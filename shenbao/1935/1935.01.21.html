<p>歐洲大陸過去一年中。堆積種種危險材料。如果稍不謹愼。皆足以激成世界之巨變。如奥國獨立問題。意南交惡問題。法德關係對立問題。無一不含有戰爭之危機。一旦爆發。皆具有廣泛之世界性。太平洋方面。自日本單獨宣告廢除海約。美日兩國間軍備競爭。日蘇兩國間之種種糾紛。愈趨劇烈。將來如何結果。亦不敢存過分之樂觀。</p>
<p>孰意今年新正。法外長訪問羅馬而後。法意卽成立諒解。法在突尼斯對意讓步并割北非屬地八萬平方里於意。同時。對其布基。阿基。阿白巴。鐵道亦承認與意國共同經營。其交換所得者。第一爲中歐和平條約。聯奥匈。捷克。南斯拉夫。波蘭。羅馬尼亞。等國爲一氣。由法意共同商榷以保障奧國獨立。換言之。卽重新結成範圍德國之聯盟。此可謂會議以外外交上收獲特殊之效能。亦卽世界大局轉機之一徵象也。</p>
<p>至於西歐危機。足以激起巨變者。當以薩爾問題爲第一。法國亦讅知爭彼區區行政權。於法所益甚少。徒足招致英意雙方之不快。更易挑起德人之反對。最智慧之對策。莫如依從當地人民投票結果。以决定行政權之誰屬。且法國於此尙保存薩爾礦區内煤鐵埋藏之權利。德國欲收取是項鑛藏者。必須凖備三萬萬以至四萬萬之金法郎以爲代價。爲法國計亦非無益。故法國於薩爾之投票。坦然處之毫不留難。德國因亦可稍紓憤懣。將來或能重返國聯以從事於會議席上之折衝。而歸於和好。亦未可知。此事非特法國能顧大局。卽英國亦甚努力。據國民社十九日電。英國掌璽大臣艾登對於薩爾投票事發表演說。謂「英國對歐政策。僅在求與隣邦締結更深切之睦誼。此次薩爾投票之解决。足使吾人希望妥恊之新紀元。業已肇始。各國如欲更進一步。利用時機以獲具體結果。則尙恊力行動而不尙口惠。吾人爲求歐洲一勞永逸之計。將於此後數月間。更切實合作。此爲維持永久和平之要素」云云。觀此演說。卽可見歐洲局面。已有轉好之望矣。</p>
<p>美國自去年底以來。受太平洋浪潮之激盪。痛感今後國際問題之不易應付遂决意加入國際法庭。以目前國際情勢論。此舉雖未必有若何效果。然爲美國計。在此時代演進之時。再難墨守存見深拒錮閉。美旣加入國際法庭。足爲國聯生色不少。而海縮預備會商形成僵局之後。英美兩國漸相接近共張其實際建艦力。以圖在一九三六年前能成立適當之軍備縮小條約設使無意外梗阻。此海軍縮小之事實諒解。可以形成。則遠東和平。亦有一綫之希望。</p>
<p>雖然。此種軍縮上之諒解。僅限於軍縮範圍之一部分也。至其他整個政治問題暗礁甚多。欲掃除此種障碍。第一要身處遠東之强國。能深切覺悟維持和平之必要。侵略政策不適於今日之世界。而後乃有和平希望之可言。不然者歐洲形勢雖見和緩國聯雖因蘇聯之加盟。意法之諒解。美國之表示好感而增加力量。然對於遠東。又將何法以處之哉。</p>

<p>（日内瓦）　英國掌璽大臣艾登對於薩爾投票事發表廣播演說、略云、英國對歐政策僅在求與鄰邦締結更深切之睦誼、此次薩爾投票之解决足使吾人希望妥恊之新紀元業已肇始矣、各國如欲更進一步、利用時機以獲具體結果、則尙恊力行動而不尙口惠、爲求歐洲一勞永逸之計、各國於此後數月間應切實合作、蓋此爲維持永久和平之要素也云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（柏林通訊）　歐洲自大戰後、百業凋零、以德國爲尤甚、但德國於最短期内、早已恢復常態、農村復興問題、又爲歐洲之嚴重事件、記者訪晤德國國家糧食處主幹部領袖文特博士、訊問歐洲之農村問題、比承接見、茲誌其談話如次、</p>
<p>目今世界各國對於復興世界貿易之願望日趨强大、而同時國際品物交易之遏制亦日加嚴厲、世人對此、似不深予注意、解决此項困難之辦法、厥爲新德國分田政策、吾人首當研究歐洲農民之槪念、究屬如何、就事實上言、歐洲國家在經濟及國際觀點上皆有彼此互賴之情狀、在此種情狀下、惟有共同合作利用各民族之利源以收取嬴利、方可稍减其困乏之形態、此固爲一增高國家消費能力之經濟問題、</p>
<p>歐洲對農民本身毫無新建之策、舊日之思想、如自英國農部領袖克隆維爾（係共和黨領袖）創開世界僑民會時、但當法國革命之後、此項意見、卽行消滅、當時之經濟競爭、爲全般市塲之敵對行爲開始時期、而農村爲經濟之基礎、則人咸置諸腦後、不復顧及矣、今日吾人細加考慮、乃知其謬、譬諸不久之前、美大總統移動麥作事、皆爲當時世人所不敢置信者、是則直接解决經濟辦法、爲一不可能之事明矣、今日歐洲農民之思想、已在復活之程序中、其新思想之根據、則爲德國政府之農田政策、農人首頒有堅穏及安全、方能産生基本的觀念、</p>
<p>德元首希特勒及農部領袖建里爲求達到此目標計、曾訂農産市塲之法則、此項法則、不單獨施行於某一已之本國、就能用於國與國間之貿易、蓋品物交易之眞性質、當在堅穏而不在投機、所致之動搖狀况、農人對此點明之甚澈、</p>
<p>德國之市塲法則、目標不盡在一已、而德國農部可因是而提高歐洲農民之生活程度及消費能力、歐洲之工業因此亦漸有生機、此項經濟法則之訂成、不單施行於德國之農産品進口、卽德國輸運至歐洲各國之出口品物、亦同樣予以施行、</p>
<p>歐洲對於農民之觀念、産生於歐洲各國仍有無限購買潛力之臆斷、此種觀念、今已成爲事實、德國商業政策之目標、厥在「貿易互援力之增加」、此項計劃、大致言之、只能就新分田法定之基礎獲取成功、市塲之法定、足以把持外國進口及防護國内出産品價格、受品物進口之影響、關於農産品」政府已建立機關、以管轄一切進口、及保證進口品物之堅穏性、目今荷蘭與丹麥、匈牙利與瑞士、芬蘭及南斯拉夫、皆以此爲根據、而訂成商業條約、在此農民與農民條約之成功、使歐洲對農民之思想亦因此而實現、後此數年、歐洲國際上訂立此類通商條約、將可不成問題、德國對上陳各項政策之實現、深表滿意、其增加進口及農産品之成效、將足使各國認德國爲忠實之顧客也、（國民新聞社）</p>

<p>國家食糧團體眞相</p>
<p>獨裁農業政策强化</p>
<p>「比一切任何事情都更重要的、是經濟的大結合、卽是在德意志全經濟之内的、一生産部門的結合、」這是食糧總長瓦塔達勒博士所說的話、其主要的意思、是想把農業方面的工作人員地主等都聯結起來、成爲和工業上各種組織的大加特爾·托拉斯一樣、他相信農産物的加特爾一定能够實現、也是因爲德國當前的經濟困難、輸出貿易旣不能向前推進、又没有殖民地市塲供其發展、所以祇好設法開拓國内市塲、向統制經濟這一方面突進、國社黨自一九三三年九月以來、就從事實現他統制農業的理想、其第一步就組織「國家食糧團體、」這個團體、以食糧總長達勒爲最高指導者、凡農業企業家·自耕農·佃農·雇農·農村合作社·販賣農産品的商人·農産物的加工業者·等等、都被强制加入、國家食糧團體的團員、必須絶對服從其指導者的領導、否則就要受嚴重的處罰、至於參與指導政策的是大地主·大農業資本家·或者與農産物有關係的大批發商人、所以食糧總長的權力增大、一般在農業上有力人物的權力也同樣增大了、這和工業方面的加特爾是很相似的、</p>
<p>關於統制穀類的法律、是一九三三年九月間就公佈了的、第一、食糧部總長有權統制穀類的生産價格、和販賣價格、根據這一項法律、糧食總長就可以决定小麥與裸麥的市塲價格、這是穀類生産者最初把穀類拿到市塲上去售賣所必須遵守的、他分全德意志爲九區、各依其地理條件、而設爲價格上的差異、并且漸次將價格逐漸提高、到今年六月、小麥價提高了百分之十二、裸麥價提高了百分之七、在這種價格之外、不准再用其他價格作市塲交易、更不准作先期買賣等投機交易、如有作這種交易的、政府卽加以嚴罰、第二、食糧總長有權命令各麵粉公司相結合、並得禁止他們對該項事業的新設備和擴張、根據這項法律、以全德國各麵粉廠爲會員、組織起小麥裸麥的經濟聯合、該聯合的主要工作、（一）是限制現有生産設備的擴張、（二）是以平均生産額數爲基準、而令各同業者依比例生産、</p>
<p>明白了上面所述的情形、就可以知道其統制的主要目的、一則是在維持小麥的價格、二則是限制麵粉的供給、維持麵粉價格、使德意志這一産業部門、不受市塲風潮的激動、人民的食糧來源、也得到比較穏定的保障、</p>
<p>一九三四年六月以後、因用穀類統制的緣故、食糧部總長的權力、竟超過了本來的權力以上、他可以統制穀類的販賣方法、和販賣的數量、又可以統制穀類商人麵粉企業等的購買原料、及販賣製造品、換句話說、就是該總長有權决定麵粉廠的製粉量、麵包公司的麵包製造量、於是今年下半年食糧總長所决定的穀類價格、與去年同時所决定的大不相同、去年决定的是最低價格、今年的是一種買賣價格、各商人在這中間就没有多大的賺頭了、現在將全德分爲十九區、各區都組織有「穀類經濟團體、」由這些經濟團體聯合起來成爲「德意志穀類經濟中央聯合、」由該聯合指揮各地方、而食糧總長處於監督者的地位、</p>
<p>不但穀類如此、卽牛奶及其他農産物品、都用相似的方法組織該項地方經濟團體及中央聯盟、來確定販賣區域、及市塲價格、德國農業統制的情形、大槪如是、（十二月二十日於柏林）</p>

<p>公法學家章淵若、應上海市教育局之請、在本市中西電台播音演講、題爲「五權憲法之基本原則、」茲錄原稿如左、</p>
<p>一、緒言今日應上海市教育局之請、到此播音演講、題爲「五權憲法、」係由教育局預定、因時間關係、未能詳述、未盡之處、容待專文補充、</p>
<p>世無萬世不移之法、亦無盡善盡美之制、韓非有言、「法與時轉則治、治與世宜則有功、」（韓非心度篇）吾國改元以來、雖徧嘗世界各國之良制、終鮮長治久安之實效、故吾人今日討論中央政制、實不能僅求不近事理之奢望、亦惟求其法立令行、「宜而有功」而已、</p>
<p>二·五權憲法之基本原則夫政治之爲物、原不能盡脫强弱之關係、無論何種政制、於其實際的運用上、均不能獨外此原則、法儒狄驥L·　Duguit)有言曰、國家之起原、因人類之有强弱、（强之一義、狄氏另有註釋、見氏著Traite　de　croit　Con　titutionel）霍勒（Haller）氏論國家之産生、亦謂由於强力、狄霍二氏、均歐洲著名學者、著書立說、學者翕從、而霍氏對於國家起原之研究、幾費念載之久、此其見解、自有至理、故現代政治革命、有與法國革命時期絶然相異之特質、是則對於議會專制之改進、以及行政權力之擴大、（參看拙著現代憲政論—中華書局版、）行政權之擴大、非即一般人民年恐懼之「獨裁、」且正足以「救濟獨裁」、「防止獨裁」、（此說詳見M·Dendiaq　les　renfocement　des　pouvoras　de　L'etal　dans　la　democratie　porlementire　paris　1932')（關於此點、愚曾於復旦大學演講「民主於獨裁」一題中、另有發揮、容再就正邦人、）此爲今日制憲者所應確認之基本原則一也、</p>
<p>總理一生、最傾慕美之總統制、其五權憲法之最高理想、厥爲實現萬「能」政府、使國家行政大權、得獨立發展、故總理民權主義、並不因襲「天賦人權」、「自由主義」之舊說、而别創「權能劃分」之說、俾政權治權、各有其範、不相侵害、此又今日制憲者所應確認之基本原則、二也、</p>
<p>三·研究中國憲法者應有之認識循上述原則、則研究今日中國之憲草者、似應有下列三點之認識、</p>
<p>（一）今日憲草中之中央政制、似不能仍襲一般憲政國家政制之窠白、迷信傳統治權衡制之舊說、因五權憲法之精義、並非在形式上增三權爲五權、而尤在運用上能提高政府治權之效率、五權憲法之衡制原理、乃在政權與治權之衡制、人民權與政府權之衡制、非在政府治權之自相牽制、以致政府效能、無從發揮、此研究今日中國憲法者應有之認識一也、</p>
<p>（二）考列國之行政部、僅受立法部之牽制、已有效率不著之幣、吾國旣提倡所謂「政府有能」之說、則行政院、似有應受立法院、監察院、國民大會、國民委員會重重限制、否則較傳統議會制度、益復變本加厲矣、考治權衡制之說、倡自孟德斯鳩、孟氏學說、自嗚客觀、謂係取諸英國政治經騐、英國政治之特長、即在三權分立、互相衡制、然英國憲法學者白芝浩氏Bagegct却力反孟氏之說、謂英國政治之優點、正在議會與行政之能和衷共濟、沆瀣一氣、初非各不相謀、互相對立、可見治權衡制、本身即非健全、且議會制度、原在限制君權、而現在之行政首領、則係同出諸民選、以同一淵源之權力、互相制衡、於法理上亦殊欠完滿、即就近代實際政治的經騐而觀、非但各國議會之跋扈專横、已深遭政家之痛惡、且因議員之腐化、與能力之薄弱、議會威信、又已江河日下、即素贊美代議政治之蒲徠斯氏、（Bryce）亦著書痛詆議會政治之黑暗、（參看拙著現代政治槪觀）故最近政治革新之原則、類均趨於行政權之强化、此研究今日中國憲法者」應有之認識二也、</p>
<p>（三）復次、五權憲法下之立法院、與各國議會性質、根本不同、蓋吾國之立法院、乃係一有、能」的治權機關、而非政權機關、故首應辨治權政權之分、不能以立法院之權、侵及國民大會之職權、且戰後各國之新憲法、對於議會之立法權、已大加限制、一方面受人民權之限制、一方面則又受總統立法權之限制、此觀波蘭、捷克、芬蘭、德意志、立陶宛、拉德維亞、南斯拉夫諸國之憲法、可徵信也、故吾國憲法、一方面固應謀行政權之增高、一方面復應力謀行政、立法二權之調整、此研究今日中國憲法者應有之認識三也、　　否者、則將來政治機稱之運用、必呈扞格難行之病態、欲求「法立令行」「宜而有功」難矣、質諸邦人、以爲如何、</p>

<p>志前兩手相推道：那越發是不敢當。你想，張先生和他是同鄉，都不便白得他的東西，我與他未曾一面，怎樣好收這三四十元的貴重物品呢？張介夫笑道：程先生覺得收下之後，非感謝不可的話，那就領我的情好了。至於他交給我了，我自然會去報答他。用不着程先生管了。志前抱着拳頭笑道：那究竟不便收下。張介夫兩手扶了桌沿，作出一個極爲難的樣子，望了玉器道：程先生眞是不肯收下，我也没有法子，不過兄弟面子上太下不去了。我和李士廉兄同程先生都是初交。士廉常到程先生屋子裏來坐，而且還請程先生吃飯去。到了兄弟這裏，不想就是送東西給程先生，程先生也是不賞臉。志前這就不由呵呵了一聲道：兄弟何德何能，却蒙張先生這樣的台愛，實在不敢當。旣是這樣的說了，我權且收下，等到張先生需要什麽東西的時候，我再來還禮。張介夫聽到他說肯收下了，臉上就有了笑容，便拱手道：兄弟什麽也不需要。若是送了朋友的東西，立刻就想朋友還禮，這人也就未免太不知自愛了，還到什麽地方去找知已呢？程志前見他如此殷勤送禮，那必是有所求的，且看他求的是什麽事。如若是小事一椿，就答應了，省得他只管來糾緾。若是不好辦的事，那也就可以老老實實的回斷了他說是辦不到。於是請他在對面坐下，敬過了一遍茶烟。張介夫先是說了幾名閑話，然後就談到本省混差事的事情上來。（一一七）</p>
<h3 id="c194">關於痰 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 召予</p>
<p>歐美人對於自已唾的痰和哼的鼻涕，多用自已常備的手巾來包裹着，帶回去做回頭貨，不捨得點滴遺贈於人家的屋中或馬路上。</p>
<p>日本人遇着涕唾，多用自已常備之紙名呌「揩彌」的來包裹成一個一個的小紙團，傾棄於紙屑箱中，贈與公役（掃垃圾人）做個紀念品。</p>
<p>中國人如有涕唾，不論什麽地方，多可以做他出品（涕痰）的陳列塲所，人家歡迎不歡迎？要看不要看？自已完全不負責任的。</p>
<p>我們從上面看來，可得下列的公式：——</p>
<p>歐美人（手巾包裹）‖日本人（紙包）‖中國人（隋地陳列）</p>
<p>歐美人涕唾的消化處：是清水消化，轉入下水道。</p>
<p>日本人涕唾的消化處：是火化塲，或下水道。</p>
<p>中國涕唾的消化處：是日光蒸晒，隨空氣散發。</p>
<p>這裏我們又可以得一個結論：是歐美人比較的傳染病最少。</p>
<p>日本人的傳染病，據他的統計，最多的是寄生蟲病，結核菌病。</p>
<p>中國人的傳染病，最多是赤痧，虎力拉，癩病，寄生蟲病，結核菌病。</p>

<p>— 戴欲仁</p>
<p>今冬天氣温暖，上海靑島均未見雪花飛揚，嶗山離靑島市約九十里，則早已滿山皆白矣。時余適因事覊靑島，聞嶗山之雪景及瀑布，頗有可觀，亟僱車往遊焉。行半小時，遙見嶗山一片銀色，經彈月橋仙姑塔，約　小時而至班房，（嶗山底）昔德人治靑，於此設警察所，相延仍呼舊名。汽車本可盤山而上，經柳樹台觀嶗村，而至北九水等處，因山坡積雪滑溜，不能上下，故止於此。乃僱山轎而上，先生柳樹台嶗山大飯店午餐，窗明几凈，西菜數盤，清凈有味，且在半山，設備精雅，夏季避暑於此，至爲相宜。餐後復乘轎經觀嶗村而至北九水，而旁泉聲潺潺，淺灘甚多，有類杭州西湖之九溪十八澗，而幽靜過之。再前行，峭壁怪石，極盡奇麗雄偉，行愈高積雪愈深，至此已有五六寸矣。道路滑溜尤甚，余試下轎步行，數步而止，轎夫則健步而馳，一若無事，經數度石級，乃至瀑布，聲如潮響，三折而下，彙成一潭，水清見底，石壁拱抱，高處刻有葉恭綽題潮音瀑三字。山中氣候寒冷，予試登臨石級，遙望山巔白雪，俯聽瀑聲，更覺寒氣凛冽逼人，擬更進至山頂，輿人云，雪深尺餘，路跡難辨，不能行矣，乃循原道而返。五時登招商局海亨輪，離靑回申，該輪係四新輪之一，行程迅速，設備完善，爲我國海輪之最完備者。且一切侍應設備，均合國人口味，國人每喜乘坐外輪，現可改乘華船，以示愛國之意，故特介紹之。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 過程</p>
<p>我走這錫澄路，還算第一次；兩年以來從故都跑到了南方，整天在揚子江的沿岸流浪着，生活的鞭子不能使我停一停脚，困憊的身子駄負着没有休憇的時光，一天過了又一天，新到上海住了還没有一個月，却又不得不將我自已摜到這條路上。</p>
<p>電綫杆是一根接着一根地在窗外飛過去了，伴着三兩棵零落的枯樹，田野間佈着凋零地稀麥芽，油菜的爛葉子像一把一把的破傘張着，幾隻瘦小的小山羊繋在道旁在尋覓着冬天殘留下的幾棵野草，時隠時顯地閃過去一堆地堆農人的破陋的茅屋—滿目是荒凉而衰頽，醜陋與殘破的景象，不由得使人想起這農村是破産了！無論是什麽，好像完全没有依據了我想象所安排的那樣，這還有什麽可說？</p>
<p>讓那些來自熱閙城市裏的初次看到鄉村的野景的公子哥兒們，去寫那頌揚鄉村之美的抒情詩罷。可是一個整年累月在四處流浪的人，幾乎每日接近這些所謂「詩意」的景緻，在我也許没勁提起興致的了。</p>
<p>長途汽車老是得了寒病似地戰慄着，搖撼着，道路是崎嶇不平而且多障碍，然而它是一刻不停，向目的地奔馳，終於將我們載到終點的江陰站。</p>
<p>人力車夫像潮湧似的奔到車站來，人聲鼎沸地吵噪與咆哮，爭奪行李和掙價錢，這是生活鬥爭的畫景。</p>
<p>「要生活就得奮鬥」！至今我不能否認這句話。</p>

<p>鐵石做的心腸，不過用爲形容詞，到底是屬於理想方面的。</p>
<p>事實告訴我們，人的心近乎糖質製成的，其實騐的例證是：甜蜜的愛情，達到高熱的程度，無論那一方的心，總是軟綿綿地百依百順；到了愛情驟冷的時候，心就相互的起了硬化，往往不念舊日的情好，各走極端了！這不是和糖製的東西，遇熱就軟遇冷就硬的現象一般無二麽？</p>
<p>因此我想：社會上男女間情愛的稱謂，叫做甜心甜心的，大槪就是根據這個製糖的原下吧？</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>伊說道：「幾百年前，我們滿洲人還是一個很小的部落咧！但是那時候的一位領袖，却有非常偉大魄力，和勇武的精神，他不能滿足於一個酋長式的生活，於是他處心積慮的計劃着，要把附近的許多部落，一齊併吞起來，合爲一個堅强富足的國家。他先自埋頭苦幹，積極的下凖備的工夫；後來他瞧時機已經到了，便毅然發動。可是附近的那些部落，一時那裏就肯低頭降服；因此，猛烈的戰爭，便開始了。勇士的熱血和頭顱，不斷的在疆塲上流着，抛擲着；而每次的勝利。總是屬於我們，眼見我們的土地，已逐漸展開了，勢力也逐漸擴張了。不料在某一次的出征中，這一位能征慣戰的領袖竟中了敵人的狡計，使他和一小部份的戰士，被圍困在像這樣大的一片森林中。那情形是的確危險極了；救兵還不知什麽時候可到，敵人的包圍是一層一層的增加了，但他一些不害怕，始終不曾預備屈服；他决心要繼續的奮鬭，以致於剩最後的一兵一卒，還是要奮鬭。可是到這一天上，他的糧食已快没有了，大家只能把殘餘的冷飯，採些野生的蔬菜夾着吃下去。第二天，他終於是得救了。後來我們的每一代的統治者爲紀念先人的勇武刻苦，不屈不撓的精神起見，到這一天上，總得舉行一個特别的儀式；這個儀式是非常簡單的，只須吃一些用不曾煮熟的山東膠菜捲起來的冷飯便行了！」說着，伊就向李蓮英做了一個手勢，李蓮英忙來不及的打發一班小太監去捧來了幾個很大的食匣。（二二七）</p>

<h3 id="c201">巴黎劇院談 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>巴黎劇院共有多少所？這是一個不容易的答案，就規模宏大的劇院而論，大槪已有一百所之外了。專演歌劇的喔畢那·喔畢那康窟，和專演話劇的法蘭西·喔帶恩，是國家劇院；至於私人創立的劇院，有演歌劇的，有演話劇的，有兼演歌劇話劇的，林林總總，說也說不清。</p>
<p>國家劇院的建築設備，是再富麗堂皇没有了，那裏的劇本，都是名家作品；那裏的演員，也都是法國最享盛名的演員。旅居巴黎的寓公，置身在這幾所國家劇院裏面，聆歌看舞，眞有此曲祇應天上有，人間能得幾回聞之感了！</p>
<p>我們在這裹，固然可以看到法國人的本性好繁華；但同時也可以看到法國人的守舊習成。各國家劇院的建築，都遠在數百年前，屋頂和樓廊的雕花，蛛網塵封，黯然减色，甚之把十六世紀的舊幕，高張在劇台之上，表示它們歷史的久遠。</p>
<p>演話劇的法蘭西劇塲，更陳列着好多戲劇家石像，皆是十九世紀以前的珍物，如孔里兩·墨利埃·　俄，和其他國内國外著作戲劇家的像，都是有的。内中有一個費爾德的石像，曾有一天潢貴胃，欲捐法郎百萬購之而不得，可以見到那些石像的價値了。</p>
<p>至於那些私人創立的劇院，其建築·設備，都較國家劇院爲新，尤其是所演的劇本和佈景，不像國家劇院墨守舊規，所以一般好新鮮玩藝兒的紳士們，多趨之若鶩。</p>
<p>劇院而外，還有所謂歌舞廳者，所演者咸爲歌舞劇。就中有一家呌做紅風輪的，舞台的佈景，演員的服裝，光綫的配合，樂曲的妙曼，皆超越其他一般歌舞廳。吾人厠身其中，實能忘却人生一切煩憂，如入安樂之宫。</p>
<p>歌舞廳之座價，較普通劇院高至數倍，平常人士都不敢問津；其中演員，泰半操神女生涯，一般普通家庭，更因之裹足。留連其間者，皆爲富商外僑，與乎走馬堕鞭的慘綠少年。</p>
<p>巴黎的影戲院，也滿列全市，所演之片，都來自好萊塢，法蘭西自製之片，則僅開演於規模較小，價値較廉之影戲院。此外尙不音樂會·馬戲·雜耍等劇院，雖然不多，也還有它們的特點，那是要看逛戲劇院的人們的口胃如何了。</p>
<p>巴黎各座院之座價，依前後高低而定其昂賤，前者高者貴，後者低者賤。大約最賤的須三四佛郎，（約合我國幣一元五毫）而最昂的亦在七十餘佛郎，歌舞廳之最昂者至二三百佛郎，一夕之歡，足値中人之産了。繁華的巴黎，奢侈的巴黎，拿這東方巴黎的上海來比一比，眞是瞠乎其後哩！—</p>

<p>上海埠際足球二次試賽、昨日下午三時在申園舉行、觀者八千餘人、頗見熱閙、列名於甲乙二隊之正式球員、如戴麟經史梅頓雪夢斯梁樹棠等均缺席、不無影響於整個上之表演、且地濕濘滑、行動艱難、尤使英雄無用武之地、我人理想中認爲他日可以代表正式陣綫之甲隊、事實上亦確有較勝之處、但以輕敵受困、結果則適得其反、蓋乙隊以六對四戰勝甲隊也、雙方陣綫如左、</p>

<p>— 陳哲雲</p>
<p>（一）縣境　鎭海在浙省之東隅，東濱大海，北接慈谿，西南則毘連鄞縣，全縣面積雖不十分廣大，但因出産富庶，故列爲二等縣，且因地處海口，爲赴甬海船出入必經之要道，爲浙東門户之樞紐，故有關塞之設立，又因形勢扼要，爲國防省防之重地，故有砲臺之裝置，卽在昔日所稱之虎狼關，現代稱之曰鎭海關者是也。</p>
<p>（二）交通　本縣現時之交通情形，較之二年前大有進步，水道則有汽輪汽油船及航船等通行，陸道自公路建設以來，則有汽車公路多道，逐漸通行客車，此外如郵政電信等，可以通達各大鄉鎭，故交通尙稱便利也。</p>
<p>（三）新醫　本縣因臨海之故，人民職業半爲漁業，半爲農業，其次則爲商界，且多爲出外營商，如在上海·日本·香港·新加坡·東三省等地，花柳病患之者頗多，可稱爲本縣之地方病其病毒多係自海外帶來，無論在城内或鄉鎭，民衆對於新醫尙多信仰，但信仰之中，仍存有迷信觀念，如一方在新醫處診治，再將診治後所購配之藥劑，供於神佛前，懺唸跪拜後而服之此種舉動，卽在智識界亦每多如是，彼等所謂人神共醫是也，舊醫在本縣則無勢力可言。</p>
<p>（四）衛生　本縣衛生行政，因無專門人員負責主持之故，對於衛生一節除一般之官樣文章，等因奉此以外，根本尙不知其重要，故在城内與鄉鎭間，均毫無成績可言，平時所謂提倡民族健康，民衆衛生諸公，此點須注意之。</p>
<p>（五）醫院　在城内則有縣立醫院一所，私立同澤醫院一所，並其他私人開業診所數所，在鄉鎭莊市有公立同義醫院一所，靈岩鄉有靈岩公立醫院一所，大碶有公立同安醫院一所，柴橋有私立蘆江醫院一所，小港有私立醫院一所，金塘有私立金塘醫院一所，並其他個人開業醫師數人，散居各鎭，但無教會醫院之設立，其中以莊市之同義醫院設備爲最好，其次則推大碶之同安醫院，靈岩之公立醫院，私立同澤醫院，縣立醫院等。</p>
<p>（六）慈善機關　（一）縣立醫院（二）大碶同安醫院（三）莊市同義醫院（四）靈岩公立醫院，上列四醫院因係公立，故附帶慈善性質，設有貧病免費號，凡持有該院免費券者，在門診時間不取醫藥費云，於時疫流行之時，上列四醫院則有臨時時疫醫院之附設，但均須收取藥費，此皆因經費關係，以致難達良好之成效，吾當爲上列四醫院代求本縣諸大慈善家，多多募捐並慷慨樂助之幸甚。</p>
<p>（七）醫師程度　在本縣開業醫師之資格，大别之爲三，（一）由浙江省立醫專畢業者，（二）由各大醫院實習畢業者，（三）由上海東南醫學院畢業者，統計全縣醫師數量約五六十人，醫師道德觀念亦佳，無派别分岐，無吹登廣告以號召病家者。</p>
<p>（八）産科　民衆對於新醫接生，亦頗多信仰，但多爲來院生産後，每不住院而卽去者，其中以上列四慈善機關，取費較低，然本縣無平民産科之創設，是爲缺點。</p>
<p>（九）新醫團體　本縣新醫無醫師公會等之正式團體之組織，且亦無新醫刋物之宣傳，去年秋季成余志醫師等，雖有鎭海新醫聯合團之組織，但其目的在乎請求衛生署設立醫師補習班，招收適合變通給証條例因過期而未曾登記之醫師之請願團體而已，並非學術團體也。</p>
<h3 id="c234">一年來之中國醫藥衛生（三） <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 江晦鳴</p>
<p>引言—醫學的教育—醫學的團體活動—醫事的糾紛—醫學的出版界—醫學的考察—醫事的建設—軍醫的訓練—舊醫藥界的一斑—新藥業的動態—鄉村衛生的調查—都市衛生觀—結論</p>
<p>（十）新藥業的動態</p>
<p>一年來國人經營之新藥事業，已有相當發展。雖製造方面，尙難與國外謙信，禮來，孔士，先靈，寳威諸廠出品相埓：然可令人有不少之滿意。中國藥廠進步最速者，首推新亞，二十三年春，漢口新設强記公司，專爲推銷新亞成藥，營業比額，蒸蒸日上，已深入四川湖南河南江西之腹地，足以抵制一部分外貨，挽回不少利權。諸如民誼，民生，信誼出品，亦多精良。各廠年銷産額，雖不詳其數字，爲大憾事；預料在此災旱之年，或能超出其他産銷出品。</p>
<p>至於製造方面，國内藥廠之動向，有盡量傾仿外貨製造之趨勢。如暑期中新亞出品之「廠痢菌汁，」爲安瓿之内服劑，在國内新藥出品上，可謂别開生面之創舉。</p>
<p>關於新藥之宣傳，似以國外廠家爲最傾心。其方法之新頴而有意義，具見層出不窮。如十月中謙信洋行所舉行之「握姆納丁」之懸賞徵文，極盡宣傳之能事。預料國内廠家，或將效法。但商人好僞心理，幾成通病，年來新藥廣告，尙有不少不顧事實，誇大宣傳者，我衛生當局，亟有積極注意之必要。</p>
<p>中俄復交後，二十三年春間，俄藥在中國市塲，曾一度傾銷，至今藥用原料，猶多用俄貨者，亦殊有一記之價値在也。</p>
<p>（十一）鄉村衛生的調查</p>
<p>二十三年九月號中華醫藥雜誌，載有李廷安先生所著「中國鄉村衛生調查報告」一文，關於中國鄉本衛生之狀况，紀述綦詳，具見心思。李氏完成此文，並有衛生署姚尋源先生之合作，故極認眞。所經調查者，計有。</p>
<p>河北省—（一）宛平縣清和衛生試騐區（二）定縣</p>
<p>北平市—西山鄉村衛生實騐區</p>
<p>山東省—歷城縣龍山衛生實騐區</p>
<p>安徽省—和縣烏江農民醫院</p>
<p>江蘇省—（一）蕭縣（二）鹽城（三）泰縣（四）句容（五）江寗縣（湯山衛生實騐區事務所，江寗鎭衛生事務所等縣立醫院</p>
<p>上海市—（一）吳淞（二）高橋（三）江灣等鄉村衛生模範事務所</p>
<p>浙江省—（一）吳興（二）武康等縣立醫院</p>
<p>廣東省—廣州家庭促進會</p>
<p>依調查之結果，中國鄉村衛生已經建設者共十七處，量的缺乏，可無疑義；更從調查所得之一般狀况而言，其不良之印象，約有六端：</p>
<p>第一，設立未能並遍。第二，組織不能一律。第三，爲時不多。第四，經費竭蹶。第五，人才缺乏。第六，工作單調類似而不專門。综括一言：則中國鄉村衛生事業，猶在試騐萌芽時期，雖各地工作，趨重治療與防疫，徒以設立未能普遍，尙無若何良好成績可言。雖然，上海高橋鄉村衛生模範試騐區等，頗多良好設計與表現，但僅局於一隅·故吾國鄉村衛生，較之泰西各國，旁落人後，自不待言矣。不禁深望吾界同仁，及負有衛生行政之責者，積極亟謀鄉村衛生事業之健全，以求普遍發展，並確定今後改進之方針。</p>
<p>關於鄉村衛生機關歷年遞增之量，以民國二十二年爲最進步。二十三年中。僅增加一處，何其迂緩？吾人感於鄉村衛生事業之重要，尤不可忽視鄉村衛生建設之「量」的增進也。茲附歷年鄉村衛生機關之遞增表，藉明梗槪。</p>

<p>（五十一）再歸熱（下）</p>
<p>（問）再歸熱一席退熱後，到什麽時候又要再起發熱呢</p>
<p>（答）通例在一度退熱後，經過五天到七天之後，又起第二次的發熱。</p>
<p>（問）這時候的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這時候也和第一次發熱一樣，起惡寒戰慄而發高熱；但程度和持續時間，却都减少。</p>
<p>（問）這樣的反复發熱到幾時纔止？</p>
<p>（答）再歸熱，大都祇有到二回或第三回發作，就得終止；間或有第四回或第五回發作的。可是這種情形的時候，他的間隔愈長，並且發作時間也愈短；熱度也愈低。</p>
<p>（問）再歸熱照前面所講的，固然是普通正規的經過；但不知有没有異常的經過呢？</p>
<p>（答）也有異常經過的；可是很少。</p>
<p>（問）再歸熱的異常經過，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）再歸熱的異常經過，有的是發作回數少，持續短，而忽然停頓的。有的是很像瘧疾那樣發作的。又有發神經性狀態，或起黃疸，皮膚和黏膜出血，吐血，瀉血等的。這機的情形，特别稱他爲膽汁性再歸熱。</p>
<p>（問）發再歸熱的病人，有没有合併症？</p>
<p>（答）也有發生各種合併症的。</p>
<p>（問）那幾種合併症，容易發生於再歸的經過中呢？</p>
<p>（答）除了支氣管火、支氣管肺炎之外，有起脾臟拴塞，或脾臟膿瘍的。因此而引起腹膜炎，非常危險。</p>
<p>（問）此外還有什麽合併症？</p>
<p>（答）還有發頑固的衂血，顯腺炎，痢疾狀的瘍病，出血性腎炎和虹膜炎等。至於循環器的障碍，却很少。</p>
<p>（問）我們在遇到再歸熱的病人時，應該怎樣診斷？</p>
<p>（答）診斷再歸熱，應該注意發病狀况，是不是以惡寒戰慄，而急劇發病，脾腫，熱度的再發等。此外可檢查血液中的病原螺旋體。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>（問）這種病的預斷，吉凶如何？</p>
<p>（答）再歸熱，病狀無論怎樣重篤，但死亡率很低，僅不過百分之二到四。</p>
<p>（問）再歸熱的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在發熱期的初始，就可以用砒素製劑的洒佛散（Ｓalvarsan）或新洒佛散（Neosalvarsan）（就是通稱的六○六和九一四）注射，因爲病源是螺旋體，所以這類藥品，有特效</p>
<p>（問）應當怎樣預防本病的傳播？</p>
<p>（答）因爲這種病，是由於吮血的昆蟲傳播的，所以預防方法，在乎驅除臭蟲蝨·蚤等</p>
<h3 id="c236">三民主義與醫學 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>三民主義是治國平天下的不二法門，牠的精義是質諸百世而無疑，垂之萬古而不朽的。這也無庸我們的贅述，現在所要說的，僅僅是關於醫的一方面。換言之，就是三民主義醫學的關係。</p>
<p>（一）民族</p>
<p>民族這兩個字的　　太大了！在表面上看來，許多革命先烈犧牲了無數的熱血，無非爲復興民族。但是這個目的至今終未能達到，醫業僅爲百業中之一如何能負這樣重大責任呢?須知這種見解是錯誤的。復興民族的途徑雖然不止一條，但是最根本最基礙的工作，確非醫師來擔任不可。古人醫說：「强國必先强種，」這句話有着十二分的至理，換句話說：就是有健康的人民纔有健康的國家。人民將怎樣纔可以健康呢?這問題非空言所能解决，必需脚踏實地去做的。健康的大敵是疾病，所以愈是有健康的民族，他的疾病的愈多：死亡率就愈衆。何以故呢?無非因爲人民的不知衛生，以致一切傳染病等：都相襲而至了!未病的時候，旣没有預防的凖備，已病了又往往因爲醫藥事業不發達—如醫師之不敷分配及醫院太少等—而枉死了的不知若干。這樣，民族自然一天一天地趨於衰老的一途了！我們祇要看一看歐西的先進國家，他的文明程度不是同他的人民的健康成正比例嗎？同時他的醫業事業和衛生事業的發達不是同他的文明程度人民健康又成正比例嗎？明瞭了這一點，就知道醫和民族的關係了！即如我們中國，人民的不振作可謂達於極點了！然一究其原因，則大半由於疾病和不衛生而至，肺結核的普遍流行就是一個顯然的證據，因此而弱種流傳，愈遇愈弱，在這時補救的方法除掉醫師是任何人不能擔任的，如何而可以，預防疾病撲滅病菌？如何而可以普及衛生知識？在在皆有賴於醫師的工作和宣傳，我們的同道呀！趕快地負起這復興民族的責任來吧！</p>
<p>帝國主義者的侵略，是日甚一日了！幾乎可以說是無孔不入·無隙不鑽；單以我們醫藥界而言，這種現象是愈趨愈顯明的。外醫呢？在華的勢力是一天天地澎漲起來，外藥呢？那格外的充塞市塲了！但是後一種不過每年侵略吾們巨萬的金錢，至於前一種呢？那眞是危險極了！以非我族類的人而託以民命，對於民族的前途是多麽的危險啊！吾們這時唯一的要緊工作，就是怎樣的銷滅外醫的在華勢力，以挽救民命於垂危之地，同時怎樣的仿造外藥，抵制舶來，以挽回國家的漏巵於萬一。我想，這種工作，對於民族的安危和國家的權利上，不能說是不重要的啊！</p>
<p>（二）民權</p>
<p>只要細細研究民權二字的定義，就可以知道民權者是無論何人所同具的一種權利是也。但是因爲職業的關係，往往於普通的民權之外，還有一種特殊的權利，在實際上這種權利，也是民權之一，不過適用於一種職業的人，而不普通罷了！這種權利，在醫師的就呌做醫權。各國的醫師法規，對於醫生所應享的特殊權利，每每訂得很詳細精密。因爲不如此醫師對於職業上就在在的感覺棘手了！我國則不然，社會對於醫師旣不能明瞭其應有之權利，而醫生自身呢？也常常不知道他是應享有職業上的特殊權利的。於是醫權橫遭掠奪，甚而至於連普通的民權都被漸漸侵蝕了！觀於現在一二年來的醫病糾紛，就可以知道。病家可以非法控告，官廳可以非法逮捕；非法監禁；這不是連普通民權都被侵蝕了的證據嗎？我們爲維持職業上的安全起見，爲衝開四週的惡環境起見，不但要維護我們應有的民權，還要力爭我們應得的醫權，我們要拿發揮民權的精神來發揮民權之一的醫權，對於先總理的民權主義不是很合的麽？</p>
<p>（三）民生</p>
<p>民生的要素，第一就是生産，這是無論何人不能反對的。生産力的高低，是操之於護工階級，似乎與醫師是没有關係的。但是細細地研究下來，不但有關係，可以說得生産力的多寡，幾乎間接的操在醫師手内，什麽原故呢？生産力與人口的多寡是成正比例的。人口多的國家，他的生産力時常充足。要得人口衆多，就非死亡率减少不可，要得死亡率减少，更非國民有强健的體格不可。怎樣使國民的體格强健，怎樣使死亡率减少，這就非請教我們醫師不可了！所以醫業對於民族有直接的關係，對於民生有間接的關係。而這種間接的關係，并不亞於直接關係的重要啊！</p>
<p>根據以上三點，可以知道醫業對於先總理的三民主義有很深的關係了！我們旣然明瞭了三民主義與我們本身的關係，那麽進一步就要研究到怎樣發揮三民主義的精神，怎樣擔負這種重大的基礎的工作，我要奉告社會人士不要以爲醫是小道而加以輕視，而我們的同道也不要自視爲小道而忽略我們應負的天職和應享的人權啊！</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（三十二）猩紅熱（續）</p>
<p>病原—當今醫學昌盛的時代。大家都已公認狸紅熱是一種急性發疹傳染病。是同麻疹，風疹，痘瘡，水痘等病一樣的。可惜他的實在原因。至今還是不明。雖有研究家報告本病的病原菌。但是尙未能得至醫界確實的公認。不過就連鎖狀球菌血清治療猩紅熱的成績上看起來。似乎以連鎖狀球菌爲本病病源菌的學說。較爲接近。</p>
<p>傳染力—本病的傳染力特别强大。尤以在有熱的時候。同他的恢復期中。傳染最强。傳染的機會。不必一定要從病人的衣服，臥床，書籍，玩具等物。有時竟可因和病人同室少頃而卽傳染。他的病毒。大都存在病人的組織，體液，分泌物，和排泄物。所以病人的血液，眼淚，鼻涕，痰唾，大小便，上皮落屑（恢復期中）等等。都有傳染的能力。</p>
<p>年齡—五歲左右的小兒。最易感染本病。在十餘歲以至二十餘歲的年齡。常易感染。若過四十歲。那就難於感受。</p>
<p>病毒侵入的門户—大槪是從咽頭扁桃腺（俗稱乳蛾）。</p>
<p>流行的時季—本病在人口繁雜的各大城市。雖可四季流行。但是總以秋冬爲甚。</p>
<p>猩紅熱的潛伏期—大約從四日至八日。但是亦有少至一日多至兩週的時候。</p>
<p>猩紅熱的前驅期—本病的前驅期。就是惡寒戰慄。發熱頭痛。惡心嘔吐。精神衰憊。咽頭作痛。嚥下困難。此時的體温。大都高達三十九度或四十度。</p>
<p>猩紅熱的發疹—前驅期發生後的第二天。就是體温昇騰已達極度的時候。於是開始發疹。本病所發的皮膚紅疹。比較他種急性發疹傳染病所發的皮膚紅疹。很有特異的地方。他的發疹。初爲鮮紅色微小的斑點。密布皮膚表面。這種斑點。增廣甚速。所以不久卽可互相牽連。融合成片。（未完）</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（二）甲種齒槽膿漏症之療法</p>
<p>—外科療法—</p>
<p>（一）刮去齒石。齒石爲此症之主因。必須刮去之。刮時須用特製之儀器。庶免傷及牙肉齒根膜及牙齒。</p>
<p>（二）施行外科手術時。須非常注意。以免硬質齒石。飛入醫生或病家之眼中。</p>
<p>（三）在未刮齒石之前。患者之口腔。須用一種消毒水漱口數次。洗去口内汚物。（普通用肉桂水加入百份之二酒精）。</p>
<p>（四）刮牙手術必須依照次序施行。先刮某部齒牙。使其齒石完全刮去。然後再刮他部齒牙。切勿隨意亂刮。各種儀器最好安放於一特製之托盤。浸以一種悅口之消毒藥水。</p>
<p>（五）此症之囊袋甚淺。齒石較易刮去。括時以一小時爲度。刮後再輔以硅砥石橘樹片浮石粉絲綫及毛刷等洗刷。此症齒牙並未搖動。毋須器械裝鑲」</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>—藥物療法—</p>
<p>（一）齒石刮去後。須用消毒藥水將齒牙周圍刮下之齒石剩屑。及浮石粉等洗刷冲去。患部用棉花卷拭乾。然後用適宜之收歛劑（如Zinc　phenolsulphonatic,potasufodidi　lodi,mentbolis等混合溶液）·塗於齒齦部及齒槽間。保持數分鐘後。再用消毒藥水漱口。此種療法每次施行之。至治愈爲止。</p>
<p>（二）患者同時須注意口腔之清潔。每日將牙齒與牙肉。洗刷摩擦。並用消毒藥水時常漱口。</p>
<p>（三）近年頗多用百分之五雙氣亞明丁（5%Dichloramin_T·)溶於cblorocosane注入囊内。極爲有效。</p>
<p>（四）含收歛性之漱口藥水。切不可用。因其長期使用可以妨害唾涎之發酵作用。如必須使用時。最好製成牙膏。用以洗刷牙齒及牙肉。</p>
<p>（三）乙種齒槽膿漏症之療法</p>
<p>—外科療法—</p>
<p>（一）如有硬質齒石。必須完全刮去冲凈。</p>
<p>（二）如硬質齒石。不易刮去時。可先用cbloroglucin_sulphuric　acid塗注於囊袋深部。卽可使齒石崩解分散。然後再刮。</p>
<p>（三）如無齒石。則囊袋亦須洗刮凈。然後方可施行藥物治療。</p>
<p>（四）每次治療之齒牙。不可太多。大約一齒至四齒爲限。</p>
<p>（五）如有無法治療之齒牙。則必須援去之。以免傳染其他齒牙。</p>
<p>（六）如上下齒牙咬合不正。因此某部齒牙。咀嚼時壓力過多。必須設法改正其咬合。將突出過高之咬合面順序用車石略爲磨平。使全部咬合平均。惟磨時必須注意到全部齒牙之形態及美觀。不可磨去太多。以免傷及齒髓。</p>
<p>（七）凡齒牙之囊袋甚深而齒髓之生活力又微弱者。或須用以裝鑲金屬物使其他搖動之齒牙固植者。或其知覺過敏者。其齒髓以抽去爲宜。</p>
<p>（八）有時施用各種手術及藥特治療後。經過不良。並無效果。而囊袋依然存在。此時囊袋多已深及五粍以上。事實上無法阻止其傳染。必須將形成囊袋之外壁牙肉。用手術破開至囊袋底。或成V字形割去。將内部齒石汚毒刮去洗凈。症之重者。且須將牙肉完全割開。再將齒槽死骨。及患部肉芽除去。方有收效之望。</p>
<p>—藥物療法—</p>
<p>（一）乙種齒槽膿漏症所用之收歛劑療法。與甲種相同。惟時間較長。繼續治療約二三星期卽可。</p>
<p>（二）如遇頑固難治之膿囊。膿汁常流。則膿囊内須用125%至50%pbenolsuPhric　acid以腐蝕患部（别種酸性藥不可用）。</p>
<p>（三）吐根素（Emetin）之療法。齒槽膿袋内常發現許多口頰阿米巴（Endameba　buccalis)及各種寄生蟲(parasites）可用吐根素療法。以撲滅微生物。阻止化膿。吐根素療法有</p>
<p>實效者有下列二種。</p>
<p>皮下注射用○·五厘鹽酸吐根素製成溶液。皮下注射於身體適宜部位。每日一次。約三四日後。每隔一二日再注射一次。口頰阿米巴約六日後卽可消滅。</p>
<p>内服藥片　内服愛兒克拉司打衣必格藥片（Alcresta　lpecac　Tablets·）。每日三次。每次二片。飯前一小時用温開水送下。約服五日後。可停服七日。再續服五日。此藥片在施行外科手術治療時或治療前卽須開始服用。内服期中。如略現輕瀉症狀。可無妨碍。如泄瀉增加。可停服三四日。衣必格藥片。不特其撲滅微生物之力强。又可醫治驰緩易出血之牙肉。及因局部刺激而起之發炎症狀。</p>
<p>（四）鹽酸尿素奎寗　（Ouinine　and　Urea　bydroobloride之療法。用此藥塗于患部不特可撲滅口頰阿米巴及螺旋菌。且帶有酸性腐蝕作用。用此藥時先將囊袋冲洗次乾。于是將此混合劑製成之藥片一粒。放于玻璃片上。加二三滴蒸溜水。調成糊狀。送入囊内。用几士林油膏暫時封好。約五分鐘後。囊内之藥物。用温水冲去刮凈。此藥用後最好再用腐蝕劑以滅除患部肉芽。可用硫酸銅（Copper　Sulpbate)及百分之八氮化鋅溶液）Zinc　Cbloride）製成厚糊狀。囊袋洗凈吹乾後。將此糊劑塞入囊内。輕微磨擦。使藥物浸入囊底。然後用几士林或用（Chloro_percha·）溶液。暫時封好囊口。再用碘酒塗佈子牙肉全部。隔三四日後。再施行同樣之治療。約三至五次當可痊愈。如此時囊袋仍未縮小就愈。則必用外科手術除去之。</p>
<p>（五）凡種種藥物療法。不能收效者。則惟有用外科手術割除。方能見效。</p>
<p>—器械裝鑲治療—</p>
<p>除用外科手術。及藥物治療外。非常搖動之齒牙。須用器械裝鑲法。使其固植。所謂器械裝鑲法。不外下列數種。卽金套。橋牙。金嵌鑲。金嵌板。及各種金屬保持器。使搖動之齒牙用器械固定之方法也。</p>

<p>（六）X光的診斷</p>
<p>在今日社會間，有一句很流行的舊話，尋常拿來作贊美醫者用的；呌做：洞照癥結。這當然是過甚其辭的，就是身受者也有同感的；但如果移來表明X光在診斷上的價値，那是没有比較再切當的了！作者敢說一句，就是除開病理解剖一方面外，對於本病病性的認識，無疑地是推他首屈一指的。不錯，前面所述過的物理檢查法，聽診打診的工作，對於現症的認識，看時候確是和他異曲同工的。但物理檢查祇是一種間接的手續，技術上的訓練究竟純熟與否，固屬大者出入；退一步說，卽使此種難點完全免除，他所能達到的範圍，也是有一定之距離的。假使　灶的所在，和肺表面距離太遠了，那是完全没有法子的。决不像X光的診查，祇須經過透視，對於病灶面積的大小。疏密，形式等種種，均能一覽而無餘的。所以他在本病上的應用，差不多個個病者都應該經過這種檢查手續方行的；就是有本病嫌疑的人們，大半也藉這方面的所得爲最後之肯定的。</p>
<p>X光應用於醫學診斷上，係憑藉何種原理呢？尋常一般人的揣測，謂係用鏡照視臟腑，這完全是耳食之談，毫無意義的。我們要曉得，X光是有莫大之透過力的，對於人體當然並非例外；此外，他能使有螢光機能物體，如藏化白金援留膜Barium_platinCyarun之類，發放螢光的。試將藏化白金援留膜板（卽透照板）置X光綫之前照視，卽可見着鮮明綠色之燐光放出的。其問假如隔以人體，則因種種物體性質之不同，而現明暗不同之影響的；像血液骨骼是現濃影的，筋肉是現淡影的。肺部是含氣組織的器官，故能X光綫通過，現肺野，於透明板上的。所以我們也可以因影之濃液情形，而檢定病理的組織，以及異物之存在與否的。</p>

<p>日本芥川龍之介寫了許多年的文章，有一次忽然像是發痴了似地在書上寫着：「我們爲什麽而從事文學的？」</p>
<p>這問句驟聽起來似乎非常可笑，其實這含有很大智慧的話，過後會給你無限深厚的回味的。我們每天孳孳不倦，伏案在讀一些「文學」的書，並把自已所感到的也寫了下來，可是就缺乏一個機會，將這活動加以眞摯的思考的。一旦聽到旁人指破，方纔如夢初覺地恍然大悟，其實這只是一些最淺近最平常的道理，而我們竟很少有人去揭發。在這短短的一生中，也許有的人學察了而决定他生活的轉機，也許有的人還在讀着，寫着，等到大運來時，竟是追悔不及的或竟是依舊糊里湖塗地死去。</p>
<p>眞的，我們究竟爲什麽而從事文學的呢？</p>
<p>據法儒伏爾泰回答，他是爲寫出他所想的，然而這答案是太玄妙了。有島武郎說，他是有四個目的而寫作的，一是爲了寂寥，二是爲了愛，三是爲了想愛，四是爲了想鞭策自已的生活，這答案就較中肯綮了，然而作了寫作之外，不是有更多的途徑來達到他理想的嗎？朝也寫，暮也寫，把人們最不放在心邊的文學來作爲自已整個生活的基礎，而妄想拿一管三寸毛錐筆來澄請天下，這想頭眞豐富地妝飾着吉訶德先生的色彩，像有島那樣有膽識的人，在這種地方不知何以慒懂至此。</p>
<p>只要縱的看看歷史，橫的看看各個民族，不是無數聰明睿智的人在那裹學着文學，在那裏寫作嗎？他們的理想不同，當然寫作的目標也各異，卽以我國說吧，有的是爲了要傳名而寫作的，有的是要作爲進身之階而寫作的，有的是爲了要得到稿費而寫作的，有的是爲了想發表之後有女人寫情書來而寫作的，有的是爲要誇耀鄉里而寫作的，有的是要發洩那「輕烟樣的悲哀」而寫作的，有的爲了要相互標榜而寫作的，而終其極，則像拉斯金所說的那樣爲失去金錢而歌唱的人也儘有着呢，當然其中也不乏嚴肅寫作的人，想用文學呌喝出他的理想，和追求光明之憧憬，但他們除了「寫作」之外，究竟做出些什麽東西來呢？</p>
<p>在這裹，我並没有否認文學的功用，文學是組織生活的手段，而能給社會以頗大的影響，屠各湼夫獵人日記之促進農奴解放就是這說法的最好的例證，但我的意思是：一個眞眞懂得生活的人，他是不去舞文弄墨來寫那白紙黑字的書的，他是蔑棄一切細碎的活動，而用整個生命去寫「歷史」那本大書的。他也許終身不提一提筆，然而他在靜默中所做成的成績却足以使這些所謂「文學家」們爲之汗背，爲之愧煞！</p>
<p>一看了那麽豐富而美麗的生活，那麽我們這些玩弄文字魔術的，拿新技巧騙飯吃的，尋章摘句的，摛掞詞藻的，發着烟樣幻想的另一夥的人們，還在恬然說着自已是世界上最高尙的人，眞可說有些厚顔！</p>
<p>聽了屠格湼夫書中巴札洛夫的話：</p>
<p>—俄國需要我……不，顯而易見的，毫無此種需要，需要的是誰呢？皮鞋匠，成衣匠，屠户……賣肉給人…屠户……</p>
<p>文學家可爲而不可爲，早已有人先我而說過了，但我的意思是，如果僅只寫作一些無聊的東西，那還是寗願做一個皮鞋匠成衣匠屠户的吧？卽使我們寫作的話，我們要力避某一班人口頭上所謂的「文學家」，這並不是個十分好聽的名詞。</p>

<p>— 先河</p>
<p>天已經黑下來了，我們却還得走路，眞是氣餒。雖則是急急的走，但深山的寒氣，却很尖銳的從四面襲來，使我們不但不感到一點温暖，反而更覺冷得難當。風在吼着，那狂暴的聲音，彷彿發自漆黑的半空，又像是從深山冷塢中捲起，我們只覺得一陣陣的陰寒，刀割似的徹人肌骨，可是辨不清風向。</p>
<p>山澗中原有泉水，日夜不倦地流着，穿過樹林，穿過岩石。但這時也給凍住了，冷靜靜地，聽不到它那低聲的，温柔的，像囁嚅似的歌唱。鳥兒當然也是絶跡了的。羣山浮在重濁的雲霧中，　巍巍地飄動，像雲霧載不住它們的重量，隨時都有倒下來的危險。想到那種山崩的，震天驚地的響聲，我們都覺得悚然，彷彿地底已在震動，已在旋轉了似的。</p>
<p>過嶺的時候，情景特别的嚇人。那兩面筆挺的山脊，簡直像兩道不可飛越的，齊天的峭壁。它是愈走愈深，愈深愈窄，你只能走一步算一步，决不定你第二步跨上去的地方，是安全的境界，還是葬身的深淵。但氣餒是不行的，你只能懷着胆肝俱裂的恐怖，切切實實的在巉岩上移動脚步，不必回顧，也無庸前瞻，因爲向前看看是雲霧，朝後看看也是雲霧，渺渺茫茫的，究竟把你引往那兒去呢，又誰能知道？</p>
<p>沿嶺所有的叢林，大多是老松，黑鬰鬰的，即在深濃的夜霧中，也隠約看得出邊際。天掛在叢林上面，寒冷而且寂寞，似乎跟老松的枝頭緊緊地黏在一起，除了濃淡的區别，更没有别的界限，我想在晴朗的晚上，那清澈的月光，照着這蓊鬰的，四季長靑的樹林，當山風吹過的時候，就到處嘩然地響着波濤澎湃似的聲音，到處黑白分明地動着松枝的，映畫似的影子，那種情景該是非常的富於詩意的吧。</p>
<p>可是在這雲霧和黑夜的包圍中，在這寒冷凝凍的深山里，松風却像狂暴的虎嘯，悽厲的猿啼，嘈雜的狼嘷，完全消失了詩意，剩下來的只是恐怖，陰森，是種非人間的，惡魔含血的怒號。雖則在寒風括得輕一點的時候，它們也放得低聲一點，但那仍然不像天朗氣清微風拂過時一樣的温和，一樣的迷人。却也不是雄偉的，爽朗的。它給寒風應和着，呐着喊助威，那種暴戾簡直會使人一想到就要齒冷。</p>
<p>路十分迂廻，有時向左，有時向右。我們脚底觸着的，全是非常尖銳的石塊，如果不穿着鞋子，準會給劃得皮破血流。有時彎彎曲曲的，簡直會引你闖進什麽山洞去，進又不是，退又不是，前後左右圍着的全是岩石，枯草，汚穢而且冰凍的泥潭。如果頭上也壓着石塊，那黑黯得簡直只能摸索，不碰碎頭或者擦掉了鼻子，總算是萬幸的。即使頭上有一條石縫吧，射進來的光綫也是陪淡糢糊得很，而且風也跟着吹進來，雪也跟着飄進來，反而比在漆黑一團中更要寒冷。在峻峭的陡坡上，走起來尤其艱苦，因爲積雪很滑溜，只要心一抖，就有粉身碎骨的危險。</p>
<p>濃霧漸漸的退成蒼白，以前原是一片漆黑的，現在却是一天灰茫了。風吹得很緊，雪片開始飛了下來。我們雙手抱住頭，可是雪片却依然飄進我們的衣領，鑽入我們的心底。我們凍得僵硬了起來，連發抖也不成功，因爲我們的皮膚都已凝結，不會收縮，骨頭也像石膏糢型似的堅硬，不會屈曲，全身只是感到刺徹肺腑的疼痛，好像麻木，又好像清醒。一種關於鬼怪和猛獸的，茫然的恐怖，像霧氣似的升上我們的心頭，一直湧上咽喉，窒住了呼吸，阻碍了思想。全世界都在我們的眼前和周圍旋轉，我們的脚底，彷彿就是一個剛剛陷落下去的，萬丈的深淵。</p>
<h3 id="c242">懷疑主義者在中國 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 白萊</p>
<p>「世界是一大騙局；人生是一遊藝塲；大詩人，大文豪，……全是一些大騙子…」像這樣把懷疑主義强調到極峯的說教，多年以來，在文藝的製作上，在戲劇的演出上，以至家庭間的規箴，朋友間的互勉，這種思潮正像洪流那麽猖獗地注入每一個年靑人的血液裏。便這樣，我們這代較年輕的一羣，就沉浸於這種懷疑主義的雰圍裏，成長着；並且慶幸自已的老於「世故」。</p>
<p>「天眞」已然成爲「愚蠢」的别名了。</p>
<p>這恐怖的現象正一天天地深入而且擴大·使我不由地想起「沙寗」的作者阿爾志巴綏夫曾假借書中人物的嘴巴說過這樣的話：「……只要我的死能殼拯救人類，那怕背負十字架而死，我也甘願的……然而世間却没有一椿値得我這樣去死的事…」（大意如此）從阿爾志巴綏夫底筆觸下强調成功的懷疑主義的典型，在今日的中國，正廣泛地存在着。</p>
<p>自然懷疑主義者多量的産生，正有着客觀的社會條件的根源。從而我們在都會裏的舞塲上，酒排間，…隨處可以碰着不少靑年人以威士忌，女人…來排遣他們每一個寳貴的日子；作爲逃避現實的處世哲學，他們是成功的。</p>
<p>到現在，要是有人把這現象解釋爲「世風日下」，「古風淪亡」…這就只好把它當做天曉得的夢話了。</p>
<h3 id="c243">公園對於我 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 狄舟</p>
<p>自已是與公園無緣的人。從前在别的地方，早上散步於長長的馬路上，是日常習慣之一。待到步跡落到這「國際」商埠的地上以來，這習慣也由不能延長而消滅了。但不是說，因此我就常到公園去。恰恰相反，不是特别的時間，我只蟄居於屋内，或奔波於街上。生活上能與公園聯系的，只有那相當舒服的小康者，或在此以上的人。</p>
<p>第一個與我接觸的公園，應算虹口公園。那時很小的我，看見滿團黃黄的秋葉，也不禁愴凉之感。喜歡一個人立着，展開廣闊的視野，點點地與大自然的呼吸合流。記得共總只到過三次，時間似乎都在冷天的季節裏。末一次的情調，宛然心與景一體。</p>
<p>「狂飈呀，捲着雲頭到來吧！我期待，我翹冀，</p>
<p>我期冀你帶來拜輪的歌聲，和古希臘英雄的偉力！」</p>
<p>唱着這樣的歌。心頭硬塞，像是千百種的感慨，只由這兩行歌中表現出來。其實，形成當時那樣心情的原因，并不是對於社會有深刻的認識，由這認識而有所感，因而憂世憂國起來—只是受了那時流行着的文學内容的影響，而生起對於自身周圍一種暗淡的視綫。—雖這樣說，間接所受的，是社會的整個趨勢，却是無可置疑的事。</p>
<p>大約過了二年，和一個新認識的友人，同上兆豐公園。是初春的早晨，暖意已如人在呼吸中感覺到了。晴朗之下的園景，使我寬展了兩手，像落在母親的懷抱着，享受的片刻恬靜的休息。我想，沈重的工作過後，能到這裏來，給自然撫慰一會，即會恢復疲勞吧！但想到能常上這裏來的，僅是些紳士淑女們，和些昏醉的智識份子們，便空虚起來，厭煩這樹的幹滿目，木的芽靑靑的敞明園地了。</p>
<p>開始了談話的我們，立即將四周的景色忘却了。只那略帶甜味的朝氣，不停地在心内釀出喜悅的新液。</p>
<p>在這稍前，我曾進過法國公園，是人來强拉，不能不無味地跑得去的。我不喜歡那個地方。所佈置的「美景」，除與人以陳腐，平凡之感外，别無其他，至於歡笑於天堂的搖籃裏的西洋孩子們，那天眞，活潑與可愛，雖博得一般遊園者的止步，但於我，却引不起興味，略略與我以躍動的，還是接着環龍路而引向園内的那條平直白色的走道，及兩旁亭亭立着的繁茂的法國梧桐。</p>
<p>最近一次的踏進兆豐公園，是今年的仲春時分。離先前的那一次，已是相距三年了。表面没有變，如她所屬的這都市一樣，但也如她所屬的這都市一樣，她的内質是起着一個變化了。那就是日本人的意氣洋洋的面孔。男的，女的，西式服裝，傾心的笑，擲着簡單的排球球式。此外，另有年靑的，偕影於池畔；壯年的，拖着手杖，二三人慢步而談。我想：這現象不能說與日本人在這都市之勢力的膨脹，没有關係。顯然，即在遊憇的一角，木屐兒也以侵略的鐵釘顯示她的勝利之姿容了。我不多逗留，快快地繞了一圈，就走了。這和我絶不願意將步跡印上七月十四日之夜的法國公園，同一理由：不高興睹視人家的「德威」和「光榮」。</p>
<p>這些公園裏，鳥兒花兒自然多的是，正如施脂抹粉的仕女們之多一樣。但牠們對於我，是不用眼看，不用耳聽的，所以，更無需用筆寫了。最近，有朋友自南方來，說X市的甲於全國的公園，已只剩得大自然豐富的綽姿，在那裏獨受凄凉了。說X市市民，不知怎樣，一同不向那裏去。聽了，我不禁很爲這「國際」都市的人們隠憂，也許會有一天，這裏的公園，也頓呈荒凉，園内都是朶朶株株的「夏日末了的玫瑰」。（完）</p>

<p>後來，經我的朋友多番證明，告訴她我是怎樣規矩的人，從來不親近女色，只因爲要多開些眼界，多見識一些事務，所以才領來看看，除此之外，别無他意。他還說些假話恭維我，說我是個怎樣怎樣好的人，學問多，心思更不壞，並說明我從來没有假藉自已的職位，尋過别人的差錯。</p>
<p>她放下手。這最後的一段假話，像是很打動她，她的臉上伏出微笑來，向我抛了一眼，說聲「那麽兩便了，黎主任，」就把身子躺到炕面上，開始燒烟。我的朋友緊跟着躺在她的對面。</p>
<p>我這位老友，現在可不像從前那樣老實，從前他是一提到女人就紅臉的一個，而現在，不但把面前事務能够處之泰然，並且還時時和女人戲說些下等醜惡的話語。女人也不避我，伸手在他身上亂摸，同時，他也不停地摸着她。</p>
<p>「這大槪就是私家烟館昌盛的原因？」</p>
<p>我正在這麽想，我的朋友歪着頭問我道：</p>
<p>「怎麽樣，這是個好地方吧？」</p>
<p>說完，他的眼色落到烟燈上出神。</p>
<p>女人已經烟槍上上好了一個烟泡，遞到我的朋友手中，他放進嘴裏就抽起來，於是，烟槍發出嗤啦嗤啦的響聲。女人用烟簽子在烟泡上不停手撥弄着。</p>
<p>「這是件有趣的事情。」</p>
<p>我看了一會，不由引起這種念頭，可是等他抽過了三個烟泡後，屋裏抽滿了重重的烟霧，我抵不住烟薰了，鼻官也受不住刺激，老實覺得頭昏。我不甘願再在屋子裏受這無辜的刑罰，就叫起來：</p>
<p>「不行，我受不住了！我頭痛！你們另外還有屋子麽？要麽我就先走了。」</p>
<p>「有地方，有地方，到東屋去罷。」</p>
<p>我的朋友聽了我急叫的話，放下嘴裏的烟槍，急急地說，那意思我是猜得到的：他不是怕我先走，剩下他一個人，走路時没有趣味；再不然就是覺得有些對不起我，使我受了這點罪。他還想說什麽來的，但讓女人的話攔住了，她說：</p>
<p>「小菊，你把黎主任領到東屋去，陪着玩一會。」</p>

<h3 id="c246">財政狀况之窺測 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>（一）原因有内外之分</p>
<p>資本主義國家的財政恐慌，一個原因由其内在矛盾銳化的結果；經濟活動力衰退，一般納稅力下降，造成了歲入不足的現象。一個原因是由他向外侵略的野心之亢進，所以常年地支出龐大的軍費，把民脂民膏消耗在不生産的槍砲造艦等的糜費上，膨脹了國家的歲出預算。同時還有一個内在制度上的自殺作用，各國的統治階級，因爲要保障他們資本的蓄積過程，便用政治上的權力，將租稅的負擔，都轉嫁到大衆身上去；復將其榨取所得，在借公濟私的手段下，大量地增加對救濟費補助費公共工程費等名目的支出；以謀緩和其一般的恐慌，同時加速其金融資本的獨占過程。於是一方是歲出膨脹，一方面是歲入銳减，把國家自身弄成了貧窮化，達於自殺的悲劇中，完成了財政恐慌的過程。</p>
<p>可是在我國，恐慌的形態，當然不盡相同，但其程度之嚴重，還遠超於各國之上。究其由來，原因却别有所在。</p>
<p>第一：我國是一個次殖民地的國家，在世界資本主義國家中，一方是提供原料，一方消融他們過剩的商品。當世界的原料市塲都發生了過剩的現象，我們的國際貨付，便再也無法維持其均衡，在常年的對外貿易入超之下，促成了殖民地經濟機構的解體，寄生在上的國家財政，便從基礎上的發生動搖。</p>
<p>第二：當列强用武力侵略的過程中，又榨取了我們鉅大的賠欵；在他們的經濟侵略過程中，又用投資借欵的方式，以其金融資本的鐵鏈，鎖住了我們的咽喉；在重重的賠欵和外債的枷鎖下，便把我國的財政壓碎了。</p>
<p>第三：我國又向來是一個「有財無政」的國家，造成這種局面的，有二種原因：一是政治的不上軌道，財政活動也就長期混亂。一是中了傳統思想的毒，中國的大丈夫，對於理財之學，向極輕視，所謂「君子不言利」，所謂「與其有聚歛之臣，寗有盜臣」。大家都取了這種消極的態度，結果反放任了「聚歛之臣」的各私其利。因此，如其有政，也都只是隨意榨取，隨意分用而已，積幣旣久，現在要翻身，當然更難。</p>
<p>第四：封建勢力的猖獗，造成了政治的不統一，財政也就無法統一。現在的情形，或可說已較前進步了許多，但是殘餘的封建勢力，無可諱言地還没有澈底殲滅。因此近年整理財政的呼聲雖然很高；還不免常受到種種政治上的牽掣。</p>
<p>第五：思想界的輕視財政，所以理財的專門人才，也就特别缺乏，同時「吉利」之人，又咸視財務爲發財捷徑，如關卡稅務官塲中都目之爲肥缺，因此廉潔之風，絶無僅有。中央雖三令五申，但陽奉陰違者尙大不乏人。即如去年下期，暴露的田賦舞弊案，已不勝枚舉。如松江縣政府的共同侵蝕稅欵十數萬元；如沭陽的田賦舞弊案達十餘件之多，每年鯨吞國稅有十萬元以上；如蘇州的征收主任朱某的侵佔國課至五十餘萬元之鉅，又如睢寗縣的合股包辦櫃書，組織貪汚集團等等；此尙係公開暴露者；至未舉發的黑幕，不知還有多少？因此，財則糜費，政則紊亂，無怪財政恐慌，越閙越兇了。</p>
<p>（二）形態則古今不同</p>
<p>近年中央對於改造財政，力除積弊的工作，確在不遺餘力，令人感戴就過去一年以内，對於整理稅制的問題，更顯出特别努力的决心。到現在雖尙没有什麽顯著的實績，但已足以使吾小民爲之興奮有止。因爲稅制如能整理刷新，則財政上最困難的問題，可說已解决了一大半。但就事論事，問題之難，還是在制度本身之外。現行稅制的混亂與不公道，就是前列五大原因的結晶。</p>
<p>我國是一個次殖民地的國家，連年的内外侵蝕，變相摧殘。早把國家弄成澈底的貧困，澈底的破産。近年世界原料市塲的過剩，促成了我國的農村經濟破産，都市經濟因下層基礎的空虚，已踏上了瓦解之途，靠着整個社會經濟來孕育的財政經濟，也就走到了山窮水盡的地步。所以過去是「有財無政」，現在幾乎要「無財爲政」了。「有財無政」，還只是人的問題；人事解决，比較上還算容易。但「無財爲政」，那是事實上的問題：事實上的部題，就有非人力所能及的困難。所謂巧媳婦煮不出無米飯來，這才是最要命的事。現在對於整理稅制的口號，特别努力，或許就爲這種關係。如果由於此種關係而從事於整理稅制，這是否發揮整理稅制的意義？暫且不去理解，不妨先來看看整理稅制的財政背景如何？</p>
<p>（三）危機到如此地步</p>
<p>現在我們所聽到的關於平衡預算的對策，總是說要開源節流，所謂開源莫非是增稅（？）今日倡導的整理稅制，是否就是這種步驟的實現？姑且不論，就依我國今日的租稅現狀中去窺看財政的前途，已不能不有所懷疑。</p>
<p>在我國的中央稅收中，以關稅爲第一位財源。自東北關稅被僞國扣留以後，他的稅收，在總預算中，還是佔百分之五十二。到了前年，乘中日稅則期滿，宣佈修正稅則，將輸入大宗之若干貨物，略加稅率，故在預算中，關稅的收額更提高了起來：他對總預算的比率，故已增爲百分之五十三。但其决算時的實收額，却還較預算减少了百分之五。可是到了去年，一方在預算中反將關稅的收入預算額提高，一方反又放棄前年的稅則，重頒新稅則，將所增的各項稅率，大量地削减到以前的狀態。此種辦法，粗看似乎莫名其妙，但明白在經濟上二加二常少於三的理由的人，也就能理會他的用意高深。蓋削减輸入大宗的貨物稅率，必可增進其該項貨物之輸入量，因此他的稅收，或可希望他增加，至於此種結果必將打擊國貨工業，那是另一問題；然此種挖肉補瘡的政策，能否如願以償？現在已有事實證明。</p>
<p>查二十三年度的國家預算，對於關稅之歲入假想額定爲三萬八千餘萬元，較二十二年度的假想額三萬五千餘萬，元已增加三千餘萬元。但是據二十三年份的關稅實收額（包括進出轉口船鈔及附加等稅之總收入）共三萬三千四百六十萬元，較二十二年份之三萬三千九百五十萬元，减少了六百萬元弱，而其中進口稅减少額即達三百餘萬金單位，充分的宣示了去年新進口稅則之財政意義的失敗。稅則財政會計年度與普遍年份不同，但是近年對外貿易的一落千丈，已剖明了一般購買力的下降：因此縱欲運用這等間接稅的方法，去增益稅收，可是因爲轉嫁的餘地之日狹，終爲現實所迫得徒勞無功。現在預算上已將關稅的假借額提高了，同時報上又盛傳將重行修正進口稅則了如何修正我們現雖不得而知，但無論怎樣，假使有設法維護國内的産業，改善國民的經濟，那末任何嚴厲的財政關稅政策，總是没有辦法的。</p>
<p>再看鹽稅那也是中央寄以無窮希望的財源之一。當東北的鹽稅被僞國扣留之後，二十一年度的鹽稅收入假借額嘗一落二千餘萬元。現在東北並未收復，可是預算上的鹽稅假借收入額却已逐步提高，如二十三年度的預算且已超過東北未失之前，而開空前未有的紀錄。如九一八前的民二十年度的鹽稅預算爲一萬六千餘萬元，民二十三年度却已激增至一萬九千餘萬元。這種激增的收入，當然由增加關内國民食鹽的負擔才獲得的結果。日本攖去了我國的東北，攖去了我國的財源，便要我開内的國民來負擔這種責任，賠償這種損失，爲維持國家財政計，本爲被侵略國家人民不得不然的義務。不幸食鹽是全部人民生活上一餐不可或缺的條件，增加鹽稅的稅收，便是增加人民食鹽的負擔：也就是增加人民生活的負擔。無論今日所實行的整頓鹽務的手段，只是鹽斤改衡，未增稅率。但將十三兩一錢的市秤去替代十六兩八錢的司馬秤，實際稅率的變動，已日十分的重大的了。近年鹽價的暴漲，豈不就是一個明顯的例證，現在我們又已聽到關於統一全國鹽稅稅率的計劃，我國各地鹽稅稅率的懸殊，本有力加統一的必要。但我們擔心統一的方法，只是把低稅率抬到高稅率相等的地步。依現在最高的稅率，有每擔抽十四五元者：而低稅率的地方不過是三四元，因此如果採用此種辦法的話。那豈不是又使低稅率的地方之人民的令鹽負擔，又陡增了四五倍嗎？食鹽的公賣，原欲防止奸商的壟斷市價，同時也使國家在此獨占中增進財源的方法。但其根本的立塲。應兼顧社會民生與財政稅收，那是無楞疑義的，可是現在怎樣呢？</p>
<p>在國稅方面，我們還應提到的是統稅，這也是中央重要的財源之一。雖設立不未，但是他在歲入預算中的地位，也無限地擴張着。他主要的征收對象，是民族工業，在財政學上，爲了要普遍地去分配租稅負担，這原也是一種相當的方法。所以我們就是不論他在財政的社會影響上的情形如何，即就依財政本身上的目的來說，那就是有没有寄以無窮的希望之餘地，靠着這統稅收入的增加來帮助財政上的發展？我們知道：統稅在歲入中的地位，已自民國二十年的百分之九，增到現在的百分之十五。這就是說，他的重要，已較前增加了一倍左右。依二十三年度的收入假借額已定爲一萬一千七百餘萬元，故平均每月應收九百萬元才能如其所願。但事實所在，去年首八個月的實收成績，平均每月不過八百六十餘萬元，像七月份的收入額還不過六百四十餘萬元。因此爲彌補預算上的不足，自然再增其稅率，所以紗粉統稅率的增加，現已成爲中央勢所必行的目的物，是在實行的遲早上罷了。但是我們知道，這種實收的不足，即以其稅率已超乎納稅點之上。換一句說，就在於已在國民納稅力以上。現在還想提高其稅率，豈不犯了因果倒置的病患嗎？</p>
<p>中央如此，地方又何　不然。誰都知道，維持地方財政的財源，那便是唯一無二的田賦。現在是在高唱經賦附加的聲中，在農村復興的口號之下，這原是非此莫屬的對症良藥。但事實成效如何？且容别論。這裏我們且看看農民現有的負担，便知整理地方稅制時應取的方針，是什麽？據中央農業實騐所的調查，農民的納稅負担，近年有增無减，他們統計的結果，是在全國二十二省六百八十七縣的農民負担，已較前增加了很大。各省平均水田的稅率，在二十年份是當田價的百分之二點另七，民二十一年份已增爲百分之二點三七，民二十三年份更增加至百分之二點六八。至於旱田的稅率，其增加速度更大，在民二十年份是當田價的百分之二點三六，民二十一年份增至百分之二點五，民二十三年更增至百分之二點八。依中山先生的遺教，似平規定爲只征地價的百分之一，現在是否在依照這遺教百從事輕賦呢？姑且不問。但在如此增加農民的負担之中，能否解决了地方財政的收支不足呢，不，不，有千百萬種事實告訴我們，地方財政的貧困，比中央更來得兇狠。就以二十三年度的各省新預算來說，那末無不一省不是大虧又大空。如廣東虧空五千萬，浙江虧空七百萬，安徽虧空五百萬，河北虧空四百萬，甘肅虧空三百萬，江蘇虧空三百萬，福建湖南察省等各虧空二三百萬，其他尙不知道。</p>
<p>在這大虧大空下，他們彌補的辦法是什麽呢？便是發行公債。嫌公債的發行手續麻煩的地方，便乾脆地實行借欵。各地所發公債的名義與所舉借欵的理由，都是萬分堂皇而冠冕的。如發行地方公債的，有浙閩桂，發行金融公債或庫券的有鄂粵新，用建設名義或治水築路等名義而所舉的新債，有蘇豫浙湘冀魯閩等。復有浙魯等的絲繭借欵，浙蘇等的設倉借欵，而鄂皖湘等又有賑災公債，據報上零星的材料，綜計去年一年内，各省將發已發的新地方公債與新借欵項的總額達二萬五千餘萬元。所謂公債，所謂借欵，就是增稅的先聲。因爲他們的本息償付，羊毛出在羊身上，還是要國民大衆來負担，而且反又給國民增加了付息的負担，替各銀行財團又多向國民取得了一項「利潤」。</p>
<p>（四）將何術以善其後</p>
<p>如果我們要提出「如何是好」的問題？那末率直的答復，便是「切實的節流」。</p>
<p>我們應該曉得，各國的財政，雖則也都靠租稅來做台柱，但是總没有像我們這樣利害！譬如拿一九三四—一年度各國財政預算的實例來看吧；英國在七萬萬鎊的歲入中，租稅的收入估六萬六千餘萬鎊，佔百分之九十四，要算是情形最大的了。美國在四十四萬千餘萬美元中稅收佔三十七萬九千餘萬元，佔百分之八十四，可列爲二等。第三便是德國，在六十五萬萬馬克的歲入額中，租稅佔五十二萬萬，佔百分之八十又九。復次便是法國，歲入總額是五百萬萬法郎，稅收是四百萬萬法郎，佔百分之八十。至於蘇俄。那簡直少得很，預算總額達四百八十八萬八千餘萬盧布，租稅收入不過三百三十萬萬，僅佔百分之七十三。而且此種租稅，又都向社會化經濟部門征收的，直接向國民征的租稅不過二十萬萬盧布。可是看看我們呢！那末每年的總預算中，租稅總要佔其總額的百分之九十五以上。法國和日本的内閣，常因提出增稅方案而被議會投反對票推翻，他們國民經濟要比我們好得百十倍，尙且對於租稅政策，還表示太苛擾人民，何况我們？</p>
<p>然而事實是擺在面前，在這内憂外患聲中，我們不能不作抗强禦暴之計，因此我們非有充實的財政資本，去從事於各種建設和必要的凖備不可，但是要使社會經濟不回復一點兒，那末任何空話，也都没有價値。在這左右爲難，對立的矛盾之下，我們自然應該實行雙軌制度，這就是一方站在蘇息民困的立塲，去整理稅制，從力除積弊中去增加稅收，從平均分配租稅負擔中去將養人民，要是我們能將租稅的負擔平均分配，同時减少浪費，力除積弊，那末民衆的稅負雖不見得能减輕，但到少能得到公平的感覺而心悅誠服，這於財政的意義也未始不能達得增進收益的目的。但是看了上述的事實，眞能增進多少收益，希望是有限得很！所以重要的力事撙節，切實節流！換一句話說，就是「量入爲出」，這作者在本刋上也曾一再倡之。</p>
<p>節流本也是我國當局今日所高唱的口號之一，但實際怎樣，我們倒有加以一顧的必要。</p>
<p>我國財政支出上的二大洪流，便是軍費和債務費。這二者的支出，常年地消蝕了中央三大稅收的全部。因此我國的財政預算，實即就是軍務費受債務費的支出務算罷了。債務費是平日種下來的病根；現在只好嘗受這個惡果，因爲過去的常年收支不敷，一味的借債還債，因此越陷越深，那是勢所必然的結果。過去是飲鴆止渴，只顧眼前，不想後來：現在也就没法可想，要節已無從節起，所以也就不必說他。</p>
<p>至於軍費，過去是爲了抗日，爲了剿匪，攘外是安内的雙官並下，軍費的膨脹，本屬無可如何的不得已之事。現在失地尙未收復，强敵依然侵迫未已，但是剿匪工作，據說已將告一結束，但是要使剿匪成功，蔣委員長早已說過，應該三分軍事七分政治，則今日若不切實復興匪區，後患依然難滅，這樣今日的行政費用，當然較前要有相當的增加。</p>
<p>不過無論怎樣，二十三年度的新預算並未做到「節流」的原則，是無可否認的。我們不必說别的，只看了財務費依然佔總歲出額的百分之九以上，已可想見。如果我們在總歲出中除去了債務費，軍務費，當務費，及補助費之外，那末財預費在中央各項政務費中竟佔百分之四十五以上，實爲世界任何一國所未曾有過的。依照事實，東北四省被人奪去，阿彌陀佛，我們可以略略减少了這等地方的財務費之支出；近來又實行廢除厘卡，並將印花牌照等征收機關合併裁撤，也可以减少不少的財務費。但是新預算的財務費反增達六百九十二萬餘元之鉅，較上年度的六百五十萬，增加四十餘萬之多。無怪立法院的財委會主席馬寅初氏在會議上要大發牢騷？可是馬氏的奮鬥，爲了「財部必難遵守」的理山而屈服，結果只得馬氏的意見，作爲編造下屆預算時的參考，而將原預算案照案通過。那末做國民的也就只有寄希望於未來了！</p>
<h3 id="c247">標金市塲之回顧 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 何伯雄</p>
<p>（一）價格之變動</p>
<p>民國二十三年度，上海標金市價變化之劇烈，實爲僅見之記錄。統觀全年金價，最高價達一千零八十七元正，最低價祇六百六十五元五角，相差達四百二十元五角，漲落波瀾之宏偉，由此可見一斑。最大之動力，實由於美國白銀政策之威脅。茲誌近一年來上海標金價變動槪况如后：</p>
<p>二十二年十二月份，上海標金市况。初旬國際間消息極爲紊亂，致金市時有起伏；而其間美國之購金政策及安定滙價之傳訊，尤爲推動金市波瀾之原動力。及入中旬金市突現驚人之低峯，於一日間連跌進六百八十至七百元之重大關，良以電傳美總統已批准銀恊定，並諭令購進白銀短盎斯買價爲六角四分半等消息傳至，致金價狂跌。</p>
<p>二十三年一月份，金市極爲穏定。</p>
<p>二月份，初旬金價亦極平庸。及入中旬，金市尤見蕭條，蓋一則廢歴年底即屆，各方結束，一則更換新結價（見第三節），掉期時有所顧忌。（按：標金之買賣有期貨及現貨之别，買賣之期間即有所謂掉期及交割期，掉期乃每月月半給與交易者買進或賣出之猶豫期間，交割期則爲月終標金買賣之交付期。）及入下旬，市塲人心猶虚，交易仍未暢旺，迨旬末因銀市跌風甚厲，金價漲勢頗勁。</p>
<p>三月份，以全月長期趨勢觀之，則逐漸挺進，初旬國外消息紛歧，市價不定，而美國銀價提高問題，與安全滙兌之說，尤足引起滬埠標金市塲之巨大波瀾，金市愈形堅挺。復以國際銀問題，風聲傳播，益足以助長金市之興旺。月底以國際消息複雜，金市幾完全受美國銀問題之支配，結果較中旬末漲九元三角左右。</p>
<p>四月份，標金市况，自中旬初迄下旬，　美國白銀問題，有延擱之消息，金市吐露　芒，猛速上漲，良以美國銀案毫無進展，且羅斯福總統有拒銀立法之表示，及日政府將收買純金等消息傳來，金價尤有不可一世之槪。統觀全月最高金價，竟達一千零二十七元七角。上海標金，自美金貶値，更改結價之後，因國際間之金銀經濟問題之錯綜複雜，標金市價之極形混雜。</p>
<p>五月份，上月間標金猛速上升，詎至是月份更扶搖直上，最高價爲一千零八十七元，下旬美總統有徵銀利益稅百分之五十之消息，金市復稍稍退縮，最低價爲九百九十一元二角。是月份爲上海金價自改變結價標準後之發現最高低兩重新紀錄，差額達七十九元一角，亦爲本年份之新發現。</p>
<p>六月份，市氣極爲平穏，金價之上落，亦極微細。及旬末因有英拒付到期欠美戰債及銀問題複雜，金價始稍有風波，其趨勢則略爲疲弱。</p>
<p>七月份，市氣亦極爲堅穏，統觀全月金價，最高低差額祇有二十二元九角，爲一年來之最平定者。</p>
<p>八月份，上旬因美國重提通貨膨脹，而銀價回長，金市跌風陡起，英美銀價飛漲，而美政府宣佈將白銀收歸國有，停止期銀交易，因之滙市奇鬆，人心大虚，跌勢加厲。及傳我國當局因外商銀行裝運大宗現銀出口，行將設法制止，或加徵銀稅之說，大户紛紛扒空，價遂突飛猛晋，竟漲至六十五元半。旋傳美國黃金流出，滙兌趨小，價復回進六十元。月底突傳美國又擬膨脹通貨，買户束乎，金價復跌，可見是月份金價波動之複雜。</p>
<p>九月份，標金市况，以海内外消息複雜，變幻至爲劇烈，蓋本月初旬之末，財政部有取締標金外滙投機之令（詳見第四節），月秒有倫政金價之上升，皆足以影響標金之市價。初旬先漲後跌，尙無劇變。中旬以財部不准標金照外滙爲結價標準，改用世界金塊折算之關金爲標凖結價，市態凌亂。下旬以國外銀市及滬市外滙步長不已，國際消息又極複雜，市况發生劇變，跌風益厲。全月平均價格僅九百零六元，爲近五六月來之最低者。</p>
<p>十月份，國内外消息紛歧，而海外銀價升降較巨，益以財部於十五日起實行加徵銀出口稅及平衡稅以後，致標金市况，變幻至爲劇烈。英美銀價雖無過甚之跌落，而滬埠則以外商　　　奇，滙市奇緊，華高恐慌，雖紛向失結，殊難得乎。金價漲風之烈，銳不可當，最高價格。竟達一千零二十五元之鉅。</p>
<p>十一月份，自上月金價掀起狂潮以後，趨勢較爲平靜，然於中旬之末，及下旬之初，金價高低仍日有十餘元至二十元許之差度。滬上現銀初復有鉅額流出，至銀根步緊，洋拆提高，嗣經財部令海關嚴爲緝私，并運輸國内各埠，亦須當局核准，請發護照，方可裝運，更有種種利於多方之傳說，是以金價循序銳進，及二十四日竟高至一千零二十二元半。茲將一年來上海金市經過槪况表示如次。</p>

<h3 id="c252">危文繡再嫁王葵軒 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 無法</p>
<p>黎元洪妾危文繡，日前在靑島再嫁王葵軒爲妻，危年四十三，王僅三十餘，社會引爲笑談。其實在普通人家，莫說小老婆再醮，不以爲奇，便是大老婆再醮，也是絶不希罕的事。危文繡因爲是黎元洪的小老婆，再去嫁人，社會便引爲談助，說危文繡是在拆爛汚了。而黎府中人，也必定認爲奇恥大辱，辱没家門的一件事，這也難怪。</p>
<p>在民國史上，人類是平等的，黎元洪雖曾一度爲大總統，卽使黎氏現在並未物故，總統卸職，卽與平民無異。並且現行法律，不准取妾，所以小老婆卽使有不軌行動，就是本夫尙在，亦無法告訴。現在黎氏已故，危文繡對於黎之家庭，更無絶對不可脫離之關係，故危文繡之再嫁王葵軒，原是很普通而極平常的事。</p>
<p>至於宋儒所謂「失節事大，餓死事小，」的學說，原是一個道德問題，旣非法律所能裁制，更非傍人可加干涉。「妾心古井水，波瀾誓不起。」此種幽嫻貞靜的美德，求之古人，尙屬難得，求諸今人，更鮮可能。而况求諸今人的小老婆呢？「天要落兩烏雲起，娘要嫁人横心起。」所以黎氏已故，而他的小老婆要下堂求去，只得聽其求去，欲瑟琶别抱。只得聽其别抱，只有危氏自身的人格問題，本和黎氏家風，絶不發生任何關係也。</p>
<p>至婦女再醮的原因，不外三點：（一）性慾衝動。（二）經濟壓迫。（三）爲家庭所不容。危文繡旣侍黎氏二十餘年，經濟壓迫，當可無慮，惟文繡身已四十三歲，而醮一三十餘歲的丈夫，其性欲衝動，或所難免。更觀其信中所云，不能容於後人，則危氏爲家庭所不容，亦可槪見。如此一再醮間，而雙方兩得其便，在危氏旣何樂而不爲，卽在黎氏家庭，亦去此一只眼中釘，尙何深責之有。</p>
<p>有人笑謂，危氏年已四十有三，而王僅三十有餘，賣大男小，似覺可怪。其實此亦毫不足異之事，試觀現在女子，虚榮心非常發達。妙齡少女而嫁五六十歲的老翁者，往往而有。則王葵軒之妻危文繡，恐亦　女子的心理相同。如其不是爲金錢所誘惑，便是一種「人生之謎。」他必疋認爲危氏係大總統之妾，娶危，是附驥尾而行益顯。或者又以爲黎氏之妾，與尋常之妾，畢竟不同，故不問其年齡之奚若，而有一娶之價値也。</p>
<p>現在婚姻製度，幾等虚設，所以離婚案件。日見增多。並且妾之身分，在法律上本無確定，則何必視黎元洪妾之再醮，而有所特别重視。此眞所謂夫子猶有篷之心也。故爲之詮釋其意，以告世之認此事爲異數者。</p>

<h3 id="c253">臘梅 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 小鶑</p>
<p>臘梅，是開在冷的氣候裏，因爲冷，才顯着牠格外的芬芳，卓越，具備着一種可愛的風情。</p>
<p>那色調，是怪愛人的，粉紅色的外衣裏着紅紅地芯子，不用枝葉的扶持，多嫩，像一個少女的面頰，流露着笑，在笑裏，那無限的風情挑逗着人們的心，呵，這豐滿的少女之而呵！</p>
<p>大槪是那風趣的一種誘惑麽？禁不住的，我也買了小的一盆，供在案頭的一角，從窗子裏吹進來　素的寒風，那麽冷，寒　在周身流播着。固上窗子，是那裏來的一陣清香呢？回頭看看，案頭的臘梅又笑了。</p>
<p>臘月，對於我是多感的，一個紀念的季節呵！</p>
<p>是臘梅初開的時候，爲了想履行自已的想像，雯走了，走了，那麽决絶的，好像這一去有絶大的把握是的，朋友們，在盡力的勸着，希冀她能有一個比較深切的反省，然而這些，是不能搖動了她的分毫，她曾肯確的認定自已的理想是對的，只有依尋着這條途徑才能獲得了幸福。</p>
<p>一月，一年，時候竟悄悄地溜去了，没有一絲的痕跡。在這無情的歲月中，雯的消息，沉没下去了，不，她是淡淡地在人們間被忘去了，卽使能有，也不過在回想中所留存的一些印象而已。</p>
<p>實在，當一個女子出嫁以後，一切的消息會引不起人的注意的，在某一次，由間接的朋友當中，知道雯已經生彦了，而且還是男的。照理，在宗法社會的制度是没有消滅的時代，這是可賀的，但，揣測畢竟不能成爲事實，有的時候，或竟會與事實相反的。</p>
<p>天，又冷了，臘梅又在吐着清優的芬芳，不知怎麽，每逢到這種時候，我就會想起了臘梅，就會連帶的想起了同臘梅具備着同樣色調的雯底姿態。於是，禁不住的，會購備一兩盆擺在案頭，這彷彿已養成了一種癖好，但是一個絶大的奇蹟。我想不到，無論如何也想不到，會在臘梅的花市中看見了雯，大槪她是不願意被我發見吧？怱忙的預備走了出去，可是，來不及了。</p>
<p>臉，瘦了，眼角上，也貼了幾條淺的紋溝，臘梅的色調不見了，少女時期的風韻呢？</p>
<p>由談話裏，知道她已經離婚，知道她的孩子已經死去，更知道她們離婚的原因，是基於「色衰」的一點上，最後，她的眼圈有點紅了，自然，她的内心是很難過的，悲痛的。</p>
<p>我没有方法來安慰她，更不知當時的感想怎麽會如此的複雜。回到家裏，看看案頭上的臘梅，那散的花瓣，漂落到書上，盆里，色調，還依然的鮮艶，但壽命，竟也如此的短促喲！</p>

<h3 id="c255">從月蝕想起的話 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 戈白</p>
<p>獨自在燈下讀書，鑼鼓爆竹突如地嚮了起來，在這萬籟俱寂的冬夜裏，聽來像發生了戰爭時轟襲擊一樣，不由地抛了書本跳起身來；但是立卽聽到孩子們的歡呼和咒駡，報上讀得的月蝕消息在腦膜浮現出來的時候，竊笑自已驚惶失措的態度。</p>
<p>孩子時候，也曾參加過這種咱們古國特有的典禮，一半亦是受着不良教育，私塾的先生告訴我們說，這是野月吃家月，我們應該鳴鑼擊鼓，把野月趕走；但是我們以「否則」以下的話來質問先生，先生是没有回答了。實在私塾制度是祇有先生質問學生，而學生是没有開口的餘地的。現在這許多孩子不受不良教育的影響嗎？於是我想到我們教育的態度太欠嚴肅，十年窗下爲的是上朝做官，而出洋留學同樣爲的是做官。這樣被官的迷夢努力着讀書，到現在甚至没有噉飯之地，想起來眞是打哈哈也太勉强了；這是題外的話。</p>
<p>不過許多明知不是野月吃家月的高等華人不是同樣犧牲了睡眠時間在參加這個盛會嗎，這你將怎末說法呢？</p>
<p>幾年前，謠傳幾盡夜天不亮，大家彷彿過年似的囤草積糧，並且對這黑暗時期感到異常的恐慌，一若這世界將要變成個可怕的模樣，然而從謠傳到今天爲止，太陽是每天在規定時間内從東方起來，這些追求光明的人們反沉湎在黑暗里。在霓虹燈的世界中，本已没有月亮的地位，卽是野月吃了家月，於他們有什麽損失呢？</p>
<p>由此我想起一個故事：某甲佇立路旁仰望天空，某乙見而奇之，亦佇立而觀，於是某丙，某丁……待甲驚覺，則已被圍於人羣中矣。或人問甲以故，甲曰：「我豢養之鳥，脫籠而出，止於對屋之檐前也。」</p>
<p>中國人的「瞎起勁」和「無事忙」是最出色的本領。越是不干自身的事，他們最肯出力，否則是於心不安的，然而眞是帮助人家的事，反袖手旁觀了。被稱爲「奇怪的民族」，不能說没有理由。</p>
<p>晚上的月蝕，如其是野月吃家月，大家擊彭鳴鑼，對於月的本身是否是一種帮助？明知月蝕是天空中自然的現象，也來瞎胡閙一陣，這又有什麽理由呢？</p>
<h3 id="c256">回唐山 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>天一亮，二桶稀得没有米粒的粥水就擺在陳阿發的面前，他們草草地吃過，陳阿發就和幾十個年壯力强新的老的的番客，　　地從「波立廊」田來，「波立廊」就是警察局的意思，這種一般人呌警察署都稱呌「波立廊」。給幾個穿着黃色制服的「波立廊」，（Police）像押送犯人似的在發着光的柏油馬路上走着。</p>
<p>雖則是清晨的時候，可是熱帶的太陽，却熱烘烘的晒在他們的頭頂上，背脊上，熱辣辣地，使他們覺得有點難受，額角上滲出了黃豆般的汗水，直淌到背脊上，把白斜紋布的外衣也都浸透了。然而他們却得不到安息的自由，儘管跟着幾個「波立」，毫無目睥地順着這光滑修長的柏油馬路走下去。</p>
<p>「到底要到什麽地方去呢？」</p>
<p>「送到「北欖」去築鐵路嗎」？（「北欖」是位於暹羅灣，由我國的輪船進暹羅境去最先經過的地方。）</p>
<p>「還是送到孟叻去修理皇家公園」？</p>
<p>每個人的心裏都隠藏着這個疑問，自危陳阿發也不能例外，心坎裏焦急得像熱鍋上的螞蟻！可是，每個人都不願意開着口說出來，默默地，一拐一拐地，拖着笨滯沉重的脚步。</p>
<p>後面跟着一羣看熱閙不關痛癢的野孩子，他們越來越多，跳着，吵着，嘻嘻哈哈地呌喊。</p>
<p>經過每條街道，兩旁的商店的店夥都停止了工作，跑到店前來看熱閙，像正月裏鄉村中看神遊似地仰着𩓐子呆望着，慢條斯埋大發共議論——</p>
<p>南洋的一般人稱祖國做「唐山」。）</p>
<p>「大槪不是吧，最近可没有發生過什麽案子？」</p>
<p>「也許是這班人今年納不了「人頭稅？」聽說今年不能繳納「人頭稅」的人，一查出來就毫不容情地送回「唐山」。………」</p>
<p>這些話這時在老番客陳阿發的耳朶裏聽起來，是大大地不以爲然的。他以爲他在暹羅也已度過二十幾年悠長的歲月了，平日的做事，自信還能守本分，不敢胡作亂爲，勤勤謹謹地做個順氏。暹羅，簡直是他的第二家鄉了！雖然這幾年來暹羅的生意不大好，到處都碰不到工作做，閙着失業的恐慌，使他每年不能按期向皇家繳納「人頭稅」。可是，皇家的器度是寬大的，只要這些不能納稅的人，向皇家義務地做一星期的工作，那就可以白白地領取一張繳納「人頭稅」的熱照。這兩年來陳阿發就這樣地領到他的「人頭稅」的熱照了。因此，這句「不能繳納」「人頭稅」的人，一查出來就毫無容情地送回「唐山」的話，無論如何在老番客陳阿發的心坎裏是絶不敢相信的。</p>
<p>路越走越覺平坦寬大，這使陳阿發覺得比往年有點異樣，雖則他很肯定絶不會就送回「唐山」去，可是，他的心裏總是有點就　　急，不　！</p>
<p>…」他們的隊伍中有人低聲地嘆息。</p>
<p>陡然地陳阿發把頭兒抬起來，那高巍巍的海關，莊嚴地已横淌在前面了，湄南河中那艘開回「唐山」龐大得像小山似的「夏隆都」輪船，巨大的黑烟囱，靜靜地吐着團團的黑氣，他們在幾個「波立」暴力壓迫底下，猪玀般給趕上輪船了。於是，陳阿發的迷夢打破了，他望望岸上帶着熱帶風味的建築物，靑靑的綠草，快樂輕鬆的行人，他不禁想起當初離開家鄉搭「紅頭帆船」到暹羅來時的企望，和「唐山」里的老婆和兒子還眼巴巴地望着他寄錢去養活，以及這次潦倒不堪被迫地回「唐山」，他的胸膛就好像給一支毒箭穿過似的痛苦，眼涙滔滔地從眼眶裏淌出來。</p>
<h3 id="c257">弄堂小學 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 史維之</p>
<p>讀廣告，據說有時候會比讀新聞更有趣。譬如在本埠分類廣告裏，你時常會有機會知道一條狗和一個人的價値，而在别方面，你又可以增進許多讀新聞所不會有的知識！要是逢到有什麽廣告口戰之類那情形就更熱閙可觀，再不然，衹要你肯耐心去翻，有許多上好資料是大可選入幽默文選的。</p>
<p>再來個譬如吧，譬如今天報上就有XX小學換老闖的啓事，那啓事是委託律師「代爲聲明」的，這村的妙文埋没了　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　「據XXX來所稱，XX小學校長XXX因無暇辦理，推讓于XX接辦，所有前校中債務糾葛等情槪歸X君負責，除立據外請爲登報等情，據此代爲聲明如上，再校務銳意改進各家長可至XX路報名登記」</p>
<p>這年頭喫飯不容易，聽到見到的，是一片響的關店裁員，於是，識得幾個字的，便靈機一動，糾合幾個同志，租一幢石庫門，來開一個子曰店（一名弄堂小學）混飯喫，這結果，雖然未能豐衣足食，耀祖顯親，但是說得好聽點，「布衣暖，菜根香」却是可以敷衍的。</p>
<p>這一來，一班失業者覺得此中雖無黄金屋，但是還不失一個喫飯的去處，于是你也來我也來的到現在成了「有校皆弄，無弄不校」（弄者，弄堂也）的局面。</p>
<p>同業一多，繼之而起者自然免不得有一番競爭，競爭的方法，最妙的便是拉攏名人來作校董，像戲院子那般的掛出一等紅角兒的牌子來，那樣，又何愁不「生意興隆通四海，財源茂盛達三江」的宣告上下客滿呢。</p>
<p>瞧到此策大爲行得，于是也就費盡心機攢盡門路的掛起紅角兒牌子來，到結果，紅角兒仍不得不掛起免戰牌在報土宣告辭却各校校　戰務，（不久之前　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　）</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>且擯下不表，話　　　想兒一多，紙老虎也就校拆穿，而有的是因爲門路不廣，以致上天無所入地無門的聘不到紅角，於是也祇好鬰鬰地坐他的冷板櫈。</p>
<p>店多雖可成市，但是我們有句老話呌做「貨跑三家不喫虧」，子曰店一多，顧客們自然也要選擇一下「貨色好價錢巧」的起來，這樣一來，有幾家得貼出招盤的紅紙來，那自然也是必然了。</p>
<p>所以，若是一味的用有侮教育的清白和尊嚴一類的話去責難他是無用的，在創業伊始的時候，那個不希望做到價廉物美的地步？那個不想盡一些國民應盡的義務？除了博得自已的生活之外。</p>
<p>在無可奈何中，自然祇好，「笑駡由他笑駡，出盤我自爲之」了，要講禮義廉恥，要講名譽和道德，是先得喫飽了飯的。</p>
<p>如果還有人以爲這樣「教育商業化」，終究未免有些「那個」，那麽，這種冠冕堂皇的話也就算了吧，你瞧，所謂堂堂的大學學院，又那裏不在校舍設備上大吹大擂的「以廣招徠」。</p>
<p>該知道，所謂子曰店的「弄堂小學」，那不過是没辦法的智識失業者的一個不得已的聰明辦法而已。</p>

<h3 id="c262">「少不更事，好運反成歹運」康琪妲蒙的尼格羅的自悔 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>幸運並不一定是好東西，要看你怎樣應用它。應用得好，固然可以一舉成名，但是應用不好，亦可以坐失良機，追悔莫及。即如康琪妲。蒙的尼格羅（Conchitsa　Monlenegro）的遭遇，亦很足以作爲一般幸運兒的借鏡的。她現在已經覺悟到往昔的錯處，而力圖挽救，但是已很費力了。不過她的能够及早覺悟，還不失爲一個聰明人。</p>
<p>她悔過之後的話是：「我的好運，就是我的歹運。我應當受好萊塢的懲罰！」她爲什麽要說這種話？我們且略爲談談她的過去。</p>
<p>總而言之，她成名得太早了，太快了。她的幸運太好了。她少不更事，不知道怎樣應用它，以至好運得而復失。現在已經到了二十一歲，腦筋隨着體格成熟了，才知道以往之非，而思再整旗鼓，掩土重來。她總算是有些天才的，歌舞的天才，所以還能在好萊塢站住了脚，而一步一步的重新爬起來。她現在在福斯公司裏，做着相當重要的角色。但是，她或者已經成了一位大明星了，要是她從前不那樣糊塗的話。</p>
<p>康琪妲蒙的尼格羅是三年以前，米高梅公司由巴黎運到美國來的一位歌舞明星。那時她確已到了明星的地位，她的前途，似乎是很固定的了。但是，那個前途却没有像預期的那樣成爲事實。一步一步的，她的工作漸漸减少了，合同取消而不繼續了。最近，她除掉各處表演舞技之外，祇拍過幾個外國語言的短片子。</p>
<p>康琪妲是一個嬌生慣養的孩子，脾氣是個小姐脾氣，一些不能受委曲的。她生在西班牙的避暑名都，桑西柏斯馨。她的父親是個高級軍官，家中是很富有的。她有一個姊姊，和她從小在修道院裏讀着書。有一次，修道院裏爲當地貧苦兒童，開了一個慈善歌舞表演會，那就是康琪妲一生命運的轉機。康琪妲和她的姊姊跳着舞。等到跳完了，師生家屬交相讚美之聲，把小小的康琪妲弄得樂極而驕起來。</p>
<p>她和她的母親說，她要到巴黎去專習跳舞。當然，她的父母是從來不肯拂逆這位小姑娘的意思的，於是就將她送到巴黎進了一個很有名的歌舞學校。康琪妲是夙賦大才，姿態極美的孩子。所以在十三四歲的時候，她早在巴黎博得藉藉的芳名。她後來又繼續在柏林，倫敦，瑪德里諸名都，登台表演，更是傾倒一時。到了十五歲的時候，她已是名動全歐，到處受人歡迎。米高梅的調查員，就在這個時候，和她訂了合同，請她到美國去演電影。她於是就和她的姊姊，一同到了好萊塢。</p>
<p>米高梅是存着很大的奢望。康琪妲亦存着很大的奢望。她到了好萊塢，就在頂高貴的區域，租了一所華厦，買了大汽車，僱了穿制服的汽車夫，氣派煊赫，紅極一時起來。但是康琪妲現在却惘然地說道：「我那時接受了那許多光榮，在思想上是一些準備都没有的。我因爲傲慢無禮，所以不外就和别人的意思，發生了衝突，處處碰着釘子。有時公司裏叫我頭髮，改一個樣子，我覺得那是一種侮辱。有時我想這樣表演，道演呌我那樣表演，我就自已覺得自已成了人家的奴隸。我不肯聽從勸告。因爲我以前祇聽見過一片恭維頌讚，從來没有受過人家的批評。所以每次遇到了阻碍，我就爭辯，發脾氣。有時竟哭閙起來，因爲我不能自由的去做。</p>
<p>結果，米高梅的當局壓倦了，合同取消了，地位陡然地低落了。她不久覺悟到，如果她要在好萊塢立足，她一定要改去自已的脾氣，一定要和衷共濟，跟人家合作。她立志要在好萊塢存在。雖然她的姊姊已經回西班牙，但是她還不忍放棄昔日噹到的榮名的滋味。她的覺悟是：「成名太早了，太快了。凡是成名太早太快的，應當先將驕矜之心，光呑下肚去，不然是要碰大釘子的！</p>
<h3 id="c263">信不信由你好萊塢的怪事 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>

<p>銷匿已久，現與曼麗畢克馥離異的范朋克氏，他的武俠浪漫作風，素爲海上影迷所愛護，而范氏以愼勉晚節起見，不願生作馮婦，所以他的作品，是欲觀之不可得了。幸而英國倫敦影片公司再三遊說，方纔范氏答應主演「美人心」一劇。刻下該片已經到華，運京檢查，將由「南京」繼「湖山歌舞」而問此，那十九世紀大情人唐璜，他的一生秘史艶跡，經范氏表演於銀幕，當可並垂不朽了。</p>

<p>— 素因</p>
<p>曼麗决意要嫁迭倫了。他們又檢了一個好日子。一切照舊的安排着。人生如夢地又來遭。明天曼麗又要做迭倫杜達夫人了。不過現在她倒覺得有些替傑弗雷可憐起來。她看着傑弗雷坐在她的對面，在她的書齋裏。她低聲地說道：「你跟我生氣嗎？是不是因爲我要嫁迭倫，你所以要也門去嗎？」傑弗雷低着頭！眼睛看着他的紙烟說道：「我眞是一些没有再留在這個地方的理由，所以我還是回西班牙去，但是我却誠意要你們快樂白頭的。」曼麗道：「但是，傑弗雷，是不是……那天你和葆拉來尋找我們的那天，我故的太傻了嗎……」傑弗雷憤然道：「你倒不傻，我太傻了。我自作自受，還有什麽話可說呢？」曼麗道：「那是什麽意思呢？」傑弗雷躊躇了一下，然後說道：「二十年以來，你一心愛着迭倫　，而我又一心愛着你。我不和人家爭，靜等着你自動地和他離開了，然後再告訴你……」他說着，抬起頭來看着曼麗的臉，可是曼麗的眼睛，已經充滿了兩點眼淚了。她哽咽着道：「哦，傑弗雷，你要相信我。我一些都不知道。」傑弗雷道：「當然，你不會知道的。不過到了現在，我祇可以預祝你們前途，快樂無窮了。曼麗道：「那你放心好了。我嫁了迭倫，一定會快樂的。他是小心體貼的人。他就是給當我上的那天，還没有忘記送了許多玉米花來哩。」</p>
<p>這個時候。歇伯走了進來說道：「傑弗雷時候到了。船都要開了。」傑弗雷站了起來。曼麗亦站了起來，和他略爲吻了一吻。傑弗雷走了出去，頭都不回一回。歇伯故意走在後面，等到傑弗雷走了出去，他對曼麗說道：「這是你應當知道的，玉米花是傑弗雷送你的，不是迭倫送的。」他說着亦走了。</p>
<p>他們都走了。曼麗一個人站在屋子中間，雙手握着拳頭。玉米花，原來是他送的。傑弗雷，那個深思熟，慮一本正經的傑弗雷。她又想起了小時候的事，傑弗雷待她那麽體貼温柔，她不覺一陣心酸起來。她這才知道，她心愛的人是傑弗雷，祇有傑弗雷。她於是奔到花園裏，尋到了迭倫，氣急嘘嘘地問他道：「你怎麽辦，倘使我亦像你一樣，將尩個人擲在禮拜堂裏？」迭倫起初不知道她是認眞的，他笑着道：「誰替你出的主意，問我這種話？伊琳諾爾？」可是曼麗道：「迭倫……我是和你說正經話！」迭倫道：「我亦是說正經話。我們明天來如法泡製一下。我一早就到禮拜堂裏去。你到老晚的來。等到差不多大家……曼麗喊道：「這不是講笑話的時候。我祇問你，你怎麽辦？」迭倫一看神氣不對。這是要他思想了。怎麽回答的好？他一時回答不也來，祇說了一聲：「我怎麽告訴我的朋友們呢？」曼麗聽了，不覺喊了一聲：「什麽？」她就一時啼笑皆作起來。迭倫忍不住了，亦高聲喊道：「曼麗，你怎麽啦？這是你羞辱我！你不能那樣對待我的！我吃不下去的！」曼麗哭着道：「哦，你知道吃不下去的！你快想一個方法吃它下去吧！去砍森頭去…………我得到了無限的好處。你可以學學游水，騎馬。要不然的話，哭到你睡着了爲止。你自已去想吧！我不幹了！」</p>
<p>她自已掩住了自已的口向外狂奔着。迭倫在後面追着喊着，她亦没有聽見。她一直奔到碼頭上，尋着了傑弗雷。傑弗雷板着面孔，一絲笑容都没有的問她道：「你來作什麽？」曼麗道：「没有什麽事…………不過我聽說西班牙在春天，是再美麗没有的了。」傑弗雷道：「不錯的。」曼麗掉轉身來，拉住了傑弗雷的衣襟，露着誠惶恐的神氣問道：「像我這樣的傻子，他們會不會放我上岸的？」傑弗雷怎麽回答她的話，你們自已去猜吧！（完）</p>

<h3 id="e7">Yue Kai-xian's Telegram Stated That the Situation Is Not Expected to Escalate <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A portion of the puppet Rehe army, Zhang Junzhe's brigade and Peng Jinsheng's brigade, approximately over three thousand cavalry and infantry, arrived at Datang, Fengning County, on the Chahar border. This army was transferred from the Weichang and Luanping counties and is under the command of Japanese training officers and brigade adjutants. They are awaiting orders in the area. Over a thousand troops from Li Shouxin's puppet Rehe Garrison Brigade have gathered within the territory of the third and fourth districts of Guyuan, with the majority being transported forward from Duolun. The situation in East Chahar is tense. However, the outposts of both sides are still forty li apart and have not made contact. Lieutenant Colonel Matsui, the Japanese Kwantung Army military attache stationed in Zhangjiakou, flew back to Zhangyuan from Changchun on the 19th, carrying orders from his superiors to convey to the Chahar authorities. Although Chahar Province Chairman Song Zheyuan is in Beiping, he has telegraphed orders to all his troops to remain calm and firmly defend their positions. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yue Kai-xian met with Matsui, the Japanese military attache stationed in Zhangjiakou, to discuss the East Chahar matter. He telegraphed Beiping today, reporting that he had met with Matsui and that the East Chahar incident is not expected to escalate. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the East Chahar issue arose, the diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in Beiping have paid close attention. Foreign newspaper reporters stationed in Beiping have all received telegrams instructing them to immediately rush to the area to investigate the truth. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Beiping received a report from East Chahar this morning stating that besides a small number of puppet troops stationed in the Datang area, which is twenty li from Guyuan, there are only four Japanese individuals staying there. The rumor that there are three thousand Japanese and puppet troops is not factual. Over two thousand cavalry from Zhang Haipeng's puppet army are currently stationed in Chengde. In the areas of Changliang, Wunihu, South Shizhuzi, North Shizhuzi, and Shidaogou in East Chahar, the total number of our local militia is no more than two hundred. Regular troops of the 29th Army have not been stationed in the area. Although Japanese and puppet troops have occasionally scattered leaflets and slogans in the area in recent days, claiming that they will begin military action, there has been no contact. Our authorities have only ordered the front lines to maintain strict defense and not to act rashly, maintaining a very calm attitude. At the same time, both Chinese and Japanese authorities believe that it is a local incident and not a major problem. It is currently being negotiated by Matsui, the Japanese military attache stationed in Zhangyuan, and Yue Kaixian, the special diplomatic envoy of Chahar Province. Song Zheyuan's return to Chahar has not yet been determined. Yue Kai-xian came to Beiping from Zhangyuan yesterday afternoon to report to Song Zheyuan on the recent situation in East Chahar and to attend last night's banquet held by Song Zheyuan for the Japanese military attache Takahashi Tan.

If the provinces issue too many public bonds, they cannot be sold and can only be mortgaged, resulting in great losses, and the burden on the people will increase significantly. In the long run, this is not a normal financial practice. Now that the central and local governments are defining their responsibilities, there should be a method of adjustment under certain normal financial practices.

Following this precedent, a detailed opinion will be presented to the Central Political Council to decide on principles first, and then the Ministry of Finance will consult with the authorities of various provinces at length so that this year's local finances can gradually get on the right track.

However, the repayment of old debts and interest is too large, so we can only勉付子息, and we are still unable to use the surplus to expand business. In the past, in order to expand long-distance routes, we planned to raise 10 million in shipping industry bonds, which is still under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Council. After careful discussion, we plan to issue it to add new ships, because the Nanyang route requires new ships to open up. The shipping industry cooperation association has been established, and the shipping industry will be more stable than the current free competition in the future, and the occurrence of dangerous accidents in adventurous voyages can be reduced. The result of free competition is that each route used to require the deployment of ten ships to and from each other. Now, due to the lack of restrictions, it has increased to more than ten ships, which is not in accordance with economic principles and leads to losses. In addition, due to greedy loading exceeding the deadweight tonnage, sinking has occurred. Now, each route is equipped according to the needs of passengers and cargo, and the remaining ships are repaired and new routes are opened up. Cooperation is the most important condition for alleviating the current economic downturn in various industries, and it is also the newest method of this century. Finally, it is said that all the stocks have been repurchased, and what remains is probably only the lost part. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Over the past year, the European continent has accumulated various dangerous materials. If not handled carefully, they could trigger a global upheaval. Issues such as Austria's independence, the deteriorating relations between Italy and Southern Europe, and the confrontation between France and Germany all contain the crisis of war. Once erupted, they would have broad global implications. In the Pacific, since Japan unilaterally declared the abolition of the naval treaty, the arms race between the United States and Japan and the various disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union have intensified. How the future will unfold is hard to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this year, after the French Foreign Minister visited Rome, France and Italy reached an understanding. France made concessions to Italy in Tunisia and ceded 80,000 square miles of North African territory to Italy. At the same time, it also recognized joint management with Italy of railways in its布基.阿基.阿白巴. Moreover, the exchange obtained is primarily a Central European peace treaty, linking Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and other countries into one entity, to be jointly negotiated by France and Italy to ensure Austria's independence. In other words, it is a renewed formation of an alliance surrounding Germany. This can be described as a special gain in diplomacy outside of conferences, and also a sign of a turning point in the global situation.</p>
<p>As for the crisis in Western Europe, the Saar issue is the most likely to trigger a major change. France also knows that争彼区区administrative power benefits France very little. It only causes displeasure for both Britain and Italy and easily provokes opposition from the Germans. The wisest countermeasure is to follow the results of local people's votes to determine who the administrative power belongs to. Moreover, France still retains the right to coal and iron ore deposits in the Saar mining area. Germany must prepare 300 million to 400 million gold francs as the price to acquire the mining rights. It is not without benefit to France. Therefore, France treats the Saar vote calmly and without any difficulties. Germany can also slightly ease its resentment and may be able to return to the League of Nations to engage in compromise at the conference table and return to peace. This matter is not only that France can take the overall situation into consideration, but also that Britain is working hard. According to the国民社 on the 19th, the Lord Privy Seal of the United Kingdom, Eden, delivered a speech on the Saar vote, saying, "Britain's policy towards Europe is only to seek a deeper friendship with neighboring countries. The resolution of this Saar vote allows us to hope that a new era of compromise has begun. If all countries want to go further, take advantage of the opportunity to achieve concrete results, they should cooperate and not just talk. In order to ensure Europe once and for all, we will cooperate more closely in the coming months. This is the key to maintaining lasting peace." From this speech, it can be seen that the European situation has prospects for improvement.</p>
<p>Since the end of last year, the United States has been agitated by the Pacific tide and deeply feels that international problems are not easy to deal with. Therefore, it has decided to join the International Court of Justice. Judging from the current international situation, this move may not have any effect, but for the United States, in this era of evolution, it is difficult to stick to its views and refuse to be imprisoned. The United States' joining the International Court of Justice has added a lot of luster to the League of Nations. After the preliminary meeting on naval reduction formed a deadlock, Britain and the United States gradually approached each other and jointly advocated their actual shipbuilding power in order to establish an appropriate arms reduction treaty before 1936. If there are no unexpected obstacles, this de facto understanding of naval reduction can be formed. Then, there is also a glimmer of hope for peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>However, this kind of understanding on arms reduction is only limited to a part of the scope of arms reduction. There are many hidden reefs in other overall political issues. To remove these obstacles, the first requirement is that strong countries in the Far East can deeply realize the necessity of maintaining peace and that the policy of aggression is not suitable for today's world. Only then can there be hope for peace. Otherwise, although the European situation has seen a relaxation, and the League of Nations has increased its strength due to the accession of the Soviet Union, the understanding between Italy and France, and the expression of goodwill from the United States, what methods can be used to deal with the Far East?</p>
<h3 id="e42">Three Uninhabited Pacific Islands Transferred to US Navy Department for Management <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The reason is unknown, or a flight training ground may be built.</p>
<p>No contact has been made on the issue of Japanese-administered islands.</p>
<p>(Washington) Three uninhabited islands in the Pacific Ocean were transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the US Navy Department today. The reasons have not been announced. These three islands are quite close to Hawaii: Wake Island, Kingman Reef, and Johnston Atoll. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, with the special permission of Congress, today transferred Wake Island, Kingman Reef, Johnston Island, and Sand Island (except for Wake Island, the other three islands belong to the Hawaiian Islands) to the jurisdiction of the Navy Department. It is learned that this move is in preparation to temporarily use Wake Island as a Pacific airfield for the planned Sino-US Pacific aviation. (19th国民电)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt announced today the transfer of Wake and other islands to the jurisdiction of the Navy Department. At the same time, the press also asked Secretary of State Hull about the US attitude regarding the fact that the League of Nations Administrative Council still recognized the Pacific trust islands as being under Japanese rule. He replied that the United States had not exchanged views with any country on this matter and that the government had no opinion to express on the actions of the League of Nations Administrative Council at this time. It is generally believed that the United States is temporarily unwilling to intervene in this matter, but still retains the right to jointly deal with the Pacific trust islands as stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. According to what the Secretary of State said, this statement has been confirmed. (19th国民电)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Committee on Mandates issued a report on the meeting of the Committee in October and November of last year on the 4th of this month, stating that Japan had spent huge sums of money building ports in the Pacific mandate islands, which was not commensurate with the commercial needs there. This report has recently been passed by the League of Nations Administrative Council, but it did not mention Japan or the issue of the Pacific mandate islands after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. It is generally recognized that after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations in March of this year, Japan will continue to occupy the mandate islands. However, this is inevitable and not due to the decision of the League of Nations Administrative Council. (19th哈瓦斯电)</p>
<h3 id="e43">New Army Aviation Regulations in the US <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Army Department today promulgated newly revised Army Aviation Regulations. If strictly enforced, the days when general aviation officers sit comfortably in swivel chairs and never take off will soon be over. According to the newly revised regulations, all aviation personnel with more than fifteen years of service must prove their flying ability every year in order to continue serving in the aviation team. And they must fly at least one hundred hours in various weather conditions each year. If they fail the annual exam or do not have enough flying time, they must be transferred back to the ground force to serve. Observers familiar with the aviation situation believe that this regulation will greatly help both the effectiveness and morale of the aviation team. The officials at all levels of the aviation team have long been unable to fly. It is recalled that General Mitchell of the aviation team also advocated this plan many years ago. However, after he exposed the corruption of the aviation personnel, he was squeezed out by his colleagues, and even allowed to choose between resigning or being suspended for five years. At that time, Mitchell resigned on his own. However, attacks on the lack of effectiveness of the aviation team have not stopped. Moreover, this move by the Army Department is in line with the attitude of President Roosevelt and his government advisors, who advocate that the Army Department's grade-by-grade promotion system should be abolished, and that the Army should learn from the Navy to improve its effectiveness.

<h3 id="e44">US Senator Advocates Silver Standard <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Congressman Dai Martin said in an interview with the Associated Press today that he supports the single silver standard and that the old Spanish silver dollar, containing 412.5 英釐 of silver, should be the unit of currency. Dai also said that this measure would be the most effective way to raise prices and reduce the burden of debt, and that a future international bimetallic standard would be feasible. Dai believes that the instability of international exchange rates can be avoided because the Ministry of Finance can still store huge amounts of cash to regulate exchange rates. Now he will propose that exports and agricultural products can be given price premiums with silver, and he has strongly urged the Ministry of Finance to continue its silver purchase plan, while trying to reconcile the conflicting interests of China and the United States. Dai continued, "Gold is no longer sufficient as a medium of exchange, and its main use is only for clearing international differences and for storage. Since we currently have no gold standard, I propose a silver standard. The value of the dollar remains the same. In this way, we can use silver as the standard and gold as the reserve, and credit can be stabilized accordingly. International commercial competition will make other countries accept this standard. Moreover, this move is not expansion, but just a change of standard. Prices do not have to risk issuing paper money to be raised. In fact, we have abolished the gold standard, but all prices in the United States are still based on gold dollars. If they are changed to silver coins, all debts can be easily cleared, and other countries' debts to the United States can also be easily repaid." Dai believes that if the world's existing gold reserves can be distributed evenly and all man-made trade barriers are removed, then maintaining the gold standard is also possible. However, gold-holding countries are determined not to redistribute, and lending is also difficult under the current circumstances. There are no difficulties in the distribution of silver, because the world's silver reserves are twelve times more than gold, and the amount of silver produced annually can still be increased. Therefore, Dai believes that if the Supreme Court does not allow the revocation of the "gold payment clause", the United States will have to collect silver at a premium, or allow foreign merchants to enjoy a 40% advantage over US importers and exporters.

<p>(Washington) Today, the nine justices of the Supreme Court held an informal meeting in a secret room of Congress to negotiate the judgment on the lawsuit filed by Norman against the government. Therefore, Roosevelt's monetary policy of abolishing the 1933 gold clause is in danger of being shaken. The court may decide on an opinion on Monday of next week, and then write an opinion. It is expected that a final decision will not be made before February 4. The question to be decided now is whether the government's suspension of the gold payment clause is constitutional. If the court's ruling is unfavorable to the government, then the government's payment of bonds worth 169,000,000,000 yuan with the currently devalued US dollar will be significantly affected.

<p>Billions of pounds of current assets are idle</p>
<p>Millions of people are unemployed</p>
<p>(London) Former British wartime Prime Minister Lloyd George delivered his second speech today in Baoxi里 on a new plan to alleviate the economic difficulties of Britain. There were many listeners, saying that Britain is real. The machines are rusty and urgently need to be wiped and lubricated to make them operate smoothly. George repeatedly stated that his proposals were completely non-partisan. What he seeks is more efficient industry, more fertile soil, happier families and a more equal distribution of human happiness. Now, no less than billions of pounds of current assets are idled in banks and do not circulate, and millions of people are wandering the streets without work. We should pay attention to this and remedy the country's shortcomings. If we do so, Britain will be encouraged by the vision and measures of its rulers. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Eastern European Pact Negotiations <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Progress in Russo-Polish Contact</p>
<p>(Geneva) A representative of a semi-official French news agency visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck this afternoon. Beck was lying in his room with bronchitis. He then visited Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. It is said that the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact only needs Germany's approval to be completed. Litvinov's words seemed to imply that Beck, who has always opposed this treaty, has now changed his attitude. However, according to today's Polish government organ, Beck's approval is conditional on Germany joining the treaty. It is the general opinion that even a conditional joining by Poland is a major step towards realizing this great plan, which Russia and France are now paying great attention to. This move will also facilitate the negotiations between French Prime Minister Françoise and Foreign Minister赖伐尔 and British authorities in London at the end of this month. The future negotiations in London will take the opportunity to discuss a broad basis that can be used to discuss various major European issues. It is said that this meeting may be the beginning of various conferences where European politicians attempt to resolve major outstanding issues. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov recently issued a statement to the Havas News Agency, stating the results of this Geneva conversation, saying, "The hope for the establishment of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact has now greatly increased. Whether this pact can be signed depends solely on Germany. In any case, the value of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact is immeasurable and will become the key to all diplomatic negotiations in the future." Litvinov expressed satisfaction with the conversation with French Foreign Minister at Geneva this time, saying that had repeatedly assured that the spirit of the protocol signed by France and Russia in Geneva on December 5 last year should always be adhered to.

<p>Foreign Minister Simon Will Issue a Declaration</p>
<p>(London) According to the Observer, Foreign Minister Simon will issue a formal declaration when French Prime Minister Françoise and Foreign Minister visit England, endorsing the provisions of the Rome Agreement on the Austrian issue. (20th哈瓦斯电)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Rome Agreement signed between Italy and France on the 7th of this month contains a document suggesting that all neighboring countries of Austria and Austria should sign another agreement. When Austria's independence is threatened, they should consult with Austria. The signatory countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of Central European countries. Whether the four Balkan Pact countries will join this agreement is currently being discussed by representatives of the respective countries here. Although no decision has been made, we dare to say that since the Rome Agreement does not explicitly state that the four Balkan countries should join the agreement, the countries are now trying to create a security network similar to the Rome Agreement, which is certainly credible.

<p>Place Europe in a Realm of Lasting Peace</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Lord Privy Seal Eden delivered a broadcast speech on the Saar vote, saying, "Britain's policy towards Europe is only to seek a deeper friendship with neighboring countries. The resolution of this Saar vote allows us to hope that a new era of compromise has begun. If all countries want to go further, take advantage of the opportunity to achieve concrete results, they should cooperate and not just talk. For the sake of Europe once and for all, all countries should cooperate closely in the coming months, as this is the key to maintaining lasting peace." (19th国民电)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berliner Tageblatt refuted the claims in French newspapers that a large number of residents were fleeing the Saar region, saying that the so-called number of migrants reaching 20,000 to 45,000 was exaggerated. According to recent reports, only more than 700 residents of the Saar have left the Saar for France so far, which can be divided into two parts. One part is those who went to the Saar to seek jobs from the诺克斯 or the separatist faction, and the rest are only a few thousand people. The newspaper also said that the reason why France is 悻悻 is that these people will have no place to settle after arriving in France. However, when they were in the Saar, they only served France. It is inappropriate for France to say that they should be responsible by the League of Nations because they voted to maintain the status quo. But who is responsible has nothing to do with Germany. (19th国民电)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Will Germany's foreign policy change due to the return of the Saar region? This question is quite interesting. Since the results of the plebiscite were announced, people from all walks of life in Berlin were full of optimism, and Hitler, "Leader and Chancellor," gave a radio speech on the day of the announcement, saying that Germany no longer had any territorial demands on France. After this statement, the optimistic mood became even more certain. However, the German media has repeatedly demonstrated against France and the League of Nations, and their rhetoric has become impatient. In addition, after Hitler delivered two important speeches, the optimism of the general public had to be greatly reduced. In short, Germany's position was revealed by Hitler tomorrow. The saying that territorial demands were given up has been around since the Treaty of Locarno was signed and is not a new political factor. Hitler's meaning is that Germany's concessions have stopped here, and other countries cannot make any more demands. If so, then what he said earlier was only to create an atmosphere, and it cannot be regarded as a concrete embodiment of Germany's future foreign policy. For the sake of the stability of the European situation, it would be very beneficial if Germany could return to Geneva. However, Hitler seems to have indicated that various disarmament restrictions are rejected in principle. If Germany wants to adopt diplomatic promises, the only condition is to clearly recognize Germany's rearmament as legal, which is a pity. As for Germany's position on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, it has now clearly changed. Hitler's declaration contained the only concrete proposal, that he was prepared to sign a non-aggression treaty with France, which was no different from the one Germany signed with Poland on January 26 last year. Mr. Hitler also declared clearly that he was not very interested in the League of Nations. This is also reflected in Berlin, where the current situation is beneficial to Germany and does no harm. Germany can actually recognize that it is not bound by the Treaty of Versailles and actively rearm itself. This is to express the honor and equal rights of the German nation. (19th哈瓦斯电)</p>

<p>Newspapers Begin to Criticize Lithuania</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since the Saar issue was resolved, Germany's vision has shifted to the east, as evidenced by the recent criticism by some German newspapers of Lithuania's deployment of troops in Memel. Lithuanian newspapers were not willing to remain silent and also spoke out in reply, saying that East Prussia is now more militarized than any part of Germany. Today, German District leader枚發表 published an editorial criticizing Lithuania's "ridiculous accusations" and said that a plebiscite may be held in Memel, and if so, the result will be the same as in the Saar. Memel has an area of 943 square miles and a population of 146,000. The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany should cede the area and hand it over to the management of the Ambassador Conference. On February 16, 1923, it was incorporated into Lithuanian territory. According to the Memel Convention signed by Lithuania and countries such as Britain, France, Italy, and Japan in 1924, Memel is a unit under Lithuanian sovereignty and enjoys a large degree of local autonomy.

<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon at 1 PM, the National Political Party held a convention at the Ueno Seiyōken. Judge Ōasa recommended and elected Machida, the Secretary-General, as the President of the National Political Party. Mr. Sakurauchi reported on the process of earnestly requesting Chairman Machida to assume the presidency. The new President Machida gave an impromptu speech, followed by a speech by Tomita Kōjirō on behalf of the party members. Former President Wakatsuki delivered a speech, after which Raimaki Keikichi gave a thank-you speech to the former president. Subsequently, new staff and declarations were decided. Finally, the new President Machida delivered a speech and the meeting adjourned. The inaugural speech of the new President Machida is as follows: When President Wakatsuki resigned, based on the resolution of the joint meeting of party members and councilors, President Wakatsuki designated a successor. Although I firmly declined, the party's situation could not allow for a prolonged vacancy in the presidency. After the persistent requests of the former president, executives, and party members, I reluctantly accepted this difficult task. I earnestly request the assistance of all party members. Although our party has been a minority party in recent years, it has gained trust, entirely due to the appropriate handling by the former president. Therefore, I deeply appreciate his achievements during his tenure. However, my talent is limited, and my knowledge is shallow. I hope for guidance and encouragement from senior members. Therefore, I plan to recommend Wakatsuki, Yamamoto, Taketomi Tokitoshi, and Katō Masayoshi as Supreme Advisors. The new staff is as follows: Secretaries-General: Ōta Masahiro, Ogawa Gōtarō, Ōasa Tadao, Katsuta Eikichi, Raimaki Keikichi (Chief Secretary), Taketomi Watanabe, Tanaka Takeo, Nakajima Yadanji, Umezawa Uyahachi, Uchisaki Sakuzaburō.

<p>(Tokyo) The third round of detailed negotiations regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway this year has been ongoing since the 17th. From 4 PM on the 19th, Tōgō, the Director of the Eurasian Bureau, and Representative Kaslovsky met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs until 11:30 PM, discussing for over seven hours. They discussed the unresolved issues from the previous meeting, such as the price determination and the insertion of arbitration clauses in case of contract breach, as well as the calculation method for the payment of pensions to bureau staff and all other issues. Both sides engaged in enthusiastic negotiations. As a result of the above discussions, a complete consensus has not yet been reached regarding the insertion of arbitration clauses. As for other details, some technical considerations still remain. However, the main points of the transfer negotiations have largely reached agreement between the two sides. The representatives will meet with Director Tōgō again next Monday or Tuesday, at which time the issues should be resolved. The negotiations on the 19th have virtually concluded the details. If progress continues smoothly, a committee to draft the agreement documents can be established within the next week. The drafting of these clauses will take about a month. It is estimated that the signing of the agreement will take place in early March. (20th, Nichen Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Spanish Aviator Plans to Explore the Stratosphere <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Madrid: Major Emilio Herrera, a famous Spanish aviator, will conduct an unprecedented exploration of the stratosphere in early February. The equipment used for this ascent will be an ordinary balloon and an open gondola. Major Herrera enjoys a long-standing reputation in the aviation world and is a frequent passenger on Zeppelins. He also has a considerable position in the scientific community. This daring adventure is worthy of worldwide attention. Herrera has been preparing tirelessly for the past eighteen months. The balloon used for the ascent has a hydrogen capacity of 1,600 cubic meters. At its highest altitude, its diameter will be 36 meters. The most important part of the balloon, which is related to the success of the trip, is the balloon box. This box was custom-made in Germany. The remaining parts, including the gondola, were specially manufactured by the Guadarrama military aircraft factory near the Spanish capital. Previous stratosphere explorations have all used sealed golden gondolas to carry people, isolating the internal and external air. However, the current gondola is open, so preparations must be meticulous and thorough. It is reported that Herrera will use a self-heated electric swimming suit to maintain body temperature. Inside the swimming suit, he will wear a specially made object made of steel wire, which is extremely strong. Inside this object, he will then wear two special sets of underwear, one made of rubber, which is waterproof, and one made of wool. In addition, there will be an oxygen tank for breathing en route. Currently, Herrera is practicing navigation at the Madrid Industrial School every day. The school has prepared a special test chamber, where the temperature is constantly at 60 degrees Celsius or 66 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, which is the estimated temperature at an altitude of 20,000 meters. The suitability of the clothes and equipment will be determined in this test chamber. Herrera estimates that ascent and descent will each take two hours. A small compartment will be used for high-altitude observation. The planned altitude is 23,000 meters. If this altitude can be reached, all previous records will be broken. Professor Picard of Belgium's highest record is 16,200 meters. Later, American scientists ascended to 18,665 meters. Soviet scientists ascended to 22,000 meters. However, the Soviet scientists did not survive. Herrera plans to ascend alone. However, his wife does not want her husband to risk such a great danger alone and asked to accompany him. However, Herrera said that adding one person to the balloon would reduce the altitude by at least 1,000 meters, so he does not want her to go. Herrera will carry a short-wave radio transmitter with him to report observations at any time en route. The most interesting aspect of this ascent is that when the balloon reaches an altitude of 20,000 meters, the entire Iberian Peninsula will be visible at once.

<p>First, Archduke Eugen Becomes President</p>
<p>The Second Step is to Restore the Imperial System</p>
<p>(Vienna) Rumors of the restoration of the Austrian Imperial family have been circulating for a long time. Now, it is learned that there are concrete steps being taken, and the realization of this is approaching. Last night, a meeting was held here, passing a proposal to appoint Archduke Eugen as President of Austria. The term of the current Austrian President Miklas expires in January of this year, at which time Archduke Eugen will succeed him as President. This proposal was formed after a cabinet meeting. Political circles point to this as the initial step towards the restoration of the Austrian Imperial family. Previously, it was extremely confidential. Further reports on this matter are difficult to obtain. Archduke Eugen is currently an exile living in Basel and is a cousin of the Duke of Vaud. The current Austrian constitution does not allow members of the Imperial family to be president, but this clause can be easily amended. After Archduke Eugen becomes president, the second step will be the restoration of the imperial system. (20th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Progress in European Rural Areas <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin Correspondence) Since the Great War, all industries in Europe have been devastated, especially in Germany. However, Germany has returned to normal in the shortest possible time. The issue of rural revival is another serious event in Europe. The reporter interviewed Dr. Winter, the leading cadre of the German National Food Office, to inquire about the rural issues in Europe. I was granted an interview. A record of his conversation is as follows:</p>
<p>At present, the desire of all countries in the world to revive world trade is becoming stronger, while at the same time, the restrictions on international commodity transactions are also becoming increasingly strict. It seems that people do not pay deep attention to this. The solution to this difficulty is the new German land distribution policy. We must first study the concept of European farmers. What exactly is it? In fact, the European countries are economically and internationally interdependent. Under this kind of situation, only by jointly cooperating to use the advantages of each nation to obtain profits can the state of their poverty be slightly reduced. This is indeed an economic problem of increasing national consumption capacity.</p>
<p>Europe has no new strategies for the farmers themselves. The old ideas, such as when the British Minister of Agriculture, Cromwell (a leader of the Republican Party), initiated the World Colonial Council, were extinguished after the French Revolution. At that time, economic competition was the beginning of general market hostility, and the fact that rural areas were the foundation of the economy was forgotten and no longer considered. Today, when we consider it carefully, we know that it was a mistake. For example, it was unbelievable to people at that time that the US President would intervene in wheat matters not long ago. Therefore, it is clear that directly resolving economic problems is impossible. Today, the thinking of European farmers is in the process of revival. The basis of its new thinking is the German government's agricultural land policy. Farmers must first have firmness and security in order to generate basic concepts.</p>
<p>German leader Hitler and Minister of Agriculture Ganli have formulated laws on agricultural product markets in order to achieve this goal. These laws are not only implemented in one's own country, but can also be used in trade between countries, because the true nature of commodity transactions should be in firmness and not speculation, which leads to fluctuations. Farmers are very clear about this point.</p>
<p>The goal of the German market laws is not limited to one's own country, and the German Ministry of Agriculture can thereby improve the living standards and consumption capacity of European farmers. European industry will also gradually become vibrant because of this. The formulation of these economic laws is not only implemented on Germany's agricultural product imports, but also equally applied to Germany's exports to European countries.</p>
<p>Europe's concept of farmers arises from the assumption that European countries still have unlimited purchasing potential. This concept has now become a reality. The goal of Germany's commercial policy is to "increase trade mutual assistance." Generally speaking, this plan can only be successful on the basis of the new land distribution law. The market law is sufficient to control foreign imports and protect domestic production prices from the impact of commodity imports. Regarding agricultural products, the government has established agencies to manage all imports and ensure the stability of imported commodities. At present, the Netherlands and Denmark, Hungary and Switzerland, Finland and Yugoslavia, have all formed commercial treaties based on this. The success of this farmer-to-farmer treaty has also made Europe's thinking on farmers a reality. In the next few years, it will not be a problem for Europe to conclude such trade treaties internationally. Germany is very satisfied with the implementation of the above policies. Its success in increasing imports and agricultural products will be enough to make all countries recognize Germany as a loyal customer. (Guomin News Agency)</p>

<p>The Truth About the National Food Corporation</p>
<p>Strengthening Dictatorial Agricultural Policies</p>
<p>"More important than anything else is the great integration of the economy, that is, the integration of a production sector within the entire German economy." This is what Dr. Wattadaler, the Minister of Food, said. His main idea is to unite agricultural workers, landlords, etc., to form large cartels and trusts similar to various organizations in industry. He believes that a cartel of agricultural products can definitely be realized. This is also because of Germany's current economic difficulties. Export trade cannot move forward, and there are no colonial markets for development, so it is necessary to find ways to develop the domestic market and break through towards a controlled economy. Since September 1933, the National Socialist Party has been working to realize its ideal of controlling agriculture. The first step was to organize the "National Food Corporation." This organization, with Food Minister Dahle as its supreme leader, forcibly included all agricultural entrepreneurs, owner-farmers, tenant farmers, farm laborers, rural cooperatives, merchants selling agricultural products, agricultural product processors, etc. Members of the National Food Corporation must absolutely obey the leadership of their leaders, otherwise they will be severely punished. As for those involved in guiding policies, they are large landlords, large agricultural capitalists, or large wholesalers related to agricultural products. Therefore, the power of the Food Minister has increased, and the power of influential figures in agriculture in general has also increased. This is very similar to the cartels in industry.</p>
<p>The law on controlling grains was promulgated in September 1933. First, the Minister of Food has the power to control the production price and the sales price of grains. According to this law, the Minister of Food can determine the market price of wheat and rye. This is what grain producers must abide by when they first take grains to the market for sale. He divides the entire Germany into nine districts, each with price differences based on its geographical conditions, and gradually increases the prices. By June of this year, the wheat price had increased by 12% and the rye price had increased by 7%. No other prices are allowed for market transactions outside of these prices, and speculative transactions such as forward trading are not allowed. If such transactions are made, the government will impose severe penalties. Second, the Minister of Food has the power to order the combination of flour companies and may prohibit them from new equipment and expansion of the business. According to this law, an economic union of wheat and rye is organized with all flour mills in Germany as members. The main tasks of the union are: (1) to limit the expansion of existing production equipment, and (2) to order each operator to produce in proportion based on the average production volume.</p>
<p>Understanding the above situation, we can know that the main purpose of its control is: first, to maintain the price of wheat, and second, to limit the supply of flour, maintain the price of flour, so that this industrial sector of Germany is not agitated by market trends, and the people's food source is also more stably guaranteed.</p>
<p>After June 1934, due to the control of grains, the power of the Minister of Food exceeded the original power. He can control the sales methods and the quantity of sales of grains, and can also control the purchase of raw materials and the sale of manufactured products by grain merchants, flour enterprises, etc. In other words, the Minister has the right to decide the amount of flour produced by flour mills and the amount of bread produced by bakeries. Therefore, the grain price determined by the Minister of Food in the second half of this year is very different from the price determined at the same time last year. Last year, the price determined was the minimum price, and this year it is a buying and selling price. There is not much profit for the merchants in between. Now the whole Germany is divided into nineteen districts, and each district has organized a "Grain Economic Group." These economic groups are united to form the "German Grain Economic Central Union." The union directs the local areas, and the Minister of Food is in the position of supervisor.</p>
<p>Not only grains, but also milk and other agricultural products are organized in a similar way to establish the local economic groups and central alliances to determine sales areas and market prices. The situation of agricultural control in Germany is roughly like this. (December 20 in Berlin)</p>

<p>Wanting to Force Song's Troops to Retreat to the West of the Great Wall Line</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: There have been many rumors about the Chahar East issue recently. On the 18th and 19th, telegrams that stimulate people's hearts came from Tokyo and Changchun, which proves the unstable state of the situation in eastern Chahar. On the 18th, according to a foreign merchant in Beiping who received a telegram from Tokyo, the Chahar East incident is inevitable according to news from Shenyang. The Chengde Japanese Army Department hopes that Song Zheyuan's Chinese troops stationed in Guyuan will retreat to the west of the Great Wall Line, and will take appropriate measures, etc. After hearing the news, the diplomatic circles in Beiping paid close attention to the future changes of the issue. On the 19th, according to the Changchun telegram issued by the Japanese communication agencies, the Japanese Kwantung Army Department openly stated that the Changliang, Wuni River, North Shizhuzi, South Shizhuzi, Yong'anbao, and Sidaogou areas of Chahar Province belong to the Fengning County of Jehol Province, and will recover them through military action, etc. The reporter specially visited a member of the Chahar Provincial Government to inquire about the truth. According to him, the Japanese and puppet troops' activities towards Changliang and Wuni River were unexpected. It is found that Changliang, Wuni River, North Shizhuzi, South Shizhuzi, Yong'anbao, and Sidaogou originally belonged to Zhanyuan County of Chahar Province. The boundaries recorded in Chinese and foreign maps are very clear, and there are no stationed troops in the above-mentioned areas, only local militias maintain law and order. At a time when Sino-Japanese relations are improving, the Japanese army stationed in Jehol suddenly stated that the above-mentioned areas are under the jurisdiction of Fengning County, Jehol Province, and will take military action, which is very regrettable, etc. According to unofficial news, the two sides are currently in contact to resolve the issue peacefully. The location seems to be in Zhangjiakou. Qin Dechun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Chahar Provincial Government, went to Zhangyuan on the 18th, and it is said that he was handling this matter. Takahashi Tan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, also told foreign reporters who visited him on the morning of the 19th that he is currently working hard to mediate the issue in order to prevent the situation from escalating. Zong Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar, and Xiao Zhenying, member of the committee, visited He Yingqin twice on the 19th to discuss the matter. It is reported that the main force of the Japanese army in Chengde is now concentrated in Fengning County, Jehol Province, and the number of people is unknown. The vanguard troops are stationed in the Datang area of Chahar Province, with about 3,000 puppet troops of Zhang Haipeng's troops, and more than 1,000 Japanese troops behind them. Judging from the above situation, the situation in eastern Chahar has become very serious. (19th)</p>

Rubbings or photographs are not enough for people in other countries to observe and study. It still ordered the original bronze vessels to be sent to Beijing. After receiving the order, the Department of Education discussed with Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library. There are a total of thirteen bronze vessels, which were originally a complete set of sacrificial vessels for the ancients, so most of the vessels are in pairs. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, it is proposed to select one of each pair to send, for a total of seven vessels, including Ding, Dun, Pan, Bi, Hu, Lei, and Li, etc. They will be properly packed and shipped in the near future. The remaining Han portrait stone carvings, Qin bricks, and Han tiles with inscriptions will each be sent with rubbings.</p>

<p>Goods from a Certain Country are Sold in Large Quantities in the Interior</p>
<p>Traitors Take Advantage of the Tiger's威to Join the Nationality of a Certain Country</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: A certain country's management of the invasion of Shantou City has become more active recently. Its latest strategy focuses more on the commercial aspect, but military invasion actions are not relaxed in the slightest. For example, in the past month, warships of a certain country have frequently sailed to Shantou, and sailors have gathered to take action. The number of policemen has increased without decreasing. All these are manifestations of aggressive ambitions. For the commercial aspect of invasion, it completely adopts hegemonic and unreasonable means to achieve its sales purposes. This plan is implemented by a certain country who gathers two or three hundred ronin from Taiwan to Shantou. Among them, the majority of ronin are originally Chinese people from Xiamen and Shantou. In order to pretend to be威 and commit crimes, they specially join the nationality of a certain country to be driven to do things that violate our country's laws. This group of ronin, in addition to a part being selected as detectives, the rest are used as smugglers' bodyguards. As for the methods of smuggling goods from that country into and out of the country, there is a very large-scale organization. Merchants of all industries from a certain country in Shantou lure traitors to set up shops in Shantou and various counties in the interior. After the goods are smuggled into the country under the protection of ronin, they enter the shops set up by traitors, repackage them, and transport them to various affiliated companies in the interior to sell them. If the case is broken, the consul of that country will come forward, and few people will suffer losses. There are no less than thirty or forty stores in Shantou City that sell smuggled goods from that country. Dajing Township in Ting County near Shantou City even has a large-scale repackaging agency for goods from a certain country, which is presided over by Lin, a national of a certain country. It has been making profits for many years. As for the goods imported from a certain country, liquor, matches, sugar and medicine are the main products. Liquor, after being imported, is mixed with water and Huadiao wine to pretend to be Gaoliang wine. It can not only make huge profits, but also poison our people, killing two birds with one stone. Most of the liquor is repackaged at the Dajing Township repackaging agency, and a small part is repackaged in Shantou City. Recently, one place has been discovered. (Hualian News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e85">International Journalists' Delegation Arrives in Jiangxi <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Chunjin Personally Goes to the Dock to Welcome Them</p>
<p>Gong Xuesui Reports on the Construction of Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Red Bandit disaster in Jiangxi lasted for eight years. Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally led the troops to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression. The military and civilians cooperated to eliminate the rebels. Last winter, the bandit's nest was destroyed, and the remaining bandits fled like birds and beasts. The local authorities were also ordered to handle the aftermath so that the people who had suffered from the bandit disaster could celebrate their revival. This great feat of national revival has also received close attention from people all over the world. This time, foreign reporters stationed in Nanjing and Shanghai specially organized an international journalists' delegation to visit Jiangxi to see the various destruction caused by the Red Bandit disaster in Jiangxi and the various facilities after the national army recovered the area. The delegation arrived in the province on the 18th, and the local party, government, and military authorities received them. The people of Jiangxi Province sincerely hope that the delegation can declare the truth about the Red Bandit disaster in Jiangxi to the international community.

<h3 id="e89">Gong's Speech <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of this international press delegation in Nanchang is truly a grand event. On behalf of the 260,000 citizens, I would like to express my welcome. I am deeply honored that you gentlemen have graced us with your presence at the Municipal Committee's banquet tonight. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report on the construction of Jiangxi and the municipal administration of this city. 1. Construction of Jiangxi: Since the establishment of the Republic of China, this province has set up an agency in charge of the province's industrial and administrative affairs. The matters handled include rural areas, water conservancy, fisheries and animal husbandry, cultivation, industry and commerce, mining administration, municipal administration, transportation, mass organizations, labor-capital arbitration, and cooperatives. Its affiliated agencies have successively set up a highway office, a water conservancy bureau, a ceramics experimental institute, an industrial experimental institute, a geological and mining survey institute, a livelihood factory, a measurement and testing institute, a Pingxiang coal mine, a management office, and a construction bank, etc. Because the government attaches special importance to various undertakings, it specially established a rural cooperative committee three years ago to share the responsibility of rural cooperative undertakings with the Construction Department. Also, because of the emphasis on agriculture and forestry, an agricultural college was established a year ago, and the two farms in Nanchang and Hukou, and the three forest farms in Lushan Pengze and Jingdezhen, which were formerly under the jurisdiction of the Construction Department, were transferred to the Agricultural College and are now actively underway. Among the construction projects in this province in the past three years, the most noteworthy is the highway. To date, there are nearly 5,000 kilometers of highways that can be opened to traffic. This achievement is due to the voluntary service of the people and the enthusiastic participation of the army. The issue of vehicles traveling on the highways is now under study. Starting this year, we plan to use the people's habit of building roads to engage in water conservancy construction, such as dredging rivers, repairing embankments, digging ditches and ponds, etc. This plan will be completed in six years. Several months of labor will be requisitioned each year, totaling approximately 10 million workers. In addition, there are also development plans for local products in this province, such as porcelain, tea, paper, summer cloth, and鵭 mines. We are preparing to carry them out separately. 2. Municipal administration of this city: Jiangxi is an agricultural society, so it did not pay much attention to municipal administration in the past. The old urban area was only more than 26,350 mu (each mu is equal to 666 meters). Since the establishment of the Republic of China, transportation and industry and commerce have gradually developed, and the population of Nanchang has gradually increased. It was not until the revolutionary army arrived in Nanchang in the 15th year of the Republic of China that a municipal administration agency was established to dismantle the city walls and open up roads. Since last year, various municipal construction works have become more active. In short, they are as follows: (1) Reorganizing land and expanding the urban area: The land in the old urban area will be measured in detail, a 1/500 map will be made, private land will be registered separately, and household maps will be issued. At the same time, the urban area will be expanded tenfold. (2) Water supply and drainage facilities: The citizens of this city use river water as drinking water. A water filtration station was set up a year ago, which provides an average of 100,000 gallons of clean water to the citizens every day. Now we want to use 1.4 million yuan to open a water plant, which can produce 250,000 gallons of clean water per hour. As for the drainage facilities, there were originally very good ditches. Recently, due to the demolition of the city and the construction of roads, the drainage system is bound to change. The East Lake has now been dredged. According to the entire plan, water pipes will be installed. The drainage problem can be completely solved within two years. (3) Electric lights and telephones: The electric lights in this city were formerly run by merchants. The municipal administration agency temporarily took over the management a year ago. The old design was 1KW. Now we are adding 1KW and preparing to allocate another 1.8 million yuan to build a new power plant with three WK generators. In addition to electric lights, it will also supply industrial power. The telephones in this city were also originally run by merchants. Last year, the Ministry of Communications set up a telephone bureau to improve the telephones in this city. A communications building is now being built to move the three parts of telephone, telegraph, and post office into one building to facilitate the citizens. (4) Others: More than 300 mu of new residential areas have been opened up, and another 200 mu are now being expanded. One hundred buildings of public housing have been built, most of which have been completed. The ones currently being planned are the Confucius Temple, Tengwang Pavilion, the Bandit Suppression Memorial Hall, ten guild halls, a women's club, and five public bathhouses, as well as the reconstruction of the city's elementary schools. Regarding transportation, the roads are being widened and the Zhongzheng Bridge is being built to connect the transportation on both sides of the Gan River. In short, Jiangxi is bound to have a dilapidated appearance everywhere after being ravaged by the Communists. However, we believe that the Communists can destroy, we can build, the Communists destroy quickly, and we build even faster. The vigor of those in charge and the two hands of the common people are the driving force for building a new Jiangxi. Finally, I would like to toast this glass to the health of everyone.

<h3 id="e90">Yellow River Commission Plans to Formulate Ice Prevention and Guidance Measures <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Personnel Sent to Qinghe Town Longmen for Inspection</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission believes that the Yellow River's ice run is very important because it affects river engineering. First, wherever the ice goes, dams and slopes are damaged, and the amount of石料 lost each year is very large. Second, because the ice blocks the water, the water will rise, leading to overflowing embankments and breaches. Now that the ice season is approaching, ice has begun to flow in the Tongguan and Shaanxi areas since the beginning of this month. In order to thoroughly understand and prevent this, the Yellow River's ice run should be inspected and studied. It is reported that the commission has investigated the ice run conditions and losses in each section of Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces over the past ten years, and has compiled detailed statistics. In addition to formulating ice prevention and guidance measures, it has also sent several engineers to inspect the upstream and downstream areas. (1) Carefully examine the ice sealing conditions, ice layer thickness, and its extension and thawing conditions, and record the location in detail. (2) Investigate the size of ice blocks, ice run speed, and its拥遏 gathering conditions, and carefully examine the damage to dams and slopes. (3) Study the formation of the ice body, the specific gravity of the ice, the amount of sand mixed in the ice, and the reasons for拥遏. Special attention should be paid to places that are prone to拥遏, and the effectiveness of various ice prevention and guidance methods should be inspected. It is recently heard that the commission has appointed Deputy Engineer Hua Guanshi and Assistant Engineer Xu Ruiao to inspect the Shili Pu and Qinghe Town areas of Shandong respectively, and Assistant Engineer Feng Tongyou to inspect the Hukou Longmen area. They departed from Bian yesterday and rushed to various places to work. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Recent Bandit Suppression Intelligence from Northeastern Fujian Province <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>—Huangkeng District, Jianyang County, Has Been Recovered—</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Red Bandits in northern Fujian were defeated by the national army, the counties that had been lost have been completely recovered. The large Red Bandit forces have indeed been eliminated, but sporadic bandits still appear in the border areas of Fujian and Zhejiang, including Zhenghe, Songxi, Pucheng, Chong'an, and the border areas of Longquan, Qingyuan, Jiangshan, and Qianshan counties, causing great disturbances. Recently, Liu Heding, the Pacification Commander of northern Fujian, dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them, contacted each other, and advanced at the same time. Therefore, in recent days, the bandit suppression battles on the Fujian border have been quite fierce. According to military news yesterday, the Zhang Brigade of Chong'an used artillery to bombard the bandit bunkers in the Sidou area the day before, and after three hours of fierce fighting, occupied the large bandit bunkers. The remaining bandits rolled down the mountains and fled. The Zhang Brigade continued to advance and successively occupied several large bandit bunkers northeast of Wudou. The bandits fled to Yangzhuang and resisted stubbornly. The Zhang Brigade pursued and encircled them with all its strength and recovered Yangzhuang. The bandits collapsed towards Da'an. Also, the Huangkeng District of Jianyang County, which is adjacent to Chong'an and Pucheng, was occupied by bandits for three years. It has also recently been recovered by the Zhou Zhisun Brigade. The fake teaching regiment and five or six hundred guerrillas fled to Chong'an Guangze. However, the area has been ravaged by bandits for a long time and is extremely dilapidated. The Jianyang County Government telegraphed the province yesterday requesting that special commissioners be sent to provide relief and handle the aftermath as soon as possible. As for the eastern Fujian area, after Wang Jingjiu, the Garrison Commander of eastern Fujian, dispatched troops to encircle and suppress the bandit forces in Lianjiang and Luoyuan counties near the province, most of them have been eliminated, and only a few hundred people remain as small groups of sporadic bandits. Currently, in addition to deploying some troops to various districts to cooperate with local militias to search for sporadic bandits, another part of the troops is assisting the villagers in building roads to facilitate transportation. However, in the counties of Fu'an, Ningde, and Shouting, which are farther away from the province, Feng Pintai, the commander of the fake independent division, still commands Fan Tiemin, Ren Tiefeng, Ma Liefeng, and Xu Aman to appear and plunder. After consultation, Xiao Qian, the commander of the New Tenth Division, and Xu Hu, the administrative commissioner of the Second District, decided to advance separately and assign local security groups to intercept them, so as to eliminate the remaining bandits in a short period of time.

<h3 id="e92">This Year's Construction Plan for Fujian Province <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>—Stipulating Three Items: Water Conservancy, Agriculture and Forestry, and Highways—</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Government, now that the Red Bandits have been quelled and order is gradually stabilizing, has decided to undertake local construction starting in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], to seek the revitalization of society. However, due to financial difficulties, it has specially petitioned the Central Government to approve the issuance of construction bonds worth three million yuan for the purpose of handling agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and highways. These bonds are guaranteed by the revenue from the provincial slaughter tax, with an annual interest rate of 7%, to be repaid in eight years. The principle has now been approved by the Executive Yuan, and issuance can begin once the Legislative Yuan passes it. As for the construction plan, it was decided by the Provincial Government Committee meeting to: (1) Establish a Provincial Water Conservancy General Engineering Office, abolishing the existing Min River Engineering Committee and the Changle Irrigation Engineering Office, and merging them into the new office to handle the planning and implementation of water conservancy projects throughout the province. The monthly expenses will be approximately 2,000 yuan. In addition to fully allocating the original expenses of the Min River Engineering Committee, which amounted to over 1,000 yuan, the Provincial Government will provide an additional 500 yuan per month. It is expected that the office can be established around February 1st, under the jurisdiction of the Construction Department. It is internally decided that Mr. Li will be the director. As the irrigation of farmland in Fujian Province relies entirely on natural rainfall and rivers, and suffers significant losses due to droughts, the office will prioritize the interests of farmland irrigation after its establishment. (2) Prepare for the establishment of a General Agriculture and Forestry Improvement Farm, and establish branch farms and nurseries in stages. The work plan of the farm is to improve agriculture and promote forestry. It is planned to establish agriculture farms in Changle, Nan'an, and Zhangpu counties, a forestry farm in Nanping, nurseries in Minhou and Putian counties, an insect research institute in Fuzhou, a livestock experiment farm, a Yongding tobacco improvement farm, a Fu'an tea improvement farm, a fertilizer management office, a Longxi sugarcane seedling farm, livestock farms in Jinjiang and Anxi counties, and rainfall measuring stations in fifteen counties including Minhou, Changle, Liancheng, Jiangle, Zhao'an, Wuping, Jianyang, Pucheng, Datian, Pingnan, Pingtan, Minqing, Hui'an, Fuzhou, and Longyan, as well as meteorological observatories in six locations: Fuzhou, Xiamen, Sandu, Tingzhou, Yanping, and Pucheng, to lay the foundation for improving agriculture and water conservancy. (3) The total length of the highway lines in Fujian Province is over 1,200 kilometers. The Construction Department completed the construction of over 400 kilometers last year. This year, it plans to construct three main lines: from Jianning through Ninghua and Changting to Ruijin, from Shaxian through Yong'an and Liancheng to Changting, and from Shaxian through Qingliu and Ninghua to Shicheng, connecting the hinterlands of the four provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang. The earthwork will be undertaken by road construction teams organized by the garrisons in the counties along the lines, and the stonework will be undertaken by the Construction Department's engineering team. The expenses will be shared equally between the central and local governments. Yesterday, the Construction Department dispatched Chief Engineer Chen Yusheng, Engineers Chen Weifan, Qian Naiqing, and Xiong Shiping, leading surveying teams to Shaxian, Jianning, and Changting to survey the routes in order to start construction. It is also borrowing 800,000 yuan from the Central Bank, using the Central Government's contribution as collateral, to be repaid in two years, for the construction costs. A portion has already been allocated yesterday. (January 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Jiangsu Province Promotes Rural Sideline Occupations in Jiangbei <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>

<p>Shuyang: (1) Improve pig farming. (2) Advocate small handicrafts.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of promoting rural sideline occupations in various counties in Jiangbei, fish farming, chicken farming, and pig farming are more common in the areas along the river, followed by weaving cloth, knitting nets, and cultivating special crops. In the Huaiyang area, chicken farming, fish farming, and pig farming are more common, followed by straw hat braiding and beekeeping. In the Xuhai area, chicken farming, oil pressing, and wine brewing are more common. In the counties under Xuzhou, fruit trees are especially important. As for the establishment of sideline cooperatives and sideline training classes, it is quite common. This is the general situation of promoting rural sideline occupations in Jiangbei. Among them, the grape wine in Xiaoxian, the cloth production and sales cooperative in Nantong, and the large-scale beekeeping industry in Rugao have achieved particularly remarkable results. In order to actively promote rural sideline occupations in various counties in Jiangbei, the Construction Department is still urging all counties to earnestly handle them. If given time, the future development of rural sideline occupations in Jiangbei can be predicted.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Jin Tigan is handling the Baojia [system of collective responsibility] in the county quite seriously. In addition to personally accompanying the Party Committee to register households in Longxing Township in the first district to promote it, he has now decided to go to Yexie, Zhangze, Tinglin, and other places tomorrow (the 21st) to inspect the Baojia and, in the meantime, urge the collection of old debts. It will take about three or four days to return to the county seat. Che Zhao, the chief of the county finance section, was summoned to the provincial Department of Finance by telegram yesterday to receive training on necessary financial knowledge. In addition, the Department of Finance dispatched Tong Zhizhen to Songjiang today (the 20th) to contact the National Tax Collection Office for the withdrawal of funds. 200,000 yuan must be withdrawn within the lunar new year to meet the needs of the provincial treasury. Director Yang and Pan stated that it was difficult to urge collection and it was difficult to meet the deadline for remitting the funds. After several discussions, it was decided to try to collect and remit as much as possible. Wang Shaoyou, a central land surveyor, went to Suzhou yesterday to inspect the land survey work. After completing his official duties in Suzhou, he will return to Songjiang to continue his mission.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the rent collection office in the county, dozens of landlords have requested the arrest of tenant farmers every day. Recently, as the end of the lunar year is approaching, there has been an even greater influx of requests for arrest. Since February, the number of people arrested and sent to the detention center has reached more than 280, and will soon exceed this number. In order to increase the effectiveness of rent collection, the county government ordered the security team to take the detained tenant farmers to the stadium every day for military training, falsely claiming that they would be sent to the front line when necessary. Recently, the tenant farmers learned of this and, after training the day before yesterday, agreed not to eat lunch. The warden was quite shocked and reported it to the county magistrate. Therefore, the detained tenant farmers are no longer subjected to military training, but are instead assigned to labor service.</p>

<p>On the 15th of this month, the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau's Supervision Division cracked down on the Southeast Human Trafficking Headquarters in Xiang'an Lane on the road. The main criminals, Ma Zishan and other men and women, ten in total, were arrested on the spot. Based on their confession, personnel were dispatched to Suzhou and Zhenjiang to continue to apprehend accomplices Meng Ruifu, Jin Xiangyun, and a Mr. and Mrs. [omitted] totaling three people, and all were escorted to Wuxi and temporarily detained in the Public Security Bureau. Because the case still had developments, it was not until yesterday that the one thousand criminals were transferred to the local branch court for trial. Prosecutor Shen opened the court for interrogation, which lasted three hours. He ordered them to be detained together pending investigation.</p>

<p>The wine and sauce shops in this county, such as Yifeng, Chen Jinfeng, Hongtai, and Tongren, believe that since they have already paid the tobacco and alcohol license tax, the Wuxi District Xishi Tax Bureau under the Yingxi Tax Bureau is not complying with the exemption regulations of the Business Tax Law, and is still mixing the tobacco and alcohol items that have already been licensed with other sundries sold at the same time, and repeatedly collecting business tax together, which increases the additional burden on merchants and is an illegal overcharge that harms merchants and the people. Therefore, yesterday they jointly sent a letter to the trade association, requesting that the county chamber of commerce be immediately requested to forward a letter to the Business Tax Bureau to remove the tobacco and alcohol items and exempt them from tax in order to comply with the law.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Wujin and Yixing Counties Jointly Investigate the Abandoned Corpse by the Lake <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>In Caoshu Town, the eighth district of Wujin County, a bizarre murder case was rumored to have occurred last month. It was said that Zhou Zhongsheng, the town mayor and head of the self-defense regiment, had an affair with the daughter of a Mr. Sun, the owner of Rencun Sauce Garden. Recently, the woman had an affair with a clerk in the shop. Zhou Zhongsheng hated it to the core. One day, the clerk went on a secret rendezvous, which Zhou found out about. He immediately sent militiamen to surround them. The clerk dashed out, was shot and wounded, and stabbed to death with a bayonet. Afterwards, the body was abandoned in Taihu Lake to cover up the traces. Newspapers in Wuxi and Wujin counties competed to publish the story. Yang Kongxi, the chief prosecutor of the Wujin County Court, summoned Zhou Zhongsheng and others for interrogation once, but ordered them to return home because there was no corroborating evidence. Chief Prosecutor Yang believed that the case was important. He secretly went to investigate on the 17th of this month. On the 18th, the court suddenly received a telegram from the Yixing County Government, saying that a male corpse with gunshot wounds had been found in Chenshu Village, Fenshuidun, by Taihu Lake. It was feared that it was related to the Caoshu Bridge murder case, and they requested that personnel be sent to conduct a joint investigation. The court immediately dispatched investigator Shen Shaochun to Caoshu Bridge to report to Chief Prosecutor Yang, and the Yixing trial officer Qiu Hongzao had also arrived. They went to the lake together on the morning of the 19th to conduct a joint investigation. It was determined that the corpse was about 30 years old, had two gold teeth in its mouth, had a gunshot wound on its waist, three knife wounds, and multiple overlapping knife wounds on its lower abdomen. It was determined that the victim had been shot and then stabbed to death with overlapping knife wounds before his death. After the investigation, the village head was ordered to provide a coffin for burial and report it to the Yixing County Government. Trial Officer Qiu of Yixing left for Yixing. Chief Prosecutor Yang believed that the case seemed to be closely related to the suspected adultery case, so he returned to Caoshu Bridge. At the district office, he summoned Zhou Zhongsheng, Lu Zhengjun, a shareholder of the sauce garden, Han Chuanbao, a boatman, Zhou Fulin, a night watchman, and Qiu Changsheng, a self-defense regiment instructor, for interrogation, believing that they were highly suspected. He ordered them to be released on bail separately and ordered them to come to the court on the 23rd to await interrogation.</p>

<p>Yongfu Nunnery, an ancient temple in Beichi Village, Dingzha Town, was built during the Chongzhen period of the late Ming Dynasty. It is surrounded by pine and cypress trees and has abundant temple property. In the early years of the Republic, Li Dexiang came forward and introduced the monk Songting from Shujia Village to preside over the nunnery and set up a rural private school. Unexpectedly, Songting ignored the nunnery affairs and even sold ancient trees and used the proceeds for personal purposes. Recently, Shen Baode from the village, in order to preserve the ancient relics, specially invited donors and raised funds for renovation. When Songting received the news, he sneaked into the nunnery and erected a plaque, intending to show that he had repaired it. The villagers found out about this and questioned the monk. Songting became angry out of shame and colluded with Chen Yuqi, the village head of Beichi Village, to gather more than 50 people from Dongchi Village, each holding iron tools, and swarm to force Sun Bingxiang, a donor from Dongchi, to sign a statement acknowledging that the Yongfu Nunnery property would be managed by him in the future and that Songting would still be the abbot. Sun refused, stating that the nunnery was built by Beichi Village and there was a monument to prove it. Chen then ordered them to be beaten. The gengchu hoes came down at the same time and the order was in chaos. Chen Linsheng, Li Yulai, Li Dianxin, and others were injured on the spot. The Dingzha Public Security Bureau received the news and sent police to suppress it overnight.</p>

<p>At 12:00 p.m. on the 19th, a fire suddenly broke out in Qian Daheng Silk Shop at No. 29, Xingzhong Lane, Hangzhou City, due to a short circuit. The fire was quite fierce. Lu Weiquan, the owner of the shop, and his family members and partners were all awakened from their sleep and rushed out of the door to jump from the building to escape. Fire brigades and foreign volunteers rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until 1:20 a.m. today (20th). It is estimated that three halls and the accumulated goods were burned, worth about 30,000 yuan. Lu's mother-in-law, Ye Wang, was injured in both legs from jumping from the building and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Lu's wife, Wang, and her sister, Yuexian, and the maidservant were slightly injured and there was no major problem. In addition, Xu Liusan's family at No. 1, Jixiang Temple, west of Gongbu Bridge, caught fire due to a kerosene lamp falling over. It was extinguished after being watered down. Nine thatched houses were burned, and the loss was limited.</p>

Her mother, feeling sorry for her daughter, searched everywhere and was run over by a car and injured her foot. Zhu is also bedridden, which is quite pitiful. In addition, Tu Gen, the eight-year-old son of Wang Sanbao at No. 5, Sanguan Lane, Zhong'an Bridge, who is studying at a nearby elementary school, suddenly went missing the day before yesterday afternoon.

<p>Li Baokui, a foreign overseas Chinese citizen, about 50 years old, who lived about two li from Youguang Bridge, sixth district of Jiaxing, used to be a water police detective. During his tenure, he had repeatedly solved major cases. He is now retired and living at home, making a living by farming, and has hired a long-term worker, Yu Zaogui, to help with farming. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 p.m. on the 17th, Li had already fallen asleep when he suddenly heard a urgent knock on the door. When Li put on his clothes and opened the door, he was shot. Yu heard the gunshot and knew that something was wrong, but he dared not go out to see. After a while, there was no sound. He went to Li's house to see that Li had been shot several times and died. That night, Yu reported to the police station, which sent police to investigate. However, the bandits had already disappeared.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports: In recent years, the domestic goods market has spared no effort in developing the domestic goods industry. New products are emerging like bamboo shoots after the rain. The people's belief in using domestic goods has become increasingly strong, and the number of users is gradually increasing. Since the Chicago Exposition in the United States, the activities of Chinese national products in the international arena have also become more flexible. Currently, a South African merchant, Cahenoh, has come to China from South Africa to negotiate samples of Chinese national products with the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Co., Ltd. for exhibition in South Africa. It is reported that the company has agreed to handle more than ten cases of Jiangxi porcelain, Hangzhou silk, Fujian lacquerware, and Beijing carpets, which will be shipped soon.</p>

<p>Sales of Yarn and Cloth Are Shrinking Daily</p>
<p>Japanese Competition is Still Fierce</p>
<p>East China News Agency reports: The Manchester Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai issued its annual report on British trade with China yesterday, stating that China has become quieter, but trade activities have declined. It also stated that the decline in China's purchasing power is the main reason for the rapid decline in the Lancashire textile trade. For the past ten years, China has been a customer for British cotton yarn and cotton cloth, but recently, the sales of British yarn and cloth in China have been shrinking daily. In the first eleven months of 1934, the total export volume to China was only 11% of that in the same period of 1932. The way to improve the situation is to wait until China can sell its products at better prices domestically or until the demand for its products increases. Japanese competition is still fierce, mainly because of its proximity to China and convenient transportation. However, Japan's export trade is also gradually declining. It also stated that the frequent changes in Chinese tariffs make buyers cautious, which reduces trade and leads to a shortage of tax revenue. The current high tax rate is enough to encourage large-scale smuggling, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e109">French Colony to Increase Tea Tax <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Tea Exports to France Will Come to a Standstill</p>
<p>Tea Merchants Petition the Government to Negotiate</p>
<p>Last year, China's tea exports made considerable progress, especially in black tea, in addition to green tea. The same was true for exports to France. Due to the French government's increase in tea taxes in April last year, a total of 3,576 metric tons were exported to France in the first eleven months, a decrease of 44% compared to 6,379 metric tons in the same period of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), a particularly severe decline. Black tea amounted to 9,691 metric tons, an increase of more than one and a half times compared to 3,821 metric tons in the same period of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Without tax restrictions, the increase rate would have been even higher. According to Chen Yizhou, a representative of the foreign tea trade association, the French colony of Algeria sells about 50,000 boxes of high-quality green tea such as Wuyuan Yinguang Zhenmei every year (about 65 catties per box). The tax collection method in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) was about 8 jiao per catty. It is now planned to double the tax collection from January of this year. Therefore, tea merchants are greatly panicked. They previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting them to instruct the Chinese ambassador to France to negotiate with the French authorities to avoid increasing taxes. It is rumored that the French government plans to postpone the implementation for 45 days, until February 15th, but the new tea must be shipped to Shanghai for export between May and June. Even if the postponement is true, it will be of no avail. It is understood that the purpose of the French tax increase is to increase revenue. However, if this is implemented, our exports to Algeria will likely stop completely. In reality, the French may not benefit much, while our losses will be very heavy. The reason is that Chinese green tea has always relied on Morocco and Algeria as its final destination. In the midst of declining exports last year, there was an increase in exports to Algeria, with a total of 20,152 metric tons in the first eleven months, valued at 2,260,292 yuan, an increase of 2,773 metric tons and 270,264 yuan. In the future, the result of the tax increase will undoubtedly be the loss of a major market for green tea, and Japan will have another opportunity to compete for sales. At a time when the domestic export industry is declining, the seriousness of this issue is worthy of attention. Some say that if the French tax increase is inevitable, China can also choose important French imports and increase taxes on them to counter it. The idea is good, and it may be an effective countermeasure, but we believe that the long-standing friendly relations and flourishing trade between China and France should not be reduced by a tariff war. All tea merchants in Shanghai are currently preparing to submit a petition, requesting the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the Chinese ambassador to negotiate with France to avoid imposing heavy taxes.</p>

At that time, the principal and interest will be fully repaid. A representative will be appointed by the banking group to participate in the Zhejiang Provincial Public Debt Fund Management Committee.</p>

<p>Riri News Agency reports: The seventh batch of more than twenty overseas Chinese expelled from Japan arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Asama Maru at 12:00 noon yesterday. The ship docked at the Huishan Wharf. After the overseas Chinese landed, they dispersed to hostels for lodging. The large number of people expelled this time is unprecedented. Riri News Agency reporters have learned the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e114">List of Displaced Overseas Chinese <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The overseas Chinese expelled and arriving in Shanghai yesterday included Chen Jinyuan, Pan Hexing, Ying Jinfa, Zhuo Tianqing, Ye Shiming, Pan Shunfeng, Yang Heshun, Wang Guoxing, Yao Sanmei, Zhan Zhixing, Ye Yanfang, Ye Yanmei, Zhang Zhuming, Chen Yuanfa, Chen Jiali, Chen Ruikai, Zhou Jiayuan (the above seventeen people are from Qingtian County, Zhejiang), Cao Jinsheng (from Yangzhou, Jiangsu), Lin Jinyu, Lin Youshan, Lin Tongyao (from Fuzhou, Fujian), totaling twenty-one people. There are still several people whose addresses are unknown and cannot be found.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Account of the Expulsion <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas Chinese Zhan Zhixing and others told Riri News Agency reporters that they ran noodle shops or small businesses selling cotton cloth in the Boshu area of Chiba Prefecture, Japan. They were all legal merchants. However, on December 24th of last year, a large number of Japanese police suddenly came, arrested them, and detained them in the police station. They also sealed the shops and stopped business. On January 13th, they were taken to Yokohama and forced to board the Asama Maru to return to their country. This time, they estimate their losses to be tens of thousands of yuan. When they were detained in the police station, they were subjected to abuse, often beaten and whipped, and forced to admit that they were reactionary elements, which was the reason for their expulsion. The Japanese are very vicious and despicable. There are still hundreds of people in the police station who will be sent back one after another. They hope that the diplomatic authorities will properly handle the aftermath.</p>

<p>When the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission learned of the arrival of this batch of overseas Chinese, it immediately sent investigator Hou Can to receive them and inquire about the expulsion. It also handled registration to prepare for future service in the Anhui Qiaole Village. The bureau also decided to issue a relief fund of five yuan per person to the overseas Chinese today.</p>

<p>Complete Shutdown As Usual When Closing Accounts</p>
<p>Standard Silk is Worth About 500 Yuan Per Dan (Unit of Weight)</p>
<p>After the sharp decline in silk exports, silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were unable to maintain operations and almost all closed down. In Shanghai, the silk mills that barely maintained operations were: Gongda, Huasheng, Meifeng, Jiyu, Xinglun, Hengcang in the Zhabei District; Xiangcheng, Yutong, Fulun (Shuang Gong) in the Hongkou District; Baotai No. 1, No. 2 in the Nanshi District, totaling only eleven. At its peak, there were a total of 117 single and double cocoon silk mills in Shanghai, and now there are less than one-tenth. The silk mills that are currently in operation will completely shut down before the end of this month due to the closing of accounts for the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), as the female workers must return to their hometowns for the New Year according to annual custom. After the closing of accounts, they will resume operations. As for the B-grade standard silk in the silk market, it is currently around 500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Petitions for the Formulation of a Common Civil Etiquette System <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Etiquette is One of the Major Laws of the Country</p>
<p>Old Etiquette is Largely Incompatible with the Present</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Legislative Yuan yesterday, stating that it was petitioning for the matter. The Beijing Chamber of Commerce sent a letter requesting assistance in advocating for the Legislative Yuan to stipulate a common etiquette system for civilians in order to bring the people back on track. It was stated in the original case that the Republic of China has been established for twenty-three years, and only the rituals for audience and awarding medals have been established. The rituals for civil marriages, funerals, condolences, and meetings have not been stipulated, allowing people to do as they please, resulting in strange situations and harming the national system. After verifying the points raised in the petition, it was found that they were in line with the actual situation. In the past, the state's system of rites and music was always established after governance was successful. In recent years, the situation has been turbulent, and the major policies of the country are awaiting attention, so the rituals have not been amended. Even the general public always considers this matter to be delayed. However, as a result of the reform of the national system, the old etiquette is largely incompatible with the present. This is different from the situation at the turn of dynasties, where the etiquette system of the previous dynasty can be inherited. If everything is modeled after Europe and the United States, it will not only be incompatible with the national conditions but will also lead to conflicts and a loss of the national independence and self-respect. Moreover, etiquette is one of the major laws of the country. It falls under the jurisdiction of your esteemed Yuan and is the responsibility of a dedicated department. It does not mean that the unfinished military affairs will prevent its deliberate discussion. The matter can be carried out in parallel without any conflict. It is different from the past system of rites and music, which must be established after the situation is settled and the task is accomplished. It is reasonable to submit the true situation to your esteemed Yuan for review, and it would be a public convenience if you would immediately refer to and amend it. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>Draft Plan Drawn Up Seeking Opinions from the Industry</p>
<p>Livelihood Relief Difficulties for Tens of Thousands of Employees</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that since January 1st of this year, the Postal Administration officially abolished the weighing regulations and punished private delivery of letters, the business of private postal agencies in Shanghai has been completely suspended. The national postal merchants previously petitioned the central government to revoke the ban order, but the Ministry of Communications has issued an order disapproving it. Therefore, local postal agencies plan to reorganize into forwarding agencies to handle parcel and silver ocean business. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Ministry of Communications Issues Order Disapproving <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>In December of last year, the National Federation of Private Postal Agencies sent seven chief representatives, including Wu Jinyun and Yin Yuantong, to Beijing to petition the National Government, the Fifth Plenary Session, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Industry, and other agencies, requesting the revocation of the order to end the business of private postal agencies. The Ministry of Communications formally issued an order to the delegation, stating that there was no need to discuss the request to revoke the order or extend the deadline. However, in consideration of the livelihood of merchants and employees, silver ocean parcels, etc., that are not associated with private postal services may still be delivered as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Business Completely Suspended <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The original deadline for the closure of private postal agencies was the end of December of last year, and all business was to be suspended. Because postal merchants wanted to maintain their livelihood, they continued to operate until they received a reply from the central government. The Shanghai Post Office, in order to implement the orders of the superiors, sent personnel to inspect the districts and arrested and detained postal workers and seized letters from Baoshun on Jiujiang Road and Quanchang on Xian Gua Street. Although the private postal agencies set up stations for delivery, senders, in order to avoid losses, sent all letters, silver oceans, and parcels through the post office. Therefore, since January 5th of this year, the business of various private postal agencies in Shanghai has been completely suspended. Even the number of silver ocean parcels sent to Ningbo, Wenzhou, and the interior is very small. Thousands of employees are staying in the agency, and the situation is very pitiful.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Plan to Establish a Forwarding Agency <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications issued an order disapproving the extension and business has been suspended, the income of private postal agencies in Shanghai is very small, while the food and accommodation of employees still need to be provided, resulting in heavy losses. Now that the Ministry of Communications has approved the remittance of silver ocean parcels, the delegation of chief representatives of the National Federation of Private Postal Agencies discussed the final solution and planned to reorganize the existing private postal agencies into forwarding agencies. This matter is of great importance and requires a large amount of funding. It has been notified to fellow industries in various places to solicit opinions before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Difficulties in Employee Relief <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the order from the Executive Yuan, the Shanghai Municipal Government repeatedly ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to persuade the postal merchants to close their businesses. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to investigate the business and number of employees of the private postal agencies in detail and discussed solutions. A Dagong News Agency reporter inquired at the private postal agency association about the employee relief issue. The person in charge replied that if the reorganization of the forwarding agency is successful and it specializes in remitting silver ocean parcels, the number of employees will naturally be reduced. If the reorganization cannot be achieved, they will be unemployed. The livelihood of tens of thousands of people is very serious, and they hope that the central government will care about the people's livelihood and provide them with proper resettlement. They also plan to gather postal merchants from all over the country to petition the central government again.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that since the September 18th Incident, the number of people from the Northeast in Shanghai has been increasing. Most of them are drifting and have nowhere to rely on. The government's relief efforts are limited.

<p>Discussion of Allocation of Funds Yields No Results</p>
<p>Dagong News reports: The Zhabei Fire Insurance Disaster Victim Claim Advancement Association has repeatedly sought claims from Chinese and foreign insurance companies, but without result. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, out of consideration for the disaster victims, raised 40,000 yuan in relief funds and handed it over to the association for distribution to the victims. The association specially convened a general meeting of all policyholders at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning to discuss the allocation method. More than 1,500 disaster victims attended.汤有为 (Tang Youwei), 方椒伯 (Fang Jiaobo), and 王志祥 (Wang Zhixiang) presided over the meeting. After the formalities, 方椒伯 (Fang Jiaobo) first reported on the progress of the claim process, followed by 汤有为 (Tang Youwei) who reported that during the negotiation of the claim, about 8,000 yuan of public funds had been used. These funds were all borrowed from various parties, so it was requested that they be reimbursed from the 40,000 yuan, leaving 32,000 yuan for distribution to the disaster victims. At that time, policyholder 范一峰 (Fan Yifeng) stood up and expressed his opposition, and demanded that the chairman publish a detailed account. The policyholders unanimously seconded the motion, but a few held dissenting views, causing considerable disorder at the meeting. It was then announced that no result had been achieved and the meeting was adjourned. According to an investigation by the Dagong News reporter, yesterday afternoon, more than 100 disaster victims went to the China Merchants Public Automobile Company to find 范一峰 (Fan Yifeng) and question him. The situation was very turbulent. The company reported to the relevant Fifth District Second Station, which dispatched police to arrive and disperse the crowd.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Chongming Association in Shanghai Launches Chongqi Merger Movement <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Initiate the Organization of a Committee to Promote the Merger</p>
<p>Elder Wang Qingmu Bitterly Speaks of the Evils of Division</p>
<p>Shanghai News reports: Chongming is located at the mouth of the river, with a dangerous terrain and a vital strategic position. In the past, it was an important naval town and the gateway to the Yangtze River. Originally, the inner and outer sandbars were combined into one county, and they lived in peace. However, since the Republic of China, a few people from the outer sandbar and 海门 (Haimen) people living in the outer sandbar, such as 施滋培 (Shi Zipei), have repeatedly requested division. After the sixteenth year, 施 (Shi) and others took advantage of the fact that the National Revolutionary Army had just pacified the Yangtze River, and actively engaged in the division movement in various ways. In February of the seventeenth year, the formal division was established. As a result, government expenses increased sharply, land taxes soared, and the people suffered deeply. Although the Chongming people sent telegrams and letters to express their opposition, the national and provincial governments were misled by preconceived notions and did not consult them. In recent years, the rural economy has become increasingly collapsed. The county has been affected by the division, water conservancy has been neglected, and droughts and floods have caused disasters. The people's livelihood is on the verge of collapse, and education fees are in arrears for more than ten months. There is also no ability to repair the bank protection and embankment projects. Therefore, the people of the county feel that they cannot survive unless they request a merger. There have been repeated petitions, and the fellow villagers of the two counties of Chongqi, who live in Beijing, 镇江 (Zhenjiang), 平 (Ping), and Shanghai, have also sent letters and telegrams to the government, requesting a merger. The Shanghai News reporter has specially investigated the situation from all parties for this matter and recorded it as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e136">Expand the Merger Movement <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Chongming Association in Shanghai was originally organized by 童行白 (Tong Xingbai), 杨震中 (Yang Zhenzhong), 陈东白 (Chen Dongbai), 施翀鹏 (Shi Chongpeng), and others from the county. It has now been formally established. When the first board of directors meeting was held, the proposal for promoting the merger of Chongqi submitted by the general meeting was discussed. It was unanimously decided to unite various groups in the native county and fellow villagers' groups in various places to initiate the organization of a committee to promote the merger of Chongqi. 理事 (Li Shi) 施翀鹏 (Shi Chongpeng) was entrusted to draft the preamble, and it was decided to hold a provisional board of directors meeting on the 22nd of this month to discuss the matter specifically. After the preamble is approved, the committee will be organized in conjunction with all parties to actively promote the merger in order to achieve the goal of merger.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Elder Wang Qingmu Speaks <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter interviewed the county elder, the former Director of the Taihu Water Conservancy Bureau, and the current member of the National Government's Huai River Guidance Committee, Wang Qingmu. According to him, the discussion of the division of Chongqi began in the early years of the Republic of China. 施滋培 (Shi Zipei), a 海门 (Haimen) person living in the outer sandbar, repeatedly requested the establishment of a separate county, but the provincial government did not allow it. Eight years later, the representatives from the inner and outer sandbars negotiated the plan at the 海道尹 (Haidaoyin) Public Office in Shanghai, such as adding administrative members, judicial reviewers, and separate grain collection offices to the outer sandbar. Everything that could facilitate the outer sandbar was taken care of, and the people of the outer sandbar lived in peace for a long time. It was suddenly divided in the seventeenth year. To explain the reason, it is extremely simple. To put it briefly, the inner and outer sandbars of Chongming can be compared to mother and son. The son never wanted to separate from his mother, establish a separate household, increase expenses, and cause more waste. However, several servants of the son seized the son and separated from the mother. After the separation, the mother and son were separated, and several servants either occupied the accounting room or held the silver box, and the owner could not interfere. The mother's property deposited with the son was confiscated. As a result, mother and son both felt pain and groaned endlessly. 清穆 (Qingmu) (self-proclaimed) is a servant on the mother's side and has no responsibility for management. He only hopes that the head of the family is upright, warns the servants, and allows the mother and son to reunite.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Evils of Division Over the Years <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Wang also spoke about the economic situation before and after the division, the gap between the high and low, and the difficulty of the people's power. Before the division, the inner and outer sandbars of Quan Chongming bore 22,000 taels of busy silver. After the division, the outer sandbar became Qidong, and the land area was reduced by most, while the inner sandbar still bore the entire amount. The outer sandbar separately levied more than 26,000 taels of busy silver, and the burden of provincial expenses more than doubled. If the local expenses are concerned, before the division, the budget for the 14th year of the Republic of China for the inner and outer sandbars of Chongming was 88,354 yuan in total for both regular and temporary items. After the division, the budget for Qidong in the 22nd year of the Republic of China was 449,875 yuan in total for both regular and temporary items. The budget for Chongming was 489,087 yuan in total for both regular and temporary items. The two totaled 938,963 yuan, an increase of nearly twelve times. It is difficult for the poor people of Chongqi to bear more than double the provincial expenses and twelve times the local expenses. It is like a thin sheep being burdened with ten catties, and now it is suddenly burdened with one hundred and twenty or thirty catties. Is it not on the verge of death? However, with such a large amount of provincial expenses used as county administrative expenses, it is still considered insufficient, and a surcharge of five cents is added to each tael of busy silver. With such a large amount of local expenses allocated to the two counties' internal affairs, charity, industry, finance, administration, social affairs, and cultural undertakings, there are times when it is not enough. The people's wealth has been exhausted, and the government's economy is still in trouble. To remedy this situation, the only way is to quickly merge, save expenses, reduce the burden, and the benefits will be immediately realized. Recently, I heard that the provincial government, taking into account the difficult situation of Chongqi, has submitted the merger issue to the financial, educational, and construction departments for deliberation and implementation. If it can be merged, then our 800,000 people will be able to see the light of day again and get rid of hidden pain.</p>

<p>Lawyer Liu Bin, a local, was previously arrested by the French Concession Patrol Bureau for collecting fees on behalf of others for obtaining stall licenses for the Julai Da Road vegetable market from the French Public Works Bureau. He was sent to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for fraud. After trial, he was sentenced to eight months in prison and fined 200 yuan.

Subsequently, after the Collegial Panel's trial, the sentence was changed to a fine of 800 yuan. After receiving the final judgment, Liu immediately paid the fine. In accordance with the instructions of the Judicial Administration Department No. 15307 of the previous year, only those who have been sentenced to imprisonment or detention should be suspended from practicing as lawyers.

They continued to work diligently and are commendable. In addition to recording their merits and rewarding them, Fa and Rao believed that Qian and Jiang, who were employed as translators, were able to solve major scams with their agile detective methods, eliminating harm for the local area, and possessing considerable detective knowledge.

<h3 id="e151">The Suspect in the Shooting of the Indian Police Officer Changes His Confession <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Hongtian Ordered to be Returned to Custody Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Jinsheng Handed Over to the Second Special Court</p>
<p>On the evening of December 9th last year, at 10:45 PM, Indian policeman No. 258 of the Yangshupu Patrol Bureau was shot and seriously injured while patrolling on Hejian Road. He was sent to the hospital for treatment but died. At that time, a gray felt copper pot hat and a cartridge case were left at the scene. Later, Chinese detective Su Yinggen received a report from an informant and, in cooperation with Chinese detective Liu Wenzao and detective Hua Shouqi, arrested the suspects, Zhou Hongtian and Wang Jinsheng, from Taizhou, on Aiduya Road, Xizang Road, and the Gongguan Malu Mofang Street in the French Concession. They were sent to the First Special District Court and blamed each other. The case was under investigation. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi came to the Second Criminal Court for trial. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Bureau stated that the handgun used to shoot the Indian police officer was made in China, specifically at the former Shanghai Arsenal, with the words "Shanghai" and the number 2740. On the 16th of the same month, the defendant Wang Jinsheng colluded with the already arrested thief Wang Jinfa by the French Concession Patrol Bureau to rob a resident at 263 Baer Road. The Second Special District Court has dispatched bailiffs to the court. The defendant Zhou Hongtian admitted at the patrol bureau that he and Wang Jinsheng went to Yangshupu to rob a property. He had a Shanghai brand handgun, but because Wang Jinsheng did not have a gun, he was afraid it would be difficult to achieve their goal. They saw a Japanese police officer No. 42 walking on the road and tried to seize his pistol but failed. They changed their plan and then shot the Indian police officer from behind. The officer was hit and fell. In panic, he abandoned his felt hat and fled to the French Concession where he was arrested. He presented his confession. He also stated that the handgun was seized by the French Concession Patrol Bureau when Wang Jinfa was arrested. A Westerner from the Public Patrol Bureau's handgun department examined the bullets inside and found that they were identical to the bullet removed from the Indian police officer's body and the cartridge case found at the scene. Enlarged photos were taken and submitted. He questioned Zhou Hongtian, who suddenly changed his confession, saying that what he said at the patrol bureau was not voluntary. In fact, the person who shot and injured the Indian police officer at the time was a man named Bao Gan who was at large. The remainder of his confession was evasive. Wang Jinsheng also changed his confession, claiming that at the time, Bao sent him to Yangshupu to visit a friend, and that Bao was the one who fired the shot at the Indian police officer. Although he knew Wang Jinfa, who was arrested in the French Concession, he did not go to rob the Baer Road property with him. Lawyer Li also stated that the Indian police officer, before his death in the hospital, said that there were only two murderers. Therefore, the confessions of the two defendants were false. According to the public notice submitted by Bailiff Liu, he requested that Wang Jinsheng be taken away to be interrogated together with Wang Jinfa and then returned. The court approved it. Lawyer Li also stated that, after the adjournment, the two defendants, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives, went to the scene to demonstrate in detail how they shot the Indian police officer and fled. Judge Wu ordered that the case be adjourned to the 16th for further questioning. Zhou Hongtian was returned to custody, and Wang Jinsheng was taken away by the police from the Second Special Court for interrogation and then returned. Wang Jinfa must be brought forward for questioning when the time comes.</p>

Sun's wife, Chen, from Guangdong, who was 37 years old, suddenly had suicidal thoughts due to her husband's imprisonment and her inability to repay the loan. She hanged herself to death at around 7:00 PM the night before. By the time her housemates noticed, she had already died and could not be saved. The Caojiadu Branch Bureau was notified, and the local Baojia officer was immediately ordered to report to the local court for inspection. The police were dispatched to summon Zhou Dexiang to the bureau for questioning and ordered him to post bail pending verification.</p>

<p>The Zhenhua Silk Factory, located at No. 10 Jintong Village, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, and owned by Yu Nianfang, caught fire last night around 9:00 PM.

<h3 id="e154">County Smokers to be Weaned in Stages <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Anti-Smoking Committee has drafted measures for weaning smokers in the county in stages. It has been found that the county's anti-smoking center can accommodate a number of smokers. Excluding those under compulsion for investigation, it can accommodate 30 people, in two batches per month, which is 60 people. Based on a detailed estimate of the total number of smokers, they can be completely weaned within three years. The measures for phased smoking cessation implemented by the committee are based on the seniority of age, with the young being weaned first, and if the ages are the same, those with lighter smoking habits are weaned first. Those who should be weaned but cannot be weaned due to illness must be diagnosed and confirmed by a doctor at the county's anti-smoking center before they can be allowed to postpone the weaning. The committee will notify the smokers who should be weaned in stages to come to the center for weaning, starting from November of this year. Every half month, 30 people will be weaned in turn, starting with the youngest.</p>

<p>At 7:40 PM the day before yesterday, Zhao Guanying, the police officer at the 16th post of the Tianbao Li Police Station, which belongs to the Mongolia Road Police Station in Zhabei, heard a commotion at the Ninganfang intersection on North Zhejiang Road while on duty. He immediately stepped forward to inquire. A fruit seller named Yuan Zichun claimed that he (referring to the other party) used a one-yuan counterfeit banknote from the Bank of China to buy two oranges from him, asking him to give change. He discovered that it was a counterfeit note, but he refused to exchange it back and even tried to beat him. While the police officer was questioning him, three more counterfeit notes of the same kind were suddenly found on the ground. A search of his body revealed ten one-yuan counterfeit banknotes and two ten-yuan counterfeit banknotes from the Bank of China in his crotch, as well as one five-yuan counterfeit banknote from the Central Bank and three ten-yuan counterfeit banknotes from the China and South Bank. The police officer Zhao knew that he was not a good person, so he immediately took him and the fruit seller Yuan Zichun to the station. After questioning by Inspector Li Yiqian, the suspect confessed that his name was Tian Hongchun, 43 years old, and he was from Ying County. He had been in Changzhou and had just come to Shanghai today (the day before yesterday). He admitted that the counterfeit banknotes were purchased from a Mr. Wang at No. 10 Chengmei Li, Fangbang Road, Nanshi. After hearing the confession, Inspector Li immediately escorted the suspect Tian to Nanshi with detective Sun Youzhi and others from the Mongolia Road Police Station. They went to No. 10 Chengmei Li, Fangbang Road, together with the Laobeimen Police Station, but Mr. Wang had already fled upon hearing the news. Only seven business cards of Tian Hongchun, a name stamp, and two photos were found and taken to the station. After further questioning, the prosecutor Yuan Zichun and the defendant Tian Hongchun, along with 69 yuan of counterfeit banknotes, were sent to the Zhabei branch of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau yesterday morning. Yesterday was Sunday, so they will be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court today.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Lawsuit Over Millions of Family Fortune, Numerous Descendants, and Unequal Circumstances <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Lawsuit Involving the Family of Minister to the United States, Shih Chao-chi</p>
<p>Nephews and Grandnephews Sue Over Property Division</p>
<p>The nephews, etc., of Minister to the United States, Shih Chao-chi, recently initiated a lawsuit in the First Special District Court over a dispute regarding the division of inheritance, which they failed to resolve peacefully. It is reported that Shih's uncle, Shih Shao-chin, had five sons: Tzu-ming, Tzu-ching, Tzu-hsuan, Tzu-ying, and Tzu-hsiang. All served as Tao-tais during the late Qing Dynasty. Tzu-hsiang then had five sons: Hsi-yuan, Tao-yuan, Pin-yuan, Hsin-yuan, and Chuan-yuan. Shih Chia-gu and Chia-hong, the current plaintiffs, are the children of Tao-yuan, who passed away the year before last, leaving behind his wife, Jiang Cai-zhen, who remains a widow and raises her orphaned sons. The defendants named in the lawsuit, Shih Lian-yuan, Bing-yuan, Jun-yuan, Zhen-yuan, Pin-yuan, Hsin-yuan, Jia-hua, Jia-zhen, etc., are either Tao-yuan's siblings, direct cousins, or nephews, all uncles and brothers of the two plaintiffs. According to their petition, plaintiff Jia-gu is only nine years old and suffers from a debilitating illness, making his treatment and care especially difficult. Plaintiff Jia-hong is only ten years old. Both depend on their mother for survival. Since the time of their great-grandfather Shao-chin, the family's assets have never been divided. Although estimated to be worth millions, the descendants are numerous and vary in age. Those who are older and influential possess vast wealth and live luxuriously, while those who are young and weak lack the resources for proper upbringing and education. For instance, defendant Zhen-yuan occupies a residence in the Dade Lane on Xinzha Road, defendant Jun-yuan occupies a residence in the Zhengxiu Lane on Kaifeng Road, defendants Pin-yuan and Hsin-yuan occupy residences in the Tangjia Lane, and defendants Jia-hua and Jia-zhen occupy residences in the Hengyuan Lane on Tianjin Road. These are all large buildings. There are also other movable and immovable properties that are difficult to ascertain at this time. The defendants are forcibly occupying the shared assets, taking whatever they want for their own enjoyment, while the plaintiffs are being deprived of their rightful share, leaving them unable to manage. In terms of human sentiment and legal principles, this is unfair. Therefore, they submit Shao-chin's family tree and request that the court order the defendants to hand over all of Shao-chin's inheritance for fair division according to the law. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong presided over the hearing. Three of the defendants, Shih Bing-yuan, Lian-yuan, and Jun-yuan, hired lawyer Zhu Sifu to represent them in court. Both sides presented their points of contention. In addition, defendant Shih Zhen-yuan's wife, Ms. Wang, also appeared and expressed her views on how the Hengyuan Lane property, currently occupied by Zhen-yuan, should be divided. Judge Shen then stated that the case was very complicated and adjourned the hearing for further investigation and examination at a later date.</p>

<p>Ice Thawing Gradually, Fog Last Night</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, since the sudden cold snap that began on the 14th of this month, all ditches in the city have been covered with a thin layer of ice, and household water also freezes, thawing only after noon. By yesterday, the weather had warmed up again, and the wind direction shifted from northwest to northeast. Although still cool, it was no longer bone-chilling. Checking the calendar, today is the Great Cold solar term, marking the end of winter and the return of yang energy. Therefore, it is speculated that the winter will not be too cold, but spring chills should be guarded against. If, after the beginning of spring, there are continuous rains and snow, the agricultural harvest for this year will be a cause for great concern. Furthermore, starting around 7 PM last night, the city was again shrouded in fog, making visibility quite poor at a distance.</p>

<p>Four Knife Wounds, Blood Everywhere</p>
<p>The Truth Remains Unclear</p>
<p>Inside the lookout post of the patrol police station No. 308, opposite the Japanese Club on Peng Road, Wusong Road, Hongkou, a murdered man was suddenly discovered around 8:30 PM last night.

The police are also examining the surrounding area for clues to apprehend the murderer. As for the name of the murdered man and where he lived, no one among the neighbors recognized him after inquiries. Therefore, the police are currently investigating, and they hope that anyone with a missing family member will come to identify the body. The truth remains unclear.</p>

<p>Gao Gongmao, a salesman for the Shunchang Stone Powder Factory (incorrectly reported as an engineer yesterday) on Avenue Petain, was kidnapped along with the car on the morning of the day before yesterday at about 9:50AM. He was with the factory director, Ma Xiong Guan, travelling in the company's Austin car with license plates number 1741 (Municipal) and 4676 (Concession). Four bandits suddenly appeared near the Dada Rubber Shoe Factory and dragged Ma down, taking Gao and the car. It was reported yesterday. Now it is learned that the car was discovered at about 3:10 AM yesterday morning at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Ratard in the French Concession. The French police patrol noticed it and immediately notified the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to notify Ma Xiong Guan yesterday morning to retrieve the car. After inspecting the car, there were no traces or damage. However, the reason for Gao's kidnapping is quite strange, as he is known to be in dire financial straits.</p>

<p>Major Theft Cracked by Lao Beimen Police Station</p>
<p>Chief Shen Zhenhua Investigates the Truth</p>
<p>The Zonglu Business Typewriting and Shorthand Institute on Nanwang Yima Lane, Xin Beimen, was robbed of eight typewriters around 3 AM yesterday morning. They include four 8-inch Ente routers, one 14-inch Ente router, one 8-inch Lemington, and one 42-inch Simi, valued at more than one thousand yuan. The owner, Hu Zonglu, reported the theft to the Lao Beimen Police (formerly District One, Section One) at around 9 AM. Chief Shen Zhenhua ordered his subordinates to solve the case and recover the stolen goods as soon as possible. According to police officers Mu Hongzao, Jiang Yongqing, Niu Zhenqing, and Zong Zisheng, they encountered Fan Yizhen, a second-hand goods dealer known as "Lai Zi" (leprosy), walking through Wang Yima Lane around 3 AM this morning while patrolling. When questioned, he said that he was returning from playing mahjong at a friend's house on Xin Kaihe. Since Fan Yizhen lived at No. 5 Chunhua Lane, had a family, and smelled strongly of alcohol, it seemed reasonable that he was returning home late after drinking while playing mahjong. The police did not suspect him of any wrongdoing. However, after the major theft occurred in the lane, the police officers immediately pursued Fan Yizhen and questioned him severely. Fan became nervous and evasive, revealing many suspicious points. Therefore, he was taken to the police station. After repeated questioning by Chief Shen Zhenhua, Fan confessed to the theft with his accomplice, Wang A'gen. Wang A'gen was then arrested, and he truthfully confessed to the details of the theft and the location of the stolen goods. Then, inspector Zhang Lantian and police chief Gao Kui went to the home of Hu Wangshi at No. 2 Deyu Lane, Qinglian Yuan, and recovered the stolen goods, eight typewriters. It was reported that the stolen goods had been moved three times. When police officers searched Fan Yizhen's home, Fan's wife, Fan Lu Shi, tried to throw a bundle of pawn tickets, totaling thirty, on the ground, but they were seized by the police. It is believed that the pawned items were illegally obtained. All the stolen goods have been retrieved by the owner. Three thieves, one receiver of stolen goods, and two suspects, Lu Genxiao and Zhu Nianchun, along with the owner's receipt and thirty pawn tickets from the thieves, have been handed over to the bureau for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Court Orders Audit of Accounts of Guohua Electric and汽 Company <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Court Orders Both Parties to Thoroughly Investigate the Accounts</p>
<p>Guohua Electric and汽 Material Company, originally located on Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, relocated to Nanjing Road in the Public Concession on September 25th of last year due to poor business and significant losses, after a major redecoration with the hope of improvement. Unfortunately, the company was unable to sustain itself and declared bankruptcy on November 15th due to financial exhaustion. Twenty-six Chinese and foreign merchants, including Oechsle, who had extended credit to the company, were owed a total of twenty-seven to twenty-eight thousand yuan. Believing that the company was engaging in fraudulent activities, they jointly hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a criminal lawsuit against the company's shareholders and chairman, Zhou Xiaoqing, as well as directors Chen Zizhen, Zhang Yansheng, Lu Mujun, Zhang Junliang, Yin Guisheng, Gu Ziyan, and supervisors Xia Jifu, Zhu Zhenlu, and manager Liu Hesheng for fraud. The First Special District Court has already heard the case, as previously reported. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang continued the hearing. Only Gu Ziyan, one of the defendants, failed to appear. According to lawyer Chen, the court previously allowed the plaintiffs to send an accountant to the defendants' liquidation office to audit the accounts, but the accountant sent by the plaintiffs was repeatedly rebuffed by the other party. Subsequently, Zhu Zhenlu, the lawyer for one of the defendants, even sent a letter to the plaintiffs stating that the shareholders had resolved to reject the plaintiffs' audit, which was a clear violation of the court's order. The plaintiffs are suing for failure to honor checks, violation of the Company Law, and fraud in obtaining property, and to prove the defendants' guilt, their accounts must be thoroughly investigated. The court then summoned Chao Jimei, the accountant hired by the defendants, to inquire about the situation. Chen, the accountant hired by the plaintiffs, also gave a brief report. As a result, Judge Huang ordered both parties to pay two hundred yuan each within three days for the audit fee, and then an accountant will be appointed to investigate the accounts before further hearings.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Mr. Mi Qianliang's Purchase of Chinese Floral Carpets <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Considerable Effort in the Process</p>
<p>Ultimately Succeeded Against the Clock</p>
<p>Shipped to the United States as Scheduled</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported, "Success or failure depends on winning against time, which can be proven anywhere. In this case, Mr. Mi Qianliang was fortunate enough to win against time; otherwise, his months of hard work in China would have been in vain. Mr. Mi was commissioned to come to China to purchase floral carpets for the opening of the New York Exhibition on the 11th of this month. After arriving in Shanghai three months ago, he went to Beijing to have 170 different kinds of floral carpet samples woven, each measuring four feet by two feet. Once completed, they were packed into six large boxes (each five feet long and three and a half feet wide and high) and he took them on the Blue Express train heading south, intending to arrive in Shanghai on Friday morning and immediately board the President Taft mail steamer back to the United States. Unexpectedly, according to railway regulations, he could not carry them with him, causing Mr. Mi great disappointment, as if he shipped them on the next ship to the United States, they would likely not arrive in time for the exhibition. Therefore, Mr. Mi consulted with the Shanghai Moutai Company and requested assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, railway authorities, the mail steamer company, the manager of the Eastern Passenger Agency, the Nanjing government, and the Jianghai Customs. The only thing he could not negotiate was the tide, as the President Taft steamer needed tidal power and had to weigh anchor at 8 AM on Saturday morning, regardless of whether the carpets had arrived on board. Since Mr. Mi was restricted by railway regulations from carrying the carpets with him, he immediately set off for Shanghai to find another way to catch the steamer, leaving his representative on the train to negotiate with the railway authorities to have the boxes transported by express train the next day. The train was scheduled to arrive at the North Station at 7:40 AM on Saturday, leaving Mr. Mi and his assistants only twenty minutes to transport the boxes to the President Taft, which was anchored midstream in the Huangpu River four miles downstream from the Waterworks Company. Previously, Mr. Mi had telegraphed the relevant authorities to ask for their cooperation. On Friday, Moutai Company also contacted the police and other parties, and drove in a car from the North Station to the wharf for a trial run. The police agreed to provide special convenience for transporting the goods, and the driver of the car from the Waterworks Company also agreed to lend its wharf. However, for ease of loading and unloading, it was decided to use the new wharf built by the Shanghai Municipal Council on Qiwupu Road. The drive from the North Station to the wharf would take twelve minutes, but as loading and unloading would take some time, it was quite worrying. Fortunately, a motor vehicle from the police department would escort them, so there should be no mistakes. On Saturday morning, the train arrived three minutes earlier than scheduled, thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of the railway authorities. With the help of the police managing the North Station, the car was parked in a particularly convenient location on the platform. Therefore, six minutes after the train arrived, the six large boxes and Mr. Mi's luggage had been loaded onto the car, which then sped along the Concession Road, Henan Road, Bazi Road, Faelun Road, Suzhou Road, across the Broadway Bridge, and then along Broadway Road, Yangshupu Road, and into Qiwupu Road, reaching the wharf. The four-mile journey was completed in nine minutes, three minutes faster than the twelve minutes of the trial run on Friday. Within two minutes, the boxes had been moved from the car to the lighter. After another minute, the lighter had reached the President Taft. The lighter sounded its whistle to inform the crew that Mr. Mi and his luggage were arriving. The crew also knew about this and had made all the preparations, waiting only for Mr. Mi and his luggage to board before weighing anchor. At that time, only customs officers were standing on the pontoon bridge, briefly inspecting Mr. Mi's luggage. Then, with a whistle, the President Taft raised anchor and set sail at 8 o'clock. The ship is scheduled to arrive in San Francisco on February 5th, where the carpets will be exhibited. The next day, they will be exhibited in Los Angeles, and on the 11th, they will be displayed at the New York Exhibition. Therefore, Mr. Mi still has a lot of work to do after arriving in the United States."</p>

<p>Sent to Hospital for Treatment in Critical Condition</p>
<p>The Assailant is Being Hunted</p>
<p>Shao Dai, a woman from Anhui in her thirties, is not unattractive, and she likes to dress up. Although she is middle-aged, she is still quite charming. Last year, she arrived in Shanghai by ship from her hometown and became involved with Yue Qiandou, who lives in the Nanshi district and works in industry. They began living together. However, Yue is addicted to opium and does not work properly, neglecting to support Shao Dai, making it difficult for her to live. Last month, she became romantically involved with Shao Guangren, who lives at No. 1527 Zhaozhou Road, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi district, and they began living together. Unfortunately, her previous paramour, Yue Qiandou, found out about this and was consumed by jealousy, plotting to harm her in revenge, but he did not succeed. Until the day before yesterday, Yue Qiandou gathered several ruffians and, taking advantage of Shao Guangren's absence, sneaked into Shao's home at No. 1527 Zhaozhou Road, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi district, and kidnapped Shao Dai to a straw shed in the Laoyingpan area of Nanshi district. He stabbed her repeatedly with a sharp triangular knife, inflicting a total of eight wounds, including one below the right eye, one below the left eye, causing the entire lower eyelid to fall off, one on the throat, and one on the right abdomen. Three of the wounds, including the one in the abdomen, were about two and a half inches deep, and she bled profusely. Later, her current paramour, Shao Guangren, returned home and learned that Shao Dai had been kidnapped by her former paramour, Yue Qiandou, and several ruffians to the aforementioned location. Fearing for her safety, he immediately reported the incident to the Huining Road Police Station of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and requested assistance in finding her. Police Chief Wang, after receiving the report, dispatched police officer Wang Xintian from post No. 48 to accompany Shao Guangren to the straw shed in the Laoyingpan area. They found Shao Dai lying in a pool of blood with knife wounds, barely alive. The assailant had fled. However, the woman was still able to speak and gave Shao Guangren and Officer Wang a detailed account of being kidnapped and attacked. Shao Guangren immediately took the injured woman to the Bobili Hospital on Route des Soeurs for treatment. The hospital doctors determined that the woman had lost too much blood and was in critical condition. Officer Wang reported the incident to Police Chief Li of the Ximen Branch, who then reported it to the General Bureau for filing, and ordered the arrest of the fleeing assailant for prosecution.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating: "Regarding the Ministry of Industry's communication, according to the report submitted by Kong Xiangxi and others from the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Drought Relief in Various Provinces, the source of wealth is none other than trees, and the method of disaster prevention is particularly important for afforestation. Our country has been plagued by natural disasters in recent years, and rural areas have gone bankrupt. The cause is not just one aspect, but the lack of human effort and the neglect of water conservancy are the real problems. Our country has a vast territory and abundant products, surpassing other countries. If we can promote afforestation, the northwest has many mountains, and the southeast has plenty of water, all of which can be adapted to local conditions to achieve the benefits of flood prevention. The land along the rivers can absorb water and prevent flooding, and the high and open areas can store water for irrigation. Moreover, afforestation along the Yangtze River can also conceal fortresses and strengthen national defense. Abundant forests can also promote the development of industry and commerce, achieving multiple benefits and not just reducing natural disasters such as floods and droughts. Therefore, we hereby submit this document for review and order relevant ministries and committees, as well as party departments, municipal governments, and county governments in each province, to simultaneously supervise and organize afforestation, so that promotion can be facilitated." Approved. Therefore, we order the county magistrates to comply and submit an afforestation plan for the spring within fifteen days of receiving this document to the Department of Construction for review and verification. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Record of the Second General Meeting of the Banking Association <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association held its second general meeting at 5:00 PM on January 19th of this year in the conference hall of the Bankers' Association at No. 59 Hong Kong Road in this city. Mr. Zhu Boquan, the chairman of the association, served as the chairman of the meeting. After the formal opening ceremony, the chairman delivered an opening speech. The main points of the opening speech can be divided into three aspects: (1) a description of the origins of the Banking Association; (2) the contributions of the British Bankers' Association to the British banking industry; and (3) the hope that all members would utilize the organization of the Banking Association to make academic efforts. Subsequently, Mr. Mao Xiaxuan, the representative of the City Party Headquarters, delivered a speech. The main points of Mr. Mao's speech were to express the hope that the Banking Association would conduct substantial research on banking operations, and find ways to promote rural investment and establish various industries, so that the national banks would move towards a proper path. Afterwards, Dr. Ma Yinchu delivered a lecture on the silver issue. Dr. Ma discussed extensively the strategies of general economists to remedy the outflow of silver, with the following main points: 1. Measures to restrict import trade. China's annual trade deficit is very large, approximately 770 million yuan in 1933 and approximately 550 million yuan in 1934. To prohibit the export of silver, it is necessary to first find a solution to the trade deficit problem. Therefore, restricting import trade is a good measure, but there are two difficulties in implementation. Firstly, to restrict import trade, it is necessary to first investigate domestic needs and domestic production. However, China lacks reliable statistical materials, making this step of work quite difficult. Secondly, there are many foreign exporting merchants, and to restrict their import volume, it is impossible to directly negotiate with each merchant. It is necessary to entrust the governments of those countries to handle the matter. Once this agreement is signed, it is quite difficult to cancel. Our country has been constrained by tariff agreements in the past, and now making trade agreements, this kind of policy, I am afraid, will be difficult to obtain public support. 2. Centralized and controlled issuance measures. Concentrating the existing silver and having a central institution responsible for issuance, and then adding controlled issuance measures. The implementation of this method can both restrain import trade and protect domestic silver. However, the selection of this central institution is quite difficult. However, our country must eventually adopt a centralized issuance system. If the difficulties can be overcome, then using centralized and controlled issuance to restrain import trade and protect domestic silver may not be a good policy. 3. Measures to lower the exchange rate. Various countries have used methods of lowering their exchange rates to lower the exchange rate and encourage export trade. When they adopted this method, they had considerable backgrounds. For example, when US President Roosevelt adopted the policy of lowering the exchange rate, it was because the general farmers in the United States were debtors. After the value of the US currency was lowered, prices increased, making it easier for debtors to repay their debts. If our country adopts this method, it will be difficult to gain national sympathy because raising prices will make the general public feel even more difficult in their lives. 4. Trade associations of various industries automatically restrict the purchase of foreign goods. The nature of this method is the same as restricting trade, but it is not restricted by the government, but rather each industry association automatically stipulates the amount of foreign goods purchased by the corresponding industry. After Dr. Ma's lecture, a dinner was held. At the same time, Secretary Tang Boyuan reported on the general situation of the association's affairs in 1934, announced the results of the essay competition of the general meeting, and announced the results of the election of new directors. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>Yang Zishan Confesses to Colluding with Gang to Rob</p>
<p>At 8:50 PM the night before last, several robbers armed with weapons went to the cigarette paper and confectionery shop at No. 133 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession to rob. After the robbery, the robbers dispersed and fled towards the Chinese-controlled area with their loot. Police Officer Zhu Tingzuo, No. 54 beat of the Liyuan Road Substation of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, happened to spot a man around twenty years old wearing a gray overcoat acting suspiciously in that area while on duty. At the same time, Lin Ziwen and two other members of the Fourth Team of the Self-Defense Corps, while patrolling, also saw the man and knew he was not a good person. Therefore, they jointly followed and pursued him to Xinqiao Road in Zhangjiabang, where they finally apprehended one of the bandits. They took him to the police station, where Inspector Chen Shengzhou interrogated him that night. According to the suspect's confession, he is Yang Zishan, 24 years old, from Dongtai, living in a small inn in the French Concession. He directly admitted to colluding with two accomplices surnamed Cai who were still at large to rob the cigarette paper and confectionery shop at No. 133 Xujiahui Road. Based on the confession, Inspector Chen led the police to the Chinese-controlled area to round up the escaped Cai bandit but was unsuccessful. As a result, they arrested a suspect named Qian Chunzhao, a native of Yancheng, at the Laohuzao teahouse at No. 82 Jumen Road, and took him to the station along with the other suspect, preparing a document and the confession to transfer them to the Ximen Branch for interrogation. Six pawn tickets, ninety-three copper coins, and four firecrackers were found on Yang. It is reported that after learning of the incident, the French police also dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest the suspects. After chasing them to the Chinese-controlled area, the police officers and members of the Self-Defense Corps assisted in apprehending the bandits. Therefore, Deputy Detective Sui Wenzhi, No. 31, went to the Ximen Branch to request the Ximen Branch Chief Li to bring them back for questioning. After Chief Li requested instructions from the General Bureau, he was allowed to hand over the two suspects, Yang and Qian, to the officers to take to the French authorities for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>▲ Zhu Shaoyi Writes Characters to Help Disaster Relief Regarding the visit of the famous painter Zhu Shaoyi to Shanghai, which was recorded in this newspaper on the 13th, Zhu is a native of Luoshan County, Henan Province, born in the year Gui Si during the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty. He studied poetry and books in his youth and traveled to Ban'shui in his adulthood. In the first year of the Republic of China, he participated in the revolution in Wuhan and then studied at the Russian Language Society of the Dongqing Railway in Heilongjiang. After completing his studies, he studied at the Moscow Academy of Fine Arts in Russia. He returned to China in five years due to the outbreak of the European War. In six years, he entered politics in Guangdong under General Zhu Yuqiao for seven or eight years. He traveled to the Nanyang Islands and major commercial ports overseas, holding the ambition to travel around the world. Last year, he returned to China. In view of the increasingly difficult national affairs, he studied Taoism under the guidance of Mr. Song Ziyi to learn meditation, emptiness, and static work, and also wrote Buddhist characters of three to five feet, cultivating Taoism and writing, advancing in both for decades. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, he asked for disaster relief in Shanghai to distribute to the Yu people who were living in Taihu Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In the years of Nianyi and Nianer, he traveled in Suzhou and Hangzhou, helping disaster relief with calligraphy. In the year of Niansan, he wrote characters to help disaster relief in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. In the same year, he participated in the Henan Celebrity Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition on Double Tenth Day. He arrived in Shanghai in January of this year. He has received sponsorship from famous celebrities and scholars in Shanghai, and he is ashamed that he cannot repay them. He is temporarily residing at Renji Lane 27, Ximen Road, French Concession, to cultivate stillness. When the work is completed, he will write characters to help disaster relief.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Upon reading the "Buddhism Groups Cast Giant Far East Bell" news item in the local news column of yesterday's (19th) issue of your newspaper, there are two points that do not conform to the facts: (1) The initiating groups are the China Buddhist Association, the Shanghai Buddhist Association, the Jiuhua Buddhist Association, the Buddhist Pure Karma Society, the World Buddhist Laymen's Society, and the Buddhist Book Bureau. Yesterday's newspaper mistakenly listed the "Buddhist Lianhua Society" as one of the initiating groups and omitted the Jiuhua Buddhist Association. (2) Yesterday's newspaper stated that "the bell is currently being manufactured by Shen Yuanji Foundry in Pudong," which is also not a fact. It is verified that the model bell that has been cast and displayed was made by the foundry. As for which foundry will be commissioned to officially cast the giant bell in the future, it has not yet been determined. It may be necessary to hold a bidding process to decide, in order to be fair and just. Therefore, we are sending this letter to request a correction and hope that you will publish this letter in the Letter to the Editor column of your newspaper to make a correction. We would be extremely grateful. Sincerely, The Preparatory Office for the Construction of the Youming Bell of Jiuhua Mountain, January 20.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Basic Principles of the Five-Power Constitution by Zhang Yuanruo <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Public law scholar Zhang Yuanruo, at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, delivered a broadcast lecture at the Shanghai Sino-Western Radio Station, entitled "Basic Principles of the Five-Power Constitution." The original manuscript is recorded below:</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Today, at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, I am here to deliver a broadcast lecture entitled "The Five-Power Constitution." This topic was predetermined by the Bureau of Education. Due to time constraints, I am unable to elaborate in detail. I will supplement any omissions with a special article.</p>
<p>There is no law that lasts forever, nor is there a perfect system. Han Fei said, "If the law changes with the times, it will be well-governed; if the governance suits the world, it will be meritorious." (Han Fei's "Heart and Measure" chapter). Since the founding of the Republic of China, although we have tried the good systems of various countries in the world, we have rarely achieved long-term stability and effective governance. Therefore, when discussing the central political system today, we must not seek extravagant hopes that are divorced from reality, but only seek to establish laws and execute orders, achieving "suitability and merit."</p>
<p>II. Basic Principles of the Five-Power Constitution</p>
<p>Politics, by its nature, cannot completely escape the relationship of strength and weakness. Regardless of the political system, its practical application cannot deviate from this principle. French jurist L. Duguit said that the origin of the state lies in the existence of strong and weak humans (Duguit has a separate annotation on the meaning of "strong," see his work "Traite de Droit Constitutionnel"). Haller also argued that the origin of the state is due to force. Duguit and Haller are both famous European scholars whose writings are followed by scholars. Haller's research on the origin of the state took nearly a decade. Their views have inherent truth. Therefore, modern political revolutions have fundamentally different characteristics from the French Revolution. This includes the improvement of parliamentary autocracy and the expansion of administrative power (see my book "Modern Constitutionalism," published by Zhonghua Book Company). The expansion of administrative power is not the "dictatorship" feared by the general public, but is precisely sufficient to "remedy dictatorship" and "prevent dictatorship" (see M. Dendiaq, "Les renforcement des pouvoirs de L'Etat dans la democratie porlementire," Paris, 1932). (Regarding this point, I have elaborated further in my lecture at Fudan University on "Democracy and Dictatorship." I welcome further correction from experts). This is the first basic principle that constitution-makers should confirm today.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen admired the American presidential system most. His highest ideal for the Five-Power Constitution was to realize an "omnipotent" government, enabling the state's administrative power to develop independently. Therefore, Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People did not inherit the old notions of "natural human rights" and "liberalism," but instead created the theory of "separation of powers and abilities," so that political power and governing power each have their scope and do not infringe upon each other. This is the second basic principle that constitution-makers should confirm today.</p>
<p>III. Understanding That Researchers of Chinese Constitution Should Have</p>
<p>Following the aforementioned principles, those who study the current draft constitution of China should have the following three understandings:</p>
<p>(1) The central political system in today's draft constitution should not continue to follow the established patterns of general constitutional states, blindly believing in the old theory of checks and balances of traditional governing power. The essence of the Five-Power Constitution lies not only in formally increasing three powers to five powers, but also in improving the efficiency of the government's governing power in its application. The principle of checks and balances in the Five-Power Constitution lies in the checks and balances between political power and governing power, and between the rights of the people and the power of the government, not in the mutual restraint of the government's governing power, which would prevent the government from exerting its effectiveness. This is the first understanding that researchers of the Chinese constitution should have today.</p>
<p>(2) Considering that the administrative departments of various countries are only subject to the constraints of the legislative department, there are already drawbacks of inefficiency. Now that our country advocates the so-called "capable government," the Executive Yuan seems to be subject to multiple restrictions from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the National Assembly, and the National Committee. Otherwise, it would be even more intensified than the traditional parliamentary system. The theory of checks and balances of governing power originated with Montesquieu. Montesquieu's theory claims to be objective, stating that it is based on British political experience. The strength of British politics lies in the separation of powers and mutual restraint. However, British constitutional scholar Walter Bagehot strongly opposed Montesquieu's theory, stating that the advantage of British politics lies precisely in the harmonious cooperation between parliament and the executive, not in mutual opposition and separation. It can be seen that the checks and balances of governing power are inherently flawed. Moreover, the parliamentary system was originally intended to restrict monarchical power, but the current administrative leaders are all elected by the people. Mutual checks and balances between powers from the same source are also lacking in legal justification. Even from the perspective of modern practical political experience, not only has the arrogance and autocracy of parliaments in various countries been deeply resented by politicians, but also due to the corruption and weakness of parliamentarians, the prestige of parliament has declined. Even James Bryce, who praised representative politics, wrote books criticizing the darkness of parliamentary politics (see my book "Modern Political Overview"). Therefore, the recent principle of political reform tends to strengthen executive power. This is the second understanding that researchers of the Chinese constitution should have today.</p>
<p>(3) Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan under the Five-Power Constitution is fundamentally different in nature from the parliaments of various countries. The Legislative Yuan in our country is a "capable" governing power organ, not a political power organ. Therefore, we must first distinguish between governing power and political power, and the power of the Legislative Yuan cannot infringe upon the functions of the National Assembly. Moreover, the new constitutions of various countries after the war have greatly restricted the legislative power of parliaments, on the one hand, subject to the restrictions of the people's rights, and on the other hand, subject to the restrictions of the president's legislative power. This can be seen from the constitutions of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, and Yugoslavia. Therefore, on the one hand, our constitution should strive to increase administrative power, and on the other hand, it should strive to adjust the relationship between executive and legislative powers. This is the third understanding that researchers of the Chinese constitution should have today. Otherwise, the future operation of the political machinery will inevitably present a state of contradiction and difficulty, and it will be difficult to achieve "the law is established and the orders are carried out" and "suitability and merit." I ask my fellow countrymen for their opinions.</p>

<p>Chapter 8: Remote Place, Unassuming Official, Strong-Willed Order; Grand Hall, Lavish Feast, Outside, a Pitiful Wretch</p>
<p>Zhiqian pushed back with both hands, saying, "I really don't deserve it. Think about it, Mr. Zhang and he are from the same hometown, so it wouldn't be appropriate for them to receive his things for free. I've never even met him, so how can I accept these valuable items worth thirty or forty dollars?" Zhang Jiefu smiled and said, "If Mr. Cheng feels that he must express his gratitude after accepting them, then just give me the credit. As for him giving them to me, I will naturally repay him. Mr. Cheng doesn't need to worry about it." Zhiqian clasped his fists and smiled, "It's still not appropriate to accept them." Zhang Jiefu placed both hands on the edge of the table, made an extremely difficult expression, and looked at Yuqi, saying, "Mr. Cheng really doesn't want to accept them, there's nothing I can do, but I'll lose too much face. Mr. Li Shilian and I are both new acquaintances of Mr. Cheng. Shilian often comes to Mr. Cheng's house to sit, and even invites Mr. Cheng to dinner. Now, when he comes to my place, I didn't expect that even if I sent something to Mr. Cheng, Mr. Cheng wouldn't appreciate it." Zhiqian couldn't help but chuckle and said, "Brother, what virtues and abilities do I possess that I deserve such kindness from Mr. Zhang? I really don't deserve it. Since you've said so, I'll accept it for now, and when Mr. Zhang needs something, I'll return the favor." Zhang Jiefu smiled when he heard that he was willing to accept it, then cupped his hands and said, "Brother doesn't need anything. If you immediately think about returning the favor after giving something to a friend, then this person is too lacking in self-respect. Where can you find a confidant?" Cheng Zhiqian saw that he was so diligent in giving gifts, there must be something he was asking for, so he would see what it was. If it was a small matter, he would agree, saving him from constantly pestering him. If it was a difficult matter, then he could honestly refuse and say that it was impossible to do. So, he invited him to sit opposite him and offered him tea and cigarettes. Zhang Jiefu first made some small talk, and then talked about the matter of getting a job in the province. (117)</p>
<h3 id="e194">About Phlegm <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhao Yu</p>
<p>Westerners and Americans mostly use their own prepared handkerchiefs to wrap their own spit and blown snot, and take them back as recycled goods, not willing to give away a single drop to someone else's house or on the road.</p>
<p>When Japanese people encounter snot and saliva, they mostly use their own prepared paper called "kaimi" to wrap them into small paper balls, throw them into paper scrap boxes, and give them to public servants (garbage collectors) as souvenirs.</p>
<p>Chinese people, if they have snot and saliva, can make any place a display venue for their products (snot and phlegm), regardless of whether people welcome it or not? Whether they want to see it or not? They take no responsibility at all.</p>
<p>From the above, we can obtain the following formula:——</p>
<p>Westerners (handkerchief wrapped) || Japanese (paper wrapped) || Chinese (display anywhere)</p>
<p>The digestion of Westerners' snot and saliva: is digested by clean water and transferred to the sewer.</p>
<p>The digestion of Japanese snot and saliva: is at the crematorium, or the sewer.</p>
<p>The digestion of Chinese snot and saliva: is sun-dried and dispersed in the air.</p>
<p>From this, we can draw a conclusion: that Westerners have relatively fewer infectious diseases.</p>
<p>According to his statistics, the most common infectious diseases among Japanese people are parasitic diseases and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The most common infectious diseases among Chinese people are scarlet fever, cholera, leprosy, parasitic diseases, and tuberculosis.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Watching the Waterfall at Mount Lao <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— By Dai Yuren</p>
<p>The weather this winter is warm, and no snowflakes have been seen in Shanghai and Qingdao. Mount Lao, about ninety li away from Qingdao City, is already covered in white snow. At that time, I was temporarily detained in Qingdao due to business. I heard that the snow scene and waterfalls of Mount Lao were quite spectacular, so I hurriedly hired a car to visit. After driving for half an hour, I saw a silver Mount Lao in the distance. After passing the Tanyue Bridge and the Fairy Pagoda, I arrived at the guardhouse in about an hour (the foot of Mount Lao). In the past, when the Germans ruled Qingdao, they set up a police station here, and the old name is still used. The car could have climbed the mountain, passing Liushu Terrace and Laocun Village, and reaching Beijiushui and other places. However, because the mountain slope was covered with slippery snow, it could not go up or down, so it stopped here. So I hired a mountain sedan and went up. First, I had lunch at the Laocun Hotel on Liushu Terrace. The windows were bright and the tables were clean. There were several plates of Western food, which were clean and tasty. Moreover, it was located halfway up the mountain, with elegant equipment. It was very suitable for escaping the summer heat here. After the meal, I took the sedan again, passed Laocun Village and arrived at Beijiushui. The sound of the spring was gurgling, and there were many shallow beaches, similar to the Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies of West Lake in Hangzhou, but quieter. Further ahead, the cliffs and strange rocks were extremely beautiful and majestic. The higher I went, the deeper the snow accumulated. At this point, it was already five or six inches deep. The road was even more slippery. I tried to get off the sedan and walk, but stopped after a few steps. The sedan carriers, on the other hand, strode forward as if nothing was wrong. After passing several stone steps, I finally reached the waterfall. The sound was like the tide, cascading down in three folds and converging into a pool. The water was clear and bottomless. The stone walls arched around it, and the words "Chaoyin Waterfall" were engraved in high places by Ye Gongchuo. The climate in the mountains was cold. I tried to climb the stone steps and looked at the white snow on the mountain peak from afar, and listened to the sound of the waterfall. I felt the cold air even more chilling and oppressive. I planned to go further to the top of the mountain, but the carriers said that the snow was more than a foot deep, the road was difficult to identify, and it was impossible to go. So I returned by the original route. At five o'clock, I boarded the China Merchants Bureau's Haiheng Wheel, left Qingdao and returned to Shanghai. The wheel is one of the four new wheels, with fast speed and complete equipment, and is the most complete of our country's sea wheels. Moreover, all the service equipment is in line with the tastes of the people of the country. People of the country often like to take foreign wheels. Now they can change to Chinese ships to show their patriotism, so I especially recommend it. (Reward for Refusal)</p>
<h3 id="e196">On the Wuxi-Changzhou Road <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— By Guocheng</p>
<p>This is my first time walking this Wuxi-Changzhou road. For two years, I've been running from the old capital to the south, wandering along the banks of the Yangtze River all day long. The whip of life won't let me stop for a moment. My exhausted body carries endless time. One day passes, and then another. I haven't even lived in Shanghai for a month, but I have to throw myself onto this road.</p>
<p>The telephone poles fly past the window one after another, accompanied by two or three scattered withered trees. The fields are covered with sparse, withered wheat seedlings, and the rotten leaves of rapeseed are spread out like broken umbrellas. Several thin little goats are tied to the roadside, searching for a few wild grasses left over from winter. Piles of dilapidated peasant huts flash by from time to time—a scene of desolation and decline. The scene of ugliness and brokenness can't help but make people think that the countryside is bankrupt! No matter what, it doesn't seem to be arranged according to my imagination at all. What else is there to say?</p>
<p>Let those young masters from bustling cities who are seeing the rural scenery for the first time write lyrical poems praising the beauty of the countryside. But for a person who wanders around all year round, approaching these so-called "poetic" scenes almost every day, I may not have the energy to get excited.</p>
<p>The long-distance bus is always shivering as if it has a cold, shaking and shaking. The road is bumpy and full of obstacles, but it never stops, rushing towards its destination, finally carrying us to Jiangyin Station, the end point.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers rushed to the station like a tide, the noise and roar of people vying for luggage and haggling over prices. This is a picture of the struggle for life.</p>
<p>"If you want to live, you have to fight"! To this day, I cannot deny this sentence.</p>

<p>— By Shen Shou Ruo</p>
<p>A heart made of iron and stone is just a figure of speech, after all, it belongs to the realm of ideals.</p>
<p>The facts tell us that people's hearts are close to being made of sugar. The empirical proof is: Sweet love, reaching a high degree of heat, no matter which side's heart is, is always soft and obedient; when love suddenly cools, the hearts begin to harden each other, often forgetting the old days of affection, and each going to extremes! Isn't this the same as the phenomenon of things made of sugar, which are soft when heated and hard when cold?</p>
<p>Therefore, I think: the terms of endearment between men and women in society, called sweethearts, are probably based on this original sugar-making material?</p>

<p>A very foolish person will not know what worries and anxieties there are in the world, but unfortunately I don't seem to be a very foolish person; a very wise person will not feel any worries and anxieties in the world either, but unfortunately I am not a very wise person either; in this way, I am often inevitably worried.</p>
<p>I remember that a certain staff member of the former Qing Dynasty said, "Heaven created our generation, neither making us wise, nor making us foolish, but giving us a body that is neither foolish nor wise, and placing us in a place that is neither dead nor alive"! Unfortunately, our encounters are mostly similar to this.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Ruogu, a writer familiar to readers of Spring and Autumn Magazine, has recently returned to China from Europe. In his spare time from writing, he is willing to serve as a French and piano professor for consulates or private individuals. Mr. Zhang has a deep understanding of the French language and is also proficient in music, so I am happy to introduce him. If there are any young people in this port who want to study with Mr. Zhang, please send a letter to Mr. Huang Jiping of the editorial department of this magazine for forwarding.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>She said, "Hundreds of years ago, we Manchus were still a very small tribe! But the leader at that time had a very great spirit of courage and bravery. He could not be satisfied with the life of a chieftain, so he carefully planned to annex many nearby tribes together to form a strong and prosperous country. He first immersed himself in hard work, actively preparing; later, he saw that the time had come, and he resolutely launched an attack. But the nearby tribes were not willing to bow their heads and surrender for a while; therefore, fierce warfare began. The blood and heads of warriors were constantly flowing and being thrown on the battlefield; and each victory always belonged to us. Seeing our land gradually expand, our power also gradually increased. Unexpectedly, in a certain expedition, this capable and experienced leader fell into the enemy's trick, causing him and a small group of soldiers to be surrounded in a forest as large as this. The situation was indeed extremely dangerous; it was not known when the reinforcements would arrive, and the enemy's encirclement was increasing layer by layer, but he was not afraid at all and never prepared to surrender; he was determined to continue fighting, so that even if there was only the last soldier left, he would still have to fight. But on this day, his food was almost gone, and everyone could only eat the remaining cold rice, mixed with some wild vegetables. The next day, he was finally rescued. Later, in order to commemorate the brave, hardworking, and indomitable spirit of their ancestors, every generation of our rulers had to hold a special ceremony on this day; this ceremony was very simple, only needing to eat some cold rice rolled up with undercooked Shandong kelp." Saying this, she gestured to Li Lianying, who hurriedly sent a group of little eunuchs to bring several very large food boxes. (227)</p>

<h3 id="e201">Parisian Theater Talk <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Mustard Seed</p>
<p>How many theaters are there in Paris? This is not an easy question to answer. In terms of large-scale theaters, there are probably over a hundred. The Opéra Garnier, which specializes in opera, and the Comédie-Française, which specializes in drama, are national theaters. As for privately established theaters, some perform opera, some perform drama, and some perform both opera and drama. There are so many different kinds that it is impossible to describe them all.</p>
<p>The architectural facilities of the national theaters are extremely magnificent. The plays performed there are all works of famous playwrights, and the actors are all the most famous in France. Sojourners living in Paris, when they find themselves in these national theaters, listening to singing and watching dancing, truly have the feeling that "this music should only exist in heaven, how often can it be heard in the human world!"</p>
<p>Here, we can certainly see the French nature of loving prosperity, but at the same time, we can also see the French adherence to old habits. The buildings of the various national theaters are all hundreds of years old. The carvings on the roofs and corridors are covered in cobwebs and dust, their splendor diminished. Some even display old stage curtains from the sixteenth century on the stage to show their long history.</p>
<p>The Comédie-Française, which performs dramas, also displays many statues of playwrights, all precious items from before the nineteenth century, such as Corneille, Molière, Hugo, and other statues of domestic and foreign playwrights. Among them, there is a statue of Fierre, which once had a wealthy nobleman willing to donate one million francs to purchase it but was unable to do so, which shows the value of those statues.</p>
<p>As for the privately established theaters, their architecture and facilities are newer than the national theaters. In particular, the plays and sets they perform are not as rigidly adhering to old conventions as the national theaters, so gentlemen who like fresh novelties flock to them.</p>
<p>In addition to theaters, there are also so-called music halls, which perform musical theater. Among them, one called the Moulin Rouge has stage settings, actors' costumes, lighting coordination, and the beauty of the music that surpasses other music halls. When we are among them, we can truly forget all the worries of life, as if entering a palace of pleasure.</p>
<p>The seat prices in music halls are several times higher than in ordinary theaters, and ordinary people do not dare to inquire. Most of the actors there engage in the life of goddesses, and ordinary families are even more reluctant to go. Those who linger there are wealthy merchants, foreigners, and young men who indulge in pleasure.</p>
<p>Paris's movie theaters are also scattered throughout the city, and the films shown are all from Hollywood. French-made films are only shown in smaller, less expensive movie theaters. In addition, there are also concert halls, circuses, vaudeville, and other theaters. Although there are not many, they still have their characteristics, which depend on the tastes of the people who go to the theaters.</p>
<p>The seat prices of the various theaters in Paris are determined by their position, front and back, high and low, expensive and cheap. Approximately the cheapest costs three or four francs (equivalent to about one yuan and five jiao in our currency), while the most expensive is more than seventy francs. The most expensive music halls can reach two or three hundred francs. A night of pleasure is worth the wealth of an average person. Prosperous Paris, extravagant Paris! Comparing it to Shanghai, the "Paris of the East," is truly far behind! —</p>

<h3 id="e202">Record of the Second Interport Football Trial Match <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Team B Wins Over Team A Six to Four</p>
<p>The Performance of Both Sides Was Not Very Exciting</p>
<p>Dai Linjing and Others Were Absent Yesterday</p>
<p>The second Shanghai interport football trial match was held at Shenyuan yesterday at 3 pm. More than 8,000 spectators attended, making it quite lively. The official players listed in Teams A and B, such as Dai Linjing, Shi Meidun, Xue Mengsi, and Liang Shutang, were all absent, which affected the overall performance. Moreover, the ground was wet and slippery, making movement difficult, making it even harder for the heroes to show their skills. Team A, which we ideally thought could represent the official lineup in the future, actually did have more advantages, but they were trapped due to underestimating the enemy, and the result was the opposite. Team B defeated Team A by a score of six to four. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Team A</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Li Ning, Mai Da, Sun Jinshun</p>
<p>Di Qu Li, Feng Yunyou, Li Yichen</p>
<p>Xiu Tuo, Lei Midi, Ke Lasha</p>
<p>Zhong Yongshen</p>
<p>▲Team B</p>
<p>Fu Luofu, Ge Linbo</p>
<p>Ma Shaner, Bao Seyilie</p>
<p>Hua Te, Chen Zhenxiang, Bao Xiu Tuo</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing, Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang, Ya Erjie (Up)</p>
<p>Fa Fanxiao (Down)</p>
<h3 id="e203">Review of the Official Lineup <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match is scheduled to be held in Hong Kong on February 4. The selection of the official players for the Shanghai team is a matter of utmost urgency. Based on the past records of each player and the two recent trial matches, the interport selection committee, with its rich experience in investigation, should be able to select the appropriate people to take on the important task of Shanghai team players. Based on my observations, I will conduct a brief review of each position and player selection, which should also serve as a reference for the committee.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Goalkeepers Available <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>There are three players who have hopes of being selected for the goalkeeper position: Di Quli, Hua Te, and Shi Mitun. Each of the three players appeared once in the two trial matches. Di Quli conceded six goals, Hua Te conceded four goals, and Shi Mitun conceded eight goals. The number of goals conceded varies, and the circumstances are also different. Shi Mitun spent his career in the midst of wind and rain. Eight goals is undoubtedly a large number, but without his saves, it would have been even more than this number. The loss of these eight goals was truly beyond human ability. As for Di Quli and Hua Te, they also gave excellent performances yesterday. Hua Te's situation was even more dangerous than Di Quli's. The first two goals were caused by Jiang's missed kicks, the third goal was lost due to Ma Shaner's oversight, and the fourth goal was lost in the crowd. Overall, there was no chance to take advantage of. Of Di Quli's six goals, the first, second, fourth, and sixth goals were either very close range or accidental, and he was not to blame for the loss. As for the remaining third and fifth goals, there is much to discuss, and it is not necessarily the case that they could not have been saved. As for Ke Kelan, he is also one of the upcoming players, but due to his qualifications, comparing the four, Shi Mitun's official selection and Hua Te's backup should not be a big problem.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Ordinary Inner Guards <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The inner guard positions include the Li Xiaoning and Lin Tuo group, the Ma Shaner and Shi Duke group, and the Ma Shaner and Jiang Shanjing group. The first group played in both matches. After Shi Duke of the second group changed to the center back position, he could not be as stable as before, so it was a fleeting moment. Yesterday, he was replaced by Jiang Shanjing. The Li Ning and Xiu Tuo group performed better the first time than the second time. Personally, Li Ning has a wealth of experience and has become more robust in his head and feet. His selection is undoubtedly. He is also a suitable assistant to Xiu Tuo. They have not been working together for long, so there are bound to be misunderstandings and confusion. However, if Ma Shaner is taken to replace Xiu Tuo, it will ultimately feel like the general is old and at the end of his strength. It is better to have someone who is young, strong, and able to fight for a long time. Jiang Shanjing is indeed a fierce general among the defenders, but his weakness is impatience. A little carelessness can lead to big mistakes. In conclusion, apart from Li Ning and Xiu Tuo, there are few competitors.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Difficult to Select Midfielders <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The center back position is the most difficult to select. Ga Xu is old, Gu Sitan has retired, and Pike is fat. So far, the outstanding players are Feng Yunyou, Chen Zhenxiang, and Xue Mengsi. However, strictly speaking, Feng Yunyou is approaching the end of his career, Chen Zhenxiang is not comprehensive enough, and Xue Mengsi is not in the right position. Compared with Gong Lijing, he is not as experienced. Feng's selection is a natural trend. There are four players with considerable qualifications for the left and right backs: Lei Midi and Mai Da, Chen Hongguang and Fu Luofu. Lei Midi is an old general, and his prestige remains. He will definitely be selected. The so-called question is which of Mai Da and Chen Hongguang will be selected. The two have their own strengths. Unfortunately, Chen is in the same right winger position as Lei Midi, so Mai Da's hope is closer. Fu Luofu is also a talented horse, but he is not enough to compare with the previous three. He still needs to go through considerable military life.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Capable Forwards <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The five forwards are the most important to study. The heroes are gathered, and it is not easy to pick them. Dai Linjing has a knee injury and was absent twice. It seems that he has given up the center forward position. The center forward must be able to contact the left and right inside forwards, and especially be able to take care of both wings. The responsibility is not light. Based on the results of the two recent trial matches, Portuguese Ke Lasha is the only choice, and pairing him with Sun Jinshun and Bao Seyilie as the left and right wingers would be the icing on the cake, and it would be beautiful. The excellent performance of the three working together for the first time is still fresh in our minds. Li Yichen is not necessarily a special talent, but he is slow and difficult to cooperate with others. Bao Xiu Tuo is also a capable player, but he lacks change and is not good at using it. However, these two have backup qualifications. Wan Xianghua's left wing is better than Ge Linbo's, which cannot be denied. Although Ya Erjie is also competing with him, he is still slightly inferior. His future selection can be predicted. Zhong Yongshen should be on the right wing. Fu En is indeed likable, but he still needs to be honed.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Game's Progression <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The whistle blew to start the game, but Team B was not complete, with one player missing. After conceding a goal, Chen Zhenxiang arrived to answer the call. The situation was that Team A would definitely take the lead, and then Team B would recover. This happened again and again. In the first half, the autumn colors were evenly divided, with each side scoring three goals. After reaching four to four, Team B, in difficult circumstances, scored two more goals in a row, winning by a score of six to four, which was not easy.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Wind and Clouds Change <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, Team B greatly improved. Bao Seyilie was especially active. Not long after the kickoff, the center left and right forwards had both arrived at Team A's goal. However, Bao Xiu Tuo's shot missed the target and hit the post behind. Ge Linbo entered from the left, and the goalkeeper personally saved it. The ball was obtained by Bao Xiu Tuo. At that time, only the goalkeeper was in front, and he missed it again, sending it too high. At ten minutes, Fa Fanxiao, who replaced Ya Erjie, was also frequently active on the right. Mai Da underestimated the enemy and advanced ahead, so he passed the ball to the left, and Ge Linbo passed it to the front of the goal. Bao Xiu Tuo identified the target and scored a goal, taking the lead with a score of four to three. Wan Xianghua passed the ball twice in a row, but Sun Jinshun missed one, and Ke Lasha's shot went wide. Wan then used the corner kick to pass the ball to the front of the goal, and Li hit the goal post, bouncing back into the crowd. Zhong Yongshen and Ke Lasha rode in tandem,挟骑入網, making it four to four. After that, Jiang Shanjing kicked Sun Jinshun and was warned. Ma Shaner suddenly sneaked into the enemy's goal, raised his foot and shot, hitting the post and falling in front of the goal. Chen Jiaqiu's foot was skillful, and he succeeded immediately, taking the lead again with a score of five to four. In the last five minutes, Fa Fanxiao was unsupervised and moved freely, letting his horse rush into the heart of the area. Bao Xiu Tuo headed it halfway, and it fell into the net, resulting in a score of six to four, and Team B won.</p>

Qiu Gongwei won the second prize and received a full-year subscription to Huamei Monthly. A total of ten people won the third prize, each receiving a half-year subscription to Huamei Monthly.

<h3 id="e224">Record of Cultural Construction Symposium <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhanen, Ou Yuanhuai and others all expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Ten professors who signed the "Ten Declarations" held the first cultural construction symposium at the Central Society on Weihaiwei Road in this city at 5 pm on the 19th of this month. About 30 people attended. They took their seats at 5 pm and began talking at 6 pm. The meeting ended at 9 pm. All the attendees expressed brief and insightful opinions. Those who spoke knew everything and said everything, and those who listened listened attentively with open minds. The hosts and guests had extremely pleasant feelings. The contents of the meeting and symposium were recorded by stenographers from Bingxun Stenography Agency and the Chinese Stenography Society. Half of them took Chinese records, and half of them were translators. In a short time, a huge volume was obtained, which will be disclosed in the future, and there will be a grand view. The following is a brief record of the situation on that day:</p>
<p>Attendees: From the ten professors' side, He Bingsong, Zhen Xinyong, Sun Hanbing, Fan Zhongyun, Zhang Yi, and Wang Xinming attended. The guests were Liu Zhanen, Shu Xincheng, Shen Yinmo, Jin Tongyin, Huang Renzhi, Li Haoran, Zhu Xinong, Ni Wenzhou, Li Zhaohuan, Wu Lifu, Li Maimai, Ye Qing, Fu Donghua, Tao Baichuan, Tai Shuangqiu, Zhang Sumin, Wu Zijing, He Xiya, Shi Guogang, Yu Songhua, Xie Jiagan, Ou Yuanhuai, and Yu Chenghuan.</p>
<p>Report on the progress: The ten professors elected He Bingsong as chairman. He immediately stood up and reported on the progress of the declaration and the work that he wanted to do in the future. He hoped that the cultural pioneers attending the meeting would express their unique opinions and give strong guidance. Finally, he also reported on the criticisms of the "Ten Declarations" by the opinion circles in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, and Hangzhou. After the report, he invited the guests to express their opinions.</p>
<p>Symposium situation: Many guests expressed their opinions that day. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) Liu Zhanen said that the words "China is gone" in the declaration are inevitably pessimistic. It must be known that a nation without self-confidence will perish, and there is no room for this pessimism. (2) Ou Yuanhuai said that China's culture today is a culture that is neither Chinese nor Western. In the future, the three transformations should be the highest principles, that is, the principles of scientification, standardization, and generalization. (3) Shen Yinmo said that he agreed with all the principles of the Ten Declarations, but how to make them concrete is the biggest problem. He hoped that the ten professors and the Chinese people would work hard on this in the future. (4) Yu Chenghuan said that the construction of China's local culture should be based on the countryside in order to be worthy of the name. (5) Jin Tongyin said that the first paragraph of the declaration is a diagnosis of China's diseases, the second paragraph describes the progress of treatment, and the third paragraph indicates the direction of future treatment. Now, I sincerely hope that the ten professors and those engaged in cultural undertakings can follow this direction and do some work of prescribing the right medicine. (6) Ni Wenzhou said that although the Ten Declarations only have abstract theories, they are a very effective medicine in opposing the inferiority complex of blindly following Western culture and discarding the exaggeration of clinging to the old feudal culture of China. At least it also has the value of psychological self-healing in medicine. (7) Shi Guogang said that cultural construction is not a matter for a few people, and the masses of cultural workers should be responsible for it together. (8) Li Zhaohuan said that China lacks the spirit of science the most, so the future cultural construction should be based on scientification as a prerequisite. (9) Ye Qing said that the Ten Declarations recognize that the needs of this time and place are the foundation of China's local culture. This is an attempt to make modern China truly modern. This attempt is to demand the modernization of China. (10) Fu Donghua said that it is useless to only talk about principles. After setting the principles, we must come up with concrete plans and be able to implement concrete methods in order to be useful. (11) Huang Renzhi said that to build a China-based culture, we should study the content of Chinese culture, analyze it carefully, and then determine the direction of taking and giving. (12) Li Haoran said that to solve the problem of China's cultural construction, we must first seek the balanced development of cities and villages, and education should not be exclusively for the rich. In today's villages and the poor being excluded from cultural life, we should pay attention to the issue of balanced development. (13) Zhu Yinong said that the three words "not sticking to the old" are inappropriate. I am against completely not sticking to the old. It should be "not clinging to the ancients." (14) Tao Baichuan said that the "not sticking to the old" in the declaration does have problems. As for "not blindly following," although it is an unbreakable principle, there must be concrete expressions in order to avoid the disease of superficiality. If the ten professors can have a supplementary and concrete declaration to show people the highest guiding principles, that would be the best thing. In addition, I advocate taking the Three People's Principles as the highest principle of cultural construction, and not adopting the experimental approach, because China's country and nation have been sacrificed by many erroneous experiments. The melon of Huangtai cannot be picked again and again, and no more erroneous experiments are allowed. (15) Tai Shuangqiu said that it is not known what the "needs of this time and place" referred to in the declaration are, but I think there are the needs of the majority and the needs of the minority, urgent needs and non-urgent needs. Cultural activists should take the urgent needs of the majority as needs. According to this view, cultural construction should be based on the Principle of People's Livelihood and aimed at national rejuvenation. (16) Zhang Sumin said that we should climb high from low and travel far from near. Now we should start with ourselves and spread to the masses to create a trend of the times. I not only hope that China has a local culture, but also hope that this local culture can be exported overseas. (17) Wu Lifu said that the theory of the Ten Declarations is beautiful, but we hope that this declaration is not just a theory of flowery language, but a plan to solve practical problems. (18) He Xiya said that I hope to have three points. The first point is to get rid of the three kinds of cowardly, conservative, and submissive psychology of fearing foreign culture, complaining about foreign culture, and blindly worshiping foreign culture. The first point is to take saving the nation as the prerequisite and backbone of cultural construction. The third point is that we must take the realization of the Three People's Principles in politics as the leading principle in politics and economy, promote the New Life Movement as the leading principle in social life, and pursue and create academic experience, knowledge, and skills that adapt to the times and national conditions as the leadership of thought, so that the three forces can be combined into one. Then we can nurture a brand-new Chinese local culture, that is, then we can make the Chinese people of the future both modern Chinese and not forget that they are Chinese people in the present world. (19) Li Maimai said that we should accept Europeanization and affirmatively declare the culture of capitalism. (20) Wu Zijing said that the biggest shortcoming of Chinese society is the lack of "obedience." I said that doing less empty talk and more practical things is also a shortcoming in China. Now we have two requirements: one is to require discipline, and the other is to require working hard in a down-to-earth manner. (21) Xie Yu said that cultural construction should be based on the Three People's Principles. The New Life Movement is a product of the Three People's Principles, and implementing the New Life Movement is a part of implementing the Three People's Principles. In addition, Yu Songhua made a written statement, which will not be repeated here.</p>

<p>Wang Xie Changda, the founder of Zhenhua Girls' Middle School in Suzhou, also founded the Foot Emancipation Society, organized women's public welfare groups, and participated in the women's Northern Expeditionary Army. She made great contributions. Unfortunately, she passed away last month at the age of 86. Initiated by Zhang Zhongren and other people from all walks of life in Suzhou, a memorial service was held at Zhenhua Girls' Middle School yesterday afternoon (the 19th). The layout was solemn, and the ceremony was grand. More than a thousand Chinese and foreign guests attended. Important figures such as Cai Yuanpei (a student of the deceased), Zhang Yuanji, Yang Qianli, Wang Diancun, Meng Xiancheng, Yu Qingtang, and the representative of the Engineering Research Institute of the Academia Sinica all came to Suzhou from afar to participate and gave speeches. Zhang Taiyan, Li Yinquan, Zhang Yipeng, and leaders of various agencies, schools, and organizations in Suzhou all attended. The event was extremely mourned. All circles in the country sent gifts and cash, which were all used for scholarships. Many eulogies and elegiac couplets were received.</p>

<p>It has been reported in the previous newspaper that the Jiangxi Senior Vocational School and Jiangxi Middle School in Nanshi, Shanghai, applied to the Municipal Education Bureau for registration, and the bureau has approved it. It is now heard that since the school was registered, all equipment has been expanded. They are currently raising large sums of money to build a practical workshop. It is said that once the designs are completed, they will be put out to tender.</p>

<p>Shenmei Girls' Middle School on Baige Road in this city has always adhered to the sole purpose of sacrificing for education and working hard for society. In daily management, it is considered that true education is well managed, and it has long been deeply trusted by the general public. Recently, the school, in view of the economic downturn and the increasing number of students dropping out of school, decided to increase the number of free places in the primary and secondary school departments from the next semester, so that the children of poor families can have the opportunity to go to school. Once the news was announced, there was a rush to register and ask for information, and there was a problem of overcrowding. However, the school, based on its consistent spirit of sacrifice, decided to further expand the number of places, so that those who are ambitious can achieve their wishes. The school's enrollment period is set for January 25th. The classes are: three grades in the junior high school department, two classes in the national specialization department, one class in the elective women's weekday class, various grades in the elementary school department, and one class in kindergarten.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Current Status of the New Medical Community in Zhenhai <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zheyun</p>
<p>(1) County Territory Zhenhai is located in the eastern corner of Zhejiang Province, bordering the sea to the east, Cixi to the north, and Yin County to the southwest. Although the county area is not very large, it is listed as a second-class county because of its rich products. Also, because it is located at the mouth of the sea, it is a necessary route for seagoing ships to Ningbo, and it is the hub of the gateway to eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, a customs station is set up. Also, because of its strategic location, it is an important place for national defense and provincial defense. Therefore, gun emplacements are installed. This is the Hulang Pass that was formerly known, and today it is called Zhenhai Pass.</p>
<p>(2) Transportation The current transportation situation in this county has greatly improved compared with two years ago. Waterways have steamships, gasoline ships, and sailing ships. Since the construction of the highway, there are many roads for cars to gradually pass passenger cars. In addition, postal and telecommunications can reach major towns, so transportation is still convenient.</p>
<p>(3) New Medicine This county is located by the sea, and half of the people's occupations are fishing, half are agriculture, and the other half are business. Also, many people go out to do business, such as in Shanghai, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the three northeastern provinces. There are many patients with venereal diseases, which can be called the local disease of this county. The viruses are mostly brought from overseas. Whether in the city or in the towns, the public has a lot of faith in new medicine. But in the belief, there are still superstitions. For example, after being diagnosed and treated in the new medicine, the purchased and prepared medicines are offered to the gods and Buddhas, and after confessing and kneeling, they are taken. This kind of behavior is also common in the intellectual community. They call it co-medical treatment by humans and gods. Old medicine has no power in this county.</p>
<p>(4) Hygiene Because there are no professionals responsible for the administration of hygiene in this county, apart from the general official articles of writing in compliance with the order, they do not know its importance. Therefore, there are no achievements to be said in the city or in the towns. The so-called promotion of national health and public health, these points must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>(5) Hospitals In the city, there is one county hospital, one private Tongze Hospital, and several other private clinics. In the towns, there is one public Tongyi Hospital in Zhuangshi, one Lingyan Public Hospital in Lingyan Township, one public Tongan Hospital in Daqi, one private Lujiang Hospital in Chaiqiao, one private hospital in Xiaogang, one private Jintang Hospital in Jintang, and several other individual practitioners scattered in various towns. But there are no church hospitals. Among them, the equipment of Tongyi Hospital in Zhuangshi is the best. Second, there are Tongan Hospital in Daqi, Lingyan Public Hospital, Private Tongze Hospital, and County Hospital.</p>
<p>(6) Charitable Institutions (1) County Hospital (2) Daqi Tongan Hospital (3) Zhuangshi Tongyi Hospital (4) Lingyan Public Hospital. The above four hospitals are public, so they have a charitable nature. There is a free clinic for the poor and sick. Those who hold the hospital's free ticket will not be charged for medical expenses during outpatient hours. During the epidemic, the above four hospitals have temporary epidemic hospitals attached, but all have to charge for medicine. This is all due to financial reasons, so it is difficult to achieve good results. I should ask the major philanthropists of this county to donate more and generously help the above four hospitals.</p>
<p>(7) Doctor Level The qualifications of doctors practicing in this county can be roughly divided into three: (1) graduates from Zhejiang Provincial Medical College, (2) graduates from major hospitals, and (3) graduates from Shanghai Southeast Medical College. The total number of doctors in the county is about fifty or sixty. Doctors have good moral concepts, no factional divisions, and no advertising to attract patients.</p>
<p>(8) Obstetrics The public has a lot of faith in new medicine for delivery, but most of them go home immediately after giving birth in the hospital without staying. Among them, the above four charitable organizations charge lower fees, but there is no establishment of a civilian obstetrics department in this county, which is a disadvantage.</p>
<p>(9) New Medical Groups There are no formal organizations such as doctors' associations for new medicine in this county, and there is no publicity of new medical publications. Although Doctor Cheng Yuzhi and others formed the Zhenhai New Medical Association in the autumn of last year, its purpose was to request the Ministry of Health to set up a doctor's refresher course to recruit doctors who had not registered due to the expiration of the regulations for flexible issuance of certificates. It is not an academic group.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Chinese Medicine and Hygiene in the Past Year (3) <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Haiming</p>
<p>Introduction—Medical Education—Medical Group Activities—Medical Disputes—Medical Publishing—Medical Inspection—Medical Construction—Military Medical Training—A Glimpse of the Old Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles—New Pharmaceutical Industry Trends—Rural Health Survey—Urban Health View—Conclusion</p>
<p>(10) New Pharmaceutical Industry Trends</p>
<p>In the past year, the new pharmaceutical industry operated by Chinese people has developed considerably. Although it is difficult to compare with the products of foreign companies such as Qianxin, Lilli, Kongshi, Xianling, and Baowei in terms of manufacturing, it is still very satisfying. Among the domestic pharmaceutical factories, the fastest progress is made by Xinya. In the spring of the 23rd year, Qiangji Company was newly established in Hankou, specializing in promoting Xinya's proprietary Chinese medicines. The business volume is increasing day by day, and it has penetrated into the hinterland of Sichuan, Hunan, Henan, and Jiangxi, which is enough to resist a part of foreign goods and recover a lot of profit. Products such as Minyi, Minsheng, and Xinyi are also mostly excellent. Although the annual sales volume of each factory is not detailed, which is a great regret, it is expected that in this year of disaster and drought, it may exceed other production and sales products.</p>
<p>As for manufacturing, the trend of domestic pharmaceutical factories is to try to imitate foreign goods as much as possible. For example, the "Chang Li Jun Zhi" produced by Xinya in the summer is an oral preparation in ampoules, which can be said to be a novel creation in the production of new medicines in China.</p>
<p>Regarding the promotion of new drugs, it seems that foreign manufacturers are the most concerned. The methods are novel and meaningful, and there are endless new ideas. For example, the "Womunadin" essay contest held by Qianxin Company in mid-October has done its best to publicize. It is expected that domestic manufacturers may follow suit. However, the psychology of merchants liking counterfeiting has become a common problem. In recent years, there are still many new drug advertisements that ignore the facts and exaggerate the propaganda. Our health authorities need to pay active attention to it.</p>
<p>After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, in the spring of the 23rd year, Russian medicines were once dumped in the Chinese market. To this day, many raw materials for medicines are still Russian goods, which is also worth noting.</p>
<p>(11) Rural Health Survey</p>
<p>The September issue of the Chinese Journal of Medicine and Pharmacy in the 23rd year published an article by Mr. Li Ting'an entitled "Investigation Report on Rural Health in China", which describes the situation of rural health in China in detail and shows his thoughts. Mr. Li completed this article with the cooperation of Mr. Yao Xunyuan of the Ministry of Health, so it is very serious. The investigators include:</p>
<p>Hebei Province - (1) Qinghe Health Experimental Zone in Wanping County (2) Ding County</p>
<p>Beiping City - Xishan Rural Health Experimental Zone</p>
<p>Shandong Province - Longshan Health Experimental Zone in Licheng County</p>
<p>Anhui Province - Wujiang Farmers' Hospital in He County</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province - (1) Xiao County (2) Yancheng (3) Taixing County (4) Jurong County (5) Jiangning County (Tangshan Health Experimental Zone Office, Jiangning Town Health Office, etc. County Hospitals</p>
<p>Shanghai City - (1) Wusong (2) Gaoqiao (3) Jiangwan and other Rural Health Model Offices</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province - (1) Wuxing (2) Wukang and other County Hospitals</p>
<p>Guangdong Province - Guangzhou Family Promotion Association</p>
<p>According to the results of the survey, there are a total of seventeen places where rural health has been built in China. The lack of quantity is undoubtedly true; moreover, from the general situation obtained from the survey, there are about six impressions of its shortcomings:</p>
<p>First, the establishment has not been widespread. Second, the organization cannot be uniform. Third, it has not been long. Fourth, the funding is exhausted. Fifth, there is a lack of talent. Sixth, the work is monotonous, similar but not specialized. In a word, China's rural health cause is still in the experimental budding stage. Although the work in various places tends to focus on treatment and prevention, it is only because the establishment has not been widespread, and there are no good results to be said. Although, the Shanghai Gaoqiao Rural Health Model Experimental Zone and others have many good designs and performances, but they are only limited to one corner, so it goes without saying that our country's rural health is behind the Western countries. I can't help but deeply hope that my colleagues in the world and those responsible for health administration will actively seek the soundness of the rural health cause in order to seek universal development and determine the direction of future improvement.</p>
<p>The year with the most progress in the annual increase in the number of rural health agencies was the 22nd year of the Republic of China. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, only one place was added. How slow is it? We feel the importance of the rural health cause, and we cannot ignore the increase in the "quantity" of rural health construction. The following is a table of the annual increase in the number of rural health agencies, so as to clarify the outline.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(51) Relapsing Fever (Part 2)</p>
<p>(Question) After the fever subsides in a bout of relapsing fever, when will the fever return?</p>
<p>(Answer) Typically, after the fever subsides once, a second bout of fever occurs after five to seven days.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the condition like at this time?</p>
<p>(Answer) At this time, it is similar to the first bout of fever, with chills, shivering, and high fever; however, the severity and duration are reduced.</p>
<p>(Question) When will these repeated bouts of fever stop?</p>
<p>(Answer) Relapsing fever usually stops after the second or third bout; occasionally, there are fourth or fifth bouts. However, in these cases, the intervals become longer, the duration of the bouts becomes shorter, and the fever is lower.</p>
<p>(Question) Based on what you said, the course of relapsing fever is usually regular; but I wonder if there are any abnormal courses?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are also abnormal courses; however, they are rare.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the abnormal courses of relapsing fever?</p>
<p>(Answer) The abnormal courses of relapsing fever include fewer bouts, shorter duration, and sudden cessation. Some resemble malaria-like attacks. Others involve nervous system symptoms, or jaundice, bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes, vomiting blood, and bloody diarrhea. This particular condition is called biliary relapsing fever.</p>
<p>(Question) Do patients with relapsing fever experience complications?</p>
<p>(Answer) Various complications can occur.</p>
<p>(Question) Which complications are most likely to occur during the course of relapsing fever?</p>
<p>(Answer) In addition to bronchitis and bronchopneumonia, splenic infarction or splenic abscess can occur. This can lead to peritonitis, which is very dangerous.</p>
<p>(Question) What other complications are there?</p>
<p>(Answer) There can also be persistent nosebleeds, glandular inflammation, dysentery-like ulcers, hemorrhagic nephritis, and iritis. However, circulatory disorders are rare.</p>
<p>(Question) When we encounter a patient with relapsing fever, how should we diagnose it?</p>
<p>(Answer) To diagnose relapsing fever, one should pay attention to the onset of the illness, whether it begins with chills and shivering and a rapid onset of fever, splenomegaly, and recurrence of fever. In addition, the pathogenic spirochetes can be examined in the blood.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>(Question) What is the prognosis of this disease, good or bad?</p>
<p>(Answer) Despite the severity of the symptoms in relapsing fever, the mortality rate is very low, only about two to four percent.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the treatment for relapsing fever?</p>
<p>(Answer) At the beginning of the fever period, Salvarsan or Neosalvarsan (commonly known as 606 and 914), which are arsenic preparations, can be injected. Because the pathogen is a spirochete, these types of drugs are highly effective.</p>
<p>(Question) How should we prevent the spread of this disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) Because this disease is spread by blood-sucking insects, prevention methods involve eliminating bedbugs, lice, fleas, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Three Principles of the People and Medicine <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People are the only way to govern the country and bring peace to the world. Its essence is that it can be questioned by a hundred generations without doubt and will last for ten thousand years. There is no need for us to elaborate on this. What we want to talk about now is only about the medical aspect. In other words, it is the relationship between the Three Principles of the People and medicine.</p>
<p>(1) Nationalism</p>
<p>The meaning of the two words "nationalism" is too broad! On the surface, many revolutionary martyrs sacrificed countless blood, all for the revival of the nation. However, this goal has not been achieved to this day. How can the medical profession, being only one of a hundred professions, bear such a heavy responsibility? It must be known that this view is wrong. Although there is more than one way to revive the nation, the most fundamental and basic work must be undertaken by doctors. The ancients said in medical texts: "To strengthen a country, one must first strengthen its people." This saying has twelve points of profound truth. In other words, a healthy nation requires a healthy people. How can the people be healthy? This question cannot be solved with empty words; it must be done practically. The biggest enemy of health is disease. Therefore, the healthier a nation, the more diseases it has, and the higher the mortality rate. Why is this? It is simply because the people do not know about hygiene, so all kinds of infectious diseases follow one after another! When they are not sick, they have no preventative measures in place; and when they are sick, they often die needlessly because medical services are underdeveloped—such as insufficient distribution of doctors and too few hospitals. In this way, the nation naturally moves towards aging day by day! We only need to look at the advanced countries of the West. Isn't their level of civilization directly proportional to the health of their people? At the same time, aren't the development of their medical and hygiene undertakings directly proportional to their level of civilization and the health of their people? Understanding this point, one knows the relationship between medicine and the nation! Take our China, for example. The lack of vigor of the people can be said to have reached its extreme! But when one investigates the reasons, it is mostly due to disease and lack of hygiene. The widespread prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis is an obvious proof of this. As a result, weak genes are passed down, becoming weaker and weaker. At this time, the method of remedy can only be undertaken by doctors. How can we prevent diseases and eliminate germs? How can we popularize hygiene knowledge? All of this depends on the work and publicity of doctors. Our colleagues! Quickly take on this responsibility of reviving the nation!</p>
<p>The aggression of imperialists is intensifying day by day! It can almost be said that they are penetrating every hole and drilling every gap. Taking our medical community as an example, this phenomenon is becoming more and more obvious. What about foreign doctors? Their influence in China is growing day by day. What about foreign medicine? It is extraordinarily filling the markets! But the latter only invades our country's billions of dollars every year. As for the former? That is truly extremely dangerous! Entrusting the lives of our people to those who are not of our race is extremely dangerous for the future of the nation! Our only important task at this time is how to eliminate the influence of foreign doctors in China, to save the lives of our people from the brink of danger, and at the same time, how to imitate foreign medicines, resist foreign imports, and recover the country's losses even if it is only a fraction. I think this work is crucial to the safety of the nation and the rights of the country!</p>
<p>(2) Civil Rights</p>
<p>As long as one carefully studies the definition of the two words "civil rights," one can know that civil rights are a kind of right that everyone has. However, because of the nature of the profession, there is often a special right in addition to ordinary civil rights. In practice, this right is also one of civil rights, but it only applies to people in one profession and is not universal! This right for doctors is called medical rights. The medical laws and regulations of various countries often stipulate the special rights that doctors should enjoy in great detail. Because without this, doctors will feel thorny in their professional work! Our country is not like this. Society cannot understand the rights that doctors should have, and the doctors themselves? They also often do not know that they should enjoy special rights in their profession. As a result, medical rights are robbed, and even ordinary civil rights are gradually eroded! Looking at the medical disputes in the past year or two, one can know. Patients can file illegal lawsuits, and government agencies can make illegal arrests and illegal imprisonments. Isn't this evidence that even ordinary civil rights have been eroded? In order to maintain professional safety and to break through the surrounding bad environment, we must not only safeguard our due civil rights, but also strive for our due medical rights. We must use the spirit of developing civil rights to develop medical rights, which is one of the civil rights. Isn't this very much in line with the late Premier's Doctrine of Civil Rights?</p>
<p>(3) People's Livelihood</p>
<p>The first element of people's livelihood is production, which no one can object to. The level of productivity is controlled by the working class, which seems to have nothing to do with doctors. However, after careful study, it is not only related, but it can be said that the amount of productivity is almost indirectly controlled by doctors. Why is this? Productivity is directly proportional to the size of the population. Countries with large populations often have sufficient productivity. To have a large population, the mortality rate must be reduced. To reduce the mortality rate, the people must have strong physiques. How to make the people's physiques strong and how to reduce the mortality rate, we must ask our doctors! Therefore, the medical profession has a direct relationship with the nation and an indirect relationship with the people's livelihood. And this indirect relationship is no less important than the direct relationship!</p>
<p>Based on the above three points, it can be known that the medical profession has a deep relationship with the late Premier's Three Principles of the People! Now that we understand the relationship between the Three Principles of the People and ourselves, we must further study how to develop the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and how to undertake this major basic work. I want to tell the people of society not to regard medicine as a minor path and despise it, and our colleagues should not regard themselves as a minor path and ignore our natural duties and the human rights we should enjoy!</p>

<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(32) Scarlet Fever (Continued)</p>
<p>Pathogen—In this era of flourishing medicine, everyone has recognized that scarlet fever is an acute rash-like infectious disease, the same as measles, rubella, smallpox, chickenpox, and other diseases. Unfortunately, its real cause is still unknown. Although some researchers have reported the pathogenic bacteria of this disease, it has not yet been truly recognized by the medical community. However, judging from the results of streptococcal serum treatment of scarlet fever, the theory that streptococcus is the pathogenic bacteria of this disease seems to be closer to the truth.</p>
<p>Infectiousness—The infectiousness of this disease is particularly strong, especially when there is fever and during the recovery period. The chance of infection does not necessarily have to be from the patient's clothes, bedding, books, toys, etc. Sometimes, it can be transmitted simply by being in the same room with the patient for a short while. Its virus is mostly present in the patient's tissues, body fluids, secretions, and excretions. Therefore, the patient's blood, tears, nasal mucus, sputum, urine, feces, epithelial desquamation (during the recovery period), etc., all have the ability to transmit the disease.</p>
<p>Age—Children around five years old are most susceptible to this disease. People in their teens to twenties are also often infected. If they are over forty years old, it is difficult to be infected.</p>
<p>Port of entry for the virus—Mostly from the pharyngeal tonsils (commonly known as palatine tonsils).</p>
<p>Season of epidemic—This disease can be epidemic in all seasons in large cities with dense populations. However, it is most prevalent in autumn and winter.</p>
<p>Incubation period of scarlet fever—Approximately four to eight days. However, there are times when it is as short as one day or as long as two weeks.</p>
<p>Prodromal period of scarlet fever—The prodromal period of this disease is characterized by chills, shivering, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. At this time, the body temperature is mostly as high as 39 or 40 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Scarlet fever rash—The rash begins to appear the day after the prodromal period occurs, which is when the body temperature rises to its highest point. The skin rash that occurs in this disease has very unique characteristics compared to the skin rash that occurs in other acute rash-like infectious diseases. The rash is initially small, bright red spots that are densely distributed on the surface of the skin. These spots spread very quickly, so they can soon interconnect and merge into patches.

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(2) Treatment of Type A Pyorrhea Alveolaris</p>
<p>—Surgical Treatment—</p>
<p>(1) Scrape off tartar. Tartar is the main cause of this disease and must be scraped off. Special instruments must be used when scraping to avoid injuring the gums, periodontal membrane, and teeth.</p>
<p>(2) Extreme caution must be exercised when performing surgery to prevent hard tartar from flying into the eyes of the doctor or the patient.</p>
<p>(3) Before scraping tartar, the patient's mouth must be rinsed several times with a disinfectant to wash away the dirt in the mouth (commonly using cinnamon water with 2% alcohol).</p>
<p>(4) The tartar scraping operation must be performed in order. First scrape the teeth of a certain part, so that the tartar is completely scraped off, and then scrape the teeth of other parts. Do not scrape randomly. It is best to place various instruments on a special tray soaked in a palatable disinfectant.</p>
<p>(5) The pocket of this disease is very shallow, and the tartar is easier to scrape off. The scraping time is limited to one hour. After scraping, use silicon whetstone, orange tree bark, pumice, floss, and brushes to scrub. The teeth of this disease are not shaking and do not need to be fitted with appliances.</p>
<p>—Drug Treatment—</p>
<p>(1) After the tartar is scraped off, a disinfectant must be used to wash away the tartar debris and pumice powder scraped around the teeth. Wipe the affected area dry with a cotton roll, and then apply a suitable astringent (such as a mixed solution of Zinc phenolsulphonatic, potasufodidi lodi, mentholis, etc.) to the gingival area and interdental space. Keep it for a few minutes, and then rinse with a disinfectant. This treatment should be performed each time until cured.</p>
<p>(2) Patients must also pay attention to oral hygiene at the same time. Wash and rub the teeth and gums every day, and rinse with a disinfectant frequently.</p>
<p>(3) In recent years, the use of 5% Dichloramin-T dissolved in chlorocosane injected into the pocket has been quite effective.</p>
<p>(4) Astringent mouthwashes must not be used, because long-term use can interfere with the fermentation effect of saliva. If it must be used, it is best to make it into toothpaste and use it to brush the teeth and gums.</p>
<p>(3) Treatment of Type B Pyorrhea Alveolaris</p>
<p>—Surgical Treatment—</p>
<p>(1) If there is hard tartar, it must be completely scraped off and rinsed clean.</p>
<p>(2) If hard tartar is not easy to scrape off, chloroglucin_sulphuric acid can be applied to the deep part of the pocket first to make the tartar disintegrate and disperse, and then scrape it off.</p>
<p>(3) If there is no tartar, the pocket must also be washed and scraped clean before drug treatment can be performed.</p>
<p>(4) Too many teeth should not be treated at a time. About one to four teeth are the limit.</p>
<p>(5) If there are teeth that cannot be treated, they must be removed to avoid infecting other teeth.</p>
<p>(6) If the upper and lower teeth are not properly occluded, causing excessive pressure on a certain part of the teeth during chewing, measures must be taken to correct the occlusion. Smoothly grind the protruding and overly high occlusal surface with a whetstone, so that the entire occlusion is even. However, when grinding, the shape and beauty of all the teeth must be taken into account, and too much should not be ground off to avoid injuring the pulp.</p>
<p>(7) For those teeth whose pockets are very deep and the vitality of the pulp is weak, or those who need to be fitted with metal to firmly implant other shaking teeth, or those whose sensation is too sensitive, it is advisable to remove the pulp.</p>
<p>(8) Sometimes, various surgical procedures and drug treatments are performed, but the results are not good, and there is no effect, and the pocket still exists. At this time, the pocket is mostly deeper than five millimeters. In fact, there is no way to prevent its infection. The outer wall of the gums that form the pocket must be surgically opened to the bottom of the pocket, or cut into a V shape. Scrape off and wash away the internal tartar and toxins. For severe cases, the gums must be completely cut open, and then the dead bone of the alveolar bone and the granulation tissue of the affected area must be removed to achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p>—Drug Treatment—</p>
<p>(1) The astringent treatment used for type B pyorrhea alveolaris is the same as that for type A, but the treatment time is longer, and continuous treatment takes about two or three weeks.</p>
<p>(2) If you encounter a stubborn and difficult-to-treat purulent cyst with constant pus flow, the pus sac must be corroded with 125% to 50% phenolsuPhric acid (other acidic drugs cannot be used).</p>
<p>(3) Emetine treatment. Many buccal amebas (Endameba buccalis) and various parasites are often found in pyorrhea alveolaris pockets. Emetine treatment can be used to eliminate microorganisms and prevent suppuration. The following two emetine treatments are effective:</p>
<p>For subcutaneous injection, 0.5 centigram of emetine hydrochloride is prepared as a solution and injected subcutaneously into a suitable part of the body. Once a day. After about three or four days, inject again every one or two days. Buccal amebas can be eliminated in about six days.</p>
<p>Oral tablets. Take Alcresta lpecac Tablets orally three times a day, two tablets each time. Take with lukewarm water one hour before meals. After about five days of taking, you can stop taking it for seven days, and then continue to take it for five days. This tablet must be taken when surgical treatment is performed or before treatment. During the period of oral administration, it is fine if mild diarrhea symptoms appear. If diarrhea increases, you can stop taking it for three or four days. Ipecac tablets are not only strong in eliminating microorganisms, but also can treat lax and easily bleeding gums and inflammatory symptoms caused by local irritation.</p>
<p>(4) Ouinine and Urea hydroobloride treatment. Applying this medicine to the affected area can not only eliminate buccal amebas and spirochetes, but also has an acidic corrosive effect. When using this medicine, first wash the pocket clean and dry it. Then, put a pill made of this mixture on a glass slide, add two or three drops of distilled water, mix it into a paste, and send it into the pocket. Seal it temporarily with Vaseline ointment. After about five minutes, wash away the medicine in the pocket with warm water and scrape it clean. After using this medicine, it is best to use a corrosive to eliminate granulation tissue in the affected area. You can use Copper Sulpbate and 8% Zinc Cbloride made into a thick paste. After washing and drying the pocket, insert the paste into the pocket and rub it lightly to allow the medicine to penetrate into the bottom of the pocket. Then use Vaseline or (Chloro_percha·) solution to temporarily seal the mouth of the pocket, and then apply iodine to all the gums. After three or four days, perform the same treatment again. It should be cured in about three to five times. If the pocket has not shrunk at this time, it will heal. Then it must be removed surgically.</p>
<p>(5) If all kinds of drug treatments are ineffective, then surgical removal can only be effective.</p>
<p>—Appliance Fitting Treatment—</p>
<p>In addition to surgical treatment and drug treatment, very shaking teeth must be firmly implanted by using appliance fitting method. The so-called appliance fitting method is nothing more than the following types, namely gold crowns, bridge teeth, gold inlays, gold veneers, and various metal retainers. It is a method of fixing shaking teeth with appliances.</p>

<p>(6) X-ray Diagnosis</p>
<p>In today's society, there is a very popular old saying that is often used to praise doctors, called: "Penetrating insight into the crux of the problem." This is of course an exaggeration, and even those who have experienced it feel the same way; but if it is used to express the value of X-rays in diagnosis, it is no more appropriate! The author dares to say that, apart from the pathological anatomy aspect, the recognition of the nature of this disease is undoubtedly second to none due to it. It is true that the physical examination methods mentioned above, such as auscultation and percussion, are indeed similar to it in recognizing the current symptoms. However, physical examination is only an indirect procedure, and whether the technical training is proficient is a major difference; to put it another way, even if this difficulty is completely avoided, the range that it can reach is also a certain distance. If the location of the lesion is too far from the lung surface, there is absolutely no way. It is not like X-ray examination, which only needs to be fluoroscoped, and everything about the size, density, and form of the lesion can be seen at a glance. Therefore, its application in this disease is that almost every patient should undergo this examination procedure; even people who are suspected of having this disease mostly use the results of this aspect as the final confirmation.</p>
<p>What principle is X-ray based on when applied to medical diagnosis? The speculation of ordinary people is that it is used to view the internal organs with a mirror, which is completely hearsay and meaningless. We must know that X-rays have great penetrating power, which is certainly no exception for the human body; in addition, it can make objects with fluorescent function, such as Barium_platinCyarun, emit fluorescence. If you place a Barium_platinCyarun plate (i.e., fluoroscopy plate) in front of an X-ray beam, you can see the bright green phosphorescence emitted. If the human body is placed in between, then because of the different properties of various objects, different shades of influence will appear; like blood and bones show dark shadows, and muscles show light shadows. The lungs are organs containing air tissue, so X-rays can pass through and show the lung field on the transparent plate. Therefore, we can also check the pathological tissue and the existence of foreign objects according to the density of the shadow.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Not a Grievance <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Xi He</p>
<p>The Japanese writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa wrote for many years, and then one day, as if he were mad, he wrote in a book: "Why do we engage in literature?"</p>
<p>This question may sound ridiculous at first, but it contains great wisdom, and it will give you endless and profound aftertaste. We work diligently every day, studying "literary" books at our desks, and writing down our own feelings, but we lack an opportunity to sincerely reflect on this activity. Once we hear someone else point it out, we suddenly realize as if waking from a dream that these are actually just the most superficial and ordinary principles, which few of us have ever uncovered. In this short life, perhaps some people will learn and decide on a turning point in their lives, while others will continue to read and write, and when their great opportunity arrives, they will be filled with regret, or perhaps they will die in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>Indeed, why do we engage in literature?</p>
<p>According to the French philosopher Voltaire, he wrote to express what he thought, but this answer is too mysterious. Arishima Takeo said that he wrote for four purposes: first, for loneliness; second, for love; third, for the desire to love; and fourth, for the desire to spur on his own life. This answer is more to the point, but besides writing, aren't there more ways to achieve his ideals? Writing morning and night, taking literature, which people take least seriously, as the foundation of one's entire life, and presumptuously trying to clarify the world with a three-inch writing brush—this idea is truly adorned with the colors of Don Quixote. It's hard to imagine that someone with Arishima's courage could be so ignorant in this respect.</p>
<p>Just look at history vertically and at various ethnic groups horizontally. Aren't countless intelligent and wise people learning literature and writing there? Their ideals are different, and of course their writing goals are also different. Take our country as an example. Some write to pass on their names, some write to advance their careers, some write to get稿费, some write to get love letters from women after publication, some write to boast about their hometown, some write to vent that "smoke-like sorrow," some write to praise each other, and ultimately, there are plenty of people who sing for losing money, as Ruskin said. Of course, there are also some who write seriously, wanting to use literature to shout out their ideals and pursue their longing for light, but besides "writing," what exactly do they accomplish?</p>
<p>Here, I am not denying the usefulness of literature. Literature is a means of organizing life and can have a significant impact on society. Turgenev's "A Sportsman's Sketches" promoting the emancipation of serfs is the best example of this, but my point is that a person who truly understands life does not engage in writing white words on black paper. He despises all trivial activities and uses his entire life to write the great book of "history." He may never pick up a pen in his life, but the achievements he makes in silence are enough to make these so-called "literary figures" sweat with shame!</p>
<p>Once we see such a rich and beautiful life, then we, the people who play with the magic of words, who use new skills to earn a living, who search for chapters and extract sentences, who spread out flowery language, and who emit smoke-like fantasies, are still shamelessly saying that we are the noblest people in the world, which can be said to be somewhat thick-skinned!</p>
<p>Listen to Bazarov's words in Turgenev's book:</p>
<p>—Russia needs me... no, obviously, it has no such need. Who is needed? Shoemakers, tailors, butchers... selling meat to people... butchers...</p>
<p>A literary person can be made or not made, someone has already said that before me, but my point is, if we only write some boring things, then it is better to be a shoemaker, a tailor, or a butcher. Even if we write, we must avoid being called a "literary person" by a certain group of people, which is not a very pleasant term.</p>
<h3 id="e240">A Record of Crossing the Ridge on a Snowy Night (Part 1) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Xian He</p>
<p>It was already dark, but we still had to walk, which was truly disheartening. Even though we were walking quickly, the cold air of the deep mountains was sharply attacking from all directions, making us feel not a bit warmer, but even colder and unbearable. The wind was howling, its violent sound seeming to come from the dark sky, or as if it were rolling up from the cold valleys of the deep mountains. We only felt waves of阴寒, cutting into our bones like knives, but we couldn't discern the wind direction.</p>
<p>There was originally spring water in the mountain stream, flowing tirelessly day and night, passing through the trees and rocks. But at this time, it was also frozen, quietly and calmly, and we couldn't hear its low, gentle, murmuring song. Of course, the birds had also disappeared. The mountains floated in the heavy, turbid clouds,巍巍floating, as if the clouds couldn't bear their weight and were in danger of falling down at any moment. Thinking of that kind of mountain collapse, the earth-shattering sound, we all felt a chill, as if the ground was already shaking and spinning.</p>
<p>Crossing the ridge was especially frightening. The two upright mountain ridges were simply like two insurmountable, towering cliffs. It got deeper and deeper, narrower and narrower. You could only take one step at a time, never knowing if the place you stepped on next was safe ground or an abyss leading to your death. But discouragement was not an option. You could only move your feet firmly on the craggy rocks with a heart full of terror, not looking back or forward, because looking forward was clouds and fog, and looking back was also clouds and fog. Where exactly would it lead you, and who could know?</p>
<p>Most of the jungles along the ridge were old pine trees, dark and鬱鬰, and even in the deep, thick night fog, you could vaguely see the edges. The sky hung above the jungles, cold and lonely, seemingly clinging tightly to the treetops of the old pine trees. Apart from the difference in shade, there was no other boundary. I thought that on a clear night, the clear moonlight would shine on this蓊鬰, evergreen forest. When the mountain breeze blew, it would sound like surging waves everywhere, and the picturesque shadows of the pine branches would move everywhere, distinctly black and white. That kind of scene must be very poetic.</p>
<p>But surrounded by clouds and darkness, in this cold and freezing deep mountain, the pine wind was like the roaring of a violent tiger, the mournful cries of an ape, and the noisy howling of wolves. All poetic meaning had completely disappeared, leaving only terror,阴森, a kind of non-human, demon's bloody roar. Even when the cold wind blew a little lighter, they also lowered their voices a little, but it was still not as gentle and charming as when the sky was clear and the breeze was blowing. Nor was it majestic or cheerful. It echoed the cold wind, shouting and cheering, and that kind of violence would simply make one's teeth chill at the mere thought of it.</p>
<p>The road was very winding, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right. Under our feet were all very sharp stones, and if we weren't wearing shoes, we would surely be cut until our skin was broken and bleeding. Sometimes it was so winding that it would simply lead you into some kind of mountain cave. Going in was not an option, and retreating was not an option. All around were rocks, dead grass, and dirty, frozen mud. If there were also stones pressing down on your head, it would be so dark that you could only grope around, and it would be a great blessing if you didn't break your head or scrape off your nose. Even if there was a stone crevice above your head, the light that shone in was very weak and blurry, and the wind also blew in, and the snow also drifted in, making it even colder than in complete darkness. Walking on steep slopes was especially difficult because the accumulated snow was very slippery, and a single tremor of the heart could lead to the danger of being smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>The thick fog gradually receded into苍白. Before, it was all pitch black, but now it was灰茫day. The wind was blowing very hard, and snowflakes began to fall. We held our heads in our hands, but the snowflakes still floated into our collars and drilled into our hearts. We were frozen stiff, and even shaking was unsuccessful, because our skin had all solidified and would not contract, and our bones were as hard as plaster models and would not bend. All over our bodies, we only felt a pain that pierced our lungs, seeming numb and seeming awake. A vague terror about ghosts and beasts rose like fog into our hearts, surging all the way up to our throats, suffocating our breath and hindering our thoughts. The whole world was spinning before our eyes and around us, and our feet seemed to be on top of a bottomless abyss that had just fallen in.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Skeptics in China <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Lai</p>
<p>"The world is a big scam; life is a game; great poets, great writers... they are all big liars..." For many years, such teachings that emphasize skepticism to the extreme have been pouring into the blood of every young person like a torrent in literary production, theatrical performances, family admonitions, and mutual encouragement among friends. Thus, the younger generation of us is immersed in this atmosphere of skepticism, growing up, and rejoicing in our own "sophistication."</p>
<p>"Innocence" has become another name for "stupidity."</p>
<p>This terrifying phenomenon is deepening and expanding day by day, making me unable to help but think of what Arzibashev, the author of "Sanin," said through the mouth of a character in the book: "...If only my death could save humanity, I would be willing to die bearing the cross... but there is nothing in this world worth dying for..." (The general idea is like this) The archetype of skepticism, successfully emphasized in Arzibashev's writing, is widely present in China today.</p>
<p>Naturally, the mass production of skeptics has its roots in objective social conditions. Therefore, we can encounter many young people in the dance halls and bars of the city... using whiskey, women... to pass their every precious day, and they are successful as a philosophy of life to escape reality.</p>
<p>Now, if someone explains this phenomenon as "the decline of morality" or "the demise of ancient customs"... then we can only treat it as a dream that no one understands.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Parks and Me <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Di Zhou</p>
<p>I am a person who has no connection with parks. In the past, in other places, taking a morning walk on the long roads was one of my daily habits. Since my footsteps fell on the ground of this "international" commercial port, this habit has also disappeared because it could not be prolonged. But that doesn't mean I often go to parks as a result. On the contrary, except for special times, I only live in my house or rush about on the streets. Those who can connect with parks in their lives are only those who are comfortably well-off, or those above them.</p>
<p>The first park I came into contact with should be Hongkou Park. At that time, when I was very young, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness when I saw the团团yellow autumn leaves. I liked to stand alone, unfolding a broad vision, merging with the breath of nature little by little. I remember only going there three times in total, and the time seemed to be in the cold season. The mood of the last time was as if the heart and the scenery were one.</p>
<p>"Raging storm, come rolling in with the clouds! I expect, I look forward to,</p>
<p>I look forward to you bringing Byron's songs and the great power of the ancient Greek heroes!"</p>
<p>Singing such a song, my heart was hard to fill, as if a thousand kinds of emotions were expressed only in these two lines of song. In fact, the reason for forming such a mood at that time was not a deep understanding of society, which led to feeling something and thus worrying about the world and the country—but only being influenced by the literary content that was popular at that time, and giving rise to a dim vision of one's surroundings. —Even so, the indirect influence of the entire trend of society is undeniable.</p>
<p>About two years later, I went to Zhao Feng Park with a newly acquainted friend. It was a spring morning, and the warmth could already be felt in people's breath. The scenery in the park under the clear sky made me spread out my hands, as if falling into my mother's embrace, enjoying a moment of quiet rest. I thought, after heavy work, being able to come here and be comforted by nature for a while would restore fatigue! But thinking that those who could often come here were only gentlemen and ladies, and some drunken intellectuals, I felt empty and tired of the view of the tree trunks, the green buds, and the bright open space.</p>
<p>We started talking and immediately forgot about the surrounding scenery. Only the slightly sweet morning air constantly brewed new liquid of joy in my heart.</p>
<p>Shortly before this, I had entered the French Park. I was dragged there by someone, and I couldn't help but run there tastelesslessly. I didn't like that place. The "beautiful scenery" that was arranged gave people nothing but a sense of cliché and mediocrity. As for the Western children laughing in the cradle of paradise, their innocence, liveliness, and cuteness won the attention of general park visitors, but for me, they didn't arouse interest. What moved me slightly was the straight white path that connected Huanlong Road and led into the park, and the lush French parasol trees standing tall on both sides.</p>
<p>The most recent time I stepped into Zhao Feng Park was in the middle of spring this year. It had been three years since the previous time. The surface hadn't changed, just like the city it belonged to, but also like the city it belonged to, its inner essence had undergone a change. That was the triumphant faces of the Japanese. Men and women in Western-style clothes, smiling heartily, throwing simple volleyball-style balls. In addition, there were young people accompanying each other by the pool; middle-aged people, dragging canes, walking and talking in twos and threes. I thought: This phenomenon cannot be said to be unrelated to the expansion of Japanese power in this city. Obviously, even in the corner of leisure,木屐also showed her victorious posture with aggressive iron nails. I didn't stay long, quickly circled around, and left. This was for the same reason that I absolutely did not want to imprint my footprints on the French Park on the night of July 14th: I didn't like to witness other people's "威" and "glory."</p>
<p>Naturally, there are many birds and flowers in these parks, just as there are many ladies with施脂抹粉. But for me, they don't need to be seen with the eyes or heard with the ears, so there is no need to write about them with a pen. Recently, a friend came from the south and said that in City X, Jia, which was known for its parks throughout the country, only the rich姿 of nature was left, quietly enduring loneliness there. He said that the citizens of City X, for some reason, all didn't go there. After listening, I couldn't help but worry about the people in this "international" city. Perhaps one day, the parks here will also suddenly become desolate, and there will be朵朵株株"late summer roses" everywhere in the parks. (End)</p>

<p>Later, after my friend repeatedly proved and told her what a well-behaved person I was, never getting close to women, only wanting to broaden my horizons and see more things, that's why I brought them to see, and there was no other intention besides that. He also said some lies to compliment me, saying what a good person I was, how much knowledge I had, and how my mind was not bad, and explained that I had never used my position to find fault with others.</p>
<p>She put down her hand. This last lie seemed to touch her very much. A smile surfaced on her face, and she glanced at me, saying, "Then that's convenient for both of us, Director Li," and lay down on the炕surface and began to smoke. My friend closely followed and lay down opposite her.</p>
<p>This old friend of mine is not as honest as he used to be. He used to blush at the mention of women, but now, not only can he handle the affairs in front of him calmly, but he also teases women with vulgar and ugly words from time to time. The woman didn't avoid me, reaching out and touching him all over, and at the same time, he kept touching her.</p>
<p>"Is this probably the reason for the prosperity of private opium dens?"</p>
<p>I was thinking this when my friend tilted his head and asked me:</p>
<p>"How is it? This is a good place, right?"</p>
<p>After speaking, his eyes fell on the opium lamp in a daze.</p>
<p>The woman had already put an opium bubble on the opium pipe and handed it to my friend. He put it in his mouth and started smoking, and the opium pipe made a嗤啦嗤啦sound. The woman kept fiddling with the opium bubble with an opium needle.</p>
<p>"This is an interesting thing."</p>
<p>I watched for a while, and couldn't help but have this thought, but after he smoked three opium bubbles, the room was filled with heavy smoke, and I couldn't stand the smoke, and my nose couldn't stand the stimulation either. Honestly, I felt dizzy. I wasn't willing to suffer this innocent punishment in the room anymore, so I shouted:</p>
<p>"No, I can't stand it anymore! I have a headache! Do you have another room? Otherwise, I'll leave first."</p>
<p>"There is a place, there is a place, let's go to the east room."</p>
<p>My friend heard my urgent call and put down the opium pipe in his mouth, hurriedly saying, and I could guess what he meant: he wasn't afraid that I would leave first, leaving him alone, and it wouldn't be fun to walk alone; otherwise, he felt a little sorry for me, making me suffer this bit. He still wanted to say something, but the woman's words stopped him. She said:</p>
<p>"Xiao Ju, take Director Li to the east room and keep him company for a while."</p>

<h3 id="e245">A Glimpse into the State of Finances <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>(I) Causes: Internal and External</p>
<p>The financial panic in capitalist countries arises from two main causes. One is the intensification of their inherent contradictions; economic activity declines, resulting in a decrease in general tax revenues, leading to a shortfall in annual income. The other is the surge in their ambitions for external aggression, resulting in continuous and massive military expenditures, squandering the people's wealth on unproductive extravagances like guns, cannons and shipbuilding, thus inflating the state's budget. Simultaneously, there is a self-destructive effect of the internal system. The ruling classes in various countries, to safeguard the accumulation of their capital, use their political power to shift the burden of taxation onto the masses, and then, through means of using public funds for private gain, greatly increase expenditures on items such as relief funds, subsidies, and public works, in order to alleviate the general panic while accelerating the process of financial capital monopolization. Thus, on one hand, expenditures inflate; on the other hand, revenues sharply decrease, plunging the nation itself into impoverishment, reaching a tragic self-destructive state, and completing the process of financial panic.</p>
<p>However, in our country, the form of panic is naturally not entirely the same, but its severity far exceeds that of other nations. The origins of this state lie in other areas.</p>
<p>First: Our country is a semi-colonial nation, serving as a supplier of raw materials on one hand and absorbing excess commodities from capitalist countries worldwide on the other. When a surplus occurs in the global raw materials market, our international currency can no longer maintain its balance. Under a state of perennial trade deficits, the disintegration of the colonial economic structure is accelerated, and the national finances, parasitic upon this structure, are shaken from its foundation.</p>
<p>Second: During the process of military aggression by the great powers, they extorted huge reparations from us; and in the process of their economic aggression, they used investments and loans to shackle our throats with the iron chains of their financial capital. Under the heavy yoke of reparations and foreign debt, our national finances have been crushed.</p>
<p>Third: Our country has always been one with "wealth but no governance," and there are two reasons for this situation: one is the political disarray, which leads to long-term chaos in financial activities. The other is the poisoning effect of traditional thought. Chinese gentlemen have always looked down upon the study of financial management, with the saying "a gentleman does not speak of profit," and "rather have a thieving minister than a minister who hoards." Everyone has adopted this passive attitude, which has resulted in the unrestrained pursuit of private gain by "ministers who hoard." Consequently, even if there is governance, it is merely arbitrary extraction and arbitrary distribution. After accumulating such bad habits for so long, it is naturally more difficult to turn the situation around now.</p>
<p>Fourth: The rampant feudal forces have created political disunity, making it impossible to unify finances. The current situation may be said to have progressed considerably, but the remaining feudal forces have not been completely eliminated. Therefore, although there have been loud calls for reorganizing finances in recent years, these efforts are often hampered by various political constraints.</p>
<p>Fifth: Because the intellectual class looks down upon finance, there is a particular lack of specialists in financial management. At the same time, "auspicious" individuals all regard financial positions as a shortcut to wealth. Customs and tax officials all view their offices as lucrative positions, so there is rarely any integrity. Although the central government has repeatedly issued orders and decrees, there are still many who openly defy them in secret. For example, last year's exposed cases of corruption in land taxes were too numerous to count. Such as the joint embezzlement of tens of thousands of yuan of tax funds by the Songjiang County government; such as the more than ten land tax fraud cases in Shuyang, embezzling more than 100,000 yuan of national tax annually; such as the Suzhou collection director Mr. Zhu's embezzlement of more than 500,000 yuan of national taxes; and such as the joint contracting of registry clerks in Suining County to form corrupt groups, etc. These are only the publicly exposed cases; how many unexposed dark secrets are there? Therefore, with finances wasted and governance in disarray, it is no wonder that the financial panic is becoming more and more severe.</p>
<p>(II) Forms: Different Then and Now</p>
<p>In recent years, the central government has made every effort to reform finances and eliminate long-standing abuses, which is truly commendable. Within the past year, it has shown a particularly determined resolution to address the issue of tax system reform. Although there have been no significant achievements yet, it is enough to excite us common people. Because if the tax system can be reorganized and revitalized, then the most difficult problems in finance can be said to have been largely resolved. However, in reality, the difficulty of the problem lies outside of the system itself. The chaos and unfairness of the current tax system are the crystallization of the five major causes mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Our country is a semi-colonial nation, subject to years of internal and external erosion and disguised destruction. This situation has long plunged the nation into thorough poverty and complete bankruptcy. In recent years, the surplus in the world raw materials market has led to the bankruptcy of our country's rural economy. The urban economy, due to the hollowness of its lower foundation, has embarked on a path of disintegration. The financial economy, which is nurtured by the entire social economy, has reached a dead end. So, in the past, there was "wealth but no governance," but now we are almost in a state of "no wealth for governance." "Wealth but no governance" is just a matter of people; solving personnel problems is relatively easy. But "no wealth for governance" is a factual problem: and factual problems have difficulties beyond human power. The saying goes, "a clever wife cannot cook rice without rice," which is the most fatal thing. The current emphasis on the slogan of reforming the tax system may be due to this. If reforming the tax system is carried out because of this reason, does this truly demonstrate the significance of reforming the tax system? Let us not delve into that for now, and instead, let us first examine the financial background of reforming the tax system.</p>
<p>(III) Crisis at This Stage</p>
<p>The countermeasures we hear about today for balancing the budget always involve increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Does the currently advocated tax system reform represent the realization of this approach? Without going into that, we cannot help but doubt when we look at the current state of taxation in our country and its future.</p>
<p>Among our country's central tax revenues, customs duties are the primary source of funds. Since the Northeast customs duties were seized by the puppet state, their tax revenues still account for 52% of the total budget. In the previous year, when the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement expired, it was announced that the tariff rates on certain bulk imports would be slightly increased, so the amount of customs duties in the budget was further increased: its ratio to the total budget had increased to 53%. However, the actual revenue collected during the final accounting was still 5% less than the budget. However, in the past year, while the budget was being prepared, the budget amount of customs duties was increased. At the same time, the previous year's tariff agreement was abandoned, a new tariff agreement was re-issued, and the increased tariff rates were largely reduced to their previous state. This approach seems baffling at first glance, but those who understand the economic reason that two plus two is often less than three can also understand the depth of its intention. Reducing the tariff rates on bulk imports will inevitably increase the import volume of those goods, so it is hoped that the tax revenue from these goods will increase. As for whether this result will hit the domestic industry, that is another issue; but can this policy of robbing Peter to pay Paul be as successful as hoped? There is now evidence to prove it.</p>
<p>According to the national budget for the 23rd year, the projected revenue from customs duties was set at more than 380 million yuan, an increase of more than 30 million yuan compared to the projected amount of 350 million yuan in the 22nd year. However, according to the actual customs duties collected in the 23rd year (including the total revenue from import, export, transit, ship duties and surcharges, etc.) totaled 334.6 million yuan, a decrease of slightly less than 6 million yuan compared to the 339.5 million yuan in the 22nd year, and the amount of import duty reduction alone reached more than 3 million gold units, fully demonstrating the failure of the financial significance of last year's new import tariffs. The fiscal year for tariff accounting is different from the calendar year, but the recent sharp decline in foreign trade has revealed the decline in general purchasing power: therefore, even if this indirect tax method is used to increase tax revenue, it will ultimately be in vain due to the shrinking room for shifting the burden. Now the projected amount of customs duties has been increased in the budget, and at the same time, it is widely reported that the import tariff will be revised again. How to revise it we do not know at present, but no matter what, unless there is a way to safeguard domestic industries and improve the national economy, any severe fiscal and tariff policy will not work.</p>
<p>Let's look at salt tax, which is also one of the financial resources on which the central government places infinite hope. After the Northeast salt tax was seized by the puppet state, the projected salt tax revenue for the 21st year once fell by more than 20 million yuan. Now that the Northeast has not been recovered, the projected salt tax revenue in the budget has gradually increased. For example, the budget for the 23rd year has exceeded the record before the loss of the Northeast, creating an unprecedented record. For example, the salt tax budget for the 20th year before the September 18th Incident was more than 160 million yuan, but in the 23rd year, it has soared to more than 190 million yuan. This sharp increase in revenue is naturally the result of increasing the burden of salt consumption for the people in the country. Japan seized our Northeast and seized our financial resources, so the people in the country must bear this responsibility and compensate for this loss. In order to maintain national finances, this is the inevitable obligation of the people of an invaded country. Unfortunately, salt is an indispensable necessity for the daily lives of all people, and increasing salt tax revenue means increasing the burden of salt consumption for the people, which also means increasing the burden of people's lives. Regardless of whether the current means of rectifying salt affairs is only changing the weight of salt, without increasing the tax rate. However, replacing the 13.1-tael market scale with the 16.8-tael Sima scale has actually made the change in the tax rate quite significant. The recent surge in salt prices is a clear example. Now we have also heard about the plan to unify the national salt tax rate. The disparity in salt tax rates in various parts of our country makes it necessary to strengthen unification. But we are worried that the unification method is just to raise the low tax rate to the level of the high tax rate. According to the current highest tax rate, some places levy 14-15 yuan per dan: while the low tax rate areas are only 3-4 yuan, so if this method is adopted. Wouldn't that mean that the salt burden of the people in the low tax rate areas will suddenly increase by four or five times? The public sale of salt was originally intended to prevent the monopoly of market prices by unscrupulous merchants, and at the same time, it also allowed the state to increase financial resources in this monopoly. But its fundamental stand. Should take into account both social people's livelihood and financial tax revenue, that is undoubtedly, but what about now?</p>
<p>In terms of national taxes, we should also mention the consolidated tax, which is also an important financial resource for the central government. Although it has not been established for a long time, its position in the budget has been expanding infinitely. Its main collection target is national industry. In fiscal science, in order to universally distribute the tax burden, this is originally a considerable method. Therefore, we do not care about its impact on the social economy, and in terms of the purpose of finance itself, is there room for placing infinite hope, relying on the increase in this consolidated tax revenue to help the development of finance? We know that the position of the consolidated tax in the budget has increased from 9% in the 20th year of the Republic of China to 15% now. This means that its importance has increased by about one time compared to before. The projected revenue for the 23rd year has been set at more than 117 million yuan, so an average of 9 million yuan should be collected every month to achieve this goal. But the fact is that the actual collection performance in the first eight months of last year averaged only more than 8.6 million yuan per month, and the revenue in July was only more than 6.4 million yuan. Therefore, in order to make up for the shortfall in the budget, the tax rate will naturally be increased again, so the increase in the yarn and powder consolidated tax rate has now become the central government's inevitable goal, and it is only a matter of time before it is implemented. But we know that this shortfall in actual revenue means that its tax rate has already exceeded the taxpayer's limit. In other words, it is already above the national tax-paying ability. Now if we still want to increase its tax rate, wouldn't it be committing the fallacy of reversing cause and effect?</p>
<p>The central government is like this, what about the local governments? Everyone knows that the only financial source for maintaining local finances is land tax. Now it is under the slogan of rural revitalization, this is the only right remedy. But what is the actual effect? Let's discuss it later. Here, let's take a look at the farmers' existing burden to know what the direction should be taken when reorganizing the local tax system? According to the survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, the tax burden of farmers has increased in recent years. Their statistical results show that the burden of farmers in 687 counties in 22 provinces across the country has increased greatly compared to before. The average tax rate for paddy fields in each province was 2.07% of the land price in the 20th year, 2.37% in the 21st year, and further increased to 2.68% in the 23rd year. As for the tax rate for dry land, its increase rate is even greater, from 2.36% of the land price in the 20th year to 2.5% in the 21st year, and further increased to 2.8% in the 23rd year. According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, it seems to be stipulated that only 1% of the land price should be collected. Are we now following this teaching and reducing taxes? Let's not ask for now. But in the midst of such an increase in the burden of farmers, can we solve the shortfall in local government revenue and expenditure? No, no, millions of facts tell us that the poverty of local finances is more severe than that of the central government. Taking the new budgets of the provinces in the 23rd year as an example, there is not a single province that is not in a state of huge deficit and emptiness. For example, Guangdong has a deficit of 50 million, Zhejiang has a deficit of 7 million, Anhui has a deficit of 5 million, Hebei has a deficit of 4 million, Gansu has a deficit of 3 million, Jiangsu has a deficit of 3 million, and Fujian, Hunan, Chahar and other provinces each have deficits of 2-3 million, and others are not known.</p>
<p>Under this huge deficit, what is their way to make it up? It is to issue public bonds. Localities that find the issuance of public bonds cumbersome simply implement loans. The names of the public bonds issued in various places and the reasons for the loans raised are all very grand and high-sounding. For example, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangxi have issued local public bonds, Hubei, Guangdong, and Xinjiang have issued financial public bonds or treasury bills, and Jiangsu, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, etc. have raised new debts in the name of construction or water control and road construction. There are also silk cocoon loans in Zhejiang and Shandong, warehouse loans in Zhejiang and Jiangsu, and disaster relief public bonds in Hubei, Anhui, and Hunan. According to sporadic reports, the total amount of new local public bonds and new loans issued and issued by various provinces in the past year totaled more than 250 million yuan. The so-called public bonds and the so-called loans are the prelude to increasing taxes. Because their principal and interest payments are all borne by the masses, and they have also increased the burden of interest payments for the people, and have increased a "profit" for the banks and financial groups to obtain from the people.</p>
<p>(IV) What Strategy to Improve the Future</p>
<p>If we want to ask the question of "what is the best way to improve this situation?" then the frank answer is "earnestly reduce expenditure."</p>
<p>We should know that although the finances of various countries rely on taxes as their main support, none are as reliant as ours! For example, let's take a look at the examples of the financial budgets of various countries in 1934-1935; in the UK, out of 700 million pounds of revenue, tax revenue is estimated at more than 660 million pounds, accounting for 94%, which is considered the largest. In the United States, out of more than 4.4 billion US dollars, tax revenue accounts for more than 3.79 billion yuan, accounting for 84%, which can be listed as second. The third is Germany, in the revenue of 6.5 billion marks, taxes account for 5.2 billion, accounting for 89%. The next is France, the total revenue is 50 billion francs, and the tax revenue is 40 billion francs, accounting for 80%. As for Soviet Russia, it is simply very small. The total budget reaches more than 48.88 billion rubles, and tax revenue is only more than 33 billion, accounting for only 73%. Moreover, these taxes are all collected from the socialized economic sector, and the taxes directly collected from the people are only more than 2 billion rubles. But look at us! Then, in each year's total budget, taxes always account for more than 95% of the total amount. The French and Japanese cabinets are often overthrown by parliament for proposing tax increase proposals. Their national economies are hundreds of times better than ours, and they still express that tax policies are too harsh on the people, let alone us?</p>
<p>However, the facts are in front of us. In this situation of internal and external troubles, we must make plans to resist the strong and defend against violence. Therefore, we must have sufficient financial capital to engage in various constructions and necessary preparations. However, unless the social economy recovers a little, any empty talk is worthless. Under this dilemma, this contradictory situation, we should naturally implement a dual-track system, that is, on the one hand, we should stand on the standpoint of relieving the people's suffering, reorganize the tax system, increase tax revenue by eliminating long-standing abuses, and nurture the people by distributing the tax burden equally. If we can distribute the tax burden equally, reduce waste, and eliminate long-standing abuses, then although the tax burden of the people may not be reduced, at least they can get a sense of fairness and be sincerely convinced. This is also meaningful for finances, and can achieve the purpose of increasing revenue. But looking at the facts mentioned above, how much revenue can be increased, the hope is very limited! Therefore, the important thing is to cut spending and earnestly reduce expenditure! In other words, it is "live within your means." The author has repeatedly advocated this in this publication.</p>
<p>Reducing expenditure is also one of the slogans that our country's authorities are chanting today, but how it is actually done, we have to take a look at.</p>
<p>The two major floods in our country's financial expenditure are military expenditure and debt service. The expenditure of these two items constantly consumes the entire three major tax revenues of the central government. Therefore, our country's financial budget is actually the expenditure budget of military expenditure and debt service. Debt service is the root cause of the disease planted in peacetime; now we can only taste the bitter fruit, because the perennial revenue and expenditure have not been enough, and we have only borrowed and repaid debts, so the deeper we get into it, the inevitable result. In the past, we drank poison to quench our thirst, only caring about the present and not thinking about the future: now there is no way to think about it, and there is no way to reduce expenditure, so there is no need to talk about it.</p>
<p>As for military expenditure, in the past, it was for resisting Japan and suppressing bandits. Suppressing external aggression and pacifying internal unrest were carried out at the same time, and the expansion of military expenditure was originally an unavoidable necessity. Now the lost land has not been recovered, and the powerful enemy is still invading. However, the work of suppressing bandits is said to be coming to an end. But in order to make the suppression of bandits successful, President Chiang has long said that we should spend 30% on military affairs and 70% on politics. If we do not earnestly restore the bandit areas today, the future troubles will still be difficult to eliminate. In this way, today's administrative expenses will naturally have a considerable increase compared to before.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, the new budget for the 23rd year has not achieved the principle of "reducing expenditure," which is undeniable. We don't need to say anything else, just looking at the fact that financial expenses still account for more than 9% of the total expenditure, we can imagine it. If we remove debt service, military expenditure, current affairs expenses, and subsidies from the total expenditure, then financial and precautionary expenses account for more than 45% of the central government's various administrative expenses, which is unprecedented in any country in the world. According to the facts, the four northeastern provinces were taken away by others. Amen, we can slightly reduce the expenditure of financial expenses in these places. Recently, the abolition of likin and the merger and abolition of collection agencies such as stamp licenses can also reduce a lot of financial expenses. However, the financial expenses in the new budget have increased by a huge amount of more than 6.92 million yuan, an increase of more than 400,000 yuan compared to the 6.5 million yuan in the previous year. No wonder Mr. Ma Yinchu, chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, wanted to complain at the meeting? However, Ma's struggle succumbed to the reason that the "Ministry of Finance must be difficult to comply with," and as a result, Ma's opinions were only used as a reference when preparing the next budget, and the original budget was passed as it was. Then, as citizens, we can only place our hopes on the future!</p>
<h3 id="e246">A Review of the Gold Standard Market <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— He Boxiong</p>
<p>(1) Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>The intensity of the fluctuations in the Shanghai gold standard market price in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934) was truly an unprecedented record. Looking at the overall gold price for the year, the highest price reached 1,087 yuan, and the lowest price was only 665.5 yuan, a difference of 420.5 yuan. The magnitude of the rise and fall is evident from this. The greatest driving force was in fact the threat of the United States' silver policy. The following is a record of the general situation of Shanghai's gold standard price fluctuations over the past year:</p>
<p>December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933): The Shanghai gold standard market situation. In the first ten days of the month, international news was extremely chaotic, causing the gold market to fluctuate from time to time; among them, the United States' gold purchasing policy and news of stabilizing exchange rates were the original driving force behind the gold market's waves. Entering the middle ten days of the month, the gold market suddenly experienced a surprising low point, falling through the major barriers of 680 to 700 yuan in one day. This was because news of the U.S. President's approval of the Silver Agreement and instructions to purchase silver at a price of 64.5 cents per short ounce were transmitted, causing the gold price to plummet.</p>
<p>January of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934): The gold market was extremely stable.</p>
<p>February: In the first ten days of the month, the gold price was also very mediocre. Entering the middle ten days of the month, the gold market was particularly depressed. This was partly because the end of the lunar year was approaching, and all parties were closing their accounts, and partly because of concerns about changing the new settlement price (see Section 3) and swap operations. (Note: Gold standard trading is divided into futures and spot transactions. The trading period includes swap and delivery periods. Swap is the period of hesitation given to traders each month in the middle of the month to buy or sell. The delivery period is the delivery period for gold standard transactions at the end of the month.) Entering the last ten days of the month, market sentiment was still uncertain, and transactions were still not active. Towards the end of the month, the gold price rose sharply due to the severe decline in the silver market.</p>
<p>March: From the perspective of the long-term trend for the entire month, there was a gradual advance. In the first ten days of the month, foreign news was divergent, and the market price was uncertain. The issue of raising the U.S. silver price and the talk of safe exchange rates were particularly sufficient to cause huge waves in the Shanghai gold standard market, and the gold market became increasingly strong. In addition, the rumors of international silver issues were sufficient to boost the prosperity of the gold market. By the end of the month, the gold market was almost entirely dominated by the U.S. silver issue due to complex international news, resulting in an increase of about 9.3 yuan compared to the end of the middle ten days of the month.</p>
<p>April: The gold standard market situation. From the beginning of the middle ten days to the last ten days of the month, news of a delay in the U.S. silver issue emerged, and the gold market showed its brilliance and rose rapidly. This was because the U.S. silver bill made no progress, and President Roosevelt expressed his rejection of silver legislation. News of the Japanese government's intention to purchase pure gold also arrived, and the gold price had an aura of invincibility. Looking at the overall gold price for the month, the highest gold price reached 1,027.7 yuan. Since the devaluation of the U.S. dollar and the change of settlement price, the Shanghai gold standard market has been extremely chaotic due to the complexity of international gold and silver economic issues.</p>
<p>May: The gold standard rose sharply last month, but it soared even higher this month, with the highest price being 1,087 yuan. In the last ten days of the month, news of the U.S. President's imposition of a 50% silver profit tax caused the gold market to retreat slightly, with the lowest price being 991.2 yuan. This month marked the discovery of new high and low records for the Shanghai gold price since the change in the settlement standard, with a difference of 79.1 yuan, which was also a new discovery for this year.</p>
<p>June: Market sentiment was extremely stable, and the rise and fall of the gold price was also extremely subtle. Towards the end of the month, the gold price began to fluctuate slightly due to the UK's refusal to pay overdue U.S. war debts and the complexity of the silver issue, but the trend was slightly weak.</p>
<p>July: Market sentiment was also extremely stable. Looking at the overall gold price for the month, the difference between the highest and lowest prices was only 22.9 yuan, making it the most stable month of the year.</p>
<p>August: In the first ten days of the month, the U.S. re-emphasized currency inflation, and the silver price rebounded, causing a sudden drop in the gold market. The UK and U.S. silver prices soared, and the U.S. government announced that it would nationalize silver and stop silver futures trading. As a result, the exchange market was unusually loose, and market sentiment was greatly disturbed, exacerbating the decline. It was rumored that the Chinese authorities would take measures to prevent foreign banks from shipping large amounts of silver for export, or impose a silver tax. Large dealers rushed to short sell, and the price suddenly soared to 65.5 yuan. It was later rumored that gold was flowing out of the United States and that exchange rates were trending lower, and the price returned to 60 yuan. Towards the end of the month, it was suddenly rumored that the United States was planning to inflate its currency again, and buyers were hesitant, causing the gold price to fall again. This shows the complexity of the gold price fluctuations this month.</p>
<p>September: The gold standard market situation. The complexity of domestic and international news caused extremely drastic changes. At the end of the first ten days of the month, the Ministry of Finance issued an order to ban gold standard and foreign exchange speculation (see Section 4 for details). At the end of the month, the rise in London gold prices was sufficient to affect the market price of the gold standard. In the first ten days of the month, the price rose first and then fell, without drastic changes. In the middle ten days of the month, the Ministry of Finance did not allow the gold standard to be settled based on foreign exchange, but changed to using the tariff gold converted from world gold bars as the gold standard settlement price, and the market situation was chaotic. In the last ten days of the month, the foreign silver market and the Shanghai foreign exchange market continued to grow, and international news was extremely complex, causing drastic changes in the market situation, and the decline became even more severe. The average price for the entire month was only 906 yuan, the lowest in nearly five or six months.</p>
<p>October: Domestic and international news was divergent, and the rise and fall of overseas silver prices were relatively large. In addition, after the Ministry of Finance implemented the additional silver export tax and balancing tax on the 15th, the gold standard market situation became extremely drastic. Although the UK and U.S. silver prices did not fall excessively, the Shanghai market was characterized by foreign merchants' operations, tight exchange rates, and panic among Chinese merchants. Although they rushed to close their positions, it was difficult to succeed. The gold price rose so sharply that the highest price reached 1,025 yuan.</p>
<p>November: After the gold price surge last month, the trend was relatively calm, but at the end of the middle ten days of the month and the beginning of the last ten days of the month, the difference between the high and low gold prices still varied by more than ten to twenty yuan per day. Initially, there was a large outflow of spot silver in Shanghai, leading to tight silver supply and higher interest rates on foreign exchange. Later, the Ministry of Finance ordered the customs to strictly suppress smuggling, and transportation to various ports in the country also required the approval of the authorities and the issuance of passports before shipment. There were also various rumors that were beneficial to the long side, so the gold price gradually advanced sharply, and reached as high as 1,022.5 yuan on the 24th. The following is a summary of the Shanghai gold market over the past year.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Financial Interest Rate Drop Gained Momentum Yesterday <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, which caused the financial situation to become even more sluggish. The interest rate market continued to decline without easing. The morning and afternoon markets fell by half a point, totaling six points. Compared to the previous day, it had dropped by more than six points. The bill transaction market was also weak. The morning market had over 1.4 million in account transfers and over 800,000 in new transactions. The afternoon market had over 400,000 in transactions. The Small General Association had over 200,000 in transactions. Foreign currency pawn transactions redeemed over 400,000 and newly made over 600,000. Money shops received over 48 million in foreign currency public bills and over 400,000 in remittances from various routes. As for the settlement side, it was suspended as usual due to the bank holiday. The other subsidiary currencies were also quiet due to the sluggish transactions on Sunday. Although Jiangnan small silver once fell below 1.5 yuan in the morning market, trading at 858 yuan, it rebounded by 2 yuan in the afternoon market, changing to 860 yuan, and ultimately rose slightly by 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver also fell below 1.2 yuan in the morning market, trading at 755 yuan, but it also rebounded by 1 yuan in the afternoon market, changing to 756 yuan, and ultimately fell only slightly by 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained at 306,000 wen, with no change from the previous day.

<p>Last week (January 14th to 19th), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market changed from hovering to weak, and then from weak to falling. The entire week was almost completely in a state of weakness. The fragility of sentiment and the weakness of market prices were due in part to the decline of various industries, and in part to the changes in the political situation. The supply and demand on the trading floor were also unfavorable to the long side due to the large short positions not being covered and the retail arbitrage transactions not being swapped. Moreover, with the imminent implementation of the transaction tax and the approaching Lunar New Year, customer groups were shrinking, transactions were not active, and market sentiment gradually declined. Therefore, although the foreign exchange rate was gradually reduced, and had dropped to the normal level of 1.3 points on Saturday, sentiment was not slightly excited. This was because the funds returned from the inland areas were not active, which was significantly different from previous years. The recent tense political situation made people even more afraid. There were not many days left in the year, and the delivery date was approaching. The future was not optimistic. Looking back at the past week, the market hovered and weakened on Monday and Tuesday, and transactions were very light. Although the foreign exchange rate was small, the money supply was still tight, and the transaction tax seemed inevitable. The floating longs were slowly released, and Numbers 47 and 48, etc. were sold off by a slightly smaller amount. On Wednesday, the hovering was the most severe, and the rise and fall was only about 0.1 point. On Thursday, there were more and more troublesome news from Chahar, and sellers from the north were pouring in, falling by 0.2 or 0.3 points. On Friday, the situation in Chahar had become a problem, and sellers were more active. Although the results were slightly less by 0.3 or 0.5 points, they rebounded, and the situation was still fluctuating. On Saturday, the political situation in Chahar was tense, rumors were rising, selling pressure was high, sentiment was fragile, and transactions were extremely active. The decline intensified, continuing for a small 0.3 or 0.5 points to 0.7 points. However, it was still higher than the previous low price by 1 yuan. As a result of the week's market price, it fell by several points to 1.23 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 68.8 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are shown in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from abroad. Foreign merchants were in great demand, and the prices of each month rose by three to four pounds. Then, Southern cotton farmers took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the bulls closed their positions, causing market prices to soften again. According to reports from retail trade, the cloth market traded well. At the close, the market was firm due to purchases from peers. The spot price rose by five pounds, and the futures price rose by two to six pounds. The British cotton market was weak, with the spot price falling by five points and the futures price falling by one or two points. The Indian cotton market opened weakly following the American cotton market, but then recovered due to speculative buying. The price of Apple Two fell by one rupee, Omra fell by half a rupee, and White Law Creek fell by one rupee and two and a half corners.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various sources were particularly scarce, with only 20 ships arriving (carrying nearly 4,000 dan). However, sales were also sluggish because the eve of the Lunar New Year was approaching. Because of the limited size of the street, and because customers only purchased 400 to 500 packages, the overall market situation did not improve despite the scarcity of goods. Thick and thin japonica rice both showed a downward trend, with prices continuing to fall by several points to nearly 10%. Du jian rice and Yin bian yuan rice, and other varieties, also fell by about 10%.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Wei Wenxiu Remarries Wang Kuixuan <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Helpless</p>
<p>Li Yuanhong's concubine, Wei Wenxiu, recently remarried Wang Kuixuan as his wife in Qingdao. Wei is 43 years old, while Wang is only in his thirties, which society finds laughable. In fact, in ordinary families, it is not strange for a concubine to remarry, let alone for a main wife to remarry, which is not uncommon at all. Wei Wenxiu, because she was Li Yuanhong's concubine, is now remarrying, and society finds it a topic of discussion, saying that Wei Wenxiu is ruining the reputation. And the people in Li's mansion must also consider it a great shame and humiliation, a matter that disgraces the family, which is not surprising.</p>
<p>In the history of the Republic of China, human beings are equal. Although Li Yuanhong was once the President, even if Mr. Li has not passed away now, the President is no different from ordinary people when he leaves office. Moreover, the current law does not allow concubines, so even if a concubine has unruly behavior, even if the original husband is still alive, there is no way to report it. Now that Mr. Li has passed away, Wei Wenxiu has no absolutely unbreakable relationship with Li's family. Therefore, Wei Wenxiu's remarriage to Wang Kuixuan is a very ordinary and extremely common thing.</p>
<p>As for the theory of Song Confucianism that "losing one's chastity is a major matter, starving to death is a minor matter," it is originally a moral issue, which cannot be judged by law, let alone interfered with by bystanders. "A concubine's heart is like ancient well water, and she vows not to cause waves." This kind of secluded, virtuous, and chaste virtue was rare to find in the ancients, and even less likely to be found in modern people. And what about asking a modern concubine for it? "When the sky is about to fall, dark clouds rise, and when a mother is about to remarry, she hardens her heart." Therefore, since Mr. Li has passed away, and his concubine wants to leave the hall and seek to go, she can only be allowed to seek to go, wanting to play a new tune on the lute. One can only let her play a new tune, it is only Wei's own personality issue, and it has absolutely nothing to do with Li's family style.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for women remarrying, there are only three points: (1) sexual impulse; (2) economic pressure; (3) being intolerable by the family. Wei Wenxiu has served Mr. Li for more than 20 years, so there is no need to worry about economic pressure. However, Wei is already 43 years old, and marrying a husband in his thirties, her sexual impulse may be unavoidable. Furthermore, judging from what she said in her letter, that she cannot be tolerated by her descendants, it can be generally seen that Wei is not tolerated by the family. In such a remarriage, both parties benefit. In Wei's case, why not do it? Even in Li's family, removing this thorn in their side, what is there to deeply blame?</p>
<p>Some people laugh and say that Wei is already 43 years old, while Wang is only in his thirties, which seems strange to sell a big man small. In fact, this is also not a strange thing. Looking at the women of today, their vanity is very developed. It is often the case that young girls marry old men in their fifties or sixties. Then, Wang Kuixuan's wife, Wei Wenxiu, is probably of the same mind as the women. If she is not tempted by money, then it is a "mystery of life." He must believe that Wei is the concubine of the President, and that marrying Wei is like clinging to the tail of a steed and advancing even more prominently. Or, he may think that the concubine of Mr. Li is, after all, different from an ordinary concubine, so regardless of her age, she has a value to marry.</p>
<p>Now, the marriage system is almost a formality, so divorce cases are increasing every day. And the identity of a concubine has not been confirmed by law, so why should we pay special attention to the remarriage of Li Yuanhong's concubine? This is truly what is meant by saying that even Confucius has a lewd heart. Therefore, I explain its meaning to tell those in the world who consider this matter to be an anomaly.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Winter Plum <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Little Oriole</p>
<p>The winter plum blossoms in the cold weather. It is because of the cold that its fragrance, excellence, and charming demeanor are particularly evident.</p>
<p>Its color is strangely endearing, with a pink outer layer revealing a red core. It does not require the support of branches and leaves, appearing tender like a young girl's cheek, radiating a smile. Within that smile, infinite charm teases people's hearts. Ah, this plump maiden!</p>
<p>Is it some kind of fascinating temptation? I couldn't resist buying a small pot and placing it on a corner of my desk. The stark, cold wind blows in from the window, so cold that it spreads throughout my body. After closing the window, where does this burst of fragrance come from? Looking back, the winter plum on my desk smiles again.</p>
<p>December is a sensitive month for me, a season of remembrance!</p>
<p>It was when the winter plum first bloomed that Wen left, wanting to fulfill her own imagination. She left so resolutely, as if she had complete confidence in her decision. Friends tried their best to persuade her, hoping she would deeply reconsider, but these efforts could not sway her even slightly. She had firmly believed that her ideal was correct, and only by following this path could she attain happiness.</p>
<p>A month, a year—time slipped away quietly, without a trace. In this ruthless passage of time, news of Wen disappeared. No, she was faintly forgotten among the people. Even if there were news, it would only be some lingering impressions in recollections.</p>
<p>In reality, after a woman gets married, all news about her ceases to attract attention. On one occasion, through indirect friends, I learned that Wen had given birth, and it was a boy. Logically, in an era when the patriarchal system had not yet been eliminated, this was a cause for celebration. However, conjecture cannot become fact, and sometimes it may even contradict the truth.</p>
<p>The weather is cold again, and the winter plum is exuding its pure, elegant fragrance. I don't know why, but every time I reach this time of year, I think of the winter plum and inevitably think of Wen's demeanor, which possessed the same hue as the winter plum. Therefore, I cannot help but buy one or two pots and place them on my desk. This seems to have become a habit, but a great miracle occurred. I never expected, no matter what, to see Wen in the winter plum flower market. Perhaps she didn't want to be discovered by me? She hurriedly prepared to leave, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Her face was thinner, and a few shallow wrinkles had appeared at the corners of her eyes. The color of the winter plum was gone. Where was the charm of her maiden years?</p>
<p>From our conversation, I learned that she had divorced, that her child had died, and that the reason for their divorce was based on "fading beauty." In the end, her eyes became a little red. Naturally, she was very sad and in pain.</p>
<p>I had no way to comfort her, and I didn't know why my feelings at that moment were so complicated. Returning home, I looked at the winter plum on my desk. Its scattered petals had fallen onto the book and into the pot. Its color was still vibrant, but its life was so short!</p>
<h3 id="e253">From Inland Invasion to the City <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<h3 id="e254">Thoughts Inspired by a Lunar Eclipse <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Bai</p>
<p>Reading alone under the lamp, the sound of gongs, drums, and firecrackers suddenly rang out. In this silent winter night, it sounded like a bombing attack during wartime. I couldn't help but throw my book down and jump up. But I immediately heard the cheers and curses of children. When the news of the lunar eclipse that I had read in the newspaper surfaced in my mind, I chuckled at my own panicked behavior.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I also participated in this unique ceremony of our ancient country. Half of it was due to poor education. The teacher in the private school told us that this was the wild moon eating the domestic moon, and we should beat gongs and drums to drive the wild moon away. But we questioned the teacher with "otherwise" and the like, and the teacher had no answer. In fact, the private school system only allowed the teacher to question the students, and the students had no room to speak. Are these many children not influenced by poor education? So I thought that our educational attitude was too lacking in seriousness. Ten years of study under the window were for going to court to become an official, and studying abroad was also for becoming an official. Striving to study while being obsessed with the dream of being an official has now led to not even having a place to eat. Thinking about it, even forcing a laugh is too much. This is a digression.</p>
<p>However, many highly educated Chinese people who clearly know that it is not the wild moon eating the domestic moon also sacrificed their sleeping time to participate in this grand event. What do you have to say about that?</p>
<p>A few years ago, rumors spread that the night would not get bright, and everyone hoarded grass and stored grain as if it were New Year's, and felt unusually panicked about this dark period, as if the world was going to turn into a terrible place. However, from the rumors to today, the sun rises in the east at the scheduled time every day, and these people who pursue light are instead indulging in darkness. In the world of neon lights, the moon already has no place. Even if the wild moon eats the domestic moon, what loss do they have?</p>
<p>From this I thought of a story: Someone stood by the roadside looking up at the sky. Someone else saw it and was curious, so they also stood and watched. Then someone C, someone D... When A became aware, he was already surrounded by a crowd. Someone asked A why, and A said: "The bird I raised escaped from its cage and landed on the eaves of the house across the street."</p>
<p>The Chinese people's "blindly following the crowd" and "busyness with nothing" are the most outstanding skills. The less it concerns themselves, the more willing they are to put in effort, otherwise they feel uneasy. However, when it comes to truly helping others, they stand by and watch. Being called a "strange nation" is not without reason.</p>
<p>If the lunar eclipse at night is the wild moon eating the domestic moon, will everyone beating gongs and drums be of any help to the moon itself? Knowing that the lunar eclipse is a natural phenomenon in the sky, but also blindly making a fuss, what is the reason for this?</p>
<h3 id="e255">Returning to Tangshan <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>As soon as it dawned, two buckets of porridge water with hardly any rice grains were placed in front of Chen Afa. They ate it hastily, and Chen Afa and dozens of young, strong, new, and old "fan ke" (overseas Chinese laborers) came from "Bo Li Lang" field. "Bo Li Lang" means police station, that is, ordinary people call the police station "Bo Li Lang". Several "Bo Li Lang" (Police) in yellow uniforms walked on the shining asphalt road like escorts of prisoners.</p>
<p>Although it was in the morning, the tropical sun was baking hotly on their heads and backs, making them feel a little uncomfortable. Sweat the size of soybeans oozed from their foreheads and flowed straight down their backs, soaking their white twill cloth coats. However, they could not get the freedom to rest, and had to follow several "Bo Li" aimlessly along this smooth, slender asphalt road.</p>
<p>"Where are we going after all?"</p>
<p>"Are we being sent to 'Bei Lan' to build the railway?" ("Bei Lan" is located in the Gulf of Siam, the first place that Chinese ships pass through when entering Siam.)</p>
<p>"Or are we being sent to Meng Lak to repair the Royal Park?"</p>
<p>Everyone's heart hid this question, and Chen Afa was no exception, feeling as anxious as an ant on a hot pot! However, no one wanted to open their mouths to say it, silently, limping, dragging their heavy, sluggish steps.</p>
<p>Behind them followed a group of idle wild children watching the excitement, and they were increasing, jumping, shouting, and laughing and screaming.</p>
<p>Passing through each street, the shop assistants on both sides of the shops stopped their work and ran to the front of the shops to watch the excitement, staring blankly with their heads raised like watching a god's procession in the countryside during the first month of the year, and slowly discussing together—</p>
<p>(The general people of Nanyang call the motherland "Tangshan".)</p>
<p>"Probably not, there hasn't been any case recently, has there?"</p>
<p>"Maybe these people can't pay the 'poll tax' this year?" It is said that those who can't pay the 'poll tax' this year will be sent back to 'Tangshan' without mercy once they are found out…"</p>
<p>These words sounded very disapproving to the old "fan ke" Chen Afa's ears at this time. He thought that he had spent more than twenty long years in Siam, and he was confident that he could abide by his duties in his daily work, and dare not act recklessly, but diligently be a docile person. Siam was simply his second hometown! Although business in Siam had not been good in the past few years, and he could not find work everywhere, causing a panic of unemployment, he could not pay the "poll tax" to the royal family on time every year. However, the royal family's magnanimity was great, as long as those who could not pay taxes did a week of voluntary work for the royal family, they could receive a "poll tax" receipt for nothing. Chen Afa had received his "poll tax" receipt in this way for the past two years. Therefore, Chen Afa absolutely dared not believe in his heart the saying "those who cannot pay the 'poll tax' will be sent back to 'Tangshan' without mercy once they are found out."</p>
<p>The road became flatter and wider, which made Chen Afa feel a little different from previous years. Although he was very sure that he would not be sent back to "Tangshan," he was still a little anxious in his heart!</p>
<p>…" Someone in their team sighed in a low voice.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Chen Afa raised his head. The towering Customs House, solemn and stately, was already lying across the front. In the Menam River, the huge "Xia Long Du" steamer, as large as a small mountain, which opened back to "Tangshan," the huge black smokestack, was quietly spitting out black gas in clusters. Under the violent oppression of several "Bo Li," they were driven onto the ship like pigs. Then, Chen Afa's dream was shattered. He looked at the tropical-flavored buildings on the shore, the green grass, and the happy and relaxed pedestrians. He couldn't help but think of his expectations when he left his hometown on a "red-headed sailboat" to Siam, and his wife and son in "Tangshan" still looking forward to him sending money to support them, and this time he was being forced to return to "Tangshan" in a state of destitution. His chest felt as painful as if a poisoned arrow had pierced it, and tears flowed torrentially from his eyes.</p>

<p>— Shi Weizhi</p>
<p>Reading advertisements is said to be more interesting than reading news sometimes. For example, in the classified advertisements in this city, you often have the opportunity to know the value of a dog and a person, and in other aspects, you can increase a lot of knowledge that you won't get from reading news! If there are any advertising wars, the situation will be even more lively and spectacular. Otherwise, as long as you are willing to be patient and flip through it, there is a lot of good material that can be selected into a collection of humorous articles.</p>
<p>Here's another example, for example, today's newspaper has an announcement about XX Elementary School changing bosses. The announcement is "declaring on behalf of" by a lawyer. This wonderful article from the village is buried...</p>
<p>"According to XXX Lai, XXX Elementary School Principal XXX has transferred the school to XX due to lack of time to manage it. All previous debts and entanglements of the school are the responsibility of Mr. X. In addition to drawing up a document, please publish it in the newspaper, etc. Declare on behalf of it as above, and all parents can go to XX Road to register for school affairs."</p>
<p>It's not easy to eat these days. What you hear and see is a sound of store closures and layoffs. Therefore, those who know a few words move their minds and gather a few like-minded comrades, rent a Shikumen (stone-framed gate) building, and open a Confucius-says shop (also known as Lane Elementary School) to make a living. Although this result may not lead to a life of abundance and honor for their ancestors, to put it nicely, "plain clothes are warm, and vegetable roots are fragrant" can be coped with.</p>
<p>As a result, a group of unemployed people feel that although there is no golden house here, it is still a place to eat. So you come, I come, and now it has become a situation where "there are schools in every lane, and no lane without a school" (lane means lane).</p>
<p>With more colleagues, naturally there will be some competition. The best way to compete is to win over celebrities to be school directors, and hang up the signs of first-class stars like theaters. In that case, why worry about not declaring "business is booming all over the world, and wealth is flourishing in all directions" and being full of customers?</p>
<p>Seeing that this strategy was very popular, they exhausted their efforts to save every penny to hang up the star signs. As a result, the stars still had to hang up the no-war signs and announce in the newspaper that they resigned from the school. (Not long ago...)</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Let's put that aside for now. If you have too many ideas, the paper tiger will be torn down, and some are because they don't have enough connections, so they can't find a star to hire from heaven and earth, so they have to sit on their cold benches in frustration.</p>
<p>Although many shops can form a market, we have an old saying that goes, "It's not a loss to run to three shops," and with more Confucius-says shops, customers will naturally have to choose those with "good quality and low price," so it is inevitable that several shops will have to post red paper signs to attract customers.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is useless to blame him with words such as insulting the purity and dignity of education. At the beginning of starting a business, who doesn't hope to achieve cheap and good quality? Who doesn't want to fulfill some of the obligations that citizens should fulfill? Besides making a living for themselves.</p>
<p>In desperation, they naturally have to "let others laugh and scold, I will do it myself." To talk about propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, to talk about reputation and morality, you must first have enough to eat.</p>
<p>If some people still think that this kind of "commercialization of education" is still a bit "that," then let's just forget about this kind of high-sounding words. You see, the so-called prestigious universities and colleges are not bragging about the school's facilities to "attract customers."</p>
<p>It should be known that the so-called "lane elementary school" of Confucius-says shops is just a clever way for unemployed intellectuals who have no choice.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Spring Night Song"</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum flowers bloom all over, whiter than cotton. The affairs of spring are coming to an end, and the song of farewell is passed on. The fallen flowers are still not swept away by the servants. It is the sound of despair. Poets and lyricists are not interested. The old oriole cries, but no one sees it. Fortunately, the spring is still there before the dawn bell. First, tell the banquet of parting before seeing off the spring light. Jade is on the curtain. The spring bamboo shoots are open, and the color and taste are fresh. Singing and clapper boards play on the table. Writing poems is divided into rhymes and quick questions. Suddenly, the east wind comes and bids me farewell. The south wind is gentle and continuous. There is another Du Mu who is sad about spring. He quickly whips the skinny West Lake in Yangzhou. There is also the poetic meaning of Lu You that spring returns. A boat of smoke and waves is exhausted. There is also the brocade screen person who sees the spring light as cheap. The sound of the oriole is round and slippery. Sad for the fallen flowers. Send off the flower fairy. The night wind is too crazy. I knew that the spring color was already gone and there was nowhere to appreciate it. Regret planting azaleas in youth. I knew that spring would return and still I would labor to send it. Jin Ling should have protected Chang Juan earlier. Now, the deep love of fragrant grass is sad and thin. Bury the smoke of the Green Jade South City in the east wind. Leave a section of Wushan cloud. The sound of spring will still be waited for next year. Wait until next year when spring comes early. When the apricot blossoms are red again (not in vain) Du Fu met Li Guinian back then.</p>

<h3 id="e261">"Young and Inexperienced, Good Fortune Turns into Bad Luck" Conchitsa Montenegro's Regret <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Mei</p>
<p>Luck is not necessarily a good thing; it depends on how you use it. If you use it well, you can become famous overnight. However, if you don't use it well, you can miss opportunities and regret it. For example, Conchitsa Montenegro's experience can serve as a lesson for other lucky people. She has now realized her past mistakes and is trying to remedy them, but it is already a great effort. However, her ability to realize this early is still a sign of intelligence.</p>
<p>After her repentance, she said, "My good fortune is my bad fortune. I should be punished by Hollywood!" Why did she say such a thing? Let's talk a little about her past.</p>
<p>In short, she became famous too early and too quickly. Her luck was too good. She was young and inexperienced and didn't know how to use it, so she gained and lost her good fortune. Now that she is twenty-one years old, her mind has matured with her body, and she realizes her past mistakes and wants to regroup and start over. She has some talent, a talent for singing and dancing, so she can still stand her ground in Hollywood and climb back up step by step. She is currently playing a very important role at Fox. However, she might have already become a big star if she hadn't been so confused before.</p>
<p>Conchitsa Montenegro was a singing and dancing star brought to the United States from Paris by MGM three years ago. At that time, she had indeed reached the status of a star, and her future seemed very secure. However, that future did not materialize as expected. Step by step, her work gradually decreased, and her contracts were canceled and not renewed. Recently, in addition to performing dance skills everywhere, she has only filmed a few short films in foreign languages.</p>
<p>Conchitsa is a spoiled child with a temper, a young lady's temper, and cannot tolerate any grievance. She was born in San Sebastian, a famous summer resort in Spain. Her father was a high-ranking military officer, and her family was very wealthy. She has an older sister, and they both studied at a convent from a young age. Once, the convent held a charity singing and dancing performance for the poor children of the area, and that was the turning point in Conchitsa's life. Conchitsa and her sister danced. After they finished dancing, the teachers, students, and family members praised them, making little Conchitsa so happy that she became arrogant.</p>
<p>She told her mother that she wanted to go to Paris to specialize in dancing. Of course, her parents never refused this little girl's wishes, so they sent her to a very famous singing and dancing school in Paris. Conchitsa was a child with innate talent and extremely beautiful posture. So, at the age of thirteen or fourteen, she had already gained a good reputation in Paris. Later, she continued to perform on stage in major cities such as Berlin, London, and Madrid, further captivating audiences. By the age of fifteen, she was famous throughout Europe and welcomed everywhere. At this time, an MGM investigator signed a contract with her, inviting her to the United States to make movies. So she and her sister went to Hollywood together.</p>
<p>MGM had great expectations. Conchitsa also had great expectations. When she arrived in Hollywood, she rented a luxurious mansion in the most expensive area, bought a large car, and hired a chauffeur in uniform, making a great splash and becoming very popular for a while. But Conchitsa now says with regret, "I didn't have any mental preparation when I received so much glory at that time. Because of my arrogance and rudeness, I inevitably had conflicts with others and ran into obstacles everywhere. Sometimes the company asked me to change my hairstyle, and I felt that it was an insult. Sometimes I wanted to perform in a certain way, and the director asked me to perform in another way, and I felt like I had become someone's slave. I refused to listen to advice. Because I had only heard praise and compliments before, I had never been criticized by others. So every time I encountered obstacles, I argued and threw tantrums. Sometimes I even cried because I couldn't do what I wanted freely.</p>
<p>As a result, the MGM authorities became tired of it, the contract was canceled, and her status suddenly declined. She soon realized that if she wanted to gain a foothold in Hollywood, she had to change her temper, be harmonious, and cooperate with others. She was determined to exist in Hollywood. Although her sister had already returned to Spain, she couldn't bear to give up the taste of the glory she had once enjoyed. Her realization was: "Becoming famous too early and too quickly is a bad thing. Anyone who becomes famous too early and too quickly should swallow their pride first, otherwise, they will run into big trouble!"</p>

<p>Li Que Dielikes saw a calf injured among a herd of stampeding cattle. He rescued it and bandaged its wound. In the evening, after filming the movie, he took the calf home, slept with it in the same bed, and slept for one night.</p>
<p>Frank Lee Trinkin always carries a tube of anti-virus ointment in his pocket. Before and after kissing, he uses it on his lips, no matter who the female star is.</p>
<p>Director Alvin Cowper now lives in the house that the mysterious girl Greta Garbo used to live in. But recently, he raised the fence by two feet. He said Garbo was not mysterious enough.</p>
<p>Director E.H. Griffith has been using a corn cob pipe for twenty years. But when the British novelist Hugh Walpole arrived in Hollywood, he used sixty-five pipes in rotation every day. It took four days to complete one cycle.</p>
<p>That is a true and reliable fact. The famous Hollywood dance director, Leroy Prinz, does not dance a single step himself.</p>
<p>Musician Vincent Roberts has a very rich collection of star signatures. Recently, someone was willing to pay 100,000 gold yuan for it, but he refused to part with it.</p>
<p>Charlie de Waal said that his entry into the film industry should be attributed to a poker game. He was originally a newspaper reporter, but he was fired by his employer because of a poker game.</p>

<p>Douglas Fairbanks, who has been absent for a long time and is now divorced from Mary Pickford, his martial arts romantic style has always been loved by fans at sea. Mr. Fairbanks, in order to be careful in his later years, is unwilling to repeat his past success. Therefore, his works are impossible to see. Fortunately, the British London Film Company repeatedly persuaded him, and Mr. Fairbanks agreed to star in "The Private Life of Don Juan." Currently, the film has arrived in China and is being inspected in Nanjing. It will be released after "Lake Country Carnival." Don Juan, the great lover of the nineteenth century, his secret history and romantic traces, performed by Mr. Fairbanks on the screen, should be immortal.</p>
<p>Laurel and Hardy's slapstick feature films are indeed very precious. Since they became famous, there have only been two feature films. The ones that have been publicly screened in this city are "Sons of the Desert" and "Twice Two." But now the third work "Babes in Toyland" will be performed at the end of the year. Then, in the sound of firecrackers, the audience should prepare to laugh heartily.</p>
<p>Slapstick superstar Eddie Cantor only has one work a year. This year's work is "Kid Millions," which is produced by American Goldwyn and presented by United Artists. It will also be publicly screened at the Grand Shanghai Theater on New Year's Day. During the New Year, it is essential to receive this timely masterpiece.</p>
<p>"The Private Life of Don Juan" A performance of the Spanish great lover Don Juan (Fairbanks) seeking love - will be released soon at the Nanjing Grand Theater</p>

<p>Since the Nanjing Central Film Studio began to recruit male and female actors, the registration has been very enthusiastic. It is understood that the studio is a state-run film production studio, and its management methods and film production plans will follow the methods of state-run film production agencies in the Soviet Union and Italy. Actors, if selected, have a very promising future. Therefore, young male and female students who are fascinated by movies are flocking to register. However, many people are not clear about the registration procedures, often making futile trips. According to investigations, applicants must have a front and side half-length photo, and a full-body photo, a total of three photos, and must measure their height and weight before filling out the registration form. The registration location is at No. 27 Tong'an Lane, Shilu, Sanma Road, International News Photography Agency.</p>

<p>The Suzhou Film Studio is a small company that started with a few thousand dollars. Its debut work "Children's Light" has been completely filmed.

<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Mary has decided to marry Dylan. They have chosen another good day. Everything is being arranged as before. Life is like a dream. Tomorrow, Mary will be Mrs. Dylan Duda again. But now she feels a little sorry for Geoffrey. She watched Geoffrey sitting across from her in her study. She said softly, "Are you angry with me? Is it because I'm going to marry Dylan that you want to go to Yemen?" Geoffrey lowered his head! Looking at his cigarette, he said, "I really don't have any reason to stay here anymore, so I'm going back to Spain, but I sincerely want you to be happy together." Mary said, "But, Geoffrey, is it... that day when you and Paula came to find us, was I deliberately too stupid..." Geoffrey said angrily, "You're not stupid, I'm too stupid. I'm suffering the consequences of my own actions, what else can I say?" Mary said, "What does that mean?" Geoffrey hesitated for a moment, then said, "For twenty years, you have been in love with Dylan, and I have been in love with you. I won't compete with others, I'm quietly waiting for you to leave him automatically, and then I'll tell you..." As he said, he raised his head and looked at Mary's face, but Mary's eyes were already filled with tears. She choked and said, "Oh, Geoffrey, you have to believe me. I didn't know anything." Geoffrey said, "Of course, you wouldn't know. But now, I can only wish you a happy future." Mary said, "Then you can rest assured. I will definitely be happy when I marry Dylan. He is a careful and considerate person. He even remembered to send a lot of popcorn when I was onstage that day."</p>
<p>At this time. Herbert walked in and said, "Geoffrey, it's time. The ship is about to leave." Geoffrey stood up. Mary also stood up and kissed him briefly. Geoffrey walked out without looking back. Herbert deliberately walked behind, and after Geoffrey walked out, he said to Mary, "This is what you should know, the popcorn was sent by Geoffrey, not by Dylan." As he spoke, he also left.</p>
<p>They all left. Mary stood alone in the middle of the room, her hands clenched into fists. Popcorn, it turned out to be sent by him. Geoffrey, that thoughtful, serious Geoffrey. She remembered the things from her childhood, Geoffrey treated her so considerately and tenderly, she felt a pang of sadness. She only knew then that the person she loved was Geoffrey, only Geoffrey. So she ran into the garden, found Dylan, and asked him breathlessly, "What would you do if I, like you, left someone in the chapel?" Dylan initially didn't know she was serious, he laughed and said, "Who gave you the idea to ask me this kind of question? Eleanor?" But Mary said, "Dylan... I'm talking to you seriously!" Dylan said, "I'm also talking seriously. Let's do it the same way tomorrow. I'll go to the chapel early in the morning. You come late at night. When almost everyone..." Mary shouted, "This is not the time to joke. I'm just asking you, what would you do?" Dylan saw that the situation was not right. This was asking him to think. How should he answer? He couldn't answer for a moment, and only said, "How do I tell my friends?" Mary heard this and couldn't help but shout, "What?" She burst into tears and laughter at the same time. Dylan couldn't help it and shouted loudly, "Mary, what's wrong with you? You're humiliating me! You can't treat me like that! I can't take it!" Mary cried and said, "Oh, you know you can't take it! You quickly think of a way to take it! Go chop down the forest... I got infinite benefits. You can learn to swim and ride a horse. Otherwise, cry until you fall asleep. You think about it yourself! I'm not doing it!"</p>
<p>She covered her mouth and ran wildly outward. Dylan chased and shouted behind her, but she didn't hear him. She ran straight to the pier and found Geoffrey. Geoffrey asked her with a straight face and without a smile, "What are you doing here?" Mary said, "Nothing... but I heard that Spain is the most beautiful in the spring." Geoffrey said, "That's right." Mary turned around, grabbed Geoffrey's sleeve, and asked him with a look of sincerity and fear, "Will they let a fool like me land?" How Geoffrey answered her, you guess for yourself! (The End)</p>

<p>In 1920, a well was opened in the Taizhou Guild Hall on Xinjiao Road, Xujiawan, Shanghai. By 1926, the well suddenly dried up and was filled in. Recently, flames suddenly erupted from the water pipe at the wellhead, reaching as high as a person. The flames burned continuously. The guild hall then built a short brick wall next to it and set up utensils on top to boil water and cook food. According to experts, this is because there is a large amount of extremely flammable garbage buried in the ground, which has produced a kind of marsh gas containing methane over time.</p>
