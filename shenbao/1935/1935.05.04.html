<h3>絲綢業衰頽中之一點希望</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>絲綢銷路。自海外市塲被奪。僅恃用戶交易。聊以搘持。然年來絲綢銷路。雖價格日港。仍不如前因是經營綢業者。不論其爲織造爲經售。均在在有虧蝕之虞。聞本年以來。市面更劣。推其原因。乃由售價無論其如何低賤。營業總難望起色。蓋以一般經濟窘迫日漸深刻。貨物縱美。售價縱廉。無如無力購買。廉亦無益。此物價低落緣於需要减縮者也。夫爲需要减縮而價廉。與夫生產過剩而價廉。其情形逈乎不同。因此綢業之不易起色。絲市之難得振興。恐非短時問事旣非短時間事。然則將任其衰頹而不加挽救乎。是亦不然。蓋中國今日經濟困難之最大癥結。患在不生產不生產。斯無來源無來源。則去路易絕。絲綢究不失爲一種生產事業。豈可以絲價賤而不育蠶。綢價賤而不製絲。果其如此。旣無生產之術。市面豈有好轉之望。故今日之問題。乃在今年之收繭。作何方針。收繭後之繅絲作何辦法。其在農家方面。不應以繭價廉。而不復育蠶。蓋繭價雖廉。畢竟還有收益。終勝於不生產也。其在繭商。往時收繭。不無壓抑蠶戶。冀獲非常之利。或則優劣不分。致隳改良繭質之心。或則同業競爭。抬價收買。而種他日失敗之因。凡此均非正則。繭質之退化。過去繭業之失敗。繭商自身。亦應負相當責任。製絲業更應從其刷新技術。改進生產設備入手。其事固難。但不如此。不能角逐於海外市塲。復興更難。而待價以估。不問局勢。專顧自利之積習。亦有革洗之必要。綢業方面。年來翻陳出新。爭奇鬥妍。固足以動人目而杜外貨之侵入。然正惟如此。在百業蕭條。經濟緊縮之秋。時時翻新銷路不足以應之。存貨易於擱積。周轉遂失其敏活。虧蝕卽隨之而來。故綢業中似應自謀統制。對於生產然。銷貨亦然。誠能一致尚質不尚文。輕盈奇巧之外貨。又相約不爲承銷。實不失爲自救以救絲繭業之一道。蓋今日欲謀减少入超之數字。除於積極方面促進輸出外。要在自產者求自用。不待外求。如是外貨自無由輸入。是故。一面維護絲綢業。同時絲綢業奮發自强。檢點已往過失。從各方面圖改進力求適合國人之需要。斯乃自產自用最良之一法也。</p>

<h3>英下院辯論外交政策　麥唐納發表宣言　力主與德合作維持歐洲和平　中歐羅馬會議英國不欲參加</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院辦論外交政策、外交席興旁聽席均爲人滿、首相麥唐納發表宣言、力主與德合作、以維持和平、並限制軍備、尤以天空者爲最、外相西門亦作同樣之籲請、並勸德國表示其準備參加和平工作、不僅出之以言、且將見諸於行、商相任錫曼宣布一九三四年有英國所造飛機引擎九十六具、運往德國、其言亦惹人注意、反對黨工黨領袖藍斯堡對於首相之宣言、曾表示極端之失望、此爲今日辯論之大概情形、首相麥唐納曰、英國之外交政策、合防務與集體安全兼國際軍備與和平協約而成、其目的非在軍事聯盟、而在可能的最廣大之合作、目前注意與英國間之良好諒解、吾人寶之爲</p>
<p>和平保障　且歡迎其他各國加入此種自由的結仆、其前途含有緩和之機會、而亦含有可覺得的危險、余之言此、乃出於甚大之信念、並因深知其癥結、英國恒留心輔助來自談判的協約之機會、而不擾及歐洲或世界之和平、首相於是乃追述二月三日以來之時事、而言及是日所發表之英法共同宣言、謂所計畫的談判、其目的之一、爲與德國並其他各國締結自由談判的軍備公約、以代凡爾賽和約之軍事條欵、此舉若早成功、則目前歐洲之危險將消滅過半、倫敦宣言曾明白表示英法方將脫離凡爾賽之範圍、而根據安全之</p>

<h3>蘇州女子陳鳳齡　訴朱端甫遺棄</h3>
<p>請給生活費二萬元　並追償私蓄一千元</p>
<p>住居愛文義路平和里八號門牌之蘇州女子陳鳳齡、現年廿七歲、近延張奕鋆等律師具狀、向第一特院民庭控訴住居武定路九十四號門牌之朱端甫（卽朱純秋）惡意遺棄、請求給付贍養費二萬元、幷返還私蓄一千元等情一案、昨晨十時、由駱崇泰推事蒞民七庭傳訊、原·被·兩造、均未到案、各延律師代表到案、卽據原告代理張律師起稱、查原告陳鳳齡、現年二十七歲、於十七歲時、與被告朱端甫</p>
<p>相識同居</p>
<p>被告當時諉稱中餒猶虛、尚未授室、故對內對外、咸以夫婦相稱、迨至同居以後、始發覺被告早已娶妻、祗因木已成舟、只可屈居妾媵、十載以還、感情尚稱融洽、不料去年七月間、被告又結識一舞女、因此態度突變、初則以經營股票爲由、向原告騙去私蓄洋一千元、繼則愛情破裂、實行遺棄不顧、查原告與被告雖無夫妻之份、但已定</p>
<p>妾媵之名</p>
<p>十載於茲、今春見原告年長色衰、無端遺棄、不獨情所難恕、亦爲法所不容、且原告體弱多病、別無生產能力、日後生活、勢將陷於絕境、故不得已惟有請求鈞院准予判令被告一次給付原告贍養費洋二萬元、因被告秉承視遺財產、在叉袋角一帶、擁有地產頗多、當原被告同居時代、被告除按月給付原告</p>

<p>羅蘭書庽</p>
<p>其時因被告年齡尚輕、不免走馬章台、遂於斯際與原告相識、被時原告有一陳姓恩客、頗有藏嬌之意、結果未成事實、原告因生意淸淡、邀被告帮忙、乃和酒報效、所費不貲、至民十七正月間、雙方情愛熱烈、原告卽停止應徵、偕其假母賃屋而居、被告卽時往過從、酌給生活費百元、或數十元、或百數十元不等、視經濟能力而定、並無月給二百元之事、至去年因市面不景氣、被告當然</p>
<p>亦受影響</p>
<p>經濟拮据、故着原告遷至家中居住、幷因原告另有嗜好、屢加勸戒、原告非但不允、且有不堪入耳之語言、遂致愛情破裂、被告亦絕跡不去、查此種祗係友誼關係、旣無名義、當無撫養義務、故卽一元亦不能負擔、至私蓄一千元之部份、應請着令提出證據云云、駱推事以案情明瞭、由兩造律師辯論終結、諭定期本月八號上午九時宣判、</p>

<p>據中央統計報告、全國人口有百分之八十是不識字的文盲、而不識字者、尤以勞動界佔最多數、我們舉最近調查、江灣不識字者的統計來說、江灣人口共有一萬三千七百六十四人、不識字的有一萬一千六百五十七人、識字的只有二千一百零七人、這是一個可靠的數目、在這不識字的數日裏、我們農工的知識水準、是個什麽樣子、中國民衆敎育稱度是如何的低落、處今日國際形勢日益嚴重、國家地位、日益低落、以不識字的無知識的民衆、不瞭解世界大勢與民族國家之危機、無民族國家的遠大觀念、這樣又從那裏去談救國呢、如果不從知識上敎育上着手改造、那末又會是流入言而不行、專喊口號、只能跟着人家喊口號了、所以本市市政府、市黨部·及各界領袖有見及此、因發起識字運動、第一步計劃、先從識字做起、掃除文盲、尤其是對於佔有本市人口最多數不識字最多數的工友們要使他識字、梁任公說、「敎育是什麽敎育、是教人學做人敎人、做現代的人、」這話就是說、每一個人要做現代的人、原始時代、社會文化沒有建設起來、一切都是野蠻不合理、那時候、不受敎育、不讀書、不識字、是沒有什麼大關係的、可是現在已不是那種時代了、現在是智慧的世界、愚笨的、沒知識的就會受淘汰、就不能生存、杜威氏會有一句話說、「敎育爲生活所必需、沒有敎育、人類的生活就要停止、」這就是說不受敎育的人、不但自已不能生活、全社會也都要受其影響損害、所以識字、續書、受敎育、實在是重要極了、尤其在今日之中國、救國救民族、不容稍緩的當兒、我們還是不識字的、無知識的行嗎、論語上說「工欲善其事、必先利其器、」我俄如果要復興民族、振興國家、我們就得先識字、識字然後有智識、有智識然後有思想、然後有復興民族的决心、那末我們一定可以使民族國家復興强盛了、今日是上海市識字述動週開始的第一天、兄弟敬貢獻三點意見給全市工友、全國工友、第一點、勞工識字、勞工在社會地位之重要、與國家關係的密切、兄弟已經說過、那末勞工識字、當然是目前最重要的一件事業、所以希望勞動界人士及各界人士對勞工的重要、應加以認同時對勞工識字加以扶助、就是我們全上海友、全國工友也都要認淸識字的好處、我們要　良待遇、要改良生活、要使工人的地位提高、　使民族復興要使國家强盛、就非努力於識字　可、第二點、勞動服役、中國工人知識水準低　這個程度、都是一個字也不認識、一旦要達到部識字目的、要用什麼方法呢、這個就得遵照蔣　　委員長的勞動服役的方法和精神了、在教人識字的人當然要辛辛苦苦的、「敎人不厭一、在受識字敎育的人、更應當用心用意的爲學不倦一、有很多的年輕人、說我們一天到晚作工，沒有　息、那裏還有時候讀書呢、那些年紀老的人也　我年紀大了、還要讀什麼書、表面看去似乎也有理由、實際上這都是怠惰偷安的心理、我們知道世界是進化的、一時代一時代不同、我們即使不能跑在時代前面、最低限度也應跟着時代跑、現在這時代是一個非常的奮鬥時代、不努力就要受淘汰、不努力就不能生存、我們多費一點點時光、來識字來讀書、這不但與個人有極大便利、在國家社會兩方面、都有好處、所以勞動服役的精神、實在是推動社會進化的大力量、第三點勞資合作、中國現在是愚笨·窮困·落伍的國家、要進步、先得解决窮困、欲解决窮困、也得解决愚笨、在民國十六年工人運動蓬勃的黃金時代、是向資本家進攻、喊打倒資本家的時候、但是現在中國有沒有資本家呢、根本就够不上資本家的名位了、中國的過去的許多小資本家、現在已全被帝國主義的舶來資本家壓倒了、中國幾無資本家、打倒資本家、自然談不到、而爲着增加生產復興民族起見、積極的、我們要實行勞資合作、在現在這個局面下、假如勞資不合作、那末雙方都會要遭受帝國主義的高壓而同歸於盡、我們對中國要整個解决、對內關於生產方面、就應該勞資協調、發展民族資本、對外就以民族資本抵抗帝國主義資本、全上海工友、我們要解放東縛、我們要創造環境、我們要跑出黑暗地獄、我們非靠自己力量不可、假如大家能够一致的向前跑去、我想中國一定有辦法、今天是五一國際勞動節、又是上海市識字運動宣傳週開始的一天、所以我把過去的工運過程說一說、同時談到識字的重要、再談到今日勞工應有之努力希望大家都能發奮圖强、使百分之八十的文盲、全都能識字有想、有奮鬥能力、有犧牲精神、那末才能救自己、才能救社會、救國家、救民族、</p>

<p>親愛的同胞們：</p>
<p>你們大概都知道不識字的痛苦吧，一個不識字的人，他不會記賬，不會寫信，不會看報，不識牆上的招貼，不懂官廳的佈告，不明世界的大勢，有時簡直是有眼等於無眼，變成一個「亮眼瞎子」，他的苦楚，真是一言難盡。</p>
<p>在我們中國，這種不識字的人，一百人之中大約有八十人，上海也有幾十萬人。我們要解除人民的通苦，復興我們的民族，我們首先便要使這許多不識字的人大家都識字。為此，我們從今年七月一日起，即將開始大規模的識字教育運動，預定在道一年之內，使上海幾十萬不識字的男女老少，都有識字的機會，並且附帶的給他們一點常識，指導和公民訓練，使他們都成為健全的國民。</p>
<p>我們所用的方法：第一是劃分上海為二十二區，每區設立六十個識字班，全市共設一千三百二十個識字班，強迫不識字的人每天去讀一小時的書，不獨不收學費，而且奉送書籍，讀上兩個月就可畢業：第二，對終一部份實在不能天天到學校去讀書的人，我們就派先生到他們家裏去個別指導，兩個月之後，如經我們考試及格，我們也可給他們畢業證書，到了那個時候，他們賬也會記了，信也會寫了，淺近的報也會看了，不獨他們自己方便，就是我們全上海人也都覺得很有面子。假使有人不知自愛，不願識字，那我們一定要給他們相當的懲戒。</p>
<p>但是在沒有調查之前，我們這種辦法是無從着手的：因為我們現在還不知道何人不識字，不識字的人究竟有多少，何人可在早晨上學，何人可在晚間上學，何人實在不能上學，我們如何便可辦率校？派先生？所以江灣實騐區已從四月十日起，南市實騐區已從五月一日起，其他二十區將從五月十日起，分派大批調查員，携帶證明文件，實地調查不識字民眾，並且附帶勸導他們去上學。</p>
<p>如上所述，這個識字教育運動，顯然是一件很繁重很艱難的工作，我們人手不多，能力有限，不能不望社會各界多多贊助。中國幸甚！</p>
<h3>識字教育總動員</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>中華民國的國民，我們的同胞，有百分之七十以上是目不識「丁」的文盲，換句話說，有三萬萬以上的國民是不識字：上海市的市民，就算較內地開通，恐怕老少文盲，連租界在內，總數也要到一百五十萬人左右，現代文明各國，識字的國民至少佔國民總數百分之七十以上，多的竟能達到百分之九十以上，我國相形見絀，無怪國勢衰頹一至於此！現在「民族復興」的口號，充溢全國，但如果不從普及教育！——識字是普及教育的初步——着手，一切等於空談，所以中央規定七項運動，識字運動翹然居首。</p>
<p>普及識字教育的重要，可無庸再費筆墨。目前上海市識字教育的工作既經開始，所敢以十二萬分的誠意希冀終吾上海市民者，只有「識字教育總動員」七個字。所謂「運動員」者，上至總司令，各路司令，各軍師旅團營長，下至連排長以及弟兄們，都上前綫去，準備作殊死戰；後方的人民，工作的工作，輸將的輸將，救護的救護，也各盡其所能，為戰爭作後盾，然後「總動員」才名副其實。我們從事識字教育的工作，也必須聯合政府與人民的全力，與「文盲充塞」的現象作殊死戰，與「愚昧無知」的病根作殊死戰，抱定决心，百折不回，方有成功的希望。</p>
<p>因此，識字教育宣傳期間的工作，　等於美國十七八年前參加歐洲大戰時期的宣傳工作，也要等於日本三十年前對俄作戰時期的宣傳工作，更要等於現在世界各國訓練人民防空自衛—…等等的宣傳工作。我們必須以全市教育界為主力軍，以全市工商各界為共同作戰的聯合軍，以全市的黨員和公務人員為策動的幹部，動員一切已受教育力能教人識字的市民，在識字教育委員會命令之下，依據所頒布的一切規章，為一字教育而服務。假定市政府所辦的識字學校，為正面的軍隊，則市民個人或團體所辦的識字學校無異為左翼右翼的軍隊，而其他一切服務團，互助團，工學團，文化細胞，小先生等等又無異為千變萬化出奇制勝的別動隊。凡我們已受教育的人，不問程度的高下，學問的深淺，都應明明白白的認識，如果市內在一二年以後尚有不識字的民眾，就是我們的恥辱，就是我們的失敗；同時應該切切實實的工作，紮硬寨，打死仗，必期達到掃蕩市內一切文盲的目的而後已。假使力能教人識字的市民，不分黨部，政府，學界，工界，商界，自由職業者，乃至游藝人員，鄉村學究，確能全體總動員，向「文盲充塞」「愚昧無知」的現象作總攻擊，我以為全市一萬五十萬人左右的文盲，不離在最短期間一變無為識字的市民。希望有知識的市民，能教人的市民，大家加入「識字教育一的軍隊，動員到前綫去！</p>
<h3>掃除文盲</h3>
<p>— 吳開先</p>
<p>掃除文盲，是現代每一個國家建國的先决條件。若聯蘇，若土耳其，在革命以前，他們國民識字的比率，國民的文化水準一樣的很底：革命以後，他們政府和民眾，便用全力來掃除文盲。現在的蘇聯和土耳其，不但在政治，經濟等各方面，已經面目一新；而一般國民文化水準的提高，更使革命以前望塵莫及了。</p>
<p>一國國民文化水準的提高，固然不能說百分之百的建築在人民識字程度上面；但可以說百分之九十是跟着識字程度的提高而提高的。文字原是文化寶庫的一個總鑰匙：掃除文盲，使全屬國民都能認識並應用基本文字，文化的傳播自然便易，國民的一般文化水準，自然跟着提高了。</p>
<p>中國不識字的人，本無正確的統計，依一般人的佔計，大約在百分之八十以上，這百分之八十以上的人，非但不能够寫信，記帳，看報，看招貼，看布告，而且更因之而缺乏一般關於自然，社會，國家，民族的必要常識。國民文化水準的低落，在現代一般文明國家中，簡直找不出第二個來。這實在是第一等的「國恥」。大家想想，這樣一個國家，真是「不够資格」，怎麽能適存於現在的世界呢？所以我們要復興民族，要建設國家，要創造交化，第一步便非厲行識字教育掃除文盲不可。</p>
<p>上海，是中國第一個大都市，亦即是國際六大都市之一，一般市民的文化水準，自較各地為高；然據調查統計，光是市區，除失學兒童外，不識字的市民，還是有五六十萬。現在實施識字教育我們必須依照預定計劃，儘一年之內，使這五六十萬文盲，一律變為能認識應用基本文字之公民：使全國各地開風興起，掃除文盲，提高文化水準，洗滌這希有的「國恥」。這樣，我們才談得到復興民族，建設國家，創造文化！也只有這樣，我們才可以適存於　在的世界！</p>
<h3>識字教育的目的在那裏</h3>
<p>— 吳醒亞</p>
<p>上海市識字教育委員會，這一次定下了很細密的方法，出以最大的决心，來推行識字教育，希望在一年之中，掃除上海市區以內的文盲。</p>
<p>上海市的文盲掃除了以後，所謂睜着眼睛的瞎子是重睹光明了，這就算識字教育的目的已經達到了嗎？不，絕不。如果不識字的人都能識字，能記零用賬，能寫自己的姓名，能讀報上的廣告，能了解官署的布告，就算是識字教育的目的巳經達到，這不僅藐視識字教育運動的偉大。而且褻凟識字教育運動的尊嚴。</p>
<p>原來識字教育絕不是單單教人識字，在識字以外，還有常識指導及公民訓練兩種更加重大的工作。所以。常識指導及公民訓練才是識字教育的目的：認識文字不過是達到這個目的的方法。</p>
<p>當然，不先識字，常識指導及公民訓練的兩件工作也無從實行：所以，識字教育運動的順序，是文字教育在先，常識指導及公民訓練在後，但是，這個先後之分，絕不是輕重之分；我以為常識指導及公民訓練所需要的力量和時間，比較文字教育所需要的，應當更加偉大和更加長久，方才能够完成識字教育運動的使命。</p>
<p>至於常識如何指導，公民如何訓練，茲事體大思精，識字教育委員會當然要聯合教育家著作家出版界一致起來，努力於此。我今天（四月一十九日）在報上讀到一節新聞，大可供給我們從事識字教青之參考。</p>
<p>這節新聞是四月二十八日柏林路逐電報告德國將於本年內宣布公民法，其內政部長對人言：唯服務人民與國家，而證明其有能者，始能獲公民資格之榮譽，唯公民始能受公共職務，加入陸軍，並有投票權。凡受公民資格者，須宣誓效忠國家與元首，諸如卑陋之徒及國家之仇敵，均將划奪其公民資格。他又引希特勒之言：凡父母咸為日耳曼種，其人始為德人，而能為德國公民；其軀體必須強健，性格必須純良，必待軍役期滿後始授予公民資格。</p>
<p>德國行將公布的公民法，有幾個特點，就是：德國公民必須有強健的軀體，純良的性格；必須服兵役，守紀律，效忠終國家及元首。這幾點，我相信，凡是了解中國現狀及世界大勢，尤其是我們以常識指導及公民訓練為目的，來從事識字教育運動的人，所當加以深切注意的。</p>
<h3>識字教育運動與警察</h3>
<p>— 蔡勁軍</p>
<p>中華民國成立已二十四年，尚未能強盛；其原因雖多，但最主要的還是在於民智未開，識字者甚少。因此，政府的一切政令，大多數人民實不知有這回事；故在推行政令上就發生了許多的障礙。一個國家的政令，不能推行於大多數人民，其國那得不衰弱呢！所以，蔣委員長為救國與復興民族起見，認為須首先做推廣識字教育的工作，將全國百分之八十以上的文盲，完全廢除，務使全中國人民都能知道寫讀：故此，最近通令全國一致做廢除文盲的工作。中央復决定本年度的中心工作，為廢除全國的文盲。吳市長更决定於本年五月一日起在上海總動員開始實施識字教育，已為我們更週密的很完備的規定了，實施方案及督促辦法。現在我們唯一的責任，就是務必要按着計勸，依期實現。因為這個運動之成功與失散。是與國家之強弱，有非常重大的關係。警察是代表國家推行一切政令，不僅保護人民的生命財產，維持國家社會之安寗與秩序；而且對於人民一切有福利的事業，都要積極協助其發展，使臻於最完善的境地。故警察對這次識字教育運動，實負有重大的責任。我今站在警察的立場上，貢獻三點意見如下：</p>
<p>第一，在開始調查全市之識字與不識字的確實人數底工作時，我很誠懇的希望本市各界領袖以及一般識字的先生們，切實和我們警察合作，對於不識字者，盡力予以恊助，指示其入學之方法，手續及識字教育運動之重要意義，務使調查工作和勸導宣傳，在最短的規定之時間內，收到普遍而廣大的效果。</p>
<p>第二，我們推行識字教育工作時，必須根據週密的方案，完備的計劃，製定每日識字教育　度表，切實執行，一絲不苟，務使工作的成效，好要更好，精益求精。</p>
<p>第三，我們要互相負督促與考核的責任，能够盡責任的，我們勉勵他，希望他更盡責任；有不盡責任的，我們就要餐促他，務使他盡到責任；一次督促不聽，再次，再次不聽，三次，總要求到織字教育的工作，依照規定的計劃，以達最後之目的為止：若果真是冥頑不靈的，不可救藥的，我們就要很不客氣的，公布其姓名俾眾週知。因為真有這種不恥於人類，團體中之不良分子存在，不予以相當的處罰，正義是不張的。所以我們為要張正義，必須處罰這種怠懈的分子。</p>
<p>我認為以七三點意見，雖卑無高見，但覺得根實際。希望本市各界領袖和一般智識分子以及全體市民一致拿出最大的决心。貫澈始終的毅力在我們，吳市長領導之下實現中央識字教育的决議和，蔣委員長推廣識字教育的通令以及，市長實施識字教育的計劃，務使本市全體人民，在最短期間內，完全能够寫讀，這就是救國與復興民族的基礎。</p>
<h3>識字教育的回顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>— 蔣建白</p>
<p>識字動育的屬性：有人問識字教育這個名詞似乎不常聽說：把識字當做教育的一個分類，以為不妥，那末對於他的屬性，不得不有個解說，一般人以為形式的學校如小學，中學，大學，才是教育：進一步較廣的意義才把社會文化機關，各圖書館博物館等認為教育。其實照廣義的解釋，凡人類一切的活動，生活的各種形熊，都是教育，都有教育的價值，何况文字還是人類經騐記載的工具，如何識字，如何識得字的意義，當然為一種重要的教育無疑。識字不僅是涊識字音，所有字的涵義，及由字而組成的文句，都為教學上必有的過程，所以識字教育實包括常識訓練，公民訓練，而具有普通做事做人的道理在內。識字教育為國民之基本教育，為初期之書及教育，亦即所謂義務教育之一部分，所以，就人民之責任言開為義務，就國家之政策言則為強迫，識字教育實為成人補習教育及兒童義務教育二者之綜合的教育。</p>
<p>識字教育的過失：識字教育在清季幾無人注意，民元以後社會人士漸注意於此，或主利用簡字，或擬利用注音字母以為推行識字之工具；其場所則或推廣露天學校，或成立簡字學校，或推行公眾補習學校，及半日學校等，以為實施識字之機關，當時難因一部份人之努力，而有相當之成績，但以政府對於前清文盲無具體計劃，故其效果至微。其切實注意識字運動而着手宣傳者，為民國十八年識字運動宣傳計劃大綱之公佈。中央於規定各級黨部下層工作自治運動項中，列識字為七項運動之首，亦可見其特加注意。民國十九年教育部根據第二次全國教育會議决議，製定實施補習教育計劃，其為容有識字訓練，公民訓練，應用最少金錢，最短時間，使一般民眾，識字讀書，具有運用四權的能力，查全國不識字的民眾約占百分之八十，全國人口假定為四三六·〇九四·九五三人，不識字者共計三四八·八七五·九六二人。若以十六歲以上六十歲以下應受補習教育者約占百分之四十六·五，共計二〇二·七八四·一五三人，幾佔全民眾的半數，再加及年失學兒童約六千萬人，共計在二萬萬八千萬人須受最低限度之識字教育。政府雖定各項計劃，乃以經費人才，及實施者狃於畏難偷安之積習，坐使龐大之失學民來，依然故我。如此知識落後，程度幼稚之國民，以言挽救國族夕阽危，其何可期！</p>
<p>識字教育成功的條件：識字教育是一件重大的「事」，而荷此重大的一事」的責任還是「人」，過去識字教育之不能成功，「非不能也！是不為也」，不為的原因：第一是心理上少建設，以為知難行亦不易，故坐而不行：第二是無自信力，知識份子往往對他自己不能相信有多少能力。菲薄頹唐，何能負起教人的責任；第三是無實幹的精神，一般人說大話，吹大氣，真的呌他切切實實的去幹，那可不行了，這也可說是中國過去教育實質上的失敗。第四是不注重方法。做一件事是目的，要使這目的達到，方法自然要研究，何况複雜變化的人的環境，更非一成不變。不識字的民眾教學，比任何形式的學校教學，要困難幾倍，不從心理方面，環境方面，及事實方面去想辦法，一遇失敗，便說幹不通，那裏倉成功呢？上海市居有為之地，在此識字教育由運動而成為實施的時期中，大家要凜於過去非不能也的人為的失敗，自省自找，不蹈覆輒，故以成敗在「人」，使大家勉力。</p>
<p>識字教育初期完成後的施教：教學經騐的增長，在類化，在複習，此次識字教育不過為普及教育之初期，離普及預期之程度尚遠。所以在整個的第一期完成後，應有整個的第二期的計劃，繼續實施。在此計劃的每一期完成後，（即每期畢業後）應有分項分類有關教育的設施；如在已教過之字及課文加以引神，而為通俗圖畫刋物的編行，通俗演講集會的舉辦，識字或問字處的籌設，均為類化和演習不可少的工作；前者應仍由政府之力，通籌辦理，後者不得不希望以社會之力，合作促成，使此識字教育工作，能收實際化的功效。</p>
<h3>本會工作之回顧與展望</h3>
<p>— 陶百川</p>
<p>本會成立於四月一日·而實際開始辦公則在四月六日·若以重要工作為標準來劃分時期，則四月份可以說是計劃時期，五六兩月可以說是籌備時期，七月以後可以說是實施時期。</p>
<p>西諺說得好：「開始做得好，一半已成功」，計劉的重要，當然不下於籌備和實施，所以過去二十幾天的工作，差不多絞盡了我們的腦汁。而且大規模的推行識字教育，不獨上海，就是中國也還是創舉，所謂前無古人而後有來者，—因為前無古人，所以我們無可借鑑；因為後有來者，所以我們更不敢草率，免得因我們的失敗而關斷了識字教育的門戶。</p>
<p>經過二十幾天的努力，我們好容易建立了全部的計劃。在組織方面，我們樹立了兩個系統：一是本會的總辦事處，下設二十二個區辦事處和二百二十個識字學校及其開設的一千三百二十個識字班；還有一個是識字教育服務團，下設三百個分團預備吸收一萬個團員，以為識字學校的補助。在宣傳方面，我們計劃了一個宣傳週，現在正在積極進行。在調查方面。我們預備動員所有的地保，戶籍警察，識字學校考取的教育，以及各區公私立學校年長學生，發揮勞動服務的精神，大規模的調查全市不識字民眾，此外，然了試騐我們的理想，我們設置了兩個實騐區，現在已有十校可招生開學。預算也已編定了，總數是十七萬元左右，其中教員的薪金和服裝費，約計十一萬元。教材是我們自已編輯的，內容包含文字教育，常識指導和公民訓練，印刷費非常便宜，平均每　祇費了一分二釐半大洋。</p>
<p>籌備時期的工作，最重要的是調查不識字民眾，其次是訓練師資，再次是宣傳，再次是招生及籌備開學，而織字教育服務團分　　　的完成，也是重要工作之一種。現在宣傳　　自五月一日開始，七日即可結束，但　　　　人民間，以後尚須賡續宣傳。調查工作須定三星期完竣，五月十四日即將開始，各區　　　調查委員會主持辦理：以江灣實騐區的經騐　論，將來成績必甚可觀，師資訓練　　　　　竣後舉行，時間大約是三星期：訓練　　　　派赴各區籌備開學。</p>
<p>到了七月一日各區識字學校多可上課，識字教育服務團團員也可開始找尋不識字民眾，施以個別教學，而由分團團長擔任各該民眾的集合訓練；本會的工作就這樣從籌備時期而踏入實施時期了。</p>
<h3>識字教育之中心使命</h3>
<p>— 陳公素</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>現在是一個以智力角逐的世界：一國國勢之強弱，和她識字人民的數目成正比例，我們可以說，世界上沒有識字人民少的強國，而衰弱的國家，教育總是不普及，識字的人民是一定少的，因為文字是獲得知識的最重要的工具，認識文字的便可以運用他的力量，以尋求知識，充實他生話的內容，不涊識文字的便失去了一種知識的門徑，便不能够得到應有的發展，便减少了國家的力量。</p>
<p>我們中國就幅圓之廣大，人口之眾多，物產之豐饒，各點而論，本當雄視環球，領袖列邦，乃因數千年來歷受愚民政策，和官僚教育的毒害，一般人都以讀書識字不過是一部份人應有的權利和義務，於是社會上不識字人民的數目非常可驚！據估計，我們中國人民識字的不是佔百分之二十，其餘百分之八十以上都是不認識文字的愚昧之羣。在這種情形之下，許多個人的生活，事實上，平添無限困難，而社會亦因之不易改進，結果便使得中國成了一個大而不強的國家，受盡屈辱，不得平等，不能自由！</p>
<p>所以，我們要求國家民族的平等自由，就不能不求人民知識的提高，因此就不能不以迅速的手法，為掃除文盲的運動。現在本市已定於本年七月三日起實話強迫識字教育，這無疑的是一件最切實際的救國工作，凡屬市民，不可不各盡所能促其成功的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>對於本市強迫識字教育，市民均有出力推進，以達成　鉑目的責任，其理既明，所以除了負統　計　　識字教育委員會以及教育行政機關以外，無論是公務員，自由職業者，教育者，一切　　份子以及各個民眾團體，如各　　大公會，各工會，各　　會，各教育等等，實在都有　　　　　　　以恊助政府舉行識字教育　　，論　　　　方式；或則參加　　服務團，或則自辦識字學校，或則捐輸資財以辦理識字學校均無不可；所要者，在大家認識這種工作之急迫需要，與夫自己對於這種工作應盡的責任而能切實去做是了。</p>
<p>我們知道，中國不譏字的百分之八十以上的人數當中，實以農工份子居多，所以識字教育的對象，自然以農工羣眾為最重要了。基此理由，我們不能不希望農村中，工廠裏，都有充分的施行識字教育的機會，我們貢獻智力財力的時候，就不能不於此加以注意，我們以為工廠方面，應該由工會和工廠，雙方合力辦理以收協作之效。同業公會方面若所在地屬於商業區域不易招考學生，儘可出資委任識字教育委員會代為設立學校，即以出資之同業公會定所辦識字學校的名稱。而各區農會教育會至少要設置識字學校一所。以上所述是我們協助政府的辦法的一班，我們羣策羣力通力合作，方能使這偉大的運動。事半功倍。</p>
<p>不過，教們在這裏更要提到的，就是識字教育心理上的建設。俗語說：不識人，寸步難行，不識字，天下去得。這雖然是流俗之見，但其影響所及，足使一般平民减少其對於識字之信念，而且社會上不少人以為如葉澄衷楊斯盛輩初未曾識之無，亦能在社會上獲得相當的成功，他們不曉得像葉楊諸人，其有高人一等的志願和毅力，他們若不認識字，知識多，那他們的成功當更加偉大　就以為不識字既然可以成名，那麽識字與否又何足重要！所以我們在識字教育的宣傳勸導之中，非打破這種錯誤的觀念不可！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>講到識字教育的內容，那是包括文字教育，常識指導，與公民訓練三個部份。文字教育部份，包含六百個字的教學，這一些字，自然不够生活的需要，祇能說是聊勝於無。而常識之灌輸，公民之訓練尤其重要。以個人的見地說，則識字教育的中心使命，可謂實寄於公民訓練之上。</p>
<p>我們認識字運動就是救國運動。要民眾識字，是要使他們能瞭解救國的大道理，然後實行去，「效」的工作，文宇是不過求知的工具，我們的目的是要民眾拿這工具來獲得生沽的常識，以增進其個人的幸福，更要緊的是接受公民訓練，明瞭國家民族的地位，認識本黨的使命，認識三民主義的涵義，以負起國民革命的責任來。明乎此，然後，識字教育，才能發揮其至上的作用，才有其至高的價值的。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>綜上所述，可知識字教育意義之重大，我們的責任及協助政府進行的辦法，以及識字教育的中心使命。處此第一次世界大戰的前夜，我們有光榮的文化的中華民族，不圖生命之持續則已，若猶企圖着將來之生存，難道還可以因循坐誤，不趕快把民眾喚醒起來，勉力掙扎奮鬥，以挽回弱小民族的危機嗎？識字教育便是喚起民眾的一種工作，願有志救國的同志同胞，團結起來，完成這件工作，緊緊地把握住現實，以保持過去的榮譽，以開展前途的光明</p>
<h3>提倡識教之僱主責任</h3>
<p>— 馬崇淦</p>
<p>上海市為掃除全市文盲，自七月一日起。實施強迫識字教育一年。其意義非為單純之文字教育，乃為常識指導公民訓練三者合一之救國運動，凡為市民，皆當以全力贊助之。</p>
<p>推行識字教育之辦法，早已詳細規定，如能按序辦理，必得良果。茲就管見所及，提出一事，藉資參考。</p>
<p>查本市商店工廠之學徒司務，及家庭之僕役，不識字者比比皆是，即稍識之無，而尚未識滿七八百字毫無公民常識者，實居多數。若輩均應受識字教育，凡商店工廠之經理及家庭之主人，應令其於工作之睱入識字學校，或不便入校，商店工廠可擇職員中之優秀者任識字教育服務團團員，於適當時間教授之。家庭中之僕役，可由主人或子女担任教師，切勿諉謂職工每日識字一小時績恐妨礙工作，不令受最低限度之教育。常知聯工識字後，深明大義，能力增加，對於工作，自必動奮，為民族，為職工，為僱主均有裨益，謂予不信，請讀以下之事實。</p>
<p>民八，不佞參與五四運動，竭力提倡義務教育，勸導各校學生會及各路商界聯合會開辦義務學校，即令族中開設商店內之學徒，入義務學校肆業，不料經理以妨礙工作為理由，出面反對，但仍堅令入學，一年後，學徒智識增加，工作進步，其中一人業已升任協理，辦事精幹，此可見商店令學徒受教育獲益之一斑。</p>
<p>以上所述，為不佞經歷之事實，在此識字教育宣傳週，或可作為參考歟？</p>

<h3>對於西裝的商榷</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>海上人士穿西裝的，約佔什之四五，實在穿西裝比了中裝，便捷而又經濟，無怪人們紛紛的改裝，恐不久的將來，在四十歲以下的男子，找不到一個穿中裝的了。把便捷來講，在家中上樓下樓，在途間上車下車，都沒有拖泥帶水的弊病，就是出門旅行，備了一件大衣，也就可以了。把經齊來講，中裝有皮的，駱駝絨的，襯絨的，夾的，單的，須隨着時令而更換，這筆衣着費就很可觀了，至於西裝，春秋和冬季，祇須一套，便可敷衍彰身，不過冬季加穿一件厚大衣，春秋穿薄大衣罷哩，夏季的西裝，置備更為溶易，甚至精明朋友，到吳淞路去揀一身，化了十多塊錢，一切附屬品都有了，走到街上，居然趾高氣昂，為新時代的代表人物。</p>
<p>可是西裝的作料，脫不了呢和絨兩項，那呢絨完全為舶來品，金錢流到外國，歲不可以數計，記得鄙人前年擔任某女校的課程，一位很促狹的女生，故意問怎樣可以富國，鄙人不假思索的回答，第一要國人不買外國貨，女生接着說：旣然如此，那麽先生為什麼要穿西裝？問得鄙人瞪目結舌，幸而下課時間已到，便乘此假痴假呆的下墳。鄙人何嘗不想把國產的原料來做西裝，可是國產的原料，穿在身上，不到幾時，那領端衣角，會得不由自主的捲起來，很不服貼，深願我國實業家從事織品的，努力加以研究，藉以挽回利權。</p>
<p>西裝的袖口外，往往有幾個沒有扣的紐兒，　時很有許多人討論它的用處，可是討諭得一些沒有結果，鄙人總覺得這是贅物，可以除去。還有西裝的褲兒，總是做的很長，脚管上折疊一重，俾於步履上，不致有所妨碍，鄙人以為興其折疊，母寗當初做得短些，幷且折疊了，這折縫中積塵藏垢，很不衛生，有百害而無一利，還不如廢去這種制式的好。</p>
<h3>新家庭的幻滅</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>同居的沈先生，本來是獨身的，在去年的秋季裏，和陽女士發生了戀愛關係了。經了半年的戀愛時期，便訂下了海枯石爛，偕老白頭的婚約，而假座某大酒樓，正式結婚，而實行小家庭的同居生活。沈先生是一位高尙人物，楊女士是一位高材生，珠聯璧合，眞是天造地設的一對，沒一個不歎羨着美滿姻緣。</p>
<p>結婚之後，夫唱婦隨的十分和睦，笑聲琴韻，常從他們的房裏播出來。但是這麽地過了一個月的某一個晚上，琴聲寂然了，笑聲也沒有了，代之以夫婦倆的爭執聲。到了半夜，才靜止下來。下一天，沈先生是一早的匆匆出外去辦公，楊女士也不似往日那麽的常把笑意掛在嘴角上。</p>
<p>據他家的老媽子說，他們爭執的原因，是為了一句說話的搶白。</p>
<p>匆匆地一天，是溜過去了。晚上，沈先生回來得很遲。一到家，夫婦倆又繼續的爭執着。到了半夜，打起架來了。就在天將發白的時候，楊女士賭氣回母家去。沈先生在伊臨行時，恨恨地嚷道：「你去了，不用再回來。」</p>
<p>過了一星期，這一對夫婦，便在調解法庭上出現了。雙方都請着律師，楊女士方面，還呈騐着醫生給簽證的傷單。經法官的一陣子調解之後，在互相同意的條件之下，簽字離婚了。</p>
<p>從此，沈先生依然是度着獨身的生活。他說：「結婚是戀愛的墳墓！」</p>
<h3>海軍　造　競争</h3>
<h3>賭博的故事</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>賭博本是件壞事，可以傾家蕩產。但有幸運的遇着，有時也可以興家。不過就是少數，不足為訓的。現在把這因賭博而破產而起家兩件故事；記在下面，聊供閱者談助。</p>
<p>在下的故鄉，有家親戚金姓。他家裏，本有良田數百畝。在上海南市熱鬧地方，也置有幾幢市房。但現在這些房產，早已換了主人了。原來在數十年前；金姓的祖父，一天在大除夕，請了幾位親友吃年夜飯。等到席散，主人一時高興。便和一位至友某君，作擲骰之戲。大家說明以某處房產為注，作孤注之一擲。而金姓作注的，便是上面所述的幾幢房屋。結果，金姓給一把骰子輸了。那房產，從此過戶易姓。後來某君因為和金姓是要好朋友，說明房租每年仍歸金姓收取若干。等到臨終的時候，還有遺囑，呌子孫世守弗替。所以直到現在，金姓還每年到滬，向業主收一千多元的租金，而且並沒有契據。從前每年祇有幾百千，嗣因地價日漲，才加到了這數，但還不到現租金的五分之一咧！</p>
<p>在下前有個同居洪某家素貧。本是在一家骨牌店裏執業，每月祇購幾塊錢的薪工。要想成家立業，怎能談得到。有一年的年關到了，他得到幾十塊錢，就到一個總會裏賭博。屢戰屢勝，一連幾日，倒贏了二三千塊錢，於是他便把這筆錢，要妻成家。再合了幾個股束，也開了一爿骨牌舖。幾年來，各業都喊若不景氣。他的營業，却很有起色，年有盈餘。人家都說笑他；倘不是當日身入博塲，那有討老婆和做老闆的資格呢？</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>我這一進去，又讓我看到一件奇怪的事，，就是這學生們，有三四個人，伏在士堦上，將鉛筆寫字。近去看時，乃是拿了別人的抄本，照樣抄上自己的抄本。我就問他為什麽這樣一早就抄書？他說：到了上午，同學自己要用抄的本子，就不能借給別人抄了。我說，為什麼不到課堂上去抄呢？他說，課堂上的朋友，正在抄黑板上的算式，分開來抄，免得攪亂在一處。我說，你睡覺的屋子裏也可以抄了。他說，屋子裏太黑，看不見抄書。而且一屋子裏有七八個人睡覺，只有兩張櫈子，一張小桌子，也不能坐許多人。他這不是假話。他們有一部分人往在窰洞裏，其黑可知。那住在房屋裏的，小小的窗戶，再蒙上一塊藍布，實在也和窰洞黑的差不多。因為玻璃這樣東西，是西方缺少之物，人家窗戶上，絕對談不到用玻璃。若是用紙來糊窗戶吧？無奈又是括風的日子太多，每括一塲風，可以把窗戶紙吹個稀爛。周有容笑道：你這有一點形容過甚。我們東方，也有括大風的日子，不見得有了風窗紙，就不能存在。志前道：我的縣長，你是在有樹木的地方做老爺，那知道無樹木的地方，人民蓋房子，是盡量的節省木料呢？他們的窗戶，决不能像東方房屋裏約窗戶，用精細的木料，做那緊密的窗格子。（一九六）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>不過這裏所紮繡的花樣，不能和鞋面上一般的層出不窮，不概只能限制於蝴蝶和蝙蝠兩種，別的雖然也未必一定不能用，但用上去了，想來也是不會怎樣好看的。</p>
<p>太后足上的鞋襪，我已經是論得很淸楚了；至於伊的穿法那是和尋常的旗人相同的。襪子約比鞋牆高出三四寸，用一根細軟的綢帶，先自緊紥在腿部上，然後再把褲脚管拉下來，套在襪統上，再用一根綢帶紮縛起來；這根綢帶的顏色總是和褲子本身的顏色相同的，多半還是一段料子上裁下來的。這種紮褲脚的方式，經我們此刻想起來，必然是非常難看的，然而在從前時候，大家都如此，倒也不覺得什麼異樣；而且因為有了這兩重的紮縛，不但那襪子决不會皺攏，便是那褲管也從不會散開來的，所以行動時永遠會使你覺得很乾凈爽利。</p>
<p>因為有這麽許多的鳳鞋和緞襪，需要賴着那些製鞋的女工們的雙手造作出來，所以這一班姑娘雖然在形式上或階級上都和宮內的宮女約略相同，但實際上是大有分別的！宮女在宮內是一些沒有什麼地位的，竟可說比太監都不如，種種粗重的工作，伊們都有份，簡直是整日在忙着侍候別人，而當藝工的却不但不需去服侍人家，並且還有指定的太監為伊們服役咧！（三〇六）</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>孔林古跡略記</h3>
<p>— 祝融氏</p>
<p>孔林是孔子埋骨之所，也是曲阜古跡之一，在曲阜城的北門外三里之遙，津浦路的曲阜車站，所以要建築在離曲阜城十八里的遠，也因為了孔林，怕車輛的經過，震動了孔子的墳墓，這便是尊重孔子的一個表示吧！</p>
<p>出了曲阜城的北門，便可以瞧見一帶的長松巨柏，古雅蒼翠的分植在進孔林的行人道兩邊，這也可以表現孔子之學的偉大，經過了二里路的松柏夾道，現出了一處脾樓式的大門，門上寫的是孔林兩個大字，這就是孔林的入口處了，進了孔林的門，兩旁築着粉色的短牆，植着參天的松柏，同行人道上的有一般的大小，再走進去，有孔子的享殿，殿前分立了幾對的石刻物像，這是古時墳墓所必有的物件。</p>
<p>在轉灣進孔林的地方，有下馬碑，在專制時代，無論軍民官員，到這塊碑前，便不能冉用代步的馬或轎車，孔子的尊嚴，在這一點上，可以完全表現出來。</p>
<p>在孔林之內，所瞧見的，便是許多孔氏的墳墓，每一個墳前，都立着墓碑，註明着墓內埋骨的人名。正中的一個，是異常的偉大和雄壯，墓碑也特別的高大，這自然是孔子的墓地了，碑上刻着至聖先師孔宜王的字樣，瞻仰孔林的人，到了這裏，自然起了敬仰的心意，知道這墳墓之內，是萬代宗師孔子埋骨的所在。孔子墓前的一個墳墓，便是述聖子思子的墳墓，是傳孔子之學的偉人。其餘的墳墓，都是孔氏一門，最使人感觸的，却是一個中興之墓，孔子的一脈，可以傳到今日，仍存留着衍聖公的宗支，虧得了這位中興的功臣，有一段可歌可泣的事跡，至今還盛稱於曲阜全城。</p>
<p>孔子死後，子貢守墓，早流傳了這一慕可敬的事跡，在孔墓的後面，造着一個土台，和幾間房屋，台上就立着一塊子貢守墓的石碑，可以知道這便是當年子貢守墓所住的地方。子貢手植楷，是子貢在守墓時所種的一枝，如令却已完全枯乾的了，外面用鐵圈箍着，短牆圍住，看了不過使人發生一種感想，成為一點古跡而已。</p>
<p>在孔林墳地裏面，參天的松柏，不知多少，越發的使得孔林莊嚴和古雅，看了孔子墳前的墓碑，使人想到孔子之學的偉大，其所以成為萬代師表，也不是偶然的啊！</p>

<h3>五四運動紀念論梁漱溟</h3>
<p>— 李麥麥</p>
<p>「東西文化及其哲學」</p>
<p>梁漱溟　著商務出版　九角</p>
<p>現在又是一個重新估計過去一切思想價值時期。假如說，在現在這個時期，對於五四時代比較進步的思想領袖如胡適，我們都應加以嚴格的批評，那麽，對於五四時代落後的思想家如梁漱溟的著作，是更不應該輕易放過。何况梁漱溟的著作在現在已成為復古派的無上法　。</p>
<p>梁漱溟的「東西文化及其哲學」，從思想上說，牠是中國的傳統思想在近代思想威逼之下之試圖返老還童，從歷史說，牠不過是舊中國在新中國前面之死前回光反照。</p>
<p>當中國走入新時代之入口時，有兩個有思想才能的中國人都試圖以西洋哲學和科學來使枯老的傳統的中國思想童化青年化，道兩個人，一個是『仁學』的著者譚嗣同，一個就是『東西文化及其哲學』的著者梁漱溟。雖然，這兩個人都是從同一出發點來發揮傳統哲學，但他們的歷史意義不是沒有分別的，不，他們的分別是極其顯然的。</p>
<p>假如說，譚嗣同生吞活剝地以西洋思想和科學來童化中國傳統哲學是含有進步的意義，那麽，梁漱溟的類似的工作却只有反動意義。假如說，譚嗣同的『仁學』對於當時的『維新』運動是演着推動作用，那麽，梁漱溟的『東西文化及其哲學』即完全是五四新文化運動之反動。梁漱溟本人雖未直接參加利立論戰，但梁漱溟却是當時玄學方面的頭子。</p>
<p>除却上述的內在的原因外，大戰後的歐洲頹廢思想之猖獗也是促進梁漱溟敢於來見笑大方的重大原因之一。辜鴻銘，太戈爾，乃至梁啟超之所以見稱於當時的歐洲者，是因為當時的歐洲正處在大病垂危之際，因此，牛鬼神蛇式的東方思想在歐大盛一時，這，才使梁漱溟敢發出以東方文化來挽救西方文化的宏願。我們曉得，這在實際上只是使有知識的歐洲人向中國人發笑！</p>
<p>梁漱溟的根本錯誤，决不如胡適所說，是在他不該求東西文化『整個』性，倒是相反，求文化之整個性，是研究文化的思想家的　　　。因為無論任何文化，都是整一體的　　　氣七八糟的文化單件之堆積。胡適以中國人『吃米飯』『筷子』來反對梁漱溟『把定一條綫』去了解東西文化是完全錯誤的。</p>
<p>梁漱溟的根本錯誤在甚麽地方呢？在他的東方式玄學方法上，在他的東方玄學方法把變化的發展的進步不已的有時因民族於階級原因而又能倒退的東西文化及其哲學殭化為三個一成不變的空洞原則。這種方法完全是荀子的﹃古今一度雖久同理』的思想之再版，完全是反歷史的反科學的。</p>
<p>照梁漱溟所說，西洋文化的根本精神是意欲向前，假如梁漱溟這句話是指文藝復興以後的毆洲文化而言，則一千年以上的停滯的歐洲中世文化生活梁漱溟又作何解釋呢？又如梁漱溟說中國文化是意砍綢和為原，然而我們一考秦後中國文化發展牠是全然按着曲綫進行的，牠上升又下降，下降後又上升，梁漱溟又作何解呢？</p>
<p>梁漱溟的錯誤，就在他把某一民族的特定階段特定社會的統治思想當作各民族之全部文化史的發展原理。所謂意欲調和的中庸之道，决不是中國的將產物，假如梁漱溟讀過亞里斯多德的『倫理學』，他當能知道亞民的中庸之道並不减於孔子的中庸之道，所謂中庸之道，牠不過是古代貴族的改良思想表現，有甚麽了不得的大妙道呢？</p>
<p>為梁漱溟所驚異不置的西洋的意欲向前的道路，也决不是西洋所特有，這種思想，時不論古今，地不論中外，只要那裏有了資本主義和資產階級的發展，牠一定是要產生的。古代印度的唯物論和中國的楊朱韓非等何嘗不是主張意欲向前的？</p>
<p>再就意欲向後說，牠也不是印度的特產品。假如梁漱溟研究過埃及沙漠中隱士希臘羅馬的斯多亞派和中國的莊子陳仲子，他便知這中國和西洋的意欲向後也不减於印度的苦行僧。由此，我們可以知道，意欲持中，向前於向後只是特定社會的三種不同的階級心理表現，根本不能作為中國西洋印度各民族文化永久原理。</p>
<p>雖然上述三原則，有時能在某一民族特別能維持其支配權，然而牠却是由社會經濟發展或不發展决定了的，斷乎不是由這三個抽象原則來决定各民族的文化形態和生活態度。</p>
<p>梁漱溟這種倒果為因的說法，全然因為他是一個中印合璧的唯心論者呀！</p>
<h3>各書局印象記</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>商務—中華—世界</p>
<p>（一）商務印書館——書局是什麽？商務印書館——有二大部份人，都把Cgwmon　noun的書局，同化於Proher　noun的商務印書館在一九二五年以前，商務印書館確是唯我獨尊，以老大自居。</p>
<p>國民革命的怒潮推動了文化的巨輪，新書業隨新文學與新社會科學以俱起，四馬路上，書店蜂起，曾有一個時侯，進步的青年，除買教本以外，足跡不到商務印書館。而商務印書館並不「隨波逐流」，大家說：「哼，商務是沒落了！」</p>
<p>但是，不久，情形轉變，商務坐視着大批小書局的封門與倒閉，而其自己還是屹然。</p>
<p>「一二八」日本的鐵鳥啄毀了整個的商務。世界開明的教本，在商務停業期中，莫不利市三倍，甚至有以商務的後補者自居的。大家以為，商務是很難恢復了。</p>
<p>然而，日本的鐵鳥固然毀壞了商務許多物質，但同時也毀懷了商務過去根深蒂固的「生產關係」（恕我亂用了這個名辭。）復業後的商務，在一個新的基礎上，更是飛躍的邁進。東方雜誌，教育雜誌，又在雜誌銷數上佔了首席。</p>
<p>商務印書館……每日新書……兒童文庫……四庫全書！王雲玉……」（商務又成為書業中的巨靈，且是各書店的最大威脅者。</p>
<p>（二）中華書局——資格差不多和商務印書館一般的老。但我們在直覺上看不見什麽，除了儀器和字畫。是的，中華的主要營利的東西是儀器用具，除了那塊廠址地產以外。</p>
<p>在出版方面，我們很難看出中華有什麽特色。在新文學盛極一時的時候，中華刋出了徐志摩主編的中華文藝叢書的廣告。直到徐志摩死了，文學書的潮流過去了，我們才看見那幾本叢書姍姍而來。「新中華教科書」，曾行銷一時，但教部的暫行課程標準「過時」，這套書也隨之黯然。</p>
<p>但，在許多定期刋物中，我們不能不推崇新中華是比較進步的。短小精悍，而且有時還有幾篇非「名人題字式」的學術性文字，尤以過去第一卷為甚。</p>
<p>（三）世界書局——在數量上，規模之大，世界無變的是老三，在以前，提起世界書局，我們就聯想到紅房子，紅玫瑰，江湖奇俠傳，什麽艷史，哀史，導等。</p>
<p>不久，世界有個很快的進步，不但中小學教課書出版了很多，（而且往往每種書二本，更是特色，）就是二三十萬言的大學教科書也出版了許多。有一時期，世界和商務一步一趨，競爭很烈，商務有大學叢書，世界亦有，商務有每日新書，世界亦然，有時，世界且超越商務，如世界小學教科書，某年秋季開學在某地由所謂教師聯合會所批定的分數，比商務中華的都高。</p>
<p>但是，世界有許多特色，還是令人莫測高深。如世界銀行啦，大華書局啦，世界出版合作社啦，真如羣星之環列，為其他書局所望塵莫及。</p>
<p>世界的出版方向轉變，是由於「ABC」的利市三倍，然而也許即為此故吧，一般人對於世界的各書，即使是極高深的大學叢書，仍免不了「ABC」之感。</p>

<h3>話在藝展預會之外</h3>
<p>— 張鳳</p>
<p>在中國銀行舊址的英倫中國藝術預展會，總算是看過了。別人說內中陳列的是二三等貨，我說那些銅器磁器倒也不差，值得一看。可惜我是帶了一大羣學生去的，去時指示口答，忙個不了，簡直不由我仔細察看。他們問我兩三句，我祇答覆得一二句，已儘够化去半天的時光，百通百曉做不成，打對折，做一個五十通五十曉算了。</p>
<p>「張先生吓！你看這富春山居圖吓！嚴子陵的釣臺在那裏？」話也凑巧，春假一星期，我是忽發奇興，獨自一個到過那兒去溜一趟的，現在名畫在前至少要賞他一眼的，所謂「錦屏繡嶂」的山色，倒也依稀仿彿，十得一二。那最妙不過的回洑濚瀾，是七里　勝處，沒有見到，想卷子沒有完全展開被掩沒去了罷？</p>
<p>說到嚴子陵釣台，那問題就來了。兩塊方整廣大象碉堡樣式的磐石，矗立在七八十丈高的山坡上，說是可以釣魚，那真比「緣木求魚」，更要不可能。釣綸要如何長，釣的魚又是如何大？多少痴人與詩人，正在那「近似而不可能」的想象中間，發他們痴與做他們的詩。實在，這問題也很簡單答覆如下：</p>
<p>嚴子陵富春江人，隱居釣魚，是可有的——然而蘇州某地，也有嚴子陵釣台，應考——釣魚豈可在一處——釣魚何必有台，搭什麽山林的臭架子——總是因光武帝的捧場，而後人又捧光武帝的場，找一個地方來用以紀念這番勝事，磐石遂因以當選——當選的時候，還在李白以後罷——因為李白詩有「請留磐石上垂釣上，垂釣將已矣」那兩句話，遂造成這典故的——可是磐石有兩塊——再把一塊贈給謝　羽作一個紀念，也未為不可。</p>
<p>富春山居圖的後面，是一卷長江無量圖，另外宋太祖大宗像，都可以使人抬矚，逗人說話，祗我因為要說在會場以外的，就可以擱住不說。</p>
<p>看銅器——俗語說得好：「窮！雖窮，還有三萬六千銅」這可以當題贈該室的名句麽？我說銅器室選列的器物很好，遇到內家的老友，周金文存的作者，鄒安老先生他是這樣說，可見非我一人之私言。生坑，熟坑，一件件，一羣羣，有字，有花，不是禮器，賃器，明器；而是容器，溫器，烹飪器以及尋常用器。改混雜不清的所謂敦；而用郭沬若考定的稱為　。這里却費去我不少口舌，和學生們指示解說，說話都在會內此處可以擱住不贅——而所謂尋常用器這名詞似乎太泛，還要留着斟酌一下，可不必有此一類。內中，即尋常用器內有一件，八二號，蟠虺紋鑑，標明戰國時器，器中有一圖案文，為時下所稱為「四合如意」樣式的圖案。有此圖案的他器，如山西離石縣石刻，敝處所藏塗金「四合如意」銅片，及殘錫製小花片，皆與是器中的圖案吻合。此種圖案，我曾考為是寶勝，金勝，方勝花勝綵勝等名，是否為戰國時已有此圖案，尚未考定，寶勝是一問題，如意是一問題，應分開來說。諭到如意一節，英人Hopkins在一九二三年通報上做過一篇長文，謂是由佛教傳來的，若論為寶勝，或不至為霍氏的討論所拘束罷！</p>
<p>新鄭的銅器羣——那有字的「王子嬰次……」一器，不預選，很失望。看這羣銅器的制作，北方的采色，尚保存濃厚，當出土後，有人疑為楚器而播越在中州的，恐非！</p>
<p>壽縣銅器羣——一〇六號，爼，確是剏見。爼中四十字形，未必「蓋以泄汁」，如說明書上所述，恐用以薰烤魚肉麽？——一〇八號環梁方盤有銘九字，與敵處藏一殘豆上字相同——一〇五號楚王龕肯鼎有銘十二字與二十三年一月滬上發見之壽縣大銅鼎邊上所有文字相同。壽縣銅器發見之初，聞譚天先生告我說，頗有失散，不盡藏在安徽圖書館。敝處所藏殘豆的來歷，成一笑話，即夜二十二年十二月，從滬賈撒某手中買來，付價定當，藏之亦既有日，把玩時總有懷疑之處，從新退貨回錢，再隔一年，而憶及其文字，又再去買來。今與一〇八號對勘，所有文字，不識者仍舊不識，容庚氏楚器圖輝不知如何識法，待查。</p>
<p>最後看到中央研究院的考古選例兩玻廚，惜說明書尚未到會，要待我再破費若干錢，再去覆看。內中骨製斧與矛類已引起我的注意，而未得結果，待去再看後，再說罷！</p>
<p>於此有一非分請求：中央研究院屢次發掘，其所發表者，尚屬少數。何不開一大規模之公開展覽，使人也得一嘗禁臠呢？</p>

<h3>短波另件（續）</h3>
<p>— 汪盛世</p>
<p>在高週率時，電流幾會沿導綫表面通過，故綫圈上鍍蓋之物為須加以審愼。因為銀是最易傳電的金屬，所以鍍銀的導綫曾用來做過短波綫圈。但在射電週率上銀的互導（Conductvity）較銅所大甚微，所以一般仍用後者來做導綫。漆包綫的優點也很多，最主要者為其表面常保　光亮，不易養化。若有大量高李電流　過者，如業發射機的屏極電路，則應採用空心鋼管，外面塗漆，以防養化。這　鋼管不能鍍鎳，據實騐知這樣可以把導綫的高週率耗阻增加約八倍。反之，銅　管鍍錫並不影響其耗阻，像普通商業上鍍錫的厚度，其耗阻僅略為增加而已。</p>
<p>在裝置方面講，綫圈應繞得牢固，以免在使用時發生振動而致改變收音機的常數。凸筋式圈架，上面刻着適當的蝶紋，可以避免這種鬆動。或是在　架上刻槽，把導綫繞在槽內亦可。若需用挿入式綫圈，則圈底的釘必須牢固，不使鬆脫。</p>
<p>在一短波收音機中，對於損失而言，最可惡者卽為配諧電容器。此電容器必須損失極小，但除非在選擇這另件時加以相當注意，常易引入損失。有時其高週率電阻竟較與其配合之綫圈的電阻尙高。關於這點，自以用空氣為誘電體者最合用，配諧電容器以紙為誘電體者，完全不能採用。</p>
<p>與綫圈一樣，當一配諧電容器接入綫路後，一部分能力亦消失其中。第一由於片間的眞正漏電損失，弟二由於電壓變化時誘電體所生的損失。</p>
<p>所以吾們可以把一隻配諧電容器看做一個純粹電容量，其電流導前電壓九十度，及一無自戚量的電阻R和他並聯（圖二甲）</p>
<p>由數式的計算，我們可以把這個並聯電阻R變成一個相當串聯電阻　和遇率的平方成反比。在高週率時，這r的價極小，故知所有損失，大概均由誘電體吸收而生。</p>
<p>配諧電容器，其支持片子的誘電體愈少愈佳，這種誘電體必須適用於高週波方可。他的金屬片子應用銅製，每組都應　牢，這點非常重要，因為普通都用襯圈填空，若襯圈養化，效力就要减小o電容器旋軸不能使其搖動，以免在旋轉時發生雜聲。</p>
<p>（三）配諧電容器的數値及其他</p>
<p>要避免電台的擁擠，配諧電容器的電容量不能大於一〇〇兆兆分法拉，卽·〇〇〇一兆分法拉。他的最大與最小電容量的比是愈大愈佳，然後用同一線圖可以配合得較寬的波滯。</p>
<p>在圖三中C和L是配諧自感量和極電容量　和　表示引線間和燈絲柵間的電容量。　大約等於五兆兆分法拉，　大約等於八兆兆分法拉o　　都能看做和C並聯。</p>
<p>若用一精密設計的電容器作為C，容量為一〇〇兆兆分法法拉。則其最小容量僅約五兆兆分法拉。所以這時最大與最小電容量的比是U3/18大約等於六比一。用一個固定的自感量，其配諧波長的範圍約為二·五比一。吾們假定這時的配諧範圍是從二〇米至五〇米。</p>
<p>現在我們若用一個設計不良的電容器，其最低容量設為二〇兆兆分法拉，那末最大與最小電容量的比僅為rr3/33，或三·口比一，庭細　翻讓個一·八此一。所以用一個比前節小一整的自威產，祇能配合從二〇到三六米的彼　。　動調節對於短彼接收很是重要，普還用一特殊設計的旋盤來管理他。</p>
<p>固定電容器和廣播收音樓沒有分別，不過要採用沒有　量者。</p>
<p>調變線圈之法亦可採用，但這種線圈的設計必須有　當技巧方可。接觸點必須　潔，以接收時發生雜音，或用久後電阻增加。圖四表示一種效力極高的調雙方法。注意初級柵極，再生　圈各有幾個，可以相互配合。這種線圈必須妥為設計、否則就要發生死點，在這些點上完全不能發生振　。</p>
<p>挿入線圈的脚和底座應有良好的接觸，而供絕緣用的誘電體亦須用適合於高週波者方可。底座各脚間的距離愈大愈佳，以减少漏電損失。</p>
<p>高週率阻流線圈的自感量應該很太而其自身電容量則須很小，同時其外面的電塲也須極小。因為這種線圈是用來放在線路中去阻往高週波的，所以同時還要用一個電容器去把這種電流漏到地面去。為了要得很高的自感量和很小的目身電容量，這種扼制線圈當當分段繞後再把他串聯，那末各自感量仍是相加，但是自身電容量則因串聯而減至很微。若收音機另件緊擠時，阻流線圈外應加屏蔽，以限制其所生的電塲。</p>
<p>配諧電容器的刻度盤對於接收時很有關係，所以必須用緩動式者。有些業餘者竟探用一〇〇與一的比例，但一般上十五與一的比例也很够了。</p>
<p>收音機的效力也要看再生控制是否恰當，作控制用的電容器必須沒有雜聲，最好也須採用緩動調節，這點對於接收遠地的電訊更為重要。（完）</p>

<h3>6A7五柵管收音機之介紹</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>此機之特點，在於用16A7五柵變波管·（Pentagrid　Converter）兼司檢波，及成音周率擴大之二重工作。前者，由其四極部份担任，後者，係利用其振盪柵，及陽柵兩極祖任。設計極為經濟，而成績亦頗可觀。收聽本埠各電臺，被揚聲器已可滿意。音量最大時，約相當於普通之三管機。選擇性亦頗佳。至用件，則力求飾省：裝置務使緊凑，，以成一玲瓏精美之袖珍收音機。</p>
<p>電源—此機以r2z3，作直接電源式之半波整流，以供給6A7屏壓。兩眞空管之燈絲可串連之，再連以耗阻R3而接至22ov進綫之××處。如欲更經濟，則可做成半交流式：僅須另覓一次級有六弗打輸出之電給變壓器，以燃點7A7燈絲：B電改用r35弗打之乾電。實際上，亦可得同樣之成績也。</p>

<h3>再生力收音機改成自動式的方法</h3>
<p>— 曹潤生</p>
<p>再生力式收音機，無論再生力用得太少或過度，均不能發揮其全能力。如用得太少則音量不大：過度則祇有呌聲而音聲反被掩沒。自動再生力式的要點是使調節波長時，同時也使再生力在一起校正，二步手續併在一起做。</p>
<p>本來有許多收音機再生力是用電容器來控制的，那末我們可以為一隻雙連　來管理波長和再生力，不是就能變成自動的了？不過理論上雖然不錯，在事實上管理再生力的電容器容量還嫌太大。因為普通雙連電容器最大容量大都是·〇靈魂〇三五或三六MFD，這個用來管理波長固然適合；用來管理再生力則尙嫌太大。使用時一定要覺得再生力和波長不能同步。所以我們還要串接一隻固定電容器便容量改小。這一雙電容器容量，據作着實騐結果以·〇〇一MFD為，最適宜。自直流單管機至交流四管機，均能在各波長叚得到穩定的再生力，並且有許多朋友也都試過，認為最合宜。</p>
<p>在上面的一張綫路是使用在一最普通的單管機上，在各式收音機上都能同樣配上，這裏不過是舉一個例子罷了！</p>
<p>使用時，先收請注意個波長最短的電臺，將再生圈漸漸移近次級圈，使得最大音量卽將振盪而未振盪，然後退後少許而固定之。這樣一來，波長和再生力都能同時校正，並且十分穩定。業餘向志不妨一試。</p>

<h3>莫斯科取締街頭乞童</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>二十四日國民社電莫斯科市政當局，近復在市區舉行大規模廓清乞童之舉，此等乞童，到處游散，情形至為可憐，已成為蘇俄社會上最嚴重之問題，據云，近三星期之內，莫斯科警察，四處搜索，已捕得無家可歸之兒童一千二百零二人，其中之一部分，已探悉其父母居住之所，當即送之還家，並向其父母警告，對其子女，應負有贍養之責，至於父母因漠視子女之生活而受警察之斥責之案件，竟達一萬一千三百起之多，其街頭乞兒被捕之後，無從尋覓其家屬者，即遣送公家局所撫養云。</p>
<p>從上面這一段事實，我們可以看出，實行共產主義社會的蘇俄，其社會的內部，至今還呈着種種的缺陷。第一、蘇俄的社會，是一個共產主義的社會。然而在這一個共產主義社會裏面，目下居然還有這許多到處游散，無衣無食，情形至為可憐的乞童存在。這不能不說是共產主義社會的蘇俄的一種最大的缺陷，莫怪牠要成為一個蘇俄社會上最重要的問題。第二。蘇俄的社會，一般人民，因為得到性的解放，致家庭觀念，日趨薄弱，父母子女之間的感情，日趨疏遠。這結果，就造成了這一千多個無家可歸的兒童，和這一萬多起的父母因漠視子女之生活而受警察之斥責的案件。這也是共產主義國家的蘇俄的一種缺陷。</p>
<p>莫斯科街頭這些給社會所遺棄的不幸的兒童，要是他們知道他們所立足的社會，是一個共產主義國家的社會，他們不曉得將作何感想？</p>
<h3>梅子味的心情</h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>人換上輕薄的單衫的時節，中空中也開始有了像人世間的流浪人一樣浮遊着的雲朶兒了：紛雜的，幻變的。那時候，不用向季節的記載上去聞訊，人誰都明白：開展在這龐大的世界上的，已經不再是紫色之幻夢一般的春天，二時：在紅的花叢裏綴着一兩點梅子的青色的五月了啊——五月是帶着許多可驚的不快意，也帶着呌人想起杜鵑的詩篇的酸味的。</p>
<p>（真的，已經不能再想，已經不能再想了啊。每年，當街上的人在春衫裏面顯出輕快地姿態，而深深的長巷裏飄起一兩聲梅子的販賣人的尖嗓子的當兒，人已經失掉了思索的機能，而僅存着一個不康健的心，喘息而垂斃的。</p>
<p>——已經又是梅子味的時分了啊。青色的酸味祗會給人帶來一種苦惱的對失去了的過往之追念的。但是這對於一種不適宜於悠思的人，僅僅是一種磨折，一種刑罰啊。）</p>
<p>想：到梅子成熟的時候，又該是自家兒走上教人發抖的生活的十字架上去的時分了。</p>
<p>已經是失掉了時與空之感覺的人了：能記憶得出的就只有一幅發出銀花一般燦爛的光綫的幼年之圖像；在這上面存在着親愛底人類的微笑，日光中的山泉水一般明淨的同年的心，還有，點綴在聖地般的小小的村子裏的果樹園（我是在那兒開始認識了梅樹，也在那兒開始見到已經湮落在記憶之坑底裏的她的。）親切而並不富麗的古老的家門前的大椽子，妻息在屋檐下面的鴉巢，和許多仲夏的牧歌味的黃昏。</p>
<p>（可是現在，這一個小小的和平的世界是已經完全毀掉了：毀在炮火裏，毀在災荒裏，毀在自家的悠長的流浪的日子裏……</p>
<p>在褐灰色的記念中，就連那最可慕戀的梅子味與她底草綠色的聲音，也呌人不敢想了。）</p>
<p>和平的家屋在時代的交替中迎着了數不清的風浪，貧困和苦難一次次在衰老了的一代人們底身上襲擊的結果，終於，整個一代的命運跟果樹園裏面的梅樹同樣地倒下來了。帶着一顆幼小的梅子味的心兒給從和平的田園裏推了出來，給擲到生活的海裏，漂着，掙扎着。</p>
<p>可是，自家兒是從平靜的田野，從綺麗的果樹園裏的梅子味中，從樸實的世界中長成的啊；而且，在那裏，我還遺留着幼年的靈魂，與不可磨滅的輕紗一般的笑呢。</p>
<p>一想到大海一般荒茫的生活的路，幼小的靈魂是已經失掉了生活的勇氣了。記得的，也是在一個梅子成熟的五月的夜晚啊，在小市鎮的車展上，她和我說過一句話的：「別把梅子的酸味灌到心裏去啊、生活史需要勇氣的。到一個好的時代來到的時候，也許可以回來看梅子的丰滿了呢。」</p>
<p>是的，苦難的日子是不會沒有盡頭的，「也許」有一個日子會重又看到故鄉的悠閒的天地與果樹園裏的梅子吧？</p>
<p>那麽着，我是始終在過往的追念中帶着梅子味的心情一天天的地活下去，而被當作動人的季節的五月也一次次帶着梅子味在苦難中過去。好的日子已經有無限的遠——也許永遠地背着人流去了。</p>
<h3>初夏的公園裏</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>一　清晨</p>
<p>早上，當太陽還未出來的時候，都市還給一層淡淡的青烟似的朝霞籠罩着，街頭是靜靜的，一陣一陣的清涼的暮春的風吹襲着胸膛，像還帶着殘寒底氣息，給人們感到這時節里的天氣是那麼畸形的。</p>
<p>踏進了公園，這時分，除了叢密的樹梢間給風飄璗得呼呼地哨聲跟小鳥兒像毫不知到人間的淒涼或悲哀的，一種全然是愉快的氣息，吱喳吱喳地吵個不停的，以外，都是清淨的，都市的大部分人還在甜夢中，公園里當人是罩籠着不可擺曉的清涼底布幕呵。</p>
<p>太陽，溫柔的初夏的太陽像正當是少女時代的美麗而害羞的忸怩地微笑着出來的宇宙給穿上了廣大的鮮紅的輕紗也似的衣裳了，太陽光跨上了碧綠的林梢，鳥兒們正在享樂地歌唱着，像祝頌她們的幸福似的。太陽漸漸地從高高的林梢跨到平靜的草場，照射到平靜的湖面。湖邊的巖石上傾瀉下來的白色的泉水沙沙地流到湖里去。湖面也給朝霞的紅色的光彩反照着連那垂倒的楊柳的青影也格外地顯出了美麗來。無數的金魚兒在水面游璗着，滾動了水面一個一個的輕微的波濤的圈子，這兒，早晨的公園里一切都是那麼美麗而可愛的呵。</p>
<p>二　幸福的人們</p>
<p>漸漸兒，公園里已給絡繹不絕的遊人們點綴着，沒有了靜穆的，沒有了鳥兒的歌唱，沒有了那殘寒的氣息——公園里到處地顯露出初夏的氣味兒來了。從太陽變了白色的光芒漸漸兒高掛在天空的時分，一直到太陽又帶着了疲倦似的喘息的西降的氣息的黃昏，公園里便是那麼擾雜的，毫沒有靜穆的詩意底氣味了——眼睛所眺望見的，除了那碧綠的林子間的色素以外，就是一羣一羣穿着春裝的夏裝的，打扮得那麼妖媚的女人們的脂粉的臉孔，青年男子的放浪，老遠的都是這樣的人羣追逐着，是呵！這是帶着深重的青春的氣味的時分呵！青年人都是一樣的給可愛而美麗的影子撩動了心頭呢。</p>
<p>除了一些雙雙的年輕男女的細語，出了一些顯露了時代的渴求的輕璗着的臉孔，除了一些毫不知這時代的慘淡的人們在狂歡似的以外，我們可以看見一羣一羣的小孩子們，穿着美麗的紅綠的衣裳的孩子們在沙灘上玩着，談笑着，在碧色的草場上奔跑着，那種愉快的情調增加了公園里無限的色彩呀，</p>
<p>三　黃昏</p>
<p>太陽真的疲倦了吧，吊在高高的蔚藍色的天空里已過了許久了，現在，她輕輕地又從林梢里隱滅下去了。一種慘淡的紅色的晚霞真和早上的氣息不相同的景色已漸漸地離開人間了。</p>
<p>一羣一羣的人們漸漸兒的離開了公園。到了黑漆的夜色佔有了宇宙的時候，公園里顯出了一種可怕的瞧不清楚地模糊的畫面，廣漠地展開的——詩人該是埋在屋裡的燈光底下寫詩的時候了，都市里的狂歡者該在甜夢里顛倒着了。</p>
<p>然而呵！公園里却像死了似地，看不見青春的一切了。</p>
<h3>夜歸</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>夜，是靜的，天，是靜的，空氣，也是靜的。</p>
<p>禮拜六的夜裏，一個緊嵌在心頭不能忘懷的日子，那是拉着人興奮的時候哪！</p>
<p>在北四川路的標準鐘上，告訴着你已到了三點一刻了，青雲，孕育着將動的胎，爛醉的水兵，哼着淩亂的調子，不是麼？年紅燈怪照眼的，在某一時間，或許會覺得牠的討厭，但，這個時候，這個不能忘懷的禮拜六的夜里裏，牠好像另具有一番力量，往各個人的眼中刺着，什麽酒排間，跳舞場，門口的不同顏色底字，也會格外牽咬着你會經疲倦了的心情。</p>
<p>一過了四川路橋，能不由自主的將你振奮着的心情鬆洩了，在那裏，找不到刺激，接觸的却都是死寂。</p>
<p>時候不停地跑，在惠羅公司的門口，那橫着的馬路像蛇一樣，安翔的臥着，脊背上是黑油油地，在射着懶散的光。</p>
<p>日昇樓，多熟的名字，縱橫的鐵軌交叉着，幾輛焦急的車子不時的追問着：「車子，阿要？」這，對於走慣了的人不免要感到厭煩的。不景氣的氛圍包繞着每個地心，在煎迫下，他不禁的要問，然而，他那能理會，衣冠比較齊楚一些的人，也在遭受着同樣地苦痛呢？也被這苦痛不時的打擊呢？</p>
<p>一個小的篷子，緊靠在鐵軌的旁邊，幾隻紅色的小燈在各別的擺着，火的花投射到蓬的周邊，這偉大的奇景呵！</p>
<p>腿，有點發酸，腳跟，腫了呢！是不人道么？終於，車子拖着我跑了。車夫的腿，那麼有勁，車子在蛇的路上跑着，多清脆吶！當靜的夜間，那音波是很容易躥進了你的耳鼓的。</p>
<p>一個灣，一條路，匆匆地過去了。吻着寒峭的風拐進了富有異國情調的街，挺直，燈，不嫌多，但也並不少，光度剛巧合適，燈的圈子投到光坦的路面，那是很圓的。行人道的樹，吐着碧綠的葉子，受了風的侵襲，淅瀝淅瀝地。</p>
<p>不覺的，眼睛閉上了，身子隨同着車夫的腳步顛簸着，漸漸地，一層混沌湧定心，意識開始的模糊了。</p>
<p>「突」的，車子停了，額角上淌着汗珠，不用說，臉是漲得挺紅，望着我，發出會意的笑。摸摸袋子，多加了幾個銅元，揉了一下眼，自忖着：</p>
<p>—呵，今天的時日又算消磨了。</p>

<h3>宿店之春</h3>
<p>— 克明</p>
<p>雖然說時代是已經用了飛一般的步子走到了二十世紀的尖端了。二十世紀，在繁盛的都會裏，據說是機械的世界，電的世界，與適宜於享樂及便利的世界啊！春天了，在那兒我們能預想得出；玻璃一般平滑的街道上飛奔着好多整齊的流綫化的高速率自働車，裝着機械的小艇在水裏衝馳着像一條綫；二十世紀的都會，連野外的自然物；這靑而又紫的籠罩着一層烟霧的出，這像女孩子的情意一般柔軟的水流，都是受過科學的洗拭的：祇有那兒，才駐留着眞正的現代，眞正的二十世紀的。</p>
<p>眞的呢！要是你也像我們一個樣子：走到僻處在北地的那一些困苦而古老的村子裏去看看：僱一匹瘦弱的驟子，在無窮盡長與荒凉的沙路上顚疲地走上一整天，到太陽偏了西的時分（這時，繁盛的都會中還剛是一個熱鬧的開始呢），為了怕黑路上的士匪與野狠，便不得不趕緊胡亂找一所破敗而古老的宿店安身，且又在夜晚的油盞火下面聽着各種人的陳舊的嘆息與威傷的時候，你一定會忘記了時代的進展之程序，而有着一種中世紀的荒寂的感受的。</p>
<p>在經商的飄流性下面，我們便又一次地相約着做遠地的巡行了。出去的時候，在江南是一個畫一般的春天；有錦繡一般的花，也有花一般的人，但就在這個好的季候，我們便帶着布疋，帶着藥品，帶着美孚燈眾，糖，肥皂，興其他日用的物品，沒着落地飄到這僻遠的北地的小村子裏來了。</p>
<p>已經是如畫的三春了啊！可是在那兒，我們却依舊吹到凜冽的凄絕的風；在一個昏暗的日暮，幾個人坐着　子，緩滯地在匹練一般的沙子的　道上走。那種意象是難以描畫的；而接着，暮色便像電一樣汛速地落下來。當遠處的禿山在蒼茫中變成了鬼一般的黑影的時分，我們已經找到一家打着「仕商客萬」的「包家老店』裏歇了身，而且在全村僅有的幾盞黃得發了紅的美孚洋油燈下面喝着三春的凉酒了。</p>
<p>宿店是在這村子裏再沒有比「包家」的更講究的了：人是聚集在被稱作「客堂」的一個大統間裏，坑牀底下已經沒有了火，因為是春天了啊。是的；天氣一煖，土坑上少了火，但屋子裏却多出了一般難受的霉氣了。那種氣息不斷地燻着人，而人則就會有着一種作噁的不舒適了。兩盞掛在屋角的兩頭的煤油冒出黑黑的烟，而一面則又放出了枯黃的光來照着客人們底上了酒色的臉。人們三三兩兩地聚在燈底下玩紙挖花，嘆老年的苦境，說荒年，談小麥興高粱的收成，講市面上的鳥洋緞子的市價……</p>
<p>含着給燒酒醉麻了的不淸楚的語音，所代表的却全是一些本鄉佬與外路人的不快意啊，咒駡着，感嘆着，爭論着；動了嘴，也動了手，又一個夜間在擾亂中來臨了；人在苦難中是難以安定的，正如北風中的野火。</p>
<p>但是，當半燈的洋油燃盡，燈火由黯淡而熄滅了的時候，人全亂七八精的橫在地上打起呼來了。一陣風從紙窗裏掠過來：北地的三春是帶着霉味的，像腐爛了的中世紀一樣……</p>

<h3>New Security Force: Actively Preparing to Depart; Garrison Locations Designated Separately; Li Yunsheng's Unit Abbreviated; Hebei Provincial Government Dispatches Personnel to Supervise</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tangshan Dispatch: The new security force units of Zhang Yantian, Zhang Qingyu, etc., after receiving orders to depart, are actively preparing. It is estimated that they can enter by the 5th or 6th of this month, and will complete the departure no later than the 10th. Da Mu, a staff officer of the Japanese garrison, is scheduled to go from Tianjin to Tangshan within a few days. Yin Rugeng will also make a trip to Tangshan. The security force unit of Feng Shoupeng will be reorganized into 500 men, including 50 mounted police. After the reorganization, the designation will be changed to the War Zone Security Supplementary Police Corps, still led by Feng as the Corps Commander. The Ping authorities will dispatch personnel to inspect. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The security supplementary team of Li Yunsheng, stationed in Tongxian County, Yanjiao, and Xiadian in the Hebei War Zone, the two battalions of Sun Yuchen and Liu Benzhi, will be abbreviated on the 4th. On the 3rd, the provincial government dispatched Staff Officer Li of the 51st Army, together with Qu Shihe, a counselor from the Ji-Mi Special Commissioner's Office, to supervise. The two units will each be reorganized into one battalion, each battalion with four companies, each company with 120 men. Feng Shoupeng's unit will be abbreviated after the reorganization of Sun and Liu's units and will be under the command of Li Yunsheng. Zhang Qingyu, Commander of the War Zone New Special Police First Corps, and Zhang Yantian, Commander of the Second Corps, left Tianjin on the morning of the 3rd to return to their respective defense areas to prepare for the exchange of defenses to the east. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming said that regarding the command of the security force, no other title will be established. It will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Security Department, which will task the two Special Commissioner's Offices to be responsible. For the convenience of handling affairs, the Special Commissioner's Office will transfer officers and adjutants of each corps to assist in the office for promotion, transfer, and salary matters. The provincial government will dispatch a quartermaster to handle salary matters, register reports, and other items. After the special police move east, the designations of each unit will be reorganized and collectively renamed the Hebei Provincial Security Force, canceling the term "War Zone." Zhang Qingyu, Zhang Yantian, Zhou Yuying, Zhao Lei, and Liu Zuozhou will be referred to as the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Corps in sequence. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The security force of Li Yunsheng, stationed in XiaDian Yanjiao, will be reorganized immediately. The provincial government has dispatched Section Chief Li, and the Ji-Mi District Office has dispatched Secretary Qu Shihe, to go to supervise tomorrow. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhu Shidong came to Tianjin from Ping in the afternoon of the 3rd to meet with Tao Shangming. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming told reporters on the 3rd that the newly formed security force is confirmed to gradually enter the war zone starting from the 10th. The designations will be uniformly changed to "Hebei Provincial Security [Number] Corps" in order to standardize. In addition, several assistants will be specially established within the Special Commissioner's Office to provide consultation and handle salary matters for the security force. These personnel may be appointed by the provincial government. The first step of work after entering the war zone will be to carry out road construction. The war zone is currently very peaceful, but the gambling houses along the railway line are very rampant, and it has been decided to find ways to eliminate them. (3rd Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The first and second corps commanders of the Xinlun War Zone Security Force, Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian, etc., came to Tianjin a few days ago to receive instructions. Now that their official business is completed, they are scheduled to return to their defense areas on the 5th to prepare for departure. The required vehicles have been fully negotiated with the railway bureau. (3rd Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The war zone security force rotation issue has been finalized after final consultations with relevant parties. It has been decided to start mobilizing from the 10th. Regarding the garrison locations, except for the units of Zhao Lei and Liu Zuozhou, which will remain unchanged, the corps headquarters of Zhang Qingyu will be located in Jixian County for command convenience, with the following two detachments, one located in Jixian County and one in Shunyi. Zhang Yantian's corps headquarters will be located in Liushouying, with the following two detachments, one located in Funing and one in Lulong. As for Zhou Yuying's unit, it will be concentrated in Yutian, Zunhua, and other places to carry out bandit suppression. (3rd Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The first and second battalions of the old security force stationed in Yanjiao and Xiadian, Yutian, after being ordered to be abbreviated, are now being supervised by personnel dispatched by the Hebei Provincial Government together with Qu Shihe, secretary of the Ji-Mi District Special Commissioner's Office, to handle the matter on the 4th. A total of 750 men will be compiled. Each remaining police officer in the unit will be given ten yuan and sent back to their hometowns. It is estimated that it can be completed within a week. It was originally planned to proceed at the same time with Feng Shoupeng's unit in Tangshan, but it has now been decided to proceed after the first and second battalions are compiled. (3rd Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rehe Opium: Transported and Sold to Various Parts of the War Zone</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tangshan Dispatch: Since the Japanese encouraged the cultivation of opium in the entire province of Rehe, there has been an oversupply of opium. Consequently, opium merchants have secretly transported it to various parts of the North China War Zone. At the passes of the Great Wall, a certain party has set up a bureau specifically for shipping opium. The opium transported to various parts of the war zone is sold for only two dimes per tael, while the opium transported to various parts of North China is sold for three dimes per tael. In April, the Rehe opium transported to the war zone totaled 10 million taels. It is estimated that 3 million taels of opium planted in the entire province of Rehe will be harvested before the Dragon Boat Festival this year. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) 75% of the land in the pseudo-Rehe territory is planted with opium. The officially determined price is at least $1.20 per tael and $2.50 at most. Due to overproduction, Japanese and Korean vagrants have set up transit agencies to transport it into our territory through the passes of the Great Wall, charging 20 to 30 cents per tael, resulting in opium sales throughout the war zone, reaching every place. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Various Counties in Luandong: Anti-Smuggling Teams Established</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Luandong Fengrun, Leting, Changli, Funing county governments have established anti-smuggling teams, responsible for investigating and patrolling private exports of silver. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Private smuggling of silver out of the pass in Luandong has gradually decreased. Private smuggling has disappeared elsewhere in recent days. The Japanese authorities in Yuguan are also assisting in inspections. The five counties of Funing, Fengrun, and Leting have each submitted a request to the Hebei Provincial Government to organize anti-smuggling teams. Regarding the inspection issue on the Ping-Shen through train, after negotiations between our customs officials and the Japanese side, the Japanese have agreed to implement it and will send personnel to assist.

<h3>A Glimmer of Hope in the Declining Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Silk sales, since the overseas market was seized, are now merely sustained by domestic users. However, in recent years, although the price of silk has been falling, sales are still not as good as before. As a result, silk businesses, whether weaving or trading, are all at risk of losses. It is heard that the market has become even worse since this year. The reason is that, no matter how cheap the selling price is, business is still difficult to improve. This is because the general economic hardship is becoming increasingly acute. No matter how beautiful the goods are, no matter how cheap the price is, it is useless because people cannot afford to buy them. Cheapness is also useless. This price decline is due to a reduction in demand. The situation of cheap prices due to reduced demand is very different from that of cheap prices due to overproduction. Therefore, it is feared that the silk industry will not improve easily, and the silk market will not recover in a short period of time. Since it is not a short-term matter, should we let it decline without taking any measures to save it? That is not the case either. China's greatest economic difficulty today lies in non-production. If there is no production, there is no source of income, and the way out is blocked. Silk is ultimately a productive industry. How can we not raise silkworms because the price of silk is low? If this is the case, there is no way to produce, and how can the market have any hope of improving? Therefore, today's question is, what is the policy for this year's cocoon harvest? What are the measures for silk reeling after the cocoon harvest? For farmers, they should not stop raising silkworms because the price of cocoons is low. Although the price of cocoons is low, there is still income after all, which is better than non-production. For cocoon merchants, in the past, there was no lack of suppressing silkworm farmers when collecting cocoons, hoping to obtain extraordinary profits. Or they did not distinguish between good and bad quality, which led to the destruction of the heart of improving the quality of cocoons. Or there was competition among peers, raising prices to buy, which caused the failure in the future. All of these are not correct. Cocoon merchants themselves should also bear considerable responsibility for the degradation of cocoon quality and the failure of the past cocoon industry. The silk reeling industry should start from refreshing technology and improving production equipment. This is difficult, but without doing so, it will not be possible to compete in the overseas market, and recovery will be even more difficult. The habit of waiting for prices to estimate, ignoring the situation, and only considering self-interest also needs to be reformed. The silk industry has been renovating and innovating in recent years, competing for novelty and beauty, which is enough to move people's eyes and prevent the intrusion of foreign goods. However, precisely because of this, in the autumn of economic tightening and depression of all industries, the market is not enough to cope with frequent renovations. Inventory is easy to be left on the shelves, and turnover loses its agility. Losses then follow. Therefore, it seems that the silk industry should seek its own control, both for production and sales. If it can be consistent in valuing quality over quantity and agreeing not to endorse foreign goods, it will be a way to save itself and the silk cocoon industry. Today, if we want to reduce the number of import excesses, in addition to actively promoting exports, we must seek self-use in self-produced goods and not rely on external demand. In this way, foreign goods will have no way to be imported. Therefore, while maintaining the silk industry, the silk industry strives to strengthen itself, examines past mistakes, and tries to improve from all aspects to meet the needs of the Chinese people. This is the best way to produce and use for oneself.</p>
<h3>German Air Minister Göring's Speech</h3>
<p>The German Air Force Should be Equal to France's, Denies Violating International Treaties</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Air Minister General Göring, when speaking today about Germany's air defense and its wishes, firmly denied that Germany intended to violate international treaties, saying that Germany's air defense is equal to that of any country in the world, and its defense power should be as strong as the combined offensive power of other countries. Germany's special need is that its air force should be equal to the French air force. If there are international treaties that include all countries, then Germany will definitely abide by them and reduce its air force. Since Germany's rearmament, Germany has taken several concrete actions for peace. Judging from Göring's remarks regarding the wishes of the German air force, his meaning seems to be that if the European powers, excluding Germany, have a joint defense organization, then Germany will demand to have an air force as strong as the combined air forces of other countries. However, the signing of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact cannot be interpreted as Germany needing an air force equal in strength to the combined forces of France and Russia, because Russia should not be considered a European country.

<h3>Communication Cut Off in Manila, Communist Uprising in the Philippines, Hundreds Killed and Injured in Midnight Uprising, Military and Police Suppress the Riot and Gradually Restore Order</h3>
<p>(Manila) The Communist Party of the Philippines suddenly launched an uprising in various areas near Manila last night. After military and police suppression, the riot gradually subsided this morning. At dawn today, Manila dispatched reinforcements to the riot locations. Most of the rebels have now been routed. Manila residents were initially very frightened upon hearing the news of the Communist Party attacking the capital. After learning that communication between the capital and the provinces had been cut off and that Manila was isolated, they became even more anxious. The troops immediately went on the defensive to prevent further unrest. The number of dead and wounded is now known to be as follows: Laguna Province, 54 dead, 64 wounded; Cavite, number of dead unknown, 3 wounded; Bulacan, 3 dead, 12 wounded. The highest number of casualties occurred in Cabuyao, where 47 rebels were killed, 55 wounded, and many arrested. Military and police casualties were very light, with only 1 killed and 10 wounded. Rumors in Washington suggested that Japan provided financial assistance to the Communist uprising. The Japanese Consul in Manila today firmly denied this, saying that nothing could be more absurd. The Chinese Consul is extremely concerned about this riot. Vice Consul Mr. Mo inquired with the police department this afternoon and said that there were rumors that the communists were planning to rob Chinese shops. The authorities assured him that security was tight and that the Chinese in Manila need not be alarmed. The news of the Communist uprising reached here at 8:30 last night. Shortly after, communications were cut off. The authorities immediately dispatched military and police to various locations. In the early morning, the military and police arrived in Cabuyao and launched an attack on the Communist Party's concentration point. The rebels resisted stubbornly, not only refusing to surrender but also opening fire. The military and police then launched a forceful assault on the church occupied by the rebels. After a fierce battle lasting over an hour, 47 rebels were killed and the rest scattered. One wounded rebel claimed that he had been persuaded to join the demonstration and never expected it to turn into a battle. Another captured rebel said that he heard that the Communist leader, Ramos, had returned from Japan by plane. Many of the captured rebels carried amulets, believing that these amulets could protect their bodies from harm. The Communist Party is quite popular among workers. Due to the recent economic recession and the hardships faced by workers, many have joined the Communist Party. This riot was clearly planned in advance, taking advantage of the fact that the acting governor was not in Manila, launching attacks in various locations. This afternoon, government officials stated that the riot in Cabuyao had failed and that the unrest in other areas could be considered pacified. The Manila military authorities are prepared to dispatch troops at any time. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>US Senator Hopes the Disturbance Will Pass Quickly</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Republican Senator Gibson stated that he had received hints of serious disturbances brewing in the Philippines a week ago. Mr. Gibson said, "I hope the current disturbance will pass quickly, and the Filipinos should know that in these turbulent times in the East, they need the assistance of a powerful nation." In Washington, Philippine Resident Commissioner de Guia, upon receiving news of the uprising, explained that the disturbance may only be an outbreak by a few misguided Filipinos, or the result of incitement by cunning individuals exploiting the public. Governor General Murphy and Senate President Quezon both believe that this disturbance does not represent the true sentiment of the Filipino people. Democrat Kim William said that this rebellion may be the work of a few radicals. The majority of Filipinos are law-abiding and will not participate in such demonstrations. At most, some people are disappointed by the delayed approval of independence, which is understandable, but most Filipinos can approach this matter with good spirit. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>US Sailors Ordered to Defend the Navy Yard</h3>
<p>Manila - Santa Rosa, Luzon, became a battlefield today.

US sailors have been ordered to defend the Cavite Navy Yard. The city hall of San Ildefonso, Bulacan, was also occupied by rebels. The police were surrounded for several hours. After a fierce battle, the police finally defeated the rebels, killing six of them. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Riot, All Leaders Wanted</h3>
<p>Manila - Today, over ten villages and cities near Manila were devastated by a brutal riot by radical farmers. According to information received this afternoon, approximately fifty to sixty people have died, and over fifty have been injured. The swift action of the police preserved the Philippine capital from being affected by the "Sakdalistas." Telephone and telegraph lines within a ten-to-fifteen-mile radius of Manila have been cut, making communication with the disturbed areas impossible. Among the dead, at least one was a local official who was killed when a group of police officers were ambushed and shot. It is reported that fully armed rebels came from the provinces of Laguna, Rizal, Bulacan, and Cavite. The Philippine newspaper The Tribune reported that a police team of over one hundred attacked the rebels in Cabuyao, killing approximately sixty and wounding over forty. Later, the official wireless report received by the Police Headquarters, issued by Colonel Nick Taulto, stated that Cabuyao had been recaptured, with forty-seven rebels killed and countless captured. The assault on Calamba is ongoing, but there is a great need for ammunition and rifle bullets. The earliest news of the riot received by the police station came from the underworld at eight o'clock last night. The news stated that the rioters planned to attack Manila at midnight. Troops rushed to the affected areas to suppress the riotous farmers and agitators. The garrison in Santa Rosa, Laguna, was ambushed and fought hand-to-hand with the rebels. An officer was killed, and six were injured. Two "Sakdalistas" were killed, and two children were injured. At least four rebels were captured. The next riot occurred in San Ildefonso, Bulacan, where rebels forcibly occupied the municipal government building. Riots also occurred in other towns such as San Jose, Daniel Monte, Binangonan, Dasmariñas, Tanza, Bacoor, Silang, Santa Rosa, and Biñan. An order has been issued for the arrest of Marino Enage, the representative of Laguna province in the Philippine legislature, who was elected in 1934 as the leader of the "Sakdalista" party, but it is rumored that he later left the party. Other leaders are also wanted in order to investigate the riot. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>The Cause of the Rebellion Seems to be Opposition to the Constitution</h3>
<p>(New York) News from the Philippines received here today states that the rebellion near Manila was likely caused by opponents of the Philippine Constitution. Philippine Senate President Quezon, currently in New York, stated this afternoon that telegraph and telephone communication between Manila and the provinces had been cut off. According to a Manila newspaper, demonstrations occurred in five provinces. The Philippine Constitution, approved by President Roosevelt on March 23, stipulates a Philippine republican system, recognizes American sovereignty, and requires officials to swear allegiance to the United States upon the establishment of the republic on December 30. The Philippine Congress is scheduled to vote on it on May 11. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Danzig City Government has devalued the Gulden by forty-two percent. The general interpretation is that this should have happened long ago. Only with the assistance of the German Central Bank was the Bank of Danzig able to temporarily overcome the difficulties. However, the Central Bank is now unable to continue its assistance. In general, German assistance was only enough to delay the devaluation until after the Free City Council elections, so that the Nazi Party's election campaign would not be affected. The main reasons for the devaluation are as follows: (1) The Nazi City Government's efforts to prevent unemployment have led to a gradual decrease in the gold reserves and cash of the Danzig Bank. In 1933, the gold reserves amounted to 40,000,000 Gulden, which decreased to 21,000,000 Gulden in March of this year. On the other hand, the amount of bills payable also increased from 14,000,000 to 24,000,000 Gulden. (2) The maritime transport business of the Polish port of Gdynia is becoming increasingly developed, resulting in fierce competition with the port of Danzig. In addition, the advance capital for transit trade also poses a great difficulty to the cash situation. The Free City's foreign claims are mostly long-term, and therefore affected by the devaluation of the currencies of many countries, but its foreign debts are mostly short-term. Therefore, the City Government was able to勉力维持戈爾盾之匯率以至今日者,賴有德國之資助耳 maintain the exchange rate of the Gulden until today, thanks to German funding. This morning, the City Government issued a bulletin, denouncing the public's credit panic, saying that it was a political strategy of the opposition party, and tantamount to rebellious behavior. Now that the exchange rate of the Gulden has fallen to half that of the Mark, the economic relations between the Free City and Germany have been hindered by the devaluation. Conversely, the exchange rate of the Gulden is roughly equivalent to the Polish currency Zloty, and the economic relations between the two sides should become closer as a result. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Crowded Shops</h3>
<p>Warsaw - After the Senate of the Free City of Danzig decided to reduce the value of the Danzig currency, the Gulden, by forty-two percent, residents of the Free City rushed to various shops with banknotes to purchase goods. The shops were extremely crowded. As a result, some shops temporarily closed, while others limited the quantity of goods sold. This afternoon, the Danzig City Council held a meeting, attended by Senate President Greiser, who explained that the Senate's sudden decision to devalue the currency was intended to avoid speculation. The purpose of the devaluation is to reduce imports and increase exports. Because Danzig is restricted by the Treaty of Versailles, which deprives it of its natural market, it is now forced to devalue the currency in order to revive Danzig's trade. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Brazil Agrees to Participate in the Mediation of the Gran Chaco Dispute</h3>
<p>Brazilian Capital - Recently, the United States, Argentina, Chile, and Peru jointly invited Brazil to participate in the mediation of the Gran Chaco dispute. The governments of Great Britain, France, and Italy also strongly urged Brazil to accept this invitation. It is now known that the Brazilian government has accepted this invitation and has notified the British, French, and Italian ambassadors to Brazil, expressing its hope to unite collective forces to guarantee lasting peace on the American continent and to ensure that the conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay is resolved fairly.

<h3>British House of Commons Debates Foreign Policy: MacDonald Delivers Manifesto, Advocating Cooperation with Germany to Maintain European Peace; Britain Unwilling to Participate in Central European Rome Conference</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the House of Commons debated foreign policy. The diplomatic gallery and the public gallery were full. Prime Minister MacDonald delivered a manifesto, strongly advocating cooperation with Germany to maintain peace and limit armaments, especially in the air. Foreign Secretary Simon also made a similar appeal, urging Germany to show its willingness to participate in peace efforts, not only in words but also in deeds. Commerce Secretary Runciman announced that in 1934, Britain had shipped 96 aircraft engines manufactured in Britain to Germany, which attracted much attention. Opposition Labour Party leader Lansbury expressed extreme disappointment with the Prime Minister's manifesto. This is the general outline of today's debate. Prime Minister MacDonald stated that Britain's foreign policy combines defense, collective security, international armaments, and peace treaties. Its purpose is not military alliances but the broadest possible cooperation. Currently, attention is focused on a good understanding between Britain and</p>
<p>A Guarantee of Peace, and we welcome other countries to join this free alliance. The future contains opportunities for easing tensions but also contains perceptible dangers. I say this with great conviction and because I deeply understand the crux of the matter. Britain is always mindful of assisting opportunities for agreements arising from negotiations without disturbing the peace of Europe or the world. The Prime Minister then recounted the events since February 3rd, referring to the joint Anglo-French declaration issued that day, stating that one of the purposes of the planned negotiations was to conclude a free-negotiation armament treaty with Germany and other countries, replacing the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. If this had succeeded earlier, the current danger in Europe would have been more than halved. The London Declaration clearly indicated that Britain and France would break away from the confines of Versailles and establish friendly relations in Europe based on security and</p>
<p>Free Negotiation. On February 3rd, the British and French governments began patiently working to restore goodwill in Europe. Other governments felt that the future was gradually becoming brighter. Before long, Germany accepted the London Declaration as a basis for discussion. Consequently, their hopes were further consolidated. Then, the German government suddenly announced its intention to implement compulsory military service and immediately began increasing its peacetime military strength to 150,000 men and establishing an air force. This is truly regrettable. Historians must study the trends of events, while politicians have no choice but to deal with the real situation practically and objectively and maintain calm common sense. Should they abandon the attempt to build general trust and European peace or rely on the unity of full military power that can never save them from war? Politicians must now choose one of the two. When considering the future, they should know that Hitler has said that while he is determined not to sign treaties he considers unenforceable, he is also determined not to make</p>
<p>Attempts at Destruction. Hitler also publicly announced Germany's readiness and determination to accept the spirit and letter of the Locarno Treaty. This must also be noted. The declaration of February 3rd was satisfying to all of Europe because this document could be the starting point for a stable solution in Europe. The Stresa Conference did not change the substance of that declaration. The communiqué issued at the end of the Stresa Conference fully confirmed the points contained in the London communiqué. This kind of earnest statement is extremely important. The London Declaration contained suggestions for ending certain anxieties in Central and Eastern Europe. Britain is not directly affected by this suggestion but will pay attention to it or any changes to it, in the hope of providing beneficial and friendly advice at any time and obtaining the hoped-for results. Therefore, negotiations should be conducted with the concept of producing truly effective results. Regarding Central Europe, the Italian government proposed convening a meeting of the relevant governments in Rome, including Germany, to discuss a plan. The British government does not wish to send a delegation to participate in this meeting because the British government has stated that it does not wish to accept any new responsibilities regarding this matter. However, it will send personnel to</p>
<p>Attend as Observers in order to closely monitor the progress of the discussions and make beneficial and appropriate contributions. As for Central Europe, Germany can make valuable contributions to the security system in that region. When British Foreign Secretary Simon visited Berlin, the German leader announced that in principle, he was willing to negotiate multilateral non-aggression pacts with the countries of Eastern Europe. While countries hope that Germany is prepared to join a broader treaty, Hitler's proposal should not be allowed to fade away. Countries are convinced that Germany itself will immediately take concrete steps to advance the principles set by its leader. Why cannot this kind of non-aggression pact be compatible with the mutual guarantee pact that France and other governments have not yet negotiated? I believe the two agreements can complement each other and move towards creating a complete system of collective security in Eastern Europe. What I now wish to state is that, as far as the British government is concerned, we have never believed that the security system proposed in the London Declaration can be completed without Germany's participation. When the Stresa Conference studied the entire declaration, the policy adopted by the British government representative was to maintain the possibility of this kind of cooperation. All activities embody the principle of collective security, but the methods may occasionally differ. The general attitude of the British government is to advocate discussing the issue with a spirit of flexibility and freedom, in order to achieve this principle as much as possible and effectively</p>
<p>Deter Aggression. We are striving to build an instrument of cooperation and goodwill, and when Germany also makes a corresponding contribution, Berlin's sudden unilateral declaration regarding the army, air force, and navy will inevitably profoundly disturb the peace in the minds of all of Europe. This is an undeniable fact. The British government is always attentive to the various beneficial constructions proposed in Berlin and elsewhere. However, they should know that the concept of mutual trust must first be restored before detailed international negotiations can achieve full effectiveness. The instructions we brought to the Stresa Conference were not to reject any country from participating in future negotiations along the lines set out in the London Declaration due to previous incidents. The Stresa Conference did not invalidate any point of that declaration. We deeply regret the changes that have occurred in the situation, but the main purpose of that declaration remains the current goal of British foreign policy. If the trust that now exists between France, Italy, and Britain is once weakened or extinguished, the consequences will be unimaginable. We should be extremely careful to avoid this. Our goal is to increase the number of cooperating countries and try in every way to prevent them from dividing into several groups and confronting each other. Will Germany now not return and prove its willingness to help restore the international trust that its recent independent actions regarding armaments have damaged? The British government deeply feels that</p>
<p>International Cooperation is the only foundation on which world peace can be built. The Prime Minister then mentioned the preliminary discussions on naval affairs that will be held with German representatives in London, saying that it is truly appalling that Germany suddenly announced its shipbuilding program at this time, with submarines also included. This matter cannot be regarded as unrelated to Britain. The needs of the British Navy cannot be determined solely by domestic waters. The British Navy has extraordinary responsibilities of a global nature. I do not wish to downplay the seriousness of Germany's decision to build submarines, but the British government is still prepared to receive German representatives to open preliminary naval talks. These talks will proceed under the same conditions as the talks with the United States and Japan. Regarding the British Air Force, Lord President of the Council Baldwin has previously stated that Britain will never allow its air force to be inferior to Germany's, no matter what. The expansion of the German air force has</p>
<p>Continued on Page 7</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>The extent has far exceeded the number previously estimated by the British House of Commons. The British government is now working to continue accelerating the expansion of the air force within this year to fulfill Baldwin's declaration. Regarding the Sky Pact, we are determined not to be swayed by the idea of an aggressive military alliance. We are currently seeking to conclude a defensive unity against attacks with various countries, including Germany, to protect civilians. Labour Party, i.e., Opposition Leader Lansbury, then rose to express</p>
<p>Extreme Disappointment because it excessively involves the increase of armaments and takes this as the initial stage of seeking other conditions for peace. At the same time, he also said that Germany's actions to rearm and the attitude it took when negotiations were about to begin are unforgivable. Labour Party members believe that Hitler's attitude has lost much sympathy. Samuel, the leader of the Liberal Party, then rose to declare that Germany's military policy is not to seek equality with other countries but to surpass them. Germany's naval proposal is untimely. Germany is also building a huge air force at an extremely rapid rate. Germany should know that if it pursues this policy without seeking a compromise on arms limitation, it will arouse public anger in all parts of Britain. If the Liberal Party studies the government's detailed proposals and knows that the British Air Force is indeed inferior to Germany's, then the Liberal Party is unwilling to bear the responsibility of allowing Britain to be in this state and will support the urgently needed plan. The next speaker was Churchill, who expressed his approval of the government's recent policies, but said that the government should have taken this action earlier. The government has been negligent in its awareness of Germany's air force armaments and has received false intelligence. The number of military aircraft currently being built in Germany is</p>
<p>Ten Times that of Britain. By the end of this year, the German Air Force will be at least three or four times stronger than Britain's. If Germany is the only country that needs to be dealt with, then Britain should let it do as it pleases. However, Britain, acting in concert with France, Italy, and other countries that earnestly wish to maintain peace, has the power to maintain tranquility and freedom. When countries are willing to work under the authority of the League of Nations, he does not wish to reject the cooperation of any country's government that meets this test. This has not closed the door to treaty revisions but is a plan to lay the foundation for tranquility and security. Now, tranquility and security must be established first, and then this kind of treaty revision study can begin. After Churchill finished speaking, former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain rose to comment on Germany's attitude, saying that if Germany refuses to attend when invited by other countries, then it cannot complain about being surrounded. If Germany has the spirit of cooperation and the will for peace, it will certainly be welcomed. However, if Germany does not wish to join the ranks of nations and insists on pursuing its ambitions, then it will see Britain standing in its path. (The audience cheered.) When Germany, with its vast freedom and autonomous regions, encounters Britain, comprising its four countries, it will see that the power of one country will once again surpass it. Foreign Secretary Simon then spoke to conclude the debate, saying that the British government's armaments memorandum had stipulated a plan aimed at achieving the complete abolition of naval and military aircraft. The speed at which Germany manufactures aircraft is indeed far beyond what British officers had thought. Therefore, the estimates submitted to the House of Commons in October and January of last year are not reliable. Hitler had declared to him that Germany was already equal to Britain, meaning that Germany's first-line strength was equal to Britain's first-line strength. Including overseas forces, Britain's first line has approximately 800 aircraft. Throughout the discussions in Berlin, Hitler expressed Germany's attitude sincerely and thoroughly. He strongly advocated that Germany should return to the League of Nations. However, Hitler's attitude had many disappointing aspects. Simon then mentioned Hitler's objections, saying that Hitler had argued that Japan had already withdrawn from the League of Nations and should not continue to administer the former German colonies as a mandate. He then told him that the issue of allocating mandated territories was not a matter for individual member states alone but should be handled by the League of Nations. At this point, Austen Chamberlain rose to speak in opposition, saying that the countries had never intended that the League of Nations had the power to transfer mandated territories from one country to another. Simon replied that he did not believe he had conveyed a misleading impression. Eden and he had clearly stated that the issue of transferring mandated territories could not be discussed. Hitler should not have misunderstood this. Now, in a spirit of friendship, he had reminded Germany that it had signed the five-nation declaration of equality in the security system and asked whether it was "prepared to restore the security that its recent actions had severely damaged." Simon concluded by saying, "We now urge Germany to show not only in words but also in deeds that it is prepared to do this." The debate was then adjourned. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister MacDonald announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the government would accelerate the expansion of the air force, the newspapers all welcomed it this morning. The newspapers mostly focused on the effect of the consensus among the parties on accepting the government's new air force policy. The five-year program to expand the air force, which was set in July of last year, will be implemented as soon as possible. Subsequently, expansions will be continued as necessary, depending on the situation of the German Air Force. Members of the House of Commons who are concerned about the air force issue estimate that Britain still needs to add 312 aircraft to match the strength of the German Air Force. In addition to the 20 million pounds required for the five-year program, an additional 13 million pounds will be needed. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister and Russian Ambassador Initial Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact; Full Text in Five Articles Published Last Night; Czech-Soviet Union to Conclude Similar Agreement; Moscow Celebrates Diplomatic Victory</h3>
<p>(Paris) Negotiations on the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact have been completed. The pact was initialed at 6:00 PM today by Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin. The pact consists of five articles (the text of which was published by Le Petit Parisien, see yesterday's telegram) and one protocol. In accordance with Articles 10, 15, 16, and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant, if there is a risk of aggression, the two contracting parties, France and the Soviet Union, have an obligation to consult each other. If, without provocation, they are subjected to aggression, then the two countries should immediately implement mutual assistance. The full text of the pact will be published tomorrow night. After signing, Laval issued a declaration, saying, "What we never forget is to participate in the security organization. We adhere to the scope of the League of Nations Covenant. From the beginning of negotiations until now, we ensure that all countries have the opportunity to join. In a word, we are working for peace only." At the same time, Potemkin declared, "This pact not only makes the relationship between France and the Soviet Union more solid but also has more important significance, because it is of great benefit to European security. However, it goes without saying that the mutual assistance pact is not targeted at any country. The Soviet Union has always believed that the obligations contained in the pact can be extended and should be extended so that other countries that sincerely love peace can join." Laval is now scheduled to depart for Russia on the ninth of this month for a visit. He will stop in Warsaw en route to hold talks with the Polish authorities. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement was signed today by French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin at the Foreign Ministry. A communiqué was issued stating that the agreement has five articles, based on Articles 10, 15, and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, stipulating mutual assistance in the event of unprovoked aggression. The purpose of this agreement is to confirm the articles of the League of Nations Covenant and the effectiveness of the recommendations of the League of Nations Council. This responsibility is in maintaining European peace and is fully consistent with the responsibilities previously undertaken by the two countries. It also does not diminish the possibility of either the French or Soviet governments participating in regional agreements with mutual consent, as the conclusion of regional agreements is still necessary. Laval and Potemkin each made speeches, both saying that this agreement is part of the European security organization and is not directed against any country. According to Reuters Geneva, the signing of this agreement is welcomed by all those involved with the League of Nations because this agreement, within the framework of the League of Nations Covenant, is sufficient to consolidate the collective security system. People in Geneva expect that the Czech government will immediately conclude a similar agreement with Soviet Russia. It is also expected that Italy and Soviet Russia will initiate similar negotiations. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Dancing in the Streets, National Acclaim</p>
<p>(Moscow) The news of the signing of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement was greeted with great joy here. It is regarded as the most important success of Soviet Russia in international diplomacy. The public gathered in teams to parade in celebration and danced in the streets. This was first seen after the 1917 revolution. Moscow lit up with lights to celebrate. Around the portraits of Stalin and other important figures, there were thousands of electric lights, forming congratulatory messages to celebrate the victory of Soviet Russian diplomacy. The whole country is very satisfied with the current position of Soviet Russia. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Italy and Poland Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>(Rome) The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact was initialed last night. Here, the pact is considered to be compatible with Central European security and not contradictory to it. Great satisfaction is expressed. In addition, the Polish government has already decided to participate in the Danube Nine-Nation Conference to be held next month. The Italian side is also very relieved because Italy had some concerns about Poland's closeness to Germany, which can now be dispelled. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact has been initialed in Paris but has not yet been published. Generally, people here express satisfaction because what Poland feared was that this pact would have a mechanical application and put Poland out of consideration. On the contrary, since this pact does not endanger the Franco-Polish alliance nor hinder the Russo-Polish non-aggression pact, Poland has no reason for its doubts. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Western Border Security Not Impaired</p>
<p>(Berlin) A certain important person in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a declaration regarding the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, saying, "The obligations contained in the Locarno Pact are not affected." It was also said that the mutual assistance pact does not impair the security of Germany's western border, and the French government's respect for other international obligations is indeed the truth.

<h3>World Silver Prices Plunge; U.S. Senators Criticize, Demanding Treasury Immediately Purchase Silver to Break Bear Speculators Depressing Market Prices</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas, due to the sharp drop in world silver prices, stated in Congress today that the Treasury Department had failed to fulfill the clauses of the Silver Purchase Act, causing the silver price to fall. Other silver-supporting senators also demanded that the Treasury immediately purchase silver. Senator McCarran said that the response to the low silver price should be for the Treasury to immediately raise the silver price to $1.29 and break the bear speculators depressing market prices. Senator Adams stated that although the Treasury had to temporarily suspend silver purchases at times of market instability to prevent speculators from creating bizarre prices, the situation has now cleared up. Market fluctuations were long expected. Today's price drop is not enough to alarm people. The government not only has a reason to purchase silver, but it also has a responsibility to purchase silver now. Senator Wheeler said that the Treasury should now proceed to maintain the upward trend of silver prices. Senator King pointed out that the low silver price was due to speculation, saying that the Treasury wanted to proceed gradually, but the result was to create a situation in which speculators raised prices too quickly to seek their own profits.

<h3>U.S. Chamber of Commerce Convention Criticizes Control Policies; Demands Economic Recovery Regulations Be Adopted Voluntarily by Each Industry</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently consulted with the Senate and the House of Representatives to pass a banking law to subject the Federal Reserve Bank and the entire banking organization to government control. Recently, the National Chamber of Commerce Convention passed a resolution criticizing this policy. The convention also demanded that economic recovery regulations be adopted voluntarily by each industry and not imposed. In addition, in December of last year, the House of Representatives passed the bill introduced by Representative (blank) Gagner, which stipulates that labor-management disputes should be resolved by compulsory arbitration. On the 19th of last month, the House also passed the unemployment and old-age insurance bill. All of these were attacked by the convention. Secretary of State Hull, on the other hand, defended the government's current policies, saying that those who create difficulties for the government out of concern for private interests are unwelcome.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Convenes Meeting of Local Governors; Opened Yesterday at the Prime Minister's Residence; Hirota Strongly Advocates Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today was the first day of the meeting of local governors. It was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 9:00 AM. At the outset, Prime Minister Okada gave instructions, the gist of which was: It is my desire to gather with all of you and express my beliefs, state the government's policies, and clarify the path of public service. In this autumn of many events and many difficulties, the sincerity of dedicating oneself to the Imperial Throne and serving the people is the essence of our national polity and the foundation of our nation-building. I deeply hope that everyone will base themselves on this great righteousness and make no mistakes. The government is preparing to establish the Cabinet Deliberation Council and the Investigation Bureau to meet the demands of the times. I believe that this can overcome the drawbacks of being limited to partial views and determine an appropriate direction from the overall situation of political consultation. The Empire's position in the world will be further enhanced from this, which is very gratifying. The government will work harder to promote friendly relations with other countries and practice good faith and neighborliness. The current situation and prospects of rural villages, fishing villages, small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises are not optimistic, so I hope that we will uphold the fundamental meaning of national renewal and work even harder. The date of the election for prefectural and county council members is also approaching. I hope that everyone will work hard to realize the rectification of discipline. Then, Foreign Minister Hirota, Finance Minister Takahashi, and Justice Minister Ohara each instructed on the beliefs and policies of the current cabinet. At noon, they entered the palace to meet with the Emperor, who bestowed upon them the honor of dining with him. At 4:00 PM, they received instructions from Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa at the Ministry of the Imperial Household. At 6:00 PM, they attended a dinner party at the Prime Minister's residence. (Dentsu, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The National Conference of Local Governors opened at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd at the Prime Minister's residence. Prime Minister Okada, Finance Minister Takahashi, Foreign Minister Hirota, Justice Minister Ohara, and others delivered instructions. Among them, the contents of Foreign Minister Hirota's instructions were roughly as follows: Now, Sino-Japanese relations are gradually improving. I believe that it is the duty of both countries, China and Japan, which bear major responsibilities in the Far East, to implement cooperation and increase friendly relations. It is not only the duty of the officials of both countries but also the mission of the general public of both countries. The development of trade between China and Japan is the cause of enrichment for both countries. I sincerely hope that the private sector and the government will cooperate and actively implement the work of Sino-Japanese cooperation. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Proposes Establishment of Sino-Japanese Chamber of Commerce Council; Organized by Industrialists from Both Countries; Established Separately in Shanghai and Osaka</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In light of the report from Ambassador to China Ariyoshi and the recent progress in Sino-Japanese relations, Foreign Minister Hirota increasingly believes that Sino-Japanese cooperation must start with economic cooperation. After Ambassador Ariyoshi returns to his post, he will immediately begin actively promoting Sino-Chinese economic cooperation. As for the concrete strategies, he is considering various methods, such as setting up a loan credit system, establishing joint ventures, and providing technical assistance. However, in order to implement these strategies, sufficient understanding must first be carried out between Sino-Japanese industrialists. It has now been internally determined that the first step is to advise Sino-Japanese industrialists to set up a Sino-Japanese Chamber of Commerce Council. This council will be modeled after the organizations of the Anglo-Japanese and Japan-U.S. councils and will be organized by committees from both countries in Osaka and Shanghai. After the council is established, it will naturally aim to maintain close contact between the two sides, maintain Sino-Japanese trade relations, and promote friendly relations. (Dentsu, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, Chinese merchants' trade with Japan has gradually improved. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the Chinese authorities have the intention of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and that the time has come to promote economic relations between the two countries. He has decided to change the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' traditional trade and economic policy and plans to organize an economic committee by Sino-Japanese business circles to actively promote the development of the economies of the two countries. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota's plan to organize the Sino-Japanese Economic Committee has been reported in previous telegrams. Regarding matters such as Sino-Japanese joint ventures, assisting the development of Chinese industries, and developing Sino-Japanese trade, the Foreign Minister hopes for the active involvement of Sino-Japanese private-sector industrialists. The Sino-Japanese Economic Committee, which will guide this movement, will be established separately in Osaka and Shanghai. The Japanese side will proceed with preparations, with the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry as the center. (United Press, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Recovering Bandit Areas: Measures for Food Relief to the People; Promulgated by the General Headquarters for Compliance by Eight Provinces</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: In order to maintain the food supply for the people in the counties recovered from banditry and to facilitate purchase and transportation, Chairman Chiang instructed the General Headquarters to formulate "Measures for Food Relief to the People in the Counties Recovered from Banditry." On the 2nd, the Chengdu Headquarters telegraphed the measures to the eight provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu for compliance. The telegram and measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram: It has been found that the counties on the northern and southern borders of Sichuan Province have long been plagued by bandits, and their assets have been depleted. During this period between harvests, there is a constant concern about the lack of rice and grain. The border counties of Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu are also mostly areas disturbed by bandits, and the fear of food shortages is likely unavoidable. Although local relief agencies can organize emergency relief efforts and provide some assistance, it is like a drop in the bucket and difficult to cover everyone. Therefore, the only important matter after the recovery of the counties and areas affected by bandits is the issue of food for the people. If regulations are not clearly defined and remedies are not properly planned, there will be no way to properly address the aftermath once rice and grain are lacking. Now, fourteen articles of the Measures for Food Relief to the People in the Counties Recovered from Banditry and sample forms have been formulated and are being issued via telegram. It is hoped that you will investigate, instruct your subordinates to comply with them conscientiously, and report on the implementation.</p>
<p>Measures: (1) The General Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government has specially formulated these measures in order to maintain the food supply for the people in the counties recovered from banditry and to facilitate purchase and transportation. (2) In any locality in a county recovered from banditry where there is a perceived food shortage, the county magistrate should investigate and determine the amount needed, and instruct the county chamber of commerce or charitable organizations and reputable merchants to prepare funds to purchase and transport supplies from neighboring provinces and counties for relief. (3) If the groups or merchants in counties severely affected by bandits are unable to prepare funds, the county magistrate may petition the provincial government to allocate funds from local public funds for use, and the funds will be returned from the proceeds of the sale. If there are no public funds available, the county magistrate is permitted to petition the provincial government to provide a loan, and the method of lending will be determined by the provincial government. (4) If the purchase and transportation of rice and grain are handled with public funds or funds allocated by the provincial government, the county government should select reliable personnel, and public groups should each appoint a representative to handle the matter jointly. (5) The county government of each county purchasing rice and grain should first submit a detailed report to the provincial government for approval, listing the disaster areas, the extent of the disaster, the current situation, the amount of rice and grain needed, the types and quantities of rice and grain to be purchased, the purchasing agencies, groups, or merchants, the names of the people responsible for purchasing, and the intended purchasing locations and transportation dates. (6) After the provincial government approves the rice and grain for food relief, a rice and grain transportation permit should be issued as proof, and all checkpoints along the route should be notified, and the military stationed along the route should be requested to allow passage without taxation and to provide effective protection. (7) The rice and grain transportation mentioned above should be delivered to the county within the specified time limit, and the transportation permit received must be submitted to the county government for forwarding to the provincial government for cancellation. (8) If the quantity of rice and grain transported by the transportation agency, group, or merchant does not match the quantity stated on the transportation permit, or if other goods or contraband are smuggled in an attempt to profit, the discovering agency may detain the excess rice and grain or smuggled items and report to their respective superiors, who will forward the report to the provincial government for handling. If there is intentional obstruction or extortion, the grain transportation agency, group, or merchant may report to the county government, which will forward the report to the provincial government for investigation. (9) When the grain arrives in the county, the purchasing agency or merchant should report the actual amount of rice and grain purchased, as well as the cost and freight charges, to the county government for verification and record. (10) The county government should immediately review and approve the selling price based on the above report, and designate the selling locations, notifying the public in advance. The selling price should not exceed the total cost and freight charges in principle, but if the purchase and transportation are funded by merchants, a net profit of 5% may be added to the cost. (11) If any grain transportation agency or merchant is found to be hoarding and raising prices or engaging in other fraudulent activities, the county government should investigate and report to the provincial government for punishment according to law. (12) These measures do not apply to areas that have not been affected by bandits. (13) These measures may be amended at any time by order if there are any omissions. (14) These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation (May 2nd).</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province's Progress in Civilizing the Li People</h3>
<p>The provincial government plans to establish three more counties in Li territory and seeks to assimilate the Han and Li peoples through cultural means.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Li and Miao peoples were originally indigenous to Guangdong and Guangxi. After the southward migration of the Han people, the Li and Miao in Guangxi retreated to Bapai, and those in Guangdong retreated to Qiongya (Hainan Island). Later, the Han people re-entered Qiongya, and the Li people retreated further inland. The thirteen counties now established along the coast of Qiongya are almost entirely inhabited by Han people. Although the land inhabited by the Li people is still under the jurisdiction of various counties, due to inconvenient transportation and differences in customs and language, the Li people are strong and fierce, making it impossible for the county government to implement any policies, thus creating a lawless situation. The Li people number over 500,000 and are divided into various groups: the Xiao Li, Xiao Xi, Li Chan, Sheng Tie Li, Da Bian Li, Hei Chan Li, Titou Li, and Miao people. The Li people often rely on their strength to bully the weak, commit violence against the few, and kill each other. Those who live close to the Han people often resort to violence over minor matters, killing and looting as if it were commonplace. If the government tries to enforce the law, they often harbor resentment, and the cunning ones take the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, after repeated suppression, it is ultimately difficult to quell them. Furthermore, the methods of governing the Li people in the past only sought to restrain them, rather than assimilate them with the Han people, making it difficult to achieve long-term peace and stability. Since implementing the three-year administration plan, the provincial government has been pacifying the regions and, after gradually suppressing the bandits and communists in Qiongya, has begun working to civilize the Li people. A commissioner for pacifying the Li people and a Li Affairs Bureau have been established to oversee the pacification. The commissioner for Qiongya, Chen Hanguang, previously accompanied over a hundred Lu Tong Li and Miao people from various tribes to Guangzhou for sightseeing and sent many Li and Miao people to the Yantang Military and Political School, other schools in Guangzhou, and various schools in Qiongya run by the provincial and local governments to study. The provincial government has also allocated educational funds to establish schools in Li territory, actively seeking to assimilate them. However, the work of pacifying the Li people is extremely difficult. Recently, the commissioner for pacifying the Li people has been abolished, and the Li Affairs Bureau is only a temporary organization and too small in scale. The bureau will also be abolished. However, in order to actively civilize the Li people, the provincial government plans to establish three more counties within their territory: (1) Establish a county to be named Le'an, with the county government located in Le'an, from the following areas of Changjiang County: Qiyi, Gan [illegible], Dongfang, Ma [illegible], Eyi, Eni, Zheinei Dong, Tianzhong, [illegible]gang and from the following areas of Yanan County: Le'an, Duojian Dong, Baoshan Dong, Baokang Dong, Longbi, Tanzhai, Duogang Dong, Toutang, Wanchong Dong, Fanyang Dong; and set up two assistant commissioner offices in Dongfang, Baozhao Dong. (2) Establish a county to be named Baoting, with the county government located in Baoshi, from the following areas of Yaxian County: Buda, Daluo, Shougang, Sangong, Baolong Dong, Zhoujia Dong, Shuiman Dong, Man Dong; from the following areas of Lingshui County: Baoshi, Wugong, Liugong, Qigong, Wuyadong, Lingmen Tuan, Baishi Tuan, Wuzhi Shan, Fenjie Ling, Diaoluo Shan; from the following areas of Wanning County: Shuisi, Nanhai Qiao, Xidong, Beidong; from the following areas of Lehui County: Zhugen Dong, Taiping Dong, Qiejie Dong, Heshui Tuan; and from the following areas of Ding'an County: Chuanbu, Nanyin Tuan, Jia Dong Tuan, Muri Shan; and set up two assistant commissioner offices in Zhugen Dong and Baishi Tuan. (3) Establish a county to be named Baisha, with the county government located in Baisha, from the following areas of Danxian County: Yayi Dong, Baisha Dong, Yuanmen Dong, Longtou Dong, Bingbang; from the following areas of Changjiang County: Bawang Dong, Wulie, Dapo, Baoping, Fengxu Dong; from the following areas of Gan'en County: Wushi Dong; from the following areas of Lingshui County: Nanliu Dong, Shiwan Dong; from the following areas of Ding'an County: Xinshi Ying, Genpu, Jia Chai Dong, Xiaoshui Dong, Sihe Dong; from the following areas of Yaxian County: Hongmao Shang Dong, Hongxia Dong, Daocai, Hongmao Cun; and from the following areas of Qiongshan County: Jialu Dong, Linwan Dong; and set up two assistant commissioner offices in Xinshi Ying and Bawang Dong. In the initial stages of establishing these three counties, the administration will be simple, and the county government organization and administrative expenses will differ from other counties. The county government organization will consist of one county magistrate, four assistant commissioners, three technicians, four clerks, four employees, four police chiefs, forty police officers, and eight yamen runners. Each county will receive monthly expenses of 1,700 yuan and a one-time construction fee of 500 yuan, and each county will receive 10,000 yuan for the construction of the county government and the assistant commissioner's offices. Educational funds have already been allocated, but since there is no local revenue, they will be disbursed from the provincial treasury. After the establishment of the county governments, in addition to governing the Li people and assimilating them through cultural means, they will actively build roads, reclaim land, teach the Li people various production techniques, and improve their living conditions and customs. This plan has been drafted by the Department of Civil Affairs and submitted to the provincial government for approval and will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Bandit Attempted Robbery at Jinshanwei Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Jinshanwei in Punan is a small coastal town under the jurisdiction of the eighth district of this county, where theft cases often occur. Early in the morning (30th), more than thirty bandits, carrying seven or eight rifles and speaking in mixed accents, came from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. They broke into Jiang Zhenxing's fish shop and robbed it. Zhang Xiaomei in the shop was beaten on the forehead by the bandits, and more than four hundred yuan were lost. Then they went to Qi Dague's rice shop and robbed more than three hundred yuan. Then they went to Wu Qisheng's store to rob, but the owner, Wu, escaped. At this time, the town police rang the gong to warn the town, and the villagers gathered upon hearing the sound and shouted to catch the thieves. The bandits dared not stay any longer and fired several shots as a warning, then fled east along the original road. The victims have not yet reported to the county to request an arrest. However, not long after the Jiangzhuang robbery, although Jinshanwei was fortunate enough not to be robbed, the villagers are all worried.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: County Government Takes Over the Bureau of Official Properties</h3>
<p>The matters relating to official properties in the four counties of Wuxian, Kunshan, Wujiang, and Changshu were originally handled by the Bureau of Official Properties of Wu, Kun, Jiang, and Chang. Now that the bureau has been ordered to be abolished, all matters relating to the official properties in the four counties are under the jurisdiction of the respective county governments. The magistrate of Wuxian County received the provincial order and specially sent Section Member Li to the bureau yesterday to take over all the files and equipment.</p>
<h3>County Anti-Smoking Association Builds a Prison</h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Anti-Smoking Committee has been handling smoking cases in recent months and has detained more than 200 smoking offenders. They are being held separately in the county government's Public Security Bureau detention center and the Land Rent Office sub-office. There is a feeling of overcrowding. In the future, when dealing with compulsory detoxification and abstinence ceremonies, it will inevitably be more crowded. It is necessary to build another prison. Therefore, the association decided to build a prison, which will cost about 20,000 yuan. It is planned to use the license fee item for expenditure. Yesterday (3rd), a plan was drafted and submitted to the provincial anti-smoking committee member Zeng for review. Construction will begin as soon as it is approved.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Trouble Caused by Competing to Buy Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>This year's spring silkworm eggs in Jiangsu Province are being shipped to Zhejiang Province in large numbers, resulting in a shortage of silkworm eggs in this province and causing great panic. In this county, only two or three out of ten villagers have been able to purchase silkworm eggs, and most have not been able to purchase them, which has a great impact on rural areas. The silkworm demonstration area in this county ordered 30,000 sheets of silkworm eggs from Japan. After they were transported to Wuxi, in addition to a portion being transported to Changzhou, Yixing, Jiangyin, Yangzhong, and other counties, Wuxi was allocated 18,000 sheets. In addition to the 11,000 sheets that had already been reserved, there were still 7,000 sheets, which were distributed by the demonstration area to the Wuxi Hotel, Dadong Hotel, and New Hotel, and other silkworm egg sales points on the road, limited to sale at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (3rd). The demonstration area also sent personnel to supervise. However, it was a drop in the bucket and did not help, and the villagers were in urgent need. At dawn, they went to wait for the sale on an empty stomach. There were no less than several thousand people. When it came to the sale, everyone scrambled to be first, and the old and weak could not buy them and were squeezed. At that time, the noise was deafening, and the order was chaotic. Then there were many rogues who saw the opportunity and rushed forward to grab the silkworm eggs, resulting in great chaos. The situation was serious. The counter glass windows of the Dadong Hotel were all damaged. The Wuxi Hotel closed the iron gate tightly to avoid being damaged. Later, the demonstration area reported the situation to the county government, which ordered the security team police to the scene to maintain order. The rogues who caused the incident had already fled. Only seven villagers, Shen Jusheng, Hua Panlin, Zhang Genfa, Gu Heshang, Ni Aixiu, Zhang Fenzu, and Zhu Weixuan, were taken to the second sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the General Bureau for investigation. Now, the demonstration area is extremely panicked due to the shortage of species and is properly seeking relief.</p>
<h3>Major Robbery and Assault Case Occurs in Downtown Area</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (2nd), at around 6:00 p.m., a major robbery and assault case suddenly occurred at Zhang Yuchang Rice Shop in Huangni Bee outside the South Gate. Residents bravely captured three robbers. The details have been briefly recorded in this newspaper's telegram. It is now known that Zhang Yuchang Rice Shop, which was robbed, has been open for 30 years. The owner's name is Zhang Xiufang. Recently, he purchased 56 and a half dan of coarse japonica rice from Yuan He Tian Rice Shop, worth 531 yuan. At around 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Yuan He sent a clerk, Shen Qingrong, to the shop to collect the money. Zhang Xiufang's son, Lanchen, checked the accounts with Shen at the counter and took out 300 yuan in banknotes from the table in preparation for delivery. At that moment, a robber suddenly rushed into the counter, first pushed Shen Qingrong to the ground, and then searched the 300 yuan in banknotes on the table and put them into a bag. There were two more robbers, each holding a pistol, guarding the door. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, they fired a shot as a warning. Fortunately, no one was injured. The three robbers then fled toward Huangniqiao. Seeing that the robbers had left, the shop immediately reported to the police station and sent police to search for them. At the same time, the shop's apprentice, Zhu Jubao, and the shop clerk, Ren Ajiu, bravely chased after the robbers, shouting loudly. The neighbors heard the sound and rushed out, gathering more and more people to help chase the robbers. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers turned back and fired two shots, but the crowd still chased after them relentlessly. The robbers ran wildly through the downtown area, as if they were in a no-man's land. The patrol police along the way, because they were unarmed, did not dare to stop them. When they reached the corner next to a small silk factory, one robber hit the wall and fell to the ground, but he still got up and ran away, firing continuously. When they fled to Yao Lane, a resident, Ren [illegible], heard the noise and came out to watch. As soon as she stepped out of the gate, she was shot in the right waist by a stray bullet from the robber and fell to the ground immediately, bleeding profusely and unconscious. She was immediately sent to Puren Hospital for treatment, and her life is in critical condition. Afterwards, the robbers continued to fire more than ten shots, but the crowd was still chasing them, and the sound of gongs and police sirens rang out. They also threw stones at the robbers. A robber named Wang Xisheng had his head broken by a stone and was kicked to the ground by Wang Jinfu, who was catching the robbers. The robber was captured, and a Browning pistol was seized. Afterwards, Zhao Yun and others, who were catching the robbers, captured two more robbers, You Guozhen and Xu Jinlin, one after another, and seized another pistol and three bullets. The three robbers were tied up with ropes and sent to the third sub-bureau for questioning. They confessed to the robbery. It was decided that they would be sent to the county for trial today. It is also known that Nanli Township Chief Wang Jiehui and others specially convened a Baojia meeting yesterday to discuss security issues and submitted a request to the authorities for awards to be given to the villagers who captured the robbers with their bare hands.</p>
<h3>Department Orders Reduction of Dry Cocoon Freight Rates</h3>
<p>Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory, due to the slump in the silk market and the decreasing number of local cocoons in Wuxi, which affected the raw materials for silk production, specially organized Tongyi Company to purchase fresh cocoons from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, Hubei, and other provinces, dry them, and transport them to Wuxi. The Chamber of Commerce sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways, requesting that this dry cocoon be exempted from transit tax when passing through customs and that freight rates be reduced in order to reduce costs and maintain the silk industry, which is on the verge of collapse. Yesterday, an order was received from the Ministry of Finance stating that the transit tax had been submitted by the department for abolition and would be implemented on a regular basis. All requests for the issuance of dry cocoon passports were not approved. At the same time, an order was received from the Ministry of Railways stating that the request to reduce dry [cocoon] freight rates had been referred to the Jinpu, Jiaoji, Longhai, Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Pinghan, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureaus. They replied that dry cocoon freight rates had already been reduced to the third class, and the minimum amount for full-car shipments had been changed from one-third to one-half of the vehicle's carrying capacity. In addition, there are progressive distance reduction methods for reported joint transportation. Compared to the past, it has already been reduced a lot, and there is no need to reduce it further. However, it was found that there was no road transportation of dry cocoons from Qingzhou to Wuxi, and the freight rate for sea transportation via Qingdao was unknown and difficult to investigate at one time. If it is indeed lower than the railway, the merchant can collect and submit the proof documents, and they will be reviewed in detail and appropriately reduced to attract business. They should be directly submitted to the railway for verification and decision.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Two Criminals Arrested in Kidnapping Case of Liu Hangsu</h3>
<p>Liu Hangsu, the second son of the late painter Liu Quran of Wuyi, Dongxiatang, went to Xizizhou on January 13th of this year to collect rent and was kidnapped by bandits. There has been no news of him. It has been more than three months. The bandits knew that a party member, Luan Dechun, had recently been sent to Changzhou to negotiate ransom matters. The Liu family hired a certain Chan to negotiate with him. As a result, they agreed to pay a ransom of 5,000 yuan, but at that time, due to difficulties in raising funds, it was not resolved. Unexpectedly, the bandit Yue Dechun recently had a fight with someone in Maqiao, Taixing, and was captured by the Maqiao Self-Defense Corps and temporarily detained. Upon hearing the news, the Wuyi Detective Team went to pick him up and brought him to Changzhou the night before last. In addition, Chen Bojiu, the captain of the 3rd Security Team, arrested a bandit, Yin Hongda, at Qixigang at the same time and brought him to Changzhou. Both criminals have confessed to the kidnapping in the team. They were sent to the county government for interrogation on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Bandits Attempt to Rob Shangsanhe Town</h3>
<p>At around 6:00 p.m. yesterday (1st), eight or nine bandits suddenly arrived in Shangsanhe Town in the second district, intending to rob it. They were discovered by the merchants and residents of the town, who reported to the Public Security Sub-Station. Patrol Chief Gu led more than ten police officers to search and arrest them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits opened fire to resist, wounding merchant Cai Boxian's right hand. They then scattered and fled. After the police officers tried their best to pursue them, they captured three bandits and seized a box gun and more than ten bullets. The remaining bandits escaped without a trace. That night, the sub-station sent the three bandits and guns to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Confiscation of Firearms Being Smuggled</h3>
<p>Recently, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the villages of this county. The firearms and bullets used by the bandits are secretly transported from Shanghai to Haimen. Therefore, the police teams in each port have been strictly inspecting disembarking passengers. Yesterday morning, a passenger with a local accent came to Haimen from Shanghai by boat. He disembarked from Qinglonggang. When he walked to Sanchang Town, a patrol officer saw that his appearance was suspicious and stopped him for inspection. Five pistols were found on his waist. The person and the stolen goods were taken to the bureau and sent to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: The Puqi Road Disturbance Subsides</h3>
<p>The Construction Bureau of this county, having been ordered to construct the Yangjing section of Puqi Road, commenced work on April 30th. The construction recently reached the Wanglou Township and Xiannv Temple in the fourth district. Unexpectedly, when work began on April 30th, a portion of the populace, failing to understand the importance of the project, requested that construction be postponed until after the wheat harvest. This led to a gathering of people obstructing the work, creating a disturbance. Liu Zhaorong, the head of the fourth district, considered the matter significant and immediately telegraphed the county government's Construction Bureau to request instructions. County Magistrate Ma promptly ordered Construction Bureau Chief Shu Guohua and Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang to rush to the scene to handle the situation. After arriving at Xiannv Temple, they immediately convened a meeting with the heads of all townships and towns in the district, informing them that the road was being constructed under strict orders from the capital and province, with a deadline for completion that could not be delayed. Regarding the wheat in the fields, approval had been obtained from the Construction Department to provide reasonable compensation. Every effort would be made to resolve any losses to the people's land. He hoped that the township and town heads would inform the populace not to be manipulated by a few individuals. The villagers, realizing that they could not resist, resumed work in sections that very afternoon and aimed to complete the project by May 10th.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Society Distributes Disaster Relief Funds in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Due to the exceptionally severe drought in the western mountains of this county, the China Jisheng Society dispatched representatives to Yiju Ji, Chenjia Ji, Liujia Ji, Xiejia Ji, Tiepai Dian, Gujing Temple, and other locations in the eighth district to investigate the disaster conditions. They selected households severely affected by the disaster and distributed relief tickets. The investigation has now been completed, and it has been decided to distribute relief funds according to the ticket denominations on the 4th and 5th at Tianning Temple. All sectors were also notified in advance to arrive at the venue on time to supervise the distribution.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Wireless Radio Station Established in Tongcheng</h3>
<p>To facilitate the implementation of government orders in the northern Jiangsu counties, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has established a wireless radio station in Tongcheng. Receiving and transmitting equipment has already been transported via the Shanjin Tianlun steamer. The radio station will be attached to the Nantong District Administrative Inspector's Office. The provincial government will subsidize 60% of the monthly expenses, with the remaining funds to be raised by the commissioner.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing: Robbery Occurs in Zhangjia Li</h3>
<p>The Jin family on the south bank of Zhangjia in Sun Township, Shaoxing, was targeted by bandits due to their substantial wealth. Around 2 AM on the 2nd, more than ten bandits wielding firearms suddenly broke into the house and conducted a thorough search and robbery. For over an hour, they looted the property of Jin Shouxiang, Jin Fushou, Jin Jimei, and three other households living in the compound.</p>

<h3>Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday Morning: Over a Thousand Students and Citizens Attended</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation held the opening ceremony of the Seventh District National Goods Exhibition at Tongji Vocational Middle School in Jiangwan at 9 AM yesterday. In addition to representatives from various agencies and organizations, Mayor Wu (represented by Pan Gongzhan), Pan Gongzhan, Tong Xingbai, Chen Jicheng, Wang Zhongming, Yan Zhengqing, Yang Weiyu, Tang Ying, and others, as well as students from ten schools, including Xinmin Middle School, Lida College, Tongji Vocational Middle School, Yuqing Middle School, Hongjiang Middle School, Jiangxi Elementary School, and Xinmin Commercial School, and approximately one thousand citizens attended.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The general assembly was held at the affiliated vocational school of Tongji University at Jiangwan Station. The national flag and the Party flag were hung at the main entrance, along with a banner reading "Shanghai Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation National Student Supplies Exhibition." The exhibition and the platform were set up in the auditorium. Boy Scouts from Xinmin and Lida Middle Schools were responsible for maintaining order at the venue and the entrance. Exquisite products from various national goods factories were displayed at the venue, and a sales department was attached. The arrangement was extremely exquisite. On the left and right sides, eye-catching cartoons and slogans promoting the use of national goods were posted everywhere.</p>
<p>Slogans</p>
<p>In order to promote the concept of using national goods among students and citizens, the conference particularly shouted slogans: "1. We students are the vanguard of using national goods. 2. We must be responsible for persuading the entire society to use national goods. 3. We must promote the manufacture of national goods. 4. We must promote the sales of national goods. 5. Using national goods is cultivating national strength. 6. Using national goods is solving the livelihood problems of the entire nation." Slogans were also posted everywhere, such as "Use domestic products of our own country to seek self-reliance," "Using national goods can increase the national economy," "Those who buy foreign goods are ashamed even if they are rich," "Use your own strength to seek self-reliance," and "Using domestic products of our own country can save the country," etc.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony was performed, Tong Xingbai of the presidium first reported, "Dear students, dear guests, today is the opening ceremony of the National Goods Year Promotion Federation's Seventh District National Student Supplies Exhibition. Not long ago, we held a city-wide student oath ceremony to use national goods. I believe everyone present has participated. The significance of this district exhibition lies in material, because the significance of the last oath ceremony lay in spirit. Therefore, we are now using material to supplement the lack of spirit, so as to strengthen the concept of using national goods. General exhibitions are mostly held in cities, so this time we are holding it in rural areas, so that citizens and students in rural areas can have the opportunity to thoroughly understand national goods. Therefore, we deeply hope that students and citizens in the seventh district can cherish this exhibition, which has great significance. There are two meanings to holding it in rural areas this time. First, to enable people in rural areas to see various exquisite national goods, so that they can make a comparison with foreign goods. Second, to enable the people to see national goods and then trigger the concept of using national goods. Therefore, I hope that after you visit the exhibition, you can immediately resolve to use national goods and persuade relatives and friends to use national goods." Then, Wang Zhongming of the presidium reported on the preparations, and Chen Jicheng, a representative of the University Faculty and Staff Association, and Cao Zhigong, a representative of the National Goods Factory, made speeches.</p>
<p>Grand Event</p>
<p>After the ceremony, they visited the exhibition. Xiangshi Chinese and French Pharmacy, Tianzhang Paper Mill, Aihua Pharmaceutical Company, Weiyi Specialty Manufacturing Factory, and others specially presented exquisite products. At the same time, each factory in the sales department sold various exquisite products at discounted prices. Visitors were able to purchase inexpensive and beautiful national goods. It was also heard that in order to arouse the interest of visitors and to enable them to have a deeper understanding of national goods, the association specially collected manufacturing process films from various national goods factories and screened them from 7 PM to 9 PM in the evening. Anyone who purchased more than two jiao of goods in the sales department would receive an admission ticket. If national goods manufacturers are willing to lend the films, please send them to the association's office at No. 80 Longhua Road, etc.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Discusses Matters Related to Three Banks' Relief to Industry and Commerce; Russian Ambassador Visited Yesterday for General Courtesy; Bank of China to Expand Deposit Savings</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, received reporters from various newspapers at the Shanghai Office of the Economic Council on West Adams Road at 5 PM yesterday and spoke freely about matters related to the three banks' relief to industry and commerce. The various situations are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting with the Soviet Russian Ambassador</p>
<p>Song met with Soviet Russian Ambassador Bogomolov at his private residence on Sheqi Road at 4 PM yesterday. The discussion lasted for half an hour. After Ambassador Bao resigned, he immediately met with reporters from various newspapers. According to Song, Ambassador Bao's visit to him was purely for ordinary courtesy and did not involve political issues between the two countries.</p>
<p>Relief Funds for Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the three banks providing relief to industry and commerce, Song replied to reporters' questions that the decline of industry and commerce really urgently needs relief. It has been decided that the Central, China, and Communications Banks will allocate 20 million yuan for loans. Finance Minister Kong is in charge of this matter. As far as he knows, a 5 million yuan small loan for industrial and commercial credit will be established first, and it is now being actively carried out. As for the money borrowed by the three banks, more than 10 million yuan has been released by the end of last week, etc.</p>
<p>Expand Deposit Savings</p>
<p>The articles of association of the Bank of China have been revised, and it has now been decided to expand deposit savings, which has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and will be implemented immediately. The branches of the Bank of China are all over the mainland, so after the expansion of deposit savings, considerable achievements can definitely be obtained. Bian Fusheng has been decided to be the director of the savings department. Song then said that after the expansion of savings matters, the power to relieve the countryside will also inevitably increase, because according to the bank savings law, one-fifth of the deposit savings should be withdrawn and invested in rural relief matters. Therefore, the Bank of China will pay more attention to rural economic relief work in the future and hopes to make every effort to carry it out, so that rural finance will gradually develop. The examination of the reports on the achievements of various banks investing in rural areas has proved that lending to rural areas is better than lending to cities, because borrowers in the interior have land and industry as collateral, which is very stable and reliable, and cannot be compared with huge urban companies that open in the morning and close in the evening. Regarding this level, not only the Bank of China pays attention to it, but all banks also express sympathy.</p>
<p>Sun's Mission to the Northwest</p>
<p>President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Zhesheng, will go to the Northwest to investigate in the near future. His mission is twofold: first, to draft various laws and regulations for the Legislative Yuan and to investigate the people's conditions; and second, to handle the affairs of the National Economic Council, because Sun is also one of the standing committee members of the Economic Council. Therefore, during Sun's trip, all matters related to the Economic Council that urgently need to be investigated will be investigated one by one. His itinerary includes the northwestern provinces, Qinghai, and other areas, but it will be very short. As for British railway rights holder Brigadier General Edmund, who came to China to investigate our country's railway system, he was hired by our government and not by the Economic Council. Hai is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 5th.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Sericulture Loan</p>
<p>The Zhejiang silk and cocoon industry needed funds to purchase silk and cocoons, and representatives, including Zhu Fucheng, were sent to request a loan from the Bank of China. This has been reported. As far as he knows, Zhu has met with Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department. According to Zeng's opinion, the method of borrowing 3 million yuan from the banking industry last year will still be followed. As for the preparation of the Rural Business Cooperation Committee, he does not know its contents. In short, the Economic Council will take the method of assisting and promoting this kind of matter from the sidelines. The association may be started by the banking industry, etc.</p>
<h3>Accidents Involving Northern Shipping Lines: Lisheng Grounded, Beikang Collides</h3>
<p>Lisheng Grounded at Gukou</p>
<p>The Yih and Company Northern Line regular liner Lisheng loaded cargo and passengers from Tianjin this time and set sail from Tianjin on the night of the first of this month. Guided by a pilot, it left the Baihe River to Dagukou to go to sea, first to Zhifu, and then to Shanghai. The ship sailed to Dagukou on the 2nd (Thursday). Because the pilot went the wrong channel, the Lisheng's hull was grounded on the shallow sand at Dagukou. The Lisheng had a deeper draft and was heavily loaded, causing the hull to be trapped in the shallow sand and unable to escape.</p>
<p>Beikang Collides on Entry</p>
<p>The Northern Shipping Company's Beikang, with a deadweight of 1,013 tons, was loading a large batch of flour and groceries in Shanghai this time and sailed to Dagu on the morning of the 2nd of this month. While entering Gukou, the Lisheng was already grounded at Dagukou, and its grounded position was at the key point of the Dagukou's shipping route for entry and exit. When the Beikang entered Dagukou, its hull collided with the Lisheng. The bows and outer sides of both ships were damaged.</p>
<p>Reporting the Situation to Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yih and Company and the Northern Company both received telegrams from Tianjin reporting that after the stranded Lisheng collided with the Beikang, they had reported to the Tianjin Customs and sent personnel to inspect the ships. On the one hand, the shipowners telegraphed Shanghai to report. Now the company has telegraphed the law firm to send a ship to tow it out when the tide rises. The damage situation is unknown, but it is generally not obstructing navigation and can still come to Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th, but it is now inevitably postponed. How much damage there is will be inspected after arriving in Shanghai. The Beikang has also telegraphed Shanghai to inform them.</p>
<p>Notification to Insurance Company</p>
<p>The Northern Company obtained a telegram from the Beikang yesterday and immediately informed the relevant insurance company, briefly stating that it had received a telegram from the Beikang stating that the Lisheng was grounded at Gukou and the Beikang collided with the Lisheng when entering the river (i.e., entering Dagukou). The rest will be detailed in a letter, etc. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from this newspaper went to the Northern Company to inquire. It was said that the wording of the collision was extremely simple and it was still impossible to know everything in detail. The situation will only be clear after a follow-up telegram arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry and Three Banks to Discuss Implementation of Relief Loans; Funds Approved by the Money Industry to be Collected in Preparation</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai industry and commerce passed the end of April, most of the credit loans and mortgage loans that were due were extended. The Shanghai interbank offered rate announced by the silver and money market yesterday morning and afternoon was 1.8 fen, a decrease of 0.2 fen compared to April 30th. The added water has also declined, which proves that the money supply in Shanghai has gradually eased.</p>
<p>Silver and Money Industry to Discuss Implementation</p>
<p>Of the 20 million yuan relief loans for industry and commerce, 15 million yuan are mortgage guarantee loans, which will be handled by the Central, China, and Communications Banks. 5 million yuan are credit guarantee loans, of which members of the Banking Industry Association Money Shop have approved 250,000 yuan. The remaining 2.845 million yuan will be handled by the Central Bank, etc. It has now been decided to discuss the implementation methods according to the ten loan principles promulgated by the Ministry of Finance in the past two days.</p>
<p>Money Industry Notice to Members to Comply</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association issued a notice to its members yesterday based on the resolution of the 19th meeting of the 2nd Board of Directors, asking them to comply. The approved 250,000 yuan credit guarantee loans will be borne equally by the members, a total of 65 shops, each about 4,000 yuan. Each shop will transfer the money to the Money Industry Joint Preparation Warehouse, which will collect it. After the implementation methods of the relief loans have been discussed, they will be implemented.</p>

<h3>Literacy Movement Week Business Day: City Chamber of Commerce Issues Letter to Merchants</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the business promotion day for the literacy education promotion week in this city. The City Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to merchants, stating that the authorities in this city, in order to relieve the illiterate people in the urban area, have decided to organize compulsory literacy education for one year, from July 1, 1935, to June 30, 1936. The method is that the literacy education committee currently organized in this city will establish hundreds of literacy schools starting from July 1 this year, compelling illiterate people to go to school in batches for one hour a day for two months. Employers of store employees or workers have an obligation to facilitate the above-mentioned classes. The current procedures are to start with the committee investigating the illiterate people on a household-by-shop basis. The significance of the promotion week is to try to make the general public understand the importance of literacy education and create a warm and strong interest in literacy education, so that the literacy education organized in this city can be carried out smoothly. This is the origin of the business community for organizing literacy education in this city and the significance of the promotion week that should be understood first. Secondly, what is the relationship between literacy education and merchants? In other words, it is the center of this problem, that is, the purpose of this association issuing a letter to merchants this time. The merchants in our country have always had a fundamental misconception that once a merchant enters a store, business is important and reading is light. There are very few apprentices who are studious and study on their own in their spare time, and there are none who are not reprimanded by the shopkeeper. Some even say that the rise and establishment of previous generations all came from practical training, and they never made a living on paper. These remarks originally had considerable reasons when used in the self-sufficient commerce of the closed era, but since the world is open and the power of foreign economic oppression has increased day by day, no matter what industry, one must be familiar with economic principles and understand the news of foreign markets to plan a response. Literacy education is the tool to know economic principles and understand foreign news. Therefore, the purpose of organizing literacy education is not to create useless bookworms for the business community, but to create a healthy merchant for the business war era who can fight when advancing and defend when retreating. In order to achieve this goal, the current literacy education is only implementing the initial stage. Generally, a company or a store is an entire organization in nature. From the manager to the employees, if there is an unsound member, there will inevitably be some shortcomings in the operation of the business. Therefore, in recent years, shopkeepers who understand things and stores with larger scales have all set up employee tutoring education. Even if they do not run employee tutoring education themselves, they often reward the extracurricular tutoring of employees and apprentices and do not hinder them. This is enough to prove that the importance of allowing illiterate merchants to make up for their studies has gradually been understood by the general public. This is something that store owners have mutually beneficial benefits, and I hope that the general store owners will not misunderstand that it hinders store affairs. Furthermore, the concept of merchants in our country has always been that store owners regard partners as guests and hosts, and store owners regard apprentices as masters and brothers. There is almost no one who does not hope that they will be successful in the future and glorify the village. This kind of public and universal mind is really the virtue that our country has passed down from ancient times. Therefore, encouraging them to make up for their illiteracy, so that they can increase their commercial knowledge, so as to be able to establish themselves in the future, is even more the obligation that today's store owners and managers should have. I hope that the general merchants in this city will understand this meaning.</p>

<h3>Art Exhibition: Preview on the 26th</h3>
<p>Yesterday (March 3rd) was the 26th day of the Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. The grand scene of visitors remained unabated. There are now only two days left for this preview. Art lovers should not miss the opportunity. The news from yesterday is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Director Ma of the Palace Museum</p>
<p>The association will close the preview soon, and various exhibits will begin to be packed after the closing. Seven-tenths of these ancient objects, Zhuang Shangyan and staff Niu Deming, etc., went along. Now it is found that Zhuang, etc. are still in Ping and have not returned. The association telegraphed Director Ma of the Palace Museum yesterday to inform him and asked him to arrive in Shanghai five days ago. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Director Ma of the Palace Museum in Peiping, the exhibits are scheduled to be packed on the 16th. Please inform the personnel going abroad to be responsible for counting and sealing before the 5th. Art Exhibition Dong,</p>
<p>Pelliot Leaves for the North Yesterday</p>
<p>British Committee Member Professor Pelliot has left for Peiping yesterday. It is not certain whether he will ask the British Committee members in Ping to return to Shanghai together or go to Japan.</p>
<p>Rushing to Make Boxes for Transport to England</p>
<p>After the preview is closed this time, all the exhibits will be carefully packed. The wooden boxes this time are made by Dashin Leather Box Factory and China Leather Box Factory in this port, with iron skin nailed on the outside, which is extremely strong. The various antiques are first made into small boxes according to their size, and then the small boxes are loaded into large boxes, wrapped in cotton, which is extremely complete. Most of the large and small boxes have been made, and the rest are being rushed to be made so that they can be installed on the 6th.</p>
<p>Wang Qingmu Visits</p>
<p>Wang Qingmu, a senior gentleman from Jiangsu and the current director of the Huai River project, also went to the association at 9 AM yesterday to visit. Wang is over ancient age, but he is full of energy. He was very interested in the calligraphy, painting, and antiques displayed by the association and browsed for as long as three hours.</p>
<p>Wang Guoxiu's Thoughts</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Guoxiu published his thoughts in the China Review Weekly yesterday. The original title was Chinese Influence On English Porcelain And Furniture. His insights are incisive and his writing is fluent. The main points are excerpted and translated as follows: Since the establishment of the East India Company, the trade between China and England has developed extremely rapidly. Among the decorations exported by China, porcelain ranks first and lacquerware ranks second. In the 18th century, British women mostly placed tea tables, flower vases, and porcelain vases at home. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, the British built kilns in England to make porcelain. However, the raw materials for this porcelain mostly came from overseas, and they initially imitated the styles of Chinese porcelain, and they liked to use oriental blue and white ware as the style. The Kangxi kiln and Qianlong kiln in this preview, such as the blue and white awl arch chrysanthemum petal flower sprinkler No. 226 and the white banana leaf thunder pattern jue imitating the Ding kilns No. 248, were the styles in the 18th century that the British used as models. Also, the enamel color yellow ground tangled peony pattern, and the white awl arch cloud bat string pattern pot imitating the Ding kilns No. 246, were also the items that British women loved to play with most in the 18th century. Later, the Bow Worcester and Chelsea factories in England manufactured fine porcelain, but their styles and colors still used Chinese porcelain as the standard. The porcelain is mostly painted with Chinese landscape figures, flowers, and birds. The porcelain No. 239 enamel color bamboo and sparrow garden wine bell, the blue and white fish dragon transformation large wash No. 194, and the enamel color hundred flower land open light blue material landscape handle in this preview were all the things that the British envied most at that time. Porcelain makers thought they were imitating them. As for lacquerware, it was also a decoration for wealthy British families. The ones made in England were completely imitated Chinese styles. The No. 1 gold footrest in the furniture category in this preview reminds people of the utensils used in England in the 18th century. However, the development of lacquerware making in England is not as developed as porcelain making. After that, the interest of the British in using Chinese furniture gradually decreased, but in the history of British art, we can still see the influence of China.</p>
<h3>Ge Zhi Public School Textbook: "Manchukuo" Scraped off Maps</h3>
<p>The Ge Zhi Public School, established by the Public Works Department, previously used geography maps that included the term "Manchukuo." Consequently, the school's students, believing this violated the League of Nations' resolution denying recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo, requested the school authorities to replace them. Subsequently, the school's vice-principal immediately collected the sold maps from the students, issuing each a receipt pending further action. It is now reported that on the day before yesterday (the 2nd), the school clerk, acting on the principal's orders, announced that the maps had been revised and that students could claim them from the office upon presentation of their receipts. It is learned that the school had used a knife to scrape off the words "Manchukuo" "Nlonchukuo" and "國 Kuo" from the maps before returning them.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council: Bureau to Move to New Premises on the 5th</h3>
<p>The new premises of the Municipal Police Bureau on Penglai Road were constructed by the Sheng Yunji Construction Company. The project was fully completed last month.

On the 6th (Monday), all staff will begin working in the new premises. No moving ceremony will be held, only a report on the moving process will be given by the moving committee during the memorial week.</p>
<h3>Telephone Bureau: Director Xu Returns to Shanghai from Sichuan After Completing Official Duties</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications considered Yichang to be an important town in Western Hubei, a major trading port. The commercially operated Qingxin Telephone Company there was corrupt and incompetent. Therefore, it ordered Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, to go there to take over and reorganize the company, with a deadline of completion by April. Director Xu led his staff to Yichang on February 17th and established a preparatory office on the 18th to begin work. Because the machinery and equipment were old and dilapidated, and the poles and lines were rusty, it was impossible to reorganize them. Therefore, it was decided to completely replace them. At the same time, negotiations were conducted to take over the company. However, it was during the Lunar New Year holiday, the water level was low, and the cables and equipment were bulky and difficult to transport, resulting in delays. In addition, there were no poles available locally for purchase, so staff had to be sent to Hankou to procure them. Going upstream was difficult, and loading and transporting them was a challenge. All the equipment finally arrived in Yichang on March 22nd. Construction began on January 28th, and after working day and night, it was completed and put into operation on April 5th. The sound was clear and distinct, the connections were quick, and the users were very satisfied. The entire project took only 36 days. All the old poles and lines of the commercial company were leaning and disorderly, which was unsightly, so they were dismantled to improve the appearance of the city. The work has now been completed, and it was handed over to the Yichang Telegraph Bureau on April 28th. The Ministry of Communications also considered Chengdu to be the capital of Sichuan Province, and telephone communications were very important during the current period of bandit suppression. Therefore, Director Xu was again sent to the west to inspect and design improvements, including the installation of a 1,000-line common battery switchboard. Having completed his official duties, it is reported that all staff, except for a portion of the line workers who were transferred to Chengdu, are scheduled to return to Shanghai in early May to prepare the machinery, equipment, and tools needed for Chengdu.</p>
<h3>Leather and Silk Tobacco Industry Association: Telegraphs Fujian Province to Stop Collecting Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Leather and Silk Tobacco Industry Association telegraphed the Fujian Provincial Finance Department on April 28th, stating: "To Xu Jun, Director of the Fujian Provincial Finance Department: Since Yongding tobacco silk has already paid the special tax, it should not be subject to business tax again. We earnestly request that you quickly order the Yongding Business Tax Collection Office to stop collecting business tax on tobacco silk, to avoid double taxation and to relieve the merchants and people. We await your command with utmost urgency. The Shanghai Leather and Silk Tobacco Industry Association bows."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Submits to Ministry of Finance: Request to Exempt Leather Export Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Re: Request. On the 1st of this month, the Leather, Fur, Oil, and Bone Trade Association sent a letter stating that animal hides are divided into wild and domestic animals. Wild animals include tigers, leopards, foxes, deer, raccoon dogs, wildcats, field mice, and weasels, which are produced in open fields or hidden in valleys. Domestic animals include lake sheep and rabbits, which are raised by villagers in gardens. Every winter, when farming is done, farmers switch from farming to hunting, slaughtering animals for their hides to sell and supplement their livelihoods. The above-mentioned hides are not used domestically and are entirely sold abroad. Exports have been substantial for many years. Therefore, the hides industry benefits the national economy and people's livelihoods to a great extent. In recent years, it has been subject to competition from dumping by Japan and Russia, and has been affected by the global economic panic and the increase in the price of silver. As a result, the sales of Chinese animal hides have declined daily, and the market price has plummeted. Not only have inland vendors and urban leather merchants suffered losses and found it difficult to survive, but the value obtained by farmers selling their hides has been insufficient to cover the cost of hunting or the cost of feed. If this continues without any effort to save the industry, hunting will inevitably cease in the wild, and merchants will stop trading in the market. The elimination of China's hide export industry is imminent. The harm to the national economy and people's livelihoods is immeasurable. Japan and Russia provide comprehensive protection for the hide industry, such as establishing ranches, increasing production, and exempting export taxes to facilitate exports. They also have incentive measures for hide exporters. Therefore, Japanese and Russian hides have no fear in the European and American markets and are dumped in large quantities. The increase in sales over the years has been rapid. On the other hand, Chinese hides are burdened by heavy export tariffs, and inland transportation is difficult, with costs increasing due to multiple transfers by boats and vehicles. Due to various factors, the cost is higher. Compared to Japanese and Russian goods, the difference is like heaven and earth. China's trade deficit in recent years has been alarming. The only thing that helps is the export of domestic goods to offset it. However, since overseas countries have raised the price of silver, Chinese exports have been greatly hit. The hide industry relies on exports, so it is the first to be affected. The impact is immeasurable. The association has witnessed the crisis and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we present the facts and request that your association forward them to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to exempt all kinds of animal hides from export tariffs and quickly devise fundamental policies to save farmers and merchants in order to maintain a portion of the vitality of the country. We await your command with utmost urgency." The association also noted that the export sales of raw and tanned hides in the past year decreased by nearly 90% compared to 1933. In order to maintain trade balance and encourage import and export trade, it is necessary to reduce or exempt taxes. Reports indicate that the Ministry is preparing to abolish all transit taxes and is considering reducing or exempting export taxes based on trade conditions. The circumstances described by the industry are consistent with the Ministry's current proposed reduction or exemption standards. Based on the foregoing, we respectfully submit this report and request that your Ministry review and approve the association's request for the sake of public convenience.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department: Decision on Re-election of Medical Committee</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Director of the Public Works Department's Health Department to the Board of Directors, the re-election of the Shanghai Medical Committee has been completed by the respective medical associations. The following representatives have been appointed: Dr. Porter represents the Shanghai Medical Association, Dr. White represents the Medical Missionary Association, Dr. Fu Wenshou represents the Chinese Medical Association, Dr. Bader represents the German Medical Association, Dr. Donon represents the Japanese Medical Society, Dr. Tilly represents the Russian Medical Society, Dr. Xu Naili represents the Shanghai Physicians' Association, and Dr. Engel represents the German-speaking Physicians' Association. The Public Works Department has approved and recorded the names of the above representatives. The Public Works Department has also continued to appoint Dr. Oehler as the representative of the Bureau. The term of office of each representative is two years, starting from April 1st of this year. In addition, the Director of the Public Works Department's Health Department is a member ex officio according to the articles of association.</p>
<h3>Apprehension of Robbers: Incidentally Uncovered a Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Liu Junxiang, a Chinese detective of the Laozha Police Station, along with detective inspectors Pang Ruiqing and He Xuezhi, learned that Gu Fengshan, a robber from Haimen who had robbed property from No. 55, Lane 107, Parker Road, was hiding in Room 7 of the Zhonghe Hotel, Lane 150, Fujian Road. Therefore, at 11:30 AM on the day before yesterday, they reported to Chief Chinese Detective You Aji and went to the address to arrest him. Unexpectedly, a fraud case was also uncovered. Gu Fengshan and his friends Zhang Lianfu from Chongming, Shen Zijiang from Haimen, and Yang Peiran from Shaoxing, etc., stayed in Room 16 of the Lin'an Hotel, Lane 108, Guangdong Road, on the 29th of last month. The next morning, they discovered that clothing worth more than 40 yuan had been stolen. They negotiated with the hotel without success. They then ordered Hu Sanqing, the owner of the Lin'an Hotel, to go to the Zhonghe Hotel and force them to pay 46 yuan. After repeated negotiations, Hu handed over 20 yuan, the banknotes of which were marked with secret marks, and Zhang Lianfu received them. At this time, police detectives arrived and arrested Liu and the other three people. The original stolen 20 yuan was found on Zhang, and a pawn ticket from Yufeng Pawnshop was found on Gu Fengshan. The item pawned was a diamond ring robbed from Parker Road. They were all taken back to the police station. The victims came to identify them, but none could identify them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the situation and filed a lawsuit under Article 318, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of obstructing freedom. However, due to the need for further investigation, he requested permission to postpone the hearing. After a brief interrogation by Judge Huang Risheng, he ordered them to be returned to custody for further interrogation at a later date. According to the police investigation, Gu Fengshan, also known as Sha Bangcai, is actually a recidivist from Qidong County who has committed many crimes and was wanted by the local security bureau but had not been apprehended.</p>

<p>Huadong News reports that the River Bend Welcoming God Race Meeting, vulgarly called Rolling River Bend, sees no fewer than 100,000 people participating in the parade each year. Due to maintaining order, an idol-burning incident happened. Recently, the merchants and people of River Bend have presented the City Chamber of Commerce to ask it to preside over justice, and to stop paying subsidies to the River Bend Fire Brigade. The citizens are also extremely dissatisfied. There are even those with black armbands to show grief at the idols being destroyed who have been attacked with an axe. Mao Alang, who bangs the head gong, has petitioned the District Court to strictly punish the murderer. The River Bend Fire Brigade has also reported the incident to Police Chief Cai of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reporting the event's progress. Divided in left:</p>
<p>Fire Brigade Report to Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The other day, the River Bend villagers welcomed the God Race Meeting. At 9:00 PM at night, in the middle of the parade, Team Leader Xu Liangzuo and others led the entire team to privately summon the Zhabei 4th District and Wusong Hongzhen fire brigades, to drive vehicles and stop the return to the temple. This morning at 1:30 AM, they moved three deities to the Niulang Temple ground, poured oil on them and burnt them. This action, now that people are still unenlightened, is feared of instigating a change, sincerely advising against it several times to no avail. Committee members were ordered to reorganize, before things had only just improved, in private hearts, things were comforting, unexpectedly there was an accident, this is all that the committee members are not good at supervising. In addition to the details, a separate document presented humbly, President of Committee Diao Qing'en et al kowtow.</p>
<p>Reorganization Committee Proclamation</p>
<p>Shanghai River Bend District Fire Brigade Reorganization Committee Proclamation: Investigation on April 30th at night, this association's team leader, secretary, Vice Team Leader Xu Liangzuo and others, there was idol burning. To smash superstition, there is of course a legitimate and lawful way. The above members did not get permission from this association, acting privately, it is especially inappropriate. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to be reviewed, this hereby publishes a statement, hoping the public will take note.</p>
<p>Citizens Wearing Black Armbands to Note Grief</p>
<p>The common ignorant citizens of River Bend,</p>
<p>Because of three destroyed idols, they show deep pain, and immediately following they wore black armbands together, showing mourning, on the one hand even requesting the idol burners, to refurbish to their former form, the situation is especially severe. After Zhabei Business Association President Wang Binyan persuaded, they ceased the matter. Soon the Zhabei United Fire Brigade, fearing things would increase, has decided to summon the Zhabei segment fire brigades tomorrow to hold a meeting and discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department Strictly Forbids Welcoming God Race Meetings Sends Letter to Municipal Government for Public Order Ban</h3>
<p>This Municipality's City Party Department, taking that the Welcoming God Race Meeting, must not involve superstition, and is instead an effort to move people and waste wealth, now in this promotion of the new life movement, should be strictly forbidden, therefore it has been in two letters to the Municipal Public Security Bureau asking for a ban. Recently Pudong River Bend again has this action happening, Zhabei is even brewing it, if the whole city goes wild then without strict banning, we fear at this point in May with serious social disorder, that petty thieves will take the opportunity to mingle in. Therefore, the City Party Department sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday for a public order ban, and orders the Public Security Bureau to take responsibility for the ban. The original letter is as follows: Direct announcement is as follows: Having investigated Welcoming God Race Meetings, moving people and wasting wealth, bad habits and deteriorating customs, should be prohibited on this grounds. Now the nearby Pudong Welcomed Gods first, then River Bend has a Race Meeting later. Promoting superstition is the most extreme, ruining the new movement, there is nothing more so. The City Party Department has twice written a letter to the Public Security Bureau asking for a ban. Originally it was to smash superstition, make customs beautiful, prevent disorder, to stop conflicts. Unfortunately, the previous letter spoke truthfully. On April 30th River Bend Race Meeting, aroused the general antipathy. As a result, the on-site fire brigade members used the opportunity of maintaining order, and so in the evening after the masses had scattered, they set fire to the wooden figures on display, to root out the superstition, this action was not only to the heart's great joy, and also did not arouse incident, the timing of the treatment was especially appropriate. Having investigated River Bend Liu Shrine Three Sages, names are recorded in the biography. Especially Mr. Liu Pingshan was a great scholar in Song, a famous family for logical study. For the alien races' creeds, he purged them most strongly while alive. By building a shrine here, as people look up and emulate, to take as standard for later generations, this Welcoming God Race Meeting is no less than to take Mr. Liu's evil hatred of things done while he was alive, to add them to his body today, is it not to defile the former sage, is it really against building the shrine to respect his will, local government should take care of the forebearer, correct mistaken beliefs. They in fact let the big shot seduce and fool the masses, so that they can found the basis of a feudal evil force, it is truly regrettable. Shanghai is where the world is looking, the source of cultural promotion, its rumors spread, the whole country follows, now that the New Life Movement is actively progressing, but the Welcoming God Race Meetings, which were prohibited for more than a decade, simultaneously spring up, one advocates, the other harmonizes, the whole city goes mad, can it be that we do not doubt whether foreigners call our New Life Movement so, or even that this matter is such, if Shanghai is like this, will there be others who do not hear of it and rise up? The City Party Department seeing the future of culture and the New Movement, cannot but tremble. Shortly according to reports, the Zhabei Every Heaven Society is again preparing, local hooligans and thugs have been going door to door to swindle money. If it is let go any further, and it is at this time in May with serious disorder, its harms are unpredictable. So it is especially writing this letter to your Government, asking for a quick announcement and a strict order for the Public Security Bureau to take responsibility for the ban. For those who dare to start Welcoming God Race Meeting incidents again, it is immediately to arrest the person in charge, all the disputes caused by the Welcoming God Race Meeting, do not allow debating on who is right and who is wrong, if the person in charge and etcetera is to be questioned, he should be dealt with severely to straighten the morals, then the future of culture and the New Movement will be truly and deeply reliant. Also hoping that your Government will reply on the treatment's state of affairs, to the highest public friendship, this is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Issue 11: Aviation Lottery Results Announced Yesterday</h3>

<p>All Tickets Sold Out: The lottery tickets for this drawing were still sold by the Dayun Company in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Remote provinces were entrusted to local banks for sales or were sold directly by the office. The unsold and returned tickets were negotiated with the All-China Aviation Construction Association, which purchased all of them at face value. Therefore, all lottery tickets were sold this time, avoiding the troublesome procedure of drawing a special prize separately. This will be done similarly in the next drawing. According to committee member Du Yuesheng, the next lottery tickets are now on sale, and the procedures will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Committee Report: At precisely 2:00 PM, after the lottery balls were inspected, committee member Wang Xiaolai announced that the drawing for the eleventh National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was being held there today, and that all procedures had been inspected and completed.

Then the first prize was drawn, being "189207". After the number was announced and broadcasted, the entire venue became tense, as attendees checked the numbers they held. Those who matched the last one or two digits and won eighth or ninth prizes looked joyful. It was reported that the first prize was won in the Beiping-Tianjin area.</p>
<p>Drawing of Seventh Prize: All other prizes were drawn by 4:00 PM. Then the seventh prize was drawn. Representatives present at the venue supervised as the wooden balls were poured into the A copper ball and mixed for several minutes. Then the number "100" was drawn for the seventh prize. All tickets with the last three digits matching this number won the prize. The fact that the number was exactly 100 was considered remarkable by the crowd, who cheered continuously. Other numbers, such as "277772," "232333," and "155555," were also considered quite unique, drawing laughter from the entire venue when reported.</p>
<p>Winning Numbers: The winning numbers for each prize are as follows: First prize (one): "185207"; Second prize (two): "129835" and "349583"; Third prize (four): "112388," "163185," "308536," and "482493"; Fourth prize (ten): "061721," "22016," "126362," "13438," "140741," "185930," "254120," "345149," "351586," and "493611"; Fifth and Sixth prizes (total 150): See the number list; Seventh prize: Last two digits "100"; Eighth prize: Last two digits "07"; Ninth prize: Last digit "7".</p>

<p>Next Issue on Sale: Tickets for the next lottery are now on sale, and the procedures remain the same. The drawing date is scheduled for July 5th at the same location. It has been reported that various lottery ticket vendors in Shanghai have proposed reducing the ticket price and changing the drawing to once a month to facilitate sales. Although the office has adopted the proposal and formulated a plan, it has not been approved by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the procedures for the next few issues will remain unchanged. However, some vendors intentionally raise the ticket price by one or two jiao per set on the morning of the drawing. Those responsible for sales should pay attention to this and stop it.</p>

<h3>First Special District Court Announcement: Strictly Investigate Racketeering and Swindling</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court announces the following: Shanghai is a place where people from all directions gather, and the good and bad are mixed. There are many racketeers and swindlers. When there are lawsuits, they often falsely claim to the parties involved that they have connections with certain officials or prosecutors of the court and can speak on their behalf, or they impersonate court personnel and offer to gather information. They use various excuses to seek money. If they are not successful, they will threaten and intimidate. The parties involved, due to lack of knowledge, are deceived, causing harm to the people's legal rights and the court's reputation, which is extremely regrettable. This court issued Announcement No. 1368 in January of the 22nd year, earnestly informing and reasoning about the situation. For the past two years, the atmosphere has gradually improved. However, we worry that complacency will arise over time. Therefore, we are issuing a new warning. You must know that this court handles cases impartially. Winning or losing a case depends on the evidence and the law. Detention and bail also have certain standards. They cannot be swayed by any influence or favor. If anyone claims that they can intercede with the court, they are intending to extort money. You should report them truthfully or secretly. We will investigate and prosecute them according to the law. This court will also send personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time. If anyone is found to be engaging in racketeering and swindling, they will be severely punished to serve as a warning and to protect the good people. Everyone should be aware of this. Sincerely, this announcement, May 3, 24th year of the Republic of China, President Guo Yunguan, Chief Prosecutor Xiang Zhejunn.</p>
<h3>Postman Steals Stamps Case</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years in Prison</p>
<p>Dong Jianyuan, a Shandong native, 33 years old, residing at 271 Fulili Road, working as a postman, previously served in Harbin. After the Northeast was lost on September 18th, Dong entered the customs and served in post offices in Pingjin and other places. He was recently transferred to Shanghai and assigned as letter carrier No. 807 in the Central 18th District Post Office, specializing in collecting letters from mailboxes on various roads. He has been serving for five or six years, and his salary has increased to 53 yuan per month. However, Dong's expenses were too high, and he could not make ends meet. So, he had a whimsical idea. Recently, he has been hiding dozens of letters collected from mailboxes, tearing off the stamps, selling them for cash, and destroying the letters. This led to senders inquiring and questioning the post office because their letters were not delivered. The post office then sent investigators to conduct a secret investigation. On the afternoon of the 17th of last month, at 3:00 PM, when Dong was collecting letters from a mailbox at the Xujiahui Road Sacred Heart Bridge in the French Concession, he hid the letters by his side. He was spotted by an investigator, who immediately grabbed Dong and found 56 letters in his pocket. He was arrested and taken to the police station. Dong confessed to privately tearing off the stamps and destroying the letters. Investigators were also dispatched to his home, where they seized dozens of letters and sent them to the Second Special Court. The police department filed a public lawsuit against him for embezzlement and theft. The details have been reported previously. Li Changnian, a judge of the Second Special Court, concluded the preliminary hearing. Yesterday, Judge Li opened the court and ordered the defendant to be brought to the court. Dong Jianyuan was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for continuous embezzlement as a warning.</p>
<h3>Haizhou Steamer Collides with Coffin Boat; Coffins Scatter and Drift</h3>
<p>One Corpse is Missing; Crew Member Liu Qi Drowned</p>
<p>Jiangbei boatman Huang Youlan was entrusted by his fellow villagers to transport sixteen coffins back to their hometown for burial. On the afternoon of April 22nd, while sailing through the waters off Sheshan, his boat was suddenly rammed amidships by the Haizhou steamer of the Datong Company. The impact was so severe that Huang's boat was broken into two pieces. Everyone on board fell into the water. Except those who were rescued one after another. However, one crew member, Liu Qi (42 years old), was drowned. When he was retrieved, he was already dead. The sixteen coffins on board were scattered and drifted away. After a lot of searching by other boats, all the coffins were recovered. However, the lid of one coffin was lost, and the body was nowhere to be found. At that time, Huang Youlan simply coffined Liu Qi's body and transported it back to Shanghai. The body was temporarily placed at the Yangjiadu garbage pond in Pudong. Yesterday morning, Huang Youlan reported the situation to the local court and requested an autopsy. After receiving the report, the court dispatched Prosecutor Li Fen and Inspector Xuan Zhiming to Pudong to conduct an autopsy. When the judge arrived at the scene, Huang was not present. The judge ordered the local headman, Yang Zhenqing, to summon a worker to open the coffin. The headman went to find a worker, but due to the time, he could not find one. The judge then ordered the headman to transport the coffin to the Pujiang rescue station on the south pier on the next day (today) for an autopsy. After the judge finished his instructions, he returned to the court.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Woman Chen Fengling Sues Zhu Duanfu for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Requests 20,000 Yuan for Living Expenses and Recovers 1,000 Yuan in Private Savings</p>
<p>Chen Fengling, a 27-year-old woman from Suzhou residing at 8 Peace Lane, Aiwunyi Road, recently retained lawyers such as Zhang Yijun to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special Court against Zhu Duanfu (also known as Zhu Chunqiu), residing at 94 Wuding Road, for malicious abandonment. She is requesting 20,000 yuan in alimony and the return of 1,000 yuan in private savings. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Luo Chongtai came to the Civil Court No. 7 to summon the plaintiff and defendant. Neither party appeared in court, and each retained lawyers to represent them. The plaintiff's agent, Lawyer Zhang, stated that Chen Fengling is currently 27 years old. When she was 17 years old, she met Zhu Duanfu</p>
<p>and began living together.</p>
<p>At that time, the defendant claimed that he was still unmarried. Therefore, they were known as husband and wife both internally and externally. However, after living together, she discovered that the defendant was already married. Because what was done could not be undone, she could only reluctantly become a concubine. For ten years, their relationship was harmonious. Unexpectedly, in July of last year, the defendant met a dancer. As a result, his attitude suddenly changed. First, he used the excuse of investing in stocks to swindle 1,000 yuan from the plaintiff's private savings. Then, their love broke down, and he abandoned her without care. Although the plaintiff and the defendant are not husband and wife, she has been</p>
<p>a concubine.</p>
<p>For ten years now, this spring, he abandoned her because she was older and less attractive. Not only is this unforgivable, but it is also illegal. Furthermore, the plaintiff is weak and ill and has no ability to produce. Her future life will be in a state of desperation. Therefore, she has no choice but to request that the court order the defendant to pay the plaintiff a one-time alimony payment of 20,000 yuan. The defendant inherited his grandfather's estate. In the Chadaijiao area, he owns a lot of land. When the plaintiff and defendant were living together, the defendant gave the plaintiff</p>
<p>200 yuan per month</p>
<p>In addition, he gave her 300 yuan on festivals. Therefore, the plaintiff is now requesting 20,000 yuan for living expenses. The calculation method is to deposit 20,000 yuan in the bank. If she gets one percent interest, she can get 200 yuan per month, which can maintain her life. All of the private savings of 1,000 yuan should be ordered to be returned. The defendant should also bear the litigation costs. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Lu Dingming, argued that the plaintiff used to be a prostitute. In 1926, she was listed at Xiaohuayuan, named Hua Baoyu Laoqi. Later, she was transferred to Fuyuli</p>
<p>Rowland Bookstore.</p>
<p>At that time, because the defendant was still young, he inevitably frequented brothels. He met the plaintiff at that time. At that time, the plaintiff had a patron named Chen, who had the intention of keeping her as a mistress. However, it did not materialize. Because the plaintiff's business was poor, she invited the defendant to help, who frequently spent money on wine and entertainment. In January 1928, the two parties were deeply in love. The plaintiff stopped engaging and rented a house with her stepmother. The defendant went there often and gave her living expenses of 100 yuan, or several tens of yuan, or one hundred and several tens of yuan, depending on his economic ability. There was no such thing as a monthly payment of 200 yuan. Last year, due to the economic downturn, the defendant</p>
<p>was also affected.</p>
<p>His economy was tight. Therefore, he asked the plaintiff to move into his home. Because the plaintiff had other hobbies, he repeatedly advised her to stop. The plaintiff not only refused, but also used vulgar language. As a result, their love broke down, and the defendant stopped going there. This is just a friendship relationship. There is no legal basis. There is no obligation to support her. Therefore, he cannot afford even one yuan. As for the private savings of 1,000 yuan, the plaintiff should be asked to provide evidence. Judge Luo ruled that the case was clear. After the arguments of both lawyers were concluded, he announced that the verdict would be announced at 9:00 AM on the 8th of this month.</p>
<h3>American Palmer Sues Chinese for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Claims Income from Pier Was Appropriated; Court Sends Accountant to Audit Books</p>
<p>American Palmer, manager of the Shishi Foreign Firm at 176 West Shanxi Road, retained Lawyer Lin Luanqing to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against Guangdong natives Chen Wenxiang, Chen Huanzhi, and Cheng Jingchi for business embezzlement, fraudulent financial gain, and breach of trust. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang opened the court for a hearing. The facts are as follows: The plaintiff purchased the Tongtai Pier in Pudong from Dachang Bank in December of the previous year for 75,000 yuan. On June 4th of the following year, he appointed the first defendant, Chen Wenxiang, as the pier manager, Ren Wangzhong as the business manager, and the Xinji Construction Factory was responsible for constructing the necessary buildings and equipment on the pier. Contracts were signed. On October 2nd of the 23rd year, ships began to dock at the pier, and business began. However, the first defendant colluded with his staff, namely the third defendant, Cheng Jingchi, to completely misappropriate all income from the pier. They never reported the income and expense accounts to the plaintiff or the business manager. Wang Zhong privately appointed Chen Tiwu and Jin Youmei as pier brokers, collecting a guarantee deposit of 12,000 yuan. He further appointed Li Haiqing as the gang leader, collecting a guarantee deposit of 5,000 yuan. All of this was pocketed privately, causing the plaintiff's pier office in the Mainland Building on Jiujiang Road to close due to lack of funds. The first defendant is undoubtedly guilty of business embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Code. The second defendant did not personally manage affairs and most often let the third defendant handle everything. Receiving and spending money was the third defendant's important task. The third defendant and the first defendant are suspected of colluding to commit embezzlement, which is also unavoidable. The first defendant falsely established the Yixing store and entered into a gang contract. He further colluded with his father, the second defendant, Chen Huanzhi, using the name of the Fuan Hardware Store to issue bills and pay one bill twice, thereby defrauding money. The first defendant also used receipts from Gu Xinji Construction Factory that were not yet due to deceive the business manager, Wang Zhong, into paying out money for his private use. The crimes under Articles 363 and 1366 of the same law are also obvious. The defendants, knowing they are guilty, have been avoiding capture and have no fixed whereabouts, except for occasional visits to the pier to collect money. They may be planning to flee. In court, each defendant denied the charges when asked. Due to the complexity of the case, an accountant was appointed to audit the books. The hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>City Government Plans to Open Yu Garden; Cui Xiu Tang to Open Automatically</h3>
<p>Vendors Along the Garden to be Banned; Qianye and Tangye Decide After Meetings</p>
<p>The city government's plan to open the Yiyuan Garden in the Yemiao was passed at the last municipal administration meeting. Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau convened three groups: the Doumi Qianye and Tangye, to discuss the opening measures. Now, the Cui Xiu Tang of the rice industry will open automatically. The Qianye and Tangye are scheduled to hold meetings today and tomorrow to decide. The city government will also ban vendors along the garden to improve appearances. The following is a report from the Dagongshe reporter on the various situations:</p>
<p>Banning Vendors to Improve Appearances</p>
<p>The Yilang Yiyuan has always been a famous scenic spot in the city. It originally belonged to the public. The scenery is quiet, and the greenery is lush. The rockeries in the garden are winding and exquisite. Every spring and autumn, birds sing and flowers are fragrant, adding to the pleasant atmosphere. Later, due to indemnity relations, the entire garden was leased to the Qianye Guild, the Doumi Industry's Cui Xiu Tang, and the Tangye's Dianchun Tang, which were divided to establish meeting places with high walls in between. Since then, this scenic area has been unable to be seen. The city government now plans to open the garden for Chinese and foreign people to enjoy. However, the vendors around the garden are cluttered, which hinders the appearance. Therefore, before opening the garden, it has been decided to ban vendors along the route. The banning measures are being discussed by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Cui Xiu Tang to Open Automatically</p>
<p>The Doumi Industry Association's Cui Xiu Tang occupies three-fifths of the Yiyuan and is separated by another wall. Thousands of days are needed each year for the repairs to the houses and rockeries, which are funded by the association. After the city government advocated opening the park, it has been decided through meetings to open it automatically. Visitors will be charged a small fee to pay for repairs. At the same time, the number of visitors per day will be limited to only 300 to 400 people. It is expected to open after the arrangements are completed.</p>
<p>Inner Garden and Dianchun to be Decided at Meetings</p>
<p>At the previous meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau, the Inner Garden of the Qianye Guild and the Dianchun Tang of the Tangye Trade Association stated that the matter concerned the property of the groups and that they would need to hold separate meetings to decide. It is now known that the guild has scheduled a general membership meeting today to decide whether or not to open it.</p>
<h3>National Goods Relief Association Receives Students Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Movement Relief Conference at the Penglai Market, Xiaoximen, has been open for over a week. Due to the sunny weather in recent days, visitors have been enthusiastic. According to the conference's announcement yesterday, over 200,000 visitors have attended in the past week, showing a glimpse of its grand scale. However, most of the visitors are there to see the show. The business in the temporary market has not been very prosperous. According to the conference's statistics, the business volume last week was only slightly over 20,000, which is one-third less than the business volume of previous national goods exhibitions in the Penglai Market. This reflects the downturn in the market amidst the economic recession. The conference's news is as follows:</p>
<p>May Fourth Commemoration</p>
<p>The conference believes that today is the May Fourth Student Movement Commemoration Day. In order to promote the student national goods year and awaken students to use national goods, they have sent letters to schools in the city, asking them to lead students to the conference to visit the national goods. The original letter to the schools is as follows: Respected sirs, This year is the student national goods year, and the day after tomorrow is the May Fourth Student Movement Commemoration Day. This association has ordered this day (all day) to receive students from the city to visit national goods, in order to promote this year and commemorate.

<h3>Zhu Xuefan's Speech on Labor Day (Continued)</h3>
<p>According to central statistical reports, 80% of the national population are illiterate, and the labor community accounts for the majority of the illiterate. To take the recent statistics from a survey of Jiangwan as an example, Jiangwan has a total population of 13,764 people, of which 11,657 are illiterate and only 2,107 are literate. This is a reliable figure. Within this illiterate population, what is the level of knowledge of our farmers and workers? How low is the standard of mass education in China? In today's increasingly serious international situation and the declining national status, how can we talk about saving the country with an illiterate and unknowledgeable populace who do not understand the world situation and the crisis of the nation-state, and who lack a grand vision of the nation-state? If we do not start with transforming them through knowledge and education, then we will fall into empty talk and mere slogans, only able to follow others in shouting slogans. Therefore, the municipal government, the municipal party department, and leaders from all walks of life have seen this and initiated the literacy movement. The first step in the plan is to start with literacy, eliminating illiteracy, especially among the workers who make up the largest illiterate population in the city. Liang Rengong said, "What is education? Education is teaching people how to be human beings, teaching people to be modern people." This means that everyone must be a modern person. In primitive times, when social culture had not been established, everything was barbaric and unreasonable. At that time, not being educated, not reading, and not being literate were not a big deal. But now is not that kind of era anymore. Now is the age of wisdom; the foolish and unknowledgeable will be eliminated and will not be able to survive. Dewey once said, "Education is essential for life. Without education, human life will stop." This means that people who are not educated not only cannot live themselves, but also affect and harm the entire society. Therefore, literacy, continuing education, and receiving education are indeed extremely important, especially in today's China, when saving the country and the nation brook no delay. Can we still be illiterate and unknowledgeable? The Analects say, "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." If we want to revitalize the nation and rejuvenate the country, we must first become literate. Literacy leads to knowledge, knowledge leads to thought, and thought leads to the determination to revitalize the nation. Then we will definitely be able to make the nation-state prosperous and strong. Today is the first day of the Shanghai Literacy Movement Week. I would like to offer three points to the workers of the city and the workers of the country. First, labor literacy. I have already mentioned the importance of labor's status in society and its close relationship with the country. Therefore, labor literacy is certainly the most important task at present. So I hope people in the labor community and people from all walks of life will recognize the importance of labor and support labor literacy. All our fellow workers in Shanghai and the country must also recognize the benefits of literacy. If we want good treatment, improve our lives, raise the status of workers, revitalize the nation, and strengthen the country, we must strive for literacy. Second, labor service. The level of knowledge of Chinese workers is so low that they do not even recognize a single character. How can we achieve the goal of universal literacy? This requires following the labor service methods and spirit of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Those who teach literacy must of course work hard, and those who receive literacy education should study diligently and tirelessly. Many young people say that we work all day long and have no time to study. Those who are older also say that they are too old to study. On the surface, this seems to make sense, but in reality, it is just laziness and complacency. We know that the world is evolving, and each era is different. Even if we cannot run ahead of the times, we should at least keep up with the times. Now is an era of extraordinary struggle. If we do not work hard, we will be eliminated. If we do not work hard, we will not be able to survive. If we spend a little more time to become literate and read, it will not only be of great benefit to the individual, but also benefit the country and society. Therefore, the spirit of labor service is a great force in promoting social progress. Third, labor-capital cooperation. China is now a foolish, poor, and backward country. To make progress, we must first solve poverty. To solve poverty, we must also solve foolishness. In the golden age of the worker movement in 1927, the aim was to attack capitalists and shout slogans to overthrow them. But are there any capitalists in China now? There are not enough to even qualify as capitalists. Many of China's past small capitalists have now been overwhelmed by the imported capitalists of imperialism. China has almost no capitalists, so there is naturally no question of overthrowing them. In order to increase production and revitalize the nation, we must actively implement labor-capital cooperation. In the current situation, if labor and capital do not cooperate, both sides will suffer under the high pressure of imperialism and perish together. We need a comprehensive solution for China. Internally, in terms of production, labor and capital should coordinate and develop national capital. Externally, we should use national capital to resist imperialist capital. Fellow workers of Shanghai, we must break free from our restraints, create an environment, and escape from the dark hell. We must rely on our own strength. If everyone can run forward together, I think China will definitely have a way out. Today is International Labor Day and the first day of the Shanghai Literacy Movement Promotion Week, so I have talked about the past process of the labor movement, the importance of literacy, and the efforts that workers should make today. I hope that everyone can work hard to make 80% of the illiterate literate, thoughtful, capable of struggling, and willing to sacrifice, so that they can save themselves, save society, save the country, and save the nation.</p>
<h3>Huang Yuqi Submits a Petition to the Ministry of Railways Requesting the Restoration of Dining Cars on the Ningbo-Cao'e Railway Line</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Yuqi of the financial community in this city is a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, and is known for his public spirit and concern for society, especially his enthusiasm for his hometown. During his recent trip back to his hometown, Mr. Huang witnessed the hardships of travelers and the embarrassment of merchants on the Ningbo-Cao'e Railway line. Everyone felt that the cancellation of dining cars and the reduction of attendants on the line last year caused great inconvenience to passengers, making it difficult to obtain food and drink and difficult to transport luggage. Those who were helping the elderly and carrying children all had a sense of being lost and helpless. After arriving in his hometown, Mr. Huang also heard comments that the line urgently needed reform and rectification. Therefore, after returning to Shanghai, Mr. Huang, in order to facilitate merchants and travelers, telegraphed the Ministry of Railways and submitted a petition to the two Railway Bureaus, requesting that dining cars be restored and attendants be hired on the Ningbo-Cao'e Railway line as soon as possible. The telegram to the Ministry of Railways reads: (Omitted above) The Ningbo-Cao'e Railway line is an important transportation route for Ningbo and Shaoxing, and a necessary route for gentry and merchants. In the past, there were dining cars to provide meals for passengers and attendants to serve travelers, which was convenient for merchants and made them feel at home when traveling. The level of service was equivalent to that on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways. Unexpectedly, at the end of last year, the line suddenly cancelled dining cars and reduced the number of attendants to only one, which caused great inconvenience to passengers. Not only was there a lack of meals, but even tea and snacks were also difficult to obtain. Travelers from the countryside had to rush to the station from dozens of miles away, and they were bound to be hungry. It was difficult to endure several hours of hunger in the train. If there were restaurants outside the station, they could eat in advance while waiting for the train, but there are no such shops outside the station, which makes people feel hungry. In the past, there were many attendants on the train to serve passengers and perform the duties of cleaning the train. Since the cancellation, only one person has been left. No one can help passengers carry their luggage. The strong can carry it themselves, but the elderly and passengers carrying children cannot bear the heavy burden and are unable to take care of themselves. They are lost and helpless, and their hardships are even greater. As for hygiene, the trains lack cleaning and are difficult to keep clean. Summer has arrived, which is of great concern to hygiene. Even if the attendant is diligent, it is difficult to provide comprehensive service. In short, all of these issues are of vital concern to passengers. Therefore, dining cars and attendants must not be cancelled. Merchants and travelers seek comfort and convenience during their travels, and they are willing to spend a little more money for this. Therefore, I am submitting this telegram to your department, requesting the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau to restore dining cars and hire more attendants on the Ningbo-Cao'e Railway line in order to facilitate merchants and benefit travelers. (Omitted below) The petition to the two Railway Bureaus is the same.</p>
<h3>Wang Xinggao Appeals for an Investigative Hearing</h3>
<p>Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing and the main culprit in the assassination of Dian Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, escaped at the time and remained at large. It was not until the end of last year that the French Concession Police, based on a tip from Zhao Guangfu, who had been apprehended, arrested Wang in Room 513 of the Central Hotel on the evening of December 13. He was sent to the Special Second Court and prosecuted for premeditated murder. After the trial, Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for life. The defendant was dissatisfied with the verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. These details have been reported in the newspapers. At 10:30 AM yesterday, Judge Yue of the High Court's Third Branch opened an investigative hearing and brought Wang to the court for interrogation. According to Wang's statement, he still denied involvement in the murder, repeatedly claiming injustice. He also stated that he was a civil servant and had many enemies. Moreover, at the time of the incident, he was serving in prison in Wuchang, and he did not know Dian Jiapeng, so why would he kill him? He also did not know Zhou Xiaomujiang and others. He only went by the name Wang Xinggao and did not have a second name of Wang Jinkui. He requested an investigation. After the court verified the statement, it ordered Wang to submit his reasons for appeal as soon as possible and wait for a scheduled retrial. After the discussion, Wang was ordered to be returned to the detention center to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>No Bids for Shun'an Steamer; Creditors Jointly Agree to Maintain</h3>
<p>The Shun'an steamer of the Shun'an Company was involved in a lawsuit due to the incident in which the shipowner Ouyang Tai attempted to blow it up, but later had a change of heart and did not carry out the attack. Details of the incident have been reported in the previous news. It is now learned that the company has been severely affected by this incident, and the ship has been detained and docked in the Longhua Pudong. The creditors have successively hired lawyers such as Lin Luanqing and Gan Lin to sue the local court for repayment of debts and requested that the ship be sold to offset the debts. Creditors such as China United Assurance Company are suing for 20,122 yuan in foreign currency, Jiangnan Shipbuilding Plant for 6,500 yuan, Kang Zhenkui for 1,025 yuan and 35 yuan, Hengli Bank for 6,000 yuan, Yitai Coal Company for 1,400 yuan, Yichang Hardware Company for 3,277 yuan, and Jia Hua Bank for 1,000 yuan. After investigation and judgment, the Shun'an steamer was put up for auction, but no one made an offer. This is now the third auction, and the minimum price is 40,896 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhu Yinqiao of the Enforcement Court opened the hearing. Lawyers Lin Luanqing and Gan Lin appeared in court and stated that if the ship remains unsold for a long time, they are deeply concerned that further delays will cause damage to the ship's machinery. They urged that a solution be found as soon as possible. After verifying the statements, the judge instructed all creditors to discuss joint maintenance measures to avoid losing their principal. Lawyers Lin and others replied that they would consult and report back later.</p>

<p>Dagong News reports that the Cigarette Smuggling Suppression Association, organized by the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Cigarette Association, has established a public warehouse to store cigarette paper required by the city and strictly prevent tax evasion due to the prevalence of tax-evading cigarette paper in Shanghai. It is learned that the cigarette public warehouse, which has been prepared for many years by the Tax Bureau, has been established. The warehouse is located in Tilanqiao, with four floors and adjacent to the Huangpu River, making loading and unloading extremely convenient. The Tax Bureau stipulates that all cigarette paper purchased by merchants in the city must be stored in the public warehouse.

<h3>Standard Milk Sales are Booming</h3>
<p>Endorsed by Dr. Wu Liande and Many Renowned Doctors</p>
<p>Standard Milk is a product of China Standard Milk Bean Milk Company. The company was established by Shanghai Chinese and Western gentry and merchants, including Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, Ding Wenjiang, Wang Zimin, Tang Shoumin, Wu Yun Chu, Lamb, Bode, and Xue Shi, with a share capital of over 200,000 yuan. Its main products are Standard Milk, Bean Milk Substitute Powder, and Frozen Custard. Standard Milk is a scientifically modified milk that is very similar in nature to human milk and is currently popular in Europe and the United States. It is especially popular in Southeast Asia. Bean Milk Substitute Powder is the latest invention of scientists, rich in nutrition and convenient to take. The selling price is only about 20% of ordinary milk substitutes. Frozen Custard is only made by the American Hai Ning Foreign Company in Shanghai for many years. Since the "Beauty Brand" is in short supply, the company specially produces "White Rose Brand" frozen custard to meet the needs of the community. Currently, Standard Milk has already begun operations, and Bean Milk Substitute Powder and White Rose Brand Frozen Custard will also be launched this month. The company guarantees that the milk fat content in Standard Milk will be 4.5% in all bottles throughout the year. The vitamin content is also very high. It has obtained a special license from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement. The Municipal Council manages it by citing the A-grade milk regulations. Since its launch just a month ago, daily sales have reached more than 1,000 pounds. In the beginning, most consumers were foreigners. Since the endorsement of famous doctors in Shanghai and the publication of promotional comments by Dr. Wu Liande after personally visiting the factory, it has gradually been trusted by the ladies of Shanghai. In particular, after the company announced the characteristics of Standard Milk and its modification details in newspapers, it gained the confidence of the intellectual class. Recently, more than one hundred new households have been added every day, and the company is struggling to keep up with demand. The previous doubts about freshness and rumors about the lack of milk fat have been dispelled. According to the person in charge of the company, the reason for achieving unexpected success in such a short period of time is not only thanks to the promotion efforts of the medical community, but also to the social circles appreciation for quality goods. The superiority of Standard Milk lies not only in its quality exceeding the Municipal Council's A-grade milk regulations, but also in its particularly fair selling price. A half-pound small bottle is sold for only 15 cents, a one-pound medium bottle for 28 cents, and a two-pound large bottle for 50 cents. The company's business location is at No. 60, Nanxun Road, telephone number 40080. You can place orders by phone or mail at any time from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM every day.</p>
<h3>Xue Mingjian Petitions the Construction Department to Promote Rabbit Farming</h3>
<p>The Department Orders the Wuxi Extension Office to Conduct a Pilot Program</p>
<p>Xin Xin News reports that Xue Mingjian, a member of the business community, submitted a petition to the Construction Department the day before yesterday to promote rabbit farming. The original petition stated: "The petition is to request that the agricultural extension offices in all counties be ordered to promote rabbit farming to relieve the rural economy. The rural economy of Jiangsu Province has traditionally relied on silk as a major source of income. Since the failure of mulberry cultivation, the rural economy has frequently gone bankrupt. Without a replacement, it will be difficult to recover. It is believed that rabbit farming is the most suitable for rural breeding in our country. Japan has promoted it throughout the country for the past five or six years. The benefits obtained have surpassed chicken and bee farming, and will be on par with silk. I implore you to order the Wuxi Agricultural Extension Office to allocate special funds to cultivate rabbit breeds or to set up a rabbit breeding farm, stipulating that it will be popularized throughout the county within two years in order to recover the 24 million yuan loss from silk farming. Then extend it to the other sixty counties in the province, so that farmers throughout the province can maintain their livelihoods. Attached is an article of sixty-five pages on how to recover from the failure of silk farming in Wuxi, which shows a glimpse. Separately, the humble compilation "Practical Rabbit Farming Method" will be sent separately after printing is completed. I implore you to quickly allocate special funds and implement promotion for the benefit of the rural area." Yesterday, the Construction Department's response was received, stating that the proposal to promote rabbit farming to relieve the rural economy is insightful. The provincial silk trial farm should be ordered to conduct a pilot program at the original site of the Wuxi County Extension Office. It can be promoted after the success is achieved. This is the reply.</p>
<h3>City Sounds</h3>

He hailed Vimo as a rare and exceptional expert in physiognomy, personally writing an inscription, signing his name, and affixing his seal to introduce him. Consequently, those who sought his services were all intellectuals. As the market was too depressed, Vimo had decided to depart for Hong Kong within a week. It was said that his fee, originally one dollar and twenty cents, would be reduced to sixty cents from today onward as a farewell memento.

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Shandong and its surrounding areas are cloudy, turning overcast, with rain. The wind direction is uncertain, due to a low-pressure area in Henan. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are cloudy, but still clear and fine, with localized fog and gentle southeast to southwest winds. The East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait are overcast, with strong northeasterly breezes. A small hurricane northwest-west of Yap Island appears to be still moving northwest-west. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 72.1 degrees and the lowest was 49.8 degrees.

<p>Total 38,572 100.00</p>
<p>From the above observations, one can get a glimpse of the advances made by the Bank in industrial and commercial investment over the past year. Among them, the development of merchandise mortgages and remittances is particularly noteworthy. In the past, merchants and people in the interior placed great emphasis on credit. They considered mortgage loans and remittances to be cumbersome procedures, and banks also felt that their facilities were inadequate, so many simply gave up or even chose to make do. This year, the Bank has established a number of institutions in the interior and has striven to improve warehouse facilities. The railways have also resumed responsible joint transportation, which has facilitated communication and opened up the atmosphere. As a result, merchants and people have gradually gained an understanding of the Bank's practices, and this achievement has been obtained. In the future, the Bank should continue to follow this principle and continue to promote it in order to achieve thoroughness. As for securities investment, there have been changes in business policies in recent years, and it should be reduced as much as possible in order to free up a portion of funds for operations in the production sector. Therefore, the balance for this year has decreased compared to the twenty-second year. However, at the same time, due to the need to offset various reserve requirements, it is still necessary to maintain a considerable amount. (3) Remittances: The total amount of remittances made by the Bank in the twenty-third year was 291,042,000 yuan, an increase of 80,418,000 yuan compared to the twenty-second year and an increase of 99,068,000 yuan compared to the twenty-first year. The total amount of bills purchased was 177,677,000 yuan, an increase of 71,457,000 yuan compared to the twenty-second year and an increase of 93,391,000 yuan compared to the twenty-first year.

<h3>Announcement to Citizens</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>Dear Compatriots:</p>
<p>You probably all know the pain of being illiterate. An illiterate person cannot keep accounts, write letters, read newspapers, understand posters on the walls, understand official notices, or understand world affairs. Sometimes, it is simply having eyes but being blind, becoming a "bright-eyed blind person." Their suffering is truly indescribable.</p>
<p>In our China, about eighty out of every hundred people are illiterate. Shanghai also has hundreds of thousands of illiterate people. To relieve the suffering of the people and revitalize our nation, we must first make all these illiterate people literate. To this end, we will begin a large-scale literacy education movement starting from July 1st of this year. We plan to give hundreds of thousands of illiterate men, women, old and young in Shanghai the opportunity to become literate within one year, and also provide them with some general knowledge, guidance, and civic training, so that they all become healthy citizens.</p>
<p>The methods we will use are: First, divide Shanghai into twenty-two districts, with sixty literacy classes established in each district, for a total of one thousand three hundred and twenty literacy classes in the city. We will compel illiterate people to attend classes for one hour a day. Not only will there be no tuition fees, but we will also provide books. They can graduate after studying for two months. Second, for those who really cannot go to school every day, we will send teachers to their homes to provide individual guidance. After two months, if they pass our exams, we can also give them graduation certificates. By that time, they will be able to keep accounts, write letters, and read simple newspapers. Not only will it be convenient for themselves, but all of us in Shanghai will feel very proud. If someone does not cherish themselves and does not want to become literate, then we will definitely give them appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>However, without an investigation, our methods cannot be implemented. Because we do not yet know who is illiterate, how many illiterate people there are, who can attend school in the morning, who can attend school in the evening, and who really cannot attend school. How can we run schools and send teachers? Therefore, the Jiangwan Experimental District has been dispatching a large number of investigators since April 10th, the Nanshi Experimental District has been doing so since May 1st, and the other twenty districts will be doing so from May 10th, carrying identification documents to conduct on-the-ground investigations of illiterate people and also persuade them to go to school.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this literacy education movement is clearly a very heavy and difficult task. We have few people and limited ability, so we cannot help but hope that all sectors of society will provide more support. China is fortunate!</p>
<h3>Literacy Education All-Out Mobilization</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Citizens of the Republic of China, our compatriots, more than 70 percent are illiterate, meaning that more than 300 million citizens are illiterate. Even though the citizens of Shanghai are more enlightened than those in the interior, I am afraid that the total number of illiterate people, young and old, including those in the concessions, will reach about 1.5 million. In modern civilized countries, literate citizens account for at least 70 percent of the total population, and in many cases, they can reach more than 90 percent. Our country pales in comparison, and no wonder the national situation has declined to this point! Now, the slogan of "national rejuvenation" is filling the country, but if we do not start with universal education—literacy is the first step in universal education—everything will be empty talk. Therefore, the central government has stipulated seven movements, with the literacy movement ranking first.</p>
<p>The importance of universal literacy education need not be belabored. Now that the work of literacy education in Shanghai has begun, I dare to express my sincere hope to all citizens of Shanghai in twelve thousandths of a sincerity: "Literacy Education All-Out Mobilization." The so-called "mobilization" means that from the commander-in-chief, commanders of all routes, staff officers, brigade commanders, battalion commanders, and down to platoon leaders and brothers, all go to the front line to prepare for a desperate battle. The people in the rear, those who work, those who transport, those who provide medical assistance, also do their best to support the war. Only then is "all-out mobilization" worthy of the name. We must also unite the full power of the government and the people in the work of literacy education to fight a desperate battle against the phenomenon of "illiteracy" and a desperate battle against the root of "ignorance." Only with determination and unwavering resolve can we have hope of success.</p>
<p>Therefore, the work during the literacy education propaganda period is equivalent to the propaganda work during the period when the United States joined the European War seventeen or eighteen years ago, and also equivalent to the propaganda work during the period when Japan fought against Russia thirty years ago, and even more equivalent to the propaganda work of training people for air defense and self-defense in various countries around the world now. We must take the city's education sector as the main force, the city's industrial and commercial sectors as a joint army fighting together, and the city's party members and civil servants as the driving force, mobilizing all citizens who have received education and are capable of teaching others to read, to serve for literacy education under the command of the Literacy Education Committee and in accordance with all the regulations promulgated. Assuming that the literacy schools run by the municipal government are the frontal army, then the literacy schools run by individual citizens or groups are no different from the left and right wings of the army, and all other service groups, mutual aid groups, work-study groups, cultural cells, little teachers, etc., are no different from commando teams that are ever-changing and capable of winning by surprise. All of us who have received education, regardless of the level of education or the depth of knowledge, should clearly recognize that if there are still illiterate people in the city after one or two years, it is our shame and our failure. At the same time, we should work diligently and practically, build strongholds, and fight to the death, and we must achieve the goal of eliminating all illiteracy in the city. If citizens who are capable of teaching others to read, regardless of party, government, academia, industry, commerce, freelancers, or even entertainers and rural scholars, can truly mobilize as a whole and launch a general attack on the phenomena of "illiteracy" and "ignorance," I believe that the approximately 1.5 million illiterate people in the city will be transformed into literate citizens in the shortest possible time. I hope that knowledgeable citizens and citizens who can teach others to read will join the "literacy education army" and mobilize to the front line!</p>
<h3>Eradicating Illiteracy</h3>
<p>— Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>Eradicating illiteracy is a prerequisite for nation-building in every modern country. Whether it is the Soviet Union or Turkey, before the revolution, the literacy rate and the cultural level of their citizens were very low. After the revolution, their governments and people used all their strength to eradicate illiteracy. The current Soviet Union and Turkey have not only been transformed in various aspects such as politics and economy, but the general cultural level of the citizens has also improved, making it impossible to compare with before the revolution.</p>
<p>The improvement of a country's national cultural level cannot be said to be 100% based on the literacy level of the people, but it can be said that 90% of it is improved along with the improvement of literacy level. Writing is originally a master key to the treasure house of culture. Eradicating illiteracy allows all citizens to recognize and apply basic writing. The dissemination of culture naturally becomes easier, and the general cultural level of the citizens naturally improves.</p>
<p>There are no accurate statistics on the number of illiterate people in China. According to general estimates, it is about 80% or more. These 80% or more of people are not only unable to write letters, keep accounts, read newspapers, read posters, or read announcements, but also lack the necessary common knowledge about nature, society, the country, and the nation. The low level of national culture is simply impossible to find a second example of in modern civilized countries. This is truly a "national shame" of the first order. Everyone thinks about it. Such a country is really "not qualified." How can it survive in the current world? Therefore, if we want to revitalize the nation, build the country, and create culture, the first step must be to vigorously promote literacy education and eradicate illiteracy.</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's first major city, and also one of the world's top six cities. The cultural level of the general public is naturally higher than in other places. However, according to surveys and statistics, even in the urban area alone, excluding out-of-school children, there are still five to six hundred thousand illiterate citizens. Now that we are implementing literacy education, we must follow the planned plan and turn these five to six hundred thousand illiterate people into citizens who can recognize and apply basic writing within one year. This will set off a trend across the country, eradicate illiteracy, raise the cultural level, and wash away this rare "national shame." Only in this way can we talk about revitalizing the nation, building the country, and creating culture! Only in this way can we survive in the current world!</p>
<h3>What is the Purpose of Literacy Education?</h3>
<p>— Wu Xingya</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Committee has this time set down very detailed methods and made the greatest determination to promote literacy education, hoping to eliminate illiteracy within the urban area of Shanghai within one year.</p>
<p>After the illiteracy in Shanghai is eliminated, will the so-called blind people with open eyes see the light again, and will this be considered that the purpose of literacy education has been achieved? No, absolutely not. If illiterate people can all become literate, can keep track of their petty expenses, can write their own names, can read advertisements in newspapers, and can understand announcements from government offices, will this be considered that the purpose of literacy education has been achieved? This not only belittles the greatness of the literacy education movement, but also desecrates the dignity of the literacy education movement.</p>
<p>Originally, literacy education is by no means simply teaching people to read. In addition to literacy, there are two more important tasks: general knowledge guidance and civic training. Therefore, general knowledge guidance and civic training are the purpose of literacy education. Recognizing writing is just a method to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p>Of course, without first becoming literate, the two tasks of general knowledge guidance and civic training cannot be implemented. Therefore, the order of the literacy education movement is that writing education comes first, and general knowledge guidance and civic training come later. However, this distinction between before and after is by no means a distinction between importance. I believe that the strength and time required for general knowledge guidance and civic training should be greater and longer than that required for writing education in order to complete the mission of the literacy education movement.</p>
<p>As for how to guide general knowledge and how to train citizens, this matter is of great importance and requires careful thought. Of course, the Literacy Education Committee must unite educators, writers, and the publishing industry to work hard on this. Today (April 19th), I read a piece of news in the newspaper that can be provided to us as a reference for engaging in literacy education.</p>
<p>This piece of news is an electrical report from Berlin on April 28th, reporting that Germany will announce a citizenship law this year. Its Minister of the Interior said to people: Only those who serve the people and the country and prove their ability can obtain the honor of citizenship. Only citizens can be subject to public office, join the army, and have the right to vote. All those who receive citizenship must swear allegiance to the country and the head of state. Those who are lowly and enemies of the country will be deprived of their citizenship. He also quoted Hitler as saying: Only those whose parents are both of the Germanic race can be Germans and can be German citizens. Their bodies must be strong, their character must be pure, and they must be granted citizenship after completing their military service.</p>
<p>The citizenship law that Germany is about to promulgate has several characteristics, namely: German citizens must have strong bodies and pure character; they must serve in the military, obey discipline, and be loyal to the country and the head of state. I believe that anyone who understands the current situation in China and the general situation in the world, especially those of us who engage in the literacy education movement with the purpose of general knowledge guidance and civic training, should pay close attention to these points.</p>
<h3>The Literacy Education Movement and the Police</h3>
<p>— Cai Jinjun</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been established for twenty-four years, but it has not yet been able to become strong. Although there are many reasons for this, the most important is that the people are not enlightened and there are very few literate people. Therefore, the government's orders are mostly unknown to the majority of the people. Therefore, many obstacles have arisen in the implementation of government orders. How can a country not be weak if its government orders cannot be implemented among the majority of the people! Therefore, for the sake of saving the country and revitalizing the nation, Chairman Chiang believes that the work of promoting literacy education must be done first, completely abolishing the more than 80% of illiterate people in the country, and ensuring that all Chinese people can know how to write and read. Therefore, he recently issued a general order to the whole country to work together to abolish illiteracy. The central government has also decided that the central task for this year is to abolish illiteracy throughout the country. Mayor Wu has decided to start implementing literacy education in Shanghai on May 1st of this year, which has more meticulously and completely stipulated the implementation plan and supervision methods for us. Now, our only responsibility is to implement it on schedule according to the plan. Because the success or failure of this movement is very important to the strength or weakness of the country. The police represent the country in implementing all government orders, not only protecting the lives and property of the people and maintaining the peace and order of the country and society, but also actively assisting the development of all beneficial undertakings for the people, so as to achieve the most perfect state. Therefore, the police bear a major responsibility for this literacy education movement. I am now standing in the position of the police and offering three points of opinion as follows:</p>
<p>First, when starting the work of investigating the exact number of literate and illiterate people in the city, I sincerely hope that the leaders of all circles in the city and the general literate gentlemen will earnestly cooperate with our police and do their best to assist the illiterate people, indicating to them the methods and procedures for entering school and the important significance of the literacy education movement, so as to ensure that the investigation work and persuasion and propaganda achieve universal and broad effects in the shortest prescribed time.</p>
<p>Second, when we promote literacy education, we must follow a detailed plan, a complete plan, and formulate a daily literacy education schedule, earnestly implement it, and be meticulous in every detail, so as to make the effectiveness of the work better and better, and strive for perfection.</p>
<p>Third, we must be responsible for mutual supervision and assessment. Those who can fulfill their responsibilities, we encourage him and hope that he will fulfill his responsibilities even more. Those who do not fulfill their responsibilities, we must urge him to fulfill his responsibilities. If one urging does not listen, then urge again. If urging again does not listen, then urge three times, always demanding that the work of literacy education achieve the final goal in accordance with the prescribed plan. If it is really incorrigible and hopeless, we will very unceremoniously announce his name so that everyone knows. Because if there are really such shameless and bad elements in the group of human beings, not giving them appropriate punishment is not upholding justice. Therefore, in order to uphold justice, we must punish these negligent elements.</p>
<p>I believe that the above three points of opinion, although humble and without high opinions, feel practical. I hope that the leaders of all circles in the city, the general intellectuals, and all citizens will unanimously show the greatest determination and persevering perseverance to realize the central government's resolution on literacy education, Chairman Chiang's general order to promote literacy education, and the mayor's plan to implement literacy education under the leadership of our Mayor Wu, so as to ensure that all the people of this city can fully write and read in the shortest possible time, which is the foundation for saving the country and revitalizing the nation.</p>
<h3>A Review and Prospect of Literacy Education</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianbai</p>
<p>The Attributes of Literacy Education: Some people ask whether the term "literacy education" is frequently heard. Regarding literacy as a category of education is considered inappropriate. Therefore, its attributes must be explained. Generally, formal schools such as primary schools, middle schools, and universities are considered education. A broader meaning includes social and cultural institutions, libraries, museums, etc., as education. In fact, according to a broad interpretation, all human activities and various forms of life are education and have educational value. Moreover, writing is a tool for recording human experience. How to read, how to understand the meaning of words, is undoubtedly an important form of education. Literacy is not just about recognizing the sound of words; the meaning of all words and the sentences formed by words are necessary processes in teaching. Therefore, literacy education includes common sense training, civic training, and the principles of being a person and doing things. Literacy education is the basic education of citizens, the initial literacy and education, and a part of what is called compulsory education. Therefore, in terms of the responsibility of the people, it is an obligation. In terms of national policy, it is compulsory. Literacy education is a comprehensive education that combines adult remedial education and children's compulsory education.</p>
<p>The Failures of Literacy Education: In the late Qing Dynasty, few people paid attention to literacy education. After the founding of the Republic of China, social figures gradually paid attention to it, either advocating the use of simplified characters or planning to use phonetic alphabets as tools for promoting literacy. The venues were either open-air schools, simplified character schools, public tutorial schools, or half-day schools, etc., as institutions for implementing literacy. At that time, it was difficult to achieve significant results due to the efforts of only a few people. However, the government did not have a concrete plan for the illiterate people of the former Qing Dynasty, so the effect was minimal. The concrete attention to the literacy movement and the start of publicity was the promulgation of the Outline of the Literacy Movement Propaganda Plan in 1929. The central government listed literacy as the top of the seven movements in the autonomous movement of the lower-level work of the Party at all levels, which also shows its special attention. In 1930, the Ministry of Education formulated and implemented a remedial education plan based on the resolution of the Second National Education Conference, which included literacy training and civic training, using the least amount of money and the shortest amount of time to enable the general public to read and write and have the ability to exercise their four rights. It is found that about 80% of the people in the country are illiterate. Assuming the national population is 436,094,953 people, a total of 348,875,962 people are illiterate. If those aged 16 to 60 who should receive remedial education account for about 46.5%, totaling 202,784,153 people, accounting for nearly half of the total population, plus about 60 million children who are out of school, totaling 280 million people who need to receive the minimum level of literacy education. Although the government has set various plans, due to the lack of funding and talent, and the implementers' ingrained habit of fearing difficulties and seeking ease, the huge number of out-of-school people remain as they were. With such a knowledge-lagging, rudimentary level of citizens, how can we expect to save the country from its declining danger!</p>
<p>The Conditions for the Success of Literacy Education: Literacy education is a major "task," and the responsibility for this major task still lies with "people." The reason why literacy education has not been successful in the past is "not that it cannot be done, but that it is not done." The reasons for not doing it are: first, there is a lack of mental construction, thinking that knowing is difficult and acting is not easy, so they sit and do nothing; second, there is a lack of self-confidence. Intellectuals often cannot believe how much ability they have. They are self-deprecating and decadent, how can they take on the responsibility of teaching people; third, there is a lack of practical spirit. People generally talk big and boast, but when they are really asked to do it practically, they cannot do it. This can also be said to be the failure of the essence of education in the past. Fourth, they do not pay attention to methods. Doing something is the goal. To achieve this goal, methods must be studied. Moreover, the complex and changing human environment is not immutable. Teaching illiterate people is several times more difficult than teaching in any formal school. If you don't think of ways from the psychological, environmental, and factual aspects, and say that it can't be done when you encounter failure, how can you succeed? Shanghai is a place with potential. During this period when literacy education is transformed from movement to implementation, everyone should be mindful of the man-made failures of the past where it was not that they could not do it, reflect on themselves, find the reasons within themselves, and not repeat the same mistakes. Therefore, success or failure depends on "people," so that everyone can work hard.</p>
<p>Post-literacy Education after the Initial Completion of Literacy Education: The increase in teaching experience lies in generalization and review. This literacy education is only the initial stage of popular education, which is far from the expected level of popularization. Therefore, after the completion of the entire first phase, there should be an entire second phase plan to continue implementation. After the completion of each phase of this plan (that is, after each phase of graduation), there should be itemized and categorized educational facilities, such as adding allusions to the words and texts that have been taught, and compiling popular picture publications, holding popular lectures and gatherings, and setting up literacy or question-asking places, all of which are indispensable work for generalization and practice. The former should still be handled by the government in a comprehensive manner, and the latter has to hope that the society will cooperate to promote it, so that the literacy education work can achieve practical results.</p>
<h3>Review and Outlook of the Association's Work</h3>
<p>— Tao Baichuan</p>
<p>This association was established on April 1, but officially started working on April 6. If we divide the periods based on important work as a standard, then April can be said to be the planning period, May and June can be said to be the preparation period, and after July can be said to be the implementation period.</p>
<p>As the Western saying goes, "A good beginning is half the battle." The importance of planning is certainly no less than preparation and implementation. Therefore, the work of the past twenty-odd days has almost exhausted our brains. Moreover, the large-scale promotion of literacy education is not only a pioneering work in Shanghai, but also in China. It is said to be unprecedented and with followers - because there is no precedent, we have nothing to learn from; because there are followers, we dare not be hasty, lest our failure shut the door to literacy education.</p>
<p>After twenty-odd days of hard work, we have finally established the entire plan. In terms of organization, we have established two systems: one is the general office of this association, with 22 district offices and 220 literacy schools and their 1,320 literacy classes; the other is the literacy education service team, with 300 sub-teams preparing to recruit 10,000 members as a supplement to the literacy schools. In terms of publicity, we have planned a publicity week, which is now actively underway. In terms of investigation, we are preparing to mobilize all the local police, household registration police, the education that has been admitted to the literacy school, and the older students from public and private schools in each district, to give full play to the spirit of labor service, and conduct a large-scale investigation of the illiterate people in the city. In addition, in order to test our ideals, we have set up two experimental districts, and now there are ten schools that can enroll students and start classes. The budget has also been prepared, with a total of about 170,000 yuan, of which the teachers' salaries and clothing expenses are estimated at about 110,000 yuan. The teaching materials are edited by ourselves. The content includes literacy education, common sense guidance, and civic training. The printing cost is very cheap, averaging only one cent and two and a half mils per volume.</p>
<p>The most important work during the preparation period is to investigate the illiterate people, followed by training teachers, followed by publicity, followed by enrollment and preparation for the start of school, and the completion of the literacy education service team is also one of the important tasks. The publicity has started on May 1 and will end on the 7th, but publicity among the people will still need to be continued in the future. The investigation work must be completed in three weeks, and will begin on May 14. The investigation committee in each district will be responsible for handling it. Based on the experience of the Jiangwan experimental district, the future results will be very impressive. Teacher training will be held after the completion of the investigation, and the time will be about three weeks. After the training, the teachers will be sent to each district to prepare for the start of school.</p>
<p>By July 1, most of the literacy schools in each district can start classes, and the members of the literacy education service team can also start looking for illiterate people to provide individual teaching, and the leaders of the sub-teams will be responsible for the collective training of the people; the work of this association will thus move from the preparation period to the implementation period.</p>
<h3>The Central Mission of Literacy Education</h3>
<p>— Chen Gongsu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Now is a world where intelligence is competing: the strength of a country's national power is directly proportional to the number of literate people in it. We can say that there is no strong country with few literate people, and in weak countries, education is always not universal, and the number of literate people is certainly small, because writing is the most important tool for acquiring knowledge. Those who recognize writing can use its power to seek knowledge and enrich the content of their lives. Those who do not recognize writing lose a way to knowledge, cannot get the development they deserve, and reduce the country's strength.</p>
<p>Our China, in terms of its vast territory, large population, and abundant products, should have dominated the world and led the nations. However, due to the harm of the foolish people policy and bureaucratic education for thousands of years, most people think that reading and writing is only a right and obligation that a few people should have. Therefore, the number of illiterate people in society is very alarming! It is estimated that the number of literate people in our China accounts for only 20%, and the remaining 80% or more are ignorant people who do not recognize writing. In this situation, the lives of many individuals, in fact, add infinite difficulties, and society is not easy to improve as a result. As a result, China has become a large but not strong country, suffering humiliation, not getting equality, and not being free!</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want equality and freedom for the country and the nation, we must seek to improve the knowledge of the people, so we must use rapid methods to carry out the movement to eliminate illiteracy. Now the city has decided to implement compulsory literacy education from July 3 this year, which is undoubtedly the most practical work to save the country. All citizens must do their best to promote its success.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Citizens have the responsibility to promote compulsory literacy education in the city to achieve the expected goals. The principle is clear. Therefore, in addition to the literacy education committee and educational administrative organs that are responsible for statistics, whether they are civil servants, freelance professionals, educators, all intellectuals, and various public groups, such as various general chambers of commerce, trade unions, associations, educational institutions, etc., really have a responsibility to assist the government in carrying out literacy education. Regarding the specific methods, they can either join the service team, or run their own literacy schools, or donate money and materials to run literacy schools. What is needed is that everyone recognizes the urgent need for this work and the responsibility that they should fulfill for this work and can do it practically.</p>
<p>We know that among the 80% or more of the Chinese people who are illiterate, farmers and workers account for the majority. Therefore, the target of literacy education is naturally the most important for farmers and workers. Based on this reason, we cannot but hope that there will be ample opportunities to implement literacy education in rural areas and factories. When we contribute our intelligence and financial resources, we must pay attention to this. We believe that in factories, trade unions and factories should jointly run it to achieve the effect of cooperation. If the area where the industry association is located is a commercial area and it is not easy to recruit students, it can contribute money to entrust the literacy education committee to establish schools on its behalf, and the name of the literacy school can be determined by the industry association that contributed the money. And each district's farmers' association and education association should at least set up one literacy school. The above is our general method of assisting the government. We can only make this great movement achieve twice the result with half the effort if we pool our efforts and cooperate fully.</p>
<p>However, what we want to mention here is the psychological construction of literacy education. As the saying goes: without knowing people, it is difficult to take a step; without knowing words, the world can be traveled. Although this is a popular view, its influence is enough to make ordinary people reduce their belief in literacy. Moreover, many people in society think that people like Ye Chengzhong and Yang Sicheng did not know words at first, and were able to achieve considerable success in society. They did not know that people like Ye and Yang had higher aspirations and perseverance than others. If they did not recognize words and had more knowledge, their success would have been even greater. Some people thought that since illiteracy can lead to fame, then whether or not literacy is important! Therefore, we must break this wrong concept in the publicity and persuasion of literacy education!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Speaking of the content of literacy education, it includes three parts: literacy education, common sense guidance, and civic training. The literacy education part includes the teaching of 600 words. These words are naturally not enough for the needs of life, and can only be said to be better than nothing. The imparting of common sense and the training of citizens are especially important. From a personal point of view, the central mission of literacy education can be said to be actually placed on civic training.</p>
<p>Our literacy movement is a movement to save the country. The reason why we want the people to be literate is to enable them to understand the great principles of saving the country, and then implement the "effective" work. Writing is just a tool for seeking knowledge. Our purpose is to let the people use this tool to obtain common sense of life, so as to increase their personal happiness. More importantly, they should receive civic training, understand the status of the country and the nation, understand the mission of our party, and understand the meaning of the Three Principles of the People, so as to take on the responsibility of the national revolution. Understanding this, then literacy education can give full play to its supreme role and have its supreme value.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>In summary, we can know the importance of literacy education, our responsibilities and methods of assisting the government in carrying out literacy education, and the central mission of literacy education. At this eve of the First World War, our Chinese nation, which has a glorious culture, does not seek the continuation of its life. If we still intend to survive in the future, can we still follow the old ways and make mistakes, and not quickly wake up the people, strive to struggle and fight, in order to save the crisis of weak nations? Literacy education is a kind of work to awaken the people. I hope that comrades and compatriots who are determined to save the country will unite to complete this work, tightly grasp reality, so as to maintain the glory of the past and open up the bright future.</p>
<h3>The Employer's Responsibility to Promote Literacy Education</h3>
<p>— Ma Chonggan</p>
<p>Shanghai will eliminate illiteracy in the city from July 1. Implement compulsory literacy education for one year. Its significance is not a simple literacy education, but a national salvation movement that combines common sense guidance and civic training. All citizens should support it with all their strength.</p>
<p>The methods for promoting literacy education have long been detailed. If they can be handled in order, good results will be achieved. Now, based on what I have seen, I will put forward one thing for reference.</p>
<p>It is found that there are many apprentices and clerks in the city's shops and factories, and servants in families who are illiterate, or who know a little bit, but have not learned 700 or 800 words and have no common sense of citizenship. These people should receive literacy education. The managers of shops and factories and the masters of families should order them to enter literacy schools during their work breaks, or if it is inconvenient to enter school, the shops and factories can choose outstanding employees to serve as members of the literacy education service team and teach them at appropriate times. The servants in the family can be teachers by the master or children. Do not say that employees spend an hour a day learning to read and write and are afraid of hindering work, and do not let them receive the minimum level of education. Often know that after the workers are literate, they will deeply understand the great meaning and increase their ability. They will naturally be motivated to work, which will be beneficial to the nation, the employees, and the employers. If you don't believe it, please read the following facts.</p>
<p>In 1919, I participated in the May Fourth Movement and did my best to promote compulsory education, persuading the student unions of various schools and the joint associations of various business circles to open compulsory schools, and ordered the apprentices in the shops opened by the clan to study in compulsory schools. Unexpectedly, the manager objected on the grounds of hindering work, but I still insisted on letting them enter school. A year later, the apprentices increased their knowledge and improved their work. One of them has already been promoted to assistant manager and is capable of handling affairs. This shows a glimpse of the benefits of shops letting apprentices receive education.</p>
<p>The above is the fact that I have experienced. In this literacy education publicity week, it may be used as a reference?</p>

<h3>The First Day of the International Games Chinese Preliminary Round; National New Record for Women's Javelin; Ms. Pan Yingchu Creates 32.29 Meters; Hao Chunde's Javelin is Very Good; Qian Xing-su's Performance Declines</h3>
<p>The Chinese preliminary round of the Shanghai International Games was held at Zhongyuan yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock. A total of ten events were held in the men's and women's finals. In the women's javelin, Ms. Pan Yingchu threw three times in a row and broke the national record. The best result was 32.29 meters, which is far better than the old record of 27.75 meters held by Chen Rongming. Ms. Xu Yuan, who came in second with 27.93 meters, also exceeded the national record held by Chen. It was the most outstanding result of the day. Hao Chunde's 48.82 meters in the men's javelin was his masterpiece in his life, which is also rare. Ms. Qian Xing-su, the women's individual champion of the National Games two years ago, had no good results yesterday and fell behind. It is said that it was because she injured her foot playing basketball and has not yet recovered. In other events, Ms. Shi Ouqing's women's long jump result of 4.74 meters is also not far from the national record (4.88 meters).</p>
<p>Hao Chunde's Proud Masterpiece</p>
<p>Looking at the four men's field event finals, except for Hao Chunde's javelin, which was relatively satisfactory, the rest were mediocre. Tang Xianzhou, who came in second in the javelin with 47.44 meters, was also considered not weak. Gong Wanyu's 11.97 meters in the 16-pound shot put and Zhou Shunsheng's 11.93 meters in the second place were only barely satisfactory. Hao Chunde has degenerated in the long jump, and he was second to Wang He with 6.56 meters (Wang's result was 6.59 meters). The triple jump result was mediocre. Zhang Jia did not participate, which is inevitably disappointing.</p>
<p>Jia Lianren Has Unlimited Potential</p>
<p>In men's track events, there were few satisfactory results. Jia Lianren's 800 meters originally had the hope of breaking the national record. His strides were wide and his posture was very beautiful. He is indeed a rare talent in the middle distance. Unfortunately, he spent too much time in the first lap (the first 400 meters was run in 1 minute and 7 seconds (first)). Although he sprinted hard in the first lap, he only got 2 minutes and 9 seconds and 4 tenths. However, it is expected that he will be able to show his strengths in international competitions. Wang Zhenglin's 10,000 meters, 35 minutes and 4 seconds and 8 tenths, can be called the best in the country except for the old foreign man from Shanxi. He was exactly one lap ahead of the second-place Jin Zhongkang. Zhang Liang, who came in third, is a rising star in long-distance running. He has participated in various long-distance runs many times and his results are quite good. He competed fiercely with Wang Zhenglin in the first thirteen laps, not leaving an inch. Later, his strength was exhausted and he fell to third place, about 200 meters behind Jin Zhongkang. He Debao was first in the 400 meters, 56 seconds, which is very sluggish.</p>
<p>Shi Ouqing's Long Jump is Outstanding</p>
<p>Ms. Qian Xing-su, who holds three national records, participated in three competitions yesterday, but all fell behind. In the 50 meters and 100 meters, Qian was defeated by Li Sen, an unknown hero who came from behind, and both were more than one meter behind. However, Li Sen's results were not excellent. 7 seconds and 4 tenths in the 50 meters is equal to Chen Zaichun, who came in first in another group. 13 seconds and 9 tenths in the 100 meters. Chen Zaichun also belonged to another group, 15 seconds exactly, far inferior. Let's see if there will be any changes in the final tomorrow. In the final, Qian Xing-su's long jump was only third, and the result was much worse. Shi Ouqing's first place with 4.74 meters is rare.</p>
<p>Mediocre Results in the Preliminary Round</p>
<p>There were originally five men's track event preliminaries. Except for the middle hurdles, which were changed to be held tomorrow, the 400 meters and 800 meters were changed to the finals due to the small number of participants. The first place in the high hurdles originally belonged to Zhu Wenji, but was canceled due to falling four hurdles, and Tao Yingjie was promoted to first place, 17 seconds and 4 tenths, which is very sluggish. The results of the 100 meters and 200 meters were not good. Cheng Jinguan's absence was very disappointing. The veteran Hao Chunde only got 11 seconds and 9 tenths. Xue Jianqiu got 11 seconds and 6 tenths. Hao did not participate in the 200 meters. Dong and Xue were ranked first, and the results were mediocre.</p>

<h3>Second Day of Zhejiang Provincial Games</h3>
<p>Men's and Women's Track and Field Concluded Yesterday; Various Ball Games Commence Today</p>
<p>(Hangzhou, 3rd dispatch) The Fourth Zhejiang Provincial Games, the second day of which was (the 3rd), had weather as changeable as the previous day. The audience at the venue was still quite enthusiastic. Many schools suspended classes for students to attend the games, so the number of people remained over 20,000. Track and field, five-event, ten-event, national martial arts, and other sports events have all concluded. Ball games will begin tomorrow (the 4th). The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Various Performances</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, students from Fan Middle School performed acrobatics in the arena, directed by Zhou Shenzhang, a physical education teacher from Shantou. The performances featured various lively and beautiful poses. Subsequently, students from Zhijiang University performed floor exercises, which were also quite excellent, lasting half an hour. In the afternoon, after the national martial arts competition concluded, guests joined in for performances.</p>
<p>Remarks from the Chief Referee</p>
<p>Wu Bangwei, the chief referee of the games, told reporters yesterday that the games were going very well. Although there were one or two incidents, all athletes were able to demonstrate a spirit of abiding by the rules, which was very gratifying. Furthermore, the athletes were very hardworking, but they did not pay enough attention to methods. For example, when participating in the track events, they hunched over and bent their backs while running, swaying from side to side, with very poor posture. He hoped they would pay more attention to correcting these issues.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Handball Tournament Begins; Zhu Kuan Retains Championship Title</h3>
<h3>Kramer Second, Bao Shanli Third; Yesterday's Result: 2-0 Victory Over Kramer</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Sino-Western handball singles tournament, Zhu Kuan, with his outstanding skills and undefeated record, once again defeated Kramer in the final yesterday, maintaining his leading position among the heroes. The title of Shanghai handball king for this year still belongs to Zhu.</p>
<p>Final Standings of This Tournament</p>
<p>This is the second Shanghai Open Tournament. In the previous tournament, Zhu Kuan was the champion, Qu Keling was the runner-up, and Sun Daosheng was third. This year, Zhu Kuan is still the champion, Kramer is the runner-up, and Bao Shanhe is third. Last year's runner-up, Qu Keling, lost to Bao Shanli this time. Bao also lost to Kramer 14-21, 11-21. Third place Sun Daosheng retired from competition and did not participate.</p>
<p>How He Defeated His Opponents</p>
<p>Zhu always wins every match. The final match with Kramer was more promising. Kramer had suffered one defeat and needed to win twice to determine the outcome. Zhu only needed to win once to secure victory. In the first game, Kramer appeared nervous. Zhu took the lead with eight points, and Kramer gradually improved, but due to the disadvantage, he could not recover. Zhu's performance was so exquisite that he had unexpected skills. Zhu won the first game 21-13. At the beginning of the second game, the situation was tense. Kramer took the lead with 7-6 for the first time, but then Zhu Kuan took control, doing whatever he wanted. He had plenty of energy, handled the situation well, and hit every shot. His backhand was incredibly wonderful. Although Kramer lost, his results were still impressive. Zhu Kuan won the second game 21-11 and won this year's championship.</p>

The future silver market in Montreaux also fell by 2.7% to 2.8%. London raw gold fell by eight pence. British to American rose by .875, American to British rose by .875, British to French rose by 21 points, American to French shrank by .875. The opening price in the foreign exchange market was 1 shilling, 8 pence and .0625 for the near-term selling price for British exchange, and 40 yuan 375 for American exchange. Compared to the previous closing, British tightened by .0625, and American exchange was flat. After the opening, the announcement from the Associated Press that members of the American Banker Party, Yang Mai Si, etc., had questioned the government's slow silver purchase policy made the process firm under the Shanghai and Sassoon sale of shillings. The HSBC listing was announced, with British shrinking by .275 and American shrinking by .6875. HSBC and others took advantage of the cheapness to make up, and were still able to return to tightening. After entering, Sassoon still had sales, but because the banks' stomachs were very healthy, the overall situation was still flat. The later market was slightly loose due to the rise of Indian silver by 12, 14, and 14 anna. The banks still took it on the market, which could be maintained. However, the banks were still selling at a high price, so it was difficult to return to tightening. Later, Indian silver rose again by 14, 12, and 12 anna for the second time. Chinese merchants dumped again, and it turned hard. At the closing, the near-term selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling, 8 pence and 4375, and the American exchange was 41 yuan 25. Compared to the previous closing, British loosened by .3125, and American hardened by .875. The Chinese merchants' appetite for buying and selling was inconsistent. The hedging slightly sold a small number of shillings, and only more than 100,000 yuan of American exchange. Sassoon sold a lot of shillings. The banks' stomachs were still enthusiastic. Shanghai came out and then entered, and Zhejiang took shillings. Now, I will record the transaction price of the day.</p>

<h3>Money Market Situation Slightly Loose</h3>
<p>Interbank Rate Changed to Small Two Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation seemed to be slightly improving, although it was a temporary coincidence. However, the fourth bottom had passed, and silk and tea had not yet reached a critical time. Therefore, the market situation in the future may tend to be quiet in the short term. The interbank rate in the market opened at a small two points in the early market, changing to 18 cents. In the noon market, it once fell to 12 cents. However, the result was that it still returned to 18 cents when the closing price was adjusted. The added value was always added in vain.

<h3>Securities: 96 Drops Close to 8 Yuan; Northern Gang and Retail Investors Increase Purchases; Trading Accounts for Two-Thirds of Total Value</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the 96 issue experienced fluctuations. Initially, the volatility continued, followed by a gradual increase in short covering by short sellers, leading to stabilization. Speculating on the intentions of the sellers, there was a strong desire to suppress the small market price, opening a path for large short positions to exit. Their only tool was the usability of old notes. Upon investigation, the remaining amount of these old notes is estimated to be less than 10 million, with a total value of only over 800,000 yuan. Compared to other bonds, a transaction of just over a hundred would be sufficient to purchase the entire remaining amount. Recent trading in 96 has involved 5 to 6 million in and out each day, so there is no congestion in terms of market chips.</p>
<p>Although there was still selling pressure on the 4th yesterday, the Northern gang and retail investors were already actively buying. Issues 1, 11, 14, and 72 were in particularly strong demand, and the underlying prices have already stabilized slightly. Weighing the dangers of entering and exiting, avoiding the heavy and choosing the light, shorting is the more dangerous option. Arbitrage trading is especially common, and demand is particularly high this month. In terms of future prospects, if the suppression stops even slightly, there will definitely be a rebound. The opening prices for other bonds were slightly weak, with slight gains in the secondary market, not breaking free from the circling pattern. After the afternoon opening, issues 48 and 53 saw some selling, with slight declines of two or three jiao. Selling stopped at the close, and there was an immediate rebound of one or two jiao. Throughout the day, trading in 96 was still the most active, still seeking to account for two-thirds of the total value. The market price fell by half a yuan in the two morning sessions, and only by a small one or two jiao in the afternoon. The trend is either to advance or retreat, making it difficult to stabilize. Even market makers would likely be unable to force stabilization. Other issues also fell by a small one to two or three jiao each. There were still one or two issues with slight gains of five fen. The total volume of transactions amounted to 13,695,000 yuan, with 96 accounting for 7,085,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan; trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Rebound</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (2nd), the New York stock market rebounded. Chrysler Motors rose by over two yuan, with extremely active trading, due to the company's excellent first-quarter profits this year, earning 2.12 yuan per share, compared to only 0.76 yuan during the same period last year. Also, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph reached a new high price for 1935. Due to these two factors, most stocks advanced. Because silver prices in London, New York, and Montreal fell sharply, silver stocks were mixed. The decline in silver prices was due to the US Treasury's failure to raise silver prices, causing panic among speculators, leading to large-scale selling in London. The bond market fluctuated slightly. Small exchange stocks were mixed but firm. The total volume of trading for the day was 880,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Date | May 1st | May 2nd | Change</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks | 108.71 | 108.84 | Up 0.13</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: May Futures Generally Viewed Bearishly</h3>
<p>Yunnan Gang Rumored to Temporarily Suspend Trading in Spot Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, with a surprisingly strong downward trend. Due to rumors of a certain individual having to deliver in May, the market atmosphere is circulating that the May futures are generally viewed bearishly. Given even the slightest opportunity, the sellers' pressure is particularly intense. Upon investigation, the price of April futures for the 24th was 183 yuan. In just nine days, the price has fallen by 10 yuan. The market feels increasingly weak and listless.</p>
<p>Gold: Downward Trend Rising</p>
<p>The opening price for spot yarn was weak, continuing the previous month's weakness. Short sellers were particularly keen to see prices fall further, and selling pressure was especially heavy on May futures. However, with the month-to-month interest rate remaining flat, the closing price for each month was down by two, three, or four jiao compared to the previous day. The afternoon opening was suddenly weak, with a palpable sense of panic. The trading floor became considerably loose. It is said that Chaozhou gang's long positions were liquidated, and the sellers took advantage of this to apply pressure. The long positions in the near months were already like startled birds. Upon encountering unfavorable conditions, floating investors cut their losses, thus affecting the overall market. The far months also fell. Compared to the morning closing price, each month fell by between one yuan five jiao and one yuan one jiao, one yuan five jiao, and nine jiao. At the same time, spot yarn trading was quiet. Only Jifeng sold 450 bales, Dafeng 750 bales, Renfeng 1,250 bales, Tongfu 750 bales, Daji 1,100 bales, Dafu 450 bales, Changyu 600 bales, Taichang 850 bales, and Dachang 600 bales. Tongji bought 700 bales, Hexing 600 bales, Ruidai 1,650 bales, Dafu 1,550 bales, Suilong 650 bales, Jinchang 500 bales, Yuanda 500 bales, Taixing 500 bales, and Yichang 850 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Contract | High | Low | Close | Change from Previous Day | Volume</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>May | 174.8 | 173.1 | 173.1 | Down 1.80 | 40,200</p>

<p>Total | | | | | 192,100</p>
<p>Actual Sales Only 500 Bales</p>
<p>A telegram from the Yunnan Gang states that there is some unrest there, and trading in cotton yarn has been temporarily suspended. Yesterday, purchases by various gangs totaled only 502 bales. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts by each gang were as follows:</p>
<p>Wuhu 15, Guangdong 265, Nanjing 8, Xiamen 15</p>
<p>Shantou 10, Ningbo 4, Haizhou 35, Xuzhou 10</p>

<h3>Marked Cotton Bull Sentiment Still Good</h3>
<p>The cotton market was still strong in the morning, but fell in the afternoon due to the influence of the yarn market. However, judging by the market situation, cotton is still stronger than yarn, because although short positions have been closed, bull sentiment is still quite strong, adding to positions. Therefore, the market situation is slightly firm. However, if yarn prices do not rise, the impact on the cotton market will be significant.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Market Situation Better Than Jinji</p>
<p>The opening price for marked cotton was at the sailing plate. Silver prices contracted sharply, but marked gold prices trended downwards. The firm sentiment from the previous day had dissipated. There were fewer buyers in the market, and sellers were also lacking. The bulls’ intention was still strong, and near-month contracts rose by five fen compared to the previous day's closing price. The far months were flat. At the afternoon opening, the market followed the downturn in the yarn market, and selling pressure was slightly stronger. However, both short and long positions absorbed the selling. The market situation was firmer than that of the yarn market. As a result, near-month contracts fell by one jiao three fen compared to the morning closing price, and the far months fell by two jiao five fen. Upon investigation, Meiji sold 4,300 dan, Yongda 1,600 dan, Dafeng 1,600 dan, Mingde 1,100 dan, Hexing 3,100 zu, Shenji 1,500 zu, Renfeng 1,000 dan, Jiankang 4,000 zu, and Dachang 1,000 dan. Dahui bought 3,100 dan, Tongji 2,100 dan, Shengyuan 3,700, Yuanda 2,900 dan, Jinchang 2,200 dan, Changhe 4,900 dan, and Changfeng 800 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Contract | High | Low | Close | Change | Open Interest</p>

<h3>Awaiting Developments in US Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened lower, due to the liquidation of long positions, selling from the Far East, Wall Street, and New Orleans, and weakness in silver prices and the wheat market. All months, except for old cotton, fell by approximately three to six points. Although demand for old cotton is sluggish, traders are purchasing large quantities. Currently, both sides are still awaiting developments in the spot market and the government's policies regarding cotton futures. It is said that after the return of Mr. Johnston, manager of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, there may be hopes for important developments. In the afternoon, short covering and purchases of October contracts by traders and spot merchants led to a rebound and firm closing. Spot prices remained unchanged. Futures prices rose by three to seven points. British cotton spot prices rose by three points, and futures prices fell by seven or eight points. Indian cotton arbitrage purchases of April/May and July/August contracts were shifted to April/May of next year. Fairgold rose by one to two rupees, Oomra rose by one to two rupees, and Broach rose by 0.75 to 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (2nd telegram):</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Broach cotton for July/August on the 3rd is 240.5 rupees, the same as the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Futures Experience Heavy Selling</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of various months fell sharply. Chicago wheat was quoted down by 3.3 jiao and Canadian wheat down by 1 jiao. When prices opened, foreign wheat continued to decline, and gold prices also fell. The recent weather has also been good, so after the opening, the prices for various months gradually weakened. Furthermore, sales have also stalled after a large number of transactions, so the near term is not as tight as it was a few days ago. At the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere for various months continued to weaken. Although selling from various mills was sporadic, the market sentiment followed the trend and was uniformly bearish. If actual sales do not move and mill stocks increase, prices may have to fall further. As a result, the current month fell by 2 fen, June fell by 2.75 fen, July fell by 3.25 fen, August/September fell by 3 fen, and October fell by 2.5 fen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, prices for various months were generally flat. Chicago wheat was quoted down by 3.3 jiao and Canadian wheat down by 1 jiao. After the opening, near-term contracts have long been suspended due to the transition between new and old crops. Transactions for July and beyond were with domestic customers. Before the new wheat harvest, most people are taking a wait-and-see approach, so trading is quiet, and prices fell by only one or two fen. At the afternoon opening, with the sharp fall in gold prices and weakness in the flour market, selling increased slightly, and the market atmosphere weakened accordingly. It is reported that domestic new crops are entering the market. If the weather remains good, samples should be available in about twenty days, at which time the wheat market should be bustling. As a result, July fell by 5 fen, August fell by 4 fen, and September fell by 3 fen. The spot wheat market saw firm prices for high-quality wheat and weakness for medium- and low-quality wheat. As the new crop is approaching, the outlook is for flat prices. Shandong wheat opened at 3.97 yuan, medium quality at 3.94 yuan, Suzhou wheat at 3.97 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 3.95 yuan, Anhui/Jiangbei wheat at 3.85 yuan, Henan wheat at 3.88 yuan, Zhumadian wheat at 3.83 yuan, and Aokou wheat at 3.70 yuan. Fuxin took 3,000 bags and Fufeng took 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat | May 1st | May 2nd | Change</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>July | 98.215 | 97.625 | Down 1.00</p>
<p>September | 98.750 | 97.750 | Down 1.00</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat | May 1st | May 2nd | Change</p>

<h3>Large Amount of New Imported Rice Arrives, Nearly 20,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Sold Out to Local Customers; A Few Doomi Arrived</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of foreign rice in Yangke was lively and foreign rice was traded actively as it was smoothly purchased by inland customers. Small quantities were traded with various routes from Nanjing Yangtze by local street. The northern ocean suffered a wind and drought disaster, with a small amount of rice continually loaded, causing the rice market to be even more lively. Without financial difficulties, market prices will continue to rise gradually. However, yesterday saw another increase of prices by five to six fen to one jiao. There were a total of 27,000 bags of Saigon spot goods sold, 3,500 bags of small grained rice, and a total of 8,000 bags of Siamese and Min Dang Gao Gong Qie La Di. In addition, there were 19,500 bags of large grain rice. Together with the Ke Xian, it totaled to about 60,000 bags. As current Ke Cao trading is so brisk, the future is still optimistic. The 19,500 bags of Da Wen rice sold yesterday were newly arrived in Shanghai. Because Da Jiao rice had not arrived in the port for many years after the harvest from producing areas was bad, this rice's character and price most suitable for the inner land and common people, and was thus snapped by inner land and local areas after being seen, being sold entirely.</p>
<p>Yesterday, (South Shanghai) the source of local rice was scarce, with a total of 10 boats arriving, totaling 2,000 stones of goods. Sellers drove the price up, causing buyers to be stagnant. Because there was a limited sales market and only 300 bags for Qingdao Gang to trade, although thick geng and thin dao rice prices rose slightly by one or two jiao, not much was traded and the situation was not special. The cause was a shortage of goods and a slightly tight situation. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 boats arrived from He Xia, going in various directions. For all varieties, white geng rice was sluggish in the morning and trading was stagnant, but in the afternoon, the retail market turned fresh and the morning shape market became soft, while the late market was firm. The early, thin Dao rice was quite lively, but the intermediate and inferior rice was flat. Prices for superior material rose and middle to low grades were tiring. The sales shape of white rice has stabilized. There was not much activity in other goods.</p>
<p>Gaoliang and corn prices in Dalian are firm, because the Japanese army prohibits farming, the production last year south of the Manchu Railway and other railways does not compare to past abundance. Shanghai markets must digest disaster accounts from the inner land and distillation of alcohol, so markets show that demand is over supply. Yesterday, 1,500 bags of red rice were loaded and sent to Bengbu and were sold out. Tianjing corn newly arrived one to two thousand bags in the prior day and were sold out in two days. Yesterday's price opened at 4.19 yuan, again jumping up nearly one jiao. Comparing with the end of the prior month, this represents a stepwise upward increase of 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: British and French Purchase 80 Bales of Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>The silk industry has already passed the bottom in April, and foreign exchange has eased slightly, so there is a gradual turnaround. If exchange rates can provide further assistance, the market atmosphere will be revived. Although New York and Yokohama have been slightly lower than before, users and Citibank remain quiet in recent days. In the past two days, Jardine Matheson and Taft Lyon-London exports totaled 80 bales. The Chinese silk export statistics from April 16th to April 30th are listed below:</p>
<p>Region | Europe | America | India | Other | Total</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Silk | 768 | 0 | 0 | 256 | 1024</p>
<p>Douppion Silk | 0 | 11 | 58 | 0 | 69</p>
<p>Grey Silk | 80 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 90</p>
<p>Yellow Earth Silk | 10 | 0 | 5 | 14 | 29</p>
<p>Yellow Silk | 15 | 0 | 10 | 2 | 27</p>
<p>White Earth Silk | 1 | 0 | 22 | 2 | 25</p>
<p>Reeled Silk | 62 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 65</p>
<p>Yellow Filature Silk | 28 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 31</p>
<p>White Filature Silk | 237 | 235 | 0 | 5 | 477</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Black Tea Market Opens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Min Province's Bailing black tea was opened at Jardine Matheson for 25.5 yuan. This is much less than last year. The situation for Zhuang black tea is taking a heavy blow because of competition from Taiwanese tea in Japan. The Green tea market still has not seen progress, only Xiehe purchased 20 crates of Tu Zhuang Zhengmei, opening for 82 yuan and had no gains or losses.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Slab Indigo Price Hike Fails</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a weakened trend with Guanjin easing slightly. The guild marked 24 Dutch Crude White, and foreign stack goods were called for 16.5 yuan without success, lower than by 0.05 yuan. The stack good traded for 16.5 yuan. Transfer goods available for today traded for 5.1 yuan, with no change. 8/9 Dutch red called for 12.6 yuan, Taikoo B mark called for 17.2 yuan, lower than 0.2 jiao without success. The local factory's Mianbai Zhenyu #1 is still 15.9 yuan, #2 is 15.8 yuan, #3 is 15.75 yuan, and #4 is 15.6 yuan. Nationally produced slabs are out of stock. Recently, both Guangdong and Fujian number houses have sent over goods. Yesterday the market called for 10 yuan but failed. Chaozhou indigo sales remain stagnant and prices are difficult to raise, resulting in there being no further openings.</p>

<h3>Drips and Drops</h3>
<p>— (Boundless)</p>
<p>Fortune tellers, face readers, venereal disease hospitals... stand side-by-side, beggars, prostitutes… dense as stars, adultery, theft… news fills the eyes, this is the characteristic of Chinese cities.</p>
<p>Long hair, broken shoes, large bow ties, nearsightedness, today publishing a collection, tomorrow issuing a novel, this is the culture of Chinese cities.</p>
<p>Small bookstalls in the streets and lanes display all sorts of thin booklets, rented for women, children, and laborers to read; while singing "The seventh day arrives, crying mournfully," while peddling his small books, this is the education of Chinese cities.</p>
<p>Indian policemen confiscate the rickshaw puller's permit, foreign gangsters whip randomly gathered pedestrians, this is the authority of Chinese cities.</p>
<p>While singing the high tune of loving and using domestic goods, the body is wearing luxurious Western clothes, outwardly doing patriotic work, but in reality willingly being used by others, stipulating a women’s domestic goods year, the import of cosmetics has actually increased dramatically, this is the patriotic atmosphere of Chinese cities.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Western Suits</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>About forty to fifty percent of people in Shanghai wear Western suits. In fact, wearing Western suits is more convenient and economical than wearing Chinese clothing. No wonder people are changing their attire one after another. I fear that in the near future, among men under forty years old, you won't find anyone wearing Chinese clothing. Speaking of convenience, whether going up or down stairs at home, or getting on or off vehicles on the road, there are no cumbersome problems. Even when traveling, just having a coat is enough. Speaking of economy, Chinese clothing includes leather, camel wool, lined,夹 (jia - lined but thinner than衬), single-layer clothing, which must be changed with the seasons. This clothing expense is considerable. As for Western suits, one set is enough for spring, autumn, and winter. In winter, just add a thick coat, and in spring and autumn, wear a light coat. Preparing summer suits is even easier. Some savvy friends even go to Wusong Road to pick up a suit for a little over ten dollars, and all the accessories are included. Walking down the street, they look proud and majestic, representing the new era.</p>
<p>However, the materials for Western suits are nothing more than wool and绒 (rong - velvet/fleece). These wool fabrics are entirely imported, and the money flowing to foreign countries is immeasurable annually. I remember that the year before last, when I was teaching a course at a certain girls' school, a very mischievous girl deliberately asked how to enrich the country. I replied without thinking, "First, the people of the country must not buy foreign goods." The girl then said, "Since that's the case, why do you wear a Western suit?" I was speechless. Fortunately, the class was over, so I pretended to be foolish and left. It's not that I don't want to use domestic materials to make Western suits, but when domestic materials are worn, in no time, the collar ends and the corners of the clothes will uncontrollably curl up, not conforming well. I sincerely hope that our country's industrialists engaged in textiles will work hard to research and improve, so as to recover our economic rights.</p>
<p>On the cuffs of Western suits, there are often several buttons without buttonholes. At one time, many people discussed their purpose, but the discussion yielded no results. I always feel that these are superfluous and can be removed. Also, the trousers of Western suits are always made very long, with a fold at the bottom, so as not to hinder walking. I think instead of folding, it would be better to make them shorter in the first place. Moreover, the fold accumulates dust and dirt, which is very unhygienic and has a hundred harms and no benefits. It would be better to abolish this style.</p>
<h3>The Disillusionment of a New Family</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Mr. Shen, who lived alone, fell in love with Ms. Yang in the autumn of last year. After half a year of courtship, they made a marriage vow to remain together until the end of time and held a formal wedding at a large restaurant, starting a small family life together. Mr. Shen was a noble person, and Ms. Yang was a high-achieving student. A perfect match, truly a match made in heaven. Everyone admired their blissful marriage.</p>
<p>After the wedding, they lived in great harmony, with laughter and music often coming from their room. But one night a month later, the music stopped, and the laughter was gone, replaced by the sound of the couple arguing. It only quieted down in the middle of the night. The next day, Mr. Shen went out early in a hurry to go to work, and Ms. Yang did not have the smile on her lips as she usually did.</p>
<p>According to their maid, the reason for their argument was a quick retort in their conversation.</p>
<p>A day passed quickly. In the evening, Mr. Shen came home very late. As soon as he arrived, the couple continued to argue. By midnight, they were fighting. Just as dawn was breaking, Ms. Yang went back to her mother's house in a fit of anger. As she left, Mr. Shen shouted angrily, "If you leave, don't come back."</p>
<p>A week later, the couple appeared in mediation court. Both sides had lawyers. Ms. Yang also presented a medical certificate documenting her injuries. After a period of mediation by the judge, under mutually agreed conditions, they signed the divorce papers.</p>
<p>From then on, Mr. Shen continued to live alone. He said, "Marriage is the graveyard of love!"</p>

<h3>The Story of Gambling</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>Gambling is inherently a bad thing, capable of ruining families. But with good luck, it can sometimes help families prosper. However, this is rare and not to be taken as a model. Now, I will record two stories below, one of bankruptcy and one of rising from gambling, for readers' amusement.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a relative surnamed Jin. His family originally had hundreds of acres of fertile land. They also owned several buildings in a bustling area of the South City of Shanghai. But these properties have long since changed hands. It turned out that decades ago, on New Year's Eve, Mr. Jin's grandfather invited several relatives and friends for a New Year's Eve dinner. After the banquet, the host became excited and played dice with a close friend, Mr. So-and-so. They agreed to bet a certain property as a single, all-or-nothing wager. The property Mr. Jin wagered was the aforementioned buildings. As a result, Mr. Jin lost with a roll of the dice. The property was transferred and the surname changed from that point onward. Later, Mr. So-and-so, because he was good friends with Mr. Jin, stated that Mr. Jin would still collect some of the rent each year. At the time of his death, he even left a will instructing his descendants to abide by this arrangement. So, until now, Mr. Jin still goes to Shanghai every year to collect more than a thousand dollars in rent from the owner, and there is no contract. In the past, it was only several hundred thousand (coins), but as land prices rose, it increased to this amount, but it is still less than one-fifth of the current rent!</p>
<p>I used to live with a man named Hong, who was very poor. He worked in a domino shop, earning only a few dollars a month. It was impossible to think about starting a family and a career. One year, the end of the year arrived, and he got a few dozen dollars, which he took to a gambling den. He won repeatedly, winning two or three thousand dollars in a few days. So he used the money to marry a wife and start a family. He also partnered with several shareholders and opened his own domino shop. In recent years, all industries have been saying that the economy is bad. But his business has been doing well, with annual profits. People jokingly say to him, if he hadn't gone to the gambling den that day, how could he have had the qualifications to marry a wife and become a boss?</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, I Lower the Curtain to Avoid Guests; Diligently Saving Lamp Oil, I Copy Books at Dawn</p>
<p>As soon as I entered, I saw another strange thing: three or four students were lying on the stone steps, writing with pencils. When I looked closer, I saw that they were copying someone else's copy onto their own. I asked them why they were copying books so early in the morning. He said, "By morning, the classmate needs his own copy, so he can't lend it to others to copy." I said, "Why don't you copy in the classroom?" He said, "The friends in the classroom are copying the formulas on the blackboard, and we're copying separately to avoid getting mixed up." I said, "You can also copy in your sleeping room." He said, "The room is too dark to see the book. And there are seven or eight people sleeping in the room, and there are only two benches and a small table, so not many people can sit." He wasn't lying. Some of them lived in cave dwellings, which were known to be dark. Those living in houses had small windows, covered with a piece of blue cloth, which was almost as dark as a cave. Because glass was a scarce item in the west, no one would use glass for their windows. As for using paper to paste the windows, unfortunately, there were too many windy days. Each gust of wind could tear the window paper to shreds. Zhou Yourong smiled and said, "You're exaggerating a bit. We in the east also have windy days, but it doesn't mean that window paper can't exist." Zhiqian said, "My county magistrate, you're in a place with trees, so you don't know that in places without trees, people save as much wood as possible when building houses. Their windows can't be like the windows in eastern houses, using fine wood to make tight window lattices." (196)</p>
<h3>The Imperial Fragrance Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, the embroidery patterns here cannot be as diverse as those on shoes. They can only be limited to butterflies and bats. Other patterns may not be impossible to use, but if used, they probably wouldn't look very good.</p>
<p>I have already discussed the Empress Dowager's shoes and socks very clearly. As for how she wore them, it was the same as ordinary Manchus. The socks were about three or four inches higher than the shoe walls, and a soft silk ribbon was first tied tightly around the leg, then the trouser legs were pulled down and placed over the sock tops, and then tied with a silk ribbon. The color of this ribbon was always the same as the color of the pants themselves, mostly cut from a piece of the same material. This way of tying the trouser legs, as we think of it now, must be very unsightly, but in the past, everyone did it this way, so it didn't feel strange. Moreover, because of these two ties, not only would the socks never wrinkle, but the trouser legs would never come loose, so you would always feel very neat and tidy when moving.</p>
<p>Because so many phoenix shoes and satin socks needed to be made by the hands of the shoe-making women, this group of girls, although formally or in terms of class, were roughly the same as the palace maids in the palace, they were actually very different! Palace maids in the palace had no status. It could be said that they were inferior to the eunuchs. All kinds of hard work were their responsibility. They were simply busy serving others all day long, while the artisans not only did not need to serve others, but also had designated eunuchs to serve them! (306)</p>
<p>Places Visited</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of the Ancient Site of the Confucius Forest</h3>
<p>— Zhurong Shi</p>
<p>The Confucius Forest is where Confucius is buried, and it is also one of the ancient sites of Qufu. It is located three li outside the north gate of Qufu city. The Qufu station of the Jinpu Railway is built eighteen li away from Qufu city because of the Confucius Forest, fearing that the passage of vehicles would disturb Confucius's tomb. This is a sign of respect for Confucius!</p>
<p>After leaving the north gate of Qufu city, you can see a row of tall pines and cypresses, planted in an ancient and verdant manner on both sides of the pedestrian path leading to the Confucius Forest. This can also express the greatness of Confucius's learning. After passing two li of pine and cypress-lined path, a memorial archway-style gate appears, with the two large characters "孔林" (Kong Lin, Confucius Forest) written on it. This is the entrance to the Confucius Forest. Entering the gate of the Confucius Forest, short pink walls are built on both sides, planted with towering pines and cypresses, similar in size to those on the pedestrian path. Walking further in, there is Confucius's ancestral hall. Several pairs of stone carvings stand in front of the hall, which are necessary objects for ancient tombs.</p>
<p>At the place where you turn into the Confucius Forest, there is a "dismount stele." In the autocratic era, regardless of soldiers, civilians, or officials, they could no longer use horses or sedan chairs to travel in front of this stele. Confucius's dignity is fully expressed in this point.</p>
<p>Inside the Confucius Forest, what you see are many tombs of the Confucius family. A tombstone stands in front of each tomb, indicating the name of the person buried inside. The one in the center is exceptionally grand and majestic, and the tombstone is also particularly tall. This is naturally Confucius's tomb. The tombstone is engraved with the words "至聖先師孔宜王" (Most Sage and First Teacher, King Yi of Confucius). Those who admire the Confucius Forest naturally feel reverence when they arrive here, knowing that the greatest teacher of all generations, Confucius, is buried inside this tomb. The tomb in front of Confucius's tomb is the tomb of Zisi, the Transmitter Sage, who transmitted Confucius's learning. The rest of the tombs are all of the Confucius family. The most touching one is the tomb of the Restorer. The lineage of Confucius can be passed down to this day, with the Duke Yansheng lineage still existing, thanks to this meritorious official of the restoration, whose heroic deeds are still praised throughout Qufu.</p>
<p>After Confucius's death, Zigong guarded the tomb. This admirable deed has long been passed down. Behind Confucius's tomb, an earthen platform and several houses are built. A stone stele commemorating Zigong's tomb guarding stands on the platform. It can be known that this is where Zigong lived when he guarded the tomb. Zigong's hand-planted scholar tree was planted by Zigong when he was guarding the tomb. Today, it is completely dry. It is surrounded by iron rings and short walls, which only makes people feel a sense of history and becomes an ancient site.</p>
<p>Inside the Confucius Forest cemetery, there are countless towering pines and cypresses, which make the Confucius Forest even more solemn and ancient. Seeing the tombstone in front of Confucius's tomb makes people think of the greatness of Confucius's learning. It is not accidental that he became a teacher for all generations!</p>

<h3>On Liang Shuming in Commemoration of the May Fourth Movement</h3>
<p>— Li Maimai</p>
<p>"Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies"</p>
<p>By Liang Shuming, published by Commercial Press, price: 90 cents</p>
<p>Now is another period of re-evaluating the value of all past thoughts. If we should rigorously criticize even the relatively progressive intellectual leaders of the May Fourth era, such as Hu Shi, then we should not let the works of the backward thinkers of the May Fourth era, such as Liang Shuming, pass lightly. Moreover, Liang Shuming's works have now become the supreme scripture for the restorationists.</p>
<p>Liang Shuming's "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," ideologically, is an attempt by traditional Chinese thought to rejuvenate under the threat of modern thought; historically, it is merely a last burst of light from old China before the arrival of new China.</p>
<p>When China was entering the entrance to a new era, two Chinese with intellectual talent both attempted to use Western philosophy and science to rejuvenate and youthify the withered and aging traditional Chinese thought. One was Tan Sitong, the author of "Ren Xue" (Benevolence Studies), and the other was Liang Shuming, the author of "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies." Although both of these people developed traditional philosophy from the same starting point, their historical significance is not without distinction; no, their distinction is extremely obvious.</p>
<p>If Tan Sitong's forcible and undigested attempt to youthify traditional Chinese philosophy with Western thought and science contained progressive significance, then Liang Shuming's similar work only has reactionary significance. If Tan Sitong's "Ren Xue" played a promoting role in the "Reform" movement of the time, then Liang Shuming's "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies" is completely a reaction to the May Fourth New Culture Movement. Although Liang Shuming himself did not directly participate in the 利立 (Li Li) debate, Liang Shuming was the leader of the metaphysical aspect at the time.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned internal reasons, the rampant decadent thought in Europe after the Great War was also one of the major reasons that prompted Liang Shuming to dare to make a fool of himself. Gu Hongming, Tagore, and even Liang Qichao were praised by Europeans at the time because Europe was in a critical condition, so Eastern thought in the form of ghosts and monsters was temporarily popular in Europe, which made Liang Shuming dare to issue the grand wish of using Eastern culture to save Western culture. We know that this in practice only made knowledgeable Europeans laugh at the Chinese!</p>
<p>Liang Shuming's fundamental error is definitely not, as Hu Shi said, that he should not have sought the "entirety" of Eastern and Western cultures; on the contrary, seeking the entirety of culture is the responsibility of thinkers who study culture. Because any culture is an integral whole, not a chaotic accumulation of cultural objects. Hu Shi's use of Chinese people's "eating rice" and "chopsticks" to oppose Liang Shuming's "setting a line" to understand Eastern and Western cultures is completely wrong.</p>
<p>Where does Liang Shuming's fundamental error lie? In his Eastern metaphysical method, in his Eastern metaphysical method of petrifying the changing, developing, and progressing Eastern and Western cultures and their philosophies, which can sometimes regress due to national or class reasons, into three unchanging, empty principles. This method is completely a reprint of Xunzi's thought of "the same principle remains constant throughout ancient and modern times," and is completely anti-historical and anti-scientific.</p>
<p>According to Liang Shuming, the fundamental spirit of Western culture is to desire to move forward. If Liang Shuming's words refer to European culture after the Renaissance, then how does Liang Shuming explain the more than a thousand years of stagnant European medieval cultural life? Also, Liang Shuming says that Chinese culture is intended to be harmonious, but when we examine the development of Chinese culture after the Qin Dynasty, it proceeds entirely along a curved line; it rises and falls, and after falling, it rises again. How does Liang Shuming explain this?</p>
<p>Liang Shuming's error lies in his treating the dominant thought of a specific stage of a particular society of a certain nation as the developmental principle of the entire cultural history of all nations. The so-called doctrine of the mean, which intends to be harmonious, is by no means a Chinese product. If Liang Shuming had read Aristotle's "Ethics," he would have known that Aristotle's doctrine of the mean is no less than Confucius's doctrine of the mean. The so-called doctrine of the mean is merely an expression of the reformist thought of the ancient aristocracy. What is so amazing about it?</p>
<p>The Western path of desiring to move forward, which Liang Shuming is so surprised by, is by no means unique to the West. This kind of thought, regardless of ancient or modern times, regardless of China or foreign countries, will inevitably be produced as long as there is the development of capitalism and the bourgeoisie. Weren't the ancient Indian materialists and the Chinese Yang Zhu and Han Fei all advocating the desire to move forward?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the desire to move backward is not a special product of India either. If Liang Shuming had studied the hermits in the Egyptian desert, the Stoics of Greece and Rome, and the Chinese Zhuangzi and Chen Zhongzi, he would know that the Chinese and Western desires to move backward are no less than the Indian ascetics. From this, we can know that the desire to hold the middle, move forward, or move backward are merely three different class psychological expressions of specific societies, and cannot be used as the permanent principles of the cultures of Chinese, Western, and Indian nations.</p>
<p>Although the above three principles can sometimes maintain their dominance in a particular nation, it is determined by the development or lack of development of the social economy, and is definitely not determined by these three abstract principles to determine the cultural form and lifestyle of each nation.</p>
<p>Liang Shuming's way of reversing cause and effect is entirely because he is an idealist combining Chinese and Indian thought!</p>
<h3>Impressions of Various Bookstores</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>Commercial Press—China—World</p>
<p>(1) The Commercial Press—What is a bookstore? The Commercial Press—There are two groups of people who equate the common noun "bookstore" with the proper noun "Commercial Press." Before 1925, the Commercial Press was indeed second to none and regarded itself as the leader.</p>
<p>The angry tide of the National Revolution pushed the giant wheel of culture. The new book industry rose along with the new literature and new social sciences. On the Fourth Horse Road, bookstores sprang up like mushrooms. There was a time when progressive young people did not set foot in the Commercial Press except to buy textbooks. And the Commercial Press did not "follow the trend." Everyone said, "Hmph, the Commercial Press is declining!"</p>
<p>However, soon the situation changed. The Commercial Press watched as a large number of small bookstores closed their doors and went bankrupt, while it still stood firm.</p>
<p>On January 28th, the Japanese iron birds pecked and destroyed the entire Commercial Press. The enlightened textbooks of the World Bookstore tripled their profits during the Commercial Press's shutdown, and some even regarded themselves as successors to the Commercial Press. Everyone thought that the Commercial Press would be difficult to recover.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese iron birds did destroy much of the Commercial Press's material wealth, but at the same time, they also destroyed the Commercial Press's deeply rooted "relations of production" (forgive me for misusing this term). After resuming business, the Commercial Press made even more leaps and bounds on a new foundation. "The Eastern Miscellany" and "The Educational Review" once again occupied the top spot in magazine sales.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press... New Books Daily... Children's Library... Complete Library of the Four Treasuries! Wang Yunwu..." (The Commercial Press has once again become a giant in the book industry and the biggest threat to all bookstores.</p>
<p>(2) China Book Company—Almost as old as the Commercial Press. But we don't see anything intuitively, except for instruments and calligraphy. Yes, China Book Company's main profit-making items are instruments and equipment, except for the factory site property.</p>
<p>In terms of publishing, it is difficult to see what characteristics China Book Company has. At the height of the popularity of the new literature, China Book Company published the advertisement for the "China Literary Series" edited by Xu Zhimo. It wasn't until Xu Zhimo died and the trend of literary books had passed that we saw those few books come slowly. The "New China Textbooks" once sold well, but the Ministry of Education's "Temporary Curriculum Standards" became "outdated," and the set of books also faded away.</p>
<p>But, among many periodicals, we cannot but praise "New China" as being relatively progressive. Short and concise, and sometimes there are a few academic texts that are not in the "famous people's inscriptions" style, especially the past first volume.</p>
<p>(3) World Book Company—In terms of quantity and scale, World Book Company has invariably been in third place. In the past, when we mentioned World Book Company, we would think of Red House, Red Rose, Tales of Knights-Errant, and various love stories, sad stories, and guides, etc.</p>
<p>Soon, World Book Company made rapid progress, not only publishing many textbooks for primary and secondary schools (and often two books of each kind, which is even more characteristic), but also publishing many university textbooks of two or three hundred thousand words. There was a time when World Book Company and the Commercial Press were competing fiercely step by step. The Commercial Press had a university series, and so did the World Book Company. The Commercial Press had "New Books Daily," and so did the World Book Company. Sometimes, the World Book Company even surpassed the Commercial Press. For example, the "World Primary School Textbooks" in a certain year were rated higher than those of the Commercial Press and China Book Company by the so-called teachers' associations in certain places in the autumn semester.</p>
<p>However, many of World Book Company's characteristics are still unfathomable. Such as the World Bank, the Dahua Bookstore, and the World Publishing Cooperative, which are truly like a ring of stars, beyond the reach of other bookstores.</p>
<p>The change in the World Book Company's publishing direction was due to the triple profits of "ABC," but perhaps it is for this reason that people cannot help but feel a sense of "ABC" about the World Book Company's books, even the most profound university series.</p>

<h3>Beyond the Art Exhibition Preview</h3>
<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>I finally saw the British-Chinese art exhibition preview at the old Bank of China building. Others said the items on display were second or third-rate, but I thought the bronzes and porcelains were quite good and worth seeing. Unfortunately, I was there with a large group of students, constantly giving instructions and answering questions, so I hardly had time to examine them carefully. They asked me two or three questions, and I could only answer one or two, which already took up half the day. I couldn’t be an all-knowing and all-understanding person, so I compromised and settled for being fifty-knowing and fifty-understanding.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang! Look at this 'Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains' painting! Where is Yan Ziling's Fishing Terrace?" By chance, I had taken a trip there alone during the week-long spring break. Now that the famous painting was in front of me, I had to give it at least one glance. The so-called "brocade screen and embroidered peaks" of the mountain scenery were vaguely reminiscent, perhaps one or two out of ten. The most wonderful swirling eddies, the scenic spot of Seven Li 　, were not visible. I suppose the scroll was not fully unfurled and they were covered up?</p>
<p>Speaking of Yan Ziling's Fishing Terrace, here comes the question. Two large, square, fortress-like boulders stood on a mountainside seventy or eighty feet high. To say that one could fish there would be even more impossible than "climbing a tree to catch fish." How long would the fishing line have to be, and how big would the fish have to be? Many fools and poets are indulging their foolishness and writing their poetry in the "approximate but impossible" imagination. In reality, the answer to this question is quite simple:</p>
<p>Yan Ziling was a native of the Fuchun River, and it is possible that he lived in seclusion and fished there. However, there is also a Yan Ziling Fishing Terrace in Suzhou, so it must be taken into consideration – one cannot fish in only one place – why does fishing require a terrace? Why build such a pretentious mountain forest structure? Ultimately, it is because Emperor Guangwu supported him, and later generations also supported Emperor Guangwu, so they found a place to commemorate this great event, and the boulders were chosen for this purpose – the selection probably happened after Li Bai, because Li Bai's poem contains the lines, "Please leave the fishing line on the boulder, the fishing is about to end," which created this allusion – but there are two boulders – it wouldn't be impossible to give one to Xie 　yu as a souvenir.</p>
<p>Behind the "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" painting is a scroll of the "Boundless Yangtze River," and the portraits of Emperor Taizu and Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty are also worth looking at and talking about. However, since I want to talk about things outside the exhibition, I can stop here.</p>
<p>Looking at the bronzes – as the saying goes, "Poor! Even if poor, there are still thirty-six thousand copper coins." Could this be a fitting inscription for the bronze room? I think the bronzes selected for the room are very good. My old friend Zhou Jinwen Cun, the author, Mr. Zou An, said so, which shows it is not just my personal opinion. From unearthed items to well-preserved items, one by one, group by group, with inscriptions and patterns, not ritual vessels, burial objects, or mortuary items, but rather containers, warming vessels, cooking utensils, and common utensils. Instead of the confusing so-called "dun," the ones identified by Guo Moruo as 　. This took up a lot of my time and effort, explaining and instructing the students, but since the conversation took place inside the exhibition, I can avoid repeating it here – but the term "common utensils" seems too broad and needs further consideration; perhaps this category is unnecessary. Among the so-called "common utensils," there is one item, number 82, a Panhui-patterned mirror, labeled as a Warring States period artifact. There is a pattern in the mirror, which is currently called a "four-in-one Ruyi" style pattern. Other artifacts with this pattern, such as the stone carvings from Lishi County in Shanxi, the gilded "four-in-one Ruyi" bronze pieces in our collection, and the fragments of small tin flower pieces, all match the pattern in this mirror. I have previously researched this pattern as Baosheng, Jinsheng, Fang Sheng, Hua Sheng, Cai Sheng, etc. Whether this pattern existed during the Warring States period has not yet been determined. Baosheng is one question, and Ruyi is another question, and they should be discussed separately. Regarding the Ruyi section, an Englishman named Hopkins wrote a long article in the 1923 "Bulletin," stating that it was transmitted from Buddhism. If we consider it to be Baosheng, perhaps we would not be constrained by Hopkins' discussion!</p>
<p>The bronze collection from Xinzheng – I was disappointed that the piece with the inscription "Prince Ying Ci..." was not selected. Looking at the craftsmanship of this bronze collection, the northern colors are still strongly preserved. After being unearthed, some people suspected that they were Chu artifacts that had spread to the Central Plains, but I am afraid not!</p>
<p>The bronze collection from Shouxian – number 106, the zu, is truly unprecedented. The cross-shaped pattern in the zu is probably not "for draining juice," as stated in the explanation. Perhaps it was used for smoking and roasting fish and meat? – Number 108, the square plate with a looped handle, has an inscription of nine characters, which is the same as the inscription on a broken dou in our collection – Number 105, the Chu King Kan Ken Ding, has an inscription of twelve characters, which is the same as the characters on the edge of the large bronze ding from Shouxian discovered in Shanghai in January of the twenty-third year. When the Shouxian bronzes were first discovered, I heard from Mr. Tan Tian that many were lost and not all were stored in the Anhui Library. The origin of the broken dou in our collection is a bit of a joke. I bought it from a Shanghai merchant named Sa on the evening of December of the twenty-second year, paid a fair price, and kept it for some time. However, when I played with it, I always had doubts, so I returned it and got my money back. A year later, I remembered the inscription and bought it again. Now, comparing it with number 108, the characters that I didn't recognize are still unknown. I don't know how Rong Geng identified the characters in his "Illustrated Catalog of Chu Bronzes," so I need to investigate.</p>
<p>Finally, I saw the two glass display cases of archaeological selections from the Academia Sinica. Unfortunately, the explanatory booklet had not yet arrived at the exhibition, so I will have to spend some more money to go back and review them. Among them, the bone axes and spearheads have already caught my attention, but I have not yet reached a conclusion. I will wait until I go back and look at them again before commenting.</p>
<p>Here is an excessive request: The Academia Sinica has conducted numerous excavations, but the number of publications is still limited. Why not hold a large-scale public exhibition so that people can also taste a forbidden fruit?</p>

<h3>Shortwave Components (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shengshi</p>
<p>At high frequencies, the current tends to flow along the surface of the wire, so the plating on the coil must be carefully considered. Since silver is the most conductive metal, silver-plated wires have been used for shortwave coils. However, at radio frequencies, the conductivity of silver is only slightly greater than that of copper, so the latter is generally still used for wires. Enameled wire also has many advantages, the most important being that its surface remains bright and does not easily oxidize. If a large amount of high-frequency current passes through it, such as in the plate circuit of a commercial transmitter, a hollow steel tube should be used, coated with paint to prevent oxidation. This steel tube should not be nickel-plated, as experience has shown that this can increase the high-frequency resistance of the wire by about eight times. Conversely, tin-plating copper tubes does not affect their resistance. At the thickness of ordinary commercial tin-plating, the resistance only increases slightly.</p>
<p>In terms of installation, the coil should be wound tightly to prevent vibration during use, which can change the parameters of the radio. Ribbed coil forms, with appropriate grooves cut into them, can prevent this loosening. Alternatively, grooves can be cut into the form, and the wire wound inside the grooves. If plug-in coils are used, the pins at the bottom of the coil must be firmly attached to prevent them from loosening.</p>
<p>In a shortwave radio, the most troublesome source of loss is the tuning capacitor. This capacitor must have minimal loss, but loss can easily be introduced unless considerable care is taken in selecting this component. Sometimes its high-frequency resistance is even higher than the resistance of the coil it is paired with. In this regard, capacitors with air as the dielectric are the most suitable. Tuning capacitors with paper as the dielectric are completely unsuitable.</p>
<p>Like coils, when a tuning capacitor is connected to the circuit, some of the energy is dissipated within it. First, due to the true leakage loss between the plates, and second, due to the loss generated by the dielectric when the voltage changes.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can regard a tuning capacitor as a pure capacitance, where the current leads the voltage by 90 degrees, and a resistance R with no self-inductance is connected in parallel with it (Figure 2a).</p>
<p>From mathematical calculations, we can transform this parallel resistance R into an equivalent series resistance r, which is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency. At high frequencies, the value of r is extremely small, so we know that most of the loss is absorbed by the dielectric.</p>
<p>The tuning capacitor should have as little dielectric supporting the plates as possible, and this dielectric must be suitable for high frequencies. The metal plates should be made of copper, and each group should be securely fastened. This is very important, because shims are commonly used to fill the space, and if the shims oxidize, the effectiveness will be reduced. The capacitor's rotating shaft must not wobble to avoid noise during rotation.</p>
<p>(3) Tuning Capacitor Values and Other Considerations</p>
<p>To avoid overcrowding the radio spectrum, the capacitance of the tuning capacitor should not be greater than 100 picofarads, i.e., 0.0001 microfarads. The ratio of its maximum to minimum capacitance should be as large as possible, so that the same coil can be tuned to a wider range of wavelengths.</p>
<p>In Figure 3, C and L are the tuning inductance and grid capacitance, and 　 and 　 represent the capacitance between the leads and between the filament and grid. 　 is approximately equal to 5 picofarads, and 　 is approximately equal to 8 picofarads. 　 and 　 can both be considered as being connected in parallel with C.</p>
<p>If a precisely designed capacitor is used as C, with a capacitance of 100 picofarads, then its minimum capacitance is only about 5 picofarads. So the ratio of maximum to minimum capacitance is 183/13, approximately equal to six to one. Using a fixed inductance, the tuning range is approximately two and a half to one. We assume that the tuning range is from 20 meters to 50 meters.</p>
<p>Now, if we use a poorly designed capacitor with a minimum capacitance of 20 picofarads, then the ratio of maximum to minimum capacitance is only 113/33, or 3.4 to 1, reducing the range by almost one point eight to one. So, using a much smaller inductance than before, we can only tune from 20 to 36 meters. Smooth tuning is very important for shortwave reception, and a specially designed dial is used to control it.</p>
<p>Fixed capacitors are no different from those used in broadcast radios, but those with low loss must be used.</p>
<p>Variable coupling can also be used, but this type of coil must be designed with appropriate skill. The contact points must be clean to prevent noise during reception or an increase in resistance after prolonged use. Figure 4 shows a highly effective variable coupling method. Note that the primary, grid, and feedback coils each have several taps that can be matched. This type of coil must be carefully designed, otherwise dead spots may occur, at which points no oscillation can occur.</p>
<p>The pins and base of plug-in coils should have good contact, and the dielectric used for insulation must be suitable for high frequencies. The distance between the pins of the base should be as large as possible to reduce leakage loss.</p>
<p>The inductance of a high-frequency choke coil should be very high, and its self-capacitance should be very small, while its external field should also be very small. Because this type of coil is used to block high-frequency currents in the circuit, a capacitor is also used to shunt this current to ground. To obtain a very high inductance and very small self-capacitance, this choke coil is usually wound in sections and then connected in series. In this way, the inductances are still additive, but the self-capacitance is reduced to a very low level due to the series connection. If the radio components are tightly packed, the choke coil should be shielded to limit the generated electric field.</p>
<p>The dial of the tuning capacitor is very important for reception, so it must be of the slow-motion type. Some amateurs even use a ratio of 100 to 1, but in general, a ratio of 15 to 1 is sufficient.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the radio also depends on whether the regeneration control is appropriate. The capacitor used for control must be free of noise, and it is best to use slow-motion tuning as well. This is even more important for receiving distant radio signals. (End)</p>

<h3>Introduction to the 6A7 Pentagrid Converter Radio</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>The special feature of this radio is that it uses a 6A7 pentagrid converter tube to perform both detection and audio frequency amplification. The former is performed by the tetrode section, and the latter utilizes the oscillator grid and plate sections. The design is very economical, and the results are quite impressive. Listening to local radio stations through the speaker is already satisfactory. At maximum volume, it is approximately equivalent to an ordinary three-tube radio. The selectivity is also quite good. The components are kept to a minimum, and the assembly is compact to make a small and exquisite pocket radio.</p>
<p>Power Supply – This radio uses a 7Z3 for direct power supply type half-wave rectification to provide the 6A7 plate voltage. The filaments of the two vacuum tubes can be connected in series and then connected to the ×× point of the 220V input line via a resistor R3. If you want to be more economical, you can make it a semi-AC type: you only need to find another power transformer with a 6V output on the secondary side to light the 7A7 filament: the B power can be replaced with a 135V dry cell. In practice, the same results can be obtained.</p>

<h3>Method for Converting Regenerative Radio to Automatic</h3>
<p>— Cao Runsheng</p>
<p>A regenerative radio cannot perform at its full potential when regeneration is either too little or too much. If too little, the volume is not high; if too much, only howling is heard and the audio is overwhelmed. The key to automatic regeneration is to adjust the regeneration at the same time as the wavelength, combining two steps into one.</p>
<p>Originally, many radios used a capacitor to control regeneration, so if we used a dual variable capacitor to control the wavelength and regeneration, wouldn't that make it automatic? However, while the theory is correct, in practice, the capacitance of the capacitor used to control regeneration is too large. Because the maximum capacitance of ordinary dual variable capacitors is mostly 0.00035 or 0.00036 MFD, this is suitable for controlling the wavelength, but it is too large for controlling regeneration. When used, one will definitely feel that the regeneration and wavelength cannot be synchronized. Therefore, we also need to connect a fixed capacitor in series to reduce the capacitance. According to the author's experimental results, a capacitance of 0.001 MFD is most suitable. From DC single-tube radios to AC four-tube radios, stable regeneration can be obtained in each wavelength band, and many friends have also tried it and found it to be most suitable.</p>
<p>The circuit diagram above is used on a most common single-tube radio, and it can be similarly installed on various radios. This is just an example!</p>
<p>When using it, first pay attention to the radio station with the shortest wavelength, gradually move the regeneration coil closer to the secondary coil, making the maximum volume about to oscillate but not yet oscillating, then move it back slightly and fix it. In this way, the wavelength and regeneration can be adjusted simultaneously, and it is very stable. Amateurs might as well give it a try.</p>

<h3>Moscow Cracks Down on Street Beggar Children</h3>
<p>— Xing'an</p>
<p>A National News Agency dispatch from the 24th reports that Moscow municipal authorities have recently launched a large-scale crackdown on street beggar children in the city. These beggar children wander everywhere, and their situation is extremely pitiful, having become the most serious problem in Soviet Russian society. It is said that in the past three weeks, Moscow police have searched everywhere and arrested 1,202 homeless children. Some of them have had their parents' residences located, and they were immediately sent back home and their parents warned that they have a responsibility to support their children. As for cases where parents were reprimanded by the police for neglecting the lives of their children, there were as many as 11,300. Street beggar children who are arrested and whose families cannot be found are sent to public institutions to be raised.</p>
<p>From the above facts, we can see that the internal society of Soviet Russia, which practices communism, still has many defects. First, Soviet Russian society is a communist society. However, in this communist society, there are still so many beggar children wandering everywhere, without clothing or food, and their situation is extremely pitiful. This must be said to be one of the biggest defects of communist Soviet Russia, and it is no wonder that it has become the most important problem in Soviet Russian society. Second, in Soviet Russian society, the general public has become more sexually liberated, which has led to a weakening of family concepts and a growing estrangement in the feelings between parents and children. As a result, more than a thousand homeless children and more than ten thousand cases of parents being reprimanded by the police for neglecting the lives of their children have been created. This is also a defect of the communist country of Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>What would these unfortunate children abandoned by society on the streets of Moscow think if they knew that the society they were standing on was a communist country?</p>
<h3>Plum-Flavored Mood</h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>In the season when people change into light, thin shirts, the air also begins to have clouds floating around like vagrants in the human world: diverse, and ever-changing. At that time, without inquiring into the records of the season, everyone understands: what is unfolding in this vast world is no longer the purple, dreamlike spring, but: May, with one or two green plums dotted in the red flower bushes – May brings many alarming unpleasantnesses, and also brings the sour taste that calls to mind the poems of the cuckoo.</p>
<p>(Really, I can't think anymore, I can't think anymore. Every year, when people in the streets show a lighthearted attitude in their spring shirts, and a sharp voice of a plum peddler floats in the deep, long alley, I have already lost the function of thinking, and only a sickly heart remains, panting and dying.</p>
<p>—It's plum-flavored time again. The green sourness will only bring people a kind of painful remembrance of the lost past. But this is only a torment, a punishment, for a person who is not suitable for leisurely thoughts.)</p>
<p>Thinking: When the plums ripen, it will be the time for my own child to go up to the trembling cross of life.</p>
<p>I have already lost the sense of time and space: the only thing I can remember is an image of childhood that emits a silver-flower-like, brilliant light; on it exists the smile of beloved humanity, the sunlight-like, clear heart of the same year, and the orchards dotted in the holy little village (I started to know the plum tree there, and I also started to see her who has already been buried in the pit of memory.) The familiar but not luxurious large rafters in front of the old family gate, the crow's nest residing under the eaves, and many bucolic midsummer evenings.</p>
<p>(But now, this small, peaceful world has been completely destroyed: destroyed in the flames of war, destroyed in famine, destroyed in my own long wandering days...</p>
<p>In the brown-gray memorial, even the most desirable plum flavor and her grass-green voice, make people afraid to think about it.)</p>
<p>The peaceful family house has faced countless storms in the alternation of the times, and the result of poverty and suffering repeatedly attacking the aging generation has finally brought down the fate of the entire generation, just like the plum trees in the orchard. Carrying a small plum-flavored heart, I was pushed out of the peaceful countryside, thrown into the sea of ​​life, drifting and struggling.</p>
<p>However, my child was grown up from the quiet fields, from the plum flavor in the beautiful orchard, from the simple world; and there, I still retain the soul of childhood, and the indelible, gauze-like smile.</p>
<p>When I think of the vast road of life like the sea, the young soul has already lost the courage to live. What I remember is that it was on a May night when the plums were ripe, at the car exhibition in a small town, she said one sentence to me: "Don't pour the sour taste of plums into your heart, the history of life needs courage. When a good era comes, maybe we can come back to see the fullness of the plums."</p>
<p>Yes, the days of suffering will not be without end, "maybe" there will be a day when I will see the leisurely sky of my hometown and the plums in the orchard again?</p>
<p>In that case, I am always living day by day with a plum-flavored mood in the remembrance of the past, and May, which is regarded as a moving season, passes in suffering again and again with the plum flavor. The good days are infinitely far away—perhaps they will flow away forever behind people's backs.</p>
<h3>Early Summer in the Park</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>I. Morning</p>
<p>In the morning, before the sun comes out, the city is still shrouded in a faint, smoky rosy cloud. The streets are quiet, and gusts of cool, late spring wind blow against the chest, still carrying a hint of lingering cold, making people feel that the weather at this time of year is so abnormal.</p>
<p>Stepping into the park, at this moment, apart from the whistling sounds of the wind swaying through the dense treetops and the little birds chirping incessantly with a completely joyful air, seemingly unaware of the desolation or sorrow of the human world, everything is quiet. Most of the people in the city are still in sweet dreams, and the park is covered by an indescribable cool curtain.</p>
<p>The sun, the gentle early summer sun, seems to be like a beautiful and shy girl in her adolescence, smiling coyly as it emerges. The universe is dressed in a vast, bright red veil-like garment. The sunlight climbs onto the lush green treetops, and the birds are singing joyfully, as if celebrating their happiness. The sun gradually moves from the tall treetops to the peaceful meadows, shining on the tranquil lake surface. White spring water pours down the lakeside rocks, gurgling into the lake. The lake surface is also reflected by the red light of the rosy clouds, making even the green shadows of the drooping willows appear particularly beautiful. Countless goldfish swim and frolic on the water surface, creating circles of tiny ripples. Here, everything in the morning park is so beautiful and lovely.</p>
<p>II. Happy People</p>
<p>Gradually, the park is adorned with a continuous stream of visitors, with no more tranquility, no more birds singing, and no more lingering cold – the park is filled with the scent of early summer everywhere. From the moment the sun's light turns white and gradually hangs high in the sky, until dusk when the sun seems to breathe wearily as it sets in the west, the park is noisy, with no trace of tranquil poetic charm. What the eyes can see, apart from the colors of the lush green trees, are groups of women dressed in spring and summer clothes, made up so charmingly, and the debauchery of young men. In the distance, people are chasing after such crowds. Ah! This is a time filled with the intense scent of youth! Young people are all equally moved by the adorable and beautiful shadows.</p>
<p>Apart from the whispers of young couples, apart from the faces revealing the thirst of the times, and apart from those who seem oblivious to the bleakness of the era, reveling as if in a frenzy, we can see groups of children wearing beautiful red and green clothes playing and chatting on the beach, running on the verdant meadows, their joyful mood adding infinite color to the park.</p>
<p>III. Dusk</p>
<p>The sun must truly be tired, having hung in the high, azure sky for so long. Now, it gently disappears behind the treetops. A desolate red sunset, a scene truly different from the morning's atmosphere, gradually departs from the human world.</p>
<p>Groups of people gradually leave the park. When the pitch-black night occupies the universe, the park reveals a terrifying, unclear, and blurred picture, vast and expansive. Poets should be writing poems under the lamplight in their houses, and revelers in the city should be turning upside down in sweet dreams.</p>
<p>But alas! The park is as if dead, with no sign of youth.</p>
<h3>Returning Home at Night</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>The night is still, the sky is still, and the air is still.</p>
<p>Saturday night, a day deeply etched in one's heart, a day that stirs excitement!</p>
<p>The standard clock on North Sichuan Road tells you it's already 3:15. Green clouds, pregnant with impending movement. Drunken sailors, humming disorderly tunes. Aren't they? The red lights are eerily glaring. At some point, you might find them annoying, but at this moment, on this unforgettable Saturday night, they seem to possess a different kind of power, piercing into everyone's eyes. The differently colored words above the doors of taverns and dance halls especially compel your weary heart.</p>
<p>Once past the Sichuan Road Bridge, you can't help but relax your excited mood. There, you find no stimulation, and what you encounter is only dead silence.</p>
<p>Time runs incessantly. In front of the Huiluo Company, the road lying across is like a snake, resting peacefully, its back oily black, emitting lazy light.</p>
<p>Risen Sun Building, such a familiar name. Intersecting train tracks crisscross. Several anxious cars constantly ask, "Taxi, do you need one?" This inevitably becomes annoying to those who are used to walking. The atmosphere of depression surrounds every heart. Under duress, he can't help but ask, but who can understand? Even those with relatively decent attire are suffering the same pain, constantly struck by this suffering.</p>
<p>A small shed, close to the train tracks. Several small red lights are placed separately, the firelight projecting around the shed, a grand spectacle!</p>
<p>Legs, a little sore. Heels, swollen! Is it inhumane? Finally, the taxi pulls me away. The driver's legs, so strong. The taxi runs on the snakelike road, so crisp! In the quiet night, the sound waves easily rush into your eardrums.</p>
<p>A bend, a road, passes quickly. Kissing the chilling wind, it turns into a street with exotic flavor. Straight and upright, the lights are neither too many nor too few, the brightness just right. The circles of light cast on the smooth road are very round. The trees on the sidewalk, sprouting verdant leaves, are assaulted by the wind, rustling softly.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, my eyes closed, my body bumping along with the driver's footsteps. Gradually, a layer of chaos wells up in my heart, my consciousness beginning to blur.</p>
<p>"Suddenly," the taxi stopped. Sweat beads streaming from his forehead. Needless to say, his face was flushed red. He looked at me, giving a knowing smile. I touched my pocket, added a few more coppers, rubbed my eyes, and thought to myself:</p>
<p>—Ah, another day has been whiled away.</p>

<h3>Spring at the Inn</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>Although it is said that the times have moved with flying steps to the cutting edge of the twentieth century. The twentieth century, in prosperous metropolises, is said to be a world of machines, a world of electricity, and a world suitable for enjoyment and convenience! It's spring, and there we can imagine: streamlined, high-speed automobiles speeding along glass-smooth streets; mechanical boats racing in the water like a line; the metropolises of the twentieth century, even the natural objects in the wild – this blue-purple mist-shrouded mountain, this stream as soft as a girl's affection – have all been washed by science: only there does true modernity, the true twentieth century, reside.</p>
<p>Really! If you, like us, were to visit some of the impoverished and ancient villages located in the remote north, hire a skinny nag, and walk wearily on the endless, long, and desolate sandy road for an entire day, until the sun is setting (at which time, the prosperous metropolis is just beginning to bustle), fearing bandits and wild dogs on the dark road, you would have to quickly find a dilapidated and ancient inn to settle down, and then, under the light of the oil lamp at night, listen to the old sighs and sorrows of various people. You would surely forget the progress of the times and have a medieval feeling of desolation.</p>
<p>Under the drifting nature of business, we once again agreed to make a long-distance tour. When we left, it was a picture-perfect spring in Jiangnan; there were brocade-like flowers, and people as beautiful as flowers, but in this good season, we carried cloth, medicine, Mei Foo lamps, sugar, soap, and other daily necessities, drifting aimlessly to this remote small village in the north.</p>
<p>It was already the picturesque third month of spring! But there, we still felt the biting, desolate wind; on a dim evening, several people sat in sedan chairs, slowly walking on the silky-smooth sandy road. That kind of image is difficult to describe; and then, dusk fell as quickly as lightning. When the distant bald mountains turned into ghostly black shadows in the vastness, we had already found a place to rest in the "Bao Family Old Inn," marked with "Officials, Merchants, Guests, Welcome," and were drinking cool spring wine under the only few yellow-tinged-red Mei Foo kerosene lamps in the entire village.</p>
<p>The inn was the most elaborate in the village, even more so than "Bao Family's": people gathered in a large, undivided room called the "guest hall," where the brick bed had no fire underneath, because it was spring. Yes; the weather warmed up, and there was less fire on the brick bed, but the room had more of an unpleasant musty smell. That kind of smell constantly smoked people, and people would have a disgusting discomfort. Two kerosene lamps hanging on opposite corners of the room emitted black smoke on one side, while emitting a dull yellow light on the other, illuminating the wine-flushed faces of the guests. People gathered in twos and threes under the lamps, playing paper-cutting games, lamenting the hardships of old age, talking about famine years, discussing the harvests of wheat and sorghum, and talking about the market prices of bird's-eye satin...</p>
<p>Containing unclear voices numbed by the burning liquor, what was represented were all the dissatisfactions of the locals and outsiders, cursing, sighing, arguing; mouths moved, and hands moved too. Another night came in turmoil; it is difficult for people to be stable in suffering, just like a wildfire in the north wind.</p>
<p>But when half the kerosene in the lamp burned out, and the light went from dim to extinguished, the people all lay scattered on the ground, snoring messily. A gust of wind swept through the paper window: the third month of spring in the north carried a musty smell, like a rotten Middle Ages...</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Lianhua News</h3>
<p>"National Style," which the Chinese people eagerly desire, is Lianhua's biggest film of the year. Written by Luo Mingyou and co-directed by Luo Mingyou and Zhu Shilin, it is Ruan Lingyu's last masterpiece before her death. This film will be released soon.</p>
<p>Sun Yu has decided to adapt "The Admirable Crichton" as his new work after "The Big Road," but he intends to change the title to "Go to Nature."</p>
<p>"Tianlun" (Grand Destiny) is Lianhua's most ambitious special production of the year. Naturally, the completion of this film requires a lot of money and time.</p>
<p>Lin Chuchu has been very busy lately. The work on "National Style" has just finished, and there are still many scenes to be filmed for "Tianlun," and now she is also acting in Wu Yonggang's "Little Angel."</p>
<p>Li Lili and Luo Peng are the best dancers and have made great contributions with their "feet" in "National Style."</p>
<p>Wang Renmei said to George, the director of "Little Angel," "We will be filming sound films soon, so you should quickly learn Mandarin." He said, "I won't learn Mandarin, I will learn the national language."</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng is preparing to write for Lianhua's newspaper and magazine for a long time. His "A Day's Dream of the Windy Pavilion" collection will be published continuously from the fifth volume, tenth issue onwards.</p>
<p>Because Lianhua is concentrating on film production, expanding the photography studios, and increasing the number of directors, a new strong general has joined the directorial team. He is Wang Cilong, who has a long history and great achievements in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaozhong said: "'Four Sisters' are four women with different personalities. Their experiences are also different."</p>
<p>While filming Luo Peng's engagement and betrothal in "Cold River Setting Sun," it rained heavily. Diao Banhua braved the rain to offer his congratulations.</p>
<p>All of Lianhua's work is very intense, and the translation department is also editing the "Lianhua Yearbook" for 1934.</p>
<p>"An Ill-Fated Marriage" starring Helen Hayes and Montgomery is playing in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Star Gossip</h3>
<p>"National Soul" (Zhang Shichuan and Li Pingqian's two groups) began filming a few days ago, with sets of battlefields and the entrance of Wang Xianqi's mansion.</p>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company has recently purchased another truck, worth more than two hundred and fifty taels of silver, specifically for transporting furniture at the photography studios.</p>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company has now decided to move to its new location at Fenglin Bridge in early May, so the company has begun to move there step by step in recent days.</p>
<p>Shen Xiling's minor illness has healed, and "Boat Woman" has continued filming. It can be concluded after about one or two more scenes.</p>
<p>Ye Qiuxin plays a female student in "National Soul," with a very calm expression.</p>
<h3>Songs in "Night Fragrance"</h3>
<p>Cheng Bugao's new film "Night Fragrance" is a sad love story. It contains the song "Night Fragrance," sung by Hu Die. The lyrics are sad and lingering, very moving. The song was composed by Yan Gongshang and written by Wang Qianbai, and has been recorded by Pathé. The lyrics of the song are recorded below:</p>
<p>"Selling night fragrance!</p>
<p>Selling night fragrance!</p>
<p>(Selling night fragrance ah.)</p>
<p>The flowers are good,</p>
<p>White and fragrant,</p>
<p>The fragrance of flowers does not last long,</p>
<p>People fear old age,</p>
<p>Pearls fear yellowing,</p>
<p>Flowers also fear not lasting long!</p>
<p>Flower lovers, come and buy quickly,</p>
<p>Don't wait until tomorrow when the flowers are no longer fragrant,</p>
<p>Buying flowers won't cost you much money,</p>
<p>Selling flowers is good for supporting parents.</p>
<p>Selling night fragrance!</p>
<p>Selling night fragrance!</p>
<p>Selling night fragrance ah!"</p>
