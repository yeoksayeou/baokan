<h3 id="c13">工商業復興之曙光 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>上海市商會前日舉行第六屆會員代表大會。通過要案二十件。中以設立工商業復興委員會。調查衰落原因。研究復興計畫一案最爲重要。雖提案之內容如何。不得而知。但望文生義。亦有以知其爲當今切要之舉也。</p>
<p>上海工商業本有其光榮之歷史。重大之使命。其一言一動。常爲天下先。今出而謀復興。多少必有成效可睹。惟上海自經一二八戰事之後。外受世界經濟潮流之激盪。內受農村經濟破產之影響。致造成今日之局面。幸賴各方協力。得維危局。然而外來之經濟侵略。非但未嘗斂其鋒。且復變本加厲。方興未艾。我欲謀提高關稅。聊以保衛工商於萬一。事未見諸實行。而責言已至。爲欲防杜白銀之出口。則東偷西漏。查不勝杳。緝無可緝。辦理稍一疏忽。而交涉以起。舉凡正當防衛。在今日情形之下。尙且欲行而不可得。夫復何言。卽如中法越南商約。不知歷多少年月。方得告成。條約內容自屬互利。但如法殖民部長羅蘭之報告。則謂「於法國頗有利益。東京日煤與越南產米。今後較易於向中國推銷矣。」夫如安南煤米推銷盡利。中國煤米必將受其打撃。此爲必然之事也。再觀五個月來棉布進口。東貨居其大半。英貨僅及東貨之半。其他史不足齒。又標紗市塲。華商尙苦虧本。外商幾日有售出。此其故何　。又如煤米二者。若各國皆援最惠國待遇相要求。將如何應付。如准共援用。則暹羅仰光之米。臼本撫順之媒。皆源源而來矣。凡此不過略舉一二。其他類於此者。更僕難數。故時人嘗思摹倣外國成規。以爲本國復興之計。其用心良苦。但如統制進口貿易。姑不論如何統制。人如挾其兵艦武裝租界碼頭之便利。不受我統制將奈何。管理匯兌誠善矣。姑不論實力若何。但爲金融歷史之關係。設有不能推行盡利之處。又爲之奈何。蓋惟識病方可下藥。如藥雖良而病情不明。或用藥過其量。皆足以致命。今市商會謀復興工商業能從調查入手。是亦用藥先求識病也。病情旣明。治療自易。若但知投以成藥。而不顧病情之虛實。其危殆亦可立覩。</p>
<p>善夫商會主席俞佐庭氏之言曰。「以全國號稱首屈一指之市塲。而日在風雨飄搖呼籲求助之中。此亦大會之恥也。」今商會同人能以知恥相自勵。調查爲工具。復興爲目的。是亦孔子所謂「好學近乎知。力行近乎仁。知恥近乎勇」也。雖然。孔子又言。「知斯三者。則知所以修身。知所以修身。則知所以洽人。知所以治人。則知所以治天下國家矣。」深望人人能有知恥之心。好學力行。以求我整個民族之復興。豈僅工商數業而已哉。</p>

<p>交通部郵政儲金匯業總局、創辦京滬漢三處之簡易人壽保險刻正積極籌備、總局保險屬內部亦擴充範圍、增設三股、並定期辦理工作服務人員訓練、一俟囤積居奇壽險章程核準後、卽行正式開辦、茲經大公社記者探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>三處聯絡進行</p>
<p>國營簡易人壽保險前經交通部令節郵政儲金匯業總局、先籌設上海·南京·漢口·三處、然後再推廣全國、上海方面除由總局與上海郵政管理局、在南市·閘北·法租界·公共租界·等各重要區域之分局、會同籌備外、復分令南京儲匯分局、與江蘇區郵政管理局、漢口儲匯分局、與江蘇區郵政管理局、漢口儲匯分局、與湖北區郵政管理局、聯絡進行籌備、在每一分局內先行設立簡易人壽保險部、至分局以下之支局等、暫緩辦理、</p>
<p>內部範圍擴充</p>
<p>郵政儲金匯業總局之保險處、內部組織原祇一股、辦理各種通常保險及郵件保險事宜、茲為添設囤積居奇人壽保險關係、因事務繁劇、應會不易故特增設三股、規定第一二三股專門處理簡易壽險事務、及通常保險、第四股則為郵件包裹等保險、各股已於上星期內成立、辦事人員亦酌量增加、</p>
<p>訓練服務人員</p>
<p>簡易壽險事業、係我國草創、完全國家經營、與普通公司洋行所辦之保險、蛋白質不同、手續方面及內部組織、甚複雜、儲匯總局為養成担任該項業務之人員起見、特規定京滬漢三處、每分局內由現任郵政與儲匯之職員中、抽調一人或兩人、加以短期訓練、地點定於上海總局內、現已着手籌備開班、俟該批服務員訓練成熟後、間接担任訓練支局人員、</p>
<p>七一不及實行</p>
<p>關於簡易人壽保險正式開始期、交通部原擬七月一日起實　、昨據保險處副處長張明昕云、簡易壽險法、經立法院通過、由國府公布後、本局擬訂章程七十五條、呈請交通部核示去後、交部依法定程序、轉呈行政院、迄今尚未核準批下、同時各處籌備手續複雜、頗費時間、故預計須於八月初旬方可實行云、</p>

<p>— （波光）</p>
<p>現代一般靑年學子，掮着求學的招牌做幌子，天天上舞塲，瞧電影，談戀愛把父母的血汗金錢，儘管　擲，毫不痛惜。數年以後，弄到一張畢業文憑，欺騙父母；欺騙自己；欺騙良心—學府中的黑語，在國內大學畢業的呌做「鍍銀」；出洋留學的喚爲「鍍金」—可是用功勤讀的也有，總是少數。</p>
<p>提倡國貨的呼聲，喊得鎭天價響，據海關的報告，依然洋貨入超，顯見國人崇拜洋貨的心理太堅。有某甲出品精美化妝品一種，竭力宣傳，仍是滯銷。以後把它改裝仿洋，居然深得一般摩登婦女樂用，不脛而走，某甲美其名曰「鍍金」，意謂摩登婦女只知盲從，不辨貨之好歹，可謂謔而虐矣。</p>

<p>— 蕉心</p>
<p>有甲乙兩個人，他們身邊都備着兩種香烟，一種是好的，一種楚壞的。甲把好的敬客，壞的留着自己吸：乙却適得其反，把壞的敬客，好的留着自己吸。我看了莫朋其妙，便去問甲，他的答案是：</p>
<p>「把壞的敬客，未免太寒酸，更免不了給人笑話：自己吃壞的，雖然苦了自己，但是總不會人家笑我寒酸，所以我寗呵把好的敬客，壞的自己吃。」</p>
<p>我又去問乙，乙的理由也很充分：</p>
<p>「香烟敬客是很平凡的事，你把好的來敬客，人家未必見得就感謝你，樂得把好的自己受用。」</p>
<p>我覺得甲乙兩君的話，各有理由。後來又遇見了丙君，他也楚備有兩種香烟的，可是他並不一定把那一種敬客，是因客而異的，我又去問他是什麼即由，他說：</p>
<p>「地位高過我的敬好香烟，不如我的就不客氣敬壞香烟了；至於自己呢，錢多了吸好的，錢少了就吸壞的。」</p>
<p>聽了丙君的話，再把甲乙兩君的話互相比較一下，丙君的辦法又精明得多了</p>
<p>吃香烟本來是一件小事，想不到却含着很深的　世哲學！</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>前天、吾在張姓喜筵上，碰着一位老翁，佗年紀已近古稀了；席間還有兩個少年，穿着西式的服表，滿口大講其收音機裏的申曲時調，那一個好　那一個壞，說來，眞覺得津津有味；老翁聽了，默不作聲，不停的擎着酒盃喝。一手把筷像雨點般的儘張着嘴吃，後來兩個少年，也講　了，有人問一位老翁，說：你老先生歡喜聽無綫電收音機麼？老翁撚了一把雪白的嘴鬚，笑容可掬的答道：我有幾種音最不歡喜聽，不過說出來，恐怕要得罪諸位呢！</p>
<p>兩少年看他老氣橫秋，有意要請老翁說出，老翁祇得不客氣，說：唉，我老了，非但收音機聽不懂什麼？，不歡喜聽，就是極妙的音樂相歌曲，也厭煩不耐，這是我的特性了；還有不但不歡喜聽，而且聽着要萬分的呵惡，是什麼幾種音呢！像半夜裏的劈劈拍拍打牌聲，隔壁鄉隣人家的相罵聲，和時光已到了午飯時候，還有人寢息在牀時作鼾睡聲，那未：我聽着，眞恨不得要教訓他們，責備他們，什麼緣故呢？因爲這幾種音，都違背着眼前生活的道理；說罷還指着兩少年襟上掛的藍地白文甆徽，說：這是什麼東西？原來是實行新生活的標織：弄得兩少年反而面紅起來，露着有些慚愧樣子，無地自容了。</p>
<p>歇了一回，一少年憤憤地請問老翁，然則老先生也有歡喜聽的晉麼？那老翁說有、在家裏，我最歡喜聽老妻在廚房間，開油鍋聲，眞像八音琴一樣，或拿靑菜放入鍋裏，綽辣一響，好似石破天驚，這不楚極好聽的音麼？在外河旁邊和水擠頭，有幾個少婦，拿了一根木棒，不斷的搗衣，拍蹋拍蹋的聲，震蕩到兩岸，有時竟在淸晨裏，會警醒他人的酣夢，這種音實在聽之不厭啊！兩少年聽老翁這樣說，曉得他是諷已，也不覺肅然起敬，拱着手說：老先生的話，眞是不錯，我聽了這一席話，不能不把他記起來，以獻給讀者們看。</p>

<p>這時志前說破了，倒是教他無詞呵措，紅了臉，將頭　低若。志前道：人類同情心，那總是有的，你剛才這股子義憤，本來不能說錯。不過你沒有加以考慮　了。北海更是沒有話說，見桌上放了一輕舊報紙，隨便拿起來一份，就兩手捧了看。志前坐着默然了一　。就笑道：其實，這也無須過慮，他們這買賣，决對的做不成。北海道：那是什麼原故？志前道：他們三代，兩個寡婦，一個姑娘，由甘肅逃難到這地方來，也已經逃過去了。豈有到了這可討到飯吃的所在再來骨肉分離之理？北海道：我也是這樣想。不過這買賣不成，那個胡小明家裏，也不會再　他三個人件住下去的；那時他們到　裏去安身？他說到這裏，眞是肯替人家發愁，放下報，背了兩手，就在屋子裏走來走去。志前也不加以擱阻儘管讓他去着急他。正楚這樣走着的時候，一眼看到楊浣花怱怱的由窗子外經過，分明是在胡小脚家裏，已經得有了結果，這是向賈多才報告去。那末，這件事算是成功了，突然的轉過身來，就要向門外走去。但同時也看到稈志前在一邊微笑着，又立刻把那要衝出房門去的樣子，收拾起　。志前笑道：剛才那位楊小姐由窗子外過去了，你倒是可以去向仲打聽一點消息。志前說破了，他更顯着臉顯帶了，　　　的樣了，因笑道：他們的事，也值不得我這樣的去留心。（二四八）</p>

<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>華僑仕日本以橫濱東京最多，不是開設雜貨店，便是國飯店茶館。其他營業，很難和日人競爭，故不多見。日本稱菜肴爲料理，中國　館個稱中華料理。此種華僑大抵原籍北平山東寗波廣東等處，尤以寗波最多。東京各區，無處沒有他們的營業。同爲中華料理，調味方法，也各不相同。北方菜館，大都有包子饅頭出售，調味也、脫辛辣葱蒜的氣味，南方館子，着重零碎菜肴，中華麵和燒買是出名的</p>
<p>凡是吃過中華料理的日本人，沒有不讚美中國人調味手段的高明。雖是終日吃便當（即飯匣了）的勞丁，時常要約了朋友去嘗一次中華麵。日華報紙雜誌上也常有中華料理的調味指導。但多楚菜館的調味方法，不合家常食用，日本人昭着他嘗試的，並不多的。所謂中華麵者，就是中國普通的湯麵。上面放着幾片薄如火腿的肉片，和幾　台灣竹筍，價約角，利益不小。燒買相我國不同，乃是肉屑白菜等做成的丸子，外而包着麵粉，成爲圓形。因爲肉屑很少，成本又輕故角錢可買四五個。</p>
<p>日本人學了我國調味法的皮毛，便也　店競爭，掛着中華料理招牌。並此在門口還放着一個紹興酒甕，上面有五彩的圖畫，表示不能做中國菜的標語。此種空酒甕，在舊貨店中出售，每們達元八角之鉅。中國菜館館裏都自中國　出售，像五茄皮，燒洒，黃酒，等，每甕海關稅在四五以上，故定價很貴。並目酒味又較日本酒爲釅，來嘗試的不多。此外有南瓜子，西瓜子大靑梅，松花皮蛋等，陳列在櫥窗裏，加上錫製的暖鍋，壽字蠟台，那裏想到身居　國呢。</p>
<p>在留學生最多的神田區，中華菜銷更多了。店內坐滿了中國學生，立着待坐位的，容不下而退出的也有。同是中國人，因了省籍不同，言語不通，只得用日語談話，這是我們感覺得最困苦的事情，但是日本言語也不統一，東京人和長崎人講話，中間也需要一個翻譯呢。</p>
<p>留學生有一種特殊的包飯，名曰定食，每餐約兩角，碗菜，碗湯，雖然簡單異吊，比生而且冷的日本菜要高明不少，到了日本沒有大塊的肉吃，是一個嚴電問題，日人喜吃野菜魚類，所以肉店不多價亦很貴。聽說日本殺豬—分外行，用棒把豬打死了，然後剝去其皮，好像殺牛。所以豬肉上，確　沒有皮的。還有我國認爲名貴的腰子和脚，他們都不要吃。於是中門菜館便有許多便宜貨，豬脚角錢可得四隻，所以二角錢的定食，也可吃一次豬脚了。</p>
<p>全席菜肴約自八元起至—左右不等，除了中華　宴會之外，日本人是不　請教的，一種原因是價格太貴，第二是日本人是分食制，　許多人圍　大嚼，是不慣常的。</p>

<h3 id="c210">論果戈理的描寫方法 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>讀了二十二日自山談上定君底一果戈理的關於　寫人物的話」那篇文章，使我也有同樣的脾想。確實的，果戈理介紹人物出場時，那種「小說作法」似的意見，是會使作品的完整和統一受到相當的影響的。然而，奇怪的，却是我們讀到外套，鼻子和死靈魂時，却並不覺得他底作品，因此而支離破碎。反而覺得因此增加了他那人物更廣大的社會性的氣分。這確是值得我們深深地思索一番的。</p>
<p>本來在舊寫實主義的文學裏，這種把人物描寫了一會以後，或把人物抬出塲的當兒，由作者自已拋頸露面來說話的寫法，是很普遍的。比如，紅樓夢一開頸使說，「此開卷第一回也，接着又把這書的產生原因，說了一大套；又如，唐吉訶德先生傳，和阿Q正傳第一章裏，就全是一套是眞非眞的閒話。作書的人多像說書的人似的，坐在高橙子上靠着一張桌子，把　木拍了一下，哩哩哆哆說了下去，那麼個態度和神氣。有時，且如中國舊通俗小說，在故事進展到中途，來一套一看官們什麼什麼」的閒話。——那些閒話，大都是作者底感想或議論——在我請到這些個地方，常是用那種舊寫實主義的特徵：所謂故事的平面的發展，塲面的靜態的開展，來作解答的。而這秤舊寫實主義的特徵和手法，又似乎可追源到一切小說演義之類，從封建社會裏的口頭流傳與演述，到印刷業發達時搬上書本裏來，這一個嬗變上。所以它無論怎麼脫離不了那種說書人的態度，來從事寫作。一到寫小說的人離那個口頭演述的時代漸漸遠了，（雖然在社會裏還存在着說書的人，比如像中國說大鼓書之類。）文學作品也漸漸成爲非通俗的讀物了，作品的嚴肅性就</p>
<p>點點增加起來，作品中的人物底出現，和塲面底展開，就由作品的本身來活動，作者全隱在書本後面，不露絲毫面目。這手法是很容易捉住讀者，使他融合在作品裏面，跟作品中人物聞其悲哀與快樂。這在文學作品的演進史上，是中外例的。果戈理作品中，由自己出面這個挿話，大致也有這一個因素布裏面。但他那些挿話，和他作品那麼地調和融合，那又涉及他底作風問題了。</p>
<p>就我所讀過的果戈理底作品講請：如巡按，外套和鼻子，那大都可說是屬於諷刺文學這一類裏的。但他底諷刺文學，有和其他諷刺文學不同。一般的諷刺文學作者善於在文字中裝飾着尖銳的針刺，樣子是露骨的；很容易使被諷刺奢，皮肉受傷。果戈理的諷刺，却把作品的本身和諷刺台致起來。整個作品就是一把劍與刀，一枝板槍與匕首。比如拿鼻子來說吧！吃麵包吃出了鼻子來，七等文官找鼻子竟找到坐在馬車上三等文官身上去。又如拿巡按來說吧，迎接一個巡按，竟把旅店裏一個旅客迎接了來，且把自已女兒賠貼了出去。就故事講，眞可謂荒唐極了。眞可謂不合理極了。然而透過這荒唐的故事，透過這不合理的描寫，却使讀者見到極其眞實的一面。而終於把一柄冰冷的匕首，深深地放進讀奢的心裏；使讀者怎麼也抵受不住，哭笑不得。果戈理的作者，一直到現在，還那麼地受讀者歡迎，這里就存在他的原因。因爲眞實是一切文學的生命。我們在果戈印作品中，是看到了將要沒落的地主階級（如他那一老式地主」中所描寫的）和爛腐的貴挨階級底活生生的死靈了。</p>
<p>可是，事實上，果戈理本人，又是屬於貴族的地主階級的。他對於自己的這一階級裏的人物，雖然十分增惡，但他也無法使他自己擺脫這一階級的本質的氣分。（比如，他在「老式地主」中所描寫的，完全以十分憐憫與同情的態度，來描寫阿弗奈西一。公公，和「伯利海理亞一媽媽底死亡。）而他要把這些可憎惡的人物描寫出來時，他於是不得不用曲筆，來避免事實上的麻煩。因之，他造出了極其荒誕不經的故事，來掩閉現實的眞面目。（實際上，現實的眞面目，越因他這巧妙的掩閉法，越透出光芒來。）故事旣那麼地荒誕不經了。那麼在文體的發展上，也就不得不用出格的手法；他是特地把自己扮做小丑，鼻子上抹一條白粉，說出套悲凉的笑話來的。所以我們談外套和死靈魂時，雖然他不時地挿上一大段一大段的閒話，而我們還覺得那作品是融和的，統一的，整個的。那就在於他出格的手法手法形式－與荒誕的故事——內容——十分合致的緣故。</p>
<p>在今日的中國，似乎頗需要有能運用像果戈理那樣手法的作者，因爲我們面對着的現實，是個非當艱難的時代。我寫下這一篇短文，雖然動機楚爲了解答辜定君的沒有結果的思索，而意思却在告訴中國的現實主義的作家們，在那無法下筆的時，來學一學果戈理的乖！</p>
<h3 id="c211">我也來談談衛生臭豆腐乾 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>知堂老人不滿意目前各種毛刊物上常見的科學小品，他把這類小品文比做衛生吳豆腐乾。自然。有些小品文好比臭豆腐乾。但未必便是科學小品說起臭豆腐亁。好像是各地都流行的，但我總覺得只有出在長沙的好，我敢發誓，不是替牠宣傳，何况我也只是偶然買牠一點嘗嘗，自己並不曾把牠當飯吃。未必長沙的汕炸豆腐便楚妙味，只因牠　我的脾胃相投，就算好了，衛生不衛生的計較，倒在共次。知堂老人也愛吃臭豆腐乾。而且只說公安竟陵兩家的好，各有脾胃，悉聽尊便。可是他老人家一定要把公安竟陵兩家的貨色介紹給大家，像賣糖的說糖甜，賣酒的說酒好，著成專書，作爲廣告。就未免犯了推銷衛生臭豆腐乾的嫌疑了。</p>
<p>還有，知堂老人是相信命運的。他說：「我近來很有點相信命運。那麼難道我竟去請教某師某星士，要他指點我的流年或終身的吉凶麼？那也未必。這些要知道，我自己都呵以知道。因爲知道自己無過於自己。我相信命運，所憑的不楚吾家易經神課，却楚人家的科學術數　我說命，這就是個人的先天的質地，今云遺傳。我說運，是後天的影響，今云環境　一從來的命運論只是臭豆腐乾，以知堂老人之聖且智，難道他還不知道麼？他要相信命運論，他得做到西式改良，特別衛生。他把西洋生物學家關於遺傳與環境的學說「歪曲二下，就成了他的新命運論。他倡新命運論要根據，科學術數」。這也像賣臭豆腐乾的要標榜「衛生」了我以爲可以喻作衛生臭豆腐乾的，是所謂「科學術數的命運論　「科學靈乩」之類。但未必便楚科學小品。</p>

<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>三面圍着山。太陽的火舌頭從山峰間撩下來。烤死了山腰上鮮綠的草，山麓下的水潭也被火舌頭捲舐乾了。</p>
<p>山城的市街。像現在一隻火燙的大蒸鍋裏。</p>
<p>本來是沒有水的地方，現在對於水的問題更吃緊了。</p>
<p>山脚下四眼洞的大泉井，一到午後就沒有水，然而裝水車，挑水桶的水夫還是一批批爭先恐後的來吊、大木桶在深得像無底的井洞裏幌着，幌過好多時，吊上來小半桶黃泥水。黃泥水還是人家搶着。</p>
<p>淮水的河牀一層層暴露在太陽光下，去挑水的水夫要從很高的岸上走下一層層灘去，走到水灘上，水還只有一薄片，大木桶舀不起來。河床中心當然還有很大的水，風浪，人走下水站不住；於是淮水邊上有人　開窟，十多隻大擔桶輪換着在新開的大水窟里挑上一擔擔黃泥水。</p>
<p>上山去喝茶，老道士告訴我們山泉已經乾了：看一個孩子在深的石坳裏把小匙子舀着泥水，舀了好久，舀不上半　、泥水也舀不起來了。</p>
<p>大家一致的心思盼着天下雨，前幾天下雨了，然而雨不大，不够事，井里還只有泥污水吊上來。</p>
<p>山城的夏天，眞再不能住下去；黃昏上走上街去，街上騰着一股刺鼻管的酸臭味。</p>
<p>赤着身，一絲不掛的孩子一起起　路上跑來跑去，污黑的身體上像起了銹斑紋，也許有一年半載沒洗過澡吧！</p>
<p>夜上露宿在門外的老老少少躺得滿街；赤膊着展覽在月亮光下。</p>
<p>從白　街上一聯隊一聯隊的泥水水桶一直看到晚上滿街赤膊的展覽會，這地方將使你不敢再留住下去。</p>

<p>但娜　已經不在大當內，其他的女孩子都站在她們的母親旁邊，她們的母親正把她們底肩帶和髮帶結束端整。波力嘉太太正帶了淸凉飲料走進門來；她也沒有看見她的女兒。現在我就去尋找弗里茨，他站在房角音樂棹子旁邊，把空杯子斟滿。「娜脫在那裏？」我問。</p>
<p>「我不知道，」他滿臉不高興地回答：「她剛才沉默得像啞吧樣，我不曉得是甚麼緣故。」</p>
<p>我拉着他跑出走廊來；當我們走過那個安放客人外套的房開時候，就碰到了她；她已經穿好了外套，把那條黑綢頸布蒙在頭上。「娜麗！」我减，拌去抓她的手，但她擺脫了她的手，從我們身邊走過去。</p>
<p>「不要囉唆！」她簡單說了一句，「我要回家去！」</p>
<p>祗一會兒後，她就把通向大街那個沉重的門用力拉開，并帶蹤帶跳地出到門外，從　　杆旁邊走下台階去。當弗里茨跟隨　也走到大門外時候，她已經在大街上走遠了，我們在黑暗中祇能看見她那飛跑的影子。</p>
<p>「讓她去吧！」弗里茨說，「難道你有興趣要去追逐野鵝麼？」</p>
<p>我却是有這個興趣的：但我不知道應不應當這樣做。—我們祇好回到堂內來。波力嘉太太有事回到她家裏去，但事情未曾做完又走回來了，—說是娜麗身　欠安，已經睡在床上，媽的父親坐在　旁邊。</p>

<p>羅菲走進某某公司的經理室中，她是來應徵的。經理問她話：</p>
<p>「你呌羅菲麼？」</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「啊，密斯羅，羅小姐，你二十幾歲了？」</p>
<p>「二直三歲。」</p>

<p>「羅小姐貴府是蘇州啊。」</p>
<p>其實，羅菲的年齡，籍貫，還有履歷，早都淸淸楚楚寫在應徵信上了，問不問都是這一套話。</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「啊，蘇州，我才想起來，蘇州出美人哪。」摸一摸八字鬍。「怪不得羅小姐，哈哈哈，你長得這樣美。果然名不虛傳。」說到這裏，轉過話頭又裝作很止經的樣子問道：「你打字打得打麼，羅小姐？」</p>
<p>羅菲點點頸。她不知怎樣回話好。她只是覺得經理的兩只眼睛像兩枝箭，對準她預備放射，他的話也說得很輕薄，她心裏　急，臉就紅了一陣。</p>
<p>「害羞麼？眞好，眞美。」</p>
<p>經理更進一步歪着頭緊緊釘着她，端相着，接着又問道：一你結過婚麼？」</p>
<p>「我？——遲些時，「我還沒有定婚呢。」</p>
<p>「那麼你是眞正小姐了，哈哈，好極了，好極了。」</p>
<p>羅菲窘極，眞覺得是她有生以來第一次受別人的奚落，而她是從不讓人的，現在爲了求業，也只有委屈求全不與別人計較這些了。羅菲有一時恨不急得一下子立起身跑出經理室，找到在江邊碼頭上等她的陸文，——她的丈夫——抱住他大哭一塲。她生氣，止不住鄭里其事　說：</p>
<p>「經理先生，請你少說點題外話好不好？」</p>
<p>「題外話？哈哈。」仲手又把那油光光的頭髮摸了一把。一可不能這樣說，我道是試騐你是大方—你忙什麼，多坐一會還不好麼？我看你人很好，啊，是的，人很好，你打打字看看罷。」</p>
<p>羅甚走到打字機旁邊坐下了，伸出手，預備聽經理的吩咐。</p>

<p>「啊，好極了，我說了，聽，開頭了。——朋友，昨天你爲什麼失約不來？你不來不要緊，累得我久等實在不該。啊，我想起來了，大約你是讓那位密絲緾住了吧？你那位密斯，確是迷人，我是你，也難免讓她緾得不能分身，我這話對吧？——完了」。</p>
<p>羅菲的手跟着止住了。</p>
<p>「很快，很快，好極了」。</p>
<p>羅菲把紙樣遞過去後，暗想道：公司里的女職員就是作這樣事麼。心里止不住暗笑。</p>
<p>「打得很好，一個字沒有錯，你很好一。經理樂不迭地說。「我再問你一回，羅小姐，你到底結婚沒有」？</p>
<p>「到底沒有」！羅菲很果决的。「可是，老問我這話作什麼？有關係麼？」</p>

<h3 id="c217">關於失戀自殺 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 鐵生</p>
<p>本月六日在本埠新聞欄裏看到法學院學生王守成失戀自殺的消息，閱後悵然者久之，一種悵觸之感，深深的久繞腦際。近來因國民經濟的急劇崩潰，國民生活的陷於絕境、自殺的流行症好像鼠疫一樣的加速度傳染的當中，要以大學生王守成的失戀自殺，爲別開生面了。以一個受過大學教育的優秀靑年，國家社會倚賴正殷的時候，忽而以失戀自殺聞，那眞其情呵憫，其愚可笑！幾乎每人聽到都斥爲「不值得如此之犧牲的」！</p>
<p>我們知道在這畸形的資本主義社會裏，一切都變成爲商品的時候，「戀愛」這迷惑人的名詞也帶上了臭銅氣，變爲商品化了。巨商富豪固可取之不竭、任情享受；然而，赤貧如洗的窮光蛋要想愛情的賜與，那眞是懶蝦蟆想吃天鵝肉了。「戀愛」在這畸形社會已是變爲畸形的存在，變態的發展了。「所謂戀愛是神怪的」，「愛情是超越一切的」，那只有不懂世故的小孩子纔有這樣的幻想。在這畸形的社會裏、希望戀愛恢復其本來的眞面目—得到大家合理的圓滿解决。那除非將這不合理的經濟制度、澈底的改變以後。</p>
<p>我們又知道戀愛並不是人生的全部，不過是在人生旅途上可有可無的點綴罷了。有之固佳，無之則也一樣的生存。或者反而减輕生活的負擔，我們看見許許多多沒有飯吃的人餓死，但并沒有看見一個人沒有戀愛、而就馬上致命的。並且現時代所賦予我們靑年對於社會的使命，纔是絕對的重大、我們爲時代使命而犧牲戀愛是可以的；但我們爲戀愛而犧牲時代所賦予我們的使命是萬萬不可的。所謂：「死有重於泰山，有輕於鴻毛」。如王守成這次的失戀自殺，有給人們半絲的同情麼？如其他爲生活所壓迫，而不得不自殺的，那還有可憐憫的餘地，然而，這决不是正確的人生出路的。人生的出路楚與社會的出路一致的，只有面向現實，從刻苦中奮鬥，克服困難，纔楚人生的眞正出路。我想，王守成如有正確的認識，是絕對不會做這無意義的犧牲的。願一般正陷在情場中的靑年男女，防備不要再做這生命的浪費！</p>

<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>每天都在南國的火傘似的灼熱的陽光底下，車馬降隆的氣氛裏過生活，孱弱的身心，對是都市裏的繁華，熱鬧，委實已有點戚到疲倦了，因此，街頭的熱鬧，和遊藝塲的種種有力的誘惑，就連南國所特有　幽美怡適的凉夜，也都撩不起我的心情，去趕熱鬧，或帶着一隻滿大令，到淸幽靜謐的地方，坐在靑葱葱傘蓋似的大樹底下，和着銀鈴般的淙淙潺潺的流水，悠悠然的彈奏着，但我總喜歡茫然地關在妻凉的房子裏，獨對孤燈，靜息着困倦不堪的精神，有時，閉起眼睛、痴然遐思，做起快樂的夢想。</p>
<p>可是，今夜却有點不同了，畢畢剝剝的爆竹聲，音樂、龍燈、化裝隊……鬧哄哄地繞着全埠遊行，人，筋直有如螞蟻，胸膛緊靠背脊，背脊緊靠胸膛、充塞滿街滿巷，一排排地擁擠着，這不能不使我的平靜的心海動蕩起來，專一年一度似乎專爲過年而設的夜市，已經正式地開幕了。</p>
<p>夜市的會期，照例是在除夕前三天就開始的，一直到除夕夜爲止。可是，一般的商人，爲因商業上的繁榮，却習慣地要延長到元宵節過後，方才把夜市結束。夜市的塲所，原有一定的地方，而那些地方，却沒有固定的建築，因此，到了舉行夜市的時候，才臨時地把竹蓬架搭起來，裝着晶亮的電燈，分租給從遠近集合來的各種各門的商人，擺賣着各式各樣的東西，凑成這一年一，度熱鬧不過的夜市了。</p>
<p>凄凉靜擾的房子裏，似乎失掉了它的魔力，使我平着心氣的春戀着。晚飯後冲好了凉，我不再走進房子裏去了，擁夾在層層的人羣中，嗅着一股股使鼻孔難堪的濃濁的汗酸氣，和辣惡的栳枳的刺激性，給人潮湧進塲裏去了。</p>
<p>夜市裏簡直是一個遊藝塲，裏面除了人擠着人，和人看着人之外，就是那些五光十色的日用商品，和各種的玩藝見，如：皮猴猻戲，歌舞斑，大力士，飛機，木馬，轉輪等，這些，都是我在各埠的遊藝塲中逛得厭膩了，再不會彈動我的心弦，而使我注意了。最能引逗我的注意的，要算是那些陳列所。它的佈置，裝璜和說明，都能使我覺得滿意，與存留着深刻的印象。比如說：有一些工廠，它不但把它的出品陳列出來，就連笨重的機器也都搬來了，同時，實地的製造貨品，使參觀者知道某種貨品的製造的過程，并表示他們的製造的認眞，而對於某種貨物，有着深刻的印象</p>
<p>當我跨進衛生局的陳列所的時候，陡然地，使我深深的覺得，他們對於公眾衛生的提倡，眞是無微不至的呵！今年所陳列的是牙齒科，裏面除聯帶地陳列着各種各樣的獸類的牙齒之外，人類的牙齒，無論是疊牙，穿牙，重牙，以至於排列變異的種種時形的牙齒都有，眞是見所未見，搜羅盡置了。同時，牆壁上還掛着各種牙齒病的患者的種種臉部的變形的奇象力使人一瞧見就會驚心，全身不禁打起疙瘩來。轉入裏室，裏面陳列着各種蛀牙的模型，門牙，臼牙，犬牙，中蛀，邊蛀，……等，都有着蠻醒目的很大的模型。最後陳列着一架顯微鏡，把特製出來的蛀牙的虫菌，放在顯微鏡下的坡璃板上，讓參觀的人們從顯微鏡裏去認淸它的形狀。出口處再掛着許多提醒人們刷牙的掛圖，以及刷牙後的光潔美麗的牙齒的照片。這樣寓教育於娛樂之中，收效的廣大，是遠勝於課堂裏的，這不能不使我佩服他們的執政者的提倡的方法的良好哩！</p>
<h3 id="c219">苦悶與寂寞 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 史維之</p>
<p>以前，我祇能從書本上見到「苦悶」和「寂寞」的字眼，那時候，生活的擔子不曾挑起，喊，「苦悶」和「寂寞」，那原是和喊春花秋月同樣的，是一種裝飾自已的幌子，倒在愛人的懷裏，見到了花殘月缺，於是撒嬌地：「生的苦悶呀」，「生的寂寞呀」！</p>
<p>過後了不久、從學校裏踏進了社會的台階，於是知道了「苦悶」和「寂寞」究竟是怎樣的一會事，眼見得朋友們在這二個名詞前漸漸地衰老，潮漸地跌倒，心裏便不禁泛上了陰影，覺得自己也給「苦悶」和「寂寞」的微菌爬進了胸膛了。到後來，我自己也挑起了生活的擔子。並且，我？下碰了壁，我的靑年的豪情也就在强自振作生消失，我已沒有什麼野心，我祇想怎樣使我生活的擔子安定些，不讓他和旁的碰撞，這樣，好不致使我的擔子上再加上意外的負重，不致使我因爲增加了意外的負重而被壓毀。</p>
<p>對事業，我喪失了野心，對家，我有些怕，—家是不曾給我些微好處過！這樣，我自己知道，我的胸膛裏不僅有「苦悶」和「寂寞」，並且是給「苦悶」和「寂寞」所佔領了。</p>
<p>我越覺得自己孤獨起來，甚至，我意識到我一旦倒在路旁死了，我是祇有四塊松板睡的。—給我松板睡，那不是慈善家們的好心腸，反之，這是他們的「事業」，同時，也怕我這個格斃者會給他們帶了疫病來。</p>
<p>今年春天，在「苦悶」的慈熟越來越鹹水妹　胡考作利害的時候，我得到了一個到杭州去的機會，於楚，一半爲了一償宿願，一半也想醫療一下我的「苦悶」，好容易的凑集了幾塊錢，雜在少爺小姐們的隊伍裏，作起我的「春季旅行」來。</p>
<p>在杭州，我才明白地戚到，苦悶」和「寂寞」，原來是有若干的分別的。</p>
<p>那楚說，在到了杭州之後，苦悶是暫時忘却了，但楚跟蹤而來的，是一寂寞」。</p>
<p>但是，寂寞的人楚多着呢，當在風雨之夕的旅店裏，一個過了賣唱年齡的賈唱的姑娘拚命地用她的嗄嗓子呌喊的時侯，我悄悄地關地門來哭了。自然，在歌聲裏，我是聽到了她的憤怒的。</p>
<p>過了一星期，我帶了修長的影子，也帶了「苦悶」和「寂寞」，且依舊回到了上海。春季旅行並沒把我的「苦悶」和「寂寞」醫好。</p>
<p>爲了擺脫「苦悶」和「寂寞」，於楚我找尋起刺激來，找尋起儘我可能的刺激來。用酒，用跳舞，用一切無謂的，無聊的舉動來暫時麻醉我的神經。</p>
<p>可是，我不能，所有的刺激不够麻醉我，反之，我更給所有的刺激使我更苦痛了。「苦悶」的創傷並沒好，我發現了更多的「寂寞」的靈魂。</p>
<p>現在，刺激不想再找了，我祗想寂寞地來享受寂寞，讓我的靈魂去膠住寂寞的膠絲吧，這世界是寂寞的，在寂寞裏我應該學習一些什麼。</p>
<p>等寂寞的地獄給打破的時候，或該「苦悶」的鐐鎖也能被解除了。</p>
<p>可是，什麼時侯纔能打破寂寞的地獄呢？朋友！</p>
<p>沒有伴侶也好，就獨個兒踏上前途吧，那給月光照得長長的影子，不就是自己最好的伴侶嗎。</p>
<p>拖了瘦長的影子，用着枯啞的嗓子唱起你的寂莫之歌吧，人世是寂寞的，但是感到人世的寂寞的人多着呢。</p>

<p>他的心是矛盾的，他終日的思念都是爲的這一點，但費靈心思去想，結果還是沒有辦法的，有時簡直想得頭痛。</p>
<p>他今年是五十多歲了，他雖然有四個見子，但除了一個死了一個從十五歲失踪之外，現在只存下二個，在幾年前，生意還好的時候，他總是想念他那個已經失踪了的大見子的、他想：「要是他回來，這生意也可交給他了。」然而現在呢？他還是在想，但與從前的念頭不同了，他不是要他回來給他管生意，而是希望他兒子會突然發財的回來。</p>
<p>他時時對着存在家里的二個兒子說：你們大哥雖不務正業，但他很聰明，這樣十幾年在外面，要是還活着，他一定會發財的，算命先生從他小就說他上了三十歲一定會發財，現在他己三十多歲了，看看一定要回來了。」</p>
<p>老周從幾年前就對他二個兒子說遇這些話，但他總是等，却沒有見着他那要發財的見子回來。</p>
<p>鎭上的不景氣是愈久愈甚了，大街上終日都有店舖關門的事發生，這使老周再也沒法支持下去了。但他還想掙扎、他是不願意看到這家祖傳的老店在地手里關起那破　不堪的門板來的。他想盡了方法，但一切都沒有用處，沒有人來交易是最至要的事實。收入雖沒有，但支出却非要不可，他最後把現存的二個兒子也送到外地去自求生活，僅存的就只有他和老婆子二人了。油店却還照樣開着，但一個長長的三十日，主顧卻沒有幾個，那些油缸上，蜘蛛却在織起網來了。</p>

<p>— 難</p>
<p>將軍深知波蘭四境，强鄰窺伺，要保持國內外的和平，避免敵國的侵略，必須練成最有力量的軍隊，隨時抵抗外患，所以就悉心練軍，軍力一天一天的强盛起來，殆一九二〇年，俄紅軍果壓境，威刦甫獲自由的波蘭，經數度苦戰，俄紅軍勢如破竹，直逼華沙，距城僅八里，將軍斯時運用其智能神勇，率訓練未久的新軍，奮力邀撃，激戰二星期，把敵軍全部擊潰。保障波蘭和全歐洲的和平。功績最爲偉大，當時波蘭處境，確異常危殆，各國均以爲波蘭生命已斷絕希望，及勝利傳播，舉世震驚，蓋强弱之勢懸殊，非將士咸抱必死之心，萬無倖勝之理，波軍聲譽，騰高萬丈，是役也，將軍俘紅軍十一萬五千人，大砲三百九十尊，鐵甲車七輛，機關槍二千挺，軍火及工業材料一千貨車，火車二千六百列車，紅軍作戰的四軍，一一軍全數覆沒覆共餘二軍受極重大的損失。戰事終了，將軍乃積極注意於國內的建設，改進政治經濟社會文化現狀，融和各政黨的意見，使集中力量，復興國家。</p>
<p>將軍不是一個狄克推多，乃是一個大教育家，但是海外各國均目之爲狄克推多，實際上此名詞實未加以精密的選擇，狄克推多的名詞可以加之於墨索里希特勒，凱馬爾，但將軍之於波蘭應目爲「决定原素」The　Diciding　Faeton較爲實在也。將軍對外方策，亦正和內政一樣，在使波蘭獲有發展及和平，的機會，換言之，對外方策就是陸鄰政策，使波蘭與東西俄德兩强鄰日就友善，訂立不侵犯條約。</p>
<p>將軍一生犧牲個人於其國家，第一爲國家的獨立，第二爲國家前途的光大發揚，將軍臨終之前，得見波蘭日就强盛爲各國所尊重，及全國朝野繼續不斷的努力，穩渡世界經濟衰落貨幣戰爭的難關，日向光明前途邁步前進，眞是一件極可慶幸的事情。將軍現已完畢其工作，此項工作，爲數千年來波蘭人民所未能做到的，將軍死矣，他的教訓，事蹟和功業的紀念，乃其無窮奮鬥的精神，將永遠不减，將軍不僅爲一領袖，實爲一現代波蘭的解放者，教育者，和建築者，將軍卽波蘭將永駐波蘭人民心中，與波蘭國家長存無窮。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c223">合股商店的退股手續 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我在三年前和朋友合夥創辦了一家棉紗字號。資本金共計一萬二千元，我投資三千元。這店是由大股東王某經理一切事情。起初營業還不差，但一二年來因受經濟恐慌及時局的影響，漸漸的虧本起來了。自思財力弱薄的我，深怕含糊下去，將來虧折一巨，不但數年的心血，化爲烏有，那時或者還要負責淸理，那就力有不逮了。因此我便向經理王某接洽，要求退出，將剩餘的資本取回。可是王某不知根據那一點，竟加以拒絕，實在使我迷惑得很。不知我的要求有沒有不合理的地方，請你給我一個指示。爲盼。敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　張聞庚上</p>
<p>編奢按：失敗爲成功之母，大事業成功之前所遭的挫折是免不了的。所以我們覺得假使張君的財力雄厚而認爲該字號有發展的希望的話，那末要勸他不要灰心，繼續做去，只要能再接再厲的幹，前途當可樂觀。不過根據來信所說，張君的財力，似乎不很雄厚，那末爲求穩健起見，想脫離關係，减少危險，當然也是對的。</p>
<p>棉紗字號是合夥營業性質，各股東對於店中的盈虧，負完全無限責任。倘使含糊下去，責任非常重大。所以法律上規定在每年結賬後，股東有聲請退股之權。張君可據理力爭，向某甲交涉。如能妥洽，仍須據實登報聲明。否則張君與王某的非公開的手續，在法律上不能對抗「不知情的第三者」，糾紛仍不能免。萬一王某堅持不許，張君可一面登報聲明，自某時起與該號脫離關係；一面呈請法院備案。至於剩餘資本索還的交涉，則當另案進行。</p>

<p>被選舉爲三大歌星之一的周璇小姐，正式踏進了電影界了，我們以從前盼望袁美雲的心來盼望她，同時，周小姐那一副小鳥依人，和見了人彬彬有禮的態度，我們更覺得比校有出息的一個。</p>
<p>藝華公司費很大的財力，造就了袁美雲，現在繼之不息再以更大的决心想把這個富有天材的小姑娘——周璇，也促其成功爲中國電影界一顆亮晶晶的星，這一點，是顯出了藝華的精神和膽識。</p>
<p>事實上，這個被藝華發現的小姑娘，確也有被造就的把握。她已經担任了岳楓導演的「博士夫人」片中的博士小姐一角，是現代小姐的典型。岳楓視周璇，較之担「中國海的怒潮」時視袁美雲更甚，日夕在他嘴裏是：「周璇眞是有希望的一個人材。」</p>
<p>現在，我們萬分希望周小姐努力，將來的電影宮中的寶座，待周小姐來坐。</p>

<p>瞧！野心不已的侵略國家又挾着他們犀利新式的大砲，飛機，毒瓦斯……向我們弱小民族進攻了！</p>
<p>我們還是像以前那樣的給他們任意的宰割呢？給他們任意的侵略呢？不，我們現在不能再像以前那樣的軟弱忍耐了，我們該是振奮起精神反抗的時候了！我們該站在一條綫上向敵人拚命，担負起國家的興亡！怒吼吧！中華民族！</p>
<p>在藝華撮製，袁叢美導演的有聲片「暴風雨」中，有這樣一慕民族自救悲壯熱烈的演出！</p>

<p>易卜生的戲劇，各人生的描寫是非常生動的，就以拉娜這戲，他對五位主角個性的叙述，無不活潑如繪，他寫人性善惡的矛盾，他寫男女情愛的縱錯，就在不得答案中給了答案，這次業餘劇人第一次聯合公演，是以五個演技最高强的舞台人來演出，每個演員都能體貼易氏里所要寫出的人物來。</p>
<p>在整個舞台面的演出上，是具有美麗閑靜的趣味的，它是北歐十九世紀的故事，所以很有「閨怨」這影片的風格，再裏面是叙述着過聖誕節的情况，所以亦有安徒生「賣火柴的孩子」那般美麗的情趣，佈景中一塲大窗外的雪景，簡直是那篇童話的寫照了。</p>

<h3 id="c233">本埠建築及建築原料的過程（一） <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 顧影</p>
<p>今年四個月中木材進口較上年同期增四百萬自實行新稅後水泥進口較三年前僅餘五之一</p>
<p>住，行，同爲人生要素。故人口之澎漲。與建築事業之進展。有如形影之相隨。年來之建築事業。亦隨人員而推進。惜乎建築材料。如木材。水泥。鋼鐵等物。舶來品實屬不少。而國人皆樂用之。故洋木等輸入。年年增加。水泥自增加關稅。實行新稅以來。進口大减。茲將來年來本埠建築事業之興衰。及木材。水泥等進口之比較。分述於下。以供參玫：</p>
<p>一，本埠建築</p>
<p>本埠自前淸道光年間闢爲商埠以來。經中外人士之銳意經營。工商日臻繁盛。人心因之增加。截至現在止本市人口竟達三百五十餘萬。故建築事業之蓬勃。當爲吾人所意料。以就近之八年來全市營造總額言之。當民十六年間全市每年營造總額數爲一千五百二十六萬三千五百五十二兩（銀本位）後逐漸增加。至十九年間。竟達七千一百五十一萬一千八百一六兩（銀本位）之巨在此四年間。激增三倍六十分之七餘。考其原因。由於人口之激增及地產商投資之所致。在此期間。堪稱爲黃金時代。造後因天災人禍。及不景氣之激盪。加以一二八事變發生。天堂視爲畏途。殷實住戶。或有遷處內地者。地產商亦不敢投資。故民二十一年間之全市建築統計。較十九年猛减一位有餘。祗三千五百五十四萬一千兩（銀本位）至去年（二十三年份）止雖不减少。但總不能追十九年份之巨數。例八年營造總數比較表於下：</p>
<p>年份　每年營造數總額</p>
<p>十六　一五·二六三·五五二兩</p>
<p>十七　三二·三五六·九八六兩</p>
<p>十八　四五·三八六·六八二兩</p>
<p>十九　七一·五一一·八一六兩</p>
<p>年份　每年營造數總額</p>
<p>二十　六二·三五一·二五〇兩</p>
<p>甘一　三五·五四一·〇〇九兩</p>
<p>廿二　五八·二六八·一五〇元</p>
<p>廿三　六四·一一二·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>在近年來農村經濟破產。各業凋疲。全世界不景氣彌漫之中，建築額之减落。亦應有之現象。但尤能站立每年有六千四百餘萬元之建築總額而較上年增五百八十四萬三千八百五十元。呈欣榮之象。其原因有兩點。一，內地因災荒連連生活困難。故內地人民都向都市裏求出路。在都市人口增加。當謀容納居住。如大上海區域內開闢荒蕪地域。建造平民住宅。以及市中心區之大規模建築等。二，租界內高層建築之發展。無論已造成及未造成之房屋。皆實行其佔天不佔地之主張。積極增高。有此兩點。宜其建築事業之不衰也。以上年全市之六千四百十一萬二千元之總額。計公共租界佔二千七百六十萬一千元爲首。大上海區次之爲二千三百七十三萬五千元。法租界又次之爲一千二百七十七萬六千元。可知大上海區域之努力建築。殊不弱於租界也。本市之建築事業。旣如上述。當經營是業之營造廠。自極發達。現在本市共有二千餘家。內中具有營造廠規模者千餘家。外均係營造一部份工作奢。如粉飾。油漆·或裝修。水木作等工塲而稱爲營造廠者千餘家。至於範圍較大者。僅二百餘家也。</p>
<h3 id="c234">美國最新戲院之設計（上） <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— B．A．Hueton原著小昂譯</p>
<p>美國是一個最富庶的國家，牠的人民大多數都是有錢的，所以娛樂的場所，是特別的多，據統計的結果，美國的紐約城，大戲院，竟有一百餘家，小的尙不在內。上海的戲院，雖然是很發達，恐怕也望塵莫及吧。最近因爲營業競爭的關係，各戲院的主人翁，漸漸地注意到戲院建築的形式和設計了，有一家資本最雄厚的戲院，因爲最近數月營業淸淡，想改造戲院，就公開求設計圖，靑年建築家Hueton氏，也就因此成名了，他的設計，確是精密周到，不愧爲天才建築家，我現在把他的設計，很簡單的介紹一下，對於上海的建築界，確實有不少的帮助，仝時對於靑年建築家，恐怕也有相當的鼓勵呢。</p>
<p>（一）位置之選擇</p>
<p>戲院要在交通便利，人口最多的區域，最要緊的，要在城市馬路的幹線上，如上海的大馬路和法大馬路的附近，是很相宜的了，同時戲院要在停車塲的附近和下車門口在一邊，因爲太遠了，或者要穿過馬路，這些都使戲迷掃興，戲院前要有很寬的馬路，因爲小姐太太們的自備汽車，是在離演戲不久的時候，接二連三的開來，尤其是休息日和演好片的時候，如果沒有很闊的馬路，恐怕有失事的危險，上海的大戲院，對於這一點，是不注意的，應當改良一下才好。</p>
<h3 id="c235">建築行話（十七） <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>—關於築塲裏用—</p>
<p>泥刀—泥水匠不能離身的「隨身法寶。」就是泥刀和鐵板二件東西。差不多在砌牆時。就要利用這柄泥刀了。可是這柄泥刀在於泥水匠的本身有時候除了砌牆的工作之外。往往用以代表英尺的度量。作爲皮數的標準。大概以泥刀的長度（就是刀背和柄的一段。）計算。普通以二分灰縫（詳前）算一皮。則泥刀的長度適合五皮。因爲砌牆如遇到淸水的地方。灰縫第一須留意。務使有歪斜的弊病。泥水匠於是就想出這樣的方法了。</p>
<p>鐵板—對於粉刷時。不論刮吵。粉石灰或細沙之類。泥水匠必需應用鐵板。另外還有一種呌鋼皮鐵板。比普通施用的大一倍。差不多遇到粉石膏時。非它莫辦。因爲鋼皮鐵板的質地光絜。粉石膏必求細膩而光滑。所以普通用的鐵板就不能應用了。</p>
<p>淸水—牆面並不粉刷任何質料的本來面目。就呌淸水。如過粉有水泥，石灰，細沙，石膏，或磨光石等等統呌混水。</p>
<p>噴桶—砌牆用的磚料。第一必需以水浸透。如遇辦不到的地方。也必需以水澆足。因爲磚料的本身。終楚乾燥的。泥水匠如果不澆水或浸水。就將磚塊不問情由。一塊一塊刮上沙泥砌在牆身上。假使在日光的地方。經不得臼晒夜露。牆身應該用三十年的。就會變成十多年了。所以對於磚料的必需充分用水的灌溉。監工者切不可疏忽從事。同時旣在脚手上的磚塊。那未就利用噴桶到脚手上澆。所以築塲裏也缺不得這種東西。</p>
<p>仙鶴—築塲裏在近幾年來對於建築的情形。並不像從前那般造些二三層高度的街房之類。以爲算是大工程了。近幾年來。單單上海一埠高入雲霄的大建築物。完工的也有許多地方。但這種大建築物的搆造。大都以人字鐵爲建築上的大宗材料。可是每根工字鐵的重量。决非人力能够搬運的。那末就得利用仙鶴車來帮助人力之不足了。至於仙鶴的形狀是怎樣的。它有三隻脚和一個長頭頸。差不多和仙鶴的形狀畢肖。所以稱之仙鶴車。其實以譯音翻出來就是起重機。它的代價是非常高昻。普通小資本的築塲是不容易買到的。</p>
<p>產牌—在山牆（詳前）的脊（就是俗稱風火牆）。隆起的一段而拖到檐口再倒踏步的一級一級收到牆身的地方。就呌產牌。</p>
<p>承攬—承攬就是設施工程的章程</p>
<p>華絲—羅絲如遇旋轉的地方太長。就用華絲襯托。它是一塊方或圓形的鐵片。築塲裏也呌它做荳腐干。</p>
<p>搖班—一個築塲的組織。是包羅大眾的力量。决不是個人的權威所能够成功的。所以築塲裏不論是賬房裏的監工者或做手們帶來的小學生意。」假使在工作上不出越軌的動作之外。各方面都應該團結一致。上下親善。决不可狐假虎威。像煞有介事。而尤其是賑房間裏的監工者之流。差不多個個有充足的學問和有相當的智識。對於做手們應該循循善誘。因爲做手們是不懂道理的。如碰到雙方决裂的時候。很容易覺得棘手無策。有時候動了公憤。說不定全體罷工。可是築塲裏並不呌罷工。而呌做搖班。搖班在築塲裏是最忌的事情。（待績）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Negotiations Begin on the Incident, Resolution Steps Under Consultation, Preliminary Discussions Concluded Yesterday Morning, Progress Reported Smoothly Awaiting Central Government Response, President Wang Cables Qin Dechun to Urge Him to Stay <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to an official Japanese source this morning, negotiations on the incident began at 10:30 last night. The meeting took place at Qin Dechun's residence. The Chinese side was represented by Qin Dechun and several representatives from the Chahar Province. The Japanese side was represented by Doihara, Matsui, and Takahashi. (Beiping Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Zhangbei Incident, responsible personnel from both China and Japan held talks at Qin Dechun's private residence at 10:00 p.m. on the 23rd. The Chinese side was represented by Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Zhang Yunrong, Cheng Ke, and Chen Juesheng. The Japanese side was represented by Doihara, Matsui, and Takahashi, among others. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 a.m. on the 24th. The outcome was quite satisfactory. Steps for resolution have been submitted to the central government for instructions, and further negotiations will continue after instructions are received. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Representatives from both sides met formally at Qin Dechun's private residence last night regarding the Zhangbei issue. The Chinese side was represented by Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Cheng Ke, Chen Juesheng, and Zhang Yunrong, five in total. The Japanese side was represented by Doihara, Matsui, and Takahashi. The agreement reached was generally smooth. Qin and Xiao have telegraphed the central government to request instructions on the agreed-upon steps. As of noon today, the central government has not yet replied to Beiping. Therefore, the two sides are not prepared to continue talks today. The method of resolution will be discussed once the central government's reply arrives in Beiping. According to well-informed sources, the issue should be easy to resolve. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying issued a written statement to visiting reporters this morning, saying, "Negotiations on the Chahar incident began last night with a formal meeting between responsible personnel from the Japanese side and our side, which can be said to have entered the stage of formal negotiation. The content and steps are all being consulted with the central government. I personally am determined to assist with sincerity from the sidelines in order to bring the incident to a swift conclusion and stabilize the region. Chairman Qin's resignation is purely to express his solidarity with Mr. Song in advancing or retreating together. The difficult circumstances are also a factor. The central government has not yet replied to this. The military and political order in Chahar Province remains as calm as usual." (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara, Matsui, and Takahashi telegraphed the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Nanjirō, last night regarding the results of their talks with Qin, Xiao, and others. Matsui revisited Takahashi to discuss matters. Takahashi told reporters that the Chahar negotiations began with preliminary discussions with Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others last night. He regretted being unable to disclose the details of the content. However, in general, both sides hope for a peaceful resolution to the incident as soon as possible, so progress is expected to be smooth and no other problems are expected to arise. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 8:00 a.m. this morning, the Beiping Army Attaché Office announced that Major General Doihara, along with Attaché Takahashi and Lieutenant Colonel Matsui, met with the Chahar authorities at Qin Dechun's residence in Beiping on the 23rd to begin negotiations on the Chahar issue. (Dentsu Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side still hopes that the Chahar incident can be resolved through local negotiations. Although the Japanese side hopes for improvements on various points, we have automatically implemented them. However, Doihara and Matsui are still working hard in Beiping to meet with the responsible person of the Chahar side. Doihara, Matsui, and Takahashi visited Qin Dechun's residence on the 23rd night for informal discussions. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun telegraphed his resignation, and the central government has not yet replied to Beiping. According to those around Qin, Qin wants to advance or retreat together with Song Zheyuan, and it is feared that persuasion will not dissuade him from his intention to resign. Regarding the Chahar negotiations, Qin has already begun negotiations with the Japanese side, following the instructions of the central government, in order to bring the incident to a swift conclusion. After the negotiations are completed, Qin will go to Tianjin to meet with Song and report on the progress. Song and Qin will not leave Tianjin in the immediate future. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun visited Bao Wenxue, director of the Military Affairs Commission office, this morning to report on the progress of the negotiations with the Japanese side regarding the Zhangbei incident last night. The conversation lasted about an hour before Qin excused himself. Qin then went to the Political Readjustment Committee to meet with Wang Kemin and report on everything. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Dechun telegraphed on the 23rd to earnestly resign from his position as acting Chairman of Chahar Province. After receiving the telegram, the President of the Executive Yuan will reply with a cable of encouragement, instructing him to preside over the Chahar administration. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Zhangbei incident is being negotiated in Beiping. It is understood that the Chahar Provincial Government has agreed to resolve it locally, but must obtain principles from the central government and begin negotiations with the Japanese side. Furthermore, Song Zheyuan has requested a 20-day leave from his position as commander of the 29th Army to seek medical treatment for his back ailment in Tianjin. Xiao Zhenying arrived in Tianjin on the 23rd to meet with Song and report on the situation, and then returned to Beiping in the afternoon. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsui will return to Zhangjiakou this afternoon due to his long absence from Zhangjiakou. If the incident can be resolved recently, he will temporarily stay in Zhangjiakou; otherwise, he will come to Beiping again. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun visited Bao Wenxue and Wang Kemin separately on the morning of the 24th to report on the recent situation in Chahar Province and the progress of the Chahar incident negotiations. He visited Xiao Zhenying at noon for a discussion. The Military Affairs Commission convened a temporary standing committee meeting at 4:00 p.m. for discussions. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Military Attaché Takahashi met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at noon on the 24th. He said that negotiations on the Zhangbei incident have begun. Qin Dechun, Matsui, and others met on the evening of the 23rd. He was not at liberty to disclose the content, but he hoped for a peaceful resolution. He will visit Wang Kemin this afternoon for routine courtesies. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Dechun, acting chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, telegraphed the central government to resign. The President of the Executive Yuan cabled a message of consolation and urged him to remain in office on the 24th. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is burying himself in work on the military campaign against bandits in Sichuan. The remnant bandits of Zhu and Mao, due to limited elite troops, are eager to join forces with the bandits of Xu. Chairman Chiang is also very concerned about the Hebei-Chahar negotiations, hoping for an early resolution, and has telegraphed He Yingqin to return north quickly to preside over everything. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After Qin Dechun resigned, he sent another telegram to Guo Zhihan, the head of the Chahar Department of Finance, and the provincial commissioners, instructing them to jointly take responsibility and maintain provincial administration. He also telegraphed Zhang Weishen, Chief of Staff of the 29th Army, to strictly restrain the troops and prevent accidents. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A person in charge of the Chahar Office in Tianjin said that no one knew about Qin Dechun's resignation beforehand, not even Chairman Song. It was purely his own intention. Qin has been under great pressure from public and private affairs recently due to the Zhangbei incident and changes in the political situation, resulting in a sudden onset of eye disease. After the telegram of resignation was sent, the central government's reply had not yet arrived. Xiao Zhenying's return to Beiping was to persuade Qin on behalf of Chairman Song to make an effort and not harm the public good for private reasons. The Chahar negotiations have stalled due to the lack of a responsible person. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The central government has telegraphed Wang Kemin, instructing him to convey to Qin Dechun to bravely shoulder the arduous task, negotiate with the Japanese side according to the nature of local diplomacy, and resolve the Zhangbei incident. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Imai, head of the Kwantung Army's Yuguan Special Service Agency, flew from Yuguan to Changchun on a military plane on the morning of the 23rd to meet General Nanjirō, report on the recent situation in Hebei, and make requests. Before leaving, he told Japanese newspaper reporters that he would fly to Beiping on the 25th, stay for about three or four days, and then return to Yuguan. He also wanted to meet with Wang Kemin and Yin Rugeng for a discussion. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsui, a Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, returned to Zhangjiakou at noon on the 24th. Doihara will be responsible for negotiations in Beiping on the Chahar incident. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable sources, after the Chinese and Japanese representatives met last night to discuss the Chahar incident, they did not set a date for a future meeting. Therefore, many believe that the Chahar incident negotiations have reached a final resolution satisfactory to both sides. Doihara, the chief representative of the Japanese side, will return to Tianjin tomorrow, and Qin Dechun will probably return to Zhangjiakou in a few days. Qin returned home from the German Hospital at 8:00 p.m. last night, began the meeting at 10:30 p.m., and returned to the hospital at 2:00 a.m. this morning. According to eyewitnesses, the Japanese representatives left Qin's residence late at night looking very pleased. Qin recently resigned from his position as Chairman of Chahar, but many believe that this move is merely equivalent to a request for a vote of confidence. Qin is now preparing to take office. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Military Attaché Takahashi denied that the Chahar incident has been resolved, but admitted that no date has been set for a future meeting. Many believe that the terms of resolution have already been drafted and are now awaiting formal approval from Nanjing. The fact that Japanese representative Matsui is returning to Zhangjiakou today is a sign that, even if the negotiations have not ended, the critical stage has passed. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A group of seven members of the Japanese Ta衆 Party, including politicians Abe Shigeo, Hirano Manabu, and Watanabe Toshi-no-suke, arrived in Tianjin on the 24th to investigate recent events in Hebei and Chahar. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Imai, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, flew to Changchun on the morning of the 23rd to meet with Nanjirō and report on the situation. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said that the case of unifying the police authority in the urban area and the seven special districts has not yet been researched and decided. In the future, it is planned to establish a police affairs section in each special district, subject to the supervision and command of the special district director. The special district directors will not concurrently hold the title of chief of the public security sub-bureau. The police affairs section will be an organ subordinate to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, so that there will be no conflicts in the city's police authority. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said that the Tianjin-Tanggu Garrison Headquarters will hold a meeting soon to discuss ways to maintain security. According to the organizational regulations of the headquarters, all military, police, and military police in Tianjin-Tanggu are under its command. The Wuhe Water Police Bureau, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Maritime Public Security Bureau, and the Military Police Command have direct command authority. The headquarters' expenses have been budgeted at over 7,000 yuan per month, to be received from the Military Affairs Commission. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Although Song Zheyuan has entrusted Zhang Zhizhong to temporarily take charge of the affairs of the 29th Army after leaving Chahar, because the military authority has not yet been handed over, he has specifically requested a 20-day leave from the Military Affairs Commission. After his back ailment is treated in Tianjin, he will return to the army to handle affairs. Song is determined to obey the central government regarding his position as commander of the army. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song relinquished his post and went to Tianjin for recuperation with a relaxed attitude, rarely receiving visiting guests. When asked about current affairs, Song declined to express his opinions. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Zhenying met with Song in Tianjin, conveyed the central government's intentions, and rushed back to Beiping by car on the evening of the 23rd to meet with Qin Dechun. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Wang Kemin went to the Political Readjustment Committee at 9:00 a.m. this morning to assume office. He first summoned Secretary-General Yu Jiaji to discuss the latest situation in North China and the internal situation of the Political Readjustment Committee. He then summoned all the staff in the Dongren Building at 10:00 a.m. to give instructions, saying that although Huang Min's illness has improved, he still needs to recuperate, so he will not come north for the time being. The central government has sent him north to temporarily take over. Following the old ways, everything will proceed as usual. He hoped that everyone would work hard to serve the country and fulfill their duties. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara went to the Political Readjustment Committee to visit Wang Kemin at 11:00 a.m. this morning. Wang immediately received him, and they talked for about half an hour before Doihara excused himself. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara visited Wang Kemin at the Political Readjustment Committee this morning to discuss the overall issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation in North China. The Chahar negotiations will also be handled by Doihara staying in Beiping. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

He will visit Wang tomorrow morning to report on the province's move to Baoding and the recent administrative situation. He will not stay in Beiping for long and will return to Baoding within a week.

<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army Headquarters issued a communiqué today stating that in the past six months, the army has engaged in 195 skirmishes with the volunteer armies within the "Manchukuo" territory. The army suffered 25 dead and 75 wounded. The volunteer armies abandoned 142 bodies. It is estimated that there are a total of 28,000 volunteer soldiers within "Manchukuo," about one-seventh of the total number in 1931. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to the Kwantung Army's announcement, all units are sparing no effort in suppressing the volunteer armies. It is now estimated that there are a total of 18,000 volunteer soldiers in Manchuria, and their organizations have the following characteristics: (1) Gradually becoming more organized; (2) Gradually imitating the uniforms and flags of the "Manchukuo" army; (3) Tactics are gradually becoming more sophisticated.</p>
<p>In addition, due to terrain considerations, suppression is extremely difficult, so it is feared that the volunteer armies will not be quickly reduced. The suppression situation of the various units under the jurisdiction of the Kwantung Army is recorded below:</p>
<p>Number of engagements: 195, Number of volunteer soldiers encountered: 14,537, Number of enemy volunteer soldiers killed in action: 142, Number of soldiers killed in action: 25, Number of soldiers wounded in action: 75</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the recent increase in volunteer armies in various parts of Manchukuo is the impoverishment of the rural areas, and the fact that the establishment of police agencies has turned half-farmers, half-bandits into purely "bandits." As a result, there has been an increase in transient waves. Most of the remaining "bandits" are "ideological bandits" (communist ideology) centered on Koreans, who continue to operate based on the eastern border area of northern Manchuria, so there may have been a considerable increase in July and August.

<p>(Paris) Former French Finance Minister Armand Mandel, who traveled to China in 1920, recently recounted his experiences to a reporter from Le Matin, saying that at the time he had asked Japanese General Tanaka why the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin did not seize China by force. General Tanaka replied, "To seize China by force is as easy as turning one's hand, but if we were to take this step, we would inevitably be in conflict with European countries within a few weeks, and the difficulties would then begin. We Japanese are a patient and order-loving people. In the future, when the economies and finances of European and American countries run into difficulties and they have to concentrate on internal affairs, they will only be able to take a bystander's attitude toward the events that occur in China. At that time, we Japanese will take swift action, because we will be undertaking the task of a police officer. We will wait quietly for events to occur and then act." (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Dawn of Industrial and Commercial Revival <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its 6th General Assembly of Member Representatives the day before yesterday, passing 20 important resolutions, among which the most important was the establishment of an Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee to investigate the causes of decline and study revival plans. Although the details of the proposal are not known, by reading the text, one can know that it is a crucial measure for the present.</p>
<p>Shanghai's industry and commerce have a glorious history and an important mission. Their every word and action often set an example for the world. Now that they are emerging to seek revival, there must be some visible results. However, since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai has been impacted externally by the tides of the world economy and internally by the bankruptcy of the rural economy, resulting in the current situation. Fortunately, with the cooperation of all parties, the precarious situation has been maintained. However, foreign economic aggression has not only not diminished its sharp edge, but has intensified. We want to raise tariffs in order to protect industry and commerce in case of emergency, but before the matter has been implemented, criticism has already arrived. In order to prevent the export of silver, there is stealing and leaking everywhere, which is difficult to investigate and impossible to suppress. A slight oversight in handling will lead to diplomatic incidents. All legitimate defense measures, under today's circumstances, are difficult to implement. What else can be said? Take the Sino-French Vietnamese Commercial Treaty as an example. It took many years to complete. The content of the treaty is naturally mutually beneficial, but according to the report of French Colonial Minister Roland, it said, "It is quite beneficial to France. Tokyo's Japanese coal and Vietnamese rice will be easier to sell to China in the future." If the sales of Annam coal and rice are entirely profitable, China's coal and rice will inevitably be hit, which is inevitable. Looking at the import of cotton cloth in the past five months, eastern goods accounted for the majority, English goods only accounted for half of eastern goods, and other goods are not worth mentioning. In the yarn market, Chinese merchants are still suffering losses, while foreign merchants can sell out in a few days. What is the reason for this? Also, what about coal and rice? If all countries demand the same most-favored-nation treatment, how will we respond? If we allow them to use it, then Siamese and Burmese rice, and Japanese and Fushun coal will all flow in. All of this is just a brief example. Other similar situations are countless. Therefore, people often think of imitating foreign conventions as a plan for the revival of their own country. Their intentions are good, but as for the unified import trade, regardless of how it is unified, what if people take advantage of their battleships, armed forces, concessions, and wharves to not be subject to our control? Managing exchange rates is certainly good. Regardless of the strength, what if there are places where it cannot be fully implemented due to the history of finance? The only way is to prescribe medicine after knowing the disease. If the medicine is good but the condition is unknown, or if the medicine is used in excess, it can be fatal. Now the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce seeks to revive industry and commerce by starting with investigation, which is also seeking to know the disease before prescribing medicine. Once the condition is clear, treatment is easy. If we only know how to give ready-made medicine without considering the reality of the condition, the danger can be seen immediately.</p>
<p>Well said by Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, "With a market that claims to be the best in the country, and yet it is daily in the midst of storms, calling for help. This is also the shame of the General Assembly." Now, the members of the Chamber of Commerce can encourage themselves with a sense of shame, using investigation as a tool and revival as a goal. This is also what Confucius called "Loving learning is close to wisdom. Striving for action is close to benevolence. Knowing shame is close to courage." However, Confucius also said, "Knowing these three things is knowing how to cultivate oneself. Knowing how to cultivate oneself is knowing how to manage people. Knowing how to manage people is knowing how to govern the world and the country." We deeply hope that everyone can have a sense of shame, love learning and strive for action in order to seek the revival of our entire nation, not just a few industries.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Central · National Government Bi-Weekly Report <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Central bi-weekly meeting on the morning of the 24th, about 600 people attended, including Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Xiao Zhongzhen, Chen Gongbo, and staff. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting. Chen Gongbo reported on "The Significance of Establishing the Nation on Agriculture," stating that the current rural bankruptcy in our country necessitates urgent agricultural relief. However, establishing the nation on agriculture should not be the national policy of China, nor should it be considered the only way out for China. Moreover, establishing the nation on agriculture has three negative impacts: (1) It cannot compensate for import surpluses because it is extremely difficult for Chinese agricultural products to find foreign markets. (2) It cannot stabilize the economy because there are too many farmers, land allocation will inevitably be small, and it will certainly not be possible to use machine production. Furthermore, there is a serious problem: countries that establish themselves on agriculture are often easily relegated to colonial status. (3) It cannot stabilize politics because there are too many farmers, very few of whom are wealthy, making it difficult to bear national taxes, and they are easily affected by natural disasters and man-made calamities, leading to rural bankruptcy. Both of these can destabilize politics. Recently, many have considered "establishing the nation on agriculture" as a fundamental and righteous policy for China and are proud of it. In reality, rescuing rural areas is indeed an urgent task, but determining "establishing the nation on agriculture" as a national policy is inappropriate. We should find ways to reduce the farmer population and develop light industry. Therefore, it should be amended to "Establishing the Nation on Agriculture" as the great path to saving China.

<p>(Nanjing) At the National Government bi-weekly meeting on the morning of the 24th, about 500 people attended, including Ye Chucang, Chen Shaokuan, Ma Chaojun, Chu Minyi, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and staff from various departments of the National Government. Government Committee member Ye Chucang presided over the meeting, leading the ceremony, and then gave an impromptu report, stating that national crises are unavoidable for any country in the world. Especially when a country strives for survival, it will inevitably encounter many difficulties. It is essential for us to remain calm in order to overcome these difficulties. For example, when we walk on dangerous roads and climb to high places, those with weak hearts become panicked and fearful, which inevitably affects their walking and prevents them from reaching their destination. However, those with healthy hearts will surely succeed. This is the relationship between substance and function that the ancients spoke of. The substance of a country is the government. Only with a sound and stable government can all the country's facilities be sound. We should deeply understand the meaning of relying on many to build the country, unite in virtue, consolidate the substance of the country, and then diligently engage in national construction, so that we can overcome difficulties.

<p>(Hankou) At 7:00 AM on the 24th, the General Headquarters held a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Weekly meeting in the temporary auditorium. Over a thousand people attended, including Zhang Xueliang, Qian Dajun, heads and deputy heads of various departments, and all staff. Zhang Xueliang presided over the meeting, and the ceremony was conducted as usual. Then, the director of the Political Training Department, He Zhonghan, reported on the meaning of labor service and the work plan of the General Headquarters' labor service group. He stated that the meaning of labor service, as explained by the Chairman, can be summarized by the two sayings: "Life is based on labor as one's duty, and service is the purpose." He then said that the General Headquarters' labor service group has been organized and is ready. The work plan intends to start with education, soldier education, and public education, and from the health aspect, establishing public treatment centers. Starting from small to large, from near to far, he hopes that all comrades will have the greatest determination to serve society through labor. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun stayed in a hotel after arriving in Nanjing. At 2:00 PM, he went to the official residence of the Minister of Railways to visit President Wang, where they discussed matters and he reported on the political situation in Hubei Province. He left after about 40 minutes. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing by boat at around 10:00 AM on the 24th. Xu Xiuzhi and Zhang's old friends came to the pier to welcome him. After Zhang disembarked, he entered the city to rest at his private residence. He planned to visit President Wang in the afternoon to report. According to Zhang's words to the Central News Agency reporter on the boat, he came to Nanjing this time at the invitation of President Wang for inquiries. The rumors that he would go to Japan or Bao are not true. He has no such plans, and the central authorities have not discussed this with him. He does not know where these speculations came from. He plans to stay in Nanjing for about a week and then go to Shanghai before returning to Hubei. The recent political situation in Hubei Province is very good. The financial year of the 22nd has ended, and revenue and expenditure have reached a balanced position. However, due to slight flooding, some planned projects have not yet been carried out. Except for some disturbances by He's bandits in the Xiang-E border area, the entire province can be declared pacified. Education has decided to implement compulsory education from the 24th year to promote literacy. In terms of construction, Hubei Province has 3,000 kilometers of highways open to traffic, and another 3,000 kilometers are under construction. He will report in detail to the central authorities on the provincial affairs this time. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing on the Tinghua at 10:30 AM on the 24th. Tang Youren, Chen Rui, representative of the Executive Yuan, and several others welcomed him at the pier. Chu Minyi and Ge Jingyou arrived slightly later. Ma, the secretary, and one adjutant came with Zhang. At 10:45 AM, Tang Youren, Chu Minyi, and Chen Rui continued to Zhang's residence for a meeting and had lunch together. At 2:30 PM, they went to the official residence of the Minister of Railways to visit President Wang. In addition to reporting on the administrative situation in Hubei Province, Zhang also briefly discussed other matters. Zhang said that the Tokyo telegram stating that he would travel to Japan with his family on July 4th was completely inaccurate. Local officials cannot leave their posts at will. He has no motivation to go to Japan, and the government has no such plans. The origin of this rumor may be due to the fact that his relatives are traveling to Japan next month, and his Shanghai residence booked the cabin space for them, which may have led to this misunderstanding. He also said that he came to visit President Wang to report on the local situation. As for the central political situation and the Hebei incident, he is far away in Jianghan and has not been to Nanjing for a long time, so he does not know the details. He will hear about everything when he visits President Wang in the afternoon. As a local official in terms of his duties, he will strictly abide by any instructions from the central government. He will stay in Nanjing for two days and then go to Shanghai, with a planned itinerary of one week before returning to Hubei. After two years of thorough rectification of Hubei's finances, all kinds of exorbitant taxes have been abolished. In the 23rd year, due to disasters in various counties, he felt quite exhausted. After reorganizing various tax revenues under the principle of not increasing tax amounts or tax rates, he has achieved a balance of revenue and expenditure and has been able to repay part of the old debts. This year, agricultural affairs in Hubei Province have improved significantly, and the additional education tax, which has also not been collected to make up for the shortfall, has been decided to be abolished. It is expected that in the 24th year, Hubei's education plan will be carried out in three separate stages: (1) Promoting compulsory education: Starting from July 1st, compulsory primary schools will be added throughout the province. Based on the Baojia organization, one compulsory primary school will be established in each Lianbao. There are more than 6,000 Lianbao in the province, so more than 6,000 primary schools will be added. (2) Literacy Campaign: According to Mr. Tao Xingzhi's plan, primary school students will be used to conduct literacy campaigns, with households as units led by parents and factories as units led by factory directors to eliminate illiteracy. (3) Implementing civic training: Starting from July 1st, civic training will be implemented in the provincial capital. The above three items are scheduled to be completed or reach a certain stage within the 24th year. Currently, Hubei Province has completed more than 3,000 kilometers of highways, and another 2,000 kilometers are under construction separately. 3,000 kilometers of telephone lines have been completed. Last year, Hubei Province implemented a unified transportation industry, which was very effective. The original term was scheduled to expire this year. The transportation industry has petitioned the government to continue the unified control, which will continue this year. The remaining bandits in Hubei have been largely pacified, the locality is peaceful, and all administrative construction is proceeding step by step. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jiliang hosted a press conference on the afternoon of the 24th, reporting that he came here on the order of the central government to resolve the Haiqi and Haishen matter, which is purely an internal naval issue and has no political implications. When the Haiqi and Haishen were previously in Hengtang, they were suspected of disobeying orders due to unclear navigation routes, so they were shelled. After arriving in Hong Kong, the captains of the two ships did not come to pay their respects, only sending Wu Wenfu to negotiate, which was obviously rude. However, he hopes that it can still be resolved peacefully and is currently discussing solutions with the Hong Kong government. In the afternoon, the Haiqi and Haishen continued to send personnel to Ninghai to discuss solutions. By 6:00 PM, they had largely reached an agreement, with only the issue of handing over the firing pins remaining to be discussed. The Haiqi and Haishen agreed to disperse the crew members among the central government's ships. Chen Jiliang will send soldiers to replace the crew members of the Haiqi and Haishen, and they can return north in two or three days. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Naval Vice Minister Chen Jiliang today issued a formal statement to Reuters regarding the gathering of Nanjing warships in Hong Kong, saying that he came only to escort the Haishen and Haiqi to the north. This is purely a naval event and has no political role. He does not want to make things difficult for Guangdong. Once the necessary arrangements are completed, the warships in Hong Kong will return to Nanjing. Chen mentioned that Ninghai fired warning shots outside Hong Kong to warn the rebellious ships to return to Hong Kong, saying that these two ships were asking for trouble. They disobeyed orders, left Hong Kong without permission, and their actions were suspicious. When Ninghai encountered these two ships on Friday evening, they claimed to be heading to Xiamen, but their route was not directly toward Xiamen. Currently, there are six central government warships in Hong Kong, and they are still awaiting instructions from Nanjing. It is now believed that the Haiqi and Haishen can be allowed to head north from Hong Kong with their original crew members, but in the future, the personnel of these two ships may need to be distributed among various ships.

<p>(Hankou) Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill has suffered heavy losses in recent years. It was temporarily shut down a month ago. After the shareholders ran around and the provincial government sought relief, a shareholders' meeting was held on the 24th. Chairman of the Board Lu Chaobo and Director Zhou Xingtang proposed two items: (1) Allocate 20% of the profits to the first group of creditors (i.e., Anli Ying Foreign Company), but they must waive the warehouse mortgage of 210,000 yuan. (2) Allocate 50% of the profits to the second group of creditors (i.e., Xingye Bank, etc.).

According to the Italian government spokesperson, Eden could not explain the justification for Britain's actions regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement. As for the Sky Treaty issue, it is more related to Britain and less related to Italy. All the issues raised by Britain were requests to Italy, while Italy is in a defensive position. Italy's firm attitude is generally regarded as evidence of the close friendship between France and Italy. The government spokesperson also said that the Abyssinian issue is not within the scope of the British-Italian talks. The rumors that Eden proposed a plan advocating intervention by a third country to seek a friendly solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute are also untrue. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Eden will discuss the naval issue this morning, or also the Western Sky Treaty and the Danube Conference. It is expected that the Italian Prime Minister will express the same position as France regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement. However, according to Italian newspapers, although Italy criticizes Britain's unilateral actions and disapproves of the method of compromise with Germany used by Britain, it is satisfied with the Anglo-German treaty. Italian officials are not prepared to discuss the Abyssinian issue unless Eden presents specific suggestions from the British government in order to resolve this dispute. The Italian Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated today that even if the Abyssinian issue is raised for discussion, Eden may not have satisfactory suggestions. Italy's attitude can also be seen in this statement. The spokesperson rejected the talk of territorial and commercial concessions, saying that unless there is action to ensure that Abyssinia will no longer harm Italy, Italy cannot and will not withdraw its troops stationed in the territory. The spokesperson also stated that the Italian-Abyssinian conciliation committee, which is scheduled to meet in The Hague tomorrow, does not have the power to resolve the main points of contention between the two countries.

<p>(Rome) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, after winning a diplomatic victory in Paris, dispelling France's doubts about the Anglo-German naval agreement, arrived here from France last night. Italian officials welcomed him as usual. Those who greeted him at the station included Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich, Italian representative to the League of Nations Aloisi, and British Ambassador to Italy Drummond. The talks between Eden and Mussolini will begin today, and if necessary, will continue tomorrow. It is believed that in addition to the naval issue, Britain and Italy will also consider the Western Sky Treaty and the Danube Conference. According to officials here, the Abyssinian issue will not be discussed, but it is believed that this matter may not be completely avoided. It is generally hoped that Eden's visit to Rome will further strengthen the solidarity expressed by Britain, France, and Italy in Stresa. The unilateral act of Britain concluding a naval agreement with Germany has indeed surprised people here, but the Italian government seems to understand Britain's act of compromise with Germany. At the same time, the French ambassador to Italy visited French Prime Minister Laval in Paris and rushed back to Rome on Sunday night, and visited Suvich yesterday morning for consultations. This is a sign of close cooperation between France and Italy due to Eden's mission. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Resolve the Dispute Between Italy and Abyssinia, Eden's Secret Plan</p>
<p>(Rome) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden arrived here today to explain the Anglo-German naval agreement to the Italian authorities. It is heard that Eden has a plan to allow Italy to control Abyssinia. There are only two ways to do this: one is that Britain is willing to allow the League of Nations to allow Italy to establish a protectorate in Abyssinia in its personal capacity. The second is that Britain will persuade Abyssinia to cede the province of Akaton to Italy to avoid further conflict. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<p>(London) News reports said that the British government had ordered Minister Without Portfolio Eden to submit suggestions to the Italian government on resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. This statement was recently denied by British officials, saying that according to the British government, the solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute is within the jurisdiction of the League of Nations, and Britain should not overstep.

<p>(London) According to the Daily Mail, Minister Without Portfolio Eden will propose to the Italian authorities on the Abyssinian issue during his visit to Italy that Britain will fully assist Italy to satisfy Italy's "legitimate demands in Abyssinia" in exchange for a guarantee that Italy will not take military aggression against Abyssinia. The so-called legitimate demands are the right of Italy to build a railway, which passes through Abyssinian territory to connect the Italian territories of Eritrea and Somaliland, the right to use certain water sources and pastures in the Ogaden area of Abyssinia, and the right to develop Limen enterprises in northern Abyssinia. All these rights have been stipulated in the treaty on Abyssinia signed by Britain, France, and Italy in 1906. Moreover, the Anglo-Italian agreement in 1925 also recognized the area where the railway will be built in Abyssinia in the future as the sphere of Italian influence. In addition, it is rumored that Britain has allowed Abyssinia to designate a sea passage in British Somaliland for Abyssinia to use to compensate for the rights that the country has ceded to Italy. Although this statement has not been confirmed, the newspaper believes that it is possible. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although it is generally said that British Minister Without Portfolio Eden will discuss the Anglo-German naval agreement and the Locarno Pact, the "Newspaper" said that the Abyssinian issue will also be discussed, because one of those accompanying Eden to Rome is a Mr. Dion Bombsen, who is a British expert on North Africa and Egypt issues. It is heard that Britain will not spare any cost to maintain peace in East Africa. Britain will probably allow Abyssinia to use the ports along the coast of British Somaliland, and Abyssinia will use a part of its territory for Italian colonization, allow Italy to have trade privileges in Abyssinia, and be able to build a railway that passes purely through Abyssinian territory to connect the Italian ports of Mar Brava and Mogadishu as an exchange condition.

<p>(Paris) The Abyssinian King met with a reporter from the Morning Post in the Abyssinian capital and issued the following statement regarding the mobilization of Muslims on the Abyssinian border: Muhammad himself declared in the Koran that Muslims should help the devout Isaton nation who welcome the Prophet in times of crisis, but now Muslims and the Isaton nation live in harmony and enjoy religious freedom. The King answered the question of whether he hopes for Muslim assistance in the event of war and said that he could not tell about this matter, because this question is purely a hypothesis. We have not made any requests, but we are very harmonious with Muslims, and the Christians in Egypt will also be drawn into the vortex for Italy. The King also denied the claim that Turkish officer Mi Ning will lead the Abyssinian army and finally asked France to support Abyssinia's application to the League of Nations, claiming that he hopes to redefine Abyssinia's borders and that Abyssinia is happy to bear this cost. The King later said that he is making this suggestion now to reaffirm Abyssinia's peaceful aspirations. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>

<p>(London) German representative General Ribbentrop left for Germany today. On the eve of his departure, he met with a Reuters diplomatic reporter. Ribbentrop said that the disarmament issue has been discussed for many years, and the Anglo-German naval agreement is the first real success and the first step towards arms limitation. He meant that Europe had made a mistake and has not yet been corrected, that is, trying to solve various problems of various countries at the same time. Because of this agreement between Britain and Germany, there will be no more naval competition, and we have broken the ice in the European political situation, opening the way to solve other problems. Therefore, the agreement may become a cornerstone of Europe's true stability. Germany firmly believes that Europe bears the mission of the entire civilized world. As for the rumors that Germany intends to alienate Britain and France, they are all lies. This is not the spirit before the flood, but a repetition of the mistakes before the Great War. If we want to see the revival of Western Europe, we must think and believe in a grand strategy. It is said that he takes assisting in the close unity between Britain, France, and Germany as his life's career. This is true. Other European countries will be happy to join this kind of unity.

<p>London Issues Communiqué</p>
<p>(London) Anglo-German naval talks have ended. The Foreign Office issued the following communiqué today: Since the exchange of notes on June 18, Britain and Germany have continued to discuss naval issues. The attitude of both sides is the same as in previous talks with other governments. Both sides have thoroughly exchanged views on the future restrictions and the extent of naval construction. Germany's views and the British government's proposal to conclude a general naval agreement in the future will be notified to the representatives of the countries concerned in future talks. It goes without saying that the exchange of views between the British and German governments is only of a temporary nature, because the final decision depends on the attitude of other countries in the future international naval conference. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Agreed Points Between Britain and Germany</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Express reported that in the Anglo-German naval treaty, Germany agreed never to use submarines to attack merchant ships. Regarding this point, German leader Hitler will issue a declaration in the near future. Britain and Germany have mutually agreed that the two countries' warship construction programs will not be implemented quickly. Germany's warship construction program will be completed by 1942. As for Britain adding new ships to replace old ships, because the Washington Naval Treaty is still valid, it must wait until 1937 to begin construction. The construction project will be extended for several years. The newly-built battleships will not be put into use until 1943. As for the maximum tonnage of submarines, Britain and Germany have agreed to be between 600 and 800 tons. (Havas telegram on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, notified the American government the day before yesterday with a copy of the Anglo-German naval agreement and detailed information about the negotiations. At that time, Deputy Secretary of State Phillips only expressed to the British Ambassador the hope that this agreement could pave the way for universal limitations on naval armaments. He did not express any opinion on the content of the Anglo-German naval agreement. Outside rumors that the US government considered the Anglo-German naval agreement acceptable were denied by the State Department. In short, the US government has not expressed approval or opposition to the Anglo-German naval agreement. This attitude accurately reflects the general public opinion in the United States. The general consensus is that the Anglo-German naval agreement is the most surprising diplomatic development since the war. According to some, while the European air force issue has nothing to do with the United States, any issue concerning the naval ratios of countries around the world is considered by the United States to be directly related to itself. Now, without consulting the United States in advance, Britain has simply changed the German naval system stipulated by treaties through bilateral negotiations. It should be noted that this naval system is not only stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles but also by the US-German peace treaty. Moreover, the United States seeks to maintain naval parity with Britain. The establishment of the Anglo-German naval agreement not only affects the naval policies of France and Italy, but also has a significant impact on the total tonnage of the British Navy. The United States will not turn a blind eye to this. Britain has already decided to build twenty new cruisers in the near future, and rumors are circulating that it will also need to build ten capital ships. After the British general election, there is deep concern that the British government will use Germany's construction of the latest type of fleet as an excuse to implement a large-scale naval construction program. If that is the case, the American shipbuilding program will inevitably be affected. Furthermore, during the Anglo-German naval talks in London, Britain expressed the hope of reducing the tonnage limit of capital ships from 35,000 tons to 25,000 tons, and the gun caliber from 16 inches to 12 inches. The tonnage limit of cruisers would be reduced from 10,000 tons to 7,000 tons, and the gun caliber from 8 inches to 6 inches. The US Navy Department cannot but pay attention to this British proposal. In the 1930 London Naval Conference, the United States firmly refused to reduce the tonnage limit of each battleship. The reason for the US Navy Department's opposition was that the United States has no naval bases in any of the world's major sea lanes. Therefore, the United States must have capital ships with a displacement of 35,000 tons, armed with 16-inch caliber guns, and cruisers with a displacement of 10,000 tons, armed with 8-inch caliber guns, and with a wide range of activities. This position is in direct contrast to the hopes expressed by Britain in these Anglo-German talks in London. Therefore, the US government is paying close attention to it. Furthermore, the general opinion in the United States is that the United States has played a major role in various naval negotiations after the Great War. However, in this Anglo-German naval negotiation, Britain proceeded without regard for the United States, creating a fait accompli in order to force the United States to recognize it. This makes the general American public feel unhappy. Recalling that before the 1920 London Naval Conference, Prime Minister MacDonald personally came to the United States and concluded an agreement with President Hoover on Anglo-American naval parity, and then returned to Britain to announce the matter. Now, Britain is doing the opposite. Comparing the past with the present, one cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitude. Moreover, the United States believes that this attitude of Britain will inevitably arouse repercussions from France and Italy. The Anglo-German naval agreement has overturned the policy of coordination among Britain, France, and Italy established in Rome, London, Stresa, and Geneva in one fell swoop. As for Britain's optimistic view that this new strategy of Britain will enable European diplomacy to change course and open up new avenues, people in the United States dare not agree with it. (23rd Havas)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government intends to use the Anglo-German naval agreement, which was concluded the day before yesterday, as a starting point for a five-nation disarmament agreement between Britain, the United States, France, Japan, and Italy. Moreover, the content of the Anglo-German agreement adopted the principle of classification-based ratios, which Japan absolutely opposes. Therefore, the attitude of the countries concerned is attracting great attention. The New York Times, Washington Post, and other newspapers oppose the Anglo-German naval agreement as follows: (1) Britain's attempt to use the Anglo-German agreement as a model for a general naval disarmament agreement violates Article 18 of the Treaty of Versailles. (2) Britain's measures are fueling Japan's aggression in China, perhaps because there is no hope of an Anglo-American alliance, but it is inappropriate to submit the fait accompli to the disarmament conference.

<p>(Paris) As a result of Eden's visit, the tone of various newspapers this morning has changed regarding Anglo-French relations. Most newspapers express optimism and hope that Britain and France will still agree on other European issues. However, some newspapers are deeply afraid that this hope may not be fully realized. For example, Le Journal stated that whether the Stresa Front can be restored depends on Eden's decision after returning from Rome. Le Petit Parisien expressed satisfaction with the results of Eden's talks with Laval, stating that the consensus between France and Britain, although temporarily affected by the Anglo-German agreement, has now returned to its original state. Paris Soir insists that the Anglo-French London Protocol of February 3 has become invalid. Laval had hoped that Britain would resolve all issues in the protocol at the same time. Although it is possible to negotiate each issue separately to avoid hindering other issues due to one problem, the final decision was not to deviate from the scope of the protocol. The reply Eden received from London expressed optimism, but a concrete decision on this matter must await the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. (23rd National Telegram)</p>

Whether it is the general principles of French foreign policy, or the attitude towards naval or air agreements, France has never changed. Because in the current situation, France really has a mission to fulfill, which does not mean that France must refuse to participate in expert negotiations on naval or air issues. What we should declare is that we should restore freedom of action. Although our interests in Europe are closely related, just as they are to the interests of France itself, therefore we must make Britain fully aware and have a more accurate understanding of German affairs before we can."

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance held a meeting at 1:30 p.m. on the 24th to discuss the guidelines for formulating next year's budget, and decided to adopt the principle of sound finance, harmonize national defense and finance, and suppress budget expansion. (24th Japan Federation Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is expected that next year's budget will inevitably cause waves due to the Ministry of Finance's policy of gradually reducing public bonds and the military's request for increased funds. The government, in view of the crisis in the cabinet caused by the conflict between the former Minister of Finance Fujii and the Minister of the Army last year, is quite vigilant about future trends, but trusts the Minister of Finance's skills and maintains an optimistic attitude. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance acknowledge that the increase in national defense spending is necessary and indispensable due to the international situation. On the one hand, the military also believes that next year's budget should be limited to a transitional budget, just like this year's. The fundamental plan for national defense must wait for the results of the disarmament conference before it can be started after the next year, so it is not difficult to find a point of reconciliation. Secondly, regarding the issue of harmonizing national defense finance, it is planned to re-submit the three bills on raw silk fertilizer that failed to be established in the previous parliament, and wait for the deliberation of the cabinet deliberation committee, and then take emergency measures to avoid accusations of disregarding the countryside.

The amount, excluding the 150 million for Manchurian Incident expenses, is about 400 million yuan. The army also believes that national defense spending must still be huge due to Prime Minister Okada's remarks on the situation on the 19th. Therefore, it has taken special pains to reconcile finance and national defense. Therefore, it requests the necessary funding. If the financial authorities have any hope, they will disclose (1) the reorganization of the financial and tax system, (1) the low-interest refinancing of public bonds, (1) the issuance of public bonds within a certain limit, and (1) the re-negotiation of special accounts.

<h3 id="e40">Bomb Thrown in Front of the US Embassy in Mexico City; Possibly Done by a Patriotic Organization; Only Windows Damaged, No Significant Losses <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Mexico City: Today, someone threw a bomb into the US Embassy, ​​destroying many windows, but there was no major loss. Local medical authorities cannot fully explain the cause of this incident. Recently, President Cárdenas and former President Calles had differences of opinion, and the whole city felt uneasy. However, the United States and other powers were not involved in this matter. The general public believes that today's bomb was the result of recent rogue marches in the streets. It is still remembered that when US Ambassador Daniels came here two and a half years ago, his relationship with the former president was very close, and patriotic organizations and some newspapers in Mexico opposed him because he was the Secretary of the Navy when the US Navy occupied Mexican territory in 1915. However, after Daniels took office, he was very friendly with the Mexican people. Recently, Daniels praised former President Calles in a speech, which caused displeasure among those who opposed Calles, but there is no evidence to prove that today's bombing was done by that faction.

<p>Beijing Correspondence, The Hebei issue and Zhangbei Incident, through repeated negotiations, the Hebei issue is generally resolved, the remaining outstanding matters are awaiting the acting chairman of the Political Readjustment Committee, Wang Kemin, to discuss with the Japanese side's Sakai and Doihara in Beijing. Wang arrived in Tianjin this morning (22nd) and met Sakai in the afternoon. Doihara is waiting for Wang in Beijing, and a detailed consultation on the Zhangbei Incident will be held after Wang arrives in Beijing tomorrow. Regarding the Zhangbei Incident, since the chairman of Chahar, Song Zheyuan, has been dismissed, he will immediately come to Beijing and transfer to Tianjin. The chairmanship will be taken over by Qin Dechun. The position of commander of the 29th Army is temporarily entrusted to Zhang Zizhong, commander of the 38th Division, to be responsible. Song himself is recuperating in Tianjin and will not go elsewhere for the time being. The central government is devising other arrangements for the 29th Army's defense area. The 132nd Division troops originally stationed in the Zhangbei area have recently moved south to Wanquan. Once the defense area is determined, they will all be transferred elsewhere. Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou responsible for negotiating the Zhangbei Incident, arrived in Beijing a few days ago and is waiting to meet with Qin Dechun. Qin arrived in Beijing this morning (22nd) and agreed with Matsui to start negotiations tomorrow (23rd). According to Qin's remarks to reporters, the Zhangbei negotiations are being consulted directly and indirectly by relevant parties and have not yet reached a final resolution. He personally adheres to the greatest sincerity in handling this matter. As for the important aspects of the steps involved, he must report and ask for instructions from the central government. After having some contact with the negotiation matters in Beijing, he will go to Tianjin in a private capacity to visit the former chairman Song Zheyuan for his illness, etc. According to Matsui's remarks, he will meet with Qin Dechun on the Zhangbei Incident and conduct the first step of negotiations. The detailed method, whether to discuss it in Beijing or Zhangjiakou, must be decided after meeting Qin.</p>
<p>The position of Tianjin Mayor was initially announced as Wang Kemin's appointment, but Wang's consent was not obtained beforehand. Wang strongly declined the position. This time, he came north to take the position of acting chairman of the Political Readjustment Committee, with the condition that he would not take the position of Tianjin Mayor. Therefore, the central government temporarily ordered Shang Zhen to serve concurrently. Shang's acting as this position is temporary in nature. The official successor is currently being searched for, but there are quite a few competitors at present. (June 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Baoding for Days, Troops Stationed in Baoding Have Completed Transfer, 4,000 Special Police Arrive in Baoding to Add Defenses <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence, After the Hebei Provincial Government moved to Baoding, Baoding has become the capital of the province. The once silent and desolate Baoding city has gradually revealed a lively scene. All industries such as inns and restaurants have benefited threefold. The population of the entire city has also increased by 5,000 to 6,000 people compared to before. At the beginning of the provincial government's move to Baoding, the 51st Army under the command of Yu Xuezhong followed and moved to Baoding to maintain the security of the provincial capital. Later, Yu's troops were transferred to Shaanxi to suppress bandits. The 2nd Division of Huang Jie, originally stationed in Baoding, was ordered to move to Xuzhou. The defense of Baoding city was empty, and with the repeated reconnaissance of Japanese planes in Baoding in recent days, people were panicked to the extreme. The provincial government plans to transfer 4,000 special police officers from Caicun to Baoding to maintain the security of the provincial capital. The Military Branch will also transfer the 2nd Cavalry Division of the 32nd Army to station in the urban and rural areas of Baoding to assist in defense. The current situation of various parties here and the situation of various armies passing through Baoding and Nankai are described separately below.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Daily</p>
<p>Since June 15th, Japanese aircraft have been coming to Baoding for reconnaissance several times every day. Their pretext is to investigate whether our army is opening south. Since June 15th, Japanese aircraft must fly from the northeast along the Pinghan Railway at 11:00 am or 10:40 am every day. When they fly over the city of Baoding, they fly around several times, and then fly southwest along the Pinghan Railway. Every time the Japanese aircraft arrive, they must first go to the Nanguan Airport and the 24th Cavalry Brigade's defense area to fly low and inspect. Previously, on the morning of the 17th, at 10:00 am, two Japanese aircraft came to Baoding, and one actually landed at Nanguan Airport. The next day, a person from Nanxiang came to talk, saying that the landed Japanese aircraft carried three Japanese people, all of whom got off the plane and spied near Nanfang Tongren Middle School for a long time before boarding the plane and taking off. In recent days, they have come to Baoding without interruption, causing extreme panic among the people.</p>
<p>Yu's Troops Have All Left</p>
<p>After Yu Xuezhong was transferred to the commander of the bandit suppression area in the three provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, Yu's 51st Army was ordered to move to Fengxiang, Shaanxi. The three divisions under the jurisdiction of the army, Chen Guanqun, Du Jiwu, and Li Zhentang, have all left Baoding and gone to Zhengzhou one after another, and then entered Shaanxi. The eight departments of the military headquarters also left Baoding for Shaanxi on the 17th, led by Chief of Staff Liu Zhonggan. Currently, the vanguard troops and military personnel have arrived in Fengxiang, Shaanxi, to arrange everything. The personnel remaining in Baoding will also go to Shaanxi on the 20th. Baoding has no remnants of the 51st Army. Yu Xuezhong himself is now going to Sichuan to meet Chiang and, after meeting Chiang and asking for instructions, will go directly to Fengxiang to organize the Bandit Suppression Command.</p>
<p>17th Army Headquarters Moved to Nanjing</p>
<p>The headquarters of the 17th Army, originally stationed in Baoding Guangyuan, was originally planned to be transferred to Beiping when the provincial government moved to Baoding, but it was not realized. Therefore, the Military Commission changed the deployment of the army headquarters to Nanjing. Currently, the personnel of the army and the guard battalion have completely left Baoding for the south on the 20th, and passed through Zhengzhou to Nanjing. As for the Guangyuan houses, they will be vacated for the Finance Department to occupy. Currently, the 17th Army Headquarters has all been moved out, and the Finance Department should have moved into Guangyuan to work.</p>
<p>The First Division of the Army Moved to Xuzhou</p>
<p>The 2nd Division of the Army, commanded by Huang Jie, was originally stationed in the suburbs of Baoding, and the division headquarters was located in the palace. The division has now been ordered to move to Xuzhou. The 4th Brigade, the 6th Brigade, and the 24th Cavalry Brigade under its command have successively passed through Baoding. Huang Jie himself and the division headquarters also went south on the 21st, passing through Zhengzhou to Xuzhou. More than 60 representatives of various agencies in Baoding specially held a public banquet for Huang at Lianhua Pond the other day. During the banquet, Huang gave a passionate speech, and all the participants were in tears. Huang's family also went south with him the other day.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Is Being Reorganized</p>
<p>After the provincial government moved to Baoding, the Baoding Special Public Security Bureau was originally scheduled to be reorganized into the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. At the 626th regular meeting of the provincial government, Zhang Houwan, the acting chairman, specifically proposed the reorganization of the Public Security Bureau, which was passed as proposed and issued a notice on the 21st, stating that the Baoding Special Public Security Bureau should be reorganized into the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. Miao Zuoxin was commissioned to act as the director. On the same day, the provincial government also instructed the bureau to immediately abolish the Special Public Security Bureau and change it to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. After receiving the order, the bureau complied with the order and began reorganization. Although the internal structure has been slightly expanded, it is still being streamlined. Due to the limited funding, the number of police officers has been temporarily decided not to increase. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the provincial government has come to Baoding, the bureau is planning a comprehensive prevention plan for the security of Baoding. All police positions and traffic arteries, as well as city gates and stations, have been ordered to be properly maintained.</p>
<p>Special Police Arrive in Baoding to Add Defenses</p>
<p>After the departure of the 51st Army, the 17th Army, and the 2nd Division, the defense of Baoding was deeply felt to be empty. Although there are a small number of police and security teams from the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to maintain security, their strength is still weak. Moreover, the security of the four suburbs is particularly important. Therefore, the provincial government decided to transfer 4,000 special police officers trained previously from Caicun to add defenses. It is said that there are a total of 9,000 special police officers, and 5,000 have already entered the so-called war zone, while the remaining 4,000 are still in Caicun. Furthermore, the 2nd Cavalry Division of the 32nd Army will also be moved to the four suburbs of Baoding. Currently, the deputy officer of the division has been sent to Baoding to survey the defense area. They will be able to come soon. (June 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Haiqi and Hai琛 Ships: Escape from Guangdong Waters, Anchoring in Hong Kong for Coal and Food Resupply; Jiang Xiyuan Detained in Guangzhou <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Haiqi and Hai琛 ships, since secretly escaping from Huangpu on the evening of the 15th, were discovered by the Huangpu garrison's salt police and special task force, who used door guns to stop them. At the same time, the fish farm and Changzhou forts opened fire and bombarded them. The Haiqi ships also fired back, fighting and retreating, until they ran aground near Lianhua Mountain at the exit of the East River. At this time, the provincial military authorities, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched airplanes to pursue them. The two ships then used delaying tactics, sending three representatives to the province on the evening of the 16th, requesting repentance and begging Guangdong to re-accept them and not pursue past offenses. Chen Jitang expressed his opinion, saying that if the two ships were willing to stay, other solutions could be discussed, otherwise, their departure was not a pity. As for the negotiation and mediation methods, the headquarters drafted three responses, roughly: 1. The Haiqi and Hai琛 ships must sail back to Huangpu; 2. All officers and soldiers of the two ships must disembark in Huangpu to listen to instructions; 3. The issue of salary payments will be considered again. However, while the representatives were replying, there was a sudden downpour, and the two ships believed that the time had come. Taking advantage of the heavy rain and darkness, the airplanes could not take off to pursue them, and the tide was high at this time, so they immediately fired up their engines and sailed past Humen. At that time, the Humen forts opened fire to intercept them, and the Haiqi and Hai琛 ships also fired back, defending themselves. After an hour of fierce battle, the searchlight of the Humen fort was destroyed by artillery fire, reducing the target for the two ships, and they were able to break through Humen, sailing along Jinxingmen and Tangjiawan in Zhongshan, across Lingdingyang, and toward Chiwan in Hong Kong's territorial waters. When the two ships left, they had already sent a telegram to Hong Kong, saying that there were wounded soldiers who would land in Hong Kong and be sent to the hospital for treatment. On the 17th, around 6:00 AM, the two ships anchored in the waters of Chiwan, engaged in internal repairs. Then, four wounded soldiers from the Haiqi ship were sent to Hong Kong by boat and admitted to the National Hospital for treatment. After the Haiqi ship anchored in Chiwan, it sent personnel to Hong Kong for several days to purchase coal and food, preparing to set sail for other destinations at any time. It is said that when the two ships launched the mutiny, the captain of the Haiqi ship, Chen Hao, was tied up by the officers and soldiers. The captain of the Hai琛 ship, Fang Nianzu, was fortunately not on board. When the mutiny was launched, it was commanded by a Tang, the former captain of the Fu You ship. The hull of the Haiqi ship was damaged by airplane bombs and fort artillery fire, reaching almost four-tenths of the entire ship. After the two ships arrived in Hong Kong waters, Guangdong lifted martial law, and ship traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong was restored. The garrison near Huangpu was also withdrawn. Li Jiezhi, the commander of the Humen Fortress, came to the province on the 18th to report the interception of the two ships. Zhang Zhiying, the vice commander of the Navy, accompanied by the chief of staff, took a ship to Huangpu on the 18th to inspect the area and summon students from the naval academy for instruction. Furthermore, the naval vice commander, Jiang Xiyuan (Yan Zhong), was not involved in the vortex this time, although he had no responsibility to bear. However, the authorities believed that the Bohai Fleet was led by Jiang to the south, and this time, the Haiqi and Hai琛 ships mutinied, not without suspicion, so Jiang was detained for investigation.

<h3 id="e78">Wuhan Suffers Several Days of Heavy Rain, the Yangtze River Rises Sharply; Collapse of Houses in Heavy Rain, a Tragic Event with Nearly 100 Deaths and Injuries; Zhang Qun Postpones Departure for Dike Inspection Due to Official Trip to Beijing <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer, the climate in Wuhan has been extremely hot, and the Fahrenheit thermometer has reached 100 degrees. The citizens were hoping for rain very eagerly. On the 19th of this month, heavy rain suddenly fell, lasting for several days, and the temperature dropped to 70 degrees. It was still cold even with lined clothing, just like late spring or mid-autumn. The water level of the Yangtze River increased daily. On the 22nd, the rain was even heavier, and it did not stop until the next morning. Coupled with thunder and lightning, it continued all night. Low-lying streets and markets were all turned into swamps, and transportation was blocked as a result. The homes of poor people outside the Pinghan Railway were especially flooded, and the poor people were living in the water, suffering greatly. At dawn on the 23rd, the city government began to build temporary sheds along Zhongzheng Road to accommodate them as much as possible. During the heavy rain, the houses at Nos. 342, 344, and 346 of Maishantang Street outside Zhongshan Road suddenly collapsed. Because it was late at night, and the event was sudden, hundreds of residents were either killed or injured, with no one spared. Also, in the prosperous area of Houshengli at the entrance of Zhongshan Road, the water was two feet deep, drowning a Ding姓 child, which was also tragic. As for the water level of the Yangtze River, it rose sharply by 1.2 meters on the 23rd, and the Jianghan Customs water mark reached 35.7 feet, not far from the shore. The Wuhan Flood Prevention Association, considering the situation to be very serious, began working day and night from now on to avoid danger. Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun originally planned to depart with Yang Silian, director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, to inspect the dikes in various counties, but he was temporarily summoned by President Wang on the evening of the 22nd to take the Jianghua liner to Beijing to discuss important matters and could not go. Yang is scheduled to depart on the 24th. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Qiantang River Water Level Rises Suddenly, Sea Dike Silt Washed Away Dozens of Feet; Zhuji Dongbi Lake Dike Collapses; Hangzhou-Huizhou and Hangzhou-Fuyang Highways are Blocked <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Continuous heavy rain has caused the water level of the Qiantang River to rise sharply. Furthermore, mountain water from the upper reaches flowed downstream, causing the Qiantang River water level at the Zhakou to suddenly rise to 8.1 meters, an increase of more than 2 meters compared to before. On the 23rd, the water continued to recede, and the water level continued to rise to 8.6 meters. The Nanfeng and Xixing wharves were once submerged by water. The situation was quite critical. The Hangzhou Municipal Government and the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau dispatched personnel to inspect the sea dikes. If there were any accidents, they would immediately send workers to rescue them. Fortunately, the situation eased slightly in the evening, and the water level dropped by 2.3 centimeters. Today (24th), the rain has stopped and the sky has cleared. According to the report from the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the highest water level has dropped to 7.5 meters. If a large amount of mountain water from the upper reaches does not continue to attack, the sea dike should not be in danger. Furthermore, the Department of Construction, according to a telegram from the Hangzhou Sea Dike Engineering Office, reported that the silt outside the dike in the area from Babu to Tasan in Haining was eroded by huge waves, and dozens of feet had collapsed. The newly built submerged dam was also destroyed, and the dike body was in a dangerous state. It immediately sent the responsible section staff Jiang Min to investigate and strictly supervise prevention and rescue, and protect the dike body. Also, the province received an urgent telegram from Zhuji County reporting that the Dongbi Lake dike was destroyed by floods and was completely submerged. Work could no longer proceed, and 500 workers had stopped working. County Magistrate Li Yuguang happened to be in the province on official business and had discussed prevention and rescue measures with the Water Conservancy Bureau. Furthermore, on the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway, about 20 kilometers from the Zhejiang border Yuling Pass at Zhongling, mountain soil on the ridge was washed away by heavy rain on the 23rd. With a crash, it poured onto the road below the mountain, crushing more than a dozen civilian houses along the road, and six or seven farmers were crushed to death because they could not escape in time. The Hangzhou-Huizhou direct passenger car only ran to Yuling Pass due to road damage. The Yushu Company has dispatched workers to rush repairs, and traffic is expected to resume in about two days. Furthermore, the water on the Hangzhou-Fuyang Highway rose by two feet in the Gaotai and Fuyang sections due to the large increase in mountain water that could not be discharged, and traffic was blocked. The water level gradually receded this afternoon, and traffic can resume normally tomorrow (25th). According to Mao Yisheng, director of the Qiantang River Bridge Engineering Office, the large increase in the Qiantang River water level, although inevitably slightly hindered the bridge project, but did not have much impact.

<h3 id="e80">Songjiang: Rice Merchant Mysteriously Disappears from Zhanggang <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Cao Lingfeng, a businessman who runs a rice business in Zhangjiagang, more than one li south of Shihudang, has been relatively successful in recent years. However, he has been affected by the economic downturn and has little savings. He suddenly disappeared yesterday morning, which is quite strange. According to reports, neighbors had not seen the Cao family open their door around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, and they were suspicious. They tried to enter the house and found it empty. It was unclear where they had suddenly gone. They then saw writing on the wall, roughly saying that they would reply within a few days. Whether they were kidnapped or murdered is being discussed, and a strict investigation is needed to confirm.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been two cases in this city of true cholera that were treated and died. One was A Jun, a tea worker from the tax collection office, who suddenly felt severe abdominal pain and diarrhea a few days ago. He was sent to Ruose Hospital for diagnosis and treatment that night, but eventually died yesterday. The other was A Shi, the daughter of a comb maker on Fozibqiao, who also had severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea a few days ago. The diagnosis was true cholera, and she died soon after. Some say that the unclean water is an important cause.</p>

<p>During the heyday of silk factories in the 18th year of the Republic of China, there were more than 20 remittance banks in this city. Later, as the silk market declined and silk factories closed down, the remittance banks suffered heavy losses as a result and could not maintain operations, and they closed down one after another. Only Chenghengfeng, Fuyuan, Shenyu, Yuanfengsheng, Ruichang, Fuyu, De, Changsheng, and Zengda and other nine are left. There are 11 banks, including China, Communications, Jiangsu, Farmers, Shanghai, Mainland, Central South, Industry, Communications, Industry, and Xinhua. Because of their strong capital and stable lending, their business is booming, and they have a surplus. Banks mostly pay attention to collateral when lending, and there is very little credit lending, so the failure of silk factories did not have much impact on banks. When spring cocoons were put on the market this year, only more than 1.5 million loans were issued. This time, wheat is being put on the market, and the rice industry urgently needs loans, but the financial sector has tightened lending to the extreme, and the situation is quite deserted, less than one-third of what it was in previous years. Furthermore, there are 32 silk factories in the entire county, with 9,490 silk looms. Some of them are still operating on behalf of others. In addition, industries such as silk fabrics and Nanhua can only maintain expenses. Social finance is becoming increasingly difficult, and it is difficult to be optimistic about the future of business.</p>

<p>On September 5th last year, the County Public Security Bureau arrested eight drug pellet criminals, including Chen Shaokun, in Nanyangli No. 10 and Silangjun Lane No. 1 inside Guangfumen, and seized 109,000 drug pellets. They were presented to the county government and then to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters. Chen Shaokun has now been sentenced to life imprisonment, Wang Hushi to 15 years imprisonment, Hu Qiushi and Yang Axue to 13 years each, Chen Yangshi to 12 years, and Yang Shishi, Chen Zhushi, and Wu Yike were acquitted. They were sent back to the Wuxi County Government yesterday for separate execution.</p>

<p>At about 9:00 PM on the 22nd, seven or eight robbers suddenly came to the home of Ma Tingzhen, a villager in Guguxiang, Qidong District. They broke into the house, tied up Ma, and forbade him from making a sound. Then, they turned over boxes and cabinets and searched at will. They left after a long time. Then, they went to the homes of neighbors Tang Yongkang and Wu Chaosheng to search. Wu resisted with weapons and was shot in the abdomen by the robbers and fell to the ground and died. At the time, the villagers heard the alarm and gathered to surround and arrest them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers took the stolen goods and fled. After inventory, Ma Tingzhen's family lost five yuan in banknotes, five bolts of white cloth, and three cloth tents. Tang Shuikang's family lost five bolts of white cloth, and Wu Chaosheng's family lost more than ten pieces of clothing. On the 23rd, the victim reported to the county government, and Chai Cheng arrived to inspect the scene. Wu Chaosheng was indeed shot and killed by robbers. The family was ordered to collect the body and await the arrest and investigation of the murderer.</p>

<p>The current secretary of the Executive Yuan, Zhu Qi, is President Wang's nephew. He graduated from the University of Paris in France. Recently, through the introduction of Mr. Chu Minyi and Chen Yunwen, he was engaged to Ms. He, a fellow villager. On the 22nd, a wedding ceremony was held at the Nanjing Overseas Chinese Hostel. Mr. Chen Shuren was the wedding officiant. President Wang, feeling the economic downturn, market depression, and difficult resources in society, advocated frugality and abolished all the complicated formalities of old-fashioned marriages. He did not send out wedding invitations widely in advance, so few people outside the family knew about it except for a few relatives and friends. On the day, only Zeng Zhongming, Xu Mo, and dozens of relatives and friends attended. After the wedding ceremony, everyone was treated with tea and snacks, each of which was only worth five cents. The total cost was about 100 yuan. Such a simple and frugal wedding, done by a party-state leader, is even more commendable. When people across the country hold weddings, if there is no place to gather and hold weddings, they can all be used as models.</p>

At the same time, it continued to focus on lending to rural villages to provide relief. Now, after Chen's departure as acting manager, the department appointed Shen Xianheng as manager. In order to facilitate farmers in rural areas to borrow money nearby, Manager Shen has established rural bank offices in four locations in the county's third district (Wangjiangjing), fourth district (Xinteng), fifth district (Wangdian), and seventh district (Xinfeng). Preparations have been completed, and directors have been appointed and trainees recruited. They will open on July 1st.</p>

<p>Xiaosibu, Toutong Township, Dongxiang, Xiaoshan, is located on the opposite bank of Haining County and is densely populated. There were originally about 30,000 mu of sand land along the river, but in recent years, the river has changed drastically, and the tides are unprecedentedly high. Therefore, the river has collapsed in less than a year, and 10,000 mu of mature sand land have been lost to the ocean. Many residents have moved away. Recently, the river collapse there has been serious, and the situation is extremely dangerous. For example, the Gao Zhengxing Public Office base and Shaodui street base there have already fallen into the water, and the street houses are being demolished one after another, and some are even unable to move. The poor and helpless people are suffering the disaster of river collapse, displaced and filled with wailing, which is unbearable to witness. It is hoped that the authorities will find ways to provide relief.</p>

<p>The conference of directors of the stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus of the Tax Administration closed yesterday morning. The closing ceremony was originally scheduled to be held in the Joonpoo Bureau conference room on the fifth floor of the Jianghai Customs. Around ten o'clock, the directors of various provincial bureaus, Zhao Xien, Sheng Shengyuan, Ding Chungao, etc., and the director of the Tax Administration, Wu Qiding, as well as 29 people from the secretary section of the administration, arrived at the meeting one after another. The order of the closing ceremony was: 1. All stood at attention; 2. Paid the highest respect to the party-state flag and the portrait of the Premier; 3. The chairman respectfully read the Premier's will; 4. Silence; 5. The Minister of Finance delivered a speech; 6. The Director delivered a speech; 7. The directors of various provincial bureaus gave replies. Then, Director Wu went to the Central Bank to ask Minister Kong for instructions, who instructed him to change the venue to the conference hall on the third floor of the Central Bank. Director Wu then invited everyone to go there. The ceremony began at half past eleven and ended around one o'clock. The instructions of Minister Kong and Director Wu, and the replies of the directors of the provincial bureaus are recorded below.</p>
<p>Minister's Instructions</p>
<p>Minister Kong said in his instructions: Today is the closing day of the conference. You will soon be returning to your posts. I would like to take this opportunity to offer a few words of farewell, and I hope you will be mindful of the difficulties of the times and pay close attention to them. You have been appointed by the government to manage the salt administration of the provincial bureaus, and your responsibilities are extremely important. You must know that in our service, the first thing is to be worthy of the country, and the second is to be worthy of our conscience. Now that the country is in great difficulty, we must do our best to rectify things to increase tax revenue. You must know that as provincial bureau directors, not only must you be honest and restrained yourselves, but you must also be responsible for the people you employ. If the people you employ make even a small mistake, it is your own fault. I have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from Chairman Chiang, who often mentions the corruption in tax collection agencies in various places. During this suppression period, most provinces are under the jurisdiction of the Headquarters, and if corruption is found, it can be dealt with at any time according to the law. Do not let the corruption of your subordinates implicate yourselves, so you must take self-cleanliness as the first priority. The stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes, the stamp tax has now been changed to be sold by the post office, and the long-standing malpractices have been eliminated. The bureaus only need to earnestly extract funds, and the sales volume will naturally increase day by day. As for tobacco and alcohol, they are consumer goods, and the tax rates in various countries are very high, and they are easy to manage because they are manufactured in factories. China's industry is underdeveloped, and the production of tobacco and alcohol has always been very scattered, especially in the south, which is prone to abuses in collection. In the face of this situation, how should we rectify the tax system? The country is vast, and the situation in each province is different, and even within a province, the situation in different places may be different. How to rectify, how to increase tax revenue, how to promote benefits, and how to eliminate abuses, you must adapt to local conditions, make plans in advance, and put yourselves aside in advance, and act as a third party, so that it is easier to achieve results. The country sets up officials to hold office, and the emphasis is on public affairs. We should serve with the country as the premise, and not treat it as our personal property. As long as we are in office for one day, we should fulfill our responsibilities for one day. All ideas for promoting benefits and eliminating abuses should be contributed as much as possible. Selfishness and self-interest should be thoroughly eliminated, and even requests and favors should be completely eliminated. In the past, officials mostly protected each other, so politics did not get on track. Now we are in an extraordinary period, and we must all cheer up and work hard to save the country, so that the country has a solution. Finance is the mother of all administrations, and no construction can be carried out without money. Tax administration, whether large or small, should pay attention to benefiting the country and facilitating commerce. Mount Tai does not choose soil, and the rivers and seas do not choose small streams, but are formed by accumulation. At present, various provinces often ask for increased funding because of their vast land area and insufficient budget, but they do not know that nothing is immutable. If they can adapt to the times and allocate funds properly, it is not impossible to find a solution. This conference was able to cooperate fully, and I hope that after you return to your bureaus, you will proceed according to the resolutions and your experience, so that both national taxes and commercial sentiment will benefit. This is what I hope for.</p>
<p>Director's Speech</p>
<p>Director of the Tax Administration Wu Qiding then delivered a closing speech, saying: During this conference, you have traveled long distances without fear of fatigue, and your loyalty and sincerity are deeply admired. The long-standing malpractices of the tobacco and alcohol taxes and the difficulties of the business operations of merchants and people are the foundation for urgent rectification. In the opening speech, I briefly described the outline, and I was honored to have the Minister personally give instructions, which were earnest, detailed, and clear. Hearing this made me feel fearful and inspired me to redouble my efforts. I believe that you all share the same feeling. This conference received more than 20 proposals, which were all realistic and pragmatic, and did not focus on empty talk and lofty theories. The participating provinces, from Heng and Xiang in the south to Yan and Ji in the north, and from Min and Jiangxi in the east to Ezhou in the west, gathered together, calmly discussed, and formulated regulations, completing the work quickly. The actual difficulties of various provinces have been conveyed to the central government, and the thorny deployments have been announced to various provinces, and the advantages and disadvantages of tax affairs between provinces have been explained to each other, communicating feelings, eliminating borders, and showing sincerity to each other, so as to obtain cooperation. I am deeply grateful for your ability to cooperate fully. Once the resolutions are submitted to the Ministry for approval, they can be implemented separately. Politics values action, and matters value practice. Our country has always advocated formalism, and there are often errors in valuing reality and following the name. The matters resolved this time are all plans made by you based on your knowledge and experience. Once approved, it is hoped that they will be earnestly implemented and fully realized, and not just entrusted to empty words. The Ministry uses it to task the Administration, the Administration uses it to task the provincial bureaus, and the provincial bureaus use it to task the branch bureaus, with layers of restrictions, aiming for a goal, rewarding the successful and punishing the unsuccessful, and dismissing the dishonest. Everything should be based on the law, without any pretense, so that sitting and talking can lead to action, and results can be seen quickly, both to live up to the Minister's earnest expectations and to save the merchants and people from their plight. Therefore, I always encourage myself, and I also hope that you gentlemen will be able to work together and achieve success together.</p>
<p>Directors' Replies</p>
<p>Zhao Xien, the director of the Zhejiang Bureau, and Sheng Shengyuan, the director of the Jiangsu Bureau, successively gave replies, the general meaning of which was that this conference had been greatly assisted by the Minister twice. After returning to their posts, they would earnestly implement the resolutions of the conference, taking personality as the primary support, aiming at benefiting the country and facilitating commerce, not avoiding difficulties, not resigning from complaints, and working hard to make the country's finances benefit. However, the directors have limited talent and knowledge, and I hope that you will guide and encourage us at any time, which is what we hope for.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau Expands Simple Life Insurance; Adds Three More Units Besides the Original One; Plans to Hold Service Personnel Training in Shanghai Regularly <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation is actively preparing to establish simple life insurance services in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou. The insurance division within the Bureau is also expanding its scope, adding three units, and plans to conduct training for working service personnel on a regular basis. Once the simple life insurance regulations are approved, it will officially commence operations. The details are as follows, as reported by a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao:</p>
<p>Joint Efforts in Three Locations</p>
<p>The state-run simple life insurance was ordered by the Ministry of Transportation to the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to first establish branches in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou, and then promote it throughout the country. In Shanghai, in addition to the Bureau and the Shanghai Postal Administration jointly preparing in the branch offices in various important areas such as Nanshi, Zhabei, the French Concession, and the International Settlement, it also ordered the Nanjing Savings and Remittances Branch and the Jiangsu District Postal Administration, the Hankou Savings and Remittances Branch and the Hubei District Postal Administration to jointly prepare. A simple life insurance department will be established first in each branch office, and the sub-branches below the branch office will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Expanding Internal Scope</p>
<p>The insurance division of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau originally had only one unit, handling various general insurance and mail insurance matters. Now, due to the addition of simple life insurance, the workload has increased, so three more units have been added. It is stipulated that the first, second, and third units will specialize in handling simple life insurance matters, as well as general insurance. The fourth unit will be responsible for insurance for mail and packages. Each unit was established within the past week, and the number of staff has also been increased accordingly.</p>
<p>Training Service Personnel</p>
<p>The simple life insurance business is a new venture in China, entirely state-run, and different in nature from the insurance offered by ordinary foreign companies. The procedures and internal organization are very complex. In order to train personnel to handle this business, the Savings and Remittances Bureau has stipulated that each branch office in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou will select one or two current postal and savings and remittances staff members for short-term training. The location is set at the Shanghai Bureau. Preparations for the opening of the class have already begun. After this group of service personnel is trained, they will indirectly train the staff of the sub-branches.</p>
<p>Implementation Delayed Beyond July 1st</p>
<p>Regarding the official start date of simple life insurance, the Ministry of Transportation originally planned to implement it from July 1st. Yesterday, according to Zhang Mingxin, Deputy Director of the Insurance Department, the Simple Life Insurance Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. After the Bureau drafted 75 articles of regulations and submitted them to the Ministry of Transportation for instructions, the Ministry forwarded them to the Executive Yuan in accordance with legal procedures. So far, they have not been approved. At the same time, the preparatory procedures in various places are complicated and time-consuming, so it is estimated that it will not be implemented until early August.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry, considering that the fish market built by the ministry in Shanghai is scheduled to be completed next month, specially dispatched Yao Huanzhou, a member of the fish market preparation committee, to Qingdao and Dalian to inspect the various conditions of the fish markets in various places in order to have reference materials. After receiving the order, Yao left Shanghai on the 4th of this month and visited Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, and other places. He has now completed the inspection and returned to Shanghai yesterday by the Dalian Maru. According to Yao, when speaking to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the inspection of the fish markets in Qingdao and Dalian has lasted three weeks. There are two fish markets in Qingdao and Dalian, one run by the Chinese and one run by the Japanese. The one run by the Chinese has an annual turnover of approximately 300,000 yuan, while the one run by the Japanese has an annual turnover of 2.3 million yuan. The fish market in Dalian is entirely run by the Japanese, with an annual turnover of 4 million yuan. The fish market in Shanghai will be completed next month and will start operations at the end of August. It is estimated that the annual turnover will reach 20 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: The Jiahe Wheel Did Not Collide with the Buoy <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Jiahe wheel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company entered from Xiamen on the 20th of this month and was reported to have hit the Taikoo buoy at the Xin Kai River. It was reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a letter from Taikoo requesting compensation, the company inquired with the captain and crew of the Jiahe wheel, who all stated that there was no collision with the buoy. Moreover, after on-site inspection, although the lower end of the buoy was damaged, there were no scratch marks on the paint on the upper end. If the degree of damage to the lower section of the buoy is observed, the blades of the Jiahe wheel would inevitably be damaged. Now, after sending someone into the water to inspect, the Jiahe wheel blades are not damaged at all, which clearly shows that it was not the Jiahe wheel that collided. The company firmly denies the accusation based on the facts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was previously reported in this newspaper that after the Jiahe wheel collided with the buoy, the insurance company was notified to send personnel to inspect and repair it. According to the regulations, collisions of ships with docks and buoys are not within the scope of insurance compensation, so the insurance company is not responsible.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Seamen's Organizations Oppose Salary Cuts; Shipping Guild Issues Statement Yesterday, Defending 20% Salary Reduction <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to the *Shen Shi News*, due to declining business and internal cost-cutting, the member companies of the Shanghai Shipping Guild recently decided to reduce the monthly salaries of seamen earning above 15 yuan by 20% starting from July 1st. Upon hearing this news, over a dozen seamen's organizations, including the Chinese Marine Engineers Association, the Chinese Captains Association, and the Wireless Operators Public Welfare Association, expressed deep dissatisfaction. They considered this decision to have a significant impact on the livelihoods of seamen and vehemently opposed it, issuing declarations accordingly. In addition, various sailors' organizations such as Yan Ying Nan She also unanimously issued urgent declarations, publicly announcing opposition to the salary cut. Simultaneously, they petitioned the Chinese Seamen's Party Branch to negotiate with the Shipping Guild to cancel the proposed plan. As of now, no substantial outcome has been achieved. It is now learned that the Shipping Guild, due to misunderstandings arising from a notice previously issued by the Chinese Marine Engineers Association and other organizations, also published a notice yesterday to inform all sectors, putting forward eight reasons and explaining their unavoidable hardship in temporarily paying 80% of salaries. The original text of their notice is as follows: Shanghai Shipping Guild Public Announcement. Having read the notice published by the Chinese Marine Engineers United Federation, the Chinese Merchant Marine Captains Federation, and the Chinese Ship Wireless Operators Public Welfare Association opposing seamen's salary cuts, we find much of the wording to be misleading. Our guild originally did not want to waste time on unnecessary arguments, but fearing that the outside world would be misled by a lack of understanding of the true situation, we hereby disclose the true facts to society. This time, our guild, based on a resolution of a temporary general meeting, due to industry decline and internal cost-cutting, has provisionally decided to pay 80% of the salaries of seamen earning over 15 yuan per month starting from July 1st of this year. This will be implemented at the discretion of each company. In addition to notifying member private companies, we also sincerely sent letters to relevant organizations. This demonstrates our spirit of mutual assistance. We endured the pain and temporarily accommodated the situation in order to avoid suspending operations and suffering the consequences. This was truly out of unavoidable hardship. These organizations hastily published large-scale notices, accusing private shipping businesses of extreme disregard. Whether there are other motives is obvious to discerning individuals. We now refute several points they made as follows: (1) Although there are rental fees for supplying military charters, it is a proven fact whether they are more profitable than regular business during peacetime. We believe that the pain is due to foreign ships monopolizing passenger and cargo transport during emergency periods. When Chinese ships are required for minimal chartering, in comparison, they cannot match the reliable schedules of foreign ships, thus being affected. (2) After September 18th, 40 ships were added. If all domestic goods were shipped by Chinese ships, the existing ships would be far from sufficient. After September 18th, our private shipping businesses attempted to recover rights and interests and had to make some preparations. We could not have foreseen that our countrymen would fail to sympathize, leading to the current even more difficult situation. Moreover, 19 of the added ships were acquired through emotional appeals and mortgages. There are also records in the Shipping Administration Bureau that can be checked. It should be known that among these 40 ships, several thousand seamen were able to find employment. Shipping merchants are struggling to support this, allowing thousands of seamen to have a livelihood. The so-called booming situation is perhaps reasonably spoken of by outsiders who are unaware of the situation, but it is unexpected to hear it from the mouths of seamen, and it contains a tone of blame. (3) Ships have a mobile nature, so they need to add fuel everywhere. Ships traveling to Southeast Asia can add Keelung coal, but ships in Shanghai must purchase domestic coal. Although coal prices are slightly lower than before, compared to freight revenue, it is not as sufficient as when coal prices were higher in the past. Even taking the Tianjin-Shanghai route as an example, the freight rate for flour is only 16 cents per dan, and the freight rate for coal is only 1.5 yuan per ton. There is also factual evidence to prove this. (4) Regarding seamen's salaries, the current salaries of Japanese ship captains are all between 200 and 250 Japanese yen per month, and even lower-level seamen are no less cheap, and all expenses are in Japanese yen. In comparison, the cost is 30-40% lower than Chinese ships. Since we cannot prevent cargo from being loaded onto Japanese ships, how can we compete with them? If we simply wait for death, if the skin does not exist, what will the hair adhere to? (5) The companies' overdue salaries are not due to a lack of funds to pay them. Can't the seamen see and hear this? This shows that the relationship between owners and employees has always been harmonious, and it also proves the actual economic difficulties. (6) The statement that if salaries are reduced by 20%, why not also reduce freight rates by 20% and clearly seek private gain is even more ridiculous. If the freight rate discount is used as the standard for salary reduction, then I am afraid it will be less than 50%. May we ask if these organizations can use this as the standard? (7) The statement that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has seen its business improve since it was nationalized after being in debt of hundreds of thousands of yuan is incorrect. This company is the only state-owned shipping company, and its situation is naturally different from that of private companies. Regardless of its superior pier facilities, may we ask if any commercial enterprise can indefinitely ignore the principal and interest on its debts? Moreover, with the government as its backing and priority for postal and joint transport, it is also heard that the government has advanced over 5 million yuan in the past three years. If private companies had the same treatment, they would not be in this situation. (8) National shipping is a plan set by the Premier, and rewarding and protecting private shipping is a provision stipulated in the Provisional Constitution. The two are not contradictory. If they say that the fundamental solution is to completely nationalize, shipping merchants would be willing if there is a reasonable price. As for the issue of issuing shipping public bonds, it has already been approved on file. As for its method, we do not expect government subsidies, but only to clear mortgages and circulate funds to seek survival for private shipping. If shipping merchants can survive, seamen's livelihoods can be stabilized. Only those who are insane or have ulterior motives would oppose it. We believe that the remaining aggressive personal remarks are the opinions of a few individuals, seeking momentary gratification, gloating, and disregarding the overall situation. We do not bother to argue. We solemnly declare that if these organizations have other remarks in the future, we will not respond. We hereby publish this announcement for your fair judgment.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, told a *Xin Sheng News* reporter yesterday that the Relief Committee's disaster relief efforts last year were significantly aided by the Drought Relief Association. Regarding the implementation of all relief efforts, emergency relief has long been completed, and agricultural relief has also been completed. However, public works relief, such as water conservancy and road construction, cannot be completed immediately and still require a month. Recent ample rainfall has revived the provinces suffering from severe drought, which is deeply gratifying. However, I previously went to Beijing to meet with the Premier of the Executive Yuan and submitted a proposal to establish a Disaster Relief Fund Management Committee to prepare disaster relief funds for emergencies. It is also learned that Mr. Xu sent a telegram to the Premier yesterday, requesting the immediate appointment of a preparatory team to establish the committee as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e105">China National Products Maintenance Association Promotes Commercial Acceptance Drafts; Submits a Petition to Government Authorities Requesting Issuance of a Proclamation to Promote Them <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote commercial acceptance drafts to rescue domestic industry and commerce and stimulate social finance, the China National Products Maintenance Association, in addition to sending separate letters to member organizations and factories to encourage implementation, has also specifically submitted petitions to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting the issuance of a proclamation to inform everyone to implement them together. The petition requests the publication of a notice to encourage factories and merchants to implement commercial acceptance drafts in order to rescue domestic products. It is submitted for the purpose of the petition. Commercial acceptance drafts can indeed revitalize the market and increase capital. Their contribution to the survival and development of domestic industry and commerce is by no means superficial. Therefore, since the implementation of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Silk Industry Guild, and other organizations have initiated their creation and implementation, and more and more parties are responding and imitating them. Since commercial acceptance drafts can be circulated in the market once signed by the acceptor, turning stagnant accounts receivable into active finance, and can also be discounted to banks and pawnshops before maturity, its effect is equivalent to cash. Not only does it actually increase the capital share of the market by tens of thousands, it can also reduce disputes, increase the credit of both parties, and expand the sales of goods. It is truly a good and beautiful method of killing several birds with one stone. There is no better way to rescue industry and commerce than this. Our domestic manufacturers, at a time when financial tensions and economic downturns are increasing day by day, should resolutely implement it to enrich capital and consolidate the foundation. However, there are often ignorant merchants who adhere to old habits and are reluctant to reform, strongly opposing it, resulting in the failure to widely implement it. The domestic industry is deeply distressed. The association, in order to promote this system and rescue commercial difficulties, in addition to issuing orders to member factories to quickly handle commercial acceptance drafts in accordance with the law, submits this petition to your esteemed government departments for inspection and approval. Please issue a proclamation and publish a notice clarifying the advantages and absence of disadvantages of this system, and urge everyone to implement it together, in order to rescue and maintain industry and commerce. We are extremely anxious to await orders, and we also pray for instructions to comply with them as a virtue.</p>

<p>Since anti-Chinese riots occurred in Siam, the Chinese people have been very indignant. The Siamese authorities also know that such measures are detrimental to diplomatic relations and have expressed intentions to improve the treatment of overseas Chinese. Suddenly, there are rumors that Filipinos are excluding overseas Chinese engaged in retail and wholesale businesses. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited the local overseas Chinese affairs authorities to inquire. According to reports, they have not yet heard of this rumor and are currently paying attention to it. However, overseas Chinese in the Philippines have historically been on good terms with local people, and there have been no adverse sentiments. In recent years, overseas Chinese abroad have felt particularly difficult to live due to the impact of the global economic downturn. Some have automatically returned to China to seek a living. The government authorities are currently seeking methods of relief.</p>

According to the person in charge of the bureau, the report that the implementation will begin on July 1st is a misinterpretation from the outside world.

<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language *Nippon Daily News*, when Japanese businessman Matsubara Otozaburo of Matsubara &amp; Co. in the Shixing Li of Wuzhou Road on Upper Road recently returned to Japan, he forgot 10,000 yuan in cash in a car of the Shirotani Motor Company in Tanakamachi, Minato-ku, Osaka City. The car driver of the company then handed it over to the police station and published a notice for claims. The next day, Matsubara went to claim it and gave the driver 550 yuan as a thank you. However, the police station had various doubts about the 10,000 yuan in cash and summoned Matsubara to interrogate the origin of the 10,000 yuan. Matsubara claimed that he borrowed it from a friend. The police station then summoned some friends to confront him, and their statements were consistent. However, considering that Matsubara's mistress lived a very extravagant life, they also summoned the mistress. She confessed to the secret smuggling of cash, stating that from April of the previous year to May, a total of 200,000 yuan was secretly smuggled for export, and from June to January of this year, another 200,000 yuan was secretly smuggled. After the police station obtained the confession, they arrested the related parties on the 22nd and sent a judicial officer to Shanghai to surround Matsubara &amp; Co. on Wuzhou Road, arresting Matsubara's cousin, an employee of a certain company named Suzuki, and many other suspects.</p>

<p>The *Guanghua Medical Journal*, located at No. 9 Difeng Li, North Shaanxi Road, Shanghai, has been publishing a monthly magazine for two years. Due to its rich content and affordable price, its circulation is quite wide. The journal's editor-in-chief, Han Xukai, believes that medicine and pharmaceuticals are of utmost importance to the lives of the people. European and American countries pay special attention to them. China's medicine and pharmaceuticals have a history of thousands of years. Based on experiments and treatments, they do have their unique characteristics and value. Recently, there has been a division between Chinese and Western medicine. Not only has medicine and pharmaceuticals not progressed, but they have also fallen into a chaotic situation, which is truly heartbreaking. The journal believes that academics have no borders and that one should choose the good and follow it. Chinese and Western medicine each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It strives to eliminate prejudices, cooperate, and research with each other, and should take the entire field of medicine and pharmaceuticals as a prerequisite.</p>

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: Dear Sirs, regarding the telephone incident, please order the Shanghai Telephone Company to make corrections in accordance with the powers conferred by the taxpayers in order to protect the interests of taxpayer users. (1) Although the telephone fee has been changed from payment every three months to payment every month, the payment period should still be after monthly use. (2) Telephone fees should be calculated on a monthly basis. For example, from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, the company should calculate any fractions. Each machine should not collect an improper gain of five days per year. (3) The retroactive temporary surcharge for April and May should be calculated from the date of installation for telephones installed only in May or from April 2nd. Otherwise, it will be an extra-legal income. (4) To speak with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, it must not be transferred without the user's written notification and registration. There must also be a confirmed registration method to avoid unfair facts such as charging the wrong person, where some users do not pay and others who do not use the service are charged. (5) There are many errors in this telephone directory. In order to protect the legitimate interests of users, the company should reprint and distribute it according to the previous method of the China and Foreign Telephone Company.

<h3 id="e123">Radio Broadcasting Stations Broadcast Record Issues, International Phonograph Association Demands Fee Payment, Monthly Fee of One Hundred and Fifty Dollars Required <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to the Great American Evening Post, there are no less than sixty radio broadcasting stations in Shanghai. Besides broadcasting live singing and storytelling, they also play phonograph records. Various record companies have found that since broadcasting stations play their records, residents purchase fewer records, which greatly affects their business. Therefore, the International Phonograph Industrial Federation has commissioned Mr. Watson, the manager of the Shanghai Electrical Music Company, to write to various broadcasting stations, stating that from July 1st, anyone broadcasting records must pay a monthly fee of one hundred and fifty dollars, or legal action will be taken. It is said that recently the British court heard a similar lawsuit, and the plaintiff won. According to the current situation, most of the Shanghai broadcasting stations are run by Chinese and have limited capital and small scale, they would have no ability to pay this fee. Even the broadcasting stations run by foreigners, their current income is also small, it is feared that they will not be able to pay this huge fee every month.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Contemporary Literary Giant Zeng Mengpu Passes Away from Illness, Tired of Politics, He Retired to the Countryside, His Lifelong Writings Reached Over One Hundred Volumes <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Zeng Mengpu of Changshu, pen name "Sick Man of East Asia," father of Mr. Zeng Xubai, the chief editor of the Da Wan Bao, passed away from illness at his hometown on the afternoon of the twenty-third of this month. Mr. Zeng was learned and virtuous, a politician and a literary figure of his time. Now he has suddenly passed away, those who knew him and those who did not, all express their condolences. Here is a summary of his life facts:</p>
<p>Mr. Mengpu was sixty-five years old. During the late Qing Dynasty, he passed the Jinshi examination. In the early Republic, he successively served as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly, Secretary-General of the Jiangsu Provincial Governor's Office, Director of the Jiangsu Public Property Administration Office, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, Director of the Department of Administration, Acting Governor, and other positions. Later, administrative affairs became increasingly busy, which caused him to fall ill. Therefore, in 1925, he decided to abandon everything, recuperate in Shanghai, and engage in writing. During the Guangxu era, he initially founded the Xiaoshelin Bookstore. In 1926, he reopened the Zhenmei Bookstore, planning and managing it diligently. It was an expression of his lifelong dedication to literary pursuits. He wrote poetry, essays, notes, textual research, plays, novels, and other works, totaling over one hundred volumes, and was a giant in contemporary literary circles. The widely popular novels "A Flower in a Sea of Sin" and "The Man from Lu" are his carefully crafted masterpieces. In recent years, his physical strength declined, so he returned to his hometown to recuperate. At the foot of the mountain, he built a villa called "Xuzai Residence." He personally planted every flower and tree in the garden and devoted himself to the study of botany, gaining considerable insights. Recently, Mr. Zeng's illness suddenly worsened, and medical treatment was ineffective. On the afternoon of the twenty-third, amidst the bleak wind and rain, he passed away. All who heard the news could not help but feel grief and shed tears.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society, Content and Organization Updated, Municipal Council Chairman Arnold Returns to England <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The issue of reforming the Public Concession Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society once caused disputes last month. The Municipal Council, therefore, set up a special committee on rickshaws, to jointly study and handle the matter with the Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee. At the meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors, the special committee submitted a report stating that since its establishment, the society had held two meetings. The first was preliminary in nature, and the second discussed the organizational methods of the mutual aid fund management committee and the board of directors. According to the agreement in August last year, the organization of the Mutual Aid Society was for a trial period of eight months. Now that the term has expired, the rickshaw owners have been strenuously advocating for reorganization. According to the special committee's proposal, the organization of the management committee and the board of directors will be stipulated as follows: (1) The fund management committee will have three members, one from the Rickshaw Committee, one representative from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, who should be a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and one representative from the Chinese Ratepayers Association, who should be a respected banker in the city. (2) The board of directors will consist of three members of the Rickshaw Committee, two representatives of registered rickshaw owners, two representatives of registered rickshaw pullers (subject to the approval of the board of directors after the organization of their election body), one member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, one member of the Chinese Ratepayers Association, and four social workers. Previously, the fund management committee had three members, all of whom were members of the Rickshaw Committee. Now, one local impartial businessman and one banker will each serve as members to show fairness and impartiality. Furthermore, the original board of directors had twelve seats, with three members from the Rickshaw Committee, two representatives of rickshaw owners, and seven social workers. Although there was a provision for two seats for rickshaw pullers, no representatives were ever elected, which was tantamount to giving up their rights. Now, the number of social workers has been reduced to four, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers Association will each elect one person to participate, also to demonstrate the principle of impartiality. If the Board of Directors approves the special committee's proposal, the new members of the management committee must wait until the existing committee submits its accounts before they can take office. At the board of directors meeting, the proposed organizational rules for the fund management committee and the board of directors, suggested by the special committee, have been generally approved. However, regarding the social workers on the board of directors, it was decided to reduce the number from four to three. Furthermore, all rickshaw puller representative positions on the board of directors should be held by rickshaw pullers. Furthermore, Mr. Arnold, the chairman of the Municipal Council, left Shanghai today (the 25th) to return to England on official business and is expected to return around September 4th. During Mr. Arnold's vacation, the duties of the chairman will be temporarily assumed by the vice-chairman, Mr. Lamb.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Dispute Between Elementary School Principal and Female Teacher, They Lived Together and Had a Daughter, After Separation, Lawsuits Continued - The Case of Returning the Girl Was Finally Resolved <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Chen Ziying, a 23-year-old woman from Songjiang, was introduced to Jinghua Elementary School on Tangshan Road in 1933 by the brother of Wu Yao, the principal of the school, who was from Wuxian County, to work as a teacher. Therefore, she and Wu Yao spent time together day and night, and soon engaged in physical relations. They rented a house at 111 Fuzhi Road in the French Concession and lived together. At that time, Chen did not know that Wu was already married. When she learned that Wu had married Cao as his wife, their relationship broke down. As a result of negotiations, they announced their separation on October 10th. At that time, Chen was already several months pregnant, so the contract stipulated that in addition to Wu paying Chen three thousand dollars in alimony, regardless of whether Chen gave birth to a boy or a girl, Chen would have custody, and Wu would pay ten dollars per month for support until the child reached the age of sixteen. From then on, they went their separate ways. Later, Chen gave birth to a daughter named Xuerong on February 6th of this year. Because she did not have milk, she entrusted the child to Wu's sister, Wu Yueying. Recently, Chen filed a lawsuit against Wu Yao in the civil court of the First Special District Court for failing to fulfill the contract. The case had already been heard once and was rescheduled for the fourteenth of this month. Chen was beaten when she went to Wu's house to pick up Xuerong. She reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station and sued Wu for assault in the First Special District Court. After interrogation, Wu was fined fifteen yuan as a warning. Before one wave subsided, another rose. Chen Ziying is now suing Wu Yao, Wu Yueying, and Wu Cao for jointly abusing Xuerong maliciously, not feeding her milk, and causing her to become seriously ill. She believes that the reason for this is that they intend to cause the child's death to avoid paying the ten dollars per month in support. She considers it malicious abandonment and has retained lawyer Yang Zhenxiong to sue Wu Yueying, Wu Yao, and Wu Cao for abandonment in the criminal court of the First Special District Court, requesting that they be charged with the crime of abandonment, and as part of the civil lawsuit, she demands the return of Xuerong. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the third criminal court to summon the defendants. Wu Yueying did not appear due to illness. All others arrived on time. First, Chen Ziying stated the course of events. The judge then asked if her purpose was only to have Xuerong returned, and if Xuerong could be returned, whether she would withdraw the lawsuit. Chen said that if the child could be returned, she would withdraw the lawsuit. When questioned, Wu Yao agreed to return Xuerong to Chen, stating that the reason why he did not return the child immediately when the civil court opened was that the plaintiff had not acknowledged all the expenses for the child from February 6th to the present. Now he is willing to return the child immediately. Judge Jiang, seeing that the case had been settled, had both parties sign the document and ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>

<p>Shen Zhicai, a native of Shaoxing, previously married Chen Jingzhen, the daughter of Chen Jifa, a fellow villager. Shen was later imprisoned for six years for committing a crime. After his release from prison this spring, he discovered that his wife Chen Jingzhen had remarried to Du Azhang, an employee of the Dachangsheng Tobacco and Paper Shop. On May 3rd of this year, he personally saw Chen feeding a child in her arms in Wengjia Village, Cixi. When he questioned her, she claimed that her aunt, Liu Chen, had acted as matchmaker and married her to Du Azhang, and that the child was born to Du. She also claimed that Du had a divorce certificate from her and Shen Zhicai. Shen was greatly shocked to hear this, as he had not signed any document divorcing Chen. He then sued Du Azhang, Chen Jifa, and Liu Chen for forging documents in the criminal court of the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the court to summon the defendants. Du Azhang did not appear. Liu Chen was brought to court with assistance due to her suffering from mental illness. When questioned, Chen Jifa and Liu Chen both claimed that they were unaware of Chen Jingzhen's remarriage. Liu Chen also denied acting as matchmaker for her niece and claimed that she did not know who Du Azhang was. Chen Jingzhen then testified, stating that after her husband was imprisoned for two years, she could not bear the abuse from her in-laws, so she came to Shanghai to work as a servant to make a living. She denied having remarried or having a child. However, Shen Zhicai insisted that she and Du were married at the Gongping Restaurant in April or May of last year and that witness Shen Yongquan could testify. Judge Jiang stated that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<p>There is a river called DachiTou south of Min'an Road on North Baoxing Road, Zhabei, not far from Mingqiang Middle School. The river is rich in fish, so most of the residents nearby are fishing families and make a living by fishing. At dawn yesterday, eight or nine fishermen from the area went to the DachiTou River to set nets and fish, preparing to sell their catch in the vegetable market. Not long after setting the nets, the fishermen felt that the bottom of the net was unusually heavy. They all thought that a huge fish had been caught in the net and were overjoyed. They hurriedly pulled up the net, but upon closer inspection, their faces turned pale. What was in the net was not a fish, but a corpse. The fishermen were immediately panicked and did not know what to do. Fortunately, an elder was slightly more composed and immediately ran to report to the nearby Baziqiao Branch. The patrol officer of the branch led a senior police officer to investigate. Indeed, it was a male corpse, with a lifelike face, about twenty years old, wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, barefoot and bald, with his mouth and eyes not closed. Several knife wounds were found on his body. Having been in the water for too long, it had already started to decompose, and the abdomen was bulging like a giant stone. After questioning the neighbors, no one recognized the body. It was thought that he was killed and thrown into the river. The patrol officer then reported to the Baoshan Road Branch, and the district chief Fu Chu went to investigate in person, ordering the local security officer to report to the local court that afternoon to request an autopsy and also report to the bureau to investigate the case and search for relatives to claim the body.</p>

<p>Jiang Yizheng, also known as Wang Dabao, a native of Danyang, is thirty years old this year. He repeatedly committed kidnapping and murder cases in the countryside under the jurisdiction of Wujin County, Changzhou. After the case, he fled to Shanghai and hid in the Shunxingyuan teahouse at No. 284 Pingjili Road in the French Concession, making a living by selling old goods. After receiving a report from an informant from the Wujin County Court Procuratorate, he prepared a document and requested the assistance of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai in arresting him. The president of the Second Special District Court, Wang, immediately issued an arrest warrant and sent it to the French police. On the 21st, they sent detectives to the address to arrest Jiang and brought him back to the police station. On the same day, he was transferred to the Second Special District Court. After the judge Zhang Chaozuo questioned him in court, he ordered him to be detained pending notification from the Wujin Court to come and pick him up. It is now learned that the Wujin Court sent bailiff Chen Minzhou to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he submitted a request to the Second Special District Court for transfer. Judge Zhang opened the court, ordered the Jiang to be brought, asked about his age and origin, and then ruled that Jiang Daozheng, also known as Wang Dabao, was allowed to be handed over to the Wujin Court police to take him back to Changzhou to be tried according to law.

<p>Wang Shichen, a native of Qingjiang, is currently serving as a Sihu patrol officer with number 1268 and is assigned to serve in a certain alley on Hankou Road. However, he has recently become associated with bandits and relies on the weapons he has been given to be unlawful. He recently sent a threatening letter to a wealthy household on Tongfu Road, extorting two hundred yuan. The victim did not want to pursue the matter, so the case was never reported. However, Wang became even bolder and agreed with his accomplices to meet at Room 39 of the Songjiang Inn on Fuzhou Road at 11 PM the night before to plot a robbery. Shen Dehui, a detective of the Huishi Police Station, learned of the plan in advance and quickly reported it to the patrol captain. He rushed to the scene with the Western Detective Chief and three Chinese detectives to arrest them. They entered the room and found Wang and two accomplices inside, plotting. Seeing that the situation was bad, they got up one after another to try to escape. Because there were detectives blocking the door, it was difficult to break through. One bandit jumped out of the window and fled. Shen and the other detectives saw that Wang still wanted to resist arrest, so they fired a shot into the air to warn him. Wang and his accomplice, Chen Xinxiang from Ningbo, were then subdued and arrested. The detectives then searched the room and found Wang Shichen's uniform, a White Browning pistol, five bullets, and one bullet casing. As for the bandit who jumped out of the window, he was nowhere to be seen. However, the window was quite high off the ground, and jumping down would definitely cause injury. It was expected that he would have fled with injuries. In addition to continuing to strictly pursue the arrest, Wang and Chen were arrested and, along with Wang's uniform and weapons, were escorted to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Yang Zhaoqi interrogated them. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the circumstances of the case. As the crimes committed by the two people needed to be investigated in detail, he requested that they be detained pending further investigation and prosecution according to the law. The court approved the request and ordered that they be detained for seven more days of questioning.</p>

<p>The China Animal Protection Society recently sent a letter to the Hangzhou Municipal Government yesterday regarding the fact that beggars in Hangzhou were catching non-venomous green snakes to make a living, requesting them to order the Public Security Bureau to investigate and prohibit them at any time in order to stop the cruel practices. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Beggars in Hangzhou Catch Snakes to Make a Profit</p>
<p>Philanthropist Zhu Yinjiang wrote to the society, saying that he wanted to address the fact that beggars in Hangzhou were catching green snakes to make a profit. He said, "I was in Hangzhou before and saw many snake-playing beggars who specialize in catching non-venomous green snakes and selling them along the road in front of temples, persuading people to buy and release them, calling it a good deed, but it is actually a scam. After people buy and release them, the next day they catch the released snakes again and sell them again, catching and releasing them repeatedly to make a profit. Those who sincerely release animals are causing these innocent animals to suffer more pain, not being able to live or die. The cruelty is beyond words. I have always admired your society for protecting animals and sparing no effort. Can you send a letter to the local Public Security Bureau ordering the police to prohibit beggars from catching snakes? It is appropriate to ask your society to ask the philanthropists to discuss in detail to stop this practice, which would be a great benefit."</p>
<p>Letter to the Hangzhou Municipal Government Ordering Investigation and Prohibition</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the society, represented by Chairman Ye Gongchuo and Vice Chairman Guan Jiongzhi, sent a letter to the Hangzhou Municipal Government yesterday, saying: "We are writing to you because Mr. Zhu Yinjiang, a member of our society, wrote to us, saying that in Hangzhou, he saw snake-playing beggars who specialize in catching non-venomous green snakes and selling them along the road in front of temples, persuading people to buy and release them. After people buy snakes and release them, these beggars catch them again and sell them again, calling it a good deed, but it is actually a scam, and it causes innocent animals to suffer repeatedly. He asked us to forward a letter requesting investigation and prohibition. The act of beggars playing with snakes to beg for sale is extremely cruel and easily leads to cruel practices. We are sending you this letter to request that you order the Public Security Bureau to investigate and prohibit them at any time in order to eliminate fraud and cruel practices. We look forward to hearing from you."</p>

During the trial, Yan confessed that Li Guocheng, also known as Chen You, instigated him, assembling Jiu Cheng (九成), Liu Wu (劉五), Zhang San (張三), and others who were at large to go and commit the murders. Subsequently, based on information from Yan's family, Li was apprehended in the Rihui Port area of Shanghai South and sent to the Public Security Bureau. A request was made to the First Special District Court to bring him to trial. The court ordered the police to investigate and prosecute. After the trial concluded, Li Guocheng was also sentenced to death. Immediately the criminal was sentenced to death according to law. Li refused to accept the original verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Li still refused to accept the verdict and filed a third appeal with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, after reviewing the entire case file, noted that when Jiang Zhonghan, a victim, was questioned at Renji Hospital after Yan was apprehended, he stated that he only recognized three of the perpetrators and that Li Guocheng was only implicated by Yan's confession. There was no concrete evidence to prove whether Li actually went to commit the murders, so further investigation was deemed necessary. Therefore, the Supreme Court decided to overturn the original verdict and return the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for a new trial. The Second Branch of the High Court received the returned case file, and the presiding judge, Guo Dezhang, together with assessors Xiong and Zhu, and prosecutor Zhang, held a re-trial the day before yesterday. Li Guocheng's defense lawyer, Zhang Shijie, and others were also present in court awaiting instructions. Qian Yumin, the detective from the French police who handled the case, was also summoned to the court to be questioned. The court first questioned the appellant, Li Guocheng, who continued to deny participating in the murders, claiming that Yan Jinbiao was holding a grudge and falsely implicated him. He requested that the truth be revealed. Then, Detective Qian Yumin testified about the circumstances under which he apprehended Yan and the victims' identification of the perpetrators at Renji Hospital. Later, the court determined that a key witness in the case, Wang Jiemei, the manager of the Fa Shang Hotel, had not been summoned to court. Therefore, the court adjourned the trial and decided to summon the witness to court for further questioning at a later date, and then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e137">### Wang Yangshan Accused of Disrupting Family: Taking a Chang Sister as a Concubine; Older Sister Files Suit After Her Uncle's Accusation <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yangshan, a native of Zhenjiang and assistant manager of the Chengzihhao branch of the Huianli business located at the intersection of Hankou Road and Fujian Road, is 45 years old. Previously, because his wife had been unable to bear children for a long time, for continuation, he took a Chang woman from his hometown as a concubine in the fifteenth year. She soon gave birth to a daughter, who is now eight years old. Last year, the concubine's father died in their hometown. The concubine, feeling that her three brothers were useless and fearing that her younger sister, Chang Rongzhen, would have difficulty making a living in their hometown, brought her to Shanghai to live with her. At that time, Rongzhen was only seventeen or eighteen years old. Although she was a country girl, she was quite beautiful. Wang Yangshan took a special liking to her and treated her extraordinarily well. By the end of January last year, Wang, using the excuse that neither his wife nor concubine had given birth to a son, expressed his unresolved anxieties and wished to take another concubine in the hope of fulfilling his long-cherished desire. The concubine had long suspected Wang's intentions and felt that Rongzhen was also suitable to bear a son. Therefore, imitating the story of the sisters Ehuang and Nüying, they both served Wang together. From then on, Wang enjoyed the pleasures of being surrounded by beautiful women. Unexpectedly, the concubine, after offering her sister to Wang, suddenly resented that Wang's favor was not evenly distributed and that she was not treated equally. Consequently, her attitude also changed, and she gradually became romantic and engaged in illicit behavior with other men. Because the matter was not kept secret, Wang eventually discovered it. Wang took decisive action and drew up an agreement to permanently sever their relationship. The concubine's younger brother, Chang Rongpei, who had been living and eating at Wang's house as the concubine's brother, left with his sister even though his younger sister remained because he did not get along with the younger sister. Currently, Chang Rongpei has hired a lawyer to sue Wang Yangshan in the First Special District Court for disrupting the family and other charges, requesting that Wang be punished in accordance with Article 257 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened the court to hear the case. First, the plaintiff, Chang Rongpei, stated the circumstances under which the defendant, Wang Yangshan, and his sisters separated, saying that Wang harmed his sister and also committed adultery with his younger sister, and denied that his sister and Wang were concubines, and that he had agreed. Next, Wang Yangshan stated that taking Rongzhen as a concubine was entirely advocated by her sister, and that he had even hosted a banquet at the time. Chang Rongzhen also surrendered to the court, saying that she lived with Wang on the orders of her sister, and that the plaintiff knew everything beforehand. Finally, the witnesses invited by the defendant testified that Wang hosted a banquet when he took a concubine, and that they were invited guests. Judge Feng then adjourned the hearing until the morning of the 29th of this month for further questioning.</p>

<p>There was originally a ferryboat at Dongjiadu in the southern section of the Huangpu River, carrying passengers back and forth between the west bank of Puxi and the east bank of Pudong. The captain of the ferryboat was Yang Jinsong. Yesterday morning at 6:30 AM, the ferryboat was carrying more than twenty passengers from Puxi to Pudong when a small steamer from the Qiuxin Factory, traveling north from the south, approached midstream. Due to the recent mooring of many dredgers in the area, it approached the ferryboat too closely, and it was too late to avoid a collision. The steamer collided with the ferryboat, and the ferryboat was shaken. Three villagers were shaken and fell into the Huangpu River. The steamer immediately stopped and began searching. One person was rescued on the spot, but the other two were missing. It was reported that the missing villagers were selling pickled vegetables, and their names were not yet known.</p>
<p>Additional news: The passengers who fell into the river were Tang Shutao and He Mulin. Afterwards, Qian, the wife of the deceased Tang Shutao, and Sheng, the mother of He Mulin, went to the Tangqiao police station in Pudong to request an investigation. According to Qian, her husband was 31 years old and lived in Tangjiazhai in Pudong. This morning, he went to Puxi to purchase funeral supplies for a relative, but unfortunately, he met with disaster on his way home. Her grief was overwhelming. According to Sheng, her son was 28 years old, a local resident living in Hejiazhai in Pudong. He went to Puxi this morning to buy pickled vegetables and was tragically knocked into the river and drowned. She requested justice. Sheng is already 60 years old and was sobbing uncontrollably as she spoke, her old tears streaming down her face. The director of the Dongjiadu station ordered that Yang A-Da, the ferryboat crew member responsible for the accident, be brought to the station for a brief interrogation before being sent to the general office for disposal. Yang Zhufa, another crew member, was summoned by the water patrol team for interrogation. As of last night, the bodies of the deceased had not yet been recovered.</p>

<p>At 8:30 yesterday morning, four robbers broke into the home of Yao Jiangtian, a local resident who manages rentals at No. 3 Yangyinli, Dongbaiyang Lane, Zhonghua Road, Dananmen, Nanshi (a single-story stone gate house). A water company bill collector, Chen, went to Yao's house to collect the water bill. Yao invited Chen inside and asked him to wait in the parlor while Yao went upstairs to the writing room on the upper floor to write a bank check. Suddenly, they heard a knock on the door. Yao's widowed sister-in-law opened the door, and four robbers rushed in. They first approached Chen and asked if he was Mr. Yao. Chen replied that Mr. Yao was upstairs. Upon hearing this, the robbers showed their guns and ordered them to be silent. They then began their robbery, with one robber guarding the front door and another searching Chen's wallet. Two other robbers went upstairs and saw Yao Jiangquan writing a check. They threatened him with their guns, saying, "Please help us out." They then opened the wallet on the desk and took more than a hundred yuan in cash. Still not satisfied, they turned and went to the front building. Yao's wife heard the sound of the robbery and remained silent in fear, allowing the robbers to ransack the cabinets. In total, they stole more than 800 yuan in cash and a gold ring from Yao's wife's finger (weighing six qian). After obtaining the loot, the robbers forced Yao and his wife downstairs and into the back of the parlor, ordering them to stand facing the wall, not to look back, and not to cross the line. The robbers then rushed out the door and fled. Afterwards, Yao Jiangtian and Chen reported the incident to the local police station and requested an investigation. Jin Dianyang, the station chief, immediately ordered the officers to search the area, but the robbers had already disappeared. The four robbers were well-dressed. One wore a blue silk gauze long gown, was about 30 years old, and wore a straw hat. Another wore a dark Indian silk long gown and a felt hat, and was about 30 years old. One wore a gray Indian silk long gown, was bald, and had no hat, and was about 40 years old. One wore a white silk short shirt and pants, and was about 20 years old. They all spoke with a local accent and carried guns. Yao Jiangtian's family is not wealthy, and the stolen money was rent collected on behalf of others. He is now lamenting the loss of the large sum of money.</p>

<p>Shanghai citizens advocate for national goods. According to a report from the factory member, Lihua Weaving Factory, to ensure the tax amount of its products, it went to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau to register. However, a trademark with the same name had already been registered, which infringed upon the right of the Ministry of Industry to register its trademark. It requested assistance. Yesterday, the Executive Committee decided to issue a letter of proof, along with various registration licenses, requesting approval of the registration to protect its legal rights. The letter is recorded below: "To whom it may concern, our factory member, Lihua Weaving Factory, has reported that its products, such as undershirts, require the use of unified tax forms. The factory sent personnel to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau to declare and register. It was informed that a trademark with the same name had already been approved, and the requested registration was not permitted. Our member's trademark was approved by the Ministry of Industry on August 9th, 1932 and is duly registered. Therefore, we are writing to your association to forward this letter to the bureau, requesting that the registration be approved."

<p>Committee members Xu Duo, Hu Jiankun, Lu Zhongqiu, Lu Xiulu, and Chen Linsheng of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, because the Sixth National Games are about to be held in Shanghai, table tennis comrades heard this news and came to the association one after another to request sending a letter to the National Games to add table tennis championships. Mr. Xu and others believe that this matter is of great importance to the future of table tennis and went to Wang Bohong, Wang Mengnian, Zhang Yongren, Yang Xiqing and other gentlemen to seek opinions, and invited Wang Yi and others from the Chinese Table Tennis Research Association to participate in serious discussions. After several consultations, the draft was finally completed. It is heard that in addition to the letter, the association also plans to push Xu Duo, Yu Binqi, Lu Zhongqiu, Hu Jiankun, and Chen Linsheng to take charge of the process and strive to achieve the goal. The full letter is recorded below, hoping that table tennis comrades from all over the country will rise up and strive for it together.</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, we rely on your efforts to organize this National Games. Your talents and plans are thorough and meticulous. Our association is deeply grateful for the future of the sports world. Now, there is a suggestion that table tennis has a long history and special functions. After several improvements, it has become a scientific sport. It is very developed in various countries and we should catch up quickly in our country. As far as our association can see, we believe that this National Games should officially include table tennis in the championship competition to promote it. We dare to offer our opinions, hoping that you will consider them and adopt them. (1) The progress of sports technology depends entirely on social promotion, and public awards are especially important. This can be seen from the past. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has made every effort to advocate national sports, and as a result, all sports have made great progress. If the government had seen this earlier and taken the lead, the results would be even better and would be able to compete with the world. Table tennis is a modern sport. Governments of various countries have promoted it vigorously. International competitions are held regularly. Our country lags behind in everything. After nearly 20 years of efforts by our association, we are fortunate to have achieved some results. If we can get your advocacy in this National Games and set up championships and include them in the competition, then there will be widespread response, and the results can be expected. In the future, we will also be able to cope with international competitions with ease. This is the first reason why table tennis should be included in the National Games Championship.</p>
<p>(2) Chairman Chiang issued a winter telegram to the whole country to exercise the national physique and transform the sound nation, requiring everyone to choose a sport and practice it regularly every day, even in wind, rain, ice and snow. The law is good and the meaning is beautiful. All nationals should abide by it. And to seek a sport, which is beneficial to individuals in terms of motivation, time, and place, and can achieve results soon, only table tennis is the easiest to practice, and it is the most consistent with the spirit of Chairman Chiang's perseverance in wind, rain, ice and snow. This is the second reason why table tennis should be included in the National Games Championship.</p>
<p>(3) It is said that this National Games has rumors of including shuttlecock and other games in the competition. If this is the case, table tennis, as a world-recognized scientific sport technology, should not be absent. This is the third reason why table tennis should be included in the National Games.</p>
<p>(4) Table tennis competitions have been included in the Far East Games as a performance, and there have been proposals to set up championships. The world table tennis competition is also very fierce. If we do not prepare early and train a strong army, it will be difficult to win once we join the competition. Today, we should prepare early so that we can be sharp when the time comes. This is the fourth reason why table tennis should be included in the National Games Championship. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— (Bo Guang)</p>
<p>Modern young students, carrying the banner of studying as a guise, go to dance halls, watch movies, and talk about love every day, spending their parents' hard-earned money without any regret. After a few years, they get a diploma, deceiving their parents, deceiving themselves, deceiving their conscience—the black language in the academy, those who graduate from domestic universities are called "silver-plated"; those who go abroad to study are called "gold-plated"—but there are also those who study hard, but they are always a minority.</p>
<p>The call for promoting domestic products is deafening, but according to the customs report, there is still an excess of imported goods, which shows that the psychology of Chinese people worshiping foreign goods is too firm. A certain person produces a kind of exquisite cosmetics, and tries hard to promote it, but it is still unsalable. Later, he modified it to imitate foreign products, and it was deeply loved by modern women, and it spread like wildfire. A certain person called it "gold-plated," meaning that modern women only know how to follow blindly and do not distinguish between the quality of goods, which can be said to be a joke and abuse.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Philosophy of Smoking Cigarettes <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Banana Heart</p>
<p>There are two people, A and B, who both have two kinds of cigarettes, one good and one bad. A offers the good ones to guests and keeps the bad ones for himself to smoke; B does the opposite, offering the bad ones to guests and keeping the good ones for himself to smoke. I was puzzled, so I went to ask A, and his answer was:</p>
<p>"Offering bad ones to guests is too shabby, and it will inevitably be laughed at; although it is hard for myself to eat bad ones, I will never be laughed at for being shabby, so I would rather offer good ones to guests and eat bad ones myself."</p>
<p>I also went to ask B, and B's reason was also very sufficient:</p>
<p>"Offering cigarettes to guests is a very common thing. If you offer good ones to guests, people may not necessarily thank you, so it is better to enjoy the good ones yourself."</p>
<p>I felt that the words of A and B both had their reasons. Later, I met Mr. C, who also had two kinds of cigarettes, but he did not necessarily offer that kind to guests, but differed according to the guest. I went to ask him what the reason was, and he said:</p>
<p>"I offer good cigarettes to those whose status is higher than mine, and I am not polite to those who are not as good as me and offer bad cigarettes; as for myself, I smoke good ones when I have more money, and I smoke bad ones when I have less money."</p>
<p>After listening to Mr. C's words, and comparing the words of A and B with each other, Mr. C's method is much more astute.</p>
<p>Smoking cigarettes is originally a small matter, but I didn't expect it to contain a very deep philosophy of life!</p>
<h3 id="e188">Idle Things <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>This happened twenty years ago, just an idle thing. I was lying ill in the Ministry of Works Hospital, with a severe sore throat, fearing only death. I had no other awareness. As I gradually recovered, I was moved by a nursing girl. At that time, I was a child, only twelve years old. The girl's face and features were all [missing], I knew her to be beautiful. Her petite figure, light steps, and especially her white and clean appearance reflected in plain clothes, made people feel refreshed. I can still see it all in front of me! During her service to my illness, she was as gentle and pleasant as I wished. As we got to know each other, a few words would make me smile. I was especially impressed by her frequent visits. She called me [missing], asked about my family background, and said that she should be a matchmaker for me and find me a good wife. These were probably unintentional words, but how could I not imagine them? She spoke English wonderfully with the Western women in the hospital, like an oriole singing from a valley or a pearl rolling on a plate. I could only understand a word or two, but I was completely captivated! This [missing] girl, I think was just seventeen years old, seemed to gather the beauty of all the virgins under heaven in one body. I often thought to myself, if I could get a wife like this, what more could a husband ask for? My nephew came to visit me and asked about her illness. He praised her beauty and wisdom, and also said that she was enough to be a partner for my beloved younger brother. I silently acknowledged that he felt the same way. The girl's heart could not be guessed. I pitied my small self, insignificant and unworthy, an unequal match. In the end, I entrusted a letter [missing]—"Since the beauty left with tears, the rivers and mountains have been the ends of the earth forever. In this time when the sea and sky are yellow, I miss that beauty from afar, and can't help but feel a sense of delay?"</p>
<p>As I grew older, I dazzled the world with my writing, and I devoted myself to my interests, and I did not seek perfection. When my works were widely published, someone would send fresh flowers to my residence every other day, always with a small name card attached, on which the maiden name could be identified, but they soon stopped. After several months, the flowers came as before, and after another half a year, they stopped completely. Later, I accidentally learned that the person who sent the flowers was an old woman from a wealthy family. A letter of correction was found in the pile of old papers in my newly rented room. The writing was superficial, but the recipient was clearly my name. What did she give me? The intention of sending flowers with a heartfelt intention was to encourage me. From beginning to end, I felt that I was lacking in many ways, so I kept it to myself.</p>
<p>This is what my friend Feng Xisheng said, is it a self-description? He is now a famous writer, good at conceiving and creating novels, so it is his novel data, I don't know, I will record it for now.</p>

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I ran into an old man at Zhang's wedding banquet. He was nearly seventy years old. There were also two young men at the banquet, dressed in Western-style clothes, who were talking a lot about the Shanghai Opera tunes on their radios, which one was good and which one was bad. It really felt like they were enjoying it. The old man listened silently, holding up his wine glass and drinking non-stop. He held his chopsticks in one hand and ate with his mouth open, like raindrops. Later, the two young men also finished talking. Someone asked the old man, "Old man, do you like to listen to the radio?" The old man twirled his snow-white beard, smiled kindly, and replied, "There are several kinds of sounds that I don't like to listen to, but if I say it, I'm afraid I'll offend everyone!"</p>
<p>The two young men saw that he was old-fashioned and intentionally asked the old man to say it. The old man had to be impolite and said, "Alas, I'm old, not only do I not understand the radio, I don't like to listen to it. Even the most wonderful music and songs annoy me. This is my characteristic. Moreover, not only do I not like to listen to it, but I also hate listening to it very much. What are some kinds of sounds? Like the crackling sound of playing cards in the middle of the night, the sound of neighbors quarreling, and the sound of snoring when someone is still sleeping in bed when it is lunchtime. When I hear these sounds, I really want to teach them a lesson and blame them. What is the reason? Because these sounds violate the principles of life in front of us." After speaking, he pointed to the blue and white porcelain badges hanging on the two young men's clothes and asked, "What are these things?" It turned out to be the logo of implementing a new life. The two young men blushed, revealing some shame, and were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>After a while, one of the young men asked the old man angrily, "Then, old man, are there any sounds you like to listen to?" The old man said, "Yes, at home, I like to listen to my old wife opening the oil pan in the kitchen the most. It's like an eight-tone piano. Or when she puts the vegetables in the pot, it makes a crisp sound, like a thunderbolt. Isn't this an extremely good sound? Next to the river, there are several young women, using a wooden stick to pound clothes constantly. The sound of patting resonates on both sides of the river, and sometimes it wakes people up from their sweet dreams in the early morning. This kind of sound is really never tired of listening to!" When the two young men heard the old man say this, they knew that he was satirizing them, and they couldn't help but feel respectful. They bowed their hands and said, "Old man, your words are really good. After listening to these words, I can't help but remember them and present them to the readers."</p>

<p>Chapter Fifteen: Earnest Advice and Resentment Don't Come From Nowhere, Qian Xin's Lantern Shadow is Pitifully Being Sold</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhiqian's blunt exposure left him speechless and blushing, head lowered. Zhiqian said, "Human compassion is something that everyone has. Your righteous indignation just now wasn't inherently wrong. However, you didn't think it through. " Beihai was even more at a loss for words. Seeing an old newspaper on the table, he casually picked it up and held it up to read. Zhiqian sat in silence for a moment, then laughed, "Actually, there's no need to worry too much. Their deal definitely won't go through. " Beihai asked, "What's the reason for that?" Zhiqian said, "They, three generations of them – two widows and a girl – escaped from Gansu to this place. They've already made it this far. How could they possibly separate and sell family members in a place where they can beg for food?" Beihai said, "I think so too. But if this deal doesn't go through, that Hu Xiaoming family won't keep them living there anymore. Where will they go to settle down then?" As he said this, he was genuinely worried for them. He put down the newspaper, put his hands behind his back, and paced back and forth in the room. Zhiqian didn't stop him, letting him worry as he pleased. While he was pacing, he caught sight of Yang Huanhua hurrying past the window. It was clear that she had already gotten a result at the Hu Xiaoming's house and was going to report to Jia Duocai. So, this matter was a success. He suddenly turned around, ready to walk out the door. But at the same time, he saw Zhiqian smiling slightly at the side, and he immediately suppressed his impulse to rush out. Zhiqian smiled, "That Miss Yang just passed by the window. You could go ask Zhong and inquire about some news. " Zhiqian's bluntness made him blush even more, looking embarrassed. He forced a smile and said, "Their affairs aren't worth my attention."

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After she finished speaking that passage, I couldn't help but feel secretly doubtful again, wondering if the Empress Dowager herself truly believed in the so-called "mischievous creator": but I dared not ask her rashly, because I still remembered the reprimand I received in Fengtian for the Green Fox Immortal incident. But the Empress Dowager's eyesight was truly sharp, and she had already seen the doubts lurking in my heart, so without waiting for me to ask, she added another explanation for me.</p>
<p>"We certainly cannot guarantee that there truly is such a deity in the world, we can only say that perhaps there is; but there are many such divine beings that we cannot see with our own eyes, and their existence is often undeniable to us. You might as well try to think about it: in your past experiences, have you ever had the experience of everything going extremely smoothly, especially, and then suddenly various unexpected problems arise, making you feel extremely frustrated; I think this is absolutely unavoidable! And the one who frustrates you in the dark is the so-called 'mischievous creator'!"</p>
<p>As soon as she said this, I knew that she herself had at least half a belief in this mischievous creator who was neither an immortal nor a Buddha. I couldn't help but feel very happy, deeply pleased that I had not dared to make reckless criticisms just now, otherwise I would have suffered another scolding. Because the old woman had this kind of belief in her heart, it made her feel uneasy all the time: for example, after she had played a little more happily today, she was worried that something unfortunate would happen, or even had the fear that if it didn't happen today, it would definitely happen tomorrow.

<h3 id="e193">Japanese Chinese Cuisine <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Japan are mostly in Yokohama and Tokyo. They either open grocery stores or Chinese restaurants and tea houses. Other businesses are difficult to compete with the Japanese, so they are rarely seen. The Japanese call cuisine "ryori," and Chinese restaurants are called "Chuka ryori" (Chinese cuisine). These overseas Chinese are mostly from Beijing, Shandong, Ningbo, Guangdong, and other places, especially Ningbo. In various districts of Tokyo, there is nowhere without their businesses. Even though they are all Chinese cuisines, the seasoning methods are also different. Northern restaurants mostly sell steamed buns and mantou. The seasoning also removes the spicy smell of scallions and garlic. Southern restaurants emphasize assorted dishes. Chinese noodles and shumai are famous.</p>
<p>Japanese people who have eaten Chinese cuisine have no choice but to praise the excellence of the Chinese people's seasoning methods. Even laborers who eat bento (lunch boxes) every day often ask friends to try Chinese noodles once. Chinese and Japanese newspapers and magazines also often have seasoning guides for Chinese cuisine. However, most of them are seasoning methods for Chinese restaurants, which are not suitable for home cooking, and not many Japanese people are trying to imitate them. The so-called Chinese noodles are just ordinary Chinese soup noodles. On top are a few slices of meat as thin as ham and a few Taiwan bamboo shoots. The price is about ten cents, and the profit is not small. Shumai are different from those in our country. They are balls made of minced meat and cabbage, wrapped in flour and made into a round shape. Because there is very little minced meat, the cost is light, so four or five can be bought for ten cents.</p>
<p>Japanese people have learned the rudiments of our country's seasoning methods and are also competing with the stores, hanging up Chinese cuisine signs. Moreover, there is also a Shaoxing wine jar at the door, with colorful pictures on it, indicating a sign that they can't cook Chinese dishes. These empty wine jars are sold in secondhand stores for as much as one yuan and eighty cents each. Chinese restaurants all sell wine imported from China, such as Wujiapi, Shaoxing wine, and yellow wine. Each jar has customs duties of four or five yuan or more, so the price is very expensive. Moreover, the taste of the wine is stronger than Japanese wine, so not many people come to try it. In addition, there are pumpkin seeds, watermelon seeds, large green plums, and preserved eggs on display in the display cabinet, plus tin-made hot pots and longevity candle stands. Who would think that they are living in a foreign country?</p>
<p>In the Kanda district, where there are the most foreign students, Chinese food sells even more. The store is full of Chinese students, and some people can't find a seat and leave. Because of different provinces and dialects, Chinese people can only speak to each other in Japanese, which is what we feel is the most difficult thing. But the Japanese language is not unified either. People from Tokyo and Nagasaki need an interpreter to talk to each other.</p>
<p>Foreign students have a special kind of packed lunch called "teishoku" (set meal), which costs about twenty cents per meal. Although the dish and soup are simple, they are much better than the raw and cold Japanese dishes. Not being able to eat large pieces of meat in Japan is a serious problem. Japanese people like to eat vegetables and fish, so there are not many butcher shops and the prices are also very expensive. I heard that Japanese people slaughter pigs in an unconventional way: they beat the pigs to death with sticks, and then skin them, like killing cows. So there is indeed no skin on the pork. Also, the kidneys and feet, which are considered precious in our country, are not eaten by them. So Chinese restaurants have a lot of cheap goods. Four pig's feet can be obtained for ten cents, so the twenty-cent set meal can also include one pig's foot.</p>
<p>A full course of dishes costs about eight yuan to more or less. Apart from Chinese banquets, Japanese people don't often ask people to eat them. One reason is that the price is too expensive, and the second is that Japanese people eat separately. Many people sitting around eating together is not customary.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the last day of the June futures trading at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. Based on the trend of the past weekend, there would not have been a drastic squeeze. This was because the long and short positions had mostly been adjusted. Unexpectedly, a large batch of sales suddenly appeared at No. 4 yesterday. This special change was beyond the expectations of the general public. Due to the loose and excessive amount of chips, the market brewed a tragic short squeeze, which was fierce and intense. As a result, the 20-mark bonds were squeezed up by more than two yuan. The Cut-Troops and Reorganization bonds fell by more than one and a half yuan, and the rest all fell by about one yuan. Only the situation of the 96 Public Bonds was stable, and the result was flat. Starting today, only one month of July will be traded, and June will be delivered on the 27th. Due to the distribution of chips, the trend and future of the market will be difficult to recover in a short period of time. As for yesterday's events, the market opened in the morning, and the No. 8 bonds took the lead in the short squeeze. Afterwards, due to the acquisition by retail investors, the situation eased. The market price of the Cut-Troops bonds even rose. The situation suddenly changed from the 19-mark bonds onwards. The No. 4 and No. 77 bonds were heavily sold. This temporary change gave people a great threat. The decline suddenly rose, and the market price unanimously fell by several angles to about one yuan. Among them, the No. 69 bonds sold a huge amount of unified tax bonds, reaching one million, which is also worth noting. In the second session, the selling of No. 4 bonds was still strong. The Cut-Troops bonds were short squeezed, and they fell sharply by one yuan and one angle. Afterwards, each bond was short squeezed. The short-term gold No. 22 bonds slightly improved. The No. 23 and No. 4 bonds were sold the most. It was reported that it was the goods of the Savings Association. The front row was slightly calmer before the opening of the afternoon market, but the back row started another short squeeze. The waves at the close were even more turbulent. The short squeeze of the Cut-Troops bonds fell another seven or seven angles. Afterwards, all bonds were short squeezed. The market price of short-term gold bonds was even more chaotic. Due to the competition and pressing up of No. 11 and No. 43, a plate of listings reached 30 yuan, showing the fierceness of the competition. Since then, the No. 23 bonds have fallen sharply by another eight angles, but the No. 96 bonds have stood out and rose by an angle. In total, the total transaction volume for the day was more than 50 million yuan. The high and low results are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e198">Yarn and Cotton The Price of Standard Yarn and Cotton Initially Rose and Then Fell <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>After the yarn market rose sharply on the 10th, it is now showing a calm situation again. This is because the financial situation is still tight, and new buyers still have little interest. However, the yarn market has been falling for a long time. Some people think that the bottom has been low, so they pulled in to go long. The chips on the table are dry, and the market is strong. According to market rumors, a certain factory owner has absorbed more than 10,000 bales of standard yarn and is preparing to buy it this month, which has led to higher spot prices in recent months.</p>
<p>Recent Spot Yarn Slightly Better</p>
<p>After the standard yarn rose sharply the day before yesterday, today the market hovered and then declined again. Due to previous rumors about the paper money issue, people became frantic again, and the buying momentum rose. Today, all parties have recognized this news, and the popularity has declined. However, a certain bull is still not relaxing, and the intention to receive goods this month is firm, and the market situation is still high. As a result, the prices of each month fell by eight or nine angles per catty compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, only the current month was strong, and the distant months were flat. At the closing of the 13th shot, it was reported that the spot yarn sales were smooth, and the transaction was about 1,300 to 1,400 bales. At present, Mr. Mou has more than 10,000 bales and is temporarily firm, and will never be relieved. If it falls, it may be increased. Generally, retail investors are wary of shorts, but the general trend is still normal. As a result, the prices of each month rose by 1.2, 5, and 6 angles compared with the closing price in the morning. It was found that Tongji sold 500 bales, Dafeng 500 bales, Hexing 700 bales, Gengfeng 650 bales, Changfeng 1,650 bales, Runkang 1,300 bales, Jinchang 650 bales, Ruidai 800 bales, Yuanyi 800 bales, and Changji 500 bales. Yidai bought 750 bales, Yudai 1,800 bales, Daji 790 bales, Junchang 700 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, Yichang 1,900 bales, Yongdai 500 bales, Gengfeng 510 bales, and Changyu 700 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices in one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Actual Demand Can Be Said to Be Smooth</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still relatively developed. According to statistics, the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was 1,309.7, and the market was trending stronger. The price of 10-count coarse yarn rose by 11 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 460 Changsha 285 Mainland 60</p>
<p>Fujian 15 Yunnan 130 Sichuan 380</p>
<p>Xuzhou 45 Peers 2 Wuhu 10</p>
<p>Shantou 10</p>
<p>Most people in the cotton market are bullish on the futures prices in July and August, and there are rumors of a short squeeze. However, the cotton inventory in Shanghai, just in terms of Ling Shi cotton, still has more than 100,000 bales. Moreover, all factories have unanimously reduced and stopped work, and the resumption of work is temporarily delayed. The demand for raw cotton will naturally decrease. However, the cotton market has been falling for a long time, and there may be a turnaround in the short term.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Chen Is No Match for New</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton front market, the prices of each month saw a slight decline. Because the rise of the previous day was too激, most of the floating shorts were cut off. Today, the market is calm, and the price is flat. As a result, the prices of each month fell by 1.5 angles compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the new cotton fell by 3.3 and a half angles. The opening of the afternoon market was dull. The buying momentum was slightly stronger when shooting to 23 plates. The flowers were tighter. The price at the close was soft again. However, most people are temporarily optimistic, and as a result, the prices of each month rose by 5 cents to 1 angle compared with the closing price in the morning. It was found that Hexing sold 1,500 dans, Tongji 9,900 dans, Dafeng 4,500 dans, Jinchang 1,300 dans, Taixing 1,300 dans, Changfeng 1,800 dans, Xicheng 1,000 dans, Shengyuan 6,200 dans, Xincheng 1,800 dans, and Changhe 1,000 dans. Tongxing bought 2,000 dan, Jifeng 1,400 dan, Tongfu 2,300 dan, Yudai 1,100 dan, Yuandai 1,100 dan, Yongdai 3,500 dan, Yifeng 1,500 dan, Changhe 1,000 dan, and Zhendai 1,100 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was initially stable and then fell. Because the weather was clear, the people in the mainland were relieved. However, the market was deeply afraid of the changes in the silver issue, which would inevitably affect the price of goods. Therefore, the initial opening was fixed, and then a part of the bulls, in view of the fact that the price of rice was loosened due to the sweet rain, the price of flour must be tired. Therefore, after the second plate, except for the current month, which was still stable, the rest were soft. Until the afternoon opening price, the current month was very stable due to the near delivery and the small factory chips were slightly replenished. In the long term, the factories slightly hedged and sold each month, and they all fell. This time, the moldy rain was transferred to the dynasty, and the inland waterways were all clear. Or the arrival of wheat can be rushed, and the factory's small outflow is also looking at this. As a result, the current month was better than 7 and a half cents, July fell 7 and a half cents, August fell 1 point and 7 and a half cents, September fell 1 and a half cents, October fell 2 cents and a half, and November fell 2 and a half cents.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Price of Wheat Is Expected to Fall in Sunny Weather—The Number of Spot Arrivals Has Not Yet Opened, and the Opening Price Is Similar— <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, at the opening in the morning, each month saw calm. Chicago foreign wheat reported small triangles, and Canada reported small corners. However, due to the sluggish transaction, the mainland customers' sales were still not strong, so in the calm, they were still able to stand firm. Until the afternoon opening, due to the sluggish flour market, Jing's heavy rain, the sunny light has been released, and after that, the agricultural busy season is over, the waterway is also open, and the arrival of goods will be seen. In the future, according to the rain, the adjustment should be calm. As a result, July fell by 3 points, August fell by 5 points, and September fell by 4 points. The spot wheat market is still stable, because the arrival of goods has not been smooth, and customers' thoughts are all thinking of holding on. The prices of each stall are similar to yesterday. The opening price of Linhuai Guandian wheat is 3 yuan, 4 corners and 6 points, Wuyi Bridge wheat is 3 yuan and 4 corners, Yangzhou wheat is 3 yuan and 3 corners and 7 points, and the second is 2 corners and 3 and a half points. Danyang Nanjing wheat is in Yuan 3 corners and 2 points, Puzhen wheat is 3 yuan and 3 corners and 7 points, Hushou wheat is 3 yuan and 3 corners and a half, Lingjiang wheat is 3 yuan and 5 corners and 4 points, Jiangxinzhou wheat is 2 yuan, 3 corners and 8 points, and Hezhou wheat is 2 yuan, 3 corners and 1 point. The ship wheat in Zhintang Tang City is 3 yuan and 3 corners and 4 points, the second is 3 corners and 1 point, Kunshan wheat is 3 yuan, 4 corners and 1 point, the second is 2 corners and 9 points, Taicang wheat is 2 yuan and 3 corners, and Lujiabang Shuangfeng wheat is 3 yuan and 2 corners and 9 points. Fuxin went to 6,000 bags, Fufeng Xinda each went to 3,000 bags, and Shenshi went to 1,500 bags.</p>

<p>Du Rice (South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs (more than 10 stores, a total of nearly 4,000 stones), the weather turned sunny, but it was still difficult to cheer up, and the sales were still sluggish. The bags moved without refreshing, and there were only more than 100 bags in total. The situation continued to be tired, and the market color was drooping. The prices of various thick japonica rice and thin paddy rice fell by another 1 angle. The change in yin was also tired, and Du Jian was similar. (North of Shanghai) The source was 178 stores. Although the Tiangong turned sunny, the de-icing of various goods still did not rise. The shops took a small amount of short-priced goods. The market price of white japonica rice fell by another 1 angle, the price of early thin paddy rice was reduced by 23 angles, and the price of Baiyuan was about 1 angle lower. The rest were also close to the angle.</p>
<p>Foreign rice, due to the suitable weather and stable hearts, and the de-icing in the mainland, the owners and national households are willing to sell, and the market is falling by several points to a corner. After the market fell, this customer gradually got a better appetite, and the local customers continued to purchase outside. Beiyang Nanjing Jiujiang and other customer gangs all inquired with the market. Although the number of transactions was not much, the market was already active. The city opened 5,500 bags of Saigon, 1,000 bags of Xiaowen, and more than 1,000 bags of Annam Sugendi. The prices of Kexian goods were shouting high, and there was no transaction.</p>

<p>The wheat bran market has been quite chaotic recently. Since the factories opened in large quantities at the beginning of the month, they are often at 1 yuan. The prices quoted by each factory are not consistent due to the amount of inventory. In yesterday's market, brokers are eager to sell the goods in the market, and the price has been as low as 1 yuan and 9 angles. The factories either shout 1 yuan and 9 angles and a half or still shout 2 yuan. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, even the same goods are quoted at inconsistent prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market, due to the initial sunny weather and the need for soybean cake fertilizer for agricultural production, the market was unanimously prosperous and the market rose. However, the ship passenger cake was only sold in Ningbo, and the transaction was weak, and the market price was still fixed. According to statistics, each factory opened 10,000 pieces of 4-Pi cake, with prices ranging from Yuan 3 corners and 3 to 3 corners and 5 Li. There were 300 pieces of Zhengzhuan cake, with a price of 1 yuan, 5 corners and 3 points. There were 1,000 pieces of ship Shahebian cake, with a price of 1 yuan, 4 corners and 4 points. There were more than 600 pieces of civilian ship Qingzhong cake, with a price of 1 yuan, 2 corners and 4 points. There were 500 pieces of ship Niuzhuang Xiyishun cake, with a price of 1 yuan and 5 corners. There were 5,000 pieces of ship Niuzhuang black soybean cake, which were scheduled to be delivered within July-1, with a price of 1 yuan, 2 corners and 7 points.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the transaction of Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian and other roads was extremely prosperous. Each European Zhuang abandoned the old tea and bought Chinese tea because the price of tea on each road was low, and the market gradually stabilized. Yesterday, the city sold a total of more than 4,100 boxes of Zhenmei, Zhenmei, Gongxi, Xia Ya and other green teas. The Zhenmei of Huizhou Huangshan Business Village was the most lively, and the market for core-pulling goods on other roads was also smooth. However, there was no major progress in the low-Zhuang sub-goods.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was weak. The guild divided the plate. The spot price of No. 14 coarse sand white was still 15 yuan and 9 corners and a half, and the price of transshipment goods was 4 yuan and 9 corners. The transaction was not much, and the price did not rise or fall. The Taikoo sugar and the cotton white of this factory were also fresh Xuan Yi. However, the Yongyou of this factory was slightly less than 1 angle, No. 29 and 2 corners, and No. 321 yuan and 1 corner. There was a Chao Gang continuing to open several hundred bags of cotton red, with a price of 11 yuan and 7 corners and a half, which was 2 angles lower than before. Several dozen bags of Bannan Qing were also opened, with a price of 9 yuan and 5 corners and a half. Considering the de-greasing and the price of land, the market is still guarded against further loosening.</p>

<p>Although the transaction of American white iron has not been booming recently, there are not many sources and little inventory. Therefore, the market is still good. The market price per dan is still able to maintain and not fall in the market decline. For example, No. 24 is opened at 11 yuan per dan, No. 6 is opened at 12 yuan and 5 corners, and No. 28 is 13 yuan. Each of the 48 sheets is opened at 1 yuan, 2 corners and 5 points. It was found that 78 dans were traded in yesterday's market, which was taken away by customers from the Yangtze River area. Because of the influence of East goods, there was no instruction in the local business. It is reported that the current inventory is very weak, and the US exchange rate is also changing to expensive news. In the future, the market is expected to be optimistic. As for British and Japanese goods, the current inventory is abundant and the outlet is weak, and the market is sluggish. Although there has been no change in the market price recently, the inside is extremely empty. If the exchange rate turns loose, the market price may continue to be tired.</p>

<p>The market price of white tung oil in Hankou has risen to 40 yuan, and the situation is becoming more and more stable. Last week, Jiaogao Foreign Firm went to 43 yuan and 7 corners, and then fell to 43 yuan. Recently, it has been added to 43 yuan and 2 corners. According to the details of the consecutive days of the Han letter, the source is still scarce, and the purchase of each foreign company is constant at more than 200 tons per week. Therefore, there is a state of supply exceeding demand. The foreign companies in Xiangchuan and other provinces are also purchasing. Therefore, the arrival of goods in the Hankou market is not easy to be prosperous. However, the foreign companies' half-year closing accounts have arrived, and the business must have several periods of stop. The transaction must be reduced this week, and the market will not have a rise in the wind. However, the inventory in the unified market is very thin, and it seems that there is no low-priced hope. The foreign companies in this port also have time to purchase, but the prices are not willing to be enlarged. Although they have sold 478 yuan, only five tons of zero sales cannot be used as a market standard. Zhejiang Tung needs to sell 43 yuan of foot-degree goods to the left. However, according to the estimated price of the foreign company, only 40 yuan of Hangzhou delivery can be calculated, resulting in very few transactions recently. Because the import and export prices have not been met, it is estimated that after the foreign company closes the account, there may be a large number of transactions found at the beginning of the month.</p>

<h3 id="e210">On Gogol's Descriptive Method <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Ding Jun's "On Gogol's Method of Describing Characters" from the "Zishan Tan" on the 22nd, I felt the same way. Indeed, Gogol's "novelistic approach" when introducing characters can significantly impact the integrity and unity of a work. However, strangely, when we read "The Overcoat," "The Nose," and "Dead Souls," we don't feel that his work is fragmented because of it. Instead, we feel it increases the broader social atmosphere of his characters. This is indeed worth pondering deeply.</p>
<p>Originally, in old realist literature, this style of describing characters for a while, or when the characters are brought into the scene, with the author personally stepping forward to speak, was very common. For example, "Dream of the Red Chamber" begins by saying, "This is the first chapter of the book," and then explains the reasons for the book's creation at length. Similarly, in "The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha" and the first chapter of "The True Story of Ah Q," there is a whole series of idle talks that are both true and false. The author is like a storyteller, sitting on a high stool leaning against a table, striking the gavel, and rambling on, with that attitude and demeanor. Sometimes, as in old Chinese vernacular novels, halfway through the story, there's a bit like, "Look, officials, what, what," kind of idle talk. — Those idle talks are mostly the author's feelings or arguments — In my opinion, these parts often use the characteristics of old realism: the so-called flat development of the story, and the static unfolding of the scene, to provide answers. And these characteristics and techniques of old realism seem to be traceable to all kinds of novels and romances, from oral transmission and narration in feudal society, to being moved onto books when the printing industry developed. So no matter how much it tries to break away from the storyteller's attitude, it engages in writing. Once novelists gradually moved away from that era of oral performance (although storytellers still exist in society, such as Chinese storytellers with drums), literary works gradually became non-popular reading materials, and the seriousness of the work gradually increased.</p>
<p>The appearance of characters and the unfolding of scenes in the work are driven by the work itself, and the author is completely hidden behind the book, without revealing any trace of their face. This technique easily captures the reader, allowing them to blend into the work and share the characters' sorrows and joys. This is a common example in the history of literary evolution, both in China and abroad. In Gogol's works, the interjections where he comes forward himself also have this factor involved. But those interjections, and his work are so harmonious and integrated, which relates to his style.</p>
<p>Speaking of Gogol's works that I have read: such as "The Government Inspector," "The Overcoat," and "The Nose," they can mostly be said to belong to the category of satirical literature. But his satirical literature is different from other satirical literature. General satirical literature authors are good at decorating their words with sharp needles, and their appearance is blatant; it is easy for the object of satire to get hurt in their flesh. Gogol's satire, however, combines the work itself with the satirical purpose. The entire work is a sword and a knife, a rifle and a dagger. For example, take "The Nose"! Finding a nose in a loaf of bread, a Collegiate Assessor finds his nose sitting in a carriage as a State Councillor. Or take "The Government Inspector," receiving a Government Inspector and ending up receiving a traveler in the hotel, and even giving away his own daughter in the process. Judging by the story, it can be said to be extremely absurd. It can be said to be extremely unreasonable. However, through this absurd story, through this unreasonable description, the reader sees an extremely real side. And finally, a cold dagger is deeply planted in the reader's heart; making the reader unable to resist, and both laugh and cry. Gogol's authorship has been so popular with readers to this day, and this is where his reason lies. Because truth is the life of all literature. In Gogol's works, we see the living dead souls of the declining landlord class (as depicted in his "Old-World Landowners") and the rotten aristocratic class.</p>
<p>However, in fact, Gogol himself belonged to the aristocratic landlord class. Although he hated the characters in his own class very much, he couldn't get rid of the essential atmosphere of this class. (For example, in "Old-World Landowners," he describes Afanasy Ivanovich and Pulkheria Ivanovna's death entirely with a very sympathetic and compassionate attitude.) And when he wanted to describe these hateful characters, he had to use oblique strokes to avoid factual troubles. Therefore, he created extremely absurd stories to cover up the true face of reality. (In fact, the true face of reality shines through even more because of his clever cover-up.) Since the story is so absurd, then in the development of the writing style, he had to use extraordinary methods; he deliberately disguised himself as a clown, smearing a strip of white powder on his nose, and telling a set of sad jokes. So when we talk about "The Overcoat" and "Dead Souls," even though he inserts large paragraphs of idle talk from time to time, we still feel that the work is integrated, unified, and complete. That is because his extraordinary techniques – form – and the absurd story – content – are very consistent.</p>
<p>In today's China, it seems that there is a great need for authors who can use methods like Gogol's, because the reality we are facing is a very difficult era. I wrote this short essay, although the motive was to answer Mr. Gu Dingjun's inconclusive thinking, but the meaning is to tell Chinese realist writers, when you can't write, learn Gogol's cleverness!</p>
<h3 id="e211">I Also Want to Talk About Sanitary Stinky Tofu <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Old Man Zhitang is dissatisfied with the scientific essays commonly seen in current various Mao publications, and he compares these essays to sanitary stinky tofu. Naturally. Some essays are like stinky tofu. But it is not necessarily the case with scientific essays. Speaking of stinky tofu, it seems to be popular everywhere, but I always feel that only the ones from Changsha are good. I dare to swear that I am not promoting it, especially since I only occasionally buy it to taste, and I have never eaten it as a meal. Changsha's fried tofu may not be particularly wonderful, but it just suits my taste, and that's good enough. As for hygiene, I consider it secondary. Old Man Zhitang also loves to eat stinky tofu. And he only says that the ones from the Gongan and Jingling families are good, each to their own taste, please feel free to choose. But he always wants to introduce the goods from the Gongan and Jingling families to everyone, like a candy seller saying the candy is sweet, and a wine seller saying the wine is good, writing a special book as an advertisement. Then he would inevitably commit the suspicion of promoting sanitary stinky tofu.</p>
<p>Also, Old Man Zhitang believes in fate. He says: "Recently I have come to believe in fate a bit. So, should I go to consult a certain master or astrologer, and ask him to point out the good and bad luck of my fleeting years or my whole life? That is not necessarily the case. I can know these things myself. Because no one knows oneself better than oneself. I believe in fate, not based on my family's Book of Changes divine divination, but on other people's scientific numerology. When I say fate, I mean the individual's innate qualities, now called heredity. When I say luck, I mean the acquired influences, now called environment." — The theory of fate has always been just stinky tofu, even Old Man Zhitang, who is so wise and intelligent, doesn't he know this? If he wants to believe in the theory of fate, he has to make Western-style improvements, especially in hygiene. He distorts the theories of heredity and environment of Western biologists, and turns them into his new theory of fate. He advocates the new theory of fate based on "scientific numerology." This is also like a stinky tofu seller advertising "hygiene." What I think can be likened to sanitary stinky tofu is the so-called "scientific numerology of fate" and "scientific spirit mediumship." But this is not necessarily the same as a scientific essay.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Summer in the Mountain City <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Surrounded by mountains on three sides. The fiery tongues of the sun lick down from the mountain peaks. Scorching the fresh green grass on the mountainside, and even licking the pools of water at the foot of the mountain dry.</p>
<p>The streets of the mountain city. Like in a big, scalding steamer now.</p>
<p>Originally a place without water, the water problem is even more pressing now.</p>
<p>The Daquan well in Siyan Cave at the foot of the mountain runs out of water by noon, but the water carriers with their water carts and buckets still come in batches, scrambling to hoist up the water. The large wooden buckets sway in the deep, seemingly bottomless well, and after swaying for a long time, only half a bucket of yellow mud water is hoisted up. People are still fighting for the yellow mud water.</p>
<p>The riverbed of the Huai River is exposed layer by layer in the sunlight. The water carriers who go to fetch water have to walk down the tiers of banks, and when they reach the water, there is only a thin layer of water, and the large wooden buckets cannot scoop it up. Of course, there is still a lot of water in the center of the riverbed, but the wind and waves are strong, and people cannot stand still when they go into the water; so people are digging holes along the Huai River, and more than a dozen large buckets are taking turns scooping buckets of yellow mud water from the newly dug water holes.</p>
<p>Going up the mountain for tea, the old Taoist priest tells us that the mountain spring has dried up: we see a child scooping mud water with a small spoon in a deep stone depression. After scooping for a long time, he cannot scoop up even half a spoon. The mud water can't be scooped up either.</p>
<p>Everyone is unanimously hoping for rain. It rained a few days ago, but the rain was not heavy enough to make a difference, and only muddy water is still being hoisted up from the well.</p>
<p>Summer in the mountain city is truly unbearable to live in any longer; walking up the street at dusk, the street is filled with a pungent, acrid odor.</p>
<p>Bare-bodied, stark naked children run back and forth in groups, their dirty black bodies covered in rust-like patterns, perhaps they haven't taken a bath in a year or so!</p>
<p>At night, the old and the young lie out in the streets, sleeping in the open air; their bare bodies are displayed in the moonlight.</p>
<p>From seeing teams of mud water buckets on the street during the day, to the exhibition of bare bodies in the streets at night, this place will make you not dare to stay any longer.</p>

<p>— By German writer, Theodor Storm, translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>But Nana wasn't in the hall anymore, the other girls were standing next to their mothers, their mothers were tidying up their straps and ribbons. Mrs. Bolica was bringing in refreshments; she didn't see her daughter either. Now I went to look for Fritz, who was standing next to the music stand in the corner of the room, filling up the empty cups. "Where's Nana?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he replied with a displeased face, "She was silent as a dumb man just now, I don't know why."</p>
<p>I pulled him out into the hallway; as we walked past the room where the guests' coats were placed, we ran into her; she had already put on her coat and wrapped the black silk scarf around her head. "Nali!" I shouted, trying to grab her hand, but she broke free of her hand and walked past us.</p>
<p>"Don't nag!" she said simply, "I'm going home!"</p>
<p>A moment later, she forcefully pulled open the heavy door leading to the street and ran out, jumping and skipping, walking down the steps next to the lamp post. When Fritz followed her to the door, she had already walked far away on the street, and we could only see her running figure in the dark.</p>
<p>"Let her go!" Fritz said, "Are you interested in chasing wild geese?"</p>
<p>I did have this interest: but I didn't know if I should do this. — We had to go back to the hall. Mrs. Bolica went home to take care of something, but came back again before she was finished, — saying that Nali was feeling unwell and was already asleep in bed, her mother's father was sitting next to her.</p>
<p>I felt uncomfortable all night: just as the "Gottingen Dance" that I wanted to dance with Nana was about to begin, I quietly and sullenly went home.</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Luo Fei walked into the manager's office of a certain company, she was here to apply for a job. The manager asked her:</p>
<p>"Are you called Luo Fei?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss Luo, Miss Luo, how old are you?"</p>
<p>"Twenty-three years old."</p>
<p>The manager took out the photo that Luo Fei had sent when she applied and compared it, as if scrutinizing whether the face of the person who came was the same as the photo. This manager of a certain company was short and fat, wearing a neat Western suit, his shirt as white as if it had been brushed with a layer of powder, his hair shiny with oil, so that flies would fall over if they landed on it, his face fleshy and tender, one could imagine that he used cold cream and perfume every year, his eyes were like shooting stars, his mustache was shaped like the Chinese character "eight," and his lips were cracked open, as if deliberately asking him to smile at others more. Yes, the manager was smiling. He continued:</p>
<p>"Miss Luo, your ancestral home is Suzhou, ah."</p>
<p>In fact, Luo Fei's age, hometown, and resume were all clearly written on the application letter, asking or not asking, it was all the same routine.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Ah, Suzhou, I just remembered, Suzhou produces beauties, ah." He stroked his mustache. "No wonder Miss Luo, hahaha, you are so beautiful. Indeed, the reputation is well-deserved." Saying this, he changed the topic and pretended to be very serious, asking: "How well do you type, Miss Luo?"</p>
<p>Luo Fei nodded. She didn't know how to reply. She just felt that the manager's eyes were like two arrows, aiming at her, ready to be shot, his words were also very frivolous, she was anxious in her heart, and her face turned red for a while.</p>
<p>"Are you shy? Really good, really beautiful."</p>
<p>The manager leaned his head further, staring at her tightly, looking her up and down, and then asked: "Are you married?"</p>
<p>"Me?——Later," "I'm not engaged yet."</p>
<p>"Then you are a real Miss, haha, great, great."</p>
<p>Luo Fei was extremely embarrassed, and truly felt that it was the first time in her life that she had been ridiculed by others, and she never let people get away with it, but now, in order to find a job, she had no choice but to endure and not argue with others about these things. Luo Fei wanted to stand up and run out of the manager's office, find Lu Wen, — her husband — who was waiting for her at the pier on the riverbank, and hug him and cry. She was angry, unable to restrain herself, and said seriously:</p>
<p>"Mr. Manager, would you please say less about irrelevant matters?"</p>
<p>"Irrelevant matters? Haha." He stretched out his hand and stroked his oily hair again. "You can't say that, I mean to test whether you are generous — What are you busy with, isn't it good to sit for a while longer? I think you are very good, ah, yes, you are very good, you type and see."</p>
<p>Luo Fei walked to the typewriter and sat down, stretched out her hand, ready to listen to the manager's instructions.</p>
<p>"I'll say it, you follow along and type, okay?"</p>
<p>Luo Fei nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"Ah, great, I'll say it, listen, it's starting. — Friend, why didn't you come yesterday? It doesn't matter if you didn't come, it's not right to make me wait for a long time. Ah, I remember, you were probably entangled by that Miss, right? That Miss of yours is indeed charming, if I were you, I would inevitably be entangled by her and unable to get away, am I right? — Finished."</p>
<p>Luo Fei's hands stopped following along.</p>
<p>"Very fast, very fast, great."</p>
<p>After Luo Fei handed over the paper, she thought to herself: Is this what the female staff in the company do? She couldn't help but laugh to herself.</p>
<p>"You type very well, not a single word is wrong, you are very good." The manager said gleefully. "I'll ask you again, Miss Luo, are you married after all?"</p>
<p>"Not at all!" Luo Fei said very decisively. "But, why do you keep asking me this? Is it relevant?"</p>
<p>"Ah, it's relevant, of course it is, unmarried people are meticulous in their work, and……" (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e217">On Suicide Due to Unrequited Love <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Tie Sheng</p>
<p>This month, I saw the news about Wang Shouchang, a student at the Law School, committing suicide due to unrequited love in the local news column. After reading it, I felt a sense of loss for a long time, and a sense of sadness lingered deeply in my mind. Recently, due to the rapid collapse of the national economy and the desperate situation of the national life, the epidemic of suicide is spreading like the plague at an accelerating rate. The suicide of Wang Shouchang, a university student, is a unique case. As an excellent young man who has received a university education, when the country and society rely on him the most, he suddenly commits suicide due to unrequited love. It is truly pitiful, and laughably foolish! Almost everyone who hears about it scolds him for "not being worth such a sacrifice!"</p>
<p>We know that in this deformed capitalist society, when everything has become a commodity, the bewitching term "love" has also taken on the stench of copper and become commodified. Wealthy merchants and magnates can certainly take it inexhaustibly and enjoy it at will; however, for a poor person who is as poor as a church mouse to want the gift of love, it is truly like a toad wanting to eat swan meat. In this deformed society, "love" has become a deformed existence and a perverted development. "So-called love is mystical," and "love transcends everything," only children who do not understand the ways of the world have such fantasies. In this deformed society, we hope that love will restore its original true face — to be reasonably and satisfactorily resolved by everyone. That can only happen after this unreasonable economic system is thoroughly changed.</p>
<p>We also know that love is not the entirety of life, but merely an optional embellishment on the journey of life. It is good to have it, but it is the same to survive without it. Or it may even reduce the burden of life. We see many people starving to death because they have no food to eat, but we have not seen anyone die immediately because they have no love. Moreover, the mission that the present era has given to us young people is absolutely important. It is permissible for us to sacrifice love for the sake of the mission of the era; but it is absolutely impermissible for us to sacrifice the mission given to us by the era for the sake of love. As the saying goes: "Death can be heavier than Mount Tai, or lighter than a feather." Does Wang Shouchang's suicide due to unrequited love this time give people even a trace of sympathy? As for those who are forced to commit suicide due to the pressure of life, there is still room for pity, however, this is definitely not the correct way out of life. The way out of life is consistent with the way out of society. Only by facing reality, striving through hardship, and overcoming difficulties can one find the true way out of life. I think that if Wang Shouchang had a correct understanding, he would never have made this meaningless sacrifice. May the young men and women who are trapped in the battlefield of love beware of wasting their lives again!</p>
<h3 id="e218">Sishui Night Market <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Lini</p>
<p>Living every day under the scorching sun of the southern country, amidst the bustling atmosphere of traffic and commerce, my frail body and mind have indeed grown a bit weary of the city's prosperity and liveliness. Therefore, the street's hustle and bustle, and the various potent temptations of the amusement parks, even the unique, beautiful, comfortable, and cool nights of the south, can't stir my mood to join the revelry. Nor can they entice me to take a full flask of wine to a quiet and tranquil place, sitting beneath the lush, umbrella-like trees, harmonizing with the silver-bell-like murmuring streams, leisurely playing music. Instead, I always prefer to be listlessly confined in my desolate room, facing the solitary lamp, quietly resting my exhausted spirit. Sometimes, I close my eyes and indulge in foolish reveries, dreaming happy dreams.</p>
<p>But tonight is a bit different. The crackling sound of firecrackers, music, dragon lanterns, costume parades... noisily parade around the entire town. People are packed as tightly as ants, chest to back, back to chest, filling the streets and alleys in rows. This can't help but stir the tranquil sea of my heart. The once-a-year night market, seemingly specially set up for the New Year, has officially opened.</p>
<p>The duration of the night market, as usual, starts three days before New Year's Eve and lasts until New Year's Eve. However, most merchants, for the sake of commercial prosperity, habitually extend it until after the Lantern Festival before ending the night market. The location of the night market originally has a designated place, but those places don't have permanent buildings. Therefore, when the night market is held, temporary bamboo sheds are set up, equipped with bright electric lights, and rented out to various merchants from near and far, displaying and selling all kinds of goods, creating this once-a-year, exceptionally lively night market.</p>
<p>The desolate and quiet room seems to have lost its magic, making my heart yearn for the spring. After taking a cold shower after dinner, I no longer went into the room, squeezed into the layers of the crowd, smelling the strong, turbid, and sweat-sour odor that made my nostrils uncomfortable, and the pungent stimulating scent of betel nuts, and was pushed by the human tide into the market.</p>
<p>The night market is simply an amusement park. Inside, besides people squeezing people and people watching people, there are also those colorful daily necessities and various novelties, such as: leather monkey shows, song and dance troupes, strongmen, airplanes, wooden horses, Ferris wheels, etc. These are all things that I have grown tired of visiting in amusement parks in various cities, and they no longer stir my heartstrings, which made me pay attention to. What can most arouse my attention are those exhibition halls. Their layout, decoration, and explanation can all make me feel satisfied and leave a deep impression. For example, some factories not only display their products but also bring their heavy machinery, and at the same time, actually manufacture goods, so that visitors can know the manufacturing process of a certain product, and express their seriousness in manufacturing, and have a deep impression of a certain commodity.</p>
<p>When I stepped into the exhibition hall of the Health Bureau, suddenly, I deeply felt that their promotion of public health was truly meticulous! What is displayed this year is the dental department. In addition to the associated display of various animal teeth, human teeth, whether they are overlapping teeth, piercing teeth, double teeth, or various forms of teeth with arrangement variations, are all truly unseen and collected exhaustively. At the same time, various facial deformities of patients with various dental diseases are hung on the walls, making people feel frightened at first glance, and their whole body can't help but break out in goosebumps. Turning into the inner room, various models of decayed teeth are displayed inside. Incisors, molars, canines, middle cavities, side cavities, etc., all have quite conspicuous large models. Finally, a microscope is displayed, placing specially made bacterial cultures of decayed teeth on a glass slide under the microscope, allowing visitors to clearly recognize their shape through the microscope. At the exit, many posters reminding people to brush their teeth, as well as photos of clean and beautiful teeth after brushing, are hung. Such education is integrated into entertainment, and the broad effect is far better than in the classroom. This cannot but make me admire the excellent methods of promotion by their executives!</p>
<h3 id="e219">Depression and Loneliness <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Weizhi</p>
<p>In the past, I could only see the words "depression" and "loneliness" in books. At that time, the burden of life had not yet been shouldered. To shout, "depression" and "loneliness," was originally the same as shouting about spring flowers and autumn moons, a kind of pretense to decorate oneself. Leaning in the arms of a lover, seeing the withered flowers and waning moon, then coquettishly: "Life is depressing!" "Life is lonely!"</p>
<p>Not long afterward, stepping from school into the steps of society, I then knew what "depression" and "loneliness" actually were. Seeing my friends gradually aging before these two terms, gradually falling down, I couldn't help but feel a shadow in my heart, feeling that I had also been crawled into my chest by the germs of "depression" and "loneliness." Later, I myself shouldered the burden of life. Moreover, I hit a wall, and my youthful aspirations disappeared in a forced struggle. I no longer had any ambition. I only wanted to make my burden of life more stable, so that it would not collide with others, so as not to add unexpected weight to my burden, so as not to be crushed because of the increased unexpected weight.</p>
<p>Towards my career, I lost my ambition. Towards home, I was a little afraid—home had never given me the slightest benefit! In this way, I knew that my chest not only had "depression" and "loneliness," but was also occupied by "depression" and "loneliness."</p>
<p>I felt more and more lonely, even to the point where I realized that once I fell dead by the roadside, I would only have four pine boards to sleep on. - Giving me pine boards to sleep on is not the kindness of philanthropists. On the contrary, this is their "business," and at the same time, they are afraid that this dead person will bring them the epidemic.</p>
<p>This spring, when the "depression" grew more and more intense, as Hu Kao said, I got a chance to go to Hangzhou. Therefore, half to fulfill a long-cherished wish, and half to treat my "depression," I scraped together a few dollars with great difficulty, mixed in with the ranks of young masters and young ladies, and started my "spring trip."</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, I clearly realized that "depression" and "loneliness" originally had some differences.</p>
<p>That is to say, after arriving in Hangzhou, depression was temporarily forgotten, but what followed was "loneliness."</p>
<p>However, there were many more lonely people. When, on a windy and rainy evening in a hotel, a singing girl who was past her prime desperately shouted with her hoarse voice, I quietly closed the door and cried. Naturally, in the song, I heard her anger.</p>
<p>After a week, I took my slender shadow, and also took "depression" and "loneliness," and still returned to Shanghai. The spring trip did not cure my "depression" and "loneliness."</p>
<p>In order to get rid of "depression" and "loneliness," I began to seek stimulation, to seek stimulation as much as possible. Using alcohol, using dancing, using all meaningless and boring actions to temporarily numb my nerves.</p>
<p>However, I couldn't. All the stimulation was not enough to numb me. On the contrary, all the stimulation made me even more painful. The wound of "depression" did not heal, and I discovered more souls of "loneliness."</p>
<p>Now, I don't want to seek stimulation anymore. I only want to enjoy loneliness quietly, letting my soul glue to the silken threads of loneliness. This world is lonely, and in loneliness, I should learn something.</p>
<p>When the hell of loneliness is broken, or perhaps the shackles of "depression" can also be removed.</p>
<p>But when will the hell of loneliness be broken? Friend!</p>
<p>It's okay to have no companion, just step forward on the journey alone. Isn't that long shadow illuminated by the moonlight your best companion?</p>
<p>Drag your slender shadow, sing your song of loneliness with your hoarse voice. Human life is lonely, but there are many who feel the loneliness of human life.</p>

<p>His heart was conflicted; his thoughts all day long revolved around this point, but after racking his brains to think, he still couldn't find a solution, sometimes to the point of a headache.</p>
<p>He was over fifty years old this year. Although he had four sons, one had died, and another had gone missing at the age of fifteen. Now, only two remained. In the years when business was still good, he always thought of his eldest son, who had gone missing. He thought, "If he comes back, this business can be handed over to him." But now? He was still thinking, but his thoughts were different from before. He didn't want him to come back to manage the business, but hoped that his son would suddenly make a fortune and return.</p>
<p>He often said to the two sons living at home: "Although your eldest brother doesn't do proper work, he is very smart. After being outside for more than ten years, if he is still alive, he will definitely make a fortune. The fortune teller said when he was young that he would definitely make a fortune after he turned thirty. Now he is over thirty, so he will definitely come back."</p>
<p>Old Zhou had been saying these words to his two sons for several years, but he was always waiting, but he didn't see his son who was going to make a fortune return.</p>
<p>The depression in the town was getting worse and worse. Shops were closing down on the street every day, which made it impossible for Old Zhou to continue to support himself. But he still wanted to struggle; he didn't want to see this ancestral shop closed with those dilapidated door panels in his hands. He tried every method, but everything was useless. The most important fact was that no one came to trade. Although there was no income, expenses were unavoidable. In the end, he sent his two remaining sons to other places to seek their own livelihood. Only he and his old wife were left. The oil shop was still open as usual, but for a long thirty days, there were only a few customers. Spiders were weaving webs on those oil tanks.</p>

<p>— Nan</p>
<p>The General deeply understood that Poland was surrounded by strong neighbors coveting its land. To maintain domestic and international peace and avoid invasion by enemy countries, it was necessary to train the strongest possible army to resist foreign aggression at any time. Therefore, he devoted himself to training the army, and its strength grew day by day. In 1920, the Russian Red Army pressed on the border, threatening the newly liberated Poland. After several bitter battles, the Russian Red Army was as unstoppable as a broken bamboo, directly approaching Warsaw, only eight miles from the city. At this time, the General used his intelligence and bravery to lead the newly trained army in a fierce counterattack. After two weeks of fierce fighting, he completely defeated the enemy. He safeguarded the peace of Poland and all of Europe. His achievements were most remarkable. At that time, Poland's situation was indeed extremely critical, and all countries believed that Poland's life had been extinguished. When the victory spread, the world was shocked, because the disparity between the strong and the weak was so great that there was no chance of victory unless the officers and soldiers all embraced the determination to die. The reputation of the Polish army soared. In this battle, the General captured 115,000 Red Army soldiers, 390 cannons, 7 armored vehicles, 2,000 machine guns, and 1,000 freight cars of military supplies and industrial materials, and 2,600 trains. The Red Army's four combat armies, the 111th Army, were completely annihilated, and the remaining two armies suffered extremely heavy losses. After the war, the General actively focused on domestic construction, improving the political, economic, social, and cultural situation, and integrating the opinions of various political parties to concentrate forces and revive the country.</p>
<p>The General was not a dictator, but a great educator. However, overseas countries regarded him as a dictator. In fact, this term was not carefully chosen. The term dictator can be applied to Mussolini, Hitler, and Kemal, but the General should be regarded as "The Deciding Factor" in Poland, which is more realistic. The General's foreign policy was the same as his domestic policy, aimed at giving Poland the opportunity to develop and achieve peace. In other words, the foreign policy was a policy of land neighbors, making Poland friendly with its two strong neighbors, Russia and Germany, and signing non-aggression treaties.</p>
<p>The General sacrificed himself for his country throughout his life. First, for the independence of the country, and second, for the great development and promotion of the country's future. Before his death, the General was able to see Poland become stronger and respected by various countries, and the continuous efforts of the entire country, both government and public, to steadily overcome the difficulties of the world economic recession and currency wars, and move forward to a bright future, which was truly a very fortunate thing. The General has now completed his work, which the Polish people have been unable to do for thousands of years. The General is dead, but the memories of his teachings, deeds, and achievements, and his spirit of endless struggle, will never diminish. The General is not only a leader, but also a modern liberator, educator, and builder of Poland. The General is Poland, and he will forever reside in the hearts of the Polish people, and will exist forever with the Polish nation. (The End)</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Three years ago, I partnered with friends to start a cotton yarn company. The capital was a total of 12,000 yuan, and I invested 3,000 yuan. The store is managed by the major shareholder, Mr. Wang, who handles everything. At first, business was not bad, but in the past year or two, due to the impact of the economic panic and the current situation, it has gradually been losing money. Considering my weak financial resources, I am deeply afraid that if I continue vaguely, I will lose a large sum in the future. Not only will my years of hard work be in vain, but I may also be responsible for liquidation at that time, which I will not be able to afford. Therefore, I contacted the manager, Mr. Wang, and requested to withdraw and take back the remaining capital. However, Mr. Wang refused, based on some unknown point, which really puzzled me. I don't know if my request is unreasonable. Please give me an indication. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Zhang Wengeng</p>
<p>Editor's note: Failure is the mother of success. Setbacks before the success of a great undertaking are inevitable. Therefore, we feel that if Mr. Zhang has strong financial resources and believes that the company has the hope of development, then we should advise him not to be discouraged and continue to do so. As long as he can continue to work hard, the future can be optimistic. However, according to the letter, Mr. Zhang's financial resources do not seem to be very strong. Then, for the sake of prudence, it is certainly right to want to break away from the relationship and reduce the risk.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn company is a partnership business. Each shareholder bears full and unlimited liability for the profits and losses of the store. If it continues vaguely, the responsibility is very heavy. Therefore, the law stipulates that after the annual accounts are settled, shareholders have the right to apply for withdrawal. Mr. Zhang can argue on the basis of reason and negotiate with Mr. Wang. If a compromise can be reached, it must still be declared in the newspaper truthfully. Otherwise, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang's non-public procedures cannot resist "unknowing third parties" in law, and disputes cannot be avoided. In the event that Mr. Wang insists on not allowing it, Mr. Zhang can declare in the newspaper that he has separated from the company since a certain time, and at the same time, submit it to the court for record. As for the negotiation of recovering the remaining capital, it should be carried out in another case.</p>

<p>Miss Zhou Xuan, who was elected as one of the three major singers, has officially entered the film industry. We look forward to her with the same anticipation as we once had for Yuan Meiyun. At the same time, Miss Zhou's petite and charming demeanor and her polite attitude make us feel that she is more promising.</p>
<p>Yi Hua Film Company spent a lot of money to cultivate Yuan Meiyun. Now, they are continuing their efforts with even greater determination to help this talented young girl, Zhou Xuan, succeed as a bright star in the Chinese film industry. This shows the spirit and courage of Yi Hua.</p>
<p>In fact, this young girl discovered by Yi Hua does have the potential to be cultivated. She has already taken on the role of Miss Doctor in the film "Doctor's Wife," directed by Yue Feng, which is a typical modern Miss. Yue Feng views Zhou Xuan even more highly than he viewed Yuan Meiyun when he was filming "The Wrath of the China Sea." He says daily, "Zhou Xuan is truly a promising talent."</p>
<p>Now, we sincerely hope that Miss Zhou will work hard so that the throne in the future film palace will be waiting for Miss Zhou to sit on.</p>

<p>The era of "The Storm" has arrived! Roar, Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Look! The ambitious invading countries are again wielding their sharp new-style cannons, airplanes, poison gas... attacking our weak nation!</p>
<p>Are we still going to be arbitrarily slaughtered and invaded as before? No, we can no longer be as weak and tolerant as before. It is time for us to rouse our spirits and resist! We should stand on a single line and fight desperately against the enemy, taking on the rise and fall of the nation! Roar, Chinese nation!</p>
<p>In the sound film "The Storm," directed by Yuan Congmei and produced by Yi Hua, there is a tragic and passionate performance of national self-salvation!</p>
<h3 id="e228">About Nora <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Ibsen's dramas depict each character's life very vividly. Take the play Nora, for example. His narrative of the personalities of the five main characters is lively and vivid. He writes about the contradictions of human nature, good and evil, and the entanglement of love between men and women. He gives an answer in the midst of not finding an answer. This amateur theater group's first joint performance is performed by five of the most skilled stage actors. Each actor can understand the characters that Ibsen wanted to write.</p>
<p>The overall stage performance has a beautiful and tranquil taste. It is a story from 19th-century Northern Europe, so it has the style of the film "Grievance of a Young Woman." Furthermore, it narrates the situation of celebrating Christmas, so it also has the beautiful sentiment of Andersen's "The Little Match Girl." The snow scene outside a large window in the set is simply a portrayal of that fairy tale.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Hollywood Silver Wave United Artists Company's Plans After Reform <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>United Artists Company was originally organized by the four giants "Pickford, Chaplin, Fairbanks, and San Gawen." Recently, due to the departure of its former general manager and the appointment of a new one, its internal structure has been greatly reformed. In addition to the original producers, David O. Selznick, the current MGM supervisor, has been hired as the general supervisor. James is truly one of the leading producers. His famous works include "A Tale of Two Cities," "Dinner at Eight," and "Viva Villa!" After joining United Artists, James will produce six films each year.</p>
<p>Chaplin has been absent for four years since he met the audience in "City Lights." His new film will be released soon, and it is expected to be released this fall. The title has not yet been decided, and it is temporarily named "Production No. 5." According to Chaplin himself, the content is quite simple, depicting the lives of two workers. Although this film has music, it still has no dialogue. After this work, Chaplin plans to direct a film with Goddard as the female lead.</p>
<p>In United Artists Company's 1936 productions, in addition to the aforementioned Chaplin's new work, the films produced by Corwin and starring Edith Contay and Anna Sten are also excellent. Other productions such as those by King Vidor and the London Company are still distributed by United Artists.</p>

<p>To the Shenbao Newspaper Office:</p>
<p>Yesterday I read the "Notice to Unemployed Friends" column in your newspaper's local supplement, which stated, "Now we need to hire a Chinese secretary. Those who are fluent in Chinese and willing to work, please send a letter to Mr. Zhu Weiyu of the Zhonghua Book Company on Henan Road." We have checked and found that our company has neither advertised for a Chinese secretary nor has a person named Zhu Weiyu. Please publish this letter in</p>

<p>— Gu Ying</p>
<p>Timber imports in the first four months of this year increased by four million compared to the same period last year. Since the implementation of the new tax, cement imports are only one-fifth of what they were three years ago.</p>
<p>Living and transportation are essential elements of life. Therefore, the expansion of the population and the progress of the construction industry go hand in hand. In recent years, the construction industry has also advanced with the population. Unfortunately, building materials such as timber, cement, and steel are mostly imported goods, and Chinese people are happy to use them. Therefore, the import of foreign timber and other materials increases year by year. Since the increase in tariffs on cement and the implementation of the new tax, imports have decreased significantly. The rise and fall of the construction industry in this city in recent years, as well as the comparison of timber and cement imports, are described below for reference:</p>
<p>1.  Construction in This City</p>
<p>Since this city was opened as a commercial port during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, it has been vigorously managed by Chinese and foreign people. Commerce and industry have become increasingly prosperous, and the population has increased. As of now, the city's population has reached more than 3.5 million. Therefore, the booming construction industry is to be expected. Taking the total construction amount of the city in the recent eight years as an example, the total annual construction amount of the city in the 16th year of the Republic of China was 15,263,552 taels (silver standard). It gradually increased to 71,511,816 taels (silver standard) in the 19th year of the Republic of China, which is more than 3.67 times the amount in the previous four years. The reason is the sharp increase in population and the investment of real estate developers. This period can be called the golden age. Later, due to natural disasters, man-made disasters, and the impact of the economic downturn, coupled with the outbreak of the January 28 Incident, paradise was regarded as a dangerous place. Some wealthy households moved to the interior, and real estate developers did not dare to invest. Therefore, the city's construction statistics in the 21st year of the Republic of China decreased by more than one digit compared to the 19th year, only 35,541,100 taels (silver standard). As of last year (23rd year), although it did not decrease, it still could not catch up with the huge number in the 19th year. A comparative table of the total number of buildings in the past eight years is shown below:</p>
<p>Year　Total Annual Construction Amount</p>
<p>16　15,263,552 taels</p>
<p>17　32,356,986 taels</p>
<p>18　45,386,682 taels</p>
<p>19　71,511,816 taels</p>
<p>Year　Total Annual Construction Amount</p>
<p>20　62,351,250 taels</p>
<p>21　35,541,009 taels</p>
<p>22　58,268,150 yuan</p>
<p>23　64,112,000 yuan</p>
<p>In recent years, with the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the decline of various industries, and the global economic downturn, the decline in construction volume is also a phenomenon that should be seen. However, it is still able to stand at a total construction volume of more than 64 million yuan each year, an increase of 5,843,850 yuan compared to the previous year, presenting a thriving trend. There are two reasons for this: First, the inland areas are facing continuous disasters and life is difficult. Therefore, people in the inland areas are seeking a way out in the cities. As the population increases in the cities, it is necessary to find accommodation. For example, opening up barren areas and building affordable housing in the Greater Shanghai area, as well as large-scale construction in the city center. Second, the development of high-rise buildings in the concessions. Whether the buildings have been built or not, they are all implementing the principle of occupying the sky but not the land, and actively increasing their height. With these two points, it is appropriate that the construction industry is not declining. Of the total amount of 64,112,000 yuan in the city last year, the public concession accounted for 27,601,000 yuan, followed by the Greater Shanghai area with 23,735,000 yuan, and then the French concession with 12,776,000 yuan. It can be seen that the efforts in building in the Greater Shanghai area are not weak compared to the concessions. Since the construction industry in this city is as described above, the construction factories operating in this industry are naturally very developed. There are currently more than 2,000 factories in the city, of which more than 1,000 have the scale of construction factories. The rest are construction factories that only undertake part of the work, such as decoration, painting, or renovation, woodworking, etc., which are called construction factories. As for those with a larger scope, there are only more than 200 factories.</p>
<h3 id="e234">The Latest Theater Design in the United States (Part 1) <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Original by B.A. Hueton, translated by Xiao Ang</p>
<p>The United States is a very wealthy country, and most of its people are rich. Therefore, there are a particularly large number of entertainment venues. According to statistics, there are more than 100 large theaters in New York City, not including the small ones. Although Shanghai's theaters are very developed, I am afraid they are far behind. Recently, due to business competition, the owners of the theaters have gradually paid attention to the form and design of the theater buildings. One theater with the most abundant capital wanted to renovate the theater due to the sluggish business in recent months, so it publicly sought design drawings. The young architect Hueton became famous because of this. His design is indeed precise and thoughtful, worthy of being a genius architect. I am now going to introduce his design very simply, which will definitely be of great help to the architectural community in Shanghai. At the same time, it may also be a considerable encouragement to young architects.</p>
<p>(1) Choice of Location</p>
<p>The theater should be located in an area with convenient transportation and the largest population. The most important thing is to be on the main lines of the city's roads, such as near the Great Road and the French Great Road in Shanghai, which is very suitable. At the same time, the theater should be near the parking lot and the drop-off entrance should be on one side, because too far or having to cross the road will disappoint movie fans. The front of the theater should have a very wide road, because the cars of the ladies and wives will come one after another shortly before the play starts, especially on rest days and when good films are playing. If there is no very wide road, I am afraid there will be accidents. The large theaters in Shanghai do not pay attention to this point and should be improved.</p>

<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>—About Use in Construction Sites—</p>
<p>Trowel—The "portable treasure" that a mason cannot leave behind is the trowel and iron plate. The trowel is almost always used when building walls. However, the trowel itself is sometimes used by the mason to represent the measurement of feet as a standard for the number of layers. It is generally calculated based on the length of the trowel (that is, the section of the back of the blade and the handle). Generally, a 2-fen gray joint (detailed previously) is considered one layer, then the length of the trowel is suitable for five layers. Because the first thing to pay attention to when building a wall in a clear water area is the gray joint, so as to avoid the disadvantages of being crooked. The mason then came up with this method.</p>
<p>Iron Plate—Masons must use an iron plate for brushing, whether it is scraping, powdered lime, or fine sand. There is also a kind called steel skin iron plate, which is twice as big as the ordinary one. It is almost indispensable when encountering powdered gypsum. Because the texture of the steel skin iron plate is smooth and clean, powdered gypsum must be fine and smooth, so the ordinary iron plate cannot be used.</p>
<p>Clear Water—The original appearance of the wall surface without brushing any material is called clear water. If it is mixed with cement, lime, fine sand, gypsum, or polished stone, etc., it is collectively called mixed water.</p>
<p>Sprayer—The brick material used for building walls must first be soaked in water. If it is impossible to do so, it must be watered sufficiently. Because the brick material itself is dry, the mason will scrape the sand and mud onto the brick block and build it on the wall without asking why if they do not water or soak it. If it is in a sunny place, it will not be able to withstand the sun and night dew. The wall body that should be used for thirty years will become more than ten years. Therefore, it is necessary to fully irrigate the brick material with water. Supervisors must not be negligent. At the same time, the bricks on the scaffolding are watered on the scaffolding with a sprayer. Therefore, this kind of thing is also indispensable in the construction site.</p>
<p>Crane—In recent years, the construction situation in construction sites is not like before, building two or three-story street houses, etc., thinking that it is a big project. In recent years, there are many tall buildings that reach into the clouds in Shanghai alone that have been completed. However, the construction of this kind of large building mostly uses I-beams as the main material for construction. However, the weight of each I-beam cannot be carried by human power, so the crane car has to be used to help the lack of manpower. As for what the shape of the crane is, it has three legs and a long neck, almost exactly like the shape of a crane, so it is called a crane car. In fact, the translated sound is a crane. Its price is very high, and it is not easy for a small capital construction site to buy.</p>
<p>Property Sign—The section on the ridge of the gable (detailed earlier) (which is commonly known as the fire wall) that rises and drags to the eaves and then steps back level by level to the wall body is called the property sign.</p>
<p>Contract—A contract is a regulation for setting up a project</p>
<p>Washer—If the rotating place of the screw is too long, use a washer to support it. It is a square or round iron piece. In the construction site, it is also called dried tofu.</p>
<p>Shaking Class—The organization of a construction site encompasses the power of the masses. It cannot be successfully achieved by individual authority. Therefore, in the construction site, whether it is the supervisor in the accounting room or the "small business" brought by the workers, all parties should unite and be friendly to each other, unless they take actions outside of the work. It is not allowed to be intimidating. And especially the supervisors in the relief room. Almost everyone has sufficient knowledge and considerable intelligence. They should guide the workers step by step, because the workers do not understand the principles. If the two sides break down, it is easy to feel棘手 and helpless. Sometimes the public anger is aroused, and maybe the whole strike. However, a construction site does not call it a strike, but it is called shaking class. Shaking class is the most taboo thing in a construction site. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Lead, Tin, Nickel, Magnesium</p>
<p>Section 1: Lead</p>
<p>Lead is also a sulfide mineral. Its smelting first involves calcination to remove sulfur and convert it into lead oxide. Then, minerals are used to remove oxygen to obtain lead. Lead's color is grayish-white and it is extremely heavy, weighing about 0.41 pounds per cubic inch. It is highly ductile but cannot withstand high compressive forces. Its tensile strength is only 500 pounds per square inch, and the highest is no more than 2,400 pounds. Its use in the construction industry is for various water and electrical distribution pipes.</p>
<p>Section 2: Tin</p>
<p>Tin is an oxide mineral, mostly produced in England. It is ductile and easily fusible. It is used in the construction industry for small items. Its manufacture and refining are the same as other metallic materials, washing, smelting, and polishing are all that is needed.</p>
<p>Section 3: Nickel</p>
<p>Nickel is a silver-white metal. Its ore belongs to sulfides. It is highly ductile and has a strong power. Each square inch can withstand an external force of 160,000,000 pounds. It can be used as stainless various building supplies.</p>
<p>Section 4: Magnesium</p>
<p>Magnesium is a light metal, weaker than aluminum, but its applications are almost the same. Its strength is also considerable.</p>
<p>Section 5: Comparison of Properties of Various Non-Ferrous Metals</p>
<p>Category Tensile and Compressive Resistance (pounds per square inch) Flexural Resistance (pounds per square inch) Hardness Elongation (percentage per 2-inch unit) Weight per Cubic Inch (pounds)</p>
<p>Copper 32,000 10,000 47 56 0.320</p>
<p>Quick-set Copper 52,000 16,000 —— 13 0.320</p>
<p>Nickel 69,000 28,000 90 45 0.320</p>
<p>Quick-set Nickel 166,000 40,000 —— 12 0.320</p>
<p>Zinc 24,000 —— —— 35 0.270</p>
<p>Aluminum 23,000 10,500 45 16 0.093</p>
<p>Magnesium 32,500 7,800 41 6 0.065 (End of the article)</p>
