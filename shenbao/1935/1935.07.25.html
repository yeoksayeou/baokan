<h3 id="c25">日本陸軍將佐大更動之意義 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>日本陸軍省自敎育總監眞崎甚三郎被迫辭職以來。對於內部。似有澈底整理之趨勢。最近據日聯社消息。林陸相已奏准日皇。將於八月一日正式發表陸軍將佐大更動之命令。遷調人數。計達三千五百左右。軍事參議官菱刈隆及松井石根大將第二師團長秦眞次中將。均在免職之列。此次陸軍方面空前之更動。雖因關係複雜。前途尙難逆料。然要可謂爲現陸相林銑十郎陸軍統制政策之成功也。</p>
<p>日本陸軍省素來內幕複雜。派別紛歧。自荒木下臺後。內部暗潮愈演愈烈。林陸相所以曾屢表消極者。實因駕馭爲難耳。目下陸軍省派系。約言之。可分三派。（一）統制派。以林陸相爲中心。現軍務局長永田佐之。新任敎育總監渡邊錠太郎及阿部本莊南等軍事參議官。則爲林陸相政策之支持者。（二）正義派。以眞崎爲中心。其幕內人物爲柳川秦眞次香椎香月等師團長。及小畑山岡等少將級官佐。（三）淸軍派。以小磯松井等爲主要分子。以上三派同屬軍部。然共政策各有出入。林陸相素以穩健著名。頗得元老電臣及產業主之信任。且與宇垣亦頗接近。爲一此較中立之人物。眞崎大將原屬佐賀閥之西南派。與右派浪人甚爲接近。對林陸相感情素來不睦。小礎一派勢力較爲薄弱。與眞崎派亦時有衝突。此三派中勢力最大者。則素爲眞崎派也。</p>
<p>眞崎大將在此對立之形勢下。其不慊於林陸相而謀有所更張也明甚。本年一月會與政友會總務久原房之助密會於麻布區南方院。眞崎派提供材料。攻擊軍部缺乏統制能力。（華聯社訊）本年五月。中日兩國互換大使之際。日軍部中一部份軍人頗持異議。聞亦與眞崎有關。足證兩派之明爭暗　。己非一日。</p>
<p>此次林陸相　所以毅然决然。以敏捷之手段。謀內部障礙之肅淸。老一方面固由於林氏之果斷。另一方面實　　　恃　　　蓋自五月中旬日本內閣　議會成立以來。軍部穩健派與元老重臣貴族及產業主之勢力結成一體。此種結合。爲新舊兩方激盪而成之新形勢。林陸相因得元老重臣之擁護。其勢力更形鞏固。今遂進而實行貫徹軍部統制政策矣。</p>
<p>基上所述。吾人可知此次日本陸軍將佐之大調動。决非偶然。個中意義。對內則在迎合一般傾向保守主義者之心理。對外則在形成軍部與外部政策之一體。使外交政策之實施。更爲有步調有計劃有效果。至其基本方針。固未嘗有所變更。故今後對華政策。自必「一以貫之。」卽有差別。亦不過緩急之分而已。</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>從上海到漢口（下）</p>
<p>皖贛邊境馬當對面、屬江西彭澤與秋浦東流毘連之馬華堤、內因積水難以宣洩、外因洪流猛擊、竟於本月上旬、先後潰决二三處、兩省在圩內之村舍田禾、均吿湮沒、損失不可勝計、按該堤寬一丈五、高出水位數寸數尺不等、其潰决非因漫溢冲蕩、猛然倒榻、而爲新堤尙未修築堅固、致涓流滲漏、遂成大患也、自安慶西上、災情愈見餒重、堤岸完整者、禾苗秀綠、仍可望其豐收、若圩堤潰决者、則汪洋一片、毫無作物踪影、惟偶得露梢陌柳、藉可測知畎畝之形而已、且有數處、江面堤圩、均甚高於兩旁田地、村舍尾宇、自亦處於水位之下、江堤一旦潰决、洶湧橫流、遂一發不可收拾、災區旣極廣大、潰水又以堤身過高、一時難以退去、爲禍之烈、尤甚於黃河之災害、故治江之道、不專在防堤之增高、而亟應注重水道之疏濬、亦已曉然矣、</p>
<p>九江水亦上岸、一·二·三·大中·濱江。等各馬路、水深各三四尺、行人多以洋車或小船代步、甘棠湖旁之居民、均居住水中、廬山路亦有一段浸水、不能駛車、內部湖泊多已汜濫、鄱陽湖一帶民圩潰决、凡百餘處、此次贛省水災區域、據有報吿者、多至四十五縣、其成災皆以霪雨連綿、洪水暴漲所致、如婺源各村及西門水位、均高出城墻、貴溪難民浮居屋項、呼救無應、死亡無算、永修三十八圩概被冲潰、淹斃人口千餘、新建洪水饑饉交迫、飢民煎草爲食、腹脹而死者尤多、其慘狀皆不忍聞也、</p>
<p>十九日午過武穴、沿江民房下部均浸水中、輪未停泊、僅遙攝一影、中振會委員長許世英氏、一行六人、西來勘災、雖幸同輪、但許氏輪行則攬鏡遠望、並以圖嘗參照、輪止則查勘指導當地之防務、終日憂思勤勞、實少與外界接談之機會、是晚將抵漢口、特專誠請敎其感想、</p>
<p>據談要點、略謂「此次水災、各地官民、對於防禦工作之能力、已較勝於前、惟社會經濟與救災之能力、却遠不如前、與各省當局商議急振工振與治標之辦法、中央當盡力補助、將來得到各處實况後、回京當切實報吿中央、使明瞭水災之厲害、人民之痛苦、至於治水之道、非籌得鉅欵、（約總額五萬萬元）通盤計劃、從江淮河漢、根本導治、則今後之水害較之今次當更尤甚也」據另一方面消息、許氏對籌劃治水鉅欵、已有較可實行之善策、惟未徵得中央同意、故發表尙有待耳、</p>
<p>翌晨到達漢口、卸裝旅館、就近往江漢關附近一行、水位爲五〇·七呎、較前雖已稍退、但堤外之臨江路、仍爲江水所激蕩、時有一龜、被浪捲涸於堤坡上、一孩捉之欲歸、衆恐得罪龍王、堅令復縱於江、此雖迷信細事、然亦可見羣情內懼之一斑、各馬路外洩於江之溝水、因江水高於路面、恐受倒灌影饗、特設排水機、翻堤傾瀉於江、當水位較高之前數日、市民凜於二十年之創痛、大半紛紛遷家、由卑登高、商店重要存貨、尤多喬遷二三層樓、</p>
<p>渡江至粵漢路徐家棚車站、見通某轉運公司之軌道、已被冲毀十數丈、車站碼頭、更以無蓬鐵車、扣連爲橋、步行雖甚安穩、究以大材小用爲惜、附近民房、尤多漂沒水中、視其門窗水痕、有爲鴨黃帶綠色者、約高水面尺許、係前數日曾令人惶駭無似之水位、再高尺許、尙有一片淡褐色、是卽二十年大水災之慘跡也、記者當展鏡攝影時、見浸水之樓房上、一菜色少婦、依欄抱孩、旋抖旋哼曰、「毛毛不要再哭了、有人來查水災了、快有東西給我們吃了、毛毛不要哭了……」聞之心際不勝隱隱作痛、雖然、武漢災情慘重之處、蓋尙在張公堤丹水池·曬甲山·金銀潭·姑嫂樹一帶、此其不過小焉者也、</p>
<p>鄂省江漢縈繞、號稱澤國、每屆夏秋之交、輙苦泛瀾成災、二十年二十二年之　創未已、今秋又復慘遭其魚之禍、上游則洪波震壑、山崩地圻、下游則奔騰洶湧、千里汪洋、各地向省府呈報災情者、截至二十二日止、已達四十九縣之多、據許振委員長一行凌空俯瞰所得、凡江漢上游十餘縣、莫非一片汪洋、中如天門·漢川。災情最重之縣、全境均在水中、其他能見城垜屋頂樹梢者、爲數亦屢極少、災民成千累萬、流離失所、均有待於拯救也、</p>

<h3 id="c96">王用賓談　出巡七省目的　督促廓淸宿案指導推行新法 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>司法行政部長王用賓、當視事之初、即有巡視各省司法實際狀况之計、嗣以部務紛繁、行期遂一再展緩、比因新刑法與三級三審制頒佈施行、將屆一月、王氏爰將部中重要公務、漏夜處理、期於本月底啟行、其巡視路綫、預定爲山東·河北·察哈爾·綏遠·山西·陝西·河南。七省、擬定一個月飞事、俾得返京出席九月中旬啟幕之全國司法會議、日日社記者以王氏成行在邇、昨特趨詢此次巡視之主要對象、當承一一見吿、茲誌其談話如左、</p>
<p>指導推行新法</p>
<p>王氏首　、當新刑法新刑訴民訴與三級三審制實行後、本部早經　派專員、分赴各地督促指導、但各省推行成績如何、積案已否廓淸、殊有親往巡視之必要、查中樞改變法制之命意、在謀减免當事人精神物質意外之損害、目前推行之第一步、尤重肅淸積案、俾於審訊執行、兩得其利、余於此行、將一面嚴定限期、督促理淸宿案、一面詳加指導、務使推行新法、了無　義、蓋當國家大法方始變革、率行機關、難免不發生困難疑竇、而有待於指示解釋者也、</p>
<p>矯正覊延風氣</p>
<p>過去各地司法機關、對於刑事案件、往往箱口詳密偵查、搜羅證據、延不判結、牽連各犯、多有在看守所覊押經年而猶未經提訊者、如最近某地有一八十餘歲老者、因輕案被押、結果竟因不堪縲絏之苦、庾死看守所中、此類情事、於良心上實感不安、倘案早定讞、則犯人應科之罪、固可迅予執行、嫌疑寃抑者、亦能早得開脫平反、如果遷延不决、不特無罪者平白遭拘禁之痛、犯罪者亦增加覊押之苦、甚至覊押時日、超出刑期、其反國家法治精神、與予國家生產、人民生命事業之損失、寗堪勝計、此項風氣、苟不嚴厲矯正、不特無以使囹圄一空、轉將有人滿之患矣、故余此行必力謀改正之、</p>
<p>疏通看所押犯</p>
<p>對於各地看守所、疏通押犯、余將特別注意、蓋監獄爲已經確定之罪犯執行徒刑之所、祇須考察其囚糧。衛生。教誨。設施。情形、看守所則爲覊押之所、被覊押者均未能判定其是否犯罪、良善公民因微涉嫌疑而被押者、亦所在皆有、其待遇設備及處置情形、自應較監獄稍優、但事實上各地看守所反都因陋就簡、益以年來刑事案件增加、覊押人數日多、看守所之亟待疏通、尤爲當前切要問題、茲次立法院已逝過疏通監獄人犯辦法、而看守所之疏通、則惟在督飭保釋及迅予結案　、</p>
<p>曉諭良心責任</p>
<p>王氏末謂、余此次出巡、將以「法官平時操守應與良心責任並重」之義、愷切曉諭各司法官吏不能顧慮及當事人實際上所受之痛苦損害、此則其對於法官本身之職守、固無瑕可擊、而於良心上之責任、實有歉愧、例如過去各地法官、往往對於可覊押可不覊押者、輒予覊押、可起訴可不起訴者、輒予起訴、及其判决或已執行者、亦往往對於緩刑及假釋、類多吝而不予、只求减輕自己賣任、而不顧身受其苦者之痛苦、若此、如何能與國家立法所以設此實宥條文之精神相符云云、查王氏此次預計所巡視之各省、皆係前部長羅文榦未去之區域、該部參事楊鵬、科長王登第、廖維勳、秘書陳大器等五人、將隨同視察、聞王氏俟將來時間上有可能時、將於歸途並視察蘇皖兩省一部份法院、（日日社）</p>

<p>辦理婦嬰衛生</p>
<p>我國一般婦女、因生產僱用舊式穩婆接生、而遭犧牲者、不知凡幾、蓋穩婆對產婦臨產時、每用破磁與碎玻璃及鐵剪刀等剪斷嬰孩臍帶、不明消毒方法、旣無接生技術、且乏科學知識、因之嬰孩發生臍帶風、（即破傷風俗名七日風）致夭亡者甚多、對產後一切處置、及嬰孩之保陣、又毫無辦法、故產母時有發生「產褥熱」之可能、李局長以滬地尤多、長此以往、後患不堪設想、乃於昨日特令滬南區衛生事務所所長尤濟華辦理婦嬰衛生、使避免婦嬰之犧牲而得以安全、</p>
<p>舉行產婦登記</p>
<p>市衛生局爲保障產婦及胎位安全起見、將在南市林蔭路滬南區衛生事務所內、舉行產婦登記、並擬定章程及各種表格、凡產婦懷孕五個月以上者、均可前往該所領取登記表格、塡就後送所備案、當有專員指導飮食起居規定、與姙娠之攝生法、並定期檢查胎位有否異狀、同時對於產婦日常動作等、均有相當之糾正、據滬南區衛生事務所長尤濟華語國民社記者、對於辦理婦嬰衛生、擬與南市上海公立醫院合作進行、惟舉行產婦登記手續、正在籌備一切表格、大約出月即可實行、</p>
<p>防止假名詐欺</p>

<p>公共租界老虎車及塌車二業、自工部局决定增加執照費以來、屢提抗議、表示反對、工部局財政委員會曾將此事、一再考應、最近已决定該次執照費、暫緩增加、惟對於此種人力推挽之各種小車、在交通上之地位、尙須加以精確之調查、以定將來之方針、聞工部局董事曾對於該委員會之建議、已予採納矣、</p>
<p>查此次老虎車及塌車二業之加捐、係根據於本年春季、西僑納稅人年會所通過之工部局各項捐稅執照費定額、幷應自本年七月一日起施行、嗣據同業陳請收回成命、顧念商艱、幷經納稅華人會之代爲請命、工部局遂有緩加之議、惟此次捐稅之增加、本不全爲財政着想、查所謂老虎車者、本係碼頭運貨小車、專用於碼頭貨棧及車站之問、載重以五百磅爲限、但日久弊生、此等小車、今已佈滿全市之街道、且載重逾限、時有多至千磅左右者、於是行經馬路之時、時將路面切壞、此事在工部局方面、歷經各部負責人討論之後、遂有增加執照費、以資限制之議、幷在執照上規定載重不得過三百磅、現增加執照費之舉、旣以同業之反對、而不得不從緩、但此種車輛在交通上之地位、頗有討論之餘地、據財政委員會討論時所發表之意見、一方旣須將現有車輛執照之數目加以限制、一方面必須另覓他法以資取締、幷有建議老虎車應裝橡皮輪者、亦有謂老虎車卽裝橡皮輪之後、局方可將執照費之三分之一退回以示優待者、惟車主方面、是否有此財力、尙屬疑問、結果除增加執照費暫緩置議之外、其關乎交通問題、俟調查詳確之後、再予討論、</p>
<p>新聲社云、老虎車塌車加捐事、經工部局委員會决議、暫緩加捐後、昨日董事會開會通過暫緩增加執照費、委員會並建議董事會、對現在數量加以限制、藉以取締、號主張老虎車改裝橡皮車胎、以護路面、車戶裝橡皮輪後、所有捐額、减收三分之一、載重以五百磅爲限、昨經董事會討論、决先調查車輛總數之後、再行討論、兩業互助會、定今日下午二時、在新世界原址舉行成立大會、</p>

<p>記者遊靑島，參觀第四屆鐵展會，各館出品，極爲豐富，深喜中國前途有無窮之希望。繼遊售品所，則門前冷落，不復如前屆北平之景象，始嘆目下人民購買力之薄弱出於意外，而處處受人束縛牽制，又覺啼笑無從，痛心曷極！人生不幸而生斯世，卽「提倡國貨」之聲浪，亦且有人扼其吭，而不令聲張，云胡不慟。顧事勢至此，無他道，只有大家咬緊牙關，努力苦幹，必有吐氣揚眉之一日。今後無論製造之工廠，販賣之店舖，對於國貨間題，只有實地幹去，吾們老百姓，只有跟着他們跑，做到那裏便那裏，不必急急求近功，也不必滔滔談不絕，所謂咬緊牙關和血呑，拚命爭氣而已。</p>
<p>今後國貨工業家之自處，在這極度艱窘時代，不必過分悲觀，一味消極，也不必虛驕之氣，掉以輕心。凡一切的一切，只有做到「飲泣銜哀」，靜待天日之重臨，小小挫折，不必灰心，種種艱難困苦，未始不是老天玉汝於成。尤其要緊的，要知彼知己，欲知彼，先知己，知己之短，然後可以有爲，知人之長，然後可以取法。國貨界之生路，卽在此處。</p>

<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>我們檢視近年來國貨運動的趨勢，已漸由理論而到實踐的階段，許多人正在埋頭苦幹中努力前進，那確是挽救當前我國經濟危機一個好的現象，而前天，我更見報載，本市市商會所發起，聯合工商界組織的「工商業復興委員會」，業已正式成立，並發表宣言和工作稈序，可更使我們十二分地相信，在產業危機這樣急迫的現象下，有該侖的產生，對於發展國貨的前途，實有着最大的意義，因爲我國工業界過去在工業管理，和生產技術上的忽略，無疑義的是一個阻礙整個事業進展的主因，而目下該會正標舉着如何謀改良工業技術和經營方法，確是將給與工商界一個復興與進展的新生機。</p>
<p>大家知道，我國本爲一生產落後的國家，所以，工業組織，經營方法，和生產技術，一切都不能和外人相頡頏，而產業的進行，也遭受了莫大的困難，但是，在這裏，我們千萬不要自餒，要知道，我國現下的生產率和消費率，尙祗有二與五之比，所以，那新興工業的產生，機製物品的去適應大衆需要，那正是有着歷史條件的促動，我們只要認定過去中國工業旣在組織和技術上面吃了虧，今後就從這裏去謀改良工業技術與販賣方法，並調查各業衰敗的主因，而給以對症良藥，這種科學的態度，工商界自覺的表現，正是十二今良好和正確的現象。</p>
<p>不過，在該會創立伊始的時候，以我個人的意見，尙有幾個値得討論的實際問題，要提出來加以研討並希望大衆注意，那就是第一望該會能愈益擴大和健全本身的組織，聘任各業的領袖，或富有學識及經騐的人才，共同研究，謀今後工商界的開拓，以資勝任此項繁重的任務，第二要詳細的調查世界各工業先進國家的工業概况，分別參考其對於某業的組織與技術，草成一個適應本國的改良的標準計劃，以備今後各業的去改革和實踐，第三於調查後，務須將已成的研究所得及設計改善的方法，以積極的態度，儘量爲各業指導，切實做去。這樣，我想整個工商界的不景氣，一定可由幾瀕破產的深淵中，轉向光明的正軌前進。</p>
<h3 id="c209">合理化的夏令用品 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>時代的雙輪，依着了時序的軌道，一些也不偸懶的過去，現在，已是火傘高張，熱浪襲來的夏季了。在夏季裏，我們對於一切用的，吃的，穿的東西，自然也和別的時季不同，有一些兒小小的轉變，明白些說，人們對於夏季的用品，是的確很費斟酌的一件事，怎樣購用合理化的夏令用品，便成爲一個値得討論的問題。關於這個問題，本刋似乎有人談過，不過在我看來，還覺得略而不詳，現在，把這個怎樣才是合理化的夏令用品的問題，依照我的見解，發表一些簡單的意見在下面：</p>
<p>第一，我覺得合理化的夏令用品，自然應該是採用國貨的，我們旣是中國人，就應該購用中國貨，不論牠是冬季，或是夏季，我們一年到頭，三百六十五天之中，我們的生活需要，應該購用國貨的東西，這樣，國貨事業，才會發達，國貨運動，才會成功，國民經濟，才侖寬裕，農村破產，方能救濟，當此夏令，我們的用品，自然較之他季爲多，我誠懇的勸吿購用夏令用品的同胞們，請牢牢的記着「國貨」兩字，那末，定能挽回不少的利權，於國計民生，實有很大的關係。</p>
<p>第二，我覺得合理化的夏令用品，應該是堅牢的，誰都知道，堅牢的用品，和不堅牢的用品，比較起來，其中的相差，是很大的，有的人購買了一伴汗衫，可以穿上三個夏季，然而，有的人購買的汗衫，只能穿一個夏季，這其間的分別，那個便宜？那個吃虧？是不言可喩的，所以，我們購　夏令用品，應該到著名的國貨工廠去購買，譬如毛巾被，我們應該到三友實業社去買，汗衫，我們應該到五和或景綸去買，草帽，我們應該到華福振興去買，這種常識，我們是不可缺少的，因爲著名的國貨工廠的出品，他的價錢，表面上似乎稍爲貴些，但是，買來之後，比普通的能够耐用不少時候，這種內在的便宜，我們是應該明白的。</p>
<p>第三，我要說到夏令的飮料了，在夏季裏，人們對於飮料的消耗，也是很大的，但是有的人喜歡吃外國飮料，這是很可痛心的一伴事。要知道現在咱們中國的飮料事業，比從前是突飛猛進了，如冠生園，家庭工業社，泰康罐頭公司的果子露，益利的汽水，生生的牛乳，冰淇淋等等，其製造之淸潔衛生，和外國貨究竟有什麽不及的地方呢？所以，我在這裏，可要誠懇的勸吿一般同胞，我們對於夏季的飮料，還是採用自己國貨的好，須知吃了外國的飮料，心中總有一些兒不安，吃了中國飮料，利權不致外溢，精神上是如何的心安理得呢？</p>
<p>上而的三點小意見，是我對於購用夏令用品的同胞們的貢獻，不知道區區之意，能得到若干的同情嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c210">提倡國貨是賢內助的責任 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>自從結婚以後，我的老友楊君大大的改變過來了。他這一變，總算是難得的，然而全是由於他的夫人劉女士的軟硬工夫表演得有勁，有以致之也。</p>
<p>楊君今年二十八歲，在交通機關裏服務，月入　優。方於本年三月完婚，劉女士是崇德女學高材生，二十二歲。楊君以前原是一個西裝友，服飾摩登，舉凡身上所需各物，差不多都選用舶來品，上至頭上的呢帽草帽及頭水司丹康，下至花襪皮鞋，一律十足的來路貨，以爲國貨是不能滿人意的。但自從結婚以後，他幷不添置西裝了，這夏季裏，倒穿起華絲紗和小舫的長衫及短衣褲，鞋是穿的紗鞋，白襪子，國貨草帽。我初次看見他時，當眞認不得他，我自從相識他以來，不曾見他着過中式衣服。他此時丰度翩翩，斯文溫雅，比穿西裝時更爲好看，然而我終於問他：「啊唷！阿楊！怎麽的了？你也改起花樣來了！」。</p>
<p>「其實中國衫着起來舒服得多！而且又凉快得很。」</p>
<p>「但是你改着中式衣服的動機何在呢？」我問着。</p>
<p>「是愛國！」他面孔有點紅了，「我的女人定要我改着中裝，說這樣可以提倡國貨。她還叫我以後勿再置備西裝，說我着西裝不大好看，而且原料多從外國來，給人家賺了我們的錢去。」</p>
<p>「她倒是愛國的，但是她自已着什麼布呢？」</p>
<p>「完全是中國布料。什麽漂亮的外國紗，她都反對購用。不但衣服是如此，連化妝品也不買外國的。「白衣人」頭水，「四七一一」香水，「三花牌」面粉胭脂，她都不用，只買價廉物美的國貨。」</p>
<p>「這便是了。尊夫人到底比你明白一點。」</p>
<p>「明白是明白的，只是也太過精細，一樣東西在她，裏，她就要問是不是中國貨，像個檢查委員。家裏用的東西，限定我買中國貨，如其是外國貨，不得入房門，晚上也要我拿去退換，幷無商量餘地的。現在家裏應用各物，我已經由她全權辦理了。」</p>
<p>此我曾到他家裏坐過幾回，除了楊君舊日買下來一個外國衣櫳？和十幾套西裝，兩雙舊外國皮鞋，一個雨衣，一隻梵阿林之外，尋不出別樣洋貨來。我着實稱讚了楊夫人幾句，她還請我飮了一瓶國貨汽水。</p>
<p>我對於楊夫人，眞是越想越佩服，在這虛榮心特重的上海灘浪，女子們，（尤其有知識的女子們），什九趨慕洋化，做着得力的洋貨服用者。而楊夫人力矯此弊，以身作則，感化了她的丈夫，盡了一點國民的天職，眞是一個百分之百的賢內助！</p>
<p>我寫這篇槁子，是得着楊君伉儷的同意的。我願許多爲人妻者，各出良方奇計，感化那些洋化了的丈夫。如果自己也是愛用洋貨的，便馬上覺醒過來，以楊夫人爲模範，什麼都非國貨，不准帶入家門。假如大家眞能照此實行起來，中國國貨界纔有救星，中國經濟的危機纔能避免。從今日起，願許多婦女們立定主意做一個知時識務的賢內助！</p>

<p>— 無涯</p>
<p>假使你注意市上所售的搪瓷器的商標，你一定會看見那些和西洋貨不相上下的立鶴牌瓷器。因爲牠價廉物美，確實替國貨界爭過不少光的。所們就約了五個朋友去參觀「立鶴牌瓷器」製造所＿中華琺瑯廠。由一個王君領導，給我們解釋得很淸楚。</p>
<p>我們最先走進製坯工塲，這是最初工作的塲所，把鐵皮在切坯機上製成種種模型的坯。還有酸洗間和生燒間各一，把這坯用稀酸洗刷過再在生燒處煉過。</p>
<p>製粉工場又可分開五處，這是專做琺瑯粉的。第一處，把整塊的石塊，放在滾動機內滾成細粉。第二處，就由技師把各種原料配成功所需要的材料。第三處，就是把配合的細粉，放在窰內鍜燒，但是恐怕鍛燒過的細粉有凝固的發生於是再在第四處和水間，加以和水。第五處便是貯藏的地方。我們又到工廠裏去參觀，有好多工人都用稀酸把坯洗爭後，其次，在坯上塗一層黏性的物質，再加一層琺瑯瓷，於是放在火裏鍜燒如是者三次，待鍜燒出了後，再在美術工場去加花，這是用各種顏色塗的，使得引起顧客愛美的心理。加花有三種方法：（一）貼花，（二）噴花，（三）油繪。總之，都是用科學方法做成的。加了花後，再經過一次鍜燒。於是便可以包裝了。但是，據王君說，他們還須嚴密的檢奄而才問世的。我們知道，粗製濫造，是走入滅亡的途中去，努力於國貨的工廠，是不會這樣的。</p>
<p>他們的原料，採自國產的已很多，像硫酸，蘇打灰，長石的。不過，有幾種，像鐵皮，養化鈷等，還須靠自英美等國，這一點，須政府注意及之！</p>
<p>該廠有工人約三百餘人，都很勤謹地工作。足見平時對於工人訓練有很大的注意的。當我走出了中華琺瑯廠的大門，我心裏充滿着快樂，王君最後的一句話還留在我的耳朶邊：「民國五年的時候，外國搪瓷器輸華，每年總數約達五百萬元以上，現在，差不多完全用國貨了』。</p>

<p>國貨龍虎牌人丹，大家已有很深的印象了！記得二十年之前，市上風行的，只見「仁丹」和「金剛石」牙粉，金剛石已被家庭工業社的「無敵牌」起而代之，如今國貨人丹，已風行了二十載了，這藥中小小的起死回生品，倘統計歷年挽回漏巵的金額，想來着實可驚呢！</p>
<p>人丹的銷路所以發達！國貨的所以被同胞樂用，就是「人丹」產母中法藥房，爲朝野合力的事業，利人利己的企業，如以太極拳著名的褚民誼氏之提倡，及許曉初先生等爲業務努力！褚氏的「龍」「虎」精神！尤爲衆所欽仰！「人丹」的二十週年紀念，豈倖致哉？</p>
<p>妙乎！女體育家陸禮華女士的演詞「辦體育學校的宗旨，是養成生「龍」活「虎」般的國民，一旦有了小毛病，卽應以「龍虎牌」人丹治之……」雖不免有些矛盾，但鍜鍊成就龍虎般的體魄，也難保不會發生些小毛病，卽景成文，可謂「善於措詞」了！其次，該藥房「努力商戰」的歌曲，很値得介紹給國入，錄之以殿吾文，</p>
<p>「同志們，大家起來，祖負起國貨的提倡，看吧！滿目是國貨的創傷！聽吧！外貨入超數的驚浪！我們是要選擇「戰」，還是「降」？</p>
<p>我們要產銷合作，决勝在商塲，我們是要積極的努力着幹上，「龍虎人丹」算是個榜樣，廿年奮鬥頑抗强項，今天招待諸君，聚集一堂，請協力唤醒民族，自救！宣揚……不斷地進長。</p>
<p>同志們！同志們！快拿出力量來担負起國貨的提倡。</p>

<p>— 冰魂</p>
<p>關於飮料的問題，本刊上曾有幾次的討論；的確，在這炎熱的夏天，飮料差不多是人人需要的，因爲它的銷路浩大，所以値得我人注意。</p>
<p>記得有位先生說：「喝外國貨的飮料，就是喝本國人的鮮血」。這話雖然說得刺激了一些，但是各種外貨飮料充斥市上，每年從這一項上有億萬金錢流到外國人的手裏，這能使我們不痛心嗎？</p>
<p>平心而論，如果國人能够飮水思源，不再購用外貨飮料，那麼國貨飮料也儘可以供給國人飮用，我現在可以介紹一種國貨飲料，就是五洲藥房的菜子露，這種出品很淸潔，配以冷開水冲飮，止渴解熱；並且一瓶可作多次分飮，比較更是經濟呀。</p>
<p>來函　編者先生：拙作「改良粗紙」一篇，承刋於七月十八日國貨週刋，頗爲素業草紙者注意。惟方程式之符號排錯，加法誤爲乘法，致來疑問，茲乞史正</p>
<p>如左：</p>
<p>第一式原稿係　譯文爲鉀二，炭養，炭養三，輕二養加鈣養等於鈣炭養三加兩份鉀養輕（卽苛性鉀）</p>
<p>第二式原稿係　譯文爲鈣（養輕）二，加兩份鈉綠等於鈣綠二，加兩份鈉養輕（卽苛性鈉）</p>
<p>來函問詢者，對於第二式謂不可能，但在事實上則食鹽淌中尙含有鎂綠二，及鎂硫養四，在苛性鉀溶液中極易分解，其綠爲苛性鉀所吸誘，遂起游離而成電解中伊洪，故煮料必經加熱，正與電解之理同也。</p>
<p>又「若以竹篩濾之成餅」句上擬加註云（如稻草價昂，每百斤加一角時，每噸但加五元可矣，如用別物，亦同此例。）蓋因各地原料價格不同，來函有謂不可能者，其實草價至多不過加昂二角，是每噸亦祇三十四元而已，是不爲也，非不能也，我國工業之不振，卽由原料居奇之故，良可　耳！天虛我生敬上。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「這是那裏　　我　　實有些不能相信，我委實有些不能相信。」父親老是這樣的感嘆着，說過了再說，說過了再說，不知道說了幾十遍。</p>
<p>便是太后也一般覺得這是非常難信之事！伊怱怱地把那些文卷看完之後，便像閑談一般的和慶親王評論起來：其時我正側着耳朶傾聽着，居然就一字不漏的聽明白了。</p>
<p>「我們無論如何也不能明白，」伊說道：「像××那樣的一個人，出身旣然非常的高貴，而且賴着他祖宗的庇陰，所交往的無一不是王公貴戚，地位是不能再高的了；再加朝廷又如此的信賴他，把全省的軍民的交在他一人的手內，不料他竟會做出這麼許多醜事來？這眞是很難信的！我不相信像他那樣一個人，如其有了一副淸爽的頭腦，又把良心放在中間，再會幹出何種不名譽的壞事來；顯然是他的頭腦太糊塗，良心又不放在中間，才會有此結果！」</p>
<p>太后所說的良心放在中問，用近代人的語氣解釋起來，就是第一要忠誠，第二要正直，第三要値得信託，第四就要對待無論那一個人都有一種慈祥和仁愛的態度。</p>
<p>接着，太后就特別提出他縱容家丁，鞭打乞丐致死的一條罪狀來討論。（三七四）</p>

<h3 id="c220">自認地震國的日本 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>住在日本不到半載，而已逢着一二十多回地震，又因了前月　灣大地震，於是日本居民無不惴惴自危，憂　大禍將臨。日本有偉大的軍備，但絕對不能阻止地震。還有無數高明的科學家，埋頭研究，亦未有預報及防止的良業。報紙上說「日本是有名的地震國，每月微震三四次，是應有的現象。六月中雖已震了六次，但一般觀察並無意外危險，居民不必憂慮。」這種不着痛癢的話，如何能减低人民的恣懼。因爲事實上淺間山噴烟，至今未熄啊。</p>
<p>初到日本很想嘗一次地震的滋味，試騐地震時究竟怎樣感覺。因為在國內自出世以來，竟沒有逢着地震過。機會忽然來了，當台灣大地震的一天，是淸晨一二時左右，被地震驚醒了。房屋搖動得很利害，格格作響，好像要倒下來的樣子。身體上下左右顫動，如坐列車中。同時頭腦微暈，又像暈船。想起身避難，但是外面鳥雀無聲，又只好忍耐着。到天明見報載東京微震，便嚇了一驚。此種在中國絕無僅有的地震，在日本却不算一回事，用不着大驚小怪。於此可見强震的時光，一定很可怕了。</p>
<p>輕微的地震，已使我們枕蓆不安，我不希望再嘗試較强的地震了。在博物館裏看到地震時的火車頭，燒成幾根鐵棒。鐵器玻璃。熔成塊狀，倘然是人類，一定要飛骨揚灰，毫無蹤跡。但是經了幾次的地震，却增進了些科學經騐。覺得地震的振動，也和波紋一樣，有規則的由中凡點（震央）向四周擴張出去。成爲圓形。離中心點愈遠，影響　弱，以至消滅。並且此種環狀振波，忽强忽弱，又和聲浪相同。所以地震一次，中間可以分若干次。圾多時候，我逢着十分鐘中動六七次。</p>
<p>地震火山多的地方，地殼較薄，所以不能建築高大的洋房，日本泥質又鬆，街上的電車汽車通行，便要使兩旁房屋土地震動。全國最高的房屋九層，國家限制不能冉高，以避危險。於是只得向地下發展，大凡較大的建築，都有地下室，作爲公衆食堂。最近丸之內（街名）某公司，在建築七層高的房屋。用壓榨空氣，注入地底，以使地盤鞏固。那知附近人家的地上，都噴出臭氣來。後來發現某公司所注入地下的空氣，因爲地土太鬆，便向四處噴出。帶了地下的雜質，於是成爲微毒的臭氣。經了四鄰反對，建築因此中止。日本人對於任何事情，都要和歐美爭勝，獨有建築物是爭不出氣來，他們時常羨慕上海，能造二三十層的房屋。</p>
<p>普通的房屋，十分之九是木材。牆壁裏並無磚頭，只用木條釘着，外面塗些灰沙或是水泥。所以外觀是很美麗的人造石，裏面却是泥沙草包。房子裏更無牆壁和隔板，都用糊布的薄門隔着，窗架門戶，都向兩旁移動。細巧的木條，用些氣力，即可破壞。屋外的圍牆，也大都是木板。所以一有火警，很易燃燒。幸而日本對消防很注意，人民家裏，大都有滅火藥水，所以連焚數十家的事情不多。</p>
<p>因爲時常地震的關係，屋頂上的磚瓦，只有一曆，而且很薄。最近盛行洋鉛，重量更可减輕。他們的房屋，和基地並不相連，礎石上面再置木架，房屋便建在木架上。倘然上面用起重機吊起，可以任意移動史換方向。我們在上海住在亭子間裏，時常要怨天怨地，那知日本的房屋盡是鳥籠一樣。因爲住的問題，常受地震危險，於是不得不求國外進展，這也是一個重要的原因。</p>

<h3 id="c221">論「評書與評人」 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>看了「自由談」上另境先生的文章「評書與評人」：「只要評者（顯露他的所知道的作者多於書中所能告訴他的，他的貶責卽刻成為攻擊，他的譏刺就會成為侮辱。」我頗不以為然。另境先生想這話是頗為「正確」，在下看來，却並不很正確。另境先生以為「作家寫一篇文章或看一本書，他所應負的責任，正確地說只有這文這書的本身，無論作者平日的生活如何狂嫖亂賭卑鄙下流，批評家只應從書本里去找「有毒」或「有益」，至於作者的行為是用不到批評家去費心的，社會道德和國家法律自然會加以制裁的。」光景另境先生是贊成「因文論文」而不贊成「因人論文」和「因文論人」的。可是事實上這麼簡單的事怕不會有，在現在我們就很可以看到一帮「心同商賈」的自命清高的山人以及「翩然一隻雲間鶴，飛來飛去宰相衙，」遍處「打秋風」的名士，而他們一開口，一提筆也還總是「狂放不羈」「放逸」「瀟洒」對現實大發議論，痛罵一切的卑污齷龊，彷彿這世界就祗有他一個人是「清高」似的。在社會或「文學圈」內，我們不是也很經常碰到一把燕尾服裹上梅毒第二期的身子，便煞有介事地痛責人們之嫖妓的紳士麼？這時候批評者就不得不「因人論人」或「因人論文」，把他的衣服剝個精光，讓看官們看看他究竟是個什麼東西。因為假如你這時候還客客氣氣地來給他「因文論文」，那就上了他的大當，說不定他還也會暗地里笑你一聲「阿墨林」的。這就是在現在為人還不可太忠厚，而「待人以誠」還須視對方之態度而定的緣故。而且現在「二重人格」的人們也實在太多，「言」「行」對照乃成為不可少的武器，因此「因文論人」以至於「因人論文」也就是時常免不了的。不久的先前，我們不是碰到了那些養尊處優京派名士，却罵賣文為活的人，「人品不高，文格不高」。這時候，他待你並不「誠」，而你却死要對他「誠」，結果總是自己喫虧；結果呢，不但要待之以誠而不可得，並且要不待之以诚也不可得了。所以講到「待人以誠」，最好還是看清對手，假如是一些還不配以「誠」待之的，那就大家也就無須乎打拱作揖，客客氣氣；待到他也是以「誠」待人了，然後再跟他待他以「誠」不遲。總而言之，不能一味「誠」下去。在這一點上，我是贊成「卽以其人之道，治其人之身」的。</p>

<p>— 齊吾文</p>
<p>偶然的機緣，我又在北方兜了一個大圈子。就北方三條路的車輪講，北寗車三等車廂的確是跟　海或平漢有點不同；那裏裝的滿是過着非人生活的「下流人」——齷龊的農人和樸實的小商人；而這兒已有好些「上流社會」的人物點綴着，并且還有日本和高麗人的臉孔穿插其間，所以連靠椅的長度和椅背的高度都像樣。拿我的周圍來說吧：在身旁的就是一個作中國時裝打扮的扁臉的高麗的女人，坐在我對面的，是個穿洋服的中年男子，從他的魁梧的身軀，稜嶒的顴骨，和生硬的北方話，知道他也是高麗人；其他一個才是中國人，——一個二十多歲的青年女子。當我進站的時候，她正在我後邊跑着，趕上前向我打聽××飯店是在天津甚麼租界。她的臉瘦削而帶著貧血症所賦與的顏色，深眶而灰暗的眼睛，刻有傷痕的鼻梁，隱示她是一個經過憂思的早熟的女子，她的裝束是普通學生的裝束——格布的旗袍上穿着一件陳舊的雨衣，濺着泥污點的短襪和寬頭的平底皮鞋。除了一個手提的軟的小藤籃子外，她沒有帶甚麼。</p>
<p>我們坐定後，她繼續的向我打聽應該在老站還是在新站下車。跟着她自動地向我解釋她上天津到旅館去的原因：</p>
<p>『我到天津是找我的哥哥去的，我哥跟我嫂打架了，負氣離開家裏，我的父親又沒有空，我只好跑一趟。』她的口音是典型的北平女學生的口音，說得很快，說話時，面部的筋肉和嘴使勁的動，表情得有點過分了。</p>
<p>我除了問了她一句，為甚麼會知道她的哥哥所在之外，只唔唔的答應她。</p>
<p>『他的朋友打電報給我們的。』她聽見我說話帶有南方口音，她便問我是那兒的人。我告訴了她之後不好意思不回問『府上那兒』了。她滔滔的告訴我她是江西人，可是在北京住了多年了，父親在京裏社會局做事，上海也曾「待」過好些日子，天津只去過一次。隨後她便由南北方言異同的問題扯到北方比南方人　髒一類的問題。</p>
<p>在國內你也碰見過這樣的青年女性——見着陌生人也開話匣子的青年女性，我還是第一次。我雖然沒有向她刨根究底，但，我沒有討厭她；我只覺得她有點異樣，但同時覺得她是出自然，在她的面前，我慚愧自己竟現出女性的羞澀和不自然了。可是她沒有注意這一層，還是間歇地跟我談話。——是的，她也曾向我身邊坐着的朝鮮女人搭訕過，但因為她不懂中國話的緣故，只好單找我說話了。</p>
<p>當一個賣香烟糖果的小販走過時，她向他買了一包「紅錫包，」從籃裏摸索了好一會才掏出兩毛錢給他。她首先遞烟讓我吃，我再三的推說不會吃。</p>
<p>『我以為你吸烟，我才買的，我自己也不抽烟，』可是她後來自己也抽了好幾根。</p>

<p>— 葉紫</p>
<p>六十三歲的母親，生肺病的老婆，和兩個營養不良的孱弱的孩子，被饑餓，水災和一些無情地環境的威脅，從三千多里路的故鄕，狼狽地逃亡出來，想依靠我這一月有十多元稿費收入的兒子，丈夫和父親過活。</p>
<p>一到岸，就是忙着訴說故鄕的艱苦的情形和吃藥。</p>
<p>因為還有一個姊姊帶着四五個孩子留在故鄕，母親總是帶着對於自己的飄流生活頗為滿足的神情嘆着氣說：</p>
<p>『我們還好呢！雖然苦，合家都團圓了！……祗有你姊姊，不知道她們的垸子倒潰沒有？那樣的不能活命的一家喲！……她是早該來信了的……』</p>
<p>彎着乾枯的手指，算着：六天，八天……眼淚背着我們夫婦不知道偷偷地流了多少——懸望着那一封平安的來信。</p>
<p>在一個大雨的早晨，母親為老婆的沉重的咳嗽和呼痛聲敬了一個通宵的菩薩，睡著了。郵差從後門遞上一封欠資的信件來，我付完了他八分郵票的銅元，躱在灶披間里急急忙忙地拆開來看。</p>
<p>字跡模糊，信壳和信紙都是用草紙做成的。還不曾看我就知道內容給一定不妙。字，不是墨筆寫的也不是鉛筆寫的，也許是用燒焦了的小樹枝寫的吧。我記得兒童時代曾同姊姊玩過用小樹枝燒焦寫字的把戲，大約她還不曾忘記，臨時做來應用了。</p>
<p>我的手發着抖，看着信還要耽心着母親和老婆醒來。孩子已經哭起來了，我將她抱到我的身邊，拿了一雙筷子給她玩。我讀着信，孩子用筷子敲着臉盆，並且唱着一種從故鄕帶來的饑民們流行的討飯曲。</p>
<p>垸子，當然是倒潰了。姊姊的信，是伏在荒山中的一個石頭上寫的。她說：</p>
<p>『…那一晚，黑暗無光，大雨將屋頂都幾乎打穿了。你姊夫被鑼聲呌出去搶險，我同五個孩子偎在堂屋中間，戰顫地等著擋堤的人們的好消息……通宵不睡的不祗我們一家，可是他們，都焚着香，敲着罄，哭聲地喊天求菩薩！……狗和畜生都號呌起來了，好像知道有大禍臨頭似的到處找尋他們的安身處。……我儘量地制止孩子們不哭！可是鑼聲和雨聲越來越緊……剛剛天亮的時候，突然地，不知道是那一方天崩地裂一聲，大水就排山倒海湧進我們的禾田和堂屋中來了……</p>
<p>『我不知道用什麼話來告訴我們的苦况，總之，那個時候，我一看見水，就同見了催命的無常鬼似的，大聲的哭呌起來了！孩子們都纏着我的身子，我不能跑出頭門去求救，並且也沒有人肯來救我們！你姊夫也不能回來……水一下子就高齊了板櫈！……我將孩子們一個一個地送到板樓上。我們的板樓你知道，祗有二塊板子的。……正午，水封了我們的門，並且板樓上也平水了，我就祗能將屋頂挖開，將孩子們送到屋頂上！……</p>
<p>『雨仍然很大，我們沒有什麼東西遮攔淋着，並且刮着狂風，浪頭有時高齊我們的屋頂。我們的濕身子一直又等到太陽出來才曬乾，曬得發昏，曬得發痛！……我們在屋頂上整整地挨了三天！……到第四天早晨，才看見你姊夫搖　一隻破划船來。……孩子們，最小的一個死在我的懷抱裏，別的一個——第三的——俊襄，不知道在夜間的什麼時候，被浪濤捲到水中去了！也許是他自己餓昏了滾到水中去的，連一些兒聲息都沒有！……</p>
<p>『現在，弟弟！我不想再來訴說我的苦况。總之，一切你都想象得到的，你也曾經過不少次數的大水災。……我們現在是被運送到這荒山上來了，這裏滿山都是災民。也許他們中間還有比我們更苦的吧！他們整天地盼望着賑災的老爺們從天上飛來。可是我，什麼希望都是死滅的，因為我經過水災的次數太多了，雖然這一次比無論那一次都厲害！……</p>
<p>『你姊夫已經五六天不沾水米了，渾身火熱！可是他對我說：「你去吧！帶着小的兩個孩子，討飯討到上海去！你讀了書，認識字，也許你的弟弟能替你想一點辦法的！……大的孩子留給我，我祗要病好一點就能捉魚！……」弟弟啊，我拿什麼話來回答他呢？我知道。你自己也許會沒有辦法的！母親，病着的弟婦和兩個孩子，你又沒有職業。並且，我們討飯又是不許出境的……』</p>
<p>我讀著信，我的鼻子一陣陣地發酸，可是我不能極力地忍着不流眼淚。老婆的咳嗽聲沉重起來了，我挾着孩子走上樓去，母親已經又爬起來替老婆在倒開水。她一看見我就問：</p>
<p>『是信嗎？你在下面看的…』</p>
<p>『是的！』我說。我不能掩飾地將信放在檯子上；我欺她不識字，態度安詳地說：『是姊姊來的好消息。她們的垸子沒有潰倒！』</p>
<p>『好消息嗎？阿彌陀佛！…皇天不負苦心人！』母親合掌地說，『念呀！念給我聽呀！一個一個字地念下去！』</p>
<p>我硬着嗓子念着，我覺得我的眼裏看見的不是草紙做成的信紙，而是一片汪洋，一大堆一大堆地災民的屍骨！那裏面有有我的姊姊，甥兒，甚至於連我自己！而我的嘴裏念出來的，却是一個完全相反的，豐登的，夢想不到的世界。我說：</p>
<p>『她說：「你要母親千萬不要着急，多虧官民同心協力的搶救，我們的垸堤沒有潰倒！……現在早稻已經黃熟了，我收穫得比任何年都多。孩子們也都十分健壯」……』</p>
<p>『真好啊！』母親微笑了。</p>
<p>下午，我便偷偷地寫了一封回信，說了好些不能搔着痛癢的，空洞的，安慰的話，將借來給老婆吃藥的最後三元錢買了匯票。</p>
<p>『也許她們會收不到我這三元錢的！』走出郵局來，我忽然這樣的傷心地想着，眼淚便再也忍不住的流下來了。</p>
<h3 id="c224">嫦娥補考 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 姚雪垠</p>
<p>發表了「中國產日月的女神」以後，病中沒事，打開讀書扎記聞看，見遺漏了好些材料，非常惋惜。其中最重要的有兩條，其一是：常儀變為嫦娥，高誘已經說過。「呂氏春秋審分覽」里有「羲和作占日，尚儀作占月」兩句，高誘注道：</p>
<p>尚儀卽嫦娥，故讀儀為何，后世遂有嫦娥之鄙言。</p>
<p>關於嫦娥奔月的記載，據我所見到的最早的是在「淮南子覽冥訓」里。「淮南子」這部書，出於一羣方士之手，所以嫦娥奔月故事顯然是附會捏造，並非神話。在神話中的月亮，人們早先彷彿只知道兔子或蝦蟆住在上邊，並不知道有一位月奶奶。「天問」中云：</p>
<p>夜光何德，死則又育？厥利維何，而顧菟在腹？</p>
<p>這是一個神話，大概在戰國時流行於荊湘一帶。在墨西哥，Zululald，西藏，都有這類似的故事。「淮南子精神訓」里說：</p>
<p>日中有踆烏，而月中有蟾蜍。</p>
<p>「說林訓」里也有：</p>
<p>月照天下，食於蟾諸。</p>
<p>蟾諸就是蟾蜍。也就是蝦蟆。「呂氏春秋季秋紀」里說：</p>
<p>月也者，羣陰之本也。月望則蚌蛤實，羣陰盈；月晦則蚌蛤虛，羣陰虧。</p>
<p>這個神話同前者大概是由一個分化的。這是把月亮當作一個蚌蛤，月滿是蚌蛤實了，月晦是蚌蛤虛了。</p>
<p>據所引「審分覽」里的兩句，我們又知道羲和在戰國末曾轉變為占日，常儀曾轉變為占月。但羲和又被人當作日御，常儀却不曾被當作月御。月御是一個叫做望舒的神，只見於楚辭，想來也是荊湘間的傳說吧，常儀曾作過占月，這是我在前文所遺漏的材料之二。</p>
<p>其次該補說的是：月的姊妹（或弟兄）是十二個，暗示着這神話發生於十二月劃分清楚之後，所以想來至古不過在殷商時代。</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>花開走過了；現在路底兩旁已經不是榆樹，而是細長高聳的樺樹。再走一段路，我就來到一個凉爽的森林，這林沿着左邊一個山丘直長上去；在另一邊，我穿過樹木已可附瞰海水了。在我前面的最密的林子中有　岛底銀鈴般的歌聲和烏鶴底迷人的呼喚，此外我還聽見樹葉蕭蕭作響和底下海波動蕩音聲，像音樂一樣。我突然想起了一個半舊的屋子，也是在這個森林裏頭。幾年以前我還是第二級生時候，從學校出來去拜訪一個同我有親戚關係的大學生，曾同他一起到那裏去過。據我那時所知道，這屋子是一個做投機生意的酒店主人建築下來的；後來投機失敗了，他又不能吸引很多顧客到這幽靜地點來，祗好把這屋子出賣了。這屋底新主人祗派了一個僕歐來照應這清淡的營業。</p>
<p>我還記得這僕歐是個蒼白面色的長個子；這座單層的建築物是在山丘半腰上高聳的樺樹中間藏着的，現在很明顯地出現在我的腦子中了。我的第一杯格洛克酒還是那時在這屋前部中央小柱廊底下喝的，從這柱廊經過一個雙扇門就到了一個高大而暗晦的大廳，大廳後面是向着樹林開窗的。這時我生了興趣，要去重訪這個幽靜的地點，同時我又擔心這屋子已不存在或者找尋不到了。</p>
<p>我正在這樣想時候，抬起頭來就看見一條窄狹的小路，從大路左邊在樹木中間蜿蜒上去。我站了一會兒，我想起那時也是這樣的，於是慢慢地從這小路走上山去。走了一會，我就看見，在我面前樹葉中間現出一個灰色的斜面屋頂來，慢慢地一個小柱廊底柱頭兩面窗戶底上部我也可以看見了。再走幾步，就有一個寬闊的台階引導我從樹蔭底下走上一個平坦的小廣場去。</p>
<p>這屋子就在森林中間幽靜的陽光底下站在我面前了。好久不見，似乎並沒有甚麼改變。原來淡紅色的粉牆，在靠近地面未曾剝落部分，現在也像那時，全被綠苔佈滿着；木柱裂縫中一樣地　生着褐色的草蕊；現在小柱廊底下半開的雙扇門兩旁仍然各有一隻暗綠色的長凳。——我坐在一個長凳上面，經過樹木空隙處觀看下面的海水，此時正有一隻魚船給陽光照着在海面駛過去。——這裏似乎沒有人居住，甚麼都靜悄悄的；從我背後屋子裏面也沒有一點聲音出來；祗有一隻野蜂嗡嗡地飛了過去，石階旁邊草叢中還有二隻黑色蝴蝶飛翔着。</p>

<h3 id="c226">德國再度排猶 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>德國自希特勒登台，不久卽發生一排猶運動。當時寄居德國的猶太人，曾遭受一重大的壓迫。有的被放逐，有的給拘禁，有的遭侮辱。嗣後國社黨得到相當滿足，這風潮也就平靜下去。</p>
<p>然曾幾何時，猶太人的驚魂甫定，現在德國又作第二次排猶運動。而且形勢的緊張，比之前回的排猶更甚。</p>
<p>今番德國的再度排猶，其風潮普遍於全國。各地發生騷動，已有數起。前日柏林西端電影院，開映一排猶影片，觀客中的猶太人，皆低嘯紛紛離座，致引起暴動。又有國社黨黨軍數人，偶與行路的猶太人，發生衝突，一時素稱富麗的庫夫斯頓達頓街上，喧聲四起，蓋國社黨認該街爲猶太人的中心，遂將猶太人所開商店的玻璃，擊碎多片。同時外埠各地，排猶事件，亦層出不窮。</p>
<p>關於這次德國的排猶，各國輿論，多所指責。但據德國警察總司令達柳奇將軍宣稱，德國排猶運動，甚爲正當。達氏近向報界提出一猶太人犯罪的詳細統計，謂就統計數宇而觀，犯罪之事，以猶太居民爲最高。外國輿論對於德國排猶運動，每每不能諒解。設外人若能明瞭猶太人這種犯罪的統計，恐他們不獨不致爲猶太人左袒，更將注意其本國猶太人的罪過矣。而希氏則云，滋事的猶太人，寄居德國，儼同食毛踐士。而對其居停，竟不知感激。馴至忘其所以，絲毫不知檢查其行爲，是可異也。</p>
<p>噫，猶太人食毛踐土，不知仰答高深，歌功頌德，竟然不知檢點，迭犯刑章，猶太人眞不識時務矣。</p>

<p>「施小姐，今天的溫度怎麽啦？」求生的慾望是多麼的急切！</p>
<p>「已經好得多了。—但現在需要充分地休息，使腦神經平靜下來；晚上，千萬別胡思亂想吧。」話說過之後，接着把量溫度的玻璃管裝進盒子裏去，帶着微微的笑意走出了房門。</p>
<p>房子裏的空氣，彷彿修道院似的，靜穆穆的，就連脈搏卜卜的跳動，都隱飛地可以聽出來。</p>
<p>週遭的虫聲，在牆根下啾啾唧唧地歌唱着，月亮從窗口瀉進來，銀樣的光輝，格外的明徹，潔凈。她的如練的銀光，把整個的房子都浸透了，一直浸潤到躺在床上的我的心的深處，也都像月亮般的皎潔明凈起來。這岑寂靜謐的情境，對於病人簡直像慈母的慰藉，把一顆不安定的心，撫摸得像峯巒繚繞的深山裏的靜水湖的湖水，平靜得沒有些兒漣漪的微波。</p>
<p>我平躺在床上痴望着粉白的牆壁上的銀白色的月影迂慢地爬着，這時，我一點也不覺得悒鬱和寂寞，心反而覺得豁然雪　。　事浮雲，所謂富貴，功名，對於人生，原不過是一朶縹渺的烟雲又何値得去留戀，在混濁的人　中去鈎心鬥角的爭取？我深深地慶幸這次的害了這塲不大不小的病症，使我的心可以摒棄一切的煩忙而平息下來，在這岑寂靜謐的環境中，閉着眼睛，平着心氣，悠閒地回味一些過去的陳蹟了。</p>
<p>其實，一個人在沈沈的病中是不會老是那末傻瓜地去想那些烟雲般的撈什子的功名利祿的，因爲他已一步步地走上死的境界，和幽靈只隔一個關門，隨時都有進去的可能。這時，他的心田裏是最明達平靜的，對於過去的一些事情，迥想起來，暗地裏自然會覺得可笑和愚蠢。倘使這時有人把功名利祿都擺到他的床邊來，要他拚着死命起來爭奪，那他未必有着這麼大的勇氣；而這時留賸在他的心坎裏，那恐怕只有强烈的急切的求生的慾望吧了。</p>
<p>我年前，當我在南國—暹羅—的時候，也因爲害了一塲病，進入皇家的朱拉隆功醫院去療養，每當太陽收歛了它的灼辣的光輝，鹹蛋黃似的枕在西邊的林梢上的時候，悠閒地拖着輕鬆的步伐到碧草如茵的庭園裏去，坐在傘蓋似的榕樹底下的椅子上，漫不經意地欣賞着佛「越」（寺院）的燦爛閃爍的尖頂上的黃金色的餘暉，和藍天裏一朶朵燒紅的晚霞，和陣陣吱吱喳喳歸巢的小烏。那時我在庭園裏時常碰到一個皮膚棕黑，身體結實，年紀約莫二四十歲的中年人，手裏拖着手杖，在草地上團團的打圈子，蠻英武的，看起來眞不像一個病人。不久，這兩個孤寂的病人，終於攀談起來。於是我才知道他是一個現任的軍官，—一個多麼喧赫的上校，患了神經衰弱症進院療養的。</p>
<p>「……像你這麼結實的身體，同時文是一個武官，似乎不應該有這個病症」？我說。打着不大純粹的番話。</p>
<p>「區雲，（雲先生）其實文武又有什麽差異呢？一個人的人生，一給功名利祿所迷醉，爲了這富貴，功名的所謂人生的前途，誰個不絞盡腦汁去鈎心鬥角呢？……」</p>
<p>佛越里送過來幾聲宏亮而又沈重的鐘聲，黃昏的暗淡的陰影，彷彿埋伏的兵，從四週慢慢的伸展出來。</p>
<p>「人生原不過如此，富貴功名，原不過一塲飄渺的夢，倒不如做個無憂無慮的和尙來得樂趣哩！」他把眼晴緊緊地閉着，像和尙在佛像前參禪。</p>
<p>想着那個上校的話，我把床頭的電燈關熄起來，窗檻上的一瓶丁香花，給月亮印在粉白的牆壁上，我痴痴地凝望着牆壁上綺麗的花影，反心波平靜地睡去了。</p>

<p>— 譚曇</p>
<p>在目前都市中住着的人，除非十萬以上的富翁們可以在靜安寺路愚園路營一畝之園外，月入有限的薪給階級，實在沒有享受一株靑草的生意的幸福。其實這完全因爲他們自己不會佈置，假使稍費匠心，那末，卽使月入四五十元的人，也未始不可得到一些「花木」之歡。</p>
<p>我曾經詳細的計劃過，現在寫在下邊，以貢獻給住在上海的人們。</p>
<p>當然，無衣無食之人，現在是充斥於都市，我的計劃還不過爲了少數人着想。</p>
<p>首先我們須選擇租屋的地點，在鬧市中房租旣貴，同時騷聲太多，時常會破壞寗靜的空氣，特別重要的就是晚上燈光太亮，你立在天井裏舉頭看不到一個星星，而如水的月光也决不會浸你的苦階。</p>
<p>沒有能力居全幢房屋，最好設法租到樓下客堂間住。因爲單幢房屋的客堂間租下，這小天井，就無疑的屬於你。這就立刻把小天井兩邊的水泥地阱去各約一尺五寸到二尺。稍加人工，就成了很好的兩個「藥欄」。然後在右邊牆角種一株極肥大的月季花，月季栽培極易，同時時常開花有此一種，則雖別種花不開的時候也不至寂寞。月季附近種一株海棠，無論垂絲或貼梗的都好。有了他的塗抹腥紅，這錦樣三春，就可以對付。此外右邊這藥欄裏只要再種一二株美人蕉和鳳仙花，則炎夏和初秋，也有花可看。左邊則一株天南竹，不能忘了，他是常綠樹，卽使在下雪的嚴寒，也靑靑可愛珊瑚似的子和根下大一樣的茶花，把一個殘冬打發得十分熱鬧。當然木芙　是不能不種的，他的風露淸愁的姿態，實在是秋的靈魂，而牆隙藍色的秋海棠，愁雨愁風在殘秋時候更能釀出濃厚的秋滋味。有此幾種花木，則一年四季，都有點綴。</p>
<p>在春天行窗戶洞開，一院春光供我陶寫，夏夫你千萬不能忘了，在長窗外，都掛着綠色的竹後簾，牠不但能能隔絕陽光熱氣，同時更能使你得到浸在水裏的快感。秋天晚上，一庭月色，凉露零零，鳳仙花上一隻紡織娘不停的叫着，你把屋裏的燈熄了，從竹簾裏望出去，美人蕉綽約臨風，娟娟可愛，你這時候倚在沙發上，倒一杯苦茗，慢慢的呷着，此時景色，眞不知是詩是夢。冬天最好是大雪的晚上，你把窗戶嚴關，讓積雪的寒光從玻璃中反映過來，有酒的時候，就呷着酒，沒有酒時，呷呷白開水也好。有火爐自然生火，沒有火爐，就把綫被裹在身上。</p>
<p>最好的當然是雨天，尤其是秋雨連綿，朋友你或則還不知道雨天的好處他使你幽閑，他使你靜穆，他使你深沈，當然，他也會使你悲哀，但這悲哀是輕輕的，是渺漠的。這時侯你最好在牀上閑躺，看看並不費錢的書籍，倦了就拋開書，從窗裏望出去看那一絲絲一條條的微雨耐性的無力的落下來，秋海棠連這種微雨也禁不起垂着頭沉思着，那時你也可以跟着他沉思，從世事一直想到人生直到肚子餓得太厲害，才趿着鞋從牀上起來到叫麽地方吃飯去。</p>
<h3 id="c229">老年的悲哀 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 淡洱</p>
<p>養倪室內，漸漸時冷落靜寂下去。直至今年的初春，屋子門外的孩子們，連那價常的養倪室的老人的沉重的咳嗽聲，亦聽不見了。</p>
<p>村子裏，年來十分散亂，在從前視爲最可尊敬的養倪室的老人二太公，在年來是被鄕人們忘却了。特別靑年們、有時在門邊或巷裏逢着；連叫聲三太公和　　的點頭也沒心情幹了。這老人不安的晚境，加上一層說不出的痛苦，使他的臉色老是焦燥，陰沉的，很少說話。今春他終於積憂積苦而成病了，這也更使他悲哀，鄉人們怎麽連他的重病都不知道呢？沒有人來問候。</p>
<p>一個春天，老人像做了一塲上鬼門關的惡夢，他料定他這次，必然病死了；可是却還活着。而且竟能出房問，坐到幾個月不曾觸着的廳正中的那把太師椅上；他剛坐下去，扶着他的十三歲的小兒女正準備給他槌背，他却已感到渾身一陣酸痛。顯然，這是感觸到什麼而引起的。</p>
<p>老人睜着糊模的，失神的眼色，默默望向前面的天井，天井上散積着許多楊桃樹葉，爛得變成黑色的楊桃，枯黑的楊桃樹枝，妻寂，籠罩着一層衰落荒凉的情調；再慢慢移上目光，對面殘舊的黑瓦頂上，輕低的飄來了令老人心顫的寂寞的風，掠過懶懶的天井裏的楊桃樹的樹葉，妻微的，在悄悄中瑟瑟而嚮，老人的心像一支抖得快斷的絃綫，給什麽東西彈得他難奈。</p>
<p>他深深的嘆氣，深深的想，他覺得人生的空虛，而威到恐慌的悲哀。痛苦的晚年，將寂寞地衰殘下去，孤獨妻凉的死去！五個兒子，是一個也見不到了，垂着淚，似乎懊悔這次沒有死去；這次還有兩個兒子來送死呵！今後將更得見到吧……</p>
<p>南洋的三個兒子，因爲店子倒閉，錢沒寄，連音訊都斷絕，五兒是蒙難才脫，流落在外處；他們的產母親一想起便流淚。三兒的敎員又說靠不件了，村裏不安，匪風迫人，田地收不起租，賣也賣不出。一家人全是婦人孩子，怎麽活下去呢！而且還有人來迫債，說要對屋捕人。沒有兩三年，竟變得這麼快，這真像做夢呀！老人覺得痛苦而又奇異。他不知怎樣才好。他像墮落在生　可怕的荒谷，深淵裏去。這裏，全不像幾年前溫柔的安閒的家呵！他陷在各種可怕的思念中，全是枯　的肌肉，都生頭抖着。</p>
<p>在重病的昏沉沉中，纏了一個多月，把媳婦和女兒門累得竟出怨聲了，比較有錢的，夫家已搬到城裏去住的大女兒，在他老人的昏迷中說：『父親是沒希望了，好快點退福，免累死兒女，……』這明明是希望沒用而要累他們的父親快點死去，這偏給老人聽到了：人心怎麽壞到這樣，這世界，連兒女都……</p>
<p>幸好在快死中，見到了久別的三兒和五兒，他倆個回來的這挽，父親好些起來，母親說。可是，只過十多天，父親的痛吏危險，鄕村間却已滿城風雨，鄉人逃避匪風的已很多，夜間恐怖的聽着　　，可怕刺耳的鄕人的呼　　。而終於在父親的昏迷不醒中，兩個兒子走了，棄開危病的父親而走了！</p>
<p>老人盡是縐痕的頭額，像有人用刀在戮着。頭垂下去，在淚聲中問傍邊的小女兒：『匪好點了吧？……你哥哥走時有說什麼沒有……」</p>
<p>『下埔昨夜又給來了，還捉人去……」</p>
<p>『扶我進房子裏去吧……」老人難堪的悲哀，痛楚得他不能支持下去……</p>

<p>— 琴</p>
<p>老友黃素酋，雲間狂士，工書善畫，卓越常倫，一下筆目無餘子，然儘自牢騷感慨，而從不喜以文字駡人，常謂自駡乃自重，罵人非特自輕，人且笑我窄也，憶其民國初年，自題所仿梅花菴道人畫云，『或譽予三絕，予乃自稱有四絕，懷才不遇，坐食山空，呼籲無門，婦子愁　，是爲絕門絕路，洩盡天機，磨穿鐵硯，山靈怒目，魑魅喜過，奪其天年，傾其宗祀，是之謂絕子絕孫，然前世有梅花菴，我必從道人去矣」，題所仿石濤畫云，『詩書畫皆擬石濤，門庭枯寂，冷淡如僧，筆墨蕭條，知音絕少，零丁身世，自與瞎尊者有會心也，」又自書聯云，『昻頭窺天地外，失足墮詩書中，』蓋其時正在鄉縱酒疎狂，滿懷鬱勃，偶於題跋間洩焉，終未嘗一語毀人，庚申以後，粥畫滬濱，益復韜晦自攻，狂態盡歛矣。（却酬）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Six Breaches in the Canal, Water Rushing Northeast; Four Feet Deep Near the Jinan to Zou County Highway; Both Nanyang and Shushan Lakes Rising, Civilians Striving to Plug the Breaches <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) At 3 AM this morning, the east bank of the lower reaches of the Grand Canal breached in the Xindian area, 15 li southeast of Jinan City, with a breach of over two zhang. Also, at 9 AM this morning, another breach of over two zhang occurred south of the New Sluice. Also, at 4:30 AM this morning, four breaches occurred north of the shop, over four li away, with two breaches exceeding one zhang and two breaches exceeding two and three zhang respectively. The water is rushing directly northeast. Although the civilians are desperately trying to plug the breaches, the water is too turbulent, and the wind and waves are too high, making it impossible to plug them. The water has reached four chi deep near the highway from Jinan to Zou County. Due to the downstream breaches, the water level in the upper reaches of the Grand Canal is dropping, and the water levels in Nanyang Lake and Shushan Lake are rising. The western embankment of Nanyang Lake has breached, and the water has reached the Jinan to Jiaxiang highway. The local populace is currently using the highway as a dam to prevent the water from flowing north. East of the Jinan to Jixiang highway, the water is five or six chi deep. All telephone lines are down. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The disaster victims from various counties transported to Yanzhou have reached 4,000. They are being dispersed to Tai'an, Qufu, Zouteng. A reception center has been added to Heze. Han is changing the main Yellow River current, directly impacting it, the Zhu Kou dam is adding to the breaches, ready to enter into Jiangsu, The River Bureau has been ordered to implement strict precautions, and telegrams have been sent to the county chiefs along the Wei River, Xiaoqing River, and the Grand Canal, instructing them to pay attention to river defenses. If a rise in water level is not reported within three days before a disaster occurs, they will be charged with dereliction of duty. The breach in Nanyang Lake has caused the water to shift northeast, threatening to directly impact the Jinpu Railway. Representatives Zhang Honglie from Shandong and Yu, Zhang Jingyu from Henan, and Zhang Hanying from the Yellow River Commission, arrived from Puyang yesterday to inspect and accept the completed Jin Dike to Taochengbu Dike. They returned to Jinan today.

<p>(Xuzhou) The Peixian long-distance telephone reported this afternoon that Ding Chaowu, Na Hanyuan, and Lan Weibin went to the Weishan Lake coast to inspect. The water level of Weishan Lake remains the same. A water gauge has been set up in Xia Town. The Construction Department has specially dispatched engineer Yu Shufang to Xia Town to inspect. No Yellow River flow has been found yet. Xia Town is located on the north bank of Weishan Lake and is an important passage from the lake mouth to the upper Grand Canal. After the Yellow River water enters Nanyang Lake, because the south bank is higher, most of it overflows north, flowing towards Jining. However, if the main current continues to arrive, it will still flood Weishan Lake. Over 100,000 civilians from Tongshan, Pei County, and Feng County in northern Jiangsu are continuing to rush to build the northern Jiangsu Dike, which will surely be completed as scheduled.

The counties west of Xuzhou advocate opening the dam to discharge water, while the counties east of Xuzhou advocate building the dam to prevent flooding. An on-site inspection must be conducted before a decision can be made. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Forty-nine counties in Hubei reported disasters. The authorities plan to advance emergency relief, agricultural relief, and industrial relief in parallel, requiring a total of 12 million yuan. They decided to request the central government to allocate 5 million yuan first for application. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun urgently telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the 24th, stating that 49 counties in Hubei Province have now reported disasters, accounting for more than two-thirds of the entire province. He and Commissioner Xu Shiying took a plane to inspect the low-lying areas of the Xiang River and the Han River, and the fields were washed away, and people and animals were drifting everywhere. The entire territory of counties such as Tianmen and Hanchuan is still submerged in huge floods. Except for the treetops and rooftops above the water, nothing can be seen. Xu also sighed that it was an unprecedented catastrophe. Without a large amount of relief funds, the surviving people will have no place to live or food to eat, and they will either die from water or from hunger and disease. In addition, the bandit forces in the border areas of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi are rampant, and they are likely to be coerced and incited, which is very worrying. After the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Flood Relief Association, it planned three emergency relief, agricultural relief, and industrial relief projects, requiring a total of more than 12 million yuan. However, the local area is devastated and impoverished, and Wuhan's financial resources are also exhausted, and fundraising is ineffective. Please consider that the disaster in Hubei is extremely serious and allocate 5 million yuan first. If it is difficult to raise a large amount of funds, allocate 5 million yuan from the central government's recent bond issue to respond to this emergency and save the crisis. Also, telegraph Chiang, asking him to forward the telegraph. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Significance of the Major Reorganization of Japanese Army Officers <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Since Lieutenant General Mazaki Jinzaburo, the Inspector General of Education of the Japanese Army, was forced to resign, the Japanese Ministry of the Army seems to have a trend of thoroughly reorganizing internally. Recently, according to the Japanese Associated Press, Army Minister Hayashi has received imperial permission from the Japanese Emperor and will officially announce the order for a major reorganization of army officers on August 1. The number of personnel transferred is estimated to be around 3,500. Generals Hishikari Takashi and Matsui Iwane, and Lieutenant General Hata Shunroku, commander of the 2nd Division, are all on the list of those to be dismissed. Although this unprecedented reorganization of the army is due to complex relationships and the future is still difficult to predict, it can be said that it is a success of Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro's army control policy.</p>
<p>The internal affairs of the Japanese Ministry of the Army have always been complex, and factions have been divided. Since Araki stepped down from his post, internal undercurrents have intensified. The reason why Army Minister Hayashi has repeatedly expressed passivity is that it is difficult to control. At present, the factions of the Ministry of the Army can be roughly divided into three factions: (1) The Control Faction, centered on Army Minister Hayashi. The current Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Nagata Tetsuzo, the newly appointed Inspector General of Education, Watanabe Jotaro, and Generals Abe, Honjo, Minami, and other military councilors are supporters of Army Minister Hayashi's policies. (2) The Justice Faction, centered on Mazaki. Its inner circle includes division commanders such as Yanagawa, Hata Shunroku, Kashii, and Kazuki, as well as major generals and colonels such as Obata and Yamaoka. (3) The Qing Army Faction, with Koiso and Matsui as its main members. The above three factions all belong to the military, but their common policies differ. Army Minister Hayashi has always been known for his prudence, and has gained the trust of elder statesmen and industrial leaders, and is also quite close to Ugaki. He is a relatively neutral figure. General Mazaki originally belonged to the southwestern faction of the Saga clique and was very close to right-wing ronin. He has always had bad feelings towards Army Minister Hayashi. The Koiso faction is relatively weak and often clashes with the Mazaki faction. The Mazaki faction has always been the most powerful of these three factions.</p>
<p>It is clear that General Mazaki, in this situation of confrontation, is dissatisfied with Army Minister Hayashi and is planning to make some changes. In January of this year, he met secretly with Kuwabara Fusanosuke, the general manager of the Seiyukai, at Nampoin in Azabu. The Mazaki faction provided materials to attack the military for lacking control capabilities. (China United News Agency) In May of this year, when China and Japan exchanged ambassadors, some soldiers in the Japanese military held different opinions. It is said that Mazaki was also involved. This proves that the open and secret struggles between the two factions have not been for a day or two.</p>
<p>The reason why Army Minister Hayashi was able to resolutely and decisively use swift means to clear up internal obstacles is due to Hayashi's decisiveness on the one hand, and reliance on strength on the other. Since the establishment of the Japanese cabinet council in mid-May, the forces of the stable faction of the military have united with those of the elder statesmen, senior ministers, nobles, and industrial leaders. This combination is a new situation formed by the collision of the old and new factions. Army Minister Hayashi has gained the support of the elder statesmen and senior ministers, and his power has become even more consolidated. Now he has advanced to implement and implement the army's control policy.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can know that this major reorganization of Japanese army officers is by no means accidental. Its significance is, on the one hand, to cater to the psychology of those who generally tend towards conservatism, and on the other hand, to form a unity between the military and external policies, so that the implementation of diplomatic policies is more in step, planned, and effective. As for its basic policy, it has never been changed. Therefore, future policies towards China will inevitably be "consistent." Even if there is a difference, it is only a matter of urgency.</p>

(B) When negotiating the revision of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Regulations and the Railway Police Regulations, the following items should be noted: (1) Land used by the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway should be taxed according to land rent, and unused land should be returned immediately. (2) The passenger and freight rates of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway should be reduced from the current rates. Future rate regulations must be approved by the Chinese government and not arbitrarily increased by the railway company.

<h3 id="e29">Dissatisfaction with Japan's Position on Abyssinia: Anti-Japanese Sentiment is High in Italy; Believed to be Disrupting European Peace and Unity; Simultaneously Reproaches Britain for Lifting the Arms Embargo <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Anti-Japanese sentiment is becoming increasingly intense today, almost shifting public attention away from the government's abolition of the 40% gold reserve for banknotes. Prime Minister Mussolini's official newspaper severely criticized Japan for inciting Abyssinia to resist Italy and violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and hoping to undermine the unity of Britain, France, and Italy in maintaining European peace. The newspaper further stated that Japan is caught in the dream of imperialism, obviously seeking to take the place of white people in Africa. Today, four armed policemen and two plainclothes detectives patrol in front of the Japanese Embassy for protection. (July 23rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italians are indignant because Japan is favoring Abyssinia. Today, a special guard is stationed in front of the Japanese Embassy to prevent accidents. At the same time, Italian newspapers are also conducting anti-Japanese propaganda. The Italian People's Newspaper stated that Japan's new attitude contradicts the statement made by Sugimura, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, that Japan has no political relationship with Abyssinia. Japan's sudden expression of sympathy for the poor and barren Abyssinia proves its ambition to carry out unlimited political and economic development in Africa as a new base for attacking Europe. A report that anti-Japanese demonstrations took place in Milan and three other places yesterday has been denied by semi-official sources, saying that the excitement of the people in the three cities was caused by Mussolini's recent declaration on Abyssinia. The anti-Japanese movement has not diminished the Italian attacks on Britain in recent weeks. The famous political writer, Gaida, wrote an article in the newspapers, saying that the British cabinet's decision not to prohibit the export of arms to both Italy and Abyssinia is clear evidence of Anglo-Abyssinian unity. (July 24th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun today published an article that appears to be authorized by the authorities, saying that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very indignant about the anti-Japanese propaganda in the Italian newspapers. The Italian newspapers are deliberately fostering a hostile public opinion towards Japan and engaging in an orderly conspiracy to develop the Italo-Abyssinian dispute into a war between colored people and white people. The Italians hope to use this method to force Britain and France to protect Italy's policies. Japan is now on guard, not wanting to be manipulated by the Italians. Japan is now watching the development of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute with a calm and cautious attitude. The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with the press this morning to discuss the Italian newspapers' attitude towards Japan. A reporter asked whether Japanese newspapers would remain silent if Italian newspapers provoked Japan in this way. The spokesman replied that the opinions of Japanese newspapers are different from the news published in countries with freedom of speech. The spokesman finally said that the Japanese government is considering sending an ambassador to Abyssinia in January next year. (July 24th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The situation of the Abyssinian Emperor's birthday yesterday was reported by the Times correspondent in the Abyssinian capital as follows: Before dawn, the residents were awakened from their sleep by a 21-gun salute. In the early morning, the streets were crowded with people. Numerous infantrymen surrounded the soldiers of various tribes and many chieftains who came from all over to pay their respects, winding into the city. Each chieftain was riding on a donkey and holding a velvet flag as a symbol of paying respects. Flags were hung all over the city. Then, at 9:00 a.m., the emperor, dressed in ordinary clothes, ascended the palace, surrounded by cabinet ministers and advisors. On the palace steps in front of the palace, there were modern guards standing on both sides. There were also officers with decorated lion manes, holding spears and shields, and wearing gorgeous crowns, ascending the palace. Then the officers of the guards and representatives of the diplomatic corps paid their respects to the emperor. After the ceremony, five thousand soldiers held a grand meat feast, and the emperor also participated in it. On this day, only the governor of Waleka Province, who was far away in the extreme west and not affected by the situation, was able to leave his post to come to the capital to celebrate the birthday. The other governors were all at their posts and could not come to the capital. Moreover, of the diplomatic corps, only the Italian envoy to Abyssinia, Grigulucci, was absent. The Abyssinian side believed that the celebration ceremony was grand, more attentive than the palaces of European countries. The Italian envoy's absence was a serious insult, but the Abyssinian government decided not to pursue it. (July 24th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Abyssinian Capital) Today is the 42nd birthday of the King of Abyssinia. After a 21-gun salute, the King sat on the throne in the old palace to receive the congratulations of the princes, ministers, and envoys of various countries. The Belgian envoy, Johnson, delivered the congratulations of the envoys on behalf of the diplomatic corps. The Italian envoy and consulate staff did not participate. The Japanese Emperor also sent a telegram of congratulations, which is considered very important by political circles here and will arouse anti-Japanese propaganda in the Italian newspapers. When the American representative entered the city after the ceremony, an incident occurred. The crowd surrounded his car, waving flags and shouting "Long live America!" This enthusiastic expression was due to the US government's permission for officers to join the Abyssinian army and the American Red Cross's willingness to provide assistance. The British fear a large-scale air raid on the Abyssinian capital, and the embassy authorities have made proper defense arrangements to avoid being bombed. (July 23rd, National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) There are rumors that Britain intends to allow arms to be transported to Abyssinia. Political circles here are unwilling to comment on this matter until they receive official news from Britain. However, the general attitude is that anyone who does not support Italy is hostile to Italy. The newspapers here all carry warnings to Britain not to favor Abyssinia. One newspaper said that when Britain and Japan compete to transport contraband arms to Abyssinia to the Red Sea, Italy will use artillery shells to judge who wins the championship. (July 24th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the British cabinet allowed arms to be imported into Abyssinia, the newspapers here unanimously attacked Britain. The Italian Daily stated that if the news of Britain's lifting of the arms export ban to Abyssinia is true, Italy cannot but regard this move by Britain as a hostile act against Italy, because this move is tantamount to helping the barbaric Abyssinian attack civilized Italy. Therefore, Abyssinia's arrogance today is largely due to Britain's assistance. Finally, the newspaper warned the British government that Britain's lifting of the arms export ban has created a major bad precedent in the international community. (July 24th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) At a meeting of the House of Commons today, many members questioned Britain's policy on transporting arms to Abyssinia.

<h3 id="e34">Italo-Abyssinian Dispute: League of Nations to Discuss Comprehensively; British Proposal Supported by France <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that when the League of Nations Executive Council meets next week to consider the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the British government intends to urge a comprehensive discussion. The hope of resolving the dispute peacefully before the Executive Council meets is now very slim. After French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval held talks with British Ambassador to Paris, Clark, it is expected that the British proposal for a comprehensive discussion will be supported by France. Britain recently sought a basis for discussion in Rome and learned that the Italian government will not be satisfied unless it annexes Abyssinia or at least obtains political control of part or all of Abyssinia. At that time, the possibility of convening a meeting of the three countries that signed the 1906 treaty (Britain, France, and Italy) was also discussed, but unless Italy guarantees not to resort to force, the meeting will be difficult to convene. British Ambassador to Rome, Sir Drummond, urged Italy to thoroughly state its case against Abyssinia in Geneva, but Italy still does not seem to want to do this. If Italy insists on this attitude, the situation will become tense when the League of Nations Executive Council meets in the future and invokes Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant. It is expected that the British representative attending the Executive Council meeting will be Eden, Minister without Portfolio. (Note: Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant states that if a dispute arises between members of the League of Nations that is likely to lead to a rupture, the matter should be submitted to arbitration or to the Executive Council for review, and it is agreed that in any case, war shall not be waged until three months after the arbitrators' judgment or the Executive Council's report has expired.) (July 24th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) According to observations by diplomatic circles, it is difficult to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute through diplomatic channels before the League of Nations Executive Council meets, because Italy will not agree to promise not to engage in war during the negotiations. France has now accepted that the League of Nations will conduct a comprehensive study of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Diplomatic circles are very satisfied with this. However, the rumor that Britain and France have reached an agreement on the procedures for resolving the dispute in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant has not been confirmed. (According to Section 7 of Article 15, if the members of the Executive Council, except for the representative(s) of one or more of the disputing parties, cannot unanimously approve the report, the member states of the League of Nations reserve the right to take the necessary actions they deem necessary to maintain fairness and justice.) In general, political circles mostly agree to invoke Article 12 of the Covenant to deal with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. (July 23rd, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The date of the League of Nations Executive Council meeting must be decided today when League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol consults with Prime Minister Laval. Newspapers this morning stated that it can now be determined that the League of Nations Executive Council will meet at the end of this month. The only thing that has not been decided is how long the meeting will last, but the main issues will not be discussed until the end of August. According to the "Warfare" newspaper, officials believe that Italy will definitely attend the meeting, but the Italians require the powers to guarantee that the debate will not deviate from a certain scope. Therefore, the entire issue is expected to come to a temporary conclusion within 48 hours. Compulsory resolutions and the invocation of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant will have to wait until the League of Nations meeting at the end of August to be discussed. (July 24th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Semi-official sources confirmed that the British and French governments have agreed to convene the League of Nations Executive Council for discussion within the next week. The date will be determined by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, Chairman of the Executive Council. Mr. Litvinov is expected to arrive in Paris by Thursday. It is now understood that the Italo-Abyssinian issue will be discussed in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. (July 23rd, National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Abyssinian envoy to Britain, Martin, recently gave an interview to a reporter from the "Paris Echo," expressing pessimism about the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. He said, "A compromise solution is not easy to achieve. The Italian side has already spent more than ten million lire on military expenses, and its army sent to Africa has more than 200,000 men. How can we expect them to stop the war plan? Moreover, what Italy seeks is not just economic concessions, but the annexation of our country. Even if we give economic concessions or even territorial concessions to Italy, we cannot know what the result will be. The country's desires are increasing day by day. Looking at the past, I am deeply moved. Emperor Menelik once gave a large piece of land, Eritrea, to Italy, but Italy's desires were not satisfied. This can be seen." Martin continued, "Abyssinia should protect its independence with an indomitable spirit. The Italo-Abyssinian dispute is still very serious for Britain. Once Italy invades Abyssinia, Egypt and British Sudan will be threatened, and the balance of power along the Red Sea will also be shaken, benefiting Italy and harming Britain. In other words, the route from Europe to India will be threatened by Italy. In short, once the Italo-Abyssinian war breaks out, its scope will extend beyond local warfare and become a trigger for conflict between colored people and white colonial countries." Martin also said, "If Britain and France are willing to cede a portion of their colonies to Italy as compensation, they can do so themselves. Abyssinia will never cede an inch of land."

<p>Italy Explains the Purpose of Abolishing Gold Reserves: Hoping to Avoid Misunderstandings Abroad</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Italy's suspension of the legal reserve clause of the central bank, Japanese foreign exchange banks observe as follows: Italy's distress lies in the stagnation of foreign trade. Other purely economic reasons, such as the decline in foreign tourist spending and remittances from immigrants, are the main reasons for the devaluation. This suspension is only using the Italo-Abyssinian dispute as an excuse to avoid criticism from the gold bloc countries and to carry out the devaluation to increase its competitiveness in the international economy. If the devaluation of the Italian currency is realized, the Laval cabinet in France seems to have escaped the crisis, and the anxiety of the European gold bloc countries will become more intense. (July 24th, Dentsu News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) In order to avoid misunderstandings caused by the abolition of the 40% gold reserve for Italian currency, the official statement issued today stated that the plan adopted yesterday concerning gold reserves had no effect on the currency value. The Italian government will restore the 40% gold reserve in the near future. The plan adopted yesterday was because the debt owed to foreigners reached 500,000,000 lire, which urgently needed to be repaid. Therefore, the government had no choice but to amend the gold reserve law. The government has now been able to repay all debts, and the debt owed to foreign countries was used by the government to purchase raw materials. (July 23rd, National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>The Hague: Today, the Dutch cabinet issued a statement expressing the Collin government's determination to maintain the gold standard. The statement said that as long as the government exists, it will continue to do its best to reject the policy of currency devaluation. At the same time, to avoid the tide of cabinet changes, it has asked the Lower House to adjourn. The Lower House, with the support of the Catholic Party for the government's economic bill, also wants to give the government a chance to reconsider. However, according to a statement issued by the Catholic Party, although the party members are prepared to support the Collin cabinet's economic laws, they are still unwilling to give it a vote of confidence. Prime Minister Collin claimed that he was prepared to ask Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to consider the policy to deal with the situation. According to political circles, Collin and the cabinet may submit their resignations, but the Queen may dissolve Parliament and retain Collin. (July 24th, National Telegram)</p>

In my opinion, in the current extraordinary situation, national defense should be the first priority.

<p>Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries Have Always Been Good; Hoping to Negotiate and Conclude a New Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Egyptian government submitted a memorandum on the 18th notifying the abolition of the Japanese-Egyptian Treaty of Commerce. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to have Consul General Amaki personally deliver a reply in the near future. The content seems to be to urge the Egyptian government to reflect. The general situation is recorded as follows: (1) In its memorandum, the Egyptian government stated that Japanese-Egyptian trade is one-sided in that imports exceed exports, and pointed out the actual situation. However, the figures it cited differ greatly from the Japanese statistical figures. Moreover, the total amount of Japanese imports from Egypt has recently increased significantly. The total number of Egyptian imports in the first half of this year reached 32 million yuan, while Japanese exports to Egypt were only 25 million yuan. Japan is in a situation where imports exceed exports. (2) The Egyptian government has always advocated the conclusion of a new treaty to replace the Japanese-Egyptian Treaty of Commerce, and based on the protection of Egyptian domestic industries. If Japanese exports to Egypt threaten the country's domestic industries, the precedent of the Indo-Japanese negotiations should be followed and measures should be discussed to resolve the issue. However, the Egyptian government did not do this and suddenly announced the abolition of the Treaty of Commerce. The procedure is somewhat regrettable. (3) Japan has always been friendly to Egypt, and will continue its friendly relations in the future. Therefore, the budget for this year also includes the funds needed to establish a Japanese branch embassy in Cairo, and preparations are underway. As for trade relations, Japan will do its best to respect Egypt's intentions and attempt to adjust its relations. Therefore, the Egyptian government should also be based on facts as much as possible when handling the aftermath of the abolition of the old treaty and concluding a new treaty, and try to deal with it properly. It is hoped that this will be the case. (July 24th, Japan Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Existing Ships Are Mostly Decayed and Unsuitable</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph today published an article by Bywater, stating that after the expiration of the London Naval Treaty in December 1936, Britain will immediately begin building sixty cruisers. Currently, the number of British warships is limited to fifty. The naval review held at Spithead to commemorate the King's Jubilee included a total of one hundred and fifty-seven warships of various sizes. While the appearance was formidable, many members of Parliament felt that the majority of the warships were no longer effective, and the combat equipment lacked efficiency, leaving them with an unpleasant impression. Few ships were of the new type, while a large number were decayed and unsuitable for combat. This has sparked comments from all sides. Of the eleven battleships that the British Navy currently prides itself on, only the HMS Royal Oak and HMS Hood are of the latest type, but they were launched more than ten years ago. The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships are over twenty years old, and their speed is nominally twenty-five knots, but this has been greatly reduced after being fitted with heavy armor. By the time the London Naval Treaty expires, half of Britain's cruisers, half of its destroyers, and one-third of its submarines will be nearing the end of their service life. This is the main argument of those who oppose the Anglo-German naval agreement. Critics argue that all German warships in the future will be of the new type. The article concludes by saying that Admiral Sir Roger Keyes and former First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill have requested raising a naval loan to repair the ships that are unsuitable for modern warfare, and support for this is growing.

<p>(Washington) According to official sources today, the United States still hopes that Britain will convene the 1935 naval conference. Experts here also claim that Britain's abandonment of the ratio system is aimed at gaining Japan's approval for other alternative plans, making the British Navy the standard for other countries. The word "ratio" creates the perception of inequality for countries whose navies are below the maximum limit. Therefore, future efforts in international disarmament will be based on the principles of equality or security. It is worth noting that the United States, with its longer coastline, should have more warships if it actually wants to be on an equal footing with Japan. (National Telegraph, 23rd)</p>

<p>(London) The British veterans delegation, having completed its visit to Germany, returned here from Berlin this morning. Major Gortley, the head of the delegation, issued a statement to the press, stating, "The trip was a success, and the understanding between Britain and Germany has been improved as a result. The actual situation in Germany is very different from the impression we had in Britain. We originally intended to meet only with the German Veterans Association and not to contact the German government. However, it is difficult to separate the German Veterans Association from government agencies, as most of the current government is made up of veterans." Regarding the rumor that the British veterans delegation refused to lay a wreath at the memorial to the National Socialist Party in Cologne, he said that the newspaper reports were exaggerated. Finally, Gortley stated that the British and German veterans organizations are arranging for their children to exchange studies with each other, and hope that German veterans will visit Britain.

<h3 id="e95">A Record of Inspecting the Disaster Situation of the Rivers <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— By Geng Ya, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Hankou (Continued)</p>
<p>On the border of Anhui and Jiangxi, opposite Madang, the Mahua Dam, which belongs to Pengze in Jiangxi and Qiu Pu Dongliu, collapsed in two or three places successively in the early part of this month due to the difficulty of discharging accumulated water internally and the fierce impact of the flood externally. Villages and fields in the levee within the two provinces were all submerged, and the losses were incalculable. According to reports, the dam is fifteen feet wide and rises a few inches to a few feet above the water level. Its collapse was not due to overflowing and washing away, but to a sudden collapse. The new dam had not yet been built firmly, resulting in seepage of trickle, which led to a major disaster. Going west from Anqing, the disaster situation becomes more severe. Where the dikes are intact, the seedlings are green and a good harvest can still be expected. If the dikes collapse, there is a vast expanse of water with no trace of crops. Only an occasional willow tree can be seen, which can be used to measure the shape of the fields. In several places, the river surface and the levee are much higher than the fields on both sides, and the tails of the houses are also below the water level. Once the river dike collapses, the torrent rages and becomes uncontrollable. The disaster area is extremely large, and the floodwater is difficult to recede in a short time due to the excessive height of the levee, making the disaster even worse than the Yellow River disaster. Therefore, the way to control the river is not only to increase the height of the dikes, but also to pay close attention to the dredging of the waterways.</p>
<p>The water in Jiujiang is also on the shore, and each road such as No. 1, 2, 3, Da Zhong, and Binjiang are three or four feet deep. Pedestrians mostly use rickshaws or small boats as transportation. Residents beside Gan Tang Lake live in water. A section of Lushan Road is also flooded and cannot be driven on. Most of the internal lakes have overflowed. More than a hundred civil levees in the Poyang Lake area have collapsed. According to reports, the water disaster area in Jiangxi Province this time is as many as forty-five counties. The disasters were all caused by continuous rain and floods. For example, the water level in various villages in Wuyuan and the West Gate are all higher than the city walls. The refugees in Guixi are floating on the roofs, crying for help with no response, and countless deaths. All thirty-eight levees in Yongxiu were washed away, drowning more than a thousand people. In the newly built flood, starvation and hunger are intertwined, and there are more cases of people who eat grass to relieve their hunger and die from abdominal distension. The tragic situation is unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>Passing through Wuxue at noon on the 19th, the lower part of the riverside houses was submerged in water. The ship did not dock and only took a distant photo. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the China Relief Council, and his party of six came west to survey the disaster. Although we were fortunate to be on the same ship, Mr. Xu looked far away with a telescope while the ship was traveling, and referred to the maps. When the ship stopped, he inspected and guided the local defenses. He was worried and worked hard all day long, and rarely had the opportunity to talk to the outside world. On the evening when he was about to arrive in Hankou, I made a special request to ask him about his feelings.</p>
<p>The main points of the conversation are roughly as follows: "The ability of local officials and people to defend against disasters this time is better than before, but the social economy and the ability to provide disaster relief are far worse than before. We are discussing with the authorities of various provinces the urgent measures to revitalize industry and address both the symptoms and root causes. The central government will do its best to provide subsidies. After receiving the actual situation in various places in the future, we will truthfully report to the central government to make it clear about the severity of the flood disaster and the suffering of the people. As for the way to control the water, unless huge funds are raised (approximately 500 million yuan in total) and a comprehensive plan is made, and the Jianghuai and Han rivers are fundamentally treated, the water damage in the future will be even worse than this time." According to another piece of information, Mr. Xu already has a relatively feasible good plan for raising huge funds for water control, but it has not yet been approved by the central government, so the announcement is still pending.</p>
<p>Arrived in Hankou the next morning, unloaded luggage at the hotel, and went to the nearby Jiang Han Guan area. The water level was 50.7 feet, which was slightly lower than before, but the Linjiang Road outside the embankment was still being impacted by the river water. From time to time, a turtle was rolled up by the waves and dried on the embankment slope. A child caught it and wanted to take it home, but everyone was afraid of offending the Dragon King and insisted on releasing it back into the river. Although this is a superstitious detail, it also shows the inner fear of the crowd. The ditch water that leaked out of the various roads into the river was specially equipped with a drainage machine to pour it over the levee into the river because the river water was higher than the road surface, fearing the impact of backflow. In the few days before the water level was higher, the citizens were terrified of the pain of the twenty years ago, and most of them moved their homes from low to high places. The important stocks of shops also moved to the second and third floors.</p>
<p>Crossing the river to the Xujiapeng station on the Yuehan Railway, I saw that the railway of a certain transshipment company had been washed away for tens of feet. The station pier was even connected with unroofed iron cars as a bridge. Although walking was very stable, it was a pity that it was an underutilization of materials. Many of the nearby houses were also drifting in the water. Looking at the watermarks on their doors and windows, some were duck-yellow with a hint of green, about a foot above the water surface, which was the water level that had made people horrified a few days ago. A foot higher, there was still a light brown color, which was the tragic trace of the great flood twenty years ago. When the reporter was taking pictures in the mirror, I saw a pale-faced young woman on the flooded building, leaning on the railing and holding a child, shaking and humming, "Maomao, don't cry anymore. Someone is here to inspect the flood. We will have something to eat soon. Maomao, don't cry..." Hearing this, I felt unspeakable pain in my heart. However, the most tragic places in Wuhan are probably still in Zhanggongdi, Danshuichi, Shaijiashan, Jinyintan, and Gushushu. This is just a small part of it.</p>
<p>Hubei Province is surrounded by the Jianghan rivers, and is known as a land of lakes. Every summer and autumn, it suffers from floods and disasters. The scars of the twentieth and twenty-second years have not yet healed, and this autumn it has suffered its misfortune again. In the upper reaches, the floods shook the valleys, and the mountains collapsed. In the lower reaches, the floods rushed and raged, with thousands of miles of water. As of the 22nd, the number of counties that have reported disaster situations to the provincial government has reached as many as forty-nine. According to what Mr. Xu Zhen, the committee chairman, and his party obtained by looking down from the air, all the ten or so counties in the upper reaches of Jianghan were vast expanses of water. In the central region, such as Tianmen and Hanchuan, the disaster situation was the most serious, and the entire territory was in the water. Others who could see the tops of city walls, roofs, and treetops were also very few in number. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims have been displaced and are all waiting to be rescued.</p>

<p>Supervise the Clearing of Old Cases and Guide the Implementation of New Laws</p>
<p>Wang Yongbin, Minister of Justice and Administration, had a plan to inspect the actual judicial situation in various provinces at the beginning of his tenure. Later, due to the complexity of departmental affairs, the date of departure was repeatedly delayed. Because the new criminal law and the three-level three-trial system were promulgated and implemented, it would be a month, Wang used his department's important official duties, dealing with them late into the night, hoping to set off at the end of this month. His inspection route is scheduled to be Shandong, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces. He plans to spend a month to be able to return to Beijing to attend the National Judicial Conference, which will open in mid-September. The Daily News reporter asked about the main objectives of this inspection tour as Wang's departure approached yesterday. He was informed one by one, and his talks are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Guide the Implementation of New Laws</p>
<p>Wang said first that after the implementation of the new criminal law, the new criminal procedure law, the civil procedure law, and the three-level three-trial system, the ministry had already sent special commissioners to various places to supervise and guide. However, it is necessary to personally inspect the progress of the implementation in various provinces and whether the accumulated cases have been cleared. The intention of the central government to change the legal system is to reduce the accidental spiritual and material damage to the parties. The first step in the current implementation is to clear the accumulated cases, so that both trial and execution can benefit. During this trip, I will strictly set deadlines to urge the clearing of old cases, and at the same time provide detailed guidance to ensure that the implementation of the new law is without any ambiguity. When the national legal system is just beginning to change, the implementing agencies will inevitably encounter difficulties and doubts, and need to be instructed and explained.</p>
<p>Correct the Style of Prolonging Detention</p>
<p>In the past, local judicial organs often conducted detailed investigations and collected evidence for criminal cases, prolonging the judgment, and involving various criminals. Many of them have been detained in the detention center for many years without being interrogated. For example, recently in a certain place, an old man in his eighties was arrested for a minor case. As a result, he died in the detention center because he could not bear the suffering of being imprisoned. This kind of thing is really uneasy on the conscience. If the case is settled early, the crimes that the criminals should be punished for can be executed quickly, and those who are suspected of being wronged can also be cleared and rehabilitated early. If the case is delayed, not only will the innocent suffer the pain of detention for nothing, but the criminals will also increase the suffering of detention, and even the detention period will exceed the sentence. It is contrary to the spirit of national rule of law and the loss of national production and people's lives and careers. This trend, if not strictly corrected, will not only fail to empty the prisons, but will also lead to overcrowding. Therefore, I must try to correct it on this trip.</p>
<p>Dredge Inmate in Custody</p>
<p>I will pay special attention to the dredging of detainees in detention centers in various places. Prisons are places where convicted criminals serve their sentences, and only need to investigate their food, hygiene, education, and facilities. Detention centers are places of custody. Those who are detained have not been determined whether they have committed a crime. It is also common for good citizens to be detained because of slight suspicion. The treatment, equipment, and handling should be slightly better than prisons. But in fact, detention centers in various places are simplified, and the number of detainees is increasing year by year, due to the increase in criminal cases in recent years. The dredging of detention centers is a more pressing issue. The Legislative Yuan has passed a method of dredging prisoners, and the dredging of detention centers is only to urge bail and speedy settlement of cases.</p>
<p>Tell the Conscience Responsibility</p>
<p>Wang said at the end that on this tour, I will tell all judicial officials to emphasize that "the moral character of judges should be equally important as their conscientious responsibility" He could not consider the actual pain and damage suffered by the parties involved. This is because their duties as judges are flawless, but their conscientious responsibility is lacking. For example, in the past, local judges often detained those who could be detained or not detained, and prosecuted those who could be prosecuted or not prosecuted. When their judgments were executed, they were often reluctant to grant probation and parole, seeking only to reduce their own responsibilities, and disregarding the pain of those who suffered. If this is the case, how can it be in line with the spirit of the national legislation to set up this lenient provision? It is reported that the provinces that Wang plans to inspect on this trip are all areas that the former Minister Luo Wengan did not go to. Yang Peng, Counselor of the Ministry, Wang Dengdi, Section Chief, Liao Weixun, Secretary Chen Daqi and other five people will accompany the inspection. It is reported that Wang will also inspect some courts in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces on his way back when time permits. (Daily News)</p>

<p>Section Chief Inspects Seawall Engineering</p>
<p>The seawall of this county was repaired with new-style cement steel bars at a cost of tens of thousands of yuan during the tenure of Director Xu Wei of the Construction Bureau in the 19th year. After the strong wind and rain the year before, the turbulent tide destroyed the piles and dikes. Last year, key repairs were made. Unexpectedly, the cement in sections 245 of the seawall has been washed away in many places. The county government has recently reported the previous situation based on the report of the seawall guards. Xu Mojia, Section Chief of the Third Section of the county government, and technician Yang Lufu drove to the spot for inspection on the 23rd. It was found that the seawall was in danger. After compiling the cost of repairs, the county magistrate submitted it to the Provincial Department of Construction for review and requested funding to prepare for construction.</p>

<p>Eight Criminals Escape from the Sixth Branch Bureau</p>
<p>On the 22nd of this month, the Sixth Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau of this county sent police to arrest gamblers Huang Genda, Gu Shaoquan, Shi Xiaogou, Lu Laosi, Zhang Yongsheng and others in Maoshengli, Zhoushanbang. Except for two people who were released, the rest were sentenced to detention. At about 4:00 a.m. on the 24th, the gamblers and the petty thief Wang You and others escaped by digging a hole in the wall of the detention center while the guards were asleep. It was too late when they were discovered. The incident was immediately reported to Section Chief Duan Qishan, who forwarded the report to the Public Security Bureau for verification and investigation. Police officers were sent to investigate and arrest the fugitives for interrogation.</p>

<p>The labor-capital dispute case of Qing Yu Tang Chinese Medicine Shop in Hangzhou City has been mediated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce again and again, but without success. The Construction Department has ordered the municipal government to investigate and deal with the case because the shop assistants have joined the trade union. It is now known that the municipal government has investigated the truth and formulated a solution, which is: (1) Since the shop assistants have joined the trade association, they should withdraw from the trade union; (2) Manager Yu Xiu reinstated; (3) No reduction in salary or dismissal of workers. It is said that the labor and management parties will be ordered to comply. It is said that the labor party has sent representatives to Shanghai to report to the shareholders' meeting and request a meeting to resolve the issue.</p>

Therefore, they have gathered together to discuss and request a review. The Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association has telegraphed the National Government, requesting a delay in the promulgation. The original telegram has also been disclosed in various newspapers. The association has also telegraphed the Central Political Committee, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior to make the same request, in order to carry out the proposal of a review. The three telegrams are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Central Political Committee</p>
<p>Central Political Review Committee: The Publishing Law revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan on Wenri has a great relationship to culture, but there are many obstacles to its implementation.

<p>Central News Agency said that Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, accompanied President Wang to Qingdao for recuperation on the 15th of this month. He returned to Beijing a few days ago. At 11:00 p.m. the night before, he took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai. He arrived at the North Station at 7:15 a.m. yesterday. He went directly to the Franco-Chinese Institute on Lafayette Road to meet with Vice-President Xue Fan to discuss school affairs. Then he accompanied Xue Fan to the Huishan Wharf to take the Shanghai Maru to Japan to escape the summer heat. It was not until 9:00 a.m. that he returned to his private residence on Albert Road to rest. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, visited Chu at about 10:00 a.m. to inquire about President Wang's condition and talked for an hour before leaving. Chu is scheduled to take the night train back to Beijing at 11:00 p.m. that night. According to Chu, President Wang's condition, until he left Qingdao, his fever gradually decreased, the inflammation slightly subsided, and the number of white blood cells also decreased. However, his body was unusually thin, but it is gratifying that his spirit was quite good. Judging from the current situation, he needs to recuperate in Qingdao for six weeks. As for surgery, it can be avoided because President Wang suffers from diabetes, and it is feared that it will not be easy to close the wound after surgery. I am scheduled to attend a sports discussion meeting in Qingdao on the 1st and 2nd of next month to give a speech, so I decided to go to Qingdao at the end of the month to visit President Wang's condition. Dr. Noel is still in Qingdao and will return to Shanghai after President Wang recovers. Chairman Huang Shaoxiong went to Qingdao this time to pay a visit to President Wang to discuss political affairs. In addition to allocating funds for disaster relief, the Central Government has decided to organize patrol medical teams to prevent epidemics in the disaster areas.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, domestic goods manufacturers in this city, recognizing past deficiencies in their products and sluggish sales, have recently been striving to improve the quality and durability of their goods.  They are also contacting merchants to expand sales.  Over the past few months, their business situation has greatly improved.  Industry leaders are now selecting specialists to travel to various regions to negotiate sales methods. Simultaneously, they are establishing contracts with merchants in border provinces to actively promote sales. Currently, domestic goods companies have been established in major cities of Shanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces.  The general population in these border regions has a considerable appreciation for the low price and high quality of domestic goods. According to industry insiders, sales of domestic goods in border provinces have been increasing monthly for several months. Therefore, manufacturers are happily dispatching goods for sale.  At the same time, some manufacturers with stronger capital bases, noting that tens of thousands of overseas Chinese reside in French-controlled Vietnam following the signing of the Sino-French-Vietnamese agreement, all enthusiastically support and use domestic goods. Therefore, they plan to jointly establish a company to transport and sell goods there.</p>

<p>According to the Shin Shi News Agency, the International Trade Bureau, in order to investigate national industries, is sending personnel to conduct on-site surveys. Secretary Zhu Jingxuan was first dispatched to Shanxi to make initial arrangements. The full team of survey specialists, including Lu Guoxiang, Jiang Fu, Jiang Xuekai, Yang Zhujun, Ma Jibo, Xie Ze, and eight others, departed from Shanghai yesterday afternoon to conduct the investigation. Shanxi Province has a total of one hundred and five counties, which the Bureau has divided into eight districts. The first district, including Yangqu, Taiyuan, and thirteen other counties, will be surveyed by specialist Lu Guoxiang. The second district, including Pinding, Xin County, and thirteen other counties, will be surveyed by Jiang Xuekai. The third district, including Datong, Hunyuan, and thirteen other counties, will be surveyed by Ma Jibo. The fourth district, including Changzhi, Jin City, and thirteen other counties, will be surveyed by Xie Ze. The fifth district, including Xiaoyi, Hongtong, and fourteen other counties, will be surveyed by Yao Ren.

<h3 id="e108">International Wireless Telephone Expected to Open by Year-End; All Application Devices Now Installed; Trial Calls and Contract Negotiations Underway <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>After the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was ordered to prepare for international wireless telephone service, the Wireless Radio Station Engineering Company has completed the installation of all terminal and secret devices. According to Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, although the international wireless telephone equipment has been installed, they are currently conducting trial calls with Japan, England, and Manila. International calls are quite complex, unlike simple telegrams, so the preparations will take time. The Jingdian Transmission that it would start operating on the 15th of next month may not be so rapid in reality. It is expected that official opening can only be achieved at the end of the year. The Ministry of Communications and the Telecommunications Bureau are separately conducting contract negotiations with various countries regarding the signing of telephone agreements. Detailed methods have been drafted regarding the number of calls, prices, and national zoning methods, and submitted to the Ministry of Communications for review. When official calls begin, they will start in the Zhabei area of Shanghai and gradually expand to the entire city and other locations, such as Nanjing, Beiping, Suzhou, and Wuxi. This international call is similar to making a long-distance call. For example, if Mr. A in Shanghai wants to call Mr. B in Japan, Mr. A only needs to report his telephone number and the address and telephone number to the Telecommunications Bureau. The Telecommunications Bureau will immediately connect the line, allowing Mr. A and Mr. B to speak directly. Therefore, the equipment used is closely related to the telephone bureaus in those locations. In order to simplify and speed up the calling process, the Telecommunications Bureau is striving for thoroughness in all preparations beforehand, to achieve a lasting solution.</p>

<p>The Hui Chang vessel, belonging to the Shanghai Huitong Company, was transporting goods to Ningbo from Pukou. On the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, at 1:00 PM, when departing from Pukou, it collided with the Hua Shun vessel of the Shanghai Huasheng Shipping Company. The Hui Chang vessel sustained damage to the outer hull of its third hold. The shipowner telegraphed Shanghai to report the incident, stating, "Hui Chang's third hold was breached by the Hua Shun vessel."  A subsequent telegram stated, "…" Upon receiving the report, Huitong Company immediately dispatched clerk Lu Huichuan to Nanjing that evening, then on to Pukou, to conduct an on-site inspection and seek a resolution. Lu telegraphed the company, stating that the damage to the Hui Chang vessel caused by the Hua Shun vessel was located on the right side of the third hold, about fifteen feet in length above the waterline, eight feet high, with the deepest indentation about four inches. There was a slight leak below the waterline.</p>
<p>Hua Shun Damaged: The Huasheng Company's Hua Shun vessel also departed from the Pukou dock on the same day. Before the eighth gangway, it collided with the Hui Chang. The captain's report, forwarded to Shanghai by the Huasheng Nanjing agency, stated, in brief, that the Hua Shun vessel was struck head-on by the Huitong Xing Hui Chang vessel when leaving the Pukou dock at 1:02 PM on the 22nd, causing significant damage to the Hua Shun's bow. Detailed circumstances will be reported in full by shipowner Klopp, and will be forwarded to the insurance company as a basis for negotiation.</p>
<p>Temporary Repairs: Because there were no public notaries available in Pukou to verify the leak in the outer hull of the Hui Chang vessel's third hold, Lu Huichuan consulted with and obtained the Hui Chang captain's agreement to temporarily fill the leak with cement, so the vessel could proceed to Ningbo before returning to Shanghai for inspection. Whether there is internal damage to the hull due to the impact will only be clear after inspection in Shanghai. A damage report has been issued to the Huitong Company regarding the damage to the Huasheng vessel's bow for their review.</p>
<p>Notice to All Parties: Yesterday, both Huitong and Huasheng companies sent notices to the China United Ship Insurance Association, which insures their vessels, regarding the collision for their reference. The issue of liability will be determined after both vessels arrive in Shanghai and undergo inspection. It is currently too early to determine who is at fault.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee hosted a tea reception for the press at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Wang Yansong delivered a speech explaining the committee's mission and significance. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Qu Shao Yi, Jin Hua Ting, Sun Dao Sheng of Shen Bao; Shen Ji Cang of Xin Wen Bao; Xue Nong Shan of Shi Shi Xin Bao; He Xi Ya of Chen Bao; Qian Cang Shuo, Guan Jiu An, Wu Zhong Yi of Min Bao; Zhang Zhi Han of Da Mei Wan Bao, and over ten others. Chairman Wang Yansong was accompanied by the committee's Director of General Affairs Yan Esheng, and Executive Director Ren Jinpin, who provided refreshments.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Yansong said in his speech, "The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, recognizing the severity of the economic panic and the close relationship between industry, commerce, and the economy, deeply understands that in order to resist the attack of the economic panic, it must aid the declining industry and commerce, enabling them to fulfill their duty to save the country and strive for self-reliance. Therefore, the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee was organized, and I was entrusted with the responsibility of serving as its chairman. I recognize that I am not qualified for the task, but I dare not shrink from difficulty. We have now hired industry leaders and experts to serve as committee members, hoping to cooperate and jointly seek effective remedies. We have now, based on the original proposal, investigated the causes of industrial and commercial decline, studied the principles of revival plans, and formulated a preliminary work process. The investigation team will first conduct investigative work, and then the statistics team will analyze the investigation materials. Then, together with experts, we will study the revival plan and pay attention to training so that assistance from the government and all sectors can be guided. However, to achieve this goal, industry and commerce leaders and owners must cooperate and provide practical assistance. Otherwise, the investigation results may not obtain genuine materials, and the true cause and crux of industrial and commercial decline will not be revealed. I am deeply afraid that even if we encounter a famous doctor with a passion for treating the illness, he will be unable to prescribe medicine because the patient avoids seeking medical attention, or there is a danger of prescribing the wrong medicine. Considering this, I cannot but sincerely expect the public opinion circles to provide strong assistance, guiding colleagues on the one hand, and alerting industrialists and merchants on the other, so that the planning for industrial and commercial revival will not become a mere formality to cope with the environment. Today, the government attaches great importance to the problem of rescuing declining industry and commerce. If there is a concrete and reasonable rescue plan, they will be happy to provide assistance. We must not forget that at the beginning of the 1911 Revolution, the first telegram sent by President Sun Yat-sen from overseas encouraged the people to value industry and commerce. Examining the purpose of various competitions and wars between nations in the world, we find that it lies in the economy. Therefore, whether we want to resist economic attacks or build economic production, we must value industry and commerce, because industry and commerce are weapons for resisting economic attacks and tools for building economic production. Everyone who studies world history today knows that the source of England's wealth and strength lies in its good use of commercial policies. This can be seen in the statistics of England's foreign wars, in which the pursuit of maritime rights and commercial rights is particularly prominent. Although I have not conducted research on the motivation for England's adoption of commercial policies, I speculate that the British must have estimated the results of their initial land productivity and realized that it was insufficient to support the lives of their people, plan their political and military construction, and become strong in the world. Therefore, they vigorously implemented commercial policies to attract foreign economies to support the application of raising the people and repairing political armies. Turning to Japan, we see that its emphasis on commerce seems to have been after the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Looking at its journey to wealth and strength, it is exactly the same as England. This further proves the importance of the relationship between commerce and national people's livelihood. Today, we all know the pain of national suffering, and everyone has a heart to relieve the country's difficulties. Therefore, industrialists and merchants, for themselves and for the country, should detail the source of the disease in order to seek reasonable assistance, so that each organization can gradually become healthy and can unite with each other to jointly resist economic attacks and strive for the construction of economic production, so that national strength and people's livelihood can benefit from both. Therefore, today, in addition to representing my colleagues to thank you for braving the heat to attend, I also ask you to use the power of public opinion to make industrialists and merchants deeply understand the importance of this investigation and give sincere assistance."</p>
<p>Press Response</p>
<p>He Xiya stood up to respond on behalf of the press, stating that although various parties have paid attention to rescuing industry and commerce in the past, they have only seen words and no effective measures, causing industry and commerce to be deeply suspicious. Now the City Chamber of Commerce has this organization, which starts with investigation, statistics, research, and training, and focuses on practical work. The press is closely related to industry and commerce, so it is very pleased and dares to do its best to assist the committee.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Hu Xiyuan of Lakeside Garden Contributes Opinions on Reviving Industry and Commerce; Response that Starting with Training is Too Slow, and Fundamental Relief Must Increase Capital <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan, General Manager of Yapu Er Electrical Factory and member of the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee of the City Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter to the Revival Committee yesterday, contributing his opinions on reviving industry and commerce, stating that the decline of industry and commerce in our country is the only difficulty in national revival, because the economy is the lifeline of a modern country. The whole country, the government, and the public, recognizing the importance of this issue, are anxiously considering how to revive it. The Shanghai City is the economic center of the country, and the City Chamber of Commerce is the leading organization for industry and commerce. The planning and response for</p>
<p>Reviving Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>should naturally be the focus of attention of Chinese and foreign people. Since the establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee, all of you have not avoided difficulties and have taken on this important task. Although your perseverance is commendable, the methods of starting with investigating the content of factories and shops and training managers and employees are good in their intention to find the source and seek the root, but they are time-consuming and too slow to address the urgent need. The current situation of industry and commerce in our country is like extreme anemia, on the verge of death. Doctors should first save the emergency, inject cardiotonics to protect its spirit, and transfuse a large amount of blood to cultivate its foundation so that the patient can be slightly awakened. Then, conditioning and nourishing can cure the disease, and further relaxing the muscles and bones can increase the role of metabolism and prepare for outdoor exercise to build healthy muscles. Doctors do not do this but instead</p>
<p>On the Verge of Death</p>
<p>for people to do such a thing as giving advice, how to do deep breathing and soft exercises. The world is no big deal. If this patient is driven to a dangerous experiment, then the spirit is not guaranteed, and there is no such thing as a fatal cause. The deep breathing and soft exercises, although not the cause of death, are actually the result of fatal events. Why is this? Since the national industry and commerce concluded with the great result of last year, for half a year, the self-advocacy and the government authorities of calm tranquility, how to do it today, how to achieve success, is clear in people's ears and eyes, and the exhaustion of industry and commerce is becoming more and more acute. Can the committee fulfill its wishes to first survey industry and commerce, namely and the results are remarkable, if there is no economic support, then how to start? The current national place, with the economic destruction of the world powers and the economic剥, resulting in the outflow of silver and the exhaustion of cash, is now the cash chip, and with my country's naive industry and commerce, there is no way to get rid of the bondage of advanced countries, then the outflow of cash chips is still an inevitable fact, then my country in the future, only this only remaining cash chip, as a supply of national defense and</p>
<p>Economic Construction</p>
<p>necessary needs, and another method of replacing cash chips, the nationwide chaos is poor, the relief of the rural areas must be chips. The revival of industry and commerce must be chips. All the construction projects, without one without the need for chips. Sufficient chips, then a hundred industries are prosperous, and vice versa, there is no fading away. According to the current situation, the financial sector's embrace of self-consolidation and the government's calm tranquility are not to be saved by the lack of industrial and commercial decline, and the people's hardship is not enough to be concerned about, and there is a lack of cash chips and no way to open this difficult situation. The best plan for today is not to save the Chinese economy, and if you want to save the Chinese economy, increasing chips is a good medicine for the right symptoms, and the revival of industry and commerce should be based on the interests of the entire nation, starting from the big picture, focusing on the near, not being obscured by the views of one party, and not being limited to the selfishness of one industry, and wandering on the branch of the road, hesitating to watch. Attitude, agile and decisive means, identified</p>
<p>Increase Chips</p>
<p>is the only way to build a people-friendly economy, quickly gather wisdom, discuss methods together, present them to the government, and urge them to implement them, so that the only remaining vitality can be preserved, and the desire for revival can be expected, and then other reorganization steps, this is not an easy way, otherwise, confined to prejudice, each seeking self-sufficiency, there is no different from the end, Xiyuan is a revival committee member, self-ashamed of his lack of strength, in his own business, there is no revival of good strategy, and reluctantly with the others to join the ranks of the revival committee, sweating extremely, but since the establishment of the revival committee, although only two weeks, and the national industry and commerce belong to the note of the殷, the longing is sharp, there is no non-thinking, Xiyuan, although滥竽充数, and the letters and telegrams from all parties to ask questions and opinions, there have been many, the pain is so important, there is no way to answer, secretly afraid of the long term of this factor, the upper and lower makeup, seeking the policy of revival, is not more than to climb trees for fish, and even if there are ten or two methods, and the national industry and commerce, has already entered the dry fish. For this reason, I will not try to be simple and present it wildly. Is there anything wrong with it? I also pray for the committee members to consider it in public.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, due to the recent market downturn, proposed to reduce the salaries of crew members earning over fifty yuan by 20% across the board, effective from July 1st. This matter has caused a backlash from crew members. However, the Shipping Industry Association believes that the salary reduction must be implemented and submitted the agreed-upon temporary salary reduction measures for crew members to the Ministry of Communications for filing. It is now known that the Ministry's reply has arrived in Shanghai, stating in brief, "The submission has been noted. The case concerns labor-capital contracts, which can be handled through negotiations without the need to submit to the Ministry for filing. This is for your information."</p>

<p>After the six companies' public tonnage contract was established, each company's business will be publicly set a discount to show fairness and to ensure uniformity, so as to avoid private acts such as unauthorized commission release. The agreed-upon discount, according to the results of the representatives' previous discussions, whether shipping to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other ports, will be charged at 90% of the tariff rate. In addition to giving a customs broker a 9% commission, the other six companies will all release another 9% commission. Only the Rijii Company requested to release an additional 8.5% commission. The five companies were forced to agree, so the Japanese ships exclusively occupy the advantage.</p>
<p>Problems with Customs Broker Industry</p>
<p>After the implementation of public tonnage, the surface does not涨水脚, but in fact, the original five or six扣佣 released by the individual companies is abolished, and only one stipulated nine deduction commission can be obtained. Only at that time, the six companies each had a special customs broker to report the goods of the bureau, and after the public攤, each other can互装. Last month, there was a claim to organize a customs cooperative, which was later opposed by a general小報关行, and was therefore not realized, and the proposal to limit qualifications was put forward. The method is to investigate the past business of each customs firm, and those with a water foot of 60,000 yuan in a year are first class, those with 30,000 yuan are second class, those with 10,000 yuan are third class, and those with less than 10,000 yuan are unqualified. The general小報关行 heard about it, and was greatly alarmed, which led to the dispute, and the 杂粮帮报关行, etc., due to the lack of procedures to comply, asked to delay for a few days, but the six companies rejected their request.</p>
<p>Shipping Costs After Public Tonnage</p>
<p>From today onwards, the implementation of the public摊, regardless of the upper and lower water cargo, as well as the Yangtze River transit cargo, will be included in the public攤account calculation. The shipping costs agreed upon by the six companies in the public deliberation, roughly from Shanghai 装船, to Hankou and other ports of cargo, based on the number of unit digits, is set to Zhenjiang per ton for six yuan one corner and a half, to Nanjing for eight yuan two corner, to Wuhu for nine yuan two corner, to Jiujiang, and Hankou for eleven yuan six corner and a half, and according to the weight of the jin, to Zhenjiang per ton six yuan five cents, to Nanjing eight yuan five cents, to Wuhu nine yuan five cents, to Jiujiang Hankou for eleven yuan four corner five cents, such as sugar 疋头, cotton yarn, cigarettes, flour, kelp, paper, hardware, cement, and other special rates, and the rest are calculated according to the current tariff.</p>
<p>Determination to Implement from Today</p>
<p>The six companies' river ships and barges have been hired by the company to inspect the ships in batches, and the cargo capacity of each ship is listed as a publicly recognized ton, which is the basis for the public摊standard. Other formalities are also being rushed to completion. The six companies have yesterday telegraphed each port 分行 of Zhen, Ning, Wu, Xun, Han, Sha, Yi, that from the 25th, all the goods loaded and assembled shall be included in the public摊water feet, and all the previous special commissions, rebates, etc., shall be abolished. The specialized accounting office of Thomson, which they hired, also began to work from today.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reports that He Fu, the liquidator of the American Feng Bank, previously filed a lawsuit with the United States Court in China at the end of June, seeking to recover from Lei Wenzeng, the bank's general manager, a bonus of 135,000 taels granted by the bank's board of directors on January 13, 1932, plus interest. Yesterday, He Fu supplemented his complaint, stating that Lei Wenzeng had received a huge salary before receiving this bonus. From June 1, 1928, to December 31, 1929, he received a monthly salary of 750 yuan. In 1930, he received a monthly salary of 1,000 yuan for the entire year, and at the end of the year, he also received a bonus of 1,800 yuan. Therefore, the bank should not have given Lei Wenzeng a bonus. Lei Wenzeng should immediately return the 135,000 taels he received in fairness and conscience. Moreover, when the board of directors voted to grant the bonus and Lei Wenzeng received it, the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Lei Wenzeng also knew that it was about to go bankrupt. In addition to suing for the 135,000 taels granted to Lei Wenzeng by the American Feng Bank, He Fu is also seeking to recover bonuses of 135,000 taels each granted to Lei Wenzeng by the American East Bank Company and the Puyi Real Estate Company. Lei Wenzeng has not yet filed a statement of defense. Once it is filed, the case will be scheduled for trial.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying Reports from Shanghai on Inspection of Hunan Disaster; Says Wang Yilao and Other Senior Generals Should Be Aware: Successive telegrams report the disaster situation, estimated to reach near and far. Your younger brother Yangwu arrived in Changsha, inquired in detail about the severity of the Hunan disaster, and together with Director Yu Jichuan of the Hunan Relief Department, prepared at 7:00 AM to inspect the disaster along the Xiang River, from Xiang Yanliu's Linci Port to Baimasi Hanci Tuan and other places. Most of the dikes had collapsed, and the water had receded several feet in recent days, but the flatlands were still more than ten to twenty feet deep. The water level was higher than in the twentieth year of the Republic. All the crops were submerged, and replanting was impossible. In addition, the disaster situation in lakeside counties such as Yuanjiang, Nanxian, Shou'an Township, Lixian, Changde, and Yiyang was even more severe. As for Cili, Shimen, and Linfeng in western Hunan, it was reported that in early July, they suffered devastating mountain floods, which rose to a depth of forty to fifty feet in an instant, inundating cities and villages, and sweeping away people and livestock. Although the water receded quickly, the disaster was as cruel as that in Tianmen and Hanchuan in Hubei. The Hunan Flood Relief General Association is coordinating relief efforts. Shiying returned to Changsha that evening and transferred to Hubei by special train. Further details will be reported later. Xu Shiying kowtows, Yang.</p>
<p>Reports Received by the Red Swastika Society: The Shanghai General Office of the Society has successively received detailed reports from the Wuhu and Anqing branches regarding the situation of salvaging bodies along the river. The following is a summary to inform those concerned about disaster relief: (1) Respectfully addressed to the United General Office of the Chinese Southeast Branches of the World Red Swastika Society. The electric telegram has been received and understood. We were deeply saddened to hear of the tragic disaster in Tianmen and other counties. Kai Rang and Zhi Dao immediately supervised the staff and hired two large rowing boats, carrying salvage equipment, to search along the river. The next morning, they recovered many unidentified corpses at Sihushan and immediately buried them on the spot. Due to the rapid river flow, salvage was difficult. The next day, they hired a new Shengli steamboat, towing several rowing boats, carrying food, coffins, and reed mats. The two branch presidents, Li Kairang and Chen Yuannan, supervised the team members Tang Yuanding and others, as well as more than ten laborers. They set sail at 3:00 PM that afternoon, going up from Datong and down to Dongxi Liangshan, rotating weekly, and doing their best to salvage bodies to prevent the spread of epidemics caused by rotting corpses. A detailed report will be sent again once the ship returns to Wuhu. Wuhu Red Swastika Society kowtows, Ma. (1) Addressed to the Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society. Your electric telegram has been respectfully received and understood. It is our duty to salvage and bury the corpses drowned in the Tianmen and Gucheng floods that are flowing downstream to prevent epidemics, and we will comply. We have immediately notified the boatmen along the river and the life-saving bureaus to salvage any floating corpses coming downstream. This office will provide coffins for burial and reward the corpse-salvaging boatmen according to the number of bodies salvaged. Work is now being carried out separately. This office is also sending personnel to patrol and negotiate at any time. Anqing Office, Ma. (1) Furthermore, Mr. Bian Xiaoqing, Chairman of the Nanjing Datong Flour Company, yesterday contacted the Society and generously offered to donate 1,000 bags of flour to relieve the flood disaster in Hubei Province. He also agreed to reduce the price of each bag by four yuan when the Society purchases flour from the company, up to a limit of 6,000 bags. Someone like Mr. Bian can be said to be wholeheartedly engaged in relief efforts.</p>
<p>Urgent Telegrams Received by the Sino-Foreign Relief Society: The Sino-Foreign Relief Society on Renlu Road has been receiving reports like snowflakes from the disaster-stricken provinces along the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in recent days. The various tragic situations are unbearable to hear and have been compiled and published in previous reports. Now the Society has received urgent telegrams about the floods in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Shandong, which are specially recorded below: (1) The Joint Association of the Hankou City Chamber of Commerce and the Hubei Provincial Chamber of Commerce telegraphed, saying, "This year, during the summer flood season, continuous rain has caused disasters, and floods have erupted. Recently, the Yangtze and Han rivers have risen simultaneously, and the dikes along the banks have collapsed. In particular, Xiangyang and Fancheng in the upper reaches of the Han River have suffered price reductions. The water is ten feet high, and people are like fish. The Han, Mian, Tian, and Qian areas have become a watery country. Hundreds of thousands of residents have been swept away by the floods and have died. The sight of corpses is heartbreaking. The existing dikes are all in imminent danger and are being reinforced day and night, but it is still difficult to escape danger. Even if they can survive, it will only be a corner of safety, while the disaster is extremely severe, surpassing that of the twentieth year of the Republic. We earnestly request relief." (1) The Xihang Chamber of Commerce of Hubei Zhijiang sent a telegram on behalf of the Zhijiang County, saying, "Zhijiang County is located on the Yangtze River, and the city is the dike. Suddenly, on the song day of this month, mountain floods and torrential rain occurred. Rescue was not possible, resulting in the collapse of the city walls and the inundation of houses. Most of them collapsed, and the goods of merchants and residents were swept away. This unprecedented disaster is heartbreaking. We have long admired your society's concern for the hungry and drowning and earnestly request your swift assistance." (1) The Jiangxi Ruichang County Flood Relief Committee sent a telegram on behalf of the county, saying, "Since late June, continuous rain has been falling in this county, and mountain floods have erupted. The river water has been flowing backward, and it has been rising even more recently, surpassing the disaster situation of the twentieth year of the Republic. People have been climbing onto the roofs to escape by boat, and livestock and halls have been swept away by the waves, cutting off all means of livelihood. Selling children and daughters is common. The cries of refugees are everywhere, and Zheng Xia cannot draw a picture. We humbly request that you bestow your kindness early and distribute relief grain frequently." (1) The representatives of the disaster areas of Shandong Juan, Yun, He, and Ju counties telegraphed, saying, "Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the counties of Juan, Yun, He, and Ju in Shandong have repeatedly suffered Yellow River disasters, especially this year's disaster is the most severe. On the tenth of this month, the Yellow River suddenly breached its banks at Zhuang in Juan County, flowing eastward through the counties of Juan, Yun, He, and Ju. The area it passed through is still the area that was affected by the previous six disasters. The waves are turbulent, and in one day and night, hundreds of miles were flooded. Hundreds of villages have disappeared, with depths exceeding ten feet. The halls have been swept away, and countless people and livestock have drowned. The cries of grief are everywhere, and all the people are victims of the waves. They are suffering from hunger and cold, and the survivors do not know what to do. In addition, continuous rain is adding to the disaster, with torrential rain falling repeatedly. The god of wind is stubborn, often stirring up huge waves. They are exposed to the rain and wind, and their faces are thin and haggard. The situation is tragic and unbearable to witness. If relief is not provided quickly, the millions of disaster victims who have not yet died will all be abandoned in the gullies. We have long known that your society is charitable and cares for the hungry and drowning. We implore you to generously donate funds and jointly undertake this righteous cause, or send personnel to provide relief and save these survivors."</p>
<p>Report Recently Received by the Jinan Provincial Assembly: Guo Fangwu of the Henan Provincial Relief Association recently reported to the Chinese Jinsheng Association that on the morning of July 15, he took a train to Yanshi to inspect the flood disaster. After getting off the train, he went to the temporary office of the county government in Yaocun, north of the city, and met with the county magistrate and relief personnel. Then, together with Chen Ziming, the vice president of the relief association, and Guo Wenrun, the director of the education bureau, he braved the rain to climb the city wall. He walked from the north gate of the city wall to the east gate and then returned to the northwest breach, unable to proceed further. Inside the city, there was a vast expanse of water, which had become a lake. The shallow areas were still more than ten feet deep, and the deep areas were more than twenty feet deep. Compared to the initial rise, the water had receded by more than ten feet. All the houses had collapsed, leaving only a few old brick buildings. The remaining broken walls and wood were scattered everywhere. The stench of human and animal corpses and the smell of rotten buds were nauseating. It was reported that the rise of the Yi and Luo rivers occurred at dawn on the eighth day. The officials and gentry were guarding the south dike, but then they heard that there was danger in the northeast and went to reinforce it, but it was ultimately ineffective. At 1:00 PM, the dike collapsed, and the floodwater entered the city through the two northeast gates. On the southwest side, the dike also collapsed, and the water poured into the city through the four gates. Residents did not have time to escape and either climbed onto the roofs or clung to tree branches, crying for help. The old and weak were swept away, or they were crushed by the collapsing houses, or their corpses floated on the water. According to the household registration, there were 4,364 households in the city, and now 1,207 households are missing, 157 households have been swept away, 67 bodies with names have been found, and hundreds of bodies without names have been found. More than 12,000 refugees have escaped, sleeping in the open air on the crumbling city walls, the moat embankments, and the foothills of Beimang Mountain, without clothes or food, sick and waiting to die. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. During this flood, County Magistrate Yang of the county led the personnel of various agencies to run around to reinforce the dikes, refusing to leave first, and finally floated out of the water on a piece of wood, calling on the villagers to build rafts to save people. This spirit of sacrifice is admirable. The disaster in the rural areas of the county and in the villages south of the city and in the third and fourth districts is the most severe. In addition, the villages of Dai Su, Luozhuang, Jiong Juanzhen, Xiaoyi Dongzhan, and the villages near the Luo River in Yanshi and Kunlian counties are also extremely tragic. All of this was heard during this trip, but due to road blockages and mud up to the knees, it was not possible to visit all the places. This tragic disaster is unprecedented in a hundred years. In this extremely difficult time of need, all of you great benefactors, if you can vow to provide relief, the number of disaster victims saved will be countless. How can the merits be limited? The blessings will surely be boundless.</p>
<p>The Hubei Native Place Association Received a Telegram from the Provincial Government: The Hubei Native Place Association received a telegram from the Hubei Provincial Government, which read, "To Director Wu Xingya of Shanghai, and to Guan Jiongzhi, Gao Jianqing, Liu Wanqing, and Liu Qiangfu, may all the gentlemen be aware. Since the beginning of summer in Hubei, the cities and villages have all been flooded. Wuhan alone, thanks to rescue efforts, has not collapsed. In addition, all the prosperous rural areas and the bustling commercial and industrial cities in the province have been submerged in the torrential floods. The loss of cotton alone is more than one hundred million. Since the floods of the twentieth year of the Republic, disasters have been reported every year. Last year, we encountered a drought, and this year we have suffered a flood. The height of this year's flood and the extent of the disaster area are even greater than previous records. The government's resources are exhausted, and the people's reserves are also depleted. The survivors are stretching their necks and waiting for food. Relief cannot be delayed. Gentlemen, with your concern for your homeland, we believe you will provide assistance. We respectfully request you to generously donate large sums of money or to widely raise funds to alleviate this disaster. We are deeply grateful. Zhang Ling, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Meng Guangpeng, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Flood Relief General Association, and all the members kowtow together."</p>

<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that several dozen leaders of the Shanghai business community, including Wang Yiting, believe that due to the lack of silver reserves in the country and the increasingly sophisticated financial manipulation by the great powers, China's situation is difficult and requires fundamental reform to cope with it. Yesterday, Wang told the Xinsheng News Agency reporter that the current state of economic decline in China is extremely dangerous. The foundation of a country is the people. If the foundation of the people is shaken, how can the country stand? As a businessman, I express my views and submit proposals for reform to the authorities, requesting them to set concrete solutions as soon as possible to strengthen the foundation of the people. It is said that the Executive Yuan has adopted Wang's proposal and ordered it to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and research.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Care About the Motherland; Promote Culture and Invest in Industry <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Industry News Agency reports that the Vietnam Chinese Business Economic Federation, in order to promote the culture of the motherland and enlighten the knowledge of overseas Chinese, has established the Kuanglu Library in Vietnam and plans to build industries in the motherland, organize industrial inspection groups, and hold national product exhibitions. Yesterday, they sent a special letter to Huang Jianzhong of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese United Association Organizing Committee to plan and implement these activities. According to Huang Jianzhong, a reporter from the Industry News Agency said that he had received a letter from Yan Zihuan, chairman of the Vietnam Chinese Business Economic Federation, stating that the overseas Chinese there had established the Kuanglu Library to promote the culture of the motherland and had remitted funds to Shanghai to purchase books. He (Huang) had ordered the Wanyou Library and other books from the Commercial Press and had also collected various valuable books from various bookstores for reference in studying the culture of the motherland. At the same time, the library, in response to the National Language Promotion Association and to unify the language, has established a National Language Training Institute and lecture halls to train talents. The overseas Chinese there, in view of the fact that the flowers often arise in various places, and living under the eaves of others is not a good strategy in the end, have established an Industrial Promotion Association. The purpose of the association is purely to promote investment in the motherland. It has issued a declaration to raise capital and proceed in stages. The first step in the plan is to organize an industrial inspection group to return to the country to establish industries. Jiangxi has been designated as the destination because Jiangxi is adjacent to Fujian and Guangdong, which is beneficial for immigration. Huang is paying close attention to this matter. In addition to collecting industrial materials from Jiangxi for reference, he is also planning to submit a written opinion on how to contribute. Since the promulgation of the Sino-French Vietnam Agreement, Sino-Vietnamese trade will tend to develop day by day. The overseas Chinese there are very happy and have recommended Yan Zihuan to propose to the Chamber of Commerce to prepare a national product exhibition. Three methods were decided on the spot: (1) First, prepare for the exhibition, send a letter to the Overseas Chinese United Association and the National National Product United Association to collect new product samples from domestic factories and transport them to Vietnam for public exhibition, so as to arouse the interest of overseas Chinese in adopting national products. (2) When transporting the exhibits, request the resident government to specify the tax rate for each item and postpone taxation. After the exhibition, those suitable for sale in Vietnam will be taxed according to the tax rate. (3) For various national products, if it is considered that they can be promoted in Vietnam, a large-scale national product company should be organized immediately to increase sales strength. They are currently discussing methods with Wang Hanqiang and others from the National Product Maintenance Association.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Directorate General of Posts Submits to the Ministry to Suspend the Mailing of Sugar Powder and Coffee Essence; Although Various Items Have Been Tested and Found to Be Non-Toxic, They Are Materials for Preparing Drugs <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts, due to the fact that parcels of sugar powder, coffee essence, caffeine, lactose, etc., sent from Shanghai to the interior have been detained by local governments from time to time, has specially requested the Ministry of Communications to temporarily suspend the mailing of the above-mentioned parcels. The original report stated, "Regarding the case of mailing parcels of sugar powder, coffee essence, etc., in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang and Henan Management Bureaus successively reported that local authorities had confiscated parcels of sugar powder, which were raw materials for manufacturing the drug 'Hongwan,' and had confiscated them. Samples were sent to the Shanghai Management Bureau for transfer to the Customs for testing, and they were found not to contain any toxic substances and were not on the list of prohibited items. It was then reported and instructed that since the Customs had tested and proved that they did not contain toxic substances, they should be allowed to be received and mailed as usual for the convenience of merchants, and the governments of Zhejiang and Henan provinces should be notified to check and comply. In the tenth year of the same year, it was reported by the Shanxi Management Bureau that parcels of saccharin powder in the Shanxi area were detained in accordance with the measures of the Shanxi Provincial Government to prohibit the trafficking and manufacturing of 'Jindan' raw materials. The Ministry then consulted the Opium Prohibition Committee as to whether this saccharin powder was a raw material for manufacturing drugs and whether it should be allowed to be mailed. Later, it was instructed to send a letter from the Opium Prohibition Committee to the Ministry of Interior's Health Department for delivery to the Central Hygiene Laboratory for testing. According to the report, the test results showed that it did not contain drugs. The main ingredients of 'Jindan' and 'Baiwan' were morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other narcotics. Saccharin starch was a shaping drug and could be dispensable. If morphine, cocaine, heroin, etc., can be completely banned from import, then saccharin starch can be banned without prohibition. Please check and order the relevant authorities to be notified. In October of the twenty-second year, it was reported by the Henan Management Bureau that a parcel sent from Shanghai to Anyang was detained by the Anyang County Government as a prohibited item. The Shanghai Management Bureau was immediately ordered to investigate and found that it was sent by the Da Zhongxi Pharmacy, containing coffee essence. According to the Customs, coffee essence is a Western medicine material, and the regulations are for treating cold and fever. They are not on the list of prohibited items. The bureau was immediately ordered to notify the relevant authorities. Subsequently, it was reported that the Anyang County Government had also sent it to the County Hospital for testing and found that it did not contain any toxic substances. It was returned to the recipient in full. Therefore, the post office has been receiving and mailing parcels of saccharin and coffee essence as usual. Recently, it has been reported by the Henan Management Bureau that in the twenty-third year, eleven parcels of lactose sent from Tianjin to Wuji Town, Wu'an, were confiscated by the Wu'an County Government. In addition, several parcels of coffee essence sent from Shanghai to Anyang were confiscated by the Anyang County Government. Recently, the Anyang County Government detained a cash-on-delivery parcel sent from Shanghai to Anyang. After inquiry, it was said that it contained two tubes of 'Jianqiang Kui' silver, two tubes of coffee essence, three bottles of 'Shidine,' and five bottles of 'Nuo Jiaco Yin,' which were all necessary for compounding drugs. Later, a letter was received stating that the Henan Provincial Government had instructed that they should be confiscated and burned. They hoped for investigation and so on. The bureau has always paid great attention to investigating and prohibiting the mailing of prohibited items. If there are suspicious parcels, the court or the competent authorities are notified at any time to investigate and verify them. All parcels of coffee essence, caffeine, lactose, etc., are inspected and released by the Tianjin and Shanghai Customs because they are not prohibited items. When they are sent to this area, the authorities consider them to be raw materials for manufacturing drugs and detain them all. Now that the Henan Provincial Government has ordered their confiscation, can the bureaus of Tianjin and Shanghai be instructed to stop receiving and mailing coffee essence, lactose, etc., to Henan? Please review and approve the handling. Based on this, the post office has repeatedly ordered the prohibition of illegal merchants from mailing prohibited items. If there are suspicious parcels, the local competent authorities are notified for verification. The post office and the local authorities belong to the same national agency. If there are relevant special items, they should be handled uniformly. However, the Customs considers that the sugar powder, coffee essence, etc., do not contain any toxic substances, so the post office allows them to be received and mailed. Now the Henan Provincial Government considers them to be raw materials for manufacturing drugs and has repeatedly detained them. If this situation continues to be ambiguous, not only will it be difficult to handle, but it will also easily cause misunderstandings, and the people will also feel inconvenienced. Therefore, it is proposed to notify all districts that the receipt and mailing of parcels of sugar powder, coffee essence, caffeine, lactose, and regulations will be temporarily suspended. It is also proposed to request the ministry to consult the Henan Provincial Government to clarify the situation and to request that if there are any matters related to mailing in the future, the ministry should be consulted first for review and handling in order to avoid ambiguity in the methods. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has approved the bureau to issue an order to its subordinates to temporarily prohibit the mailing of saccharin and coffee essence, etc. When the situation in various places allows for the ban to be lifted, the receipt and mailing will be resumed. The regulations, since they are medicines for treating diseases, should be excluded and not on the list of prohibited items.</p>

It was resolved to approve them. The original letter stated, "Dear Sirs, The work relief project of this association has been completed in order. After the 49th meeting, it was decided to appoint committee members as inspection and acceptance committee members for the work relief project in various counties. They will depart in the coming days. Therefore, the acceptance project form is enclosed for your review. Please fill it out in detail according to the form and wait for the acceptance committee members to arrive in the county to inspect and accept the project at the construction site according to the form. It is hoped that you will accompany them at that time to explain everything to facilitate the process. In addition to sending letters to the county governments for assistance, this letter is sent to you for your review." It was also decided to postpone the departure of the three acceptance commissioners, Zha Zhongjian, Yu Boxian, and Yin Youfu, until the end of the month.</p>

<p>The Xuzhou Xinwan News, due to the reprinting of telegrams from the Nanjing Dahua Evening News and People's Evening News a month ago, was deemed by the Ninth District Security Command to have fabricated facts and attempted to disrupt public order. The newspaper was closed down, and the president, Chen Suyi, was arrested and sent to the Tongshan County Government, which also handled judicial matters, for trial. On the 30th of last month, the president, Chen Suyi, was sentenced to seven months' imprisonment. The newspaper, due to the fact that County Magistrate Wang Gongxing of the county showed suspicion of bias and illegally imposed the sentence during the trial, sent Vice President Xia Yiming to appeal in various places in Beijing and Shanghai. The Shanghai Journalists' Association also received a letter from Xia requesting support and raised it for discussion at the standing committee meeting on July 23.

The committee ordered an investigation and verification and notified the relevant parties. According to the report from the Provincial Government, 'The Department of Education has this plan to establish an aquatic products vocational school, but due to the financial difficulties of the provincial treasury and the repeated tightening of the regular budgets of the various departments, the Department of Construction established an aquatic products experiment field last year by changing the former aquatic products school factory to adapt to actual needs and develop the aquatic products industry, in order to manage the improvement of the aquatic products industry throughout the province. The school cannot be restored.' The report was submitted to the committee for review. Chen was instructed to notify and so on. This letter is sent to you for your review.

It is said that Mr. Wany has been independently engaged in telephone consulting for the past fifteen years and has extensive experience in telephone rate regulations. He has accepted the invitation of the Municipal Council to come to Shanghai to investigate the Shanghai Telephone Company's request for price increases and the adoption of a per-call charging system. He is scheduled to depart from Seattle, USA, on the President McKinley on August 3rd and arrive in Shanghai around August 20th. The list of candidates for the Telephone Expert Committee is now complete, including Mr. Hu Ruixiang (Chinese), Dr. Inada (Japanese), Major Brown (British), and Mr. Ray (American). All of them have accepted the invitation of the Municipal Council to serve as investigators. It is expected that the Telephone Expert Committee will begin its work around the middle of next month.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Japanese Daily, the 24th was the "Great Heat" festival, which the Japanese call "Doyo no Ushi no Hi." On this day, according to Japanese custom, everyone should eat eel, meaning that after eating eel on the "Great Heat" day, they can avoid colds and other illnesses this year. This superstition is prevalent throughout Japan, so yesterday, Japanese restaurants in this city prepared large quantities of eel to supply customers. The eel that best suits the taste of Japanese residents is Niigata eel. In recent days, eel vendors in various small vegetable markets have seen their profits multiply.</p>

<p>Gu Miaojin, a mason from Liujiabang Village, Zhanghuabang, Wusong, was considered middle class. The night before last, he attended a banquet with friends and returned home at dusk, already intoxicated. He fell asleep immediately. At midnight, his wife suddenly got up to catch mosquitoes, lighting a kerosene lamp for light. She was careless and accidentally knocked over the kerosene lamp onto the bed curtains. The curtains immediately caught fire, and flames soared. Gu woke up from his dream and helped his wife put out the fire. However, the fire intensified due to the wind, and soon it pierced the roof and became uncontrollable. Gu had to escape from the fire, fortunately unharmed. His wife, being a woman, also escaped from the house, but she was burned all over her body. Five rooms of their own house were burned down, fortunately not affecting the neighbors. All their belongings were reduced to ashes. Yesterday, Gu took his wife to the Wusong Health Hospital for treatment, but she died due to the fire attacking her heart and lungs. It is tragic that catching mosquitoes led to family ruin.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Blood and Sweat Money Swindled: Zhuang Huaiyou is Indeed Pitiful; How Can Qi Xinming Be So Heartless? <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Zhuang Huaiyou, a 42-year-old from Yizhou, Shandong, left his hometown in his youth to work in Hong Kong, engaged in mountain opening and road construction for 26 years. He saved 300 yuan of hard-earned money and took a ship from Hong Kong back to his hometown. He arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month. Zhuang, unfamiliar with Shanghai, wanted to stay in a hotel. While he was hesitating on the ship, Qi Xinming (28 years old), a native of Anhui who worked as a hotel tout for the Guangtailai Hotel at 107 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, approached Zhuang and led him to the Guangtailai Hotel, where he booked room 207. Qi saw that Zhuang was a rustic and ignorant fellow, and knowing that Zhuang had a large sum of money, he harbored malicious intentions. He pretended to be helpful and colluded with an accomplice, Mr. Jia, instructing Zhuang to take 200 yuan in cash and go with Mr. Jia to a bank to exchange it for Shandong Province general currency, saying that this would avoid exchange losses when he arrived in Shandong. Zhuang believed him and followed Mr. Jia with the money to the front of a foreign firm on the Bund. Mr. Jia told Zhuang that there were "red-headed devils" (foreigners) guarding the entrance of the bank who would not allow poorly dressed people to enter, so he could give the money to Mr. Jia to exchange it for him. Zhuang, unaware of the deception, handed over the money and watched Mr. Jia enter the bank. He waited outside for several hours, but Mr. Jia did not come out. Zhuang inquired inside but found no clues. He returned to the Guangtailai Hotel dejectedly and confronted Qi Xinming. However, Qi flatly denied introducing an acquaintance to exchange the money. Zhuang, struck by this, was depressed all day. Qi, knowing that Zhuang still had money, invited Zhuang to stay at his home to save money. Zhuang, still unaware of the scheme, rashly agreed. They went to Qi's home upstairs at 87 Xixinqiao Street. At the same time, Qi asked Zhuang for 80 yuan as capital for doing petty trading in other places, saying that any profits would be shared. Zhuang agreed and gave Qi the money. After a few days, Qi gave Zhuang 29 yuan, saying it was the profit from the trading. Meanwhile, Qi secretly incited hooligans to threaten Zhuang, forcing him to leave Shanghai and wanting to rob Zhuang of his silver dollars. Zhuang refused to yield and continued to stay at Qi's home, gradually pawning his belongings. Qi then falsely claimed to Zhuang that the capital he had given him had been confiscated by the customs. As a result, the two had a quarrel. On the 16th of this month, both parties were taken to the French Concession police station. After questioning by the police chief, Qi was arrested for fraud and ordered to be detained. The next day, he was sent to the Special Second Court. After hearing the case, Judge Dong Qiming of the Special Second Court continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahong presented the case and prosecuted Qi for fraud. The plaintiff, Zhuang Huaiyou, recounted the circumstances of the fraud and hired a lawyer to file a private lawsuit. Detective Wang Yamin then reported the results of the investigation. Qi Xinming confessed that he only took 80 yuan from Zhuang to trade silver dollars in Hong Kong for profit, but it was confiscated by the customs and there was no fraud of 200 yuan. Zhou Guiting, the second landlord of the defendant, testified that he only knew that Wang and Qi were arguing about money. The court reviewed the testimonies and ordered a further hearing on the 27th, as it was still necessary to summon witnesses. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>In October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, a gangster named Ji A'gen, residing in Youyuli, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, was attacked in the early morning by enemies wielding axes and pistols, suffering injuries to his shoulders, back, hands, and feet, and was shot in the tip of his nose and killed. The murderer fled and was not apprehended. Unexpectedly, the murderer, Yao Gonglin, was spotted in front of the Citibank building on Jiujiang Road yesterday noon by the deceased's wife, Ji Wangshi. Wang secretly informed the constable on duty there, who arrested him and took him to the Central Patrol Station. After questioning by the police chief, as the case occurred within the jurisdiction of the Zhabei Xinzha Branch, he called the branch to send personnel to take custody. Upon receiving the report, Chief Ruan of the branch immediately ordered Detective Squad Leader Bao Ziying to send Deputy Squad Leader Liu Changpei and Detective Mao Gongzhao to the Central Patrol Station to take Yao Gonglin into custody. Yao confessed that he was 27 years old, from Zhenjiang, and was currently working as a copper worker's assistant in a boiler room in the Citibank building on Erma Road. He admitted that he and several accomplices killed Ji A'gen with axes and pistols on the 24th day of the eighth lunar month in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (i.e., October in the Gregorian calendar). He also stated that he was instructed by someone to do so, and they originally planned to cut off one of Ji's hands or feet, but the situation became deadlocked, so they killed him. After the incident, he fled to the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau to serve as a detective, etc. He also confessed to the names of several accomplices. The Detective Squad sent personnel to arrest them separately, but the accomplices had already fled upon hearing the news. Therefore, the Detective Squad is currently conducting a strict investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Russian Merchant "Oil Everywhere" Company in Litigation with "Guanghua Kerosene" Company: Person in Charge of the Mainland Bank Talks About the Case <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of litigation between the Russian merchant "Oil Everywhere" Company and the "Guanghua Kerosene" Company, according to the person in charge of the Mainland Bank, Guanghua Kerosene Company has always been involved in the transportation and sale of Russian kerosene, and its business has been quite developed. In November of last year, after renegotiating the purchase and sale contract with "Oil Everywhere", it had already ordered several batches without any objections. However, due to extreme economic decline and rural bankruptcy, sales sharply decreased. Moreover, when the contract was renegotiated, Guanghua claimed that the color and quality of the oil purchased from "Oil Everywhere" did not comply with the contract, resulting in further stagnation in sales. Therefore, it was difficult to fulfill the contract quota. Guanghua Company had repeatedly negotiated with "Oil Everywhere", and Mr. Odyn, the former representative of "Oil Everywhere" stationed in Shanghai who signed the contract at the time, also acknowledged that the current decline in the oil market was a real situation. When he left Shanghai to return to Moscow, he promised to discuss a method to appropriately reduce the quota with his head office, and repeatedly stated that "Oil Everywhere" would cooperate with Guanghua to promote sales and would not penalize Guanghua. Therefore, Guanghua Company continued to make efforts to promote sales and waited for Mr. Odyn's response. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Odyn left, there was no news for a long time. Recently, "Oil Everywhere" suddenly changed its attitude, completely denying the previous negotiations with Guanghua, and directly claimed that Guanghua Company had breached the contract, demanding that Guanghua pay a penalty of 100,000 yuan, and requiring the bank, as Guanghua's guarantor, to pay on its behalf. It was the case that when "Oil Everywhere" and Guanghua renegotiated the contract, the usual bank guarantee was required. Our bank and the Guohuo, Guohua, and Shanghai banks had existing joint business relationships with Guanghua, such as opening letters of credit, overdrafts, etc. Therefore, the Guohuo, Guohua, Shanghai, and our bank jointly guaranteed the contract, and our bank represented them in signing the guarantee letter, stipulating a guarantee liability limited to 200,000 yuan. At the same time, the bank obtained full collateral from Guanghua to prepare for any eventuality. Therefore, the bank could readily disburse the funds at any time. However, because Guanghua itself now denies having breached the contract, and its shareholders raised objections to the renegotiated contract and successively came to the bank requesting a halt to the payment, the bank could not ignore Guanghua's interests and pay the penalty. This caused the lawsuit filed by "Oil Everywhere". In short, since this case has already gone to litigation, it must await the court's judgment. The key point lies in the dispute between Guanghua and "Oil Everywhere". After the court's trial and judgment, the question of whether Guanghua should pay the penalty can be resolved at the same time. Since this case occurred, the bank has been in a third-party position and has no vested interest in it. However, it seems to be more harmful than beneficial to "Oil Everywhere"'s Far East market.

<h3 id="e144">New Life Movement Association Streamlines Shipping, Appoints Liu Hongsheng as Instructor, Gradually Reforms the Bad Habits of Servants, Issues Revised Plan for Streamlining China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Servants <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Nanchang New Life Movement Promotion Association, in order to streamline shipping and make the servants of various ships aware of the implementation of the New Life Movement, specially appointed Liu Hongsheng as the instructor for the New Life Movement in shipping, and ordered him to draft a plan for implementation. Mr. Liu immediately expressed his acceptance and drafted a plan, which was submitted to the New Life Movement Association for review and decision. Yesterday, the New Life Movement Association revised the plan and sent it down, and dispatched the association's cadre and secretary, Yan Baohang, to assist in the implementation. Mr. Yan is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The association also sent a letter to the Ministry of Communications, instructing various shipping companies to cooperate in handling the matter, and sent a letter to the Central People's Movement Committee, instructing the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union to cooperate in the implementation, in order to achieve practical results in streamlining. It is learned that Mr. Yan will start the implementation immediately after arriving in Shanghai, starting with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and then extending to other private shipping companies. The revised plan of the Association is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Plan for Streamlining China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Servants</p>
<p>1.  Purpose: To promote the New Life Movement, so that the servants of various ships know how to observe discipline, be polite, be sanitary, and fulfill their duties, so that all ships have an orderly appearance.</p>
<p>2.  Current situation: (A) The number of servants on various ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is excessive. The New Jiangtian Ship has as many as 270 servants on the main shift. Other river ships, such as the first-class Jiangshun, Jianghua, Jiangxin, and Jiang'an ships, each have more than 110 to 150 servants. Second-class ships, such as the Jianguo, Jiangda, and Jiangjing, have around 100 servants. Ocean liners, such as the Xin Mingda, have more than 60 servants, while other ships have less than 40 servants. (B) Because of the large number of people and the lack of salaries, extortion for tips, privately carrying passengers, and selling drugs are common occurrences. (C) The servants of various ships lack the knowledge and skills of service and lack the necessary management, so there is no way to talk about sanitation, etiquette, or discipline.</p>
<p>3.  Reasonable system: (A) The implementation of a reasonable system starts with reducing the number of servants. Based on the number of passenger seats and the complexity of the business, a standard quota should be set, and the excess number should be eliminated or other remedies sought. (B) The servants of various ships should be directly hired and managed by the company, and service rules should be stipulated and strictly enforced by the heads of each ship. The tipping system should be changed to a salary system, and tips should not be collected. (C) The servants of various ships must wear uniforms and badges in order to work on the ship.</p>
<p>4.  Implementation methods: (A) Establish a New Life Training Class for Servants, and rotate the servants of various ships to the shore for training, teaching them the knowledge and skills of service that they should have, and cultivating their character to meet the requirements of the New Life Movement. (B) The training course includes: (A) Military training, (B) New Life Knowledge, (C) Service Common Sense, (D) Spiritual Admonition, (E) Others (Mandarin, dialect, letters, etc.). (C) Those who pass the examination upon completion of the training will be given a certificate for employment. Those who do not pass will be given severance pay. If the number of qualified servants exceeds the actual number needed, a rotational service method will be stipulated in advance to provide relief. (D) The servants of various ships should gradually change to a salary system, and tips should not be collected. Before the salary system is implemented, the maximum amount of tips should be stipulated, and passengers should be free to give rewards without extortion. (E) The business department of each ship should be managed by a full-time employee. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should introduce business directors for each ship who are responsible for the employment of servants.</p>
<p>5.  The New Life Training Class for Servants is guided by the New Life Movement Promotion Association, organized by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and assisted by the Seamen's Union.</p>

<p>Hua Inspector Feng Zhiming, Liu Shaokui, and Detective Wu Hanzhang of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police apprehended nine suspects including Zhang Xueyuan, Li Yucai, and Bao Xuewen in a large-scale counterfeit currency operation at No. 806 Zhoujiazui Road on the morning of the 9th of this month. They seized a considerable number of counterfeit currency printing machines, molds, silver ingots, and other items. The suspects were handed over to the First Special District Court and interrogated twice, as reported in this newspaper. The presiding judge, Jiang Shuzi, held a</p>
<p>Special Tribunal</p>
<p>on the day before yesterday to conduct a thorough investigation. The main suspect in the ring is Wang Zhaoxiang, who is at large. The office was located in the American Tobacco Company warehouse at No. 789 Dalianwan Road. Yang Shangzhi, a friend of the defendant Li Yucai (an employee of the warehouse), introduced and sublet the space to Wang Zhaoxiang as a secret liaison office for selling counterfeit currency, with a monthly rent of one hundred yuan. The house at No. 806 Zhoujiazui Road was also leased through Xu Wensheng, a local guarantor and shareholder of Hong Tai Yuan Foreign Goods Store at No. 1399 Robert Road, under the false pretense of being a Changxing Canned Food Factory. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer for the Municipal Council, stated that the manufacturing of</p>
<p>Counterfeit Currency Ring</p>
<p>at Zhoujiazui Road began on June 28th, producing four hundred yuan on the first day and six hundred yuan every day thereafter. The office at No. 789 Dalianwan Road was used as a liaison point for buying silver and selling light counterfeit silver dollars. The defendant Zhang Shixin, who runs a cigarette paper shop on Yangzhou Road, was arrested in front of his shop while buying light counterfeit silver dollars from Xiao Yucai. Xu Wensheng, the owner of Hong Tai Yuan Foreign Goods Store, was also present in court. The defense requested that each defendant be</p>
<p>Interrogated Separately</p>
<p>Xu Wensheng testified that he was one of the shareholders of Hong Tai Yuan Department Store. His old friend Yang Jinwen (i.e., Shangzhi) asked him to act as a guarantor for leasing the house at No. 806 Zhoujiazui Road for opening a canned food factory. He had previously owned the Tiancheng Towel Factory in Jiading and had business dealings with Xu's store, knowing each other for over ten years. He claimed he was unaware that the house was used for manufacturing counterfeit currency and was deceived by Yang. Zhang Xueyuan testified that he met Wang Zhaoxiang at a hotel last year. On the 27th of last month, Wang introduced him to work at the factory with a monthly salary of forty-one yuan. Wang was the boss, and Zhang</p>
<p>was in charge of the machinery department,</p>
<p>but he was not allowed to enter the inner sanctum. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Li Yucai testified that he was an employee at the American Tobacco warehouse at No. 789 Dalianwan Road and knew Yang Shangzhi. Yang introduced and temporarily rented out a room as an office for one hundred yuan, which was used by Wang Zhaoxiang. The three hundred and thirty-one counterfeit silver dollars seized were brought by someone on the 29th of last month for temporary storage. He only learned that they were counterfeit after the raid. He retracted his confession to the police. Bao Xuewen testified that on the afternoon of June 26th, Yang Shangzhi introduced him to work at the canned food factory with</p>
<p>Bookkeeping Responsibilities,</p>
<p>with a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Wang Zhaoxiang was the boss. Yang A'gen testified that Wang Zhaoxiang introduced him to work as a laborer pushing the machines this month, with a monthly salary of twelve yuan. Qu Heshang testified similarly to Yang. Hua Haiqing testified that Wang Zhaoxiang introduced him to serve as a tea servant with a monthly salary of twelve yuan. He was unaware of the counterfeit currency manufacturing and was arrested after working for only two days. Zhu Yuanzhi testified that on the 5th of this month, he went to the factory to find his friend Chen Genda. Wang Zhaoxiang asked him to operate the bellows for melting silver with a monthly salary of eight or nine yuan. Chen Shifu testified that he became a cook on June 27th with a monthly salary of twelve yuan. Wang Zhaoxiang introduced him. Zhang Shixin testified that at that time, he</p>
<p>Opened a Cigarette Paper Shop</p>
<p>on Yangzhou Road.</p>
<p>He was ordered by his father to take one hundred and one silver dollars to his brother-in-law, Wang Weishan, at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Company on Ningbo Road to repay a debt. While taking a rickshaw and passing the entrance of No. 789 Dalianwan Road, he saw a large crowd of people and stopped to watch. He was then arrested. His father, Zhang Shuizhang, also testified that he indeed gave his son Shixin one hundred silver dollars to repay a loan of one hundred yuan to his son-in-law, Wang Weishan, at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Company on Ningbo Road, which was borrowed on June 15th. Wang confirmed that he and Zhang Shuizhang are indeed in-laws and there was such a loan. The hearing reached this point</p>
<p>When it was already dusk.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council lawyer Wang stated that Xu Wensheng, a witness in this case, should bring the account books of his dealings with Yang Shangzhi's Tiancheng Towel Factory for verification to determine the truth. He requested a continuation of the hearing for tomorrow. The court approved the request. Yesterday morning, the defendants were transferred to the Third Criminal Court. Many new cases brought by the Yangshupu, Hongkou, Jiaxing Road, and Yulin Road police stations were also awaiting trial. After the hearings were completed, the court addressed this case, but by then it was already noon. The Municipal Council lawyer Wang stated that the</p>
<p>Counterfeit Silver Dollars</p>
<p>manufactured by the ring were found to have been sold by Yao and Zhu, partners of the Lao Feng Bao Silver Shop on Yuezhou Road, to the office on Dalianwan Road in large quantities. Furthermore, there was also counterfeit twenty-two yuan received. The owner of the silver shop, He Xianshang, was also present. He claimed that he did not know any of the defendants and that this type of silver was not from his silver shop, and someone could prove it. Yao Laijun stated that he was a broker at the Lao Feng Bao Silver Shop. All the silver sold to the office at No. 789 Dalianwan Road was introduced by a friend surnamed Chen at a pawnshop behind the Yong'an Company, totaling eight or nine hundred yuan, including counterfeit twenty-two yuan. When the raid occurred, Yao knew it</p>
<p>was an illegal</p>
<p>operation and immediately handed it over to Inspector Feng to be taken to the police station. Inspector Feng stated that it had been combined with the three hundred and thirty-one counterfeit silver dollars seized at the office on Dalianwan Road and stored in the exhibits warehouse. Lawyer Wang also stated that the seized counterfeit silver dollars had not yet been tested. He then questioned how much weight was lost. The account books submitted by Xu Wensheng regarding his dealings with the Tiancheng Towel Factory were very vague. He was very suspicious regarding the case. Judge Jiang stated that if it was clearly related, a separate indictment could be filed. He ordered the start of closing arguments, which were presented by the defendants' lawyers Fan Gang, Deng Jiabing, and Shen Xingxia. The defendants were ordered to be held, and a date was set for sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e146">The National Products World to Open as Scheduled; Gathering Novel Entertainments and Conducting Cigarette Advertising <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Since the Nanjing Road New World site was converted into the National Products World, news has spread, and national product factories have been enthusiastically registering to participate. Eighty percent of the planned spaces have already been claimed. National product factories from other locations, such as Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi, have also been sending letters requesting to join. In addition to the commercial area, which will soon be ready, the entertainment section is also actively underway. Here is a summary of the latest developments:</p>
<p>Novel Entertainments The World is actively seeking out valuable entertainments from both local and foreign locations, following the example of the Three Companies, to entertain guests. It has been reported that there are many who have applied. Others, such as the Small Park, will be transformed into a Night Flower Enclosure, and it is planned to set up an open-air dance floor in the park. The Da Jing Ban Opera Theater will perform the most famous entertainments. It has been reported that someone has requested to contract with the World. The rest, such as the Donkey Race, the Large Rockery, and the Fish Pond, are being actively arranged to make it a summer night resort.</p>
<p>Cigarette Advertising National product cigarettes have reached a declining period. Over the past few months, more than thirty national cigarette factories have stopped work and shut down. The World, in view of this, launched a national product cigarette publicity campaign on the second floor's west side, to expand publicity, and is now soliciting the agreement of the National Products Cigarette Maintenance Association and the National Products Cigarette Factory Industry Trade Association to agree, after which it will be held in order to awaken the people of the country to love smoking domestic cigarettes.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Health Bureau to Conduct Registration of Maternity Patients and Prevent Hospital Fraudulent Practices <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Li Ting'an, the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, has specially ordered You Jihua, the director of the Shanghai South District Health Office, to prepare everything for public health, maternal and infant health, and registration of maternity patients. The following is a breakdown of the situation as learned by a National Press reporter:</p>
<p>Implementation of Maternal and Infant Health</p>
<p>It is unknown how many women are sacrificed in China because of childbirth by old-fashioned midwives. Every time a midwife helps deliver a child, she uses broken porcelain and broken glass and iron scissors to cut the baby's umbilical cord, with no knowledge of disinfection methods. There is no midwifery technique and no scientific knowledge, so infants often develop umbilical cord wind, (namely tetanus, commonly known as seven-day wind), and die. There is no way to handle the after-childbirth and baby-care measures, so mothers are at risk of developing "postpartum fever." Director Li believes that this is especially true in Shanghai, and the consequences would be dire if this continues. He issued a special order yesterday to You Jihua, the director of the Shanghai South District Health Office, to implement maternal and infant health care in order to avoid the sacrifice of mothers and infants and to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Conducting Maternity Patient Registration</p>
<p>In order to protect the safety of mothers and babies, the Municipal Health Bureau will conduct maternity registration in the Shanghai South District Health Office on Linqin Road in Nanshi, and will formulate regulations and various forms. All pregnant women who are more than five months pregnant can go to the office to obtain a registration form, fill it out and submit it to the office for record. There will be specialists to guide the diet and living arrangements and the maintenance method of pregnancy, and to regularly check whether there is any abnormality in the baby's position. At the same time, there will be considerable corrections to the daily movements of pregnant women. According to You Jihua, the director of the Shanghai South District Health Office, who spoke to the National Press reporter, the hospital plans to cooperate with Nanshi Shanghai Public Hospital to implement maternal and infant health care, but the formalities for maternity registration are still being prepared, and it will be implemented in about a month.</p>
<p>Preventing False Name Fraud</p>
<p>Recently, a number of obstetrical hospitals in the city have been publishing advertisements in various newspapers, and their delivery prices are prominently displayed as being cheap, but many citizens have been deceived. Although scientific methods are also used for delivery, apart from the delivery fee, they will fraudulently establish various expenses, such as injection of labor-inducing drugs, hemostatic drugs, blood tonic drugs, and cardiotonic drugs, which results in a considerable amount of money, which puts a heavy burden on the pregnant woman's economy. Therefore, the bureau will take measures to prevent the above-mentioned obstetrical hospitals from defrauding patients.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Case of Judge's Dereliction of Duty Transferred to Shanghai for Trial <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>When Feng Jiasheng, a prosecutor of the Minhou District Court in Fujian, was on duty, he handled a case in which Chen, the party concerned, was detained even though he should not have been detained, causing Chen to become ill in detention and die without medical treatment. Chen's family was deeply dissatisfied and charged Feng Jiasheng with causing death due to dereliction of duty to the Fujian High Court, which transferred jurisdiction to the Shanghai District Court. Therefore, Feng was dismissed some days ago, and police were dispatched to escort Feng Jiasheng to Shanghai, where he reported directly to the Shanghai District Court. Subsequently, Prosecutor Ouyang Shu submitted a proposal for examination and inquiry, and Feng was ordered to be detained after the facts were confirmed. A public prosecution was filed based on the facts, and a public trial should be held soon.</p>
<h3 id="e149">License Fees for Rickshaws and Handcarts Temporarily Suspended from Increase; Original Intention of Tax Increase Not Entirely Financial <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council decided to increase the license fees for rickshaws and handcarts in the Public Concession, it has been repeatedly protested and opposed. The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council has repeatedly considered this matter, and recently decided that the license fees should be temporarily suspended from being increased. However, a precise investigation of the position of these human-powered carts in traffic is still necessary in order to determine future policies. It is reported that the board of directors of the Municipal Council has adopted the Finance Committee's recommendation.</p>
<p>The tax increase for rickshaws and handcarts was based on the quota of various taxes and license fees of the Municipal Council passed at the Western Taxpayers' Annual Meeting in the spring of this year, and should have been implemented from July 1 this year. Subsequently, the industry submitted a request to withdraw the order, taking into account the difficulties of commerce, and also requested the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to appeal on its behalf. The Municipal Council then had a plan to postpone the increase. However, the increase in taxes was not entirely for financial reasons. The so-called rickshaws are originally small carts for transporting goods at the pier, which are used exclusively for cargo warehouses and stations at the pier, with a load limit of 500 pounds. However, over time, abuses have arisen. These carts are now all over the city's streets, and the load limit has been exceeded, with many weighing up to 1,000 pounds. As a result, the road surface is often damaged when they travel on the road. After discussion by the heads of various departments in the Municipal Council, it was decided to increase the license fees in order to limit them, and the license stipulated that the load must not exceed 300 pounds. Now that the increase in license fees has had to be postponed due to the opposition of the industry, there is still room for discussion on the position of these vehicles in traffic. According to the opinion expressed by the Finance Committee during the discussion, on the one hand, the number of licenses for existing vehicles must be limited, and on the other hand, other methods must be found to ban them. Some also suggested that rickshaws should be equipped with rubber wheels. Others said that after rickshaws are equipped with rubber wheels, the bureau can return one-third of the license fees to show preferential treatment. However, whether the car owners have the financial resources to do so is still questionable. As a result, in addition to the postponement of the increase in license fees, the traffic issue will be discussed after a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after the committee of the Municipal Council resolved to postpone the tax increase for rickshaws and handcarts, the board of directors held a meeting yesterday to approve the postponement of the increase in license fees. The committee also suggested that the board of directors restrict the current number in order to ban them. It is advocated that rickshaws be converted to rubber tires to protect the road surface. After the car owners install rubber wheels, all tax amounts will be reduced by one-third, and the load is limited to 500 pounds. After discussion by the board of directors yesterday, it was decided to first investigate the total number of vehicles and then discuss it. The Mutual Aid Association for the two industries will hold an establishment meeting at the original site of New World at 2:00 p.m. today.</p>

<p>More than 60 students from the Motor Vehicle Mechanic Training Institute, jointly organized by the Highway Department of the National Economic Commission and the Transportation Commissions of the five provinces and cities of Suzhou, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, were led by three gentlemen, Shi Jiuhua, Wang Yunsheng, and Yang Jinghu, to Shanghai to visit major factories.

Finally, they were treated with refreshments and took a group photo on the roof test track to commemorate the visit.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Lumber Industry Group Opposes Categorized Business Licenses; Submits Petition to Chinese Taxpayers' Association for Just Representation <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The lumber industry in the French Concession opposes the French Municipal Council's unprovoked collection of categorized business licenses and an investigation fee of ten yuan, which is difficult to bear in the current depressed market. Yesterday, they submitted a joint petition to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association for just representation. The Lumber Industry Trade Association also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the municipal government to negotiate with the French Party Bureau. The Xin Xin News Agency has compiled the following details:</p>
<p>Group Opposition</p>
<p>The lumber industry submitted a joint petition to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association for just representation yesterday in order to understand the difficulties of commerce. The original letter reads, "To whom it may concern, we are now informed that the Chinese and Westerners from the French Concession Public Affairs Bureau are carrying a notice from the bureau's Categorized Business Department, claiming that we should immediately donate and obtain a categorized business hygiene license from the bureau and pay an examination fee of two yuan and ten yuan, which is shocking. We have been open for many years, and there has never been such a donation certificate. In February of the year before last, the bureau issued a notice to us to donate and obtain a license, and we sent a letter to your association to negotiate with the French Public Affairs Bureau. Subsequently, we received a letter from the bureau stating that, with the exception of the construction industry, donation certificates could be exempted. The question of whether our industry should donate a certificate is unnecessary to elaborate on. Now the Public Affairs Bureau is fickle and has issued a donation certificate again after two years. It is unfortunate that the lack of fairness in public affairs is regrettable for the taxpayers in the concession. At this time, the market is extremely depressed, and the impact on our industry is even greater than that of other industries. If we increase the donation again, we will be unable to bear it. Therefore, we jointly send this letter to your association, requesting that you forward a letter to the French Public Affairs Bureau to negotiate and cancel the donation certificate."</p>
<p>Request for Just Representation</p>
<p>The Lumber Industry Trade Association of the Lumber Market received letters from members such as Yin Ji, Tong Xing, Zheng Da, etc., stating that the French Municipal Council unreasonably increased taxes and requested a transfer to the French authorities for negotiation. After learning of the situation, the association immediately sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, which read: "To whom it may concern, we now received a letter from lumber companies such as Bin Ji, Mao Sheng, Cheng Da, Tong Xing, Fu Xing, Li Da, He Tai, Li Xing, Hou Da, and Zheng Da, stating that four people from the Categorized Business Department of the French Concession Public Affairs Bureau came to the number and claimed that, starting from today, they should donate and obtain a categorized business hygiene license from the Public Affairs Bureau and pay an examination fee of ten yuan, which is unbearable in the current depression of all industries. According to the increase in taxes, government orders must be used as a measure, even within the concession, the procedure must be approved by your association. Now the bureau has rashly levied taxes, which is inconsistent with the law. Especially when commerce is in decline, it should be maintained and not exploited in order to revitalize the market. In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to transfer to the municipal government for negotiation, we especially send a letter to your association to help in the interest of justice in order to revive commerce.</p>

<p>Xia Agui, a boatman in his twenties, from Wusong Wenzaobang, is currently working as a sailor on the Tongchongban shipping line.

She became pregnant again recently, and on the morning of the 18th of this month, she suddenly had abdominal pain, and then gave birth to a boy, who died as soon as he landed. Unexpectedly, the abdominal pain continued after delivery, and a midwife found that there was another child in Ms. Li's abdomen, which was not easy to deliver for a while. Therefore, with the consent of the woman who was giving birth, the child was cut off surgically, but had already died for a long time, and the skin and flesh had become putrid. Ms. Li was physically weak after giving birth, and felt that both of her children had died, so she could not help but feel very sad. She died yesterday morning after treatment failed, which is truly a tragic event. Now Agui's uncle, Xia Xingyuan, is preparing a coffin for burial on his behalf.</p>

Taking Bailing Wan after each meal to promote the digestion of gastric juices will prevent various gastrointestinal diseases from occurring. Greed for coolness and aversion to heat in summer can block the secretion of sweat glands, preventing sweat from evaporating, leading to headaches, coughs, nasal congestion, loss of appetite, fever, etc., which are harms due to not knowing how to maintain hygiene. Taking Bailing Oil daily after the third daily period can promote the secretion of sebaceous glands, allowing sweat to be properly discharged, and calming the mind and nerves so that one is not afraid of heat when sleeping at night, preventing heat stroke and colds.</p>

<p>Breaststroke: Mr. Tsuruta, a Japanese athlete who won the 200-meter breaststroke championship at the 10th World Games and set a new record of 2 minutes and 45.4 seconds, has a posture that is completely different from ordinary people. Almost all of his head is exposed above the water. He only lowers his head slightly when moving forward, with the water reaching his mouth. His arms are not completely straightened. When in the cross shape, his palms are bent outwards, and his arms are also turned outwards, which is effective for draining water and moving faster. His leg clamping force is very strong. The diagram is very detailed, and scholars can practice according to the diagram, which will definitely have a considerable effect. In our country's swimming, only Mr. Guo Zhenheng's breaststroke is closest to the world record.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education issued an instruction to Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute on the 24th. The original order stated, "The Ministry has sent personnel to inspect the institute. According to the report submitted and reviewed, the teachers of the institute strictly adhere to full-time duties, teaching and guidance, and are generally responsible and conscientious. The students are hardworking and simple, and their discipline is orderly. Many of the various experimental research works are practical. All of these achievements are commendable. However, the following points should be improved immediately: 1. Some of the school buildings of the institute are not strong, and there is a danger of collapse and destruction. Attention should be paid to repair them in order. The scope of the farm is too small and must be expanded to facilitate practice. 2. The experimental area of the institute is limited to one corner, lacking opportunities for comparative research. Efforts should be made to cooperate with administrative agencies, social education agencies, or rural normal schools in other appropriate locations inside and outside the province to promote experimental undertakings. The results of various experimental works currently in progress must be sent to the Ministry from time to time for reference. 3. The equipment of the experimental workshop and various laboratories of the institute is still lacking, and the library also lacks specialized and advanced books. They should be added gradually, weighing the urgent needs. The amount of equipment fees for the institute is too small and should be increased as much as possible in the future to supplement the above-mentioned equipment. 4. The institute's teaching focuses on practical problems, and practice focuses on rural farmland work, which is appropriate. However, the study of agricultural affairs and basic educational knowledge is still insufficient and should be appropriately supplemented. 5. The institute should appropriately increase the number of students recruited from other provinces to broaden training. You are hereby ordered to comply with this and report."</p>

<p>(Qingdao Correspondence) The 15th Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society and the 13th National Vocational Education Discussion Conference opened at the Municipal Girls' Middle School in this city. Group meetings were held in succession to review various proposals, which have generally come to a satisfactory conclusion. The second general meeting was held this morning (21st), and the closing ceremony was held in the afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Second General Meeting</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on this day, the second general meeting was still held in the auditorium of the Municipal Girls' Middle School. Chairman Ou Yuanhuai, after opening the meeting as usual, asked the directors of each group to report on the results of the review: (1) Wei Mingchu reported on the results of the review of the vocational school curriculum group; (2) Zhang Boyin reported on the results of the review of the vocational guidance and supplementary education group; (3) Guo Baolin reported on the results of the review of the rural improvement group; (4) Zhang Jundu reported on the results of the review of the home economics education group; (5) Ou Yuanhuai reported on the results of the review of the administrative group. After each group reported, the discussion began. 1. All cases of the administrative group were voted on according to the results of the review and passed. 2. All cases of the vocational school curriculum group were voted on according to the results of the review and passed. 3. All cases of the vocational guidance and supplementary education group, except for the 25th case which was revised and supplemented, were voted on according to the results of the review and passed. 4. All cases of the rural improvement group were voted on according to the results of the review and passed. 5. All cases of the home economics education group were voted on according to the revised methods and passed.</p>
<p>Temporary Proposals</p>
<p>(1) Please set up a vocational guidance center in Qingdao as a memorial to this conference of the Society. Reasons: Qingdao has convenient transportation and developed industry and commerce, and is a famous commercial port in the country. In recent years, education has become even more developed. The municipal authorities pay great attention to the issues of further education and employment for young people, and there are already vocational guidance committees and vocational guidance departments in various schools. Recently, personnel matters have become increasingly complex, and employers feel the lack of talent, and job seekers suffer from the lack of employment opportunities. The mismatch between supply and demand is such that the prosperity of the city and the improvement of the profession depend on a guidance agency to plan and strategize. It is appropriate to set up a special agency to preside over its affairs, so as to achieve perfection. This Society is holding an annual meeting in Qingdao this time, hoping to make a contribution and exert a slight effect. It is proposed that the Qingdao Municipal Government set up a vocational guidance center as a memorial to this conference of the Society. Is this appropriate? Please vote on it. Method: This Society will send a letter to the Qingdao Municipal Administrative Authorities to designate a preparatory committee to start preparations and complete them as soon as possible. Proposers: Liu Zhanen and Pan Wenan from the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center. (2) Please hold the next conference in Xi'an. Proposal by Shui Jimei, representative of the Gansu Education Department. (3) Please hold the 16th conference in Guangxi as decided by the previous conference. Proposal by Society member Yang Weiyu and others. The above two cases were discussed together, and it was decided that the location would be Xi'an, Nanning, or other places, and the time would be summer or winter vacation, which would be selected by the Society at that time.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines</p>
<p>At the end of each conference, there is a declaration to be issued to the society, or a telegram to be submitted to the government. This conference decided to change the method, and simply formulated five articles based on the goals commonly recognized by colleagues, as guidelines for implementation and promotion: (1) Vocational school education, vocational supplementary education, and vocational guidance advocate that the three should be given equal importance at the same time, and vocational supplementary education should be given special attention in light of the current needs of China. (2) Vocational schools that have been established must strengthen their content and practically plan the graduates' future. Vocational schools that are planned to be established should carefully examine social needs and proceed cautiously. (3) Agricultural education advocates that it should be implemented practically under the entire rural improvement plan. In addition to vocational schools that must be handled in accordance with the previous article and rural primary schools that must focus on production education, it is advocated that short-term training classes and lectures should be held frequently, anytime, anywhere, and for anything to popularize agricultural education and train agricultural technology. 4. Women's home economics must pay special attention to research and promotion. (5) Cultivating national patriotic sentiments and enhancing young people's service morality and intelligence must be given special attention when implementing vocational education. It is hoped that this positive spirit of civic training will permeate all vocational education institutions. It is recognized that young people being educated cannot complete the mission of vocational education without this spirit.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>At the closing ceremony of the conference, Chairman Lei Fazhang, Jiang Hengyuan, Huang Renzhi, Shen Xinqing, and Ou Yuanhuai performed the ceremony as usual. First, Jiang Hengyuan gave a speech, which was roughly divided into five points: (1) The recent floods are serious and we should commemorate the compatriots who were killed to express our condolences. (All stood up and remained silent for three minutes.) (2) Thank you for the enthusiastic support of all sectors of Qingdao. A formal thank you is extended in the name of the conference. (3) I apologize for the inadequate reception due to the small number of people in the office of the Vocational Education Society coming to Qingdao. Please forgive me. (4) I am very sorry that I was unable to have in-depth talks with the members who attended the meeting due to the short time in the past few days. I plan to wait for instructions in the members' lounge from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM today. (5) The proposals of the conference were hastily discussed and may not be entirely appropriate. If any inappropriate places are discovered afterwards, please send a letter to give instructions so as to increase effectiveness. Then Lei Fazhang gave a speech, roughly divided into three points: (1) I apologize for the inadequate preparation and reception beforehand. (2) The spirit of unity of the Vocational Education Society has a great influence on all undertakings. Promoting and carrying forward this spirit can revive the nation. (3) I hope that everyone can take the national crisis as a prerequisite and shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and seeking to be in charge. Shen Xinqing then gave a speech, which roughly said that the three days of the conference had passed in a hurry, and there were many feelings. Whether the excellent reception of the Qingdao Municipal Government and all sectors of society and what this conference has contributed to the local area are commensurate, I ask myself that there are still many shameful things. I hope that after you members return, you will all shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country and develop from your own position under the grand goal of reviving the nation, and contribute to the society. At the same time, help the vocational education cause and spread the light. This is to answer the grand speech of the reception of all sectors of this city. After the speech was finished, the conference concluded successfully.</p>

<p>The financial industry is as idle as usual in midsummer</p>
<p>This year, due to the sluggishness of various industries, there is no way to start lending, which leads to financial adjustment, which cannot be fully developed.

<p>Asphalt typically sees little market activity during the summer off-season. However, as the autumn paving season approaches, local merchants are preparing to supply the market. Due to limited stock, they are closely monitoring incoming shipments. However, transportation is difficult during the hot weather, delaying action. Although the Hankou market appears weak, prices could easily rise once trading begins, as inventory is low and merchants are unwilling to sell at low prices. Maché asphalt once sold for eleven taels and four qian but now requires eleven taels and six qian. Heavy Jing asphalt still demands twelve taels per unit, demonstrating market resilience. Zhejiang asphalt market news is subdued, likely because little attention is paid to off-season goods. However, the trees in Jiahe, western Zhejiang, are bearing fruit. Current observations suggest a successful harvest, barring unforeseen events. New crop yields are expected to be several times higher than last winter. However, it is hard to predict whether sales will increase. Over-supply when the new crop arrives could dramatically alter the market.</p>

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>As a reporter traveling in Qingdao, I visited the Fourth Iron Exhibition. The exhibits from each pavilion were extremely rich, and I deeply rejoice that China has boundless hope for the future. After visiting the sales office, the scene in front of the door was deserted, no longer like the scene in the previous session in Peiping. I began to lament that the current people's purchasing power is unexpectedly weak, and I felt that I was being bound and restrained everywhere, and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and I was extremely heartbroken! It is unfortunate to be born in this world. Even the slogan of "Promoting National Goods" will be silenced by someone, and no publicity will be allowed. How can one not be saddened? However, since the situation is like this, there is no other way. Everyone must clench their teeth and work hard, and there will be a day when we can breathe a sigh of relief. From now on, whether it is a manufacturing factory or a sales store, for national goods, we can only work hard on the ground. We, the common people, can only follow them and do what we can. We don't have to rush for quick success, and we don't have to talk endlessly. It is just a matter of clenching our teeth, swallowing our blood, and fighting for honor.</p>
<p>In this extremely difficult era, national goods industrialists should not be overly pessimistic and simply be passive, nor should they be vain and arrogant and take it lightly. For everything, we can only achieve "drinking tears and containing sorrow", and wait quietly for the day to come again. Small setbacks need not be discouraged, and all kinds of difficulties and hardships may not be the old heaven to achieve you. What is especially important is to know yourself and your enemy. To know your enemy, you must first know yourself. Knowing your own weaknesses, you can then achieve something. Knowing the strengths of others, you can then learn from them. The way out for the national goods industry is here.</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Revival Association and the Future of National Goods <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>We have examined the trends of the national goods movement in recent years, and it has gradually moved from the theoretical to the practical stage. Many people are working hard and making efforts to move forward. This is indeed a good phenomenon to save the current economic crisis in our country. The "Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee" initiated by the city's chamber of commerce and jointly organized by the industrial and commercial circles has been formally established and has issued a declaration and work outline. It can make us believe even more that under the urgent phenomenon of the industrial crisis, the emergence of this committee has the greatest significance for the development of the future of national goods, because the industrial management and production technology neglected by our country's industrial circles in the past are undoubtedly the main reason for hindering the progress of the entire cause. The association is now advocating how to improve industrial technology and management methods, which will indeed give the industrial and commercial circles a new opportunity for revival and progress.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, our country is originally a country with backward production. Therefore, industrial organization, management methods, and production technology cannot compete with foreigners, and the progress of the industry has also suffered great difficulties. However, here, we must never be discouraged. We must know that our country's current production rate and consumption rate are only in a ratio of two to five. Therefore, the emergence of new industries and the adaptation of mechanized products to the needs of the public are precisely driven by historical conditions. We only need to recognize that Chinese industry has suffered losses in organization and technology in the past. From now on, we will seek to improve industrial technology and sales methods from here, and investigate the main reasons for the decline of various industries, and give appropriate remedies. This scientific attitude and the conscious performance of the industrial and commercial circles are the best and most correct phenomena.</p>
<p>However, at the beginning of the association's establishment, in my personal opinion, there are still a few practical issues worthy of discussion that should be put forward for discussion and hope that the public will pay attention to. That is, first, I hope that the association can further expand and improve its own organization, and hire industry leaders, or people with rich knowledge and experience, to jointly study and seek the development of the industrial and commercial circles in the future, so as to be competent for this arduous task. Second, we must conduct a detailed survey of the industrial situation of industrial advanced countries in the world, and refer to their organization and technology in a certain industry, and draft a standard plan for improvement that is suitable for our country, so as to prepare for the reform and practice of various industries in the future. Third, after the investigation, we must take an active attitude and do our best to guide various industries with the research results and design improvement methods that have been achieved, and implement them in a practical manner. In this way, I think the recession in the entire industrial and commercial circles will surely turn from the abyss of near bankruptcy to the bright right track.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Rational Summer Supplies <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The wheels of the era are following the track of time, and some are not lazy in the past. Now, it is already the summer when the fire umbrella is high and the heat waves are hitting. In summer, our daily necessities, food, and clothing are naturally different from other seasons. There are some small changes. To be clear, people are indeed very cautious about summer supplies. How to purchase rational summer supplies has become a problem worth discussing. Regarding this issue, it seems that someone in this publication has talked about it, but in my opinion, it still feels slightly brief and not detailed enough. Now, I will express some simple opinions on how to rationalize summer supplies according to my views below:</p>
<p>First, I think rational summer supplies should naturally be national goods. We are Chinese, and we should purchase Chinese goods. Whether it is winter or summer, we should purchase national goods for our living needs throughout the year, 365 days a year. In this way, the national goods industry will develop, the national goods movement will succeed, the national economy will be prosperous, and rural bankruptcy can be saved. During this summer, our supplies are naturally more than other seasons. I sincerely advise my fellow compatriots who purchase summer supplies to firmly remember the words "national goods", so that we will be able to recover a lot of rights and interests, which is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Second, I think rational summer supplies should be durable. Everyone knows that the difference between durable supplies and non-durable supplies is very large. Some people buy a shirt that can be worn for three summers. However, some people buy a shirt that can only be worn for one summer. What is the difference between being cheap and being at a disadvantage? It goes without saying. Therefore, when we purchase summer supplies, we should go to famous national goods factories to buy them. For example, for towel quilts, we should go to Sanyou Industrial Company to buy them. For shirts, we should go to Wuhe or Jinglun to buy them. For straw hats, we should go to Huafu Zhenxing to buy them. We cannot lack this common sense, because the products of famous national goods factories seem to be slightly more expensive on the surface, but after buying them, they are much more durable than ordinary ones. We should understand this inherent cheapness.</p>
<p>Third, I want to talk about summer drinks. In summer, people's consumption of drinks is also very large, but some people like to eat foreign drinks, which is very painful. You must know that the drink industry in our China is now making rapid progress compared to the past. For example, the fruit dew of Guanshengyuan, the Family Industrial Cooperative, and the Taikang Canned Food Company, the soda of Yili, the fresh milk of Shengsheng, and ice cream, etc., are their manufacturing processes clean and hygienic? What are the shortcomings of foreign goods? Therefore, here, I would like to sincerely advise my fellow compatriots that we should still use our own national goods for summer drinks. You must know that when you eat foreign drinks, you always feel a little uneasy in your heart. When you eat Chinese drinks, the rights and interests will not flow out, and how comfortable and at ease is the spirit?</p>
<p>The above three small opinions are my contribution to my fellow compatriots who purchase summer supplies. I don't know if my humble opinion can get some sympathy?</p>

<p>Mr. Yang is twenty-eight years old this year and works in the transportation department, with a good monthly income. He married Ms. Liu, a high-achieving student from Chongde Women's School, who is twenty-two years old, in March of this year. Mr. Yang used to be a Western-style friend, with fashionable clothes. Almost everything he needed was selected from imported goods, from the felt hats and straw hats on his head to the hair water and sedan Kang, and down to the patterned socks and leather shoes. They were all authentic imports, because he thought that national goods could not satisfy people. However, since his marriage, he has not bought any more Western suits. This summer, he wears silk gauze and small boat long gowns and short shirts and trousers. The shoes are gauze shoes, white socks, and a national goods straw hat. When I first saw him, I really couldn't recognize him. Since I met him, I had never seen him wear Chinese clothes. At this time, he was graceful, gentle and refined, and looked better than when he wore a suit. However, I finally asked him: "Oh, Ah Yang! What's wrong? You've also changed your style!"</p>
<p>"Actually, Chinese shirts are much more comfortable to wear! And they are also very cool."</p>
<p>"But what is the motive for you to change to Chinese clothes?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It's patriotism!" His face turned a little red. "My woman insisted that I change to Chinese clothes, saying that this way I can promote national goods. She also told me not to buy any more Western suits in the future, saying that I don't look good in Western suits, and the raw materials are mostly from foreign countries, which makes people earn our money."</p>
<p>"She is indeed patriotic, but what kind of cloth does she wear herself?"</p>
<p>"It's all Chinese fabrics. She opposes buying any beautiful foreign yarn. Not only are the clothes like this, but even the cosmetics are not foreign. She doesn't use "White Man" head water, "4711" perfume, or "Three Flowers Brand" flour and rouge. She only buys cheap and good-quality national goods."</p>
<p>"That's it. Your wife is definitely more sensible than you."</p>
<p>"Sensible is sensible, but she is also too meticulous. When she gets something in her hands, she has to ask if it is Chinese goods, like an inspection committee member. The things used at home are limited to me to buy Chinese goods. If it is a foreign product, it is not allowed to enter the door, and she wants me to take it back to return it at night, with no room for discussion. Now all the things used at home have been handled entirely by her."</p>
<p>I have visited his house several times. Except for a foreign wardrobe that Mr. Yang bought in the past, a dozen sets of Western suits, two pairs of old foreign leather shoes, a raincoat, and a phonograph, I can't find any other foreign goods. I really praised Mrs. Yang a few words, and she also invited me to drink a bottle of national goods soda.</p>
<p>I really admire Mrs. Yang more and more. In this Shanghai beach, where vanity is especially important, women (especially educated women) tend to admire Westernization and become powerful users of foreign goods. Mrs. Yang has corrected this problem, set an example, influenced her husband, and fulfilled a little of the national duty. She is truly a 100% virtuous wife!</p>
<p>I wrote this article with the consent of Mr. and Mrs. Yang. I hope that many wives will come up with good ideas and tricks to influence those Westernized husbands. If you also like to use foreign goods, then wake up immediately and take Mrs. Yang as a model. If it is not a national product, you are not allowed to bring it into the house. If everyone can really implement this, the Chinese national goods industry will have a savior, and the Chinese economic crisis can be avoided. From today, I wish many women to be determined to be a virtuous wife who knows the times!</p>
<h3 id="e213">A Record of Visiting the China Enamel Factory <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ya</p>
<p>If you pay attention to the trademarks of the enamelware sold on the market, you will definitely see the Lihuo brand porcelain that is comparable to Western goods. Because it is cheap and good, it has indeed won a lot of glory for the national goods industry. So we invited five friends to visit the "Lihuo Brand Porcelain" Manufacturing Institute - China Enamel Factory. Led by a Mr. Wang, he explained it to us very clearly.</p>
<p>We first walked into the blank making workshop. This is the place where the initial work is done. The iron sheet is made into various models of blanks on the blank cutting machine. There is also an acid washing room and a raw firing room. The blank is washed with dilute acid and then refined in the raw firing place.</p>
<p>The powder making workshop can also be divided into five places. This is dedicated to making enamel powder. At the first place, the whole piece of stone is placed in a rolling machine and rolled into fine powder. At the second place, the technician will match the various raw materials to the required materials. The third place is to put the matched fine powder in the kiln for forging and burning, but in order to prevent the solidified fine powder from occurring after forging and burning, it is added with water at the fourth place and the water room. The fifth place is the storage place. We also went to the factory to visit. Many workers used dilute acid to wash the blanks clean. Secondly, a layer of viscous substance was applied on the blanks, and then a layer of enamel porcelain was added. Then it was placed in the fire for forging and burning three times. After forging and burning, it was added with flowers in the art workshop. This is painted with various colors to arouse the customer's love for beauty. There are three ways to add flowers: (1) Sticking flowers, (2) Spraying flowers, (3) Oil painting. In short, they are all made by scientific methods. After adding the flowers, it is forged and burned once. Then it can be packaged. However, according to Mr. Wang, they also need to conduct a strict inspection before it is released to the market. We know that crude manufacturing is on the road to extinction. Factories that work hard on national goods will not be like this.</p>
<p>Many of their raw materials are taken from domestic products, such as sulfuric acid, soda ash, and feldspar. However, there are several types, such as iron sheet and cobalt oxide, which still have to rely on countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. This point needs to be paid attention to by the government!</p>
<p>The factory has about 300 workers, who work very diligently. It can be seen that great attention is paid to the training of workers at ordinary times. When I walked out of the gate of the China Enamel Factory, my heart was full of happiness. Mr. Wang's last words were still in my ears: "In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the total number of foreign enamelware imported into China was about 5 million yuan per year. Now, almost all of it is used by national goods."</p>
<h3 id="e214">Thoughts on the 20th Anniversary of Rendan <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Everyone has a very deep impression of the national goods Dragon and Tiger brand Rendan! I remember that twenty years ago, only "Rendan" and "Diamond" toothpaste were popular on the market. Diamond has been replaced by the "Invincible Brand" of the Family Industrial Cooperative. Now, national goods Rendan has been popular for twenty years. If the amount of money saved by this small drug over the years is calculated, it would be really amazing!</p>
<p>The reason why the sales of Rendan are so developed! The reason why national goods are loved by compatriots is that the "Rendan" parent company, Sino-French Pharmaceutical Factory, is a joint effort of the government and the public, and a win-win enterprise. For example, Mr. Chu Minyi, who is famous for Tai Chi, promoted it, and Mr. Xu Xiaochu and others worked hard for the business! Mr. Chu's "Dragon" and "Tiger" spirit! Especially admired by everyone! How can the 20th anniversary of "Rendan" be so lucky?</p>
<p>Wonderful! The speech of Ms. Lu Lihua, a female athlete, "The purpose of running a sports school is to train students to be "dragon" and "tiger" like citizens. Once they have minor problems, they should be treated with "Dragon and Tiger Brand" Rendan..." Although it is inevitable that there are some contradictions, it is difficult to guarantee that some minor problems will not occur when forging a dragon and tiger like physique. Writing in the scene can be said to be "good at wording"! Secondly, the song "Strive for Commercial War" of the pharmacy is very worthy of being introduced to the country. It is recorded to fill my article,</p>
<p>"Comrades, let's get up, take up the promotion of national goods, look! The wound of the national goods is full of eyes! Listen! The shocking waves of foreign goods import surplus! Do we want to choose "war" or "surrender"?</p>
<p>We want to cooperate in production and sales, and we will win in the business world. We want to actively work hard. "Dragon and Tiger Rendan" is an example. After 20 years of hard work and stubborn resistance, we invite you all to gather together today, please work together to wake up the nation and save ourselves! Publicity... constantly growing.</p>
<p>Comrades! Comrades! Hurry up and take out your strength to take up the promotion of national goods.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Introducing a Drink <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Binghun</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of drinks, there have been several discussions in this publication; indeed, in this hot summer, drinks are almost needed by everyone, because its sales are huge, so it is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>I remember a gentleman said: "Drinking foreign drinks is drinking the blood of our countrymen." Although this is a bit stimulating, various foreign drinks flood the market, and hundreds of millions of dollars flow into the hands of foreigners every year from this item. Can this not make us heartbroken?</p>
<p>To be fair, if the Chinese people can drink water and think of the source, and no longer purchase foreign drinks, then national drinks can also be supplied to the Chinese people. I can now introduce a national drink, which is the vegetable seed dew of the Wuzhou Pharmacy. This product is very clean. It is mixed with cold boiled water for drinking to quench thirst and relieve heat; and one bottle can be divided into multiple drinks, which is more economical.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor: My humble work "Improving Coarse Paper" was published in the National Goods Weekly on July 18, which has attracted much attention from those engaged in the grass paper industry. However, the symbols in the equation are misplaced, and the addition is mistaken for multiplication, which has led to questions. Please correct them as follows:</p>
<p>The original draft of the first formula is translated as potassium dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide three, light dioxide plus calcium dioxide is equal to calcium carbon dioxide three plus two parts of potassium dioxide (ie caustic potash)</p>
<p>The original draft of the second formula is translated as calcium (light oxide) two, plus two parts of sodium green is equal to calcium green two, plus two parts of sodium light oxide (ie caustic soda)</p>
<p>Those who inquired in the letter said that the second formula was impossible, but in fact, salt leachate also contains magnesium green two and magnesium sulfur oxide four, which are easily decomposed in caustic potash solution. Its green is attracted by caustic potash, so it dissociates and becomes an electrolytic ion. Therefore, the material must be heated during cooking, which is the same as the principle of electrolysis.</p>
<p>Also, it is proposed to add a note above the sentence "If it is filtered with a bamboo sieve to form a cake" (If rice straw is expensive, add one jiao per hundred jin, then add only five yuan per ton. If other materials are used, the same applies.) The reason is that the price of raw materials varies from place to place. Some people who sent letters said it was impossible, but in fact, the price of grass is at most two jiao more expensive, which is only thirty-four yuan per ton, which is not done, not impossible. The reason for the lack of prosperity of my country's industry is due to the hoarding of raw materials, which is very annoying! Tian Xu I am born with respect.</p>
<p>One Week's National Goods News</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee's organizational regulations, detailed rules for handling affairs, and detailed rules for lending have been revised and approved by the Ministry of Finance. Five million yuan will be used to help industrial and commercial mortgage loans, which will be implemented starting from August 1.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce approved the letter from the Spanish Consulate General requesting the introduction of a large number of agricultural products and handicrafts for sale. Exporters can contact the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The sales of Chinese firecrackers in New York are declining day by day. The main reason is that Chinese firecrackers are not improved, while the manufacturing of firecrackers in Europe and the United States is becoming more sophisticated and has more patterns, which makes them pale in comparison. As a result, sales have plummeted.</p>

<p>— (Pian Yue)</p>
<p>Walking with a bowl full of soup, focusing on preventing the soup from spilling, holding the bowl firmly with both hands, staring intently at the soup, and walking slowly and carefully, still results in quite a bit of soup spilling out. If you hold the bowl level with one hand, focus on the road ahead, and casually take care of any potential issues, the result will definitely be better – sometimes the bowl is full and no soup spills out at all. Many things in life are like this: if you are overly concerned about success and failure and deliberately seek success, it is better to do things step by step without any worries, which is easier to achieve.</p>
<p>The word "present" in "presenting a report on unusual movements" and the word "order" in "ordering commendation" – if these class-dividing terms are used, the spirit of "officials in a republic are servants of the people" will ultimately be obscured and lost.</p>
<p>Various fresh flowers are kept in vases, which can make the room full of spring and make everyone happy. However, the water in the vase that keeps the flowers is poisonous enough to kill people. When people appreciate the precious vases and beautiful flowers, how can they care about the hidden dangers in the contents! Throughout history, those who have been obsessed with female beauty and ultimately suffered from it have only seen the vases and flowers in their eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e217">The Method of Concentrating the Mind <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>All the joys and sorrows in life are created by the mind. If one can take a step back in one's thinking, one will realize that there are others in the world who suffer even more than oneself. In situations that are beyond one's control, even death may be unattainable, as in the unjust imprisonment of Yue Fei. Try to put yourself in their shoes and imagine, what would you do if you were to suffer the same pain? Dwell on this thought until death, and even beyond. This will illuminate the mind with great brilliance. Not only does the physical body not belong to me, but even the mind does not belong to me. The thought of "I" is what creates the "I." If the mind is without thought in sleep, then there is no "I." This is evident in the use of hypnotics for surgery. The "forgetting" in "sitting in oblivion" (坐忘) comes from "death" and "mind" (亡 and 心). "Death" means "nothingness." The "breath" in "regulating the breath" (調息) comes from "self" and "mind" (自 and 心). "Self" means "original." Originally, there was nothing. All that is seen and heard arises from nothingness. People may attribute it to Heaven, but in reality, Heaven itself is also originally nothing. All the winds, clouds, thunder, rain, sun, moon, and stars come together naturally, just like human affairs. They are not controlled by the will of Heaven, with its preferences and rejections. Therefore, I believe that the term "natural" (自然) is more fitting than "Heavenly" (天然). Rather than listening to Heaven, it is better to listen to nature. To "listen" means to perceive with the ears and create sound, which is still created by the mind. If the mind is not present, then one hears without hearing. Thus, the realm created by the mind exists only in a single thought. The character "thought" (念) comes from "now" (今), and "now" is just a single instant. Monks chanting the name of Buddha are chanting the two characters "not person" (弗人). Instead of thinking of oneself as a person, they only think of themselves as Buddha, thereby extinguishing all thoughts of suffering. Reciting the Heart Sutra (心經) means thinking about the path that the mind must take, crossing from this shore to the other shore. The "other shore" means escaping the present situation and imagining a transition. Like death, the physical body will inevitably decay, so why cherish it? Those who are oppressed by hunger, cold, and suffering are merely enslaved by the physical form. Therefore, I created the theory of the "mind's electricity," using a radio receiver as an analogy. The sounds broadcast in the air are not controlled by me, but I can choose to accept or reject them. The human mind is indeed more powerful than the mind of Heaven. Therefore, one who dislikes the sound of crying can immediately change direction and seek laughter and joy. If it is not satisfactory, one has the right to turn it off and stop it. However, if the direction is uncertain and wavering, it will create a chaotic sound, merely disturbing one's own mind. Therefore, I believe that the method of concentrating the mind lies only in the single character "stop" (止). All other explanations are merely superfluous words.</p>

<p>The late Polish national hero, General Józef Piłsudski, dedicated his life to fighting for his country's salvation, and his achievements are well-known throughout the world. Anecdotes about his life are scattered in newspapers at home and abroad, all of which are worthy of admiration. Piłsudski strived for his country's independence and freedom, and advocated for gender equality. During the revolutionary process, the secret military organizations under Piłsudski's leadership all had female divisions, responsible for assassination, sanitation, propaganda, and military administrative liaison work. During the European War, Polish women were even more active. Piłsudski's wife was then the intelligence director of the First Brigade of the Polish Volunteer Army. Their friendship developed into marriage. Therefore, after Poland's restoration, men and women were completely equal, with female members of parliament, female senators, female members of various political parties, female scientists, artists, writers, musicians, etc. Miss Ira Kowalska, Piłsudski's private female secretary, is one of Poland's most famous female writers. Last year, she won the Polish literary prize, worth about four thousand Chinese dollars. Miss Kowalska is famous for writing domestic narrative novels. Her writing is concise and detailed, seemingly plain at first glance, but with endless aftertastes. Her descriptions of daily life and personal character are particularly comprehensive and captivating, resembling the style of the Dream of the Red Chamber. Miss Kowalska was born in 1891 in Wilno, Poland. She studied at Kraków and Oxford University in England. During the war, she also served in Piłsudski's Volunteer Army as a frontline nurse, repeatedly receiving medals. From 1918 to 1926, she worked in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When Piłsudski regained power and became the Minister of Military Affairs, she was transferred to the Ministry of Military Affairs to serve in the military and concurrently as Piłsudski's private secretary. Many important documents and telegrams were written by her and widely circulated. Miss Kowalska's first work was completed in 1912. In 1930, she won the literary prize of Wilno. In 1933, she was elected as a professor at the Polish Academy of Literature, but she declined due to her military position. Last year, she received another military medal. She was highly valued by Piłsudski. Miss Kowalska's literary fame was enhanced by being the secretary of a national hero, and she was praised throughout Europe, becoming a celebrated story in the literary world.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor: Respectfully, Suzhou's Mudu area once tried to operate rickshaws in April of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1933], but due to sluggish business, it was canceled after ten days of operation. Currently, the only form of land transportation is the mountain sedan chair. Although rickshaws are occasionally seen, they are brought in from Suzhou city for long-distance trips and are absolutely not allowed to stay and operate in the town. Therefore, there are no rickshaws available for hire at the Mudu pier. Today, I read Mr. Wu Zhifei's article "Climbing Lingyan After the Rain" published in your column on July 8th, in which one section says, "When we arrived at the Mudu boat dock, the sky had cleared after the rain, but the streets were still muddy; fortunately, the dock was not too far from our destination, so twelve copper coins could get a rickshaw to pull us to the door." This clearly does not conform to the facts, and I hope you will correct it immediately. Zhang Boyong, respectfully.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Where is this... I... I can hardly believe it, I really can hardly believe it." My father kept lamenting like this, saying it over and over again, I don't know how many times.</p>
<p>Even the Empress Dowager also felt that this was an unbelievable thing! After she hurriedly read those documents, she commented on them with Prince Qing as if in casual conversation. At that time, I was listening with my ears cocked, and I actually understood every word.</p>
<p>"We can't understand it no matter what," she said, "Someone like ××, born of such noble origins, and relying on the blessings of his ancestors, associating with nothing but princes and nobles, his position could not be higher; moreover, the imperial court trusts him so much, entrusting the military and civilians of the entire province to him, who would have thought that he would do so many scandalous things? This is really hard to believe! I don't believe that someone like him, if he had a clear head and put his conscience in the middle, would do any disreputable bad things; it is clear that his head is too muddled and his conscience is not in the middle, that's why this happened!"</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's saying "conscience in the middle," explained in modern terms, means first, loyalty; second, integrity; third, trustworthiness; and fourth, a kind and benevolent attitude towards everyone.</p>
<p>Next, the Empress Dowager specifically raised the charge of his condoning his servants to whip a beggar to death for discussion. (374)</p>

<p>He even had to squeeze into other people's affairs of buying concubines, just to curry favor. That's how he got Jia Duocai to call him twice last night, and actually got things moving a little bit. He's the kind of petty person who goes mad when he gets a little power. He puts on a mandarin jacket and hat, and walks around all over the place. I really can't stand looking at this kind of person. From today on, I'm not talking to him. Zhiqian laughed: Why bother? In the world of mixing things up outside, everyone has their own tricks. Li Shilian said: What tricks? Just being vulgar. He can actually do such vulgar things, a damned turtle... Before he could finish, Qian deliberately laughed loudly. Coincidentally, Zhang Jiefu came back. Because his hat and mandarin jacket were in Zhiqian's room, he came in smiling and said: A person might not get a chance even after waiting for three years. But once there's a chance, opportunities come flooding in. What are you talking about? Mr. Lan Zaitian is here. Zhiqian said: That Lan Zaitian? The name sounds familiar. Jiefu raised his hands and said: A very famous person, how can you forget? He's the Northwest Investigation Commissioner of the Central Investigation Bureau. There's a phone call from Tongguan, telling Little Western Heaven to prepare three rooms. I told the chief accountant that the arrival of the Central Commissioner is a boost to Little Western Heaven's reputation, and they should put up some welcome banners at the gate. It doesn't cost much, but the effect is great. The accountant is just a businessman, he's not open-minded and doesn't want to do it. So I told him that this commissioner and I are somewhat related... Before he finished speaking, Li Shi... was in the next room, grumbling... Jiefu, saying... he ran over and... laughed: Mr. Jiefu, are you related to Commissioner Lan? What? Jiefu laughed: There's no need to announce it. Those who know me will say I'm telling the truth, those who don't will think I'm climbing the social ladder, making things up. It's better for me not to say. But he'll be here tomorrow, and when he comes, he can prove what I said. (274)</p>

<h3 id="e222">Japan, A Self-Confessed Earthquake Country <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>Having lived in Japan for less than half a year, I have already experienced more than a dozen earthquakes. And because of the great earthquake in Taiwan last month, all Japanese residents are uneasy and worried about a major disaster looming. Japan has a great military force, but it can absolutely not stop earthquakes. There are also countless brilliant scientists who are immersed in research, but there is still no good industry for forecasting and preventing it. Newspapers say, "Japan is a famous earthquake country, and three or four minor tremors every month are a normal phenomenon. Although there have been six earthquakes in June, general observations show no unexpected danger, and residents do not need to worry." How can these irrelevant words reduce people's fear? Because in fact, the smoke from Mount Asama has not yet been extinguished!</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Japan, I really wanted to experience an earthquake and see how it felt. Because since I was born in China, I have never encountered an earthquake. The opportunity suddenly came. On the day of the great earthquake in Taiwan, it was around one or two in the morning, and I was awakened by the earthquake. The house shook very violently, rattling as if it were about to collapse. My body trembled up and down, left and right, as if I were on a train. At the same time, my head was slightly dizzy, like seasickness. I wanted to get up and take refuge, but there was no sound of birds outside, so I had to endure it. When I saw in the newspaper the next morning that there had been a slight tremor in Tokyo, I was startled. This kind of earthquake, which is extremely rare in China, is not a big deal in Japan and doesn't need to be fussed about. From this, it can be seen that the time of a strong earthquake must be very frightening.</p>
<p>Even a slight earthquake makes us restless on our pillows. I don't want to experience a stronger earthquake again. In the museum, I saw a train locomotive from the time of the earthquake, burned into several iron rods. Ironware and glass were melted into lumps. If it were humans, they would surely be reduced to flying bones and scattered ashes, without a trace. But after several earthquakes, I have gained some scientific experience. I feel that the vibration of an earthquake, like a ripple, has a pattern of expanding from the center point (epicenter) to the surrounding area. It becomes circular. The farther away from the center point, the weaker the impact, until it disappears. Moreover, this kind of ring-shaped vibration wave, sometimes strong and sometimes weak, is also the same as sound waves. Therefore, an earthquake can be divided into several times in the middle. Most of the time, I experience six or seven movements in ten minutes.</p>
<p>In places with many earthquakes and volcanoes, the earth's crust is thinner, so tall Western-style houses cannot be built. The soil in Japan is also loose, and the passage of streetcars and cars makes the houses and land on both sides vibrate. The tallest buildings in the country are nine stories high, and the state restricts them from being built taller to avoid danger. Therefore, they have to develop underground. Most of the larger buildings have basements, which serve as public dining halls. Recently, a certain company in Marunouchi (street name) is building a seven-story building. It uses compressed air to inject into the ground to consolidate the foundation. Who knew that the ground in the nearby people's houses would spew out foul odors. It was later discovered that the air injected underground by a certain company was spraying out in all directions because the soil was too loose. It carried underground impurities, so it became a slightly toxic foul odor. After opposition from the neighbors, construction was suspended. Japanese people want to compete with Europe and America in everything, but only in buildings can they not show their strength. They often envy Shanghai, which can build twenty or thirty-story buildings.</p>
<p>Nine out of ten ordinary houses are made of wood. There are no bricks in the walls, only wooden strips nailed together, with some gray sand or cement painted on the outside. So the appearance is very beautiful artificial stone, but the inside is mud and straw. There are no walls or partitions in the house, only thin doors covered with cloth, and the window frames and doors move to both sides. The delicate wooden strips can be broken with some force. The walls around the house are also mostly wooden boards. So it is easy to burn in case of a fire. Fortunately, Japan pays great attention to fire prevention, and people's homes generally have fire extinguishing liquid, so there are not many cases of dozens of houses being burned.</p>
<p>Because of the frequent earthquakes, the tiles on the roof are only one layer and are very thin. Recently, zinc is popular, which can reduce the weight even more. Their houses are not connected to the foundation. Wooden frames are placed on top of the foundation stones, and the houses are built on the wooden frames. If a crane is used to lift it up, it can be moved or changed direction at will. We live in the attic in Shanghai, and we often complain about the heavens and the earth. Who knew that the houses in Japan are all like birdcages. Because of the problem of living, they are often threatened by earthquakes, so they have to seek development abroad. This is also an important reason.</p>

<h3 id="e223">On "Critiquing Books and Critiquing People" <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lingjing's article "Critiquing Books and Critiquing People" in "Free Talk": "As long as the critic (reveals that they know more about the author than the book can tell them, their denunciation immediately becomes an attack, and their ridicule becomes an insult." I quite disagree. Mr. Lingjing thinks this statement is quite "correct," but in my opinion, it is not very correct. Mr. Lingjing believes that "the responsibility that a writer should bear when writing an article or reading a book is, strictly speaking, only the article or the book itself. No matter how wildly promiscuous, gambling, base, or despicable the author's daily life is, the critic should only look for "toxic" or "beneficial" elements in the book. As for the author's behavior, the critic doesn't need to worry about it. Social morality and national laws will naturally impose sanctions." It seems that Mr. Lingjing agrees with "evaluating the work based on the work" and does not agree with "evaluating the work based on the person" and "evaluating the person based on the work." But in fact, things are probably not that simple. Right now, we can see a group of self-proclaimed lofty hermits "whose hearts are the same as merchants," as well as scholars who are like "a lone crane in the clouds, flying back and forth to the prime minister's office, everywhere "scrounging for favors." When they open their mouths and pick up their pens, they are always talking about "unrestrained," "unfettered," and "free-spirited," making grand pronouncements about reality and fiercely scolding everything that is base and dirty, as if they are the only "noble" ones in the world. In society or in the "literary circle," we also often encounter a body wrapped in a tailcoat with second-stage syphilis, righteously denouncing people's prostitution? At this time, the critic has no choice but to "evaluate the person based on the person" or "evaluate the person based on the work," stripping him naked and letting the audience see what he really is. Because if you are still polite and "evaluate the work based on the work" at this time, then you will fall for his trick. He might even secretly laugh at you as an "A.Q." This is why people today should not be too honest, and "treating people with sincerity" should be based on the other party's attitude. Moreover, there are too many people with "double personalities" now, and comparing "words" with "deeds" has become an indispensable weapon. Therefore, "evaluating the person based on the work" and even "evaluating the work based on the person" are often unavoidable. Not long ago, we encountered those well-fed and well-clothed Beijing-style famous scholars who scolded people who write for a living for "having low character and low literary style." At this time, he does not treat you "sincerely," but you stubbornly want to treat him "sincerely." In the end, you always suffer. As a result, not only is it impossible to treat him with sincerity, but it is also impossible not to treat him with sincerity. So, when it comes to "treating people with sincerity," it is best to see the opponent clearly. If they are not worthy of being treated with "sincerity," then everyone doesn't need to bow and scrape and be polite. It's not too late to treat him with "sincerity" until he also treats people with "sincerity." In short, you can't just be "sincere" all the way. On this point, I agree with "treating a person in the same way they treat others."</p>

<p>— Qi Wuwen</p>
<p>By chance, I circled around the north again. Judging from the train cars on the three northern lines, the third-class carriages of the Beining Railway are indeed a bit different from those on the Jinpu Railway or the Pinghan Railway. They are filled with "lowlifes" living inhuman lives—dirty farmers and simple small merchants. But here, there are already some "upper-class society" figures decorating it, and there are also Japanese and Korean faces interspersed among them. Therefore, even the length of the backrests and the height of the chair backs are decent. Take my surroundings as an example: next to me is a Korean woman with a flat face dressed in Chinese fashion. Sitting across from me is a middle-aged man in a Western suit. From his burly figure, prominent cheekbones, and stiff northern accent, I know that he is also Korean. The other one is Chinese—a young woman in her twenties. When I entered the station, she was running behind me, catching up to ask me which concession the ×× Hotel was in Tianjin. Her face is thin and has the color given by anemia. Her deep-set and dark eyes, and the scarred bridge of her nose, suggest that she is a precocious woman who has experienced worry. Her attire is ordinary student attire—a gray cloth qipao with an old raincoat, short socks with mud stains, and wide-toed flat leather shoes. Besides a small hand-carried soft wicker basket, she brought nothing else.</p>
<p>After we sat down, she continued to ask me whether she should get off at the old station or the new station. Then she automatically explained to me why she was going to a hotel in Tianjin:</p>
<p>"I'm going to Tianjin to find my brother. My brother had a fight with my sister-in-law and left home in a huff. My father isn't free, so I have to make a trip." Her accent is a typical Beijing female student accent, speaking very quickly. When she speaks, the muscles in her face and mouth move vigorously, expressing herself a bit too much.</p>
<p>Besides asking her how she knew where her brother was, I only replied with a hm-hm.</p>
<p>"His friend sent us a telegram." When she heard me speaking with a southern accent, she asked me where I was from. After I told her, I felt embarrassed not to ask her where her home was. She told me that she was from Jiangxi, but had lived in Beijing for many years. Her father worked in the Social Affairs Bureau in Beijing. She had also "stayed" in Shanghai for some time, and had only been to Tianjin once. Then she went from the differences between northern and southern dialects to issues such as northerners being dirtier than southerners.</p>
<p>I've never met a young woman like this who starts talking to strangers as soon as she meets them. Although I didn't get to the bottom of it, I didn't dislike her. I just felt that she was a bit different, but at the same time I felt that she was natural. In front of her, I was ashamed that I was showing the shyness and unnaturalness of a woman. But she didn't notice this and continued to talk to me intermittently. —Yes, she had also tried to strike up a conversation with the Korean woman sitting next to me, but because she didn't understand Chinese, she had to talk to me alone.</p>
<p>When a vendor selling cigarettes and candies passed by, she bought a pack of "Hong Xibao." She rummaged through the basket for a long time before taking out two dimes to give him. She first offered me a cigarette, but I repeatedly declined, saying that I didn't smoke.</p>
<p>"I thought you smoked, that's why I bought it. I don't smoke myself," but later she smoked several herself.</p>

<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>My sixty-three-year-old mother, my wife suffering from lung disease, and my two frail, malnourished children, threatened by famine, floods, and a heartless environment, fled miserably from our hometown more than three thousand *li* away, hoping to rely on me, their son, husband, and father, whose monthly income from writing was only a little over ten *yuan*.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived, they were busy recounting the hardship in our hometown and taking medicine.</p>
<p>Because an elder sister with four or five children was left behind in our hometown, my mother would always sigh with an expression of being quite content with her vagrant life:</p>
<p>"We are still doing alright! Although it's hard, the whole family is together! … Only your sister, I don't know if their settlement has collapsed or not? Such a family that can't survive! … She should have written a letter long ago…"</p>
<p>Bending her withered fingers, she counted: six days, eight days… How many tears she secretly shed behind our backs, my wife and I didn’t know—longing for that letter of safety.</p>
<p>One morning, during heavy rain, my mother stayed up all night praying to Buddha for my wife's heavy coughing and cries of pain, and then fell asleep. The mailman delivered a letter from the back door with postage due, and after paying him eight *fen* in copper coins, I hid in the kitchen annex and hurriedly opened it.</p>
<p>The handwriting was blurred, and both the envelope and the paper were made of straw paper. Even before reading it, I knew the contents would definitely not be good. The words were not written with an ink brush, nor with a pencil, but perhaps with a charred twig. I remembered playing a game with my sister in childhood, writing with charred twigs, and maybe she hadn't forgotten and improvised it.</p>
<p>My hands were shaking as I read the letter, still worrying about my mother and wife waking up. The child had already started crying, so I picked her up and put her beside me, giving her a pair of chopsticks to play with. As I read the letter, the child tapped the washbasin with the chopsticks, singing a begging song popular among famine victims from our hometown.</p>
<p>The settlement, as expected, had collapsed. My sister's letter was written while crouching on a stone in the barren hills. She said:</p>
<p>“…That night, it was dark and without light, and the heavy rain almost broke through the roof. Your brother-in-law was called out by the gong to the dyke to rescue it, and I huddled in the middle of the main room with the five children, trembling as we waited for good news from those defending the dyke… We were not the only family not sleeping all night, but they were all burning incense, striking chimes, and crying out to Heaven to beg the bodhisattvas for help! …The dogs and livestock were howling, as if they knew a great disaster was imminent, searching everywhere for a place to settle… I tried my best to stop the children from crying! But the sound of gongs and rain grew louder and louder… Just as dawn broke, suddenly, from who knows where, there was an earth-shattering sound, and the floodwaters surged into our rice paddies and main room like an avalanche…</p>
<p>‘I don’t know what words to use to tell you about our suffering. In short, at that time, as soon as I saw the water, I cried out as if I had seen the messengers of death from hell! The children clung to me, and I couldn't run out the door to ask for help, and no one was willing to save us! Your brother-in-law couldn't come back either… In an instant, the water rose as high as the benches!… I carried the children one by one to the raised floor. You know our raised floor, it's only made of two planks… At noon, the water sealed our doors, and the raised floor was level with the water, so I could only dig open the roof and get the children onto the roof!…</p>
<p>‘The rain was still heavy, and we had nothing to shield us from the rain, and the wind was howling, and the waves sometimes reached as high as our roof. Our wet bodies waited until the sun came out to dry, sunburnt and dizzy, sunburnt and aching!… We endured on the roof for three whole days!… It wasn’t until the morning of the fourth day that we saw your brother-in-law coming in a broken rowing boat… One of the children, the youngest, died in my arms. Another—the third—Junxiang, was swept into the water by the waves at some point during the night! Perhaps he fainted from hunger and rolled into the water, without making a sound!…</p>
<p>‘Now, brother! I don't want to recount my suffering again. In short, you can imagine everything. You have experienced many floods yourself… We have now been transported to this barren mountain, which is full of disaster victims. Perhaps there are others among them who are suffering even more than we are! They are waiting all day for the relief officials to fly down from the sky. But for me, all hope is extinguished, because I have experienced too many floods, although this one was more severe than any other!…</p>
<p>‘Your brother-in-law hasn't had a drop of water or a grain of rice for five or six days, and he is burning with fever! But he said to me: "Go! Take the two youngest children and beg for food in Shanghai! You have studied and can read, maybe your brother can think of a way to help you!… Leave the older children to me, I only need to get a little better to catch fish!…" Brother, what can I say to answer him? I know. You yourself may not have a solution! Mother, your sick sister-in-law, and two children, and you have no job. Besides, we are not allowed to leave the region to beg for food…’"</p>
<p>As I read the letter, my nose stung, but I desperately tried to hold back my tears. My wife's coughing grew heavier, and I carried the child upstairs. My mother had already gotten up again and was pouring hot water for my wife. As soon as she saw me, she asked:</p>
<p>"Is that the letter? You were reading it downstairs…"</p>
<p>"Yes!" I said. Unable to hide it, I put the letter on the table; pretending she couldn't read, I said calmly, "It's good news from my sister. Their settlement didn't collapse!"</p>
<p>"Good news? Amitabha! …Heaven doesn't disappoint those who have a good heart!" my mother said, clasping her hands together, "Read it! Read it to me! Read it word by word!"</p>
<p>Forcing myself, I read aloud, and I felt that what I saw in my eyes was not straw paper, but a vast expanse of water, heaps and heaps of corpses of disaster victims! Among them were my sister, nephews, and even myself! But what came out of my mouth was a completely opposite, bountiful, unimaginable world. I said:</p>
<p>"She said, 'Tell Mother not to worry, thanks to the joint efforts of the officials and the people, our dyke didn't collapse!… Now the early rice is ripe, and I have harvested more than in any other year. The children are all very healthy too’…"</p>
<p>"That's great!" my mother smiled.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I secretly wrote a reply, saying a lot of hollow, comforting words that didn't scratch the surface of the pain, and used the last three *yuan* that I had borrowed to buy medicine for my wife to buy a postal money order.</p>
<p>"Maybe they won't even receive my three *yuan*!" Walking out of the post office, I suddenly thought sadly, and tears could no longer be held back.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Chang'e's Make-Up Exam <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Xueyin</p>
<p>After publishing "The Chinese Goddess of the Sun and Moon," I was bored during my illness, so I opened my reading notes and found that I had missed a lot of materials, which I greatly regretted. Among the most important were two items, the first of which is: Gao You had already said that Chang Yi became Chang'e. In "Lüshi Chunqiu Reviewing and Distinguishing," there are two sentences: "Xi He made divination of the sun, and Shang Yi made divination of the moon," and Gao You annotated:</p>
<p>"Shang Yi is Chang'e, so read Yi as He, and later generations had the vulgar name of Chang'e."</p>
<p>Regarding the earliest record of Chang'e flying to the moon that I have seen, it is in "Huainanzi Lanming Xun." The book "Huainanzi" was written by a group of alchemists, so the story of Chang'e flying to the moon is obviously a fabricated story, not a myth. In myths, people seem to have only known that rabbits or toads lived on the moon, and did not know that there was a Moon Granny. "Heavenly Questions" says:</p>
<p>"What virtue does the nocturnal light possess that it is reborn after death? What is its benefit that there is a hare in its belly?"</p>
<p>This is a myth that probably prevailed in the Jing and Xiang areas during the Warring States period. In Mexico, Zululald, and Tibet, there are similar stories. "Huainanzi Jing Shen Xun" says:</p>
<p>"There is a three-legged crow in the sun, and there is a toad in the moon."</p>
<p>"Shuo Lin Xun" also says:</p>
<p>"The moon shines on the world, eating in Chan Zhu."</p>
<p>Chan Zhu is a toad. It is also a toad. "Lüshi Chunqiu Ji Qiu Ji" says:</p>
<p>"The moon is the root of all Yin. When the moon is full, the clams are full, and the Yin is full; when the moon is dark, the clams are empty, and the Yin is lacking."</p>
<p>This myth is probably differentiated from the former one. This is treating the moon as a clam, the full moon is the full clam, and the dark moon is the empty clam.</p>
<p>According to the two sentences in "Reviewing and Distinguishing" that I cited, we also know that Xi He transformed into divination of the sun at the end of the Warring States period, and Chang Yi transformed into divination of the moon. However, Xi He was regarded as the sun driver, but Chang Yi was not regarded as the moon driver. The moon driver is a god called Wang Shu, only seen in the Chu Ci, which must have been a legend from the Jing and Xiang areas. Chang Yi has made divination of the moon, which is the second material I missed in the previous article.</p>
<p>Secondly, what should be added is: the moon's sisters (or brothers) are twelve, implying that this myth occurred after the twelve months were clearly divided, so it is thought to be no earlier than the Yin and Shang dynasties.</p>

<p>— Written by German Storm, Translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>The flowers have passed; now the road is no longer lined with elm trees, but with slender, tall birch trees. After walking for a while, I came to a cool forest, which grew straight up a hill on the left; on the other side, I could see the sea through the trees. In the densest part of the forest in front of me, there was the silver bell-like singing of thrushes and the charming calls of black cranes. In addition, I heard the rustling of leaves and the sound of sea waves surging underneath, like music. I suddenly remembered a half-old house, also in this forest. A few years ago, when I was still a sophomore, I came out of school to visit a college student who was related to me, and I went there with him. As far as I knew at that time, the house was built by a hotel owner who was engaged in speculative business; later, the speculation failed, and he could not attract many customers to this secluded place, so he had to sell the house. The new owner of the house only sent a servant to take care of the sparse business.</p>
<p>I still remember that the servant was a pale-faced, tall man; the single-story building was hidden among the towering birch trees on the hillside, and now it appeared very clearly in my mind. My first glass of Grog was still drunk under the small colonnade in the center of the front of the house, and from this colonnade, through a double door, one could reach a tall and dark hall, with windows facing the forest behind the hall. At this time, I became interested and wanted to revisit this secluded place, but at the same time, I was worried that the house no longer existed or could not be found.</p>
<p>As I was thinking this, I looked up and saw a narrow path winding up the hill from the left side of the road through the trees. I stood for a while, remembering that it was the same at that time, so I slowly walked up the hill along this path. After walking for a while, I saw a gray sloping roof appearing among the leaves in front of me, and slowly I could also see the tops of the two windows under the columns of a small colonnade. After a few more steps, a wide staircase led me from the shade of the trees to a flat little square.</p>
<p>The house stood before me in the secluded sunlight in the middle of the forest. Long time no see, it seemed that nothing had changed. The original light pink painted walls, in the part near the ground that had not peeled off, were still covered with green moss, just like then; the cracks in the wooden columns were filled with brown grass cores; now there were still two dark green benches on either side of the half-open double doors under the small colonnade. — I sat on a bench, watching the sea below through the gaps in the trees, at which time a fishing boat was sailing across the sea illuminated by the sunlight. — It seemed that no one lived here, everything was quiet; no sound came from the house behind me; only a wild bee flew past buzzing, and two black butterflies were flying in the grass beside the stone steps.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Germany Rearrests Jews <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power in Germany, an anti-Jewish movement soon occurred. At that time, Jews living in Germany suffered significant oppression. Some were exiled, some were imprisoned, and some were insulted. Afterwards, the National Socialist Party was quite satisfied, and the trend calmed down.</p>
<p>However, before the Jews had time to recover from their shock, Germany is now carrying out a second anti-Jewish movement. Moreover, the tension is even greater than the previous anti-Jewish movement.</p>
<p>This time, Germany's rearrest of Jews has become a widespread trend throughout the country. Disturbances have occurred in various places, and there have been several incidents. The other day, a movie theater in the western part of Berlin was showing an anti-Jewish film, and the Jewish people in the audience all hissed and left their seats, causing a riot. In addition, several National Socialist Party soldiers had a conflict with Jewish people walking on the street. At one point, the usually magnificent Kurfürstendamm was filled with noise. The National Socialist Party believed that the street was the center of the Jewish people, so they shattered many pieces of glass in the shops opened by Jewish people. At the same time, anti-Jewish incidents have also continued to occur in other cities.</p>
<p>Regarding this German rearrest of Jews, public opinion in various countries has been critical. However, according to General Daliu Qi, commander-in-chief of the German police, the German anti-Jewish movement is very legitimate. Daliu recently presented a detailed statistics of Jewish people committing crimes to the press, stating that based on the statistics, the number of crimes is the highest among Jewish residents. Foreign public opinion often cannot understand the German anti-Jewish movement. If foreigners could understand these statistics on Jewish people committing crimes, they would not only not side with the Jewish people, but would also pay attention to the crimes of the Jewish people in their own countries. And Xi said that the Jewish people who cause trouble live in Germany as if they were eating the land. But they don’t know how to be grateful for their residence. To the point of forgetting why they are here, they do not know how to examine their behavior at all, which is strange.</p>
<p>Alas, Jewish people eat the land but do not know how to repay the depth of kindness and sing praises, and they still do not know how to check themselves and repeatedly violate criminal laws. The Jewish people really do not know what time it is.</p>

<p>— Jingyun</p>
<p>When the nurse, with her neatly combed hair, came in to check my temperature for the last time, I lay in bed, uttering a weak, trembling voice, anxiously asking:</p>
<p>"Miss Shi, how is the temperature today?" How eager the desire to live!</p>
<p>"It's much better already. — But now you need to rest fully to calm your brain nerves; at night, don't let your mind wander." After saying that, she put the thermometer into the box and walked out of the room with a slight smile.</p>
<p>The air in the room was like that of a monastery, silent and solemn, and even the throbbing of my pulse could be heard faintly.</p>
<p>The sounds of insects singing chirped and chirped at the base of the wall, and the moon poured in through the window, its silvery light exceptionally bright and clean. Her silky silver light permeated the entire house, all the way to the depths of my heart lying on the bed, making it as clear and bright as the moon. This lonely and peaceful situation is like a mother's comfort to the patient, caressing an uneasy heart like the calm water lake in the deep mountains surrounded by peaks, calm without the slightest ripple of waves.</p>
<p>I lay flat on the bed, gazing foolishly at the silvery white moon shadow slowly crawling on the pale white wall. At this time, I did not feel depressed or lonely at all, but my heart felt suddenly enlightened. Everything is floating clouds, and so-called wealth and fame are just a wisp of ethereal smoke to life, so what is there to cherish? In the turbid human world, why should I try to gain advantage by scheming and fighting? I am deeply grateful that this minor illness has allowed my heart to abandon all the busywork and calm down. In this lonely and peaceful environment, I can close my eyes, calm my breathing, and leisurely savor some past events.</p>
<p>In fact, a person in the depths of illness will not always be so foolish as to think about those smoke-like fame and wealth, because he is gradually walking towards the realm of death, separated from the ghost by only a closed door, and there is always the possibility of entering. At this time, his heart is the most enlightened and peaceful. When he looks back on some things in the past, he will naturally feel amused and foolish in secret. If someone were to put fame and wealth next to his bed at this time, asking him to risk his life to fight for it, then he may not have such great courage; and what remains in his heart at this time is probably only a strong and urgent desire to live.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I was in the South—Siam—I also entered the Chulalongkorn Hospital of the royal family for treatment because of an illness. Whenever the sun collected its scorching rays, like a salted egg yolk resting on the treetops in the west, I leisurely dragged my light steps to the green lawn in the garden, sitting on a chair under the umbrella-like banyan tree, casually admiring the golden afterglow on the brilliant and sparkling spire of the Buddha "Viet" (temple), and the red clouds in the blue sky, and the flocks of small birds chirping and chirping back to their nests. At that time, I often met a middle-aged man with dark brown skin, a strong body, and an age of about twenty to forty in the garden, dragging a cane and circling on the grass, quite heroic, looking really unlike a patient. Soon, the two lonely patients finally struck up a conversation. Then I learned that he was an active military officer—a very famous colonel, who had been admitted to the hospital for treatment of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>"...With such a strong body as yours, and being a military officer, it doesn't seem like you should have this disease," I said. Speaking in a somewhat impure foreign language.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yun, (Mr. Yun) what is the difference between literary and military? A person's life is intoxicated by fame and wealth. For the so-called future of wealth and fame, who doesn't rack their brains to scheme and fight?..."</p>
<p>Several loud and heavy bell sounds were sent from the Buddha Viet, and the dim shadows of dusk seemed to be ambushing soldiers, slowly spreading out from all around.</p>
<p>"Life is just like this, wealth and fame are just a fleeting dream. It's better to be a carefree monk," he closed his eyes tightly, like a monk meditating in front of a Buddha statue.</p>
<p>Thinking of the colonel's words, I turned off the bedside lamp, and a bottle of lilac flowers on the windowsill was reflected on the pale white wall by the moon. I stared foolishly at the beautiful flower shadow on the wall, and fell asleep with a calm heart.</p>
<h3 id="e230">One of the Pleasures of Living in the City <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Tan</p>
<p>For people living in the city today, unless they are millionaires who can build an acre of garden on Jing'an Temple Road or Yu Yuan Road, salaried workers with limited monthly income really do not have the happiness of enjoying the vitality of a blade of green grass. In fact, this is entirely because they don't know how to arrange it themselves. If they put in a little effort, then even people with a monthly income of forty or fifty *yuan* can get some "flowers and trees."</p>
<p>I have planned it in detail, and I will write it below to contribute to the people living in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Of course, people without clothes and food are now flooding the city, and my plan is only for the sake of a few people.</p>
<p>First of all, we must choose the location to rent a house. In the downtown area, the rent is expensive, and there is too much noise, which often destroys the peaceful air. What is particularly important is that the lights are too bright at night, you stand in the courtyard and look up and you can't see a single star, and the moonlight like water will never soak your bitter steps.</p>
<p>If you don't have the ability to live in the entire building, it is best to find a way to rent the downstairs living room. Because if you rent the living room of a single building, the small courtyard will undoubtedly belong to you. This immediately removes about one and a half to two feet of the cement floor on both sides of the small courtyard. With a little manpower, it becomes two very good "medicinal railings." Then plant a very large rose flower in the corner of the right wall. Roses are very easy to cultivate, and at the same time, they often bloom. With this one, even when other flowers are not blooming, it will not be lonely. Plant a crabapple tree near the rose, whether it is a weeping crabapple or a Chinese quince. With its smearing of scarlet red, you can deal with this brocade-like spring. In addition, as long as you plant one or two more canna lilies and balsam in this medicinal railing on the right, there will be flowers to see in the hot summer and early autumn. On the left, a *Nandina domestica* cannot be forgotten. It is an evergreen tree, and even in the severe cold of snow, it is green and lovely. Camellias, like coral-like seeds and the same root, make a bleak winter very lively. Of course, cotton roses cannot but be planted. His appearance of melancholy in the wind and dew is really the soul of autumn, and the blue begonias in the cracks of the wall can brew a strong autumn flavor in the late autumn with melancholy rain and wind. With these kinds of flowers and trees, there are decorations in all seasons of the year.</p>
<p>In the spring, the windows are wide open, and the spring scenery in the courtyard is for me to write and paint. In the summer, you must not forget to hang green bamboo curtains outside the long windows. It can not only isolate the sunlight and heat, but also give you the pleasure of being immersed in water. On autumn evenings, the courtyard is filled with moonlight, and the cool dew drips. A weaving lady on the balsam keeps calling. You turn off the lights in the room, and look out from the bamboo curtain. The canna lilies are graceful in the wind and lovely. At this time, you lean on the sofa, pour a cup of bitter tea, and sip it slowly. At this time, the scenery is really unknown whether it is poetry or a dream. In winter, it is best on a snowy night. You close the windows tightly, letting the cold light of the accumulated snow reflect from the glass. When there is wine, you sip the wine. When there is no wine, you can sip boiled water. If there is a stove, you naturally start a fire. If there is no stove, you wrap the thread quilt around your body.</p>
<p>The best is of course a rainy day, especially the continuous autumn rain. Friend, you may not know the benefits of a rainy day. It makes you secluded, it makes you quiet, it makes you deep. Of course, it will also make you sad, but this sadness is light and vague. At this time, it is best to lie idly on the bed, reading books that do not cost money. When you are tired, put the book aside and look out of the window to see the thin strands and strips of drizzle falling patiently and weakly. The begonias can't stand even this drizzle, and they hang their heads and think deeply. At that time, you can also follow him to think, from world affairs all the way to life until you are too hungry to get out of bed in slippers and go somewhere to eat.</p>
<h3 id="e231">The Sorrow of Old Age <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Er</p>
<p>The nursing room gradually became desolate and quiet. Even the heavy cough of the old man in the nursing room, usually heard, couldn't be heard by the children outside the house this early spring.</p>
<p>The village had become quite chaotic in recent years. The old man of the nursing room, Second Grandfather, once regarded as the most respected, had been forgotten by the villagers in recent years. Especially the young people, sometimes encountering him by the door or in the alley, didn't even feel like saying "Third Grandfather" or even nodding. This old man's uneasy later years were compounded by an indescribable pain, making his face always anxious, gloomy, and rarely speaking. This spring, he finally fell ill from accumulated worry and suffering, which made him even more sorrowful. How could the villagers not even know about his serious illness? No one came to inquire.</p>
<p>One spring, the old man had a nightmare of going through the gates of hell. He was certain he would die this time, but he was still alive. Moreover, he was even able to leave the room and sit on the armchair in the center of the hall, which he hadn't touched for months. As soon as he sat down, his thirteen-year-old daughter was about to massage his back, but he already felt a burst of soreness all over. Clearly, it was caused by some emotion.</p>
<p>The old man stared with blurry, unfocused eyes, silently looking at the courtyard in front. Many star fruit tree leaves were scattered there, rotten star fruits turned black, withered black star fruit branches, desolate, enveloped in a layer of decaying and desolate atmosphere. He slowly shifted his gaze, and on the dilapidated black tiled roof opposite, a lonely wind that made the old man's heart tremble lightly blew, sweeping through the leaves of the star fruit tree in the lazy courtyard, faintly rustling in the quiet. The old man's heart was like a string about to break, plucked by something that made him unbearable.</p>
<p>He sighed deeply, thought deeply, and felt the emptiness of life, and felt a terrifying sorrow. His painful old age would decay in loneliness, dying in solitary desolation! He couldn't see any of his five sons. Tears welled up, seemingly regretting that he didn't die this time. This time, he still had two sons to send him off to his death! He would see it even more in the future...</p>
<p>The three sons in Nanyang, because the store went bankrupt, didn't send money, and even lost contact. The fifth son escaped after a disaster and wandered abroad. Their mother burst into tears whenever she thought of them. The third son's teacher also said he couldn't be relied on. The village was uneasy, banditry was pressing in, and rent couldn't be collected from the fields, and selling them was impossible. The whole family was women and children, how could they survive! Moreover, people came to demand debts, saying they would arrest people in the opposite house. It had changed so quickly in just two or three years, it felt like a dream! The old man felt pain and strangeness. He didn't know what to do. He seemed to have fallen into a terrifying deserted valley, a deep abyss. This was nothing like the gentle, peaceful home of a few years ago! He was trapped in all sorts of terrible thoughts, and all his withered muscles were trembling.</p>
<p>He was entangled in a coma from a serious illness for more than a month, making his daughters-in-law and daughters complain. The eldest daughter, who was relatively wealthy and whose husband's family had moved to the city, said in the old man's delirium: "Father has no hope, better to withdraw the blessings sooner, so as not to exhaust the children..." This clearly meant that they hoped their father, who was useless and exhausting them, would die sooner. The old man overheard this. How could people's hearts be so bad, in this world, even children are like this...</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the midst of near death, he saw his long-separated third and fifth sons. Their return made their father feel a little better, his mother said. However, after only ten days or so, the father's pain became dangerous, but the countryside was already in turmoil, many villagers had fled from the banditry, and at night they listened in terror to the... the terrifying, ear-piercing cries of the villagers. And finally, while the father was in a coma, the two sons left, abandoning their critically ill father!</p>
<p>The old man's forehead, full of wrinkles, felt like someone was stabbing it with a knife. His head hung down, and in a tearful voice, he asked the little daughter beside him: "Are the bandits better now?... Did your brothers say anything when they left..."</p>
<p>"The bandits came to Xiapu again last night, and even captured people..."</p>
<p>"Help me into the house..." The old man's unbearable sorrow was so painful that he couldn't support himself...</p>

<p>— Qin</p>
<p>My old friend Huang Suqiu, a wild talent from Yun, excels in calligraphy and painting, surpassing ordinary people. Once he puts his pen to paper, he has no regard for others. However, he is full of complaints and laments, and never likes to scold people with words. He often says that scolding oneself is self-respect, and scolding others is not only self-deprecating, but people will also laugh at me for being narrow-minded. I remember that in the early years of the Republic of China, he inscribed on a painting imitating Mei Hua'an Daoren (Taoist of the Plum Blossom Hermitage), "Some praise me for being a triple excellence, but I call myself having four excellences: talented but unrecognized, living off an empty mountain, no way to appeal, and wife and children worried. This is called 'absolute door, absolute road,' revealing all the secrets of heaven, wearing out the iron inkstone, the mountain spirit angered, the demons rejoiced, taking away his lifespan, overturning his ancestral temple. This is called 'absolute descendants.' But if there was a Mei Hua'an in the previous life, I would definitely follow the Taoist." He inscribed on a painting imitating Shi Tao, "Poetry, calligraphy, and painting all imitate Shi Tao. The courtyard is desolate and lonely like a monk, the brushstrokes are bleak, the connoisseurs are few, the orphaned life is the same as that of the blind Venerable." He also wrote a couplet for himself, "Raise your head to peek beyond heaven and earth, lose your footing and fall into the world of poetry and books." At that time, he was indulging in drinking and wildness in his hometown, full of depression, occasionally venting in inscriptions, but never uttering a word to defame anyone. After the Gengshen year (1920), he made a living painting in Shanghai, and became even more secretive and self-critical, his wild demeanor completely restrained. (Que Chou)</p>

<p>Yue Feng's "Dr. Wife," originally scheduled to start filming on the 15th, Yue has given up this plan due to certain relations and has compiled a script with new subject matter and stimulation.</p>
<p>In "Hero of the Times" there is a miscellaneous play in the flour exchange, in which several people posing as brokers are specially invited by director Ying Yunwei from his broker friends in the city's flour exchange, so the results of this scene were filmed extremely well.</p>
<p>Ying Yunwei told people that the script for "Hero of the Times" began to be written during the production of "Peach and Plum Tribulation," costing several times more effort than "Peach and Plum Tribulation."</p>
<p>In "Triumphant Song" there is a Dragon King Temple, where more than a hundred large and small Buddha statues in the temple are carved by many craftsmen specially hired by Yihua to sculpt statues. Twenty-five large Buddha statues, twelve medium Buddha statues, and thirty-nine small Buddha statues have now been completed. The largest Four Seas Dragon King statues will begin to be carved in the next few days. These craftsmen specializing in making statues said that before carving, they must first wash their hands and burn incense, otherwise they will inevitably suffer from headaches and fever. Who knew that the Buddha statues used in "Triumphant Song" were used to remove superstitions.</p>
