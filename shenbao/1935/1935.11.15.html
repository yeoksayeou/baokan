<h3 id="c15">菲列賓半獨立以後 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>菲列賓民族。自脫離西班牙之統治後。處於美國國旗之下者。垂三十七年。雖美國在菲之各種建設。爲世人所羨稱。然本民族自决之原則。菲島志士要求獨立。努力於脫離異族統治者。數十年如一日。今美國已允許菲島於十年以後完全獨立。十年以內。則爲半獨立狀態。半獨立之菲列賓政府。於今日在馬尼拉成立。美國政府以此爲美國遠東關係史中最重要一頁。亦民主黨執政後之最重要工作之一。總統以陸軍部長爲代表。國會以上下院之議長爲代表。遠道東來。參加其典禮。吾人與美國爲故友。與菲島爲比鄰。對於菲列賓民族獲得自治及美國政府之實踐前諾。深致慶賀及欽佩之意。</p>
<p>然吾人不能已於言者。美國之實踐前諾。果絕對誠懇否耶？菲列賓之獲得自治。果絕對可慶賀否耶？按美國於美西戰爭期中。佔領菲列賓。其動機有二政。治的動機。以菲列賓爲美國遠東根據地。所以提高美國在太平洋及中國問題上之發言權也。經濟的動。機一則利用菲島之原料及市塲。爲美國工商界圖利。再則以馬尼拉爲媒介。增進對中國之貿易。如英國之有香港也。然三十年來。在政治上言。則菲列賓爲美國之重負。其地距美國遼遠。接近日本。防守不易。隨時有落入日本掌握之危。故軍事家認菲島爲美國國防上最大弱點所在。在經濟上言。菲島之原料。如糖如椰子油。與美國國內糖業油業直接衝突。菲島之移民。更使美國太平洋岸人民因懼而生怒。蓋菲民入美。不受限制。則其賤工資可以奪美國人民之工作。而降低勞動階級之生活標準也。此次美國允許菲列賓半獨立。大半因糖業油業資本家及太平洋岸工人團體之堅持。如謂其動機絕對利他。則未可輕然置信也。</p>
<p>菲島半獨立以後美。國對於其國防問題。仍舊負責。參謀總長麥克亞述將軍。已辭職東來。爲菲政府籌防務計畫。然菲列賓政治家所遇之問題。千頭萬緒。其解决之困難。雖有十倍於今日菲島之財力人力。及武力尙無左券之可操。對內而言。爲種族宗敎之複雜。經濟上階級之對立而尤可危者。十年以內。美國將漸漸抬高對菲之關稅。使菲人藉以爲生之糖業。椰子油業無市塲而沒落。蓋過去美菲間自由貿易已漸見糖油二業之衰落。况自由貿易之廢除。美國市塲之封閉乎？因經濟之困難。易招內部之革命。對外方面。日本之侵略。骎骎可畏。目前日本受菲島關稅之限制。其對菲棉織物之輸入。已能駕於美國之上。菲島產業幼稚。何能抵抗此種高度之經濟壓力。前月美日二國曾有紳士協定之訂立。限制日本對菲之輸出。及菲政府對日貨進口稅之增加。然此種紳士恊定。成效至微。不足以解菲島經濟上內憂外患也。防務方面。以菲島每年五千四百萬菲洋之收入。充行政費已感不足。何能佈置國防。日本久認菲島爲日帝國之一部份。臥榻之前。不容他人酣睡。其思染指。亦意計中事。是故半獨立後之菲列賓。其所引起之遠東局面如何。實未許吾人樂觀也。</p>

<p>各黨觀察專家皆謂、舉國一致政府必可獲選、惟目前所佔四百零四席之多數必將大减云、</p>
<p>自上屆總選舉後、選民已增一百五十萬人、此輩之政治意見、殊難窺測、投票人女性超過男性一百七十五萬人、預料鄉選區二百二十五處、計二百三十二席、其結果今夜可揭曉、其餘各地、除數處外、明夜可知其結果、英國無綫電播音公司將自今夜十時起、至明晨四時止、隨時播吿所收到之結果、</p>
<p>各黨皆料政府將在二百二十五鄉選區遭最大之損失、上屆國會此二百三十二席政府黨佔一百九十七席、反對黨佔三十五席、一九二九年國會保守黨佔七十七席、工黨佔一百三十八席、自由黨佔十四席、超然派佔三席、</p>

<p>（倫敦）明日爲英國下院舉行總選舉之期、此爲四年來所未有之英國各政黨大决戰、依照英國選舉法、無論男女、年滿二十一歲者、均有選舉權、因此預測投稟人數當在二千五百萬以上、查英國本屆下議院係一九三一年十月二十七日所選出、其各黨議席分配如下、</p>
<p>（一）政府黨</p>
<p>保守黨　四七一</p>
<p>國民自由黨　六八</p>
<p>國民工黨　一三</p>
<p>超然派　二</p>
<p>（二）反對黨</p>
<p>工黨　五二</p>
<p>自由黨　四</p>

<p>合計　六一五</p>
<p>就上表觀之、國民內閣在下院中、佔有五百五十四席之絕大多數、故能執政至四載之久、內閣基礎亳不動搖、但就最近數年來之補缺選舉及市參事會選舉觀之、反對黨之工黨輒獲勝利、國民政府已不能再如四年前之獲大多數擁護、此實由於內政失敗之所致、因此本屆總選舉、工黨或有捲十重來之望、保守黨方面樂觀人士、預測工黨僅能獲得一百七十五席、卽較上屆選舉多得一百二十餘席、如此則政府黨仍可保持絕對多數、然據工黨上議員史脫波奇勛爵之推測、則工黨可獲三四十席之多數、卽所得議席常在三百三十席以上云、大槪下列之佔計、當最有可能、卽工黨所得議席、在二百席至二百三十席之間、反對黨超然派得十席、薩繆爾派自由黨得十席至二十席、政府黨得三百五十席至四百席、卽仍佔一百席至一百六十席之多數、惟英國選舉、不參加投票之選民、爲數甚多、其中選民一百五十萬人、在競選時期、不易明瞭其態度、故結果如何、殊難逆覩也、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國下議院於本日舉行總選舉、投票最後結果、將視自由黨之票數以定之、查自由黨共分兩派、一爲內務大臣西門所領導之一派、係屬政府派、一爲薩繆爾派、則係反政府派、兩派總計提出候選議員二百十一人、其中西門派四十一人、薩繆爾派一百七十八人、凡由西門派自由黨提出候選之各選舉區、政府黨與反對派之工黨、雙方對壘、甚爲顯明、但薩繆爾派自由黨提出候選之區域、則造成三角鬥爭之形勢、薩繆爾派大槪僅能獲得議自數席但因反對派票數分散轉足使政府黨獲得利益、至於自由黨未提出候選員之選舉區、則自由黨勸令各選民投票選舉、接受「和平與經濟建設綱領」之各候選議員、保守黨候選議員中接受該綱領者不過二十人、工黨候選議員　受該綱領者、亦不過三分之一、職是之故、在自由黨未提出候選議員之大多數選舉區內、一般自由黨選民、勢將無所適從、此等選民票數、佔計約近一百五十萬票、其投票態度若何殊成疑問、因此選舉結果若何、殊難預測、據各方推測、保守黨仍將獲得大多數、但或將較原有議席、减少一百席、苟然、則國民內閣能否繼續存在、當視西門派自由黨及保守黨「死硬派」（卽邱吉爾所領導右派保守黨）之態度以定、倘西門派自由黨與右派保守黨、脫離政府黨、則內閣卽無法支持、西門派自由黨主張自由貿易、而右派保守黨則主張極端保護關稅、及帝國孤立政策、二者極端相反彼時政府周旋於其間、其道必甚難矣、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）各黨競選已趨白熱化、候選人一千三百人今日各逞辯才、爲最後之演說、工黨於一九二四年後每遇選舉輒存戒心、深懼再有類似齊維諾夫之函伴出現、致遭第一屆工黨內閣傾覆之命運、但彼等之過慮至今尙未成爲事實、工黨候選人擬迫政府發言人說明鮑爾溫國防費、未有成效、蓋以政府候選人拒絕討論此項問題也、（十三日國民電）</p>

<p>（十一月四日六日對全國民衆講）</p>
<p>— 中央人教授　煥庸</p>
<p>（一）　本講的題目，是「風雨雷電霜雹雪等怎樣發生，」要在極短的時間裏，夾講這樣一個複雜的題目；並不是一件容易的事，現在勉强分爲兩次夾講，今天先講風雨雷電怎樣發生。</p>
<p>什麼呌風？風是空氣的一種流動，地球面上有一層相當厚度的空氣包圍着，我們在平常的時候，對於空氣視之無色，嗅之無味，有時幾不覺其存在，但是當他流動的時候，有時却能發出呼呼之聲，我們如能承認風的存在那就不能不承認空氣的存在了。</p>
<p>當炎夏的時候，我們需要的是習習凉風，當冬季時，我們畏懼的是凜冽北風，風究竟如何發生的，他的性質，何以又有這樣的不同。</p>
<p>我們看見水是常流動的，他流動的方向，楚由高處流向低處·所謂水性就下，水本無就下之性，不過因爲受了地球的吸力，遂不得不由高處流向低處，流到平了才止·換一句話說，水的流動，也是出於水的壓力，高處的水，他向下的壓力大，低處的水，他向下的壓力小，壓力大的，勝過壓力小的，高處的水，就不得不向低處來了，不過這水的壓力，仍就是受了地心吸力的吸力，才產生的。</p>
<p>空氣的質地，雖然稀薄，但是也受地球的吸力，因此也有向下的壓力，這就是我們所說的氣壓，空氣的流動，同水的流動一樣，也是從壓力大的地方，流向壓力小的地方。平常在氣象台出版的天氣圖上，以及報紙上登載氣象台所發表的天氣預吿裏，常有所謂「高氣壓」與「低氣壓各種名稱，高氣壓就是空氣壓力較高之處，低氣壓就是空氣壓力蛟低之處，高氣壓的地方，風多向外流，低氣壓的地方，風多向內流。我們人生活在空氣下層，等於深海裏的魚，生活在海底裏一樣。我們雖不能看到空氣層的高低厚薄，但是我們從氣壓的高低，却能看出氣流或是風的方向。</p>
<p>平常氣象台或測候所對於風的觀測，一種看他的來向，一種看他的速力，空氣流動的方向，大多是從氣壓高的地方流到氣壓低的地方，通常論風向，或用東南西北四方，或再加上東南，西南，東北，西北成爲八方，或者再精密些有十六方，甚至三十二方之分。至於風力的大小，就看氣壓高低的差別，兩地氣壓差別大的，風力就大，差小的，風力就小。至於風的冷熱，乃是因他的來源不同，從熱的地方來就熱，從冷的地方來就冷，譬如我們冬天的風，冬半從北方吹來，北方天氣冷，所以風也就是冷的。</p>
<p>空氣裏面，常常含有水汽，這水汽的來源，大多是從海面河面乃至潮濕的陸地面上蒸發上去的，水汽同空氣一樣，平常也是看不出來的，水汽冷了，重新凝成水滴，水滴小的，受空氣的浮托，仍舊留在空中，這就是我們所說的霧和雲，低的呌霧，高的呌雲，這都是空氣中的細小水滴，水滴大了，空氣浮托不住，就要掉下來，這就是我們所說的雨。所以雨，就是水汽上升以後，受着冷，凝結了大的水滴，因此掉下來的。</p>
<p>至於雷和電，原是一種現象，我們聽到的聲呌雷，我們看到的光呌電，這都是電的一種變化，空中的水汽，尤其是雲，是能發生幷負帶着多量的電的，空氣是比較不易傳電的物質，天空的電要跑到地上來，或甲雲上的電，要跑到乙雲上去，同時遇着空氣的阻力，就能發出光與聲來，不過聲音走的慢光綫走的快，所以我們常是先看到電，後聽到雷。當夏天暴雨的時候，空中電性甚强，有時能在樹木房屋乃至人體上，假道而過，於是就發生雷擊的現象，現在凡有高的建築，多要裝起避雷針，用金屬綫道引電流，免他從建築物上經過，因爲金屬是比建築物容易傳電，電由金屬綫上走，建築物就可免除雷擊，甚至被破壞了。雷電是一種極普通的自然現象，絕非如一般人所想，以爲冥冥之中，有神在主宰着他。</p>
<p>以上略舉風雨雷電發生的原因，關於露霜雹雪如何發生，尙待下次再講。</p>
<p>（二）　今天是接着上次，講露霜雹雪等怎樣發生，上次講過地面或海面的水受着熱，蒸發爲氣，留在空中，就呌水汽，水汽冷了，軍新凝結爲水滴，小的浮在空中，就是雲，比較大的浮近地面，那就是霧，要是水滴過大，空氣浮托不住，直接掉了下來，那就是雨。</p>
<p>水汽在空中的變化，還不止是這雲霧和雨三種，當着夏天的晚上太陽下山以後，地面　溫度，慢慢的低降，空氣的溫度，在瞬間常比地面要略略高些，空氣中的水汽，　　　　還不過低，沒有達到凝結的時候，但是地面是够凉的，空氣中的水汽，遇着地面或草木植物之面，就能結成水滴，這就呌露。露同霧原可說是一樣的東西，不過一個凝結在地面之　，一個凝　在空氣之中，兩者不能同時存在，有了霧，就舞露，有了露，就無霧，大霧的天氣，地面受空氣中霧滴的潤濕，也能變爲潮潤，不過道不是露。凡遇有雲的天氣，雲能阻止地面散熱，溫度降低不易，那就不能成露，當大風時，露亦不易構成。</p>
<p>霜與露原爲一樣的東西，古人說，「露結爲霜」，霜並不由露所結成，不過水汽在地面凝結的時候，溫度如在氷點以上，就成露，如在氷點以下，就是霜，這完全是由於溫度高低的不同，並非水汽　凝爲露，再結爲霜，露多成於夏秋之際，霜則成於冬春之交，凡成霜之夕，溫度必曾降達氷點以下，嬌嫩的植物，受不了寒霜的侵襲，所以一交霜降，就不免落葉枯黃了。</p>
<p>雪之與雨，好像霜之與露，水汽在高空地方，溫度低降而在氷點之上，就成雲成雨，假如溫度低降而在氷點之下，水汽就要凝結成雪。雪是由水汽直接凝成的，並非由於水滴或雨滴構成的，有時水汽凝為織小的冰針：亦能停留空中，如普通所見之卷雲即是。</p>
<p>雪多降於冬季，而雹則多降於夏李，雪係微小之花，雹係塊狀之冰，雪多降於冬李寒冷之時，因其時溫度低下，足以消滅地面害蟲，故人多稱曰端雪，雹多降於炎夏作物生長之時，每値降雹，常致成災，雪與雹之性質旣如此其差異，故其發生之情形，亦大有不同，雪花係由水汽直接所凝成，而雹則係雪花雨滴所混合之冰塊。當夏李時，地面溫度炎熱，空氣上升，對流作用甚盛，更可發生旋風，氣流時升時降，無有一定，當此之時，氣流內所含水汽，冷或凝爲雪，下降或化爲水，上升復結爲冰，如此升降無定，雹塊重重增大，最後乃降達地面，小則如豌荳，大者如鷄卵，甚或有更大者，雹塊降落於地，不特田中牲畜，有　擊　者，而禾毅紅共打擊，因而斷折夭亡　，又將小知凡幾，所降雹之區未必過廣，降雹之機，亦甚稀少，因此爲害亦較淺耳。</p>
<p>以上所舉露霜雹雪以及雲霧雨澤等，無非爲水汽所變成，水因蒸發而成爲水汽，停積於空中、水汽因溫度低降，乃凝結爲雲霧露霜雹雪雨等，就中除浮雲外，均復降於地，或爲甘露，或爲嚴霜，或爲瑞雪，或爲災雹，而雨之下降，亦有甘霖與　水之別，其對於人生之影響，利害各不相同，要皆水汽所生之變化而已。地面上如無空氣，如無此水汽之變化，則一切生物，亦將不能存在，我們所稱爲氣象學的，就是專門研究這些大氣中，一切風雲雨雷等等變化的。我們如要知道何時要有暴風，何時要有驟雨，乃至何時有霜，何時有雹，用來保　航空航海以及農林殺物的安全，必須各地廣設氣象台或測候所，根據精密的記錄，來作正確的預吿，如此方得無誤。（完）</p>

<p>— 鄔翰芳</p>
<p>威爾遜總統當他離任的時候，寫一封信給議會裏，說道：「允許我請你們的注意，就是菲律賓人自主的政治，差不多已經成功。爲他們利益起見，和我們以前所允許他們的，都應該由理想變爲事實。」‘</p>
<p>（六）特別委員會調查菲島的報吿哈定總統在一九二一年三月四日，就任大總統後，他任命一個特別委員會，前總督任德和喀麥隆君一起派到菲島去。爲的是調查研究一切情形，然後做一個報吿給美政府，美政府就以此爲根據，定出一種政策來，要求美人的承認和贊助。這個特別委員團，費了四個月的工夫，走遍菲律賓的島嶼，並和菲島的羣衆，多多接觸。</p>
<p>這個特別委員會的報吿，已經公布出來。內容大致是美總統的意見，和對於特別委員會的訓條。還有菲律賓的略史與菲人的生活狀况。這個報吿較重要的部分，就是菲島現狀的分析，現在就與獨立運動有關係的，舉出幾段如下：</p>
<p>我們覺得菲島的人民，是快樂的，和平的，很重視美國治理的利益的。</p>
<p>我們覺得菲島無論那一部分，信耶敎的菲人，都希望獨立，普通人在美國保護之下，非基督敎徒與美國人，都希望美國繼續治理下去。</p>
<p>我們覺得如果獨立後，依然在他國保護之下，不算是眞正的獨立。</p>
<p>我們覺得由過去八年來的經騐，菲人幾乎已有實際上的自治政府。美國如果放棄政治上的保護權，退出海陸軍，把這個島國，隨便讓給列强來管理，却希圖肥饒土地與未來商業上種種利益，那就可以說是不公正的。總起來說，我們如果退出菲島，和他們終止關係，沒有給菲人一個很好的機會，使他們能　成立一個有秩序的永久的自治政府，那麽對菲人爲不信，對美人爲不幸，阻塞菲人進步之路，使向後退，如此忽略美國應盡的義務，不是一伴很恥辱收事麽？</p>
<p>我們提議美國要維持菲律賓的現，直到他們有完全自主權爲止。</p>
<p>我們提議美國有責任的代表菲總督，他所有的權力，應和他的地位一致。</p>
<p>我們提議在菲總督與菲上議院之間，關於任命問題發生，不能解决時，美總統有贊否與决定之權。</p>
<p>我們提議美政府在某島建設各種事業、不願意居負責地位、而沒有實際上的權力。</p>
<p>（七）美國遲遲給與菲島獨立之原因菲島獨立運動，一時未許實現的原因，總爲實利的衝突。再加分析，有下列幾個理由：</p>
<p>第一國防上的原因　太平洋未來風雲，日見險惡。日本自然是美國的眼中釘。其餘荷蘭之有東印度諸島，法之有印度支那，英之有香港，新加坡與馬來半島，在軍事上與商業上，均確有深原的基礎。美國若沒有一個菲律賓，做他海軍的根據地，那末在遠東不能維持均勢的局面，美國在遠東盛大的商業，着實有些危險。英國駐香港的海軍提督，曾經說道：「如果美國的國旗，在馬尼拉卸下去，英國的國旗，就替他升起來。」美國人也常常說道：「如果美國人早上在菲律賓退出去，日本人晚上就要進來了。」此以美國對列强之環視菲律賓，很有戒心。這就是美國因國防上不肯輕易放棄菲島而快快與菲島以獨立的原因。</p>
<p>第二經濟上的原因　自從一九〇九年以來，美菲間早已實行自由貿易。美國以宗主國的關係，每年以一萬萬元之貿易額到菲，若按白分之二十抽關稅，就可省去二千萬元了。又每一年菲自美運來二十萬出產英畝出产的麥，十萬畝出產的棉花，三一五〇畝果子園產出的蘋果，値一百餘萬元的汽車。如果菲島成了、一個獨立國，那末兩國都要失去自由貿易的利益。別的國家，以低廉的工價，賣運菲島的烟，糖，蔴，椰子油到美國的市塲裏去，當然可　勝算。美國的產物，運到菲島來，自然也有許多障礙。而且菲欠美債爲總數七千萬金元，美在菲所投資本，亦有二千萬元。他們以為一旦離開菲島，難免要受一萬萬元的損失。所以由經濟方面看來，美國也一時不輕易許菲島以獨立的。</p>
<p>（八）獨立運動之成功菲律賓自從一九〇七年運動發端以來，他們繼續不斷的奮鬭。近年來菲人受民族自决主義的影響，又加以國民愛國心，如此的熱烈，對獨立運動，已達白熟化。獨立運動領袖如現總統奎松氏和參議院議員奧斯米拿氏，最爲熱忱。先後赴美，用和平的方法，誠懇的態度，向美國當局和人民，作强有力的請求。實際上美國治菲三十餘年來的成續，已昭然在世界人的耳目中。他雖然也離不了一個帝國主義者，但他所取的政策，是寬大的，並無領土的野心，很有誘掖提携弱小民族的風度，這是歐洲大陸各國自私自利的殖民政策所望　莫及的。平心而論，美人治菲以來，對菲人之管理，極爲自由，從不若荷屬英屬對待殖民地之苛刻。幷且美人駐菲行政人員，用逐年遞减法，作者於五年前旅菲參觀其政府之各種機關，美國之官吏，幾等於零，其對菲之態度，可見一斑。美國給與菲島的獨立，原是時問問題，不過菲人在內力未充的時候，美國以國防問題和經濟上的原因，也自不好卽時放棄。本年美國參衆兩議院均已通過菲島之獨立案，許其卽時成立自治政府，美國負十年之責，維持菲島之獨立。其所以有這樣美滿之解决，爲的是美菲間自由貿易和通商的，種種互惠條件依然存在，對經濟已不成問題。美國之海陸空軍依然留駐菲島，表面上是說應付太平洋上的風雲，實際上對菲還是以保護人自居。幷且美人對菲給與獨立的諾言，也不好屢屢口惠而實不至，所以菲律賓人三十餘年的獨立運動，至今可說完全成功了。</p>
<p>菲律賓自治政府是已經產生了，第一任大總統奎松氏，也已舉出來了。本年十一月十五日，舉行菲新政府正式成立慶祝盛典。美國特派美副總統迦納氏和陸軍總長寶恩氏等等等要人參加，此舉實足以表示美菲兩國人民與政府間之友誼。然另一方面，此次邀請實有深長的用意，菲律賓政府與人民希望彼輩與新政府改革菲律賓事務之行政立法人員相識，並得以明瞭新政府人員在遠東與該島上之行政，其結果且可使新政府人員以後對於立法上得有便利。由此可看見美菲兩國間之合作與友誼仍然繼續存在。</p>
<p>菲律賓人已高高堅起獨立的旗幟，在亞洲樹立一個嶄新的獨立和國家了。其在國際上的地位，將以中日菲之獨立國同時並舉。奔且中菲的關係，尤其密切。我們有二十餘萬的華僑，留駐菲土，在經濟上向握有牛耳的地位。幷且中菲以久年歷史上的關係，互通婚嫁，種族極爲接近。我國從此來慶祝菲島獨立運動之成功和中菲未來之眞正親善與共存共榮。</p>

<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>（二十四年十一月於上海）</p>
<p>—謹獻於中國國民黨第五次全國代表大會諸同志和好談政制改革的先生們—</p>
<p>第四，國難的召致，就算都是國民黨掌握政權的緣故，也不能因此就讓「黨治」和一訓政」天負罪魁禍首的責任。因爲，就實在情形講，過去的數年之中、强鄰虎視、外患日烈，若匪禍狓猖，內憂孔亟，如果認為是國民黨的失敗，則與其說是『黨治」的失敗，毋庸說是一黨而不治」的失敗，與其說是「訓政」失敗，毋寗說是「政而不訓」的失敗。故憑我個人的愚見，要救亡圖存，挽回國家的厄運，如果專去費心勞力於紙而上成文憲法的議訂和預布，反不如開誠布公，埋頭苦幹，從團結果黨的內部，實行黨的政綱入手，以收黨治一的實效，從籌備地方自治，培養人民能力入手，以達「訓政」的目的。如果國民黨的中委，始終能像四屆六中全會一　地表現着團結結精神，大家在一起來苦幹，　民沒有不擁護的；如果國民黨對於充實國力和培養民力的政策，能件件像改革幣制案一蘇地表示着縣斷的力量，人民也沒有不樂從的；如果國民黨的各級黨部確能協助各級政府，爲民服務，於最短期間，遍設學校，開通民智，復興農村，振濟災荒，使多數人民的智力財力都增加起來，人民也沒有不願意接受，而地方自治也沒有不會完成的。各地方的人民都能自治，而又能擁護中央，樂從政府的政策，則全國上下，一心一德，救亡圖存的目的自然可以達到。可見目前國難的解除，只須當軸的國民黨能够奮發努力，便可做到，不必對着國難，怨天尤人，更不必隨波逐流，喪失了自信力，也來一窩蜂地自己責備那一黨治「訓政」的不合。</p>
<p>以上，我已經把那些反對三民主義者所標榜的政制改革論的理論根據，逐層指出牠的謬誤所在了。讀者至此，或以爲我是不主張政制改革的，其實則又不然。我雖不相信政制是萬能，只要政制一改革，國事便可起死回生；但我也以爲政制是經騐的產物，增加一分經騐便應該改善一分政制，以求「止於至善」，而况「窮則變，變則通」的哲理，在政制上也有時可以運用，則爲適應目前的環境計，尋求現行政制的缺點，而更謀其改善，自然也當爲我們所贊同。不過我以爲改革目前的政制，應記住兩大原則，不能不先作一番說明：（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c172">玻璃工業參觀記 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 婁立齋</p>
<p>—中央化學玻璃廠—</p>
<p>遜淸乾隆年間，中央政府曾投資數十萬元，在山東博山設立玻璃廠，聘英籍技師，製造玻璃用具；這是我國玻璃工業的嚆矢，不過該廠出品，祗有有閒的人們所用的鼻烟壺和建築上所用的瓦形天窗玻璃，未能適應大衆的需要，以至營業失敗，虧本停歇，那時，被解職的工人　爲生活所迫，便本其技術，和經騐，多在家裏製造一些玻璃用具，可是他們智力薄弱，又沒相當資本，對於製造的設備和技術，祗能默守成法，莫由改進，所以到現在他們的子孫，還祇能做一些文鎭等料器罷了。</p>
<p>近年以來，玻璃工業和其他工業相同，也有相當的進展，天津·北平·上海·廣州·福州·長沙·宿遷·唐山·等處，都有玻璃工廠，在數量上看來，不可算少，不過出品可和外貨相競爭的，還不多見，而能生產化學上和光學上應用的玻璃的，更是寥若晨星，上海的中央化學玻璃廠，是專製化學玻璃的，該廠所產各種玻璃器皿，大部份是供給化學及醫療上用的，該廠雖開辦未久，規模不大，但出品業經上海工業試騐所證明，認爲品質優良，堪供科學試騐之用。</p>
<p>十月十六日下午，我們一行三人，乘了本館的汽車，由館處發，經提籃橋，入平凉路，駛抵寗國路口，在該廠門前下車，經通報之後，即由經理徐新之先生，及廠長王正曦先生迎入，他們都穿着很僕素的衣服，尤其是王先生，穿了一身很骯　髒的靑布衫褲，我們看了這很骯髒的衣服，便可想到王先生指揮着工人埋頭苦幹的情形。</p>
<p>兩位先生很股勤地招待我們，在略事寒喧之後，就領導我們到各個部份去參觀。</p>
<p>玻璃工廠和普通通廠不同，就是各種出品，都須從爐灶內出貨，而爐灶內的原料，則須先由工程師，把各種原料，配合攪和，分別裝在坩堝裏，在十小時以前，送入爐灶內燃燒的，所以他們首先領導我們到原料間去參觀。</p>
<p>玻璃的重要原料料石英粉和螢石粉，原料間裏，除分別堆着很多的這種東西，堆着巳經配合好的原料，是預備送入爐灶裏去燃燒的。</p>
<p>我們走出了原料間，就到爐灶間，看見有許多工人，圍着血紅的燼灶，在做不同的工作，有一部份人把空心的鐵桿，從坩堝中取了一些燒得血紅玻璃料，吹了一吹，再擺了幾擺，就放在一個鐵製的模型裏吹着，渦了一會兒，再取出來，便形成了一件器皿，有一部份人，在做高脚的酒杯和各種熱水杯，還有一部份人在拉玻璃管，拉得很長很長後，再依照着須要的長短切斷，在爐灶間的後面，有大烘房三間，是專供製就的器皿退熱用的，因爲把初從爈灶裏取出的原料製成的器皿，溫度很高，一定要使它慢慢兒地退去，所以有一部份工人，在把初製就的器皿，送入烘房裏去，一切製成的器皿，在烘房裏過了二十四小時，便可拿出來，在施其他的工作。</p>
<p>我們看完了爐灶間的情形，徐王兩位先生再領導我們到刻花間去，我們在那裏看見排着許多機器，也有許多工人，圍着機器做各種不同的工作，有的在刻很精細的花紋於玻璃杯上，有的在磨光玻璃杯的口。</p>
<p>再次我們又到量器刻度間去，看見有二三個工人，在機器上刻十西西的量筒，和一西西分刻一百度的滴管，這種工作，是很精細的，量器刻度間的隔壁，便是煤氣工塲，那盡裏有許多工人在做冷凝管和量瓶的口，據徐王兩先生吿訴我們，這種工藝是很不容易做的，所以這一部份的工人，待遇很高，最大的工資，每月達一百八十元，比諸經理和廠長的待遇高得多。</p>
<p>最後，兩位先生還領我們到包裝間去看包裝的情形。</p>
<p>我們看完了生產的過程，又承徐先生吿訴我們，該廠是幾個愛好科學的人發起紙織的，民國二十二年九月開始籌傭，二十三年七月成立，資本五萬元，營業的對象是學術界和醫學界，家庭用具，則並不十分重視，自開辦以至去年年底，半年內營業額達十餘萬元，本年以來，營業很有進展，全國各大學之採用該廠出品的，巳達十分之七。</p>
<p>我們聽了這一翻話，深覺在這國人極力提倡科學的今日，國人能自製科學器皿，來促進中國的科學，不可謂非中國之幸，願科學界能多多採用，以發展中國的科學。註：（中國徵信所主編「上海紡織業概况」尙有幾句話補充）按上海紛織印染公</p>
<p>司，自去冬停工以來，其間曾屢謀復業，前月初，得杜月笙等起而　織匯</p>
<p>業銀團，積極加以協助，巳於同月二十三日開工。</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Aloott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>後來醫生來了，那可憐的好漢，於是經過了一番苦鬥，因爲他脚上有些小骨頭受了傷，把這些弄好還是一痛苦的事。於是唐恩的口唇白了，粗珠子一般的汗停在他的額上，然而他從不叫喊出來，只是緊所致蜀夫人的手，所以過了許久時候還是紅着。</p>
<p>「你得要使這個童子十分安靜，至少要一星期，不使他放脚落地。到了那時，我可以知這他是否可以考一根杖一拐一跳，或者還得要再休息長久些，」大夫說着，隨手將閃耀的刀箝之類收拾起來，這些也正是唐恩所不愛看的呢。</p>
<p>唐恩聽到了拐杖的名詞，不免嚇了一跳，忙問道，「將來有一天可以好起來的，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「希望會好」：醫生說了這句話便辭去了，唐恩聽了，心裏殊爲懊喪，因爲損失了一隻脚，從一個活潑的童子看去，實是一件可怕的災難。</p>
<p>「不要担心，我是一個聞名的看護，我們要使你在一月以內行走如常」，蜀夫人說着，她對這事郤是採取樂觀的態度。</p>
<p>可是終身殘廢的恐懼，侵擾着唐恩的魂夢，便是坦第種種的溫慰也不足以振起他的精神；因此蜀夫人建議要一二個童子進去訪談一下，便問那幾個是他所喜歡見的。</p>
<p>「乃德和小橋；我也愛我的帽子，裏面有些東西我想他們也愛看的。我推想你丟去了我那個捕獲品的包？唐恩說道，到未了他發問的時候，臉上頓呈慌張之態。</p>

<p>— 方洵</p>
<p>九月初，東京的商業的劇塲都巳經開始了秋季的「合戰」，在這許多上演的目錄裏面，有吸引力一點是明治座上演的片岡鐵兵原作千田是也導演，水谷八重子主演的「新娘學校」，東京劇塲上演的眞船豐原作，久保田萬太郎導演的「鉈」，谷崎潤一郎原作，事多村綠郎導演的「春零抄」，和有樂座上演的菊池寬原作，水木久美雄導演的一袈裟的良人」，和小山內薰原作，園池欠功。靑柳信雄導演的「國性爺合戰」。明治座因爲其他的節目並無興味，東京劇塲的「春琴抄」本來很想一看，但是一則爲了看不慣「新派（日本的文明戲）」的那種男扮女的腔調，二則也不願在這種「高島出」和「桃割」（註：日本舊式髮髻名）的空氣中坐這麽五六個鐘頭，（新派的觀客大多是花柳界中人；和中國一樣的有名的演員出塲的時候，臺下怪聲喝采，所演劇本也限於所謂人情悲劇。）同時我想，谷崎的原作在這種塲合上演，早已經是「數鶯的嗚聲」「不得其時，不得其所」（原作主人公春琴語）所以祇去看了前歌舞伎名優壽美藏和夏川靜江等合演的（國性爺合戰」。</p>
<p>這劇本在這時候上演，我覺得是很有興味的事情。</p>
<p>故事的取材是在中國明末，「思宗寵臣李滔天私通韃靼，入寇中國，弒思宗於禁言，大司馬將軍吳三桂殺己子代替幼帝，得免於難，帝妹旃檀，得吳三桂妻柳歌君之助，乘船浮海，輾轉而至日本之平戶，先自明臣　芝龍爲奸佞所陷，速走日本，巳在平娶娶生子，子名和雜內（按即鄭成功），足智多謀，豪勇無敵，見旃檀來，知明　巳屋，芝麗乃率妻子回中國，謀見巳嫁將甘淸輝之長女錦祥，說甘輝助成功復明寅，甘輝亦有復國之志，但不願以妻子故，與「日人』和藤內合，錦祥乃剖腹明志而死，和藤內母爲絕其子後顧之慮，亦飲刃自害，和藤內乃率三軍，逐韃靼，復明室，以功封國性爺延平王。」</p>
<p>這故事並不是小山內的創作，在他之前已經在「凈瑠璃」及近松門左衛門的「歌舞伎」中有過相仿的結構，小山內的改作，大致以近松的歌舞伎爲藍本，就故事說，我們巳經覺得有點兒荒唐無稽，而想不到這位日本新劇運動創立者小山內先生Arrange的「改良歌舞伎」，，竟會混雜凌亂到這樣的程度。小山內氏的演出手法，本來是發源於史旦尼思洛思基的流派，但是平常那樣小心和仔細的他，在這兒竟冒了這麼大的危險！這戲除出日本原有的歌舞伎，義大夫之外，又採用了中國的音樂伴奏，中國戲的打武，Acrobat，據說還從梅蘭芳的中國劇中採取了手指和身段的表情方法，在舞臺裝置，也解說了小山內一流的舊寫實主義，而採用了極度簡單化的方式，打武的時候照樣的用跑龍套的翻筋斗，打虎跳，可是一回兒又來一曲南洋風的音曲，　戲劇，我感不到任何銘感，講Spectacle，也並不見得怎樣高明，那麽爲什麽要演這種戲呢？</p>
<p>我們現在且放開史實的是否眞實不管，第一照現在的那種演出，我們覺得除出醜惡化和　力化中國民族的力量，並沒有其他的意義劇中最同情和聖化的是和藤內的母親（日人），最英雄化的是穿着日本服的和藤內的本身例。例如竹林打虎那一塲（很明白這是脫胎於　陽　的），征服大虎的並不是和藤內的「人力」，而是他母親交給他的伊勢大神的「御守」（一種Ma　cot)的神力！再如在城樓一塲鄭芝龍換了明朝衣服，這目的也完全是爲着要在滿塲的「唐人」前面，從對照中發揚出和藤內之母的日本人的婦德和精神！</p>
<p>除出這些商業化的劇塲之外，Experimental的劇團的公演,例如「創作座」的九月公演，和「新協劇團」的一年紀念公演等等，大多是在　月下旬，但願這蝕削我肉體的失眠能够减輕一點，也許再可以將比較有生氣一點的東京劇訊報告給本刊的讀者吧。</p>

<h3 id="c225">關於新詩的路 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>最近在立報的「言林」上讀到了一篇作爲「蘧廬詩話」之一的陳子展先生的一篇關於新詩問題的文章。這篇文章的大意是：目前中國的新詩壇是頗爲不振的。「許多先進的新詩人都丟下了筆，無疑的都是承認自己失敗了。後進的新詩人也不曾找出什麽新路，還走老路，那是不智的；因此，陳先生就勸新詩人素性再去走「從舊詩詞蛻化出來的「胡適之體」這一條路，並且在中間還特別舉出了胡氏遊廣西時所作的一好像一首小詞」的「飛行小贊」來做所謂「胡適之體」的最新標本。</p>
<p>不錯，陳先生池曾聲明：「自然不是說這是唯一的路」；但至少這是「一條路」，而且是陳先生不惜特別指出的「新詩人可以走的一條路」，這是毫無疑義的了。</p>
<p>在目前，我覺得這種意見，是不太妥當，而値得加以討論的。</p>
<p>首先，得指出的，就是陳先生所說的話不免有點自相矛盾。他是深以後進新詩人不曾找出新路，還走老路爲不智的；但，同時，他又勸新詩人去走「胡適之體」這一條路。難道「胡適之體一就不算是一條「老路』嗎？難道走這條「老路」就算是「　」嗎？……</p>
<p>其次，就中國新詩運動史來說，誰都知道：作爲一個寫新詩的第一個嘗試者的胡適之的作品，因其時代及其才能的關係，可以說，都是些極其幼稚的，特別是跟舊詩詞有着不可分離的血統關係的產物。要是拿它們來跟後期作家的作品相比較，那是無論在內容或是形式方面，我們都無法否認：後來的新詩無疑地巳經逐漸進展到更高的階段了。不料此刻陳先生却反而呌現在的新詩人回過頭來，再去走胡適之的老路。我覺得，這不但一筆勾消了十幾年來慘淡經營的新詩運動所得的成果；而且，說得嚴重點，還不免有故意勸人開倒車之嫌呢！</p>
<p>記得胡適之富年在「嘗試集」四版的自序上，曾經把那些沒有中過舊詩詞的毒的「批新詩人比作「天足的女孩子們」，說他們的創作「大膽的解放，充滿着新鮮的意味，使我一頭高興，一頭又很慚愧」；而把自己却比作一個「纏過脚後來放大了的婦人」，坦直地承認自己的詩中」總還帶着纏脚時代的血腥氣」。他這種比喻如果還算是恰當的話，那陳子展先生正無異於呌我們這些「天足的女孩子們」重新再云學那「纏過脚後來放大了的婦人」走路，再在脚上滲出些「纏脚時代的血腥氣」來呢！</p>
<p>誠然，目前中國的新詩壇是相當不振的。其原因雖然也很不少，但寫詩的人的確也不能不負相當的責任。——文藝（詩自然也不會是個例外），是現實的反映。一篇作品越是能夠正確地，深刻地反映客觀現實，就越有意義和價値。可是，事實上，目前中國却有不少的。詩作者簡直不敢或是「不屑」把他們的「高貴」的眼睛正視現實，他們一天到晚仍然高據在至高無上的象牙之塔裏：或則專門吟風弄月，努力企圖在新瓶子裏裝上那已經發霉的陳酒，或則除照樣哼些花呀烏呀少女呀七弦琴呀之外，還自許爲什麼派什麽派，故弄其文字上的虛玄、故炫其所謂「新奇的手法」，寫出許許多多爲「低能的」讀者們所不懂的「美麗的」詩章來。這是一種現象。此外，還有一部分詩作者，雖然他們在某種程度上已經具有正確的世界觀和意識形態；但他們或則生活還欠充實，體騐還感不足，容易使作品失之空泛；或則還沒有把握到最適切的表現方法，不能把特定的主題「兌現」於具體的形象之中，因而難於寫出令人滿意的作品。這又是一種現象。—我們的詩人們的活動巳然是這麽一種情况，那又何怪目前新詩壇的不振呢！</p>
<p>所以，我覺得，對於中國今日的新詩人們，最重要的一點，還是勇敢地面對着現實，一壁盡量充實自己的生活，一壁不斷地在創作活動中去征取嶄新的技巧。只有這樣，才可以取得更大的成就，才能够替新詩展開那更來得坦蕩的前途！</p>
<p>至於「胡適之體」呢，我以爲那巳經是歷史上的「古董」，那决不是一條路，决不是我們的新詩人在目前所應當走的一條路。</p>
<h3 id="c226">人生與愛 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴以霖</p>
<p>作家Mary　Colenidge在題名The　King　Is　Dead，Long　Live　The　King　l文中，叙述一個意味深長的故事：從前有一個國王，在很年靑的時候死去了，他覺得那時還不是他應死的時候，並不是因爲他僅有美麗的妻，而因爲他生前是一個怎樣優良的國王，他成天成晚工作着，毫不自私地打算他的國里所有的人民的福利；此外他還有許多很好的友人。他自思無論他的妻，友人以及國里所有的人民，都在需要着他的復活。於是他終於得到上天的應允，許他重返世上，如能在一小時中，找出三個需要他復活的人，他便能在世間再活若干年紀。他回返到世間來，却全然失望了，甚至於他生前認爲至好的友人，把他的照片棄在地板上，把他的信札燒燬於爐火中，他的好友早去服侍新國王去了。他的美麗的妻，却正與情人幽會。一切全然出於「意表之外」，他才恍然悟出了自己的愚蠢，情願傷悲地睡在地下。</p>
<p>Mary　Colrridge在這篇文字里諷刺着世人自以爲自己的存在很重要的錯誤的心理。但我以爲這種心理上的錯誤是異常有益的。因爲有着這麽的一個錯誤橫在人心里，生活才有了深刻的意義。而且人類的進步也就基於這一點；不然大家放棄了「自己重視」的念頭，那麽整部的人類必將沉入垂死的暮氣中，變成一個自暴自棄的世界；也許有許多人因此將自己的生命與世吿辭。</p>
<p>一個人戚到自己被人或世間所需要的時候，這是人間最愉快的事；而且他立卽會感到深遠的生活意義。便是所謂「愛」，也就是感到被人所需要這麽一回事；——尤其是所謂「戀愛」。對於這邊有經騐的人，總該記得當他想起他是被一個女人愛着的事，胸間忽然浮起一種不可言喻的快威，而且引爲誇耀的。反之，人間最大的傷心，悲哀，便是發覺被拋棄：所以「失戀」以後，便發生自殺，也是屢見不鮮的事。</p>
<p>然而世人果眞不被其他人所需要麽？諸君自己一想就得。我想未必全像作家Maay　Coletidge所昭示那樣，師如世間有所謂「戀愛」一事，便可證明他的未必全然對。</p>
<p>可是，對於巳成了過去的人，被人忘却正是自然的法則。</p>

<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>有一次我碰到兩個快要畢業的師範學生，一個男的和一個女的，他們是一對戀人。在適當的塲合裏，我們談到辛福，將來的願望……那些東西，靑年男子是喜歡說話的，他用飽滿的宏朗的聲音說出他底理想來了。</p>
<p>「我們底訓育主任，又是一個奇怪的脚色。自己抽着大烟，開了一間運動器械文具店，和一間小飯店，整天忙得要死，却對學生：「我底理想是一個終身的革命。」——終身，多麽稀奇呀！……他喜歡對學生鞠躬，他敎訓人的時候，說：「密司脫王，請你這樣這樣，」或者「密司脫李，請你那樣那樣。」這傢伙扯謊。</p>
<p>「校長孔憲仁和訓育主任意見不同，他說：「一國底國民就像一窠裏的螞蟻。用顯微鏡放大起來樣子各有不同。我希望自己做一個誠實的服從的公民！……楊若鵬先生底勉勵是對的，我也是對的。——你們解剖過螞蟻沒有？」</p>
<p>「終身做別的事情，或者終身做公民，那結果怎樣呢？——他們都是錯的，我說。如果這蘇，我們想想十年以後的廣東吧，……至少有五百萬不認得字的野蠻孩子！一個沒有小學敎師的國家！每一個人都變成像——唉……</p>
<p>「我說我自己的吧。我要做一個省長。我第一件要做的事情是提高小學敎師底薪俸，規定高比率的加薪，給他們終身職業的尊榮地位，代他們保人壽，疾病，水火兵災險，宣佈他們在戲院，茶樓和各種公共交通事業裏的優待條例。……我做省長的月的是簡單的。此外，我想我能够沒收民間所有的槍械，用這法子避免兇險的事情。……我要像從前某某人那樣，只帶兩個跟班就能够在馬路上散步。人民看見我，不必在我底背後指點着悄悄說，『這就是省長，』他們可以走到我面前說，『你好呀，省長先生，』他們鞠躬不鞠躬可以隨便。……總之，我仍然過我底平民自由生活。……</p>
<p>「但是我和她好了起來以後，慢慢地就改變了。現在，我更固定地想我的確要做一個小學校長。一個小學校長。——容易明白的。她就是我底助手，『拍手伙計』。我們……你說什麽？」</p>
<p>那姑娘縮起頭來，撅起嘴唇，瞇着眼睛，用這種天的的姿勢做出鳴嗚的聲音之後，她更正地說：</p>
<p>「你不如老實吿訴他，這是我底理想吧！」</p>
<p>「好。——這是一樣的。我們只要求六十個學生。也不再請別的敎員。……這六十個孩子是我們底兒女，學生，也是我們底主人，我們大家同住在學校裏。……爲了他們身體的美和精神的美，要有廣大的校舍，包含運動塲，課堂，圖書館，宿舍，食堂，游泳池，　院，會堂……一個小山，一個小湖，一條小河……什麽地方都是花草和樹木。父母們把兒女托給我們兩個人，這是完全的信託。我們要他們穿起同樣的漂亮的衣服，不同的只是藍色的，棕色的，或黑色的眼睛。要他們從小就呼吸着文明。……你知道那些小孩子們會多麽喜歡退此東西！」</p>
<p>對於人民的憂慮，我承認他說出了很好的意見。正如他挑選了很好的妻子一樣。中國人民實在太需要美好的東西了。</p>

<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>我的第一篇雜文，投在自由談里的，呌做「故鄉的雨」，寫這一篇文章，距今巳經兩年多了，但我的情緒，彷彿還和兩年前一樣，一提起雨，終覺得牠宜於鄉村，不宜於都市，宜於春秋二季，不宜於冬夏，宜於黃昏，不宜於白天，不過這只就一般而論，倘在海濱，我到是喜歡夏天的暴雨的。</p>
<p>這是因爲愛憎也遼得隨環境而變易的緣故。</p>
<p>其實我的喜歡春雨，秋雨，黃昏以及鄕村的雨，也正和我的環境有着關係。我常事翻翻書籍，尤其是詩人們的詠雨詩，看得多了，竟因此轉移了我的愛好。「黃昏却下潔瀟雨」，固然巳經膾炙人口，「隔箇窗兒聽不得，凄凉又是點燈時」，也很能寫出這時候的心情。元朝蕭漢傑浪洶沙詞云：</p>
<p>濕逗晚香殘，春雨春寒，洒窗填戶著幽蘭。慘慘凄凄仍滴滴，做出多般。和霰撒珠盤，樓上中闌；芭蕉怨曲帶愁彈。綠遍堦前苔一片，曉起誰看。</p>
<p>這正是一關詠春雨的好詞。此外如：「幾個笠收網人歸，一肩簑賣花人去。」「任午　將愁，夜篝做冷，聽到打窗細。」「孤檠淸夢易覺，腸斷唐宮舊曲，聲迷宮漏，滴入愁心，秋似玉樓人瘦。烟檻外催落梧桐，帶西風　捎鴛甃。」所詠的，也正是春雨和秋雨。</p>
<p>歌曲里的，我記起馬致遠的一首壽陽曲來，他詠的是瀟湘夜雨，詞云：</p>
<p>漁燈暗，客夢回，一聲聲滴人心碎。孤舟五更家萬昊，是離人幾行情淚。</p>
<p>這雖然不曾明白地點出季候。但據我看來，倘非春末，就大槪是秋初，否則是不會有這一聲聲的。我們的詩人所歡喜的，是凄婉，淸幽。</p>
<p>然而，並非因爲凄婉，淸幽，却也喜歡春雨秋雨，黃昏以及鄉村的雨的人們，自然也有的。例如農人們就是。住在都市里，日常飲洗，無須用天落水，柏油馬路和士敏土房子也决不是能够容納淸幽的雨　的所在，所以大家　不多都苦雨。但鄕村却並不如此，農人們是喜歡雨的，尤其是春雨，秋雨，黃昏雨。不過他們所以喜歡的理由却不像詩人們那樣空洞，照林語堂先生的口吻說起來，他們實在是功川主義者，因爲春秋兩季是農作物需水的當兒，黃昏下雨也不至妨礙工作，倘不成災，他們是從來就不知道苦雨的。</p>
<p>而且相反地，在亢旱的季候，他們還得去求。現在的求雨方法，在我們鄕間，是備了吹打，跑到專給求雨的地方，祭過龍王，然後在一個泥潭里捕捉有生命的東西，最好是蛇，　，泥鍬，魚類也不錯，倘是烏龜或蝦呢，那就大家認爲槽糕，說這是旱象。</p>
<p>不過在從前，却並不一樣，張宗子陶菴夢憶云：</p>
<p>壬申七月，村村一雨，日日扮潮神海鬼，爭唾之。余里中扮水滸，且曰，畫水滸者，龍眠松雪近章侯總不如施耐庵，但如其面勿黛，如其髭勿蠶，如其兜鑒勿紙，如其刀杖勿樹，如其傳勿杜撰，勿　腸腔，則十得八九矣。于是分頭四出，尋黑矮漢，尋梢長大漢，　頭陀，尋胖大和尙，尋茁壯婦人，尋姣長婦人，尋靑面。尋歪頭，尋赤髮，尋美髯，尋黑大漢，尋赤臉長鬚，大索城中，無則之郭之村之山僻之鄰府州縣，用重價聘之，得三十六人。梁山泊好漢，個個呵活，臻臻至至，人馬稱捉而行，觀者兜截遮攔，直欲看然衛玠。……</p>
<p>現在的求雨方法，雖很愼重，然而比起明代的舖張來，可就顯得非常小家氣了。這究竟是進步呢，還是退步？實在難說得很。不過對于求雨的見解，古今還是一致的。袁質甫襄牖閑評云：</p>
<p>夏間久旱，四方不免祈求，而雨隨至者，多是龍捲江河之水而上，非陰陽交感而成也。觀徽眾政和七年夏，大雨，有二魚落殿中省廳屋上，其事見國史後補。雨中那得有魚。此雨是江河之水，爲龍所捲而上，無疑矣。</p>
<p>時間雖然巳經過去了八百多年，而現在也似乎不大聽見有什麽魚落到官廳的屋頂上來，不過對於求雨，大多數人却還抱着和袁質甫一樣的見解，以爲是由龍捲來的。這究竟怎麽樣呢？</p>
<p>大概也還是很難說吧！</p>
<p>不過這雖然淺薄，却並不玄妙。比起只知道喜歡春雨，秋雨，黃昏以及鄉村雨的淸幽的人們來，他們却還是較有事實的依據的。</p>

<h3 id="c231">即墨縣府的黑幕 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>在全國嚴厲禁烟聲中，卽墨縣近日竟發生一樁烟案，犯罪者皆爲縣府人員，實在很令人扼腕。八日靑島電：魯韓据報，卽墨縣府黑慕重重，職員多吸毒品，並包庇烟窩，當密派姚以价帶兵十名，七日午後一時抵卽，將縣府及商會包圍，搜出烟土烟具甚多，縣府秘書宋丹亭逃走，當將財政科長劉民生，書記孫希圖，公安局長李世昌等逮捕，商會長胡价人逃逸，捕其子家增，一併捆綁，解濟訊辦。</p>
<p>這案件的性質與平常烟案完全不同：第一，黑幕發生在一縣最高政治機關的縣府，這是不容忽視的。第二，公務人員吸食毒品，實屬知法犯法。第三，吸食而外，並包庇烟窩，亦搆成瀆職舞弊罪。第四，在縣府搜出烟士烟具，犯罪者顯係公然吸食，尤爲不法。此外，由這案件的發現，我們可以看出卽墨縣官員的腐化及政治的黑喑。好在韓主席是鐵面無私的，平時處事很嚴，現在旣巳派兵拘獲縣府人員多名，對這案件，當能依法辦理，懲戒污吏，澄淸縣治。但是烟案而外，更須注意有無其他犯罪行爲。蓋公務人員旣敢包庇烟窩，難保其不作別種罪惡。已逃罪犯，亦應從速緝捕，無使逍遙法外。</p>
<p>惟卽墨縣的烟案，雖云不幸，然我國官吏之染有烟癖的，又豈只即墨縣府幾個秘書局長而巳。至若包庇烟窩，這情形亦非少見。故我們以爲當局如果有禁絕烟禍的决心，應先將二班吸烟的公務人員革職。（至少須令限期戒除），如發見有包庇烟窩，更當從嚴處罰。蓋非如此，官吏不能以身作則，怎樣可以感化人民。不知韓主席將何以處置這個烟案的縣府職員。</p>
<h3 id="c232">酒局 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>做小孩子的時侯就聽到人家整天地談到酒局，然而，酒局是什麽的一回事呵！這好像是一個極其神秘的一個不可解的謎一樣哪。這神秘的謎跟着年紀的增長着，到了在中學唸書的時侯，還是懂得不透澈，到了離開了學校，離開了家庭，離開了所調幸福的家庭而却是一個黝黑的穴洞的環境，像輕快的小鳥兒似地在自由的圈子里飛翔着的現在，流浪到上海，又流浪到其他的小都市，然而，這個謎陣依然佔有了我的腦袋，畢竟這是怎麼的一回事哪，於是我更威到其中無限的神秘來。</p>
<p>有了一個很好的機會給我來嘗試了，於是，我一個不可解的神秘味的謎，滿可以在這機會里去探求，好像也屬於我的生活史上的一個不可缺的一頁一樣，我珍惜牠，我高興而且狂歡地來觀察牠了。</p>
<p>那是中秋節的那一天的下午，我跟着一個在小學敎書的朋友從鄉村里搭了火車到公益埠去，因為他們約定這一天在觀海酒樓開一個房間，當然的，也可以說是盡他們可能地去享受他們的靑春的幸福，然而，我呢？我從沒有過着那麼樣的生活，就是在流浪的遼遠的旅途上，我都是過着孤獨的生活的，所以，對於這一伴新鮮的熱鬧生活，我是抱着那多麽盪着的心情呵。</p>
<p>目的地巳經到了，我們跨上了觀海酒店的樓上，這兒是靜靜的，也許是經濟恐慌底下必然的結果，那麽高大的酒店却沒有一點兒生意的。就是這個好節日裏，到來狂歡的靑年人却沒有多些，只有我們這一羣罷了。我跨上房子里去時，他們巳拍拍劈劈的在打麻將，一張</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>方桌子，每一邊的一個年輕人都緊綳着烘熱的臉皮，眼睛沉着的在牌子上打轉。一個侍者在奉着茶，在送着熟的手巾，這兒，一排窗子向着南方，南方就是個火車站，工廠，酒樓的邊是一條淙流的溪水，從這兒望出去可以看到一片白茫茫的江水，遠遠的迷在雲層里的山峯，平野，村莊，一切都是沉靜的，但是這房子里的熟鬧倒使我感到生疏，不慣，心里非常的難過着，他們說他們的，他們笑他們的，他們所談的女人的故事對於我毫沒有引誘性，所以，這兒的人們雖熱鬧，但自己顯然的是孤獨，好像在別的一個可怕的世界里一樣。是的，假使我小孩子時候也去學習打麻將，也會去學幹」些所謂神秘的事件，我想一定不會有今天一樣可怕的難過的。然而，我咒咀嗎？我目前却好像一個囚徒一樣在衆人的臉前挨着諷刺，可怕的孤獨了。</p>
<p>好容易，他們打完了四個圈，那已是下午三點鐘的時候，他們就談到要叫梅花來陪飲酒局。這，我當然知道，而且，我的心又起了異樣的希求來。一會兒，梅花姑娘姗姍地跨進房子里來了。</p>
<p>她不絕任何個人的擁抱，不拒絕任何個人的接吻，在公益過着戲班的生活的三個我從未相識的靑年在弄着音樂，在唱在笑，像忘掉了痛苦似的，他們都向她玩笑。於是，房子裏顯得特別熱鬧，可是我却變了一個白痴似的在胡思亂想，我害怕，我慚愧，我不敢接近她，而且也不敢望她。這連我也不相信，我是這一羣里的一個人一樣。但是，我有時看到他們的手使她的胸部感到痛苦的時候，她就發出了哀鳴的聲音，這聲音差不多把我的靈魂打擊着一樣。她却不敢哭，也不敢咒咀，這樣子把他們的眼睛溜出了狂歡的光彩來。</p>
<p>飲酒和喫飯，把每個人都弄得火燒了一樣。於是，我的心靈也一起一伏地燒着。過了一會，他們依然繼續打牌，她已輪着的在每個位置上替他們弄了一會，她挨受着的痛苦，也許就是愉快，還有的是刺諷的言語，這樣的繼續的在昏狂的圈子里挨下去，我呢，我却在聽到裁判者的鞭笞一樣，只是默默的，這幕長久的惡劇繼續到半夜兩點鐘，也看不到一點亮亮的月兒的時候，我又跟着他們喫了一回夜餐。喫過了夜餐，一羣靑年人都走散了，我也到別房子里去躺下疲乏的身子，在胡思亂想的—這一夜，她陪着那個年靑人過夜，也許是愉快的吧！</p>
<p>第二天早上起來，我又回到她和他的房里去。那時，她像慈母一樣諷笑我；迷着眼的拍我的肩：</p>
<p>「你這小孩子，什麽都不懂的，在我們臉前受罪了。」</p>
<p>呵！我的臉紅了起來，無話可說地離開她了，可是，這神秘的謎，酒局，罪惡的酒局，我已認識了！！</p>
<h3 id="c233">燈下小擷 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>（一）古鏡</p>
<p>回到故鄉的第二天的晚上，整理書篋時發現了一方古鏡，我惘然，我彷彿把什麽都失掉了。等到略略淸醒時我却只覺得眼眶酸溜溜的。啊，這一方古鏡，這一方古鏡！那麽自言自語的，眼淚便滴在古鏡上了。那是母親遺留下來的古鏡，但據母親在時說，那是從外祖母那見帶來的。</p>
<p>因此，古鏡當然是古鏡哪！</p>
<p>我還記得外祖母的蒼蒼的白髮。這古鏡，外祖母當然照過的。可是此刻什麼地方去找外祖母的白髮呢？古鏡裏，映着我，一個憔悴，淸瘦，而又是淚眼盈盈的年少者。母親當然也曾照過的。可是此刻從什麽地方去找母親的影子呢？古鏡裏，映着我，一個憔悴，淸瘦，而又是淚眼盈盈的年少者。</p>
<p>幼時，在母親身邊，常和方妹搶奪着古鏡。誰都高興在古鏡裏看看自己的嬉皮頑臉。幾年後方妹去世，母親也去世，自己便像孤雁那樣飄到遠方去，父親只愛銜着人樣長的旱烟管，不愛照鏡的，因此，古鏡便埋在書篋裏了。</p>
<p>這回，我像一個考古家那樣，把被埋着多年的古鏡發掘着了。我欣喜，我更威到了濃重的哀傷，但我能吿訴誰？</p>
<p>鏡背的水銀已褪了色，但將鏡面的塵埃拭去，古鏡遠是明朗朗的。獨個兒照着，照着，像一個壯士殺死了所有的敵人，在一個暮秋的晚上看着自己的血肉模糊的刀子，他感到了寂寞與凄凉！時光再老下去，這方古鏡也許要到別人的手中的。但那時有誰作考古家，有誰將自己此刻，憔悴的淸瘦，而又淚眼盈盈的面顏憶想於萬一？</p>
<p>（二）聽風</p>
<p>大自然的景物大部分宜於看的，你可以看璀璨的晚霞，可以看雨後的絢爛的七色的長虹，可以看帶着露珠的羞怯怯的花朶，更可以看浩渺的萬里的烟波。</p>
<p>但我似乎特別高興聽，我覺得聽遠勝於看。聽一隻歌春的黃鸝，聽深秋的一樹的蟬聲，聽一江波濤的澎湃，聽一萬滴的雨點敲着屋頂發着琮琮淨琤的碎玉的聲音，我當然高興，但更使我高興的却是聽風。</p>
<p>移一張躺椅在園子裏，閉着眼睛聽一陣輕微的風度過綠蔭，葉子擦着葉子，這聲音是那麽徼細，這動中有靜的美的享受實遠勝於看。</p>
<p>在晚上，我常愛打開窗子孤寂地閉着眼睛躺在床上，靜聽一陣風撲上窗來，接着桌子上的書頁一張翻過來，一張翻過去，一張翻過去，一張又翻過來，這煩瑣的聲音我以爲是最好聽不過的。有時帳帷也飄動了，這使人想到自己的床便是飄盪在萬頃波濤上的孤舟，自己當然是孤舟上的孤客了。於是開着記憶的花朵，想起了一些遠在多年前的故事……</p>
<p>假若是大風，又是在深夜，那就關緊着窗子，在黑暗裏靜聽在風襲過叢林，如萬馬奔騰，如海嘯龍翻，如虎號獅吼。壓着氣靜靜的聽，漸漸會毛髮悚然了，甚至怕得不敢動一動，彷彿一動就要有什麽危險立刻掉下來似的。但腦海不容易平定，牠會想到北氷洋的暗礁，牠會想到深山中的野獸，牠會想到種種可驚可駭的事情……。因爲是聽，因爲是閉着眼睛的，所以比看更會想到種種事情上去的。</p>
<p>聽風，在我確是高興的。</p>

<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>不久，我們就入睡了。夢裏，我就夢着這位陌生的姑娘，我淸切看見她那稀疏的劉海，那蒼瘦的臉龐，那苗條的身叚，那凄婉的眼色，她又似乎用陰鬱的聲昔向我訴苦。她哭着，絕望地哭着……</p>
<p>早上，帶來的鬧鐘還沒有響的時候，有一陣嘈聲把我弄醒過來。在昏迷裏，我隱約聽見一個男人在呼叱着。我竭力張開非常沉重的眼皮，從被窩裏欠上身來。這樣，我便淸楚地聽見一個男子的怒駡同一個女人的低泣，此外還有許多嘈什的，似在排解的人聲。</p>
<p>就在這時候，我的朋友走進房來，顯然，他是早就給吵醒的。</p>
<p>「外邊鬧的究竟是怎麽一回事？」我問。</p>
<p>「是昨夜那女人出了岔子了」。他說。「趕快起身，是時候了。」</p>
<p>「凍死了累咱們吃官司，笑話！」茶房在外面嚷着說。「他媽的，黑心肝，一輩子不得好報。昨夜她熬了一夜，她</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>說回去亦是死，不回去亦是死，要死索性就死在這兒哪。這娘兒亦太硬性了。」</p>
<p>「可不是，顴骨上都着了火啦，熱得通紅的，又咳嗽。」另一個人說。</p>
<p>「究竟是什麽事呢？」我問我的朋友，「駡她的是什麽人呢？」</p>
<p>「就是『烏龜頭』啦。他還駡這裏客棧的夥計。他們差一點要打他哩，好得還有我排解」。</p>
<p>猛然，她那削瘦臉龐又浮在我的眼前了。這暴風雨中的白薔薇呵。</p>
<p>「要是她昨夜有了客人呢？」我心裏這樣想，不自覺地說了出來。</p>
<p>朋友彷彿沒有聽見我的話，他用手稱了稱那被包，用自得的聲調說：</p>
<p>「嘿，昨晚要是沒有這棉被，說不一定凍死在徐州啦！」</p>
<h3 id="c235">大街 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>——古城印象記</p>
<p>在大街上，那一點是特殊的;是高大的窗子和灰色的壁：陽光寂寞地晒在灰沙的街上，晒在灰色的天空單調地飄着的布店同酒家的布窗上面。那街中是一片「可咚可咚」地響着的洋車夫的銅鈴子聲，寂寞地鄉在灰沙裏面，那是塗上了灰色的生命呢，有着那灰色的調子哪。那全家幾口的生活在車輪上面轉着。</p>
<p>街，是有着碎石子鋪着，在那明朗的陽光里，風里，灰沙子在地面滾着，在空中迷離着。在那邊，我可以看見灰色地剝落着的城牆，同那打着瞌睡的灰色的大兵，只有着槍須在城頭上露着呢；幾隻烏鴉點綴着這寂寞的景色增添着灰色吧。</p>
<p>在大街上是寂寞着的，幾個女人伴着孩子們在瞧着熱鬧，或時會買些東西，同着掌櫃的討價還價地爭論着。那時，也有着流浪人在大街上兜着大半天，蘊着遼遠的家鄉底懷念呵，同整天地，一間着的中間人，灰色地在街上走着，走着。</p>
<p>有時，在大街上有着一個襤褸的小販，賈着孩子的玩具和糖果。小玩具在手中弄着，要着，孩子們瞧着這有趣的玩具，一對烏溜溜的眼睛不停地瞅着這一玩具的小花樣於是會要着媽媽買一個。那小販也是知趣的，他摸準了孩子這時要的是什麼；他會緊跟在孩子身邊要着一，這樣，那媽媽也買了那玩具了。這是一古城一種有趣的風光吧。</p>
<p>沿着街擺着許多水菓攤和舊物攤，在攤旁有着一個年老的，咳嗽着的老人，他們會互相地說着這，說着那，東拋西拉地談上大半天，關於一些兒子和媳婦作談資用的。也有着健談的，他們吸着那旱烟整天地談着。有時應付着顧客們。消磨着他們的時間。</p>
<p>我曾化去五個銅子，買了一只生梨，解渴，可是只咬了一口，我就棄在地上了；那味道是苦澀的，里面像棉花那般，灰沙是滿滿地塗着生梨。在古城吃一點水菓也是沒那一份幸福的。</p>
<p>大街上，什麽東西都有得買，如：煤啦，烟啦，酒啦，布啦，同女人用的小東西鈕扣和針綫啦，那些，都比來巷子里呌賣着的貴，那也是市塲的慣例吧，大街，在古城里那是鼎盛的市塲呢。現在，大街上是冷淸淸地，店堂內貨物是無人惠顧，先前在布店里是擠着許多人，在那里要着一點布，只是一片女人，和男人的聲音。現在布店里冷落着，店舖里的陳貨堆積着那麽多，也有來自東京和上海的，紅紅綠綠地在陽光里閃着，閃着。年靑的小夥計偷偷地在櫃台上打着瞌睡。市塲是在淪落者的哪：只是寂寞和灰色呢。</p>
<p>在大街上的小戲圍子裏，有着許多人去找一點溫暖着心須安慰，點綴着那灰色的生命的枯躁。大街上反而是冷落落地寂寞着，有着三四條野狗夾着尾巴在街上跑，一輛破驟車在街中「的嗒的嗒」地駛去：街上的大鼓也「得，得，得，」敲呀敲的，那也是市塲中特殊的現象吧。</p>

We have specially dispatched Comrades Wang Quansheng and Shi Zizhou, representing all colleagues, to visit and offer our condolences. We sincerely hope that you will take good care of yourselves, recover your health soon, and we wish you a speedy recovery."

Since I was injured, I have been confined to bed, and I feel deeply ashamed that I have been unable to share any of the burdens during this important period. However, I am all the more moved by the encouragement. I only hope that my disabled body will recover soon and I can do my best to live up to your expectations." (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th).</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to information from the Jizhoumi Special Commissioner's Office, the Xianghe incident has been largely resolved after Yin Rugeng used a radical approach to deal with it.

<p>(Tianjin) It was discovered in Yongqing County that traitorous people were incited by ronin to cause trouble. The county magistrate arrested five Chinese traitors, including Miao Haozhen and Liu Qiwen, and sent them to Baoding for punishment. In Qinghe and Baxian Lincheng, three counties also had traitorous people causing trouble, inciting ignorant people, surrounding the county government on the grounds of opposing donations and taxes, and demanding that the county magistrate step down. The group police captured five or six ringleaders successively and sent them to Baoding. Traitorous people in other counties who planned to riot learned from the failure of Yongqing and other counties and all disappeared. (Special dispatch, 14th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A large number of poor people's parties were found in the Wangjia Wobao and Lijiapu areas inside Xifengkou in Zunhua North, with about six or seven hundred people.

The county magistrate of Zunhua has telegraphed Zhang Chiyu to quickly send security forces to suppress them. (Special dispatch, 14th).</p>

<h3 id="e12">Sun Chuanfang's Remains Were Coffin Yesterday; The Murderer Narrates the Process of Assassinating Sun; The Public Security Bureau Will Send Him to Court <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Chuanfang's remains were coffin in his home at No. 20 Road, British Concession, Tianjin at 4:00 PM on the 14th. The funeral was presided over by Jin Yunming, Pan Fu, Ke Fenglin, Wang Chengbin, and others. Sun's wife died early, and his two eldest sons had lived separately before Sun's death. Only Sun lived with his concubine and three or four young children. The murderer, Shi Jianqiao, has been sent from the first branch to the Public Security Bureau and detained in a detention center. This morning, his family members were specially allowed to visit him in accordance with the regulations for glimpsed prisoners. Shi sent a telegram to his eldest brother, Zhongjie, in Beijing, instructing him to return home quickly to take care of family affairs and informing him that the great revenge had been avenged and that he had surrendered himself. Zhongjie is currently the captain of the Transportation Research Institute of the Military Commission. Shi's mother and his younger siblings fled in fear of being implicated when they heard that Shi had committed the murder and surrendered on the 13th. Seeing that nothing happened early in the morning of the 14th, they returned home. (14th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Public Security Bureau specially allowed reporters from various newspapers to meet Shi Jianqiao at the detention center at 2:00 PM on the 14th. Shi talked in detail about the process of the murder, saying that he had not received a high level of education, but had been strictly taught by his family since childhood. This time, killing Sun was entirely for revenge and had no other purpose. He had put a lot of effort into this matter and thought about it again and again before he found the opportunity to do it. Shi also said that he liked to read novels such as Liao Zhai and admired the filial piety of Ti Ying in saving her father and the revenge of the chivalrous girl. The Public Security Bureau intends to send him to court on the night of the 14th or early on the 15th. (Special dispatch, 14th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After Sun Chuanfang was assassinated on the 13th, his remains were put in the coffin at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th. Many relatives and friends in Tianjin went to mourn. The date of departure has not yet been determined. The murderer, Shi Jianqiao, has been sent from the first branch to the Public Security Bureau. At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, the chief of the third section of the bureau, Ma, questioned him in detail. The confession was roughly that he was 30 years old, from Anhui, and his husband's name was Shi Jinggong, who is now the head of a certain military teaching regiment in Jin. There are also two children in the family, one seven years old and the other two years old. His father was promoted from Bin to the commander of the front enemy of the Zhilu Yu Army and was killed by Sun in Bengbu in the 14th year of the Republic of China. He has been planning to avenge his father for a long time. After living in Tianjin, he often secretly visited Sun's whereabouts. Some time ago, he heard Master Sun Zhiyuan, a layman in the Jushilin, lecture on the scriptures, and then learned that it was Sun Chuanfang. He immediately bought a pistol and bullets, and then asked him to preside over and participate in the lecture in the forest. On the 13th, he killed Sun during the lecture and immediately surrendered. The bureau decided to escort Shi to the prosecutor's office of the local court for interrogation on the evening of the 14th or the morning of the 15th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th).</p>
<h3 id="e13">Private Silver Is Actively Exchanged for Legal Tender; Regarding the Use of Unsuccessful Offenders in Theft and Tax Evasion, There Are No Provisions in the Criminal Law for Comparison, and Supplements Are Being Planned <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the implementation of the new currency policy, the people are very enthusiastic about exchanging their existing silver for legal tender. Because currency is originally an intermediary for transactions, and the government has stipulated that the use of coins should be stopped, the people's retention of coins has actually lost its effectiveness. Moreover, there is a very urgent need for a legitimate means of transaction. It is expected that in the shortest possible time, the existing coins in the hands of the people can be exchanged for legal tender. In the future, in addition to dealing with the use of cash, intentional storage and concealment, and attempts to steal and evade taxes, the current criminal law has no provisions for comparison for unsuccessful offenders. The Ministry of Finance is actively planning how to supplement the regulations, and a decision can be made within days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th).</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Ministry of Finance, fearing that unscrupulous merchants would manipulate and arbitrarily raise prices after the implementation of the new currency system, telegraphed the Beiping Municipal Government a few days ago to organize a price evaluation committee to stop it. The Municipal Government will jointly organize an evaluation committee with the relevant bureaus, military police, and constitutional organs, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (Special dispatch, 14th).</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Since the implementation of the new currency order in Bing City and the suspension of the exchange of provincial banknotes, prices have soared and people's hearts have been very unstable. Recently, thanks to the efforts of officials and merchants, it has been calmed down. However, because of the control of silver and money merchants, legal tender still cannot circulate, and only a branch of the Bank of China is in name only. The market circulation is purely based on provincial banknotes, and the whole article is sluggish, and interest rates are soaring. Today, the exchange rate for Tianjin has risen to 40 yuan per thousand yuan. The 19th is the winter bidding period for the business community in Bing City. Various industry associations have held emergency meetings to discuss ways to connect legal tender and provincial banknotes and maintain market methods. The provincial government summoned the chairmen of the chambers of commerce of various counties to the province to discuss and inspect the existing and actual amount of banknotes issued by the provincial bank and various official silver shops. More than 30 counties have now reported, and a meeting will be held at the Sui Office tomorrow morning to check them separately. The chairmen jointly petitioned the provincial government because the current use of silver is biased, and legal tender has not circulated in various counties, and the market has been suspended, and the winter bidding is the lifeblood, and asked the provincial bank to borrow 2 million yuan to provide relief. The matter is currently under negotiation, and the business community will continue to hold a general meeting tomorrow morning to discuss it. (Special dispatch, 14th).</p>
<p>(Jinan) The military law office of the headquarters arrested more than ten unscrupulous merchants who raised prices and money houses that privately hoarded copper coins today and sent them to court. (Special dispatch, 14th).</p>

<p>(Xi'an) The provincial government issued a notice to the public on the 14th that the general use of silver dollars in the market to exchange for legal tender is limited to the end of the year in the north. After the deadline, it will be calculated according to the amount of pure silver contained, and a notice will be issued to prohibit the trafficking of silver out of the province. Violators will be punished according to the crime. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th).</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The market situation of copper coins in Tianjin has not improved due to the lack of spot goods.

<h3 id="e15">After the Semi-Independence of the Philippines <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The Filipino people, after breaking away from Spanish rule, have been under the American flag for thirty-seven years. Although the various constructions undertaken by the United States in the Philippines have been admired by the world, the principle of national self-determination has led Filipino patriots to demand independence and strive to break away from foreign rule for decades. Now, the United States has allowed the Philippines to become fully independent after ten years, with a semi-independent status within those ten years. The semi-independent Philippine government was established today in Manila. The American government regards this as the most important page in the history of American relations with the Far East and one of the most important achievements since the Democratic Party came to power. The President sent the Secretary of War as his representative, and Congress sent the speakers of both the Senate and the House of Representatives as their representatives, who traveled from afar to the East to participate in the ceremony. We are old friends with the United States and neighbors with the Philippines. We deeply congratulate and admire the Filipino people for achieving autonomy and the American government for fulfilling its previous promises.</p>
<p>However, we cannot refrain from saying: Is the United States' fulfillment of its previous promises absolutely sincere? Is the Philippines' attainment of autonomy absolutely worthy of celebration? Considering that the United States occupied the Philippines during the Spanish-American War, its motives were twofold: politically, to use the Philippines as a base for the United States in the Far East, thereby increasing the United States' voice in the Pacific and on the China issue; economically, to exploit the Philippines' raw materials and markets for the benefit of American business, and to use Manila as a medium to increase trade with China, like Britain's possession of Hong Kong. However, in the past thirty years, politically, the Philippines has been a burden for the United States. The area is far from the United States, close to Japan, difficult to defend, and constantly in danger of falling into Japanese hands. Therefore, military strategists consider the Philippines to be the greatest weakness in American national defense. Economically, the Philippines' raw materials, such as sugar and coconut oil, directly conflict with the domestic sugar and oil industries in the United States. Filipino immigrants have further caused fear and anger among the people on the American Pacific coast because if Filipino citizens are allowed to enter the United States without restriction, their cheap labor could deprive American people of their jobs and lower the living standards of the working class. This time, the United States allowed the Philippines to become semi-independent, largely due to the insistence of sugar and oil capitalists and worker groups on the Pacific coast. It is not easy to believe that the motive was absolutely altruistic.</p>
<p>After the semi-independence of the Philippines, the United States is still responsible for its national defense. Chief of Staff General MacArthur has resigned and come east to plan the defense for the Philippine government. However, the problems faced by Philippine politicians are numerous and complex. Even with ten times the current financial, human, and military resources of the Philippines, there is no guarantee of a solution. Internally, the complexity of race and religion, and the opposition of economic classes, are particularly dangerous. Within ten years, the United States will gradually raise tariffs on the Philippines, causing the sugar and coconut oil industries on which the Filipinos depend for their livelihood to lose their markets and decline. The past free trade between the United States and the Philippines has already seen the decline of the sugar and oil industries, let alone the abolition of free trade and the closure of the American market. Economic difficulties can easily lead to internal revolutions. Externally, the Japanese invasion is increasingly alarming. Currently, Japan is restricted by Philippine tariffs, but its cotton textile exports to the Philippines already surpass those of the United States. The Philippine industry is still immature and cannot withstand this kind of high economic pressure. Last month, the United States and Japan reached a gentleman's agreement to restrict Japanese exports to the Philippines and increase the Philippine government's import tariffs on Japanese goods. However, this kind of gentleman's agreement has minimal effect and is not enough to solve the Philippines' internal and external economic troubles. In terms of defense, with the Philippines' annual income of 54 million Philippine pesos, it is already difficult to cover administrative expenses, let alone arrange for national defense. Japan has long regarded the Philippines as part of the Japanese Empire, and it will not allow others to sleep soundly next to its bed. Its intention to intervene is also within expectations. Therefore, we are not optimistic about the situation in the Far East after the semi-independence of the Philippines.</p>

<h3 id="e34">British General Election Begins; Fierce Competition Among Political Parties; 615 Members of Parliament Must Be Elected; Ruling Party Expected to Lose Seats; Female Voters Outnumber Men <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) Britain began voting today to elect members of the House of Commons. Although the government is optimistic about the future, at least four cabinet ministers are at risk of losing their seats, namely Macdonald (Labour), who has served as Prime Minister three times and is currently the Lord President of the Council, Scottish Secretary Sir Colin Coote (Liberal), Minister of Health Sir Kingsley Wood (Conservative), and Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Elliot (Conservative). The opposition Labour Party is increasingly optimistic, believing that many of the leaders who lost in the 1931 general election have a chance of returning to Parliament this time. If so, the Labour Party's opposition to the government in Parliament could greatly increase. The sentiments of the various parties are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The government believes that victory is assured, but acknowledges that its majority will inevitably decrease. The opposition Labour Party believes that victory is "extremely lucky," but is confident that the number of seats it wins will allow it to make a substantial voice in the new Parliament. The Liberal opposition party believes that it can play a pivotal role in the election. The nation's policies, especially foreign policy, will now be tested on the world and the voters, as this election is a direct result of the East African War. The government's decision to implement sanctions against Italy to uphold Britain's support for the League of Nations and oppose Italy's plan to expand its colonies has caused a serious split in the Labour Party. By holding elections at this time, the government is not only acting in the party's interest but also seeking a new mandate from the voters for the international situation, so as to continue to support the League of Nations and pursue a policy of strengthening national defense in accordance with international developments. The Labour Party has always advocated peace, but party members have sharply divided opinions on the issue of implementing sanctions to maintain peace. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, finds that most of its foreign policy aligns with the government, and many are taking advantage of the situation to switch sides. The government has now shifted the nation's attention to foreign affairs, causing domestic issues such as unemployment and social welfare to be neglected. The opposition parties naturally use these issues as weapons in their struggles. In short, the opposition parties have indeed made much progress in the constituencies in recent months. It is generally predicted that the government's majority will be between 100 and 250 seats. The opposition parties' chances have increased slightly during the election campaign in the past week. (Fourteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) A total of 615 members of the House of Commons must be elected, but there are no contests in 40 seats, which have already been decided. Prime Minister Baldwin is among them. Polling stations opened as early as 7:00 AM this morning, and many others started operating from 8:00 AM. Voting will continue until 8:00 or 9:00 PM, depending on local conditions. The weather is good today, with occasional sunshine. Baldwin drove from his residence at 10 Downing Street to Westminster to vote at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Experts from all parties say that the government is certain to be elected, but its current majority of 404 seats will inevitably be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Since the last general election, the number of voters has increased by 1.5 million, and their political opinions are difficult to discern. Female voters outnumber men by 1.75 million. It is expected that the results of the 225 rural constituencies, totaling 232 seats, will be known tonight. The results of the remaining areas, except for a few, will be known tomorrow night. The British Broadcasting Corporation will broadcast the results as they are received from 10:00 PM tonight to 4:00 AM tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>All parties expect the government to suffer the greatest losses in the 225 rural constituencies. In the last parliament, the government party held 197 of these 232 seats, and the opposition party held 35 seats. In the 1929 parliament, the Conservative Party held 77 seats, the Labour Party held 138 seats, the Liberal Party held 14 seats, and independents held 3 seats.</p>
<p>Four cabinet ministers, including Macdonald, are at risk of losing their seats. Another four cabinet ministers, namely Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halifax, the Secretary of State for War, Lord Londonderry, the Lord Privy Seal, and Lord Zetland, the Secretary of State for India, are not affected by the election because they are members of the House of Lords. All four are affiliated with the Conservative Party. (Fourteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e35">British Voters: Over 25 Million. Number of Seats Held by Each Party in the Last House of Commons <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) Tomorrow is the date for the general election of the British House of Commons. This is an unprecedented grand showdown of British political parties in four years. According to British election law, both men and women who are 21 years of age or older have the right to vote. Therefore, it is predicted that the number of voters will be over 25 million. The current British House of Commons was elected on October 27, 1931, and the distribution of seats for each party is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Government Party</p>
<p>Conservative Party: 471</p>
<p>National Liberal Party: 68</p>
<p>National Labour Party: 13</p>
<p>Independents: 2</p>
<p>(2) Opposition Party</p>
<p>Labour Party: 52</p>
<p>Liberal Party: 4</p>
<p>Independents: 5</p>
<p>Total: 615</p>
<p>From the above table, the National Cabinet holds an overwhelming majority of 554 seats in the House of Commons, and therefore has been able to govern for four years, with its foundation unshaken. However, judging from the by-elections and municipal council elections in recent years, the opposition Labour Party has often been victorious. The National Government can no longer obtain the majority support it received four years ago, which is indeed due to failures in domestic policy. Therefore, in this general election, the Labour Party may have hopes of making a comeback. Optimists in the Conservative Party predict that the Labour Party will only be able to obtain 175 seats, which is more than 120 seats more than in the last election. If this is the case, the Government Party can still maintain an absolute majority. However, according to the speculation of Lord Stobart, a Labour Party senator, the Labour Party can win a majority of 30 to 40 seats, that is, the number of seats obtained is often more than 330. In general, the following estimates are most likely: the Labour Party will win between 200 and 230 seats, the opposition independents will win 10 seats, the Samuelite Liberals will win 10 to 20 seats, and the Government Party will win 350 to 400 seats, which is still a majority of 100 to 160 seats. However, there are a large number of voters in the British election who do not participate in voting, of which 1.5 million voters do not easily reveal their attitude during the election period. Therefore, it is difficult to foresee what the result will be. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The general election of the British House of Commons was held today. The final result of the vote will depend on the number of votes of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is divided into two factions, one led by Home Secretary Simon, which belongs to the government faction, and the other is the Samuelite faction, which is the anti-government faction. The two factions have a total of 211 candidate members, of which 41 are from the Simon faction and 178 are from the Samuelite faction. In each constituency where the Simonite Liberals have nominated candidates, the confrontation between the Government Party and the opposition Labour Party is very clear. However, in the areas where the Samuelite Liberals have nominated candidates, a triangular struggle has been created. The Samuelite faction is probably only able to obtain a few seats, but because the votes of the opposition are scattered, it is enough to allow the Government Party to obtain benefits. As for the constituencies where the Liberal Party has not nominated candidates, the Liberal Party advises voters to vote for candidates who accept the "Programme for Peace and Economic Reconstruction." Only about 20 Conservative Party candidates have accepted this programme, and only one-third of Labour Party candidates have accepted it. For this reason, in the majority of constituencies where the Liberal Party has not nominated candidates, most Liberal voters will be at a loss as to what to do. The number of votes of these voters is estimated to be nearly 1.5 million, and their voting attitude is questionable. Therefore, it is difficult to predict what the election result will be. According to various speculations, the Conservative Party will still win a majority, but it may be reduced by 100 seats compared to its original seats. If so, whether the National Cabinet can continue to exist will depend on the attitude of the Simonite Liberals and the Conservative Party "Diehards" (i.e., the right-wing Conservative Party led by Churchill). If the Simonite Liberals and the right-wing Conservatives leave the Government Party, the Cabinet will not be able to sustain itself. The Simonite Liberals advocate free trade, while the right-wing Conservatives advocate extreme protectionist tariffs and imperial isolation policies. The two are extremely opposed, and it will be very difficult for the government to mediate between them at that time. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The election campaign of each party has become increasingly heated. 1,300 candidates are today displaying their debating talents, making their final speeches. The Labour Party has been wary of elections since 1924, fearing that a similar Zinoviev Letter will appear again, leading to the collapse of the first Labour Cabinet. However, their concerns have not yet become a reality. The Labour Party candidates attempted to force the Government spokesperson to explain Baldwin's defense spending, but to no avail, because the Government candidates refused to discuss this issue.

<h3 id="e36">The Anti-British Movement in Egypt: The Situation Remains Serious; More Deaths and Injuries in Yesterday's Riot <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Cairo: The situation in Cairo remains serious. Last night, the public took to the streets in demonstrations, protesting against the government and Britain's attitude towards the Egyptian constitution, causing disturbances. There was more trouble this morning. About 1,000 rioters, each holding sticks and other objects, attempted to enter Cairo from Giza. 200 policemen went to stop them. As a result, a major conflict broke out. The police fired shots into the air to no avail. A policeman, for the sake of self-defense, drew his pistol and shot down four attackers, killing one and injuring three. The crowd was frightened and scattered. The Egyptian government decided that if university students do not resume classes on November 16, all universities will be closed for a week starting from the 17th. The government is now doing its best to maintain order, and infantry are stationed on all major streets. It is reported that in the riots of the past two days, a total of three people have died and 147 have been injured, half of whom are policemen. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Cairo: Riots broke out again today, with clashes between police and students, resulting in the death of one student and serious injuries to nine others. Thus, a total of three people have died and 200 have been injured. The authorities are deeply concerned that this disturbance may spread to various provinces, and are now investigating the instigator. Italian influence is quite strong in Egypt, which makes the authorities pay more attention. (National dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Cairo: Riots broke out again tonight. The public attacked police stations with glass bottles, bricks, and other sharp objects. The police were unable to suppress them and fired shots, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Earlier, the National Autonomy Party held a meeting and passed two resolutions: (1) do not cooperate with the British, and (3) demand the resignation of the Lessim government. This government was established on November 15, 1934. During the day, a mob smashed the windows of the British consulate and attacked a large Greek store, and committed other atrocities. The riots stemmed from a speech made by British Foreign Secretary Hoare at the Lord Mayor of London's annual banquet last Saturday. The Foreign Secretary stated that in the section on British-Egyptian relations, Britain had advised Egypt not to restore the constitutions of 1923 and 1930, because one had already proven to be unimplementable and the other had proven to be unsatisfactory to public opinion. However, the Foreign Secretary denied that Britain opposed the restoration of a constitution suitable for Egypt's needs. Once the news that Britain did not want Egypt to restore its constitution spread, politicians were greatly indignant. Last night, the National Autonomy Party held a meeting and resolved to cancel the assistance given to Prime Minister Lessim because he did not disregard Britain's advice. As a result, the political situation became increasingly turbulent, and there were riots yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Premier and Foreign Minister Laval received British Ambassador Sir Clerk this morning. It is reported that the discussion between the two parties was about the procedures for replying to Italy's protest letter. The countries concerned will generally consult each other through diplomatic channels, so as to present the same reply to Italy. As for the joint reply, if it is to be implemented, it is necessary to convene the Sanctions Scheme Adjustment Committee for a meeting to discuss it. This seems to be overemphasizing the significance of Italy's protest letter, and it has been decided to abandon it. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from important sources, after consultation between the British and French governments, the British government has decided to reply to Italy's protest letter separately. France will also do the same. The content of the replies will be the same, so as to maintain the consistent action maintained by both parties in Geneva. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Mussolini's threats of commercial warfare against the countries participating in sanctions are enough to strengthen the attitude of the League of Nations member states. All parties believe that Mussolini's actions may cause more severe sanctions by the League of Nations, and will not ease its established plans. However, the general public also feels that Italy's domestic orders and the note sent to the League of Nations are all for domestic consumption, nothing more than to show the people that any obstacles to his East African campaign are opposed. The French representative has always paid close attention to Germany's attitude. Now that Hitler has expressed his strict neutrality, he is very pleased. Austria also seems to have slightly changed its openly pro-Italian attitude today. Austrian Foreign Minister Waldernegg's statement in Vienna that Austria also coordinates with other countries to prohibit arms exports is considered noteworthy here. The Austrian Foreign Minister also said that although Austria still maintains "considerable" economic relations with Italy, the arms embargo will be implemented.

<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Ambassador to Italy Drummond negotiated to reduce the tense atmosphere in the Mediterranean. According to the news here today, there were many disputes in the conversation. Drummond first suggested that Italy reduce its troops stationed in Libya to 45,000, and Britain also withdrew the two ships, Hoot and Lennen, currently stationed in the Mediterranean. Mussolini wanted to expand the scope of the negotiations, suggesting that the British Mediterranean fleet should be limited to 440,000 tons, and 340,000 tons in peacetime. Mussolini also suggested that Italy control the eastern end of the Mediterranean, from the south of Sicily to Istanbul in Turkey, while Britain controls the western end. However, according to reliable sources, if Italy formally proposes this suggestion to divide the "sphere of influence," it will definitely be rejected. (National News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>Silver Industry Association's Thirty-Four Members, Totaling Approximately 320,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Following the Ministry of Finance's announcement of the new monetary policy, the existing silver inventory of various money exchanges in the city was required by the Chamber of Commerce to be reported in detail by the 11th for submission to the municipal government. According to Wu Kaitian, a representative of the Money Industry Association who attended the Chamber of Commerce meeting, currently, in addition to over ten money exchanges such as the Shantou group which have not joined the association, there are over forty member exchanges. The existing silver inventory of each exchange is truly as rare as phoenix feathers. This year, silver and money merchants mostly used banknotes for transactions. Therefore, the implementation of legal tender will greatly stabilize the city's finances and will have absolutely no impact. On the 9th, the Money Industry Association also convened a general meeting of members regarding the investigation of inventory. Over the past two days, the following exchanges reported their inventory: Fuchengchun with 28,327.17 yuan in banknotes; Maofa with 9,211 yuan; Yongtai Zhuang with 8,886 yuan and 20 yuan in silver; Suisheng Zhuang with 2,832 yuan and 28.5 yuan in small foreign currency; Hetong with 11,493.08 yuan; Hefeng with 942.75 yuan; Zhangyuan with 2,174.14 yuan; Yongfu with 8,372 yuan; Yingtong with 13,002.5 yuan and 14 yuan in silver; Jinhuiquan with 5,413 yuan; Jinbaohe with 18,664 yuan; Longyi with 14,422 yuan, 204 yuan in Hong Kong currency, and 39 yuan in Luzon paper currency; Yangyi with 21,799.3 yuan, 333.45 yuan in silver, foreign silver, and obsolete silver; Limao with 12,448 yuan in banknotes; Yongji with 7,442 yuan and 5 yuan in cash; Shunqing with 15,658 yuan and 26.5 yuan in cash; Heyuan with 2,817 yuan and 20 yuan in silver; Zhongfu with 11,111 yuan; Huaji with 6,482 yuan, 124.5 yuan in silver, foreign silver, and obsolete silver, and 0.68 yuan in small foreign currency; Siming with 7,706.07 yuan; Yongkang with 11,566.3 yuan; Yuansheng with 7,922.52 yuan; Linshengmao with 1,567 yuan; Yinan with 3,833.12 yuan; Jincheng with 13,302.89 yuan; Hete with 14,742 yuan and 55 yuan in silver; Dachuan with 1,822.91 yuan, including 20 yuan in cash; Youheng with 18,774.2 yuan; Tongyuan Zhuang with 4,287.3 yuan in banknotes; Dingyuan with 3,313.75 yuan in banknotes; Xinjianli with 3,771 yuan; Dasha with 3,920 yuan and 12.76 yuan in large and small foreign currency; Yingfeng with 1,639.2 yuan in banknotes; and Yuanda with 2,800 yuan in banknotes. The total inventory of 34 exchanges is approximately 320,000 yuan. The remaining exchanges, including Yutong, Taiyuan, Honglong, Yinjiang, Shunmeicheng, Huaqiao Yinyie, Tongji, Nanyang, Tongheng, and Jinyuan, reportedly have no inventory. In addition, there are 23 money exchanges that have not joined the Money Industry Association, including Keming on Datong Road, Chengmei, Chenglong, Taofeng, Huaan, Chengxing, Wanfeng on Siming North Road, Nanxing in Tingzai Xia, Zhongyuan, Zhangji on Kaiyuan Road, Yuantong, Liansheng, Tongan Company on Haihou Road, Kunyuan, Lianchang on Ci Street, Xinrong on Zhongshan Road, Shengyi, Siyu, Yuanli, Xingfa, Xiexing on Shuixian Road, Defeng on Chenguang Road, and Liangji on Hengzhu Road. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting them to dispatch personnel to conduct a detailed investigation directly. (November 13th)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the currency reform, although the surface situation in the city seems stable, the actual impact has been significant. Each hundred yuan of silver can be exchanged for 140 to 150 yuan of legal tender. Copper coins have decreased from 260 coins per yuan to 240 coins. Due to the lure of profit, despite strict prohibitions, silver continues to be smuggled out of the country in a continuous stream. Major stations along the Jiaoji Railway transport a considerable amount to Qingdao daily. Due to diplomatic relations, it is difficult to crack down. Current banknotes now have different values, and commodity prices have naturally soared. Flour has increased from 2.8 yuan per bag to 3.3 yuan. Wheat has increased from 4.5 yuan per 100 Jin Dan to 5 yuan. Newsprint has increased from 3.5 yuan per ream to 4.8 yuan and is still difficult to purchase. Lead has increased from 15 yuan per pound to 20 yuan. Kerosene has increased by 1.5 yuan per barrel. Other necessities such as oil, rice, yarn, and cloth have also soared in price. Those who rely on wages and labor for a living are constantly complaining. However, business in various stores is increasingly sluggish. The city has been in decline for some time. Even at low prices, there are no customers. Now that prices have increased, even fewer people are asking about them. If prices are not increased, it means losing capital. Their suffering is no less than that of consumers. Moreover, non-essential goods such as silk fabrics and leather goods still cannot increase in price. Only those who purchase goods with silver not only do not pay a higher price but even pay a lower price. Despite efforts to prohibit it, it cannot be stopped. At the same time, the city's finances remain tight. Banks are still not providing loans. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the situation is urgent. If no measures are taken to maintain it, the end of the year is approaching, and it is feared that most of the businesses will not be able to survive. Therefore, it plans to petition the Provincial Government Construction Department to fundamentally find ways to provide relief and to first order banks to provide loans to alleviate the current crisis. The petition is as follows: (According to the order from the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, a proclamation and measures for issuing and using legal tender are to be copied and disseminated for immediate notification, etc. Upon receipt, it is noted that the national monetary system must be controlled. Now that the banknotes of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank are legal tender, all merchants and civilians should unanimously support them. However, due to the city's extraordinary financial difficulties, the number of businesses closing down is increasing daily. The end of the year is approaching in an instant, and there is no way to inject capital. There are even more unimaginable consequences. The reason for this is that business is sluggish and unsustainable. However, the fact that banks generally do not provide loans, resulting in a lack of capital turnover, is a major factor. All kinds of business activities, mutual exchange of goods, and balancing of profits and losses all rely on banks as the central hub. Therefore, business</p>

<h3 id="e80">How do wind, rain, thunder, lightning, dew, frost, hail, and snow occur? <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>(Lectures to the national public on November 4th and 6th)</p>
<p>— Professor Huan Yong of Central University</p>
<p>(I) The topic of this lecture is "How do wind, rain, thunder, lightning, frost, hail, and snow occur?" It is not an easy task to compress such a complex topic into a very short time. I will reluctantly divide it into two lectures. Today, I will first talk about how wind, rain, and thunder occur.</p>
<p>What is wind? Wind is a flow of air. The Earth's surface is surrounded by a layer of air of considerable thickness. In ordinary times, we perceive air as colorless and odorless, and sometimes we hardly notice its existence. However, when it flows, it can sometimes make a whooshing sound. If we can acknowledge the existence of wind, then we must acknowledge the existence of air.</p>
<p>During the hot summer, we need a gentle breeze. In winter, we fear the bitter north wind. How does wind actually occur, and why are its properties so different?</p>
<p>We see that water is constantly flowing. Its direction of flow is always from high to low. The so-called nature of water is to flow downward. Water does not inherently have a downward-flowing nature, but because it is subject to the Earth's gravitational pull, it has no choice but to flow from high to low until it reaches a level. In other words, the flow of water is also due to water pressure. Water at a high altitude has a greater downward pressure, while water at a low altitude has a lower downward pressure. The greater pressure overcomes the lesser pressure, so water at a high altitude has to flow to a low altitude. However, this water pressure is still produced by the Earth's gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Although the substance of air is thin, it is also subject to the Earth's gravitational pull. Therefore, it also has downward pressure, which is what we call air pressure. The flow of air is the same as the flow of water, flowing from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. Weather maps published by meteorological stations and weather forecasts published in newspapers often use terms such as "high-pressure" and "low-pressure." High pressure is where the air pressure is higher, and low pressure is where the air pressure is lower. In high-pressure areas, wind tends to flow outward, while in low-pressure areas, wind tends to flow inward. We humans live in the lower layer of the air, just like fish living on the seabed in the deep sea. Although we cannot see the height and thickness of the air layer, we can see the direction of airflow or wind from the level of air pressure.</p>
<p>Usually, meteorological stations or observatories observe the wind by looking at its direction and speed. The direction of airflow is mostly from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. Usually, wind direction is described using the four cardinal directions (east, south, west, and north), or by adding southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest to form eight directions, or even more precisely with sixteen directions, or even thirty-two directions. As for the strength of the wind, it depends on the difference between high and low air pressure. The greater the difference in air pressure between two places, the stronger the wind; the smaller the difference, the weaker the wind. As for the temperature of the wind, it depends on its source. It is hot if it comes from a hot place, and it is cold if it comes from a cold place. For example, our winter wind mostly blows from the north. The weather in the north is cold, so the wind is also cold.</p>
<p>Air often contains water vapor. The source of this water vapor is mostly evaporated from the surface of the sea, the surface of the river, and even the humid land surface. Like air, water vapor is usually invisible. When water vapor cools, it re-condenses into water droplets. Small water droplets remain in the air due to the buoyancy of the air. This is what we call fog and clouds. Low-lying water droplets are called fog, and high-lying water droplets are called clouds. These are all tiny water droplets in the air. When the water droplets become larger, the air cannot support them, and they will fall down. This is what we call rain. Therefore, rain is when water vapor rises, is cooled, condenses into large water droplets, and then falls down.</p>
<p>As for thunder and lightning, they are originally the same phenomenon. The sound we hear is called thunder, and the light we see is called lightning. These are all variations of electricity. Water vapor in the air, especially in clouds, can generate and carry a large amount of electricity. Air is a relatively poor conductor of electricity. When electricity in the sky wants to reach the ground, or when electricity from one cloud wants to reach another cloud, it encounters the resistance of the air, which can produce light and sound. However, sound travels slowly and light travels quickly, so we often see lightning first and then hear thunder. During heavy rainstorms in the summer, the electrical charge in the air is very strong. Sometimes, it can pass through trees, houses, and even human bodies, causing lightning strikes. Nowadays, tall buildings are mostly equipped with lightning rods, using metal wires to conduct the current and prevent it from passing through the building. Because metal is a better conductor of electricity than buildings, the electricity travels through the metal wire, and the building can avoid lightning strikes and even being damaged. Thunder and lightning are a very common natural phenomenon and are by no means controlled by gods in the dark, as some people think.</p>
<p>The above briefly describes the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. How dew, frost, hail, and snow occur will be discussed next time.</p>
<p>(II) Today, I will continue from the last time to talk about how dew, frost, hail, and snow occur. Last time, I talked about how water on the ground or sea is heated and evaporates into vapor, which stays in the air and is called water vapor. When water vapor cools, it newly condenses into water droplets. Small water droplets float in the air and become clouds. Larger water droplets float near the ground and become fog. If the water droplets are too large, the air cannot support them, and they fall directly down as rain.</p>
<p>The changes of water vapor in the air are not limited to these three types of clouds, fog, and rain. When the sun sets on summer evenings, the ground temperature slowly decreases. The air temperature is often slightly higher than the ground temperature in an instant. The water vapor in the air is not low enough yet and has not reached the point of condensation, but the ground is cool enough. The water vapor in the air can condense into water droplets when it encounters the surface of the ground or grass and plants. This is called dew. Dew and fog are essentially the same thing, but one condenses on the ground, and the other condenses in the air. The two cannot coexist at the same time. If there is fog, there will be no dew; if there is dew, there will be no fog. In foggy weather, the ground is moistened by the fog droplets in the air and can also become moist, but that is not dew. Whenever there is cloudy weather, the clouds can prevent the ground from dissipating heat, and the temperature does not easily decrease, so dew cannot form. Dew also does not easily form when there is a strong wind.</p>
<p>Frost and dew are essentially the same thing. The ancients said, "Dew congeals into frost." Frost is not congealed from dew. However, when water vapor condenses on the ground, if the temperature is above the freezing point, it becomes dew; if it is below the freezing point, it becomes frost. This is entirely due to the difference in temperature. It is not that water vapor first congeals into dew and then congeals into frost. Dew mostly forms in summer and autumn, while frost forms in late winter and early spring. Whenever frost forms in the evening, the temperature must have dropped below the freezing point. Delicate plants cannot withstand the invasion of frost, so they inevitably lose their leaves and turn yellow when frost falls.</p>
<p>Snow is to rain as frost is to dew. In the high altitude, if the water vapor's temperature decreases and is above the freezing point, it forms clouds and rain. If the temperature decreases and is below the freezing point, the water vapor will condense into snow. Snow is directly condensed from water vapor, not formed from water droplets or raindrops. Sometimes water vapor condenses into fine ice needles that can also remain in the air, such as the cirrus clouds that are commonly seen.</p>
<p>Snow often falls in winter, while hail often falls in summer. Snow is a tiny flower, while hail is a block of ice. Snow often falls in winter when it is cold, and because the low temperature at that time is sufficient to kill pests on the ground, people often call it auspicious snow. Hail often falls in the hot summer when crops are growing. Whenever hail falls, it often causes disasters. The nature of snow and hail is so different, so the circumstances of their occurrence are also very different. Snowflakes are directly condensed from water vapor, while hail is a mixture of snowflakes and raindrops. During the summer, the ground temperature is hot, and the air rises, causing strong convection. Whirlwinds can also occur. The airflow sometimes rises and sometimes falls, without any certainty. At this time, the water vapor contained in the airflow cools or condenses into snow. When it descends, it may turn into water. When it rises again, it freezes into ice. In this way, rising and falling are uncertain, and the hail block increases in weight repeatedly. Finally, it reaches the ground. Small ones are like peas, large ones are like chicken eggs, and some are even larger. When hail falls to the ground, not only are livestock in the fields struck, but also crops are beaten, causing them to break and die prematurely. The area where hail falls may not be too wide, and the chance of hail falling is also very rare, so the damage is also relatively shallow.</p>
<p>The dew, frost, hail, and snow mentioned above, as well as clouds, fog, rain, and dew, are all transformed from water vapor. Water evaporates and becomes water vapor, which accumulates in the air. Water vapor condenses into clouds, fog, dew, frost, hail, snow, and rain due to the decrease in temperature. Among them, except for floating clouds, all fall back to the ground, either as sweet dew, severe frost, auspicious snow, or disastrous hail. And the rain that falls also has the distinction between timely rain and floodwater. Their impact on human life has different advantages and disadvantages, but they are all changes produced by water vapor. If there were no air on the ground and no changes in this water vapor, then all living things would not be able to exist. What we call meteorology is the specialized study of all the changes in wind, clouds, rain, and thunder in the atmosphere. If we want to know when there will be storms, when there will be sudden rains, when there will be frost, and when there will be hail, in order to ensure the safety of aviation, navigation, and agriculture, forestry, and killing animals, meteorological stations or observatories must be widely established in various places to make accurate forecasts based on precise records. Only in this way can we avoid mistakes. (The End)</p>

<p>The transportation of goods is frequent, the market is prosperous, and they usually help each other and are in great need of each other. Recently, as soon as the banks in the city saw that the financial situation was tight, they stopped providing loans even more and earnestly pursued the repayment of loans that were due. With only inflows and no outflows, it has become exhausted. Various industries are showing signs of panic. As a result, businesses that have been forced to close down are emerging one after another. If we wait until the end of the year to close the accounts, in addition to the slightly original business numbers that may barely survive, all the others will have to cease operations. In order to maintain finance and relieve the market, we earnestly request that Your Excellency order the banks to provide loans as usual to maintain commerce, not to be unduly worried, and to take advantage of the difficulties of the people, only to seek personal gain and disregard public welfare. Then commerce will be fortunate, the region will be fortunate. In addition to submitting to the Department of Construction and sending a letter to the Department of Finance, we hereby submit a written request to Your Excellency for examination and approval and order immediate implementation. Respectfully presented by Chairman Han, Jinan Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Ma Duo, director of the Central Bank of this city, recently convened the city's financial community to explain the meaning of the currency reform and separately investigate the amount of foreign currency and types of banknotes held by various money exchanges and silver houses. However, since the suspension of silver, the number of chips in the market has suddenly felt tight. It has recently been heard that in order to provide emergency relief, the central government has allocated 300,000 yuan of legal tender. Ma Duo fears that this will still not be sufficient and has specially telegraphed the head office to allocate another 300,000 yuan of 1 yuan, 0.5 yuan, and 0.25 yuan legal tender. Mr. Ma originally planned to transfer a portion of the collected silver, about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, to the central government for reminting into subsidiary currency. Later, fearing that this would have a negative impact on local finance, he has decided to stop the transfer. Mr. Ma also visited Governor Han Fuqu of the provincial government on the afternoon of the 11th to report on the progress of the handling. (November 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Hubei Provincial Government Confirms Water Management Improvement Plan <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Repairing Dikes Addresses the Symptoms, Dredging Addresses the Root Cause, Pursuing Both Separately. Central and Local Governments Divide Responsibilities for the Yangtze and Han Rivers.</p>
<p>Hankou Communication:</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Basin is a region of national wealth. The Han River flows through lands abundant in cotton and rice. Hubei, located between the Yangtze and Han Rivers, benefits from irrigation. However, in recent years, neglect of water management has led to frequent flooding. Over a decade ago, the Wangjiaying levee collapsed. Fifteen years ago, the Jianli Shiwan levee collapsed. The large-scale disasters of the twentieth year (of the Republic) and this year have caused particularly heavy losses to officials and civilians. The surging Yangtze and Han Rivers have almost become a source of calamity. The provincial government, learning from past mistakes, believes that addressing both the symptoms and root causes is necessary for lasting security. It has formulated eight improvement plans for water management, determined to implement them with maximum effort. The main points are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Reinforcing the Yangtze River Dikes in Hubei:</p>
<p>In water management, dredging is important for lowering the water channel, but reinforcing and securing the dikes remains crucial for flood prevention. After the Yangtze River dikes in Hubei were reinforced according to the flood level of the twentieth year, their height and thickness were considered adequate for protection. However, this year's water level exceeded the record of the twentieth year, causing many dikes in the upper reaches to be overtopped and breached. For safety, the dike tops must be raised by two meters, and the dike surface increased to sixty meters, with slope ratios of three and an average inner slope of one to six. Although this will be costly, failing to do so would entrust the livelihood of the nation to fate. The future danger is unimaginable.</p>
<p>(2) Dredging the Yangtze River:</p>
<p>The Yangtze River, flowing from Sichuan into Hubei, carries a strong current. It meanders between Yichang and Zhijiang, and receives the Ju and Zhang Rivers in Jingzhou, before merging with the Dongting Lake at Jinghe Nao, further increasing its momentum. Passing through Gong'an, Songzi, Shishou, and Jianli, the river course twists and turns, frequently becoming blocked. Its flow is lost into lakes, hindering regulation. This section of the Yangtze River is the most damaging to Hubei. Further downstream, places like Chenglingji, Baota Zhou, Jia Yu Gorge, and Ezhou Bay are particularly winding, impeding the water flow. Near Yangxia, it merges with the Han River, further increasing its volume. Flowing eastward, it is obstructed by the Qingshan and Xisai mountains, and constricted by Tianjiazhen, causing sediment buildup and the formation of sandbars. The accumulated floodwaters engulf Wuhan, causing a "fullness" and swelling. These are all causes of the water leaving its channel and flooding. Given the urgency of the current flood situation, dredging is imperative. In the Jinghe area, both the lake and river should be addressed, repairing the openings to the lake and restoring the original channel, using the lake's capacity to absorb the river and the river's flow to drain the lake. From Jianli to above Jinkou, river bends should be straightened to reduce meandering and turbulence. Therefore, effective methods should be adopted swiftly, sufficient funds raised, and both symptoms and root causes addressed, with dredging and repairs carried out simultaneously, to alleviate the suffering of our people.</p>
<p>(3) Managing the Xiang River:</p>
<p>The Xiang River originates in Shaanxi, flowing a thousand miles into Hubei. Similar to the Yangtze emerging from its gorges, it receives the waters of the Tang and Bai Rivers between Junzhou and Laohekou, further increasing its momentum. With flatlands on both banks, relying solely on levees to contain the river, frequent breaches and flooding cause great disasters. It is indeed a highly irregular riverbed. The plan is to block breaches, move back remote levees, and uniformly raise and reinforce all levee lines to prevent overflows. Meanwhile, upstream from Yunxi to above Xiangcheng, suitable terrain will be selected to build flood detention basins, forming reservoirs with the surrounding valleys. Alongside these, spillways will be constructed, allowing floodwaters to be temporarily stored. Only a safe flow rate will be allowed to gradually discharge from the spillways, achieving flow control. Between Zhongxiang Xiangkou Town and Dawang Temple, a diversion dam will be built, allowing high water levels to divert flow into the Tianmen River, through Diaowen Lake. The silted and shallow natural river channels will then be dredged, allowing the water to enter the Xiang River from X溝 (a new channel) and the Yangtze River from Chenjia Ji. This will reduce the flow of the Xiang River in the middle reaches and alleviate the threat to the northwest of Hankou. Furthermore, tributaries such as the Cekou River, Tongshun River, Niuti River, and Yejia River will be dredged in order of urgency. Large river bends along the river, such as Yangzikou in Hanchuan, will be straightened, allowing the water to flow through the land, ending the water woes of the people near the Han River.</p>
<p>(4) Planning for This Year's Construction:</p>
<p>After this year's floods, levee funds have been exhausted, and the people are destitute. Raising funds for both construction and relief is extremely difficult. It is imperative to make comprehensive plans where possible. The entire Xiang River and the silted and breached dikes of the upper Yangtze River have caused great suffering to the people. All levee repair projects should employ work-for-relief, using a lottery system to ensure benefits reach the people. Detailed plans have been formulated through consultation between the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and the General Relief Association for Water Disasters. As for the Yangtze River downstream from Xiy魚 (喜魚), except for Hanyang County, which suffered severe damage, most of the dikes and embankments (堤垸) remained intact. To compensate for the levee fund shortfall, it is proposed to conscript labor without pay to reinforce the main dikes, leveraging the power of the people to defend their own territory. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau should work with the General Relief Association for Water Disasters and the Department of Civil Affairs to thoroughly investigate areas not affected by the disaster but related to the dikes, and the number of able-bodied men in each area. They should also estimate the amount of earthwork, draw up charts, and assign sections to the heads of districts, *bao*, and *jia*, tasking them with conscripting laborers. The technical guidance will be provided by the engineering offices. The Tangzhuba dam project on the upper Xiang River should be contracted out. The dredging projects in the middle and lower reaches will be carried out as work-for-relief. Due to the difficulty in raising such large sums, it is proposed to use a military engineering accounting method to save costs and make the project easier to implement.</p>
<p>(5) Establishing Levee Management Agencies and Rationalizing the Division of Levee Section Jurisdiction:</p>
<p>The dikes of the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei extend for thousands of miles, but the Jianghan Engineering Bureau has only established seven engineering offices to manage them. One office manages dike sections as long as five to six hundred *li*, requiring them to cross rivers and take care of both banks, handle annual repair projects, and face difficulty in supervision. During floods, dangerous situations arise frequently. More offices should be established where necessary to facilitate management. Long-distance telephones should be installed along the route to allow the conditions to be communicated at any time. The engineering offices will respond accordingly to avoid missed opportunities. The important river dikes should be managed by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. However, due to the existing decisions from the levee work conference of the fifteenth year of the Republic, some Yangtze River dikes are excluded from the main dikes, such as the Jingjiang Dike in Jiangling and the Wuhui Dike in Wuchang. These should be included as main dikes under government repair to avoid mutual blame between officials and civilians during peacetime, and mutual avoidance during floods.</p>
<p>(6) Strengthening the Authority of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and the Supervisory Guidance Power of the Provincial Government:</p>
<p>The Jianghan Engineering Bureau is directly subordinate to the National Economic Commission in terms of system. In reality, it should follow the orders of the Provincial Government, and the Bureau should have considerable freedom in making decisions. However, everything, regardless of urgency, must be reported to the NEC thousands of miles away. The annual repair projects, after long-term investigation by the engineering offices and review and design by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, are often reduced by more than half by the NEC. This year, dike breaches occurred in many places where construction had been cut. As for the Provincial Government, it is not informed of the investigation and estimation, so it cannot exercise its guiding power, and it does not participate in the acceptance inspection, so it cannot fulfill its supervisory responsibility. In peacetime, official correspondence only creates unnecessary paperwork. The NEC should grant the Jianghan Engineering Bureau the power to select annual repair projects and allocate flood control funds and materials, without undue interference, to avoid delays. The Provincial Government bears the responsibility for the land and people of the province, so it must pay close attention to the dikes, which are closely related to the land and people, to ensure the appropriateness of the investigation and repair plan and the solidity of the repairs. The NEC must inform the Provincial Government to send personnel to jointly investigate and inspect to ensure the completion of its mission. The supervisory and guiding power during flood control should be completely entrusted to the Provincial Government for effective response. The NEC should only review the reimbursement afterward.</p>
<p>(7) Dividing and Organizing Water Conservancy Administration and Funding:</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan's outline for unified water conservancy administration and undertakings stipulates that water conservancy projects involving two or more provinces should be managed by the central water conservancy authority. The water conservancy administration of this province is already managed by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau established by the NEC, which mainly manages the Yangtze River, which seems to comply with the outline. However, in terms of managing the Han River, it should not belong to the central government. The NEC only handles dike funds in Hubei to manage dikes within Hubei and does not coordinate the water conservancy of the entire Yangtze River basin, which further undermines the meaning of the central agency managing local dikes. It is proposed to request that the NEC review the outline for unified water conservancy administration and take over the management of all Yangtze River water conservancy and dike projects to both reinforce the dikes and prevent current disasters and to raise large sums for fundamental dredging. The Xiang River only affects one province, so the local government should manage its dredging and repairs. As for the central government's Yangtze River management funds, there is much to be raised. Among the provinces along the Yangtze River, only Hubei has special dike funds. The sources of Hubei's dike funds are three types of surcharges: customs duties, special taxes, and land taxes, yielding about 1.2 million yuan annually. The customs duty surcharge accounts for 1.1 million. It is reasonable to levy Yangtze River construction donations from customs duties along the river. Hubei has been independently levying dike donations for the past decade, and the donation rate is quite high, but merchants are happy to pay. Yangtze River management should not be limited to Hubei, so the customs duty surcharge can be extended to the entire river. It is proposed that all customs offices from Chongqing to Shanghai levy a water conservancy donation at a rate of 5%, which would yield 10 million yuan annually, making any large-scale project feasible. The annual cost of Xiang River repair and defense is about 600,000 yuan, which is taken from the three types of surcharges for the Yangtze River dike project. It is now proposed that the central government universally levy donations from all customs offices along the river, and the Hubei customs duty surcharge will be abolished at the same time. The special tax revenue is decreasing due to the strict prohibition of opium, and it will disappear in a few years. Only the land tax surcharge remains, yielding about 100,000 yuan annually, which is insufficient to manage the Xiang River. It is proposed to request that the central government allocate one-tenth of the customs duty surcharge for a period of ten years to subsidize the province's Xiang River water storage, flood reduction, and other fundamental projects. The funds for reinforcing dikes and local dredging will be raised and managed, and conscripted labor will be used.</p>
<p>(8) Organizing and Managing Civilian Dikes:</p>
<p>Building dikes is the least desirable strategy for water management, and branch and civilian dikes often compete with water for land. In recent times, the lake surface has shrunk, and the river flow has narrowed, largely due to people building dikes to enclose silt. After the great flood of the twentieth year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek proposed returning fields to the lake, which can be said to have identified the problem. However, not all dikes hinder the water flow, and people have long relied on them for survival, so they cannot be abolished without careful consideration. Hubei is located between the Yangtze and Han Rivers, with numerous tributaries and winding channels. The number of civilian dikes and their importance to national taxes and people's livelihood is comparable to the main dikes. Before a detailed water conservancy plan is comprehensively determined, they must be properly organized and reasonably regulated to avoid their harm and preserve their benefits. Civilian dikes are often low and thin, and those behind the main dikes often collapse first due to the pressure of the rising water in the inner rivers, then impacting the back of the main dikes. These should be investigated, and the beneficiary people should be ordered to reinforce them according to the height and slope of the main dikes.洲 (zhou - island) dikes outside the main dikes, except for those that excessively obstruct the water flow and must be abolished, are allowed to be repaired as before. For civilian dike repair projects, beneficiaries are assigned labor and fees based on acreage, and the government only supervises. However, after the flood, civilian dikes are mostly destroyed, and people are focused on saving lives, so assistance must be provided. The importance of the benefits and the financial strength of each area will be assessed, and subsidies or loans will be provided to help restore rural areas. (12th)</p>

<p>Regarding the robbery of a Shanghai-Hangzhou highway joint transportation vehicle on the afternoon of Double Ten Day (October 10th), the Provincial Chief repeatedly ordered strict investigation and arrest, and dispatched teams to increase protection to ensure the safety of travelers. County Magistrate Li followed the orders and dispatched water patrol teams and security brigades to protect areas such as Zhaolin, Jinshanwei, and Shanyang Caojing. The case was purchased with lines and investigated. Now, the perpetrators of this case have been captured by Water Patrol Team Captain Fei Gongxia, together with Security Brigade stationed in Shanyang platoon leader Shu Wenming. On the night of the 12th, they each led soldiers to surround the Water Den (Shuike), first capturing bandit Zhang Xiaobaogen. He confessed that he and He Xiaohshang and four others robbed the car, and he was disguised as a villager, bought a ticket to get on the car, and He waited to intercept the car halfway, damaged the tires, and boarded the car to carry out the robbery. He then led them to Shanyang, and captured He Xiaohshang, who claimed to be from Shaba Tu. After robbing the car, he robbed eight guns from the Wanghengjing guard post, and then went to Zhujiahang to rob, encountered the guard post passing by, and once opened fire to resist arrest. Zhang Xiaobaogen was sick when the arms were robbed, but the stolen arms were hidden in his place and used to rob the wealth of a certain family in Shenjiaqiao, and he received two yuan. The two criminals have been taken back to the team headquarters to prepare documents to be reported to the county government for legal interrogation, and the remaining bandits are still being hunted down.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Wu, considering the rampant number of thieves in the villages and the approach of winter, initiated preparations for winter defense to maintain local security. He convened a meeting of the heads of military and police agencies and decided to establish a winter defense office, which has already been organized and established. Urban and rural areas are divided into six districts for joint defense, starting on the 15th of October. The defense of the urban area is mainly based on the land police, and the rural area is mainly based on the Provincial Security Brigade. From the start of the winter defense, passwords are required in the urban area after midnight, and suspicious people are checked.</p>

<p>The son of farmer Qi Qianlin, Zhihai, of Gangtou Village, Xixiashu, 3rd district, Wujin County, was kidnapped at night on the 18th day of the second lunar month of the 18th year of the Republic by kidnappers Lu Zonghan and Jiang Yizheng. Because villagers were catching around the four sides, they knew the hostage could not be obtained, so they used a pistol to shoot and kill Zhihai and then fled. The two bandits Lu and Jiang kidnapped Jing Jisheng's son Peiying in Dingqiao Township nearby on the 23rd of the same month. After failing to extort a ransom, he was also torn apart. In May of this year, the bailiffs of the local court, accompanied by informants, successively arrested Lu Zonghan and Jiang Yizheng in Lucheng, Danyang and other places. After investigation and clarification by the procuratorate, he filed a lawsuit with the criminal court and repeatedly summoned the principals and others for confrontation. On the 13th, the sentence was announced. The main text briefly stated that Jiang Yizheng and Lu Zonghan jointly committed two crimes of kidnapping for ransom and intentionally killing others, and each crime was sentenced to death and deprived of public rights for life, and each should be executed by death. The verdict was swift and the people were satisfied. The two bandits still declared their dissatisfaction in court and will file an appeal.</p>

<p>Zhao, the wife of Feng Wanjin of Doutianmiao Street in the city, beat her adopted son Zaosheng to death in the afternoon of the 10th. When the county government found out about this, he arrested the Feng couple to the county. On the 11th, he sent Judge Zhang Shuhan to investigate. The corpse site was in front of the Qian Gen Banner Pole Land Temple. As a result, the deceased Feng Zaosheng was found to have multiple scratches from his fingers on his face and neck, and multiple rows of woodenware wounds from his ribs to his legs below his arms, and burns on his left shoulder and knife wounds on his left calf. The commissar was beaten to death during his lifetime. After Commissar Zhang reported after the inspection of the coroner Cao Zemin, he personally saw the wound certificate again, and then ordered the corpse's father (that is, Feng Zhao's brother) to take it back for burial. The court was opened for interrogation in the afternoon. Feng Zhao confessed without a word. He was shackled and imprisoned for sentencing in court. Feng Wanjin was handed over to bail because he was innocent. He will be summoned again.</p>

<p>In the 8th day of this month, your newspaper, in its third edition, carried a news item about three people who had gone missing in Tianjin for days, including the name of our librarian Yao Jinshin. After checking, Librarian Yao goes to the library every day to work and is very diligent. The saying of missing is probably an untrue rumor. I am afraid that the rumor will be spread and cause misunderstanding. I have specially sent a telegram and respectfully hope that you will correct it, to be grateful for. Some newspapers here have the same record, and I have also sent a letter requesting correction. Sincerely, Tianjin Municipal Library</p>
<h3 id="e90">A Review of the Philippine Independence Movement (Part 2) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Hanfang</p>
<p>When President Wilson left office, he wrote a letter to Congress, saying: "Allow me to draw your attention to the fact that the political autonomy of the Filipinos is almost a success. For their benefit, and in accordance with what we have previously allowed them, it should be transformed from an ideal into a reality."</p>
<p>(6) The Special Committee's Investigation Report on the Philippines. After President Harding took office on March 4, 1921, he appointed a special committee, and former Governor General Wood and Cameron were sent to the Philippines to investigate all the circumstances and then make a report to the U.S. government, which would then use it as a basis to formulate a policy requiring American recognition and support. This special committee spent four months traveling throughout the Philippine islands and contacting the Filipino people extensively.</p>
<p>The report of this special committee has been published. Its contents are roughly the opinions of the U.S. President and the instructions to the special committee. There is also a brief history of the Philippines and the living conditions of the Filipinos. The more important part of this report is the analysis of the current situation in the Philippines. Now, in relation to the independence movement, a few paragraphs are quoted below:</p>
<p>We feel that the people of the Philippines are happy, peaceful, and value the benefits of American rule.</p>
<p>We feel that in every part of the Philippines, Filipinos who believe in Christianity hope for independence. Ordinary people under American protection, non-Christians, and Americans all hope that the United States will continue to govern.</p>
<p>We feel that if, after independence, it is still under the protection of another country, it is not true independence.</p>
<p>We feel that from the past eight years of experience, Filipinos have almost had a de facto autonomous government. If the United States abandons its political protection, withdraws its army and navy, and carelessly allows this island nation to be managed by the powers, while seeking the fertile land and various future commercial interests, then it can be said to be unjust. In short, if we withdraw from the Philippines and terminate our relationship with them without giving the Filipinos a good opportunity to establish an orderly and permanent autonomous government, then it would be a betrayal of the Filipinos, a misfortune for the Americans, blocking the path of Filipino progress and causing them to regress. Isn't such neglect of America's due obligations a very shameful matter?</p>
<p>We propose that the United States maintain the current state of the Philippines until they have full autonomy.</p>
<p>We propose that the United States have a responsible representative, the Governor-General of the Philippines, whose powers should be consistent with his position.</p>
<p>We propose that when a dispute arises between the Governor-General of the Philippines and the Philippine Senate regarding appointments that cannot be resolved, the U.S. President has the power to approve or reject and decide.</p>
<p>We propose that the U.S. government should not be willing to take responsibility for various undertakings on a certain island without actual power.</p>
<p>(7) Reasons Why the United States is Slow to Grant Independence to the Philippines. The reason why the Philippine independence movement has not been realized for a time is ultimately the conflict of practical interests. Further analysis reveals the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, reasons of national defense. The future situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly perilous. Japan is naturally a thorn in the side of the United States. Furthermore, the Netherlands has the East Indies, France has Indochina, and Britain has Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Malay Peninsula, all of which have a deep foundation in military and commercial terms. If the United States does not have a Philippines as its naval base, then it will not be able to maintain the balance of power in the Far East, and the United States' great commerce in the Far East will be in some danger. The British naval admiral stationed in Hong Kong once said, "If the American flag is lowered in Manila, the British flag will be raised in its place." Americans also often say, "If the Americans withdraw from the Philippines in the morning, the Japanese will enter in the evening." This is because the United States is very wary of the powers surrounding the Philippines. This is the reason why the United States is unwilling to easily give up the Philippines and quickly grant the Philippines independence due to national defense concerns.</p>
<p>Second, economic reasons. Since 1909, free trade has been practiced between the United States and the Philippines. The United States, as the suzerain power, has annual trade worth 100 million yuan to the Philippines. If a 20% tariff were levied, 20 million yuan could be saved. Furthermore, every year, the Philippines imports wheat produced from 200,000 acres, cotton produced from 100,000 acres, and apples from 3,150 acres of orchards, with cars worth over 1 million yuan. If the Philippines becomes an independent country, then both countries will lose the benefits of free trade. Other countries, with low labor costs, will sell tobacco, sugar, hemp, and coconut oil to the U.S. market, and of course they will be able to win. There will naturally be many obstacles to the import of American products into the Philippines. Moreover, the Philippines owes the United States a total of 70 million gold yuan, and the United States has invested 20 million yuan in the Philippines. They believe that once they leave the Philippines, they will inevitably suffer a loss of 100 million yuan. Therefore, from an economic perspective, the United States is also unwilling to easily grant the Philippines independence for a time.</p>
<p>(8) The Success of the Independence Movement. Since the Philippine independence movement began in 1907, they have continued to struggle unceasingly. In recent years, the Filipinos have been influenced by the doctrine of national self-determination, and coupled with the ardent national patriotism, the independence movement has reached a mature stage. Independence movement leaders such as current President Quezon and Senator Osmeña are the most enthusiastic. They have successively gone to the United States, using peaceful methods and a sincere attitude, to make strong requests to the U.S. authorities and people. In fact, the achievements of the United States' rule over the Philippines for more than 30 years have been evident to the world. Although it cannot be separated from being an imperialist, the policy it has adopted is generous, with no territorial ambitions, and has a style of encouraging and supporting small and weak nations. This is beyond the reach of the selfish and self-interested colonial policies of various countries on the European continent. In all fairness, since the Americans ruled the Philippines, their management of the Filipinos has been extremely free, never as harsh as the Dutch and British treat their colonies. Moreover, the number of American administrative personnel stationed in the Philippines has been gradually reduced year by year. When the author visited the Philippines five years ago and observed its various government agencies, the number of American officials was almost zero, which shows their attitude towards the Philippines. The United States granting independence to the Philippines was originally a matter of time. However, when the internal strength of the Philippines was not sufficient, the United States, due to national defense issues and economic reasons, was not in a good position to abandon it immediately. This year, both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have passed the Philippine Independence Act, allowing it to establish an autonomous government immediately, with the United States responsible for maintaining the independence of the Philippines for ten years. The reason why there is such a satisfactory solution is that the various reciprocal conditions for free trade and commerce between the United States and the Philippines still exist, so economics is no longer a problem. The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force are still stationed in the Philippines, ostensibly to deal with the situation in the Pacific, but in reality, they still regard themselves as protectors of the Philippines. Moreover, the U.S. promise to grant independence to the Philippines should not be repeatedly given verbally but not actually delivered. Therefore, the Philippine independence movement of more than 30 years can be said to be completely successful today.</p>
<p>The Philippine autonomous government has already been established, and the first president, Quezon, has also been elected. On November 15th of this year, a grand celebration was held to mark the official establishment of the new Philippine government. The United States specially sent U.S. Vice President Garner and Army Chief of Staff Bourne, among other important figures, to participate. This move is indeed sufficient to express the friendship between the peoples and governments of the United States and the Philippines. However, on the other hand, this invitation has a profound intention. The Philippine government and people hope that they will get to know the administrative and legislative personnel who will reform Philippine affairs in the new government, and be able to understand the administration of the new government personnel in the Far East and on the island, and the result will be that the new government personnel will have convenience in future legislation. From this, it can be seen that the cooperation and friendship between the United States and the Philippines continue to exist.</p>
<p>The Filipinos have raised the banner of independence high, establishing a brand new independent and national state in Asia. Its position in the international community will be on par with the independent countries of China, Japan, and the Philippines. Furthermore, the relationship between China and the Philippines is particularly close. We have more than 200,000 overseas Chinese residing in the Philippines, who hold a leading position in the economy. Moreover, China and the Philippines have a long history of relationship, with intermarriage and ethnic groups being extremely close. From now on, we come to celebrate the success of the Philippine independence movement and the genuine friendship, co-existence, and co-prosperity of China and the Philippines in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Ministry of Finance Orders the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Sincerely Convey the Central Government's Intentions; the Central Government's Assignment to the Three Banks to Stabilize Foreign Exchange Has Been Effective <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a public notice stating that after the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications became legal tender, the entire country would comply, strictly prohibiting the private transportation of silver and the raising of prices, and ordering the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to sincerely convey the central government's intentions. The three banks have stabilized foreign exchange and have achieved results. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry Order Conveying the Central Government's Intentions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance approved Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Document No. Qian Zi 7808, stating: "The telegram has been received. The stabilization of prices has already been telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering them to handle it conscientiously. If there are those who seek to speculate and raise prices, they should be punished according to the law without any leniency. As for stabilizing foreign exchange prices, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications should be responsible, and the Ministry has issued orders to the relevant banks to observe the market conditions at any time and assist in handling them. Now, at the time when the unified issuance and centralized reserve measures have just been implemented, a small number of people may not yet understand. The Chamber of Commerce is still requested to sincerely convey the intentions of the Central Government, so as to stabilize the market, stabilize people's minds, and lead the country to prosperity. This is of utmost importance. This order."</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Private Transportation and Raising Prices</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has already ordered all customs offices to strictly investigate the private transportation of silver, and has at the same time consulted the provincial and municipal governments to assist. It is now heard that a small number of cigarette shops and small money houses are buying silver, with the aim of seeking small profits. After receiving the report, they will immediately pay close attention and severely punish the investment merchants who buy silver. As for stabilizing prices, the provincial and municipal governments have already been telegraphed to handle it conscientiously. If there are those who seek to speculate and raise prices, they should be punished according to the law without any leniency. As for the four items previously determined by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to prohibit the raising of prices, they have already been approved for filing by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Stabilizing Foreign Exchange Has Been Effective</p>
<p>Regarding the case of stabilizing foreign exchange prices, the Ministry of Finance issued orders to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to observe the market conditions at any time and cooperate in handling them. Now, Xi Demao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, and Zhang Peishen, Manager of the Business Bureau of the Bank of Communications, meet every day at 10:00 a.m. in the Foreign Exchange Department of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank to discuss stabilizing prices, without restricting the buying and selling of foreign exchange. This has been effective, and the prices have been very stable in recent days. Yesterday, the prices announced by the Central Bank for foreign exchange of five countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, and Japan, were the same as the day before. As for the equalization tax rate, it is still 57.25%.</p>
<p>Currency Exchange Rates Have Become Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the money market saw single and double jiao coins at 833 yuan and 3 jiao. Copper coins were at 300,000 per thousand, exchangeable for 1,200 jiao. Cloth tokens were at 3,000 wen, jiao blanks at 250 wen, and interest at 50 wen. However, the various cigarette shops saw a surge in exchange rates due to the large amount of copper coins sold by the public bus company and the tram company, with each yuan exchangeable for 10 jiao and 480 wen, up to 12 jiao and 10 wen, and copper coins at 2,960 wen to 3,150 wen. Double hao coins were at 490 wen to 510 wen, which is already equal to the standard of auxiliary coin prices stipulated by the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Li Zongren has decided to come to Beijing within days. He previously reported to Kong Xiangxi, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, that he would set off on schedule. The original telegram is as follows: "To Kong Xiangxi, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, Yongzhi Sir, Upon reading your gracious telegram, it is clear that as the national crisis is pressing, we should go together. I am deeply moved and inspired by your distant encouragement. Recently, Mr. Dai and Mr. Ma came and conveyed the earnest expectations of the gentlemen of the Central Government. How dare Ren slight himself? I have now decided to enter Beijing to receive your instructions in person. However, having been away from Guilin for a long time, I intend to return to Yong first to make some arrangements before setting off on schedule. As for the conference, Chairman Huang Xuchu and Zhang Renmin, the staff officer of my department, have attended to participate. I myself extremely endorse the resolutions of the conference. I have received your instructions for some time. I respectfully reply by telegram first. Your younger brother Li Zongren greets you."</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Obeys Orders to Suppress Price Gouging, Stipulating Prices Under Two Principles <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance implemented the new monetary policy, there have been instances of excessive price increases in the city. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to stabilize market prices, has been ordered to strictly suppress them. According to a report from the Central News Agency reporter to the person in charge of the bureau, after the bureau was ordered to suppress excessive price increases, it immediately began to investigate the costs of various commodities. The interests of the industrial and commercial sectors should naturally be taken into account, and the purchasing power of general employers should also be considered at the same time. Prices will be stipulated under these two principles. Now, the industrial and commercial sectors can comply with the bureau's investigation of costs and stipulation of prices. Among them, there are those who need foreign raw materials and other imported goods, and the prices are higher due to exchange rate reasons. This phenomenon does not harm the national industry and commerce, and may even be beneficial. However, for export commodities, due to the decrease in the price of silver, they will gradually increase in the future. This is also a good phenomenon for restoring the balance of international trade.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Municipal Joint Association Writes to the Authorities, Requesting Strict Suppression of High-Price Buying of Silver <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Citizens' Joint Association of the First Special District of this city, after the government resolutely reformed the monetary system this time, surprisingly, a group of unscrupulous merchants and unemployed vagrants were used by others to pay high prices to buy silver. In addition to notifying the district branches and ordering store members to pay close attention, the association yesterday sent another letter to the Public Concession Bureau, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Citizens' Joint Association of the Special District, requesting that they instruct their subordinates to strictly investigate. The original letter reads: "We respectfully inform you that our government, for the sake of consolidating the national foundation and stabilizing society, announced on the 4th of this month that the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would be legal tender. The people of the whole country, upon hearing this, were overjoyed and sincerely supported it. Surprisingly, in the Hongkou District of this city, a small number of unscrupulous merchants and unemployed people are being used by others to disregard laws and regulations, sending people out in all directions to pay high prices to buy silver, which is truly hateful. We have already notified the district branches and ordered member stores to pay close attention. However, according to reports, the number of these traitors has increased in recent days. If they are not strictly investigated and dealt with, it will not be enough to warn those who are cunning and playful. We hereby send this letter, requesting that you instruct your subordinates to strictly investigate and deal with them. To the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Public Concession Bureau."</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Municipal Public Security Bureau Re-Investigates the City's Household Registration, Issuing Forms on the 16th and Collecting Them on the 19th <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, considering that the city's household registration is not very detailed and complete, specially obtained approval from the Municipal Government to allocate funds to conduct a special large-scale investigation to improve it. He has repeatedly convened meetings at the bureau with the directors and staff members of the subordinate branch bureaus, household registration patrol officers, etc., and decided to organize an investigation team, promoting Hong Qi, the chief of the Second Section, as the team leader, and Li Zemin, the director of household registration, as the deputy team leader. The staff members of the branch bureaus are the company commanders, the household registration patrol officers are the platoon leaders, the police chiefs are the group leaders, and the police officers are the group members. There are a total of about 1,800 staff members, all wearing white cloth armbands with "Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Household Registration Investigation" printed on them. They have also printed notices and household registration forms, and it is scheduled that on the 16th of this month, the team leader will lead the departure, investigating and persuading door-to-door, and distributing a notice and a household registration form to each household, requiring them to fill in the number of men, women, and children truthfully, and to complete and submit the forms by the 19th, without hiding or omitting anything. If they are unable to write, the police officers will write on their behalf, and they will be required to complete the procedures and report them by the end of this month. It is also heard that the purpose of this special investigation of household registration is: (1) to clarify the city's population, (2) to accurately know whether there are any omissions in the number of opium smokers, (3) to determine the effectiveness of the literacy movement among the people of this city. After this investigation, the household registration procedures of each branch bureau will also be reformed. In the past, the triangular sign used for household registration mainly used the street name and house number. Now, because this sign is not very agile during inspection, it will be changed to a card book cover, with the name as the standard. It will be more convenient to check the population when needed than the street name and house number.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Industry and Commerce established the Mining Financial Adjustment Association and announced the news, many mines applied for loans, intending to allocate 10 million yuan to relieve domestic mine owners. Personnel were sent to investigate the situation of each mine in order to verify the applications. It is learned that the investigation of about three or four mines has been completed, and the information has been reported to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. After approval, the mine owners will be notified to come to the association to discuss the contract. However, the amount of loans applied for by the mines has exceeded 10 million yuan, so when verifying the loans, they will be reduced according to the amount of assets and the prosperity of the business.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter yesterday from its Jiangwan branch office stating that there were no exchange agencies for the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, or the Bank of Communications in the district. They proposed that the Chamber of Commerce forward a request to the municipal government to designate the Land Tax Collection Office and the post office as agencies for exchanging legal tender for convenience. The Chamber of Commerce immediately replied, stating that on the 6th of this month, they received Order No. 56 from the Shanghai Monetary Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. The order stated that in remote areas where the banknotes of the three banks were not yet widely circulated, those holding silver coins or silver should be able to exchange them for legal tender. Therefore, the Ministry had ordered the three banks, all banks and money shops, all public associations, all tax collection agencies, and all state-run enterprises (such as postal, telegraph, railway, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company bureaus) to act as exchange agents. The Chamber of Commerce had already notified all public associations, member merchants, and branch offices of this order on November 7. The Jiangwan office could simply notify the merchants in its jurisdiction to exchange silver coins or silver for legal tender at the Land Tax Collection Office and the post office without needing to forward a request for specific designation.</p>

<p>The municipal government stated that while the city was calm and peaceful, rumors were rampant, preventing citizens from living and working in peace and causing panic. Even foolish people were confused and agitated by unfounded rumors. Those who create rumors and cause trouble disrupt public order and are extremely hateful. Therefore, the municipal government strictly ordered the Public Safety Bureau to secretly dispatch officers to investigate and arrest those responsible. It is reported that the Public Safety Bureau arrested five rumormongers (Wang Jisheng, Wang Shiting, Zhang Xiaotang, Lu Guangyou, and Gao Xuanqiu) yesterday in the Tiantong'an Road and Baoshan Road area. They have already requested instructions from the municipal government. The municipal government, considering the case to be serious and related to disrupting public order, has ordered the suspects to be handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for strict handling.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the sunning of Shanghai-preserved antiquities at the Beiping Antiquities Exhibition Hall has been intense since it began last month. The initial estimate was two months, but because the antiquities were not moldy, the work progressed faster. According to the person in charge, all the work could be completed by Monday of next week (the 18th). Approximately 1,000 pieces of calligraphy, paintings, and embroidery have been sunned, all in good condition. The cost of this project was 4,000 yuan, allocated by the Ministry of Interior in advance. Fu Yiwen, section chief, and others who came to Shanghai to oversee the sunning, plan to leave Shanghai and return north on the 19th. The person in charge denied rumors that the antiquities would be transported to Beijing for safekeeping soon, stating that they might be transported to Beijing after the antiquities storage facility in Beijing is completed.</p>

<p>Christianity was introduced to our country from the West more than a century ago. The number of believers and the scale of the work are well known to the Chinese people. However, because all the work and financial resources were completely dependent on friendly foreign people, thirty years ago, Presbyterian pastor Yu Zongzhou believed it was a great shame for the Chinese people. He resolutely initiated a self-governing church, named the Chinese Christian Self-Governing Church in Shanghai. Soon, the whole country responded and established self-governing churches. He achieved great success. This year, November 17, marks the third anniversary of Yu's death. Yu passed away at the age of eighty. It is reported that the National General Council of the church has scheduled a memorial service for Yu Zongzhou this Sunday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the General Church on Xiangyin Road.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Automobile Drivers' Trade Union, the Hotel Industry Trade Union, and others sent a telegram to the Fifth Plenary Session requesting that employees' debts should enjoy the highest priority of repayment. The telegram read: "To all members and representatives of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, the congress is grandly opened, and the people are joyful. At this time of national crisis and hardship for the people, we rely on your planning and decision-making to reverse the tide. Our trade union has read the suggestion made by lawyer Zhou Lianze, a member of the Chinese Labor Association, to your congress, regarding 'Priority Payment of Employees' Debts.' We endorse this proposal sincerely as it relates to the interests of all members of our trade union. Since unified laws and regulations have not been formulated, most employees have no basis for claiming priority payment of their debts, and they may starve. The nature of employees' debts is different from the nature of other debts, and they should not be compared. For example, drivers' and workers' guarantee deposits, and hotel waiters' and servants' deposits, are not clearly regulated in national legislation, and they are greatly affected by the lack of legal protection. We hope that all members and representatives of the congress will consider the late Premier's intention to protect labor and the hardships of the working masses. Please approve the suggestion, submit it to the Legislative Yuan for amendment, and clearly enforce it. Then, the workers of the whole country will be blessed, and the nation and the people will be fortunate." Signed, Shanghai Hotel Industry Trade Union, Shanghai Taxi Drivers' Trade Union.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Public Concession: Industrial Accident Report for October <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council reports that there were a total of 150 accidental events in the factories of the Public Concession in October. Compared with the total number of over 200 incidents in the first half of this year, it seems that there has been much progress. However, it is still difficult to determine whether the actual number of accidents has decreased sharply, because the reporting may not be ideal or widespread enough. Furthermore, this matter is related to the economic depression in Shanghai. If factories are closed or reduce production, the number of accidents will naturally decrease accordingly. Among the above accidents, six people died, and two women were injured. Classified by industry, the highest number of accidents still occurred in the machinery and hardware industry, with a total of 48 incidents, but no deaths. The construction industry reported 16 incidents, with 2 deaths. The textile industry reported 14 incidents, with 2 deaths. The food and beverage manufacturing industry reported 8 incidents, with 1 death. The transportation industry reported 9 incidents, with 1 death. As for the causes, among the six deaths, five were due to falls from heights, and 30 people were injured by falls. The remaining death was due to burns.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Flying Girl Brand Cigarettes: Verification of Stamp Authenticity <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>All brands of cigarettes produced by the Luxin Tobacco Factory at No. 19 Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession are distributed and sold wholesale by the Yixin Distributor at No. 549 Avenue Joffre. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, inspectors Zhou Baosheng, Zhu Qiming, Zhao Chengen, and others from the Shanghai French Concession Cigarette Inspection Office of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance inspected the Yixin Distributor. They found that the stamps of the Shanghai Cigarette Inspection Office and the Nanshi Inspection Office on the wrappers of 29 boxes of Flying Girl brand cigarettes produced by the Luxin Tobacco Factory (500 cigarettes per box, totaling 14,500 cigarettes) were inconsistent. The original stamp was suspected of being counterfeited. On February 1, February 18, and July 31 of this year, markings had been made on the lines printed on the stamp. It was believed that the Luxin factory owner, Yu Luxin (35 years old, from Shandong), had counterfeited the stamps to evade taxes. Yu Luxin was arrested and sent to the Special No. 2 Court for investigation and detention on the afternoon of that day. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the criminal court judge interrogated him in the Criminal Division No. 1. A lawyer representing the Cigarette Inspection Office stated that the Police Department had not yet completed the investigation procedures for identifying the stamps of the Inspection Office and requested a postponement. The defendant denied the forgery and hired a lawyer to defend him. The court ordered a postponement to the 19th for further interrogation, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Located on a plot of municipal land of 1.363 mu in the Jiutu Luziwei area of the South Shanghai District.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a densely populated city with a mix of Chinese and foreigners. Refugees and deserters from various places often come to Shanghai to beg along the streets. This not only harms the city's appearance but also hinders public order. Therefore, Cai Jinjun, director of the Public Safety Bureau, found a plot of municipal land in the South Shanghai District that is suitable for building a refugee and deserter shelter. He sent letters to relevant bureaus a few days ago, proposing to jointly report to the municipal government for approval to use the land for the construction of the shelter. Cai Zengji, director of Finance and Land Bureau, replied to the Public Safety Bureau yesterday, stating that the Public Safety Bureau's letter No. 1726 of November 9th regarding the municipal land plot No. 2 in Jiutu Luziwei of the South Shanghai District, measuring 1.363 mu, had been inspected and found suitable for building a refugee shelter. He requested that the relevant bureaus jointly report to the municipal government for approval to use the land for building the shelter. He stated that the construction of the refugee shelter should be handled by the Public Safety Bureau and that the relevant report should be submitted by your bureau.</p>

<p>The various provincial flood relief associations in Shanghai believe that this year's floods are severe, far exceeding previous years. Moreover, it is already winter, and people are suffering from hunger and cold. Even if they do not starve to death, they will freeze to death. Therefore, this relief work cannot be delayed. The flood relief association has appealed to all parties for donations and has successively held various entertainment activities to raise funds. Since the start of fundraising, thanks to the enthusiastic support of all parties, the results have been satisfactory. Recently, a general flood donation and a scout mobilization fundraising were held. The two days of external fundraising have ended, and the results have been excellent. The scout teams are now soliciting donations from relatives and friends. This fundraising will end on the 17th, and the funds raised will be collected and announced after the teams turn them in. The China Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing Plant has decided to sell 30,000 bottles of its Sanxian soy sauce at the original price, with one-third of the proceeds donated to disaster relief. This can benefit the most disaster-stricken people. Soy sauce is a daily necessity, made using scientific methods. The plant's actions benefit both people and itself. The sales method has been determined. The company has contacted the Shanghai Scout Council to sell these vouchers to relatives and friends. These vouchers have been sent out yesterday. Those who hold these vouchers can go to the plant's distribution office to choose soy sauce of various colors. The money can be paid directly to the scout, or the flood relief temporary office on the third floor of the Youth Christian Association in the Eight Immortals Bridge area. Ms. Meng Xiaodong and Ms. Zhang Heyun were invited to perform at the Golden Theater for disaster relief, and the performance was very successful. It is reported that the performances of Ms. Meng and Ms. Zhang are limited to ten days, after which they will return north. Therefore, this time is purely for disaster relief, and all expenses are borne by the performers. There are not many performance dates left.</p>

<p>Qiu Feihai, a tennis player from Xiamen, drove his friend's car No. 6474 at around 6:00 AM on July 30 of this year, passing Foch Road in the French Concession. Due to the driver's negligence, he hit and killed the ten-year-old daughter of Huang Hanting, from Jiangxi, who lived at No. 29 Ci Hou North Li, Ha Tong Road. Lawyers Fan Gang and Huang Xuanzhang filed a criminal lawsuit and an attached civil suit in the Special No. 2 Court against Qiu, requesting damages of 11,400 yuan. Qiu also hired a lawyer to defend him. The trial concluded, finding that Qiu was indeed negligent and sentenced him to a fine of 300 yuan and damages of 2,000 yuan to the plaintiff. Qiu, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Senior Third Branch Court. The plaintiff, Huang Hanting, believing that the original sentence was too light and that the attached civil suit was insufficient, also appealed to the Senior Third Branch Court. The High Court, upon receiving the complaint, held a hearing yesterday, presided over by acting Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, accompanied by judges and prosecutors. Both appellants were represented by lawyers. Lawyer Fan Gang stated that the plaintiff had also filed an appeal, but both parties had reached an out-of-court settlement. Because the procedures had not yet been completed, he requested a three-day extension to allow the settlement to be finalized and the appeal to be withdrawn. Chen Zhongyin, the lawyer, stated that the appellant, Qiu Feihai, had gone to Singapore and was not in Shanghai. A friend was acting on his behalf to reach a settlement, but the withdrawal of the appeal had to be sent to Singapore for Qiu to sign himself and returned for submission. The mailing would take two weeks. The court approved both parties' requests for a postponement. It is reported that for the civil part of the case, Qiu will pay 1,900 yuan, settling the case.</p>

He himself had suffered from an eye ailment, losing his sight and nearly losing his life, but was protected by the Bodhisattva and regained his health. Out of gratitude for the Bodhisattva's profound kindness, he had taken refuge in the Three Jewels ten years prior and vowed to uphold six vows: 1. To promote the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; 2. To repent for the sins of body, speech, and mind; 3. To broadly relieve the suffering of all beings; 4. To universally encourage reciting the Buddha's name and releasing living creatures; 5. To advocate for a Buddhist utopian society; 6. To vow to ascend to the Pure Land together. He hoped that all members of the association would embody the Bodhisattva's great compassion and work to alleviate suffering, eliminate calamities, and pray for peace. Subsequently, officers for various departments were elected, and all officers took their oaths of office. Next, the charter of the preparatory office was approved. Layman Chen Dingyi then explained the procedures for soliciting founders and members. Finally, preparatory members gave free speeches, and the meeting adjourned after refreshments. The "Guanyin Salvation Collection," edited by Mr. Chen, has been published. The contents include exquisitely printed images of the Bodhisattva, the Panchen Lama, Wang Yiting, Huang Qinglan, inscriptions by prominent laymen, sacred sites of the Bodhisattva, sutras, Dharma sayings, records of releasing living creatures, stories of inspiration, and more. The last part includes the Guanyin Salvation Association's constitution, totaling over eighty pages and over one hundred thousand words. If every household has a copy, it can serve as a guide for the public to return to the right path and believe in Guanyin Bodhisattva. The association is currently distributing the collection free of charge in person. For mail requests, please include a five-cent postage stamp for delivery.</p>

Subsequently, Detective Pi reported the investigation process and presented the seized weapons as evidence. Questioned, Zhang Baishan stated that the hotel room was opened by his friend Li Deming, who asked him to come for noodles. After a while, Li said he was going out to buy cigarettes, and then Chinese and Western detectives arrived and arrested him. He knew nothing about the handgun. He asked for leniency.

<h3 id="e142">Exchange Industry Convenes Meeting to Discuss Supporting the Legal Tender <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Notifying Fellow Traders to Prevent the Outflow of Silver Dollars; Rectifying Exchange Rates to Ensure Citywide Uniformity</p>
<p>The Shanghai Exchange Industry Association received letters from various branch offices stating that, although copper coin exchange rates have been set in recent days, market fluctuations have been inconsistent. For example, on the day before yesterday (the 13th), the market rate reached 3,150 wen per dollar, causing significant losses for traders. Those unfamiliar with the situation accused the exchange industry of manipulating prices. In reality, the exchange industry exchanges silver and copper coins based on money market rates, earning only a small profit. On the afternoon of the 13th, an emergency meeting of executive and supervisory committee members and branch office directors and deputy directors was convened. Attendees included Shen Weiting, Chen Liangyu, Chen Ruilin, Xian Wenda, Mi Chuxin, Teng Zhixiang, Chen Zaiyue, and over twenty others. Chairman Shen Weiting reported on the situation and the need to prevent the outflow of silver dollars, as well as the need to rectify copper coin exchange rates. Chen Liangyu expressed his opinions, and after discussion, the following measures were decided: (1) Notify all traders that if they have silver dollars, they should exchange them for legal tender at the designated three banks to comply with the law and avoid private trading or hoarding for profit. (2) Regarding the exchange rates for silver and copper coins, a uniform method will be formulated and representatives will be sent to negotiate with relevant parties before further discussion. Other cases were also discussed. The meeting adjourned late in the evening. The notice is excerpted below: Notice: Previously, the government issued an order that all silver coins (i.e., silver dollars) would be discontinued from November 4th and must be exchanged for legal tender at the "Central," "China," and "Communications" Banks. This association has unanimously supported this policy. However, all traders who have silver dollars in stock or who have accumulated them through exchange should promptly exchange them for legal tender at the designated three banks to comply with the law and avoid private trading or hoarding for profit, which would be illegal. All traders are urged to pay attention and avoid mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Astronomer Discusses Reason for Consecutive Days of Gloomy Weather: Rain in Changsha and Nanchang, Low Pressure Passing East over Shanghai <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the consecutive days of gloomy weather, with the sky threatening rain but not actually raining, and the warm climate, which is unusual for early winter, has surprised many people. However, according to an astronomer, this weather is due to rain in the Changsha and Nanchang areas of Central China, and low pressure passing east over Shanghai. However, this low pressure is not considered excessively low. If the upper reaches of the Yangtze River clear up, or if the low pressure from Siberia moves south, the weather in the city will become clear and the climate will turn cold. Yesterday, the highest temperature before 3:30 PM was 66.2 degrees, and the lowest was 59.4 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 63.3 degrees and the lowest was 41.9 degrees. This year's temperature is warmer than last year.</p>

<p>Shanghai Fresh Fish Association and fish merchant representatives Du Yongsheng and Zhang Shenzhi cabled the Minister of Industry in Nanjing yesterday, stating that piracy is rampant in the fishing areas at the beginning of this winter season, requesting that the Fisheries Protection Office be ordered by telegram to borrow warships to transport funds and protect the seas to avoid neglect. The original cable is as follows: Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, Nanjing: Fresh fish boats have borrowed warships from the Fisheries Protection Office during each fishing season to transport funds and protect the seas, as previously handled. Piracy is especially rampant this winter. Please order the Fisheries Protection Office by telegram to continue to handle the case, allocate funds for patrols, and avoid neglect. Respectfully submitted, Du Yong, Zhang Shenzhi, Representatives of Shanghai Fresh Fish Association and Fish Merchants, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Rickshaw Carts Not Subject to Quantity Restrictions <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>At a board meeting of the Public Concession Bureau the day before yesterday, the issue of rickshaw carts was discussed in detail. It was generally agreed that the management of these heavy-load vehicles, which are pushed and pulled by manpower, involves two major considerations: first, whether the operation of these vehicles obstructs traffic; and second, what impact they have on the smoothness of the road surface. These issues had been discussed in detail by various departments of the Public Concession Bureau and submitted to the Police Preparedness Committee for review. The two departments most closely related to this matter are the Engineering Department and the Police Department. The Engineering Department proposed that, in order to maintain the smoothness of the road surface, these vehicles should be equipped with certain types of wheels. The Police Department proposed that the number of vehicles should be restricted and that rickshaw carts should not be allowed to operate on certain roads. After discussion, the Police Preparedness Committee stated that, regarding the obstruction of traffic, the number of these manpower-pushed cargo vehicles has been increasing since 1925. If this trend is not curbed, road congestion is inevitable and should be restricted. However, one commissioner opposed this view, stating that restricting the number of vehicles would create a monopoly. The license fee should be used as a tool to manage the number of vehicles so that the current number does not continue to increase indefinitely. After detailed discussion, it was decided to recommend to the board of directors: (1) Do not restrict the number of vehicle licenses; (2) Add the following regulations to the Road Regulations: "The following locations are prohibited: Renmin Road, North Sichuan Road, Bazilu Road south of Sichuan Road, Sichuan Road, Waibaidu Bridge, etc."; (3) From July 1st next year, these vehicles must be equipped with 3.5-inch solid angle iron wheels or 2-inch solid rubber tires; (4) There will be no rewards or penalties for the installation of the above-mentioned wheels and tires; (5) The existing regulations on the number of loads will not be changed for the time being. It is reported that the above-mentioned measures have been accepted and implemented by the board of directors.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Young Man and Woman Jump into the River, One Dies, One Survives <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Didi Forcibly Pulled Her to Her Death, Zhao Juhong Said</p>
<p>At 11:15 PM the night before last, a young man and woman suddenly arrived at the Guangxing Road pier in Yangshupu and hired sampan boat No. 624, driven by Ge Zhipin, to cross the river, stating that they wanted to go to the Hefeng Factory pier in Pudong. The man and woman boarded the boat hand in hand, behaving intimately. Unexpectedly, when they reached the middle of the river (next to buoy No. 25), the man and woman jumped into the river to commit suicide. Ge Zhipin was shocked and quickly stopped rowing and tried to rescue them. He managed to pull the woman up, who was fortunate to survive, but the man disappeared, presumably joining the water spirits. Ge Zhipin then took the woman to the water patrol police station. According to the report, after the man and woman got on the boat, I intended to lower the awning to avoid the wind and rain because it was raining, but the male passenger blocked me, saying that it was not necessary to lower it and urged me to row quickly. When we were about halfway across the river, the man and woman stood up, and I vaguely saw the male passenger push the female passenger to stand on the flat baseboard at the bow of the boat. The female passenger seemed unwilling. Unexpectedly, the female passenger stepped onto the flat baseboard with her left foot, and the male passenger fell into the river from the middle of the boat, dragging the female passenger down with him. I saw this and immediately tried to rescue them, only managing to rescue the female passenger. The male passenger had already disappeared. The police chief questioned the woman, who stated that her name was Zhao Juhong, 19 years old, from Changzhou, and lived at No. 187 Huaxingfang, Yangshupu. She had parents at home and had been betrothed to someone, but had not yet married. She left home tonight to chat with her sisters. When she walked to Shunxing Street, Yangshupu, she met a man surnamed Mou, who worked as a clerk in a yarn factory. He asked me if I was working, and I replied that I wasn't, but I had been beaten and insulted by his wife, so I was reasoning with him. Because it was raining, we went to the pier to avoid the rain. Later, he called for a sampan boat to cross the river, and he forced me to jump into the river. I didn't want to, but I was eventually dragged down. Fortunately, I was rescued. The police chief believed that the woman was still unwilling to reveal the man's name, so it was impossible to investigate thoroughly. However, the deceased's residence was presumably not far away. He then ordered Detective Liang Shenqing to find out that the deceased's name was Zhou Didi, 25 years old, from Shanghai, who worked in the electricity room of the Tongxing Yarn Factory in Yangshupu. He lived in the factory's workshop at No. 119 Shunxing Street. Detective Liang then summoned the deceased's wife, Zhou Li (23 years old, from Yancheng), and Zhao Juhong's mother, Zhao Xuan, to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, he prepared a document and ordered Detective Liang to transfer Zhao Juhong, along with sampan boat owner Ge Zhipin, Zhou Li, Zhao Xuan, and others, to the prosecutor's office of the local court for review.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Testimony of Hao Zhongyang in the Case of the Strange Female Corpse <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Qiao Qishi Claims She Does Not Recognize the Witness; Judge Schedules On-Site Investigation Today</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on August 3rd of this year, when the Beiyang-class Shengjing steamship docked at Pier No. 3 of Taikoo Dock in the French Concession was departing, the turning propeller stirred up a strange female corpse in the river. At that time, Maiwoman Zhang Zhou identified the corpse as her niece, Zhang Jinlin (48 years old). Her lower body was unclothed, indicating that she had been murdered. The court dispatched police to arrest a woman named Qiao Qishi. After clear interrogation by Prosecutor Xie Lian, the defendant Qiao Qishi was charged with Article 271, Section 1 of the Criminal Law for joint murder, although she refused to confess to the joint killing. However, according to witness testimony, the details were vivid. The criminal court had previously held a public trial that was not concluded. Details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Judge Yang Xiangzu specially opened the Thirteenth Court to continue the trial. The defendant Qiao Qishi hired attorney Fang Junjie to appear in court to defend her. After the judge took the bench, he first brought the imprisoned Qiao Qishi and the plaintiff Zhang Zhou to the case and questioned them briefly. Then, he summoned witness Hao Zhongyang to the stand. He stated that he was 30 years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 9 Diandang Lane, Pudong, and worked as a dock laborer. At around 10:00 PM on August 2nd of this year, I was enjoying the cool air on the Taikoo Dock and saw a yellow car parked there. Two men, three women, and a child were sitting in it. After getting out of the car, the two men walked in front, with the deceased and her (pointing to Qiao Qishi) walking behind. Later, they sat on the dockside eating watermelon seeds (sitting around talking and laughing). I didn't think much of it. Later, I saw a man take off the deceased's pants. I guessed they were doing something improper. I thought it was bad luck and went to sleep. About 1:45 later, I suddenly heard a splash in the river and realized that they had pushed a woman into the river. I wanted to help, but a man with a black mole on his face and a dragon tattoo on his arm slapped me once and punched me twice. I fell to the ground. When I got up, they had all run away. When the corpse was found the next day, I said that the corpse was murdered and thrown into the river last night, so I was called to be a witness. Questioned by the judge, Qiao Qishi claimed that she rarely went out and did not recognize the witness, claiming she had been framed. She asked for leniency. The judge considered that the circumstances of the case were serious and required further on-site investigation. He scheduled to personally visit the Taikoo Dock to conduct an investigation at 9:00 AM the next day (today) and instructed the witness to come to the court at that time and demonstrate what happened at the scene. The witness complied with the order. The judge then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Wang Changlin Accused by Adoptive Mother <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Lawsuit over Mother-Son Identity; Official Urges Out-of-Court Settlement</p>
<p>Madam Wang Shi, a resident, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court against her adopted son, Wang Changlin, currently a staff member of a certain bank, to confirm their mother-son relationship, request payment of alimony, and recover past debts. She detailed that when the defendant was young, she nurtured him, intentionally cultivating him during his school years, and even took care of the clothing and food of his biological mother and sisters, with the money spent being difficult to quantify. Consequently, her husband's inheritance was almost entirely used up. Originally, she hoped that the defendant would return after completing his studies, and they could rely on each other as mother and son. Unexpectedly, after he gained social status and became an assistant manager at a bank, with a rich monthly income, he became wealthy and his attitude changed drastically, abandoning her and indifferently watching his over sixty-year-old mother, whose life was like a flickering candle, suffer from cold and hunger. She requested confirmation of the existence of their mother-son relationship, an order for the defendant to pay alimony of one hundred yuan per month, and reimbursement of five thousand yuan for previous educational expenses. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Yuhai opened a court hearing. The plaintiff, Wang Shi, was sixty-three years old, appearing old and frail, with a hunched back, and entered the courtroom, tremblingly stating the facts of the lawsuit. When she reached the most heartbreaking parts, she burst into tears and choked with sobs. The defendant, Wang Changlin, did not appear in person, but was represented by a lawyer who admitted that he had been adopted by the plaintiff as her son in the past, but claimed that this had been canceled later, and there was a written agreement, so the mother-son relationship no longer existed. He requested that the lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Zhang believed that the plaintiff and defendant belonged to different generations and should not be involved in litigation for so long, which would only increase animosity. He instructed them to try to reach a settlement outside of court. The case was adjourned until December 5th for further examination.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Gu Zhuxuan's Appeal Has Been Lodged; The Trial Date Should Not Be Far Off <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage, was accused by Zhao Guangfu, the former manager of the Great World amusement center, in the case of Tang Jiapeng's murder, of instigating the killing. He was arrested by the police and sent to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. After the trial concluded, Gu Zhuxuan was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for instigating murder, with ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Because Gu did not accept the verdict, he submitted a petition to the original court, declaring an appeal. The Second Special Court compiled the case files and submitted them to the higher Third Branch Court for review. He also submitted a supplementary appeal statement, the details of which have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Gu Zhuxuan has hired lawyers Shan Yuhua and Wu Qilun to draft an appeal statement, stating ten reasons for disagreeing with the original verdict, totaling several thousand words. The draft has been completed, and the formal lawsuit, using more than ten sheets of paper, has been bound into a thick volume. Yesterday, family members took it to the detention center to request a meeting. After the center issued a permit, they went to Guangci Hospital to have Gu Zhuxuan sign and seal the lawsuit. Then, it was submitted to the Third Branch Court. His defense lawyers also submitted a request to review the case files. After the High Court receives the statement and reviews the case files, the trial date is expected to be not far off. Furthermore, the family of the victim, Tang Youmei, has filed a civil lawsuit against Gu Zhuxuan for compensation. According to the representing lawyer, although the amount of compensation requested has been calculated to be over 30,000 yuan, it is said that the formal lawsuit has not yet been submitted.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Water Dispute in Jingsui Alley; Tenants and Landlords Involved in Lawsuit <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The houses in the Jingsui Alley area of Songpan Road in Eastern Shanghai are owned by Sun Hechai. Li Hainan, a tenant from Jiangbei, operates a public bathhouse ("tiger stove") in the alley. Because Li was suspected of privately burying water pipes underground to steal water, Sun reported him to the Yangshupu Police Station. The head detective sent officers to arrest him and bring him to the First Special Court for questioning. The judge instructed Li to post bail and adjourned the hearing. Judge Zhan Liangce personally inspected the area the afternoon before last to investigate the matter. It is now known that Li Liangnan has also hired lawyer Jia Yaoxi to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing landlord Sun Hechai of false accusation and disrupting the water supply, thereby disturbing the peace. The reason given is that Li rents Sun's house to operate a tiger stove, paying a monthly rent of twenty yuan, including the water supply. Because Li sells hot water, he also pays an additional fifteen yuan for water each month. However, starting in February of last year, Li, in order to save on water expenses, directly installed a water meter with the water company and paid according to the meter reading. At the same time, he stopped paying the additional fifteen yuan. The defendant, Sun Hechai, should provide the tenants in Li's building with the water supply they are entitled to. Unexpectedly, recently, all the tenants in Jingsui Alley, due to the poor economy, demanded that Sun reduce the rent and refused to pay it, which angered Sun. On the first of this month, he falsely accused Li Hainan of stealing water at the police station. The police arrested and interrogated Li, who was later released on bail. Furthermore, the next day, Sun, accompanied by workers, suddenly arrived at Li's place and removed the water pipes, including those for the rent, cutting off the water supply. This violates Articles 169 and 304 of the Criminal Law and should be investigated according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened a court hearing for this case. The defendant, Sun Hechai, arrived with lawyer Lang Peng to defend him. The court adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>

<p>Shi Lijuan, a dancer from Yixing at the Vienna Dance Hall, previously hired a lawyer at the First Special District Court to sue Fang Jiaheng, the owner of the Damao Rice Store on Wuzhen Road Bridge, for enticement and abandonment. Because he has repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned, the case has been pending for half a year and has not yet been concluded. Shi has now learned that Fang resides at No. 16, Zhengde Lane, South Chengdu Road, and has again requested the court to issue a summons. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court of the Special Court continued the hearing. Fang Jiaheng still did not appear. According to Judge Feng, when the bailiffs went to No. 16, Zhengde Lane, South Chengdu Road, to summon the defendant, it was claimed that the place was Fang Jiazhen's residence, and the defendant did not live there, so the summons could not be delivered. Shi Lijuan and her representing lawyer stated that the defendant has four brothers, Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen, who all live in Zhengde Lane, and the plaintiff has recently seen him. Furthermore, the Damao Rice Store on Wuzhen Road has now been renamed Yuanmao Rice Store, and an investigation by the plaintiff with the rice merchants' association revealed that it is still operated by the defendant. The plaintiff also stated that she is currently six or seven months behind on her rent and is in a difficult financial situation. She requested that the court strictly arrest the defendant and bring him to court for questioning. Judge Feng reviewed the report and ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing, instructing Shi Lijuan to accompany the bailiffs to identify Fang Jiaheng for arrest.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Gold Price Soars, Increasing Costs; Woolen Goods, Records, and Other Industries Raise Prices <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Woolen Industry to Implement Price Hikes Tomorrow; Record Prices to Increase on [Next] Month's [First] Day</p>
<p>Since the gold price has soared, the cost of imported raw materials has risen sharply due to the shrinking foreign exchange rate. Therefore, industries such as bakeries in this city have already implemented price increases to maintain their capital. Now, the cotton and woolen textile industry and record companies such as Great Wall Records have also announced price increases. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Gloves</p>
<p>The four factories in this city—Zhongnan, Meifeng, Dechang, and Fanlong—jointly issued a statement regarding the price increase of leather gloves, stating: "We hereby inform you that this year's prices were already low. Now, due to the soaring cost of raw materials, which has increased by more than 30%, our industry has decided to increase the old prices by one cost, starting from November 15th, to maintain our capital." (The rest omitted)</p>
<p>Woolen</p>
<p>Zhongnan Cotton and Woolen Textile Factory issued a notice stating: "Since the government order that national currency be based on silver and legal tender be circulated, the soaring cost of various raw materials has been unexpected. As a result, the prices of our factory's products, originally set, can no longer be sustained. To maintain our capital and slightly compensate for losses, we have decided to increase the prices of various woolen sweaters, vests, and scarves by 10% starting from November 15th." (The rest omitted) Huarong Woolen Factory also issued a similar notice.</p>
<p>Records</p>
<p>Great Wall Record Company issued a notice stating: "The Great Wall records issued by our company are manufactured in Germany. Payments to the factory are settled in British pounds. Recently, due to the shrinking foreign exchange rate, the cost has risen sharply. To maintain our capital, we have no choice but to moderately increase the selling price. We have now decided to increase the price by 20 cents (Chinese currency) per record starting from December 1st. Whether it is door-to-door sales, existing orders, or wholesale, the price will be increased uniformly. For remote provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, the implementation will be extended to December 16th."</p>

<p>The Municipal Police Bureau previously considered that the employment agencies (i.e., "reed head shops") in this city were of mixed quality, leading to illegal acts such as kidnapping and selling women, which was extremely regrettable. Therefore, starting last month, it began to rectify them. Each branch bureau reported the number of employment agencies within its jurisdiction to the bureau for preparation for dispatching investigators. The total number of employment agencies reported by each branch bureau is now two hundred. In addition to ordering the few branch bureaus that have not yet reported to do so quickly, the Municipal Police Bureau originally planned to start the review work on the first of this month. However, due to incomplete reporting procedures, it has been slightly delayed. It is now planning to dispatch personnel to conduct investigations with the police of each branch bureau. This will begin in the coming days. Illegal and reckless employment agencies will be severely cracked down on. To protect legally established agencies, registration of employment agencies will be held starting on the first of next month. Those who are approved for registration can continue to operate; those who are not approved will be ordered to cease operations.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Ningbo Industrial Bank temporarily suspended receipt and payment due to market fluctuations, it was revived by giants from Ningbo, such as Chu Qiqing and Chen Zhonggao, who initiated the organization of a preparatory office. Since the resumption of business, it has received the sympathy of various depositors, and various procedures have been put in order. It has also reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval, which ordered it to first return 20% of the savings deposits in cash according to the proportion of total depositors. It is now known that the revival preparatory office began to verify and issue payments on the 10th of this month. However, due to the large number of depositors, in order to avoid chaotic procedures, the office decided to handle it in batches. The first batch will be paid to depositors with deposits of 100 yuan or less. Therefore, depositors have flocked to the office to receive payments in recent days. There are also many whose addresses are unknown and whose original letters have been returned. Depositors with deposits of more than 100 yuan who have not received a payment notice from the office must bring their deposit certificates and seals to the preparatory office within five days to negotiate the verification and issuance of payment. After the first batch is completed, the second batch of depositors with deposits of 500 yuan or less will be issued immediately. The office will send another letter to notify each depositor to wait. It is said that debtors of the office are using various fine furs, fashionable silk clothes, and steel thermos bottles, etc., to repay their debts. These items are displayed inside the office, and depositors can purchase them without a certificate. Relatives and friends of depositors are also allowed to purchase them. In addition to the discounted prices, there will be an additional 50% discount.</p>

<p>The Engineering Committee of the Public Works Bureau recently proposed to the board of directors that the plan to widen Weihaiwei Road from Tongfu Road to Muer Ming Road be slightly changed in order to save money. The original plan for widening the road was to follow a straight line. Now, it is proposed to make a slight curve to the west of Tongfu Road, which will not hinder vehicle traffic, but can save more than 13,000 yuan in land compensation. Furthermore, the land on the north side of the road that is not needed can still be sold after dredging. It is said that the board of directors of the Public Works Bureau has accepted this proposal.</p>

Special wards have been opened to provide general addicts with a place to quit their addiction. The fees are low and charitable in nature.

<h3 id="e172">The Path to Political System Reform (Continued) <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>(Shanghai, November of the 24th Year)</p>
<p>—Respectfully Dedicated to the Comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Gentlemen Who Like to Discuss Political System Reform—</p>
<p>Fourth, even if the national crisis is entirely due to the Kuomintang's grasp of political power, "Party Rule" and "Tutelage Politics" should not be held solely responsible as the primary culprits. Because, realistically speaking, in the past few years, we have faced the covetous gaze of powerful neighbors, intensifying foreign troubles, rampant banditry, and pressing internal worries. If this is considered a failure of the Kuomintang, it is more accurately a failure of "one party without governance" than a failure of "Party Rule," and a failure of "politics without tutelage" rather than a failure of "Tutelage Politics." Therefore, in my humble opinion, to save the nation from peril and reverse its unfortunate fate, spending all our energy on debating and pre-announcing a written constitution on paper is less effective than openly and honestly burying ourselves in hard work, starting from strengthening the internal unity of the Party and implementing its political program to achieve the practical effects of "Party Rule," and from preparing for local self-governance and cultivating the people's capabilities to achieve the goals of "Tutelage Politics." If the members of the Kuomintang Central Committee can consistently demonstrate a spirit of unity, as they did at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee, and work diligently together, the people will undoubtedly support them. If the Kuomintang's policies for enriching national strength and cultivating popular capabilities can consistently demonstrate decisive power, like the currency reform plan, the people will undoubtedly be happy to follow them. If the Kuomintang's local party branches can truly assist local governments in serving the people, establishing schools everywhere in the shortest possible time, enlightening the people, reviving rural areas, and providing disaster relief, so that the intelligence and wealth of the majority of the people increase, the people will undoubtedly be willing to accept this, and local self-governance will inevitably be achieved. If the people in all localities can govern themselves and support the central government and willingly follow its policies, then the whole nation, united in heart and mind, can naturally achieve the goal of saving the nation from peril. It is clear that to resolve the current national crisis, the Kuomintang in power simply needs to strive diligently, which can be done without blaming heaven or earth for the national crisis, and even less by following the crowd, losing self-confidence, and joining the chorus of self-criticism regarding the unsuitability of "Party Rule" and "Tutelage Politics."</p>
<p>Above, I have pointed out the errors in the theoretical basis of the political system reform theories advocated by those who oppose the Three Principles of the People, layer by layer. Readers may think that I am not advocating for political system reform, but that is not the case. While I do not believe that the political system is omnipotent and that national affairs can be revived simply by reforming the political system, I also believe that the political system is a product of experience, and that for every increment of experience, the political system should be improved to strive for "perfection." Moreover, the philosophy of "when things are exhausted, change occurs, and change leads to progress" can sometimes be applied to the political system. Therefore, to adapt to the current environment, seeking out the shortcomings of the current political system and striving for its improvement is naturally something we should support. However, I believe that reforming the current political system should keep two major principles in mind, which must be explained first: (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Lou Lizhai</p>
<p>—Central Chemical Glass Factory—</p>
<p>During the Qianlong era of the late Qing Dynasty, the central government invested hundreds of thousands of yuan to establish a glass factory in Boshan, Shandong, hiring British technicians to manufacture glass utensils. This was the beginning of China's glass industry. However, the factory's products were limited to snuff bottles for the idle and skylight tiles for buildings, failing to meet the needs of the general public, leading to business failure and closure due to losses. At that time, the dismissed workers, forced by livelihood, used their skills and experience to manufacture some glass utensils at home. However, their intelligence was weak, and they lacked sufficient capital. Regarding manufacturing equipment and technology, they could only adhere to established methods and could not improve them. Therefore, to this day, their descendants can only make paperweights and other materials.</p>
<p>In recent years, the glass industry, like other industries, has made considerable progress. There are glass factories in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Changsha, Suqian, Tangshan, and other places. In terms of quantity, it cannot be considered small. However, there are not many products that can compete with foreign goods, and even fewer that can produce glass for chemical and optical applications. The Central Chemical Glass Factory in Shanghai specializes in chemical glass. Most of the various glass utensils produced by the factory are for chemical and medical use. Although the factory has not been in operation for long and is not large in scale, its products have been certified by the Shanghai Industrial Testing Institute as being of excellent quality and suitable for scientific experiments.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of October 16th, a group of three of us took the museum's car, departed from the museum, passed Tilanqiao, entered Pingliang Road, and drove to the intersection of Ningguo Road, where we got out in front of the factory gate. After being announced, we were greeted by Mr. Xu Xinzhi, the manager, and Mr. Wang Zhengxi, the factory director. They were both wearing very plain clothes, especially Mr. Wang, who was wearing a very dirty blue cloth shirt and trousers. Seeing these very dirty clothes, we could imagine the scene of Mr. Wang directing the workers and burying himself in hard work.</p>
<p>The two gentlemen received us very diligently. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they led us to visit the various sections.</p>
<p>A glass factory is different from ordinary factories in that all products must be produced from the furnace. The raw materials in the furnace must first be mixed and stirred by the engineer, and then placed in crucibles and sent into the furnace to burn ten hours in advance. Therefore, they first led us to visit the raw material room.</p>
<p>The important raw materials for glass are quartz powder and fluorite powder. In the raw material room, in addition to a lot of these things piled up separately, there were also piles of pre-mixed raw materials, ready to be sent into the furnace to burn.</p>
<p>We walked out of the raw material room and went to the furnace room, where we saw many workers surrounding the blood-red furnace, doing different work. Some people took some molten glass material that had been burned blood-red from the crucible with a hollow iron rod, blew on it, shook it a few times, and then put it in an iron mold and blew on it. After a while, they took it out, and it formed a utensil. Some people were making high-footed wine glasses and various hot water cups, and some people were pulling glass tubes, pulling them very long, and then cutting them to the required length. Behind the furnace room, there were three large drying rooms, which were specially used for tempering the finished utensils. Because the temperature of the utensils made from the raw materials taken from the furnace is very high, it must be allowed to cool down slowly. Therefore, some workers were sending the newly made utensils into the drying room. All finished utensils can be taken out after spending twenty-four hours in the drying room for further work.</p>
<p>After we finished watching the situation in the furnace room, Mr. Xu and Mr. Wang led us to the engraving room, where we saw many machines lined up, and many workers surrounding the machines doing various different jobs. Some were engraving very fine patterns on glass cups, and some were polishing the mouths of glass cups.</p>
<p>Next, we went to the measuring instrument engraving room, where we saw two or three workers engraving ten cc measuring cylinders and one cc droppers with one hundred graduations on the machines. This kind of work is very precise. Next to the measuring instrument engraving room was the gas workshop, where many workers were making condenser tubes and the mouths of measuring flasks. According to Mr. Xu and Mr. Wang, this kind of craft is very difficult to do, so the workers in this section are paid very well, with the highest salary reaching 180 yuan per month, which is much higher than the salaries of the manager and the factory director.</p>
<p>Finally, the two gentlemen also led us to the packaging room to see the packaging situation.</p>
<p>After we finished watching the production process, Mr. Xu told us that the factory was initiated by several people who loved science. Preparations began in September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), and it was established in July of the 23rd year (1934), with a capital of 50,000 yuan. The target of the business is the academic and medical community, and household utensils are not particularly emphasized. From the opening to the end of last year, the turnover reached more than 100,000 yuan in half a year. Since this year, the business has made great progress, and 70% of the universities in the country have adopted the factory's products.</p>
<p>After listening to these words, we deeply feel that in today's era when the Chinese people are vigorously promoting science, it is a blessing for China that the Chinese people can manufacture their own scientific instruments to promote China's science. We hope that the scientific community can adopt them more to develop China's science. Note: (There are a few words to add from the "Overview of Shanghai's Textile Industry" edited by the China Credit Information Institute) According to Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, since the shutdown last winter, it has repeatedly sought to resume operations. At the beginning of last month, Du Yuesheng and others rose up to organize the Textile Industry Banking Group to actively assist. It has already started work on the 23rd of the same month.</p>

<p>Later the doctor came, and the poor hero went through a hard struggle, because some small bones in his foot were injured, and fixing them was still a painful thing. So Don's lips turned white, and beads of sweat rested on his forehead, but he never cried out, just clutched Mrs. Joe's hand, so it was still red after a long time.</p>
<p>"You have to keep this child very quiet, at least for a week, don't let him put his foot on the ground. By then I can know if he can try hopping along with a cane, or if he needs to rest longer," said the doctor, as he put away the shiny knives and clamps, which Don didn't like to see either.</p>
<p>Don was startled to hear the word crutches, and quickly asked, "Will he get better someday, won't he?"</p>
<p>"Hopefully," said the doctor, and left. Don felt very depressed, because losing a foot was a terrible disaster from the perspective of a lively child.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'm a famous nurse, we'll have you walking as usual in a month," said Mrs. Joe, who took an optimistic view of the matter.</p>
<p>But the fear of lifelong disability haunted Don's dreams, and even Tenty's comfort was not enough to lift his spirits; so Mrs. Joe suggested that a few children come in to visit, and asked him which ones he would like to see.</p>
<p>"Ned and Joe; I also love my hat, and there are some things inside that I think they'd like to see too. I guess you threw away my bag of loot?" said Don, his face suddenly anxious when he asked the question.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Finance: The Chips Loosen, the Expiration Nears; the Standard Gold Price Plunges Sharply <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Hedgers Heavily Short; Major Buyers' Interest Wanes; Floating Long Positions Waver; Final Drop of Six Yuan and Three Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market has been peaceful for several days, but yesterday there was a slight decline, mainly because large holders had already cut their long positions, and Chinese merchants were arbitraging U.S. dollars, loosening the chips. The expiration date is pressing, and the long side is easily shaken. According to morning reports from overseas silver markets, both British and American markets were flat. The forward silver prices in Monterrey varied. Exchange rates were slightly long. London refined gold rose two pence. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both British and American rates flat. The Customs Gold Unit rose four li. The standard gold price was posted at a premium of 1149 yuan and 3 jiao. However, market sentiment did not improve. The market opened slightly lower in the morning. After the opening, major holders and banks offered gold together, and the price declined. However, buyers were still active, and the price rebounded slightly. It was anticipated that the HSBC exchange rate would be announced, with the British rate flat and the American rate up by .0625. Afterward, banks continued to sell and major holders continued to sell bullion, eventually leading to a decline. However, the market was peaceful, and fluctuations were limited. The Bank of Japan squared its sterling position, and the situation stabilized slightly after the initial decline. The silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Although the Hong Kong market did not appear favorable, the demand was scarce, leaving no room for activity. It was predicted that Indian silver would remain unchanged. Banks traded amongst themselves, making the market even more idle and seemingly stable. The market was quieter at noon. In the afternoon, due to tight exchange rates, the market showed signs of firmness. Major holders took advantage of the high price to sell bullion, and banks seized the opportunity to sell, preventing further gains. Although the Hong Kong market was firm, Indian silver was reported flat. The overall situation stabilized, with little fluctuation. Indian silver remained flat in the second report. Major holders supplied gold, causing a slight decline, but the price still hovered. The supply side became more active, but there was a lack of buyers. At two o'clock, sellers gathered, and rumors spread, causing a sudden drop to 1142 yuan. Exchange rates were peaceful, and there were many who bought to cover at the lower price, making it easy to push the price up. The market ultimately remained indecisive, mainly because unfounded rumors spooked the gold market, and the long side was pressured by the impending expiration date, making it easily shaken. Today will begin the December expiration rollover date. It is predicted beforehand that the short side will offer around ten yuan. The day's market situation is recorded as follows:</p>

Although the Hong Kong market was loose, Hongxing Yong entered, rising from 6 yuan and 9 jiao to 7 yuan and 3 jiao. Tongfeng Heng and others still had supplies. It was predicted that Indian silver would remain unchanged, leading to stagnation. After hovering, the noon close was 1147 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1147 yuan and 1 jiao. Yifeng Yong Dadecheng Yuansheng Yong accepted bullion, rising to 7 jiao and 9 fen. October U.S. dollars at 3.75 had no sellers.

Macgarry needed January U.S. dollars at 1.25. Yifeng Yong Huiyuan accepted, rising to 7 yuan and 8 jiao. Tongfeng Heng Yicheng and others continued to supply, gradually falling to 7 yuan. The initial report for Indian silver was unchanged. At this time, Yuanmao Yong took advantage of the low price to accept, hovering. Hengyu Xianghe Dingkang Chunyuan Yong and others successively sold bullion. The second report for Indian silver still showed no change. Due to a lack of support, the market gradually weakened, falling to 6 yuan. Hengchang Yong and Yicheng accepted, rising to 6 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengyu Fuxing Yong Yuanmao Yong Fuyu Richang and small-scale longs, as well as Dadecheng Tongfu, all sold. For a time, selling pressure was urgent, falling to 1 yuan.

Dadecheng Yongli continued to sell, falling to 1 yuan and 9 jiao. Yingxiang Fuxing Yong entered up to 3 yuan and 2 jiao. Tongfu continued to sell, and the closing price fell to 1142 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, was posted at a premium of 1149 yuan and 3 jiao. Based on the closing price, it was about 7 yuan weaker. Compared to the previous close, it was 8 yuan weaker. The registration price for this month was 1137 yuan, and for December, 1147 yuan. The morning supplemental payment was 137 yuan, and the afternoon supplemental payment was 1133 yuan. The price of pure gold was reduced by 3 yuan, to 1145 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were priced 5 yuan and 5 jiao higher but lacked transactions. Refined gold was priced 6 to 6 yuan and 5 jiao higher and was purchased for about 300 taels by Yingfeng Heng and Dadecheng. It was sold by the silverware shops. It is predicted that for the upcoming December rollover to January period, the short side will offer around 8 to 10 yuan. This will depend on the strength of both the long and short sides.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still peaceful. Generally, Tongfeng Heng Yuqing Yong Dadecheng Yingfeng Heng Huixiang Tongfu, etc., were on the selling side. Shenfeng Hengyu Chunyuan Yong Zhentai Hongxing Yong Yuanmao, Yong Hengchang Yong Qianchang Xiang Yifeng Yong Yuxin Xiang Chengfeng Yong Yingwan Heng Hengxing, etc., were on the buying side. Hengyu Chunyuan Yong Fuyu Dingkang bought first and sold later. Fuxing Yong Yicheng sold first and bought later. Dalian businesses Wanxing Shunli still had little impact. Guangdong businesses were generally quiet. Hengxing bought slightly less than 100.</p>
<p>The day's market situation appeared quite weak. The morning opening was 1148 yuan, and the final close was 1142 yuan and 6 jiao. The highest price was 1148 yuan and 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 1141 yuan, a fluctuation of 7 yuan and 5 jiao. The result was a drop of 6 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous close.

<p>Near-Term Breaks the 90 Yuan Level</p>
<p>The opening of the labeled yarn market was uniformly downward, and the decline was more intense. There were too many rumors, and people were panicked. There was a strong bearish atmosphere in the market. However, the major long positions did not relax. The demand for spot yarn was remarkably weak, so the near-term price declined further, breaking through the 190-yuan level. The far-term was dragged into a sluggish state. As a result, each month fell by 1.1 to 2.6 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was still quiet. Gaining positions made slight increases in the third trade. By the time of the closing, it was heard that the spot yarn sales volume was only over 300 bales. The market situation was still weak.

<p>The cotton market was still sluggish. The US cotton, which had been rising for days, was calm. The standard gold price was stable, and market sentiment was soft. The major long positions took profits in large quantities. Changfeng also closed out, and the floor became somewhat relaxed. However, Tongji remained unmoved. Xincheng continued to buy and increase its holdings. The amount was accumulating more and more, so the trend of the cotton market was more expensive than the yarn market.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Runkang Shorts</p>
<p>The labeled cotton market opened with the US cotton price increases having subsided, but the Indian cotton was still up by 1.75 rupees. The yarn market gradually declined, causing a slight blow to the cotton market. The bearish atmosphere in the market was particularly strong.

The number of chips on the market decreased, and all months fell by 4.5 jiao. The Xincheng long positions continued to pull in the market and rebound during the second and third sales.

However, the rise began again in the second sale. The market was flat in the third sale. There was not much change in the closing, but the situation turned firm.

<p>In the morning flour market opening, following the previous day's downward trend and with foreign wheat quoted, prices continued to drop by three or four cents, dampening sentiment. Many bulls rushed to sell, causing prices for all months to drop by three or four points immediately. Trading was still brisk, estimated at six to seven hundred thousand bags. Midway, due to short covering, prices rebounded by one point. However, in the afternoon opening, sentiment remained weak due to renewed rumors of instability in the north. Actual sales in the market were not active, so bulls unloaded smoothly, and prices showed no signs of recovery. Regarding the current situation of foreign wheat, foreign firms reportedly have indicated that there is still a large supply of old Australian wheat and that new harvests are also strong, allowing for future exports. Therefore, there was a quoted price of $6.50 on the market, but whether this is accurate remains to be seen.</p>

<p>April Futures 3.1300 3.0775 Down 0.0725</p>
<p>In the morning wheat market opening, due to foreign wheat quotations, both Chicago and Canada saw declines of about three or four cents. Most buying and selling, both inside and outside the industry, was related to financial considerations, with little activity. Therefore, trading was minimal, and the market was sluggish, falling three or four points compared to the previous day. In the afternoon opening, the flour market's sharp decline and rumors of foreign wheat being offered for sale, along with renewed rumors of instability in the north, made bulls nervous, and they rushed to sell. Near and distant futures fell another three or four points. Industry insiders speculate that if foreign wheat becomes readily available, the market situation should ease. Spot wheat trading is still smooth. Customers, seeing the decline in flour and wheat, are hesitant to buy more. High-quality wheat is offered six or seven cents lower, with Kaimingguang wheat at $4.92, Shandong wheat at $4.93, Yaowan wheat at $4.90, Guandian wheat at $4.86, and Liuhe wheat at $4.84. Fuxin sold 3,000 bags, and Xinda sold 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Fujian Rice Initially Sold</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was little buying or selling of foreign rice. The entire market saw only 330 bags of Three Castles Western rice traded. The market’s existing reserves of foreign rice were already depleted, and new arrivals were not significant. Merchants had little stock and were reluctant to sell. The supply of guest rice was abundant, but local sales were sluggish, continuing the soft market trend. Sales to the northern merchants were even more stagnant yesterday, with only the local market being slightly active. The 1,600 bags of newly arrived Fuzhou rice from the previous day were sold, with Ji Wan at $9.90 and Ji Zao at $9.44, also handled by the local market. The local market also sold 1,300 bags of Ningbo rice, 2,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, and more than 800 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, with prices similar to the previous day but with slight variations.</p>

<p>—Unique Good Price Outside the Corner…Other Sales Stagnant and Weak—</p>
<p>(Yesterday, more than thirty shipments of various merchants from southern Shanghai arrived, totaling more than 6,000 dan.) Retail sales in the card room market continued to be sluggish, so the market situation changed again. The price of high-quality japonica rice dropped by several cents to about a dime. Duyang pointed rice also followed, dropping several cents. However, more than 2,000 bags of thin rice were purchased by Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai and other northern merchants, so the situation was particularly tight. It is expected to rise by one and a half dimes, and the price of goods in the central market is also good by about a dime. Yinbian Yuan went to the transformed road, falling by one or two dimes. Po Yan is still deserted. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were thirty-two or three shipments from various roads under the river. Due to the cloudy and rainy weather, there were few goods on the market from various stores, resulting in ordinary retail sales. The market price of japonica rice was a small dime, the price of thin rice was stable, and the price of early and late rice was slightly less than one dime. The price of Dujian and Yangbu pointed rice was slightly lower, with sporadic sales of guest pointed rice remaining stable, and the price was also soft. New Chen Bian Yuan's retail sales were slight, and the price of Chen Bian was stable. The price of New Bian Yuan was fatigued, and the prices of other goods were also soft.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, with stable customs gold, the public quoted the current price of No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar at $22.05, with slight transactions, an increase of one dime compared to (December 12).

<p>Recently, the price of dried Tong'an round longan has risen repeatedly due to the small amount of reserves in the production area. The market price in Shanghai has also risen accordingly. According to the information from the Qinzhou ship import yesterday, only a few pieces arrived. The quoted price for this number has increased again, and it is not known whether the future market will rise again.</p>

<p>Although the outflow of pig iron ingots has not been strong recently, there have still been some embellishments in sand-casting factories and machinery factories. Therefore, the standard market conditions were initially very peaceful. Recently, due to the surge in exchange rates, the cost has increased. The current price of No. 1 goods from Liuhegou is estimated at $68 per ton, No. 1 goods from India are estimated at $78, and No. 1 goods from Russia are estimated at $73, which is $2.00 to $3.00 better than before. It is said that only a small number of transactions have been made in recent days, but holders are unwilling to easily sell large quantities.</p>

<p>The highest price of 35-pound tinplate, a market price of $60, was opened yesterday. Because there are not many spot goods on the market and few arrivals, people are feeling particularly bullish. It is reported that cigarette factories and biscuit factories have been buying smoothly in recent days, but the market supply is insufficient, so the market price will not easily ease for a while.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market saw all European firms close down due to the thin stocks and lack of goods on the market. Only Xiehe Jinlong and other firms bought more than 180 boxes of Zhenmei green tea, and market prices remained stable. Currently, there are only more than 8,000 boxes of green tea from various sources on the market, which will likely be sold out within the year.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the rising price of woolen cloth, there is a disconnect between old and new goods in the piece goods market, and there is no standard market price. Some have risen by several cents or one or two dimes, some have risen by 10%, and some have soared by more than 10%, leaving buyers at a loss and even brokers unsure. The most popular and rising woolen goods are plain, thick broadcloth and two types of Biguang feather yarn, followed by overcoat cloth, Melton yellow cloth, and Chongzhi, followed by riding breeches, medium-thick serge, yellow Zhuang Qinghua Special cloth, double-sided yellow camel down, floral cotton cloth, French style lining, black charcoal lining, and horsehair sleeves. Chinese and Western style floral cloth, pullover fabric, raincoat cloth, Yuan Zhigong, plain serge, shoe cloth, etc., have the smallest increase.</p>

<p>— Fang Xun</p>
<p>In early September, the commercial theaters in Tokyo have already begun their autumn "battles." Among the many staged programs, the ones that are more attractive are the "Bride School," written by Kataoka Teppei, directed by Senda Koreya, and starring Mizutani Yaeko, which is being performed at the Meiji-za Theater; "Nata," written by Mafune Yutaka, directed by Kubota Mantaro, which is being performed at the Tokyo Theater; "Shunkinsho," written by Tanizaki Junichiro, directed by Tagomura Rokuro; "A Kesas no Ryo-nin," written by Kikuchi Kan, directed by Mizuki Kumio, which is being performed at the Yurakuza Theater; and "Koxinga's Battles," written by Osanai Kaoru, directed by Sonoike Kagyo and Aoyagi Nobuo. Because the other programs at the Meiji-za Theater were uninteresting, and I originally wanted to see "Shunkinsho" at the Tokyo Theater, but firstly, I could not get used to the male impersonating female tone of "New School Drama (Japanese civilization play)," and secondly, I was unwilling to sit for five or six hours in the air of "Takashimade" and "Momowari" (Note: names of old-style Japanese hairstyles). (Most of the audience of the New School Drama are people from the entertainment industry; just like in China, when famous actors appear on stage, there are strange shouts of applause from the audience, and the plays performed are limited to so-called human tragedy.) At the same time, I thought that Tanizaki's original work was staged on this occasion, it was already "the song of the Shu-uguisu bird" "not at the right time, not in the right place" (words of the protagonist Shunkin in the original work), so I only went to see "Koxinga's Battles," which was co-performed by the former Kabuki famous actor Sumizō and Natsukawa Shizue.</p>
<p>I think it is very interesting that this play is being staged at this time.</p>
<p>The story is taken from the late Ming Dynasty in China. "Si Zong's favored minister Li Taotian colluded with the Tartars, invaded China, and killed Si Zong in the forbidden palace. Grand Sima General Wu Sangui killed his own son to replace the young emperor, so he was spared from the disaster. The emperor's sister Zhantan, with the help of Wu Sangui's wife Liu Gejun, took a boat across the sea and arrived in Hirado, Japan, first. Zhi Long, a Ming minister, was trapped by traitors, and he went to Japan quickly, and he had already married and had children. The son's name is Wazanei (i.e., Zheng Chenggong). He is resourceful, brave and invincible. Seeing Zhantan coming, he knew that the Ming Dynasty had collapsed, so Zhi Long led his wife and children back to China, and sought to see Gan Qinghui's eldest daughter Jin Xiang, who was married to Zheng Chenggong. Tell Gan Hui to help Cheng Gong restore Ming Yin, Gan Hui also has the ambition to restore the country, but is unwilling to unite with the 'Japanese' Wazanei because of his wife and children. Jin Xiang then cut her abdomen to show her determination, and Wazanei's mother killed herself with a knife to prevent her son from having any worries. Wazanei then led the three armies to drive away the Tartars, restore the Ming Dynasty, and was named Koxinga, the Prince of Yanping, for his功."</p>
<p>This story is not Osanai's creation. Before him, similar structures had already appeared in "Joruri" and Chikamatsu Monzaemon's "Kabuki". Osanai's adaptation is roughly based on Chikamatsu's Kabuki. As far as the story is concerned, we already feel a bit absurd and unfounded, but we did not expect that Mr. Osanai, the founder of the Japanese New Drama Movement, would arrange the "Improved Kabuki" in such a mixed and chaotic manner. Mr. Osanai's performance technique originally originated from Stanislavsky's school, but he, who is usually so careful and meticulous, took such a big risk here! In addition to the original Kabuki and Gidayu of Japan, this play also uses Chinese musical accompaniment, Chinese opera fighting, and Acrobat. It is said that it also adopted the expression methods of fingers and movements from Mei Lanfang's Chinese opera. In the stage setting, it also explained Osanai's school of old realism and adopted an extremely simplified method. During the fighting, the stuntman uses the same somersault, tiger jump, but after a while, there is a Nanyang-style music. In the drama, I don't feel any inscription, and the spectacle is not necessarily brilliant, so why do you want to perform this kind of drama?</p>
<p>Let us now put aside whether the historical facts are true or not. First, according to the current performance, we feel that in addition to uglifying and 　forcing the power of the Chinese nation, there is no other significance. The most sympathetic and sanctified character in the play is Wazanei's mother (Japanese), and the most heroic character is Wazanei himself, who wears Japanese clothes. For example, in the scene of fighting a tiger in the bamboo forest (it is clear that this is from 　Yang　), it is not Wazanei's "human power" that conquers the big tiger, but the divine power of the Ise Great God's "amulet" (a kind of Mascot) given to him by his mother! For example, when Zheng Zhilong changed into Ming Dynasty clothes in a city building, the purpose was entirely to promote the Japanese woman's virtues and spirit of Wazanei's mother from the contrast in front of the full house of "Tang people"!</p>
<p>In addition to these commercial theaters, the performances of experimental theater troupes, such as the September performance of "Creation Theater" and the one-year anniversary performance of "New Association Theater", are mostly in the late month. I hope that the insomnia that erodes my body can be reduced a little, and perhaps I can report more energetic Tokyo theater news to the readers of this journal.</p>

<h3 id="e226">On the Road of New Poetry <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>Recently, I read an article by Mr. Chen Zizhan on the issue of new poetry, which is one of "Qu Lu's Poetry Talks" in "Yan Lin" of Li Bao. The main idea of ​​this article is: the current Chinese new poetry world is quite sluggish. "Many advanced new poets have put down their pens, undoubtedly admitting their failure. New poets have not found any new ways, and it is unwise to follow the old ways; therefore, Mr. Chen advises new poets to simply go back to the 'Hu Shi style' that has evolved from old poetry, and in the middle, he especially cited the 'Flying Small Praise', which seems like a small poem written by Hu Shi when he traveled to Guangxi, as the latest specimen of the so-called 'Hu Shi style'."</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Chen Zeng declared: "Naturally, it is not said that this is the only way"; but at least this is "a way", and it is "a way that new poets can take" that Mr. Chen does not hesitate to point out specially. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>At present, I feel that this kind of opinion is not very appropriate and worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>First of all, it must be pointed out that what Mr. Chen said is somewhat self-contradictory. He deeply believes that it is unwise for new poets not to find new ways and to follow the old ways; but at the same time, he advises new poets to take the "Hu Shi style" way. Is it possible that the "Hu Shi style" is not an "old way"? Is it possible that taking this "old way" counts as "　"?...</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of the history of the Chinese new poetry movement, everyone knows that as the first experimenter in writing new poetry, Hu Shi's works, due to the relationship between his era and his talent, can be said to be extremely immature, especially with the product of inseparable blood relationship with old poetry. If we compare them with the works of later writers, we cannot deny in terms of content or form that the later new poetry has undoubtedly gradually progressed to a higher stage. Unexpectedly, at this moment, Mr. Chen turned around and called on the new poets to go back and take Hu Shi's old road. I think this not only wipes out the achievements of the new poetry movement that has been painstakingly managed for more than ten years; moreover, to put it more seriously, it also inevitably has the suspicion of deliberately advising people to drive backwards!</p>
<p>I remember that Hu Shi, who was rich in years, once compared those "new critics" who had not been poisoned by old poetry to "little girls with natural feet" in the preface to the fourth edition of "Attempt Collection", saying that their creations "are bold in liberation and full of fresh meaning, which makes me happy and ashamed"; and he compared himself to a "woman who had her feet bound and then released", frankly admitting that his poems "still carry the bloody air of the foot-binding era". If his metaphor is still appropriate, then Mr. Chen Zizhan is no different from calling us "little girls with natural feet" to re-learn how to walk like a "woman who had her feet bound and then released", and to seep out some "bloody air of the foot-binding era" on our feet again!</p>
<p>It is true that the current Chinese new poetry world is quite sluggish. Although there are quite a few reasons for this, those who write poetry cannot but bear considerable responsibility. ——Literature and art (poetry is naturally no exception) is a reflection of reality. The more a work can correctly and profoundly reflect objective reality, the more meaningful and valuable it will be. However, in fact, there are quite a few in China today. Poets simply dare not or "disdain" to look reality in the eye with their "noble" eyes. They still sit high in the supreme ivory tower all day long: or they specialize in chanting about the wind and the moon, trying to put the moldy old wine into new bottles, or they hum some flowers, crows, girls, and seven-stringed guqin as usual, and they also claim to be what school and what school, deliberately making their texts mysterious, deliberately showing off their so-called "novel techniques", and writing many "beautiful" poems that "low-energy" readers do not understand. This is a phenomenon. In addition, there are also some poets who, although they have a correct worldview and ideology to a certain extent; but their lives are still lacking, their experiences are still insufficient, and their works are prone to being empty; or they have not grasped the most appropriate expression methods, and cannot "cash in" the specific theme into concrete images, so it is difficult to write satisfactory works. This is another phenomenon. —Our poets' activities are already in such a situation, so what's so strange about the sluggishness of the current new poetry world!</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that for today's Chinese new poets, the most important thing is to bravely face reality, and to enrich their lives as much as possible on the one hand, and to conquer brand-new techniques in creative activities on the other. Only in this way can we achieve greater achievements and open up a more open future for new poetry!</p>
<p>As for the "Hu Shi style", I think it is already a historical "antique", and it is definitely not a way, definitely not a way that our new poets should take at present.</p>

<p>— Yan Yilin</p>
<p>The writer Mary Coleridge, in an article entitled "The King Is Dead, Long Live The King", narrates a meaningful story: Once upon a time, there was a king who died when he was very young. He felt that it was not the time for him to die, not because he had a beautiful wife, but because he was such an excellent king during his lifetime. He worked day and night, selflessly planning for the welfare of all the people in his country; in addition, he had many good friends. He thought to himself that his wife, friends, and all the people in the country needed his resurrection. So he finally got the approval of heaven, allowing him to return to the world. If he could find three people who needed his resurrection within an hour, he would be able to live several more years in the world. He returned to the world, but was completely disappointed. Even his best friend during his lifetime threw his photo on the floor and burned his letters in the stove. His good friend had already gone to serve the new king. His beautiful wife was having a secret meeting with her lover. Everything was completely "beyond expectations". He then realized his stupidity and was willing to sleep sadly on the ground.</p>
<p>Mary Coleridge satirizes the erroneous mentality of people who think their existence is very important in this article. But I think this kind of psychological error is extremely beneficial. Because there is such an error lying in people's hearts, life has a profound meaning. Moreover, the progress of mankind is based on this point; otherwise, everyone will give up the idea of "self-importance", then the entire human race will sink into the twilight of death and become a self-defeating world; perhaps many people will therefore bid farewell to their lives and the world.</p>
<p>It is the most pleasant thing in the world when a person feels that he is needed by others or the world; and he will immediately feel a profound meaning in life. The so-called "love" is to feel that one is needed; ——especially the so-called "love". For those who have experience in this area, they should always remember that when they think of the fact that they are loved by a woman, an unspeakable pleasure suddenly floats in their chest, and they are proud of it. On the contrary, the greatest sadness and sorrow in the world is to discover that you have been abandoned: therefore, suicide after "losing love" is also a common occurrence.</p>
<p>However, are people really not needed by other people? You can get it if you think about it. I don't think it's all like the writer Mary Coleridge showed. If there is such a thing as "love" in the world, it can prove that his is not entirely right.</p>
<p>However, for those who have become the past, it is the law of nature to be forgotten.</p>

<p>— Long Gong</p>
<p>Once, I met two graduating normal school students, a man and a woman, who were a couple. In a suitable setting, we talked about happiness, future aspirations... things young men like to talk about. He spoke of his ideals in a full, sonorous voice.</p>
<p>"Our director of student affairs is also a strange character. He himself smokes opium, runs a sporting goods and stationery shop, and a small restaurant, and is busy all day long, yet he tells the students: 'My ideal is a lifelong revolution.'" Lifelong, how bizarre! ... He likes to bow to the students, and when he lectures them, he says, "Mr. Wang, please do this and that," or "Mr. Li, please do that and that." This fellow is lying.</p>
<p>"Principal Kong Xianren disagrees with the director of student affairs. He says: 'The citizens of a country are like ants in a nest. Magnified under a microscope, they all look different. I hope to be an honest and obedient citizen!' ... Mr. Yang Ruopeng's encouragement is correct, and so am I. — Have you dissected ants?'</p>
<p>"What will be the result of doing other things for life, or being a citizen for life? — They are all wrong, I say. If so, let's think about Guangdong ten years from now... at least five million illiterate, uncivilized children! A country without elementary school teachers! Everyone will become like — alas..."</p>
<p>"Let me talk about myself. I want to be a governor. The first thing I want to do is to raise the salaries of elementary school teachers, stipulate high rates of pay increases, give them the honor of lifetime employment, and insure their lives, illnesses, fires, floods, and war disasters, and announce preferential regulations for them in theaters, teahouses, and various public transportation services... My goal as governor is simple. In addition, I think I can confiscate all firearms from the people, and use this method to avoid dangerous incidents... I want to be like so-and-so in the past, able to walk on the road with only two followers. When people see me, they don't have to point behind my back and whisper, 'This is the governor,' they can walk up to me and say, 'Hello, Governor,' and they can bow or not as they please... In short, I still live my free life as a commoner..."</p>
<p>"But after I got together with her, I gradually changed. Now, I more firmly think that I really want to be an elementary school principal. An elementary school principal. — Easy to understand. She is my assistant, my 'cheering partner.' We... what did you say?"</p>
<p>The girl shrank her head, pouted her lips, squinted her eyes, and made a humming sound in this coy gesture, then she corrected him:</p>
<p>"You might as well honestly tell him that this is my ideal!"</p>
<p>"Okay. — It's the same thing. We only need sixty students. And we won't hire any other teachers... These sixty children are our children, our students, and also our masters. We all live in the school together... For the beauty of their bodies and the beauty of their spirits, there must be spacious school buildings, including a sports field, classrooms, a library, dormitories, a dining hall, a swimming pool, a courtyard, a hall... a small mountain, a small lake, a small river... everywhere is flowers, grass, and trees. Parents entrust their children to the two of us, this is complete trust. We want them to wear the same beautiful clothes, different only in their blue, brown, or black eyes. We want them to breathe civilization from an early age... You know how much those children will love this!"</p>
<p>Regarding the concerns of the people, I admit that he expressed very good opinions. Just as he chose a very good wife. The Chinese people really need beautiful things too much.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Pleasant Rain and Bitter Rain <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>My first essay, submitted to "Free Talk," was called "Rain in My Hometown." It has been more than two years since I wrote that article, but my mood seems to be the same as it was two years ago. Whenever I mention rain, I always feel that it is suitable for the countryside, not for the city, suitable for spring and autumn, not for winter and summer, suitable for dusk, not for daytime. However, this is only in general terms. If I were by the seaside, I would like summer storms.</p>
<p>This is because love and hate also have to change with the environment.</p>
<p>In fact, my love for spring rain, autumn rain, dusk, and rain in the countryside is also related to my environment. I often browse through books, especially the rain poems of poets. After reading a lot, I actually transferred my preferences. "The clean and mournful rain falls at dusk" is of course already well-known, and "Unable to listen through the window, the sorrow is again at the time of lighting the lamp" can also express the mood at this time. Xiao Hanjie of the Yuan Dynasty wrote in his "Lang Tao Sha" poem:</p>
<p>Wet with the fragrance of late blooms, spring rain, spring chill, sprinkled on the window and filled the door with hidden orchids. Dismal and desolate, still dripping, creating many kinds of feelings. Like scattering pearl plates with sleet, on the upstairs veranda; the mournful tune of the plantain carries sorrow. Green moss covers the steps before the hall, who will see it when they wake up in the morning?</p>
<p>This is indeed a good poem about spring rain. In addition, such as: "Several fishermen return with their bamboo hats and nets, a flower seller goes with a raincoat on his shoulder." "Let the afternoon drizzle wash away my sorrows, warm up the cold night with bonfires, hearing the fine rain tapping at the window." "A lonely lamp makes dreams easily awakened, my heart is broken by the old tunes of the Tang palace, the sound is lost in the palace clocks, dripping into my sorrowful heart, autumn is like a slender beauty in a jade tower. Outside the misty railing, the wutong trees are urged to fall, with the west wind sending them to the painted tiles." What is chanted is exactly spring rain and autumn rain.</p>
<p>In songs, I remember a "Shou Yang Qu" by Ma Zhiyuan, which chants the night rain in Xiaoxiang. The lyrics say:</p>
<p>The fishing lights are dim, the traveler's dream returns, each drop breaks my heart. A lone boat at the fifth watch, ten thousand families, is the tears of a departing person.</p>
<p>Although it does not explicitly point out the season, in my opinion, if it is not the end of spring, it is probably the beginning of autumn, otherwise there would not be these sounds. What our poets like is the pathetic and serene.</p>
<p>However, there are naturally also people who like spring rain, autumn rain, dusk, and rain in the countryside, not just because of its pathetic and serene qualities. For example, farmers do. Living in the city, daily drinking and washing do not require rainwater, and asphalt roads and cement houses are definitely not places that can accommodate serene raindrops. Therefore, everyone mostly hates bitter rain. But the countryside is not like this. Farmers like rain, especially spring rain, autumn rain, and evening rain. However, their reasons for liking it are not as empty as those of poets. In the words of Mr. Lin Yutang, they are actually utilitarians, because spring and autumn are the seasons when crops need water, and rain in the evening does not hinder work. If it does not become a disaster, they never know bitter rain.</p>
<p>Moreover, on the contrary, in drought seasons, they still have to pray for rain. The current method of praying for rain in our countryside is to prepare drums and horns, run to a place dedicated to praying for rain, worship the Dragon King, and then capture living things in a muddy pond. The best thing is a snake, a turtle, mud carp, and fish are also good. If it is a turtle or a shrimp, then everyone thinks it is terrible, saying that this is a sign of drought.</p>
<p>However, in the past, it was not the same. Zhang Zongzi wrote in his "Tao An Meng Yi":</p>
<p>In July of the Ren Shen year, every village was rained on, and they dressed up as tide gods and sea ghosts every day, competing to spit on them. In my village, they dressed up as the Water Margin heroes, and said, the painters of the Water Margin, Long Mian and Song Xue, are not as good as Shi Nai'an, but if their faces are not painted with rouge, if their mustaches are not like silkworms, if their helmets are not made of paper, if their knives and staffs are not made of trees, if their tales are not fabricated, and if their intestines are not twisted, then they are eighty or ninety percent accurate. So they split up and went out in all directions, looking for short black men, looking for tall men, finding monks, finding fat monks, finding strong women, finding beautiful women, finding men with green faces, finding men with crooked heads, finding men with red hair, finding men with beautiful beards, finding men with big black faces, and finding men with red faces and long beards. They searched the city, and if they couldn't find them, they went to the suburbs, villages, mountains, remote areas, and neighboring prefectures and counties, and hired them at high prices, getting thirty-six people. The Liangshan heroes were all alive, approaching in a proper manner, with men and horses properly dressed and moving along. The onlookers intercepted and blocked them, wanting to see Wei Jie in person...</p>
<p>The current method of praying for rain, although very cautious, is very small-scale compared to the extravagance of the Ming Dynasty. Is this progress or regression? It is really hard to say. However, the views on praying for rain are still consistent throughout the ages. Yuan Zifu wrote in his "Xiang You Xian Ping":</p>
<p>In the summer, when there is a long drought, all parties inevitably pray for rain, and the rain that comes with it is mostly the water from the rivers and lakes that is rolled up by the dragon, not formed by the interaction of yin and yang. In the summer of the seventh year of Zhenghe in Huizhou, there was a heavy rain, and two fish fell on the roof of the Dianzhong Province Office. This matter can be seen in the Later Supplement to the National History. How can there be fish in the rain? This rain is undoubtedly the water from the rivers and lakes, rolled up by the dragon.</p>
<p>Although eight hundred years have passed, and now it seems that we do not hear of any fish falling on the roof of government offices, most people still hold the same view as Yuan Zifu regarding praying for rain, thinking that it is rolled up by dragons. What exactly is going on?</p>
<p>It is probably still very difficult to say!</p>
<p>However, although this is shallow, it is not mysterious. Compared to those who only know how to like the pathetic and serene qualities of spring rain, autumn rain, dusk, and rain in the countryside, they still have a more factual basis.</p>

<h3 id="e232">The Dark Secrets of the Jimo County Government <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Amidst the nationwide crackdown on opium, a recent opium case occurred in Jimo County, with the perpetrators all being county government officials, which is truly regrettable. An Qingdao telegram on the 8th: Lu Han reported that the Jimo County government was full of dark secrets, and many officials were addicted to drugs and harbored opium dens. He secretly dispatched Yao Yijia with ten soldiers, who arrived in Jimo at 1:00 PM on the 7th, surrounded the county government and the Chamber of Commerce, and found a large number of opium and opium paraphernalia. County government secretary Song Danting fled, and the head of the finance section, Liu Minsheng, the clerk Sun Xitu, and the chief of public security, Li Shichang, were arrested. The head of the Chamber of Commerce, Hu Jiaren, escaped, and his son, Jia Zeng, was captured and tied up together, and sent to Jinan for interrogation.</p>
<p>The nature of this case is completely different from ordinary opium cases: First, the dark secrets occurred in the county government, the highest political organ of the county, which cannot be ignored. Second, public officials using drugs are clearly violating the law knowingly. Third, in addition to using drugs, they also harbor opium dens, which also constitutes the crime of dereliction of duty and malfeasance. Fourth, opium and opium paraphernalia were found in the county government, and the perpetrators were obviously using them openly, which is even more illegal. In addition, from the discovery of this case, we can see the corruption of the Jimo County officials and the darkness of the government. Fortunately, Chairman Han is impartial and strict in his handling of matters. Now that he has dispatched troops to arrest many county government officials, he should be able to handle this case according to the law, punish corrupt officials, and clarify county governance. However, in addition to the opium case, we must also pay attention to whether there are other criminal acts. Since public officials dare to harbor opium dens, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not commit other crimes. The escaped criminals should also be arrested as soon as possible, so as not to let them escape the law.</p>
<p>However, although the opium case in Jimo County is unfortunate, are there only a few secretaries and chiefs in the Jimo County government who are addicted to opium among the officials in our country? As for harboring opium dens, this situation is also not uncommon. Therefore, we believe that if the authorities are determined to eradicate the scourge of opium, they should first dismiss (or at least order to quit within a time limit) the public officials who are addicted to opium. If it is found that they are harboring opium dens, they should be severely punished. Because if they do not do so, officials cannot set an example, how can they influence the people. I wonder how Chairman Han will deal with the county government officials in this opium case.</p>
<h3 id="e233">A Drinking Party <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>When I was a child, I heard people talking about drinking parties all day long. However, what exactly is a drinking party? It seems like an extremely mysterious and incomprehensible mystery. This mysterious mystery grew with age, and even when I was studying in middle school, I still didn't understand it thoroughly. Now that I have left school, left home, and left the so-called happy family, which is actually a dark hole of an environment, and am flying freely like a nimble little bird in the circle of freedom, wandering to Shanghai and other small cities, yet this mystery still occupies my brain. After all, what exactly is it? So I felt an infinite mystery in it.</p>
<p>I had a very good opportunity to try it out. Therefore, a mysterious mystery that I couldn't understand could be explored in this opportunity. It seemed to be an indispensable page in my life history. I cherished it, and I happily and enthusiastically observed it.</p>
<p>It was the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival. I followed a friend who taught in elementary school from the countryside to Gongyibu, because they had agreed to open a room in the Guanhai Restaurant on this day, and of course, to enjoy their youth and happiness as much as possible. However, as for me? I had never lived such a life. Even on the long and distant journey of wandering, I lived a lonely life. Therefore, I was holding such a swinging mood towards this fresh and lively life.</p>
<p>The destination had arrived, and we stepped onto the upper floor of the Guanhai Hotel. It was quiet here, perhaps a necessary result of the economic panic. Such a tall hotel had no business at all. Even on this good festival, there were not many young people who came to revel, only our group. When I stepped into the room, they were already playing mahjong with a snap, snap, snap. On a</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>square table, each of the young people on each side was tightly stretching their flushed faces, and their eyes were calmly turning on the tiles. A waiter was serving tea and sending hot towels. Here, a row of windows faced south. The south was a railway station, a factory, and next to the restaurant was a flowing stream. From here, you could see a vast expanse of white river water, and in the distance, the mountain peaks, plains, and villages were shrouded in the clouds, all of which were silent. However, the liveliness in this room made me feel unfamiliar and unaccustomed, and I felt very sad in my heart. They were talking about their own things, laughing about their own things, and the stories about women they were talking about had no appeal to me at all. Therefore, although the people here were lively, I was obviously lonely, as if I were in another terrible world. Yes, if I had learned to play mahjong when I was a child, and had learned to do some so-called mysterious things, I think I would not have had such a terrible sadness as today. However, do I curse? I currently seem to be a prisoner enduring the irony in front of everyone's faces, terribly lonely.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, they finished four rounds, and it was already three o'clock in the afternoon. They talked about calling Meihua to accompany them to the drinking party. This, of course, I knew, and my heart rose with a strange desire again. After a while, Miss Meihua stepped into the room gracefully.</p>
<p>She did not refuse anyone's embrace, nor did she refuse anyone's kiss. Three young men whom I had never met, who lived a theatrical troupe life in Gongyi, were making music, singing and laughing, as if they had forgotten their pain. They all joked with her. So, the room seemed particularly lively, but I had become an idiot, thinking wildly. I was afraid, I was ashamed, I dared not approach her, and I dared not even look at her. Even I didn't believe that I was one of the group. However, sometimes when I saw their hands causing her chest to feel pain, she let out a mournful sound, which almost struck my soul. She dared not cry, nor dare curse, thus making their eyes flash with joyous brilliance.</p>
<p>Drinking and eating turned everyone as hot as fire. So, my soul burned up and down. After a while, they continued to play cards. She had taken turns at each position to help them for a while. The pain she endured, perhaps was also pleasure, and there were also sarcastic words. Continuing like this in the crazed circle, as for me, I seemed to be hearing the whip of the referee, just silently. This long evil play continued until two o'clock in the middle of the night, and I didn't even see a bit of a bright moon. Then I followed them to eat a midnight snack again. After eating the midnight snack, a group of young people dispersed, and I went to another room to lie down my tired body, thinking wildly—this night, she spent the night with that young man, maybe it was happy!</p>
<p>When I got up the next morning, I returned to her and his room. At that time, she ridiculed me like a loving mother; squinting her eyes and patting my shoulder:</p>
<p>"You kid, you don't understand anything, you've suffered in front of us."</p>
<p>Oh! My face turned red, and I left her speechless, but I already recognized this mysterious mystery, the drinking party, the sinful drinking party!!</p>
<h3 id="e234">Little Gleanings Under the Lamp <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>(1) An Ancient Mirror</p>
<p>On the second night of returning to my hometown, I found an ancient mirror while tidying up my books. I was at a loss, as if I had lost everything. When I regained some clarity, I only felt a sour feeling in my eyes. Ah, this ancient mirror, this ancient mirror! Speaking to myself, tears dripped onto the ancient mirror. It was an ancient mirror left by my mother, but according to what my mother said when she was alive, it was brought from my maternal grandmother's side.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ancient mirror is of course an ancient mirror!</p>
<p>I still remember my maternal grandmother's gray hair. This ancient mirror, my maternal grandmother must have looked into. But where can I find my maternal grandmother's white hair at this moment? In the ancient mirror, I am reflected, a haggard, thin, and teary-eyed young man. My mother must have also looked into it. But where can I find my mother's shadow at this moment? In the ancient mirror, I am reflected, a haggard, thin, and teary-eyed young man.</p>
<p>When I was young, by my mother's side, I often competed with Fangmei for the ancient mirror. Everyone was happy to look at their playful and mischievous faces in the ancient mirror. A few years later, Fangmei passed away, and my mother also passed away. I drifted to a distant place like a lone goose. My father only loved to hold a long-stemmed pipe, and did not like to look in the mirror. Therefore, the ancient mirror was buried in the books.</p>
<p>This time, I unearthed the ancient mirror that had been buried for many years like an archaeologist. I was delighted, and I felt a strong sense of sadness, but who could I tell?</p>
<p>The mercury on the back of the mirror had faded, but after wiping away the dust on the surface of the mirror, the ancient mirror was still bright. Looking at it alone, looking at it, like a hero who had killed all the enemies, looking at his own bloody knife on an evening in late autumn, he felt lonely and desolate! As time goes on, this ancient mirror may fall into the hands of others. But at that time, who will be an archaeologist, who will recall my current haggard, thin, and teary-eyed face to one in ten thousand?</p>
<p>(2) Listening to the Wind</p>
<p>Most of the scenery of nature is suitable for seeing. You can see the brilliant sunset, you can see the brilliant rainbow with seven colors after the rain, you can see the shy flowers with dewdrops, and you can also see the vast expanse of misty waves for thousands of miles.</p>
<p>But I seem to be particularly happy to listen. I feel that listening is far better than seeing. I am of course happy to listen to a spring-singing oriole, to listen to the sound of cicadas in a tree in late autumn, to listen to the surging of a river of waves, and to listen to the sound of ten thousand raindrops hitting the roof, making the sound of shattered jade. But what makes me even happier is listening to the wind.</p>
<p>Move a deck chair in the garden, close your eyes, and listen to a gust of light wind passing through the green shade, the leaves rubbing against each other. This sound is so subtle, and this beautiful enjoyment of stillness in movement is far better than seeing.</p>
<p>In the evening, I often like to open the window and lie lonely in bed with my eyes closed, quietly listening to a gust of wind rushing up to the window, and then the pages of the book on the table turn over, one page after another, turning over and over again. I think this tedious sound is the best to listen to. Sometimes the curtains also flutter, which makes people think that their bed is a lone boat floating on the vast waves, and of course they are a lone guest on the lone boat. So, I open the flowers of memory and think of some stories from many years ago…</p>
<p>If it is a strong wind, and it is also in the middle of the night, then close the windows tightly and listen quietly in the dark as the wind attacks the jungle, like ten thousand horses galloping, like a tsunami turning over dragons, like a tiger roaring and a lion roaring. Calmly listen with bated breath, and gradually your hair will stand on end, and you will even be afraid to move, as if something dangerous will fall down immediately if you move. But the mind is not easy to calm down, it will think of the reefs of the Arctic Ocean, it will think of the wild beasts in the deep mountains, it will think of all kinds of alarming and frightening things…. Because it is listening, because the eyes are closed, so you will think of all kinds of things more than seeing.</p>
<p>Listening to the wind is indeed a joy for me.</p>
<h3 id="e235">One Night in Xuzhou (Continued) <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Menghua</p>
<p>Soon, we fell asleep. In my dream, I dreamed of this strange girl. I clearly saw her sparse bangs, her pale face, her slender body, and her mournful eyes. She also seemed to be complaining to me in a gloomy voice. She was crying, crying desperately...</p>
<p>In the morning, before the alarm clock that I brought with me rang, a burst of noise woke me up. In a daze, I vaguely heard a man shouting. I tried my best to open my very heavy eyelids and leaned up from the bed. In this way, I clearly heard a man's angry scolding and a woman's low weeping. In addition, there were many noisy voices, as if people were mediating.</p>
<p>At this moment, my friend walked into the room. Obviously, he had been awakened long ago.</p>
<p>"What exactly is going on with the noise outside?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That woman from last night had an accident." He said. "Get up quickly, it's time."</p>
<p>"Freezing to death will get us into trouble, what a joke!" The waiter shouted outside. "Damn it, black-hearted, you won't have a good reward in your life. She stayed up all night last night, she</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>said that going back is death, and not going back is also death, so she would rather die here. This girl is also too tough."</p>
<p>"That's right, her cheekbones are on fire, burning red, and she's coughing." Another person said.</p>
<p>"What exactly is the matter?" I asked my friend, "Who is scolding her?"</p>
<p>"It's the 'turtle head'. He's also scolding the waiters in this inn. They almost beat him, fortunately I was there to mediate."</p>
<p>Suddenly, her gaunt face floated before my eyes again. This white rose in the storm.</p>
<p>"What if she had a guest last night?" I thought to myself, and unconsciously said it out loud.</p>
<p>My friend seemed not to have heard my words. He weighed the quilt with his hand and said in a self-satisfied tone:</p>
<p>"Hey, if it weren't for this quilt last night, I might have frozen to death in Xuzhou!"</p>
<h3 id="e236">Main Street <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Green Leaves</p>
<p>——Impressions of an Ancient City</p>
<p>On the main street, there is something special: tall windows and gray walls. The sun shines forlornly on the gray, sandy street, and on the plain cloth awnings of the cloth shops and wine houses against the gray sky. The street is filled with the "ka-dong, ka-dong" sound of rickshaw pullers' copper bells, forlornly echoing in the gray sand. This is life painted in gray, with that gray tone. The livelihood of an entire family revolves on those wheels.</p>
<p>The street is paved with gravel, and in the bright sunlight and wind, gray sand rolls along the ground, blurring in the air. Over there, I can see the gray, peeling city walls, and the drowsy, gray soldiers, with only the tips of their guns visible on the city walls. A few crows adorn this desolate scene, adding to the grayness.</p>
<p>The main street is desolate. A few women with children are watching the excitement or occasionally buying things, arguing with the shopkeepers over prices. At times, there are wanderers wandering on the main street for most of the day, harboring memories of their distant hometowns, and all day long, mediators, also gray, walk on the street, walking, walking.</p>
<p>Sometimes, on the main street, there is a ragged peddler, selling children's toys and candy. He manipulates the toys in his hands, shouting, and the children watch these interesting toys, their shiny black eyes fixed on the little tricks of the toy. So, they ask their mothers to buy one. The peddler is also clever. He knows exactly what the children want at this moment; he will follow closely beside the child, asking, and so, the mother buys the toy. This is an interesting scene in an ancient city.</p>
<p>Along the street are many fruit stalls and secondhand goods stalls. Beside the stalls are old, coughing men. They talk to each other, chatting about this and that, chatting about their sons and daughters-in-law for most of the day. There are also talkative ones who smoke their pipes all day long, chatting, and sometimes dealing with customers, passing the time.</p>
<p>I once spent five copper coins to buy a pear to quench my thirst, but I only took one bite before throwing it on the ground. The taste was bitter and astringent, and the inside was like cotton, filled with gray sand. Eating fruit in the ancient city is not a happy experience.</p>
<p>On the main street, you can buy anything, such as coal, cigarettes, wine, cloth, and small items for women, like buttons and thread. These are all more expensive than those sold in the alleys, which is the usual practice of the market. The main street is the most prosperous market in the ancient city. Now, the main street is desolate. There are no customers in the shops. Previously, the cloth shops were crowded with people, demanding a bit of cloth, just a cacophony of women's and men's voices. Now, the cloth shops are deserted. So much old stock is piled up in the shops, some even from Tokyo and Shanghai, flashing red and green in the sunlight. Young shop assistants are secretly dozing off at the counter. The market is declining: only desolation and grayness remain.</p>
<p>In the small theaters on the main street, many people seek a little warmth to comfort their hearts and add some color to the dullness of their gray lives. The main street, on the contrary, is lonely and deserted. Three or four stray dogs run down the street with their tails between their legs, and a broken rickety car drives through the street, "ta-da, ta-da." The big drum on the street also "de, de, de," bangs and bangs. This is also a special phenomenon in the market.</p>

<p>Money is Omnipotent</p>
<p>Theme Song from the Shanghai Film Company's Sound Film "Peach Blossom Dream"</p>
<p>(The Emperor sings on his throne) Silver clouds gently illuminate the golden mountains, golden light brightly illuminates the waves of the world. Who can stem the raging tides? Without gold, there is nothing to eat; without silver, there is nothing to wear. Even if you are talented, handsome, meritorious, and virtuous, possessing everything, if you cannot amass and manage money, humph, humph! Your entire life will be incompetent, without fortune, power, or influence. Everyone will hate you, and everyone will dislike you, carrying your lifelong hardship to the underworld. (Everyone) We praise the omnipotence of money! Your Majesty, the Emperor, is all-powerful, with boundless magic, employing both grace and authority, accomplished in both civil and military affairs. Long live, long live, ten thousand long lives!</p>
<p>(Citizen A) Long live, grant justice! (Empress, in a white voice) What grievances do you have? (Citizen A) I am now carrying a heavy burden of a thousand gold. Year after year, I toil and suffer, year after year, I am hungry and cold. Alas, from morning till night, my wife complains and my children resent me. What a grievance! (The Empress summons the Money Arhat.) (Deity A) What is your command? (Empress) Quickly put steel plates on both sides of his face, so they are firm and thick, and he won't be ashamed. From now on, you will earn your meals and make money relying on a thick skin. Hey! Don't care about anything! (The crowd joins in singing the refrain)</p>
<p>(Citizen B) Long live, save my life! (Empress, in a white voice) What danger are you in? (Citizen B) I have spent effort and energy to obtain a high official position. I have collected miscellaneous taxes and levies with a loyal heart, fearing that everyone will rebel and kick me out. How dangerous! (The Empress summons the Silver Dollar Arhat.) (Deity B) What is your command? (Empress) Quickly replace his conscience with a lump of coal, so it is dirty and black, leaning to one side. From now on, you will loot and hoard money, causing families to be ruined and destroyed. Hey! Don't care about anything! (The crowd joins in singing the refrain)</p>
<p>(Citizen C) Long live, show mercy! (Empress, in a white voice) What difficulties are you facing? (Citizen C) Now the world's great powers have countless wealth. They continuously send in military supplies and transport them across the mountains and passes. Many high officials are daring, but I dare not do it. How miserable! (The Empress summons the Banknote Arhat.) (Deity C) What is your command? (Empress) Quickly put all the blood and sweat in his body into an ice pool, let it be cold, let it be hard, freezing his mind and heart. From now on, you will sell out the country and surrender to the enemy, becoming a traitor and a running dog. Hey! Don't care about anything! (The crowd joins in singing the refrain)</p>
<p>(Refrain) We praise the omnipotence of money! Your Majesty, the Emperor, is all-powerful, with boundless magic, possessing everything. What should we do? How should we do it? (Empress, singing alone) Do whatever you want! Golden light and silver vapor spread… (The crowd joins in singing) Do whatever you want! (Empress, singing alone) We will turn the world upside down… (The crowd joins in singing) Do whatever you want! (Empress, singing alone) We will make the seas run dry and the stones crumble! (The crowd joins in singing) Do whatever you want! (Singing together) It's not difficult!</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Butterfly Dream Marriage"</p>
<p>Silver candles shine in the frosted tent, filling it with fragrance. A young widow carefully puts on makeup. Suddenly, she sees an old servant arrive. Her brows lift with joy as she enters the painted hall. Madam, I will report to the young master that I am grateful for your kindness. First, put away the mourning garments and choose an auspicious day for the wedding. Old one, choosing a day is not as good as stumbling upon one. Why not complete the wedding tonight? I will fulfill my desire for a romantic affair. Arrange it quickly and enter the bridal chamber. Quickly go to the boudoir and put on your auspicious clothes. Let this old servant act as the master of ceremonies and invite the groom. Pay respects to heaven and earth, enter the bridal chamber, and sit shoulder to shoulder, hiding your faces with fans. Foolish Tian stealthily looks at him and sees him tightly frowning, tears filling his eyes. With a loud cry, she falls down, startling Tian in a panic. Old one, why is your young master acting like this? Quickly help the young man into bed. The young master has always had heart pain. No doctor in the world has a wonderful cure. China does have living human brains, and taking them will have a powerful effect. I'm afraid there are no brains here, and the scholar will die. Old one, can the newly deceased be used? If so, there is room for discussion. Madam, it can still be used before the seventh day. Taking it will have a quick and strong effect. Hearing this, Tian splits open the coffin.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Woman Cries for Agarwood"</p>
<p>Autumn scenery, the fragrance of osmanthus in August. A sentimental woman sits in her boudoir. All she hears is the endless chirping of insects outside the window, and the wind blowing the purple bamboo with a rustling sound. The iron horse on the eaves clashes. She lowers her head and thinks to herself. She thinks of the handsome and talented man from her maiden home. She has not been married to her husband for even half a month. A maid brings a letter to my room, saying that the talented man is sick in bed. I face the incense table and offer empty prayers, begging the heavens and the city god, hoping that he will be safe and healthy. I have not been married for even a month. A maid brings a letter to my room, saying that the talented man has passed away. It has made me cry to death several times and return to life. My husband asks me why I am so sad. I only say that the pain in my abdomen is the hardest to bear. I should be offering condolences before the spirit, but I am only a new bride who has not yet completed her first month of marriage, so it is inconvenient for me to attend the funeral. I can only secretly wear three parts of mourning and put a piece of hemp cloth on my chest. I don't wear red or green clothes, only two pieces of plain clothes. On a pair of arched shoes, I put hemp cloth. I send a maid to buy a piece of agarwood. I carve the talented man's handsome face. I carve him wearing a square scarf with fluttering ribbons, with white jade emitting light in the center. He wears a dark blue robe with a yellow belt, red satin shoes with black satin trim. I can't carve you pacing back and forth in the study. I can't carve you calling me "dear sister." I can't carve you playing chess and looking around. I can't carve you urging me several times to not separate because the wedding sedan is arriving at the hall. I have to harden my heart and say goodbye to the talented man. When I got into the sedan, I cried sadly. The idlers only gossiped, saying that I couldn't bear to leave my father and mother. Little did they know that I couldn't bear to leave the affectionate and righteous talented man. Talented man, I worship you on the dressing table during the day. In the evening, I use the green gauze curtain as a shrine. In this world, there are so many sad things. Others' sadness can be grieved. My sadness is hidden in my heart.</p>

<p>Mao Zhizhong's Fine Arts Lecture</p>
<p>Hangye (1180) 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM</p>
<p>The qualities of painting: 1. Literati painting includes those by writers and epigraphers. 2. Famous painters have Southern and Northern schools. 3. Popular painting learns from everyone and does not distinguish between schools. Those who enter through the three categories of spirit, mystery, and ability belong to popular painting; those who do not belong to literati painting. Teaching painting: 3. Lectures on the biographies of painters.</p>

<p>The Singing Arts Association advocates not singing risqué songs. Recently, it has temporarily published "Yi Guang Qu" in × newspaper as scheduled. All manuscripts related to singing arts will be accepted with a fee. (Mailbox 1862).</p>
<p>The Yi Sheng Singing Team will hold a general meeting on the 10th of this month (Sunday) at 3:00 PM at the Qingnian Hui on North Sichuan Road. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Lang always uses the phrase "his old lady's family..." when talking to people.</p>
<p>The Drama Group of the Yi Ming Society, which is staging "The Tempest," has recently hired Mr. Zhang, the son of the former magistrate of Shanghai County, as the director, which has added a lot of color.</p>
<p>Miss Bai Na is Lu Qiongxian of Shanghai Women's High School. Miss Xu Xuan is Xu Huiqin of Shanghai Women's High School. They are both seventeen years old, inseparable, and like sisters. (From Shanghai Style)</p>

<h3 id="e242">Xu Lai's Wonderful Performance <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>It is the season when the fragrance of osmanthus flowers fills the air. By the clear Zihu Lake, Xu Lai and her old father, for the sake of livelihood, shout loudly every day: "Hey! Is anyone going to Yue Fei's Tomb? Is anyone going to Yue Fei's Tomb?"</p>
<p>Of course, such a beautiful woman will secretly be coveted by others. In this place, there is a philandering man who calls himself an artist, Sun Min.</p>
<p>Spring does not last long, and the weather gradually turns to late autumn. When artists and travelers come to Hangzhou to appreciate the scenery, Xu Lai's old father's old illness recurs and he cannot operate the boat. As a result, the boat rental is overdue. The fat Tan Zhiyuan, who manages a dozen boats, urges them every day. Sun Min takes this opportunity to bribe him and uses the means of demanding money to coerce them. If they don't have money to repay the debt, Xu Lai must be a "model" once. So, in a helpless situation, Xu Lai had to make her sacred body an object of appreciation for beauty—the beautiful shadow in the painting.</p>
<p>This scene is Xu Lai's most wonderful performance in the monster Shen Xiling's film "Boat Girl."</p>
<h3 id="e243">MGM's Grand Musical Film "The Great Ziegfeld" Premieres <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Isn't the "Les Misérables" currently showing in Nanjing a huge sensation for audiences at sea? However, the MGM musical opera that follows "Les Misérables" should win the general welcome and praise of movie fans at sea even more so; because "The Great Ziegfeld" has brought together Elena Powell, the most famous Tartar dance saint and diva in Europe and America, Jack Benny, the originator of humorous radio broadcasts, and 200 newly selected song and dance beauties, as well as 15 MGM stars, to jointly perform the 1936-style American art song and dance, which can be called an unprecedented creation of the 20th century. As for the seven-year production and the millions of dollars spent on scenery, it is only an extra matter for this great song and dance film. The left is one of the singing and dancing scenes in the film.</p>
