<h3 id="c2">減免出口稅後應有之努力 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>海關出口稅則。爲欲喊免出口貨稅。重加修正。已於本月二十五日公布矣。此次修正之結果。動物產品。大都獲减稅之益。海產魚介。乾鮮果品。則全部免稅。蔬菜·植物油頻·及花生·生仁·亦皆减稅。而去年占有出口貨總值百分之五。七四之五金。除黃紫銅錫錠塊外。亦皆免稅。雜貨類之所免尤多。譽凡本報昔所望於當局應施喊免者。（見二四·三·二七、時評）今什九皆得實現矣。計此次减稅品凡四十一。免稅品凡八十七。加以原已免稅之三十八品。出口貨得免稅者共有一百二十五品。可謂除我國所特產偶有一二照徵者外。大宗出口貨俱蒙喊免之益矣。</p>
<p>際此國家財政困難之秋。而政府能有此措置。雖未克立予施行。而其維護工商業之苦心。當爲國人所共見。况所以不能卽見實行之故。有如孔部長所云。「……一旦裁撤。在未確定抵補前。收入勢必大受影響。政府一面注意救濟工商業。一面對收支平衡。亦須兼顧。俟抵補籌妥。卽當實行」。乃在財政上一時尚無彌補辦法也。竊以爲籌補之道。或舉辦公平之新稅。或整理舊有之稅收。然唯一之抵補。要當仍在增加進口稅率。以增加進進稅之所得。彌補喊免出口稅之所失。其勢旣順。而於保護本國農工商業。其道亦周。又爲國際間所共趨之途徑。固無所用共猶豫也。</p>
<p>或謂嚴稅壁壘固爲今日世界各國所通行。顧中國則情形特殊。時有形禁勢格之感。卽如二十三年棉貨海產稅則之變更。亦所以徇友邦之請求。設此種形勢而不改變。則進口稅之增加。動多製肘。况尚有互惠恊定之品。將來卽有所增。恐亦無幾。夫關稅之增喊。爲一國之內政。甲國課乙國進口貨品以重稅乙國祇有施以報復稅。之一法例如最近日本因坎拿大增加日貨進口稅。並於普通進口稅外復課以其他關稅。而日人所以對付之者。亦祗有課坎拿大進口之木料·小麥·麪粉·紙漿等八種·以從價五成之進口稅。（見二十六日日聯社電）。舍此以外。不聞有其他舉動也。是可知商品稅率之變更。除恊定稅則外絕無外。人置喙之餘地。况我國進口稅則卽有變更。亦爲自圖生存起見。與坎拿大課稅之含有排他性質者有別。更無招致外人異議之理。</p>
<p>惟我國之出口稅。雖未全蠲。而已逐漸喊免矣。故使財政而有辦法。我知政府决不吝此出口稅而不予以全部免除也。夫政府之所能加惠於工商業者。只有保護之一法。今出口稅旣大部减免矣。我工商業將如何推銷其出品於海外。此工商業本身之責任也。以往出口事業之失敗。言者雖諄諄。而工　。所以自效者何。如如今國難方毀。外貨傾銷。更形猛烈。我工商業處　更艱所負之職責亦更鉅。若猶是因循苟安。祇圖目前之小利。不計後計之大難。則其最大之成就。亦不過乞人餘瀝之一洋貨販賣商耳。故此後出口業如何謀發展是在各業痛自檢點已往之失敗。及他人所以優勝於我者何在。一面聯合出口有關各業。在海外作共同之奮鬥。在國內作密切之聯絡。咸具絕處求生之决心。百折不回之精神。其他各方。亦當爲出口事業盡其最大之助力。出以同情之監督。而爲保持出口貨品信用起見。尤應由同業自行嚴格檢騐。無使低劣貨品冒濫出售。以保全我對外之信用。其由國家辦理者。亦望其手續簡便。辦事迅速。取費輕微。能如是經各方不斷之努力。對外輸出。或有轉機之望乎。</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於本年十月間召集海軍會議之談判、英國方面雖努力進行、然目前似已陷於僵局、蓋德國不欲立卽提出海軍造艦程序之詳細計畫、德國對於海軍何所企圖、頗爲暗昧、而以關於航空母艦一事爲尤然、據德國報紙發表消息、德國擬建造航空母艦二艘、英國官方人士聞之頗爲焦憂、蓋英德海軍協定規定德國建造潛水艇得超過百分三十五之比率、以至於與英國相等、此項規定、用意本在使德國將航空母艦噸數、移作建造潛艇之用、今則一般人深恐德國仍行建造航空母艦、以造成海軍問題之新形勢、然後再行要求增加潛水艇比率、傳聞如英國允許德國立卽開始建造潛艇、則德國可在一九三六年華盛頓條約滿期以前、不建造主力艦云、此外英國政府與法國·意大利·蘇聯·所作關於海軍會議之預備談判、已發生重大困難、因此海軍會議能否在英國所提議之時期開會、殊爲疑問、英國日前邀請法俄國三國派遣海軍專家、於最近時期在倫敦舉行海軍會議預備談話、然法國方面之答覆、則謂法國如參加此項談話、則輿論將以爲法國默認英德海軍恊定、意國政府則表示須俟相當時期、方可派專家赴倫敦、至於蘇聯則亦取同樣保留態度、並表示反對穗國增加波羅的海艦隊、謂英德海軍協定旣已成立、則唯一保障波羅的海安全之法、當由英國允許於戰時尊重丹麥海峽（卽波羅的海與北海連接之海峽）之中立云、因此可見卽專家預備談話、亦恐難以舉行、又聞英國提議如海軍會議在本年十月間開會、則應列入以下各項議題、（一）如海軍總噸數不能規定各國間之比率、則對於各級軍艦之噸數及砲徑、至少項規定最大限度、（二）出席海軍會議各國應允許各以六年內之海軍造艦計畫、通知其他各國政府、且約定在六年內不變更此項預定之造艦計畫、然若干民主國家、政府屢有更迭、政治策略亦旬多緩更、故欲在六年內不變更造艦計畫、殊屬難能、此亦海軍會議前途之一困難也、（二十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>營業報吿謂獲利二萬二千三百八十餘元、是年其資產項下應剔除者九萬五千四百餘元、故是年所虧耗則計七萬三千餘元、二十一年彼雖仍謂獲利一萬六千餘元、實際則須虧耗六萬七千餘元、二十二年謂有利一萬零七百餘元、而資產項下應除外者為十萬四千餘、故終須折閱九萬二千餘金、查其歷年報吿所謂庫存現金、實係一種宕賬、而所謂獲利、皆屬</p>

<p>公告經過</p>
<p>上海中華足球自榮膺本屆萬國足球及中葡兩國國際杯兩錦標以來、聲名遠震海外、以南洋羣島各地、對於國內球隊技能之高超、迭次前往比賽、成續卓著、欽佩無已、爪哇羣力體育會、會致函全國體育協進會邀請上海中華隊、於暑期中赴該地比賽、傳增僑胞眼界、並收助取他山之益、來往用資及房住等、均由該會負担、協會當局、因鑒於本屆全運及明年在德之世運兩會之比賽、正擬謀人才之訓練、此等機會、極合需要、不特爲球員個人之造詣、亦即爲上海市及全國栽培人才之需、意善効宏、何樂而不爲、因即復電接受、委中華足球委員會、愼密討論、選隊準備、蒙委余任管理之職、即向中華隊隊員接洽、莫不表示同情、枕戈待發、即於每日晨六時在申園訓練、藉同實力、庶不負異域僑胞之熱望焉、惟各人職業關係、須經公私兩方、向其所居機關正式請假、轉輾一月有奇、結果好事多磨、有數球員、竟不能如願同行、推其原委、其中實有素抱提倡足球爲懷者、具管蠡之見耳、夫體育之意旨、是爲人民增康健、與國家之强盛、有莫大關係、坐井觀天、決非提倡體育之應有眼光、按本球隊林立、其間優秀人才實多、斷非因數球昌　克成行、而使南征種阻、蓋以對方所希望者、是華人强隊、若濫竿充、唯恐有負彼邦人士之熱望耳、因不得已邀約港方球員、以補其缺、蓋此行之主旨、是訓練人才、不諭港滬、同屬一國之光勞、此策亦不可言非是、維歡自命提倡甘願解鈴繋鈴、與素志相背引爲憾事、臨行謹將經過陳容、希各界諒解辦事之不週焉、（余衡之）</p>
<p>實力甚强</p>
<p>該隊共十七人、暨領隊管理共十九人、球員原均在上海方面挑選、嗣以張業才陳洪光馮運佑顧尚勸賈幼良等、均因事不克隨行、乃不得已向港方邀請麥蘇、李國釗、曹柱成、何家成、及已赴星洲之鄭李良五人加入（上海共十二人、預定在爪哇共賽十五塲、至於所往各地、臨時邀約之比賽、尚不在內、預定九月初返國、全隊前鋒力量最爲强勁、中綫較弱、但李國釗球藝已臻上乘、尚可應付、後衛與中綫相仿、惟聞麥蘇之技術、在香港首屈一指、較之李天生、有過之無不及、惜守門蔽徐亨一人而已、如無特珠變故、當可勝任愉快、總之、該隊實力、退爲淸意、預料此行、必得美滿之結果也、</p>

<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>—統一販賣機關—</p>
<p>目前我國的出版界，其最感困難之點：（一）是同業間的競爭，（二）是中間商人的操縱，（三）是帳欵之不易收回，（四）是書籍推銷的困難。而如營業之不振與資金之難以周轉，我以爲尚是其次，因前者若能解决，後面的困難亦打隨以消除也。</p>
<p>要解决這四個困難之點，那末經營出版業者，不可不有一種根本的覺悟，從今起，專事出版，不要兼營販賣。而這種覺悟，在小資本的出版家，我以爲尤有必要，因爲資本巨大的出版業者，他可以一方而從事有計畫的生產，另一方面並可廣設販賣機關於各地，使書籍之分配普及於全國。但在小資本的出版家，則俱力有所未能。反之，他在一方面要受到大出版家的壓迫，另一方面還要受同業間的傾軋。故爲對抗大出版家的壓迫，而求自力更生之道，今日的小出版家，殊不可不有一致的聯合，將出版與販賣二者，分別開來，成爲獨立的經營。由這個生產興分配分工的原則，我主張聯合各出版業者設一統一的販賣機關。其理由與辦法有如次：</p>
<p>現在的小書店，爲了要銷售其齊籍，勢不得不各設一門市販賣部，而此門市又須設在地價甚昂的福州路。福州路一帶原爲商業中心區，小書店之所以必須羣聚於此者，一是因爲大書鋪如商務中華都在那裏，二則因爲上海無文化的中心區域，所謂大學者多分散於東西南北四郊，並不集中於一處。所以小書店之獨力開設門市於福州路，實在是件極不經濟的事。倘能彼此合作，成立一個總的販賣機關，那來，在各家的經濟上必有很多的補益，且小商店之不足與大規模的百貨店相敵，是很明白的事，故如統一的販賣機關之設立，必然的比小書舖的單獨門市更能得到購買者的注意。這是出版業者經濟上的節省，其利一。</p>
<p>次之，因爲有統一的販賣機關，於是如中問商人的剝削操縱及欠欵不還等弊病，便可完全打破。上海的小書舖所最無可如何的，便是各地的販賣，不得不委託一般書商。因爲這種書商在中間的盤剝，上海經營出版業者，於其所出書籍，定價不得不高，然而其所收入，仍是七折八扣，甚至連血本也不容易收回。而讀者勝書則例須依照定價十足，或竟外加郵費郵故中間書商的存在，於出版業者爲不利，於讀者亦只有愈到高抬價格的苦痛，實爲文化發展前途的障碍。倘有統一的販賣機關，於上海設總局，於各地設分局，如此，那些中問書商不僅無從乘機取利，並且，像今日那樣欠欵不還的弊病，也可完全消除。因如今日的書商，常利用小書局之各自爲政對於甲書局之欵項，簡直置之不理，甲書局方面因其遠在外埠，不便往索，於是只得自己吃虧，决定以後不再批書與彼，在甲書局，以爲這樣當可置書商於絕境，然而事實不然，他因爲與乙書局的往來，仍舊可以批到甲書局的書。所以除非甲乙丙丁等書局能一致聯合，外埠欠欵不還的書商，仍舊有法子可以批到各書局的書籍。這樣的事情實在很多，實爲小書舖所最感苦痛者，倘若統一的販賣機關能够成立，外埠書商欲批售甲乙丙丁等各書舖的出版物，必須經由這個機關，那來他就無所施其狡展之技。並且，以各地分機關的存在，可以直接索取，他就更無任意拖欠的餘地了。這是統一的販賣機關給與出版業者經營上的便利，其利二。</p>
<p>再因上海有統一的總販賣機關，內地有分設的機關，於是一書出版之後，便可立即分送至全國，與讀者相接觸，不致如今日那樣，出版家出書，苦於找不到讀者，而讀者則雖見到廣告，要想購買，却苦找不到書店，或者深苦匯欵買來之後，而內容不佳，受廣告宣傳欺騙的捐失。這種出版界與讀書界相隔絕的現象，有了統一的販賣機關，便可得到聯絡，並且，還可免除大出版家的壓迫。蓋大出版家之所利，即因有雄厚之資本，故能在各地俱設分店，而小出版家則不能，現在若有統一的販賣機關，那來小出版家便與大出版家同其利，可無虞大出版家之獨占的壓迫了。這是其利三。</p>
<p>還有販賣機關若興出版機關分離而單獨經營，那末從事出版業者，便可專心出版，不必顧到販賣，在組織上只要有一個編輯部便可一切措置裕如了。（如印刷等，可由專門的印刷機關辦理。）這樣，不僅資本可以集中，在經濟上爲有利，員人力集中，在經營上也可收專門之功。這種生產與分配的分工，即現代資本主義生產最進步之點。出版事業旣爲現代產業之一種，當然也非採取進步的方法不可，否則，就難免於落伍而爲所淘汰。這是其利四。</p>
<p>至於這個統一的販賣機關，要怎樣纔能建立成功，則我以爲首須有巨大的資本，至少得有三數十萬，纔能遍全國各地的把販賣機關建立起來，蓋非如此，販賣之網不能普遍，於書籍之推銷將大有影響。次之，這個機關的組織，必須是與出版業無關的第三者，始能維持居中的地位，但是同時，亦有待於出版家的參加，始能保有聯繫。並使參加組織之出版家，立即放棄其販賣上的業務。</p>
<p>抑出版業之在我國各種事業中，實為最有希望者。蓋以敎育之普及，文化之進步，識字讀書者必日益增多，即其營業市塲只有日趨擴大。又以出版業爲文化事業故，如郵費關稅等等，都較其他商業享有特殊利益，這是爲任何事業所無的便利。且如我國今日的產業，幾無一不能免於帝國主義者的壓迫，如烟草，棉紗，麵粉等等，都以外貨的傾銷與外廠的競爭，陷於困難的境地，只有出版業無此現象，其在中國，簡直是獨占的天下，故若能經營得法，實儘多發展的餘地。而如目前經濟的不景氣，究不過一時的現象，倘能力圖改革，那來决不是沒有辦法的。</p>

<p>十九　羣衆圖書公司</p>
<p>這個書店的歷史是相當長的，而且頗有老當益肚，雖是風燭殘年，仍不畏長途跋涉，跟着別人賽跑之槪。</p>
<p>稍留意一些書業情形的，提起羣衆，就會想到是「跟着人家跑」。在初期，羣衆的一些一黨義」方面書籍，確曾獲了相當利益，但大部是由雜凑而成，經不起別家後起的競爭。不久，隨新興文學的發達，羣衆也曾了不少文學書，而這些文學書又是去「禮拜×」不遠的東西，現在自無立足地了。再後，來了一些「××甲選」之類的編集，這可說是羣衆出版物中較有意義的。</p>
<p>羣衆的門市部在現代時代（以前新月）等之間，祇有這樣小小的半間，因夾在別家漂亮的門面之間，益顯出羣衆的門面狹小了。但羣衆的門面並不因狹小而失其顧客，不過其顧客大部非自己的而已。以前，因「黎明」的門市附設在羣衆，使羣業的現購生意帶起不少，後來，又因上海雜誌公司設立在羣衆，竟至「門庭若市」，但自「黎明」「上海」先後成立自己的門市以後，羣衆的營業自然受到打擊，但繁衆的「跟着人家跑」是素有把握的，接着自已也改爲「雜誌公司」並目還出版了幾種畫報等定期刋物，可是跟着人家跑以「落後」爲多，何况其所出版的刊物，不論是內容與形式，都是同樣的窮乏，要說羣衆有可引人注意的話，那祇有以前的「濤聲」和現在的「芒種」了。</p>
<p>二十　廣益書局</p>
<p>廣益書局主要的是舊書，不過也曾出版了幾本新書。據說廣益在舊書（古書）方面的營業，每年很可觀的，其所出版的舊書性質如何，日不具論，而就新書而言，委實過於投機了。試看所出版的如「×××作法」之類的東西，形式上固很時髦，而內容上則其本身還是大部須研究一下「作法」的。本來，一元或數角一千字稿費的文章，欲不粗製濫造，又豈能得哉？</p>
<p>廣益的新書出版現在似乎减少（甚成沒有）了，這，我們不能說不是廣益的一「得」策。</p>
<p>二十一　光明，樂華，文藝</p>
<p>這三家聯合門市部在四馬路上，以前曾引起讀者的注意，因爲，在各書局的書籍還均照實價發售的時候，三家的門市部即標出「木版」例七折，外版八折」的長年廉價辦法了，自然有許多讀者，跑到他們那裏去，不過，不久，四馬路上有門市部的各家，囚營業影響，紛紛不再發書，同時，「新書對折」也隨之成爲普遍的風氣。</p>
<p>這三家書店可說是「家庭書店」的典型，他們小規模的做着，即在編輯上與營業上也很少分工，靜觀時機，看中了機會，即出這樣一二本適應時機的書，有時候，也正中鵠的，如國聯調查團報告書及墨素里尼自傳等書，都是營業還不鉗，不過，在究極上說，他們還不能說是出版家，而是販賣家。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c165">著作家的揩油法種種 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 祖舜</p>
<p>從前章克標寫過文壇登龍術，公開了成名秘訣，但章先生終於失敗到登分類廣告求職業，可知戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同，用之不得其法，還甚不能成功的。現在我再來介紹幾種隨手的小戲法，玩起來或者比那大套的要容易些。</p>
<p>一，一舉兩得　一個未成宅的作家辛苦地寫成了或譯成了一本書，當然想賣給書局去出版，然而百分之九十九，你不會找到買主，那麼就得應用這個辦法，請一位已成名的領銜，把你的名字放在他的後面，這樣一來，他會替你找出版的地方，成功了，你分一半稿費給他就是。而且你當然不應該心痛，以爲你只得到一半的酬勞，因爲沒有他，你連這一半也永遠！永遠得不到的。</p>
<p>二，過河拔橋　倘使你讀到一本書，裏面有甚麼名著孤本上引來的章節，應該牢記在心，一有機會就該設法引用，但千萬不可聲明是從那一本書上轉引來的，因爲這樣就太不經濟了。你得祇註出那原書的名字，須章節頁數件件叙明，如果那本書是意大利文，拉丁文，印度文時，千萬要把原文一字一字抄下，懂得也好，不懂得也好，這方法一方面既顯出你博學多才，一方面又可以使讀者敬重你是一個誠實的著作家。</p>
<p>從英文日文轉譯俄文意文的著作而不注明譯本的也可算此法之一種。</p>
<p>三，避重就輕　這第三種揩油方法和第二種差不多，不過只限於洋文的。有許多名著因爲篇幅太鉅，或者因爲原本不易覓得，沒機會過目，好在外國有許多專門做摘要和詳細的評諭介紹的雜誌，你每月定閱幾份就賽如讀原文一般，高興的時候譯下幾段，祇不詫明是譯的，還是自己寫的，或者糊裏糊塗註上「節譯」二字，使得人家不明白究竟你是從原文裏節下來的還是從節文裏節下來的。這方法的妙處在你可以在心地純潔的讀者心裏漸漸築起博學的影象，而捉狹的人找不到你的把柄。</p>
<p>四，移花接本　你看到人家寫的文章，引證詳盡，哲理新穎，而有動於中時可以應用這一套法子，你可以自己寫一篇接近這僩題目的文章，把听有引證考據一個個都引用進去，這樣你的大作後面便也可開列五六十倏註解和參考書，誰能不佩服你學問淵博，又誰能知道原來你祇讀了一篇短文章，而且這個方法絕對沒有危險，即使被人發現了，他也只能冷笑一會，决不能判你一個沙襲的罪名。</p>
<p>五，反客爲主　胡適之博士說他做翻譯工作每小時只能得三四百字，可知這工作實在不容易幹，眞是吃力不討好，一方而你無論做得如何好，總有可以給人們批評的地方，另一方面化了這許氣力，只做了一個介紹人，人家總說威爾斯的世界史綱不錯，不會說某某等人譯的世界史綱眞好。這樣，辛苦艱難的事情，有時碰到一句一字沒有辦法，吃飯走路的時候，你也要搖頭擺腦的轉念頭，然而結果你得了幾元一千的稿費就沒有下文，豈不可憐，但是要自著，本書，實在也不容易，所以不如改譯爲編，找幾本書來東一節西半章拼起來，譯不過來的索性不要，豈不爽快。如果你胆子小，你可以在序文或跋裏註上這麼一句話「本書取材於××的××一書爲多」就一些危險也沒有了。最近有一位先生翻出」本日本出版的工程上的手冊，連印刷上的錯誤都一式一樣，但序文裏地却說這一類書中國人編的這還是第一冊，他的勇敢，眞使我們不能不佩服了。</p>
<p>揩油方法當然還很多，但是上面的幾種只要應用的人心黑皮厚，决沒有危險。讀者如不能領悟，我還可以供給種種實例來給你做參考。</p>
<h3 id="c166">全金屬眞空管 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 醒士</p>
<p>現在市上的眞空管式樣雖多，他們的外壳却一律是用玻璃做成的。玩過收音機的人都知道，在許多的裝置中，眞空管外面，非加一個金屬隔離罩，不能得到優美的成績，這樣不但耗費金錢，並且將收音機的地位增大不少，但是，現在可好了，美國已經發明了一種全金屬的眞空管，這個發明勢必替將來眞空管製造上開闢一條新路。</p>
<p>這稱眞空管除了在引綫通出的地方用玻璃珠絕緣外，其餘全部用金屬做成。他的體積比現在用玻璃做外壳的小得多，並且無疑地也要牢固些。因爲金屬的壳子製造容易，所以成本也可喊低。這種眞空管散熟容易，隔離成績優美，不久一定能够取今日眞空管的地位而代之。</p>
<p>這種新管子的金屬外壳爲圓柱形，上面一段直徑略爲小些。高放管的柵極也在頂端。各極引出的綫先穿過一佃小玻璃球，加熱鎔住。在金屬殼土引綫通出的地方先鑽有小孔，孔的四週放着一種新的合金（鐵鎳和鈷三種金屬合成），呌做佛尼哥（Fernico），他的澎漲係數和玻璃完全一樣，這一點很重要，可以說是這種眞空管所以成功的一個主因。將玻璃珠放在孔口，一併鎔合，因爲有了那種合金，所以玻璃珠和金屬壳可以很牢固地接合，不致受熱破碎。</p>
<p>眞空管裏面的引綫短而直，所以對於短波更是合宜，他的體積也因此减小。並且金屬外壳因製造上的便利，可興內部各極靠得很近，把裏而的屏柵電容量大爲喊小，約當現在眞空管的三分之一，所以眞空管的放大倍數可以境高，而不致生不穩定的危險。</p>
<p>金屬壳的本身和地綫述接，所以加隔離罩的麻煩可以根本免除。眞空管的脚數，也因爲金屬壳接地的綠故，要比現在同類的管子多一隻。</p>
<p>現在這種全金屬眞空管已有十種，其中有六種已由亞爾西愛公司大量製造。有一種是二極雙攣管，兩個二極管的陰極各自分開，中間且加以隔離，但是牠的高度却祇有八分之五吋，比現在的眞空管小得多了。</p>
<h3 id="c167">自動雜聲鎭壓 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>大凡收音機眞空管數愈多，靈敏度愈高，則收音機雜聲亦愈强。此項雜聲的來源，有時旣非受大氣層天電及人造靜電之騷擾，亦非因收音機內部機件，或有損壞所致，例如電子在導綫上衝擊行動，以及眞空管內的電子放射等，均足以造成此項無法避免雜聲的主因。當收音機一開，音樂尚未調整着，嘶嘶的雜聲，已充斥盈耳，實在令人不快。好在無綫電學術的進展，無時無刻不在使難題獲到圓滿的解决，本文所述的自動雜聲鎭壓（Automatie　noise　Suppression　）也是最新成功之一。</p>
<p>完成自動雜聲鎭壓作用的主要機件，仍脫不了無綫電心臟的眞空管。其基本原理，係藉檢波管的整流作用，使產生一控制電壓供給至另一專設的控制眞空管，此控制管的效用，可使收音機在未調整至訊號電壓輸入時，其成音週率放大部分，完全停止工作。設外來訊號載波一至，控制管立刻自動爲成音週率級，恢復原來的任務，放送優美節目，所以自動雜聲鎭壓裝置，實與自動音量控制，同爲高貴收音機不可缺少的條件。此控制管通常卽專稱之爲雜聲鎭壓控制管（Noise　Suppression　Ccntrol　Tube）亦有筒稱之爲Q管者。</p>
<p>圖示最簡明的自動隻聲鎭壓綫路，V1一兩極管利用整流原理的檢波器；V2係三極管，卽用之以作自動雜聲鎭壓者；V3係被控制的成音週率放大管。</p>
<p>當輸又變壓器未受到外來訊號時，V1無屏流流行，卽無負電壓供給至V2棚極，所以R2上經過的屏流最大，此極大屏流，使V3產生一極高負電壓以供給至V3柵極，足使V1屏流截止，完全失去放大效用，此時收音機的成音週率級卽已受鎭壓，不能工作。設訊號輸入，V2產生屏電流，R上兩端，卽有直流及成音週率電壓存在，此直流電壓可供給至V2，以增加其棚負位，使屏流截止，R2無電壓降存在，此時R上的成音週率訊號電壓，經C4饋至V3棚極，因V3棚負壓極低，故已能盡放大之責。</p>
<p>自動雜聲鎭壓與自動音量控制的作用原理，雖同爲變更放大管的柵極電壓，惟所異者，前者係屬成音週率級，後者係高過率或中間週率級。</p>
<h3 id="c168">預防低週率放大所發生狂呌的方法 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 翁焱火</p>
<p>低週率放大的狂呌是從放大器產生低週率振盪所致；因變壓器的鐵心綫圈含有相當之分佈電容量和自戚量，形成振盪電路，受到接綫的磁電作用向靜電作用，而生振盪，雖振盪初音甚小，經放大後則成刺耳的狂呌。茲簡述其預防方法如后：</p>
<p>（一）柵路宜牢接，宜短，愈短愈好。</p>
<p>（二）用耗阻放大，不易起振盪。</p>
<p>（三）位置須排得適當。</p>
<p>（四）若用變壓器放大，宜把變壓器分開、使鐵心互成直角：更或將金屬罩隔離之。</p>
<p>（五）可裝一個〇〇一—〇〇二小法拉特的固定電容器在第二級放大的柵路和燈絲問。</p>
<p>（六）任何接綫都宜短。</p>

<p>— 陳斌輝</p>
<p>現在市面上有一種鑑別炎質耗阻歐姆數的旋盤，售價約四五角·但是看上去好像是仇貨，所以作者逕回家來，照他樣子，做了一隻，使用起來倒很便利準確，而日製法非常簡單，何妨大家手製一隻，以備不時之需，並以挽回金錢的外溢。今將詳細製造列後：</p>
<p>材料卡紙一方（或較堅厚白紙）</p>
<p>顏料七色（或彩色紙剪貼亦可）</p>
<p>二十四號漆包綫少許</p>
<p>先將卡紙剪成如圖一，照虛綫對摺，幷如圖剪成三個扇形孔，再照圖二剪成甲·乙·丙·三個圓形卡紙，如圖劃分若干格，幷註明歐姆數字，染以各種顏色，一切均已詳註圖中，不復贅述。</p>
<p>最後以漆包綫如圖釘好，以便轉旋，於是一隻簡單而實用的耗阻鑑別盤，就此告成，如圖三。</p>
<p>現在譬如有一隻全身棕色，頭黑色，中點橙色的耗阻、我們將「全身」字樣上面的格子裏旋成棕色，「頭」字上的格子旋成黑色，「中點」字上的格子旋成橙色，如圖，我們就可以知道這電阻是一〇〇〇〇歐姆了。</p>

<p>— 何鳳</p>
<p>無綫電收音機的接綫，不免要用錫焊，川錫焊通常是分兩種，一種是用松香，一種是用鹽化鋅，（俗名鏹水）用鹽化鋅的工作很容易，用松香比較要熟手才行，但是用監化鋅來焊許多業餘家公認是有弊無利的，因爲鹽化焊受了烙鐵的熱，炸的一聲，四面粉飛，很容易使器具腐蝕，倘若擦洗不凈，經久以後，因化學的變化，發生綠色，甚致使所焊的地方漸漸腐壞，阻止收音工作，用松香焊就無此弊，然而松香比較難些，現經業餘經騐所得，將松香擊成粉末，置於「凡士林」（西藥房有售）內，使之勻和，隔水略蒸片刻，然後使用，甚爲便利，且與市上所有出售之焊劑效能無異，諸君有暇，不妨一試。</p>

<p>南宋臨安，有劉貴者，字君薦，妻王氏，妾陳氏，一日，携其妻往祝妻父壽，妻父王翁，以其貧也，予錢十五貫，使營什一，留女而遺婿先歸。途遇其友，同飲而醉，及歸，妾見所負錢，問其故，劉貴醉後，戲之曰：吾因家貧，不能共活，已賃汝於人矣，此賃錢也。明日當送汝去，言已就枕，卽入睡鄕。妾思告知其父母，乃至鄰人朱三老家，告以故，且寄宿矣，黎明卽行。而劉貴固熟睡未醒，有賊入其家，竊其錢，劉驚覺，起而追之，適地下有斧，賊卽取斧殺劉，盡負錢去。次日，鄰人見其門久不啟，入視得狀，朱三老乃言，夜間其妾偕宿事，因共追尋，妾行路未半，力疲少憇。有崔寗者，自城中賣絲，亦得錢十五貫，與之同憇，追者至，幷要之歸，聞方官，謂崔與妾有姦，殺其夫竊貲偕亡也，竟尸於市，後其妻以夫死家貧，其父王翁使人迎之歸，途遇大雨，避入林中，爲盜所得，據爲妻，偶言及數年事，妻乃知殺其夫者，卽此盜也，乘間出告於臨安府，事乃白。</p>
<p>按此事與十五貫崑劇絕相似，殆後人欲表揚况靑天廉明，乃以此事衍爲之耳</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>大約在上一個星期二吧？我爲了一伴朋友的案子，開始審問，一方面要去旁聽一下；同時，更要使我這個初出茅廬的小子，增加一些經騐起見，於是便趨車直達南市地方法院，到院之後，因爲時間尚早，便在該院的候審室里，等待了一個多鐘頭。</p>
<p>候審室，這是一個多麼可怕而神聖，威嚴的地方呀？何况是法院的候審室，尤其使人戚到另有一種情調。</p>
<p>當我在候審室里等候的時候，這里待審的人們，已經很多，而且還有許多陸續而來的呢？如果拿男女的性別來統計一下，那末，男性是佔了十分之八，而女性僅僅是佔十分之二而已。</p>
<p>我坐在候審室里，細細地觀察許多行將候審的人們有的是愁眉不展好像是有偌大的禍患，臨到他的身上似的；有的在竊竊私議，討論怎樣應付法官的詢問？有的是沉思不語，好像在懺悔自己的錯誤似的，尤其使我發生無限的感慨的，便是被告與原告的同在一室，表面上看來，見面時仍然握手道好，而實際各人的腦海中，正在計劃怎樣的對付你呢？唉！這虛偽而可怕的社會，這里，又給予人們一個深刻的暗示！</p>
<p>總而言之，法院是威嚴的，候審室是最最容易使人發生感想的，在那里，我想起朱柏廬先生所說的「訟則終凶」這句話，實任是不錯的。</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>最近，我住的衖裏，有一位六十三歲的老先生，續娶了一位二十五歲的少女。這一伴事，幾乎引起了全衖裏的人們的注意。於是有很多愛管閒事的人，便都沒命的刺探着這一家的一切消息，作爲談話的資料。</p>
<p>這位六十三歲的老先生，是曾當過一程子甚麼稅所所長的，所以手裏是有着相當的資產。去年，他的老伴死了，他戚到寂寞，於是經人介紹，而娶了這位某女校的高材生。這位老先生的後妻，却比了他的大兒子年靑着十七歲。他的小兒子，也比了這位後母，長着四歲呢。</p>
<p>某一天，在筵席上，這位老先生，帶着六七分醉意，發表他的娶這麼一位年靑的太太的動機來了：「你們儘不用對於我的婚事，大驚小怪。我這麼一大把年紀了，活一天，算是二個半天。我自然也不希望身後還有人給我守節，所以我就和這麼一位曾受敎育的年靑的女子結婚。我活一天，她和我同居一天。我二脚一挺，就不愁她不會自尋出路。」</p>
<p>同時呢，他的夫人也偷偷地對她的同學說：「這麼着，我就不愁得不到遺產，這不比了離婚而强索膽養費的强麼？他今年已是六十三歲了，而且身子也是不怎麼健朗的，我守上幾年，得了遺產，我還愁不能發展麼？」</p>
<p>老夫有老夫的心事，少妻有少妻的主張，這麼的一種結合，我覺得倒是再也合適不過的。</p>

<p>第十五回　苦口婆心不平空拍案錢聲燈影可憐正賣人</p>
<p>志前說時，胡小脚臉上，是慢慢的變色，最後他鼻子聳了兩下，息息牽牽的，哭起來了。他掀起一片衣襟，擦着眼淚道；你老爺說的，不都是實情麼？我也就想了兩天，拿不出一點主意來。那個楊小姐又會說，他說得處處都有理，我讓他說動了心就說試試看，也沒有說一定就可以辦得成。志前道：你且不要哭，他說些什麼呢？也許他說得是對的，你說給我聽聽。胡嫂子把眼淚擦乾了，這就微搖了兩搖頭道：你老爺一說破，我也就不信他的話了。他說：姨太太總是老爺喜歡的。只要姑娘嫁過去了之後，在老爺面前撒撒嬌，不怕老爺不養活丈母娘。就是老爺把他帶南方去了，他可以常常寫信來，只要有錢，把他娘和奶奶接去也可以，自己回西安來看看也可以。不久，火車就要通到西安了，火車來往，那是很便當的。他這樣說的，是很好聽的。不過我想着，恐怕沒有這樣容易的事。現在程老爺一說，人心都是肉做的麼，那又那裏捨得呢？不過那楊小姐也太會說，他一說，我就糊塗了。北海自打碎了那隻茶杯，怪難爲情的，許久沒有作聲。遠就揷嘴道：我雖不能像程光生那樣說的週到，可是我也覺得你也不至於等着賣人過日子。你回去商量商量，你走別路罷。他說話時，臉可不向着胡嫂子，似乎他心裏很有些不安。（二五二）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>那末這個病將怎樣診法呢？祇有省略了望氣色的一步，直接按脈了。其時太后的御座的兩邊，已設下了兩張小小的方几，几上鋪着一重軟墊，待到那四位御醫恭恭敬敬地如數的　足了九個頭之後，太后便吩咐另外兩個女官，把伊附個衣袖捲起了一半來，讓伊自己仍在中間的御座上端坐着，而把伊的左右兩臂，分擱在兩邊的小儿上。於是那四位御醫便膝行而前，一直行近到那兩張小几邊去；同時又有兩位女官巳把兩方很薄的組帕把太后的手臂覆住了，因爲像太后這樣尊貴的人，豈能隨便讓不相干的人沾及伊的皮膚的！四位御醫便分着兩邊，每一邊各兩人，十分謹愼地伸出手來，用指尖隔着絹帕，靜心爲太后按脈。論到按脈，這一種診病的方法實在是很神秘的！他們旣不用時錶來計算脈搏的次數，僅憑五個手指頭按着，怎麼就能知道病人的病情呢？我從前總是詫爲神異的，—至今也還不曾明白。</p>
<p>隔了半嚮，左右兩邊的御醫便又悄悄地互相對調了過去；但他們是始終不敢向太后偷覷一眼的，儘管在事實上他們知道應該有一番瞧瞧病人的舌苔的手續，或者太后自己也不致拒絕，但他們總是很謹愼的，那裏敢冒冒失失地要求</p>
<p>太后的舌頭呢？他們並且竭力的要閃避太后的視綫，就是在按脈的時候，也故意把頭側過一些，像是根畏羞的樣子。（三五二）</p>

<h3 id="c185">東門掌舊 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>往日，上海還有城的時候，臨靠黃浦江的那一邊是東門。大東門呌做朝宗門，是在如今肇嘉路的東端；小東門在大東門的北面，呌做寶帶門，是在如今方浜路的東端，走過城隍廟正門再朝東跑跑就到啦。</p>
<p>上海老早就是個國際貿易市場，番舶沓至。那時候當然沒有什麼現在的租界區域，市場以縣城區爲中心，商船從黃浦江裏瀉進來，東門外就成了碼頭的焦點。大東門，小東門，可就熱鬧得了不得啦。</p>
<p>淸朝康熙二十三年，廢除海禁，次年，上海就設海關，名稱呌做「江海大關」，牠坐鎭在小東門外東北，面對黃浦；貨船進港，必得擦過牠身邊，正是扼要隘的地方。</p>
<p>現在民國路外，貫通太古路和舟山路間，有一條「洋行街」。說起這條街的歷史，就很長久了，考嘉慶十九年修的上海縣志，卷一縣城圖及卷六坊巷，都已載了這條街名；從此可以證明洋行街决非五口通商以後才有的，而開埠之先，上海洋行的繁盛，也就可想而知了。在嘉慶時代，洋行街是從小東門外，朝北直通海關大街：而且有裏洋行街與外洋行街，兩條是並行的。現在則祇賸一條了。</p>
<p>道光二十三年，上海依據南京條約開闢爲條約商埠，接漪有英法居留民地在城北相繼劃定，南市商業，稍稍奪北。上海道乃在北鬥外頭壩的地方另建一所關署（道光二十六年立），稱爲北關，又稱新關，而小東門的大關就此變做南關或老關了。</p>
<p>法僑居留地初劃定時，東面的南端僅至新開河，而新開河之性質，乃等於「界洪」（Detence　Creek）。到了咸豐十一年九月，法僑居留地第一次推廣，他們是看中了沿浦地域的重要性，故屢施威脅，乃獲擴充它居留地的東南，在新開河下面仲出一條舌頭，直到十六舖止。，那時候，小東門竟對着法僑居留地了，洋行街也舐在那條仲出的舌頭上了。</p>
<p>城外十六舖以北劃進了法僑居留地後，老關怎樣啦？不要緊，老關老早就搬到大東門了，因爲小東門的關署在咸豐十年被太平天國軍隊燬去後，就改至大東門救生局內辦公的。</p>
<p>法僑居留地的舌頭上，後來又建築了許多條公路，用中國的地名來給它們題名，如台灣路舟山路，福建路，很有趣味的，這些路名和英僑居留地內的路名都重複起來了。前面提到的太古路，亦作大沽路，又成爲上海的重複路名之一。</p>
<p>外僑居留地的路政日修，市面日盛，上海當局感覺非急起直追不可了，在光緒二十二年，上海縣開始把大東門外的漲灘地築成大路，名外馬路；後來又在外馬路西邊築裏馬路。通衢旣已興建，市面自然也追蹤英法居留地的黃浦灘了。大東門外的漲灘地仲入江心，所以，外馬路並不與外僑居留地直貫，反而是裏馬路啣接着法外灘。不常跑東門的朋友，要去找所謂「中國外灘」（Chinese　Bund）時，得打聽打聽淸楚啦。</p>

<p>病從口入，飲食之於健康，關係至鉅。講究衛生的人，平時對於食物，皆知注意。特別是在夏季，各種傳染病盛行，一切食料飲品，更須格外留心。暑天一到，因爲氣侯炎熱，食物很容易腐壞。且蒼蠅紛飛。亦爲霍亂的媒介物。故飲食偶一不愼，發生疾病，勢所難免。這不但於人身健康有碍，有時還有生命之虞。至如市上販賣的夏令飲料，如冰水，酸梅湯，汽水，菓子露等，類多不合衛生者，我們尤不可不加倍留意。</p>
<p>今夏本市衛生局，對於預防傳染病，十分努力。自交夏以來，卽舉行全市防疫注射，及各處溝渠的消毒工作。最近又鑒於市上各商家出售的牛乳及凉飲品，飲者甚衆，非時時予以嚴密的檢查，難免有劣品混充發賣，致妨碍人民的健康？故特分別收集，令飭衛生試騐所，詳加檢查。牛乳一類，本月內經查騐七家·每公撮的細菌數太多，不合規定標準，已嚴令注意淸潔，切實消毒。並聞將向飲戶弔取檢查，以臻周密。凉飲料一類，現已檢騐汽水二十一種，合格的，僅有二種。查騐菓子露四十四種，合格的亦祇有二種。又檢查酸梅水三揮，無一合格者。其不合格的，皆因細菌過多，不合市定標準。如雜有病菌，則飲者尤易得病。現巳由衛生局，通知不合格各製造廠，令切實改良，以便再騐。</p>
<p>從衛生局這次施行檢騐的結果，我們發見現今市上所售的飲料，不合衛生的實居多數。一般市民，應萬分注意，格外留心。</p>

<p>— 凈夫</p>
<p>「韓山之麓湘橋東……」像這樣壯美的歌聲，當牠隱約的飄上腦海來時，我彷彿還辯別出這是從年靑人的豪放的音調中奏起的呵！牠，輕輕的喚起我像那歌聲一樣的情調聲色的年靑人的靈魂的跳盪，喚起那已消逝得迷離如夢的景物的舞映……</p>
<p>「韓山之麓湘橋東……」這是一隻約莫七八年前爲我們一羣年靑人所常舞跳高歌的歌：可是，而今我只能記住這開</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>始的一句。這可以見到幾年來生活的鞭子擊得舊夢粉碎的痕跡吧！然而，這麼僅殘留在記憶中的一句、却够活盡出當年的情景。</p>
<p>登韓山而望，一條悠長婉曲而浩茫荘美的韓江，繞着叢密的潮城。騰騰欲躍的城，荘茫遠飄的江，烟水相映，景物活若婆娑起舞的美人。目　遠流飄去，西南面一帶沙灘雪白，羣鳥在戲。灘與水之下，又接竹林蕭　、終日飄搖的大竹國：那是個有名的江邊的小島，神色輕靈凈飄，大有出塵之慨。竹林遙對之處·高聳矗立的可溪塔·蒼蒼鬱鬱·古老雄渾，遠望而氣魄猶覺襲人。曁然反目，俯對湘子橋，整齊而輕飄美麗，直如橫空之虹，橋上人殆如妙畫上物，隱約不淸；但却脈脈而來、遙遙以去；橋邊橋下，江之左右，漪漣如錦的綠波，羣舟戲水上，望之不免神馳。慢慢點着徘過江東來的景物，以至臨江而接的韓山麓，嘆了一口甜適的閒氣，便覺渾身輕鬆了！抬頭把目光縦之浩空，雄風迎面吹來，少年人的氣概躍然，搖頭高歌、眞像如在夢中。</p>
<p>踏靑山、援綠木，聽鳥啼，處濃蔭下，撫潺潺如奏曲的淸流，索性把雖當學生，却常喜赤足拖木展的雙脚，浸進凉水中，活像小孩子，不知有天地呢！那是我的靑春的靈魂，那是我十幾歲時的美夢！</p>
<p>漫遊得疲倦，徘徊到宿舍，左側的古祠的鐘聲，悠揚散盪在這幽美的山麓、聽了心神分外淸淨。這又教我想起了山上有這教化潮人的韓愈的韓文公祠，所以名呌韓山。從湘子橋踏過，拾上斜的石級而登，上面巍巍站在的古祠，秀雅淸靜的伴的徐來的淸風，牆外老松，香花，黑瓦頂各種婉轉自鳴的鳥兒。我愛坐在祠前的凉石上袒露雅胸，看遊人，望韓山，看湘子橋，四週盡楚陶醉的、淸幽的氣氛圍住着。祠旁的石碑上，有那沉黑券勁，雄渾蒼老的刻諸石上的韓愈蘇東坡、等古人的字跡。不時竟還有些洋人來觀玩呢！看着那石上迹、又沉在懷古的情調中去。</p>
<p>每當夏夜，嶺南的月色，照着這韓山麓，年靑人的情趣更異常馳躍。銀皎雪白的月色，照遍了深幽濃蔭淸靜的山間，樹林下，雅緻的校園，沉息秀雅的臼色宿舍，窗戶，房子內，都點綴着醉人的月色，使韓山麓的景物，實更美化起來。、於是，飄飄不能靜止的心神、自然會躍然而動。踏出宿舍門，漫步，隨坐淤凉石上，樹下樹枝上。追着遠望迷離欲化的山上的美色，總不覺雖近午夜，而意興正沉。便倒臥在淸凉甜息的亭上，放膽恣睡，呼吸着簡直爽得覺有非人間所具的淸甜欲醉的味道。有時雖月已西沉，將近殘夜，而更給迷離的氣色迷住呵！</p>
<p>想起這些，我又猛憶着去年重新夜宿韓山麓、景物雖如舊，我的心却散亂得不堪一顧韓山麓的面目。而一宿過後，便忽忽的忍不住走了！那一顆年靑的心，早就給埋葬了呵！</p>

<p>— 葉城</p>
<p>大哥，鄉下恐怕是靑草池塘處處蛙的時候了。</p>
<p>據說都市是季節的敏感者。是的，乳燕從南國歸來的時候，奏着爵士音樂的街頭已經飛揚着夏季大减價的旗幟了。但是鄉下人就不懂得這些嗎？他們的生命是被握在季節的掌握之中的。候鳥唱着的時候，他們播種，現在是我們習慣上的黃霉時節，是應該分秧的時候了。但是從報上讀得各地旱象將成的悄息，多懂得那些我們幾百代祖先遺留下來的經騐，也是枉然的。</p>
<p>我記起去年歸家的影像了，其實牠無時無刻不在我腦神經上反映着；那些田坂像生鐵一樣的堅硬，沿河道　水的聲音，幾乎沒有歇息的時候，眼看河床如魚肚白似的暴露出來，但是田坂里彷彿瀉着水銀一樣，犂鋤打下去的時候，發出金屬的濁音，像一個老年人多喝了酒似的難聽。每一張紫膛的臉失了神采，舉起憤怒的手臂，掌着「猛將」爺泥凋的面頰。那時候都市中的慈善家，想到下一年的糧食問題，終於也搬出張天師來設壇作法。懂得季候的土地之子，仰望着烈日當空的天面，用歎氣作為飯糧似的過日子。</p>
<p>「鄉下沒有一條耕牛了，但是人都像牛一樣地工作着！」你高聲呌起來的時候，幾乎和敵人博鬥的樣子。現在你的聲音你的影子都在我眼前浮現了。</p>
<p>我覺得很慚愧，父親因為我不像一個「莊稼人」的坯子，我們兩個就走了二條不同的路。父親的意思自然很好的，種田人永遠沒有出息，但是變賣了祖上的遺產，把我培植到中學畢業的所謂「讀書人」又怎樣呢？不能如父親預料中的升官發財，似乎可恕的，然而許多年來要填飽自己的肚子，現在是說話都沒有勇氣了呵！讀書人和種田人走的雖然是兩條絕不相同的路，結果是完全使父親失望了。</p>
<p>但是上一代人是知道逆來順受的。去年歸家，父親依然把夢也似的希望託付在我身上，他要我忍耐，老矢是有眼晴的，讀書人總有翻身的日子！他那樣笑着把陸狀元在媒油燈下重述給我們聽。</p>
<p>「總有翻身的日子的！」他努力抽着旱烟袋結束了。</p>
<p>大哥，當時我見你翻着血紅的眼球，我知道你已經裝不下那種「忍耐」的哲學了。但是父親是以忍耐為「家訓」的，我們的祖先是忍耐起家的。雖然那天父親送我上船時他是低着沒有說一句話，</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>我知道他惟五的訓話「忍耐」早已要冲口而出了，但是那樣沉默着分別了：或許他對於「忍耐」也不敢擔保它是成功的信條了。</p>
<p>接到你的信的下一天，下雨了，但是水災的消息又傳來。現在季節都失了時序了，自然被握在季節掌握中的鄉下人已不能再忍耐下去了，你說今年像牛一樣工作着人已經放棄了他們祖先遺傳下來的教訓。其實這都是徒然的，都市中敏感的人們正想怎樣來救濟我們的農村呢！你聽了這消息，或者要放聲大笑吧？</p>

<p>(Peiping) This morning, the people of Peiping suddenly heard booming cannon fire, causing panic. Afterwards, the inner and outer cities of Peiping remained closed, preventing vegetable vendors from entering the city. Residents faced great difficulty purchasing vegetables in the early morning. The prices of oil, salt, and other goods in the streets and alleys rose sharply, and rice shops tripled their profits. No trams left the depot this morning, there were few rickshaws, and few pedestrians. Many shops also did not open, resulting in a desolate scene. Traffic was temporarily cut off at Xuanwumen, Hepingmen, Zhengyangmen, Chongwenmen, Tiananmen and other places in the southern city. Newspaper delivery men, vegetable vendors, and rickshaw pullers were completely stopped outside the city, and were only allowed to pass around 10:00 AM, which slightly calmed the people. Few students arrived at the city's elementary schools until noon, resulting in an unofficial holiday. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the sound of cannon fire was heard in Peiping this morning, military police, and other relevant parties were prepared for local security and strengthened the alert. Therefore, order prevailed. The rebels launched the attack from the Fengtai area, threatening armored vehicles and advancing towards Peiping. At the Nan Quekou (South Breach) area outside Yongdingmen, they were intercepted by military police and security forces and immediately retreated towards Fengtai. After being pursued by military police, the bandits in the Fengtai and Yongdingmen train station areas were completely cleared by 10:00 AM this morning, and the situation was restored to normal. A remnant of the bandits abandoned their vehicles and fled eastward across the Baihe River. Our infantry and cavalry units are currently dividing up to intercept them. After the incident occurred, the Peiping local authorities held a meeting all night in a certain location and have devised thorough and stable measures for Peiping's security. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Military dispatch: Around 1:00 AM this morning, several cannon shots were suddenly heard in Peiping, coming from the south. After investigation, it was found that a small group of rebels in Fengtai suddenly attacked our armored vehicle unit, seized the armored vehicles parked there, and forced them to fire towards Yongdingmen, intending to enter the city through the Nan Quekou (South Breach) in the outer city. Our garrison troops at that location intercepted them head-on. The rebel troops were unable to advance and retreated to Yongdingmen train station. Subsequently, our officers and soldiers went out of the city to suppress them. The rebel troops at that location have fled towards Fengtai. The Yongdingmen area has been completely restored to its original state. As for the bandits in the Fengtai area, they have been routed by our troops and are fleeing towards the war zone. Our troops are currently in pursuit. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After 8:00 AM this morning, pedestrians were allowed to pass through the streets and traffic was restored. All shops opened and resumed business as usual. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A total of seven cannon shots were heard inside the city this morning. One landed at the Hongwen Apartment in Dongjingjidao, one on the earthen mound in Erlongkeng, one at the former Jingjidao Art Academy, and one at No. 25 Baozi Street, none of which exploded. The whereabouts of the other two shots were not determined. The local military, police, and gendarmerie authorities are jointly maintaining order in Peiping, ensuring safety. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Locations where cannonballs landed this morning: (1) Four iron balls with a diameter of five fen landed in the Hongbin Apartment in Dongjingjidao. Another large ball blasted a large pit one or two chi long and one chi deep in front of the north-facing room's door. (2) A pit about two chi wide and deep was blasted on the mound in front of No. 10 Shanggangmen. (3) Two relatively large iron balls landed at the former Jingjidao Art Academy, knocking down a piece of brick from the flower window of the lower floor. (4) An iron ball landed in front of the south-facing room's door at No. 31 Shoupa Hutong. (Special dispatch, 11/18)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the incident outside Yongdingmen was quelled this morning, police inspection revealed three people struck by stray bullets: Li Wenfu and Jia Wanchun, both injured and sent to the municipal hospital for treatment. There was also one dead person whose name is unknown. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) An official announcement stated that around 1:00 AM this morning, plainclothes soldiers in Fengtai attacked and seized an armored vehicle, forcing the driver to drive it towards Peiping. The soldiers guarding the city resisted. The rebel troops eventually retreated to Fengtai. The rebel soldiers in Fengtai have now been routed and have fled into the demilitarized zone. Five cannonballs landed in the city. The military police are maintaining order in Peiping, and there is absolutely no danger. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military authorities here are currently consulting with commanders of foreign troops to discuss joint actions in the event that the Peiping disturbance spreads. A Japanese spokesperson here stated today that the Japanese do not consider this matter to be serious. The Peiping-Tianjin Railway has been suspended for some time, and the Blue Steel Train has also been unable to run. Telephone communications at the Fengtai Station were cut off last night but are currently being repaired. There are rumors here that an armored vehicle came from Peiping to Tianjin. It is unknown whether this vehicle belongs to the rebel troops, and the public is quite worried. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Peiping implemented a sudden curfew at 11:00 PM on the 27th, cutting off all traffic in the city. The reason given was that Bai Jianwu, a former subordinate of Wu Peifu, was commanding 2,000 bandits in an attempt to seize Peiping by force, but this plan was exposed before it could be realized. (Japanese United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At noon on the 28th, the military authorities here received a telegram from Peiping reporting that at around 1:00 AM on the 28th, when the 10th parcel train on the Beijing-Hankou Railway arrived at Fengtai Station, over a hundred plainclothes bandits with short guns got off the train. Taking advantage of the crowd of passengers, they rushed into the armored vehicle of the 6th squadron stationed at Fengtai Station, claiming to be organizing a "North China State" with Bai Jianwu as the commander-in-chief of the Righteous Autonomous Army. At the same time, they coerced the armored vehicle unit to fire five cannons at Yongdingmen in Peiping (one shell exploded in the air, four did not explode, and none injured anyone). The Peiping garrison immediately dispatched troops to meet and severely attack them. The bandit troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Fengtai. Our armored vehicle unit and infantry then cooperated to track down and suppress them. By 11:00 AM, all the bandits in the Fengtai area had been defeated and fled eastward. There were no traces of bandits in Fengtai. Traffic between Peiping and Tianjin was restored this afternoon. Peiping is calm and peaceful as usual. The city and outside are under extremely strict guard, and security can be ensured. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11/18)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The course of the plainclothes bandit disturbance in Fengtai on the evening of the 27th, according to investigations, is as follows: The 6th Squadron of armored vehicles was originally stationed in Fengtai to maintain railway traffic. Some of the officers and soldiers within were reorganized from Shi Yousan's former railway protection force. Because the officers were mostly in Peiping and no one supervised them, the bandits took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack. In addition to sending 30-40 people to sneak into Fengtai beforehand, the remaining 80-odd people arrived at Fengtai on the 10th train from Tianjin on the evening of the 27th. At 0:40 AM on the 11/18, they seized the armored vehicles. At the time, the soldiers were cooling off under the vehicles, caught off guard, and were seized by the bandits, forced to drive the vehicles and fire cannons, and advance towards Yongdingmen, intending to enter through the breach in the outer city. The bandits all had the words "Pseudo Righteous Autonomous Army" wrapped around their left arms. The Peiping Public Security Bureau received a telephone report from Fengtai at 12:00 AM after the vehicle moved, and immediately notified the military, police, and gendarmerie authorities, dispatching military police to suppress them. At the same time, a temporary curfew was announced throughout the city. At 1:15 AM, the bandits forced their way into the outer city, and our defending soldiers intercepted them head-on. The bandits were unsuccessful and retreated to Yongdingmen Station. Half an hour later, our officers and soldiers went out of the city to suppress them. The bandits, realizing the disparity in numbers, fled back to Fengtai. At this time, our officers and soldiers, fearing that the bandits would return, had no choice but to dismantle a section of the railway south of Yongdingmen Station to prevent the bandits from advancing. By dawn on the 28th, the officers and soldiers had again scattered the remaining bandits in Fengtai, killing more than 20. There were still 50-60 people who fled eastward from Fengtai, intending to harass the area south of Tongxian and around Yanjiao. Our army is currently dispatching teams to pursue and suppress them. When the bandits were causing trouble in Fengtai, they cut off the railway bureau's telegraph and telephone lines, temporarily cutting off communications. Peiping's security relied on the effective maintenance of order by the military, police, and gendarmerie, and remained peaceful as usual. Wang Shuchang, Shao Wenkai, Yuan Liang, and Yu Jinhe all stayed up all night, personally directing operations, and sandbags were placed at all important locations for strict security. The curfew was lifted and the situation restored to normal only after receiving reports at 9:30 AM on the 28th that the bandits had been defeated. Traffic between Peiping and Tianjin was restored in the afternoon. The Military Council held an emergency meeting at 8:00 AM on the 28th, attended by Bao Wenxue, Hu Yukun, Ji Yiqiao, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Wang Shuchang, etc., where they discussed maintaining security. After the meeting, they sent telegrams to President Wang, Chairman Chiang, and Acting Chairman He, reporting on everything. Yuan Liang also telegraphed the capital detailing the course of events. According to a certain authority, the number of bandits was small and they have been scattered by the officers and soldiers. In addition to ordering constant vigilance, Peiping's security is absolutely guaranteed, and merchants and residents can remain calm. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11/18)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese military staff officer Omaki Yoshihisa visited Shang Zhen, the commander of the Tianjin Garrison Security Headquarters, on the 28th to discuss security issues in Tianjin. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) At 9:00 AM this morning, order was fully restored in Peiping. Most shops opened as usual. The gates of the inner city were opened around 9:00 AM, and the gates of the outer city, except for Yongdingmen, were allowed to open to traffic around 10:00 AM. All government offices and banks conducted business as usual. After the disturbance occurred, all traffic on the Peiping-Shenyang section of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway was suspended. Westbound trains stopped at Langfang, and eastbound trains were not dispatched, resulting in a desolate scene at the platforms. The 41st Peiping-Shijiazhuang train on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which departed at 7:00 AM this morning, returned to the West Station due to the closure of the city gates. The 1st Peiping-Hankou special express train at 10:20 AM has departed on schedule. Long-distance telephone service between Peiping and Tianjin is operating normally. The Beijing-Shenyang Railway dispatched a track inspection train around 1:00 PM this afternoon to explore the route. It is hoped that traffic can be restored this afternoon. The train to Tongzhou, scheduled to depart at 1:40 PM this afternoon, has departed on schedule. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The leader of the Fengtai incident was Bai Jianwu, the former division commander of the Zhili Army, who claimed to be the commander-in-chief of the Righteous Autonomous Army. The plainclothes bandits he recruited were all former subordinates of Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan, as well as Wang Zizhen's unit, Shi Yousan's nephew. After their defeat, they did not disperse but fled to Yanjiao and went into hiding. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 28th, due to the Peiping-Tianjin railway tracks being cut, the Peiping-Pukou train No. 306 had already reached Langfang and returned to Tianjin. The 302 Peiping-Shanghai through train, the 2nd Peiping-Shenyang through train, the 6th Peiping-Liaoning express train, and the 42nd Peiping-Liaoning slow train were all blocked and stopped at Tianjin Main Station. Until the railway tracks were repaired in the afternoon, trains 306, 2nd, and 42nd were separately opened to Peiping at 2:45 PM, 3:10 PM, and 3:40 PM. The 1202nd and 6th passenger and freight trains were attached to these 2nd trains. The remaining trains departed at their original times. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) There are no more traces of bandits in Fengtai, and traffic between Peiping and Tianjin will be restored immediately. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Wang Shuchang, the commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison, said that a bandit disturbance was discovered last night in the Fengtai area, threatening the armored vehicle unit stationed there. They were driven off head-on by the dispatched military police, and they are currently being surrounded and suppressed in the Fengtai area, which can be resolved completely. Proper measures have been planned for Peiping's security, and there is absolutely no problem. The curfew will be lifted as soon as the incident is quelled. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The 726th Regiment of the 141st Division of the 32nd Army, stationed in Liangcheng, is responsible for security in Haixia, Xian Shuigu, Chen Tangzhuang, and other places. Although people felt uneasy all day on the 28th, the city situation was particularly peaceful. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the Fengtai incident occurred, in order to maintain the safety of the city and local security, a curfew was announced today, and a curfew headquarters was established, with Wang Shuchang as the curfew commander and Shao Wenkai as the deputy commander. Starting at 9:00 PM, pedestrians will be inspected. The security of Peiping is the responsibility of the military, police, and gendarmerie and can be expected to be safe. Military and police agencies are stepping up their guard. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said on the 28th that the Fengtai rebels were jointly suppressed by two regiments of Miao Zhengliu's division, and the cavalry team of his own division. Around 12:00 PM, those who retreated to Fengtai abandoned their vehicles and scattered in Huangshipo, and were also surrounded and routed. They are currently being pursued by various units. Peiping declared the lifting of the curfew that afternoon, and there is absolutely no cause for concern about the security of this city. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Huang Shipo Gu, the stationmaster of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, reported that at 12:50 PM on the 28th, he was kidnapped to Nanyuan by a group of bandits. The number of bandits was less than 200. They were defeated in Huangcun, and when they fled, they were extremely disheveled, fleeing from Nanyuan to Tongzhou and then to Yanjiao, Sanhe. The empty armored vehicle cars are currently parked at Huangcun Station. The Huang Shipo stationmaster has been released and has returned to Huangcun. At 1:00 PM on the 28th, a track maintenance train departed from Fengtai to repair the damaged railway tracks between Wanyizhuang and Huangcun. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The 6th Squadron of armored vehicles belonging to the Direct Jurisdiction Military Council is stationed in Fengtai, with the task of protecting the railway. The families of the officers and soldiers all live in the city. Before the incident last night, at 9:00 PM, more than 100 bandits boarded a train from Tianjin, all with white bands wrapped around their inner sleeves. After arriving in Fengtai, they disembarked there. At 12:40 AM, they attacked the 6th Squadron's armored vehicles stationed there. Because there were fewer soldiers on the vehicles, they were unable to resist for a time, and the vehicles were seized by the bandits. After seizing the vehicles, the bandits posted slogans there, calling themselves the Righteous National Salvation Autonomous Army. At the same time, they forced the vehicles to drive towards the city. At 1:05 AM, the vehicle arrived at the South Breach of Yongdingmen. When the vehicle left Fengtai, the Peiping Public Security Bureau received an emergency report and immediately telegraphed the garrison stationed there to stand by. When the vehicle arrived at the South Breach, the iron shed gate had already been closed. The bandits forced the guards to open the gate, and a melee began. The bandits fired three cannons first, then seven more, for a total of ten shots. When the cannons were fired, the telegraph and telephone lines between Peiping and Fengtai were cut by the bandits, and several sections of the railway tracks were also excavated. In the evening, in order to prevent trouble, the city of Peiping remained under curfew from 10:00 PM. Traffic between Peiping and Tianjin, the Peiping-Shanghai through train, and all other trains were fully restored from 3:05 PM this afternoon. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) News of the Fengtai incident arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 28th, and the authorities here immediately mobilized police teams to strengthen security. People's hearts are still at ease. After the Peiping-Pukou train No. 106 returned from Langfang, it departed from Tianjin to Peiping at 2:40 PM. The Peiping-Shenyang through train also arrived in Tianjin from Peiping at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. In addition, all stations in Tianjin implemented a curfew at 8:00 PM on the 28th, with increased security at all important roads. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The temporary curfew order in Peiping was lifted at noon on the 28th. However, rumors abound, and people's hearts are wavering. It was only after learning that Bai Jianwu's troops had been repelled by Shang Zhen's troops tonight that peace was restored in the city. (Electric News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin is under special curfew from 9:00 PM tonight due to the influence of Peiping. (Electric News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Peiping was suddenly attacked by rebel bandits last night. How many rebels were there? What were their aims? Who was in command? It is not yet possible to ascertain these things. There was booming cannon fire at night, and cannonballs landed in the streets, giving the capital the appearance of being besieged. There was fighting in various parts of Peiping, the most prominent being near Yongdingmen, where the troops and security forces bravely resisted the rebels. The armored vehicles possessed by the rebels advanced along the southwest city and fired cannons at the defending soldiers. It is reported that one civilian was killed by cannon fire. At that time, all twelve city gates of Peiping were closed and barricades were set up for defense, and a curfew was announced with traffic completely suspended. Last night's disturbance began in Fengtai, which is on the Peiping-Hankou line, seven miles from Peiping. Approximately 350 to 2,000 rebels occupied Fengtai Station and advanced towards Peiping. Outside Yongdingmen, the troops under Wan Fulin refused them entry, and the two sides opened fire, with cannon fire erupting intermittently. At 7:30 AM, armored vehicles formerly belonging to Yu Xuezhong but recently transferred to Wan Fulin arrived from Fengtai and bombarded the defending troops. The defending troops retaliated with mortars, machine guns, and rifles. The defending troops at the South Gate used mortars to destroy the railway tracks under the armored vehicles, and the armored vehicles advanced along the west city, firing into the city. After the fighting started, the Peiping authorities immediately mobilized reinforcements and dismantled the railway tracks between Peiping and Fengtai to cut off the armored vehicles' route of advance and retreat. The rebel troops were repelled and retreated towards Fengtai. The rebel troops wanted to defend Fengtai Station, leading to fierce fighting for several hours, but they were eventually surrounded by Shang Zhen's troops. The rebel troops then surrendered. At noon, Peiping lifted the curfew. It is reported that a mutiny has occurred in Tongzhou, a demilitarized zone. There are also reports of disturbances in Changxindian. The Peiping rebels clearly acted according to a predetermined plan, first attacking the South Gate because there were railway tracks running through it. Railway traffic between Peiping and Tianjin is temporarily completely suspended. Opinions differ on who is in charge of this rebellion. Some say that the rebels are led by a certain officer formerly under Wu Peifu, but the commander of the South Gate garrison said that the rebels there were commanded by Shi Yousan. The capital is currently like a dead city, with all traffic suspended and a curfew in effect. Banks, shops, and schools are all closed. The Japanese military authorities have stated that this is purely an internal Chinese affair and that there is no reason to interfere at present, but if the disturbances spread, the Japanese will have to take steps to protect Japanese residents. Planes from the Kwantung Army frequently circled over Peiping during the day, and approximately 300 guards from the Japanese legation gathered in the legation barracks to prevent incidents. (Reuter's dispatch, 11/18)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu, the supervisor of the Fengtai Station factory, reported to the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau that at 11:20 PM on the night of the 27th, the Peiping-Shenyang train No. 20 arrived at Fengtai. Many bandits got off the train and occupied the station, cutting off traffic. Personnel were assigned to guard the telephone exchange. Some of the soldiers of the 6th Squadron of armored vehicles stationed at the station joined forces with the bandits. The bandits demanded armored vehicle locomotives from the factory, but because the boilers were being cleaned, they could not be fired up. The bandits then forced the opening of the factory's No. 324 locomotive to tow armored vehicles to Peiping. Gunfire and cannon fire were then heard in the distance. At 9:00 AM, they retreated without stopping, and then drove to Huangshipo. They stopped outside the station to the north. The bandits changed into plain clothes and kidnapped the Huang Shipo stationmaster. At 11:40 AM, the commander of the armored vehicle unit, Cao Yaozhang, chased after them on the 5th squadron's armored vehicle. By noon, order had been restored in Fengtai. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) This morning, a certain division in our city was urgently ordered to cooperate with the defending soldiers at the South Breach to jointly surround and attack the bandits, so the bandits did not succeed. When the division was mobilized, the troops stationed in Nanyuan also received orders to advance north, intercepting the bandits' rear. The standoff lasted until dawn. Because the bandits were attacked from both sides, and because the Nanyuan army had completely dug up the railway tracks between Yongdingmen and Fengtai, the bandits once retreated to the station outside Yongdingmen. Later, because our army surrounded and attacked them, by 9:00 AM this morning, the bandits abandoned the armored vehicles and fled on foot towards Fengtai. At this time, the commander of the armored vehicle corps also led armored vehicles to assist. Because our army advanced quickly, the bandits abandoned the armored vehicles of the 6th Squadron, which were recovered by our army without damage. When the bandits retreated in disarray towards Fengtai, they carried more than sixty bodies that had been killed in the vehicles. The rest fled eastward from Fengtai, currently fleeing towards the border area of Tongxian and Sanhe. Officers and soldiers are currently dividing up to search. At 9:30 AM, our army completely recovered Fengtai, and is currently out searching for and suppressing them. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Long-distance telephone service between Peiping and Tianjin was temporarily interrupted on the morning of the 28th. From Tianjin, it was only possible to speak to Fengtai, and even then the connection was intermittent. The Peiping-Tianjin telegraph line was not damaged, and the volume of telegrams was extremely heavy. (Special dispatch, 11/18)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to sources in the communications authorities, the Fengtai incident occurred at 8:00 PM on the night of the 27th, when more than 200 plainclothes bandits boarded the Peiping-Shenyang slow train No. 24 from Tianjin, mixed in with ordinary passengers. At 11:20 PM, when the train arrived at Fengtai, the bandits got off the train, removed their plain clothes, revealing white shirts and blue pants, and with the symbol of the Righteous Autonomous Army wrapped around their arms. They seized the vehicles of the 5th and 6th squadrons of armored vehicles stationed at the station. The commander of the 6th Squadron was a former subordinate of Shi Yousan and coerced his subordinates to be accomplices, and the bandit troops occupied it. At 1:00 AM, they drove the vehicles towards Peiping to attack Yongdingmen. Until noon on the 28th, they were attacked from the front and rear by the Miao Zhengliu and Song Kentang divisions. The bandit troops were unsuccessful and drove back to Fengtai. Without stopping, they retreated to Huangshipo, unloaded heavy machine guns and other weapons from the vehicles, and fled towards Tongxian and Yanjiao. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said that the Fengtai incident involved two armored trains stationed there. One part of armored vehicle went to Peiping for disturbance, and another part conducted disturbances in Fengtai. There were more than 200 bandits in total. Afterwards, they were surrounded and suppressed by the Miao's brigade, the Lu and Liu regiments, and the cavalry battalion of the 32nd Army. It was resolved at noon, and the bandits abandoned their vehicles and fled far away towards Tongzhou. Post-incident matters will be handled by the Military Council. There is no cause for concern about the security of Tianjin, and the military and police have been working together to strictly prevent incidents. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong, the director of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau, who is currently convalescing at Beidaihe due to illness, telegraphed the railway bureau to inquire about the truth of the Fengtai incident after hearing about it on the 28th. (Special dispatch, 28th) Empty rooms in the East Legation Quarter are now fully rented and occupied.</p>
<p>(Peiping) Peiping's security has now been fully restored, which is due to the local authorities' swift response. The overall situation was settled in the afternoon, the curfew order was lifted, and most of the city gates have been reopened. The reasons for the disturbances are rumored to be varied. When the armored vehicles drove to the west city, they fired fragmentation shells into the city. Fortunately, the residents were mostly asleep, and there were few deaths or injuries. This afternoon, a Japanese spokesman stated that the Japanese authorities were quite satisfied that the Chinese authorities had quelled the disturbances and would therefore not take any action. The official quarters are now denying the claim that the rebels were subordinates of Wan Fulin. According to reliable sources, when the army recovered the armored vehicles at 11:00 AM this morning, they observed that there were many weapons in the vehicles that had never been seen before, including 55 five-centimeter Mitta light cannons and three machine guns. This afternoon, one plainclothes soldier was arrested outside the Peiping Municipal Government, carrying three handguns. After interrogation, he admitted that there were a total of 300 plainclothes soldiers hiding in various parts of the city. Therefore, the authorities have decided to reissue the curfew order, prohibiting pedestrians from 8:00 PM tonight. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) More than 30 plainclothes soldiers have sneaked into the war zone. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The approximately 2,000 bandits commanded by Bai Jianwu, a former subordinate of Wu Peifu, have retreated eastward after being attacked by Wan Fulin's troops. Also, the armored vehicles that attempted to invade the city through Yongdingmen late on the 27th fled northwest after being attacked by Shang Zhen's troops and the security forces at 9:30 AM on the 28th. (Electric News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Haijiao's gang, the former Old Mouse's troops from Qingshankou outside the Great Wall, engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese puppet joint forces on the 26th. Zhang's bandit gang claimed to be the "Manchu-Mongolian Autonomous National Salvation Army" and posted slogans everywhere saying that they would not disturb the people. Cao Yao, the commander of the armored vehicle corps, arrived at Fengtai from the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway on the 28th by armored vehicles to search for the bandits. Passenger trains between Peiping and Tianjin accelerated through the Huangshupo-Fengtai area as a precaution. Mail between Peiping and Tianjin was interrupted for a day and was restored on the evening of the 28th. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Efforts Following the Reduction of Export Taxes <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— End</p>
<p>The Customs Export Tariff. In order to reduce or eliminate export taxes, a major revision has been made and was announced on the 25th of this month. As a result of this revision, animal products have largely benefited from tax reductions. Marine fish and shellfish, fresh and dried fruits, are entirely tax-free. Vegetables, vegetable oils, and peanuts and raw kernels have also been reduced in tax. Furthermore, metals, which accounted for 5.74% of the total value of exports last year, are now tax-free, with the exception of yellow, purple copper and tin ingots. There are even more exemptions in the miscellaneous goods category. The vast majority of what this newspaper previously hoped the authorities would implement in terms of reduction and exemptions (see March 27, 24th year, editorial) has now been realized. It is estimated that there are 41 items with reduced taxes and 87 tax-free items. Adding to the original 38 tax-free items, there are now a total of 125 tax-free export items. It can be said that, apart from the occasional one or two uniquely produced in our country that are still taxed, the majority of export goods have benefited from reductions and exemptions.</p>
<p>At a time when the country's finances are difficult, the government has taken this measure, although it cannot be implemented immediately, but its painstaking efforts to protect industry and commerce should be seen by the people of the country. Moreover, the reason why it cannot be implemented immediately is, as Minister Kong said, "... once abolished, before a definite compensation is determined, revenue will inevitably be greatly affected. The government must pay attention to relieving industry and commerce on the one hand, and to balancing income and expenditure on the other. It should be implemented immediately after the compensation has been properly prepared." This is because there is no temporary remedy in finance. It is believed that the way to raise compensation is to either implement fair new taxes or reorganize existing tax revenues. However, the only way to compensate is still to increase import tax rates to increase import tax revenue to make up for the loss of reduced or eliminated export taxes. The trend is smooth, and it also fully protects domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce. It is also a path taken by all countries internationally, so there is no need for hesitation.</p>
<p>Some argue that strict tax barriers are common in countries around the world today. However, China's situation is unique, and there is often a feeling of hidden restrictions. For example, the changes in the tax regulations for cotton goods and marine products in the 23rd year were also to comply with the requests of friendly nations. If this situation does not change, increasing import taxes will face many obstacles. Moreover, there are still mutually beneficial agreements on some items. Even if there are increases in the future, I am afraid there will not be many. Increasing or decreasing tariffs is a country's internal affair. If country A levies heavy taxes on country B's imports, country B only has one way to retaliate with retaliatory taxes. For example, recently, because Canada increased import taxes on Japanese goods and levied other tariffs in addition to the ordinary import tax, the Japanese only responded by levying an ad valorem import tax of 50% on eight items imported from Canada, including lumber, wheat, flour, and pulp. (See the 26th-day Japan United Press dispatch). It is not heard that there are any other actions besides this. This shows that changes in commodity tax rates, except for agreed-upon tariffs, are beyond the intervention of others. Moreover, even if there are changes in China's import tariffs, it is for the sake of self-survival and is different from Canada's taxation, which contains exclusive characteristics. There is no reason to invite foreign objections.</p>
<p>However, although our country's export taxes have not been completely abolished, they have been gradually reduced and exempted. Therefore, if there is a solution for finance, I know that the government will definitely not hesitate to completely eliminate these export taxes. The only thing that the government can benefit industry and commerce is protection. Now that export taxes have been largely reduced and exempted, how will our industry and commerce promote their products overseas? This is the responsibility of industry and commerce itself. In the past, although speakers have been earnest about the failure of the export business, what have industry and commerce done to improve themselves? Now that the national crisis is destroying everything and foreign goods are dumping more fiercely, our industry and commerce are in a more difficult situation and bear greater responsibilities. If they still follow old ways and seek only small immediate gains, without considering the greater difficulties of the future, then their greatest achievement will only be a foreign goods seller begging for leftovers. Therefore, how to develop the export industry in the future depends on each industry thoroughly examining past failures and what others do better than us. On the one hand, unite various industries related to exports to fight together overseas. On the domestic front, establish close contact, and have the determination to seek survival in desperate situations, with an unwavering spirit. Other parties should also do their utmost to help the export business, with sympathetic supervision. In order to maintain the credibility of export goods, the same industry should conduct strict inspections to prevent inferior goods from being sold in abundance to protect our foreign credibility. As for those handled by the state, it is hoped that the procedures will be simple, the handling will be swift, and the fees will be low. If constant efforts are made by all parties in this way, there may be hope for a turnaround in foreign exports.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Guo Taiqi's Important Speech at the All-England Peace Conference: Urgently Stating the Necessity of Maintaining Political Morality Internationally; A Strong and Powerful China Is a Solid Tower for World Peace <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to London Guo Taiqi delivered a speech at the 25th meeting of the All-England Peace Conference here today, emphasizing the importance of political morality and international integrity for the world, especially for China. The meeting was chaired by the famous British politician Henderson, with many foreign representatives in attendance. In his speech, Ambassador Guo stated that the close contact between countries has never been as close as it is today, and the mutual rejection has never been as great as it is today. China's construction of the Great Wall was justified, at least it was used to reject ancient barbarism. However, the tariff and quota barriers of the new era, and the suspicion and interrogation of entrants, only seek to close the country to reject their own kind, and develop the appendages of barbarism. One trend that can be detected today is that the conclusion of treaties is only to conceal aspirations. Its clear words can be ingeniously cancelled without damaging credibility. Concluding treaties is a way to secure peace, and its general dignity has not been slightly reduced, it is not correct to say this. China is probably the most victimized, but the institutions of international peace have been broken. Maintaining the health of international political life does not lie in concluding more treaties, its only condition lies in respecting all our treaties. Fundamental democracy and political philosophy are the same in China and Britain. In Chinese history, its brilliance is often diminished, but it can always be restored in time. Ambassador Guo then elaborated that although the Chinese government has encountered unprecedented difficulties, it has not relaxed its efforts in national construction. He said, "We Chinese especially regard Sir Rose's visit to China as a sincere manifestation of Britain's willingness to cooperate with China in technical matters." Ambassador Guo then asked the audience to read Wang Jingwei's "The Chinese Question and Its Solution," and concluded by saying that what China needs is respect for its sovereignty, independence, and integrity. China's needs are also the needs of the whole world. A strong and powerful China is a solid tower for world peace. (Reuter dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">British Public Opinion Tested: Peace Vote Results Announced <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>More Than 10 Million People Participated in the Vote; Supporting the League of Nations and Supporting Disarmament</p>
<p>(London) The League of Nations Association held a conference at Albert Hall today. Representatives of various political parties, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, and other diplomats attended the joint platform. Viscount Cecil announced the results of the "Peace Vote" on the League of Nations, disarmament, and the international control of armaments. A total of 11.5 million people participated in the vote. More than 11 million votes supported Britain remaining a member of the League of Nations, with only 356,000 votes against. Approximately 10.5 million votes supported uniform reductions in armaments under international control, with only 862,000 votes against. Approximately 10.5 million votes also supported banning the manufacture of weapons for profit, with 775,000 votes against. As for the question of whether to implement economic and non-military sanctions against aggressor countries, 10 million votes were in favor, with 635,000 votes against. Only 6.75 million votes supported the implementation of military contributions, with 2.351 million votes against. Speakers included Canterbury Archbishop Lamb, Archbishop of the City Noehut, International Women's Suffrage and Equal Citizenship Alliance President Mrs. Ashebi, and Trade Union Congress Secretary-General Sir Citrine. When two of the speakers praised Cabinet Minister Eden's efforts to promote peace in Europe, cheers arose one after another. This can be regarded as one of the highlights of the meeting. A woman serving in the labor community delivered a speech petitioning for mothers who were victims of the war, and many listeners were moved to tears. Dr. Noehut said, "People's hearts are the same. The majority of people in all countries of the world must feel the same as us." The audience also responded with cheers. Viscount Cecil declared that there are very few bright spots in the international community. One of them is that Britain's support for the League of Nations is more serious and clear than before. He hoped that the results of this vote could show the world that it can now rely on Britain's support for the collective security system. Afterwards, the meeting passed a resolution urging the government to implement a policy of peaceful construction and universal disarmament. Only one person voted against it, and the crowd shouted "Expel him!" "Expel him!" endlessly. (Reuter dispatch, 27th)</p>

However, regarding the mission completed during this trip, I will submit a report to the Cabinet and cannot announce anything. What I can say is that the talks with the French and Italian governments were conducted in a spirit of utmost sincerity." When a reporter asked if he planned to go to France again in the near future, Eden replied, "I don't know about this. I will first report the results of this trip to my Cabinet colleagues. In short, everything must be left to fate." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

The European collective peace system is likely to be completely destroyed within a few months.

<p>(Paris) British Minister without Portfolio Eden returned to the country by plane at 7:45 PM. He had a brief meal with Premier and Foreign Minister Laval at a restaurant at noon, but did not continue the conversation. In the afternoon, Laval accompanied Eden to the Chamber of Deputies to observe the meeting. This morning, Eden and Laval discussed methods to implement the various issues proposed at the Stresa Conference, but there were still no results. It is heard that the British Cabinet decided yesterday to request the French government to put forward new proposals, but Eden has not yet received this instruction. Generally speaking, Britain has always agreed with the suggestions in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3, but insists that individual issues should be resolved through bilateral agreements whenever possible. France, on the other hand, has always insisted that the procedures proposed at the Stresa Conference should be resolved simultaneously. According to informed sources, France does not oppose the question of the Skyoggano Convention being discussed before other issues, but with one condition: that the existing links between the Sky Convention, the Eastern European Convention, the Danube River Convention, and land armaments issues must be strictly maintained. After Eden returns to the country, Anglo-French negotiations will continue through diplomatic channels. The British side hopes that the differences between the two sides can be reconciled soon. Regarding the Abyssinian issue, it is heard that Eden only briefly notified Laval of the situation of his talks with Mussolini, without putting forward any suggestions to Laval. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden arrived here from Rome and, after meeting with Premier Laval again, flew back to London today. It is generally believed that the results of Eden's trip are mixed. However, the detailed content of his talks with French Premier Laval and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has not been fully disclosed. It is impossible to rashly draw a final conclusion based on the brief press releases. At 1:30 PM today, Laval announced to the press the results of his talks with Eden, "Sir Eden returned from Rome and told me the content of his discussions with Prime Minister Mussolini. We have studied good methods to resolve the issues within the scope of the London Protocol of February 3 and are working hard to achieve it. We are now deciding to continue the review through diplomatic channels because of the short time and the inability to deliberate at length. We have the same feeling and determination to adjust the methods we use and promote the plan of February 3. As for the Abyssinian issue, Eden also told me the content of his discussions with Mussolini." Before leaving, Eden went to the French House of Deputies at the afternoon meeting and sat in the diplomatic seat to listen. Then he met with Laval again in the cabinet room.

<p>(Berlin) Laval's mention in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that the door to Franco-German negotiations is now open has attracted considerable attention from Berlin newspapers. The Berlin Daily News believes that Laval's wording is too solemn and considers it not only a probe to Germany but also a probe to Britain. The newspaper then mentioned Britain's attitude, stating that when Laval asked Britain what attitude it would take towards Anglo-French cooperation, Britain replied with reserved independent action. It can be seen that although Britain and France cooperate in the future, it is parallel in nature, not a complete policy of commonality. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(London) Newspaper commentary on Eden's trip to Paris and Rome is mostly disappointed because there are no very definite results. Although they want to cover it up, they are unable to do so. The Daily Mail's Paris dispatch stated that although Eden's talks with Laval cannot be said to have made no progress, the main issues have not been resolved. However, The Times believes that Eden's trip has at least one achievement, that Laval is no longer as opposed to France and Germany holding direct talks as before. Therefore, Germany's plan to send Ribbentrop to France to discuss disarmament issues may not be rejected again. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph, Britain has proposed to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to revise the northern border of Abyssinia, so that the coastal area of Abyssinia's Artiga province can be incorporated into Italian colonies. It is also heard that the Emperor of Abyssinia is preparing to hold a joint conference with France, Italy, and Britain to negotiate a solution to satisfy part of Italy's hopes. Abyssinia is willing to grant Italy the convenience of exploiting its mineral resources, but is unwilling to give up Abyssinia's political independence. To compensate for Abyssinia's losses, Britain is willing to cede a part of British Somaliland as a "corridor" for Abyssinia to reach the Red Sea. However, Mussolini did not agree to take Britain's proposal as the basis for negotiations. According to the Daily Telegraph, Italy's minimum demand seems to be to annex most of Abyssinia's territory and place the entire country under Italian protection. Italy's demands are very different from Britain's proposals, so the negotiations are completely deadlocked. The newspaper also said that if the League of Nations opposes Italy's plan to annex Abyssinia, Italy will inevitably withdraw from the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>The Hague: The Italian-Abyssinian Joint Arbitration Committee issued a communiqué after continuing its meeting at the Scheveningen Grand Hotel this morning, stating that the committee has taken the necessary preparations to allow representatives from both Italy and Abyssinia to present their statements to the committee. Therefore, the governments of both Italy and Abyssinia will probably send representatives here. The representative sent by Abyssinia is Professor Sis, a legal advisor at the Abyssinian embassy in France and a professor at the University of Paris. Someone asked a member of the committee, who replied that the committee's work is to specifically seek the responsibility for the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The member did not conceal that the future of the work is fraught with difficulties. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a message from the capital of Abyssinia in the Daily Telegraph, the Abyssinian government recently issued a communiqué stating that Italy is continuing to send troops to East Africa, in numbers far exceeding what is needed to defend its territory. The Abyssinian government is still not preparing for mobilization. The Italian-Abyssinian Joint Arbitration Committee is meeting in Scheveningen, the Netherlands. If Italy is justified, Abyssinia will definitely satisfy it. The Emperor of Abyssinia has previously requested the League of Nations to appoint neutral members to investigate the actual situation on the ground and submit a report. The communiqué does not deny that the slave system still exists in Abyssinia, but states that progress has been made in the work of liberating slaves, and that other reforms are underway.

<h3 id="e16">Mussolini Attaches Importance to Agriculture and Participates in Threshing Work <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) During the threshing season in the Littoria Province, Prime Minister Mussolini made a special trip to the newly built villages and farms in the province's Porgu Basutia and Sapodia this morning to participate in the work, showing his importance to agriculture. He took off his coat and engaged in threshing for three hours. Afterwards, he went to the tenant registration office to sign and receive wages. Then he delivered a speech to the farmers, saying, "At this moment, we are all good farmers, and in the future, we will be good soldiers." His excited atmosphere was overflowing, and the listeners were moved. Littoria Province was transformed from marshes by the Fascist Party government in 1932 through a huge project. The province has a total area of 1,600 hectares, with 355 kilometers of roads and 1,480 kilometers of canals. There are a total of 2,167 farms and 19,29 households. The harvest this year is estimated to be 140,000 quintals, of which wheat accounts for 100,000 quintals. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Brest: Naval Chief Pittly mentioned the newly concluded Anglo-German naval agreement today and strongly criticized Britain, saying that the problem is unfortunately one of the bears. For France, it must now consider the tonnage of the British navy. This move was not necessary in the past, but now the situation is very different. Pittly also asked whether Britain had observed its traditional caution in concluding this agreement. (Reuter dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government drafted a legal draft for "Wartime National Organization," which was approved by the Supreme National Defense Council and has now been submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for opposition. The purpose of this law is to be able to use all the resources of the country in the shortest possible time in the event of war. The intention of this law is to establish a legal basis for the relationship between the state and private individuals in wartime. If a friendly agreement cannot be reached between the state and private individuals, the state can forcibly conscript. The law also stipulates that all French men and women over the age of 18 must be forced to serve the country in wartime, but the state will pay them wages. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">The British Government Plans to Convene a Naval Conference This Autumn, Will Begin Seeking Opinions from Various Countries, and the General Election Will Be Postponed to Next Spring <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters parliamentary correspondent learned that the British general election, originally scheduled for October, now appears to be postponed until next year. In addition to the heavy legislative agenda, including a new unemployment bill, it is reported that the government will soon begin seeking opinions from various countries in the hope of convening a naval conference this autumn, with London as the venue. Therefore, the general election seems likely to be held in early next year. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, when asked whether he supports British Prime Minister Baldwin's proposal for Anglo-American naval cooperation or alliance, Naval Secretary Swanson did not directly answer, but said that this was entirely a matter for the State Department and Congress, and the Navy Department had no right to make decisions on its behalf. However, Swanson also stated that so-called cooperation would only be effective in wartime, and when war came, the United States would welcome any assistance that could help it win. (National dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations for convening a naval conference in October of this year, although the British side is working hard to proceed, it now seems to have reached a deadlock. Germany is unwilling to immediately submit a detailed plan for its naval shipbuilding program. Germany's intentions regarding its navy are quite ambiguous, especially concerning aircraft carriers. According to German newspaper reports, Germany plans to build two aircraft carriers, which has caused considerable anxiety among British officials. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement stipulates that Germany can exceed the 35% ratio for submarine construction, to the point of being equal to Britain. The intention of this provision was to have Germany divert the tonnage of aircraft carriers to the construction of submarines. Now, there is widespread fear that Germany will still build aircraft carriers, creating a new situation in the naval issue, and then demand an increase in the submarine ratio. It is rumored that if Britain allows Germany to immediately begin building submarines, Germany may not build battleships before the expiration of the Washington Treaty in 1936. In addition, the preparatory negotiations between the British government and France, Italy, and the Soviet Union regarding the naval conference have encountered significant difficulties. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the naval conference can be held at the time proposed by Britain. Britain recently invited naval experts from France, Russia, and the United States to hold preliminary naval talks in London in the near future. However, the French side replied that if France participated in these talks, public opinion would consider France to have tacitly approved the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The Italian government indicated that it would need a considerable period before it could send experts to London. The Soviet Union also took a similar reserved attitude and expressed opposition to Sweden increasing its Baltic Sea fleet, saying that since the Anglo-German Naval Agreement had been established, the only way to guarantee the safety of the Baltic Sea was for Britain to allow respect for the neutrality of the Danish Straits (the straits connecting the Baltic Sea and the North Sea) in wartime. Therefore, it can be seen that even the preliminary expert talks may be difficult to hold. It is also rumored that Britain has proposed that if the naval conference is held in October of this year, the following issues should be included on the agenda: (1) If the total naval tonnage cannot be regulated by ratios between countries, at least the maximum limits should be set for the tonnage and gun caliber of various classes of warships. (2) Each country attending the naval conference should allow each other to notify the governments of other countries of their naval shipbuilding plans within six years and agree not to change these planned shipbuilding programs within six years. However, in some democratic countries, governments often change, and political strategies are also frequently revised, making it difficult to avoid changing shipbuilding plans within six years. This is also a difficulty facing the future of the naval conference. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Germany Actively Constructing Highways <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The highway stretching 1,500 kilometers from Frankfurt to Darmstadt was just completed and opened to traffic in late last month, and the highway from Berlin to Stettin (at the mouth of the Oder River on the Baltic Sea coast) will also be completed within days. It can be seen that the government's highway construction project is now progressing rapidly. It is reported that the construction of this road is a massive project, not only erecting two 225-meter-long bridges over the Oder River, but also filling in many swamps with 2 million cubic meters of sand to ensure the stability of the roadbed.

<p>(Paris) The Institute of Pacific Relations, founded by the late General Maurice Bourquin and others, has been in existence for four years. The committee has invited famous people to give speeches on Far Eastern issues more than fifty times. Notable examples include Maurice Morel, Deputy Director of the International Labour Office, and Professor Escarra of the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris, advisor to the Chinese government, who have all given lectures. Today, the committee held a meeting and invited Haas, director of the Communications Section of the League of Nations, to give a speech. Haas spent a long time in China. His last trip was as a liaison officer between the League of Nations and the Chinese Economic Committee, on a mission to China for two months. He described in detail the various efforts of the Chinese government in construction, saying that the authorities all embraced pragmatism, and young people were also not focused on theory but inclined towards practice. China is progressing very quickly in material terms, such as: (1) Highways, which are well-built, comfortable to travel on, and have no accidents along the way. He himself traveled 1,500 kilometers on these highways. Cars and buses traveling on the highways must pay road tolls to cover road maintenance costs. Provincial officials are currently studying the construction of bridges and the use of charcoal-powered vehicles for transportation. (2) Railways. (3) Industry, especially in Shanxi and Guangdong, is the most developed. He visited leather and wool factories in Shanxi and sugar refineries in Guangdong. (4) Water conservancy. The authorities spare no effort in managing various rivers, especially the irrigation projects in the Northwest. (5) Agriculture. Haas was deeply impressed by the influence of the cooperative movement on rural life and organization in China, which attracted the attention of the audience, saying that there is a general trend towards the application of scientific methods in rural areas everywhere. As for rural health issues, government offices have established health bureaus everywhere. Once established, villagers flock to them, vying to be first, and the results have been very good. Haas concluded by saying that the various reforms he witnessed in China proved that work in various economic fields has deeply penetrated the bottom of society. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 23rd plenary session on the morning of the 28th, with 65 members including Jiao Yitang in attendance. Sun Ke presided, and Liang Hancao served as secretary-general. The following matters were discussed: (1) Civil Servant Performance Appraisal Law; (2) Civil Servant Performance Appraisal Rewards and Punishments Regulations; Resolution: Both were passed as reviewed by the Legal System Committee. (3) Amendment to Article 10 of the Supreme Court Organization Law; Resolution: Passed as reviewed by the Legal System Committee. The Chief Secretary of the Supreme Court will remain a recommended appointment, without promotion to simplified appointment. The article does not need to be amended. (4) Bankruptcy Enforcement Law Drafted by the Civil Law Committee; Resolution: Passed as presented. The law contains six articles. The most important is the provision of Article 149 of the Bankruptcy Law, which stipulates that events of inability to pay debts that were completed before the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law are not applicable. Those who were declared bankrupt before the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law may apply for restoration of rights in accordance with the law. The Provisional Regulations on Debt Settlement for Merchants will become invalid after the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law. In addition, it is planned to set October 1 as the implementation date of the law, and it will be submitted to the National Government for approval. (5) Convention on the Employment of Women for Night Work; (6) Convention on Compensation for Occupational Diseases of Workers; (7) Convention on the Regulation of Working Hours in Automatic Glass Factories; (8) Convention on Guaranteeing Compensation and Allowances for Workers Forced into Unemployment; Resolution: All four of the above cases were passed as reviewed by the Foreign Affairs and Labor Law Committees and should be temporarily suspended from ratification. As for the Vocational Introduction Law, although the Legislative Yuan had completed the second reading process, the chairman believed that the case contained many foreign legal codes and neglected the national conditions of the country, so it would be nothing more than a formality after promulgation. For the sake of caution, he advocated that it should be returned for review. The motion was unanimously passed, and Shi Weihuan, Lou Tongsun, Shi Shangkuan, Lin Bin, Luo Ding, and Wei Tingsheng were designated as reviewers for the case, to be convened by Shi Weihuan. Subsequently, a closed-door meeting was held to deliberate on the Sichuan Reconstruction Public Debt Regulations and the Ministry of Finance's plan to compensate for the shortfall in revenue and expenditure in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) general budget. It is reported that the results have been passed as presented. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, based on the debt revenue of 50 million yuan listed in the revenue of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) general budget, has decided to issue 100 million yuan in customs revenue public debt to compensate for the shortfall in revenue and expenditure in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) and to recover the 50 million yuan in treasury bonds originally issued. The relevant regulations were passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 28th and will be issued on June 30. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The formal fundraising measures formulated by the Ministry of Finance for the debt funds originally listed in the temporary revenue category of the national general budget for the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) are now known to be nothing more than issuing public debt. For a long time, the Green Ministry of Finance has planned to issue public debt based on the regulations in the national general budget for the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) to offset bank interest loans. However, it is still difficult to raise a large amount of funds. After repeated planning by the Ministry, it was only possible to draw out a portion of the short-term treasury bond funds issued in recent years to guarantee the new debt, so as not to increase the burden of tax rates, and the new debt could also be issued. As a result, the Central Government approved the issuance of public debt to exchange a portion of the 50 million yuan face value of the customs treasury bonds for the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), returning bank interest loans, which is also used to compensate for the shortfall in revenue and expenditure in the national general budget for the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). The interest rate on the new debt is 6% per annum, with interest paid quarterly every three months. The debt term is ten years, and the principal and interest will be fully repaid by June 30, 1945. The face value is issued at 98, divided into three types: 5,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 100 yuan. The Central Bank is designated to pay principal and interest. The public debt regulations were approved smoothly at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th. The name and amount of the debt will not be announced by the Ministry of Finance before issuance.

All prisons should uniformly use machines to ensure simplicity, kindness, and speed, and should use anesthesia methods as far as possible at the time of execution to reduce the suffering. However, before machines are purchased, manual hanging methods will still be used. In addition to submitting a report to the Judicial Yuan for record, the ministry should instruct all prisons to comply. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Local News) Ambassador Arita issued a statement at 11:00 a.m. today (the 28th) regarding the North China and Chahar issues. The contents are recorded below: (1) The continued occurrence of the North China and Chahar incidents prompted the Japanese Imperial military authorities to make fair demands on the Chinese military authorities based on the Armistice Agreement. It is fortunate that the Chinese military authorities have accepted these demands, leading to an improvement in the situation. We also hope, as expected in the statement of the commander of the Japanese army stationed in China, that the Chinese side will increase its efforts to maintain peace in that area. This is our earnest hope.</p>
<p>(2) In order to achieve a complete reconciliation of the relations between Japan and China, we believe that it is necessary to eliminate the anti-Japanese sentiment throughout China, not just in one place. However, to this day, that sentiment has not been completely eradicated. At this juncture, we should promote the full implementation of the order for good neighborly relations promulgated by China and hope to make further efforts to ban anti-Japanese sentiment. This is our earnest expectation. (Japan United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The commander of the Japanese army stationed in China issued a statement at 11:00 a.m. today regarding the North China and Chahar incidents, saying that the Chinese side has already promised to implement the Japanese army's fair and just demands regarding the issue of illegal activities by some Chinese officials and civilians in North China and Chahar Province. This is fortunate, and we acknowledge their sincerity and plan to temporarily observe the state of their implementation and await the improvement of the situation. The demands made by the Japanese army in this negotiation are based on the regulations of the Armistice Agreement, the oath of the Sino-Japanese military and police to punish those responsible for violating the agreement, to eliminate the source of trouble, to rebuild trust, to maintain peace, and to remove the threat to "Manchukuo" and the obstacles to Sino-Japanese friendship. Any deliberate expansion of the situation or interference in China's internal affairs is definitely not something we have ever considered. Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation are what Japanese civil and military officials earnestly desire, but this cannot be achieved through superficial formalities or rhetoric. Considering the deep-rooted origins of the unfortunate incidents that have occurred this time, we deeply regret it. However, the Chinese government recently reissued a proclamation prohibiting anti-Japanese and anti-foreign activities throughout the country and has taken a step forward in eliminating the aforementioned source of trouble, which is admirable. The Japanese army hopes that the Chinese authorities will eliminate all anti-Japanese and anti-Manchukuo activities in various aspects of the region. This is our statement. (Japan United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army issued a statement in the form of a discussion on the main points of the important statement issued today by Commander Umezu of the Japanese garrison army in China. The gist of the statement is as follows: The statement by the commander of the Japanese garrison army in China is not only the opinion of the army stationed there but also fully coordinated with the central army headquarters, indicating the general intention of the army. The disposal of North China in the future is all contained in this statement. We hope that the harmonious relationship between China and Japan will be realized in a substantial and concrete way. In order to hope that the friendly relationship will be permanent, the resolution of the North China situation is particularly desired. (Dentsu dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Accompanied by three adjutants, Chen Yi arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 28th. Representatives of Director Wang, including Chen Rui, Huang Musong, Cao Haosen, Lin Wei, and dozens of former subordinates from the military department, were all present at the station to welcome him. After alighting from the train, Chen Yi entered the city by car and rested at the Lizhi Society. It was arranged for him to meet with Director Wang and Minister He at noon on the 28th. Chen Yi spoke to reporters in detail about the administration of Fujian Province, briefly stating that he had been in Fujian for one year and five months and that the provincial situation urgently needed to be reported to the central government in detail. Therefore, he made a special trip to the capital. After the remnants of bandits in Fujian fled westward from Jiangxi, the large groups were gradually eliminated, and the local area was declared stable early on. Sporadic appearances of three to five scattered bandits are not a cause for concern. Regarding the administrative situation in recent years, last year was dedicated to stabilizing local affairs, and this year, we began organizing the work, actively rectifying local administration. For example, in the past, the collection of land taxes in various counties had no "fish scale" records to verify, and no one knew how much was collected. After the reorganization, taxes are now collected according to the register, so that every penny goes to the public, and the people are spared the suffering of excessive levies. Also, in the past, when county magistrates were replaced, county government personnel would leave with them. Now, county government officials do not change with the removal or replacement of the county magistrate. In addition to the reorganization, we are also supplementing with investigation and research this year, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and construction work can begin next year. The financial situation was originally extremely chaotic in the past. Although reorganization began last year, it was greatly affected by the brief incursion of Jiangxi bandits into Fujian, resulting in a budget deficit of one million yuan in the 23rd year. Measures are now being taken to make up for this in the 24th year budget. I will stay in the capital for about a week before returning to Fujian. It is not yet decided whether to go to Sichuan.

<h3 id="e77">West River Flood in Guangdong Province Five Counties' Dikes Collapse One After Another Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway Partially Submerged <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Since the beginning of summer in Guangdong Province, continuous rain has caused the water levels of various rivers to rise sharply. After the major flood in the East River, the West River has recently suffered from flooding. It is found that the water source of the West River comes from Guizhou and Guangxi provinces. The flood in the Yongjiang River in Nanning, Guangxi, and the Pingle area last month was followed by a rise of more than ten feet in the water in Wuzhou on the 20th of this month. Moreover, the water flow is turbulent, and there are frequent reports of boats capsizing on the river surface. After the 20th, the rapids reached Guangdong. The embankments in the upper reaches of the West River in various counties collapsed one after another due to the failure to rescue them in time. As a result, the villagers suffered a second flood disaster. At this time, the rural areas went bankrupt, and another flood can be described as one disaster after another. It is reported that the water level of the West River rose to 39 feet on the 23rd. If it rises another two feet, it will break the highest flood record. The first to suffer were the villages along the river in Ducheng. On the morning of the 23rd, the Yanzhou dike in Gaoyao County, located at the Xiaokou of Zhaoqing, was suddenly broken by the West River flood. The loss inside the dike was hundreds of thousands, and all agricultural products were washed away. Since the West River flood broke horizontally from the Xiaokou, the two counties of Guangning and Sihui in the northern corner of the West River were not spared. In Qitian Township, the fifth district of Guangning County, the river water suddenly rose by two or three zhang. The waves were turbulent, and the most solid dikes in the township were already in danger on the 19th. The villagers rescued day and night, but finally the water power was too strong and could not be resisted. A breach of more than ten zhang occurred, and the vegetables, grains, and rice seeds sown in the dike were all submerged. The Baihe Dike, Huanggang Dike, and Lufu Dike in Sihui County collapsed one after another on the 11th day of the month (lunar calendar). The rice in each dike was just maturing and about to be harvested, but was suddenly submerged, and not a single grain remained. The fields and houses were completely submerged. The villagers supported the old and carried the young to flee to the mountains, sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind, waiting for food, and the situation was miserable and in urgent need of relief. As for the water level of the West River, it had risen to 39 feet on the 23rd. If it rises another two feet, it will break the highest flood record. The first to suffer was the villages along the river in Ducheng. The Chongbu Dike in the fifth district of Gaoming County spans ten townships and has a low terrain. When the dikes in Guangning and Sihui collapsed, the flood spread violently. Finally, at dawn on the 22nd, a section of Baisha was broken by the water, with a dike base of dozens of zhang. In an instant, the Baisha Township, Shizui Township, Chencun, Qinshui Township, Shuibuzhou, Luotang Township, Pingshan Township, Haiyong Village, Gongcun, Yagang and other townships, which depended on the dike for protection, became a country. 60,000 to 70,000 villagers who fled to the mountains went without food and slept in the open air. The situation was dire. On the evening of the 20th, the West River flood submerged Hekou, Sanshui County. In Hekou Xu and Southwest Town, the water depth on the ground was submerged, and boats were used for transportation. The Rongshu Dike, the County Front Dike, and the Da Dun Dike in the county collapsed one after another. More than 100,000 villagers guarded and patrolled day and night, and telegraphed the province to purchase 50,000 sacks to be transported to the county within a limited time for storing sand to block the gap. On the 23rd, the Ganzhu Dike in the county was rushed by the torrent, and dozens of townships inside the dike were flooded. The Guangzhou-Sanshui railway tracks on the Sanshui section were also flooded. From 2:00 PM on the 23rd, the Guangzhou-Sanshui train only ran from the province to Zoumaying Station. From Zoumaying to Southwest and Hekou stations, it was impossible to pass through the giant immersion. Liao, the magistrate of Sanshui County, believing that the disaster in the county was serious, came to the province yesterday to appeal for relief. (June 24)</p>

<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau is building a large-scale radio station in western Shanghai. The location has been surveyed in Xinzhuang, Songjiang County, near Qianliang Temple, Changqiao Town. It was originally planned to circle 200 mu of private land, but now it has been changed to circle 300 mu. The Ministry of Interior has issued an announcement, and the Songjiang County Government and the Township Police have notified the landowners to collect the land at a given price. The landowners in the area were greatly alarmed when they heard the news, and they repeatedly gathered to discuss and all expressed their opposition. They sent 30 representatives, including Shen Shishi, to petition the Songjiang County Government. At that time, the County Government was holding an administrative meeting, and Wu Zhongyu, the secretary of the County Government, received several representatives, including Shen Shihuan. The representative gave reasons for opposing, believing that the 300 mu of private land currently circled by the International Telecommunications Bureau has more than 200 farmers who, once purchased, would have no way to change their occupations, and it would be difficult to find rented land, and that it has been passed down for generations, and the price of the land obtained will inevitably be used up. Secretary Wu promised to forward the request to the Provincial Government to purchase another site.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Suzhou The East Taihu Lake Reclamation Case is Approaching <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The lake fields in East Taihu Lake have been enclosed on a large scale by foreign merchants. According to the survey, more than 17,000 mu of lake fields have been enclosed in the past year. A few days ago, Wu Qiyun, the magistrate of Wu County, personally led the security team and supervised more than 1,000 farmers from Hengjing and other townships to implement forced demolition of the enclosed embankments and disperse the foreign merchants. According to recent news, the enclosed embankments are more than one zhang high and more than nine chi wide. Handcarts can pass on the embankments, and they are extremely strong. There are also culverts built under the embankments to connect the water source inside the embankments to facilitate irrigation of farmland, so there is no fear of desolation, whether in drought or flood. The greatness and thoroughness of the plan can be seen from this. A few days ago, the order to demolish the enclosure only demolished dozens of defects of more than one zhang wide on the embankments. The embankments were not actually demolished. After the security team left, they were immediately repaired and restored to their original state. The enclosed fields have all been transplanted and sown, and it is expected that the harvest this autumn will be considerable. Moreover, the fields have not been raised in grain, so there is no need to bear the obligation of paying taxes. Now, Wu Yin Sheng and other villagers from Bin Hu Township in Wujiang have pointed out that this enclosure business is a collusion between local tyrants in Wujiang and foreign merchants, deceiving the government. They have jointly presented a petition to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Central Party Headquarters, and other senior agencies on the 28th, requesting a thorough demolition of the enclosure, the removal of the planted plants, and severe punishment of the leaders of the enclosure in accordance with the law in order to maintain water conservancy and prioritize the people's livelihood. The original text is lengthy and will be omitted. Wang Guochao, the foreign merchant who was detained by the county government for obstructing the demolition of the enclosure, has now been released.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Xiehe Tobacco Company Closes Due to Losses <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Xiehe Tobacco Company was founded by Tang Jingseng, a local resident, in the 20th year of the Republic, mainly engaged in the sales of Huacheng products from Shanghai. Due to losses in the past year, it was reorganized once and jointly operated by Yilongsheng. It is known that Yilongsheng recently found that expenses were high and income was low, and it was unable to maintain operations. Now, Mr. Tang has transferred it to six other fellow traders, including Dafa Xiang, to jointly operate, save expenses internally, and maintain the production of national goods. The reason for Xiehe's losses is that the sale of Huacheng cigarettes requires cash transactions. When they are sold to Changzhou, they are distributed to the various tobacco shops at the original price. The only profit is the wooden box and lead skin. Moreover, the monthly sales volume is only a few dozen middle boxes, and the income is only dozens of yuan. In addition to the use of labor, wages, food, and silver interest, etc., it costs at least more than one hundred yuan. The income cannot cover the expenses, and it is bound to lose money and close down. It is heard that Mr. Tang has lost five or six thousand gold coins since he started the business.</p>

<p>Jiang Zhen, a resident of the fourth household in the eighth jia of the second bao in the first district Cheng Erzhen, knew Liu Zhaozhen, the owner of the chicken and duck shop opposite the Midu Bridge. On the 16th of this month, Zhaozhen occasionally discussed with Jiang Zhen, saying that business was sluggish and the daily income was less than one yuan. The total capital was less than five yuan, and the tax bureau repeatedly urged the payment of taxes without any accommodation. It was impossible to make a living, and several members of the family were about to starve to death. He asked Jiang to draft a petition to the county party headquarters for relief. Jiang Zhen agreed to his request and drafted a document, which was submitted to the Party Headquarters. The tax bureau took offense at the person who drafted the petition and detained Jiang Zhen, believing that he had fabricated facts and spread rumors. He was then sent to the County Government for detention. Jiang Zhen was particularly unwilling to accept this, since there was no evidence for the rumor-spreading allegation and it was within the scope of judicial authority. The tax bureau only had the right to file a lawsuit and no right to arrest. Moreover, since Liu Zhaozhen had submitted the case to the Party Headquarters, who was right and who was wrong was a matter of public opinion. Yesterday, he specially petitioned the County Government for permission to be released on bail and await public judgment. Today, he drafted a complaint to the county prosecutor's office, accusing Zhang Mingjing, the director of the business tax bureau, of false accusation and obstruction of freedom. According to the complaint, the prosecutor's office will schedule a hearing.</p>

<p>The Hangzhou Silk Industry Market previously obtained approval from the Hangzhou Municipal Government to formulate methods for public offices to apply for registration to collect goods on behalf of customers. After the implementation, the silk and cloth merchants in Nanjing, Wuxi, and Wujin held that the methods actually exploited machine households, made it difficult for merchants, and especially harmed the Jiangsu Yu Ning two public offices established by the industry in Hangzhou. They jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and the Hangzhou Municipal Government, requesting a prompt investigation and stop to the methods. Later, the Ministry of Industry issued a document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for verification and handling, and the Hangzhou Municipal Government also telegraphed the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce in reply, stating that since merchants from various places had stated that the registration method was difficult to implement, it should be discussed at length, and relevant parties should be invited to discuss revisions. However, the silk industry in various places was still waiting for a meeting to be convened, and the Municipal Government had already revised the methods, but there was no change from the original methods regarding the exploitation of machine households and the difficulty for merchants. Yesterday, the Wuxi Silk and Cloth Industry Association reported to the Ministry of Industry through the Chamber of Commerce that it was deceiving officials, monopolizing profits, exploiting machine households, and causing endless harm. It requested that the methods be decisively dealt with and that an order be issued to abolish the methods in order to stabilize the market.</p>

<p>Since the three guilds of marine engineers, drivers, and radio operators issued an opposition to the wage cuts starting on July 1, the Municipal Shipping Industry Association, convened a meeting of members to discuss the matter, and has revised the proposal, deciding not to cut the wages of stokers and sailors with salaries above fifteen yuan, and to pay them as before, but the monthly salaries of captains, first, second, and third mates, pilots, chief engineers, first, second, and third assistant engineers, radio operators, etc., ranging from fifty yuan to four hundred yuan, will all be paid at 80% of their original amount, and supplementary payments will be discussed again when the central government has a solution for the relief of the shipping industry, This proposal will be notified to the marine engineering, driving, and radio operator sections of the crew, and will be implemented on schedule,</p>
<p>Further Opposition</p>

<h3 id="e91">Chairman Yu Zuoting of the Chamber of Commerce Publishes Opinions on Establishing the Foundation of the Financial Market, Advocating the Implementation of the Public Treasury Issuance System <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, was recently invited by the "Bank Weekly" to publish his views on establishing the foundation of the financial market, advocating the implementation of the public treasury issuance system. The "New Voice" reporter recorded his original text as follows: "The changes in the national financial market should be skillfully used to regulate currency. Credit, hard and soft currencies are all regarded as the amount of currency circulating nationwide. However, upon careful observation of the phenomenon of credit adjustment in the market, aside from the central bank's policies, in our country's situation, it often runs counter to the actual situation of the market, making it difficult to achieve a neutral and balanced effect. Hard currency is only the basis of credit, with little circulation. We, therefore, cannot but turn our attention to soft currency. All sound financial systems are often criticized by various parties due to temporary interests when they are first created. Therefore, even with the advocacy of society, their implementation is extremely slow. However, the final result is related to the soundness of the national economy and finance, ensuring its own integration into the right track of development. Therefore, when it is implemented, people begin to realize its benefits, fearing only that its implementation is not fast enough. The public treasury issuance system is a centralized issuance system where all bank notes in the country are jointly prepared by the public treasury before the country has a unified issuance right. This centralized issuance system, on the one hand, achieves the effect of unified issuance, and on the other hand, eliminates the drawbacks of free issuance. Why? Because when paper money is freely issued by various banks, they use various methods to compete and expand during market relaxation in order to seek profit. This excessive supply of funds not only fails to take into account the needs of the market, but also the excessive expansion of the market can easily lead to dangerous situations without good management. Conversely, when the market is in an emergency, various banks are eager to consolidate their positions and dare not issue more, resulting in a lack of circulation. This is in stark contrast to the function of paper money to expand and contract the market and adjust surpluses and deficits, and it is clearly an obstacle to the development of industrial and commercial economy. However, the unification of national issuance rights, based on the current financial situation of the government, the degree of national credit, and the special environment of the commercial society, is in fact difficult to implement urgently. The important function of centralized issuance becomes even more apparent. The establishment of the public treasury should be organized by various issuing banks by centralizing their issuance reserves. Then this public treasury is the common institution for the issuance of paper money by various banks, and its reserves should also be monitored by a committee organized by government financial institutions, social commercial organizations, and representatives of various issuing banks, and checked periodically to see if it meets the statutory ratio. The government collects issuance taxes from various banks based on the report of the public treasury. In this way, since the issuance of paper money is jointly prepared, the strength is concentrated and the credit is easily consolidated. Furthermore, according to the needs of the economic market, the increase or decrease of the issuance amount is controlled. When necessary, the ability to respond to the market can be expanded or contracted freely. A separate, large number of issuances does not have this advantage. Some may fear that the issuance of the public treasury will affect the psychology of the people. This is an overthinking. The credit and paper money of various banks are still the same. The ratio of issuance reserves is still the same. Now, it is only concentrated in one institution for joint issuance and preparation. Is there really an impact? Therefore, I believe that the key to the public treasury issuance system does not lie in the reaction of the people, but in the central bank's willingness to participate with an open mind, jointly promoting it. Various issuing banks should sacrifice individual rights, cooperate fully, respond to international monetary policies to adapt to the world economic trends, and pioneer the reform of the issuance system, and gradually establish a solid financial market foundation for the entire Chinese economy, which is a great cause for all generations. I hope our leaders will pay attention to it, etc."</p>

Thirty percent of the aforementioned fine shall be awarded to the informant, and the remainder shall be allocated to local anti-smoking expenses. Article 5: In order to promote registration, each province, city, and county may issue a "Limited-Time Smoking Cessation Permit for the Poor" in addition to the ordinary limited-time smoking cessation permit. Each permit costs six jiao and is valid for six months. It shall be collected and issued periodically. A. The aforementioned "Limited-Time Smoking Cessation Permit for the Poor" shall be manufactured and issued by the Provincial Anti-Smoking Supervision Office. After deducting two jiao per permit for production costs, the remaining funds shall be allocated to local anti-smoking and smoking cessation expenses. B. Those who are not genuine poor people shall not falsely claim this poor people's permit. Violators shall not only be required to obtain an ordinary limited-time smoking cessation permit but shall also be fined three to five times the fee of five yuan stipulated in Article 9 of the "Regulations for the Suppression of Smokers". C. Poor people applying for a permit must have a certificate from the local baozhang or jiazhang proving that they are indeed poor before a permit can be issued. If there is any false reporting or concealment, the certifier shall be fined half the amount fined to the permit applicant. D. If a permit holder moves or travels outside the jurisdiction of the city or county, they may hold the original permit and apply to the competent authority of the city or county they arrive at to have it stamped for continued use without having to exchange for a travel permit to show consideration. However, if the original six-month period has expired, they must pay the fee again to exchange for a new permit and must submit the old permit to the permit-issuing authority to be sent back to the original permit-issuing authority for cancellation. Article 6: Smoking institutions in each province, city, and county shall eliminate obstacles to the registration procedures for smokers, strive for simplicity, and shall not make things difficult for no reason. Article 7: All limited-time smoking cessation permits are only for the personal use of the holder and shall not be shared by a family, or lent, or used to shelter smokers. Violators shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no more than one year and shall be fined twice the amount stipulated in Article 4. Article 8: Limited-time smoking cessation permits are absolutely not allowed to be used to set up venues for people to smoke. Violators shall have their property confiscated and shall be severely punished in accordance with military law. Article 9: Smokers who voluntarily apply for smoking cessation during the registration period, whether or not they have obtained a permit, may be sent to a smoking cessation institution for treatment, and the poor shall be treated free of charge. Article 10: The provincial and municipal governments shall send personnel to patrol each county bureau's handling of smoker registration matters by region or station them there to supervise the handling. Article 11: The director of the Department of Civil Affairs or the administrative inspector shall personally go to each county at an appropriate time to guide and supervise in order to achieve rapid results. Article 12: The provincial and municipal governments shall forward the number of registered smokers under their jurisdiction to the Military Commission Chairman's Headquarters for verification on a monthly basis. After the deadline for completion, a list shall also be submitted for closing. Article 13: If the provincial and municipal governments, or the Department of Civil Affairs, and the administrative inspector find that the county magistrate and the director of the Public Security Bureau or the person in charge of anti-smoking have disobeyed orders in public and obeyed them in private, or have been perfunctory and negligent, resulting in the failure of registration to become widespread, they shall immediately be dismissed and punished and reported. Those who extort under false pretenses or accept bribes for personal gain shall be sent to the headquarters or designated military law organs for strict punishment in accordance with military law. Article 14: Officials at all levels in each province and city must supervise at each level and promptly and earnestly report any violations of the law, dereliction of duty, and personnel who are not effective in handling registration. If there is any concealment or protection, once the investigators find out the truth, or the people report it truthfully, in addition to punishing the parties concerned in accordance with the law, officials at all levels shall also be subject to appropriate punishment. Article 15: The registration of smokers in each county must, in any case, break through personal relationships and be earnestly and universally completed without omission. If there is any excuse that there are few smokers and a request to be exempted from holding the registration, the county magistrate shall be ordered to issue a certificate stating that the smokers have been eliminated. If the report is found to be untrue, they are willing to be executed, which shall be forwarded to the headquarters for verification. Article 16: If the circumstances in each province are different, implementing rules may be formulated for supplementation, but they must be based on the principle of promoting work efficiency and popularizing smoker registration. Article 17: Matters not covered in these measures shall still be handled in accordance with the "Regulations for Strict Smoking Cessation and Suppression of Smokers" and other anti-smoking laws and regulations. Article 18: These measures are valid within the registration period for smokers and shall be abolished upon expiration.</p>

<p>Talks About the Economic Decline on Both Sides of the River, Plans to Submit a Detailed Plan to the Ministry</p>
<p>Li Yunliang, Chief Auditor of the Supervisory Committee of the National China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, took the Minsheng Company's Yongnian ship west from Shanghai in order to thoroughly understand the Yangtze River shipping industry and the business of each branch. He made slight delays along the way. In addition to conducting detailed investigations into the distribution of passenger and freight transport on the Yangtze River itself, the management of storage and stacking, and the administration of wharves, he also conducted careful research on the commercial, economic, production, transportation, consumption, and other aspects of the two sides of the river related to the shipping industry, in order to provide reference for future improvements in the company's business. Therefore, Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the company, specially sent Wang, a member of the Business Section, to accompany him and assist in everything. After more than a month, he has returned to Shanghai after completing his duties the day before yesterday. It is said that during his trip west along the Yangtze River to Xufu, Sichuan, he has drafted a detailed plan for the reorganization of the business of each branch and the development of the Yangtze River shipping industry, which he will submit to the Ministry of Communications for review and which is temporarily inconvenient to publish. However, according to widespread observations, the commerce of all ports on both sides of the river has declined, especially the low prices and the suffering of the people, which are indescribable and have a significant impact on all industries. However, the amount of goods on the Yangtze River itself has not decreased. The total value of exports from Hankou last year was 6 million yuan, which is double that of the previous year.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Reduction and Exemption of Export Taxes Will Not Be Implemented on July 1st <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Implementation Will Begin After Methods of Compensation are Devised</p>
<p>The reduction and exemption of export tax rates to encourage the export of domestic goods was drafted by the Ministry of Finance, submitted to the National Government for approval, and promulgated for implementation. The Ministry of Finance originally scheduled it to be implemented on July 1st, but yesterday, according to a certain official from the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, the implementation of the reduction and exemption of export tariffs on July 1st has not yet been implemented because the Ministry is planning compensation methods that have not yet been properly negotiated. Because the country's financial situation is currently in difficulty, once a large amount of tax revenue is cut, the Ministry will inevitably be affected before the compensation is determined. The government's attention to rescuing industry and commerce is indeed an important plan at present, but the balance of the national treasury's revenue and expenditure must also be considered. Therefore, it will be implemented after the compensation is in place. As for the methods of rescuing the yarn industry and changing the unified tax, they have been proposed for discussion at the National Tax Conference held a few days ago and are currently under review. It should be decided after overall planning. In addition, regarding the date of the income tax, the tax regulations and tax rates still need to go through various procedures, so there is no fixed date. Generally, it will be implemented at the latest in the early part of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e102">China Agricultural Loan Group: Production Loans Proceed as Usual <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Current Loans Primarily for Cotton</p>
<p>Since the China Agricultural Loan Group began offering agricultural production loans, the funds disbursed have been equally shared by the ten major banks participating in the group. Given the current economic downturn, the group is focused on supporting rural production and facilitating cooperatives, with the aim of developing cotton production in provinces like Shaanxi and Hebei. There were rumors that the group intended to conclude its production loan program as the cotton market season approached. However, according to inquiries made by reporters, the group believes that agricultural loans are crucial for rural relief and will therefore continue to operate without any plans for closure. Currently, loans are primarily directed towards the cotton industry. In the future, the group will consider the needs and implement loans for other sectors as well. The implementation of sales and transport loans will be considered once the cotton harvesting season begins.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Carelessness at Da Zhonghua Celluloid Factory Results in Burns to Forty or Fifty People: Rosin Fuels Fire, Affecting Entire Warehouse with an Ear-splitting Explosion that Shook the Surroundings; Nearby Roads Filled with the Injured, Dispersed to Several Hospitals for Accommodation <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>—Several Others May Be Buried in the Fire, Excavation Underway—</p>
<p>The Da Zhonghua Celluloid Manufacturing Factory is one of the largest manufacturers of domestic toy products, with a large scale. Its manufacturing plant is located at No. 100, Lane 1371, Xiaoshadu Road, a self-built factory building. The general management office and business department are located at No. 3, Lane 44, Jiangxi Road, in the Public Concession. There are more than one hundred workers in the manufacturing plant. Therefore, in addition to the machine room and warehouse, there is a separate building for worker dormitories connected to the machine room. It is understood that most of the raw materials for celluloid toys are derived from rosin. The factory once stored a considerable amount of raw materials in the warehouse. For comprehensive prevention measures, even electrical appliances were not installed in the warehouse. Unexpectedly, the disaster originated outside of precautions. At around 7:50 PM last night, the factory workers had just finished work and were washing in their dormitories or cooling off in the corridors when a sudden fire broke out in the warehouse storing rosin and other raw materials. Rosin is highly flammable, so the fire quickly spread throughout the warehouse. With a deafening explosion, the surroundings were shaken. The walls of the warehouse were blown down by the force of the explosion, and the fire spread to the worker dormitories. Sulfur splashed everywhere, and the place was instantly ablaze. The workers, caught off guard, were unable to escape in time and were burned. In total, there were about forty or fifty injured. The stronger ones jumped from the upper floors to escape, resulting in many with foot injuries. The sounds of screams were unbearable to hear. Fortunately, the fire brigade and police had received reports and quickly dispatched fire trucks and ambulances to provide assistance. They worked hard to extinguish the fire and rescue the injured. However, there were too many injured, and it was impossible to send them all to the hospital at once. Therefore, the roads near Lane Xiaoshadu Road were filled with the injured. At the same time, it was difficult for one hospital to accommodate them, so they were sent to Tongren, Renji, Baolong, and other hospitals for treatment. Most of the injuries were to the hands, feet, head, and other parts of the body, and the injuries were severe. The fire at the factory was completely extinguished at around 10:00 PM. The warehouse and workshop were completely destroyed by the fire, resulting in significant losses. It was also reported that several workers were missing and feared to be buried in the fire. Therefore, firefighters were still excavating through the night. Seventeen people were sent to Renji Hospital, including Zhang Shouchang, 56 years old, from Chongming; Liu Songtao, 38 years old, from Chongming; Jin Liyou, 51 years old, from Jiangbei; Liu Songfu, 53 years old, from Chongming; Tang Diangen, 45 years old, from Jiangbei; Zhou Dexing, 30 years old, from Jiangbei; Yan Yitai, 26 years old, from Jiangbei; Zhao Yunqing, 27 years old, from Hebei; Li A'er, 28 years old, from Hebei; Liu Zhengke, 37 years old, from Jiangbei; Liu Baobao, 3 years old, from Jiangbei; Zhou Xiaomao, female, 8 years old, from Jiangbei; Yuan Zhao's wife, 30 years old, from Jiangbei; Yuan Huaiyuan, 7 years old, female, from Jiangbei. Only three people were sent to Baolong Hospital, namely Xu Guofu, 56 years old, from Yangzhou; Gu Xiaofuzi, male, 5 years old, from Qingjiang; and Xu Zaiqin, 15 years old, from Yangzhou. Those sent to Tongren Hospital included Xie Genfa, 25 years old; Zhu Minfang, 24 years old; Yu Shilin, 30 years old; Zhou Anshi, 15 years old; Wang Qilin, 31 years old; Qian Yixiang, 30 years old; Wang Caixin, 27 years old; Wang Fusheng, 51 years old; Chen Linfa, 14 years old; Liu Jingyu, 18 years old; Chen Yangqin, 21 years old; Zhao Lianquan, 19 years old; Zhu Shizu, 25 years old; Zhang Zuwen, 31 years old; Zhou Yisheng, 65 years old; Feng Yijie, 29 years old; and Jin Zhengchang, 45 years old. In addition, there were 22 slightly injured people who were bandaged and discharged from the hospital. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the factory and the police. The most tragic thing is that dozens of family members of the workers, whose children and husbands are missing, are carrying paper lanterns and rushing to the scene of the accident to search, their eyes filled with tears, and it is unbearable to see.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Polish Community Celebrates Maritime Day Today <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Polish Embassy and Consulates Take a Day Off; Promoting Overseas Development</p>
<p>June 29th (today) is Polish Maritime Day. Polish communities throughout the country and around the world celebrate this day with grand festivities every year. This holiday was initiated by the Polish Maritime Community Association and officially designated as a national maritime holiday starting in 1932 with national support. Every year on this day, representatives from various regions gather in the newly built Port of Gdynia in Poland to celebrate. The number of attendees is always over 100,000 people. During the event, boats and trains are ordered to sell the cheapest round-trip tickets for the public. At last year's conference, three matters were resolved: (1) The United Nations and all sectors raised funds to build naval defense; (2) The national youth were mobilized to do their best to serve Poland's maritime interests; (3) The Maritime Community Association was actively expanded, and members were widely recruited. The meaning of Maritime Day is to arouse public interest in maritime affairs and seek development overseas. In other words, it confirms that the prosperity of any country depends on the expansion of maritime power. Polish overseas trade has always relied on the Free City of Danzig as its only seaport for transportation. Later, as commercial activities continued to develop, the idea of building a new seaport on purely Polish soil emerged. Gdynia was selected and construction began in 1924, progressing rather slowly. It was not until 1926, when the late General Piłsudski resumed power, that construction was actively promoted, and progress was exceptionally rapid. Today, it is a modern, purely Polish free seaport. Ten years ago, Gdynia was just a small fishing village with only over 500 residents. Today, the population has increased to 55,000 people, and the tonnage of goods imported and exported ranks first among the ports of the Baltic Sea and fourth in mainland Europe. In 1924, the total tonnage of cargo handled by the port was only 10,167 tons. By last year, it had reached 7,191,912 tons, which shows its progress. The success of the port's construction has raised the national interest in direct contact with the sea. In fact, it can be said to be the greatest proof of Poland's coastal and maritime interests. The local Polish community committee in this city will also hold grand celebrations today to commemorate this most interesting maritime festival. The Polish embassy and consulates in this city will also be closed for one day today.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Fire at Ranming Silk Factory on Tianbao Road, Zhabei <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Three Injured Jumping from Windows; Losses Estimated at Over Ten Thousand Gold</p>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, after all the workers at the Ranming Silk Factory at No. 5, Weaving Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei, had finished their night shift and were resting in their dormitories, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the three-story workshop. It was late at night, and the workers were sound asleep, so they did not notice. As a result, the fire spread rapidly and uncontrollably. It was not until the entire factory was on fire and the dormitory building where the workers lived was burned that it was discovered, but it was already too late to save anything. The workers fled for their lives, and the neighbors on both sides were also awakened, rushing to escape with their suitcases and children. At that time, the factory director, Fan Ziqing, from Huzhou, 29 years old, and the staff members Chen Pengfei, from Hangzhou, 30 years old, and Hu Renchu, from Xiamen, 24 years old, were trapped by the smoke. To avoid being buried in the fire, they jumped from the windows on the upper floor but were burned and suffered minor leg injuries. Fortunately, the Hongzhen fire brigade in that section had received a report and quickly dispatched fire trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, the fire was intensifying and was about to spread to the neighboring Dade Rubber Factory and other buildings. They notified the fire brigades in each section of Zhabei to dispatch fire trucks to assist. After the firefighters bravely fought the fire, they managed to protect the neighboring factories from spreading. However, the Ranming Silk Factory had been completely destroyed. The fire was gradually extinguished at around 5:00 AM. The total loss is estimated to be over ten thousand gold. All the injured were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment in ambulances. The cause of the fire is said to be various, and the police are currently investigating.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Yao Guisheng et al. Accused of Embezzling Three Million: <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Plaintiff Repeatedly Sues; Judge Refuted Claim in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Yao Tangshi, an elderly woman from Changzhou currently residing at No. 13, Gufuli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, accompanied by her son, Yao Fulin, hired lawyers Zhang Shewo and Hu Zhigang to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Yao Guisheng, Yao Ge's wife, Yao Dehua, and their family, residing at No. 8, Rongshengli, Anna Kim Road, French Concession, of embezzling three million gold in property. Yao Guisheng was arrested by the French police in January of this year for a case and transferred to the Second Special Court for trial and sentenced to four years and four months in prison, with a fine of four thousand yuan. He is currently appealing to the Third Branch of the High Court. The Second Special Court, based on the lawsuit filed by Yao Tangshi and her son, held a trial yesterday in the Fifth Criminal Court, presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo and Court Clerk Gao Yanmao. The plaintiffs, mother and son, did not appear in person but were represented by lawyers Zhang and Hu. The defendants Yao Guisheng and his wife, accompanied by their defense lawyer Shi Liang, appeared in court. Yao Dehua was absent due to being away from Shanghai. The court first questioned both parties about their ages and hometowns. Lawyers Zhang and Hu successively stated the intent of the prosecution, saying that the plaintiff Yao Tangshi is 60 years old, from Changzhou, residing at No. 13, Gufuli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. Yao Fulin is 22 years old, the son of Yao Tangshi, with the same address. The late husband of the plaintiff Yao Tangshi, Mr. Binggui, and the first defendant Yao Guisheng were brothers. Mr. Binggui did business in Shanghai during the late Qing Dynasty and later invited the first defendant to Shanghai to operate the business. After Yao Binggui passed away in 1918, all of the ancestral property was managed by Yao Guisheng. For decades, he managed the business well and accumulated assets of three million. The plaintiff Yao Tangshi and her sons Fulin and Fumin originally lived with Yao Guisheng. However, in 1933, the first defendant expelled the plaintiff and her sons. The plaintiff requested a division of the property, but he ignored them. The first defendant is indeed guilty of embezzling property, and the second defendant Yao Ge's wife and the third defendant Yao Dehua are suspected of secretly obstructing the division of property and embezzling it from each other. They requested that the court investigate and prosecute according to the law. The defendant Yao Guisheng testified that he is 49 years old and his deceased brother Binggui passed away in 1918, leaving behind a document for 16 mu of farmland in Huangtang Town, Benniu, Changzhou, which was entrusted to me for safekeeping by Yao Bingyuan and relatives from the same clan, but the rent collection was still managed by my sister-in-law. Besides that, there was no ancestral property. Even the funeral expenses of my deceased brother were paid by me. I do some business in Shanghai and have accumulated some savings, but it is not as much as the plaintiff said. My sister-in-law and Yao Fukang have repeatedly used litigation to blackmail me and make things difficult for me. I was arrested and imprisoned this time and am currently appealing. They are making false accusations, etc. Then Yao's defense lawyer, Shi Liang, stood up and stated to the court that the case has significant problems in procedure. (1) According to the argument of the plaintiff's agent, they are co-residing with shared property. According to Article 339 of the Criminal Procedure Law, they are fundamentally not allowed to file a private prosecution. (2) The plaintiff is now accusing the defendants of embezzlement. According to Article 361, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, it must be prosecuted upon complaint. According to Article 218 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the complaint should be filed within six months of discovering the embezzlement. Now the plaintiff's agent claims that they only found out in 1933, which is past the statutory time limit for the complaint period. (3) The plaintiff Yao Tangshi, Yao Fukang, Yao Fulin, etc., have successively accused the defendants of embezzlement four times since April last year. The first time, after the trial in your court, it was ruled inadmissible on April 24th because it did not meet the private prosecution procedure. The second time, they filed a lawsuit in your court, and it was ruled inadmissible on February 12th of this year. The third time, they reported to the police, but it was not accepted due to false evidence. Now, for the fourth time, they are filing a private prosecution and entanglement. According to the principle of "one matter, no further action," it should be ruled inadmissible. Also, the litigation goals of the plaintiffs are inconsistent. The first private prosecution accused the embezzlement of 160,000 of land. This time, the police report also accuses the embezzlement of 16 mu of land, and also accusing the embezzlement of three million. Furthermore, the son of the plaintiff Yao Tangshi, Fukang, has repeatedly failed in litigation, first issued leaflets and undermined the reputation, and in January of this year, colluded with bad people to falsely accuse Yao Guisheng of operating the Jingwan business, which caused the defendant to be intimidated. Due to these various reasons, please pay attention to it, the court, etc. After reviewing the evidence, the court ordered the lawyers from both sides to argue and then announced the conclusion, ruling that the case was not accepted.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Citizens on Nanjing Road Firmly Demand Rent Reduction <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Organize into Groups to Consolidate Unity; Resolved to Abide by Agreed-Upon Cases Together</p>
<p>Shop tenants along Nanjing Road in this city are mostly unable to bear the burden due to the impact of the declining market. Their rent expenses account for more than half of their total expenses. Therefore, they have successively returned to the Citizens' First District Branch to which the area belongs, requesting leadership in carrying out rent reductions. After accepting the opinions of its members, the branch has repeatedly convened all road tenants to discuss concrete implementation methods. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, another joint meeting of each small group was held. Tang Xuanxiang, representative of the Dalun Group, was publicly elected as chairman. First, representatives from each group reported on the progress. The methods of each group were quite thorough, and the unanimous and firm expression was particularly intense. A total of 163 people attended, belonging to 7 landlords. Among them, four landlords have already agreed to reduce rent, but the discount has not yet been negotiated. The final resolution methods are: (1) Each tenant will reduce rent starting from June; (2) The rent for June will be stored separately by each group in a designated bank; (3) If any dispute arises due to the rent reduction movement, all tenants on the road will provide unified assistance; (4) If one company comes to an agreement with the landlord and violates the motion, they will be attacked by the group; (5) Other secrets. By the time the meeting adjourned, it was already dusk.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Accumulated Profits of the Hua Ying Pharmacy Over the Years Are All Paper Wealth: Uncollectible Payments Are Also Listed as Assets; In Reality, the Business Has Incurred Losses Every Year <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>—The Trial Concluded Yesterday and Sentencing is Scheduled for Today—</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court continued the trial of the case involving the Hua Ying Pharmacy owing deposits to various households. The supervisors of Hua Ying, except for Zhang Liming, who remained absent, all other supervisors, including Zhang Xianda, Zhuang Zichen, Tong Guangfu, Zhang Duchen, and Liu Tingxian, appeared in court with their defense lawyer Mai Fenling. In addition to Zhang Meiling and others, lawyer Tong Yuwen also represented the remaining 80,000 yuan in creditor participation. Judge Feng announced that the court would now investigate the allegations by the plaintiff Zhang Meiling that the defendants deliberately inflated the price of the pharmacy's inventory and other items that should not be listed as assets but were still listed by the defendants. He then ordered the plaintiff to present evidence. The plaintiff's agent lawyer, Wu Linkun, then revealed the accounts of the pharmacy from 1928 to last year, which he believed were fraudulent, one by one. He stated that, according to the defendants' business report for 1928, the profit was 9,058 yuan. However, the items listed as assets, such as house construction costs, old accounts of various households, temporary account names, and the cost of the Housing Association, as well as checks that are like waste paper, totaling 32,687 yuan, should either be expenses or are impossible to collect. How can they still be considered assets? If the above items are excluded from the asset column, there would not only be no profit of over 9,000 yuan, but also a loss of over 23,600 yuan. That year, the pharmacy's capital was 66,000 yuan, and after deducting the losses, only 30,000 yuan remained. The business report for 1929 stated a profit of over 22,600 yuan. However, if the 57,000 yuan listed as assets that were not actually assets were excluded, there should be a loss of over 34,600 yuan that year. The capital remaining from the previous year was completely gone. However, the business report for 1930 was increased to 100,000 yuan, claiming a profit of over 32,000 yuan. The income, however, suddenly increased from 1,000 to 5,000. Other payments that should be excluded from the asset column totaled 57,330 yuan, so the actual loss that year was still over 25,000 yuan. The business report for 1931 stated a profit of over 22,380 yuan. That year, the assets that should be excluded totaled 95,400 yuan, so the losses that year totaled over 73,000 yuan. Although they still claimed a profit of over 16,000 yuan in 1932, the actual losses were over 67,000 yuan. In 1933, they claimed a profit of over 10,700 yuan, but the items that should be excluded from the asset column totaled over 104,000 yuan, so the final depreciation was over 92,000 yuan. The so-called cash on hand in the past years' reports was actually a kind of outstanding debt, and the so-called profit was all paper wealth. Lawyer Wu finally requested the court to question the defendants about the various items in the temporary accounts, such as the 4,000 yuan owed by Zhang Zilian of the National Goods Market. Is there any possibility of repayment, and is there any possibility of cashing the expired checks? He also requested that the checks be submitted to the court for review. Then the defendant Zhang Xianda stated that the pharmacy had made profits in previous years, and only lost more than 20,000 yuan last year. Judge Feng then announced that the sentencing would be on Saturday afternoon of this week after the lawyers from both sides had argued.</p>

<p>The board of directors of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society convened a meeting yesterday to discuss how to provide relief to the 40,000 rickshaw pullers in this city during the summer. Attendees included Mai Xi (Chairman), Wang Zhiren, Qiu Zitong, Zhu Maocheng, Yin Zhigui, Tao Deman, Peng Jin, Ying Shugui, Xie Andao, and Gu Songmao. As a result of the discussion, the following summer service relief measures were proposed: (1) Set up more tea urns. In addition to the tea urns already in place at various locations, add 20 more tea urns in the Public Concession and neighboring areas for a period of three months, from July to the end of September; (2) Provide refreshing medicine and distribute it to all members for self-collection; (3) Three new clinics have been established. Locations have already been found, and more experienced doctors and nurses should be hired immediately, so that the number of patients treated by the newly established clinics has reached more than 23,000; (4) In addition to the free bathhouses already in place, more hygienic bathhouses with low costs should be added in Zhabei and Nanshi; (5) Attention should be paid to family visits and expanded further.

<h3 id="e111">Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau – Reorganization of Yangtze River Steamship Order <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>First Eliminate Peddlers and Other Unaffiliated Persons, Discussing Elimination Methods to be Followed</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the order on the Yangtze River steamships of the Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau has always been extremely chaotic and criticized by society. Now the heads of various departments of the bureau have decided to gradually and effectively reorganize it. The first step is to eliminate peddlers and other unaffiliated persons. After discussing ten elimination methods with Pan Suizhang, the director of the Xiaguan Ship Inspection Office, they have been printed and distributed to the managers of various Yangtze River branch offices and the business directors of each ship for their information. The methods are as follows: (1) Peddlers on board have been strictly prohibited (handled by military police in conjunction with ship staff); (2) It has been decided to subsidize refugees' meals on the ship at 20 cents per person; (3) Refugees taking the ship are required to stay on both sides of the engine room as designated areas, with fences to separate them to avoid disturbances (already implemented on the Jiangshun, Jiang'an, Wanghua, and Jiangxin ships); (4) Persons picking up passengers at various ports are not allowed to enter or linger (it has been found that the selling of cigarettes on board is done by poor people, and punishment has been carried out on the Jiangshun ship); (5) Tea sellers on board will be expelled (passengers already have tea served by the tea room, and these people secretly collude with pickpockets; this has been discovered on the Jiangshun ship, and they have been arrested and punished); (6) Female servants should be hired on the ship to inspect female passengers to avoid accidents; (7) Inspection facilities should be built at each dock; (8) Jiang has already built them, but Nanjing is still lacking; (Jiujiang has already built them, but Nanjing is still lacking); (8) Now that it is summer, hygiene facilities should be implemented quickly (the military police, together with the purser, will urge the tea room staff to clean at all times, and more spittoons should be placed, and more disinfectant should be sprayed to prevent epidemics); (9) Order of boarding and disembarking should be strictly maintained (passengers often crowd the sides of the ship before arriving at the shore, blocking traffic; the military police, together with the purser, will stop passengers from rushing and pushing 30 minutes before the ship stops to avoid danger); (10) Ship employees must cooperate with the military police (the military police protecting the ship are closely related to the interests of the ship, so everything should be discussed and handled together, and no prejudice should be allowed to avoid estrangement).</p>

<p>Both Eyes Unable to Open - The Bandits' Plan Was Cunning</p>
<p>Chengmei Small Cigarette Paper Shop, located in the middle section of Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession, also deals in money exchange of silver dollars. Yesterday (28th) at around 10 a.m., an apprentice, Zhang Qianhua, was sent to carry banknotes, about a thousand yuan, intending to go to various shops to collect copper coins and silver coins. Unexpectedly, as he walked out of the shop and headed south, he encountered a bandit at the intersection of Jiujiang Road. The bandit violently threw pepper powder at Zhang's face, causing Zhang's eyes to be injured and unable to open. The bandit then snatched the bag of banknotes from Zhang and fled. Zhang shouted loudly for robbery, and passersby gathered, but the bandit had already disappeared without a trace. He then went to the Old Gate Patrol Station to request an investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Solar Black Spots are Larger - This Year May Not Be Too Hot - Hurricane Warning Method Changes Next Month - Broadcast by the Central Yangming Institute <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Regarding hurricane warnings, which are crucial for the safety of shipowners and fishermen, the Ministry of Industry previously consulted the Ministry of Communications to have the Xujiahui Observatory provide free information to the Shanghai Radio Station, which would then relay it to coastal provinces and cities to inform nearby shipowners and fishermen, in order to protect the safety of fishermen in various fishing areas. Now, the Ministry of Communications believes that there are no restrictions on the number of meteorological telegrams sent from various places, which not only congests the lines but also delays them due to repeated forwarding, thus rendering them ineffective. Therefore, it has been decided to change the method on the first of next month. From then on, the Central Yangming Institute will provide Yangming reports and hurricane warnings. These telegrams can only be sent to the district center radio stations within each district and then broadcast wirelessly. It has also been agreed with the Central Broadcasting Station to report from the first of next month, with the times being 9:30 a.m., 12:00 noon, 5:00 p.m., and 8:00 p.m., four times. In addition, the Academia Sinica predicts that this summer's heat will be lower than last year because the black spots in the sun are larger than last year. Therefore, it will not be as hot as last year.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Xie Yibin Has Many Family Disputes <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>A Zhenjiang Woman Claiming to be Xie's Concubine Sends a Letter Through a Lawyer Demanding Monthly Expenses</p>
<p>Xie Yibin, a compradore of Mei Zuishi Foreign Firm and a Cantonese, has many children. After his wife, Ms. Chen, passed away, he married Ms. Zheng as his second wife. However, Xie's fourth son, Guozhen, disagreed with Ms. Zheng, so he rented a separate house and lived apart from his father. This spring, Ms. Zheng and Guozhen had a conflict over a minor matter. Ms. Shan filed a complaint with the patrol station for assault. Since then, the relationship between father and son has also broken down. Xie Yibin also sued his son in court for certain amounts of money, while Guozhen's wife and his sister-in-law also sued Xie for living expenses. Lawsuits have been filed one after another. While these family disputes have not yet been resolved, a woman from Zhenjiang, Ms. She (41 years old), came to Mei Zuishi Foreign Firm last month on the 30th to see Xie Yibin, claiming to be Xie's concubine and demanding considerable assets. After Xie drove her away, she soon hired lawyer Ma Leiming to send a letter to Xie, claiming that when she was 17 years old, Xie took her as a concubine and lived with his first wife, Ms. Chen. At the age of 21, she gave birth to a son who died twelve days later. Since Ms. Chen passed away, she has been promoted to the position of principal wife. However, Xie later married Ms. Zheng as his second wife and therefore expelled Ms. She. Initially, he paid considerable expenses on a monthly basis, but now he has stopped paying. He urged her to take care of him quickly. After receiving the letter, Xie believed that all the statements made by Ms. She were completely baseless and seriously affected his reputation, and that she was trying to defraud him. He hired lawyer Ge Jiqi to file a complaint with the First Special Court, suing Ms. She criminally for defamation and fraud. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, Judge Feng Shide opened the first criminal court for interrogation. Xie Yibin did not attend, but lawyer Ge attended on his behalf. According to lawyer Ge, the defendant was formerly a servant in the plaintiff's house and was expelled by the plaintiff for improper behavior. Unexpectedly, recently, at the instigation of the plaintiff's son, Guozhen, and others, she claimed to be a member of the plaintiff's family and came to the foreign firm to see him. After being driven away, she hired a lawyer to send a letter, which greatly damaged the plaintiff's reputation. Therefore, he had no choice but to pursue the matter. However, because the evidence was not yet complete, he requested a postponement. Ms. She stated that when Xie was a compradore in Zhenjiang, he took her as a concubine. After Ms. Zheng entered the family, she was expelled and lived in the plaintiff's Da'an residence. Later, she returned to Zhenjiang. The court asked if she had any evidence. She replied that apart from the plaintiff's son and daughter-in-law, it was difficult to collect other evidence. Lawyer Ge immediately stated that the son and daughter-in-law mentioned by the defendant were Xie Guozhen, who was involved in a lawsuit with his father. Judge Feng verified the testimony and ordered a postponement for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The National Government's aviation highway construction lottery tickets have been sold for twelve issues. The office has now presented the Ministry of Finance to change the prize amounts, etc., from the thirteenth issue onwards. The new lottery tickets have been printed and distributed, and the draw is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on August 9th. Afterwards, it will be held once a month. The modified method is recorded below:</p>
<p>Total Number of Lottery Tickets - Changed to 300,000</p>
<p>The total number of lottery tickets was originally 500,000, each costing ten yuan, and sold in ten series. It has now been changed to 300,000, still divided into ten series, and drawn once a month. The winning numbers have been changed as follows: one first prize winner wins 250,000 yuan; four second prize winners win 50,000 yuan each; twenty third prize winners win 10,000 yuan each; one hundred fourth prize winners win 2,000 yuan each; three hundred fifth prize winners win 500 yuan each; six hundred sixth prize winners win 100 yuan each. The upper and lower consecutive numbers of the first prize have two additional prizes, each winning 6,000 yuan; the upper and lower consecutive numbers of the second prize have eight additional prizes, each winning 1,000 yuan; the last two characters of the first prize are the same for 2,999 tickets, each winning 50 yuan; the last character of the first prize is the same for 27,000 tickets, each winning 10 yuan. The total number of winning lottery tickets is 31,034, and the total prize money is 1,499,950 yuan.</p>
<p>Drawing Method - Also Changed</p>
<p>The number of winning numbers has increased, and the drawing method has also changed. There are still two types of prize balls, A and B, from 00 to 299, a total of 3,000. The prize balls for the prize levels are from the first prize to the fourth prize, a total of 125. The prize balls for the fifth and sixth prizes use the B balls. For the fifth prize, one is drawn, and those with the same last three characters win. For the sixth prize, two are drawn, the same as the fifth prize. The remaining additional prizes are based on the numbers of the first and second prizes and are not drawn separately. Therefore, although the prize levels have increased, the drawing method is simple and clear, so as not to prolong the time.</p>
<p>This Issue's Sales - Similar to Before</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the office, the method of changing the prize numbers has been determined, but it is still striving to be simple and clear so that the audience can understand it at a glance. Also, the unsold lottery tickets from the previous issue were sold by the China Aviation Construction Association. It has not yet been decided whether to follow this method this time. As for the sales volume of this issue, it is similar to previous issues, but there are occasional rumors in the north, so the sales volume is affected. After the change, the sales will definitely increase due to the greater chance of winning.</p>

The legal reorganization will be implemented.</p>
<p>Asking for Instructions from the Ministry - Shen Shuyu, the director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, was instructed by the ministry to start the reorganization and sent Wang Zhijing, the director of the secretariat of the bureau, to the Ministry of Communications to ask for instructions on all reorganization procedures.

<p>Liu Boye, the director of the Minsheng Management Committee of the China Jishi Conference in Qixian County, Henan, reported that the county borrowed 30,000 yuan from Fusun Company through your association in 1930 to complete the construction of the canal, irrigating 100,000 mu of farmland and repairing culverts, sluice gates, and bridges. The benefits are extremely widespread. After the canal was built, there was a bumper harvest every year. Last year, due to the trouble caused by unscrupulous people stealing water, the lawsuit lasted for years. The fields related to the canal water have already harvested in the summer and are expected to have a bumper harvest in the autumn. If it were not for your association's benevolent loan, how could we have obtained this great benefit? The association believes that since the completion of this canal, regardless of drought or flood, there has been a bumper harvest for many years, and there are records in the reports. It has already replied in a letter yesterday that this canal was originally an ancient canal that had not been repaired for a long time, and droughts and floods occurred repeatedly. Now that it has been repaired, it has been harvested, and it is necessary to pay attention to annual repairs and keep it intact to benefit for a hundred years and save people from the suffering of disasters. With frequent droughts and floods, people cannot live. Although the weather is erratic, water conservancy has not been emphasized. Now the government is paying attention to disaster relief and is handling Wang Zhen's agricultural loans. If charitable organizations at home and abroad and local people can repair water conservancy, they can make up for the inconsistency of the weather and provide security for the people. It is the most important thing to relieve disaster and reduce calamities.</p>

All parts are steel and concrete structures with rubber floors. The cost of purchasing various testing machines is 120,000 yuan, which have now been purchased and transported to Shanghai. There are various torsion, friction, fatigue, and other testing machines, as well as the most urgently needed chemical instruments, worth more than 40,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e125">Wujiang Native Place Association - Telegram Requests the Removal of Taihu Lake Enclosure Fields <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Wujiang Native Place Association in Shanghai submitted a document to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, saying to Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, and Shen, Director of the Department of Construction, saying: The country is based on agriculture, and the wealth of Jiangnan is the best in the world, which is actually due to the gift of Taihu Lake. If Taihu Lake loses its effectiveness, then the prosperity of Su will gradually decline. The cheap grain damaged agriculture two years ago, and the severe drought raged last year. The rural areas went bankrupt, and the social economy gradually shrank. This is clear evidence. In drought, the water dries up, so it is appropriate to dredge urgently. The government does not add dredging governance, and the local customers collude, so they made large-scale enclosure fields. The enclosed fields are about 18 li long from north to south and about 6 li wide from east to west, and there are five or six companies. Their offices are all set up in Wujiang. The Wujiang County magistrate patrolled in disguise at the beginning of his tenure to investigate the social situation. How could he have heard nothing about this matter? Until the matter was exposed, the county committee and the gentry and people went to the lake to conduct a field survey, submitted a request to dismantle the enclosure, and then Jiang and Wu counties promoted to the province one after another, and said in person that Wei Tai had clearly ordered that the machine was still under investigation. Now that two sentences have passed, what about the investigation? I have not seen the bulletin. It is rumored that only the Songling Songchang built by the local people is being demolished, and the ones surrounded by the guest people have not been demolished. (Omission) The water conservancy of Taihu Lake is related to the livelihood of the people of Su, Zhejiang, and seven prefectures, and no one can slaughter it, especially a few people who can monopolize it. (Omission) Now check the enclosure fields in Wu County, and most of them have been removed, with no repercussions. However, in Wujiang, when it was first proposed to dismantle it, those people arbitrarily resisted. The background in this is obvious. (Omission) Our chairman and hall leader must consider carefully and treat the symptoms and root causes. However, there is another severe drought this year, and the downstream needs water urgently. If the deep abyss in the lower reaches of Wusong is blocked, it will not be restored, then the move to deepen the Ji mound and dredge the Songjiang will be meaningless. Not only will the farmland transportation in the three prefectures of Su, Song, and Tai be greatly affected, but also. For this reason, I implore your seat to quickly order the Wujiang County magistrate to dismantle all the groups, and order the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Project Office to plan and dredge as soon as possible. Waiting for Mingxun, I can't wait any longer. I respectfully state that the members of the Wujiang Native Place Association in Shanghai, Xu Peihuang, and others kowtow together.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Xing Zhigang Asks Five Provincial Transportation Orders - To Reduce the Shanghai-Minhang Car Price <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang and others, citizens of Shanghai County, submitted a document to the Transportation Committee of the five provinces and cities of Su, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Beijing-Shanghai yesterday, saying that the Shanghai-Minhang Automobile Company is holding up the car price and disrespecting the government. They urged the city government to correct it quickly to benefit highway transportation. The document stated: According to the standards of the general rules for passenger transportation by highway vehicles in the five provinces and cities, the price is three cents per person per kilometer. Now, the Shanghai-Minhang Automobile Company charges 75 cents for the entire 29-kilometer journey. In fact, because the round-trip ticket price of the Shanghai-Minhang ship is low, it does not seem to exceed the stipulated car price, holding this to cover up the eyes and ears of the authorities. But if you look at the content, the price from Qianliang Temple to Wujia Lane is 1.5 cents for two kilometers, from Wujia Lane to Huiling Middle School is 1.5 cents for 1.9 kilometers, from Huiling Middle School to Caohejing is 1.5 cents for 1.6 kilometers, and from Caohejing to Tushanwan is 1.5 cents for 1.9 kilometers. When the car is driving, each station is less than three minutes, and each station sells 1.5 cents, which exceeds the stipulated car price by more than half. Only the section from Tushanwan to the Shanghai Local Office, which is 6.4 kilometers, takes 12 minutes, and the fare is 20 cents, which is in line with the standard price. This section is because there is a Longhua car run by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau nearby. The journey is longer, but it only sells for 480 yuan, which is 1.5 cents, which is in proportion, so the Shanghai-Minhang company cannot increase its price deliberately. The people have repeatedly submitted requests to the municipal authorities to inform the company to reduce the car price in order to develop the traffic on this road and prosper the city. The reply to reduce prices was not obtained. It is found that the Shanghai-Minhang car is the throat of the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway and the lifeline of Shanghai-Minhang commerce. In the autumn of rural bankruptcy, it is very appropriate to abide by the government's order and work together to overcome difficulties. It should not be contrary to the government's intentions and create this deformed car price and be criticized by the local area. The people will ask the council to strictly enforce the order, unify the road rights, develop the enterprises along the road, and for the sake of transportation, especially provide words and earnestly ask your seat to look at the facts, quickly give advice to the Shanghai Municipal Government, and inform the Shanghai-Minhang Automobile Company to abide by the five-province and city highway car passenger transportation rules, quickly reduce the car price, and issue round-trip tickets at each station, which are sold at 70% of the round-trip car price, and add a 12 o'clock bus once to benefit travelers and facilitate transportation. I can't wait any longer.</p>

<p>The Shanghai China Football Team will depart this afternoon at 3:00 PM on the French postal ship Armis to Java. There are nineteen members of the team, led by Rong Qizhao. Yu Hengzhi, the team's manager, published an article on the team's organization, for the public to know the truth.</p>
<p>Full Team List</p>
<p>(Leader) Rong Qizhao (Manager) Yu Hengzhi (Team Members) Xu Ting, Li Ning, Jiang Shanjing, Guan Xun'an, Liang Shutang, Xu Jingcheng, Chen Zhenxiang, Jiang Lu, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu, Jin Yongsen, Zheng Jiliang, Cao Guicheng, Mai Su, Li Guozhao, He Jiaqiang</p>
<p>Announcement of Process</p>
<p>Since winning both the International Cup of the Nations Football Tournament and the Sino-Portuguese International Cup, the Shanghai China Football Team has become famous overseas. People from all regions of the South Seas Islands have repeatedly expressed their admiration for the high skills of domestic teams in competitions and their remarkable achievements. The Java Qunli Sports Association sent a letter to the National Sports Federation of China inviting the Shanghai China Team to compete there during the summer vacation, to broaden the horizons of overseas Chinese and to learn from others. All travel expenses and accommodation are to be borne by the Association. The Federation, considering the upcoming National Games and the World Games in Germany next year, intended to train talents. These opportunities were highly desirable, not only for the individual achievements of the players but also for the cultivation of talents in Shanghai and the country. The intention was good, and the effect was grand. Why not do it? The Federation immediately accepted and commissioned the China Football Committee to carefully discuss and prepare the team. I, Yu, was commissioned to be the manager, and I contacted the team members of the China Team. Everyone expressed their sympathy and was ready to go. They trained in Shen Garden at 6:00 AM every day to gather strength so that they would not disappoint the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese. However, due to the professional relationships of each person, it was necessary to formally request leave from their respective institutions in both the public and private sectors. After a month, the good things were difficult to achieve. Some players could not travel as they wished. The reason was that some people held the view of promoting football, but they only had a limited view. The purpose of sports is to increase the health of the people and is closely related to the strength of the country. Sitting in a well and watching the sky is definitely not the perspective that should be had when promoting sports. There are many talented people in the team, and it is not possible to stop the southern expedition because of the absence of a few players. The other party hopes for a strong Chinese team, and we are afraid of disappointing the enthusiasm of the people there. Therefore, we had no choice but to invite players from Hong Kong to make up for the shortfall. The main purpose of this trip is to train talents. Whether it is Hong Kong or Shanghai, they belong to the same country. This strategy cannot be said to be wrong. It is regrettable that I, who is committed to promotion, am willing to tie and untie the bell, which is contrary to my original intention. Before leaving, I would like to inform you of the process and hope that all sectors of society will understand the imperfections of the handling. (Yu Hengzhi)</p>
<p>Very Strong Strength</p>
<p>There are seventeen members of the team, plus the leader and manager, for a total of nineteen people. The players were originally selected from Shanghai, but Zhang Yecai, Chen Hongguang, Feng Yunyou, Gu Shangquan, Jia Youliang and others were unable to travel due to other engagements. Therefore, they had no choice but to invite Mai Su, Li Guozhao, Cao Zhucheng, He Jiacheng, and Zheng Jiliang, who had already gone to Singapore, to join the team (twelve people from Shanghai). It is planned to have a total of fifteen games in Java. The number of matches that will be arranged when visiting other locations is not included. It is expected to return home in early September. The team's forward power is the strongest, and the mid-line is weaker, but Li Guozhao's ball skills have reached the upper level and can still cope. The defense is similar to the mid-line. However, it is said that Mai Su's skills are second to none in Hong Kong, and he is even better than Li Tiansheng. Unfortunately, there is only one goalkeeper, Xu Heng. If there are no special circumstances, he should be able to complete the task happily. In short, the team's strength is sufficient, and it is expected that this trip will have satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The Preparatory Committee for the Shanghai Preliminary of the Sixth National Games held its first meeting at Yipinxiang yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members</p>
<p>Including Director Pan, Shen Siliang, Jiang Jianbai, Shao Rugan, Rong Qizhao, Wang Fudan, Ling Xitao, Jiang Xiangqing, Ma Chonggan, Chen Gongtai, Chen Yongcheng, Yu Hengzhi, Zhang Zizhen, Zhou Jiaqi, Shi Zhiqian, Qu Yue, Wang Zhuangfei, Wang Keyong, Hu Zongfan, Shen Kunnan, Lu Lihua, Yu Ziyu, Zhang Yuansheng, Le Xiule, Jiang Lianggui, Lu Zhongen, Zhou Junren, Chen Bingde, Li Feiyun, Peng Sanmei, Chen Xuliang, Tong Zhongyi, Liu Desheng, Zhu Lianxiang, Luo Shuqing, Chen Weiming, Ye Dami, and other thirty people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Pan reported that today is the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Shanghai Preliminary of the Sixth National Games. Now, as the date of the National Games is approaching and the summer vacation is near, how should our city's representatives to the National Games be selected, and what should be the training arrangements after the selection? Detailed discussions should be held. Shen Siliang also put forward his opinions, advocating that a large-scale sports meeting should not be held to save expenses, and put forward several methods for joint discussion and publication of opinions.</p>
<p>Decision Principles</p>
<p>The principle was immediately decided. This year, the method of item-by-item selection will be adopted, and no centralized preliminary meeting will be held. The selection methods, training methods, locations, dates, and expenses for each sport will be decided by the respective selection committees, and then reported to the Education Bureau for review. Then, the various selection committees will hold group meetings, followed by a gathering for dinner.</p>
<p>Track and Field Training</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of sending track and field athletes to Qingdao for summer training, it was decided that the Municipal Education Bureau would formally send Dong Shuzhao, Jia Lianren, Wang Zhenglin, Wang He, Zhang Jiakui, Gong Wanyu, Chen Jiayou, and Sun Huibei to Qingdao for training. In addition, a summer training camp for male and female track and field athletes will be set up in Shanghai. All athletes who participated in the International Games this year, except for the eight selected to go to Qingdao for training, are expected to stay in Shanghai for training during the summer vacation. The list of six people sent by the Municipal Education Bureau that was reported yesterday is not accurate. The above-mentioned eight selected people must bring their two-inch photos to the Municipal Central District Education Bureau for registration next Monday (July 1).</p>
<p>Track and Field All-Around</p>
<p>According to Shen Siliang's written opinion on the preliminary competition, individual preliminary competitions will be held for each sport. For male and female track and field and all-around events, the top ten outstanding athletes of both genders will be selected based on their usual results and sent to the Qingdao summer training class for training. Another training class will be organized in Shanghai to train the second-tier players as a group. If necessary, another preliminary competition will be held after the summer vacation to supplement the team, so as to avoid any regret.</p>
<p>Football and Baseball</p>
<p>There will be no preliminary competition for the baseball team. The current players from various universities and the China Baseball Team composed of various sectors will be the official representatives to attend the National Games in the future. The team has already participated in the Shanghai Baseball League, which is the best training opportunity. The football team will be based on the twelve Shanghai players from the China Team that are currently on the expedition to Java. In the future, outstanding players who were unable to participate in the expedition due to other matters will be selected to join the team. Therefore, this expedition to the south by the Shanghai China Team is also an excellent preparation for the Shanghai team to attend the National Games.</p>
<p>Volleyball, Basketball, and Volleyball</p>
<p>There will be no separate preliminary competition for men's tennis. The selection committee will observe the level of each person's competition this season and select them. There are many talents in volleyball. In order to establish contact, the selection committee stated that it plans to select the elite of Shanghai to form two teams and train them diligently. Then, a team will be selected from these two teams. The situation in basketball is more difficult and complicated, and preliminary competitions will be necessary. Or, the same method as volleyball can be used, first selecting excellent players to organize two or several teams, and then making further selections.</p>
<p>Men's and Women's Swimming</p>
<p>It is also planned not to hold a preliminary competition. The selection committee will pay attention to the individual results of each person this season and make a preliminary selection. If necessary, a second preliminary selection will be made to supplement the team.</p>
<p>Women's Ball Games</p>
<p>Preliminary competitions must be held for women's basketball, volleyball, softball, and tennis. First, the selection committees will pay attention to the talents of each school, and then hold a preliminary competition in early September. In short, it is estimated that individual preliminary competitions will be used and all efforts will be used for training.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Jiangsu Education Fund Allocation Method: 300,000+ Yuan Allocated This Term <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The monthly education fund allocation for Jiangsu Province is approximately 245,000 yuan. Traditionally, rural normal schools and provincial primary schools receive their allocations half a month earlier, and secondary schools receive them one month earlier than normal schools, vocational schools, and social education institutions. (For example, currently, rural normal schools and provincial primary schools have received allocations up to the first half of June, normal schools, vocational schools, and social education institutions have received allocations up to the second half of May, and secondary schools have received allocations up to the first half of May.) It is reported that the Jiangsu Education Fund Auditing Committee held a meeting on the 25th of this month and has decided on a unified allocation method for the future. This means that the allocation notices issued to all schools and institutions this time will be filled out up to the first half of June for secondary schools. The remaining half of June will be deducted from each secondary school's administrative income to serve as the funding for the second half of June (with adjustments made for surpluses or deficits). For rural normal schools, primary schools, normal schools, vocational schools, and even social education institutions, the allocation notices will all be filled out up to the second half of June. It is also reported that the Jiangsu Education Fund Office is re-issuing the allocation notices (usually filled out for half a month, but now, due to the unified allocation up to the second half of June, additional notices must be filled out). They are requesting that the auditors sign each one and that the Education Department affix its seal. At the same time, personnel are being dispatched to urge each county to submit their education funds. It is estimated that there are over 200,000 yuan in the treasury, but even with the funds remitted by the counties on the 27th, there is still a shortfall of about 100,000 yuan. However, due to the good harvest this season, the counties should be able to remit the remaining 100,000 yuan within the next ten days. To facilitate the allocation of funds to the schools, distributions will begin sequentially after the beginning of July. From July onwards, all schools and institutions will receive their funding in the same month, eliminating the previous discrepancies.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Leave Application Procedures for Primary School Teachers and Staff Attending Summer School: Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Comply <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all municipal and private registered primary schools in this city stating that, upon investigation, many students of this year's summer school for primary school teachers and staff and students of the summer training course for private registered primary school teachers and staff who are serving as heads or deputy heads of sub-groups in the literacy education service corps have applied for leave. A unified approach should be established and ordered to be followed. The order cites Article 7 of the "Guidelines for Sub-Group Work" issued by the Literacy Education Service Corps: "Although there is a summer vacation in July, at least one of the head or deputy head of each sub-group should remain at the school for one or two days each week to provide teaching guidance to the members and training or testing for the public taught by the members of each group." The regulations stipulate that the organization of this service sub-group is based on the school as a unit, that is, each school establishes a sub-group, with the principal as the head and the head teacher as the deputy head. Based on this, it is sufficient for each school to have one person remain at the school for one or two days each week during the summer vacation in July to handle the work of the sub-group. The Bureau now stipulates that each school may allow one head of the sub-group to take leave to return to school to handle the work of the sub-group on Saturdays and Sundays each week during the summer school period. For the rest of the time, they must still attend school as usual. Students serving as deputy heads of the sub-group may not apply for leave separately, so that both the promotion of literacy education and the teacher's own professional development can be taken into account. All schools are ordered to comply with this order, and no disregard is allowed. For schools that have previously submitted special requests for instructions, no further orders will be issued after this general order. Please also be informed. This order.</p>

The building is spacious and well-lit. In order to supplement the academic deficiencies of students inside and outside the school, the school is planning to run a summer remedial school, divided into four groups: senior high school, junior high school, senior primary school, and junior primary school.

<h3 id="e163">A Self-Rescue Plan for the Publishing Industry <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>—Unified Sales Organization—</p>
<p>Currently, the most pressing difficulties for China's publishing industry are: (1) competition among publishers, (2) manipulation by middlemen, (3) difficulty in recovering payments, and (4) challenges in book promotion. I believe that sluggish business and difficulty in capital turnover are secondary, as resolving the former issues would naturally eliminate the latter difficulties.</p>
<p>To solve these four difficulties, publishers must have a fundamental realization: from now on, focus solely on publishing and refrain from engaging in sales. I believe this realization is especially necessary for publishers with small capital. Publishers with large capital can engage in planned production on one hand and establish sales outlets in various locations to distribute books nationwide on the other hand. However, small-capital publishers lack the strength to do so. Conversely, they face oppression from large publishers on one hand and internal strife among peers on the other. Therefore, to resist the oppression of large publishers and seek self-reliance, small publishers today must unite and separate publishing from sales, making them independent operations. Based on this principle of division of labor between production and distribution, I propose that publishers jointly establish a unified sales organization. The reasons and methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Currently, small bookstores must each set up a retail sales department to sell their complete range of books, and these stores must be located on Fuzhou Road, where land prices are very high. The Fuzhou Road area is originally a commercial center. The reason why small bookstores must gather here is partly because large bookstores such as Commercial Press and China Bookstore are located there, and partly because Shanghai lacks a central cultural area, as so-called scholars are scattered in the east, west, north, and south suburbs, not concentrated in one place. Therefore, it is indeed very uneconomical for small bookstores to independently open retail stores on Fuzhou Road. If they can cooperate and establish a general sales organization, it will definitely provide many benefits to each bookstore's finances. Moreover, it is clear that small stores cannot compete with large department stores. Therefore, the establishment of a unified sales organization will inevitably attract more attention from buyers than individual small bookstores. This is the economic saving for publishers, the first benefit.</p>
<p>Secondly, with a unified sales organization, the malpractices of exploitation and manipulation by middlemen, as well as unpaid debts, can be completely eliminated. The most helpless situation for small bookstores in Shanghai is that they have to entrust the sales in various places to general booksellers. Because of the exploitation of these booksellers, Shanghai publishers have to set high prices for their books, but their income is still only 70% or 80% of the price, and even recovering the capital is not easy. However, readers who buy books must pay the full price or even add postage. Therefore, the existence of middlemen is detrimental to publishers and only increases the suffering of readers due to high prices. It is indeed an obstacle to the future development of culture. If there is a unified sales organization with a head office in Shanghai and branch offices in various places, these middlemen will not only have no chance to profit, but also the malpractice of unpaid debts like today can be completely eliminated. Because today's booksellers often take advantage of the independent operations of small bookstores and simply ignore the payments to Bookstore A. Bookstore A, because it is far away in another city, is inconvenient to collect the debt and has to suffer the loss, deciding not to wholesale books to them anymore. Bookstore A believes that this will put the bookseller in dire straits, but the reality is not so. They can still get books from Bookstore A through their dealings with Bookstore B. Therefore, unless bookstores A, B, C, and D can unite, booksellers who owe money in other cities can still find ways to wholesale books from various bookstores. There are really many such things, which is what small bookstores feel most painful about. If a unified sales organization can be established, booksellers in other cities who want to wholesale publications from bookstores A, B, C, and D must go through this organization, then they will have no way to use their cunning skills. Moreover, with the existence of branch organizations in various places, they can directly collect debts, and they will have no room to arbitrarily delay payments. This is the operational convenience that a unified sales organization gives to publishers, the second benefit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with a unified general sales organization in Shanghai and branch organizations in the interior, books can be immediately distributed to the whole country after publication to reach readers, unlike today, where publishers struggle to find readers, and readers, although seeing advertisements, struggle to find bookstores to buy books, or suffer losses from being deceived by advertisements after painstakingly remitting money and buying books with poor content. This phenomenon of separation between the publishing industry and the reading community can be connected with a unified sales organization, and it can also avoid the oppression of large publishers. The advantage of large publishers is that they have strong capital, so they can set up branches everywhere, while small publishers cannot. Now, if there is a unified sales organization, small publishers will have the same benefits as large publishers and will not have to worry about the monopoly oppression of large publishers. This is the third benefit.</p>
<p>Also, if the sales organization is separated from the publishing organization and operated independently, publishers can focus on publishing without having to worry about sales. In terms of organization, all that is needed is an editorial department to handle everything properly. (Printing, etc., can be handled by specialized printing organizations.) In this way, not only can capital be concentrated, which is economically beneficial, but also the concentration of manpower can achieve specialized results in operation. This division of labor between production and distribution is the most advanced point of modern capitalist production. Since the publishing industry is a modern industry, it must adopt advanced methods, otherwise, it will inevitably lag behind and be eliminated. This is the fourth benefit.</p>
<p>As for how to successfully establish this unified sales organization, I believe that it must first have huge capital, at least three to four hundred thousand, to establish sales organizations all over the country. Otherwise, the sales network will not be widespread, which will greatly affect the promotion of books. Secondly, the organization of this organization must be a third party unrelated to the publishing industry to maintain a neutral position, but at the same time, it also needs the participation of publishers to maintain contact and ensure that publishers participating in the organization immediately abandon their sales operations.</p>
<p>I believe that the publishing industry is the most promising among all industries in our country. With the popularization of education and the progress of culture, the number of literate people will inevitably increase, and the business market will only continue to expand. Moreover, because the publishing industry is a cultural undertaking, it enjoys special benefits such as postage and tariffs compared to other commercial businesses. This is a convenience that no other business has. Furthermore, almost no industry in our country today can escape the oppression of imperialists. Industries such as tobacco, cotton yarn, and flour are all in a difficult situation due to the dumping of foreign goods and the competition of foreign factories. Only the publishing industry does not have this phenomenon. In China, it is simply a monopoly world. Therefore, if it can be managed properly, there is much room for development. The current economic downturn is only a temporary phenomenon. If we can strive for reform, there is definitely a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Impressions of Various Bookstores (Continued) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>19. The Masses Bookstore</p>
<p>This bookstore has a relatively long history and is quite tenacious. Although it is in its twilight years, it is not afraid of long journeys and is running alongside others.</p>
<p>Those who pay attention to the book industry will think of "running after others" when mentioning the Masses Bookstore. In the early days, some of the Masses' "anti-imperialist" books did indeed gain considerable profits, but most of them were pieced together and could not withstand the competition of later emerging publishers. Soon, with the development of new literature, the Masses also published many literary books, and these literary books were not far from the "worship of ×," and now there is no foothold. Later, there came some compilations such as "×× Selections," which can be said to be more meaningful among the publications of the Masses.</p>
<p>The Masses' storefront is only this small half-room between the Modern Era (formerly New Moon) and others. Because it is sandwiched between the beautiful storefronts of other stores, the Masses' storefront looks even smaller. However, the Masses' storefront does not lose its customers because of its small size, but most of its customers are not its own. Previously, because the storefront of "Dawn" was attached to the Masses, it brought a lot of immediate sales to the Masses. Later, because the Shanghai Magazine Company was established in the Masses, it even reached the point of "bustling with activity." However, since "Dawn" and "Shanghai" established their own storefronts one after another, the Masses' business was naturally hit. However, the Masses has always been confident in "running after others." It then changed to a "magazine company" itself and also published several pictorials and other periodicals. However, following others is mostly "lagging behind." Moreover, the publications it publishes, whether in content or form, are equally poor. If there is anything noteworthy about the Masses, it is only the previous "Sound of the Tide" and the current "Mangzhong."</p>
<p>20. The Guangyi Bookstore</p>
<p>The Guangyi Bookstore mainly sells old books, but it has also published a few new books. It is said that Guangyi's business in old books (ancient books) is very considerable every year. The nature of the old books it publishes will not be discussed today, but in terms of new books, it is indeed too speculative. Looking at the things it publishes, such as "××× Methods," the form is indeed very fashionable, but the content itself still needs to study the "methods" to a large extent. Originally, it is impossible to produce anything other than crude and shoddy articles with a manuscript fee of one yuan or a few cents per thousand words.</p>
<p>The Guangyi's new book publication seems to be decreasing now (or even non-existent). We cannot say that this is not a "good" strategy for Guangyi.</p>
<p>21. Guangming, Lehua, and Wenyi</p>
<p>This joint storefront on Fourth Avenue has attracted the attention of readers before, because when the books of various bookstores were still sold at the actual price, the three storefronts marked out the "woodblock print 30% off, foreign edition 20% off" long-term discount method. Naturally, many readers ran to their place. However, soon, each store with a storefront on Fourth Avenue, due to the impact on business, stopped issuing books one after another. At the same time, "new books at half price" also became a common trend.</p>
<p>These three bookstores can be said to be the typical "family bookstores." They do it on a small scale, and there is little division of labor in editing and business. They watch the opportunity, and when they see an opportunity, they publish one or two books that adapt to the opportunity. Sometimes, they hit the bullseye, such as the League of Nations Investigation Team Report and Mussolini's Autobiography. The business is not bad. However, ultimately, they cannot be said to be publishers, but rather sellers. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e165">Various Methods of a Writer's Swindling <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Zushun</p>
<p>Zhang Kebiao once wrote The Art of Literary Advancement, revealing the secrets of fame, but Mr. Zhang finally failed to the point of seeking a job through classified ads, which shows that everyone can do tricks, but each has different skills. If you don't use it properly, you still can't succeed. Now I will introduce a few small tricks that are easier to play than the big ones.</p>
<p>1. Kill Two Birds with One Stone A writer who has not yet become famous has worked hard to write or translate a book and of course wants to sell it to a bookstore for publication. However, 99% of the time, you will not find a buyer, so you have to apply this method: please have a famous person lead the way, put your name behind his, and this way, he will find a place to publish for you. If it succeeds, you can give him half of the manuscript fee. And of course you shouldn't feel distressed, thinking that you only get half of the reward, because without him, you will never! never get even this half.</p>
<p>2. Kick Away the Ladder If you read a book and there are chapters quoted from some famous rare books, you should keep them in mind and find a way to quote them whenever you have the opportunity, but never state that you are quoting from that book, because that would be too uneconomical. You have to just note the name of the original book, and the chapter and page numbers must be stated clearly. If that book is in Italian, Latin, or Indian, be sure to copy the original text word for word, whether you understand it or not. This method not only shows that you are knowledgeable and talented, but also makes readers respect you as an honest writer.</p>
<p>Translating works from English or Japanese to Russian or Italian without noting the translation can also be considered a type of this method.</p>
<p>3. Avoid the Important and Dwell on the Trivial This third type of swindling is similar to the second type, but it is limited to foreign languages. Many famous works cannot be read because they are too long or because the original is not easy to find. Fortunately, there are many magazines abroad that specialize in doing summaries and detailed reviews and introductions. If you subscribe to a few copies every month, it is like reading the original text. When you are happy, you can translate a few paragraphs, just don't state whether it is translated or written by yourself, or vaguely note the words "excerpted translation" so that people don't understand whether you are excerpting from the original text or from the excerpt. The beauty of this method is that you can gradually build an image of erudition in the hearts of pure readers, and mischievous people cannot find your handle.</p>
<p>4. Grafting One Branch to Another When you see someone else's article with detailed citations and novel philosophy, and you are moved by it, you can apply this method. You can write an article close to this topic and quote all the citations and textual research one by one. This way, you can also list fifty or sixty notes and reference books at the end of your work. Who can not admire your extensive knowledge, and who can know that you only read a short article? Moreover, this method is absolutely not dangerous. Even if it is discovered, they can only sneer for a while and can never convict you of plagiarism.</p>
<p>5. Turning Guest into Host Dr. Hu Shih said that he can only get three or four hundred words per hour for translation work, which shows that this work is really not easy to do. It is really a thankless job. On the one hand, no matter how well you do it, there is always room for people to criticize. On the other hand, after spending so much effort, you only acted as an introducer. People always say that Wells' The Outline of History is good, but they won't say that the world history outline translated by so-and-so is really good. In this way, hard and difficult things, sometimes encountering a word or sentence that you have no way to deal with, you have to shake your head and think about it when eating and walking, but in the end you get a few yuan per thousand words and there is no follow-up, how pitiful. But it is really not easy to write a book by yourself, so it is better to change the translation to compilation, find a few books and piece them together, extracting a section here and half a chapter there. If you can't translate it, just don't, isn't that refreshing? If you are timid, you can note this sentence in the preface or postscript: "This book is mostly based on the ×× book by ××," and there is no danger at all. Recently, a gentleman translated a Japanese-published engineering manual, and even the printing errors are exactly the same, but in the preface, he said that this type of book is the first one compiled by Chinese people. His courage really makes us admire him.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many ways to swindle, but as long as the people who apply the above methods are black-hearted and thick-skinned, there is absolutely no danger. If readers cannot understand, I can still provide various examples for you to refer to.</p>
<h3 id="e166">All-Metal Vacuum Tube <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Xingshi</p>
<p>Although there are many styles of vacuum tubes on the market now, their shells are all made of glass. Anyone who has played with radios knows that in many devices, a metal shielding cover must be added to the outside of the vacuum tube to obtain excellent performance. This not only costs money, but also increases the size of the radio a lot. But now, that's good. The United States has invented an all-metal vacuum tube. This invention is bound to open up a new path for future vacuum tube manufacturing.</p>
<p>This vacuum tube is made entirely of metal except for the glass beads used for insulation where the lead wires come out. Its volume is much smaller than the current glass-shelled tubes, and it is undoubtedly more sturdy. Because metal shells are easy to manufacture, the cost can also be reduced. This type of vacuum tube is easy to dissipate heat and has excellent shielding performance. It will soon be able to replace the position of today's vacuum tube.</p>
<p>The metal shell of this new tube is cylindrical, with a slightly smaller diameter at the top. The grid of the high-frequency tube is also at the top. The wires drawn from each electrode first pass through a small glass ball and are heated and melted. Small holes are drilled in the metal shell where the lead wires pass through. A new alloy (a combination of iron, nickel, and cobalt) called Fernico is placed around the holes. Its coefficient of expansion is exactly the same as glass. This is very important and can be said to be a major reason for the success of this vacuum tube. The glass beads are placed at the openings of the holes and melted together. Because of that alloy, the glass beads and the metal shell can be firmly bonded together and will not break due to heat.</p>
<p>The lead wires inside the vacuum tube are short and straight, so they are more suitable for short waves. Its volume is also reduced as a result. Moreover, because of the convenience of manufacturing the metal shell, it can be very close to the internal electrodes, greatly reducing the internal screen-grid capacitance to about one-third of that of the current vacuum tube, so the amplification factor of the vacuum tube can be increased without causing instability.</p>
<p>The metal shell itself is connected to the ground wire, so the trouble of adding a shielding cover can be completely avoided. The number of pins on the vacuum tube is also one more than similar tubes because the metal shell is grounded.</p>
<p>There are now ten types of this all-metal vacuum tube, six of which are being mass-produced by the Alsea Company. One is a double-diode twin-tube, with the cathodes of the two diodes separated and isolated in the middle, but its height is only eight-fifths of an inch, which is much smaller than the current vacuum tube.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Automatic Noise Suppression <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Mingxiang</p>
<p>Generally, the more vacuum tubes a radio has and the higher its sensitivity, the stronger the radio's noise will be. The source of this noise is sometimes not due to disturbances from atmospheric static electricity and man-made static electricity, nor is it caused by damaged parts inside the radio. For example, the impact and movement of electrons on the wires, as well as the emission of electrons in the vacuum tube, are the main causes of this unavoidable noise. When the radio is turned on, before the music has been tuned in, hissing noise fills the ears, which is really unpleasant. Fortunately, the advancement of radio technology is constantly making satisfactory solutions to difficult problems. The automatic noise suppression described in this article is also one of the latest successes.</p>
<p>The main component that completes the automatic noise suppression function is still the vacuum tube, the heart of the radio. The basic principle is to use the rectification effect of the detector tube to generate a control voltage that is supplied to another specially designed control vacuum tube. The effect of this control tube is to completely stop the audio frequency amplification section of the radio from working when it has not been tuned to the signal voltage input. If an external signal carrier arrives, the control tube immediately and automatically restores the audio frequency stage to its original task and broadcasts beautiful programs. Therefore, automatic noise suppression devices and automatic volume control are essential conditions for high-end radios. This control tube is usually specifically referred to as the Noise Suppression Control Tube, and some are simply called Q tubes.</p>
<p>The diagram shows the simplest automatic noise suppression circuit. V1 is a diode used as a detector using the rectification principle; V2 is a triode used for automatic noise suppression; V3 is the controlled audio frequency amplifier tube.</p>
<p>When the input transformer is not receiving an external signal, V1 has no screen current flowing, that is, no negative voltage is supplied to the V2 grid, so the screen current passing through R2 is the largest. This extremely large screen current causes V3 to generate an extremely high negative voltage to supply to the V3 grid, sufficient to cut off the V1 screen current and completely lose its amplification effect. At this time, the audio frequency stage of the radio has been suppressed and cannot work. If a signal is input, V2 generates a screen current. At both ends of R, there are DC and audio frequency voltages. This DC voltage can be supplied to V2 to increase its grid negative potential, causing the screen current to cut off. There is no voltage drop on R2. At this time, the audio frequency signal voltage on R is fed to the V3 grid through C4. Because the V3 grid negative voltage is extremely low, it can already fulfill its amplification duties.</p>
<p>The working principles of automatic noise suppression and automatic volume control are the same, that is, changing the grid voltage of the amplifier tube. However, the difference is that the former belongs to the audio frequency stage, and the latter belongs to the high-frequency or intermediate frequency stage.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Methods for Preventing Howling in Low-Frequency Amplification <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Weng Yanhuo</p>
<p>Howling in low-frequency amplification is caused by low-frequency oscillation generated from the amplifier. Because the iron core coil of the transformer contains a considerable amount of distributed capacitance and self-inductance, it forms an oscillation circuit, which is oscillated by the magnetic-electric effect of the wiring and the static-electric effect. Although the initial sound of the oscillation is very small, it becomes an ear-piercing howl after amplification. Here is a brief description of the prevention methods:</p>
<p>(1) The grid circuit should be firmly connected, short, and the shorter the better.</p>
<p>(2) It is not easy to oscillate when using resistance amplification.</p>
<p>(3) The position must be arranged properly.</p>
<p>(4) If transformer amplification is used, the transformers should be separated so that the iron cores are at right angles to each other. Even better, isolate them with a metal cover.</p>
<p>(5) A fixed capacitor of 0.001-0.002 microfarads can be installed between the grid circuit and the filament of the second-stage amplification.</p>
<p>(6) Any wiring should be short.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Method for Self-Made Carbon Resistor Ohm Disc Identification <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhui</p>
<p>Currently, there is a rotating disc on the market for identifying the ohm value of carbon resistors, priced at about forty or fifty cents. However, it seems to be a shoddy product, so the author went home and made one himself based on its appearance. It is very convenient and accurate to use, and the manufacturing method is very simple. Why not make one yourself for emergencies and to prevent money from flowing out? Now, the detailed manufacturing process is listed below:</p>
<p>Materials: One square piece of cardboard (or thicker white paper)</p>
<p>Seven colors of paint (or colored paper cutouts can also be used)</p>
<p>A small amount of No. 24 enameled wire</p>
<p>First, cut the cardboard as shown in Figure 1, fold it along the dotted line, and cut three fan-shaped holes as shown in the figure. Then, cut three circular cardboard pieces, A, B, and C, as shown in Figure 2. Divide them into several grids as shown in the figure, and mark the ohm numbers. Dye them in various colors. Everything is clearly marked in the figures, so there is no need to repeat it.</p>
<p>Finally, use enameled wire to fix it as shown in the figure so that it can rotate. Thus, a simple and practical resistor identification disc is completed, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>For example, if there is a resistor with a brown body, a black head, and an orange center, we rotate the grid above the "body" character to brown, the grid on the "head" character to black, and the grid on the "center" character to orange. As shown in the figure, we can know that this resistor is 10,000 ohms.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Homemade Soldering Flux <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— He Feng</p>
<p>When wiring a radio receiver, soldering is unavoidable. There are usually two types of soldering: one using rosin and the other using zinc chloride (commonly known as muriatic acid). It is easy to work with zinc chloride, but it requires more skill to use rosin. However, many amateurs agree that using zinc chloride for soldering has more disadvantages than advantages, because when the zinc chloride is heated by the soldering iron, it explodes with a bang, scattering powder in all directions, easily corroding the equipment. If it is not cleaned thoroughly, it will turn green over time due to chemical changes, and even gradually corrode the soldered area, hindering the radio's operation. There is no such drawback with rosin soldering. However, rosin is more difficult to use. Now, based on amateur experience, the rosin is crushed into powder, placed in "Vaseline" (available at pharmacies), and mixed evenly. Steam it slightly over water for a moment, and then use it. It is very convenient, and its performance is no different from all the soldering fluxes sold on the market. If you have time, you might as well try it.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Finance: Major Players' Buying Interest Strong, Bullion Price Rises to $839 <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Market Unsettled, Extremely Fluctuating: From Tight to Weak, Still Up $11.2</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was fueled by a resurgence of bullish activity from major players, facing a fierce surge in prices. The market sentiment was inherently volatile, easily swayed and prone to reaction. Dealers lacked a clear target. Although the market was brisk for the day, the trend was uncertain. In the morning, the market opened with the Shanghai silver market, with British currency up and American currency flat. The "big feet" (major speculators) said that the United States would buy in at 0.0625 below the closing price after the market closed. The forward silver price in Montreux contracted by one percent and rose by half a percent. Exchange rates were all up, and the price of gold in London rose by one and a half pence. Market sentiment recovered, and the over-the-counter pre-market trading opened above the $20 mark, with strong buying interest, rising to $25 or $26 before falling back to $24 or $25. The Central Bank's posted prices were revealed, with British currency flat and American currency up. The Customs Gold Unit rose by one percent, and the posted standard price for bullion rose to $859.9. Market sentiment remained good. The morning opening was high, and the market was slightly calmer after opening. However, market sentiment was extraordinarily bullish, with frequent buying interest. Midway, the Central Bank and other banks were still selling a lot, but with buyers gathering in large numbers, major players took the opportunity to increase their bids again, pushing the price up again. Sellers were able to become active, and the HSBC posted price did not move, gradually falling back, once turning weak. Unexpectedly, later, Reuters repeatedly telegraphed that the Hong Kong market was buoyant, stimulating market sentiment in this area. The foreign exchange market also became extremely tight, and the price surge intensified, rising to $835.5. The Central Bank and other banks continued to sell while prices were high, and buying interest calmed down slightly. Sellers then rose up, and the Hong Kong market briefly rebounded, falling back to within $30. However, the Hong Kong market soon softened again, and at noon, it remained firm. The overall trend hovered. In the afternoon, the market turned firm and buoyant, with major players jointly buying heavily, and banks also bidding, once approaching the $40 mark. Taking advantage of high prices, supply became more active, and the price surge was blocked. Sellers became active, and the price immediately fell. The first telegraph from India reported an increase of four annas, transforming the downstream market, but it still turned around. However, because Yicheng repeatedly sold, the upward trend was difficult to sustain. The Central Bank sold shillings first, and the Jewish merchant Joe Chih-fu sold American currency directly, triggering a selling wave and falling back to within $30. The second report from India was a two-anna increase. At this time, it was still trading, but market sentiment had softened, and sellers were easily able to assert their dominance. Major players also re-emerged and continued to fall, finally returning to flat. The overall trend for the day was firm and then weak. The Hong Kong market was tight and loose, causing frequent ups and downs. Both buyers and sellers lacked confidence. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $825.5, an increase of $9 from the previous close. Yongli Heng Yu Chunyuan Yong sold contracts, falling back to $4.1. Fuxing Yongheng Yuanyiyingxiang Chunyuan Yong Yuyuqing Yonglai entered, immediately rising to $9. The Central Bank came out selling current shillings at 3125, Chunyuan Yongheng Yuanymao Yong sold, falling back to $6.3. Fuxing Yongheng Yu Futa Yong Huixiang Dacheng Houchang Yongfu Yu all entered, immediately breaking through the $30 mark, rising to $31.

The Central Bank's posted prices were announced, with the British pound flat and the US dollar up 0.0625, and the customs gold rose by one percent. However, the psychological state of Chinese merchants was quite good, and it was tight immediately after the opening. The Central Bank sold spot shillings, and banks were quite willing to trade against it. Anticipating that the HSBC posted price would be flat for both British and American currencies, although it was tight, there were many trades. Later, the Hong Kong market softened, stimulating buying interest, and it became tight again. Banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices. After entering, the Hong Kong market briefly hardened, and the process was also loose. However, the Hong Kong market soon softened again, and the sentiment in this area was good again. Therefore, the situation at noon was slightly uncertain. In the afternoon, the market trended tight, and banks also had a buying appetite. Until the Indian silver reported increases of four, three, and two annas, the process began to loosen. Although Sassoon was buying, the Central Bank also came to sell, and the Jewish merchant Joe Chih-fu let go of selling US dollars. After this, it gradually hardened, and the Hong Kong market also loosened accordingly, so Chinese merchants slightly sold. However, due to the banks' maintenance at cheap prices, it was able to support it. At the close, the selling price for the near term was one shilling and seven pence 1875 and 25 pairs, and the US dollar was $39.5, which, compared with the previous close, was a tight of 0.15625 for the British pound and a tight of 0.375 for the US dollar. There were major players in the Chinese merchant community who bought up, totaling about 200,000 pounds in near-term shillings and more than 500,000 US dollars.

<h3 id="e174">Securities: Bond Market Slightly Up Amid Fluctuations <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Stock Exchange fluctuated under the influence of the environment. Initially, with the resolution of the incident, the concerns of the public were relieved. Various groups rushed to buy and cover their positions, and with the launch of August futures, the demand from retail investors was extremely high. As a result, the market felt a sudden demand exceeding supply, and a price surge occurred, with all bonds rising sharply. The momentum was said to be strong. Subsequently, the disruption of traffic in Tianjin and Peiping caused the market to become weak, and large investors started selling, causing the market prices to fall uniformly. Later, due to the support of the financial sector, the market rose again. However, at the end of the closing session, it became sluggish again. Looking at the overall market process, the market price fluctuated, indicating that the public was extremely uncertain and the environment was changeable. With the new customs treasury bills of 10,000 being approved for issuance, burdened by many restraints, it is feared that the market price will not be allowed to rise linearly. The current market trend may fall slightly, but from tomorrow, due to the weekly holiday and the end of the half-year, there will be three days of closure, which will inevitably cause a surge in covering short positions. Looking back on yesterday's events, there was a sharp increase of six to seven cents in the morning due to the needs of general retail investors. In the second session, due to the disruption of traffic in Tianjin and Peiping, sellers rose up and returned three to five cents. In the two sessions of the afternoon market, 33.1 and 21 batches were absorbed and gradually increased. According to the total daily market price results, the overall increase ranged from two to three cents to seven to eight cents, with a total transaction volume of 25,231,000 yuan. The high and low results are listed in the comparison table on the left, with the unit being yuan and the transaction unit being one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Panama Bonds Still Paid in Gold</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Bank reported that yesterday's (27th) New York stock market was chaotic after the Chicago Northwestern Railroad announced its application to the regulatory authorities to reorganize under bankruptcy law. It rebounded slightly before the close, with silver, automobile, and liquor stocks rebounding the most. Stocks on the small exchange were mixed and sluggish, and the bond market also fell. Railroad bonds were very weak. The price of Panama public bonds rose sharply because the Panamanian government decided to pay the expenses of the canal in gold rather than devalued yuan. The total volume of transactions was 740,000 shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Yarn Flowers　Yarn Flower Popularity Slightly Excited <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>—One Day Yarn Exchange Holiday—</p>
<p>The yarn market showed a slight firmness, due to reports that the negotiations had concluded, and at the same time, the bid prices were rising, and people's hearts showed slight excitement. However, the current yarn business has not been able to develop, and selling prices are relatively loose, because finance is still tight, and the selling prices of foreign yarn are also cheap, so Chinese yarn is naturally constrained.</p>
<p>All floating households are bidding high for yarn. At the opening of the previous market, each month tended to rise. Due to the resolution of the situation in Zhangbei, the bid prices rebounded, and people's hearts were once excited, with many bulls active. However, foreign yarn still fell, and the market sentiment was affected by it. Generally, floating households are bullish due to the depletion of the underlying market. However, the environment is unfavorable, and most prices are sluggish. Foreign firms are safely inactive, observing the previous movements and considering actual sales as the turning point. As a result, each month rose by 5, 6, 7, 9 cents to 1 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market sentiment was still firm at the opening in the afternoon, but it fell back after two or three rounds of bidding. It is heard that the current yarn trend is not smooth, and the market slightly rebounded. As a result, each month was the same as the closing price in the morning. It was found that Yida sold 1,150 bales, Yuda 250 bales, Dafeng 450 bales, Guangfeng 450 bales, Dachangcheng 300 bales, Yichang 900 bales, Hexing 300 bales, and Taichang 400 bales. Jinchang bought 1,400 bales, Yuan Yi 800 bales, Changfeng 250 bales, Run Kang 350 bales, Xiecheng 550 bales, Junchang 500 bales, Yongda 600 bales, and Shenji 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Actual sales are difficult to develop, and the sales of current yarn are mediocre. Statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 784 bales in the previous two days. The market conditions are similar to the above. The purchase amounts of each gang are listed below:</p>
<p>Henan 250 Xuzhou 20 Guangdong 140</p>
<p>Changsha 10 Inland 30 Fujian 14</p>
<p>Sichuan 100 Yunnan 60</p>
<p>Notice of Yarn Exchange Holiday: The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange will be closed on July 1st for the bank's annual closing of accounts. The market will stop gathering and take a temporary holiday for one day. It has already been announced.</p>
<p>The cotton market followed the yarn market and rose, but the situation was relatively loose. The weather has been favorable recently, and the new cotton production in the north is good and the growth is healthy. As for old cotton bulls, although there are rumors of short squeezes, the yarn mills' demand is expected to decrease, and there is still a risk of surplus old cotton. Large quantities are in the hands of the banking industry.</p>
<p>Although Zheng Biao rose only slightly, the flower bid market opened higher in the previous market. Each month rose uniformly. American cotton rose slightly by 5 points, while Indian cotton showed mixed ups and downs. The situation in the market was not very tense, because the weather has been favorable recently, which is good for the growth of new cotton. As a result, each month rose by 1.5 to 2 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, old cotton sales were sluggish due to the yarn mills stopping work, and it fell back by a small amount of 1 cent compared to the morning closing price, while the far month was flat. It was found that Suilong sold 1,000 dan, Dafu 4,900 dan, Yichang 5,400 dan, Yikang 2,200 dan, Changji 2,600 dan, Yicheng 1,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,100 dan, and Changhe 1,000 dan. Meiji bought 6,100 dan, Yuan Yi 1,200 dan, Changfeng 3,400 dan, Shengyuan 3,300 dan, Xincheng 2,000 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,300 dan, and Yuda 1,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>The cotton demand of each factory has stalled, and the current cotton market is even more stagnant. Each factory's intake is not smooth, because the yarn market is sluggish and costs are losing money every day. Therefore, demand is shrinking. The source is estimated to be 300 bales of Yao flower.</p>
<p>American Cotton Closes Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with calm conditions. Each month showed ups and downs of 1 point. New Orleans bought in, and the Far East covered shorts. There was no special news in the market. There were forecasts of rain in Texas and the eastern cotton areas. The transaction volume was still not large. Industry insiders are waiting for development. Current demand is sluggish, and the textile market is quiet. The market closed firm, with spot prices rising by 5 points and futures prices rising by 5 to 9 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 7 points, and futures prices rose by 5 or 6 points. Indian cotton was weak due to speculative selling and a lack of buyers. Pingguoer showed ups and downs of 0.25 to 1 rupee, Aomula 0.25 rupee, and Bailuoxi rose by half a rupee. Original telegram left. (27th electric)</p>
<p>According to a report from Bombay, the opening forecast for the April-May period of Bailuoxi flower on the 27th was 212 rupees, up half a rupee from the previous closing price.</p>

<p>The Futures Flour and Wheat Market Suddenly Surges</p>
<p>The flour market yesterday showed a good and sharp trend again. The quoted price of foreign wheat was 8.08 cents. Although the market sentiment was initially calm, the opening price for this month was 7 cents, and then the market immediately jumped up 1.75 cents. The opening price for the forward period was because foreign exchange was shrinking frequently, gold prices were expensive, and early Meiyu season in various places would cause floods, resulting in abnormal buying sentiment inside and outside the industry, which was 1 cent better than the previous day. Later, the manufacturers sold a little, and the market sentiment was slightly calmer. Until the afternoon opening, the market was quite flat and soft at first. Because this month is the last half day, outsiders have to cover the shorts, and the situation is quite tight. Fortunately, the manufacturers hedged, so they were able to pass safely. The sentiment of the forward period market was still good and was still covertly bullish. As a result, this month rose by 2 cents compared to the previous day, July rose by half a cent, August rose by 1 cent, September rose by 7.5 cents, October rose by 1.5 cents, and November rose by 1.75 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened well in the morning. Because the price of gold soared, the selling of foreign wheat was naturally affected. Furthermore, due to the impending floods in various places, the sentiment inside and outside the industry suddenly turned bullish again. Therefore, although the trading was not very smooth, the price rose by 3 to 4 cents. During the various sessions in the afternoon, the trading was still not very active, and the market had already stabilized. Because after this month, spot goods can actually be hedged, this situation is bound to be related to the actual easing of credit. As a result, July was better by 4 cents, August was better by 5 cents, October was better by 4 cents, and there were no comparisons for the rest. The situation of current wheat was that sales were both smooth and popular. High-quality goods were slightly popular, while medium and inferior goods were still flat. The opening prices were 3.46 yuan for Bazhang Ridge wheat, 3.45 yuan for Shiying wheat, 3.40 yuan for Jiangxinzhou wheat, 3.36-3.37 yuan for Danyang wheat, 3.34 yuan for Gaoyou and Hezhou wheat, 3.37 yuan for Puzhen wheat, 3.43-3.44 yuan for Kunshan wheat, 3.42 yuan for Dangshi wheat, 3.40 yuan for Penglai wheat, 3.38 yuan for second-grade, 3.35-3.37 yuan for Taicang wheat, 3.44 yuan for Weiting wheat, 3.40 yuan for Anting wheat, 3.39 yuan for second-grade, 3.37-3.39 yuan for Zhitang wheat, and 3.34 yuan for Chongming wheat. Fuxin went to 5,000 bags, Fufeng went to 3,000 bags, Shenda went to 1,200 bags, and Xinda went to 500 bags.</p>

<p>—Imported Rice Sales Still Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday's domestic rice (Hu Nan) had even fewer sources from the guest gangs than before, with only the 13th and 14th batches arriving (a total of 2,600-2,700 stones). However, the market situation ultimately suffered from a decline in morale, so the sales market continued to weaken, and the intake was only more than 300 packages. The market was quiet, and the market color fell again. The opening prices of the various thick varieties fell another 1-2 jiao, while the thin varieties fell by less than a jiao. As for the "Chuyin Bianyuan" brand, the price plummeted 3-4 jiao due to untimely application. (Hu Bei) Yesterday, 16-17 ships from He Xia arrived. Although the market tried to persuade the guest gangs to take the goods, the owners were still hoping for better prices, so retail sales remained weak. The market price of white japonica rice fell slightly, while the price of early thin rice had no significant ups and downs. The price of white yuan rice also fell by about 1 jiao, and the prices of other varieties also showed a downward trend.</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market was even flatter and softer. Because the river channels have been clear for several days, rice from various He Xia routes has been arriving in Shanghai continuously, and the selling price has gradually decreased. The sales of imported rice have been reduced significantly, and the market has gradually become softer. Yesterday, the intake of the mainland gangs was still stagnant, and the entertainment in this street was limited, while the Yangtze River gangs stopped completely, making the market even weaker. More mid-grade and inferior rice arrived, and the price fell another 5-6 fen. After the price drop, local businesses in this street took the opportunity to buy small quantities, but there were not many transactions, and the bidding price remained tight, making it difficult for the market to recover. 6,500 bags of Saigon rice, 1,000 bags of small jia rice, and more than 1,000 bags of Su Gengdi Siamese rice and 320 bags of Wenzhou machine rice were opened for sale throughout the day.</p>

<p>Due to the current mold season, the sales of raw peanuts are very rare. In order to avoid the trouble of frequent drying, the number of ordinary goods in the warehouses sold at slightly lower prices yesterday, including 6 yuan for Kaifeng peanuts and 5.5 yuan for Shandong peanuts, totaling more than 40 tons, which were purchased by Guangdu.</p>

<p>"People rarely know the faults of their own children, and rarely know the vigor of their own seedlings." These are the words of Confucius. Zhu Xi added two annotations to it: "Those who are indulgent are not clear, and those who are greedy are insatiable." Later generations extended its meaning and evolved it into two common sayings: "A son is always one's own good, and a woman is always someone else's good." Although the examples are different, the meaning is the same. I think it is not entirely true; beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and everyone who has a love history will admit this, right? Isn't this "a woman is always one's own good"? Seeing other people's children become successful, promoted and wealthy, who doesn't envy them and hate their own children for not living up to expectations? Isn't this "a son is always someone else's good"? Looking at these two examples, not only is the common saying upside down, but even the words of Confucius are a bit "mixed up". Zhu Jia's words are more glib.</p>

<p>—Cat Hermit Master</p>
<p>Among Kunqu operas, there is a play called "Fifteen Strings of Cash," which describes the story of Prefect Kuang reversing a wrongful conviction. There is also "The Legend of Fifteen Strings of Cash," which was written by Zhu Suchen of Wu County in the Qing Dynasty, and is similar to the Kunqu opera. Prefect Kuang was an honest and upright official, and was known as "Kuang Qingtian" (meaning Kuang, the clear sky). Since he was a famous official of the Ming Dynasty, the story of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" should have originated in the Ming Dynasty. However, things are not always the case. The actual story of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" originated in the Song Dynasty in Nanjing. Recently, I read a passage in Qu Yuan's "Random Notes from the Chunzai Hall":</p>
<p>In Lin'an, Southern Song Dynasty, there was a man named Liu Gui, courtesy name Junjian, who had a wife named Wang and a concubine named Chen. One day, he took his wife to celebrate the birthday of his father-in-law. His father-in-law, Wang Weng, gave him fifteen strings of cash because he was poor, so that he could earn a living. He kept his daughter but let his son-in-law return first. On the way, he met his friend, drank with him, and got drunk. When he returned home, his concubine saw the money he was carrying and asked why. Liu Gui, drunk, teased her and said: Because my family is poor and cannot live together, I have rented you to someone. This is the rental money. I will send you there tomorrow. After speaking, he went to bed and fell asleep. The concubine thought of telling her parents, so she went to the home of her neighbor, Zhu Sanlao, told him the reason, and stayed overnight. She left at dawn. Liu Gui was still fast asleep and had not woken up. A thief broke into his house, stole his money. Liu woke up in surprise, got up and chased him. He happened to find an ax on the ground. The thief took the ax and killed Liu, taking all the money. The next day, the neighbors saw that his door had not been opened for a long time, and when they went inside, they found the situation. Zhu Sanlao then said that his concubine had stayed overnight with him. So they searched together. The concubine, halfway on the road, rested because she was tired. A man named Cui Ning, who sold silk in the city, also earned fifteen strings of cash. He rested with her. The pursuers arrived and wanted to take them both back. When the officer heard, he said that Cui and the concubine had an affair, killed her husband, stole his money, and were fleeing together. They were publicly executed in the market. Later, his wife, because her husband died and her family was poor, her father, Wang Weng, sent someone to welcome her home. On the way, she encountered heavy rain and took refuge in a forest. She was captured by a robber and taken as his wife. She accidentally mentioned the events of several years ago, and the wife knew that the robber was the one who killed her husband. She took the opportunity to report to the Lin'an government, and the truth came to light.</p>
<p>According to this, the Kunqu opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is very similar, probably because later generations wanted to praise Kuang Qingtian for his honesty, so they developed this story.</p>

<p>About the second Tuesday last week? I was involved in a friend's case, and I started questioning. On the one hand, I wanted to attend the hearing; at the same time, I wanted to add some experience to me, this novice, so I drove straight to the Nanshi District Court. After arriving at the court, because it was still early, I waited in the court's waiting room for more than an hour.</p>
<p>The waiting room, what a terrible and sacred, solemn place it is? What's more, it's the waiting room of the court, which makes people feel a different kind of mood.</p>
<p>When I was waiting in the waiting room, there were already many people waiting to be tried, and many more were arriving one after another? If we take the gender of men and women to count, then men accounted for eight tenths, and women only accounted for two tenths.</p>
<p>I sat in the waiting room, carefully observing the people who were about to be tried. Some were frowning, as if a huge disaster was coming upon them; some were whispering, discussing how to deal with the judge's questions? Some were thinking silently, as if repenting of their mistakes. What especially aroused my infinite emotion was that the defendant and the plaintiff were in the same room. On the surface, they still shook hands and said hello when they met, but in reality, each person's mind was planning how to deal with you? Alas! This hypocritical and terrible society, here, gives people a profound hint!</p>
<p>In short, the court is solemn, and the waiting room is the most likely place to evoke feelings. There, I remembered what Mr. Zhu Bailu said, "Lawsuits always end in misfortune," which is really true.</p>

<p>—Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Recently, in the alley where I live, an old gentleman of sixty-three years old remarried a young girl of twenty-five years old. This event almost aroused the attention of everyone in the alley. So many busybodies were desperately probing all the news of this family as material for conversation.</p>
<p>This sixty-three-year-old gentleman was once the director of a tax office for a while, so he has considerable assets in his hands. Last year, his old partner died, and he felt lonely, so he married this high-achieving student from a certain girl's school through an introduction. This old gentleman's second wife is seventeen years younger than his eldest son. His youngest son is also four years older than this stepmother.</p>
<p>One day, at the banquet, this old gentleman, with six or seven points of drunkenness, announced his motive for marrying such a young wife: "You don't need to be surprised about my marriage. I am so old, living one day is like two and a half days. Naturally, I don't hope that someone will keep chastity for me after my death, so I married such an educated young woman. I live one day, she lives with me one day. When I kick my legs, I don't have to worry that she won't find a way out."</p>
<p>At the same time, his wife secretly said to her classmates: "In this way, I don't have to worry about not getting the inheritance. Isn't this stronger than demanding alimony through divorce? He is already sixty-three years old this year, and his body is not very healthy either. If I keep watch for a few years and get the inheritance, I don't have to worry about not being able to develop, right?"</p>
<p>The old husband has the old husband's worries, and the young wife has the young wife's ideas. Such a combination, I think, is more suitable.</p>

<p>As Zhiqian spoke, Hu Xiaojiao's face slowly changed color. Finally, she twitched her nose twice, sniffing and crying. She lifted a piece of her clothes and wiped her tears, saying; "What you, sir, said is not all the truth? I have been thinking about it for two days, and I can't come up with any ideas. That Miss Yang also said that what he said was reasonable everywhere, and I was moved by what he said, so I said I would try, but I didn't say that it would definitely work." Zhiqian said: "Don't cry yet, what did he say? Maybe what he said is right, you tell me." Hu Saozi wiped away her tears, and shook her head slightly, saying: "As soon as you, sir, revealed it, I no longer believed his words. He said: The concubine will always be liked by the master. As long as the girl marries over, and acts cute in front of the master, she doesn't have to worry about the master not supporting her mother-in-law. Even if the master takes him to the south, he can often write letters, and as long as he has money, he can also take his mother and grandmother there, and he can also come back to Xi'an to see them. Soon, the train will be connected to Xi'an, and the train is very convenient. That's what he said, it sounds very nice. But I thought, I'm afraid things are not so easy. Now that Master Cheng has said it, people's hearts are made of flesh, so how can he be willing to part with her? But that Miss Yang is also too good at talking, and as soon as she speaks, I get confused." Beihai, ever since she broke that teacup, has been feeling very embarrassed, and has not spoken for a long time. Yuan then interjected: "Although I can't speak as comprehensively as Cheng Guangsheng, I also feel that you don't have to wait to sell people to make a living. You go back and discuss it, you take another route." As he spoke, his face was not turned towards Hu Saozi, as if he felt a little uneasy in his heart. (252)</p>

<p>—Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Then how will this disease be diagnosed? Only the step of observing the complexion can be omitted, and the pulse can be taken directly. At that time, two small square tables had been set up on both sides of the Empress Dowager's throne, with a soft cushion spread on the table. After the four imperial physicians respectfully bowed their heads nine times, the Empress Dowager ordered two other female officials to roll up half of Yi Fu's sleeves, allowing her to sit upright on the throne in the middle, and put her arms on the small tables on both sides. Then the four imperial physicians knelt forward, all the way to the two small tables; at the same time, two female officials had already covered the Empress Dowager's arms with two very thin silk scarves, because how could such a noble person as the Empress Dowager be easily touched by irrelevant people! The four imperial physicians divided into two sides, two on each side, and carefully stretched out their hands, using their fingertips to take the Empress Dowager's pulse quietly through the silk scarf. As for taking the pulse, this method of diagnosing disease is really mysterious! They don't use a stopwatch to calculate the number of pulses, they only rely on five fingers to press, how can they know the patient's condition? I used to think it was miraculous—and I still don't understand it.</p>
<p>After a while, the imperial physicians on the left and right sides quietly switched places; but they never dared to peek at the Empress Dowager, although in fact they knew that there should be a procedure to look at the patient's tongue coating, or the Empress Dowager herself would not refuse, but they were always very cautious, how dare they rashly ask for the Empress Dowager's tongue? They also tried their best to avoid the Empress Dowager's gaze, and even when taking the pulse, they deliberately turned their heads a little, as if they were shy. (352)</p>

<h3 id="e185">Old Stories of the East Gate <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>—Shanghai General News Agency</p>
<p>In the past, when Shanghai still had a city wall, the side facing the Huangpu River was the East Gate. The Great East Gate was called Chaozong Gate, and it was located at the east end of today's Zhaojiabang Road; the Small East Gate was north of the Great East Gate, and it was called Baodai Gate, located at the east end of today's Fangbang Road. Walk past the front gate of the City God Temple and run east to reach it.</p>
<p>Shanghai has long been an international trading market, with foreign ships arriving in droves. At that time, of course, there were no current concession areas. The market was centered on the county seat, and merchant ships poured in from the Huangpu River, making the area outside the East Gate the focus of the dock. The Great East Gate and the Small East Gate were incredibly lively.</p>
<p>In the twenty-third year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the sea ban was abolished. The following year, Shanghai established a customs office, called "Jianghai Great Customs," which sat outside the northeast of the Small East Gate, facing the Huangpu River; cargo ships entering the port had to pass by it, which was a strategic location.</p>
<p>Outside of the current Min Guo Road, connecting Taikoo Road and Zhoushan Road, there is a "Foreign Firm Street." Speaking of the history of this street, it is very long. According to the Shanghai County Chronicle compiled in the nineteenth year of the Jiaqing reign, both the county map in Volume 1 and the lane descriptions in Volume 6 have recorded this street name; from this, it can be proved that Foreign Firm Street was by no means only after the five ports were opened for trade, and the prosperity of Shanghai's foreign firms before the opening of the port can be imagined. In the Jiaqing era, Foreign Firm Street ran north from outside the Small East Gate, directly to Customs Street: and there were two parallel streets, the inner Foreign Firm Street and the outer Foreign Firm Street. Now, only one street remains.</p>
<p>In the twenty-third year of the Daoguang reign, Shanghai was opened as a treaty port based on the Treaty of Nanjing, and successively there were British and French settlement areas designated in the north of the city, slightly robbing the southern city of its business. The Shanghai Daotai then built another customs office at the dam outside Beidou (established in the twenty-sixth year of the Daoguang reign), called the North Customs, also known as the New Customs, and the Great Customs of the Small East Gate thus became the South Customs or Old Customs.</p>
<p>When the French Concession was first designated, the southern end of the east side only reached the Xinkai River, and the nature of the Xinkai River was equivalent to a "boundary creek" (Defence Creek). In the ninth month of the eleventh year of the Xianfeng reign, the French Concession was expanded for the first time. They saw the importance of the area along the river, so they repeatedly exerted pressure and obtained the expansion of the southeast of their concession, extending a tongue below the Xinkai River, all the way to the Sixteenth Wharf. At that time, the Small East Gate faced the French Concession, and Foreign Firm Street also licked that extended tongue.</p>
<p>After the area north of the Sixteenth Wharf outside the city was划 into the French Concession, what happened to the Old Customs? It doesn't matter, the Old Customs had already moved to the Great East Gate, because after the Customs Office of the Small East Gate was destroyed by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army in the tenth year of the Xianfeng reign, it was changed to working in the Rescue Bureau of the Great East Gate.</p>
<p>On the tongue of the French Concession, many roads were later built, using Chinese place names to name them, such as Taiwan Road, Zhoushan Road, and Fujian Road, which is very interesting. These road names are repeated with the road names in the British Concession. The Taikoo Road mentioned earlier, also written as Dagu Road, has also become one of Shanghai's repeated road names.</p>
<p>As the road administration of the foreign concession was improved day by day and the market became more prosperous, the Shanghai authorities felt that they had to catch up quickly. In the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign, Shanghai County began to build a main road outside the beach of the Great East Gate, named Outer Bund; later, they built Inner Bund west of Outer Bund. As soon as the thoroughfare was built, the market naturally followed the Huangpu Bund of the British and French Concessions. Because the beach outside the Great East Gate extends into the river, the Outer Bund is not directly connected to the foreign concession, but the Inner Bund connects to the French Bund. Friends who don't often run to the East Gate, when looking for the so-called "Chinese Bund," have to ask clearly.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Residents Should Pay Attention to Summer Cold Drinks on the Market <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Illness enters through the mouth; diet and health are closely related. Those who value hygiene usually pay attention to their food. Especially in summer, when various infectious diseases are prevalent, all food and drinks must be given extra attention. Once summer arrives, the hot weather makes food easily spoil. Moreover, flies are swarming, which are also vectors of cholera. Therefore, if one is careless with diet, illness is inevitable. This not only harms one's health but can also endanger one's life. As for the summer drinks sold on the market, such as iced water, sour plum juice, soda, and fruit露 (juice/syrup), many are unhygienic, and we must pay extra attention to them.</p>
<p>This summer, the city's health bureau is working very hard to prevent infectious diseases. Since the beginning of summer, it has been conducting city-wide immunization injections and disinfection of ditches and canals in various places. Recently, considering that the milk and cold drinks sold by various merchants in the market are consumed by many people, it is difficult to avoid the sale of inferior products mixed in without strict and constant inspections, which would harm people's health. Therefore, it specifically collected samples and ordered the health laboratory to conduct detailed inspections. Regarding milk, seven companies have been inspected this month. The number of bacteria per cubic centimeter was too high and did not meet the prescribed standards. They have been strictly ordered to pay attention to cleanliness and thoroughly disinfect. It is also heard that samples will be taken from consumers for inspection to ensure thoroughness. Regarding cold drinks, twenty-one types of soda have been inspected, and only two types passed. Forty-four types of fruit露 have been inspected, and only two types passed. Also, three samples of sour plum juice were inspected, and none passed. The unqualified products all had too many bacteria and did not meet the city's standards. If they contain germs, consumers are even more likely to get sick. The health bureau has now notified all unqualified manufacturers and ordered them to make thorough improvements for re-inspection.</p>
<p>From the results of this inspection by the health bureau, we find that most of the drinks sold on the market today are indeed unhygienic. The general public should pay great attention and be extra careful.</p>

<p>— Jing Fu</p>
<p>"The foot of Han Mountain, east of Xiang Bridge..." When such magnificent singing faintly floats into my mind, I seem to be able to distinguish that it is played from the unrestrained tone of young people! It gently awakens in me the jumping of the souls of young people, in the same mood and timbre as the song, awakening the dancing reflections of those scenes that have disappeared and become blurred like dreams...</p>
<p>"The foot of Han Mountain, east of Xiang Bridge..." This is a song that a group of us young people used to dance and sing often about seven or eight years ago. But now, I can only remember this</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>first sentence. This can be seen as a trace of the whip of life smashing old dreams to pieces over the years! However, this mere sentence remaining in my memory is enough to bring the scene of that year vividly back to life.</p>
<p>Climbing Han Mountain and looking out, a long, winding, vast, and majestic Han River encircles the dense city of Chaozhou. The city, eager to leap, and the river, majestic and far-reaching, reflect each other in the mist and water, making the scenery as vivid as a beautiful woman dancing. Looking far into the distance, the sand is white on the southwestern side, and flocks of birds are playing. Below the beach and water is a bamboo forest, a large bamboo kingdom that sways all day long. That is a famous small island by the river, light and pure in appearance, with a sense of being detached from the world. Facing the bamboo forest from afar stands Ke Xi Pagoda, tall and majestic, lush and ancient, with a powerful aura that still strikes people even from a distance. Turning my eyes back, I look down at Xiangzi Bridge, neat, light, and beautiful, like a rainbow across the sky. The people on the bridge seem like objects in a wonderful painting, vaguely indistinct, yet coming steadily and going far away. Beside and under the bridge, on both sides of the river, green waves ripple like brocade, and boats play on the water, which cannot help but make one's mind wander. Slowly counting the scenery coming from Jiangdong, all the way to the foot of Han Mountain bordering the river, I sighed a sweet and comfortable sigh, and felt relaxed all over! Raising my head and focusing my gaze on the vast sky, a majestic wind blows towards my face, the spirit of youth leaps up, I shake my head and sing loudly, truly as if in a dream.</p>
<p>Stepping on green hills, grasping green trees, listening to birds singing, sitting in dense shade, stroking the clear stream that gurgles like music, I simply soak my feet, which, though I am a student, often like to wear wooden clogs, into the cool water, acting like a child, oblivious to the world! That is the soul of my youth, that is the beautiful dream of my teens!</p>
<p>After wandering around and getting tired, I linger to the dormitory, and the chime of the ancient temple to the left scatters elegantly in the quiet and beautiful foothills. This also reminds me of Han Yu's Han Wengong Temple on the mountain, which is why it is named Han Mountain. Stepping across Xiangzi Bridge and picking up the slanting stone steps to climb, the ancient temple stands majestically above, quietly accompanied by the gentle breeze, old pine trees, fragrant flowers, and various warbling birds on the black tile roof outside the wall. I love to sit on the cool stone in front of the temple, exposing my elegant chest, watching tourists, looking at Han Mountain, looking at Xiangzi Bridge, surrounded by a completely intoxicating and serene atmosphere. On the stone tablet beside the temple are the inscriptions of ancient people such as Han Yu and Su Dongpo, carved on the stone in deep black, vigorous, majestic, and ancient characters. From time to time, some foreigners even come to visit! Looking at the traces on the stone, I am immersed in the mood of reminiscing about the past.</p>
<p>Every summer night, the moonlight of Lingnan shines on the foothills of Han Mountain, and the interest of young people becomes even more unusually exuberant. The silvery white moonlight shines all over the deep, quiet mountain, under the trees, the elegant campus, the quiet and elegant old-style dormitory, the windows, and the houses, all adorned with intoxicating moonlight, making the scenery of the foothills of Han Mountain even more beautiful. Therefore, the fluttering and restless spirit will naturally leap into action. Stepping out of the dormitory door, strolling, sitting on a cool stone, under the trees and branches. Chasing after the beauty of the mountains that is blurred and about to melt in the distance, I never feel that it is almost midnight, but the interest is still strong. Then I lie down on the cool and sweet-smelling pavilion, sleeping boldly and freely, breathing in a clear and sweet taste that is so refreshing that it feels almost otherworldly. Sometimes, even though the moon has set in the west and the night is almost over, I am even more fascinated by the blurred colors!</p>
<p>Thinking of these things, I suddenly remember sleeping overnight at the foot of Han Mountain again last year. Although the scenery was the same as before, my heart was so scattered that it was not worth a glance at the face of Han Mountain. And after one night, I couldn't help but leave! That young heart has long been buried!</p>
<h3 id="e188">A Family Letter <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Cheng</p>
<p>Brother, in our hometown, it must be the time when frogs are croaking everywhere in the green grass ponds.</p>
<p>It is said that the city is sensitive to the seasons. Yes, when the swallows return from the south, the streets playing jazz music are already flying the flags of summer sales. But don't the people in the countryside understand these things? Their lives are held in the grip of the seasons. When the migratory birds sing, they sow; now is what we habitually call the plum rain season, when rice seedlings should be transplanted. But reading in the newspaper that drought is looming everywhere, all the experience left by our hundreds of generations of ancestors is in vain.</p>
<p>I remember the image of returning home last year, in fact, it is reflected in my mind all the time; those fields were as hard as pig iron, and the sound of water pumping along the river almost never stopped. The riverbed was exposed like the white belly of a fish, but the fields seemed to be filled with mercury. When the plow hit the ground, it made a dull metallic sound, as unpleasant as an old man drinking too much wine. Every purplish face lost its expression, and angry arms were raised, holding the clay face of the "fierce general" god. At that time, the philanthropists in the city, thinking about the food problem for the coming year, finally brought out Zhang Tianshi to set up an altar and perform rituals. The children of the land, who understood the seasons, looked up at the scorching sun in the sky, and lived on sighs as if they were food.</p>
<p>"There is not a single ox in the countryside, but people are working like oxen!" When you shouted this, you almost looked like you were fighting an enemy. Now your voice and your shadow are floating before my eyes.</p>
<p>I feel very ashamed. Father thought that I was not a "farmer" and we took two different paths. Father's intention was naturally good, farmers will never amount to anything, but what about selling the ancestral property and cultivating me into a so-called "scholar" who graduated from middle school? It seems forgivable that I could not get promoted and make a fortune as my father had expected, but I have been struggling to fill my stomach for many years, and now I don't even have the courage to speak! Although scholars and farmers take two completely different paths, the result is that my father is completely disappointed.</p>
<p>But the previous generation knew how to accept adversity. When I returned home last year, Father still entrusted his dreamlike hope to me. He wanted me to be patient, old eagles have eyes, and scholars will always have their day! He repeated the story of the top scholar Lu to us under the kerosene lamp, smiling like that.</p>
<p>"There will always be a day to turn things around!" he concluded, puffing on his pipe hard.</p>
<p>Brother, at that time, I saw you rolling your bloodshot eyes, and I knew that you could no longer bear that kind of philosophy of "patience". But Father took patience as a "family motto", and our ancestors started from patience. Although Father didn't say a word when he saw me off on the boat that day,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>I knew that his only teaching, "patience," was about to burst out, but we parted in such silence. Perhaps he was not sure that "patience" was a successful creed.</p>
<p>The day after I received your letter, it rained, but the news of floods came again. Now the seasons are out of order, and the people in the countryside, who are held in the grip of the seasons, can no longer be patient. You said that the people who are working like oxen this year have abandoned the lessons inherited from their ancestors. In fact, all of this is in vain. Sensitive people in the city are thinking about how to help our rural areas! You might laugh out loud when you hear this news, right?</p>

<p>In the scene of "Little Aunt," Luo Jun and Xia Peizhen met for the first time through Ying Yin's introduction. Both were shy and speechless. Ying Yin urged them to talk. So, Luo Jun said:</p>
<p>"Sister! Do you have classes in the classroom?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Brother-in-law!" Xia Peizhen replied.</p>
<p>"Then, your school is closed on Sundays, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"Then, you eat lunch at noon?"</p>
<p>But Xia Peizhen couldn't help but laugh. Knocking on the teacup...</p>
<p>Zhang Lingling told her friend, "I got the best score on the social studies test this time, I got ninety-eight points!"</p>
<p>The friend said, "If I went to knock on this teacup, I could have done even better, isn't my strength a little greater than yours?" Teapot smashed...</p>
<p>Xu Suzhen can speak Cantonese. The fake Han Lagen, Zhao Tushan, asked him to teach: "Please teach me how to pronounce the three characters "Zhao Tushan" in Cantonese?"</p>
<p>The answer is: "Tea kettle (Zhao) broken (Tushan)!" Everyone then...</p>
<p>"Little Aunt" actor Yao Ping bought a two-cent loaf of bread and asked the shop assistant why the bread was smaller than before. The shop assistant said that the bread is small so it's more convenient for you to eat, so Yao Ping gave a cent and took the bread, saying, "Then, everyone is convenient, your counting price is also convenient."</p>
<h3 id="e191">"Jade Horse" is Thrilling and Exciting <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>"Jade Horse" is Xu Xinfu's first sound dialogue feature film, and is currently working day and night at the photography site, and will be completed soon. "Jade Horse" is a film with the anti-drug movement as its theme. The film depicts an organized drug manufacturing organization that manufactures a large number of drugs (his trademark is a pair of jade horses). Detective Wang Tiemin is the strongest opponent of drug prohibition. He uses all means and goes through countless hardships, and finally cracks this "jade horse" trademarked drug manufacturing organization. The set design is by Dong Tianya. This features bizarre and tortuous secret room tunnels, and magnificent new-style buildings. The magnificence of the set is also a feature of the film. The overall atmosphere is full of adventure and excitement, and will undoubtedly refresh the audience.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Hu Die and "Tuberose" <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Since Hu Die went abroad, our movie audiences have not enjoyed Hu Die's new works for a long time. Her recent works before she went abroad were the sound dialogue film "Tuberose," written and directed by Cheng Bugao. That film was as beautiful and elegant as a flower with a subtle fragrance. Because of Hu Die's departure, the film has not yet been completed. Now that Ms. Hu is on her way back to the country, then, not long after, we can see the moving performance of this artist called "genius" in "Tuberose."</p>
<h3 id="e193">Introducing "Nostalgia" <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Shen Xiling, known for his two films, "Women's Cry" and "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours," his third creation, "Nostalgia," is now being screened at the Xin Guangda Theater.</p>
<p>In "Women's Cry," because it was his first time directing, he could not fully use his artistic skills, but the audience could almost clearly see the superiority of the young director's skills. The premiere of "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours" fully demonstrated his artistic genius and his just exposure of dissatisfaction with reality. The technique of contrasting the rich and the poor truly touched people's hearts.</p>
<p>This time, Shen Xiling, with his righteous poet's emotion, entrusted his infinite grief for his motherland in "Nostalgia." The entire film is full of exuberant passion, like a poignant and generous epic—this film is dubbed and shot, starring Xuan Jinglin, Gao Qianping, Sun Min, Zhao Dan, Mei Xi, and others.</p>

<p>(1) "Boatman's Daughter" has been completely filmed. Director Shen Xiling is now composing music for the film's scenes, and his work is very intense.</p>
<p>(2) In Xu Xinfu's directed "Jade Horse," there is a magnificent hotel set designed by Dong Tianya, which cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>(3) Li Pingqian and Wu Cun's self-written new works have now been completed. Once the review committee passes, the two films can be filmed at the same time.</p>
<p>(4) Zhang Shichuan has recently been working hard to film "Big Family," and has taken the time to write an article "Since I Became a Director" for the Star Bimonthly; it is heard that this article will be completed by the seventh issue at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Zhou Hu's Paris <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Paris Communication: Zhou Jianyun and Hu Die have traveled to various European countries and have now arrived in Paris a few days ago. On the second day of their arrival, Chinese compatriots in France held a grand welcome party for them at the Paris Chinese Student Association. After the chairman gave a welcome speech, Hu Die stood up to give a reply. Zhou Jianyun gave a brief report on their trip abroad. Zhou's conversation was interspersed with a few jokes from time to time, which always caused laughter throughout the venue. After the meeting, a public banquet was held for Zhou Hu at the Wanhua Building. They were then led to the nearby Luxembourg Gardens to take pictures and dispersed happily. According to Zhou, they must stay in Paris for two or three days, and then go to London, Rome, and other places. When they leave Europe, it will be around June 15th, and it may not be until the beginning of July that they can return to their motherland.</p>
<h3 id="e196">"Autumn Fan Bright Lamp" <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The film "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp" is the latest production of Lianhua Film Company, with all dubbing and singing. The plot in the film has a long process, events of the past ten years or so, which become strange changes after ten years. With complex plots on many sides, it constitutes a situation of sorrow and joy. Streams converge, in an orderly manner. The director, Tan Youliu, has a strong spirit and performs in a well-organized manner, and the strength of the drama is undoubtedly increased. The control of the actors in the whole drama is also very suitable. Li Lili plays from her girlhood to her middle age. Each period can be considered in detail. Li herself said, "Since acting in films, this film is the most laborious." She is known for playing young girls, but now she also has excellent achievements in playing middle-aged women. A capable person can naturally do everything. Diao Banhua, as a new actor, first showed her skills in "New Woman" and showed her talent. She plays an important role in this film. Even a small test of her skills is already outstanding, and her future will be limitless. Other actors such as Gu Menghu, Jiang Junchao, and Han Lagen all have special achievements. In short, this film, whether in terms of plot, direction, or actors, proves its greatness everywhere. In addition to the beautiful music and singing, it adds a lot of color to this film.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Who is Your Lifeline? <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Li Lili was preparing to record the song for "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp", and the song "You Are My Lifeline" was constantly humming in her mouth all day long. Sitting "You Are My Lifeline," walking "You Are My Lifeline" holding a newspaper is also "You Are My Lifeline," eating wontons is also "You Are My Lifeline," it's simply "Lifeline" everywhere. Therefore, Diao Banhua, who is inseparable from her, couldn't help but laugh, "Really like a madman, who is your lifeline?" Banhua asked like this, which was very interesting, and immediately made Li Lili's face fly up with a few red clouds.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Xinhua Quick News <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
