<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國白銀法案之將來與世界銀市</h3>
<p>自美國於一九三四年五月十二日成立白銀購買法案以來。世界銀市。曾因是發生重大之變化。無論産銀國或用銀國皆受影響。近據漢迪哈門一年來世界銀市情形之報告。（本月七日路透社紐約電）與國民社美國金銀存底變動之統計。（本月三日國民社華盛頓電）　實足使吾人對於美國白銀法案之成效。獲一極端明確認識之機會。吾人於此世界銀市變化莫測之時。一爲回溯。亦殊有興味也。</p>
<p>夫美國白銀購買法案。實倡於美國停止購金政策。而積極從事减低美金價值之後。爲美國貨幣戰爭整個運動過程中之一節目。由該法案本身之含義言。實與美國一九三三年於倫敦經濟會議中所成立之白銀恊定。相牴觸之處甚多。蓋倫敦銀恊定之基本目的。在於穏定銀市。而白銀購買法案之結局。則不啻促起銀市之抬高。此不惟美國「紐約國民城銀行月報」編者認爲非用銀國之利益。（本月二日紐約路透電）卽世界人士。亦莫不同具此觀感也。</p>
<p>美國白銀法案之結局。固足使世界銀價騰高。但其所以致此之故。則實由於該法案之最終目標。在於完成美國硬貨準備金三銀一之比例。吾人按照一九三四年四月底美國國庫存金總額七、七一一六、○○○、○○○元推算。必除去當時已有存銀。待購之銀。約爲數達一、三五○、○○○、○○○盎士。然後與金三銀一之比例相合。然而美國以貿易出超而兼海外投資甚巨之國家。能否每年吸收世界巨量黄金入國乎。此爲大可注意之問題。據國民社訊。則去年十二月底美國存金。約已增至八、二三二、○○○、○○○元之巨。事實上存銀增加之速率。幾與存金相若。如此則金三銀一之比例。卽有無由實現之勢。而購銀法案之效力。亦卽有完全喪失之虞。事實上縱不至此。吾人亦不能不作如是之感想也。若謂金銀存底之發達。備爲戰爭時期之應用。則其意義又當别論之矣。</p>
<p>然則美國之白銀法案。對於目前之美國。果爲全無利益之舉動歟。則又不然。據漢迪哈門之報告。美國於過去一年中。吸收世界供給之銀。達三一七、四四○○、○○○盎士。其有助於世界之銀價向上。自非細小。因銀價之向中。乃使世界銀之生産。達於一八一、二○○、○○○盎士。而造成此四年以來未有之現象。須知世界生銀産額百分之六十。旣爲美國資本所操縱獨佔。則試問其他各國所受之影響將何如。美國白銀派之再接再厲。以盡力造成此生産向上之奇績。其目的何在。自可不言而喻。若謂其用意在於穏定世界之銀價。又誰信之耶。</p>

<h3>美銀政策無變更</h3>
<p>但力避擾亂我國金融</p>
<p>中美談判無具體發展</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美聯社今日自可靠方面得悉、美國之白銀政策、將與國務總理赫爾於十月十二日所致中國駐美公使施肇基照會中之大綱、實質上無大變更、上届國會所通過之購銀法係命令式、惟其進行方法可由政府自定、祗須不背宗旨而已、是故美國政府當盡力避免擾亂中國經濟財政之舉動、十月十二日赫爾發表聲明之後、中美兩國雖曾不時交換意見、然根本上並無新發展、足以改變美國之政策、財長毛根鞱今日向報界發言亦稱、關於中國之白銀問題、彼除國務總理赫爾所言者外無所增益、且美國亦不願對於其白銀政策再有表示、因無論所言者爲何、終爲經營白銀之商人利用之以事投機也云、</p>
<p>據今日商部所發表之統計、財部雖否認减少購銀、然十二月份美國白銀輸入之數確祗及十一月份之半數强、蓋十二月份之白銀輸入祗美金八、七一○、六八五元、而上月則爲一五、○一○、五六一元也、美國所向之購銀之國以英爲主、計三、○八六、○八五元、墨西哥次之、計二、一五五、九六三元、中國計一、一二六七七七元、輸出總數十二月份爲一、○一三、七三二元、十一月份爲一、六九七、六五七元、現金流入美國勢仍未息、惟已稍减、十二月份之輸入爲九二、二四九、三五四元、上月份則爲一二一、一九八、六四五元、輸出之數甚微、祗一二九、八七七元、上月份亦祗三○九、六五九元、財部今日聲稱、十二月份全國通行之白銀庫券及銀幣已大爲增加、亦足表示政府重用白銀計劃之推進、據財部統計、十二月份增發之銀券銀幣達三五·六六七·七四三元、致流通總數已達新高點九一七·九五五·四八八元、美國通貨總值則由五·五四八·五三三·九三七元减至五·五三五·七一三·二六九元、若以銀貨增加之數合併計之、足見政府已將其他貨幣幣收回四八·四八八·四一一元矣、查十十月份銀券之流通總數已自五五八·三五七·一八○元增至五九一·五六三·四一七元、銀輔幣自二九一·一二七·八八一元增至二九四·三四五·九六五元、而標凖銀元則自三一·七九七·六八四元增至三二·○四六·一○六元云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）衆院錢幣委員會主席蘇默斯今日與美聯社記者談話、對於本届國會將表决重要幣制法之説表示懷疑、蘇氏不但以爲國會將不再改動美元之黄金成份、且以爲並無其他白銀計劃、近來政府方面雖曾屢次表示仍將購進鉅額現銀、然據蘇氏之意、財都購銀之舉終將無甚結果、因購銀之踴躍與否、須視物價是否能因此提高爲斷、説中國旣不願售銀、而墨西哥亦存銀不多、財部亦無從購起、「現在財政部之權力已非常充足、卽欲重以白銀爲美元本位、亦未尙不可、故實不覺有另議白銀法之必要、至减少黄金成分一事、卽有此意、亦當由政府提出、蓋財部對於此種情形較爲詳細也云、再民主黨衆議員戴氏曾要求以其二項幣制提案公開討論、其提案如下、（一）所有美國通貨概以標凖銀元兑現、（二）財部以後將减少美元黄金成份所得之利益、概充農業費用、兹悉衆院領袖對於能否以該二提案</p>

<h3>羅斯福主張穏定國際貨幣</h3>

<h3>海軍新條約不成英將擴充海軍</h3>

<p>（倫敦）　據每日電聞報海軍記者裴華德稱、如海軍會議未能成立新條約、則英國海軍部承認、一九三六年應有一補充鑑隊之大海軍計劃、一九三五年之海軍預算規定建造九千噸巡洋艦二艘、或三艘、小巡洋艦一艘、驅逐艦八艘及潛艇三艘、海軍官兵人數亦將增加、此外並將積極進行空防軍備、發展攻擊性之空軍、並在較大之戰艦上裝置飛機升降設備、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>美海軍當局不贊成袖珍艦</h3>
<p>仍以重艦爲主力</p>
<p>（華盛頓）袖珍戰艦雖引起歐洲政界及海軍界之注意、但美國海軍界認爲不足取、美聯社曾向海軍當局提出問題、謂如海軍條約廢棄及海軍造艦競爭成爲各國公開之事實後、美國海軍所造之新戰艦究以何種最爲重要、高級海軍當局答稱、美國將繼續建造平衡之艦隊、換言之、卽龐大之主力艦、飛機母艦及裝甲重巡洋艦仍將爲海軍之主力、並將繼續建造驅逐艦及補助艦、務使其與已成及建造中之主力艦隻數成正比例、袖珍戰艦僅爲受嚴格限制之艦隊、及因條約關係不能建</p>
<p>造重艦之國家所歡迎、但彼等一遇現在及將來之主力艦卽歸無效、因主力艦所備之重砲及軍器能消滅此項袖珍戰艦也、且袖珍戰艦未能引起日本及英國之注意、現在之海軍條約廢止後、英日兩國將在造艦計畫中、繼續謀取艦隊之平衡、並將依照比例、增加主力艦之隻數、英日兩國均不願建造袖珍戰艦、或漫無限制建造威力不足之潛艇或輕巡洋艦、以削弱其國防云、（十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>薩爾明日總投票歐洲露不安之象</h3>
<p>法意奥陳兵邊境</p>
<p>投票人大批入薩</p>
<p>（倫敦）薩爾公民投票之日期轉瞬卽届、歐洲各政府皆露不安之象、據可靠消息、奥意政府戒備非常嚴密、蓋恐德人在薩爾勝利後、意外事端或將繼之而起也、聞意兵現厚集奥邊、如德國國社黨於薩爾公民投票後希圖在奥舉事、　則意兵卽將出而對付之、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法國軍事當局爲星期日薩爾投票事、對於薩爾邊界正進行大規模之防禦工作、計有活動警衛軍十一隊及汽車等分佈各重要地點、此外復有税警四十八隊作爲後備隊、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　担任各處公民投票所主席之荷蘭瑞士公務人員六百六十五人頃已乘專車及汽車抵此、中途未釀事端、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　南美薩爾人昨續到六十、凖備參加公民投票、明日有五萬餘人專爲此事來自德國、豫料將有盛大之歡迎、届時敬察彈壓、必甚費力、昨到之人、歡迎者大呼各種口號、有呼希特勒萬歲者、有呼維持現局者、亦有唱國際歌者、明日所到人中、有德國駐維也納專使巴本夫婦、因二人居於薩爾、故有投票資格也、海外歸此之投票者、其旅費雖由日耳曼陣線代付、但其中有自稱擬投票反對以薩爾歸還德國者、有一投票人遠自日本歸來、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　日耳曼陣線今日諭令擁護德國者明晚一律在家張燈結綵、以便認識、但反對方面亦立卽諭令反對派倣其所爲、公民投票委員會現已佈置投票結果之公佈　事宜、届時將由華堡廳用無線電佈告歐洲八國、然後始許新聞記者將投票經過之情形用電報或電話傳佈於外、當局用無線電廣播投票結果之目的、在使人民在家聽信、庶免羣衆集於街中、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　據聞公民投票委員會對於檢票一舉業已决定新辦法、卽於星期一日午後五時左右開始、而於星期二日午产有八時揭曉云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>各處主任宣誓</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　薩爾全境爲公民投票所設選舉所、共計九百○一處、各有主任一名、其中瑞士人三百名、荷蘭人三百五十人、盧森堡公國人二百三十名、餘則分屬各中立國人民、今晨九百○一主任、在此間華德堡大會塲舉行宣誓、公民投票委員會全體蒞臨監誓、由委員會主席、瑞典人羅德發表簡短訓辭、繼乃分爲三處、瑞士籍各主任在瑞士籍委員亨利之前、荷蘭籍主任在荷蘭籍委員德榮之前、盧森堡及他國籍主任則在羅德之前、宣誓、謂「余誓本榮譽及良心執行余所接受之權力、」宣誓之時、並無證人在塲、禮畢、各主任重返大會塲、由委員會主席羅德令各新聞記者、及攝影師退出後、乃發給訓令、據一般人所知、此項訓令内容係採取防範手段、俾投票得保守秘密而不發生舞弊情事、遇有必要時並當聲請軍警干涉云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德方準備慶祝</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　薩爾區域公民投票日期日益迫近、薩爾人民政治情緒亦愈益緊張、近日雖未發生嚴重之衝突事件、件輕微事端則層見迭出、主張歸併德國與主張維持現狀兩派對抗之尖鋭於此可見、昨日有維持現狀派報紙之販報人數人在街頭遭國社黨毆辱、其中一人失去一目、午後適舉僑美薩爾人抵此、國社黨乘機舉行示威、倘無警察干涉、則恐已釀成嚴重之鬥毆矣、因投票日期將届、國社黨宣傳倍加努力、恃其人數衆多、對於不願表示反對現制度之少數維持現狀派加以恫嚇、國社黨甚且不恤用恐怖主義之手段、歸併德國派對於投票結果勝利已十分信任、德國陣綫團在各處張貼通告、凖備慶祝薩爾區域歸還德國、家这长空地内滿堆松枝以備結綵之用、居民並備竹竿、以張掛慶祝用之旌旗、今日復有大批投票者將自德國乘專車多利來此、一般人以預料國社黨更將乘機作大規模之示威運動云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>袒法招貼發現</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　昨日各大街忽發見袒法之巨大揭貼、内謂如薩爾居民願維持現局、則法國决不立於中途、如居民願保留法國圜幣與市場、則法國願歡然接受之、法國擔保一切權利、而無種族語言或意見之分别、法國乃自由與人道之土地云云、見者皆爲駭然、旋警察奉上峯之命撕毁之、但未幾公民投票委員會又命勿撕、因聞乃袒法派所張貼者也、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法當局深信、倘投票結果於德方有利者、則必有多數人民離薩入法、故法國之邊防軍已奉命將此種移民於抵法境時立即運送至法國内地、其允許留居於莫賽爾省之移民以三千人爲限、惟須確是法人後裔、或已取得法國國籍者、并爲此種僑民之安全起見、法當局已有周詳之凖備、全國各地已可收容僑民四萬人之譜、按此種僑民之必須於投票之後遷入法境者、計爲分裂派共産黨徒、恐怖份子等、彼等在薩爾之行動、已深爲當地民衆所不滿、故事後必須遷地爲良也、（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>委員會之禁令</h3>
<p>（柏林）　薩爾投票委員云、頃又發出新命令、禁止由德國開往薩爾之專車於入薩爾境時懸旗及張貼　標語於車之内外、此消息今夜在德廣事傳佈、蓋明日卽有專車載運三千三百人由柏林等處開往薩爾投票也、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　薩爾統治委員會今日下令、限制一月十一日至十五日公民投票期内、僅有正式郵航及經官方特許之飛機始得在薩爾上空飛過、其他一律在禁止飛行之列、聞事前業經該會與德政府商得同意云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　薩爾區域公民投票委員會曾要求法德兩國、從今晚起、停止無綫電宣傳、法國政府業經電復、不再以無綫電宣傳、但以德國同樣辦理爲條件、德國處理薩爾事務委員布克爾則於今日復函、謂因一月六日　法國斯脱拉斯堡無綫電台播送薩爾區域及國社黨陣綫領袖福爾脱與撲朗之演説、故不允接受停止無綫電宣傳之約束云、因此法總無綫電宣傳仍將繼續不能停止、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　因薩爾區域公民投票舉行在卽、德國各無綫電播音台　於今晚一律播送宣傳歌曲、歌名「薩爾者德國之薩爾也」、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英使訪德外長</h3>
<p>（柏林）　英國駐柏林大使斐浦斯爵士今日訪德外長午賴特、請於薩爾投票後、國聯開特别會議時出席、因法律上德國仍爲國聯會員也、德外長當答稱、德國旣已自行退出國聯、則爲根本原則起見、不能再行參與國聯會議、牛氏又云、據各方報告、薩爾之永久隷屬問題尙須有待於國聯會議之决定、此事德國頗不以爲然、此種無謂之延遲勢必影響於該區經濟利益也云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　衆料薩爾問題將卽辦理、行政院手續之繁簡、全視公民投票之結果而定、如各區投票悉主以地交還德國、或主維持現局、則事卽易辦、如一區投此票、彼區投他票、則該問題將益見複雜、勢不能不展緩决議、但此爲最後之一着、因自下人人皆願儘速了結薩爾問題也、英政府建議德或應派代表參加國聯行政院會議、德政府雖感謝英國之友好精神、但柏林批評者皆謂如專爲所涉及原則之故、則德政府之拒絶參加、甚爲得當云、德意志報記者謂德國之以消極態度對付日内瓦實因國聯不能承認德國所提出權利平等要求所致、德國今無出席行政院會議之必要、蓋該會議僅將討論關於薩爾問題之純粹正式决議也、柏林日報記者謂德國之拒絶出席、或出於對外間盛傳德國將返國聯之謡言不欲有所表示之志願、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>法意羅馬協約奥所日夕盼望</h3>
<p>奥外長發表宣言</p>
<p>（維也納）　奥國外長魏德格頃向哈瓦斯社代表發表宣言、謂意相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾、最近在羅馬所完成之事業、無論就歐洲觀點或就中歐觀點、均屬非常重要、此種事業固屬吾人所日夕盼望者也、羅馬恊定足使意大利與南斯拉夫之持久諒解、獲有鞏固之希望、其於匈牙利與南斯拉夫亦然、蓋相互不干涉内政公約一旦成立、則政治犯庇護權、自可有一各國所恊定之限制、而不至濫用矣、羅馬恊定之結果、首將由中歐各國分别訂結雙方恊定、其次乃入於有事時、相互磋商之階段、夫如是則不啻成立一新維也納會議、而歐洲乃獲持久之和平矣、吾人不信汎歐政策、在目前有實現之可能、然經濟的汎歐聯盟、則必可於將來逐步求其實現、此則又必以法意恊定爲基礎、法意接近之足以慶賀者、職是故也云云、魏德格最後表示、彼將於二月間與總理休樞尼格、同赴巴黎聘問云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（維也納）　總理休樞尼格、本日對各要人作長時間講演、所談者爲内政外交上各問題、演講時情形頗爲秘密、與會者均爲奥大利各界要人、如維也納大主敎伊尼載、内閣人員、省長數人、敎會及學界要人等、總理演講題目、爲「奥國與歐洲、奥國與德國」、此外尙有内政問題、而德奥恢復正常關係之主要條件、似爲總理演説之主要目的、演詞全文、行將以公報發表之、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法國參謀部機關巴黎廻聲之國際政治記者、波丁那氏今日在該報重要地位披露、德法軍備問題一文、稱法外長賴伐爾在羅馬時已獲得意首相墨索里尼氏之贊許、法國軍備必須優於德國、但此節似不如其外表所示之重要、因最主要之點、英外相西門氏在十二月十二日與佛蘭亭及賴伐爾二氏之談話中、已同意取消去年四月十七日法前外長巴爾都氏之牒文也、佛蘭亭及賴伐爾二氏與英外相談話時、復面允德國之重整軍備在原則上附以某種條件之後卽可認爲合法、惟賴伐爾此舉顯已陷入無底止之交涉中、且事前未得最高軍事委員會之同意、勢將使法國軍備問題陷於僵局也、波丁那氏復稱、意大利之贊同法國軍備之優於德國、其實際上之價值、必須俟管理及裁制二問題確定之後始可見之、但管理及裁制在今日尙望其能成功者、則僅屬空想而已云、（十日國民電）</p>

<h3>金銀</h3>
<p>倫敦金價　今日金價漲五便士、價爲一百四十一先令九便士半、</p>
<p>倫敦大條　今銀價、現貨爲二十四便士四三七五、期貨爲二十四便士五六二五、皆跌一二五、其主因爲印度與投機家之轉賣、但美國與中國於價落時購進、收盤尙穏、</p>
<p>芒特里銀　今日銀市、期貨低落三十磅音、因倫敦電訊欠佳也、</p>
<h3>滙兑</h3>
<p>英美　倫敦外匯市况、今晨又形清淡、英美匯價開盤、爲四元九角一分一八七五、比昨日美英收盤低一八七五、十一時漲起二五、午時又漲一二五、而達四元九角一分五六二五、午後二時此價未變、又美金一元、合英金四先令零八二四、</p>

<h3>橡皮</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日市况開盤雖穏、但午時四五月期成交價格、爲六便士七五、較諸昨日收盤低一二五、今晨跌風、乃存底漸增所致、</p>
<p>紐約　今因倫敦市價鬆動、故開盤跌十一至十二磅音、跌後購者無多、故價尙有更低之趨勢</p>
<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>紐約　合盛洋行報告、證券開盤前有利於市况之因素爲、（一）證市漲風雖續受阻力、但多方了結並無增多之氣象、（二）公用股票之起色、似表示公用股票之多頭了結現已中止、而不利於市况之因素、則爲美國最高法院刻正考慮債欵契約中金條文之廢除是否合法、此事使證券貿易續受限制、俟此案判定後、交易方可望發展、</p>
<p>又據路透社報告、今晨垣街所最注意者、爲刻在最高法院奮鬥中政府債券廢除金條文是否合法之問題、商人現急待此案之切實結果、同時證券市塲之活動、定因此而受限制、今晨證券開盤、市况清淡、交易微細、各種股票大都微漲、油股似又下趨、路股亦稍受壓力、實業股票仍有人購進、而美國鋼業股票、開盤時成交尙多、據説者推測、今日市况或將稍堅、不過選擇性質之購買、終不免爲一般漲風之阻力耳、兹將紐約證券市價列左、</p>

<h3>新西比利亞大鐵道（海參崴通信）</h3>
<p>開發煤鐵石油</p>
<p>建立軍事交通</p>
<p>先進工業國家産業發展順序、總是由輕工業開頭、如英國是、後進工業國家産業發達、也是由輕工業順次向重工業發展、如日本是、因爲輕工業偏重於人民日常生活必需品的生産、所以出産品無論在國内國外、都容易找消售的市塲、個人的營利經營、也很容易見利、祗有蘇聨很特别、第一五年計劃開始時、就着全力於重工業、到如今歐洲方面的蘇俄、已經相當的發達起來了、例如銑鐵生産、一九三四年度的豫計、有一千萬噸以上、占世界第二位、僅次於美國、而多過日本的五倍、鋼的生産、一九三四年度豫算要有九百三十萬噸以上、要越過英國、低於美國和德意志、却有日本的兩倍半、</p>
<p>蘇聯對這一點、並不以爲滿足、單開發了歐洲那一部人、到底還不够、何况她的工業建設目標、是指向着一九二九年最繁榮的美國、以美國重工業爲凖繩而從事的、現在大體上第一五年計劃完成、第二五年計劃開工、所以西比利亞、尤其是東部西比利亞、不可忽視、要從事開發、則舊的西比利亞大鐵道、敷設了複軌、也還是不够用、並且北部一帶廣原、包含着極豐富的煤·鐵·石油·黄金等鑛、</p>
<p>據最近的調查、蒲勒亞的煤炭鑛、藏有五十萬萬噸、小興嶺南脈一帶的鐵鑛、埋藏有四萬二千萬噸、將這兩大鑛區結合起來、就可以形成一所極大的金屬工業聯合工廠、卽所謂「蒲洛斯托洛逸」區是也、還有貝爾湖北部的石油、與庫頁島北部石油的聯絡、波塔波附近的金鑛與塞耶河中流的金鑛、都是東西比利亞的特産、足以使它繁榮、開闢將來的新區域、但是西比利亞鐵道、不能完成這項任務、單由烏蘇里鐵道修築支綫、也不敷用、</p>
<p>因此纔於今年秋季着手計劃、從伊爾庫次克西邊的「泰蕭特」地方開始、經過布拉特斯克·波塔波·統貝加爾湖北部平原、穿過阿爾丹河·過陳塔而至黑龍江出海口的廟街、再有一個計劃、是同上路綫、到「陳塔」折向東南、穿過上述蒲洛斯托洛逸工業區、越黑龍江到蘇維特灣爲終點、其間有三條支綫、一條是沿黑龍江與伯力聯絡、一條是穿過煤鐵區至「畢拉干」、一條是由陳塔到阿木爾鐵道中心點的塔虎德米格搭、此路全長計一千八百餘公里、三支綫共長七百二十公里、總名呌ＢＡＭ大鐵道、它繞「貝加爾」「麻吉斯托拉利亞」、取各地名的頭一個字母故名、沿路綫最困難的事、是人烟稀少、給養不足、現在蘇聯政府、已着手運十幾萬半强迫勞工到那邊去、並且建立臨時住屋、更奬勵人民到那一帶地方去居住、開發…等等、由到那一帶去的人、都能得相當的優遇、</p>
<p>在産業方面的意義、就上面簡單的叙述、已表明了它的重要性、而實際的内容、還不止如此、蘇聯的近勢、其國際的假想敵人、在遠東誰都知道是誰、萬一發生意外、由赤塔到海參崴爲止、駐兵不過二十萬、這樣長的路綫、這樣廣大的原野、要從歐洲運兵來、須十天以上的途程、的確是很費事的、對手方面却便利得多、因此她以爲阿木爾鐵道與烏蘇里鐵道的聯絡、難免不被襲擊、軍事運輸迅速和安全、都不敢講有十分的把握、然而蘇聯决定要堅守其領土、保持她天賦的資源、那末西比利亞鐵道、就不能完全負担這種任務了、於是計劃ＡＢＭ大鐵道、豫備再經兩個冬期完成、現在已先着手前述的三條支綫、由陳塔到塔虎德米格塔一綫、將先完成、沿黑龍江到伯力也開工了、其工程情形何如、因爲屬於軍事性質、外界難於明瞭、總之ＡＢＭ鐵道是含有特别重大意義的、（十二月三十日）</p>

<h3>一九三四年世界郷濟的回顧（續二）　穆藕初</h3>
<p>畜牧生産物的價格，其跌落情形也非常普遍，各國幾無不同。今將一九三四年四月十二日與一九三三年同日，牧畜生産物在英國市塲的批發價格，比較如次：</p>
<p>一九三三年　一九三四年</p>
<p>阿很蜓牛肉　三仙六辨士－四仙　三仙四辨士－三仙八辨士</p>
<p>英國豚肉　五仙——五仙八辨士　五仙六辨士－六仙六辨士</p>
<p>丹麥醃豬肉　六八仙－七四仙　七九仙</p>
<p>丹麥白脱　九○仙－九一仙　八四仙</p>
<p>加拿大乾酪　六○仙－六八仙　五○仙－五八仙</p>
<p>（據世界經濟年報一九三四年第一季報二三頁）</p>
<p>上記的數字，雖不能作絶對標準，但由此可以看出農業恐慌之一斑了。自然，有的物品的價格是高昂了。再將主要商品價格，變更情形，列表如次：</p>
<p>紐約棉花　紐約生絲　芝加哥小麥</p>
<p>每磅　每磅　每Ｂushel（八加倫）</p>
<p>最高　最低　　最高　最低　最高　最低</p>
<p>角　　角　　金元　金元　角　　角</p>
<p>一九三二年　九、二○　五、七○　一、九一　一、一○　六、四○　四三７／８</p>
<p>三九三三年　一一、七五　五、九○　二、二一　一、一○　一、六○　四四５／８</p>
<p>九三年四月至十月　一二、六六　一一、七六　一三、○五　一二、○七　九八、三　八八、○</p>
<p>（「世界往何處去」一九三四年下半期七二頁）</p>
<p>繭價的跌落，前面已有説過，至於棉花價格之高漲，乃是人爲的，絶不能看做好轉的兆徵。「减産恊定」與「縮减生産」，俱爲人爲物價上升的事實。</p>
<p>商品市塲旣受人爲的粉飾，當然影響到物價，故去年各國的物價，都有漸漲的趨勢：尤以日，美高漲爲甚。主要國的物價，其變更情形如次：（一九一三年爲一○○）</p>
<p>日本　　英國　　美國　　德國　　法國</p>
<p>一九三二年最高　一三九·五　九二·二　八一·七　一○○·一　八七·○</p>
<p>最低　一一○·六　八○·九　七一·五　九二·○　七九·○</p>
<p>一九三三年最高　一三九·八　八九·九　九八·三　九六·一　八一·○</p>
<p>最低　　一三三·二　八二·三　六九·○　九一·○　七八·○</p>
<p>一九三四年最高　一三五·四　九二·三　一○二·八　一○○·四　七九·○</p>
<p>（九月止）最低　一三一·五　八九·五　九七·八　九五·八　七三·○</p>
<p>在九個月間，美國平均爲一○○·三，比一九三三年之八三·六顯然增加很大，可是與羅斯福企圖復回到一九二六年之一四一·四的水準，還差得遠。英國最高爲九二·三，比上年亦大有增加，且爲一九三一年以來的最高紀録。日本最高爲一三五·四，比上年最高數雖略减低，但仍爲一九三一年來較高的數字。其中例外的是維持金本位的法國，比上年低落。德國最高爲一○○·四，亦比前年高漲。但法國的低落，是以金本位的關係，要是拿通貨和金物價換算，　則法國的低落，當没有表中所記的數字之大。</p>
<p>在這種物價指數的變動中，我們當亦可看出一年來世界恐慌之大概了。</p>
<p>恐慌的深入，各國自難免發生財政的危機與金融的紛擾。這種現象，在一九三四年，表現更爲顯明。因爲世界各國備戰的迫切，不管財政如何困難，仍不惜支付龐大的軍費。我們試一看各國軍費的數目，便可知戰機的危急了。</p>
<p>日本　　　　　　　　　英國　　　　　　　　美國</p>
<p>軍費　對歲出比率　　軍費　對歲出比率　軍費　對歲出比率</p>
<p>一九三○－三一年　四四三　二八·四％一一一　一三·和％　一九·七％</p>
<p>一九三一－一九三二年　四五四　　三○·七％　一○八　一四·○％　八二五　一六·五％</p>
<p>一九三二－三三年　六八七　三五·二％　一○三　一三·三％　七九一　一五·四％</p>
<p>一九三三－三四年　八七三　三八·七％　一○九　一五·七％　七一六　一○·○％</p>
<p>一九三四－三五年　九三八　四三·八％　一一五　一六·三％　七一一　一五·八％</p>
<p>（據「世界往何處去」一九三四年下半期一二頁，日本單位百萬圓，英國百萬磅，美國百萬金元。）</p>
<p>一九三四年軍費的增加，是各國普遍的現象，其占歲出的比率之大，例如日本幾支二分之一，實堪驚異。美國的軍費在數字上雖較上年略爲减少，但對歲出的比率，仍然是增加。因爲軍費等的增加，各國的預算，便發生所謂「赤字」，於是就不得不募集公債以爲補救了。一九三四年各國所募集的公債，爲數之巨，實開了空前的紀録，這也就是一九三四年世界經濟的一個特色。</p>
<p>兹將七年來世界主要國國債的數額，列舉如次：</p>
<p>日本　英國　　德國　　意大利　美國　法國</p>
<p>單位　百萬圓　百萬鎊　百萬馬克　百萬里拉　百萬金元　百萬法郎</p>
<p>一九二八　五·三九七　七·六三一　七·一三一　八八·二八七　一七·六○四　四六八·六七八</p>
<p>一九二九　五·八三一　七·六二○　八·二二九　八八·九三二　一六·九三一　未詳</p>
<p>一九三○　五·九五九　七·五九七　九·六三○　八九·八七七　一六·一八五　四八二·一二七一九三一　五○九五五　七·五八三　一一·三四二　九三·一七八　一六·八○一　四八○·七七○</p>
<p>一九三二　六·一八七　七·六四七　一一·四三四　九七·二六八　一九·四八七　四八一·一八八</p>
<p>一九三三　七·○五四　七·八六○　一一·六九○　九九·○二九　二二·五三九　四九一·八九九</p>
<p>一九三四　八·一三九　八·○二四　一一·七九三一○·三四七八　二七·○五三　未詳</p>
<p>（日·英·德·法每年以三月爲會計年度，意·美的會計年度則在六月，據「世界往何處去一九三四年下半期二頁）</p>
<p>各國的財政旣是這樣的拮据，金融界紛擾的現象，自屬意中之事。關於金融界的問題，範圍頗廣，誠不易一一叙及，現在我們只舉出以下兩事，來作簡單的考察。（未完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心竊請東投靠情殷</p>
<p>這一篇話，説得王北海却紅了臉。因爲他的東西是那樣不容易來的，他不應該隨便送人。程志前見他紅了臉，未免又想到自已的言語太直了’就向胡嫂子笑道；話雖如此，你不能不領人家的情。呌你領人家的空頭情，又没有這樣的道理。現在就是我出來打這個圓塲罷，明天上午，胡嫂子可以到我這裏，來拿三四斤　去，這　就算是王先生送的。胡嫂子笑道；喲！程老爺一説明白就行了，爲什麽一定還要買　來給我呢？王北海道；那是程先生一番好意，你也不可以埋没了。月英由志前臉上，看到北海臉上，勾了勾頭，低聲道；我們先謝謝了。胡嫂子更是喜笑顔開，不住的道了謝。那月英姑娘，實受得着程志前兩元錢，還没有什麽感想。只有王北海他在這樣的困苦之中，慨然的願意分一半　給人吃，那才是其情可感。因之道謝了向外走着，他的兩隻眼睛。依舊是只管向王北海身上看去。那意思好像是説，我口裏雖説不出來什麽，可是我心裏很感激你呢。因爲他是如此想着，於是先扶了椅子背，次扶了桌子角，再次扶了半開着的房門，他好像兩條腿臨時已經犯了什麽毛病，有些走不動。胡嫂子當他走到房門邊的時候便已三脚兩步走了向前拉着他的袖子道；走罷，不要把借來的衣服弄破了。早早去脱下還人家。他是一句實話，年青而要面子的姑娘，當了那年青的男學生面前，這一分難堪，也不亞於賈多才當面賞鑒他的臉子了。他不再説什麽，跟着胡嫂子走出去了。（一一○）</p>
<h3>王壬秋評封神榜</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>王壬秋湘綺樓日記於封神演義有所論列，兹録之。</p>
<p>「封神演義者本擬水滸傳西遊記而作，亦兼襲三國志，其文有狼笎，在明嘉靖以後，而俗間大信用之，至以改撰神號，至今言四天王哼哈財神溫痘皆本之，已爲市井不刊之典矣，余童時喜其言太極圖有焚身之禍，蓋意在譏明太宗殺方正學諸君。及其言豬狗，佐白　總戎，以譏李景隆諸將，以爲各有所指。然其文衍成數十萬方，必有所命意，乃能敷演。而聞仲者又以擬張江陵不學而跋扈也。其言萎環，又明斥梃擊事。明人喜爲傳奇演義之言，而此獨詼詭不平，多所指斥，大致以財色爲戒，故獨重趙公明兄妹，財爲兄而色爲妹，未有無財而能耽色者也。置之十絶之中者，戕生多端，中年尤在財色也。十絶破而殺仙，萬仙誅而沐猴冠矣，此由庶人以至天子，不可以太極圖自陷於落魂也。故必以太極圖易草菅人命，不可以太子入太極圖，乃憤時嫉俗者之所爲。大要言賢智皆助逆，讒邪皆爲神，唯禽獸乃禽獸乃可通天，甚惡道學之詞，疑李卓吾之所爲也。昔疑其有金丹醫方之説，嘗欲評之，今乃知其仍爲迂儒，故標其作意如此，至其神名，蓋别有所本，非由此始，則無可考矣。</p>
<p>封神榜作者爲誰？近人已考得。孫楷第「中國通俗小説書目」卷五，明清小説部乙，著録云：「封神演義一百回，明許仲琳撰。（注云據明本二卷題」仲琳，南京應天府人，字未詳，號鍾山逸叟。一書藏日本内閣文庫，明刊本此其碩果矣。</p>
<p>壬秋所説，未免出於附會，緣武王伐紂，宋時已有話本，許氏不過推衍擴大之耳，未必有譏彈政治之意也。經生好深文周納，大都類此。壬秋嘗欲評之，幸而未果，否則亦僅如高頭講章，未必能如金聖嘆之具文學眼光也。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （醉痴生）</p>
<p>「十三」旣然是個不祥的名詞，而且是西方人所公認的。那末，世人屬目之薩爾區域人民自决投票，何以偏要揀在一月十三日舉行。倘然引起不祥事件，或歐洲火藥庫，竟因此而爆發。豈不是又要歸咎於「十三」嗎？</p>
<p>十三十三，我爲汝危。</p>
<h3>不景氣中的苦鬭</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>那末似乎微有晴意，因捉了個空，順便上街一走，買些東西。那大街上是怪熱鬧的。男女攘攘熙熙，車輛絡繹不絶。十番細樂，到處可聞。商店門前，彩棚高搭，上繪着「趙子龍單騎救主」，「劉玄德三顧茅廬」，等一類彩畫，引得人們昻首而觀，指手晝脚地批評著。驟見之，誰能説這不是一種昇平氣象呢？</p>
<p>可是有些商店，因豎不起彩棚，僱不起細樂，只好在門前搭起高檯，兩個人立在那裏扮着鬼臉，逼着喉嚨喊。「吕宋帽，兩角洋錢買一頂，冷天戴戴蠻稱心。」這樣更番地喊，這樣更番地逼着喉嚨喊，并且喊得已聲嘶力竭了，檯前的觀衆，也只昻着頭兒，張着嘴兒，對着那鬼臉兒，對着那吕宋帽兒呆瞧。呀！這又是什麽景象呢！</p>
<p>再走下去，又看見兩家俱是一開間門面的鞋舖，并且是貼鄰。一家門前，搭有彩棚，花花綠綠，是怪惹目的。大約那店修理方告工竣，故彩棚兩旁豎有聯對。聯字紅綠相間，語句是，「現在建設成功，開幕照常紀念。」門前人行道上，還擺着清音檯，連行人都走不過去。還有一家，門前是冷清清的，僅高懸一塊木牌。紅紙上，寫着斗大的，「本店大减價」五字；旁邊還有一行潦草的字兒，是：「清音彩棚腐費，原是騙人吃飯矣」！</p>
<p>看到了這，不由的要使人發呆了。同行嫉妬搶生意，出之於通都大邑，原是司空見慣，無足爲奇；而内地亦有此種現象，則又豈獨可以「不景氣」三字目之？「原是騙人吃飯」六字，是於計窮力竭之餘，發出來的一種悲鳴，同時，也帶些怒號的意味的。唉，他們在苦鬥了！</p>
<h3>滬粤觀光機遇霧記（續）</h3>
<p>— 錢華</p>
<p>九時正，飛機在溫州降落，當地各機關代表等都來歡迎，就請他們試乘新機。六人一組，每次八分鐘，共飛五次，代表的太太，小姐也盛裝夾雜其間。我們乘這空閒時間，便渡江，乘人力車環遊全城。十一時，復從溫州，直向福州進飛，預定十二時半就可到達。飛至十一時四十分，遠遠看到羣山頂上的白雲忽然加厚起來，一刹那時，白雲降到山腰，半山就迷糊不明。有數朶白雲，向飛機迎頭飛來，愈來愈多，最後竟是週圍一片白色，分不出底下是海是山，更分不出東西南北的方向。我的心突然加速的跳躍起來，各人的面部不期然的都表現出驚慌的顔色。同時無綫電收到從廣州北上飛機也遇霧折回的消息，戴先生將電文給我們傳觀一過，狠鎭靜的道，我們還是先回溫州去吃飯吧。我們面面相覻，不發一言，飛機師即駕機掉頭，飛向回程，四面包圍白雲始漸漸稀薄，二十分鐘张，完全衝出重霧，回復清朗山河</p>
<p>十二時半重到溫州。我們一行還有一绕希望，就是等候福州的天氣報告，如重霧退去，就可繼續飛行。等到下午一時，福州的天氣報告來了，結果却是情况愈惡，於是咸抱着失望的神態，一時悄然登機，折返上海。</p>
<p>事後據飛機師房斯君道，今天的霧還是輕霧，因爲白雲的片數不大，中間有許多漏縫，尙可看清地面的景色，本可冒險衝去，飛抵福州，但是爲愼重起見，不得不折回了。又道，飛機最怕霧，暴風雨次之，中國對飛航設備狠不完全，如有沿海岸無綫電臺在重霧等時，隨時報告應飛航角度，那就盲目亦可飛行，安全萬分了。（完）</p>
<h3>曉起就園居散步作</h3>
<p>— 庚白</p>
<p>隣鷄破夢角聲哀，起就圍居藉綠苔，薄瞑端爲朝氣地，寒花時送暗香來，一樓憂樂先天下，羣動升沈盡不才，猶有探囊餘智在，奮飛試與掣風雷！</p>
<h3>子樓之冬</h3>
<p>— 林庚白</p>
<p>冬已經悄悄走進了我的小樓了。獨自坐在寫字臺面前，拿着一枝筆，攤着紙，凝望窗外，無量數憤世嫉俗的情緒，燃起了我這創傷賸餘下來的心。我要憧憬未來，不能不打破現實，更不能不忘却過去。改造新社會的使命，把我從愛的痛苦，和生的糾紛中，解放了出來，給予我一種新鮮的力，這該是多麽個慰安啊？</p>
<p>但是可愛的女郎，不斷的閃動在我的眼中，我想閉着眼睛，黑暗中的光明不容許我，因爲儘管合了眼，好像是總有一個離不開的幻象，在我的腦際撩繞着，眼膜裏的圈子，也總是離不開這一個朦朧的影，怎麽辦呢？我依然忘不了過去嗎？我懷疑。</p>
<p>牆角的許多落葉，由枯綠漸禄成了焦黄，這是象徵着冷酷無情的冬；在伸張他的權威，使人們感到生之幻滅，跟着一切的幻滅。同時猩紅色的繡花簾子裏，也會漾着微瀭的陽光，使人覺着美麗而明媚，這不又是告訴人們以冬雖已佈滿了大地，而和煦之眷，也就在醞釀着來年的新生了吧？改造新社會的使命，閃動着的可愛的女郎，那一樣是春之縮影呢？動股而矛盾的幻想，使我慰安，也更使我迷惘。</p>
<p>没有痛苦，不能産生愉快，没有糾紛，不能促成整齊，没有矛盾，不能發現統一，那末這迷惘，也許就是我最後的慰安的起點吧？這第一個，第二個，第三個，第四個，以至於許許多多個的迷惘，到了最後的一幕中，它會像一朶朶的浮雲般，烘托出蔚藍的天來。</p>
<p>我興奮了。我計算着日程，今天是星期五，　明天是星期六，後天是星期。下一個星期一起，我無論怎樣懶和煩，我必須改變生活，要準備着應做的事，要循着應走的途徑去，每一天一刻一秒鐘，都該很規則的課着自已，因爲我很明瞭我的個性，是需要着刺激，和督促的，這麽一轉念間，可愛的女郎的影，又閃動着了</p>
<p>智識階級終是要持續他生活水準的，這是現代的資本主義社會，形成他們的意識，情緒，任何人都不能例外，除非這世界的經濟制度，來一個根本的變革。我很憐憫大人先生們，連這一點點，也不認識，只是嚷着固有的文化，拚命地向開倒車的岔道奔，竟會想不到目前的中國社會，一切的生活，已整個換了樣，至少是都市的社會這樣，這很明顯地受着國際經濟制度的影響。所以在中國人，一般的生活反映之下，在中國的農業經濟到工業經濟的轉換期中，要改造一個新的社會，只有唯一的能够創設獨特的新經濟制度才可以。不然就得重新回復了舊的生活，和物質文明不曾侵入中國以前的經濟制度，使社會同化，也還一貫而或者有可有性，但誰又能否認這是滑稽呢？我想起改造新社會來，我又不能不抖擻着邁往無前的勇氣。</p>
<p>眼前畢竟還是個冬，我期待着春天，　我躱在小樓的一角，嚷着春天快要到來了，但我該怎樣來過這一個冬，我不能空白地嚷着算。譬如栽一顆樹，也要撒下了種子，殷勤地灌漑，使得它萌芽起來，使得它到了春天，才能够從萌芽中長成枝葉，從枝葉再怒放着蓓蕾的花。我想着好笑起來了。假若我是一棵樹，我幻想中的新生，就是這最後爛熳的花朶了但花朶不僅是需要灌漑，也同樣需要着雨露的滋潤，陽光的沐浴。我自已對於前路的努力，只不外灌漑的功用，女郎啊！你要像雨露和陽光般的賜予，使得這欣欣向榮的樹，有開放這新社會之花的一天，那時眼前的冷醒，自然要被溫暖的春都給帶走了。我寫完這一篇小品後，似乎希望之神已在招手，我忘了冷酷，忘了一切的冷酷</p>

<p>「待到皇帝們在這宫殿上休息了了回之後，他們的精神已經是完全充實了，而他的從人也在同時把應用的弓馬統統預備下了，于是他就站起身來，整整衣服，復迅速地跨上了馬背，一直馳向曠塲中去。這時那些管虎豹的人已得到了暗示，便把木籠打開，讓那野獸衝出來；同時還有許多的人，在旁邊高聲呐喊，或用長槍大戟去撩撥它，務必使它受驚，或激起它的怒來。這些野獸最先必然是没命的逃進林子中去，待它一進了林子，那些人一個個都穿着很鮮艷的獵裝，並帶着完備的武器。一便分頭趕進去，驅逐它出林。他們却並不和那野獸直接接戰，祗是用燃旺的爆竹丢將進去，乒乒乓乓的擾得野獸不敢再在林子中存身，便奮勇跳出了林來，正好就在那皇帝守候着的面；這樣，就得有三支箭連續的打那皇帝的弓上發射出來，如果這三支箭竟能悉數的射中，那野獸是死定的了，而這位皇帝的箭法，便從此可以博得精熟的美譽了！假使三箭之中，只中了一箭或兩箭，也算是很好的了：因爲比較硬些的弓上所發出來的箭，往往只須一箭便可以把一頭老虎或豹子射死：不過也有一箭，或兩箭，甚至三箭還射不死它的時候，那末這個皇帝就得不顧了一切的危險，拔出劍來，衝上前去，務必將它殺死，然後可以歇手。」（二二○）</p>

<h3>直綫式刻度盤的製法</h3>
<p>— 汪盛世</p>
<p>現在歐洲的收音機有許多都採用直綫式刻度盤，式樣新頴而美觀，可是構造却很簡單、下面是一個仿製的方法，材料極便宜，祗要略費功夫，卽可做成。</p>
<p>先預備馬糞紙一小張，五耗厚木板一小塊，直徑約八耗長約一糎的玻璃管（或竹筆管）二段，皮鞋帶一根，一糎半長的小洋釘數隻，東西預備後，照下面的方法去做。</p>
<p>這法各式的收音機都可以用，但爲简單起見，假設爲二木板做成的直流機。原來的電容器大都裝於面板中間，現在先要把他改造一下。把預備好的木板切下高六糎寛三糎的一塊，用釘釘住在底板的中間，離面板一糎。在這小木板中間四糎高處鑽一孔，在面板上同樣位置也鑽一孔，那末若將電容器固定在小板時，他的旋軸就可以伸出面板的外面。</p>
<p>在預備的木板上另畫一直徑六糎之圓圈，用銅絲鋸仔細鋸下，四週用礎刀磨光，在中心鑽一孔，直徑約六耗，比電容器旋軸直徑略小。再把馬糞紙剪成直徑七糎的圓板二個，中間也割成一大孔，用膠水黏於圓板的兩面，使四週都露出五耗。（圖二）</p>
<p>再看（圖三），就是刻度盤的大概。照圖在面板上將尺寸畫好，Ｃ孔卽爲安放電容器旋軸處，虚綫卽小木板，上面有黑綫的方塊須刻去，這步工作須留意，因關係全部美觀也。在面板後ＡＢ二點，釘二小洋釘，洋釘上套二小段玻璃管（或竹筆管），可自由旋轉，但因被釘頭擋住，故不能滑出。　　　此時可將電容器裝上。先把旋軸由後面套入小木板之孔，再拿圓木板用力套於軸上，然後把電容器固定在小木板上。軸的一部分伸出在面板的外面，如（圖四），可用一小旋鈕固定其上。圓木板必須緊套在軸上，不能使其滑動。</p>
<p>再用一寛約四耗的皮鞋帶，如圖三緊裹於圓木反，再由ＡＢ繞至上面。將帶之二端拉緊，另用一小銅片剪成（圖五）形，沿虚綫折轉，套於帶的接頭處，用鉗子夾緊，剪去帶的端尾，這帶就接得很牢固了。另以長二糎的二十六號銅絲一段，將其頭敲扁，另一頭銲在接頭的銅片上，做成指針。這時將電容器轉動，指針卽在方孔内移動。</p>
<p>再取一名片式的白紙，剪成尺寸如圖六，依虚綫折轉，黏於面板方孔的後面，如圖三虚綫。此白紙上可畫許多直綫，表示電台的週率。</p>
<p>先將電容器定動片密合使不動，用手把帶拉動，使指針位於方孔之極左Ａ處，則電容器漸漸轉出時，指針漸漸移向右邊。現在可以收聽各電台，在指針所指地位記下其週率，連聽數十處，卽可將白紙上週率（或波長）的位置完全劃出。各事完畢後，可在方孔外面釘一雲母片，以避灰塵。</p>
<p>這盤的尺寸可隨意增减，但方孔的長度必須較圓木反圓周的一半略長。普通收音機都裝在木盒内，故此盤材料雖賤，但裝好後，外面却很美觀，放在案頭，誰不要稱讚一聲呢。</p>

<p>初步短波播音機</p>
<p>此機構造簡單；製造容易，凡曾做過一二隻收音機的，大概就不至於失敗。這裏所用的眞空管是三十一號，雖然電力極小，可是靠了短波的神奇，却也有數百華里的射程呢。因爲要構造簡單，所以採用了栅極調幅，據實騐結果，尙稱不差。同志中如玩厭了廣播收音機的，那末不妨照此綫路來試試播音。</p>
<p>另件表</p>
<p>Ｌ　用空心柴銅管（汽油燈店有售），在三吋徑圓筒上繞六圈。繞好後由筒上脱下，用手拉長，使每圈距離與綫之粗細相等。</p>

<p>全機裝竣，卽可較騐。先將ＡＢ電接上，將夾子夾在近栅極四五圈處。另用十六號紫銅綫繞或三吋直徑的環一個，二頭接一小電珠。將此小電珠放近Ｌr至小電珠發光。如不發光，可將夾子移上或移下，直至發光爲止。如此則眞空管已發生振盪。然後用一波長表放在八十公尺段，旋轉Ｃr使小電珠發光。此時波長已凖，乃可接上天地綫，旋轉C，如果振盪良好則小電珠亦能發光。如不能發光。則可用一收音機在一二丈外收聽，旋轉Ｃ，使收音機中收到的音最清晰響亮爲度。</p>
<h3>强力眞空管用作檢波的改良</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>强力眞空管之所司工作，大致皆使</p>
<p>有於未級作强力低週率擴大，（PowerAmplitier）如２　５，３３，３９，４１，４２，４３４７等之五極强力眞空管，因其屏極間輸出係數强大的緣故，故採用以增其未級有强大音量之輸出，倘以普通眞空管作兩級低週率擴大，不如改用一級强力低週率擴大，而其輸出之音量亦綽綽有餘，因之此種眞空管頗受業餘研究界之熱烈歡迎。但在異想天開的業餘研究者邇來皆以强力眞空管作檢波，而在各報章以及無綫電雜誌亦紛紛刊載關於强力檢波的綫路圖，雖然成績確爲優越，可是有一利亦必有一弊也。</p>
<p>强力眞空管用作檢波雖然成績可超出任何眞空管，但是音調失眞以及回授力不平穏，就是牠的缺點，作者爲好奇心所驅使，以五極强力眞空管檢波作一具回授式單管機，試騐結果，皆不出余之所料，後經數次研究，方始發覺强力眞空管内通乙電正極之簾栅極，係助以吸收電子而加强屏極係數之輸出者。用作檢波回投力之不平穏，想係簾栅電壓太高所致，故卽改照四極簾栅檢波眞空管之裝置法，結果成績之優良，出於意外，至於所改良之處，則不過在簾栅極加兩枚電阻而已，綫路見圖，同病相憐的讀者，不妨照圖加裝一下。</p>
<h3>使用銾氣整流管時應注意的幾點</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>現在通行的整流眞空管有二種一種是眞空式，一種是銾氣式（MercuRyＶapor　Rectifier）效力則後者勝於前者，因爲銾氣整流管的電壓降甚小，普通約爲十五伏脱，且這降壓並不隨荷負的大小而有變動的。換句話説就是用銾氣整流管可以輸出較大的電壓，而且穏定。但在使用時亦應加以相當的注意。今略述如下：</p>
<p>（一）輸出電流不可過負　每一銾氣整流管皆有一規定的最大輸出電流（Maxim　　　D.C.Outnpt）。使用時若較此數　出，小則促短壽命，大則可以　損於俄頃　有人在檢騐收音機時，常喜以旋鑿使Ｂ十Ｂ一短路，以試有否Ｂ電壓有在。此種方法施之眞空式整流管尙無大礙，但在銾氣式時，可以在一舉手之間使之成爲廢物，應絶對避免。</p>
<p>（二）燈絲電壓須照規定　銾氣整流管之燈絲電壓，須完全依照規定數目。較高當然有礙，較低亦足使其燈絲衰老。所以在設計其供給燈絲之變壓器時，應特别留意。而燈絲電壓亦應量其燈脚上者，不可量變壓器上者；因整流管之燈絲電流大多甚大，其在導綫上之電壓降當然亦大，不可忽視也。同時其燈座亦應採取接觸特别改良好者，</p>
<p>（三）銾氣整流管擱置多日後；在復用前，應先將燈絲燃點約二十秒鐘，以蒸發其上所凝附之銾粒，方可接其屏壓使用。</p>
<p>（四）若被整流的電流電壓甚高·則燈絲電流應先通約半分鐘。否則若在燈絲未燃熱以前，驟施高電壓於其屏上燈絲將無力應付而告損壞也。</p>
<p>（五）　電壓峯不可超出規定　每一銾氣　流管　有一規定之「最大負電壓峯」（Max.loverse　Peak　Voltant）（卽在整流時，屏極與陰極間電流不通的一瞬間，二者之間所能耐受之最大電壓。）使用時不可超過此數。（卽高壓綫圈電壓的一·四倍、不可大於此規定數。）例如八二號銾氣整流管的最大負電壓峯爲一千四百弗打，若用作每屏二百五十弗打之全波整流，則高壓綫圈電壓的一·四倍爲七百弗打。此數小於規定之最大負電峯，故知使用時並無危險。</p>
<p>亦銾氣整流管應裝置於通風之處，以免溫度過於增高而生危險，或損壞其他零件。</p>
<h3>小經騐</h3>
<p>— 蔡日新</p>
<p>當你做好了一隻收音機，在未揷眞空管之前，必須先把綫路校對一下，最要注意的地方，就是乙電正極的電路，[I</p>
<h3>單管的多管的</h3>
<p>切不可與絲極的綫直接相連接，接錯了，幾塊錢一隻的眞空管，一　那間就化爲烏有；普通乙電正極所經過的路，大都如圖一圖二，只要屏電不走錯，眞空管就决不會燒去。</p>
<p>檢查後若是還不放心，那你可以把電阻開着，甲乙二電池接上，聽筒的一脚揷入燈座絲極Ｆ的一洞中，另一脚用手拿着，輕輕的接觸絲極的另一洞（須碰着洞中的彈簧或角上的接綫柱，這時聽筒中就有卜落卜落的聲音，這聲音與平時用聽筒的二脚去接觸甲電的二極的聲音一樣，就是表示接綫没有錯誤，可把眞空管揷上去；若是卜落的聲音很巨大，超過平常四五倍，這表示乙電已走入絲極，切不可把管揷上，須再檢查綫路，</p>

<h3>保護膜片法</h3>
<p>— 阿鳳</p>
<p>普通無綫電的收音機，聽筒是必要的東西，但因套在耳上聽得過久了，以致耳内的熱氣蒸發，聰筒膜片上發生蒸氣水點，一般人每每歡喜揩去，因之膜片上的黑漆也聯帶的揩掉了，遂致日久生銹，减輕收音效力，非特那膜片重換新的不可，這不是很麻煩麽？現經試騐所得略述保護法於下。</p>
<p>先查看膜片有無生銹，若是完好的，只須用軟布輕輕揩去膜片上的齷齪，再找二張普通包香烟的錫紙，照着聽筒膜片的大小剪好，分置於每一聽筒膜片之上，（錫紙須平而無小洞者才適用），這樣雖有蒸氣水發現，亦不致損及膜片</p>
<p>假使膜片已經生銹，那只要用最細的砂皮，輕輕擦去鐵銹，再用汽油洗凈齷齪，仍按照前法用錫紙裝好，則發出的聲音，必與新的時候一樣響。</p>
<p>國外消息</p>
<h3>電視的進步</h3>
<p>— 王輔民譯</p>
<p>電視（Television）在中國好像還生疏，但在外國差不多已經很普遍了，尤其在德國進步特别的快，最近在德國無綫電展覽會陳列的Lowe電視收影機，已經可算發明到很圓滿的地步，此機不但能收活動的影像，並且同時還能收音。該機的分點板（Scanning）每寸高至一百八十綫（Line），故所收的影甚爲清楚。發射電視機的波長爲6.92m或４２９００ＫＣ，將來或許能用到１cm.到１m。</p>
<p>這幾月來德國Reichspost　與Reichs　Broadcasting　Co。連絡舉行幾種户外攝去電視的質騐，他們設計造了一種電視攝取汽車（Television　Pick-up　car），在此汽車内攝取有聲電影片，可在一分鐘内完成顯影，定影，冲洗·曬乾四件事。眞是一件驚人的事情。</p>
<p>今將此工作程序述之如下：最初以有聲電影機攝取外景，次在一分鐘内完成顯影，定影，冲洗，曬乾四部工作，再經過一有聲電影放映機，此機之前，具有Nikhow　的分點板（Scanning　disc）與一光電池（Photo-cell）。影片經過這一部時，卽被分點板上的許多小孔轉成光點，再照至光電管而變爲電流，輸入一種八九級靈敏的高週率放大機，再調和到短波發射中發射出去。</p>
<p>至於收影機在德國可分二種：第一種爲家用的，幕（Screen）祗有八寸高十寸闊，第二種爲公衆戲園用的，幕大至八尺高十二尺闊·家用電視機用的顯影管爲Cathode　ray或Ｂraun管。</p>

<h3>一星期來之洋拆逐步鬆落三角强</h3>
<p>今年自開關以來、銀錢兩業、因鑒於陰歷年關總結束期伊邇、不肯作大規模之放欵舉動、故市氣雖逐漸鬆和、而實際社會上緊促、較平時爲尤甚、因而各商業困苦、爲任何時期所不如、此次銀根雖次第回復、究以市氣不佳、終覺無從發展耳、市塲中洋拆、早午兩市同爲二角三分、較前日改小五分、劃頭加水八九分、拆票交易、早市轉賬二百二十餘萬、新交易六十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易五十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖四十餘萬、新做出八十餘萬、鈔票收回五十餘萬、發出七十餘萬、又暗記券三十餘萬　客路來源十萬、去胃廿五萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵二百二十餘萬、各種貨滙押墊雜欵收解三百九十餘萬、外滙結欵八十餘萬、特滙欵六十餘萬、電滙欵四十餘萬、進倉四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵二百八九十萬、各種貨匯税雜諸欵收解四百三四十萬、電滙欵七十餘萬、特匯欵六十餘萬、外匯結價欵一百二十餘萬、出倉六十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百五十餘萬、各種貨匯雜欵收解三百三十餘萬、外滙結價欵七十餘萬、特滙欵六十餘萬、電滙欵三十餘萬、出倉四十萬、錢莊洋公單收解二千九百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百三十餘萬、各路匯欵四十餘萬、收現五六十萬、又票據交換所十一日交換總數、銀元七百九十八萬五千三百五十一元一角七分、内計銀元四百九十四萬一千三百六十九元八角七分、滙劃銀元三百零四萬三千九百八十一元三角、公單拆欵息每千元每日一角二分、公單貼現率每千元每日二角三分、</p>

<h3>證劵債市不脱盤旋局面</h3>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市面愈形由盤旋而趨於呆滯、洋拆逐步趨鬆、人心毫不興奮、二千萬元不久到申、多頭并不踴躍、套利交易、依然不起、此中癓結、完全因籌碼擁擠之故、大户空頭不補而陸績尙有加碼、散户套利交易、至今未見掉期、散多大空、壁疊甚堅、據一班人預測、大户空頭、雖不致全數交貨、但其預備交貨者、數必甚鉅、市價盤旋過久、殊非多頭之福、因洋拆大跌、而市價不漲、萬一洋拆回高、則市價必跌無疑、銀根明鬆暗緊、各業均將收縮、因無法活動而倒閉者、日有所聞、債市在此陰歷年關逼近時、受各業不景氣之影響、前途尙不易振作、目下因洋拆鬆退、環境良好、多頭尙安定、市價或尙須盤旋也、昨日經過、大都疲憊無神、上午開收兩盤、每盤皆疲落二三角、七十八號賣出較多、十六及五十三號均有賣出、　惟均不踴躍、惟市價疲而不跌、午後劃頭像九分、市價依然振作不起、開盤前列仍略堅穏、後列仍趨疲象、略小一角左右、收盤祗裁兵略堅、餘仍小一角左右、市價或將先小後高、昨日結果、一致疲落五分一角至三角半、成交總數、計共祗八百十九萬一千元、兹將其漲跌結果、列比較有於左（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紐約股市閑散之由來</h3>
<p>日本海外債市已呈軟化</p>
<p>新豐洋行報告昨（十日）紐約股市、閑散而平、商業消息雖屬順利、但交易者對市面之前途無從斷定、多呈觀望、以待趨勢之較形明確、再交易者對本週内價格之行動、亦頗不滿、蓋彼等原期市况上升也、若干方面料上漲前尙將繼續跌落、惟無人信市面之將一蹶不振也、目下股市之不振、其原因中最重要者厥惟（一）最高法院煤油判决之影響、仍留在市面、（二）金條文將來結果之難測日本因財政困難、其公債在倫敦之市况已呈軟化、此間交易者聞此頗予注意、債市趨漲、小交易所情形穏定、芝加哥小麥微升、全日成交七十八萬股、兹將道瓊斯紐約指數列左、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗僅三四角起伏</h3>
<p>紗市平淡無奇、升降範圍祗在三·四·角之間、但通濟通成之多額、按住不動、空頭視金融緊急、亦不抵補、於是市盤遂成　局矣、</p>
<h3>金鷄市象蕭條</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉又跌五磅音、金市平定、但塲中市氣仍屬蕭索、交易甚稀、多空大户、均袖手不動、散户因陰歷年關日近、均無章營業因之交易停頓、各月漲跌一·二·角、午後聞現紗客銷呆滯、人氣仍散、各月均跌一·二·四·五角、查賣出德記九百包、潤康四百五十包、愼益三百包、益昶二百包、明德二百包、買進大孚三百五十包、錦昌六百五十包、源大二百五十包、長　三百包、一日開最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花市况愈加靜止</h3>
<p>棉市仍在盤旋中、形勢十分暗澹、美棉亦稍回落、印棉漲跌互界、多空太户、毫無動靜、廠方因紗市不振、辦現不旺、故人心看低、不過印棉比價較昂云、</p>
<h3>鄭標買賣兩寂</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、市仍無甚變動、印棉粗貨漲○五至二羅半、細絨貨跌半羅比、金價稍漲、然市仍寂寞、各月均跌五分至一角、午後開盤稍昂、長和抵空、拍至二三盤、紗市平澹、長豐了結二千九百擔、市况略轉鬆懈、結果近漲五分、遠平、查費出長豐四千三百擔、潤康一千七百擔、愼記二千一百擔、賡豐六百擔、永昌七百擔、買進恒益七百擔、生源七百擔、穗隆　　擔、源大六百擔、元德　百擔、　　二千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉先漲後跌終穏定</h3>
<p>昨紐約美棉市况堅定而不活潑、雙方等待華盛頓發展、故市價上落甚微、晨初開盤、因利物浦消息良好、國内外同業買進、各月漲一至三磅音、旋因多頭了結、南方及紐奥倫賣出、即行回軟、據報一角借欵棉花有二十萬包、將於三月十五日出清、然市况未受影響、蓋衆意或將變爲一角二分借欵也、收盤市况穏定、計現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌一至三磅音、尾月漲一磅音、英棉市况參差、現貨跌五點、期貨跌一點、印棉期貨商買進、套頭賣出及多頭了結、計平果爾漲二·二五羅比、奥姆辣跌二羅比、白羅溪跌半羅比、原電録左、（九日電）</p>

<h3>紗交倉庫存紗减縮</h3>
<p>華商紗布交易所倉庫中存紗量、至一月十日截止、統計一萬五千一百五十五包、内中仍以二十支富貴紗七千三百包爲最多、其次二十支人鐘紗四千一百廿包、其他多屬零星、兹將包額及紗名録下、（單位包）</p>

<h3>糧食行家又有洋麥套出</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平穏之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥微小四分至一角零、坎拿大互有四分上落、　開價時、以業外浮空、微有抵補、因此喊價上落甚少、較之前日、一無出入、迨至下午開盤、初尙平靜、旋因行家又有洋麥套售、故交易雖稀、人心則漸軟弱、結果本月份較小三分、二月份不動、三月份小二分、四月份不動、現麥市面、尙呈穏固、以廠胃微貪、喊價穏住、開歸德麥四元零三四分、宿州麥四元零三分、瑶灣麥四元、大利集麥四元零一分計二萬包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、謡傳加拿大政府不准五月份空頭掉問至七月份、農村在貨計一萬三千六百零四萬四千斛、適如一般人之所料、玉蜀黍農村存貨計八萬一千四百零一萬七千斛、較預料者略高、</p>

<h3>期粉買賣各求結束</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥微小四分至一角二分、坎拿大互有四分出入、當開價時、因業内外之買賣、均以舊曆結賬之故、逐步收結、買賣一少、市面遂無十分上落、上午各盤、市價均與前日相仿、迨至下午開盤、本月份因實銷見停、形勢見疲、遠期因廠家不套、現洋麥喊價微昂、人心轉定、六月份新貨好起一分外、結果一二月份較小二厘半、三月份不動、四五月份好二厘半、产六月份好一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>河下米來源仍旺</h3>
<p>（滬南）　昨各帮來源忽又轉旺、共到五十餘號、（貨共九千餘石）、因之疲憊市况、猶難振作、大時復轉陰、但銷塲不爽、形勢乃復清寂、如各厚粳價步跌角半、而晚稻幸有客帮動辦二三百包、故紙修數分至角　、杜洋尖則以來源又絶、復無市、陰變元去路不廣、致亦下疲角許、（滬北）　咋日河下和地來源二十餘號、市上各貨消胃、白粳高中貨略有交易、中次呆細、薄稻殺價稍化、餘貨均甚清淡、市價白粳高料小數分至一有、中次小角外、薄稻小二三角、羊杜尖疲幾分、變陰元小一二角、埠客尖堅定、</p>
<h3>洋客秈每况愈下</h3>
<p>各檔續小三五分至一角</p>
<p>期貨囤户求出更見無神</p>
<p>昨洋米市况、因存底充足、到頭不絶、額囤紛紛貶價脱手、市乃步步趨下、軟弱無神、現貨續跌五六分至角許、中次别價認眞、實因市上供過於求、進户趁機撳壓也、價小後由本街内地辦去四十多包、期米被囤户貶價、尤形一蹶不振之局、昨已降小五分至一角、然囤户尙願貶價脱手、　洋行新交易已爲停頓、回籠貨開出八百噸、客秈亦被洋米帶小、幸市上存到兩少、産價高昂、故祗帶小三五分、全市由本街内地去四千五百包、</p>
<h3>黄豆廠銷突然暢達</h3>
<p>昨日黄豆市况、本承上日之疲風而見軟勢、但油廠家辦胃突健、致人心穏定、蓋因廠方見來貨不湧、底積日少、油價堅穏、餅銷尙活、且昨清晨有大昌新油廠廠房祝融肆虐、致出品少一家、故有家加緊工作、所以需豆勁接、計廠方辦去歸德豆五千六百餘包、價爲三元七角五分至七角二分、又大連四平街豆二十五六車、價爲四元、内城本街等採去漢口乍豆二千餘包、大連西城豆一百餘包、潁州陳豆二百餘包、漢口遞豆二百包、漢溝豆三十包、</p>
<h3>糖市糖價均見上漲</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、粗砂白平定無上落、其餘本廠白及潮啻等均見　升、趨勢堅穏、公會划盤、二四粗砂白現貨普通十九元、轉口貨五元四角、均無上落八九號荷赤呌十三元九角、未成太古糖Ｂ嘜仍十九元三角、本廠綿白振裕一號十八元三角、二號十八元一角、三號十七元九角半、四號十七元八角半、均升一角、號盤有建帮開出泉州片青三百餘件、價爲十元、興化帮開出興化片青數十件、十元、廣帮開出石門片青百餘件、十元、潮帮續開潮青一千餘包、黄崗青爲十元七角至六角</p>
<p>、半南青十元○四角、隆港青十元○二角至十元、比前又升一二角、海南赤由方萃和開百餘包、十二元四角、大隆開七十餘包、十二元五角、</p>
<h3>南北貨蘭花子竟有缺貨説</h3>
<p>蘭花子、近以來源稀少、行存手貨漸告單薄且據天津函訊、存底亦已售罄、後市有看升一二元之説、故此間銷路頓見活動、但全黄好貨至爲缺乏、不得已而求其次、因此普通莊漲起半元、號貨亦將斷檔、</p>
<h3>五金會司鐵英貨斷檔</h3>
<p>會司鐵市况、現因烟公司作大箱子之用　故搜辦甚健、致多日積存之現貨、頗有被購殆盡之勢、行情方面、因之步高、計英貨每二百磅估二十七元、美貨估二十九元、但英貨因貨質便宜、所以購者反多、致流通市上之現貨、已有斷檔之概、　聞連日成交共達四五百箱（每箱二百磅）之多、惟繼續收辦者仍甚踴躍、惟英貨軋缺、致購户勢不得不買美貨、故連日美貨市面、頗呈良好、是以行情一層、似有再好之望、</p>
<h3>純銻價最成交乃稀</h3>
<p>湖南常寗水口山之純銻、因物質優良、製造鎗彈及其他軍用品鉛字等用途、頗爲廣大、况各國（除俄國外）莫不需用於此、以此每年出口數頗可觀、惟近來因輸運困難、及産貨鮮少之影響、是以行情飛漲、每噸高至八百五十元、而交易一項、因販户難於出手、所以反覺冷落、聞連日開出祗有少數、</p>
<h3>絲茶絲價有上漲可能</h3>
<p>滬錫存　絲一萬三千繭一萬六千擔</p>
<p>本星期絲市、日前因路透社報告花旗市情、誤報高漲一角、因此滬埠用户及囤户之進胃、更爲興奮、市價因之高抬、翌日雖經證明、奈申市陳絲有限、（據調查所得、上海及無錫陳絲尙有一萬三千擔、繭子一萬六千擔左右、此數只足供用户之需求）、故市價迄未稍弱、里昂方面、日來亦不寂寞、據個中人語、絲市尙有繼續高漲之可能云、</p>

<h3>作爲印象主義者的契訶夫</h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>作爲八十一九十年代的俄國平民智識份子之鏡的契訶夫，正生活在這麽一個混亂的時人。一方面是貴族社會生活的漸急劇崩壞，男一方面是資産階級的逐抬頭。然而在這時候資本主義的發展還是處於原始的積壘的形態，還不曾成熟到足以使資産階級意識到自已的歷史任務的時候，另一方面在地主官僚沙皇政府壓迫之下，以知識份子的民粹派和民意社倡導的革命又失敗了，於是在這種急劇的轉變期中，一般知識份子便徬徨，迷亂起來，「不能攫住生活的意識，不能克服生活的混亂，」因而結局不得不在托爾斯泰主義中得到他們底精神的自我麻醉；愛好「小事件」的清談，把自己底生活局限於最細微的物質生活的關心上，以一種不聯貫的，無意義的瞎扯來充實他們的生活。他們缺乏一種堅實的意志，易受感動，神經衰弱，「時而涕泗縱横，時而仰天大笑。」他們感到自己底生活是「苦惱的，盲目的，航髒的，」他們也希望從這種不可忍受的陰暗，卑俗中解放出來，希望得看到幸福的幻影，他們却又不願突然的變動——這會擾亂了他們底生活的均衡－因而他們唯一解脱的方法，便是悄悄地死去。</p>
<p>他們感覺到「生活底彩衣已經褪色了，只留下些暗淡的雜色班跡。」他們美麗地幻想着三百年後的生活的美滿，然而他們却也從不曾想到「誰都在這麽地希望着，那麽呌誰去實現呢？」</p>
<p>神經衰弱，易受感動，缺乏一種體系化的思想和宇宙觀，對於現實底不理解，這正是八十年代俄國智識份子底特徵。在這一個動亂的時代里，他們缺乏着一種體系的固定的思想去分析，綜合客觀的現實，而只能消極地片斷地攝取牠的印象，在這種氛圍里面，作爲他們中的一人之契訶夫，就産生了他的印象主義的風格。</p>
<p>盧那却爾斯基在「我們應該批判契訶夫」一文中説道：</p>
<p>「契訶夫的性情很軟弱，正和一般藝術家一樣，但他是一個寫實主義者，他的鋭敏的眼睛，不斷地凝視着他的週遭，帶着殉道者貪慾的神氣，想抓住一切的現實，但是複雜的相互錯綜的現　生活，必須要不斷的鋭敏的觀察和十分正確的表現，契訶夫做到了這一點……他所生的時代的現實生活是用最　的速度向前急流着，契訶夫對於他的作品不自覺地採用了小品的和短篇小説的體裁，就連他的戲劇也帶着着着這種特徵。他對於複雜印象的描寫方法不是攏統的，整體的，而是各個環節組成的不間斷的連鎖。……印象主義者的情感是離數的，游移的，他的脈搏跳動得很快，帶有神經質和女性的易感，——一切這些特徵。便是契訶夫風格最眞切和最顯著獨特的地方，也正因爲這些特徵，使契訶夫在文藝上走向新的軌道和形式。」</p>
<p>契訶夫底印象主義的風格，也正和八十年代的俄國知識份子之一般的特質一樣，是具有其社會的根據的。爲了缺少一種體系化的思想，——這在契訶夫底思想底變化底歷程本身可以看出來——和對於客觀現實整體的認識的能力，契訶夫——正和八十年代的俄國知識份子一樣，不能够在整體的複雜性上，其本質其動向上去認識客觀的現實，不能够把自已所感受的生活印象，經過觀察的冶鐵爐的鎔鑄有系統地綜合地製造成一幅整體的社會生活底圖畫，而只能够片斷地攝取牠——這一點，也正决定了契訶夫底作品的形式——短篇小説。</p>
<p>然而體現於契訶夫的短篇小説中的現實，决不是從現實底整體割裂開來的東西，而乃是「溶解了整體的印象的，」整體底斷片。契訶夫底短篇小説，「正像有力的磁石和攝影的底片，生活的片斷經過牠而聚集而凝結起來。契訶夫底好些短篇小説和小品，都富有一種抒情詩——雖然這種抒情詩常是憂鬱的，而且浮漾着一種低微的輕蔑和冷笑（不是一種舒適的冷嘲，或是「你看，多寒傖！」那種紳士氣的鄙夷，寗乃是一種由於同情和憐愛而來的没奈何的輕蔑和冷笑）的音響的——的風味，也正是作爲這個印象主義者底風格底特徵之一形態而呈現出來的東西。</p>
<h3>夜雪</h3>
<p>— 楊偁</p>
<p>哨子的顫音，在墨灰的天空斷續地響着。三五成羣的鴿子，馱着夕陽的逝影，向光秃的权枒廻旋一轉，又分散開去。</p>
<p>天早就是沉昏的，不到五點却迷离地黑下來。稀零路燈的胡同，黑冥冥的浸染在一片昏黄裏。陰森森的夜色，一直如潮水似的蔓延過去，鬱結着夜的沉寂。</p>
<p>遠遠的那邊風的騷音漸漸大起來。捲挾了黄沙，呼號着刮過來，衝起滿天的烟幕，可又是汹汹的奔越開去了。</p>
<p>雪是一點一滴的飄下來，斜斜的飛，飛到瓦面，杈枒，黑色的胡同巷。</p>
<p>小販的尖免呌賣聲，突然覺得悽慘起來，這麽凄清的，像是呌號出生的苦痛似的，一聲聲給吞没於風的狂吼裏。那寂寞的身影，彎着腰，一斜一拐的，走過去。任由雪花堆積在肩頭，帽的邊緣，又跌落來。可是仍然沉着地慢慢地走。</p>
<p>棉車蓬的車，丁東的一聲，飛跑過去。車夫吐着霧氣，一上一下的喘氣，明亮的煤汽燈，突破周曹的昏暗，地面的冰骨獰笑似的，露着慘白的臉。</p>
<p>一輪藍陰陰的下弦月，開始流瀉「她」昏薄的光，雪已經積滿着屋頂了。互相地映照着，却變成純白的世界，一切黑暗的地方，給蒙在白的掩飾中。</p>
<p>低矮的人家屋頂在雪下柔順地點伏着。古舊的大門外，懶狗已是躱起來。白色的胡同巷，長蛇般伸展過去，　向前曲折着，給没入墻角了。</p>
<p>寂靜慘白，統治了這城市。行人把頭恨不得縮進圍巾裏，嘘了一口長氣，立刻面前起一片烟霧。冰骨會在鼻孔凝結，耳凍得掉下去似的失了知覺。到了這時，就會想着南方，想到暖和來安慰自已。</p>
<h3>冬</h3>
<p>— －Gcorge　Wright作</p>
<h3>一夫一妻</h3>
<p>— 陳福熙</p>
<p>小孩子　　　　　　　　　抱抱呀，抱抱呀，………」</p>
<p>這聲音時常刺着魏雪生的耳膜。</p>
<p>魏雪生從公司的辦事室跑回家來，一到家，不聽見孩子哭，就聽到孩子叫媽叫爸，一刻没有靜息的。——魏雪生聽到孩子的噪，把他疲倦了整天的身子，沈入苦悶的海裏了。他討厭孩子，更不捨得妻爲了這三個「鼻涕囝」，弄得這麽瘦，這麽勞苦。他日間辦公，到晚上，原該享受些家庭的樂趣，將精神調劑一下，然而他回到家裏，只有一種瘴氣，一種使人煩亂的呌噪。</p>
<p>「今天回家又遲了咧。」</p>
<p>「哦。」</p>
<p>魏雪生跨進門口，妻照例地説了這句話，就不再説第二句；他的回答，也正是冰冷冷的。辦了整天公，到這時，他眞的困倦了，坐在一張籐椅裏，毫無心緒的抽着紙烟。</p>
<p>默默地，嘴裏噴着烟霧。</p>
<p>「小孩子是能破壞夫婦幸福的　，一個小庭，最好不生孩子　　　　　　　　　　　　魏雪生想。</p>
<p>想起没有孩子，剛剛結褵時候，家裏是乾乾凈凈的，充盈着這屋子裏的只有溫柔和甜蜜。妻年輕，貌美，會打扮。　的美麗和修飾，常常使魏雪生覺得興奮，一天的困乏，往往因看到妻就會消失的。他們每晚坐在長椅上，看夜報，談天，戲謔，難也没有人來打擾；但現在，爲了管理三個孩子和一切家務，妻再没有餘間打扮。衣服總是穿得那麽老式，臉不上塗粉，黄而且瘦，看年紀，照她原來的年齡似乎要虚大五歲。她老了，失了婀娜的豐姿，完全變成個可憐的，困倦在生活下的主婦。她再也没有空閑，能够和丈夫同坐在長椅上談天，也從不和丈夫輕蕩的戲謔，她的態度却變得十分嚴肅，冰冷，悒鬱。因此魏雪生一回家，坐到那張籐椅上，沈默着，只感到淡然無味，好像有一塊暗雲罩上他的心頭。</p>
<p>「小孩子眞是能够破壞夫婦幸福的……」</p>
<p>到孩子哭，　坐在　　　的魏　　　　　　　　　　小孩子，眞是破壞　　　　福的惡魔。　有了孩子，把丈夫的愛全移到孩子身上去，只曉得愛護孩子，再不會體貼丈夫；只留心孩子的冷熱，而不再注意丈夫的飲食。一個辛苦了終天的丈夫，回家來得不到妻的安慰，精神上的缺陷，不能拿任何東西來彌補的。魏雪生太缺乏精神生活的調劑使他生活在這樣糅莒的，一刻不靜息的家庭裏，着實是苦痛。</p>
<p>魏雪生的精神，漸漸變得遲鈍了。</p>
<p>産過第三個小孩子，妻就和他分床。丈夫的舖搭在暗暗的屋角裏，晚上七點多鐘，魏雪生不看報，也不想做些工作，就懶懶的到那小舖上睡了。明早起身，一個人溜出門外去。</p>
<p>「媽，我要屙屎啦！」</p>
<p>「媽！媽！」</p>
<p>「哇！哇哇……」</p>
<p>跑出家門，魏雪生每天聽到小孩子這樣叫。他的心，便像止水般的凝滯了。</p>
<h3>辨字與辨詞（二）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>主——虧你還算是國文敎員，還要笑青年的國文程度一代不如一代呢：還要説這樣别字連篇，你從來所没見過呢！</p>
<p>客——照你這樣説來，你那些學生都是精通説文，善寫古字的！</p>
<p>主——我説，「别字」若僅是現代青年獨有的弊病，那是青年的過錯；若是這個通病，自古如此，那就不能怪現代青年了。你老兄，堂堂國文敎師，也還要寫别字讀别字，那更不能怪現代青年了。我告訴你罷：讀别字寫别的毛病，三千年前的人如此，二千年前的人也如此，一千年前的人也如此，半斤八兩，誰也不配嘲笑誰！古人讀别字寫别字，説文定下一個條例，叫做「假借」；旣然「假借」是用字的通例，爲什麽古人可以假借，後人就不許假借呢？古人假借，有兩條路子，一形近。相借，二音近相借。青年本不精通説文，但這兩條假借的路，青年無意中却走上了。譬如「倔强」寫作「屈强」，「强弱」寫作「疆弱」，「恐嚇」寫作「恐赫」，「抹殺」寫作「末殺」，「藩籬」寫作」藩離」，「鋒鋩」寫作「鋒芒」，「戰慄」寫作」戰栗」，「伺察」寫作「司察」，……却無意中寫了正字，合説文的原意了。依我看來，中國文字在没有根本改革以前，「形近相借，音近相借」兩條假借規則永遠適用，我們就不該輕易嘲笑現代青年了。而且「輻凑」，漢書王莽傳作「四海輻奏」，「奬勸」，王莽傳作「將勸」，「擬似」，王莽傳作「疑似」王莽傳的價值自在，從來没人嘲笑班孟堅，説他的史筆以别字連篇而减色呢！你且仔細想想，現代青年爲寫幾個别字，究竟和國文程度有什麽關係？我有一句老實話告訴你，語言文字是比較專門的學問，你若不懂什麽，你還是少開口爲妙！</p>
<p>客——那麽，現在青年的國文程度爲什魔不如從前呢？</p>
<p>主——老兄，你又來了，誰説現代青年的國文程度不如從前呀？我看你連章太炎的國故論衡都没看過！你所説的「從前」，究竟指什麽現代，那幾個作家？若指唐宋八大家，韓愈·柳宗元·歐陽修·三蘇那些文人，請你先看一看國故論衡論式篇，章太炎，老兄一向崇拜他，説是什麽大文豪的。他説：「夫李翶·韓愈，局促儒言之閒，未能自遂。權德與吕溫及宋司馬光輩，略能推論成敗而已。歐陽修曾鞏，好爲大言，汗漫無以應敵，斯持論最短者也！若乃蘇軾文子，則佞人之戔戔者！」老兄若拿唐宋八大家來儆青年的文章模範，章太炎先生會贊成嗎？你説，青年的國文程度不如從前，還是説論理，「組織」不如從前呢？還是説「修辭」·「造句」不如從前呢？章太炎先生又説：「魏晋之文持論彷彿晚周，氣體雖異，要其守已有度，伐人有序，和理在中，孚尹旁達，可以爲百世師。」又説：「凡立論欲其本名家，不欲其本縱横。」可見文章以理論周密爲主。（顔之推文章篇也説：「文章當以理致爲心胸，氣調爲筋骨，事義爲皮膚，華麗爲冠冕。」）我們且擱「修辭」，「造句」慢提，單就「理論」·「組織」來説，你心目中那些古人，唐宋八大家，桐城派·陽湖派等等，决不會比現代青年高明；至於那些有鬍子自命爲文言正宗的老古董，那一定不如現代青年多多了。</p>
<p>客——好，你且舉幾個例子來看！</p>
<p>主——文章通不通，頂要緊是看理論錯不錯；所以老古董打批語，也用「有見地」，「有識力」那些話頭，你先得承認這個前提。</p>
<p>客——我承認這個前提。</p>
<h3>微笑（三）</h3>
<p>— 英國Lamernce著唐錫如譯</p>
<p>那個修道院長，她有一副好幾處像馬太自已的，大的五官的臉孔，摒命想忍住不笑，可是他把他的骨稽的惡意的下巴，仰起來對好她時，微笑便逐漸逐漸的在她臉上浮泛出來了，她把臉孔慢慢的低了下去，低了下去。</p>
<p>那個年青的蒼白的尼姑，突然把她的衣袖掩住了她的臉孔，她的身子在颤動着，修道院長把她的手臂放在她的肩上，用那種意大利人的情感喃喃地語：「可憐的小東西！那末，就哭罷！可憐的小東西！」不過在這情感下，那格格的笑聲，仍然是在那兒的，這個强壯的微黑的尼姑，仍舊不動的站在那兒，握着那黑色的念珠，可是那無聲的微笑，也是不能移動的。</p>
<p>馬太突然把他的頭轉到牀那一面去，看看他的死了的妻子是否在看着他，這是一個恐懼的動作。</p>
<p>奥斐麗亞是那麽美麗的，動人的躺着，她的尖起的，死白色的小鼻子向上聳着，她的臉孔，是一個頑强的小孩的臉孔，注視着那最後的頑强，微笑從馬太臉上消失了，換上了最崇高的殉敎的臉容，他並不哭泣：他祗是没有意義的呆瞪着，祗是在他的臉孔上，那神色是更加憂鬱了：我曉得我心内有這個殉敎的意念的！</p>
<p>她是那麽美麗，那麽小孩子似的，那麽聰明，那麽頑强，那麽疲憊，——和那麽死寂的，他對於這一切，全覺得是空空洞洞的。</p>
<p>他們已經結婚了十年了，他自已一直没有學好過，——不，不，無論那一點都没有學好過，奥斐麗亞永遠是有她自已的意志的。她曾經愛過他，後來變得倔强了，和他離開了，然後是十一二次的變成默然的，或是傲慢的，或是憤怒的，可是二一二次的仍舊回到他那兒去。</p>
<p>更正：昨日小説題下（一）應作（二）：又最後一行下的（，）應作（。）；又辦字與辨詞一文中「芒。芒禹跡」句中多一（。），一并更正於此，希讀者注意。</p>

<h3>猪年説猪</h3>
<p>— 肖猪生</p>
<p>駡，亦算是一種侮辱，卽家人和朋友，尙不免因謾駡而傷感情。我駡了人家，果然反應立至，人家駡了我，亦豈肯甘休。但往往事有出於常情以外者，如今年友輩及家人都駡我臭猪，爛猪，死猪。雖説今年是猪年而我又是肖猪的，猪仔當令，大家帶些尋開心之意，可是，總覺含有幾分侮辱，然而，我却並不以爲恥，笑而受之，是忍辱嗎？不是，因爲我倒因此而有題目可做。</p>
<p>我旣然自已承認是猪，當然先從自已這條猪説起。究竟臭不臭？倒是無關宏旨的。或者平日懶於修飾，什麽巴黎香水精，美國鴨蛋粉，倫敦美艷霜之類没有塗一點抹一層，或者吃了韮菜大蒜没有含一塊　　香糖在嘴裏，致使人家的嗅覺裏充份地感到不快，這不打緊，因爲我這猪肉唯其臭爛，才不至於有出賣的危險，這是在精神上十分欣慰的。猪雖笨蠢，尙不失爲忠厚者，設有人指我爲虎狼，則我將認爲奇恥大辱，誓必與之交涉爭辯。蓋當今之世，公理，和平，道德，人格，幾完全爲一輩如虎如狼之人破壞摧毁，他們是世界最大的罪人，他們惡毒卑污，卽在瀑布下也冲洗不清。猪雖是個弱者，却酷愛和平，永不會有侵略别人的野心，穿牆越垣的舉動就更不會幹了。</p>
<p>所最可憐而又可恨的，人們都見猪忠厚可欺，非但把卑視的眼光對牠們，而且待遇特别刻薄，把人們吃剩下來的渣滓湯水餵給牠們，讓牠們居留在簡陋髒濕的地方。人們畜養猪，是爲了猪的生命嗎？夢想！那一個養猪的不是爲了猪肉呢。這是猪或許是不知道人類殘暴的手段，等到刀子扔到頸根時，只才明白，然亦祗有呌一聲，抛幾滴眼涙完事。猪或許是早已知道人們的鬼計，但，自已向來是被視爲畜類的，不敢向人們呼籲，或卽使呌喚幾聲，亦徒促早死而已。我時常有一種幻想，假使猪仔們亦能把頭腦放清醒點，稍稍加以振作，那麽，人們輕視猪仔的心理，亦可稍减了吧？</p>
<p>鄉間有一種偷猪賊，手段很高明，他懂得猪的心理，往往在深更半夜，挖開人家猪窠屋的門，動手時，先把一攤甜醬往那猪嘴上一抹，這時，猪儘是伸出舌子舐吃嘴邊的甜醬，一切都任讓賊排佈，甚至把牠整個肉體拖出到上地廟殺了，賣了，吃了。這當然不能算是猪的忠厚，而該説猪昏庸過甚了。牠祗知道嘴邊有甜醬可吃，而不知道這甜醬正是敵人的果餌。然而，此一説也。試觀夫人世間的芸芸衆生，又誰個不想嚐些甜頭，而結果掉了性命，仍木然不知。那麽，我固不必笑猪的昏庸貪嘴也。</p>
<h3>馬車</h3>
<p>— 周漢</p>
<p>到了南京，我喜歡出門坐馬車。可是，我喜歡坐蓬式的馬車，不喜歡坐轎式的馬車。轎式的馬車不能够望望車外的景物，有如囚車，那是悶煞我的，我不喜歡：蓬式的馬車那是多麽有趣啊，一路上我可以欣賞天空的飛雲，與蔚藍的山色，又可以觀察經過的路旁風景與來往的人物呢。你在上海，以爲坐汽車是頂舒服的了吧？其實，坐馬車那才舒服呵。你没有坐過馬車嗎？你不相信？來吧，什麽時候你到南京跑一趟，逛他兩三天，我陪你坐馬車去逛，保你十分滿意。</p>
<p>我坐馬車還有一個脾氣合别人不同。我不高興那駿馬與新車的風馳電逝地跑；我喜歡那老馬與舊車的慢吞吞地走。你笑我阿木林嗎？你才是阿木林哩。你要知道，我坐馬車是去逛的，并不是趕路，老馬與舊車的慢吞吞地走，便給我坐在車上，可以眺望風景，看看馬路了。而且，車一慢慢地走，我還可以合馬車夫談閒天。有一次，我僱一部馬車遊明孝陵去，自然那是一部老馬與舊車的蓬式馬車；恰好，那馬車夫又是一個喜歡哇啦哇啦的老頭兒，你相，他合我談得多麽的起勁？開始他是告訴我一些他個人的身世與生活，後來他竟講一些幽默的故事給我聽呢。</p>
<p>可是，關於馬車的話，也就告訴你太多了；現在告訴你，明孝陵之逛吧。</p>
<p>明孝陵你是逛過的，景物如昔没有什麽好説；告訴你，我碰到一椿好笑的事呵。當我下了馬車，獨自步行的逛明孝陵的時候，起初我只賞識秋林秋色，并没留心有人對我的注意·到了陵幕那裏，後面跟着一個男子，他竟合我説話啦。你以爲我自然不怕男子的糾纒，可是，你猜錯了，在那幽靜寥落的荒野，我要害怕起來了。但是那個男子對我并不怎樣的可惡，只是又屬一個講究「禮貌」的Gentleman吧了。他的西裝雖然并不怎樣的時髦，可是看來到也穿得十分講究的，——别的不説，那褲子就筆直地顯出一條很好的壓痕。他起初是稱讚我膽子大，一個女人獨自到那裏來逛。後來，他竟問起我是那一個學校的學生，和我住在那裏的話。我自然不告訴他。他説得十分謙恭地道，「女士，（他眞的稱我爲女士，）膽略過人，一定是了不得的人材，可以説是巾帼英雄，我是十分敬服的。如果不覺得合我這種人來往是可恥的事，告訴我你的地址，使我得以時常登門領敎，在我是萬分榮幸的事。」你説，我拒絶他的要求了吧？不，我告訴他我的地址。可是，我并非説眞話，我扯了個謊。他也是僱馬車來的，後來，他的馬車老是跟着我們，我急了，一進城，改坐黄包車溜走了。</p>
<p>告訴你吧，我這一次，是好比探險去了的呵。可是，那多有趣。</p>
<h3>吃長齋</h3>
<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>頭，是瘦小的，有一點像冬瓜的形態；皮膚，淡黄而帶陰黯，乾得没有一點油水。眉，生在額上，離開眼睛實在是太遠了，幾乎使人疑心那是用墨畫上的。眼，緊靠在扁平的鼻邊，他一看起人來，眼縫擠成了一線；整個的臉部，是非常特異的；孔阜，他是一個吃長齋的老頭兒。</p>
<p>是八年以前的事；在我還没有離開故鄉的時候；孔阜，在我童年的生涯中，也曾留下了個深刻的印象。</p>
<p>一個百花怒放的春天，一羣頑皮的小捆戲，我也雜在裏面；見了花就拉，見了飛蟲就捉，我的手中，正捉了一個没有生毛的小麻雀在玩弄，非常有趣地的。</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛！怎麽要麻雀」？我的肩上，被一隻瘦骨梗梗的手壓住了；急一加頭，看到孔阜的眼睛拚成了一線，死釘着我的中的麻雀。「放了吧，積積陰</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>功，放生是可以修來世的」他不待我答應，劈手奪了我手中的麻雀，往樹梢頭一伸一縮的爬了上去，歸還在窠裏，他是怪會爬樹的。</p>
<p>積陰功在幼小孩子的心靈中是没有想到，而且也不懂得的；最使我傷心的是他奪掉了我的玩意兒，没有給我用小瓦片殺死，我嚎啕大哭了。</p>
<p>「不要哭，我給你五個銅角子一。眼涙卽刻停止了，黄澄澄的五個銅子，對一個幼小的孩子是有相當偉力的。</p>
<p>以後，我不論捉到了任何動物，總是故意給孔阜看到，以便弄幾個銅子買糖吃。</p>
<p>「冰大嫂，你常常病病痛痛的，還是吃長齋吧，吃長齋可以消病去災，修福後代的」。在某一天的下午，孔阜到我家裏來，和我母親閒談着，他是我家的佃農。</p>
<p>「阜老，你眞長年不吃一點魚肉麽」？母親現出不相信的口吻。</p>
<p>「當然哪，我是在神前許下了願心的」。孔阜現出足以自豪的樣子：「不要説魚肉，就是嘴唇粘了一點蛋楂也要大吐了陣，我是粘不得葷腥的」。</p>
<p>「你的兒子是不吃齋的啊」！</p>
<p>「説他們不聽也没有辦法」！他有點氣憤的樣子，兩隻猪眼用力的抬起來瞅着母親。「我不同他們同桌吃飯的，就是他們炒了菜的鍋我也要洗兩三次再用，我粘不得他們的油葷氣，粘了一點就要吐。」</p>
<p>母親留下孔阜在我們家裏吃飯。</p>
<p>「冰大嫂，你們的豆腐裏放了些什麽香料」？孔阜指着桌上的碗。「是頂上的茶油炒的麽？眞好吃得很」！</p>
<p>四哥在屋角上扮着鬼臉吃吃地笑，我知道他又在出花頭了。</p>
<p>「四哥，笑什麽」？我輕輕的走了過去。</p>
<p>「笑孔阜吃猪油豆腐哩」！聲音怪輕的。</p>
<p>已是好幾個年頭没有回故鄉了；孔阜是否還健在呢？是否還到處勸人吃長齋呢？自已的肚皮裏已裝過一次猪油了，他知道不？</p>
<h3>老陳的失意</h3>
<p>— 南雁</p>
<p>踐了老陳的約，我怱忙地踏上電車，到Ｃ公園去。</p>
<p>走進公園，眼睛向四下裏一　，冷清清地一個遊人也没有。</p>
<p>有此理，自己失約。」我這麽地自語着。於是便没精打采地沿着池邊緩緩地踱，穿過了假山，走上足球塲，時間是費去了差不多要到半個鐘頭了。</p>
<p>我時時朝着園門那邊探望，進來的游人是有的，然而老陳的影子却不得見，我焦迫得幾乎要跑回去。</p>
<p>霍地，從門口飄進了一對兒，立刻我認出男的就是老陳了。我用手朝空一揮，老陳便微笑着走近我這邊來，自然是同那位女的一起的。</p>
<p>由他的介紹後，我才知道這位少女便是密司黄。我偷眼瞧一瞧這位老陳的新友。一張俊俏的小臉兒，那雙烏溜溜的眼睛，就呌人醉迷，怪不得老陳用死勁在追逐着。</p>
<p>在公園裏走了一大圈，過橋，上坵，玩水，划小艇。大約在十一鐘左右，我們才走出了公園，步進了一間清靜的小飯館，雖則説是便飯，其實桌子上的菜，却是一盤一盤的緊擠着。</p>
<p>席上老陳用盡了平生所有的技術，向密司黄施展着，密司黄對他的態度，看來也很熱情似的。</p>
<p>「老陳的技術眞不錯呀！足可以上鈎的」。我暗自稱譖他。</p>
<p>在小飯館的門前，我便告别了他倆，臨行的時候，我以熱誠的口氣，請他倆一同在下星期到我的寓所用中飯。</p>
<p>請客的日子到了，清早起來，我便是上包飯館去　　老關，呌他多送　樣菜</p>
<p>回來後，我把房子裏打掃個　凈，坐着翻當天的報紙，等候着客人的降臨</p>
<p>時間眞爬得快，桌子上的座鐘的短針，已跑到了十一點與十二點的中間了，然而客人却不見來。我恐怕他倆那天正在沉醉於熱戀中，没有聽清楚我説的話，不然，就是忘記了日子。</p>
<p>因此，我便走過了鄰居，打了電話給他，接電話的人説他已不在家裏了。</p>
<p>從鄰居走回來，已是十二點鐘了。</p>
<p>突然，門篤篤地響。我猛的搶上前，扭開了門。</p>
<p>老陳站在門口，一把臉滿堆着掃興的神氣。而我期待着的賓客却只有他一個。</p>
<p>「密司黄怎麽不一起來呢？」我問。</p>
<p>他跨進房裏，立即倒下床，半嚮才説：</p>
<p>「女人眞難預測，媽媽的！」</p>
<p>接着就是一聲長嘆。</p>

<h3>有限與無限公司</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我在好久以前，常常在各處看到「某某有限公司」或「某某無限公司」　的店號，我就發生了一個疑問；不知「有限公司」與「無限公司是什麽意義，兩者有什麽分别？很想請先生替我解答，可是我又恐怕這個問題不是屬於貴欄答覆的範圍的，所以不敢冒昧寫信。近來我曾把這個問題問過很多人，但他們都不能給我一個明白的答覆。不得已，特寫信給你，不知道你能不能解釋我的疑問呢？此上，敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　王履氷上</p>
<p>編者按：關於一般普通的問題，只要是我們所知道的，或者是我們在别處能够找到它的答案的，我們都願意給各讀者一個比較明白的解釋。這是我們從前所説過的話，也就是本欄的宗旨。</p>
<p>關於有限公司與無限公司之間是有很大的區别的。簡括的説：有限公司就是股份有限公司；凡是入股的股東所負的責任，僅限於所投下的資本。例如有一家有限公司，有十位股東，每位出股份一萬元。假使這家公司營業大虧，損失雖在十萬以上，但這些股東所負的責任，不過是一萬元，額外的虧欠是不再負責的。</p>
<p>無限公司的股東就不同了。這些股東是負着無限責任，當本公司受到非常虧折時，他們不但損失原定資本額，並且還要負着償還一切債務的責任。這樣組織的公司，就呌做無限公司。</p>

<h3>新聞片的本質及其攝製（上）</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>代表歷史上的一頁紀載</p>
<p>值價由事件變化而估定</p>
<p>我們走進了一家影戲院去看電影，除了正片之外，還有卡通畫片，新聞片等。本文所要提出討論的，便是新聞片的本質及其攝製。總之，新聞片的值價，每視其事件的大小而估定，一張普通的新聞片，隔了一個相當時期，便不能再公映。但是如果事件很大，或是和政治有重大關係，那麽就是隔了幾年，乃至幾十年，幾百年，也有放映的可能。因新聞片在本質上，原可代表歷史的一頁紀載，而它的值價，更因爲歷史課本祗用文字紀載，而新聞片能把眞蹟在銀幕上放映，也許比歷史的紀載更可貴。</p>
<p>至於新聞征的攝製，更以神速，特出爲上乘。一件事情，在歐洲或美洲發生之後，隔不到一兩個月，在上海便可看見公映了。所隔時間的短促，和攝製的神速，却不能不使我們驚奇，而且在攝製的時候，那些工作人員危險的程度,勇敢的精神，有時竟使我們咋舌不止呢！在新聞片中，有的雖然是很平凡的，但閲兵典禮，舉行之日，國王也將親自檢閲，可是到了那天，忽然發生變卦，國王並没有到塲檢閲，另由其他官長檢閲的，那時這新聞片所拍攝的閲兵典禮，豈不因國王的變卦而降低其價值嗎？換句話説，要是國王親自檢閲，在途中撞車受傷，或被人行刺，發生了慘劇，那時攝取新聞片的，便得到了意外的收穫，事件是擴大了，新聞片本身的值價也抬高了，然而在拍攝之初，影片公司方面，連夢也想不到有這慘案發生而可攝得如此可貴的新聞片哩。</p>
<p>不久之前，上海曾映過福斯公司的「馬賽慘案」新聞片，爲使讀者明瞭新聞片的攝製情形起見，不妨把「馬賽慘案」攝製的始末一説。馬賽慘案在十月九日發生，而十一月底馬賽慘案的新聞片，却在上海公映了。相隔祗四五十天，而且中間還受過阻撓，否則還可更早些。這一次南王亞歷山大的蒞臨法國，在政治史上確是重要的一頁，因而抵法之日，各影片公司的攝影師，都集中在馬賽，預備拍攝種種新聞，而事前所估定的，這一種新聞片，本身方面，值價也是普通的，那知亞歷山大的被刺，巴爾都的同車殉身，便突然的增加了這新聞片的值價，原是意外的收穫。當福斯公司攝製「馬賽慘案」新聞片之前，一共派遣四個攝影師：麥琪脱弟兄，喬治，和萊蒙。他們都是福斯駐法的攝影隊，工作的分配，萊蒙攝南王在碼頭上岸的一段，喬治收取載南王的空車由馬賽街市中開來時行車的音響，麥琪弟兄攝取零碎的鏡頭。</p>
<p>汽車把南王亞歷山大和法外長巴爾都載了進去，喬治便停止了收音工作，換了一架手提攝影機，跟了南王的車子，在寸步不離的走，和車子離得很近；萊蒙便換了收音工作，跟了儀仗前進，同時還留心在街上有無可攝入鏡頭的新聞。亞歷山大的汽車到了證券交易所區域那一段，一個很高大的人突然從人叢中跳上了登車堦，喊着幾聲「陛下」衛隊很躊躇，這個人是刺客呢還是王室的醉漢？可是不一秒鐘，意外的慘案已經發生了。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「重畫蛾眉」</h3>
<p>— 尤競</p>
<p>Let's　Sry　Again——大上海</p>
<p>夫婦間情感破裂之後，還不得不貌合神離，同床異夢地維繫下去，這原是人間痛苦的事。把它作爲題材來製作一件藝術品時，若是作者對於牠的認識與把握得妥當的話，是很可以成爲有價值的成功作品的。</p>
<p>「重畫蛾眉」便是描寫没有愛情之夫婦的片子。牠所以没有成功的主要點倒不在「搬演愛之糾紛或無聊」，而是在於作者對於這樣問題之没看本質的理解。</p>
<p>大醫士賈克與愛麗絲夫婦隨着結婚後的十年流光，淡去了愛情，男的由於職務上的機會戀愛了舞女。女的愛上了未婚的姪女婿保爾。</p>
<p>後來，保爾又因未婚妻已懷有身孕，爲了她的幸福而斷絶了這有夫之婦的愛麗絲。賈克也由於所謂良心的發現而中途抛棄了舞女來重燃已灰的愛火，而愛麗絲居然也讓他來重畫已斷的愁眉。</p>
<p>這兒作者雖苦心地作了一次改良主義的説敎，可是其如事實的無情何呢！</p>
<p>演出方面也不見怎樣高明，全片鬆弛，不生動，不緊張。由舞臺劇改編一原著者是Ｖincent　Lawrence一，而不能採取舞臺劇緊凑簡潔的好處來電影藝術的地應用，只承繼了這舞臺劇背景單調，對話冗長與一條綫地發展的缺點如姪女兒美琪的有孕，保爾與美琪的結合等没有簡潔而扼要的畫面來烘托，連賈克與愛麗絲的重行結合這一主要的關鍵，也没有必要與充分的過程，全靠對話來作劇情的進展，這總不是電影藝術的好手法吧。</p>
<p>自然，也有些頗爲可取的地方，比如音樂，在這兒就很好地盡了牠的效用。在愛麗絲赴了夜會回來，受了丈夫冷淡的待遇而漫步在月光下時，幽怨凄凉的音樂，無言地寓出了這閨中少婦的衷曲，在保爾吻她時奏出一段似乎悲中樂的調子，可是很快地隨着她衣裾的撕破，又變成了憂鬱的音調。這一段音樂與月光的交流，頗Sentimental地，詩意地表現出劇中人的心境與遭受之變化的。可是將完了時作者把俱樂部的跳舞音樂來刺激女主人公，作爲她回心轉意的關鍵，這是她剛説完「香檳雖好，可惜青春不再，愛已倦老了」那些話之後，却未免太突兀滑稽了。</p>
<p>他如用保爾坐破愛麗絲的裙裾來象徵他們間的愛的破裂。在愛麗絲獨自吃晚飯時，用修長的燭影與燭涙來表現她在愛的憧憬與幻滅時的悲哀。以及在揷瓶花的小事情上也顯着夫妻間的反目等的都是可愛的小聰明處。</p>
<p>織接上前局寫舞女的跳舞與治病的一段，簡直是拙笨的多餘，這很可以技巧地揷在中間的。</p>
<p>演員方面Diana　Wynyard　與　ＣliveBrook没有在「亂世春秋」中那麽成功，但其中以前者爲較好。飾男僕非力泊的Arthur　Hoyt　演來倒頗爲可取。</p>
<h3>影漫電話</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>有人問：爲什麽批評家必要勉强一個從事藝術的人從現實的環境取材，而不肯讓他在他的豐富的理想中創造他的王國？」</p>
<p>接着是一個武斷而只能使少數和他們同樣連藝術的本質都不十分瞭解的人才會相信的結論，「藝術家的偉大不在乎他能忠實地摸倣」現實。</p>
<p>是的，藝術家的偉大不在乎他能忠實地「模倣」（？）現實，而在乎他能正確地分晰現實，理解現實，透視現實！</p>
<p>稍微有些修養的人誰都不會否認藝術是客觀存在的反映，誰也不會否認用生活來解釋藝術的可能，只有愈接近生活，愈眞實的作品才愈能感動人心。</p>
<p>有人説，藝術家的偉大在乎他能運用他的天才與學力創造起現實的境界，使芸芸衆生，不，使少數紳士都能在狹隘的現實中獲得一刻的解放。</p>
<p>然而，試問，只靠一藝術家的天才與學力就能成爲一件藝術品嗎？至少，他得表現一些東西，而這些東西就是客觀的存在通過了作者的觀念反映出來的。</p>
<p>就是牛頭馬面，科學怪人，肥醫玉腿以至紳士們一切所愛好的東西决不是一個藝術家只運用他的天才與學力所能空想得出來的，而也都是通過作家的觀念的客觀的存在的反映。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「再生花」的話</h3>
<p>— 爾音</p>
<p>「姊妹花」曾經抓住過一般普通的羣衆，「再生花」還是抓住了一般普通的羣衆。</p>
<p>内容是意料中的開展着，一切都是適合大部分的觀者，像老年人，女人………</p>
<p>導演的手術，自然是很高明的。結構的支配，我以爲王獻齋得錢放大寳她們的一段非常得當，利用了人家的料不到，使觀者愕然，直至樓梯下的自白。</p>
<p>演員，胡蝶和宣景琳絲毫找不出令人失望的地方。王獻齋，譚志園極佳。後者尤其是盡量地施展了他的才能，梅熹和趙月也能稱職。</p>
<p>一件使人感到美中不足的事：就是飾桃哥的鄭小秋太那個了。他簡直不知道怎樣來表演得深刻一點。全劇，只有吃醉酒的一段，比較稱職些。</p>
<p>「抓人，抓人」暴露着過去軍閥對革命軍的壓迫，使人覺得那時候的前進的青年眞是痛苦極了，這一點，我是被特别感動的。</p>
<p>「再生花」這一條尾巴，總算没有弄巧成拙，這是我替明星公司額手稱慶的</p>

<h3>相逢待嫁（Forsaking　all　Others）（一）</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>美國米高梅出品　瓊克勞馥·克拉克蓋博等主演</p>
<p>明天這個時候，她已經是迭倫杜達夫人了。這似乎是件難以置信的事，但是確是事實。這時的曼麗克萊，很逍遥自在地躺在按摩牀上，在她富麗堂皇的臥室裏，儘着讓那個叫蓓拉的按摩女子搥着扶着。她一面躺着，一面算着已往的過去。她從七八歲的時候，就愛上了迭倫了。她和迭倫，和另外一個傑弗雷威廉姆斯，是在一塊兒長大的。他們是耳鬓磨，青梅竹馬，和兄弟姊妹一樣的。説到迭倫的人品，他是生性瀟灑，好從來没有愁恨之事的。無論遇到了什麽事，他總是嘻嘻哈哈，不當回事的。那時的曼麗，是個腿長，眼大，頭髮蓬鬆的小姑娘。她的歡喜迭倫，亦就是因爲他天性豪放。傑弗雷的天性，可是凝重得多了。他從小的時候，就露着深思熟慮的態度。他是總在曼麗左右的，遇見了她跌痛了膝蓋骨的時候，他是總在旁安慰她的，遇見了打架的時候，他總是保護她的。有的時候，迭倫無意之中得罪了她，傑弗雷總是在旁邊寛慰她的。</p>
<p>後來大家都長大了。傑弗雷亦出門，到西班牙去了。他説他是去發財去的，他笑着説。迭倫呢，還是照舊的歡天喜地，無憂無慮，加之以丯神飄逸，人才倜儻，很容易博得女子的歡心……不差的，他在巴黎曾經有過一個繾綣的女子，但是現在已經置之腦後了。不到二十四個鐘頭，他就要和曼麗克萊結婚了。在曼麗的心理，亦祗有這件事，是她覺得驚心動魄的。她現在臉上塗着一層厚厚的油膏，蓬鬆的頭髮，用一條絲帶綑着拖在一旁，但是不到二十四個鐘頭，她就要做新嫁娘了。這個時候，蓓拉亦不知想些什麽，偶然出了神，在曼麗的背上，重重地拍了一下。曼麗不覺嚇了一跳，喊了起來道：「喂，蓓拉，小心些……我不要明天報紙上登着；新婚美麗極了，背上青紫相間，斑駁陸離……」蓓拉很生氣地將曼麗的髮辫，向旁邊一摔，然後説道：「青也好，紫也好，黑也好，黄也好。嫁人太没有意思了。」她説着，狠命地扶着，曼麗一聲不響，隨她擺佈。</p>
<p>一回兒，房門開了，曼麗側着身體，一半爬了起來，葆拉跳進來。葆拉是嬌小玲瓏，裝扮得活像一個洋囡囡，走起路來，總是一跳一跳的。曼麗差不多是他從小帶大的。她看見了曼麗躺在牀上，蓓拉替她搥着，她不覺張着嘴喊道：「曼麗！你結婚那快要開始了，怎麽還躺着叫人家搥着呢？蓓拉，不要給她搥了！滿屋子的人，都等着你下去哩！你怎麽好像没有事似的躺着……我買了一下午的東西，一切都弄好了，我的腰都要癱下來了。什麽？你當我没有看見過結婚嗎？」曼麗笑着道：「寳貝的葆拉，我没有你，简直就不興。這些東西，你一定很曉得的……」蓓拉假意欷歔道：「她怎麽會不曉得呢？她不是已經葬過了三個男人了嗎？」蓓拉在葆拉手下作事很久了，所以放肆些亦不要緊的。葆拉亦一些不生氣，她還説道：「你説錯了。我祗葬過兩個丈夫。第三個亦不知道上那兒去了。」蓓拉道：「大概是到外國充軍去了吧。」葆拉且不理睬她，祗看着曼麗很歡喜地問她道：「開心嗎？」曼麗道：「不，我覺得在我走到神壇前面之先，我會死過去，或是暈過去的。」葆拉追念着自已的經騐，安慰她道：「不要緊的。破題兒第一遭，總是這樣的。」可是外面有人打着門，將葆拉的話頭打斷。（未完）</p>

<h3>Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission Plans to Build a Mongolian-Tibetan Pavilion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission will invite border region political and religious leaders to enter the capital in rotation to pay respects to the government this year. Regarding daily life, there is no suitable reception venue in the capital. It is planned to build a Mongolian-Tibetan Pavilion. Previously, Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, drafted an engineering outline. The exterior will be in the style of a palace. The interior will be divided into: 1. Mongolian yurt style, 2. Mongolian-Tibetan Buddhist hall style, 3. Mongolian-Tibetan ancestral hall style. The Mongolian yurt will have a Mongolian-Tibetan Buddhist hall decorated in the style of Inner Mongolia, with great statues of the Buddha, Muhammad, Genghis Khan, and other great figures, as well as the portrait of Premier Sun. The ancestral hall will adopt a five-race united style, taking the strengths of each race's art to form a pattern. In addition, the interior layout will include a Mongolian pavilion, Tibetan pavilion, Mongolian-Tibetan guest rooms, bedrooms, dining rooms, and other rooms, mostly using plains to create artificial pastures and hunting grounds. The total area is about one hundred acres, and the funding is calculated at one copper coin per person for 400 million people, totaling over 1 million yuan. Due to funding issues, the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission fears that it will be difficult to raise all the funds in a short period of time. A flexible method is now being considered, first building a smaller-scale Mongolian-Tibetan Pavilion according to Dai's design, and then rebuilding it when funds are abundant. It is currently being planned. (11th Day Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Future of the US Silver Act and the World Silver Market</h3>
<p>Since the United States enacted the Silver Purchase Act on May 12, 1934, the world silver market has undergone significant changes, affecting both silver-producing and silver-consuming nations. Recent reports from Handy &amp; Harman on the world silver market over the past year (Reuters, New York, 7th of this month) and statistics from the National News Agency on the fluctuations of US gold and silver reserves (National News Agency, Washington, 3rd of this month) provide us with a clear opportunity to understand the effectiveness of the US Silver Act. At this time of unpredictable changes in the world silver market, a retrospective view is particularly interesting.</p>
<p>The US Silver Purchase Act was, in effect, initiated after the United States halted its gold purchase policy and actively engaged in devaluing the US dollar. It was one aspect of the overall movement of the US currency war. The implication of the Act itself is highly contradictory to the Silver Agreement established by the United States at the London Economic Conference in 1933. The basic goal of the London Silver Agreement was to stabilize the silver market, whereas the result of the Silver Purchase Act was to encourage a rise in the silver market. Not only did the editors of the "Monthly Report of the National City Bank of New York" consider this detrimental to the interests of non-silver-using countries (Reuters, New York, 2nd of this month), but people worldwide shared this view.</p>
<p>The outcome of the US Silver Act certainly caused the world silver price to soar. However, the reason for this lies in the Act's ultimate goal: to achieve a ratio of three parts gold to one part silver in the US hard currency reserve. Based on the US Treasury's total gold reserves of $7,711,600,000 at the end of April 1934, after subtracting the existing silver reserves at the time, approximately 1,350,000,000 ounces of silver needed to be purchased to meet the three-to-one ratio. However, can the United States, a nation with a huge trade surplus and overseas investments, absorb a massive amount of gold into the country each year? This is a question worthy of attention. According to the National News Agency, US gold reserves had already increased to a massive $8,232,000,000 by the end of last December. In fact, the rate of increase in silver reserves was almost the same as that of gold. In this case, the three-to-one gold-silver ratio would be impossible to achieve, and the effectiveness of the Silver Purchase Act would be completely lost. Even if it does not come to that, one cannot help but feel this way. If the development of gold and silver reserves is prepared for use during wartime, then its significance should be considered separately.</p>
<p>Is the US Silver Act a completely unprofitable move for the current United States? Not necessarily. According to Handy &amp; Harman's report, the United States absorbed 317,440,000 ounces of the world's silver supply in the past year. Its contribution to the upward movement of world silver prices is certainly not insignificant. Because of the rise in silver prices, world silver production reached 181,200,000 ounces, a phenomenon unseen in the past four years. It should be noted that 60% of the world's silver production is controlled and monopolized by US capital. What will be the impact on other countries? The purpose of the repeated efforts of the US silver advocates to create this miracle of increased production is self-evident. If they claim that their intention is to stabilize the world silver price, who would believe it?</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Committee for the Reorganization of Cultural Relics in the Former Capital</h3>
<p>Adoption of Rules of Procedure and Other Proposals</p>
<p>Designation of Five Committee Members to Manage Funds</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Committee for the Reorganization of Cultural Relics in the Former Capital held its inaugural meeting at 10:00 AM this morning. Committee Chairman Huang Fu, ex officio members Yu Xuezhong, Song Ziwen, Yuan Liang, Interior Ministry representative Luo Yaoshu, Railway Ministry representative Yin Tong, Communications Ministry representative Shen Jianshi, Finance Ministry representative Ding Chungao, and Central Cultural Relics Preservation Committee member Ma Heng attended on time. Appointed members Zhu Qiqian, Zhu Zhuo, Cheng Ke, Weng Wenhao, Yuan Tongli, Chen Zhongshu, Zhou Zuomin, and Fang Juehui were present, except for Fang Zaizhi, who was unable to come to Beijing. Chairman Huang Fu and Secretary Xia Qingyi recorded the minutes. After the meeting, each committee member discussed and passed each of the proposals submitted by the Chairman. The meeting adjourned at approximately 12:00 noon for lunch. After the establishment of the Committee for the Reorganization of Cultural Relics in the Former Capital, regarding the issue of funding, in addition to the 2.09 million yuan allocated by the Central Government, Beijing Municipality must raise an additional 1 million yuan, totaling 3.09 million yuan. The future costs for repairing river channels and reorganization will be even greater. It will be difficult for the Central Government to provide further subsidies, and Beijing Municipality will be unable to raise the funds on its own. It is heard that bonds will be issued at that time to meet the needs. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The inaugural meeting of the Committee for the Reorganization of Cultural Relics in the Former Capital was held today, and the following were passed: (1) Rules of Procedure for the Committee for the Reorganization of Cultural Relics in the Former Capital; (2) Implementation Procedures for the Reorganization of Culture; (3) Proposal to Establish a Committee to Manage Funds.

<h3>Poland to Develop Far East Trade</h3>
<p>Plans to Establish Consulates in Various Locations in China and Japan</p>
<p>And Organize a Business Delegation to Investigate Manchuria</p>
<p>Warsaw Today, during the discussion of the budget proposal in the Polish Sejm, the rapporteur on foreign affairs declared that the Polish government is currently conducting negotiations to strengthen Poland's economic ties with various countries in the Far East. The government is currently planning to establish honorary consulates in Yokohama, Osaka, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, India, Ceylon, etc. A business delegation will also be sent to Manchuria to conduct investigations in the near future. Opposition members of parliament took the opportunity to criticize the government's foreign policy and cooperation with Germany. Democratic MP Szurzyński said that Germany has not fulfilled its treaty obligations, such as the fact that the aviation organization in the Free City of Danzig is a branch of the German aviation organization. He then recounted the visit of former French Foreign Minister Barthou to Poland last year, saying that the Polish government's Eastern policy was indeed inappropriate. Finally, Socialist MP Biedroński spoke, questioning the government's attitude towards the Rome Accords, saying that it was too vague. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3>No Change in US Silver Policy</h3>
<p>But Efforts to Avoid Disrupting China's Finances</p>
<p>No Concrete Development in Sino-US Negotiations</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today from reliable sources that the US silver policy will not undergo any substantial changes from the outline in the note that Secretary of State Hull sent to Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji on October 12. The Silver Purchase Act passed by the previous Congress is mandatory, but the method of implementation can be determined by the government, as long as it does not violate the purpose. Therefore, the US government will do its best to avoid actions that disrupt China's economic finances. Although China and the United States have exchanged views from time to time since Hull's statement on October 12, there have been no fundamental new developments to change US policy. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also told reporters today that he had nothing to add to what Secretary of State Hull had said regarding China's silver problem, and that the United States did not want to make any further statements on its silver policy, because no matter what was said, it would be used by silver traders to speculate.</p>
<p>According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce today, although the Treasury Department denied reducing silver purchases, the number of US silver imports in December was indeed only slightly more than half of that in November. Silver imports in December were only US$8,710,685, while last month's figure was US$15,010,561. The main country from which the United States purchased silver was the United Kingdom, accounting for US$3,086,085, followed by Mexico with US$2,155,963, and China with US$1,126,777. The total amount of exports in December was US$1,013,732, while the amount in November was US$1,697,657. The inflow of cash into the United States has not stopped, but it has decreased slightly. The inflow in December was US$92,249,354, while the amount last month was US$121,198,645. The number of exports was very small, only US$129,877, and the amount last month was only US$309,659. The Treasury Department announced today that the amount of silver certificates and silver coins in circulation nationwide increased significantly in December, which is sufficient to indicate the promotion of the government's plan to use silver more extensively. According to Treasury Department statistics, the number of silver certificates and silver coins issued in December reached 35,667,743 yuan, bringing the total amount in circulation to a new high of 917,955,488 yuan. The total value of US currency decreased from 5,548,533,937 yuan to 5,535,713,269 yuan. If the increase in silver currency is combined, it can be seen that the government has withdrawn 48,488,411 yuan of other currencies. The total amount of silver certificates in circulation increased from 558,357,180 yuan to 591,563,417 yuan in October, silver subsidiary coins increased from 291,127,881 yuan to 294,345,965 yuan, and standard silver dollars increased from 31,797,684 yuan to 32,046,106 yuan. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Representative Somers, chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, told an Associated Press reporter today that he doubted that the current Congress would pass important monetary legislation. Somers not only believed that Congress would not change the gold content of the US dollar, but also that there were no other silver plans. Although government officials have repeatedly stated recently that they will continue to purchase large amounts of silver, according to Somers, the Treasury Department's silver purchases will ultimately have little result, because the eagerness to purchase silver depends on whether prices can be raised as a result. He said that since China is unwilling to sell silver and Mexico does not have much silver, the Treasury Department has no way to purchase it. "The Treasury Department's power is now very sufficient. Even if it wants to return to a silver standard for the US dollar, it is not impossible. Therefore, I do not feel that it is necessary to discuss another silver law. As for reducing the gold content, if there is such an intention, it should be proposed by the government, because the Treasury Department has more detailed information about this situation." In addition, Democratic Representative Day has requested that his two monetary proposals be publicly discussed. His proposals are as follows: (1) All US currency should be redeemed in standard silver dollars. (2) The Treasury Department should allocate the profits from reducing the gold content of the dollar to agricultural expenses. It is learned that the House leadership has not yet decided whether to allow the two proposals to be</p>
<h3>Fairbanks Couple Divorcing</h3>
<p>Los Angeles Today, the court granted Pickford and Fairbanks a separation. The trial was very short, only three minutes. Although the parties kept it a secret, the news quickly spread. The so-called beautiful Hollywood marriage that could be imitated has now broken down. Hollywood insiders were initially unaware of the sudden change and thought that the two could reconcile as before. Now, hearing this news is like a bolt from the blue. The two married in 1920, when they were both very famous on the silver screen. This was when Pickford was called the world's sweetheart. The perfection and longevity of their marriage had broken all previous records in Hollywood. The result is that it only increases people's memories of the couple warmly hosting many celebrities from around the world in their new home. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>publicly discussed. In addition, Senator Pope, a Democratic member of the Senate, also stated yesterday that the price of silver should reach $1.29 per ounce. Pope attacked the Treasury Department for its ineffective silver purchases and said that he was willing to support a return to a silver standard for the US dollar at a ratio of sixteen to one for gold and silver. Pope also admitted that he was drafting a proposal to make the gold-silver ratio vary according to the amount of silver produced in the world. Although the average gold-silver ratio has been sixteen to one for the past ten years, there should be room for adjustment if the production volume in the future is very different. Pope believed that after the price of silver rises, the United States may not have to worry about excessive imports of foreign silver, because foreign countries have recently been unwilling to sell, which is sufficient to show that there is not much silver in storage, and production has not increased. Therefore, a higher price can slightly stimulate the increase in production, and the whole world can benefit from its stimulation and develop a healthy economic situation.

<h3>Roosevelt Advocates Stable International Currency</h3>
<p>Japan Willing to Participate in International Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned from authoritative sources this morning that President Roosevelt is eager for international cooperation to seek currency stability. This international cooperation can be obtained at the International Monetary Conference, and this International Monetary Conference may resolve the world's currency war. It is learned that the price of the US dollar will remain at 59.06 before the International Conference is held. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to foreign wire reports, US President Roosevelt will convene a world economic conference to seek the agreement of various countries on measures such as reducing tariffs, abolishing import restrictions, and prohibiting imports in order to promote world trade. However, according to later reports, it is quite doubtful whether the US President actually has this intention. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its opinion on this issue, saying that if this news is true, the Japanese government is happy to participate in the conference and strive to reform the world's economic state. The world economic conference should first carefully study all the reasons that hinder trade, prohibit raising tariffs, allocate import quotas, prohibit imports, and all other policies that hinder trade. Finally, it is necessary to agree on exchange rates in order to smooth trade. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance announced that the amount of gold purchased up to December 29 last year was 20,951 kilograms, and the purchase price reached 84.789 million yuan. Also, the amount of gold purchase certificates that the government delivered to the Bank of Japan due to the purchase of gold reached 43.521 million yuan. The difference between the government's remaining gold purchase amount and the limit of 100 million yuan is only 56.479 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance feels that this remaining amount is not enough due to the increase in the purchase price, and it plans to increase it by another 100 million to 200 million yuan and decided to submit an amendment to the law at the next meeting. (Dentsu News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The London financial community was shocked to hear that the Japanese government increased the price of gold, but according to general opinion, this move is entirely influenced by domestic factors and has nothing to do with restoring the gold standard. The stock price of the Bank of Korea on the London stock market soared by one shilling and ten pence, reaching a market price of thirty-eight shillings and fifteen pence per share.

<h3>Dutch-Japanese Negotiations Fail</h3>
<p>Dutch East Indies Intensifies Exclusion of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Panic Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo News, the Dutch East Indies government is preparing to further restrict the import of Japanese goods. The restricted items are bicycles, paint, and several other items. The allowed import volume will be based on the import volume between 1932 and 1933. The restriction order will be implemented soon. Japanese merchants were quite panicked upon hearing the news. (China United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Kobe The Japanese government representatives and their entourage, a total of six people, who participated in the Dutch-Japanese negotiations, returned to Kobe on the Hakozaki Maru on the 10th. Government advisor Shizutaro Kamisaka said that the reason for the failure of the Dutch-Japanese negotiations was that problems such as the cotton cloth import allocation issue, the shipping issue, and the sugar issue arose at every turn, and they could not be resolved. The failure of the Kobe Maritime Conference means that the Batavia negotiations have also naturally disappeared. Therefore, the Kobe conference is the key to future Dutch-Japanese negotiations.

<h3>If New Naval Treaty Fails, Britain Will Expand Its Navy</h3>
<p>And Actively Develop Air Force</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph's naval reporter, Mr. Hayward, if the naval conference fails to establish a new treaty, the British Admiralty admits that there should be a large naval plan for a supplementary fleet in 1936. The naval budget for 1935 stipulates the construction of two or three 9,000-ton cruisers, one light cruiser, eight destroyers, and three submarines. The number of naval officers and soldiers will also increase. In addition, air defense preparations will be actively carried out, the offensive air force will be developed, and aircraft lift equipment will be installed on larger battleships. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>US Naval Authorities Do Not Favor Pocket Battleships</h3>
<p>Still Use Heavy Battleships as Main Force</p>
<p>(Washington) Although pocket battleships have attracted the attention of European political and naval circles, the US naval community does not consider them worthwhile. The Associated Press asked the naval authorities what kind of new battleships the US Navy would build after the naval treaty was abandoned and naval shipbuilding competition became a public fact. Senior naval authorities replied that the United States would continue to build a balanced fleet. In other words, large battleships, aircraft carriers, and armored heavy cruisers will still be the main force of the navy. Destroyers and auxiliary ships will continue to be built to ensure that their numbers are proportional to the number of battleships already built and under construction. Pocket battleships are only welcomed by countries with severely restricted fleets and countries that cannot build heavy battleships due to treaty relations. However, they are ineffective against current and future battleships, because the heavy artillery and weapons of battleships can destroy these pocket battleships. Moreover, pocket battleships have not attracted the attention of Japan and Britain. After the current naval treaty is abolished, the two countries will continue to seek fleet balance in their shipbuilding plans and will increase the number of battleships proportionally. Neither Britain nor Japan is willing to build pocket battleships or indiscriminately build submarines or light cruisers with insufficient power, thereby weakening their national defenses.

<p>Minister of Commerce Submits Bill to the House of Representatives</p>
<p>(Paris) Minister of Commerce Marchandeau has submitted a bill to the House of Representatives to allow France to implement industry regulations that are largely the same as those implemented by the US Reconstruction Agency. These agreements must be initiated by private individuals and exercised by the government. The industries stipulated in the bill are limited to those currently in difficulty. The main points are to limit working hours, preserve inventories, and issue bonds, which are closely related to the national economy. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the British-Indian Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>(London) The British-Indian trade agreement was signed in London yesterday. This is the result of the Lancashire direct delegation to India in 1933 for negotiations. Its main provisions are that Indian industries can obtain the protection necessary to ensure fair prices for Indian products and imported goods. According to this principle, the import tax on British goods will be lower than that on foreign goods, and this difference must not be changed to the disadvantage of Britain. The government recognizes that import taxes are an indispensable source of revenue for the Indian government and acknowledges that national tax revenues must be given significant consideration when setting import taxes. At the same time, the Indian government promises to apply high tax rates only to goods that require protective taxes in terms of tax concepts. The Indian government also promises that British industries will have full opportunity to present their cases to the Indian Tax Council. In another exchange of letters, the Indian government reiterated that it would reduce the cotton cloth tax when national tax revenues can eliminate the 5% surtax. In return, the British government will provide some guarantees for the treatment of Indian cotton cloth in the colonies and will cooperate with commercial organizations to develop the trade of Indian raw materials or semi-manufactured goods, such as cotton, imported into British colonies. The effective period of this trade agreement is transferred along with the Ottawa Agreement. After the signing of this agreement, India is on an equal footing with overseas autonomous territories in cotton goods and steel goods according to the Ottawa Agreement. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Persia to be Renamed Iran Starting March 21</h3>
<p>Persia's Capital Persia will change its name to the State of Iran starting March 21 (the Persian New Year). Persian Foreign Minister Kazemi recently sent a letter to the diplomatic representatives of various countries stationed in Persia, explaining the reasons for changing the name. He said that this move is widely supported by public opinion, because the name "Persia," in its original meaning, is only a province of the Persian Empire in history and geography. Therefore, it is appropriate to change the name to "Iran." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>ILO Report</h3>
<p>Advocates Implementation of Public Works Policy</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Office issued a report advocating the implementation of a public works policy to reduce and prevent unemployment. Each country should establish an agency to implement the policy, and an international central agency should be established to cooperate with each country to achieve the effect of coordination. As for the policy of regulating prices, a laissez-faire approach should be adopted during periods of economic panic, while a restrictive approach should be adopted during prosperous periods.

<h3>Japan Adopts Streamlined Trains</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) 1935 marks the era of streamlined practicality. The Ministry of Railways is using projectile-shaped streamlined gasoline trains, currently being rushed into production by Kawasaki Shipbuilding Company. Each train costs 36,000 yuan, is 20 meters long, with sharp, elongated front and rear sections resembling projectiles. It is equipped with a 150-horsepower engine, achieving an average speed of 85 kilometers per hour and a maximum speed of 120 kilometers per hour, making it the fastest land transportation in Japan, reaching world-class speed standards.

<h3>League of Nations Decides Italy and Abyssinia to Negotiate Directly</h3>
<p>Approves Austria's Debt Issuance to Develop Public Works</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a brief closed-door meeting at 10:35 this morning, chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Ruştu, deciding to allow Italy and Abyssinia to negotiate directly. The meeting adjourned at 11:55. (11th, Guomin dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 84th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened this morning. The initial session was held in private, with the League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol presenting a report stating that Abyssinia has not yet requested that the dispute between the country and Italy be placed on the agenda. According to well-informed sources, the Abyssinian government has taken this passive stance because Italy and Abyssinia are currently engaged in negotiations. The Administrative Council then held a public meeting, chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Ruştu, who expressed condolences for the passing of the late judge of the International Court of Justice at The Hague, the Japanese Adachi Mineichiro. British Foreign Secretary Simon and French representative Massigli immediately expressed their sympathy. The Administrative Council then proceeded with routine business, including the recognition of the Russian chargé d'affaires in France, Rosengoltz, as Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on Monday morning. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The regular meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council will be held tomorrow. A closed-door meeting will be held first thing tomorrow morning to discuss the issue of the conflict between Italian and Abyssinian troops raised by Abyssinia in Africa. If Abyssinia sends a representative to attend the Administrative Council at that time, this issue will be placed on the agenda of the Administrative Council. In addition, the first day of the Administrative Council meeting will mainly be limited to administrative issues of the League of Nations and the issues of refugees from Russia, Armenia, and Assyria. Other important international political issues will not be developed on the first day of the meeting. However, when France and Italy signed an agreement in Rome a few days ago, sources said that there was a possibility of resuming disarmament negotiations. This statement has now been confirmed. Representatives of major countries attending the Administrative Council have come to Geneva accompanied by qualified disarmament experts. It is conceivable that most of the discussions outside the Administrative Council meeting will involve the political aspects of disarmament issues. (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome King Emmanuel and Prime Minister Mussolini both declared to the Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires in Italy that the Italian government is very willing to reach a peaceful resolution on the demarcation of the Italian-Abyssinian border as soon as possible. It is reported that Italy will send personnel to Geneva in the coming days, with the mission of explaining Italy's views on the border issue. The Italian delegation will have instructions to adopt a moderate attitude. It is also reported that General Tapono, who is now departing from Rome to take up the post of Governor-General of Italian East Africa, has been instructed by the government to make every effort to establish friendly relations with Abyssinia. The League of Nations has convened a meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council at the request of the Abyssinian government to consider the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. Many worry that this move by Abyssinia may hinder direct negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia. However, judging from current news, the Italian government has adopted a patient attitude, so there is hope for a peaceful resolution. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The proceedings of the last meeting of the League of Nations Mandates Commission will be reported to the League of Nations Administrative Council by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš. However, there will be no difficulties regarding the issue of Japan's mandate over the Pacific Islands. No one wants to raise the discussion caused by Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The League of Nations Covenant does not stipulate that the mandatory must be a member of the League of Nations. If Japan continues to report on the mandate situation to the Mandates Commission, Japan can still carry out its obligations in accordance with the mandate system. (10th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Protectorate Committee decided in principle today to allow Austria to issue debt of 100 million Austrian schillings to develop domestic public works. (11th, Guomin dispatch)</p>

The next meeting of the Little Entente's Permanent Political Conference is scheduled to be held at the end of February. (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Saar General Election Tomorrow, Europe Reveals Signs of Unease</h3>
<p>France, Italy, and Austria Deploy Troops on the Border</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Voters Enter the Saar</p>
<p>(London) As the date of the Saar plebiscite approaches, governments across Europe are showing signs of unease. According to reliable sources, the Austrian and Italian governments are on high alert, fearing that unexpected incidents may follow the German victory in the Saar. It is reported that Italian troops are now heavily concentrated on the Austrian border. If the German National Socialist Party attempts to stage an uprising in Austria after the Saar plebiscite, Italian troops will intervene to deal with it. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French military authorities are carrying out large-scale defense work on the Saar border for the Saar vote on Sunday. Eleven mobile gendarmerie teams and vehicles are distributed at key locations, and 48 tax police teams are serving as reserves. (10th, Guomin dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar 665 Dutch and Swiss civil servants serving as chairmen of various polling stations have arrived here by special train and car, without incident en route. (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar Sixty more South American Saarlanders arrived yesterday to participate in the plebiscite. More than 50,000 people are coming from Germany tomorrow specifically for this matter. It is expected that there will be a grand welcome, and maintaining order will be very difficult. Those who arrived yesterday were greeted with various slogans, some shouting "Long live Hitler," some calling for maintaining the status quo, and others singing the Internationale. Among those arriving tomorrow are German envoy to Vienna, Papen, and his wife, because they reside in the Saar and are therefore eligible to vote. Although the German Front paid for the travel expenses of overseas voters, some of them claimed that they intended to vote against returning the Saar to Germany. One voter returned from Japan. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar The German Front today ordered supporters of Germany to decorate their homes with lights tomorrow night for recognition, but the opposition immediately ordered the opposition to do the same. The plebiscite committee has now arranged for the announcement of the voting results. At that time, the Wauberg Hall will use radio to announce the results to eight European countries, and then journalists will be allowed to transmit the voting process to the outside by telegraph or telephone. The purpose of the authorities using radio to broadcast the voting results is to allow people to listen at home, so as to avoid crowds gathering in the streets. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar It is rumored that the plebiscite committee has decided on a new method for counting votes, which will begin around 5:00 pm on Sunday and be revealed at 8:00 am on Tuesday. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Heads of Polling Stations Sworn In</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar A total of 901 election stations have been set up throughout the Saar region for the plebiscite, each with a head. Among them, 300 are Swiss, 350 are Dutch, 230 are from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and the rest belong to the people of various neutral countries. This morning, 901 heads were sworn in at the Waldburg Assembly Hall here. The entire Plebiscite Committee attended to supervise the oath. The chairman of the committee, Swedish citizen Rohde, made a brief speech, followed by dividing into three groups. The Swiss heads swore before Swiss member Henry, the Dutch heads swore before Dutch member de Jong, and the Luxembourg and other national heads swore before Rohde, saying, "I swear to perform the power I have accepted with honor and conscience." There were no witnesses present at the time of the oath. After the ceremony, the heads returned to the assembly hall. The chairman of the committee, Rohde, ordered all reporters and photographers to leave, and then issued instructions. According to general knowledge, the content of these instructions is to take preventive measures to ensure that the vote is kept secret and no fraud occurs, and to request military police intervention if necessary.

<h3>German Side Prepares to Celebrate</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar As the date of the Saar regional plebiscite draws nearer, the political mood of the Saar people is becoming increasingly tense. Although no serious clashes have occurred in recent days, minor incidents have occurred frequently. The sharp confrontation between the pro-German and pro-status quo factions can be seen here. Yesterday, several newspaper vendors of a pro-status quo newspaper were beaten by National Socialists on the street, one of whom lost an eye. In the afternoon, a group of Saarlanders residing in the United States arrived here, and the National Socialists took the opportunity to hold a demonstration. If the police had not intervened, a serious fight would have broken out. As the voting date approaches, the National Socialists have doubled their efforts in propaganda. Relying on their large number, they intimidate the small number of pro-status quo supporters who are unwilling to express opposition to the current system. The National Socialists do not hesitate to use terrorist tactics. The pro-German faction is very confident of victory in the voting results. The German Front has posted notices everywhere, preparing to celebrate the return of the Saar region to Germany. The squares are filled with piles of pine branches for decoration, and residents have prepared bamboo poles to hang celebratory flags. Today, another large group of voters will arrive here from Germany by special train. It is generally expected that the National Socialists will take the opportunity to hold a large-scale demonstration. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pro-French Posters Discovered</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar Yesterday, huge pro-French posters suddenly appeared on major streets, saying that if the residents of the Saar wish to maintain the status quo, France will not stand in the way. If the residents wish to retain the French franc currency and market, France is willing to accept them happily. France guarantees all rights, without distinction of race, language, or opinion. France is a land of freedom and humanity, etc. Those who saw it were shocked. The police then tore it down on the order of their superiors, but soon the plebiscite committee ordered them not to tear it down, because it was rumored that it was posted by the pro-French faction. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French authorities firmly believe that if the voting results are favorable to Germany, a large number of people will leave the Saar for France. Therefore, the French border guards have been ordered to transport these immigrants to the French interior immediately upon their arrival in France. The number of immigrants allowed to reside in the Moselle province is limited to 3,000, and they must be descendants of French citizens or have obtained French citizenship. For the safety of these expatriates, the French authorities have made detailed preparations. The whole country can accommodate 40,000 expatriates. It is said that these expatriates who must move into France after the vote are the separatist communists and terrorists. Their actions in the Saar have been deeply dissatisfied with the local people, so it is necessary to relocate them for good. (10th, Guomin dispatch)</p>
<h3>Committee's Ban</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Saar Voting Committee said that it has issued a new order prohibiting special trains from Germany to the Saar from hanging flags and posting slogans inside and outside the train when entering the Saar territory. This news was broadcast on German radio tonight, because tomorrow there will be a special train carrying 3,300 people from Berlin and other places to the Saar for voting. (10th, Guomin dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar The Saar Governing Commission today ordered that only official postal flights and aircraft officially authorized shall be allowed to fly over the Saar during the plebiscite period from January 11 to 15. All others are prohibited from flying. It is reported that the commission has obtained the consent of the German government in advance. (10th, Guomin dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar The Saar Regional Plebiscite Committee has requested France and Germany to stop radio propaganda from tonight. The French government has replied by telegram that it will no longer use radio propaganda, but on the condition that Germany do the same. The German Commissioner for Saar Affairs, Burkell, replied today, saying that because the French Strasbourg radio station broadcast speeches by the leaders of the Saar region and the National Socialist Front, Voigt and Ploumh, on January 6, he would not agree to accept the restriction of stopping radio propaganda. Therefore, French radio propaganda will continue and cannot be stopped. (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Because the Saar regional plebiscite is about to be held, all German radio stations will broadcast propaganda songs tonight, the song title is "The Saar is Germany's Saar." (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Visits German Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>(Berlin) British Ambassador to Berlin, Sir Phipps, visited German Foreign Minister Neurath today and asked him to attend a special meeting of the League of Nations after the Saar vote, because Germany is still a member of the League of Nations in law. The German Foreign Minister replied that since Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations on its own initiative, it cannot participate in the League of Nations meeting again for fundamental principles. Neurath also said that according to various reports, the issue of the permanent affiliation of the Saar still needs to be decided by the League of Nations meeting, which Germany does not approve of. This kind of unnecessary delay will inevitably affect the economic interests of the region. (10th, Guomin dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is expected that the Saar issue will be handled soon. The simplicity or complexity of the procedure of the Administrative Council depends entirely on the results of the plebiscite. If all districts vote in favor of returning the territory to Germany or maintaining the status quo, the matter will be easy to handle. If one district votes this way and another district votes that way, the issue will become more complicated and the resolution will have to be delayed. However, this is the final step, because everyone from top to bottom wants to settle the Saar issue as soon as possible. The British government suggested that Germany should send a representative to participate in the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. Although the German government is grateful for the friendly spirit of the United Kingdom, Berlin critics said that if it is solely for the principle involved, the German government's refusal to participate is very appropriate. The reporter of the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung said that Germany's passive attitude towards Geneva is because the League of Nations cannot recognize Germany's demand for equality of rights. Germany has no need to attend the Administrative Council meeting now, because the meeting will only discuss the purely formal resolution on the Saar issue. The reporter of the Berliner Tageblatt said that Germany's refusal to attend may be out of a desire not to express anything about the rumors that Germany will return to the League of Nations. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>France-Italy Rome Agreement What Austria Looks Forward To</h3>
<p>Austrian Foreign Minister Issues Declaration</p>
<p>(Vienna) Austrian Foreign Minister Weidg recently issued a declaration to a Havas reporter, saying that the work recently completed in Rome by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval is very important from both a European and Central European perspective. This kind of work is what we have been looking forward to day and night. The Rome Agreement is enough to give the lasting understanding between Italy and Yugoslavia a solid hope, and the same is true for Hungary and Yugoslavia. Once the convention of mutual non-interference in internal affairs is established, the right to asylum for political prisoners can have a limitation agreed upon by all countries, and will not be abused. The result of the Rome Agreement will first be the separate conclusion of bilateral agreements by the countries of Central Europe, and then enter the stage of mutual consultation in the event of an emergency. If so, it is equivalent to the establishment of a new Vienna Conference, and Europe will obtain lasting peace. We do not believe that the Pan-European policy has the possibility of realization at present, but an economic Pan-European alliance can definitely be gradually realized in the future. This must be based on the France-Italy agreement. It is for this reason that the close relationship between France and Italy is worth celebrating. Finally, Weidg said that he will visit Paris with Prime Minister Schuschnigg in February. (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Prime Minister Schuschnigg gave a long speech to various dignitaries today, talking about various issues of domestic and foreign policy. The situation during the speech was very secret. The attendees were dignitaries from all walks of life in Austria, such as Vienna Archbishop Innitzer, cabinet members, several governors, and dignitaries from the church and academia. The topic of the Prime Minister's speech was "Austria and Europe, Austria and Germany." In addition, there were domestic issues, and the main conditions for restoring normal relations between Germany and Austria seemed to be the main purpose of the Prime Minister's speech. The full text of the speech will be published in a press release. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The international political reporter of the Paris Echo, the organ of the French General Staff, Mr. Bodina, today disclosed in an important position in the newspaper an article on German-French armament issues, stating that French Foreign Minister Laval had obtained the approval of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome that French armaments must be superior to Germany, but this section seems less important than its appearance shows, because the most important point is that British Foreign Secretary Simon agreed to cancel the diplomatic note of the former French Foreign Minister Barthou on April 17 of last year in the talks with Flandin and Laval on December 12. When Flandin and Laval talked with the British Foreign Secretary, they also agreed to allow Germany's rearmament in principle to be considered legitimate after certain conditions were attached. However, Laval's move has clearly fallen into bottomless negotiations, and without the consent of the Supreme Military Council in advance, it will stalemate the French armament issue. Bodina also said that the actual value of Italy's approval of French armaments being superior to Germany must wait until the issues of management and sanction are determined before it can be seen, but it is only a fantasy to hope that management and sanction can succeed today.

<h3>Japanese Consul Suma Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>Returns to Post in the South Today</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Consul-General in Beijing, Suma, was previously summoned back to Japan with Japanese military attaché in Beijing, Suzuki, to receive face-to-face instructions on Japan's diplomatic strategy towards China. Suma arrived in Beiping this morning. The Japanese embassy's chargé d'affaires, Wakasugi, and others, were all at the station to welcome him. Suma went to the Japanese embassy and immediately convened a meeting of all staff members. Security was tight and the meeting did not disperse until 12:00. Suma told Chinese reporters that he and military attaché Suzuki had returned to Japan for two weeks of vacation. He came to Beiping to visit old friends and did not have any mission. Reports that he came to Beiping to convey the Japanese government's diplomatic policy towards North China are absolutely untrue. When someone asked Suma what the recent situation of Sino-Japanese diplomacy was, he said that reports that Japan's diplomacy towards China had changed from "Mizutori diplomacy" to "woodpecker diplomacy" were completely rumors and not credible. Japanese ambassador Arimasa has also not returned to Japan recently. Because of the limited time in Beiping, he has no time to meet Huang. (11th, Special dispatch)</p>

<h3>New Siberian Railway (Vladivostok Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Developing Coal, Iron, and Oil</p>
<p>Establishing Military Transportation</p>
<p>The industrial development order of advanced industrialized nations generally starts with light industry, as was the case with England. Similarly, the industrial advancement of less developed industrial countries also progresses from light industry to heavy industry, as seen in Japan. This is because light industry focuses on the production of daily necessities for the people, making it easier to find markets for these products both domestically and abroad, leading to profitable individual operations. The Soviet Union is an exception. From the beginning of the first five-year plan, it concentrated all its efforts on heavy industry. Now, the European part of the Soviet Union is quite developed. For example, pig iron production is projected to be over 10 million tons in 1934, ranking second in the world, only after the United States, and five times more than Japan. Steel production is estimated to be over 9.3 million tons in 1934, surpassing England, but still lower than the United States and Germany, yet two and a half times that of Japan.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is not satisfied with this. Developing only the European part of the country is insufficient, especially since its industrial construction goal is to reach the level of the most prosperous United States in 1929, using the U.S. heavy industry as a benchmark. Now that the first five-year plan is largely completed and the second five-year plan has begun, Siberia, especially Eastern Siberia, cannot be ignored. To develop it, the existing Siberian Railway, even with double tracks, is still not enough. Furthermore, the vast plains in the northern region contain extremely rich deposits of coal, iron, oil, gold, and other minerals.</p>
<p>According to recent surveys, the Bureya coal mine has reserves of 500 billion tons, and the iron ore in the southern part of the Lesser Khingan Range has reserves of 420 million tons. Combining these two major mining areas could form a massive metallurgical industrial complex, known as the "Bureya-Loso Troitsky" region. There is also oil north of Lake Baikal, connected to the oil fields in northern Sakhalin Island, and gold mines near Botapo and in the middle reaches of the Zeya River. These are all special products of Eastern Siberia, enough to make it prosperous and open up new areas in the future. However, the Siberian Railway cannot accomplish this task, and even building branch lines from the Ussuri Railway is insufficient.</p>
<p>Therefore, this autumn, planning began to start from "Tayshet," west of Irkutsk, passing through Bratsk, Botapo, the plains north of Lake Tunguska, crossing the Aldan River, and going through Chunta to Nikolayevsk-on-Amur (庙街) at the mouth of the Amur River. Another plan involves following the same route to "Chunta" and then turning southeast, passing through the aforementioned Bureya-Loso Troitsky industrial area, crossing the Amur River, and ending at Sovetskaya Gavan (蘇維特灣). There are three branch lines: one connecting along the Amur River with Khabarovsk (伯力), one passing through the coal and iron area to "Bilakan" (畢拉干), and one from Chunta to Tynda (塔虎德米格搭), the center of the Amur Railway. The total length of this route is over 1,800 kilometers, and the three branch lines are 720 kilometers long, collectively named the BAM (Baikal-Amur Mainline) railway. It bypasses "Baikal" and "Magistralny," taking the first letter of each place name. The most difficult aspect of the route is the sparse population and insufficient supplies. The Soviet government has started transporting tens of thousands of semi-forced laborers to that area, building temporary housing, and encouraging people to live in that area for development. People who go to that area receive considerable preferential treatment.</p>
<p>The industrial significance, as briefly described above, demonstrates its importance, but the actual content is more than that. The Soviet Union's hypothetical international enemy in the Far East is well-known. In case of an emergency, there are only about 200,000 troops stationed from Chita to Vladivostok. Such a long route and such a vast wilderness make it very difficult to transport troops from Europe, requiring a journey of more than ten days. The opponent, however, has much greater convenience. Therefore, they believe that the connection between the Amur Railway and the Ussuri Railway is likely to be attacked, and they cannot guarantee the speed and safety of military transport. However, the Soviet Union is determined to defend its territory and maintain its natural resources. Therefore, the Siberian Railway cannot fully bear this task. Hence, the ABM (sic) railway project is planned to be completed in two more winters. Currently, the aforementioned three branch lines are being constructed first, with the line from Chunta to Tynda being completed first. Work has also started along the Amur River to Khabarovsk. The progress of the project is difficult for outsiders to understand because it is military in nature. In short, the ABM (sic) railway has particularly significant meaning. (December 30th)</p>

At the airfield, soldiers from the Second Division of Guan Linzheng's troops and the 716th and 646th Regiments of Shang Zhen's 32nd Army set up posts. At 3:30 PM, amidst cheers from the crowd, the ceremony was declared complete. The various aspects of the event are detailed below:</p>
<p>Attendance: Attendees included over a hundred representatives from the Political Readjustment Committee (政整會) (Zhang Jianchu), the Military Sub-Committee (军分会) (Xu Ying), the City Party Headquarters (Chen Shiquan), the Provincial Party Headquarters (Chen Fangxian), the Chamber of Commerce (Leng Jiaji), the Director of the Health Bureau (Fang Guji), and the President of Chaoyang University (Jiang Yong). Representatives from various schools and organizations numbered about 3,000, and over a thousand citizens participated freely. In total, the number of attendees was over 5,000.</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: A rostrum was set up in front of the China National Aviation Corporation warehouse at Nanyuan Airfield. To the left of the rostrum was a lounge and a decorated archway with a banner that read, "Donating Money to Buy Aircraft is an Expression of the People's National Salvation," in powerful calligraphy. The entrance to the venue had a decorated archway with the words "Naming and Presentation Ceremony of Aircraft Donated by the Citizens of Peiping City." The airfield was guarded by various units stationed at Nanyuan, and police officers from the Fourth Security Team and the Southern Suburb Police were stationed in front of the gate.</p>
<p>Appearance of the Five Aircraft: The five aircraft were lined up in front of the rostrum. The fuselages were yellow, and the names of the manufacturers were on the tails. Soldiers from the Fourth Security Team guarded the front and rear of the aircraft. Red silk ribbons were tied to the rear of the aircraft for the five elders to cut during the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The attending crowd eagerly admired the majestic appearance of the five aircraft.</p>
<p>Arrival of the Five Elders: The five elders invited by the donation association to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony were Jiang Han (79 years old), Xu Fuhai (85 years old), Zhou Shanfu (80 years old), Feng Zhuxuan (82 years old), and Zhang Xiuran (70 years old). They arrived by car at 12:45 PM, escorted by receptionists from the association. They rested in the lounge. The elders were in good spirits, walked strongly, had a kind demeanor, and spoke gently, which inspired reverence from the crowd.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: At 12:50 PM, Mayor Yuan Liang arrived. Preparations were immediately made to begin the ceremony. Guests gathered below the rostrum. The chairman of the ceremony, Yuan Liang, Central Government representative Huang Bingheng, members of the City Party Headquarters Chen Shiquan, Xiao Xun, and Xu Xiaoyan, member of the Provincial Party Headquarters Chen Fangxian, representative of the Chamber of Commerce Leng Jiaji, and members of the donation association Wu Chengshi and Yu Shiyuan were all seated on the rostrum. The Public Security Bureau band played music on the side of the rostrum. After performing the rituals, Yuan Liang delivered the opening speech.</p>
<p>Yuan Liang's Speech: He stated that today's naming ceremony of the five aircraft dedicated to the Central Government by Peiping City was honored by the presence of Director Huang Bingheng, dispatched from the Central Government to accept the donation. Mr. Huang is a pioneer in the aviation industry and a first-class figure in Chinese aviation. This proves the importance the Central Government attaches to this matter. He expressed his gratitude to Mr. Huang for his visit and his respect to the Central Government. He also thanked Captain Gao Zhihang of the Air Force for leading his aircraft to participate in the grand ceremony on behalf of all the citizens of the city. Next, Wu Chenghuang, a standing committee member of the donation association, gave a detailed report on the process of purchasing the aircraft. Then, guest speakers gave speeches.</p>
<p>Ribbon-Cutting and Naming: After the speeches, Mayor Yuan Liang led the five elders to the rear of the five aircraft to prepare for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Amidst the sound of firecrackers and music, the solemn ribbon-cutting ceremony was successfully completed. The five aircraft were piloted by Air Force Captain Gao Zhihang, Deputy Captain Liu Cuigang, and team members Hao Hongzao, Li Kezhi, Dong Mingde, and Yu Tianmin, who boarded the aircraft in preparation for takeoff. At the same time, the names of the five aircraft were announced as "Peiping City No. 1," "Peiping City No. 2," "Peiping City No. 3," "Peiping City No. 4," and "Peiping City No. 5." After the announcement, the entire venue applauded.</p>
<p>Presentation Ceremony: Immediately following, the presentation ceremony was held. Mayor Yuan Liang read the presentation certificate, bowed, and handed it to Central Government representative Huang Bingheng. The Central Government representative then awarded medals and read out the certificates of commendation, which were accepted by Mayor Yuan Liang. After the ceremony, Huang delivered a speech of thanks.</p>
<p>Various Performances: The ceremony ended at 2:00 PM. The aircraft attached to the string troop performed a flight demonstration, first circling the airfield three times, then entering the city and circling the airspace of Peiping three times before landing simultaneously at Nanyuan Airfield. While the five aircraft were entering the city, Air Force Captain Gao Zhihang piloted one aircraft alone, performing novel maneuvers in the airspace above the airfield, going straight up and down, flipping left and right, hovering briefly like a dragonfly touching water, and then pausing like an eagle watching. His flying skills were superb, and the crowd cheered enthusiastically, especially the students, who were even more enthusiastic, taking off their hats, jumping, and shouting slogans such as "Aviation Saves the Nation" and "China Will Not Perish." Gao performed in the air for half an hour and then landed. The crowd congratulated him. He then went to the stage to shake hands with Mayor Yuan Liang and pay his respects to Central Government representative Huang Bingheng. At 2:45 PM, the five aircraft landed. The five aircraft returned to their unit. After the five aircraft finished their performance, it was already 3:30 PM. The entire group took a photo and dispersed. All sectors have scheduled a propaganda meeting for aviation saving the country at Zhongshan Park at 10:00 AM tomorrow (9th). Central Government representative Huang Bingheng, Captain Gao Zhihang, and others will attend. After the meeting, Gao will lead the five aircraft to leave Peiping and return to their unit, following the Jinpu Railway line south, passing through Tianjin, Jinan, Xuzhou, and other places, landing to refuel as needed. Huang will leave Peiping and return to Beijing within the day to report on his mission. (8th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Water Conservancy Expert Nien Hoph and Others Arrive in Bian (Kaifeng)</h3>
<p>Yellow River Conservancy Commission Hosts Welcome Banquet</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: League of Nations water conservancy experts Nien Hoph, Hode, assistant Ge Ximo, and specialists sent by the National Economic Council Pu Deli, Zhang Jiong, and Zhang Xinyuan, a group of six people, arrived at the station at 10:00 PM on the 8th. They were greeted by Secretary-General Zhang Hanying, Chief Engineer An Lisen, Chen Ruzhen, Rong Jin, and others from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. The Jintai Hotel on Gulou Street was selected as their temporary residence. This morning (9th) at 10:00 AM, Mr. Nien and others went to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to meet with Chairman Li Yizhi. The water conservancy experts gathered to discuss and were very pleased. It is reported that the Yellow River Conservancy Commission prepared both Chinese and English reports (the Chinese report is titled "Overview and Exploration of the Yellow River") and about 20 planning charts. Chairman Li also sought the opinions of the experts on important issues discovered during the Yellow River water conservancy project and architectural design, discussing them in detail until noon. The commission then sent personnel to guide the experts to visit the surveying and mapping departments for a week. It is reported that the commission has drafted a travel itinerary for the experts to inspect the Yellow River after arriving in Bian. However, since water conservancy expert Womodu and assistant Sadoli departed from Tianjin on the evening of the 9th and will arrive in Bian on the 10th, the date of departure for inspecting the Yellow River will be determined after Mr. Wo arrives in Bian. It is also reported that the commission has prepared dinner at the meeting hall tonight (9th) at 6:00 PM to entertain the experts, and has invited Chairman Liu, the heads of various provincial departments, Provincial Government Secretary-General Fang Qidao, and Commissioners Chang Zhizhen and Li Jingzhai, as well as Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Labor Relief Group, to accompany them.

<h3>Songjiang Plans to Dredge the Changshan River</h3>
<p>The Xijiao Bridge and Tan area is where rice shops and bran cake industries are located. The huge annual turnover accounts for two-thirds of the county. However, in recent years, due to the Changshan River being silted up, ships from the four villages cannot reach Songjiang directly, which also makes irrigation of farmland difficult. Farmers and merchants in the Songjin counties in the river basin have been asking for dredging for a long time. Now, the county magistrates of Songjin counties have discussed the dredging plan, which requires an estimated cost of 11,000 yuan. Song County will bear 7,000 yuan, and Jin County will raise 4,000 yuan. It is planned to start construction in the middle of the first lunar month. It is reported that this county has raised a sum of 5,000 yuan, which is still 2,000 yuan short. The county government has invited the bran cake industry to raise funds to make this happen.</p>
<h3>Department of Civil Affairs Sends Personnel to Inspect General Affairs</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs believes that local general affairs are crucial to the national economy and people's livelihood and should be inspected by personnel to promote them. Luo Ailin was specially sent to this county to investigate accumulated grains, people's livelihood factories, relief homes, public and private charitable organizations, and hospitals. The committee should draft plans for improvement and rectification regarding how to improve general affairs, how to enrich the content, how to economize expenses, how to increase efficiency, how to reorganize the factories already in operation, and how to plan and set up factories that have not yet been set up. The report will be submitted to the committee for verification.</p>
<h3>Changshu Rural Farmers Request Power Supply</h3>
<p>The electricity plant in this county was previously resolved by the Jiangsu Provincial Electricity Association to allow rural areas to use electricity to irrigate fields. Since October last year, it has been adding rural lines. From east to Hupu and west to Dayiqiao, power has been supplied for lighting. In addition, expansion is still underway. Now, Wu Bofan, the mayor of Meili Town, and others have requested that the Wujiasi Temple and Sijingqiao area in the northern part of Meili, not far from the town, has more than 200 households and more than 5,000 mu of farmland. The commercial market is developed, and there are flower shops and lace factories that need a lot of electricity. Therefore, they have specially requested the district office to forward a letter to the electricity plant to extend the lines to the Wujiasi Temple area to facilitate future agricultural irrigation needs. After the second district chief forwarded the letter to the plant, the plant has sent engineer Huang Zhenxia to the countryside to investigate and consider adding poles for expansion.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Winter Feels Like Summer, Broad Beans Bear Fruit</h3>
<p>Since last month, the weather in this county has been unusually warm, as if it were the climate of late winter. Vegetables in the rural fields have mostly bloomed. The broad beans planted by Chen Rongchang, a farmer in Gaobang'an Village in the 18th district of the northern township, have all bloomed. Also, the peas in the fields of a farmer named Peng in the township have already borne fruit. In addition, the broad beans planted in the sunny areas of the fields near Dongda'an in the Liutanqiao area of the fifth district have also borne fruit. The early wheat stalks are also mostly stout, no different from the wheat stalks in mid-March. Winter feels like summer, and the plants are abnormal, which has not been seen in previous years.</p>
<h3>Two Male Corpses with Gunshot Wounds Found in the Western Suburbs</h3>
<p>On the barren mound at Shuigoutou near Yinglong Bridge outside the West Gate, two unnamed male corpses with gunshot wounds were suddenly found yesterday morning (11th). Both male corpses were about twenty years old. The corpses were several feet apart. One corpse was wearing a blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers and yellow basketball shoes. There was a gunshot hole in the right side of the head. The other corpse was wearing a gray cotton-padded jacket and trousers and a black short coat, with a peaked cap on its head. There was a gunshot hole next to the right ear. The corpse was kneeling on the ground, covered in blood, a very tragic sight. Chen Zizhao, the head of the 227th Tu, reported the case to the local branch court, requesting an investigation. At the same time, the Detective Team of the County Public Security Bureau and the Fourth Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau in charge of the area dispatched police to investigate. Two ownerless firewood boats were found on the nearby riverbank. On the boats, there was a rattan basket containing galoshes, belts, files, and Gongzhe No. 142 of the Shenxin No. 3 Yarn Factory. These were all seized for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Inspection of the Total Amount of Old Stamp Duty Registered</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce has handled the old stamp duty registration for various industries, which was due to end at the end of December of the tenth year. The number and types of public associations, shops, and stamps were separately calculated and listed, with a total amount of 15,745.45 yuan. Yesterday, together with Wu Naiqing, a representative of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, Zhu Fangjian, a representative of the county government, and representatives of various relevant industries, they were jointly inspected. The original sealed packages of old stamp duty were stamped and temporarily sealed and stored in the Chamber of Commerce. After the Ministry of Finance determines the replacement method, it will be processed again. The situation has been reported separately.</p>
<h3>Ministry Approves Standards for Business Tax Assessment</h3>
<p>The Wine and Soy Sauce Shop Association of Wuxi City believes that the industry has always relied on hot wine as its main business, and has already paid the wine license tax. However, the business tax bureau has repeatedly sent personnel to the stores to investigate and estimate, arbitrarily combining the large amount of wine with the retail sales of small items for assessment, forcing them to pay business tax, resulting in double taxation. In order to avoid disputes and alleviate commercial difficulties, they have specially telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request an explanation. A reply was received yesterday: "Received the report, checked and found that for shops that mainly engage in tobacco and alcohol and also operate other goods, if the main business part has already paid the tobacco and alcohol license tax, the business tax should be excluded and exempted. The other part that is also operated should still pay business tax to show the difference. If the annual turnover of each store is less than 1,000 yuan, it can be exempted from tax in accordance with the regulations." The association has received the telegram and has passed it on to various stores for compliance.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Abduction Case Occurs in the Southeastern Countryside of Danyang</h3>
<p>Xu, a villager in Shicun Township in the seventh district of the county, is a small wealthy family and has long been coveted by bandits. At about 10:00 PM the night before, several bandits suddenly rushed into the house, speaking in a northern accent and armed with weapons. They imprisoned Xu's entire family in a room, not allowing them to make a sound. They then looted the house. Before leaving, they abducted a six-year-old boy. Also, the home of a farmer Jing near Huangtang was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits last night, all armed with weapons. They rushed into the house, forbade them to make a sound, ransacked the house everywhere, plundered wealth, and fled without a trace.</p>
<h3>All Sectors in Zhenjiang Province Held a Meeting Yesterday to Commemorate the Late Madam Xu Tang</h3>
<p>Local figures from Zhenjiang and important figures from the provincial capital's party and government held a grand memorial meeting yesterday to commemorate the late Madam Xu Tang's donation of land for education and her contribution to society. The meeting place was the lecture hall in the park. Participants included Chairman Chen, Director Yu, Director Tao, Director Zhao, Director Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and secretaries and section chiefs from various departments, as well as Hong Lanyou and others from the Central Government, Huang Renzhi, Yang Weiyu, and Jiang Wenyu from the vocational education field, and local figures such as Leng Yuqiu, Lu Xiaobo, and Yan Huiyu. After 9:00 AM, the bell rang to start the meeting. First, they bowed three times to the portrait and observed three minutes of silence. Then, the chief mourner, Leng Yuqiu, presented a wreath on behalf of the attendees. Wu Suoyuan read the eulogy. Leng Yuqiu gave a speech, and Yu Jingtang reported on the deeds. Chairman Chen, Huang Renzhi, Hong Lanyou, and others gave speeches. Hong Lanyou proposed (1) requesting the government to commend her in the name of the conference, and (2) collecting the words and deeds of the late madam for local records or provincial annals to interview. The whole room unanimously passed the proposals. The first item was handled by the China Vocational Education Society. For the second item, Yin Shigong was asked to collect and write the first draft. Finally, Xu Jieshen, a member of the Shan family, expressed his gratitude. The music played, and the meeting ended. Special Report</p>
<h3>Review of the World Economy in 1934 (Continued-2) by Mu Ouchu</h3>
<p>The prices of livestock products have also fallen very commonly, with almost no difference between countries. Now, the comparison of the wholesale prices of livestock products in the British market on April 12, 1934, and the same day in 1933 is as follows:</p>
<p>1933 1934</p>
<p>Argentine Beef 3 shillings 6 pence - 4 shillings 3 shillings 4 pence - 3 shillings 8 pence</p>
<p>British Pork 5 shillings - 5 shillings 8 pence 5 shillings 6 pence - 6 shillings 6 pence</p>
<p>Danish Cured Pork 68 shillings - 74 shillings 79 shillings</p>
<p>Danish Butter 90 shillings - 91 shillings 84 shillings</p>
<p>Canadian Cheese 60 shillings - 68 shillings 50 shillings - 58 shillings</p>
<p>(According to the World Economic Yearbook, First Quarter Report, 1934, page 23)</p>
<p>Although the above figures cannot be used as an absolute standard, they can show a glimpse of the agricultural panic. Naturally, the prices of some goods are high. Furthermore, the changes in the prices of major commodities are listed as follows:</p>
<p>New York Cotton New York Raw Silk Chicago Wheat</p>
<p>Per pound Per pound Per Bushel (8 gallons)</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Highest Lowest Highest Lowest</p>
<p>Cents Cents Dollars Dollars Cents Cents</p>
<p>1932 9.20 5.70 1.91 1.10 6.40 43 7/8</p>
<p>1933 11.75 5.90 2.21 1.10 1.60 44 5/8</p>
<p>April to October 1934 12.66 11.76 13.05 12.07 98.3 88.0</p>
<p>(From "Where is the World Going?" Second half of 1934, page 72)</p>
<p>The fall in cocoon prices has been mentioned earlier. As for the rise in cotton prices, it is artificial and should not be seen as a sign of improvement. Both the "Production Reduction Agreement" and "Production Reduction" are facts of artificial price increases.</p>
<p>Since the commodity market is artificially embellished, it naturally affects prices. Therefore, last year, the prices in various countries showed a gradual upward trend, especially in Japan and the United States. The changes in prices in major countries are as follows: (1913 = 100)</p>
<p>Japan England United States Germany France</p>
<p>1932 Highest 139.5 92.2 81.7 100.1 87.0</p>
<p>Lowest 110.6 80.9 71.5 92.0 79.0</p>
<p>1933 Highest 139.8 89.9 98.3 96.1 81.0</p>
<p>Lowest 133.2 82.3 69.0 91.0 78.0</p>
<p>1934 Highest 135.4 92.3 102.8 100.4 79.0</p>
<p>(Up to September) Lowest 131.5 89.5 97.8 95.8 73.0</p>
<p>In nine months, the United States averaged 100.3, a significant increase compared to 83.6 in 1933. However, it is still far from Roosevelt's attempt to return to the 1926 level of 141.4. The highest in the United Kingdom was 92.3, also a significant increase from the previous year and the highest record since 1931. The highest in Japan was 135.4, slightly lower than the highest number in the previous year, but still a relatively high number since 1931. The exception is France, which maintains the gold standard and is lower than the previous year. The highest in Germany was 100.4, also higher than the previous year. However, the decline in France is due to the gold standard. If currency and gold prices are converted, then the decline in France is not as significant as the numbers recorded in the table.</p>
<p>From these price index fluctuations, we can also see the general situation of the world panic over the past year.</p>
<p>With the deepening of the panic, various countries will inevitably face financial crises and financial disturbances. This phenomenon was even more evident in 1934. Because of the urgency of war preparations in various countries, regardless of financial difficulties, they still do not hesitate to pay huge military expenditures. We can see the urgency of the war situation by taking a look at the amount of military spending in various countries.</p>
<p>Japan United Kingdom United States</p>
<p>Military Expenditure Percentage of Expenditure Military Expenditure Percentage of Expenditure Military Expenditure Percentage of Expenditure</p>
<p>1930-31 443 28.4% 111 13. and % 19.7%</p>
<p>1931-1932 454 30.7% 108 14.0% 825 16.5%</p>
<p>1932-33 687 35.2% 103 13.3% 791 15.4%</p>
<p>1933-34 873 38.7% 109 15.7% 716 10.0%</p>
<p>1934-35 938 43.8% 115 16.3% 711 15.8%</p>
<p>(According to "Where is the World Going?" Second half of 1934, page 12. Japanese units are in millions of yen, British in millions of pounds, and American in millions of dollars.)</p>
<p>The increase in military spending in 1934 was a common phenomenon in various countries. The large proportion of expenditures, such as Japan's nearly one-half, is truly astonishing. Although the numerical value of military spending in the United States was slightly less than the previous year, the proportion of expenditures still increased. Because of the increase in military spending and other expenses, the budgets of various countries have a so-called "deficit," so they have to raise public debt as a remedy. The amount of public debt raised by various countries in 1934 was huge and set an unprecedented record, which is also a feature of the world economy in 1934.</p>
<p>The amounts of national debt of major countries in the world for the past seven years are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Japan United Kingdom Germany Italy United States France</p>
<p>Unit Million Yen Million Pounds Million Marks Million Lire Million Dollars Million Francs</p>
<p>1928 5.397 7.631 7.131 88.287 17.604 468.678</p>
<p>1929 5.831 7.620 8.229 88.932 16.931 Unknown</p>
<p>1930 5.959 7.597 9.630 89.877 16.185 482.127 1931 5.0955 7.583 11.342 93.178 16.801 480.770</p>
<p>1932 6.187 7.647 11.434 97.268 19.487 481.188</p>
<p>1933 7.054 7.860 11.690 99.029 22.539 491.899</p>
<p>1934 8.139 8.024 11.793 10.3478 27.053 Unknown</p>
<p>(The fiscal year for Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France ends in March each year, while the fiscal year for Italy and the United States ends in June. According to "Where is the World Going, Second Half of 1934, page 2)</p>
<p>Since the finances of various countries are so strained, the phenomenon of financial turmoil is naturally expected. The scope of financial issues is quite broad, and it is not easy to describe them one by one. Now we will only cite the following two matters for a simple investigation. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>President Wang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Important Figures Gather at the Sun Residence for a Long Talk</p>
<p>The Central Government Hopes Mr. Hu Will Come to Beijing to Jointly Take Responsibility</p>
<p>President Wang Visits the Municipal Government in the Morning and Returns to Beijing in the Evening</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing at 7:10 yesterday morning to consult a doctor for an examination and to meet with Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, and others at the Sun residence for three hours to discuss the issue of unity. In the morning, he visited the new construction in the city center area and returned to Beijing by overnight train in the evening. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Medical Examination</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang, accompanied by Tie Cizeng Zhongming, took the 11:00 PM express train from Beijing the night before and arrived in Shanghai at about 7:00 yesterday morning. He got off at Zhenru and went directly to Zeng Zhongming's residence on Jiaer Road to rest. At about 8:00 AM, he telegraphed Dr. Noel to come to his residence to examine his diabetes. At 9:25 AM, Mayor Wu Tiecheng drove to the Zeng residence to pay his respects and left after talking for about 20 minutes.</p>
<h3>Consultation at the Sun Residence</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Wang immediately arranged by telephone with Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Central Committee member Wang Chonghui, to meet at the Sun residence on Columbia Road at 11:00 AM. Mr. Wang left his residence at the World Academic Society at 10:00 AM and went to the Sun residence first. Mr. Wang also arrived at 10:40 AM, and the meeting began. At 11:30 AM, Mr. Wang came out to meet reporters from various newspapers and made a statement. Then Mr. Wang went back inside and continued the consultation with Sun and Wang, and stayed at the Sun residence for lunch. At 12:30 PM, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi also rushed to the Sun residence to participate in the discussion. At 1:30 PM, Mr. Wang left first, and Sun, Wang, and Kong dispersed at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang's Remarks</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang met with a group of reporters at the Sun residence yesterday morning and said that Mr. Wang Liangchou had been running around to convey opinions and promote unity during his Hague vacation, which was very enthusiastic and commendable. As for whether the central government will send more people south, it depends on whether there is such a need in the future. There is no such intention now. The central government's attitude towards Mr. Hu has not changed in the past three years. (See written statement for details)</p>
<h3>The Jian Steamer Ran Aground in Tongzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Thick Fog, Deeply Sunk in Shallow Waters</p>
<p>The Taikoo Yangtze River steamer Jian, originally sailing in the middle of the Yangtze River, has changed its route to the Yangtze River since the water level has dropped recently. This time, it was loaded with passengers and a large number of goods from Hankou to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday and depart for Hankou today after unloading the goods. However, the ship was not seen entering the port yesterday morning. The company thought that the fog had delayed the journey, and the delay was inevitable, so they didn't pay much attention at first. Little did they know that the ship had arrived near Tongzhou at about 5:00 AM yesterday morning. At that time, it was still dark and the fog on the river was extremely heavy, making navigation very difficult. The ship was obstructed by the fog during the voyage and went off course, mistakenly heading to the sandy beach on the river bank, and the hull became trapped in the shallow water.</p>
<h3>Urgent Telegram for Help</h3>
<p>When it first ran aground, the captain still wanted to use full power to reverse the ship and drive it back into the river, hoping to escape on its own. However, the ship was fully loaded with passengers and goods, and the draft was very deep. Once it entered the sandy beach, the hull was stuck in the mud and could not move at all. At this point, the captain sent a telegram to Shanghai for help, which the company received at about 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Dispatching Ships to Lighter Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the company decided that the grounding of the ship could not be solved by towing alone. At a minimum, it was necessary to send a ship to Tongzhou to first unload the passengers and goods from the ship to Shanghai, so that the hull would float on the water and then be towed. After the decision, three large tugboats, C-1, C-3, and Hankou 10, were dispatched, along with a powerful tugboat and more than 100 workers, to work. They rushed to Tongzhou last night to carry out the unloading work. They also sent a telegram to the ship's captain in advance to comfort the passengers on board, saying that the unloading work could begin today.</p>
<h3>French Consul General in Shanghai Leaves for Home Today</h3>
<p>The Vacant Consul General Position is Succeeded by Mr. Badas</p>
<p>Mr. Badas Has Left France for China to Take Office</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Mr. Mei Liai, the French Consul General in Shanghai, has been transferred back to his country and is scheduled to leave Shanghai today at 3:00 PM with his family on the French postal ship Haili Keluosuo.</p>
<h3>The Political Council Will Not Be Abolished</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang also said that Mr. Huang Yingbai is scheduled to come to Beijing in the middle of the month to take the position of Minister of the Interior. He does not want to change the position of Chairman of the Political Consolidation Council. There is no discussion of abolishing the council. Mr. Huang's position is like that of Mr. He Jingzhi. Mr. He is the head of the military and political affairs and the head of the Military Branch Council. Now Mr. Huang is the head of internal affairs and the head of the Political Consolidation Council. He can travel between Beijing and Ping anytime to handle everything.</p>
<h3>Attitude Towards Hu</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mr. Wang also issued a written statement, saying that President Wang arrived in Shanghai this morning, and reporters asked about the various rumors about Mr. Hu Hanmin's actions. Mr. Wang replied that the central government's attitude towards Mr. Hu has not changed in the past three years, namely (1) hoping that Mr. Hu can come to Nanjing to jointly take responsibility, (2) Mr. Hu's criticism in Hong Kong can be accepted, and if there are misunderstandings, they will be explained. If he is driven by emotions and far from the facts, he will not argue, and (3) if Mr. Hu intends to go abroad, the central government will be happy to assist. However, this belongs to Mr. Hu's initiative. The above three points are the central government's attitude towards Mr. Hu for the past three years, which can be proved and has not changed in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng paid a visit to President Wang at 9:30 AM and talked briefly. Then he accompanied President Wang to the city center area to visit the various constructions of Greater Shanghai. Then he went to the municipal government to visit. During the welcome of all the staff of the municipal government, he gave detailed instructions on all parts of the municipal government. Also, Mr. Wang returned to Beijing by overnight train with Zeng Zhongming at 11:00 PM last night to preside over government affairs.</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Mei's Chinese and foreign friends and important officials of the French agencies in Shanghai will go to the port to see him off. After Mr. Mei returns to his country, the French Consul General's position in Shanghai will be succeeded by Mr. Badas, who has been appointed by the French government. Mr. Badas has taken the French postal ship Xuenuo Su to China. It is estimated that he will arrive in Shanghai on the 30th of this month to take office. Before Mr. Badas takes office, the position of Consul General will be temporarily held by the French Consul, Mr. Gao Fa. According to the new acting French Consul General, Mr. Badas, he has been in China for more than 30 years and has a good foundation in Chinese. He has served as a Chinese clerk in the French consulates in various parts of China for many years. Then he was promoted to consul and served as consul in Chongqing, Chengdu, Hankou, and other places. Then, last year, when he took office as Consul in Yunnan, he took leave to return to his country. Now he has been promoted to his current position by the government.</p>
<h3>The Date of the British Aviator's Arrival in Shanghai is Uncertain</h3>
<p>Or He Will Fly Directly to the Capital from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Sir Sam Bier, a famous British aviator, has recently made a long-distance flight to the Far East, passing through India, Singapore, and the Malay Peninsula, and arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 7th of this month. He has now been allowed to fly in China. He was originally scheduled to take off for Shanghai within a few days, and then travel to Beijing, Ping, Han, and other places, and then transfer to Korea and Japan, and then return to England. According to the news from the Aviation Counselor of the British Embassy yesterday, the flight date has not yet been decided, and he will fly directly to the capital from Hong Kong. It is also uncertain whether he will come to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The County Baojia System Starts the Third Phase of Work</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai County began to implement the Baojia system in November last year, it has been actively carried out, and the work has been very intense. It is now found that the second phase of work has been completed in all districts as scheduled. The township and town heads and Baojia households have been appointed and commissioned. In the trial townships, initially, because the joint guarantee agreement required the Baojia household heads to press their fingerprints, it was quite difficult. After the county government's earnest persuasion and the detailed explanation of the district chiefs and investigators, the township and town heads were able to lead by example and press their fingerprints first. The Baojia household heads also personally pressed their fingerprints. It is heard that in order to urge the completion of the Baojia system as scheduled, County Chief Pan convened a meeting of district chiefs and investigative committee members on New Year's Eve to decide on the third phase of work, which was unanimously started on January 4, and several steps for the progress of the work were agreed upon. The district chiefs, investigators, and district assistants were ordered to go to the townships and Baojia to provide guidance at the same time. In recent days, Wang Xuepeng, the head of the First Section, and the Baojia guidance committee members sent by the Office have also gone to the districts to convene Bao Chief meetings to lecture on the points that should be paid attention to in the third phase of work and the tasks of the Bao Chief to facilitate the progress.</p>
<h3>Sea Traffic Was Completely Blocked by Heavy Fog Yesterday</h3>
<p>Coastal Merchant Ships Suspended Operations</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was heavy fog in Shanghai, which did not dissipate all day. Many seagoing ships were blocked from entering the port at Wusongkou, and all seagoing ships leaving the port, such as the Ningbo, Chongsha, Wintai, and Chuanshan Haimen routes, were suspended. It can be said that the sea traffic in Shanghai has been blocked by heavy fog.</p>
<h3>Anchored at Songkou</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of heavy fog in Shanghai. Although the fog outside Wusongkou was not as heavy as the morning of the previous day, it still lingered on the sea surface and could not dissipate all day. The Ningbo route ship still sailed in yesterday. Although the Taikoo Daming, Kuizhou, and Lanyancun's passenger ship Ketiena were able to arrive, they were all delayed. Other seagoing ships, in order to be cautious in navigation, anchored outside Wusongkou, and there were more than ten ships. There were also many ships waiting for the fog to dissipate at Wusong before sailing out.</p>
<h3>Seagoing Ships Suspended</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, after 4:00 PM, the fog gradually became heavier, and the Pujiang River was hazy and blurred, making it impossible to distinguish objects. It was even more difficult to see anything outside Wusong. The Ningbo route ships Xin Beijing and Xin Ningshao, which sailed to the coastal areas of Zhejiang, decided to temporarily stop sailing due to the heavy fog. They immediately notified the passengers that those who wished to refund their tickets could leave the ship. In addition, the Taizhou Chuanshan Shipu Haimen route ships, as well as the Chongsha route, etc., also temporarily announced the suspension of navigation and did not sail out of the port. Even the North and South Ocean ships were all suspended from sailing out of the port. Sea traffic has been completely blocked by heavy fog.</p>
<h3>When the Wind and Waves on the Yangtze River are Huge, the Shanghai-Ping Through Train Stops Crossing the River</h3>
<p>On the evening of November 26 last year, when the 301st Shanghai-Ping through train was crossing the river by ferry, it happened to be a time of strong winds and rough waves, and the jolting was quite severe. Afterwards, the Jinpu Railway reported to the Ministry of Railways, requesting that when the wind and waves on the Yangtze River are too large and unfavorable for navigation, all 301st and 302nd crossings should be temporarily suspended from transporting vehicles across the river. Connecting passengers should be transported back and forth by the Chengping ferry. After the passengers and luggage are loaded, all the Shanghai-Ping through trains stopped at the Beijing-Shanghai and Jinpu stations will exchange the up and down train numbers and depart for Shanghai and Ping separately according to the original schedule. After the ministry approved the matter, it was ordered that the Chengping ferry must also determine the wind conditions. If, according to the wind conditions at the time, there is no danger in the Chengping ferry's navigation, the ferry can be used for transportation. Otherwise, it should not be forced to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>The Joint Reserve Association of Banks Held the Second Anniversary of the Clearing House</h3>
<p>Total Clearing Amount Last Year Was 320 Million</p>
<p>One-Third More Than in 1933</p>
<p>The Clearing House established by the Joint Reserve Association of Shanghai Banks was established on January 10, 1933. It has been handling interbank clearing business with remarkable results. The association held the second anniversary of the Clearing House the night before and held a dinner party to celebrate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dinner Party for Colleagues The association held a dinner party for all Clearing House colleagues in the grand hall of the Xinya Hotel on North Sichuan Road at 7:00 PM the night before. More than 200 clearing members from 38 banks attended the dinner, which was very grand. Zhu Boquan, the manager of the association, was absent due to illness on that day. During the dinner, Deputy Manager Xu Baoqi reported on the work of the past year and the future facilities and improvements on behalf of him. Then Zhang Xingjiu, the representative of the clearing members, delivered a speech of thanks and took a photo to commemorate the event.</p>
<p>Gifts to Add to the Fun The association prepared 10,000 gift certificates from the Joint Gift Company on that day and held a lottery after the dinner to distribute them to the clearing members of each bank to add to the fun.</p>
<p>Last Year's Business Deputy Manager Xu Baoqi reported on the work of the past year, saying that the Clearing House has only been established for two years. The work in the past year has made much progress compared to 1933, which is very gratifying. (2) In the previous year, there were a total of 34 clearing banks, with 64 branches and entrusted banks participating in the clearing. Last year, the number of clearing banks increased by 4 to 38, and the number of branches and entrusted banks increased by 13 to 77. According to the survey, the number of other banking and money industries that entrusted clearing banks to collect bills increased significantly. The scope of clearing has gradually expanded, and the function of clearing has become more and more significant. (2) In the previous year, the total clearing amount for the whole year was 200 million, with more than 900,000 bills. Last year, the total clearing amount for the whole year was 320 million, with more than 1.6 million bills. The clearing amount increased by one-third compared to 1933, and the number of clearing bills increased by two-thirds. The increase in numbers shows the progress of the Clearing House's business. (3) In 1933, the Clearing House's expenses were allocated based on the total amount of bills received and paid by each bank. The expenses were allocated at 1.1 cents per 1,000 yuan of clearing bills, which was 5 to 6 times less than the bill collection fee charged by the industry. Last year, the total clearing expenses for the whole year were calculated at only 8 cents per 1,000 yuan of clearing bills. However, this fee was not allocated by each bank because the Clearing House raised an expense fund last year. Clearing banks have saved a lot of money on industry collection fees since then. (4) The Shanghai Bill Clearing House was established in January two years ago after more than ten years of advocacy. The reason for the delay was entirely due to environmental factors. Although it has only been in operation for two years now, its impact has attracted the close attention of the financial industry in various places. It has progressed from advocacy to implementation. Two months ago, Hangzhou established a joint reserve bank and a bill clearing house. Other places, such as Tianjin and Hankou, will also follow suit soon. This good phenomenon is highly desirable to be universal. In the future, the association's clearing house will continue to plan and work together on improving procedures and habits and promoting business. It will also do its best to advocate and actively promote the establishment of bill clearing houses in the financial industry in various places to seek the welfare of the entire financial industry and make greater contributions to society.</p>
<h3>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Telegraphically Urges the Abolition of Corrupt Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministries of Finance and Industry, and the Sichuan Provincial Authorities yesterday, saying, "Recently, we received a telegram from the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce in Sichuan Province, saying, 'Since the central government issued a clear order to abolish corrupt taxes and miscellaneous levies, the people of Sichuan, who are suffering from misery, are as happy as if they had seen rain clouds after a long drought. The association telegraphed in support on July 1, hoping that the Sichuan Provincial Authorities would realize the mistakes of the past and think about the difficulties of the future, turn around and change their ways, understand the central government's determination to save the country and preserve its existence, and open a way for the people of Sichuan to escape death and enter life. However, since July of this year, we have only seen other provinces reporting the abolition of corrupt taxes and miscellaneous levies, while there has been no news in Sichuan. Now that the end of the year is approaching, the deadline for complete abolition has arrived. Not only has the order not been followed, but it has become even worse, with more and more levies. According to the complaints of merchants in various industries, the association convened a meeting of members and submitted the matter for discussion. After public decision, the Sichuan Provincial Authorities have not followed the central government's laws and regulations to abolish corrupt taxes and miscellaneous levies. Our merchants in various industries should not regard the central government's laws and regulations as a mere formality. They should only follow the order to automatically abolish them when the deadline expires at the end of December. At that time, we hope that the central government and the provincial party and government will severely punish those who violate the order to collect corrupt taxes and miscellaneous levies, and provide practical protection to those who follow the order to automatically abolish corrupt taxes and miscellaneous levies, so as to preserve their credibility and show compassion to the remaining people.' The matter has been recorded in the minutes. The association has the responsibility to implement it and does not dare to keep it from the higher authorities. We hereby telegraph to your government, the Executive Yuan, and the ministries for review and approval. We earnestly request that you grant our request and order the immediate abolition of corrupt taxes and miscellaneous levies to relieve the people's suffering. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, kowtows."</p>
<h3>Various Collection Points for Urgent Disaster Relief Donations Continuously Handing in Funds</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Urgent Disaster Relief General Donation Committee has been organizing various general donation drives, which have garnered widespread sympathy and enthusiastic donations from all sectors of the city, resulting in remarkable achievements. It is reported that yesterday, staff members of the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center donated 100 yuan in silver dollars for general disaster relief and sent someone to hand it over to the committee for inventory, demonstrating their enthusiasm for urgent disaster relief. Since the Urgent Disaster Relief General Donation Committee sent letters to various banks, newspapers, money shops, companies, and stores, the first phase of collecting general donations concluded on January 5th. They have been actively handing in the collected donations to the committee recently. It is reported that yesterday, the committee received 229 yuan in silver dollars and 14 jiao in small silver coins from the Min Bao (People's Daily) newspaper. The Zhong Hang (Central Bank) handed in 24 yuan in silver dollars collected on behalf of the Zhonghua Tea Company. The Jin Cheng Bank's Caojiadu branch handed in 50 yuan and 3 jiao in silver dollars collected on behalf of the Anderson Paint Company. The China Agriculture and Industry Bank handed in 24 yuan in silver dollars. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau handed in 47 yuan and 2 jiao in silver dollars. Mr. Li An donated 2 yuan in silver dollars. Chong Shi Primary School donated 16 yuan in silver dollars and 394 jiao in small silver coins. The Shanghai South Charity Association's Obligatory Primary School donated 5 yuan in silver dollars and 26 jiao in small silver coins, it is said.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank has been publishing detailed figures of donations from workers of various factories in newspapers. It is reported that yesterday, they received 32 yuan and 2 jiao 9 fen in silver dollars from the Qiming Dyeing and Weaving Factory, 50 yuan in silver dollars from the Luyi Leather Factory, 50 yuan in silver dollars from the Baoshan Paper Mill, and 81 yuan and 6 jiao in silver dollars from the Minsheng Yarn Factory. It is reported that the Urgent Disaster Relief General Donation Committee has issued receipts with the donated amounts and account names to each household, which will be distributed by each factory to demonstrate trustworthiness.</p>
<p>The Urgent Disaster Relief General Donation Committee received a letter from the Municipal Library yesterday, stating that they had entrusted the library to collect general donations. The library, in conjunction with the Municipal Citizen Education Center, proposed that from January 1st to the end of April, each visitor to the library and reader would be encouraged to donate one general donation coin. After the deadline, the Municipal Education Bureau and the Urgent Disaster Relief General Donation Committee would send personnel to jointly unseal and count the donations and hand them over to the committee. This proposal has been submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval. After receiving the letter, the committee considered the proposed method to be appropriate and has agreed to implement it, it is said.</p>
<h3>Each Province's Drought Relief Association Begins Urgent Relief Efforts in Hubei</h3>
<p>The Drought Relief Association of various provinces recently received a report from the Hubei Fellow Association, forwarded from the Director and Deputy Directors of Disaster Investigation and Relief, He Hengfu, Sun Songnian, and Zhou Jiguang: (1) The Disaster Investigation and Relief Director's office has borrowed No. 19, Sanjiao Street, Special Zone 2, Hankou, inside the Hubei China Foreign Relief Association, as its office address. (2) The Disaster Investigation and Relief Director's office was established and began operations on January 2nd. (3) All staff members of the office have been hired. (4) The procedure for disbursing relief funds requires the joint seal of the three Director and Deputy Directors. (5) The Disaster Investigation and Relief areas were jointly decided by the Civil Affairs Department of the Hubei Provincial Government, the Provincial Relief Committee, and representatives of various organizations at the Hubei Provincial Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Committee. Yangxin County and the Daban Special Zone were initially designated as the areas for Disaster Investigation and Relief to begin. Other severely affected areas are also under active investigation for potential relief efforts. (6) The office has sent personnel to Yangxin and Daban for inspection. According to reports, all aspects of the process are being carried out meticulously. However, the disaster situation in Hubei Province is dire, and there are many disaster-stricken counties. The limited amount of relief funds cannot solve the problem. It is hoped that those concerned about Hubei relief will contribute clothing and food, and create blessings with compassion, so as to save more lives, it is said.</p>
<h3>Ji Sheng Hui's Investigation Report on the Severe Disaster in Haiyan</h3>
<p>The China Ji Sheng Hui (Relief Society) appointed Li Jun Yunmen as the Director of Haiyan Relief, who, along with relief volunteers, went to investigate. According to reports, Changlong, after meeting with Magistrate Jin and various agencies, immediately requested and reviewed Magistrate Jin's map of Haiyan County. The next day, he rushed to the designated Zones 4, 5, and 6 (Zone 4 was originally designated as half a zone, but because the area was too small to divide, the entire zone was included) for detailed inspection. Zone 5 was found to be the most severely affected, followed by Zones 4 and 6, with little difference between the latter two. However, in the western part of Zone 4, a small number of people rely on seawall construction and salt production for their livelihood. The strong can barely survive, while the weak can hardly find food. Zone 6 has a large area and a large population, with many people making a living as peddlers. In this time of famine, not to mention small businesses, even merchants are struggling to survive. Therefore, the disaster situation in Zones 4, 5, and 6 is roughly the same. In Haiyan's rural areas, silk cocoons are the main product, followed by rice and wheat. Last year's drought was unprecedented in nearly a century. Not only was there no harvest of rice and grain, but the silkworm industry also suffered severely. Last summer, there was no rainfall, and rivers dried up. All ponds, which were normally relied upon for irrigation, were dry and exposed at the bottom. Farmers had no way to draw water, and after exhausting all means, the rice seedlings that had already sprouted became weeds, and the autumn rice turned into empty shells. Rural areas went bankrupt, and the disaster was even more severe than in Haining. Changlong witnessed the gaunt faces of the disaster victims. The homes of the people were all but empty. Some disaster victims were living on gruel, while others were filling their stomachs with wild vegetables and chaff. There were also many people leading the old and carrying the young to beg in other counties, one after another. Many people died of hunger and disease, and their corpses were left unburied for days because their families could not afford to buy coffins. Along the way, there were reports of people selling their wives and snatching rice to survive, a scene of utter desolation, too tragic to bear. As a result, bandits have risen up and robbery is rampant. The weak are left in ditches, and the strong take risks. This is indeed the reality, too painful to witness, leaving only tears to shed. Now that it is deep winter, hunger and cold are intertwined, and people are desperately waiting for help. The relief funds and clothing here are not enough to meet the huge need, making it difficult to distribute. This is a detailed report of the situation, and it is hoped that additional grace will be bestowed. The reported misery is too difficult to read. Without food or clothing, how can they survive the year? The members of the society are ashamed of their lack of ability to provide relief, and only hope that comrades in the country will rise up to save this remnant of the population by economizing on food and clothing.</p>

<h3>Completion of the Municipal Double-Decker Ferry Terminal</h3>
<p>Installed yesterday at the Bund on Beijing Road</p>
<p>Magnificent and unparalleled</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the double-decker ferry terminal newly built on the Bund of Beijing Road by the Municipal Ferry Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Xingye Trust Company has now been completed. The construction process and structural details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Construction Significance</h3>
<p>The municipal ferry operates intra-city water transportation with accurate timing, stable and fast navigation, perfect equipment, and low fares. Therefore, in recent years, it has made rapid progress. The number of passengers has been increasing daily. Last year, the total number of passengers reached more than 11.1 million (an increase of 4 million compared to 1933). Recognizing the increasing demand, the office is constantly improving and expanding all its business equipment. Currently, the terminal equipment and traffic order at various municipal ferry terminals are well-organized. However, the bronze statue wharf on the Bund of Nanjing Road is the terminus of the long-distance route, and the number of passengers entering and leaving is particularly large. According to statistics for 1934, the number of ferry passengers boarding and disembarking at this terminal has reached more than 4 million. However, this terminal is for public use, and any ships can dock there. Passengers entering and leaving cannot be separated, and there is no shelter on top. Passengers waiting for the ferry are exposed to the elements, which is extremely painful in cold winters, hot summers, or windy and rainy weather. To maintain passenger safety and comfort, as well as the order of boarding and disembarking, the office decided to build a separate dedicated terminal.</p>
<h3>Construction Process</h3>
<p>The office decided to build a dedicated terminal, but lacked a suitable shoreline. After repeated consultations with the Public Works Department, the Public Works Department, after careful consideration, recognized that the municipal ferry is a public transportation undertaking with a large number of passengers, and that the construction of a dedicated terminal was indeed necessary to meet the needs. Therefore, they immediately agreed to move the original No. 15 wharf on the Bund of Beijing Road to the south, freeing up a suitable shoreline for the office to build a steel double-decker floating terminal and two floating bridges. The office immediately began the design, which took five months to complete. In June of last year, tenders were invited, and in early July, the contract was awarded to the He Xing Shipyard. It was completed yesterday. In total, the design and construction time has been one year.</p>
<h3>Structure and Equipment</h3>
<p>The construction of this double-decker floating terminal is extremely grand. From a distance, it resembles a mirage on the river. This type of construction is the first of its kind in Shanghai, and it is rare even in the Far East. It is 48.770 meters long, 9.145 meters wide, and 7.620 meters high, with a draft of 0.610 meters. Two ferries can dock at the terminal at the same time. The terminal building is entirely made of steel and surrounded by steel windows. The floating bridge at the north end of the lower level serves as the entrance, where ticket offices are set up, with five ticket windows: (1) for cross-river ferries, (2) for first-class long-distance ferries, (3) and (4) for second-class, and (5) for joint Shangchuan tickets. Opposite the ticket offices is a consumer cooperative, exchanging money, selling cigarettes, candy, and sundries. Because the store is operated by the office itself, it is designed to provide convenience for passengers and is not for profit. Prices are the lowest on the market. There is also a car rental agency, with special agreements with Xiang Sheng cars to pick up and drop off passengers, to facilitate travel. The middle part is the passenger waiting area. Long-distance and cross-river ferries are separated by iron fences to avoid confusion. Comfortable seats are provided for passengers to wait. In the waiting area, there are reading areas and tea rooms. The south end is the exit for passengers boarding the ferry. The upper level is the business office, with simple and unadorned interior equipment. There is also a special first-class ticket office and a first-class waiting area, an information desk, and an attached floating hotel, which specializes in serving the highest-quality Western cuisine for elegant ladies to entertain guests. It is not exclusively for passengers. Fees are low, and management is strict. The interior decoration is undertaken by the Times Company, which is solemn and elegant, rich but not extravagant. The dining room is surrounded by steel windows, with heating in winter and air conditioning in summer. The scenery on all sides is excellent. The location is superior, and the air is fresh, unmatched by any hotel on land. It is expected to open at the end of February, at which time the elegant ladies of Shanghai will surely be happy to patronize it, as this type of floating hotel is truly a first in Shanghai. First-class passengers board and disembark the ferry from the upper level. Other facilities, such as hygiene and fire protection, are exquisite and complete. The total cost of construction and various decoration equipment is approximately 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Traffic</h3>
<p>To facilitate traffic to and from the terminal and intermodal transportation, the Public Works Department has converted the grassland on the embankment into a semi-circular avenue for vehicles to enter and exit, and added wide sidewalks on both sides to allow pedestrians and vehicles to pass without hindrance. It is expected to be fully completed in about a week.</p>
<h3>Hiring Porters</h3>
<p>Because many passengers carry luggage and items, the office has hired porters who wear numbered uniforms and charge fixed fees. Ordinary items cost 8 copper coins per piece, and special items that require two people to carry cost 16 copper coins per piece. If there are additional demands or unsatisfactory service, passengers can report to the terminal manager at any time or submit a written report to the management office, and strict disciplinary action will be taken.</p>
<h3>Commencement of Docking</h3>
<p>The terminal has now been installed on the Bund of Beijing Road and is currently being arranged. It is expected to begin docking ferries within the next week. All long-distance ferries between Shanghai and Wusong, as well as cross-river ferries to the Chunjiang wharf in Pudong, will be relocated to the new terminal, it is said.</p>
<h3>Miniature of the Shanghai Municipal Ferry Double-Decker Terminal</h3>
<h3>Public Works Department News</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Information Office released information on the Public Works Department's improvements to passenger and cargo handling along the Huangpu River. The Huangpu River ferry, operated by the Municipal Government, has historically operated from the floating pier at the intersection of Nanjing Road. However, that pier also serves other passenger and cargo needs. Approximately a year ago, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities consulted with the Public Works Department to obtain permission for the Pujiang Ferry to set up a dedicated pier for the convenience of passengers. In March of last year, the Public Works Department passed a resolution to allow the construction of a double-decker pier opposite the intersection of Beijing Road, dedicated to ferry passengers. At the same time, the Public Works Department also decided to dedicate the two piers at the intersections of Nanjing Road and Jiujiang Road for the use of other passengers, and adopted the suggestion of the Director of Public Works to equip a larger pier south of the Customs House, so that goods from other piers could be transferred there for loading and unloading without causing congestion. According to the statistics from a ten-day period last year, the vehicles carrying goods to and from the piers at Beijing Road, Jiujiang Road, and Hankou Road included 294 trucks, 1,052 handcarts, and 272 carts. The goods loaded and unloaded that did not belong to the concession accounted for 24%, 10%, and 9.75% respectively. The chartered steamships at the Jiujiang Road pier operated an average of 63 times per day, and the number of passengers disembarking at the Nanjing Road pier averaged 11,100 per day, with a maximum of 27,500 on the busiest day. After the ferry improvements, it is estimated that there will be an average of 20,000 ferry passengers per day.</p>
<h3>Completion of Liquidation of Chia Hua Bank</h3>
<p>The balance sheet of assets and liabilities has been sent to the head office for review.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai branch of the Hong Kong Chia Hua Bank, since the suspension of business and liquidation of the head office, also suspended business on the 5th, and appointed lawyer Song Yunhui and accountant Wang Sifang to announce the liquidation. It has been a week until yesterday. The liquidation work has been completed. It is certified that the amount owed to others is approximately 200,000 yuan, and the amount owed by others is 196,000 yuan. Therefore, it can be offset. Currently, the balance sheet of assets and liabilities has been sent to the Hong Kong head office by airmail. It is estimated that a response can be received from the head office within about one week. At least 50,000 to 60,000 yuan can be repaid to creditors in the shortest possible time. However, under the heading of amounts owed by others, there are one or two banks that are unwilling to pay because of their relationship with the head office, and it is necessary to wait for the negotiation with the head office's lawyer before a decision can be made. The branch believes that it is economically completely independent, so it has now negotiated with the banks based on reason, hoping that they can issue the funds immediately to repay the depositors. Furthermore, the resumption of business of the head office is indeed in active progress. Because the creditors have already discussed three measures for the bank to resume business, if these conditions can be approved by the shareholders' meeting, the resumption of business will not be a problem, it is said.</p>
<h3>National Reading Mutual Aid Association Holds a Membership Recruitment Meeting</h3>
<p>Organizing twenty recruitment teams</p>
<p>The National Reading Mutual Aid Association of this port has been established for more than a year, and the organizers are all leaders from all walks of life. Since the association hired Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, Yu Youren, Chu Minyi, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Liu Yazi, Chen Gongbo, Wang Luyi, Wang Qi, Chen Shuren, Chen Qun, Gu Zhenggang, Guo Chuntao, and other gentlemen as consultants, the association's work has made even greater progress. Recently, in order to expand the association's work and promote the revival of national culture, the association's board of directors decided at its 18th standing meeting to hold the first membership recruitment meeting, organizing twenty recruitment teams and appointing Jiang Hao as the captain of the Nationalism Team, Liu Jingcao as the captain of the Civil Rights Team, Tang Wenquan as the captain of the Great Harmony Team, Sun Zhuozhai as the captain of the People's Livelihood Team, Cheng Deyuan as the captain of the China Team, Fang Qian as the captain of the Republic Team, He Zijia as the captain of the Universal Love Team, Ding Qichao as the captain of the Government by the People Team, Yang Fulin as the captain of the Governance by the People Team, Wei Shudong as the captain of the Enjoyment by the People Team, Zeng Shanren as the captain of the Five Powers Team, Jiang Huaishu as the captain of the Group Team, Li Wuyun as the captain of the Four Virtues Team, Hu Shuming as the captain of the Peace Team, Cha Shiji as the captain of the Unity Team, Chen Xiupu as the captain of the Construction Team, Chen Qiuyuan as the captain of the Creation Team, Yang Mingxiao as the captain of the Revival Team, and Li as the captain of the Autonomy Team. The recruitment period is set from January 15th to February 15th. The top ten team leaders with the best recruitment results will each be given a prize, it is said.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Including Cigarette Exchange Submit a Joint Petition to the Finance Bureau Requesting Maintenance of Original Quotas</h3>
<p>Various trade associations, including the Cigarette Exchange, Native Yellow Wine, Soy Sauce Garden, Soy Sauce and Wine, Shaoxing Wine, Fen Wine, and Wine Restaurant Associations, submitted a joint petition to the Finance Bureau yesterday, stating: "The petition is for requesting consideration of the merchants' difficulties and maintaining the original quotas, and requesting approval. It is found that the members of our associations engage in the cigarette and wine business and comply with regulations to apply for licenses and pay quarterly. During each tax collection period, they go to the collection agencies to pay taxes and obtain licenses. If they are overdue, the collection agencies send personnel to collect the taxes, adding a late fee of 10% to 20%. This has been the practice in the past, and the tax merchants have found it convenient. Since this year, it has been changed to be collected by the sub-bureaus of your bureau. Regardless of whether it is within or outside the time limit, merchants must go to the office to apply for licenses. If they are overdue, they are subject to heavy fines according to Article 8, Paragraph 1. In addition, there are frequent increases in various licenses. For example, those who have already obtained a Class C formal license in the autumn are upgraded to Class B in the winter. Now that rural areas are bankrupt and various industries are in decline, the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol has reached its end. Business is sluggish, which is self-evident. We are considering requesting a reduction in the original quotas. In addition, most of the stores in the two industries are operated by husband and wife and do not hire employees. Each tax collection period has a limited time of only ten days. Once it is overdue, heavy fines follow. Merchants feel the suffering of heavy taxes and the pain of heavy fines. How can we small merchants bear it? Our associations are representatives of the industry, and our purpose is to maintain the welfare of our members, to alleviate their suffering, and to seek their benefits. We have to make a request on their behalf. We request that your bureau order the tax collection offices to maintain the original quotas and not to increase them arbitrarily when tax collection begins in the spring. Late applications should still be subject to a late fee of 10% to 20% according to the ministerial regulations, and not to apply the strict measures of Article 8, Paragraph 1. We also request that personnel be dispatched outside the limited time to urge tax collection, so as to benefit small merchants and avoid heavy fines. This method will benefit both tax collectors and merchants. We hereby jointly submit a petition requesting your bureau's approval and requesting that the instructions be followed. This will be in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Zhang Jingjiang and Others Praise Domestic Charcoal Cars</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Hosts Inventor Tang Zhongming at a Banquet Yesterday</p>
<p>Charcoal car inventor Tang Zhongming, after obtaining a five-year patent from the Ministry of Industry, came to Shanghai from Beijing at the beginning of this winter and established the Zhongming Factory at 270 Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu, to manufacture charcoal cars. The entire project has been successful. He drove to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities at Fenglinqiao the day before yesterday to present the car to Director Xu Peihuang and others for a test ride. The results were extremely satisfactory. At 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Tang drove his self-made charcoal car and invited Central Committee member Zhang Jingjiang, former Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Sanbei Company General Manager Yu Qiaqing, and Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan to take a test ride. Zhang and others highly praised this domestic charcoal car and believed that it could solve China's current serious gasoline problem. Wang Xiaolai felt that Tang's success was truly rare and hosted a banquet for Tang at the Navigation Club on Wuma Road after the test drive, inviting Fan Zhengbo and Zhang Jiping to accompany them.</p>

They specialize in planning life, fire, and other types of insurance for clients. It is said that this type of general insurance agency system is unprecedented in the country. Messrs. Lu and Dai graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States ten years ago, as top students of Professor Huebner. In the past few years, Mr. Lu has successively held important positions such as manager and general manager at New York Life Insurance Company, Shanghai AIA Life Insurance Company, and Taishan Insurance. Messrs. Lu and Dai have collaborated for many years. Before the new company was established, Mr. Dai served as the manager of the life insurance department of Taishan Insurance Company. According to Mr. Lu yesterday, the services and systems of Hua Yi Insurance Company are innovative in the country. The company issues various insurance policies from Sihai Insurance Company. Before clients decide on the type of insurance, the company engages in detailed discussions and research with them, so that each client can obtain the policy that best suits their needs. Mr. Lu also stated that today, intellectuals in the country have generally recognized the benefits of life insurance protection. Therefore, it is especially important to establish this type of business that is most popular in Western countries.</p>

<h3>Foreigners Robbed by Bandits at the Junction of Haiyan and Haining on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, Between Zhouliyan and Huangwan</h3>
<p>Two bandits robbed 83 foreign dollars.</p>
<p>Police and others dispatched armed police to pursue.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Electric Telegram: Mr. Macnaghten, Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, traveled from Shanghai to Hangzhou in his own car at 11:00 this morning. When he arrived at the junction of Haiyan and Haining, between Zhouliyan and Huangwan, he was suddenly attacked by two bandits. One bandit wore a gray long gown and a melon-shaped hat, was about 20 years old, and spoke with a Jiangbei accent. The other bandit had a festering middle finger. They robbed him of 83 foreign dollars. After the robbery, the bandits fired a gun as a warning and fled south. After the incident, the Public Security Bureau and Ma Ruifang, Chief Inspector of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway Patrol, dispatched fully armed police officers to the scene to investigate and are currently pursuing them.</p>
<h3>Habitual Extortion of Shops by Threatening with Bombs</h3>
<p>Claiming to be a member of the Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps</p>
<p>Repeated offenses lead to a seven-year sentence</p>
<p>Zhou Taibing (22 years old), a native of Zhenjiang, lived at No. 19 Yangzhou Road. At 8:45 PM on the 21st of last month, he went to Wanchangxiang Foreign Goods Store at No. 45 Huade Road with a bomb and purchased six pieces of silk fabric worth 52 foreign dollars. He claimed to be a member of the Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps, sent from Beijing. He said that the office was located at Yongji Lane, Fangbang Bridge, in the Chinese area and that the store was selling inferior goods, which needed to be taken for inspection. He then used the bomb to intimidate the shop and fled with the goods. Shop assistants Jiang Heming and Chen Jisheng bravely pursued him to Zhoushan Road, where they were intercepted by Chinese detective Liu Baoshan and two Chinese constables, No. 414 and No. 3001. They were taken to the Huishan Police Station along with the bomb and sent to the First Special District Court. His statement was evasive, and he was detained for further investigation. During the investigation, the Chinese and foreign detectives handling the case found that the defendant had used the same means to extort silk fabrics and jewelry worth more than 200 yuan from Tongfengyu at No. 530 Lixi Huade Road, Dehoufu at No. 478 Huade Road, Guangda at No. 215 Hubei Road, Yuhe on Fujian Road, and Lao Baohua Silver Shop at No. 328 Aivin Yi Road from March to December last year. He pawned the items for cash. The original stolen goods were recovered. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the Zhou offender back to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan from the Public Works Department described the previous situation in detail and stated that the bomb had been soaked in water to eliminate its explosive properties. Subsequently, the bomb was placed in a remote area 50 yards away and shot with a bullet. Experts had verified that it had the potential to explode. The internal blasting mechanism of the bomb was presented for inspection. The defendant had also used the same method on Gongguanma Road in the French Concession to intimidate a foreign goods store at No. 326, extorting silk fabrics worth 79.5 foreign dollars. The French police station had sent foreign detectives to request the transfer of the case. The defendant, under the guise of patriotism, used this type of explosive to intimidate various shops, extorting money and disrupting social order. He should be severely punished. Subsequently, the victims testified about the circumstances of the defendant's threat and the taking of goods. The French foreign detectives also submitted official documents requesting the transfer of the case. The defendant fully admitted to the charges. Judge Xiao Xieqiu sentenced Zhou Taibing to seven years in prison. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment. The bomb was confiscated and handed over to the Second Special District Court of Shanghai for transfer and trial, and then sent back for execution.</p>
<h3>Ni Yunlai, Who Offered a Bribe, Was Apprehended</h3>
<p>Sent to Caohejing Prison for Execution</p>
<p>Xielong Real Estate Company and Daxing Real Estate Company were previously involved in a property lawsuit in the First Special District District Court, which was being heard by Judge Shen Hongcheng of the Civil Division. Ni Yunlai, the manager of Xielong, while the case was still being heard, suddenly placed 1,000 yuan in cash in an envelope and sent it to Judge Shen's residence at No. 8 Xudong Lane, Tongfu Road, West Shanghai, in an attempt to bribe him and win the case. At that time, Judge Shen was working at the court. Mrs. Shen accepted the envelope, saw that it contained banknotes and a short note, and was about to question the messenger, but the person had already taken the opportunity to escape. She then asked Judge Shen to return to his residence and informed him of what had happened. Judge Shen immediately took the original item to the President of the Court, ordered the bribe envelope to be sent to the Inspection Office for investigation, and filed a public prosecution against Ni Yunlai for bribery. After several court hearings in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, Ni, after being released on bail, fled in fear of punishment, so he could not be arrested. Although Ni Yunlai was sentenced to six months imprisonment and fined 3,000 yuan, the sentence could not be executed for a long time. It was not until October last year that President Guo Yunguan ordered a nationwide arrest warrant and offered a reward of 1,000 foreign dollars, hoping that people from all walks of life would help capture him. Although Ni's original residence was in Zhenhai, Ningbo, he owned a lot of property in Shanghai. Since committing the crime, he had not fled far away. Recently, Police Chief Lu Liankui and foreign inspector Kuer learned that Ni was hiding at No. 19 Yuyuan Road. Therefore, at 10:20 AM the day before yesterday, they led Chinese detective Wang Cheng and detective Bao Lisheng to the place and arrested Ni. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Execution Court of the First Special Court. Judge Shen Shanzeng brought the prisoner to court and questioned him about his name, age, place of origin, address, and occupation. Ni immediately requested not to be sent to the Tilanqiao West Prison, but to be sent to Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing for imprisonment. Judge Shen, considering that the prisoner's request was feasible, immediately approved it. Before the transfer documents were completed, he ordered Ni Yunlai to be temporarily detained in the Civil Custody Office. Ni is now 41 years old and has been doing business in Shanghai. In recent years, his business has been very prosperous, so he has become a wealthy man. He usually lives in comfort, but now, due to a moment of misjudgment, he has been convicted and imprisoned. Even if he wants to regret it, it is already too late.</p>
<h3>Old Man and Young Woman Divorce</h3>
<p>Chen Yuanzhang and Zhu Meizhen both unwilling to live together</p>
<p>Asking the matchmaker to make a formal adjustment of ages</p>
<p>Lawyer Qian Yuan denies writing the marriage certificate and participating</p>
<p>Chen Yuanzhang started his career by running a hardware business, accumulated a lot of wealth, and became a wealthy businessman. Chen is already sixty-five years old, and coupled with his frail physique, he appears even older. However, because he is getting better in his old age, his interest remains strong. In his spare time, he relies on his old eyes to look at flowers in the mist. In the summer, he met a young widow from Nanxiang named Zhu Meizhen. Chen was greatly pleased. The woman was in the prime of her life and had recently become a widow. Chen asked to form an alliance until their hair turned white, saying that he possessed 100,000 yuan in family wealth and would not treat her poorly if she agreed. The woman's heart was not a dry well, and she was moved by his words. Knowing that Chen was already old and frail, she sought a better life and did not mind remarrying. Therefore, Chen rented a room on the second floor above the street at No. 26, a certain lane on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession and began living together. After a considerable period, they both felt that their personalities were compatible and began preparing for the wedding. Chen's neighbor, Pan Defan, a native of Ningbo, was a close friend of Chen's. Chen asked him and Zhang Fulai to act as matchmakers to handle the formalities. He also asked Ji Wenwei, a secretary of Lawyer Qian Yuan, to ask Lawyer Qian to draft the marriage certificate. They chose an auspicious day, July 12, to hold the wedding ceremony at the Dahonglou Restaurant on Wuma Road. However, Chen Yuanzhang, considering his advanced age and marrying a young woman, feared that not only would onlookers criticize him for "a pear blossom tree weighing down a crabapple," but also his family and friends would disapprove. Therefore, in the marriage certificate, he reduced his age by ten years, changing it from sixty-five to fifty-five, and increased Zhu Meizhen's age by four years, raising it to twenty-nine, to adjust and conceal the situation. Unexpectedly, after the marriage, Chen's attitude gradually changed. His generosity towards the woman in the past turned into miserliness. Although the woman was in charge of the household, the daily food expenses for her nine-member family were limited to only one thousand cash, causing the woman to often lament that "a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." When she asked Chen to increase the food expenses, Chen not only refused but also started arguing. The couple lived together for three and a half months, and quarrels were frequent. On October 25, the woman, unable to bear the situation, quietly returned to her mother's home in Nanxiang alone. After the woman left, Chen reported the incident to the police station, accusing the woman of absconding. On the other hand, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zhu Meizhen in the First Special District District Court, seeking to annul the marriage. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi held a hearing. Lawyer Qian Yuan and Pan Defan both appeared in court to testify. The other witnesses who were summoned did not appear. According to Lawyer Qian Yuan, he did not know either the plaintiff or the defendant and had never drafted a marriage certificate for them. Judge Peng Shi then handed over the two copies of the marriage certificate submitted by the plaintiff and defendant to Qian for review. Qian stated that although the name seal on the marriage certificate was his, he had never used it since it was engraved and had always kept it in a drawer. If he had been entrusted to handle the marriage certification, he would have used the official seal. Furthermore, he did not attend the wedding ceremony of Chen and others. Therefore, he had not participated in this matter at all. Subsequently, Pan Defan testified that the marriage certificate was actually copied by Ji Wenwei, the secretary of Lawyer Qian Yuan, but the original draft was handwritten by Lawyer Qian. The draft was still kept at Ji's place. Ji feared that Qian would deny his position as secretary, so he specially brought the power of attorney given by Qian to him to prove it. While speaking, he submitted the power of attorney to the court. However, Lawyer Qian ultimately acknowledged that Ji was his secretary but denied drafting the marriage certificate. The next day, the defendant, Zhu Meizhen, testified that she married Chen Yuanzhang and had a wedding banquet at Dahonglou. Chen himself increased or decreased their ages in the marriage certificate. Chen suddenly changed his treatment of her after the marriage, making it difficult to live with him. She had no choice but to return to her mother's house. She only took a set of clothes with her when she left, and the rest of her clothes were still at Chen's house. She was not absconding. Now that Chen was requesting the annulment of the marriage, she was also unwilling to live with him again. However, Chen should pay for her living expenses. Finally, the lawyers of both parties debated with each other. Zhu's lawyer then submitted a counterclaim requesting alimony and requested litigation assistance because Zhu did not have the financial resources to pay the litigation fees. Judge Peng Shi then adjourned the hearing for further review.</p>

<h3>Robberies by Gangs in the French Concession Target Staff and Detectives</h3>
<p>Continuous Cases Occurring</p>
<p>All Living in Jiangbei Shantytowns</p>
<p>Recently, with the arrival of the severe winter, gangs of robbers (commonly known as "pig skinners") are occurring every night, especially in remote areas. On both sides of the Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession, from Laoshifu Road south to Kangdi Road, are the ball fields set up by the Chinese Sports Promotion Association, so there are no buildings and few pedestrians at night. The bandits take advantage of this secluded location and lie in ambush in small alleys, waiting for pedestrians or vehicles to pass by, and then come out to rob. Recently, the French police station received reports from victims that many robberies had occurred in that section of the road, so they dispatched Chinese and foreign constables to patrol that section of the road. At about 1:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, French police detective Zhou Ruzhang and constable Gao Hongxuan arrested two Jiangbei robbers, Chen Xiaosi and Yang Xiaobao, near the Huatong Public School set up by the French Public Works Department. They were taken back to the police station. An hour before, the police station had received a report from Qian Yixin, a staff member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, who lived at No. 1, Hepingfang, Xuehuali Road, that he had been robbed of a coat and dozens of yuan in cash while passing through the area. When questioned, Chen and Yang admitted that they had robbed Qian and had hidden the stolen goods, intending to commit a second robbery. That morning, Chen and Yang were sent to the Second Special Court with a request for a postponement until the 15th pending investigation of other offenses. Unexpectedly, at 11:30 PM the night before, Zhang Ziying, a special detective of the French police station, and Cai Jinzhang, a deputy detective, finished working at the Lujiawan General Police Station and hired rickshaws to go home to bed. Cai's rickshaw was lagging behind because the rickshaw puller was walking slowly, while Zhang's rickshaw was in front. The rickshaw puller ran quickly, turning from Kangdi Road into Sapo Sai Road northward. When he was about to reach the gate of the Huatong Public School, two Jiangbei robbers rushed out of a small alley next to the school's south wall, blocked Zhang's rickshaw, ordered Zhang to get out of the rickshaw, and said to Zhang, "Be nice and help us out." Detective Zhang knew that he was being robbed, so he ordered the rickshaw puller to stop and calmly got out of the rickshaw. He said to the two robbers, "Do you want money or clothes? If you want money, take it yourself. If you want clothes, take them off yourself." The two robbers heard this and replied that it was best to have money, but if there was no money, they would take the clothes. Detective Zhang also said, "If you want money, I have a hundred yuan in cash on me tonight. I'll take it out myself. You are not allowed to move." The two robbers smiled upon hearing this, looking pleased. After Detective Zhang finished speaking, he reached into his pocket as if he was fumbling for money, then pulled out a pistol and aimed it at the chests of the two robbers, shouting, "Hands up! Don't move!" The two robbers were suddenly terrified at the sight of the gun, their bodies trembling, and they did not dare to resist. They raised their hands, standing still like wooden chickens. At this moment, Detective Cai, who was behind him, also arrived in a rickshaw and arrested the two robbers. A search revealed that one of the robbers was carrying an empty flashlight, which was used as a fake gun. When asked for their names, one said his name was Chen Youqing, 22 years old, and the other said his name was Yang Tongguo, nicknamed "Yangtongguan," 20 years old. Both were from Jiangbei and lived in a shantytown in the Shanghai Garrison Camp. They also confessed that they were brothers and relatives of Chen Xiaosi and Yang Xiaobao, who had been arrested earlier. They confessed to committing several robberies, so they were all taken into custody. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the interrogation. Police Lawyer Gu Shouxu stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement until the 15th to conduct a detailed investigation, retrieve the stolen goods, and file a lawsuit against the previously arrested robbers Chen Xiaosi and Yang Xiaobao. Detective Zhang Ziying and rickshaw puller testified about the circumstances of the two defendants blocking the road and attempting robbery. The court verified the report, questioned the defendants, and granted the postponement until the 15th to be tried together with Chen Xiaosi and others. The two defendants were returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Fire at Dachang New Oil Press</h3>
<p>Incomplete Firefighting Equipment</p>
<p>Losses Estimated at Over 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Dachang New Oil Press, located at 3 Guangfu Road, Tanjiadu West, Caojiadu, Shanghai West, owned by Zheng Yongbao, specializing in the production of cottonseed oil, was thriving. Yesterday was the factory's regular day off, so work was suspended for the day. Only a few workers were inside the factory repairing and cleaning various machine parts. Unexpectedly, at around 8 a.m., the electric switch in the factory's oil pressing room suddenly broke down when a worker turned it on, immediately igniting a fire. At the same time, the room was covered in oil stains, so the fire quickly spread throughout the building. The workers panicked and fled, rushing to report to the accounting office and grabbing their own fire extinguishers to try to put out the fire, but it was like a drop in the bucket, to no avail. They then urgently reported to the fire department, which dispatched fire trucks to the scene. However, the roads there were rough and difficult for vehicles to travel on, and there were no fire hydrants, so they had to draw water from nearby small creeks. By the time the fire trucks were able to pump water, the fire had already spread to the engine room. The water sprayed by the fire trucks seemed to fuel the flames. After much effort, little progress was made. They then focused on protecting other factory buildings. By around 10 a.m., the fire had been somewhat subdued. As a result, about ten rooms in the oil pressing room and the engine room, as well as machinery, were destroyed by the fire. The losses were estimated to be over 100,000 yuan. It is said that the factory had fire insurance worth 75,000 yuan. After the incident, the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau sent police officers to investigate and summoned the factory owner, Zheng Yongbao, for questioning.</p>
<h3>Small Ferry Collision on the Huangpu River Sinks Another</h3>
<p>Zhenchang Ferry Hit and Holed</p>
<p>Seventy Workers Rescued Fortunately</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 6 p.m., the Zhenchang small steamer, carrying more than seventy workers from the Huaxing Paper Stack wharf at Gaochang Temple in Nanshi, was heading north, intending to dock in the Hongkou area. When passing the Zhangjiabang water area at the south end of Dongjiadu in Pudong, a small steamer, the Fourth of Qiuxin Factory, was traveling south. The ship was traveling very fast. As the two ships approached each other, neither noticed the other. When they were close and tried to avoid each other, it was too late. The Zhenchang ferry was violently hit by the Qiuxin Factory's small steamer. The hull was holed, and river water rushed in, causing it to sink in an instant. At that time, the workers inside the ship, seeing the dangerous situation, shouted for help. The ship's captain also urgently sounded the siren for help. A great panic arose on the river. It was also during high tide, making the situation critical. The Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau heard about it and immediately led by Deputy Captain Li Chenghua, along with patrol officers Pan Xutong, Police Chief Yang Bingkui, and more than ten patrolmen, took a patrol boat and rushed to the rescue. They approached the Zhenchang ferry and rescued all seventy-odd workers onto their ship. Only one person was pushed into the water and was immediately rescued. As soon as the workers boarded the patrol boat, the Zhenchang sank. It was a close call, and it was fortunate that there were no fatalities. The captain of the Qiuxin Factory's small steamer, Hou Sanshan, has been detained by Water Patrol Team Leader Li for questioning. The captain of the Zhenchang ferry, Zhu Liangxi, was also taken to the team for questioning.</p>

The part of obstructing public morals was not accepted, and the part of obstructing family was found not guilty. During the appeal period, bail was not allowed, and he was transferred to the detention center to await instructions. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers.

<h3>Unauthorized Use of Opium to Treat Illness Leads to Death</h3>
<p>Ni Ding's Loss of Son Leads to Arrest</p>
<p>In society, there is a common phenomenon of ignorant and foolish people who, when suffering from symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea, often swallow opium ash, believing that opium ash alone can cure all diseases. In reality, this is a great mistake. After the poisonous substance of opium ash enters the abdomen, its nature is extremely violent. If one is not careful and swallows too much, it can lead to death. Such incidents are often heard. Now, Ni Xuegen, a 25-year-old from Wuxi, and his wife, Ni Ding, a 22-year-old, live together at 9 Chongye Lane, Feihong Road, Shanghai North. He works at the Zhang Yichang Copperware Store on Dongyouheng Road in Hongkou, leaving early and returning late, which is common for him. In March of this year, they gave birth to a son named Youhua. The child's physique was quite strong, lively, and lovely. Recently, the infant, who was only ten months old, suddenly suffered from diarrhea. Ni did not seek medical treatment. Ni's wife, Ding, obtained a small amount of opium ash from the neighbor's swallow's nest at around 2 p.m. the day before yesterday and fed it to the infant to swallow. Unexpectedly, the child's face immediately turned red, his expression changed drastically. Ni Ding, seeing this, was horrified and panicked. Only then did she realize that she had mistakenly fed a poisonous substance, and it was too late to regret it. She urgently took the child to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but the poison had been absorbed too deeply, and the treatment was ineffective. His pulse stopped, and his breathing became intermittent until yesterday morning. However, his heart was still warm. Ni Xuegen knew that there was no way to save him, so he took him home, and he soon died. The incident was learned by the Linping Road Police, who sent police officers to arrest and detain Ni Ding. At the same time, they ordered the local guarantor, Ling Renjie, to report to the local court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Xie Lian and the coroner went to perform the autopsy.</p>

<h3>Zhou Weishi's Accusation Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>Zhou Weishi, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou living in Shanghai, was accused by Dong Zhihe and other creditors of Gongfa Company in the First Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai, with lawyers Dong Yu and others hired.

<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Hearing Words, She Hides Her Tears and Sells Herself into Hardship, Carefully Secretly Seeks to Rely on Him with Ardent Affection.</p>
<p>These words caused Wang Beihai to blush. Because his possessions were not easily acquired, he shouldn't give them away so readily. Seeing his red face, Cheng Zhiqian couldn't help but think that his words had been too direct, so he smiled at Aunt Hu and said, "Even so, you can't disregard people's kindness. But it's unreasonable to just accept someone's empty kindness. Now, let me mediate. Tomorrow morning, Aunt Hu can come to my place to take three or four catties of flour. This flour will be considered a gift from Mr. Wang." Aunt Hu laughed, "Oh! Mr. Cheng's explanation makes everything clear, why do you still need to buy flour for me?" Wang Beihai said, "That's Mr. Cheng's kindness, you can't dismiss it." Yueying looked from Zhiqian's face to Beihai's face, nodded slightly, and whispered, "We thank you first." Aunt Hu was even more beaming with joy, thanking them repeatedly. That Miss Yueying didn't feel much receiving the two dollars from Cheng Zhiqian. Only Wang Beihai, in such difficult circumstances, was willing to share half of his flour, which was truly touching. Therefore, thanking them as she walked out, her eyes were still fixed on Wang Beihai. The meaning seemed to be saying, "Although I can't say anything, I'm very grateful to you in my heart." Because she was thinking this way, she first supported the back of the chair, then the corner of the table, and then the half-open door. It was as if something had suddenly gone wrong with her legs, making it difficult for her to walk. As she reached the door, Aunt Hu hurried forward and pulled her sleeve, saying, "Let's go, don't tear the borrowed clothes. Return them quickly." It was the truth, a young and self-conscious girl, in front of a young male student, this embarrassment was no less than Jia Duocai's face-to-face criticism of her appearance. She didn't say anything more and followed Aunt Hu out. (110)</p>
<h3>Wang Renqiu's Commentary on "Investiture of the Gods"</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Wang Renqiu's Xiangqilou Diary contains discussions about "Investiture of the Gods," which are recorded below.</p>
<p>" 'Investiture of the Gods' was originally intended to be like 'Water Margin' and 'Journey to the West,' and it also borrows from 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms.' Its writing is disorderly and dates back to after the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty. However, the common people widely believe in it, even to the point of altering the titles of gods. Even today, the Four Heavenly Kings, the Hum-Ha Gods, the God of Wealth, and the God of Smallpox all originate from it, and it has become an unchangeable classic among the common people. When I was a child, I liked its mention of the Taiji Diagram causing the disaster of being burned to death, which was probably meant to satirize the Ming Emperor Taizong's killing of Fang Xiaoru and other gentlemen. And its mention of pigs and dogs assisting Bai Zhu Zongrong was meant to satirize Li Jinglong and other generals, believing that each had its target. However, its text has expanded into hundreds of thousands of characters, and it must have some intention to be able to elaborate. And Wen Zhong is also meant to be like Zhang Jiangling, who was arrogant without learning. Its mention of the "Withered Ring" clearly refers to the Tingji incident. People of the Ming Dynasty liked to write about legends and romances, and this one is particularly humorous, strange, and unfair, with many accusations. In general, it takes wealth and lust as warnings, so it particularly values Zhao Gongming and his sister. Wealth is the brother and lust is the sister, and there can be no lust without wealth. Placing them among the Ten Absolutes means that they have killed countless lives, especially in middle age, when they are still involved in wealth and lust. When the Ten Absolutes are broken, the immortals are killed, and when the Ten Thousand Immortals are defeated, they are like monkeys wearing hats. This means that from commoners to emperors, they cannot be trapped in the Soul-Reaping Formation by the Taiji Diagram. Therefore, they must use the Taiji Diagram to easily disregard human life. It is not allowed for the Crown Prince to enter the Taiji Diagram, which is what those who hate the times and resent vulgarity do. The main point is that the wise and intelligent all help the rebels, and the slanderous and evil all become gods. Only birds and beasts can communicate with heaven, and it is extremely disgusted with the words of the scholars of the Song Dynasty. It is suspected to be the work of Li Zhuowu. In the past, I suspected that it contained the theory of Jindan medical prescriptions and wanted to comment on it, but now I know that it is still a pedantic scholar, so I mark its intention in this way. As for its divine names, they probably have other sources and did not originate from this, so there is nothing to examine."</p>
<p>Who is the author of "Investiture of the Gods"? Modern people have already investigated it. Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Popular Novels," Volume 5, Section B of Ming and Qing Novels, records: "'Investiture of the Gods,' one hundred chapters, written by Xu Zhonglin of the Ming Dynasty. (Note: According to the Ming edition in two volumes, titled Zhonglin, a native of Yingtian Prefecture, Nanjing, with an unknown name and the pseudonym Zhongshan Yisou. A book is stored in the Cabinet Library of Japan, a Ming edition. This is its crowning achievement."</p>
<p>Wang Renqiu's words are inevitably far-fetched. The story of King Wu's conquest of Zhou already existed in the Song Dynasty, and Xu only expanded and elaborated on it, and it may not have the intention of satirizing politics. Scholars like to interpret deeply and intricately, and they are mostly like this. Renqiu once wanted to comment on it, but fortunately he didn't, otherwise it would only be like a lecture with a high head, and he may not have the literary insight of Jin Shengtan.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Drunk Fool)</p>
<p>"Thirteen" is already an ominous term and is recognized by Westerners. So, why did the people in the Saar region, whose vote is attracting worldwide attention, choose to hold their self-determination vote on January 13th? If it causes an ominous event, or the powder keg of Europe explodes as a result, wouldn't it be blamed on "thirteen" again?</p>
<p>Thirteen, thirteen, I worry about you.</p>
<h3>Hard Struggle in Recession</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Then it seemed there was a slight sense of clearing, so I took advantage of the gap to go out on the street for a walk to buy some things. The main street was strangely lively. Men and women were jostling each other, and traffic was endless. Music was audible everywhere. In front of the shops, colorful sheds were erected, painted with pictures such as "Zhao Zilong Alone Rescuing the Young Lord" and "Liu Xuande Thrice Visiting the Thatched Cottage," attracting people to look up and point fingers as they commented. At first glance, who could say that this was not a scene of prosperity?</p>
<p>But some shops, because they couldn't afford to erect colorful sheds or hire musicians, had to build high platforms in front of their doors, with two people standing there making faces, forcing their throats to shout. "Luzon hats, buy one for two dimes, it's nice to wear on a cold day." They shouted like this in turn, forcing their throats to shout like this, and they were already hoarse, but the audience in front of the platform only raised their heads, opened their mouths, and stared blankly at the faces and the Luzon hats. Ah! What is this scene?</p>
<p>Walking further, I saw two shoe shops, both with a one-bay storefront, and they were next to each other. In front of one shop, a colorful shed was erected, which was strangely eye-catching. Probably because the shop had just finished repairs, there were couplets on both sides of the colorful shed. The couplet characters were red and green, and the words were, "Now that the construction is successful, the opening is celebrated as usual." On the sidewalk in front of the door, there was also a Qingyin stage, and even pedestrians couldn't pass through. In front of the other shop, it was deserted, with only a wooden sign hanging high. On the red paper, the five words "Grand Sale in This Shop" were written in large characters; next to it, there was a line of sloppy characters, which read: "The Qingyin colorful shed is a waste of money, it's originally cheating people for food!"</p>
<p>Seeing this, I couldn't help but be stunned. Competition among peers to grab business is common in large cities and is not surprising; but if this phenomenon also exists in the interior, then how can it only be described as "recession"? The six words "Originally cheating people for food" are a kind of wail issued after the exhaustion of plans, and at the same time, it also carries a hint of anger. Alas, they are struggling hard!</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Sightseeing Flight Encountered Fog (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>At nine o'clock sharp, the plane landed in Wenzhou. Representatives from local agencies came to welcome us and invited them to try out the new plane. Six people formed a group, and each flight lasted eight minutes, for a total of five flights. The representatives' wives and daughters were also dressed up in the crowd. During this free time, we crossed the river and took rickshaws to tour the city. At eleven o'clock, we flew directly from Wenzhou to Fuzhou again, and it was expected to arrive at half past twelve. Flying until eleven forty, we saw from afar that the white clouds on the tops of the mountains suddenly thickened. In an instant, the white clouds descended to the mountainside, and the mountainside became blurred. Several white clouds flew head-on towards the plane, becoming more and more numerous, and finally the surroundings were all white, and it was impossible to tell whether the bottom was sea or mountain, and it was even impossible to tell the direction of east, west, north, and south. My heart suddenly began to beat faster, and everyone's faces involuntarily showed panic. At the same time, the radio received news that the plane flying north from Guangzhou had also encountered fog and turned back. Mr. Dai passed the telegram to us for viewing and said calmly, "Let's go back to Wenzhou for dinner first." We looked at each other without saying a word, and the pilot immediately steered the plane to turn around and fly back. The white clouds surrounding us gradually thinned, and twenty minutes later, we completely broke out of the heavy fog and returned to clear mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>We returned to Wenzhou at half past twelve. Our group still had a glimmer of hope, which was to wait for the weather report from Fuzhou. If the heavy fog receded, we could continue flying. Waiting until one o'clock in the afternoon, the weather report from Fuzhou came, but the result was that the situation was getting worse. So, with a disappointed look, we boarded the plane silently and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Afterwards, according to the pilot Mr. Fang Si, today's fog was still light fog, because the number of white clouds was not large, and there were many gaps in the middle, so we could still see the scenery on the ground clearly. We could have risked rushing through and flying to Fuzhou, but for the sake of caution, we had to turn back. He also said that the plane is most afraid of fog, followed by storms. China's flight equipment is very incomplete. If there were coastal radio stations that reported the appropriate flight angles at any time during heavy fog, then blind flying would also be possible, and it would be very safe. (End)</p>
<h3>Walking in the Garden at Dawn</h3>
<p>— Geng Bai</p>
<p>The neighbor's rooster breaks the dream, the sound of the horn is mournful, I get up and walk around the dwelling, leaning on the green moss. The thin dusk is the place of morning air, and the cold flowers send out a faint fragrance from time to time. I am the first to worry and rejoice for the world, and the rise and fall of the masses are all incompetent. I still have some wisdom left to explore in my bag, and I will try to fly and control the wind and thunder!</p>
<h3>Winter at Zǐlóu</h3>
<p>— Lín Gēngbái</p>
<p>Winter has quietly entered my small Zǐlóu. Sitting alone at my desk, pen in hand, paper spread out, I gaze out the window, and a boundless number of misanthropic emotions ignite the remnants of my wounded heart. I want to yearn for the future, but I cannot help but shatter reality, and even more so, I cannot forget the past. The mission of transforming the new society has liberated me from the pain of love and the entanglements of life, giving me a fresh strength. What a comfort that should be?</p>
<p>But adorable young women constantly flicker in my eyes. I want to close them, but the light in the darkness won't allow me, because even with my eyes shut, there always seems to be an inseparable illusion lingering in my mind. The circles within my eyelids are always inseparable from this hazy shadow. What should I do? Am I still unable to forget the past? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Many fallen leaves in the corner of the wall gradually transition from withered green to scorched yellow. This symbolizes the cold and ruthless winter, extending its authority, making people feel the transience of life, along with the fading of everything. At the same time, within the scarlet embroidered curtains, there will be ripples of faint sunlight, making people feel beautiful and bright. Doesn't this tell people that even though winter has covered the earth, the warmth is brewing the rebirth of the coming year? The mission of transforming the new society, the flickering adorable young women, which is the epitome of spring? Conflicting and contradictory fantasies comfort me, but also confuse me even more.</p>
<p>Without pain, joy cannot be produced; without conflict, order cannot be achieved; without contradiction, unity cannot be discovered. Then perhaps this confusion is the starting point of my final comfort? This first, second, third, fourth, and so on, so many confusions, in the final act, will be like floating clouds, highlighting the azure sky.</p>
<p>I am excited. I'm calculating the schedule. Today is Friday, tomorrow is Saturday, and the day after tomorrow is Sunday. Starting next week, no matter how lazy and annoyed I am, I must change my life, prepare for the things that need to be done, and follow the path that should be taken. Every day, every moment, every second, I should strictly discipline myself, because I understand my personality well: it needs stimulation and encouragement. In that moment of realization, the shadow of the adorable young woman flickers again.</p>
<p>The intellectual class will ultimately maintain its standard of living. This is the modern capitalist society, shaping their consciousness and emotions. No one is an exception, unless there is a fundamental transformation of the world's economic system. I pity the gentlemen who do not even recognize this and simply clamor for the inherent culture, desperately rushing towards the dead end of regression. They cannot imagine that the current Chinese society, all of life, has completely changed, at least in urban society. This is clearly influenced by the international economic system. Therefore, in the context of the general reflection of life in China, during the transition from China's agricultural economy to an industrial economy, the only way to transform a new society is to create a unique new economic system. Otherwise, we would have to revert to the old life and the economic system before material civilization invaded China, to assimilate society and maintain consistency. But who can deny that this is comical? When I think of transforming the new society, I cannot help but muster the courage to move forward fearlessly.</p>
<p>Before my eyes is still winter after all. I look forward to spring. I hide in a corner of the small Zǐlóu, shouting that spring is coming soon, but how should I spend this winter? I cannot just shout aimlessly. For example, to plant a tree, one must also sow the seeds, diligently irrigate them, so that they sprout, so that in the spring, they can grow from sprouts into branches and leaves, and from branches and leaves, bloom with buds. I think this is funny. If I were a tree, the new life in my fantasy would be this last, brilliant flower. But the flower not only needs irrigation, it also needs the nourishment of rain and dew and the bathing of sunlight. My own efforts towards the future are nothing more than the function of irrigation. Young woman! You must bestow rain and dew and sunlight, so that this thriving tree has a day to bloom the flower of this new society, and then the coldness before my eyes will naturally be taken away by the warm spring. After writing this little essay, it seems that the god of hope is beckoning. I forgot the coldness, I forgot all the coldness.</p>
<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"After the emperors have rested and relaxed in this palace, their spirits are completely replenished, and their attendants simultaneously prepare all the necessary bows and horses. Then, he stands up, tidies his clothes, and quickly mounts his horse, galloping into the open field. At this time, those in charge of tigers and leopards have received their cue and open the wooden cages, letting the wild beasts rush out. At the same time, many people around shout loudly or use long spears and halberds to provoke them, ensuring they are startled or enraged. These wild beasts will first flee desperately into the forest. Once they enter the forest, those people, each wearing brightly colored hunting clothes and carrying complete weapons, will separate and drive them out of the forest. However, they do not directly engage with the wild beasts, but instead throw lit firecrackers into the forest, disturbing the beasts with loud noises, preventing them from staying in the forest. The beasts then bravely jump out of the forest, right in front of where the emperor is waiting. In this way, three arrows are continuously shot from the emperor's bow. If all three arrows hit their mark, the wild beast is destined to die, and the emperor's archery skills can earn him the reputation of being skilled! If only one or two of the three arrows hit, it is still considered good, because arrows fired from stronger bows can often kill a tiger or leopard with just one arrow. However, there are also times when one, two, or even three arrows fail to kill the beast. In that case, the emperor must disregard all danger, draw his sword, and rush forward, making sure to kill it before he can stop." (220)</p>

<h3>Three Organizations in Beijing Hold an Exhibition of the German Poet Schiller</h3>

<p>Minister of Communications Zhu Jia骅 delivered an opening speech at the Schiller exhibition, stating briefly: "It is a great honor to represent the German-Austrian-Swiss Alumni Association to hold the opening ceremony of the Schiller exhibition today. The materials for the exhibition were collected by the Sino-German Cultural Association from the German side and the Peking University Library. The materials are divided into five major parts: 1. Schiller's life, 2. Works, 3. Portraits, 4. Schiller as a playwright, 5. Works about Schiller and Chinese translations. Schiller was a fighter, not fighting for his personal life, not only fighting for the German people, but fighting for the freedom of all mankind. Schiller is now closer to us than any other German writer. In terms of art, Schiller is also very similar to the Chinese stage. His views on drama coincide with those of our country's playwrights. Today's exhibition is also intended to let us know the life and art of this great German writer. Moreover, today's exhibition also has a more universal significance for China and Germany. China and Germany have had ideological relations since the 17th century. The works produced by the exchange of ideas are too numerous to mention. China and Germany have a relationship that is 400 years deep. It is our duty to maintain this friendship. The Schiller exhibition held today is also based on this idea to promote cultural exchange between China and Germany for the benefit of the people of both countries who share the same fate."</p>

<p>Shenbao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>How to Make a Straight-Line Dial</h3>
<p>— Wang Shengshi</p>
<p>Many radios in Europe now use straight-line dials. The style is novel and beautiful, but the structure is very simple. Below is a method of imitating it. The materials are very cheap. Just a little effort is needed to make it.</p>
<p>First, prepare a small piece of cardboard, a small piece of five-hao-thick wood, and two sections of glass tubes (or bamboo pen tubes) with a diameter of about eight hao and a length of about one centimeter, and one leather shoelace. After preparing the materials, follow the method below.</p>
<p>This method can be used for all kinds of radios, but for the sake of simplicity, let's assume it's a two-board DC machine. The original capacitors are mostly installed in the middle of the panel. Now we need to modify it first. Cut off a piece of wood measuring six centimeters high and three centimeters wide and nail it to the middle of the base plate, one centimeter away from the panel. Drill a hole four centimeters high in the middle of this small piece of wood, and also drill a hole in the same position on the panel. Then, if the capacitor is fixed on the small board, its rotating shaft can extend out of the panel.</p>
<p>Draw another circle with a diameter of six centimeters on the prepared board, and carefully saw it off with a copper wire saw. Smooth the edges with a rasp. Drill a hole in the center, about six hao in diameter, slightly smaller than the diameter of the capacitor's rotating shaft. Then cut two cardboard pieces into circles with a diameter of seven centimeters, and cut a large hole in the middle. Glue them to both sides of the wooden board, so that five hao is exposed all around. (Figure 2)</p>
<p>Looking at (Figure 3), it is the general outline of the dial. Draw the dimensions on the panel according to the diagram. Hole C is where the capacitor's rotating shaft is placed. The dotted line is the small wooden board. The square block with the black line needs to be cut away. This step must be paid attention to, because it is related to the overall aesthetics. Nail two small tacks at points A and B on the back of the panel, and put two small sections of glass tube (or bamboo pen tube) on the tacks, which can rotate freely, but cannot slide out because they are blocked by the tack heads. At this time, the capacitor can be installed. First, insert the rotating shaft into the hole of the small wooden board from the back, then take the round wooden board and forcefully put it on the shaft, and then fix the capacitor on the small wooden board. Part of the shaft extends out of the panel, as shown in (Figure 4), and a small knob can be used to fix it on it. The round wooden board must be tightly fitted on the shaft, and cannot be allowed to slide.</p>
<p>Then, use a leather shoelace about four hao wide, as shown in Figure 3, tightly wrapped around the round wooden board, and then routed from A and B to the top. Pull the two ends of the belt tight, and cut a small copper piece into the shape of (Figure 5), fold it along the dotted line, put it on the joint of the belt, clamp it with pliers, and cut off the end of the belt. This belt is very firmly connected. Use another piece of 26-gauge copper wire two centimeters long, flatten one end, and solder the other end to the copper piece at the joint to make a pointer. At this time, when the capacitor is rotated, the pointer moves in the square hole.</p>
<p>Then take a business card-sized piece of white paper, cut it into the size shown in Figure 6, fold it along the dotted line, and glue it to the back of the square hole on the panel, as shown in the dotted line in Figure 3. Many straight lines can be drawn on this white paper to indicate the frequency of the radio stations.</p>
<p>First, make the fixed and moving plates of the capacitor close together so that they do not move. Use your hand to pull the belt to move the pointer to the extreme left A of the square hole. When the capacitor is gradually turned out, the pointer gradually moves to the right. Now you can listen to the radio stations and record their frequency at the position pointed to by the pointer. After listening to dozens of places, you can completely draw the position of the frequency (or wavelength) on the white paper. After all the work is completed, a piece of mica can be nailed outside the square hole to avoid dust.</p>
<p>The size of this dial can be increased or decreased at will, but the length of the square hole must be slightly longer than half the circumference of the round wooden board. Ordinary radios are installed in wooden boxes, so although the materials of this dial are cheap, the outside is very beautiful after installation. When placed on a table, who wouldn't praise it?</p>

<p>— Cao Runsheng</p>
<p>Preliminary Shortwave Transmitter</p>
<p>This machine is simple in structure and easy to manufacture. Anyone who has made one or two radios will probably not fail. The vacuum tube used here is No. 31. Although the power is extremely small, it has a range of hundreds of miles thanks to the magic of shortwave. Because we want to keep the construction simple, we have adopted grid modulation. According to the actual results, it is not bad. If comrades are tired of playing with broadcast radios, then you may wish to try broadcasting according to this circuit.</p>
<p>Parts List</p>
<p>L Use hollow brass tubing (available at kerosene lamp stores), wind six turns on a three-inch diameter cylinder. After winding, remove from the cylinder and stretch by hand so that the distance between each turn is equal to the thickness of the wire.</p>
<p>Lr Wind twelve turns as above.</p>
<p>LLr is supported by four pagoda insulators.</p>
<p>CCr .00035 MFD air insulation variable capacitor.</p>
<p>C2 .002 MFD fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>C3 .00025 MFD fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>RFC High frequency choke coil. Self-made can use 28-gauge enameled wire to wind 200 turns on a one-inch diameter rubber tube.</p>
<p>T Modulation transformer. For self-made, you can use a phonograph transformer and add 400 turns of 28-gauge enameled wire on the outside as the primary (connected to the microphone). Connect the PH two heads to the phonograph head.</p>
<p>V Reference vacuum tube.</p>
<p>R Six ohm variable resistor.</p>
<p>A Battery Two volt storage battery.</p>
<p>B Battery 135 volts.</p>
<p>Microphone Battery 4.5 volt small flat battery.</p>
<p>After the whole machine is assembled, it can be tested. First connect the A and B batteries and clamp the clip near the fourth or fifth turn of the grid. Use another 16-gauge copper wire to wind a ring with a diameter of three inches, and connect a small light bulb to the two ends. Place this small light bulb close to Lr until the small light bulb lights up. If it does not light up, you can move the clip up or down until it lights up. In this way, the vacuum tube has oscillated. Then use a wavemeter in the 80-meter band and rotate Cr to make the small light bulb light up. At this time, the wavelength is accurate. Then you can connect the antenna and ground wire and rotate C. If the oscillation is good, the small light bulb will also light up. If it cannot light up, you can use a radio to listen at a distance of one or two zhang, and rotate C to make the sound received in the radio the clearest and loudest.</p>
<h3>Improvements to Powerful Vacuum Tubes for Use as Detectors</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>The main function of powerful vacuum tubes is generally to serve as powerful low-frequency amplifiers in the final stage (Power Amplifier), such as pentode powerful vacuum tubes like 25, 33, 39, 41, 42, 43, 47, etc. Because of their strong output coefficient between the screen and plate, they are used to increase the powerful audio output in the final stage. If ordinary vacuum tubes are used for two-stage low-frequency amplification, it is better to switch to a single-stage powerful low-frequency amplification, and the output volume is more than sufficient. Therefore, this type of vacuum tube is very popular among amateur researchers. However, in recent times, imaginative amateur researchers have been using powerful vacuum tubes as detectors, and circuit diagrams for powerful detection have been published in various newspapers and wireless radio magazines. Although the results are indeed excellent, there is always a disadvantage for every advantage.</p>
<p>Although powerful vacuum tubes used as detectors can achieve results exceeding any vacuum tube, the shortcomings are audio distortion and unstable feedback. Driven by curiosity, the author used a pentode powerful vacuum tube for detection in a regenerative single-tube radio. The results of the experiment were as expected. After several studies, it was discovered that the screen grid in the powerful vacuum tube is used to absorb electrons and strengthen the plate coefficient output. The instability of the feedback when used for detection is thought to be caused by the high screen grid voltage. Therefore, the arrangement method for a tetrode screen grid detection vacuum tube was adopted, and the results were unexpectedly good. The only improvement was adding two resistors to the screen grid. The circuit diagram is shown in the figure. Readers who share the same problem may wish to try adding the same modification.</p>
<h3>Several Points to Note When Using Mercury Vapor Rectifier Tubes</h3>
<p>— Yongyan</p>
<p>There are currently two types of rectifier vacuum tubes in general use: vacuum-type and mercury vapor-type (Mercury Vapor Rectifier). The latter is more effective than the former because the voltage drop of mercury vapor rectifier tubes is very small, usually about fifteen volts, and this voltage drop does not change with the load. In other words, using a mercury vapor rectifier tube can output a larger and more stable voltage. However, certain precautions should be taken when using them. These are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) The output current should not be overloaded. Each mercury vapor rectifier tube has a specified maximum output current (Maxim D.C. Output). If the current exceeds this limit during use, it will shorten the lifespan in the small case, and can cause damage in an instant in the large case. Some people often like to short-circuit B+ and B- with a screwdriver when testing a radio to see if there is a B voltage. This method is not a big problem when applied to a vacuum-type rectifier tube, but with a mercury vapor type, it can render it useless in a single move and should be absolutely avoided.</p>
<p>(2) The filament voltage must be as specified. The filament voltage of a mercury vapor rectifier tube must strictly adhere to the specified value. A voltage that is too high is certainly detrimental, and one that is too low can also cause the filament to age. Therefore, special care should be taken when designing the transformer that supplies the filament voltage. The filament voltage should also be measured at the tube pins, not at the transformer; because the filament current of rectifier tubes is often very large, the voltage drop on the wires is naturally also large and should not be ignored. At the same time, the tube socket should also have particularly good contact.</p>
<p>(3) After a mercury vapor rectifier tube has been idle for many days, before reusing it, the filament should be lit for about twenty seconds to evaporate any mercury particles that have condensed on it before applying the plate voltage.</p>
<p>(4) If the rectified current and voltage are very high, the filament current should be turned on for about half a minute first. Otherwise, if a high voltage is applied to the plate before the filament has heated up, the filament will be unable to cope and will be damaged.</p>
<p>(5) The voltage peak should not exceed the specified value. Each mercury vapor tube has a specified "Maximum Inverse Peak Voltant" (i.e., the maximum voltage that can be tolerated between the plate and cathode when the current is not flowing during rectification). This value should not be exceeded during use. (i.e., 1.4 times the voltage of the high-voltage coil should not be greater than this specified value.) For example, the maximum negative voltage peak of an 82 mercury vapor rectifier tube is 1400 volts. If used for full-wave rectification with 250 volts per plate, then 1.4 times the high-voltage coil voltage is 700 volts. This number is less than the specified maximum negative voltage peak, so it is known that there is no danger during use.</p>
<p>Also, mercury vapor rectifier tubes should be installed in a well-ventilated place to avoid excessive temperature increases, which could cause danger or damage other components.</p>
<h3>Small Experiences</h3>
<p>— Cai Rixin</p>
<p>When you have built a radio, you must check the circuit before inserting the vacuum tubes. The most important thing to pay attention to is the B+ circuit.</p>
<h3>Single-Tube vs. Multi-Tube</h3>
<p>It is absolutely essential not to connect it directly to the filament circuit. If connected incorrectly, vacuum tubes costing a few dollars each will be destroyed in an instant. The path of the B+ in ordinary circuits is mostly as shown in Figures 1 and 2. As long as the plate voltage is not misrouted, the vacuum tube will never burn out.</p>
<p>If you are still not sure after checking, you can turn on the resistor and connect the A and B batteries. Insert one end of the earphone into the F filament pin on the tube socket, and hold the other end in your hand, gently touching the other filament pin (it must touch the spring in the hole or the wiring post on the corner). At this time, there will be a "pop-pop" sound in the earphone. This sound is the same as the sound made when the two pins of the earphone touch the two poles of the A battery, which indicates that the wiring is correct and the vacuum tube can be inserted. If the "pop" sound is very loud, four or five times louder than usual, it indicates that the B+ has entered the filament. Do not insert the tube and re-check the wiring.</p>
<h3>Figure 1: Single-Tube</h3>
<h3>Figure 2: Multi-Tube</h3>
<h3>Membrane Protection Method</h3>
<p>— Afeng</p>
<p>Ordinary radio earphones are necessary items, but due to prolonged use and the evaporation of heat inside the ear, vapor droplets form on the earphone membrane. People often like to wipe them off, which inevitably wipes off the black paint on the membrane, leading to rust over time and reducing the sound quality. This necessitates replacing the membrane with a new one, which is very troublesome. The following is a brief description of a protection method based on experimentation.</p>
<p>First, check whether the membrane is rusty. If it is in good condition, simply wipe off any dirt on the membrane with a soft cloth, then find two sheets of ordinary cigarette pack foil, cut them to the size of the earphone membrane, and place one on each earphone membrane (the foil must be flat and without small holes to be effective). In this way, even if water vapor appears, it will not damage the membrane.</p>
<p>If the membrane is already rusty, simply use the finest sandpaper to gently rub off the rust, then wash off the dirt with gasoline, and re-install the foil as before. Then, the sound will be as loud as when it was new.</p>
<p>Foreign News</p>
<h3>Progress in Television</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wang Fumin</p>
<p>Television (Television) seems unfamiliar in China, but it is almost universal in foreign countries, especially in Germany where progress is particularly rapid. The Lowe television receiver displayed at the recent German Radio Exhibition can be considered a perfect invention. This machine can not only receive moving images, but also receive sound simultaneously. The scanning line of the machine is up to 180 lines per inch, so the received image is very clear. The wavelength of the transmitting television set is 6.92m or 42900KC, which may be used in the future to 1cm. to 1m.</p>
<p>In recent months, the German Reichspost and Reichs Broadcasting Co. have jointly conducted several field television pickup experiments. They designed and built a television pickup car. Inside this car, sound movies can be filmed, and the four processes of developing, fixing, washing, and drying can be completed in one minute. This is truly an amazing feat.</p>
<p>Now the working procedure is described as follows: First, take outdoor scenes with a sound movie camera, and then complete the four steps of development, fixing, washing, and drying in one minute. Then it passes through a sound movie projector. In front of this machine, there is a Nikhow scanning disc and a photocell. When the film passes through this machine, it is immediately converted into light spots by the many small holes on the scanning disc, and then irradiated to the photocell and converted into current, and input into an eight- or nine-stage sensitive high-frequency amplifier, and then tuned to shortwave transmission and transmitted.</p>
<p>As for the receiver, it can be divided into two types in Germany: the first is for household use, and the screen is only eight inches high and ten inches wide. The second type is for public theaters, and the screen is as large as eight feet high and twelve feet wide. The imaging tube used in household television sets is a Cathode ray or Braun tube.</p>

<p>Finance: Foreign Exchange Tightens, Money Supply Continues to Ease</p>
<h3>Bullish Sentiment Less Strong in the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Rebounded by 4.50 yuan in a Stable Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market sentiment strengthened, rising after falling. The silver exchange rate moved downstream, the money supply continued to ease, and the buying sentiment was somewhat stirred. In addition, Sassoon bought in US dollars, the domestic market tightened, and the situation became stable. In the early morning, the overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US were flat, the forward silver price slightly decreased, and the exchange rate also moved downstream. The price of spot gold in London fell by six and a half pence, the market calmed down, and the outside market prepared for trading, initially calling for 61.20 yuan. Fuxingyong immediately entered the market and rose to 61.22-23 yuan. The Central Bank announced its exchange rate, with both the UK and US flat, the customs gold unit fell by seven li, and the standard price for gold tenders retreated to 995.20 yuan. Within the market, Fuxingyong and others still had buying interest and rose to 61.34 yuan. The morning opened higher, and the situation was stable after the opening. Then, because the Central Bank and other institutions sold shillings, it briefly fell slightly. However, large accounts bought aggressively at the limit price, and the price rebounded again. The expected exchange rate of HSBC was announced, with the pound flat and the US dollar shrinking by 0.0625. After that, the banks' buying interest became stronger. In addition, Sassoon aggressively bought forward US dollars, and the gold market gradually rose. Although there was a supply at high prices, the dealing range was extremely narrow. The announcement of the silver equalization tax was unchanged. At this time, the overall situation was stable and lacking in impact. However, the domestic market continued to tighten in the banks, and Sassoon still paid US dollars, leading to a rise. Then, due to the greater supply at higher prices, it gradually fell back. However, because the market was calm, the volume of transactions was limited, and the market situation was mediocre. Although there was an upward trend in the morning, the morning close was still hovering. The market remained stable in the afternoon, and the banks sold shillings, slightly falling, but the buying interest was still strong. The initial report from Indian silver was unchanged and down a small Anna, but it remained stable. After entering the market, sellers became more active, and the situation in the market became silent, resulting in a lack of support and gradually weakening. The domestic market hardened slightly with it. The second Indian silver report was slightly lower again, and then leveled off, and small investors turned from short to long and worked hard to raise prices. Although there were few transactions, it was finally pulled up. The exchange market has become mediocre, and the gold market is even less exciting, and finally stabilized. Throughout the day, the overall situation was mediocre, lacking any special storms, and the market was even more sluggish in the afternoon. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 962.50 yuan, an increase of 1.30 yuan compared to the previous close. Fuxingyong and Dafayong offered purchases, rising from 2.30 yuan to 3.50 yuan. Qingfayong, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Tongyu, and Run sold offers, falling to 1.70 yuan. Shunmao aggressively purchased at the limit, rising to 2.40 yuan. However, due to the Central Bank's sale of shillings at 0.0625, there were still sellers and it fell again to 1.70 yuan.

The British and American markets closed flat, the Central Bank announced its exchange rate with the British and American markets flat, and the customs gold unit fell by 7 li, having little impact. After opening, although the Central Bank and other institutions sold shillings, they were able to maintain it because the banks' appetite became stronger.

<h3>The Foreign Call Loan Rate Has Gradually Fallen 0.30 yuan in the Past Week</h3>
<p>Since the start of the year, both the silver and money industries have been reluctant to make large-scale loans due to the fact that the Lunar New Year is coming soon, so although the market sentiment is gradually easing, the actual social situation is tighter than usual. As a result, all businesses are struggling, more than at any other time. Although the money supply has gradually recovered this time, the poor market sentiment ultimately makes it impossible to develop. The foreign call loan rate in the market was 0.23 yuan for both the morning and afternoon markets, which was 0.05 yuan less than the previous day. The interest rate was eight or nine points. In the call loan transaction, more than 2.2 million was transferred in the morning market, more than 600,000 in new transactions, more than 300,000 in afternoon transactions, more than 500,000 in small general meeting transactions, more than 400,000 in foreign pledged loan transactions taken back, more than 800,000 in new loans made, more than 500,000 in banknote recoveries, more than 700,000 issued, and 300,000 in unmarked notes, 100,000 in customer sources, and 250,000 taken in. Bank receipts and payments: foreign banks received and paid more than 2.2 million in bill money, more than 3.9 million in various goods, foreign exchange pledge and miscellaneous payments, more than 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, more than 600,000 in special exchange payments, more than 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 400,000 entered the warehouse. Chinese banks received and paid more than 2.89 million in bill money, more than 4.34 million in various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous payments, more than 700,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 600,000 in special exchange payments, more than 1.22 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 600,000 exited the warehouse.

The public bill discount rate was 0.00023 yuan per 1,000 yuan per day.</p>
<h3>There Was Not Much Rise or Fall in Auxiliary Coins</h3>
<p>The market for auxiliary coins has been generally flat in recent days. Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver dollar remained largely unchanged, with 848 yuan in the morning market and 847.5 yuan in the early market, with a total difference of 1.5 yuan between the two markets. The value of transaction was 2,000 yuan for each of the morning and afternoon markets. The price of the Guangdong small silver dollar was 758.8 yuan in the morning market and 759.6 yuan in the afternoon market, which appeared to be 0.8 yuan higher, but in fact, it was 0.2 yuan lower compared to the afternoon price the previous day. The value of transaction was 150,000 yuan in the morning market and 45,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrunk by 2,000 paper currency, totaling 307,000 paper currency, and 36,840 strings of transactions, equivalent to a price of 12,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Securities and Bond Market Remains in a Sideways Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange and the market as a whole became increasingly stagnant after trending sideways. The overnight loan rate for foreign firms gradually eased, but investor sentiment remained unexcited. Although 20 million yuan would soon arrive in Shanghai, bullish sentiment was not enthusiastic, and arbitrage trading remained inactive. The crux of the problem was entirely due to the oversupply of shares. Large short sellers were not covering their positions and were even continuing to add to them. Retail arbitrage traders had not yet seen any swaps. Bullish longs and bearish shorts were strongly entrenched. According to some analysts, large short sellers, while not necessarily delivering all their shares, would undoubtedly have a significant number prepared for delivery. A prolonged sideways trend in the market was not beneficial for the bulls. Despite the sharp drop in the overnight loan rate for foreign firms, market prices did not rise. If the overnight loan rate were to rebound, market prices would undoubtedly fall. Although the money supply appeared loose on the surface, it was actually tight, and all industries would be contracting. Bankruptcies due to a lack of liquidity were being reported daily. The bond market, as the Lunar New Year approached, was affected by the sluggishness of all industries, making a rebound difficult. Currently, due to the easing of the overnight loan rate for foreign firms, the environment was favorable, and bullish sentiment was stable, so the market might continue to trend sideways. Yesterday's trading was generally listless. The opening and closing of both morning sessions showed declines of two or three cents. There were more sell orders for No. 78, with sell orders also for Nos. 16 and 53. However, all were lackluster. Although prices were weak, they did not fall. In the afternoon, the market resembled a flat line, and prices remained unable to rally. Prices for the front months were slightly firm, while those for the back months trended weaker, declining slightly by about one cent. At the close, only the Disbandment bonds were slightly firm, with the rest still down by about one cent. Prices might first decline slightly and then rise later. Yesterday's results showed a uniform decline of five cents to one cent and a half. The total trading volume was only 8,191,000 yuan. The results of the price changes are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>The Reason for the Sluggishness of the New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>Japanese Overseas Bond Market is Softening</p>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (10th) that the New York stock market was sluggish and flat. Although commercial news was favorable, traders were unable to determine the market's future and were mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, waiting for a clearer trend before trading. Traders were also quite dissatisfied with the price action during the week, as they had originally expected the market to rise. Some sources expected continued declines before any rebound, but no one believed the market would collapse. The most important reasons for the current stock market stagnation were: (1) the impact of the Supreme Court's oil ruling remained in the market, and (2) the uncertain outcome of the Gold Standard. Due to financial difficulties, the Japanese bond market in London had softened, which was drawing close attention from traders here. The bond market was trending upward, and the situation on the small exchanges was stable. Chicago wheat rose slightly, with a total of 780,000 shares traded for the day. The Dow Jones New York Indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Date 9th 10th  Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 105.05 104.87  Down 0.18</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 36.88 37.01  Up 0.13</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 17.75 18.03  Up 0.28</p>
<p>40 Bonds 96.66 96.77  Up 0.11</p>
<p>11 Commodities 61.72 61.70  Down 0.02</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Fluctuations Only Between Three and Four Cents</h3>
<p>The yarn market was dull and unremarkable, with price fluctuations only between three and four cents. However, large amounts from Tongji and Tongcheng were being held steady. Short sellers, seeing the financial emergency, were also not covering their positions, so the market became stagnant.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Depressed</h3>
<p>The opening of the cotton market was due to another five-pound drop in American cotton prices. The gold market was stable, but market sentiment was still sluggish, and trading was very thin. Large bulls and bears were both inactive. Retail investors were not active due to the approaching Lunar New Year, causing trading to stall. Price fluctuations for each month were one or two cents. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot yarn sales were sluggish, and sentiment remained weak. Prices for each month fell by one, two, four, or five cents. Sold: Deji 900 bales, Run Kang 450 bales, Shen Yi 300 bales, Yi Chang 200 bales, Ming De 200 bales. Bought: Da Fu 350 bales, Jin Chang 650 bales, Yuan Da 250 bales, Chang 300 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Ningbo 10, Same Trade 15, Jiangxi 2, Fujian 5</p>
<p>Changsha 95, Guangdong 195, Shantou 160, Northern Merchants 2</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Becomes More Stagnant</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still trending sideways, and the situation is very bleak. American cotton has also retreated slightly, while Indian cotton prices are mixed. Large bulls and bears are not taking any action. Factories are pessimistic because the yarn market is weak and spot sales are poor. However, Indian cotton prices are said to be relatively high.</p>
<h3>Transactions are Quiet in Both Cotton and Cotton Futures</h3>
<p>The opening of the cotton futures market showed little change. Coarse Indian cotton rose by 0.05 to 0.25 rupees, while fine cotton fell by 0.5 rupees. Gold prices rose slightly, but the market remained quiet. Prices for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan. The afternoon opening was slightly higher. Chang He covered short positions, trading in two or three rounds. The yarn market was flat, and the market situation eased slightly. As a result, nearby months rose by 0.05 yuan, while distant months were unchanged. Chang Feng sold 4,300 dan, Run Kang 1,700 dan, Shen Ji 2,100 dan, Geng Feng 600 dan, and Yong Chang 700 dan. Heng Yi bought 700 dan, Sheng Yuan 700 dan, Sui Long  dan, Yuan Da 600 dan, Yuan De  dan,   2,500 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Shashi Cotton 44.50 Public Welfare Factory purchased 1,000 pieces Spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<h3>American Cotton Initially Rises, Then Falls, But Eventually Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton market was firm but inactive. Both sides were waiting for developments in Washington, so prices fluctuated very little. At the beginning of the morning session, prices for each month rose by one to three cents due to favorable news from Liverpool and purchases by domestic and foreign traders. Later, prices softened due to profit-taking by longs and selling from the South and New Orleans. It was reported that there were 200,000 bales of cotton borrowed at a rate of one cent, which would be cleared out on March 15. However, the market was not affected because it was generally expected that the rate would change to 1.25 cents. At the close, the market was stable. Spot prices fell by 5 cents, futures prices fell by one to three cents, and the far month rose by one cent. The British cotton market was mixed. Spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by one point. Indian cotton futures traders bought and hedged, and longs took profits. Jaipur rose by 2.25 rupees, Oomra fell by 2.00 rupees, and Broach fell by 0.5 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated 9th):</p>

<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Broach cotton on the 11th was 243 rupees, down 1.25 rupees from the previous day's close. According to a Xin Feng Foreign Firm New York cotton market report, long positions for March were already being unwound. The early timing indicates that the long positions must have been large. The market is currently waiting for news developments, and there is very little outside trading.</p>
<h3>Yarn Warehouse Inventory Decreases</h3>

<h3>Grain Merchants Again Sell Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was generally stable during the morning session. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago were slightly lower by 0.04 to 0.10 yuan, while Canadian wheat fluctuated by 0.04 yuan in both directions. At the opening, there was slight covering of speculative short positions, so price fluctuations were minimal, and there was no change from the previous day. The market remained quiet until the afternoon session, when merchants again sold foreign wheat. Although trading was thin, sentiment gradually weakened. As a result, the current month was down by 0.03 yuan, February was unchanged, March was down by 0.02 yuan, and April was unchanged. The spot wheat market remained stable due to slight greed from the factories, so prices held steady. Guidetu wheat opened at 4.0325 yuan, Suzhou wheat at 4.03 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 4.00 yuan, and Dali wheat at 4.01 yuan. Fuxin reportedly purchased 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: Rumors that the Canadian government would not allow short positions for May to be rolled over to July. Rural inventories totaled 136,044,000 bushels, as expected. Corn rural inventories totaled 81,401,700 bushels, slightly higher than expected.</p>

<h3>Futures Flour Buyers and Sellers Both Seek to Close Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was generally sluggish during the morning session. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago were slightly lower by 0.04 to 0.12 yuan, while Canadian wheat fluctuated by 0.04 yuan. During the opening, both internal and external buyers and sellers were gradually closing positions due to the Lunar New Year settlement, so trading was light, and there were no significant price fluctuations. Prices for each session in the morning were similar to the previous day. In the afternoon session, the current month was weak due to a halt in spot sales, while distant months were stable due to factories not hedging and slightly higher spot foreign wheat quotations. The sentiment turned stable, and new goods for June rose slightly by 0.01 yuan. As a result, January and February were down by 0.0025 yuan, March was unchanged, April and May were up by 0.0025 yuan, and June was up by 0.01125 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Supply of Rice from Hexia Remains Strong</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various groups suddenly rebounded, with over 50 shipments arriving (totaling over 9,000 shi), making it difficult to boost the sluggish market. The weather turned cloudy again, but sales were poor, and the situation became quiet again. As a result, the prices of various thick japonica rices fell by 0.015 yuan, while late rice was fortunate to have purchases of 200-300 bags by customer groups, so the prices rose by several cents to 0.01 yuan. However, Du Yang glutinous rice, with no supply again and no market, had no prices. Yin Bian glutinous rice had limited sales channels, so it also fell by about 0.01 yuan. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 20 shipments of rice from Hexia and the surrounding areas. Spot sales were weak. High-grade japonica rice had some transactions, while middle and low grades were sluggish. Thin rice was being sold at a discount, and the remaining goods were very quiet. Market prices for high-grade japonica rice were slightly higher by a few cents, while middle and low grades were slightly lower by 0.01 yuan. Thin rice was lower by 0.02-0.03 yuan, Yang Du glutinous rice was weaker by a few cents, Bian Yin glutinous rice was lower by 0.10-0.20 yuan, and customer glutinous rice was firm.</p>
<h3>The Situation for Foreign Indian Rice is Getting Worse</h3>
<p>Prices for each grade continue to fall by 0.03-0.10 yuan.</p>
<p>Speculators are seeking to sell their futures holdings, but the market is even more listless.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market suffered from ample inventories and a continuous influx of new shipments. Speculators were repeatedly lowering prices to liquidate their holdings, causing the market to decline step by step, becoming weak and listless. Spot prices continued to fall by 0.05-0.10 yuan, with significant differences in prices between grades. This was mainly due to oversupply in the market, allowing importers to take the opportunity to push prices down. After the price decline, over 40 bags were purchased by merchants from the mainland and local streets. Futures prices were being devalued by speculators, leading to an even more devastating situation. Prices had already fallen by 0.05-0.10 yuan, but speculators were still willing to lower prices to sell their holdings. New trading by foreign firms had come to a standstill, and 800 tons of returned goods were being offered. Indian rice was also being pulled down by foreign rice. Fortunately, there were fewer inventories on the market, and production costs were high, so the decline was limited to 0.03-0.05 yuan. A total of 4,500 bags were purchased by merchants from the mainland and local streets.</p>
<h3>Factory Sales of Soybeans Suddenly Become Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was expected to continue the previous day's weakness and trend lower. However, oil mills suddenly increased their purchases, which stabilized sentiment. This was because factories saw that new shipments were not flooding in, inventories were decreasing daily, oil prices were firm, and cake sales were still active. Moreover, the Dachang New Oil Factory caught fire yesterday morning, resulting in one fewer supplier. Therefore, some factories intensified their work, leading to strong demand for soybeans. It is estimated that factories purchased over 5,600 bags of Guidetu soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.75 yuan to 3.72 yuan. Also, 25-26 trucks of Dalian Siping Street soybeans were purchased at a price of 4.00 yuan. Merchants from the inner city and local streets purchased over 2,000 bags of Hankou Zhazao soybeans, over 100 bags of Dalian Xicheng soybeans, over 200 bags of Yingzhou Chen soybeans, 200 bags of Hankou Didi soybeans, and 30 bags of Hangkou soybeans.</p>
<h3>Both Sugar Market and Sugar Prices See Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw coarse granulated white sugar remain stable with no fluctuations. The remaining white sugar from local factories and Chao Shantou sugar all saw price increases, and the trend was firm. The association's price list showed spot prices for ordinary Grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 19.00 yuan and transshipment goods at 5.40 yuan, both unchanged. Grade 8-9 Dutch red sugar was priced at 13.90 yuan, and unchanged Swire Sugar B brand remained at 19.30 yuan. Local factory refined white sugar Zhenyu Grade 1 was at 18.30 yuan, Grade 2 at 18.10 yuan, Grade 3 at 17.95 yuan, and Grade 4 at 17.85 yuan, all up by 0.10 yuan. There were reports of Jian merchants offering over 300 pieces of Quanzhou Sliced Green sugar at 10.00 yuan, Xinghua merchants offering dozens of pieces of Xinghua Sliced Green sugar at 10.00 yuan, Guangdong merchants offering over 100 pieces of Shimen Sliced Green sugar at 10.00 yuan, and Chao merchants continuing to offer over 1,000 bags of Chao Green sugar, with Huanggang Green priced at 10.60 yuan to 10.70 yuan and half-south Green at 10.04 yuan, Longgang Green was priced at 10.02 yuan to 10.00 yuan, which was up by another 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. Hainan red sugar was offered by Fang Cuihe at over 100 bags for 12.40 yuan and by Dalong at over 70 bags for 12.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods: There are Actually Reports of Shortages of Orchid Seeds</h3>
<p>Recently, due to scarce supplies, the stock on hand for orchid seeds has gradually become thin. Moreover, according to a telegram from Tianjin, inventories have also been sold out, and there are predictions of a price increase of 1.00-2.00 yuan in the future market. Therefore, sales here have suddenly become active, but good quality all-yellow goods are extremely scarce. Out of necessity, people are settling for second best, so the price of ordinary goods has risen by 0.50 yuan, and good quality goods are also on the verge of running out.</p>
<h3>Hardware: British Steel from Huisi is Running Out</h3>
<p>The market for Huisi steel is currently strong due to the use of the steel by tobacco companies for making large boxes. As a result, existing inventory that had been accumulating for many days is being almost completely purchased. Prices are therefore gradually increasing. British steel is estimated at 27.00 yuan per 200 pounds, and American steel is estimated at 29.00 yuan. However, British steel is cheaper, so there are more buyers, leading to the current inventory on the market running out. It is reported that a total of 400-500 boxes (each box containing 200 pounds) have been sold in recent days, and the demand continues to be very active. However, due to the shortage of British steel, buyers are forced to purchase American steel, so the American steel market has been quite good in recent days. Therefore, there are hopes for further price increases.</p>
<h3>Pure Antimony Prices are High, but Transactions are Rare</h3>
<p>Pure antimony from Changning Shuikoushan in Hunan is widely used in the manufacture of bullets and other military supplies and lead type due to its excellent quality. Moreover, all countries (except Russia) need it. Therefore, exports are quite considerable each year. However, due to recent difficulties in transportation and the scarcity of production, prices have soared to 850.00 yuan per ton. Transactions, however, are slow because vendors find it difficult to sell. It is reported that only a few sales have been made in recent days.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Prices May Increase</h3>
<p>Shanghai: 13,000 dan of Raw Silk in Stock, 16,000 dan of Cocoons in Stock</p>
<p>In this week's silk market, the Shanghai users and speculators have been more enthusiastic than ever because Reuters misreported a 1.00 yuan price hike in New York, causing prices to increase. Though the report was later proven to be wrong, the price has not weakened because there are limited stocks of old silk in New York, approximately 13,000 dan of raw silk and 16,000 dan of cocoons in Shanghai and Wuxi combined. The quantity is only enough for the users' need. The market in Lyon has been fairly active these days. Some traders speculate the silk price might continue to increase.</p>

<h3>Chekhov as an Impressionist</h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>Chekhov, as a mirror of the Russian commoner intellectuals of the 1880s and 1890s, lived in such a chaotic era. On the one hand, the life of the aristocratic society was rapidly collapsing, and on the other hand, the bourgeoisie was gradually rising. However, at this time, the development of capitalism was still in the form of primitive accumulation, not yet mature enough for the bourgeoisie to realize its historical mission. On the other hand, the revolution advocated by the populist and People's Will intellectuals under the oppression of the landlord-bureaucrat Tsarist government had failed. Therefore, in this period of drastic change, the general intellectuals were at a loss and confused, "unable to grasp the consciousness of life, unable to overcome the chaos of life." As a result, they had to find spiritual self-anesthesia in Tolstoyanism; they loved to chat about "small events," limited their lives to the most trivial material concerns, and filled their lives with incoherent and meaningless rambling. They lacked a firm will, were easily moved, and were neurasthenic, "sometimes weeping and sometimes laughing wildly." They felt that their lives were "painful, blind, and dirty," and they also hoped to be liberated from this unbearable darkness and vulgarity, hoping to see a phantom of happiness. However, they were unwilling to make sudden changes—this would disrupt the balance of their lives—so their only way to escape was to die quietly.</p>
<p>They felt that "the colorful clothes of life had faded, leaving only some dim and mottled traces." They beautifully fantasized about the perfection of life three hundred years later, but they never thought, "Since everyone hopes so, who will realize it?"</p>
<p>Neurasthenia, easy to be moved, lack of a systematic thought and worldview, and misunderstanding of reality—these are the characteristics of Russian intellectuals in the 1880s. In this turbulent era, they lacked a systematic and fixed thought to analyze and synthesize objective reality, and could only passively and fragmentarily capture its impressions. In this atmosphere, Chekhov, as one of them, produced his impressionistic style.</p>
<p>Lunacharsky said in "We Should Criticize Chekhov":</p>
<p>"Chekhov's temperament is very weak, just like general artists, but he is a realist. His sharp eyes are constantly staring at his surroundings, with the fanaticism of a martyr, wanting to grasp all the reality. However, the complex and intertwined real life must be constantly observed sharply and expressed accurately. Chekhov did this… The real life of the era he lived in was rushing forward at the fastest speed. Chekhov unconsciously adopted the form of essays and short stories for his works, and even his dramas have this characteristic. His method of describing complex impressions is not general and holistic, but an uninterrupted chain of individual links… The emotions of impressionists are discrete and wandering, his pulse beats very fast, with neuroticism and feminine sensitivity—all these characteristics are the most true and most unique parts of Chekhov's style, and it is precisely because of these characteristics that Chekhov has moved towards new tracks and forms in literature and art."</p>
<p>Chekhov's impressionistic style, just like the general characteristics of Russian intellectuals in the 1880s, has its social basis. Due to the lack of a systematic thought—this can be seen in the process of Chekhov's ideological changes—and the ability to comprehensively understand objective reality, Chekhov—just like Russian intellectuals in the 1880s—could not understand objective reality in its entirety, complexity, essence, and direction. He could not systematically and comprehensively create a picture of the overall social life by melting and casting the life impressions he felt through the furnace of observation. He could only fragmentarily capture it—this also determined the form of Chekhov's works—the short story.</p>
<p>However, the reality embodied in Chekhov's short stories is by no means something separated from the entirety of reality, but rather "the impression of the whole dissolved," a fragment of the whole. Chekhov's short stories, "just like a powerful magnet and a photographic negative, fragments of life are gathered and condensed through it. Many of Chekhov's short stories and essays are full of a kind of lyric poetry—although this lyric poetry is often melancholy, and floats with a subtle contempt and sneer (not a comfortable cynicism, or the gentlemanly contempt of "Look, how shabby!," but rather a helpless contempt and sneer derived from sympathy and pity)—it is precisely this that is presented as one of the characteristic forms of the style of this impressionist.</p>
<h3>Night Snow</h3>
<p>— Yang Chen</p>
<p>The trembling sound of the whistle echoed intermittently in the ink-gray sky. Groups of three or five pigeons, carrying the dying shadows of the setting sun, circled around the bare branches, and then dispersed.</p>
<p>The sky had long been gloomy, but it became hazy and dark before five o'clock. The sparsely lit hutongs were darkly immersed in a yellow hue. The eerie night spread like a tide, accumulating the silence of the night.</p>
<p>Far away, the rustling of the wind gradually grew louder. It rolled up the yellow sand, howled and swept over, stirring up a sky full of smoke, but then rushed on.</p>
<p>The snow fell drop by drop, flying diagonally, flying onto the tiles, the branches, the black hutong alleys.</p>
<p>The sharp calls of the peddlers suddenly felt miserable. So desolate, like a cry of birth pains, swallowed up by the roaring wind. The lonely figure, bending over, staggered, walked past. Letting the snowflakes accumulate on his shoulders, the edge of his hat, and then fall off. But still walking slowly and steadily.</p>
<p>A cotton-covered carriage whizzed past with a "ding-dong" sound. The driver exhaled mist, panting up and down. The bright kerosene lamp broke through the surrounding dimness, and the icy bones of the ground grinned, revealing a pale face.</p>
<p>A blue, gloomy waning moon began to shed its dim light. The snow had already covered the rooftops. They reflected each other, turning into a pure white world. All the dark places were covered in white camouflage.</p>
<p>The low houses squatted docilely under the snow. The lazy dog had already hidden outside the old gate. The white hutong alleys stretched out like long snakes, twisting forward, disappearing into the corners of the walls.</p>
<p>Silence and paleness reigned over the city. Pedestrians wished they could shrink their heads into their scarves, exhaled a long breath, and immediately a cloud of smoke rose in front of them. Icy bones would congeal in their nostrils, and their ears would lose consciousness as if they were about to fall off from the cold. At this time, they would think of the South, think of warmth to comfort themselves.</p>

<p>"Mommy, daddy... Hug, hug..."</p>
<p>This sound often pierced Wei Xuesheng's eardrums.</p>
<p>Wei Xuesheng rushed home from the company's office. As soon as he got home, he would hear the children cry, call for Mom and Dad, with no moment of peace. —Hearing the children's noise, Wei Xuesheng sank his tired body into a sea of depression. He hated the children, and even more he could not bear his wife becoming so thin and so hardworking because of these three "snotty kids." He worked in the office during the day, and in the evening, he should have enjoyed some family fun and adjusted his spirits. However, when he returned home, there was only a kind of miasma, a kind of disturbing noise.</p>
<p>"You're late coming home again today."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Wei Xuesheng stepped into the doorway, and his wife said this sentence as usual, and then said no more. His reply was also coldly indifferent. Having worked in the office all day, he was really tired at this time. He sat in a rattan chair, smoking a cigarette without any mood.</p>
<p>Silently, puffing out smoke.</p>
<p>"Children can ruin the happiness of a couple... A small family is best not to have children..." Wei Xuesheng thought.</p>
<p>He remembered that when they had no children, just after they got married, the house was clean and tidy, and only tenderness and sweetness filled the room. His wife was young, beautiful, and knew how to dress up. His wife's beauty and adornment often made Wei Xuesheng feel excited, and the fatigue of the day would often disappear when he saw his wife. They sat on the long chair every night, reading the evening newspaper, chatting, and joking, and no one would disturb them. But now, in order to manage three children and all the housework, his wife no longer had time to dress up. Her clothes were always so old-fashioned, and she didn't wear powder on her face, which was yellow and thin. Looking at her age, she seemed to be five years older than her original age. She was old, lost her graceful appearance, and completely became a poor housewife trapped in life. She no longer had time to sit on the long chair with her husband to chat, and never lightly joked with her husband. Her attitude became very serious, cold, and melancholy. Therefore, when Wei Xuesheng returned home and sat on that rattan chair, he was silent and only felt a bland taste, as if a dark cloud had covered his heart.</p>
<p>"Children can really ruin the happiness of a couple..."</p>
<p>Until the children cried, Wei Xuesheng, who was sitting in the rattan chair... Children are really demons who destroy happiness. Once there are children, the husband's love is completely transferred to the children. She only knows how to love the children and will no longer be considerate of her husband. She only pays attention to whether the children are cold or hot, and no longer pays attention to her husband's diet. A husband who has worked hard all day cannot get his wife's comfort when he returns home, and the mental deficiencies cannot be made up for by anything. Wei Xuesheng's lack of mental adjustment made him live in such a miserable and restless family, which was really painful.</p>
<p>Wei Xuesheng's spirit gradually became dull.</p>
<p>After giving birth to the third child, his wife separated from him. The husband's bed was set up in a dark corner of the room. After seven o'clock in the evening, Wei Xuesheng didn't read the newspaper or want to do any work, so he lazily went to sleep on that small bed. He got up early the next morning and slipped out of the house alone.</p>
<p>"Mom, I need to poop!"</p>
<p>"Mom! Mom!"</p>
<p>"Wah! Wah wah..."</p>
<p>Running out of the house, Wei Xuesheng heard the children call this every day. His heart froze like still water.</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Characters and Distinguishing Words (II)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Host—It's a wonder that you are still a Chinese teacher, and you still laugh at the younger generation's Chinese proficiency getting worse and worse! You even say that you have never seen so many typos!</p>
<p>Guest—According to what you say, all your students are proficient in Shuowen and good at writing ancient characters!</p>
<p>Host—I say, if "typos" are only a unique problem of modern youth, then it is the youth's fault; if it is a common problem, it has been like this since ancient times, then you can't blame modern youth. You, old brother, a dignified Chinese teacher, also write and read typos, then you can't blame modern youth even more. Let me tell you: the problem of reading and writing typos has been the same for people three thousand years ago, two thousand years ago, and one thousand years ago. They are all the same, and no one deserves to laugh at anyone! In ancient times, reading and writing typos, Shuowen set a rule called "borrowing"; since "borrowing" is a common practice in using characters, why can ancient people borrow, but later generations are not allowed to borrow? There are two ways for ancient people to borrow, one is to borrow similar shapes, and the other is to borrow similar sounds. Young people are not proficient in Shuowen, but they have unintentionally embarked on these two ways of borrowing. For example, "stubborn" is written as "屈强" (qu qiang), "strength" is written as "疆弱" (jiang ruo), "intimidate" is written as "恐赫" (kong he), "obliterate" is written as "末杀" (mo sha), "fence" is written as "藩离" (fan li), "sharp edge" is written as "锋芒" (feng mang), "tremble" is written as "战栗" (zhan li), "observe secretly" is written as "司察" (si cha)... But they unintentionally wrote the correct characters, which are in line with the original meaning of Shuowen. In my opinion, before the Chinese characters are fundamentally reformed, the two rules of "borrowing similar shapes and borrowing similar sounds" will always apply, and we should not easily laugh at modern youth. Moreover, "converging," in the Biography of Wang Mang in the Book of Han is written as "四海辐奏" (sihai fuzou), "rewarding and encouraging," in the Biography of Wang Mang is written as "将劝" (jiang quan), "similar" in the Biography of Wang Mang is written as "疑似" (yisi). The value of the Biography of Wang Mang is inherent, and no one has ever laughed at Ban Gu, saying that his historical writing is diminished by typos! Think carefully, what is the relationship between modern youth writing a few typos and their Chinese proficiency? Let me tell you honestly, language and writing are relatively specialized subjects, if you don't understand something, it's best to keep your mouth shut!</p>
<p>Guest—Then, why is the Chinese proficiency of modern youth worse than before?</p>
<p>Host—Old brother, here you go again, who said that the Chinese proficiency of modern youth is worse than before? I don't think you have even read Zhang Taiyan's Guogu Lunheng! What "before" are you talking about? Which modern writers are you referring to? If you are referring to the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties, Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, and the three Su, please first take a look at the On Style chapter of Guogu Lunheng. Zhang Taiyan, you have always admired him, saying that he is a great writer. He said, "Li Ao and Han Yu were constrained by Confucian words and could not fulfill their ambitions. Quan Deyu and Lu Wen and Sima Guang of the Song Dynasty could only discuss success or failure slightly. Ouyang Xiu and Zeng Gong liked to make grand statements, but were unable to respond to the enemy. They held the shortest argument! As for Su Shi and Wenzi, they were just petty flatterers!" If you take the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties as models for young people's articles, would Mr. Zhang Taiyan agree? Are you saying that the Chinese proficiency of young people is not as good as before, or are you saying that the "reasoning" and "organization" are not as good as before? Or are you saying that the "rhetoric" and "sentence construction" are not as good as before? Mr. Zhang Taiyan also said, "The articles of the Wei and Jin Dynasties resemble the late Zhou in argumentation. Although the style is different, they adhere to principles, attack with order, maintain harmony in reasoning, and can be teachers for a hundred generations." He also said, "All arguments should be based on famous schools, not on the School of Diplomacy." It can be seen that articles are mainly based on thorough reasoning. (Yan Zhitui's article chapter also says, "Articles should be based on reasoning as the heart, tone as the bones, events as the skin, and beauty as the crown.") Let's put aside "rhetoric" and "sentence construction" for now, and just talk about "reasoning" and "organization." Those ancient people in your mind, the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties, the Tongcheng School, the Yanghu School, etc., will definitely not be more brilliant than modern youth; as for those old antiques with beards who claim to be the orthodox of classical Chinese, they are definitely not as good as modern youth.</p>
<p>Guest—Okay, give me a few examples!</p>
<p>Host—Whether an article is coherent or not depends on whether the reasoning is correct or not; so old antiques also use words like "insightful" and "knowledgeable" when criticizing articles. You must first acknowledge this premise.</p>
<p>Guest—I acknowledge this premise.</p>
<h3>Smile (III)</h3>
<p>— Written by Lawrence, translated by Tang Xiru</p>
<p>The abbess, she had a large-featured face with several features like Matthew's own, trying desperately to suppress her laughter, but as he raised his bony, malicious chin to meet her eyes, the smile gradually spread across her face. She slowly lowered her head, lower and lower.</p>
<p>The young, pale nun suddenly covered her face with her sleeve, her body trembling. The abbess put her arm around her shoulder and murmured with that Italian sentimentality: "Poor little thing! Well then, cry! Poor little thing!" But beneath this sentimentality, the stifled laughter was still there. The strong, dark nun still stood there motionless, clutching her black rosary beads, but the silent smile could not be moved either.</p>
<p>Matthew suddenly turned his head to the side of the bed to see if his dead wife was watching him, a movement of fear.</p>
<p>Ophelia lay so beautiful, so touchingly, her pointed, deathly white little nose pointing upward, her face a stubborn child's face, gazing at that final stubbornness. The smile disappeared from Matthew's face, replaced by the most sublime face of martyrdom. He did not weep; he merely stared blankly, his expression all the more melancholy: "I knew I had this idea of martyrdom in my heart!"</p>
<p>She was so beautiful, so childlike, so clever, so stubborn, so tired—and so still—all this seemed empty to him.</p>
<p>They had been married for ten years, and he himself had never learned well—no, no, never learned well at all. Ophelia always had her own will. She had loved him, then became stubborn and left him, and then eleven or twelve times became silent, or arrogant, or angry, but two or three times still returned to him.</p>
<p>Correction: The title of yesterday's novel (一) should be (二); and the (,) at the end of the last line should be (。); and the sentence "芒。芒禹迹" in the article "Distinguishing Characters and Distinguishing Words" has an extra (。). All corrections are made here, and readers are requested to pay attention.</p>

<h3>Talking About Pigs in the Year of the Pig</h3>
<p>— Born in the Year of the Pig</p>
<p>Scolding can be considered a kind of insult. Even family members and friends can hurt feelings because of scolding. If I scold someone, the reaction will come immediately. If someone scolds me, how can I be willing to give up? But often things happen outside of the ordinary, such as this year, friends and family members are scolding me as a stinky pig, rotten pig, dead pig. Although it is said that this year is the Year of the Pig and I am born in the Year of the Pig, so the piglet is in charge and everyone is teasing, I still feel a bit insulted. However, I am not ashamed of it, and I accept it with a smile. Is it enduring humiliation? No, because I have a topic to write about because of this.</p>
<p>Since I admit that I am a pig, of course, I will start with myself as a pig. Whether I am stinky or not is not important. Perhaps I am usually too lazy to dress up, and I don't apply any Paris perfume essence, American duck egg powder, London beauty cream, or perhaps I ate chives and garlic and didn't hold a fragrant candy in my mouth, so that people's sense of smell fully feels unpleasant. It doesn't matter, because it is precisely because my pork is stinky and rotten that there is no danger of being sold, which is a great spiritual comfort. Although pigs are stupid, they are still honest. If someone calls me a tiger or a wolf, I will consider it a great shame and insult, and I will definitely negotiate and argue with them. In today's world, justice, peace, morality, and personality are almost completely destroyed by a generation of people like tigers and wolves. They are the world's greatest sinners. They are so vicious and lowly that they cannot be washed clean even under a waterfall. Although the pig is a weakling, it loves peace and will never have the ambition to invade others. Actions like going through walls and fences will not be done.</p>
<p>What is most pitiful and hateful is that people see pigs as honest and deceitful, and not only look at them with contempt, but also treat them particularly harshly, feeding them the leftovers and swill that people have eaten, and letting them live in simple, dirty, and wet places. Do people raise pigs for the sake of the pig's life? Dream on! Which pig farmer is not raising pigs for pork? Perhaps pigs do not know the brutal methods of humans. When the knife is thrown at their necks, they only understand, but they can only cry out once and shed a few tears to finish. Perhaps pigs have long known the tricks of humans, but they have always been regarded as livestock and dare not appeal to humans. Even if they cry out a few times, it will only hasten their death. I often have a fantasy, if the piglets can also clear their minds and cheer up a little, then the psychology of people despising piglets can be slightly reduced, right?</p>
<p>In the countryside, there is a kind of pig thief who is very skilled. He understands the psychology of pigs. Often in the middle of the night, he digs open the door of the pigsty and smears a pot of sweet sauce on the pig's mouth. At this time, the pig just stretches out its tongue to lick the sweet sauce on its mouth, and everything is left to the thief to arrange. Even its entire body is dragged out to the Shangdi Temple, killed, sold, and eaten. This certainly cannot be considered the honesty of the pig, but should be said that the pig is too foolish. It only knows that there is sweet sauce to eat at its mouth, but it does not know that this sweet sauce is the enemy's bait. However, this is one way of saying it. Try to observe the countless beings in the world, who doesn't want to taste some sweetness, but as a result, they lose their lives and remain ignorant. Then, I don't need to laugh at the pig's foolishness and gluttony.</p>
<h3>Horse Carriage</h3>
<p>— Zhou Han</p>
<p>Since arriving in Nanjing, I've enjoyed going out in a horse carriage. However, I prefer the open-topped carriages to the enclosed sedan-style ones. The sedan-style carriages don't allow you to see the scenery outside, like a prison van, which suffocates me. I don't like them. Open-topped carriages are so much more interesting. Along the way, I can admire the flying clouds in the sky, the azure mountains, and observe the roadside scenery and passing people. In Shanghai, you probably think riding in a car is the most comfortable, right? Actually, riding in a horse carriage is the most comfortable. Haven't you ridden in a horse carriage before? You don't believe me? Come on, take a trip to Nanjing sometime, spend two or three days, and I'll take you for a ride in a horse carriage. I guarantee you'll be very satisfied.</p>
<p>I also have a preference for horse carriages that differs from others. I don't like the galloping of swift horses and the speedy rush of new carriages. I prefer the slow, leisurely pace of old horses and old carriages. Are you laughing at me for being an idiot? You're the idiot. You need to know that I ride in a horse carriage to stroll around, not to rush. The slow pace of old horses and old carriages allows me to sit in the carriage, enjoy the scenery, and observe the roads. Moreover, when the carriage moves slowly, I can also chat idly with the coachman. Once, I hired a horse carriage to visit the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. Naturally, it was an open-topped carriage with an old horse and an old carriage. Coincidentally, the coachman was also a talkative old man. Can you imagine how enthusiastically he chatted with me? At first, he told me about his personal background and life, and later he even told me humorous stories.</p>
<p>But I've probably told you too much about horse carriages. Now, let me tell you about my visit to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.</p>
<p>You've probably visited the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum before. The scenery is as it was, nothing much to say. Let me tell you about a funny thing that happened to me. When I got out of the horse carriage and walked around the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum alone, at first I only appreciated the autumn woods and colors, and didn't pay attention to anyone paying attention to me. When I got to the mausoleum area, a man followed me and even started talking to me. You might think I wouldn't be afraid of a man bothering me, but you'd be wrong. In that quiet, desolate wilderness, I started to feel scared. But the man wasn't particularly objectionable. He was just another "polite" gentleman. Although his suit wasn't very fashionable, it looked like he wore it very carefully—not to mention that his pants had a very sharp crease. At first, he praised me for being so brave, a woman visiting the mausoleum alone. Later, he even asked me what school I attended and where I lived. Of course, I didn't tell him. He said very politely, "Madam, (he really called me Madam,) your courage is extraordinary. You must be an outstanding talent, a female hero. I admire you very much. If you don't think it's shameful to associate with someone like me, please tell me your address so I can often visit and learn from you. It would be a great honor for me." You think I rejected his request, right? No, I told him my address. But I didn't tell him the truth. I lied. He also came by horse carriage. Later, his carriage kept following us. I got anxious. As soon as we entered the city, I switched to a rickshaw and slipped away.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, this time, it was like going on an adventure. But it was so interesting.</p>
<h3>Vegetarianism</h3>
<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>His head was small and slender, a bit like the shape of a winter melon. His skin was pale yellow and dull, so dry it had no moisture. His eyebrows were high on his forehead, so far from his eyes that you'd almost suspect they were drawn on with ink. His eyes were close to his flat nose, and when he looked at people, his eyelids squeezed into a line. His entire face was very peculiar. Kong Fu was an old man who ate vegetarian food all his life.</p>
<p>It happened eight years ago, before I left my hometown. Kong Fu had also left a deep impression on my childhood.</p>
<p>One spring day, when all the flowers were in bloom, a group of naughty kids, including me, were playing around. We pulled at the flowers, caught flying insects. I was holding a featherless baby sparrow in my hand, playing with it, very happily.</p>
<p>"Amitabha! Why are you killing the sparrow?" A bony hand pressed on my shoulder. I quickly turned my head and saw Kong Fu's eyes squeezed into a line, staring intently at the sparrow in my hand. "Let it go. Accumulate good karma. Releasing life can cultivate merit for the next life." Without waiting for my reply, he snatched the sparrow from my hand, climbed up the tree trunk, and returned it to its nest. He was quite good at climbing trees.</p>
<p>Accumulating good karma was something young children didn't think about, and didn't even understand. What made me the saddest was that he took away my toy, and didn't let me kill it with a small tile. I howled and cried.</p>
<p>"Don't cry. I'll give you five copper coins." Tears stopped instantly. Five yellow copper coins had considerable power over a young child.</p>
<p>After that, whenever I caught any animal, I would deliberately let Kong Fu see it, so I could get a few copper coins to buy candy.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Bing, you're often sick and in pain. You should eat vegetarian food. Eating vegetarian food can eliminate illness and misfortune, and bring blessings to future generations." One afternoon, Kong Fu came to my house, chatting with my mother. He was a tenant farmer of our family.</p>
<p>"Old Fu, you really don't eat any fish or meat all year round?" My mother showed a skeptical expression.</p>
<p>"Of course. I made a vow before the gods." Kong Fu showed a proud look. "Don't even mention fish or meat, even if my lips touch a little bit of egg yolk, I'll throw up for a long time. I can't stand any meat. If I touch even a little bit, I'll throw up."</p>
<p>"Your sons don't eat vegetarian food, do they?"</p>
<p>"There's no way to make them listen," he said, looking a bit angry, lifting his piggy eyes to look at my mother. "I don't eat at the same table as them. Even the pots they cook meat in, I have to wash two or three times before I use them. I can't stand the smell of meat. If I touch a little bit, I'll throw up."</p>
<p>My mother asked Kong Fu to eat at our house.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Bing, what spices did you put in your tofu?" Kong Fu pointed at the bowl on the table. "Is it fried with sesame oil? It's really delicious!"</p>
<p>My fourth older brother made a face in the corner of the room, chuckling. I knew he was up to something again.</p>
<p>"Fourth brother, what are you laughing at?" I quietly walked over.</p>
<p>"Laughing at Kong Fu eating lard tofu!" He said in a very soft voice.</p>
<p>It's been many years since I returned to my hometown. Is Kong Fu still alive? Is he still persuading people to eat vegetarian food everywhere? His own stomach has already been filled with lard once. Does he know that?</p>
<h3>Lao Chen's Disappointment</h3>
<p>— Nan Yan</p>
<p>Following my appointment with Lao Chen, I hurriedly boarded the tram to C Park.</p>
<p>Walking into the park, I glanced around. It was deserted, without a single visitor.</p>
<p>"That makes sense, I'm late." I muttered to myself. So I listlessly strolled along the pond, passed through the artificial hill, and walked onto the soccer field. Almost half an hour had passed.</p>
<p>I kept looking towards the park entrance. There were some visitors coming in, but there was no sign of Lao Chen. I was so anxious that I almost wanted to run back.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a couple drifted in through the entrance. I immediately recognized the man as Lao Chen. I waved my hand in the air, and Lao Chen smiled and walked towards me, naturally with the woman.</p>
<p>After his introduction, I learned that the young lady was Miss Huang. I secretly glanced at Lao Chen's new friend. Her delicate, pretty face and those dark, shiny eyes were captivating. No wonder Lao Chen was chasing after her so desperately.</p>
<p>We walked a large circle in the park, crossing bridges, climbing hills, playing in the water, and rowing small boats. It was around eleven o'clock when we finally left the park and stepped into a quiet little restaurant. Although it was said to be a simple meal, the dishes on the table were tightly packed.</p>
<p>At the table, Lao Chen used all the skills he had to impress Miss Huang. Miss Huang's attitude towards him seemed very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>"Lao Chen's technique is really good! He can definitely hook her," I praised him silently.</p>
<p>In front of the small restaurant, I bid them farewell. As I left, I cordially invited them both to my apartment for lunch next week.</p>
<p>The day of the invitation arrived. I got up early in the morning and went to the restaurant to ask Lao Guan to send some more dishes.</p>
<p>After returning, I cleaned the apartment, sat down, and flipped through the newspaper, waiting for the guests to arrive.</p>
<p>Time really flies. The short hand of the clock on the table had already reached the middle of eleven and twelve, but the guests hadn't arrived. I was worried that they were too absorbed in their romance and hadn't heard me clearly, or that they had forgotten the date.</p>
<p>Therefore, I went over to my neighbor and called him. The person who answered the phone said he was not at home.</p>
<p>It was already twelve o'clock when I returned from my neighbor's house.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. I rushed forward and opened the door.</p>
<p>Lao Chen stood at the door, his face full of disappointment. The guest I was expecting was only him.</p>
<p>"Why didn't Miss Huang come with you?" I asked.</p>
<p>He walked into the room, immediately flopped down on the bed, and after a long while, said:</p>
<p>"Women are really unpredictable, damn it!"</p>
<p>Then he let out a long sigh.</p>
<h3>After Eight Rounds</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>Limited and Unlimited Companies</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>A long time ago, I often saw shop names like "XYZ Limited Company" or "XYZ Unlimited Company" everywhere, and I had a question: what is the meaning of "Limited Company" and "Unlimited Company", and what are the differences between the two? I really want to ask you to answer it for me, but I'm afraid that this question is not within the scope of your column's answers, so I dare not write a letter. Recently, I asked many people this question, but they couldn't give me a clear answer. I had no choice but to write to you, and I don't know if you can explain my question. Yours respectfully,</p>
<p>Wang Lvbingshang</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding general common questions, as long as we know the answers, or we can find the answers elsewhere, we are willing to give our readers a clearer explanation. This is what we have said before, and it is also the purpose of this column.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between a Limited Company and an Unlimited Company. In short: a Limited Company is a joint-stock company; the liability of the shareholders who invested is limited to the capital they invested. For example, if there is a Limited Company with ten shareholders, each contributing 10,000 yuan in shares. If this company suffers a huge loss, even if the loss is more than 100,000, the liability of these shareholders is only 10,000 yuan. They are not responsible for any additional losses.</p>
<p>The shareholders of an Unlimited Company are different. These shareholders have unlimited liability. When the company suffers a significant loss, they not only lose their original capital, but also bear the responsibility of repaying all debts. A company organized in this way is called an Unlimited Company.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Baochai Catches a Butterfly"</p>
<p>Light clouds and drizzle brew a spring shade. Casting aside idle worries, ascend Cui Ting. The blooming flowers and chirping birds cease. Suddenly, a pair of butterflies chase fragrant dust. Fluttering, they resemble a brocade of flowers. Rising and falling, they are like birds entering the forest. It must be an accident that they resemble swallows. When playing in the water, they want to imitate dragonflies. Baochai carries a silk fan and gently taps. One sees her jade sleeves slightly wet and her fragrant sweat dripping. Passing through the winding gallery, pushing aside flowers and willows with care. Just as she was about to catch them, she lamented that she could not. Suddenly, she heard whispered words through the water. Baochai was alert and able to transform. She walked past the Qingfang Bridge but hesitated. She loudly called Pin'er on purpose. She shifted the blame to Jiangdong, killing Bo. Xiaohong was very jealous when she heard this. From then on, she planted the seeds of disaster in Xiaoxiang. What a waste of effort.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "The Five Senses Fight"</p>
<p>Mouth, nose, eyebrows, ears, eyes. Having five senses upright makes a person. The mouth says that I can speak all the languages of the world. Speaking of heaven and earth, nothing is not precise. Laughing nose. Falsely claiming honor. Actually sitting high in the middle. Nose brother listen. Hmph one sound. I advise you to keep your mouth as tight as a bottle. I am able to smell and am very intelligent. Embracing the nose and chanting poetry has a phoenix-like elegance. To matters, the eyes have me on top. The white eyes often look at the people of the world. The inborn tendency to be snobbish is the most ruthless. The eyes listen and the pupils open. Saying I can distinguish five colors and distinguish gold and silver. Xiang Yu had double pupils and prospered the country. Guan Gong's phoenix eyes have prestige. Only the eyebrows claim to be discarded. Asking what virtue and ability he has. Surprisingly sitting on the highest level. The eyebrows wrinkle and will answer. Saying that there are no eyebrows on the face of the Atiao people. Moreover, drawing eyebrows is a pleasure for the Jingzhao boudoir. Xi Shi frowned and bathed in the Emperor's grace. Not as ugly as the ears. Strange shapes like chaos. How can you sell close to your face? The old ears listen and scratch their ears. Saying that I am good at listening to music and telling stories in every way. Pretending to be foolish and deaf is my forte. Able to listen to the walls and be good at preventing people. The five senses were arguing. Fortunately, the tip of the tongue came out to persuade the villagers. Saying that our gates are connected to each other and we are born as one. Why bother making a mess today? If people know about it, how can they maintain their faces?</p>

<p>Continuing the Farewell Poem from Dreaming of Mount Tianmu — Li Bai</p>
<p>The clouds are green, about to rain, the water ripples, producing mist.</p>
<p>Lightning flashes, thunder rumbles, hills and mountains collapse, the stone door of the cave suddenly opens.</p>
<p>The vastness of the green sky is bottomless, the sun and moon shine on golden and silver platforms.</p>
<p>Rainbows are clothes and wind is the horse, the lords of the clouds come down in droves.</p>
<p>Tigers beat the zither, phoenixes circle the chariot, the immortals are arranged like hemp.</p>

<h3>The Essence and Production of Newsreels (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>A Historical Record</p>
<p>Value Determined by the Significance of Events</p>
<p>When we go to the cinema, besides the main feature, there are also cartoons and newsreels. This article will discuss the essence and production of newsreels. In short, the value of a newsreel is determined by the magnitude of the event it captures. An ordinary newsreel cannot be screened again after a considerable period. However, if the event is significant or has major political implications, it may be shown again even after several years, decades, or even centuries. This is because newsreels, in essence, represent a page of historical record, and their value is further enhanced by the fact that history books only use text to record events, while newsreels can project the real events on the screen, perhaps making them even more valuable than historical records.</p>
<p>As for the production of newsreels, speed and distinctiveness are paramount. After an event occurs in Europe or America, it can be seen on screen in Shanghai in less than one or two months. The brevity of this time and the speed of production cannot but amaze us. Moreover, the danger faced by the crew and their courageous spirit during filming sometimes leave us speechless! Some newsreels may be quite ordinary, but if a military parade is scheduled, and the king is to personally inspect it, but on that day, a change occurs and the king does not attend the parade, and it is inspected by other officials, wouldn't the value of the newsreel be diminished by the king's absence? Conversely, if the king were to be injured in a car accident en route to the parade, or assassinated, resulting in a tragedy, the newsreel crew would have an unexpected gain. The event is magnified, and the value of the newsreel itself is increased. However, at the beginning of filming, the film company would never have dreamed that such a tragedy could occur and such a valuable newsreel could be captured.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Shanghai screened the Fox Film Corporation's "Marseilles Tragedy" newsreel. To help readers understand the production process of newsreels, it is worth describing the beginning and end of the "Marseilles Tragedy" filming. The Marseilles Tragedy occurred on October 9th, and by the end of November, the newsreel of the Marseilles Tragedy was being screened in Shanghai. The interval was only forty or fifty days, and it was also hindered in the middle; otherwise, it could have been earlier. This visit to France by King Alexander of Yugoslavia was indeed an important page in political history. Therefore, on the day of his arrival in France, cameramen from various film companies gathered in Marseilles, preparing to film various news events. The estimated value of this newsreel was initially ordinary. However, the assassination of Alexander and the death of Barthou in the same car suddenly increased the value of the newsreel, which was an unexpected gain. Before Fox Film Corporation produced the "Marseilles Tragedy" newsreel, they dispatched four cameramen: the Mackie brothers, George, and Lemoine. They were all members of Fox's French filming team. The work was divided as follows: Lemoine filmed the scene of the King of Yugoslavia landing at the dock, George recorded the sound of the empty car carrying the King driving through the streets of Marseilles, and the Mackie brothers filmed fragmented shots.</p>
<p>After the car carrying King Alexander and French Foreign Minister Barthou drove off, George stopped recording sound and switched to a handheld camera, following the King's car closely. Lemoine switched to recording sound, followed the honor guard, and also kept an eye on the street for news that could be filmed. When Alexander's car reached the stock exchange area, a tall man suddenly jumped onto the running board from the crowd, shouting "Your Majesty!" The guards hesitated, wondering if this man was an assassin or a drunken royalist? But in less than a second, an unexpected tragedy had occurred. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Repainting the Eyebrows"</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Let's Try Again——Grand Shanghai</p>
<p>It is a painful thing in the human world when husband and wife have emotional rifts but have to maintain a superficial harmony, living together but dreaming different dreams. If the author understands and grasps it properly when making it into a work of art, it can become a valuable and successful work.</p>
<p>"Repainting the Eyebrows" is a film about a couple without love. The main reason it did not succeed is not that it "portrays love disputes or boredom," but that the author did not understand the essence of such problems.</p>
<p>Dr. Jia Ke and his wife, Alice, lost their love after ten years of marriage. The man fell in love with a dancer due to professional opportunities. The woman fell in love with her unmarried nephew-in-law, Paul.</p>
<p>Later, Paul broke off with Alice, the married woman, for the sake of his fiancée's happiness, who was already pregnant. Jia Ke also abandoned the dancer halfway due to a so-called discovery of conscience to rekindle the ashes of love, and Alice actually allowed him to repaint her broken sad eyebrows.</p>
<p>Here, the author painstakingly made a reformist sermon, but how can it be as ruthless as the facts!</p>
<p>The performance is also not very good. The whole film is loose, not lively, and not tense. Adapted from a stage play - the original author is Vincent Lawrence - but it fails to adopt the compact and concise advantages of stage plays for application in film art, only inheriting the shortcomings of the stage play's monotonous background, lengthy dialogue, and one-line development, such as the pregnancy of the niece, Maggie, and the union of Paul and Maggie, etc., without concise and essential scenes to set off. Even the main key to the reunion of Jia Ke and Alice lacks the necessary and sufficient process, relying entirely on dialogue to advance the plot, which is not a good technique of film art.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are also some commendable aspects, such as the music, which plays a very good role here. When Alice returns from a night party and receives cold treatment from her husband, and strolls in the moonlight, the melancholy and desolate music silently conveys the inner feelings of this boudoir woman. When Paul kisses her, a tune that seems to be happy in sadness is played, but it quickly turns into a melancholy tone as her skirt is torn. This exchange of music and moonlight poetically expresses the mood and changes experienced by the characters in the play. However, when the author uses the dance music of the club to stimulate the heroine at the end, as the key to her change of heart, it is too abrupt and comical after she just said, "Champagne is good, but unfortunately youth is no longer, and love is tired and old."</p>
<p>Other examples include the use of Paul tearing Alice's skirt to symbolize the breakdown of their love. When Alice eats dinner alone, the long candle shadows and candle tears are used to express her sorrow in the dream and disillusionment of love. And the small things like inserting flowers in a vase also show the discord between husband and wife, all of which are lovely little cleverness.</p>
<p>Weaving the dancing and healing section of the dancer before the game is simply clumsy and superfluous, which can be cleverly inserted in the middle.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Diana Wynyard and Clive Brook are not as successful as in "Random World and Autumn", but the former is better. Arthur Hoyt, who plays the male servant Philip, performs quite well.</p>
<h3>Film &amp; Comics Telephone</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Someone asked: "Why do critics have to force an artist to draw materials from the reality around him, instead of letting him create his kingdom in his rich ideals?"</p>
<p>Then comes an arbitrary conclusion that only a few people who, like them, do not fully understand the essence of art will believe, "The greatness of an artist does not lie in his ability to faithfully imitate reality."</p>
<p>Yes, the greatness of an artist does not lie in his ability to faithfully "imitate" (?) reality, but in his ability to correctly analyze reality, understand reality, and see through reality!</p>
<p>Anyone with a little cultivation will not deny that art is a reflection of objective existence, and no one will deny the possibility of explaining art with life. Only works that are closer to life and more authentic can move people's hearts more.</p>
<p>Some say that the greatness of an artist lies in his ability to use his genius and learning to create a realm of reality, so that the common people, no, so that a few gentlemen can gain a moment of liberation in their narrow reality.</p>
<p>However, may I ask, can a work of art be created by relying solely on an artist's genius and learning? At least, he has to express something, and these things are the reflection of objective existence through the author's concepts.</p>
<p>Even the bull-headed horse-faced, Frankenstein, the fat doctor's jade legs, and everything that gentlemen love are by no means things that an artist can imagine out of thin air using only his genius and learning, but are all reflections of objective existence through the writer's concepts.</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3>Words on "Rebirth Flower"</h3>
<p>— Er Yin</p>
<p>"Sister Flowers" once captured the general public, and "Rebirth Flower" still captures the general public.</p>
<p>The content unfolds as expected, and everything is suitable for most viewers, such as the elderly and women...</p>
<p>The director's surgery is naturally very brilliant. As for the control of the structure, I think the passage in which Wang Xianzhai gets money from Fang Dabao and the others is very appropriate, taking advantage of people's unexpectedness to make the audience stunned until the confession under the stairs.</p>
<p>The actors, Hu Die and Xuan Jinglin, show no signs of disappointment at all. Wang Xianzhai and Tan Zhiyuan are excellent. The latter especially exerts his talents as much as possible, and Mei Xi and Zhao Yue are also competent.</p>
<p>One thing that makes people feel a little short of perfection: Zheng Xiaoqiu, who plays Tao Ge, is too that. He simply doesn't know how to perform more profoundly. In the whole play, only the scene of getting drunk is more competent.</p>
<p>"Catching people, catching people" exposes the oppression of the revolutionary army by the warlords in the past, making people feel that the progressive youth at that time were really extremely painful. I was especially moved by this point.</p>
<p>"Rebirth Flower" this tail, after all, did not backfire, this is what I am offering to the Mingxing Company to celebrate.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Forsaking All Others (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Produced by MGM of the United States, starring Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, etc.</p>
<p>By this time tomorrow, she will be Mrs. Dylan Duda. This seems unbelievable, but it is true. At this time, Mary Clay was lying comfortably on the massage bed in her magnificent bedroom, letting the masseuse named Bella beat and support her. While lying down, she counted the past. She had loved Dylan since she was seven or eight years old. She, Dylan, and another, Jeffrey Williams, grew up together. They were close friends, childhood sweethearts, and like brothers and sisters. Speaking of Dylan's character, he was naturally unrestrained and had never had any sorrows. No matter what happened, he would always laugh and not take it seriously. At that time, Mary was a little girl with long legs, big eyes, and fluffy hair. Her liking for Dylan was because of his natural generosity. Jeffrey's nature was much more serious. From a young age, he showed a thoughtful attitude. He was always by Mary's side. When she fell and hurt her kneecap, he was always there to comfort her. When there was a fight, he always protected her. Sometimes, when Dylan unintentionally offended her, Jeffrey was always there to comfort her.</p>
<p>Later, everyone grew up. Jeffrey also went out to Spain. He said he was going to make a fortune, he said with a smile. Dylan, on the other hand, was still happily happy, carefree, plus elegant, talented, and easy to win the hearts of women... Not bad, he had a lingering woman in Paris, but now it has been left behind. In less than twenty-four hours, he will marry Mary Clay. In Mary's mind, there is only this thing that makes her feel thrilling. She is now covered with a thick layer of ointment on her face, and her fluffy hair is tied to the side with a ribbon, but in less than twenty-four hours, she will be a bride. At this time, Bella also did not know what to think, occasionally lost in thought, and patted Mary heavily on the back. Mary was taken aback and shouted, "Hey, Bella, be careful... I don't want to see in tomorrow's newspaper: The newly married is so beautiful, her back is blue and purple, mottled and grotesque..." Bella angrily threw Mary's braids aside, and then said, "Blue or purple, black or yellow, it's too boring to get married." She said, supporting hard, Mary did not say a word, let her arrange.</p>
<p>After a while, the door opened, Mary leaned over, half climbed up, Paula jumped in. Paula is petite and exquisite, dressed like a foreign doll, always jumping when walking. Mary almost brought her up since she was a child. When she saw Mary lying on the bed, Bella was beating her, she couldn't help opening her mouth and shouting, "Mary! Your wedding is about to begin, why are you still lying there and letting someone beat you? Bella, don't beat her! Everyone in the house is waiting for you to go down! Why are you lying there as if nothing happened... I bought things all afternoon, everything is done, my waist is going to be paralyzed. What? You think I haven't seen a wedding before?" Mary said with a smile, "Baby Paula, I can't do without you, I simply can't do it. You must know these things..." Bella pretended to sigh, "How can she not know? Didn't she already bury three men?" Bella has been working under Paula for a long time, so it doesn't matter if she is more presumptuous. Paula was not angry at all, she also said, "You're wrong. I only buried two husbands. I don't know where the third one went." Bella said, "Probably he went to foreign exile." Paula ignored her and just looked at Mary and asked her happily, "Happy?" Mary said, "No, I feel like I'm going to die or faint before I walk in front of the altar." Paula reminisced about her own experience and comforted her, "It doesn't matter. The first time is always like this." But someone was knocking on the door outside, interrupting Paula's words. (To be continued)</p>
