<h3>防止自殺與改造心理</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>本市社會局吳局長對防止自殺問題。發表意見。主張從改造心理與實力援助兩方下手。誠屬精到之論。茲就改造心理一點。再申論之。</p>
<p>就一般觀察。自殺心理之構成不外由於經濟的困難或戀愛的失敗。然自來社會學者及心理學者皆謂自殺原因。並不如常人所說之簡單。蓋就經濟困難言。社會之中。經濟困難者至少十有八九。其欲訴諸自殺手段者。實百不得一。再則原始社會其生活之艱苦較之進步社會。相去何啻天壤。然原始社會。自殺之事。幾於絕無。就此可知單純的經濟困難决非驅人自殺之絕對原因更就戀愛失敗言。當今社會。失戀之事。决不在少。然能忍受此種打擊者。實佔多數。以此而論。經濟困難與戀愛失敗。雖能驅人於自殺。然必其不能忍受此種遭遇百又無法解除精神上之痛苦者始出此末途。可斷言也。</p>
<p>據法國社會學者寶爾幹之研究自殺之原因。由於自我中心觀念之發達。而心理分析學者則多謂自我慾望（包括性慾與權力慾）遭受壓抑。每使人流於精神反常失望悲觀怨憤壓世以至自殺之途本此二說。可明自殺心理之由矣。原始社　。羣的意識高於個人自我觀念並不發達故凡文明人認爲屈辱痛苦失望之事。在原始人往往絕無此類感覺。此原始社會之所以缺乏自殺現象也。現代社會中之貧苦大眾。自我慾望不甚强烈食色而外每無其他奢望。如名譽光榮權勢地位等之需求。亦不深切。　其如是。　自殺之專以事業失敗。驟遭破產。家道中落者居多。而素處貧賤者。反不常見。即以最近滬上　生之舉家自殺案百論。自殺者張月鑫固　道素封者。而岳霖往日亦曾月賺一百五十元。且在天津置有相當房產可知此　自殺案中之原因。決無生存之餘地特其對於人世。失望怨恨過甚。對於自己遭遇過於　憤。始使其以自殺　解除痛苦唯一之辦法。質言之。自殺原因卽共個性過　。虛榮心過盛。自殺觀念過於發達。更觀岳霖之供　被平日對於親友往往不願告貸請託可知其虛榮心與自我觀念。亦甚强烈。以如是之性格處於如是惡劣之環境下。勢必因刺激過甚百流於精神失常。因精神失常而才能適應社會。終至以自殺爲唯一之歸宿也。</p>
<p>反之。凡人之能去其自我觀念而代以「社會觀念」「國家觀念」或竟全以人類之福相爲中心去。則無論如何歷盡艱辛。歷盡苦難。仍必百折不撓。全力以赴。我人　觀古今中外思想上政治上制度上之革命家。其所遭命運。幾於無一不堅苦卓絕。令人景仰。然鮮聞有憤懣自殺者。此蓋革命家之心理與自殺者逈然不同。革命家不以個人　已之幸福爲目的。而以社會國家竟或整個人類之幸福爲對象。易　言之。彼有彼之特殊使命。使命本　成。彼固不能死也。又如今之甘地。爲賤　爭公道。彼可絕食數十日。而於其一已之幸福。在往絕不一顧。試思長期之絕食與一時之自殺。兩者何難。殊爲顯然。然甘地寗屢次絕食。而未嘗有自殺之意。此非厚愛其生特欲留此身以爲社會人羣造福耳。故人而真能不以個人爲中心。而以社會國家或人羣爲中心。則無論生活如何艱苦。必不輕於一死也。</p>
<p>此層道理。對於失戀者。亦能適用。凡專以一已之幸福爲前提者。失戀之後。往往極度懊喪。馴致趨於自殺之一途。唯其能念及父兄培植之苦心。顧及一已對於社會國家人羣之責任者。則必不因失戀而殺身。故不論經濟的自殺。或失戀的自殺。其起因卽在以自我爲中心。茍能擴而大之。以人羣之福利爲鵠的。則如墨翟之磨頂方踵可也。如基督之被迫害而無怨亦可也。如近代革命者之以牢獄爲生活亦可也。如甘地之屢屢絕食。不喪其生亦可也。</p>
<p>我人就此可知心理改造。對於防止自殺。實屬必要。然則心理如何改造乎。具體言之。即消極方面。節制物質的慾望。消除虛榮的心理。積極方面。則發揚大無畏的精神。而以博愛代替褊狹的自我觀念。</p>

<h3>英德海軍談話　將於星期四復開</h3>
<p>（巴黎）今日法報載稱、英德兩國將在原則上成立海軍協定、以作將來歐洲海軍條約之基礎、大約德國準備讓步、允分期逐漸實施其造艦程序、並允限制各艦噸數、迨此協定原則成立後、法國交有發言之機會、預料一般妥協非一時所能成就、因法國對於其所認爲必要之事件、將有許多意見發表也云、惟巴黎迴聲報所發議論、與此不同、據謂如華盛頓海軍條約不於今年內重新成立、而英美日三國又起造艦競爭發、則德國海軍標準自將增高、是以百分之三十五之比率足以解決因德國恢復海權而起之問題（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英德間之海軍談話、因聖靈降臨節而停者、將於星期四日復開、屆時希特勒專使里賓特羅浦及德海軍專家將重來倫敦、里賓特羅浦在此假期中已向德元首報告倫敦談話之結果、衆料協定草稿行將擬成、內載英德間關於相對的海軍力量之諒解、即德國海軍等於英國海軍百分之二十五是也、（十二日路逐電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）英國政府最近曾照會法國政府、報告英德海軍談話經過之情形、此次照會、現正由外交部及海軍部會同研究、俟明日國務會議決定以後、即起草後文、送交英國政府、據消息靈通方面所稱、英德海軍談話之結果、英國始已許可德國海軍噸數佔英國百分之三十五、惟此項總噸數、德國究作如何分配、是否每種軍艦、均依此種比例建造、則頗爲英國所惶慮、因此英國方面、亟欲諗悉德國海軍造艦之詳細計畫、德國海軍代表里本德洛甫現返柏林、不久後來倫敦、大約將向英政府提出有利之答復、聞法國政府、對於德國海軍造艦之詳細計畫、亦亟求聞知、按各海軍國預定在華盛頓海約滿期以前、舉行海軍會議、如對德成立海軍協定、則對於未來海軍會議、究有何種影響、此層在目前尚屬一無所知、且英法意諸國倘准許德國建造海軍、則無異承認凡爾賽和約第五部分之完全變更、此亦爲一困難之問題、不寗唯是、上彈人士更以爲對德海軍談判、必須與二月三日倫敦宣言書所規定之各項談話同時舉行、蓋其他各項安全公約、倘未加以討論、則德國海軍問題、殊無最後解決之可能也、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>黑山縣　黑山偽縣當局、雖有禁止輸出糧石公文、但事實幷未辦到、且貯藏極少、一般民衆、極感糧食缺乏之恐怖、</p>
<p>朝陽縣　朝陽偽縣當局、尙未有禁止輸出穀類及其他具體善後辦法、故民情異常惶恐、</p>
<p>西安縣　西安偽縣當局、已下禁止糧穀輸出之偽令、但實際則反是、原於五月上旬堆積高梁尙有一萬石、然至六月上旬、卽减少六千石、故民食亦甚感不足、（東北社）</p>

<h3>農村復興會彭學沛發表　自給自足經濟政策　挽救國民經濟現今危機　只有向這路上急起直追</h3>
<p>新聲社云、農村復興委員會秘書處主任彭學沛最近中央黨部廣播電台、發表中國自給自足的經濟政策、新　社記者摘記其要點如下、</p>
<p>中國本來是大然可以自給自足的國家但是因爲工業不發達、製造品便大部份黨從外國輸入、又因爲種種的原故農產品也有不少的部份靠從外國輸入、釀成了國民經濟上現今的這種危機、要挽救這危機、只有向自給自足的路上急起直追我們如果採用自給自足的經濟政策、有幾個要點必須注意（一）必須定下一個步驟、工業品農產品通統一下了就辦到自給自足那是不可能的、工業的發達、不是可以一蹴而成的、惟有農業、在我國本來是發達的、雖然我們現在還不能應用科學、但我國農耕方怯的精到和農民經騐的豐富、在現今歐美人士還是很稱贊的我們如果先從農產品做起、做到農產品的自給自足縣是很容易的、但只要農產品自給自足入超也就沒有了、（二）必須實行計書經濟、在世界情勢這樣不安定中　經濟危機如此嚴重的時候、任其自然的經濟政策是來不及的、我們想要迅速見效、必須用政府的力量去一面計畫、一面統制最初就是相當的調查研究的工夫、其次就要用政府的力量去改良生產再其次就要用政府的力量去便利運銷、這些都是應該由政府負起責來、切實去做不能任其自然的（三）四分工業六分農業、有些人說、中國是以農立國、這句話我是不懂的、怎樣呌做立國、怎樣呌做以農立國意義是極含混的、也可以解釋爲事實問題、只說中國現今人口百分之八十靠農業吃飯、這是實在的、也可以解釋爲理想問題、便說中國人應當重農應當以從　農業爲理想的職業、這就很有討論的餘地了、又可以解釋爲哲學問題便談到什麼立國精神及先王之治之類、把中國古來的政治制度哲學思想和整個文化都締結到一個農字上去、那就玄之又玄了、因此就引起是否應該以工立國的疑問、怎麼呌做以工立國、也是難得下定義的、中國必須發展工業那是毫無疑義的、但是有了那麼廣大的土地、有了那麼多世代業農的人口、農業在中國的國民經濟上、在很長的期間內總是占很重要的地位、所以重工不重農、在事實上也是辦不到的、在歐洲有些國家農工並重、如法蘭西波蘭諸國、據說、籠統說來、約略是四分工業六分農業、這雖然也是極含混的說、但是從自給自足的經濟政策說來、這實是中國將來理想的經濟狀况、換句話說、就是我們希望將來中國工業品、大致能自給自足農業品也不致能自給自足而中國在自然的條件上、還眞備這種資格可以希望實現、（四）工商業要分散全國、人口過於集中都市、是各先進國大家都很顧盧的問題都市的壞處、是大家都過的汚穢逼窄的不衛生的生活、並且都傳染那都市所必然附帶的惡劣的習慣、農村的好處、是不但有益於體格的健康而且可以養成樸素質直和平等之美德、人口集中都市的結果、國家便失掉大部分健全人口的供給、其次工商業因此也就集中於極少數的都市、例如我國工商業差不多完全把重心放在上海、這都楚在國防上極危險的事體、歐洲各國已經發現了這些弊害、但是木已成舟、不容易改造、我國建設開始的時候、應該心目中有一個新的印象、應該闢一條新的路徑、要充分利甩各地的地力人力、要使都市相農討相輔而行、互相輔助、</p>

<h3>雨水失調　洋米續漲杜粳堅挺</h3>
<p>洋米昨日市況續形挺俏、因雨水不勻、各地均在　旱、江浙內地去歲已遭旱災之禍、今年更為恐慌、昨雖無長江　繼續辦裝、而內地去胃更活、本街續有應酬、因出市上空氣依然緊張、西貢　三號為本街及江浙內地爭辦、行情步漲五分、其進亦均帶俏、如今明去化再旺、或再無透雨、則米價勢必再度上升也、全日開出西貢米　萬多包、小絞邏　各來六十包、客秈七百四十五包、去化仍以內地為主云、</p>
<p>本米（滬南）昨日各幫來源共到三十號、（貨共近一千石）、本街銷場呆滯、包胃不見停辦、故大局形勢復轉軟態、　南港早稻價貶落角砠、各晚稻低尺外、僅蘇同幫粳以到源較少、獨見平定、陰變元仍無榮辱、（滬北）昨河下各路來船十六七號、市上各貨去胃依然淡弱、各方因天時亢旱、致不願賤脫、市價白粳又轉挺立、白元及旱薄趨定勢、　　各花　無甚上落、</p>
<h3>油豆行市俱少進展</h3>

<h3>糖市　太古糖未肯隨</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以銷路仍淡、趨勢　　、公會划盤、二四粗砂白現貨以十六元一角、成交數十包、比前日降去　包、　口貨呌小五分、為五元　角半、亦少受乎、太古糧　胃　少、未肯隨降、B　以十七元四角稍　划出、本　綿白振裕一號　五元半無變動、二　四號照　本廠　紫水仍呌二十元六角、二號二十元半、惟暗盤略降、國　潮青僅　叫盤、如提莊青十元六角、黃閣青十元四角、隆港青九元六角、均未成盤、東白續有划出八號為十五元九角、四號十六元、比前盤小去一角、東赤十二元、</p>
<h3>東糖進口為量最多</h3>
<p>據上海商品檢騐局檢騐統計之結果、五月份進口之糖以日本為最多、砂糖　千零一公擔半、車白糧六萬三千三百五十一公擔、赤糖三萬　千九百七十公擔、由爪哇來者、砂糖八萬四千七百零二公擔、由香港來砂糖　千七百五十一公擔、車白糖　千六百五十八擔九十四公斤、其他糖八百七十七公擔、由美國來者有砂糧　十七公擔、赤糖十擔八十九公斤、其他四十三公擔、合計砂糖有八萬八千四百八十七公擔九十七公斤、車白糖六萬六千零零九公擔九十七公斤、赤糖一萬三千九百八十一公擔、其他九百　公擔、</p>
<h3>絲茶　祁門花香俄銷轉暢</h3>
<p>祁門花香紅茶、近兩晶來、俄莊協助、洋行進意頓濃、英商怡和協和同孚天裕等行、亦均紛起搜辦、連日成效額數共達五千七百　箱、售價均在二十元左右、與粗莊紅茶市盤相仿、因其天然質料尚佳、較兩湖寗州各路貨易於走銷、至綠茶市面、昨無　大變動、路莊珍　針眉絲茶、交易尚不寂寞、怕低莊次貨、仍無大宗銷路云、</p>
<h3>五金　薄馬口鐵有西安幫採辦</h3>
<p>薄馬口鐵、自涸　幫停辦後、面玩具　又不收買、市勢呆木、標準開價異常軟弱、每箱衹售四十八元、　近西安幫及本埠餅乾廠等、忽爭相收買、開出六七十箱、其價每箱售四十九元、比前亦好起一元、聞此貨新近裝來不多、而滬存亦薄、故市氣與人心均是穩固、</p>

<h3>學生服用國貨之有效辦法</h3>
<p>— 潘嘉瑜</p>
<p>爲國民的應當服用國貨，已人人知道，豈有爲智識階級代表之學生，反而不盡力推行服用嗎？共中亦不無理由可述，的言之有下列幾種：</p>
<p>（一）一班低級學生未能深察其貨物之爲國貨或外貨。</p>
<p>（二）商人之無商業道德者，每以外貨假稱國貨。</p>
<p>（三）關于某一外貨或未知有同樣之國貨。</p>
<p>（四）一時對物品之價格低廉而忽略。</p>
<p>理由旣如上述、的言之即爲不良商人之蒙蔽和學生本身之疏忽、故學生之未能盡責服用國貨，亦未便卽加以「不愛國」的稱謂，實在因爲國貨推行方法未臻完善而有效也。</p>
<p>然所謂有效辦法，卽不尙空談，有具體辦法，從事實施，而爲避免以上四項事實計：一方使學生避免受愚，一方使對于所用貨物能確定其爲國貨，茲爲實行此點，必須有有組織、有系統之學生聯合消費合作社，今就臆見，陳述其組織及辦法之大概，爲實施之參考。</p>
<p>此項合作社須由學生方面主動的組合，或由國貨業團體予以相當之臂助、其起始可由某一學校發起，邀集各校之代表，糾織籌備事宜，再由各中學校以上之學生自治會選派委員、而低級學校，可由敎師中派定委員，共同組織委員會，辦理進行，同時又分組監察委員會，以督察委員會之進行事項。</p>
<p>此委員會之職責，爲組合消費合作社，卽採用信託業之代辦制度，惟不抽傭金，一方面與誠實可信之商家或廠家接洽，以最適宜之價格及最可確信之國貨進行貿易。一方面應學生之須要妥爲代辦應用貨品，所謂學生之應用貨品，可分爲文具，衣服，及其他用品三類，茲各就其性質而分討之：</p>
<p>（一）文具　文具對學生之關係，實無時不在應用，其消費額最大，所以爲漏巵之源頭亦最大，然辨別其爲外貨或國貨則甚難，因爲外貨之利用“Made　inChina”者不可勝計，以至使人無可斷定，並且價目大半不貴，有時購買者易於忽略而不加深察。今欲推行此項國貨之文具起見，可利用學校固有之小商店加以改革，可由各該學校學生集股糾合，卽以此項資本批進所需之文具，其進辦貨品須經合作社委員會之檢騐，及由該會派一駐校常委，以資調查或報吿。</p>
<p>（二）衣服　學生衣服原料，若求盡用國貨，則手續上很難進行，因各學生之衣服原料，大致不同，故欲冀其服用國貨，則以實行校服制爲唯一辦法，其進行可先由此項合作社之委員會函吿各學校當局，允爲代辦，由該校當局選定顏色及質料之如何，價格之範圍等要伴後，由該委員會妥爲選擇最經濟而優良品質之國貨，使學生購製，一律穿用。</p>
<p>（三）其他用具　其他如藝術上及技術上之應用物品，如照相機，印字機等，此類用具，亦可由該合作社代辦，不過其方法略異，先由委託購買人提呈委購意見書、（註明物品名稱，種類，式樣及價格之範圍等）向該社委員會申請代購，及付以相當定購金，由該委員會允以幾日辦到，然後付足餘欵取貨。</p>
<p>舉凡以上三項，苟能見之實施，其成效必有可觀，其利益有三：</p>
<p>一，在原則上可以推行國貨。</p>
<p>二，在實際上學生經濟方面可節省</p>
<p>三，此組織成功，可予學生以良好辦事實習，及學生間關係日漸密切，以養成團結性。</p>
<h3>國人應注意的三件事</h3>
<p>— 潘伊士</p>
<p>一年容易，二十四年度又將過去一半的日子了，今年定是學生國貨年、當時各學校的代表，宣誓服用國貨的情形，至今還歷歷然像在眼前的樣子。關於提倡國貨的文字，本刊曾經載過有好多的篇數了，就統盤看來，我想成績不致於會再蹈婦女國貨年的覆轍了吧！</p>
<p>因爲學生都是年靑有爲，血氣方剛的靑年，是有智識而富於熱情的。所以實行的效果不會使人怎樣失望，可是有幾點，我們應該格外注意的，特地提出來供諸位討論。</p>
<p>第一，轉移審美觀念。大凡中國人都有一種通病，就是以爲外國人製的東西什麼都好，臂如人家問某甲這件物品是什麼地方買的，某甲一定回答是惠羅或永安等大公司，這樣方始可以表示他的闊綽。這種流弊是錯誤的，我們非但不要榮尙奮侈，更不必一味的去信仰洋貨，應當以樸實爲要囷。對於一叨事物同日常生活，祇求精神上得到安慰相愉樂。不必斤斤乎求物質上的享受同滿足；我們當以購買國貨爲光榮、大家一致去消極抵抗洋貨，那怕洋貨拚命的來傾銷，而把自己的商塲給人家佔去呢？</p>
<p>第二；丟開虛榮觀念，大家養成實事求是的習慣。一般人多被虛榮延誤終身，致不可救藥的地步，非但權利喪失，甚至於國破家亡、這是很大的原因，我們今後應當丟開虛榮心、把這種精神放到國家的福利上去、方才可以解决什麽困難的事情。</p>
<p>第三，憑良心做事，一般人都是掛羊頭買狗肉，表面上講得體貼入微，我們應該愛國、應當提倡國貨，挽回利權，而實際上呢？自己仍舊做一一洋貨的推銷員，簡接就是在賣國，這樣埋沒良心做事，是千萬不應該的。</p>
<p>我們能够注意到以上三點，努力做去，我想不到十年、包你國富民强，什麼不景氣的影響不會再度侵襲到我們的境界裏來。</p>
<h3>南京國貨公司之週會</h3>
<p>— 石鳴</p>
<p>——意義頗可效法——</p>
<p>南京國貨公司。於去歲雙十節開幕。營業甚爲發達。創辦之始。推前市長石瑛任董事長。石氏持躬淸廉。平日布衣粗服。致力提倡國貨。故尤樂助厥成。經理葛亮疇。精明幹練。辦事極爲認眞。管理內部。卓著勞績。業務因以蒸蒸日上。</p>
<p>居商界而欲冀事業之發展成功。第一。固在經營之得法。所謂操算計贏。綢繆規劃。必須時刻用心。迎頭趕上。使售品勿失時效。週轉便於靈通。然後於事有濟。第二。卽在人事管理之適當。無管理卽無計劃。而管理上過於謹嚴。失之呆板。寂無生機。過於寬弛。又易流於放誕。影響職務。欲寬猛相濟。剛柔並用。是在經理之能具有時代學識。認淸事業本身與環境。以專一精神對付。通權達變而不妨害事功。庶乎其可。</p>
<p>南京國貨公司於人事管理方面。有一點頗可紀述。每逢星期二淸晨七時半。（該公司照例每日八時半啟門營業）。由經理召集全體職員。在二樓舉行每週談話會。談話的範圍，以發展業務促巡服務精神爲主旨。包刮商人道德靑年進修諸問題。對國貨之何種爲銷路呆滯。何種爲迎合需要。自亦隨時加以探討。參加之職員。均得發表意見。以消除隔閡。融洽感情之集會方式。從事實質之剖解。理智之判斷。以求本身業務之策進。此種辦法。其意義實屬可取。葛君　謂商界最忌經理與職員。各因地位上關係。彼此不相交談。儼然劃分鴻濤。以　影響服務效能。釀成無形之損失　人謀不减。良可嘆息。萬君本此經騐之談。繼能產生合法之管理。同時處處以身作則。言論動作精神，貫。事業前途。自然順序推進。</p>
<p>時代進化。商業知識更必須有相當具備，才可應付裕如。居今日而為一業之領袖。則如何完備此領袖資格之條件。使業有所成事有所歸。實一先决問題。著者絕非以私人淺見。標榜萬君之所長。惟以南京國貨公司。爲首都商業之巨擘。其畢行週會意義。足資管理上便利。於身心事業。均多裨益　似可供全國商業界採作楷模，不妨爲之傳述。最後還希效法者加以注意。如果亦舉行每週談話會。其動機應出之聯絡感情交換意見。幸勿如長官之訓話。反致索然無味。喪失意義也。</p>

<h3>上海國貨公司倒閉後的感想</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>廢歷端午，不幸的噩耗續續而來！在國貨界有相當努力的上海國貨公司、竟以倒閉聞　這不能不使人扼腕！感到一件痛心的事　當茲外貨傾銷—侵略內地急迫之秋！我國貨界的陣綫，再起了搖動，不是完了嗎？誠然，國貨公司拖欠了債權者的錢，已屆節關，是不容馬虎過去的，可是欠債事小，而消滅一著稱的國貨機關，斵喪國貨界原氣！影響整個商市！斷絕職工生機！增加社會失業者，其事更顯得異常嚴重！</p>
<p>其次：創辦國貨公司的股東，主持國貨事業的經理人，應該反躬猛省的是；第一，應專心業務的籌劃，不兼他職，第二，勵精圖治，脚踏實地的苦幹，國貨如何推銷，用人如何嚴格，開支如何緊縮，經濟如何鞏固，持籌握算昕夕不遑！更何心於外務？</p>
<p>鄔志君豪之魄力！吾人應當佩服，然而他的兼職不專，散漫無計，無謂的舖張揚　！不求實際之充實　是其大病！前車覆，後車鑑！經營國貨事業者、其亦知悚然以懼　惕然以儆否耶？</p>
<h3>參觀文光牌複寫紙工塲記</h3>
<p>— 欽希</p>
<p>一天，我往某書局文具部購複寫紙　店員問：要外國複寫紙，還是中國複寫紙。我聽了，非常駭怪。複寫紙，祇有舶來品，難道也有中國貨嗎？當時，就回答那店員，要中國複寫紙。他就取出一盒來給我看。只見那盒的外表作深藍色，盒面有「請用國貨文光牌複寫紙上海文光工藝社」等字樣。不禁很興奮地檢出複寫紙來觀察，表面不過爾爾。好在價錢僅需大洋七角，就購了一盒，携歸試寫。咦！還眞不錯。細細地查看盒子裏面說明，才知道該文光工藝社，在上海華德路慧源里。</p>
<p>我雖不是一個十二三歲的兒童，但是好奇心比較任何人來得厲害。怎樣制造複寫紙，我要知道一點大概　就在上星期六的下午　趁着無事，乘十路公共汽車，往文光工藝社參觀。該社在慧源里的第二弄，門上有「工場重地閒人莫入」的琺瑯牌子，不便敲門進去。可是貼鄰的一家門首，另有「文光工藝社」的琺瑯牌一塊，就舉起手來敲那銅環。不到一分鐘，裏邊走出一位五十歲左右的老年人，招呼我進去，問有什麽事幹。我就取出名卡一紙，說明特來參觀工塲。他幷不拒絕，且有表示歡迎的語氣。寒暄畢，就領導我去領略。只見那工塲熱氣騰騰，有十來個工人正在努力工作。下列問答，就是我所得到的一點新智識、</p>
<p>（問）貴社是幾時創辦的？</p>
<p>（答）發起於民國二十三年十月，於同年十二月一日開設的。</p>
<p>（問）貴社資本若干，股東有多少，是否公司性質？</p>
<p>（答）資本僅化幾千塊錢，股東不過四五人，事實上可稱兩合公司名義。</p>
<p>（問）這種製造方法，是從外國學來的，還是自己發明的？</p>
<p>（答）外國的製造複寫紙，用很複雜的機器印刷的。這種機器，價値很貴，我們資本不多，此刻暫用人工。將來擴充時，必須利用機器。但是現在的人工製造，已經多方研究所得的結果了</p>
<p>（問）製造複寫紙，用什麽原料，此種原料，　自什麽地力，能告知我嗎？</p>
<p>（答）我們所用的原料，種類很多，像司替林，拍拉芬，甘汕，燥油，炭酸鈉等，不勝枚舉。這些東西，有的到西藥行去購，有的到原料行去購。不過絕對避購劣貨，這是可以質諸天日的。</p>
<p>（問）那麽，市上流行的紙類，劣貨很多，你們也能够一律避免嗎？</p>
<p>（答）這是有色皮上的牌子可以證明的，你不信，請同到事務所裏給證據你看，便</p>
<p>說到這裏，又同到先前的那間屋子中。他就在抽屜內取出一包紙來，檢出許多紙招牌，像捷克斯拉夫的牌子，德國的百貝樂司紙廠牌子，經理挪威的漢記洋行劉海商標多種。我對於紙類，本係門外漢，經此一席談，才知道西洋各國的造紙廠，確是非常的偉大。再要問下去，壁上的電話，鈴聲可可而響。我就道謝出門。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （菱湖昭）</p>
<p>嚴格地說，一人生」無非是一生，老，病，死」而已矣。如其把個人和國家及社會間所發生的一切關係來加以討論，不管你幹偉大的救國事業，或是家庭隣里的瑣碎事故，非在二十歲左右時候，把普通學識的基礎打定不行！</p>
<p>不然，到了近四五十歲腦力衰弱的時候，再來打定普通學識的根基、那是來不及了，是不是？</p>
<p>老實說，我們一到四五十歲，孔子所謂「不足畏」的時候，血氣那有少壯時的旺呢？這時的目標，祇有一味幹幹「老，病，死」的工作。其實，打開天窗說亮話，這工作，無非想弄點錢來爲將來的地步着想呵！</p>
<h3>一垜墻壁（上）</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在這紙上瞧「淸壁運動一四個字，腦海裏便會幻現出我們貴國的街上常見的一垜墻壁。</p>
<p>本來是一垜很好的墻壁，它受那風吹雨打和苔蘚斑駁而損壞，而汚穢，那是無可如何的事情。偏偏我們的墻壁，前幾天是簇新的，不多幾大，加上了種種人工的塗抹裝飾，竟會變成了一幅光怪陸離的古畫；而且十足地顯現着種種的惡根性來。</p>
<p>明明寫着「禁止招貼」四個大字，上邊那金碧輝煌的戲院子預報，以及商店大减價大拍賣的廣告，密密的貼滿了一厚層，褐下來竟可當一條蓆子用。下邊是寫着，禁止小便如違送捕一等字句：或是塗着蠻大的一隻烏龜，可是墻脚根黃黃的尿迹，一股刺鼻的臭味，竟像是一種招人小便的標幟。以上兩種的事實，是吿訴人們「明知故犯不顧公德」的惡習。</p>
<p>還有咧！狹狹的紅紅的紙條上，寫着「出賣重傷風」見便成功一，或是「天黃黃地黃黃我家有個哭兒郎仁人君子念一遍一夜睡到大天光。這種巫現式和損人不利己的口吻，十足表現着人民常識的缺乏。</p>
<p>紅紅綠綠的招貼，刻着「××堂包醫楊梅白濁」的字樣，也佔據了墻壁中行的地位，這在表示着我們的「娼道大明十有九病」的現象、</p>
<p>街頭的流浪兒，閒着沒事，也在墻壁上畫着粗綫條和不成形的模特兒；還寫着「××小五車××十骨頭」等口號，這又可以表示着我們的社會敎育和兒童敎育。</p>
<p>這般的墻壁，豎立在街頭，仔細地去賞鑒下，眞呌人哭笑不得咧！</p>
<h3>夏屋品茶記</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>立夏前一日，造糞翁寓，値亭午，共飯焉。晴日鬱空院、雲定不風：略進盃中物，四肢感綿軟，相約作宰予寢。及醒，殘暉掛簷。觀雙白兎爭食菜葉：目如紅寶石，掀長耳，翕翕動；顋頰隨之。爲意甚適，忽思茶，用寫蕭閒。乃憶夏兄宜滋，不與見者且二載，方懸壺北京路，兼賣印泥；而仍以茶皇帝覇海上。時叔範亦至，遂三人行，徑達夏屋。少間，宜滋出，握手高談。之四子者，在雅俗兩非間，圍坐方桌，潔壺盤，滌盃皿，先試「明前。」宜滋役於茶有年，習如刀圭然；出其絕藝，滴茶皿中，雖盈不溢。未刺鼻也，淸香已至；未及唇也，舌津已生：以是知水之來，必自虎跑；產茶之地，必在獅峯，虎跑臘泉，封藏可三載不壞；獅峯之葉，　一旂之長與槍等，縱差不累栗，信已，旋試「荷花，」氳氤釅烈，鎖顎不散。儼雨後江亭，靜對新荷，玉環不語，溪客生愁，凝眸遠念，宛水中央。非往葬何哉？殿以野茶」，產自靑海，歲收二三斤，蓋無采藥翁繫練飛空，窮高極奧，無由得也。其色紅，其味醇，亦甘而紉，可以二三十泡，味不小變，色不小褪，意其生處危巓，受霜露之精多，故神奇至於斯極！試凡三品，每品二試：「明前」得圓，「荷花」得尖，「野茶」得闊。雖然，治茶亦正難言：必也準重輕，適水溫，一時刻，故雖得雲腴鳳爪，泉烹虎跑，不假手於宜滋，則爲味不醇，無宜滋以相對，則品題不雅；品而不得其人，則雖美之而不盡其旨。是說也，官滋聞之，當不河漢？</p>

<p>第十四回　別有悟心西人談建設不無遺憾寒七種相思</p>
<p>有容道；這只管帮他們的忙，沒有錯。窮人有他的窮算盤，那王君果然娶了這姑娘，也許是有辦法的。至於那姑娘能吃苦耐勞，我敢保險，不會有什麼問題。志前見他兩手操了長衣的下擺，提起一變脚來，踏在凳子上，作了一個很雄赳赳的樣子，那一番興奮，可以不必去說。這就笑道；我眞困難。我若促成他的婚姻，在事實上，我覺得不應該。我反對吧？周先生都這樣熱心。有容笑道；本來啊！你在小西天是個老爺，對他又是這樣體恤週到，當然有接近之可能就是王君那番疑心，也是在人情之中。但是在我的眼光裏，却不會這樣想，因爲你爲人志趣很遠大，便是在西安小小的住上幾天，所作的事，也就很多，何至於注意到一個災民身上去。所以王君那種疑忌，我雖認爲當然，我並不疑到程先生身上來。唯其我不疑到程先生身上來所以我就大胆勸程先生玉成其事。程先生，你看我這個意思，說得怎麼樣？說到這裏，不由得笑嘻嘻地，也向志前望着。這樣一來，倒教志前不知道說什麼是好。搔搔頭笑道，你這似乎是個激將法。不過你旣是這樣的熱心，我就勉從尊意，等北海干了，我探探他的口氣。周有容這才放下那條腿，垂着袖子，向他作了幾個揖。（二三八）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>湖上的風景眞是多麼的美麗啊！水是清得像碧玉一樣，我們可以從船上一直看到湖的底裏：那些尙未透出水面的荷梗，也不難一枝枝的數出來。人向這湖水注視半嚮，眼睛霎時就覺光明了幾倍。尤其動人的是湖中所蓄養着的那些五色金魚，時時在綠波中掉尾而過，恍如紅絲一線：有幾尾較大的還會打水面上跳起來，發出淸脆的微音和圓暈的波紋。</p>
<p>陽光絕無偏私地遍罩花我們的身上，使我們充滿了一股活潑的朝氣，人人都忘掉了一切憂患，愁苦，準備盡情的行樂。其時靠着萬濤由築的一帶宮殿，恰好貼對着我們，從船上遠遠地望去，眞像小說中所摹繪的仙山樓閣一般</p>
<p>頤和園內的花木原是很盛的，特別是湖濱一帶，分外的多；高的，矮的，木本的，草本的，眞不知有多少。我們在船上還可以隱約地見到它們隨着風勢，在鮮明的日光中起伏俯仰，同時那陣陣的花香，就因它們這樣的起伏俯仰而不斷的宣洩出來了，偶然吹進我們的鼻孔中來，眞有沁人心脾的快感。（三三八）</p>
<h3>最後一課</h3>
<p>— 輔吉女士</p>
<p>曾於翻過一篇胡適譯的法國名小說家都德的得意作品，「最後一課」，覺得它描寫一個怯國小學生的愛國觀念，深刻而婉諷，比較平舖直叙的那些愛國題材小說要够玩味得多，它寫德兵壓境，戰事敉平以後，這小學生才戚覺到往日可以請國文時候的荒嬉逃學爲不是，而一旦自己醒悟過來，要想再翻上一頁本國文字的書本，早遭人禁止而不可能了。</p>
<p>因爲，亡人國的最後手段，把被亡國家的文化燬滅，竟能把它的史實完全忘去，永久的沉淪，無從去超拔的，這種，都毒辣的手腕，看了小說，尙且會憤慨，痛恨心絃上會得多一種警惕的。</p>
<p>這造紙面的宣示，尙感不能普及，看了明星新片沈西苓導演的「鄉愁」，內中也有「最後一課」的挿曲，使我發覺它的力量，是在都德小說之上的！</p>
<p>外侮頻仍，覺悟其時矣乎？我願大家都得去一視這影片中的「最後一課」，一面可以警惕自己，一面還可以同都德的小說對比一下，究竟在藝術立塲上是誰佔了優勢。好在，「鄉愁」的映期，大約不會過遲的了。</p>

<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>日本的墳墓</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日人流行火葬，將骨灰放在木匣子裏，葬在石塔底下，所以佔地不廣。私人的墳墓很少，大都葬在寺院的附近空地上。日本寺多，也像我國之機，把名山景都佔據完了。山上空地很多，便作爲公共墓地。而日人又都信佛敎，所以寺院又成了他們的墓塲。</p>
<p>石塔的形狀，很像蒙古的喇嘛塔，完全用花崗石堆成。高丈餘，石基約六尺見方，有二三級。上置立方體的石塊，再上面有二三尺高的圓柱，柱頂便是方面的塔頂，形狀和我國的寶塔頂標，是整塊的石頭彫成。圓柱上刻着死者的姓名年歲生卒年月。男的稱居士，女的稱大姊，即我國善男信女之意。骨灰藏於塔下，不易暴露。也有二三人合葬在一個塔內，大部是夭折的兄弟姊妹，他們並沒有夫婦同穴的習慣。</p>
<p>講究的墳墓，可以多出幾個錢，買得較大的地盤。在石塔四周，再圍着石欄。還有在墳前造着庫門，石門石檻。總之從前日人墳墓上的東西，全是石的。現在已有改良，用鐵門和柵欄了。石塔也有用人造石製成的，但是不多。</p>
<p>中等階級以下的墳墓，低得只有三四尺高。有些連石塔也造不起，一槐方石頭上，立着塊小碑。最最貧苦的，在墓地上扦着，根白木方柱，上面寫着姓名就算了。最近我國公墓制漸漸推行，他們也有和公墓同意義的公共納骨堂。由寺院裏造了一個大石塔，下面可以放着無數的骨灰。所需的價格，比購墳地吏低康了</p>
<p>石塔的前面地上，還置着石五製的香爐蠟台。另有挿洋花的石瓶，做子孫的常常要來獻花禱吿燒香蠟的時候並不多。</p>
<p>皇室貴族的墳墓當然大不相同了。芝公園裏的儂川家廟，就司代表一切。德川幕府曾代理朝政，後來交還日皇，放至今後代仍封公麝。日人的景仰德川和日皇相同。家廟很大，依山而築，分爲三層。完全是古代中國的建築，大約和我國明代建築相近。</p>
<p>最外面的是唐門，滿刻立體的花卉山水。門內有橫廊，木頭圍牆，也有精細的彫刻，和我國園林中的縷花短牆一樣。對直有廳建拜殿，雖不高大，但命漆輝煌，奢華已極。再裏面過了通路，便是藏肖像的饗殿。髹金的神龕，古色古香的供物，佈置如我國的神廟祠堂。殿的後面，石級頂上，便是納骨石塔，和普通相像，並不十分講究了。這種宮殿，共有六七座，供奉着德川的子孫。</p>
<p>殿外空地上，有鐘樓和盥洗堂，左右對峙。石燈銅燈，羅列兩旁，總計在一千以上。都有龍鳳彫刻，工程很大。高而斜的屋頂，舖着綠色銅瓦。門戶揀梁，都是龍鳳雲頭的浮放刻。梅蘭竹菊，山石瀑布宛如中國圖畫。其他像盤記的木柱，硃紅漆上，描着全色的圖案，獅子美女的壁畫。無一不和我國故宮建築相近。美麗衣裳，恐日墓陵墓，亦不過如此了。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>淵奧和新奇</h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>六月六日的自由談上無　先生寫了一篇呌做「腐與濫」的文章，反對做文章的人使用陳腐的濫調。這種意見雖不算新，卻是很好的。但在同一的論旨之下，他又猛烈地攻擊「從定句上去用功夫」，攻擊「刻意為文」，攻擊「不肯走平凡的路」，攻擊「淵奧」和「新奇」，可就真有點古怪了。</p>
<p>普通文章裏面所表現的陳腐的濫調至少有兩種，首先是思想上的腐濫，其次才是文字上的腐濫。讓我們想想吧：假使文章裏面沒有一點值得貢獻給讀者的思想，而只是一輩子用一百個字就儘夠做文章這種長處，「淺顯」是的了，「平凡」是的了，「新鮮」倒也滿「新鮮」了，可是，他給人類幫過一點什麼忙沒有呢？至於文字上的腐濫也有兩種：見於今文的自然是「顫動的心弦」，「巡禮」，「風景線」，和「眼簾」，見於古文的卻是「不僅此也」，「掇拾」，「荊釵布裙」，「別具風致」，「劍拔弩張」等等；而「機構」，「建築」，「矛盾」，「動向」，這一類的術語都有牠各自的科學的涵義。永遠不會腐濫的。</p>
<p>我反對高雅主義，因為牠是虛偽的，離開現實的；但我也反對庸俗主義，因為牠是卑怯的，常常絆住現實底腳步。做成這種庸俗的骨幹的，是「泛泛主義」。從好久好久以來，泛泛主義就和中國人底老毛病連結在一起了。說著不著邊際的飄飄浮浮的話，對什麼事物都只是摸摸表皮就以為已經懂得，做起文章來沒有一點真實的描寫或確切的論斷，永遠過著幽默，滑稽，和輕薄的調笑的生活，將嚴肅的事情化為插科打諢，又把正經呌做傻，把艱難呌做笨，——這都是泛泛中義底精髓，對於這種人，滿頭大汗的日子是一天也沒有的，即使有，也要把牠改成「氣不稍喘，面不改容」。總之，每個人都像前清的官員一樣，把天大的事說得「輕而易舉」，而結果是不去舉牠。</p>
<p>沒有獨特的見解寫不出一篇論文，沒有獨特的觀察也寫不出一篇創作。這獨特，因為讀者沒有想到過，所以是淵奧的；因為讀者沒有看見過，所以又是新奇的。當一個作者要表現他自己所抓住的獨特的，有真實價值的東西的時候，他不得不在一字一句上用功夫，刻意要把牠表現得歸恰當，最精確，最有力，而不肯乖巧偷懶，嗎嗎呼呼地使牠在平凡與衰弱的敷衍之下受到糟蹋。我們度作者是不應該被嘲笑的，應該被嘲笑的卻反而是嘲笑者自己。</p>
<p>不知道藝術的底真實，不要求主題底深化，不看到現實底複雜綜錯，也就永遠沒有一篇好的作品。——還說什麼偉大？</p>
<p>據我所看見的，一切陳腐的濫調大概都包藏在油腔滑調的平凡文章裏，由庸俗的，專門迎合讀者底短處的，泛泛主義的作家們新手寫出來，這種作家常常給讀者「一點平易趣味」，使他們舒舒服服，不感一點困難，同樣也「一無所得」。如果要找例子，請大家留心看看報紙上面的長篇連載小說吧。</p>
<p>無礙先生在文章裏只是說明一個語言無教養而頭腦又簡單的中國人，在運用名詞，動詞，副詞，和各種子句的時候，所碰到的困難和笑話罷了，和「腐與濫」不生關係。</p>
<p>如果不願我們底文化永遠停留在兒戲和幼稚的階段，讓我們希望每一個作家都達到淵奧和新奇的境界吧，我們做平凡的讀者已經做夠了。</p>
<h3>車箱裏</h3>
<p>— 姚慕</p>
<p>—凡塵小札之二—</p>
<p>朋友，</p>
<p>第一封信想已收到了吧？「是夢話還是瘋話」？朋友，你大概會這樣想吧？可是你要明白，新從噩夢下醒過來的人，所呢喃的至少也是和藝語很近呢！</p>
<p>我現在很舒服的坐在一等車中了。我還是自由自在的我—自由自在，像因唐僧給妖精吃了暫時散了伙而回轉水簾洞的孫猴兒一樣。惺忪的眼睛已揉過幾回，我可以揀一些道上所見所聞的真情實事告訴你聽了。</p>
<p>沈酣地睡了一宿之後，沿路的景物已換上了北國的風味。—廣漢乾燥的平原，吹著黃土的熱風，殘缺不完東傾西歪的　房子，魁梧，黧黑，祼著上身的田中農夫。這路我本已走過幾趟，這回更感到枯燥單調。南方的豐長的綠草，池塘或小溪的柔媚的波光，這兒固然都看不到，而且大旱的圖畫已豁然呈霹在人們的眼前。有些麥子已經是變黃結實了，矮矮還不到一尺；更壞的，淡淡微黃瘦弱到像秋天的垂枯的小草一樣。可是桔桿的聲音，水車亭的影子，都希罕得很。北國的早比南方的似又更徹底了。</p>
<p>車到了泰安，我的包房添了一個旅客，一個六十多歲的老頭兒。深紫棠色的面孔的怒茁的白鬍子和矍鑠的眼睛，刻著三條深的皺紋的壽星似的腦袋，特別對我有吸引力。往好的地方想，我覺得他是宋元畫中的古色古香的人物；往壞的地方想，我看見土頭土腦的土財主的典型是在我的面前。他一進來向茶房拱手，向查票的拱手，向我恭恭敬敬的拱手，我不得不跟他招呼了，循例通了姓名之後，我瞥見他的帶有污泥的粗皺的手—我想起一種談話的資料來。</p>
<p>「老先生，這兒恐怕沒有下雨很久吧」？</p>
<p>「您瞧沿路的麥子，就可知道了」。他鼓著他的白鬍子，扇著手裏的石印字畫的紙扇，神采奕奕操著買賣人調兒說下去：「今年春天來就沒有幾點雨水，這一月來老是颳風。挖井嗎？挖到好幾丈還不見水的影子，鄉下人要跑幾十里路才挑到一桶水回來。……南方也短雨嗎？」他轉問我。</p>
<p>「聽說江蘇湖北也鬧旱呢」。</p>
<p>「哦，這就糟了，往年我到信陽州去過，那兒的麥子也有半個人那樣高，綠油油得可愛，不愁短了雨水哩。我們真不知觸犯了老天爺甚麼了！而且，春天刮大風，五六月必然大水，我活過了六十歲，經騐過不少，你等著！瞧吧」。</p>
<p>他的話雖然有點「貓哭老鼠」的意味，但他的預言，我相信，倒會不幸而言中的。</p>
<p>車過了濟南，我車廂的同伴換了一個中年人，雖然同樣是鄉下的財主，但卻屬于另一個典型。他穿著一套藍綢的便衣，長長的身材，比一般北方人的尺寸還大一點：但是他現在有的只是張著一層皮的粗大的骨格，沒有甚麼筋肉。額角和兩顴積　得很和膚皮卻現出晦黃，像動物園裏餓壞的巨獸那樣。他一上車後，老吸著紙煙，間中淡淡的跟我搭訕幾句。</p>
<p>當午飯後，我躺在鋪上閉著眼準備午睡的當兒，我的同伴把包房的門關上，我張開眼瞥見他從他的衣包裏拿出一件東西出來，我諦視一下，原來是一管注射針。我好奇的心動了，把眼睛半閉著偷偷的看他究竟幹些甚麼。他像醫生那樣把注射針用棉花揩了幾下，便轉身背著我，將高他的褲口，向小腿作注射的姿勢。把腿揉了一下之後，把那注射針略為拂拭，便藏回他的衣包裏。</p>
<p>「這就是所謂打嗎啡針那一回事吧」？這回我開了眼界了；怪不得這巨人只剩下皮包骨的一個空殼。」我這樣子想，但還有點半信半疑，後來我仔細的留神看他，由他的臂上和腿上的好些隱約可見的黑點，證明我的猜想是對了的。</p>
<p>朋友上次告訴你的誠然只是一些鎖事，然對於離去故國多年的你，總還有點意味吧？快要到站了，下回再說吧！</p>
<h3>每當我從回來底時候</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>黃昏降臨了，當工廠的笛聲彷彿魔鬼一般的哀鳴的時候，從陰森而充塞著油味苦悶底工場裏，我被解放出來了。整天過度工作的疲倦，這時我才享有呼吸一口新鮮空氣的權利，在自由的蒼穹之下，我伸展著四肢，深深地吁口長氣，蹣跚地回到我的家來了。</p>
<p>到家時，父親仍舊和昨日一樣，蹲在坡了腳的板凳上，皺著濃密的眉頭，用那隱痛的憂鬱底眼色，懶懶地向我投了一下，這彷彿向我招呼似的，也是向我表示著父親某種的要求啊。我，這時帶了這疲憊而哀痛的心，向他默默地點了一下腦袋，於是一徑往屋角去了。我是固意這樣的，其實我就不敢挨近父親的跟前，因為父親一看見我在他的身邊，他便向我說了大堆叨叨嘮嘮的話，這些話都使我難受得很。特別當父親向我拿錢買酒喝而我卻沒有個銅板給他的時候，父親立刻就板起嚴峻的面孔，很很地大罵我一頓。父親的這種脾氣我是曉得的，自從他失業之後，就喜歡喝酒，性情根本也變了，現在他整天不是在街上浪蕩，便　在家裏發瘟，因此就常常和我們為難。但對於父親這種可悲的行動的形成，我們是會體味到他內心的創痛的。所以我們不但沒有討厭他，或是有憎恨他那種惡劣底念頭。</p>
<p>在晚上，當我們一家大小都睡靜了的時候，父親纔悄悄地一個子起來，他老是睡不著——自從失業那時起，在黑壓壓的深夜裏，他好像貓子般的摸索著。把東西弄得七亂八落，唏咧嘩啦地震天響，我們就給驚醒過來了。母親往往因此和父親繞嘴，她很苦惱，很傷心，因為母親是和父親都是上了年紀的人，并且她和我一樣的：白天要拚命的操勞，晚上就想要好好地休息才行；不然我們就給生活踢開去的。可是，每每當我們夢入睡鄉的時候，父親的肚子也就忍受不住飢餓襲擊的時候了。失業之後，不曉怎的？父親的肚子好像寬了，食慾也強了。總之，對於父親這種不得已底擾人的舉動，我們除了感覺凄涼之外，還有什麼其他的話好說哩？你要曉得：我們是生活在窮困裏的人，一天除了兩頓僅可充飽的粗飯之外，簡直沒有一點什麼可口的東西到嘴的，所以，父親之所以那樣，就並非無因了。</p>
<p>在從前，當他有著工作的時候，父親就和現在兩樣。一早起來，他會把家裏的什物收拾得整整齊齊，樣樣弄得妥妥貼貼之後，父親才從容地上工去。在廠裏，他很「規矩」，工作又勤。所以曾經得過監工稱讚的。在晚上，當他回來的時候，衹要身邊有錢，父親必定買些花生之類的給弟妹吃，有時還能耐性的講些笑話及從別人聽來的奇奇怪怪的新聞給他們聽。總之，那時，父親是個性情溫和的人，生活極有紀律，顯然是個快樂而謹慎的人，所以在那時，衹要大家聚在一起，我們就談談笑笑，日子過得好像非常幸福似的。</p>
<p>可是，這種歡樂彷彿與我們沒有什麼緣份，它迅速地就離開我們而遠去了。我感覺：衹有憂鬱和苦惱，才是我們窮人真正侶伴哩。他時刻地緊隨著我們，彷彿我們的靈魂在我們的身上似的。</p>
<p>算起來，自父親因為衰老而被解雇到現在，足足有三年多了。時光無聊地一分一分的過去，一天一天的過去，一月一月的過去，一年一年的過去，而父親仍舊那樣空閒著兩手，整日整夜地過著一種痛苦的生活，這艱難而沉長的歲月，我們不曉將它如何為父親消磨才好。</p>
<p>不久，母親也遭同樣的不幸了。如此，我們的一家更陷於悲慘和窮困之中。每每當我從廠裏回來的時候，一種人間的創痛就襲擊著我的心頭。父親與母親常常因為喫飯以吵嘴，打架，看見這種不幸的生涯，我真沒心於生活了。這日子，我們不知如何將它結束了好？對於日日迫近我們眼前的災禍，對於這種好像永無止境的壓迫，對於我們生活在如此環境裏的人們，我深深地覺得好像被利刃插進肉裏而沒有把它拔出的那種楚痛。</p>
<p>父親比從前顯然衰老得多了，體魄也非常之傴僂，一種灰色的死亡，已經罩上他那蒼白而憔悴的面龐上。母親呢，也因為受父親的氣而生病，嘔血。他那艱苦的咳嗽，她那斷斷續續的語聲，她那陰鬱而充溢著不幸的容顏，她那不可避免的死底陰影啊……我的心簡直破碎了，每每當我從廠裏回來底時候。</p>
<h3>路燈</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>夜，逼榨出墨瀋的黑氣，</p>
<p>週遭的陰沉，</p>
<p>像浸在冰窖裏。</p>
<p>西北吹來了絲絲寒風，</p>
<p>你，覺得心悸麼？</p>
<p>背後似貼了一個魔影，</p>
<p>緊緊又緊緊；</p>
<p>驟步打不走膽寒，</p>
<p>心像要從嘴角裏跳出了。</p>
<p>天上沒有圓的和眉的，</p>
<p>佔住的是那些瞬動著小眼的東西，</p>
<p>那東西在笑你的卑鄙，</p>
<p>你，滾入了恐怖的樊籠，</p>
<p>聽不到它的聲息，</p>
<p>衹埋怨這崎嶇的小徑！</p>
<p>行行重行行，</p>
<p>魔影永不離你的背脊，</p>
<p>小的眼睛仍在笑，</p>
<p>你怒惱了，縣空了兩腳—奔！</p>
<p>鑽出黑暗的小徑，</p>
<p>向右的路角撒開了一點光亮，</p>
<p>呀！這該慶幸了？</p>
<p>且張大了兩顆疲眼，</p>
<p>放縱地掃射吧：</p>
<p>光亮閃死了魔影，</p>
<p>去了小眼兒的笑，</p>
<p>更捶死了你的恐怖，</p>
<p>朋友，你該怎樣的慶幸？</p>
<h3>大學時代（二）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>弗裡茨和我，我們二人立刻同意邀請雷娜麗，渡力嘉來做第八個女舞伴。我們當然遭遇了一些困難：因為當我們把我們的建議拿出來時候，那些小姑娘們和高貴小姐們都裝出正經面孔默不作聲了。但市長愛子畢竟有本事，把市長夫人拉到我們這一邊來；在這位明白整理的太太底爽快而果決的性格前面，那些姑娘們底皺眉和她母親底明顯反對—這是更厲害的—都無能為力了。</p>
<p>我們於是就在一天下午向著法國裁縫屋子走去。—我時常很惋惜我同那做我家生意的細木工底兒子絕交了，他的姊妹就幾乎天天同小波力嘉姑娘來往：我也很想把這交情恢復轉來，并且到他父親作坊裏學習細木工藝去；因為克里斯多夫究竟還是一個有自尊心的青年，頭腦也不簡單，不過他特別仇恨中學學生，他用一種厭惡的口氣稱他們為「拉丁人」；他時常邀集一班志向相同的朋友在體育場上同那些「拉丁人」不顧死活地毆鬥，無論鬥過多少次，這種戰爭還是不會終止的。</p>
<p>但現在我並不需要那種介紹手續：因為我們已經來至屋子前面，踏上秋風吹落的菩提樹黃葉，而走到低矮的屋門了。在門鈴響聲中，波力嘉太太從灶間出來接待我們；她把雙手在白圍裙上面揩乾之後，便請我們進到小住房裏去。</p>
<p>看不出這個一頭金黃色頭髮的矮胖女人卻會生出這樣一位柔婉可愛的黑髮姑娘。我們進來時候，這姑娘正放下工作站了起來，帶著一種半好奇半靦腆的感情倚靠在錢櫃上面。</p>
<p>當弗裡茨把我們的邀請說出來的時候，便有一朵紅雲現在她的臉上，我又看出她的眼睛發出光輝並且睜得很大；但當母親聽了不響，又現出深思樣子把頭搖動時候，她便輕輕閃到母親背後去，並從那似乎是通向臥房的門中走出去了。</p>
<p>我投了一眼在我們迎來時她坐在旁邊的那個桌子上面。在布片及其他小姑娘用物中間放著一雙拉土丁布製的鞋子，連邊緣都做好了，似乎她剛才正做著這件東西。這雙鞋子異常之小，我的幼年的幻想不禁連想起穿這鞋子的那雙小腳；我在腦子中似乎看見那雙小腳已經同我的雙足交叉著在跳舞了，我還想請求她再站一會兒，但那雙腳一下停著，一下動著，不斷地在作弄我。</p>
<p>當我的腦子中夢想這些幻影時候，波力嘉太太正開始問我的朋友—我當然推他去說話—互相辯駁，直至後來把市長夫人名字說出來了，這場爭論才逐漸傾向到有利於我們這一方面來。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>對靑年問題提出三個解决的辦法</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>生而爲今日這動盪時代的靑年，實在是很不幸的！靑年本來是樂觀的，有爲的，前進的。但現在却不然，現在的靑年，常給許多煩悶緊壓着，不免要感到生的艱困，呈着徨徬，懊悵，絕望！</p>
<p>現代靑年急待解决的問題很多，而以這三項爲最重要：學業，戀愛，職業。這三個切身的問題，不但使一般靑年陷於苦惱的境地，有時還要迫得靑年非自殺不可！前幾天的報紙，曾登載着一位靑年因要求家長允許繼續入校求學不遂，竟氣情服毒自殺的新聞。近日又發生一椿大學生因失戀投浦自盡的案件。這是關於學業和戀愛方面。至若因失業而犧牲生命的，更是層出不窮！</p>
<p>靑年問題是整個的社會問題，而非靑年的個人問題，這是很容易明白的。例如說失業問題，這從表面上看，好像是個人問題，實際却是一個社會問題。因爲目前一班靑年的找不到出路，社會不景氣是一個最大的原因。所以說靑年的失業問題，也是一個整個的社會問題。是故有人主張，靑年問題不能單獨解决。必須整個的社會問題解决，靑年問題也才能得到解决。這話是對的。</p>
<p>然而整個的社會問題解决，究竟是一件極難的事。至少在最近的將來，還沒法下手。那末，怎麽辦呢？暫時把靑年問題擱在一邊嗎？若果是這樣，我們就只有眼看着一般靑年，一個個走上險路！這無論如何是使不得的，在整個的社會問題未能得到解决之先，靑年問題，實有當爲個人問題解决的必要。這樣的解决，或許是不徹底的，但却是急切的！</p>
<p>單獨解决靑年問題有什麽方法呢？這可分爲三方面來說。</p>
<p>第一，先說學業問題。我們承認，學業之於靑年，這是十分切要的。但我們要明白，現在的我國敎育制度，是不能使每個靑年，都有平等求學的機會的。所以一位窮靑年，要希望能由小學升入中學，或由中學升進大學，實在很困難。但這是不要緊的。須知學問這東西，不一定須入學校才能求得到。克苦自學，亦可以達到求知的目的。世界有不少淵博的學問家，他們的知識，都非由學校敎育得來，而是自己苦學成功的。况我國現時的學校敎育，又是很靠不住的。一位靑年又何必以不能入校求學爲失望呢？</p>
<p>第二，就拿戀愛問題來講。靑年戀愛也是必要的。但現代靑年要談戀愛，千萬不可把戀愛看做是神聖的東西。須知目下是一個金錢的世界，什麼都商品化，愛情亦不能例外，窮小子要追求異性，是到處都會碰壁的。這點靑年應該覺悟。所以要戀愛，成功最好，失敗也無需喪氣。給這一個對方棄拒，再找另一個。我並非看戀愛如兒戲，實際非這樣不可。否則只好自殺，沒有第二條路可走！</p>
<p>第三，再說職業問題。一個靑年要生活，就必須有一種職業。但在這社會極度不景氣的時代，人浮於事，找職業是不容易的。故要解决職業問題，最好有職業者，須安於職業，不要見異思遷。沒有職業者，只要有事做，雖地位較低亦屈就。要緊的是選擇職業，不可抱過奢的希望。這是會失敗的。尤其是一部份受過相當敎育的知識靑年，切不應自視太高，以特殊階級自居。職業是沒有高下的，有益於人羣者，什麽都可幹！萬一失業，亦不可灰心。只要不存非分之想，工作一定是不會拒絕你的。</p>
<p>總之，一位現代靑年，要希望解脫自身的苦悶，對於我們所處的時代環境，應認識清楚。我們要認識在現在這個社會裏我們不當給環境無配，我們應去克服環境。我們必須振起自己力量，來彌補社會所有的缺陷。因為一個社會的進步，是要靠靑年去推進的！</p>

<h3>燈（下）</h3>
<p>— 譚曇</p>
<p>上篇我約略的寫出一點我和燈的雜事。下邊我將更寫出一點關於燈的知識。</p>
<p>古時，大概只有火而沒有燈燈，尙書上所謂「柴」不必說？就是劉向校書天錄（？）藜火陵雲，也只是火而不是燈。史記陳勝胡廣傳、「籌火狐嗚」、「籌火」雖則後人也稱爲「籌燈」但牠只是後來的燈籠之類、我不知道臘燭和奮燈那一樣早，卽以「燃腹爲燈」做例子罷，我就不知過他們的「燈」，到底是不是先知道油可以點燈。後來看見死者胖不過，肚裏一定很多油，所以當他燈點？</p>
<p>依情理論之，那末膏燈因在臘燭之前；因爲臘燭的完成明明知道了油可以點燈，而再把他凝聚，做成臘燭。但是翻開古書，却明明說燭的地方多於說燈，並且早於說燈。假使說燈是比較貴族，而用的人少一些吧，那末孤燈靑燈，明明都是很寒酸的，而紅燭華燭又多麼富麗？</p>
<p>詩經「庭燎始光」，燎是用炭的，還不是用油。漢武帝夜看李夫人的鬼魂，不知是在燈光下，還是在燭光下？</p>
<p>李商隱詩，「珠泊飄燈獨自歸」，我就不知道是用臘燭的，還用有油，意者拿着走的東西，還是像後來的燈籠和紗燈一樣用臘燭的居多。「何當共剪西窗燭」！「臘炬成灰淚始乾」，唐時候大概以臘燭較爲普遍。而日暮漢宮傳臘燭」，「畫短苦夜長，何必秉燭游」，號末，東漢時候，無疑已經用臘燭的了。</p>
<p>佛寺有燈日長明燈，是用油的，佛在東漢時傳入中國，我不知道長明燈，是什麽時候點起的。是不是印度傳來卽有？</p>
<p>燈和燭，大概是混用的。卽是用燭，只要在燭上加一層罩，或什麽的，人們也有呌他燈了。好像紗燈，燈籠，都一樣不用臘燭，而不礙其呌燈。</p>
<p>在往昔大平盛世，常常在元宵晚上，大放花燈，表示歌舞昇平的思意，特別是江南人民習於工巧，所以，吳越諸地的春燈工細異常，明末福王偏據江南，那時淸兵已經迫近金陵城，而他老先生還是閑情逸致，在南京城大賞春燈。「聞說滿城飛砲火，深宮又自賞春燈」，這件事永遠爲歷史家所嘆息。其實在歷史上有了這一段燈的故事，燈的身價，立刻重了不少。雖則他的功勞和力量，有些地方和太陽完全一樣。</p>
<p>自然，近代都市更是非燈不可。假使上海沒有燈，就沒有上海之夜，沒有上海之夜，也就沒有了上海。</p>
<p>物質文明的憎惡者，討厭一切新的東西，其實這只是說明了他們的淺陋，卽以燈論，年虹燈美麗的顏色，使都市美化起來，我們且不說，就是普通的電燈只要四邊加上一層美麗的流蘇罩，他立刻會把你從現實的世界引起飄渺的夢境的。「燈下萬人」，牠更助人嬌艷呢？</p>
<p>「月落鳥啼霜滿天，天楓漁火對愁眠」「潮落夜江斜月裏，兩三星火是瓜州」，自然，最會我魂牽夢繞的，不是都市的紅燈，不是盡堂的銀燭，而是一江空水中幾點漁燈。但我已經難開他們很久？</p>
<h3>園林</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>夏季，園林葱鬱稠茂，枝葉之間，都結起纍纍的果子了，時時逗誘着園外撑傘而過的行人的饞涎。風，帶着午陽的炎威掠過林蔭。不時從枝葉門散下數聲淸脆的烏聲：蟬兒像熬不住太陽的燒炙，躺在枝葉下儘在拉長嗓子喝。龍眼已將近甜熟了，小孩子們時時會覷空從園墻上爬進來偸摘，這當兒少不得人守在那兒看管：當看管人的就是祖父，每天晌午，在一塊綠蔭下，祖父手裏總是搖着一柄大蒲扇，躺在一張竹椅上，望着枝頤的果子，臉上浮起笑意：平拖在胸前的長鬚，不時隨着扇風在那兒悠然揚動。</p>
<p>園子裏總共有二十餘株龍眼和柚樹，都是祖父一手種起來的，還有一株荔枝，挾在一株龍眼與柚樹的中間，最爲祖父關愛。幾年辛勞的結果，那年的龍眼和柚樹開始結了不少果子，祖父心裏自然得意非常的了。那時我大約還是六歲光景。故鄉的六七兩月正是農忙之交，母親們日裏很少時間在家，只好和着姊姊跟在祖父跟前，祖父當然是疼愛孫兒的。生弁鄉裏的孩子本來擴野一些，姊姊雖然僅大我兩歲，已經學會了爬樹的本頭了。每每看着祖父在那兒打午睡的當兒，就借着捉蟬的口實，姊姊會爬樹上去摘些龍眼下來，姊第二人背着祖父分吃：還未十分甜熟的龍眼。吃來雖滿口澀味，也覺得甜津有味。但每次都會給祖父發覺，自然不免受一頓斥責。不過祖父對於我們總是疼愛有加，過後又任着我們鬧了。有次正當大雨過後，樹枝上滑溜溜的，我又慫恿姊姊上樹，不巧這次可肇了禍，姊姊跌了下來，滿口流血躺在地上。結果雖然意外得到一握龍眼，姊姊的兩個門牙可跌壞了。</p>
<p>到了七月初頭，龍眼大都次第甜熟了。這時祖父已不再來禁止我們，每天總採下一籃來隨時分些給我和姊姊吃。小孩子的慾望是不會滿足的，看着祖父不在意的時候，還是要去偸摘一下。因爲是初年結實，果量也有限，都丕凖備摘來賣去，儘留在樹上待姑母們回來。姑母們中最有趣的是婉美二姑，她倆凑在一塊時，總會鬧出許多玩笑話見。婉姑吃果子是有名的，不怕酸的澀的，熟了的或未熟的，都吃得津津有味。婉姑一來，雖然離甜熟期還很晚的柚子，都得打幾個下來。那時我們總切望姑母們回來，可以大吃特吃一番跟着姑母們鬧去。姊姊而且可以自吿奮勇爬樹，祖父看着也不來禁北了。祖父是不喜歡吃龍眼的，（似乎別的果子也不太吃）但當他看着我們圍在樹下亂吃起來的情景，他可樂得笑了。</p>
<p>那一年的園林，在我的童年生活中可算是最美麗可愛的了。</p>
<p>現在，祖父早已作了古人，墓碑且經變了褐色：自己的雙脚踏上了人生的大道，有形無形的荷負着一些爲人的責任了：姊姊呢，也作了兩個小孩子的母親：姑母們更變得快，婉美二姑固不必說，一向頗稱優裕的開姑的家，近年也衰落下去了。園林雖然依着，龍眼柚子雖然年年開花結子，只是當年快樂歡娛的美麗可愛的情境，可再不會重織在園林之中！</p>
<p>據說那株祖父特別關愛的荔枝，直到現在却從沒有結過一次果，我想祖父地下若果有知，聽計這個消息，也許是心裏一件不樂意的事罷？</p>
<p>唉，懷憶中的園林，昔時的歡娛的童年之夢，而今已去了，去了。</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>最近病了了一個多月。開始是頭痛，當然我　有視爲那是病的關端，吃了一服虎頭牌的頭痛粉，毫不在意地照常工作。第二天却發起燥來，太陽角上，像火一般地靈着，兩個手掌和脚底同樣火辣辣的，這當然是病的現象了，回家煎了一服午時茶，蒙被而臥。這是祖母每次作爲一件大事般的叮嚀我的，祇要晚上出一身大汗，病就霍然。當夜半夜裏醒來，一個身體果然像從水要拖起來似的，下一天早上又是照常工作，雖然人老是那末目暈頭眩，走路都有些飄飄然。那是黃霉時節，據說南人是重「濕」的，那時是濕毒的時候，每個人都有這種現象，其實病已正式進行了，三天之後，我的兩條腿再不能把自己的身體從床上支撑起來。</p>
<p>是病當得醫治，窮人的命有時侯或許較富人更貴重。由家人的扶助到附近的一家醫院去，醫生除知道我脈博比普通人增高之外，他說是這熱，給了幾色白色的藥粉，紙包上開明日服三次，飯後服等宇樣。這種施診恐怕已是最週至的了。</p>
<p>六包藥粉分二天吃完了，人像沒有服藥粉之前一樣。妻子私下爲我請了位醫生來，經過他嚴密的診察，論調是相同的，是流行性感冒，寫了一張藥方，吩咐靜心休養，代價是超出那醫院的掛號費二十倍以上，藥費不在內。</p>
<p>但是高貴的醫生或許不能醫治窮人的病的，他的藥力把我的病狀加重了。終天昏昏睡着，遍體被很高的熱度焦灸着，但是到掌燈的時分，彷彿一個普通人一樣地淸醒過來，那就到天明不能睡熱的。這情形延長了一星期，醫生調換了三位，我的病似乎成了絕症，我從他們屢屢搖頭的態度上分辨出來的。小時候我同樣患過這般的重症，我祇知道每天有一個陌生的醫生來騐我脈博，有時甚至二個三個，房要擁擠着鄰舍，親戚，對於他們的竊竊私議往往使我沒來由地發怒，母親是吊着淚，終天廝守在床畔，好像有人要奪去我的樣子。但是我什麼都是茫然的，淸醒來就想出許多要吃的東西，而且最好馬上辦到；甚至從來沒有上口的烟捲之類。這是探訪我的人都焦急起來，他們以爲是夢囈，一個十二三歲的孩心决想不出那末許多名目來的。但在他們輕輕討論着的時候，我已淸晰地聽到了，這種反常的聽覺也使他們疑懼的。後來我知道我的病延長了一年，懸牌的醫生沒有一個或多或少許的請到，終究沒有一個人能說出洽合的病症來的。這很和我的個性相同，我往往故意使人不瞭解我，卽使是我最知己的朋友。但是這一次生病使我痛改前非了，我希望有一個醫生立刻治好我的病，或者竟是一服相反的藥劑把我弄死了。因爲我已不是一個十二三歲的孩子，也沒有母親廝守着了，雖然妻子代替了母親的位子，不過那些從前我討厭他們竊竊私議的人們是一個都不見了，能够調換三個醫生，恐怕妻子已盡了最後的能力了。從前的世界和我母親的死亡同時埋滅了，在這一個多月的病中，使我學會了在現社會中做人的秘訣，雖然時刻希望着脫離病榻，然而能增加一點人生的經騐來始是壞事，這樣想着的時候，我的病在隨牠自然的因循中好了起來。</p>
<h3>妯娌　（上）</h3>
<p>— 凌秄錫</p>
<p>長根才死了不久，可是從斷七的時候起，他家裏三天兩天的吵嘴，打架；連左右　鄰居都由談論而討厭，由討厭而怨恨，到後來是，甚至於有點駭害了——時常那樣的從淸早起就鬥口，吵到成更半夜的；打着，駡着，哭喊着。又上吊投河尋死覓活地作鬧着。吵得人家六神不安地，而自己們呢，又祇顧鬥口鬥心思，爭取一點暗便宜與嘴上的「榮耀」。這樣、人家誰不恨，誰不指望安寗一點呢？</p>
<p>然而，長根家裏卻依然是「三日兩頭」地那麼鬧着。</p>
<p>於是，村上的人們也時常把長根家裏的兩個「吵精」做起評論的對象，與靑早黃昏的閑話的資料了。</p>
<p>「那麼怨家死對頭似地鬧，鬧到幾時才休呢？」</p>
<p>「休？你可一點兒也不明白！長根娘子過門的時候，鎭上的王道士便暗地對人說過的：長根的娘跟妹子都肖虎、而新娘子是屬羊的，羊入虎口，嫁過去是要吃苦的呢。」</p>
<p>「不錯啊！羊入虎口，命裏相尅的哪。你們還不知道呢。」</p>
<p>「可是我說，長根娘年紀也活了一大堆了。怎麽一點兒都不明白！姑子跟嫂子不相是常有的事，做婆的不勸和，倒反過來火上加油，合着女兒磨折孤孀媳婦，天天從大消早起，就怨天駡地的，這也是作興啊？」</p>
<p>「命裏相尅的咾——倒底女兒是自己人，親骨血呀，想想看，人家不帮自己人帮誰，不帮女兒倒帮孤孀媳婦嗎」？</p>

(12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Hebei issue this time, Chief He exerted great effort to negotiate with the Japanese side.

At 10:00 AM on the same day, under the command of Captain Adachi, more than 300 infantry soldiers will take a train directly from Qinhuangdao to Beiping. The original Japanese troops stationed in North China have had their orders to postpone their return to their home country cancelled due to the easing of the Hebei issue. The first batch is scheduled to leave Beiping and Tianjin on the 18th, taking the Beining train to Tanggu at 6:00 AM, and changing ships to return home. The second batch will gather in Qinhuangdao on the 20th to return home. The Japanese destroyers Fuji and Katsu No. 2, which are berthed at the Japanese concession pier, and the Japanese Haiguangsi Barracks have taken measures to communicate. The radio has been installed, and the sailors of the two ships paid homage to the shrine at 10:00 AM on the 12th, and paraded in full armor. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From 5:00 PM on the 11th, an important meeting was held at Umezu's official residence on Asahi Street in the Japanese concession, which lasted until 1:00 PM on the 12th. Those who participated were Doi Harada, Umezu, Colonel Kita, Lieutenant Colonel Ōkido, Iga, head of the special affairs agency, Takahashi, military attache stationed in Beiping, Sakai Takashi, chief of staff, Ōki, Dōwaki, and Ishii, the three chiefs of staff. The content was extremely secret. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At around 9:00 AM on the 12th, three Japanese planes flew from Jinzhou outside the pass, flying at low altitude along the Beining Railway line to reconnaissance the movement of the garrison troops in Tanggu, Junliangcheng, and Lutai. Then they flew to the Jinpu Railway line to reconnaissance to Machang and Jinghai, and finally came to Tianjin and landed at the Dongju airfield. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The three Japanese planes that arrived in Tianjin on the 12th, numbered 126, 128, and 22, formed a formation from 3:40 PM to 4:30 PM to circle over the Japanese concession, the East Station, and the Hedong area to welcome the arrival of the new replacement troops in North China. 300 members of the selected team of the 12th Division of Kurume, the new Japanese garrison in North China, took the Hong Hayamaru from Dagu at 11:00 AM on the 12th and arrived at Tanggu. They changed to two special trains on the Beining Road and arrived in Tianjin at 4:00 PM and 4:30 PM respectively. They gathered at the East Station, formed a team at 4:40 PM, and entered Haiguang Temple via Wanguo Bridge, the French Concession, the Japanese Concession, Kotobuki Street, Miyajima Street, Akashi Street, and Fukushima Street. At 10:00 AM on the 14th, another team of the replacement troops will arrive at Qinhuangdao by ship and land. This unit belongs to the selected members of the Asahiyama 7th Division of the Tokyo 1st Regiment. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The officers of the Japanese destroyers Fuji and Katsu were led by Egashira, the adjutant of the Japanese garrison, at 8:00 AM on the 12th to survey the terrain in the streets near the border between China and Japan. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) When the destroyers Katsu and Fuji came to Tianjin on the 11th and passed Wanguo Bridge, it was recognized that the bridge administrator closed the bridge abruptly when the Fuji warship passed the bridge without exceeding three meters, causing damage to the stern. On the 12th, Ikegami, the captain of the Japanese concession gendarmerie, was specially dispatched to the Haihe Engineering Bureau to protest. The foreign staff replied that the bridge closing had a fixed time and that this was not an intentional advancement, considering the protest to be unreasonable. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is said that before Doi Harada came to Tianjin this time, he had a meeting with Japanese Army Minister Hayashi Jirō, Chief of Staff Nishizaki Kazuo, and Military Affairs Bureau Chief Nagami in Changchun to discuss the Hebei issue. It is said that two countermeasures have been decided: 1. To concretize the various demands previously made by Japan to China. 2. The future attitude of the Japanese garrison and the Kwantung Army in China should be based on the above two countermeasures. In general, people speculate that the meeting in Tianjin this time must also be based on these two principles for discussion. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese military attache Amemiya visited Tang Youren, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:30 PM on the 12th to hear the Chinese side's attitude after the Hebei issue. The meeting lasted for about an hour. Then, Deputy Minister Tang went to the Railway Official Residence to visit Wang Jingwei and reported the meeting. (12th Dentsu News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japan has again put forward very important demands to the Chinese authorities, so the situation in North China is extremely tense. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Doi Harada told foreign reporters today that the Japanese side has not made any demands for areas similar to non-garrison areas. He is optimistic about the peaceful resolution of the current dispute. The Japanese soldiers currently stationed in Tianjin will withdraw within two or three days after the replacement troops arrive. This move can be regarded as a sign that the tense situation has now passed. Doi Harada's stay in Tianjin is indefinite and he will go to Beiping within a few days to discuss everything with the Chinese authorities. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, the first batch of replacement troops lined up from the East Railway Station and entered the camp. The Japanese expatriates in Tianjin welcomed them warmly. Japanese people were cheering for the new soldiers all along the streets of the Japanese concession. The commander of the Japanese army in North China and the consul in Tianjin were all at the station to welcome them. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At around 5:00 PM on the 12th, one of the three Japanese planes that came to Tianjin carried Lieutenant Colonel Ōkido and flew to Chengde. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Iga, the head of the Japanese Special Affairs Agency in Yuguang, will return to his original post as regimental commander after his term expires at the end of August. Lieutenant Colonel Yoshioka, an attache of the Kwantung Army, has been internally appointed to succeed him as the head of the Special Affairs Agency. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming visited He this afternoon to receive instructions and report. It is scheduled to return to Tangshan tonight and will go to Qinhuangdao, Yuguan, and other places for inspection the day after tomorrow. It is said that Tao will come to Beiping again within a few days regarding the special police assistance payment to make concrete consultations with relevant parties. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Decun came to Beiping on the orders of Song Zheyuan to report on the military and political situation in the Chahar Province. He arrived in Beiping tonight and is scheduled to visit He tomorrow morning. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Decun left Zhangjiakou for Beiping this morning because Chahar affairs required contact in Beiping. It is scheduled to arrive in Beiping tonight. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Decun and Bao Yueqing arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou at 6:30 PM on the 12th. Qin said that he came for private matters and will return to Chahar within a few days. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Deshen said that a Japanese Kwantung Army tour group of four people in Zhangbei, one was an official of the Duolun Special Affairs Agency, and the other three were employees of Mitsubishi Corporation. They arrived in Zhangbei from Duolun on the 6th. The garrison in the area telegraphed the provincial government for instructions because they saw that they had no passports. After the provincial government telegraphed to release them, the group came to Zhangjiakou and telegraphed to the Kwantung Army, saying that we had detained them, causing a misunderstanding on the Japanese side. The Japanese puppet troops who were practicing in the Daliangdi area have retreated slightly, but there is no sign of withdrawal. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Organization of the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters; Shang Zhen Prepares an Outline</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The organization of the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters is extremely simple. The central government ordered Shang Zhen to prepare an outline. Shang will stipulate the establishment of a General Affairs Section, a Staff Section, and a Military Affairs Section. Yang Xiaocang is internally designated as the chief of staff. A Secretariat is also established, with Liu Lianfang appointed as the director. All personnel of the Staff Section are transferred from the Military Sub-Committee. Huang Guanghua's unit of Shang Zhen will start the transfer of Qinghe within a few days. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shang Zhen's representative, Li Hongwen, visited the President of the Executive Yuan at 2:30 PM to make a report and receive instructions. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Comments on the Hebei Incident</h3>
<p>(Paris) The increasingly serious Sino-Japanese problem has aroused heated discussion in Parisian newspapers. Le Matin stated that Japanese pressure is expanding southward. It is unknown where it will end. The weakness of the League of Nations has opened the floodgates, causing the Japanese tide to impact the entire Far East. Le Temps stated that the rise of Japanese warlords is already very obvious. The United Kingdom and the United States therefore feel extremely uneasy. The slogan "Asia is for Asians" called for by the Japanese should actually be "Asia is for the Japanese." The newspaper finally stated, how will the powers maintain the integrity of North China and the open door policy? (11th National Electric)</p>
<p>(Paris) The right-wing newspaper "L'Ordre" commented on the Chinese situation, saying, "The United Kingdom and the United States are now both panicked. What the United States has already decided is to refuse to recognize 'Manchukuo' and act in unison with the United Kingdom. In short, there is absolutely no intention to intervene. As for the United Kingdom, its attitude is also the same, but it has decided to send the economic and financial expert Sir Ross to China as a sign of sympathy. In this way, the goals held by Japan will not be difficult to achieve one by one, but it is still unknown how broad the scope of its planned strategy will be." (12th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Various Foreign Legations in Beiping are Now Considering Moving South</h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Morning Post claimed today that people in London are now closely watching the development in North China, believing that the first priority is that British people do not harbor any illusions about the will of the Japanese. It is said that the move of various foreign legations in Beiping to Nanjing is now under consideration. The commercial interests of the United Kingdom in North China are not currently threatened, but the treatment of foreign companies in "Manchukuo" makes it impossible to be optimistic. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to well-informed sources, the US embassy in China will soon move to Nanjing. The US announced on May 17 that the diplomatic envoy to China would be promoted to ambassador. This move can only be implemented after Congress approves it. The embassy's move south is not far from the promotion. It is said that it is due to the recent evolution of the situation in China. Japan may ask the US to withdraw its troops stationed in North China. The US is deeply afraid of falling into a difficult position and would rather move the embassy south and recall the infantry regiment stationed in Tianjin to the country and transfer the battalion of marines protecting the embassy to Nanjing to avoid difficulties. In addition, after the Chinese government moved its capital to Nanjing, the embassy should not be re-established in Beiping. Moreover, the US minister travels frequently between Beiping and Nanjing for official business, which is both arduous, and the Nanjing consulate's buildings are not sufficient. Land has now been purchased for the construction of a new building. (11th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Customs Commissioner Replies to Japanese Consul's Protest</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Regarding the Japanese consul's protest against the case of the customs ship inspecting Japanese fishing boats, the customs commissioner replied: 1. The special vessel inspected Baosheng Maru, 20 nautical miles from Tamsui. The Fusheng ship inspected Wulai Maru at Niudao. Neither was in Japanese territorial waters. At the time, the two Japanese fishing boats did not have the Japanese flag, so there was no way to identify them. 2. The special vessel bought six fish from Baosheng, giving two yuan. Baosheng did not refuse to sell and accepted it. It cannot be said that it was a forced purchase or sale. As for the case of the Japanese warship opening fire in our territorial waters to threaten the special vessel being inspected, the customs commissioner has, in addition to verbally protesting to the Japanese consul, reported to the customs office and the Ministry of Finance for investigation and decision. No further reply has been given to the Japanese consul. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Political Conference</h3>

Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Kong Xiangxi, Lin Sen, Tang Niuzhi, Tang Youren, and more than 20 other people attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Many important cases were discussed until the meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch) At the Central Political Conference on the 12th, President Wang gave a detailed report on the handling of the Hebei issue. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Arrives in Nanjing to Visit President Wang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 12th. At 6:00 PM, he visited Tang Youren at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After a brief talk, he followed Tang to visit President Wang to report everything. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Address of the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters is Taken Over by the High Court</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters ended, all archives and equipment have been moved out one after another. The address of the headquarters will be taken over by the Hebei Higher Court, and personnel will be sent to guard it within a few days. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Municipal Party Headquarters was completely closed by the 12th. The documents and furniture were sealed for transportation. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Preventing Suicide and Reforming Psychology</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Mr. Wu, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, expressed his views on the issue of suicide prevention. He advocated addressing the problem from two aspects: reforming psychology and providing practical assistance. This is indeed a profound argument. Here, I will further elaborate on the aspect of reforming psychology.</p>
<p>Based on general observation, the formation of suicidal thoughts is often due to economic difficulties or romantic failures. However, sociologists and psychologists have consistently argued that the causes of suicide are not as simple as commonly believed. Regarding economic difficulties, at least eight or nine out of ten people in society face such challenges. Yet, those who resort to suicide are actually a tiny fraction. Furthermore, the hardships of life in primitive societies are vastly greater than those in advanced societies. However, suicide is almost nonexistent in primitive societies. This shows that mere economic difficulties are by no means the absolute cause of suicide. As for romantic failures, they are not uncommon in modern society. However, the majority can endure such setbacks. Thus, while economic difficulties and romantic failures can drive people to suicide, it is only when they cannot endure such ordeals and are unable to relieve their mental suffering that they resort to this last resort. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>According to the research of the French sociologist Émile Durkheim, the cause of suicide lies in the development of egocentric ideas. Psychoanalysts, on the other hand, often attribute it to the suppression of self-desires (including sexual desire and the desire for power), which leads people to mental abnormality, disappointment, pessimism, resentment, and even suicide. Based on these two theories, the cause of suicidal thoughts can be understood. In primitive societies, the collective consciousness is higher than individual self-awareness, and egocentric ideas are not developed. Therefore, things that civilized people consider humiliating, painful, or disappointing are often nonexistent for primitive people. This is why suicide is rare in primitive societies. In modern society, the poor and impoverished masses do not have strong self-desires. Apart from food and sex, they have few other extravagant desires, and their demands for things like fame, glory, power, and status are not profound. This being the case, suicide is mostly committed by those who have experienced business failures, sudden bankruptcy, or the decline of their family fortunes, while those who have always lived in poverty are rarely seen to commit suicide. Even considering the recent case of a family suicide in Shanghai, the suicide victim, Zhang Yuexin, was originally a wealthy landowner, and Yue Lin used to earn 150 yuan a month and owned considerable property in Tianjin. It can be seen that the cause of suicide in this case was not a lack of means to survive, but rather an excessive disappointment and resentment towards the world, and an excessive indignation towards their own experiences, which led them to believe that suicide was the only way to relieve their suffering. In essence, the cause of suicide lies in excessive individualism, excessive vanity, and an overly developed concept of suicide. Furthermore, judging from Yue Lin's confession, he was often unwilling to borrow or ask favors of relatives and friends, which shows his strong vanity and ego. With such a personality in such adverse circumstances, he was bound to become mentally disturbed due to excessive stimulation, and because of his mental disturbance, he was unable to adapt to society, eventually leading to suicide as his only recourse.</p>
<p>Conversely, those who can abandon their egocentric ideas and replace them with "social consciousness," "national consciousness," or even focus entirely on the well-being of humanity will persevere despite hardships and difficulties and go all out. Looking at revolutionaries in thought, politics, and systems throughout history, both in China and abroad, their fates were almost always arduous and admirable. However, few are heard of becoming frustrated and committing suicide. This is because the psychology of revolutionaries is completely different from that of suicide victims. Revolutionaries do not aim for their personal happiness but focus on the happiness of society, the nation, or even all of humanity. In other words, they have a special mission, and as long as the mission is not accomplished, they cannot die. Furthermore, consider Gandhi, who fought for justice for the lower classes. He could fast for dozens of days, completely disregarding his personal well-being. Consider how difficult it is to undergo long-term fasting compared to committing suicide at once. It is quite obvious. However, Gandhi has repeatedly fasted but never contemplated suicide. This is not because he cherishes his life, but because he wants to preserve this body to create well-being for society and humanity. Therefore, if a person can truly not be centered on the individual but on society, the nation, or humanity, then no matter how difficult life is, they will not lightly give up their life.</p>
<p>This principle can also be applied to those who have experienced romantic failures. Those who focus solely on their own happiness often become extremely frustrated after a breakup, eventually leading to suicide. However, those who consider the hard work and cultivation of their parents and consider their responsibility to society, the nation, and humanity will not kill themselves because of a breakup. Therefore, regardless of economic suicide or romantic suicide, the cause lies in being centered on the self. If one can expand this and aim for the welfare of humanity, then one can emulate Mozi's self-denial and Christ's uncomplaining acceptance of persecution, revolutionaries who live in prisons, or Gandhi who repeatedly fasts without losing his life.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that psychological reformation is indeed necessary for preventing suicide. So, how can psychology be reformed? Specifically, in the negative aspect, it means restraining material desires and eliminating vanity. In the positive aspect, it means promoting a spirit of great fearlessness and replacing narrow egocentric ideas with universal love.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Legislator Wu Shangying previously went to the Northwest with Sun Ke to conduct an inspection. He has gained a great deal of information on the Northwest land issue through extensive visits and consultations. He initially stated that owner-farmers account for more than 50% in the Northwest, with the remainder being semi-owner-farmers. Tenant farmers are extremely rare, which is not far from the principle of "land to the tiller." The main agricultural products in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces are cotton, wheat, tobacco leaves, and food. Currently, cotton production has declined, and food is in short supply. Flour is transported from Tongguan by people, which needs to be resolved by developing water conservancy and transportation, cultivating land, and providing loans to farmers.

Before the special tax is reformed, local tobacco transported from Fujian should still be handled in accordance with the regulations. The so-called order for the province to stop re-taxation should not be discussed. (12th Press)</p>

<h3>Reviving China's Economy, Japan Opposes International Cooperation, Plans to Hold Meeting in Nanjing in September, British Representative Asks Japan to Proceed Jointly, Shigemitsu Expresses Determination to Act Alone</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The British government has decided to send Rothschild as an economic advisor to the British Ambassador to China to investigate the issue of economic assistance to China. Clive, the British Envoy to Japan, was ordered by his government to visit Vice Minister Shigemitsu on the 8th to inform him of this matter and to request the Japanese government to cooperate with other countries in conducting a survey to restore the foundation of China's economy. Shigemitsu replied that Japan had no intention of holding a meeting with other countries to study the issue of China's economic recovery. According to a telegram from Paris, Britain and the United States intend to have Japan hold an international conference in Nanjing in September. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' view on this issue is as follows: An international conference attempting to revive China's economy proves that the countries' understanding of the Far East is the same as in the past. Under no circumstances is Japan willing to discuss China's economic problems with other countries. The direct cause of China's economic difficulties is the US silver policy. Under the control of the US President, this policy cannot reduce China's economic difficulties through international conferences. Japan has reason to oppose the international economic conference in Nanjing. Japan has already decided to assist China's economy independently, and various specific matters are underway, so there is no need to hold an international conference to discuss this issue. (United News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) When Britain recently proposed convening a Chinese currency conference in Nanjing, the Japanese government refused to send representatives to participate. According to London sources, Japan's refusal to send representatives was a sign of opposition to convening a currency conference. The relevant countries have finally decided to send financial representatives to China to assist the ambassadors of the countries in investigating China's currency situation. In this way, the Japanese government should not object to it, and it is said that the Japanese government has expressed its approval after the news that the British government sent Sir Ross, an advisor to the Ministry of Finance, to China as a financial representative. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Investigation of China's Finances, French Representative Appointed, Will Come to China with British Representative in August</h3>
<p>(London) The governments of Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan previously agreed to send financial representatives to China to investigate the currency situation. The British representative has been announced as Sir Ross, an advisor to the Ministry of Finance, who will set off for China in August. The French representative is Mr. Renault, a financial deputy consul at the French Embassy in the United Kingdom, who is an expert in currency issues. He will set off at the same time as Sir Ross. In addition, the candidates for the United States, Italy, and Japan will also be announced soon. According to the speculation of financial experts who are familiar with Far Eastern affairs in this area, when representatives from various countries study China's currency issue, they will divide the country's currency into two types: domestic and foreign. Domestic currency will still be based on silver, but for foreign currency, a new method will be agreed upon. In general, the solutions proposed by representatives from various countries will be based on their own technical positions. In other words, Britain advocates that China's foreign currency be linked to the pound, France advocates that it be linked to gold, and the United States will demand that it be linked to the dollar. London financial figures have very different opinions on the issue of China's foreign currency being linked to the pound. Some express their approval, while others express their opposition. Those who oppose it believe that the addition of such a large country to the pound bloc will easily damage the position of the pound. The Scandinavian countries are also affiliated with the pound bloc, but because of their trade surpluses, the pound's market situation is often affected. This is clear evidence. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Silver Price Rises, Manipulated by Speculators, US Treasury Secretary Replies to Senator's Letter, Already on a Healthy Progress</h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator McCarran today released Secretary of the Treasury Morganthau's letter on the US silver purchase program, stating that the excessive rise in silver prices was caused by speculators and that these unhealthy speculative phenomena have now been eliminated, so it is already on a healthy development path. As for the Treasury Department's silver purchase situation, a total of 421,497,000 ounces were purchased in the ten months ending May 31st, which exceeded the total world silver production during the same period by 265,000,000 ounces. However, the Treasury Secretary declined to state whether the stabilization fund had sold silver. According to McCarran's letter to the Treasury Secretary, he had specifically requested this report, but the Treasury Secretary lightly brushed it aside by saying that the operation of the stabilization fund was not of general interest. The Treasury Secretary's concluding remarks were also a warning to speculators, believing that only speculators would want to question why the government did not publish the details of the stabilization fund. (National News, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today sent a letter to Democratic Senator McCarran regarding rumors that the United States had abandoned its silver purchase program. Silver faction senators recently appointed a five-member committee, chaired by McCarran, to meet with the Treasury Secretary to obtain his views on the Treasury's silver purchase policy. Morgenthau wrote this letter to inform them, stating briefly that the Treasury purchased a total of 421,497,000 ounces of silver in the ten months before the end of May. The excess of 265,000,000 ounces during these ten months is enough to refute the rumors that the government has stopped purchasing silver. As for why silver prices have fallen and whether the Treasury has sold silver, Morgenthau stated that, as far as he knew, the sharp rise in silver prices to 81 cents in the second half of April was not caused by ordinary legal operations in the market, but was the result of manipulation by those with special connections. The elimination of this unstable situation and force is healthy development. Morgenthau did not mention whether the stabilization fund was used to purchase silver, but stated that the purpose of the stabilization fund was related to American policy and was applied to international exchange rates, not to domestic monetary policy, so it would not be beneficial to the public to discuss the use of this fund publicly. If you think about this, you should agree with me. This is the Treasury's consistent policy since the establishment of the stabilization fund. No member of Congress or other government official has ever questioned the Treasury about the use of this fund, which shows that this situation is generally understood and is only related to silver speculation, wanting to question whether this policy is appropriate. During the above-mentioned period, the Treasury purchased 183,000,000 ounces of silver at home and abroad, paid in full, and received 25,640,000 ounces of new silver from mining, while at the same time receiving 12,850,000 ounces of confiscated silver. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) American Bankers Association President Huth today spoke in Omaha, opposing Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's proposal to establish a central bank. Huth stated that such an institution cannot be implemented in the United States because the US financial organization and political background are different. After its establishment, it will be used by the political party that gains power and will not benefit the business community. (National News, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News commented on Hong Kong's ban on silver exports, saying, "The London financial market does not consider this to be unusual, because the sharp rise in silver prices has had a worse effect on China than on Hong Kong. Hong Kong's government's move can prevent the outflow of silver to a considerable extent, and it will also have a good effect on the Hong Kong dollar market, making the Hong Kong dollar no longer closely related to the rise and fall of silver prices. However, its effect cannot be compared with China's imposition of a balancing tax. Moreover, the Hong Kong government's move is largely a cooperative gesture towards China, because most of the silver smuggled out of China is said to pass through Hong Kong to other countries, but there is no real basis to prove this. In short, the Hong Kong government's move and the British government's sending of Sir Ross to China were announced one after another, and there must be a considerable relationship between them. It is conceivable. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>French Finance Minister Decides to Prohibit Gold Bars from Being Used as Collateral for Cash Loans, A Preliminary Step to Curb Speculation</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Finance Minister Regnier and Bank of France President Tangrelli decided today after consultation that the Bank of France should immediately refuse to use gold bars as collateral for cash loans in order to curb speculation. However, the date of implementation has not yet been announced. It is generally believed that this move is closely related to the Bank of England's warning to London banks and major traders last week not to engage in forward gold speculation. The habit of using gold as collateral for cash loans and using it to purchase forward gold hinders the technical defense of the foreign exchange market. It is currently believed in some circles that Paris and London, or even New York, have agreed to eliminate the practice of gold speculation and the plan currently being implemented is aimed at preparing for a general understanding of exchange rates and as a preliminary step for real currency stability. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3>Danzig Controls Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Today, the Danzig Senate convened a meeting to establish an exchange control office to engage in strict control of international exchange rates. The purchase of foreign exchange and the export of cash must be approved by the management office. Residents traveling abroad, whether carrying local currency or purchasing foreign exchange, are subject to this restriction when the amount exceeds 20 Danzig marks per person per month. At the same time, the buying and selling of foreign currency must be exclusively managed by the Danzig Bank, so its price is also determined by the Danzig Bank itself. (National News, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A telegram from Danzig said that a foreign currency management bureau has been established, specializing in the purchase and export of foreign currencies, gold, and silver. In the future, the price of foreign currency will be announced by the Danzig National Bank, and buyers and sellers must trade with the bank. It is believed that the Danzig government wants to maintain its currency at the current price. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>US Senate Passes Bill to Manage Public Utilities, Now Sent to the House of Representatives for Deliberation</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate recently passed the bill proposed by Senators Wheeler and LeRoux by a vote of 56 to 32 and transferred it to the House of Representatives for deliberation. The bill stipulates that private companies engaged in public utilities, namely gas, electricity, water, and tram businesses, that are not beneficial to the public interest of residents, shall be dissolved after seven years. However, if a certain area constitutes an economic unit and it is necessary to gather the various public utilities under a single command organization for management, the private company shall not be dissolved. In addition, among the public utilities, those whose nature is competitive with each other, such as gas and electricity, or those that are mutually used, such as trams, can be operated by the same consortium as usual. In the future, before the liberation, it will be prohibited for them to be operated by the same consortium until the reorganization of the private companies is approved by a vote of the shareholders' meeting. Each shareholder's voting right shall be based on the number of shares, and each preferred share shall only have voting rights. Currently, public utilities are stacked on top of each other and manipulated, resulting in increased prices and damage to users, which should also be prohibited in the future. The above provisions shall be enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission. There are many types of these private companies, and their power is also great, which has always been attacked by people in Wall Street. Now that this bill has been passed, it is tantamount to a death sentence. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate passed the Public Utility Holding Company Bill by a vote of 56 to 32 today. The amendment proposed by the opposition to turn this bill into a common management bill and to stipulate that the government has no right to initiate litigation for the dissolution of holding companies was rejected. However, the amendment proposed by Republican Borah, stipulating that an operating company can only be governed by one holding company, was accepted by a majority of the Senate. Before the final vote on this bill, the opposition strongly criticized it. Democrat Dietrich pointed out that this bill is not a management bill but directly wants to make public utility companies subject to public control. The Senate read a letter from President Roosevelt stating that "any amendment that undermines the main purpose of this bill will be completely contrary to the claims of my address." The amendment accepted by the Senate includes a clause allowing local holding companies to control a small number of non-competing public utilities such as water. Wheeler, who was most vocal in supporting this bill, denied that the bill was unconstitutional. Borah also stated that the right to control holding companies can be implemented using interstate commerce regulations. Those in the Senate who are related to public utilities all fiercely criticized this bill. However, this bill was eventually passed by a majority, which can be seen as a major victory for the government. However, in light of the setbacks of the National Industrial Recovery Act, those who hope that the Senate will have a more generous and cautious attitude towards this bill were greatly disappointed.

<h3>British Veterans to Send Delegation to Germany, British Crown Prince Expresses Approval, German Press Sees Shift in British Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(London) At the annual meeting of British veterans, it was decided to send two delegates to Germany to foster goodwill with German veterans. The British Crown Prince delivered a speech to the British veterans, and the newspapers unanimously praised the move. The Daily News stated that while political problems cannot be solved solely through personal contact, it is not difficult to open a convenient avenue. The Daily Mail stated that fairness and goodwill can dispel many international misunderstandings. The newspaper also sees the remarks of the British Crown Prince praising Goering and Hess as a sign of Anglo-German understanding and anticipates that the British veterans' representatives will receive a warm welcome in Germany. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Major-General Gort, leader of the British Legion, issued a statement to the Daily Mail regarding the delegation's visit to Germany, stating that their visit to Germany this time is unofficial and does not have any specific goals. They only hope to discuss various issues in a spirit of goodwill to promote friendship between veterans of the two countries. Therefore, the purpose of this trip is to fulfill the principle of integrating veterans of all countries recently established by the veterans. The delegation is said to be staying in Berlin for a week. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) British veterans held their annual meeting today. The British Crown Prince attended and delivered a moving speech, strongly supporting Anglo-German understanding. He stated that he personally fully supports the association's sending representatives to visit Germany to enhance relations with German veterans. He also said that when he recently spoke with the president of the British Legion, the president proposed sending representatives to visit Germany, and he had also had this idea for some time. He believes that former soldiers who fought on the front lines are best suited to shake hands with Germans. Although they met on the battlefield in the past, the past is now history. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The newspapers here warmly welcomed the British Crown Prince's speech at the annual meeting of British veterans promoting Anglo-German understanding. A Berlin local newspaper published an article on the front page stating that the British Crown Prince's frank speech was definitely not issued without the government's consent, so it can be seen that there has been a change in thinking on the British side. The proposals put forward by the ministers of the self-governing colonies at the time of the British Emperor's accession to the throne can especially prove this point. Veterans know that respecting the enemy is the most competent mediator to actually eliminate war hatred. The Crown Prince's speech does not lack heroic spirit, so it cannot be compared to empty talk. The spirit it embodies and the praise it has won from British soldiers are the most favorable starting point for future negotiations. The Berliner Tageblatt published a similar argument, stating that Germans have long known that various military organizations are more capable than any organization and diplomatic envoys of enhancing international relations. The visit of British veterans to Germany is especially worthy of attention because the matter was personally announced by the Crown Prince. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The newspapers are widely publishing the speech delivered yesterday by the British Crown Prince, the Prince of Wales, at the annual meeting of the British Legion, considering it to be of great importance and discussing it. The Lokal-Anzeiger reported that "the pro-French policy adopted by the British Foreign Office is not what people in that country want to hear, nor do they want to hear a pro-German policy. What they want to hear is a purely British policy, without relying on France. We can see from the Prince of Wales's frank statement that British public opinion has changed. What the British Crown Prince said is no different from what former veterans have said, which is enough to pave the way for the smooth progress of future Anglo-German negotiations." Other newspapers compared the declaration of the British Prince of Wales with the remarks made yesterday by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels to a reporter from the British News Chronicle, with the headline "A Great Declaration on European Peace."

<h3>Anglo-German Naval Talks to Resume on Thursday</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today's French newspapers reported that Britain and Germany will, in principle, reach a naval agreement to serve as the basis for a future European naval treaty. Germany is reportedly prepared to compromise, agreeing to gradually implement its shipbuilding program in stages and to limit the tonnage of each warship. After the principles of this agreement are established, France will have the opportunity to speak. It is expected that a general compromise cannot be achieved in a moment, as France will have many opinions to express on what it deems necessary. However, the commentary issued by the Paris Echo differs from this. According to reports, if the Washington Naval Treaty is not re-established this year, and the United States, Britain, and Japan start a shipbuilding race, the German naval standard will naturally increase, so the 35% ratio is sufficient to resolve the problems caused by Germany's restoration of naval power. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-German naval talks, which were suspended due to Pentecost, will resume on Thursday. At that time, Hitler's special envoy Ribbentrop and German naval experts will return to London. Ribbentrop has reported the results of the London talks to the German head of state during this holiday. It is expected that a draft agreement will be drawn up soon, containing an understanding between Britain and Germany regarding relative naval strength, namely that the German navy will be equal to 25% of the British navy. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government recently asked the Japanese government for its opinion on Germany's request to place warships with a tonnage of 35% of that of the British fleet. It has now received a reply from the Japanese government. According to unofficial sources, the Japanese government has no objection to Germany's request and still insists on Japan's demand for naval equality with Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British government recently informed the French government of the progress of the Anglo-German naval talks. This communication is currently being jointly studied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy. After a decision is made at tomorrow's cabinet meeting, a response will be drafted and sent to the British government. According to well-informed sources, as a result of the Anglo-German naval talks, Britain has initially allowed the German navy to account for 35% of British tonnage. However, the British are quite concerned about how Germany will allocate this total tonnage and whether each type of warship will be built according to this ratio. Therefore, the British side is eager to learn the details of Germany's naval shipbuilding plan. The German naval representative, Ribbentrop, has now returned to Berlin and will come to London soon, presumably to provide the British government with a favorable response. It is heard that the French government is also eager to know the details of Germany's naval shipbuilding plan. According to naval countries, it is planned to hold a naval conference before the expiration of the Washington Naval Treaty. If a naval agreement is concluded with Germany, what impact will this have on the future naval conference? This is currently unknown. Moreover, if Britain, France, and Italy allow Germany to build a navy, it is tantamount to acknowledging the complete alteration of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which is also a difficult problem. Not only that, but some believe that naval negotiations with Germany must be held simultaneously with the various talks stipulated in the London Declaration of February 3. If other security conventions are not discussed, the German naval issue cannot be finally resolved. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Bans Four British Newspapers from Entering Italy</h3>

<p>Addis Ababa, Abyssinia - On the 4th of this month, the Italian Minister to Abyssinia, regarding the recent border clashes between Italian and Abyssinian soldiers, claimed to the Italian Minister that no Abyssinian soldiers participated in the clash mentioned in the Italian protest of the 4th of this month. Abyssinian soldiers were only ordered to stay at Defonga. On the contrary, the Abyssinian Sless tribe grazing near Defonga was attacked by the Italian Reyannas tribe. The Sless tribe resisted, and the invaders were repelled. Therefore, the Abyssinian government has protested to Italy regarding the invasion of Abyssinian territory. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Preparations for Wenzhou Paper Mill</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Mr. Liu Weichi, along with British consultant Stuart Watt, experts Yang Zongmi and Jin Han, etc., went to Wenzhou at the end of last month to survey the site for the paper mill. After returning to Nanjing, it was reported that preparations for the paper mill have been going on for more than a year and the plan has long been finalized. More than 4 million yuan in official shares have been approved by the Boxer Indemnity Fund Association, but it is difficult to allocate them at once. Mr. Wang Yunwu and others are trying to raise 1.2 million in commercial shares. Mr. Liu's opinion is that Wenzhou is suitable as the factory site, as there are no problems with transportation and raw materials. However, it is still difficult to solve the electricity generation problem, whether to use water power or coal. Although burning coal saves on opening expenses, the costs are significant. Water power requires redundant construction of active dams and machinery and equipment, which is very expensive. The decision on which to use will be decided at the official and commercial shareholders' meeting. Regarding the output of paper, it is planned to produce 35 tons of newsprint per day, about 10,000 tons per year, which is not enough to supply the Shanghai newspapers. Production will be increased later to ensure that newspapers across the country can purchase it. However, it is not yet possible to talk about the output of paper materials.

In recent years, they have frequently suffered from floods and droughts, resulting in poor harvests. Farmers have struggled to afford food and clothing, and starvation has been a concern. This year's wheat harvest is now nearing completion. According to surveys of wheat harvests in the Xuzhou region, with the exception of the three counties of Sui, Pi, and Su, which suffered from sudden wind and hail damage when the wheat was setting, the remaining counties of Tong, Xiao, Feng, Pei, Dang, and Huaihai have all reported abundant harvests. The average yield is approximately seven to eight dou per mu. When new wheat is brought to market, the selling price is around five jiao per dou. Farmers typically sell their new wheat to repay debts and purchase clothing, but the market price of new wheat is extremely low, forcing them to sell against their will. Last year, new wheat sold for only three jiao per dou, while rice prices soared to six jiao per dou in one month. As a result, merchants who purchased new wheat earned more than half their profits in one month. This year, the banking sector has recognized that loans to urban industries and businesses have often resulted in bankruptcies and losses. In recent years, most bank failures have been due to the woes of commercial merchants. Therefore, this year, in addition to conducting secured loans, banks have completely overturned all credit loans, and merchant credit has plummeted. Although the Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly attempted to persuade banks to provide loans, all banks have refused. Furthermore, due to the fact that Farmers' Banks have been investing in rural areas for many years, specializing in mortgage grain loans, enjoying good credit, and receiving full repayment of principal and interest on schedule, with substantial profits, various banks are following the example of Farmers' Banks and changing their business strategies by investing in rural areas. Recently, in addition to the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank's rural loan program, other banks such as the National Bank, the Shanghai Bank, and the China Farmers' Bank are actively establishing warehouses and providing guidance for cooperation in the counties of Xuzhou this year, specializing in farmers' storage and mortgage of grain in exchange for cash loans. When grain prices rise next spring, they will then deliver the grain to farmers for sale, paying both principal and interest. Banks also handle transportation and sales matters, enabling agricultural products to connect with other ports, increasing commodity prices, and preventing low grain prices from harming farmers. Therefore, this year, the wheat harvest in northern Jiangsu is abundant, and farmers are cheering for a bumper year. With the mortgage loans from banks, they will not have to sell new wheat against their will, and rural economies will be able to regulate and adjust. The future of urban industries and businesses should be able to move toward a similar prosperous situation.</p>

<h3>Panic Over Food Supply Worsening in Counties Under Puppet Organizations Due to Ban on Planting Sorghum and Shortage of Grain; Puppet Provinces and Counties All Prohibit Grain from Leaving Their Borders</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In the four northeastern provinces, due to the puppet organizations' prohibition on planting sorghum, in order to prevent the hiding of righteous armies, only crops such as wheat that are not particularly tall and dense are permitted to be planted. Furthermore, the harvest was poor last year, resulting in an extreme shortage of grain this year. Grain prices have soared, and the food problem in various counties and villages has become critical. The people are hungry and resentful, and their voices reach the sky. Currently, the puppet Fengtian Provincial authorities have issued orders prohibiting grain from leaving the province and ordering all counties to prohibit grain from leaving the county, demonstrating the severity of their grain panic. The food panic situation in the various counties of the puppet province is described below:</p>
<p>Zhangwu County: The harvest was poor last year, and there has been an unusual drought since the spring and summer of this year. Grain prices have skyrocketed. Currently, one dou of sorghum is priced at a staggering two yuan and seventy-eight jiao. The number of unemployed farmers is increasing daily, and many have joined the righteous army because they have no way to make a living (this is why the Northeast Righteous Army has been very active recently). Although village chiefs have established food relief maintenance associations to investigate grain reserves, and the puppet county magistrate has prohibited grain from leaving the county, this has only caused panic.</p>
<p>Qingyuan County: The puppet county government investigated grain reserves within the county and determined that they were severely insufficient. It then issued a puppet order instructing distilleries under its jurisdiction to stop brewing alcohol.</p>
<p>Fushun County: The county's civilian grain supply has historically been mostly supplied by the eastern border region. Since the spring of this year, grain shipments have been extremely scarce, forcing them to rely on other counties. However, grain prices are extremely high, and all counties prohibit grain from leaving their borders. The county's lack of civilian food has reached an extreme point. The people are restless and there is a tendency for civil unrest. The puppet authorities are deeply frightened and are urgently formulating countermeasures.</p>
<p>Xinmin County: The county produces slightly more grain than other counties, so the famine situation is not as serious. However, the puppet county authorities are still ordering that grain not leave the county in order to prevent a major famine from occurring in the future.</p>
<p>Yi County: The puppet county authorities issued a puppet order to maintain civilian food supplies, prohibiting the export of grains such as sorghum, millet, buckwheat, and other grains.</p>
<p>Suizhong County: The county currently has a grain reserve of over 11,700 shi, while the public's need for grain is over 47,800 shi, leaving a shortfall of over 36,100 shi. Furthermore, the continuous drought has eliminated any hope of a harvest from spring plowing, and grain prices are rising daily, causing the people to become increasingly fearful. The county is now in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>Heishan County: Although the Heishan puppet county authorities have issued official documents prohibiting the export of grain, this has not been effectively implemented, and the storage is extremely small. The general public feels a great fear of a lack of food.</p>
<p>Chaoyang County: The Chaoyang puppet county authorities have not yet issued a prohibition on the export of grains or other concrete remedial measures, so the public is extremely apprehensive.</p>
<p>Xi'an County: The Xi'an puppet county authorities have issued a puppet order prohibiting the export of grain, but the actual situation is the opposite. In early May, there was still 10,000 shi of accumulated sorghum, but by early June, it had decreased by 6,000 shi, so the public's food supply is also severely inadequate. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Shang Zhen Assumes Office as the Tianjin Garrison Commander and Acting Mayor</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The newly appointed Tianjin Garrison Commander and Acting Mayor Shang Zhen arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 8th. On the morning of the 9th, he went to the municipal government on Hebei-Japan Latitude Road to assume his position as the acting mayor. The municipal government received the news beforehand and made arrangements overnight. Former Mayor Zhang Ting'e personally went to the municipal government to hand over the seal of office. Mr. Shang arrived at the municipal government at 8:10 AM. After a brief rest, he held a simple ceremony in the municipal government's auditorium. More than a hundred people, including the directors of various bureaus under the municipality and all the staff of the municipal government, participated. After performing the formalities, Zhang Ting'e handed over the seal of office. After receiving the seal, Mr. Shang addressed all the staff, briefly saying that he had received an order from the Executive Yuan to temporarily act as the mayor of Tianjin because Mayor Wang Shu'lu had not yet arrived in the north. Many of the colleagues here are old friends, and the previous mayor achieved excellent results during his tenure. He is only serving temporarily and did not bring anyone with him, so he would not change any of the current personnel. He hoped that everyone would consider the three aspects of the country, the local area, and personal friendship and work hard to help. Next, Zhang Ting'e delivered a farewell speech to the staff, saying that he had made no achievements in the past and that he greatly admired Mr. Shang's spirit in coming to take office and bear the heavy burden during this serious diplomatic period. After finishing his speech, Mr. Zhang left the government and returned to his residence. Mr. Shang then summoned the directors of various bureaus under the municipality to inquire about the municipal situation and met with the press to make a statement, saying that his coming here was of a temporary nature and that he hoped everyone would help him from time to time. Mr. Shang then went to the former site of the provincial government to assume the position of Tianjin Garrison Commander. However, as everything in the Garrison Command Headquarters was still waiting to be arranged, no ceremony was held. He officially began working that day. Furthermore, Municipal Government Secretary-General Wang Yu'ke had previously requested to resign. After being approved by Acting Mayor Shang, he appointed Mr. Wang Bingzhe, the Deputy Chairman of the Municipal Government Statistics Committee, to serve concurrently on a temporary basis. Moreover, after assuming the position of mayor, Shang Zhen issued an inaugural telegram, the original text of which is as follows: (Omitted titles) Everyone is aware that I received a telegram from the Executive Yuan on the seventh of the solar month, stating that before Tianjin Mayor Wang Ke'min arrives, Tianjin Garrison Commander Shang Zhen should temporarily serve as the Mayor of Tianjin, etc. On June 9th, I received the seal of office and began my duties. In addition to sending separate telegrams and letters, I am sending this special telegram for your information. Tianjin Mayor Shang Zhen respectfully greets you (9th) Seal. After the provincial capital was relocated, Tianjin Municipality was changed to be directly under the Executive Yuan. The Public Security Bureau was restored to municipal control. The new Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau will be Liu Yushu, the Secretary-General appointed by the Pingjin Military Branch. Liu arrived in Tianjin at 11:45 AM on the morning of the 9th and is scheduled to go to the bureau at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 10th to begin his duties. The furniture of the former Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau will be handed over by Li Junxiang. According to Mr. Li's statement to reporters, the Provincial Government's Public Security Bureau should have been closed after the provincial government was relocated. However, because no one was responsible for the local area, he temporarily maintained it. Now that Commander Shang has arrived in Tianjin and the new Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Liu Yushu, is also preparing to take office, he will hand over the furniture of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau after meeting with him and then submit it to the provincial government and the municipal government for supplementary procedures. After completing the handover, he will temporarily stay in Tianjin to handle the matter of the changing of guards for the 51st Army. After this matter is completed, he will return to serve in the headquarters of the 51st Army. (10th)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Shandong University Compensation Issue; Han Fu'qu and the Japanese Consul Consulted with Labor and Management and Decided to Give 330 Yuan to Each Family of the Deceased; The Relief Committee Resolved to Erect a Monument and a Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fu'qu departed from Jinan on the evening of the 9th. The special train stopped at the Zaoyuan Temple Station that night and departed at 4:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, arriving at Zhoucun at 5:10 AM. The commander of the 22nd Division, Gu Liangmin, led the division staff and a company of pistol-wielding soldiers to welcome him at the station. Wu Liansheng, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, also led all the police officers and gentry and merchants. After Han exchanged greetings with the welcomers, he practiced martial arts with his advisors, Guo Zhigang and Ge Jinzhang, as well as the Tongzi Performance Troupe of the National Arts Hall, which was selected to participate in the National Arts City Examination in Qingdao, Yang Guanghan, and others on the train. At 6:00 AM, Han went to the Jindehui to participate in the commemorative weekly meeting and lectured to the students of the garrison troops, the police officers of the Public Security Bureau, the Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol Taxes, the Bureau of Industry, and the public, speaking on the meaning of Jindehui. At 7:30 AM, he returned to the station for breakfast. The train departed at 9:00 AM and arrived at Zhangdian at 9:30 AM. Ning Chunxiao, the commander of the 64th Brigade, led the troops to welcome him at the station. Han immediately ordered Ning to invite Gao Heng, the special director of Shandong University in Qingdao, and Shiyoshi, the Japanese special director, to Zhangdian to discuss the Shandong University aftermath. The Japanese consul stationed in Zhangdian and the Japanese consul stationed in Jinan, Nishida, also rushed from Jinan. They strongly invited Han to visit Zichuan. At 10:30 AM, Han and Nishida and Ning Chunxiao left Zhangdian by special train and arrived in Zichuan at 11:00 AM. Zhang Yunzao, the county magistrate, Wang Guojun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and all civil servants, as well as Gu Chi and other standing committee members of the Dinghui, all welcomed him at the station. Che Tian Zichuan was reopened to the Shan mining area, and Zhang Yunzao, Gu Chi, and others also traveled on the same train. At 11:50 AM, Han arrived after getting off the train. The Shandong University company hosted them at the club for a rest. Han then invited Japanese Consul Nishida and important Chinese and Japanese personnel from Shandong University to discuss the aftermath. Regarding the compensation for the deceased workers, Shandong University only agreed to give 302 yuan per person according to custom, plus 10 yuan for the outer coffin, for a total of 312 yuan. The families of the deceased demanded a special compensation of 500 yuan per person because Shandong University could not drain the water to retrieve the bodies, but Shandong University did not agree. Although the aftermath committee had been established for many days, there was no solution due to the large differences in opinions between labor and management. Since Ning Chunxiao arrived in Hongshan on the 9th and proposed a compromise solution, requesting Shandong University to allocate an additional 40,000 yuan for compensation, Shandong University still did not agree. Song Biru then went to Qingdao to negotiate with the Shandong University management, but no progress was made. Therefore, after Han arrived, he first discussed this point with the Shandong University company. As a result, Shandong University agreed to give 330 yuan to each family of the deceased worker to show preferential compensation. Han himself also donated 540 yuan, giving one yuan to each family of the deceased worker. Thus, the compensation issue was resolved. At 1:00 PM, Han went to inspect the accident mine shaft and then went to the West Mountain and Liangshui Pond with Japanese Consul Nishida. At 2:00 PM, they returned to the Shandong University office together. Five or six hundred family members of the deceased workers, hearing that Han had arrived in the mining area, asked to see him. Han agreed to meet them at the Shandong University Elementary School at 5:00 PM. At that time, the family members of the deceased workers gathered in the elementary school. Japanese Consul Nishida, Brigade Commander Ning Chunxiao, County Magistrate Zhang Yunzao, Union Chairman Gu Chi, and others accompanied Han. Han spoke, first expressing his condolences, then introducing Nishida to speak, who also added his condolences. Han then gave a long speech and announced the compensation method of Shandong University, asking those who agreed to raise their hands. Everyone raised their hands. He also said that all those who agreed should stand on the east side of the field. As a result, everyone went to stand on the east side of the field, with only two or three people not going. Han, believing that everyone had agreed, instructed County Magistrate Zhang Yunzao and Brigade Commander Ning Chunxiao to handle the matter properly and to have the funds withdrawn and distributed to the families of the deceased by the union. At 6:30 PM, Han returned to the club. Gao Heng, the special director of the Shandong University company, Fujii, the business director, and Song Biru and others arrived from Qingdao by Jiaoji Railway to visit Han and express their gratitude for resolving the aftermath. Han urged Shandong University to resume work and asked in detail about opening new wells and draining old wells. At 10:00 PM, Han left Shan and went to Zichuan for the night. The next morning, on the 11th, he went to Yidu for inspection.</p>
<p>Now that the Shandong University company's compensation issue has been resolved, the Aftermath Committee held its second formal meeting on the 11th, passing six compensation methods and resolving to erect a memorial monument and establish a public cemetery, as well as hold a memorial service. The methods passed at the meeting are recorded below: A. Shandong University Company, Zichuan Mining Office, Ten Line Deceased Workers Compensation Method: After investigating the water disaster that occurred at Ten Line this time, which was an unprecedented disaster for the company, the rescue situation has been understood by all parties. From the current situation, it is not easy to retrieve the bodies. If they are retrieved in the future, it may be difficult to identify them, delaying the time and causing disputes. To avoid disputes, this committee has formulated six specific methods, listed one by one below for compliance: (1) This time, there are ten deceased inner-mine workers and 526 outer-mine workers, to be handled according to the company's usual compensation methods. (2) Because the bodies of the deceased workers are not easy to retrieve this time, the company expresses its apologies and gives 28 yuan to each family of the deceased to cover living expenses. Regardless of whether the bodies are retrieved in the future, no further demands shall be made. (3) The compensation for inner-mine workers will be paid directly by the company. The compensation for outer-mine workers will be handed over by the company to the county government for distribution in full. The detailed methods will be determined separately by this committee. (4) The company will hold a memorial service on a regular basis and notify all families of the deceased to participate at will. (5) Regardless of whether the bodies of the deceased workers are retrieved this time, the company will first select a suitable location to erect a memorial monument and engrave the names of the deceased workers one by one to commemorate them. However, when the bodies can be retrieved in the future, the company will establish a public cemetery in the location of the memorial monument for joint burial. (6) This method will be implemented after being passed by the committee. B. Regarding how the detailed methods for the distribution of compensation should be determined, please make a public decision. It was decided to hand it over to the county government, the Shandong University company, the Zibo union, and the local community to discuss and handle jointly, and to begin distribution on the 13th. The motion was read out, and the meeting adjourned. The minutes were handed over to the county government for preservation. (11th)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Municipal Government Consults with the Ministry of Finance to Rescue Various Industries; Adopt Recommendations of the Economic Discussion Conference and Allocate Large Sums to Rescue the Business Community</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the collapse of Minghua Bank in Qingdao, the financial community has formed an unprecedentedly serious situation. Credit has tightened sharply, people are panicked, and various industries are feeling uneasy. The Qingdao Economic Discussion Conference, in order to quickly seek maintenance, specially proposed a suggestion from the financial group, requesting the municipal government to petition the central government to order the financial industry to allocate large sums of money to rescue Qingdao's industry and commerce. The original text of the suggestion stated, "The establishment of this conference to study economic matters should be based on factual investigations, formulate plans, and gradually implement them to promote the development of the city's industry and commerce and the prosperity of the market is a fundamental solution. However, this city is suffering from the impact of the global economic downturn, and industry and commerce have declined to an extreme point. At present, there are hundreds of large and small stores that cannot maintain their operations and are urgently awaiting closure, reporting to the Chamber of Commerce. If special methods are not established to rescue them, then the city's entire market will decline further and further, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Reports say that the central government has ordered the financial industry to raise 20 million yuan for Shanghai to lend to various industries to provide rescue. The environment of this city is no less than that of Shanghai, and the total amount of annual income collected by the Qingdao Customs accounts for the third largest in the country. In order to maintain the port with more tariff income, the central government should not allow this city to become paralyzed. It is proposed that the conference suggest to the municipal government to petition the central government to order the financial headquarters to allocate several million yuan to this city to be lent to the city's endangered industries and businesses in order to salvage them. This is a short-term emergency plan to rescue the city's market. Is it feasible? Your public decision is respectfully awaited." The municipal government, based on the presentation, recognized that the various sections presented by the conference were extremely important and immediately consulted with the Ministry of Finance, writing, "According to the presentation of this city's Economic Discussion Conference (original text omitted) and other circumstances, after investigation, the matter of rescuing this city's industry and commerce, the City Chamber of Commerce previously presented a request to transfer and earnestly request your Honorable Mayor to approve and provide rescue according to the rescue methods of Shanghai's industry and commerce. At that time, the situation of various industries here was indeed extremely critical, so on April 30th, we consulted you for review and handling. Now, the situation is turbulent and even more precarious. The Bank of China and Russia experienced runs, and this government worked with the Banking Association to maintain the situation with great effort, barely stabilizing it. However, before even ten days had passed, Minghua Bank also announced its collapse. In such a small area, runs, withdrawals, and bankruptcies have occurred one after another within more than ten days. Rumors have spread, and the market is tense in an unprecedented way. People are panicking and cannot live in peace. If the situation is allowed to develop, industry, commerce, and finance will all perish together, and it is feared that the impact will affect all parts of the country. To overcome this situation of doubt and turbulence, there is no other solution than to raise a large sum of money for real rescue. The conference's request to order financial institutions to allocate funds to be lent to this city's industry and commerce is indeed the only way to solve the current crisis. I once again earnestly appeal to Your Excellency the Minister to approve the request and kindly grant a quick review and reply to strengthen public friendship." (June 10th)</p>
<h3>Han Zishi and Others Petition for the Urgent Opening of the Lake Ports for Relief Transportation; Chairman Chen Has Telegraphed Director Shen to Comply</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: Since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain in the counties north of the Jiangsu River in Jiangsu Province, and a drought has appeared. The gentry Han Zishi and others yesterday specially telegraphed Provincial Chairman Chen Guofu and Construction Director Shen Baixian, requesting that the ports be opened in a timely manner for relief transportation in order to provide relief. It is heard that Chairman Chen has approved the request and telegraphed Director Shen, who is inspecting river works in Huaiyin, to comply with the order immediately. The original telegram from Han and others is recorded below: "The water in the canal has dried up, and a drought has appeared. Late rice is waiting to be transplanted, and early seedlings are about to wither. The rural areas are in dire straits. After the floods in northern Jiangsu, how can they withstand another drought? It has been investigated that the lake water at the Jiusheng Port and Qilizha in Gaobao and other places is one to two feet higher than the canal water. However, after the western embankment was dammed, lake transport was blocked, and irrigation was impossible. It seems appropriate to open the ports in a timely manner for relief transportation, which is more convenient than any other method. Blocking them again afterwards will not hinder the guidance of the Huai River project, and the cost in the future will also be less, while the gains at this time will be great. Farmers take the fields as their lives, and the lives and properties of tens of counties in the east are enormous and of great importance. If the situation is not remedied early, if an incident occurs, there will be special responsibility. Director Shen of Construction is currently inspecting the works in northern Huai, and it is requested that Director Shen be telegraphed to quickly select ports to open and save lives. I think the Chairman cares about the people's suffering and will be able to weigh the pros and cons and make a decisive decision, lest it be too late. Urgent awaiting orders."</p>
<h3>Salt and Kerosene in Jiangxi Province Operated by Cooperatives to Avoid Exploitation and Manipulation by Merchants; The Military Headquarters Orders the Provincial Government to Transfer the Order to Various Counties for Compliance</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to eliminate banditry, has specially sealed off the bandit areas, and salt, kerosene, and daily necessities are all subject to control, so that not even a drop can leak into the hands of the bandits. At present, the Red Bandits in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian have been gradually suppressed, and the counties where the scattered bandits have been eliminated and the Baojia system has been completed will have the blockade lifted in order to restore normalcy and free circulation. However, the phased lifting of the blockade issued by the Military Headquarters stipulated that after the abolition of the public sale of salt and kerosene, they should be handed over to the joint cooperatives of the respective counties for centralized operation, which can establish the foundation of a controlled economy, reduce the manipulation and exploitation of intermediaries, and promote the development of cooperative undertakings. Original oil and salt traders will also be accommodated if they can invest, so as to avoid their unemployment. It is heard that the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have successively centralized the operation of oil and salt in cooperatives. Previously, the British and American envoys had a misunderstanding about the centralized public sale of kerosene, which was also explained in detail and relayed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British and American envoys to inform foreign merchants (such as Standard Oil and Butterfield &amp; Swire). (6th, 7th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Using Baojia System to Eradicate Locusts</h3>
<p>The eighth district of the county, bordering the coast, has suffered from severe crop failures in recent years due to drought. Recently, locusts were discovered in Chongque Township in the district. Lu Chunrong, the township leader and Baojia chief, reported this to Wu Changding, the district head, who recognized the seriousness of the situation and telegraphed the county government, requesting that technician Chen Xingyuan from the Rice Crop Experiment Field be sent to investigate. At the same time, the district head and Xu Anshi, the township head, were instructed to listen to technician Chen's guidance and to diligently carry out the work. Technician Chen then returned to Songjiang and reported that the initially discovered locust-infested area was only a dozen acres. Xu Qingchang, the township head, supervised the Baojia chiefs in using tools and purchasing several cans of kerosene to cut down and burn the surrounding reeds to eradicate the locusts. Recently, however, the locust-infested area has been found to have reached over a hundred acres. If measures are not taken to search and destroy them, it is feared that it will cause great harm. County Magistrate Jin decided to take this opportunity to test the Baojia system. He ordered District Head Wu to mobilize all township, Baojia, and household chiefs. At the same time, he ordered thirty men from the security brigade stationed in Shanyang, as well as the chiefs of the nine branch police stations, to start searching and capturing locusts at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th. County Magistrate Jin and Director of Public Security He set off by car at 7:00 a.m. on the 11th and arrived at the location. District Head Wu had already led his subordinates to wait, along with the heads of the three townships of Zhalin, Huqiao, and Caojing, as well as elementary school teachers and staff, totaling about 1,400 to 1,500 people. According to the plan set by technician Chen, the area surrounding the locust-infested area was cleared to prevent them from escaping. Then, vertical and horizontal roads were opened up in the district, and the area was divided into sections, each assigned to a Baojia chief to supervise the household chiefs in cutting grass and using tools to eradicate the locusts. The county government bought the locusts for 160 cash per pound. From morning to night, more than a thousand pounds were collected. The grass was cleared, and more than half of the locusts were eliminated, so they should not spread. Before leaving, County Magistrate Jin ordered District Head Wu and others to continue eradicating the locusts yesterday and scheduled to return to the countryside on the 13th to inspect for any remaining locusts. At the same time, locusts were also discovered in more than a dozen acres in Niangniangmiao Township in the district. Township Head Lu was ordered to use the Baojia system to eradicate them simultaneously yesterday. It is said that they were almost completely searched and captured within four hours. County Magistrate Jin led his subordinates to inspect in person and praised them greatly. County Magistrate Jin returned to Songjiang and told people that this locust eradication was greatly benefited from the Baojia system; otherwise, it would not have been so swift and effective.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Husband Stabs Wife and Daughter-in-Law with Knife</h3>
<p>Lu Gao, 52 years old, lives at No. 1 Qigan Lane, Huxiangsi Lane, in this city. Her husband, Lu Xiaodi, does not engage in honest work and has been separated from Lu Gao for more than twenty years. Her son, Gao Weilin, is in his twenties and works at Mao Hai Foreign Firm in Shanghai. He is married to a Chen woman and has a son and a daughter. Weilin lives with his mother. Recently, Lu Xiaodi learned that his son was working at a foreign firm, so he returned home, and his wife could not refuse him. However, Lu Xiaodi relapsed into his old habits, making excessive demands of his wife and son. His wife refused, so Lu Xiaodi harbored resentment. At 7:00 p.m. on the 11th, he took a kitchen knife and slashed his wife, Lu, and then slashed his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. The three injured people all collapsed to the ground in pain, lying in pools of blood. Lu Xiaodi, seeing that he had caused trouble, immediately fled. Neighbors heard the cries for help and rushed to see what had happened. After learning the details, they reported to the police precinct in charge and sent the injured people to Boxi Hospital for treatment. Because they were not critically injured, their lives were not in danger. The police precinct in charge immediately dispatched police to arrest the murderer, but his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Exhumation After Brother is Buried Alive</h3>
<p>Xu Heshang from Dongqian Township, Ouchi Town, killed his biological brother, Tan Songsong, and buried him alive in the Luojia Duan Mulberry Field. On the 10th, someone discovered this and reported it to the county. Xu Heshang, the murderer, was arrested. The case caused a sensation and drew great attention from society. According to the confession, his brother had a wandering nature and repeatedly asked for money. On the 6th, they had a mutual fight in the Shi Surname Hotel. The next day, he vomited and died in the afternoon. Fearing accusations, he buried him in the field without a coffin, but he did not admit to killing him. On the afternoon of the 11th, the county government sent personnel to the countryside to inspect and exhume the body in the presence of the murderer. However, due to the hot weather, the stench was unbearable. Although there were many onlookers, they all covered their noses. As a result, it was found that the deceased had a hole in the back of his head from a blow, his left finger was chopped open, and there were strangulation marks on his neck, indicating that he had been strangled to death before being buried. However, it was definitely not the act of one person. The township police then put the coffin in place, and the county government detained Jin Heshang pending investigation.</p>

Military and police authorities have been fully mobilized and are searching for the thieves in different directions, hoping to capture them.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: County Forcibly Replaces Opium Smoking Licenses</h3>
<p>Hou Tanzong, the county magistrate of Wuyi County and chairman of the Opium Prohibition Committee, since following provincial orders to replace the first phase of opium smoking licenses, most opium smokers have delayed and waited. Although the deadline has been extended several times, there are still many who have not replaced their licenses. Therefore, it has been decided to forcibly replace the licenses, so that the second phase of license matters can be concluded in a short period of time. On the 11th, investigators Huang Bingzhong and Li Duan and members of the Investigation and Seizure Section were dispatched to various districts to forcibly replace licenses based on the opium smoker register. If they continue to delay and refuse to replace, they will be detained and forced to quit. In addition, Wuyi has organized five rounds of summoning opium smokers to quit. The sixth batch of summoning list has been drafted by the County Opium Prohibition Committee and is limited to June 20th, all must enter the county opium prohibition center to receive treatment.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Court Convenes to Discuss Encroachment on Land</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu Branch Court, due to Jin Xunzhi and others encroaching on the site of the old Ganquan County Government, and even encroaching on the court site, has now followed the order of the High Court to convene various committee meetings that previously planned the establishment of the court. A meeting was held specifically on the morning of the 11th to discuss and decide: (1) The part of the Zhuyuan that the court has recovered has been proven by the attendees to be the site of the old Ganquan County Government. (2) In addition to the three official houses for which the Jin surname reported to claim, the front and back sites are also the site of the old County Government.

<p>The five measures decided by the Money Industry Special Committee, including fund transfers, borrowing against collateral, and discounts, have been approved by the Banking Industry Association, the Comprador Association of Foreign Banks, and the Money Industry Supervision Committee, and have been implemented separately. All fund transfers from banks to money shops must be transferred to the Money Industry Joint Reserve Depository. Money shops will no longer accept fund transfers from banks. The artificial fluctuation of the money market, "Hua Tou Jia Shui," has been suspended from being listed, and is handled by the Money Industry Reserve Depository.</p>

The Banking Association specifically convened an emergency executive committee meeting to discuss and approve it, and stipulated five measures to be followed by all banks.

<p>Banking Association Issues Announcement for Compliance</p>
<p>Based on the emergency meeting on the case of unified delivery of fund transfer notes to the Money Depository, the Banking Association issued an announcement yesterday morning to all banks and the Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee for compliance. The original text is as follows: Dear Sirs, After investigating the fact that the Money Industry Association made five new resolutions yesterday to refresh the business of money shops, which have been implemented after public announcement. The first item is, "All fund transfers from banks currently deposited in various money shops must be transferred to the Money Depository at the same time. From now on, money shops will no longer accept fund transfers from banks." This measure is extremely important for the revenue and expenditure of the banking industry. The Association urgently convened an executive committee meeting on the 11th (today) at 2:00 p.m. to discuss the response. The measures decided are as follows: (1) Fund transfers deposited in money shops by all banks until the 11th will be transferred to the Money Depository from the 12th, opening accounts for transactions. (2) In the future, all fund transfer notes from member money shops received by all banks from customers on a daily basis will be sent to the Money Depository. If fund transfer funds are to be used, they will be drawn from the Money Depository. Fund transfer notes received from foreign and non-member money shops will be collected by senior clerks dispatched by the banks. (3) If banks must settle any shortages, they can use fund transfer notes deposited in the Money Depository to settle at market rates. In addition to drawing from the market, the Money Depository can negotiate with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications for borrowing in case of any shortages. The interest rate will be determined by the three banks. (4) When banks must transport cash to various ports, they can request the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to handle the fund transfer according to the fund transfer procedures. (5) The restrictions on the method of fund transfer funds deposited in the exchange according to the Joint Reserve Committee's Circular No. 74 will continue to apply for the time being. The above resolutions are trial measures, and it has been decided to organize a subcommittee immediately to discuss them in detail. If there are any areas that need improvement, another meeting will be held for discussion and another announcement will be issued. Please comply accordingly. It is also learned that after receiving the above announcement, the Banking Reserve Committee immediately notified all banks of the Note Exchange yesterday morning to comply accordingly.</p>

<p>Welcoming Personnel</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, people from all walks of life in China and Japan went to the Huishan Wharf to welcome Ambassador Ariyoshi to Shanghai, including Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Li, Secretary, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General representing Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Commissioner Wang Changchun, and from the Japanese side, Matsumoto Tadao, Special Envoy of the Japanese Government visiting China, Horiuchi, Counselor of the Embassy, Yokokawa, Commercial Counselor, Izawa, Military Attaché, Sato, Naval Attaché, Kobeto, Deputy Naval Attaché, Ishii, Consul General in Shanghai, Suma, Consul General in Beijing, Vice Admiral Araki, Commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, Sugisaka, Commander of the Japanese Navy Landing Forces stationed in Shanghai, and more than 300 Japanese residents.</p>
<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>Ambassador Ariyoshi, accompanied by Ariyoshi, Counselor of the Embassy, and Yokokawa, Secretary, departed from Kobe on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru on the 10th to take office in China. Mrs. Ariyoshi plans to come to China after spending the summer in Japan. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, but due to encountering wind en route, it was delayed until approximately 4:00 p.m. before docking at the Huishan Wharf. All welcomers boarded the ship to welcome him after the ship docked, and then disembarked and went to the Japanese Consulate General to rest.

<p>Spokesman</p>
<p>After the Japanese Ambassador returned to the Consulate General, he met with Chinese news reporters and made the following statement, "I have returned to the country this time to report on the situation of my mission to China. With the elevation of the rank of envoys between the two countries, I have been entrusted with the mission to China, and I should continue the spirit of the past to promote the friendship between the two countries in the future. The Japanese government and the public have great expectations for Sino-Japanese friendship, so after the elevation of the rank of envoys between the two countries, I wish that the relations between the two countries will become even more friendly. As for the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, it is indeed the only essential factor for promoting the friendship between the two countries. During my return to the country, I have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the business community several times, but no results have been obtained. As for the issue of moving the embassy to Beijing, the Japanese side has this hope, but it is difficult to find a suitable location in Nanjing for a while, so it is difficult to realize it in the short term. I am scheduled to take the early train to Beijing on the morning of the 13th and meet with Chairman Lin of the National Government at 11:00 a.m. on the morning of the 14th to present my credentials. After staying in Beijing for a short time, I will return to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Tax Bureau Telegraphically Summons Heads of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureaus to Shanghai for Meeting: Attendees Include Ten Provinces Such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; Consultations on the Problem of Consolidating Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Revenue; Meeting to be Held for Two Days Starting on the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance recently telegraphed the heads of the stamp duty, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus in ten provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, and Hunan, ordering them to come to Shanghai before the 20th of this month to discuss the issue of consolidating stamp duty, tobacco, and alcohol tax revenue. A reporter specifically visited Mr. Chen, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the department, yesterday morning, who provided the following details:</p>
<p>Scheduled Meeting Wu Qiding, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, considers the stamp duty, tobacco, and alcohol tax to be one of the important sources of national revenue. Since taking office, he has repeatedly consolidated it, but so far it has not improved. Moreover, as of the end of March this year, only one or two of the ten or so provinces have been able to collect enough in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, and some have even reported only 30% to 40% of the amount collected. Therefore, in order to make every effort to make up for the shortfall, he specially requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to convene the heads of the stamp duty, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus of various provinces to come to Shanghai for a meeting to discuss concrete measures for consolidation. The meeting date is from 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month, and the meeting will last for two days, closing on the afternoon of the 21st. The meeting location is the conference hall of the department in the Jianghai Customs Building on Hankou Road.</p>
<p>Attending Directors The directors and deputy directors of the stamp duty, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus of the provinces designated to attend the meeting include: Jiangsu (Director) Sheng Shengyi, (Deputy) Xue Futian; Zhejiang (Director) Zhao Xi'en, (Deputy) Huang Zupei; Anhui (Director) Jing Lingxin; Hubei (Director) Li Rongkai, (Deputy) Yang Duo; Hunan (Director) Tang Yan, (Deputy) Yi Ding; Jiangxi (Director) Jing Youyan, (Deputy) Pan Linyan; Henan (Director) Qu Dacheng, (Deputy) Lu Tinggan; Fujian (Director) Wang Guanghui; Shandong (Director) Li Zongbi, (Deputy) Chuan Zhengshun; Hebei (Director) Liao Chungao, (Deputy) Xu Xian.</p>
<p>Scope of Discussion According to Mr. Chen, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Taxation Department, the department has seen a sharp decline in tobacco and alcohol tax revenue in recent years, and at a time when the national treasury is stretched and urgently needs funds, it is necessary to change course and make every effort to make up for the shortfall. This is why the meeting was convened. As for the scope of discussion, there is no specific agenda. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss how to consolidate in order to increase revenue. Therefore, after the directors of various regions arrive at the department, consultations will begin on the 20th. At that time, the provisional opinions of the directors will be adopted, and a concrete method will be jointly formulated, and then each will proceed according to the agreed method, and make every effort to consolidate.</p>

<h3>Rural Reconstruction Committee's Peng Xuepei Announces Self-Sufficiency Economic Policy: To Save the Current Crisis in the National Economy, We Can Only Strive to Catch Up on This Path</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Peng Xuepei, Director of the Secretariat of the Rural Reconstruction Committee, recently announced China's self-sufficiency economic policy on the Central Party Headquarters radio station. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency excerpted the main points as follows:</p>
<p>China was originally a country that could be self-sufficient, but because industry is underdeveloped, most manufactured goods are imported from foreign countries, and because of various reasons, a considerable portion of agricultural products are also imported from foreign countries, which has led to the current crisis in the national economy. To save this crisis, we can only strive to catch up on the path of self-sufficiency. If we adopt a self-sufficiency economic policy, there are several key points that must be noted: (1) We must set a step-by-step plan. It is impossible to achieve self-sufficiency in industrial products and agricultural products all at once. The development of industry cannot be achieved overnight. Only agriculture was originally developed in our country. Although we cannot apply science now, the sophistication of our country's farming methods and the richness of farmers' experience are still highly praised by Europeans and Americans today. If we start with agricultural products first, it is very easy to achieve self-sufficiency in agricultural products. But as long as agricultural products are self-sufficient, there will be no more excess of imports. (2) We must implement planned economy. In a world situation that is so unstable and an economic crisis that is so serious, laissez-faire economic policies are too late. If we want to see results quickly, we must use the power of the government to plan and control at the same time. The first step is to do a considerable amount of investigation and research. The second step is to use the power of the government to improve production. The third step is to use the power of the government to facilitate transportation and sales. These are all responsibilities that should be assumed by the government and done conscientiously, not left to nature. (3) Four parts industry and six parts agriculture. Some people say that China is a country based on agriculture. I don't understand what this sentence means. What is called a "country based on agriculture"? The meaning is extremely vague. It can also be interpreted as a factual issue, simply saying that 80% of China's current population relies on agriculture for food. This is a fact. It can also be interpreted as an ideal issue, saying that Chinese people should value agriculture and should take agriculture as an ideal occupation. This is very debatable. It can also be interpreted as a philosophical issue, talking about the national spirit and the rule of the former kings, and connecting China's ancient political system, philosophical thought, and entire culture to the word "agriculture." That is extremely mysterious. Therefore, it raises the question of whether we should base the country on industry. It is also difficult to define what is called a "country based on industry." It is undoubtedly necessary for China to develop industry, but with such a vast land and such a large population that has been engaged in agriculture for generations, agriculture will always occupy a very important position in China's national economy for a very long period of time. Therefore, valuing industry and not valuing agriculture is also impossible in fact. In Europe, some countries emphasize both agriculture and industry, such as France and Poland. It is said that, generally speaking, it is roughly four parts industry and six parts agriculture. Although this is also an extremely vague statement, from the perspective of a self-sufficiency economic policy, this is indeed the ideal economic state of China in the future. In other words, we hope that in the future, China's industrial products will be largely self-sufficient, and agricultural products will also be largely self-sufficient, and China is indeed qualified to hope to realize this in terms of natural conditions. (4) Industry and commerce should be dispersed throughout the country. The over-concentration of population in cities is a problem that all advanced countries are very concerned about. The disadvantage of cities is that everyone lives a dirty, cramped, and unsanitary life, and everyone is infected with the bad habits that are inevitably attached to cities. The advantage of rural areas is that they are not only beneficial to physical health but also cultivate the virtues of simplicity, honesty, and equality. The result of population concentration in cities is that the country loses the supply of most of its healthy population. Secondly, industry and commerce are concentrated in a very small number of cities. For example, the center of gravity of industry and commerce in our country is almost entirely in Shanghai. This is an extremely dangerous thing in terms of national defense. European countries have already discovered these disadvantages, but the die is cast and it is not easy to transform. When our country begins construction, we should have a new impression in mind and should open a new path. We should make full use of the land and human resources of various places, and make cities and agriculture complement each other and assist each other.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Literacy Education Committee has organized literacy education service groups to make up for the shortcomings of literacy schools. The details have been seen in previous reports. It is now heard that the committee has formulated guidelines for sub-group work for the purpose of clarifying the work of the sub-groups and facilitating their operation. The full text is appended below: (1) After receiving the letter of appointment from the general group (which has already been sent out earlier this week), the head of the sub-group should immediately fill out the form and send it to the general group within three days (the general group is located in the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee in the central district of the city, Zhengzhong Road). (2) After being appointed, the head of the sub-group should immediately recruit members in accordance with Article 5 of the service group charter. Any middle school students or primary school students in grades four, five, and six, or primary school students in grade two who are at least ten years old, can be recruited as members, and please pay attention to the one-fourth quota in Article 16 of the service group charter. (3) When recruiting members, the sub-group head should first or simultaneously look for several deputy heads and report them to the general group for appointment. (4) The recruitment of members for the sub-group should be completed before June 17th. (5) When the recruitment of members is completed, the members should be announced to join the group and a member swearing-in ceremony should be held. The oath is as follows: "I solemnly swear that I will obey the orders of the general group and the sub-group with utmost sincerity, teach people to read, and never be lazy or deceive others. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept punishment. (Name of sub-group in a certain school of the Shanghai Literacy Education Service Group, Signed: [Name], [Date])" (6) After the sub-group is established, a summary table should be filled out and sent to the general group and the Literacy Education Committee, the district office, and the district official. A list of addresses is attached and should be checked. (7) The work of members teaching people should officially begin on July 1st. Each member should teach at least [number of people], and the [number of characters] literacy textbook should be read within [number of months], or within [number of months] at the latest. (Although there is a summer vacation in July, the head of each sub-group and [member] should stay at school at least [number of days] per week to guide members' teaching and call together members, [or] train the public, or conduct testing. Summer vacation is a great opportunity for students to teach people and should not be missed. The sub-group leaders and deputy leaders must stay at school regularly to provide guidance, which is essential.) (8) The volunteer form in Article 10 of the service group charter has already been distributed to each sub-group. If it is not enough, each sub-group should print its own copies. (10) The table in Article 10 of the service group charter, namely the member's teaching diary form, has already been distributed to each sub-group. If it is not enough, it should also be printed by itself. (10) There are two types of literacy textbooks, one for adults and one for children, which are issued by the head of the sub-group to the district office of the Literacy Education Committee. (11) In Article 18 of the previously issued service group charter, the word "term" in the phrase "members in the term" is a mistake for "week". (12) The report procedure in Article 1 of the previously issued "Extra-Curricular Tutoring Measures" may be exempted due to the addition of Item [number] to Article [number] of the service group charter. However, if the district office believes that it is necessary for the volunteer to enter a literacy school after receiving the volunteer form forwarded by the sub-group, it may still order him or her to study at the school.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Expelled Overseas Chinese from Dutch East Indies Returning to China: 116 People Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai This Saturday</h3>
<p>Since the anti-Chinese campaign in the Dutch East Indies, a large number of overseas Chinese have been forced to leave the country. It is learned that another 116 refugee overseas Chinese who were forced to leave the country have now boarded the Dutch ship Zisadanni to return to China. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this Saturday. The overseas Chinese affairs agencies in the city will send personnel to the port to take care of them and discuss relief measures.</p>
<h3>Five Exchanges Appeal for Delay in Imposing Transaction Tax: Five Exchanges Appoint Du Yuesheng to Petition Kong in Person; Gold Industry Petition Delegation Requests Reduction in Tax Rate</h3>
<p>According to the Shiye News Agency, since the five exchanges in the city received the order from the Ministry of Finance to start collecting transaction tax on July 1st, they have all felt that business is sluggish and cannot bear the heavy burden. The group is in a state of panic. The directors of the five exchanges held a joint meeting the day before yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday, the Gold Industry Brokers Association also held a meeting and submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to approve a reduction in the tax rate in order to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting of the Directors of the Five Exchanges</p>
<p>The Federation of Five Exchanges convened a joint meeting of the directors of the five exchanges at the board room of the Cotton Exchange at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Du Yuesheng of the Gold Exchange, Mu Ouchu of the Cotton Exchange, Zhang Weiru of the Securities Exchange, Wang Yiting of the Flour Exchange, Gu Xinrong of the Grain Exchange, and Chu Qiaqing and other six people attended. After a close discussion for [number of hours] hours, the meeting adjourned. A reporter visited Mr. Mu Ouchu yesterday, who said that the content of the meeting was specifically to discuss ways to request the Ministry of Finance to take into account the difficulties of the merchants and approve a delay in the collection of the new tax, and there was no other discussion. Subsequently, according to inquiries made by the reporter to relevant parties, the directors of the five exchanges have resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance, and have appointed Du Yuesheng, the director of the Gold Exchange, as the plenipotentiary representative to personally visit Minister Kong with the petition within the next few days to plead for the matter.</p>
<p>Gold Industry Decides to Form a Petition Delegation</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange Brokers Association convened a general meeting of members at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 members, including Zhan Liansheng, Wang Jiafu, and Wang Yingchang, attended. After Chairman Zhan Liansheng reported the purpose of the meeting, the discussion began on how to request a reduction in the transaction tax scheduled to be collected by the Ministry of Finance. It was resolved to submit a request for a reduction as soon as possible in order to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. Chairman Zhan immediately read out the draft submitted to the Ministry of Finance and expressed that, in addition to submitting a request for a reduction, the entire petition delegation would be organized according to the resolution of the previous general meeting to petition Minister Kong. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Request for Approval of Reduction Submitted to the Ministry of Finance Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhan Liansheng, President of the Gold Industry Brokers Association, and Wang Jiafu, Vice President, submitted a document to Minister Kong yesterday, stating: "A document is hereby submitted requesting that the implementation of the transaction tax be delayed, as the circumstances of the association are special and adherence to the regulations would hinder business. We earnestly lay out our difficulties in the hope that you will grant us a reduction to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. The association has repeatedly submitted requests for a reduction on various grounds, and we believe that they have been thoroughly examined by your esteemed leadership, but we have not yet received a reply and are deeply apprehensive. Now we have received an order to start collecting the tax on July 1st, and we are shocked and horrified. We have found that the transactions of our association are different from those of other commodities. Gold transactions are related to international exchange rates, because most countries implement the gold standard. In order to avoid losses in settlement prices, merchants in our country who trade with foreign countries must first hedge in the exchange market. However, the exchange market changes rapidly, and the buying and selling of gold also changes frequently with changes in gold prices. The commission charged by our association is particularly low, which is also for a reason, so that the cost of hedging is reduced and facilitated. Now, the tax rate set by your ministry is, in terms of reasonable assessment, not too large, but other commodities have procedures for import and export, and there is no situation of import and export at the same time. Only gold hedging changes with market prices, and there are even cases of import and export several times in one transaction. Each time, the tax must be paid, which in effect is heavier than that of other commodities. Therefore, the gold transaction tax is already a heavy burden compared to the commission collected by the association. If the current tax rate is implemented, the business will inevitably decrease sharply, and the state tax revenue will not increase. This is the special circumstance of the association, and adherence to the regulations would hinder business. The association is not making specious arguments or hoping for unreasonable gains, but is sincerely considering the state treasury and the situation of the merchants, and must take both into consideration. In this time of commercial warfare and economic decline, foreign trade is always in a state of turmoil. The government has spared no effort in protecting and rescuing merchants, and all the people are deeply grateful. For this hedging mechanism that is related to international trade, there will surely be compassion and fulfillment. Therefore, we dare to lay out our innermost feelings and make a final request, hoping that you will grant us a reduction, which would be a great blessing for the overall situation and for the association."</p>

<h3>Danish Government Appoints Hill as Consul-General in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Copenhagen on the 11th, Hill, the counselor of the Danish Embassy in London, has now been appointed as the Consul-General in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Justice Approves the Provision of Security with Bonds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Justice to approve the issuance of a circular to all courts not to refuse to accept the provision of security with public treasury bonds by litigants, based on the request of the Shanghai Timber Industry Association. After the association submitted its request on the 28th of last month, it received a reply from the Ministry of Justice yesterday with approval number 1673, stating: "The content of the report is understood. The matters mentioned are indeed factual. With regard to applications for provisional seizure, when the court orders the provision of appropriate security, cash should be deposited or valuable securities deemed appropriate by the court should be substituted. According to the provisions of Paragraph 1 of Article 102 of the current Civil Procedure Law, the court has the right to exercise discretion. However, if the creditor provides reliable and valuable securities that have been converted into a corresponding amount at the current market price as security within the scope permitted by laws and regulations, the court may facilitate it. Furthermore, such cases of provisional seizure are often urgent and should be handled expeditiously to prevent the debtor from concealing assets. This matter has been ordered by the ministry to the Jiangsu High Court, the Second and Third Branches of the Jiangsu High Court, and the courts under their jurisdiction to comply with."</p>
<h3>National Economic Council Silk Improvement Committee Meeting Record</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the National Economic Council Silk Improvement Committee held its fifth standing committee meeting at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau at 3:00 PM tomorrow. Tan Xihong, Leng Mai, Wu Shenbo, He Shangping, Wan Jingzhong, and other six people attended, and Guo Dehua and other four people attended as observers. Because Commissioner Ren [name] Fu was summoned to Sichuan, the meeting was chaired by Tan Xihong, the acting director. The agenda was as follows: (1) Discussion of the budget for the 24th year; (2) Report on the outstanding achievements of the committee in assisting Sichuan, Shandong, Anhui, and Hubei provinces to improve the silk industry this year, with promising prospects; and (3) Discussions on technical and administrative matters.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Sends Personnel to Investigate Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association previously requested permission to exempt taxes on 50,000 piculs of foreign rice passports in the Ningbo area, which suffered from a severe drought, in order to prepare relief rice and stabilize prices for relief. However, due to the time required for procurement and the urgent need of the victims, it was resolved to first advocate the use of Ningbo rice merchants and entrust Zhuo Baoting of the Ningbo Taihe Rice Company to handle the matter nearby, and to establish a preparation office for relief rice at the Fifth District Administrative Inspectorate of Zhejiang Province to coordinate the overall work. Later, it was discovered that the broken Siamese rice received by the recipients of the subsidized rice in Yin and Feng counties was of poor quality, being stale, rotten, and moldy. Accusations arose, and the Tenth All-County Representative Assembly of Yin County believed that the rice merchants deliberately mixed in inferior rice and resolved to severely punish the person in charge, Zhuo Baoting, and requested the Yin County government to detain Zhuo Baoting. The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, upon hearing the news, believed that Mr. Zhuo was usually very enthusiastic about local public welfare and would not engage in private gain in this relief effort. It was suspected that he was taking the blame for others. It immediately telegraphed the Yin County government to restore Zhuo's freedom and dispatched Yan Boying, a member of the association, to Ningbo to investigate the matter and clarify the truth. It is now heard that 32 Ningbo rice merchants, including Fengtai, believe that the occurrence of the case is related to their business reputation and jointly sent a letter to the association yesterday to explain. The letter reads: "We respectfully report that Zhuo Baoting, the manager of our fellow merchant Taihe Rice Company, was entrusted by your association to handle the subsidized rice, but was accused by the Yin County Party Department of mixing in inferior rice and taking the opportunity to collect money because of the discovery of moisture, clumping, worms, and mold, and was ordered by the Yin County government to detain and punish him, and was not allowed to post bail. We are extremely grateful that your association sent letters and telegrams and was able to temporarily allow bail. However, the case has not been clarified, and not only is Mr. Zhuo's personal reputation at stake, but also the business credit of our fellow merchants has been swept away. The original plan was for 50,000 piculs of subsidized rice to be prepared at one time, but Mr. Zhuo believed that market prices were unpredictable, so only 16,500 piculs have been prepared so far. Considering the recent prices, if the full amount had been prepared, we do not know how much would have been lost. This can be used as proof of loyalty and diligence. As for the quality of the rice, there are often differences in the rice purchased from the same location at the same price. If we talk about moisture, clumping, worms, and mold, it may be due to moisture in the warehouse or due to weather conditions, which is an unavoidable fact. It is said that rice merchants work hard and get tired in April. Unexpectedly, we have been blamed by all parties. The party and government authorities have severely punished us. Mr. Zhuo's innocence is not important, but the lack of clarity is related to the reputation and credit of our fellow merchants. Therefore, we dare to take the liberty of submitting this report jointly, hoping that your association will send a special commissioner to Ningbo as soon as possible to investigate the matter together. The matter is important, and we hope that you will implement it quickly."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Notifies Various Businesses Regarding New Regulations for Import Duty Payment Certificates</h3>
<p>A person from the public sphere says, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to various trade associations in the city stating: "Regarding the matter that on the 7th of this month, we received letter No. 1450 from the Jianghai Customs, which stated: 'After examining the import duty payment, the forms have now been revised and will be implemented from the 10th of this month. This new type of import duty payment certificate will be filled out by the Customs according to the format and issued free of charge. Merchants do not need to fill it out themselves. The new import duty payment certificate should be submitted together with the import declaration form. After the Customs verifies and fills in the various tax items, four copies will be given to the merchants, who should take them to the Central Bank Tax Collection Office to pay the taxes according to the regulations. After paying the taxes, the merchants should return the first and second copies to the Customs as proof that the taxes have been paid. The import tax receipt will henceforth be issued by the Customs to the taxpayer for safekeeping. For goods subject to consolidated tax, after the above regulations are implemented, merchants must still fill out the consolidated tax payment certificate when preparing the import declaration form and submit it for verification. All merchants should be informed accordingly. This notice is hereby issued.' We are sending this letter to notify you to take note and act accordingly."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Court, Explaining That Delivery Notes Do Not Require Stamps</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, to explain the reason why delivery notes do not require stamps, wrote to the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court, stating: "Regarding the matter that on the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the Local Timber Trade Association stating that the Ruichang Timber Firm, a member of their association, had recently been investigated by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, who seized seven delivery notes last month. On the 7th of this month, they received Criminal Ruling No. 272, Series 24, from the Shanghai Local Court, sentencing them to a fine of 70 yuan. They requested assistance, etc. Having investigated the delivery notes, they only contain the dimensions and quantity of the goods and do not indicate any amount of money. They are issued for customers to check the quantity of goods. At the same time, there is also an invoice, and when receiving payment, there is also a tear-off slip and receipt, all of which have the required stamps affixed. There is no case of missing stamps. The court considers the delivery note as an invoice, which is due to a lack of understanding of the customs of the trade. In addition to Ruichang Firm filing a separate appeal against the ruling, we are sending this letter to convey the situation. We respectfully request that you consider the difficulties of the business community and carefully review the matter, sending a letter to the Local Court to make corrections according to the law. We would be extremely grateful." Two sample notes, each on a separate sheet, were enclosed with the letter. After examining the two sample notes, not only are the colors different, but the content recorded is also different. The latter type, which is called a delivery note, focuses on recording the dimensions and number of pieces and is like a quantity list attached to the invoice. This delivery note is sent along with the invoice when the goods are shipped. Therefore, there are definitely no two duplicate invoices for one shipment. This is also a common practice in the business world. Furthermore, on February 18th of the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance issued Directive No. 9822 to the Shaoxing Oil Trade Association, which stated that if the item slip is sent along with a stamped invoice, then the item slip can be exempt from stamps. This shows that for the convenience of merchants, a separate item slip is issued in addition to the invoice to assist with the process. Regardless of the name used, as long as the invoice has sufficient stamps affixed and is sent with the goods, the latter type of item slip no longer needs to have stamps affixed. This has been a long-standing precedent. We are sending this letter with the relevant information for your court's reference."</p>

<h3>Scarce Rainfall Causes Rice Prices to Rise Daily</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been very dry, with very little rainfall. Recently, rice prices have also been rising, causing considerable anxiety among the people. We have investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Farmers Hope for Rain Since the drought in the rice-producing areas last year caused a severe crop failure, people have been in a state of anxiety. This year, since the beginning of summer, the rice seedlings in the fields have been in dire need of rain, but the sky has not rained. In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, if there is no heavy rain, the early rice crop will be affected. Although there have been showers in the city in recent days, the area covered is very small. Therefore, the farmers in the various villages are all in a state of panic.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise According to the rice market in the city, even though there is a severe credit crunch, rice prices are still rising daily. Although they had fallen slightly a few days ago, they have recently exceeded 13.5 yuan. This is because the supply from the interior is scarce, and those who hoard rice are unwilling to sell it, resulting in a shortage of rice in the market and a daily increase in prices. If rainfall cannot be evenly distributed this year, the future of the people's food supply is worrying.</p>
<h3>Tongren Hospital Postpones Construction of New Building Due to Reorganization of Puyi Company</h3>
<p>According to Dr. 持支, Director of the Tongren Hospital on East-West Huade Road, speaking to a representative of the Shanghai Times, the plan to build a new building for the Tongren Hospital at the corner of Hede Road and Changping Road was nearing completion. However, due to the closure of the Meifeng Bank, it has had to be postponed indefinitely. The 700,000 yuan in donations for the construction of the new building are all held by the Puyi Real Estate Company. Even if they are not completely lost, it is unknown when they will be recovered. The land for the new building, measuring 11 mu, was purchased for 360,000 yuan. The construction cost is estimated to be 750,000 yuan. Only half of the land price has been paid. Although the Puyi Real Estate Company is being reorganized, it is involved with the Meifeng Bank and others. The liquidation of the Meifeng Bank and the reorganization of the Puyi Real Estate Company will take a long time to complete. Therefore, the plan to build the new building has had to be postponed indefinitely. When it is known how much of the 700,000 yuan can be recovered in the future, a meeting will be held to consider how to proceed. These 700,000 yuan were donated by Chinese and American individuals and organizations, including 200,000 yuan from the estate of the late philanthropist Li Side.</p>
<h3>Taicang Native Association Telegraphed the Provincial Government to Strictly Prohibit the Releasing of Lake Fields to Alleviate Lake Calamities and Relieve the People's Hardships</h3>
<p>The Taicang Native Association in Shanghai yesterday telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Construction Department, stating: "Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Shen, Director of the Construction Department, the water conservancy of the Three Wu regions is centered on Taihu Lake. In recent years, downstream counties have suffered frequent droughts and floods, which are attributed to the mismanagement of Taihu Lake. Furthermore, tenants along the river are competing to enclose the lake for farming, gradually reducing the lake's area. The lake water cannot be contained, and the ability to store floodwater is lost. Droughts will occur imminently. As a result, downstream counties, such as our Taicang, are directly affected. The ignorance of the common people in seeking profit is understandable. However, the Lake Field Clearance Office and the local county government not only fail to stop them but openly organize large-scale companies to pay for the right to reclaim land. They were deceived at the time and are now trying to cover up the matter. We do not know what their intentions are. The Lou River is an important channel for draining water from Taihu Lake and is also the center of water conservancy for all farmland in Taicang County. If the lake surface is occupied, the water source will gradually be blocked. Once droughts and floods occur, the 800,000 mu of farmland will be rendered unusable. This matter concerns the interests of the entire county. We have no choice but to jointly telegraph your office (department) to thoroughly investigate the facts, remove all enclosed lake fields and restore them to the lake, and strictly prohibit the release of lake fields in order to alleviate lake calamities and relieve the people's hardships. We await your urgent orders." Respectfully submitted by Hu Duanxing, Yang Zhihao, Lu Jingshi, Shen Boli, Jin Xiawen, Zhao Boying, He Yuanming, Zhu Jingan, Hong Jingping, Qian Weizong, Wu Yulin, Wu Shenyi, Qian Gongdu, Gong Minqiu, Shao Menggang, and others from the Shanghai Taicang Native Association.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xiangcheng was Suddenly Assassinated After Arriving in Shanghai from Ningbo in the Early Morning. He Knew Someone Was Plotting Against Him and Went to Ningbo and Shanghai to Temporarily Avoid Danger. He Was Shot and Killed by Two Thugs After Landing Yesterday Morning.</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiangsheng, a 21-year-old from Yuyao, Zhejiang, resided at No. 19, Baoqing Lane, No. 666, Tiantong Road. His father, Nuo Zengxuan, owned the Huichang Exchange Shop in Xingren Lane, Ningbo Road, with very rich assets. Xiangsheng was the only son. After his father passed away seven years ago, Xiangsheng was too young to continue his father's business. Therefore, his mother decided to close the shop. The estate was about 200,000 yuan. The year after his father's death, Xiangsheng was kidnapped and a huge ransom was demanded. His mother asked someone to negotiate with the kidnappers and reluctantly paid 30,000 yuan to redeem him. At the age of 18 and a half, his mother arranged for him to marry the daughter of Xie Shaogeng, a wealthy businessman from the same hometown. After the marriage, the couple had disagreements and divorced within a year, paying 8,000 to 9,000 yuan in alimony, spending a total of 70,000 yuan. His mother passed away in Shanghai after the January 28th Incident. All the estate was inherited by Xiangsheng alone. Recently, he became addicted to opium and did not work, living off his assets, which have been depleted by more than half. He has not remarried. He rents out part of his house in Shanghai to his cousin Chen Shuitang (over 30 years old, manager of the Hongchang Rice Shop at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Park Road). Last autumn, his family suffered misfortune again when they were robbed by bandits who stole several thousand yuan. Around the end of last year, Xiangsheng suddenly received bad news that someone wanted to plot against him. Therefore, from the first month of the lunar calendar this year until recently, he frequently traveled between Shanghai and Ningbo, with no fixed schedule, hoping to avoid danger. He always traveled on the Taikoo Steamship Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route on the new Beijing steamship. This time, he went to Ningbo on Monday of this week and took the new Beijing steamship from Ningbo to Shanghai on the 10th, staying in a first-class cabin, room number 12. After the ship arrived at the port at 5:30 a.m. on the 10th, Xiangsheng landed at about 6:00 a.m. and walked north along the Bund to hire a car to return home. Unexpectedly, when he walked to the sidewalk near the Company Wharf and the Shanghai Observatory on Yangjingbang, next to a cigarette booth, two thugs suddenly rushed up from behind, one wearing a gray long gown and the other wearing a blue long gown. The thug wearing the blue long gown took out a pistol and fired at Xiangsheng's back. With a loud bang, the bullet entered Xiangsheng's back and went straight through his chest near the left breast without exiting. Xiangsheng fell to the ground, and blood gushed out like a fountain, and he died instantly. At that time, there were few pedestrians on the road. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, quickly fled without a trace. The French Concession Maitland Police Station received the news and immediately sent a large number of detectives to apprehend them. However, it was too late, and the murderers had already fled far away. Therefore, they carried the body to the forensic examination office of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch and sent detectives to investigate the relatives of the deceased. At that time, the deceased's cousin Chen Shuitang, cousin Nuo Housheng (28 years old, living at No. 2, Lane 433, North Shansi Road, running a gold exchange business), and cousin Zhu Hongsheng (running an exchange business) had already arrived at the forensic examination office after hearing the news. Subsequently, the police station reported to the Special Second District Court Prosecutor's Office, which dispatched Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with Forensic Doctor Wei, Clerk Zhao, etc., to inspect the body at noon and remove the bullet. After the examination, they sat down at the desk. According to Detective Zhang Chunsheng's report on the investigation after the incident, the officials questioned the deceased's relatives, Zhu Housheng, Zhu Hongsheng, and Chen Shuitang, about the deceased's life. They ruled that Zhu Xiangsheng died from gunshot wounds sustained while alive. The body was handed over to the relatives Zhu Housheng and Zhu Hongsheng for burial. The bullet and a note were ordered to be investigated and then submitted to the case file. After the examination, according to the relatives, the deceased did not usually go out often. It is difficult to determine the reason for his sudden death. The French police planned to search the deceased's residence in the hope of obtaining clues to the murderers. They have also dispatched detectives to purchase leads and arrest the murderers. The remains of the deceased were approved by the family to be transported to the China Funeral Home for encoffining.</p>
<h3>Landlord on Haifang Road Voluntarily Reduces Rent. Rent is Reduced by 10% Starting This Month. All Tenants Were Notified Yesterday.</h3>
<p>Haifang Village, No. 410, Haifang Road in Western Shanghai, has 14 municipal houses and 65 residential houses. The municipal houses rent for 36 yuan per month. The residential houses are divided into three classes: first class rents for 45 yuan per month, second class rents for 40.5 yuan, and third class rents for 36 yuan. All are properties of the Foreign Refugee Relief and Charity Agency. The owner, in view of the recent economic downturn and poor business conditions, and deeply aware of the hardships of businesses and residents, has voluntarily reduced rent, deciding that starting this month (June), all houses will be rented at a 10% discount. All tenants were notified by letter yesterday.</p>
<h3>Robbers Open Fire, Wounding a Chinese Constable and an Apprentice. Three Robbers Fled, Two Were Captured.</h3>
<p>The Fusunxiang store, located at No. 138 Avenue Haig in the French Concession and owned by Li Shibin, specializes in various Western-style buttons. His family also resides in the store. Recently, there are spare rooms for rent, so there is a "Room for Rent" sign posted outside. At 10:20 a.m. yesterday, three robbers suddenly broke into the accounting room under the pretext of renting a room. One was wearing a Western suit and two were wearing light gray silk gowns. They showed pistols and threatened the staff not to make a sound. They searched for ten minutes. The store had no cash on hand and only snatched a gold ring from the hand of Li's wife, Wang. They took the stolen goods and fled west. Li Shibin was unwilling to let them go and chased them outside, shouting "Catch the robbers!" Two men on bicycles happened to pass by and chased after them. The robbers reached Rue Vilmont and, realizing that they were being chased, the robber with the gun took the preemptive measure of firing backwards to resist arrest. They then went west on Avenue Joffre and turned north onto Rue Lyautey and fled. Chinese Constable No. 68 from the police station heard the sound and knew that they were robbers. He caught up and fired back but was shot in the left leg by the robber's bullet. Chen De, an apprentice at the large pancake shop at No. 121 Avenue Joffre, was also wounded in the right leg by a stray bullet. When the robbers fled north along Rue Lyautey, Chinese Constable No. 40 and the Russian volunteer constables from the reserve team also joined the chase. They captured two robbers at Route Kaufmann and seized a pistol from one of the robbers. They took them to the police station for investigation. One robber escaped. The police station sent the wounded Constable No. 68 and the apprentice to the hospital for treatment. The captured robbers will be sent to the Special Second District Court for interrogation today.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Tramway Accused of Overcrowding. British Court Fines 60 Yuan.</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the Shanghai Tramway Company was recently found by the police to have violated the Public Works Department regulations by overcrowding its trams four times. The case was brought before the British Consular Police Court. Today (June 12), Judge Haynes opened the trial and said that although the company did not intentionally violate the regulations, the fact that the trams were overcrowded was confirmed. He sentenced the company to a fine of 15 yuan for each offense, totaling 60 yuan. The Chinese Public Bus Company was also accused of violating regulations four times by overcrowding its buses. The trial is scheduled to open next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Bronze Statue of Sun Yat-sen in Lanzhou to be Undertaken by Gansu Manufacturing Bureau, Cast by Zhang Chenbo and Yan Dehui</h3>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang visited Lanzhou last year and advocated the construction of a bronze statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, it was handed over to the Gansu Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government for handling. It is now heard that the bronze statue has been undertaken by the Gansu Manufacturing Bureau. The cost of making the statue is 7,500 yuan, and the total cost, including the stone platform, is more than 10,000 yuan. The complete drawings and models will be designed and cast by Zhang Chenbo, director of academic affairs at the Shanghai Art College, and Professor Yan Dehui of the sculpture department.</p>

<p>Since the case of six family members, including the elderly and young, men and women, jumping to their deaths from the top of the tower at the entrance of the Great World Amusement Park in the French Concession a few days ago, investigators have been secretly dispatched to each floor to patrol the area. Yesterday (i.e., June 12), at around 2:00 p.m., a man wearing a shirt, black silk trousers, and a drunken look with bloodshot eyes was at the broadcasting station on the sixth floor, intending to jump to his death. The investigators discovered him and pulled him into the accounting room. According to the man, his name is Yang Zuyin, 24 years old, from Yuyao. Six or seven years ago, he was involved in the morphine and red pill business. Now, he has been unemployed for a long time and has no way to make a living. Therefore, he has the idea of giving up on life. Today, for lunch, he specially bought 240 wen of Kaoliang liquor and drank it all in one go, intending to commit suicide. He has a younger brother named Yang Zude, who is now a clerk at a drugstore on Da Tong Road. The accounting room informed the French Police by telephone and sent detectives to take Yang to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Landlord Assaults Tenant for Not Returning Usurious Loan. Tenant Suffers Serious Internal Injuries.</h3>
<p>Shi A'gen, a native of Yangzhou residing at No. 11, Lane 220, Meizhou Road, recently borrowed 10 yuan of usurious loan from someone, guaranteed by Xu Jintao, a local landlord. He had not yet repaid the loan. At 6:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, he moved his family elsewhere. Xu refused and started an argument. He and his son, Xu Haogen, and wife beat Shi violently, causing serious injuries. His sister, Qiu Shi, reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched Detective Liu Changgen and Chinese Constable No. 2494 to arrest them. Xu Jintao and his wife escaped without a trace. They arrested his son, Xu Haoliang, and took him to the police station for detention. The injured was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the Xu was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Mr. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated the situation and said that the victim was seriously injured in the hospital because the defendant and his parents held Shi's hands and feet and threw him to the ground (commonly known as "pai san he tu"), causing internal injuries. He was unable to appear in court to testify and requested a postponement. He submitted the hospital injury report for inspection. According to his sister, Qiu Shi, her brother (i.e., the injured) only owed eight jiao of the usurious loan and should not have been beaten so severely. When questioned, the defendant stammered and denied the assault, asking for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ruled to remand him in custody and examine him again after the victim's injury recovered.</p>
<h3>The First Branch of the First District Municipal Union Urges a Rent Reduction Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Citizen's First District Branch Nanjing Road Commercial Union issued a declaration urging rent reduction for its member stores, stating: "In recent years, the commercial market has been in a state of depression and has reached its extreme. The sound of bankruptcies and liquidations is heard from time to time. Nanjing Road in Shanghai, which has always been known as prosperous, has seen its stores' business decline daily. The future is deeply feared. Without seeking salvation, how can we survive? The causes of today's market decline are not just one. While the method of salvation is best focused on addressing the root cause, this cannot be achieved overnight. It requires the unified planning of the upper and lower levels of society to be effective. Now, the urgent task is to treat the symptoms, which is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenses. However, the increase in revenue for businesses, that is, the increase in customers' purchasing power, has already become an irreversible fact. Therefore, we have to retreat and seek a plan to reduce expenses. According to general merchants, the largest monthly expenditure is rent, especially for stores on Nanjing Road, which account for more than 60% of the total expenses. In the past, during prosperous times, it was still possible to barely support it. In these times of decline in all industries, it is really unbearable. Some even find that their annual hard work is not enough to pay their rent. There are even those who are sued for rent arrears or go bankrupt as a result. Now, in order to save businesses and adjust the market, the first priority is to reduce rent to slightly ease the difficulties of businesses. The prosperity of the market is directly proportional to the increase in land and housing prices, and the decline of the market is directly proportional to the reduction in land and housing prices. The ownership of land and housing belongs to the owners, but it is the stores rented by tenants that cause the price to increase. Now, the tenants cannot bear the high prices of the past. Consider reducing and exempting rent to slightly alleviate the difficulties of the tenants and gradually restore the market. This is actually to alleviate the difficulties faced by the landlords themselves. After all, the financial resources of landlords are stronger than those of tenants who rent houses, and they can turn around more easily. Reducing and exempting a certain percentage of rent is not as difficult for them to cope with as it is for tenants. To put it bluntly, if you are greedy in the present and unwilling to sacrifice, it will make the merchants unable to support themselves and eventually lead to closure. The prosperous streets will surely become a tragic scene with ten houses empty. The landlords' losses will be several times greater than today and will eventually lead to mutual destruction. Therefore, some enlightened landlords have already voluntarily reduced rent or allowed the tenants' requests and implemented it. However, we have rarely heard of it on Nanjing Road. Moreover, the rent standards are very uneven. The same building has different rental prices depending on the person. The amount for the same house differs by several times. Therefore, we should appeal to the landlords on Nanjing Road to quickly broaden their horizons, implement rent reductions, and strive to overcome this unprecedented difficult situation together and achieve a state of coexistence and co-prosperity. Then, recovery is hopeful, and social prosperity is mutually beneficial, not only for the tenants. We hereby declare this, hoping that you will all take note of it."</p>
<h3>Preparatory Office for the Establishment of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Holds Founders' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Provisional Preparatory Office for the Establishment of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall by Various Circles in Shanghai issued the Sixth Notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of this notice, the preparatory work of this office has been underway for nearly half a year, and all matters are now roughly in order. However, there are several major issues that urgently need to be resolved by all colleagues (such as organizing the preparatory committee, etc.). Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Fundraising Regulations, we have specially scheduled the First Founders' (including founding organizations) Meeting to be held at 2:00 p.m. on June 23 (Sunday) in the auditorium on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road to discuss the specific implementation plan. Tea and refreshments will be provided on that day. Representatives from party and government agencies are invited to attend and provide guidance. At the same time, a special publication will be printed to report in detail on all the activities of this office in order to promote them. Regarding attendance at the meeting, the following methods are roughly formulated: (1) Founding organizations: Each organization should send a responsible representative to attend, with written proof from the organization, to be sent to this office with the representative's name by the 20th of this month in order to show respect. (2) Founders should attend in person in principle, but if they are unable to attend due to circumstances, they may also appoint a representative to attend in accordance with the previous article. (3) This office will make "admission tickets," which will be sent separately to each attending representative at the time for reception. The above methods are for your attention. If you have any proposals, please submit them in writing to this office by the 18th of this month for inclusion in the special publication and for discussion. We hope that you will attend enthusiastically at the time to jointly plan the progress. In addition to sending separate invitations and newspaper advertisements, this notice is specially issued. Furthermore, since this office has accepted Mayor Wu's opinion and decided to convert the bronze statue into a memorial hall, and has received affirmative replies from a majority of the founders, the name of this office should be changed to reflect the facts, and the words "Bronze Statue" should be deleted and its name corrected as follows: "Provisional Preparatory Office for the Establishment of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall by Various Circles in Shanghai" This is stated in conjunction.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed President of the District Court, Luo Tong, Held Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Luo Tong, the newly appointed president of the Shanghai District Court, was scheduled to be sworn in on the 12th of this month, as previously reported. Yesterday marked the date. At 9:00 AM, guests arrived one after another. Subsequently, the Jiangsu High Court appointed Shen Yuanshan, the presiding judge of the Civil Division of the High Court, to come to Shanghai by car to supervise the oath-taking ceremony. President Luo, along with Pang Shurong, the presiding judge of the Civil Division, and Secretary Wang Xun, greeted them separately. Representatives from various agencies attended, including Zheng Yue, the chief prosecutor of the High Court Branch, Liang Renjie, the president of the High Court Third Branch, Zhao Shibei, the chief prosecutor of the High Court Third Branch, Guo Yun Guan, the president of the First Special District Court, Xiang Youjun, the chief prosecutor of the First Special District Court, Si Mo, the president of the Second Special District Court, Chen San, the chief prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, Hu Renqing, the warden of the Third Prison, and Sun Kui Fang, the director of the Forensic Research Institute. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, Pan Zhongjia, the magistrate of Shanghai County, Cai Jinjun, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, Xu Yuyin, the chief of the County Public Security Bureau, Deng Peiyi and Chen Shijun from the Security Department, Mao Yun from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Shen Junru from the Lawyers' Association, lawyers Yi Shizhao, Jiang Ping, Zhan Jifeng, Shan Yuhua, and prominent businessmen Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and over fifty others first went to the reception room upstairs for tea and refreshments. At ten o'clock, a bell rang, and the oath-taking ceremony began. President Luo, accompanied by the guests, went to the First Court. Zhong Shangbin, the chief prosecutor of the District Court, also attended the ceremony. Judicial police chief Zhang Shuping, deputy chief Chen Xihui, and police officers Liu Fu and Gu Hanqing supervised all the bailiffs to maintain order around the hall. The oath supervisor took the chairman's seat, the oath-takers took their positions, and everyone stood in solemn silence. The Party song was sung, the highest respect was paid to the Party and national flag, and three bows were performed. The chairman read the Premier's will, followed by three minutes of silence. The oath supervisor delivered an instruction, followed by speeches from the guests and a response from the oath-taker. After the ceremony, photographs were taken. The oath-taker's oath was as follows: "I, Yu Jing, swear that I will恪遵 (kè zūn - respectfully abide by) the Premier's will, obey the Party's principles, abide by national laws, be loyal and diligent in my duties, and be frugal in expenses. I will never employ useless personnel, engage in corruption or bribery. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the Party's most severe punishment. This oath." Shen Yuanshan, the commissioner from Jiangsu High Court, stated in his address: "Our country has advocated judicial independence for more than twenty years. The new-style courts that have been established are gradually taking shape and achieving remarkable results. Shanghai, formerly under the jurisdiction of Songjiang, was偏 (piān - secluded) in a corner. Now it is a large port where people from all directions杂处 (záchǔ - mingle). The social situation is inevitably changing rapidly, and the methods of litigation inevitably involve various tricks. The District Court handles civil and criminal cases and bears a great responsibility. Therefore, the Ministry has selected President Luo to lead this court, naturally to choose the right person for the job and to promote improvement. Now that the oath-taking ceremony is being held, I will briefly mention the matters that should be noted. Judicial officials place great importance on integrity. In the past, Yang Zhen's 'Four Knows' were taken as the golden rule by those who were determined to be廉洁 (liánjié - incorruptible). Moreover, in the courtroom, we advocate the rule of law; how can we ignore this? This is one. The dignity of a judge is related to the public's outlook. The slightest carelessness in behavior is enough to bring about criticism. It must be known that judges are entrusted with the lives and property of the people. Even if they abide by the law and perform their duties honestly, they are still afraid of overlooking something. If they are unbridled, they will be guilty. When they reflect on themselves in the quiet of the night, how can they deal with themselves? This is two. The main point of judgment is nothing more than upholding impartiality. Regardless of how evidence is collected or how laws are applied, we must strive for衡 (héng - balance) between human feelings and reason, with impartiality and not allowing the guilty to escape being our goal. This is three. Accumulation of lawsuits, whether civil or criminal, is enough to harm the people. Although sometimes they are restrained by procedures, we should strive to proceed quickly and尽 (jìn - fulfill) our duties. This is four. Judicial organs are most concerned about preventing the asking for favors and the beginning of extortion. In the past, petty officials, clerks, or runners, either because their income was insufficient,罗织 (luózī - fabricated) and陷 (xiàn - framed), or because they were not sufficiently润笔 (rùnbǐ - bribed),蒙蔽 (méngbì - concealed) and delayed. All of these have been criticized by the world. In order to prevent微 (wēi - the slightest hint of evil) before it arises, all the officials, police, and丁役 (dīngyì - servants) of the court must be strictly investigated at all times by officials to prevent them from extorting under the guise of various excuses. Many evils will arise. Not only that, but all judicial administrative affairs are closely related to the handling of cases. If one can work tirelessly and in an orderly manner, the results will be seen more quickly. This is five. The above points have either been seen in brilliant ministerial orders or are the圭臬 (guīniè - standards) that judicial officials should adhere to. As the head of the organization,督 (dū - supervise) colleagues and pay attention to it at all times, so that they do not become lazy over time. President Luo is talented and determined not to be afraid of difficulties, not to be苟 (gǒu - perfunctory), and to整頓 (zhěngdùn - rectify) with the aim of people's happiness," and so on. Next, Mao Yun, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech. Shen Junru then stated that the position of the judiciary is important, and it is necessary to distinguish between public and private matters and work hard. Wang Xiaolai then spoke, saying that the movement to publicize unjust imprisonments has recently been launched, and he hopes that all judges will work hard and conscientiously. Finally, after Zhang Shizhao finished his speech, the conclusion was announced.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Organize a Telephone Committee and Hire Expert Brown</h3>
<p>Yesterday (Wednesday) was the date for the regular meeting of the board of directors of the Public Concession工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council). Among the items listed on the agenda, the telephone issue was one of them. The chairman first announced that the French Concession工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council) had previously sent a letter to this council regarding the organization of a special telephone committee. The French Concession authorities do not intend to formally send personnel to participate, but they intend to send one observer to attend and listen. This is because the局 (jú - council) intends to hire an expert to engage in a financial study of the telephone issue. The Shanghai Telephone Company has also expressed its agreement with the French工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council)'s proposal. In view of this, the chairman suggested that the special committee be composed of about four to five people, including one each from China, Japan, England, and the United States, or one person elected from residents of other nationalities to participate. This proposal was immediately approved by the entire board of directors, and it was decided that the names of the committee members would be formally submitted at the next regular meeting. The chairman then reported that the工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council) had previously telegraphed the British Post Office, asking the authorities to transfer a telephone expert to Shanghai to assist in telephone matters. The British Post Office has now replied in agreement and has recommended Major Brown, the current deputy chief engineer of the British Post Office, as suitable for this position. Mr. Brown has extensive experience in telephone issues and has made many contributions to the construction and maintenance costs of the British telephone industry. He has also personally participated in the revision of British telephone rates, so he is quite suitable for Shanghai's current needs. Mr. Brown will soon retire from the British Post Office and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early September. After the chairman's report, all directors unanimously decided to reply by telegram to hire Mr. Brown and urge him to travel as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Customs Seizes Smuggled Artificial Silk; Japanese Consulate to Negotiate with Customs</h3>
<p>The 大美晚報 (Dà Měi Wǎnbào - Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury) reports that the Chinese Customs巡船 (xúnchuán - patrol boat) "Guanwei" (关卫号) recently seized a Japanese汽油船 (qìyóuchuán - motorboat) at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The ship was carrying artificial silk worth 100,000 yuan. According to regulations, the ship and cargo should be confiscated. However, the captain of the巡船 (xúnchuán - patrol boat), Mr. White格 (gé - ge), has submitted an affidavit to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, stating that he wrote in the ship's log that the Japanese汽油船 (qìyóuchuán - motorboat) was detained not in Chinese territorial waters but in international waters five miles east of Amherst Rock. It is expected that the Japanese authorities will demand the return of the ship and cargo from the Chinese Customs based on this affidavit. According to Mr. White格 (gé - ge), who spoke to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury today (the tenth), he has resigned from the海关 (hǎiguān - customs) and said he issued the affidavit because海关 (hǎiguān - customs) refused to give him one-tenth of the value of the seized artificial silk as a reward, and instead planned to split it with the captain of a nearby ship that provided his patrol boat with gasoline on that day. He felt that this treatment was unfair, so he was angry and gave the statement. The 大美晚報 (Dà Měi Wǎnbào - Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury) reporter also inquired at the Japanese Consulate, which confirmed that it had Mr. White格 (gé - ge)'s affidavit but did not want to reveal how it would use it. It is also reported that the Japanese Consul has already begun to negotiate with the海关 (hǎiguān - customs) about this matter.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's One-Year Report on Rickshaw Management</h3>
<p>The Public Concession工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council)'s rickshaw management office's report for the month of May has been submitted to the board of directors for approval. The report includes a summary of the results since the office was established and a detailed statement on the improvements in rickshaw affairs in the Public Concession. The main points are as follows: The registration of rickshaw owners has been effective. The names and addresses of the big and small句头 (jùtóu - rickshaw gang leaders) have also been recorded. Since the implementation of the revised rickshaw rental regulations approved by the工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council) board of directors, the average number of times per month that rickshaw pullers rent (承租) cars is fifteen. In addition to enjoying the various benefits of the mutual aid society, their monthly income has increased by more than several yuan compared to last year.</p>
<p>The total number of registered public rickshaw pullers was 32,015 at the end of May. Private rickshaw pullers have also been registered and are required to wear armbands. Price lists have been affixed to all public rickshaws in prominent locations, with separate payment methods for calculating prices by time and distance.</p>
<p>The rickshaw management office has new-style rickshaws on display, which are greatly improved compared to the old-style rickshaws. The lighting equipment is also good, and the cost is far less than one hundred yuan. The detailed structural drawings can be obtained from the office.</p>
<p>The inspection of ordinary rickshaws is stricter than before, and the police are continuing to crack down on the illegal operation of "野鷄 (yějī - unregulated)"包車 (bāochē - chartered) rickshaws.</p>
<p>The above measures have been informally discussed with the neighboring authorities by the工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council) personnel, and the officials are expected to cooperate.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Postpones Redemption of Public Bonds This Year</h3>
<p>Regarding the redemption of the Shanghai Public Concession工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council) six-percent public bonds issued in 1925, the board of directors has decided to postpone the automatic redemption of the bonds for this year. These bonds were issued in 1925 with a total value of 5.6 million taels, and the redemption period was to begin after ten years and end after thirty years. The first self-determined redemption period was December 31 of this year. However, when the director of the Finance Department submitted the tenth-year financial report and the budget proposal for this year at a meeting of the Finance Committee of the工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council) on April 2, he proposed that the bonds scheduled to be redeemed this year be postponed. After repeated discussions by the Finance Committee, this matter was reported to the board of directors, which approved the proposal yesterday.</p>
<h3>Overseas Affairs Committee Member Ye Shaozhen Passed Away in Shanghai the Other Day</h3>
<p>Ye Shaozhen, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, passed away at his residence in Shanghai the other day (the 11th) due to overwork and illness. Chen Shuren, the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee in Nanjing, was saddened by the news and telegraphed Jian Jinglun, the director of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, to represent him in the memorial service. It is also learned that Mr. Ye's funeral will be held at 9:00 AM on the 13th at the Chinese Funeral Home.</p>
<p>###枇杷 (Pípá - Loquat) Merchants Negotiate with the Fruit Trade Association</p>
<p>Tangxi, Zhejiang, is a large town near the provincial capital of Hangzhou. In addition to rice and silk, farmers rely on 白沙 (Báishā - White Sand)枇杷 (pípá - loquats) as their main source of income. The fresh and sweet quality of these loquats is unparalleled elsewhere. Every harvest season, Tangxi枇杷 (pípá - loquat) merchants mainly transport their goods to the Sixteen Pu fruit market in this city. According to these merchants, the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar is the peak season for the sale of these枇杷 (pípá - loquats). Therefore, according to custom, each merchant ships their goods to Shanghai to meet the needs of the wholesalers. Normally, the pre-festival sales price would increase, and the profits would be used to offset the price drops after the festival. This year, over sixty merchant ships fully loaded with枇杷 (pípá - loquats) arrived in Shanghai to meet the market demand. However, when the ships arrived at the Sixteen Pu码头 (mǎtou - wharf), they were suddenly affected by the labor dispute between the fruit trade wholesalers and the栈司 (zhànsī - warehouse staff), causing the large quantities of枇杷 (pípá - loquats) to be delayed and sold after the festival, resulting in a loss of approximately ten thousand yuan. The merchants suffered a heavy loss. That evening, the sixty-plus merchant ships held an emergency meeting in a certain place in Nanshi and unanimously resolved that the extreme conflict between the fruit and vegetable industry and the warehouse staff disregarded the sale of the merchants' goods, causing huge losses. However, the warehouse staff were laborers and had no transaction relationship with the merchants, while the wholesalers and merchants had a deep-seated relationship based on years of transactions. Therefore, it was decided that compensation for this loss should be requested from the Fruit Trade Association. Wang Fuqing and Lu Lantian were appointed as representatives to negotiate with the association the other day, but no satisfactory result was achieved. It is now reported that the merchants will petition the Party and government authorities in the near future for assistance.</p>
<h3>Women's Production Cooperative Grand Sale, Women Actively Participate</h3>
<p>The Women's Temperance Society at 206 Yuanyuanmingyuan Road will hold a women's production cooperative exhibition on the 15th of this month.

As for the old goods department, all items are participating in the exhibition and sale at the lowest prices. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Texaco Oil Depot Strike</h3>
<p>The Texaco oil depot in Gaoqiao, Pudong, has more than two hundred workers. The relationship between labor and management is still harmonious. Unexpectedly, the depot authorities recently dismissed two workers. The labor side strongly opposed this dismissal because the two workers did not have any faults. Negotiations with the management were ineffective. Yesterday morning, all workers went on strike. The Gaoqiao Public Security Branch was informed and, fearing unexpected incidents, urgently dispatched several officers to suppress the situation and reported it to their superiors for review. The issue had not been resolved by late evening.</p>
<h3>China-West Commodity Market Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>Since the China-West Commodity Trade Market at the original site of the New World on Xizang Road began soliciting participants, many domestic manufacturers have actively participated. It is now reported that the market is scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. In recent days, manufacturers have been rushing to decorate their displays. Because the Municipal Government Health Exhibition will also be held at the market and European and American manufacturers will also participate, the displays are all competing for novelty and beauty. It is reported that there are still vacancies in the Chinese department of the market. Domestic manufacturers who want to participate will find it an excellent opportunity to promote sales and can contact the market office directly.</p>
<h3>Concubine of Ma Hongkui Sues to Establish Status; Trial Concludes; Judgment Scheduled for 17th</h3>
<p>After the late Ma Fuqi, the father of human rights activist Ma Hongkui, and his widow's eldest daughter-in-law, Ma Chen (the wife of Ma Hongkui), became involved in a will dispute with her brother-in-law, Ma Honggen, and his concubine, Ma Shi, a woman named Qin from Nanjing, along with her son Lushan, claimed to be Ma Hongkui's concubine and hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting Ma Chen and her children, Luzhen and Luying, to confirm her status. The trial, which has been opened and witnessed by Judge Tu Shenjie, has been reported in this newspaper many times. The court convened again yesterday at Civil Division 7 under Judge Tu. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The court also summoned Ma Honggen to testify. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that Song Defu recently sent a letter to his lawyer, claiming that he knew the inside story of the Ma family and, after learning of the lawsuit between Qin and Chen, he was willing to testify. Mr. Song was listening in the courtroom and requested the court to call him to testify. The judge approved and ordered Song to be called to the stand. According to Song, he and the Ma family were relatives, but due to the difference in wealth, he felt ashamed to associate with them, so they became estranged. However, he was sure that Qin was Hongkui's concubine. When Hongkui and Qin lived together, he often went to their home. The defendant strongly denied that the obituary submitted by the plaintiff was forged, and he was also aware of this. When Ma Fuqi passed away, the printed obituary included the childhood names of Hongkui's children, such as Baigou and Anan. Later, Wang Jianzhong, a friend of Ma, who was an official in the military headquarters, believed that the position of the Ma family was no longer what it used to be, and it would be embarrassing to include such inelegant childhood names in the obituary. Therefore, he advised the family to reprint it. At that time, the Ma family felt that it was necessary to replace and reprint the obituary. The previous one was destroyed, and the names of Baigou and others were changed to Lusheng and Luying before being published. At this point, the court asked Ma Honggen if he knew Ma Qin and her son. He replied, "I don't know." When asked how the obituary was printed at that time, he replied, "I don't know. I was living abroad at the time." When asked if Ma Qin had come to the funeral, he replied, "I don't know. We were in the mourning hall at the time and could not see them." After legal arguments by both sides, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the judgment for the afternoon of the 17th.</p>
<h3>Aviation Amusement Fair Scheduled to Be Held; Corps Leaders Enthusiastically Submit Membership Fees and Donations</h3>

<h3>Fire at the Dakang Silk Store on Guangxi Road</h3>
<p>The Dakang Silk Store at 132-136 Guangxi Road in the Public Concession, which has a grand three-bay storefront and is doing good business, unfortunately caught fire at around 3:50 AM yesterday morning. Thick smoke immediately poured out of the roof. The Central Fire Brigade was alerted and immediately dispatched pump trucks. Although the firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire, the flames were too strong and difficult to extinguish. It was not extinguished until 6:00 AM at dawn. Three buildings were destroyed, and the loss of silk and other property inside was substantial.</p>
<h3>Tang Jinbao Used Counterfeit Coins at Fish Stall; Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Tang Jinbao from Huzhou went to the Hongkou vegetable market at 7:30 AM on the 1st of this month and used a counterfeit silver yuan to buy fish worth 180文 (wén - copper coins) from Xin Fangcai, a Ningbo fishmonger, asking for change. Xin did not notice at the time and was fooled. Only later did he realize what had happened. The other day at 9:00 AM, Tang went to the same market again, attempting to use counterfeit coins at other vegetable stalls. He was spotted by Xin and handed over to Chinese Constable No. 420. Two identical silver coins were found on him. He was taken to the Hongkou police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Division 3 of the First Special Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the工部局 (Gōngbùjú - Municipal Council) stated that the defendant claimed at the police station that he got the counterfeit coins from his friend Zeng Fu at the tea house No. 335 Guangfu Road in Zhabei. The police sent detectives to investigate. According to the owner of the tea house, Yun, there was no such person as Zeng Fu and he did not know the defendant.

<h3>Husband Has Inveterate Habits, Making It Difficult to Be a Wife; Bitterly Persuaded to Quit but Suffered Abuse; Insufficient Living Expenses, Sues for Alimony</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiangcai, the owner of the Zhou Heng gold plating shop on Rue Ma, married a woman named Ye Mei from his hometown. They have been married for ten years and have two daughters, but the elder one died young and the younger one is still in diapers. In recent years, Zhou suddenly became addicted to opium and indulged in its pleasures all day long. Seeing that her husband was壮年 (zhuàngnián - in the prime of his life), Ye felt he should not indulge in such habits and repeatedly劝诫 (quànjiè - urged and advised) him to quit. However, the unwelcome words angered Xiangcai, and his treatment of her gradually became harsh. Moreover, her mother-in-law doted on her son and abused Ye even more. Ye suffered insults from her husband and was not tolerated by her mother-in-law, so she temporarily returned to her parents' home. Later, through mediation by relatives and friends, she lived at 27 Yihe Lane, Huaji Road, with Zhou providing her with 30 yuan per month for living expenses. Unexpectedly, after only two months, Zhou became stingy and stopped paying. Therefore, Ye has now hired lawyer Su Bingxing to file a lawsuit against Zhou Xiangcai, requesting a judgment ordering them to live together and to pay alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng opened the trial and will convene again for a retrial at a later date.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Grass Tennis League: Shanghai Lost to French Business, Only Won Two Groups, Result Six to Nine, French Business Association as Strong as Last Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tennis Club played against the French Business Association in the grass tennis league at the French Business Association yesterday. The You Team is the strongest in this year's league. The match between Lin Binhua and Qiu Feihai against Defu and Peng Weiqi can be called the strongest two groups in Shanghai.

Lin Baohua is still in a normal period, with many wonderful hits. Defu's ball is as crisp as ever. Peng Weiqi is as usual. In the first set, Lin Qiu lost with a score of 3 to 6, and then carefully responded to the challenge, and finally won two consecutive sets. The French Business Association's second group, Bai Lunshi and Ke Erqiao, are extraordinarily fierce. The Xu and Chen duo of the Shanghai Club were not their opponents. It was not easy to win one set. The third group also lost by a score of 1 to 2. The fourth group, Zhang Dingzhao and Zhou Guanjun of the Shanghai Club, are famous "sticky candies". They could have won three straight, but because the other groups had already finished, they had no intention of fighting. After 6 to 6, they lost two consecutive games and lost the third set with a score of 6 to 8. In the previous set, they won with scores of 6 to 3 and 6 to 2. The fifth group of French Business won three straight, which was also the fatal blow to the Shanghai Club.</p>

<h3>Municipal National Arts Hall Sets Up Obligatory Teaching</h3>

Since its opening, the results have been remarkable. However, because Shanghai is vast and the population is large, if additional venues are not established, those who are interested will always sigh with regret. Now, two more classes have been specially expanded, one in the gymnasium of the Booth School at the intersection of East Xihua Road and Zhaofeng Road, and the other in the large playground of Shanghai Middle School on Jiaozhou Road in West Shanghai, named the East District and West District Obligatory National Arts Class.

<h3>Ministry of Education Supervisor Zhong Inspects and Reports on Vocational Education in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>Supervisor and Section Chief of the Ministry of Education, Zhong Daozan, reported on the vocational education in Shanxi Province as follows: Vocational education in the province has always been very rudimentary. Since the proposal to expand it in the 23rd year (of the Republic), after completely transforming the attached secondary schools of the six normal schools, women's normal schools, national normal schools, and agricultural and industrial specialized schools into vocational schools or departments, there has been gradual improvement. Currently, there are three provincial-level junior agricultural vocational schools in Changzhi, Yuncheng, and Shuoxian; the provincial Yuncheng prison affairs junior vocational school; the provincial Daiyue animal husbandry junior vocational school; and two junior vocational departments of electrification and chemistry attached to the National Normal School. Besides these, there are very few county-run or private vocational schools. Among the aforementioned schools, the three agricultural vocational schools are poorly managed and urgently need improvement. The animal husbandry vocational school is performing relatively well, and the electrification and chemistry departments have very good methods. In recent years, the province has been focusing on economic construction and making every effort. The more than twenty production agencies under the Northwest Industrial Corporation are the driving force behind all of its construction. It should strive for close cooperation between construction and education, basing it on the needs of reality and as a foundation for cultivating talent. Considering the state of vocational education in the province, the following key points should be noted in the future:</p>
<p>1.  Provide subsidies to Shanxi students graduating from universities or colleges outside the province to serve as faculty in vocational schools in the province. After graduation, the department should consult with the original school to allow them to stay at the school as assistants or interns in factories or farms, or introduce them to other relevant institutions for one or two years of practice to increase their skills and experience. All expenses should be appropriately provided by the department.</p>
<p>2.  The transformation of national normal schools into vocational schools has recently begun to be realized. The first two junior vocational departments of electrical installation and repair and simple chemistry are being established, attached to the Yucai Machine Factory and the Match Factory. All managers and instructors are concurrently factory directors and technicians from each factory. The method is very good. However, the school still has surplus class funds for this year, and next year there will be an additional three class funds. It should make full use of the province's various production institutions to train various mid-level technicians in the Northwest Ten-Year Economic Construction Plan, as needed.</p>
<p>3.  The electrification and chemistry departments of the National Normal School currently graduate in two years, focusing on technology and factory experience. If the management is effective, it can be extended for two years to add advanced courses. In the latter two years, attention should be paid to academic theory to seek further study and to improve the industry.</p>
<p>4.  After the National Normal School is transformed into various vocational schools, it should unite with the responsible personnel of cooperative organizations to form a teaching, training, and research committee, chaired by the principal, as a guiding mechanism for all facilities. It must eliminate the accumulated malpractices of the old-style apprenticeship system, implement economically effective management methods, and not only adapt to the factory environment and develop work habits as the only purpose.</p>
<p>5.  In addition to cooperating as much as possible with the province's original industries and production institutions, the National Normal School should select some departments that are simple to equip and where talent can be recruited according to the needs of the province and run them on campus as appropriate.</p>
<p>6.  After the six provincial normal schools are closed, it is proposed to transform them into weaving and dyeing departments, linking them with the spinning mills that are about to open, which is not inappropriate. After the three women's normal schools are closed, the original funds should be used to run complete women's vocational schools, focusing on home economics and other departments. At the same time, special attention should also be paid to the housework and labor of general girls' middle schools and women's normal schools.</p>
<p>7.  The provincial junior animal husbandry vocational department is being run at the construction factory's animal husbandry experiment field and has achieved considerable success. However, the time limit is too short and the recurring expenses are also insufficient. In accordance with the regulations, the expenses of other provincial vocational schools should be increased uniformly.</p>
<p>8.  The provincial Yuncheng, Shuoxian, and Changzhi junior agricultural vocational schools have been ordered to stop enrolling students due to poor management. After the original students graduate, they will be reorganized, which is not inappropriate. However, preparations should be made early and the content should be enriched to build a good foundation.</p>
<p>9.  The leather making and ceramics departments of the industrial college have excellent equipment and should be opened as advanced vocational departments as soon as possible according to the original plan. The apprentice classes and pottery worker classes of the original dyeing and weaving departments should be changed to vocational supplementary classes. The agricultural college should also refer to the industrial college for management.</p>
<p>10. The research on pottery theft in the industrial college over the years has achieved some results, but the style, design, and coloring still need to be improved. The products produced seem to be too thick and the output is too small to meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>11. The private Mingxian Middle School has gold work, wool weaving factories, and a farm, which is rare in general middle schools. Junior high school students must learn all three, two hours per week. Senior high school students choose one of the three, six hours per week, to cultivate vocational interest. This should be advanced to the junior high school stage. In addition to two hours of in-class learning, use spare time to do more work to develop their interest in work. At the same time, investigate their personality, ability, and economic environment, divide them into two groups for further education and non-further education, and use existing equipment to attach appropriate agricultural and industrial vocational departments to train technicians.</p>
<p>12. The arm department of Datong County Industrial Apprentice School should be closed immediately and transformed into a chemical technology department. There are too many Chinese language hours in the shoe making and engraving departments, and the practice time is too short. The two hours of the Three Principles of the People should be changed to one hour of civics. The regulations of vocational supplementary schools should be referred to, with 70% of the time for work and 30% for class. The school name should also be changed to Datong County Industrial Technology Vocational Supplementary School.</p>
<p>13. The province ordered senior elementary schools in each county, or towns and villages planning to run senior elementary schools, to open vocational supplementary schools or classes. The departments should be based on the actual needs of the local area, and it is not appropriate to run commerce first in all cases. 14. Regarding vocational education for local women, a research committee should be convened with the county government to study the supplementary education institutions in each county that have improved women's weaving industry to varying degrees. If necessary, the administration of this project will be entirely managed by the department.</p>

<h3>Daxia Middle School: Continues to Run Kindergarten Normal Department</h3>
<p>Daxia University on Zhongshan Road in this city ran a kindergarten normal school in the autumn of 1930. The various facilities were quite large. Later, due to the January 28th Incident, the school was merged into the senior normal department of the attached Daxia Middle School. It is estimated that 28 students have graduated and are not idle, which shows that the society needs this kind of training urgently, and the school is suitable for training this kind of teacher. Now that the high school normal department is gradually coming to an end, and the society still urgently needs kindergarten teachers, the school has considerable equipment for this department. Therefore, it has submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to forward it to the Ministry of Education to approve the continuation of the kindergarten normal department in order to create more opportunities. It is reported that the school has received the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's instruction No. 236176 from the Ministry of Education approving the continuation. Therefore, it has been decided to enroll 50 new students (exclusively female) for the first semester during the summer vacation. The study period is set at three years. The admission qualification must be junior high school graduation, and a kindergarten is attached for practical teaching. It is reported that the school will continue to run the 8th summer school in order to use the summer time to expand educational efficiency. All important subjects in high and junior high school, such as Chinese, English, mathematics, science, chemistry, etc., will be selected to open classes.

<h3>Publication of Modern Navigation</h3>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Navigation is the only academic organization in the country that studies navigation. Since its establishment, it has made many contributions to the country and society. Now that there are more and more navigators, and most of the textbooks and reference books used are in foreign languages, scholars must spend a long time studying the language, but they have no time to study the scientific content in depth, resulting in more effort and less gain. This has long been a common problem in our country's education, and the slow progress of science has not been a major reason for this. The association, seeing this, publishes books on sailing techniques every year, intending to remedy this deficiency and facilitate scholars in our country who are interested in this. It is now heard that Yang Guanyuan, the chief editor of the association, has compiled a new Modern Navigation, which is based on new and practical materials. It is said that it has been inscribed and prefaced by famous Party-state figures and senior figures in navigation such as Hu Hanmin, Xu Jixiang, Ma Chaojun, Ouyang Ge, Wu Daming, Luo Panhui, and Zhang Zhijiang, which makes it even more impressive. The book has now been published, and major bookstores in this city are selling it.</p>

<h3>Finance American Silver Policy Unchanged, Gold Standard Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>Result of Lingering is Just a Small Triangle</p>
<p>The gold market initially rose and then fell yesterday. The market situation for half a day was extremely mediocre. The situation was stable in the middle. Both supply and demand lacked excitement. Foreign news reported that the US Treasury Secretary replied to the silver faction, saying that the government would continue to purchase silver and would not change its previous policy. The spot market also weakened, resulting in a slight setback. In the morning, the overseas silver market saw the British rise and the American shrink. The Monte Carlo forward silver price shrank, but not by much. Exchange rates all increased. London raw gold remained unchanged. Reports stated that a meeting of American silver faction congressmen was adjourned due to insufficient numbers and would be rescheduled. People's minds were still calm. Shanghai's pre-market trading opened at 71.x yuan. Major players entered the market, immediately pulling it up to 75.6 yuan before settling slightly. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both British and American rising. Customs gold units fell by 1.1%. The gold standard price was lowered again to 841.5 yuan, causing it to trend downwards immediately after opening. Refined gold only increased by 11 yuan. Banks' appetites became increasingly blocked. HSBC's listed prices announced a rise of 125 for the British pound and 4.375 for the American dollar. Traders actively engaged in arbitrage, lacking support and retreating into the 70 yuan range. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to provide support, managing to pull it up. However, with the exchange market hardening and selling pressure intensifying, it was difficult to sustain. Foreign news reported that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau had responded to inquiries from silver faction senators, saying that the government would not change its silver policy and would continue to purchase silver. This news coincided with HSBC's blocked sales, further breaking the 70 yuan mark. However, with limited trading, there was still support at the lower prices. It soon rose above 70 yuan, gradually recovering. Finally, the exchange market stabilized, and there was a lack of large supply and demand in the market, resulting in a calm market situation with narrow fluctuations. The final trend was flat with more consolidation. This is also what should have happened before the fall. I will now record the market situation for half a day.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 774.9 yuan, up 3.6 yuan from the previous close. Banks were willing to offer 9.37 million shillings.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Supply Exceeds Demand</h3>
<p>Resulting in Tight British, Loose American</p>
<p>According to foreign news, London's major transactions were close to 1/2 penny longer in supply, New York silver prices shrank by 3.75, Monte Carlo forward silver market shrank by 1.5% and varied, London raw gold was unchanged, British rose 1.625 against the US, US rose 0.375 against the British, British rose 42 pounds against the French, and the French shrank by 0.5. People's minds were slightly better due to the news that the joint meeting convened by US silver rise congressmen was adjourned due to insufficient numbers. The exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices, British exchange at 1 shilling 7 pence 875, US exchange at 40 yuan 9375, compared to the previous close, the British was tighter by 0.09375, and the US exchange was flat. This was also the impact of the increased exchange rate. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the British rising 125 and the American rising by 0.5 yuan. Customs gold fell by 1.1%, and people's minds were slightly calmed. It was heard that banks sold and trended looser. HSBC's listed prices announced a rise of 125 for the British pound and 4.375 for the American dollar. The situation was difficult to improve. Even if some banks took advantage of the cheap prices to close out, HSBC's sale of US exchange was quite strong. Foreign news also said that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau had replied to silver faction congressman McLaugh that the government would continue to buy silver, making it difficult to tighten. Finally, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhenfu supplied forward shillings, but because HSBC was closing out, the process still lacked special changes, but the potential force had already loosened. The noon close selling price for recent British exchange was 1 shilling 7 pence 9375, US exchange at 41 yuan 0625, compared to the previous close, the British was tighter by 0.03125, and the American was harder by 125.

<h3>Yarn and Flowers Yarn and Flowers Fall Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Different Psychological Expectations for Futures Yarn Between Chinese and Foreigners Buy on Lows Sell on Highs</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation became dull again. However, the sales of existing yarn can still be maintained. Guangdong, Yunnan, Hunan, Henan and other places have recently been particularly strong in purchasing cotton yarn. In addition, the financial turmoil has gradually stabilized. Some people have adopted the principle of buying on lows, but foreigners are still selling when prices rise.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Changfeng Sells</p>
<p>Standard Yarn: The market opened, and the near month was weaker. Auctions to the far term were slightly higher. Because the Guangdong Gang had made a lot of short coverings the previous day, the face was dry. However, foreign firms were still selling, and the pressure was still heavy. Auctions saw a slight rebound in the second and third rounds. At the close, Changfeng sold out and fell back. As a result, the near month fell by one point compared to the previous day's closing price, and the rapid rise was two points. The market suddenly fell after opening in the afternoon. There were new rumors stirring up in the market, and people's minds were shaken. The market fell step by step. However, the existing yarn sales market was still good, and the turnover was as high as 1,700 bales. As a result, the near month fell by 7 points to 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far month fell by 1 yuan. It was found that Jifeng sold 800 bales, Dafeng 850 bales, Jinchang 850 bales, Hexing 450 bales, Changfeng 3,000 bales, and Changyu 1,500 bales. Mingde bought 600 bales, Dafu 700 bales, Yida 650 bales, Daji 750 bales, Changyu 650 bales, Hexing 1,150 bales, Gengyue 2,450 bales, Shenji 750 bales, Yichang 800 bales, and Yongchang 750 bales. The high price and closing price for one day are listed below.</p>

<p>Total 207,500</p>
<p>Existing Yarn Sales Still Good</p>
<p>The sales of existing yarn are still good. It was found that the various gangs bought a total of 1,723 bales throughout the day, and the price rose by 0.5 point. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>Guangdong 30 Yunnan 150 Ningbo 3</p>
<p>Inland 50 Shantou 30 Changsha 100</p>
<p>Nanjing 1 Henan 534 Xuzhou 130</p>
<p>After the cotton market rose, it turned down again, but the US and Indian cotton markets rose and fell against each other, fluctuating by 2.x pounds. People's minds were still calm. However, the problem of yarn factory reducing work is still serious, so there are still many people selling. However, although the cotton sales market is clear, the selling price is not willing to fall sharply.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Yarn Belt</p>
<p>The market opened for standard flowers in the morning. The near month was flat, and the far month was slightly higher. Because of the sharp fall, there were two days of reaction, and the rebound was particularly strong, causing the loose shorts to be hit. There were fewer chips in the market. In the second and third auctions, the face was slightly lower. As a result, the near month fell by 5 points to 0.1 point, and the far month was flat. The market suddenly fell after opening in the afternoon. Because the yarn market was sluggish, the cotton market was dragged down. As a result, each month fell by another 0.15 point to 0.2 point compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 1,800 dan, Tongji 3,900 dan, Suilong 1,700 dan, Gengfeng 1,000 dan, Yifeng 1,700 dan, Renfeng 1,700 dan, and Tongxing 1,800 dan.

<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Differ</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened. Because the news from Liverpool was good and traders bought in, each month rose by 3 to 5 pounds. Then, because the bulls closed out, the weather was favorable, and fertilizer sales increased, the market price softened. Finally, because New Orleans and short accounts bought in, the market situation rose again. Near the close, the bulls closed out, the franc was weak, and there was a tendency to weaken again. Fortunately, the government bought in, and the close was still stable. It was estimated that spot fell by 5 pounds, and futures rose and fell by 1 to 5 pounds. According to the report by the National Fertilizer Association, a total of 237,000 tons were sold in the 12 southern provinces in May, an increase of 54% compared to last year. British cotton spot rose by 5 points, futures fell by 2-3 points. Indian cotton Japanese merchants sold new cotton, which was offset by retail investors buying in and hedging their positions. It was estimated that Pingguoer rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Omla rose and fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and Bailuo rose and fell by 0.5 to 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<h3>Grain: Widespread Drought Causes Flour and Wheat Prices to Surge</h3>
<p>The flour market yesterday saw another unanimous surge in prices during the morning. Although the quoted prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada saw a slight decrease of eight fractional points, industry insiders remained indifferent. Initial price offerings remained stable, but due to the continued severe drought in various regions, sentiments in inland areas became uniformly bullish. Consequently, buying interest surged after the market opened, driving prices upwards, prompting further purchases. Inland buyers also actively joined the buying spree, causing near-term futures to jump by a significant three to four fractional points. By the afternoon opening, near-term futures experienced a slight correction as factories engaged in minor hedging sales, stabilizing market sentiment. However, long-term futures saw fewer short positions, leading to robust demand and a tense market situation. Towards the close, prices retreated by about one fractional point as leveraged positions were unwound. Despite the lack of specific causes for the current upward trend, it is feared that market sentiment will remain strong unless widespread rainfall arrives. As a result, the price for this month rose by 1.25%, July rose by 3.75%, August rose by 4.5%, September rose by 4.375%, October rose by 5%, and November rose by 5.5%.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market also saw a unanimous surge. Following the wheat harvest, the Jiangnan and Jiangbei regions continue to suffer from severe drought. The great drought and massive disasters of last year remain fresh in memory. If sufficient rainfall does not arrive, public anxiety will inevitably escalate. The market was relatively stable in July, but the surge in the flour market triggered a sudden surge in buying interest, driving prices higher. General inland customers, witnessing this situation, dared not engage in excessive hedging, leading to demand exceeding supply and a continuous rise in prices. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment remained positive, and prices continued to rise by three to four fractional points. Subsequently, long positions were unwound, leading to a slight decline. As a result at closing, July futures rose by a significant 12 fractional points, August rose by 7 fractional points, September rose by 9 fractional points, and October rose by 11 fractional points. The current wheat market, due to the significant increase in standard wheat prices, cannot be ignored and has also seen a price increase of two to three fractional points. The market remains strong, with an estimated volume of over 5,000 bags. Henan old wheat was quoted at 3.45 yuan, Wuyi new wheat at 3.40 yuan, Daqiao Zhenjiang wheat at 3.34 yuan, Gaozi Puzhen Yangzhou wheat at 3.30 yuan, Mingguang wheat at 3.44 yuan, Zhitang Penglai wheat at 3.27 yuan, Danyang wheat at 3.30 yuan (second grade 3.27 yuan), Taicang wheat at 3.24 yuan, Anting wheat at 3.26 yuan, Jiading wheat at 3.16 yuan, Kunshan wheat at 3.26 yuan. Fuxin sold 3,200 bags, and Fufeng, Xinda, and Shenda collectively sold 1,700 bags.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to abolish the Winnipeg Grain Exchange for Chicago wheat, opposition is strong, and it is unlikely to be implemented. Estimated yields for the current winter and spring wheat harvests are approximately 67 million bushels, which is generally considered a substantial amount.</p>

<h3>Erratic Rainfall Causes Continued Rise in Foreign Rice Prices, While Du Geng Rice Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market continued to show firm and active trading yesterday. Due to uneven rainfall and widespread drought, particularly in the Jiangzhe interior, where drought disasters occurred last year, anxieties are heightened this year. Although there was no continued handling of Yangtze River shipments, inland demand was more active, and local merchants continued to fulfill orders. The market atmosphere remained tense, and Saigon No. 3 rice was sought after by local and Jiangzhe inland buyers, with prices rising by five fractional points. Shipments also remained buoyant. If strong demand continues and there is no widespread rain, rice prices are bound to rise again. Over 10,000 bags of Saigon rice were sold throughout the day, along with 60 bags each of Xiao Jiaoluo rice, and 745 bags of Ke Xian rice, with inland areas remaining the primary destination.</p>
<p>Local rice (South Shanghai) saw a total of 30 shipments yesterday (nearly 1,000 shi). Local sales were sluggish, and orders were not being fulfilled, causing the overall market to soften. South Hong Kong early rice prices fell, while other late rice varieties were also lower. Only Su Tong Geng rice remained stable due to limited supply. The yin bian yuan variety remained unaffected. (North Shanghai) 16 or 17 boats arrived from various river areas yesterday. Market demand remained weak, but sellers were reluctant to sell cheaply due to the drought. White Geng rice prices turned firmer again, while White Yuan and dry rice varieties stabilized. Prices for various grades of rice remained largely unchanged.</p>
<h3>Little Progress in Soybean Oil Market</h3>
<p>Niuzhuang soybean oil and Dalian soybean oil markets have been stagnant for several days due to weak market sentiment. However, despite prolonged stagnation, the market remains weak. Yesterday, only 200+ pieces of Niuzhuang oil were traded at 12.3 yuan, and Dalian oil at 11.7 yuan, prices lower than the recent prices by 8-9 fractional points. Qishan oil fell by two fractional points, and peanut oil fell by six to seven fractional points. A total of 1,000 pieces of soybean oil and 1,710 pieces of peanut oil were traded. Although soybean sales were moving to Dalian, where prices were being discounted, the market remains weak. Yesterday, existing Dou at Siping Street were quoted at only 3.58 yuan, with 15 carloads purchased by factories. Other wheeled beans were also traded for 7,000 bags, but prices remained weak, with fluctuations of around four fractional points.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Refuses to Follow Price Declines</h3>
<p>The sugar market remained weak yesterday due to slow sales. The guild's standard quotation for current spot prices of 24-grade raw white sugar was 16.1 yuan, with only a few dozen bags traded, slightly lower than the previous day's price. Imported goods were quoted slightly lower by 0.05 yuan at 5.45 yuan, but saw little buying interest. Taikoo Sugar had few orders and was unwilling to follow price declines. B-grade sugar was released at 17.4 yuan. The local Zhenyu No. 1 fine white sugar remained unchanged at 5.5 yuan. The company's Zishui brand was still quoted at 20.6 yuan for No. 2 and 20.5 yuan for No. 1, although there were slight discounts in off-market trading. The state-owned Chaoqing sugar brands were only quoted, with Tizhuang Qing at 10.6 yuan, Huangge Qing at 10.4 yuan, and Longgang Qing at 9.6 yuan, but no deals were made. Dongbai continued to release No. 8 sugar at 15.9 yuan and No. 4 at 16 yuan, slightly lower than the previous quotation by 0.1 yuan. Dongchi sugar was at 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dongtang Imports Largest in Volume</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's statistical results, Japan had the largest volume of sugar imports in May: 4,001.5 metric tons of granulated sugar, 63,351 metric tons of crystal sugar, and 39,970 metric tons of brown sugar. Imports from Java included 84,702 metric tons of granulated sugar. Imports from Hong Kong included 4,751 metric tons of granulated sugar, 1,658.94 metric tons of crystal sugar, and 877 metric tons of other sugars. Imports from the United States included 47 metric tons of granulated sugar, 10.89 metric tons of brown sugar, and 43 metric tons of other sugars. In total, granulated sugar imports amounted to 88,487.97 metric tons, crystal sugar imports amounted to 66,009.97 metric tons, brown sugar imports amounted to 13,981 metric tons, and other sugar imports amounted to 963 metric tons.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Qimen Flower Scented Black Tea Sales Improve with Russian Support</h3>
<p>In the last two weeks, Qimen flower-scented black tea has seen increased interest from foreign firms due to assistance from Russian companies. British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Concordia, Tongfu, and Tianyu are actively searching for supplies. The total number of cases sold has reached 5,700, with prices around 20 yuan, similar to rough black tea prices. Due to its superior natural quality, it is easier to sell than Ningzhou teas from the two Hubei provinces. The green tea market remained largely unchanged yesterday. Transactions for high-quality Zhen Mei, needle-shaped, and silk teas remained active, but there were no large-scale sales of low-grade and lower-quality goods.</p>
<h3>Metals: Thin Tinplate Procured by Xi'an Merchants</h3>
<p>The tinplate market has been stagnant since the Hebei merchants stopped purchasing, and toy factories also stopped buying. Standard prices have been unusually weak, with each box selling for only 48 yuan. Recently, merchants from Xi'an and biscuit factories in Shanghai have suddenly begun purchasing, buying 60-70 boxes at a price of 49 yuan per box, an increase of 1 yuan from before. It is reported that there have been few recent shipments of this product, and Shanghai inventory is also low, so market sentiment and confidence are stable.</p>

<h3>Effective Methods for Students to Use National Products</h3>
<p>— Pan Jiayu</p>
<p>It is universally known that citizens should use national products. How can students, as representatives of the intellectual class, not do their best to promote their use? There are indeed reasons for this, which can be stated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Many lower-level students are unable to discern whether goods are national products or foreign goods.</p>
<p>(2) Unethical merchants often falsely claim that foreign goods are national products.</p>
<p>(3) Some are unaware that there are similar national products to certain foreign goods.</p>
<p>(4) Some overlook the importance of national products because of the temporary lower prices of foreign goods.</p>
<p>The reasons are as stated above, specifically the deception of unscrupulous merchants and the negligence of the students themselves. Therefore, students' failure to fully utilize national products should not be immediately labeled as "unpatriotic." It is truly because the methods of promoting national products have not been perfected and made effective.</p>
<p>The so-called effective methods are not mere empty talk but concrete measures implemented in practice. To avoid the above four issues, one must prevent students from being deceived and ensure that they can confirm that the goods they use are national products. To achieve this, there must be an organized and systematic student joint consumer cooperative. I will now present my tentative ideas, outlining the organization and methods, as a reference for implementation.</p>
<p>This cooperative must be proactively formed by students or supported by national product trade organizations. It can start with one school initiating the process, inviting representatives from various schools to organize preparatory matters. Then, student self-governing associations from middle schools and above can elect committee members, and lower-level schools can appoint teachers as committee members to jointly organize the committee to handle the process. At the same time, a supervisory committee is also formed to oversee the committee's work.</p>
<p>The responsibility of this committee is to organize consumer cooperatives, adopting a trust-like agency system but without charging commissions. On the one hand, it connects with honest and trustworthy merchants or manufacturers to conduct trade with the most suitable prices and the most reliable national products. On the other hand, it properly handles the application of goods needed by students. The so-called student application goods can be divided into three categories: stationery, clothing, and other supplies. We will now discuss each of these categories separately based on their nature:</p>
<p>(1) Stationery: Stationery is used by students at all times, and its consumption is the largest, so the potential for waste is also the greatest. However, it is very difficult to distinguish whether it is a foreign product or a national product, because foreign products using "Made in China" are countless, making it impossible to determine. Furthermore, the prices are mostly not expensive, and sometimes buyers easily overlook them and do not investigate deeply. Now, to promote national stationery, we can reform the school's inherent small store. The students of each school can gather shares to establish a fund to purchase the required stationery. The purchased goods must be inspected by the cooperative committee, and a resident committee member can be assigned to each school to investigate or report.</p>
<p>(2) Clothing: If we seek to use only national products for student clothing materials, it will be difficult to carry out in practice because the clothing materials of various students are generally different. Therefore, to encourage the use of national products, implementing a school uniform system is the only solution. The committee of this cooperative can first send a letter to the school authorities, agreeing to act as an agent. The school authorities select the color, material, and price range, and then the committee properly selects the most economical and high-quality national products for students to purchase and wear uniformly.</p>
<p>(3) Other Supplies: Other application items such as artistic and technical application items, such as cameras and printing machines, can also be handled by the cooperative. However, the method is slightly different. First, the requesting buyer submits a purchase request (specifying the name, type, style, and price range of the item) to the committee, applying for purchase and paying a corresponding deposit. The committee agrees to deliver it within a few days, and then the remaining payment is paid to collect the goods.</p>
<p>If the above three items can be implemented, the effectiveness will be considerable, and there are three benefits:</p>
<p>First, in principle, it can promote national products.</p>
<p>Second, in practice, students can save money economically.</p>
<p>Third, the success of this organization can provide students with good practical experience and strengthen the relationship between students, cultivating a sense of unity.</p>
<h3>Three Things that Chinese People Should Pay Attention to</h3>
<p>— Pan Yishi</p>
<p>Another year has easily passed, and half of the twenty-fourth year is already over. This year was designated as the Student National Products Year. The scene of representatives from various schools swearing to use national products is still vividly like in front of my eyes. This publication has carried many articles on promoting national products. On the whole, I think the results will not repeat the mistakes of the Women's National Products Year!</p>
<p>Because students are young and promising, energetic young people, with knowledge and enthusiasm. Therefore, the implementation effect will not disappoint people too much, but there are a few points that we should pay special attention to, and I specifically bring them up for discussion.</p>
<p>First, shift the aesthetic concept. Generally speaking, Chinese people have a common problem, that is, they think that foreign-made things are all good. For example, if someone asks A where he bought this item, A will definitely answer that it was from large companies such as Huila or Wing On. Only in this way can he show his generosity. This kind of malpractice is wrong. Not only should we not glorify extravagance, but we don't need to blindly believe in foreign goods. We should take simplicity as the main thing. For everything in daily life, we only seek spiritual comfort and pleasure. There is no need to care about the material enjoyment and satisfaction. We should be proud of buying national products. Everyone unanimously resists foreign goods, even if foreign goods desperately come to dump them and take over our own business market?</p>
<p>Second, discard the concept of vanity, and develop the habit of seeking truth from facts. Most people are delayed by vanity all their lives, to the point of being irreparable. Not only are rights lost, but even the country is destroyed and the family is destroyed. This is a big reason. From now on, we should discard vanity and put this spirit into the welfare of the country, so that we can solve any difficult things.</p>
<p>Third, act with conscience. Most people hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat. On the surface, they speak thoughtfully. We should love the country, promote national products, and restore rights and interests. But in reality? I am still a salesman for foreign goods, and indirectly selling out the country. It is absolutely wrong to bury my conscience like this.</p>
<p>If we can pay attention to the above three points and work hard to do it, I don't think it will take ten years. I guarantee that the country will be rich and the people will be strong, and the impact of any recession will not invade our territory again.</p>
<h3>The Weekly Meeting of the Nanjing National Products Company</h3>
<p>— Shi Ming</p>
<p>——The Significance Is Worth Emulating——</p>
<p>Nanjing National Products Company. Opened on the Double Tenth Festival last year. Business is very developed. At the beginning of its establishment. Former Mayor Shi Ying was appointed as chairman of the board. Shi held himself with integrity and honesty. He usually wears cloth clothes and coarse clothes. Dedicated to promoting national products. Therefore, You Le helped it succeed. Manager Ge Liangchou. Smart and capable. Very serious about doing things. Outstanding achievements in internal management. As a result, the business is booming.</p>
<p>To want the development and success of a career in the business world. The first. It is solid in the proper management. The so-called calculated win. Careful planning. Must be careful at all times. Catch up. Make the goods sold not miss the timeliness. Turnover is easy to circulate. Then it will be of help. Second. It is in the appropriate personnel management. No management means no plan. And management is too strict. Lost in rigidness. There is no vitality. Too lax. It is easy to become licentious. Affect the job. To be tolerant and strict. Both rigid and soft. It is in the manager's ability to have the knowledge of the times. Recognize the business itself and the environment. Deal with it with a dedicated spirit. Adapt to circumstances without harming the business. That's almost it.</p>
<p>Nanjing National Products Company. There is one point worth mentioning in terms of personnel management. Every Tuesday morning at 7:30 a.m. (the company usually opens for business at 8:30 a.m.). The manager convenes all employees. Hold weekly talks on the second floor. The scope of the talks is to develop business and promote the spirit of patrol service. Including merchants' ethics and youth's advanced studies. Any kind of national product that is sluggish in sales. Any kind that caters to the needs. I will also discuss it from time to time. Participating employees. You can express your opinions. To eliminate barriers. A gathering to blend feelings. To dissect the essence of the matter. Rational judgment. To seek the promotion of one's own business. This kind of approach. The meaning is really commendable. Mr. Ge said that the business world is most afraid of the manager and employees. Each is due to the relationship in status. Do not talk to each other. It's like dividing the Hongtao. To affect the effectiveness of service. Leading to intangible losses. Human resources are not reduced. It's really sighable. Mr. Wan has gained this kind of experience. Continuing to generate legitimate management. At the same time, he sets an example everywhere. Words and deeds are consistent. Business prospects. Naturally, it will be promoted in order.</p>
<p>The times are evolving. Commercial knowledge must be adequately equipped. So that you can deal with it with ease. In today's world, to be the leader of an industry. Then how to complete the conditions for this leader's qualifications. Make the industry successful and the matter belongs. It's a prerequisite issue. The author is by no means using private superficial views. Boasting about Mr. Wan's strengths. Only with Nanjing National Products Company. As a giant of the capital's commerce. The meaning of his weekly meeting is enough to facilitate management. It is beneficial to both the body and mind. It seems that it can be used as a model for the national business community. It is not harmful to spread it. Finally, I hope that those who follow the example will pay attention. If you also hold weekly talks. Its motivation should be to connect feelings and exchange opinions. Fortunately, do not make it like the speech of an official. It would be boring and lose its meaning.</p>

<h3>Thoughts After the Bankruptcy of the Shanghai National Products Company</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Over the past Dragon Boat Festival, unfortunate bad news continued to come! The Shanghai National Products Company, which has made considerable efforts in the national products sector, has actually been reported to have gone bankrupt! This cannot but make people sigh! I feel a painful thing - when foreign goods are dumped - invading the mainland urgently! The front line of my national products sector has shaken again, isn't it over? Indeed, the National Products Company owes money to creditors, and the holiday season has arrived, which cannot be taken lightly, but owing money is a small matter, and destroying a well-known national products agency, damaging the original energy of the national products sector! Affect the entire business market! Cut off the livelihood of workers! Increasing the number of unemployed in society is even more serious!</p>
<p>Secondly: the shareholders who founded the National Products Company, and the managers who presided over the national products business, should reflect on themselves; first, they should concentrate on the planning of the business and not hold other positions at the same time; second, they should work hard with all their energy and down-to-earth, how to promote national products, how to strictly employ people, how to tighten expenses, and how to consolidate the economy, holding calculations and plans every evening! Where else can you put your heart on foreign affairs?</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhijun's boldness! We should admire, but his concurrent positions are not specialized, scattered and unplanned, and meaningless exaggeration! Not seeking practical enrichment! Is his big disease! The car overturned in front, the car behind the mirror! Those who operate the national products business, do they know how to be frightened and vigilant?</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting the Wenguang Brand Carbon Paper Factory</h3>
<p>— Qin Xi</p>
<p>One day, I went to the stationery section of a certain bookstore to buy carbon paper. The clerk asked, "Do you want foreign carbon paper or Chinese carbon paper?" I was very surprised to hear this. Carbon paper, I thought, was only imported. Could there be a Chinese version? At that time, I told the clerk that I wanted Chinese carbon paper. He took out a box for me to look at. I saw that the outside of the box was dark blue, and the front of the box had the words "Please Use Domestic Goods, Wenguang Brand Carbon Paper, Shanghai Wenguang Craft Company." I was very excited to take out the carbon paper to observe, but the surface was just so-so. Fortunately, the price was only seventy cents in silver dollars, so I bought a box and took it home to try. Wow! It was really good. Carefully checking the description inside the box, I learned that the Wenguang Craft Company was located in Huiyuan Lane, Huade Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although I am not a twelve or thirteen-year-old child, my curiosity is stronger than anyone else's. How is carbon paper made? I wanted to know a little about it. So, last Saturday afternoon, taking advantage of having nothing to do, I took the number 10 bus to visit the Wenguang Craft Company. The company was in the second alley of Huiyuan Lane, and there was an enamel sign on the door that read "Factory Restricted Area, No Admittance." It was inconvenient to knock on the door and go in. However, next to the door of the neighboring house, there was another enamel sign that read "Wenguang Craft Company," so I raised my hand and knocked on the brass ring. In less than a minute, an elderly man of about fifty years old came out and invited me in, asking what was the matter. I took out a business card and explained that I had come specifically to visit the factory. He did not refuse and even expressed a welcoming tone. After exchanging pleasantries, he led me to take a look around. I saw that the factory was steaming with heat, and a dozen or so workers were working hard. The following Q&amp;A is the little bit of new knowledge I gained:</p>
<p>(Question) When was your company founded?</p>
<p>(Answer) It was initiated in October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), and opened on December 1st of the same year.</p>
<p>(Question) What is your company's capital, how many shareholders are there, and is it a company in nature?</p>
<p>(Answer) The capital is only a few thousand dollars, there are only four or five shareholders, and in fact, it can be called a limited partnership.</p>
<p>(Question) Was this manufacturing method learned from abroad, or was it invented by yourself?</p>
<p>(Answer) Foreign carbon paper manufacturing uses very complex printing machines. These machines are very expensive, and we don't have much capital, so we are temporarily using manual labor. When we expand in the future, we must use machines. However, the current manual manufacturing is the result of much research.</p>
<p>(Question) What raw materials are used to make carbon paper? Can you tell me where these raw materials come from?</p>
<p>(Answer) We use many kinds of raw materials, such as stearin, paraffin, kanshan, drying oil, sodium carbonate, etc., too many to list. Some of these things are purchased from Western pharmacies, and some are purchased from raw material stores. However, we absolutely avoid buying inferior goods, and this can be testified to by Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>(Question) Then, there are many inferior goods of popular paper types on the market. Can you avoid them all?</p>
<p>(Answer) This can be proved by the brand on the colored leather. If you don't believe it, please come to the office and I will show you the evidence.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we returned to the previous room. He took out a package of paper from the drawer and picked out many paper brand signs, such as Czechoslovakian brands, German Baibeiles Paper Factory brands, and various logos of Liu Hai Trading Company of Han Kee Foreign Firm, managed by Norway. I am a layman when it comes to paper, but after this conversation, I realized that the paper mills in Western countries are indeed very great. As I was about to ask more questions, the telephone on the wall rang loudly. I thanked him and left.</p>
<p>A Week of New Information from the Domestic Goods Industry</p>
<p>Textile expert Mr. Wei Xudong spent three years successfully creating ramie yarn. He plans to establish the China Ramie Textile Company to specialize in manufacturing it. Industry leaders Rong Zongjing and Guo Shun have already testified to this.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry recently plans to set up paper mills and silk factories to plug huge financial leaks.</p>
<p>Various merchant groups in this city held a joint meeting on the 7th and decided to establish the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce National Exhibition. The preparatory office is located in the City Chamber of Commerce exhibition hall, and many guidelines for the process were passed.</p>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau of the International Trade Bureau sent separate letters to domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai, Ping, Jin, Min, and other places, soliciting products to participate in the Belgian Commodity Exhibition Hall. They are to be sent to the National Trade Bureau by the end of this month and shipped to Belgium in early July.</p>
<p>The Zhenru District Student Domestic Goods Exhibition, sponsored by the Student Domestic Goods Promotion Association, opened on the 10th at Jinan University.</p>
<p>Tianjin and Changsha recently plan to prepare for domestic goods exhibitions. Mr. Qi Shao'an, director of the Tianjin Domestic Goods Exhibition Hall, has come to Shanghai to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Since its opening, the Domestic Goods City in this city has been doing very well. Every day, many people come to the city to shop and visit. The Shanghai National Products Company, which was forced to close due to the collapse of the Ningbo Industrial Bank, may be re-opening soon. Unemployed employees sent a letter to Mr. Ren Jinpin, inviting enthusiastic domestic goods leaders to find a way to resume operations.</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies has banned the import of Chinese medicinal wines since July 1st.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Linghu Zhao)</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, "a person's life" is nothing more than "birth, old age, sickness, and death." If you want to discuss all the relationships between individuals and the country and society, whether you are doing great national salvation work or trivial neighborhood affairs, you must lay the foundation of common knowledge around the age of twenty!</p>
<p>Otherwise, when you are nearly forty or fifty years old and your brainpower is weakening, it will be too late to lay the foundation of common knowledge, isn't it?</p>
<p>To be honest, when we reach forty or fifty years old, when Confucius said we are "not to be feared," how can our blood and energy be as strong as when we were young? At this time, the goal is only to do "old age, sickness, and death" work. In fact, to be frank, this work is nothing more than trying to make some money for the future!</p>
<h3>A Pile of Walls (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>When I see the four characters "Clean Wall Movement" on this paper, a pile of walls that are commonly seen on the streets of our country will appear in my mind.</p>
<p>Originally, it was a very good pile of walls, but it was damaged and soiled by the wind, rain, and moss, which was unavoidable. However, our walls, which were brand new a few days ago, have been decorated with all kinds of artificial coatings, becoming a bizarre ancient painting; and they fully show all kinds of evil roots.</p>
<p>Clearly written are the four large characters "Posting Prohibited," but above them, the glittering and brilliant theater previews and store discount sales advertisements are densely plastered with a thick layer, which can even be used as a mat. Below it is written, "Urination Prohibited, Violators Will Be Arrested," or a very large tortoise is painted, but the yellow urine stains at the foot of the wall and the pungent smell are like a sign to attract urination. The above two facts tell people about the bad habit of "knowingly violating public morals."</p>
<p>Also! On narrow red strips of paper, it is written "Selling Severe Cold - See Immediate Results," or "Heaven Yellow, Earth Yellow, My Family Has a Crying Child, Kind Gentlemen, Recite Once and Sleep Through the Night." This kind of witchcraft and harmful-to-others-but-not-beneficial-to-oneself tone fully demonstrates the lack of common sense among the people.</p>
<p>Red and green posters with the words "×× Hall Guarantees Treatment of Syphilis and Gonorrhea" also occupy the central position of the wall, which indicates the phenomenon of "prostitution is rampant, nine out of ten are sick."</p>
<p>Street urchins, with nothing to do, also draw rough lines and misshapen models on the walls; they also write slogans such as "×× Little Five Cars ×× Ten Bones," which can also indicate our social education and children's education.</p>
<p>Such walls, standing on the streets, are truly laughable and tearful to appreciate carefully!</p>
<h3>A Record of Tea Tasting in the Summer House</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>On the day before the Beginning of Summer, I visited the dwelling of Old Man Zao Fen. It was noon, and we had a meal together. The clear sun filled the empty courtyard, the clouds were fixed, and there was no wind. After drinking a little wine, my limbs felt soft, and we agreed to take a nap like Zai Yu. When I woke up, the setting sun was hanging on the eaves. I watched two white rabbits fighting for vegetable leaves: their eyes were like red rubies, they lifted their long ears, and their cheeks moved quickly. I felt very comfortable. Suddenly, I thought of tea, which would write of leisure. Then I remembered Xia Yizi, whom I hadn't seen for two years. He hangs his teapot on Beijing Road, selling both tea and inkpad; and he is still the tea emperor dominating Shanghai. At this time, Uncle Fan also arrived, so the three of us went straight to Xia's house. After a short while, Yizi came out and shook hands with us, talking loudly. The four of us, in a space that was neither elegant nor vulgar, sat around a square table, cleaned the teapot and plates, and rinsed the cups and dishes. First, we tried "Ming Qian." Yizi has been working with tea for many years, and his skills are like a doctor's. He showed his unique skills, dripping tea into the tea plate, so full that it did not overflow. Before it reached the nose, a clear fragrance had already arrived; before it reached the lips, saliva was already being produced. From this, I knew that the water must have come from Hupao; and the tea-producing place must be in Shifeng. The wax spring of Hupao can be sealed and stored for three years without spoiling; the leaves of Shifeng are as long as a flag and a spear; even if there is a slight difference, it is still credible. Then we tried "Lotus Flower," which was warm, rich, and lingered on the jaw. It was like being in a riverside pavilion after the rain, quietly facing the new lotus, the jade ring was silent, and the stream guest felt sad. I gazed into the distance, thinking of the center of the Wan River. Where else should I be buried? Finally, we tasted "Wild Tea," which came from Qinghai. Only two or three catties are harvested each year, because no medicine-gathering old man ties a rope and flies into the sky, exhausting the highest and most mysterious places, so it cannot be obtained. Its color is red, its taste is mellow, sweet and tough. It can be steeped twenty or thirty times, and the taste does not change much, and the color does not fade much. I guess it grows on dangerous peaks, receiving much of the essence of frost and dew, so it is so magical! We tasted a total of three varieties, two tastings of each: "Ming Qian" was round, "Lotus Flower" was sharp, and "Wild Tea" was broad. However, making tea is really difficult to describe: it must be accurate in weight and temperature, and the timing must be precise. Therefore, even if you get Yunyu Phoenix Claws and cook Hupao spring water, if it is not in Yizi's hands, the taste will not be pure, and without Yizi to match, the comments will not be elegant; if you taste it without the right person, then even if it is beautiful, you will not fully understand its meaning. If Guanzhi hears this, he should not think it is irrelevant?</p>
<h3>The Cause of Struggle</h3>
<p>— (Jiang Mi)</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Another Kind of Understanding: Westerners Talk About Construction, Not Without Regrets; Seven Kinds of Lovesickness</p>
<p>You Rong said: There is no mistake in helping them with this matter. Poor people have their own poor calculations. If Wang Jun really marries this girl, perhaps he has a way. As for that girl, she can endure hardship and is hardworking, I guarantee there will be no problem. Zhichang saw him holding the hem of his long gown with both hands, lifting one foot and stepping on the stool, striking a very heroic pose. There is no need to describe that excitement. He then laughed: I am really in a difficult position. If I help him with this marriage, in fact, I feel it is not right. I oppose it, right? Mr. Zhou is so enthusiastic. You Rong said: Originally! You are a boss in Little Western Paradise, and you are so considerate and thoughtful to him, of course, there is a possibility of getting close. Wang Jun's suspicion is also within the bounds of human emotion. But in my eyes, I would not think like that, because you have great interests in mind, and even if you live in Xi'an for a few days, you do many things. Why would you pay attention to a disaster victim? Therefore, although I think Wang Jun's suspicion is natural, I do not suspect Mr. Cheng. Precisely because I do not suspect Mr. Cheng, I boldly advise Mr. Cheng to make it happen. Mr. Cheng, what do you think of my idea? Saying this, he looked at Zhichang with a smile. This made Zhichang not know what to say. He scratched his head and laughed, "You seem to be using a trick to encourage me. But since you are so enthusiastic, I will reluctantly follow your wishes. When the North Sea dries up, I will sound him out." Only then did Zhou You Rong put down his leg, lower his sleeves, and bow to him. (238)</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>How beautiful is the scenery on the lake! The water is as clear as jade, and we can see all the way to the bottom of the lake from the boat. The lotus stalks that have not yet emerged from the water are easy to count one by one. People stare at the lake water for a long time, and their eyes suddenly feel several times brighter. Especially moving are the five-colored goldfish raised in the lake, which often wag their tails and pass through the green waves, like a line of red silk: some of the larger ones can even jump out of the water, making crisp, soft sounds and round ripples.</p>
<p>The sunlight shines impartially on our bodies, filling us with a vibrant vitality, and everyone forgets all worries and sufferings, preparing to enjoy themselves to the fullest. At that time, the palaces built by Wantao happened to be right in front of us. Looking at them from the boat in the distance, they were like the immortal mountains and pavilions depicted in novels.</p>
<p>The flowers and trees in the Summer Palace are originally very abundant, especially along the lake, there are especially many; tall, short, woody, herbaceous, there are really countless. From the boat, we can vaguely see them rising and falling in the bright sunlight with the wind, and at the same time, the fragrant flowers are constantly released because of their rising and falling. Occasionally blowing into our nostrils, there is a real feeling of refreshing the heart and spleen. (338)</p>
<h3>The Last Lesson</h3>
<p>— Ms. Fuji</p>
<p>I once read a French novel by the famous writer Daudet, translated by Hu Shi, "The Last Lesson." I felt that it depicted a cowardly elementary school student's patriotism in a profound and ironic way. It was much more interesting than those novels with patriotic themes that were laid out in a straightforward way. It wrote about the German soldiers pressing the border, and after the war was settled, this elementary school student realized that his past neglect and truancy when he could study his national language was wrong, and once he woke up, he wanted to turn to a book of his national language, but it was forbidden by others and impossible.</p>
<p>Because the last resort of a dead country is to destroy the culture of the country being destroyed, so that its history can be completely forgotten, permanently sinking, and unable to transcend. Such a poisonous trick, when you read the novel, you will still be indignant, and you will have more vigilance in your heart.</p>
<p>This announcement on the paper is still not popular. After watching the new film directed by Shen Xiling, "Nostalgia," there is also an interlude of "The Last Lesson," which makes me realize that its power is above Daudet's novel!</p>
<p>Foreign aggression is frequent, is it time to wake up? I hope everyone can watch this "Last Lesson" in the film, on the one hand, they can be alert to themselves, and on the other hand, they can also compare it with Daudet's novel to see who has the advantage in terms of artistic position. Fortunately, the screening of "Nostalgia" will probably not be too late.</p>
<h3>Pinghua Dream</h3>
<p>— (Made in a Boat on Yushan Mountain) Old Man Mingshan</p>
<p>Where is the clear stream and green water? Pinghua piles up and opens golden coins, with several houses leaning against the mountain and facing the stream. In the house, it is as if they are tuning the ice string. When the door opens, a golden bell rings, and suddenly good news falls from the sky. A good son and a good son-in-law come out to greet him (referring to Tu Cen and his eldest daughter Suye), holding hands and asking if they are well. The jade-like snow that has just been weaned from the breast is the granddaughter of the famous mountain. The gold and stone in the room are worth a lot of money. Not a single word is lost from the Qiyang drum. My son's study of seal script is even more refined, with a clear and leisurely artistic conception and a ancient and渾厚气. The five-foot-high attic behind the house, with white cranes coming and going from time to time on the eaves. The green Xiaohua dust-free does not open the seal, and it will be left for Mingshan to live in in the future.</p>
<p>World News</p>
<h3>Japanese Graves</h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>The Japanese people are popular for cremation, and the ashes are placed in a wooden box and buried under a stone tower, so it does not take up much land. There are very few private graves, and most of them are buried in the open space near the temple. There are many temples in Japan, just like in our country, they have occupied all the famous mountains and scenery. There is a lot of open space on the mountains, which is used as a public cemetery. And the Japanese people all believe in Buddhism, so the temples have become their cemeteries.</p>
<p>The shape of the stone tower is very similar to the Mongolian Lama Tower, completely made of granite. It is more than ten feet high, and the stone base is about six feet square, with two or three steps. A cube-shaped stone block is placed on top, and then a round pillar of two or three feet high, the top of which is the square top of the tower, shaped like the top mark of a pagoda in our country, is carved from a whole piece of stone. The name, age, date of birth and death of the deceased are engraved on the round pillar. Men are called Jushi, and women are called Big Sister, which means good men and good women in our country. The ashes are hidden under the tower and are not easily exposed. There are also two or three people buried in one tower together, mostly brothers and sisters who died young. They do not have the custom of husband and wife being buried together in the same cave.</p>
<p>If you pay attention to the tomb, you can spend a few more dollars to buy a larger plot of land. Stone railings are built around the stone tower. There are also Kumen and stone gates and sills built in front of the tomb. In short, the things on the tombs of the Japanese people in the past were all made of stone. Now there have been improvements, using iron gates and fences. Stone towers are also made of artificial stone, but not many.</p>
<p>The graves of the middle class and below are only three or four feet high. Some can't even afford to build a stone tower. A small monument stands on a Huai Fang stone. The poorest of the poor, a root of white wood square column is inserted on the tomb, with the name written on it. Recently, as the public cemetery system in our country has gradually been promoted, they also have a public charnel house with the same meaning as a public cemetery. A large stone tower is built in the temple, and countless ashes can be placed underneath. The required price is more comfortable and cheaper than buying a tomb.</p>
<p>On the ground in front of the stone tower, there are also stone-made incense burners and candlestick stands. There are also stone vases for inserting Western flowers. The descendants often come to offer flowers, pray, and burn incense candles, but not often.</p>
<p>The tombs of the royal family and nobles are of course very different. The Nongchuan Family Temple in Shiba Park represents everything. The Tokugawa shogunate once acted as regent, and later returned it to the Japanese Emperor, and even now the descendants are still sealed as Dukes. The Japanese people admire Tokugawa and the Japanese Emperor the same. The family temple is very large, built on the mountain, divided into three layers. It is completely ancient Chinese architecture, probably similar to the architecture of the Ming Dynasty in our country.</p>
<p>The outermost is the Tang Gate, fully engraved with three-dimensional flowers, plants, mountains and rivers. Inside the gate there is a horizontal corridor, wooden wall, and also delicate carvings, like the carved short walls in our country's gardens. Directly opposite is the hall where the Baidian is built. Although it is not tall, it is brilliantly painted and extremely luxurious. Further inside, after passing the passage, is the Xiang Hall where portraits are hidden. The gold-lacquered shrine and the ancient offerings are arranged like a shrine or ancestral hall in our country. Behind the hall, at the top of the stone steps, is the stone tower for storing bones, which is similar to ordinary ones and is not very particular. There are a total of six or seven such palaces, enshrining the descendants of Tokugawa.</p>
<p>On the open space outside the hall, there are bell towers and ablution halls, facing each other on the left and right. Stone lanterns and copper lanterns are arranged on both sides, totaling more than a thousand. They are all carved with dragons and phoenixes, and the project is very large. The high and sloping roof is covered with green copper tiles. The doors and beams are all floating carvings of dragon and phoenix cloud heads. Plum blossoms, orchids, bamboos, chrysanthemums, and mountain rocks are just like Chinese paintings. Other things like the wooden pillars of Panji, painted with vermilion lacquer, depicting full-color patterns, and murals of lions and beauties. Everything is similar to the architecture of the Forbidden City in our country. Beautiful clothes, I am afraid that the tombs and mausoleums of the Japanese people are nothing more than this.</p>

<h3>Profoundity and Novelty</h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>In the Free Talk on June 6th, Mr. Wu wrote an article called "Rot and Abuse," opposing people who write articles using clichéd and abusive language. Although this opinion is not new, it is very good. But under the same theme, he fiercely attacked "putting effort into fixed sentences," attacking "deliberately writing," attacking "refusing to take the ordinary path," attacking "profoundity" and "novelty," which is really a bit strange.</p>
<p>There are at least two kinds of clichéd and abusive language commonly expressed in articles. The first is the corruption and abuse in thinking, and the second is the corruption and abuse in writing. Let's think about it: if there is nothing worth contributing to the reader in the article, and it only takes a hundred words to write an article for a lifetime, "superficial" is right, "ordinary" is right, and "fresh" is also very "fresh," but what help has he given to mankind? As for the corruption and abuse in writing, there are also two kinds: those seen in modern Chinese are naturally "trembling heartstrings," "pilgrimage," "scenic line," and "eyelids," while those seen in classical Chinese are "not only this," "pick up," "thorn hairpin cloth skirt," "unique style," "swords drawn and bows bent," etc.; and terms such as "institution," "architecture," "contradiction," and "trend" have their own scientific meanings. They will never be corrupt and abusive.</p>
<p>I oppose high-mindedness because it is hypocritical and divorced from reality; but I also oppose vulgarity because it is cowardly and often hinders the footsteps of reality. What forms the backbone of this vulgarity is "generalism." For a long, long time, generalism has been linked to the old problems of the Chinese people. Speaking vague and floating words, only touching the surface of everything and thinking that they already understand, writing articles without any real description or accurate judgment, always living a life of humor, funny, and frivolous ridicule, turning serious things into comic relief, calling serious things stupid, and calling difficult things stupid—this is the essence of generalism. For such people, there is not a day of sweating profusely, and even if there is, they have to change it to "not gasping for breath, not changing face." In short, everyone is like an official in the late Qing Dynasty, saying that a major event is "easy," but the result is not doing it.</p>
<p>Without unique insights, you cannot write a thesis, and without unique observations, you cannot write a creation. This uniqueness, because the reader has not thought about it, is profound; because the reader has not seen it, it is novel. When an author wants to express the unique and truly valuable things that he has grasped, he has to put effort into every word and sentence, and deliberately express it in the most appropriate, most precise, and most powerful way, and refuse to be clever and lazy, muddling through and letting it be ruined by superficial and weak敷衍. We do not think authors should be mocked, but rather the mockers themselves should be mocked.</p>
<p>Without knowing the truth of art, without demanding the deepening of the theme, and without seeing the complexity of reality, there will never be a good work.—What are you still saying about greatness?</p>
<p>As far as I can see, all the clichéd and abusive language is probably hidden in smooth-tongued and ordinary articles, written by vulgar and general writers who specialize in catering to the reader's shortcomings. These writers often give readers "a little easy fun," making them comfortable, not feeling any difficulty, and also "gaining nothing." If you want to find examples, please pay attention to the long serial novels in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Wuai's article only explains the difficulties and jokes that a Chinese person with no language education and a simple mind encounters when using nouns, verbs, adverbs, and various clauses, which has nothing to do with "corruption and abuse."</p>
<p>If we do not want our culture to forever remain at the stage of children's games and childishness, let us hope that every writer reaches the realm of profundity and novelty, we have been ordinary readers for long enough.</p>
<h3>In the Carriage</h3>
<p>— Yao Mu</p>
<p>—Random Jottings from the Mundane World, No. 2—</p>
<p>Friend,</p>
<p>I trust you have received my first letter? "Is it a dream or madness?" you might be thinking, my friend. But understand, one newly awakened from a nightmare, his murmurings are at least akin to nonsensical ramblings!</p>
<p>I am now comfortably seated in a first-class carriage. I am still my free self—free as Sun Wukong returning to the Water Curtain Cave after Tang Sanzang was eaten by demons and the group temporarily disbanded. After rubbing my drowsy eyes several times, I can pick out some true and real things I have seen and heard along the way to tell you.</p>
<p>After sleeping soundly through the night, the scenery along the way has changed to the flavor of the north. —The dry plains of Guanghan, the hot wind blowing yellow dust, the incomplete houses leaning east and west, the burly, swarthy farmers in the fields, bare-chested. I have already traveled this road a few times, and this time I feel even more bored and monotonous. The lush green grass of the south, the gentle, charming waves of ponds or streams, are of course nowhere to be seen here, and a picture of severe drought is vividly presented before people's eyes. Some wheat has already turned yellow and formed kernels, but it is short, less than a foot tall; worse, it is faintly yellowish, weak and withered like autumn grass. But the sound of the orange stalks, the shadow of the waterwheel pavilion, are very rare. The drought in the north seems to be even more thorough than in the south.</p>
<p>When the train arrived in Tai'an, a passenger joined me in my compartment, an old man in his sixties. His deep purple-brown face, his bushy white beard, and his bright eyes, his forehead engraved with three deep wrinkles like that of the God of Longevity, were particularly attractive to me. Thinking positively, I felt he was a quaint figure from a Song or Yuan painting; thinking negatively, I saw a typical country bumpkin landlord before me. As soon as he came in, he cupped his hands to the tea attendant, cupped his hands to the ticket inspector, and cupped his hands respectfully to me. I had to greet him. After exchanging names as a matter of routine, I caught a glimpse of his rough, wrinkled hands covered in mud—I thought of a topic for conversation.</p>
<p>"Old gentleman, it probably hasn't rained here for a long time?"</p>
<p>"You can tell by looking at the wheat along the way." He puffed out his white beard, fanned himself with a paper fan printed with stone-printed calligraphy and paintings, and continued in a lively, merchant-like tone: "There hasn't been much rain since spring this year. It's been windy for the past month. Digging wells? After digging several fathoms, you still can't see a drop of water. People in the countryside have to travel dozens of miles to fetch a bucket of water. ... Is there a shortage of rain in the south too?" He turned to ask me.</p>
<p>"I heard that Jiangsu and Hubei are also suffering from drought."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's terrible. I went to Xinyangzhou in previous years, and the wheat there was half a person tall, lush green and lovely, not worried about a shortage of rain. We really don't know what we've done to offend the heavens! Moreover, if there are strong winds in the spring, there will definitely be floods in May and June. I've lived for over sixty years and experienced a lot, you wait and see!"</p>
<p>Although his words had a bit of a "crocodile tears" feel to them, I believed that his prediction would unfortunately come true.</p>
<p>After the train passed Jinan, my companion in the carriage was replaced by a middle-aged man, although also a rural landlord, but belonging to another type. He wore a set of blue silk casual clothes, tall and big, even larger than the average northerner: but all he had now was a coarse skeleton covered with a layer of skin, without much muscle. His forehead and cheekbones were sunken, and his skin was dull yellow, like a giant beast starving in a zoo. After he got on the train, he kept smoking cigarettes, occasionally chatting with me in a bland manner.</p>
<p>When I lay on the bunk after lunch, closing my eyes to prepare for a nap, my companion closed the door of the compartment. I opened my eyes and glimpsed him taking something out of his bag. I stared intently, and it turned out to be a hypodermic needle. My curiosity was piqued, and I kept my eyes half-closed, secretly watching what he was doing. He wiped the hypodermic needle with cotton a few times like a doctor, then turned his back to me, pulled up his trouser leg, and made a gesture of injecting his calf. After rubbing his leg for a while, he lightly wiped the hypodermic needle and hid it back in his bag.</p>
<p>"Is this the so-called morphine injection?" This time I had my eyes opened; no wonder this giant was just an empty shell of skin and bones. I thought to myself, but I was still a little skeptical. Later, I carefully watched him, and the many vaguely visible black spots on his arms and legs proved that my guess was correct.</p>
<p>Friend, what I told you last time was indeed just some trivial matters, but for you who have been away from your homeland for many years, it should still have some meaning, right? I'm about to arrive at my destination, I'll tell you more next time!</p>
<h3>Every Time I Come Back</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Dusk descends, and as the factory whistle wails like a demon, I am liberated from the gloomy, oil-smelling, suffocating factory. After a whole day of overwork, I now have the right to breathe a mouthful of fresh air. Under the free sky, I stretch my limbs, exhale a long breath, and stagger back to my home.</p>
<p>When I get home, my father is still squatting on the broken-legged stool, just like yesterday, his thick eyebrows furrowed, casting a lazy glance at me with his painful, melancholic eyes. This seems like a greeting, but it also expresses some kind of request from my father. At this moment, with this tired and sorrowful heart, I nod my head silently to him, and then go straight to the corner of the room. I do this deliberately, because I dare not approach my father's side. Whenever my father sees me near him, he starts a long stream of nagging words that make me very uncomfortable. Especially when my father asks me for money to buy wine and I don't have a single penny to give him, my father immediately puts on a stern face and scolds me harshly. I know my father's temper. Since he lost his job, he likes to drink, and his personality has completely changed. Now, he spends his days either wandering the streets or sulking at home, and therefore often makes things difficult for us. But we understand the inner pain that has led to this sad behavior of my father. So we not only do not dislike him, nor do we have any hateful thoughts towards his bad behavior.</p>
<p>At night, when all the family members are sleeping soundly, my father quietly gets up alone. He can never sleep soundly—ever since he lost his job. In the pitch-black night, he gropes around like a cat. He knocks things over, making a loud crashing noise that awakens us. My mother often argues with my father because of this. She is very distressed and heartbroken, because both my mother and father are getting old, and like me, she has to work hard during the day and wants to rest well at night; otherwise, we will be kicked out by life. But often, when we are drifting into sleep, my father's stomach can't bear the hunger pangs anymore. After losing his job, I don't know why, but my father's stomach seems to have grown bigger, and his appetite is stronger. In short, besides feeling desolate, what else can we say about my father's unavoidable and disturbing actions? You must know: we are people living in poverty. Besides two meals a day of coarse food that can barely fill us up, we have almost nothing tasty to put in our mouths. So, there is a reason why my father is like that.</p>
<p>In the past, when he had a job, my father was different from now. He would get up early and tidy up the household items, arranging everything neatly, before going to work calmly. At the factory, he was very "well-behaved" and worked diligently. So he was once praised by the foreman. In the evening, when he came back, as long as he had money, my father would definitely buy some peanuts or the like for my younger siblings to eat. Sometimes he could patiently tell them some jokes and strange news he had heard from others. In short, at that time, my father was a gentle person, lived a very disciplined life, and was clearly a happy and careful person. So at that time, as long as we were all together, we would chat and laugh, and life seemed very happy.</p>
<p>But this joy seemed to have no connection with us, and it quickly left us and went far away. I feel that only melancholy and distress are the true companions of us poor people. It follows us closely at all times, as if our soul is in our body.</p>
<p>Counting from the time my father was laid off due to old age until now, it has been more than three years. Time passes by boringly, minute by minute, day by day, month by month, year by year, and my father is still idle, spending his days and nights in a kind of painful life. We don't know how to help my father pass these difficult and long years.</p>
<p>Soon, my mother also suffered the same misfortune. As such, our family was plunged into even greater misery and poverty. Whenever I come back from the factory, a kind of human pain assaults my heart. My father and mother often quarrel and fight over meals. Seeing this unfortunate life, I have no heart for life anymore. How can we end these days? For the disasters that are approaching us day by day, for this seemingly endless oppression, for us people living in such an environment, I deeply feel as if a sharp blade is inserted into my flesh and not pulled out, the pain is so intense.</p>
<p>My father is obviously much older than before, and his physique is also very hunched. A kind of gray death has shrouded his pale and haggard face. My mother, too, is sick and vomiting blood because of being angered by my father. Her difficult cough, her intermittent voice, her gloomy face filled with misfortune, her unavoidable shadow of death... My heart is simply broken, every time I come back from the factory.</p>
<h3>Street Lamp</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>Night, squeezing out the blackness of ink,</p>
<p>Surrounding gloom,</p>
<p>Like being immersed in an ice cellar.</p>
<p>Northwest wind blowing strands of cold,</p>
<p>Do you, feel startled?</p>
<p>A demonic shadow seems stuck to your back,</p>
<p>Tightly and tightly;</p>
<p>Sudden steps cannot dispel fear,</p>
<p>Your heart seems about to leap out from the corner of your mouth.</p>
<p>In the sky, neither full nor crescent moons,</p>
<p>Occupying are those things twitching small eyes,</p>
<p>Those things laughing at your baseness,</p>
<p>You, roll into a cage of terror,</p>
<p>Unable to hear its breath,</p>
<p>Only complaining about this rugged path!</p>
<p>Walking on and on,</p>
<p>The demonic shadow never leaves your back,</p>
<p>Small eyes still laughing,</p>
<p>You are infuriated, your feet empty—run!</p>
<p>Drilling out of the dark path,</p>
<p>A bit of light scatters at the road corner to the right,</p>
<p>Ah! Should you celebrate this?</p>
<p>And widen your tired eyes,</p>
<p>Indulgently scanning:</p>
<p>The light kills the demonic shadow,</p>
<p>Takes away the smile of the small eyes,</p>
<p>Even hammers to death your terror,</p>
<p>Friend, how should you celebrate?</p>
<h3>College Days (2)</h3>
<p>— By German author, Storm, translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>Fritz and I, we both immediately agreed to invite Lena Li, Du Lijia to be the eighth female dance partner. We naturally encountered some difficulties: because when we brought out our suggestion, those little girls and noble ladies all put on serious faces and remained silent. But the mayor's beloved son did have the ability, and pulled the mayor's wife to our side; in front of this clear-headed lady's straightforward and decisive character, those girls' frowns and her mother's obvious opposition—this was even more fierce—were all powerless.</p>
<p>So one afternoon we walked towards the French tailor's house. —I often regret that I broke off with the son of the carpenter who did business for my family, his sister almost came and went with little Bo Lijia girl every day: I also very much wanted to restore this friendship, and go to his father's workshop to learn carpentry; because Christopher was still a young man with self-esteem, and his mind was not simple, but he especially hated middle school students, he called them "Latins" in a disgusted tone; he often gathered a group of friends with the same aspirations on the sports field to fight those "Latins" recklessly, no matter how many times they fought, this war would not end.</p>
<p>But now I don't need that kind of introduction: because we have come to the front of the house, stepped on the yellow leaves of the linden tree that fell in the autumn wind, and walked to the low doorway. At the sound of the doorbell, Mrs. Bo Lijia came out from the kitchen to greet us; after wiping her hands on her white apron, she invited us into the small living room.</p>
<p>It is not obvious that this short, plump woman with golden hair would give birth to such a gentle and lovely black-haired girl. When we came in, this girl was putting down her work and standing up, leaning against the money counter with a feeling of half curiosity and half shyness.</p>
<p>When Fritz said our invitation, a red cloud appeared on her face, and I saw her eyes shine and open wide; but when her mother heard it and did not respond, and showed a thoughtful look and shook her head, she gently slipped behind her mother and walked out from the door that seemed to lead to the bedroom.</p>
<p>I glanced at the table she was sitting next to when she greeted us. Among the pieces of cloth and other little girl's things was a pair of Latin cloth shoes, even the edges were done, it seemed that she was just doing this thing. This pair of shoes was extremely small, and my childhood fantasy couldn't help but remind me of the pair of small feet that wore these shoes; in my mind, I seemed to see that pair of small feet already crossing with my feet in dancing, and I still wanted to ask her to stand for a while, but those feet stopped for a while, and moved for a while, constantly teasing me.</p>
<p>While my mind was dreaming these phantoms, Mrs. Bo Lijia was starting to ask my friend—I naturally pushed him to speak—to argue with each other, until later the mayor's wife's name was mentioned, this argument gradually inclined to our side.</p>

<h3>Three Solutions Proposed for Youth Problems</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>To be born as a youth in this turbulent era is truly unfortunate! Youth is originally optimistic, promising, and progressive. But now it is not like this. Today's youth is often tightly pressed by many worries and cannot help but feel the hardship of life, presenting bewilderment, regret, and despair!</p>
<p>Modern youth urgently need to solve many problems, and these three are the most important: academics, love, and career. These three personal issues not only put ordinary youth in a distressed situation, but sometimes even force them to commit suicide! The newspapers a few days ago reported a news item about a young man who committed suicide by taking poison because his parents refused to allow him to continue his studies. Recently, another case occurred of a university student committing suicide by throwing himself into the river due to a broken heart. This is regarding academics and love. As for those who sacrifice their lives due to unemployment, they are even more numerous!</p>
<p>Youth problems are overall social problems, not individual problems of youth. This is easy to understand. For example, the unemployment problem, which from the surface seems to be an individual problem, is actually a social problem. Because the current inability of a group of youth to find a way out, a sluggish society is the biggest reason. Therefore, the unemployment problem of youth is also an overall social problem. Therefore, some people advocate that youth problems cannot be solved alone. Youth problems can only be solved when overall social problems are solved. This is correct.</p>
<p>However, solving overall social problems is ultimately an extremely difficult task. At least in the near future, there is no way to start. So what should we do? Put the youth problem aside for the time being? If this is the case, we can only watch a group of youth, one by one, take the dangerous road! This is absolutely unacceptable. Before the overall social problems can be solved, the youth problem really has the need to be solved as an individual problem. Such a solution may not be thorough, but it is urgent!</p>
<p>What are the methods to solve youth problems alone? This can be divided into three aspects.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about academic problems. We admit that academics are very important to youth. But we must understand that the current education system in our country cannot give every youth an equal opportunity to study. Therefore, it is really difficult for a poor youth to hope to be promoted from elementary school to middle school, or from middle school to university. But this doesn't matter. It must be known that knowledge is not necessarily obtained by entering school. Diligent self-study can also achieve the purpose of seeking knowledge. There are many erudite scholars in the world whose knowledge is not obtained through school education, but through their own hard work. Moreover, the current school education in our country is also very unreliable. Why should a youth be disappointed because he cannot enter school to study?</p>
<p>Second, let's take the love problem. Youth love is also necessary. But modern youth must not regard love as something sacred when talking about love. It must be known that the present is a world of money, everything is commodified, and love is no exception. A poor boy will be rejected everywhere when pursuing the opposite sex. Youth should be aware of this. So if you want to fall in love, success is best, and failure is not necessary to be discouraged. If you are rejected by this one, look for another. I am not looking at love as child's play, but it is really necessary to do so. Otherwise, you can only commit suicide, there is no second way to go!</p>
<p>Third, let's talk about career problems. A youth must have a career in order to live. But in this era of extreme social depression, there are more people than jobs, and it is not easy to find a job. Therefore, to solve the career problem, it is best for those who have jobs to be content with their jobs and not be fickle. Those who do not have jobs, as long as there is something to do, even if the position is low, they should condescend. The important thing is to choose a career, do not hold overly extravagant hopes. This will fail. Especially a part of the educated youth with considerable education should not regard themselves too highly and regard themselves as a special class. There is no high or low in occupations. Anything that benefits the people can be done! In case of unemployment, do not be discouraged. As long as you do not have extravagant ideas, work will definitely not reject you.</p>
<p>In short, a modern youth who wants to free himself from his own distress should have a clear understanding of the environmental era we are in. We must recognize that in this society we should not be at the mercy of the environment, we should overcome the environment. We must rise up our own strength to make up for all the defects of society. Because the progress of a society depends on the promotion of youth!</p>

<h3>Lamp (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Tan Tan</p>
<p>In the previous article, I wrote a little about my miscellaneous affairs with lamps. Below I will write more about the knowledge of lamps.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was probably only fire and no lamps. What is called "Chai" in the Book of Documents is not necessary to say? That is, when Liu Xiang checked the books, Tian Lu (?): with a brush made with the fire of artemisia as the lamp, climbing into the clouds, it was only fire and not lamps. In the Biography of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in the Records of the Grand Historian, "Chou Huo Hu Ming", although "Chou Huo" is also called "Chou Deng" by later generations, it is only a later type of lantern. I don't know which came first, candles or oil lamps. Even taking "burning the belly to be a lamp" as an example, I don't know if their "lamp" knew that oil could be used to light a lamp first. Later, seeing that the dead were fat, their stomachs must have a lot of oil, so they used them as lamps?</p>
<p>According to the theory, then oil lamps came before candles; because the completion of candles clearly knows that oil can light a lamp, and then condenses it to make a candle. But opening the ancient books, it clearly says that candles are mentioned more than lamps, and earlier than lamps. If you say that lamps are more aristocratic and used by fewer people, then solitary lamps and green lamps are clearly very shabby, while red candles and magnificent candles are so rich?</p>
<p>In the Book of Songs, "The torches in the courtyard began to shine", the torches used charcoal, not oil. When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty watched the ghost of Lady Li at night, I don't know if it was under the light of a lamp or under the light of a candle?</p>
<p>In Li Shangyin's poem, "Pearl floats, floating lamp returns alone", I don't know whether it uses candles or oil, meaning that the thing you hold while walking is mostly candles like the later lanterns and gauze lamps. "When should we cut the candles at the west window together!" "The wax torch turns to ashes, the tears begin to dry", in the Tang Dynasty, candles were probably more common. And "at dusk, the Han Palace passes candles", "painting short, suffering the night is long, why must you hold a candle to tour", at the end of the Dynasty, during the Eastern Han Dynasty, candles were undoubtedly already used.</p>
<p>Buddhist temples have lamps that are long-burning lamps, which use oil. Buddhism was introduced into China during the Eastern Han Dynasty. I don't know when the long-burning lamps were lit. Did they exist as soon as they were brought from India?</p>
<p>Lamps and candles are probably used interchangeably. Even if a candle is used, as long as a cover or something is added to the candle, people will also call it a lamp. It seems that gauze lamps and lanterns do not use candles, but it does not prevent them from being called lamps.</p>
<p>In the past, during the prosperous times, flower lanterns were often released on the night of the Lantern Festival, expressing the idea of ​​singing and dancing in peace. Especially the people of Jiangnan are accustomed to ingenuity, so the spring lamps in Wu and Yue and other places are unusually detailed. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, King Fu occupied Jiangnan. At that time, Qing soldiers were already approaching Jinling City, but the old gentleman was still in a leisurely mood and greatly appreciated the spring lamps in Nanjing City. "I heard that the city is full of artillery fire, and the deep palace is still appreciating spring lamps", this matter is forever lamented by historians. In fact, with this lamp story in history, the value of the lamp immediately increased a lot. Although its merit and power are in some places completely the same as the sun.</p>
<p>Naturally, modern cities are even more indispensable to lamps. If Shanghai has no lamps, there will be no Shanghai at night, and if there is no Shanghai at night, there will be no Shanghai.</p>
<p>Haters of material civilization hate everything new. In fact, this only shows their ignorance. Taking lamps as an example, the beautiful colors of the neon lamps beautify the city, let alone that, even ordinary electric lights will immediately bring you from the real world to a misty dreamland as long as you add a beautiful tassel cover on all four sides. "Ten thousand people under the lamp", it helps people to be charming, doesn't it?</p>
<p>"The moon sets, the birds cry, the frost fills the sky, the maple leaves are against the fishing fire, sleep with melancholy", "The tide falls, the night river is in the oblique moon, two or three points of fire are Guazhou", naturally, what I miss most is not the red lights of the city, not the silver candles in the halls, but a few fishing lights in the empty water of the river. But I haven't seen them for a long time?</p>
<h3>Garden and Forest</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>In summer, gardens and forests are lush and dense, with branches and leaves laden with fruit, constantly tempting passersby with umbrellas outside the garden. The wind carries the blazing heat of the midday sun through the shade of the trees. From time to time, a few clear bird calls scatter from the branches and leaves: the cicadas, as if unable to endure the sun's scorching heat, lie under the leaves, stretching their voices to the limit to drink. Longans are almost ripe and sweet, and children often sneak in from the garden walls to steal them, so someone has to guard them there: the guard is the grandfather, who sits under a green shade every afternoon, always waving a large cattail fan in his hand, lying on a bamboo chair, looking at the fruits on the branches, a smile on his face: the long beard, draped over his chest, occasionally sways gently with the fanning wind.</p>
<p>In the garden, there are more than twenty longan and pomelo trees in total, all planted by the grandfather himself, and there is also a lychee tree, squeezed between a longan and a pomelo tree, which the grandfather cherishes the most. After several years of hard work, the longan and pomelo trees began to bear a lot of fruit that year, and the grandfather was naturally very proud. At that time, I was about six years old. The sixth and seventh months of the lunar calendar in my hometown were the busy farming season, and the mothers had little time at home during the day, so I had to follow my grandfather with my older sister, and my grandfather certainly loved his grandchildren. The children in the countryside are naturally more wild, and although my sister was only two years older than me, she had already learned how to climb trees. Often, when my grandfather was taking a nap, my sister would use the excuse of catching cicadas to climb up the tree and pick some longans, and the two of us would share them behind my grandfather's back: the longans were not yet fully ripe. Although they tasted astringent, they still felt sweet and delicious. But every time, my grandfather would find out, and we would inevitably be scolded. However, my grandfather always loved us very much, and he would let us make trouble afterwards. Once, just after a heavy rain, the branches were slippery, and I encouraged my sister to climb the tree again. Unfortunately, this time it caused a disaster. My sister fell down, lying on the ground with blood flowing from her mouth. Although we unexpectedly got a handful of longans, my sister's two front teeth were broken.</p>
<p>By the beginning of July, most of the longans were gradually ripe and sweet. At this time, my grandfather no longer forbade us, and he would always pick a basket every day and share some with me and my sister. Children's desires are never satisfied, and when my grandfather wasn't paying attention, we still went to steal some. Because it was the first year of fruiting, the amount of fruit was limited, and it wasn't prepared to be picked and sold, but rather left on the trees to wait for the aunts to come back. The most interesting of the aunts were the second aunts, Wan and Mei. When the two of them were together, they always made a lot of jokes. Aunt Wan was famous for eating fruit, not afraid of sour or astringent, ripe or unripe, she ate them all with relish. As soon as Aunt Wan came, even the pomelos that were still far from ripe had to be picked a few. At that time, we always looked forward to our aunts coming back, so we could eat and eat a lot and make trouble with our aunts. My sister could also volunteer to climb the tree, and my grandfather wouldn't stop her anymore. My grandfather didn't like to eat longans (and didn't seem to eat other fruits much either), but when he saw us gathered under the tree eating wildly, he laughed happily.</p>
<p>That year, the garden was the most beautiful and lovely in my childhood life.</p>
<p>Now, my grandfather has long since passed away, and his tombstone has even turned brown: my own feet have stepped onto the road of life, bearing some tangible and intangible responsibilities as a person: my sister, too, has become the mother of two children: my aunts have changed even more quickly, not to mention the second aunts Wan and Mei, and the family of Aunt Kai, who was always considered well-off, has also declined in recent years. Although the garden is still there, and the longan and pomelo trees still bloom and bear fruit every year, the beautiful and lovely scene of happiness and joy from those days can never be woven back into the garden!</p>
<p>It is said that the lychee tree that my grandfather particularly cherished has never borne fruit even once until now. I think that if my grandfather knew about this in the afterlife, it would probably be something he wouldn't be happy about?</p>
<p>Alas, the garden in my memory, the dream of a happy childhood in the past, is now gone, gone.</p>
<h3>Sickness</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>I've been sick for over a month recently. It started with a headache. Of course, I didn't consider that the beginning of an illness. I took a dose of Tiger Head brand headache powder and continued to work as usual without paying attention. The next day, I developed a fever. The corners of my temples felt like they were on fire, and my palms and soles of my feet were also burning hot. This was definitely a sign of illness. I went home, boiled a dose of midday tea, and covered myself with a quilt to sleep. This was what my grandmother always reminded me to do as if it were a big deal. As long as I broke out in a sweat at night, the illness would suddenly disappear. When I woke up in the middle of the night, my body felt as if it had been dragged out of water. The next morning, I went back to work as usual, although I still felt dizzy and lightheaded, and I walked a bit unsteadily. It was the season of yellow plums. It is said that Southerners value "dampness." It was the time of damp toxins, and everyone had this phenomenon. In fact, the illness had officially begun. Three days later, my legs could no longer support my body from the bed.</p>
<p>Illness must be treated. The lives of poor people are sometimes perhaps more precious than those of the rich. With the help of my family, I went to a nearby hospital. The doctor, besides knowing that my pulse was higher than normal, said it was heat and gave me several colors of white medicine powder, with the words "take three times a day after meals" written on the paper package. This kind of diagnosis was probably the most thorough it could be.</p>
<p>I finished the six packets of medicine powder in two days, and I felt the same as before taking the medicine. My wife secretly invited a doctor for me. After a thorough examination, he came to the same conclusion: it was the flu. He wrote a prescription and instructed me to rest quietly. The cost was more than twenty times the hospital's registration fee, not including the cost of the medicine.</p>
<p>But perhaps the expensive doctor couldn't cure the poor man's illness. His medicine worsened my condition. I slept dazedly all day long, my body scorched by a high fever, but when it was time to light the lamps, I would wake up as if I were a normal person, and then I couldn't sleep until dawn. This situation lasted for a week. I changed three doctors, and my illness seemed to have become incurable. I could tell from their repeated head-shaking. When I was a child, I had the same kind of serious illness. I only knew that a strange doctor came to check my pulse every day, sometimes even two or three. The room was crowded with neighbors and relatives. Their whispers often made me angry for no reason. My mother stayed by my bedside all day long, with tears in her eyes, as if someone was going to take me away. But I was completely blank, and when I woke up, I would think of many things I wanted to eat, and it was best to get them right away, even things like cigarettes that I had never put in my mouth before. This made the people who visited me anxious. They thought it was delirium. A twelve or thirteen-year-old child could never think of so many items. But when they were discussing it quietly, I could hear them clearly. This abnormal hearing also made them suspicious. Later, I learned that my illness lasted for a year. Not a single licensed doctor was willing to come, and in the end, no one could diagnose the correct disease. This was very much in line with my personality. I often deliberately made people not understand me, even my closest friends. But this time I got sick, I completely changed my ways. I hoped that a doctor would cure my illness immediately, or even kill me with a dose of the opposite medicine. Because I was no longer a twelve or thirteen-year-old child, and my mother was no longer there to take care of me. Although my wife had taken my mother's place, those people who I used to hate for whispering were nowhere to be seen. Being able to change three doctors, my wife had probably exhausted her last resources. The world of the past and my mother's death were buried at the same time. In this month-long illness, I learned the secret of how to live in the present society. Although I always hoped to get out of bed, it was never a bad thing to gain a little more life experience. Thinking like this, my illness got better as it followed its natural course.</p>
<h3>Sisters-in-Law (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ling Zixi</p>
<p>It hasn't been long since Zhang Gen died, but since the end of the seventh-day memorial, his family has been arguing and fighting every two or three days. Even the neighbors on the left and right went from talking about it to disliking it, from disliking it to hating it, and later on, it was even a little alarming - constantly arguing from early in the morning until late at night; fighting, scolding, crying and shouting. They were also making trouble by hanging themselves or jumping into the river to commit suicide. The noise made people feel uneasy, and they themselves were only concerned with arguing and scheming, trying to gain a little secret advantage and verbal "glory." Like this, who wouldn't hate it, who wouldn't hope for a little peace?</p>
<p>However, Zhang Gen's family was still making trouble "every two or three days."</p>
<p>As a result, the people in the village often made the two "quarrelers" in Zhang Gen's family the object of their comments and the source of their idle talk in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>"They're arguing like enemies, when will it ever stop?"</p>
<p>"Stop? You don't understand at all! When Zhang Gen's wife came through the door, the Taoist Wang in the town secretly said to people: Zhang Gen's mother and sister are both born in the year of the Tiger, and the bride is born in the year of the Sheep. A sheep entering a tiger's mouth will suffer."</p>
<p>"That's right! A sheep entering a tiger's mouth, their fates are incompatible. Don't you know?"</p>
<p>"But I say, Zhang Gen's mother has lived a long time. How can she not understand a little! It's common for a daughter-in-law and a sister-in-law not to get along. But the mother-in-law doesn't try to reconcile them. Instead, she adds fuel to the fire, joining her daughter in tormenting the widowed daughter-in-law. Every day, from early in the morning, she complains and curses. Is that how things should be done?"</p>
<p>"Their fates are incompatible - after all, the daughter is family, blood relatives, think about it, who wouldn't help their own family, who wouldn't help their daughter instead of the widowed daughter-in-law?"</p>
