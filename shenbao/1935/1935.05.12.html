<h3 id="c51">聶育夫之人工修治黃河說 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>黃河自古為北方之大患。河工亦為歷代以來之弊藪。惟其為大患。故治之者專且勤治河之法。沿用迄今。雖以時代不同。科學昌明及技述進步之結果。要亦不過斟酌損益於其間耳。又惟其為弊藪。故歷來以河工為美差。藉歲修之名行其侵占自肥之實。因是辦理工程者。不求其堅固。搶修堵口者。不求其速成時坍時修。正為生財之有道。而河工乃不可問。河患亦無安瀾之日矣。</p>
<p>夫行水以利為本。因乎地。乘乎時。而大利興焉。但尤必有其法。得其人。否則。工非實在。帑盡虛糜。利未見而弊滋甚耳。不觀夫貫台決口。初時工久難成。其後不匝月而合龍乎。事權統一。經費集中。施工易而稽察便。其收效自速也。</p>
<p>此次國聯派遣考察水利專家聶育夫氏來華。經其視察黃河之結果。對以前若干水利專家考察黃河水利。輒言需欵幾萬萬元以購機器。認為含有兜售機械作用。並非為中國本身著想。而謂「開發黃河水利。以及預防水患。不必盡賴機械。鋤犂亦可為之。中國農民勤儉異常。用人工開鑿。已可預防水患。灌溉兩岸田地。」又謂「幾萬萬鉅欵。在社會經濟極恐慌之際。恐一時無法籌集。面黃河水利。不能因籌疑困難而遲緩也。」吾人旣戚歷來號稱「外國專家」來華考察之結果。皆無聶氏認識之眞切。又欽聶氏謀事以忠。處事以信之精神誠哉不可多得。但吾人不為其不需機器而以鋤犂治河而歌謳之。乃為其不護短。不自固能從中國現代之所需要。之所能行者而規畫之也。一般來華外人。有能蠲除其自利之心。不為其祖國工商業暗中效其忠悃。謀其利益者乎。彼等欲推銷其治河機器。則日非籌數萬萬元以購機器不可。另易一事則又日非籌數萬萬元以購其材料不可。誠如此。我國多興一事業。郎為外國多一筆收入。外貨亦多一筆銷路。假如所購機器而不能運用之。或用之而不能盡其功。則簡直為朽銅爛鐵耳。然彼策劃者旣售其術。早挾我數萬萬金錢遨遊海外。我則徒喚奈何而莫可如何。故聶氏能道破此著。自非挾皮包說大話者可比。又非具有大公無私之精神。不能出此。吾人焉得不致其欽遲哉。</p>
<p>不用機器以治河。而用人工。此其為言。非開倒車之謂也。歐美人固受機器之宏惠。而所受機器之苦痛。至今亦日漸深刻。蓋一機器之能力。恒抵數十人數百人而有餘。機械之使用愈發達。人工之被剝奪亦愈衆。於是無法處置之失業問題成為歐美當前之最大難關。我國為不善使用機器。而飽受使用機器者之壓迫。痛苦亦至不堪言狀。此事實也。為自拔之說者欲廣置機器。以救貧弱。說亦近似也。然於歐美人今日所受之苦痛。我人亦應預事防杜之。中國不善用機器。勞力已陷於過剩。若機器一發達。雖曰惟用機器。期勞力為貴。但如可以不用機器而能收效者。仍以多用人工為宜。為其所得縱少。而多少有工可作。有飯可吃。是亦目前維護民生之要著也故河工旣可以人工收效正不必再用機器卽在古時　河濬渠亦多利用農隙。蓋治水者治田也。水得其利而田亦以關。農田之於水利。農夫之於濬河固有其密切之關係。因以見聶氏所言正為切合中國之現狀。不容以一般客卿相目也。今聶氏行矣。深望其能有詳盡切實之規　。以為我治河之助。他日共慶安瀾。聶氏之功豈可沒哉。</p>

<p>陝西物產之槪況</p>
<p>陝西物產、關中漢中兩區、十地肥沃、以農林產品爲多、陝北區地曠人稀、煤汕皮毛等產、更所在多有、各縣食糧產最、據建廳廿二年調查、以小麥爲最多、占總產景百分之四十八强、計一百三十萬餘石、次爲豆類。大麥·稻、及其他雜糧等、計亦一百三十餘萬石、南鄭所產香米黑米、淸香有味、長安王曲鎭所產熟大米、煮熟能漲飯三倍、可稱農作特產、同年植棉棉田、據有調查之三十七縣、祇占全耕地百分之九强、另據經委會棉業統制會發表、去年（廿三年）陝西一省棉田之增加、比較前年（廿二年）高達百分之八十、共計收穫棉花一百萬零四千餘擔、較前年增加百分之九十五洛惠區士地、尙較肥於涇惠區、他日洛惠渠完工、種烟禁絕、農作品中、尤其棉花產量之激增、必更大有可觀、惟陝省雖產棉豐富、惜無一紡織工廠、就地利用優良原料、間有手工所織土布、亦皆睪守陳法、致原料賤值輸出、外貨棉布輸入暢銷、而本省人民、反以高價用忍受剪刀式之經濟剝削、其害何可勝　、聞籌辦陝省紗廠之議、已有三四十年之歷史、其間曾發生籌辦人捲逃股欽之事、致旋倡旋輟、前年又有鉅商數人、擬集股籌辦、並已定名爲裕泰紡紗廠、甚盼能早臼實現、又陝省每一惠渠興工、恒有當地有力者以重價爭買田地、而新舊地主、更借故抬高租額、使許多被重價引誘或受經濟壓迫之中小農、脫售土地之後、雖欲求爲佃農而不可得、且銀行貸欵、赤貧小農難以直接、往往輾轉貸得、一轉手間利率己無形增高、此則不無遺憾也、</p>
<p>陝省林產、如梨棗桃杏葡萄等菜樹、各地多有之、又如松柏榆懈胡桃等木材林、則盛產於秦嶺及巴山、中有特產漆樹、年可出漆十萬餘斤、值價十三萬餘元、桐樹出油十六萬餘斤值六萬餘元、兩項共值二十萬元左右、實爲漢中區各縣之一大收入、各地森林梨園附產木耳、爲製饌佳品、每年輸出百五十萬斤以上、木耳菌類、生於朽木、色分褐黑或黃白、種植方法、截木爲段、橫置陰處、不項施肥、朋一年卽生無耳、產至三年爲度、再產卽變紅黃色、乾後香如桂花、一名桂花耳、價較黑耳爲昂、若更由黑耳天然　爲白耳、亦稱銀耳、每斤竟責至數十元不等、惟一度產生銀耳之後、次年卽不再生、陝南漢江一帶、尙多養蠶、曩年運銷川甘兩省、年達七八十萬元、長安大荔洛川宜川等縣、亦間有養者、</p>
<p>鑛產首堪稱述者爲石油、確區分布於延長膚施中部宜君葭縣米脂等縣、油泉先後湧現者、達四五十處、多自石岩流出、或由溝底河邊湧浮於水面、若露珠然、漢唐時居民已有用以療病燃火者、淸季在延長設廠開辦、迄今垂三十年、祇以資少機劣、未著大效、近年間每月平均所產油量、計十六年度（每月）爲七·二〇〇斤、十七年度一·〇一六斤、十八年度二九·二〇七斤、十九年度一五·二〇七斤，二十年度九·三八五斤、廿一年度七·〇一三斤、廿二年度六·〇九八斤、中以十八十九兩年產量較豐、廿一二年度忽出油漸少、國防設計委員會新以資本十萬元經營之、產量聞又較增、前途殊有希望、今春提倡民族掃墓、咸榆公路趕築至黃陵所在之中部縣、不不久將通至延長、礦務想能因交通之便、籌設大規模油廠、購置新機、使增加產量、提煉良品、以解决西北燃料問題、並供及汽車等工業器之使用焉、煤礦陝南北均產之、中以韓城同官所產爲上選、韓城皚子山者且爲無烟煤、倘能敷設輕便鐵路、或整理黃河水道、運至潼關、俾與隴海路啣接、東西一往無阻、誠不難與開棄中與並駕齊驅、鐵礦則產於藍田鎭安耀縣鳳城韓城實鷄安康留灞等縣、中以鎭安鐵洞溝者尤佳、礦區隨山綿延約數十里、礦石係零星塊狀、土人開採設有煉爐、每日可出熟鐵千餘斤、他如藍田玉、洵陽鉛銅、南鄭砂金、商縣石棉、秦嶺翡翠、略陽汞及嘉魚石、鄜縣及熊耳山銀鑛、崤山碧玉水晶、同官磁釉陶土、南鄭及安康化石、更不勝枚舉、惜多未開發、</p>
<p>陝省北部各縣、素產皮毛、而製裘一業、以大荔爲盛、大荔舊係同州府治、西北各省所產羊皮、皆集中於此、硝製成裘、質輕毛軟、卽世所調之同州皮貨、年產約十萬張左右、營業達七八十萬元、今因銷路不暢、已難同日而語、他如榆林膚施定邊等縣、年出虎豹狼狐等皮料、及馬鞍·駝件·等物、總值六七萬元、長安皮革·皮鞋·皮帶·馬鞍·等出品、年值五萬餘元、乾縣渭南等縣、年出皮繩約二萬餘斤、值一萬餘元、蒲城淳化年出皮料、六萬元左右、此外長安白水扶風橫山三原榆林耀縣等、所出織絨·彩毡·栽絨毯·毛口袋·等毛織物、總值十四五萬元、以上各項皮毛製品、前銷平津、轉運關外、每年出產總值約達百萬元、自九一八事變後、平津各埠銷路滯塞、因之皮毛製織品、遂日漸衰縮矣、</p>
<p>陝北區地質氣候頗與內蒙近似、原甚宜於牧業、今不但無足稱述、甚且全省農用牲畜、亦已日感缺乏、據建廳調查統計、　、各縣農用牲畜、牛馬馿三種、應需數　爲三六五·一〇七頭、實有牲畜總數僅二一〇·二五五頭、缺乏牲畜數達一五四·三八一頭、被調查之縣份計三十七應需牲畜恰可數用者僅二縣、餘三十五縣平均每縣所缺牲畜、多至四千四百十餘頭、其於農作之影響、不難揣測而得、今省府已籌設畜牧塲牧馬塲各一所、并請實部派專家前往指導、此事極關重要、尤其陝北各縣地曠人稀、向稱難治、今省府提倡牧畜、增加農民生產、卽所以安定社會、計莫善於此也、</p>
<p>陝省雖爲周泰歷代帝都所在、而地利未盡開發、益以十五年至十八九年之兵匪，旱災、各縣人口爲之大减、陝北區自膚施以北之縣份、往往方數百里之幅員、而人口總數祇三四萬人、多亦鮮有逾五六萬者、卽陝南之漢水流域、雖云山川風物、不减江南、物產富庶、可比川省、（漢中昔屬四川、因陝北比較苦寒、尤其榆林一帶、夏熱如焚、冬寒徹骨、風沙荒野、近似沙漠地、分省時始將漢中劃屬於陝、以資調劑）、但人口分佈密度、究較東南各省爲稀、而荒地之待墾殖、礦產之待開發、陝南陝北、各縣均有、據蒲城·郃陽·商縣·隴縣·邪縣·三原·鄂縣·藍田·朝邑·洋縣·留壩·膚施·中部·洛川·延長等十五縣、二十二年官公私荒地面積之調查、總計達五十八萬八千二百四十七畝、其他未經調查者、不知尙有凡幾、而各處荒地所在、大都爲地方貧瘠、民生痛苦、而天然富源又最優厚之地帶、政府如能以誠意實力、移民墾荒、助以資力、假以時日、豐收歸彼自用荒歉政府維持、不但失耕失業之人民必將一唱百和、聯袂以赴、卽開發西北、鞏固邊防之實際問題、亦將解决過半矣、</p>

<p>補選五人均加錄取</p>
<p>上海中華田徑賽委員會、因羅滬王季淮張嘉夔符保盧陳嘉佑五人、曾有良好成績、在預選會時因故未克出塲、特於昨日下午在申園舉行試賽、上列五人均依時到塲、表演各個技能、因無人競爭、致成績平平、當由委員會討論尙屬合格、均予錄取、充任本屆國際運動會代表、茲將五人成績列佐、</p>
<p>羅潛　鐵餅　三三·五九公尺</p>
<p>張嘉夔　三級跳　十三·四六公尺</p>
<p>王季淮　跳遠　六·三九公尺</p>
<p>符保盧　撑竿跳　三·五五公尺</p>
<p>陳嘉佑　高欄　十八秒</p>
<p>保膚與王禾　合演撑竿跳</p>
<p>昨日撑竿跳原祗符保盧人、正式表演、臨時由前日預選會中獲得跳遠三級撑竿高第　之王禾、培同表演、以增與趣、由三米起跳、絡續增至三米五五、王禾在第三次已跳過、保盧在第四次方一躍而過、加至三米六十、王符俱以體力不繼、不能躍過、</p>
<p>張嘉夔三級　王季淮跳速</p>
<p>張嘉夔之三級跳、第一跳卽有十二·四六公尺成績、第跳退至十三·二九、終以一人跑跳、不惟一無休息時間且無競爭與趣、即以三跳而止、王季淮跳遠、小心太過、脚未及板、即行起跳、殊於成績吃虧不少、連續十餘次、俱踏進半脚、甚爲可惜、跨步當然難以準確、結果以六·三九公尺紀錄在卷、王禾昨亦臨時陪跳、雖無正式紀錄、測其遠近、亦屬不差、</p>
<p>陳嘉佑高　　與羅潛鐵餅</p>
<p>陳嘉佑昨左腿抽筋、起跑前幾乎步一讀、百公尺跑來成續平平、嗣捨去二百公尺、再跑百十公尺高欄、僅人起步、成績却爲十八秒、起步時速率跨步、俱極佳妙、在第四攔時、不幸擦着些評、帶落欄、經此波折、跨步準度、當受影響、致第九欄亦不幸帶倒、否則成績當可進步、羅潛鐵餅、成績三三·五九公尺不及預選翁宮萬商之三三·七三八尺、</p>

<p>精神可佩</p>
<p>昨日七午九時各校學生已紛紛到齊、先行開會儀式、主席士德恒、報告後、由十一區教育會代表何介夫演說、旋即開始運動、田徑成績雖無可取、但各運動員俱係鄉間子女、其苦幹精神殊爲可侃、鄉區小學生大半無力製校服、故團體操時、雖服裝不一、但更可見其奮鬥之精神、昨因鎊稱不準、故男女乙丙組優勝運動員、尙須分別復鎊、給獎因時間不及、另行訂斯、</p>

<p>昨日會塲秩序由實騐小學童子軍維持、頗能盡職、旋以實小體育教員、以男子乙組跳高成績、名次之問發生爭執、向裁判員責問、雙方發生誤會、一時全塲童子軍舍棄本身職務、羣趨司令台、團團圍住、不肖份子並藉故發生　外行動、幸經　大實中主任陳科美當塲制止、未釀大禍、然此種不良現象之發生、該校教職員賓應負賣、蓋無論裁判員紀錄之錯誤與否、均不應由學生採取直接行動、且此輩小學生更不能使其　成不守運動道德之惡習慣也、各學校總分如下、</p>

<p>認此時此地的需要在爭取民族生存　反帝反封建爲建設過程中必然使命　對復古及全盤西化表示堅拒之決心</p>
<p>教授發表中國本位的文化建設宣言以來　數月間、影響及於全國、惟其間頗多誤解與懷　者、教授爰於最近發表總答覆誌之如左、本年一月十日、我們發表了一篇「中國本位的文化建設宣言、」同時並舉行研究性質的座談會製作徵詢表格、搜集重要文獻、公聞徵求論文、希望能從這些方面、得到一簡綜合的主　、資爲文化建設的指針、現因學術界　於　們抱着極熱烈的願望貢獻了不少有價值的意見、並　出許多值得注意的問題、特別是關於、何謂中國本位、二、何謂不守舊、三、何謂不盲從、四、中國本位和「中學爲體、西學爲用一有何不同、五、什麼是中國此時此地的需要、六、對於反帝反封建的態度怎樣等等、我們認爲有答覆　必要、在宣言中、我們曾由中國文化之史的發展去檢討西化東漸後中國文化動搖的原因、指陳以往種種運動失敗的徵結、主張今後的文化建設應以中國爲本位，並斷言中國此時此地的需要就是中國本位的基礎、這已明白指示我們所主張的中國本位、不是抱殘守　的因襲、不是生吞活剝的模仿、不是中體西用的凑合、而是以此時此地整個民族的需要和準備爲條件的創造、我們深信不同的時地、不會有完全相同的需要、閉關時代的中國和門戶洞開以後的中國、其需要固截然不同、處於侵略者地位的世界列强和處於被侵略者地位的中國、也有其不同的辦要、我們倘承認各時各地有各時各地的需要、那就應該肯定此時此地的中國自有其特殊的需要、應着這特殊需要而產生的文化、當然和閉關時代的中國文化或世界列强的文化不同、而我們所揭藥的中國本位文化建設、就應以這種特殊需要爲基礎、我們的信念是如此、所以我們所揭　的中國本位文化建設、在縱的方面不生張復古、在橫的方面反對全盤西化、在時間上重視此時的動問、在空間五重視此地的環境、熱切希望我們的文化建設能和此峙此地的需要相吻合、</p>
<p>又化和時地的需要既應合爲一致、文化的形態就應隨着時地的需要而變動而進展、復古的企圖不但造抱殘守闕、簡直是自覓死路、我們倘認現代的中國人不容冉營封建時代的生活、那就不應當持保守的熊度來阻止文化的演進、還必須扶着時代的大愉、努力踏上日新又日新的前程、唯其如此、我們的文化建設方針之一、應是不守舊、對於任何復古的企圖、都採排斥的熊度、我們敢說封建的殘骸、沒有可迷戀的現實價值、凡是重演歷史復活封建的作爲、都必歸於失敗、縱有偶然的成功、也只是一現的曇花、一閃的泡影、人們與其製造人工的黑夜、延長自己進化的過程、那就不如逕奔光明的前路、加速向上的發展、</p>
<p>爲了此時此地的需要、我們反對守舊、爲了比時此地的需要、我們亦反對盲從、我們深知文化不和時代的需要結合、固會發生時代的錯誤、文化不適應地域的條件、也會發生地域的齟齬、現代的中國人既不容迷戀過去的殘骸、也不容崇拜異地的偶像、外來文化果足爲我們營養的資料、自當儘量吸收、但必須根據此時此地的需要、加以一番審恤的選擇、倘竟不顧時地的條件、貿然主張全盤西化、豈但反客爲主、眞是自甘毀滅、况且西方現存文化的自身、也何嘗是個統一的　體、資本主義文化和社會主義文化的衝突、豈不就是西方文化自身的矛盾、所謂全盤承受、究竟承受什麼東西、是承受資本主義文化的全盤、是承受社會主義文化的全盤、還是承受資本主義文化與社會主義文化兩者的全盤、倘以爲在資本主義文化興社會主義文化中有一種其同的基礎或性質、可以全盤承受、殊不知每種文化各　其獨特的體系、資本主義文化與社會主義文化、旣建立在不同的社會關係上、其體系的任何部份自不能相同、敢問全盤西化論者從何化起、我們不僅反對守舊和盲從、就是所謂一中體西用」的主張、也在我們擯棄之列、中體西用論者以爲西方的物質文明有其可貴的地方、中國的精神文明地有可貴的地方、如果用中國的精神文明支配西方的物質文明、那就是最理想的凑合、拘着這柿見解的人、大抵是認物質質和精神之間有一不可踰越的鐵限、物質的進步和精神的進步、全　關係、西方的物質文明、沒有靈魂、中國的精神文明、沒有軀殼、所以　該把中國的精神文明和西方的物質文明、兩相湊合、砌成一體、其實不然、物質和精神是一個東西的兩方面、根本不能分離、我們不能說中國僅有精神的文明、亦不能說西方僅有物質的文明、說到體用、有什麼體便有什麼用、有什麼用必有什麼體、說什麼中體兩用、那簡直是不通、中國本位的文化建設、應以此時此地的需要爲基礎、無待煩言、中國此時此地的需要究竟是行麼、第一人民的生活需要充實、中國人民的生活非常貧之、物質方面不消說是不如人、精神生活、亦何　未富、蕭條的城市、枯窘的農村、是人民生活貧乏的反映、智識的缺乏、行動的凌亂、意氣的萎靡、感情的枯燥、也是人民生活破產的象徵、其次、國民的生計需要發展、對外買易和產業狀况是衝量國民生計的尺度、中國現在是貿易入超、產業落後、農村崩潰的國家、與民生計、怎能不力求發展、最後、民族的生存需要保障、鴉片戰爭以還、帝國主義的勢力、不斷侵入、從城　到鄉村、密佈　　了帝國主義束縛中國民族自由的綱羅、蠶食鯨吞下的中國領土、何止日蹙百里巧取豪奪下的中國主權、也早已痛切剝膚、加以經濟的榨取、沒有阻期、整個中國民族的血液行將枯竭、這更是當前的一個生死問題、總括起來、中國此時此地的需要就是、「充實人民的生活、發展國民的生計、爭取民族的生存、」故中國本位的文化建設是一種民族自信力的表現、一　積極的創造、而反帝反封建也就是這種創造過程中的必然使命、王新命·何炳松·武堉幹·孫寒冰·黃文山·陶希聖·章益·陳高傭·樊仲雲·薩孟武、</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>小朋友，今天是什麼節？我想知道的很少吧。要知今天是母親節。</p>
<p>我們從那兒來的？是從母親的胎裏出來的，母親吃了十多個月的苦，給你到人間的世界。從此母親是更辛苦了，時時留心我們，伊老人家一天到晚都是爲我們打算。</p>
<p>衣：春天到了，你的母親急急替你做單薄的衣服。冬天到了，又忙着替你做棉衣了。而你自己一些不想，你的衣服從那兒來的，都是你母親千針萬綫的結晶品，你穿在身上，還是不知足，以爲這太大，那太小，難道應該這樣嗎？</p>
<p>食：你母親總選好的東西給你吃，還要說肥肉不要吃，魚太腥氣，伊自己呢？吃些你吃剩下來的東西，你看見了，怎麼樣？</p>
<p>此外晚上睡的牀，摩登式，彈簧褥子。冬天，絲棉被，湯婆子。夏天，溫州蓆，珠羅紗帳，伊老人家愛護你們的心，多麼深刻呀！</p>
<p>母親是這樣的愛護我們，我們該怎樣的報德呢？是不是一些表面的儀式？不，决不，我們現在的責任是用功讀書，是唯一的報德的方法。</p>
<h3 id="c196">韓信的故事 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 涂紅霞</p>
<p>淮陰侯韓信，是帮助漢高祖劉邦的功臣。他在沒有得志的時候，是一個極貧苦無告的靑年，一直到現在，還有兩古蹟在淮安：</p>
<p>（一）胯下橋：在淮安城裏西南角，有一個地方，名呌胯下橋，當時韓信，還在貧賤，時常腰際掛刀外遊，一天，行經其地，許多無賴的少年，對他說：「韓信！你時常掛刀出來，你要是有本領，就拿出本領來和我們比一比，不然，你只好從我們胯下走過去!」韓信笑了一笑，低了頭從他們的胯下走過去，一般無賴，都哈哈大笑起來。</p>
<p>（二）釣魚台：韓信窮時，無以爲生，就在淮安西門外二里多路的小池塘邊釣魚，可是，每天都釣不到魚，幸虧有一個浣紗的漂母，時常給他飯吃，使他度過了艱難困苦的光陰，而成就了偉大的事業，所以：後來韓信做了高官，曾經拿千金以謝漂母，但是，漂母堅不肯受，至今還有漂母祠和漂母墓在淮安附近的地方，使後代的人都景仰伊哩！</p>

<p>小朋友們，今天又是星期日了。你們今天躱在家裏，幹些甚麼？</p>
<p>你們今天是不是還和平日一樣的那麼起身得很早麼？若是起身得遲了，那麼，你們該自己想：「早起和遲起，怎樣才合於衛生？」</p>
<p>早膳之後，是否打開書包來，把一星期中所讀的書，溫習溫習？星期日，是否應該溫習？還是應該不和書本接觸，盡情地玩，因爲星期日是一個休息的日子？</p>
<p>弟妹們在星期日，自然是愛和你胡鬧，和你吵嘴，和你打架。同學們在星期日，自然會來逗你踢皮球，打檯球，或是約你出去散步或遠足。鄰兒們在星期日，自然是來拉你去玩强盜山，演三本鐵公雞，或是滾銅板，打香烟牌子。在這幾種玩意兒之中，你們今天預備挑怎一種？</p>
<p>今天下午，假使你們的媽媽在打牌，那麼，你們預備怎麼消遣？若是你們的媽媽，怕你們要吵，而給了你們錢，那麼，你們預備到弄口的「一個銅板打頭彩」的攤子上去賭糖吃呢？還是塞進儲蓄盒去？</p>
<p>上面的幾個問題，都是今天的問題，而且都是很容易解答的。小朋友們，你們試答一下子。</p>

<p>— 慕良</p>
<p>前幾期在本刋登過一篇「不可不知道的事」後，現在還有幾件不可不知道的事來告訴給諸位小朋友聽：</p>
<p>丁抹國國旗創製於一千二百九十年，爲各國國旗之最古者。</p>
<p>世界上最大之花朶，生於蘇門答臘島上，形如車輪。</p>
<p>英京倫敦街道長二千六百英里，居民五百餘萬人。</p>
<p>西班牙京城，爲歐洲最高之城，築於離海面二千二百英尺以上之山巔上。</p>
<p>美國全國，共有大工廠二十七萬餘所。</p>
<p>非洲之尼羅河，爲世界產魚最多之河。</p>
<p>坎拿大之鐵路，橫貫美大陸，長三千餘英里；當俄國西伯利亞鐵路未成以前，此路實爲世界上第一之長綫。</p>
<p>鯨魚游泳之速率，每小時在十英里乃至二十英里之間。</p>
<p>光綫於一秒鐘間，能週行地球八轉。</p>
<h3 id="c200">科學先生變戲法 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>一根綫提起一杯水</p>
<p>科學先生又登台了。他右手裏拿着一隻玻璃杯子，杯子裏滿滿地盛着水。左手裏拿着一塊圓形的厚紙板—比杯口稍微大一點—和一根綫。對台下的小朋友說道：</p>
<p>「諸位小朋友，我們平常取水，或者用提桶，或者用面盆；今天我們不用這兩樣東西；單用這一根綫和這一塊厚紙板，要把這一杯水提起來。諸位之中，有誰能够辦得到麼」？</p>
<p>台下一個回答的聲音也沒有，大家覺得這是無論如何辦不到的。</p>
<p>「其實，只要懂得一點科學常識，這件事是非常容易的。現在，看我來做」。</p>
<p>他首先在厚紙板的中心，穿了一個小洞，再把那根綫穿過了那個洞：又從衣袋裏取出一個蠟燭頭，劃一根自來火，點着了，將蠟燭油澆在綫的上面，使它和紙板膠住，不致脫落。</p>
<p>這樣做好了之後，他把那厚紙板蓋住了杯口，用手指把四圍腰緊，不使有一點空隙，而讓空氣鑽得進去。這時，你看他慢慢地把綫伸直，慢慢地提起，哈哈！這裝滿着水，很有些重量的杯子，便懸掛在空中，很牢，很穩，而且沒有一滴水倒出來。</p>
<p>於是台下的小朋友都驚奇得呆住了。</p>
<p>「小朋友，你們知道這杯子爲什麼不會掉下來麼？原來在我們的上下，左右，前後，都有很大的空氣的重量壓着的。這種空氣壓着的力呌做大氣壓力。</p>
<p>『現在這杯子裏充滿着水，裏面的空氣就沒有了，上面又緊緊地蓋着原紙板，使杯外的空氣鑽不進去。因此只有紙板上面的空氣向下壓着，使厚紙板附牢在杯口，不能脫落；同時杯子下面的空氣也向上壓着，把杯子托住。這樣，杯子就被綫所吊住，懸掛在空中，而不會掉下來了。</p>
<p>『現在把杯子翻一個身，看這厚紙板會掉下來麼？—不，你們看，由於同樣的道理，牠也是不會掉下來的』。</p>
<h3 id="c201">緣木可以求魚 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 以德</p>
<p>小朋友！你看了這個題目，一定要奇怪起來。「緣木求魚」，是一句成語，比喻一件物的不可得的意思。因爲魚是在水裏的，緣木上去，怎麼可以得到呢？但是我要告訴你：「緣木可以求魚」。</p>
<p>有種魚，呌做「攀鱸」，產在印度，馬來等地方的淡水裏。它的鰭，生得特別硬。日夜住在水裏，覺得有些不開心的時候，它就要走到岸上來玩玩。它從水中到岸上來的時候，用臀鰭和腹鰭的棘，樑了地，用胸鰭爬行，好似走獸的用脚走路一般。雖然沒有走獸那麼走得輕快，但是它能從沙灘走上來，一步一步的，攀樑岸旁的蘆單，一直走到岸上的度草上。它在水中，和其他的魚一般，是用鰓呼吸的，到了岸上的時侯，它也有鰓的代替物，能呼吸空氣，並不感到困難；這也是所以使它可以安然上陸的原因之一了。</p>
<p>據一般人推測，它的硬鰭，既可當脚走路，爬上蘆草，假使河旁有大樹的話，使它爬上大樹，當然也是可能的。也許是河旁沒有大樹的緣故，可是還沒有人看見過它爬上大樹。否則，「緣木求魚」這句成語，倒變做寓實的話了。</p>
<h3 id="c202">攀鱸 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>

<p>— 顏鑫泉</p>
<p>小朋友！現在我來告訴你一個有趣的算題，在空閑的時候，不妨去問問你的兄弟姊妹或朋友看，或者他們是算不出的。</p>
<p>「一籃烏龜一擔鴨，頭祗四十九，腳有一百隻，幾隻烏龜幾隻鴨？」</p>
<p>不過還得和他說明：烏龜有四隻脚鴨祇有兩隻脚呢！說過，等他去推算；價使眞算不出來，那麼才將答題告訴他。</p>
<p>答題：一隻烏龜，四十八隻鴨。</p>
<h3 id="c205">動物鎖話 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>獅子自古稱爲百獸之王，其形似長毛獅子狗，體的構造，最適於捕食他獸，齒有鬥齒犬齒臼齒三種，犬齒臼齒非常銳利，無論什麼東西，一進了口，就會咬得粉碎。脚與貓相同，感覺很靈敏。雄獅與雌獅，形狀大不同，雄獅有蠶毛，姿容雄壯，毛為黃褐色，產於非洲東部與亞洲西南部的砂漢地方，所以毛色與砂漢的色相像的。大概動物都有一種保護色，虎豹黃地黑紋，與森林的草葉類似，自狐白熊爲純白色，與雪地冰原的色類似。這是天然給它們的防敵，與餌食的好處。小獅初生時，與貓狗相同，經過三天就會開眼，全身有黑的斑點，背中有黑色縞紋，好像虎豹樣子，長成後黑色的縞紋斑點，漸漸消滅。小獅生後，吃二個月乳，就會食肉，過了半年，就跟着母獅，到外邊去捕獸。攻擊他獸方法，往往勇猛的飛躍到獸的身上，把頸部咬殺，食後必要飮水，每天朝夕，大飲一次，如被它咬死的獸，一次吃不盡的時候，那未銜到適當的地方，用木葉枯草遮蓋殘骸上面，預防爲他獸所見，下次冉可以來吃的。白天隱眠巢窟中，到了太陽落後，就出來活動。吠聲甚大，百獸聽到其聲，都要發抖，常常伴了五六匹獅羣，爬到砂漢地方的岩石上面大吼，吼時震天動地，百獸聽到它的吼聲，以爲獅將來害，都東跑西逃了。我們如在途中遇到獅子，不要着急，因爲獅子不會隨便的來咬我們，它如東看西望的走着，那未必定是走到同伴的地方去的。可是飢餓時，或跟了小獅子的雌獅，那就有性命之憂了。非洲東部烏庚達地方，當建築鐵路的時候，工人們常常爲獅子所害，有一位派泰松上校，他從印度帶了三千名工人沿了路線，張起天幕來居住，不料附近有二匹獅子，嗅到有人的氣味，每夜到天幕來害人，因此工人被其害者很多。他們雖然用盡種種方法，想捕捉它，但是二獅胆子很大，每天到了太陽西下，就大吼起來，一瞬間竟跑到天幕旁邊，想去吃人了。弄得工人們每夜不能安眠，輪流的在慕外守護，後來用機關鎗逐一打殺後，才得平安無事。</p>

<p>— 張友鑑</p>
<p>（一）飯司務把肥兒踢到大海裏去後，連忙放不救生船救起肥兒。</p>
<p>（二）走在路上，肥兒和榮兒都覺到肚子餓了，看見一家的窗口上放着一盆熱烘烘的麥粉餅，二人就拿來吃。</p>
<p>（三）被主人看見了，二人就拚命逃走。</p>
<p>（四）肥兒吃得太多，加之奔跑了一陣，肚子頓時痛了起來，路也跑不動了。後面又有人追樑，二人非常着急。</p>
<p>（五）榮兒忽然看見有一隻驢子在吃草，就帮樑肥兒先騎上去，自己再騎上去。</p>
<p>（六）不想驢子見了陌生人，大發脾氣，踢下肥兒，又來咬榮兒。</p>
<p>（七）二人都跌得筋骨酸痛，在地上爬不起來。</p>
<p>（八）恰巧有一輛救護車經過，連忙把二人抬上車子。這時，肥兒纔笑對榮兒說：「照這樣看起來，還虧得這隻驢子；不然，那有這樣快的回家？」</p>
<h3 id="c207">水手辛白德傳（一七） <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>我先休息了一會，便起身去散步，看看這地方，我見四下裏都是熟果，淸爭而鮮潔的溪流從斜坡上流下來，於是我就得了飲食。到得夜色來時，我躺下來，但因害怕而不能入睡，天明以後，我便很快樂了。</p>
<p>於是我出去散步，但我去還不遠，就瞧見溪岸上有一個老人，我先還以爲他是從破船上來的，他似乎既弱且病。我對他說話，但他並不回答我，他作勢向我，將他負在背上，一塊兒走過溪去。</p>
<p>我想他既需我相助，我便助他了，到得我們到了那溪的彼岸，我俯下來，好讓他很便利的離去。</p>
<p>然而這老人，我所以爲很弱的，却並不離去我的背。他騰起兩腿來繞住我的脖子，又這樣緊緊的扼住我的喉，我心想定要氣塞了。末後我跌下暈去，而那老人仍是老　着我：到得我再恢復了我的呼吸時，他踢我一下使我立將起來。</p>
<p>我接羞背他走近樹去，他時時吩咐我停住了尋果兒吃。他終日的不離我，到晚上我躺下來睡時，他仍然攀住在我的脖子上。這樣一天天下去，任是盡了我的力，總是不能去除這個老人。</p>
<p>諸位試估量一下，我天天背着這奇怪的老人，感覺是怎麼樣；我不論怎樣嘗試，總不能去除他。</p>
<p>一天我找到一個大葫蘆，便在內中用葡萄汁做了些酒。這酒很好，使我的心中輕快了，便唱着歌一路前去。</p>
<p>那老人瞧我喝着酒，又見那酒使我何等的良好，他便作勢要我給他一些。我給他喝後，却使他的頭腦輕快了，他開始唱起歌來，雖仍攀住我的脖子，却上下搖動着。</p>
<p>不多一會，他的腿却脫離了我的脖子，於是我猛力的擲在他地上，用一塊大石擊在他的頭上，將他處死了。</p>

<h3 id="c222">母親節感言 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 順</p>
<p>今天—五月十二日—是母親節！這是何等令人銘感的節日！母親的愛是高於一切的！愛倫凱女士說：『賽育子女的母親是像太陽一般神聖！』中國也有一句俗語，『母年一百歲，尙愛八十子』！這都是表現出母性愛的至高無上的！母愛不僅是個人的生命的源泉，並且是人類存續上最單純，最基本的要索！我們紀念勞動節及國恥日固然有社會的意義，同時紀念偉大的母氣節，更有其社會的人類的意義！</p>
<p>但是，我們應該怎樣去紀念它呢？上海中華據女節制會首先給我們提出如下的紀念辦法。</p>
<p>（一）無母親者上臺獻花。</p>
<p>（二）遠地者致函問候，如在遠地，作文頌楊母　，或捐欵慈善機關作母親最歡喜之慈善事業。</p>
<p>（三）不聽母教者立志改過。</p>
<p>（四）在本埠者用禮物，遊覽，宴會等使母親快樂。</p>
<p>可是，這種辦法，除了少數生活優裕的人們外，大多數窮苦的母親們和子女們當然是不能實行的，他們旣無買花捐欵的餘錢，又無作文頌揚母德的能力，更無所謂陪親遊玩的閑暇！婦女節制會諸君，似乎沒有顧及到大多數飢寒交迫的母親們和子女們！</p>
<p>我們知道，沒有一個母親不愛她們自己的兒女，同樣的沒有一個子女不願孝敬自已母親!可是，世界上會有逆子惡母是什麼綠故呢？這並不是他們的本生惡逆，是社會迫着他們不得不作惡作逆的！最近在各報上傳出，立煌縣某村兒子因飢寒交迫，烹食母親屍肉的消息!這固然是極端的實例，但就一般來講，在許多災荒區域，當父母者易子而食的事固有，出賣子女的事，更是司空見慣!即就今日本刋（日本婦運動向一則）中看來，我們更可以看到母親帝樑子女自殺的爲數之巨！而因金錢關係，親子問視同仇敵的，是極平常而普通的現象！據以上的情形，我們有什麼權利要他們互相孝愛呢！</p>
<p>退一萬步說，節制會的紀念辦法能够做得到，但這還是個人的事情，而沒有何等社會的章義！爲什麼？因爲各個人去紀念自己的母親，在被紀念的母親方面也許得到一時的安慰也禾可知，但她的當母親的痛苦，尤其在父權制度下的母性的被壓痛苦仍然不能解除，這樣的紀念還有什麼意義呢？因此，我們要紀念母親節，必須在社會的章義上去紀念牠!就是說，我們應當爲着解除全體母親的痛苦，更　樑使大多數的母親得到永久的安樂而紀念牠！</p>
<p>這樣看來，母親節是和我們婦女的解放，特別是母性保護問題很有關聯的！所以，我們在今日至少要向社會主張：一切的母親在家庭上，社會上，以至政治上，經濟上的利益與權利，這樣才不失爲眞正孝敬母親的紀念日!</p>
<h3 id="c223">日本婦運動向一則 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>—促進實施母子扶助法—</p>
<p>日本的首都東京，亦如世界各國的大都會一樣，一方面繁華熱鬧固不待言，他方面在這繁華熱鬧的地方，自己斬斷自己生命的自殺者，據每日新聞所報道的，記不勝記。但其中最惹我們注意的，却是絕了生活之路而自己斬斷自己生命的「母子自殺」事件之多。</p>
<p>這種事實，近年來最顯著的例子是，昭和八年度親子自殺的有三十五件，七年度則是三十四件。其中父親帶樑孩子的，僅只四件，其餘三十一件，都是母親連同孩子一道自殺的。</p>
<p>更據中央社會事業協會所調查的—這是只以東京日日，大阪每日，東京朝日，大阪朝日四大新聞所有的記事爲基礎的統計—一九二九到三三年的四年間，親子自殺的，計有一千零八件。人員則有二千七百八十九人，其中所包含的兒童數目，則超過一千六百十五人。又據此統計的「親」的性別來看，父親是三百六十四人，母親是七百七十四人，實際上母親的塲合是超過父親的一倍以上。</p>
<p>其中的原因，生活困難佔三百二十四，家庭不和一百十六，自己病苦九十，精神異常百零九，歇期的里五十四，孩子病苦二十一。這種種原因，可說都是由經濟問題出發的。</p>
<p>據說日木內務省於一九二五年由兒童保護的立塲，曾調查無父的貧因寡婦，而企圖過制定扶助法，但這種扶助法不但至今尙未實現，而一九二九年所定的救護法，也仍然是在一種數衍的狀態中。</p>
<p>原來這種救護法，是由一九三〇年四月起開始實施的。雖然當時內務省社會局聲稱，由此應被救護的人員總數是十五萬，總經費是八百萬元，但事實上被救護的人，在一九三三年度僅只有：</p>
<p>子　五一，九六四人</p>
<p>妊產婦　一三〇人</p>
<p>哺育乳兒中的母親　五五六人</p>
<p>共計　五二，六五〇人</p>
<p>且此救護額只有一人一日兩角錢的規定，雖然後來加到兩角五分，但每家每日不得超過一元。這種救護法，究竟能救着多少母子呢？由許多實例看來，不但人們靠此救護費終久難以生活下去，而月對於領欵的麻煩萬千的手續以及應領取的權利等也尙有不知道的，加之給方與受方又都帶有一種侮蔑之感，所以這種救護很難說能有充分的効果。</p>
<p>因此最近日本全國的婦人團體組織了一個母子扶助法實施促進聯盟，將這件事作爲今日婦人運動的主流而向議會請願了。</p>
<p>她們的主張：是妻子被人看爲製造家屬承繼人的工具的時代已經過去了。一切的兒童，是國家社會的，國家社會應有保護其生命的責任，而且義育這些兒童的母親們的生活，當然要有保證。</p>
<p>她們並主張：所謂母子扶助法者，是與救護法不同的，這乃是社會對於兒童及對於養育兒童的母親們所應盡的當然的責任。因此國家的法律上，應制定相當的母子保護法，把許許多多的母和子由營養不良與死的不安中解救出來。</p>

<p>— 梧</p>
<p>報載烟台眞光中學女生徐明娥，游南山賞梨化，被警士隨行調笑，終至慘遭槍殺。事後該地學聯會發出官言，有曰：</p>
<p>「眞光女中全體至南山遊賞梨花，……徐明娥等七人散遊至山澗東坡……不料是時尾隨彼等約有一小時左右之保安警士三人，突然行近彼等身旁，恣情嘻戲玩褻。其中一人，即兇犯孔繁樹者，更將隨身佩帶之盒槍拔持手中，錨準徐明娥等，口稱「照相」，在此遲疑之間，雖經其旁之二警士稍加阻止，而孔某聲言「我等現在怕誰」，言畢徐明娥即應聲而倒……查此次慘案之發生，固由於孔某之知識淺薄，氣燄狂熾，親人命如兒戲；而其所以致此者，概由統治彼等之地方行政長官玩忽職務所應負之咎也……」</p>
<p>學生總還是學生，有義氣，有熱情，有是非之心。從「五四」到如今，老了的是「大人」，學生總還有他們赤子的心情。本來，打死幾個人流點鮮血，染紅幾朶花，眞是頭髪尖的小事。而况死者是女性，又勞孔警士等血眼追逐了一小時，本就有其罪過；若還沒有這批學生，這事早就和雨點一樣無影無踪地飄過了的。徽章在胸，盒槍在手，「我等現在怕誰？」孔警士的豪語，足以使萬人佩服聖　東渡日本時，大可　他爲　員，必能不辱國的。</p>

<p>一幅血惺惺悽慘的殺人圖畫，尙遺留在我們的腦際時，日來報上又有如下的一段記載，躍上了我的眼簾：「英國來滬演技之伊索古馬戲班團員荷蘭人某（姓名捕房未予宣佈）於四月三十日，誘騙一行經馬戲班門前之十三歲女童，入內看戲，至第三日下午，由一華工苦力名王根本者，帮同將伊强姦，事後山王根本誘帶至大千世界游玩，始被女童之母舅章皓月之同事瞥見，乃得追獲，嗚捕拘入捕房，該女當即供稱伊各尹阿培，爲現任天蟾舞豪編劇兼藝員尹聲濤之養女，繼乃歷述經過甚詳，當時捕房帶同受害人指認强姦西人，搜索物證，頗爲嚴厲，並囑尹聲　於翌日上午，再至捕房，分別向嗬蘭領事館，及第二特區法院進行起訴乎續，孰知尹聲濤至三“准時前往，捕房忽變熊度，下午更宜佈不予受理，且將要證王根木即予開釋，尹馨濤受屆莫伸，分函伶界聯合會揚州旅滬同鄉會籲請援助」本來，强姦十三歲的少女，法律規定得科徒刑，奈何帝國主義者的領事裁判權，依舊在中國作威作福，中國法律等於中國英雄不能用武於租界!這裏受屈最利害的，當然是一般平民，尤其是弱女子。中國女子，和中國男子同樣，受帝國主義者政一洽的經濟的壓迫外，更添上上一層性的被蹂躪。嗚呼！帝國主義與中國女子！</p>
<p>滬上婦女團體林立，對這少女的慘被凌辱，應當比任何團體更勇敢地起來聲援。這才是正爲民族爭光榮的應應職務。</p>
<h3 id="c226">京市第一托兒所參觀記 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 先</p>
<p>夕陽西下，正是放學時候，我沿外交部，丁家橋走，經過中央黨部，玄武湖，往北不遠，便到了目的地，就是我今天特意失參觀的京市婦女文化促進會所主辦的第一托兒所。</p>
<p>該所在玄武湖旁邊，風景美好，空氣新鮮。西式中化的建築一所，屋外草地如茵，實有數丈。小秋千，沙盤等兒童遊戲設備都有。其時剛到散學時候，遊戲塲中尙留若干小天使，每人穿一個圍兜，有滾淡綠邊的，有滾紫邊的，都山所裏預備，非常整齊美觀。這些小天使們多半來自中等家庭，而且父母都是受過新知識的洗禮，或在京各機關服務的。因此，他們和她們都異常强壯，整潔，活潑可愛。</p>
<p>記者投名刺後，由該所教務主任黃傑女土出來接洽。黃女士研究兒童教育有素，從事幼稚教育近廿年，經騐之豐富可想而知。此次被聘，主持該所教務，並兼育兒指導，純系熱心公益事業，報酬是談不到的。黃女士有男女公子六七位，所以對於育兒方面也是經騐豐富的，當和記者談話時，她的小女公子正在旁邊玩沙土，活潑天眞，憨態可掬，確乎表現了教育的功能，非一般的小孩可比擬。</p>
<p>記者詢及該所情形，承黃先生介紹於該所主任龔慕蘭女士。和聾女士留學美國，研究幼稚教育。當經龔女士敘述該所緣起，經過及現狀，並給我各種章程表册。旋復參觀該所教室，寢室等內部，由李峙山女士指導。李女士爲京市婦運宿將婦女文化促進會主要份子，亦該所負責人之一。</p>
<p>茲將該所緣起，經過及現狀分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）緣起—京市第一托兒所由京市婦女促進會主辦。該會因鑑於現代婦運最先的前提，厥惟解决婦女工作的障得。結婚婦女每因負育兒之責任而不得不停止從事社會事業，於婦運上是一個最大的障礙。同時，有些婦女因經濟的困難必需到社會上找職業，便不能兼顧家庭。復次，中等以下家庭，經濟有限，如果不想照舊式的方法，馬馬虎處教育見女的話對於進步的方法的育兒之設備以及年齡不等的兒女的生活上，教育上的種種設備均無法使其完備。即使中等以上家庭經濟可能的話，每個家庭爲了少數的兒女各個地建設起來，也是太不經濟的，太不合理的浪費，况且每個女性育見的天性，不是每個女人都有教育見童善良的技能，因而要每個母親去教育自己的子女是不可能的。古人易子　教，就是中國固有的文化教育也是中張兒童公育的了。雖說現在有人想喊出婦女回到家庭裏的口號，可是現代的婦女都只願意往前進。她們知道：一方面要發展白我的個性；一方而要强國建　，兒童必需要有良善的訓練，但兩種事是相矛的，（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c227">第四節　初夜權 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>「初夜權」——這在「文明」世紀中生活着的現代人看來，彷彿是「天方夜譚」中的神話一樣神秘而有趣的事情。可是這並不是神話，而是距今一千餘年前在我們的社會裏，的的確碗存在過的事實。這不單絲毫沒有神秘，反而是公然的，合法的蹂躪女性的歷史的事實。</p>
<p>所謂初夜權，就是封建領主對農奴實行性的榨取的超人權的權利。詳細點講，在封建時代一切農民要結婚的時候，把新娘讓給地主同宿初夜，蹂躪其處女性。因此有人說，領主是「一切結婚的試食者」。</p>
<p>初夜權是封建時代的法律上的一種制度，而有其久遠的歷史的根據的。據培培爾的意見，在母權氏族崩壞後，婦女爲男子所獨占，但這是違反於氏族的法規的，因此在初期婦女要結婚時先在氏族中實行其性的開放，然後才去和一定的男子結婚。到了封建時代，此種習慣便歸爲領主的初夜權。此種制度在中國似乎不曾存在過，但在歐洲，許多歷史的法律文獻中發現牠的確實的證據。在蘇格蘭，葉維奴斯三世王發表一種法律，規定貴族有和自已的一切農民的新娘同宿初夜的權利。這法律到了一〇七五年爲瑪爾可姆王所修改，規定農民欲贖回新娘的處女性，必須納入若干的金額。在法國也有過同樣的法律，在德國及瑞士，初夜權一直保存到十六世紀。</p>
<p>隨着封建制度的崩壞，初枚權的形式也跟着發生變化。就是要結婚的農民，祇要拿出相當的物質的等價物　可以　回妻的處女性。換言之，　物質的榨取來替代了性的榨取。關於這，在培培爾的　婦人與社會一中有如下的一段話：</p>
<p>「在農奴及業人們要結婚的時候，一定要招待他們的主人及其妻。這樣主人是在車上滿載着乾薪來參加結婚式。同時新娘和新郎是將一隻四分之一的燒豬奉上主人。結婚式完了後，新郎是非把自己的妻的初夜權讓給主人不可。假使不願意的話，須拿出六先令四辨士來贖回妻的初夜權。」</p>
<p>封建領主是隨時隨意干涉農民的家庭生活，及結婚關係。富於色慾的領主是不單限於初夜權，卽使在平時也隨使强迫農民的婦女，以滿足其獸慾。列奧·西德羅維茨在「平民風俗史」一書中，再三證明封建領主任情蹂躪晨民的妻，女及新娘的歷史的事實，他說道：</p>
<p>「古代的奴隸爲着滿足其主人的肉慾，無諭何時都要準備犧牲自己的身體。同樣地，半數的女性是爲樑滿足其主人（卽領主）的色情，不得不（把自身）一任於他的自　山　分。」</p>
<p>所謂初夜權，在我們婦女的立塲看來，不僅是領主　農奴的性的搾取，而且是男權壓迫女權的最極端的表現　縱使領主不干涉農民的家庭生活，但婦女在農民家庭的地位幾等於零。農奴的妻是絕對隸屬於丈夫的奴隸。地們在家庭中不單沒有愛情的自由可言，並且　負祖了困難的生產的勞動，土地的耕種及收獲，家畜的飼養，織布洗衣等做不完的勞動都由她們去負担。假使一不留心，就要受翁姑的懲罰。封建社會裏的婦女實在過樑十八層地獄的生活。</p>
<p>在中國是否存在過初夜權制度？無史賾可考，不得而知。但一般男子對妻的初夜權，在現在還非常重靦。在廣東，現在還有「吃燒豬」的風俗。詳言之，結婚的第二天，新郎證明新娘的處女性（即變相的初夜權制）時，男家將若干隻燒豬肉送給女家，表示滿意。這風俗和上記培培爾引用文中的「一隻四分之一的燒豬』聯繫起來觀察的時候，在中國也有過這種制度是司以推斷的。</p>
<p>這　變相的初夜權制，在現代的「文明一社會裏却當作很平常的事體而存在着。現代的男人們對於新娘的處女膜是否破損的問題，還非常關心。並且把牠看作婦女的社會的道德的問題。去年在山東某女學校檢查女生的處女膜的消息，不管其是否屬實，都是和男子對婦女的初夜權的要求有密接的關聯。可是，關於新郎是否貞　的問題，男性中心社會是不去管它的。所以我們理解初夜權，不要單純的把她看做封建時代的特殊的現象，在現權制度未被　滅以前隨時隨地都實行變相的初夜權制度是無疑的！</p>

<h3 id="c230">怎樣學寫理論文章？ <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 素人</p>
<p>如果你要寫某種理論的文章，那首先你就必須去多讀那種理論的著作。因爲一定要你底腦子裏有了那種理論的體系，有了構成這體系的豐富的內容，你才能作出關於那種理論的完善的文章。其次，你除努力多讀之外，還須要多多寫作。我常看到許多苦學的靑年朋友，他們曾苦讀了若干的理論書籍，在別人談到他們所研究的理論時，他們也很知道，有時甚至還覺得別人談的不好，但如呌他們談論時，他們便不能系統地發表其意見了。這是什麼原因呢？那便是由於他們只是埋頭苦讀，沒有經常寫作，沒有經常整理其研究所得的緣故。還有，在研究和寫作時，常與別人討論，交換意見，刺激你底感覺：這對於你也是必要的。所以，善做文章的歐陽修說：「練習作文有三多：就是看多，做多，商量多。」</p>
<p>練習作文的「三多」旣經做到之後，你便應該特別注意寫作時的方法了：</p>
<p>第一，每一種理論的著作，都必然有一，個或一個以上的中心意識。所以你在寫理論文章時，首先便須定下你所要表現的中心意見，隨着才從各方面依次地去講明它。不然的話，那你寫起來便是隨筆亂寫，東一句，西一句地瞎談，結果是使你寫的文章，沒有系統，沒有中心，別人看了也是莫明其醬油的。譬如，你要寫一篇論文學作家底作風的文章，那你便應首先確定這樣的一個中心意見：作家底作風，是由他所要表現於其作品中的思想內容，是由他所處的時代精神，是由他底個人環境與社會環境决定的；隨着便當應用你所認知的正確的文學理論的原理來說明這個中心意見，列論古今中外的文學作家底作風來證明這個中心意見之正確。</p>
<p>第二，中心意見確立後，你便應該籌劃怎樣組織這個中心意見，怎樣構成你底理論體系。說具體一點，就是你須擬定從那幾方面去說明你底意見；在你底全篇文章中應該分爲好多大段。就拿上述的論作家底作風的文章來說吧。假使你已經决定要寫這篇文章，並要在這文章中發表上述那樣的中心意見時，那你便應凝定這文章應該分成這樣幾個大段：（一）何謂「作風」？（二）文學底內容與形式，（三）作家與社會，（四）……然後依次寫下去。在這中間，你更須多多蒐集實際材枓，以論究古今中外的許多多作家底作風來表明你底理論。具體說來，便是你在寫這篇文章時，必須站在你所認知的正確的立塲上去論究古典主義的作家何以往重規律，注重感情，而浪漫主義的作家何以又恰恰與之相反；杜斯托以夫斯基在寫作時何以那麼高興從故事的中間開始，那麼喜歡在其作品中佈置緊張的塲面，那麼深刻地描寫其主人公的心理：屠格湼夫又何以好從故事底終結開始來寫作，何以喜歡用回憶的法則來展開他所描寫的故事：曹雪芹底一紅樓夢」的描寫何以是那麼柔情，其章回小說的樣式是怎樣出現的出現的；…——依據這些實際的研究去充實你底文章底內容，證明你底理論之正確。要這樣，你這篇文章才算有實際約內容，才不是空虛的理論，因而才能得到多數讀者底共鳴。</p>
<p>第三，詳細說來，一篇理論文章不僅有其整個的中心意識，而且，其每一大段，每一小節乃至於每一句也都是有中心意識的。沒有整個中心意識的文章，便是全部理論混亂矛盾的文章；一個大段，一個小節如果沒有中心意識，也是部分的混亂；同樣，一個句子如果沒有中心意　，那句子便不通了，便不能成其爲句子。你知道，理論文章第一重要的便是說理明白，淸順，有條理，但一篇有條理，淸順明白的文章，乃是以表明了中心意的句子，小節，大段構成的。所以，你在寫理論文章時，不僅要　定整個體系，劃分大段，而且要依次地明白地去組織每一大段每一小節與每一句底中心意識。</p>
<p>第四，詞句是文章底基礎，所以造句對於作文非常重要。理論文章底詞句是以抽象的言詞去說明客觀事物的，因之每一詞句都須與客觀事物扣適合；否則就不通了。譬如，「獅子是猛獸」，這　是與客觀事物相適合的、通的：但苦在理論文章中寫一句「獅子是大大的美麗活潑的小姑娘」，那便是與客觀事物不相合的矛盾百出的不通的表現。同時，理論文章底構成，是結詞而成句，結句而成節，結節而成段，結段而成章，而成全文的，所以寫起文章來，不僅要句子通順明白，而且每段每節都要通順明白，有次序。</p>
<p>第五，如你已經有了上述的知能時，便應　修辭上注意。理論文章貴乎明白簡潔和有力量、造句修辭便應以此爲原則。但你須注意不要故意去做作，一定要自然才行。有些人因爲過分注意修辭，常常違反自然地故意去做作、結果是反而不好，甚至鬧笑話。我曾聽到說過、以前有位濫秀才進京考試，在京中給他家裏寫了如是滑稽的一封信：「……今寄回裹襪一雙，裹者裹脚也，襪者襪子也，不言裹脚襪子，而言裹襪者、省文也。箱內有氈帽一頂，晴則晒，雨則收，否則霉、霉則濫、濫則不成其爲氈帽也！舍妹已成人、切勿令其處出，恐隔壁汪二麻子又起不良之心；然而，牆高數丈，亦無妨也！」這雖是一種書信體的笑話文章，但亦可用此說明在寫理論文章的修辭中故意做作之害。</p>

<h3 id="c231">創傷的農民 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 平文</p>
<p>我的故鄉—嘉定離上海只三十公里之遙、那地方可以說是鄰近都市的鄉鎭，也是全中國一百萬個鄕村中的一個。</p>
<p>在我幼年的時候，這個地方在附近各村中要算是一個較富庶的地方，但現有呢，單以田價而論，從前每畝一二百元尙很少有人願意出賣的、到去年年終時、破產的或需欵還債的農民將自己的肥田以每畝五十元的賤價出賣，還會使人述連搖頭呢！</p>
<p>農民的生產技術，當然還滯留在上古式的經騐時代、他們除了相信自己的一雙手以外，還相信天。五六年中，接述若荒歉。遭了蝗蟲災，創痛猶未復，繼之就是大水爲患、農產物多被淹沒。政府方待救濟，接着日帝國主義者的鐵蹄，於二十一年三月三日闖入這個破碎的農村，人民流離失所，春耕因之荒廢。嗣後二年，不是天時久旱，禾麥焦枯，就是穀賤傷農、不足以償成本。這幾年來的農民家庭，簡直是和板橋道人所說的「五月賣新絲」九月糶新穀，醫得眼前瘡，挖却心頭肉」的境况相彷彿。</p>
<p>去年，邑中有十幾位先覺之士，發起組織棉花產鎖合作社、一方面提倡種植十萬籽棉及江陰百籽棉，一方面自組銷售所，不再假手於重利盤剝的商人。但成效也鮮見。至於農民經濟的調濟，大多仍有賴於士豪及典舖。有的以重利向十豪賒欠豆餅之類的肥料，至年終若無力歸還、土豪就勒逼以田契抵押，書</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>明二分以至三分的利息，且須按複利計算，不過幾年，農人的田畝便都改入土豪的户册了。又有的農民，每逢靑黃不接的時候，提包携袱，徘徊於當舖的高櫃之下。至於農民銀行，雖然早已設立了，年來業務也頗有進展之勢，然而对於眞正的貧農，則收效極徵，甚至對於貧農是毫無關係的。一二八後，唯一的××當及其分設四鄉的代步一齐收歇了，其原因，據他們表面聲稱爲受一二八影響，其實是因爲當户當了不贖，使典業者的資本變成了呆滯的貨品，金融周轉不靈，於是不得不收歇了。後來雖由本地有錢士紳繼續改號接辦，但由此亦可見農村經濟困頓之一班了。</p>
<p>這要我要說到本地著名副產的土布了。以往，每當農閒時候，農村家庭裏機抒之聲相聞，每年所產士布，不僅可供全家大小的穿着，且每年還有巨量的輸出。在土布業鼎盛的時候，每天晨五六時，各布莊都有派人在各市梢去承接的，那時織成一疋布，可以賺到二三百文錢，每天可織二疋、雖只四五百文的收入，然於農民家庭也不無小補。可是比年以來，土布業一落千丈，一方面因銷路日狹，又一方面因售價日低，織布的人見無利可圖，乃不得不效煮鶴烹琴的故事了。</p>
<p>封建思想還支配着整個的嘉定。單講婚烟的構成，仍完全是一貫的賣買方式。有因爲娶妻，四方羅掘，無法償還，因而破產的甚多。婚後的生活往往不能得到些微的幸福。女子一嫁了丈失，她心上就存着嫁鷄隨鷄嫁狗隨狗的觀念，男權支配了一切。最近有一個比較勇取的女子，她在丈夫死了之後，另嫁了一個男人，不幸第二個男人又死了，她在這舊禮敎籠罩下的鄉村中，竟更勇敢的自動嫁了第三個男人，這在古老的鄉村中可以說是創聞，那女人爲萬人所側目　視是當然的，然而這勇敢的女子，她的嫁人却並不是由於自身的覺醒，實在還是由於生活的壓迫。</p>
<p>一方面，農民的生计儘管不能維持，但另一方面、近年來如龍舟的競渡，社戲，賽會迎神等等勞民傷財的舉動，却接踵的表演出來了，這在表面上看來，似乎是太平世界的景象，那知這正是火山上的跳舞呢？許多農民整天地皺着眉，而公子哥兒們却仍不乏優閒的雅興。他們需要官能上的享樂，他們需要精神正的刺激。於是召集一般好事之徒，發起他們與農民同樂的玩意兒。</p>
<p>在這典致勃勃的盛會中，有幾家小商店也許因此能像嗎啡針一樣將冷落的市面略爲興奮一下，然而我們的農民呢？他們不能不招待遠道而來的貴戚，尤其是那般勢利的從城中來的貴東貴戚，平日儘管老死不相往來，但會因盛會之故蓬門降臨佳客的。寅吃卯糧的農民，自己儘吃糠吃粺，但對於貴客却不能不，竭誠招待，後門出去當了冬衣，前門提進大魚大肉，他們把苦笑着的臉對着來客，這是何等悽厲的人間呀！</p>
<p>這樣的鄉鎭，在中國，雖只是滄海之一粟，然而牠的疾病却正是整個民族的疾病，牠的敗亡也正是整個中國的敗亡呀！</p>

<h3 id="c232">談名 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 貝</p>
<p>世界上還沒有人的時候，不，述萬物也還沒有生的時候，宇宙本來只是一個「繩繩不可名」的東西，就是老子所謂「無名天地之始」。後來因爲靠人腦的聰明，把一切世物的形象都賦與了一個名稱，從此人對於一切世物（包括人）才得了一個分別的觀念。</p>
<p>推究「名」之由來，原初都不過因爲要便於識物起見，任意假定下來的，但一經假定，世界却就因此多事了。</p>
<p>人旣爲萬物賦與了名，而同時人類自己又有人我之分，於是「名」的發展更煥爲大觀了。首先有所謂「氏」爲人們所採用，但因爲還有混淆之弊，故更在氏之下各加一個「名」，販夫走卒不妨張三李四，阿毛阿狗名之，大腹商賈則以福壽興隆爲妙，至於文人雅士，則其名除力求風雅如仁義忠誠之外，更須另取一個「字」，「字」而外更取一個「號」，「號」而外更來一個「別號」，所謂「字」「號」「別號」，無非名的變相，古人中一人身兼數「名」者，比比皆然。、</p>
<p>五四運動時代，曾哄動過一次廢姓運動。錢玄同先生毅然主張先把「氏」來「克忒」。爲表示决心起見，錢先生且身先士卒把錢玄同的「錢」一刀付之幽冥，從此吾家玄同一變而爲「疑古玄同」，這掌故將來在姓名進化史上當然應該大書特書的。</p>
<p>然而世人對於自己的名也有南種着法，一種當以蜀漢時的諸葛孔明爲代表，他在「出師表」中說：「不願聞達於諸侯，」所謂「不願聞達於諸侯」者，就是不願把自己的「名」聞達於諸侯的意思，他大槪也懂得「人怕出名猪怕胖」的哲理，所以只想躬耕於南陽，不願去捲入鬥爭的漩過。第二種當以名利中人爲代表，他們願意把自己的名字載諸史冊，傳諸後世，卽在生時，也常願自己的名字，每天用大號鉛字排在新聞報上。於是孜孜矻矻，唯恐其「名之不出！因爲要出自己的「名」不惜運用種種聰明方法，旁通曲達，吹牛拍馬，說來頗覺可笑，然當其事者却又並不覺得慚恧。</p>
<p>目前最出名的人，除政治舞台中人不算外，以影星，舞星，戲子，運動健將，游泳家爲最着。像胡蝶的皇后，梁家的姊妹花，梅郞的博士，周賢言的鐵門，楊秀瓊的美人魚，請問那個不曉誰個不知的？</p>
<p>然而有名萬禍之源，天理昭然，竟無可避免，因皇后胡蝶的芳名採作商標之故，已使兩家公司　控於前，今美人魚楊秀瓊的姓名權又因受侵害而請宋允惠律師聲明只此一家並無分出於後，先後輝映，益使吾人對此藉藉的芳名大興不敢逼視之長嘆。</p>
<p>據人說，阮玲玉的目殺，是因爲婚姻纏訟，誠恐爲盛名之累，故出之自殺的，然則名乎名乎竟爲殺身之禍源，名之可有而不可有也！</p>
<p>記得某某有云：『菩提本非樹，明鏡亦非臺，本來無一物，何處染塵埃？』不知名利塲中奔逐者讀此數語將作何感想？</p>

<h3 id="c233">廣州的乞丐 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 安人</p>
<p>說句公平話，廣州市的一切，這幾年來總算是在不停的朝前進展。譬如高大的洋房，柏油馬路，龐大的百貨公司，堂皇的酒家，汽車，女人，還有……，總之，廣州市的一切都是不斷地在增加和變動，祇要你隔上幾天不出來，就會使你起一種面目全非之感的。不過，廣州市也和別的都市一樣，有一種不能改良的社會現象，甚至於這種現象在廣州祇有一天天地擴大起來，這就是所謂煞風景的乞丐階級了。</p>
<p>乞丐也能形成一個階級，不免有人要說我是在故意張大其辭，好引起人家的注意：可是按照廣州市的實際情形看來，他們的確也是搆成這社會的一份子。據調查所得，他們的確實人數竟達四萬多人：若以廣州市的人口總數作比例，大約十個人當中就有一個是乞丐。</p>
<p>這班乞丐的來源，有的是生在富貴的家庭裏面，平日驕奢淫佚，無所不爲慣了，等到後來財產用罄，自己又沒有求生的技能，於是便不得不以十字街頭做他生存的尾間了。有的本是出身於乞丐家庭（？）自然沒有機會讓他去受敎育而學得求生的技能，因此，得一個衣鉢眞傳，做起乞丐來當然是格外便當。除了上述兩種來源以外，還有失業的狂潮也捲來了不少的乞丐。</p>
<p>拿廣州全市人口來說，十個人當中就得經常的供給一個人的生活，這的確是很不容易。不過這班乞丐倒不像上海的乞丐那樣一天到晚在馬路上向人家要錢，使人一見就頭痛而起一種憎恨的威覺，他們是决不會無緣無故的要別人白盡義務的。所以在廣州雖然有了這許多乞丐，倒並不像在上海那樣無論走到那裏都聽得見乞丐討錢的呼聲。他們謀生的方法很多，歸納起來大槪可分勞心與勞力兩種。勞力的工作白天是在街上拾烟頭，夜晚就背上一隻破篾簍子穿衖堂，看到有垃圾桶就亂翻一陣，破布屑，宇紙，碎玻璃，鐵罐頭，這些都是他們所要的對象。那些年富力强的就替儀仗店裏抬像亭旗杆，做一類粗笨的工作。勞心的工作，表面上看來似乎是非常淸閒自在，可是不工於心計的人却不容易應付的。他們整天的在各馬路上和大街小巷裏奔跑，想出種種方法去打聽別人家裏有什麼紅白喜事，如結婚，嫁女，死人，添丁都得調查個淸楚，回來報吿同道的份子，然後再另外派人到做事的人家那裏佈置一番。如果是婚嫁的，就在門口的牆上貼上一張長約三寸闊寸半的紅紙條，紙條上刻着「花子衆記」四字；假如是死人的話，就用藍色的紙條貼在門外使人不注意的牆脚下面。：如果如添丁，就祇當面向這家住戶討一封利市或薑醋，門口牆上也照樣貼上一張紅紙條。這種手續彷彿像政府要人民登記般的，他們同道的份子一見了這種條子，就知道這家住戶家裏有什麼事了。住戶對於這班乞丐，是看各人的境况如何做招待的標準的：有的供給他們一天的酒飯，或是一頓的也有：不過最低限度要給一桌殘菜。他們到這裏來吃飯時，也和別的賓客一般的彬彬有禮；而且大家先還得要環列在門口說上許多吉利的話，末了才由這一羣中的領袖進去把菜搬到外面，就席地圍坐着開始大嚼起來。</p>
<p>他們謀生的方法，都是各盡所能的向外發展，但是行動却須受團體的限制；如有什麼越軌的行爲，或是破壞團體的舉動，給他們中的領袖查到了，處罰的嚴厲却不是一般現行法律所可比擬的。管理他們的最高機關就是「化子會」，全市的乞丐都是這裏的會員；這會的組織也如普通的社會團體一樣的有會長，幹事各項職務。做會長的要在乞丐中具有很深的資望，而且還要有相當的權力；如果會員中有什慶人出了事時，會長就得設法援助。在這會的下面還有許多小組，每個小組也有一個資格很老的乞丐做組長，這一組會員的一切行動都得聽組長的指揮。他們出去做的工作，事先都是由組長分派妥當了才去實行；如在外面得到了油水，也得絲毫不能隱瞞地帶回來交給組長支配的。</p>
<p>做拾烟頭的工作，是很輕而易舉的。每天從早到晚，躑躅在街頭或是百貨公司和酒家門口，再或電影院和車站，因爲這種地方來往的人很多，烟頭的出產也就跟着豐富起來。不過一般富有拾烟頭的經騐的乞丐，他們對於街上的烟頭却不很重視、因爲街上往來的人多，吃剩下來的烟頭不一定都是上好的烟絲，賣的價錢也很有限。他們最好的目的地是跳舞塲和高貴的影戲院，或是上等的娼寮門口：到這裏來的吃烟的人，不用說醜姻是不吃的，所吃的大多數是外國上等烟，而且剩下來的烟頭又長，這種烟頭拾到一段，牠的價値簡直可以抵得那種起碼烟頭好幾倍。</p>
<p>這裏靠抬烟頭過活的，據社會局的調查約有二千二百多人，恐怕實際還不止其數：在「化子會」的會員總數當中，大約佔十分之二以上。他們的行踪，廣</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>泛的說，僅分河南和河北兩大區；河北因商業淸淡，僅有十分之一的人在那裏工作，河南因爲商業區域較大，所以又劃分爲河南尾，福塲園，大基頭，龍尾導四區。每區都有一個區領袖，監督在這區內拾烟頭的乞丐。各區的領袖，平常除了監視他部下的行動外，大都還兼營「二路烟」的副業。各區拾烟頭的乞丐所拾得的「油水」都得分給本區的領袖；領袖把這些拾得的烟頭收下來估量一下、除掉自己應得的之外、其餘的又由他出錢收買下來做「二路烟」的原料。所謂「二路烟」，就是把拾得的烟頭，不管好壞都攙在一起，重行用手工來捲成紙烟，十支二十支一包地賣給一般碼頭上的苦力和拉車夫去過癮，價錢當然比普通的香烟還要便宜幾倍。這些區領袖雖然也是乞丐一份子，可是他們的生活狀况倒不會比靠出賣勞力過生活的車夫壞：他們每天的收入，多時有一元半元，少時也有三四毫錢。但拾烟頭的乞丐的收入可少得多了，每天最多不過弄到兩毫子，甚至「斷米路」，也不算希奇，好在他們都很重義氣，假如有人斷了米路，另外的人得了手，還是要分給他的。所以他們一天兩頓的生活，倒不成問題；他們所認爲不易解决的，却是住的問題。因爲廣州不像上海有那麼多的衖堂可供他們做臨時宿舍，而且乞丐的人數又是那麼衆多，所以常常弄到無地可容的地步。現在廣州市的當局雖已設有勞工所，平民所，來收容這班乞丐，但究竟因爲人數過多，還是不能够盡量容納他們。</p>
<p>總之，這種過着特殊生活的乞丐羣愈是擴大範圍，便愈顯得社會的不安，同時也是一個民族的衰頹的徵兆啊！</p>

<h3 id="c235">詩的解說 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 其天</p>
<p>詩是文學的一個分野，其一般的性質和機能當然也和文學的一樣。不過，一說到詩，卽可使人想到「韻律」，「格式」等問題。所謂「有韻爲詩，無韻爲文」，這便是從來的一般東方學者對於詩的解釋。同時，就是在西方的詩人，文學家中，對於詩的了解，也有許多是完全依據於形式，韻律的。例如，詩人亞倫坡卽說詩是「美的韻律的創造」；考若薄敎授也說詩是「依了用韻格的語言正確地表現的思想及戚情而生出快樂的方術」；李亨德對於詩的韻律更特別重視，他也是常常以韻律來解釋詩的。</p>
<p>不錯，詩是有韻律，聲調乃至格式的，無論古今中外的詩都不是絕對地與這些毫無關係。不過，此種韻律，聲調，格式却不是一定的，不是古今中外沒有差異變動的。五言詩，七言詩與現在的新詩，雖各有其內在的韻律，聲調和格式，但它們却是各不相同；在現代的新詩中且有各種各樣的不同的格式存在。所謂韻律，聲調和格式，在這樣相對的意義下才可以作爲詩的要素。但這却不是說只有詩才具有這樣的要素，其他的任何東西都沒有；事實上，吿示符咒就有一定的韻律、聲調和格式，就有那些要素，但牠們却不能稱爲詩。所以我們應該說，詩是有一定的韻律，聲調和格式的，但有韻律，聲調和格式的却不一定是詩。同時，如果把韻律，聲調和格式等絕對化，說詩非有怎樣的韻律，聲調和格式不可，例如說詩一定要以幾個字爲一句，若干行爲一首，一定要有脚韻乃至每行一定要有幾個重音或輕音，那我們便可以說，有這樣的韻律，聲調和格式者，自然可以稱爲詩，但無此者却不一定就不是詩。</p>
<p>由此可見所謂韻律，聲調和格式，並不是詩的唯一的根本的存在意義，只是以之來解釋詩，來爲詩下定義，是不妥當的。</p>
<p>詩，尤其是近代的詩，就表面看來，似乎與人類生活沒有什麼關係。所以，人們對於詩的解說，最易發生玄妙的議論。古今中外的形式主義者對於詩的解釋，當然跳不出韻律，聲調和格式的圈子：與形式主義緊密地結合着的神學家在對於詩的說明上，則又離不開「靈感」乃至上帝的迷宮。古代的有名哲人柏拉圖說：『詩人不是靠藝術做詩，是靠靈感，且在一種神祉附身的境界裏。故善詩者，當其爲詩之時，必失其威官之作用，恰似柯立班蒂司之舞蹈一般。因爲詩是光明，是有翅的，是神聖的生靈；只有在有靈感時，戚官失去效用時，理智失其統馭時，才能作詩。』這當然是再神秘沒有的說法。不過，此　　種說法產生在古代社會，實是無足爲奇。最不幸的是還有一些生活在二十世紀的大敎授，竟認古代柏拉圖的這種說法爲正確，而公然地說「詩之爲物確有其未可理解之處」，這實在是最無知的表現！</p>
<p>實際上，詩雖然離人類的社會生活較遠，但牠却不能離開人類的社會生活而存在。無論任何形式的詩，乃至無論任何玄妙的對於詩的見解，都是社會的產物。柏拉圖的神秘意見，是產生於古代的奴隸社會中的；上述那些對於詩的形式主義的解說，也是那不講內容只求形式的人羣的生活意識的反映。</p>
<p>我們知道，歌詠愛情可以說是詩的主要表現之一。但所謂愛情也並非眞的是爲神秘的愛神所主宰的，它也是一種社會現象，因而就是「純粹」的抒情詩，也是人類的社會生活的反映。伊可戚奇說：「主張詩與全部社會生活沒有關係的人們，卽在戀愛詩上，也是犯着重大的謬誤。我們固然也承認由愛神而造成的詩歌的根底，常是同一的。一般人輒稱讚其愛人的美。但是，其表現的方法則以社會的變革而有深的變化。若其不信，則我們只須將中世紀或路易十四時代的戀愛與十九世紀者相比較，便够明白了。如巡遊詩人，如以神秘的熱情崇拜愛人的騎士，如優雅急於功名而文辭極其修飾的「偉大世紀的朝臣，最後如前世紀的多情男子繆塞，鮑特來爾或哈納，在其情熱的表現間，是有何等深刻的不同呀！」　　各時代各社會的戀愛之不同，在中國也可找到無數的例證。我們看，「詩經」上的戀愛詩，「西廂記」所表現的戀愛觀，「紅樓夢」與「金瓶梅」所描寫的戀愛情境，不是都有很大的差異嗎？這差異的原因，不消說都是存在於產生牠們的社會裏的。</p>
<p>由此可見就是戀愛詩也是由社會產生的藝術品。</p>
<p>如果我們更進而考究一下詩之起源時，則問題便更加明白了。這裏我們可以引出如下的一段文字——</p>
<p>「詩歌開始於人類語言開始之處。那陪伴着原始人的努力的自然呼聲是字句的胚胎，那最初的達意；這些呼聲是從動作中產生出來的，牠們正是些動作之自然的又能懂得的達意。這些勞動呼聲又成爲勞動歌的根原。歌不單是一件娛樂或散心的事。當衆人在勞動着時，歌詞可以聯合勞動者的努力，給他們一種和諧，一種節奏的規則和符合。」</p>
<p>此種情形，就在現在各地流行的許多歌謠中也可找到實際的說明，不用多作引證。</p>
<p>總而言之，無論從本質上，構成上或起源上說，詩都是與人類的社會生活分不開的。詩可以說是最高形式的文學，如果文學是借着文字的工具藝術地反映社會生活的，那麼，作爲最高形式的文學的詩便是以其所特有的詩的形式——韻律，聲調和格式表現社會生活的。詩與小說，戲劇的本質和機能並無根本上的不同，它們都是文學；如果要說它們有差異的話，那麼，這美異也只是在外的形式上存在，在其本質上是不存在的。</p>

<h3 id="c236">純情詩人雪萊（五） <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 日本鶴見祐輔作周樂山戚俊夫譯</p>
<p>雪萊察覺之後，戚到切膚的痛苦。他知道他的妻是因爲他和旁的女性交遊，由誤解而起的强烈的嫉妬的時候，他由衷的對他的妻感到輕蔑之情。</p>
<p>二人之間起了種種不快事件之後，雪萊覺到再也不能使妻改心，於是便陷入痛苦，絕望的深淵之中。</p>
<p>對於頑强的妻的態度失望，獨自走出街巷的雪萊，口裏誦着「冰樣的心，大的冰塊」，沒目的的彷徨於倫敦的街頭。哀痛塞胸，悲傷得眼淚都流不出來。</p>
<p>在他的世界裏，這時像朝日似的忽然現出來的，是哥特文的親生女兒梅麗（Mary　Godwin）。這時的哥特文尙旅行於蘇格蘭中。</p>
<p>她是位細長的瘦形，鳶色的眼，金髮蓬鬆的姑娘。然而她那贏弱的姿態之中，却潛藏着凜凜然堅强的靈魂。這種具有女性的優雅，同時又具有雌獅似的勇氣的，是雪萊所求的理想的女性。而且她有父親遺傳的頭腦，具備縱橫談論哲學和詩論的敎養。對於敎養低的妻失望的雪萊，受這顆明的星誘導，像向着春天的陽光展開的自然。</p>
<p>但，和常人完全不同的雪萊，對於梅麗並不持友誼以上的感情。他從靑年的時睽就有一種不可思議的奇癖，便是要努力以自己內心的光，明和自己所接觸的人們的心。所以他不管對方是男是女，他只知講說人生的眞和美啟發那人。他不曾注意到他那生氣勃勃燦爛秀麗的美貌在年靑的異性胸裏是喚起如何的感激，他仍是天眞爛漫的。從這一點說來，他又是非常識的。</p>
<p>現在他發現了年靑美貌的梅麗是他的會心之友，但他那裏曉得，梅麗在和他初會之後就一見傾心的戀着他呢！</p>
<p>兩人親密的相携着，逍遙郊外。</p>
<p>她伴着雪萊到自己親生母—哥特文的前妻—的墓畔，坐在墓石的旁邊。雪萊談論人生，講說詩。而且給了她他的長篇詩Oueen　Mab那時他自費印刷了二百五十部。那是他十八歲時作的。</p>
<p>那一天晚上歸家的梅麗、在詩扉上寫着：</p>
<p>『恐怕這詩扉不至被旁人看見吧，所以我敢大膽的寫我所欲寫的。我之愛這詩的作者是非筆墨所能描繪的。「我縱然沒有屬於你的那一天，也絕不會屬於任何他人。」我心裏這樣的誓言着。』</p>
<p>對於妻失望的雪萊的心，像着了水似的一天一天的向着梅麗這方面流去。最後，他以少年的單純說出他另有所愛，對海麗要求別離。他從他的主義出發，以爲不愛的兩人的別離是很正當的，但社會的規律却不准許，而且不曾完全失去愛情的海麗是很難承諾的。但，相信妻的不貞的雪萊，要繼續世俗體裁的夫婦形式，無論如何是認爲不正當的。</p>
<p>他終於帶着梅麗渡海私奔到法蘭西去。伴着他們的還有梅麗的繼姐Jane。</p>
<p>從那日起，社會對他起了劇烈的迫害。這迫害直到死還纏擾着他。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>到了巴黎的時候，三人囊空如洗。</p>
<p>他把錶和鎖當了一百六十法郞。又拿着介紹信到巴黎的銀行家去借來六百元，三人開始向瑞士出發。</p>
<p>要乘驛傳馬車，旅費又不足，他便决定步行。於是想起一個妙法，便是買一頭驢駄着行李，三人輪流着騎。翌朝，他到家畜市塲買了一頭非常小的驢子。這頭小驢子載着三人，遙遙的奔向Alps山。</p>
<p>兩位小姑娘被這位具有姑娘似的優嫻之風的靑年守護着，在拿破崙戰敗，百萬大軍散亂的法蘭西的村路上，騎着小小的驢子，顚簸的向前進行。走了許多哩後，驢子走不動了，於是雪萊　Jane輪流着拖着驢子走。</p>
<p>那一晚，在泊宿的村子裏，把這頭小驢賣了，又另買了一頭驢子。</p>
<p>爲侵入的敵軍所刧掠後的法蘭西村莊，食物貧乏。所謂客棧，僅是一個名子而已。他們三人在沒有火氣的客棧裏顫抖着。成羣的大鼠不時的來騷擾他們。就這樣的，繼續着趕路。</p>
<p>他們不爲匪刧，不曾傷風，很快的找到了瑞士中央的Luceine湖畔的一小邑Brunuen。在一家別墅裏租了兩間房子，買了桌椅，想「永久的住在這裏」。但古老的火爐怎樣也燃不着人。Alps寒冷的冬季的風不住的吹來，他說：「回去吧，」第二天就趕緊的離開這兒，遄返倫敦。</p>
<p>踏進倫敦的街頭的時候，照例的囊空如洗。因爲沒有錢付馬車錢，便跑到銀行裏去，誰知先前的存欵全部被妻海麗支去了。又跑到海麗家裏，才要出幾鎊金幣，移到一家汚穢的旅館裏。</p>
<p>梅麗的父親哥特文禁北他的兩個姑娘和雪萊來往。哥特文的政治的正義裏說：「如其和不愛者結婚，莫如和愛者共同生活」。這種思想深入年靑的雪萊的腦中。因此雪萊把　這意旨用信寫給哥特文，但回信說：「那種思想在烏托邦可以實行的，在現代社會裏是不可能。」</p>
<p>在困難之中的雪萊又聽說他的債權者要請求法庭下逮捕令，他說不定何時被投獄。這筆負債是因爲哥特文的文化事業的失收，他設法借了一萬餘元給他付債。不但如此，哥特文也向他要起錢來了，用信來催促他。</p>
<p>爲着這許多事而驚惶的雪萊寫信給哥特文說他無道理。一面催錢，一面却又不許他和他見面。老哲人想、要是准許一位以不正當的方法奪去自己的姑娘的男子到自己家裏來、而且又是向那男子借錢、恐怕會被世間批難說是以女兒換金吧，所以只回答說要錢，若是會面、那是辦不到的。</p>
<p>雪萊爲了這老哲人犧牲了許多金錢，但他不憎恨這人。他是一個對於加害自己的人不懷憎惡之感的人。（未完）</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e51">Nie Yufu's Theory of Using Manual Labor to Manage the Yellow River <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The Yellow River has been a major disaster in the north since ancient times. River works have also been a source of corruption for generations. Precisely because it is a major disaster, those who manage it are dedicated and diligent. The methods of river management have been used until now. Although based on differences in era, the flourishing of science, and the results of technological advancements, they are ultimately just adjustments within that framework. Also precisely because it is a source of corruption, river works have been a desirable position throughout history. People use the name of annual repairs to carry out their embezzlement and self-enrichment. As a result, those who handle the project do not seek its durability, and those who rush to repair breaches do not seek its speed. Collapsing and repairing from time to time is the way to make money, and river works cannot be questioned, and there is no hope for a day of peace for the Yellow River disaster.</p>
<p>Using water should be based on benefiting the people, conforming to the land, taking advantage of the time, and then great benefits arise. But there must also be methods and the right people. Otherwise, the work will not be solid, the treasury will be emptied, and not only will benefits not be seen, but the harms will be even greater. Didn't we see that the breach of Guantai was difficult to complete for a long time, but later it was closed in less than a month? When the authority is unified, the funding is concentrated, the construction is easy, and the inspection is convenient, its effectiveness is naturally rapid.</p>
<p>This time, the League of Nations dispatched water conservancy expert Mr. Nie Yufu to China. As a result of his inspection of the Yellow River, he said that some previous water conservancy experts who inspected the Yellow River water conservancy always said that it would take tens of millions of yuan to purchase machines, and thought it contained a "machine-selling" effect, and was not considering China itself. He said, "To develop the Yellow River water conservancy and prevent floods, it is not necessary to rely entirely on machines. Hoes and plows can also do the job. Chinese farmers are exceptionally diligent and thrifty. Using manual labor to excavate can already prevent floods and irrigate the fields on both sides." He also said, "Hundreds of millions of huge sums of money, in times of extreme social and economic panic, may be impossible to raise in a short period of time. However, the Yellow River water conservancy cannot be delayed due to difficulties in raising money." We have already hated the results of so-called "foreign experts" coming to China for inspections, none of which have the true insight of Mr. Nie. We also admire Mr. Nie's spirit of loyalty in planning and trustworthiness in handling affairs, which is truly rare. However, we do not sing praises for his not needing machines and using hoes and plows to manage the river, but for his not covering up shortcomings and not being stubborn, but planning based on what China currently needs and what can be done. Are there any foreigners who come to China who can abandon their self-interest and not secretly serve their homeland's industry and commerce with loyalty and seek their benefits? If they want to promote the sale of their river management machines, then they say that it is necessary to raise tens of millions of yuan to purchase machines. If they change to another thing, then they say that it is necessary to raise tens of millions of yuan to purchase their materials. If this is the case, then every time our country starts a career, it will be an extra income for foreign countries, and foreign goods will also have an extra sales channel. If the purchased machines cannot be used, or if they are used but cannot fulfill their purpose, then they are simply rotten copper and scrap iron. However, those who plan have already sold their skills and taken our tens of millions of dollars to travel overseas, while we can only cry helplessly and be unable to do anything. Therefore, Mr. Nie can reveal this point, which is incomparable to those who make big talk with a briefcase. It is also impossible to come up with this without a spirit of great impartiality and selflessness. How can we not admire him?</p>
<p>Not using machines to manage the river, but using manual labor. This statement is not a call to turn back the clock. Europeans and Americans have indeed benefited greatly from machines, but the suffering they have received from machines is also becoming more and more profound. Because the ability of one machine is always more than enough for dozens or hundreds of people. The more developed the use of machinery, the more people are deprived of labor. As a result, the problem of unemployment that cannot be dealt with has become the biggest difficulty in Europe and the United States today. Our country does not know how to use machines well, and has suffered oppression from those who use machines, and the pain is also unbearable. This is a fact. Those who want to get rid of poverty and weakness want to widely deploy machines to save poverty and weakness. The statement is also approximate. However, we should also prevent the suffering that Europeans and Americans are experiencing today. China is not good at using machines, and labor is already excessively abundant. If machines become developed, although it is said that machines are only used to make labor valuable, if it is possible to achieve results without using machines, it is still better to use more manual labor. Because even if the income is less, at least there is work to be done and food to eat. This is also the key to maintaining people's livelihood at present. Therefore, since river works can be effective with manual labor, there is no need to use machines again. Even in ancient times, river dredging and canal excavation mostly used agricultural gaps. Because those who manage water manage fields. Water benefits and fields are also involved. The relationship between farmland and water conservancy, and between farmers and river dredging is inherently close. Therefore, it can be seen that Mr. Nie's words are in line with China's current situation. They cannot be regarded as ordinary guest officials. Now that Mr. Nie is gone, I deeply hope that he can have detailed and practical regulations to help us manage the river. In the future, we will celebrate the peace of the river together. How can Mr. Nie's contribution be ignored?</p>
<h3 id="e52">Japanese Lure Key Figures from Various Factions to Form a Cabinet Deliberation Council; 15 Members Officially Appointed; Seiyukai Opposes, Minseito Agrees <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai decided to expel Mizuno Rentaro and Mochizuki Keisuke, elders of the party, for disregarding party opinions and participating in the Cabinet Deliberation Council. Yesterday, Secretary-General Matsuno of the Seiyukai issued a statement saying that they would follow the decision of the General Affairs Committee and take expulsion procedures against Mizuno and Mochizuki. After reporting to President Suzuki, they immediately notified the two. The Seiyukai's criticism of the Cabinet Deliberation Council remains unchanged, considering it a useless appendage. "We do not want the results to be bad, but we will observe its actions and criticize with a solemn attitude," he said.</p>
<p>The Minseito issued a statement in the form of a conversation by Secretary-General Kawasaki on the 10th regarding the establishment of the Deliberation Council. "The establishment of the Deliberation Council is particularly commendable. The government's ability to concentrate such talent cannot be said to be unsuccessful. Each member can be truly called a first-class figure representing all aspects of Japan. Although the Seiyukai's refusal to participate is extremely regrettable, it can be regarded as an internal matter of the party that prevents it from participating. No matter who is in charge, the Deliberation Council is a necessary organ, and the parallel establishment of a specialized organization such as the Research Bureau is expected to have considerable effectiveness. The lineup is complete, and business will begin within days. However, it is necessary to exert efforts to achieve results in opening up the extraordinary situation with a spirit of national unity," (Dentsu dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the government has completed the selection of 15 members of the Cabinet Deliberation Council, it was officially decided by the Cabinet Council and immediately reported for approval. Today at 11:00 am, the appointment of the Director-General of the Research Bureau and the replacement of the Cabinet Secretary-General were announced at the same time, as follows: Prime Minister Okada Keisuke was appointed Chairman of the Cabinet Deliberation Council, and Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Cabinet Deliberation Council. Baron Yamamoto Tatsuo, Baron Kuroda Nagakazu, Viscount Aoki Nobumitsu, Raimu Ki Keikichi, Kawasaki Takujo, Tomita Kojiro, Mizuno Rentaro, Mochizuki Keisuke, Adachi Kenzo, Akita Kiyoshi, Izawa Takio, Baba Eiichi, Kagami Kenkichi, and Ikeda Seihin were appointed members of the Cabinet Deliberation Council. Yoshida Shigeru was appointed Director-General of the Cabinet Research Bureau, and Shirane Takesuke was appointed Cabinet Secretary-General. (Dentsu dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the work of the government's Cabinet Deliberation Council, because Izawa Takio answered and agreed at 4:00 pm yesterday, all 15 members were decided. The appointment of the members of the Deliberation Council, the Director-General of the Research Bureau, and the Cabinet Secretary-General were announced together at 11:00 am this morning. The selection of members this time was approved by both Saito and Yamamoto, and the elders Mochizuki and Mizuno were selected from the Seiyukai, which is in direct conflict. This cannot be said to be a success for the government. Furthermore, it is paired with Aoki, Kuroda, Baba, and others from the noble house, and Izawa, a bureaucrat, as well as Adachi, President of the Kokudo, Akita, who is quasi-Seiyukai, and the three members of the Minseito. It can be said that the purpose of strengthening the Cabinet has been achieved. As a result, the government has completely dispelled the talk of political change, and has begun to compile the budget for Showa 11 (1936). At the same time, it has established a policy of coping with the ordinary Diet session with this lineup. Furthermore, the plan for the organization of a new party centered on Tokonami Takejiro and Akita Kiyoshi will become apparent, so the relationship between the government and the Seiyukai will become increasingly subtle. (Dentsu dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government has established a Cabinet Deliberation Council and lured Mizuno and Mochizuki from the Seiyukai to be members. There is no doubt that this has stimulated the anti-government feelings of Suzuki, Kuhara, and others. However, with the Diet not yet in session, although the Seiyukai has taken an anti-government stance, it cannot shake the political situation. However, the relationship between the government and the Seiyukai has further deteriorated. As a result of this evolution, the two will inevitably clash in the next Diet session.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the Seiyukai's General Affairs Committee meeting at 2:00 pm on the 10th, it was decided to expel Mochizuki and Mizuno from the party. After obtaining the approval of President Suzuki, they were immediately notified. Other party members of the Seiyukai who participate in the Cabinet Research Bureau in the future will also be expelled from the party in order to maintain order within the party.</p>
<p>The expulsion of key figures Mochizuki and Mizuno from the Seiyukai was met with dissatisfaction by the Tokonami faction of the old Seiyukai. They held a meeting at Taotaotei on the evening of the 10th, planning to take this opportunity to establish a new party. The time will be around the time of the House of Representatives general election in November. According to participants in this movement, there are currently 50 people who can withdraw from the Seiyukai unconditionally, and it may reach more than 100 people this autumn.

<p>(Washington) The unprecedented large-scale US naval exercise has reached the point of beginning operations. Far in the Pacific, the mysterious black enemy fleet and the blue fleet defending the US territories in the Pacific are today deploying their positions. The black fleet, probably composed of cruisers, will conclude its reconnaissance of the Aleutian Islands area in three days. The blue fleet, concentrated between Honolulu and Midway Island, has occupied a position to intercept enemy attacks on the Hawaiian Islands. The 45 naval aircraft that departed in formation yesterday are now missing. However, reliable sources here have learned that the large group of aircraft flew to Midway Island to defend its air base, awaiting the arrival of the blue fleet within three days. Although the exercise plan has not been announced, according to information obtained here, the exercise particularly emphasizes the US air defense in the northwest and the possibility of opening an air base in Alaska.

<h3 id="e55">European and American Military Alliance to Jointly Defeat Japan; Correspondence from Kojima Seiichi <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>On May 3, the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun published a long communication by Kojima Seiichi, titled "Japan as Seen from Europe." Here is an excerpt: (1) Europe has a deep sense of aversion to Japan. An economist who recently returned from Geneva gave a very interesting talk on the current situation in Europe. First, today's Europe has a sense of aversion and fear of Japan, which is even greater than the bomb dropped when Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. Why? Recently, there has been a sudden increase in books in Western languages that study Japan's economic situation, etc. Although some of them praise Japan, most of them are Japan's own propaganda. People therefore think that they can ease their feelings towards Japan, but this is a big mistake. The rise of Japanese industry and the dumping of Japanese goods overseas have increased the hatred of all European countries towards Japan. As a result, people are becoming more and more concerned about the reality of Japan's situation. Recently, League of Nations Secretary-General Henderson openly criticized Japan and scolded Japan as "the most ferocious enemy of world peace." This situation is almost a common observation among European intellectuals, similar to the suspicion of Germany. Second, judging from the extraordinary and tense lives of European nationals, their lives compared with those of Japanese nationals are all worrying. Because European nationals, whether in politics or economy, have fallen into extreme poverty, and it is questionable whether Japan's international and domestic status is stable. However, the Japanese themselves are always very optimistic and despise the antipathy of Europeans. From the perspective of the development of the national situation, it is inevitable that a big mistake will be made in the future. Third, Europe itself is now at a critical moment in resolving its own problems, and the instability of the international political situation is becoming more and more serious. This difficulty is by no means easy, so it is inevitable that a second world war will occur. If a war unfortunately occurs, then all European countries will collapse one after another, and Japan can establish the right to dominate the Far East. Therefore, at present, European countries should not argue with each other for the sake of protecting the common interests of the Orient. Especially when looking at the words and actions of Europeans in Europe, their concern for Japan is almost the same as when Germany announced the destruction of the Treaty of Versailles. However, once returning to Japan, thinking that European countries are very indifferent to the Far East issue is a mistake. (2) Japan's policy of quick wins and quick decisions is quite dangerous. If Japan were to wage a war over the Far East issue in the next one or two years, Japan may win a temporary victory, which is also unknown. However, as a result, Japan will eventually fail. Therefore, if Japan adopts a strategy of quick wins and quick decisions,</p>

<p>then it will inevitably suffer a major counterattack from them in a few years. Recently, Mr. Killeman expressed the opinion that Britain, France, and the United States were originally the guiding countries of the world, and all those who advocate maintaining the status quo oppose the advances of emerging countries. If Europe wants to liquidate and transition the status quo, Britain and France must cooperate with the United States, although they have decided not to use military force to intervene in Japan (at the time of the Manchurian Incident, the United States originally wanted to actively intervene, but it was difficult to achieve because Britain and France did not agree), but they cannot condone Japan. If Europe itself feels a little stable, it will definitely form a military alliance with the United States and jointly launch a crusade to "defeat Japan." However, the victory or defeat must be a long-term war of attrition. However, if Japan has no war in ten years, it will inevitably develop infinitely, and the result is really frightening.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Philippine Issue: The United States Must Decide on a Concrete Policy: The Philippines for Filipinos or the Philippines for Japanese? General Johnson Issues a Warning Urging the US Government to Take Precautions <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(New York) General Johnson announced today that if the Philippines secedes from the United States, Japan will eventually rule the Filipinos. Therefore, the US government should immediately decide on a concrete policy on this matter. Johnson is the former director of the Rehabilitation Administration and is now expressing his views in the newspapers, strongly criticizing the recent riots in the Philippines as unworthy of attention, but believes that this matter has a major impact on the future of the Philippines. Mr. Johnson also said that news in the Washington newspapers said that the riots in Manila were like a flash in the pan and had nothing to do with Japan. This is really an ignorant talk. If this riot is a revolution, it may not shock us, but since there are Tokyo officials instigating it, it does not seem to be a gesture, but a symptom, which is really worthy of our attention. The so-called "Japan does not want to accept the Philippines as a gift, the Filipinos can unite and be qualified for independence, and we can withdraw calmly without causing danger" is pure deception. Moreover, the Philippines has the most fertile land, but the United States does not intend to occupy the land permanently, so it has not been developed. The Philippines is the Philippines for Filipinos. This is our policy. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that only the power of the Americans can prevent it from becoming the Philippines for Japanese. Our country should withdraw from the Philippines, but if we fail to immediately decide on a concrete policy for the Filipinos, it will definitely cause future disputes. On the day we withdraw, there will definitely be civil unrest in the Philippines. At that time, Japan, which considers itself the master of Asia, will take the opportunity to invade under the pretext of maintaining East Asian peace. Therefore, we should decide as soon as possible whether our responsibility is to prevent this from happening. (National News dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to news released by the official circles today, the cotton textile industry committee of the Commercial Advisory Council has drafted several recommendations, one of which advocates establishing a gentleman's agreement with Japan in order to reduce Japanese cotton goods exports to the US. At the same time, it is heard that Japan, at the suggestion of its government, or initiated by Japanese factories themselves, has drafted a method to gradually reduce cotton goods exports to the US. Therefore, the export figures for May may reflect the impact of this policy. It is heard that the US Cotton Textile Industry Committee has also put forward an important recommendation, advocating giving subsidies to US cotton goods exporters, similar to those given to US agricultural products exporters in the past.

<p>(London) The world's attention is currently focused on two major diplomatic conferences being held simultaneously today: the Italy-Austria conference held in Florence, Italy, and the France-Poland conference held in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg discussed the Danube River Conference for about two hours in the Italian seaport. The most important thing they discussed was the Danube River Conference. Polish Foreign Minister Beck and French Foreign Minister Laval had talks for two hours this morning, and they will meet again in the afternoon. The scope and nature of the issues discussed should be greater than those discussed by Italy and Austria. (National News dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: French Foreign Minister Laval has arrived here today. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and other important officials greeted him at the airfield. People view Laval's visit here as even more important than his visit to Moscow. Laval's mission is to dispel the misunderstandings between France and Poland caused by the recent Polish-German Treaty and the Russian-French Mutual Assistance Treaty, and to make Franco-Polish relations turn from cold to hot. (Reuter's dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: French Foreign Minister Laval arrived here at 6 pm this afternoon. Those who came with him were Laval's beloved daughter, Jose, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Reire, and Confidential Secretary Roshal. Foreign Minister Burke, French Ambassador Larooche, and many Polish dignitaries all greeted him at the station. Considering that the crowds at the central station were too crowded, the authorities, for safety reasons, specially drove Laval's special train to the East Station. After Laval got off the train, he went to the Europa Hotel in the same car as Foreign Minister Burke. The French delegation stayed there. In the evening, Burke hosted a banquet to welcome Laval and his party. The formal talks will begin tomorrow morning. Tonight, Laval gave a radio broadcast speech, saying, "I am commissioned by the French government to visit Warsaw and Moscow, and indeed to promote the organization of a collective security system in Europe, and to make it easier for European nations to approach each other. In short, the policy adopted by France is not against any country, but to unite all countries to jointly consolidate peace. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: French Foreign Minister Laval paid a visit to Polish Prime Minister Slavik this morning, and together with Foreign Minister Pak, paid a visit to President Mościcki.

<p>Bucharest: The Balkan Entente countries, namely Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey, held a meeting here this afternoon to discuss political and economic issues. It is believed that the conference will decide to oppose the restoration of the Austrian Habsburg dynasty unless sufficient guarantees are obtained from the great powers. Furthermore, they will oppose the rearmament of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria. The participation of prominent French politician Peng Gu shows France's particular concern about the outcome of this conference. There is talk that the French Legation in Romania will be upgraded to an embassy. King Carol of Romania will soon reciprocate with a visit to Paris. These two actions will deal a blow to the pro-German movement in Romania. It is also hoped that the conference will negotiate a clearing system to replace financial remittances until international exchange difficulties are eliminated. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The political conference of the Balkan Entente countries held its first meeting yesterday afternoon, lasting until 9:30 PM.

<p>(Berlin) The declaration by German Aviation Minister Göring, as reported by the London Daily Telegraph and other newspapers, has been denied today by the semi-official news agency. According to Göring's alleged declaration, future Germany should adopt a "two-country air force" policy, meaning that its air force should be able to withstand the combined action of the air forces of two countries simultaneously. It is reported that Göring never made this declaration in a public gathering, nor did he mention it in any other context. Furthermore, the German government never harbored such illusions. Therefore, the reports in the British newspapers are purely unfounded. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Paris Echo received a message from its London correspondent stating that Britain and France are about to jointly negotiate with Italy, requesting the speedy organization of a mixed arbitration committee to resolve the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. Italy is determined to annex the Harar and Ogaden provinces belonging to Abyssinia by force, so that the Italian Eritrean and Somali colonies in Africa can be connected. The impact of this is that the French port of Djibouti will be separated from the African interior, and the source of the Nile River will also fall under Italian control. Britain fears that the Manchurian Incident will be repeated today, dealing another fatal blow to the League of Nations. Furthermore, because the situation in Europe is very serious, if Italy withdraws its military forces for use in Africa, its chances of success are uncertain. If Sweden invades Austria, Italy will also have no time to take care of it. This is not considered a good plan by Britain. In addition, Italy has repeatedly stated that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute is not something the League of Nations should interfere with and should be handled solely by Italy, which is also not something Britain can agree to.

<h3 id="e62">Abyssinia: Lodges Strong Protest with Italy; Denies Purchasing Large Quantities of Munitions <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian Undersecretary of the Colonies Lessona recently gave a speech accusing Abyssinia of violating the Italian-Abyssinian Treaty of Friendship, and calling Abyssinia an orderly slave-trading country. The Abyssinian government has therefore lodged a strong protest with the Italian Legation in the Abyssinian capital, and denied Lessona's claim that Abyssinia has recently imported large quantities of munitions to bombard white Italians. Government circles have remained silent on the matter of arms shipments to Abyssinia, but it is generally believed that the Italian government has informed Britain and France of the matter, as Britain and France signed a treaty with Italy in 1930 regarding the issue of arms shipments to Abyssinia. It is reported that several governments concerned with this matter have agreed to control the war materials being shipped to Abyssinia after being requested by the Italian government to pay attention to the matter.</p>
<p>According to the semi-official Italian newspaper, the Abyssinian army is currently concentrated in two major areas directly facing Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, and can be rapidly increased by local leaders or by lighting fires on mountaintops. Women and slaves are also being conscripted, and rifles and bullets have been distributed, along with the announcement of assembly points along the roads. An airfield is being hastily built near the border of Italian Somaliland, and a new radio station has been built, expanding telegraph communications. People are required to pay a war tax of one dollar each. A large army is also gathering along the 8,000-mile Italian border from British Somaliland to Kenya, which makes the Italians particularly uneasy. Germany is currently supplying Abyssinia with large quantities of ordnance and chemicals, including rifles, machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, armored vehicles, and Junkers aircraft. The newspaper also revealed alarming figures for the rifles, machine guns, and bullets that have been imported into Abyssinia since the beginning of this year, with payment made over nine years in Abyssinian products, coffee being the main item. The newspaper continued, saying that those who supply Abyssinia with war materials include several countries that benefited from Italian assistance in the European War. They apparently do not realize that the arms that the Abyssinian people are using today to resist Italy may also be used to resist them in the future. The newspaper concluded by saying that everyone knows about Abyssinia's greed for land and its desire to obtain access to the sea. All European countries that are related to Abyssinia's current dangerous situation and possible future developments cannot shirk the responsibility of direct involvement in the conspiracy. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) War in Abyssinia is inevitable. Italy is currently concentrating a large army to advance on Abyssinia, and the Abyssinian King will also mobilize his troops. According to a telegram from the Abyssinian capital received here today, if Italy does not immediately cease its demonstrative military preparations, the Abyssinian army will issue a mobilization order. Italy has more than one million troops. The Italians have not forgotten the past when the Abyssinian army killed and ate 1,800 Italian soldiers in a battle at the end of the 19th century. The Italian army is already prepared for battle, with a strength of 100,000 troops, 300 Fascist Party soldiers, and 75,000 pistol squads. Mussolini has already dispatched 100,000 men to land in Eritrea, an African colony bordering Abyssinia, where conflicts have occurred frequently recently. A Roman semi-official newspaper today published an article criticizing European arms dealers for helping the Abyssinian King prepare for war, stating that European manufacturers have shipped 10,000 rifles, 2 million bullets, 200 machine guns, and other military supplies to Abyssinia, and that Germany is also involved. Swedish military factories have supplied poison gas for chemical warfare, and are now preparing to supply rifles, machine guns, tanks, and military aircraft. (National, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) The "Daily Herald," the organ of the Labour Party led by Prime Minister MacDonald, recently published a commentary stating: "The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is the most noteworthy sign of the League of Nations regaining authority in Europe. All those who are enthusiastic supporters of the League of Nations, and who hope to seize the opportunity to promote peace on the existing foundation of the League of Nations, should take the provisions of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty as a model and compare it with the pre-war Franco-Russian alliance treaty. The new Franco-Soviet treaty is not only within the framework of the League of Nations but also includes almost all the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant." The newspaper continued: "Britain and France have finally reached a mutual understanding. France deeply understands that the principle of automatic mutual assistance is difficult to reconcile with the democratic supervision of foreign policy, while Britain has now realized the danger of a lack of security guarantees. From now on, Britain and France will argue less and consult more." (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The congressional dispute over the banking bill has now moved to the Senate. Eccles, the new head of the Federal Reserve Board, told the Senate today that to promote national recovery, the US lending and monetary policies must be publicly managed. The Federal Reserve System should never become a football of partisan politics or an engine of inflation. When senators asked about the Bartman veterans' bonus bill that stipulates the issuance of $200 million in new currency to pay the bonus, Eccles replied that there is no urgent need to issue new currency now. Even if it were issued, it could not be put into circulation. Any plan that could create a panic mentality would be inflationary. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to the Department of Agriculture's estimate today, as of May 1, wheat production only reached 431,637,000 bushels, or 75% of normal production. Since US national wheat consumption is over 650,000,000 bushels, this year's production is insufficient to meet the people's food needs. This situation is unprecedented in modern US history, and the reason is the drought. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Byrd, the first man to fly over Antarctica, returned today from his Antarctic exploration. President Roosevelt personally welcomed him to congratulate him on his success and held a grand banquet at the White House to entertain him. Byrd will stay at the White House tonight. On December 22, 1933, Byrd led an expedition into uncharted waters, exceeding the record of Captain Cook in terms of distance. He then left the ship and flew to 70 degrees South latitude, traveling back and forth in the ocean without seeing the shore. On January 3, 1934, he flew over the Antarctic ice pack without seeing the Antarctic coast. On January 9, he discovered Little America as a continuous landmass. On January 30, the ship reached Whale Bay. On March 27, due to ice breaking, it was difficult to move forward. Byrd then stayed 123 miles south of Little America for several months, engaged in research. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Overview of Shaanxi's Products</p>
<p>Shaanxi's products: The Guanzhong and Hanzhong areas have fertile land, with agricultural and forestry products being the most abundant. The Shaanbei area has vast land and sparse population, with coal, tung oil, fur, and other products being abundant everywhere. According to the Construction Department's survey in 1933, wheat production was the highest, accounting for over 48% of the total grain production, totaling more than 1.3 million dan. Next were beans, barley, rice, and other miscellaneous grains, also totaling more than 1.3 million dan. The fragrant rice and black rice produced in Nanzheng have a clear fragrance and taste. The cooked rice produced in Wangqu Town, Chang'an, can expand three times its volume when cooked, which can be called a special agricultural product. In the same year, according to the 37 counties surveyed, cotton fields accounted for just over 9% of all cultivated land. According to the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Economic Commission, the increase in cotton fields in Shaanxi Province last year (1934) was as high as 80% compared to the previous year (1933), with a total harvest of more than 1,004,000 dan of cotton, an increase of 95% compared to the previous year. The land in the Luohe area is even more fertile than that in the Jinghui area. In the future, when the Luohe Canal is completed and tobacco planting is prohibited, the surge in agricultural products, especially cotton, will be even more considerable. However, although Shaanxi Province produces abundant cotton, there is not a single textile factory to utilize the excellent raw materials locally. The hand-woven native cloth is all made using outdated methods, resulting in the undervaluation and export of raw materials, the import and sale of foreign cotton cloth, and the people of the province suffering from economic exploitation through scissors differences. The discussions about establishing a yarn factory in Shaanxi have a history of thirty or forty years. During that time, there were cases of promoters running away with the funds, leading to repeated attempts and failures. A few years ago, several wealthy businessmen planned to raise shares to establish a factory, which was named the Yutai Spinning Mill. It is hoped that it can be realized soon. Also, every time the Hui Canal is constructed in Shaanxi Province, local powerful people invariably compete to buy land at high prices, and the new and old landlords raise rents on the pretext, making it impossible for many small and medium-sized farmers who are tempted by high prices or subjected to economic pressure to become tenant farmers after selling their land. Furthermore, poor small farmers find it difficult to obtain loans directly from banks, and they often obtain loans indirectly, with the interest rate increasing invisibly in the process. This is regrettable.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province's forest products, such as pear, jujube, peach, apricot, grape, and other vegetable trees, are found in many places. Forests of timber such as pine, cypress, elm, and walnut are abundant in the Qinling and Bashan Mountains. Among them, the lacquer tree is a special product, producing more than 100,000 catties of lacquer annually, worth more than 130,000 yuan. Tung trees produce 160,000 catties of oil, worth 60,000 yuan. The two items are worth about 200,000 yuan in total, which is a major income for the counties in the Hanzhong area. The mushrooms attached to forests and pear orchards in various places are excellent for making delicacies. More than 1.5 million catties are exported annually. Mushrooms grow on decaying wood and are brown-black or yellow-white in color. The planting method involves cutting the wood into sections and placing them horizontally in a shady place without fertilization. Mushrooms will grow within a year, and production lasts for three years. After that, they turn red and yellow. After drying, they smell like sweet osmanthus and are called osmanthus ear, and are priced higher than black ear. If the black ear naturally mutates into white ear, it is also called silver ear, and each catty costs as much as several dozen yuan. However, once silver ear is produced, it will not grow again the following year. Many people raise silkworms in the Hanzhong area of southern Shaanxi. In the past, they were sold to Sichuan and Gansu provinces, reaching 700,000 to 800,000 yuan annually. They are also occasionally raised in Chang'an, Dali, Luochuan, and Yichuan counties.</p>
<p>The first mineral to be mentioned is petroleum. Oil areas are distributed in the counties of Yanchang, Fushi, Zhongbu, Yijun, Jiaxian, and Mizhi. Forty or fifty oil springs have emerged one after another, mostly flowing out of rocks or floating on the surface of the water from the bottom of ditches and rivers, like dewdrops. Residents in the Han and Tang dynasties had already used it to treat diseases and for burning. A factory was established in Yanchang during the late Qing Dynasty and has been in operation for thirty years, but it has not been very effective due to insufficient capital and poor machinery. In recent years, the average monthly oil production has been: 7,200 catties in the 16th year (monthly), 1,016 catties in the 17th year, 29,207 catties in the 18th year, 15,207 catties in the 19th year, 9,385 catties in the 20th year, 7,013 catties in the 21st year, and 6,098 catties in the 22nd year. The production in the 18th and 19th years was relatively abundant, while the oil production in the 21st and 22nd years suddenly decreased. The National Defense Design Committee has recently invested 100,000 yuan to operate it, and it is reported that production has increased again. The future is very promising. This spring, national tomb-sweeping was promoted, and the Xian-Yulin Highway was rushed to Zhongbu County, where the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum is located. It will soon be open to Yanchang. It is hoped that the mining industry will take advantage of the convenience of transportation to plan the establishment of a large-scale oil factory, purchase new machines, increase production, and refine high-quality products to solve the fuel problem in the Northwest and supply the automotive and other industrial equipment. Coal mines are produced in both northern and southern Shaanxi. The coal produced in Hancheng Tongguan is of the best quality. The Anzishan coal in Hancheng is smokeless coal. If a light railway can be laid or the Yellow River waterway can be improved and transported to Tongguan to connect with the Longhai Railway, there will be no obstacles between east and west. It is not difficult to keep pace with Kai Feng and Zhong Yu. Iron ore is produced in Lantian, Zhen'an, Yao County, Fengcheng, Hancheng, Shi Ji, Ankang, and Liu Ba counties. The iron ore in Tiedonggou, Zhen'an is especially good. The mining area extends along the mountain for about dozens of miles. The ore is in the form of scattered blocks. Locals mine it and set up smelting furnaces, which can produce more than a thousand catties of wrought iron per day. Other minerals such as Lantian jade, Xunyang lead and copper, Nanzheng placer gold, Shangxian asbestos, Qinling jadeite, Lueyang mercury and Jia Yu stone, Fu County and Xionger Mountain silver mines, Xiao Shan jasper crystal, Tongguan magnetic glaze pottery clay, Nanzheng and Ankang fossils are too numerous to mention. Unfortunately, most of them have not been developed.</p>
<p>The northern counties of Shaanxi Province have always produced fur, and the fur-making industry is most prosperous in Dali. Dali was the seat of Tongzhou Prefecture in the past. Sheepskins produced in the northwest provinces are concentrated here, tanned into fur, light and soft, also known as Tongzhou fur. The annual output is about 100,000 pieces, and the business reaches 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Because sales are not smooth now, it is difficult to compare to the past. Other areas such as Yulin, Fushi, and Dingbian counties produce tiger, leopard, wolf, fox, and other hides, as well as saddles, camel gear, and other items, worth 60,000 to 70,000 yuan annually. The annual output of leather, shoes, belts, saddles, and other products in Chang'an is worth more than 50,000 yuan. Qian County and Weinan counties produce about 20,000 catties of leather rope annually, worth more than 10,000 yuan. The annual output of leather materials in Pucheng and Chunhua is about 60,000 yuan. In addition, the value of woolen fabrics, colored felt, plush carpets, wool pockets, and other woolen textiles produced in Chang'an, Baishui, Fufeng, Hengshan, Sanyuan, Yulin, and Yao counties totals 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. The total value of the above-mentioned fur products, which were previously sold to Tianjin and transported to Guanwai, reached about one million yuan annually. Since the September 18th Incident, sales in Tianjin have been sluggish, so the fur textiles have gradually declined.</p>
<p>The geology and climate of the northern Shaanxi area are quite similar to those of Inner Mongolia. It used to be very suitable for animal husbandry. Now, not only is there nothing to praise, but even the number of livestock used for agriculture in the province is decreasing day by day. According to the survey and statistics of the Construction Department, the number of cattle, horses, and donkeys needed for agricultural use in each county is 365,107. The total number of livestock actually available is only 210,255, and the number of livestock lacking is 154,381. Of the 37 counties surveyed, only two counties have a sufficient number of livestock, and the average number of livestock lacking in each of the remaining 35 counties is as high as more than 4,410. The impact on agricultural work can be easily inferred. The provincial government has now planned to establish one livestock farm and one horse farm each and has requested the Ministry of Industry to send experts to guide them. This matter is extremely important, especially in the northern counties of Shaanxi, where the land is vast and the population is sparse, which has always been difficult to govern. Now that the provincial government is promoting animal husbandry to increase the production of farmers, this is the best way to stabilize society.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province was the capital of the Zhou and Qin dynasties, but the geographical advantages have not been fully developed. In addition, due to the soldiers, bandits, and droughts from the 15th to the 18th and 19th years of the Republic, the population of the counties has decreased significantly. In the northern Shaanxi area, in the counties north of Fushi, the total population is only 30,000 to 40,000 in areas with hundreds of miles, and few exceed 50,000 to 60,000. Even in the Hanzhong River basin in southern Shaanxi, although the mountains, rivers, customs, and products are no less than those in the Jiangnan region and the products are as rich as those in Sichuan Province (Hanzhong used to belong to Sichuan. Because northern Shaanxi is relatively cold, especially in the Yulin area, which is as hot as burning in summer and as cold as bone in winter, and the wind and sand are wilderness, similar to desert land, Hanzhong was divided to Shaanxi during the provincial division for adjustment), the population density is still lower than that of the southeastern provinces, and there are barren lands waiting to be cultivated and mineral resources waiting to be developed in the counties in southern and northern Shaanxi. According to the survey of the area of ​​official, public, and private wasteland in 15 counties including Pucheng, Heyang, Shang County, Long County, Xie County, Sanyuan, E County, Lantian, Chaoyi, Yang County, Liuba, Fushi, Zhongbu, Luochuan, and Yanchang in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the total area reached 588,247 mu. There are unknown numbers in other areas that have not been surveyed. Most of the wasteland is in areas where the local people are poor and the people's livelihood is painful, and the natural resources are the most abundant. If the government can sincerely and powerfully immigrate and reclaim the land, provide financial assistance, give them time, and let them use the harvest for themselves, while the government maintains the barren years, not only will the people who have lost their land and jobs respond in unison and rush to it together, but also the practical problems of developing the Northwest and consolidating border defenses will be more than half solved.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Henan Province: Agricultural Revitalization Plan for Hua County, Drafted by the Revitalization Committee Member and the Magistrate of Hua County <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Henan Provincial Revitalization Committee member Xia Chongjiu and Hua County Magistrate Xie Suian believe that Hua County has suffered severely from the flood. Now that the breach has been closed, they have formulated the Hua County Yellow River Disaster Relief and Agricultural Revitalization Plan to carry out post-disaster work. The plan is as follows: "In August of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the Yellow River breached at Shitou Village, Changyuan County, Hebei Province. Fortunately, it was closed in February of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), lasting more than half a year, with losses of more than 20 million, and the disaster was unprecedented in history. Just as we were looking forward to recuperating and slowly recovering, in August of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the breach occurred again, and half of Hua County was still trapped in the raging waves. The Yellow River was surging, with a great tendency to move north and change its course. Although it was closed again in April of this year, the water flow was cut off. Except for the fifth district of the county, where the terrain is slightly lower and the Liuqing River is silted up, and there is still water with a depth of three to two feet, most of the farmland has dried up. However, when it comes to returning to farming, seeds, farming tools, cattle, farmhouses, and drainage all require funds. After the disaster, how can we bear this? If we do not raise a large amount of agricultural revitalization funds to provide relief, I am afraid that the rural areas will eventually go bankrupt and there will be no hope of recovery. Committee member Chongjiu was ordered to come to Hua County and, together with County Magistrate Suian, went to the disaster area to conduct a thorough inspection. Now, based on the number of dried-up farmland mu and the amount of funds needed for various post-disaster relief efforts, we have formulated a plan as follows: (1) Number of dried-up farmland mu: According to the flood in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the area is slightly smaller than in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), with an average width of 25 li and a length of 100 li. The disaster area reaches 2,500 square li. About 2,000 square li have dried up. Excluding those that cannot be cultivated due to sand and city construction, village houses, and graves, there are about 1,600 square li of arable farmland, totaling 864,000 mu. (2) Amount of funds needed for various agricultural revitalizations: (A) Seed costs: In addition to land, seeds are the only essential element for farming. According to the price of various types of seeds, an average of 1 jiao 5 fen is required per mu, and 864,000 mu of arable farmland requires a total of 129,600 yuan. (B) Agricultural tool costs: Tools for plowing, sowing, and harvesting are indispensable for farmers. Over the past two years, they have been quickly destroyed by floods, or buried in mud and sand, or eroded by humidity and corrosion, and are useless. They should be purchased as soon as possible to meet urgent needs. According to the average cost of supplementing agricultural tools of 5 yuan per 100 mu, 864,000 mu of farmland requires a total of 43,200 yuan. (C) Cattle costs: According to 864,000 mu of dried-up farmland, about one-third of the farmers with more than 50 mu can find ways to raise money to buy cattle for application. About one-third of those who have strong men can use human power instead of livestock and can barely cultivate and harvest, without the need to plan for them. However, farmers with less than 50 mu and no strong men are unable to buy cattle and cannot use human power instead of livestock. It is impossible to cultivate without lending money to buy cattle. According to two cattle required per 100 mu and a price of 15 yuan per head, the farmers with less than 50 mu and no strong men have about 288,000 mu and require a total of 86,400 yuan for cattle. (D) Farmhouse costs: According to the survey, more than 300 villages have been affected by the disaster this year, with about 30,000 farmers. Most of the original farmhouses have collapsed, and the cost of repairing all of them is too high. Now, one-third of the extremely poor farmers need one farmhouse each, and each farmhouse requires 10 yuan. For 10,000 poor farmers, the total cost of farmhouses is 100,000 yuan. (E) Drainage costs: It is estimated that the existing water area occupies about 500 square li, more than 80% of which is in the fifth district. The sixth and seventh districts also have a little water in the ditches. The reason for the water accumulation is due to the low terrain and the old Liuqing River being silted up by sand. According to the construction plan and drawings of the Liuqing River, a special report was submitted to the provincial revitalization committee last October to request the allocation of funds for construction, totaling 57,228 yuan. If the funds are not easy to raise for a while, some funds can be allocated first to dredge the accumulated water and engage in agricultural work. However, the minimum is 5,000 yuan. The above five post-disaster agricultural revitalizations require a total of 364,200 yuan, all of which are calculated based on the lowest value of important post-disaster matters, and even the extremely poor victims cannot receive the relief. Although the amount is not small, it is because the disaster is too severe. The various funds required by the general majority of ordinary disaster farmers still need to be raised by themselves and are not included."</p>
<h3 id="e98">Shandong Counties Hope for Rain <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Autumn Planting Has Not Been Sown, Wheat Is Dying from Drought, Flour Prices Are Rising, Making Life Difficult for the Poor</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This year, from spring to summer, there has been little snow and rain, resulting in insufficient growth of wheat. Farmers initially hoped for early rainfall so that even if the wheat harvest was poor, they could still hope for the autumn harvest. However, in recent days, not only has there been no rain, but the climate has been hot and dry, with frequent strong winds. The lush wheat seedlings are wilting, and the weak ones are turning yellow and dry. Since the wheat harvest is not expected, the autumn harvest is almost hopeless. Therefore, the hope for rain is like hoping for the age of plenty. According to the investigation, the recent rainy counties in Shandong Province, except for the Zoushengyi area in southern Shandong, the area from Lixia to Dezhou in northern Shandong, Heze in western Shandong, and Rongcheng in eastern Shandong, have not received a drop of rain. A drought is about to form. Many people from the eastern Shandong area who lived in the Northeast have recently returned to their hometowns with their elderly and children, and the population has increased sharply, and food prices have risen sharply, making people's lives even more difficult. Because Jinan City has convenient transportation, there is no shortage of food, but flour prices continue to rise, which is a serious problem for the general poor. In the past three days, the price of first-class flour has risen from two yuan to three yuan and five fen, second-class flour from two yuan and seven jiao to three yuan, and third-class flour from two yuan and six jiao to two yuan and nine jiao. If it does not rain again in ten days, it will not only aggravate the drought, but the price of food will rise to an unknown degree. (8th)</p>

<p>Residents Jin Lianfu and Quan Wangcai, residing in Chijia Lane, outside the West Gate, falsely accused Quan Wangcai's wife of infidelity, summoned their son back to Songjiang, and helped him beat and injure her. The woman, unable to clear her name, committed suicide by taking poison. After the elder brother of the deceased, Liu Meichu, filed a complaint with the county court and after repeated investigations, the facts were clear. A public prosecution was filed for the crime of injury and homicide, and lawyer Peng Zhongjun was appointed as the pro bono defense counsel. The criminal court judge Zhang Yihuang officially sentenced the defendants Quan Lianfu and Quan Wangcai, father and son, to two years of imprisonment each for instigating others to commit suicide, as a warning.</p>

<p>The city river in this county has been silted up for years. Dredging began this spring, supervised by the First District Office under the county government's order. The entire river was divided into six sections. Except for the first section, from Dongmenkou westward to Guangming Bridge, which has already been dredged and completed, and inspected and accepted by engineer Gu Houxi, dispatched by the Construction Department to Songjiang to open the dam, and the fifth section which is currently being dredged, the second section, from Guangming Bridge to the Xichengmenkou section, has been delayed because the head of the section, Yu Guisun, firmly resigned from his position, expressing his negativity. Yesterday, engineer Gu was dispatched by the Construction Department to Songjiang to urge the progress, and with the unanimous appeal of the local gentry, the acting district head Lu convened a meeting of the Erduan section directors today (11th), and Yang Yunsheng was elected as the director. The dam will be built on the 18th. It is reported that the project in this section requires a wage of one dime and six cents for each cubic foot of soil due to the long distance to the soil dumping site. It was previously contracted by Chen Guozhi, who hired workers to undertake the project. The dam construction project was separately contracted by Jiang A'er. The district office has notified them separately according to the decision, and ordered the police to inform the ships docked in the section to relocate on a specific date to cooperate with the project.</p>

The bandits fled to East Taihu Lake. Unexpectedly, yesterday (11th) morning, more than thirty lake bandits were also discovered at Huangjiagang, six or seven miles from Xukou. They were on four boats, lingering there. The eighth team of the Water Police received the report and immediately rushed to suppress them.</p>

<p>Zhou Deming, a poor man from Li Lane on Caishinong near Xidou, returned home in a rickshaw at around 2:00 AM on March 2nd of this year. He asked his wife, Tao, to get up and cook him a meal. Tao could not help but resent him and grumbled, which aroused Deming's anger. The two began to quarrel. Deming grabbed a wooden pillow and struck Tao's head, causing her forehead to be broken. She died shortly after. The murderer, Zhou Deming, was apprehended by the deceased's brother and taken to the police station, then transferred to the local branch court. After investigation by the prosecutor's office, a public prosecution was filed. Yesterday, Judge Liu Bingzhen brought Zhou Deming to court and sentenced him to fourteen years of imprisonment. After the sentencing, he was ordered to be detained and await transfer to prison.</p>

<p>Zhang Yuchang Rice Shop outside Nanmen was robbed of three hundred yuan in cash by notorious thieves You Guozhen, Xu Jinlin, and Wang Xisheng on the evening of the 2nd of this month. At the time, the thieves fled to Zhoupei Bridge, where they were apprehended by the villagers. An old woman, Ren Zhou, was shot and killed by the thieves. The prosecutor's office of the local branch court sent personnel to verify the case. It is reported that You Guozhen, one of the three notorious thieves, is 27 years old and from Tangtou in the northern countryside. He was previously sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for theft and was released from prison last year after serving seven years. Now he has been arrested again for theft, which is truly unforgivable. On the morning of the 10th, You sent a letter from prison to Wu Zhengrong, the chief of political police, claiming that the robbery of Yang Qinghe Silver Shop on Datieqiao Street was his doing. Chief Wu immediately reported the information to Magistrate Yan, who ordered Yao Fusheng, the director of the trial division, to open a court session for trial at 5:00 PM that afternoon. According to You's confession, he and Chen and others robbed Yang Qinghe of two gold bracelets. Wang and Xu were not involved in the Yang Qinghe case. The gold bracelets were taken to Daihai by Chen for exchange, so they did not get any of the stolen money. He also said that he was suffering greatly in prison and hoped to be executed as soon as possible. After the interrogation, he was ordered to be shackled and returned to prison to await verification.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Telegram Requesting a Change in Silk Industry Control <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>This spring, there was a shortage of silkworm eggs, causing unprecedented panic. Farmers from various villages and villagers from Wucheng Yili and other places came to the city in groups of hundreds and thousands to buy eggs, but there were no eggs to buy. Some traveled dozens of miles back and forth four or five times, but still returned empty-handed, which led to the destruction of the silkworm egg retail outlets and the silkworm model area. The local county chamber of commerce is currently handling spring relief. From time to time, farmers who raise silkworms come to the association to cry about the difficulty of buying eggs. They believe that at a time when rural areas are bankrupt and the region is still raising funds, everyone hopes that the spring silkworms will have a harvest, which may slightly relieve their suffering. However, the silkworms are being abandoned on the ground and cannot be used for production. If a remedy is not sought immediately and left to develop freely, it will not only harm the silk industry, but also have a huge impact on the region. Therefore, the four points of the Construction Department's poor control over silk and the main reasons for the current shortage of silkworm eggs are put forward: (1) Healthy improved silkworm eggs should be produced as much as possible and should not be restricted. (2) The price of the eggs should be purely based on the amount of production and should not be overly restricted. (3) The purchase and sale of eggs should be absolutely free. (4) The dry orchid improvement fee should be exempted, and the funds should still be used by the agricultural farms in various counties to provide silkworm breeding guidance. The above four points were telegraphed to the Construction Department of the provincial government yesterday, requesting that the original control measures be cancelled as soon as possible, in order to save the silk industry and benefit the region. Otherwise, the rural economy will collapse faster, and the industrial and commercial sectors will be severely hit.</p>

<p>The Houmei Business Group branch in the Seventh District was reorganized in October last year, with Xu Jinying as the team leader, Xu Shijun as the chairman of the board of directors, and Meng Jiafu and others as directors. Recently, because Meng Jiafu and others opposed Xu Shijun as the chairman, the group headquarters convened a meeting of merchants and residents from the 9th to the 11th to resolve the issue. On that day, villagers gathered, and fights broke out. The group headquarters ordered the business group to maintain order. However, Meng Jiafu and others formed a patrol team and placed Team Leader Xu under house arrest in the town office. The business group branch disobeyed the order. Yin Zhongren, the head of the general group, reported the matter to Magistrate Yan, who immediately sent a company of the 11th Security Brigade and more than 100 policemen from the Public Security Bureau to the countryside to suppress the situation. In the evening, District Head Shen Songsheng mediated the situation, Team Leader Xu resigned, and the situation was awaiting reorganization. The major dispute was brought to an end.</p>

<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 10th. Chairman Xu Juxi proposed that various industries have repeatedly requested a reduction in the amount of business tax. What should be the response? It was decided that the situation of various industries is worse year by year, and they are at the point of collapse. The association should, based on the requests of various industries, send a letter to the Business Tax Bureau, requesting them to consider the difficulties of businesses and make special arrangements to reduce the amount of collection. Secondly, it was proposed that the canal construction relief office originally planned to dredge the West Canal, but the canal surface was too narrow. It was agreed to widen and deepen it. How should the required supplementary funds be raised? It was decided that the association should discuss the widening and deepening methods with the construction relief office, and the required supplementary funds should be raised by the industries in the west of the city.</p>

<p>Liu Puchen, the special envoy for the Dalai Lama's memorial service, accompanied Special Envoy Huang Musong to Tibet in April of the 23rd year. After the memorial service was completed and the special envoy returned to Nanjing, the government telegraphed Liu to be stationed in Tibet permanently to handle all matters. Unfortunately, he fell ill due to overwork and died in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, at Yinshi on January 7th of the 24th year. The acting Tibetan King Reting Hutuktu ordered the lamas of the three major temples to chant scriptures for his soul. When the family members heard the telegram, they followed the etiquette and wore mourning clothes. Friends in Nanjing mourned the death of this worthy man and initiated a memorial service. It is now scheduled to bury Liu's remains near Lhasa on the 12th of this month, so that his glory will last forever. On the same day at 10:00 AM, a memorial service will be held at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center on Zhongshan North Road in the capital to comfort his loyal soul. It is reported that elegiac couplets and sacrificial accounts sent by virtuous people at home and abroad are so beautiful that they are beyond description. Representatives from various places are enthusiastically sent to pay tribute, which is truly a glorious and complete mourning.</p>

<p>Xiba Town in the Second District of this county has about 3,000 households, mostly supervisors. Most of their residences are thatched houses, and fires occur from time to time. On the afternoon of the 7th, a family member of Sun Youfa in Yangjia Wharf was found. The men went to work on the Huai River entering the sea project, and the women went out to gamble, causing their six-year-old child to play with fire at home, which ignited the straw pile and spread to the houses. At that time, the southwest wind was strong, and the fire spread from the south of the street to the north of the street. All the houses close to the neighbors were burned to the ground. Subsequently, the fire brigades went to rescue, and fortunately it was daytime, so they were able to extinguish the fire. However, more than ten houses on the south and north sides of the street were burned, and more than seventy thatched houses were destroyed. More than ten households were affected, all of whom were poor and helpless. After the disaster, all means of livelihood were cut off, and the situation was extremely miserable.</p>

The owner of the shop, surnamed Ma, found out and had people fish him out, but he had already died. His body is now displayed on a bamboo raft, waiting for his sister, who is married in Shanghai, to come to Pinghu to collect the body. When the boat's wake struck him, Lou shouted for help, but the people on the shore thought he was playing and ignored him, resulting in this disaster.</p>

The factory's equipment and the thoroughness of its management are often the best among Shenxin factories. For example, the adjustment of light and air in the factory is in a superior position among the yarn factories in China. The reporters from various newspapers, led by Rong and others, first visited the employee dormitory, employee hospital, employee club, consumer cooperative, barber shop, and school for workers' children and other public welfare and health facilities, and then visited raw materials, roving, yarn, reeling, sizing, warp, weaving, inspection, polishing, singeing, dyeing, printing, and packaging departments. According to the staff who led the visit, the factory originally had 1,000 looms, but they were repeatedly eliminated due to the aging of the machine bodies. There are currently 515 looms. Many of the machines in the yarn spinning workshop were made by Howard &amp; Bullough Acerington, England in 1932, which shows Rong's efforts to rejuvenate himself in the global recession and develop his career. It is heard that the factory also has thousands of the latest silent spindles.

<p>Fuxin No. 2 Factory</p>
<p>After visiting the factory, they passed through Moxianshan Road and entered the Fuxin No. 2 Flour Factory. This factory has a 1,800-horsepower engine to drive various machines in the entire eight-story factory building. All employees are male workers, and the number is very small, because only three to five people are needed to manage each wide floor of machinery. Rong did not report on Fuxin, so we could not know the specific production and sales situation.</p>
<p>Rong's Report</p>
<p>At about 4 o'clock, the reporters returned to the reception room of Shenxin No. 9 Factory for tea and refreshments. In addition to distributing welcome speeches, Rong also made a brief report, saying: "I came to Shanghai at the age of 20. Seeing the situation, I knew that developing the cotton yarn, cloth, and flour business for people's clothing and food was the most important plan. Therefore, I founded yarn factories and flour factories. In 1918, when the European War broke out, I took the opportunity to sell flour overseas, totaling about 800,000 tons, and after making a profit, I expanded and developed, setting up factories in Hankou, Jinan, and other places, which were watched by foreign yarn factories and flour factories. However, in recent years, due to the global recession, my business has inevitably been affected. Although I am still working hard to break through this difficulty, I also hope that all sectors of society can share this heart and jointly seek the development of China's industry. Then I will be very fortunate."</p>
<p>Rong's Speech</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing delivered a welcome speech at the reception for the press yesterday, saying: "I am very honored that you have come today. I rarely have the opportunity to meet with you, so I will briefly describe the establishment of industrial enterprises, the current difficulties, and future hopes. I hope you will listen carefully and teach me. Forty years ago, I saw that imported goods were becoming more and more popular and that profits were flowing out. Therefore, I had the idea of ​​establishing industrial enterprises. At that time, there were not many commercial enterprises in our country, and the number of foreign flour and foreign yarn sold in our country was already large. Therefore, I invited comrades and planned to establish flour factories and textile factories. Up to now, it has been more than 30 years. We have established 12 flour factories and 9 textile factories. The establishment of textile factories is even more difficult than flour factories. In 1915, Shenxin No. 1 Factory was established on Baihe South Road in Shanghai (now divided into eight factories). In 1919, No. 2 Factory was established on Yichang Road in Shanghai. At the same time, No. 2 Factory was established outside the Five-Hole Bridge in Ximen, Wuxi. In 1920, No. 4 Factory was established in Zongguan, Qiaokou, Hankou. In 1925, Deda Yarn Factory in Yangshupu was purchased as the fifth factory, and the sixth factory was rented outside Nandou in Changzhou. Later, the textile industry was affected by the global recession and plummeted. For example, Housheng on Lan Road in Yangshupu, Dongfang on Yangshupu Road, and Erxin were successively liquidated. We resolutely came out to maintain the unemployed workers and reorganized them into Shenxin Nos. 6, 7, and 9 factories. The place where you are invited today is Shenxin No. 9 Factory, which evolved from Sanshin Yarn Factory. Looking back over the past 30 years, I dare not say that I have benefited society and the country, but I have solved the problem of people's clothing and food. I have gone through all kinds of hardships, but I have never dared to slacken in this ambition. Now the textile factory has 590,000 yarn spindles and more than 5,000 looms, and can produce 1,300 pieces of yarn and more than 10,000 pieces of cloth every day and night. Knowledgeable people think that it is difficult to start a business, but they do not know that it is even more difficult to maintain it. Foreign merchants set up factories in our country, implement their economic aggression, and the dumping policy is the only fatal injury to the textile industry. The operating capital and interest rates of foreign factories are very low. The cost of finished goods is light, and sales are easy. There are no capitalists in our country. The establishment of industrial enterprises depends on the financial community. In recent years, cotton has been expensive and yarn has been cheap, and there is no way out for business. The unified tax still has to be paid, and the interest rate cannot be reduced. Only I can say and bear this kind of pain. Last year, there was a problem in our company's financial turnover, and business was difficult. I dared not complain and still took on the burden myself, and I also regarded running a business as my second life. If I do not fight to the end, more than 30 years of hard work will be in vain. Fortunately, the government has a clear understanding and has long had the determination to provide assistance. Although the seventh factory has gone through twists and turns, it has fortunately not stopped work. Although the second and fifth factories have stopped work, they are still trying to resume operations. In the future, the financial community will be able to take into account the endangered textile industry and provide assistance within the possible scope. The bandit suppression work is completed, yarn sales are smooth, and the market will turn for the better, which is also expected. As for raw materials, various provinces and cities have implemented the promotion of mechanical cotton, and the cooperative is the backing for the revitalization of rural areas. In a few years, it will not be difficult to stop the leakage of cotton imports from outside the country. You are engaged in journalism and are the teachers of the people. I am willing to share the responsibility with you for manufacturing and publicizing domestic goods. Shenxin factories are scattered in various places, making it difficult to guide you to visit them one by one, but in terms of work and management, visiting one place in the ninth factory can cover the rest. I also hope to criticize it and improve it further. I am looking forward to it."</p>
<p>Overview of Each Factory</p>
<p>Rong continued to report on the overview of Shenxin factories (comparison between 1922 and 1934): (1) Regarding the machinery of Shenxin factories, in 1922, there were 517,624 yarn spindles, and in 1934, there were 552,716 yarn spindles, an increase of 35,092; in 1922, there were 40,040 thread spindles, and in 1934, there were 49,748 thread spindles, an increase of 9,708; in 1922, there were 2,902 looms, and in 1934, there were 4,872 looms, an increase of 970. (2) Regarding the cotton consumption and output of Shenxin factories, in 1922, 2,080,417 dan of cotton were consumed, and in 1934, 1,052,597 dan were consumed, a decrease of 27,820 dan; in 1922, 306,465 pieces of yarn were spun, and in 1934, 304,567 pieces of yarn were spun, a decrease of 1,898 pieces; in 1922, 1,798,886 pieces of cotton cloth were woven, and in 1934, 2,346,448 pieces of cotton cloth were woven, a decrease of 452,038 pieces; in 1922, 226,646 blankets were woven, and in 1934, 96,986 blankets were woven, a decrease of 129,660 pieces. (3) Regarding the cost of Shenxin factories, in 1922, the raw material foreign cost was 51,417,284.85 yuan, pulling each dan at 47.59 yuan; in 1934, it was 47,338,977.21 yuan, pulling each dan at 44.97 yuan, a decrease of 4,078,307.64 yuan; in 1922, the labor cost was 5,878,440.09 yuan, and in 1934, it was 4,145,686.21 yuan, a decrease of 1,728,754.71 yuan; in 1922, the material cost was 3,002,018.35 yuan, and in 1934, it was 2,188,823.39 yuan, a decrease of 812,194.96 yuan; in 1922, the electricity cost was 2,625,919.33 yuan, and in 1934, it was 2,147,546.99 yuan, a decrease of 478,372.34 yuan. The results can be seen at a glance. According to the reduction of internal expenses of each factory, there are amazing figures, among which labor is the largest, followed by materials, but the interest item not only does not decrease, but also increases by more than 400,000 yuan. This low-interest loan is the urgent need for today's relief of industry and commerce. I hope that the financial community can sympathize with the appeal of various industries and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Shenxin's Position</p>
<p>Shenxin's position in China's textile industry, the total number of yarn spindles, thread spindles, and looms in the country is as follows: (1) Yarn spindles: 4,621,357, of which 2,627,473 are Chinese merchants, 1,790,148 are Japanese merchants, and 182,196 are British merchants. Shenxin accounts for 12% of the total number of yarn spindles in the country and 11% of the total number of yarn spindles in the country's Chinese merchants. (2) Thread spindles: 408,560, of which 135,860 are Chinese merchants and 272,700 are Japanese merchants. Shenxin accounts for 10% of the total number and 37% of the total number of Chinese merchants. (3) Looms: 39,565, of which 19,081 are Chinese merchants and 17,592 are Japanese merchants. Shenxin accounts for 12% of the total number and 26% of the total number of Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Comparison of Expenses</p>
<p>The expenses of each factory, including salaries, insurance, interest, unified tax, and other items, totaled 21,543,924.37 yuan in 1922 and 17,966,691.43 yuan in 1934, a decrease of 3,577,232.94 yuan. Looking at the comparison of the above items, a general overview of the general situation of the company's factories in the past three years can be obtained. However, the following points must be further explained to all sectors of society: (1) In recent years, China's industrial and commercial industries have been frequently affected by the dumping of foreign goods, the decline of rural areas, and the decline of the social economy, and there is a precarious situation. The textile industry has been the most affected. However, the company still adheres to the original intention of promoting domestic goods and engaging in mass production. In this difficult period, it has still worked hard to add 15,090 yarn spindles, 9,708 thread spindles, and 970 looms in the past two years. (2) The company believes that improving the output is the only important plan for the future development of the industry, and reducing expenses to reduce costs is also an urgent task. Looking at the above comparison of items, the company has vigorously implemented a tightening policy without leaving any effort.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Banking and Money Industries Are Proceeding with Credit Loans Separately <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank and the Bank of China to each take on 1 million yuan, the Bank of Communications to take on 500,000 yuan, the Banking Association to take on 1.5 million yuan, and the Money Industry Association to take on 1 million yuan for the 5 million yuan of industrial and commercial credit small loans to rescue the market. Except for the funds taken on by the three banks, which are not a problem, the rest of the banking and money industries are still in the process of raising funds. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Banking Association Representatives Will Be Re-elected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association has previously elected representatives to contact the Central Bank regarding the organization of loan syndicates. Now, with the increase in the amount of funds recognized by member banks, and the addition of 500,000 yuan recognized by various banks with relatively strong capital in addition to the 1 million yuan already recognized, in order to make up the amount of 1.5 million yuan, the amount recognized by each bank has changed from before, and the two representatives previously elected will be re-elected when the 68th executive committee is convened.</p>
<p>Money Industry Leaders Urge Additional Recognition</p>
<p>Yesterday, a gentleman from the money industry told reporters that the business of money houses, according to the "Shanghai Money Industry Regulations" Chapter 3, Business Scope, Article 4, Item 3, and Chapter 9, Various Loans, Article 32, can be said to be based on credit loans. Even if we take the 55 member money houses of the Money Industry Association as an example, the amount of loans has reached about 20 million yuan, with each house having a maximum of more than 500,000 yuan and a minimum of 300,000 yuan. This is why, during the initial consultation on credit loans, it was not advocated to join the banking syndicate again. Later, the Ministry of Finance ordered the association to join immediately with ten principles of credit loans. After the representative meeting on May 2, it was passed to join 250,000 yuan. Now the Ministry of Finance has ordered to raise 1 million yuan. Although the managers' meeting on May 8 decided to continue to recognize 250,000 yuan, Qin Runqing, the chairman of the association, separately consulted with the industry and asked to recognize a certain amount more in order to make up the amount of 1 million yuan. It is likely that this number will be made up.</p>

<p>Using Business Tax as Collateral; the Contract is Said to Have Been Signed</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Zhao Dihua, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department, said that from April to August every year, the time is between the old and new crops, tax revenue is short, and the provincial government's expenses are always insufficient. In April of last year, the department used the province's business tax to borrow 2 million yuan from the Shanghai banking community, which was repaid in monthly installments. It has been fully repaid by February of this year. According to news from the Shanghai financial community yesterday, the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department is now borrowing 1.5 million yuan from the Shanghai, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Jiangsu four banks with the province's business tax as collateral, which will be repaid in eight months. The interest rate remains the same, and the contract has been signed. However, the department has not yet allocated it, preparing to use a part of it as political expenses and a part to organize small loans to help the poor people in the province.</p>

<p>Since Song Ziwen took over as chairman of the Bank of China, he has spared no effort in promoting business. Deposits from all sectors of society have also increased compared to before. In order to develop the domestic economy and regulate agricultural and financial interests, the bank has decided to expand the organization of the savings department.

<p>The Ministry of Communications ordered the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau yesterday, saying: "It is hereby notified by order of the Executive Yuan that when the 18th Advisory Committee on Opium of the League of Nations previously held a meeting, our country's representative Hu Shize stated that at a time when our country is strictly prohibiting opium, a small number of foreigners and foreign ships are found to be privately selling and manufacturing narcotic drugs in China in order to make huge profits and destroy our country's prohibition policy. In order to prevent this, a proposal was submitted to the committee, which was passed and recommended that the Council of the League of Nations transfer it to the governments of all countries with extraterritorial jurisdiction in China for the adoption of three prohibition measures, namely: (1) Those people of each country who participate in the private manufacture or private transportation of narcotic drugs in China shall be severely punished; (2) The ships of each country sailing in China, if found to be used for the private sale of opium, should immediately have their protection revoked. This case has now been formally notified to our country by the Council of the League of Nations, and it shall be implemented immediately. In addition to the Executive Yuan notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately inform the embassies of all related countries in China and the ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments, and taking the third item as within the scope of the Ministry of Communications' authority, it is specially ordered to implement it in accordance with the ministry. Now, a copy of the original measures is specially copied and sent to the bureau and all its subordinate offices.

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Coal Industry Association enclosing samples of delivery receipts and delivery notices from the Da China Coal Ball Company, requesting instructions on stamp tax.

Upon investigation, the sample of the delivery receipt from the Da China Coal Ball Company is equivalent to a delivery invoice, which should be taxed according to regulations. The second copy is the receipt, and the third copy is the stub, both of which can be exempted from taxation according to regulations. The delivery notice contains the phrase "Coal balls of so many tons are paid with this voucher," which is no different in nature from the current regulations for vouchers for various goods issued by shops. The 印花 tax should still be affixed according to regulations. In addition to the fact that the receipt should not be taxed, the tax authority has ordered the Shanghai Concession Tobacco Inspection Office to be notified. This is hereby notified.</p>

<h3 id="e134">The Jin-Engraved Surangama Sutra is Published <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Engraved Song Edition Tripitaka Society previously entrusted Fan Cheng Monk to seek ancient scriptures in Shanxi, and discovered a scroll-style Jin Tripitaka in Zhaocheng, which is an orphan copy unseen in the world. It is a pity that it is incomplete due to the age. In particular, those who commonly chant, such as the Avatamsaka Sutra, the Lotus Sutra, and the Amitabha Sutra, lack the most. Fortunately, the entire Surangama Sutra is complete and flawless, and it was immediately borrowed to Shanghai to be engraved in the original style. Each volume has one side of the original version, with twenty-three horizontal lines and fourteen characters vertical, and is printed with variable-layer fine paper. The inner core is rolled with a round wooden axis, and the outside is tied with bamboo, without losing any authenticity. The content of the scripture is originally刻 accurate, and when compared with the current moment, the differences, additions and subtractions are as many as hundreds of words. The Nanjing National Academy of Chinese Studies Library, the Zhenjiang Shao Zong Library, and the Suzhou Honghua Society all believe that the display and worship are extremely solemn, and the study and recitation are also free from errors. Special introduction, each set of ten volumes, stored in two exquisitely crafted cloth cases, is priced at six yuan, plus postage of 6 corners and 2 points for nonlocal areas. If there are large donations and the purchase of more than ten sets, there are still preferential treatment. The Shanghai Engraved Song Edition Tripitaka Society is at 714 Weihai Road, and its circulation is quite extensive.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Chaozhou Association: Promoting Thrift Among Fellow Villagers - Thrift Society to be Established Today <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Jinzhou Sojourners' Association in Shanghai, in light of the decline in social customs, the extravagance of habits, and the weakening of the national spirit, which are deteriorating daily and greatly impacting the future of the entire nation, has decided to address this downward trend by first promoting thrift among fellow villagers. They are organizing a Thrift Society, establishing Thrift Covenants, widely recruiting fellow villagers as members, and jointly promoting these covenants. The current immediate goal is to improve outdated customs, setting certain standards for weddings, funerals, celebrations, social events, and social interactions, emphasizing simplicity, strongly rejecting hypocrisy, abolishing all outdated regulations, limiting banquets and congratulatory gifts, conserving resources, and avoiding wastefulness. The more than fifty covenants are practical, easy to implement, and promote gradual and sustained progress, aiming to restore China's inherent thrift. After months of preparation, everything is now in order, and the establishment ceremony will be held today (the 12th) at 3 PM at the association's headquarters in Shengping Lane, Gongguan Road, in the French Concession. In addition to the ceremony, members will recite oaths of commitment. It is reported that all Chaozhou compatriots living abroad are welcome to join the society as members, without any fees. The origins of the organization are outlined below:</p>
<p>Since ancient times, our country has been founded on etiquette and moral principles. Social occasions such as weddings, funerals, and celebrations all embody extremely pure and profound meanings. However, in recent times, social customs have deteriorated, habits have become corrupt, and there is a competition for extravagance. Complex and elaborate formalities are merely wasteful and contribute nothing practical, gradually losing their original meaning. The unnecessary waste of time and money is appalling, and the impact on the expression of the entire national spirit is extremely significant. With the eastward advance of Western influence and China subjected to various forms of aggression and oppression by imperialists, etiquette and moral principles have been abandoned, and culture has fallen behind. Instead of adopting the spirit of self-improvement, we have been harmed by the world's material civilization, leading to extravagance, indulgence, and extreme desires, resulting in poverty, violence, brutality, degradation, and various other abnormalities. Society is becoming increasingly hypocritical, the nation is gradually declining, internal problems are intensifying, foreign insults are frequent, the national spirit is weakening, and the country is approaching the brink of collapse. To revive, we must thoroughly cleanse past bad habits and actively renew and strive forward. Therefore, the "New Life" movement is considered by contemporaries to be a way to save the country and strengthen it, which is well-founded. Chaozhou, as an ancient and simple place, has a pure and honest folk style. However, due to prevailing customs, it inevitably follows the trends. This is especially true for fellow villagers living abroad, where extravagance and luxury have become a common practice. This is due to the great influence of the environment. Although a few enlightened individuals have the intention to improve, they are constrained by long-standing habits and intimidated by public opinion, making it difficult to break free. Recognizing this, our association intends to use the power of the group to promote change, organizing the Thrift Society, widely recruiting like-minded individuals, and establishing covenants that are practical and easy to implement, to be observed by all. Through gradual accumulation and sustained effort, we aim to correct deviations, rectify wrongs, and promote renewal, ensuring that acquisition does not harm integrity and giving does not harm generosity, thereby conserving resources, cultivating fine customs, encouraging and assisting each other, and practicing diligently without懈怠. Starting with oneself and influencing others, moving from the shallow to the deep, from the near to the far, and extending to a village and a country, we aim to restore our inherent thrift and become the precursor to national rejuvenation. This is not merely a small contribution to our homeland. This is the reason for the founding.</p>

<p>Zhang Shisheng, also known as Zhiyuan, from Hubei, aged thirty-nine, formerly served as the second-class postmaster in Huangpi County, Hubei. In August of last year, he was discovered to have embezzled public funds. Zhang abandoned his post and fled without a trace. The provincial post office reported this to the Hubei Provincial High Court, which issued an arrest warrant, and also telegraphed various post offices to be vigilant in their search. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Post Office sent a document to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to issue arrest warrant No. 182. Yesterday, police detectives Yang Yilong and Ren Fengwu of the Chinese detective force of the Public Concession General Police Station, discovered Zhang's hiding place. On the day before yesterday, in the afternoon, they, along with postal inspector Lu Youtong, arrested Zhang at the Wanshun Inn at No. 17, Xinkai River. Yesterday morning, they escorted him to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation, stating that the post office had telegraphed the Hubei Post Office the night before, requesting the relevant court to send personnel to escort him back. Therefore, this case should be sent to the Hubei Court for investigation and trial. He requested the court to issue a document to the Hubei court to send personnel to escort him back. When questioned, Zhang Shisheng confessed that he had embezzled over five thousand yuan in public funds due to the entanglements with friends. However, the post office had already disposed of his private property, which was sufficient to compensate for the losses. Judge Shide verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained. If the Hubei court could not quickly come to extradite him, the court would transfer Zhang to the Shanghai Local Court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Jian De Bank Case - Both Sides Seek Amicable Resolution <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>A Glimmer of Hope Appears - Court Grants Postponement</p>
<p>It has been more than half a year since the collapse of Jian De Bank. The responsible directors, supervisors, and managers of the bank, including Chai Chuangui, Li Jingwei, Tu Kaizheng, Chen Xifu, Chai Yousheng, Yan Ziyu, Xie Keming, Ou Jiancheng, Ma Suizhi, Zheng Huaigu, etc., have been using the liquidation process as an excuse to intentionally delay various debts. Although over ten creditors, including Wei Haijiang, Wang Ruyao, Hu Qingxiang, Luo Mingji, Xu Bolun, Zhang Yiyuan, Hu Xinpei, Shao Jiaquan, Xin Ji, and Jiu Feng, etc., have filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against the responsible individuals for fraud and embezzlement, there have been multiple hearings. The defendants either fail to appear under various pretexts, or if they do appear, they shift responsibility to each other. They have refused to hand over crucial account books of the bank, preventing the true cause of the collapse from being determined. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui held another hearing. Few of the ten plaintiffs were present in person, except for Wei Haijiang, who was ill. Even fewer of the defendants appeared in court. Judge Liu, unable to allow the delay to continue, instructed the plaintiffs who were present that the process would now begin with liquidation. However, this type of liquidation would not involve auditing the entire account books of the bank, but only require the defendants to submit relevant account books as quickly as possible based on the claims of each plaintiff. The court would then appoint personnel to conduct the liquidation. The costs of liquidation would be borne by the plaintiffs. He then instructed the lawyer for the defendants to submit the requested account books within two days to one week without delay. He also questioned the lawyer about whether there was a solution for small depositors with detailed debt amounts, such as Hu Qingxiang. The lawyer for the defendants then described the recent consultations with the plaintiffs to reach an amicable resolution, stating that they had repeatedly consulted with Wei Haijiang and others, and that there was a glimmer of hope. This type of resolution was not empty talk and requested a further postponement. The lawyer for the plaintiffs, upon hearing this, immediately stated the plaintiffs' position, believing that if the defendants were truly sincere in reaching a resolution, they should first provide a guarantor. If the funds were not repaid by the agreed-upon date, the guarantor would be responsible. The court instructed the defendants' lawyer to pay attention to the plaintiffs' request for a guarantor. The court then adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it for the afternoon of the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Continued Hearing in the Shun An Ship Case <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Further Investigation Still Needed - Ouyang Tai Remains in Custody</p>
<p>Ouyang Tai, the owner of the Shun An steamship of the Shun An Company, reported to the customs at Sandu Ao, Fujian, in September of last year, that he was instructed by manager Chen Youbai to blow up the ship mid-voyage to obtain insurance money. Because he could not bear the sacrifice of all the lives on board, he surrendered and reported the matter. The customs authorities detained Ouyang Tai and transferred him to the Minhou Local Court. The Shanghai Local Court sent police to bring Ouyang Tai back. The Criminal Division has held repeated investigations without resolution, as detailed in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Criminal Judge Cai Dingcheng held another hearing in the Third Tribunal. For the sake of caution, the judges interrogated the witnesses separately. The first witness, Shi Jiazhuan, manager of Hao Hua Insurance Company, testified that the marine insurance for the goods on the Shun An ship was handled by broker Dong Yulin. If any mishap occurred, the company would work with a public notary to determine the price of the goods. Chen Youbai testified that he did not instigate Ouyang Tai to blow up the ship and that he was being falsely accused. Zheng Akang testified that he had returned to his ancestral home in Fujian on the orders of his brother Zheng Zhongwu (who is the chairman of Shun An Company) to handle his father's funeral. He did not know anything about the ship explosion. Ouyang Tai testified that on September 12th of last year, at about 7 PM, Chen Youbai came to his house and invited him to a private room on the fifth floor of the Yangzi Hotel. He instructed him to sail the ship into the sea and cause it to hit a reef. He also gave him explosives and a water bottle, stating that they would split the profits after the deed was done. He refused, and Chen immediately gave him an insurance policy worth four thousand eight hundred yuan, stating that if he refused, he would be treated in a certain way. At the time, he saw that Chen's words were fierce and his eyes were angry. Fearing immediate rejection might lead to disaster, he vaguely agreed. The next day, the ship left Shanghai and sailed to the middle of the voyage. Zheng Akang, the younger brother of Chairman Zheng Zhongwu, dismantled the telegraph machine and forced him to blow up the ship. He then went to Duwo and reported the matter to the customs. The ship's chief mate, Chen Youxing, and others accompanied him to the customs, which can prove his innocence. If he was indeed an accomplice, why would he surrender and report the matter? He asked the court to investigate. Judge Cai determined that the case still required investigation, ordered Ouyang Tai to be returned to custody, and ordered Chen Youbai and Zheng Akang to remain on bail pending further hearings.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Young Woman Rescued After Jumping into the River <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Describes Overwhelming Hardships</p>
<p>At approximately 8 PM on the night before last, a young woman dressed in short clothes stood on the Baidu Bridge outside the mouth of the Suzhou Creek. Taking advantage of a moment when no one was paying attention, she threw herself into the river to commit suicide. The current was rapid, but fortunately, a cargo ship was approaching. The crew quickly used a bamboo pole to hook her clothes and rescued her. They handed her over to the water patrol officers Nos. 22 and 32, who took her to the Customs Water Patrol Station. After changing into dry clothes, she stated that her name was Shi Eryuan, aged twenty-six, from Hangzhou. She had been married off at the age of seventeen and worked as a boatwoman. After several years of marriage, her husband discovered that she was romantic and held a belief in absolute love. At the age of twenty-one, her husband sent her to Shanghai and sold her to a brothel (commonly known as a "wild chicken coop") as a prostitute. Her husband received 330 yuan for her body, with the understanding that she would be free after four years. During that period, she suffered greatly and deeply regretted her initial mistake in thinking, which led to her abandonment by her husband. She endured a prostitute's life for four years. Only in June of last year did her term expire. Due to financial difficulties at the beginning of the year, she agreed with the madame to continue as a prostitute for some time until she had the opportunity to redeem herself. However, most of her earnings were deposited with the madame. As of recently, she had accumulated about 360 yuan. On the 5th of this month, she asked the madame to return the money, but instead, she was forcibly kicked out. She is now homeless and has gone without food for three or four days. Rather than starving to death, she would rather die sooner. She was overwhelmed with sorrow. The police officer asked her where the brothel was located, and she said it was at No. 18, Shihe Lane, Er Ma Road. An investigator was sent to investigate and the owner of the brothel claimed that the prostitute was suffering from a mental illness and that her claim about the debt was fabricated. The police officer then summoned the woman's landlord, Chen Wangshi, to the station to persuade her to prevent her from taking the same path again.</p>

<p>Quarrel Over Living Expenses - Legal Wife Angered and Sues</p>
<p>He Jingrong, from Nanhai, Guangdong, married Ye Ruizhen, also from the same hometown, seventeen years ago. They have three children together. However, eight years ago, He began a relationship with Li Qunfang. Since then, the legal wife has lived with her children in a separate residence at No. 23, Kejian Lane, Jiaxing Road, while he lives with his concubine at No. 35, Shishan Lane, Dongxi Huade Road. He runs a clothing business in Shanghai and is financially comfortable. Although the wife and concubine live separately, he still bears the living expenses for both sides, giving Ye 45 yuan per month without interruption. As they say, "husband and wife are like firewood and rice," and as firewood and rice were not lacking, there was rarely any dispute. Unexpectedly, last winter in October, Ye's eldest daughter went to Li's place to collect living expenses and was insulted by Li. She told her mother, which greatly angered Ye. A rift developed between the legal wife and the mistress. Recently, Ye hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against He Jingrong, demanding cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Mo Runhua held a hearing. Ye testified that she was thirty-five years old and married He Jingrong at the age of eighteen. She had three children with him: a sixteen-year-old daughter, an eleven-year-old son, and an eight-year-old daughter. He's mistress, Li Qunfang, is twenty-six years old and they have been having an affair for eight years. He has not returned home since he had an affair. Although her living expenses have been paid monthly, his obligation to cohabitate has not been fulfilled for a long time. She now demands that the defendant separate from his concubine and return home to cohabitate with her. When questioned, He Jingrong also admitted to being thirty-five years old and acknowledged the fact that he had been cohabitating with Li Qunfang for eight years. However, he claimed that although he had an affair, he still often returned home and that the plaintiff's demand for cohabitation was not an issue. As for separating from Li, it was not his wish. After the lawyers on both sides debated, the court announced that it would rule on the 15th of this month.</p>

<p>For Revised Method to Handle Accommodation - Application Valid Before the 15th</p>
<p>The city's Social Affairs Bureau, considering the customs of the people's marriage season, originally scheduled the group wedding ceremony to be held every month, and changed it to the first Wednesday of February, April, June, October, and November each year, a total of five times a year. It has been approved by the municipal government and announced to the public. It is reported that the bureau received a request from Yu Yiping, Xu Baogui, etc., who originally planned to participate in the ceremony to be held in July, but were unable to do so due to the revision of the method, and requested permission to participate in the third session. The Social Affairs Bureau, considering that there will inevitably be similar situations at the beginning of the method revision, allowed accommodation for remedial measures. Those who wish to participate in the third session may go to the Social Affairs Bureau to fill in the application form before the 15th of this month, and wait for approval. Overdue will not be accommodated again, because there are still two weeks of public notice period before the wedding, and the time is too late. It is heard that the bureau has announced the above method for public knowledge.</p>

<p>Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, natural location, is extremely superior, but in the past, the contractors were limited by their financial resources, so the equipment management was still lacking. After being taken over by the city this year, the equipment management will strive for perfection, such as the sorting of the beach, the construction of the cafeteria, the installation of shower rooms, the planting of flowers and trees, etc., are all actively underway, and there is also a Xiangzhao, with a lake pavilion in the middle, which is unique in Qingya. The sorting work of Zisha beach has been completed, and the planting of flowers and trees and the covering of grassland will also be completed, but the construction of houses and running water worker rods are underway day and night, and it can be completed in about next month. Once completed, it can be opened. Although the buildings are bungalows, the internal layout is quite complete, including a large dining room that can accommodate 600 people, shower rooms, male and female dressing rooms, male and female toilets, etc., all have everything. The upper cover is made of Spanish-style emerald green tiles, and the distant view and the blue sea and blue sky are of the same color, which is very beautiful. The interior decoration utensils are also ingenious and exquisite, beautiful and comfortable, and special attention is paid to management methods and safety equipment, such as becoming an oriental beautiful seawater bathing beach.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Rickshaw Committee Violates Regulations - Special Zone Owners Held General Meeting Yesterday Morning <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Delegating Five Representatives to Negotiate with the Municipal Council - Stop Paying Membership Fees and Demand Reorganization of the Mutual Aid Society</p>
<p>The rickshaw guild of the Special Zone held an emergency meeting of owners at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. regarding the Mutual Aid Society's non-compliance with regulations, forced collection of mutual aid fees, and rickshaw samples, and issued a declaration. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Meeting Proposals: At 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the guild held a meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Gu Songmao, Wang Kunyi, Jin Chunlin, and others, totaling six hundred, attended. Gu Songmao, Hou Shaoan (Hou Wan'an representing), and Lu Dexin served as the presidium. Wang Yucheng from the Municipal Party Department and Li Ruzhang from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended to provide guidance. Gu Songmao first reported on the negotiations with the Municipal Council. After discussion (1) The Mutual Aid Society has exceeded the trial period, according to the regulations, the rickshaw owners and pullers should be responsible for the guild affairs, but the Rickshaw Committee refused to participate, how should it be dealt with? It was resolved to demand reorganization, and not pay the Mutual Aid Society fees from June onwards. (2) New rickshaw sample case, it was resolved to maintain the old style, with cleanliness and sturdiness as the principle. (3) The rickshaw registration incident case, it was resolved to cancel the registration restriction, in order to maintain the business of the rickshaw owners and the livelihood of the pullers. (4) Nomination of negotiation representatives, it was resolved to nominate Yin Zhiling, Hou Shaoan, Gu Songmao, Wang Kunyi, and Lu Desheng as representatives to negotiate with the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Issued Declaration: The guild issued a declaration saying, "Our Special Zone's public rickshaw owners, since the Municipal Council established the Rickshaw Committee, proposed various suggestions for the new rickshaw industry system last spring. In addition to the first three items being put on hold, the rest, such as reducing the rent, changing the rickshaw samples, rickshaw owner licenses, rickshaw puller registration, etc., were not carefully reviewed, and the Rickshaw Affairs Committee was set up to specialize in its affairs. Not only were the above items implemented one by one, but also the Mutual Aid Society was set up, and the expenses required were the responsibility of the rickshaw owners to raise from the pullers, and ordered to pay in advance, regardless of damaging the rickshaw case and exploiting the pullers, and arbitrarily acted on their own. The representatives of the industry have repeatedly stated their grievances and requested improvements, which were ineffective, causing great indignation, so that both sides insisted, and the situation was very serious. On August 6th of the same year, the Municipal Council convened a meeting of the Rickshaw Committee and rickshaw merchants, and the result of the discussion was that all the agreed-upon methods, regarding the Mutual Aid Society, were resolved to try for eight months. Now that the trial period of the guild has expired, examining the past situation, all are showy and grandiose, in order to position private individuals and chat to decorate the facade, the money obtained by gathering sweat is all spent without名无买, and there is no indication of what the pullers urgently need. The representatives of the industry made reasonable and well-intentioned recommendations and repeatedly suggested to Chairman Mai of the guild to amend the constitution, in order to enhance the ability to do things and conform to the original intention of benefiting the society. Unexpectedly, the chairman stubbornly held his own opinions and did not adopt them. He was arrogant and did not allow others to participate in the deliberations. Although the representatives of the industry are members of the guild's board of directors, it seems that they are not allowed to consult any guild affairs at all. Thinking that the guild is called the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid, examining the name and studying the nature, the pullers and related rickshaw owners should be consulted and handled, and it is by no means that administrative personnel can manipulate it at will, but they actually concurrently assume the special power, forming a monopoly, and to this extent, how can its oppression be imagined? As for the new rickshaw sample, it needs to be agreed by the rickshaw merchants, with firmness, simplicity, and hygiene as the main points, and not focusing on flashy and other styles, which is recorded in the agreement of August 6th, and can be examined. However, the Rickshaw Committee first came up with its own unique ideas and manufactured rickshaw samples that were not suitable for public use, without giving the parties concerned sufficient consideration. More than 130 rickshaws that were pried were ordered to imitate and drive, although the rickshaw owners explained in detail how the new rickshaws were floating, not firm, and how heavy they were, the Rickshaw Committee turned a blind eye, and after feeling that it was not applicable, they did not think of thoroughly reforming it, and still followed the gourd, slightly changing it, and did not publicly discuss it with the rickshaw owners from beginning to end. Various measures show that the Rickshaw Committee violated the provisions of the equal agreement of August 6th last year. Our rickshaw owners are under this mandatory policy, and the business is declining day by day. The indignation is inevitable. The whole assembly is gathered to discuss the main points to deal with as follows: (1) The Mutual Aid Society is organized freely and independently by the paying pullers and responsible owners, and the members of the Rickshaw Committee must not concurrently hold the Mutual Aid Society affairs, so as to prevent despotism. (2) The amount of mutual aid should be discussed and determined by the pullers and the owners to determine an appropriate limit. (3) The new rickshaw sample must seek the consent of both the owner and the puller, and must not be determined by the Rickshaw Committee, so as to be suitable for public use. The above points are the legal struggle of our colleagues. We respectfully request all chambers of commerce, all colleagues, and all sectors of society to unite and help, and this is declared for your reference."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Hutchinson's Search of Pharmacy Case - Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks Municipal Council to Prosecute <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Safeguarding Business Safety of Merchants and Citizens</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, stating that a Russian, Hutchinson, arbitrarily searched the Jihua Pharmacy, and asked the Public Concession Municipal Council to investigate. Then, it received a reply from the Municipal Council, stating that Hutchinson was not a staff member of the bureau. The Chamber of Commerce then sent a letter to the bureau, stating that Hutchinson should be prosecuted according to the law. The letter said, "Respectfully, I have received your bureau's reply to the Jihua Hall Pharmacy matter of the 8th of this month. After checking this matter, according to what is said in your reply, then the Hutchinson is not a staff member of your bureau, and it is said that there was a similar case in the Hongkou Police Station in the past. It can be seen that Hutchinson is indeed a person who is not at peace. It can be seen that he went to the Jihua Hall Pharmacy this time and caused trouble under a false name, and there is a suspicion of trespassing into people's houses and attempted extortion. The police station in charge did not find out Hutchinson's nationality and charged him with the due guilt in the court in charge, which did not fulfill his duty to protect the business safety of merchants and citizens. The corresponding letter is sent to your bureau for inspection and handling, and I hope to see the reply."</p>

<p>Local and Foreign, and Nanyang Parties Send Letters and Telegrams to Discuss - Request to Participate in Establishment and Promote Domestic Goods</p>
<p>The Citizens' Domestic Goods Society, originally scheduled to be established at the Shaoxing Association, Faerjin Road, at noon today (12th), has completed most of the procedures. However, after the news came out, because it was a patriotic work, it aroused the attention of major industrial and commercial firms in the local area and compatriots in the Nanyang Islands who were running domestic goods businesses. Therefore, since the 9th of this month, the society has received many letters and telegrams, asking to attend the ceremony to discuss and promote domestic goods, and requesting a postponement. The enthusiastic situation is rare. Now, the society has considered the situation and believes that it cannot be refused, so it held an emergency temporary meeting at 5:00 p.m. yesterday to decide to postpone it in order to accommodate all parties to participate and expand the scope.</p>

In the end, due to insufficient physical strength, the treatment was ineffective, and he passed away at 7:40 pm on May 10th, at the age of 47. Mr. Xi was loyal, upright, capable, generous, and righteous. Therefore, his family was poor after his death, leaving behind five children, all of whom are in school. His friends all regretted that Mr. Xi could not live forever.

<p>Head Burned, Limbs Incomplete; Name Unknown, a Very Tragic Sight</p>
<p>In the Dachangxiang South Goods Store, a double-front store opened by Gong Wenxiang, a Chongming native, located at Nos. 252 and 254, the corner of the South Railway Station Road behind the South Railway Station of the local court on Yuannan Station Road, a fire broke out suddenly at 1:35 the night before. In an instant, the fire penetrated the roof and spread to the Li Shunji Clothing Store at No. 256 next door. The fire was extinguished after the fire brigades from various districts drove to the scene. A total of three buildings were destroyed, and the fire also spread to one floor of the Wantai Tea Shop at No. 258. Yesterday afternoon, a male corpse was dug out of the rubble. Because the partners of Dachangxiang fled after the fire broke out, it is unknown who the body is. The local guarantor Gu Xueyuan reported to the local court and requested an autopsy. Subsequently, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang was commissioned to lead Inspector Xuan Zhiming to the scene. The autopsy revealed that the corpse's head was burned, and the limbs were incomplete. However, the scrotum was not completely burned, otherwise, it would be impossible to distinguish between male and female. The condition was extremely tragic, and it was determined that he was burned to death. The grid was filled and ordered to be placed in a coffin to await instructions.</p>

<p>The second exhibition of the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association has opened at the Husheshe on Beijing Road recently. The number of visitors is unprecedented in previous calligraphy exhibitions. Famous artists such as Gu Qinglu, Li Qiujun, Feng Wenfeng, and Chen Xiaocui have many masterpieces. The new additions this year include the three sisters of Lingnan Tai Bishuang, Yaoshuang, and Peishuang, as well as Tan Yuese, Chen Shoujin, and Zhang Kunyi, etc. Their works are rich in Lingnan artistic colors, adding a lot of color to the venue. Tang Guanyu, Shou Cuihua, and Xi Xingzhen are disciples of Ma Chao Ran, a master of the art world, and are especially the top students. Huang Quanzheng, Yu Qiusheng, and Yao Xinhua are disciples of the famous writer Li Qiujun, and their works are extraordinary. Li Shu (wife of Li Ping Shu, also known as Fei Longding), a famous artist from Songjiang, Yu Yinchan, and Xi Zonghua Ting are not comparable to those who follow the fashion. Liu Fangqiong (daughter of Minister Wei Lin) put a lot of effort into her work. The new members added this year include Wu Jizhen, Qian Junyao, Lin Mei, Zhu Renyan, Fan Caixia, Zhang Yunyu, Zhou Dazhen, Jiang Zong, Li Shiwen, Yang Tihua, etc. Their works include both calligraphy and painting, each with its own merits. In summary, there are more than 500 works in the entire exhibition. Apart from the old authors who have already become famous, we will not discuss them for the time being. The newly built writers do have the appearance of chasing after the horses, which really adds a lot of luster to the Chinese art scene. It is said that there is only one day left for the exhibition today, and those who love art should not miss the opportunity to visit. Also, yesterday, the number of visitors from all walks of life and artists reached over a thousand, such as Wang Xiaolai, Pan Xulun, Li Zuwei, Li Zushuang, Liang Chenfeng, Wang Yiting, Xi Boyu, Xi Xijiu, Pang Xuqi, Jiang Wanping, Ma Gongyu, etc. All came to visit and praised endlessly, all assisting the exquisite works of this exhibition.

<p>Many managers of roads and alleys in the city are very good at calculating. They build small shops at the entrance of the alleys and rent them to small-capital brokers for business. Tobacco shops are the most common, and there are also many noodle stalls, beef soup stalls, fruit stalls, etc. Recently, the Donation Office of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, in view of the fact that this kind of small shops, which are opened at the entrance of the alleys, although convenient for residents, are quite inconvenient for traffic, has specially ordered them to stop operating in order to facilitate traffic. If they do not comply, they will be enforced. After the small shops at the entrance of each alley stopped operating in accordance with the order, they posted a notice at the door of the shop, saying, "By order of the Public Works Bureau, the opening of the shop in the alley is detrimental to public traffic, so it will stop operating from today. This is hereby announced."</p>

<p>The late famous movie star, Ruan Lingyu, a woman from Zhongshan, Guangdong, fell in love with Zhang Damin, who was from the same hometown, and they got together. After living together, Ruan was introduced into the film industry by Zhang's brother, Zhang Chong, and performed on the screen. Later, due to the breakdown of their love, they separated. Ruan then lived with Tang Jisan, who was also from the same hometown. Recently, Zhang Damin hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Ruan and Tang of adultery, luring, disrupting the family, and forging documents. The court summoned them according to the lawsuit. The first time, the court was ordered to reschedule because the defendants did not arrive. Later, on March 8th, the court reopened the trial. Unexpectedly, Ruan felt stimulated and committed suicide by swallowing a large amount of sleeping pills the day before. The rescue was ineffective, and she died. On the 8th, only the defendant Tang Jisan appeared in court with his defense lawyer Jiang Yiping. Because the plaintiff Zhang Damin did not arrive, it was postponed. The occurrence of this case attracted the attention of movie fans all over Shanghai and caused a sensation. Ruan's suicide was reported in newspapers. Later, someone even rumored that Ruan was not dead and had escaped back to her hometown of Zhongshan County and was arrested. Zhang Damin rushed to hear the news and waited for various rumors. In the end, the case was delayed until now, and the news has been silent for two months. Now it is learned that Zhang's case against Ruan and Tang has been scheduled by Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court to reopen the trial at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month. Summons have been issued and dispatched by the court police to both parties yesterday, and both lawyers have been notified. It is expected that there will be a fierce debate between the two parties at that time.</p>

He was old and weak, and his heart was easily weakened. He was in critical condition and his life was hanging by a thread. He was hospitalized for treatment. After the two doctors carefully diagnosed and treated him, they administered various serums and other emergency treatments, and also transfused blood for him. After a week, he gradually turned from danger to safety, and he was completely healthy after a month.

The report stated that Wang Dingyi was the first defendant, but I am definitely not the first defendant. The claims that Huang Yangzhen approached the family of the first defendant Wang Dingyi and that Wang Dingyi colluded with Zhu Zheyun to frame Chen Pinqing, and that they arranged for Chen Pinqing to be sent to the port, and that the next day they arranged for Chen Pinqing to go to Wusong, etc., are all misunderstandings. Because I and the plaintiff Ms. Chen Pinqing are colleagues, but we do not communicate, so I am writing to request your newspaper to quickly correct the record. Respectfully, Wang Dingyi, May 11th.</p>

<h3 id="e181">CU Wins Both JNU Track and Field Championships - 400m Ties National Record - Dong Shu-Zhao's Triumphant Performance at 51.4 Seconds - Six JNU Records Broken Including 100m <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Group Events to be Piloted Next Year</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th - The JNU track and field meet continued this afternoon at CU. The results of the finals saw six JNU records broken, including the 100m, 800m, high hurdles, low hurdles, shot put, and high jump. Dong Shu-Zhao's 400m tied the national record, greatly enhancing the event. The Central University team is well-equipped with talent and has worked hard to win both track and field championships, which is no accident. The closing ceremony was held at 5:30 PM, with Chairman Rong Qizhao presenting awards. CU President Luo delivered a speech hoping that the spirit and achievements of this meeting would be shared with national and world competitions to promote the spirit of our nation. In the evening, the CU Sports Department hosted a banquet for all referees, which ended at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>400 Meters - Looking at the results of each event, although no new national records were discovered, most of them were excellent. Dong Shu-Zhao, the middle-distance star of Guanghua University, won two first-place finishes and the individual championship. His 400m time of 52.4 seconds equaled the national record set by Liu Changchun at the North China Games in 1929. This achievement has finally been rediscovered after six years. With Dong's talent and hard work, it will not be difficult to tighten it up further and break the record in the future, which is also what we hope for from Dong. His 800m time of 2 minutes and 6 seconds also set a new meet record, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Meet Records - In addition to Dong Shu-Zhao's 400m tying the national record, there were also six new meet records set. Liu Yingjun of Central University at 11.6 seconds was the most outstanding, only 0.4 seconds away from the national record. His long jump of 6.55 meters was also respectable. Huang Feilong of Jinan University, who was unsuccessful in the preliminary selections for the Shanghai International Games, set a new meet record of 11.2 seconds in the sprint, which is rare. He was also satisfied with his 200m at 23.6 seconds.</p>
<p>Total Scores of Each School - The scores of each school in the track and field meet are as follows: "Track" (1) CU 36 points, (2) Guanghua 23 points, (3) Fudan 12 points, (4) Medical South 10 points, (5) Chizhi 5 points, (6) Jinling 1 point; "Field" (1) CU 48 points, (2) Fudan 17 points, (3) Jinan 8 points, (4) Jinling 4 points.</p>
<p>Annual Meeting Held Yesterday - The annual meeting of the JNU Athletic Association was held at the CU gymnasium yesterday morning. Yu Jie of Jinan, Wu Yunrui and Wu Zheng of CU, Shen Kunnan and Wu Shijie of Fudan, Wang Fudan of Chizhi, Xu Shaowu of Jinling, and Peng Wenyu of Guanghua attended. Chaired by Rong Qizhao, the meeting resolved: (1) Regarding the athletic qualifications in the constitution, add the annotation "These ten credits are required for the athlete to graduate" under the original eleven credits. (2) The sports events to be held next semester are basketball, volleyball, and track and field in the fall. (Because the all-around event is related to the National Games, it will be temporarily incorporated into the National Games.) (3) Pilot group events. The 100m and 12-pound shot put will be held next semester, with all first-year university students participating. Please specify the detailed rules, Mr. Wu Zheng. (4) The next semester's tennis championship will be held at Guanghua, and Peng Wenyu will be responsible for planning. The order of assignment of other standing committee members must be notified one month in advance.

In the first game, Mingqiang unexpectedly defeated YINGHWA 21 to 16. In the second and third games, YINGHWA began to overwhelm them. At that time, the wonderful performance of the two teams and the fierce battle were quite spectacular, and the weather was good, which was different from the drizzle yesterday.</p>

<p>Hujiang Defeats YUEH HWA - The Hujiang team has played twice. In the first game, they lost to YINGHWA, and in the second game, they defeated Mingqiang. This time, they defeated YUEH HWA.

<p>YINGHWA Defeats Jinling - YINGHWA joined the competition and has won three consecutive victories. Starting at 10:00 this afternoon, they fought against Jinling on the field. In the hot sunlight, the players were sweating profusely during the battle, and the audience stood and watched in the shade. The referee also wore a large cool hat to avoid the sun. Zheng Yiquan, No. 28 of YINGHWA, is the captain of the team. His performance of smashing was very effective. It is said that he attended the selection of the Chinese team in Shanghai. No wonder his skills are so skilled. As a result, YINGHWA defeated Jinlu 3-0, creating a great record of four wins and four victories. This participation is truly worthwhile.</p>

The students on both sides used intense voices to boost each other's courage. They fought bravely and were able to persevere to the end. The No. 10 player of the YUEH HWA team fainted on the ground due to the heat. At that time, only one ball was left before the end of the game.</p>
<p>Mingqiang 21-17, 12-21, 23-21 YUEH HWA</p>
<p>Hujiang Wins Championship - YINGHWA won the championship repeatedly in the volleyball competition, but it was an exhibition performance and had no right to win the championship. Secondly, Hujiang, although losing to YINGHWA, won victories against other schools. In the last game against Jinlu, Hujiang won again with a score of 3-0, and won the championship. The runner-up will be determined after a meeting because YUEH HWA, Jinling, and Mingqiang each got one point.</p>

<h3 id="e186">China-Portugal Cup - Third Match - Today at 3:30 PM in Shen Garden <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The China-Portugal Cup soccer match adopts a three-game, two-win system. The Chinese team has already won one game and drawn one game. This year's victory already belongs to China. The Chinese team has won for three years in total, and the cup has been won by China. The details have been recorded in previous reports. However, the second game will still be held as usual at 3:30 this afternoon at Shen Garden. The two armies each have their elite lineups. A fierce battle is expected. Referee He Chunhui, the Chinese lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Jiang Shanjing</p>
<p>Gu Shangxiang, Xu Jingcheng, Liang Shutang</p>
<p>Xu Wenkui, Xian Jingyong, Luo Douwen, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Fu Zhibin, Jia Youliang, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<h3 id="e187">International Sports Chinese Supplementary Selection: Wang Jihuai and Others Selected <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Five Supplementary Candidates All Admitted</p>
<p>Because Luo Hu, Wang Jihuai, Zhang Jiakui, Fu Baolu, and Chen Jiayou of the Shanghai Chinese Athletic Games Committee had previously achieved good results, but were unable to participate in the preliminary competition due to certain reasons, a trial competition was specially held yesterday afternoon in Shen Garden. All five of the above-mentioned individuals arrived on time and demonstrated their respective skills. Because there was no competition, the results were mediocre. After discussion by the committee, it was deemed that they were all qualified and were admitted to serve as representatives to this International Games. The results of the five individuals are listed below:</p>
<p>Luo Qian: Discus: 33.59 meters</p>
<p>Zhang Jiakui: Triple Jump: 13.46 meters</p>
<p>Wang Jihuai: Long Jump: 6.39 meters</p>
<p>Fu Baolu: Pole Vault: 3.55 meters</p>
<p>Chen Jiayou: High Hurdles: 18 seconds</p>
<p>Baofu and Wang He Perform Pole Vault Together</p>
<p>Yesterday, only Fu Baolu was scheduled for a formal pole vault demonstration. Temporarily, Wang He, who had achieved excellent results in long jump, triple jump, pole vault, and high jump in the previous day's preliminary competition, accompanied him to enhance the interest. They started jumping from 3 meters, gradually increasing to 3.55 meters. Wang He cleared it on his third attempt, while Baolu cleared it on his fourth attempt. When the height was increased to 3.60 meters, both Wang and Fu were unable to clear it due to fatigue.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiakui's Triple Jump, Wang Jihuai's Jumping Speed</p>
<p>Zhang Jiakui's first triple jump already achieved a result of 12.46 meters. The second jump regressed to 13.29 meters. Ultimately, due to running and jumping alone, without any rest time or competitive interest, he stopped after three jumps. Wang Jihuai was too cautious in the long jump, and his foot did not reach the board when he took off, which significantly affected his performance. He repeatedly stepped in half a foot for more than ten attempts, which was a great pity. His stride was naturally difficult to be accurate. As a result, he recorded a distance of 6.39 meters. Wang He also accompanied him in jumping yesterday, although there was no official record, judging from the distance, it was also not bad.</p>
<p>Chen Jiayou's High Hurdles and Luo Qian's Discus</p>
<p>Chen Jiayou suffered a left leg cramp yesterday. He almost stumbled before the start. His result in the 100-meter dash was mediocre. Later, he gave up the 200-meter dash and ran the 110-meter high hurdles. He started alone, but the result was 18 seconds. His speed and stride at the start were excellent. Unfortunately, he brushed against the fourth hurdle, knocking it down. After this setback, the accuracy of his stride was affected, and he also unfortunately knocked down the ninth hurdle. Otherwise, his result could have improved. Luo Qian's discus result of 33.59 meters was not as good as Weng Gongwan's 33.738 meters in the preliminary competition.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Eighth District Elementary School Joint Sports Meet: Pengpu Wins the Overall Championship <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>More Than 200 Athletes from 13 Participating Schools; Rural Elementary Schools Participating in Joint Sports Meet for the First Time</p>
<p>The Nanshi District Elementary School Joint Sports Meet held its first day yesterday in the Eighth District. The venue was the Jinnan University sports ground. More than 300 athletes from 13 participating schools, in addition to 16 sections of group exercises. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation</p>
<p>Schools in the Zhenru and Pengpu districts have all participated, including Zhangcun, Zhenru, Shiyan, Jinxiang, Pengpu, Yanlong, Guanlong, Xuyuan, Ganlu, Meicun, Pengcheng, Changtou, Gucun, and other 13 schools. Among them, except for Zhenru Elementary School, the other 12 schools have never participated in the city's elementary school joint sports meet. This year, due to district events, travel is convenient, so they can participate enthusiastically. Chief referee Yu Hengzhi was absent; Sun Yiguang substituted in the morning, and Wang Keyong substituted in the afternoon. The East Asia Institute of Physical Education specially dispatched six students to the venue to serve as referees.</p>
<p>Commendable Spirit</p>
<p>Yesterday at 9 a.m., students from various schools had already arrived. The opening ceremony was held first. Chairman Shi Deheng gave a report, followed by a speech by He Jiefu, a representative of the Eleventh District Education Association. The sports meet then began. Although the track and field results were unremarkable, the athletes were all children from rural areas, and their hardworking spirit was particularly commendable. Most of the elementary school students in rural areas could not afford school uniforms, so although the clothing was not uniform during the group exercises, it further demonstrated their spirit of struggle. Yesterday, because the scales were inaccurate, the winning athletes in the male and female B and C groups still needed to be reweighed separately. Prizes were awarded at another time because the time was insufficient.</p>
<p>Minor Dispute</p>
<p>Yesterday, the order at the venue was maintained by the Shiyan Elementary School Boy Scouts, who were quite dedicated. Later, a dispute arose over the rankings of the boys' B group high jump results with the physical education teacher of Shiyan Elementary School. They questioned the referee, and a misunderstanding occurred between the two sides. For a time, all the Boy Scouts abandoned their duties and gathered around the command platform, surrounding it. Unscrupulous individuals also took the opportunity to engage in extra actions. Fortunately, Chen Kemei, the director of Dada Shizhong, stopped them on the spot, preventing a major disaster. However, the school's faculty should be held responsible for this bad phenomenon. Regardless of whether the referee's records were in error, students should not take direct action. Furthermore, these elementary school students should not be allowed to develop the bad habit of not abiding by sportsmanship. The total scores of each school are as follows:</p>
<p>Men's Group Women's Group</p>
<p>(1) Pengpu: 53 points (1) Pengpu: 65 points</p>
<p>(2) Jinxiang: 47 points (2) Zhenru: 33 points</p>
<p>(3) Xiao: 40 points (3) Zhangcun: 30 points</p>
<p>(4) Zhenru: 36 points (4) Shi Xiao: 3 points</p>

<h3 id="e192">Ten Professors Issue a General Response Explaining the Meaning of Chinese-Based Culture <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Recognize That the Need at This Time and Place is to Fight for National Survival; Anti-Imperialism and Anti-Feudalism are Inevitable Missions in the Construction Process; Express Determination to Reject Restoration and Complete Westernization</p>
<p>Since the professors issued the "Declaration of Chinese-Based Cultural Construction," it has had an impact on the whole country in a few months. However, there have been many misunderstandings and doubts. The professors recently issued a general response, which is recorded below. On January 10th of this year, we issued a "Declaration of Chinese-Based Cultural Construction," and at the same time, we held research-oriented symposiums, produced consultation forms, collected important documents, and publicly solicited papers, hoping to obtain a concise and comprehensive guiding principle for cultural construction from these aspects. Now, because the academic community has embraced this idea with great enthusiasm and contributed many valuable opinions, and raised many noteworthy questions, especially regarding: 1. What is Chinese-based? 2. What is not being conservative? 3. What is not blindly following? 4. How is Chinese-based different from "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application"? 5. What are the needs of China at this time and place? 6. What is the attitude towards anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism? We believe it is necessary to respond. In the declaration, we reviewed the reasons for the shaking of Chinese culture after the eastward spread of Westernization by examining the historical development of Chinese culture, pointed out the problems of past failed movements, and advocated that future cultural construction should be based on China, and asserted that the needs of China at this time and place are the foundation of the Chinese-based culture. This clearly indicates that the Chinese-based culture we advocate is not a conservative inheritance, not a blind imitation, not a combination of Chinese essence and Western application, but a creation based on the needs and preparations of the entire nation at this time and place. We firmly believe that different times and places will not have exactly the same needs. The needs of China in the closed-door era and China after the opening of the door are completely different. The world powers in the position of aggressors and China in the position of being invaded also have their different needs. If we admit that each time and place has its own needs, then we should affirm that China at this time and place has its own special needs. The culture produced in response to this special need is of course different from the Chinese culture in the closed-door era or the culture of the world powers. The Chinese-based cultural construction we advocate should be based on this special need. Our belief is such, so the Chinese-based cultural construction we advocate does not promote restoration in the vertical direction, opposes complete Westernization in the horizontal direction, attaches importance to the problems of this time in time, and attaches importance to the environment of this place in space. We earnestly hope that our cultural construction can be consistent with the needs of this time and place.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since culture and the needs of time and place should be consistent, the form of culture should change and progress with the needs of time and place. Attempts to restore the old are not only conservative but simply courting death. If we believe that modern Chinese people should not live in the feudal era, then we should not hold a conservative attitude to prevent the evolution of culture. We must also support the trend of the times and strive to embark on a new and ever-changing future. Only in this way, one of our cultural construction guidelines should be not to be conservative. We adopt a rejection attitude towards any attempt to restore the old. We dare to say that the remnants of feudalism have no realistic value to be obsessed with. Any act of re-enacting history and reviving feudalism will inevitably fail. Even if there is accidental success, it is only a fleeting epiphyllum, a flashing bubble. Instead of creating artificial darkness and prolonging their own evolutionary process, people should go straight to the bright future and accelerate upward development.</p>
<p>For the needs of this time and place, we oppose conservatism. For the needs of this time and place, we also oppose blind adherence. We know that if culture is not combined with the needs of the times, it will lead to historical errors. If culture does not adapt to the conditions of the region, it will also lead to regional conflicts. Modern Chinese people should neither be obsessed with the remnants of the past nor worship idols from foreign lands. If foreign cultures are sufficient to nourish us, we should absorb them as much as possible, but we must make a careful selection based on the needs of this time and place. If we disregard the conditions of time and place and rashly advocate complete Westernization, it is not only turning the guest into the host but truly destroying oneself. Moreover, Western culture itself is not a unified entity. Is not the conflict between capitalist culture and socialist culture a contradiction in Western culture itself? What exactly is meant by "completely accepting"? Is it to completely accept capitalist culture, to completely accept socialist culture, or to completely accept both capitalist and socialist cultures? If it is believed that there is a common foundation or nature between capitalist and socialist cultures that can be completely accepted, it is not known that each culture has its unique system. Since capitalist culture and socialist culture are built on different social relations, any part of their systems cannot be the same. May I ask the proponents of complete Westernization, where do you start Westernizing from? We not only oppose conservatism and blind adherence, but also reject the so-called "Chinese essence, Western application" proposition. Proponents of "Chinese essence, Western application" believe that Western material civilization has its valuable aspects, and Chinese spiritual civilization also has its valuable aspects. If Western material civilization is governed by Chinese spiritual civilization, that would be the most ideal combination. Those who hold this view mostly believe that there is an insurmountable iron limit between material and spirit. Material progress and spiritual progress are completely unrelated. Western material civilization has no soul, and Chinese spiritual civilization has no body. Therefore, it should combine Chinese spiritual civilization with Western material civilization to form a unified whole. But in fact, this is not the case. Material and spirit are two aspects of the same thing and cannot be separated at all. We cannot say that China only has spiritual civilization, nor can we say that the West only has material civilization. When it comes to essence and application, whatever essence there is, there will be application. Whatever application there is, there must be essence. Talking about Chinese essence and Western application simply does not make sense. The Chinese-based cultural construction should be based on the needs of this time and place, needless to say. What exactly are the needs of China at this time and place? First, the people's lives need to be enriched. The lives of the Chinese people are very poor. Not to mention that in terms of material things, it is inferior to others. The lack of knowledge, the disorder of actions, the decline of will, and the dryness of emotions are also symbols of the bankruptcy of the people's lives. Secondly, the people's livelihood needs to be developed. Foreign trade and industrial conditions are the measures of the people's livelihood. China is now a country with trade deficits, backward industries, and a collapsed countryside. How can we not strive for the development of the people's livelihood? Finally, the survival of the nation needs to be guaranteed. Since the Opium War, the forces of imperialism have continued to invade, from cities to villages, densely laying the network of imperialism that binds the freedom of the Chinese nation. The Chinese territory nibbled away and swallowed by whales has only been shrinking day by day. The Chinese sovereignty seized by trickery and force has long been painfully stripped away. In addition to economic exploitation without any end, the blood of the entire Chinese nation is about to dry up. This is also a matter of life and death at the moment. To sum up, the needs of China at this time and place are: "To enrich the lives of the people, develop the livelihood of the nation, and strive for the survival of the nation." Therefore, Chinese-based cultural construction is a manifestation of national self-confidence and a positive creation. Anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism are inevitable missions in this creative process.

<p>By Zhen</p>
<p>Little friends, what holiday is today? I think very few know. You should know that today is Mother's Day.</p>
<p>Where did we come from? We came from our mother's womb. Our mother suffered for more than ten months to bring us into the world. From then on, our mother was even more hardworking, always paying attention to us. She is always thinking about us all day long.</p>
<p>Clothing: When spring arrives, your mother is busy making thin clothes for you. When winter arrives, she is busy making cotton clothes for you again. And you don't think about it at all. Where did your clothes come from? They are all the crystallization of your mother's thousands of stitches. You wear them, but you are still not satisfied, thinking this is too big, that is too small. Should it be like this?</p>
<p>Food: Your mother always chooses good things for you to eat, and also tells you not to eat fatty meat, and that fish is too fishy. What about herself? She eats what you leave behind. What do you think when you see this?</p>
<p>In addition, the bed you sleep on at night is modern, with a spring mattress. In winter, it is a silk cotton quilt and a hot water bottle. In summer, it is a Wenzhou mat and a gauze mosquito net. How deep is your mother's love for you!</p>
<p>Mother loves us so much. How should we repay her? Is it some superficial ceremony? No, definitely not. Our responsibility now is to study hard. That is the only way to repay her.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Story of Han Xin <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>By Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>Marquis Han Xin of Huaiyin was a meritorious official who helped Emperor Gaozu of Han, Liu Bang. Before he became successful, he was an extremely poor and helpless young man. Even now, there are still two historical sites in Huai'an:</p>
<p>(1) Crotch Bridge: In the southwest corner of Huai'an City, there is a place called Crotch Bridge. At that time, Han Xin was still poor and humble. He often went out with a sword hanging from his waist. One day, while passing through the area, many rogue youths said to him: "Han Xin! You often come out with a sword. If you have the ability, show it and compete with us. Otherwise, you can only walk under our crotches!" Han Xin smiled, lowered his head, and walked under their crotches. The rogues all laughed loudly.</p>
<p>(2) Fishing Terrace: When Han Xin was poor, he had no way to make a living, so he fished by the small pond two miles outside the west gate of Huai'an. However, he could not catch any fish every day. Fortunately, there was a washerwoman who often gave him food, allowing him to get through the difficult and difficult times, and achieve great success. Therefore, after Han Xin became a high-ranking official, he once gave a thousand gold to thank the washerwoman, but the washerwoman firmly refused to accept it. To this day, there is still a washerwoman temple and a washerwoman tomb in the vicinity of Huai'an, so that later generations can admire her!</p>

<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Little friends, today is Sunday again. What are you all doing hiding at home today?</p>
<p>Did you get up as early today as you usually do on weekdays? If you got up late, then you should ask yourselves: "What is the healthy way to get up, early or late?"</p>
<p>After breakfast, did you open your schoolbags and review the books you studied during the week? Should you review on Sundays? Or should you not touch books and just have fun, because Sunday is a day of rest?</p>
<p>Younger siblings naturally love to fool around with you, argue with you, and fight with you on Sundays. Classmates will naturally come to tease you to play football, billiards, or invite you out for a walk or hike on Sundays. Neighbor children will naturally come to drag you to play "bandit mountain", act out "The Iron Rooster", or roll copper coins and play cigarette cards on Sundays. Among these kinds of games, which one do you plan to choose today?</p>
<p>This afternoon, if your mother is playing mahjong, then how do you plan to pass the time? If your mother is afraid you will make noise and gives you money, then do you plan to go to the "one copper coin for the top prize" stall at the entrance of the lane to gamble for candy? Or put it in your savings box?</p>
<p>The above questions are all today's questions, and they are all very easy to answer. Little friends, try to answer them.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Mr. Science Performs Magic <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Lifting a cup of water with a string</p>
<p>Mr. Science is back on stage. In his right hand he holds a glass, which is full of water. In his left hand he holds a circular piece of cardboard—slightly larger than the mouth of the glass—and a string. He says to the children on the stage:</p>
<p>"Little friends, we usually get water with a bucket or a basin; today we won't use these two things; we will just use this string and this piece of cardboard to lift this cup of water. Among you, who can do it?"</p>
<p>There was not a single answering voice from the audience, everyone felt that this was impossible to do.</p>
<p>"In fact, as long as you understand a little scientific common sense, this thing is very easy to do. Now, watch me do it."</p>
<p>He first punched a small hole in the center of the cardboard, then threaded the string through the hole: he also took out a candle stub from his pocket, struck a match, lit it, and poured the candle oil on the string, so that it would stick to the cardboard and not fall off.</p>
<p>After doing this, he covered the mouth of the glass with the cardboard, using his fingers to tighten the surroundings so that there was no gap for air to get in. At this time, you see him slowly straighten the string, slowly lift it up, haha! This cup full of water, which is quite heavy, is suspended in the air, very firm, very stable, and not a single drop of water spills out.</p>
<p>So the children in the audience were all stunned in surprise.</p>
<p>"Little friends, do you know why this cup doesn't fall down? It turns out that there is a lot of air pressure on our top, bottom, left, right, front, and back. This air pressure is called atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>"Now this cup is full of water, there is no air inside, and the cardboard is tightly covering the top, so that the air outside the cup cannot get in. Therefore, only the air above the cardboard is pressing down, so that the cardboard is firmly attached to the mouth of the cup and cannot fall off; at the same time, the air below the cup is also pressing upwards, holding the cup up. In this way, the cup is suspended in the air by the string and will not fall down.</p>
<p>"Now turn the cup upside down, will this cardboard fall off?—No, you see, for the same reason, it will not fall off either."</p>
<h3 id="e201">You Can Seek Fish by Climbing a Tree <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>Little friends! You must be surprised when you see this title. "Seeking fish by climbing a tree" is an idiom, a metaphor for something impossible to obtain. Because fish are in the water, how can you get them by climbing a tree? But I want to tell you: "You can seek fish by climbing a tree."</p>
<p>There is a kind of fish called the "climbing perch", which is produced in the fresh water of India, Malaysia, and other places. Its fins are particularly hard. When it lives in the water day and night and feels a little unhappy, it wants to go to the shore to play. When it comes from the water to the shore, it uses the spines of its pelvic and abdominal fins to support itself on the ground, and uses its pectoral fins to crawl, just like a beast walking on its feet. Although it doesn't walk as lightly as a beast, it can walk up from the beach, step by step, climb the reeds on the shore, and walk all the way to the reeds on the shore. In the water, it breathes with gills like other fish, but when it reaches the shore, it also has a substitute for gills that can breathe air and does not feel difficult; this is also one of the reasons why it can safely go ashore.</p>
<p>According to general speculation, its hard fins can be used as feet to walk and climb reeds, and if there are big trees by the river, it would certainly be possible for it to climb the big trees. Perhaps it is because there are no big trees by the river, but no one has ever seen it climb a big tree. Otherwise, the idiom "seeking fish by climbing a tree" would become a real saying.</p>

<p>— Yan Xinquan</p>
<p>Little friends! Now I will tell you an interesting arithmetic problem. When you are free, you may as well ask your brothers, sisters, or friends to see if they can figure it out.</p>
<p>"A basket of turtles and a load of ducks, there are only forty-nine heads, and there are one hundred feet, how many turtles and how many ducks?"</p>
<p>But you have to explain to him: turtles have four feet and ducks only have two feet! After saying this, wait for him to calculate; if he really can't figure it out, then tell him the answer.</p>
<p>Answer: One turtle, forty-eight ducks.</p>

<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>The lion has been known as the king of beasts since ancient times. Its shape is similar to that of a long-haired lion dog. The structure of its body is best suited for preying on other beasts. Its teeth have three kinds: incisors, canines, and molars. The canines and molars are very sharp. No matter what goes into its mouth, it will bite it into pieces. Its feet are the same as those of a cat, and its sense of touch is very sensitive. The shapes of male and female lions are very different. Male lions have silkworm hair and a majestic appearance. The hair is yellow-brown and produced in the sand dunes of East Africa and Southwest Asia, so the color of its hair is similar to the color of the sand dunes. Generally speaking, animals have a kind of protective coloration. The tiger and leopard have yellow ground and black patterns, which are similar to the grass leaves of the forest. The white fox and white bear are pure white, which is similar to the color of the snowy ice field. This is the natural advantage given to them to defend against enemies and obtain food. When lion cubs are first born, they are the same as cats and dogs. They will open their eyes after three days, and their bodies will have black spots. There are black stripes on their backs, which look like tigers and leopards. After growing up, the black stripes and spots gradually disappear. After being born, the lion cubs eat milk for two months, and then they will eat meat. After half a year, they will follow the mother lion to hunt beasts outside. The method of attacking other beasts is often to jump fiercely onto the beast's body and bite its neck to kill it. After eating, it must drink water. Every morning and evening, it drinks a large amount of water once. If it cannot eat all of the beast it has bitten to death at one time, it will carry it to a suitable place and cover the remains with wood leaves and dead grass to prevent them from being seen by other beasts, so that it can come and eat them next time. It hides in its lair during the day, and when the sun sets, it comes out to move around. Its bark is very loud, and all the beasts tremble when they hear its voice. It often accompanies a group of five or six lions and climbs onto the rocks in the sand dunes to roar loudly. When it roars, the earth shakes and the heavens move, and when the beasts hear its roar, they think that the lion is coming to harm them, and they all run east and west to escape. If we encounter a lion on the road, don't worry, because the lion will not bite us casually. If it is walking around looking east and west, then it must be going to the place of its companions. But when it is hungry, or when it is a female lion following lion cubs, then there is a danger to life. In Uganda, East Africa, when the railway was being built, the workers were often harmed by lions. A Colonel Paitaisong brought three thousand workers from India to live along the route by setting up tents. Unexpectedly, there were two lions nearby who smelled the scent of humans and came to the tents every night to harm people, so many workers were harmed by them. Although they tried all kinds of methods to capture it, the two lions were very bold. Every day when the sun went down, they would roar loudly, and in an instant they would run to the side of the tent, trying to eat people. The workers could not sleep peacefully every night, and took turns guarding outside the tents. Later, after they were killed one by one with machine guns, they were able to be safe and sound.</p>

<p>— Zhang Youjian</p>
<p>(1) After the cook kicked Fei'er into the sea, he quickly released a lifeboat to rescue Fei'er.</p>
<p>(2) While walking on the road, Fei'er and Rong'er both felt hungry. They saw a pot of hot wheat flour cakes placed on the window of a house, so the two of them took it and ate it.</p>
<p>(3) They were seen by the owner, and the two of them desperately ran away.</p>
<p>(4) Fei'er ate too much, and after running for a while, his stomach suddenly hurt, and he couldn't run anymore. Someone was chasing after them, and the two of them were very anxious.</p>
<p>(5) Rong'er suddenly saw a donkey eating grass, so he helped Fei'er to ride on it first, and then he rode on it himself.</p>
<p>(6) Unexpectedly, the donkey got angry when it saw strangers, kicked Fei'er down, and then came to bite Rong'er.</p>
<p>(7) The two of them fell so hard that their muscles and bones were sore, and they couldn't get up from the ground.</p>
<p>(8) Just then, an ambulance passed by and quickly carried the two of them into the car. At this time, Fei'er laughed and said to Rong'er: "Looking at it this way, it's thanks to this donkey; otherwise, how could we have returned home so quickly?"</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>I rested for a while, then got up to take a walk and see the place. I saw that all around were ripe fruits, and clear and clean streams flowed down the slopes, so I got food and drink. When night came, I lay down, but I couldn't sleep because I was afraid, and after dawn, I was very happy.</p>
<p>So I went out for a walk, but I didn't go far before I saw an old man on the bank of the stream. At first, I thought he was from a shipwreck, and he seemed weak and sick. I spoke to him, but he didn't answer me. He gestured to me to carry him on my back and walk across the stream together.</p>
<p>I thought he needed my help, so I helped him. When we reached the other side of the stream, I bent down so that he could get off easily.</p>
<p>However, this old man, whom I thought was very weak, did not get off my back. He raised his legs and wrapped them around my neck, and squeezed my throat so tightly that I thought I was going to suffocate. Finally, I fell down and fainted, but the old man was still holding on to me. When I regained my breath, he kicked me to make me stand up.</p>
<p>I reluctantly carried him closer to the trees, and he kept telling me to stop and find fruit to eat. He never left me all day, and when I lay down to sleep at night, he still clung to my neck. This went on day after day, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get rid of this old man.</p>
<p>Everyone, try to imagine what it felt like for me to carry this strange old man every day; no matter how I tried, I couldn't get rid of him.</p>
<p>One day I found a large gourd, and I made some wine in it with grape juice. This wine was very good, it made my heart happy, and I sang a song all the way.</p>
<p>The old man saw me drinking the wine and saw how good the wine made me feel, so he gestured for me to give him some. After I gave it to him to drink, it made his head feel light, and he began to sing, shaking up and down even though he was still clinging to my neck.</p>
<p>Before long, his legs came off my neck, so I threw him violently to the ground and killed him by hitting him on the head with a large stone.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Finance: Conflicting News, Huge Fluctuations in Bid Premium <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>——Result: Continued Decline of Four and a Half Yuan——</p>
<p>The gold market initially rose yesterday due to favorable news from the Jiangnan Zhengbao newspaper, as well as arbitrage by the Guangdong gang of British American Tobacco Company and others. In the end, it only fell due to the news from foreign telegrams of an increase in silver prices, which stimulated selling pressure. People's hearts continued to be uncertain. The half-day market situation avoided sharp fluctuations. The exhibition initially showed that overseas silver markets rose uniformly, and the short-term market was reported to be strong after the closing of the large exchange. There were reports of transactions above the listed price of 125. The forward silver price in Montgomery also increased. The exchange rate rose sharply, and each Customs Gold Unit fell by three-tenths of a cent. People's hearts were tired. Pre-market trading opened outside the market, retreating to 88-89 yuan. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, both the British and American currencies rose, the Customs Gold Unit fell by 0.13 cents, and the standard bid premium price fell to 83.51 yuan, dropping to 85.6 yuan, and then rose slightly. However, the morning opened low, and after opening, the Guangdong gang's arbitrage of shillings boosted people's hearts, and gradually broke through 90 yuan. British American Tobacco Company also arbitraged shillings, and the exchange market tightened. Buyers gathered, and the Jiangnan Zhengbao newspaper reported that our side would reduce the cash reserve of banknotes from 60% to 40%, causing sellers to stand by and watch. The chips were originally exhausted. After this, the situation was strong. However, because the banks' appetites were clogged, there were also those who sold at high prices, and the rising trend was blocked and fell slightly. At this time, the exchange market was stable, and the transactions in the market gradually became light. The market situation was calm for quite a long time. Unexpectedly, the foreign telegrams were all transferred, and the US government still intended to raise the silver price to $1.29, reduce the silver import tax, and abolish the profit tax. The 90-yuan mark was broken, and sellers were active, and the decline was particularly strong. Afterwards, although the exchange market was loose but ordinary, and although the noon market also fell but had more volume, the half-day market was firm and then tired, and the future was still uncertain. Now the half-day market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 787.5 yuan, down 2.5 yuan from the previous close. Fuxing Yonghui Xiang sold to 6.5 yuan, Dasui Cheng Hengyu Yiyu Fuju Yong then advanced and still rose.

Yongli Tongyu Run sold, retreating to 0.2 yuan. Dadecheng, Fuxing Yong Hengyu also advanced to 3.3 yuan.

Dafayong Qianchang Xiang Huixiang Hengyu Yifeng Yong Yuanchang Yong Jiarun Yong Feng Chunyuan Yong Dadecheng Changda Yuansheng Yong and others sold successively, falling to 85.5 yuan.

Fuxing Yong Hengyu Chunyuan Yong Fu Futai Ting Dadecheng still sold, and fell again to 5 yuan. Yuamao Yong Fuxing Yong Na bought, rising to 7 yuan. Changda Hengyu sold, retreating to 5.2 yuan. The noon close was 785.5 yuan. The highest price during the half-day was 795.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 785 yuan, a fluctuation of 10.05 yuan. The result was a further drop of 4.5 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was listed at the Central Bank's standard bid premium price, falling to 83.71 yuan, which, according to the closing price, was about 5 yuan weaker, and 11 yuan less than the previous close. The registration for this month was 788 yuan, for June 786 yuan, the morning replenishment was 788 yuan, and the price of red gold was about 10 yuan, at 797.5 yuan. The spot market situation was stable, and there were not many transactions. Tianjin goods added about 13.5 yuan, and there was a lack of supply. Swaps also lacked transactions. There were 224 remaining May orders, with the majority being Qianchang Xiang over 100, and Hengyu Yuanchang Yong Dacheng Hengchang Yong being in the minority.

HSBC Bank's listed prices were announced, the British pound rose by 0.125 and the US dollar rose by 0.25. Although there was a fluctuation, the process was still tight. Banks took the opportunity to sell high, and then turned to fluctuating. Finally, foreign telegrams reported that the US government still intended to raise the silver price to $1.29 and reduce the silver profit tax, and people's hearts were tired. Banks like Guohua Agricultural Industry and others sold successively, and some Chinese merchants also supplied for settlement. The process gradually loosened, but the strength was average.

<p>Yesterday was the weekend, with the usual afternoon holiday, and also the final day of the spring races, causing several foreign banks to completely cease accepting payments. Consequently, the financial market situation felt even more sluggish. There is no hope for a turnaround until relief lending is implemented. The call loan rate in the market remains virtually unchanged, at 1.2% in both the morning and afternoon sessions, with no additional interest. In call money transactions, over 3.2 million was transferred in the morning session, with over 300,000 in new transactions.

<h3 id="e211">Securities Market Drifts Within a Narrow Range <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw market conditions circling yesterday, becoming increasingly stagnant, with dwindling transactions, and most observers adopting a wait-and-see approach. The discouraging news was tiresome. While winter conditions have uncertainties, this brewing situation has been ongoing for a long time, so let's see how it changes. Throughout the day, trading mainly involved entering and exiting within a 5-fen range. Bond No. 4 appeared to have some selling pressure, but sellers were holding prices firm and unwilling to dump. There was little buying or selling on the trading floor. Even the 96 Public Bonds showed little fluctuation. The various trading groups showed no interest and watched to see what would happen. As a result, daily price fluctuations were limited to 5 fen or 1 jiao. The total transaction volume amounted to 3,105,000 yuan. The following table lists the resulting price changes (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from Xin Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 10th), New York stock market continued to rise, led by oil and utility stocks. Many stocks achieved new year-to-date records. The price increases were mostly in investment-grade stocks rather than speculative ones. On the smaller exchange, utility and oil stocks were also very active. In the bond market, some corporate bonds were quite firm, while U.S. government bonds were cleared. The total volume traded for the day was 1.58 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>May 9th	May 10th	Change</p>
<p>30 Industrials	120.10	113.67	Up 0.57</p>

<h3 id="e213">Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Turn Sluggish, and Marked Yarn Weakens Again <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>After rising for two consecutive days, the yarn market is now showing weakness again, mainly due to the sluggish sales of actual yarn. Furthermore, most people are bearish, due to news that someone still has deliveries to make in the near future, which makes people feel uneasy. However, the bullish side appears quite strong. According to market sources, a certain firm has an amount of 6,000 to 7,000 bales and is said to be receiving goods this month.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Retreats</p>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market showed rising trends for all months, because multiple parties were purchasing last trading day, causing the trading floor to be tight. However, after two or three rounds of auctions, it turned weak again, and the market price fell back. Most people are bearish and expect cotton yarn to fall. As a result, each month's price rose slightly by 2 or 3 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening showed a sudden decline, and the situation was sluggish. It is said that actual yarn sales were quiet. The total volume traded for the day was only over 400 bales. Another source said that someone was competitively selling in the interior, causing the trading floor to suddenly become loose. As a result, each month's price fell by 4, 5, 6, or 7 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuda sold 650 bales, Tongji 600 bales, Shenji 1,600 bales, Run Kang 800 bales, Deji 450 bales, He Xing 500 bales, and Ren Feng 450 bales. Da Feng bought 850 bales, Yuan Da 850 bales, Mingde 700 bales, He Xing 300 bales, and Yi Chang 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Change	Inventory</p>
<p>May	174.2	173.6	173.6	Down 0.30	32,450</p>
<p>June	176.4	175.4	175.4	Down 0.70	35,950</p>

<h3 id="e214">Marked Cotton Reverses and Falls Back <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>After rising sharply for three days, the cotton market is gradually showing signs of falling back, due to the poor yarn market and the Shanghai cotton inventory still being around 800,000 dan. Furthermore, it has already risen by 1.6 or 1.7 yuan from the low price, and some people believe that it can stabilize. However, the bullish side is still not selling. Buying interest in new cotton for October is still strong. Japanese merchants are selling July and August and buying October to hedge.</p>
<p>Zheng Marked Cotton Loosens</p>
<p>The opening of the marked cotton market showed a firm trend for all months. However, the upward momentum could not advance, because U.S. cotton failed to continue rising. However, the rising trend of Indian cotton became more intense. However, marked gold prices fell, and yarn sales were sluggish. The actual cotton business was dull. Some people were bearish, but the major bulls held on tightly. He Xing bought heavily, 8,000 dan. As a result, each month's price remained unchanged compared to the previous day's closing price. New cotton for October rose by 0.15 yuan, because cotton merchants were buying very firmly. In addition to Mei An Foreign Firm selling 20,000 dan alone, the afternoon opening showed the market softening again. It was heard that the Lingbao cotton inventory increased by 4,830 pieces. Profit-taking caused the market to tend downward. As a result, each month's price fell by 5 fen to 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. Da Fu sold 4,200 dan, Tong Xing 4,400 dan, Sheng Yuan 1,900 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 3,000 dan, Rui Yuan 1,200 dan, Shen Chang 1,300 dan, Sen Kang 1,300 dan, Chang Feng 800 dan, and Chang He 900 dan. He Xing bought 9,300 dan, Jun Chang 1,000 dan, Shen Ji 2,800 dan, Ren Feng 1,400 dan, Run Kang 2,300 dan, Yi Chang 2,100 dan, and Da Fu 1,600 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, when the U.S. cotton market opened, due to profit-taking and foreign firm selling, all months fell by 2 to 4 pounds per point. There was spread selling in July contracts. And as the new and old harvests are similar, old cotton was transfered to new cotton. Afterwards, the market recovered due to short covering, buying by brokers, expectations of government purchases of spot cotton after selling off its stock, and a robust stock market. Government agents bought and market conditions were improving. Unofficial estimates indicate that the government sold 130,000 bales of government owned cotton. However, the amount of cotton the government purchased for future delivery was not close to this amount. Heth Estimates that mill use would be about 18,000 bales this week. Liverpool cotton reserves were 267,000 bales. The market close was firm. But, the market is currently wavering between the possibility of inflation and breaching the 1.2-jiao level, as a price of 1.2 jiao may trigger selling from stock holders and cotton syndicates. There is some talk of storage costs for the new cotton, but this will depend on the government's lending policy. Spot prices remain unchanged, futures prices up 3-10 points. English cotton spot prices were up 6 points, and futures were up 6-7 points. Indian cotton opened up firm with short covering and European export buying but retreated on profit taking. Pingle was up 1.25-2.125 rupees, Ormla was up 0.75-2.5 rupees, and White Luo Creek was up 2-4.25 rupees. Original telegraph as follows (10th dispatch):</p>

<h3 id="e217">Grains: Northern Merchants Compete for Near-Term Flour <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the near-term months initially showed flat prices, followed by a sharp rise. With foreign wheat prices, Chicago had fallen back by about 3-4 jiao, and Canada improved by 1 jiao. When the market opened, the conflicting price trends in foreign wheat caused people to believe that prices would remain flat. However, after the second round of trading, prices gradually increased. Because the Northern merchants feared drought, those who manage grain were furiously buying. With new wheat about to come on the market in Jiangnan, foreign wheat prices were still cheap, and people acted nervously, exaggerating the situation. By the afternoon opening, the near-term market was still soaring, partly due to market sentiment, and partly due to the fact that flour inventories in various factories were truly depleted, so prices were repeatedly raised, even reaching 5 jiao 5.5 fen. Adding 5 fen to the standard price would bring it to the major level of 6 jiao. The seriousness of the situation should not be underestimated. The prices for June, July and August also rose sharply. The prices for September and October were relatively stable, as there were reports that factories continued to order a boatload of Australian wheat at a price of only 4 yuan 7 jiao 1 fen. Therefore, although buying was brisk, the price increase was less. As a result, the price for this month rose by 5 fen 2.5 li, the price for June rose by 3 fen 7 li, the price for July rose by 4 fen 2.5 li, the price for August rose by 3 fen 5 li, the price for September rose by 1 fen 2.5 li, and the price for October rose by 1 fen 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Customers Actively Buy Future Wheat at Higher Prices <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the future wheat market showed flat prices in the morning, followed by a sharp rise in the afternoon. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago fell by about 3-4 jiao, and Canada improved by 1 jiao. After the market opened, the prices for various months were lower by 1-2 fen, because foreign wheat prices had decreased. By the close, the price trend of the flour market had greatly risen, which also led to higher prices. By the afternoon opening, due to concerns about the new wheat crop in the North being affected by drought, customers from other ports gradually increased their buying activity, so the market rose steadily. Based on this situation, it seems that the market should be rising, but the flow of foreign wheat continues, so an excessive price increase would be inappropriate. As a result, the prices for July and August each rose by 9 fen, and the price for September rose by 8 fen. The actual wheat market price is still stable, with Shandong wheat at 4 yuan 1 jiao, Henan wheat at 4 yuan, Haizhou wheat at 4 yuan 7 fen, and Jiangbei wheat at 3 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen. 4,000 bags of new wheat were shipped.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: According to Canadian government estimates, the Canadian harvest will be about 22.8 million bushels. Today, because the weather report was very good, the market bears softened slightly. Spot wheat and factory wheat also loosened. The U.S. government estimates that the U.S. winter wheat production will be 43.1 million bushels, slightly less than expected.</p>

<p>South Market Closed Today - Many Foreign Rice Shipments, Also Smaller</p>
<p>Local rice (Shanghai South) yesterday, the source of goods from various groups was similar to before, with a total of more than 30 firms arriving (a total of more than 6,000 shi). However, sales were sluggish, the situation was bleak, and the market was difficult to recover. The prices of various goods continued to decline. For example, Su Tong, Nan Gang and other japonica rice continued to depreciate by 0.2-0.3 yuan, while Qing Jiao and other late rice varieties were only purchased by the Qingdao group for over 300 bags, falling by more than 3 chi. Prices for other varieties such as Yin Bian Yuan also fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan. Today is the opening ceremony of the South Rice Merchants Association in the South Market, and all businesses are closed for the day.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 15-16 ships arrived from various routes in He Xia. The sales volume of various goods in the market was still weak, and the market price of white japonica rice also fell by about 0.1 yuan. Early thin rice prices fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan, white yuan also fell by a small amount, and other goods also appeared weak.</p>
<p>Foreign rice: Yesterday, the foreign rice market was characterized by a continuous stream of arriving ships and many orders still on the way. Traders, seeing that local inventory was sufficient and inland sales had decreased, were nervous and sold off cheaply, while importers, seeing that the market was weak, were hesitant to sell and waited for the market to improve before trading. Some customers, whose previous orders had not yet been fully loaded, were currently paying for existing inventory and temporarily stopped buying. Therefore, total spot sales of foreign rice for the day were less than 5,000 bags, and prices continued to fall by several fen to 0.1 yuan. Due to the large amount of arriving goods, the price of No. 3 rice from yesterday's Lu route fell to 8.9 yuan, which was about 0.15 yuan lower than the previous day. Yesterday, over 600 bags of ke xian rice were sold at a discount, and the price also decreased by a few fen. Among them, the Sichuan rice, which arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, was of excellent quality, similar to the high-quality rice from Jiangnan. The owner originally intended to store it and wait for a good price, and had previously offered several hundred bags at 10.04 yuan. However, due to the hot weather and the falling prices of foreign rice, they sold it along with the market, but because the goods were of higher quality, the sales were not sustained, and the price was able to stabilize, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e220">New Broad Beans from Wenzhou on the Market <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>—New Goods Already Opening in Wuhu—</p>
<p>This year, the spring harvest season is favorable due to the sunny weather, and new goods are appearing on the market very early (last year it was at the end of the sixth lunar month). Yesterday, 300 bags of new broad beans from Wenzhou were on the market. The product is a small-grained variety, with only 70% dryness, and the price is 4 yuan. However, the merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach, so there is no rush to raise prices for the new goods. Because the bean quality is too soft, the East Asian group is not buying, and the Tianjin group has no space for transportation and loading, so no transactions have been made. The new rapeseed was launched the day before yesterday for 10,000 bags from Wuhu, for delivery in June-July, calculated according to the standard regulations of 3 jin bags, not accounting for the merchant's scale. The price is between 3 liang 8 qian and 8 qian. Currently, the weather is good, and the harvest year appears to be plentiful, so the market sentiment is bearish.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than 2,000 boxes of red tea from Qimen, Ningzhou, and Zhide were continuously shipped from the Yangtze River and Hangzhou routes. More than 800 packages of green tea from Huzhou and Ningbo were also shipped to Shanghai. Both red and green tea arrivals are very abundant, but the market transactions are still weak. Zhen Mei green tea from Sui'an has been launched by Tong Fu Foreign Firm for 120 yuan.

<h3 id="e222">Mother's Day Reflections <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Shun</p>
<p>Today—May 12th—is Mother's Day! What a deeply moving festival this is! A mother's love is above all else! Ms. Ellen Key said: "Mothers who nurture their children are as sacred as the sun!" There is also a Chinese saying, "Even at a hundred years old, a mother still loves her eighty-year-old child!" These all express the supreme greatness of maternal love! Motherly love is not only the source of individual life but also the simplest and most fundamental requirement for human survival! While commemorating Labor Day and National Humiliation Day certainly has social significance, commemorating the great Mother's Day has even greater social and human significance!</p>
<p>However, how should we commemorate it? The Shanghai Chinese Women's Temperance Union has first proposed the following commemoration methods for us.</p>
<p>(1) Those without mothers come on stage to present flowers.</p>
<p>(2) Those far away send letters of greetings; if far away, write articles praising mothers, or donate to charitable organizations to do charitable works that mothers would most like.</p>
<p>(3) Those who disobey their mother's teachings should resolve to correct their mistakes.</p>
<p>(4) Those in this port (Shanghai) use gifts, tours, banquets, etc., to make their mothers happy.</p>
<p>However, these methods, apart from a few people with comfortable lives, are of course impossible for most poor mothers and children to implement. They have no extra money to buy flowers or donate, nor the ability to write articles praising their mothers' virtues, let alone the leisure to accompany their mothers on outings! It seems that the gentlemen of the Women's Temperance Union have not taken into account the vast majority of starving and freezing mothers and children!</p>
<p>We know that there is no mother who does not love her own children, and similarly, there is no child who does not want to be filial to their mother! But what is the reason why there are unfilial children and evil mothers in the world? It is not that they are inherently evil and unfilial, but that society forces them to do evil! Recently, it was reported in various newspapers that in a certain village in Lihuang County, a son ate his mother's corpse due to starvation! This is certainly an extreme example, but generally speaking, in many disaster areas, parents exchanging children to eat is common, and selling children is even more common! Even from today's issue (see "A Note on Japanese Women's Movement"), we can see the huge number of mothers leading their children to commit suicide! And due to financial relationships, parents and children treating each other as enemies is a very common and ordinary phenomenon! Given the above situation, what right do we have to ask them to be filial and loving to each other!</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if the Temperance Union's commemoration methods can be done, it is still a personal matter and has no social significance! Why? Because each individual commemorates their own mother, and the mother being commemorated may receive temporary comfort, but her suffering as a mother, especially the suffering of motherhood being suppressed under the patriarchal system, still cannot be alleviated. What is the significance of such commemoration? Therefore, if we want to commemorate Mother's Day, we must commemorate it in a social sense! That is, we should commemorate it by relieving the suffering of all mothers and, even more so, by enabling the majority of mothers to obtain lasting happiness!</p>
<p>From this perspective, Mother's Day is closely related to the liberation of our women, especially the issue of maternal protection! Therefore, today we must at least advocate to society: all mothers should have interests and rights in the family, society, and even politically and economically. Only in this way can it be a truly filial Mother's Day commemoration!</p>
<h3 id="e223">A Note on Japanese Women's Movement <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>—Promoting the Implementation of the Mother and Child Assistance Act—</p>
<p>The capital of Japan, Tokyo, is like any major city in the world, bustling and prosperous, of course. On the other hand, in this bustling and prosperous place, there are countless people who cut off their own lives, according to the Daily News. But what attracts our attention the most is the large number of "mother-child suicide" incidents where people cut off their own lives because they have no way to make a living.</p>
<p>This fact is most evident in recent years. In 1933, there were thirty-five cases of parent-child suicide, and in 1932, there were thirty-four cases. Among them, fathers led their children in only four cases, while in the remaining thirty-one cases, mothers committed suicide along with their children.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Central Social Work Association—this is based solely on the articles in the four major newspapers, Tokyo Nichinichi, Osaka Mainichi, Tokyo Asahi, and Osaka Asahi—in the four years from 1929 to 1933, there were a total of 1,008 cases of parent-child suicide. The number of people involved was 2,789, including more than 1,615 children. According to the gender of the "parent" in this statistic, there were 364 fathers and 774 mothers. In fact, the number of mothers was more than double the number of fathers.</p>
<p>Among the reasons, financial difficulties accounted for 324, family discord 116, personal illness 90, mental abnormality 109, unemployment 54, and child illness 21. All of these reasons can be said to stem from economic problems.</p>
<p>It is said that the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, from the standpoint of child protection, investigated fatherless poor widows in 1925 and attempted to formulate an assistance act. However, this assistance act has not yet been implemented, and the relief law enacted in 1929 is still in a perfunctory state.</p>
<p>Originally, this relief law was implemented starting in April 1930. Although the Social Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs claimed at the time that the total number of people to be rescued would be 150,000 and the total cost would be 8 million yen, in reality, the number of people rescued in 1933 was only:</p>
<p>Children 51,964 people</p>
<p>Pregnant women 130 people</p>
<p>Mothers breastfeeding infants 556 people</p>
<p>Total 52,650 people</p>
<p>Moreover, the amount of this relief was only 20 sen per person per day, although it was later increased to 25 sen, but each household could not exceed one yen per day. How many mothers and children can this relief law actually save? Judging from many examples, not only is it ultimately difficult for people to live on this relief money, but there are also countless cumbersome procedures for receiving the money and people are often unaware of their right to receive it. In addition, there is a sense of contempt on both the giving and receiving sides, so it is difficult to say that this relief has a sufficient effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, recently, women's groups across Japan have organized a League for the Promotion of the Implementation of the Mother and Child Assistance Act, and have made this matter the mainstream of today's women's movement and are petitioning the parliament.</p>
<p>Their argument is that the era when wives were seen as tools for producing family heirs has passed. All children belong to the nation and society, and the nation and society should have the responsibility to protect their lives, and the lives of the mothers who nurture these children should of course be guaranteed.</p>
<p>They also argue that the so-called Mother and Child Assistance Act is different from the relief law. It is the natural responsibility of society to children and to the mothers who raise them. Therefore, the country should enact a corresponding Mother and Child Protection Act in its laws to rescue many mothers and children from malnutrition and the insecurity of death.</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>It is reported that Xu Ming'e, a female student at Zhenguang Middle School in Yantai, was shot and killed after being teased by accompanying policemen while visiting Nanshan to admire pear blossoms. Afterwards, the local student union issued an official statement, saying:</p>
<p>"The entire Zhenguang Girls' Middle School went to Nanshan to admire pear blossoms... Xu Ming'e and seven others wandered to the eastern slope of the mountain stream... Unexpectedly, three security policemen who had been following them for about an hour suddenly approached them and indulged in teasing and playing. One of them, the murderer Kong Fanshu, even took out the box gun he was carrying and aimed it at Xu Ming'e and the others, saying 'Taking a photo.' While hesitating, although the two policemen beside him tried to stop him, Kong declared 'Who are we afraid of now?' As soon as he said this, Xu Ming'e fell to the ground... The investigation found that the occurrence of this tragedy was due to Kong's shallow knowledge, arrogant arrogance, and treating human life as a child's play; and the reason why he acted this way was due to the negligence of duty of the local administrative officials who ruled them..."</p>
<p>Students are still students, with righteousness, enthusiasm, and a sense of right and wrong. From the May Fourth Movement to now, it is the "adults" who have aged, but the students still have their innocent hearts. Originally, killing a few people, shedding some blood, and staining a few flowers red is a really trivial matter. Moreover, the deceased was a woman, and Kong and the policemen had pursued her with bloodshot eyes for an hour, which was already their fault; if it weren't for these students, this matter would have passed without a trace like raindrops. With a badge on his chest and a box gun in his hand, "Who are we afraid of now?" Kong the policeman's bold words are enough to make everyone admire him. When Emperor Shengdu went to Japan, he could have been his attendant and would certainly not have disgraced the country.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Random Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yan</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was news of a Western policeman killing Zhao Liujia, a vegetable vendor. It attracted the attention of people in society, and several groups rose up to support her, demanding punishment of the murderer and compensation for the family. However, there has been no further news since then. Has "punishment of the murderer and compensation" achieved its purpose? One cannot help but wonder!</p>
<p>While a bloody and tragic murder picture is still lingering in our minds, the following record has jumped into my eyes in the newspapers in recent days: "A Dutch member of the Isokuma Circus troupe from England (the police have not announced his name) lured a thirteen-year-old girl who was passing by the circus entrance to come in and watch the show on April 30th. By the afternoon of the third day, a Chinese laborer named Wang Genben helped him rape her. Afterwards, Shan Wang Genben lured her to the Great World for entertainment, where she was spotted by a colleague of her maternal uncle, Zhang Haoyue, who was able to chase and capture them and hand them over to the police. The girl immediately confessed that she, Ge Yin Abe, was the adopted daughter of Yin Shengtao, a current screenwriter and actor at the Tianchan Dance Hall. She then recounted the details of the incident. At the time, the police took the victim to identify the Westerner who raped her and search for evidence, which was quite strict, and instructed Yin Shengtang to go to the police station again the next morning to file a lawsuit with the Dutch consulate and the Second Special District Court. Who knew that when Yin Shengtao went to the police station at three o'clock, the police suddenly changed their attitude and announced in the afternoon that they would not accept the case and would release the witness Wang Genmu. Yin Xintao, feeling that there was no way to seek redress, sent letters to the United Federation of Actors and the Yangzhou Association in Shanghai for assistance." Originally, the law stipulates imprisonment for raping a thirteen-year-old girl, but the consular jurisdiction of imperialists still holds sway in China, and Chinese law is like a Chinese hero who cannot use his martial arts in the concession! Those who suffer the most here are, of course, ordinary people, especially weak women. Chinese women, like Chinese men, are subjected to the political and economic oppression of the imperialists, and also to an additional layer of sexual humiliation. Alas! Imperialism and Chinese women!</p>
<p>Women's groups in Shanghai are numerous, and they should be more courageous than any other group in rising up to support this girl who has been brutally humiliated. This is the proper duty of fighting for national glory.</p>
<h3 id="e226">A Visit to the First Nursery in Beijing <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>The sun was setting, it was the time for school to let out, and I walked along the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dingjiaqiao, past the Central Party Headquarters and Xuanwu Lake, not far north, and arrived at my destination, which was the First Nursery in Beijing, which I had come to visit specifically today, sponsored by the Beijing Women's Cultural Promotion Association.</p>
<p>The nursery is located next to Xuanwu Lake, with beautiful scenery and fresh air. It is a Western-style Chinese building, with a lawn of several feet outside. There are small swings, sandboxes, and other children's play equipment. At the time, it was just the time for school to let out, and some little angels were still left in the playground. Each person wore a bib, some with light green trim and some with purple trim, all provided by the nursery, which were very neat and beautiful. These little angels mostly came from middle-class families, and their parents were educated with new knowledge and worked in various agencies in Beijing. Therefore, they were all unusually strong, clean, lively, and adorable.</p>
<p>After the reporter presented his name card, Ms. Huang Jie, the director of education at the nursery, came out to meet him. Ms. Huang has studied children's education extensively and has been engaged in kindergarten education for nearly 20 years, so her experience can be imagined. This time, she was hired to preside over the nursery's educational affairs and also serve as a childcare instructor. She is purely enthusiastic about public welfare, and no remuneration is discussed. Ms. Huang has six or seven sons and daughters, so she is also experienced in childcare. When she was talking to the reporter, her little daughter was playing in the sand next to her, lively, innocent, and very endearing, truly demonstrating the function of education, which cannot be compared with ordinary children.</p>
<p>The reporter inquired about the nursery's situation, and was introduced by Mr. Huang to Ms. Gong Mulan, the director of the nursery. Ms. Long studied early childhood education in the United States. Ms. Gong then described the origin, development, and current situation of the nursery, and gave me various regulations and forms. Then, she visited the nursery's classrooms, bedrooms, and other interior spaces, guided by Ms. Li Zhishan. Ms. Li is a veteran of the women's movement in Beijing and a key member of the Women's Cultural Promotion Association, and also one of the people in charge of the nursery.</p>
<p>The origin, development, and current situation of the nursery are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Origin—The First Nursery in Beijing is sponsored by the Beijing Women's Promotion Association. The association believes that the most important prerequisite for the modern women's movement is to solve the obstacles to women's work. Married women often have to stop engaging in social undertakings because they are responsible for raising children, which is the biggest obstacle to the women's movement. At the same time, some women must find jobs in society due to economic difficulties and cannot take care of their families. Furthermore, families below the middle class have limited financial resources, and if they do not want to educate their daughters sloppily in the old style, they cannot afford to provide the progressive methods of childcare and the various equipment for the life and education of children of different ages. Even if middle-class families can afford it, it is too uneconomical and unreasonable to waste money building each facility for a small number of children, and besides, not every woman has the talent to raise children well. Therefore, it is impossible for every mother to educate her own children. The ancients exchanged children to teach each other, which shows that China's inherent cultural education also advocates public childcare. Although some people now want to shout the slogan of women returning to the family, modern women only want to move forward. They know that on the one hand, they want to develop their individuality; on the other hand, they want to strengthen the country and build it, and children must have good training, but the two things are contradictory (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e227">Section 4: The Right of the First Night <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>"The Right of the First Night"—to modern people living in the "civilized" century, it seems like a mysterious and interesting thing in a "One Thousand and One Nights" fairy tale. But this is not a fairy tale, but a fact that did exist in our society more than a thousand years ago. It is not mysterious at all, but a blatant and legal historical fact of the trampling of women.</p>
<p>The so-called Right of the First Night is the superhuman right of feudal lords to sexually exploit serfs. In detail, in the feudal era, when all peasants got married, they had to let the landlord spend the first night with the bride, trampling on her virginity. Therefore, some people say that the lord is the "taster of all marriages."</p>
<p>The Right of the First Night was a legal system in the feudal era and has a long historical basis. According to Bebel, after the collapse of the matriarchal clan, women were exclusively occupied by men, but this violated the rules of the clan. Therefore, in the early days, when women got married, they first practiced sexual openness in the clan before going to marry a specific man. In the feudal era, this custom became the lord's Right of the First Night. This system does not seem to have existed in China, but in Europe, concrete evidence of it has been found in many historical legal documents. In Scotland, King Euvenus III issued a law stipulating that nobles had the right to spend the first night with the brides of all their peasants. This law was amended by King Malcolm in 1075, stipulating that peasants who wanted to redeem their brides' virginity had to pay a certain amount of money. There was also a similar law in France, and in Germany and Switzerland, the Right of the First Night was preserved until the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>With the collapse of the feudal system, the form of the Right of the First Night also changed. That is, peasants who wanted to get married only had to take out a considerable material equivalent to redeem their wives' virginity. In other words, material exploitation replaced sexual exploitation. Regarding this, there is the following passage in Bebel's "Woman and Socialism":</p>
<p>"When serfs and laborers got married, they had to entertain their master and his wife. Thus, the master participated in the wedding ceremony with a cart full of dried salaries. At the same time, the bride and groom presented a quarter of a roasted pig to the master. After the wedding ceremony, the groom had to give his wife's Right of the First Night to the master. If he was unwilling, he had to take out six shillings and four pence to redeem his wife's Right of the First Night."</p>
<p>Feudal lords interfered in the family life and marriage relations of peasants at any time and at will. Lords full of lust were not limited to the Right of the First Night; even in peacetime, they often forced the wives and daughters of peasants to satisfy their animal desires. Leo Sydrowitz, in his "History of Common Customs," repeatedly proved the historical fact that feudal lords arbitrarily trampled on the wives, daughters, and brides of peasants, saying:</p>
<p>"Ancient slaves had to be prepared to sacrifice their bodies at any time to satisfy the lust of their masters. Similarly, half of the women had to (put themselves) at his disposal in order to satisfy the lust of their masters (i.e., lords)."</p>
<p>From the standpoint of our women, the so-called Right of the First Night is not only the sexual exploitation of serfs by lords, but also the most extreme manifestation of the oppression of women's rights by male power. Even if the lord does not interfere in the family life of peasants, the status of women in peasant families is almost zero. The serf's wife is absolutely subordinate to her husband's slave. Not only do they have no freedom of love in the family, but they also bear the burden of difficult production labor, land cultivation and harvesting, livestock breeding, weaving and washing, and other endless labor. If they are not careful, they will be punished by their parents-in-law. Women in feudal society really lived a life of eighteen levels of hell.</p>
<p>Did the Right of the First Night system exist in China? There is no historical data to examine, so it is unknown. But in general, men still value their wives' Right of the First Night very much. In Guangdong, there is still a custom of "eating roasted pig." In detail, on the second day of the wedding, when the groom proves the bride's virginity (i.e., a disguised Right of the First Night system), the groom's family sends several roasted pigs to the bride's family to show their satisfaction. When this custom is linked to the "quarter of a roasted pig" in the quotation from Bebel above, it can be inferred that this system also existed in China.</p>
<p>This disguised Right of the First Night system exists as a very ordinary thing in modern "civilized" society. Modern men are still very concerned about the issue of whether the bride's hymen is broken. And they regard it as a matter of social morality for women. The news that a certain girls' school in Shandong examined the hymens of female students last year, regardless of whether it is true or not, is closely related to men's demand for women's Right of the First Night. However, the male-centered society does not care about the issue of whether the groom is chaste. Therefore, when we understand the Right of the First Night, we should not simply regard it as a special phenomenon of the feudal era. It is undoubtedly true that a disguised Right of the First Night system is practiced anytime and anywhere before the existing power system is eliminated!</p>

<h3 id="e230">How to Learn to Write Theoretical Articles? <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— An Amateur</p>
<p>If you want to write a theoretical article, you must first read a lot of works on that theory. Because you must have a system of that theory in your mind, and have rich content that constitutes this system, then you can write a perfect article about that theory. Secondly, in addition to working hard to read a lot, you also need to write more. I often see many hardworking young friends who have studied a number of theoretical books diligently. When others talk about the theory they are studying, they also know it very well, and sometimes even feel that others are not talking about it well. But if they are asked to talk about it, they cannot systematically express their opinions. What is the reason for this? That is because they just bury themselves in reading and do not write often, and do not regularly organize what they have learned from their research. Also, it is necessary for you to discuss with others, exchange opinions, and stimulate your feelings during research and writing. Therefore, Ouyang Xiu, who was good at writing articles, said: "There are three 'mores' in practicing writing: that is, more reading, more doing, and more discussion."</p>
<p>After the "three mores" of practicing writing have been achieved, you should pay special attention to the methods of writing:</p>
<p>First, every theoretical work must have one or more central ideas. Therefore, when you write a theoretical article, you must first determine the central idea you want to express, and then explain it in order from various aspects. Otherwise, you will be writing randomly, talking nonsense from here to there, and the result is that your article will not be systematic, will not have a center, and others will not understand it. For example, if you want to write an article on the writing style of a literary writer, then you should first determine such a central idea: the writer's writing style is determined by the ideological content he wants to express in his work, by the spirit of the era in which he lives, and by his personal and social environment; then you should use the principles of correct literary theory that you know to explain this central idea, and list the writing styles of literary writers from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, to prove the correctness of this central idea.</p>
<p>Second, after the central idea is established, you should plan how to organize this central idea and how to construct your theoretical system. To be more specific, you need to determine from which aspects you will explain your opinion; how many large paragraphs should be divided in your entire article. Let's take the above-mentioned article on the writing style of writers as an example. If you have decided to write this article and want to publish the above-mentioned central idea in this article, then you should condense that this article should be divided into these several large paragraphs: (1) What is "writing style"? (2) The content and form of literature, (3) The writer and society, (4) ... Then write down in order. In the middle of this, you need to collect a lot of practical material to discuss the writing styles of many writers from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, to show the correctness of your theory. Specifically, when you are writing this article, you must stand on the correct position that you know and discuss why classical writers value rules and pay attention to emotions, and why romantic writers are exactly the opposite; why Dostoevsky is so happy to start from the middle of the story when writing, so likes to arrange tense scenes in his works, and so profoundly describes the psychology of his protagonists; why Turgenev likes to start writing from the end of the story and likes to use the law of memory to unfold the story he describes; why the description of Cao Xueqin's "Dream of the Red Chamber" is so gentle, and how the style of his chapter novels appeared... - Based on these practical studies to enrich the content of your article and prove the correctness of your theory. In this way, your article will have practical content, will not be an empty theory, and will therefore be able to resonate with most readers.</p>
<p>Third, in detail, a theoretical article not only has its entire central idea, but also each of its large paragraphs, each of its small sections, and even each of its sentences has a central idea. An article without an overall central idea is an article with completely confused and contradictory theories; if a large paragraph or a small section does not have a central idea, it is also a partial confusion; similarly, if a sentence does not have a central idea, then the sentence is not coherent and cannot be a sentence. You know, the most important thing in a theoretical article is to explain the reasoning clearly, smoothly, and in an organized manner, but an organized, smooth, and clear article is composed of sentences, sections, and large paragraphs that express the central idea. Therefore, when you write a theoretical article, you must not only determine the entire system and divide the large paragraphs, but also clearly organize the central idea of each large paragraph, each small section, and each sentence in order.</p>
<p>Fourth, words and sentences are the foundation of an article, so sentence construction is very important for writing. The words and sentences of a theoretical article use abstract words to explain objective things, so each word and sentence must be in accordance with objective things; otherwise, it will not be coherent. For example, "The lion is a beast" is consistent with objective things and is coherent; but if you write a sentence in a theoretical article, "The lion is a big, beautiful, lively little girl", then it is an incoherent expression full of contradictions that is not consistent with objective things. At the same time, the composition of a theoretical article is to form sentences by combining words, form sections by combining sentences, form paragraphs by combining sections, form chapters by combining paragraphs, and form the full text, so when writing an article, not only must the sentences be smooth and clear, but also each paragraph and each section must be smooth, clear, and orderly.</p>
<p>Fifth, if you already have the above-mentioned knowledge and skills, you should pay attention to rhetoric. Theoretical articles value clarity, conciseness, and power, and sentence construction and rhetoric should be based on this principle. But you must pay attention not to deliberately be artificial, it must be natural. Some people often deliberately do things unnaturally because they pay too much attention to rhetoric, and the result is that it is worse, even making jokes. I once heard that there was an incompetent scholar who went to Beijing to take the exam, and wrote such a funny letter to his family in Beijing: "...Now I send back a pair of foot wrappings and socks. Wrapping means wrapping the feet, and socks means socks. Not saying foot wrapping socks, but saying wrapping socks is an abbreviation. There is a felt hat in the box, dry it when it is sunny, put it away when it rains, otherwise it will mold, mold will rot, and rot will not be a felt hat! My younger sister has grown up, do not let her go out, I am afraid that Wang Ermazi next door will have bad intentions again; however, the wall is several feet high, so it doesn't matter!" Although this is a humorous article in the form of a letter, it can also be used to illustrate the harm of deliberately being artificial in the rhetoric of writing theoretical articles.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Wounded Farmers <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Pingwen</p>
<p>My hometown—Jiading is only thirty kilometers away from Shanghai. That place can be said to be a township near a city, and it is also one of the million villages in China.</p>
<p>When I was young, this place was considered a relatively wealthy place among the surrounding villages, but now, in terms of field prices alone, in the past, there were very few people willing to sell for one or two hundred yuan per mu. By the end of last year, farmers who were bankrupt or needed money to pay off debts sold their fertile land at a low price of fifty yuan per mu, and it would still make people shake their heads!</p>
<p>The farmers' production technology, of course, still remains in the ancient empirical era. In addition to believing in their own hands, they also believe in heaven. In five or six years, famines followed one after another. They suffered from locust plagues, and the pain had not yet recovered. Then there was a major flood, and most of the agricultural products were submerged. The government was waiting for relief, followed by the iron hooves of Japanese imperialists, who broke into this broken village on March 3, 1932. The people were displaced, and spring plowing was therefore abandoned. In the following two years, either the weather was long and dry, and the wheat and barley were scorched, or the grain was cheap and hurt the farmers, which was not enough to cover the cost. The farmers' families in the past few years are simply similar to the situation described by the Taoist Banqiao as "selling new silk in May and threshing new grain in September to cure the sore in front of you and dig out the flesh in your heart."</p>
<p>Last year, a dozen or so enlightened people in the county initiated the organization of a cotton production and sales cooperative. On the one hand, they advocated the planting of 100,000-seed cotton and Jiangyin 100-seed cotton, and on the other hand, they formed their own sales office, no longer relying on merchants who exploited heavy profits. But the effect was rarely seen. As for the adjustment of the farmers' economy, it still mostly depends on the local tyrants and pawnshops. Some borrow bean cake and other fertilizers from the local tyrants at high interest rates. If they are unable to repay at the end of the year, the local tyrants force them to mortgage the land deed, writing</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>an interest rate of 20% to 30%, and compound interest must be calculated. In just a few years, the farmers' fields have all been changed to the household registration of the local tyrants. There are also some farmers who, whenever there is a shortage of food, carry bags and packages and wander under the high counter of the pawnshop. As for the Farmers' Bank, although it has been established for a long time, and its business has shown a trend of progress in recent years, it has little effect on the truly poor farmers, and even has nothing to do with the poor farmers. After January 28th, the only ×× pawnshop and its substitutes in the four villages were all closed. The reason, according to their superficial claim, was that they were affected by January 28th. In fact, it was because the pawnshops were not redeemed, so that the capital of the pawnshop owners became sluggish goods, and the financial turnover was not smooth, so they had to close. Later, although wealthy local gentry continued to take over the business under a changed name, this also shows the poverty of the rural economy in general.</p>
<p>Here I want to talk about the local famous specialty, the native cloth. In the past, whenever farmers were idle, the sound of looms could be heard in rural families. The native cloth produced each year could not only be used for clothing for the whole family, but also had a huge amount of exports each year. In the heyday of the native cloth industry, at five or six o'clock every morning, each cloth shop sent people to the market to take orders. At that time, weaving a bolt of cloth could earn two or three hundred wen. Weaving two bolts a day, although only four or five hundred wen of income, was still a small supplement to the farmers' family. However, in recent years, the native cloth industry has plummeted. On the one hand, the sales channels have become narrower, and on the other hand, the selling price has become lower. People who weave cloth see that there is no profit to be made, so they have to imitate the story of cooking cranes and cooking zithers.</p>
<p>Feudal ideology still dominates the entire Jiading. Just talking about the composition of marriage is still entirely a consistent way of buying and selling. There are many cases where people go bankrupt because they marry a wife, scrape around, and cannot repay the debt. Married life often cannot get the slightest happiness. Once a woman marries a husband, she has the idea of ​​following the chicken if she marries a chicken and following the dog if she marries a dog. The power of men dominates everything. Recently, there was a relatively brave woman who remarried a man after her husband died. Unfortunately, the second man also died. In this village shrouded in the old etiquette, she even more bravely automatically married a third man. This can be said to be a novel thing in the old village. It is natural that the woman is looked down upon by everyone. However, the woman's marriage is not due to her own awakening, but is still due to the pressure of life.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the farmers' livelihood cannot be maintained, but on the other hand, in recent years, the dragon boat races, village operas, temple fairs, and other actions that waste money and people have been staged one after another. On the surface, this seems to be a scene of a peaceful world, but who knows that this is dancing on a volcano? Many farmers frown all day long, but the young masters still have no shortage of leisurely elegance. They need sensual pleasure, and they need spiritual stimulation. So they gather a group of well-wishers and launch them to have fun with the farmers.</p>
<p>In this grand event full of elegance and vigor, a few small shops may be able to slightly excite the deserted market like a morphine injection, but what about our farmers? They have to entertain the wealthy relatives who come from afar, especially those snobbish wealthy relatives who come from the city. They usually don't interact with each other, but because of the grand event, the humble door welcomes distinguished guests. The farmers who are eating tomorrow's food today eat chaff and bran themselves, but they have to sincerely entertain the distinguished guests. They pawn their winter clothes out of the back door and bring in big fish and meat from the front door. They face the guests with a bitter smile. What a sad world this is!</p>
<p>Such a township, in China, is only a drop in the ocean, but its disease is precisely the disease of the entire nation, and its demise is precisely the demise of the entire China!</p>

<h3 id="e232">Talking About Fame <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Bei</p>
<p>When there were no people in the world, no, when all things were not yet born, the universe was originally just a "formless and nameless" thing, which Lao Tzu called "the beginning of heaven and earth without a name". Later, because of the cleverness of the human brain, all the images of worldly things were given a name, and since then, people have gained a concept of distinction for all worldly things (including people).</p>
<p>To investigate the origin of "name", it was originally just arbitrarily assumed for the sake of facilitating the recognition of things, but once assumed, the world became more eventful because of this.</p>
<p>Since people have given names to all things, and at the same time, there is a distinction between self and others among human beings, the development of "name" has become even more spectacular. First, the so-called "surname" was adopted by people, but because there were still drawbacks of confusion, a "name" was added under the surname, and hawkers and coolies might as well be named Zhang San, Li Si, Amao, Agou, and wealthy merchants were named with blessings, longevity, prosperity, etc. As for literati and elegant scholars, their names must not only strive for elegance such as benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and sincerity, but also need to take another "style name", and outside the "style name", they take another "pseudonym", and outside the "pseudonym", they take another "alternate pseudonym". The so-called "style name", "pseudonym", and "alternate pseudonym" are all just variations of the name. In ancient times, there were many people who held several "names" in one person.</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, there was a sensational movement to abolish surnames. Mr. Qian Xuantong resolutely advocated "keteing" the "surname" first. In order to show his determination, Mr. Qian took the lead in destroying the "Qian" of Qian Xuantong with one knife, and since then, Xuan Tong of our family has changed to "Doubting Antiquity Xuan Tong". This anecdote should of course be heavily recorded in the history of the evolution of names in the future.</p>
<p>However, people also have various ideas about their own names. One is represented by Zhuge Kongming of the Shu Han Dynasty. He said in the "Chu Shi Biao": "I don't want to be known among the princes." The so-called "I don't want to be known among the princes" means that he does not want to make his "name" known among the princes. He probably also understands the philosophy that "people are afraid of being famous and pigs are afraid of being fat", so he only wants to farm in Nanyang and does not want to be involved in the vortex of struggle. The second type is represented by people who are obsessed with fame and fortune. They are willing to have their names recorded in history books and passed down to future generations. Even when they are alive, they often want their names to be arranged in newspapers in large fonts every day. So they work hard and are afraid that their "name" will not come out! In order to get their own "name" out, they do not hesitate to use all kinds of clever methods, roundabout methods, flattery and horse-shooting. It is quite ridiculous to say, but those who are involved in it do not feel ashamed.</p>
<p>The most famous people at present, apart from those in the political arena, are the most famous movie stars, dance stars, actors, athletes, and swimmers. Like Hu Die's empress, the Liang family's sisters, Mei Lanfang's doctor, Zhou Xianyan's iron gate, and Yang Xiuqiong's mermaid, who doesn't know who?</p>
<p>However, fame is the source of all disasters. The laws of nature are obvious and cannot be avoided. Because Empress Hu Die's name was used as a trademark, it has already caused two companies to sue in the past. Now, the name rights of the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong have been infringed and asked attorney Song Yunhui to declare that there is only one family and no branch in the future. The successive brilliance makes us sigh that we dare not force ourselves to look at this famous name.</p>
<p>According to people, Ruan Lingyu's death was because she was afraid of being burdened by her great fame due to marriage disputes, so she committed suicide. Then fame! Fame! It is actually the source of disaster. Fame can be had and cannot be had!</p>
<p>I remember that someone said: "Bodhi is not a tree, a bright mirror is not a stand. Originally there is nothing, where does the dust come from?" I wonder what those who run after fame and fortune will think when they read these words?</p>

<h3 id="e233">Beggars in Guangzhou <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Anren</p>
<p>To be fair, everything in Guangzhou has been progressing steadily in recent years. For example, tall Western-style buildings, asphalt roads, huge department stores, magnificent restaurants, automobiles, women, and... well, everything in Guangzhou is constantly increasing and changing. If you don't go out for a few days, you'll feel like everything has changed beyond recognition. However, Guangzhou, like other cities, has a social phenomenon that cannot be improved, and this phenomenon is even expanding day by day in Guangzhou, which is the so-called unsightly beggar class.</p>
<p>Some people may say that I am deliberately exaggerating to attract attention when I say that beggars can form a class. However, according to the actual situation in Guangzhou, they are indeed a part of this society. According to investigations, their actual number reaches more than 40,000. If we take the total population of Guangzhou as a ratio, approximately one out of every ten people is a beggar.</p>
<p>The origins of these beggars vary. Some were born into wealthy families, and were accustomed to extravagance and debauchery. When their wealth was exhausted and they had no skills to make a living, they had no choice but to make the street corner their last resort. Some were born into beggar families (?), and naturally had no opportunity to receive education and learn skills to make a living. Therefore, they inherit the family trade and become beggars with ease. In addition to the above two sources, the tide of unemployment has also swept in many beggars.</p>
<p>Considering the total population of Guangzhou, it is indeed very difficult to constantly provide for the livelihood of one out of every ten people. However, these beggars are not like the beggars in Shanghai, who ask people for money on the street all day long, causing people to feel a headache and resentment at the sight of them. They will never ask others to fulfill their obligations for no reason. Therefore, although there are so many beggars in Guangzhou, it is not like in Shanghai, where you can hear the cries of beggars asking for money wherever you go. They have many ways to make a living, which can be roughly divided into two types: mental labor and manual labor. During the day, manual labor involves picking up cigarette butts on the street, and at night, they carry a broken bamboo basket through the alleys, rummaging through trash cans. Scraps of cloth, waste paper, broken glass, and tin cans are all their targets. Those who are young and strong carry sedan chairs and flagpoles for ceremonial shops, doing similar rough work. Mental labor, on the surface, seems to be very leisurely and comfortable, but it is not easy for those who are not good at scheming to handle. They run around on various roads and streets all day long, trying to find out what weddings, funerals, or other celebrations are taking place in people's homes. They investigate clearly and report back to their fellow beggars, and then send someone to make arrangements at the home of the person holding the event. If it is a wedding, they will paste a red paper strip about three inches long and one and a half inches wide on the wall at the entrance, with the words "Huazi Zhong Ji" (Beggars' Collective Record) engraved on the strip. If it is a funeral, they will paste a blue paper strip on the wall outside, below the foot of the wall, so that people will not notice it. If it is a birth announcement, they will simply ask the household for a red envelope or ginger and vinegar, and also paste a red paper strip on the wall at the entrance. This procedure is similar to the government requiring people to register. When their fellow beggars see this kind of strip, they know what is happening in the household. The households treat these beggars according to their own circumstances: some provide them with food and wine for a day, or just one meal. However, at the very least, they must give them a table of leftovers. When they come here to eat, they are as polite as other guests. Moreover, everyone has to stand in a circle at the entrance and say many auspicious words before the leader of the group goes inside to carry the dishes outside, and then they sit on the ground and start to feast.</p>
<p>They all develop their own methods of making a living to the best of their ability, but their actions are restricted by the group. If there is any transgressive behavior or actions that undermine the group, the leaders will investigate and punish them severely, which is unmatched by the general current laws. The highest authority that manages them is the "Huazi Hui" (Beggars' Association), and all the beggars in the city are members of this association. The organization of this association is like that of ordinary social groups, with a chairman, directors, and other positions. To be a chairman, one must have a deep reputation among the beggars and also have considerable power. If something happens to any member, the chairman must find a way to help. Under this association, there are many small groups, and each group also has an experienced beggar as the group leader. All the actions of the members of this group must be under the command of the group leader. The work they go out to do is assigned by the group leader in advance before they carry it out. If they get any extra money outside, they must bring it back and hand it over to the group leader for distribution without hiding anything.</p>
<p>The job of picking up cigarette butts is very easy. Every day, from morning to night, they wander around the streets or at the entrances of department stores and restaurants, or at movie theaters and train stations, because there are many people coming and going in these places, and the production of cigarette butts is also abundant. However, beggars who are generally experienced in picking up cigarette butts do not pay much attention to cigarette butts on the street, because there are many people coming and going on the street, and the cigarette butts that are left over are not necessarily good quality tobacco, and the selling price is also very limited. Their best destinations are dance halls and high-end movie theaters, or the entrances of high-class brothels. People who come here to smoke do not smoke cheap tobacco, and most of them smoke high-end foreign cigarettes. Moreover, the cigarette butts that are left over are long. The value of picking up one of these cigarette butts is simply several times that of those ordinary cigarette butts.</p>
<p>According to the Social Bureau's investigation, there are about 2,200 people living by picking up cigarette butts here, but the actual number is probably even more than that. In the total number of members of the "Huazi Hui" (Beggars' Association), they account for about 20% or more. Their whereabouts, broadly speaking, are only divided into two major areas: Henan and Hebei. Because business in Hebei is sluggish, only one-tenth of the people work there. Because the business area in Henan is larger, it is further divided into four areas: Henanwei, Fuchangyuan, Dajitou, and Longweidao. Each area has a regional leader who supervises the beggars picking up cigarette butts in this area. In addition to monitoring the actions of his subordinates, the leaders of each area usually also engage in the side business of "second-hand cigarettes." The "extra money" earned by the beggars picking up cigarette butts in each area must be shared with the leader of the area. The leader collects these cigarette butts and estimates them, and after deducting what he is entitled to, he buys the rest with his own money as raw materials for "second-hand cigarettes." The so-called "second-hand cigarettes" are made by mixing all the cigarette butts that are picked up, regardless of quality, and re-rolling them into paper cigarettes by hand, selling them in packs of ten or twenty to coolies and rickshaw pullers at the docks for their enjoyment. The price is of course several times cheaper than ordinary cigarettes. Although these regional leaders are also beggars, their living conditions are not worse than those of rickshaw pullers who live by selling their labor. Their daily income is one and a half yuan at most, and three or four cents at least. But the income of beggars picking up cigarette butts is much less. At most, they can only earn two cents a day, and it is not uncommon to even have "no rice to cook." Fortunately, they are very loyal. If someone has no rice to cook, and someone else gets a good haul, they will still share it with him. Therefore, their two meals a day are not a problem. What they consider difficult to solve is the problem of housing. Because Guangzhou does not have as many alleys as Shanghai for them to use as temporary dormitories, and the number of beggars is so large, they often end up with nowhere to go. Although the Guangzhou authorities have now set up labor offices and civilian shelters to accommodate these beggars, because the number of people is too large, they still cannot accommodate them all.</p>
<p>In short, the more this group of beggars living a special life expands, the more it shows the unrest in society, and at the same time, it is a sign of the decline of a nation!</p>

<h3 id="e235">Explanation of Poetry <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Qitian</p>
<p>Poetry is a branch of literature, and its general nature and function are of course the same as those of literature. However, when it comes to poetry, people immediately think of problems such as "rhythm" and "form." The so-called "rhyme is poetry, no rhyme is prose" is the general explanation of poetry by oriental scholars since ancient times. At the same time, even among Western poets and literary scholars, many people's understanding of poetry is completely based on form and rhythm. For example, the poet Allan Poe said that poetry is "the creation of beautiful rhythm"; Professor Grote said that poetry is "the art of accurately expressing thoughts and emotions in rhymed language to create pleasure"; Leigh Hunt paid special attention to the rhythm of poetry, and he often explained poetry in terms of rhythm.</p>
<p>It is true that poetry has rhythm, tone, and even form. Whether it is ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, poetry is not absolutely unrelated to these. However, this kind of rhythm, tone, and form are not fixed, and there are no differences and changes in ancient and modern times, Chinese and foreign countries. Five-character poems, seven-character poems, and modern new poems each have their internal rhythm, tone, and form, but they are all different. In modern new poems, there are various different forms. The so-called rhythm, tone, and form can only be used as elements of poetry in such a relative sense. But this is not to say that only poetry has these elements, and nothing else does. In fact, announcements and spells have a certain rhythm, tone, and form, and they have those elements, but they cannot be called poetry. Therefore, we should say that poetry has a certain rhythm, tone, and form, but having rhythm, tone, and form is not necessarily poetry. At the same time, if we absolutize rhythm, tone, and form, and say that poetry must have a certain rhythm, tone, and form, for example, saying that poetry must have a certain number of words per line, a certain number of lines per poem, and must have rhymes, and even each line must have a certain number of stressed or unstressed syllables, then we can say that those who have such rhythm, tone, and form can naturally be called poetry, but those who do not have it are not necessarily not poetry.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the so-called rhythm, tone, and form are not the only fundamental meaning of existence of poetry. It is inappropriate to use them to explain poetry or to define poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry, especially modern poetry, seems to have nothing to do with human life on the surface. Therefore, people's explanations of poetry are most likely to lead to mysterious discussions. The formalists of ancient and modern times, Chinese and foreign countries, of course cannot jump out of the circle of rhythm, tone, and form in their explanations of poetry. The theologians who are closely linked to formalism cannot be separated from the labyrinth of "inspiration" and even God in their explanations of poetry. The famous ancient philosopher Plato said: "Poets do not write poetry by art, but by inspiration, and in a state of divine possession. Therefore, those who are good at poetry must lose their sense of smell when they are writing poetry, just like the dance of the Korybantes. Because poetry is light, it has wings, and it is a sacred creature. Only when inspired, when the senses lose their effectiveness, and when reason loses its control, can one write poetry." This is of course the most mysterious statement. However, it is not surprising that this kind of statement originated in ancient society. The most unfortunate thing is that there are still some professors living in the twentieth century who recognize this statement of Plato in ancient times as correct, and publicly say that "there is indeed something incomprehensible about poetry," which is really the most ignorant expression!</p>
<p>In fact, although poetry is farther away from human social life, it cannot exist without human social life. No matter what form of poetry, or even any mysterious view of poetry, is a product of society. Plato's mysterious opinions originated in ancient slave society; the above-mentioned formalist explanations of poetry are also a reflection of the life consciousness of the people who only seek form and do not talk about content.</p>
<p>We know that singing about love can be said to be one of the main expressions of poetry. But the so-called love is not really dominated by the mysterious god of love. It is also a social phenomenon, and therefore even "pure" lyrical poetry is a reflection of human social life. Ikuchi said: "Those who argue that poetry has nothing to do with all social life are also committing serious mistakes in love poetry. We certainly admit that the root of the poems created by the god of love is often the same. People generally praise the beauty of their lovers. However, the method of expression has undergone profound changes with social changes. If you don't believe it, we only need to compare the love of the Middle Ages or the era of Louis XIV with that of the nineteenth century to understand it. Like the wandering poets, like the knights who worship their lovers with mysterious enthusiasm, like the elegant courtiers of the 'great century' who are eager for fame and whose words are extremely ornate, and finally like the passionate men Musset, Baudelaire, or Hana of the previous century, how profound are the differences in their expressions of passion!" Countless examples of the differences in love in different eras and societies can also be found in China. We see that there are great differences between the love poems in the "Book of Songs," the concept of love expressed in "Romance of the West Chamber," and the love situations depicted in "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Golden Lotus"? Needless to say, the reason for this difference lies in the society that produced them.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that even love poetry is a work of art produced by society.</p>
<p>If we go further to examine the origin of poetry, the problem will become clearer. Here we can quote the following passage——</p>
<p>"Poetry begins where human language begins. The natural calls that accompany the efforts of primitive people are the embryos of words, the initial expression; these calls arise from action, and they are precisely some natural and understandable expressions of action. These labor calls become the root of labor songs. Singing is not just a matter of entertainment or relaxation. When people are working together, lyrics can unite the efforts of workers, giving them a kind of harmony, a rule of rhythm and conformity."</p>
<p>This kind of situation can also be found in many folk songs that are popular everywhere now, so there is no need to make more citations.</p>
<p>In short, whether from the essence, composition, or origin, poetry is inseparable from human social life. Poetry can be said to be the highest form of literature. If literature is an artistic reflection of social life by means of the tool of writing, then poetry, as the highest form of literature, expresses social life in its own unique poetic form—rhythm, tone, and form. The essence and function of poetry, novels, and dramas are not fundamentally different. They are all literature. If we want to say that there are differences between them, then these differences only exist in the external form, and do not exist in their essence.</p>

<h3 id="e236">The Pure Poet Shelley (5) <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Japanese Tsurumi Yusuke, translated by Zhou Leshan and Qi Junfu</p>
<p>Shelley felt the pain to his core after he realized it. He knew his wife’s strong jealousy was caused by his interaction with other women and the misunderstandings it created. He felt nothing but contempt for his wife from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>After all sorts of unpleasant incidents occurred between the two, Shelley realized he could no longer change his wife’s mind, and thus fell into the abyss of pain and despair.</p>
<p>Disappointed with his stubborn wife’s attitude, Shelley walked alone down the street, chanting "Ice-like heart, large block of ice," aimlessly wandering the streets of London. His chest was filled with grief, so sad that he could not even shed tears.</p>
<p>At this moment, like the rising sun in his world, Mary Godwin, Godwin's biological daughter, suddenly appeared. Godwin was still traveling in Scotland at this time.</p>
<p>She was a slender, thin girl with hazel eyes and fluffy golden hair. However, hidden within her weak appearance was a dignified and strong soul. This type of woman, possessing feminine grace and the courage of a lioness, was the ideal woman Shelley was seeking. Moreover, she had her father's inherited intellect and possessed the cultivation to discuss philosophy and poetry in a comprehensive manner. Disappointed with his wife's low level of cultivation, Shelley was guided by this bright star, naturally unfolding like facing the spring sunshine.</p>
<p>However, Shelley, who was completely different from ordinary people, did not hold emotions beyond friendship towards Mary. From his youth, he had a peculiar quirk, which was to strive to illuminate the hearts of those he came into contact with with the light within his own heart. Therefore, regardless of whether the other party was male or female, he only knew how to speak of the truth and beauty of life and enlighten that person. He did not notice how the vibrant, brilliant, and beautiful appearance of his beauty evoked gratitude in the hearts of young members of the opposite sex. He was still innocent and carefree. From this point of view, he was also very ignorant of worldly affairs.</p>
<p>Now he discovered that young and beautiful Mary was his like-minded friend, but how could he know that Mary had fallen in love with him at first sight after their initial meeting!</p>
<p>The two intimately held hands and roamed the suburbs.</p>
<p>She accompanied Shelley to the graveside of her own biological mother—Godwin’s former wife—and sat beside the gravestone. Shelley talked about life and spoke of poetry. And he gave her his long poem *Queen Mab*. At that time, he printed 250 copies at his own expense. It was written when he was eighteen years old.</p>
<p>That night, Mary wrote on the title page of the poem after she returned home:</p>
<p>"Perhaps this title page will not be seen by others, so I dare to boldly write what I want to write. My love for the author of this poem is beyond description. ‘Even if I never belong to you one day, I will never belong to anyone else.’ I swear this in my heart."</p>
<p>Shelley's heart, disappointed with his wife, flowed towards Mary day by day like facing the water. Finally, with the simplicity of a young man, he expressed that he had another love and requested a separation from Harriet. Starting from his principles, he thought that the separation of two people who did not love each other was very legitimate, but the rules of society did not allow it, and Harriet, who had not completely lost her love, was very difficult to agree to. However, Shelley, believing in his wife's infidelity, thought it was improper to continue the worldly form of marriage in any case.</p>
<p>He finally took Mary across the sea and eloped to France. Mary's stepsister, Jane, accompanied them.</p>
<p>From that day on, society began to persecute him severely. This persecution haunted him until his death.</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>When the three arrived in Paris, they were penniless.</p>
<p>He pawned his watch and chain for 160 francs. He also borrowed 600 yuan from a banker in Paris with a letter of introduction, and the three began their journey to Switzerland.</p>
<p>They wanted to take a post horse carriage, but they did not have enough travel expenses, so he decided to walk. He then came up with a wonderful idea, which was to buy a donkey to carry the luggage, and the three took turns riding. The next morning, he went to the livestock market and bought a very small donkey. This little donkey carried the three of them, heading far away to the Alps.</p>
<p>Guarded by this young man with the grace of a young girl, the two young ladies rode a small donkey on the village roads of France, which were in turmoil after Napoleon's defeat and the dispersal of millions of soldiers. After walking many miles, the donkey could not walk any further, so Shelley and Jane took turns dragging the donkey.</p>
<p>That night, in the village where they stayed, they sold this little donkey and bought another donkey.</p>
<p>The French villages that had been looted by the invading enemy army were short of food. The so-called inns were just a name. The three of them trembled in the unheated inns. Swarms of rats harassed them from time to time. In this way, they continued their journey.</p>
<p>They were not robbed by bandits, nor did they catch a cold, and they quickly found a small town, Brunnen, on the shore of Lake Lucerne in central Switzerland. They rented two rooms in a villa, bought tables and chairs, and wanted to "live here permanently." But the old stove could not be lit no matter what. The cold winter wind of the Alps kept blowing. He said, "Let's go back," and the next day he hurried away from here and returned to London.</p>
<p>When he stepped into the streets of London, he was penniless as usual. Because he did not have money to pay for the carriage, he ran to the bank, only to find that all the previous deposits had been withdrawn by his wife Harriet. He ran to Harriet's house and only managed to get a few pounds to move into a dirty hotel.</p>
<p>Mary's father, Godwin, forbade his two daughters to interact with Shelley. Godwin's political justice said: "If you marry someone you don't love, it is better to live with someone you love." This kind of thinking penetrated the minds of the young Shelley. Therefore, Shelley wrote a letter to Godwin explaining this intention, but the reply said: "That kind of thinking can be implemented in Utopia, but it is impossible in modern society."</p>
<p>Shelley, who was in difficulty, also heard that his creditors were going to ask the court to issue an arrest warrant, and he might be imprisoned at any time. This debt was caused by the loss of Godwin's cultural enterprise. He managed to borrow more than 10,000 yuan to pay his debt. Not only that, Godwin also asked him for money and urged him by letter.</p>
<p>Alarmed by these many things, Shelley wrote to Godwin saying that he had no reason to do so. On the one hand, he urged him to pay, but on the other hand, he did not allow him to meet him. The old philosopher thought, if he allowed a man who had taken his daughter in an improper way to come to his home, and also borrowed money from that man, he was afraid that the world would criticize him for exchanging his daughter for money, so he only replied that he wanted money, and that meeting was impossible.</p>
<p>Shelley sacrificed a lot of money for this old philosopher, but he did not hate this person. He was a person who did not hold feelings of hatred for those who harmed him. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e239">Wildcat Hugging a Lamb <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The warm sun shines warmly on a small village at the foot of the Great Wall. "Old Man Bitter" Wang Guilin, wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket, is sunbathing by the haystack. In front of the door, the old ewe, chewing dry grass, is tied up, and a pure white, lovely lamb is suckling at its mother's teat.</p>
<p>Afeng Wang Renmei, who had drifted away, transformed from a village girl to a metropolitan modern lady. Following the Sun Song and Dance Troupe, which travels everywhere to sing, she went north, carrying a rattan bag and a bundle, and returned. She felt the boredom of urban life and the fun of rural scenery. She picked up the pure white lamb and gave a naive smile to the sisters-in-law and sisters who surrounded her.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Star Behind the Scenes <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>(1) Zheng Zhengqiu, Xu Xinfu, and Li Pingqian, three directors, and the Gu sisters, Meijun and Lanjun, etc., went to Hangzhou to attend the 4th Annual Meeting of the China Educational Film Association and have now returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Xu Xinfu recently compiled a new script called "Emerald Horse," which has been reviewed and approved.</p>
<p>(3) "Boat Woman," directed by Shen Xiling, will soon be filming outdoor scenes at West Lake, after which the entire film can be completed.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Ye Qiuxin Goes to the Battlefield <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Ye Qiuxin joined the Star Film Company, playing important roles in "National Soul" and "Big Family," which are enough to show off her acting talent. She plays a brave female student in "National Soul" who leaves her gentle family and steps onto the war-torn battlefield. Yesterday, a scene on the battlefield was filmed. A large trench was set up on the Star Outdoor Photography Site. Barbed wire and sandbags showed a serious war atmosphere. Tense photography work was carried out amidst the sound of artillery fire. When this scene was over, Ye Qiuxin was covered in mud, because some trenches had water in them. However, Ye Qiuxin said: "Filming is really enjoyable. In such a tense and stimulating environment, I feel that life is much more fulfilling. I almost suspect that I have really gone to the battlefield!"</p>
<h3 id="e242">Never Heard Since Ancient Times: Son Becomes Grandson <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Qin Tong, who is good at playing old men, is showing his skills again in "At the Beginning of Man," playing Wei Heling's father. How his acting skills are, although it cannot be predicted, but based on his past achievements in "Feihua Village" and "Escape," he will naturally give us a satisfying performance in "At the Beginning of Man."</p>
<p>Qin Tong plays Wei Heling's father in "At the Beginning of Man," and his son also has a cameo in "At the Beginning of Man," but plays Wei Heling's son. In this way, his son has become his grandson. Son becomes grandson, don't you think this is a strange thing that has never been heard of since ancient times?</p>
<p>The strange things in "At the Beginning of Man" are not only this one, there are many other kinds of strange things.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Hu Jia Sings "Goddess" Song in Tears <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Qiezi Girl, who is good at singing and dancing, plays a poor girl who fell into the fire pit in "Boat Woman," singing a tragic "Goddess" song in front of the wine and red lights. When this scene was being filmed, the people visiting the site were all moved by her song. The plot of the play is like this: In a brothel room, the beginning is to shoot the scene of those rich young masters insulting prostitutes, mixed with many unpleasant nonsense words. In extreme unbearable circumstances, the prostitute is forced to urge a song. Hu Jia is playing the role of this prostitute. She swallowed a large glass of wine, stood up and sang the "Goddess" song. Gradually, the moving lyrics grabbed Hu Jia's emotions. When she sang to the middle, Hu Jia's tears could not help but pour out of her eyes. At the end, she was lying on the table, sobbing uncontrollably. Such a scene was performed very movingly by Hu Jia! Everyone felt a little sad.</p>
