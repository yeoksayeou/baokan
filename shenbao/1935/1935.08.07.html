<p>時評</p>
<h3>意阿事件之現階段</h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>國聯理事會所通過之意阿問題决議。分析言之。可得四要點。第一。根據今年五月二十五日决議案。遵照一九二八年意阿條約第五條。繼續其伸裁工作。此點乃國聯處理本案之基本原則。今日與五月間局勢相較。可謂並無變化。第二。仲裁委員會對於華爾華爾地方之主權問題。不容爭辯。此點為墨索里尼主張之勝利。第三。立卽指派第五仲裁員。此點為國聯五月决議案之見諸實行者。第四。規定本年九月四日召集國聯理事會。或審查伸裁結果。或將意阿問題通盤討論。此點對於意阿爭端前途較有重大之涵義。</p>
<p>國聯能否以和平方式。謀意阿爭端之解决。其關鍵全在力求消弭戰禍之列强。取如何態度。作如何努力。是以列強之外交活動。實較國聯形勢尤可注意。英法代表曾於國聯理事會開議前。與意國代表共同聲明。根據一九〇六年三國條約。在法國舉行外交談判。雖結果如何未可逆料。然此點固係英國駐意大使德魯蒙曾一再與墨索里尼接洽而未奏效者。今則三國已有一致之表示矣。或謂此乃國聯範圍以外之行動。有損國聯之機能。或謂將阿比西尼亞接棄門外。英法意有瓜分東菲之嫌。此等局外輿論。姑置不辯。總之。在此一觸卽發之嚴重危局中。為各方面留一從容談判之餘地。不可謂非和平運動中之一綫生機也。</p>
<p>至于置身局外。而有左右國聯能力之美國。對於此案。態度果何如乎。美國近方埋頭於國內之復興運動。對于遠東尚且觀望。對于東菲自更不願自尋煩惱。自羅斯福總統宣布睦隣政策。態度尤為明顯。蓋菲洲素為歐人之殖民地。菲洲所產之原料。中美南美所在多有。美國對菲略有關係者。不過列波利亞及阿比西尼亞兩獨立國。前者以美洲黑人移殖之故。美處保護人之地位。後者。則亦不過略有外交關係而已。至阿比西尼亞之成為問題。在英法因其為南北發展（開浦鎭至開羅之聯接計畫）及東西發展（凡爾堤角至法屬索瑪里之打通計畫）兩條路綫之接觸點。在意則為其東菲獨佔計畫中之目的物。此于美殊無直接關係可言。此其所以不願牽入旋渦也。然而維持世界和平。美與英法實有同感。故美就道義方面及外交方面。亦願稍稍用力。觀於美外長赫爾為非戰公約事答覆。阿比西尼亞。及今次國聯開會時羅斯福總統在華府之間接發言。遙為英方聲援。可知美國客觀意向之所在矣。</p>

<p>（東京）據東報所記載、京圖路之遭難係自一九三二年十一月十七日、義軍襲營城子站以來、因日滿軍警備力甚充足、迄今平安無事、近忽有此禍、而且在旁晚圍攻、實為大膽無敵之舉動、今年以來、火車被擊已有六起、均帶有共產色彩之義軍、其行動戰術甚巧妙毀路情形如左、</p>

<h3>德內部隱憂未已　嚴防反對派活動　柏林全城高揭紅字榜　羅馬敎皇面諭德敎友</h3>
<p>（柏林）全城各處現有高十尺之紅字榜示、文曰、「日耳曼人其聽諸、反動份子現正在活動、其防莠徒羊皮而狼心來就爾等、」此為清除反對國社黨者之總運動之最近行動、夜間現有衝鋒隊乘馬達敝車巡邏全城、大呼淸除反對國社黨者之口號、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）德國司法部長蓋德納下令、對於違禁携帶軍火者、嚴加懲治、俾藉此杜絕仇視國家之各項團體活動、命令中謂違禁携帶軍火者、僅就其本人加以懲罰、尚有未足、必須根究其在暗中供給軍火之秘密團體、以期一網打盡、且自外國非法運入軍火之舉、可因此加以嚴密監察云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國文化恊會頃通告各猶太人組織之文化及藝術團體、着於八月三十一日以前、組織德國猶太人文化團體協會、嗣後僅限參加此項恊會之團體、始能對外活動、但此項措施、並不包括猶太人所辦之學校以及教會方面之團體云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）法庭今日已將共產黨人開塞爾判决死刑、其罪狀為意圖叛國云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>梵諦岡　頃有德國德萊武城之靑年教友五十人來此謁見教皇、談及最近該國反教運動、教皇特向之面諭、謂「若干倡立新異教主義之人士、竟向耶穌掀起鬥爭、吾人每一念及、實深憂戚、但一念德國境內、尚有若許靑年信徒、虔誠不拔、則亦自可喜耳、總之、德國近日情勢、在精神上對余所生之反嚮、亦可喜、亦可悲、如是而已」云、又教皇本日接見柏林總主教潑萊辛、有所商談、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>梵諦岡　教皇今日向朝謁教庭之德人五十演說、謂彼頗欲為所有德國天言教徒徒福、因彼等在目前非常困難之時、仍能奮力衛道、惟教皇亦警告德人、將來之情形或將更為困難云、（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>英法意　下週巴黎開會　談判阿比西尼亞問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）刻正着手準備擬於下週初在巴黎或巴黎附近開始英法意關於阿比西尼亞問題之談判、今晨英閣員艾登向外相霍爾詳細報告上週國聯行政院所成立意阿爭議之折衷辦法、衆料三國討論之初期中不請阿代表參加、但將以討論情形通知駐法阿使、同時倫敦官塲否認英國禁止英人投效阿國之說、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）聞阿國堅持調解委員會雁研究甚畫界線問題、故該委員會現已發生困難、羅馬人士以為阿國如果堅持不讓、則根據星期六日國聯行政院所通過之决議案而召集之調解委員會會議、將為不可能、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼又調　七萬大軍赴菲　航空次長前往檢閱空軍</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意國雖已依允遵守國聯關于意阿爭議之折衷辦法、但仍積極備戰、今日發出命令、再徵七萬兵赴東菲、其中常備軍兩師團、黑衫兵一師、其他軍隊行將召集、以補充國內兵力、同時現有數船裝貨甚忙、準備開往菲洲、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意相墨索里尼本日又下令動員陸軍兩師開往東菲、其一為「阿西亞泰師」集中阿帝地方、以李加爾提將軍為司令官、其一為「柯色里亞師」集中英貝里亞地方、以奔多爾將軍為司令官、此外僑居外國之意國志願軍及前參戰軍人、則由受短期訓練之陸軍學生領帶、編成法西斯黨黨軍第六師、集中待發、而以巴斯加爾底將軍任司令官、以上各師動員經過、均甚良好、至目前為止、總計開往東菲洲之意大利軍隊、當達十二師、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）墨索里尼今日又動員六萬五千軍隊、開赴東菲、略謂國聯行政院雖已將意阿邊境事伴交付伸裁、成立和解辦决、然兩國關係依然緊張、意大利為未雨綢總計、實有繼續動員之必要也、（六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）墨索里尼鑒於阿比西尼亞不絕調動軍隊、今午發出第九批軍隊之動員令、此批軍隊計有二師、為向駐法國邊境之披特門省者、（六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）本日意大利政府復行動員「阿西亞泰師」與「柯色里亞師」開往東菲、已見哈瓦斯社前電、該兩師關往東菲後、總計在東菲意軍共達十二師、其中陸軍七師、法西斯黨軍五師、除以上十二師外、現復將僑居國外之意國志願軍、編成黨軍一師、準備開往東菲、又據「大戰時志願兵士恊會」報告、志願兵士已獲准許、開往東菲者、計二千人、尚有四千人請求從軍、則尚在審核中、此外首相墨索里尼之婿、現任宣傳部長齊亞諾伯爵、亦將赴東菲、担任軍職、按意國在東菲軍事準備、於七月杪稍見緩和、近日則又復加速進行、蓋意國政府認為根據一九〇六年條約、舉行英法意三國會議、以解决意阿問題、未必能有滿意結果、且卽令三國間成立恊定、准許意國在阿比西尼亞、發展經濟勢力、則為保護意國經濟利益起見、亦有在東菲增加警備之必要、意大利所以繼續派兵前往東菲者以此故也、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）航空次長伐雷將軍頃飛往東菲意屬伊里特里亞、檢閱空軍、平均飛行速率每小時三百五十公里、飛行高度約四五千公尺、歸程則於淸晨五時、離瑪賽華港、在埃及京城稍事停降、卽於午後五點四十五分抵羅馬、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞　仍懼意國備戰　電謝各國主持和平　阿皇延見美國代表</h3>
<p>阿京　國聯行政院會議通過意阿爭議决議案之消息旣布、徒令人心益為悲憤、咸謂意國在行政院重行集議前之一個月內更可從容作戰爭準備、阿政府某大員今日語客稱、意國始終不作不訴諸武力之宣言、阿國殊為扼腕、意國一日無此確切宣言、則可多作喧傳已久之進攻準備一日、同時吾人掬誠接受國聯之建議、但國聯之實力能否使其發生效果、令人不可無疑云、此間收到國聯决議案之全文後、即發表文告、謂國聯行政院决議於九月四日開會對意阿關係各點作一總檢討、阿政府對此深為滿意、阿政府在過去八月中要求作此檢討、從未稍懈云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　阿皇今日正式引見美國代辦安格德、當時阿皇對於羅斯福總統上星期之聲明、曾向安氏表示謝忱、並稱之爲美國人民性好和平之例證、並盛讚美國教士在阿之工作、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）阿皇今日致電國聯行政院、申謝各國對於維持東非和平之努力、並稱彼已决意使意阿爭端、得到公正和平之解决云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯秘書處接阿皇四日謝電、促請代向努力通過行政院决議之各國代表申謝、並謂阿國政府今後重申其和平及公道解决此項爭端之决心、希望國聯努力和平、定底於成云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　外交部頃對國聯會行政院日前通過之决議案、發表公報如下、「國聯會行政院於八月三日通過之决議案兩伴、阿國政府頃已閱悉、此後關於華爾華爾事件之責任問題、當由第五伸裁員决定之、根據行政院第一伴决議案將兩遇爭議加以仲裁似屬可能之舉、但無論仲裁委員會如何决定、意大利官方所繪地圖中、曾將華爾華爾劃在阿國領士以內之一事實、則决難掩飾、至於意國前所提出之備忘錄、則僅匪指陳目下之華爾華爾、已被意國軍隊實質的佔頒而已、關於行政院之第二件决議案、規定由行政院於九月四日開會就意阿爭端、作全盤之考慮、此舉自足使阿國政府完全滿意、蓋阿國皇帝要求行政院處理意阿爭端、已八閱月於茲、此種政策、始終不變也」云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿京　今日此間發表聲明、對國聯行政院此次對意阿問題之决議有所批評、謂華爾華爾地屬阿國境內、此在意大利之地圖上、亦明白劃出、且數年前、意大利會向阿發出備忘錄、聲明華爾華爾由意國軍隊佔領、尤見華爾華爾乃阿國領士、仲裁委員會對子此點實不容全　加以漠視也、該聲明書對于行政院之　第三次决議、表示滿意、蓋阿比西尼亞八　　來之要求、卽在衝突問題全部之研究、唯對于根據一九〇六年　條約之三強會議、聲明書中並未提及、顯由阿國猜疑此約所致、另據政府方面消息、阿國對于經濟讓與權、除先前所許者外、不能史有承認、至於政治七之讓步、則尤談不到到云、又此間有士耳其軍官一人、據謂已得其本國政府之許可、充任阿政府之軍事顧問、阿當局已接受云、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>日外務省否認　銷軍火與阿國</h3>
<p>（東京）外務省因倫敦電傳日本供給軍火於阿比西尼亞之消息、本日發表談話、闡明日本製造軍火情形、以免外間發生誤解、其談話內容如下、日政府從來不准人民私造軍火、凡出口軍火、由泰平組合、得政府許可後、始得運銷國外、最近泰平組合未曾請求政府發下武器出口之許可、故阿政府與日商訂立之軍火合同之說、毫無根據、查阿國情形、其由吉布提到阿京之鐵路在於法意兩國勢力下、故如無法意兩國之容許、在吉布提部下之軍火、運經阿京、事實上絕對辦不到也、（六日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外傳阿比西尼亞與日本軍火商訂簽合同收置軍火、或日本將派軍事顧問赴阿等說、然陸軍當局六日發表談話、否認此說日本民間有製造軍火工廠、然政府監督甚嚴、不得自由出賣國外、迄今為止、未有軍火商請求政府准許運銷軍火、外傳消息全非事實（六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>希臘克利特島　罷工亂事敉平　死三人傷三十七人</h3>
<p>雅典　政府已接克里特島巴柯波洛斯將軍來電、謂罷工者四千人、搶刦各行政機關後現秩序已復、渠率軍包圍康第亞、要求罷工者屈服時、罷工者卽悄然而散、渠曾接見罷工者之代表團、聆其陳述所求、於是彼等允服從當局、聞罷工者與軍警衝突之際、死三人、傷二十人、兵士亦傷十七人、亂事發作後、武裝警察卽馳往鎭壓、並宣布戒嚴令、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>雅典　克利特島之形勢突趨嚴重、政府機關停止辦公、希臘政府立卽派遣軍艦二艘赴出事地點恢復治安、並宣布戒嚴、據稱罷工者共四千人、與警察發生衝突時、工人方面共傷一百人、希臘艦隊現在雅典附近集中、生火待發、聞此次事變直接間接當與維尼瑞洛之勢力有關、維尼瑞洛係克利特人、其黨人爲促進彼等之政治目的起見、主張工人採取武力政策、因與工人聯合進攻市政廳而佔據之、聞克利特島防軍司令巴可博羅及警察總監謝都科均受重傷、希臘政府現信能在兩日內完全恢復治安、最後接到之報告稱、叛徒完全佔據根地亞鎭轟炸機五架現已奉令自雅典出動、如遇叛徒頑抗、决行轟炸、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）時報認克利特島之總罷工係一種政治上之新運動、叛徒會與政府軍衝突多次、佔據兵工廠、利用奪獲之軍械擊退軍隊、軍隊人數單薄、未能對數千叛徒抵抗、陸長龔地利斯。令撲滅叛亂、格殺勿論、雅典飛機塲多數防兵、自聞克利特島起事後、亦起叛變、經過猛烈之戰鬥後、始告平定、結果捕獲叛兵十五人、將受軍事法庭審理云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>雅典　此問今日宣布、康地亞之叛變、業已終止、罷工者已接受最後警告、無條件繳械解散、事前政府亦已接受罷工者之工資要求、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>希臘康地亞　克利特島今日因政治上之失意份子與勞動界之示威者聯合擾亂治安、已宣布戒嚴、政府並設法避免暴動、按克利特本有罷工運動、今年三月中擁護前總理維尼齊洛斯革命之殘餘份子、遂乘機與政府為難、率頒羣衆、闖入公共機關云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>雅典　外問盛傳政府擬將共和主義團體予以解散、此說業經官方否認、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>僞國與外蒙　交換代表問題　外蒙祗允處理邊境紛爭</h3>
<p>（長春）「滿國」外交啟接得外蒙方面關於處理滿蒙國境紛爭之答復後、六日聲明如下、七月二十九日外蒙方面對於滿方要求、巳有答復、提議代表之權能若限於處理國境之紛爭、且令代表駐在國培附近互相指定之地方、則交換代表並無異議云、該提議頗多曖昧與不合理之處、故五日在滿洲里之「滿國」代表提議容納外蒙方面代表權能限於處理國境紛爭之希望、並具體指示兩國駐在地點、且更須交換中央代表担任處理不能地方解决之事項、（六日電通電）</p>
<p>（長春）「滿國」於五日之滿洲里會議向外蒙提議之第三次要求、其要點在於兩國常設代表機關、分爲中央代表與地方代表、至於滿方具體細目之要求如下、</p>
<p>中央代表雖非全權公使或如大使之為正式兩國外交機關、但實質須為兩國政府之代表機關、常設於長春庫倫、處理兩國親善與外交交涉、（二）地方代表專任處理國境紛爭、常設於國境附近之二處、「滿國」代表駐外蒙、外蒙代表駐「滿國」擬根本解决從來兩國紛爭根源之國境間題、更進而期望恢復滿蒙兩國間之正常國交、（六日電通電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）庫倫來訊稱、七月十七日滿方復向蒙方提建議、七月二十九日桑布乃向滿國外交部代表干基提出蒙方之覆文、內稱前此蒙方曾建議設立常務聯合委員會、以公斷邊界糾紛、唯滿方於答覆時、卽提出最後通牒要求允許滿方代表駐居蒙境、其地點由滿方擇定、否則蒙古邊防軍隊、須一律撤退、此等要求自屬侵害蒙古主權、同時為直接侮辱、故蒙古對之拒絕接收、</p>
<p>蒙方承認、滿方於七月十七日所提建議中、巳不堅持單獨派遣代表之主張、而建議互換全權代表、蒙古方面為願恊助邊境和平起見、對於此項建議、認為如代表職權僅在解决邊境方面發生之問題、同時其所在地點乃由各該政府指定一位於邊境附近、俾於邊境糾紛重行發生之際、得為迅速積極之干涉、則並不反對、蒙方復以此項代表、以兼充邊境委員會內雙方主席代表為宜、按邊境委員會之設立、由蒙方建議、滿方並無反對云、（六日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>松岡今後任務　改組滿鐵對華謀經濟發展</h3>

<h3>閘北柳營路底　昨又發現火井　地下水管冒出烈焰火勢極猛　辛豐綢廠裝管利用改作燃爐</h3>
<p>——本市發現火井此已爲第六次</p>
<p>去歲本市台州會館內、曾發現一離奇之火井、旋於日前、滬西英美烟公司經理宅中、亦有火井爆裂、科學家認為此事實有研究價值、昨據大公社記者探得、閘北柳營路辛豐織綢廠內、現亦發現一火井、該社記者且於昨日下午、前往視察、茲誌經過如下、</p>
<p>發現火井閘北柳營路底之廉生絲廠、於去年閉歇、適值本市辛豐織綢廠營業擴充、有設印染部之必要、遂購得其地、翻造印花染廠、去年十二月間動工、開始卸拆、至最近工人於地下忽發現一自來水管、埋於地底、長達丈餘、管中冒出烈燄、且火勢熒熒、頗有不可嚮邇之勢、該廠員工無法樸滅、乃壓以泥土等物、火勢方熄、惟有時仍然穿出、烟火升騰、極為猛烈、</p>
<p>裝管利用此火井之發源地、適在該廠整理室旁、其上為第三工塲、廠中當局、因見此火井吐火不已、遂作廢物利用、將其地闢為顏料化騐室、而將此井接裝鉛管、直通地上、管之四週、平鋪以水門汀、僅使等首向上、改作燃爐、專供融化顏料之用、問亦煮飯烹飪、或燒茶水、其火力之強、與普通媒炭之力相等、</p>
<p>發火原因大公社記者昨特驅車赴該地觀察、該井居辛豐廠之邊側部分、其外則為一淤塞之小河、碧流潺潺、夕陽西下、錄蔭掩映、而附近居民、向以垃圾雜髒之物、投諸小河、因而河水混濁、臭氣四溢、詢諸廠中人云、其火井之下亦係垃圾、因井下之地、與此混濁小河相毘連、其垃圾量甚多、據地質學家稱、則謂該井發火之原因、卽係垃圾作用、因該井下旣多垃圾雜物、其中含有沼氣瓦斯、又經烈日之薰蒸、遂致發火云、</p>
<p>第六火井又探悉、上海之發現火井、已有六次、前三次在民八九年問、其地址與確時已不可考、第四次為去年在斜橋台州會館內、亦有一火井發現、迄今火勢尚未熄、現由租賃該地之某肥皂廠作為燃具、第五次卽上月底、在大西路英美烟公司經理宅內發現者、當時因火管爆裂、且有二工人死傷、第六次卽為本文所記之火井、上海之地質、是否有火、已成為一疑問、願科學家及地質學家研究之也、</p>

<p>任何人的錢，應該用在適當的地方，所謂適當的地方，可以決定一個人的吝卑和浪費。換句話說，以一文錢用在不適當的地方，這人是浪費的，不肯以全部財產用於最適當的地方，這人是吝嗇的，反過來說，不應該用錢的時候，我們要節省一文錢，應該用錢的時候，我們可以蕩盡全部的財富。</p>
<p>窮的人，因苦的人，往往容易成功他的事業，正象在烈火裏鍜出來的鐵，越是堅固。</p>
<p>所以要成功的人，不要嫌貧窮困苦，希望自己能忍耐這貧窮困苦。</p>
<h3>讖兆奇聞</h3>
<p>— 林佚談</p>
<p>大凡一個人有意外不幸的事變發生以後，在回憶着這事變未發生以前的事情，都覺得有讖兆在預先警示着，可是却沒有人能夠在事先猜詳得出，都是在事後才恍然大悟，這可以算是莫明其妙的一個值得研究的問題，下面這故事便是帶這種性質的。</p>
<p>同族某，雄於資，爲福州金融界的巨擘，有一次，他在福州很著名的一個詩社裏，關吟着「相」「鄉」的第三唱折枝吟，（折枝吟在福州是很普遍的，因爲愛好詩學的人，比較多一點）這位我的同族，他做一首：「盜如相識適勿失，妓是鄕親認不妨」的句子，這道人所不能道的句子，當然是「榆元」了。可是奇特就在詩句裏，也就是讖兆的可異處。</p>
<p>過兩天，他同他的家人，坐一部汽車到郊外去兜風，汽車駛到離城很遠的地方時，那時是黃錯，四望都是麥疇，忽然擁出四五個綁票，先朝天開槍，然後截住汽車，單單綁刦他去。到匪窟裏，他才知道綁票中有一個是他辭去的舊當差，因爲知道他有錢，所以特地偵查他的遊踪而實行綁架。</p>
<p>還有一件可怪的事，便是他到匪窟的時候，已經先有一個女人在那裏，這女人不是別人，便是跟他相好的福州挺有名的姑娘，因爲伊挺有名的緣故，所以也被綁匪光領一下。他倆在匪窟裏，同受患難，感情當然也增進了許多。</p>
<p>以後他贖回來，花去兩萬多，出來之後，他說出這讖兆的奇事，在福州很多人傳誦面轟動一時的。</p>
<h3>英姑</h3>
<p>— 陳秋農</p>
<p>在　興路永興路口的一塊極大的荒塲上，有不少賣技的，每天在那裏表演種種遊藝，有京戲，有馬戲，還有各種灘簧和獨腳戲，滑稽戲，雙簧，說書，楊州戲，紹興戲，國術團，魔術等等。也好似一個露天的大世界，每天看客，人山人海，倒也不少，一般做小生意的，爭先恐後，也到這裏去設攤營業。</p>
<p>英姑是一個表演武術兼唱小曲的女子，每天也在這裏　歌賣技，她這一班裏共人男女藝員十多人，因爲英姑生得最漂亮，所以就算是這一班裏的檯柱子，十幾個人都靠着伊一人的珠喉玉貌度生活。</p>
<p>這天午後，各種遊藝不約而同一齊開始表演了，英姑的塲子同時也敲着開塲鑼鼓，不多一會工夫，看客已經圍滿了各個塲子，每天除了馬戲塲以外，終是英姑的塲子最興。</p>
<p>這時英姑已開始表演了，另外一個女藝員朝天的臥在一隻方桌子上，兩腳朝天豎起，英姑上去盤坐在這兩隻腳底朝天的腳上，說了幾句開塲白，接着就唱起那「伸手摸到……」的十八摸，四圍的看客，個個向伊呆視著。</p>
<p>十八摸快唱完了，旁邊的幾個藝員，正預備要向四圍的看客索錢，以供十幾個同伴的夜餐資，忽然從人叢中走出了一個警察，上前喚伊下來，並且這樣的說着，「這小調有關風化，拖你局裏去罰錢，」</p>
<p>英姑雖然是一個會武技的女子，至少有七八個警察的抗力，但是終不敢冒犯他，結果收塲不唱了事。</p>
<p>這夜十幾人的五臓殿裏，都受了這位警察先生的影響，有的拉着回聲，有的放着汽筒，閙個通宵不休。</p>
<h3>避暑兩重天</h3>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>月英皺了眉道：賈老爺出去的時候，他還要把門鎖起來呢。我說，若把我鎖在屋子裏，倒好像是怕我逃跑，讓別人看到了，我多難爲情。他想了一想，才讓我關着門在屋裏坐，有朋友來，只說他出去了，不必開門。你來了，是女人，我才敢放你進來。請坐罷，有什麼事嗎？說着，也知道倒一杯茶，放到桌上待客。浣花見他坐在床上，也就挨着他坐下，摸了他一隻手到懷裏，輕輕的撫摸着道：妹妹，你說實心話，你這樣嫁了人，你覺得很好嗎？月英猛然的看了他一眼，好像是想不到他會說這句話，說道：那不用得問嗎？我現在不餓肚子了，衣服也有得穿。浣花依然握住他的手，更注視到他的臉上。覺得他臉皮子繃得緊緊地，並不曾帶着笑容，於是將手按了他的肩膀道：我說謊話呢。我看你的樣子，並不怎樣的高興呀。月英低了頭，自看着自己的手，却沒有答復。浣花道：囉！我說怎麼樣？心裏又難過起來了不是？月英又抬頭看了他一眼，才低聲答道：我也沒有別的事心裏難過，就是看不着我的娘，也看不到我的奶奶。浣花道：賈先生不許你回去，難道你家裏人，也不能來看你嗎？（二八三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「做父親的往往要揮着老淚，向他們的兒女們說道：我如今沒奈何而打你們一下，但我自己却比受了十下還痛苦；我如果打你們十下，便等於打我自己一百下。你們的痛苦是在身上，我的痛苦却在心裏！」現在我把這一個久立朝班的大臣，這樣的處罰了，我自己心內所感到的痛苦，真也不輸如他所感到的咧！」</p>
<p>「然而事情已是這樣了，我們必須趕快找些旁的事情來做，才好使我們把這些煩惱驅逐開去；要是不然的話，我們怎麼能把這件事忘掉呢？但是我們真有非把它忘掉不可的必要，因爲我們的朝臣太多了，以後怎會沒有人再犯罪；有人犯了罪，當然又不免要處罰，假使一次一次的煩惱堆積起來，豈不要積得太多了？我們這樣身子不好的人，那裏禁受得起？弄得不好，給他們氣死了怕還不夠！但有什麼用呢」？</p>
<p>從太后上面這兩段談話上看來，伊老人家也還不無幾分能夠辨別是非的心；伊把那位廣東巡撫所幹的事也確認爲非，可見伊尚不是全不辨黑白的人。據我平日留心體察，伊不但對於人家幹錯的事瞧得很清楚，便是伊自己有了什麼錯誤，也很能警覺，而且從不故意的文飾，每能很坦白地承認；當然伊老人家是絕對不會因幹錯了什麼而受人責罰，或自去向人道歉的。（三八三）</p>
<h3>尤尢之又一說</h3>
<p>— 紅羊</p>
<p>本春秋因了怪姓稿所引起的有點之尤，無點之尢的辯正。現在無錫尤公簡公後裔，方在修譜，同了蘇州的尢姓聯宗，在尤文簡公的手札之內，可以知道當時的尤姓，是有一點的尤，但是蘇州姓尢的兩處大族，劉家浜和鳳凰街，都是沒有一點，因此可以分出無錫是尤姓，蘇州却是尢姓，於是有了以下的考究。</p>
<p>據考古家說，蘇州尢的一系，是明朝方孝孺的後代，在明成祖誅戮方孝孺十族的時候，方孝孺有一個小兒子，逃出天羅地綱，沒有罹難，逃到了蘇州，便易姓爲田，田字的形狀，是四角方方，易姓爲田，實際上便以字形爲姓，不廢方姓的紀念，到了後來。從田而改姓爲尢，所以蘇州尢姓的一系，是方孝孺的後代，從方姓改田姓，再由田姓而成了尢姓的。</p>
<p>這一種的傳說，雖是有些像虛無縹渺，但是考查蘇詶尢姓的宗族，在七八代前，却有姓田的說素，以後便姓了無點的尢，這般一說，蘇州尢是方孝孺子孫改姓，可以有幾分實在了，或者所以把尤姓去了一點，是因了別於真的尤姓而來，也能使人相信，不過後來從田而改尢的緣因，却不可考了。</p>
<p>現在無錫尤文簡公的後裔，正在修譜，蘇州尢姓，雖是少了一點，又有方孝孺後代，是由田而成尢的傳說，但是既改姓了尢，自然同尤姓大有關係，不然爲什麼不性了趙錢孫李，而必定要姓尢而去掉一點呢，當然同尤姓有絕大的關係了，聯爲一宗，自未爲不可啊！</p>
<p>遊踪所至</p>
<h3>超山夏夜</h3>
<p>— 汪放庵</p>
<p>山中最好避暑。觀夫匡廬莫干天上黃山諸峯近時之裙履雲集者，此語洵不處也。二三年前，寄跡杭州，偵盛暑必涉足湖濱迎涼，而尤以夏夜例必往，往則非遲至月落星稀不歸寓。每於燈月交輝中，眺湖心，遠望湖上羣山，輒覺悠然神往。恨嘆勞縣伴，不追入深山也！自賦閒回鄕，蓬門久閉，日車米鹽，久不作怡情悅性之想，近又困暑，家居湫溢，悶人欲死，遂興遐思。幾度擬作汗漫遊，終違所願。轉念　鄕，豈無佳山水哉？因於月之某日，隻身入超山，訪蜜音上人，宿於報慈寺。</p>
<p>超山爾時以看梅着聞於　，其聲譽且駕鄧尉孤嶼血上之。然山中並多蒼松翠竹，亦宜消夏，比景則看梅人或未能領略一二也。山中每遇梅花開後；遊人已漸冷落　，至盛夏吏鮮人跡，尤適　靜。自塵囂中來此，真覺別有田地！予既隻身來，而留於報慈寺亦僅蜜音上人隻身，寺傭以農忙，均上山插秧去。四山靜寂，誠若置身於上丈紅塵之外矣。</p>
<p>予入山時，方清晨。蜜音上人與予業欵洽，嘗不拘形跡共遊處。即就其禪室據蒲團作清談，苦若綸心，尤饒興趣。旣餐，則聞蔬野筍，紫茄綠荳，益以寺中精製之素火腿熏皮等，佐以玫瑰家釀，餘雖不善飲，亦盡兩盞，雖未嘗健飯，亦啖三盂，田家風味，蓋於寺中香積廚下，備嘗之矣，入午，蟬鳴樹巔，聞高唱入雲之曲，稍破岑寂，竟不嫌其煩，然非山中，不能有此心境也。</p>
<p>是日旣夕，松風謖謖，如怒濤奔騰，暑氛人消，涼生枕簞，頗似瓊樓玉宇，高處不勝寒也！偶探首窗外窺中天月色，又如水銀瀉地，遠囑獅峯，高與天接，背廠馬鞍，恍若烟籠美人，超山夏夜之勝，真苦於無彩筆爲之一一形容耳！</p>
<p>予入山後，計留者三日夜，日惟高臥南牕，靜挹奪風，夢遊黑甜之鄕，聽流泉聲淙淙到枕，爲我滌藎煩襟，每入夜，則或於豆棚瓜架之下，邀一二鄕農閒話桑麻。或偕上人趨杭塘汽車路，過白粟山橋，俯視清流，就水掬月，或且泛小舟，容與水中央，任輕波送盪，且山中多寺，以上人故，每過從，亦備受優遇，因或登馬鳴寺遠眺塘棲夜市，或入化城庵摩趙松雪古跡井欄題字，或坐古觀音庵聽松濤，或造泗水庵汲天然泉水煮苦茗，而報慈寺內，且多一蒲團一經卷供我消遣之需，此情此景，不知嗜山水有癖者，當茲溽暑薰人之際，其亦神往否耶？</p>
<p>予於十七年前，亦嘗興亡弟車行辟暑山居，其時蹴居於馬鞍山麓之大圓寺，蜜音上人，方爲寺住持，故甚歡洽，寺距超山不里許，而報慈寺則尚在荒烟蔓草間，若夷光之粟往苧蘿時也，及今思之，自重行窠世已十七年矣，人事變幻，不可紀極，豈特滄海桑田之感哉？</p>

<h3>小男兒（七）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著　鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>小規第將瓶送到時，因為太過賣力·兩臉童至發紅，所以等到乃德勇敢地吃了一服以後，裴夫人也許他一舐那個羹匙，並且拿塊法蘭絨，帮助乃德把頸頸的四周暖暖圍住。</p>
<p>〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>這些治療的初步還未完全做了，忽然發見，一陣鐘聲，又一陣熱鬧的脚步經過那個樓梯間裏，才知道已是晚餐的時間了。怕羞的乃德想這一趟要去見到許多陌生的童子，竟至戰抖起來，可是裴夫人伸出一隻手給他，羅勃並以庇護者的神氣說道，「不要怕；我會照應你的」。</p>
<p>十二個男孩子，每行六個，各自立在椅子的背後，一跳一跳恨不得立時動手，而那個高高的弄簫的靑年，正在設法想有以稍减他們的熱烈。却也沒有人隨便坐下來，直到裝夫人在大茶壺背後就坐以後，她指着在她右手的乃德，介紹給大家道。。</p>
<p>「這是我們的新孩子，白乃德。吃過晚飯，你們可以招呼一下。文靜些，孩子們，文靜些。」</p>
<p>她說請時，人人都凝視着乃德，然後都溜進他們的座位裏，也想要斯斯文文，然而結果適得其反。裴氏夫婦盡他們的力量想使童子們在用膳的時候能够好好的，平常却也尚有成績，因為他們的規條旣單簡而又合理，並且實子們，知道他們倆是在輔助他們，是在求他們的幸福，也是盡力服從的。但有時那如飢似渴的童子們也有非用威力不能抑制的趨勢，星期六的晚間在半天休假以後便是一個好例。</p>

<h3>性與藝術</h3>
<p>— 程學鴻</p>
<p>有島武郎說：「產生藝術的是愛。」不錯，愛的激流才能美化了這世界。人們發現了美，即將此美的印象，組成一理想中的美，以為表識；藝術品的產生，就在這時候。</p>
<p>從歷史上看，藝術的發十軔，是起源於野蠻民族的漫畫，衣飾，以及文身等裝飾，據葛洛斯（Grooes）說；澳大利亞的土人，每遇外出，輙携一袋，內藏紅黃白三種顏料，平日在頰上敷設數點，引以為榮，戰時，身體四周塗染諸色，用以懼敵。陽春佳節，或凱旋慶功時，必於全身着上色彩，以邀女性之垂靑；無論戰爭或求愛均宜紅色，故其價值最高。因此部落中有因欲得此紅色之供給，奮力與人相爭，至延長數星期之久。男子與女于相較，男子的着色，更甚於女子；有些部落，絕對禁止未婚婦女，在頭上着色。</p>
<p>在澳洲的夜舞會中，跳舞者經常差不多都是用白色的塗彩，在Palti舞中，則兼用赤白二色。拿林伊利族（Marrinyeri）有以大紅色的礦土來裝飾死者的屍體。總之，原始時代的身體塗彩的唯一目的是為了求美。</p>
<p>用顏料來塗身有一個很大的缺點，就是易於退去，於是野蠻部落，努力尋求永存的藝術，加以美感形態的製作，藉以增加牠的價值。</p>
<p>文身是一種最普遍的方法；以燧石，貝殼或其他原始式的小刀，刺破皮膚，使成花紋，再埋置色素於其下，使其經久不退。澳洲有些部落，刺創是以施在背上為主，而其他則或在腕際，或在胸部，腹部，腿部都有。這種手續是同時施用在兩性之間的，但男子的刺創，往往比婦女的切劃多一些。刺創的式樣有斑點，曲綫和直綫種種的不同，有時在整個胸部，都施以割劃（可參“Natural　History　of　Man”by　Wood）。桃爾斯（Torres）海峽一帶的土人，男子在兩肩都刺有很厚的馬蹄形的創痕，有如軍人佩動章的樣子；這全是最慘酷的原始藝術。</p>
<p>衣服的殺初與其說牠為實用，母寗說牠為裝飾來得確切些。當達爾文見一個將要凍斃的富吉安（Fuegian）土人而把一件紅色衣服給他的時候，土人即喜形於色，把牠撕為長條，分贈同伴，當作裝飾圍繞在他們寒慄的腿上，使達爾文發生意外的驚奇。其實，和現在二十世紀的摩登女子，雖嚴冬亦必露胸襟御絲襪的求美心理是一樣的。</p>
<p>在北極地帶的愛斯基摩人（Askimo），也沒有忘記裝飾，他們在皮製的衣件上縫着各色細碎的皮條，齒骨，金屬的珠玉，銅鈴等等。婦女對於衣服上的裝飾和男子一樣的複雜，且進而飾着一種下垂到膝部的腰衣（背後的一種下垂物），藉以表示她們和男子間的區別。</p>
<p>那些文明史家們專致力於這種有興致的工作，以平易的科學方法，闡明我們在文化上的建術對於各種狀態的文明民族是如何的偉大；他們通常是把這種衣着和裝飾之不均勻當作是那些不能不必要與必要之間分別輕重的野蠻人的幼稚純樓之有趣味的例子。</p>
<p>原始人對於身體方面，旣有相當的裝飾，於是進而及於用具。不論兵器上及一切日用石器上省塗染顏色，並將渴望捕獲的野獸，或己族共同膜拜的圖騰（Totem）刻諸窟壁，以示美觀。</p>
<p>建築起源於墳墓。世界最古的建築物，埃及的金字塔，即係墳墓。最初的禮拜堂，是死者的神龕，生者即在神龕前，敬禮死者。後來墓穴部份，漸遷移到附近處所，但如有名的威斯脫密尼斯脫寺院（Westminister　Abbey），祖先墳墓，仍埋於寺院中，此簡單寺院，實為後世希臘人為Pallas　Athene）以及衆神設立廟宇的開端亦為後世嘎特式寺院（GothicCathedras）的雛形，在此類寺院中，築有祭壇，為陳列死者遺物之聖地，其意義實與最初的墳墓相類。</p>
<p>不但宗教的藝術，必須在戀愛中吸取活的泉源用以滋養其生命；其他各創造藝術的要素，亦同樣須與戀愛相結合。節奏之美，與戀愛連絡，方能產生舞蹈，詩歌，音樂。</p>
<p>原始的舞蹈是原始之美的感情中最直接，最完全，和最有力的表現。在舞蹈中，原始人無疑地見到他們所能普遍感受的最強烈的美的享樂。也就是說，舞蹈可以賜予性的滿足。狩獵民族的舞蹈通常單中男子們演奏，而婦女們只是作音樂的伴奏。可是也有男女共同參加，而這種舞蹈無疑妳是想激勵性的愁望。</p>
<p>詩歌是為達到某種美的目的而有的美底效果之形式所表示的內界或外界現象之言語上的表現。這個定義，是包括表現內界現象—主觀的感情和觀念—的主觀底詩即抒情詩，和叙事底及戲曲的形式上表示外界的現象——客觀的事實和事件—的客觀底詩。不論在任何塲合，其表現單從事於美的目的，即是詩人並不是想到刺激行為，而是要訴諸感情。格雷（Grey）說：「老年的澳洲人，唱歌簡直當作家常便飯。怒也歌，喜也歌，飢也歌，如果喝酒—倘若沒有到爛醉失了知覺的時候—更外唱得厲害。」</p>
<p>音樂在諸藝術中之性與影響上，是站在無與比倫的地位，而形成其本身獨立的一種藝術。一切其他藝術不得不用為生活的目的；而昔樂却全然只用為藝術的目的。日本久保田万太郎說得好：「詩人像個孩子。」在這個意義中，音樂可以稱為最純粹的藝術。特別是在音樂與詩之間，雖然牠他外表上有密切的聯繫，但是在這兩者中存在了極深的內部矛盾。詩，支配着全現象世界；而着樂自身可以說：「我的王國不在這個世界裏，」（My　kingdom　is　not　of　this　world）。</p>
<p>潛伏着的性的泉源，可以滋養藝術家創作慾，有時性愛與藝術同時產生。浪漫派的天才家就是這樣產生，這般天才家，想像力戰勝了理智，性愛與藝術同時侵蝕了他們。因為慾望的急流，頻頻衝動着，他們善感，熱情，專事幻想，毫無節制；他們的創痛，亦永無窮盡。他們所走的，都是極端的路。惟有創造詩歌，繪畫，音樂，及一切戀愛哲學；向他們追隨而表同情。同時人類的所以能得綿延不絕，生命的所以能永存不朽，統靠着這創造的大力。</p>
<p>「藝術科學必須從原始民族之原始藝術開始。」我相信這句人類學者的標語。</p>
<h3>高人雅事—臨流賦詩</h3>
<p>— 胡考</p>
<h3>大學時代（三九）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>我環繞子周圍，走到那個地球塲，就在那裏等她。不久我就看見白衣服底閃光和這姑娘底輕步聲音，接着她就喘息未定地站在我面前了。——現在我又同她，在夏夜黑暗中，孤獨地在一塊兒；但這是另外一種情景了。我還未曾對她說話，她早從袋裏拿出一卷紙頭；比時又有電光一閃，我就看出這是一封信，信上郵票和火漆也看得出來。「這是克里斯多夫寫來的，」娜麗說，當我不由己意地伸手也去時候，她就把這封信放在我手中。</p>
<p>「克里斯多夫寫來的」！我喊，「您甚麽時候收到這封信」？</p>
<p>「今天」！她輕輕回答。</p>
<p>「那麼您還是跑到這裏來」？</p>
<p>她不響。</p>
<p>「我可以看這封信麽，娜麗」？</p>
<p>「我正要請您看的。」</p>
<p>我走到屋子背後一個有燈光的窗戶旁邊。麗慢慢地隨我走來；我感覺，當我看信時候，她的眼睛沒有離開過我。</p>
<p>這是一封長信。克里斯多夫解釋他好久沒有寫信來的緣故。他把舅父底生意拿過手來；但他對這生意的關係還在動搖不定當中，因為一切事情都要看表姊能否同一個有錢的掃烟囱師傳結婚來决定的：當一個做裁縫匠的同鄉來探訪他時候，他巳經忙着製造新房傢俱了，但是婚事忽然變了卦；現在一切事情終於完全要妥貼了，表姊巳經結了婚，而他幾日後也就可以在外邦獲得了師傳資格；所以現在邀請她自己到那裏去，因為無暇抽身到這裏來接她去。「　一經接到你的回信」，信中最後一段說，「立刻就把路費寄來；這筆路費巳經籌出來並另　存放着。屋子，你是容易尋到的；在門前綠色板橙旁邊有一株菩提樹，像從前你父母底家裏一樣；我自己為這一對靑年師傳和師娘佈置的房子，就完全在這菩提樹遮蔭底下。」！</p>
<p>我把信摺疊起來，拿還她。但娜麗搖搖頭。「請您寫信給他吧，菲力先生！」她說，兩行眼淚流到她的腮邊；她又低聲添上一句說：「他的盛意是很可感激的。」</p>
<p>「那麽您不願意自己去麽？」我問。</p>
<p>她看我，帶着一種哀求的絕望的眼光，使得我懊悔不應當問她這句話。</p>
<p>「娜麗，」我說，「有人可以帮你忙麽？」</p>
<h3>我們那河堤潰决了（下）</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>「我看這樣子不穩固」，一個靑年這樣說。</p>
<p>「不穩固？誰在說話呀」！去年車水給我打壞了腿的老八停止了手上的鋤頭，呌着。</p>
<p>「我說的一。那靑年挺起胸來，對着他。「大家看呵，這樣子只是挖了沒貼上去，為什麽還要我們的修堤費？那些錢用到什麼地方去了？我們的工是白做的呀」！</p>
<p>「是呵，我們問黃太爺去」！</p>
<p>「那傢伙在放屁」，老八衝了前來，喊着。</p>
<p>「你怎麼，老八」？靑年迎上去，「你也是老百姓，在堤的後頭也有你的妻子和孩子們；萬一堤不穩固决了，你不會受到損失嗎」？</p>
<p>「你說得好漂亮！那末黃太爺的家就不在堤後麽？他就希望水淹到他那大屋中去？他的家產…」</p>
<p>「他的家產在上海咧，知道麽」？那小伙子怪沉着地回答他，微笑着。「大家不記得嗎，遇到一點風聲不好他就先逃去啦！受罪的到底是誰呵！是誰呵！」</p>
<p>「對啦！是誰呵」！我向那臉在發靑的老八板着臉椰揄了一句，覺得痛快得多了。</p>
<p>工程師趕上來吆喝着了。我們大家就一齊停了工作向他賣問着，要他把堤做得堅固些。他就回到黃太爺那裏去商量；過後就每六有縣裏特送下鄉來的武裝士兵監視着大家了……</p>
<p>「河堤果然並沒有修得十分堅固」，說故事的人繼被着，而且也漸漸說到項點了，他就用手勢來帮助了他的表情。夏天又下了一連半個月的雨，河的上游就把水往下冲。我們去視察了一下提岸，天，已經到了很危急的狀態中了。黃太爺呢，他不管你們怎樣發急，他說正在寫呈文到上峯去，等救濟的欵寄到了——可是過了兩天他却偷偷地溜到縣城去，領了欵走了」！</p>
<p>「眞的這樣可惡嗎」？有人憤慨地問。</p>
<p>「那里不是眞的呢，過後黃家速長工都跟着走啦。」他也表示憤恨了。「我回到家里只是搔着頭髮，對着老婆不知道怎麽好。六十歲的媽媽病在床上，如果我們那河堤潰决了，那可實在——有一天晚上，夜是靜穆得一點聲息也沒有，雨也晴了；可是躺在床上却整夜的睡不着，心在發狂似地跳。河堤邊有人在監視；而我却幾次似乎聽到遠遠地敲起鐘聲，猛地爬了起身，嚇得她面無人色。「沒有鑼聲：什麽聲音池沒有，你靜靜地睡覺吧』。可是我那里睡得着啊」。</p>
<p>「那末你們那河堤到底怎麼樣了」？</p>
<p>「潰决了——半夜里眞的有鑼聲悽悲而危急地警告着水已經冲破了堤岸，向着村里盪來了。人聲一時嘈雜起來，混若孩子們的哭泣，一時整個村子都陷到極度恐怖之中了。我和老婆趕緊爬起來去扶着媽媽，而且還要在背上負着大包袱，一口氣奔了出來。外邊到處有火炬，還有無數的人影向南移動。我們便這樣掙扎着出了險……」</p>
<p>「你的媽媽呢」？</p>
<p>「在路上死了」。他太息起來，說道。「你想吧，一個六十歲的老太婆，本來是病倒在床上的了，遇到水的襲逼，一面掛念着家的被淹沒，一面奔波怎麽不…不…」</p>
<p>一粒懷念家裏和母親的眼淚滴下來了，說故事的人停止了他的說話。他是千辛萬苦逃到這里找他的表哥來的；但是表哥是一個紗廠的工人，一間茅屋租十四塊錢——說不定要打折扣的薪水將怎樣維持他們的生活？於是他兩隻手托着沉重的頭，沉默地坐在悶熱的夏天的街上，咬聚牙根，想起那河提潰决的事實，他只有浩嘆了。</p>
<h3>百本張大鼓書目</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>最近看到日本書誌學會的「書誌學」四卷四號，裏面有一篇長澤規矩也的「家藏舊鈔曲本目錄」，其中有百本張堂最初出版的大鼓書鈔本五十三冊的目錄，都是「百本張書目」中所曾著錄的·案，百本張開設於乾隆年間，這最初的書目代表了乾隆時代所流行的大鼓，有很多是現在已經不易見到的了。至少、下列一些種，都不大流行；或者更準確一點說，我個人不曾見過：</p>
<p>百山名　百鳥名兒　一百黑　十重恩　蒙正趕齋　蒙正祭灶　十三月古人名　十二月古人名聯陞三級（兩本）　劉高手探病　門神皂王訴功　目蓮僧救母　戲班名　九九圖古人名　漁翁得利　最喜春光　勸世文　小漢子鋤地　二八佳人　「一朶浮雲鋪滿天」　一品當朝　十五拆　伶俐的小妞妞　顛倒古人名　三月桃花十陸靠　遇僧　十至百觀花　海棠開花　姑嫂降香　六月三伏　八難　彩樓配</p>
<p>以上二十四本顯然地有一個特點，就是極少採用歷史上的題林只有「蒙正趕齋」「蒙正祭灶」「目蓮僧救母」「彩樓配」「劉高手探病」是根據民間所流行的古老故事的。這與淸光緒以後盛行「三國」「水滸」「紅樓」的大鼓，實是大異其趣。說不定當時大鼓還不曾佔得舞台的地位，只是「走街坊」，唱些後來所，謂「文明小曲」罷了。其餘十九本現在還有鉛印的刋本流傳着，謹抄列於後，並註出所見何書，及其出版處：</p>
<p>以下見「文明大鼓書詞」，北平中華印刷局刋行，共二十五冊。各本見於何冊均於題下註明：</p>
<p>（一）羅成算卦（第八冊）　（二）羅成托蘿（第十七冊）</p>
<p>（三）長板坡兩本（第十五冊）　（四）十愛誇夫（第五冊）</p>
<p>（五）大雜會（第四冊）　（六）包公誇桑（第五冊）</p>
<p>（七）韓信問卜（第五冊，惟題作「韓信算卦」）</p>
<p>（八）八仙（第十二冊，惟題作八仙慶壽，不知是否）。</p>
<p>大雜會和十愛誇夫另有北平寶文堂小薄本。以下均見寶文堂本：</p>
<p>（九）百花名兒（無兒字）　（十）百蟲名兒（無兒字）</p>
<p>（十一）靑菜名兒（無兒字）（十二）酒色財氣</p>
<p>（十三）至拾倒翻　（十四）遠觀靑山一片石</p>
<p>（十五）初一十五廟門開　（十六）蝍蟟算卦</p>
<p>（十七）佳人戲鸚鵡</p>
<p>最後五冊須略加說明。蝍燎算卦作螞蚱算命，一至拾倒翻作十字倒捲簾，佳人戲鸚鵡作鸚哥對詩，不知是一是二。「遠觀靑山一片石」是「嫌貧愛富」（岔曲）的首句，「初一十五廟門開」是「妓女告狀」的首句。</p>
<p>希望這一篇短文對於大鼓的史的發展之探討，能够有一點用處。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>自殺種種</h3>
<p>— 家為</p>
<p>關於自殺風氣的長成，原不是今日起。隻身的，雙雙的，闔家的，集團的；而方法有自刎，服毒，投河，跳樓…等等，都是活生生地直接去消滅自己的生命，毀隳自己的生存機能。這是一件何等殘酷而不人道的事。</p>
<p>所以自殺一開頭，就引起社會人士的注意，偉論，高見，箴言，防止方法，大家都已經熱烈地討論，而且，據報載云；「年來社會經濟枯竭，失業日衆，自殺事件，日有發生……設法防止，實屬切要。市公安局有鑒於此，故特飭科繪具關於描寫自殺之痛苦種種警惕圖畫，製成巨幅數十帙，以備遍釘於市區內各馬路里港公共塲所及碼頭河岸橋樑顯明之處，俾對一時消極而自殺之市民，加以警惕。」此後，我們相信，在這樣觸目驚心的「回頭是岸」式的巨幅圖畫之下，「或可」將半月要有五十四起的自殺事件打一個大折扣。惟以後的效果，究屬怎樣，只有待事實來證明。</p>
<p>不過，所謂「自殺」，一般地說來，只是指着積極方面而說的——直接摧殘自己的生存機能；間接使人驚心動魄，目不忍覩。可是，除此之外，正有着別種的「自殺」方法甚多，不過，不大會引人注意罷了。這種方法，可名之為「消極自殺」和「慢性自殺」。</p>
<p>所謂「做一日和尚撞一日鐘」的「人生哲學」，在今日的社會中，原是比此皆是。而且，更有懷着專坐「苦齋」，吃「淸茶」而「談狐說鬼」的「處世藝術」，也正大有人在。在這里，他們是顯得「淸高」，「風雅」，以至像看破了「紅塵」的和尚，尼姑投入了「空門」。然而，要是嚴格的說來，在這種「得過且過」的生活狀態之下，他們正等待着最後一日運命的降臨，也是自殺。</p>
<p>至於一般青年人，路進了社會，遇到了殘酷的現實，而碰壁失敗，失意，就此灰心，傷感，頺廢……雖然全心他們不「遽萌厭世之念」，却也就此要爲之神經錯亂而反常起來。也是自殺，有的去過他們悲世孤零的生活，有的進那紙迷金醉的塲所去過他們頺廢的生活，以消磨他們的青春，摧殘他們的生命。所謂「悲觀文義」者，或「快樂文義」者，以至「全運論」者等，都可以歸納到自殺的一流。</p>
<p>至於在大的方面，更有在國難日亟時，以「娛樂不忘救國」而高唱「跳舞救國」等待，也正可說得是這一部門的演出者。</p>
<p>而且，瘋人院里要鬧客滿；青年人十之八九會面黃飢瘦，神經衰弱，以至肺患第×期等，何嘗不能說與這里是着直接的關係呢？</p>
<p>不過，這也並不是偶然的，在今日這個蕭瑟潦倒的社會中，只有養成嗄慢性自殺」，或「消極自殺」的演出，在「積極自殺」方面，現在已經有「消極防止方法」來「救濟」。不知這種「消極自殺」將用什麽「方法」來挽救他們。</p>
<h3>夏夜的海灣</h3>
<p>— 奕</p>
<p>寒暑表漲到了九十餘度上，都市里到處就好似一個大火爐的噴出着熱烘烘地悶氣。太陽整天好像呆滯不動的晒着土地，天空沒有一絲兒風，白雲也一點沒有動的停留在天的邊綫上。在這樣的熱天底下，馬路上的柏油在溶化着的飛出白烟，樹葉死寂的睡着，一個行人走過，好似落湯鷄的淋着汗，狗也疲倦地躺在樹陰下伸長着舌頭，肚皮不住的漲縮着地喘息。</p>
<p>室里，牆壁是熱的，地板上，一切的東西都吐出着熱的氣。生活在里面的人，就像是鴨子放進爐里去烤樣的滴出油汁來。講禮貌，欲廉恥的人類，男的女的，在這樣的氣候之下，似乎忘去了禮貌和廉恥，擺脫去了衣冠動物的本性，個個是坦着胸和背露着臂和腿。假如社會是一切自由的，回歸自然是人人歡喜的。蓋在肉體上的稀薄短小的織物」雖都感到好似負着千斤的重擔。</p>
<p>依山旁水的日港，雖然沒有北方都市里夏天的炎熱，但熱天的長久，是使人感到憂鬱和苦悶，這好似北方冬天的長久，使人感到嚴冷的可怕是一樣的。所以，生活在這樣的熱天的島市的人們，除了一羣終年與冷熱抗戰的為生活而生活的人們之外，誰都在這樣的熟氣烘烘地時間中，尋求着種種地舒適的，凉爽的，解除悶氣的生活方式。</p>
<p>有閒的人是聰明的，快樂的。在白天，雖然炎熱會使他她們也喘息，流汗。但嘗在夕陽西下，西方天際還是一片紅霞照耀着的時候，他她們巳經是走上了快樂的規地了。</p>
<p>深藍色的海灣，水是沒有一點波浪的靜穆着，偶然地一隻輪船開進港里來，那船屁股上拖延着的浪花，在紅霞的光耀中，就好似是拉着一條赤色的金練。被太陽晒熱了的水，溫度也漸漸地降低了；輕微地海風從遠方吹來，就像自由神的給與人們打斷了枷拷般的使人舒適的陶醉。</p>
<p>在皇后碼頭四週環繞着的無數地小汽船，櫓秀船，一隻隻地裝上了年靑的女人與男人向着廣闊的海灣上泊去。都市似乎是這般人的賓庫，一羣過了又是一羣的從四方八面吐到碼頭上來，而文被小船搬在海面上。一陣陣地粉香和笑語，就漂蕩在整個的海彎上。</p>
<p>過海輪上，這時也開始的熱鬧起來，一種白天所不會看見的男人的歡樂女人的笑臉，在這時是到處的流溢出來。機輪的濃濁的聲嚮，似乎打不斷他她們的密語，一切情愛的心情，似乎經過了一日的苦悶而在這大自然之下就傾吐不盡了。</p>
<p>天空上的繁星，一點點地閃灼着，好似與人們一樣的感到白天的苦悶而在夜空上更明亮地輝耀。島市上的一綫長蛇環於山邊的建築，到處都在閃着五光十色的明燈，在那燈影里，人們也像海上的人們一樣的過着短促的夜的快樂地生活。黑暗的海面，也給那穿流着的小</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>船中的罣罣魚燈似的光照亮了。</p>
<p>都市，夏夜的南國的都市，是歡樂的，光明的，另一率人的快樂的土地。世界上的一切，是盡歸他她們所有了。</p>
<h3>印子老大</h3>
<p>— 克明</p>
<p>－今人物行述</p>
<p>黃昏的時侯，因為熱，人家全把晚飯搬到外面來吃。於是，在這灰暗的天空下面，在這炎熱的空氣中（充滿了汗的氣味，談話的喧嘈，與小孩子們的號哭的），小弄是頓然地振起了一天來疲乏的臉，而露出了另一種嘈雜的神情來了！人們在做工的，在商店裏做跑腿的，在鬧街上做小本買賣的，在一天的勞作以後，全靠着這麽一個時候，在沒有把自己的疲乏的身軀放到狹小而多臭蟲的床鋪上去以前，在鄰人的點頭招呼中，在女人孩子的吵鬧中，談點閑話，談點生活上的正經，談點猥褻的每天在都會中串演着的故事，也談點「國家大事與人們的「私事」，笑一陣，也嘆息一雨聲，這樣，姑且把一個勞苦的日子打發過去，同時，也準備用必需的勞苦來換取明天的一日間的生命。</p>
<p>就在這時候，在狹小弄口，來了一個大個子的漢子，反穿了一件「香雲紗」的大褂子，鈕扣是暢開的；那麼着，弄裏的大部份的人（凡是靠勞力換來的報酬還不够換取一家人的生活，而必需用可怕的「印子錢」來「貼補」的那些人們）全吃了一驚，猛地才記起今天是月底，是的，淸淸楚楚的，是月底，不是「印子老大」來收利錢了嗎？</p>
<p>「印子老大」，把他底龐大的身軀跨進了弄口，便無目標地向大家點了點頭；於是用眼睛向這一條弄裏的他的「欠戶」點了一次名，一面伸手到「香雲紗」大掛的衣袋裏去，摸出了了一口小小的，汚舊了的手褶：「叨光利鈿了呢。」</p>
<p>這條弄裏，人為了賺來的錢不够「開銷，向「印子老大」借那麽從三五塊到二三十塊錢的「印子錢」（月利六分半）的人家是不在少數的。借來，是為了日常的錢還不够用的緣故，不得已才走這一條「毒路」的，如果每個月還得抽出這不够用的些微的進欵，來付那麽重的利錢，當然是一件不十分容易的事啊！為了這，人每到月底看見「印子老大」的時候，心裏是會像落下了一塊大石頭那樣的沉重，而「印子老大」，明知道每月收這麽一筆利錢也不是容易的事，得費點口舌，費點麻煩，最後，還得費點小小的「手段」！</p>
<p>是的，「世道壞，人心也大不像徙前了」（印子老大，有時也那麽嘆息的）！貪一點利錢，犯了一筆老本，這放印子的事情可也眞的不容易幹了。要是沒有手段」，弄得不好，不但利錢拿不到，連自己的「老本」都要落空呢，「是些人可都不是好東西啊！要是沒有一點兒手段的話，哼……」</p>
<p>不錯，世道難，人還不出利錢，是事實；而印子老大的「手段」，却也是事實。他自己有「老頭子」，有「帮」裏的弟兄，也有手下的夥計；而且，他底「手段」在這一帶的居民是知道的。</p>
<p>為了這，當印子老大走進這弄口的當兒，人們便記起了是月底，也記起了恐懼與憂愁；於是，得把明天的米錢都掏出來，也有把褂子除下來取抵當的，也有實在一時掏不出「現貨」，而請求着一二天的寬放的，也求訴說着明知不會被恤憫的苦境的——談論着，駡着，咀咒着，解說着，緾繞着，各種不快意的聲調混合起來，夾着老大的大聲的呼叱，充塞了這小弄，也充塞了在高利貸的鐵手下轉輾着的人們底心像戰壕口的沙袋，與停滯在水底的礫石。</p>
<p>於是，老大縐了縐眉，暴怒地呼叱着，一面數着人們「繳」出來的利錢，一面在手摺上一一地蓋上了紅印，接着，便一點不放鬆地盤向着另一部份人的付欽的確實的日期。</p>
<p>「你說，你說呀！到底什麽日子拿出來，要是不付，說明了也不要緊呀；我老大幹這門生意也不是一年二年啦！你會放刁，我可也有我的手段呀！我……哼…」</p>
<p>逼着逼着，於是得到了回覆之後便搖擺地走出弄口，轉過一個灣，龐大的身影消失了。</p>
<p>可是，人却覺得印子老大的沉重的脚步彷彿是踏在他們身上似地，一天一天地，他那麽生活着……</p>
<h3>呌販</h3>
<p>— 施瑛</p>
<p>挑着擔子，從大街走到小巷，從市鎭走到村莊，每天，總是拖着疲倦的影子，拉起枯澀的聲音，叫賣着擔子裏的雜貨。—這擔子，正是生活的負擔，壓曲了他的肩膀。夏天下午的太陽，火傘似的蓋在綠野上，樹陰下的黃狗，也在吐着舌頭喘氣。他挑着擔子。淌着汗水，在那崎嶇的村徑上走。望到前面合抱的桑林中，有黑色的瓦屋，灰白的土牆，他知道又是那一個村莊了，也許那裏可以找到主顧，他手中的鈴，便搖了起來，像鈍刀割物一樣的沙聲喊着：「洋貨……阿要洋貨？—洋襪，毛巾，肥皂，花洋布。阿要……」走進那一個村莊裏，第一歡迎他的，便是狂吠的癩狗。男人們也許全下田做工去了，老小女人們，都受不住屋裏的潮濕和悶熱，坐在屋前的廣塲上；地上鋪着破席，讓孩子在破席上打滾和睡覺，自己手中做着活計。鈴聲，狗吠，帶有誘惑性的喊賈，自然喚起了她們的注意。她們的眼光，全望着那叫販。他挑着一對小櫃子，從玻璃門裏，可以看到裏面的東西。。眞的，雪白的毛巾，粉紅的嫩黃的洋襪，花花綠綠的紗布，靈巧可愛的雜件，肥皂，紐扣，針線，一切全有，他簡直挑着一家美麗的百貨商店。那些東西，全是她們平日所渴念的；她們也知道，擔子上的東西，比商店裏便宜，還價也容易。她們的眼中，閃起歆羨的火燄，可是，她們一想到錢，想到昨天還是男人上鎭去，花了三分利息，千求百懇地借到五塊錢，才買到現在培育必需的肥田粉，她們只能讓眼光去貧婪了。</p>
<p>叫販也聰明，他不能彀讓自己在毒日下趕了這許多路，卻賈不到一文錢回去。他在一棵老榆下歇了肩，從頭上脫去舊草帽，扇着汗水塵埃塗滿了的臉。嘴裏卻招呼聲她們：「嫂嫂，阿要上好的……。姑娘，這美麗的……」？那些年輕的女人，全丟下手裏的活計，簇集到他的擔前來，翻翻這個，看看那個。她們的聲音，雜亂得跟炒蠶豆一樣，詢問着一切東西的價錢，令他回答得應接不暇。她們還價的嘴更利害，似乎要他白送給她們才甘心；艱苦的生活，匱乏的金錢，她們眞要從一文錢看出四個字來。結果，櫃裏的東西，給她們翻成一團糟，而交易呢，卻只有一位老太太，花了兩個銅板，買了一包針。那些女人，雖然歆羨地圍着他，總捨不得錢。他也不曾不高興，因為現在這樣年頭見，無論到鎭上的那一條巷子，鄉下的那一個村莊，全是這樣子。從早晨挑起擔子出去，整天全在懷疑着，今天可賣得到一個銅板。可是管它賈得到賣不到，他終究要生活，他終究要背起生活的擔子奔波，他終究要忍受生活的磨難。現在小村樹陰下憇歇的一刻，邋是他僅有幸福的時候呢。他於是向一個女人要了一杯凉茶，用衣角抹抹臉上的汗水和塵埃，跟她們攀談起來了。自然談話結果，大家都是太息這年頭兒。……</p>
<p>太陽快下山了，他一天的奔波，一肩的重擔，巳令他精疲力盡了。可是擔子跟早晨出去時一樣，還是滿滿的重重的。他嫩着搖手中的鈴，反正這時候也沒有買賣好做。在荒凉的村徑上，在暗淡的夕陽下，他一步一步地回到市鎮去，計算着一天的生意，他只能咬着嘴唇，可是叫枯了的喉嚨，卻不能彀發出聲音來了。到了步雲橋，已經是市梢，鎭上的燈火在零落地點綴着黃昏了。他放下擔子，在橋欄上歇了一下，暫時享受河面的晚風。他想到了暗黑的家裏，也許還沒有上燈呢。</p>

<h3>法國汽車大王雪鐵龍逝世</h3>
<p>— （影呆）</p>
<p>法國汽車大王雪鐵龍M．Andre　Citroea氏。於本年七月三日。突然病率於巴黎某醫院。消息傳來。眞使全個世界的汽車界人表示哀卓呢。雪氏享年祇五十七歲。年紀並不大。照理還可活幾年。他的病已患了好久。直至最近。為了害胃癌。經醫師用手術之後。不料結果竟與世長逝了。雪鐵龍的死。不但使法國的實業界受到重大的打擊。甚至使整個的歐洲。受到相當的影響。因為歐戰之後。雪鐵龍本人。對於實業界。的確有偉大的貢獻。我們回想起來。去年十二月底。他一手創辦的雪鐵龍車廠。為了受不景氣的影響。一時間　不靈。有宣告淸理的消息。後來由政府援助。才得渡過難關。不致破產。那知曾幾何時。雪鐵龍廠現在雖勉強開着。而主人雪鐵龍氏。却以逝世傳聞。他的一死。無疑。是法國汽車界的莫大損失吧。</p>
<p>雪鐵龍氏，於一八七八年二月五日。誕生。早年時代。曾受重砲隊和工程隊的軍事訓練。那時他的確是一個為人注意的學生。他在軍事學校裏的成功。使他率業之後。在軍隊裏面服務。但他雖是一個有為的軍事家。他的心理。却很想在實業界中冒一次險。獨資倡辦一個工廠。</p>
<p>他在重砲隊中服役的年期。完滿之後。一九零一年他開始創辦一個小工廠。製造「雪鐵龍輸送機」。這種機器。是他自己所發明的。最初他的小工廠裏而祇僱用十個工人。一個打樣者。他自己。設計。技師。營業。主任。身兼數職。非常忙碌。但他的實業。自初期起。早就獲得相當的成功了。一九〇八年。他加入摩斯廠董事會。把摩斯廠重行改組。隸屬雪鐵龍公司。連得生產方法和市塲推銷。也盡行改變方策。這樣一來。他的出品。銷數不久就增加十倍。而他自己。那時又獲得很多重要的經騐。</p>
<p>後來歐戰爆發。他在陸軍第八十二隊重砲隊中服役。已獲得中尉資格。一九一五年他發表大量製造軍火的計劃。兩個月後。他在喬佛爾地方。創一火藥製造廠。那個工廠。是隸屬於雪鐵龍股份公司的。一個最大的工廠。每天可製造砲彈五〇·〇〇〇發。不久加到五五·〇〇〇發。同時他更貢獻煤炭的分配。和麵包的統制兩種新制度。</p>
<p>歐戰告終。凡爾賽和約簽字之後，他便開始製造十匹馬力的雪鐵龍汽車。這種汽車。當初為求大衆化起見。製造方法。非常簡單到一九一九年。他的車廠之中。每天已可製造汽軍三十輛。一九二四年每天製車四百輛。一九三零年六百輛。一九三三年一千輛。那時他採用一種推銷方法。完全由獨立的經售者銷售。他們的車輛。而到處設有樣子間。此外更努力於廣告方面。無論在墙壁上。走道上。到處有雪鐵龍廠的廣告。在他畢生事業之中。最值得我們贊美的。便是曾經資助過三個探險隊。使他們得以完成研究自然科學的工作。</p>
<p>一九三三年。雪鐵龍廠介紹一種完全新式的車輕。可是一九三四年三月起。廠方經濟惰形。非常危難。幾至破產。同年十二月。更有淸理之說。幸得政府援助。得以渡過難關。從此雪鐵龍廠又經一度改組。縮小範圍。樽節開支。勉強營業。可是最近他的逝世。却使雪鐵龍廠前途將更見暗淡。當然是法國汽車界的莫大損失啊。</p>
<h3>海外車訊彙報</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>古特立創製避彈車胎　各國的警務部和維持法律的機關。及軍事上所用各種汽車胎輪。除了具有普通的特質優點外。還需要避彈的作用。在這種用途上所用的汽車。他們行馳的速率是很是高的。所以實心的胎輪。常常不能合用。這種車子所需要的胎輪。除了有空氣胎的回彈力之外。還要有抵禦刺孔的質料。古特立公司本為製造胎輪的高手。現在新創一種海綿體橡皮塡料。對於這種塲合所需的各點。都能滿意的應付。當在意外受到槍彈的轟擊之後。這種用橡皮塡料的胎輸。不能於毫不中用的了。因為在刺孔的地方祇有幾個小的空氣窩囊。其餘的海綿體朝了輪鞘仍舊可以生出彈歷的力量。來支持全車。因此除失全輸胎破裂毀損。這種海綿橡皮塡料不再存在的時候。胎輪的動作是一些不會受着影響的。</p>
<p>遊歴魁北克旅客增多　據坎拿大的魁北克省旅行局的統計。遊行魁北克的遊客數見增加。此足見美人之所以多趨坎拿大者乃因其不禁酒之說。實屬附會。一九三四年夏美國初次開放酒禁。由美往魁北克省境之汽車計有三七〇，〇〇〇輛。其他如火車船舶公共汽車等載客運輸亦較勝於一九三三年。目下魁北克省之公路。據稱已達一六，〇〇〇公里。此亦為遊客增多之原因云。</p>
<p>惠廉士哇浮蘭車產額　美國托利多地方之惠廉士哇浮蘭廠。近來製造汽車的數量。大為增進。據該廠銷售經理阿邱氏云。一九三四年時該廠造車七，五〇〇輛。但在一九三五年開首的七個月底的七月杪。其產量可以達到一八，〇〇〇輛。此數較之一九三四年將加一倍。又據報稱該廠在不久的幾個月後。更將出車一〇，〇〇〇輛云。</p>
<p>通用車廠獲利計數　今年第二季通用汽車公所調的純利計美金四九，九二五，〇〇〇元。合計每一普通股一元一角七分。去年同時為三七，九七三，〇〇〇元，每股八角八分。今年開首之六個中通用所獲之純利計七九，一四一，〇〇〇元，每股利益為一元八角五分，一九三四年同時為六四，九九八，〇〇〇元。每股獲一元五角一分。一九三五年第二季所售出之通用車價值美金三四三，二〇九，〇〇〇元，一九三四年同時為三〇九，七〇六，〇〇〇元。今年上半年之銷售車輛價值為五九四，八八四，〇〇〇元。去年同時為五一九，六七八，〇〇〇元　九三五年六月三十日之通用流動資金為三四〇，六六七，〇〇〇元。去年六月三十日為二九九，八三八，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>服務派卡二十五年　凡在美國派卡汽車廠連續服務至二十五年的。公司當局便給他一個金別針以為紀念。最近該公司又有二十九人。因為二十五年的長久工作。得有資格在衣襟上挿着黃澄澄的金別針。這二十九人中包括總理亞文麥考萊氏。到們在去年正月一日都已完成了這個長時期的服務。在他為公司服務二十五週歲的那天。麥氏向其他纔滿二十五年服務的諸人祝賀。並親自投給他們每人一枝渴望已久的二十五年服務紀念別針。除了大家互相祝賀之外。其他汽車公司當局和各業領袖。對於麥氏都慶祝一番。據派卡公司歷年的紀錄。職工中連續工作達二十五年的共有二百三十六人。連續服務達二十年的計五百二十八人。全廠中僱工服務過五年以上的。約佔總數百分之四十四。</p>
<p>康茂貨車歷盡滄桑　康茂車廠為求製造上的精良。和適應各地的特殊需要起見。常派專員往各地調查考察。然後把考查的結果。製造成適用的汽車。所以他們行銷於派太谷尼亞·紐絲倫·和西比利亞等處的運貨車。製造上略有不同。在大戰的時候。英軍部曾徵發國中各種運貨汽車為軍用品。制止運輸外出。後來英軍在西綫獲得德軍的運貨汽車一輛。發現他是康茂牌子。當卽加以查究。原來這車係一九一二年時由羅東廠家出售於俄軍部，在東波羅西亞被德人掠去。應用於法境之內。經過若干時後。重返英人的手中。拿來攻擊他的敵人。這輛康茂可謂歷盡滄桑。而他的經久耐用。倒也不可忽視哩。</p>
<h3>滬粵公路駕車記</h3>
<p>有閩人倪君柝聲者。日前偕友人二。駕自備Y式小福特汽車作長途行。藉以考察沿途公路發展之實况。先由上海出發。循滬杭公路而達杭州。再由杭州經玉山南昌長沙衡山贛州大庾南雄至韶關轉汕頭而抵廣州。行程自上海至韶關計一千〇二十三英里。韶關經汕頭至廣州。計七百五十六英里。兩共一千七百七十九英里。車行時間。則上海至韶關之一段為五十七小時。韶關經汕頭至廣州之一段為六十五小時。共計一百二十二小時。後段行程較短。而費時反較前段為多。此因汕頭廣州之間。崎嶇難行。兼須繞道故耳。此次所用之汽油。共一百〇六加侖。除南昌長沙間曾往返一次。及沿途停歇多耗外。平均每加侖約行二十四英里。據倪君言。此行所經之道路。都為最近所興築者。而湖南之公路。處處根據科學。整齊堅實。要為各省之冠。卽較之歐美亦無多讓。聞倪君於秋凉後。尚擬作貴州之行。我國近雖努力興築公路。而駕車作長途旅行者。尚不多觀。倪君之毅力殊堪欽佩。又有一事足述者。倪君於出發之前。曾將此長途行駛之小福特汽車。令候車者加以檢視修理。初未告以用途之原委。條車者祇按尋手續一爲修整。迨平安到達廣州。機械上竟無阻碍發生。聞者訝之。故倪君對於福特汽車之耐用穩捷。深為滿意。而各處福特經理處服務週到。不憚煩勞。尤有足多者焉。</p>

<h3>Economic Committee Studies Yellow River Blocking and Diversion, Water Conservancy Office Held a Discussion Yesterday, Concrete Measures Have Been Drafted, Shandong Provincial Government Emphasizes Engineering, Yellow River Commission Emphasizes Technology</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Water Conservancy Office of the Economic Committee invited representatives from the Shandong Provincial Government and the Yellow River Commission on the morning of the 6th to hold a discussion on how to divert the flow back into the main river before the Dongzhuang breach is blocked, and to prepare for the blocking. The discussion also covered how to ensure complete coordination of engineering materials and technology needs. Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Construction Department, Kong Xiangrong of the Yellow River Commission, Zheng Zhaojing of the Water Conservancy Office, and foreign consultant engineers Potterie and Yang Bole attended. As a result of the discussion, concrete measures have been drafted. The content is that Shandong Province focuses on engineering, and the Yellow River Commission focuses on technology. According to Zheng Zhaojing, although the views of the Jiangsu and Shandong authorities on the Yellow River problem have been slightly different in the past, they have completely agreed after exchanging opinions. The water flowing into the southern bank lakes in Jiangsu will be diverted into Donghu Lake, and the water flowing into Weishan Lake will be diverted into the central canal, Liutang River. In Shandong, in addition to blocking the breach, all major diversions will be directed back into the main river. The technical committee has already drafted a detailed plan. After the representatives return to their provinces, they will immediately start practical work according to the plan without delay. As for funding, the Economic Committee has been allocating funds successively, which is not a problem. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yellow River Management Conference convened by the National Economic Committee held a technical meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the blocking technology in detail. It is estimated that it will cost more than 1.1 million to divert the water flowing into Nanwang Lake into Dongping Lake and return it to the Yellow River. The project will be carried out by the Yellow River Commission and the Shandong Provincial Government. Before the Dongzhuang breach is blocked, it will cost 1.7 million to divert the flow back into the main river. Furthermore, the project of discharging the water flowing into Weishan Lake through various rivers into the sea will be the responsibility of the Huai River Diversion Commission. The meeting continued at 10:00 am on the 6th, with the participation of various engineering experts and Zhang Honglie, etc. It was decided that Shandong Province would first carry out sedimentation and flow cutoff projects at each breach mouth within a week to reduce the number of diversions and prevent the breach mouths from expanding further, so as to avoid flooding of Weishan Lake and facilitate future blocking projects. Regarding the required materials, it was decided to requisition them nearby, and the Shandong Provincial Government will be responsible for managing the military engineering supplies, etc. The Yellow River Commission will immediately send engineering personnel to design. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Shen Baixian returned to the province on the night of the 5th. In a discussion on the 6th, he said that the Economic Conference decided to divert the Yellow River water in separate ways. The maximum flow rate of water diverted from Weishan Lake into the canal can accommodate 500 cubic meters per second. This will be the limit in the future. Currently, the main Yellow River prevention work in Jiangsu Province is to rush to repair the dikes of the central canal and Liutang River to prevent flooding. The Huai River Diversion Commission and the provincial authorities will send personnel to the north to inspect everything within days. If necessary, he will also go. If the Huai and Yi rivers do not rise again, the danger can be reduced. Only the border area of Fengshi in Yutai Yangkou has been slightly affected. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Honglie said that he had just received a telegram from Shandong, stating that the magistrates of ten counties, including Zhencheng and Heze, went to the Jinan Construction Experimental Zone Commander's Office in Jining on the 6th to petition for the start of the blocking project as soon as possible. Since the Yellow River breach, all these counties have become waterlogged. Now the Yellow River water in Jining is approaching the Jinpu Railway, and Hanzhuang Station is about to be affected. The water overflowing from Yutai Lake and dikes flows southwest from Jinxiang and Caoxian towards the Longhai Railway. The transportation artery is in danger of being cut off. He will visit the central authorities again on the morning of the 7th to request prompt blocking of the breach and disaster relief, and return to Shandong that evening. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Vast Disaster Area in Western Shandong</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Wang Shaochang reported to Nanjing by telegram, stating that the disaster area in western Shandong is more than 300 li from east to west and 250 li from north to south, with 5 million disaster victims. Such an unprecedented catastrophe has not seen overall relief, only the construction of dikes in neighboring provinces. 5 million disaster victims are resentful and unwilling to live, and may take risks. They have gone from disappointment to resentment towards the country and the local authorities. Even if the people of Shandong are not worth cherishing, if the breached water is not blocked, the Jinpu and Longhai railways will be in danger within ten days. The words are extremely painful. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River is rising both upstream and downstream. The water level at Luokou is 29 meters, 5 cun, and 2 fen, rising 6 cun and 4 fen. The River Bureau has ordered strict flood prevention in all sections. (5th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Cang County City River New Dike Collapsed</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The new dike in the Zhaelizhuang section of the Cang County City River collapsed for more than 50 zhang on the night of the 4th due to its new construction and loose soil quality. The flood overflowed, and countless houses and livestock were swept away. Residents of various villages fled in the middle of the night, and all their belongings were submerged. More than 100 villages, including Doujiazhuang, were flooded, with water depths ranging from four to five chi. The disaster victims were trapped on rooftops, and the situation was extremely tragic. The county government is requisitioning civilian boats for rescue. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Fengpei Northern Border Water Situation Stable</h3>
<p>(Tuzhou) A telephone call from Pei County stated that the water situation in the northern border of Fengpei is stable today. After the water reached the new dike, it seemed to have stopped rising. Villages and fields north of the dike have been affected by the disaster. Many villages with fortresses have built enclosures to prevent flooding, similar to the enclosed fields in Jiangnan. There is currently no way to provide relief to the disaster victims. The Hanzhuang Water Station telegraphed that the water levels of the lake mouth and the canal are rising, two or three cun higher than yesterday, indicating that the Weishan water has entered the canal. The downstream area should be strictly guarded. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A telegram from Pei County stated that the water situation at Longguji in northern Pei is stable. Yu Keyu, the section chief sent by the Commissioner's Office, has been stationed at the Longguji dike for days, directing the defense. The water at Gaozhuang has not continued to rise. The people's dike in Sanhe Township has also collapsed, and the water is 10 meters away from the new dike. A telegram from Feng County stated that the water north of the Xiao Yan dike is one chi deep. The water depth at the dike digging site is one cun. After the water collapsed the people's dike and reached the dike root, it has not continued to rise. (6th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan passed an order at its meeting on the 6th to instruct all provinces and cities to provide water disaster relief. The original order said: (Omitted) Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been continuous heavy rains and mountain floods. In the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River basins, major dikes have breached, or people's dikes have collapsed. The floodwaters have overflowed and washed away everything, making rescue impossible and causing serious disasters. The provinces and cities have successively reported the disaster situation, and the central government has sent personnel to investigate. Although there are no accurate statistics on the submerged population, livestock, fields, and houses, the severity of the disaster is almost equal to that of the 20th year of the Republic of China. After last year's bumper harvest, it was followed by the disaster of floods, and the sight of devastation is deeply regrettable. In June of this year, the central government, in accordance with the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law, formulated the Provisional Measures for the Implementation of Disaster Relief Reserves and the Organizational Regulations of the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee, which were promulgated. In the current year's budget expenditure, 2 million yuan was allocated for the disaster relief reserve fund. On one hand, the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee was organized and established. In addition to the work relief part, the disaster-stricken provinces and cities should make the most of the existing projects to accommodate the disaster victims. As for agricultural relief and emergency relief, they should be allocated according to the severity of the disaster in each province, using one-half of the disaster relief reserve fund in accordance with the law. However, the disaster area is too large, and the national treasury's financial resources are limited. According to Article 2 of the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law, the provincial government should spend 2% of its total regular budget revenue each year as the provincial disaster relief reserve fund, and it is stipulated in Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Measures for the Implementation of Disaster Relief Reserves that provinces whose disaster relief reserve funds are not legally deposited shall not request central subsidies. Because the disaster is severe, it is impossible to reverse this catastrophe without concerted efforts. Therefore, it is earnestly declared that it must be implemented. From the date of receipt of the document, all relevant regulations should be followed, the provincial disaster relief reserve fund should be included in the provincial budget, and the provincial disaster relief reserve fund management committee should be organized and reported. In this way, internal and external support can be maintained, those who have not been affected by the disaster can strengthen their strength in peacetime, and those who have been affected by the disaster can save their lives. Letting the people in the disaster area get relief one day earlier will reduce the loss of vitality by one point, which will benefit the people's livelihood and the national economy. Acting President of the Executive Yuan, Kong Xiangxi. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan passed the principles for disaster relief in the provinces along the Yangtze River at its meeting on the 6th. (1) Regarding the work relief items, it is proposed that the Executive Yuan instruct the departments and committees and the provincial governments to make every effort to adopt the method of work relief to accommodate disaster victims to work and provide relief for various projects that have been planned and are being handled. (2) Regarding agricultural relief and emergency relief, it is proposed not to list them separately. The Ministry of Finance and the Relief Committee will allocate 1 million yuan from the central disaster relief reserve fund for this year, which can be used in accordance with the law, according to the disaster situation in each province, taking into account the severity and urgency. (3) It is proposed that the Executive Yuan order the disaster-stricken provincial governments to ascertain the disaster situation and reduce or exempt land tax accordingly.

<h3>South Canal Water Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level in the South Canal rose sharply on the evening of the 5th, reaching 21 chi and 5 cun. The River Bureau received a report from Liu Xizhang, the head of the first work section, that the small enclosure in Dongguang County on the east bank of the canal and the Zhangjia dike on the west bank had collapsed, which was extremely dangerous. After working with civilians and police to reinforce the dikes, they were stabilized. However, the Liao family dike was weak, and three leaks were discovered, which were about to collapse. 200 civilians were throwing and pressing sacks day and night. Please provide assistance quickly. The River Bureau transported 1,000 sacks on the 6th for application and sent Cui Shaoyan, the head of the second section, to supervise and urge the reinforcement efforts. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Construction Department believed that the South Canal had entered a dangerous situation, and telegraphed the River Bureau on the 5th to order all sections to strengthen their defenses and ordered more than ten counties along the river, including Dongguang, to collect civilians to protect the dikes. On the 6th, the South Canal Bureau telegraphed the Hebei Construction Department, reporting that the Zhangjia dike and the Liao family dike in Dongguang County had collapsed. The section chief is supervising civilians to reinforce the dikes, but the need for funds and materials is very urgent. It is hoped that they will be allocated quickly. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Relief Committee Discusses Fundraising Methods</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) The city government convened people from all walks of life on the 5th to discuss the establishment of a disaster relief fundraising committee. 57 members were elected, and Shen Honglie was appointed as the chairman. On the afternoon of the 6th, the committee continued to meet and selected 17 people, including Hu Jiafeng, as standing committee members. Three groups were set up: general affairs, entertainment, and fundraising, and fundraising methods were determined: 1. Double deduction of salaries based on the previous aircraft donation amount, for a period of four months. 2. Theater performance for five days and horse race for six days. 3. Donation to the tomb, an additional surcharge of 10% on the business of entertainment venues, restaurants, and hotels to be used for disaster relief, and a surcharge of 10% on rent.

<h3>The Current Stage of the Abyssinian Crisis</h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The resolution passed by the League of Nations Council regarding the Abyssinian issue, analyzed, yields four key points: First, based on the resolution of May 25th of this year, and in accordance with Article 5 of the 1928 Italo-Ethiopian Treaty, to continue its arbitration work. This is the fundamental principle of the League of Nations in handling this case. Compared to the situation in May, there seems to be no change today. Second, the Arbitration Committee will not allow disputes regarding the sovereignty of the Walwal area. This is a victory for Mussolini's claim. Third, to immediately appoint the fifth arbitrator. This is the implementation of the League of Nations' resolution from May. Fourth, to convene the League of Nations Council on September 4th of this year to either review the results of the arbitration or discuss the Abyssinian issue comprehensively. This point has greater implications for the future of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute.</p>
<p>Whether the League of Nations can resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute peacefully depends entirely on what attitude and efforts the major powers seeking to eliminate war will take. Therefore, the diplomatic activities of the major powers are even more noteworthy than the League of Nations' situation. Before the opening of the League of Nations Council, representatives of Britain and France jointly stated with the Italian representative that diplomatic negotiations would be held in France based on the 1906 Tripartite Treaty. Although the outcome is unpredictable, this is something that British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, had repeatedly contacted Mussolini about without success. Now the three countries have reached a consensus. Some say that this is an action outside the scope of the League of Nations, which harms the function of the League of Nations. Others say that Abyssinia is being abandoned, and Britain, France, and Italy are suspected of dividing East Africa. These outside opinions are put aside for now. In short, in this highly volatile and serious situation, leaving room for all parties to negotiate calmly can be considered a glimmer of hope in the peace movement.</p>
<p>As for the United States, which stands outside the situation but has the ability to influence the League of Nations, what is its attitude towards this case? The United States has recently been focused on its domestic recovery movement. It is already taking a wait-and-see approach to the Far East, and it is even less willing to seek trouble in East Africa. Since President Roosevelt announced the Good Neighbor Policy, his attitude has been even more obvious. Africa has always been a European colony, and the raw materials produced in Africa are abundant in Central and South America. The United States has little relationship with Africa, except for the two independent countries of Liberia and Abyssinia. The former is because of the migration of African Americans, where the United States is in the position of protector. The latter is just a slightly diplomatic relationship. As for why Abyssinia has become a problem, it is because Britain and France see it as the meeting point of two routes for north-south development (the Cape Town to Cairo connection plan) and east-west development (the breakthrough plan from Cape Verde to French Somaliland). For Italy, it is the object of its East African monopoly plan. This has no direct relationship with the United States. This is why it does not want to get involved in the vortex. However, the United States shares the same sentiment as Britain and France in maintaining world peace. Therefore, the United States is also willing to put in a little effort in terms of morality and diplomacy. Judging from the replies of US Secretary of State Hull regarding the Kellogg-Briand Pact and Abyssinia, and President Roosevelt's indirect remarks in Washington during the League of Nations meeting, remotely supporting the British side, we can know the objective intention of the United States.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Advisor Dies in Sui Bin County; Eight Killed, Seven Wounded</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Dongbao newspaper, the misfortune on the Jingtu Railway has been occurring since November 17, 1932, when the rebel army attacked Yingchengzi Station. Because the Japanese-Manchu military and police security was very sufficient, there had been no incidents until now. Recently, this misfortune suddenly occurred, and the siege in the evening was a bold and invincible act. Since the beginning of this year, there have been six attacks on trains, all carried out by communist-affiliated rebel armies. Their tactics are very clever, and the road destruction situation is as follows:</p>
<p>March 14th: Attacked Mifeng Station on the Binsui Railway. No casualties.</p>
<p>May 2nd: Attacked Halbaling on the Jingtu Railway. More than 200 Korean communists, nine soldiers and civilians killed, 17 captured.</p>

But when we think about the fact that there are still so many young believers in Germany who are devout and unyielding, we can also be happy.

<h3>Mussolini Again Transfers 70,000 Troops to Africa; Aviation Undersecretary Goes to Inspect the Air Force</h3>
<p>(Rome) Although Italy has agreed to abide by the League of Nations' compromise solution regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, it is still actively preparing for war. An order was issued today to recruit another 70,000 soldiers to East Africa, including two divisions of regular troops, one division of Blackshirts, and other troops who will be recruited to replenish domestic forces. At the same time, several ships are currently busy loading goods in preparation for sailing to Africa. (Telecommunications from Reuters on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today also ordered the mobilization of two army divisions to East Africa, one being the "Asiata Division," concentrated in the Adige area, under the command of General Ligarti, and the other being the "Corseria Division," concentrated in the Imperia area, under the command of General Bendor. In addition, Italian volunteers residing abroad and former veterans are led by army students undergoing short-term training to form the Sixth Division of the Fascist Party's army, which is concentrated and awaiting dispatch, with General Pascaldi serving as commander. The mobilization of the above divisions is progressing very well. To date, the total number of Italian troops sent to East Africa has reached twelve divisions. (Telecommunications from Havas on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini today again mobilized 65,000 troops to East Africa, stating that although the League of Nations Executive Council has entrusted the Italo-Ethiopian border dispute to arbitration and established a reconciliation solution, the relationship between the two countries remains tense. Italy deems it necessary to continue mobilization in order to prepare for any eventuality. (Telecommunications from the National Press Agency on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini, in view of Ethiopia's continuous mobilization of troops, issued the ninth mobilization order this afternoon. This batch of troops includes two divisions, those towards the French border region of the Biteman province. (Telecommunications from the National Press Agency on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, the Italian government again mobilized the "Asiatai Division" and the "Corseria Division" to East Africa, as mentioned in the previous telegram from Havas. After these two divisions are sent to East Africa, the total number of Italian troops in East Africa will reach twelve divisions, including seven army divisions and five Fascist Party army divisions. In addition to the above twelve divisions, the Italian volunteer army residing abroad will now be formed into a Party army division in preparation for deployment to East Africa. According to a report from the "Great War Volunteer Soldiers Association," 2,000 volunteer soldiers have been authorized to go to East Africa, and another 4,000 are requesting to join the army and are still under review. In addition, Count Ciano, the son-in-law of Prime Minister Mussolini and current Minister of Propaganda, will also go to East Africa to take on military duties. It is said that Italy's military preparations in East Africa eased slightly at the end of July, but have recently accelerated again. The Italian government believes that even if the three-nation meeting of Britain, France, and Italy is held in accordance with the 1906 treaty to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian issue, it may not yield satisfactory results. And even if an agreement is reached between the three countries allowing Italy to develop its economic power in Ethiopia, it is necessary to increase security in East Africa in order to protect Italy's economic interests. This is why Italy continues to send troops to East Africa. (Telecommunications from Havas on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Ethiopia Still Fears Italian Military Preparations; Cables Thanks to Various Countries for Upholding Peace; The Ethiopian Emperor Receives the US Representative</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The news of the League of Nations Executive Council's passage of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute resolution has only made people more indignant. They say that Italy can more calmly prepare for war within the month before the Executive Council reconvenes. A senior government official today told a guest that Ethiopia is deeply regretful that Italy has consistently refused to make a declaration not to resort to force. Without this firm declaration from Italy, it will continue to prepare for the long-rumored offensive. At the same time, we sincerely accept the recommendations of the League of Nations, but it is doubtful whether the strength of the League of Nations can make it effective. After receiving the full text of the League of Nations resolution here, a statement was issued stating that the Ethiopian government is very satisfied with the League of Nations Executive Council's decision to hold a meeting on September 4 to conduct a comprehensive review of all aspects of Italo-Ethiopian relations, as the Ethiopian government has never slackened in its request for such a review to be conducted in the past eight months. (Telecommunications from Reuters on the 5th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Ethiopian Emperor formally received US Chargé d'Affaires Angerde today. At that time, the Ethiopian Emperor expressed his gratitude to Angerde for President Roosevelt's statement last week and called it an example of the American people's love of peace. He also praised the work of American clergymen in Ethiopia. (Telecommunications from the National Press on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Ethiopian Emperor sent a telegram to the League of Nations Executive Council today, expressing his thanks to various countries for their efforts to maintain peace in East Africa, and stated that he is determined to achieve a just and peaceful resolution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. (Telecommunications from the National Press on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat received a thank-you telegram from the Ethiopian Emperor on the 4th, urging them to express his thanks to the representatives of various countries who worked hard to pass the Executive Council's resolution, and stated that the Ethiopian government reaffirms its determination to resolve this dispute peacefully and fairly, hoping that the League of Nations will make every effort to achieve peace. (Telecommunications from the National Press on the 5th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a press release regarding the resolution passed by the League of Nations Executive Council the other day: "The Ethiopian government has just read the two resolutions passed by the League of Nations Executive Council on August 3. The issue of responsibility for the Walwal incident will be decided by the fifth arbitrator. According to the first resolution of the Executive Council, it seems possible to arbitrate the two disputed encounters, but no matter how the arbitration committee decides, the fact that Walwal was drawn within Ethiopian territory on the official maps drawn by Italy can hardly be concealed. As for the memorandum previously submitted by Italy, it only points out that the current Walwal has been substantially occupied by Italian troops. As for the second resolution of the Executive Council, which stipulates that the Executive Council will hold a meeting on September 4 to conduct a comprehensive consideration of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, this action is sufficient to fully satisfy the Ethiopian government, as the Ethiopian Emperor has requested the Executive Council to handle the Italo-Ethiopian dispute for eight months now, and this policy has remained unchanged." (Telecommunications from Havas on the 5th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: A statement was issued here today criticizing the League of Nations Executive Council's resolution on the Italo-Ethiopian issue this time, stating that Walwal is within Ethiopian territory, which is clearly marked on Italian maps, and that Italy issued a memorandum to Ethiopia several years ago stating that Walwal was occupied by Italian troops, which further shows that Walwal is Ethiopian territory. The arbitration committee should not completely disregard this point. The statement expressed satisfaction with the third resolution of the Executive Council, as Ethiopia's request for the study of the entire conflict issue has been for eight months now. However, the statement did not mention the three-power conference based on the 1906 treaty, apparently due to Ethiopia's suspicion of this treaty. According to government sources, Ethiopia cannot recognize any economic concessions beyond what it has previously allowed, and political concessions are even out of the question. Also, one Turkish military officer here, said to have obtained permission from his home government, will serve as a military advisor to the Ethiopian government, and the Ethiopian authorities have accepted. (Telecommunications from the National Press on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Denies Selling Arms to Ethiopia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In response to reports from London that Japan is supplying arms to Ethiopia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today clarifying the situation regarding Japanese arms manufacturing in order to avoid misunderstandings abroad. The content of the statement is as follows: The Japanese government has never allowed people to manufacture arms privately. All arms exports must be made through the Taihei Kumiai, and only after obtaining government permission can they be sold abroad. Recently, the Taihei Kumiai has not requested the government to issue export permits for weapons. Therefore, there is no basis for the claim that the Ethiopian government and Japanese merchants have concluded arms contracts. Examining the situation in Ethiopia, the railway from Djibouti to Addis Ababa is under the influence of France and Italy. Therefore, without the permission of France and Italy, it is absolutely impossible in fact to transport arms under Djibouti to Addis Ababa. (Telecommunications from Nihon Rengo on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are rumors that Ethiopia has signed a contract with Japanese arms dealers to purchase arms, or that Japan will send military advisors to Ethiopia, etc. However, the Army authorities issued a statement on the 6th denying this claim. Japan has private arms manufacturing factories, but the government's supervision is very strict and they are not allowed to sell them abroad freely. To date, no arms dealer has requested the government to allow the sale of arms. The rumors are completely untrue. (Telecommunications from Nihon Rengo on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Strike Riots in Crete, Greece Suppressed; Three Dead, Thirty-seven Wounded</h3>

He surrounded Candia with troops, and when he demanded the strikers to surrender, they quietly dispersed. He met with a delegation of strikers and listened to their demands. Therefore, they agreed to obey the authorities. It is reported that three people died and twenty were injured during the conflict between the strikers and the military police, and seventeen soldiers were also injured. After the riots broke out, armed police rushed to suppress them and declared martial law. (Telecommunications from Reuters on the 5th)</p>
<p>Athens: The situation on the island of Crete has suddenly become serious. Government agencies have stopped working. The Greek government immediately dispatched two warships to the scene to restore order and declared martial law. It is said that there are a total of 4,000 strikers. When the conflict occurred with the police, a total of 100 people were injured on the workers' side. The Greek fleet is now concentrated near Athens, waiting for orders to depart. It is heard that this incident is directly or indirectly related to the forces of Venizelos. Venizelos is a Cretan, and his party members, in order to promote their political goals, advocate that workers adopt a policy of force. They united with the workers to attack and occupy the town hall. It is heard that Bakoboro, the commander of the defense forces on the island of Crete, and Chief of Police Shedoko were both seriously injured. The Greek government now believes that it can completely restore order within two days. The latest reports claim that the rebels have completely occupied the town of Heraklion and five bombers have now been ordered to depart from Athens. If they encounter resistance from the rebels, they will carry out bombing. (Telecommunications from the National Press on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times believes that the general strike on the island of Crete is a new political movement. The rebels have clashed with government forces multiple times, occupied arsenals, and used the captured weapons to repel the troops. The number of troops is small and unable to resist the thousands of rebels. Army Chief Gondilis ordered the suppression of the rebellion, without mercy. The majority of the defense forces at the Athens airfield also rebelled after hearing about the uprising on the island of Crete. After a fierce battle, it was finally put down. As a result, fifteen rebel soldiers were captured and will be tried by a military court. (Telecommunications from the National Press on the 5th)</p>
<p>Athens: It was announced here today that the rebellion in Candia has ended. The strikers have accepted the final warning and surrendered their weapons unconditionally and disbanded. The government had previously accepted the wage demands of the strikers. (Telecommunications from the National Press on the 5th)</p>
<p>Heraklion, Greece: The island of Crete today declared martial law due to the joint disturbance of public order by politically disgruntled elements and labor protesters. The government is taking measures to avoid riots. Originally there was a strike movement in Crete, and in mid-March of this year, the remnants of the revolution that supported former Prime Minister Venizelos seized the opportunity to create difficulties for the government, leading the masses into public agencies.

<h3>The Puppet State and Outer Mongolia: Exchange of Representatives Issue; Outer Mongolia Only Permits Handling Border Disputes</h3>
<p>(Changchun) After the "Manchukuo" Foreign Affairs Office received a reply from Outer Mongolia regarding the handling of Manchu-Mongolian border disputes, it issued the following statement on the 6th: Outer Mongolia responded to Manchukuo's request on July 29th, proposing that if the powers of the representatives are limited to handling border disputes and the representatives are stationed near the border in mutually designated locations, there would be no objection to exchanging representatives. However, as the proposal contained many ambiguous and unreasonable points, the "Manchukuo" representative in Manchuria suggested on the 5th that Outer Mongolia's request to limit the powers of the representatives to handling border disputes be accepted.  The representative also specifically indicated the locations where the representatives of both countries would be stationed and further requested the exchange of central representatives to handle matters that could not be resolved locally. (6th Dispatch Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The main points of the third request made by "Manchukuo" to Outer Mongolia at the Manchuria meeting on the 5th are that the permanent representative offices of the two countries should be divided into central representatives and local representatives. The specific requirements from Manchukuo are as follows:</p>
<p>Although the central representatives are not plenipotentiary ambassadors or formal diplomatic organs of the two countries like ambassadors, they must, in substance, be representative organs of the two governments, permanently stationed in Changchun and Kulun to handle friendly relations and diplomatic negotiations between the two countries; (2) Local representatives are solely responsible for handling border disputes, permanently stationed in two locations near the border, with "Manchukuo" representatives stationed in Outer Mongolia and Outer Mongolian representatives stationed in "Manchukuo," with the intention of fundamentally resolving the long-standing border issues between the two countries, and further hoping to restore normal diplomatic relations between Manchukuo and Mongolia. (6th Dispatch Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) A Kulun dispatch states that Manchukuo made a further proposal to Mongolia on July 17th. On July 29th, Sambuu presented the Mongolian reply to Ganji, the representative of the Manchukuo Foreign Affairs Department. The reply stated that Mongolia had previously suggested establishing a permanent joint committee to arbitrate border disputes. However, in its reply, Manchukuo issued an ultimatum demanding that Manchukuo representatives be allowed to reside in Mongolian territory at locations chosen by Manchukuo. Otherwise, Mongolian border troops must be completely withdrawn. Mongolia refused to accept these demands, as they infringed upon Mongolian sovereignty and were a direct insult.</p>
<p>Mongolia acknowledges that in the proposal made by Manchukuo on July 17th, it no longer insisted on unilaterally dispatching representatives, but suggested exchanging plenipotentiary representatives. In order to assist in maintaining border peace, Mongolia believes that if the representatives' powers are limited to resolving border issues and their locations are designated by their respective governments near the border to allow for rapid and active intervention when border disputes reoccur, then Mongolia would not object. Mongolia further believes that these representatives should also serve as joint chair representatives on the Border Committee. Mongolia proposed the establishment of the Border Committee, and Manchukuo did not object. (6th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka's Future Mission: Reorganize the South Manchuria Railway to Promote Economic Development in China</h3>
<p>The Japanese-language Manchuria Daily reported on the 2nd of this month that since Count Hayashi Hirotaro resigned and it was decided that Matsuoka Yosuke would succeed him, a wave of change has swept through the South Manchuria Railway Company, both internally and externally. Matsuoka Yosuke has been widely noticed since his activities in Geneva. How Matsuoka will build his foundation in the domestic political world and how Matsuoka will decide to guide the future of the South Manchuria Railway Company have become the focus of attention within the company. According to most observers, the focus will be on resolving the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway Company and expanding economic work in China. It is recalled that the issue of reorganizing the South Manchuria Railway Company has been stalled since the local plan was submitted to the central government in December of Showa 8 (1933). However, the South Manchuria Railway Company itself also believes that after the Incident, it should adapt to the new situation and undergo reforms. This is also a long-standing desire of the military. However, implementing this major issue requires a person with great vision, credibility in all aspects, and who is trusted by the company. Matsuoka is well-suited for this task because he has gained the favor of the military. As for the reorganization issue, there are four main points: (1) Whether railway control is possible; (2) Whether coal mine separation is possible; (3) Whether the establishment of a new trading company is possible; (4) Whether the transfer of local administration is possible. The fourth point has been decided to be newly established, but it is still pending implementation. It will be implemented after the new president makes a decision on the transfer of local administration. The transfer of local administration has been a long-standing issue that has not been resolved for many years. Matsuoka has expressed his view on this issue, advocating the pure economic organization of the South Manchuria Railway, advocating transfer, and also advocating the abolition of extraterritoriality and the transfer of affiliated lands. Therefore, it is only a matter of time. The most difficult aspects are the railway and coal mine issues. If the two are separated, the South Manchuria Railway will undergo a major transformation. If they are not separated, the degree of reform will be relatively minor. Furthermore, the integration of the Railway Department and the General Bureau's finances has, in fact, become a new railway company. This is now gradually coming to the surface. However, harmonizing the contradictions between the Railway Department and the General Bureau, while also making the entire Manchurian railway organically operated, requires the decision of the new president. As for the second step, the expansion of economic work in China relies on Matsuoka's skills. Matsuoka had aspirations when he was a director. Now that the situation in North China has changed, Matsuoka can observe inside and outside the company and develop his plans. In particular, the procurement of funds is an important issue for the South Manchuria Railway in the future. To obtain new funds, it is necessary to expand the limits of corporate bonds. However, this year's corporate bond plan has encountered various difficulties. The new President Matsuoka may be able to obtain assistance from the central government to manage reasonably and procure funds.</p>
<h3>Japan's Seiyukai Party Decides on New Policies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In preparation for the upcoming prefectural assembly elections and general elections, the Seiyukai held a joint meeting of executives and policy research staff on the 6th and decided on new policies. The main points are summarized below: (1) The National Essence Issue: The fundamental meaning of the national polity is the unchanging belief of the people. Any words or actions that disrupt or violate the so-called Emperor Organ Theory cannot be tolerated in the slightest. (2) National Policy Issues: In view of the world situation and Japan's position, the extraordinary circumstances of the times have become even more serious. National defense and industry urgently need to seek a mutually beneficial policy, while maintaining, developing, and improving the welfare of the middle class is the core of domestic national policy. (3) Policy Issues: Recently, the government authorities have only focused on adhering to financial arrangements and have not paid attention to the implementation of national policies. The following are the strategies for balancing national defense and industry and maintaining and developing the middle class: (A) Expect the strengthening of national defense and pay special attention to its economization. (B) Seek to adjust the economy with "Manchukuo" and actively cooperate with China. (C) Establish a local financial subsidy system. (D) In order to develop industry and maintain the middle class, thoroughly lower interest rates and create diversified institutions for people's finance to expand the debt reorganization system. (E) Re-examine the expenditures of national finances, and seek to make the public bonds that must be reorganized more accessible to the people. As for the investment relations of the general financial market with Manchuria and China, efforts must also be made to adjust them. (6th Japan League Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Magazine Parodies the Japanese Emperor; Hull Regrets But Does Not Take Responsibility; Japan Has Not Yet Decided Whether to Officially Protest; Cartoonist Welcomes Japan's Entry Ban</h3>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito today negotiated with the State Department regarding a magazine cartoon, saying that the cartoon insulted the Japanese Emperor and the Japanese people. Secretary of State Hull replied that the matter was regrettable, but the US government does not have the power to censor newspapers and therefore is not responsible for any publications. Saito has not been able to declare that he will formally protest the cartoon until it has been discussed in detail in Tokyo. The Japanese seem to be dissatisfied not with the satire of the peace prize depicted in the cartoon, but with the degradation of depicting the Emperor dragging a cannon. The cartoonist is Mr. Gropper. Gropper says that the Emperor should see the other cartoons he has drawn. Newspapers carrying his cartoons have already been banned from entering several countries, including Germany. If Japan also joins the ranks of those who oppose his cartoons, he will be very happy. The opponents currently include one labor leader, several capitalists, and an emperor. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito today informally negotiated with Secretary of State Hull about the incident of an American game magazine publishing a satirical cartoon disrespectful of the Japanese Emperor. After the meeting, the Japanese Ambassador believed that he had received a direct expression of apology from Hull. However, it was also learned that Hull had tried to avoid a direct expression, only saying that he was very unhappy that the satire had been misunderstood in Japan. The official statement from the State Department stated, "When the Secretary of State replied to the Japanese Ambassador, he reported to the Ambassador that the publisher of the magazine had stated that there was no intention to offend, and that he was always unhappy about such things causing misunderstandings." According to Gropper, the artist who drew the satire, he intended to attack Japanese imperialism, and he does not care how the Japanese react. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Negotiates with South Africa to Revoke High Tariff Case</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to prevent the import of Japanese goods, the Union of South Africa has promulgated a new tariff law of three yuan, imposing heavy taxes on Japanese cotton yarn, pottery, glass, etc. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to Consul Fujimura with three major points, instructing him to contact the South African government authorities and urge them to cancel the special tariffs on Japan. The contents of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' instruction are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan is trying to adjust the one-sided trade with South Africa.</p>
<p>(2) Last year, South African wool was 20 yuan more expensive than Australian wool, and Japan was willing to suffer losses to order 20,000 bales of wool from South Africa. This was Japan's effort to adjust. This year, because the price difference is 70 yuan, it is impossible to sell more. However, 7,000 bales have already been purchased, and more purchases of South African wool are being considered next year.</p>
<p>(3) Japan has organized an export association to South Africa and is determined to implement trade restrictions.</p>
<p>Japan urges the South African authorities to reflect on these three points and abolish the new tariff rules. (6th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Strengthening Pacific Defense: US Congressman Urges Authorities to Proceed</h3>

<h3>Britain Must Strengthen its Navy to Maintain World Peace: Declaration by the British Secretary of the Navy</h3>
<p>(London) Secretary of the Navy Monsell recently gave a speech at the Conservative Party meeting in Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, stating, "Britain must strengthen the efficiency of its navy so that collective security, once threatened, can be upheld by Britain. The British Empire occupies a quarter of the Earth's land surface, and its security depends on the British Navy everywhere. Therefore, the British Navy has an unshirkable responsibility to maintain world peace." (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Economist Speculates on the Future Situation; Germany Does Not Forget its Invasion of Russia</h3>
<p>(London) A renowned British economist and former advisor to the British Treasury, Keynes, gave a speech at Oxford University today, stating that Italy's militaristic actions today are the result of the Italian people's suffering. However, the more dangerous country is Germany. Germany will inevitably become a militaristic country sooner or later. Judging from Hitler's repeated declarations, Germany has never forgotten its desire to seize part of Soviet Russia. Keynes then warned all countries that if this policy continues, revolutions will inevitably occur in all countries, including Britain. Therefore, Britain's position today is extremely dangerous. Keynes predicted the unprecedented global economic depression in March 1929, and by the end of that year, American stock prices had indeed plummeted. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British War Veterans Who Visited Germany Return Home and State: This Trip Cannot Be Seen as an Endorsement of German Policy</h3>
<p>(London) Major General Gortley, Chairman of the British War Veterans Association, led a delegation of British war veterans to Germany last month for a visit. Upon their return, 700 British war veterans gathered today to welcome them. Gortley gave a speech, stating, "We met repeatedly with representatives of the German government in Germany, but based on the facts, this meeting should not be seen as British war veterans endorsing the policies of the German government, nor should it be seen as a relationship between the British war veterans group and the German government. We gained a lot during our travels in Germany. This experience will be very useful. It should be known that the governments of all countries in the world are genuinely committed to peace and do not risk the collapse of their government positions. I believe that we have now opened the way for peace efforts and achieved success. I dare to believe that German war veterans all agree to be friends with us." Finally, he stated the British war veterans' attitude towards war, saying, "We only support honorable peace. We will never support peace at any cost." (5th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) British veterans met today in Thai Chiang. Major Gortley, who recently visited Germany, spoke, saying that his experience during this visit was extremely valuable, because not only did German veterans want to gain British friendship, but the entire German people also had this feeling.

<h3>Mexico's Land Lease to the US Issue: Abolished as Early as 1933</h3>
<p>Mexico City: Rumors are circulating that the Mexican government will lease the Magdalena Bay area in Baja California to the United States. Regarding this matter, responsible sources recently stated that the land was not leased to the US government, but to a private individual in Kansas City, USA. Furthermore, the lease contract was declared invalid as early as 1933. However, the declaration only took effect today. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Mexico City: Rumors are circulating that the Mexican government's representatives have leased coastal land in Baja California to private American businesses. The Mexican federal government has recently declared that the lease is illegal. The leased area extends approximately 25 kilometers from the Pacific coast of Baja California inland, including Magdalena Bay, considered an important strategic location, and Margarita Island, from the port of San Jose to the area north of Coma Coma, an area inhabited by Mexican immigrants and where federal troops are stationed and roads are built. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) A State Department spokesman recently stated, "The State Department is unaware of any lease of land in Baja California on the Pacific coast by the Mexican government to the United States. Although there are rumors that the United States is seeking to obtain this leasehold to use as a naval base if necessary, the United States government does not have any leasehold rights in the Magdalena Bay area. Such rumors in Mexico City may be due to the Mexican authorities granting such leasehold rights to private American individuals or companies, but the State Department is unaware of such matters."

<h3>The Poland-Danzig Issue</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The Danzig City Senate recently ordered that certain goods be allowed to enter duty-free. The Polish government has protested this matter. The first batch of duty-free goods from Germany recently arrived in Danzig. Although Polish customs officials protested, they were eventually allowed to enter. People in Warsaw have been strongly impressed by this matter. The Polish government believes that the measures adopted by the Danzig authorities conflict with existing treaties. However, until now, no retaliatory measures have been taken. It is likely that efforts will first be made to persuade Danzig to revoke the duty-free order. If this is ineffective, then measures will be determined. However, regarding this matter, Danzig Senate President Greiser stated in his response to the Polish protest that he does not intend to change his attitude. Therefore, the cancellation of the duty-free order is not necessarily certain. It is rumored that the Polish government closed the border between Poland and Danzig for two days, but this is now known to be untrue. Furthermore, Polish Commissioner to Danzig Pope returned to the country to consult with the government on the duty-free measures. He has now returned to his post after completing his official duties. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw: According to a semi-official Polish newspaper, Poland recently proposed to Danzig that it provide food to Danzig as a long-term loan, but this was rejected by Greiser, President of the Free City Senate. The newspaper believes that the friction between Poland and the Free City has political implications, which can be proven by Greiser's rejection of Poland's proposal. According to the People's Voice, the organ of the Danzig Socialist Party, food prices in the Free City have skyrocketed, with some items being twice as high as in nearby Gdynia, Poland.

<h3>Change of Governor-General of India</h3>
<p>(London) The term of office of the Governor-General of India, Lord Willingdon, is coming to an end. It is heard that the successor has now been appointed as Marquess of Linlithgow.

Two years ago, he was appointed Chairman of the Indian Constitutional Reform Committee. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US House Passes Wealth Tax Bill</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the House of Representatives passed President Roosevelt's wealth tax bill by a vote of 282 to 96.

The bill is largely in line with Roosevelt's original proposal, except that the income of charitable organizations is exempt by five percent. (5th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Senator Goes to Europe</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pope, a Democrat from Idaho and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is scheduled to depart for Europe next Sunday. He plans to visit the capitals of London, Paris, Geneva, and Rome. Therefore, there are widespread rumors that Pope's trip is a semi-official observer dispatched by the State Department regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Although this rumor has been denied by Secretary of State Hull, judging by Pope's important position in the Democratic Party, the purpose of this trip is likely not insignificant. The US government has always wanted to pay close attention to the development of the Italo-Abyssinian issue. Pope's trip is sufficient to fulfill this desire of the government. As for what Pope has announced, he said, "I will take advantage of my trip to Geneva to attend the League of Nations General Assembly in a private capacity and plan to meet with French Prime Minister Laval, Italian Premier Mussolini, British Prime Minister Baldwin, British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. It is also possible that I will travel to the capital of Abyssinia." (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Average Lifespan of Japanese People Still Has Not Reached 50 Years</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Cabinet Statistics Bureau announced the latest survey on the lifespan of Japanese people on the 6th. It is said that since ancient times, "life is no more than fifty years" has become a popular saying. However, in reality, the average lifespan of Japanese men is only slightly less than 45 years, and the average lifespan of Japanese women is only slightly less than 47 years, which is still far from the "fifty years" of lifespan mentioned in the saying. Compared to the previous announcement, the lifespan of men is shortened every year, but women live longer than men. The death rate of Japanese people is the highest compared to countries such as England, America, Germany, France, and Italy, indicating that the health condition of the Japanese people is still inferior. In particular, the high mortality rate in infancy is even more noteworthy. (6th Japan League Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Our Side Considers Developing Resources in North China</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military Attaché Takahashi of the Japanese Embassy visited Shang Zhen in Baoding and then Yan Xishan in Taiyuan. He returned to Beiping on the 5th. According to sources, Takahashi's visit to Shang and Yan was to explain Japan's current views on the situation in North China and its policies for developing resources in North China. However, it is understood that Takahashi did not formally raise the issue of industrial development in North China during his visit to Shang, nor did he engage in any discussions. The current authorities, due to the excessive need for funds for this issue, especially the construction of the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang and other railway lines, which is not an easy task, will carefully consider it before starting. Rumors of a decision already being reached are inaccurate. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jones Still in Bandit Hands</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, the kidnapped British journalist Jones is currently being held by bandits in the Fengning County border area of Rehe. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jones is expected to escape from the bandit den within about one or two days. The German journalist Miller, who went to Shichang to assist in the rescue, has completed his mission and is scheduled to return to Beiping tonight from Zhangjiakou. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a telephone call from Zhangjiakou at noon on the 6th, British journalist Jones is still not out of danger. Negotiators from the Chahar Provincial Government are currently in contact with the bandits. Although the 6th was the last day for the bandits' ransom deadline, the continuous heavy rain in Chahar Province has made transportation very inconvenient, causing some difficulties in the negotiations. The bandits are also well aware of this, so even though the deadline has passed, they are unlikely to immediately kill Jones. It is expected that there will be results in a few days. It is reported that the bandits have moved Jones to a secret location. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) German journalist Muller, who went to Zhangjiakou to assist the Chahar authorities in rescuing British journalist Jones, returned to Beiping at 7 pm on the 6th. According to him, Jones has now been moved by the bandits to Fengning County, Rehe. With Jones in Rehe, the Chahar authorities are finding it difficult to proceed. They are now planning to contact Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, for joint handling by both China and Japan. It is reported that the Japanese side has expressed agreement. It is expected that Jones will be out of danger within one or two days. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The rumor that Jones was abducted by bandits into Rehe has now been confirmed. Dr. Muller, a German journalist, arrived in Zhangjiakou tonight and stated that the ransom of 8,000 yuan has been sent to Baochang, but the bandits did not accept it and suddenly abducted Jones into Rehe. Matsui, a Japanese military officer in Zhangjiakou, told Dr. Muller that Jones has indeed entered Rehe and that the Japanese side can find a way to rescue him and send him back to Beiping within one or two days. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that Jones, a reporter guided by the Manchester Guardian, has been abducted by bandits into Rehe. Some say that the negotiations between the Chinese government representative and the bandits have broken down, while others say that the negotiations have not only not broken down but that a ransom of 20,000 yuan was paid yesterday. Jones may be free on Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning. The news from all sides is highly contradictory. Jones has been abducted for ten days, but everyone believes that the bandits will not harm him. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yan Xishan Advocates Inter-Provincial Exchange of Goods</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Taiyuan, believes that since most of Shanxi's commercial goods come from outside the province, it leads to annual trade deficits. When Shanxi people's overseas business was developed, there was an inflow of forty to fifty million in working capital, so it could barely be supported. Recently, the sharp decrease in foreign exchange has caused the province's economy to be extremely exhausted. In addition to issuing local currency in the province to promote the purchase of provincial goods, he is also implementing inter-provincial exchange of goods. He has dispatched technician Ye from the Construction Department to the south to first contact the Zhejiang Provincial Government to exchange Shanxi's wool, sheepskin, carpets, and all other handmade specialty products for Zhejiang's silk and low-priced daily necessities. After the two parties negotiate a compromise, Ye will go to Zhenjiang to contact the Jiangsu Construction Department. However, the categories still need to be inspected by both parties based on their needs before opening a list for mutual reference.

<h3>Large-Scale Bandit Suppression in Hebei Province Liu Guitang's Bandits Harass the War Zone</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In the past month, due to the changes in the political situation in Hebei, the troop movements, and the emptiness of local defenses, and at a time when green gauze screens are rising, bandits in various places have taken the opportunity to become active. The bandit atmosphere is particularly strong in Wen'an, Baxian, Anci, Jinghai, Renqiu, and other counties. The bandits often rely on dense reeds as a barrier, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and repeatedly suppressing police groups. Dong Ze's gang in Wen'an and Baxian has gathered as many as a thousand people. Since mid-last month, they have resisted the bandit suppression troops, and the problem has not yet been resolved. Recently, the Tang and Liang regiments of the 141st Division of the 32nd Army, together with the militia of Wen'an and Baxian counties, have divided into nine routes, surrounding the reed pond where Dong's bandits are hiding, and implementing a long-term encirclement method to starve the bandits. They also gathered brave civilians to cut down the reeds, so that the bandits lose their barrier, in order to sweep them away in one fell swoop. Therefore, this branch of bandits is difficult to pacify effectively in a short time. Shengfang Town, Jinghai County, was also occupied by bandits before. Up until last week, the Five Rivers Water Public Security Bureau dispatched over twenty patrol boats, and the Song Division troops of the 32nd Army attacked by land and water, and the bandits began to flee along the South Canal, abandoning over twenty hostages. They were escorted back to their hometowns by the military police. However, although the bandits fled, their strength has not been eliminated. There have been reports recently that they are entrenched in Yangliuqing. The province plans to divide the entire province into three areas (excluding the war zone) and search and suppress them along the east, south, and west routes. The east area is centered on Jinghai, Wen'an, Baxian, Renqiu, and other counties. The west area is centered on Huolu, Lingshou, and Quyang. The south area is centered on Daming, Xingtai, and Handan. The 32nd Army of Shang Zhen's department will dispatch two divisions to cooperate with the local security teams and militia, and be organized into three major guerrilla teams, under the command of the Provincial Security Office. Shang Zhen also plans to personally command one area when necessary, along with Li Peiji, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Li Xingcun, Deputy Director of the Provincial Security Office, leading the team to suppress them. Currently, in all 130 counties of Hebei Province, the bandit atmosphere is rampant in over sixty counties. There has been excessive rainfall this year, and the rivers have overflowed. If the bandits are not suppressed, everyone will hardly survive.</p>
<p>The bandits in the war zone have also suddenly become active in the past half month. Outside the various passes of the Great Wall, bandits have gathered four to five thousand people. They recently attacked Taipingzhai and Luotun, near Qian'an County, and Walong Mountain in Lulong County. Even Panjiakou and Xifengkou were once occupied by bandits. Zhang Yantian, the commander of the Second Security Brigade, was ordered to lead his troops to suppress them. However, the bandits are rampant and numerous, and they flee as they are suppressed, so they have not been successful. Yin Rugeng, the Administrative Inspector of the Lianyuyu District, plans to convene a meeting of the heads of the security brigades and county magistrates in the jurisdiction after taking office, and then decide on a large-scale clean-up method. However, the bandits in that area are the old troops of Liu Guitang, who have been secretly training outside the pass for half a year. They are currently commanded by Bai Jianwu and Lin Yulin. There are also many near Xinglong Ping'an Fort and Gubeikou. The team of Liu Guitang hiding between Yuguan and Shihe has about six to seven hundred persons. The bandits claimed to have obtained the understanding of the Japanese Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison and intend to occupy the war zone, so they openly unveiled the false flag of the "North China Autonomous National Salvation Army". The firearms are well equipped, and there are heavy weapons such as machine guns and field guns. The Gubeikou Japanese military Kawakishi Brigade Headquarters specifically ordered staff officer Harada last week to visit Huo Shi, director of the Gubeikou Office of the Jimi Administrative Region, and deliver a statement, which stated, "Liu Bai and other troublemakers hold business cards of our army's officers and are using our army's name, and there are Japanese ronin participating in it, claiming to have contacted the enemy army. After investigation, it is confirmed that they have absolutely no relationship with our Tianjin Garrison and the Kwantung Army. Our army is extremely indignant about this. Please take decisive measures and thoroughly suppress these troublemakers who obstruct Sino-Japanese relations. In the event that your special police force is weak, please notify our army to jointly assist in the suppression, so as to thoroughly eliminate the troublemakers who obstruct Sino-Japanese relations."

<h3>Western River Counties of Guangdong Province: Rushing to Build Autumn Embankments After the Disaster, Engaging in Autumn Cultivation to Maintain Food Supply, and Distributing Relief Funds to Provide Work Relief</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The counties in the western part of Guangdong Province, which suffered from flooding, are now seeing the floodwaters receding daily. However, handling the aftermath requires financial resources everywhere. In addition to raising funds for immediate relief, the relief committees in various counties are also urgently planning to build autumn embankments to address concerns about food shortages. They aim to repair breaches in the dikes and embankments of farmland in the disaster areas to facilitate timely autumn cultivation, thereby preventing a complete failure of the late rice crop. The dike repair project will also employ a large number of refugees, providing work relief, which is a win-win situation. Therefore, rushing to build autumn embankments in the disaster areas is currently a top priority. However, initiating construction projects requires funding, and the county relief committees have repeatedly appealed to the government for the prompt allocation of relief funds to enable these projects. Finally, on July 30th, the provincial government approved the distribution plan for the Northwest River flood relief funds. The Finance Department will allocate 100,000 yuan as requested, instructing each county to send representatives to the provincial capital to receive the funds. According to the distribution plan, Gaoyao County is allocated 20,000 yuan, with 18,000 yuan for building autumn embankments and roads, and the remaining 2,000 yuan for direct relief. Sihui County receives 20,000 yuan, with 15,000 yuan for building autumn embankments and roads, and the remaining 5,000 yuan for direct relief. Gaoming County receives 14,000 yuan, with 12,000 yuan for building embankments and roads, and 2,000 yuan for direct relief. Guangning County receives 14,000 yuan, with 11,000 yuan for repairing embankments and subsidizing house construction, and 2,000 yuan for direct relief. Sanshui County receives 5,000 yuan, with 4,000 yuan for building embankments and roads, and 1,000 yuan for direct relief. Qingyuan County receives 5,000 yuan, allocated in the same manner as Sanshui. Nanhai County receives 4,000 yuan, with 3,000 yuan for building embankments and roads, and 1,000 yuan for direct relief. Yingde, Yangshan, and Heshan counties each receive 2,500 yuan. Deqing, Huaxian, Yunan, Yunfu, Fengchuan, Wengyuan, and Qujiang counties each receive 1,500 yuan, allocated for repairing embankments, building roads, and direct relief. Furthermore, the Ren'ai Shantang charity recently noted that Shunde County is suffering from the decline of the silk industry, rural bankruptcy, and the impact of the floods, leaving the poor with no means of livelihood. Major surnames and clans in Daliang and Chencun have already begun providing affordable grain and distributing porridge. Concerned for the disaster victims, the Shantang also allocated 2,000 yuan in relief funds and sent representatives to the county to discuss relief distribution methods with the county government (July 31st).</p>

<p>Kunshan: Smuggling Opium Dealer Captured and Escaped En Route</p>
<p>Since Kunshan County began enforcing the opium ban, it has been very strict in arresting opium dealers. However, these people, driven by profit, are willing to break the law. A guest merchant named Zhu Haichun, who lived in the Likujie Street behind the county government, specialized in smuggling opium. Zhang Da, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, learned of this and, on the 5th at 11:00 PM, ordered Fang Zheng, the leader of the detective team, to lead four detectives to arrest him. Zhu was already asleep at the time and was easily captured. The police also found two large packages of cooked opium. The police handcuffed Zhu and took him to the bureau for processing. However, when they reached the Phoenix Bridge, the suspect took advantage of the police's inattention and escaped without a trace. The police urgently searched everywhere and fired shots to warn him, but were unable to recapture him. As a result, Zhu's wife was detained at the bureau pending further action. Today, detectives have been dispatched to various locations to strictly apprehend the suspect, but it is unknown whether they will be successful.</p>
<p>Newspaper Office Vandalized</p>
<p>The Kunshan Dan Bao newspaper, which has been published for only five months, has changed ownership twice due to financial difficulties. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Jin Fangliu, the former editor-in-chief of the newspaper, along with Zou De, a staff member of the science laboratory, Chen Zheng, a teacher from a certain school, and two servants, went to the newspaper office to argue with the publisher, Lu Jiandan. Lu was not there at the time, so Jin and the others vandalized the office, tearing up various manuscripts and removing the sign at the entrance. After a while, Lu returned to the office and learned of what had happened. He immediately reported the incident to the County Public Security Bureau, who sent police to investigate. It is said that the incident was due to a dispute over investment funds, leading to this act of anger.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Suzhou-Kunshan Highway Scheduled to Open</p>

They are smaller than the larger Mengtian trucks, with 15 passenger seats per vehicle. Shen Shaozeng has been appointed as the station manager of the Kunshan station. The opening of the entire highway will be implemented after consultation with the Shanghai Municipal Government, which should not be far off.</p>
<p>Suzhou-Wuxi Highway Planned for Construction</p>

The construction bureaus of both counties have already begun surveying and are preparing detailed plans and budgets to be submitted to the province for approval. Construction is expected to begin after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Yesterday (the 6th), the Construction Department specially sent engineer Wu Zuoting to Suzhou to discuss the project with Zhou, the director of the Construction Bureau. It is said that Wu will begin organizing the Suzhou-Wuxi Road Engineering Office, stationed in Changzhou and Zhenjiang, to oversee the construction.</p>
<p>Throwing Soil at Train Case Referred to Zhenjiang for Strict Handling</p>
<p>The case of throwing soil at a train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, after the arrest of the main suspects Xue Songshan, Wang A'er, Liu Ziyang, and Chen Yinsheng (the owner of the Qingji soil shop, also known as Qian Qing), has attracted widespread attention. The suspects have now been sent to the county for transfer to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command for strict handling. Whether the driver and crew of the train were aware of the incident also needs to be investigated. Therefore, the County Anti-Opium Committee has sent a letter to the management of both railways, requesting them to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Actively Kills Stray Dogs</p>
<p>The problem of capturing stray dogs in Suzhou has been reduced since the Public Security Bureau began actively killing them on the 1st of this month. To facilitate the registration of domestic dogs, the deadline for supplementary registration has been extended by ten days. At the same time, a religious philosophical society has launched an animal protection association, appealing to the authorities to slow down the capture. Amidst the dispute over whether human life or dog life is more important, an apprentice at a wonton shop in Dongzhong Market was bitten by a domestic dog. The stray dogs that have not been killed are still rampant, and even domestic dogs with registration tags around their necks are lying on the streets, barking at people. As of yesterday (the 6th), the preparatory committee of the animal protection association has decided to set up a shelter at Xiajin Bridge, build straw sheds, and discuss management methods. It has also submitted a request to the authorities to capture dogs alive and send them to the shelter for adoption. Meanwhile, the Public Security Bureau has decided that all registered domestic dogs must have their owners purchase and wear muzzles, otherwise they will still be captured and killed.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Silk Market Soars, Work Intensifies</p>
<p>Recently, the overseas silk market has seen a decrease in Japanese silk production, leading to higher silk prices. European and American foreign firms are increasingly ordering Chinese silk because of its soft texture and lower price. Silk factories in Shanghai are busy processing and reeling silk. More than thirty factories in Wuxi have started production, accounting for one-third of the total number of factories. Currently, 85-point Imenna silk can be sold for around 500 yuan, and 83-point old silk can also be sold for 470-480 yuan. Household silk is currently priced at 440 yuan, more than 100 yuan higher than when it was at its lowest. As a result, the price of dry cocoons has also risen, with the highest price being 180 yuan. In the past few days, Shanghai factories have come to Wuxi to purchase 780 bales of spring dry cocoons, priced at 180 to 165 yuan. The Wuxi Silk Factory Association held an extraordinary meeting yesterday to resolve the following: (1) Since August 1st, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has canceled the freight cars attached to the early passenger trains, which greatly hinders the silk being sent to the Silk Inspection Bureau and delivered to foreign firms. The bureau will be asked to restore the original situation. (2) The Shanghai industry will be consulted to reduce silk sales commissions and ensure strict compliance. (3) There are inconsistencies in the wages and working hours of female workers in various factories. A uniform method should be established. It was decided that starting this month, the standard wage for silk reeling workers will be 42 cents, and those who were previously paid 30 cents will switch to full-time work starting from the 7th. The working hours will be uniformly set as starting work at 5:00 AM and stopping work at 6:30 PM, with a 15-minute break for breakfast and a one-hour break for lunch.</p>
<p>Meijing Township Police and Bandits Engage in Fierce Battle</p>
<p>The farmer brothers Qian Chunqiu and Chunhua from Shanglouxia Township, Meijing, in the tenth district of the county, recently received association funds, which attracted the attention of bandits. At 11:00 PM the night before last, six bandits suddenly arrived and broke into their house. Three bandits carried box cannons, two carried pistols, and the rest carried iron rods. They tied up the Chunqiu and Chunhua brothers, forcing them to reveal where the silver was hidden. They then robbed 13 silver dollars and over 20,000 copper coins, as well as gold jewelry and clothing, from the room of Chunqiu's mother, Zhou.

At the time, it was dark and they could not be pursued. Yesterday, they reported the incident to the county for arrest.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor, having read Mr. Zhou Xuewen's letter in your newspaper on August 3, which mentions "the lingering heartache of the missionary Bu," I must clarify that the funeral arrangements were discussed and agreed upon by the board of directors of the Orphanage for Poor Children and the Jiazi War Disaster Memorial Association beforehand. It was agreed that the condolence money received would be split equally between the two parties. As a result, the Jiazi War Disaster Memorial Association received 621 yuan, which will be used to rebuild the memorial pavilion. I have not interfered in this matter in any way. There is no so-called heartache. Fearing that the outside world may misunderstand the facts, I hereby make this statement. Please accept this for your esteemed consideration, O great editor of the Shen Bao. Respectfully submitted, William Brewster, missionary.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers in the French Concession Clash with Vietnamese Police Yesterday – Twelve Injured, One Missing, Three Vietnamese Police Injured – Over 40,000 Rickshaw Pullers Strike, Rickshaws Disappear from Shanghai South</h3>
<p>Over 40,000 rickshaw pullers in the Shanghai West and Shanghai South districts of this city, in opposition to registration by the French Concession, suddenly declared a general strike yesterday morning, clashing with Vietnamese police. One rickshaw puller is missing, twelve were injured, and three Vietnamese police were also injured. There were also incidents of tires being deflated along the way. Party and government organs, as well as Du Yuesheng, mediated again, but without effect. The trade association will hold a representatives' meeting today, and the rickshaw pullers will petition today, worsening the situation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>General Strike</p>
<p>Over 40,000 rickshaw pullers in the French Concession, in opposition to the registration by the French Municipal Council, had repeatedly held meetings to protest. Mediation by party and government organs, as well as Du Yuesheng and others, proved ineffective due to the French authorities' firm stance and refusal to change the registration principles. Therefore, at a representatives' meeting the night before last, it was decided to declare a general strike at 6:00 AM yesterday morning as an effective countermeasure. The trade association tried to prevent it, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Clash Occurs</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, over 1,500 representatives of the striking rickshaw pullers set off in a group from the Great South Gate to petition the city Party headquarters, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, the police department, the Municipal Council, and the Second Special District Citizens' Association. Unexpectedly, when they reached Xie Bridge, Vietnamese police prevented the rickshaw pullers from passing. A verbal argument ensued, and the Vietnamese police then fired shots into the air as a warning. The rickshaw pullers, angered and agitated, clamored loudly, and the Vietnamese police used guns to beat and drive the rickshaw pullers away, resulting in many injuries. Three cars from the Lou Jia Wan police station, with both Chinese and foreign police, rushed into the Chinese territory.</p>
<p>Injured Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>As a result of the clash, rickshaw puller representative Xue San (also known as Ru Ji) is missing and has not been found as of late at night. The injured are: (1) Zhang Jia-mang (32 years old, from Taizhou, head and waist injuries); (2) Han Chang-sheng (28 years old, from Dongtai, leg and waist injuries). The above two are seriously injured and are at the Shanghai Hospital at the San Tai Wharf. (3) Zhao Zheng-yu (18 years old, from Taixing, head injury); (4) Wu Jin-fa (35 years old, from Yancheng, hand injury); (5) Chen Xi-wen (42 years old, from Taixian, head injury); (6) Lu Wen-sheng (34 years old, from Fu Rong, chest injury); (7) Lou Ai-shu (36 years old, from Taixian, waist injury); (8) Li Zi-qing (32 years old, from Fu Ning, head injury); (9) Hu Wen-sheng (22 years old, from Yancheng, leg injury); (10) Ma Yi-qing (36 years old, from Fu Ning, chest injury); (11) Tang Fu-yin (43 years old, from Fu Ning, head injury); (12) Wang An-sheng (19 years old, from Yancheng, chest injury). The above ten were bandaged and discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Police Cross the Border</p>
<p>At that time, the head Vietnamese police officer No. 173, along with police officers No. 223 and No. 440, crossed the border to pursue the rickshaw pullers, resulting in the loss of a pistol, No. 245644, belonging to police officer No. 170 of the Er Dao Tou and a rifle, No. 11414, belonging to a Chinese police officer, as well as eight bullets, during the chaos. They were later found by police officers from the Ximen Branch at the intersection of Lu Jia Bang and Lin Yin Road and retrieved by the French police station with a letter. At the time, three Vietnamese police officers were beaten and sent to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. During the clash, trams on lines 10, 6, 17, and 18 of the French Concession were blocked. The glass and other parts of tram No. 20 on line 6 were smashed.</p>
<p>Discussing Response</p>
<p>Because of the tragedy, the rickshaw pullers were filled with indignation and immediately convened an emergency representatives' meeting. It was decided to send six representatives – Xu Hongsheng, Zhou Yongcai, Li A-si, Zhou Li, Yang Yougui, and Wu Yigao – to lead 800 other representatives to petition various party and government organs and French Concession community organizations in the afternoon, demanding: (1) cancellation of registration; (2) punishment of the perpetrators; (3) compensation for losses. However, due to insufficient time to prepare the petition and other procedures, the petition was postponed to this morning.</p>
<p>Requesting Negotiations</p>
<p>After the strike broke out yesterday morning, rickshaw owners reported to the trade association, requesting serious negotiations with the French authorities. Therefore, the association specially sent executive members Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, and Song Yaokun to report the situation to Du Yuesheng, the Chinese director of the French Municipal Council, requesting renewed mediation. After the tragedy occurred at 9:00 AM, Yu Dajin was also sent to see Du Yuesheng, requesting that he stop the violence. Du Yuesheng agreed to visit the French consul to seek correction. As a result, the French consul believed that with three police officers injured, there was no room for reversal.</p>
<p>French Consul Negotiates</p>
<p>After the incident, Baudesson, the acting French Consul-General in Shanghai, drove to the city center at 11:30 AM to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng and make representations. However, Mayor Wu stated that he would thoroughly investigate the rickshaw pullers' petition and the Vietnamese police's shooting before deciding on a concrete plan of action.</p>
<p>Party and Government Investigation</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, party and government organs, considering the seriousness of the situation, sent Cao Peizi and Dai Youheng, staff members from the civil training section of the city Party headquarters, and Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the third section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to the scene of the incident, the trade association hospital, and the Public Security Ximen Branch at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to investigate the truth. The rickshaw pullers knelt before the party and government representatives, begging for negotiations. The three representatives agreed to investigate and report for instructions.</p>
<p>Owners Beaten</p>
<p>Because the negotiations had not yielded results, the rickshaw pullers vented their anger on Qiu Chunshan and Zhang Huaiyang, executive members of the trade association, for their ineffective handling of the matter. The night before last, they beat the executive members at the material distribution department of the association on San Guan Tang Road. At the same time, many rickshaw owners were beaten by the rickshaw pullers, and they reported to the trade association, strongly protesting to the French police to prevent the owners from being innocently humiliated.</p>
<p>Trade Association Meeting</p>
<p>The trade association, considering the seriousness of the situation, decided to hold a meeting of rickshaw owners at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 8:00 AM this morning to discuss countermeasures. The announcement stated: "Regarding the French Concession's rickshaw registration incident, all mediation efforts have been ineffective. From today, the rickshaw pullers will refuse to pull rickshaws and will unanimously cease work. The losses to the rickshaw owners are enormous. In order to discuss countermeasures, a general meeting of rickshaw owners will be held at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium at the Tian Hou Gong Bridge at 8:00 AM tomorrow (i.e., August 7th) to discuss all courses of action. We hope that you will attend on time." According to a certain rickshaw owner, the rickshaw owners hope that the rickshaw pullers can resume work and register today. As for the registration fee of five jiao, the French Municipal Council has, in principle, agreed to reduce it, but the amount of the reduction has not yet been determined. Regardless of whether the amount is reduced or not, the rickshaw owners can be responsible for paying it in advance, which will be repaid by the rickshaw pullers in the future. Alternatively, if the French Municipal Council decides not to charge a registration fee in the future, the registration fees that have already been paid will be fully refunded. However, there can be no restrictions on the registration time, or if it must be restricted, it must be extended (according to the current regulations of the French Concession, the registration period is from July 10th to the end of the year, and the rickshaw owners suggest that it should be extended to the end of June next year).</p>
<p>Forced Deflation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the rickshaw pullers in the French Concession went on strike, rickshaws disappeared from the roads within the concession and in Xiao Zhao Hui in the Nanshi area. Rickshaws from the Public Concession flocked to the Nanshi area to operate. Upon hearing the news, the striking rickshaw pullers sent out many people to order the deflation of the tires of the rickshaws. As a result, trams and public buses operated by Chinese merchants, as well as trams and public buses operated by French merchants, saw their business triple.</p>
<p>Owners' Statement</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the rickshaw owners' association yesterday, since the entire body of rickshaw pullers unanimously protested and expressed opposition to the French Concession's rickshaw registration, the rickshaw owners, in addition to mediating, have conveyed the rickshaw pullers' demands and have been running around negotiating and appealing for help. Thanks to the mediation of representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau, as well as Mr. Du Yuesheng, but the French Concession authorities insisted on the established methods and refused to adopt public opinion or make appropriate revisions. They also used high-pressure tactics, seizing large numbers of rickshaws, detaining them in police stations, and using police vehicles to capture rickshaw pullers along the way and force them to register. These harsh measures not only disregarded our national sovereignty but also directly treated our Chinese people as slaves of a conquered nation. The association is heartbroken to witness this situation. The rickshaw owners have consistently advised the rickshaw pullers to wait patiently for mediation. At 3:00 PM yesterday (the 5th), the association reported the progress of the negotiations to the rickshaw pullers on San Guan Tang Road and again advised the rickshaw pullers to remain calm and make concessions in the spirit of prioritizing harmony. Unexpectedly, some rickshaw pullers were unable to understand the association's painstaking efforts to seek compromise and safeguard the overall situation, and they even beat the association's executive members Zhang Huaiyang and Qiu Chunshan on the spot, which is deeply regrettable. The association's two executive members, Zhang and Qiu, believe that their suffering is a sacrifice for the public good, and the rickshaw pullers who resorted to violence did so because they were forced by livelihood issues, which is understandable, so they have expressed their unwillingness to pursue the matter in order to show the rickshaw owners' and rickshaw pullers' sincere cooperation. However, the rickshaw pullers, considering their own livelihood and to help the rickshaw pullers who were forced to become unemployed, unanimously refused to pull rickshaws from this morning to show their resistance. The first to bear the brunt is the rickshaw owners. It is estimated that the rickshaw owners will suffer losses of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per day of the strike. In addition to urging Mr. Du Yuesheng to continue to mediate, the association also advises the rickshaw pullers to resume work as soon as possible so that traffic between the Chinese and French areas will not be affected. However, the association will not be responsible for any unexpected actions taken by the rickshaw pullers during this strike due to excessive pressure.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Silk Factory Resumes Work - A Few Workers South of the Railway Have Not Entered the Factory - Full Resumption of Work Expected from Today</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the eighteen silk factories in the Zhabei area, after the strike that began on the morning of the 3rd, had the details of the investigation promptly dispatched by party and government organs. It was originally scheduled to resume work uniformly yesterday morning, but some workers in the silk factories south of the railway had not yet entered the factory yesterday morning. The capital side hopes that this matter can be resolved as soon as possible, as the silk factories have suffered from the impact of the economic downturn in recent years and are showing signs of decline. The silk industry is slightly better this year than in previous years. If both labor and capital can overcome difficulties together and cooperate wholeheartedly, the future of the silk industry may be saved. The party and government authorities are currently making every effort to mediate, and it is likely that full resumption of work will be achieved starting today.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Tianjin Press Circles Telegraph the Central Government - for Reconsideration and Amendment of the Publication Law - Shanghai Daily Press Association Unanimously Agrees</h3>
<p>Since the amendment to the Publication Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan, news circles in various places have felt that it imposes too many restrictions and is unlikely to be implemented. They have repeatedly telegraphed the central government, requesting that principles be reconsidered and referred for reconsideration. The Shanghai Daily Press Association yesterday received a telegram from the press circles of Guangdong and Tianjin, expressing their sympathy and unanimous agreement in order to achieve the goal of reconsideration. The two telegrams are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Tianjin</p>
<p>Shanghai Daily Press Association, the Ma telegram has been received. The new Publication Law is strictly restrictive and has many obstacles. It is unconventional and does not conform to public opinion. It is difficult to remain silent. Your association is following the requests of colleagues in various places and making firm and powerful claims. The news has spread, and everyone sympathizes. In addition to telegramming the Central Political Council, requesting that it accept public opinion, reconsider the principles, and refer them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration, we hereby reply. Tianjin Newspaper Trade Association bows, Trap.</p>
<p>Guangdong</p>
<p>Shanghai Daily Press Association to all newspapers, news agencies, and publishing circles nationwide, We hereby transmit a telegram to the National Government, which reads, "To the National Government, The Legislative Yuan has passed the amended Publication Law, which has many changes compared to the current law. Colleagues in various places have requested a delay in promulgation. The association has also held a meeting and believes that with the amended draft, the competent authorities in the publishing industry, the county government, or the Social Affairs Bureau directly under the Executive Yuan, have the power to detain and punish. We dare not be sure that they will be fair, which is enough to give corrupt officials the power to control public opinion and obliterate social justice. Furthermore, both Article 14 of the current law and the same article of the amended draft stipulate that corrections or rebuttals should be published in full and should correspond to the original text. This has always been the most difficult thing for the news industry. Now the amendment maintains the status quo without improvement. In the future, the pages of newspapers will be filled with lengthy corrections or rebuttals, losing their function, which is not the government's intention to support the news industry. Furthermore, the newly added Article 21 of the amended draft, "Private or family privacy events shall not be published," has a vague meaning and lacks clear standards. If an individual's behavior affects social order, then the person's good and evil deeds should be recorded and criticized by society in good faith. If all publications are prohibited, it will only encourage the evil habits of traitors and criminals and will not help to conceal evil and promote good. As for the third chapter, which stipulates inspection measures for books and other publications, newspapers are not mentioned, leading to nowhere to turn. Inspections and detentions vary from place to place. News operators have lost their principles to follow, and those who implement it have no standards, which will inevitably plunge the national news industry into a state of dying, and the future of culture is unthinkable. After careful consideration, we believe that it is difficult to implement. In addition to jointly requesting the Central Political Council to formulate new principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration, we hereby telegraphically submit to your government, respectfully requesting a delay in promulgation in order to maintain the freedom of speech and publication, which is for the public good. Guangdong Press Association, Guangdong Provincial Journalists Association Joint Committee, Guangzhou Journalists Association, Trap," We hereby transmit this message, hoping that everyone will agree and achieve this goal.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau - Issues Funds to Assist Overseas Chinese - Three Yuan Per Person Distributed at the Jiangxi Guild Hall - Overseas Chinese from Wenzhou Scheduled to Return Home Tonight by Ship</h3>
<p>Seventy-four overseas Chinese, including Hu Junmin, who were forced to return from Japan, have been petitioning the Municipal Government's Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and other organs for days due to livelihood difficulties, requesting assistance. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, out of concern for the overseas Chinese, specially issued temporary relief funds of three yuan per person yesterday. The overseas Chinese are scheduled to return to their hometown tonight by ship. The following are the details obtained by the reporter of the Industrial and Commercial Society:</p>
<p>Government Assistance</p>
<p>Because of their livelihood difficulties, the overseas Chinese went to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to request assistance. The bureau considered this matter to be of great importance and telegraphed the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for instructions. According to Liu Zhuchu of the bureau, the bureau originally had a temporary fee of five yuan per person to assist unemployed overseas Chinese returning to the country, but due to financial constraints, it stopped issuing them in March. However, Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, believed that the current situation was special, so he instructed the bureau to approve the issuance of three yuan per person as temporary relief.</p>
<p>Distribution of Funds</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau specially appointed Tan Zhonglu, Hou Can, and Lin Zhaohong to take the funds to the Jiangxi Guild Hall in Dong Jia Du and distribute them according to the name list. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent a police officer to take care of the scene. The distribution started at 2:00 PM and ended at 5:00 PM. It is reported that after the Municipal Government received the overseas Chinese' request for assistance, it ordered the representative Hu Junmin to go to collect it this morning.</p>
<p>Returning Home Tonight</p>
<p>After receiving assistance from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, the overseas Chinese planned to return to their hometowns immediately. However, the travel expenses were huge, and they hesitated. They were given certificates by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to purchase half-price tickets as a gesture of preferential treatment. It is estimated that 51 people from Wenzhou will return to their hometowns by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan ship tonight. Several dozens of people will go to Nanjing and Ningbo to seek a living.</p>
<h3>Magistrate of Yin County - Chen Baolin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Baolin, the magistrate of Yin County, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Ningbo on the Xinningxing ship to contact the banking community in Shanghai to provide assistance to the Ningbo financial crisis. After arriving in Shanghai, he visited the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, leaders of the Ningbo gang, and responsible persons of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to negotiate everything. In order to make the parties concerned understand the details of the financial crisis in Ningbo, Magistrate Chen also hosted a reception for leaders of the Shanghai Silver Industry, the City Chamber of Commerce, and other circles at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road at 7:00 PM yesterday, including Yu Zuoting, Qin Runqing, Sun Hengfu, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, and dozens of others. Chen reported everything, and there were concrete discussions on rescue measures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché in Beijing - Amamiya Returns to Beijing Last Night - Hurried Departure and Arrival</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Amamiya, the Japanese military attaché in Nanjing, came to Shanghai by train from Beijing. He spent the whole day in Shanghai yesterday, visiting the commanders of the Japanese army and navy stationed in Shanghai and participating in a special temporary meeting of Japanese military attachés in Shanghai. After the meeting, Amamiya took the minutes of the meeting and returned to Beijing on the night express train at 11:00 PM last night.</p>
<h3>Merchant Ships on the South China Route - Seeking Shelter from the Wind Midway</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new ship, Hai Heng, sailed out of Hong Kong at 9:00 PM on the 2nd, heading back to Shanghai. After leaving Hong Kong, it encountered a hurricane along the way. It had to choose a safe place to anchor and seek shelter from the wind outside Shantou Port for two days and nights. Now that the wind has passed, it is sailing to Shanghai. The Haili ship left Shanghai for Hong Kong and Guangdong on the evening of the 3rd of this month, but when the ship reached the waters of Baiquan Island and Bullock, it encountered a hurricane.

<h3>Association to Assist Overseas Chinese in Siam - to Hold Expanded Meeting - Letters Sent to Various Organizations Asking Them to Send Personnel to Shanghai to Participate</h3>
<p>The various organizations in this port that assist the Association of Overseas Chinese in Siam believe that since the discrimination against Chinese in Siam is getting worse, our assistance to overseas Chinese in Siam must expand the organization as soon as possible and strengthen its forces to confront and negotiate with it. The seventh standing committee of the association decided to send letters to related organizations in Hong Kong, Guangdong, Fujian, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places, asking them to send personnel to Shanghai to hold an expanded meeting to assist overseas Chinese in Siam. The association has already sent out the solicitation letters yesterday. The original letter is recorded below: "Our association has been established for several months. We are extremely indignant at the Siamese government's expulsion of overseas Chinese. In addition to submitting a request to our government for stern negotiations, we have appealed to the whole country to support us. At the same time, we have contacted rice merchants in Shanghai to implement a boycott of Siamese rice in order to promote the awareness of the Siamese government. Siamese rice has long disappeared in Shanghai. However, the Siamese government is arrogant and stubborn. Not only has the treatment of our overseas Chinese not improved, but it has intensified the oppression, and harsh regulations have been added. When we think of this, we can't help but feel heartbroken. In order to achieve the goal, our association plans to expand the organization and unite the whole country to launch an initiative in order to achieve quick results. Therefore, we hereby ask your association to first unite related organizations in this port, implement a boycott of Siamese rice, and hope that you will send representatives to Shanghai to discuss the organization of a national association to assist overseas Chinese in Siam in order to show that our people's organizations have a unified action and promote the awareness of the Siamese government and abolish various harsh regulations as soon as possible, so that the various harsh regulations and oppression suffered by overseas Chinese in Siam can be lifted. The seventh standing committee is pleased to inform you".</p>

<h3>Xu Shiying: Drafts Fundamental Suggestions for Flood Control; Lengthy Document of Tens of Thousands of Words to Be Submitted to the Central Government Soon; If Implemented, Hopes to Permanently Eliminate Floods</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, our country suffers from severe floods and droughts every year, and the government and the people are engaged in rescue efforts, almost exhausting themselves. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, has returned from inspecting the disaster situation in the Yangtze River provinces this year. In addition to submitting an inspection report and detailed relief measures to the Central Government, he has also drafted a proposal for short-term and long-term disaster relief measures based on his observations. The document is tens of thousands of words long and will be submitted to the Central Government for adoption after it is finalized. The key points are to allocate funds for water conservancy projects and to control floods for disaster prevention. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying's Proposal for Flood Control and Disaster Prevention</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, in view of the vast territory of our country, the crisscrossing rivers and lakes, and the lack of proper water management, almost every province suffers from floods and droughts every year. When disasters occur, people rush to rescue and provide temporary assistance. This year, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River have again overflowed. Engaging in disaster relief is certainly an urgent task at present. In addition to these short-term measures, to plan for the future and permanently avoid disasters, it is necessary to plan ahead and develop fundamental policies for flood control and disaster prevention. Therefore, after returning to Shanghai, Xu has been thinking deeply and carefully, and to the best of his knowledge, has personally drafted a disaster relief proposal with both short-term and long-term measures. According to the Dagong News Agency reporter, the key points of the proposal are that there are numerous water conservancy agencies in our country. The government should be requested to allocate large sums of money to supervise the water conservancy agencies to recruit water conservancy experts, actively carry out water conservancy projects, dredge rivers and lakes, divert the Huai River into the sea, open up tributaries, and use the relief funds after the disaster for water management to prevent future disasters, while also benefiting agricultural irrigation. The document is tens of thousands of words long and presents thorough arguments.</p>
<h3>Submitted to the Central Government for Adoption and Implementation</h3>
<p>The content of the proposal is based on Xu's years of experience in disaster relief and his investigation into the causes of floods and droughts. It lists various short-term and long-term measures, along with notes on opinions and reasons. Because the full text is tens of thousands of words long, it has not yet been fully finalized. Xu told the Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday that the various water management plans in the proposal may seem idealistic at first glance, but they are all based on reasons and evidence, and they refer to frequent disasters in recent years, which are factual problems. He firmly believes that if this proposal can be implemented, it can permanently eliminate floods. The full text will be submitted to the Central Government for adoption as soon as it is finalized in the coming days, but because the content is of great importance, it will not be released to the public for the time being.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Implements Unified Tax; Shanghai-Based Sichuan Merchants Request Strict Prohibition of Over-Collection; Unified Tax Implemented from August 1st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Merchants Public Welfare Association, in response to the implementation of the unified tax in Sichuan Province starting this month, telegraphed the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce and the Sichuan Provincial Government, requesting them to pay attention to tax officials so as not to cause over-collection of local taxes. The two telegrams are as follows: (1) Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, Cotton Yarn and Piece Goods Industry Association, Greetings. Our Sichuan has suffered from over-collection for a long time. The Central Government and the Sichuan Provincial Government have negotiated to designate this province as a unified tax zone. The Ministry of Finance has issued an order stating that goods entering the province that have already been subject to the unified tax will be exempt from local taxes, and it is limited to implementation from August 1st. The cotton yarn and its woven products entering Sichuan should be subject to the unified tax from August 1st, and local taxes should be stopped. It can be seen that the central and local authorities are determined to reform Sichuan's administration and show consideration for the difficulties of merchants. However, the tax system relies on implementation. From that day forward, if any goods that have been transported to Chongqing and have completed the unified tax are found to be over-collected local taxes under any pretext, we hope that your association will lead the various industries to fight for it in accordance with the order and do not relax in the slightest. This matter concerns the public welfare of Sichuan merchants. In addition to telegraphing the Provincial Government to strictly prohibit over-collection of local taxes, we specially telegraph this notice. Please indicate the situation after the implementation of the unified tax. Shanghai Sichuan Merchants Public Welfare Association; (2) Telegram to the Chengdu Provincial Government, Greetings. Our Sichuan will implement the unified tax from August 1st and stop collecting local taxes, showing your government's willingness to consult with the central government, reform Sichuan's administration, and show consideration for the difficulties of merchants. However, good tax relies on implementation. We sincerely fear that local officials may not be able to fully appreciate the government's virtue when tax laws change, and may over-collect local taxes on goods that have already completed the unified tax. Please strictly prohibit it. Sichuan is fortunate, and Sichuan merchants are fortunate. Shanghai Sichuan Merchants Public Welfare Association.</p>
<h3>Drought Relief Association Requests Issuance of Tax-Exempt Passport for Relief Rice</h3>
<p>The Drought Relief Association, in order to request the National Government Relief Committee to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance for the issuance of a tax exemption for relief rice, sent a letter to the Relief Committee yesterday, stating, "We respectfully inform you that we have recently received a letter from Mr. Du Yuesheng, Executive Director of our Association, stating that he recently received a letter from the Wanchang Rice Mill, stating that the disaster victims from various provinces are coming to Shanghai in an endless stream, and those who are displaced and fleeing to various towns and villages are countless, especially in the Pudong area of Shanghai. Wherever the disaster victims go, it is difficult to buy rice, and they cannot be compared with ordinary people. Wanchang witnessed the suffering of the disaster victims and felt sad. It plans to organize relief in the Pudong area and purchase 10,000 piculs of rice to save the victims. We respectfully request that you ask the early disaster relief and relief associations in various provinces to issue tax-exempt passport papers for use. Because this matter concerns relief and is a charitable public welfare, we especially ask that you consider the factory's willingness to save the victims and approve the telegram to the National Relief Committee to quickly issue a tax-exempt passport so as to facilitate the trip, etc. Since this matter concerns the relief of disaster victims, we especially request that your committee forward a consultation to the Ministry of Finance for review and issuance. We are extremely grateful (omitted below).</p>

<p>The house at No. 6, Lane 41, Shanghai-Minhang South Extension Road, Chezhan Road, Nanshi, is rented by Dai Wang (40 years old), a widow from Nanjing, as a second landlord. Because the front and back buildings and the pavilion room had not been rented out, she posted a rental notice on the door at around 10:00 AM yesterday when two robbers with Shaoxing accents and wearing white cloth short shirts and trousers suddenly broke in, pretending to be renting the house.

<h3>Throwing Red Pills to Frame the Head of the Tu Dong</h3>
<p>Gu Zhongyu, who lives at No. 50 Shigen Lane, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai, is currently the head of the Tu Dong and squad leader of the Security Defense Post in the 29th Bao, Pushong District. He recently had a dispute over land sales in the countryside with his cousin Gu Fuquan, who is a carpenter. They filed a lawsuit in court and accumulated hatred. Gu Fuquan then colluded with Chen Aping and Wang Gensheng, who run teahouses, and Wang Xinggao (also known as Wang Jianqiu), who lives in Hongqiao Town. They discussed and agreed on the evening of the 21st of last month that Gu Fuquan would pay 10 yuan to Wang Gensheng to secretly bring two bags of pre-purchased red pills (about 2,000 pills) to Gu Zhongyu's house and hide them on the east wall shelf in the living room while people were cooling off. The next morning (22nd) at around 8:00 AM, Gu Fuquan reported to the relevant Pushong Police Station that Gu Zhongyu was selling drugs. Director Dong Xingping sent two patrol officers, Lin and Wang, to the address with Gu Fuquan to search the living room shelf. They found the red pills and took Gu Zhongyu back to the station for questioning. Gu vehemently denied the charges and insisted that Gu Fuquan had planted the evidence. The director believed that the statements were contradictory and sent a document to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for thorough investigation to clarify the truth. Since the incident occurred, the people in the West Shanghai area have been discussing it and felt unfair. Lu Ying, the chief of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Ji Puyuan, the deputy chief, also paid close attention to it. They sent Gu Liancheng, the squad leader, to the countryside for secret investigation. It was not until the night before last that ten true facts were obtained. Chen Aping and Wang Gensheng, accomplices of Gu Fuquan, were arrested, and Wang Xinggao (also known as Wang Jianqiu) had escaped. They were taken back to the team for strict questioning.

After obtaining the confession, the team leader submitted it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion of the Zhou Ruiqing's Tragic Death Case</h3>
<p>Zhou Ruiqing from Yancheng was a porter on a truck. On April 17 of this year, after finishing work, Zhou Ruiqing was cleaning the vehicle when he had an argument with Wang Yuchun, a colleague (supervisor). The two sides exchanged rude words, which led to a fight. The result was that the companions persuaded them to separate. Unexpectedly, more than ten days later, Zhou Ruiqing suddenly died.

The body of Zhou Ruiqing was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for identification and found to have died from injuries. Wang Yuchun was arrested and the case was prosecuted by Prosecutor Li Fen to the Criminal Court. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened the court for trial. First, the plaintiff Zhou Shaoting testified about the previous situation and requested a reversal of the verdict and an incidental private prosecution of 1,000 yuan. Next, the detained Wang Yuchun testified, 33 years old, said that there was an argument, but there was no fight. The deceased was standing on the car, cursing at him. Later, he did not know how he fell down and was injured. He was falsely accused of being beaten, and asked for investigation. After the witnesses testified, Prosecutor Li came to the court and made arguments. The debate lasted a long time. The interrogating official considered it to be concluded and scheduled the verdict for the 13th of this month. The defendant's lawyer requested bail. The interrogating official said that the case was of great importance and how could bail be granted? Because of the repeated requests, he was ordered to provide a reliable shop guarantee of 50,000 yuan. If there was no guarantee, he would be remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Woman's Body Found in Huangpu River Case: Court Seems to Have Obtained Clues; Prosecutor Remains Calm, Arrests Three Suspects Yesterday; Deceased Had Borrowed Money from Zhu Fuqing, Currently Involved in Litigation</h3>
<p>On the 3rd of this month at 2 PM, when the Taikoo Company's Beiyang-class Shengjing steamship was weighing anchor at Pier No. 3 for departure, the churning of the propellers brought up a female corpse with its lower body naked. The Water Police Station dispatched detectives to bring the corpse to the Southern Pier Lifesaving Bureau for identification. It wasn't until the day before yesterday that an elderly woman from Suzhou, Zhang Zhou Shi, went to identify the deceased as her niece, Zhang Jinlin. She then reported to the District Court, requesting an autopsy. Simultaneously, the Water Police Station dispatched detectives to escort a witness (a dock worker) who claimed to have witnessed the deceased being thrown into the Huangpu River by criminals to the court for questioning. This matter has been reported in our newspaper twice. It is now learned that the court, after receiving the report, immediately appointed Prosecutor Xie Lian and Coroner Shen Qijie to the Southern Pier mortuary for an autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased, Zhang Jinlin, was female, had no trousers on her lower body, and had no visible injuries. Although bluish-purple marks were found on her chest and kidney areas, these were considered normal post-mortem changes and not unusual. Prosecutor Xie Lian, after personally confirming the facts, filled out the death certificate, authorizing the deceased's relative, Zhang Zhou Shi, to arrange for the coffin and burial.</p>
<p>After completing the autopsy, Prosecutor Xie returned to the court and summoned the witness, Hao Zhongyang, to appear in court. After a preliminary investigation, he immediately ordered Chief Judicial Police Officer Zhang Shuping and Chief Police Officer Chen Xihui to lead officers, along with Water Police Station detectives Huang Songsheng, Cheng Yongnian, and Shen Changshan, accompanied by the witness Hao Zhongyang, to calmly proceed to No. 18, Huaixian Lane, Lao Xianqian, in this city, and arrest a woman named Qiao Qi Shi. Then, they proceeded to Qiao Shun Chang Hat Shop on Fangbang Road and arrested Qiao Qi Shi's lover, Qiao Liantang. Finally, they went to</p>
<p>Sipailou and arrested Zhu Fuqing, the owner of Zhu Yuanxing Comb Shop, and three men and women. They were immediately taken to the court, where Prosecutor Xie interrogated them one by one and ordered them to be detained separately for further investigation. All the deceased's belongings were also dispatched by the Water Police Station detectives to the District Court for safekeeping pending collection. It was found that Zhu Fuqing, who was arrested in the case, had borrowed 2,000 yuan from the deceased three years ago, with a written loan agreement. He had recently repaid 260 yuan. The deceased only considered the 260 yuan as interest, while Zhu claimed it was a repayment of the principal and did not</p>
<p>acknowledge it as a loan. He only admitted that the deceased had deposited money in the Zhu Yuanxing Comb Shop. Recently, the deceased, feeling deceived by Zhu Fuqing, published a statement in the newspaper, roughly saying that this loan had been repaid, but the loan agreement had been lost and should be treated as waste paper if found in the future. The deceased then had someone read the draft of the newspaper announcement and realized that she had been deceived by Zhu Fuqing. Subsequently, through introductions, she hired a lawyer and was in the process of filing a lawsuit when the tragedy suddenly occurred, making it suspicious. It is believed that once the court conducts a thorough investigation, the truth will come to light, and the case will soon be fully clarified.</p>

<h3>Another "Fire Well" Discovered at the End of Liuying Road in Zhabei Yesterday; Fierce Flames Erupt from Underground Water Pipe; Xinfeng Silk Factory Installs a Pipe to Utilize It as a Furnace</h3>
<p>—This is the Sixth "Fire Well" Discovered in This City</p>
<p>Last year, a bizarre "fire well" was discovered in the Taizhou Guild Hall in this city. Recently, a "fire well" also erupted in the manager's residence of the British American Tobacco Company in Western Shanghai. Scientists believe that this phenomenon is worthy of research. According to a report by a Dagong She reporter, a "fire well" has also been discovered in the Xinfeng Silk Weaving Factory on Liuying Road in Zhabei. The reporter visited and inspected the site yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Discovery of the Fire Well The Liansheng Silk Factory at the end of Liuying Road in Zhabei ceased operations last year. Coincidentally, the Xinfeng Silk Weaving Factory in this city was expanding its business and needed to establish a printing and dyeing department. They purchased the land and rebuilt it into a printed fabric dyeing factory. Construction began in December last year, starting with demolition. Recently, workers accidentally discovered a water pipe buried underground, more than ten feet long, from which fierce flames were erupting. The flames were very strong and unapproachable. The factory staff could not extinguish them and covered them with mud and other materials to put out the fire. However, the flames occasionally still burst through, with smoke rising, extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Installation and Utilization The origin of this "fire well" is located next to the factory's finishing room, above which is the third workshop. The factory authorities, seeing the "fire well" continuously emitting flames, decided to utilize the waste. They converted the area into a paint testing laboratory, and the well was connected to a lead pipe that ran directly to the ground. The area around the pipe was paved with cement, leaving only the opening pointing upwards, turning it into a furnace for melting paints. It is also used for cooking, boiling water, and brewing tea. The heating power is equivalent to that of ordinary coal.</p>
<p>Cause of the Fire A Dagong She reporter drove to the site yesterday to observe. The "fire well" is located on the side of the Xinfeng Factory. Outside is a silted small river, with clear water flowing slowly and shadows of trees in the setting sun. However, nearby residents have been dumping trash and debris into the small river, making the river water turbid and emitting a foul odor. When asked, factory personnel said that there was also garbage under the "fire well." Because the land under the well is adjacent to this turbid small river, the amount of garbage is very large. According to geologists, the cause of the fire is the result of garbage decomposition. Because there is much garbage and debris under the well, it contains methane gas, which, after being exposed to the scorching sun, ignites.</p>
<p>Sixth Fire Well It is also learned that the discovery of "fire wells" in Shanghai has occurred six times. The first three times were during the years 1919 and 1920, but the locations and exact times are untraceable. The fourth time was last year in the Taizhou Guild Hall in Xieqiao, where a "fire well" was also discovered. The fire has not been extinguished to this day and is currently used as a fuel source by a soap factory leasing the property. The fifth time was at the end of last month when one was discovered at the residence of the British American Tobacco Company manager on Daxilu. At that time, the fire pipe exploded, and two workers were killed or injured. The sixth time is the "fire well" recorded in this article. Whether the geology of Shanghai contains fire has become a question. It is hoped that scientists and geologists will study this.</p>
<h3>Settlement of the Dachunghua Case: Fire Responsibility Not on the Factory Side; Public Safety Department Concludes Interrogation Yesterday</h3>
<p>The tragic fire at the Dachunghua Celluloid Factory on Xiaoshadu Road in Western Shanghai, after the families of the victims, Wu Shaowen and 40 others, filed a lawsuit against the factory's chairman, factory manager, deputy manager Zhu Rutang, Ge Tianmin, Jiang Junyan, Sun Hongcheng, Qian Menglin (also known as Qian Zhenhua), etc., has been heard twice by the First Special District Court. Mr. Du Yuesheng, a well-known figure in this city, and lawyer Jin Yu acted as mediators in an effort to reach a peaceful resolution. Both parties have now accepted the mediator's goodwill and agreed on a settlement, bringing the matter to a complete end. As for the case filed by Wu Shaowen and others, yesterday afternoon was another scheduled continuation of the trial. For the sake of solemnity, the police authorities still ordered Huisi Police Station Detective Shang Wu, Deputy Chief Hua, Head Detective Hua, detectives, and several Western detectives to go to the Criminal Court 8 of the First Special Court to assist the bailiffs and maintain order. At half past one, Judge Liu Yugui took the bench with the clerk and immediately declared that the plaintiffs had now submitted a statement requesting the withdrawal of the lawsuit. However, the part of the lawsuit concerning public safety is not legally permitted to be withdrawn and should be investigated and debated. The plaintiff's attorney, upon hearing this, rose and stated that the evidence in the case had not yet been investigated by the plaintiffs and was rather weak. Therefore, they had already requested permission to withdraw the lawsuit and requested that the defendants be acquitted. Judge Liu, because the defendants had not personally appeared, inquired about the cause of the fire and the factory's daily management from their defense attorneys. The defendants' defense attorneys were Xu Jie, Gu Yongquan, and Ling Qihong. Lawyer Xu replied that the fire was caused by the explosion of a stove pot when the neighbors next to the factory were cooking dinner. Not only were the defendants not present at the factory at the time, but all the workers had already left work. It is the factory's rule to stop working at 6 PM every day. Although the raw materials prepared by the factory are easily flammable, they are by no means explosive. The factory does not have electric lights installed and has dozens of fire extinguishers placed throughout the premises. Smoking is strictly prohibited for the workers. Therefore, there is absolutely no risk of fire. Moreover, the Factory Inspection Office and the Fire Brigade send personnel to the factory from time to time to investigate and provide guidance. There has never been any criticism of the management. Therefore, the responsibility for this incident does not lie with the factory, but is due to the carelessness of the neighbors. After the lawyers of both parties concluded their arguments, the court scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of August 13. Thereupon, the Chinese and Western detectives who were in court also withdrew.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Bank on Jinling Road: Summary of the Criminals' Confessions; He Jichang Initiated the Crime; All Criminals Admitted in Their Confessions</h3>
<p>After the robbery of the Bank of Communications car on Jinling Road in Zhabei on the morning of the 2nd of this month, Lu Ying, the chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective General Team, and Ji Yuanpu, the deputy chief, immediately ordered Bao Ziying, the chief of the Xinzha Detective Branch, and Shi Zuhan and Chu Jingwu, the deputy chiefs, to lead detectives to crack the gang of thieves within three days and arrest 23 male and female suspects and a ten-year-old girl. This has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that</p>
<p>the confessions of the thieves have been clarified as follows: (1) He Jichang (nicknamed "Little Shandong") confessed, "I committed a crime in the French Concession before and served a five-year sentence. Later, I was released in a general amnesty. A month ago, I met Bu Jinyuan, who said there was a deal, that the Bank of Communications car often passed through Jinling Road. So I invited Zhang Caihu and six others to gather in the Caojiadu workshop. There were two pistols and one Mauser pistol. The Bank of Communications guard's gun was seized by Xu Axiang. After the robbery, we went to the Zhaofeng</p>
<p>Garden to divide the loot. I got 70 yuan." (2) Lu Jinfu confessed, "A week ago, Little Shandong invited me to Jinling Road to rob. We set off from Little Shandong's house. Bu Jinyuan carried the Mauser pistol, my brother and Shi Arong each carried a pistol. We told Xu Axiang to push the bamboo cart ahead of us to wait on Jinling Road. The police's gun was seized when Shi Arong held the gun against the policeman, and Xu Axiang snatched the gun. Afterwards, I got 40 yuan." (3) Zhang Jichuan confessed, "A month ago, Little Shandong invited me and said they had pistols and a Mauser pistol, and we would rob. He took me to Jinling Road to take a look. I went with Li Dean, who</p>
<p>was in charge of watching the car driver (referring to the Bank of Communications car driver). Later, Li and I divided 7,500 yuan, and I used 40 yuan." (4) Lu Jintao confessed, "I was called by Zhang Caihu. There were seven of us who went that day. I got 30 yuan. There were more than 20 people who shared the loot. The police guard's gun was seized from He Jichang's house." (5) Zhang Yansheng confessed, "I didn't know they were going to rob, but He Jichang and I are friends. He came to my house to play, and he put the pistol and banknotes in my house. I didn't know they were stolen." (6) Xu Axiang confessed, "On the day of the robbery, Zhang Caihu called me at my house and said he had a small cart of bamboo and told me to push it to Jinling Road and stop. Later, a car came, and they told me to turn the cart</p>
<p>over across the road and rush up to rob. Later, Zhang Caihu gave me 30 yuan. I only used seven yuan, and the remaining 23 yuan has been confiscated. Lu Jintao took the guard's pistol, etc." (7) Shi Arong confessed, "On the day of the gun, I saw Little Shandong in a teahouse in Caojiadu. He told me to go rob with him. We gathered at his house</p>
<p>and set off. When we robbed on Jinling Road, I held a pistol against the policeman, and Lu Jinfu seized the policeman's gun. After the robbery, we took a car to Zhaofeng Garden, and Little Shandong gave me 30 yuan." (8) Li Dean confessed, "Zhang Caihu called me and Lin Gen to guard someone on Zhongshan Road (referring to Liu Defa, the driver of the Feili Automobile Company), and gave me a pistol. I said I didn't know how to use the pistol. Later, Zhang Caihu gave me 30 yuan." (9) Bu Jinyuan confessed,</p>
<p>"Wang Kaifu told Sun Laoer about the case, Sun Laoer told me, and I discussed it with Little Shandong. At first, Little Shandong said someone didn't have a gun, so I contacted Sun Laoer and spent over 100 yuan. Later, after the robbery, He Jichang gave me 50 yuan and gave me 690 yuan to give to Wang Kaifu 560 yuan. Sun Laoer used 60 yuan, and the remaining 70 yuan has been taken by others. Wang Kaifu's 560 yuan included 150 yuan for three guns and 300 yuan for tips" (referring to the person who first initiated the robbery of the Bank of Communications). (10) Wang Kaifu confessed, "A month ago, I told Zhou Xiaolao Han that the Bank of Communications car</p>
<p>was transporting banknotes and often traveled on Jinling Road. As a result, Bu Jinyuan and his gang went there. They said they robbed 700 or 800 yuan, which was not enough for carfare, etc." (11) Zhou Yiling (Zhou Xiaolao Han) confessed, "I sell yellow sand and gravel, run a teahouse, and don't do bad things." (12) Lu Caiji confessed, "I am already 60 years old. Lu Jintao and Lu Jinfu are my sons, Lu Chen Shi is my daughter-in-law, Lu Chunshou is my nephew, and Xu Atao is my son-in-law. I don't know they are doing bad things," etc. (13) Xu He Shi confessed,</p>
<p>"I met Xu Sanbao (referring to Xu Axiang) in a brothel, and he paid 1,000 yuan to redeem me," etc. (14) Hou Gu Shi confessed, "My husband has been dead for many years, and I have no one to rely on, so I am living with Zhang Yansheng." (15) Lu Zhao Shi confessed, "My husband is also dead, so I am living with Lu Xisheng (at large). I don't know what he does." The remaining Ding Lan Jin, Mao Shoubao, etc. all have confessions, all of which are evasive. The confessions of the above-mentioned thieves and male and female suspects are all very long. The above is a summary.</p>
<h3>Two Years After Yao Shenqing's Death, Son of Concubine Files Suit, Requesting Confirmation of Identity, Court Orders Both Parties to Mediate</h3>
<p>Yao Shenqing, former compradore of Anli &amp; Co., died in 1933, leaving behind a considerable estate. The estate was inherited by his wife, Sun Shi, and sons, Boxiong, Yanqing, Zimin, Yingjun, and Zhijie. Recently, Yao Fuzeng claimed to be the son of Shenqing's concubine, but the Yao family refused to recognize him. Therefore, he hired lawyers Huang Shaochang and Ling Qihong to file a lawsuit against Yao Sun Shi, Yao Boxiong, and Yao Yanqing in the First Special District Court to confirm his identity. The First Special Court has summoned them to court to encourage mediation. This was reported in this newspaper on the 12th of last month. Yesterday morning, Judge Peng Shi opened the Fourth Civil Court to continue the hearing. The defendants were not present, and lawyer Cai Liucheng represented them. Of the three witnesses summoned, Zhou Ahua, Yao Tiqing, and Zhang Chuchen, only Zhou Ahua appeared in court. According to his testimony, the plaintiff was born to Jin Shi, Yao Boxiong's nanny, and was adopted by Yao Shenqing. Later, the plaintiff married into the Tang family, and I introduced him to the Tang family on his behalf. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendants must be present in court because, in this type of personal lawsuit, there is much to be learned from the expressions and demeanor of the parties. He also requested that blood tests be conducted by a forensic doctor, which would make it easy to determine the truth. The defendants' lawyer also presented a copy of Yao Shenqing's obituary and a copy of Shenqing's mother's obituary, neither of which listed the plaintiff, to prove that the plaintiff was not Shenqing's biological son. Judge Peng believed that the witnesses in the case had not all arrived and that it was necessary for the defendants to appear in court in person. Therefore, he ordered the hearing to be postponed and again urged the parties to attempt mediation outside of court.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Changping Road: Peddler Shot While Chasing Robbers; Victim Runs Out to Call for Help; Robbers Snatch Three Quilts</h3>
<p>At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, nine bandits suddenly went to rob the Liang family at No. 27, Lane 88, Changping Road in Western Shanghai. Two of the bandits were armed with pistols. They tricked their way into opening the front door and went straight into the store, loudly asking if Mr. Liang was at home. At that time, the owner of the house had not yet gone to bed. Upon hearing the commotion downstairs, he knew something was wrong. He groped his way downstairs, went out through the back door, circled to the front door, and peeked in to see what was happening. When he saw the bandits, he immediately turned around and ran out of the lane, shouting for help. As a result, the bandits inside the house did not have time to search thoroughly and simply grabbed three quilts and fled. At that time, a peddler from Jiangbei named Yu Chengbin, 57 years old, happened to be at the entrance of the lane. When he saw the bandits running out, he immediately rushed to chase them out of a sense of righteousness. Unexpectedly, the bandits noticed and fired two shots at Wang, hitting both of his legs. He immediately fell to the ground. The Gordon Road Police Station was notified and sent detectives to the scene, but the bandits had already fled. They quickly took Wang Chengbin to the hospital for treatment, but because of his advanced age, his condition was very critical. At the same time, detectives were dispatched to search for the gang of bandits.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Consolidated Tax Inspection Office Seizes Large Quantity of Smuggled Artificial Silk, Totaling 440 Bundles</h3>
<p>According to Dagong She, the North District Branch of the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Su-Zhe-Wan Consolidated Tax Bureau recently received a tip that a large quantity of smuggled artificial silk would be landed from Zhelun, Jinshanwei, Haining, Zha Pu, etc., and smuggled into Shanghai. Cai Guanglu, the director of the branch, immediately dispatched inspectors to strictly guard all strategic locations within his jurisdiction. After a month, at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, 15 sacks of smuggled "Tianqiao" brand artificial silk, totaling 440 small bundles, equivalent to 22 cases, were discovered in front of the railway gate on Maisan Road in Zhabei. Each sack was marked with the words "Sent from Nanxing Station, Hangzhou." The branch director immediately reported to the general office. Jin Gong, the director of the general office, reviewed the report and believed that the case involved a large amount of artificial silk that evaded national taxes. He immediately transferred the case to the Customs for handling in accordance with regulations and to investigate the owner of the goods and punish them severely in accordance with the law in order to deter tax evasion and safeguard national taxes.</p>
<h3>Minfeng Paper Company Obtains Exclusive Manufacturing Rights for Cigarette Paper</h3>
<p>Minfeng Paper Company, founded by Chu Huiseng, Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingsun, Zhu Meixian, Jin Runxiang, etc., has been in operation for many years and is located in Jiaxing. It has been imitating various foreign paper products, offering high-quality goods at reasonable prices, and has been widely praised by society. Last year, the company's management, in view of the large amount of imported cigarette paper, proposed to add investment to purchase machinery for imitation production. After submitting the proposal to the shareholders' meeting, it was resolved and approved. Furthermore, because no domestic manufacturer was producing this cigarette paper, it applied to the government for exclusive manufacturing rights in accordance with the Industrial Encouragement Law. It has recently been learned that the Ministry of Industry has approved the application. The notice from the Ministry of Industry received by the company yesterday stated that the company's application to use the latest foreign methods to imitate cigarette paper and to grant exclusive manufacturing rights had been reviewed by the Industrial Encouragement Review Committee. The ministry re-examined the results and found that it complied with the provisions of Article 1, Section 2 of the Industrial Encouragement Law. It was approved to enjoy exclusive manufacturing rights for five years, from September 1, 1935, to August 31, 1940, in the four provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Hebei, and in the three municipalities of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao. Please pay the stamp tax of 1 yuan and 50 cents to issue the license. This is a notice. It is also reported that the machines ordered by the company have been continuously arriving at the factory and are being installed as quickly as possible. It is expected that the products will be available in March or April next spring, which is also a dawn for the domestic goods industry.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Company; The National Products Association Will Provide Legal Protection for Unpaid Consignment Payments Owed to Various Domestic Goods Factories</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association has repeatedly received visits from factory members, including Xu Yunhui, a representative of the Senyuanxiang Jewelry Factory, and letters from more than 20 companies, including the Dachunghua Celluloid Factory, requesting protection for the priority interest in outstanding consignment payments and inventory for products consigned to the Shanghai National Products Company, to avoid innocent losses, and requesting leadership in negotiations. After deliberation by the Standing Committee, it was resolved to strive for protection in accordance with the provisions of Article 6, Section 5 of Chapter 2 of the Association's charter. However, it was unclear whether consignment payments were treated differently from ordinary outstanding payments, so a letter was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for interpretation and legal negotiation, and the matter was recorded. It is now learned that the Association's Secretariat yesterday issued a notice to all factory members, soliciting information on outstanding consignment payments and inventory owed by the company in order to compile a summary of the case, nominate responsible representatives, and entrust legal advisors Xue Dubi, Pan Zhensheng, Mao Yun, Ma Junshuo, Bao Zhenhuang, and other senior lawyers to handle the case. The original letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is excerpted below: "To the esteemed Chamber: This is to report that the Shanghai National Products Company, as the earliest established store dedicated to promoting domestic goods, advocated cooperation between production and sales and consolidated production and construction. It held unlimited hopes for a prosperous future. Unfortunately, due to the collapse of the rural economy and the decline in social consumption, it suffered from financial difficulties and was unable to maintain operations. Faced with the environment, it suddenly suspended operations, ultimately unable to reorganize and declared liquidation, which has severely affected the promotion of domestic goods and is of particular concern to the rights of various factories. The association has received visits from members of more than ten factories, including the Senyuanxiang Jewelry Factory, and letters from more than twenty factories, including the Dachunghua Celluloid Factory, requesting protection for the priority interest in outstanding consignment payments and promissory notes for consigned products. In this regard, the association has found that it has no basis to determine whether consignment payments, payments for purchased goods, matured promissory notes, and unmatured promissory notes (using the company's suspension of operations as the standard date) are treated differently in the event of the company's declaration of liquidation. Therefore, this letter is sent to you with the hope that you will provide a legal interpretation so that we may proceed accordingly. We thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Zhou Jianyun and his wife, the manager of the Mingxing Film Company, and actress Hu Die, were invited to participate in the Soviet International Film Exhibition this spring. They traveled a long way to Russia to attend and were also commissioned by the government to take the opportunity to investigate the European film industry and participate in the German International Film Conference, in order to improve domestic film production.

<h3>Large Quantity of Red Pills Seized at North Station, Four People Involved Arrested, All Employees of Huitong Company, Yesterday Taken to Public Security Bureau for Interrogation</h3>
<p>At around 10 AM on the 3rd of this month, military police stationed at the North Railway Station were inspecting passengers entering and leaving the station to check for smuggled contraband. They noticed several people carrying two large wooden boxes, intending to transport them to Xin'an County, Luoyang, Henan. The military police, as per regulations, ordered them to stop and open the boxes for inspection. Unexpectedly, the large wooden boxes had false bottoms. The top was filled with towels, galoshes, and other items, with a tin box hidden in the middle, and dozens of pounds of red pills, estimated at over 600,000 pills, were concealed in the box and the false bottoms. The people transporting the items, realizing the gravity of the situation, immediately fled, failing to be apprehended. Only the red pills, along with the two large wooden boxes, were taken to the railway police station for detailed investigation. It was then learned that the wooden boxes were being shipped by the Huitong Transportation Company at 175 Jielu Road, and that the Huitong Company's warehouse office was located at 799 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. The military police immediately dispatched personnel to investigate. However, the warehouse office was tightly locked, with no one inside. Subsequently, Fang Jianquan, the accountant of Huitong Transportation Company, was summoned to the police station for questioning. According to Fang, although the boxes were shipped by their company, the company was unaware of the contents and that there were contraband items in the boxes. To his knowledge, the boxes were directly entrusted to the company office for shipment by Wang Shanqing, who lived at No. 26 Fudeli, North Sichuan Road. Therefore, the office should be responsible for the matter. The police station then ordered Fang to investigate. At 4:25 PM the day before yesterday, Fang found Wang Chengyu, an accountant from Suzhou in the company's accounting department, along with Pan Lansheng from Qingpu, the director of the Huitong warehouse office, and clerks Ye Buyuan and Yao Zuozhou (both from Suzhou) hiding at No. 9 Ningkangli, 381 North Zhejiang Road. He reported this to the Railway Police Department, which notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send detectives, together with Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Bao Detective Zhuge Qian from the Huisi Police Station, and Western Detective Locke, to the address. They apprehended Wang Chengyu and the other three and took them to the Huisi Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Detective Wang Zhengrong from the Public Security Bureau brought a document requesting their transfer. Qian Jiujiu, the lawyer for the police station, explained the case in detail and did not oppose the transfer. Subsequently, Fang Jianquan, the accountant of Huitong Transportation Company, stated that the boxes were received by Pan Lansheng, the director of their company's office. Pan had been whispering with Wang Chengyu in the company for a long time on the 2nd of this month, and the four of them were arrested together yesterday, suggesting a conspiracy. The company was unaware of the matter. Among those arrested, Wang was an accountant, while the other three were employees of the office. When questioned, Pan Lansheng confessed that the boxes were sent by someone in a rickshaw on August 2nd, claiming they contained towels and galoshes to be shipped to Xin'an County, Luoyang. Yao Zuozhou weighed the boxes at the time, and Yao and Ye Buyuan transported them to the North Railway Station, unaware that they contained red pills. The other three gave evasive answers. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confessions and approved the transfer of Wang Chengyu and the other three to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>District Court Rectifies Conduct</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Court issued a proclamation yesterday, the text of which is transcribed below: "The court's handling of affairs places the utmost importance on conduct. Shanghai is a mixed community of Chinese and foreigners, with both good and bad elements. It is inevitable that unscrupulous individuals will fabricate lawsuits and seek to profit by exploiting them. Some may even falsely claim to be acquainted with court personnel, falsely enter and leave the court, in order to achieve their fraudulent wishes. The ignorant are deceived by them and believe them to be true. After regretting it, they file anonymous complaints, making reckless attacks, often concealing the facts, making it impossible to investigate. Since assuming office, the president of this court has been supervising at all times, without any leniency. Therefore, this proclamation is issued earnestly. It must be known that this court accepts civil and criminal lawsuits and handles them in accordance with the law, based on evidence. If there are unscrupulous individuals who swindle and deceive others, or impersonate court staff to defraud and obtain money, the victims should immediately seize them on the spot, or identify them by name and report the facts. If court staff are found to have engaged in illegal activities, they may also be accused. Once the facts are verified, they will be severely punished. However, anonymous letters and arbitrary accusations will not be accepted. All must comply. This is hereby proclaimed."</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Ji Yu)</p>
<p>Between the poor and the rich, there is only a thin membrane of happiness. This membrane is very thin, and it can be easily torn and flow to the neighbor. Therefore, the rich should protect their membrane, and the poor should destroy their membrane.</p>
<p>Anyone's money should be spent in the right place. The so-called right place can determine a person's meanness and wastefulness. In other words, spending a penny in the wrong place is wasteful, and not willing to spend all the property in the most appropriate place is stingy. Conversely, when money should not be spent, we must save a penny, and when money should be spent, we can squander all our wealth.</p>
<p>Poor and miserable people are often prone to success in their careers, just like iron forged in a raging fire, the more solid it becomes.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who want to succeed should not dislike poverty and hardship, hoping that they can endure this poverty and hardship.</p>
<h3>Strange Omens and Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Lin Yi Tan</p>
<p>Whenever someone has an unexpected misfortune, recalling the events before the misfortune, they feel that there were omens预先 warning them, but no one can guess or understand them beforehand. Only afterward do they suddenly realize. This can be regarded as an inexplicable problem worthy of study. The following story has this kind of characteristic.</p>
<p>A clansman of mine, rich in wealth, is a giant in the Fuzhou financial world. Once, in a famous poetry club in Fuzhou, he was reciting the third verse of a "branch-plucking poem" for the sounds "xiang" (相, appearance) and "xiang" (鄉, village). (Branch-plucking poems are very common in Fuzhou, because there are more people who love poetry.) This clansman of mine wrote a verse: "Thieves who look familiar should not be missed, prostitutes who seem like villagers are worth recognizing." This unspeakable verse is naturally "Yu Yuan" (榆元, a type of poetry mistake). But the strangeness lies in the verse, which is the peculiarity of the omen.</p>
<p>Two days later, he and his family took a car to the suburbs for a drive. When the car drove far from the city, it was dusk, and all around were wheat fields. Suddenly, four or five kidnappers rushed out, first firing shots into the sky, and then intercepting the car, kidnapping only him. In the bandit's lair, he learned that one of the kidnappers was his former employee whom he had dismissed. Because the employee knew he was rich, he specifically investigated his travels and carried out the kidnapping.</p>
<p>There was also a strange thing: when he arrived at the bandit's lair, there was already a woman there. This woman was none other than his lover, a quite famous girl in Fuzhou. Because she was quite famous, she was also kidnapped by the bandits. They suffered together in the bandit's lair, and their feelings naturally deepened a lot.</p>
<p>Later, he was redeemed, spending more than 20,000 yuan. After he came out, he told the strange story of the omen, which was widely circulated and caused a sensation in Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Ying Gu</h3>
<p>— Chen Qiu Nong</p>
<p>In a very large wasteland at the intersection of Xing Road and Yongxing Road, there are many performers who perform various arts every day. There are Peking opera, circus, as well as various Tanhuang and one-man shows, comedies, two-man shows, storytelling, Yangzhou opera, Shaoxing opera, national martial arts troupes, magic, and so on. It is also like an open-air big world. Every day, there are many spectators, like a mountain of people. Generally, small businesses compete to set up stalls and do business here.</p>
<p>Ying Gu is a woman who performs martial arts and sings ditties. She also sings and performs skills here every day. There are more than ten male and female performers in her troupe. Because Ying Gu is the most beautiful, she is considered the pillar of the troupe. More than a dozen people rely on her beautiful voice and appearance to make a living.</p>
<p>This afternoon, various performances began at the same time. Ying Gu's venue also struck the opening gong and drum at the same time. Before long, the spectators had surrounded each venue. Every day, except for the circus venue, Ying Gu's venue is always the most popular.</p>
<p>At this time, Ying Gu had already started performing. Another female performer lay prone on a square table, with her feet pointing upwards. Ying Gu went up and sat cross-legged on the soles of those upward-facing feet, said a few opening remarks, and then began to sing the "Touching..." ditty, with the title "Touching Everything," from a set of erotic folk songs. The surrounding spectators stared at her blankly.</p>
<p>The "Touching Everything" song was almost finished. Several performers next to her were preparing to ask the surrounding spectators for money to provide dinner for more than a dozen companions. Suddenly, a policeman walked out of the crowd, stepped forward and called her down, and said, "This ditty is related to public morals. Take you to the bureau to pay a fine."</p>
<p>Although Ying Gu is a woman who knows martial arts, with at least seven or eight police officers' resistance, but in the end, she did not dare to offend him. As a result, she closed the venue and stopped singing.</p>
<p>That night, the stomachs of more than a dozen people were affected by this police officer. Some were making echoes, and some were launching sirens, making a commotion all night long.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: Do Not Ask About a Daughter's Difficulties or Hidden Pain, Compete to See a Noble Person's Face and Admire Lofty Conduct Together</p>
<p>Yueying frowned and said, "When Master Jia goes out, he even wants to lock the door. I said that if you lock me in the room, it's like you're afraid I'll run away, and if others see it, I'll be embarrassed. He thought for a while before letting me close the door and sit in the room. If a friend comes, just say he's gone and don't open the door. You've come, and you're a woman, so I dare to let you in. Please sit down, is there anything I can do for you?" As she spoke, she knew to pour a cup of tea and put it on the table for the guest. Seeing her sitting on the bed, Huanhua also sat next to her, took one of her hands into her arms, and gently stroked it, saying, "Sister, tell me the truth, are you really happy with this marriage?" Yueying suddenly looked at her, as if she didn't expect him to say this, and said, "Isn't that obvious? I'm not hungry anymore, and I have clothes to wear." Huanhua still held her hand, and paid more attention to her face. She felt that her face was tight, and she wasn't smiling, so she put her hand on her shoulder and said, "I'm lying, am I? I don't think you're very happy." Yueying lowered her head, looking at her own hands, but did not answer. Huanhua said, "See! What did I say? You're sad again, aren't you?" Yueying looked up at him again, and then whispered, "I don't have anything else to be sad about, it's just that I can't see my mother, and I can't see my grandmother." Huanhua said, "Master Jia won't let you go back, can't your family come to see you?" (283)</p>
<h3>Records of the Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>"Fathers often have to say to their children with tears in their eyes: 'I have no choice but to hit you now, but I myself am more painful than if I were hit ten times; if I hit you ten times, it's like hitting myself a hundred times. Your pain is on your body, but my pain is in my heart!'" Now that I have punished this minister, who has stood in court for a long time, in this way, the pain I feel in my own heart is really no less than what he feels!"</p>
<p>"However, things are already like this, we must quickly find other things to do, so that we can drive away these troubles; otherwise, how can we forget this matter? But we really have to forget it, because we have too many courtiers, and how can no one commit crimes again in the future? If someone commits a crime, of course, they will inevitably be punished, and if we accumulate troubles one after another, wouldn't we accumulate too much? We people with bad health, how can we stand it? If we are angered to death, it might not be enough! But what's the use?"</p>
<p>From the Empress Dowager's two conversations above, it can be seen that she still has some ability to distinguish right from wrong; she also recognizes that the things done by the Governor of Guangdong were wrong, which shows that she is not completely unable to distinguish between black and white. According to my usual careful observation, she not only sees clearly what other people have done wrong, but she can also be aware of any mistakes she herself has made, and she never deliberately covers them up, and can always admit them very frankly; of course, she will never be punished for doing anything wrong, or go to apologize to others.

<h3>Another Explanation of You and You</h3>
<p>— Hong Yang</p>
<p>This "Spring and Autumn" is caused by the odd surname draft, the debate of "You" (尤) with a dot and "You" (尢) without a dot. Now the descendants of Duke You Wenjian of Wuxi are compiling their genealogy and are uniting with the You surname of Suzhou. In Duke You Wenjian's handwritten notes, it can be known that at that time, the You surname did have a dot, but the two large clans of the You surname in Suzhou, Liu Jiabang and Fenghuang Street, did not have a dot. Therefore, it can be distinguished that Wuxi is the You surname (尤), and Suzhou is the You surname (尢). Thus, there is the following research.</p>
<p>According to archaeologists, the You lineage of Suzhou is a descendant of Fang Xiaoru of the Ming Dynasty. When Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty executed Fang Xiaoru's ten clans, Fang Xiaoru had a young son who escaped the net of heaven and did not perish. He fled to Suzhou and changed his surname to Tian (田). The shape of the character Tian is square on all four sides. Changing the surname to Tian was actually using the shape of the character as the surname, without abandoning the memory of the Fang surname. Later, the surname was changed from Tian to You (尢). Therefore, the You surname lineage of Suzhou is a descendant of Fang Xiaoru. The surname was changed from Fang to Tian, and then from Tian to the You (尢) surname.</p>
<p>This kind of legend is somewhat illusory, but investigating the Suzhou You surname clan, there is a saying that they were surnamed Tian seven or eight generations ago, and then they were surnamed You without a dot. With this saying, it can be somewhat certain that the Suzhou You is a descendant of Fang Xiaoru who changed his surname. Perhaps the reason for removing the dot from the You surname was to distinguish it from the real You surname, which can also convince people. However, the reason for changing from Tian to You later cannot be verified.</p>
<p>Now the descendants of Duke You Wenjian of Wuxi are compiling their genealogy. Although the You surname of Suzhou is missing a dot, and there is a legend that the descendants of Fang Xiaoru changed from Tian to You, but since the surname has been changed to You, it is naturally closely related to the You surname. Otherwise, why not be surnamed Zhao, Qian, Sun, or Li, but must be surnamed You and remove a dot? Of course, it has a great relationship with the You surname. Uniting as one clan is certainly not impossible!</p>
<p>Whereabouts</p>
<h3>Summer Night in Chao Mountain</h3>
<p>— Wang Fang An</p>
<p>It is best to escape the summer heat in the mountains. Looking at the peaks of Kuanglu, Mogan, and Huangshan, where skirts and shoes gather in recent times, this saying is indeed correct. Two or three years ago, I stayed in Hangzhou. I always went to the lake to cool off in the hot summer, especially at night. Every time, I would not return home until late at night when the moon set and the stars thinned. Often in the light of the lamps and the moon, gazing at the center of the lake, and looking at the mountains on the lake from a distance, I would always feel leisurely and yearn for it. I regretted being burdened by official duties and not pursuing it deep into the mountains! Since retiring to my hometown, the humble door has been closed for a long time. Daily chores of rice and firewood have long ceased to be a source of pleasure. Recently, I have been suffering from the heat, and living at home in a cramped space makes me feel suffocated, so I have begun to think far away. Several times I planned to travel freely, but ultimately failed to fulfill my wish. Thinking about my hometown, how could there be no beautiful mountains and rivers? Therefore, on a certain day of the month, I went alone to Chao Mountain to visit the monk Miyin and stayed at Bao Ci Temple.</p>
<p>At that time, Chao Mountain was known for watching plum blossoms, and its reputation even surpassed Deng Wei and Lonely Island. However, there are many lush pines and green bamboos in the mountains, which are also suitable for cooling off in the summer. Compared to the scenery, plum blossom viewers may not be able to appreciate one or two of them. After the plum blossoms bloom in the mountains, tourists gradually become sparse. By the time of midsummer, there are few traces of people, which is especially suitable for quietness. Coming here from the hustle and bustle, I truly feel like I am in another world! I came alone, and only the monk Miyin was left alone at Bao Ci Temple. The temple servants were busy with farming and had all gone up the mountain to transplant rice seedlings. The mountains were silent, as if I were outside of the bustling world.</p>
<p>I entered the mountain in the early morning. The monk Miyin and I had a very good relationship, and we often traveled and lived together without restraint. We sat on futons in his meditation room and had pleasant conversations. The bitterness in our hearts was especially interesting. After eating, we had wild vegetables and bamboo shoots, purple eggplants and green beans, as well as the temple's carefully made vegetarian ham and smoked tofu skin, accompanied by homemade rose wine. Although I am not good at drinking, I finished two cups. Although I never eat heartily, I ate three bowls. The flavor of rural life was fully experienced in the temple's kitchen. At noon, cicadas chirped in the treetops, listening to the high-pitched songs that soared into the clouds, slightly breaking the silence. I did not dislike their annoyance, but if I were not in the mountains, I could not have this state of mind.</p>
<p>That evening, the pine wind rustled, like roaring waves, the heat dissipated, and coolness arose on the pillow. It was quite like being in a jade pavilion in the sky, where the cold was unbearable at the heights! I occasionally peeked out the window at the moon in the sky, which was like mercury pouring on the ground. I gazed at the Lion Peak in the distance, which was high and connected to the sky, and the Saddle Mountain on the back, which was like a beauty shrouded in smoke. The beauty of a summer night in Chao Mountain is truly difficult to describe with a colorful brush!</p>
<p>After entering the mountain, I stayed for three days and nights. During the day, I slept soundly by the south window, quietly inhaling the refreshing breeze, dreaming of a sweet dreamland, and listening to the sound of the flowing spring gurgling to my pillow, cleansing my worries. Every night, I would either invite one or two farmers to chat about farming under the bean trellis or melon rack, or I would accompany the monk to the Hangzhou Tangqi car road, cross the Bai Su Mountain Bridge, look down at the clear stream, scoop up the moon in the water, or even row a small boat, leisurely in the middle of the water, letting the gentle waves send me swaying. Moreover, there are many temples in the mountains. Because of my relationship with the monk, I was also well received everywhere. Therefore, I either climbed to Maming Temple to overlook the night market in Tangqi, or entered Huacheng Nunnery to rub the ancient traces of Zhao Songxue's well curb inscription, or sat in the ancient Guanyin Nunnery to listen to the pine waves, or went to Si Shui Nunnery to draw natural spring water to brew bitter tea. And there are many futons and scripture scrolls in Bao Ci Temple for me to pass the time. This scene, this situation, I wonder if those who are addicted to mountains and rivers, in this humid and hot season, also yearn for it?</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, I also took my younger brother to escape the summer heat and live in the mountains. At that time, I stayed at Da Yuan Temple at the foot of Saddle Mountain. The monk Miyin was the abbot of the temple, so we were very happy. The temple was less than a mile away from Chao Mountain, while Bao Ci Temple was still in the wilderness, like Yi Guang going to Luo Luo when she was still poor. Thinking about it now, seventeen years have passed since I first went there. Changes in personnel are immeasurable, not to mention the feeling of the sea changing into mulberry fields?</p>

Alloy electric furnaces should be added as soon as possible. 2. In terms of teaching, a proper implementation plan for the practical work of mining and metallurgy students should be established, and the time for physical science demonstrations and experiments should be increased. 3. The college's mechanical manufacturing research is highly relevant to China's current needs, and the experimental expenses should be appropriately increased to facilitate this research work."</p>
<p>Hebei Provincial Women's Normal College: An order to Hebei Provincial Women's Normal College states, in essence, "This college has previously been instructed by the Ministry to make improvements based on key points. Upon reviewing the report from the recent inspectors, it is found that the college has generally paid attention to implementation over the past year. However, there has been no significant progress in the two areas of increasing the number of full-time teachers and raising the level of students. Therefore, continued efforts should be made to improve in accordance with the previous order. In addition, the equipment for food chemistry in the home economics specialization should also be added, and a practical program should be properly established to facilitate implementation. As for the college's request to change the physical education specialization back to a department, it is found that the college's preparations for physical education teachers have slightly improved in recent years. It is advisable to first focus on running the specialization seriously and pay attention to the universal training of all students in physical education. Expansion can be considered after achieving success. It is hereby ordered to comply and report."</p>

Upon reviewing the report from the recent inspectors, it is found that the college has earnestly implemented the points raised in the Ministry's order, and there has been much progress in other areas as well. Despite financial difficulties, the college has been able to strive for the enrichment of equipment, and the school's simple and progressive academic atmosphere has become increasingly evident, which is commendable and gratifying. However, the teaching hours of full-time professors should still be reduced to allow them to devote more effort to manufacturing research work. The educational aspect is quite thorough, but attention should be paid to cultivating students' spirit of self-government and autonomy. It is hereby ordered to comply and adhere to it."</p>
<p>Tianjin Industrial and Commercial College: An order to Tianjin Industrial and Commercial College (private) states, in essence, "This college has followed the Ministry's key points for improvement and implemented them accordingly.

<p>Education Bureau Bans Rixin School</p>
<p>Rixin School in Rixin Lane, Dengwan Road, Public Concession, has corrupt content and is run illegally. It has neither applied for registration with the Education Bureau in accordance with the regulations for private schools for a long time, nor has it requested registration in accordance with the rules for private schools. The school principal, Qian Chongshan, is a person from a medicinal herb village who does not understand the essence of education and is not dedicated to running the school. The teacher, Qian Zhenchun, has no qualifications at all and is mentally dull. The City Education Bureau sent personnel to clearly identify it as misleading the children of the citizens and should be banned. It is reported that a letter has been sent to the Public Works Department to instruct the relevant patrolmen to strictly enforce it.</p>
<p>Private School Teacher Training Class: City Education Bureau to Begin Registration on the 10th of This Month</p>
<p>The City Education Bureau will co-organize a private school teacher training seminar by district and has set the 10th of this month as the start date for registration. A special notice was issued yesterday, which stated: "We have received Order No. 4836 from the General Private Education Department of the Ministry of Education. After reviewing the organization and curriculum of private schools, it is found that many of them do not comply with the provisions of educational laws and regulations. Most of their teachers also do not meet the qualifications for elementary school teachers, and they are often unaware of teaching and training methods. Therefore, they should be strictly banned. However, at a time when education is not yet widespread and timely, it does not hinder the enrollment scope of local elementary schools and can be allowed to exist. At the same time, the educational administrative authorities should take various measures to improve them, so as to assist in the promotion of compulsory education. In order to improve private schools and promote compulsory education, the bureau is hereby ordered to instruct the educational administrative authorities of the counties and cities under its jurisdiction to recruit local private school teachers during the summer vacation from this year onwards to hold private school training classes. The subjects should be taught with basic knowledge and teaching methods in Mandarin, arithmetic, and general knowledge, etc., according to the actual needs of the private school teachers. The lecture should focus on practical issues and practice, rather than merely lecturing on theory. After the lecture, an examination should be added as a basis for rewards. As for the specific measures for the private school teacher training class, the bureau should quickly draft them in detail according to local conditions and submit them to the Ministry for record. In view of this, it is found that this city has a vast area and a large number of private schools. After the bureau sent personnel to investigate private school teachers, most of them lacked qualifications, had shallow knowledge, and had rigid teaching methods. Therefore, they should be trained to assist in the promotion of compulsory education. In response to the previous order, the private school teacher training class measures have been drafted and submitted to the 201st Bureau Affairs Meeting of this bureau for discussion and amended for approval, and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. The private school teacher training book measures are now announced for public knowledge, and all private school teachers should submit reports to the schools in the district where they are located from the 10th to the 20th of this month, according to the form, and should not extend the deadline. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Education Bureau instructed municipal primary and secondary schools: "It is found that the service performance and teaching efficiency of teachers in each school are proportional to the length of their term of office. It is not appropriate to easily change or transfer them. Now, at the beginning of the school term, teachers in municipal primary and secondary schools in this city whose contracts have not yet expired, unless they have committed a definite fault or have extremely poor grades, and have been approved by this bureau in advance for transfer, may not terminate their contracts midway. Furthermore, municipal normal school students and those who have participated in summer school with excellent grades should also be maintained in their positions to provide them with security. It is hereby urgently ordered that the new and old principals of each municipal primary and secondary school in this city must earnestly comply with and implement it without delay. This order is hereby issued."</p>

<p>Statistics of This Year's Students Studying Abroad: 109 People Have Completed the Procedures</p>
<p>A large number of students studying abroad who will be going overseas in August and September have completed the departure procedures with the Shanghai Global Student Association. The statistics are as follows: 72 students studying in the United States, 12 students studying in France, 9 students studying in the United Kingdom, 8 students studying in Germany, 1 student studying in the Netherlands, 1 student studying in Austria, 1 student studying in Denmark, and 1 student studying in Belgium, for a total of 109 people.</p>
<p>Lixin Accounting School: A Branch School of the Evening School Department is Added in the Nanshi District, Located at No. 25, Xuexi Street, Wenmiao, Ximen</p>
<p>The Lixin Accounting School at No. 190, Ningbo Road, in this city is affiliated with the Lixin Certified Public Accountants Office, which is headed by Dr. Pan Xushu. It has two departments: correspondence and evening school. The correspondence department enrolls students year-round, and students can enroll at any time. The evening school department enrolls students twice a year, in the spring and autumn semesters. This year's spring class has already ended, and the autumn class is scheduled to start on August 29th. The classes are divided into elementary and advanced levels. The elementary level includes five subjects: elementary bookkeeping, advanced bookkeeping, Chinese group, English group, and commercial arithmetic. It is specially prepared for beginners to study. The advanced level is divided into seven subjects: advanced accounting, bank accounting, company food accounting, government accounting, accounting mathematics, cost accounting, and auditing, for those who already have a considerable level to study further. In recent years, the social need for accounting talents has become increasingly widespread, resulting in a surge in the number of students applying to the school each semester. Due to the school's location, the number of students per semester could not exceed 340 or 350, so dozens of people who registered late were often unable to join. In the previous semester, in response to the demands of all parties, several classrooms were added to the Xinhua Bank on Jiangxi Road. This semester, in order to facilitate students residing in the Nanshi area, a branch school has been added at No. 15, Xuexi Street, Wenmiao Road, Ximen, Nanshi, to avoid the trouble of students traveling long distances in the evening. The registration office is still at No. 190, Ningbo Road. It is reported that since the enrollment began, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Datong University Increases Scholarship Amounts</p>
<p>In order to encourage students to graduate, Datong University has established scholarships for 10 students, each receiving 20 yuan per semester, to be awarded to the students with the best grades. Last year, Mr. Ouyuan Huai's father, Mr. Bo, donated 6,000 yuan to the school on his 70th birthday to be used as a scholarship fund. The interest of 200 yuan is withdrawn each semester to award four students with the best grades, each receiving 50 yuan. This semester, the school initiated the raising of poor scholarships to show consideration for the poor students. People from all walks of life expressed their sympathy and generously donated money. More than 1,000 yuan has now been received, which will be used exclusively to subsidize poor students.</p>
<p>Wu Ruinian Succeeds as Principal of Dazhong Middle School</p>
<p>Dazhong Middle School, registered with the City Education Bureau on Kunshan Road, North Sichuan Road, has been established for many years and enjoys a long-standing reputation. Mr. Zhang Zhirang, the principal of the school, has recently been busy with public affairs and has no time to take care of it. He has repeatedly resigned from his position to the board of directors, and his determination to leave is very strong. The board of directors was unable to retain him, so they hired Wu Ruinian to succeed him. It is reported that the handover procedures were completed on the 5th of this month. Mr. Wu has a master's degree from Columbia University in the United States and has gained considerable knowledge in chemistry. He is the author of the high school textbook "Basic Chemistry" and the youth career books "Chemistry Learning Method" and "Salt Research". He has served as a professor at the Zhejiang Public Industrial College and is currently a full-time chemistry teacher at the Shanghai Provincial Middle School. He is also a registered technician of the Ministry of Industry and a member of the Chinese Chemical Research Association. Mr. Wu is not only keen on education, but also spares no effort in guiding young people. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has repeatedly issued orders to commend him. Now that he has come to head the school, he will definitely add a unique color to the education world, and the development of the school is even more promising.</p>
<p>News from Various Schools</p>
<p>Fahuashi Primary School: The Municipal Huxi Fahuashi Primary School of this city. Last year, the principal of the school, Tang Naixin, said that the school was the old site of the Township Office Grain Depot for more than 100 years, and it was in danger of collapsing. Therefore, he applied to the Municipal Government for an appropriation of funds. Yang Bingxing also donated thousands of yuan and commissioned Qiao Yuxing Construction Factory to build a new school site on the original site. After half a year of preparation, construction began in January this year. Designed by Zhang Ruifang, a technician from the Education Bureau, construction was completed in May. The internal settings are extremely perfect. In addition to classrooms and dormitories, there are also auditoriums, libraries, equipment rooms, basketball courts, and various sports equipment. It is considered a complete school among the primary schools in the rural area. The school is now scheduled to open on August 22nd.</p>
<p>Mu's Literary Society: In view of the low level of Chinese language proficiency among young people in the vocational field and the lack of opportunities for those who aspire to study Chinese language, the industrialist Mu Ouchu invested in the establishment of the Mu's Literary Society, specializing in the revision of youth essays and the guidance of reading books. In addition to hiring Lu Boyu, the former editor of the World Book Company, to take charge of the matter, he specially appointed famous scholars in the Chinese studies circle and educational leaders Shen Xinlian, Jia Jiying, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, Yan Esheng, Yang Weiyu, and Pan Yangyao as tutors to provide practical guidance on the path of learning literature. Those who join the society only need to pay a society fee of four yuan to enjoy the rights of revision, essay writing, and reading guidance. The society is located on the first floor of the Chinese Vocational Education Society at No. 80, Hualong Road, Shanghai. Since the solicitation of members began, people have joined the society enthusiastically. It is truly a rare and valuable opportunity for young people who are interested in studying the national language in their spare time.</p>
<p>Guangxia Middle School: Guangxia Middle School moved to the intersection of Muerming Road and Fuxu Road this summer. Due to the excellent environment, management is more convenient.

The Chinese Education Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council has recognized that the school is run seriously and has awarded the school 10 scholarship places.

<p>The Launch of the Jintan Children's Library</p>
<p>Chen Fusheng of the Jintan academic community in Shanghai is extremely enthusiastic about social undertakings in his hometown. He first created a children's hygiene team two years ago. When it was first established, there were only more than 20 people. Last year, it increased to more than 500 people, which was deeply praised by Magistrate Qi and people from all walks of life. He then organized summer tutoring classes and advancement classes with the assistance of mathematician Hua Luogeng, and the results were excellent.

<h3>Little Men (7)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>When Little Ned brought the bottle over, his cheeks were red from exertion, so after Nat bravely took a dose, Mrs.裴 let him lick the spoon and used a piece of flannel to warmly wrap around Nat's neck.</p>
<p>〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>These preliminary treatments were not yet complete when suddenly, a bell rang, and a flurry of footsteps passed through the stairwell, indicating that it was dinnertime. Shy Nat trembled at the thought of meeting so many unfamiliar boys, but Mrs.裴 extended a hand to him, and Rob, with a protective air, said, "Don't be afraid; I'll look after you."</p>
<p>Twelve boys, six in each row, stood behind their chairs, eager to start eating immediately, and the tall youth playing the flute was trying to calm them down. However, no one sat down until Mrs. 装 was seated behind the teapot, and she pointed to Nat on her right, introducing him to everyone.</p>
<p>"This is our new boy, Bai Nai德. You can greet him after dinner. Be quiet, children, be quiet."</p>
<p>As she spoke, everyone stared at Nat before slipping into their seats, trying to be well-mannered, but the opposite happened. Mr. and Mrs. Pei did their best to ensure that the boys behaved well during meals, and they usually succeeded because their rules were simple and reasonable. The boys knew that the couple was helping them, seeking their happiness, and they tried their best to obey. However, at times, the hungry boys had a tendency that could only be restrained by force, especially on Saturday evenings after a half-day holiday.</p>

<h3>Our Davis Cup Player Xu Chengji Returned to Shanghai Yesterday and Will Perform in Shanghai for Two Days Before Returning to Java on the 15th</h3>
<p>Our Davis Cup player Xu Chengji and his manager Mr. Carlson returned to Shanghai yesterday on the American ship President Jefferson. The ship docked at the Bailianjing pier in Pudong at 9:00 am. Many tennis enthusiasts from Shanghai, including Lin Baohua, went to welcome them. Mr. Xu went to his residence at 137 Seymour Road to rest. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Impressions of America: Mr. Xu stated that his trip to the United States to participate in the Davis Cup tennis tournament was primarily for observation, so he didn't mind losing. After participating, he deeply felt the progress made by European and American countries in tennis skills in recent years. The Chinese tennis community urgently needs to catch up. His first thought after returning from the Davis Cup was that the Chinese tennis community cannot cooperate. In ordinary times, they can compete with each other, but during international competitions, they cannot cooperate. The promotion of tennis is even more urgent because it is a very noble and relatively simple sport. Both men and women, young and old, can learn from each other with two or more people. It is very common in European and American countries, whether in cities or villages. In China, only a small number of cities have this sport, and remote areas do not even know what tennis is. In the future, he hopes that the tennis community and the entire nation will vigorously promote it.</p>
<p>Scheduled Return to the South: When asked about the domestic circles eagerly hoping that he could perform in Shanghai for a few days to help the victims of the Yangtze and Yellow River floods, Mr. Xu said that he was very willing to help the disaster victims, but he was afraid that his time was limited and could not perform too much. It is reported that Mr. Xu is scheduled to return to Java on the 15th. A friendly match will be held on Saturday and Sunday. Tennis fan Chen Qihao has scheduled a tea party for tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 pm.</p>

<p>The market was flooded with large long positions exiting, short positions increased, and selling pressure dominated. The exchange rate weakened due to large sell orders, causing prices to plummet to below 890 yuan before stabilizing slightly. Early in the morning, news indicated that interest rates for the interim period were nearly flat for British banks but unchanged for American banks. Forward silver prices in Montreux were unchanged or slightly lower. Exchange rates rose slightly, and London spot gold increased by one penny. Confidence was difficult to restore. Furthermore, news reports quoted responsible officials from the Ministry of Finance firmly denying that the government was adopting inflationary policies. Dark market trading the previous evening had already fallen to 0.78 yuan, with many long positions being liquidated. However, yesterday's report stated that the government would be happy to accept proposals from business leaders and economists for stabilizing the currency, but that further study was needed. This news gave some people hope. As a result, pre-market trading opened yesterday morning and rose from 0.80 yuan to 1.12 yuan. Major firms such as Heng Yu Fu Xing Yong Shang Jin, and the Central Bank announced their official exchange rates, with British and American rates unchanged.

Han Heng Heng Chang Yong Lai actually declined slightly, and after opening, retreated to within the 910 yuan range.

Banks seized the opportunity to buy low, and Mobil also settled accounts, which helped to stabilize prices. It was learned that the HSBC exchange rate was unchanged, and prices rebounded briefly. Major Chinese firms such as Luo, Tong Feng Heng, etc., continued to sell, and many long positions were liquidated. However, because banks were still buying, and Hong Kong reported a weak 0.0625, prices hovered around 900 yuan. Later, buying interest weakened, selling pressure increased, and the downward trend intensified. As long positions exited and short positions increased, the 90 yuan mark was broken. There were forecasts that Indian silver would rise by one anna, but soon major firms saw the low prices and bought slightly. At noon, the market stabilized somewhat. After the market closed, prices remained stable. Unexpectedly, Wan Xing Hui Xiang Da Da all sold, and prices retreated into the 90 yuan range. After opening, there was a slight decline, but major firms bought on the dip, gradually rebounding to above 90 yuan. There was considerable fluctuation along the way.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Suffer Another Setback - Positive Six Down the Most at 0.89 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market had the potential to rebound, but due to the Luan County incident, the North Gang and numbers 4 and 16 sold off, while number 48 continued to absorb. The market initially fell and then stabilized. Yesterday's transactions included numbers 4, 16, and 21 selling, and number 48 buying. Market prices gradually declined. Demobilization fell sharply by 0.7-0.8 yuan, and the rest also fell by a small amount, 0.03-0.05 yuan. Positive Six fell by 0.8 yuan because number 48 did not need it, and 96 remained weak. The first round of trading was relatively strong, while the last round still felt fatigued and fell. Everyone still felt dazed. In summary, market prices ended up falling across the board, from 0.01-0.02 yuan to 0.09 yuan. Only this month's salt tax of 0.025 yuan was up. The total number of transactions was 10,037,500 yuan.

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton</h3>
<p>Silver Prices Plunge, Actual Sales Sluggish - Long Positions in Silver Yarn Closed Out</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the falling trend was extremely fierce. After the wild surge the day before yesterday, there was a sharp drop today. According to market rumors, a certain long position liquidated a large amount, reaching 5,000 to 6,000 bales. As a result, the market was flooded with chips, and market prices fell steadily. The reason was that after prices increased, actual demand from customers stagnated, and although finance was more active than before, the domestic economy remained depressed. The yarn market was prone to reversals.</p>
<p>Silver Yarn Drops Sharply by 3.50 Yuan This Month</p>
<p>Silver yarn opened in the morning with a slight increase in each month, but there were very few buyers in the market. Around the second or third round of bidding, a selling atmosphere suddenly arose, and the situation became very weak. Certain long positions were liquidated one after another, and the amount was huge, making it increasingly difficult for the market to sustain. At the close, rumors of silver price drops subsided. Sales of spot yarn were sluggish, and Japanese yarn accounted for the majority. The market was weak, and as a result, each month fell by 1.689-2.00 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was still weak, and the far months rebounded by several corners. However, long positions continued to be released, and Da Ji also came to sell. The second round of bidding was flat, and the far months fell again. In the third round, the near months fell sharply by more than one yuan, and the first three months all broke the 70 yuan mark. However, most buyers have not closed out, and their intentions are quiet. In short, sales were too sluggish, and as a result, each month fell by 1.47 yuan compared to the morning closing price, with the far months falling by 0.05-0.07 yuan. It was found that Da Fu sold 1,050 bales, Da Feng 2,650, Da Ji 3,000, Zhen Da 1,600, Geng Feng 850, Chang Feng 2,200, Tong He 1,250, Heng Chang 800, Xin Cheng 1,700, Rui Da bought 850, Tong Ji 3,250, Yi Da 1,200, Jin Chang 1,000, Sen Kang 600, Heng De 1,300, Run Kang 1,350. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Sales Only 300 Bales</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are becoming increasingly sluggish. It was found that the total amount bought by each gang throughout the day was 333 bales. Prices fell by more than one yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Long Positions in Cotton Maintained This Month</p>
<p>The cotton market for August was still soft with a hint of increase, as most long positions were holding tight. However, yarn mills have been shut down for a long time, and consumption has been greatly reduced. As for new cotton, due to good weather recently, silver prices have plunged, and most speculators have bought too much. Once there is a reversal, the falling trend will be even more severe. Furthermore, a certain gentleman sold a large amount of new cotton, reaching more than 15,000 piculs.</p>
<p>Selling Pressure in New Cotton is Especially Strong</p>
<p>The silver cotton market opened in the morning with each month rising by 0.15 yuan, but by the second and third rounds of bidding, due to the slump in the yarn market and the improved U.S. cotton harvest, exceeding 12 million bales, silver prices fell into the 900 yuan range. Selling pressure in the market was particularly strong, and the market fell step by step. As a result, each month fell by 0.04-0.05 yuan, but the long positions for this month were very strong, falling by only 0.005 yuan. The afternoon opening rebounded by 0.01 yuan, and by the second and third rounds of bidding, there was a sharp drop of 0.02-0.03 yuan. Da Ji came to sell a large amount again, adding a lot of pressure, totaling more than 8,000 piculs. However, most cotton merchants were holding tight on near months, but cotton yarn consumption was not smooth, and the raw cotton business was naturally sluggish. As a result, each month fell by another 0.01-0.02 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yi Chong sold 1,200 piculs, Da Ji 13,900 piculs, Geng Feng 2,000 piculs, Ren Feng 2,200 piculs, Chang Feng 4,800 piculs, Yuan Xing Chang 6,400 piculs, Shen Chang 2,800 piculs, Shen Ji 3,000 piculs, Yi Chang 2,400 piculs, Chang Yu bought 1,800 piculs, He Xing 2,800 piculs, Yuan Da 3,900 piculs, Yuan Yi 2,900 piculs, Da Chang Cheng 1,200 piculs, Run Kang 4,700 piculs, Da Chang 3,400 piculs, Tong He 1,500 piculs, Chang He 7,200 piculs, Ren Feng 3,200 piculs, Yi Kang 1,200 piculs. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Mill Demand Not Much</p>
<p>Raw cotton consumption is extremely sluggish. Mill demand is pure. The source is 1,186 bales of Yao cotton and 207 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 41.80 Shenxin Factory Received 140 Bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Bao Cotton 46.00 Shanghai Factory Received 165 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shaanxi Actively Promotes Cotton Planting - Cotton Fields Increased by 30% Compared to Last Year -</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province's Shaanxi cotton is most noteworthy this year. Because the authorities strictly prohibit opium and ordered a switch to cotton planting, the result was a significant increase in cotton fields. In addition, there was the convenience of diverting the Wei River for irrigation and opening wells in various places to store water. Furthermore, due to the promotion of cotton seeds, there was progress compared to last year, and the weather was also relatively favorable. Currently, it is estimated that 1.3 million piculs can be obtained, and cotton fields have increased by 30% compared to last year. The actual harvest last year was 1.04 million piculs.</p>

<p>Three-Grade Yarn Falls, Cotton Flattens</p>
<h3>Grain Market: Bulls Profit-Taking Led to Large Sales of Refined Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally tight initially, then weakened. The price of foreign wheat, quoted in Chicago, rose by about 67 points. There was no market for "Can Umbrella" (坎傘大). At the opening, market sentiment was quite bullish due to the rising foreign wheat prices. Bidding for various months was good, ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 cents. However, after the third round of trading, major bullish players engaged in significant profit-taking. Coupled with a sharp drop in gold prices, market sentiment further softened. Mills were not selling, and off-exchange sellers were also active, leading to a general decline. Nevertheless, spot trading remained lively. It was reported that over 40,000 bags of "cannon car" (砲車) flour were sold, with the price observed at 2.41 yuan. If sales remain strong, a significant decline in the near future is unlikely. Ultimately, the current month's price fell by 0.5 cents, September fell by 0.5 cents, October and November fell by 1.25 cents, December fell by 0.75 cents, and January fell by 0.25 cents.</p>
<p>Forward Wheat Market Experienced Hedging Sales by Brokers</p>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market was very active. Initially, sentiment was strong due to the rise of foreign wheat in Chicago by 67 points, with prices increasing by 23 cents compared to the previous day. After the second round, trading remained active, but due to the decline in gold prices, major bullish players took the opportunity to profit-take. Although the market did not change significantly, it was slightly down by 0.02 cents compared to the opening. The atmosphere in the contract months market was particularly weak due to hedging sales by brokers, leading to a sharper decline. Ultimately, August to November saw no change, December fell by 0.02 cents, and January fell by 0.04 cents. The spot wheat market is supported by good mill demand. Arrivals at the source are not yet strong, with each grade rising by 0.01 cents. Shandong wheat opened at 3.65 yuan, Yanghe wheat at 3.64 yuan, Guzhen wheat at 3.62 yuan, Jiangyan wheat at 3.57 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 3.58 yuan, Baoying wheat at 3.60 yuan, and Jiangxinzhou wheat at 3.50 yuan. Fuxin sold 3,000 bags, Fufeng sold 2,000 bags, and Shenda sold 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Local Imported Rice Sales Active, Prices Increased</p>
<p>The source of local rice (South Shanghai) suddenly became scarce yesterday, with only shipments up to the 13th or 14th (totaling 2,600-2,700 shi). Therefore, sentiment remained stable, and the market showed resilience again. However, the local market still had some activity, while only 200 bags of glutinous rice were handled by the Qingdao gang. As a result, the price of thick japonica rice saw a rise of 0.2 yuan, while thin indica rice only improved slightly. Dongxin japonica rice remained at the original price, and the price of "bian yin yuan" (變陰元) also showed strength.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various routes downstream reached the 13th and 14th. Trading of japonica and white rice continued to be active in the market in the morning, and prices rose by another 0.1-0.11 yuan. Later, due to weak retail demand, the market stabilized. Sales of thin indica rice were still good, with prices increasing slightly. Arrivals of Dongxin japonica rice exceeded 2,000 shi, and sales slightly improved, but prices remained stable. Retail trading of "bai yuan" (白元) was weak, and prices weakened again. There was little change in the prices of other grades.</p>
<p>The imported rice market continued to rise. Saigon No. 3 was contested between the local gang and the Jiujiang gang, causing the price to surge by another 0.1 yuan. The prices of all other imported rice continued to rise by 0.1-0.3 yuan. As downstream rice prices rose, local appetite shifted. Although there were no sales of Xiamen and Beiyang rice, demand in the interior, such as Nanjing and the Yangtze River region, remained active, especially in the local market. The total sales in the city were 10,755 bags of Saigon rice, 800 bags of "small twisted" (小絞) rice, and 1,500 bags of Siam rice. As merchants' inventories gradually decreased and new arrivals ceased, the outlook remained positive.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Market Surges by 50 Yen – Supply Unable to Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Recently, the silk market has been unusually excited, and aided by low exchange rates. Today, the Yokohama market surged by 50 yen, reaching the daily limit. The New York market also rose by 7 points. Overseas demand appears to be strong, and Japan has limited silkworm rearing this spring. Domestic cocoon production is also low. Based on this, it seems that supply is unable to meet demand. There have been many overseas orders today, but Shanghai's spot silk supply is lacking, and futures contracts have been sold off until October. Near-term futures are truly in high demand. Therefore, there were not many transactions in the morning. There should be a significant number of transactions in the afternoon, to be reported later. The New York raw silk inventory report for last month is as follows:</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Retreats, Red Sugar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight softening due to the decline in Guan Jin (關金), trending towards Guangdong. The association's initial bid for Grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar was down by 0.05 yuan. Several dozen bags were traded at 17.15 yuan, and later 300 bags were traded at 17.10 yuan, a total decrease of 0.1 yuan. Transit goods were traded at 5.60 yuan for 100-200 bags. Taiji Sugar B mark was quoted at 18.20 yuan, while Zhenyu No. 1 refined white sugar from local factories was quoted at 16.60 yuan. The bid for Hainan red sugar opened at 10.20 yuan for one hundred and several dozen bags, a rise of 0.2 yuan. Several dozen bags of Zheng Mian red sugar were traded at 12.20 yuan, also a rise of 0.6 yuan. Eastern white sugar also showed a weakening trend. J mark was quoted at 17.45 yuan and N mark at 17.15 yuan, but no transactions were made. Eastern red sugar remained at 13 yuan.</p>
<h3>Local Imported Sugar Inventory Increases</h3>

<h3>Dried Goods: Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>New Jiaxing Honey Dates Decline</p>
<p>Due to limited supply, the first batch of Xingxin honey dates opened at a high price of 28 yuan. As arrivals gradually increased, prices gradually declined. Yesterday, the lowest price reached 23 yuan, a total decrease of more than 5 yuan. Upward and downward adjustments are made as usual, and further price declines are possible in the future.</p>
<p>Orchid Bamboo Branches Surge by 3-4 Yuan</p>
<p>Sales of orchid bamboo branches have become active recently, and market sentiment has suddenly improved. It was heard that a portion has been sold, and the goods are still considered presentable. Prices have surged by 3-4 yuan compared to previous levels. Therefore, the difference between market quotations and opening prices is nearly 4 yuan, based on the morning sales.</p>

<h3>Sex and Art</h3>
<p>– Cheng Xuehong</p>
<p>Arishima Takeo said, "Love is what produces art." Indeed, the torrent of love beautifies the world. When people discover beauty, they create an idealized form of it as a symbol. The creation of art happens at this moment.</p>
<p>Historically, the germination of art originated from the cartoons, clothing, and tattoos of primitive peoples. According to Grooes, Australian aborigines carry a bag containing red, yellow, and white pigments when they go out. They proudly apply a few spots on their cheeks on ordinary days, and paint their bodies in various colors during wartime to intimidate the enemy. During festivals or victory celebrations, they apply colors all over their bodies to attract women. Red is suitable for both war and courtship, so it is the most valuable color. Therefore, there are tribes where people fight for weeks to obtain red pigment. Compared to women, men use more color; some tribes strictly prohibit unmarried women from applying color to their heads.</p>
<p>At Australian night dances, dancers often use white paint. In the Palti dance, both red and white are used. The Marrinyeri tribe decorates the bodies of the dead with bright red mineral earth. In short, the sole purpose of body painting in primitive times was to seek beauty.</p>
<p>A major drawback of using pigments is that they fade easily. Therefore, primitive tribes sought permanent art forms, creating aesthetic forms to increase their value.</p>
<p>Tattooing is the most common method. They pierce the skin with flints, shells, or other primitive knives to create patterns, then embed pigments underneath to make them last. In some Australian tribes, tattoos are mainly applied to the back, while in others they are applied to the wrists, chest, abdomen, and legs. This procedure is used on both sexes, but men's tattoos are often more extensive than women's. The styles of tattoos vary, including spots, curves, and straight lines. Sometimes the entire chest is covered with cuts (see "Natural History of Man" by Wood). The natives of the Torres Strait tattooed thick horseshoe-shaped scars on their shoulders, resembling military decorations; this is the most cruel primitive art.</p>
<p>The initial purpose of clothing was more decorative than practical. When Darwin saw a Fuegian native about to freeze to death and gave him a red garment, the native was overjoyed and tore it into strips, distributing them to his companions as decorations around their shivering legs, surprising Darwin. This is the same as the pursuit of beauty by modern women in the 20th century, who expose their chests and wear silk stockings even in the dead of winter.</p>
<p>The Eskimos in the Arctic also did not forget to decorate. They sewed colorful scraps of leather, teeth, bones, metal beads, copper bells, etc., onto their leather clothing. Women's clothing decorations are as complex as men's and include a loincloth (a dangling piece behind the back) that reaches the knees to distinguish them from men.</p>
<p>Civilization historians are dedicated to this fascinating work, explaining in plain scientific terms how great our cultural construction is for various states of civilized nations. They often consider the unevenness of this clothing and decoration to be an amusing example of the childish simplicity of those barbarians who cannot distinguish between the necessary and the unnecessary.</p>
<p>Since primitive people had considerable decoration on their bodies, they extended it to utensils. They painted colors on weapons and all daily stone tools and carved the beasts they longed to capture or the totems they jointly worshiped on the walls of caves to show their beauty.</p>
<p>Architecture originated from tombs. The oldest buildings in the world, the Egyptian pyramids, are tombs. The earliest chapels were shrines for the dead, where the living paid homage. Later, the tombs were gradually moved to nearby locations, but famous ancestors' tombs, such as Westminster Abbey, are still buried in the abbey. This simple chapel was the beginning of the temples that the Greeks built for Pallas Athene and the gods, and it was also the prototype of Gothic Cathedrals. In these temples, there were altars, which were sacred places for displaying the relics of the dead, their meaning similar to the original tombs.</p>
<p>Not only religious art must draw living sources from love to nourish its life, but other elements of creative art must also be combined with love. The beauty of rhythm and love are connected to produce dance, poetry, and music.</p>
<p>Primitive dance is the most direct, complete, and powerful expression of primitive aesthetic emotion. In dance, primitive people undoubtedly saw the most intense enjoyment of beauty that they could universally feel. That is to say, dance can grant sexual satisfaction. Hunting tribes usually have dances performed solely by men, while women only provide musical accompaniment. But there are also dances in which both men and women participate, which undoubtedly aim to arouse sexual desire.</p>
<p>Poetry is the verbal expression of internal or external phenomena in a form that achieves beauty for a certain aesthetic purpose. This definition includes subjective poetry, namely lyric poetry, which expresses internal phenomena - subjective emotions and ideas - and objective poetry, which expresses external phenomena - objective facts and events - in narrative and dramatic forms. In any case, its expression is solely for aesthetic purposes, meaning that the poet does not intend to stimulate behavior, but to appeal to emotions. Grey said, "Old Australians simply sing as a matter of course. They sing in anger, joy, and hunger. If they drink - unless they are so drunk that they lose consciousness - they sing even more."</p>
<p>Music, in its nature and influence among the arts, stands in an incomparable position, forming an independent art in itself. All other arts must be used for the purposes of life, while music is used entirely for the purpose of art. As Kubota Mantaro of Japan said, "A poet is like a child." In this sense, music can be called the purest art. Especially between music and poetry, although they have close connections on the surface, there exists a very deep internal contradiction. Poetry dominates the entire world of phenomena, while music itself can say, "My kingdom is not of this world."</p>
<p>The latent source of sexuality can nourish the artist's creative desire, and sometimes sexual love and art arise simultaneously. This is how the geniuses of the Romantic era were born. In these geniuses, imagination triumphed over reason, and sexual love and art simultaneously consumed them. Because the torrent of desire frequently surged, they were sensitive, passionate, devoted to fantasy, and without restraint. Their pain was also endless. They all walked extreme paths. Only by creating poetry, painting, music, and all philosophies of love can we follow them and express sympathy. At the same time, humanity is able to continue endlessly, and life is able to exist immortally, all thanks to this creative power.</p>
<p>"Art science must begin with the primitive art of primitive peoples." I believe this slogan of anthropologists.</p>
<h3>Elegant Pursuits of Distinguished Men – Composing Poetry by the Stream</h3>
<p>– Hu Kao</p>
<h3>University Days (39)</h3>
<p>– by Theodor Storm, translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>I circled around her and went to the earth-field, where I waited for her. Soon I saw the flash of white clothes and the sound of the girl's light steps, and then she stood before me, still catching her breath. - Now I am again with her, alone together in the darkness of the summer night; but this is another kind of situation. I had not yet spoken to her when she took out a roll of paper from her bag; at that moment another flash of lightning showed that it was a letter, and the stamp and sealing wax on the letter were also visible. "This is from Christopher," said Nali, and she put the letter in my hand when I involuntarily reached out for it.</p>
<p>"From Christopher"! I shouted, "When did you receive this letter"?</p>
<p>"Today"! She replied softly.</p>
<p>"Then you still ran here"?</p>
<p>She didn't answer.</p>
<p>"Can I see this letter, Nali"?</p>
<p>"I was just about to ask you to read it."</p>
<p>I walked behind the house to a window with light. Li slowly followed me; I felt that her eyes did not leave me while I read the letter.</p>
<p>It was a long letter. Christopher explained why he had not written for so long. He had taken over his uncle's business; but his relationship with this business was still wavering, because everything depended on whether his cousin could marry a wealthy chimney sweep master: when a fellow villager who was a tailor came to visit him, he was already busy making new furniture for the bridal chamber, but the marriage suddenly changed; now everything was finally settled, his cousin had already married, and he would soon be able to obtain master qualifications in a foreign country; so now he invited her to go there, because he had no time to come here to pick her up. "As soon as I receive your reply," the last paragraph of the letter said, "I will immediately send the travel expenses; these travel expenses have already been raised and stored separately. The house is easy to find; there is a linden tree next to the green wooden bench in front of the door, just like in your parents' house; the house that I arranged for this young master and mistress is completely shaded by this linden tree!"</p>
<p>I folded the letter and handed it back to her. But Nali shook her head. "Please write a letter to him, Mr. Fei Li"! she said, two tears flowing down her cheeks; she added in a low voice: "His kindness is very touching."</p>
<p>"So you don't want to go yourself"? I asked.</p>
<p>She looked at me with a pleading, desperate look that made me regret that I should not have asked her this question.</p>
<p>"Nali," I said, "can someone help you"?</p>
<h3>Our Levee Broke (Part 2)</h3>
<p>– Hei Ying</p>
<p>"I don't think it's stable like this," said a young man.</p>
<p>"Not stable? Who is talking"! Old Ba, who had his leg broken by a waterwheel last year, stopped his hoe and shouted.</p>
<p>"I'm saying it." The young man stood up straight and faced him. "Look at this, it's just dug up and not plastered. Why do we still need to pay for levee repairs? Where did that money go? Our work is for nothing"!</p>
<p>"Yes, let's ask Mr. Huang"!</p>
<p>"That guy is farting," Old Ba rushed forward and shouted.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Old Ba"? The young man went up to him, "You are also a commoner, and your wife and children are also behind the levee; if the levee is unstable and breaks, won't you suffer losses"?</p>
<p>"You speak so nicely! Then isn't Mr. Huang's house also behind the levee? Does he hope that the water will flood his big house? His property..."</p>
<p>"His property is in Shanghai, you know"? The young man replied calmly, smiling. "Don't you remember, he always runs away to escape from the bad rumors! Who is suffering in the end? Who is it"!</p>
<p>"That's right! Who is it"! I said sarcastically to Old Ba, whose face was turning green, feeling much more relieved.</p>
<p>The engineer rushed up and shouted. We all stopped working together and asked him to make the levee stronger. He went back to Mr. Huang to discuss; afterwards, armed soldiers specially sent down from the county were stationed to monitor everyone...</p>
<p>"The levee was indeed not repaired very strongly," the storyteller continued, and gradually got to the point, using gestures to help his expression. In the summer, it rained for half a month, and the upstream of the river rushed the water downstream. We inspected the levee bank, and heavens, it had reached a very critical state. Mr. Huang, he didn't care how anxious you were, he said he was writing a memorial to the superiors, waiting for the relief funds to be sent - but two days later he secretly slipped away to the county town and took the money"!</p>
<p>"Is it really so hateful"? Someone asked angrily.</p>
<p>"How could it not be true, afterwards Huang's family workers all followed him." He also expressed indignation. "I went back home just scratching my head, not knowing what to do with my wife. My sixty-year-old mother was sick in bed, if our levee broke, it would be really - one night, the night was so quiet that there was not a sound, and the rain cleared up; but lying in bed I could not sleep all night, my heart was jumping like crazy. Someone was watching the levee; but I seemed to hear the distant sound of a bell ringing several times, and I suddenly got up, scaring her pale. "There is no gong sound: there is no sound at all, you sleep quietly." But how could I fall asleep."</p>
<p>"Then what happened to your levee in the end"?</p>
<p>"It broke - in the middle of the night there was indeed a sad and urgent gong sound warning that the water had broken through the levee and was surging towards the village. People's voices became noisy, mixed with the cries of children, and the whole village was plunged into extreme terror. My wife and I quickly got up to help my mother, and also had to carry a large bag on our backs, and ran out in one breath. There were torches everywhere outside, and countless figures moving south. We struggled out of danger like this…"</p>
<p>"What about your mother"?</p>
<p>"She died on the road." He sighed and said. "Think about it, an old woman of sixty, who was already sick in bed, was forced to move by the water, and worried about her home being flooded, how could she not… not…"</p>
<p>A tear of remembrance for his home and mother dripped down, and the storyteller stopped speaking. He had struggled to escape here to find his cousin; but his cousin was a worker in a yarn factory, and a thatched hut cost fourteen yuan to rent - how could he maintain their lives with a salary that might be discounted? So he held his heavy head in his hands, sitting silently on the hot summer street, clenching his teeth, thinking of the fact that the levee broke, he could only sigh.</p>
<h3>A List of One Hundred Drum Songs by Zhang</h3>
<p>– Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Recently I saw the "Bibliography Studies" Vol. 4, No. 4 of the Japan Bibliographical Society, which contains a "List of Old Manuscript Drum Songs in My Collection" by Nagasawa Norihito, which lists 53 manuscript volumes of drum songs initially published by Baibenzhangtang (百本張堂). All of them were recorded in the "Baibenzhang Bibliography" (百本張書目). Baibenzhang was established during the Qianlong period, and this initial bibliography represents the drum songs popular during the Qianlong era. Many of them are now difficult to find. At least, some of the following species are not very popular; or to be more accurate, I have never seen them personally:</p>
<p>One Hundred Mountain Names, One Hundred Bird Names, One Hundred Black, Tenfold Grace, Mengzheng Hurrying for斋, Mengzheng Offering Sacrifices to the Stove, Thirteen Months of Ancient People's Names, Twelve Months of Ancient People's Names, Continuous Promotion of Three Ranks (two volumes), Liu Skilled Doctor Visiting the Sick, Door Gods Zao Wang Suing Merits, Mulian Monk Saving His Mother, Opera Troupe Names, Nine-Nine Chart of Ancient People's Names, Fisherman's Profit, The Most Joyful Spring Scenery, Exhortation to the World, Little Boy Hoeing the Ground, Two Eight Beauties, "A Floating Cloud Covers the Sky", First-Rank Official at Court, Fifteen Teardowns, Clever Little Girl, Confused Ancient People's Names, March Peach Blossoms Ten Landings, Encountering a Monk, Ten to One Hundred Watching Flowers, Begonia Blooming, Mother-in-law and Sister-in-law Offering Incense, June Three伏, Eight Difficulties, 彩樓配</p>
<p>The above 24 books obviously have a characteristic, that is, they rarely use historical subjects. Only "Mengzheng Hurrying for齋", "Mengzheng Offering Sacrifices to the Stove", "Mulian Monk Saving His Mother", "彩樓配", and "Liu Skilled Doctor Visiting the Sick" are based on old folk stories. This is very different from the drum songs that were popular after the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, such as "Three Kingdoms", "Water Margin", and "Dream of the Red Chamber". Perhaps at that time, drum songs had not yet occupied the stage, but were just "walking the streets" and singing what was later called "civilized little tunes". The remaining 19 books still have lead-printed editions circulating, which are listed below, with annotations of the books they are found in and their publishing houses:</p>
<p>The following is from "Civilized Drum Song Lyrics", published by Beiping Zhonghua Printing Bureau, a total of 25 volumes. Each book is noted below the title:</p>
<p>(1) Luo Cheng Divining Fortunes (Vol. 8) (2) Luo Cheng Entrusting Dreams (Vol. 17)</p>
<p>(3) Changban Slope Two Volumes (Vol. 15) (4) Ten Loves Exaggerating Husband (Vol. 5)</p>
<p>(5) The Grand Assembly (Vol. 4) (6) Bao Gong Exaggerating Mulberry (Vol. 5)</p>
<p>(7) Han Xin Asking About Luck (Vol. 5, but titled "Han Xin Divining Fortunes")</p>
<p>(8) Eight Immortals (Vol. 12, but titled Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity, not sure if it is).</p>
<p>The Grand Assembly and Ten Loves Exaggerating Husband also have small thin volumes published by Beiping Baowentang. The following are all from Baowentang edition:</p>
<p>(9) One Hundred Flower Names (no "儿" character) (10) One Hundred Insect Names (no "儿" character)</p>
<p>(11) Green Vegetable Names (no "儿" character) (12) Wine, Sex, Money, and Qi</p>
<p>(13) To Pick Up Inverted Reversal (14) Distant View of Azure Mountains One Stone</p>
<p>(15) First and Fifteenth Temple Gate Open (16) 蝍蟟 Divining Fortunes</p>
<p>(17) Beauty Playing with Parrot</p>
<p>A brief explanation is needed for the last five volumes. 蝍燎 Divining Fortunes is written as Grasshopper Divining Fate, One to Pick Up Inverted Reversal is written as Ten-Character Inverted Curtain, and Beauty Playing with Parrot is written as Parrot Matching Poems, not knowing if they are the same or different. "Distant View of Azure Mountains One Stone" is the first line of "Dislike the Poor and Love the Rich" (岔曲), and "First and Fifteenth Temple Gate Open" is the first line of "Prostitute Suing".</p>
<p>I hope this short article can be of some use for the exploration of the historical development of drum songs.</p>

<h3>Various Suicides</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>The growing trend of suicide did not begin today. Whether it's solitary, in pairs, entire families, or in groups; and the methods include self-slaughter, poisoning, drowning, jumping from buildings… and so on, all are directly and vividly annihilating one's own life, destroying one's survival functions. This is such a cruel and inhumane thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the very beginning of suicide, it has attracted the attention of society. Great arguments, brilliant insights, admonitions, prevention methods – everyone has been discussing them enthusiastically. Moreover, according to reports, "In recent years, the social economy has been depleted, unemployment is increasing daily, and suicide incidents occur daily… Finding ways to prevent this is truly essential. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in light of this, has specially instructed the department to create cautionary illustrations depicting the pain of suicide, producing dozens of large-format pieces to be posted throughout the city in public places on roads, lanes, ports, wharves, riverbanks, and bridges in prominent locations, in order to warn those citizens who are momentarily pessimistic and contemplating suicide." After this, we believe that under such startling and "Turn Back is the Shore"-style large-format illustrations, "perhaps" the rate of fifty-four suicide incidents every half-month can be significantly reduced. However, what the eventual effect will be remains to be proven by the facts.</p>
<p>However, the so-called "suicide," generally speaking, only refers to the active aspect – directly destroying one's survival functions; indirectly shocking and causing people to avert their eyes. However, in addition to this, there are many other kinds of "suicide" methods, but they are not as likely to attract attention. This method can be called "passive suicide" and "chronic suicide."</p>
<p>The "philosophy of life" of "doing the work of one day like a monk striking the bell for one day" is very common in today's society. Moreover, there are even more people who embrace the "art of living" of sitting in "bitter meditation," drinking "clear tea," and "talking about ghosts." In this, they appear "pure," "elegant," to the point of resembling monks and nuns who have seen through the "red dust" and entered the "empty gate." However, strictly speaking, under this state of "getting by," they are waiting for the arrival of the final day of fate, which is also suicide.</p>
<p>As for ordinary young people, entering society, encountering cruel reality, and failing, becoming disappointed, and then discouraged, feeling sad, and becoming decadent... although they may not "immediately harbor thoughts of厌世," they will nevertheless become mentally disordered and abnormal. This is also suicide. Some live their lives in sadness and isolation, others enter places of decadent pleasure, indulging in paper and gold, to squander their youth and destroy their lives. The so-called "pessimistic literature," or "happy literature," and even "fatalism," can all be categorized as a type of suicide.</p>
<p>As for the larger picture, even more so when the nation's difficulties are imminent, those who sing loudly about "dancing to save the nation" with "entertainment not forgetting to save the nation" can also be said to be performers in this category.</p>
<p>Moreover, the madhouses are becoming overcrowded; eight or nine out of ten young people are sallow and emaciated, suffering from neurasthenia, and even lung disease stage ×, can it not be said that there is a direct relationship with this?</p>
<p>However, this is not accidental either. In today's bleak and desolate society, only the performance of "chronic suicide" or "passive suicide" is cultivated. In the realm of "active suicide," there are now "passive prevention methods" to "remedy" it. It is not known what "method" will be used to save those who are engaging in "passive suicide."</p>
<h3>Summer Night at the Bay</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The thermometer has risen to over ninety degrees, and the city everywhere seems like a huge furnace spewing out hot and stuffy air. The sun seems to be stagnant all day, baking the earth. There is not a single breeze in the sky, and the white clouds are motionless, lingering on the edge of the sky. Under such hot weather, the asphalt on the road is melting, sending out white smoke. The leaves are sleeping, lifeless. A pedestrian walks by, drenched in sweat like a drowned chicken. Even dogs are lying tired under the shade of trees, stretching out their tongues, their bellies constantly rising and falling as they pant.</p>
<p>Indoors, the walls are hot, and the floors and everything else are emitting hot air. People living inside are dripping oil, as if ducks were put in an oven to roast. Humans who value politeness and have a sense of shame, men and women, in such weather, seem to have forgotten politeness and shame, shedding the nature of clothed animals. Everyone is baring their chest and back, exposing their arms and legs. If society were completely free, everyone would be happy to return to nature. The thin and short fabrics covering the flesh all feel as if they are carrying a thousand pounds of weight.</p>
<p>The island port, with mountains and water, although not as hot as the northern cities in summer, the long duration of the hot weather makes people feel depressed and miserable, just as the long duration of winter in the north makes people feel the terrible cold. Therefore, the people living in such a hot island city, except for a group who fight against heat and cold year-round for a living, everyone is seeking all kinds of comfortable, cool, and relief from the stuffy lifestyle in such steamy time.</p>
<p>People with leisure are clever and happy. During the day, although the heat makes them pant and sweat, they have already embarked on the path of happiness when the sun sets in the west and the western sky is still illuminated by a red glow.</p>
<p>The deep blue bay, the water is quietly still, without a single wave. Occasionally, a steamboat enters the port, the waves trailing from the stern of the ship, glowing in the light of the red clouds, are like pulling a scarlet golden chain. The water, heated by the sun, gradually cools down; a slight sea breeze blows from afar, like the goddess of liberty breaking the shackles for people, making people comfortable and intoxicated.</p>
<p>Countless small steam boats and sculling boats surrounding the Queen's Pier, each carrying young women and men, are sailing towards the vast bay. The city seems to be a bin for these people, group after group being spit out from all directions to the pier, and then carried onto the sea by small boats. Waves of perfume and laughter drift across the entire bay.</p>
<p>On the sea liner, it is also beginning to liven up. The joy of men and the smiles of women, which are not seen during the day, are overflowing everywhere at this time. The thick sound of the engine seems unable to break their whispers. All feelings of love seem to have been suppressed by the day's misery and are now being poured out endlessly under this great nature.</p>
<p>The stars in the sky twinkle, as if they feel the misery of the day like people and shine brighter in the night sky. The line of long snakes on the island city, the buildings circling around the mountainside, are flashing with colorful lights everywhere. In the shadows of the lights, people are living a short, happy night life, just like the people at sea. The dark sea surface is also illuminated by the scattered lights in the small boats.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The city, the southern city on a summer night, is a happy, bright, and extraordinary land of joy for people. Everything in the world belongs to them.</p>
<h3>Loan Shark Boss</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>—Contemporary Biographical Sketches</p>
<p>At dusk, because of the heat, everyone moves their dinner outside to eat. Thus, under this dim sky, in this hot air (filled with the smell of sweat, the clamor of conversations, and the crying of children), the small alley suddenly shakes off the fatigue of the day and reveals another noisy expression! People who work in factories, run errands in shops, do small business on the bustling streets, after a day's labor, all rely on this time, before putting their tired bodies on narrow and bedbug-infested beds, to chat idly, talk about serious matters of life, and discuss the obscene stories that unfold in the city every day, while nodding greetings to neighbors, amidst the noise of women and children, and also talk about "national affairs" and people's "private matters," laughing for a while, and sighing like rain – in this way, they temporarily pass a hard day, and at the same time, prepare to exchange essential labor for the life of the next day.</p>
<p>Just then, at the narrow entrance of the alley, came a tall man, wearing a "xiangyunsha" gown inside out, with the buttons undone; seeing this, most of the people in the alley (all those people whose income earned by labor is not enough to support their families and who must use the terrifying "loan shark money" to "supplement" it) were shocked, and suddenly remembered that today is the end of the month, yes, clearly, it is the end of the month, isn't this the "loan shark boss" coming to collect interest?</p>
<p>The "loan shark boss," straddling his huge body into the entrance of the alley, nodded vaguely to everyone; then, using his eyes, he called the names of his "debtors" in this alley one by one, while reaching into the pocket of his "xiangyunsha" gown, and pulling out a small, dirty, old-fashioned wallet: "It's time to collect the interest."</p>
<p>In this alley, there are quite a few families who, because the money they earn is not enough to "cover expenses," borrow "loan shark money" from the "loan shark boss," ranging from three or five yuan to twenty or thirty yuan (at a monthly interest rate of six and a half percent). They borrow because their daily money is not enough, and they are forced to take this "poisonous road." If they have to extract a portion of their already insufficient income every month to pay such heavy interest, of course it is not a very easy thing! Because of this, people feel a heavy weight in their hearts, like a large stone falling, every time they see the "loan shark boss" at the end of the month, and the "loan shark boss" knows very well that collecting this amount of interest every month is not an easy task, and he has to spend some words, cause some trouble, and finally, even resort to some small "tricks"!</p>
<p>Yes, "the world is bad, and people's hearts are not as good as before" (the loan shark boss sometimes sighs like that)! Greedy for a little interest, risking a large capital, this business of lending money is really not easy to do. If you don't have "tricks," if things go wrong, not only will you not get the interest, but even your "capital" will be lost, "these people are not good people! If I don't have some tricks, hum…"</p>
<p>Indeed, times are difficult, and people cannot repay the interest, that is the reality; but the loan shark boss's "tricks" are also the reality. He has his "old man," his brothers in the "gang," and also his subordinates; moreover, his "tricks" are known to the residents in this area.</p>
<p>Because of this, when the loan shark boss walked into the entrance of this alley, people remembered that it was the end of the month, and also remembered fear and sorrow; therefore, they had to take out the money for tomorrow's rice, some even took off their gowns to pawn them, some requested a day or two of grace because they really couldn't come up with "cash" at the moment, and some pleaded about their miserable circumstances, knowing full well that they would not be pitied – talking, scolding, cursing, explaining, pestering, all kinds of unpleasant tones mixed together, along with the boss's loud scolding, filled this small alley, and also filled the hearts of the people who were tossed and turned under the iron hands of usury, like sandbags at the mouth of a trench, and gravel stagnant at the bottom of the water.</p>
<p>Then, the boss frowned, scolding angrily, while counting the interest money that people "handed over," and stamped each one on the wallet with a red stamp, and then, without any slack, he turned to another group of people to confirm the exact date of payment.</p>
<p>"You say it, you say it! What day will you take it out, if you don't pay, it doesn't matter if you explain it; I, the boss, have been doing this business for more than a year or two! You can play tricks, but I also have my tricks! I… hum…"</p>
<p>Pressing and pressing, after getting a reply, he swayed out of the alley, turned a corner, and his huge figure disappeared.</p>
<p>However, people felt as if the loan shark boss's heavy footsteps were stepping on them. Day after day, he lives like that…</p>
<h3>Peddler</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>Carrying a load on his shoulders, he walks from the main street to the small alleys, from the market towns to the villages. Every day, he drags his tired shadow and raises his dry voice, hawking the sundries in his load. —This load is the burden of life, bending his shoulders. The summer afternoon sun, like a fiery umbrella, covers the green fields. The yellow dog under the shade of the tree is also panting, sticking out its tongue. He carries his load, dripping with sweat, walking on that rugged village path. Seeing black-tiled houses and gray-white earthen walls in the mulberry forest embracing in front, he knows it is another village. Perhaps he can find customers there. The bell in his hand rings, shouting in a hoarse voice like a dull knife cutting things: "Foreign goods… Anyone want foreign goods? —Foreign socks, towels, soap, printed cloth. Anyone want…" Walking into that village, the first to welcome him is the mad barking of mangy dogs. The men may have all gone to the fields to work, and the old and young women cannot stand the dampness and heat in the house, so they sit on the square in front of the house; a tattered mat is spread on the ground, letting the children roll and sleep on the tattered mat, while they do their work in their hands. The ringing of the bell, the barking of the dogs, and the tempting call for customers naturally arouse their attention. Their eyes all look at the peddler. He carries a pair of small cabinets, and through the glass doors, you can see the things inside. Really, snow-white towels, pink and tender yellow foreign socks, colorful gauze, clever and cute miscellaneous items, soap, buttons, needles, and threads, everything is there. He is simply carrying a beautiful department store. All those things are what they yearn for on weekdays; they also know that the things on the load are cheaper than in the store, and it is easier to bargain. Flames of envy flicker in their eyes, but when they think of money, they think of how yesterday the men went to town, spent three-tenths of the interest, and begged earnestly to borrow five yuan, only to buy the fertilizer needed for cultivation now. They can only let their eyes be greedy.</p>
<p>The peddler is also clever. He cannot allow himself to have driven so many roads under the poisonous sun, but not sell a penny's worth of goods to go back. He rests his load under an old elm tree, taking off his old straw hat from his head and fanning his sweat and dust-covered face. But he calls out to them: "Auntie, want some good… Girl, this beautiful…" The young women all put down the work in their hands and gathered in front of his load, flipping through this and looking at that. Their voices are as jumbled as fried broad beans, asking the prices of everything, making it impossible for him to answer. Their bargaining mouths are even more sharp, as if they want him to give them away for free to be satisfied; difficult life, lack of money, they really want to see four words from a penny. As a result, the things in the cabinet were turned into a mess by them, and the transaction, only an old lady, spent two copper coins to buy a pack of needles. Those women, although envied around him, always reluctant to money. He was also not happy, because now such years see, whether to the town of that alley, the countryside of that village, all like this. From the morning to pick up the burden to go out, all day in doubt, today can be sold to a copper plate. But regardless of whether it is sold or not, he will have to live, he will eventually have to carry the burden of life to run around, he will eventually have to endure the suffering of life. Now the moment of rest in the shade of the small village tree is when he is the only happiness. So he asked a woman for a cup of cold tea, wiped the sweat and dust from his face with the corner of his clothes, and chatted with them. Naturally, the result of the conversation, everyone is sighing this year's children. …</p>
<p>The sun is about to set, and his day's run, a shoulder of heavy burden, has made him exhausted. But the load is still full and heavy, just like when he went out in the morning. He tenderly shook the bell in his hand, anyway, at this time there is no business to do. On the desolate village path, under the dim sunset, he returned to the town step by step, calculating a day's business, he can only bite his lips, but called dry throat, can not issue a sound. To the Buyun Bridge, it is already the market end, the lights of the town are sparsely decorated with dusk. He put down the burden, rested on the bridge railing for a while, and temporarily enjoyed the evening wind on the river. He thought of the dark home, maybe there is no light yet.</p>

<p>Tears fall before I can speak. The suffering of the disaster area is endless. I advise the good folks of the blessed land, don't dislike the nagging, listen to me. I dare not be envious and jealous. I just ask everyone to show sympathy. You live in peace in high halls and mansions. Who knows, there is endless suffering in the thatched huts. You wear fur coats and hats and still complain about the cold. Alas, barefoot and bareheaded are the miserable people. You have fish and meat for three meals a day. Alas, tree bark and grass roots are used as snacks. You have the joy of parents and children. Alas, flesh and blood separation, nowhere to find. You, the blessed people enjoy the blessings in the blessed land. We are born out of time as disaster victims. You know the rabbit died and the fox was sad. It hurts the most when things hurt their kind. Saving a life is a small feat. It is not a light crime to stand idly by. I beg you to generously donate money. I beg you to save clothes and food and do good deeds. I beg you to think about it yourself. I beg you not to take the lives of your compatriots lightly. I beg you, don't let your heart be as hard as iron. I beg you, show compassion and express sympathy. Alas, my stomach is hungry and my body is cold. Alas, I am dying in the disaster. Alas, I cried out for help and no one responded. Alas, I can't survive the imminent crisis. shout a sound. Good folks. Cry out a sound. Good sir. Saving a life is like putting out a fire. It should not be seen to die without saving. I think I am. My voice is tired and my throat is light. When I want to shout again, there is no sound. Help, help, teach me quickly.</p>

<h3>"INSTANT LOVE" PREMIERES</h3>
<p>Shi Benqu Laisai, the hero of "Twenty Thousand Years in Prison" and "Heaven Collapses and Earth Cracks," now co-stars for the first time with Wendi Palichu, a beautiful rising British starlet, in a so-called streamlined romance portraying 1935. They engage in numerous amorous and playful adventures in an extremely tiny world that barely accommodates you and me. As for the humorous insertions, the elegant scenery, the ingenious structure, and the lively and vivid sentiments, those are mere trifles in comparison to the rest of the film. This is truly an excellent and refreshing treat for young people immersed in the intoxication of love, and it is now being shown at the "Nanjing" cinema. The two leads of the film are on the left.</p>
<h3>MAGNIFICENT MICROPHONE BROADCAST</h3>
<p>Cheng Bu Gao's audio masterpiece "Night Blooming Jasmine," Hu Die's first work after returning to China (two-thirds of it was filmed before she went abroad), is said to be nearing completion. This is a sound film worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Xu Lai went to the Sports Garden yesterday to swim and was photographed extensively by Zhang Jinde, Chen Jiazhen, and others. The photos taken by Zhang Jinde will all be published in "Star Bi-Monthly."</p>
<p>In addition to working hard on filming "The Big Family," Zhang Shichuan is preparing his new work "Peach Blossoms After the Disaster."</p>
<p>Long Jianong, Wang Weixin, Wang Shizhen, and others practice tennis in the sun every morning, not stopping until noon. It is said that they are working so hard to prepare to organize a tennis team.</p>
<p>Since Gu Lanjun was praised by the Guanshengyuan Farm as the "Goldfish Beauty," the "Goldfish Paradise" has now invited her to perform the opening ceremony on the 6th (Sunday). Her elegant title of "Goldfish Beauty" is truly well-deserved.</p>
<h3>CHINA ODDS AND ENDS</h3>
<p>The "Water Country Spring and Autumn" Kaifeng location shooting team originally planned to return to Shanghai around the 5th of this month, but according to a telegram, there have been torrential rains in the area for days, so they fear they will have to wait a few more days.</p>
<p>The China Film Studio colleagues remaining in Shanghai invariably raise film technology questions for discussion after dinner every night, and they change the topic every night, aiming to use their spare time to make improvements in film technology. The clerk Kang Jingqiu records everything for future reference.</p>
<p>"Water Country Spring and Autumn" will include several songs to enhance the power of the drama.</p>
<p>China Film Studio cameraman Shi Shipan has now completed a labor drama script with workers' lives as the background.</p>
<p>China Film Studio colleagues will organize an amateur club to solve the problem of leisure activities.</p>
<p>Ms. Yan Qun, the Mandarin professor at China Film Studio, is not only a good singer but also a good dancer.</p>
<p>It is expected that Zhao Zhenni's healthy and beautiful posture in "Water Country Spring and Autumn" will break the general audience's psychology of worshiping weak female stars in recent years.</p>
<h3>INTRODUCING "LITTLE ANGEL"</h3>
<p>"Movies are good educational tools," is a universally recognized truth by leaders from all walks of life in the country, and Mr. Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, is the strongest advocate among them.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen has continuously promoted this aspect, and the development of educational film undertakings in Zhenjiang is a clear proof of this.</p>
<p>In the past, Mr. Chen has compiled various film scripts for various companies to produce. Recently, in order to gather more ideas, he has openly solicited scripts.</p>
<p>Among the scripts solicited by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, "Angel" was selected as the first-place winner.</p>
<p>Using this winning script, and after extremely careful deliberation, the "Little Angel" of today was successfully created.</p>
<p>Because of the special achievements of Lianhua Film Company in the Chinese film industry, the Provincial Government handed this script over to Lianhua to produce.</p>
<p>With Wang Renmei, Lin Chuchu, Tang Tianxiu, and Li Junpan, these first-class actors, and with Wu Yonggang, one of the most promising directors, directing, it is enough to prove how excellent this play is.</p>
<p>What is even more noteworthy is the new child star Ge Zuozhi in this film, because of his excellent achievements in "Black Heart Charm," Lianyi specifically invited him from Hong Kong to contribute to the success of this play.</p>
<p>"Little Angel" is a story of the joys and sorrows of a small world, with extremely strong emotions, even the most subtle accidents, but occurring in this small world, will have extremely great moving power.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this play, Wang Renmei's loving affection between siblings will move people to tears.</p>
<p>You will immediately feel that this is the noblest and most authentic emotion of mankind.</p>
<p>"Little Angel" is a play with the most authentic emotions and noble sentiments.</p>

<h3>DEATH OF FRENCH AUTOMOBILE KING CITROËN</h3>
<p>— (Shadow Idiot)</p>
<p>French automobile king M. Andre Citroën passed away suddenly in a hospital in Paris on July 3rd of this year. The news was transmitted, and it truly caused people in the automotive industry throughout the world to express their sorrow. Citroën was only 57 years old. Not a very old age. In theory, he could have lived for several more years. He had been suffering from his illness for quite some time. Until recently, it was due to stomach cancer. After the doctor performed surgery, unexpectedly, it resulted in his passing away. Citroën's death not only caused a major blow to the French business world, but even had a considerable impact on the whole of Europe. Because after the European War, Citroën himself truly made great contributions to the business world. When we think back, at the end of last December, the Citroën factory he founded was, for a time, ineffective due to the impact of the economic downturn. There was news of an impending liquidation. Later, the government provided assistance, so it was able to overcome the difficulties and avoid bankruptcy. Who knew that not long after, although the Citroën factory is now operating reluctantly, the owner, Citroën, passed away. His death is undoubtedly a major loss for the French automotive industry.</p>
<p>Citroën was born on February 5, 1878. In his early years, he received military training in the heavy artillery and engineering corps. At that time, he was indeed a student to be noted. His success in military school enabled him to serve in the army after graduation. But although he was a promising military man, in his heart, he very much wanted to take a chance in the business world and independently establish a factory.</p>
<p>After completing his term of service in the heavy artillery corps, he began to establish a small factory in 1901, manufacturing the "Citroën Conveyor." This machine was invented by him himself. Initially, his small factory only employed ten workers and one pattern maker. He himself held several positions as designer, technician, business operator, and director. He was extremely busy, but his enterprise had already achieved considerable success from the beginning. In 1908, he joined the Mors factory's board of directors, reorganized the Mors factory, and affiliated it with the Citroën company. Even the production methods and market promotion were completely changed. As a result, his products soon increased tenfold in sales, and he himself gained many important experiences at that time.</p>
<p>Later, the European War broke out. He served in the 82nd Heavy Artillery Corps of the Army and had already obtained the rank of lieutenant. In 1915, he announced a plan for mass-producing munitions. Two months later, he founded a gunpowder factory in the Joefre area. That factory was affiliated with the Citroën Corporation, a very large factory. It could manufacture 50,000 shells every day. Soon, it increased to 55,000 shells. At the same time, he also contributed two new systems: the distribution of coal and the control of bread.</p>
<p>After the European War ended and the Treaty of Versailles was signed, he began to manufacture 10-horsepower Citroën cars. At first, in order to make it popular, the manufacturing method was very simple. By 1919, his car factory could already manufacture 30 cars a day. In 1924, it was 400 cars a day. In 1930, it was 600 cars. In 1933, it was 1,000 cars. At that time, he adopted a promotional method that was entirely sold by independent distributors. Their vehicles had showrooms everywhere. In addition, he worked hard on advertising. Whether it was on walls or on walkways, there were advertisements for the Citroën factory everywhere. In his lifelong career, the most worthy of our praise was that he had funded three expeditions, allowing them to complete their work in the study of natural science.</p>
<p>In 1933, the Citroën factory introduced a completely new type of car chassis, but from March 1934, the factory's economic situation was very difficult, almost to the point of bankruptcy. In December of the same year, there was even talk of liquidation. Fortunately, government assistance was obtained, so they were able to overcome the difficulties. Since then, the Citroën factory has been reorganized again, reducing its scope, saving expenses, and operating reluctantly. But recently, his death has made the future of the Citroën factory even gloomier. Of course, it is a major loss for the French automotive industry.</p>
<h3>OVERSEAS AUTOMOBILE NEWS SUMMARY</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Gutelich Creates Bulletproof Tires - The police departments and law enforcement agencies of various countries, as well as various automobiles used in military affairs, in addition to having the general special qualities and advantages, also need the function of being bulletproof. Automobiles used in this way travel at very high speeds. Therefore, solid tires are often unsuitable. The tires needed for these vehicles, in addition to having the resilience of pneumatic tires, must also have materials that can resist punctures. The Gutelich Company is a master in manufacturing tires. They have now created a new type of sponge rubber filling. All the points required in these situations can be satisfactorily addressed. After unexpectedly being hit by gunfire, these tires using rubber filling cannot be completely useless. Because there are only a few small air pockets in the punctured area, the remaining sponge can still generate elastic force towards the wheel rim to support the entire vehicle. Therefore, unless the entire tire is completely ruptured and damaged and this sponge rubber filling no longer exists, the operation of the tire will not be affected.</p>
<p>More Tourists Visiting Quebec - According to statistics from the Quebec Provincial Tourism Bureau in Canada, the number of tourists traveling to Quebec has increased. This is enough to show that the reason why Americans tend to go to Canada is not because of the issue of unrestricted alcohol, which is just a coincidence. In the summer of 1934, when the United States first opened its alcohol ban, there were 370,000 cars traveling from the United States to Quebec Province. Other transportation methods such as trains, ships, and buses were also more successful than in 1933. Currently, the highways in Quebec Province are said to have reached 16,000 kilometers. This is also a reason for the increase in tourists.</p>
<p>Production Volume of Williams Wowland Cars - The Williams Wowland factory in Toledo, USA, has recently greatly increased the number of cars it manufactures. According to Mr. Achu, the sales manager of the factory, the factory produced 7,500 cars in 1934. But in the first seven months of 1935, its production volume could reach 18,000 cars. This number will double compared to 1934. It is also reported that the factory will produce another 10,000 cars in the coming months.</p>
<p>General Motors Earns Profit - In the second quarter of this year, the net profit adjusted by General Motors was US$49,925,000, totaling US$1.17 per common share. At the same time last year, it was US$37,973,000, or $0.88 per share. The net profit earned by General Motors in the first six months of this year totaled US$79,141,000, with earnings per share of US$1.85. At the same time in 1934, it was US$64,998,000, with earnings of US$1.51 per share. The value of General Motors cars sold in the second quarter of 1935 was US$343,209,000, while it was US$309,706,000 at the same time in 1934. The value of vehicles sold in the first half of this year was US$594,884,000. At the same time last year, it was US$519,678,000. On June 30, 1935, General Motors' liquid assets were US$340,667,000. On June 30 of last year, it was US$299,838,000.</p>
<p>Serving Packard for Twenty-Five Years - The Packard Motor Company in the United States gives a gold pin as a souvenir to those who have continuously served at the factory for twenty-five years. Recently, another twenty-nine people at the company were qualified to wear the golden pin on their lapels because of their long years of service. These twenty-nine people included President Alvin Macauley. They all completed this long period of service on January 1 of last year. On the day of his 25th anniversary of service to the company, Macauley congratulated the others who had also completed 25 years of service and personally awarded each of them a long-awaited 25-year service commemorative pin. In addition to everyone congratulating each other, other automobile company officials and industry leaders celebrated Macauley's achievement. According to Packard Company's historical records, there are a total of 236 employees who have worked continuously for 25 years. There are 528 people who have worked continuously for 20 years. Employees who have served at the factory for more than five years account for approximately 44% of the total number of employees.</p>
<p>Como Truck Experienced Vicissitudes - In order to achieve excellence in manufacturing and to adapt to the special needs of various regions, the Como factory often sends specialists to investigate and study in various regions. Then, the results of the investigation are used to manufacture suitable automobiles. Therefore, the cargo trucks they sell in Patagonia, New Zealand, and Siberia are slightly different in manufacturing. During the Great War, the British military requisitioned various cargo trucks in the country for military use, stopping transportation outside. Later, the British army obtained a German cargo truck on the Western Front. They discovered that it was a Como brand and immediately investigated it. It turned out that the truck was sold by the Rodong factory to the Russian military in 1912. It was seized by the Germans in East Prussia and used within France. After a certain period of time, it returned to the hands of the British and was used to attack their enemies. This Como truck can be said to have experienced vicissitudes. And its durability cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>DRIVING NOTES ON THE SHANGHAI-GUANGDONG HIGHWAY</h3>
<p>There is a gentleman from Fujian, Ni Tuosheng, who recently accompanied two friends on a long-distance trip in his own Y-type small Ford car to investigate the actual development of the highway along the way. First, they departed from Shanghai and reached Hangzhou via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Then, from Hangzhou, they went via Yushan, Nanchang, Changsha, Hengshan, Ganzhou, Dayu, Nanxiong to Shaoguan, then turned to Shantou and arrived in Guangzhou. The journey from Shanghai to Shaoguan was 1,023 miles. From Shaoguan via Shantou to Guangzhou, it was 756 miles. The two totaled 1,779 miles. The travel time was 57 hours for the Shanghai to Shaoguan section. The Shaoguan via Shantou to Guangzhou section was 65 hours. A total of 122 hours. The latter section was shorter, but it took longer than the previous section. This is because it is rugged and difficult to travel between Shantou and Guangzhou, and it is necessary to detour. A total of 106 gallons of gasoline were used on this trip. Except for the round trip between Nanchang and Changsha, and the extra consumption due to many stops along the way, the average was about 24 miles per gallon. According to Mr. Ni, the roads traveled on this trip were all recently built. The highways in Hunan are scientifically based everywhere, neat, solid, and the best in all provinces. Even compared to Europe and the United States, there is not much difference. It is heard that Mr. Ni plans to travel to Guizhou after the autumn cools down. Although our country has been working hard to build highways recently, there are still not many people who drive long distances. Mr. Ni's perseverance is admirable. Another noteworthy thing is that before departure, Mr. Ni had the small Ford car, which was to be used for this long-distance trip, inspected and repaired by the repairman. He did not initially tell them the purpose of the trip. The repairmen only followed the procedures and repaired it once. When they arrived in Guangzhou safely, there were no mechanical problems. Those who heard this were surprised. Therefore, Mr. Ni is very satisfied with the durability and stability of Ford cars. The thoughtful and tireless service of Ford dealerships everywhere is also noteworthy.</p>
