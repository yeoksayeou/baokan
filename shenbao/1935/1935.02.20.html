<p>時評</p>
<h3>奬勵銀入口與加緊國貨運動</h3>
<p>自美國厲行購銀政策之後。我國白銀源流出。以致造成金融枯竭工商交困之象。唯自去年十月十五日財部毅然實行徵收銀出口税而後。白銀流出。漸見減少。然以已往之流出過多。市面仍感周轉不靈之苦。以故奬勵銀入口之需要。亦遂倍形迫切。今財部又應國内工商界之請求。訂定辦法。使國外之銀得以自由輸入。則此後國　存銀之保有額。自必因此而多得一重保障心。</p>
<p>然以關税方　法調節白銀之出入。究爲一時救急之辦法。而非治本之道。我國國際貿易。年年入超。故於國際收支上每處於逆調地位。往者以有華僑之匯欵。東北之出超。相爲抵補。以是尚無現銀輸出之必要。唯自九一八後。情勢逈異。東北既非我有。而華僑匯欵。近年亦復大减。則此種國際貿易上之入超差額。自須以現銀支付。故去年白銀之流出。一方雖爲美國提高銀價之結果。他方未始非受國際貿易入超之影響。若此種入超現象一日不改善。同時又無其他之抵補。相與挹注。則爲支付國際貿易之差額計。白銀終將流出也。故於今而言治本之道。必由制止貿易之入超始。</p>
<p>海通以來。我國之手工業。漸歸淘汰。國民日用所需。幾皆仰給於舶來品。對外貿易。僅有原料與農産品。以量多價賤之原料品。交換質精價昂之製成品。則其結果自必爲入超無疑。我國自有國際貿易以來。所以年年入超者。其故即在於是。而補救之方。自非由發展民族工業入手不可。發展民族工業之道。端在厲行保護關税。此爲當今經濟學者所公認。我我國關税。今日雖已自主。顧欲厲行保護關税。必將引起外交上之糾紛。我國民族工業之所以難於發展。此其一大原因。而貿易統制之所以不易實施。其實亦即在此種事實上之困難耳。</p>
<p>故於今日之國際環境下。而求我國民族工業之發展。仍唯有一途可走。即國貨運動是也。我國國貨運動。年來經各方提倡。氣象漸新。如往日商人每以舶來品炫耀顧客者。今則多以國貨相標榜。風氣之轉。於此可見一斑。然欲取外貨而代之。似尚須有極大之努力。一則愛國心之喚起。尚須爲繼續不輟之運動。二則國貨之眞僞。必須設法辨明。蓋今日市塲。舶來品之冒充國貨者。觸目皆是。孰爲國貨。孰爲舶來。顧客方面十九不能辨别。此種以僞亂眞之現象。若不及早糾正。必爲國貨運動前途之大害。我人以爲國貨廠商對於此點。似應加以注意。若能以種種方法培養民衆對於國貨之辨别力。則於國貨之推廣。裨益必多。總之。發展今日之民族工業。求之於保護關税與貿易統制。暫時恐皆難成事實。目下我人所可爲者。惟在可能之範圍以内。推廣國貨。使國貨日益推廣。則白銀流出自可漸减其分量。而金融枯竭。工商凋敝之痛苦。亦得因而减少矣。</p>

<h3>美金條文案宣判</h3>
<p>政府方面完全勝訴</p>
<p>私人債劵不適用金條文</p>
<p>國家債務仍得償付現金</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國最高法院頃宣佈關於憲法金條文之判决文、裁定對於私人所訂債務契約、憲法中之金條文應作爲廢止、但國家債務及偕欵、則仍應由政府以黄金償還云、當宣讀判决文時、法院聽衆異常擁擠、政府代表高級官員及國會議員、均親行到塲、但法院四處門户則均緊閉、蓋避免外間盼待消息之羣衆蜂擁而入也、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國最高法院對於「付金條文」之測騐案、今日業已宣判、判詞頗贊助「新政」之弊制政策、法院對於國會議决廢止一切私人債劵之付金條文、完全贊成、對於政府債劵雖稱國會越權、惟否認人民有控訴政府之權、財部於收還金庫劵時、人民亦不得因現在通貨價值减低、而要求政府每元付還一元六角九分、法院因所涉過鉅、今日宣判之時一反向例、竟先讀主文、然後陳述理由、法院以爲關於政府債劵各案、美國「賠償法院」實無權處理、國會議决廢止付金條文、雖屬越權、惟欲求改變、亦必須依法進行、非「賠償法院」所可處理云、是故最高法院此項判决、已使執有政府債劵及金庫劵者、無法再行起訴、財部官員聞此消息、咸稱此係政府之完全勝利、而法院方面、既否認人民有控訴政府之權、即亦無須判明執有政府債劵者、是否應得現行通貨一元六角九分以抵舊弊一元、及國會議决廢止付金條文、是否合法各點、最高法院此次判詞、有數點非常奇突、故宣讀之時、院中情形殊爲紛亂、法官九人之意見、爲五對四、主席法官休士等爲多數意見、反對方面則爲雷諾爾等、今日清晨法院門前即非常擁擠、以待判决書之宣讀云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>判詞要旨包含兩點</p>
<p>［華盛頓］最高法院關於金條文案之判詞、現已發表、雖表面上不利於政府債劵、但實際上可視爲政府之完全勝利、判詞大旨、爲（一）承認政府所稱金條文不適用於私人債劵一點之説、（二）否認政府所稱政府債劵無庸以黄金償付之説、換言之、最高法院擁護政府取消私人債劵金條文之權、但判定國會决議案規定政府債務可用美元償還者爲無效、最高法院以爲此種債劵、必須以黄金或以現有貶值之通貨的同等價值償還之、但同時最高法院對於執有以前金劵者、否認其有向「賠償法院」請求救濟之權、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>執劵人無法再起訴</p>
<p>查執有以前之金劵者、近曾請求金劵美元應以現有貶值通貨一元六角九分償付之、故最高法院此種裁判、將使執有債劵者不能依照舊有金標凖收回其資、蓋最高法院雖判定政府須以黄金或以貶值通貨同等價值償付債劵、然此效力已完全消滅、因最高法院不許人有關於此事請求救濟之權也、故政府雖在技術上與法理上失敗、然在事實上固佔勝利也、</p>
<p>賠償損失之門封閉</p>
<p>以政府債劵判詞之效力言、凡執有一千元金劵者、政府對之、必須償以依照今日價值之美元一千六百九十元、但法院同時又判定執劵人不能控訴政府要求賠償、故賠償損失之門、業已封閉、　　擁護政府貨幣政策</p>
<p>法院又判定政府减低美元價值之行爲爲不合憲法、但同時聲稱、執劵者並未因此行爲而遭損失、蓋政府此舉、不過實施國會之權、以調節國家貨幣耳、據此判决、照數償還、無須加給、以實際言、最高法院之判詞、擁護國會處置貨幣事件之權、並承認法院在裁判契約案件時必須顧及現有經濟狀况、</p>
<p>法官九人贊成佔五</p>
<p>上述判詞、係多數法官之意見、蓋最高法院法官九人、而贊成之者五人、故佔多數、而少數法官舉麥克萊諾斯爲代表、陳述其意見、對於多數法官加以嚴苛之批評、謂憲法蕩然無存、多數法官一面聲明國會未有抵賴金劵債務之權、一面又判定執劵者不得收受黄金、必須收受價值六角合法通貨、以代替政府前所依允照付之金元、</p>
<p>貶值獲利悉存國庫</p>
<p>據此判詞、國會無權否認其債劵中黄金之義務、但竟可無須以貶值通貨補繳應付之金價、須知政府貶低幣值、獲利二十八萬萬元之多、此數悉存於國庫云、</p>
<p>良心裁判勇氣可佩</p>
<p>［紐約］紐約時報稱、金條文案判詞雖未爲大多數法官、所贊成、但此可視爲有獨立性質與公共精神者之良心上裁判、其責備政府未履行其義務之語、尤可見其勇氣、故此判詞之實際上影響、雖未必遠大、但在道德上、其影響殊非細微、此後秉政權者將瞭然最高法院、之不爲其後援、而不敢對於國家榮譽、輕易有所舉動也、美國人民初聞政府有意抵賴其尊嚴債務引爲奇恥、今法院已有以解此恥辱、而宣佈此種舉動爲不道德、且不合法矣云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>政府當局大爲欣慰</p>

<h3>魯省金礦調查</h3>
<p>濟南通信、本省礦産素富、曩以提倡乏人、以致利棄於地、殊覺可惜、近自實業廳歸併建設廳以來、當局對於金礦、頗有開採之擬議、惟以礦區尚待查勘、故未見諸實施、最近建設廳委任礦冶專家常濟安負、查勘之責、（常氏幼即留學美國、研究礦冶之學、得有碩士學位、並於課餘赴美之西部、著名金廠内實際練習、經騐頗富、）常氏以兩個月工夫、先赴魯西、繼往膠東、作實地之履勘、業已事竣返省、據云已勘得可開之金礦數處、兹錄其調查報告概况如次、</p>
<p>（一）山東各縣金礦之生成與其藴藏量　山東各縣金礦、分爲山金·砂金·兩種、砂金礦之在膠東者、應以棲霞之大唐山爲最要、其冲積礦床、曾被造山作用、抬至高處、但其生成、仍與其他砂金礦床之存留於河底者無異、祇以歷經採掘、富砂殘餘無幾、故無大望、山金礦除汶上曇山、以礦脈不規則、毫無價值外、計有牟平之金牛山、鬼道山、平度之雙山·蝎子山、招遠之玲瓏山·清水窪等處、均爲裂縫礦床、與美國家特拿者卜堤市之銅礦、及加利福尼亞亘大州之金礦、兩處所見、大致相同、頗有延深富化之望、計其藴藏量、即在地面下三百尺之内者、以每噸礦砂最低之成分平均計算、則招遠牟平平度三縣境内統共藴金、仍不下於二千工百九十三萬七千五百兩、</p>
<p>（二）山東各縣金礦現有之作業　山東各縣金礦現有之作業、類皆故步自封、拾掇前人之剩砂、究其所以未能進展之故、（一）兩旁石質堅硬、鑿石笨法、僅得日進三寸、因之採礦工作、未能延深届遠、（二）礦乏吸水之設備、所有平坑道以下之水、概不設法提冶、（三）礦砂之含硫化物過多者、縱然内含金質是鉅亦視爲不可製之砂、故關於冶金之技術、亦非另覓新途徑不可、</p>
<p>（三）整理山東各縣金礦之入手辦法　查平度雙山金礦、以欠官欵被封、牟平金牛山金礦、曾經收回自辦、各有專案、招遠清水窪等處、屢起糾紛、其附近除商家李愷已領之礦區、約計五方里外、餘者概未設權、所剩面積頗大、應先就此三處設權、擇其易者着手試探、次第興辦礦冶、以樹新式模範、</p>
<p>（四）整理山東各縣金礦之將來希望　山東産金將來之地位、究應若何揣測、當爲吾人所急欲聞知者、查世界每年金産額、約共重七百餘噸、南非洲恰佔半數、其他年産額在十噸以上者、尚有美·加·蘇·墨·英·日·澳·等數國、而我國不與焉、但我國十年前之産額、確亦曾達此數、惟不久即行跌下、山東古時産金頗多、其産額已無可考、五十年前、亦曾一度得達年産金十萬兩左右、近一二十年、則異常退落、每年産額遞减數百兩、現年産量銷漲、約計不過三千餘兩、而近鄰之朝鮮、其面積礦産均與本省無區别、其金産額爲八噸半、折合二十餘萬兩、在世界産金國中、業經取得相當地位、魯省若急起直追、資本與技術之合作、雙方並進、以本省天賦之優、藴藏之富、金産决不致落後、如能乘機爲有效之進展、不特腹地寶藏、得以開發、即於中國礦業史上、將開一新紀元也、</p>

<p>主席吳醒亞報告云、自蔣委員長倡導新生活運動於南昌以後、全國聞風興起、相率實行、一年以來、已獲着驚人的成績、我萎靡不振的民族、始獲得一新的生機、而充分顯出發奮圖强的先兆、這在新運週年紀念的今天回溯起來、是深深地值得吾人的慶幸、但是吾人稍一回想、怎樣才是標凖的新生活、吾人曾否一一做到、自有賴於吾人賡續之努力、在過去一年當中、能實行新生活的人、固不在少數、但也還有許多國民對新運尚多徘徊觀望畏難苟安、以爲新生活運動、是很特殊很專門一個運動、這眞是弄錯了、蔣先生説過、「現在的新生活運動、乃是要使一般國民個個人所能知·所能行·的日常生活、要以禮義廉恥爲基礎、而照着我們所提倡的、」「整齊」「清潔」「簡單」「樸素」「迅速」「確實」這六項運動爲標準、隨時隨地來身體力行、這是很平常很簡單習常生活運動、並無任何範圍時間和地域的限制、更無社會階級的區别、」由此可以知道、所謂新生活、即吾人日常生活習慣、吾人祗要朝夕留意於自家的日常生活、那些是舊的不良的習慣、改掉牠、那些是新的好的、就是蔣先生所昭示的幾個準則、隨時隨地實行、使漸漸成爲習慣、這就算成功、我們爲什麽要如此呢、蔣先生也説過、今後要想復興我們的國家和民族、一定要根本上從提高國民的智識道德這一點來做、我們要提高國民的智識道德、要從什麽地方着手呢、這就要講到一般國民的基本生活、即所謂衣食住行、一個人或一國國民的精神·思想·智識·道德·統統可以從基本生活表現出來、我們中國之所以始終被人侵略壓迫、一言以蔽之、就是我們一般國民的基本生活、不能合乎禮義廉恥、新生活運動、是使我們全國國民的生活都能合乎禮義廉恥、適於現代的生存、表現出我們全體國民高尚的智識與道德、所以我們祇要實行新生活運動、就算奠定復興民族的基礎、現在新生活運動、已及一年、國民智識程度如此之低、欲求普遍風行、自屬難能可貴、因此、這個推行責任、不能不歸到智識份子及各界領袖的身上、蔣先生在贛行營紀念週席上説過、改進社會、復興國家和民族的責任、在事實上、絶不能希望全體國民都能盡到、完全要靠我們一般有智識的做國家民衆領袖的人、能够將這個責任負起來、以身作則的切實去幹、才可以推動全國國民共同覺悟奮發、恊力、來幹、」所以一年以來、各地智識份子與民衆領袖、相率組織分會、倡導施行、上海的分會、在這種意義上也産生了、上海一埠、一方面爲全國經濟文化的重心、一言一行、莫不足以掀動全國的視聽、反之、一方面又爲華洋雜處的繁雜區域、一舉一動、又多格於事實而驟難實現、所以上海的新運、是最重要、但又較困難的工作、一年以來賴各界領袖及各同志之努力、大致成績亦不十分落後、深爲慶幸、兹趁新運週年紀念的今天、謹將新運意義及領袖昭示吾人的各要點、再爲贅述一二、以誌不忘、而表示檢閲之意、願自勉並以勉諸同志、</p>
<p>市長訓辭</p>
<p>主席吳醒亞報告後、旋由指導員吳鐵城市長訓詞云、主席、各位先生、各位同志、今天是新生活運動一週年紀念日、也就是紀念去年二月十九蔣委員長在南昌發表新生活運動的理論、和領導全國實行新生活運動的新紀元的一天、蔣委員長在革命過程中、發見了一個全國普遍的毛病、這個毛病、不但足以妨害國民革命的進展、抑且可以使我們的國家滅亡、我們的民族消滅、所以本革命先革心、興國先興民的宗旨、在南昌倡導新生活運動、要全國人民、一致從事於生活的革命、這不能不説是民族復興運動的一大進步、各位同志、我們用我們靈敏的知覺、本豐富的經騐、來檢討許多過去的事物、就可以得到一個民族生存的眞諦、不論一個國家的興亡、一個民族的盛衰、小而至於一個家庭的興衰、一個人的事業的成功或失敗、决不是偶然的事、都是有一定的道理在裏面的、如果我們的生活、如火車一樣的依着軌道而行、則必興盛、必成功、反之、如果我們的生活、不能上軌道、則無有不衰亡失敗、中國固有道德、禮義廉恥、就是我們日常生活常軌、况且一時代是有一時代的生活與精神、在現今我們這時代裏、自有一種與前不同的生活與精神、現今這一時代的生活、是要「合理化」、合理化的生活、一定要能上軌道、整個民族的生活、都能合理化、上軌道、這個民族方能復興起來、而成爲一個有團給性的新時代民族、所以蔣委員長指示我們實行新生活運動、先要從個人來做起、再推及整個民族、又指示我們從「整齊清潔簡單樸素」做起、而達到我們生活的軍事化生産化和藝術化、並定「禮義廉恥」、我們中華民族固有的道德、爲我們每個人處世做人的最高原則、使這種新的精神、深入於我們日常生活的衣食住行之中、蔚爲一種風氣、成爲一種習慣、這種風氣和習慣、形成了、以後新生活運動、就能永垂久遠、成爲一種改造民族、推動民族、復興民族、的力量、新生活運動、在上海自開始工佈、到現在、也已將近有一年之久、我們上海的同志和上海市民、在這一年之中、究竟對新生活運動的意義、認識清楚了没有、需要新生活迫切不迫切、而在迫切需要新生活的時候、我們上海實行新生活運動的人、又奉行至如何程度、這是我們上海同志和市民·在今天新生活運動週年紀念的時候、所應該自己切切實實加以檢查的、我們檢查以往、　是激勵來兹、新生活運動、不是一朝一夕之事、乃係百年千秋的國是、必須先要由全國各地方愛民族、救國家、而信仰新生活運動的人、來身體力行、以身作則、并且普及到大衆裏去、才能成功、所以我們在今天檢查我們一年來的工作之後、還要加緊努力、來推行新生活運動、務使新生活運動在上海能够日漸普及、能够漸告成功、如果一個都市裏的新生活運動、能普及能成功、那麽、這一個都市、也就能隨之而繁榮起來、而居住在這都市裏的人、不論農工商學各種事業的人、因爲生活的合理化、他的事業也定能成功、如此全國一致努力、推行新生活運動的結果、我們中華民族的生命、自然得有復興之希望、這是我們今天在紀念之餘、所應共同策勵的、</p>

<p>中華海員特别黨部、昨晨九時、在該黨部大禮堂、舉行新生活運動週年紀念大會、到會者全體委員職員、及上海區黨部區分部委員、航海聯義會　事部領江都飯業部小輪部、航海舵工木匠互助會、中國航海駕駛員聯合會、南均安聯　善會、焱盈總社·焱盈南社·中國船舶無綫電員公益會、中華海員票務互助會、等數十團體、代表共三百餘人、會塲遍懸旗幟花彩·五光十色·燦爛奪目、由主席團楊虎·王永盛·陳頌平·等三人、領導行禮如儀後、秘書陳領平報告、首先闡述新生活之意義、曰禮義廉恥、爲新生活之精神的信條簡單樸素、整齊清潔、爲新生活之形式的信條、吾人如能本此信條、行於自身、則必爲一健全新民、行於社會、則不難造成一新興國家、繼而復痛論國人對於生活觀念之錯誤、如古代王猛捫蝨而談國事、王荆公科首跣足、三年不浴、時人反認爲風流、誠足貽笑大方、最後勗勉吾海員同志、應洗心革面、熱心努力、於新生活之實踐、一掃過去因循泄沓污穢齷齪之風云云、同時由該會宣傳科散發新生活運動小册、至十一時散會、</p>
<h3>市保安處及特别黨部定期舉行清潔運動</h3>
<p>指定掃除街道</p>
<p>委派檢查人員</p>
<p>本市保安處及該處特黨部、爲推進新生活運動、並引起市民注意起見、定於本月二十一日起、舉行清潔運動、組織洒掃担架宣傳各隊出動工作、該處部以距期已促、故籌備工作更形緊張、爰記其詳情如次、</p>
<p>開談話會　該處部於昨日下午一時、召集各級黨部·及各團隊代表、在黨部禮堂、開談話會、到各代表六十餘人、商討進行方法、頗爲詳盡、直至四時餘始散、</p>
<p>决定路綫　該處各團隊掃除路綫、亦經指定、聞爲市政府路·小木橋路·斜土路·南車站·肇嘉路·寶山路·鴻興路·大統路·恒豐路·北車站·中山路·共和路·謹記路·龍華·譚子灣·談家橋·三角地·徐家匯路·周家橋·西光復路·高昌廟·彭浦路、及市外南翔、瀏河·白龍港等處、雖配佈不無散漫、但普遍則可如期云、</p>
<p>委檢查員　該處部爲求工作之實效起見、特委派多數檢查人員從事考核、評判優劣、昨計委出程公俠·李無聲·方正清·張啓驤·王成志·梅雪岩·劉萬鈞·王寄一·陳卓民·文華宙·宓熙·鄒玉楨·王惟明·齊學啓·陸毓麟·童葆暉·吳傳薪·周天健·等爲檢查員、並指定程公俠·王成志·陳卓民·齊學啓·爲檢查長分區檢查、以資督促、又聞大掃除之時間、已定二十一日上午九時起十一時半止、届時並請衛生局、派遣洒水車、恊助工作云、</p>
<h3>美金條文判决後遠東無甚關係</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、據接近國民政府之負責方面聲稱、美國最高法院對金條文之判决、與遠束無甚關係、某某數國政府當然爲之寛慰、因彼等今可以現行减值之美元償付欠美之債欵、而不致再發生用原值之美元償付之爭議、至於中國、對美之債務、比較甚微、故向未發生上述之爭議、但今既有此判决、亦可銷滅發生之可能性、據紐約消息、今晨外國匯價一律飛漲、但中國匯價、未受若何影響、現信此項判决、與本埠商業或中國金融市阅無根本上之關係、判决消息傳至上海時、僅距紐約證券交易所收盤前數分鐘、故本埠投機家殊難有所活動、昨晚經紀人之電話雖異常忙碌、而因金條文判詞、尚難捉摸、故交易並不見旺、所成交易、多屬獲利了結者也、</p>
<h3>外匯平市委員會向倫敦購銀運滬</h3>
<p>首批三百萬元已裝輪運滬</p>
<p>外商籌議運現銀投資我國</p>

<p>外商籌議投資我國</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨向外商銀行界探悉、自我國加征銀出口税、及平衡税後、在華之外國商人、均不願將以貨易得之銀、投資我國市塲、因太不合算、無利可圖、今政府實行奬勵銀進口後、外商已籌議運銀回華、投資我國市塲、因將來再運出口時、可免征出口税及平衡税、且以有利可圖、至於外商銀行運銀回滬、事實上暫時並不需要、因滬上外商銀行、對於庫存、早已有凖備、今雖不見十分充足、但可無慮、將來視需要否、隨時决定云、</p>
<p>平會向英購銀運滬</p>
<p>外匯平市委員會、爲安定市面、委託中國交通香港分行、購銀運滬、先後已到二百九十三萬六千五百元、原定計劃二千萬元、今因香港市塲銀價提高、故改向英國倫敦市塲購買、新聲社記者、昨晤該會委員張佩紳氏、據談、該會向倫敦購銀、確係事實、首批三百萬元、已裝輪駛滬、此後是否續向倫敦購買、須視市面需要否、隨時决定云云、聞是項現銀、約在下月中、可抵滬埠、</p>
<p>平衡税率每日公佈</p>
<p>外匯平市委員會、每日上午十時、公佈之平衡税率、與奬勵銀進口辦法、並不相背、外傳將取消之説、絶對不確、昨日公佈税率、每百分之五·七五、至於中央銀行公佈之電匯賣價拆合、昨日倫敦每國幣一元爲一先令五便士七五、紐約每國幣一百元爲三十六美金一八七五、巴黎每國幣一百元、爲五百三十六法郎、柏林每國幣一百元爲八十九馬克、</p>
<p>港銀五十萬昨抵滬</p>
<p>報載外匯平市委員會、購港銀五十萬元、裝大來公司傑克遜總統輪、於昨日抵滬、新聲社記者昨日往訪該會委員席德懋張佩紳、據説該會未有所聞、但據另一方面探悉、恐係外商的運、</p>

<h3>海貞輪進口撞壞海祥輪</h3>
<p>因潮水關係肇禍</p>
<p>打倒車無濟於事</p>
<p>招商局新輪海貞號、此次自汕港粵返滬、在進口時將在金利源碼頭之海祥輪撞壞、損失情形、尚不甚重大、海祥且可照常開出、兹將經過狀况、報告如下、</p>
<p>掉頭肇事</p>
<p>海貞輪在十七日上午十時半進口後、即開往南市十六舖金利源碼頭停沿、船到新江天碼頭前江面、海貞船主胡照元便將船身掉頭、此時海貞輪於轉身時、能穿過甯紹與江天兩河筒、胡照元在駕駛上頗有能力、詎意船身掉正、因潮水關係、海貞船身急向前進、其時第三號碼頭上、停有海祥輪正在裝貨、胡照元見海貞將與海祥撞碰而且來勢極重、胡船主立即停車、仍不能止船前進、乃急命一面打倒車、一面連抛兩錨、依然未將船止、但前進勢已大减、故雖撞入海祥、損害得以减輕、</p>
<p>兩輪均損</p>
<p>海祥輪用三條鐵絲纜帶住在碼頭上、正在載貨、故無法避讓、苟海貞不打倒車、下兩錨、海祥輪必爲海貞撞毁半艘、當時海貞船頭撞進海祥船尾時、海貞之倒車力已發出、故海祥之後船尾上台甲欄杆鐵板、盡被海貞撞毁、帶岸之三條鐵絲纜、亦盡被撞斷、至海貞輪之船頭鋼板、亦遭撞凹、出事之後、經兩輪船主各將詳細情形、呈報總局、請求派員到輪勘騐、總船主沈際雲及船舶科主任、均親往騐視、</p>
<p>報請騐勘</p>
<p>昨日局内已將兩船撞碰之情形、根據胡熙元與雷克斯兩船主之報告、轉告承保兩輪平安險之保險公司查照、海祥由肇泰等所保、海貞係揚子保險公司承保、昨日華商保險行派員檢騐之下、以海祥由海貞撞碰、其責任應歸海貞所負、海祥輪之一切損失、統歸海貞之保險行負担、總計此次兩船撞碰、其損失數目、雖未能詳知、大致在四五千元左右、</p>
<p>照常開行　此事發生後、海貞船主胡熙元曾於昨日向總局憤而提出辭職、謂照其所發之倒車命令、或可不致肇禍、局内因海祥撞毁之處、幸在台甲之上、不妨航行、故仍令該輪照常開出、俟其下班返滬、再行修理、至於海貞輪撞損之船頭鋼板、昨經局内議定、亦可暫緩即修、故仍令依期出口、</p>

<p>兩艶妓遇人不淑亦被株連</p>
<p>贓洋三萬元已在港埠搜出</p>
<p>中國農工銀行行員華仲初、因用巧妙方法、竊取該行鈔洋四萬餘元、偕兩妓女搭輪遁至香港、被該行察覺、急報捕電港、將華攔獲、昨晨據華東社記者探悉、本市公共租界捕房、已派探將華押解來滬、後日可到、兩妓女亦被探連同遭縲絏、將於到滬後、受法律制裁、兹將各情分誌如下、</p>

<p>搜出贓洋</p>
<p>此次農工銀行被竊達四萬餘元之多、而華赴港之時、因時間忽促、僅將一部分贓欵預存他處、其餘盡置於身畔、及抵港埠、港警務處於碼頭搜查、即在華身畔搜出贓洋三萬元、盡係十元之新鈔幣、港警疑竇頓生、遂得破案、至尚有萬餘元、則現在尚未有下落、須待華返滬訊問後方知云、</p>
<p>經過詳情</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳藴素）</p>
<p>所謂戀愛，是男的戀女的臉蛋兒，女的愛男的花銀子。</p>
<p>「出洋留學，便是去鍍金。」假使這話是對的，那麽，留學生的本身凖是廢銅爛鐵。</p>
<p>女人是男子的玩物，男子是女人的奴隸。打開窗子説句亮話，兩性的結合，祇是互相用而已。（德宏）</p>
<p>我人從另一世界，到這一世界來，儘有許多東西學都學不會，教都教不上。可是吃喝嫖賭這四項，任你怎樣的愚笨，怎樣的不聰明，並不要自己去學習，也不要人家來指導，總會玩得頭頭是道。這還是父母遺留給我們的恩澤，還是社會給我們的餘惠？</p>
<h3>春燈憶語</h3>
<p>— 渺予</p>
<p>往歲春節，休沐之暇，里中少年，輒於元宵懸燈市櫛，相與射虎爲娱。邇時飄零海上，索居岑寂，已無復當時盍簪之樂矣。因憶舊時雋妙者數則，述之如右，亦鴻雪留痕之意也。</p>
<p>個中人多少年，故所著謎絶少經書中語，佳者如朱毛射姓「赫連」。葉底鴛鴦夢正圓射縣名「荷澤」。指頭兒告了消乏射成語「隔靴搔癢」。鳳凰棲射時人（去冠）「孫桐崗」。可人無恙射時人「何健」。易水别射韵四（去數）「寒江豪歌」。鮝射韵二（去數）「鹽魚」。减處徒刑射唐詩「罪從大辟皆除死」。燕窩射唐詩「烟銷日出不見人」。理絲桐射古美人（捲簾）「琴操」。吳門地仄射古美人「蘇小」等等，似尚渾脱也。</p>
<p>謎有重門格者，鈎心鬭角，煞費尋思。其時所懸，曾有二謎，一爲甘霖射韵二（去數）「宋江」。蓋以甘霖切及時雨，而聯想及宋江之諢號也。一爲行頭箱受潮射書名「金匱傷寒」。以金切「行頭也」。雖未見巧不可偕，然作者已下得一番苦功矣。又有白也君者，亦同輩中人，有人製私處潔净無毛一謎，射其大名。蓋以也扣女陰，從説文。是則謔而虐焉。</p>
<p>吾友征雁，嘗懸一謎曰「征失」，射藥名果名香烟牌名各一，（徐妃）實則皆爲「檳榔」也。詞意淺顯，本易應射，惟一經作者故佈疑陣，人多束手，及揭示，有賞其心思繚曲者，實不知其脱胎古人「玉環」一謎而成耳。</p>
<p>有取市上商店牌號入謎者，如花射「華通」。中山精神不死射「孫長生」。白頭猶如少年人射「翁長春」。割據之局平而天下治射「合興」。本地風光，不過聊備一格耳。又有以柳下惠射「聖和」。龜頭印射「蔡信義」者，似覺稍勝一籌，然亦有此現成謎面，方得此妙手也。</p>
<p>六書之謎，頗不易工，如只是近黄昏射「醍」。荷笠帶殘殊射「茱」。從頭至尾兩相連，竟無一個旁人見射「坐」。人間草木射「茶」。半間湘簾日當午射「篤」。等等，或亦有幾分可取耳。</p>
<p>有友醫也，所製謎多隱藥籠中物。蓋亦不忘其本來面目也。記其稍佳者，如艾綠榴紅射「半夏」。千金揮盡不復歸射「浪蕩子」。鬢如絲射「斑毛」。頻頻仰首射「連翹」。等，或不致有牽强附會之譏也。</p>
<h3>爆仗顛倒放</h3>
<h3>我的回憶</h3>
<p>— 金淑雲</p>
<p>帶着一顆幼稚的心，還没有經過這大社會冶罏裏的反覆鍜鍊過約稚弱的身子，和思想，現在，我居是自問還相當很勇敢的，走到這萬花撩亂的大社會中，來受這社會中驚濤駭浪的洗禮了。</p>
<p>回憶着我的過去，我是不能不有相當地感嘅的，不，這不能説是感嘅，而應該説是，這是對於我過去的一種檢閲。</p>
<p>記得是在我的六七歲左右罷，那時我已很倖運的進得學堂了。我而究竟因爲我不知道進得學堂還是一種幸福—有多少孩子，他們都進不得學堂—所以我那時雖已走到學堂裏，但平時對於課程，我是不大用功去讀的。因此，我的學期成績不及格。我受到了多少恥辱。結果，我很努力的上進，不再一味貪玩，把功課完全忘掉了。學年考試，我居然名列第一。這可謂是社會對我第一次的教訓。</p>
<p>經過六年小學，隨後，很倖運的又到上海，進入中學。但不幸的事體隨即來了。我母親生病，家中無人服侍，不得已，我只有告了很久的假，來服侍我母親的病。隨後，母親病好了，可是，我的學業也荒了。不久，我就從家庭中滚出來，滚到這社會中，來做了這大社會冶罏中的一粒微塵。</p>
<p>回憶着我的過去，雖然是十分平平淡淡的，然而，我也相當帶了多少鬭爭的熱情。今後，我將再加强這鬭爭的熱情和毅勇，去爭取我光明的前程！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咜未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>然而他對於志前的話，表示着苦惱，那是可想而知的。這完了，高應長表示出這種態度來，顯然是通不過。他心裏想到這完了，而同時這兩隻手也不免做出那完了的樣子來，在屁股上重重的拍了一下，就是兩隻脚，也微微的一跳。殊不知就是這樣的一跳，有些頭重脚輕。恰好那站的所在，地面上有一層浮薄的青苔。於是呼溜一下，作了個溜冰的勢子，人向下一坐，屁股哄咯的作嚮，坐在了地上，雖然不感到痛，可是週身的骨節，都是這樣的震得麻酥過去了，坐在地面上，有好幾分鐘説不出話來。還是在旁遇小屋子裏的茶房，被聲音驚醒。走了出來，忙問是什麽嚮。介夫不便答應，悄悄的扶了墻站起來，走到廊檐下，一手撑了腰才向茶房道：是我到窗子外看看，裏面有我的崽友没有？不想那地面太滑，摔了一跤。説着自己向屋子裏走去，胡氏道：喲！張老爺，你身上怎麽沾了這一身的泥哩？介夫扯起長衣的後擺一看，可不是沽着半截呢嗎？紅了臉道：那還不都是爲了你們的事？他正想繼續的説下去，把這樣故告訴他。可是送信的那個茶房：已經來回信了。向介夫道：程先生回到自己屋子裏去了，呌這位大嫂子，帶了他的姑娘去。程先生説：這席上没有高廳長。介夫這才知道自己是白沾了這一身泥，那個穿西服的，並不是高廳長。哦了一聲，還不曾説得别的。然而這兩位等信息的母女，正覺得坐立不安。既然看了程先生的話，那還等什麽？胡氏首先就扶了桌子站起來。而且月英比他他更急，已經走到房門口了。（一三七）</p>

<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>關於吃的禁忌</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>我們中國一切事件都趕不上别國，獨有「吃」這一門，毫不誇張，要算我國最是强勝，—品類之多，方法之精，我國人胃口好，無出其右，中國菜館遍設各國，大受歡迎，自有眞價，實非僥倖。但看我們的萬世師表孔老夫子，也對於吃定下許多取締的規條—當然就是十分研究的表示—什麽「色惡不食，臭惡不食，割不正不食，」來了一大套。我國的習俗，本來禁忌最多，（這也是比别國强勝之點，應得補充一句，）對這人生大慾的吃，自難獨異：况有孔聖人的遺訓的影響在先，一發禁忌得不可收拾了！要知禁忌，本是大部份的取締，合上小部份的迷信釀成的。</p>
<p>我來講一點關於吃的禁忌，據我所知而一時思想所及的：照我國的地大忌多，各地風俗又異，實在一言難盡！</p>
<p>擊弄筷碗，最是大忌。不要説孩子們了，就是成人們，臨餐或許恰逢心緒無聊時，每不經意的有這種的動作：可是這個禁忌立刻會被想到，立刻會糾正的。有兩句通俗格言説：「敲碗駡天，敲筷罵地。」</p>
<p>「君子不吃翻魚。」這個戒條不知從何而起，也是大衆所願信守的。在事實上，若是整條的魚放在盆或碗裏，一定要從上面吃起，吃到下面那半條，這下面半條很不容易吃的。據我想，這句話裏一定有以訛傳訛之處，恐怕是「君子不吃返魚」，較有意義。筷頭上檢了一塊魚，取近眼前仔細一看，這塊不行，調換一塊罷，於是返還的手續要值行了：這個吃法未免利己心太重，而且吃相很是旁觀不雅，應該在禁忌之列了。</p>
<p>魚頭，有些地方是鴨頭，在商店的筵席上，對準一個夥計，這是店主對這夥計有不滿意處，暗申告誡，甚至暗示解雇的意思。所以平常不要有什麽表示的時候，席上若有一簋是魚或鴨，那魚頭或鴨頭一定對着主座安放的。這是寓意的辦法，避免賓主正面衝突，又留雇員的顔面，用意很好的。不過這個辦法成了習慣，會使全店的雇員對於筵席上菜碗裏的那顆頭很具戒心，視爲大忌了。</p>
<p>可説的還有許多，有便時再談；這裏暫告一個段落。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>論到戲臺，北京宫中的那一座也還平常；最特别的要算是頤和園裏的那一座了！它一共有三層，據説當初建的時候，那些樓板全是活絡的，可以上下移動，做得差不多和現在的升降幾一般的靈巧。當最上的一層上在演戲的時候，下面兩層爲看戲的人所瞧不見的台上，已暗暗在凖備着了；待到上層的戲演完，便立即把它吊上高頭去隱過了，第二層便在同時吊上來，所有的佈置已早就擺下，連最先出塲的戲子也已在台上站着了。這樣把舞台吊上吊下的結果，就省却了一番檢塲的工夫，前後兩齣戲儘可緊接的演出了。在那時候，如此巧妙的構造，眞可説是絶無僅有的新鮮巴戲，着實驚動了不少的人。而主持這件工程的設計人員中，第一個便是太后自己。可惜後來因爲不很安全的緣故，就停止使用了；但規模的寛暢，構造精美，還是非常的出色，遠非别處的戲臺可比</p>
<p>如今來到奉天，一切都很陳舊，再要有這樣精美的戲臺，自然是不可能的了！但爲不使太后感覺到過分的難看起見，臨時的張羅修飾，是不可省的：好在我們有的是太監，他們人數既多，辦事又能幹，這些零星夾雜的事情交託他們去辦，眞是無有辦不了的。果然隔不了多少時候，就有人來報道：「一切全齊備了，戲也扮好了，只等太后的懿旨，馬上就好開鑼。」這時候我就得把我所點的戲告訴太后了。方才我祇是差人去知照了那些唱戲的太監，並不曾先奏明太后。（二四八）</p>

<h3>國際教育電影恊會兩刊物</h3>
<p>羅馬國際教育電影恊會、爲國際聯合會、國際文化合作委員會之附屬機關、從事電影事業之國際合作、其在中國之分會、爲中國教育電影恊會、兹探其兩大刊物、近情分誌於下、</p>
<p>（一）「國際電影Intercime月刊、」國際教育電影恊會、已出版五年之國際教育電影月刊、有意英法德及西班牙五國文字、自本年一月起、刷新内容、更換名稱、充分表示電影問題之國際性、此乃國際重要團體之刊物、其中討論之問題、理論之辯駁、以及流行之見解、均用心審核後發表、</p>
<p>國際恊會、五年來經過一番預備工作、即研究教育電影之範圍、使屬於此中之問題、盡量確定而宣揚之、而在倫理及美學方面、用有系統之傳布、以使一般輿論贊助教育電影之推行、</p>
<p>今國際恊會已入於更切實之第二步工作、即由日常電影所發生之教育問題、以及用從教育立塲批評何者爲電影中最良出産、因此月刊中留相當地位、以分析方法、求達活動電影藝術之理想方面、</p>
<p>巴黎國際文傗合作恊會與羅馬國際教育電影恊會、數年之努力合作、在使得電影在教育文化及知識三方面之成功、今後對各種問題、作進一步討論、即反對之意見、亦充分發表、</p>
<p>該月刊爲推行國際恊會事業之刊物促文化界對電影教育生活之注意月刊、已邀得著作界權威爲之著論此輩作家深知電影之無限力量及其有無數危險之可能、故本刊内容寓教育於電影實極有精彩也、</p>
<p>（二）「電影大辭典」國際教育電影恊會、經過三年之辛苦、及長久工作、編輯電影藝術及實業大辭典一書、近已告竣、意文本即由國際出版界有名之Ulrico　Hoebli書局出版、其他各國文字、將從事準備、</p>
<p>因此爲空前創舉、經過困難頗多、既無先例可資倣尋、即國際通行之名詞、有時亦頗感缺乏、蓋各重要電影出産國家、自有一種慣用語、又因電影範圍廣大、銀幕所用之工業技術包含化學·電機·有聲攝·電聲學及力學等等、因此各部分均須加以研究不僅此也、如藝術史·製造·美學·工商業·劇臺技術建築學等等、亦須研究、</p>
<p>是書之内容、計有專門論文六百篇、次要文章三千篇、參考材料五千項科學技術、實業及美術界不下四百權威、曾參加工作如寫文章及編閲等事、是項大辭典約有四册、每册一千頁、圖表及相片約五千、此乃經過苦心及長久工作而成者、電影之各方面及可能性得討論無遺、預計春間付印、本年夏季出書、</p>
<p>大辭典誠爲國際教育電影恊會在電影出版方面極大之努力、將來繼續再版、再加上新材料使成爲電影工業極重要之基本參考書、其中新的發明關於電相及無綫電播影等、實由電影發達而來、故亦從理論及實際方面加以研究也、</p>

<h3>浙師範生畢業會考提前分三區舉行</h3>

<p>以調查天才兒童爲入手辦法</p>

<h3>潘公展演講上海的學校教育（二）</h3>
<p>我個人對於現在的教育、以爲不但上海、即是整個的中國、在今後幾年内、或是三年五年、或者七年八年、在這個階段中間、中央地方、朝野上下、大家應該用全副精神來灌主到「初等教育」方面、如果認爲這個主張是對的話、那末、由現在開始、我們要使「初等教育」進步得很多、進步得很快、如果財力不濟、不妨把「中等教育」與「高等教育」的擴張稍爲看輕一下、略爲慢一慢、不過、這並不是要「中等教育」與「高等教育」關門、而是要拿全力把「初等教育」先求充實、先求普遍、就我個人的意思、認爲我們應該對「初等教育」加以特别的努力、我爲什麽要有這種意思呢、我想、各位如果平心靜氣想一想、恐怕也能覺得我們應該來注意「初等教育、」</p>
<p>試拿中國和别國來比較、像英國、我們算他人口有四千五百萬、他們國内的小學生就有六百多萬、佔全人口百分之十四强、再説法國、我們算她人口有四千萬、他們國内的小學生就有四百多萬、佔全人口百分之十、德國、算她人口有六千萬、他們國内的小學生有九百萬、估全人口百分之十五、日本、算她人口有五千五百萬、他們國内的小學生也有九百萬、佔全人口百分之十六、美國、算她人口有一萬萬、他們國内有小學生二千萬、佔全人口百分之二十、這些國家裏面得進小學受「初等教育」的小學生、最少的比例佔到全人口百分之十、多的是佔到百分之二十、我們如以小的範圍、就用上海市來仿照各國情形比例一下看、上海有人口三百四十萬、小學生祇有十五萬八千人、不及全人口百分之五、如果與小學生數目最少的僅佔全人口百分之十的國家比、那末我們上海小學生也應佔全市人口百分之十、該有卅四萬小學生、假使同美國小學生數佔全人口百分之廿的國家比、那還要多一倍、上海就應該有六十八萬小學生、照我剛才所報告、我們上海公私立小學一齊在内、在二十二年度雖比二十一年度學生數加多、亦祇多到十五萬八千一百六十四人、就是算他有十六萬人、如與小學生佔全人口百分之十的法國比、我們上海應有三十四萬小學生、現今拿三十四萬比例數來比、還差十八萬人、這十八萬小孩子、雖應該進小學、而竟没有福氣没得機會進小學、倘與小學生佔全人口百分之二十的美國比、上海應有小學生六十八萬人、那更不得了、我們還相差五十二萬人、這五十二萬小學生要進學校而没有學校進、或者有人説、還有私塾學生、我們没有算在内、這一班私塾學生、我們也再算他有四萬人這四萬私塾學生與小學校學生加在一起、也不過二十萬人、以二十萬小學生數同三十四萬數目比、也還差十四萬人、</p>
<p>還有、我在這裏尚要報告一點補充的材料、就是現今全市的學齡兒童、什麽叫「學齡」照現行法令、凡一個兒童滿六歲至十二歲時候、叫「學齡兒童」、這時是他們應該進小學的年齡、我們在今年五月間曾經用過一個月工夫、做了一次調查、在此次調查、各學校教師與學生一致出去擔任調查工作、可惜的、有一點美中不足、就是租界並不合作、所以我們所調查的、祇是市政府所直接管轄的地方、計有學齡兒童十一萬、在這十一萬學齡兒童中間、已經就學的總共有五萬五千多人、差不多佔到已届學齡兒童數目中間的百分之五十左右、剛剛一半、還有一半已届學齡的兒童、没有進學校、以此類推、全市就學的兒童、最多也不過佔學齡兒童總數的一半、還有一半没有進小學、恰巧與十六七萬的數目相符、初等教育的需要既如此十分迫切、現在一年之間能够比較中等教育和高等教育進步的快、增加學生一萬五千人、自然是一件聊可自慰的事情、不過、仔細一想、也祇是比較的稍可自慰、而實在仍應自己慚悚、何以故、試想、就令上海全市人口絶不增加、學齡兒童也終於維持此數、則以每年增收小學生一萬五千人的比例推算、要使十六七萬的失學兒童入學、時間上還要繼續十一二年、經濟上每年也要多費三四百萬元、没有耐性的人一定會興「俟河之清」之嘆、所以説、縱然聊可自慰、也並非澈底的、</p>
<p>「初等教育」即「國民教育」、既重要如彼、而我國的初等教育基礎又脆薄如此、我們的國家要同人家競爭、怎樣競爭去、一個國家與别國競爭、完全要靠國民有知識、有能力、假使人家國民有知識和能力、我們國民没有知識和能力、人家國民懂科學、我們國民不行、人家進步、我們落伍、這怎能與人競爭呢、競爭完全要靠國力、其基礎完全在「教育」、假使這國家的教育、尤其是「初等教育」没有把基礎打好、要造高樓大厦、豈非夢想、我們的基本教育這樣空虚、如同造一所房子、墻脚根没有打好、要使牠載得多大重量、如何擔負得起、所以我説、我們要同各國競爭、别的競爭我姑且不説、先要看我們的「國民教育」同一般國家比較、是在水平綫上呢、還是在水平綫下、而事實上、我國現在的「國民教育」完全是在水平綫下、上海市的「初等教育」完全是在水平綫下、上海市的「初等教育」已不能同别國相較、若以全中國來講、那要格外痛心、我國號稱有四萬萬七千萬人口、即少説、也有四萬萬人口、這裏面究竟有多少小學生呢、照全國教育統計、據説有一千一百萬小學生、這一千一百萬小學生數目、我們聽着、好像很多、殊不知英法德日諸國他們祇幾千萬人口、所以他們有幾百萬到千萬的小學生已經很好、如果我國也足幾千萬乃至一萬萬的人口、那末有一千萬小學生、也算過得去、可是我們小學生數目是四萬萬七千萬人口中的一千一百萬、照百分比來算、祇古金人口中的百分之二點四、與他國相比、連人家的零頭都及不上、試問以這樣的一種情形、我們怎配談抵抗外侮、怎樣纔可去參加實力戰爭、要參加實力戰爭、不是一椿兒戲的事、先要估量自己力量如何、我們且不必説農村經濟破産、工商業凋敝、無力量與人戰爭、就以這基礎教育一點來説、也就使我們慚愧得置身無地了、</p>

<h3>男作家與女性描寫</h3>
<p>— 桂華芬</p>
<p>最近讀賣新聞的記者曾以很有趣味的「男性作家果然描寫着眞實的女性嗎？」一題質之代表現在日本文壇上的三方向的中條百合子，野上彌生子，長谷川時雨三女史。</p>
<p>她們的答覆，中條女史以爲男作家描寫女性時，當是對男子方便，有趣味，或者可以愛，可以輕蔑那樣的描寫着，反之，是很少被描寫着的。結果，有人把女人的肉體認爲鑑賞物而美醜交錯地描寫着，有人描寫着在悲哀方面發露的女性，對於現今女性的日常的現實的要求，大多數男作家都没有藝術底地表現。譬如説：現在一般青年女子，在青春的烈火燃燒之下，她們是熱烈地要追求年青的漢子。然而在生活問題的解决上，她們却甯願與經濟已能獨立，且能保障的中年男子結婚。像這樣的現象，有許多作家就看得莫明其妙而無所表現牠。這是作家還没有在現今複雜的社會生活的洪流裏去把握女性的緣故。也是由於作家的各種特殊的社會的制約性，使他不能那樣全面地去把握女性的緣故。因此記者問她那麽究竟怎樣的作家才能描寫眞實的女性時，她就説是對社會的觀察要有一把尖鋭的三稜鏡，牠能够在我們的生活的複雜的關係上，捉住歷史發展的契機，能够描寫男女的關係，如女性獨特問題的性質，對於從來被認爲對男性不便或不愉快的女性的感情或行動，都能够在社會發展的見透上去觀察，批判牠，祇有有這種能力的作家，才能表現女性種種現實的典型。</p>
<p>野上女史首先非難男作家把女性當爲性的對象去描寫，而同意中條女史對於男作家新女性的認不足的嘲笑。她説現今的作家常是看不見眞實的東西，因此寫出來的常是不倫不類的。她以爲社會生活若果更加廣汎，在政治上，經濟上，都男子能侵入女子的領域，女子能侵入男子的領域，那末男作家，就不難描寫女性，女作家，也不難描寫男性的世界了。</p>
<p>長谷川女史則以爲微妙的女性心理，雖爲大作家，也很難表現的。不過年青作家以表現與自己同輩的年青女人較有把握，反之，表現年老者，則每有不體貼不週到之虞。</p>
<p>她們對於男性作家關於女性的描寫所拿來作爲例證，而指出其缺點的創作，菊池寛的小説爲多。菊池寛初爲自然主義作家，現已完全隨落爲低級趣味的大衆文藝作家了。他的小説，千篇一律，都是描寫非常肉感的三四角戀愛。五四運動以後，他頗影響於我國文壇，完全模仿他的作家，現在都還健在。他們的作品，且曾迷惑過不少的青年，在五四運動後的十年間。即在現在，仍有一部分小姐姨太太，晝夜擁着他們的小説不放。把女性這樣去描寫創作傾向，最近一二年來，似乎已不大爲一般青年所歡迎了。於是更落後的創作傾向不知不覺地代替牠而起來。那就是——用章回小説的體裁去表現這樣的（或多少加以變更的）題材了。「啼笑姻緣」一類的小説就成爲年來最流行的作品。有人説這是一般小市民的低級趣味的讀物，讀者層以小市民爲多。但實在也似乎未必盡然。據我知道，大學生讀這樣小説的很多。我有幾位同鄉，在北平某大學讀書，當日本的砲火響在北平的近郊（一九三二年）時他們南歸，途經上海，住在大東旅館，但他們的皮箱裏每人有一部「啼笑姻緣」，到了大東又擺開來了。他們説「乘船搭車，牠比仁丹還好」。可知牠的影響，不只在小市民一隅。像這樣的作品，把社會現實，把女性，都没有眞實地描寫着。但是頗引以爲遺憾的是，正如中條野上二女史嘲笑日本男作家很少描寫着眞實的女性一樣地，我國的男作家也很少描寫着眞實的女性，五四時代，魯迅先生已描寫出農民的典型「阿Ｑ」，今日的典型女性，却還没有那一位作家像曹雪芹在「紅樓夢」裏彫刻出林黛玉以外的一個典型。</p>
<p>在複雜的社會生活上，在女性日常的現實要求上，在歷史發展的動機上，再現今日典型的新女性，我們的作家什麽時候才獻出這樣的作品來給我們的讀者呢？我們迫切地待望着。</p>
<h3>往事</h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>近來，每到黄昏，我總愛在小樓上眺望，看那歸巢的飛鳥，看那落霞，好像只有在這時候，才會感到輕微的榆快似的，也似乎只有在這時候才最適合重温一堆堆的舊夢似的。</p>
<p>晚霞本是惹人愛的，尤其是初冬的落霞，更是綺麗得可愛極了。自從秋含着媚笑離開了人間以後，人間就少了一種暖意，少了蔚藍色的天空，少了枝頭上的紅葉。秋，帶走了人間的暖意，也帶走了我内心的熱情，現在，冬又來臨了。</p>
<p>往事，像一張畫幕，在這張畫幕上，没有花朶，没有碧綠的海，也没有遼闊的天空；全是那些灰暗的小道，枯黄的落葉，和冬天的原野；然而，往事，往事我總覺得值得留意的，儘管是創痛也好，血痕也好，我都歡喜牠。</p>
<p>記得前年也是在初冬的季候，我是在祖國南方的一個都市裏生活着，到如今使我常常不能忘記的就是那些笳笛聲，南國的笳笛聲，實在是最迷人的，五月的太陽，福州女人的眼珠子，中秋的月夜，也比不上牠，在一個長年流浪的旅人聽來，牠是一首世間最偉大的哀歌，最偉大的抒情詩，那時候，每到夜深人靜的時候，我總歡喜倚着欄干聽那一隊賣唱的人吹着的笳笛聲，我常常會沉醉在這有節凑的悠揚哀怨的笛聲裏，直到那隊賣唱的人走了，笛聲遠了，我才從沉醉中跳出來。……</p>
<p>假如要説我過去幾年來的生活史上有一頁是感到幸福的話，那末就應該説是這個時候了。</p>
<p>我覺得我是世間最不幸的一個人，幸福，幸福對我永遠是像水中不可撈捉的月影，尤其是在戀愛的塲合中，我受盡了多少的寃屈，受盡了多少的鄙視喲！這隱痛只有我自己了解。爲着愛，我的眼淚流乾了！戀愛，像夢！戀愛，像輕烟！給暴風吹散了。</p>
<p>然而，友人們總以爲我的幸福的，他們只看見我的笑，而不知我天天拿着苦痛來養活我自己！……</p>
<p>這也是往事的一頁。</p>
<p>於今，我得要重新振作起來，對付這生活，對付這環境，不要再作那些荒唐的夢才好！</p>
<h3>慶歷新年的學生</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>山店</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>—大行追記—</p>
<p>打雜囉唣一聲——這是謊話，打雜並未囉唣，大概他明白，拉生意是用不到的，只要車在門口的路上停下，便得在這裏打尖或落脚，因爲再上去就得挨差，名曰「　子」的，車　是一步也不能前進了。打回頭要二十里才能碰上宿店。總之，只要不是乘的飛機，從這里過總得歇一會。開店的雖未必是江湖上人，能十八班武藝件件精通，打拳踢腿來得，買賣也就做的有這麽硬！打雜是一壯年男子，他究竟囉唣了没有，我不知道，但他確實是不慌不忙帮着車户缷丁車的。在這打雜身上决找不出油滑習氣，就近作比，他有些像石頭。爲什麽要説「囉唣一聲」，我想大家都明白，不必細講。</p>
<p>店而且要開在山裏，含着浪漫味兒的。我們這民族不知從何時起了，似乎自始就碰着了不幸的鐵釘，表面上過着安分生活，而心裏老想浪漫一下，但並非虔心願意，而是不得已，爲着不被罪名殺死，看别人浪漫比較合適些，所以大家歡迎水滸傳，又覺得瓦崗寨也錯。中國描寫着「黑店」的説部有多少呢！但是可憐得很，縰然在這荒僻的山裏，也看不見有人拿朴刀板斧截路了。洋槍究竟厲害些。當然，我並非説這裏從不發生殺人事件，這裏雖然也同别處一樣文明，但較之威爾士先生的烏托邦是相差還遠哩！</p>
<p>這是一家山店，因爲開在山裏。</p>
<p>前幾年，據報載有人入山求道，近年來運命更壞了些，更不濟了，盼活佛盼仙使抗日的當愈多了罷，我也弄得想不平常一下了。因爲身在山店，要過見仙俠，恐怕還没有那麽大福氣。但也不悮喪。按説尚不過在大行山大門，口徘徊，離升堂入屋還早，不妨將希望打個折扣，留一半在肚裏。這就好了，剛才那打雜的大漢該不是綠林豪傑？那柴門後探出半個頭的女人，臉像冬瓜皮的確有一番來歷，怪像「母夜叉」。至於那坐有門口石凳上的老傢伙，他頭戴毡笠，口啣旱烟管，自然用不着懷疑，綠林豪傑也是老子娘養的。只是那灶前的瘦漢子想不出該佔一個什麽脚色。他咳嗽着。</p>
<p>四處走走，兼代瞧瞧，還想發現不平常的東西，可是没有：我只見了一口猪同幾隻雞，其餘是農具，不單没有朴刀杆棒，連洋槍也見不到，只有一把鈍斧，那綠林豪傑正劈柴。那冬瓜皮臉的女人也出來了，還抱一個孩子，就坐在大路傍的石凳上餵奶。原來她剛才磨過麵，不單臉是白的，而且從頭到脚都像從石灰裏爬出來一樣。</p>
<p>現在也許有人覺得頗失望了罷，但是且慢，這裏還有一件東西足供諸君往古代遐想。離這山店大約不到二十步光景，有一座石築的門，上面是建築過房子的，現在没有了。這門没有將牠的石子刻在石頭上，店家也不明白牠的歷史，然而是一座關隘絶不會錯，因爲翻幾條嶺過去，便是一個頗稱豐饒的大盆地，而四圍要徑都建有這同樣的門。也許前人在裏邊避過兵燹，也許是竇二墩（是這樣寫？）一流好漢的山寨。</p>
<p>店倚山而建，約有六七間房子的模樣，也有天井，是可以「臥餐山色」的。天已是黄昏。遠處空谷有狗吠。店家趕我客堂裏坐。所謂客堂，是泥屋三間，中供財神，對聯也還是「生意興隆通四海；財源茂盛達三江。」一頭就地攤席，算是鋪，大約店家就睡在上邊，客人乏了，也可以暫且「借光」。店家弄來洗臉水，看了，有一匙，也許多一點，説是跑數里外辦來的。</p>
<p>飯上來了，是麵條，無菜，無醋，無油，單有鹽，等了許久，爲什麽呢？眞不好説出口。可惜，我不曾吃到人肉包子！</p>
<p>吃飯時，我想想能當夜趕進去才好，免得一個不凑巧，失去看「有來歷」的人的機會，就説是仙俠罷！</p>
<h3>嚮晚（二）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>烟館子底陳設，大都是簡陋的，實在没有使那們人那樣眼紅的地方。兩兩相對的，一連十來張板床，各各靠在板壁的一頭。中間留出三五尺闊的空地，做走道。床上大都舖着些席子。有一大半席子是殘破而污穢的。但人們好像非常肯給這席子遮面子，没有張床是空着。人是滿滿的横在席子上。有幾個烟館子呢，且還有在中間空道上，擺上把椅子坐着等的。這些人雖比較街頭那一羣，稍稍高等一點，得有機會「登堂入室」了，但從他們穿着與面貌上看來，却和門外這一羣，抱有同一的人生哲學，所謂人世間底至樂，除爲這一口「烟霧」外，一切皆可隨便。同時，還有平日自以爲多少是個女人，應向一切男子低頭或羞怯的；現在却也莫不横倒在床上，連腿子擱在隣床底男子脚上，也是恬然的了。</p>
<p>初夏的晚間底暖風，偷偷地吹進這些烟館子裏去，又偷偷地把烟館子裏的重霧送了一陣出來。於是館子裏的人，感到更舒暢；而館子外的一羣，也感到些微的滿足了。</p>
<p>小小的破落的街道，充滿了夜的暗影，也充滿了烟的重霧。街燈從這暗影與重霧中開始閃出昏黄的眼，織出了人生底惡夢。——這天生的一對配當，又從這夢之街上走過。</p>
<p>「咯篤！咯篤！咯篤！」的皮鞋聲，和着「咕哺咕哺咕」的橡皮鞋聲。給這夢之街以一種窒息的壓迫。</p>
<p>「討壓！眞是個什麽世界？」高的發恨似的説出。「我在日本時是没有看到過這樣的情形的。我在日本！」説着，似乎自己立變成個高貴的人，且顯示出自己决不是屬於這個地面上的一分子，再加上一句：「中國人全是些没出息的東西。」</p>
<p>「没出息的東西！」矮的接上一句，橡皮鞋咕的踏在窪水上。「我也是這麽想。我走遍半個全中國，全看見這一套呀！這一套。」頓了一頓，接着又噯了二聲下去：「噯！噯！是呀。嫖賭吃着，是中國人底四大德性。然而現在還必須加上這一項。成爲五德。五德，鷄有五德呀！可賀！可賀！」</p>
<p>「呵呵呵」高的笑了！咯篤咯篤咯篤！接着還是這表示生命底高貴的皮鞋聲底示威！</p>
<p>皮鞋聲越響，越高，越響起急促。那個矮的底胸部也越喘越膨脹　白翻領襯衫也越張越開。最後這畸形發達的特别胖瞞的左乳，也從自襯衫張開那兒探出頭來，看這世界的不景氣了。</p>

<p>金市昨以美金條文經最高法院判决、政府勝利、美元减低成色、程序不致受阻、華商力塞美金、滙市硬化、中途雖尚回漲、但漲勢之勁、結果重跌、晨初以海外銀市英縮美平、遠期銀市略漲、滙兑一致上升、倫敦生金跌一便士半、塲外預備交易開出、雖减十六七元、但乏買户、賣方趁勢活動、即告下跌、良以報載美最高法院已將金條文判决勝利歸於政府、而我國財部亦已令准各商業團體、呈請奬勵白銀進口辦法等訊、大户如大發永恒餘萬興俱賣、而跌至十一二元、乾昌祥福餘永利大發永趁低進至四元外、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英平美升、海關金單位跌二厘、標金標準價爲九四七元二角、毫無影響、開後一度續跌、買方趁低補進、逐漸回升、預悉匯豐掛牌英平而美升一八七五、頗多挣扎、入後銀行紛紛扒結、内盤頓緊、買方連袂活躍、而漲到二十元關外、惟漲勢仍歉有勁、是以銀行趁貴一塞、又難維持、而告下挫、沙遜願抛近期先令、一度回跌、不久因銀行趁賤仍扒、而漸上漲、無如漲勢見高而止、人心終覺不定、賣方前來活動、仍難持久、大户連袂脱手、浮多節節潰散、以致午刻重疲、後市人心萎疲、多方爭先了結、而破入十元關内、但因銀行尚扒、尚能回漲、趁高縱有供給、此時銀行一再扒結、印銀亦未更動、掙扎殊烈、迨後銀行納胃稍滯、賣方仍湧、大户何某王某俱售、逐漸下游、良以元茂永趁低猛購、頑强抵抗、終以人心渙散、趨勢難支、謡傳略盛、大户爭先斬多、滙市更硬、而造九○五元之新低價、印銀二次未動低後略升、但以雙結價關係、最後呈掙扎局面、查一天市况初穩後疲、漲勢見高而無勁、賣方得以乘隙活動、今將一天市况誌後、</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>人力難支念三關一瀉二三元</p>
<p>九六亦跟跌六七角</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市價大都趨疲、廿三關反動驟起、多方已現裂痕、所謂政府收回一説、完全捕風捉影、操縱家亦不免爲人所算、無法拉提、大勢已去、操縱者亦可以反省、九六一種、以各大户多頭異常擁擠、多頭場外掉期、大都遭對方拒絶、銀根奇緊、又無收貨、大多數均預備出範、少數尚在掉期、二月份存帳數、尚有八百餘萬、前途尚有危險也、市况情形、因銀根尚有奇緊之勢、聞洋米進口、需欵約五六千萬元、而錢莊六個月長期欵、爲數極鉅、約有八九千萬元、大概在三四月間到期、似此情形、銀錢業難免脱貨求財、九六爲無本無利之貨、當然首當其衝、套利交易不起、市價前途、尚難樂觀也、昨日經過、各債市大都盤旋向下、交易以掉期爲多、廿三關因廿一號首先奮勇賣出、逐盤出脱、愈賣愈勇、全日售賣、爲數約有二三百萬之鉅、市價乃無法維持、每况愈下、九六賣户、異常踴躍、四十一號逐盤出籠、二十號多頭、亦紛紛出脱、其餘多頭掉期、亦風起雲湧、其風波一時尚不易平息也、市價結果、普通略小五分一角至三角、九六小六七角、廿三關猛瀉二三元、驚濤駭浪、接踵而起、前途尚有風波也、成交總數、計共一千三百八十八萬、兹將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<p>金條文案宣判後紐約股市紛紛狂漲</p>
<p>新豐洋行報告、昨（十八日）紐約股市、漲勢激厲、交易極活、人氣之佳、近所罕見、有令人回憶一九二九年前繁榮時代之感、金幣條文案一經宣判、全國各地之定單迅即一湧而至、勢如狂流、以全日計、當達五百萬股之讚、先是投機家預料政府當不能全勝、故交易所職員立在塲中、苟市况崩潰、預備立即宣佈停市、乃判决結果出諸此輩意料之外、市面全未防備、鐵道股之漲勢尤勁、愛去孫鐵路一度曾暴漲十元半、鐵路公司發行之金債劵特多、故鐵路債劵挺進達五元光景、判决之宣佈又引起金銀股空頭之補進、各猛騰約七元之譜、市面暴漲後、旋復靜寂、發生反動、但至收盤前則又回高、債市於宣判後亦狂跳飛漲、自中午至午後一句鐘間、進出約達七百萬元、旋亦回復平靜狀態、無金幣條文之財部庫劵打破以前之最高紀錄、綜計於三十秒鐘内、高漲五元至十元、金幣條文公債則相形見絀、價稍低落、鐵路債劵之風頭景健、公司債劵一度亦曾高漲達五元之譜、小交易所股票雖遭多頭之乘高了結、但能維持而不墜、有若干種亦高漲達五元之多、蒙脱里銀價於宣判後升起半分、全日成交一百九十一萬股、兹將道瓊斯紐約指數列左、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>標紗花盤旋之局</p>
<p>紗紗市晨進午退、形勢顯呈盤旋之局、前昨兩日某公司斬結之額額巨、市盤未受影響、完全散户獲利抵補所致、至於本月份紗、據市塲言、限價到一百七十六元有大户收進税、今則美棉回漲、人心尤穩、故市狀尚帶平靜、但多數心理觀疲云、</p>
<p>金雞晨俏午回</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈堅挺之象、因美棉政治消息利於多頭而漲、人心帶緊、而某兩大公司之多頭、在前昨兩日斬結完畢、尚有買方、皆有相當凖備、暫時不動、於是浮空紛紛抵補、市盤上升、結果各月均漲四·五·六·九角、午後開盤聞現紗交易冷澹、成交岑寂、大孚代某公司由多翻空、市盤突然下落、各月均跌四·五·六·七·角、查賣出大孚二千八百五十包、均昶四百包、長豐三千四百五十包、同興三百包、買進大豐二千一百包、梅記六百包、穗隆四百五十包、益昶一千包、生源五百五十包、源大四百包、遠大五百五十包、泰昌四百包、錦昌四百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>紗銷五百餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路較前爲清、查全日各帮買去統計五百四十五包、行情平靜、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>蘆州　四○　南京　　五　内地　二五五</p>
<p>廣東　二五　同行　一五　甯波　　　三</p>
<p>四川　七五　長沙　四○　河南　　一○</p>
<p>雲南　六○</p>
<p>花市始漲繼跌、但美棉因金條文案業已判决、而漲十七磅音、惟印棉跌二羅比、金價漲而復落、故人心平疲、據棉業中人云、滬埠存貨充足、銀根緊迫、對於棉市仍屬看小、但源大之空額、悉數扒清矣、</p>
<p>鄭標無甚上落</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、良以美棉轉漲、金條文案判决後、美國雜糧市場飛漲、多數人心對外棉前途看漲、塲中籌碼較枯、市氣尤見緊俏、散户扒空雲集、故市盤愈開愈硬、又有一説、本月份緯通廠有存貨二千擔説、各月均漲一角半至二角半、午後開盤、市氣驟變、形勢愈衰、因金市由漲而復跌、本埠現棉存貨甚厚、山東濟南鄭州漢口等處大批棉花、尚未運出、對於前途未許樂觀、故各月又跌一角一角半至二角、不過市塲檯風、不若前日之慌矣、查賣出通記一千四百擔、大孚二千八百擔、泰興一千擔、信誠一千二百擔、益康一千六百擔、益豐一千四百擔、長和四千一百擔、均昶一千三百擔、潤康一千擔、買進同孚二千八百擔、通記一千三百擔、源大四千一百擔、賡豐一千二百擔、恊成一千一百擔、源興昌三千一百擔、大豐一千擔、錦昌一千三百擔、遠大四千一百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>廠需祇有零星</p>
<p>現棉銷塲尚平淡、但零星交易尚不間斷、來源計姚花一百包、通花四十包、</p>
<p>美棉爲金條文案帶起</p>
<p>經紀商紛紛買進：漲起十六七磅音</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因多頭了結、及神經過敏者賣出、各月跌二至四磅音、金條文案判决後、先前賣出者急速買回、同時華爾街有力、經紀商亦紛紛買進、所有買方轉出之額、均爲吸收、價乃猛漲、同業方面、以爲此項判决可使紡織業及現貨增加活動、收盤堅昂、計現貨漲十五磅音、期貨漲十六至十九磅音、英棉市况平疲、計現貨漲二點、期貨跌三四點、印棉先因歐洲出口商買進而漲、後因多頭獲利了結而回、計平果爾漲半羅比、奧姆辣二·二五羅比、白羅溪跌一·六二五羅比、原電錄左、（十八日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十九日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百五十一羅比、較上日收盤三·八七五羅比、</p>
<p>蘭貢花之輸出量</p>
<p>十八日孟買電、上週從蘭貢輸出之棉花數量爲一、一九九包、計至利物浦者二二五包、至漢堡者三七五包、至勃利門者五○○包、至安脱華者九九包、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>粉市現象近穩遠平</p>
<p>昨日期紛市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先平後穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲五六七角左右、坎拿大漲一角零、當開價後、本月份因浮多略出、開價小去半分、遠期各月份、則因洋麥報漲、人心仍然平定、至二盤之後、本月份因現銷活絡、人心復見帶定、惟遠期則因前日大廠續定澳麥一船、價祇四元七角半、故抛貨較多、市氣亦轉軟弱、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、已轉清淡、本月份因現貨趨緊、仍然帶住、遠期則廠方微出、稍形鬆落、觀察後步、恐呈近穩遠平之象也、結果本月份小二厘半、三月份至五月份小半分、六月份小二厘半、七月份不動云、</p>
<p>阿麥廉宜本麥活動</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面大致平靜、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲五六七角不等、坎拿大漲一角零、當開價後、二三月份、市氣盤旋之中、微呈軟弱、因洋麥報價雖漲、惟現洋麥則依然步鬆、如前日澳麥定開一船、價祇四元七角半、昨則阿麥喊價、聞祇三元五角、是以人心難以抬動也、結果二月份跌二分、三月份跌二分、現麥市面、見交甚見暢旺、因銀根關係、貨客求脱、廠胃亦因現粉去化較殷、進胃不懈、開高郵麥三元八角三分、蜂埠麥三元九角三分、海州麥宿州麥均三元九角五分、共開八千餘包、由福新阜豐申大等廠辦進云、</p>
<p>小麥　雜糧明日開盤、或將較高、但恐離有多大之高漲、小麥可見供給减少二百八十五萬一千蒲歇爾、與預料者略等、</p>
<p>日商起而採辦麩皮</p>
<p>麩皮市面、日來步趨堅挺、因各廠存底甚枯、復以大廠减少車數、致需要一起、不免難以應付、聞日商已經活動、連日均鑡批購、内地帮亦接續採辦、因此喊價步升、各麩已喊至二元七角半、據業中人之推測、如現化仍活、尚看續漲之勢</p>
<p>洋莊芝蔴再跌一角</p>
<p>黄豆暫乏上漲力</p>
<p>昨日黄豆市况、雖承上日之緊風、但少上漲之力、故市價仍居原盤、漢口豆在人心看漲之中、市勢亦見跌定、昨全市開頴州豆十車、價爲三元七角半至八角、歸德豆三百餘包、價爲三元八角半、蚌埠豆一車、價爲三元七角、均由油廠家辦去、漢口乍豆本街及内地帮成交一千五百餘包、價自三元六角四至五角、芝蔴洋莊去路轉活、計怡和沙逼等辦去千餘噸、價開九元七角、比前又跌一角、現貨尚屬平平、昨有東洋帮採去湖南净黄蔴一百噸、價爲七元七角六分、</p>
<p>米市無甚榮辱</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源因經一朝停斛、到船頓見稍湧、計共有五十餘號、（貨共近萬石）惟銷塲未爽、各厚粳價僅蘇同帮因本街進胃尚佳、稍加五分外、餘如常帮南港等帮悉無榮辱、而各晚稻帮亦以包胃祇青島一帮辦二三百包、同現平定之色、至於杜尖及陰變元等各花色、均無軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）前昨二日、河下各路來源三四十號、市上各貨去胃淡弱、白粳及薄稻價小一角、客元及中次本元價疲數分、杜尖亦疲近尺、其餘各色價無上落、</p>
<p>三號西貢内地暢銷</p>
<p>昨日洋米客化稍淡、惟貨主心思仍堅、售價反爲喊高、尤以三號西貢爲内地各路歡迎、定貨雖多尚未到申、而市上存底早經售去甚多、浮存既少、囤貨居奇、昨日全市只開三千多包、價則又漲五分以上、西貢一號米及碎米等共開四千多包、期二百噸、概由内地本街分去、市亦堅站、客秈存到兩少、貨主始終望好、但昨日成交不到千包、價亦堅定云、</p>
<h3>海味</h3>
<p>蟄皮到存兩缺暴漲</p>
<p>海蟄皮滬上行家存貨、均告枯缺、山客方面、如岱山·泗礁·黄龍·衢山等處、久乏來貨、惟羊山略有到貨、但爲數寥寥、隨到即通、致成供不敷求之象、而川漢汕廣等客帮、均有胃口、待貨添辦、故行家存積之貨、莫不扳高而售、昨市叫升陳皮價十八元、新皮十六元、蟄頭九元五角、且多不願出售者、據業中人云、如非山客來貨轉湧、尚有陸續再漲之勢、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>黑鐵釘開出甚夥</p>
<p>黑鐵釘新近交易已有發展、如長江·四川·烟台·青島·天津諸帮、對於進胃十分强健、故連日開出爲數甚夥、市上行情因存底薄弱、兼之到貨不多、所以十分堅挺、現市如三分每箱（六百包）估五十二元、四分五十元、五分五十元零五角、六分四十八元、如三百包每箱估二十七元、四分五分二十五元五角、六分二十四元五角、查開出之數、共有三百餘箱之多、聞目下市上執有此種存貨者、祇有三四家而已、所以對於估盤一層、異常扳高、預料行情一節、將來恐有續好之望、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>絲市依然沉悶</p>
<p>滬埠對外絲銷、依然寂靜、沉悶之市氣、一時似未易開展、海外絲市、雖略形見漲、（花旗一元四角二分、東洋六百五十元）奈滙價堅長如故、致發電問價恒相距三十元之巨、且廠商亦不願過份遷就、因此一無成交者、用户方面、納胃不殷、只零昨買賣而已、目前絲市只在觀望盤旋中</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>時計</h3>
<p>— 戈白</p>
<p>小時候在鄉下與牧童爲伍，不知時計爲何物。抬起頭來觀測太陽，就知道吃飯睡覺的時候。在陰雨天，也能以經騐所得來規定牠；即使稍有遲早，於世無爭的鄉下人是没有關係的。</p>
<p>有幾年收穫太好，爸爸羡慕「詩禮傳家」的紅字條兒，就把我送進了學堂。那時除了告訴讀書之外、我更知道了時間的重要。譬如七時起身，半時後早餐，九時上課等等。如果還是抬起頭來觀測太陽，這學堂不變收容所者幾希。而且視學員何時到校，校長一定先一二小時吩咐學生校役各式人等，灑掃庭除，整理課室，然後能博得一張懸在鏡架中的奬狀。</p>
<p>於是我從此牢記着時計的重要了，想着我將來做校長時也買一個拉着那樣長長鍊子的圓東西，校長時常掏出來看着時不够威武的嗎？</p>
<p>後來到上海來讀書，第一件事我化了五塊大洋買來那個威武的時計。在火車站上我時常掏出來告訴我爸爸火車還有幾分鐘要來了，但是我那個蹩脚東西跑得太快，稍稍使我失望。——校長那個價值一定不小的吧？心中老是掛記着。</p>
<p>這裏我想提一提我讀書很用功，拿了兩年列入甲等的報告單，就向爸爸申讀買了一個十幾元時計，從此相安無事。</p>
<p>但進了中學，這時計又失了效力。六點鐘敲了起身鐘，却没有一個同學起身，我的錶上雖也指着六點，我却不敢説牠一定是凖確的。上課同是如此，教員踏進教室總比規定時間延長五分五十分。甚至後來學會了看電影，我的錶老是跑得太快。</p>
<p>有一次，我的朋友結婚，我上了時計的當不小，我凖時去參觀婚禮，那些辦事人告訴我新郎自己都没有來，到吃罷飯返校幾乎關在校門之外。不得不照舊應用老法子，抬起頭來觀測太陽，倒反蠻凖個，這一點我們鄉下人可以傲矣。</p>
<p>最後講一個關於時計的笑話，那是從外國報上看來的：</p>
<p>有一個呌湯姆的，時計壞了不去修理，其友傑克責問他，湯姆説：「這樣，一天有二個時候是最凖確的。」</p>
<p>然而這個方法在中國還是不通用，我們需要的是一天甚至没有二個凖確的時候的時計。</p>
<h3>小漁孃</h3>
<p>— 三郎</p>
<p>海濱的冬天依然是那麽温暖的，雖然有狂暴的海風不斷地飄盪着大地上的一切，那好像是老遠的印度洋吹送來的暇流的氣息一樣，給人們感到没有什麽可怕的霜寒。有時天空湧出了凄切的愁雲地吊下一串一串的細雨，也曾把海濱上顯出孤獨的悲凉來。</p>
<p>那兒總是遼遠的浮鬆的黄土層，上面長着那麽碧綠而軟柔的蘆葦草，没有一息間的停止地在飄盪着。除了老遠的農村的景色和崎嶇的山腰在濛迷的霧里浮現以外，在海濱上再找不到什麽景物了。</p>
<p>那時候我是一個農塲的工作者，我帶着深刻的都市病到那兒給天然的野景和新鮮的海風療治，我很高興，我希望能够得到美麗的結果呢。</p>
<p>——一個淪在時代的病態的年輕人哪。</p>
<p>是的，我每天是跟着兩個好友，做那能療養我的病體的工作，雖然一向在都市里舒服慣了的人，却也能够跟着農夫們的勞動作業呢。</p>
<p>在海濱上最給我不能忘記的是那些撲實而勇敢的漁翁和天眞活潑的小漁孃。是的，那死一般冷靜的海濱，每天除掉那一些漁人們再没其他的影子了。所以，我們很快地便和他們她們打起招呼來。日子一天一天的過去，我們便認識了他們在一百年前從廣海那邊兒遷移過來的。他們的村子離開我們約模二里多遠的地方，我們可以瞧見得很清楚的。那是陳舊的泥磚屋，村子里的人們至多不過一百個的，而且大都出了門。只剩着那些老漁翁婦人，小孩子們吧了。</p>
<p>每天，每們可以瞧見幾個十多歲的小姑娘和小孩子們沿着海岸線捕魚蝦的，有時，在鬆浮的土層上掘取小蟲。她們都是戴着竹笠小帽兒，那麽撩人的活潑的姿態總是可愛的，她們不像都市的小孩子們一樣的驕傲，她們所有的都是頑皮而無惡意的。</p>
<p>我們和她們做起朋友來還有一件很有趣味兒的故事呢。那是一個傍晚的時分，西邊的山峰上還吊着那麽淡的紅霞，冬晚的寒意已漸漸兒濃厚了。我們從老遠的地方掉着小舟歸來，到了她們的村子里的時候，從業密的蘆葦草中間可以瞧着那老舊的小屋子沉默地。那時有四個十三歲樣子的小姑娘們在活潑地跳躍着，給我們驚動驚動了。她們很迅速地便跑到岸邊來瞧。是的。她們還帶着一點羞意的微笑呢。</p>
<p>——小姑娘！你們吃過了夜飯嗎？</p>
<p>——你間做什麽？跟着放出那迷人的淺笑來。</p>
<p>——倘如你們還没有吃，便請你們到我們的園子裏來吃的。好嗎？</p>
<p>——早就吃過了。一個最年輕的天眞地説了。</p>
<p>——你的名字咧！</p>
<p>——金魚兒哪。她們又在笑着。</p>
<p>——你們天天到我們那邊兒來玩吧！那兒有美麗的故事聽的。你們的爸爸不會駡你們的，他們早就做了我們的好朋友了。</p>
<p>——知道了，可是，現在快要天黑下來了。</p>
<p>是婉轉的笑聲把我們送着，我們的心靈是那麽愉快的呵！</p>
<p>以後，她們做了我們最好的朋友了，常常聚在一塊談笑的。我們從她們的嘴裏得很許多有趣的故事，無疑的，她們也曾給我們都市的故事迷着呵。</p>
<h3>宿店夜記</h3>
<p>— 克明</p>
<p>没來由地，可又下起細濛濛的雪花來了，天空黄漫漫的一片，像戈壁大沙漠的没有邊際的沙海，北方的天氣是慣跟人作對的，可没有江南那樣子的稱心呢。</p>
<p>而還有一件不凑巧的，便是：天却漸漸地在暗下來了；客人坐在車篷裏瑟瑟抖，冷，而且怕；趕車的呢，他們是着實能捉摸到一點客人的心意的，早就在心下盤算怎樣可以讓自己有一夜暖和的坑睡，與討碗把黄酒熱肚了，便裝起了一副正經的聲氣説：「看樣子，這爛雪多少總得挨上那麽一天半夜，再走上一個半時辰的話，天早就黑得跟三再頭一個樣子了，雪夜裏趕車，不但恐怕牲口受不住，就代爺們想，身上帶了點兒貨，恐怕也不方便，不如就找個店落吧。」</p>
<p>其實，担心的倒並不是那些總共不到二十塊錢的上下的「貨」——那些頭痛</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>粉傷膏藥一類的藥品跟丸散膏丹，拿去也没什麽用處；而同車的三個客人全都凍得臉色鐵青，牙齒發抖，手脚也僵硬得難以彈動了，那倒是事實，一聽到了那樣的話，便商量也不用商量，大家點一點頭，同意地呌趕車的就近找一家「老實」一點的宿店歇上那麽一夜再説。</p>
<p>車在不平的道路上有一步没一步地滚，輪子的不快意的聲音伴着隱約的牲口的呵氣，雪珠打在車篷上，聽着就覺得一陣寒，風把車簾吹起的時候，我們看見外面的天光已經黑透了。</p>
<p>又走了兩丈光景，我們便在一家破落的，在門前掛着「招商客寓」的紙燈籠的小宿店裏，像塞外遇見了親人一個樣子的，高興得了不得地宿下來了。</p>
<p>雖然瞧着就挺明白，那樣光景的破院子裏是没好供養的，可是左右總比縮　　　　　好受點，而且趕車的也不肯多走路了。所以一歇下，便在一間比較寛大的西客房裏住了。</p>
<p>熱水洗過手脚，擦過了帶着泥土氣的臉巾，坑也生起了，三個客人擠在坑上煨煖，一邊順便等燒起來的熱飯和酒，伙計掇上了黄黄的大保險燈，屋子裏便有了小小的燈火了。</p>
<p>店家爲了想省點油火，却把晚飯放到外面的堂屋裏去了。「客人們大家都在堂屋裏用飯，也好多交幾位朋友，出門人全靠朋友啊，哈，哈，哈…」</p>
<p>這麽着，在店家的應酬中，我們便走到堂屋裏，雜在新的與老的客人中間了。</p>
<p>走方郎中，跑江湖的，賣藝的，販皮貨的，還有靠六顆骰子過日子的「靠朋友的」……</p>
<p>飯後，没有事，偶而幾個人坐得近，身子一靠：「您家是……？」</p>
<p>「不敢，…販藥材的……」便那麽扯東扯西地談起來了</p>
<p>「喝，您家别見　，我説，這年頭還什麽藥料，人連大餅子都没剩，還吃藥？今年伏裏，您不知道，鄉裏都染上了瘟痧，可是那個不是這樣呢，偌：一兩天，斷了氣，就跟你挖個潭子一埋了事，還有誰……喝……」</p>
<p>有人插嘴了：「這年頭，到處都是死路。」</p>
<p>「怎麽不是呢，眞的呀，天也變了，活了五六十歲，交春了，還這冷…」</p>
<p>屋角裏又有三兩個人在打合人賭骰子了，聲音雜亂得像馬嘶。</p>
<p>「喝，荒亂的世界，人的性命還没幾顆骰子值錢哩……」</p>
<p>人都有了一點凄楚的神色；可是，我們一夥却打起呵欠來了，想起了天一亮還得走好多的泥濘的路程……</p>
<h3>在風里挣扎着</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>葉落風捲的時候，有一片重霧浮上了阿毛的心頭—</p>
<p>「天，這樣冷，風，襲　着一切，颼颼地，沙沙地，怎樣的渡過這嚴冬？」</p>
<p>於此，他　悵了，種種的思慮緊咬着他的情緒。</p>
<p>「棉衣，被褥，火！」他在想：「這四角五一天的代價，怎……唉！」</p>
<p>「這兩天，妻傷風子，爬不起來，一歲多的孩子也咳嗽不住：是的，他們都缺乏禦寒物喲！」</p>
<p>「醫生嗎？哼，壓根别想，窮人的命不必他們耽心，死不了……」</p>
<p>頭腦，暈脹着，紛亂着，在他的意識上暴跳着無數的火花。</p>
<p>在一個自然的回合裏，他意識到一幅優美的畫圖—</p>
<p>燈，光亮的，乳白色，浴着靜潔寛敞的房間，水汀，適宜的調和着寒冷的空氣，香烟，輕輕地，嬝嬝地，繚繞着，無綫電在報告着本日的行情：</p>
<p>—標金，開盤××××元……</p>
<p>另一個回合裏，他又憧憬到，燈光照不到的地方，一些難以分辨面貌的動物在爬行，踡伏，瑟抖，枯葉在風捲中申訴：</p>
<p>—動物喲，等着吧，你的一切是註定在北風裏了。</p>
<p>一陣凉意敲擊着他，他驚嚇着：「你的一切是註定在北風裏」的有如洪鐘的聲浪，震蕩着他的耳鼓，於此，他想到那北風的聲勢，姿態，和日落嵫崦似的生命地悲哀。</p>
<p>他惶恐着，想呌，想跑，終而笑了——偶然的幻覺在眼前飛閃，他發現體面的行人在北風裏被「註定的挣扎者」圍困着，威嚇着，企望着。</p>
<p>雖然是一個極深的陷阱，但他，好像是一條平坦的大道，靜臥着，他笑，禁不住的笑，無窮的熱氣包圍了他，跨出了房門，步上了幽暗悠長底路。</p>
<p>這邊，那邊，他拖着瘦長的影子，在接受這北風的侵施！在和這北風挣扎。</p>
<h3>關於臘梅</h3>
<p>— 羅姗</p>
<p>生活是架無止境的循環旋律，不斷地轉動着輪子又一個冬天的來到，人變成一架混蒙的機械了，關於冬天我一向没有什麽好感，時常想，冬天應該全屬於資産階級的，像我們這一羣，似乎不該有這麽一個季候呢？</p>
<p>委實，冬天除「雪」我由詩意的出　點愛好他外要算，那祇是臘梅了。臘梅於我所以有緣，是有我不可磨滅的關係在，那彷彿自己的母親在我内心刻上烙印是同一的。</p>
<p>我家的院子裏是有兩顆臘梅的，每到冬天剛含苞時我已忙着拆，而母親終不凖許，有次我氣得哭起來，她才免强用小剪子絞下三四枝，按進長案上那插有千日紅，竹枝的大瓶子裏，一邊插下那花，一邊拉着我，</p>
<p>「孩子，你爸爸更不凖你折了，你明白這全爲着你自己的幸福才愛好它的。」</p>
<p>當時，我委實不懂研究爲什麽，我那小心靈老感得父母那麽神秘地對於庭邊的臘梅是個奇蹟，直到十歲那年才曉得，原來二十多年不曾關過花朶的臘梅，在生我那年忽然盛開着，於是由於愛惜他們的女兒而珍惜着臘梅，因此我的地位也更好起來，因爲我是「吉利的幸運者。」</p>
<p>雖然自從父母培植我以大學教育後，我反而變成更不幸起來，同時爲着那種所謂不幸，而不曾實踐父母的期望之股，我四五年不敢回去，也愧見倚閭熱望我的雙親，然而每到冬天，在霜雪裏耐寒獨放的臘梅，没有間斷我去探視它們的熱心，今年，生活的鞭子逼我在K地了，那滿夾道的孤山是一片黄金色，當太陽偶由陰霾的天空探出頭來。我和朋友們耐着刺骨的寒冷，終于徒行在裏西湖的孤山，我鼻子嗅着清芬的香氣，年齡彷彿開了倒車，童年又在眼前復活着，我那右手拍着那盛開的一棵，内心在做默禱。</p>
<p>「如果你們中的朋友，那生長於我的家庭中的一對，要正是象徵我幸運的話，在廢歷的新年裏，當給予我一切的順利，當然我不希望富貴，僅僅能使我平凡地不愁生少便滿足了。」</p>
<p>於是我自己大笑着了，引得朋友也大笑起來，但她們的笑是合我的笑不同的。</p>

<h3>一年來英國汽車事業之驚人進展</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>華克斯好史丹達出口最多</p>
<p>在已往一年之中。英國各汽車廠營業方面。有驚人之進展。是故出口數量。突然增加不少。以價值言。大致收入方面。可增多一，○○○，○○○金鎊。出口方面。其中更以運往新西蘭及澳洲爲多數。蓋最近英國當局。决議减低汽車徵税而後。使車廠方面。同時能製造高馬力汽車。結果可使汽車事業之進展。及海外市塲之推廣。乃爲必然之事也。在過去十二個月中。客車之産數。總共二五六，八六六輛。而前年總數祇二二○，七七九輛。至於貨車。過去一年。共産八五，六三三輛。而前年祇六五，五○八輛。即此已可見英國各汽車廠。上年度客車貨車之産數。均較往年爲增進也。各車廠之營業狀况。其中最見發展者。莫如華克斯好。蓋歲尾年頭。傳出消息。謂該廠獲利之多。使股東之紅利較前年所分得者增加百分之七十五。總共分派紅利二六一，五六二金鎊。華克斯好輕便六缸汽車。行銷海外者最多。蓋各國人士。至英國旅行。見華克斯好之成績驚人。莫不樂於購用也。是故華克斯好之在海外。自前行銷所及。已達六十七個邦國之多。自岡文德里傳來之消息。則上年度史丹達車廠所銷售之車輛。在該廠歷史上。造成一空前未有之紀錄。而以目前之情形言。則未來年一之中。將有更新之紀錄。可斷言也。蓋史丹達廠自創辦人摩特斯萊不久之前逝世而後。内部組織。略有變動。董事會中。彭德被選爲主席。代替摩特斯萊之職位。而赫勃脱不久將任銷貨經理。渠爲摩特斯萊之内弟。在史丹達廠已服務多年。勃辣克則將繼續任經理指導之職。</p>
<p>我人在討論英國車廠過去一年中之出口情形時。尚有一事。當爲讀者一述者。即上年度羅爾魯意廠。所産飛機引擎。出口數量。尤見特多。其中更大部分由此利時購去。用以裝置乘客飛機者。然亦有不少用以裝在戰鬥機轟炸機上者。此種引擎。因速度之特出。故最近如荷蘭。葡萄牙。丹麥等國。亦相率訂購。最近在斯羅夫地方。舉行汽車競賽之時。有一車輛。突然起火。而結果爲石棉所熄滅。於是英國汽車中採用石棉之價值。亦因而得以證明。近年以來。汽車之行駛途中。因衝撞或其他原因而發生火患者。時有所聞。甚有傷人害命之事件者。乃此次着火而後。用石棉布一方掩於火燄之上。當即撲滅。於是亦知石棉防火之成績矣。</p>
<p>最近更有英國製造之商用汽車兩船。　　　　　　此種車輛。均爲最新出品。　　　　　行海外者。如温古華英國哥侖比電力鐵路局購一ＡＥＣ蘭傑爾公共汽車。裝有ＡＥＣ利卡杜柴油引擎。而擬行駛於殖民地者。過往同樣之車輛用汽油引擎者。雖曾購過不少。然柴油引擎。則尚爲初次也。十二月份。米蘭意大利公共汽車公司。更訂購ＡＥＣ電力引擎之單層公共汽車一輛。此車之底盤爲　字六六二式。馬達所發出之馬力。可達八十匹。南非電車公司。亦訂購公共汽車底盤五十架。其中三十架用以裝配雙層公共汽車。而二十架則裝配單層者。均裝有再發雷機。及電阻器之塞車者。爲萊沙姆廠之出品云。</p>
<p>英國勃根海特公司　所有通行之公共汽車　爲數達一百輛以上。内中大部分爲萊拉廠之出品。而該廠過去一年之中。因用此種汽車之故。營業方面。嬴餘達二二，○○○金鎊之多。倫敦交通當局。鑒於英國製公共汽車。過往有此驚人成績。故預算表上。亦撥經費五，○○○金鎊。專作移去一部分舊有電車軌道之用。改駛公共汽車者。將來是項經費逐年撥用。以二八，○○○金鎊爲限。英國方面。過去　年。路局更有採用内燃引擎之趨勢　蓋蒸氣火車之不經濟。已爲明顯之事實。不獨英國。各國皆然。如目前英國桑耐克勞夫廠所製引擎。由南美及波蘭採用者。即爲一例。關於此事。我人可爲讀者提出者。即引擎之中。所有傳動系統。所具優點。不一而足。其中最爲顯著者。即華斯辛克萊式之換流機及義式换流機之代替通常之齧合子及齒輪盒。駕馭之時自始至終。有特出之加速力。行動之時。絶無絲毫震力。足以擾及乘客者。各部機件。更皆較往日經濟。此種引擎及換流機。裝置於底盤之中。可適合於其他各種車輛。以其行駛之時。震力全無。成績之優。爲一般引擎所勿及也。</p>
<h3>赫德森與地上飛新車到申</h3>
<p>具有兩大最新進步</p>
<p>鋼車頂與電動排擋</p>
<p>一九三五年式赫德森與地上飛新車。陳列於本埠經告商。利喴汽車公司。與龍飛汽車公司樣子間。以供衆覽。新車姿態較前低長　機力較前充實。而其動作效能。亦更駕　　而上之。新車具有汽車業之兩大最新進步。即鋼頂車身。與電動排擋。是也。惟其裝配鋼頂。故乘客得以安坐於堅實安靜鋼質車廂之内。而同時復可享受盡美盡善之通風。至於電動排擋。則使前廂全部廓清。而駕車者。並可獲得眞正指尖管理之便利。</p>
<p>赫德森汽車公司。對於一九三五年度出品。决定製造一特别組。及華貴組地上飛六缸車。其輪距爲一一二寸。至全組赫德森汽車。則有一一六寸，一一七寸，及一二四寸，輪距三種。赫德森大六缸式。爲一九三五年新出品。以九十三匹馬力引擎。裝配於一一六寸輪距底盤之上。至赫德森華貴八缸式。計有五種式樣。輪距一一七寸。馬力一一三匹。除此以外。赫德森八缸車。尚有兩種式樣。即通行式同樂轎車。及通行式勃羅亭轎車是也。兩者輪距均爲一二四寸。馬力一一三匹。</p>
<p>新車各項進步中之又一最足稱述者。厥爲重新設計之制動系。塞車鼓今爲特種合金鋼科。精工機製。其截面增益百分之二十。是以彌極堅强。再因採用新式輪轉均等器。塞車壓力之及於塞車履者。因以絶對相等。至於選擇排擋。係用電力。得心應手。彌便運用。再調排桿既經廢除。爲使前部地位。愈能廓清起見。特將各式車上之手塞車。由前廂中央。移至另一位置。即在右旁表板車頸部份之下。於是地位出空。毫無阻碍。而其應用之靈便。則與原有位置相較。且更勝一籌焉。</p>
<p>新車車身外觀。與其搆造之堅强鞏固。以及裝璜設備等等。並皆具有極大進步。其形式之壯麗。姿態之曼妙。極美觀悦目。動人之至。全鋼車頂。確爲車身整個搆造之一部份。嚴密銲合。牢固異常。而新車之堅强程度。亦遂因而登峰造極。逈不可及。新車各種式樣。一律裝配新式通風系。置身其中。極感舒暢。至於車身式樣。凡二十有六種。四組赫德森。及兩組地上飛。均可裝配之。</p>
<p>圖示一九三五年式赫德森與地上飛新車，裝有電動排擋，駕駛人祇須以手指一撥，即可調排，至兩手把握駕駛盤，固無庸移開也</p>

<h3>大有進步之新道奇</h3>
<p>— 篔</p>
<p>不論以内容外觀。或任何方面而言。無不出色當行之一九三五年式新道奇汽車。自運抵此間以後。本埠經售商中國汽車公司。甫經將其展覽。即已引起汽車界人士之極大注意。新車所具優點。不勝枚舉。即如駕駛特别舒適。格外經濟合算。美妙動人之流綫式車身。以及驚人價值。與機力益臻灑滿充實等。蓋皆其犖犖大者。新車寛敞偉大。爲歷來所不及。至於機械及車身方面。則其所具有之基本進步。都凡九十五種。除此以外。舉凡道奇以歷年來堅强可靠之服務。而盛名獨享之一切著名特色。如全鋼安全車身。浮力引擎托架。以及道奇水壓塞車等。且莫不兼而有之。</p>
<p>新車除車央完全重新設計外。其研究盡善之種種改革。約略言之。計有道奇高壓引擎。諧動前輪懸置。通風接合器。諧動變速機。特優水壓塞車。以及引擎與底盤方面種種特色。按新車若干管理動作。在昔須由駕駛人負責運用者。今則完全出於自動。凡此特長。蓋即上述種種改進。有以致之也。</p>
<p>車身内部。因係採用視綫清晰之完善通風系。置身其中。自然倍感安適。至於特式前輪懸置。其搆製之佳。固不待言。今則以車之彈簧支承重量。業經重新支配。故其效用尤極宏偉。按所謂重新支配方法。使原動力機之位置。移前八寸。而以前置於後輪軒上之轎車後座。則移前六寸。因斯所有乘客。其座位均恰要置於輪軒之間。其所感受之舒適。誠非一般車座所可同日而語。説者以爲道奇出品。素以安全可靠。馳譽世界。今新車復具有如許優點。則其益爲世人所愛好。而樂於購備蓋無待著龜也。</p>
<h3>七馬力式奧斯汀突破火車新紀錄</h3>
<p>— 軼</p>
<p>頃據墨爾缽消息。特别定造之班迪哥至墨爾缽特快火車。近曾以二小時又十九分鐘之時間。完成其行程。當時一般人士。對於此項成績。胥極驚佩之至。蓋該段路程。依照火車表規定。最快時間計需三小時零五分鐘也。</p>
<p>但新火車所創之新紀錄。曾不幾時。即已爲小奧斯汀所打破矣。蓋墨爾缽之奧斯汀經售商行主人狄卡遜氏。自得悉上項消息。遂即駕一雙人座運動式七馬力奧斯汀麟作班墨間之疾駛。及既安抵目的地後。核計所耗時間。　較新火車所創紀錄。尚少半小時。嗣後鐵路方面。以特快新車紀錄。不旋踵即爲小奧斯汀所突破覺。心有未甘。爰特於數小時後。再度開行。以冀重創最高新紀錄。但結果雖較其第一次所創紀錄的快十分鐘。然與小奧斯汀較。則仍大有遜色。蓋奧斯汀終以十九又二分之一分鐘佔先也。至其全程燃料耗費。計每一乘客爲一先令六辨士。若頭等火車費。則每客計須二十先令二辨士云。</p>

<h3>曼麗畢克馥所述影星登龍秘訣（上）</h3>
<p>— 米同</p>
<p>「如果你想在銀幕上顯身揚名，要是你没有中學畢業的程度，要是没有時髦的衣裝，要是你没有支持半年的經濟力量，要是你没有清脆人耳的喉音，和無限的耐苦能力，你最好不要到好萊塢去」以上是「美國甜心」，久負世界盛名的影后，曼麗璧克馥的指示。她的地位，她的權威，她的聲名和她的經騐，當然在她所説的話上，增加了不少力量。</p>
<p>「如果一個女子，不顧一切反對的勸告，立志要到這人浮於事的影城來一試身手，那她至少應當在事前，先有充份的籌備，愈長久愈好。就是在學校裏的時候，她應當先操練她的聲音和言語。一個組糙的喉音，最易使人生不快之感，並且是於她的前途，有莫大的障礙的。往往一個面目姣好的女子，因爲談話聲音不入耳而受了影響。一個柔軟而平穩的喉音，是容易使人生出好感嗎。」以上所説的話，並非老生常談。曼麗璧克馥直到現在，還是每星期要操練談話三次。以她的身份，還要如此做法，也可以知道一個人言談口齒的重要了。</p>
<p>觀察的藝術，是不可忽視的。在未出發到好萊塢之前，你應先操練你的記憶力，使之像一隻開末拉，入目不忘。因爲到了要背誦對白的時候，倘使你没有强健的記憶，或者臨時遺忘了，那是一件很危險的事。學校中的表演，是於登台的經騐，很有裨益的。常讀詩詞，背誦名人演説，亦是練習自己的良方。當然，戲劇的經騐，在學校中所得到的，可以使你日後得到無限的帮助，所以在學校裏有表演的機會，萬萬不可羞澀畏葸。</p>
<p>「跳舞可以矯正你的姿態，使你的動作合乎音節，使你在大衆面前行走的時候，態度從容大方。所以，在舞蹈的任何形態，你都應當學習而嫻熟。舞蹈的學問，在明星的歷程上，是不可或缺的條件。當然，你亦應當曉得些游泳和騎馬的技術。但是，這兩種技術，雖然也是很重要而最好懂得些，總不如跳舞的重要。因爲游泳騎馬，可以用替工，但是跳舞是於個人的體態有莫大裨益，而不能叫人替代的」</p>
<p>「至於衣裝方面，一個初到好萊塢的女子，衣箱中至少要有晚服兩襲，和常服無數套。其實，一個女子的衣服，愈多愈好。如果你的經濟力量不够，不能置備許多衣服，你最好不要到好萊塢去。」「不要到好萊塢去」那是曼麗壁克馥所一再聲明的。好萊塢的地面上，已經站滿了一錢不名的候補電影明星。她們愁着第二頓飯没有吃處，那裏還有錢來置備衣服呢？</p>
<p>「當一個女子，初到好萊塢的時候，不要住在飯店或公寓裏。她應當住在私人家庭之中。私人家庭之中，非但費用經濟，並且環境亦舒適些。最好那家庭之中有年輕的人，可以交接交接。好萊塢是個很寂寞的地方，要是你缺少朋友的話，如果同寓之中有年輕的男女，他們可以帮助你銷磨枯寂的時光，並且可以帶你去和外面交際交際，往往在這些交際之中，會碰見機會的。當然，交際是有一定的限制，而不可濫交的。</p>
<p>「如果你到了好萊塢，在第一二個星期之中，尋不到相當的事，你切不可灰心。你一定要咬定牙根，不變初衷。你應常照舊每天在各大公司跑一趟，不管有事無事。你或者白跑了幾個月，一些結果没有，但是可能性是永遠存在的或者明天就會遇到機緣的。即以我自己而論，我在初入影界的時候，老别奧格拉夫公司，將我的名字剔除了四次。到了第五次，他們才給我上鏡頭的機會——但是在那個時候，好萊塢還是地廣人稀的地方。現在的情形更不同了。所以，如果你是易於失望的話，還是不要到好萊塢的爲妙。」（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「奪夫妙計」</h3>
<p>— 亞夫</p>
<p>南京映</p>
<p>We're　Rich　Again</p>
<p>有些影片是可以顧名思義的，譬如本片的譯名固不必説。而原名的「我們又發財了」，也同樣是説明作品的庸俗。</p>
<p>大凡老看電影的人，大概都知道星期二三換的新片，好的總是很少，而這一次的「奪夫妙計」，也就没有例外。</p>
<p>這一影片是以舞臺劇改編的，這或者使愛好文藝的人覺得興奮，可是結果却未能如願。這一影片無論是内容和形式，都没有較好的成績。首先就是故事的庸俗。我們簡直懷疑這一影片是没有主題的。假使有的話，那便是賣女救窮，到後來自然會得横財，突然暴富起來。—一個多末庸俗的觀念啊！</p>
<p>這裏有着不少人上塲，可是都是爲了不甚通順的故事的搆成，而不是爲增加劇的表現。事實上故事是無原則，無中心的，以一些偶合與巧遇，作爲引人發笑的資料，凑合起來，可是不幸得很，却是失掉了笑的效果的。</p>
<p>毫無疑義的，導演的手術平庸，更是使這一影片不能成功的原因。他除了在織接方面没有多少錯誤之外，對於劇中人個性的把握，許多塲合都是以物件來表示，（如新娘的讀書之類）。可是這是使我們如討厭那一對游泳男女一樣的厭惡的。奧利芙在這裏所担任的角色，幾乎是失了人性的。瑪琳妮遜也極不相宜劇中人的個性比較好的倒是寻承「晚宴」中飾主婦的碧琳蒲克（Bollie　Burke）的演技，乃是相當值得鑒賞的。</p>
<h3>「楊柳春風」中的偉大的音樂炫耀</h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>站在一個音樂的出發點説起來，「楊柳春風」（The　Gay　Divorcee）可以稱爲本季最有希望的出産品。</p>
<p>有五位被世人揚頌的名編曲家在這裏出現：「晚上與白天」（Night　and　Day）爲考爾苞特（Cole　Porter）所作：「勿使它煩惱你」（Don,t　Let　it　Bother　You）爲哥敦（Gordon）與蕾菲（Revel）合作：「新大陸」（The　Continetal）和「海底撈針」（Looking　for　a　Needle　ina　Haystack）係康康拉德（Con　Conrad）與赫白瑪紀遜（Herb　Magidson）全作：「諾克尼斯」（Knock　Kneez）係哥敦與蕾菲合作。</p>
<p>哥敦與蕾菲曾爲「Broadway　Through　a　Keyhole」「We're　Not　Dressing」「Here　Comes　the　Bride」以及許多銀幕上極負盛名的片子編作歌曲。</p>
<p>康拉德與瑪紀遜合編作了時下最盛行的影片「Yes　Sir　I　Love　Your　Daughter」中的曲子。康拉德獨立編作過「MemoryLane」「Marge」「Lonesomeand　Sorry」以及「Cha　mpagne　Waltz」等片中的歌曲。</p>
<p>非常令人滿意的是，五十位美麗的跳舞的少女，她們出現於RKO-Radio的音樂的詼諧片「楊柳春風」中。每一位少女不僅是嬌美和姿容端正的程度，是與跳舞時的姿式等相符合，並且在預先她還需經過一番嚴慎的體格考試。</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒的逸聞</h3>
<p>— 企相</p>
<p>小明星秀蘭鄧波兒誰看了都覺得可愛！現在我把一些關於她的瑣聞，寫在下面，也許喜歡知道的人很多吧。</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒是好萊塢明星中唯一的在合同上有睡眠時間規定的，别的童星只很定須有充分睡眠時間而已，但是秀蘭鄧波兒的合同上却規定每天至少得匪九小時。</p>
<p>秀蘭現在的希望是：長大後做個理髮匠，她對於理髮事業似乎有特殊的興趣，每天一有空暇時間，就去注視福斯公司理髮師愛琳培熊工作。她自己也拿她的洋囡囡做試騐品，替她梳着髮辮，當然，這只是小孩子的幻想，不久就要改變的，以前她的最高希望是做個賣菜婦，可是没有多時就更改了。</p>
<p>鄧波兒目下雖然還識不了多少字，可是她接到影迷寄來的信件，却比好萊塢任何明星要多些，現在平均每星期有四千封，（其中大部份都是小孩子們剛學會寫的信），所以現在秀蘭鄧波兒也聘用了一位書記替她答覆函件。</p>
<p>秀蘭現在好萊塢所住的就是從前麗琳哈蕙的房子，福斯公司爲了她，特地請了很多設計家重行佈置，一切都適合孩子們的心理，性情，很簡單，很幽雅的，牆上並畫着「米開鼠」「三小屠豬」等滑稽卡通。秀蘭現在演的新片「小情人」就是她住進這屋子後所攝的。</p>
<p>秀蘭的老搭傑姆士鄧現已從事寫作電影小説，書中以秀蘭鄧波兒爲主角，現實地描寫這可愛的小明星，等到該書脱版，影片攝竣，我們又可在銀幕上看見他倆的合作了。</p>
<h3>卓别麟眞開口嗎？</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>却利卓别麟，和銀幕相别了很久了。但是現在他正拍一張新片。據知道些内容的人説，那張片子將來一旦公映，可以打破以前一切的賣座紀錄。</p>
<p>那張新片，現在正在努力攝製一切均籠罩在神秘之氛圍之中。並且有人説，將來公映的時候，廣告的策略，將用「卓别麟開口！」數字。觀衆們受了好奇心的衝動，大家總要去看一看。但是，據知道内容的人所透出來的消息，卓别麟並不開口説話，或者至多説些單音的字眼，藉助表情之不足，不足以當作對白也。但是許多工人，却日夜工作，正在卓别麟塲上趕築一座有聲攝影塲。這件事已引起了不少人的注意。</p>
<p>再則説那張新片的名字，現在暫定爲（“The　Wai　”）（野孩子。）將來或許還要更改。大概六個月之後，該片即可完成。</p>
<p>電影小説</p>
<h3>民族呼聲（Bordertown）（五）</h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>强尼拉米立斯當天晚上，想做的一椿重要事情，就是要和却利路克開談判，向他要求贏餘的四分之一。他知道那是一定可以辦得到的，因爲他知道却利路克是離不開他的。但是他以後却不須時時和曼麗路克見面了，因爲却利每天晚上，將一天的收入帶到家裏，藏在一個壁櫃裏，等到第二天銀行開了，然後再交進銀行。等到却利後來有事出門之後，强尼就代行職務，每天晚上要到路克家裏走一趟。</p>
<p>路克家的客室，光綫是暗暗的，祇有一盞脚燈，在沙發的後面發出一些柔軟的光綫出來。那天强尼走到路克家裏，曼麗事先已經坐在沙發裏等着他，從柔軟的燈光之中，看出曼麗體態的輪廓。曼麗看見强尼進來，就發出柔媚的聲音説道：「我知道却利會呌你每天晚上送錢到家裏來的，所以我没有跟他出門去。」</p>
<p>强尼一言不發，徐徐走向壁櫃。一回兒脚燈熄滅了，室中黑暗如漆，祇有晞微的晨光，從窗帘之下的縫中跳躍着。就在這幽暗之中，强尼聽見曼麗喘息的聲音，喊着他的名字。忽然間室中又大放光明起來，因爲强尼已經摸到了電燈的開關了。他對着曼麗道：「喂，你聽明白了。我跟你没有什麽過不去，我們儘管親近親近。但是………却利………我們是同道………交情不錯。我要是和他的女人來往，我算個什麽人呢？璀個人默然無言着，强尼慢慢將錢放進了壁櫃。過了一回，曼麗説道：「將來總有一天的，你看吧。」强尼亦没有説什麽話就走了，剩着曼麗一個人，自己冷笑了一下。</p>
<p>俗語説得好，打死一隻貓，方法很多。譬如説，一個大胖子，酒喝得爛醉如泥，由一個厭煩他的女人開着車送回家。她將軍子一直開進了車房，推推他，他却不醒。她看着他那種臃腫不靈的形狀，心中未免懊喪。忽然他陡然計上心頭。她咬緊了牙，决定丁。她悄悄離開了車，汽車没有關，汽油仍舊燃燒着。她輕輕將車房的的門關好了，獨自一個人進屋子去了。</p>
<p>明天早晨，曼麗路克痛哭流涕，對着警察陳述一切的經過。她説：「路克先生坐在車廂後面。他喝酒喝得爛醉的。他人又那麽肥。當然我没有氣力可以捉他出來。再則，他常常是那樣的。他常常喝醉的。不過以前，他常常自己醒了，自己下了車，自己走進屋子來。誰知道這次……」説到這裏，她已經泣不成聲了。那位警官聽完了，未免代她扼腕，這樣年輕美貌的女子，竟變成了一個伶仃無告的寡婦，於是勸着她道：「好了。人已經死啦。你白白悲傷，亦没有用啦。再説這個案情，是很顯明白，他是中了汽油的炭氧氣的毒而窒死的。抱歉得很，我爲法律的緣故，不得不詢問你，請你不用悲慟了。」</p>
<p>曼麗即此成了寡婦，自由的寡婦。但是，爲什麽她要自由？她和强尼現在成了合夥的股東了。但是出乎曼麗意科之外的，自從却利路克死了之後，强尼更加對她疏遠了。有的時候，曼麗求來的時候，他就將她送回家去，但是他送她到家門口就算了。他從來没有陪她進去過。她使他厭倦了。任她請求，他一概不理。她的態度，他假裝不懂得。他比以前更堅决了，不願意和她混在一起。他還有更重要的事在他腦筋裏呢。（未完）</p>

<p>Chiang Addresses the People of Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>[Nanchang] Chairman Chiang's address to the people of Jiangxi Province during the Nanchang New Life Movement commemoration is as follows: Today marks the first anniversary of the New Life Movement, and this commemoration conference is being held in Nanchang, the birthplace of the New Life Movement. I, Zhongzheng, feel compelled to express a few words to the comrades and compatriots of Jiangxi. For six years, the Red bandits occupied the southeast, ravaging the provinces of Jiangxi and Fujian. My fellow Jiangxi elders, brothers, and sisters, regardless of gender or age, or their relatives and friends, directly or indirectly, have been devastated, coerced, killed, raped, and violated by the Red bandits. The numbers are certainly over a million. The people in the bandit areas had no happiness in life, and the country was in turmoil. All the cultural virtues, propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, as well as the four cardinal principles and eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace of our nation, were destroyed without a trace by the bestial acts of the Red bandits. It was nearly the end of our people from not descending into the animal kingdom. Looking back at the raging flames and dark clouds at the time, the disaster was worse than floods and raging fires. The brilliant and solemn cultural history of the Chinese nation for five thousand years was almost completely wiped out. My Jiangxi compatriots, after enduring pain and reflecting on it, should never forget this kind of miserable and dangerous situation of displacement and should remember it in our hearts and minds, making it a painful history that our descendants should never forget. Now that the Red bandits have been eliminated, our compatriots can see the light of day again. Our actions and thoughts have returned to our original state, our lives are guaranteed, and we can finally obtain happiness in life, leading to today's joyful and celebratory day commemorating the New Life Movement. My comrades, we must know that this kind of spiritually joyful day of commemoration is created by the pain, endurance, and unwillingness to give up on difficulty and danger that the people of Jiangxi have experienced for the past six years, with unity from top to bottom, military-civilian cooperation, and the sacrifice of countless lives and property. In short, it is created by the strength of the Jiangxi compatriots' own struggle and the price paid by the efforts and cooperation of the people of the entire nation. Where does this kind of strength and price come from? It comes from the belief that my Jiangxi military and civilians, as well as comrades from all party and government circles, have consistently fulfilled the New Life Movement today. Our nation has this New Life Movement, and our country can establish a foundation for a new life. Only by using this new life as a foundation can we fight bitterly against the animalistic actions and treasonous thoughts of the Red bandits. In less than a year, we completely destroyed and recovered their deeply rooted nests, namely the base of the Red bandits in southern Jiangxi. From this, we can see the value of the New Life Movement, and especially see that the strength of the spirit of the New Life Movement, which originates from propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, can not only eliminate beasts and wipe out traitors, but also overcome any dangerous and difficult environment, leading to a thorough breakthrough to a broad and bright path. This also proves that these four cardinal principles are the only treasure for our nation to create a country, establish a society, revive the nation, and develop the people's livelihood. In short, after the fundamental extermination of the Red bandits this time, the past struggles of the communists, their plundering, tyrannical, and cruel materialistic view of history, cannot defeat the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, which is based on loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace. And the New Life Movement of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame is especially sufficient to eliminate all bestial evil deeds and overcome all dangerous environments. All can be made clear with a simplified explanation. Thus, it is known that the result of this bandit suppression is the final decisive battle and the only evidence that the Three Principles of the People have defeated communism. Nanchang is the birthplace of the New Life Movement, and it should not only be a model area for the New Life Movement, but all my Nanchang compatriots should be the backbone of the New Life Movement. In accordance with the spirit and meaning of the New Life Movement labor service corps promoted today, we must earnestly practice it. We must know that life is only based on labor and aimed at service. We must also base labor on the concept of serving society, so as not to be dominated by the selfish and self-serving individualism of the past, but to strive and inspire for our country, society, and suffering compatriots, so as to sweep away our nation's past bad habits of laziness and save our country from today's crisis, and then obtain the true meaning of life. I hope that comrades and compatriots from all walks of life in Jiangxi will be consistent in this goal, whether it is themselves or their relatives and friends, whether it is schools or various organizations, all should treat themselves as an individual, and several people as a group, agreeing with each other, encouraging each other, helping each other, cooperating, being sincerely united, working for the New Life Movement at all times, and serving the New Life Movement everywhere. By setting an example and working hard to promote it, the New Life Movement can be thoroughly effective, and the Red bandits, who are animalistic in nature, can be fundamentally eradicated, with no possibility of resurgence. The realization of our Three Principles of the People and the foundation of the revival of the Chinese nation are all tied to this. I, Zhongzheng, am about to leave Jiangxi on a western expedition. My attachment to my Jiangxi compatriots is beyond words. I only have these parting words to give, hoping that we will work together to maintain this hard-won and easily lost achievement of suppressing bandits and quelling chaos, and continue to struggle without slackening or changing, so as to lay the foundation for this revival of the nation and the completion of the revolution. I have great hope for this, and I shout: Long Live the Jiangxi Compatriots, Long Live the Republic of China, Long Live the Three Principles of the People. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Luan County Under Martial Law, Entry and Exit Blocked</p>
<p>Liu Zuozhou's Troops Guarding City Gates</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Immediately Rushed to Handle</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Hebei Provincial Government received a report from the Magistrate of Luan County that the conflict between the local militia and troops was due to Liu Zuozhou's unauthorized seizure of the local militia's command authority, placing them under his command and dividing the county's militia into nine districts. Each five households were to contribute one man-day's worth of wages per month, which was ineffective against popular resistance. Gao, the head of the Third District militia, protested against Liu's actions and contested the issue, leading to fighting on the 15th over the surrender of the militia's firearms to Liu's troops. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The conflict between the Luan County militia and security forces on the night of the 18th ended on the morning of the 19th. Hundreds were killed and wounded on both sides.

Luan County Magistrate Chen Cengshi and local gentry rushed to the front line on the 18th, mediating amidst the rain of bullets. Neither side was willing to give up. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The fierce fighting between the local militia and troops in Ben City on the night of the 18th resulted in extremely heavy casualties on both sides. It has been confirmed that the militia suffered over 40 dead and wounded, while the troops suffered over 60.

Tao Shangming plans to rush back to Tangshan on the 20th to handle the matter. On the 19th, he first telegraphed Lin Zhiming, secretary of the Commissioner's Office, and Wu You, a senator, to rush to Ben City to assist County Magistrate Chen in mediation. On the 18th, Tangshan was placed under martial law, with Zhao Lei's Second Regiment of Security Forces patrolling the outskirts to prevent retreating soldiers from entering. The militias of Fengrun, Qian'an, and Zunhua counties have all gathered on the border to guard and take a monitoring attitude towards the Luan County dispute.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Encouraging Silver Imports and Intensifying the National Products Movement</h3>
<p>Since the United States implemented its silver purchase policy, silver has been flowing out of our country, causing financial exhaustion and industrial and commercial difficulties. However, since the Ministry of Finance resolutely implemented the collection of silver export taxes on October 15th of last year, the outflow of silver has gradually decreased. However, due to the excessive outflow in the past, the market still feels the pain of illiquidity. Therefore, the need to encourage silver imports has become increasingly urgent. Now, the Ministry of Finance, in response to the requests of domestic industrial and commercial circles, has formulated measures to allow silver from abroad to be freely imported. After this, the amount of silver reserves in the country will inevitably gain another layer of security.</p>
<p>However, using tariff methods to regulate the inflow and outflow of silver is ultimately a temporary emergency measure and not a fundamental solution. Our country's international trade has a trade deficit every year, so it is always in a position of inverse adjustment in terms of international balance of payments. In the past, remittances from overseas Chinese and the surplus in the Northeast compensated for this. Therefore, there was no need to export silver. However, since the September 18th Incident, the situation has changed drastically. The Northeast is no longer ours, and overseas Chinese remittances have also decreased significantly in recent years. Therefore, this trade deficit in international trade must be paid for with silver. Therefore, the outflow of silver last year was partly the result of the United States raising silver prices, but it may also have been influenced by the international trade deficit. If this deficit phenomenon is not improved one day, and there are no other compensations to supplement it, then for the sake of paying the difference in international trade, silver will eventually flow out. Therefore, when speaking of a fundamental solution today, it must start with curbing the trade deficit.</p>
<p>Since the opening of trade, our country's handicrafts have gradually been eliminated, and almost all daily necessities of the people rely on imported goods. In foreign trade, we only have raw materials and agricultural products. Exchanging large quantities of cheap raw materials for high-quality and expensive manufactured goods will inevitably result in a trade deficit. The reason why our country has had a trade deficit every year since the beginning of international trade lies in this. The solution must be to develop national industries. The way to develop national industries is to vigorously implement protective tariffs. This is recognized by economists today. Although our country's tariffs are now autonomous, vigorously implementing protective tariffs will inevitably lead to diplomatic disputes. This is a major reason why it is difficult to develop our country's national industries. The difficulty in implementing trade controls also lies in this kind of factual difficulty.</p>
<p>Therefore, in today's international environment, the only way to seek the development of our country's national industries is the national products movement. Our country's national products movement has been gradually renewed in recent years through various promotions. In the past, merchants often flaunted imported goods to customers, but now they mostly promote national products. This change in the atmosphere is evident here. However, it seems that a great deal of effort is still needed to replace foreign goods. First, the awakening of patriotism must be a continuous movement. Second, the authenticity of national products must be determined. Today's markets are full of cases where imported goods are disguised as national products. The customer is unable to distinguish which is a national product and which is an imported product in nine out of ten cases. If this phenomenon of mixing the fake with the real is not corrected as soon as possible, it will be a major harm to the future of the national products movement. We believe that national product manufacturers should pay attention to this point. If they can cultivate the public's ability to distinguish national products in various ways, it will greatly benefit the promotion of national products. In short, developing today's national industries by seeking protective tariffs and trade controls may be difficult to achieve temporarily. What we can do at present is to promote national products to the extent possible. If national products are increasingly promoted, the outflow of silver can be gradually reduced, and the pain of financial exhaustion and industrial and commercial decline can also be reduced accordingly.</p>

<h3>Announcement of the U.S. Gold Clause Case Ruling</h3>
<p>The government completely wins the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The gold clause does not apply to private bonds.</p>
<p>National debts must still be repaid in cash.</p>
<p>[Washington] The U.S. Supreme Court recently announced its ruling on the constitutional gold clause, ruling that the gold clause in the Constitution should be abolished for private debt contracts, but that national debts and loans should still be repaid by the government in gold. When the judgment was read, the court audience was extremely crowded. Senior government representatives and members of Congress personally attended the event, but all the doors of the court were tightly closed to prevent the crowds outside from rushing in to await the news. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The U.S. Supreme Court has today announced its ruling on the "gold payment clause" test case. The ruling largely supports the "New Deal's" policy of malpractices. The court fully supports the congressional resolution to abolish the gold payment clause in all private bonds. Although it claimed that Congress exceeded its authority with regard to government bonds, it denied the people the right to sue the government. When the Treasury Department reclaims gold certificates, the people may not demand that the government pay back one dollar and sixty-nine cents for each dollar due to the reduced value of the current currency. Because the amount involved was too large, the court reversed its usual practice and read the main text first, and then stated the reasons. The court believes that the U.S. "Compensation Court" has no right to deal with cases related to government bonds. Although the congressional resolution to abolish the gold payment clause is an act of exceeding authority, any change must be carried out in accordance with the law, and is not something that the "Compensation Court" can handle. Therefore, this ruling by the Supreme Court has made it impossible for holders of government bonds and gold certificates to file lawsuits again. Treasury officials said that this was a complete victory for the government. The court, having denied the people the right to sue the government, also does not need to rule on whether holders of government bonds should receive one dollar and sixty-nine cents of the current currency to offset the old malpractice of one dollar, and whether the congressional resolution to abolish the gold payment clause is legal. Some aspects of the Supreme Court's ruling are very peculiar, so the situation in the court was very chaotic when it was read. The opinions of the nine judges were five to four. Chief Justice Hughes and others held the majority opinion, while Reynolds and others were on the opposition side. The front of the court was very crowded this morning, waiting for the reading of the judgment. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>The main points of the ruling include two points.</p>
<p>[Washington] The Supreme Court's ruling on the gold clause case has now been released. Although on the surface it is detrimental to government bonds, it can actually be regarded as a complete victory for the government. The main points of the ruling are: (1) It recognizes the government's claim that the gold clause does not apply to private bonds; (2) It denies the government's claim that government bonds do not need to be repaid in gold. In other words, the Supreme Court upholds the government's right to cancel the gold clause in private bonds, but rules that the congressional resolution stipulating that government debts can be repaid in U.S. dollars is invalid. The Supreme Court believes that such bonds must be repaid in gold or in the equivalent value of the currently devalued currency. At the same time, the Supreme Court denies those who hold previous gold certificates the right to seek relief from the "Compensation Court." (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Bondholders can no longer sue</p>
<p>Those who hold previous gold certificates have recently requested that the gold certificate dollars be repaid at one dollar and sixty-nine cents of the currently devalued currency. Therefore, this ruling by the Supreme Court will prevent bondholders from recovering their assets according to the old gold standard. Although the Supreme Court ruled that the government must repay bonds in gold or the equivalent value of the devalued currency, this effect has been completely eliminated because the Supreme Court does not allow people to seek relief in this regard. Therefore, although the government has failed technically and legally, it is in fact victorious.</p>
<p>The door to compensation for losses is closed.</p>
<p>In terms of the effect of the government bond ruling, for every one thousand dollar gold certificate held, the government must repay one thousand six hundred and ninety dollars in U.S. dollars according to today's value. However, the court also ruled that bondholders cannot sue the government for compensation, so the door to compensation for losses has been closed. Support for the government's monetary policy</p>
<p>The court also ruled that the government's act of devaluing the U.S. dollar was unconstitutional, but at the same time claimed that bondholders did not suffer any losses as a result of this act, because the government's move was merely exercising the power of Congress to regulate the national currency. According to this ruling, repayment should be made in full without any additional payment. In practical terms, the Supreme Court's ruling supports Congress's right to handle monetary matters and recognizes that the court must take into account the current economic situation when adjudicating contract cases.</p>
<p>Five of the nine judges agree.</p>
<p>The above ruling is the opinion of the majority of judges. Of the nine Supreme Court judges, five agreed, so they constituted a majority. The minority judges, represented by McLennos, stated their opinions and severely criticized the majority judges, saying that the Constitution was gone. The majority judges, on the one hand, declared that Congress did not have the right to deny gold certificate debts, and on the other hand, ruled that bondholders could not receive gold and must receive legal currency worth six dimes to replace the gold dollar that the government had previously agreed to pay.</p>
<p>All profits from devaluation go to the national treasury.</p>
<p>According to this ruling, Congress has no right to deny its gold obligation in its bonds, but it can avoid paying the gold price that should be paid with the devalued currency. It should be noted that the government has made a profit of 2.8 billion yuan from devaluing the currency. All of this money is stored in the national treasury.</p>
<p>Conscience-based judgment is admirable in its courage.</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Times stated that although the gold clause case ruling was not supported by the majority of judges, it can be regarded as a conscience-based judgment by those with independence and public spirit. Its reprimand of the government for failing to fulfill its obligations is especially commendable for its courage. Therefore, although the actual impact of this ruling may not be far-reaching, its moral impact is by no means insignificant. Hereafter, those in power will understand that the Supreme Court will not support them and will not dare to act lightly on the nation's honor. The American people were initially ashamed to hear that the government intended to deny its solemn debt. Now the court has used this to resolve this shame and declare such an action to be immoral and illegal. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Government authorities are very pleased.</p>
<p>After the court's ruling was announced, President Roosevelt received a phone report, but did not express his opinion at the time. Attorney General Cummings, who represented the government in court, expressed satisfaction with the ruling. House Speaker Dolton stated that the court's ruling believes that what the government has done is not absolutely legal, but it is still reasonable. Sumner, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, stated that there are no difficulties now. The major difficulties with private bonds have now been resolved. As for government bonds, we can legislate to deal with them without paying a penny more. It is reported that government bonds with gold clauses are worth about 4.81 billion yuan, while private bonds are worth about 5.19 billion yuan. Members of Congress and the government who support President Roosevelt were very pleased to hear this ruling. The White House has acknowledged that this is a great victory for the government. Officials believe that with this ruling, the government does not need to propose a large-scale financial plan. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Silver faction members will become more active.</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt only said "I am very pleased" about the Supreme Court's ruling on the gold case. At the same time, government leaders such as Senator Robinson and Attorney General Cummings stated that this ruling has made it unnecessary for Congress to find other ways to remedy the situation. Robinson said that this was a complete victory for the government. Senator Pittman, a member of the silver faction in the Senate, congratulated the Supreme Court for taking this decisive action, saying that Congress now has full power to control the U.S. monetary system. It is said that members of the silver faction in Congress will become more active as a result of this ruling. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Wall Street expresses satisfaction.</p>
<p>[New York] Financial and business people are unanimously satisfied with the Supreme Court's ruling. Wall Street believes that this ruling is constructive and will make the government more confident in its credit expansion, rather than currency inflation to encourage private industries. It is expected that the government will no longer need to continue to adopt financial plans. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Market sees a general surge.</p>
<p>[New York] After the Supreme Court's ruling on the gold clause case, which was favorable to the government, the clouds of doubt that had permeated the U.S. markets in the past month disappeared. Prices of securities and goods rose today, because everyone saw this ruling as extremely beneficial to the bulls. As soon as the ruling was announced, buy orders poured into Wall Street, causing the prices of securities to rise, especially railroad stocks. Many markets felt the backlash very strongly. The Chicago Exchange was the first to suspend trading. Its wheat market suspended trading at 12:15 p.m. to avoid excessive speculation. Although the general market situation rose, with securities rising from one to four dollars, many businessmen also took profits, which reduced the initial rise. New York cotton futures closed up 11 to 19 points, because it is expected that textiles and raw cotton will become more active as a result of this ruling. Foreign currencies also strengthened, and the U.S. dollar loosened. Most importers in the raw silk market were unwilling to quote prices and wanted to determine the transaction after the impact of the gold clause case ruling became clear, but the market price rose by three dimes. The sugar market closed up one or two points. Sugar prices rose in the morning due to local speculative buying, but the impact of the ruling prevented the surge because retail investors took profits. The Chicago Board of Trade announced tonight that the wheat market will operate as usual tomorrow. It was temporarily suspended today due to the chaotic market. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Ottawa The financial community here is very satisfied with the U.S. gold clause case ruling. With the general doubts eliminated, the Canadian stock market trended upward. Industrial stocks and gold mining stocks all jumped in price, but there were also those that rose first and then fell due to speculative profit-taking. However, on the whole, the surge today was quite common. The Winnipeg wheat market was affected by the Chicago wheat market and rose by 1.25 points, but the closing price was only 2 points higher than yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Caused fluctuations in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>[London] The U.S. Supreme Court's gold clause ruling will cause changes in the foreign exchange market. European countries that previously sold francs to buy U.S. dollars and then bought British pounds will now reverse their previous situation. Speculators are now eager to cover their positions, so the price of francs against the U.S. dollar rose sharply this morning, and the British pound also fell with the U.S. dollar. According to informed sources, this trend will continue for some time, and the price of gold will gradually rise. The strong trading of gold-plated stocks today is due to this reason. However, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling failed to increase the export of U.S. cotton by one package, nor did it clear the haze of pepper and other items, and solve the rubber problem produced by the natives of the Dutch East Indies. The drought in the wheat belt of the western suburbs of the United States and the shortage of forage and meat supply in the United States cannot benefit from the gold clause ruling. However, according to the current market sentiment, speculators tend to buy, which is why the prices of various items have soared today. (Trans-telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>Comments from British and French newspapers</p>
<p>[Paris] The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the gold clause case is highly valued by the newspapers here. The Daily News stated, "The abolition of the gold clause is an inevitable result of the currency depreciation policy. If the gold clause is restored, the U.S. monetary policy will become a problem. Is it possible for the U.S. government and Congress, if they cannot appeal to the Supreme Court, to use the means of amending the Constitution to avoid this major change? Now that the Supreme Court has made a ruling that is favorable to the government, there is no need to propose a discussion on the issue of amending the Constitution." The Paris Echo acknowledges President Roosevelt's victory, but said, "This ruling does not seem to be enough to strengthen the world's respect for contracts, because most creditors have lost the case, and the sacred promises made by debtors are no longer valued." The Order newspaper headlined with the words "Gold Clause" and said, "The U.S. government has won a great victory in this case. The loser is none other than those who rely on the U.S. Constitution." (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>[London] The most important news in the British newspapers today is the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the gold clause case. Although the newspapers' criticisms are not entirely satisfactory, they all acknowledge that this is a victory for President Roosevelt and the U.S. dollar. The Financial Times and others said that the greatest benefit of this ruling to the public is the guarantee of stability. The Daily Telegraph stated that the Supreme Court's announcement is tantamount to saying that the cancellation of the gold clause is illegal, but it is effective. Business people regret that the Supreme Court did not uphold the sanctity of contracts. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>The Japanese financial community is watching.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese financial community is paying attention to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the U.S. gold clause issue. According to the observations of the Ministry of Finance and the general financial community, regardless of whether the ruling is favorable to the government, it will not have a direct impact on the Japanese financial community. However, the motive for the problem arose from the activity of speculators, so even with President Roosevelt's efforts, if the New York financial community falls into chaos, the Japanese financial community will inevitably be affected. Therefore, it is paying close attention to the indirect impact in this sense. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Each electric power company that has foreign debts is relieved because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the gold clause for private debts is invalid. The five major electric power companies in Japan, except for those that own all of the debt, still have U.S. dollar debts of US$87 million that have not been repaid. If the gold clause is ruled to be effective, the burden will increase by 1.69 times. (Dentsu dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Aviation Plan</h3>
<p>Opening up seven major air routes</p>
<p>Costing 200 million yuan</p>
<p>Military and political reforms to wait two to three years</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The expansion of aviation by the great powers in the Far East has quite stimulated the Japanese aviation industry. Yesterday, Baron Asada specifically chose this issue to question the Minister of Communications, Tokutsumi, at the Budget Committee of the House of Peers. The Minister of Communications' reply to this attracted much attention. The content is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The minimum cost of the contents to compete with the aviation of other countries for Japan civil aviation is 200 million yen, and the source of funds is currently being researched by the government, or whether certain expenditures will be made from the special communications account, it is also unknown.</p>
<p>The contents of the 200 million yen plan said by the Minister of Communications, Tokutsumi, are as follows: (1) Tokyo-Dalian route, (2) Tokyo-Sendai-Aomori-Sapporo-Sakhalin, (3) Hokkaido-Nemuro-Kamchatka, (4) Fukuoka-Taiwan route extended to Okinawa, (5) Osaka-Matsue-North Korea route, (6) Tokyo-Hachijojima-Ogasawara-South Pacific route, (7) Tokyo-Osaka as the center to various prefectures, (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] On the 18th, Baron Asada questioned Minister of the Army Hayashi at the Budget Committee of the House of Peers,</p>
<p>Is it necessary for the Army to reform military administration in the future?</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi replied to this,</p>
<p>Considerable reforms should be implemented, but because the research has not been completed, it is not convenient to specify the implementation period.</p>
<p>The Army authorities also issued the following opinion,</p>
<p>The issue of military administration reform has been studied since the time of Minister of the Army Ugaki. During the time of Minister of the Army Minami, when the specific plan was decided to be submitted to the Military Council, the Manchurian Incident suddenly occurred, so the implementation was temporarily suspended. However, due to the Manchurian Incident, the international situation has completely changed. Japan and "Manchukuo" bear the responsibility of joint defense, so it is now considering improving the garrison in Manchuria and determining the permanent or alternate system of the garrison. At the same time, a major reform of the entire Army will be implemented. The time will be two or three years later. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Construction of an undersea tunnel between Shimonoseki and Moji</h3>
<p>To facilitate military transportation</p>
<p>The project requires 10 million gold</p>
<p>Construction to begin next year and be completed in five years</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the Kanmon link issue, Minister of Railways Uchida listened to the intentions of the Army and Navy. Because he received a reply that bridges were absolutely impossible from the perspective of national defense, the Railway Ministry, on its own initiative, avoided the Kanmon, where construction was difficult, and decided to start construction on the undersea tunnel planned line between Shimonoseki and Kokura. On the 18th, he ordered the director of the Kurokawachi Works Bureau to establish a concrete construction plan. The construction cost is 10 million yen. Construction will begin in the 11th year of Showa (1936) and can be opened to traffic by the 16th year of Showa (1941) at the latest. Once this undersea tunnel is realized, it will not only be more convenient for national defense, but also for transportation in northern Kyushu. Therefore, all parties have high expectations for this. (Dentsu dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Hirota's proposal to Russia</h3>
<p>Using the Treaty of Portsmouth for peace</p>
<p>Establish a demilitarized zone on the border</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When Foreign Minister Hirota met with the Russian envoy yesterday afternoon, he proposed concluding a concrete agreement to maintain peace between Japan and Russia. It is said that the content of his proposal is as follows: (1) Use the Treaty of Portsmouth to maintain peaceful relations between Japan and Russia; (2) Imitating the current situation on the Japan-Russia border in Sakhalin, establish a Japan-Puppet-Russia border committee on the border between North Manchuria and Russia to resolve past and future border disputes; (3) Establish a demilitarized zone on the border, that is, the Japanese and Russian troops will withdraw their garrisons from important areas on the border line. The Russian envoy only expressed his approval of his intention, but also asked Foreign Minister Hirota's opinion on the non-aggression treaty proposed by the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Hirota did not give a clear answer, and agreed to reconsider it and meet again another day. (Hua Lian dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Italy's afforestation achievements</h3>
<p>Report from the Commander-in-Chief of the Forestry Militia</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Pan-Italian Forestry Militia today and listened to the work of the Forestry Militia in 1934. According to the Commander-in-Chief's report, the new afforestation area last year was 12,774 hectares (each hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters). In addition, 5,818 hectares have been specially treated. Last year, a total of 386,000 cubic meters of walls were built to prevent mountain floods and soil erosion. A total of 1,000 kilometers of forest roads have been built. A total of 486 houses were constructed at a construction cost of 46 million lire, most of which were wages for workers. Regarding afforestation, the militia used a total of 60 million seedlings and 600,000 kilograms of seeds, all of which were planted within the militia's forest farms. Mountain pastures have also been improved. The militia used 3 million lire as the government's compensation to landowners for land reclamation. Under the supervision of the militia, an average of 14,000 workers were employed every day throughout the year. Mussolini was very satisfied with the achievements of the Forestry Militia.

<h3>Problem of Crackdown on Arms Production and Sales Discussed in Geneva US Proposal</h3>
<p>Second subcommittee on disarmament passes three principles</p>
<p>British Royal Commission of Inquiry established</p>
<p>[Geneva] The U.S. government submitted a draft convention on the suppression of arms manufacturing and sales at the Disarmament Conference last year. It believed that since it was currently impossible to establish a general disarmament convention, a convention with limited scope should be signed first. The draft submitted by the United States was discussed by two special committees established by the Disarmament Conference. One was the "International Committee for the Suppression of Arms Manufacturing and Sales" and the other was the "Committee for Studying General Clauses of the Disarmament Conference." Both committees met here on the 14th of this month. The main issues studied by the Second Committee are two: one is the issue of the Standing Disarmament Committee, and the other is the issue of arms supervision. Regarding the former, the committee has recently passed three clauses in the U.S. draft, namely:</p>
<p>(1) A Standing Disarmament Committee will be established in the International Union of Nations, composed of one representative from each signatory government. Each government may also send assistant staff and experts to assist the attending representatives; (2) The Standing Disarmament Committee may select from the above-mentioned experts to form a committee of experts to assist the committee in handling all matters; (3) The secretariat of the Standing Disarmament Committee will be taken over by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations;</p>
<p>As for the issue of arms supervision, it does not seem to have reached the stage of public discussion. It is expected that the United States and France and the United States and Britain will hold negotiations separately in the committee's lounge first. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>[London] Britain will now follow the U.S. practice to investigate private manufacturing of arms and this trade. The first step has been taken today. According to Prime Minister MacDonald's announcement in the Lower House, the Royal Commission of Inquiry has been established and will begin its work immediately. Its responsibilities are (1) to consider and report from the national and international observation points (a) whether it is feasible to prohibit the private manufacturing and trade of military uniforms and bullets by Britain alone (b) or by Britain in conjunction with other countries in the world, and to return it to the state for exclusive manufacturing and sale, and whether to issue this; (2) to consider and report on what methods can be used to eliminate or reduce the various objections to private manufacturing listed in Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant; (3) to study the existing British regulations on controlling the export trade of military uniforms and bullets, and report whether these regulations should be revised. If revisions are needed, in which direction should they be taken? It is reported that the committee has the power to summon witnesses, request written information, and request access to documents.

<h3>Regarding Germany's Reply and the Exchange of Opinions Between Britain and France</h3>
<p>After Discussions in Both Countries' Cabinets</p>
<p>A New Development in the Situation Begins</p>
<p>[London] The Anglo-French talks originally scheduled to take place after the German reply was received have now begun. Foreign Secretary Simon met with the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, today to discuss Germany's invitation to Britain for direct talks. The British government will respond to this. The start of these Anglo-German talks may involve Britain sending a representative to Germany or Germany sending a representative to Britain. If Britain sends a representative to Germany, the person in charge of this mission will be either Foreign Secretary Simon or Lord Privy Seal Eden. If Germany sends a representative to Britain, it will be German Foreign Minister Neurath. Everything is currently undecided and will be discussed at the British cabinet meeting this Wednesday. However, opposition within diplomatic circles to British cabinet members going to Germany remains very strong. (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The situation created by Germany's response to the Anglo-French proposals has not changed in the last two days. Although the French government has maintained close contact with the British government, no new developments will occur until the French Council of Ministers meets tomorrow and the British cabinet meeting the day after. The French government believes that hasty action is neither necessary nor beneficial. Since Britain fully understands its international responsibilities to France, the decisions taken by the British cabinet will certainly take them into account. France has complete confidence in this. The Council of Ministers meeting at the Presidential Palace tomorrow will primarily discuss Germany's reply. (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] Germany's reply regarding the Anglo-French proposals of February 3rd expressed acceptance of the Western European Air Pact plan. According to some sources, if Britain and France make Germany's acceptance of the London Accords and other parts (referring to Germany's return to the League of Nations, the conclusion of a general arms limitation treaty, the conclusion of a Danube River pact, and Eastern European mutual assistance pacts) a condition for signing the Air Pact, then Germany may retract its acceptance. Furthermore, Germany will not accept any restrictions on the strength of its land and air forces. If this is the case, separate Anglo-German talks would be of no benefit. Britain and France will certainly express their views on the points omitted in Germany's reply, but only after consulting with Germany. And before consulting with Germany, it is necessary for Britain and France to exchange opinions. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Foreign Minister Laval explained the diplomatic situation created by Germany's reply to the Anglo-French London proposals at the Council of Ministers, stating that the situation may not develop rapidly, but that close contact between Paris and London, with mutual cooperation and trust, will allow them to exchange opinions. He also said that the various pending issues must be carefully considered, so Britain and France should not hastily respond externally to Germany. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[London] Lord Privy Seal Eden made a statement in the House of Commons today regarding the Air Mutual Assistance Pact, saying, "I can now report to the House that the governments of Belgium, Germany and Italy have all replied separately to the invitations from the British and French governments, stating their views. The Belgian government, in its formal note sent to Britain on January 11th, stated that it was prepared to participate in negotiations to sign the Air Pact. The Italian government's letter of February 9th expressed support for the Air Pact in principle, but reserved the right to consider certain points, especially regarding the mutual responsibility between Britain and Italy. As for Germany, in its note of February 14th, it accepted the proposal of the Air Pact, expressed satisfaction, and was prepared to consult with other governments on suitable methods for signing the Air Pact," and so on.

<h3>Britain Efforts to Mediate the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute</h3>
<p>Italian Military Mobilization Considered Purely Defensive</p>
<p>Austrian Troop Increases Prevent Germany from Taking Advantage</p>
<p>[Paris] According to information obtained by the Havas correspondent in London, British Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons that the British Minister to Abyssinia, on behalf of the British government, has consistently tried to assist in achieving a friendly resolution of the misunderstandings between Italy and Abyssinia. Talks between Italy and Abyssinia have already begun in the Abyssinian capital between the Italian minister and the Abyssinian government. This news is quite consistent with the speculation of French officials, who believe that Italy's purpose is only to increase its defensive military strength in Italian Somaliland and Eritrea so that it can resist in the event of an attack by Abyssinia. Furthermore, Italy has no intention of launching a large-scale expedition at present to conquer East African territory. It is also rumored that the Italian government will mobilize two army corps to be stationed on the Italian-Austrian border, especially the Brenner Pass on the Italian-Austrian border, so that the German National Socialist Party will be wary and will not attempt to take action against Austria because the Italian army has gone to East Africa. (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Vienna The Vienna correspondent of the British Daily Telegraph published a message yesterday stating that three divisions of the German Bavarian army are being moved on the German-Austrian border, and Italy is also mobilizing two army corps at the Brenner Pass on the Italian-Austrian border. Responsible persons here have no knowledge of this news. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Italian-Abyssinian Negotiations Continue</h3>
<p>[Rome] Negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia are currently continuing in the Abyssinian capital. Abyssinia seems to have accepted the principle of establishing a neutral zone in the Walwal area, but with certain conditions, such as allowing nomadic peoples to use the wells within the neutral zone, as one of the conditions. Rome is said to have accepted this, but has rejected other conditions. What Italy hopes for most is to reach a compromise so that the Abyssinian army will immediately withdraw from the planned neutral zone. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Philippine Constitutional Draft</h3>
<p>Quezon to Take it to the United States</p>
<p>Prepared for President Roosevelt's Approval</p>
<p>[Manila] Senate President Quezon will lead a delegation of prominent Filipinos tomorrow, taking the new Philippine Constitution aboard the President Coolidge to the United States for approval by Washington. Other members of the delegation are former Philippine House Speaker Roxas and the current President of the Philippine Sugar Association, Alunan. The new constitution was drafted by the constitutional convention over a period of six months. It states that since the United States began governing the Philippines thirty-five years ago, the democratic politics and individual freedoms brought by Britain to the United States have deeply penetrated the minds of Filipinos. The preamble of the constitution contains the phrase "with the blessing of God," which is also a noteworthy fact, as the Philippines has had much contact with Western countries and is the only Christian country in the East. Spaniards came here to preach 400 years ago. The constitution of the Philippines is generally similar to that of the United States, but there are differences in style, political power, and work. The constitution stipulates the organization of a republican government, and, like the constitution of the United States, clearly defines the rights enjoyed by the people, and advocates the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers. The functions of the three powers are the same as in the United States, but one point differs from the ambitions of the United States, namely, that the Philippine parliament is a single organization, not divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives. The administrative head is a president, and a vice president. The constitution also stipulates that all men, if not illiterate, have the right to vote in elections, and if 300,000 women vote in favor of women's suffrage in a special vote, then women can enjoy rights. The constitution stipulates that only the people and companies of the Philippines can enjoy the right to purchase or lease public land and natural resources, and the same applies to private cultivated land, except for inherited property. The constitution restricts the public land that individuals or companies can purchase or lease, and authorizes Congress to restrict the private land that individuals or companies purchase and maintain. The constitution also stipulates the selection of a national language, but for the time being, both English and Spanish can be used. The constitution directly incorporates the various mandatory clauses of the Philippine independence bill. The constitution will soon be sent to President Roosevelt, and if the president considers it consistent with the independence bill, he will announce its acceptance, and then the bill will be sent to the Filipinos for a vote. After the constitution is approved, officials will be elected, at which time the President of the United States will announce the validity of the ten-year republic. According to some observers, the republican period will not begin before 1936 because the procedures are very complicated. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Hauptmann's Life in Death Row Hopes and Fears Intertwined</h3>
<p>Reading and Smoking to Pass the Time</p>
<p>German Immigrants Indignant and Raising Funds for Relief</p>
<p>Trenton Since Hauptmann, who was sentenced to death in the Lindbergh kidnapping case, was escorted to death row on Saturday night, he has been reading and smoking to pass the time, his heart filled with hope and fear. His lawyer is working on appeal matters, and his first step is to apply to New Jersey for relief to bear the expenses of transcribing the case records, as Hauptmann is a pauper. Hauptmann's mother is currently in Germany. In addition to writing to President Roosevelt to beg for clemency for her son, she also telegraphed the Governor of New Jersey to pardon her son's death sentence. The governor has replied today, saying that the case will be reviewed by the appellate court. Although the governor expresses deep sympathy, he currently has no power to pardon. The final body to handle the case will be the pardon court, which he will attend. He cannot express his opinion until then. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>[New York] Since Hauptmann, the Lindbergh baby kidnapper, has been sentenced to death, two organizations organized by German immigrants here, one called the German League and the other called the Hitler League, have protested the court's verdict and have begun raising funds to support the prisoner. In addition, they severely attacked Warren Wilentz, the prosecutor of the Flemington court, saying that he "used the Hauptmann case as a pretext and even made slanderous propaganda against the Germans."

<h3>German Aristocratic Woman Executed on the Guillotine for Espionage</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Today, the authorities issued a notice in red and black characters with the two large characters "Death Penalty" on it. Thereupon, the people of Berlin all knew that the two female spies, namely the former Baroness von Berge and Frau Natzmer, were about to be executed. The two women were convicted of conspiring to sell the German mobilization plan to a foreign country. This is the first time in Germany's peaceful times that someone has been executed for this crime. The execution was carried out today by professional executioners, dressed in evening wear and wearing white gloves, assisted by two assistants. The Baroness, wearing ordinary prison clothes, was the first to step onto the execution platform. With a single stroke of the steel axe, her head rolled into a basket full of rice bran. Her corpse was placed in a coffin and carried away. The Baroness used her original name, Frau Fölckersam, because she had divorced Baron von Berge two weeks prior. Frau Natzmer was also beheaded in the same way. According to semi-official sources, the two women were accused of attempting to steal the General Staff's hypothetical plan to invade Poland. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Execution by Axe Severely Criticized by British Newspapers</h3>
<p>Medieval Barbaric Acts</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Seen Again Today</p>
<p>[London] Two women in Berlin stole the German General Staff's plan to invade Poland and leaked it to a foreign country. The news of their execution has caused a bad impression here. Moreover, the fact that they were beheaded with an axe is seen as a recurrence of medieval barbaric acts. Germany's recent demands for unreserved equality in military equipment, combined with this barbaric act, make the impression even worse. The Manchester Guardian said, "The reason why espionage is punished by death is precisely because Germany lives in an atmosphere of class struggle and international war." The News Chronicle's criticism was even harsher, saying, "The German government was greatly alarmed when it saw that two women had leaked its conspiracy of aggression, so the court verdict was unusually barbaric. When Hitler expressed peaceful intentions towards Poland, the two women leaked the German plan to prepare to invade Poland to Poland. Hitler's anger can be imagined." (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Fireworks Launched by a Civilian Ship Cause Anxiety Among Hong Kong People</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Last night, the White Swan mail ship sent out a radio message stating that it had seen a rocket distress signal fired into the air. For a time, the people of Hong Kong were very anxious, believing that a ship must have encountered danger at sea or been robbed. According to the radio message, the location of the signal was about thirty miles from Hong Kong. Therefore, several British warships went to the address last night to search for it in order to provide assistance. After running around all night, they found nothing. Hong Kong also sent out several tugboats. Merchant ships at sea were asked to report news by radio. By dawn, the ship was still nowhere to be seen, so the British warship Diamond was sent to search near Dongsha Island. Three more police boats were sent out until 10:00 in the morning when a radio message was received from a warship stating that the truth had been found. It turned out that a civilian ship had launched fireworks at sea, causing this misunderstanding. The owner of the civilian ship has been reprimanded. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Wu Ruikun Arrested for Smuggling Gold Out of Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Xiamen] Wu Ruikun, a Taiwanese manager of the Jinbaohe Money Exchange, was arrested by the Japanese consulate on the 19th for smuggling gold out of Taiwan. Zhang Youjin, the vice president of the Taiwanese Association, avoided him. The price of gold in Taiwan, Xiamen, and Jinmen is 107 yuan, but the Japanese exchange rate is 28 yuan more per 100 yuan, so a lot of gold is smuggled to Xiamen. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Various Gansu Organizations Call for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>To the Shanghai Shenbao News Agency, and please forward to all domestic and foreign charitable organizations and philanthropists: Gansu is unfortunately suffering from frequent disasters. Since the severe drought in the 17th and 18th years, the vitality has been greatly damaged and the people's livelihood has been declining. Water, drought, wind, sand, hail, and other disasters have occurred one after another, without any year spared. Recently, such as the great flood in the entire province in the 22nd year, and the great drought in the entire province in the early summer of last year, and the hail and continuous rain in various places after autumn, the disaster areas are extremely vast and the losses are extremely heavy. The number of people fleeing is even countless. According to the investigation of the Provincial Relief Association, among the more than 60 counties in the province that were flooded in the 22nd year, there were actually Gaolan, Tianshui, Tongwei, Huanxian (Qingyang, Huixian, Huating, Qin'an, Gangu, Wushan, Weiyuan, Zhangxian, Qingshui, Yuzhong, Wudu, Lixian, Jingning, Lingtai, Chongxin, Minxian, Linxia, ​​Heishui, Longxi, Taosha, Kangle Provisional Administration Bureau, Zhenyuan, Xihe, Jingtai, Huaping, Linze, Ningding, Huining, Yongjing, Hezheng, Wuwei, Dingxi, Wenxian, Haiyuan, Zhengning, Gulang, Minqin, Jingyuan, Lintao, Guyuan, Zhuanglang, Yongdeng, Pingliang, etc. Forty-seven counties. Those who suffered from drought, hail, and continuous rain last year also reached Weiyuan, Lintao, Gaolan, Zhangxian, Lixian, Longde, Jingtai, Taosha, Wudu, Tongwei, Huating, Zhuanglang, Pingliang, Wuwei, Minqin, Yongchang, Longxi, Jiuquan, Qingshui, Lintan, Jingyuan, Yongdeng, Jingchuan, Linxia, ​​Minxian, Gangu, Chengxian, Ningding, Kangxian, Huixian, Huining, Gaotai, Wenxian, Zhengning, Guyuan, Yuzhong, Anxi, Qingyang, Heishui, Huanxian, Ningxian, Kangle Provisional Administration Bureau, Tianshui, Haiyuan, Yongjing, etc. As many as forty-five counties. The number of people waiting for relief is about 1.5 million. The counties report disasters and ask for relief, and the situation is urgent. Although the relief authorities have repeatedly appealed and pleaded for the people, since the past two years, we have heard that no relief money has been distributed to various places. The disaster victims call for help without any response, and those who are trapped to death do not know how many. Now it is the cold winter and the weather is extremely cold. The lives of the disaster victims are even more difficult to maintain. As a result, those who flee and beg for food fill the roads, and those who die from cold and starvation are seen every day. The tragic situation is unbearable to describe. Alas, my people of Gansu, what sin have they committed to come to this! Our association cannot remain silent after seeing our compatriots die every day. In addition to jointly telegraphing the relevant authorities to request the allocation of emergency relief for assistance, we also hope that benevolent people at home and kind people overseas will pity the depth of the disaster suffered by the border people, and appreciate the virtue of heaven's love of life, and show great compassion and quickly provide relief, so that the surviving disaster victims will not perish completely. Then, you will create immeasurable merit. The electric message is tearful, and we are extremely looking forward to it.

<h3>Raid on Tongzhou Ship Pirates Solved in Huiyang, Guangdong</h3>
<p>Six Pirates Fled to the Coast of Haifeng County</p>
<p>Four Pirates Landed in Guliao, Huiyang with Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Huiyang Military Police Arrested One Pirate Alive</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Tongzhou ship was robbed by pirates on its voyage from Shanghai to Zhifu at the end of last month. The pirates forced the ship to sail back to Paiyas Bay and escaped. After the Guangdong provincial authorities heard about the escape of the pirates, they immediately ordered coastal counties to intercept them. The Huiyang County government received a tip-off that the pirates had landed on the coast on the 6th of this month. They immediately dispatched the Third Platoon of the Guard Corps, together with the Special Service Battalion of the Defense Army, to search around Renshan, a subordinate county. When passing through Dapudun, Zhong Yuanhua, the chief of the Eleventh District, relayed a report from fishermen that around 2 AM on the 5th, someone broke into the gate of a thatched hut near Aoli Village in Xiaomo Township, claiming there was no need to panic. The villagers woke up from their dreams and caught sight of four strong men, carrying short guns, ordering the fishermen Zhuang and Tang to show them the way. After asking, they left, saying that there were many items left on the shore, which the fishermen could take. The fishermen Zhuang et al. took candles to the seaside and saw a small boat docked, containing two homemade guns, five bundles of silver coins, and three leather bags. The four pirates were already far away. They had no choice but to report the information to the Xiaomo Township Office and the Renshan District Office. Upon receiving the report, the military police immediately ordered the local guard reserve team to search in all directions. At the same time, they coordinated with the Paiyas Bay Naval Special Service Team to search forward towards Jixiang. At dawn on the 6th, they arrived at the Fengxiangu Temple area in the Twelfth District of the county and discovered the trail of the pirates. The soldiers and police simultaneously divided into groups to intercept them, and finally captured the pirate Fan Shui alive. The remaining three pirates fled into the mountains and are still being pursued. According to the pirate Fan Shui, there were a total of ten people involved in the robbery of the Tongzhou ship, commanded by the ringleader. Most of the accomplices were from Huiyang and Haifeng. After ten people discussed it, they disguised themselves as passengers on January 17th and took cars from Pingshan and Renshan in Huiyang, and Chishi墩 in Haifeng, to Haifeng. They stayed in Haifeng overnight. The next morning (18th), they gathered in Haifeng and took a car to Shantou. On the 19th, they took the Yuezhou ship from Shantou and arrived in Shanghai on the 24th. They stayed at the Ping An Inn and the Asia Hotel. At night, the ten people gathered and discussed many times, deciding to rob the Tongzhou ship. They boarded the Tongzhou ship on the morning of the 29th. At 10 AM, the ship set sail for Zhifu and Tianjin. After sailing for about half a day from Shanghai, they planned to start, but because it was inconvenient to rob during the day, they waited until 8 PM to take action. All ten accomplices pulled out guns. Some went to the ship's engine room first and shot dead a Russian guard. Then they went to the wheelhouse. When the guard at the drawbridge resisted, he was also shot dead. A group was responsible for searching for and confiscating weapons on the ship, totaling nineteen self-defense guns. Then they began searching and robbing, obtaining 1,300 Hong Kong banknotes from passengers, five boxes of banknotes from the Tianjin China Bank, and other items, which were bundled in hemp bags. The ringleader forced the helmsman to turn the Tongzhou ship back south. At 2 PM on February 1st, they arrived at the Zhelang sea area in Haifeng County, where a pirate ship was waiting to meet them. They transported the stolen goods to the pirate ship. At that time, a plane suddenly appeared in the sky, heading towards them. The accomplices were frightened. Six people took the Tongzhou ship's sampan and landed on the Zhelang coast. The remaining four people, along with the stolen goods, sailed the pirate ship to Guliao in Xiaomo Township, Huiyang County, and landed. Seeing a warship in the distance, shining its searchlight, they were afraid of being discovered, so they had to land from Guliao. The robbed boxes of banknotes and heavy stolen goods were inconvenient to carry, so they threw them into the water. After the four landed ashore, they fled along the mountains bordering Huiyang and Haifeng. They had a meal at 　bei and divided the Hong Kong banknotes they had robbed, each getting thirty yuan, intending to go home for the New Year. Unexpectedly, they encountered military police near Fengxiangu Temple and were captured. Three companions had fled to Haifeng, etc. (11th)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Gold Mines in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This province is rich in mineral products, but unfortunately, due to the lack of promoters in the past, the benefits were abandoned to the ground. Since the merger of the Department of Industry and Commerce into the Department of Construction, the authorities have been considering mining gold mines. However, because the mining area still needs to be surveyed, it has not been implemented. Recently, the Department of Construction appointed Chang Ji'an, a mining and metallurgy expert, to be responsible for the survey. (Chang studied mining and metallurgy in the United States at a young age, obtained a master's degree, and practiced in well-known gold factories in the western United States in his spare time, with rich experience.) Chang spent two months first going to western Shandong, then to eastern Shandong, to conduct on-site inspections. He has now completed his work and returned to the province. It is said that he has surveyed several gold mines that can be mined. The following is a summary of his investigation report:</p>
<p>(1) The Formation and Reserves of Gold Mines in Various Counties of Shandong: Gold mines in various counties of Shandong are divided into two types: mountain gold and placer gold. The placer gold mines in eastern Shandong should be the most important in Datang Mountain, Qixia. Its alluvial deposits have been raised to a high level by orogenic movements, but its formation is no different from other placer gold deposits remaining at the bottom of rivers. However, after years of mining, there is little rich sand left, so there is no great hope. Except for Tanshan in Wenshang, where the veins are irregular and worthless, the mountain gold mines include Jinniu Mountain and Guidao Mountain in Muping, Shuangshan and Xiezishan in Pingdu, and Linglong Mountain and Qingshuiwa in Zhaoyuan. All of them are fissure deposits, roughly the same as those seen in the copper mines of Bisbee, Arizona, USA, and the gold mines of California. There is hope for deep extension and enrichment. If the reserves are calculated, even within 300 feet below the ground, averaging the lowest component per ton of ore, the total gold reserves in Zhaoyuan, Muping, and Pingdu counties are no less than 29,375,000 taels.</p>
<p>(2) The Current Operations of Gold Mines in Various Counties of Shandong: The current operations of gold mines in various counties of Shandong are mostly conservative, picking up the remaining sand from the predecessors. The reason why they have not been able to progress is: (1) The rocks on both sides are hard, and the clumsy method of chiseling stone can only advance three inches a day. Therefore, mining work cannot be extended to deep and distant places. (2) The mines lack water absorption equipment, and all the water below the level of the flat tunnel is not treated. (3) If the ore contains too much sulfide, even if it contains a large amount of gold, it is regarded as unusable sand. Therefore, metallurgical technology must also find new ways.</p>
<p>(3) The Starting Point for Reorganizing Gold Mines in Various Counties of Shandong: The Shuangshan Gold Mine in Pingdu was sealed for owing official money. The Jinniu Mountain Gold Mine in Muping was taken back and operated independently. Each has its own project. Disputes have repeatedly arisen in Qingshuiwa and other places in Zhaoyuan. Except for the mining area of ​​about five square miles that has been led by the businessman Li Kai, the rest have not been granted rights. The remaining area is quite large. Rights should be granted to these three places first, and the easier ones should be tried first, and then mining and metallurgy should be carried out in order to establish a new model.</p>
<p>(4) The Future Hope of Reorganizing Gold Mines in Various Counties of Shandong: What should be the future status of gold production in Shandong? This is what we urgently want to know. The world's annual gold production is about 700 tons, and South Africa accounts for half of it. Other countries with annual production of more than 10 tons include the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, etc., but not China. However, China's production ten years ago did reach this number, but it soon fell. Shandong produced a lot of gold in ancient times, and its production is no longer verifiable. Fifty years ago, it once reached about 100,000 taels of gold per year. In the past one or two decades, it has declined abnormally, with annual production decreasing by hundreds of taels. The current annual output is approximately 3,000 taels. The area and mineral resources of neighboring Korea are no different from those of this province, and its gold production is 8.5 tons, equivalent to more than 200,000 taels. It has already achieved a considerable position among the gold-producing countries in the world. If Shandong Province makes rapid progress, capital and technology will cooperate and advance simultaneously. With the province's natural advantages and abundant reserves, gold production will definitely not lag behind. If we can seize the opportunity to make effective progress, not only will the treasures of the hinterland be developed, but also a new era will be opened in the history of Chinese mining.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Parricide Case Transferred to Suzhou</p>
<p>Fengjing Fourteenth: Sun Songpo, a villager in Huyingtang, smoked opium and did not engage in proper business. His nature was unruly and he was not subject to control. In June of last year, he killed his own father, Sun Laiqin, and abandoned the body in the fields. His mother, Sun, saw bloodstains on her son Songpo's clothes and knew he was the murderer. She sued and the court interrogated him, resulting in a death sentence to maintain moral integrity. The criminal refused to accept the first-instance judgment and appealed. The High Court approved the appeal and scheduled a hearing. After receiving the document, the court here prepared a document and sent bailiff Chen Rongding to escort the criminal to Suzhou on the 20th to await summons.</p>
<p>Worker Buried Alive While Digging Mud</p>
<p>There is a soil mountain in the corner of Siqiang in the city, with a large area and planted with trees. Recently, people from Jiangbei have been digging mud for several days. On the 19th, while the worker was digging, the hole became too deep. Around 3 PM, it suddenly collapsed. The worker Wei Sanbao, a native of Yancheng, was buried alive. People dug him out, and he was barely breathing. He was immediately carried to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. It was found that a corner of his left ear was crushed, his waist was injured, and his scrotum was broken, but fortunately, his testicles were unharmed. According to the doctor, if there are no changes within a day, there is no danger to his life.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Order to Investigate Construction Corruption</p>
<p>The bridges and culverts on the Xinzhoud段 of the Shangnan County Road have been built for some time, and the land filling project is currently underway after approval. However, some bridges have suddenly collapsed due to the pressure of the land filling. The county reported this situation to the Provincial Department of Construction for instructions. Yesterday, instructions were received that the steel-reinforced concrete bridges were built during the tenure of Zhu Wanmin, the former director of the Construction Bureau of the county. The original design drawings were not flawed. However, in a short period of time, as many as six bridges collapsed due to the filling of soil. The piles are only three or four tenths of a circle, with only one steel bar. The contractor, Ju Cheng Company, cut corners on materials, which is very obvious. The former director Zhu is also suspected of colluding in corruption. The county government is ordered to track down the former director of the Construction Bureau, Zhu Wanmin, and the manager of the contractor Ju Cheng Company, Zhang Guiyun, within fifteen days of the document's arrival, and strictly investigate them according to law.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Truth of Castration and Suicide Case Difficult to Determine</p>
<p>Qiaoquan, the adopted son of Yu Pan, of Shanren Bridge, went to his father-in-law Xu Shuqing's house in Xijin Village to visit his wife Xu Jinzhu but did not find her. Suddenly, he hanged himself from a beam, and at the same time, his genitals were found to have been cut off. The police station in charge took the related persons, the deceased's mother Yu Pan, the deceased's wife Xu Jinzhu, and Jinzhu's younger brothers Tuf金 and Rongnan, to the bureau, along with the cut-off genitals, and prepared a document to send to the city. After questioning Rongnan, the general bureau learned that he was twelve years old and his father (the deceased's father-in-law) had been crazy for many years. That day, he returned home from the fields and found his sister-in-law hanged himself at home, so he ran to his sister-in-law's house to report the news. Later, he personally saw Yu Pan cutting off his brother-in-law's penis with a knife. When questioned, Pan denied it. Yesterday afternoon (the 19th), the bureau transferred everyone to the local court. On the morning of yesterday (the 19th), the court sent prosecutor Xia Jingli, along with inspectors Xuan Fang and forensic doctor Mao, to the countryside to investigate. They returned to the city at dusk. The society is full of discussions because the details of this matter are bizarre, but the truth is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Judge Dismissed for Incorrect Application of Law</p>
<p>A lawyer from Suzhou previously sued his client in the local branch of the court for public fees, but was rejected. The lawyer filed an appeal with the original court's appellate court. The court president and presiding judge Xu Tigan, court president Liu Rongshan, and the handling judge Li Xirong opened a collegial panel for review, but the ruling was still rejected. Later, the lawyer learned that the legal provisions cited in the second-instance ruling were incorrect and complained to the Ministry of Justice, requesting strict punishment. Minister Wang verified that the ruling was inappropriate and ordered the dismissal of Judge Li, and recorded a major demerit for President Xu and President Liu. The Suzhou High Court has been ordered to notify them. It is reported that Judge Li left Wuxi for Beijing the day before yesterday after receiving the order.</p>
<p>Riots Caused by Gambling Arrests in Dangkou Town</p>
<p>The local Public Security Bureau and the Fire Brigade caused citywide strikes and riots due to gambling arrests and false fire alarms. The situation has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon around 3 PM, Wang Jifu, the chief of the Seventh Branch of the Eighth District Public Security Bureau in Dangkou Town, sent police to arrest gamblers at the Tianxiangge Teahouse in the town. Because the teahouse was actually conducting a rotating association and there was no gambling, a conflict occurred between the police and the tea guests. Four tea guests were beaten and injured by the police. At the same time, a policeman fell from the楼 and fainted on the ground. Seeing that the disaster had been caused, Chief Wang immediately ordered the police to return to the bureau. At that time, more and more villagers gathered outside, and the voices were noisy and the situation was tense. Hua Juncai, the standing committee member of the Second District Party Department, Hua Guanzhou, the assistant of the District Office, Hua Chuiyu, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and Hua Zhenqin, the town chief, went to the bureau to discuss the aftermath, but all failed. Therefore, public outrage was aroused, triggering a strike by five or six hundred shops in the town, demanding the replacement of Chief Wang. Seeing that the situation was expanding, Chief Wang immediately telegraphed the General Bureau for instructions, and then came to the city to report to the General Bureau. At the same time, the Tax Police Team stationed in the town, the Provincial Public Security Team patrol boat on the water, and the local Chamber of Commerce detachment patrol team were all dispatched to maintain order. Later, Hui Haoqian, the captain of the Chamber of Commerce patrol team in the town, came forward to mediate and first persuaded the shops to resume business. The incident of causing trouble by arresting gamblers will be resolved after consultation. Around 6 PM, the shops began to resume business first, and the riots temporarily subsided.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>County Government Rectifies and Restores Yitu</p>
<p>All the maps of Wuyi County have a Yitu organization. Each map is divided into ten villages, and each village has a village head, who is appointed by those with more fields. Each year, the village head acts as the annual collector to collect land tax from each grain household, and all the maps are completed in accordance with the regulations, without any arrears allowed. If there are arrears beyond the time limit, a request will be made to punish them. It has always been known as the Yitu good regulations. Before 1927, there were very few arrears in the years. After 1927, due to the exemption of old debts, the cunning annual collectors failed to pay after collecting money, and the industry owners also waited and watched. The map rules were destroyed and could not be cleaned up. The amount of land tax arrears increased day by day. County Magistrate Hou Houzong, in view of this, decided to request the Department of Finance to set up a Yitu commissioner in the county government to be responsible for rectifying and restoring Yitu. The candidate is selected by the county. After all the Yitu in the county is completed, all the arrears will be paid and the original state will be restored, and then it will be revoked.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Misunderstanding Between Villagers and Land Survey Team</p>
<p>The land survey project in this county started in the spring of last year and is progressing very quickly. It is now nearing completion. However, the villagers, who do not understand the principles, often have misunderstandings when working in the countryside, and conflicts occur from time to time. The other day, when the survey team went to the Mujia Alley area of Meili in the Second District to measure the land, the red flag on the triangulation frame was suddenly pulled off and damaged by the local children. When the survey team members asked the nearby people, a farmer who had drunk too much had a misunderstanding, which led to a conflict. For a time, they beat the drums to gather the people, and the two sides actually fought each other. All the triangulation frames were burned by the villagers. Three survey members were seriously injured by the beatings. The Meili Public Security Third Branch received the news and rushed to suppress the situation, but it was not resolved until late at night. The county government has sent personnel to the countryside to investigate the truth.</p>
<p>Hunan Refugees Leaving the Country Arrive in Suzhou</p>
<p>More than 280 Hunan refugees, men, women, old and young, came to Changshu from Wuxi on the 14th. They had an off-track incident in Yangjian Town and robbed along the way. Fortunately, the local business community was able to suppress the situation and there were no major losses. Then the refugees arrived in the city via Liantang Town. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent police to monitor them. On the 17th, they were given 32,000 copper coins and 12 policemen were sent to escort them out of the country on foot along the Suchang Highway. Unexpectedly, on the 18th, they had another off-track action in Mocheng Town. The police force was weak and they urgently telegraphed the General Bureau for police to be dispatched. At 9 AM, 40 more people were dispatched. On the same day, they cooperated with the local water police to escort them to Wuta Town, from where they left the country and reached Su County.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Gaoyou Patrol Officer Investigated for Investigating Smoking</p>
<p>Tan Shuren, a patrol officer of the Fifth Substation of the First Branch of the Gaoyou Public Security Bureau, was ordered by the county government to investigate the case of Chen Xuesui, a villager in Zhanggongdu, Songjia Bridge, on the border of Jiangyou, who was smoking without a license. Tan then led armed police officers to go on the 11th of the lunar new year and arrested Chen in a bathroom. Chen's family heard the news and gathered many people to surround and negotiate with Tan et al. As they talked, they walked to the border of Jiangdu. More and more villagers gathered, and the police fired warning shots. The villagers also beat the drums to gather more than 3,000 people to resist, injuring patrol officer Tan Shuren and police officer Sheng Decai et al. When the Youyi County Government heard the news, it sent a team to rescue Tan and intercepted him. The villagers also detained the injured police officer Sheng Decai. On the 18th, Chen Xuesui brought Sheng Decai to the Jiangdu District Procuratorate to turn himself in and accused patrol officer Tan Shuren et al. of fraud. After questioning by the procuratorate, Sheng Decai was ordered to go out for medical treatment and await trial.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau</p>
<p>Line Construction Work Plan</p>
<p>Since completing the provincial telecommunications network, the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau has started the construction of urban and rural telephones in various places. Recently, Zhao Zengjue, director of the bureau, believed that due to the development of business and the congestion of the original trunk lines, it was necessary to add telephone lines to cope with the situation. The bureau's recent line construction work plan is recorded as follows: (1) Add a pair of telephone lines between Shaoxing and Ningbo. After the opening of telephone communication between Zhejiang and Shanghai, Ningbo and Hangzhou have a lot of communication with this city due to commercial relations. Now that the Zhejiang Provincial Authorities have installed new long-distance telephone repeaters, the sound transmission of Shanghai-Ningbo telephones is exceptionally clear, and telephone services have developed rapidly. There were originally three pairs of provincial bureau telephone lines between Hangzhou and Shaoxing, but there were only two pairs of telephone lines between Shaoxing and Ningbo, which was insufficient for distribution. The Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau decided to build a pair of telephone lines between Shaoxing and Ningbo to cope with the situation. People are now being sent to survey the area and prepare materials, and construction will begin soon. (2) Survey the line construction project between Hangzhou and Wukang. Hangzhou and Wukang are important lines for Mogan Mountain to communicate with Hangzhou and Shanghai. The bureau has included it in the budget and decided to start construction in the shortest possible time. Recently, the bureau has sent Yang Jiaben, the former director of the Second Engineering Team, to conduct an on-site survey of the line situation and prepare a construction plan. It is currently in progress. (3) Carry out the construction of rural lines in Zhenhai County. Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province, entrusted the Provincial Telephone Bureau to build two rural lines from Xiaojiang to Gangkou and from Xiaojiang to Qingzhi. The machine fee was not paid before, so it could not be built immediately. Now that the county has paid the machine fee, the bureau will send personnel to Zhenhai to conduct an on-site survey of the lines as soon as possible to facilitate construction and benefit the people.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Careless Gambling Causes Two Deaths by Fire</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, gambling has been rampant in the four townships of Xiaoshan. The 18th was the night of the Lantern Festival. At the home of Zhang Laishun, a resident of Shimen in the western township, a foreign lamp was overturned due to gambling, igniting the bed curtains. In an instant, the fire was bright and unstoppable. A total of six buildings, five flat houses, and four thatched huts were burned. The most tragic thing was that Zhang's 70-year-old mother and two 3-year-old daughters did not escape in time when the fire broke out and were buried in the fire.</p>

Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, all circles in this city held an anniversary commemoration meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce auditorium at Tianhou Temple Bridge. Approximately over a thousand people, including Mayor Wu Tiecheng, attended. The atmosphere at the meeting was quite enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue</p>
<p>The venue was located in the large auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Temple Bridge. A temporary archway made of pine and cypress branches was erected in front of the entrance, with a white cloth banner hanging above reading "Shanghai All Circles Hold the First Anniversary Commemoration Meeting of the New Life Movement". In the center of the rostrum, a portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung, flanked by the national flag and the KMT party flag. Order sheets were posted on both sides. Another white cloth banner reading "Shanghai All Circles Hold the First Anniversary Commemoration Meeting of the New Life Movement" was hung in front of the stage. The venue was decorated with printed five-color slogans. In addition to the seating for the presidium and the podium, record-keeping seats were arranged on both sides. The arrangement was solemn, tidy, and beautiful.</p>
<p>Solemn Order</p>
<p>The venue was guarded and maintained in order by over 200 people, including police officers from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, Boy Scouts, and students from the Guard Committee Cadre Training Class. When the speakers on the presidium mentioned Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, all students of the cadre training class stood at attention to salute, which was quite novel. All participants arrived before 9:30 AM, which was quite different from other meetings. Smoking was prohibited at the venue, which was a unique feature of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Representatives from All Circles</p>
<p>Attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya, Director of the Public Security Bureau Wen Chaoji, Committee Members of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Tong Xingbai, Lu Jingshi, Director of the Security Office Yang Hu, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting, Jiang Huaisu of the Shanghai Security Committee, as well as guests from various trade associations, labor unions, schools of all levels, and various organizations and institutions, totaling over 1,200 people. Wu Tiecheng served as the instructor, and Wu Xingya, Tong Xingbai, Lu Jingshi, Yu Hongjun, Yang Hu, Wen Chaoji, Zhang Shouyong, and six others formed the presidium. The meeting started promptly at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Xingya reported: "Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek initiated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, the entire nation has been inspired and has been striving to implement it. In the past year, we have achieved remarkable results. Our dispirited nation has begun to gain new vitality and has fully demonstrated signs of striving for strength. Looking back on this New Life Movement anniversary today, it is deeply gratifying to us. However, if we think for a moment, what is the standard of the New Life Movement? Have we achieved everything one by one? This depends on our continued efforts. In the past year, there have been many people who have been able to practice the New Life Movement, but there are still many citizens who are hesitant, watching, fearing difficulties, and seeking temporary ease, thinking that the New Life Movement is a very special and very specialized movement. This is really a mistake. Mr. Chiang said, 'The current New Life Movement is to make the daily life of every citizen knowable and doable, based on the foundation of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and following the "neatness," "cleanliness," "simplicity," "plainness," "promptness," and "precision" that we advocate as standards, to practice them personally at all times and in all places. This is a very ordinary, very simple, and habitual life movement, without any restrictions on scope, time, and region, and without any distinction of social class.' From this, we can know that the so-called New Life is our daily habits. We only need to pay attention to our daily life from morning to night, what are the old and bad habits, get rid of them, what are the new and good ones, that is, the several principles that Mr. Chiang has proclaimed, and practice them at all times and in all places, so that they gradually become habits, and this is considered a success. Why do we have to do this? Mr. Chiang also said that if we want to revive our country and nation in the future, we must fundamentally start from improving the people's knowledge and morality. Where should we start to improve the people's knowledge and morality? This will talk about the basic life of the general public, the so-called clothing, food, housing, and transportation. A person's or a nation's spirit, thought, knowledge, and morality can all be expressed from basic life. The reason why China has always been invaded and oppressed can be summed up in one sentence: the basic life of our general public cannot conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. The New Life Movement is to make the lives of our national citizens conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, suitable for modern survival, and to show the noble knowledge and morality of our entire nation. Therefore, as long as we practice the New Life Movement, we are laying the foundation for the revival of the nation. Now the New Life Movement has reached one year, and the level of public knowledge is so low. It is naturally difficult to seek widespread prevalence. Therefore, this responsibility for promotion cannot but fall on intellectuals and leaders from all walks of life. Mr. Chiang said at the memorial week of the Jiangxi Camp, 'The responsibility for improving society and reviving the country and nation, in fact, cannot be expected to be fulfilled by all citizens. It completely depends on those of us who are knowledgeable and who are leaders of the country and the people, who can take up this responsibility and earnestly work by setting an example, so that we can promote the common awakening, striving, and cooperation of the national citizens.' Therefore, in the past year, intellectuals and folk leaders in various places have organized branches one after another to advocate and implement it. The Shanghai branch has also been produced in this sense. On the one hand, Shanghai is the center of national economy and culture, and every word and deed is enough to stir up the national vision and hearing. On the other hand, it is also a complicated area where Chinese and foreigners live together, and every move is often restricted by the facts and difficult to realize suddenly. Therefore, the New Life Movement in Shanghai is the most important, but also a more difficult task. Thanks to the efforts of leaders and comrades from all walks of life in the past year, the overall results have not been very backward, which is deeply gratifying. Taking advantage of today's New Life Movement anniversary, I would like to reiterate the meaning of the New Life Movement and the key points that the leaders have shown to us, so as to not forget and to express the meaning of review. I would like to encourage myself and encourage all comrades."</p>
<p>Mayor's Instructions</p>
<p>After Chairman Wu Xingya's report, instructor and Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave instructions: "Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, comrades, today is the first anniversary of the New Life Movement, which is also the day to commemorate the theory of the New Life Movement published by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang last February 19th, and the new era of leading the nation to implement the New Life Movement. In the process of revolution, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek discovered a common problem throughout the country. This problem is not only enough to hinder the progress of the National Revolution, but also can lead to the demise of our country and the elimination of our nation. Therefore, based on the principle of revolutionizing the heart before revolution, and revitalizing the people before revitalizing the country, the New Life Movement was initiated in Nanchang, requiring the people of the whole country to unanimously engage in the revolution of life. This cannot but be said to be a major progress in the national revival movement. Comrades, we can use our sensitive perception and rich experience to review many past things and obtain the true meaning of national survival. Whether the rise or fall of a country, the prosperity or decline of a nation, or the rise and fall of a family, the success or failure of a person's career, is not an accident, but there is a certain reason for it. If our lives are like a train running on tracks, then it will surely prosper and succeed. Conversely, if our lives cannot get on track, then there will be no failure or decline. China's inherent morality, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, are the normal track of our daily life. Moreover, an era has its own life and spirit. In our current era, there is a kind of life and spirit different from the past. The life of this era is to be 'rationalized'. A rationalized life must be able to get on track. The life of the entire nation can be rationalized and get on track. Only then can this nation be revived and become a new era nation with solidarity. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek instructed us to implement the New Life Movement, first starting from the individual, and then extending it to the entire nation. He also instructed us to start from 'neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and plainness', and to achieve the militarization, industrialization, and artisticization of our lives, and to set 'propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame', the inherent morality of our Chinese nation, as the highest principle for each of us to deal with the world, so that this new spirit can penetrate into our daily life, clothing, food, housing, and transportation, forming a trend and becoming a habit. Once this trend and habit are formed, the New Life Movement can last forever and become a force to transform, promote, and revive the nation. The New Life Movement has been working and spreading in Shanghai for nearly a year. Have our Shanghai comrades and Shanghai citizens clearly understood the significance of the New Life Movement in this year? Is the need for a new life urgent or not? When a new life is urgently needed, to what extent do we, the people who implement the New Life Movement in Shanghai, practice it? This is what our Shanghai comrades and citizens should earnestly examine at today's anniversary of the New Life Movement. Our examination of the past is to encourage the future. The New Life Movement is not a matter of one morning and one evening, but a national policy of hundreds of years and thousands of years. First of all, it must be personally practiced by the people from all parts of the country who love the nation, save the country, and believe in the New Life Movement, set an example, and popularize it to the masses, so that it can succeed. Therefore, after examining our work in the past year today, we must intensify our efforts to promote the New Life Movement, so that the New Life Movement can be gradually popularized and gradually successful in Shanghai. If the New Life Movement in a city can be popularized and successful, then this city will also prosper accordingly, and the people living in this city, regardless of farmers, workers, merchants, students, and various industries, will be able to succeed in their careers because of the rationalization of life. As a result of the concerted efforts of the whole country to promote the New Life Movement, the life of our Chinese nation will naturally have the hope of revival. This is what we should jointly encourage in addition to commemoration today."</p>

<p>Speech by Mr. Tong</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Tong Xingbai, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, gave a speech saying, "I am here on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee to participate in the New Life Commemoration Meeting, but in terms of theory, someone has already explained it in detail. As for the implementation of the New Life Movement, it does not rely solely on theory. In my humble opinion, there are two directions: one direction is to promote it from the social aspect, and the other direction is to create it from the individual aspect. With the gradual evolution of the two aspects, the New Life Movement can then be promoted to the people and popularized to all aspects. That is, those who are engaged in group work should pay attention to creating a good environment, so that people can see the promotion of the New Life Movement everywhere and stimulate their hearts. In terms of groups, they should work hard. As for individual creation, it is also necessary to restrain oneself and cultivate oneself, build good personal habits, and transform bad people into good ones. Then the New Life Movement will naturally be implemented imperceptibly," and so on. Afterwards, Zhang Shouyong, Yang Hu, and others gave speeches successively, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Railway New Life Movement Anniversary Meeting</h3>
<p>And Held a Grand Review</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways held a New Life Movement Anniversary Meeting in the conference room of the Shanghai North Railway Station yesterday. Originally, Director Wu Tiecheng was designated by the General Association to attend the meeting to give instructions, but because the Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association also had the same commemorative ceremony, Secretary Zhang Yuanruo of the Shanghai Municipal Government was entrusted to deliver the instructions on behalf of the association. The meeting was scheduled to start at 9:00 AM, presided over by Deputy Director Wu Shao, who was also the acting director and executive secretary. After performing the rituals, the chairman reported on the significance of the commemoration. Then, Secretary Zhang delivered instructions. Finally, the chairman announced several skills to implement the New Life Movement, hoping that colleagues would earnestly do it and create a trend. The meeting was closed at 10:00 AM, and a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a grand review was held. Acting Director Wu Shao and the executive secretary, together with various secretaries, conducted a detailed review of various departments and offices of the bureau and the North, South, and other stations. As for the various sections of the entire line, each service group held separate reviews. The association sent personnel to give instructions and participate in the reviews. On the same day, the railway daily also compiled and distributed a special issue commemorating the New Life Movement on the spot.</p>
<h3>Anniversary Meeting of the New Life Movement by the Seamen's Party Branch</h3>
<p>Secretary Chen Songping's Report</p>
<p>And Distributing New Life Booklets</p>
<p>The Special Party Branch of the Chinese Seamen held a New Life Movement anniversary meeting in the auditorium of the Party Branch yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Attendees included all committee members, staff members, and members of the district party branch of the Shanghai District Party Committee, as well as representatives from dozens of groups, including the Navigation Joint Righteousness Association, the Maritime Affairs Department, the Jiangdu Catering Department, the Small Wheel Department, the Navigation Helmsman Carpenter Mutual Aid Association, the Chinese Navigation Driver Association, the Nanjun Anlian Charity Association, the Yan Ying General Society, the Yan Ying South Society, the Chinese Ship Wireless Telegraphers Public Welfare Association, and the Chinese Seamen's Ticketing Mutual Aid Association, totaling over 300 people. The venue was decorated with flags and colorful decorations, which were colorful and dazzling. After the presidium members Yang Hu, Wang Yongsheng, and Chen Songping led the attendees to perform the rituals, Secretary Chen Songping reported, first expounding on the meaning of the New Life, saying that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the spiritual creeds of the New Life, and simplicity and plainness, neatness and cleanliness are the formal creeds of the New Life. If we can base ourselves on these creeds and act on ourselves, we will surely be a healthy new people. If we act on society, it will not be difficult to create a new and prosperous country. Then, he painfully discussed the errors in the national concept of life, such as the ancient Wang Meng talking about state affairs while catching lice, and Wang Jinggong going to the examination barefoot and not bathing for three years, which people regarded as romantic at the time, which is really laughable. Finally, he encouraged our seafarer comrades to wash their hearts and reform, and enthusiastically strive for the practice of the New Life, sweeping away the past style of procrastination, filth, and filth, etc. At the same time, the Propaganda Section of the association distributed New Life Movement pamphlets, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Security Office and the Special Party Branch Regularly Hold Cleanliness Campaigns</h3>
<p>Designated Streets for Cleaning</p>
<p>Appointed Inspectors</p>
<p>In order to promote the New Life Movement and arouse public attention, the Municipal Security Office and the Special Party Branch of the office will hold a cleanliness campaign starting from the 21st of this month, organizing sweeping, stretcher, and propaganda teams to work. Since the deadline is approaching, the preparations of the office and the branch are even more tense. Therefore, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Discussion Meeting The office and the branch convened representatives of party branches at all levels and teams at the party branch auditorium at 1:00 PM yesterday to hold a discussion meeting. More than 60 representatives attended to discuss the implementation methods in detail. The meeting did not end until after 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Determining the Routes The cleaning routes of the teams of the office have also been designated. It is reported that they are the Municipal Government Road, Xiaomu Bridge Road, Xietu Road, South Railway Station, Zhaojia Road, Baoshan Road, Hongxing Road, Datong Road, Hengfeng Road, North Railway Station, Zhongshan Road, Gonghe Road, Jinyi Road, Longhua, Tanzi Bay, Tanjia Bridge, Sanjiaodi, Xujiahui Road, Zhoujia Bridge, West Guangfu Road, Gaochang Temple, Pengpu Road, and Naxiang, Liuhe, and Bailonggang in the suburbs. Although the distribution is somewhat scattered, it can be as widespread as scheduled.</p>
<p>Appointing Inspectors In order to achieve the effectiveness of the work, the office and the branch specially appointed a large number of inspectors to conduct assessments and judge the merits and demerits. Yesterday, it was planned to appoint Cheng Gongxia, Li Wusheng, Fang Zhengqing, Zhang Qixiang, Wang Chengzhi, Mei Xueyan, Liu Wanjun, Wang Jiyi, Chen Zhuomin, Wen Huazhou, Mi Xi, Zou Yuzhen, Wang Weiming, Qi Xueqi, Lu Yulin, Tong Baohui, Wu Chuanxin, Zhou Tianjian, etc. as inspectors, and designated Cheng Gongxia, Wang Chengzhi, Chen Zhuomin, and Qi Xueqi as chief inspectors to conduct district inspections in order to supervise. It is also reported that the time for the general cleaning has been set from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM on the 21st. At that time, the Health Bureau will also be invited to send sprinklers to assist in the work.</p>
<h3>The Far East Is Not Much Affected After the US Gold Clause Ruling</h3>
<p>The Greater America Evening News states that, according to responsible sources close to the National Government, the US Supreme Court's ruling on the gold clause has little to do with the Far East. Several national governments are certainly relieved by this because they can now pay their debts to the United States with the current devalued US dollars without the controversy of repaying with the original value of the US dollars. As for China, its debt to the United States is relatively small, so the above-mentioned dispute has not occurred. However, now that this ruling has been made, the possibility of its occurrence can also be eliminated. According to news from New York, foreign exchange rates rose across the board this morning, but Chinese exchange rates were not affected in any way. It is now believed that this ruling has no fundamental relationship with the commercial or financial markets in this port. When the news of the ruling reached Shanghai, it was only a few minutes before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, so it was difficult for speculators in this port to take any action. Although the brokers' phones were extremely busy last night, the trading volume was not strong because the wording of the gold clause was still difficult to grasp. Most of the transactions were profit-taking.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee Purchases Silver from London and Ships It to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The First Batch of 3 Million Yuan Has Been Loaded on a Ship to Shanghai</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Discuss Investing in China with Silver</p>
<p>Central Bank Transports 11 Million Yuan to Sichuan</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that after the Ministry of Finance stipulated the measures to encourage silver imports, the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and the Chief Inspector of Customs have been ordered to announce and implement them. At the same time, the Central Bank has notified various foreign banks to comply.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Discuss Investing in China</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from foreign banking circles yesterday that after our country imposed export taxes and equalization taxes on silver, foreign merchants in China were unwilling to invest in our country's market with the silver they obtained through trade because it was too uneconomical and unprofitable. Now that the government has implemented measures to encourage silver imports, foreign merchants have discussed shipping silver back to China to invest in our country's market because they can be exempted from export taxes and equalization taxes when they re-export it in the future, and it is profitable. As for foreign banks shipping silver back to Shanghai, it is not temporarily necessary in fact, because foreign banks in Shanghai have already made preparations for their inventory. Although it is not very sufficient now, there is no need to worry. Whether it is needed in the future will be decided at any time.</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee Purchases Silver from England and Ships It to Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the market, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee entrusted the China Communications Bank Hong Kong branch to purchase silver and ship it to Shanghai. A total of 2,936,500 yuan has arrived. The original plan was 20 million yuan. Now, because the price of silver in the Hong Kong market has increased, it has been changed to purchase it from the London market in England. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Mr. Zhang Peishen, a member of the committee, yesterday. According to him, it is true that the committee purchased silver from London. The first batch of 3 million yuan has been loaded on a ship to Shanghai. Whether to continue purchasing from London in the future will be decided at any time depending on whether the market needs it. It is reported that the silver will arrive in Shanghai in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Equalization Tax Rate Is Announced Daily</p>
<p>The equalization tax rate announced by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee at 10:00 AM every day is not contrary to the measures to encourage silver imports. The rumor that it will be cancelled is absolutely untrue. The tax rate announced yesterday was 5.75% per cent. As for the telegraphic transfer selling price announced by the Central Bank, yesterday the exchange rate for each British pound was 1 shilling 5.75 pence, for each 100 yuan it was 36.1875 US dollars, for each 100 yuan it was 536 francs, and for each 100 yuan it was 89 marks.</p>
<p>500,000 Hong Kong Silver Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>It was reported that 500,000 Hong Kong silver purchased by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the President Jackson of the Great China Company. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the committee members Xi Demao and Zhang Peishen yesterday, and they said that they had not heard of it. However, according to another source, it may have been shipped by foreign merchants.</p>
<p>Silver Coins and Banknotes Are Loaded on Ships to Be Shipped to Sichuan</p>
<p>After the Central Bank established a branch in Chongqing, it is reported that the Shanghai Central Bank has loaded 10 million yuan in banknotes and 1 million yuan in silver coins, totaling 11 million yuan, on the customs patrol ship Wenxing to be shipped to Sichuan. It is reported that it is for the use of the Chongqing branch.</p>

<h3>British Expert Mr. Strand Discusses the Goals of the Cooperative Movement</h3>
<p>—Speech at the Agricultural Cooperation Seminar of the Shanghai Bank—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank's Agriculture Department recently held a business conference, and invited Dr. Stephen, an American expert in agricultural cooperative movements, and Dr. Strand, a British cooperative expert, to discuss cooperative issues for a week. Although the cooperative movement has a considerable history in China, the general public still does not fully understand this issue. A reporter from the Central News Agency has specially collected several of the speech manuscripts from the seminar to provide the people of the country with basic knowledge about cooperative issues. This article is based on a speech given by Dr. Strand at 2:00 PM on February 11th in the bank's sixth-floor conference hall. Dr. Strand was previously commissioned by the Indian government to manage numerous cooperatives. The performance of Indian cooperatives varied, but those within Dr. Strand's management were particularly outstanding due to his long service and rich experience. This speech elaborates in detail on the goals of the cooperative movement and should be regarded as one of the important documents by anyone interested in the cooperative movement. Although the speech was delivered in English, it was jointly recorded and translated by Zhang Luluan, Zhu Yaqiang, and Cheng Shen, and there are no errors in the translation. The following is the text of Mr. Strand's speech:</p>
<p>The whole world is now paying attention to discussing the issue of China's construction. In this era of economic panic, China is encountering a difficult period, and farmers are suffering even more. In other countries in Asia, farmers are also in dire straits, but the situation is different from that in China. In places like Africa and Egypt, they are even more oppressed by debt. Therefore, the greatest suffering in China is poverty, and there are three reasons for this poverty: (1) Since the mutual trade between China and foreign countries, and the convenience of transportation, Western goods have been pouring in, and the original family industries have been severely hit by machine-made products. In the past, farmers could exchange what they had for what they lacked, which was the so-called barter. Now, however, they must use money for transactions. Farmers are not yet fully accustomed to or clear about the use of money. The use of money is not appropriate between input and output, and as a result, they are easily exploited by merchants. This is the first cause of poverty. (2) Overcrowding is often found in places with good public security. This is the greatest driving force behind civil wars and banditry, as well as water and drought disasters, which displace people from their places of production. Therefore, internal strife, banditry, water and drought disasters are the second cause of poverty. (3) In addition to the economy, the social situation within China is also undergoing revolutionary changes. For example, customs and habits, as Western culture and education are introduced into China, the old culture is eroded by them, and people's thoughts and actions, and thus their living standards, are gradually rising. This phenomenon is particularly evident in cities. The desires of modern young people are increasing, but the increase in income cannot keep pace with it, so income cannot meet expenses. This is the third cause of poverty. The above three are the main causes of poverty in China. There are also three others that are generally considered to be causes of poverty, but I deny them, namely: 1. High interest rates, 2. Excessive taxes, and 3. High rents. These three are not the root causes of poverty, but rather its symptoms. To treat a disease, one must investigate its cause. I believe that China's cooperative undertakings should not be limited to a small scope but should focus on all aspects to transform the foundation of China. Moreover, cooperative undertakings should not be limited to rural areas but should also include urban areas. They should not focus solely on the economy but should also pay attention to society and spread throughout the country. I do not mean that the cooperative movement can encompass everything, as there are also things that the cooperative movement cannot do, such as politics and religion. There are many charitable and educational organizations, and popular education movements, such as the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee's disaster relief work, which are matters outside of cooperation. Basic industries such as old industrial trade associations and commercial associations are also closely related to cooperation. Only by using the power of the government to do so, the government power can achieve: 1. Relieve people's suffering, using legislation to limit the maximum rent, which is a passive measure that can only treat the symptoms of the disease, not the root cause. For example, restricting usury with political power cannot achieve the greatest effect, and it has an adverse impact on the financial market. Therefore, relieving usury cannot be done by law, but rather by using a rural financial organization to make interest rates appropriate. At the same time, limiting rents does not have much effect either. If a certain area has little land and many tenant farmers, there is no way to limit it. If so, even if all the landlords are killed, it is impossible to move tenant farmers to the city or undeveloped barren areas. Therefore, the result of forcing it with political power is contrary to economic principles and is actually impossible. However, politics can help promote it from a positive perspective, or restrict farmers from doing certain types of things, such as restricting cotton from being mixed with water, or specifying a certain market and designating cotton to be sold in that market, so that the government can implement inspections to see if the products are pure. Also, the government can force farmers to join farmers' associations and make them use certain improved methods of cultivation, which has already been done in East Africa. However, the government cannot completely overdo it, because if many farmers violate government regulations, there will inevitably not be enough police to monitor and restrict them. Only for one or two major agricultural products can restrictions be imposed. There are things that the government can do but cooperatives cannot, such as water conservancy and irrigation projects. The government must also maintain security and order, appoint honest officials, and improve politics. For agricultural issues, it can improve the tax system so that farmers bear the burden equally. Developing rural industries can accommodate the surplus rural population. However, the government is not omnipotent, and the people should also automatically organize a group to cooperate with the government. This kind of group that can help the government build is the cooperative. I (Mr. Strand) agree with the characteristics of the cooperative organization described by Mr. Stephen, that is, the economic function is carried out by itself. The cooperative organization is the foundation of democracy, and its purpose is to seek benefits for the public, such as transportation and marketing cooperation, and savings. There is currently one point: cooperative organizations are the combination of people, not the combination of capital. Compared with companies, the differences are: (1) Cooperative organizations are the combination of people, and company organizations are the combination of wealth. (2) Cooperative organizations are democratic and are the foundation of democracy. Company organizations determine the size of their power based on the amount of wealth. (3) The business of cooperative organizations is managed by the members themselves, and the relationship is close. After company shareholders pay their shares, they no longer ask about the company. (4) Every member of a cooperative organization hopes to save money, and every member of a company organization only knows how to obtain greater profits. The so-called cooperation refers to the general term, not just credit cooperation. The cooperative movement has been around for a hundred years, and the following four people are the founders of the cooperative movement: 1. Englishman Owed, 2. Frenchman Fowrier, 3. German Raiffeied, 4. German Schulze. The former two focused on urban cooperative movements, and the latter focused on rural cooperation. The first cooperative movements were in cities, and governments around the world were deeply afraid of them because they were advocating the labor movement at the time. Later, it gradually spread to Eastern European governments, which began to express sympathy. Afterwards, the use of cooperatives in rural areas to improve rural areas spread, and urban cooperation gradually recovered. Eastern Europe, such as Russia and Romania, used the cooperative movement as an aid to the government's policy implementation. Now the cooperative movement has spread to almost all over the world, and only five countries, such as Persia, have not yet been popularized. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Money Trade Association Decides on New Business Policy</h3>
<p>Cautious Lending to Protect Depositors' Safety</p>
<p>Limiting Loans to Merchants Purchasing Foreign Goods</p>
<p>*Shen Shi News Agency:* This year, the money trade in Shanghai has been affected by the economic downturn, and the situation is more difficult than in previous years. In order to determine future business policies, the Money Trade Association convened its members the other day to discuss and negotiate at the Money Trade Association. According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the discussion resulted in a decision to abide by three business policies to provide relief: (1) The mortgages that the three major Chinese banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China, had placed with various money shops at the end of the last term, still had more than five million yuan that could not be redeemed on time. These mortgages were usually due in February, and they had to be redeemed or requested to be extended when they expired, which made the money shops feel uneasy and constrained. Therefore, the money trade now hopes that the Central Bank and other banks will extend the deadline to March 1st to facilitate turnover. (2) Announce to all money shops that they will not provide credit loans to merchants who purchase foreign goods, especially those who sell luxury goods, in order to reduce imports and indirectly reduce the massive export of silver. (3) Before the market returns to normal, all money shops should adopt the most cautious attitude in their business. Those who have no restrictions on credit loans for their business should be especially careful to build up their strength. At the same time, they should find ways to provide safety guarantees for depositors from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Grain Trade Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Suspension of Foreign Rice Mortgage by Silver and Money Trades</p>
<p>*Da Gong News Agency:* The various banks in Shanghai, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and the money trade are planning to suspend foreign rice mortgage because rice merchants have ordered more than six million packages of foreign rice, in order to avoid financial risks. The Grain Trade Association has received reports from colleagues for several days in a row. Therefore, it held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 people, including Chen Ziyi, Yang Heqing, Fu Changyu, Cai Yukun, Zhu Zixiang, and Yan Xiaoquan, attended. Chairman Gu Xinyi reported the purpose of the meeting and then began the discussion. It was resolved to assign Gu Xinyi and Yang Heqing to be responsible for explaining to Zhang Gongquan, the general manager of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin, the general manager of the Bank of Communications, Li Fusun, the general manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Qin Runqing, the leader of the money trade.</p>

However, the Soviet ship "North" has not finished loading, so it cannot depart today. It will be changed to tomorrow, still taking the original ship, along with many artists such as Mei Lanfang, to leave Shanghai and go abroad.

<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Long-Distance Telephone</h3>
<p>Guangdong Sends Commissioner to Shanghai to Negotiate</p>
<p>*Hua Dong News Agency:* Deng Zong, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Automatic Telephone Management Committee and director of the Guangzhou Telephone Bureau, was ordered by the provincial government to come to Shanghai by boat the other day to discuss the implementation of long-distance telephone service between Shanghai and Guangdong with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the International Trade Bureau, and to count the various application materials transported from England to Shanghai, preparing to escort them back to Guangdong for installation in the coming days. It is reported that this telephone is expected to have an informal call on March 15. The Hua Dong News Agency reporter is specially reporting the details as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Has Been Four Months</p>
<p>In order to communicate news between Shanghai and Guangdong and to prosper the commercial situation in the two places, the Ministry of Communications decided to build a long-distance wireless telephone between Shanghai and Guangdong in October last year. After negotiating a joint venture plan with the Guangdong Provincial Government, Guangdong once sent Mr. Deng to Shanghai to negotiate. After the various methods were decided, the China Electric Company contracted all the projects. One party sent personnel to England in early December last year to purchase all the necessary machinery and materials.</p>
<p>Mr. Deng Comes to Shanghai Again</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications has purchased all the materials from England and transported them to Shanghai, the Guangdong Provincial Government has sent Deng to Shanghai again to count the various materials used by Guangdong and escort them back to Guangdong for installation. Mr. Deng arrived the other day and immediately went to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the International Telecommunications Bureau and other agencies to contact the handover matters. He also inspected the progress of the general station project in Shanghai. According to the reporter, in addition to the above two matters, he also discussed with the Telephone Bureau the time and fees for sending and receiving reports after the call, and plans to go to Beijing to meet with Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Communications, to ask for instructions on everything. It will take about three or four days to complete the matter and escort the materials back to the province.</p>
<p>Location of General Station on Both Sides</p>
<p>All the machinery purchased from England by the Ministry of Communications has been transported to Shanghai, totaling more than 100 pieces. The part belonging to Shanghai has been transferred by the International Telecommunications Bureau to be installed near the Zhenru Radio Station, and the machine room of the Shanghai-Guangdong long-distance telephone general station will be built there. Construction began a few days ago. The machine room of the Guangdong general station will be set up in the province's Shibei, and the office will be attached to the automatic telephone office. After Deng escorts all the materials back to Guangdong, the China Electric Company will send engineer Xue Bage to Guangdong to step up construction.</p>
<p>Call in Mid-Next Month</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency, this telephone has been scheduled to make an informal call on March 15. The newspaper reported a few days ago that the call will be made on March 1, but it is feared that the time is still impossible. Even the call on March 15 is a trial call. The official business will be extended to April 1. It is also reported that the total construction cost and material cost of this Shanghai-Guangdong telephone is 700,000 yuan, which is borne equally by the Ministry of Communications and the Guangdong Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Doihara’s Argument Full of Sino-Japanese Friendship</h3>
<p>*New Sound News Agency:* Lieutenant General Kenji Doihara, the head of the Special Service Agency of the Kwantung Army of Japan, entered the customs from Liaoning this time, passed through Qingdao, and came to Shanghai with Mantietsu consultant Sadaichi Oyama. His every move has attracted attention from the outside. According to Japanese newspapers, Doihara visited Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Huang Fu, the chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, in the mornings of the other day at 10:00 and 11:00 respectively. Yesterday morning, he also visited Huang Fu and Zhang Gongquan, the general manager of the Bank of China, and discussed matters. At about 11:00 in the evening, he and Oyama took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing to visit various authorities of our government. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 24th of this month, and then return to the Northeast. Before leaving Shanghai, Doihara met with Western reporters at about 9:00 AM yesterday. He said that Sino-Japanese relations have gradually improved recently, but have not yet reached the point of complete friendship. He believes that it is necessary for China and Japan to support each other, because the relationship between the two countries is very close geographically and ethnically. However, there are still some minor obstacles, and if these obstacles can be removed, the goal of friendship can be achieved. These minor obstacles are the different views between China and Japan, but they are not difficult to eliminate. Therefore, he believes that Sino-Japanese friendship is ultimately possible.</p>

<h3>Representatives from Zhide County Go to the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee to Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>Representatives from Zhide, Anhui Province, and others came to the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee on Renji Road yesterday and presented a letter from the county's Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee, which is transcribed as follows: Since last year, Zhide has suffered from two disasters of bandits and drought in succession. The starving people are everywhere, and the dead are lying on top of each other. Those who have a little bit of humanity are all heartbroken by what they see and think about hunger and drowning. In recent months, we have received relief from various parties, but it is ultimately a drop in the bucket and difficult to sustain. The spring famine is approaching, and disaster is imminent. The number of victims is more than 80,000. Some families have committed suicide together, and some old and weak people have been abandoned in ditches. Even those who have survived are barely breathing and on the verge of death. Looking ahead, we are deeply worried about collapse. If we do not exhaust our human resources to save the hearts of heaven, how can we extend a lifeline of crisis and save dying lives? Currently, Master Hongsan, the director of the Anhui Righteous Relief Investigation and Release, and Deputy Directors Zhang Gongze Pu and Xu Gongpinxuan are running multiple non-fire porridge factories in the most difficult areas of Zhide. The details are recorded in the fundraising announcement and do not need to be repeated. However, Zhang Gongze Pu did not hesitate to trek to the disaster area to carry out the investigation and release in person. After seeing the situation, he was deeply sympathetic. The committee has now publicly elected four representatives, Hong Mianzhi, Cao Wanxuan, Lin Yaoting, and Chen Ruisong, to accompany Director Zhang to Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Ping and other places to raise grain and funds for long-term relief. It is heard that the committee is exhausting its resources to cope with the situation, and is still sparing no effort to carry out the solicitation of spring relief. It is hoped that all circles will know about the eagerness of Qiupu to be relieved and quickly provide assistance so that these 80,000 starving people will not fill the ditches.</p>
<h3>Debt and Contracts of the Old Electrical Administration Are Subject to Auditing</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Hires Lixin Accountants to Audit</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the old domestic and foreign debts owed by the Electrical Administration amount to 6.6 million yuan, most of which were borrowed during the Beijing government era, and there is no definite repayment plan, the Ministry of Communications is in urgent need of rectification and repayment to maintain credit. It should negotiate with various creditors to reduce the amount of debt, lower the interest rate, and repay in installments, and new contracts have been signed separately. All the details have been recorded in previous reports. The Ministry, in order to gain the trust of Chinese and foreign parties, has entrusted Accountant Pan Xulun, the director of the Lixin Accounting Firm in Shanghai, to audit the disaster relief list and the new and old contracts with British Accountant Ke Zuoshi in order to verify the audit. Accountant Pan led his assistant accountant to Beijing on the 14th of this month to verify the documents. He only returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing the task. According to Accountant Pan, the cleaning up of the debt situation, the debts owed by the Ministry, the lists sent to the Ministry, the registration book and related documents have been inspected and checked by the audit. The Ministry of Communication and the creditors had signed, and the number of items to be repaid are all accurate. The Ministry of Transportation will announce these, so the public can be confident once the document has been signed.</p>

<h3>The Hai Zhen Vessel Damaged the Hai Xiang Vessel Upon Entering Port</h3>
<p>Caused by Tidal Conditions</p>
<p>Reversing Was to No Avail</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new vessel Hai Zhen, on its return to Shanghai from Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, damaged the Hai Xiang vessel at the Jinliyuan Wharf when entering port. The extent of the damage is not very significant, and the Hai Xiang can still depart as usual. The details of the incident are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Turning Around Led to the Accident</p>
<p>After entering port at 10:30 a.m. on the 17th, the Hai Zhen vessel was heading to the Jinliyuan Wharf at No. 16, South City, to dock. When the ship reached the river surface in front of the Xin Jiangtian Wharf, the captain of the Hai Zhen, Hu Zhaoyuan, turned the ship around. At this time, the Hai Zhen vessel could pass through the river channels of Ning Shao and Jiangtian when turning around. Hu Zhaoyuan was quite capable in navigation. Unexpectedly, as the ship turned upright, due to tidal conditions, the Hai Zhen's hull moved forward rapidly. At that time, the Hai Xiang vessel was moored at Pier No. 3, loading cargo. Hu Zhaoyuan saw that the Hai Zhen was about to collide with the Hai Xiang and that the momentum was extremely strong. The captain of the Hu vessel immediately stopped the engine but still could not stop the ship from moving forward. He urgently ordered the ship to reverse while dropping two anchors, but still failed to stop the ship. However, the forward momentum was greatly reduced, so although it crashed into the Hai Xiang, the damage was mitigated.</p>
<p>Both Vessels Damaged</p>
<p>The Hai Xiang vessel was tied to the dock with three steel wire ropes and was loading cargo, so it could not avoid the collision. If the Hai Zhen had not reversed and dropped two anchors, the Hai Xiang vessel would have been half-destroyed by the Hai Zhen. At the time when the bow of the Hai Zhen crashed into the stern of the Hai Xiang, the reversing force of the Hai Zhen had already been exerted, so the platform railings and steel plates on the stern of the Hai Xiang were completely destroyed by the Hai Zhen. The three steel wire ropes connecting to the shore were also broken. The steel plate at the bow of the Hai Zhen vessel was also dented. After the accident, the captains of the two vessels reported the details to the head office, requesting them to send personnel to the ships for inspection. The chief shipowner Shen Jiyun and the head of the shipping department personally went to inspect.</p>
<p>Report Requesting Inspection</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bureau had informed the insurance companies insuring the two vessels against marine accidents of the details of the collision between the two ships, based on the reports of the two shipowners, Hu Xiyuan and Rex. Hai Xiang was insured by Zhaotai and others, and Hai Zhen was insured by the Yangzi Insurance Company. After inspection by the Chinese merchant insurance firm yesterday, it was determined that since Hai Xiang was hit by Hai Zhen, the responsibility should fall on Hai Zhen. All losses of Hai Xiang will be borne by Hai Zhen's insurance firm. The total loss from the collision of the two ships, although not known in detail, is roughly around four to five thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Normal Departure After the incident, the captain of the Hai Zhen vessel, Hu Xiyuan, angrily submitted his resignation to the head office yesterday, saying that if his order to reverse had been followed, the accident might not have occurred. The bureau, because the damage to the Hai Xiang was fortunately above the platform and did not affect navigation, still ordered the vessel to depart as usual and repair it after it returned to Shanghai on its next shift. As for the damaged steel plate at the bow of the Hai Zhen vessel, it was decided by the bureau yesterday that repairs could be postponed, so it was still ordered to be exported on schedule.</p>
<h3>Judgments and Punishments in Two Gambling Cases in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Wang Jiaxin Attempts to Escape Out of Fear of Punishment</p>
<p>Falls and Injures Vital Parts, Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Dadong Hotel</p>
<p>You A'gen, the chief Chinese detective of the Laozha Police Station, learned that someone was gathering people to gamble on Pai Gow in room 213 of the Dadong Hotel on Yinghua Street, profiting by skimming off the top. He ordered detectives Pang Ruiqing, He Xiaozhi, and the Western detective Mei Sheng to secretly investigate and arrest them the night before last. Upon arriving at the room, the group of gamblers, realizing that things were not going well, fled outwards in all directions, numbering about sixty to seventy people. Because there were not many detectives, the police only managed to detain Xie Lao Si, Xu Mao Di, Xu Shiwen, Wang Lao Wu, Wang Hongjin, Wang Silong, Hu Xiaodi, Xu Shaoshan, Li Lao Si, Zhang Mujin, Yao Shisheng, Xu Gongshi, and twelve others on the spot. Pai Gow tiles, dice, chips, etc. were confiscated and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court, where the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a lawsuit according to law, stating that defendant Xie Lao Si had committed another crime, requesting a postponement. The others were asked to be judged according to law. Judge Zhan Liangce questioned each defendant one by one and sentenced Xu Mao Di and the other eleven to a fine of thirty yuan each for gambling. The gambling equipment was confiscated, and Xie Lao Si was held over for rescheduling next Saturday.</p>
<p>Inside a Customs Brokerage</p>
<p>Also, Kang Zengxiang and Bao Zhen, Chinese detectives of the General Police Station, learned that someone was gathering people to gamble in the Yuanshuncheng firm on the third floor of the Yishunsheng Customs Brokerage at No. 6, Lane 135, Jiangxi Road, profiting by skimming off the top. They secretly went to the address to arrest them at 11:15 p.m. the night before last. Unexpectedly, there were more than a hundred gamblers in the room. Upon seeing the detectives, they panicked and fled. On the spot, in addition to detaining Qi Zhili, Qu Shengsun, Xin Dequan, Li Tianzhi, Wu Zhenshan, Lin Ruhao, Sun Jizhen, Bai Quanshun, Weng Hongjiu, and nine others, there was also the young boss of the firm, Wang Jiaxin (22 years old), a native of Shandong. While climbing out of the window to escape, he lost his footing due to panic and fell from the third floor, injuring his vital parts. He was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance, but due to internal injuries, treatment was ineffective, and he died at around 3:00 a.m. yesterday. The body was sent to the Feilun Road morgue to await examination. The remaining nine criminals were taken to the police station along with gambling and smoking paraphernalia. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. After questioning by Judge Zhan, Qu Shengsun was sentenced to concurrent punishments for smoking and gambling, with a fine of forty yuan. The remaining eight were fined twenty yuan each. The gambling equipment, etc., was confiscated. Prosecutor Tang of the Prosecutor's Office and the forensic doctor drove to the morgue to examine the body, confirming that Wang Jiaxin had fallen to his death before his death. The body was handed over to his wife, Wang Li, for burial.</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Embezzlement Case of a Bank Employee of the Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>Xu Jianhou Sentenced to One Year and Fined Three Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Xu Jianhou, a native of Dantu, Jiangsu, who worked as a banknote counter at the Bank of Communications at No. 7 on the Bund, embezzled banknotes worth 22,800 yuan under the pretext of his position, starting on May 17th of last year, and fled. After the Bank of Communications found out, it reported it to the General Police Station and requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. At around 9:00 a.m. on January 17th of this year, detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Xu within their jurisdiction and transferred him to the Public Concession Police Station. The Bureau of Works lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution against him for business embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. The details of the interrogation have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court, ascended the Criminal Tribunal No. 1 and announced the judgment. Xu Jianhou was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for embezzling property held in the course of business and fined three hundred yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was equivalent to one day of imprisonment for every two days. If the fine is converted to imprisonment, it will be calculated at two yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Camphor and Other Goods are Needed in India and Other Places</h3>
<p>Waste Fluff is Needed in Canada</p>
<p>Bean Flour is Needed in Honolulu</p>
<p>Camphor is a specialty of Taiwan. It is also produced in large quantities in Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces, and is exported annually. It is an essential raw material for the manufacture of smokeless gunpowder and has wide applications in medicine due to its effective antiseptic properties. After the influenza epidemic swept through the Americas in 1918, injecting camphor into patients' serum was highly effective. Pharmaceutical factories then recognized camphor as an important raw material for manufacturing diphtheria vaccines. Silk is an indispensable raw material for the manufacture of velvet products in tropical regions because it is light, thin, beautiful, and aesthetically pleasing. The Bombay Union Import and Export Company of India has sent a letter requesting the above two items. It is hoped that exporters will write to the bureau's guidance office for introductions. The waste fluff stripped from cotton is used to fill mattresses and pillows. Currently, the Upper Southern Chemical Company of Canada needs this item. A letter from Honolulu requests the introduction of exporters who can supply 100 tons of bean flour per month. The Southern Fireworks Company of the United States needs various firecrackers. Experienced exporters can write to the bureau for introductions. The address is on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building under the New Rubbish Bridge.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Fire on Dengtuo Road: Six Deaths</h3>
<p>Three Men, Two Women, and One Child</p>
<p>Two Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Tang Heng, a 30-year-old man from Chongming, worked as a laborer pulling rickshaws. He lived at No. 38 1/2, Zaifu Lane, Dengtuo Road, Tangshan Road, Shanghai East. It is noted that most of the houses in this lane are single-story buildings, and the tenants are mostly common people. Therefore, each house often has six or seven families renting it. The attic, the pavilion room, and even under the stairs are full of noisy and filthy residents. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in No. 28 1/2. At that time, the residents were fast asleep and had not yet woken up. By the time they were alarmed, the fire had already spread. They struggled to carry their elderly and young, fleeing in all directions. But at that time, the fire had already spread to the adjacent No. 27 and No. 29 1/2, causing a great commotion. Fortunately, the fire brigade received the news and rushed fire trucks to put out the fire. However, the fire was raging and was not easy to extinguish for a while, and the location was narrow, making it difficult to spray water. It was not until around 6:00 a.m. that the fire gradually died down. As a result, No. 28 1/2 was completely destroyed in the fire, and the left and right neighbors were also burned down for the most part. It was discovered that several people had not escaped the fire pit. The fire brigade dug through the rubble until the afternoon. Two people were seriously injured: (1) Tang Heng, (2) Shou Guirong, 39 years old, from Anhui, also worked as a rickshaw puller, and his whole body was burned. They were sent to Tongren Hospital by ambulance for treatment. There were also six men and women who were burned to death because they could not escape. When they were dug out, they were charred black, and the stench was terrible. Their faces were blurred and difficult to identify. Later, after careful examination by neighbors, it was recognized that there were three male corpses, two female corpses, and one child corpse, all of whom lived in No. 28. They were temporarily covered with reed mats, pending a report to the court for inspection. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Collision of Two Sandboats Outside Wusong Estuary: Fourteen Drowned</h3>
<p>Darkness Made Rescue Difficult</p>
<p>At around 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the sandboats Zhang Yuantai and Jiang Anyu collided in the eastern sea area outside Wusong Estuary. The Zhang Yuantai capsized immediately, and all seventeen members of the crew fell into the water. The bow of the Jiang Anyu was also damaged. Three boatmen were knocked into the water and were stopped to rescue them. Due to the strong wind and waves, the rescue was difficult. Only two of the crew and four of the Zhang boat's crew were rescued. The rest could not be rescued and have already been drowned in the darkness.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Floods Violently</h3>
<p>Rising More Than Ten Feet in a Decade</p>
<p>Breaking the Upstream Flood Record</p>
<p>The Yangtze River's water level usually rises in mid-March, so the shipping companies' shallow water fee cancellation period is set for March 16th. This year, the Yangtze River's shallow water period lasted only a week, which is rare in history. After the 10th of this month, unexpectedly, the upstream river water rose even more wildly starting from the 17th. As of yesterday, the shipping companies in this port received telegrams from Hankou, stating that from Hankou to Jiujiang, the river water had risen to 20 feet and one inch since the 17th. From Jiujiang to Wuhu, the river water had risen even more to 22 feet and seven inches, an increase of more than eleven feet compared to before the 10th. The water level is still rising wildly. According to people in the shipping industry, this year's Yangtze River flood is a month earlier than usual. If the current situation continues, the upstream water level may reach more than 30 feet by mid-March. This flood did not originate from the upper reaches of the Sichuan River. According to the crew members of the Yangtze River ships, it was caused by the outbreak of the Xiang River. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River are also continuing to rise, but regardless of the cause, the early timing of this year's Yangtze River flood and the huge increase in water level have broken the historical record for the same period in the Yangtze River. Now, Yangtze River ships can load as much cargo as possible, and after the flood, the shallow sandbars in the upper reaches that endanger the ships have been washed away, making navigation safer. However, the exposed beaches on the riverbank have been submerged, making navigation more difficult.</p>
<h3>Marriage Disputes and Extortion from Matchmakers</h3>
<p>A Foreman Resembles a Police Detective</p>
<p>Matchmaker Chen Meilong Suffers</p>
<p>Wu Shimei, a native of Ningbo, had a son named Zuo Yao, who worked on a ship. In February of the year before last, Chen Meilong, also from Ningbo, and a woman named Wang Rong acted as matchmakers, arranging for his son to marry a woman with the surname Wang. The betrothal gift was forty-eight yuan, and a gold ring and a gold bracelet were eighty-six yuan. The marriage contract was complete. Unexpectedly, the son committed a crime in April and was sentenced to seven years in prison. The other party was not informed. Last winter, the woman's parents asked the matchmaker to urge Wu Shimei to set a date for the wedding. Wu hastily claimed that his son was on a foreign ship and did not know when he would return home, so they would discuss it later. Later, the woman's family asked Meilong to continue asking. Wu had no way to refuse and discussed with Chen whether he could say that his son had died and ask for the return of the betrothal gift to cancel the marriage. This plan was heard by the other party, who interfered with the two matchmakers and betrothed the woman to someone else. Wu learned of this and, at around 1:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, invited the male matchmaker Wang Rong and fellow villagers Chen Hongbing and Yan A'gen to the Hongkou Hotel on North Sichuan Road, Room 23, to negotiate. He asked them to pay the woman's family 160 yuan to settle the matter, otherwise, they would be sent to the police station for colluding to commit fraud and divide the betrothal gift. Chen Hongbing was a foreman of road construction, wearing a Western suit and leather shoes, and looked like a police detective. Yan A'gen was wearing a Zhongshan suit and was a detective in the Public Security Bureau. He threatened Chen Meilong, demanding that he be responsible for paying twice the amount of the betrothal gift and keeping him under surveillance to prevent him from escaping. Chen pleaded to go home to find a way to get the money, but was initially refused. Later, they hired a car and drove to the door of his house in Xiaoshadu. They did not allow him to enter the house and told his wife, Jin, and his brother, Chen Xue, to bring the money to Room 23 of the hotel. After speaking, they drove back and continued to monitor his actions. At around 2:00 a.m., his brother Chen Xue and his wife Jin reported to the Hongkou Police Station. The Chinese detective Wang Guangqi and the Western detective rushed to the address and arrested Wu Shimei and the other four men and women in the room, rescuing Chen Meilong. They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. The Bureau of Works lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above and asked for an investigation. The court presented the marriage contract and a paper, and Chen Meilong testified to the events. The defendants stammered in their statements. Judge Wu Han ordered them to be detained separately and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Case of Kuang Yefu v. Zhang Weiru</h3>
<p>The Private Prosecution and the Attached Civil Suit Are Both Rejected</p>
<p>Zhang Weiru, the chairman of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, and the executive directors Yin Yunsheng and Shen Changgeng were found by the shareholder Kuang Yefu from Guangdong to have colluded with each other and embezzled huge amounts of money. He hired lawyer Wang Jian to file a criminal private prosecution against Zhang and others in the First Special District Court, listing five charges of fraud, totaling more than 560,000 yuan. He requested that they be punished according to law and that Zhang, Yin, and Shen be ordered to jointly repay the money. Judge Jiang Shuzi summoned the defendants to trial, and the defense lawyers Wu Linkun, Wang Fuchang, and Zhang Shizhao argued that the plaintiff was not allowed to file a private prosecution according to law and demanded that the suit be dismissed. Judge Jiang ordered the lawyers from both sides to first debate the issue of the litigation procedure. The arguments of both parties have been detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the ruling on whether a private prosecution could be filed. In the afternoon, at 2:00 p.m., the plaintiff's lawyer Wang Jian and the defendant's defense lawyers Wu Linkun and Cai Guangxu arrived in court one after another, while only Shen Changgeng, one of the parties, arrived. Judge Jiang immediately ascended the seat and announced the ruling, stating that the private prosecution and the attached civil suit were both rejected. After the court, when asked for his opinion, lawyer Wang Jian said that the plaintiff could not accept this ruling and would appeal to a higher court according to law in order to seek relief.</p>
<h3>Ignorant People Setting Off Sky Lanterns: Two False Alarms in Sanxin Lane</h3>
<p>Quick Response Prevents Disaster</p>
<p>The French Police Are Paying Special Attention</p>
<p>At around 9:00 p.m. on both the previous and the day before yesterday, there were two fires in Sanxin Lane No. 104 and No. 234 in the French Concession, thankfully without causing disaster. After a detailed investigation of the cause of the fire, it was determined that they were all caused by ignorant people setting off sky lanterns. The direction of the lanterns came entirely from the Chinese area of Nanshi. The French police are paying special attention and have ordered all detectives to pay attention at all times.</p>
<h3>Assault Case Involving a United Film Director During a Basketball Game</h3>
<p>Attempting to Enter Without Buying a Ticket, Zhao Tianpeng Forcibly Stopped Them</p>
<p>Displaying Ferocious Flames, Director Wu's Actions Were Unreasonable and Barbaric</p>
<p>—Arrested and Jailed, Aware of His Wrongdoing, He Compensated Medical Expenses and Reached a Settlement Yesterday—</p>
<p>The Peking Fu Jen Catholic University basketball team came to Shanghai during the winter vacation to compete. A "Unnamed Basketball Team," organized by employees of the Shanghai Lianhua Film Company, challenged Fu Jen. They agreed to hold a match on the evening of the 26th of last month at the Shenyuan Basketball Hall on Yanping Road. Before the game started, a large number of cheerleaders entered the arena, and more were arriving, also wanting to enter the arena without tickets. At that time, Zhao Tianpeng, the accounting director of the Chinese National Sports Association, was monitoring ticket collection at the entrance. Zhao is the nephew of Zhao Jinqing, a director of the Sports Association. Seeing this, he stopped them, believing that free admission was not allowed. Zhao acted impartially, but unexpectedly, disaster struck.</p>
<p>Beating People Instead of Buying Tickets</p>
<p>Jin Yan, the captain of the Unnamed Team and a movie star, came forward to intercede. Officials of the Sports Association mediated, saying that they must buy a certain number of tickets, regardless of the number of people. However, Jin Yan's attitude was also very firm. Zhao, in order to be loyal to his duties, did not give in, saying that no one without a ticket would be allowed to enter the arena. As they were deadlocked, a hand suddenly came out from the cheerleaders outside the arena and slapped Zhao Tianpeng twice on the face, followed by two punches to the waist. Zhao's left cheek immediately became red and swollen.</p>
<p>Police Chase and Arrest</p>
<p>The Sports Association staff were outnumbered and helpless, so they called the Gordon Road Police Station and the Caojiadu Sixth District Public Security Bureau. After the perpetrators committed the crime, they swaggered away. When the detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station arrived, the perpetrators had already headed towards Yanping Road. The detectives chased and arrested the perpetrators. Since the location belonged to the Sixth District, they were handed over to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Pleading for Compensation and Apologies</p>
<p>That night's game was canceled because of this, and the audience refunded their tickets, creating chaos. The order of other Shanghai Basketball Association games was also disrupted. After the perpetrators were detained at the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, the police chief interrogated them. At first, the perpetrators tried to deny it, but later fully admitted it. When asked for his name, it turned out to be Wu Yonggang, the director of the Lianhua Film Company's "Goddess" movie. At the same time, Zhao Tianpeng also obtained injury reports from Tongren and Red Cross hospitals and submitted them to the Sixth District. Wu Yonggang admitted his wrongdoing and was detained. That night, officials from the Lianhua Film Company heard the news and tried to mediate. Wu Yonggang also knew that he was in the wrong and pleaded to apologize to Zhao Tianpeng. Zhao, seeing that Wu was remorseful, expressed his permission. The Lianhua Film Company posted bail for his release.</p>
<p>Compensation, Medical Expenses, and Settlement</p>
<p>Both parties then negotiated a settlement, with Jin Yan acting as the mediator. He asked Shen Siliang, the general secretary of the Sports Association, and Zhou Jiaqi, the secretary, to mediate. The Sports Association also expressed its willingness to compensate for the losses incurred that night. After several discussions on medical and other expenses, Wu Yonggang compensated Zhao Tianpeng 90 yuan. Both parties reached a settlement yesterday, and Zhao Tianpeng notified the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. This unreasonable assault case involving a director finally came to an end.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Shanghai Theatre</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Theatre, initiated by Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, and well-known figures in the spoken drama circles such as Xu Banmei and Chen Dabei, is said to have been organized and completed. The theatre has a training institute with a six-month graduation period. Pan Gongzhan has been publicly elected as the director, and Chen Dabei as the deputy director. It is also heard that the institute will start advertising for enrollment from today, and Wang Shaoqing, the institute's technical director, is in charge of this matter and is extremely strict. In order to prevent favoritism, an examination committee has been organized, with Song Chunfang, Xu Banmei, Chen Gexin, and others as members.</p>
<h3>Hua Zhongchu, the Protagonist of the Huge Embezzlement Case of Over 40,000 Yuan, to Arrive Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Two Beautiful Prostitutes Implicated Due to Association with the Wrong Person</p>
<p>Stolen Money Amounting to 30,000 Yuan Already Recovered in Hong Kong Port</p>
<p>Hua Zhongchu, an employee of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, cleverly embezzled over 40,000 yuan in silver from the bank. He then fled to Hong Kong with two prostitutes. The bank discovered this and urgently telegraphed Hong Kong to intercept Hua. According to sources from the China Eastern News Agency yesterday morning, the Public Concession Police in Shanghai have dispatched detectives to escort Hua back to Shanghai. He is expected to arrive the day after tomorrow. The two prostitutes were also arrested and will face legal sanctions upon arrival in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>After embezzling over 40,000 yuan on the evening of the 12th, Hua Zhongchu boarded the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Company the next morning. He took with him two prostitutes, the third daughter of Yinghong's family in the Huile Lane, and fled together. The Agricultural and Industrial Bank discovered this very early and reported it to the police, who then requested the Hong Kong police authorities to intercept them. When the Dollar liner arrived in Hong Kong, Hua and the two women were successfully captured. The Public Concession Police in Shanghai have now dispatched Detective Chief Zhang Minde, leading detectives to Hong Kong to escort Hua and the two women back to Shanghai on the Hesheng Wheel. They are scheduled to arrive tomorrow.</p>
<p>Stolen Money Recovered</p>
<p>This embezzlement from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank amounted to over 40,000 yuan. When Hua fled to Hong Kong, due to the sudden rush, he only deposited part of the stolen money elsewhere. The rest was kept on his person. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong police searched him at the pier and found 30,000 yuan in stolen silver, all in new ten-yuan notes. This immediately aroused suspicion among the Hong Kong police, leading to the cracking of the case. The whereabouts of the remaining 10,000 yuan are currently unknown and will only be revealed after Hua returns to Shanghai for questioning.</p>
<p>Detailed Account of the Incident</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the China Eastern News Agency reporter obtained a detailed account of the incident from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank and other sources. The main perpetrator, Hua Zhongchu, is from Wuxi and only 22 years old. He is usually very intelligent and knows how to please people, which earned him the trust of the bank authorities. However, Hua made bad friends and indulged in the glamorous and decadent life of the "ten-mile foreign concessions." He engaged in wild prostitution and gambling, stopping at nothing. Later, he met Yinghong's second and third daughters, the prostitutes of the Huile Lane. He was stunned by their beauty and became immersed in their world. Over time, he began to show signs of financial strain. Hua initially resorted to borrowing from the future to cover present expenses, but eventually ran out of money and was unable to find a solution. He then resorted to this desperate measure. He planned it carefully beforehand. On the night of the 12th of this month, he cut white paper into the shape of banknotes and used the "steal the beams and pillars and replace them with rotten wood" method to embezzle over 40,000 yuan in silver at once. The next morning, he took the two prostitutes and bought tickets to Hong Kong. Beforehand, the two women were also seduced by Hua. Seeing Hua's lavish spending and elegant demeanor, they believed him to be a wealthy young man, unaware that he was a mere bank clerk. They were willing to follow the story of the English Emperor. Hua also believed that the bank had many banknotes and that he would not be discovered for some time, allowing him to live freely after arriving in Hong Kong. However, he was discovered the very next day and the police were immediately notified. Under the investigation of the police, it was learned that Hua had gone to Hong Kong and the Hong Kong police were entrusted to arrest him. The Agricultural and Industrial Bank deeply regrets Hua's straying from the right path and making such a big mistake.</p>

<h3>Woman Wang Yulan Sues College Student for Embezzlement and Offenses Against Morality</h3>
<p>Demanding the Return of Embezzled Items and 20,000 Yuan in Solatium</p>
<p>Defendant Claims Wang Yulan Was Originally a Woman of the Brothel</p>
<p>Wang Yulan, a 23-year-old woman from Tianjin residing at No. 5, Pingle Lane, 330 Xizang Road, recently engaged a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. She accused Sun Shanfu (currently 26 years old), a local resident studying at a certain university and residing at No. 50, Wende Lane, Hartung Road, of embezzlement of jewelry and offenses against morality. Yesterday afternoon, this case was heard by Judge Liu Yugui in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant did not appear, and lawyer Chao Kun acted as his representative. According to the plaintiff, Wang Yulan's statement to the court, "I have been lonely since childhood, losing my father early and living with my mother. In March of the 22nd year of the Republic, I met the defendant, Sun Shanfu, in the Dazhong Lane of Tongfu Road. At that time, the defendant claimed to be a student of my father and said that they knew each other, so we started talking and gradually became intimate. Unexpectedly, Sun had evil intentions and flattered me with sweet words, saying that he had been widowed for a long time and wanted to marry me as his second wife, and boasted about how rich his property was and how comfortable his life was. I was young and inexperienced, and mistakenly thought Sun was a lifelong partner. In July of that year, I discussed marriage with him. Sun gave me a gold lock pendant and we took a photo together as evidence of our engagement, and stated that the wedding would be held soon. But Sun, seeing that his plan had succeeded, went further and made all kinds of requests, until I was confused and was raped at the Dazhonghua Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Xizang Road. Afterwards, we lived together in the upstairs of the tailor shop at No. 7, Fuzhili, Guangxi Road, for about five months, and then moved to No. 5, Pingle Lane, Xizang Road. Since then, I have repeatedly urged him to fulfill the marriage contract, but Sun made excuses and procrastinated. At this point, I became suspicious and began to investigate. I found out that the defendant already had a wife and children, and that all his sweet words were just deceit. It was like waking up from a big dream, regretting the damage to my reputation and feeling remorse for the rest of my life. It is truly regrettable. Not only that, but when my father was alive, he served as a professor at various universities, and his income from tuition fees was slightly saved. He treated me like a pearl in his hand, so he bought me many pieces of jewelry. After living with the defendant, he used deceptive words to coax me, on the grounds of keeping it in a safe deposit box, and made me hand over ten gold rings, a pearl flower, two gold bracelets, a gold chain bracelet, and the gold lock pendant from our engagement. On the one hand, the defendant gave me a seal, saying that I could use it to take the items, but in fact, the defendant was saving them in name only, but in reality, he was seizing them. After that, he was tricked out of the photo with sweet words and never came back. I hate to lose my purity, and I also regret the loss of my property. With such behavior, the defendant committed crimes under Articles 356 and 244 of the Criminal Law and should be severely punished according to the law. Please order him to return the embezzled items worth 2,500 yuan and compensate me for the mental distress with a solatium of 20,000 yuan." The defendant stated that in August of the 22nd year, they met at the New World Amusement Park. At that time, they were on good terms, and there was a feeling of regret for meeting so late. After the plaintiff entered the Lulanchun brothel on Shantou Road, the defendant went to support her and toasted her wine almost every night. Therefore, the act of going to Sangjian and Pushang was unavoidable. Taking photos together also happened because their love was strong at the time. During this year, the plaintiff changed brothels frequently (commonly known as "changing heads"), such as Fuxiang Lane, Rongfang, Sanyuanfang, Fachun, Fuxiang Lane, Miaoling, and other places. Therefore, if the plaintiff is a virgin, there may be talk of offenses against morality. If she is a prostitute, it would violate the ministry's order. Now, I request that the case be postponed and that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Flower Donation Office be investigated. Because when applying for a license, a photo of the person must be taken, so there is no way to deny it. Judge Liu asked the plaintiff whether she was a prostitute, and Wang Yulan denied it, only saying that there were some little sisters such as Sanyuan in the brothel who she knew. The court ordered the case to be postponed to the afternoon of the 26th of this month and summoned the defendant to appear in court for further questioning.</p>

According to Chen Zhengfan, the editor in charge of the association, April 4th of this year is our country's Children's Day and the beginning of Children's Year. Its significance and far-reaching impact are beyond words. We, of course, express our warm celebration for this double celebration. All Chinese people (regardless of whether they are celebrities or scholars) who have essays, poems, dramas, novels, or paintings related to this celebration are welcome to contribute. Manuscripts with noble themes and rich interest will be provided to the Shen Bao, Xin Bao, Chen Bao, and Shi Shi Xin Bao for publication.

<h3>Recent Developments at Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant</h3>
<p>The Benefits of Cooperation Between the Authorities and Technicians</p>
<p>Recently, there have been reports on the technological improvements at the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant. According to an interview with a key technician at the plant, there have indeed been significant technological advances in the past two years. Work efficiency and production have increased, and manufacturing costs have decreased, allowing the plant to stand firm amidst the dual attacks of foreign goods dumping and the domestic market downturn last year. However, this is the result of the cooperation of all technicians under the guidance of the plant authorities, and I dare not take the credit personally. As for the gentleman mentioned in the report, he worked in the plant for a while two years ago. Although he worked hard, he could not accept the guidance of the chief engineer and did not conduct systematic research, resulting in no results. Furthermore, a certain gentleman stayed in the United States for two months, sent by the factory, and his mission was to study electrolysis tanks, but he only made a superficial investigation and did not study his own mission. This is regrettable in terms of professional ethics.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Spring Tea Party</h3>
<p>The Lake Society of this city holds a monthly gathering to connect members and fellow villagers. The New Year's group worship and dinner in January was held on New Year's Day, and at the same time, a formal dress movement was launched, and there were entertainment performances. Yesterday was also the Spring Tea Party for February, and more than 200 villagers and members attended. Mr. Shen Tianxin, the chairman of the executive committee of the society, gave a speech, which said, "This month's regular meeting is the Spring Tea Party held today. According to the lunar calendar, it is the Lantern Festival. People all over the world love reunion. Our fellow villagers have always liked to do their own thing, and it is difficult to unite. Since the establishment of this society, fellow villagers have a place to gather, to worship together every year, and to have fun every month. Fellow villagers share the same relief during water and drought, and jointly maintain education for our fellow villagers, jointly guide fellow villagers' careers, jointly develop fellow villagers' industries, and jointly assist fellow villagers' public welfare. This is what is meant by sharing the same worries and joys. I hope fellow villagers will drink more and then participate in the Lantern riddles and entertainment arranged by the club members of our society, visitors will be welcome, and those who come will be able to eat and drink to their heart's content and enjoy themselves with their fellow villagers. I think fellow villagers will also agree with this intention." After that, they began to dine. The performances were by club members of the society, including Jiang Xuexuanzhu and Denglong Gezhu's Meilong Town, Shen Yigu, Cheng Yunqiu, Chen Benquan, and Chen Buqun's Luoma Lake, Li Hanchu's Buying a Horse, Niu Bokang and Wang Yadong's Sitting in the Palace, Shen Bifang and Zheng Rengui's Killing a Daughter-in-law, and Shen Tianxin, Bao Xiaodie, Bao Youdie, Tu Konglin, and Cui Tixian's New Picking Up Gold, all of which were extremely exciting. The New Picking Up Gold was the most popular and won the audience's applause. Everyone was very happy. The meeting ended at two o'clock.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press Holds a New Book Pre-Order Event</h3>
<p>University and Middle School Students in This City Enthusiastically Order</p>
<p>The Commercial Press, in order to reduce book prices and encourage reading, held a pre-order event for the "Sunrise" new books of the 24th year of the Republic to commemorate the third anniversary of the destruction of the General Factory. The conditions for students to pre-order new books are even more favorable than for ordinary people. They only need a certificate from the school they attend and pay a deposit of 15 yuan at one time to select new books published by the company this year at a 40% discount.

<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Implements Scientific Management</h3>
<p>Arousing the Organization to Promote National Products Business</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located across from the Hong Miao Temple on Nanjing Road, is the earliest established organization on Nanjing Road to promote national products. Recently, in view of the economic panic, commerce has followed the decline of industry, resulting in unprecedented impact. The company, as a self-defense measure, entrusted the China Statistics and Planning Society to study a plan for self-defense and business development. According to the research results of the planning society, the current serious state of commerce is actually an opportunity for China to reform its commercial organization and develop the national products business. According to the person in charge of the society, the commercial organization in China, in terms of its form, is actually a sales network for foreign goods, which has a great hindrance to the development of Chinese industry. Furthermore, by studying each commercial organization, it is felt that the economic organization and the personnel organization are not very sound. If these two organizations can be reformed and assisted, their capabilities can be increased to resist the attack of economic panic. Therefore, the society has agreed with the company's manager and deputy manager, Lu Qisheng and Wang Pingnan, to adopt Ren Jinpin's theory of business management and implement scientific management to increase the strength of the personnel organization. At present, the preliminary cost accounting has been formulated for each department of the entire company to promote the sense of responsibility of each service personnel, and the effect of business development can also be seen. In the society's view, it also wants to use this business development fact to arouse Chinese people to operate the national products business.</p>
<h3>Case of a Hengfeng Road Water Plant Petition Police Officer Being Stabbed by Thieves Already Transferred to the Third Section</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 22nd of November, multiple thieves used a small boat to cross the river to steal from the Zhabei Hengfeng Road North Bottom Water Plant. At that time, Bian Yulian, a petition police officer stationed at the Hengfeng Road Police Station, noticed them. The thieves dared to beat Bian brutally and stab him in the leg and abdomen with sharp blades. Later, the station chief, Lu Pei, reported to the Public Security Bureau based on intelligence, and the detective team leader, Lu Ying, supervised the Zhabei squad leader, Bao Ziying, and ordered them to solve the case within fifteen days. The other day, Mao Gongzhao, a detective at the station (Hengfeng Road Police Station), learned that the perpetrators of the case were hiding in Jinling Road, Hengfeng Road, Guangzhao Road, and other places, and reported to Station Chief Lu, who dispatched patrol sergeant Shen Yushan to join the detective squad leaders Dong Wenrui and Xie Qihua, and detectives Fang Chaofu, Sun Youzhi, and Gao Changgui, and others to successively capture six accomplices in the case, Qin Liangyin, Liu Jiqing, Xu Jingen, Fu Shouqian, Zhang Wenbin, and Wang Liancheng, on the previous two days. After being taken to the station, Qin Liangyin confessed, "I used to be a petition police officer at the water plant for seven or eight years. Because the company lost copper wires and other items when I was on duty, I was fired. Later, I met friends Zhang Wenbin, 'Big Rabbit' (i.e., Liu Jiqing), Xu Jingen, Fu Shouqian, Wang Liancheng, and others. They said that I was loyal and would avenge me. At that time, I took out twenty yuan to prepare to steal things from the company. Unexpectedly, the theft failed and we encountered the night watchman of the company, and they started fighting. Several people were injured at that time." Liu Jiqing confessed, "In December of the last lunar year, I met Lao Qin (Qin Liangyin) on Hengfeng Road. He told me about being fired. I said I would find a way for him." Xu Jingen, Fu Shouqian, Zhang Wenbin, Wang Liancheng, and others' confessions were similar to Qin and Liu's. After questioning and verifying the confessions, the interrogator transferred the thieves to the Zhabei branch of the Public Security Bureau's Third Section for disposition, as they had all confessed to theft.</p>

<p>When I come to this world from another world, there are many things I can't learn or teach. However, when it comes to eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, no matter how foolish or unintelligent you are, you don't need to learn or be taught; you can always play them perfectly. Is this a blessing left to us by our parents, or a surplus given to us by society?</p>
<h3>Memories of Spring Lanterns</h3>
<p>— Miao Yu</p>
<p>In past Spring Festivals, during leisure time, the young people in the neighborhood would always hang lanterns in the market during the Lantern Festival and enjoy guessing riddles together. Now, drifting at sea, living in solitude, there is no longer the joy of that time. So I recall a few clever ones from the past and describe them here, as a way of leaving a trace of remembrance.</p>
<p>How many people are in this situation? The riddles I wrote rarely used words from the Confucian classics. Good ones include "Zhu Mao" shooting a surname: "He Lian." "Mandarin ducks under the leaves dream a perfect circle" shooting a county name: "Heze." "Fingers complain of lack of energy" shooting an idiom: "Scratching an itch through boots." "Phoenix roosting" shooting a contemporary person (without a hat): "Sun Tonggang." "Is the beloved well?" shooting a contemporary person: "He Jian." "Parting at Yishui" shooting rhyme category four (minus numbers): "Cold River Heroic Song." "Dried fish" shooting rhyme category two (minus numbers): "Salt Fish." "Reduced imprisonment" shooting a Tang poem: "Crimes are all removed, from execution to death." "Bird's nest" shooting a Tang poem: "Smoke dissipates, the sun rises, no one is seen." "Arranging silk strings" shooting an ancient beauty (rolling up the curtain): "Qin Cao." "The land is narrow in Wu" shooting an ancient beauty: "Su Xiao," and so on, seemingly quite skillful.</p>
<p>Some riddles use the "double gate" format, which is very intricate and requires much thought. At that time, there were two such riddles: one was "Sweet rain" shooting rhyme category two (minus numbers): "Song Jiang." This is because "sweet rain" cuts to timely rain, and then to Song Jiang's nickname. The other was "Traveler's trunk damp" shooting a book title: "Golden Cabinet Synopsis." This is because "gold" cuts to "traveler." Although not exceptionally clever, the author put in a lot of effort. There was also Bai Yejun, a contemporary, who created the riddle "Private parts are clean and hairless" shooting his given name. This is because "ye" refers to the vulva, according to Shuowen. This is playful and abusive.</p>
<p>My friend Zhengyan once hung a riddle: "Zheng lost" shooting a medicine name, a fruit name, and a cigarette brand name each: (Xu Fei). In fact, they are all "Betel Nut." The wording is simple, and it should have been easy to guess, but the author deliberately created doubt, and many were helpless. When it was revealed, some praised the intricate thought, but in reality, it was adapted from the ancient riddle "Jade Ring."</p>
<p>Some riddles take store signs from the market, such as "Flower" shooting "Hua Tong." "Sun Yat-sen's spirit never dies" shooting "Sun Changsheng." "White hair still like a young man" shooting "Weng Changchun." "The division is resolved and the world is governed" shooting "He Xing." "Local scenery, only for a brief stop." Others use Liu Xiahui shooting "Sheng He." "Turtle head seal" shooting "Cai Xinyi," which seems slightly better, but this cleverness is only achieved with this ready-made riddle surface.</p>
<p>Riddles based on the six writing categories are quite difficult to create. For example, "Just before dusk" shooting "Ti." "Carrying a bamboo hat with remnants" shooting "Zhu." "From beginning to end, two are connected, yet no one else is seen" shooting "Sit." "Herbs and trees in the human world" shooting "Tea." "Half of a bamboo curtain at noon" shooting "Du." And so on, perhaps with some merit.</p>
<p>I have a doctor friend who creates riddles that mostly conceal items from the medicine cabinet. This is because he does not forget his original identity. I remember a few of the better ones, such as "Mugwort green and pomegranate red" shooting "Pinellia." "Thousands of gold are spent and never return" shooting "Loafers." "Temples like silk" shooting "Spotted fur." "Frequently looking up" shooting "Forsythia." These should not be criticized for being far-fetched.</p>
<h3>Firecrackers Upside Down</h3>
<h3>My Memories</h3>
<p>— Jin Shuyun</p>
<p>With a naive heart, without having gone through the repeated forging of this great social furnace, a young body and mind, now, I am asking myself, quite bravely, stepping into this dazzling great society, to be baptized by the storms of this society.</p>
<p>Recalling my past, I cannot help but feel quite emotional. No, this cannot be said to be emotional, but rather, it should be said to be a kind of review of my past.</p>
<p>I remember when I was about six or seven years old, I was fortunate enough to enter school. But because I didn't know that entering school was a blessing—how many children can't go to school—so even though I was in school, I didn't usually study hard. Therefore, my grades were failing. I suffered a lot of humiliation. As a result, I worked hard to improve, no longer just playing and completely forgetting my studies. In the year-end exam, I actually ranked first. This can be said to be the first lesson society taught me.</p>
<p>After six years of elementary school, I was fortunate enough to go to Shanghai and enter middle school. But unfortunately, my mother became ill, and there was no one at home to take care of her. I had no choice but to take a long leave of absence to take care of my mother. Later, my mother recovered, but my studies were also neglected. Soon, I rolled out of my family and into this society, becoming a speck of dust in this great social furnace.</p>
<p>Recalling my past, although it was very ordinary, I also had a lot of passion for struggle. In the future, I will strengthen this passion for struggle and courage to strive for my bright future!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Inept Compliments Lead to Rejection, Inability to Return Follows Guests' Exaggerations</p>
<p>However, his distress over Zhiqian's words was understandable. This was over. Gao Yingchang's attitude made it clear that he would not agree. He thought in his heart, "This is over," and at the same time, his hands couldn't help but make the "it's over" gesture, patting his buttocks heavily. His feet also jumped slightly. Little did he know that this jump made him a bit top-heavy. It just so happened that the ground he was standing on had a thin layer of green moss. So he slipped and slid, making a skating motion, and sat down. His buttocks made a loud thud, and he sat on the ground. Although he didn't feel pain, all the joints in his body were numb from the shock. He sat on the ground for several minutes, unable to speak. It was the teahouse attendant in the small house next door who was awakened by the sound. He came out and asked what the noise was. Jie Fu didn't want to answer, so he quietly helped himself up by holding onto the wall, walked under the eaves, leaned on the wall with one hand, and said to the teahouse attendant, "I went to look outside the window to see if my friend was inside. I didn't expect the ground to be so slippery and I fell." As he said this, he walked into the house. Mrs. Hu said, "Oh! Mr. Zhang, how did you get so much mud on yourself?" Jie Fu lifted the back of his long robe and saw that it was covered in mud. He blushed and said, "Isn't it all because of your business?" He wanted to continue talking and tell her what had happened, but the teahouse attendant who delivered the message had already returned with a reply. He said to Jie Fu, "Mr. Cheng has returned to his room and asked this madam to take his daughter to him. Mr. Cheng said, 'Director Gao is not at this table.'" Only then did Jie Fu realize that he had gotten muddy for nothing. The man in the suit was not Director Gao. He said "Oh," but didn't say anything else. However, the mother and daughter who were waiting for the information were feeling restless. Now that they had seen Mr. Cheng's message, what were they waiting for? Mrs. Hu was the first to stand up by supporting herself on the table. And Yueying was even more anxious than her, already walking to the door. (137)</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>On Food Taboos</h3>
<p>— Yisheng</p>
<p>In everything, we Chinese can't keep up with other countries, but in the matter of "eating," without exaggeration, we can say that our country is the strongest. The variety of foods and the sophistication of methods are unmatched. The Chinese have good appetites, second to none. Chinese restaurants are found all over the world and are very popular. This is due to genuine quality, not just luck. Even our eternal teacher, Confucius, set down many restrictive rules for eating—of course, this is a sign of deep study—such as "Do not eat food that is discolored, do not eat food that is malodorous, do not eat food that is improperly cut," and so on. Chinese customs have always had many taboos (this is also a strength compared to other countries, which should be added as a supplement), so it is not unique in the matter of eating, a great human desire. Moreover, influenced by the teachings of Confucius, the taboos have become uncontrollable! It should be known that taboos are mostly restrictions, combined with a small part of superstition.</p>
<p>Let me talk about some food taboos, based on what I know and can think of at the moment. Given the size of China and the many taboos, and the different customs in different regions, it is difficult to say everything in one word!</p>
<p>Tapping chopsticks and bowls is the biggest taboo. Not just children, but even adults, at the table, may inadvertently make this kind of movement, perhaps when they are feeling bored. But this taboo will be immediately thought of and corrected. There are two common sayings: "Tapping the bowl scolds the heavens, tapping the chopsticks scolds the earth."</p>
<p>"A gentleman does not eat overturned fish." I don't know where this rule comes from, but it is one that everyone wants to follow. In fact, if a whole fish is placed in a pot or bowl, you must start eating from the top and eat down to the bottom half, which is very difficult to eat. I think there must be some distortion in this saying, and it is probably more meaningful to say "A gentleman does not eat returned fish." Picking up a piece of fish with the chopsticks, looking closely at it, finding that it's not good, and changing to another piece, thus performing the procedure of returning the fish: this way of eating is too selfish, and the eating posture is not pleasing to the eye, so it should be on the list of taboos.</p>
<p>In some places, the fish head, or the duck head, is placed towards a clerk at a banquet in a shop. This is the owner's way of showing dissatisfaction with the clerk, giving a secret warning, or even hinting at dismissal. So normally, when there is nothing to express, if there is a bowl of fish or duck on the table, the fish head or duck head is always placed facing the seat of honor. This is a figurative method to avoid direct conflict between guests and hosts, and to save face for the employee. The intention is good. However, this method has become a habit and makes all the employees in the shop very wary of the head in the dish at banquets, regarding it as a great taboo.</p>
<p>There is much more that can be said. I will talk about it again when it is convenient. I will pause here for now.</p>
<h3>The Drifting Fragrance of the Royal Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Speaking of stages, the one in the Beijing palace was quite ordinary. The most special one was the one in the Summer Palace! It had three levels, and it is said that when it was first built, the floorboards were all movable and could be moved up and down, making it almost as flexible as modern elevators. When a play was being performed on the top level, the lower two levels, which were invisible to the audience, were already secretly preparing. When the play on the top level finished, it was immediately hoisted up and hidden, and the second level was hoisted up at the same time. All the sets had already been set up, and even the actors who were to appear first were already standing on the stage. This hoisting of the stage up and down saved the effort of setting the stage, and the two plays could be performed one after the other. At that time, such a clever structure was truly a novel and unprecedented show, which shocked many people. The first among the designers who presided over this project was the Empress Dowager herself. Unfortunately, it was later discontinued due to safety reasons, but the spacious scale and exquisite structure were still outstanding, far surpassing the stages elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now that we have come to Fengtian, everything is very old and it is naturally impossible to have such a beautiful stage! But in order not to make the Empress Dowager feel too uncomfortable, temporary preparations and decorations are unavoidable. Fortunately, we have eunuchs, and because there are many of them and they are capable, entrusting them with these scattered and mixed tasks is something they can really accomplish. Sure enough, before long, someone came to report: "Everything is ready, the actors are dressed, and they are just waiting for the Empress Dowager's decree to start the drums." At this time, I had to tell the Empress Dowager what plays I had chosen. I had only sent someone to inform the acting eunuchs and had not yet told the Empress Dowager. (248)</p>

<h3>Two Publications of the International Educational Film Association</h3>
<p>The Rome International Educational Film Association is an affiliated organization of the International Federation and the International Committee for Cultural Cooperation. It engages in international cooperation in the film industry. Its branch in China is the Chinese Educational Film Association. Information on its two major publications is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) "International Film Intercime Monthly" The International Educational Film Association has published this international educational film monthly for five years. It is available in Italian, English, French, German, and Spanish. Since January of this year, the content has been refreshed and the name has been changed to fully reflect the international nature of film issues. This is a publication of an important international organization. The issues discussed, the theoretical debates, and the prevailing opinions are all published after careful review.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, the International Association has completed a preparatory work, which is to study the scope of educational films, to make the issues related to them as clear as possible and to promote them. In the ethical and aesthetic aspects, systematic dissemination is used to gain general public support for the promotion of educational films.</p>
<p>Now, the International Association has entered a more practical second step, which is to discuss the educational issues arising from daily films and to use an educational stance to criticize which are the best films. Therefore, the monthly magazine devotes a considerable space to analyzing and pursuing the ideal aspects of moving film art.</p>
<p>The Paris International Association for Intellectual Cooperation and the Rome International Educational Film Association have cooperated for several years to ensure the success of films in education, culture, and knowledge. In the future, they will conduct further discussions on various issues, and opposing opinions will also be fully expressed.</p>
<p>The monthly magazine is a publication for promoting the business of the International Association, prompting the cultural community to pay attention to film education and life. It has invited authorities in the writing community to write articles. These writers deeply understand the unlimited power of film and the possibility of countless dangers. Therefore, the content of the journal is extremely exciting to educate through film.</p>
<p>(2) "Film Encyclopedia" After three years of hard work and long-term work, the International Educational Film Association has completed the editing of a dictionary of film art and industry. The Italian text will be published by Ulrico Hoebli Publishing House, a well-known international publisher. Preparations will be made for other languages.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented initiative, and there have been many difficulties. There are no precedents to follow, and even internationally accepted terms are sometimes lacking. Each major film producing country has its own idioms. In addition, because the scope of film is so wide, the industrial technology used on the screen includes chemistry, electrical engineering, sound recording, electroacoustics, and mechanics, so each part must be studied. Not only that, but art history, manufacturing, aesthetics, industry and commerce, stage technology architecture, etc., must also be studied.</p>
<p>The content of the book includes 600 specialized essays, 3,000 secondary articles, and 5,000 reference materials. No less than 400 authorities in science and technology, industry, and art have participated in the work, such as writing articles and editing. The encyclopedia consists of approximately four volumes, each with 1,000 pages, and approximately 5,000 charts and photographs. This is the result of painstaking effort and long-term work. All aspects and possibilities of film are discussed without omission. It is scheduled to be printed in the spring and published in the summer of this year.</p>
<p>The encyclopedia is a very large effort by the International Educational Film Association in the field of film publication. Future reprints will add new materials to make it an extremely important basic reference book for the film industry. The new inventions related to electrical photography and wireless broadcasting are developed by film, so they are also studied from a theoretical and practical perspective.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association Will Start Screening Educational Films this Semester</h3>
<p>Tuition Collection from Various Schools is in Good Condition</p>
<p>The Next Round Will Screen German Educational Films</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association has achieved very good results since it started screening educational films in schools at all levels in the city. It has been well received by students in various schools. This semester, the screening tour started on the 15th of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Schools Continue to Collect Fees</p>
<p>The tuition collection from schools at all levels this semester is very good. Most schools still follow the same method as last semester, with primary school students paying 20 cents per person, middle school students paying 50 cents, and university students paying one dollar. Students who paid last semester and are still studying at the same school this semester do not have to pay again. A small number of schools have requested to pay according to the method of collecting transportation fees, and the association has approved it.</p>
<p>A Large Batch of German Films Ordered</p>
<p>The films screened by the association are provided by the National Educational Film Promotion Office. Currently, one projector is dispatched to screen films at five schools per day. The film programs include "The Hawaiian Islands," "Iron Seed to Iron Block," and "Driving" (a comedy). The National Educational Film Promotion Office has ordered a large batch of educational films from Germany, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. German films will be screened starting from the second round.</p>
<h3>National Military Education Conference</h3>
<p>Held Today at the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Presidents of Major Middle Schools All Attend</p>
<p>The first centralized military training for first-year high school students in the city will commence on April 11th. The city's National Military Training Committee specifically requested the Education Bureau to convene a citywide national military conference to discuss all related matters. The Education Bureau has submitted this request to the Municipal Government, which has scheduled the conference for today at the Municipal Government. In addition to the presidents of high schools and higher institutions in the city, representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, various bureaus of the Municipal Government, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Security Office, and the Security Committee will also attend and participate in the discussions. Furthermore, representatives from various public organizations such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and the Municipal Education Association have been invited to attend as observers.</p>
<h3>Director of Education Bureau Pan to Visit the Philippines to Study Cultural Affairs</h3>
<p>Departs Shanghai This Morning, Returns Next Month on the Third</p>
<p>Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Tang Guanyu, will depart with a tourist group for the Philippines. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning aboard the President Wilson liner. It is reported that Mr. Pan will take this opportunity to study cultural affairs in the Philippines and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on March 3rd.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province's Plan for Staff Rotation Leave in Social Education Institutions Approved</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Social Education Institutions (such as People's Education Centers) staff rotation leave plan has been revised by the Provincial Department of Education and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. It is reported that henceforth, staff members of Jiangsu's social education institutions will also be entitled to winter and summer vacations. However, during these vacations (four weeks for summer vacation and two weeks for winter vacation), two-thirds of the staff must be on duty while one-third is on leave, with rotations upon completion of the leave period. (It is understood that social education institutions such as People's Education Centers and libraries still receive visitors even during school winter and summer vacations, and the presence of two-thirds of the staff will not hinder the operation of social education.) This will ensure that all staff members can take vacation according to regulations, and the institutions can remain open as usual for visitors.</p>
<h3>Pacific Relations Association Guangzhou Branch Established Last Night</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou, 19th Dispatch) The Guangzhou branch of the Pacific Relations Association was established last night at the YMCA. More than thirty Chinese and foreign dignitaries attended. Mr. Zhong, President of Lingnan University, chaired the meeting, and Dr. Wu Liande delivered a speech outlining the purpose of the Association.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Sets Deadline for Collecting Public Training Certificates</h3>
<p>Yu Zhongbiao Discusses the Final Batch, to be Released Soon</p>
<p>Registration for the current term of training directors has already ended. The Municipal Party Headquarters continues to receive applications for registration. Yu Zhongbiao of the Review Committee made the following announcement:</p>
<p>The Final Batch to be Issued Soon</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the review of applications for training directors and civic instructors closed at the end of July last year. The Review Committee, composed of nine members including Pan Gongzhan, Tong Xingbai, Jiang Huaixu, and Yu Zhongbiao, reviewed and approved applications, which were then submitted to the Central Government for review. Subsequent batches have been issued, and the final batch will soon be reviewed and issued by the Central Government. Therefore, the total number of qualified candidates for the current citywide review is difficult to determine precisely until the final batch from the Central Government is received.</p>
<p>Failure to Collect by Deadline Will Result in Reporting for Cancellation</p>
<p>The Review Committee is a permanent body and will not be disbanded upon completion of the review. The date for the next review will be determined by the Central Government. Furthermore, qualification in this review is not limited to party members; non-party members who have studied the Three Principles of the People may also apply for review. Training directors and civic instructors who have qualified but have not yet collected their certificates are required to bring four two-and-a-half-inch portrait photos, one yuan for the certificate fee, and three jiao for the stamp tax, along with a completed form, to collect their certificates within this month. Failure to do so will result in a report to the Central Government for cancellation of their qualifications next month.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Normal School Graduation Examination Advanced, to be Held in Three Zones</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Early April</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Province's Normal School graduation examination for the 23rd year will soon be held. The Department of Education, to facilitate student visits and internships, has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to advance the examination to early April. Furthermore, given that schools are dispersed across various counties and cities, and the students' years of study and subjects taken vary depending on the nature of the school, special regulations have been established to divide the examination into zones and groups to facilitate the process. The zonal division divides the province into three zones: Hangzhou, Taizhou, and Jinhua, with a zonal examination office established in each zone to oversee the examination affairs. The grouping method categorizes the schools participating in the examination into six groups: Normal, Kindergarten Normal, Four-Year Rural Normal, Nursery Normal, People's Education Experimental School, Three-Year Rural Normal, and Normal School Training Course. Examination questions will be set separately based on the teaching subjects and content of each group, in order to ensure suitability.</p>
<h3>National Central University's College of Education Experiments with Gifted Education</h3>
<p>Starting with an Investigation of Gifted Children</p>
<p>The experiment of gifted education has been strongly advocated by European and American education scholars, benefiting their nations greatly. However, Chinese scholars have rarely promoted it. During the National Education Conference in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), Professor Gao Junshan of National Central University proposed selecting gifted children nationwide to provide them with compulsory education at all levels. This proposal was based on the understanding that, at a time when educational funding is scarce, universal compulsory education is difficult to implement immediately, but it is possible to select and educate outstanding individuals nationwide. Geniuses are the leaders of society and the elite of a country. If gifted children nationwide can be selected and provided with compulsory junior high, senior high, and college education, it would be an immeasurable contribution to the country. Otherwise, the lack of opportunities for development for these rare talents would be a great loss to society. Moreover, geniuses account for a very small percentage of the national population, and the investigation is limited to children within schools, so the number is even smaller. The cost of this education would be minimal and easily planned for. In light of this, the College of Education of National Central University has resolutely undertaken this experiment. It is reported that the initial step is to investigate gifted children in various regions, starting with educationally developed areas. Professor Gao Junshan will be responsible for guiding the project, conducting various tests in each elementary school, and teachers will nominate four or five of the most intelligent children in each grade to participate in these tests. It is planned that this testing work will be completed within one semester, and once a sufficient number of individuals have been identified, they will be given special education.</p>

<h3>Han Juemin, Principal of Pudong Middle School, Sworn in Yesterday</h3>
<p>School Trustee Wu Xingya Delivers Remarks</p>
<p>Pudong Middle School held its opening ceremony yesterday, along with the swearing-in ceremony of the new principal, Han Juemin. Attendees included School Trustee and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Xingya, Zhang Jixin, Municipal Party Headquarters representatives Tao Baichuan and Wang Longzhang, guests Ren Xianqun, Meng Shouchun, Huang Xianzhang, Wang Hanzhang, Tang Jinbai, and over four hundred teachers and students. After the ceremonial proceedings, Chairman Wu Xingya delivered a speech, introducing the new principal and conveying the trustees' instructions, stating briefly: (1) Middle school students are at an important stage of education; the country is currently in crisis, and adversity builds the nation; students should not forget the saying that every citizen has a responsibility. (2) The New Life Movement's principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame should be used as the foundation for self-cultivation, respecting teachers, observing discipline, and cultivating new Chinese villagers, so that national rejuvenation will not be merely a slogan. (3) Students are the lifeblood of the country, and love is deep, therefore responsibility is crucial; those with bad habits will be strictly disciplined. The words were inspiring and moving. Speeches were then given by Tao Baichuan and Meng Shouchun, followed by Principal Han's acceptance speech, after which the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>News from the Evening School of the Lixin Accounting School</h3>
<p>The evening school of the Lixin Accounting School, located at 190 Ningbo Road in this city, was founded by accountant Dr. Pan Xulun, specializing in all subjects related to bookkeeping and accounting. Its purpose is to enable staff members of various organizations in the city to acquire the most practical knowledge in a very short period of time. The school has been established for seven and a half years, with each session enrolling 340 to 350 students. However, due to limited space, the school has been unable to increase the number of places, leaving latecomers often disappointed. Now, starting from this semester, the school has added new classrooms and expanded the number of places. In terms of subjects, the elementary level offers two classes, one in Chinese and one in English, in bookkeeping and elementary accounting. In addition to the advanced Chinese classes in advanced accounting, banking accounting, cost accounting, and auditing, an advanced English accounting class has also been added. Classes were originally held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, but now new classes have been opened from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM, allowing students who finish work early to attend classes earlier. The current session has already started, and enrollment is extremely enthusiastic. It is reported that each class will be full soon.</p>
<h3>"Life Quick Guide" Offers Discount to the Academic Community</h3>
<p>Since its publication, the 24th edition of "Life Quick Guide" has become popular throughout the country, enjoying unprecedented sales. This is due to its rich and practical content, divided into eight major categories such as Public Security, Historical Records, Hygiene, Transportation (divided into National and Shanghai sections), Shanghai Residence, Postal and Telecommunications, Literature and Art, and Special Features. The entire book is over 300 pages thick and is convenient for both home and travel use. Each copy is sold at the actual price of two jiao, and the purchase of one copy entitles the buyer to a free New Style Daily Life Ledger. The "Life Quick Guide" also includes a coupon for a large, colorful, finely printed map of Shanghai. It has now been learned that the Daily Life Company located at the west end of Avenue Foch (Nanjing West Road) is finding the price of the guidebook unsustainable. It plans to cease printing after the third edition is sold out. Considering the decreasing stock, a small portion has been reserved for purchase by the academic community. Those who purchase three copies together will have the postage waived. Those who purchase ten copies or more will have the postage waived and receive an additional 20% discount. For individual mail orders, each copy requires an additional three fen for postage and eleven fen for registration. It is available for sale at the Life Bookstore, the Dazhong Bookstore, this newspaper's service department, and all major newsstands.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Remedy for Lost Graduation Certificates</h3>
<p>Original School to Provide Proof, Submitted to Relevant Educational Administrative Agency for Approval</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has explained the remedy for students of various schools who have lost their graduation certificates, instructing the Jiangsu Education Department: "Received. When students of various schools lose their graduation certificates, the original school should provide proof and submit it to the relevant educational administrative agency for approval. If the relevant educational administrative agency verifies the facts, it only needs to provide proof to the agency requiring the proof using ordinary documents, without reissuing a graduation certificate or certificate of proof. For example, if a certain student is currently a civil servant and their previous graduation certificate has been lost, preventing them from submitting it to the Ministry of Personnel for review, the educational administrative agency can investigate the case and provide proof of the student's graduation qualification to the Ministry of Personnel. Please take note."</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan's Speech on Shanghai's School Education (II)</h3>
<p>Personally, I believe that for education today, not only in Shanghai but throughout China, in the next few years, perhaps three or five, or seven or eight, during this stage, both the central and local governments, from top to bottom, should devote their full energy to "elementary education." If this idea is considered correct, then from now on, we must make "elementary education" progress greatly and quickly. If financial resources are insufficient, we may as well slightly underestimate and slow down the expansion of "secondary education" and "higher education." However, this does not mean that "secondary education" and "higher education" should close down, but rather that we should concentrate all our efforts on enriching and universalizing "elementary education" first. In my personal opinion, I believe that we should make special efforts on "elementary education." Why do I have this idea? I think if you all calmly think about it, you may also feel that we should pay attention to "elementary education."</p>
<p>Let's compare China with other countries. Take England, we estimate its population to be 45 million, and it has more than 6 million elementary school students, accounting for more than 14% of the total population. Let's talk about France again, we estimate its population to be 40 million, and it has more than 4 million elementary school students, accounting for 10% of the total population. Germany, we estimate its population to be 60 million, and it has 9 million elementary school students, accounting for 15% of the total population. Japan, we estimate its population to be 55 million, and it also has 9 million elementary school students, accounting for 16% of the total population. The United States, we estimate its population to be 100 million, and it has 20 million elementary school students, accounting for 20% of the total population. In these countries, the smallest proportion of elementary school students receiving "elementary education" is 10% of the total population, and the largest is 20%. If we take a smaller scope, let's use Shanghai as an example to imitate the situation and proportion of various countries. Shanghai has a population of 3.4 million, and only 158,000 elementary school students, less than 5% of the total population. If compared with the country with the fewest elementary school students accounting for 10% of the total population, then our Shanghai elementary school students should also account for 10% of the city's population, and there should be 340,000 elementary school students. If compared with the country with elementary school students accounting for 20% of the total population, the United States, it would be more than double, and Shanghai should have 680,000 elementary school students. According to what I just reported, all the public and private elementary schools in Shanghai, in the 22nd year, although the number of students increased compared with the 21st year, it only increased to 158,164, that is, counting him as 160,000 people. If compared with France, where elementary school students account for 10% of the total population, Shanghai should have 340,000 elementary school students. Comparing the current number of 340,000, there is still a difference of 180,000 people. These 180,000 children, although they should be in elementary school, do not have the blessing and opportunity to go to elementary school. If compared with the United States, where elementary school students account for 20% of the total population, Shanghai should have 680,000 elementary school students, which is even more terrible. We are still 520,000 people short. These 520,000 elementary school students want to go to school but there are no schools to go to. Perhaps some people say that there are also private school students, and we have not counted them. Let's count these private school students as 40,000. Adding these 40,000 private school students to the elementary school students, it is only 200,000 people. Comparing the number of 200,000 elementary school students with the number of 340,000, there is still a difference of 140,000 people.</p>
<p>Also, I still want to report a supplementary material here, that is, the current school-age children in the city, what is called "school-age"? According to current laws and regulations, when a child is between six and twelve years old, it is called "school-age children." This is the age when they should enter elementary school. We spent a month in May this year doing a survey. In this survey, teachers and students from various schools unanimously went out to take on the survey work. Unfortunately, there is one shortcoming, that is, the concessions did not cooperate, so what we surveyed is only the area directly under the jurisdiction of the municipal government. There are a total of 110,000 school-age children. Among these 110,000 school-age children, a total of more than 55,000 have already attended school, almost accounting for about 50% of the number of school-age children, just half. There are still half of the school-age children who have not entered school. By analogy, at most half of the children in the city attend school, and half do not attend elementary school, which coincides with the number of 160,000 to 170,000. Since the need for elementary education is so urgent, it is naturally a somewhat comforting thing to be able to advance faster and increase the number of students by 15,000 in one year compared to secondary education and higher education. However, upon careful thought, it is only relatively somewhat comforting, but in reality, we should still feel ashamed. Why? Imagine, even if the population of Shanghai never increases, and the number of school-age children eventually remains the same, then, based on the ratio of increasing the number of elementary school students by 15,000 each year, it will still take 11 to 12 years to enroll the 160,000 to 170,000 out-of-school children, and it will also cost 3 to 4 million yuan more each year. Impatient people will definitely sigh with "waiting for the Yellow River to clear," so I say that even if it is somewhat comforting, it is not thorough.</p>
<p>"Elementary education" is "national education." Since it is so important, and the foundation of elementary education in our country is so fragile, how can our country compete with others? A country's competition with other countries completely depends on whether its citizens have knowledge and ability. If other countries' citizens have knowledge and ability, and our citizens do not have knowledge and ability, if other countries' citizens understand science, and our citizens do not, if other countries advance, and we lag behind, how can we compete with others? Competition completely depends on national strength, and its foundation completely lies in "education." If the education of this country, especially "elementary education," has not laid a good foundation, wouldn't it be a dream to build tall buildings? Our basic education is so empty, like building a house without laying a good foundation for the walls, how can it bear so much weight? Therefore, I say that if we want to compete with other countries, I will not talk about other competitions for the time being, first we must see whether our "national education" is on the horizontal line or below the horizontal line compared with general countries. In fact, our country's current "national education" is completely below the horizontal line. The "elementary education" in Shanghai is completely below the horizontal line. The "elementary education" in Shanghai cannot be compared with other countries. If we talk about the whole of China, it will be even more painful. Our country is said to have a population of 470 million, or at least 400 million. How many elementary school students are there in this population? According to national education statistics, it is said that there are 11 million elementary school students. We hear this number of 11 million elementary school students, and it seems like a lot. However, everyone knows that countries like England, France, Germany, and Japan only have tens of millions of people, so it is already very good for them to have millions to ten million elementary school students. If our country also has tens of millions to 100 million people, then having 10 million elementary school students can be considered acceptable. However, the number of our elementary school students is 11 million out of a population of 470 million, which, according to the percentage, only accounts for 2.4% of the total population. Compared with other countries, it does not even reach the odd number of others. May I ask, in this situation, how can we talk about resisting foreign aggression, how can we participate in actual warfare? Participating in actual warfare is not a trivial matter. First, we must assess our own strength. We don't even need to talk about the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the decline of industry and commerce, and the lack of strength to fight wars. Just this point of basic education alone makes us ashamed to have no place to stand.</p>

<p>The association has previously held one A and one B group race. However, members felt the distance was too short. The distance has now been extended to two weeks, totaling 11,476 meters. All schools, organizations, and individuals in the city interested in long-distance running are welcome to participate. (1) Date: March 3rd, 6:00 AM (Sunday). (2) Location: Sanlu Yuanlu Road, Nanshi, Shanghai. The starting and ending points are both located at the Chen Yingshi Pagoda in Laoximen. (3) Distance: 11,476 meters. (4) Prizes: Silver shields for the top three finishers, medals for the fourth to twentieth finishers, certificates for the twenty-first to two hundredth finishers, and timing for the top five finishers. (5) Registration: From now until noon on March 2nd. (6) Registration address: 272 Daji Road, Nanshi.</p>
<p>The association believes that the public in this city is most interested in long-distance running, so it has specially set up two hundred prize slots to prevent those who fail from being discouraged. The association's prizes for the top twenty finishers will be awarded on the spot, and certificates will be distributed starting on March 6th. The association's members who participated in various sports in the past and have not yet received their certificates are requested to come to the association to collect them starting on March 6th to complete the procedures, as it will take time to fill them out.</p>
<p>This two-week long-distance race hosted by the association welcomes participation from both members and non-members to encourage interest. In order to expand its affairs, the association has decided to solicit new members for the 24th year, with an annual membership fee of one yuan, a semi-annual membership fee of six jiao, and a monthly membership fee of two jiao. Those who wish to participate can go to the association to obtain membership cards.</p>

<h3>Male Writers and Female Depictions</h3>
<p>— Gui Huafen</p>
<p>Recently, a reporter from the Yomiuri Shimbun asked three female representatives of the current Japanese literary world, Chujo Yuriko, Nogami Yaeko, and Hasegawa Shigure, a very interesting question: "Do male writers really depict true women?"</p>
<p>In their replies, Ms. Chujo believed that male writers, when depicting women, often do so in ways that are convenient, interesting, or allow for love or contempt. Conversely, women are rarely depicted in other ways. As a result, some people regard women's bodies as objects of appreciation, depicting them with a mix of beauty and ugliness, while others depict women expressing sadness. However, most male writers fail to artistically represent the everyday, real-life demands of modern women. For example, today's young women, burning with the fire of youth, are passionately pursuing young men. However, when it comes to solving life's problems, they would rather marry middle-aged men who are economically independent and can provide security. Many writers find this phenomenon inexplicable and are unable to express it. This is because writers have not grasped women in the torrent of today's complex social life. It is also due to the various specific social constraints on writers, which prevent them from grasping women so comprehensively. Therefore, when the reporter asked her what kind of writer can depict true women, she said that they must have a sharp triangular prism for observing society, capable of capturing the historical opportunities for development in the complex relationships of our lives, capable of depicting the relationship between men and women, such as the unique nature of women's problems, and capable of observing and criticizing emotions or actions of women that have traditionally been considered inconvenient or unpleasant for men from a perspective that sees through social development. Only writers with this ability can represent the various realistic archetypes of women.</p>
<p>Ms. Nogami first criticized male writers for depicting women as sexual objects and agreed with Ms. Chujo's ridicule of male writers' insufficient understanding of new women. She said that today's writers often cannot see the real thing, so what they write is often neither fish nor fowl. She believes that if social life becomes more extensive, and men can invade women's realms in politics and economics, and women can invade men's realms, then it will not be difficult for male writers to depict women, nor for female writers to depict the world of men.</p>
<p>Ms. Hasegawa, on the other hand, believed that even great writers find it difficult to express subtle female psychology. However, young writers are more confident in expressing young women of their own generation, while expressing older people often lacks consideration and thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>The works of Kikuchi Kan were often cited as examples and pointed out for their shortcomings regarding the depiction of women by male writers. Kikuchi Kan was initially a naturalist writer but has now completely degenerated into a low-taste popular literature writer. His novels are all the same, depicting very sensual triangular or quadrangular love affairs. After the May Fourth Movement, he had a considerable influence on our country's literary scene, and writers who completely imitated him are still alive today. Their works have even confused many young people in the ten years after the May Fourth Movement. Even now, there are still some ladies and wives who embrace their novels day and night. This kind of creative trend of depicting women has recently seemed less popular among young people in general. As a result, an even more backward creative trend has unconsciously replaced it. That is—using the form of chapter novels to express such (or somewhat modified) themes. Novels such as "Tixiao Yinyuan" have become the most popular works in recent years. Some say that these are low-taste reading materials for ordinary citizens, with the majority of readers being ordinary citizens. However, it does not seem to be entirely the case. According to what I know, many university students read such novels. I have several fellow villagers who were studying at a certain university in Beiping. When the Japanese artillery fire rang in the suburbs of Beiping (1932), they returned south, passing through Shanghai and staying at the Dadong Hotel, but each of their suitcases contained a copy of "Tixiao Yinyuan." When they arrived at Dadong, they spread them out again. They said, "When traveling by boat or car, it is better than Ren Dan." This shows that its influence is not limited to one corner of ordinary citizens. Such works do not truthfully depict social reality or women. However, it is quite regrettable that, just as Ms. Chujo and Ms. Nogami ridicule Japanese male writers for rarely depicting true women, our country's male writers also rarely depict true women. During the May Fourth era, Mr. Lu Xun had already depicted the archetype of the peasant, "Ah Q," but today's archetypal woman has not yet been carved out by any writer like Cao Xueqin carved out Lin Daiyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber."</p>
<p>When will our writers present such works to our readers, recreating today's archetypal new woman in the complex social life, in the everyday real-life demands of women, and in the motives for historical development? We are eagerly awaiting.</p>
<h3>Past Events</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>Lately, every evening, I love to look out from the small building, watching the birds returning to their nests and the sunset glow, as if only at this time can I feel a slight sense of happiness, and it seems that only at this time is it most suitable to relive piles of old dreams.</p>
<p>The sunset glow is inherently lovable, especially the sunset glow in early winter, which is even more beautiful and lovely. Since autumn left the human world with a charming smile, the human world has lost a kind of warmth, a blue sky, and red leaves on the branches. Autumn took away the warmth of the human world and also took away the enthusiasm in my heart. Now, winter has come again.</p>
<p>The past is like a painted curtain, on which there are no flowers, no azure sea, and no vast sky; all that exists are gray paths, withered yellow leaves, and the wilderness of winter; however, the past, the past, I always feel is worth paying attention to, even if it is pain or bloodstains, I like it all.</p>
<p>I remember that the year before last, it was also in the early winter season, and I was living in a city in southern China. What I often cannot forget to this day is the sound of the reed flute. The sound of the reed flute in the South is truly the most charming. The May sun, the eyes of women in Fuzhou, and the Mid-Autumn Festival moonlight cannot compare to it. To a traveler who has been wandering for many years, it is the greatest elegy and the greatest lyrical poem in the world. At that time, every time the night was deep and quiet, I always liked to lean on the railing and listen to the sound of the reed flute played by a group of singers. I would often be intoxicated by the rhythmic, melodious, and mournful sound of the flute until the group of singers left and the sound of the flute faded away, and then I would jump out of my intoxication...</p>
<p>If I were to say that there was a page in my life in the past few years that I felt happy about, then it should be said that it was this time.</p>
<p>I feel that I am the most unfortunate person in the world. Happiness, happiness is always like the moon's reflection in the water, which cannot be grasped, especially in the arena of love. I have suffered so many grievances and so much contempt! Only I myself understand this hidden pain. For the sake of love, my tears have run dry! Love is like a dream! Love is like light smoke! Blown away by the storm.</p>
<p>However, my friends always think I am happy. They only see my smile and do not know that I nourish myself with pain every day!...</p>
<p>This is also a page of the past.</p>
<p>Now, I have to cheer up again to deal with this life, to deal with this environment, and stop having those absurd dreams!</p>
<h3>The Students of the Qingli New Year</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Mountain Shop</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>—A Brief Account of a Journey—</p>
<p>"Hey there!" shouted the errand boy—this is a lie; the errand boy didn't shout. He probably understood that soliciting business was useless. As long as a cart stopped on the road in front of the door, people would have to stop for a snack or overnight stay here, because going further up meant enduring hardship. The name "Zi" cart wouldn't be able to move forward even a step. Turning back required traveling twenty li to find another inn. In short, unless one was traveling by plane, passing through here required a rest. Although the shopkeeper might not be a master of all eighteen martial arts, proficient in boxing and kicking, the business was done with such an assertive manner! The errand boy was a strong, middle-aged man. Whether he actually shouted "Hey there!" or not, I don't know, but he certainly helped the carters unload the carts in an unhurried manner. You couldn't find any slickness in this errand boy. To make a comparison, he was somewhat like a stone. Why did I say "Hey there!"? I think everyone understands, no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>The shop had to be located in the mountains to have a romantic flavor. Since when did our nation start to seem like it had run into a nail of misfortune from the beginning? On the surface, people lived a peaceful life, but in their hearts, they always wanted to be romantic. However, they were not sincerely willing, but rather forced to. In order not to be killed by accusations, it was more appropriate to watch others be romantic, so everyone welcomed "Water Margin" but also felt that Wagang Village was wrong. How many novels in China depict "black shops"! But it's a pity that even in these remote mountains, you couldn't see anyone robbing the road with broadswords and axes. Rifles are, after all, more powerful. Of course, I'm not saying that no murder events ever happened here. Although this place is as civilized as any other, it is still far from Mr. Wells' Utopia!</p>
<p>This is a mountain shop because it is located in the mountains.</p>
<p>A few years ago, reports said that people entered the mountains to seek the Dao. In recent years, fate has been even worse, even more hopeless. There are probably more people hoping for living Buddhas and immortal envoys to resist Japan. I've also been driven to want to be unconventional. Since I'm in a mountain shop, I'm afraid I don't have the good fortune to see immortals. But I'm not discouraged either. I'm still just wandering at the entrance of the Taihang Mountains, far from ascending the hall and entering the house. It's okay to discount my hopes and keep half in my stomach. That's good. Could that burly errand boy be a hero of the Greenwoods? The woman poking half her head out from behind the wooden door, with a face like a winter melon rind, certainly had a past, strangely like a "Mother Night Demon." As for the old fellow sitting on the stone bench at the door, wearing a felt hat and smoking a dry pipe, there's naturally no need to doubt that even heroes of the Greenwoods were raised by mothers and fathers. It's just that I can't figure out what role the skinny man in front of the stove should play. He was coughing.</p>
<p>Walking around and taking a look, I wanted to discover something unusual, but there was nothing. I only saw a pig and a few chickens. The rest were farm tools. Not only were there no broadswords or clubs, but I couldn't even see a rifle, only a dull axe, and the hero of the Greenwoods was chopping wood. The woman with the winter melon rind face also came out, holding a child, and sat on the stone bench by the side of the road to breastfeed. It turned out she had just ground flour, and not only was her face white, but she looked like she had climbed out of lime from head to toe.</p>
<p>Now, some people may feel quite disappointed, but wait a moment. There is still one thing here that is enough for everyone to let their imagination run wild about ancient times. About twenty steps from this mountain shop, there is a stone-built gate, which had a building built on top of it, but it's gone now. The gate doesn't have its stones inscribed in stone, and the shopkeeper doesn't understand its history, but it's definitely a pass, because crossing a few ridges over is a relatively fertile basin, and all the surrounding thoroughfares have these same gates built. Maybe people hid inside to avoid the ravages of war in the past, or maybe it was the stronghold of a hero like Dou Erdun (is that how it's written?).</p>
<p>The shop is built against the mountain, with about six or seven rooms, and also a courtyard, where you can "lie down and eat the mountain scenery." It was already dusk. In the distant empty valley, there was a dog barking. The shopkeeper urged me to sit in the hall. The so-called hall was three mud rooms, with the God of Wealth enshrined in the middle. The couplet still read, "Business prospers throughout the four seas; wealth flourishes to the three rivers." At one end, a mat was spread on the ground, which was considered a bed. The shopkeeper probably slept on it, and guests could also "borrow its light" temporarily when they were tired. The shopkeeper brought water for washing my face. Looking at it, there was a spoonful, maybe a little more, saying that it was brought from a few miles away.</p>
<p>The meal was served, it was noodles, without vegetables, without vinegar, without oil, only salt. I waited for a long time, why? It's really hard to say. Unfortunately, I didn't get to eat human meat buns!</p>
<p>While eating, I thought it would be better to hurry in that night, lest I miss the opportunity to see people "with a history," let's say they were immortals!</p>
<h3>Toward Evening (2)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>The furnishings in opium dens are mostly simple, with nothing really to make people envious. There are rows of wooden beds facing each other, each leaning against the wooden wall. A space of three to five feet wide is left in the middle as a walkway. Most of the beds are covered with mats. A large portion of the mats are broken and filthy. But people seem very willing to give these mats face, and no bed is empty. People are lying full on the mats. In some opium dens, there are even chairs placed in the middle of the aisle for people to sit and wait. Although these people are slightly higher class than the group on the street, having the opportunity to "enter the hall," from their clothing and appearance, they hold the same philosophy of life as the group outside the door. The so-called ultimate joy in the world, other than this mouthful of "smoke," everything else is casual. At the same time, there are also those who usually consider themselves somewhat of a woman, who should bow or be shy to all men; now, they are all lying on the bed, even with their legs resting on the feet of the man on the neighboring bed, they are still indifferent.</p>
<p>The warm breeze of early summer evenings secretly blew into these opium dens, and secretly sent out a gust of heavy fog from the opium dens. As a result, the people inside the dens felt more comfortable, and the group outside the dens also felt a slight sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>The small, dilapidated street was filled with the shadows of night and also filled with the heavy fog of smoke. The streetlights began to flash out dim yellow eyes from this shadow and heavy fog, weaving out a nightmare of life. — This pair made in heaven walked through this street of dreams again.</p>
<p>The sound of leather shoes "clop! clop! clop!" accompanied the sound of rubber shoes "gubu gubu gu." Giving this street of dreams a kind of suffocating oppression.</p>
<p>"Damn it! What kind of world is this?" the tall one said as if hating it. "I never saw this kind of situation when I was in Japan. I was in Japan!" Saying this, he seemed to instantly transform into a noble person, and showed that he definitely did not belong to this place, and added a sentence: "Chinese people are all useless things."</p>
<p>"Useless things!" The short one added, his rubber shoes stepped on a puddle. "I think so too. I've traveled all over half of China and seen this same thing everywhere! This same thing." After a pause, he sighed twice: "Alas! Alas! Yes. Prostitution, gambling, and eating are the four great virtues of Chinese people. But now we must add this one. Become five virtues. Five virtues, chickens have five virtues! Congratulations! Congratulations!"</p>
<p>"Hehehe" the tall one laughed! Clop clop clop! Following this was still the demonstration of the leather shoes expressing the nobility of life!</p>
<p>The sound of the leather shoes became louder, higher, and more urgent. The short one's chest also became more and more breathless and swollen. The white-collared shirt also opened wider and wider. Finally, the particularly obese left breast, which had developed abnormally, also poked its head out from the opening of the shirt, to see the depression of this world.</p>

<p>Bad News Triggers Selling Activity, Gold Price Drops Another $9.90</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was affected by the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of the government regarding the gold clause, reducing the gold content of the dollar. The process is not expected to be hindered. Chinese merchants strongly sold U.S. dollars, causing the exchange rate to harden. Although there was a rebound in the middle, the upward momentum was weak, resulting in a heavy drop. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw a decline in London and stability in the U.S. The forward silver market rose slightly, and exchange rates rose across the board. London spot gold fell by 1.5 pence. Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened lower by $16-17, but there were few buyers. Sellers seized the opportunity to become active, and prices immediately fell. This was largely due to reports that the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in favor of the government in the gold clause case, and that the Chinese Ministry of Finance had also approved commercial groups' requests for incentives for silver imports. Major players such as Da Fa, Yong Heng, Yu, and Wan Xing all sold, causing the price to fall to $11-12. Qian Chang, Xiang Fu, Yu Yong Li, and Da Fa Yong bought in at low prices up to around $4. The Central Bank's exchange rate announcement showed a flat British pound and a rising U.S. dollar. The customs gold unit fell by 0.2%, and the gold standard price was $947.20, having no impact. After opening, the price continued to fall briefly. Buyers took advantage of the low price to buy in, gradually pushing the price back up. It was anticipated that the HSBC exchange rate announcement would show a flat British pound and a rising U.S. dollar by 1.875, leading to considerable struggle. After entering the market, banks scrambled to cover their positions, tightening the domestic market. Buyers became actively involved, pushing the price up to above the $20 mark. However, the upward momentum remained weak, so banks took advantage of the high price to sell, making it difficult to maintain the gains, and the price fell again. Sassoon was willing to sell near-term shillings, causing a temporary dip. Soon after, banks continued to cover at low prices, gradually pushing the price up again. However, the upward momentum stopped at a high point, and people's confidence remained uncertain. Sellers came in to be active, but it was difficult to sustain the rise. Major players sold off together, and long positions collapsed across the board, leading to a heavy decline at noon. In the afternoon, market sentiment was weak, and many parties rushed to close their positions, breaking below the $10 mark. However, because banks were still covering, the price was able to rebound. Although there was supply at high prices, banks repeatedly covered at this time, and the price of Indian silver did not change. The struggle was particularly intense. Later, as bank appetite waned slightly, sellers continued to flood the market. Major players, including a Mr. He and a Mr. Wang, both sold, gradually pushing the price lower. Yuan Mao Yong tried to buy aggressively at low prices and resisted stubbornly, but ultimately market sentiment was scattered and the trend was unsustainable. Rumors spread, and major players rushed to cut their long positions. The exchange rate hardened further, creating a new low price of $905. The price of Indian silver did not move in the first two announcements, but rose slightly after the low due to double settlement prices, presenting a final picture of struggle. Yesterday's market situation was initially stable and then weakened. The upward momentum stopped at a high point, allowing sellers to seize the opportunity to become active.

<p>Chinese Merchants Sell Off U.S. Dollars, Easing Exchange Rate</p>

The morning opening exchange rate for the near date was 1 shilling and 6 pence for the British pound and $36.625 for the U.S. dollar, each tightening by 0.01875 compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's exchange rate announcement showed a flat British pound and a rising U.S. dollar by 0.01875, and the customs gold unit contracted by 0.2%. However, due to the weak sentiment of Chinese merchants, reports of unfavorable news, and a desire to sell, the market hardened immediately after opening. The gold market also fell. Banks also lacked buying appetite. The HSBC exchange rate announcement showed a flat British pound and a rising U.S. dollar by 0.01875, all due to the gold clause ruling in favor of the government and the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, causing the exchange rate to rise. After entering the market, the gold market gradually stabilized, and banks scrambled to cover their positions, tightening the market step by step. Banks took advantage of the high price to sell, but the sentiment of Chinese merchants remained weak, and buying appetite was not strong. After entering the market, the situation reversed and became loose. Sassoon was willing to sell spot shillings. Banks maintained the price by buying at low prices, but it was difficult to sustain. The underlying trend remained hard at noon. In the afternoon, the sentiment of Chinese merchants continued to be timid and they continued to sell off, hardening the market. However, because banks covered at low prices and the price of Indian silver did not move, there was still hovering. Rumors such as the U.S. dollar reducing its gold content and the establishment of loans, etc. were rampant. Chinese merchants still sold off, and the market also tended to loosen. The price of Indian silver did not change in the second telegram announcement, and the market slightly stabilized. The closing selling price for the near date was 1 shilling and 6.025 pence for the British pound and $37.1875 for the U.S. dollar. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound loosened by 0.000625 and the U.S. dollar hardened by 0.00375. Chinese merchants sold off approximately 500,000 U.S. dollars and a small number of shillings. Sassoon sold spot shillings. The Central Bank aggressively covered forward contracts. American Eastern Bank slightly bought U.S. dollars. The banks' buying appetite remained strong. A record of yesterday's transactions is below.</p>

<p>The Money Market Situation is Even Tighter, Small Trade Associations Actually Liquidate Each Other</p>
<p>The recent money market situation appears superficially calm, but interbank lending, except for Lian Zhi, has no market. Even if there is a shortage of small amounts, such as 5,000 or 10,000, in small trade associations, they must be introduced. This has made interbank lending even rarer than before. Each bank operates on its own strength. Early morning transfers were only over 1.5 million, new transactions were over 300,000. Small trade associations have no market, and must rely on the checks of the money market reserve for introductions, as if exchanging cash for cash. The interbank lending rate is still open at 9%, and since no one dares to draw out, the rate is not clearly visible, but is secretly around 1.45%. Banks' settlements included over 2 million for foreign banks' check settlements, over 5 million for various goods exchange deposits and miscellaneous settlements, over 800,000 for special exchange settlements, over 1.4 million for foreign exchange settlements, and 500,000 for warehouse deposits. Chinese banks' settlements included over 2.6 million for check settlements, over 5.5 million for various goods exchange deposits and tax miscellaneous settlements, over 700,000 for special exchange settlements, over 800,000 for foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 for warehouse deposits. Japanese banks' settlements included over 1.7 million for check settlements, over 4.4 million for various goods exchange deposits and miscellaneous settlements, over 400,000 for special exchange settlements, over 800,000 for foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 for warehouse deposits. Money shops' foreign public bills settlements exceeded 16 million, foreign exchange transfers settlements exceeded 3.6 million, various route exchange settlements exceeded 500,000, customer route sources were 150,000, with no news of outflow, banknotes recalled exceeded 600,000, circulating notes issued were 900,000, unmarked notes were 400,000, foreign mortgages redeemed exceeded 600,000, and cash settlements were 500,000. In terms of subsidiary currencies, corner coins fell back and copper coins rose. Jiangnan small silver coins fell back 3 yuan to 836 yuan, with 5,000 corner transactions. Guangdong small two yuan fell back 2 yuan to 741 yuan, with 175,000 corner transactions. Copper coins rose by 1,500 cash to 328,500 cash, with 50,917,500 cash transactions, equivalent to 15,500 yuan in foreign currency. Also, the total number of exchanges at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 19th was 6,961,472.45 silver dollars, including 4,292,126.711 silver dollars and 2,669,345.74 silver dollars in remittances.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Human Power Cannot Support It, the 23rd Customs Falls $2-3 at Once</p>
<p>The 96th Issue Also Follows Suit, Falling $0.60-0.70</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw prices mostly trending downward. A sudden reversal occurred in the 23rd Customs issue, and cracks appeared in the long positions. The so-called government recovery theory was completely based on rumors. Manipulators were also inevitably outmaneuvered and unable to pull up the price. The general trend was gone, and manipulators could also reflect. The 96th Issue was particularly crowded with long positions held by major players. Over-the-counter swaps for long positions were mostly rejected by the counterparty. Credit was unusually tight, and there was no delivery of goods. Most were prepared to default, and a few were still swapping. The number of accounts existing in February still exceeded 8 million, and the future was still dangerous. The market situation was that credit remained unusually tight. It was heard that rice imports required approximately 50-60 million, and six-month long-term loans from money shops were very large, approximately 80-90 million, mostly due in March and April. In this situation, the money market would inevitably sell off assets to seek profits. The 96th Issue, being a valueless asset, was naturally the first to be impacted. Arbitrage transactions did not occur, and the future of market prices was difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday, bond markets mostly fluctuated downward, with most transactions being swaps. The 23rd Customs issue saw the No. 21 seat bravely selling off first, gradually unloading across the board, becoming more vigorous as it sold. The total sales for the day amounted to approximately 2-3 million, making it impossible for market prices to be maintained, and things worsened with each passing moment. Sellers of the 96th Issue were unusually enthusiastic. Seat No. 41 was released across the board, and long positions in the No. 20 seat also sold off one after another. Other long positions also engaged in swaps like a storm, and its impact was not easy to calm for a while. As a result, market prices generally fell slightly by $0.05, $0.10, or $0.30, the 96th issue fell slightly by $0.60-0.70, and the 23rd Customs issue fell sharply by $2-3, with shockwaves arising one after another. There were still storms ahead. The total number of transactions amounted to 13,880,000. The resulting increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Rallies After Gold Clause Case Ruling</p>
<p>According to a report from the Xin Feng Foreign Company, the New York stock market yesterday (18th) saw a sharp rally and extremely active trading. The strong market sentiment was rare in recent times, reminiscent of the prosperous era before 1929. Once the gold coin clause case was ruled, orders from all over the country surged in like a torrent, reaching an estimated 5 million shares for the day. Initially, speculators anticipated that the government would not win completely, so exchange staff stood in the market, prepared to immediately announce a market shutdown if the market collapsed. However, the ruling was beyond these people's expectations, and the market was completely unprepared. Railroad stocks saw the strongest gains, with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway once surging by $10.50. Railroad companies had issued a particularly large number of gold bonds, so railroad bonds advanced by around $5. The announcement of the ruling also triggered short covering of gold and silver stocks, with each soaring by approximately $7. After the market soared, it returned to silence and experienced a correction, but returned to high levels before the close. The bond market also jumped wildly after the announcement, with gains and losses amounting to approximately 7 million between noon and 1 p.m., before also returning to a calm state. Treasury bonds without the gold coin clause broke the previous record high. In summary, they rose by $5-10 in 30 seconds. Public gold coin clause bonds paled in comparison and fell slightly in price. Railroad bonds were in the limelight, and corporate bonds also rose sharply by around $5 at one point. Although stocks on the small exchange were subject to profit-taking by long positions at high levels, they were able to maintain their levels and did not fall. Some also rose by as much as $5. After the announcement, the price of Montgomery Ward silver rose by half a point. The total volume of transactions was 1.91 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower</h3>
<p>Fluctuations of Yarn Prices</p>
<p>The yarn market saw advances in the morning and declines in the afternoon, showing a fluctuating pattern. The significant volume of settlements by a certain company in the past two days did not affect the market, entirely offset by profits realized by retail investors. Regarding this month's yarn, the market suggests that major players were buying at the price ceiling of 176 yuan, inclusive of taxes. Now, with the rebound of American cotton, confidence is stable, so the market appears calm. However, most people are observing with caution.</p>
<p>Gold Rooster Rises in Morning, Retreats in Afternoon</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for yarn futures showed firmness across all months due to bullish news about American cotton and a sense of tension in the market. However, the bullish positions of two major companies, after being completely settled in the past two days, still had buyers, all well-prepared and temporarily inactive. Consequently, short positions were covered, pushing the market upwards, resulting in gains of 4, 5, 6, and 9 jiao across various months. In the afternoon opening, there were reports of sluggish spot yarn trading, with quiet transactions. Dafu, on behalf of a certain company, switched from long to short positions, causing a sudden drop in the market, with declines of 4, 5, 6, and 7 jiao across various months. Sales included Dafu 2,850 bales, Jun Chang 400 bales, Changfeng 3,450 bales, and Tongxing 300 bales. Purchases included Dafeng 2,100 bales, Meiji 600 bales, Suilong 450 bales, Yi Chang 1,000 bales, Shengyuan 550 bales, Yuanda 400 bales, Yuanda 550 bales, Taichang 400 bales, and Jinchang 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Exceed 500 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were brisker than before. Statistics show that various trading groups bought a total of 545 bales throughout the day. Market conditions were calm. The purchase volume of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Luzhou 40, Nanjing 5, Mainland 255</p>
<p>Guangdong 25, Fellow Traders 15, Ningbo 3</p>
<p>Sichuan 75, Changsha 40, Henan 10</p>
<p>Yunnan 60</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell. However, American cotton rose 17 points due to the gold bar case verdict, while Indian cotton fell 2 rupees. Gold prices rose and then fell, so sentiment was flat. According to cotton industry insiders, Shanghai has ample inventory and tight credit, so they remain bearish on the cotton market. However, Yuanda's short positions have been completely cleared.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Shows Little Fluctuation</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for cotton futures was robust, mainly because of the rebound of American cotton and the surge in the U.S. grain market after the gold bar case verdict. Most people were bullish on the prospects of foreign cotton. The number of chips in the market was relatively scarce, and the market atmosphere was particularly tight. Retail investors flocked to cover short positions, so the market opened stronger. Another rumor was that Weitong Factory had 2,000 dan of inventory this month. All months rose by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao. In the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere suddenly changed, and the situation weakened, as the gold market rose and then fell. Shanghai has very thick spot cotton inventories. Large quantities of cotton from Jinan, Zhengzhou, Hankou and other places in Shandong have not yet been shipped, so there is no reason to be optimistic about the future. Therefore, all months fell by 1 jiao, 1.5 jiao to 2 jiao again. However, the market was not as panicked as the previous day. Sales included Tongji 1,400 dan, Dafu 2,800 dan, Taixing 1,000 dan, Xincheng 1,200 dan, Yikang 1,600 dan, Yifeng 1,400 dan, Changhe 4,100 dan, Junchang 1,300 dan, and Runkang 1,000 dan. Purchases included Tongfu 2,800 dan, Tongji 1,300 dan, Yuanda 4,100 dan, Gengfeng 1,200 dan, Xiecheng 1,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,100 dan, Dafeng 1,000 dan, Jinchang 1,300 dan, and Yuanda 4,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Needs Are Only Sporadic</p>
<p>The spot cotton sales market is still flat, but sporadic transactions continue. The source includes 100 bales of Yao cotton and 40 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>American Cotton Boosted by Gold Bar Case</p>
<p>Brokers Rushed to Buy: Up 16-17 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened lower because of long positions and nervous sellers. All months fell 2-4 points. After the gold bar case verdict, previous sellers quickly bought back. At the same time, Wall Street was strong, and brokers also rushed to buy. All the amounts transferred by buyers were absorbed, and prices rose sharply. The industry believes that this judgment can increase activity in the textile industry and spot goods. The close was firm, with spot prices up 15 points and futures up 16-19 points. The British cotton market was flat, with spot prices up 2 points and futures down 3-4 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by European exporters, and then fell back due to long profits. Pingguoer rose half a rupee, Aomula rose 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 1.625 rupees. Original telegraph left, (18th telegraph)</p>
<p>According to a report from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 19th was 251 rupees, higher than the previous day's close of 3.875 rupees.</p>
<p>Rangoon Cotton Exports</p>
<p>Mumbai, 18th: The amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 1,199 bales, of which 225 bales were to Liverpool, 375 bales were to Hamburg, 500 bales were to Bremen, and 99 bales were to Antwerp.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Flour Market Shows Near-Term Stability and Long-Term Flatness</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of first flat and then stable. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago rose about 5, 6, and 7 jiao, and Canada rose 1 jiao. After the opening price, the current month was slightly lower by half a cent because of the slightly higher volume of long positions. The distant months, because of the rise in foreign wheat prices, sentiment remained stable. After the second session, the current month was active in spot sales, and sentiment saw a return to stability, but the distant months saw more selling because a large factory continued to order a ship of Australian wheat for only 4.75 yuan per dan, so the market atmosphere also weakened. When opening in the afternoon, transactions in all months had turned light. The current month remained high due to tight spot goods, and the distant months were slightly lower due to the slight output from factories. Looking ahead, it is feared that the market will show near-term stability and long-term flatness. As a result, the current month was up by a small 2.5 li, March to May were up by a small half cent, June was up by a small 2.5 li, and July was unchanged.</p>
<p>American Wheat Cheap, Local Wheat Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, and the market for each month was generally calm. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago rose by 5, 6, and 7 jiao, and Canada rose 1 jiao. After the opening price, the market atmosphere in February and March hovered and was slightly weak, because although the price of foreign wheat rose, the spot price of foreign wheat was still sluggish. As in the previous day, a ship of Australian wheat was opened for only 4.75 yuan per dan. Yesterday, the price of American wheat was said to be only 3.5 yuan, so it was difficult to boost sentiment. As a result, February fell by 2 cents, and March fell by 2 cents. The spot wheat market saw very smooth transactions. Because of the credit crunch, cargo owners were eager to sell, and factory stomachs were also eager to buy because current flour sales were relatively strong. Gaoyou wheat opened at 3.83 yuan, Fengbu wheat at 3.93 yuan, and Haizhou wheat and Suzhou wheat both at 3.95 yuan, for a total of more than 8,000 bags, which were bought by Fuxin, Fufeng, and Shenda factories.</p>
<p>Wheat and miscellaneous grains will open higher tomorrow, but there is fear that there will not be a large rise. Wheat is expected to see a decrease in supply of 2,851,000 bushels, which is slightly less than expected.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Rise to Purchase Bran</p>
<p>The bran market has been trending upward recently, because the stocks of each factory are very dry, and the large factories have reduced the number of trucks, which has caused the demand to rise, which is unavoidable. It is said that Japanese merchants have been active and have been buying in batches in recent days. Mainland traders have also been buying in succession. Therefore, the asking price has risen, and each bran has been asking for 2.75 yuan. According to the speculation of those in the industry, if the current sales are still active, there is still a tendency to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Foreign Sesame Seeds Fall by Another 1 Jiao</p>
<p>Soybeans Temporarily Lack Rising Strength</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market situation, although it inherited the tight wind of the previous day, lacked the strength to rise, so the market price remained at the original level. Hankou beans were expected to rise, and the market trend was also stable. Yesterday, the whole city opened 10 cars of Yingzhou beans, priced at 3.75 to 3.8 jiao, more than 300 bags of Guide beans, priced at 3.85 jiao, and 1 car of Bangbu beans, priced at 3.7 jiao, all of which were bought by oil factories. Hankou Zha beans were traded in this street and by mainland traders for more than 1,500 bags, priced from 3.64 to 3.65 jiao. Sesame seeds were more actively sold on foreign farms, with more than 1,000 tons purchased by Jardine Matheson and Schappi, priced at 9.7 yuan, a drop of another 1 jiao from before. Spot goods were still flat. Yesterday, a Japanese trader bought 100 tons of Hunan clean yellow sesame seeds, priced at 7.76 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Market Shows Little Glory or Disgrace</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang was stopped for a day, and the arrival of boats suddenly surged slightly, with a total of more than 50 numbers (nearly 10,000 stones in total). However, the sales market was not refreshing. The price of each thick japonica rice was only slightly higher by 5 cents due to the good appetite of this street, and the rest, such as Changbang and Nangang, showed no glory or disgrace. Each late rice gang also packed only 200-300 bags for Qingdao, and the same color of flatness was seen. There were no Xuan Zhi for each color of Du Jian and Yin Bian Yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The source from various roads in Hexia in the past two days was 30-40 numbers. The market went weak for each cargo. The price of white japonica and thin rice was slightly lower by 1 jiao, the price of Keyuan and Zhong Ci Benyuan was tired for several points, and Du Jian was also tired by nearly a foot. There was no rise or fall in the price of other colors.</p>
<p>No. 3 Saigon Sells Well in Mainland</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was slightly less popular, but the owners' thoughts were still firm, and the selling price was shouted higher. In particular, No. 3 Saigon was welcomed by various roads in the mainland. Although many orders have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the spot stocks on the market have long been sold out, with fewer floating stocks, hoarding is strange. Yesterday, only more than 3,000 bags were opened in the whole city, and the price rose by more than 5 cents. Saigon No. 1 rice and broken rice opened more than 4,000 bags in total, with a quota of 200 tons, all of which were distributed to the mainland. The market was also firm. There were fewer stocks of Ke Xian, and the owners always hoped for good, but yesterday's turnover was less than 1,000 bags, and the price was also firm.</p>
<h3>Seafood</h3>
<p>Jellyfish Skin Arrives, Stocks Are Both Scarce, Prices Soar</p>
<p>Jellyfish skin stocks in Shanghai are all dry and scarce. As for the mountain merchants, such as Daishan, Sijiao, Huanglong, Qushan and other places, there has been a lack of incoming goods for a long time, only Yangshan has slightly arrived, but the number is very small, and it is sold as soon as it arrives, resulting in a situation of supply falling short of demand. Merchants from Sichuan, Hankou, Shantou, Guangdong and other places all have appetites and are waiting for goods to be added. Therefore, the goods accumulated by the merchants are all sold at higher prices. Yesterday, the market called for old skin at 18 yuan, new skin at 16 yuan, and jellyfish heads at 9.5 yuan, and many did not want to sell them. According to industry insiders, if the arrival of mountain merchants does not surge, there is still a tendency to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Black Iron Nails Opened in Very Large Numbers</p>
<p>Black iron nails have recently developed in transactions. Traders from the Yangtze River, Sichuan, Yantai, Qingdao, Tianjin and other places are very strong in their appetite. Therefore, the number opened in recent days is very large. The market situation is very firm because of weak stocks and not much arrival. The current market is estimated at 52 yuan per box (600 bags) for three points, 50 yuan for four points, 50.05 yuan for five points, and 48 yuan for six points. If there are 300 bags per box, it is estimated at 27 yuan, 25.5 yuan for four points and five points, and 24.5 yuan for six points. It is estimated that more than 300 boxes have been opened. It is said that only three or four companies on the market currently hold this kind of stock, so the level of estimation is unusually high. It is expected that the market situation will continue to improve in the future.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Market Remains Dull</p>
<p>Shanghai's external silk sales remain quiet. The dull market atmosphere does not seem to be easy to develop for a while. Although the overseas silk market has slightly increased (1.42 yuan in Citibank and 650 yuan in Japan), the exchange rate is still long, resulting in a difference of 30 yuan in the price inquiry. Manufacturers are also unwilling to compromise too much, so there are no transactions. Users are not actively buying, and only sporadic transactions are made yesterday. The silk market is currently only observing and hovering.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's newspaper reported that Ping Shui tea companies holding the financial hub, such as Yuanlong and Xielong, were said to be preparing to liquidate. Mr. Jianhu, the dispatch from Xielong Tea Company, issued a statement to the museum that this was not the case. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>I read in the business news column of your newspaper today (19th) that Yuanlong and Xielong of Ping Shui Tea Company are preparing to liquidate, and I was shocked to read it. I think that Xielong continues to operate without any changes. At this time when we are developing in all directions, there is suddenly this news. Of course, your interview is untrue. It concerns the reputation of our company, and I hope you will correct it immediately to avoid misunderstanding. Sincerely, Mr. Chief Writer of Shenbao, Xielong Tea Company, February 19th,</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Clock</h3>
<p>— Ge Bai</p>
<p>When I was a child in the countryside with shepherds, I didn't know what a clock was. I looked up at the sun and knew when to eat and sleep. On rainy days, I could also use my experience to regulate it; even if it was a little early or late, it didn't matter to the carefree country people.</p>
<p>After a few years of good harvests, my father admired the red slip of "Passing on a Family of Poetry and Ritual," so he sent me to school. At that time, in addition to telling me to read, I also learned the importance of time. For example, get up at seven o'clock, have breakfast half an hour later, and go to class at nine o'clock, etc. If I still looked up at the sun, this school would almost become a shelter. And depending on when the students arrived at school, the principal would definitely tell the students, school staff, and all kinds of people one or two hours in advance to sweep the courtyard and clean the classroom, and then he could win an award hanging in the mirror frame.</p>
<p>So I firmly remembered the importance of clocks from then on, thinking that when I became the principal in the future, I would also buy a round thing with such a long chain. Isn't it majestic for the principal to often take it out and look at the time?</p>
<p>Later, I came to Shanghai to study. The first thing I did was spend five silver dollars to buy that majestic clock. At the train station, I often took it out to tell my father how many minutes the train was going to arrive, but my lame thing ran too fast, which made me a little disappointed. -- The principal's value must not be small, right? I always kept it in mind.</p>
<p>Here I would like to mention that I studied very hard, got two years of A-level report cards, and applied to my father to buy a clock worth more than ten yuan, and I lived in peace from then on.</p>
<p>But when I entered middle school, this clock lost its effectiveness again. The six o'clock bell rang, but no classmate got up. Although my watch also pointed to six o'clock, I didn't dare to say it was accurate. The same was true in class. The teacher always stepped into the classroom five to fifty minutes longer than the scheduled time. Even later, when I learned to watch movies, my watch always ran too fast.</p>
<p>Once, my friend got married, and I suffered a lot from the clock. I went to attend the wedding on time, and the people in charge told me that the groom himself had not come. By the time I finished eating and returned to school, I was almost locked out of the school gate. I had no choice but to use the old method again. It was quite accurate to look up at the sun. We country people can be proud of this.</p>
<p>Finally, let me tell you a joke about clocks, which I read in a foreign newspaper:</p>
<p>There was a man named Tom whose clock was broken and he didn't repair it. His friend Jack questioned him. Tom said, "This way, there are two times a day that are the most accurate."</p>
<p>However, this method is still not common in China. What we need is a clock that doesn't even have two accurate times a day.</p>
<h3>Little Fisher Girl</h3>
<p>— Sanlang</p>
<p>The winter by the sea is still so warm. Although violent sea winds are constantly floating over everything on the earth, it seems like the breath of leisure flowing from the distant Indian Ocean, giving people the feeling that there is no terrible frost and cold. Sometimes the sky gushes out with sad clouds and hangs down strings of fine rain, which also shows the loneliness and desolation of the seaside.</p>
<p>There is always a vast and loose layer of yellow soil, on which grows such green and soft reed grass, fluttering without a moment's stop. Except for the distant rural scenery and the rugged mountainside looming in the hazy mist, there is nothing else to be found on the beach.</p>
<p>At that time, I was a worker on a farm. I brought a deep urban illness there to be treated by the natural wild scenery and fresh sea breeze. I was very happy, and I hoped to get beautiful results.</p>
<p>-- A young man who has fallen into the morbidity of the times.</p>
<p>Yes, every day I followed two good friends to do the work that could heal my sick body. Although people who were used to being comfortable in the city were also able to follow the farmers' labor operations.</p>
<p>What I can never forget on the beach are the simple and brave fishermen and the innocent and lively little fisher girls. Yes, the deathly calm seaside has no other shadows every day except for those fishermen. So, we quickly greeted them and her. As the days passed, we learned that they had moved from Guanghai a hundred years ago. Their village was about two miles away from us, and we could see it very clearly. They were old mud-brick houses, and there were no more than a hundred people in the village, and most of them had left. Only the old fishermen, women, and children were left.</p>
<p>Every day, we can see several teenage girls and children catching fish and shrimp along the coastline, and sometimes digging up small insects in the loose soil. They all wear bamboo hats and small hats, and their lively posture is always lovely. They are not as proud as the children in the city, and all they have is naughtiness without malice.</p>
<p>There is also a very interesting story about how we made friends with them. It was at dusk, when the western peaks were still hanging with such a light red glow, and the winter evening chill was gradually thickening. We returned from afar in a small boat, and when we arrived at their village, we could see the old little house silently from the dense reeds. At that time, there were four little girls of about thirteen years old jumping around lively, startling us. They quickly ran to the shore to see. Yes, they still had a shy smile on their faces.</p>
<p>-- Little girls! Have you had dinner yet?</p>
<p>-- What are you doing? The captivating smile came out.</p>
<p>-- If you haven't eaten yet, please come to our garden to eat. Okay?</p>
<p>-- I've already eaten it. The youngest one said innocently.</p>
<p>-- What's your name!</p>
<p>-- Goldfish. They were laughing again.</p>
<p>-- Come and play with us every day! There are beautiful stories to listen to there. Your dad won't scold you, they're already our good friends.</p>
<p>-- I know, but it's getting dark now.</p>
<p>It was a tactful laugh that sent us off, and our hearts were so happy!</p>
<p>After that, they became our best friends, and we often gathered together to talk and laugh. We got many interesting stories from their mouths, and undoubtedly, they were also fascinated by our urban stories.</p>
<h3>Night in a Inn</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>For no reason, it started snowing lightly again. The sky was yellow and boundless, like the endless sea of sand in the Gobi Desert. The weather in the north is used to opposing people, but it is not as satisfactory as in the south.</p>
<p>And there is another unfortunate thing: the sky is gradually darkening; the guests are shivering in the carriage shed, cold and afraid; the coachmen, they are really able to figure out the intentions of the guests a little bit, and they have long been planning in their hearts how to get a warm kang to sleep on for a night, and ask for a bowl of yellow wine to warm their stomachs, so they put on a solemn voice and said: "It looks like this bad snow will have to last for half a day and a night. If we walk for another half an hour, the sky will be as dark as San Zaitou. Driving in the snowy night, I'm not only afraid that the animals can't stand it, but also think about the grandfathers, it's probably not convenient to carry some goods with you, so why don't you find a shop to stay in."</p>
<p>In fact, what I am worried about is not the "goods" that total less than 20 yuan -- those headaches</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Powdered wound ointment and other medicines and pills and powder plasters, it's useless to take them away; and the three guests in the same car are all frozen with blue faces, chattering teeth, and their hands and feet are so stiff that it is difficult to move. That is the fact. As soon as they heard those words, they didn't even need to discuss them. Everyone nodded and agreed to tell the coachman to find a "honest" inn nearby and rest there for a night before talking about it.</p>
<p>The car rolled on the uneven road one step at a time. The unhappy sound of the wheels was accompanied by the faint gasping of the animals. The snowflakes hit the car shed. It felt cold when I heard it. When the wind blew up the car curtain, we saw that the sky outside was already completely dark.</p>
<p>After walking another two zhang, we were in a dilapidated small inn with a paper lantern with "Zhao Shang Inn" hanging in front of the door, like meeting relatives outside the Great Wall, and we were so happy to stay down.</p>
<p>Although it was quite clear that there was no good support in such a broken courtyard, it was better than shrinking up somehow, and the coachman was unwilling to walk any further. So after a break, we stayed in a relatively large west guest room.</p>
<p>After washing our hands and feet with hot water, wiping our faces with a face towel with the smell of mud, and the kang was also lit, the three guests huddled on the kang to warm themselves, while waiting for the hot rice and wine to be cooked. The waiter put on a yellow large insurance lamp, and there was a small light in the room.</p>
<p>In order to save some oil and fire, the shopkeeper put dinner in the hall outside. "Guests all eat in the hall, and they can make a few more friends. People who go out rely on friends, haha, haha..."</p>
<p>In this way, in the shopkeeper's entertainment, we went to the hall and mixed with the new and old guests.</p>
<p>Traveling doctors, Jianghu rogues, street performers, fur traders, and "friends" who rely on six dice to live...</p>
<p>After dinner, there was nothing to do. Occasionally a few people sat close, leaned on their bodies: "Where are you from...?"</p>
<p>"I dare not... I'm a medicine dealer..." and then started chatting about this and that.</p>
<p>"Hey, don't be offended, I said, what kind of medicinal materials are there these days? People don't even have any pancakes left. Are you still taking medicine? In the ambush this year, you don't know, the villages are all infected with Wen Sha, but who is not like this, look: one or two days, they die, and they just dig a pool and bury them, who else..."</p>
<p>Someone interjected: "These days, there are dead ends everywhere."</p>
<p>"How could it not be? Really, the sky has also changed. I've lived for fifty or sixty years, and it's still so cold..."</p>
<p>In the corner of the room, there were another three or two people gambling with dice, and the noise was as chaotic as horses neighing.</p>
<p>"Hey, in this chaotic world, people's lives are not even worth a few dice..."</p>
<p>Everyone had a bit of a sad look; however, our group yawned, thinking that we still had to walk a lot of muddy roads when the sky was bright...</p>
<h3>Struggling in the Wind</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>When the leaves fall and the wind sweeps, a heavy fog floats into A Mao's mind—</p>
<p>"Heavens, it's so cold, the wind, attacking everything, whistling and rustling. How will we get through this harsh winter?"</p>
<p>At this, he despaired, various thoughts biting at his emotions.</p>
<p>"Cotton clothes, bedding, fire!" he thought, "This costs four or five days of work. How... Alas!"</p>
<p>"These past two days, my wife has a cold and can't get up, and our year-old child is coughing constantly: yes, they all lack things to keep them warm!"</p>
<p>"A doctor? Hmph, don't even think about it. The lives of the poor aren't their concern; they won't die..."</p>
<p>His head, dizzy and swollen, was filled with countless sparks leaping in his consciousness.</p>
<p>In a natural cycle, he became aware of a beautiful picture—</p>
<p>A lamp, bright, milky white, bathing a quiet, spacious room; a heater, appropriately regulating the cold air; cigarettes, lightly, wispily, curling; the radio reporting today's market prices:</p>
<p>—Margin deposit, opening price ×××× yuan...</p>
<p>In another cycle, he also longed for a place where the light didn't reach, where some animals whose faces were difficult to discern were crawling, huddled, shivering, withered leaves complaining in the wind:</p>
<p>—Animals, just wait, everything is destined for you in the north wind.</p>
<p>A chill struck him, startling him: the sound of "everything is destined for you in the north wind," like a loud bell, vibrated in his eardrums. At this, he thought of the power and posture of the north wind and the sorrow of a life like the setting sun in the west.</p>
<p>He was frightened, wanting to shout, wanting to run, but in the end, he laughed—chance illusions flashing before his eyes. He found that well-dressed pedestrians were surrounded, threatened, and hoped for by "destined strugglers" in the north wind.</p>
<p>Although it was an extremely deep trap, to him, it seemed like a flat avenue, lying quietly. He laughed, unable to stop laughing, endless heat surrounding him, stepping out of the door and onto the dim, long road.</p>
<p>Here, there, he dragged his thin, long shadow, accepting the encroachment of this north wind! Struggling with this north wind.</p>
<h3>About Winter Sweet</h3>
<p>— Luo Shan</p>
<p>Life is an endless cycle of melody, constantly turning the wheels. Another winter has arrived. People have become a confused machine. I have never had any good feelings about winter. I often think that winter should belong entirely to the bourgeoisie. It seems that we shouldn't have such a season?</p>
<p>Indeed, besides "snow," which I love from a poetic starting point, it has to be winter sweet. There is a special connection between winter sweet and me, an indelible relationship, as if my own mother had engraved an imprint in my heart that is the same.</p>
<p>There are two winter sweet trees in my yard. Every winter, when they just start to bud, I am busy picking them, but my mother never allows it. Once, I was so angry that I cried, and she reluctantly cut off three or four branches with small scissors and put them in a large vase on the long table, which was filled with globe amaranth and bamboo branches. While putting the flowers in, she pulled me,</p>
<p>"Child, your father won't allow you to break them either. You understand this is all for your own happiness that he loves them."</p>
<p>At the time, I really didn't understand why. My little heart always felt that my parents mysteriously regarded the winter sweet by the court as a miracle. It wasn't until I was ten years old that I realized that the winter sweet, which had not bloomed for more than twenty years, suddenly bloomed in full bloom the year I was born. Therefore, because they cherished their daughter, they cherished the winter sweet, and my position became even better because I was a "lucky omen."</p>
<p>Although since my parents cultivated me with a university education, I have become more unfortunate. At the same time, because of that so-called misfortune, I have not fulfilled my parents' expectations. I have not dared to go back for four or five years, and I am ashamed to see my parents who are eagerly waiting for me at the door. However, every winter, the winter sweet, which is cold-resistant and blooms alone in the frost and snow, has not interrupted my enthusiasm for visiting them. This year, the whip of life has forced me to be in K land. The Gu Mountain, which is full of avenues, is a golden color. When the sun occasionally peeps out from the cloudy sky. My friends and I endured the piercing cold and finally walked alone in Gu Mountain in West Lake. My nose smelled the fresh fragrance, and my age seemed to be going backwards, and my childhood was revived before my eyes. My right hand patted the one in full bloom, and my heart was praying silently.</p>
<p>"If your friends, the couple who grew up in my family, are really a symbol of my good fortune, then in the new year of the lunar calendar, please give me all the success. Of course, I don't hope for wealth, just to be able to live an ordinary life without worrying about life."</p>
<p>So I laughed loudly to myself, which made my friends laugh too, but their laughter was different from mine.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shenbao in this City: Automobile Weekly</p>
<p>Automobile News</p>
<h3>Remarkable Progress of the British Automobile Industry in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Shadow Stays</p>
<p>Vauxhall and Standard Export the Most</p>
<p>In the past year, the British automobile factories have made remarkable progress in terms of business. Therefore, the export volume has suddenly increased a lot. In terms of value, the income has generally increased by £1,000,000. In terms of exports, the majority are shipped to New Zealand and Australia. After the British authorities recently decided to reduce automobile taxes, the car factories can also manufacture high-horsepower cars at the same time. As a result, the progress of the automobile industry and the promotion of overseas markets will be inevitable. In the past twelve months, the total number of passenger cars produced was 256,866, while the total number in the previous year was only 220,779. As for trucks, 85,633 were produced in the past year, while only 65,508 were produced in the previous year. This shows that the output of passenger cars and trucks from British automobile factories in the last year has increased compared to previous years. Among the business conditions of various car factories, the most developed is Vauxhall. At the end of the year, news came that the factory had made so much profit that the shareholders' dividends increased by 75% compared to the previous year. A total of £261,562 in dividends were distributed. Vauxhall's lightweight six-cylinder cars are the most sold overseas. People from all countries who travel to the UK are happy to buy them after seeing Vauxhall's amazing results. Therefore, Vauxhall's sales overseas have reached as many as 67 countries. News from Coventry is that the Standard Car Factory sold more vehicles in the last year than ever before in the factory's history. Based on the current situation, it can be said that there will be new records in the next year. Since the founder of the Standard Factory, Mr. Motorsley, passed away not long ago, the internal organization has undergone slight changes. Mr. Pender was elected chairman to replace Motorsley's position on the board of directors, and Mr. Herbert will soon serve as the sales manager. He is Motorsley's brother-in-law and has served in the Standard Factory for many years. Mr. Black will continue to serve as the manager and guide.</p>
<p>When we discuss the export situation of British car factories in the past year, there is one more thing that should be mentioned to the readers, that is, the number of aircraft engines produced by Rolls-Royce Factory in the last year was particularly large. Most of them were purchased by Belgium and used to equip passenger planes. However, many were also used to equip fighter bombers. Because of the outstanding speed of this engine, countries such as the Netherlands, Portugal, and Denmark have also ordered them one after another. Recently, during an automobile race held in Slough, a vehicle suddenly caught fire, and the result was extinguished by asbestos. Therefore, the value of using asbestos in British automobiles was also proven. In recent years, there have been occasional incidents of car fires caused by collisions or other reasons during driving, and even incidents of injury and death. However, after this fire, covering the flames with a piece of asbestos cloth immediately extinguished them. Therefore, we also know the fire-resistant performance of asbestos.</p>
<p>Recently, there were two ships of British-made commercial vehicles. These vehicles are all the latest products. The following vehicles are sold overseas. The British Columbia Electric Railway Bureau in Vancouver purchased an AEC Ranger public bus equipped with an AEC Ricardoo diesel engine for use in the colony. In the past, many similar vehicles used gasoline engines, but diesel engines are still a first. In December, the Milan Italian Public Bus Company ordered an AEC electric engine single-deck public bus. The chassis of this car is type 662, and the horsepower emitted by the motor can reach 80 horsepower. The South African Tram Company also ordered 50 public bus chassis, 30 of which will be used to assemble double-deck public buses, and 20 will be used to assemble single-deck buses. They are all equipped with re-generators and resistor brakes, which are products of the Lysholm Factory.</p>
<p>The British Birkenhead Company owns more than 100 operating public buses, most of which are products of the Leyland Factory. Due to the use of this type of car in the past year, the operating profit reached as much as £22,000. The London Transportation Authority, in view of the amazing achievements of British-made public buses in the past, has also allocated £5,000,000 in the budget for the exclusive purpose of removing part of the old tram tracks and switching to public buses. In the future, this expense will be allocated annually, limited to £28,000,000. In the past year, there has been a trend of using internal combustion engines in the railway bureau in the UK. The uneconomical nature of steam trains has become an obvious fact. This is true not only in the UK but also in other countries. For example, the engines manufactured by the British Thornycroft Factory are used by South America and Poland. Regarding this matter, we can point out to the readers that the advantages of the transmission system in the engine are numerous. Among the most significant are the Waszynski-Sinclair torque converter and the Italian torque converter replacing the usual clutches and gearboxes. During driving, there is an outstanding acceleration force from beginning to end. During movement, there is absolutely no vibration to disturb passengers. All parts are also more economical than in the past. These engines and torque converters are installed in the chassis and can be adapted to various other vehicles. Because there is no vibration during driving, the excellent performance cannot be achieved by ordinary engines.</p>
<h3>Hudson and Terraplane New Cars Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>With Two Major New Advances</p>
<p>Steel Car Top and Electric Gear Shift</p>
<p>The 1935 Hudson and Terraplane new cars are displayed in the showrooms of the local agents, Levy Auto Company and Longfei Auto Company, for public viewing. The new cars have a lower and longer appearance than before. The engine power is more substantial than before, and their operating efficiency is even better. The new cars have two major new advances in the automotive industry: steel top car body and electric gear shift. Because they are equipped with steel tops, passengers can sit comfortably in a solid and quiet steel car compartment, while also enjoying the best and most perfect ventilation. As for the electric gear shift, it clears the entire front compartment, and the driver can obtain the convenience of true fingertip control.</p>
<p>For the 1935 production year, Hudson Motor Car Company decided to manufacture a special group and a luxurious group of Terraplane six-cylinder cars with a wheelbase of 112 inches. The entire group of Hudson cars has three wheelbases: 116 inches, 117 inches, and 124 inches. The Hudson Large Six-Cylinder is a new product for 1935, equipped with a 93-horsepower engine on a 116-inch wheelbase chassis. The Hudson Luxurious Eight-Cylinder has five styles, with a wheelbase of 117 inches and 113 horsepower. In addition, there are two styles of Hudson Eight-Cylinder cars: the General Style Sedan and the General Style Brougham Sedan. Both have a wheelbase of 124 inches and 113 horsepower.</p>
<p>Another most notable of the new car's advances is the redesigned braking system. The brake drums are now made of a special alloy steel and precision machined. The cross-section has increased by 20%, making it extremely strong. In addition, due to the use of a new type of rotary equalizer, the brake pressure applied to the brake shoes is absolutely equal. As for the selection of gears, it is electric and easy to use. Since the shift lever has been abolished, in order to make the front position clearer, the hand brake on various cars has been moved from the center of the front compartment to another position, that is, below the car neck part of the right side dashboard. As a result, the position is vacant and unobstructed, and its application is more convenient than the original position.</p>
<p>The exterior of the new car's body, its strong and solid structure, and its decoration and equipment have all made great progress. Its magnificent form, graceful posture, are extremely beautiful and pleasing to the eye, and very moving. The all-steel roof is indeed a part of the entire structure of the car body, tightly welded and extremely strong. The strength of the new car has reached its peak and is unmatched. All styles of new cars are equipped with a new ventilation system, making people feel extremely comfortable inside. As for the car body style, there are a total of twenty-six styles, which can be equipped with four groups of Hudson and two groups of Terraplane.</p>
<p>The illustration shows the 1935 Hudson and Terraplane new cars, equipped with electric gear shift. The driver only needs to flick with a finger to adjust the gear, so there is no need to move the hands holding the steering wheel.</p>
<h3>Automobile Statistics for the British and French Concessions in This City</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The automobile registration statistics for the Shanghai Public Concession during the winter of last year were reported in a previous issue. Now, we will select and record the recent situation of automobile usage in Shanghai, as well as the automobile registration counts for the Public Concession and the French Concession, as reported in Western newspapers, for reference.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 1934, the combined automobile registrations for the Shanghai American and French Concessions totaled 16,793 vehicles. Adding the automobiles used solely in the Chinese areas, the total number of automobiles in the Greater Shanghai area should exceed 17,000. The automobiles used by the various foreign troops stationed in Shanghai are not included in these figures. As of December 31, 1933, the automobile registration number for the Shanghai American and French Concessions was 1-</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>6,631 vehicles.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 10,350 automobiles in use in the Public Concession, compared to 9,815 vehicles one year prior. In the year before that, December 31, 1932, there were 9,000 vehicles. This shows an increase in the past two years. At the same time, the number of automobiles in use in the French Concession is less impressive, with 6,443 vehicles as of December 31, 1934, compared to 6,816 vehicles one year prior. Furthermore, currently in the Public Concession there are 6,983 privately owned automobiles and 4,160 in the French Concession. The number of freight vehicles in use in the Public Concession is 2,102 and in the French Concession is 1,602. The respective numbers of motorcycles are 717 and 124, and the numbers of taxis are 520 and 513.</p>
<p>The comparison of Shanghai automobile registrations by brand in the British and French Concessions between 1933 and 1934 is as follows:</p>

<h3>The Greatly Improved New Dodge</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The 1935 new Dodge automobile, outstanding in content, appearance, and every other aspect, has attracted great attention from people in the automobile industry since its arrival here and its exhibition by the local dealer, China Motor Company. The advantages of the new car are too numerous to mention. For example, its driving comfort is exceptional, it is exceptionally economical and cost-effective, its streamlined body is beautifully moving, its value is astonishing, and its power is even more abundant and full. These are all its salient features. The new car is spacious and grand, unprecedented in the past. As for the mechanical and body aspects, there are as many as ninety-five fundamental improvements. In addition, all the well-known characteristics for which Dodge has enjoyed a unique reputation for years of strong and reliable service, such as the all-steel safety body, the floating engine mounts, and the Dodge hydraulic brakes, are all included.</p>
<p>In addition to the completely redesigned center of the car, the various well-researched reforms include the Dodge high-compression engine, harmonic front wheel suspension, ventilation clutch, harmonic transmission, superior hydraulic brakes, and various engine and chassis features. According to the new car, some management operations, which in the past had to be performed by the driver, are now completely automatic. These special features are the result of the above-mentioned improvements.</p>
<p>The interior of the car is particularly comfortable, thanks to the perfect ventilation system that provides clear visibility. As for the special front wheel suspension, its structure is excellent, needless to say. Now, the weight supported by the car's springs has been redistributed, so its effectiveness is even more impressive. The so-called redistribution method moves the position of the prime mover eight inches forward, and the rear seat of the sedan, which was previously placed on the rear wheel arch, is moved six inches forward. Therefore, all passengers are seated exactly between the wheel arches, and the comfort they experience is incomparable to that of ordinary car seats. Speakers believe that Dodge products have always been known for their safety and reliability throughout the world. Now that the new car has so many advantages, it will be even more loved by the world, and it is undoubtedly worth buying.</p>
<h3>Seven Horsepower Austin Breaks New Train Record</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>According to a Melbourne news report, a specially made Bendigo to Melbourne express train recently completed its journey in two hours and nineteen minutes. At the time, the general public was extremely impressed with this achievement, as the fastest scheduled time for this route was three hours and five minutes.</p>
<p>However, the new record set by the new train was broken by a small Austin in no time. After learning of the above news, Mr. Dickason, the owner of the Austin dealership in Melbourne, drove a two-seater sports-style seven-horsepower Austin at high speed between Bendigo and Melbourne. After safely arriving at his destination, he calculated the time spent, which was half an hour less than the record set by the new train. Afterwards, the railway authorities, feeling unwilling that the express train's record was broken by a small Austin so quickly, specially ran the train again a few hours later, hoping to set a new high record. However, although the result was ten minutes faster than its first record, it was still much inferior to the small Austin. Austin ultimately took the lead by 19 and a half minutes. The fuel consumption for the entire journey was one shilling and six pence per passenger, while the first-class train fare was twenty shillings and two pence per passenger.</p>

<h3>Secrets of Movie Star Success as Told by Mary Pickford (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Mi Tong</p>
<p>"If you want to make a name for yourself on the silver screen, if you don't have a high school diploma, if you don't have fashionable clothes, if you don't have the financial means to support yourself for six months, if you don't have a clear, pleasing voice, and unlimited perseverance, you'd better not go to Hollywood." The above is the advice of Mary Pickford, the "American Sweetheart" and world-renowned movie queen. Her status, authority, reputation, and experience naturally add considerable weight to what she says.</p>
<p>"If a woman, regardless of all opposing advice, is determined to try her luck in this overcrowded film city, then she should at least make full preparations beforehand, the longer the better. Even while in school, she should practice her voice and speech. A coarse voice is most likely to cause unpleasant feelings and is a great obstacle to her future. Often a woman with a beautiful face is affected because her speaking voice is unpleasant. A soft and steady voice is easy to create a good impression." What is said above is not just old talk. Mary Pickford still practices speaking three times a week. Given her status, she still does this, which shows how important a person's speech and articulation are.</p>
<p>The art of observation cannot be ignored. Before leaving for Hollywood, you should first practice your memory so that it is like a camera, never forgetting what it sees. Because when it comes to reciting lines, if you don't have a strong memory or forget them on the spot, it's a very dangerous thing. Performing in school is very beneficial to gaining stage experience. Regularly reading poetry and reciting famous speeches are also good ways to practice yourself. Of course, the theatrical experience gained in school can help you immensely in the future, so if there are performance opportunities in school, never be shy or timid.</p>
<p>"Dancing can correct your posture, harmonize your movements with the rhythm, and make you appear graceful and confident when walking in front of the public. Therefore, you should learn and master every form of dance. The knowledge of dance is an indispensable condition on the path to becoming a star. Of course, you should also know some swimming and horse-riding techniques. However, although these two techniques are also very important and it is best to know some, they are not as important as dancing. Because swimming and horse riding can be done by doubles, but dancing is of great benefit to one's physical form and cannot be replaced by others."</p>
<p>"As for clothing, a woman who is just starting out in Hollywood should have at least two evening gowns and countless sets of everyday clothes in her wardrobe. In fact, the more clothes a woman has, the better. If your financial resources are insufficient to prepare many clothes, you'd better not go to Hollywood." "Don't go to Hollywood" is what Mary Pickford has repeatedly stated. The streets of Hollywood are already filled with penniless aspiring movie stars. They are worried about where their next meal will come from, let alone having money to buy clothes.</p>
<p>"When a woman first arrives in Hollywood, she should not live in a hotel or apartment. She should live in a private home. Private homes are not only more economical, but also more comfortable. It is best if there are young people in the family who can socialize with. Hollywood is a very lonely place, and if you lack friends, if there are young men and women in the same residence, they can help you pass the lonely time and can take you out to socialize, and often in these social events, you will encounter opportunities. Of course, socializing has certain limits and should not be indiscriminate."</p>
<p>"If you arrive in Hollywood and cannot find suitable work in the first week or two, you must not be discouraged. You must clench your teeth and not change your original intention. You should continue to visit all the major companies every day, regardless of whether there is anything to do or not. You may run around in vain for several months with no results, but the possibility always exists, or the opportunity may come tomorrow. Even in my own case, when I first entered the film industry, the old Biograph Company removed my name four times. It wasn't until the fifth time that they gave me the opportunity to be on camera—but at that time, Hollywood was still a sparsely populated place. The situation is even different now. So, if you are prone to disappointment, it is best not to go to Hollywood." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "We're Rich Again"</h3>
<p>— Ya Fu</p>
<p>Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>We're Rich Again</p>
<p>Some movies can be understood from their titles, such as the translated title of this film, needless to say. And the original title, "We're Rich Again," also explains the vulgarity of the work.</p>
<p>Generally, people who watch movies often know that the new movies that are changed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays are rarely good, and this time "We're Rich Again" is no exception.</p>
<p>This film is adapted from a stage play, which may make lovers of literature and art feel excited, but the result did not live up to expectations. This film has no better achievements in terms of content or form. First of all, the story is vulgar. We simply doubt that this film has a theme. If it does, then it is selling a daughter to save poverty, and eventually getting windfall and suddenly becoming rich.—What a vulgar concept!</p>
<p>There are many people on stage here, but they are all for the construction of an ungainly story, rather than for increasing the expression of the play. In fact, the story is unprincipled and uncentered, using some coincidences and encounters as materials to induce laughter and piecing them together, but unfortunately, it loses the effect of laughter.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the mediocre surgery of the director is the reason why this film cannot succeed. In addition to not having many mistakes in the connection, the grasp of the personality of the characters in the play, many scenes are expressed with objects (such as the bride's reading, etc.). But this is what makes us as annoying as we hate the swimming men and women. The role Olive plays here has almost lost humanity. Marlene Nesson is also very unsuitable for the personality of the characters in the play. The better thing is the acting of Bollie Burke, who played the housewife in "Dinner at Eight," which is quite worthy of appreciation.</p>
<h3>The Great Musical Display in "The Gay Divorcee"</h3>
<p>— Guo Cheng</p>
<p>Standing from a musical point of view, "The Gay Divorcee" can be called the most promising product of this season.</p>
<p>Five world-renowned arrangers appear here: "Night and Day" was written by Cole Porter; "Don't Let it Bother You" was a collaboration between Gordon and Revel; "The Continental" and "Looking for a Needle ina Haystack" are entirely the work of Con Conrad and Herb Magidson; "Knock Kneez" is a collaboration between Gordon and Revel.</p>
<p>Gordon and Revel have composed songs for "Broadway Through a Keyhole", "We're Not Dressing", "Here Comes the Bride" and many other famous films on the screen.</p>
<p>Conrad and Magidson co-composed the music for the currently popular film "Yes Sir I Love Your Daughter." Conrad has independently composed songs for films such as "MemoryLane", "Marge", "Lonesomeand Sorry" and "Cha mpagne Waltz".</p>
<p>It is very gratifying that fifty beautiful dancing girls appear in the RKO-Radio musical comedy "The Gay Divorcee". Each girl is not only beautiful and has a proper appearance, which conforms to the posture when dancing, and she also needs to undergo a careful physical examination in advance.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Shirley Temple</h3>
<p>— Qi Xiang</p>
<p>Everyone who sees the little star Shirley Temple finds her lovable! Now I will write down some trivia about her below, maybe many people would like to know.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple is the only Hollywood star whose contract stipulates sleep time. Other child stars only stipulate that they must have sufficient sleep time, but Shirley Temple's contract stipulates that she must sleep for at least nine hours every day.</p>
<p>Shirley's current hope is to be a barber when she grows up. She seems to have a special interest in the barbering business, and every day when she has free time, she goes to watch Aline Bear, the Fox Company barber, work. She also takes her doll as an experimental product, combing her hair. Of course, this is just a child's fantasy, and it will soon change. Before, her greatest hope was to be a vegetable vendor, but it didn't take long for her to change.</p>
<p>Although Temple can't recognize many words yet, she receives more letters from fans than any star in Hollywood. She now averages 4,000 letters a week (most of which are letters just learned to write by children), so Shirley Temple has now hired a secretary to reply to the letters for her.</p>
<p>Shirley now lives in Hollywood in the former Lillian Harvey's house. Fox Company specially invited many designers to redecorate it for her. Everything is suitable for children's psychology and temperament. It is very simple and elegant. The walls are painted with funny cartoons such as "Mickey Mouse" and "Three Little Pigs". Shirley's new film "Little Miss Marker" was filmed after she moved into this house.</p>
<p>Shirley's old partner James Dunn is now writing a film novel. The book is based on Shirley Temple and realistically depicts this lovely little star. When the book is released and the film is filmed, we can see their collaboration on the screen again.</p>
<h3>Will Charlie Chaplin Really Speak?</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin has been separated from the screen for a long time. But now he's shooting a new film. According to people who know some of the content, once that film is released in the future, it can break all previous box office records.</p>
<p>That new film is now being filmed hard, and everything is shrouded in an atmosphere of mystery. And some people say that when it is released in the future, the advertising strategy will use the slogan "Chaplin Speaks!" Audiences are impulsed by curiosity, and everyone will want to go and see. However, according to the news revealed by people who know the content, Chaplin does not speak, or at most says some monosyllabic words, which are not enough to be considered dialogue due to the lack of expression. But many workers are working day and night, rushing to build a sound photography studio at Chaplin's venue. This matter has attracted the attention of many people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the name of that new film is currently tentatively named (“The Wai ”) (Wild Child). It may be changed in the future. The film will probably be completed in about six months.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>National Voice (Bordertown) (5)</h3>
<p>— Xuemei</p>
<p>One important thing Johnny Ramirez wanted to do that night was to negotiate with Chili Luke and ask him for a quarter of the profits. He knew it was definitely possible because he knew Chili Luke couldn't live without him. But he didn't have to meet Mary Luke all the time after that, because Chili took the day's income home every night and hid it in a wall cabinet, and then handed it over to the bank the next day when the bank opened. After Chili later had to go out, Johnny took over the job and had to go to Luke's house every night.</p>
<p>The living room of the Luke's house was dimly lit, with only a foot lamp emitting some soft light behind the sofa. That day, Johnny walked into the Luke's house, and Mary had already been waiting for him on the sofa in advance, seeing the contours of Mary's body from the soft light. When Mary saw Johnny coming in, she said in a soft and charming voice: "I knew Chili would tell you to send the money home every night, so I didn't go out with him."</p>
<p>Johnny didn't say a word and slowly walked towards the wall cabinet. After a while, the foot lamp went out, and the room was as dark as ink, with only faint morning light jumping from the gap under the curtains. In this dimness, Johnny heard Mary's gasping voice, calling his name. Suddenly the room lit up again, because Johnny had already touched the light switch. He said to Mary: "Hey, you understand. I have nothing against you, we can get close. But... Chili... we are colleagues... we have a good relationship. If I have an affair with his woman, what kind of person am I?" The two were silent, and Johnny slowly put the money into the wall cabinet. After a while, Mary said: "There will be a day, you see." Johnny didn't say anything and left, leaving Mary alone, laughing coldly to herself.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, there are many ways to kill a cat. For example, a big fat man, drunk as mud, is driven home by a woman who is annoyed with him. She drives the man straight into the garage, and pushes him, but he doesn't wake up. She couldn't help but feel frustrated when she looked at his bloated and unresponsive shape. Suddenly, he suddenly had an idea. She gritted her teeth and made a decision. She quietly left the car, the car was not turned off, and the gasoline was still burning. She gently closed the door of the garage and went into the house alone.</p>
<p>The next morning, Mary Luke cried bitterly and told the police everything that had happened. She said: "Mr. Luke was sitting in the back of the car. He was drunk as mud. And he was so fat. Of course I didn't have the strength to catch him out. Besides, he is often like that. He is often drunk. But before, he often woke up by himself, got out of the car by himself, and walked into the house by himself. Who knew this time..." Speaking of this, she was already sobbing. After listening to her, the police officer couldn't help but sigh for her. Such a young and beautiful woman has become a lonely and helpless widow, so he advised her: "Okay. The person is already dead. It's useless for you to be sad in vain. Besides, this case is very clear, he died of carbon monoxide poisoning from gasoline asphyxiation. I'm sorry, for the sake of the law, I have to ask you, please don't be sad."</p>
<p>Mary thus became a widow, a free widow. But why does she want to be free? She and Johnny are now partners. But to Mary's surprise, since Chili Luke died, Johnny has become more distant from her. Sometimes, when Mary begged to come, he would send her home, but he would just send her to the door. He never went in with her. She bored him. No matter how she asked, he ignored her. He pretended not to understand her attitude. He was more determined than before and didn't want to mix with her. He had more important things in his mind. (To be continued)</p>
