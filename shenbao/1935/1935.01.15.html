<p>日來論歐洲大局者。莫不集中視綫於蕯爾問題。誠以薩爾一地。雖廣不逾七百三十平方哩。而主權誰屬。則久已爲法德間百餘年來糾紛之重心。茲旣依據歐戰和約之規定。付諸七十八萬人民（投票公民約爲五十五萬）之公意决定。以了此一椿公案。姑無論投票之結果何若。固必遠勝於訴諸武力解决的最後一方法也。其爲値得我人大書特書。自無疑義。雖然。由此一投票。而卽謂歐洲大局之和平。可循是而奠其基礎。則未免太覺樂觀焉。</p>
<p>夫歐洲大局和平之動向。實繫於法德兩强間勢力之均衡。區區薩爾一地主權之解决。形式上雖似足使法德問爭執之目的。爲之消失。實則法德間對立之緊張形勢。是否可稍和緩。或竟由此加深一層尙未可知。蓋薩爾之爲地。富於重工業之一切資源。他姑勿言。卽以煤鐵二項論。實爲該地最富饒之產物。而法德雙方又皆認爲發展重工業必需之品。故無論主權誰屬。俱足以影響兩國競爭之前途。况乎按和約規定。德縱能於投票方式之下。獲得物歸故主之勝利。然地下之鑛藏。猶須備價贖還。以今日德國經濟之困難。其足以充分負擔此贖還之欵項歟。法國能减價以遷就之歟。前據報載。價値雖略規定。然恐不能如是之容易。此問題不解决。卽難保不再起糾紛。故僅由薩爾投票以論歐洲和平之發展。有未可輕易樂觀者焉。</p>
<p>抑嘗論之。法德兩國之衝突。實非僅薩爾一問題已也。德國之極力擴張海陸軍備。尤足使法國認爲於覇權上大感威脅。是以裁軍會議破裂之後。德國退出日内瓦湖。畔之國聯。對方卽進行聯絡中歐。以及蘇聯各國。構成以反德爲中心之大包圍陣綫。益陷备國於死中求活之一途。故此軍備問題而不解决。卽能因薩爾問題之解决而各釋然乎。所幸自倫敦羅馬兩政府活動以來。此種法德對峙之局勢。似已有一變面貌之傾。嚮羅馬恊定之精神。旣使法國有不必遠求於蘇聯之勢。復可使多腦河流域之法國勢力圈無對德不安之虞。益以倫敦政府之提携。足以使柏林當局。不但可以加入保奧獨立之多腦河恊定。且可以享有和約中軍事條欵廢止之實惠。果爾。則德國之軍備。得因英國之調解而有合法希望。法國之凡爾賽體系。亦以英意之同意而日增安全。英人此種主張而如果完全達到。亦可使歐局稍形穩定矣。不過此中尙有不可忽視者。卽法國於德國軍備擴張合法化以後。對於法國之安全。可以維持至若何限度。此不獨法國於法蘇關係尙在發展中須刻刻注意之事卽於法德兩强之對立。能否調和如倫敦政府建議之所想像。亦爲一大可考慮之問題也。</p>

<p>滬甬爭潮、已告一段落、昨日四公司已在恊訂繼續合作之公約、惟航綫將突變爲滬鎭路矣、亟將情形再述如下、以明眞象（明興可航長江）三北新輪明興號、四公司公議之下、將根本不行寗波航路、但在各輪修理之際、明興輪得以正式加人滬甬綫、以爲代替、而於明興輪之將來正式航路、則爲行駛滬漢間之長江班、依此原則、由各公司續議滬甬輪之繼續合作、該項公約、正在磋商會訂中、</p>
<p>（招商亦行鎭海）此次因滬甬爭航而引起鎭海航埠之互相開駛、蓋鎭海爲内地口岸、往來貨物、槪可免納關稅、三北已商准稅務司准予照辦、則此後寗波貨、將改由陸運至鎭海轉輪、得享免稅之利、招商局對於此項辦法、亦决計派新江天輪行駛、寗紹公司新寗紹亦同此辦法、以後滬甬綫内各輪、將變爲滬鎭綫、寗波變成兼行之埠、在營業上無足輕重矣、</p>
<p>（英輪營業落後）本來寗波班内、四公司營業、以太古公司最巨、素來占第一位、自合作以來、彼雖占十一分、而仍年年有攤出、分發與成數不足之各公司、今因明興爭潮、一轉移間、變成航路之變遷、寗波一處、將成爲旅客上落之埠、滬甬來去之貨、從此漸改鎭海裝卸、客家貨主可减免關稅甚巨、但太古爲洋商輪、不能在内地口岸鎭海停泊運貨、因之新航綫開行後、英輪營業、行將落後、此誠出於意外也、</p>

<p>（蘇敎廳長周佛海在省府紀念週報告）</p>
<p>江蘇社會敎育、近二年來、頗有進展、據最近的統計、江蘇全省各縣、用於社會敎育的經費、共計有一·三九六·一二四元、省敎育經費用於社會敎育方面的、亦有五六七·四六二元、兩共一·九六三·五八六元、各縣所辦的社會敎育機關、共計有民衆敎育館一五一年、農民敎育館一四一所、圖書館四十一所、體育塲七十所、民衆敎育實騐區十七所、民衆閱報處四七五所、其他社敎機關一二一所、共計有一零一五所、各縣有民衆學校一六五一校、一二二五級、共有學生七Ｏ一二八人、比較十九年度和二十年度、已有很多的增加、因爲那時全省各縣社會敎育經費只有一百三十一萬有零、各縣只有民衆敎育館一百三十餘所、農民敎育館八十餘所、·········其他各機關也沒有現正多、但是江蘇用了這許多錢、辦了這許多機關、其設施的情形怎樣、效果怎樣、今後應該如何的改進、應該切實的檢查一下、現在分别報告如下、</p>
<p>當我個人初到江蘇來的時候、有好多人對於江蘇社會敎育表示不滿意、說社會敎育機關只是拿錢不做事、好像是養老的機關、我把各縣社會敎育的視察的報告翻開來看、知道這些批評、的確有許多是事實、經過了多方的觀察、我才知道江蘇社會敎育所以那樣疲弊的、有四個重要原因、第一是社會敎育機關的事業範圍太廣、且無一定的標準、以致開始的時候、什麽事都要做、結果一樣事業都　做不成功、第一過去社會敎育機關經費的支配、無具體的標準、以致全部經費、大多用於薪工方面、事業就無從舉辦、第三過去社會敎育機關的服務人員、對於自己所負的責任、多半無澈底的認識、以致工作不免錯誤、第四過去敎育行政機關、對於社會敎育、只注意盡量的擴充、對於質的改善、未能十分注意、以致因循敷衍、成爲習慣、因爲我知江蘇社會敎育疲弊的原因、所以當局時便决定以行政的力量、來注间充實、整頓·考核·等工作、當時並决定了三個要點、第一確定社會敎育機關經費分配的標準、就是薪工不得高於百分之五十、事業費不得低於百分之四十、行政费作百分之十、務使各機關所舉辦的事業、得先後舉辦、第一製訂各縣社會敎育機關主任及職員服務細則及考核規程等重要法規、並嚴令社會敎育機關主任人員及職員不得兼職、務使各社會敎育機關於本區社會敎育的普及與推廣、都要負責去規畫和實施、本區内其他各社會敎育機關、並須負責指導、各中心機關更要互相聯絡、共謀全縣社會敎育的改進、這種辦法規定以後、各縣多能切實遵行、而各社會敎育機關、亦很能自知奮勉、力謀改進、現在有好多縣份、已經每一個自治區設一個社敎中心機關、還有些縣份因爲經濟的關係尙未辦到、以後還要分年推設、以期完成、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請柬投靠情殷</p>
<p>李士廉等着他在知單上，已經寫了字，交走了，這才笑道：說到多情，那還算是程先生。雖然送了他們兩塊錢，什麽好處也不想，乾乾凈凈的就是送兩塊錢他們度命。這呌施恩不望報，除了上年歲的人，眞正去修行的，那裏能作的到？程先生爲人實在是可以佩服。他說着這話，兩隻手同伸出來，同竪兩個大拇指。程志前笑道：要說是多情人，我不承認。若說我是多事人，我是承認的。說着望了王北海，正想呌他拿帶來的算草。李士廉却不願馬上就走開，至少要探聽探聽他和高廳長的關係怎麽樣，便帶上鞠躬的形勢，雖是坐着，身子也彎了一彎，笑問道：程先生到西安來，和我們東方來的人爭氣不少，到處都有人歡迎。你看，今天又有人請吃飯。到了我們，想問人家討一口飯吃，都　不可能，說起來豈不是慚愧之至？程志前笑道，這也算不了什麽。因爲這裏有兩位長官，是我的老朋友，輾轉介紹就認識得多了。作官的人，請客的事，是免不了的，請客的時候，多帶上我一個，毫無損失，豈不樂得而爲之？譬如今天晚上，是高鶴聲替袁有爲的介弟接風，一桌菜不能光請他兄弟兩個人吃，少不得多找個人去把桌子坐滿來。那麽，帶我們一個，不但不沾他什麽光，我們去了，還有和他帮忙的意味呢。這話可又說回來了，他肯要我們去帮忙，總算看得我起、要不然，請人帮忙吃飯，憑他在西安城裏的廳長資格，那是二等闊人，人家要趕去捧塲還來不及呢。（一一二）</p>

<p>這裏，曾經抹過我們同胞的殷紅的血，挨過暴日的砲火和炸彈，印過木屣的痕跡，，滿目的瓦礫和衰草，落日照在上面，流風吹起塵埃，那悽凉的樣子，會使人不禁地淌下淚來！沒有完整的房屋、祇是零亂與破碎的，殘廢的牆垣，焦黑的樓屋，全是大破壞的雰圍呵！悄悄的，慘慘的像這裏不是人的世界。</p>
<p>曾幾何時？而這裏已非那時的這裏了！看得見新的樓屋，很光滑的馬路、熙來攘往的行人；嗚嗚的車聲，又帶回這曾經一度死去了的都　市的情調。砰砰的在篾籬笆障住了的圍中，發出了得生的歌唱，那苦痛的傷痕，有些是在結疤而近愈了。</p>
<p>在夜裏，我們也看得見走動的霓虹燈，雖然這不比「租界」上，有那種不夜的街道，有歐洲人，有美洲人，有外國　三，也有日本窰子。還有。妖媚的眼睛·帶笑的臉，也有白的眼睛，頽喪的臉；可是在這裏一在這曾一度犧牲了的「閘北」，這中國人常常講的「中國地界」的上海市的北面的所在　，自然它也還可有些都市的氣質，雖然是趕不上那中國人常常說的「外國地界」那樣繁華，那樣熱鬧，但也還不差。雖說這初愈的病人，仍然欠缺了康健，然而總不會白勞了醫生手術的！</p>
<p>可是傷痕是遍滿全身，一二個創傷的結疤，是可治理的；但，這上面的恥辱的陰影，如何抹去？這可要問一問那些未死的同胞的！</p>

<p>虹口是上海日本的僑民區，不時看到彼邦僧侶，不敲木魚，但擊小鼓，乒乒乓乓，響個不停，憑着象形的臆度，自然是和國貨和尙化緣一般了；有人就稱他們爲洋和尙。洋和尙也是抱着死化的虔誠。往來在二百碼長短的沿路水門汀上；與中國和尙異同的，只是步伐疾徐有别，他們健步如飛，我們慢呑呑像黃牛耕田，僧侶們本沒有什麽民族界限，然而精神上，有了顯著畛域了。</p>
<p>最近又看到一個道地的洋乞丐耶穌聖誕！耶穌聖誕！敎徒們在址日以前，早就凖備着來一個熱烈的狂歌歡叙，綠衣使者，爲了聖誕節，工作加緊的忙碌，投遞祝福的賀片。百貨公司，爲了聖誕節，點綴了聖誕老人許多故事，爲自己的貨品作推鎖的廣告；就在這個時節，西國癟三，利用機會，化裝聖誕老人，在南京咱惠羅公司一帶，似乎本着耶穌救世的赤忱，爲各商店祝福；白白的長寗，飄拂胸際，銀髮滿頭，披戴紅巾，穿着嶄新丹色白邊的袍子；我從電車廂裏走馬看花般瞧過去，好像手裏拿着一枝粉筆，在商舖子玻璃窗橱上，大書祝福之詞！好奇的人們，跟着一大堆看熱鬧，還有兩名印捕，維護秩序，祝福詞寫好了，自然要來一個「伸手大將軍」！這正和内地廢歷十二月二十四夜，乞丐們預先假扮灶君沿街「跳灶王」一樣；嘴裏高喊着；「灶王到，老闆生意燥，」（按興隆之謂）左跳左發財！右跳右發財！不跳也發財！接上去三砲通，······通，······通；······吉利詞畢，也是「伸手大將軍；」不過假耶穌灶君做求乞的幌子，未免有些冐凟聖主神明的罪惡呢。</p>

<p>它們中間的距離大約在一尺半左右、但是要拉得更闊一些也行，更狹一些也未嘗不可，因爲它們都不用什麽東西栓住的，祗是懸空的掛着。我向它們端相了好一會，實在想不出它們究竟還是一種裝飾物，還是一種用具；如其是用具，那末做什麽用呢？後來我不能再忍耐了，便恭恭敬敬地向太后請問。</p>
<p>伊先朝着我很驕傲地一笑，這一笑之間，已很明顯地表示伊對於這件奇怪的東西，因爲多看書或多聽人家談論的關係，確已有了眞切的認識了；於是我就很注意地肅立而待、凖備接受伊的宏</p>
<p>「這東西當然是有它的用處的！」伊這第一句話總算先給我指示明白這是一種用具、不是一種裝飾品。「但要說明它的用處，」却非得先到後面去瞧一瞧不可！</p>
<p>說着，伊就向那看管這射圃的人一也算是一位官員一揮手示意，這人忙搶上幾步，走近那後戶邊去，伸手取掉了門上的栓子，反兩扇門一齊推開了，他自己又側着身子退了下去。我們的眼前，便湧現出一片長方形的空地來，它的盡頭，離我們所站的地方，足有三四十丈路遠。對面是一座絶高絶大的石牆，兩邊種着少許的樹木，和幾座小房子，想必就是看管這射圃的人的住屋。正中乃是一條五六丈寬闊的不舖石子的甬道；先前必是很平坦的，現在已長着很多的野草了。（二二二）</p>

<p>廣告，是商戰的必要武器，亦卽商店的第二生命。開店不論大小，苟不善於廣告，則貨雖山積，而問津無人，結果必因不堪虧蝕而關門大吉。因此一般商店，對於廣告，無不極端重視。惟是廣告之撰製，有因吹之過分，轉失讀者的信仰，亦有過於老實，毫無噱頭，因而失地廣告的效用，所以撰製廣告，的確不能不面面顧到。卽如天曉得皮貨局，刋登鉅幅的廣告，狂吹慘跌，跌進血本核心，倘然眞個成爲事實，恐怕其他的皮貨店，都要關門了。下走欲購皮衣一襲，因爲看見天曉得皮貨店的廣告，玄狐售價一千餘元，現售不到十分之二，不覺怦然心動，親往購買，不料看貨以後，大失所望！原來此較沒有跌進血本的皮貨局，祇有高昻，因此未敢榻此便宜，並因而聯想及於廣告，如果說得過於天花亂墜，非但不能吸引顧客，恐反足失却顧客的信仰，大家駡他一聲滑頭的天曉得！</p>

<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>世界上，美國的丈夫最好，日本的妻子最好，一這是盡人皆知的事實。</p>
<p>廚川白村在北美印象記裏告訴我們說：</p>
<p>「兩個人並着肩很親密帶着微笑走進來，在食堂裏坐在一定的位置，這是法國人，丈夫在前，兩手挿在袋裏，睨視左右，傲然挺胸而入，妻跟在後邊，這是英國式。現在，請看！在美國是尊夫人威儀堂堂的光臨，對於左右臣下賞看一眼，先就女王寳座，丈夫後來，這是美國風。」美國丈夫單祗這一點好嗎？回答的話是「否」。那麽請再多說一點。</p>
<p>要說美國丈夫的好，眞是好到異乎尋常，你不信，請看休假日的晚上，在家裏伴着小孩子玩，耐心地等候他的「親愛的」以至於夜深人靜的是男人還是女人呢？像我們中國的慣例；當然是女人，可是你說女人，那就錯了。原來女人到外面去交際，男人在家守候，那才是美國的慣例，也可說是鐵例，那是無可更動的。但是光祗等門就算了嗎？那還不是的。男人在守候憑你怎樣疲倦，幾乎要瞌睡，但祗要一聽得門鈴震響，立刻，便會興高采烈地走到門口去開門，門外走進來了華貴的妻子，於是讓伊先走、然後掩上大門，尾隨而進，走到室内，女人把脚一蹺男的便熟練地說；「是，親愛的。」說着便立刻把女人的弓鞋脫了下來，那時得要當心自己的鼻子，不要給鞋子碰着，因爲女人把脚蹺得太與男人的鼻子相近了啊。</p>
<p>上大街了，男人是尾隨在女人之後，得要抱着女人脫下的大衣，購買的貨物，有孩子的還得推孩子的睡車，女人的鞋帶解開了，也是要男人跑前兩步去扣起來的。</p>
<p>在家裏，自己女人跟朋友談話的時候，發言可沒有男人的份兒，要發言也得先請示女王，要求原恕。一凡此種種，多不勝記，好在我這裏寫的不是美國丈夫須知一類的文字，遺漏若干，料想還不致爲害。</p>
<p>那麽日本的妻子又怎樣的呢？那眞巧，恰恰與美國的妻子成了一圙對照。燒茶煮飯的，看管小孩洗衣掃地，······沒有一件不是女人的事，假如男子有客來，跪着端上香茶敬客是女人的事。把自己的褲子給丈夫當質了錢，而給男人去嫖婊子也是女人所不可反對的。</p>
<p>我曾經看過一篇最近刋於Ｔｒｕｅｗｔｏｔｙ上的「我嫁給一個日本人了。」那是一篇叙說一個美國女子嫁給日本男子，受盡了輕視苦難的一個故事，以一個美國的女子而過着日本妻的苦况，我們自然是可以想見的。</p>
<p>我們中國的夫妻是那一種呢？是丈夫做妻子的奴隸呢？還是妻子做丈夫的奴隸呢？那我們祇要對事實略一觀察，便可很爽快地回答；所謂潮流前頭的是美國他了，時代落伍者還是道地中國式的。（日本是我國徐福的子孫，故中國與日本是相近的。）孰是孰非，這是專門學者去研究的事，恕我祇盡了一點介紹的責任，不過在一個人結婚以前，還請先在肚裏把下一個底，你願意一個ＸＸ式的丈夫，或是做怎麽樣的妻？</p>

<h3 id="c228">文學與科學之相互浸透問題 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>把文學與科學互相地連繫起來，而使之相互浸透，這的確是目前的當面裹題；不過這裏所指的科學，並不是社學科學，而是自然科學，</p>
<p>使文學與社會科學相互緊連的問題，在從前似乎是闡明得够徹透了；因爲文學本是意議形態的下層基礎；而且在最近，從事於文學的創作，如果缺少了甚至於施之不用社會科學的方法，不用說這種文學作品，祗是種空中樓台而已。這種事實，很顯明地表示了文學與社學科學之不可分性，同時文學是社會科學的一部門，事實雖然很彰明，但最近的確還有人在談文學與社學科學的緊攙手，這當然並無遺憾，祗覺是「老生常談」而已。</p>
<p>至於把文學與自然科學互相地浸透的問題，我相信的確會有人覺着奇異的，以二種截然不同的方法，而使之鎔於一爐，並且相互透浸，看來的確無理而且怪訝，其實這祗是在於如何地處理自然科學而已；當然我們知道達爾文學生存競爭自然淘汰的生物進化論，不能够應用到社會科學上來、同時化學上的倍比定例等，不能够在文學的作品裏排起這種公式來，但我們相信，我們並不是這般機械，我們的主要目的，是在主題的整理。</p>
<p>自然科學的萬能，在目前已不成其爲疑問了，人類智識與文化的成長，靠着自然科學的發達，也愈更進展長成，今日的我們文學，并不是植根在空間的東西，我們的文學必須植根在現實的社會，并且要努力於使文化長成的任務。這樣地自然科學與文學，都努力於現代人類文化的成長。其目的旣相同，而祗是在方法與形式的相異而已。</p>
<p>高爾基曾經說「通俗的科學文學的建設、是對於一般的人們之文化敎育，所緊急不可缺的東西，文學的名匠，須輔助科學的實踐的名匠，以簡單的平易的形式，表現科學的思想理論與工作。」的確科學文學的建設，是科學與文學的相互浸透之濫觴，至於如何地建設，並且不抹殺了文學的自己的特性，則的確是應該究明的事件。</p>
<p>自然科學的確是苦燥而機械，沒有文學的感情，一個事物的抽象的眞理，獲不到讀者的喜，怒，哀，樂。所以爲着將科學的通俗的智識，敎育大衆，使之不感到苦燥與乏味，則利用文學的形式，以自然科學當素材，是最好的方法了；同時與這相反的以簢學當作背景，作爲一種裝飾，這是種最壞的傾向，這種傾向是完全將科學，科學者，科學者生活等，當作戀愛，死，結婚，家庭關係，個人問題等等的舊社會人的主題之背景而利用之，而不是將科學作爲是種小說的主題，這種例子在日本的文學作品中很多，像横光利一以礦物學學士爲主人公的「鳥」「博士」等，川端康成以精神科學爲背景的「慰靈歌」。可是像賴昻諾夫的「斯庫塔列夫斯基」之以技術的智識階級爲轉向的小說，並阿菲諾蓋諾夫之劇曲「恐怖」；描寫六十歲的生理學的衝動研究所所長柏露丁敎授，其克服哲學的觀念論之過程，并紀得之「法王廳的穴窟」内的博士愛梯姻等，雖亦以科學當背景，但較爲上乘的，這傾向雖不是科學文學的健全面，但還在水平線上的。</p>
<p>除了上述的取理法外，還必須提倡科學的空想小說，這種空想小說須依存科學的實騐的現實的資料的；高爾基說；「沒有武器的太古人的空想，是已豫見」了人間之飛於空中，潛於水裏，無阿地强化了陸上運動，變化物質等等的可能性；在我們的時代裏，空想與想像依存着科學的實騐之現實的資料，由了這空想，則能無限地强化了理性的創造力，我們知道，發明家們雖不「很」理解機械學，但他是努力地創造新理想的機械器具類的；我們需要幫助孩子們空想的科學文學，敎給孩子以思索未來。」</p>
<p>關於空想小說像Ｈ·Ｇ威爾斯諸作都是很佳的；但切忌犯了科學上的專門上的誤謬，並有被誇張了的羅曼蒂克的要素，向神秘主義的偏向等事件，像蘇聯的Ａ·耶羅斯拉夫斯基的「阿爾哥船的宇宙探險」卽犯了這些弊病。</p>
<p>科學文學不僅僅如斯地敎給一般人的思索未來，并且最要緊的是將過去自然科學的成果，與一般人以徹底的瞭解；利用了自然科學的理象，以文學的方法來說明，給宗敎以一最有利的壁壘，像「新約全書」等是充分地利用了；我們也要如此，但决不是學習牠那樣地荒譫，而是使之不神秘化，根據科學實踐的說明，給人類以一新的通俗的知識。</p>
<p>像以上所說的科學與文學的相互浸透問題，絶不是機械的把自然科學的内容，裝入文學之中，而是把自然科學成爲了淺易的素材，靠文學能廣大地敎養了衆人；也就是文學消化了自然科學的精髓，兩者合爲一，收穫了使人類文化成長的效果。現在這問題，在蘇聯已獲得很好的收效了。</p>
<p>至於有些人之提倡以自然科學方法來處理文學、描寫創作，以心理遺傳等等的分析，可獲得成功，我是覺得不同意的，如果如此，則茀羅衣特的心理分析就該成爲文學上底最好方法了，然而事實相反，我們的進步的方法却基立在社會科學上的</p>
<p>總之自然科學與文學的浸透，不是方法的問題，而是主題的取理問題。</p>
<h3 id="c229">雨夜速寫 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 笑鶩</p>
<p>如果拿貝多汶（Ｂｅｅｌｈｏｖｅｎ）交響曲裏的急奏來形容那一夜的雨勢，是再端當沒有了的。爲了生活苦悶。養成一種愛在雨天路天下獨個兒不帶雨具漫遊的癖，悶聲不響的撿着僻靜的路走，往往發現許多曉有诖意的奇境，弄得身上濕得像淚人似的回來，幾乎是常有的事情。那一夜，大雨下的燈苗都好像抖顫着，射出奇怪的光輝，當我走過愛文義路中段那幾家貼上了ＴＯＬＥＴ白紙條子的西式住宅門前，一眼瞥見那躱在街燈下的石階，花盆，窗檽，無一不像浴在月光下的奇景，差些兒驚呌起來，假如不是穿針引綫似的雨柱沒頭沒臉的揮灑下來，簡直再神肖沒有了。這使人懷想起持燈的女子那齣熱情的喜劇裏的温柔景象、以及中國舊小說裏常提到的香閨内院的環境。</p>
<p>可是，風吹着半啓閉的窗檽呦呦的嚮，裏面黑森森的彷彿有個什麽東西伏着，渾雜着寂寞與憂傷的情調，這似乎不是温柔美麗的環境了。另一種恐怖的感覺很快的襲上心來，好像這廢屋裏有着Ｔｈｅｈｏｎｓｅｍｌｉｖｅｄ那首詩裏的精靈在内　。在　ｐｅｒｃｙｒｃｂｉｎｓｏｎ的細語的邊廂裏，曾叙述一位藝術家在英國海岸旅館中發瘋，而把他太太絞死了的故事，這廢屋以前也許有過這種奇物的事情。這，不容再仔細想下去，已經够毛髮悚然了。</p>
<p>回到家來，彷彿還所見那窗檽呦呦的響，彷彿還想得出那幾家貼上了ＴＯＬＥＴ白紙條子的西式住宅門前的凄厲景象。</p>
<h3 id="c230">辨字與辨詞（四） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>客一一照你這樣說來，現代靑年的文章十全十美，半點也沒缺點了嗎？</p>
<p>主一一那又不盡然。現代靑年比前人進步是一件事，文章做得十全十美又是一件事。到了目前上海還有那些妄人在那裏廣播幼學瓊林呢；如不知辨字是一件事，辨詞又是一件事；秦以前是用字時代，辨字的工作極關重要。秦漢以後，由用字而轉向用詞，單講辨字，有舉　麽用處呢，不求詞的正確，單求字體的正别，對於靑年的國文程度有什麽益處呢？老兄起先說過「這不是靑年的國文程度退化了嗎？」的話，這「退化」一詞就是用錯的。你以爲「進化」就是「進步」，「退化」就是「退步」，那是完全錯誤的。「進化」（Ｅｖｏｌｕｔｉｏｎ）一詞，包含　着兩樣意思；一種單指那隨着時世而來的變化，這意味和「歷史」，「變遷」是完全一樣的。又一種是說那祖先子孫永久傳代中間性質的逐漸變化；所謂生物進化者，就是說現在生存的種種動植物，皆是由從前種種形體改變下來的結果。「進化」和「退化」並不包含變好變壞的意思。我們辨别詞義，應該說「這不是靑年的國文退步了嗎？」不能說「這不是靑年的國文程度退化了嗎？」最可笑的，到處流行「文明」一詞，結婚則有「文明結婚」，理髮則有「文明理髮」，戲劇則有「文明新劇」，再加以「文明辦法」，「文明舉動　」······無往而不「文明」；假如探問「文明」一詞的含　義，那就人人瞠目不知所對了。以我所知，「文公」「文明」的釋義，多少專門學者著爲專書還解釋不明白；　居然一張證書，兩個介紹人，一個證婚人，再加幾隻花籃，一隊軍樂，就說是「文明結婚」，豈非荒天下之大唐！中國文人，辨字「」而不辨「詞」，用典故而不知典故本義，由來已久。所以新名詞隨資本主義東來，也就不管三七二十一，停筆亂用。只要來自遠方，「洋火」，「洋油」，「洋燈」，「洋車」，「洋龍」，「洋狗」······無往而不「洋」；这只要是時髦，一自由布「」，「自由呢」，「衛生臭豆腐」，「衛生衣」，「幽默香水」，「摩登香皂」，無往而不「自由」，「衛生」，「幽默」，「摩登」；有一天，一位叫賣軋格林藥水的人在車廂裏高聲宣傳　，他說；「軋格林藥水這樣也可用，那樣也可用，」本公司爲推廣營業、在火車上叫賣，特别大减價，只賣小洋二角。諸位贊成不贊成？贊成的，買瓶試試看。「他所用「贊成」一詞，便是中」</p>
<p>時髦之毒，不曾了解「贊成」的含義的。</p>
<p>客一一舊文人用新名詞，固然用錯得很多；　舊文人用舊名詞，總該正確些了罷？</p>
<p>主一一那也不見得罷！凡是現代靑年所犯的籠統糢糊的毛病，都　還是沿襲舊文人而來的。章士釗笑白話不如文言，以「兩個桃子殺三個」讀書人不如「二桃殺三士」那麽簡明爲例，誰知他自己就不明白「二桃殺三士」那典故的本義。舊文人愛用「每况斯下」那一句成語。以爲「每况斯下」便是「一代不如一代」，殊不知莊子的原意正與之相反。舊文人愛用「阿堵」，「寗馨」，「期期」，「佳兵不祥」，「昊天不弔」，那些詞語，誰知他們全不了解原意，用起來無不錯誤。原來愛用典故的習氣，自建安以後，愈趨愈甚；那時文人，旣沒有辭書可查，又沒有類書可翻，大半依憑記憶，記憶力强的便以用事富麗爲世所重。記憶有時靠不住，「用事」就要錯誤了。顏之推家訓文章篇說；「後漢書囚」司徒崔烈以鋃鐺鏁。鋃鐺。大鏁也；世間爲誤作金銀字，武烈太子亦是數千卷學士，嘗作詩云；「銀鏁三公脚，那撞僕射頭」，爲俗所誤。這一類情形，很多很多。後人雖有類書，檢查的方法太不方便，又因舊文人泥古躱懶，不肯下切實工夫，古人用錯了，便相沿成誤。如顏之推辨「」孔懷代「兄弟」之誤。其明甚理，舊文人還是「友于」，「孔懷」依舊沿不絶，「而立」，「不惑」，之類，還是有增無已。又如韓退之送孟東野序；「物不得其平則鳴」。而其下文則云；「在唐虞時，晷陶禹，其善鳴者而假之以」鳴；夔假於韶以鳴；伊妖鳴殷，周公鳴周。又云；「天將和其聲而使鳴國家之盛。」明明前後自相矛盾，不成理論，宋洪容齋已知其誤。但舊文人用這句不通的「凡物不得其平則鳴」，我見過的已不知有多少次。</p>
<h3 id="c231">潮汕道上 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>又一度過潮汕道上。</p>
<p>人一從别國來，對於潮汕道　上短短一段路程的幣制便　會把頭腦攪得發昏。在汕頭時才把外幣換成「汕紙」，一臨到要趁車，月友便警告着那又需換成另一種貨幣，因爲汕頭銀行家的鈔票在内地是不受信仰的。買車票和購物時，一陣銀錢的支出和找入，使我這久旅異地的離鄉客不覺因麻煩而咒駡起來。待坐上了火車，這古老的車輛底顚簸。直像輪船遇着了風浪一樣，使人滿身不舒服，呵，遠别多年的潮汕，你這些留給歸來的浪子的東西，竟然和「古昔」一樣。</p>
<p>然而一從玻璃窗上望向外面去，潮汕道　上的面貌却顯然有點變遷。雖然在秋的田野上農人們還有裸着上身耕作的，而在那古老的鄉村的大榕樹底下，黯黑的池畔，農婦們的洗衣濯米如舊，但是在那鄉道的邊上，高大的碉堡却是建立起來了。</p>
<p>「如今，匪徒是不敢向鄉村侵來了。」一個剛才歸國的老華僑指着堡樓浮起了歡笑。</p>
<p>「不，現在的鄉民竟多的當起匪來了！」一個誠懇的老鄉民接着個長長的嘆氣。</p>
<p>他們的談話中止了。二個護路的軍士從我們的車廂裏通過。</p>
<p>把眼睛重轉向車子外面。在被車子顚簸得有點眼花的視綫之下，桑浦山的黑石還是炎炎地發光着，而柑園裏的柑子是紅紅地成熟了。</p>
<p>看着桑浦山的綿延的山脈，和牠粗獷的面貌如故，想來潮汕是應該維持其原有的冷酷的尊嚴吧？</p>
<p>「想來柑子是不會在天津和上海的不景氣下而至銷路停滯吧？」我默默地向廣大的原野禱祝着。</p>
<p>同時，一個衣服襤褸而面貌憔悴的農夫在柑園的小泥路上出現，他却留給我一個潮汕道上最後的視綫所得來的深刻的現象了</p>

<p>她們大家迷惘地伸開了手，他找那扇大門，可是即使當他在走開去的時候，他仍不免碰到了那個壯健尼姑黑色眼珠的尾光，帶了牠的永世䀹瞬閃動着，那微笑重又跑到他的臉上來了。同時，他的心在暗想，他眞願他會握住她的這兩隻像是一對配偶的小鳥，動情地袖着的微黑的乳白色的手呢。</p>
<p>他想竭力把思念回到他自己的缺點上來，罪在我！他對自己怒喝着。可是即使當他怒喝這句話的時候，他仍覺到有什麽東西，在他肋骨旁邊觸癢着，對他說；笑啊！</p>
<p>這三個女人，留在這間高大的房間裏，相互的瞧着，她們把手舉起了一會，像是六隻小鳥突然飛出了樹葉似的，然後重又放了下來。</p>
<p>「可憐的人兒」·這個修道院長同情地說。</p>
<p>「眞的。眞的。可憐的人兒　。」這個年靑的尼姑，用種天眞的，銳聲的情感呌。</p>

<p>這個修道院長不聲不響的移近牀邊，把頭俯近死屍的臉孔上面。</p>
<p>「她彷彿曉得呢，可憐的人兒，」她喃喃的說。「你們不這樣想嗎？」</p>
<p>這三個戴白頭巾的頭，靠在一起。她們第一次看到奧斐麗亞的嘴角，有一淺淺的滑稽的皺紋。她們帶種興奮的奇怪看着。</p>
<p>「她已經看到他的了。」那個年靑的恐怖的尼姑說。</p>
<p>這個尼修道院長，用種優美的姿勢，把那塊綉得很精緻的面布，仍放到這冰冷的臉孔上去；她們捻着念珠，給這個亡塊喃喃的讀了一個祈告。然後修道院長放兩支蠟燭到燭臺的燭籤上去，用那有力的可是柔軟的手握，把那蠟燭挿牢了。</p>
<p>這個臉色微黑的，壯健的尼姑，重又握了她的小本聖經坐下了。其餘的兩個，輕輕的綷　的移到門口去，走進　了白色的廣大的長廊。那兒輕柔地，毫無聲息地飄動着許多條暗色的簾帷。像是一條江河裏的許多隻黑色的天鵝。她們突然跬躇了。她們看到了一個寂寞的男人身影，披了一件憂鬱的外套，在這㢠廊盡頭的陰冷地方乔徊着。修道　院長突然加快了脚步。</p>
<p>馬太看見她們向他走來，這幾個鑲上了框子一般的臉孔，和沒了手的肥大身影，這個年靑的尼姑，離後一些跟着。</p>
<p>「原諒我，我的媽媽，」他說，彷彿他是在街上一般，「我把我的帽子掉在什麽地方了············」</p>

<h3 id="c233">薩爾投票 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 無法</p>
<p>薩爾本爲德國土地，自歐戰後劃歸國際管理，十三日爲薩爾公民自由投票决定之期，票上載明三種辦法，（一）歸還德國，（二）歸併法國，（三）維持現狀，選民當在所擇定辦法之旁，劃一十字。此種自由决定投票，與尋常投票選舉不同，因關於國土的運命，與歐局的前途，其意義非常重大也。</p>
<p>因爲薩爾素爲德國屬地，故居民亦以德國爲多，雖德國之中，亦有反希特勒派，與敎會中一部份的反對，然觀於國这黨佈置的嚴密，和精神的奮發，其結果自有勝利的可能，假定此次投票結果，而對於歐局將來發生若何之嚴重影響，茲可不必加以深切的推論，惟在此投票之中，有一事足城注意的，卽一般國民對於國家的權利，一些不肯輕易放過是也　。</p>
<p>據十三日路透社薩爾白魯根電，德國前總理巴本，淸晨偕其夫人及二女，　到此投票，在人羣中等候十分鐘之久，今日最後抵此者爲一婦人，伊從上海出發，路經西伯利亞，在火車中十六天，今晨始抵柏林，特僱飛機趕來投票，其時全城飛雪，而亂事謠言，亦散段天空，而該婦人竟不顧一切，前往投票，试思此種投票，有何等的重要意義。</p>
<p>巴本曾爲德國總理，故對於薩爾誰屬問題、天然有深切的關係、親自率領夫人小姐，前往投票，尙猶可說，而某一婦人，特地由上海出發，於大雪中特僱飛機，前往投票，却是難能可貴，并且電文中僅謂某一婦人，而並不詳其性氏地位，則該一婦人並不是有特别優越身份的人，可以想見，但其不憚萬里長途，不顧一切損失，趕往投票，則其視投票爲何等重要的一件事，再明白言之，卽是薩爾谁屬問題，視爲何等重大的一件事。</p>
<p>假定此事而在我國者，我人民對於此次的投票，當作若何的感想，無論行數萬里而來投一票的，是萬萬做不到，卽使近在咫尺的人，在此風雪交加之中，亦恐要放棄投票權，以爲已有許多人投票，不在乎我的區區一票也　。所以去投可不投亦可，我國人少國家民族觀念，苟非與自身切已有關，决不輕易費一舉手之勞，往往如此。</p>
<p>我說並非無據，卽就從前選舉省會議員，國會議員情形觀之，已可見見選民的投票權，大抵放棄，均被一般少數辦理選舉者所包辦，自己的票，已入匭中，而選舉何人，尙未知曉。今觀德國人民對於公民投票權利。如此熱烈認眞，宜乎歐戰後幾亡之德國，不二十年而有復興之象也。</p>
<h3 id="c234">大一歲 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 不揚</p>
<p>翻完了一本寸半厚的日曆，逃過了一座銀砌的年關，於是人們年齡的標價上，就大上一歲。</p>
<p>蹣跚的六十歲的祖父大上一歲。</p>
<p>無知的六歲的孫兒也大上一歲。</p>
<p>是元旦的前夜，上了年紀的兼做慈母的祖父從紫褐色的竹箱裏找到一件他兒子上學穿的藍布棉袍子，於是珍貴地把它捧出來，在螢燄似的燭光下仔細地端詳着；雖只大襟上有幾塊墨蹟，雖只領；圈和袖口有些霉氣，却並沒破；就是小襟裏的幾個蛀洞是不會被人家發覺的。</p>
<p>於是新年裏就可以見到，向穿着破爛短打的孫兒像承繼他父親職位似的穿起昨夜祖父替他預備好的棉袍子來。雖只别人輕蔑他的態度並沒變，可是在兼做慈母的祖父的心裏，却已經想盡所有的辦法了。</p>
<p>「阿爺，您着長短正好哩。」指着比從前多半截的棉袍子孫兒很滿足地問。</p>
<p>祖父的臉微皺着，像在笑又像不是。「您比舊年長許多了。」</p>
<p>「您看，再過幾年好和您一樣長了。」</p>
<p>提起一隻給寒冷染紅的手剛觸着祖父生滿着鬍鬚的下巴。</p>
<p>快和自己一樣長了。一陣歡喜爬上　祖父的心頭，他伸出一隻纒滿着靑筋的手慈祥地覆在小小的光頭上，他是多麽心急地希望孫兒長大起來呀。倘然可能的話，他眞想把自己大的一歲也加到他身上去。</p>
<p>立時，他感覺到自己是六十二歲的人了，大一歲，不是和死亡更接近一步嗎？</p>
<p>眼前的歐喜霎那間就給未來的憂慮擠到天外，一隻手不自覺地從光頭上滑下來。</p>
<p>孫兒莫名其妙的望望乾癟辣茄似的祖父的臉，怪沒趣地蹩轉屁股走了。</p>
<p>「倘然自己現在死了的話，無疑的，他將變做一個流浪在街頭的野孩了，恁着人們欺負，恁着風霜壓迫。」感傷地望着孫兒的後影他這末想。</p>
<p>他開始詛咒歲朋催老了他　。</p>
<p>可是他不能不歡凶迎歲朋把他的孫兒加長起來。就是從前他也有幾次歡迎過它；那是自己快討老婆的當兒，他眞希望歲月加倍的逝去一好把他的「好日」拉攏來；還有，就是生了兒子以後。倘然兒子在着的話，今年應該是三十歲了。那他是一些不會記錯的，他肖馬。還是自己最得發一年生的。爲着一世吃了許多不識字的虧，就决心把省下來的錢送兒子去上學。從那天起，他家裏多了一個穿長衣的學生。十四歲那年，就託個遠房的親戚薦他到一家鎭頭上的當店做學徒，還替他討了一房好媳婦。可是不幸在孫兒的出世不久，媳　婦就生產褥症死了。接着兒子也在一個時疫盛行的夏天斷了命。祖孫倆就這末孤單單　地過活到現在。</p>
<p>現在他一面繼續出賣着殘餘的勞力。一面用希望兒子長大的心理襲用到孫兒身上去。</p>
<p>可是年老了，勞作的報酬也沒像壯　年時候多，他不能再培植自己的孫兒進學校，就是穿一件長衣都還是兒子遺留下來的。</p>
<p>在他的希望裏，孫兒已經會利用嘴巴講話，利用腿膀走路了，不算短的七年的歲月，把孫兒加長到自己的腰部了，同時自己的額上也多添了幾條生活的鞭痕。</p>
<p>大一歲了，兩種不同的思潮在上了年紀的兼做慈母的祖父腦海裏澎湃着。</p>
<h3 id="c235">兎子 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 企吾</p>
<p>星期日，帶了孩子到城隍廟去，在賣鳥地方，看見了一雙兎子，就吵着買了回來。</p>
<p>我本來喜歡小動物的，在鄉下時候，我每天光陰都消磨在自己的嗜好上。鄉下有寬大的園地，廣闊的座院，種種花卉之外，豢豢小動物是再好沒有的了。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>狗與貓，幾乎每人家都有，這兩種在鄉下不能視爲豢養的動物，他們已參加這家庭的集團，所以往往在搬家的小車上，發見高踞車脊，顧盼自豪的貓狗是很平常的事。</p>
<p>自然，我的家庭中也少不了牠們的。</p>
<p>一隻狗是雜種的，記不起牠的籍貫了，能够同普通狗一樣守家，也能够帮我出去打獵。牠已是鄉下最好的狗了，許多狗集會的時候，牠總是首領，有時吵架起來，往往狗主人閙到我門上來。</p>
<p>說到貓，是很可愛的一隻，不偷食，勤捕鼠。我讀書寫字的時候。在我燃好了一爐香，她像符咒一樣靈騐，不必我呼喚，彷彿一尊彌勒佛似的蹲在案頭，注視着我，不喚她去她無論如何不會跳下來。</p>
<p>某次，我的朋友到鄉下來，我告訴他這戲法，他不信，捕捉她的時候，被她抓破幾處，然而終究沒有捉下來。</p>
<p>閑話少說，我想寫的是我在鄉下養兎子的經過。鄉下人對於兎子特别寳貴，非親戚至好，他們不肯分贈的，所以我得來十對兎子眞是個很好的機會。</p>
<p>是我的房客，他們因爲在南京找到了事情，闔家遷移，許多笨重的破傢具都分贈了隣人，而十對兎子，爲了十數年賓主的關係，我享了優先權。</p>
<p>在後園築好了小屋，採了許多菜葉供給她們、困難的問題却發生了。兎子是最膽小的動物，據說她見了鮮血，要顫慄得死去的。我家這只貓，我還可以禁止她闖到後園去，但是那條牠知道我們打死了的野鴨拖回來的雜種狼狗，不要說牠放肆去嚼一個飽，祇要牠這毛茸茸的怪臉到後園裏闖一通，十對兎子就是十二個屍身了。</p>
<p>依媽的主意，把那條狗送了，我却有些不願失去這個打獵時的伴侶，沒有聽媽的話，用一根鍊子鎖住了，而且特别叮咐家人謹防牠發野。</p>
<p>最初二個月是相安無事，但某一次打獵回來，我買了幾個牛肉包子給牠吃，忘了立刻把牠鎖好，三分鐘内，被牠嚼去了二隻兎子。</p>
<p>那種血肉狼藉的情形，使我覺得對另外的八對十分抱歉。媽更是愛物如子的，她恨恨地把那狗打了一頓，令我家的長工帶牠到十里外的姑丈家去。</p>
<p>如此平靜無事。小兎子也生下來了，一個後園除了幾株菓樹之外，都是她們的世界。白的身體。紅的眼珠，在靑翠的草地間跳躍，弟弟時常跟她們玩得遍身汚泥的。</p>
<p>如今離開家鄉已三年，雖然弟弟寫信來總提上一大堆兎子的話。他告訴我那只貓我出門後，也闖過一次禍，被媽放到後村去了。</p>
<p>現在寸　地的上海，這一對從城隍廟買來的兎子簡直沒有地方供她們遊戲，而外來的侵略更是隨時隨地可以發生，於沒辦法之中連籠子養在臥室裏，看她們的生命不知能够維持到什麽時候。</p>
<h3 id="c236">小客棧裏的夜 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 若望</p>
<p>夜深了，辛苦的旅人啊，息一息吧</p>
<p>在雪地，拖着一雙濕透了的笨得的脚　。一個漆黑的身影踏進一家沒有人注意的小客棧了。店小二看着有客來，提起了嗓子呌；</p>
<p>「有客，」</p>
<p>關於這一種帶有歡迎意味的呌聲該是高興的，但是我却愁眉不展地看着一間一間的小房門，</p>
<p>「先生，這一間够小了吧。」</p>
<p>「還要小一點的有嗎，」</p>
<p>在小客棧裏最小的一間房間裏住下了，電燈光是跟隔壁那間房間合用了一盞，很是微北，可是床帳的骯髒仍舊可以辨得出的。我看見墊褥上那大塊的水迹，心裏便下意識地覺得這墊褥的經騐之豐富了。</p>
<p>睡在床上了，下邊是沒有温冷的草，上邊的被窩也起着疙瘩了，蓋在身上覺得這被窩是石子做的，翻了幾個身也找不到一處地方有着較多的温意。</p>
<p>小客棧裏是很靜，店小二呌着的「有客」就如在耳朶邊，在樓梯上跑路的脚步聲都像震撼着我的臥床，心裏不由得煩怨起來。一件一件不如意的事情都　在眼前閃過一那嚴峻的老闆的臉，房主人的無情······失業的人好比是高而夫球盤裏的鐵球，怨着，煩着，恨着，咒駡着，戰慄着······</p>
<h3 id="c237">聚餐會　龍血 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>忽然隔壁的房裏走進一個人來了，獨自個兒在翻動着牆壁上的紙頭，閒靜地吹着中哨，不一會，一個賣小書的人走進隔壁的房了，我第一次聽得那隔壁男人的聲音，高傲地說「看膩啦，這些鳥書！」</p>
<p>「買一本消消閒，先生，春宮照片也是有的。」</p>
<p>「勿要勿要，男人說；」</p>
<p>片刻地寗靜了。</p>
<p>「客人阿要買瓜子吃，五香瓜子哪。」一個買瓜子的女人呌着便走進隔壁的房間了，男人沒有響。</p>
<p>「揸點吃一吃吧，一個人住子太冷靜啊，」</p>
<p>「别揸，我不會吃這玩意兒。」</p>
<p>「你不會吃，我剝給你吃。」</p>
<p>又片刻地寗靜了。</p>
<p>忽然，那賣瓜子的女人冲塞地呌了。</p>
<p>「那不行啊，我家裏有男人的，勿」要動手脚，一語音是帶着一點微顫，也帶着一點憤怒。</p>
<p>拍一打人的聲音。</p>
<p>「不要假正經了，坐在這上談談，外邊很冷的。」男人；</p>
<p>「談什麽。要買就買，勿買就拉倒」。女人；</p>
<p>「什麽人等你格；這樣心急法，銅鈿總是要給的，不過你得在這裏坐一坐。」</p>
<p>他們是沒有知道隔壁住着一個我，這樣地放肆！</p>
<p>「勿要給别人看見，難爲情來。」女的說；顯然兩方的意見是接近了。</p>
<p>接着隔壁的房門「碰」的掩上了。</p>
<p>想不到巴比塞的「地獄」就在此複演了，我穿上了濕透了的褲子，趕要換了一個房間，換着的是較大的一間了，在最後最靠邊的一間，這樣跟他們隔遠了，四圍又復是一片的寗靜，瓦蓋上化雪的滴水聲都可以聽聞。</p>
<p>但是被窩依然很冷，聽着時鐘一聲聲的打着，緊閉着眼睛都睡不着，於是心上又浮起怨憤，煩悵，咒駡······</p>
<p>將睡着的時候，門上又有人輕輕地打着了。</p>
<p>「誰！」</p>
<p>「客人阿買瓜子呢。」是一個女人的聲音。我回答都不給他一個，把頭兜在臭被窩裏了。</p>
<p>那時我又想起了巴比塞「地獄」，想起了所謂「人。」</p>

<h3 id="c242">好萊塢星相家達理斯對於一九三五年之預言（上） <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>好萊塢明星們的星相家，達理歐斯，（Ｄａｒｅｏｓ），現在又一年一度的發佈他的預言了。</p>
<p>好萊塢的人，在過去四年之中，已經知道他的預言是「非常準確」的。他曾預先指示婚姻，子女，死亡，離異等等朕兆，他亦曾預先宣佈過各大明星，在事業上，或私人生活上，種種休戚升沉之事據說他的預言，後來都一一議實了。我們並不是提倡迷信，但是好萊塢的許多明星們，雖然他們比我普通的中國人迷信並不深到那裏去，却都已深深信仰這位大預言家達理歐斯了。我記得申報的影刋，從前亦登載關於達理歐斯預言的事蹟。現在爲讀者一些興趣起見，再將他對於今年的預言，再叙述一下。</p>
<p>據說，好萊塢有許多製片商人，他們在做一件重要企圖之先，一定要先去和達理歐斯商量一下，才决定他們的進止。那裏還有許多明星一一男女都有一一他們是常常按期到達理歐斯家理去的。他們在達理歐斯的家裏，是「家屬的一份子」。因此，達理歐斯對於他們的一切，他們的希望，他們的計劃，他們的夢想，以及他們的秘寗，都已沿鑒無遺了。達理歐斯利用了這種深切的了解，再加星象上所顯示的，以及水晶球上所表現的，他就可以判决他們未來的休咎。當然這裏面亦有許多江湖訣，但是至少比較我們的瞎子先生，排八字，算流年，來得近乎理解些。</p>
<p>在去年，一九三四年的開始，他就宣佈過好萊塢影界一切未來的大事。他所宣佈的，一共有六十一條之多，共中居然有四十七條，證實了，祇有兩條錯的，其餘十二條到現在還沒有結果，不知道準確不準確。譬方說，達理歐斯預示一九三四年，有兩個女明星，一白一黑，將和她們的丈夫離婚。結果，那白女郎是琪恩哈羅，黑女郎是凱茀蘭茜絲，都和她們的丈夫離婚了。達理斯又說，一九三四年，將有三個可愛的明星死了。結果曼麗特蘭漱，麗琳泰許曼，和劉可迪三個人都相繼死亡了。他并且曾預示過麗琳泰許曼將遇不測奇禍，而她確是汽車出事死的。凡達理斯所說的一切，據好萊塢電影雜誌的統計，竟有百分之七十是凖確的三分是錯的，其餘二十分無結果。</p>
<p>現在，這位星相家又來預言本年的一切影界大事了。我們即使不信，亦可以姑妄聽之罷了。他對於本年的預言是；</p>
<p>在一九三五年中，將有三位可愛的大明星，遇到慘劇而喪失生命。</p>
<p>英國及「廣播電影」（Ｔｅｌｅｖｉｉｏｎ）將在本年之中，使好萊塢感受到强烈的競爭。「廣播電影」在本年之内，將有猛速的進步，并將侵入電影事業。英國影片事業，亦將無限制地上昇，使好萊塢感覺到極度的不安。再則，許多美國的電影明星，亦將脫離了好萊塢，歸順於英倫去。</p>
<p>茂娜洛意（Ｍｙｒｎａｌｏｙ）將成爲一九三五年的紅星。瓊克勞馥（Ｊｏａｎｃｒａｗｌｏｒ）將於本年内　結婚。珍娓蓋諾（Ｊａｎｅｔｇａｙｎｏｒ）亦將再嫁。卡路兒郎白（Ｃａｒｏｌｅｌｏｍｂａｒｄ）亦然。葛萊泰嘉寳（Ｇｒｏｔａｇａｒｂｏ），因爲母親病重的緣故，將回瑞典去，不久她的母親就死了。她自己的體康此後亦就受了極大的影響。她雖然將脫米高梅，而單獨設立公司攝製影片，但是她昔日的榮名，亦日就衰歇而永遠不可恢復了。嘉寳在本年之中，是沒有愛情和婚姻的糾紛的。</p>
<p>約翰巴里摩亞家庭，今年將遭遇不測，并將受盜竊。據星角上的顯示，約翰巴里摩亞，本年將得奇災，或在其私人遊艇之上，或在汽車輪轂之下。約翰巴里摩亞。將有鉅大的英國影片裂成。他的家庭生活，仍舊是和樂無聞的。</p>
<p>里昂巴里摩亞之妻，今年將得重病，幾瀕於危。里昂自己的體康，亦將一蹶不振，或將得癱瘓之症。（未完）</p>

<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Ｇａｍｂｌｉｎｇ一國泰映一</p>
<p>賭博，酗酒，爭風，吃醋，謀殺，控訴，自殺，狂歡，一大串聲色淫樂，刧奪鬥殺等罪惡的案件，常在靡爛頽唐的社會中，走馬燈似的串演着。同時也無批判無揚棄地，被大部份製片商們反映到銀幕上來，給一般旁觀者，甚至是親自或多或少地參與着的人們作爲刺激與享受的娛樂。</p>
<p>「情奔疑案」就是在這樣的態度上，用這樣的材料，所製成的這類片子。</p>
<p>以紐約賭塲主人竇柏養女的情殺案爲中心，串聯着一羣無所事事的「漂亮人們」的享樂與墮落的生活。淺薄，空泛，與庸俗，從開始到結局，從結搆到演出。</p>
<p>“Ｇａｍｂｌｉｎｇ”在美國據說是以Ｇｅｏｆ３</p>
<p>ｇｅｍ·ｇａｍｂｌｉｎｇ主演而成功，同時他也因爲演它而成名的舞台劇本。可是通過了攝影機的鷹眼，在銀幕上顯映出的這「情奔疑案」，顯然是够高明。自然，舞台藝術與電影藝術是有着若干不同的。</p>
<p>導演Ｒｏｗｌａｎｄｖ·ｌｅｅ用沉滯的調子來處理全片是一個大失敗的地方。個别地雖然有着若干畫面，對話，空氣等的頗爲優美之處，可是也不能單獨地有它份外的效果。至於因謀殺案中的犧牲者維娜之死的寫得太模糊，减輕了全劇發展上之嚴重的情緖與空氣，以及用不必要的穿挿來混淡個性的與心理的描寫等地方，尤使全片的嚴理損失。</p>
<p>兩個女角的個性與體態的Ｃａｓｔｉｎｇ頗好，演梅綺的Ｗｙｎｎｅｇｉｂｓｏｎ亦較佳。</p>

<p>— 周虺</p>
<p>毫無疑義的，這是一部把握住現實的作品，雖然有不少的地方，作者丢開現實，而偏重於理想一方面。然而，無論如何，那樣優秀的作風，充滿着熱情，激昻，壯烈，以及反帝運動的情緖，我們都値得讚美的。</p>
<p>導演在這片裏，可以說是極成功的，如六個路工給土豪私刑鞭撻，金哥用脚趾剪割綁繩，預備脫逃時的緊張，和飯舖廟戲弄洪警鈴，令人發噱等。在上半部極不易討好的畫面裏，作者穿挿了不少噱頭，使整個的劇中空氣，一些不感到枯燥與沉悶，而感到的却是愉快，輕鬆。在這兒，我們不能不說孫瑜之匠心獨運了。</p>
<p>說到演員，作者對於每人的個性都是十二分的把握住了，金燄的潇洒，張翼的沉默果敢，意志直的粗界，黎莉莉的輕佻，發揮得淋漓盡致，尤其是「韓蘭根」的「噱」，是帮助了劇中沒有枯燥的收穫。</p>
<p>其他如畫面的美麗，偉大，輕快，攝影的淸晰，面那支雄壯的歌曲，也增加了劇中高潮不少。</p>

<p>— 素因</p>
<p>大家散了之後，傑弗雷，歇伯，和迭倫，三個人同坐一車。迭倫回到庽所之後，傑弗雷和歇伯，亦就各自回去了。迭倫到了庽所裏，在洗澡的時候，很歡樂的唱着歌。他自己想着，這是快樂的一天，而曼麗亦是再美麗沒有的女子了。當他洗完了澡，他的侍者莊者莊生給他毛巾的時候，他覺得前途是穩定沒有的了。他又想起了那天晚上，當他告訴她，他生平沒有愛過一個女人，像他現在愛曼麗一樣的時候，曼麗伸出一個纖纖的指頭，貼住了他的貼住了他的嘴道；迭倫，那個你不用說。不是還有一個康妮······你亦愛過她，同居六個月之久嗎？</p>
<p>迭倫道；（曼麗，那祗可以算年輕的時候所做的事，不算數的。什麽都要經過那一個階級的。康妮哩······鄧妮哩······蘇西哩·····吳茜呢······她們都不足數的。眞的，曼麗，她們不過是一種經歷，而你是眞愛情。）曼麗給這樣花言巧語一哄，亦就相信而無話可說了。</p>
<p>迭倫洗完了澡，很自在的嘴裏哼着一支探戈的舞樂，離開了澡房，跑到自己臥室裏，他喊着他的侍者道·（莊生。你又上那兒去了？我又不是和捉什麽迷藏，你爲什麽總要躱起來呢？）他一喊，外面立即有人打着門。他於是又像做戲似的喊着道；（莊生，請進！我和你說，我是世界上最快樂沒有的人了！等我的好日子過了，我就要替你亦找一個女人了！）</p>
<p>他正自言自語地說着，門開了，但是進來的，不是他的當差，而是一個女人，康妮巴尼司，仍舊是那副蓬鬆的頭髮，惺忪的眼睛，迷人的笑渦。迭倫先在鏡子裏看見了她。他起初不相信他自己的眼睛，他立即掉過身體來對着她。他一笑不客氣地，將她推出臥房，推到客廳裏去了。但是他好像受了催眠似的，仍舊跟在她後面，跟到了客廳裏。他兩隻眼睛看住了她，好像被一條響尾蛇迷住了似的。康妮一勁兒地向着他媚笑着。</p>
<p>她向迭倫走近了一步笑道；（怎麽啦？你的舌頭給貓吃掉了嗎？）迭倫不覺退後了一步道；（請你離開這個地方！你不能到這個地方來的！）康妮還是笑着，她那副迷人的眼睛，作着半張半闔，要睡覺的樣子。她裝着靡靡的聲音道；（哦，迭倫，我的心肝，我再也忍不下去了。我怎麽能離開你呢？我太傻了、放你走開。等你走了之後，我才知道我是深愛你的······</p>
<p>··我祇愛你一個人！）</p>
<p>迭倫道；「但是我明天就要結婚了！」他的聲音差不多是叫喊起來了。康娓，難道你還不知道嗎？」康妮張大了眼睛，裝作驚懼的神氣道；「迭倫！眞的嗎？那怎麽可以！······我不懂你說的什麽話！」她這樣嘮嘮叨叨吵嚷起來，她的聲音越說越高起來。最後她喊了起來道；「我來到這裏，我要告訴你，我多末恨你，討厭你，憎惡你，你這不要臉的東西！誰嫁給你的，她可以得到我的同情」！迭倫亦叫喊着道；「好了！你告訴我了！現在你滾出去吧！不然我看動手把你擲出去了！」他說着，掉轉頭來走進了臥房，將房門狠命地砰然一聲推上了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c249">近年來國貨建築材料之進展（下） <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 薛次莘</p>
<p>（五）鋼窗　建築物之用鋼窗，在我國原祗十餘年之歷史。當時所用者，悉屬外貨。近年銷路日增，國人始有設廠製造者。其鋼料固仍屬外貨，然裝配製造則悉出國人之手。價格亦較完全舶來品爲廉。然工作上之須改進者尙多，深望鋼窗製造廠家，今後對於工作方面，零件配製方面，多多改善，務求精良。行見國貨鋼窗之前途，正多光明也。</p>
<p>（六）門鎖　門鎖向用外貨，卽有國貨亦屬簡單者。近年始見中國製造之門鎖。外觀與舶來品同樣美觀，幾可亂眞。雖其中零件之一部，不得不取給外洋；苟能精益求精，亦未始不可奪其市塲。其他五金材料，國貨亦日見增加，材料亦均有可應用，不可謂非國貨建築材料中一有希望之工業也。</p>
<p>（七）釘　吾國原有之鐵釘，係手工製成，粗笨不適用於今之建築。於是所謂洋釘者，隨處鑡之。小至一釘之微，亦須仰仗外貨，亦可慨矣。所幸近年已有設廠製造國產釘者，雖其原料因鋼鐵業未興，仍須利用外國原料，然在國中製造，其出品堅挺圓整，堪以應用。苟於製造上繼續改進，始終不懈，產量逐漸加以擴充，起而奪獲洋釘之市塲，亦意中事也。</p>
<p>（八）結論　國貨建築材料，近年之進展如此而已。試思建築中之主要材料，如鋼鐵木材，有無國貨足以取代舶來品者乎。木材吾國固素有者也，然取材大者非洋松不可。花色之繁多，又非吾國木料所能及。國外木材，雖須經重洋運達吾國，然以其適合取材，較之國貨反爲經濟便利。因而外貨木材，幾無取代之一日。而回顧吾國於森林之培植，則初不爲政府所注意。運輸之困難，較之跋涉重洋爲尤甚。偌大漏巵，無復補救之策，其亦可慨也矣。至於鋼鐵，則更非依賴外貨不可。今之高樓傑閣，用鋼鐵建築則悉屬外貨。用鋼骨水泥，則鋼骨又悉屬外貨。雖鋼條三角鐵等國内亦曾一度製造，終以失敗而停鑄。深望今之謀國者，於建築上基本材料之鋼鐵木材，加以積極之經營。蓋其重要，豈特限於建築一隅；於國防民生，均有莫大之關係也。</p>
<p>國貨建築材料，近年固已有長足之進步。然仍未脫萌芽時代。將來之進展，更視乎國人之維護。嘗見日本歐美建築師工程師，雖在國外，於其說明書中輒指用其本國材料。豈其本國貨必優於外貨耶！良以國計民生之關係，不可不格外維護提倡耳。而吾國國貨，因在近年，始有相當進展，自不能達於完美程度。益以吾國建築師工程師多屬留學歐美之士，習見彼國之材料，於是於選料取材之時，對國貨則以其新進，輒取懷疑態度，對外貨以其習見，反覺可用，致未能盡提倡國貨之能事。是以今後國貨建築材料之能否進展，自不能不望於製造者本身之精益求精，尤不能不望於吾國建築師工程師之格外維護也。</p>

<p>一關於築塲裏用一</p>
<p>（收縮正誤一見本馡一Ｏ一期，木料遇燥易縮，受濕則漲，前說屬誤，合亟更正。）</p>
<p>陽角一（Ｅｘｔｅｒｉｏｒｃｏｎｎｅｒ）露外的牆身。角與角相接處。那就是陽角。在　房屋内的呌陰角（ｉｎｔｅｒｎａｌｃｏｎｎｅｒ）</p>
<p>木蟹一（ｆｌｏａｔｅｄ）這是跟老孵鷄一樣。並非是動物中的蟹。而是泥水匠在粉刷水泥時用的長方形的木塊。（約四五寸闊。七八寸長）（是磨擦水泥面使之光滑潔凈的器具。</p>
<p>靴脚一一（Ｓｈｅｏ）水落管子（Ｄａｗｎｐｉｐｅ）的下端和明溝（ｓｕｆａｃｅｄｒａｉｎ）相近的地方。突出像嘴似的東西。水從那裏漏出。這呌靴脚。</p>
<p>脚手一一建築房屋的塲地上。終是呈現着一種雜亂的情形。有時候地上給木料或磚塊之類的料作堆得不能行走。就在這地方擱起一塊二寸十二寸的洋松（Ｏｒｅｇｉｎｐｉｎｅ）板。以便交通。這就是脚　手。（Ｓｃａｆｆｏｌｄｉｎｇ）在普通建造樓房時搭成的竹架子。也呌脚手。</p>
<p>鐵馬一一（Ｆｌｏｏｒｃｌａｍｐ）木匠在鋪樓板時。（一種寸六寸或一寸四寸的企口板。）對於樓板。第一應該注意的就是樓板的疏鬆得發現細縫。這時就要用鐵馬使之排到緊密的地步。它的形式像注音字母的　字。用法將尖銳的兩端。敲在擱栅上。然後鋪上樓板。合攏企口。再用三角形的木凖逐漸排緊。</p>

<p>夫建築事業者。乃一切建設之中心體系也。不論衣食住行。皆與建築有直接或間接之關係在焉。是以欲知國之强弱。可以建設爲占。欲明建設之精疏。可以建築爲卜。蓋二十世紀。爲一物質文明之時代也。所謂物質文明者。端賴建築爲之維繫耳。舉凡如江河之濬治。須建築也。道途之開闢。須建築也。海港之建設須建築也。鐵路之敷置。須建築也。他如工廠建築。農塲建築。碼頭建築。橋樑建築。堆棧建築。機關房屋建築。企業發展建築。與夫其他種種事業亦莫不須建築是尙矣。不寗維此。至若農工商業之發達。文化之灌輸。交通之利便。更有賴於建築事業之開展。此建築事業所負之使命所以綦重而且大也。方今之世。建設爲先。吾國自亡淸以還。外侮侵陵。内亂頻仍。致建設幼稚。經濟枯竭。民生凋敝。國勢日削。迨國民革命軍底定全國。政府當局。鑒於建設之重要。提倡不遺餘力。新聞界。亦灼見建設關係之鉅。多方宣傳。而吾建築界。更深知自身所繫使命之重。尙能克盡厥職。如此上下相維。行見吾國一切建設。日臻繁勞。而吾建築事業。亦將蓬勃以興也。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Military news states that Xu Yuanquan's division is pursuing and suppressing bandits from Pengshui, and Wang Dongyuan's division is crossing the Wujiang River from Youxiu. The Xue division is detouring around Ziyang and exiting at Zunyi. Thirty regiments of Sichuan troops are deploying defenses around Qijiang, forming a large encirclement. The Nanchang headquarters has dispatched personnel to Changde and Yichang to survey and select office locations. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesperson for the staff delegation stated that the delegation would not judge the past merits or faults of the Sichuan armies, but would treat them equally in the future, giving them a chance to reform themselves. All members of the delegation have friendly relations with all aspects of the Sichuan army, but official matters will be handled impartially, and they will only act according to the orders of the central government. In order to consult on the situation of each army and to facilitate military liaison, it has been decided to order each army to send a senior staff officer to reside and work at the headquarters. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 14th)</p>

The 20th Army has appointed Liu Youfu, the chief secretary of the military party department, as the military liaison officer to reside and work at the headquarters. Yang is scheduled to return to Shunqing to defend his position in two or three days. Li Jiayu stated that the failure of the Sichuan army's past bandit suppression efforts was due to mutual suspicion among the various units. Now that the staff delegation has come to Sichuan on the orders of the central government to command, it will naturally be more effective. The key to suppressing bandits in northern Sichuan is encirclement, which is being implemented by various units with strict defenses. Furthermore, Deng Xihou must hand over the defense of Guang before he can fly to Chongqing. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed National Government Committee member Ma Chao-chun and over eighty members of the Fourth Legislative Committee, including Jiao Yitang, took their oaths of office at the National Government Hall on the morning of the 14th after the National Government Memorial Week. The Central Supervisor Ye Chucang, National Government Chairman Lin Sen, National Government Committee member Ma Chao-chun, and all the Legislative Committee members took office in order, led by Chairman Lin, and conducted the ceremony according to etiquette, followed by the oath-taking.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Ye Chucang delivered instructions, briefly stating that the Central Committee members were very pleased with the oath-taking ceremony of Committee member Ma and the Fourth Legislative Committee members today. Committee member Ma has worked hard in the revolution and has a glorious history, so the Central Committee has specially appointed him as a Government Committee member to assist in managing national affairs and stabilizing the central government. He also hoped that the Legislative Committee members, most of whom were re-elected from the previous session, would build upon their past efforts and complete the legal codes needed by the country and the people, etc. Chairman Lin then delivered instructions, briefly stating that Committee member Ma's past revolutionary history was well-known to the Central Committee members and did not need to be repeated. The Central Committee was very pleased to appoint him as a National Government Committee member, as it would greatly help with national affairs from now on. As for the Legislative Committee members who were re-elected, they all had considerable merits, and the newly appointed members were all academic experts, who would certainly be able to uphold the Central Committee's intentions and complete the perfect rule of law in the country. Afterwards, Ma Chao-chun and the representatives of all the Legislative Committee members expressed their gratitude, and accepted the instructions from the Central Supervisor and Chairman.

<p>Wang's Trip Abroad Postponed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke and Wang Chonghui arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 14th. After getting off the train, they went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Village to rest. Wang stated that he came to visit President Wang to continue discussing unity among all parties and to wait to meet with Chairman Chiang. He will stay in Nanjing for about three or four days and then return to Shanghai. Wang also stated that Mr. Hu's opinions were largely the same as the telegrams from Presidents Wang and Chiang. It is not yet known for sure whether Hu will go north to Shanghai or come to Nanjing. It is also not known whether he will go abroad. However, Hu only seeks to have his personal opinions adopted by the central government, and has never considered his personal position, so he can go north at any time. It depends on whether it is necessary for him to go to Hong Kong in the future. There is no motivation to move yet. Minister Kong has the intention to go south, but the date of his departure is not yet known. The reason why I have postponed my trip abroad, which was originally scheduled for the 15th, is because the International Court of Justice is currently only handling administrative matters and there are no lawsuits, and because the court must open on the first of next month, and there is not enough time. I have already sent a telegram to notify them that I will leave the country at the beginning of next month. Sun stated that he has had very little private contact with Mr. Hu recently, so he does not know for sure when Hu will go north. He also does not know about Hu's trip abroad. However, he has heard that Hu and the central government have gradually made progress in exchanging views since they began discussing national affairs together. Liu Luyin's arrival in Shanghai was a personal action and did not represent Hu, so there was no contact. Li Xiaosheng is Hu's secretary and must come north every year. This time, his arrival in Shanghai was indeed to convey Hu's opinions, and he has already returned to Hong Kong. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain reporter went to visit President Wang at the Minister of Railways' official residence No. 1 on the afternoon of the 14th.

<p>(Nanjing) Xiong Shihui visited Presidents Wang and Sun on the morning of the 14th to report on the political situation in Gan Province. According to him, in addition to waiting to visit Chairman Chiang to report on the conclusion of the Gan Xingying, he also plans to visit the central authorities to discuss the financial problems of Gan Province and request subsidies. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang received Xiong Shihui at 10:00 a.m. on the 14th, and Xiong reported in detail on the political affairs of Gan Province. He said that he would wait in Nanjing to visit Chairman Chiang and report on the conclusion of the Xingying before returning to Gan. According to him, this year Gan Province will pay attention to building water conservancy projects, opening up waterways, planting forests extensively, and restoring the old prosperity of the countryside. However, Gan Province has suffered from the ravages of the Red bandits for a long time, and the people are poor and the finances are exhausted. The social construction of the past has been destroyed. Temples and foot-bound women and men with queues from the old society can still be seen everywhere. Fortunately, the New Life Movement is being implemented, and the people are polite, pay attention to hygiene, and obey public order. Furthermore, the harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies in Gan Province have mostly been abolished, and the central government's subsidies are about to be suspended, resulting in no funds for the province's security forces. He has come to Nanjing this time to take the opportunity to ask the central government to find a way to provide relief, etc. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 14th)</p>

Ju Zheng presided over the meeting, and Jiao Yitang reported on "Self-Defense and Autonomy," briefly stating that the Premier once said that the people should be equipped with three essential elements: protection, maintenance, and education. Protection means self-defense, and maintenance means autonomy. Regarding self-defense, there have been systems in place throughout history, and the most complete Baojia Law was created by Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty. Currently, it is necessary to promote the Baojia system to increase self-defense capabilities. Furthermore, autonomy should implement all the regulations of the County and City Autonomy Law and the examinations for candidates. If protection and maintenance are complete, then we can talk about education, so that all people can receive general education and become sound citizens. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. after the report. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Niu Yongjian reported on the important work of the Examination Yuan over the past year at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 14th. The main points of his speech were: (1) Regarding examinations, five examinations have been held successively, with a total of 2,693 candidates taking the examinations and 348 people being admitted, all of whom have been assigned to various agencies for employment. (2) Regarding qualification reviews, there are two important measures: (a) the implementation of the review of civil service appointments; (b) the holding of the review of civil service registrations. In addition, various important laws and regulations have been drafted and promulgated, including the Civil Service Pension Regulations, the Civil Service Registration Regulations, the Regulations for the Assignment of Those Who Passed the General Examination, the Examination Regulations for Construction Personnel in the Higher Examination, the Examination Regulations for Auditing Personnel in the General Examination, and the National Examination and Qualification Review Conference Regulations, totaling nine types. The convocation of the National Examination and Qualification Review Conference in November of last year brought together representatives from central and local agencies and various universities to discuss and decide on unresolved issues in the two policies of examination and qualification review, and cases that needed to be handled flexibly due to special circumstances in various localities. The general direction will be to implement these guidelines one by one in the future, and the promotion of the two policies of examination and qualification review will naturally become smoother day by day. As for how the examination methods for appointed personnel should be completed, how to leniently admit candidates from provinces with fewer educated people, how to formulate examination methods for specialized technical personnel, how to link school graduation examinations with national personnel examinations, and how to lower the qualification requirements for personnel in remote provinces and regions, etc., etc., all of these should be carefully studied in the next few months, referring to the resolutions of the Examination and Qualification Review Conference, and the current examination and qualification review laws and regulations should be reorganized and revised in order to achieve implementation. The higher examination that should be held this year will also be held on schedule after the laws and regulations have been reorganized. This is the plan that should be worked hard on this year.

<p>Awaiting Resolution at a Provisional Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>The Banking District Was Once Tense</p>
<p>(Xiamen) After the Xiamen Commercial Bank suspended payments on the 12th, the board of directors decided to announce on the morning of the 14th that it would suspend business for fifteen days starting on the 14th, awaiting resolution at a provisional shareholders' meeting on the 30th. Deputy Manager Liu Yunsong stated that the bank owes depositors more than two million yuan, and its assets are sufficient to cover this amount. Lawyers and accountants have been hired to audit the accounts and submit a report to the meeting. As a result, on the morning of the 14th, the banknotes and deposits of five banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China &amp; South Sea Bank, the Commercial Bank of China, and the Industrial Bank of China, were simultaneously subject to runs and withdrawals. The banking district in the Haihou and Gangzaihou areas suddenly became tense. The Commercial Bank of China and other banks extended their business hours in the afternoon, and the situation gradually calmed down in the evening. The runs on the banks were caused by the collapse of the three major Qianzhuang of Jianyuan from the 6th to the 12th, and the subsequent suspension of business by the Xiamen Commercial Bank, which shook people's confidence. However, the banks are financially strong and trustworthy. On the 14th, the Chamber of Commerce invited the county government, the Xiamen Public Safety Bureau, various banks, and various trade associations to hold an emergency joint meeting for relief. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The tide of runs and withdrawals on various banks subsided in the evening of the 14th. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications experienced very few withdrawals. On the 14th, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting and decided to send a letter to the Public Safety Bureau to announce that all banks are fully prepared and that banknotes are universally accepted, so people should not disturb themselves.

<p>(Nanjing) The proposal by Wang Zhaoming and other members of the Central Political Council to raise funds to build a poor people's housing area in the capital originally estimated a total budget of 2.8 million yuan, to be raised over seven years. Each year, the Nanjing Municipal Government would be responsible for 250,000 yuan, the National Treasury would be responsible for 250,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan would be raised through donations. The first phase of the fundraising would be undertaken by the proponents, and the subsequent six phases would be undertaken by public and private agencies and organizations on an annual basis. The council believes that poor people's housing is urgently needed, and the financial resources of the municipal government are insufficient, so the National Treasury should provide a subsidy as appropriate. However, the amount of donations is huge, spanning six years, and whether it is a public agency, an organization, or a private organization, it seems difficult to maintain the burden for a long time. In addition to the 50,000 yuan for the first phase, which has already been raised by the proponents, it is proposed that the remaining 2.75 million yuan be undertaken by the municipal government over seven years, with the municipal government raising 250,000 yuan per year, the National Treasury undertaking 100,000 yuan in the first year, designated to be disbursed from the second reserve fund of the national budget for the 23rd year, and the government undertaking 150,000 yuan per year for the next six years, allocating it monthly after including it in the annual budget. The resolution was passed and the Ministry of Finance was instructed to comply and the municipal government was instructed to comply with it. The municipal government should order the Finance Bureau to send personnel to the Ministry of Finance to contact and receive the funds. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Sun Yat-sen University has submitted a letter to the Central Board of Trustees of the Boxer Indemnity, requesting the allocation of 5 million yuan to cover the cost of building new school buildings in Xiaobei, stating that the total plan requires 21 million yuan, and the central and local governments have tried to raise funds, but there is still a shortage. The Boxer Indemnity recently subsidized the University of Hong Kong. Sun Yat-sen University is an institution of higher learning in South China, and is just as important as the University of Hong Kong. If the Board of Trustees cannot allocate 5 million yuan from its regular donations, then please allocate interest payments in installments, up to a limit of 5 million yuan.

<h3 id="e22">The Saar Plebiscite and the General Situation of European Peace <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, discussions on the overall European situation have invariably focused on the Saar question. Indeed, although the Saar region spans no more than 730 square miles, the issue of its sovereignty has long been a central point of contention between France and Germany for over a century. Now that, in accordance with the provisions of the European war treaty, it is being submitted to the public will of its 780,000 people (with approximately 550,000 eligible voters) for a decision to resolve this long-standing case, regardless of the outcome of the vote, it is certainly far better than resorting to the final method of resolving it through force. It is undoubtedly something that we should highlight. However, to immediately assert that the peace of the overall European situation can be established on this basis would be overly optimistic.</p>
<p>The trend of peace in Europe truly hinges on the balance of power between France and Germany. While the resolution of sovereignty over the small Saar region may formally seem to eliminate the cause of contention between France and Germany, it is still unknown whether the tense situation of opposition between them can be eased slightly, or even deepened as a result. The Saar region is rich in all the resources of heavy industry. Aside from other factors, just considering coal and iron, they are the most abundant products of the region, and both France and Germany consider them essential for developing heavy industry. Therefore, regardless of who holds sovereignty, it is sufficient to affect the future of competition between the two countries. Moreover, according to the provisions of the peace treaty, even if Germany can achieve the victory of returning the land to its former owner through the voting process, the mineral resources underground must still be redeemed at a price. Given the current economic difficulties of Germany, is it sufficient to fully bear the funds for this redemption? Will France be willing to lower the price to accommodate? Previous reports indicated that the value was somewhat fixed, but it is feared that it will not be so easy. If this problem is not resolved, it is difficult to guarantee that disputes will not arise again. Therefore, it is not easy to be optimistic about the development of European peace based solely on the Saar plebiscite.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the conflict between France and Germany is not limited to the Saar question alone. Germany's vigorous expansion of its naval and military capabilities is also sufficient for France to feel greatly threatened in terms of hegemony. Therefore, after the breakdown of the disarmament conference, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations on the shores of Lake Geneva. The opposing side immediately proceeded to connect Central Europe and the Soviet Union, forming a large encirclement front centered on anti-German sentiment, further plunging the country into a desperate struggle for survival. Therefore, even if the Saar question is resolved, can this military issue be resolved and can everyone feel relieved? Fortunately, since the activities of the London and Rome governments, this situation of confrontation between France and Germany seems to have taken on a new appearance. The spirit of the Rome Agreement has not only allowed France to not have to seek help from the Soviet Union, but can also make the French sphere of influence in the Danube River basin free from concerns about Germany. In addition, with the support of the London government, the Berlin authorities can not only join the Danube Agreement to protect Austrian independence, but also enjoy the benefits of the abolition of military clauses in the peace treaty. If so, then Germany's military preparations can have legitimate hope through British mediation, and France's Versailles system will also increase in security day by day with the consent of Britain and Italy. If this British proposition is fully achieved, it can also stabilize the European situation somewhat. However, there are still some things that cannot be ignored. That is, after the legalization of Germany's military expansion, to what extent can France's security be maintained? This is not only a matter that France must pay close attention to while the Franco-Soviet relationship is still developing, but also whether the opposition between France and Germany can be reconciled as the London government suggests is also a major issue to consider.</p>

<p>Rumors of Matsuoka Yosuke's Succession</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 4:30 PM on the 9th, President Lin of the South Manchuria Railway exchanged views with the South Commander for an hour. As a result, due to surrounding circumstances, he decided to resign and return to Dalian the next day, the 10th. Vice President Hatta, upon receiving an invitation from the South Commander, immediately went to Changchun on the 10th to discuss various matters with the South Commander and the staff of the Kwantung Army. Therefore, President Lin will go to Tokyo from Dalian on the 14th and resign in late this month. As a result, the Kwantung Army and others are already looking for a successor, and have been in contact with Matsuoka Yosuke as the first candidate for replacement. However, Mr. Matsuoka is hesitant due to considerations for his future political life. If this cannot be achieved, Vice President Hatta may be promoted. (14th, Telecommunications News)</p>

<p>Hopes for Tangible Results in Six Years, Guarantees Cooperation from All Countries, Next Advisory Committee to Draft Investigation Plans</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the Administrative Council meeting approved the 19th Opium Advisory Committee's report on China's six-year drug prohibition plan. The resolution stated that the Administrative Council paid close attention to the Chinese representative's declaration on the Chinese government's further drug prohibition plan, no less than the Advisory Committee. Although the methods adopted by the Chinese government are different and different from those previously adopted, their purpose is the same: to eradicate drugs. The Administrative Council is not yet able to immediately judge the value of the new methods, but hopes that they will have effective results as the Chinese government expects. The Chinese representative's declaration hopes that all countries can cooperate to achieve full effectiveness, and the Administrative Council can guarantee that all countries will fulfill China's wishes. Regarding the implementation of Chapter 4 of the Hague Convention, China has agreed in principle and is willing to conduct on-site investigations with various countries. This is a success of this meeting, and it is hoped that the next Advisory Committee can draft plans to promote the realization of this investigation. As for the current situation in China, efforts should be made to vigorously implement drug prohibition. The secret manufacturing of morphine and other drugs and the import of acetic anhydride in the concessions and leased territories of China are still the most dangerous facts. During the meeting, the representatives of Spain and Portugal expressed their congratulations on China's efforts to prohibit drugs. (14th, Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Some people say that Italy intends to invite the League of Nations Administrative Council to hold one of its future meetings in Rome. However, the Italian government has not yet formally made this invitation. The League of Nations Administrative Council has held meetings in Paris, Madrid, London, Brussels, and Rome at various times. Since 1930, meetings have been regularly held in Geneva.

<p>Fearing Entanglement in European Disputes</p>
<p>(Washington) The hope of the United States joining the World Court has become a problem today. Strong opposition has arisen in some areas of Congress. They believe that joining the World Court is a shortcut to joining the League of Nations, and after joining the World Court, the United States will be dragged into European disputes and will have to accept the court's judgments, which will damage the goodwill of the losing country. Some areas also believe that the United States' foreign trade may be damaged due to having to comply with the court's judgments. Generally, when the case is submitted to the Senate, Senators Borah, Johnson, and Norris will advocate strong opposition. When President Wilson previously proposed that the United States join the League of Nations, these three were also the backbone of the opposition. (13th, National News Agency)</p>

<p>The representative Nuri explained his country's views, proving from a historical perspective that his country has legitimate rights to the left bank of the Shatt al-Arab River. He concluded that the case should be resolved based on fairness and justice, and other minor issues, such as navigation rights on the Shatt al-Arab River, can be easily resolved. The Administrative Council designated Italian representative Aloisi as the rapporteur and adjourned the meeting. It was also scheduled to hear a statement from Iranian Foreign Minister Kazemi tomorrow.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council will discuss the border dispute between Persia and Iraq tomorrow, and will also study the issue of Greek minorities in Albania. In recent weeks, as the residence permits of Albanians residing in Greece have expired, the Greek government may not allow them to continue residing. As a retaliatory measure, the Albanian government has threatened to expel Greek minorities within Albania. The conflict between the two sides is gradually becoming acute, which has attracted the attention of the Administrative Council. (13th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>When the Persian capital's parliament held a meeting today, some members raised the issue of the border dispute between Persia and Iraq and questioned the government. Prime Minister Foroughi replied that Persia has always trusted the spirit of fairness of the League of Nations and that Persia's demands are just and reasonable. It is now awaiting the results of the investigation to prove the truth and will never take retaliatory action. Foroughi then recounted the history of the dispute between the two countries, saying that Persia and Turkey signed a border demarcation agreement in 1913, but this agreement was not legally ratified, and the Persian government did not recognize its validity. Later, the Turkish government declared it invalid. This agreement contained some shortcomings and canceled Persia's rights to the Shatt al-Arab area, which Persia could not accept. Persia's rights in the Shatt al-Arab are recognized by the whole world. The Prime Minister finally said that Persia is willing to resolve the issue amicably with Iraq, but if it is handled by the League of Nations in Geneva, Persia will not object.

<p>Budapest Hungarian newspapers today published unanimous articles demanding that the League of Nations promptly handle the report submitted by the Hungarian government on the Marseille incident in accordance with the League of Nations' instructions, as the case remains unresolved and is a hindrance to the future of European peace. Therefore, it is necessary to resolve it as soon as possible. All newspapers in Budapest stated that the Hungarian government has quickly, seriously, and thoroughly investigated the case after the Marseille incident occurred and reported it to the League of Nations Administrative Council. Therefore, it is also hoped that the League of Nations authorities can treat the report with the same speed and seriousness. The Hungarian newspaper Hírlap claimed that every day the case is delayed, the atmosphere in Europe will become more tense, and the Hungarian people do not understand the reasons for the League of Nations' delay. In addition, the semi-official newspaper Pester Lloyd stated that if the case is delayed for a long time, the current tense emotions will continue to harm international relations, and the diplomatic mediation work being carried out by the authorities of various countries will be affected.</p>

<p>Confident but Still Adhering to the Policy of Peace</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet People's Committee Deputy Chairman Kubyshev detailed the unprecedented success of the Soviet Union's socialist construction in the past four years at the Moscow Soviet Congress, and then elaborated on the Soviet Union's international position. He said, "Some people regard war as an escape from the crisis and a way to resolve international disputes. Such people have increased recently, because the tense domestic economic and political situation in capitalist countries has made it so. The capitalist world is actively preparing to re-divide the world. We can see this clearly in Germany's expansion of armaments, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the failure of the London Naval Conference, Japan's cancellation of the Washington Treaty, and the crisis of the German-Austrian merger. The threat of future wars has not only not been eliminated, but the capitalist world is increasingly approaching war. The Soviet people must understand that the first target of this war is the Soviet Union. Please note that those who are attacking us are actively preparing. Our necessary task is to further strengthen our economic and political power and consolidate our national defense. For this reason, the Soviet government has always adhered to the following two basic principles: to consolidate friendly relations with other countries and to strive for peace, and to resolutely implement its diplomatic policy. At the same time, the above two principles have never changed since the establishment of the Soviet regime. The Soviet government is now vigorously implementing its policy of consolidating and expanding economic relations with other countries, but other countries must understand that we are already very strong, so we can purchase goods anywhere and at any time under conditions of mutual cooperation. Today, the Soviet Union is one of the few countries in the world that can fulfill its debts on time. The Soviet currency is also the most stable currency in the world. We have used this to build the Dneprogesstroy Plant, the Magnitogorsk Plant, the Mingyinji Automobile Plant, and other plants. The Soviet government's greatest concern is to strive for peace. The Soviet government has used all possible means in this regard.</p>
<p>Kubyshev then detailed the history of the Soviet Union's peace work in the Far East and Europe, and said, "The reactionary military-fascist group in Japan has increasingly strong aggressive tendencies, such as systematically carrying out political provocations against the Soviet Union, attacking the China Eastern Railway, border disputes, sabotaging Soviet institutions in every possible way, and arresting Soviet citizens. All of these can indicate this point. In order to be loyal to its policy of peace, the Soviet Union has tried its best to avoid being dragged into war. Although Japanese risk-takers have done everything possible to provoke, the Soviet Union has resolutely maintained its peaceful coexistence with its neighbors. We are working hard to maintain peace in the Far East and have proposed to Japan the conclusion of a non-aggression pact, which the Japanese government has not yet accepted. The Soviet Union has decided to sell the China Eastern Railway to avoid all sources of Soviet-Japanese conflict. Some people in Japan have obstructed the negotiations on the China Eastern Railway in every possible way, but the negotiations have been going on for fifteen months, and the price of the railway has been decided by both sides. At the same time, negotiations on other points of contention regarding the sale of the railway are still in progress." Kubyshev also said that the Soviet Union was invited by thirty countries to join the League of Nations. "If the Soviet Union's accession to the League is indeed the result of the Soviet Union's growing international prestige, then this move will in turn enhance the League of Nations' reputation. Our country has joined the League for a very short time, but we have repeatedly expressed our determination to demand peace. The Soviet Union fully agrees with France's proposal to conclude an Eastern European Pact, because this pact can indeed guarantee the security of the Baltic States, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Germany. At the same time, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union must separately conclude mutual assistance pacts. Czechoslovakia and the Baltic States have expressed their approval of the Eastern European Pact proposal. Germany refused to participate on the grounds of excuse, and Poland also adopted an avoiding and even opposing attitude. In December 1934, the Soviet Union and France signed a protocol, which was a serious obstacle for those who wanted to destroy the Eastern European Pact." Finally, Kubyshev stressed, "We are working for peace on the international stage. We must remember that, whether in the past or now, the strength of the Soviet state and the Red Army is the best guarantee against war and intervention." (13th, TASS News Agency)</p>

<p>(Washington) Senate silver leader Wheeler said today that the silver issue must wait until the Supreme Court rules on the "gold payment clause" test case before any action can be taken. However, once the ruling is made, the silver faction will do its utmost to fight in Congress to make silver the gold standard at a ratio of sixteen to one of gold to silver. Wheeler predicted that his proposal would pass, and said that after silver achieves gold standard status, the supply of currency can be expanded and speculation in silver can be stopped. Wheeler expressed no concern about the opposition in the Far East to the US silver purchase plan, because he had said that after silver is restored to the standard, it can help the United States compete with China and Japan in the world market. In addition, Congressman Fessinger today sent a letter to Attorney General Cummings, stating that Congress should stipulate other values that can affect the gold component value of the dollar, rather than stipulating the value of the coins themselves. Generally, Fessinger's intention is that the value of gold should be manipulated and adjusted by the market, so that financial order can be restored, domestic turmoil can be avoided, and foreign trade can be promoted.

<p>(Washington) Senate silver leader Wheeler today demanded that the silver issue should be based on the interests of the United States itself, and should not listen to the appeals of the East.

All members of the Saar Plebiscite Commission, representatives of the League of Nations, members of the Saar Governing Commission, representatives of Germany and France, as well as the commander and important officials of the international police force, will participate in the ballot counting tonight. The ballot boxes weigh a total of two tons, making transportation difficult, especially after the heavy snow. All industries in the Saar region will be suspended tomorrow to listen to the announcement of the voting results, essentially uniting all German people in the region as one family to celebrate a true people's festival. The Saar has been separated from Germany for fifteen years. If lost territory is recovered, wouldn't that be a great commemorative event? (National News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) On the day of the Saar plebiscite, key officials of the League of Nations made special arrangements to work as usual on Sunday, and every hour they communicated with the Saar Plebiscite Commission via long-distance telephone to inquire about the progress of the voting and make it public. In general, the voting was very smooth, the order was very good, and the number of voters was very enthusiastic. A radio broadcasting machine was also installed in the Great Hall of the League of Nations, preparing to announce the voting results on Tuesday morning. The League of Nations Council will convene a meeting after the voting results are announced, and there are four matters to be discussed and decided: (1) To whom will the Saar belong in the future? (2) If, according to the current trend, the people of the Saar seem to have a unanimous tendency to merge with Germany, and if the voting results require a merger with Germany, then set the date of the merger. (3) On what date will the international troops withdraw after the complete merger of the Saar becomes a reality? (4) How should public officials in the Saar region who cannot continue to be employed by Germany be subsidized after the merger of the Saar and Germany? This matter will be negotiated and coordinated by the German government and the current Saar government, and then formally recognized by the League of Nations. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>After the plebiscite in Saarbrücken concluded last night, the ballot boxes were collected from various locations by international troops and transported to the Saarbrücken building for tabulation. Large crowds gathered to watch, not dispersing throughout the night. Starting at 9 PM, several trucks began transporting the ballot boxes from various polling stations to the Saarbrücken building. This building is the property of the Evangelical Church of Saarbrücken and is built of red brick. Saarbrücken police are currently responsible for maintaining order, prohibiting curious onlookers from entering, only allowing them to stand at a considerable distance outside the building. The vote count will take place in the main hall, lasting the entire day. A large number of public officials, journalists, and film photographers crowded the steps at the entrance. The magnesium lamps of the photographers flashed, creating an interesting contrast with the moving crowd. Two British soldiers, wearing steel helmets, guarded the gate, their rifles equipped with bayonets. Another team of Italian soldiers surrounded several machine guns, providing protection outside the building. At the entrance to the vehicle passage, there were also six soldiers guarding, each with a bayonet on their rifle. Before long, the first truck carrying the ballot boxes arrived, drove through the passage, and stopped in front of the hall. Soldiers also guarded the hall door. After the ballot boxes were unloaded, they were densely arranged in the hall, waiting to be counted. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>All 862 ballot boxes in the Saar region of Saarbrücken were transported to the Saarbrücken building by 5 AM this morning. Police and British troops guarded the outside of the door, rifles equipped with bayonets. The ballot counting is scheduled to begin at 5 PM this afternoon and is expected to be completed by tomorrow morning. A total of 55,000 voters from foreign countries participated in the voting, and some of them have already departed last night, while the rest are leaving one after another. It is estimated that all of them will be able to leave by tonight. The railway authorities have made proper arrangements for transportation, so although there are many travelers, there are no delays or other accidents. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>The voting situation was very calm. The 86 polling stations closed at 8 PM tonight. Of the 539,300 voters, 98% braved the wind and snow to vote at the ballot boxes. According to general opinion, those who voted in favor of the Saar's return to Germany will account for at least 75%. However, the leader of the German Front claimed that the final election results will show that 85% of voters voted in favor of the Saar's return to Hitler's rule. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) All German newspapers unanimously predict that Germany will win a great victory in the Saar region plebiscite. The number of votes in favor of merging with Germany estimated by some newspapers, when added together, exceeds the total number of votes. Although the newspapers consider some of the measures taken by the Saar Administrative Commission and the Plebiscite Commission to maintain order to be fair, they believe that the reason why the plebiscite did not cause any incidents is due to the German Front. The German newspapers previously said that the number of Saar people who supported maintaining the status quo was very small, but now they say that a large number of those who supported maintaining the status quo have secretly fled the country. Leader and Chancellor Hitler is now in Berchtesgaden, quietly awaiting the results of the Saar vote on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Neurath may go to the Bavarian Alps on Tuesday to discuss the issues that arise after the plebiscite with Hitler. Semi-official optimists hope that the League of Nations Council can make a decision within this week. Although Germany has refused to attend the Council meeting, the German consul in Geneva may participate in the negotiations if necessary. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Many Post-Return Issues <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>If the Saar region merges with Germany, the most important issues to be resolved are as follows: (1) The issue of returning the Saar mines to Germany. (2) How to replace the French francs currently used in the Saar with marks. (3) How to change the Saar's economic system so that it does not conflict with Germany's economic system after the Saar returns. All of the above issues need to be resolved. Germany will probably seek to amend the Franco-German commercial treaty, at least during the transition period. When the Saar returns to Germany, the German government will promulgate special laws to restore the Saar region's sovereignty, and the area will be incorporated into the German Palatinate region. In addition, laws regarding the tariff system, currency restoration, and various economic measures are also being prepared. These laws will take effect from the date of the Saar's declaration of sovereignty restoration. Semi-official figures believe that Hitler will deliver a speech on Tuesday, when the results of the Saar region's vote are announced. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Unexpectedly Orderly <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>When the polling stations in Saarbrücken closed at 8 PM last night, it was estimated that 97% of the total number of voters had voted. Everything was peaceful everywhere, and the voters were very orderly. In the morning, voters gathered outside the polling stations, but in the afternoon, the polling stations felt empty. The city hall was also one of the polling stations, and crowds gathered in front of it to watch the police move the ballot boxes to the motor vehicles outside the door. When the police came out, the crowd cheered loudly, mixed with shouts of "Heil Hitler!" and performed the Nazi salute. When the open car began to drive to Saarbrücken, the crowd sang German national anthems and party songs to express their joy. The ballot boxes in Saarbrücken were all sent to the Saarbrücken building, mostly transported by train, and heavily guarded by the military. By late night, the ballot boxes were delivered one after another. As far as is known, no one who voted in favor of returning the Saar to Germany was disqualified for shouting "Heil Hitler!" or performing the Nazi salute. As the elders voted, children gathered in the streets, throwing snowballs for fun. An Italian military vehicle, equipped with a machine gun, was repeatedly hit by snowballs while patrolling the city of Saarbrücken. At dusk, residents gathered in cafes and bars to discuss the day's voting. Many firmly believe that the Saar will be returned to Germany, and some fear the future. However, because the time for selling alcohol is limited, there is little expression of joy. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>In the Saarbrücken plebiscite, the surnames of the voters were marked on the ballot boxes, placed side by side in order, so that voters could vote under the letter label of their respective surnames, which was quite convenient. However, because the German people, like the Chinese, have large families such as Zhang, Li, Chen, and Wang, special ballot boxes were added for the convenience of these people, such as "Schmidt," "Schneider," "Müller," and "Wagner." A certain Schmidt ballot box alone received 1,500 votes, and another received 1,400. Müller voted in the same place, and a certain Schneider ballot box also had more than 800 votes.

<p>The orderly nature of this vote in Saarbrücken can be attributed to the strict discipline of the German Front. However, in Neunkirchen, an anti-Nazi threw a bomb at a branch office of the German Front, slightly injuring one person. Another anti-Nazi burned a swastika flag. Police arrested two immigrants and two communists. At the same time, France and the Netherlands closed their borders. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>The plebiscite in Saarbrücken has passed quietly, with only a few minor incidents to spice things up. A bomb was thrown into the German automobile club in Neunkirchen, which is the local Nazi headquarters. It is now believed that the bomber was a communist who also fired shots at the pursuers, injuring one person. One communist was arrested in Saar Louis. His apartment contained eight bombs, 200 hand grenades, and 60 pounds of explosives. An 82-year-old woman died at a polling station in Hostatte. It is not known whether she voted. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

As a result, she was exhausted when she arrived here. When she arrived at her destination by car, she was beaming with joy after voting, as if to show that she had fulfilled her responsibility.

<p>When the city hall took away the ballot boxes in Saarbrücken, the German Front made a demonstration. When the first ballot box appeared in front of the city hall, the song "Germany Above All" began to be sung. A Nazi leader sang the first verse, followed by the crowd singing "Saar Song" and "Nazi Party Song," all voices singing in unison. In the evening, the Nazi Party headquarters declared that the propaganda campaign was coming to an end, and the entire group went to the municipal theater to watch the play "William Tell" (a hero from the early 14th century). This play is a work by Schiller, and the singing was very noisy. The main oppressor in the play is Gessler, and William Tell opposes Gessler. During today's performance, the crowd mocked Gessler to make fun of him. Although William Tell is regarded as a national hero by everyone, opinions differ on his resistance. Some regard him as resisting foreign oppression, while others regard him as opposing Hitler's dictatorship. But the theater situation was still peaceful last night. At the request of the German Front, the theater manager deleted the most rebellious verses in the play. Usually, when these verses were sung, people would fight each other, but now they have been deleted, so there is less noise. After the play, the staff of the headquarters accompanied the crowd to the Saarbrücken building, where the ballot boxes were gathered. At midnight, the whole city was quiet, with no flags or lights, which was contrary to expectations. The streets were almost empty. On the night of the plebiscite, all the people of the Saar went to sleep together. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Voting Suppressed by Nazis, Violates Conditions of Freedom and Secrecy</p>
<p>The leaders of the status quo faction in Saarbrücken, Plang and Volte, invited foreign journalists tonight to express their protest against the course of the plebiscite. Plang declared that the Saar police exercised their duties, obviously with fraudulent circumstances. The police secretly followed the orders of the Nazi Party and did not patrol. Many international troops also did not patrol, so the residents had the impression that the vote had been controlled by the Nazi Party's security and storm troopers. In addition, cleaners and fire brigades were also mostly inclined to the German Front. Leaflets were distributed throughout the Saar region, saying that the socialist leader Plang, the Catholic leader Hoffmann, and the communist leader Volte had fled. In fact, all this was fabricated by the Nazi trade union, because these three people did attend and entertained foreign journalists tonight. Plang also said that voters from Germany to the Saar region must first swear an oath to vote in favor of the Nazi Party, so the leaders of the status quo faction solemnly declared that because of the above circumstances, this vote cannot be considered a free and secret vote. The League of Nations has a binding obligation to hold votes under conditions of freedom and secrecy, but since this obligation cannot be fulfilled, the results of the vote should be reserved. Plang also declared that he would negotiate with the League of Nations. Communist leader Volte told foreign journalists that he firmly opposed Hitler to the end, saying that if international agencies cannot protect human freedom, then rather than endure oppression, we should take the most extreme measures to achieve the final goal.

He came to the Saar with his family to fulfill his voting obligations and participate in the plebiscite. A reporter from the Swiss Telegraph Agency interviewed him and obtained his comments, in which he said that the European war or peace will be decided by this plebiscite. He declined to predict the voting results, only saying that the results would be unusually important and could create a new relationship between France and Germany, with a view to contributing to European peace. Finally, Papen mentioned the garden he had built in Voltaire and could not help but sigh, saying, "Today, people are dominated by political desires and compete endlessly.

The Saar newspaper said, "The current struggle has come to an end, and people of all levels are relieved." On the other hand, the newspapers of the socialist and communist joint front expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of the League of Nations institutions towards Nazi activities yesterday. They all said that the responsibility for maintaining order in Saarbrücken was actually in the hands of the Nazi Party's security team and storm troopers. As the New Saar Post said, "The German Front directs its members to swagger through the city, saying that their intention is not to provoke, but also to threaten voters. How can this be?" The Ordinary Guidance newspaper said, "The impression felt by neutral observers is that the order is well-established and not chaotic. But who knows that this is only a superficial situation? The German Front is exerting secret pressure on voters, creating an environment of hesitation, panic, and fear. Where is the so-called free voting?" (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>▲The Bombay large bar silver market was quiet today, with the spot closing price at 64 rupees and 15 annas, up 7 annas.</p>
<p>(Exchange Rates) ▲In the London foreign exchange market this morning, the US dollar was in slightly higher demand, and the British pound showed a slight downward trend. The opening exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was $4.90625, which was .125 lower than the closing rate on Saturday and Sunday. It later narrowed significantly. The most recent price is $4.900625, which is .05625 lower than the opening price. One US dollar equals 4 shillings and .0973 British pounds. ▲The opening rate between the British pound and the French franc was 74 francs and 21, which was 7 pounds lower than on Saturday and Sunday. It then fell by another 6 pounds to 74 francs and 15. This price remained unchanged until the time of dispatch.</p>
<p>▲In the New York foreign exchange market, the British pound was weak. The opening exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound was $4.89875, which was .0875 lower than the closing rate on Saturday and Sunday. It then fell by another .0375 to $4.895.</p>
<p>(Cotton and Wheat) ▲New York Cotton: Before the cotton market opened, it was generally expected that the market conditions would not change much. However, after the opening, there were many transactions, and prices rose by 2 to 4 points. Industry insiders still bought a lot, mostly for settlement purposes. Prices gradually increased slightly. ▲New York Wheat: The Chicago wheat market opened steadily, with no change in prices. Before long, due to profit-taking by bulls, the market price fell slightly. The weather is very cold, but it is necessary to consider that European demand may decrease.</p>
<p>▲Bombay Cotton: Today's cotton market saw futures traders buying in large quantities, while Japanese and European exporters sold. The closing price for the April-May delivery of white Broach cotton was 140 rupees and 25, down 2 and a half rupees. Market sentiment at the close was stable.</p>

<p>▲New York: Trading was light at the opening today, and prices rose slightly by one pound. (Securities) ▲New York: Before the market opened today, a factor favorable to market conditions was that the steel industry reported that steel mills were operating at 45.5% of capacity last week. Therefore, the steel industry is gradually becoming profitable. It is estimated that steel mills in the Youngstown area will reach 5% of their capacity this week. The factor unfavorable to market conditions is the panic regarding the gold standard issue. Although it had a great impact on the securities market on Friday and Saturday, it continues to be a concern. The securities market opened this morning with stable market conditions, with only slight fluctuations. It is said that the downward trend has reached a level that could attract buying interest, but the market does not yet appear to be calm. According to news this morning, a group called the United Automobile Shareholders Committee is launching a movement to directly contact automobile shareholders, advocating that the major American automobile companies be merged into a single large group.</p>
<p>According to a Reuter's report, the results of the gold standard issue are still uncertain, and the securities market is still subject to its influence. Although some people believe that the downward trend is already significant, it is generally expected that if President Roosevelt does not take any unexpected actions, securities prices will continue to decline. The market opened this morning with relatively stable market conditions, and the upward and downward trends were not significant. However, the overall sentiment remains fearful. Market conditions today are expected to be mixed. The market prices of New York securities are listed below:</p>

<p>Strategies Decided, General Offensive Scheduled, Remnants Plan to Use Both Offense and Defense</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Liu Xiang's visit to Chiang Kai-shek and his return to Sichuan, followed by the westward march of the General Headquarters' Staff Corps, the military affairs of bandit suppression in Sichuan Province have gone from dormancy to tension. Liu Xiang also telegraphed all generals to go to Chongqing after the Staff Corps arrived in Chongqing to hold a bandit suppression conference. Commanders Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Li Jiqi, Yang Sen, Tang Shizun, Liu Bangjun, and others have all arrived in response to the call. In recent days, they have visited Liu Xiang and He Guoguang, the director of the General Headquarters' Staff Corps, to report on the military situation of each army. The official conference is scheduled to be held on the 11th. The allocation of troops, the replenishment of munitions, and the routes of offense and defense will be decided at this meeting, and then a general suppression will be scheduled. It is said that the Red Army is focusing on defense along the Jialing River and offense in the Sui Xuan area, and the deployment is also very busy. Xu Haidong's remnant bandits on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui seem to have entered Sichuan from the Shaanxi border. The remnant bandits in Wanyuan Kou are trying to respond, but Xu's army has been fleeing through several provinces and has no combat power. Even if they enter Sichuan, they will not be a significant force for the Sichuan bandits. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Yu Xuezhong Cables Beijing, Urging Blocking of Yellow River Breach <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>No Dry Land Remains Within Changyuan City; Part of the Hutuo River Project Completed</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The post-disaster works for blocking the Yellow River breach in southern Hebei, since the abolition of the Yellow River Post-Disaster Works Office, has been the responsibility of the Yellow River Conservancy Bureau. There are four breaches in total: (1) Chelezhuang, (2) Jiugulu, (3) Xiangliwan, and (4) Buzhai. According to the survey by the Conservancy Bureau, these four breaches are easy to construct but difficult to execute. This is because the water flow from the Yellow River breach originates from the Guantaigou in Henan Province. The water flows through the old course of the Yellow River, rushes into the depressions, and directly reaches the four breaches, inundating the area around Changyuan County. To block the four breaches, it is necessary to first block Guantaigou to cut off the water flow; otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve success. Previously, the Central Yellow Disaster Relief Commission stipulated that the funds for blocking Guantaigou alone would require more than 110,000 yuan. The difficulty and magnitude of the project can be imagined. Unexpectedly, as the project was underway, a sudden surge of cold water caused the water level in Guantaigou to rise sharply. The torrential flow caused the water that had receded from the vicinity of Changyuan to rise again by two to three feet, or even four to five feet. The workers at the four breaches were ordered by the Conservancy Bureau and the Magistrate of Changyuan County to gather at Guantaigou day and night to rush the blocking, in order to prevent danger. However, the disaster relief materials needed locally, such as sorghum stalks, sacks, and sand, were not easily obtained. The willow branches in the surrounding areas had all been cut down. Furthermore, the project funds exceeded the budget, causing a sense of financial strain. Although the Conservancy Bureau and the Magistrate were desperately trying to block the flow, the situation remained critical. Fortunately, the water stopped rising on the 8th of this month. If the water level drops slightly in the future, the people of Dongming, Changyuan, and Puyang counties may not suffer another disaster. The accumulated water outside Changyuan City, after prolonged soaking, has connected with the water inside the city. The water depth reaches thirteen or fourteen feet in the deepest places, and eight or nine feet even in the shallowest. The four hundred villages around the city are all in the middle of the water. The higher ground in the county seat, with four streets, had never been flooded before, but now there is no place that is not submerged. Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Hebei Province has sent consecutive telegrams reporting the disaster and requesting funds. In addition to ordering the Yellow Disaster Relief Committee and the Construction Department to appropriately allocate funds for emergency dispatch to the construction site, he sent a telegram to the Central Yellow Disaster Relief Committee and the Henan Provincial Government on the 11th, requesting the rapid allocation of funds to block and repair Guantaigou, in order to prevent the submergence of the three counties in southern Hebei.</p>
<p>Hu Yuanhui, Director of the Hebei Construction Department, recently inspected the Hutuo River irrigation project site with Lu Muting, Director of the Finance Department. They returned to Tianjin the night before last from Lingshou. According to Hu, seventy percent of the water diversion project in the high-water area of the Hutuo River has been completed. All the machinery used has been ordered from England and Germany and is expected to arrive at the construction site for use in early next month. Once the project is completed, the irrigation project will be fully completed and is scheduled to begin releasing water on May 1 this year. Approximately 120,000 mu of land in Lingshou and Zhengding counties can be irrigated. The area was originally very barren, but will become fertile farmland, benefiting the people. The local farmers mainly grow cotton. In the future, the department will guide the improvement of cotton varieties to increase yields. Since the department merged into the Department of Industry, the first thing it has focused on is the improvement of cotton varieties. Most cotton farmers in the cotton-producing areas of the province are clinging to old methods. The department will vigorously promote American cotton varieties in order to improve the quality of cotton production. (11th)</p>

<p>Sparkling and Dazzling; the Larger Ones are Like Fingers</p>
<p>Huizhou dispatch: Crystal is quartz crystallized from amethyst, a precious and valuable substance. Although China is rich in mineral resources, crystal mines are rare. In previous years, they have been produced in Majiang, Fujian Province, and Guyang, Suiyuan Province, but the crystals were not fully transparent and were not considered perfect. The mountains in Huizhou are crisscrossed, and the flowing sand often forms minerals. Recently, crystal stones were discovered in the mountains behind Luotian Village in the northern part of She County. The shapes are like geometric polyhedra, sparkling and dazzling. The smaller ones are like rice grains, and the larger ones are like fingers. Large pieces are very rare. According to the villagers, the mountains are rugged with numerous strange rocks, and there are many white stones similar to un-crystallized, non-transparent crystals. Without expert investigation, it is unknown whether there are large quantities of crystal mines in the area. (January 8th)</p>

<p>The homes of farmers Zhang Changyu and Zhang Jinghua along the railway in Cangqiao South Zhujia Village in this city were suddenly raided by seven or eight armed bandits around 8 PM on the 13th. They looted over 1,400 cash coins and a long gown. Before leaving, they fired a shot as a warning. Upon receiving the report, the County Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a special task force and police from the Second and Third Precincts to pursue, but the bandits had already escaped without a trace. The home of Xu Xiaoguan in Pan Ku Village, Caojing Sixth Ward, was also raided by multiple bandits around 10 PM on the 11th. They looted cloth clothing and fur robes, etc. The homeowner's grandmother, Madam Wan, and mother, Madam Feng, were both scalded on the head and face, causing extreme pain. Some of the bandits were carrying guns. Furthermore, the homes of Fan Shouyun and Fan Bosheng, villagers of Wangjia Ku Village in Sijing, were also robbed on the night of the 10th. However, as the loot was insufficient, they forced Bosheng's younger brother, Yougen, to lead them to the home of Bao Chengzhang in the same village, tricking him into opening the door and carrying out the robbery. They looted over 130 silver dollars, gold rings weighing about two taels, and clothing, fur robes, and other items worth over a hundred dollars. Before leaving, they fired over a dozen shots as a warning before fleeing with the loot. The active bandits in the four townships during the winter defense period are evident.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction recently stated that the Agriculture Promotion Institutes established in various counties were primarily intended to promote sericulture knowledge and guide silkworm rearing skills. After the implementation of unified cocoon management by the Industrial Department last year, each county established Sericulture Improvement Areas or Model Areas to supervise the Promotion Institutes and comprehensively manage sericulture improvement. Due to the provincial treasury's financial constraints and the difficulty of funding industrial projects in each county, all Agriculture Promotion Institutes in each county have been abolished. Yesterday, a special order was issued to County Magistrate Yan of this county to abolish the County Agriculture Promotion Institute immediately. All matters that the institute should handle will be managed by the Sericulture Model Area.</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Shanghai Exchange Stabilization Committee Purchases Silver to Support the Market; First Batch Arrives in Shanghai and Deposited in Three Banks <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Total of 420,000 Yuan; Second Batch to Arrive Soon; Money Supply Gradually Loosening; Foreign Exchange Rates Drop to 11 Cents</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee purchased 200,000 taels of silver from Hong Kong. After completing the formalities, they were shipped to Shanghai in batches. To prevent piracy, the names and schedules of the ships were kept strictly confidential. The first batch, loaded onto the British ship “R威品狄," arrived in Shanghai the night before last, totaling 84 boxes, each containing 5,000 yuan, all in commonly used Chinese silver coins, totaling 420,000 yuan. They were unloaded yesterday under the strict protection of detectives to prevent theft.</p>
<p>(Deposited in Three Banks) The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee decided to deposit the 20 million yuan of silver purchased in the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to regulate the Shanghai financial market. The first batch of 410,000 yuan was completely deposited in the Bank of China yesterday. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Zhang Peishen, a member of the committee, who said that the silver purchased has been shipped to Shanghai in batches, with the first batch already arrived to stabilize the market. The second batch will arrive soon. (Regulating Finance) The reporter learned from banking circles that the silver purchased by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee is planned to be fully transported before the annual closing of accounts to regulate the accounts. If the silver and money industries need it, they can borrow from the committee. Since the committee purchased silver and shipped it to Shanghai, the money supply in Shanghai has gradually loosened, and the foreign exchange rates opened by the money market have fallen from the peak of two dimes and one cent.</p>

(2) A joint petition will be submitted to the City Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the National Government, the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and other agencies, requesting that the tax be temporarily suspended for the sake of maintaining commerce during this time of economic recession.

<h3 id="e115">Xiamen Bank's Shanghai Branch Still Open for Business Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Deposits Were Only 30,000 to 40,000 Yuan; All Were Returned to Depositors Yesterday</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The Xiamen Commercial Bank's Xiamen head office was forced to suspend operations on the 12th of this month due to a run on the bank. The bank has a branch on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai and an office in Ningbo. A reporter from the Central News Agency, because the bank's branch has been in Shanghai for many years and has had an impact on society, specifically visited Mr. Lu Baomin, the director of the branch's business department. According to him:</p>
<p>(History of the Bank) The Xiamen Bank was established on June 1, 1920. On May 9, 1921, it registered with the Beijing government for a term of 30 years. It is a limited liability company with a total capital of 1.2 million yuan and a paid-up capital of 660,000 yuan, divided into 12,000 shares. Last year, after the paid-up capital reached 750,000 yuan, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for registration. In 1926, a branch was added on Minkuo Road in Shanghai, which was then moved to Ningbo Road. Last year, it moved to its current address. Later, an office was also established in Ningbo. The branch and office do not have independent capital and have not applied for registration. Although they are called branches, they are actually no different from offices, specializing in domestic and international remittances and export financing, mortgage loans and guaranteed beneficial loans, acting as agents for the purchase and sale of securities, bullion, and currencies of various countries, managing deposits and safekeeping, etc. (Reasons for Suspension) The head office's capital is all in Xiamen. The chairman, Liao Zhonghe, and the general manager, Ouyang Ze, each have a money shop in Xiamen, one named Yufeng and the other named Jieshun. Recently, because Xiamen's commerce has declined sharply, the silver and money industries have suffered fatal blows. The money shops were successively forced to close due to runs on the bank. People in Xiamen knew that the two money shops were opened by the chairman and manager of the Xiamen Bank, so they suspected that the bank was also empty and spread the news, causing a run on the bank. The authorities were unable to cope with the situation due to insufficient deposits, so they announced a temporary suspension of operations for seven days starting on the 12th. Now they have extended it to the 15th.</p>
<p>(Branch Situation) The Shanghai branch originally had no fixed capital. However, because the management's skills were still stable, the business was not bad. It is said that the loans amount to approximately 300,000 yuan, while the deposits are only 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The same is true for the Ningbo office. After receiving the telegram from the head office announcing the suspension of operations, the key personnel of the branch held meetings all night the day before yesterday, finally deciding to continue operations yesterday at 3 a.m. This is because, on the one hand, the deposits are limited, and the branch has sufficient preparations to manage them. Moreover, most of these deposits are fixed-term deposits. When deposits were made at an interest rate of 8%, they can now be returned at an interest rate of 3%, which is actually beneficial for the bank. On the other hand, the loans amount to more than 300,000 yuan. If operations are suspended, it will be difficult to recover all of them. In summary, all deposits were returned to depositors from morning to night yesterday. However, those who still wanted to deposit were refused to avoid adding procedures in the future. The same is true for the Ningbo office. Therefore, there were no losses to the depositors. (Future Plans) Mr. Lu also said that the branch will continue to operate for the time being, pending the resolution of the Xiamen shareholders' meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Ministry of Railways Approves Issuance of Bonuses to Employees of Two Railways <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Totaling 585,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Regarding the issuance of bonuses to employees of the two railways for 1934, it was previously ordered by the Ministry to be calculated by the Accounting Department according to the Ministry's calculation form for year-end bonuses and four attached forms, and the amount of the bonus was calculated. It is said that the two percent of the net profit of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in 1934 to issue bonuses at the rate of one month's salary is short of 64,470 yuan. However, the calculation of two percent of the net profit of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway exceeds the amount needed to issue one month's salary by 57,160 yuan. Therefore, the surplus will offset the shortfall, and the total bonus will be approximately equivalent to one month's salary. The total amount of this bonus is approximately 585,000 yuan. The Bureau submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways on December 24, 1934, which has now been approved by the Ministry's order No. 2626. All offices were immediately ordered to register the employees and amounts entitled to bonuses in accordance with the regulations and report them to the Accounting Department for batch issuance after verification.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Preparatory Committee of the Ministry of Industry's Wenxi Paper Mill Held Third Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Decided on Method of Distributing Commercial Shares</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency: The newspaper paper mill prepared in cooperation between the Ministry of Industry and the business community held its third preparatory committee meeting at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. The attendees included Vice Minister Liu Weichi of the Ministry of Industry, Director Liu Yin of the Industrial Department, Xu Jiqing, Huang Suchu, Lu Feibo, Wang Yunwu, Wang Boqi, Xu Shanxiang, and Gu Yuquan. Chaired by Vice Minister Liu, the meeting began with a report on the recent progress of the preparatory work and negotiations with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board for borrowing the Boxer Indemnity. The meeting then discussed the distribution method of the 1.2 million yuan of commercial shares. It was resolved that 600,000 yuan would be allocated to the newspaper industry, 400,000 yuan to the weaving industry, and 200,000 yuan to the Shanghai and Wenzhou business communities, and responsible fundraisers were designated to carry out the fundraising separately. In addition, it was proposed to invite the Zhejiang Provincial Government to join the cooperation and to invite the Shen Bao newspaper to recommend a person in charge to join the preparatory committee to continue the legacy of Mr. Shi Liangcai. The meeting adjourned at 6 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Jian'an Ship Sank in Tongzhou <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Ship Aground During Rescue and Split into Two Sections; Passengers and Crew Safe; Most Cargo Lost</p>
<p>The Jian'an ship, a Yangtze River vessel owned by the British company Taikoo, was launched on the night of the 11th and sailed to Tiansheng Port and Yaojian Shijian in Tongzhou. Due to the fog at night, the ship mistakenly entered a shallow beach. There were many stone pillars on the riverbank, and the bottom of the Jian'an ship was damaged by the stone pillars, causing water to enter the cabin. On the morning of the 12th, the company urgently dispatched four ships, including the Zhuting small steamship and a tugboat, to the site to rescue the passengers. First, dozens of passengers were rescued onto the barge. Then, the hatches were opened, and part of the cargo was unloaded. The towing and rescue work began on the afternoon of the 13th.</p>
<p>(Ship Split in Two) On the night of the 13th, while the ship was being towed, a certain Yangtze River vessel was launched and passed through Tongzhou. The captain of the Jian'an ship negotiated with the captain of the passing vessel to request assistance in towing. In accordance with the sea rescue regulations, the captain agreed to tow the ship. However, because the Jian'an ship was old and deeply mired in the sand, the passing vessel opened full power to tow it away from the shallow beach. At that time, the bottom of the Jian'an ship hit a reef (i.e., stone pillars), causing the ship's body to split into two sections. The bow and stern separated from the middle cabin, causing it to sink immediately. The crew and sailors each sought escape routes and competed to board other vessels. Fortunately, the passengers had been rescued earlier and were not harmed. The company's Yangtze River vessels, including the Wuchang, also arrived in Tongzhou and assisted in the rescue. The front and rear sections of the Jian'an ship sank in less than a quarter of an hour. Currently, the ship's masts can still be seen slightly above the river surface.</p>
<p>(Loss of Ship and Cargo) The Jian'an ship had a displacement of 1,770 tons and was built in Shanghai in 1907. It was originally used for flood routes in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Because of the shallow water in winter, it was changed to the Shanghai-Hankou route. This time, it was launched from Hankou and carried over 10,000 pieces of cargo. Except for a portion that had been unloaded by three barges, sixty percent remained inside the ship, so the losses were quite large. Less than 100 first, second, third-class, and steerage passengers were rescued and brought to Shanghai by other ships, arriving safely in Shanghai the night before last. The total loss of the ship and cargo is at least 200,000 yuan or more. Currently, a ship from the Chinese Navy is stationed at the site of the sunken ship to protect it. The company received a telegram yesterday about the sinking of the Jian'an and immediately decided to send the general shipowner, Guo Lefu, to inspect the site.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Urgent Disaster Relief: Donations Pouring In From All Directions <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Urgent Disaster Relief General Donation Committee has received enthusiastic donations from all sides, truly relying on the warm support of all sectors of the city for the disaster areas. Yesterday, the committee received a letter from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, forwarding the general donations of all its employees, amounting to 600 yuan. They also deducted one day's wages from the workers, totaling 347 yuan and 9 cents, adding up to 947 yuan and 9 cents, and sent someone to deliver it to the committee for counting. In addition, the Sino-French Pharmacy donated 100 yuan and also delivered 20 yuan they had collected on behalf of others to the committee.</p>
<p>Since the Urgent Disaster Relief General Donation Committee began its work, the enthusiasm for making donations has been very high. It is said that Mr. Zhu Douwen also followed the prescribed donation amount and sent someone to deliver the funds to the committee for counting. There are still other wealthy individuals making donations, and we will report on them later. As for the previous letters sent by the committee to Liu Chengru, Zheng Bozhao, Luo Jialing, Ji Juemi, and others to solicit general donations, and the reminders sent by the committee, many days have passed without any response. It is said that the committee will adopt other methods to deal with Liu, Zheng, and others if they continue to not respond, and once announced, they will not be tolerated by society.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Bank received 120 yuan deducted from workers' general donations by the Yu Shenghong Construction Factory, 109 yuan and 5 jiao donated by the Xingxinji No. 5 Factory, and 50 yuan donated by the Youlian Cotton Weaving Factory. It is also reported that yesterday, institutions such as Jinan University and Chongsan Primary School went to the Urgent Disaster Relief General Donation Committee to collect general donation receipts, which have already been issued separately.</p>

<p>Returning to Shanghai After a Week, then Touring Guangdong and Guangxi</p>
<p>Baron Guillaume de Bassompierre, the Belgian Minister to China, and his wife, will depart at 3:00 PM today aboard the Dollar Steamship Line's President Hoover for a tour of the Philippines. They plan to stay in the Philippines for a week and then return to Hong Kong by ship, before proceeding to tour Guangdong and Guangxi. The Belgian Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Delfosse, plans to go to Shanghai in a week to wait for the Belgian Minister and his wife to return to Shanghai and then travel with them to various places. It is reported that the Belgian Minister and his party are expected to return to Shanghai in mid-February.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Shanghai-Ningbo Route Will Be Transformed into the Shanghai-Zhenhai Line <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The competition between Shanghai and Ningbo has come to an end. Yesterday, the four companies signed an agreement to continue their cooperation. However, the route will suddenly be changed to the Shanghai-Zhenhai line. We will restate the situation below to clarify the true picture: (Mingxing Can Sail the Yangtze River) After deliberation by the four companies, the Sanbei Shipping Company's new ship, Mingxing, will fundamentally cease operating on the Ningbo route. However, while the other ships are being repaired, the Mingxing will be formally added to the Shanghai-Ningbo line as a substitute. As for the Mingxing's future formal route, it will operate on the Yangtze River line between Shanghai and Hankou. Based on this principle, the companies will continue to discuss the continued cooperation of the Shanghai-Ningbo ships. The agreement is currently being discussed and drafted.</p>
<p>(China Merchants Also Goes to Zhenhai) This time, the competition between Shanghai and Ningbo has led to the mutual opening of Zhenhai port. Because Zhenhai is an inland port, goods to and from it can generally be exempted from customs duties. Sanbei has already obtained the approval of the Customs Commissioner to proceed accordingly. Therefore, in the future, Ningbo goods will be transported by land to Zhenhai and then transferred to ships to enjoy tax-free benefits. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also decided to dispatch the new Jiangtian ship to operate on this route. The Ning Shao Company's new Ning Shao will also adopt the same method. In the future, the ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line will be transformed into the Shanghai-Zhenhai line, with Ningbo becoming a secondary port, insignificant in terms of business.</p>
<p>(British Ships Fall Behind) Originally, among the four companies operating on the Ningbo route, Jardine Matheson's (Taigu) business was the largest, consistently ranking first. Since the cooperation, although they accounted for eleven shares, they still had to allocate and distribute profits to companies with insufficient shares or revenue. Now, due to the Mingxing's price war, the route is being transformed, and Ningbo will become a port for passengers to embark and disembark. Goods to and from Shanghai will gradually be loaded and unloaded at Zhenhai, greatly reducing customs duties for merchants. However, since Jardine Matheson is a foreign shipping company, it cannot berth at the inland port of Zhenhai to transport goods. As a result, after the new route is opened, the business of British ships will fall behind. This is truly unexpected.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter Requesting the Dismissal of a Lawless Foreign Constable <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>No. 1 Constable Abuses a Vendor</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, based on a petition from the Fruit Vendors Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, sent a letter to the Public Works Department, which stated: "To whom it may concern: We have received a petition from the Fruit Vendors Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, which states: 'We, the petitioners, are all engaged in selling fruit in the special district, holding business licenses issued by the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement. We abide by the rules and regulations and have been in business for many years. Although our business is small, it is a legitimate business, and we earn a small profit to support our families and avoid starvation. Last year, we were disturbed by vagrants, which led to the police sending cars to arrest us, making it impossible for us to do business. Fortunately, we received assistance from your association, which allowed us to conduct our business in peace. For more than five months now, the economic situation has been difficult, and we have been abiding by the rules and laws and have not committed any illegal acts. Moreover, our business is based on borrowing at high interest rates. Recently, the police have been dispatching Chinese and foreign constables to various roads day and night to interfere with our business and prevent us from selling. Now, at the end of the lunar year, the business income of all businesses, large and small, depends on this season. The livelihood of several family members depends on this season, otherwise, we will be left to die. Currently, we have witnessed several of our colleagues suffering from beatings by foreign constables, and many are not allowed to do business. Among them, Wang Laifa suffered the most. On the afternoon of the tenth of this month, at about 1:00 PM, he was arrested by Constable No. 195 at the entrance of Songjiang Lane on Zhejiang Road and taken to the police station. Wang Laifa repeatedly pleaded with the head of the police station and was finally released. He continued to do business at the original location at the entrance of Songjiang Lane, but was seen again by Constable No. 195, who not only did not allow him to do business, but also punched and kicked him without regard for his life. Most incomprehensibly, he made him carry his load on his shoulders and paraded him around on the road, making him walk in large circles to Yuegui Lane at the intersection of Zhejiang Road, Wuma Road, and Shilu, and then to Ziyoufang at the end of Wuhu Road, Shandong Road, and Wuma Road, and then back to Songjiang Lane at the intersection of Wuma Road, Liuma Road, and Zhejiang Road. Along the way, he was not allowed to stop to rest, and if he wanted to stop, he would be punched and kicked many times. Later, he was unable to carry the load and had no other choice but to throw the load in Songjiang Lane. He was sweating profusely and collapsed on the ground. Passersby and all his colleagues, seeing this situation, felt very sorry for him and pooled their money to hire a rickshaw to take him to the police station to report everything. The police chief sent someone to Renji Hospital for treatment. Hundreds of our colleagues witnessed this and were deeply saddened. We have submitted this petition to your association, requesting you to forward a letter to the Public Works Department, asking the police station not to oppress us without cause, so that we can conduct our business in peace and avoid being unable to make a living. Everything is true, and we ask you to send someone to investigate, and you will know that we are not lying. We beg you to have compassion and present this petition.'" The letter continued, "We have checked that peddlers within the settlement have already paid taxes and received licenses issued by your department. Police officers and constables should not engage in illegal actions against law-abiding peddlers. In recent years, commerce has declined, and the general public has found it difficult to make a living. Being able to make a living as a peddler is a sign of being a law-abiding and good citizen. If, as stated in the petition, your department's police officers interfere with the livelihoods of these citizens, making it impossible for these law-abiding and good citizens to make a living and driving them to take risks, what benefit will this kind of action have for the police administration? Even from a human perspective, the actions of the foreign constable are particularly cruel, inhumane, and contrary to your department's original intention of protecting good citizens. Based on the foregoing, we believe that your department should be requested to conduct a thorough investigation and order the dismissal of Constable No. 195 to deter others and ensure that citizens can make a living."</p>

<p>The Great Evening News reported that Mrs. Wodard, a well-known figure in the Shanghai press, recently passed away due to illness. Yesterday, her husband, Mr. Wodard, held an unprecedented funeral in Shanghai. He chartered an airplane from the China National Aviation Corporation, accompanied by two friends, and took his wife's cremated ashes into the air. They flew around the entire city and then scattered the ashes over the racecourse, in accordance with the wishes of the deceased and with the consent of her parents in California.</p>

<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that there were rumors that an earthquake would occur in Shanghai on the 5th of next month. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the observatory has not released any such information. However, according to a scholar of calendrical phenomena, the previous statement is not entirely unfounded. Last year, a minor earthquake occurred in Shaanxi, and prior calculations were only slightly off in terms of the date. It is impossible to predict whether the previous rumor that Shanghai would experience an earthquake is accurate as to whether the earthquake will begin on the afternoon of the 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Completes Registration of Old Revenue Stamps and Submits a Report <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Measures for the Registration of Old Revenue Stamps on November 8 of last year, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce organized a Registration Office for Old Revenue Stamps and began registering old stamps on November 28. As of December 31, the registration had been completed, with a total of 1,029 cases, amounting to 22,352 yuan, 2 jiao, and 1 fen in tax stamps. In accordance with Article 8 of the Measures promulgated by the Ministry, the Chamber of Commerce has submitted the original application forms and a report to the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Revenue Bureau for submission to the Ministry of Finance for review.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Ministry of Finance Approves Chamber of Commerce Interpretation of Foreign Merchants' Responsibility for Not Affixing Stamps <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Violations of Certificates Should Still be Penalized and Taxes Paid After Punishment; Litigation Should Not be Suspended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Egg Industry Association requesting an interpretation of whether certificates without revenue stamps affixed by foreign merchants would be considered valid in court if disputes arose over price fluctuations or even litigation. The Chamber of Commerce believed that if certificates without stamps were not considered legal, the result would be that foreign merchants would evade taxes and be exempt from fulfilling their contractual obligations, causing Chinese merchants to suffer double losses. On [unable to read] of last month, the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting instructions. This was reported previously. The Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday explaining the matter. The original text is as follows: "We have read the telegram of [unable to read]. According to the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax and Article 3 of the Implementing Rules, judicial organs should not suspend the proceedings of litigation when litigants violate the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, but should punish them according to the regulations. In addition, Article 21 of the Stamp Tax Law, which will be implemented on a fixed date, stipulates that when judicial organs discover certificates that violate this law when hearing cases, they should be punished according to this law. Article 22 of the same law stipulates that the persons responsible for certificates that violate this law should still be ordered to pay the stamp tax at the applicable tax rate after punishment. Therefore, if a certificate without stamps is involved in litigation, it should be punished and ordered to be stamped, and the litigation should not be suspended. The second point of concern in the original letter from the Egg Industry Association is not a problem. You should inform them of this approval."</p>

<h3 id="e129">After the Heavy Fog, There Will Be Wind and Rain; the Climate in Shanghai is Changing Greatly <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Severe Weather and Epidemics; Transportation and Ships are Hindered Again</p>
<p>Since the heavy fog on the 10th, Shanghai has experienced continuous overcast skies, wind, and rain, making the climate very suffocating. Last night, it rained again, and yesterday morning, a strong wind and torrential rain suddenly arose. At 12:20 PM, the rain was mixed with snow pellets, making a sound against the roof tiles, but it soon stopped, and light rain continued to fall intermittently until late at night. Hygienists should pay attention.</p>
<p>(Diseases) Due to the severe weather, infectious diseases are still rampant in Shanghai. According to a report from the Zhabei Infectious Disease Hospital, there were 24 cases of diphtheria, 6 cases of scarlet fever, and 2 cases of meningitis last week. No cases of smallpox have been found yet, but prevention is urgently needed. The previous report of more than 20 cases of scarlet fever per day was a misreport. Spring crops such as beans, wheat, and vegetables will also be damaged.</p>
<p>(Transportation) In the midst of wind and rain, transportation is inevitably disrupted. Rickshaw pullers struggled in the wind and rain, and business was even slower. The entry and exit of ships were also delayed. The Jardine Matheson's Taigu, the New Beijing, the Ningshao's New Ningshao, and the Daxing Hongxing, among others on the Ningbo route, were able to depart on time because the rain had stopped after the incense offerings. Foreign ships, the Hong Kong-Luzon route, and the Changxing Company's Asian Queen were able to enter the new customs wharf at 10:30 AM this morning. The Dollar Steamship Line's President Hoover was also able to arrive at buoys 11 and 12 at 8:00 AM this morning.</p>

<p>The Temporary Commercial Center Will Be Open for Business Starting Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai North Domestic Products Movement Exhibition, organized by the China National Goods Association, has been actively preparing since the site was determined to be an open space at the intersection of Hengfeng Road and Hanzhong Road in Zhabei, and the venues were built. The opening ceremony was held yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony The association held the opening ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Gezhi Primary School on Changan Road as the auditorium. Zhu Yangwu, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Binyan, a representative of Wu Jiangdong, and dozens of representatives from various factories attended the ceremony. Wang Binyan, a representative, raised the flag, and Zhu Yangwu unveiled the curtain. A small team of members from the Zhabei Security Regiment was specially stationed in the venue to provide protection, and the fire department in the area also dispatched a fire truck to be stationed at the venue to prevent emergencies.</p>
<p>Commercial Center Postponed The association's venue was originally scheduled to be completed and opened on the 12th. However, due to the rain and muddy roads, work was delayed, so the opening ceremony was postponed until yesterday. However, the venue was unusually humid, and the participating factories found it difficult to set up their displays. Therefore, the temporary commercial center will open for business at 2:00 PM this afternoon and will welcome visitors from all walks of life to visit and commemorate the event.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Taixing Rice Shop and Xinji Hat Shop Announced Closure Yesterday Morning <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Business Losses and Difficulties in Collecting Accounts; Lawyers Have Been Engaged to Conduct Liquidation</p>
<p>Amid the economic recession in Shanghai, two major stores, Taixing Rice Shop and Xinji Hat Shop, announced their closure and liquidation yesterday morning due to business losses.</p>
<p>The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Taixing Rice Shop Taixing Rice Shop was located on Touba Road in Hongkou, and its manager was Xi Zhengqing. It had been in the rice industry for quite some time, more than 50 years. Its business was usually good, but after one or two wars, it was difficult to collect accounts in Zhabei, resulting in significant losses. It had been struggling to continue until now, but it was unable to continue. Therefore, it closed down this morning and engaged lawyers Wu Kaisheng and accountant Lu Xiehua to represent the liquidation. Its announcement stated, "We have been informed by Xi Zhenqing, the manager of Taixing Rice Shop, that due to the impact of the economic recession, our store has suffered business losses, and our financial situation is not working, making it impossible to maintain operations. We have decided to announce liquidation in order to close down. We have specially appointed your firm of lawyers and accountants to publish an announcement, requesting all creditors to bring their certificates to your firm for registration within 14 days in order to calculate the amount owed. Debtors are also requested to pay the full amount within the aforementioned period. If they fail to do so by the deadline, creditors will be deemed to have voluntarily abandoned their rights, and debtors will be prosecuted according to the law." It is reported that the amount owed by and to the store is more than 100,000.</p>
<p>Xinji Hat Shop Xinji Hat Shop, established by Kang Qiren in the Public Concession of Shanghai, usually had good business. However, recently, due to competition from other stores and the economic recession, its business plummeted, and it was difficult to collect outstanding accounts. It was unable to continue operating and closed down yesterday. The store engaged lawyer Zhang Deyou to represent the liquidation. Its announcement stated, "We have been informed by Kang Qiren, the owner of Xinji Hat Shop, that the store is unable to maintain operations due to the economic downturn. We have decided to announce the closure and have specially appointed your firm of lawyers to conduct the liquidation. All those who are owed money are requested to bring their debt certificates to the firm for registration within seven days. Those who owe money are also requested to pay the full amount within the aforementioned period. If they fail to do so by the deadline, they will be prosecuted according to the law."</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Rescue Beggars Association Announces Postponement of Admission of Women and Children <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Quotas of Various Shelters are Full; Aftercare Measures Will Be Discussed in the Coming Days</p>
<p>The Rescue Beggars Association, attached to the Chinese Women's Temperance Union at No. 3 Waibaidu Bridge, Fude Road, Shanghai, originally planned to start admitting women and children beggars at 2:00 PM yesterday. The registration office, changing room, and bathhouse had also been prepared early. Xie Fengbao, Xia Hengbin, Zhang Shilin, and other staff members had also arrived. The reception room was full of beggar children and beggar women, and they were preparing to carry out the registration procedures when Ms. Liu Wang Liming suddenly arrived and announced a postponement of the admission. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Reasons for Postponement) Previously, the association had made arrangements with the Zhou Bihan Shelter, the Futong Shelter, the Xin Puyu Hall, and the Women and Children's Training Institute to accommodate beggar women, beggar children, and the like. It had also obtained the consent and cooperation of the relevant authorities of these halls and various charitable organizations in Shanghai. Ms. Liu Wang Liming of the association knew that the admission would not be a problem in general, so when she was running around to various parties a few days ago, she only worked hard to request donations of clothing and did not think about the admission location. Unexpectedly, this morning, all the shelters suddenly sent telegrams saying that the quotas were full, making the matter difficult to handle.</p>
<p>(Aftercare Measures) Regarding aftercare measures, the association plans to convene a joint meeting of various charitable organizations in the coming days to discuss and decide on the matter. The Rescue Beggars Association hopes to find an admission location and start accepting people within a week, considering the suffering of those who are thinly clothed and hungry in the winter. At the same time, the amount of donated clothing is too small and may not be sufficient for use, so it is necessary to seek donations from all parties again.</p>
<p>(The Situation of the Beggars) Yesterday, there were 16 or 17 beggars waiting to be admitted to the association inside the association's gate, including beggar women, beggar children, beggar boys, and beggar elders. They all sat silently with their hands in their sleeves and tears flowing down their faces. Among them, there were four or five beggars who had been waiting since 8:00 AM and had not left until the afternoon. Upon hearing about the postponement of admission, they either cried and called for help, or raised their hands to wipe away tears, or trembled and could not get up. Their condition was very tragic.</p>
<p>(Issuance of Copper Coins) After the association announced the postponement of admission, the beggars were unwilling to leave for a while. Later, the association issued copper coins, 15 coins to each beggar, and advised them to come to the association next week, and then they dispersed.</p>
<p>(Registration Time) The registration time was originally scheduled to be from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day. However, because the association is borrowing a church, there are various difficulties and inconveniences in practice. Therefore, the registration time has been changed to 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e133">What is the Purpose of Robbing a Car? <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Forcing the Driver Out of the Car with Box Cannons; Rented at Dawn and Discovered at Noon</p>
<p>The Dongxin Automobile Company at No. 299 Dongxin Bridge Entrance, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, was suddenly visited by two customers at 6:45 AM yesterday. One was wearing a blue cotton robe and the other was dressed as a mechanic, both around 20 years old. They walked to the company's accounting room and claimed that they wanted to rent a car to inspect a plot of land at No. 29 Hujiazhai, west of the New Longhua Huiling Middle School. They stated that the round-trip rental price was 4 yuan and the driver's tip was 5 jiao. The accountant immediately assigned the taxi to the driver Yin Xiaosheng (24 years old, from Changzhou), with license number 12240 for the French Concession and 4286 for the Chinese territory. The two customers immediately got into the car and drove straight south. When the car reached the halfway point, one of the customers instructed the driver to first drive the car to Nanyang Bridge to pick up a guest. When they arrived there, three more male guests got into the car. At this time, there were six people in the car, including the driver. Yin accelerated and headed towards Longhua. When they reached Xielu on Zhongshan Road, one of them suddenly ordered the car to stop. The one dressed as a mechanic and two others jumped out of the car, took out box cannons, and forced the driver out of the car. Two of them grabbed Yin's arms and moved him forward into the field. The one with the gun followed closely to monitor and prevent him from looking back. At the time, Yin had no choice but to obey. He heard the engine start and expected the car to be driven away. After walking about half a li, the two who were holding Yin released him and retreated, telling him not to look back. After another quarter of an hour, Yin looked back and all three of them were gone. Yin was slightly calmer at this time and rushed to the nearby Xujiahui Public Security Bureau to report the incident. Soon after, all the police stations in the Public Concession and the French Concession received the report. It was not until around noon that the car was found south of the Cade Theatre on Cade Road. As for the purpose of robbing the car, it is currently under investigation.</p>

<p>Bao Detective Stabbed, Six Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, Chinese detectives Su'ercai and Hang Bingquan from the French Concession received a confidential tip stating that someone was secretly manufacturing counterfeit silver coins made of copper and lead at No. 30, Lane 372, Xujiahui Road, east of Dapu Bridge, within the concession. They were requested to make an immediate arrest. Upon receiving the report, the detectives immediately sought instructions from the Chief Detective, who promptly dispatched Western Detective Chiberski to accompany Su and Hang to the address. Unexpectedly, upon entering the premises, as Detective Su was leading the way up the stairs, someone suddenly appeared at the top of the stairs wielding an iron awl, aiming directly at Detective Su's head. Fortunately, the Western Detective had sharp eyes and quick hands and rushed forward, striking the assailant in the chest with a palm strike. The assailant lost his footing and fell. At this moment, all the detectives rushed forward, subdued him, and seized the iron awl. The final search resulted in the arrest of six individuals. The first, who wielded the awl, was named Lin Zhao (25 years old, from Fujian). The others were Chen Chuncheng (25 years old, from Wenzhou), Huang Puwen (58 years old, from Wenzhou), Lin Jian'an (37 years old, from Wenzhou), Mei Yunguang (38 years old, from Pingyang), and Wei Shun (26 years old, from Fujian). Over two hundred yuan of finished counterfeit coins and over one hundred yuan of unfinished ones were confiscated from the attic, along with dozens of manufacturing machines. All were taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the Chief Detective, he ordered them to be detained separately, pending transfer to the Second Special Court for further investigation.</p>

<p>Perpetrated at Least Six Cases - Zhou Taibing is a True Scourge of Society</p>
<p>Zhou Taibing, from Zhenjiang, is twenty-two years old this year and resides at No. 19 Yangzhou Road in the Public Concession. On the afternoon of July 13th of last year at 3:00 PM, he went to Quan Tai, a wool, flannel, silk, and foreign goods store at No. 362 Avenue Edward VII, to purchase goods. The shop assistant, Shen Jisheng, attended to the transaction. Zhou immediately selected various clothing materials, totaling seventy-nine yuan and fifty cents. After cutting and wrapping them, he instructed Shen to issue an invoice for payment. As Shen turned to prepare the invoice at the accounts desk, Zhou seized the opportunity to take out a hand grenade from his pocket and hold it in his hand. He also produced a letter signed "Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps" and placed it on the counter, loudly declaring to the shop assistants, "I'm going to throw a grenade, quickly get away!" Upon seeing Zhou produce the grenade and witnessing his intention to throw it, the shop assistants naturally fled in panic. Zhou then grabbed the package of purchased clothing materials and fled. Later, Yu Ruilin, the manager of the store, filed a report with the French Concession Police, requesting an investigation, but without success. It is understood that Zhou subsequently habitually impersonated the "Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps," writing threatening letters and, in the same manner, defrauding clothing materials and goods from various foreign goods stores in the Public Concession. He would first trick them into cutting materials and goods, then produce a grenade and threatening letter, grabbing the goods and fleeing. He committed the same crime in at least six cases. After the stores reported to the police, requesting an investigation, Zhou was finally apprehended by the Public Concession Police. A hand grenade was confiscated and he was sent to the First Special Court for prosecution and trial. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. After investigation by the French Concession Police, a request was submitted to the Second Special Court to dispatch detectives Li Jinzhang and Xu Songlin to transfer Zhou, along with the hand grenade, from the First Special Court to the Second Special Court, Criminal Division One. Presiding Judge Xiong Huitui conducted the hearing. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, requesting a postponement to allow for a detailed investigation into whether the defendant had committed other crimes, and then proceed with the trial. Yu Ruilin, the manager of the plaintiff, Quan Tai, testified about the defendant's fraudulent acquisition of goods, intimidation, and fleeing with the goods. Zhou Taibing confessed that he had served as a volunteer soldier during the January 28th Incident and that he had brought back the hand grenade upon discharge. He claimed that it had been submerged in water and was not explosive. He also admitted to falsely claiming to be the "Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps" to intimidate and defraud goods without denial. The court verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for another hearing on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Chen Xinzhang's Wife Injured in Leg by Robbers - Two Robbers Also Apprehended</p>
<p>Chen Xinzhang, a steamer employee of the Minsheng Steamer Company under Jardine Matheson, lives with his wife, Zhang, at No. 40, Ronghua Lane, Xinjihang Road, Hongkou. Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, after Chen had finished lunch with his wife and elder sister, He Chen, while chatting at home, four robbers suddenly arrived, each wielding a handgun. They shouted at everyone in the house to remain still and not move. Seeing that Chen's elder sister, He Chen, had two gemstone rings on her hand, they first seized those. They then forced Chen and others to hand over their valuables. However, Chen was not a weakling and resisted the robbers. Two men wrestled with each other. Seeing that their accomplice was losing ground, the robbers shouted from the side to fire a shot. At that moment, Chen's wife, Zhang, fearing that her husband would suffer an accident, cried out for help, shouting "Catch the robbers!" The robbers, desperate, drew their guns and fired a shot at Zhang's leg. She was immediately injured and fell to the ground. Knowing that things had gone wrong, the robbers fled, running out the door. Seeing the robbers escape, Chen pursued them, blowing a whistle frantically. At that moment, a Chinese police officer No. 117 from the Huishan Police Station happened to be shopping nearby. Upon hearing the whistle, he saw a man running out of the lane with a gun and knew that he was no good. He bravely stepped forward, subdued him, and seized a handgun. Simultaneously, Chinese police officers No. 1691 and No. 915 from the third patrol route of the Huishan Police Station also happened to be patrolling the area. They helped to apprehend another robber. They, along with the handgun, were taken into custody and held at the police station, pending transfer to the court this morning for further investigation. Meanwhile, the police chief dispatched detectives to the scene for inspection and had Zhang taken to the hospital for treatment. As the injury was not critical, she is expected to recover.</p>

<p>Multiple Arrests Made in One Day</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police authorities, noting the recent surge in robberies within the concession and the arrival of the critical winter defense period, have issued orders to all police stations to assign experienced detectives to patrol day and night in shifts. Yesterday, various police stations successively arrested multiple armed robbers attempting to commit robbery. The details are as follows: (1) At 7:15 AM on October 20th of last year, several armed robbers suddenly broke into the Wan Da Xiang Money Exchange at No. 660 Jiujiang Road. They wielded handguns, forbidding any outcry. They first cut the telephone line and drove the shop assistants into a corner, keeping them under strict surveillance. They immediately began searching and looting. Fortunately, it was early morning and the money exchange had not yet started trading, so they only managed to steal silver dollars worth 217 yuan. As they were leaving, one of the robbers made a show of force by taking a bullet out of his handgun and handing it over, indicating that the gun was not a fake, and then they left with the money. Only yesterday were the robbers in this case, Zhou Zhengde and Qian Chengchun, both from Suzhou, apprehended by French Concession detectives. A handgun and five bullets were confiscated. Since the scene of the incident was in the Public Concession, the responsible Laozha Police Station was notified to dispatch detective Lang Jintang to bring Zhou and Qian, along with the handgun and bullets, back to the police station. The victim identified the handgun as the one used during the robbery and ordered them to be taken into custody. (2) Chief Detective Su Changsheng and detective Wu Chunrong from the General Police Station apprehended robbers Ye Jinchun and Qiu Yousheng at the intersection of Hart Road and Edinburgh Road yesterday afternoon. A handgun and eight bullets were confiscated from Ye. They were taken back to the police station and taken into custody. (3) Chief Detective Zhu Mengwei and detective Zhang Liang from the Gordon Road Police Station apprehended robbers Shen Xiaosanzi (also known as Xiao Sizi or Shen Xiaohai) and Peng Zhiqing (also known as Peng A Yi), both from Jiangbei, at Connaught Road last night at 9:30 PM. A handgun and seven bullets were confiscated. They were taken into custody at the police station. (4) Detective Shen Deyao from the Huisi Police Station apprehended robbers Wu Jinrong from Suzhou, Cai Baosheng from Nanjing, and Mao Xiaosan from Xuzhou at No. 33 Jinlong Street, Henan Road, yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM. A handgun and six bullets were confiscated from Wu. They were taken into custody. The police stations successively transferred the arrested robbers to the First Special District Court. Lawyers Wang Yaotang and Zhang Tianyin from the police station filed lawsuits separately. Citing the limited time, the police station had not yet conducted a detailed investigation of each suspect and requested a postponement. Judges Feng Shide and Liu Yugui approved the postponement and ordered all defendants to be remanded to the police station.</p>

<p>Foaming at the Mouth, Loses All Consciousness - Examination Confirms Death from Heart Disease</p>
<p>Xu Hongsheng, a native of Nantong, aged fifty-four, residing in a flat at No. 10 Zhangjiazhai, located between Edinburgh Road and Carter Road in the Public Concession, currently works as a waiter at a Western restaurant at No. 1958 Avenue Joffre and Route Ferguson in the French Concession. Xie Jinsong, a twenty-two-year-old native of Ningbo, residing at No. 14 Meiren Lane, Rue Pére Robert, is a colleague of Xu. Recently, Xie returned to his hometown to get married and sent a gift. After completing his wedding, Xie returned to Shanghai and hosted a return banquet on the evening of the 12th of this month at the Shenghongtai Restaurant on Zhejiang Road and Great World. Xu was also invited to the banquet. At 11:30 PM, the banquet ended. Xu was already drunk. After leaving Shenghongtai Restaurant, Xu took a tram on Nanjing Road to Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai. He then hired a rickshaw pulled by Zhang Haichuan, a native of Taizhou, intending to return to his employer's home to sleep. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Ferguson, Xu, sitting in the rickshaw, became unconscious, foaming at the mouth, and lost all awareness. He could not identify the direction to go home. Helpless, the rickshaw puller pulled him to the intersection of Rue Remi. French Police Officer No. 39 and Chinese Police Officer No. 80, who were patrolling, found him and ordered the rickshaw puller to take him to the Rue Pére Robert Police Station, intending to send him to the hospital for treatment. However, when they arrived at the entrance of the police station, Xu died. The body was then taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary for examination. Detectives found a restaurant bill for the banquet on the deceased and, after some inquiries, obtained the address of his family. His wife, Xu Gu, was notified to identify the body. Yesterday, Judge Wang Ren was dispatched by the Second Special Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor and clerk, to the mortuary at noon to examine the body. It was confirmed that the deceased had died from heart disease. The judge ordered the family to sign a guarantee before claiming the body for burial.</p>

<p>Fellow Guild Members Offer Assistance - Sent to Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>According to a notice issued yesterday by the Fruit Industry Dock Workers Guild, Tang Ayuan, a native of Zhenhai, Ningbo, aged forty-five, has been working as a dock worker at the Liang Dongshenglong Fruit Store at the intersection of Dongmen Road and Lima Road on the Bund for many years. He has been diligent and honest and supports his family of five with his work. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month at 5:00 PM, he and Zhang Linsheng were carrying two buckets of Fuzhou oranges, each weighing two hundred and ten catties, to the fruit pier on the Bund. When they reached the back door of the Lumingshai Clock and Watch Shop in Baochang Lane, due to the continuous rainy days, the road was muddy and slippery. He lost his footing and fell, and his left leg was crushed by the weight of the oranges, causing it to break. His colleagues requested Xu Yunqing, the manager of the store, to issue a guarantee so that he could be treated at the hospital. However, the manager refused. Tang Ayuan, who only earned a meager income from his hard work, was barely able to support his family and had no savings. Now that he had suffered an unexpected accident, he was not only unable to afford treatment but also had difficulty making a living. He immediately reported to the Fruit Industry Dock Workers Guild, requesting assistance. The guild approved an allocation for assistance. Additionally, Rong Baokang, Hong Dexing, Wang Zhao Jin, and others, who were in the preparatory committee of the Fruit Industry Dock Workers Guild, launched a fundraising campaign among the members. The members, recognizing the spirit of mutual aid and cooperation, generously provided assistance. Fruit merchant Sun Shenzhong and others also provided financial assistance. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Police Detect and Crack the Case - All Involved Are Detained</p>
<p>Ruan Mugen and his wife, Xu Yin, natives of Liyang, due to poverty and famine in their hometown, brought three daughters to Shanghai. At No. 45 Tongchang Lane, Haining Road, they entrusted Che Yongkang, a native of Yangzhou, his concubine, Guo, and a Guangdong woman, Chen Agu, to sell Ruan Mugen's six-year-old sister and brother, Xu Yin's twelve-year-old daughter Jin Di, and eight-year-old daughter Yi Di, to Yue women Ma Ergu at No. 32 in the neighborhood, Wu Zhang at No. 373, and Li Jinmei at No. 365 Qiujiang Road in Zhabei. The prices were agreed upon and contracts were drafted, with an initial deposit of twenty yuan. Just as the transaction was about to proceed, Chinese detective Xu Chengyuan and detectives Zhang Yunsheng and Chen Dabao from the Hongkou Police Station discovered the situation. They reported to the police chief and, at approximately 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, they, along with a Western detective, secretly went to the address. They arrested the five men and women, including Ruan and his wife. A twelve-year-old Liyang girl, Yin Xiaoyatou, was also found in the house, brought to Shanghai by her father, Yin Changsheng, from the countryside. She was staying there to be sold. The locations of the sales of Ruan Tongdi, Xu Jin Di, and Xu Yi Di were inquired. They were taken to the places and found. Along with the sales contracts and other items, they were all taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan from the Public Works Department presented the case and requested a postponement. The evidence was presented for inspection. Then, Chinese and Western detectives reported the process of solving the case.

<p>Family Dispute of Trauma Specialist Min Caichen</p>
<p>Min Caichen, a renowned trauma specialist from Kunshan residing in Shanghai, has been practicing for many years at his clinic located at No. 11 Yongnian Lane, Baker Road, in the Public Concession. His medical practice is thriving and he has accumulated considerable wealth. His son, Min Shuliu, followed in his father's footsteps and established his clinic at No. 5 Houzai Lane, opposite his father's clinic. Shuliu, in September of the eighth year of the Republic of China, with the introduction of Zhou Guantao and Xu Qiaosheng, took Wang Fengzhu, a Kunshan woman, as his concubine. At that time, Wang was only sixteen years old. She initially lived with Shuliu in Kunshan and then moved to Shanghai. For the past ten years, their relationship has been harmonious and intimate. They had a daughter named Rongfang, who is now thirteen years old and attending a certain school. Unexpectedly, Shuliu suddenly fell ill in June of this year and died, leaving behind his beautiful concubine and orphaned daughter. At this time, his father, Min Caichen, forced Min Wang Fengzhu and her daughter to sever their family ties and announced that their living expenses would be cut off. Since her husband's death, the mother and daughter have had difficulty making a living and have been living on borrowed money. Recently, it has become even more difficult to sustain themselves. They retained lawyer Yao to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Min Caichen of violating Article 310 of the Criminal Code for abandonment, and also filed a civil suit, requesting that he be ordered to pay the mother and daughter a lump sum of 44,120 yuan for living expenses. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Judge Ye Shengchao of the Second Criminal Court summoned the parties for a hearing. The defendant, Min Caichen, failed to appear and no lawyer appeared on his behalf. The plaintiff's attorney, lawyer Yao, stated that the plaintiff, Min Wang Fengzhu, is thirty-two years old, a native of Kunshan, and resides at No. 5 Houzai Lane, Baker Road. The second plaintiff, Min Rongfang, is Wang Fengzhu's daughter, currently thirteen years old. Wang Fengzhu could not attend the hearing today due to illness. Lawyer Yao then presented the main points of the lawsuit, stating that after the death of the plaintiff's husband, Min Shuliu, she was forced by the defendant to sever family ties. Currently, the plaintiff is suffering from pneumonia and needs money for medical expenses and her daughter's education. The defendant, who possesses a considerable ancestral fortune, refuses to provide support and has committed abandonment, violating Article 310 of the Criminal Code. He should be prosecuted and punished accordingly. He also filed a civil suit, requesting that the court order the payment of at least 120 yuan per month for living expenses, medical expenses, and other expenses, calculated until she reaches the age of sixty, totaling 40,520 yuan. Additionally, 3,800 yuan is needed for the daughter Rongfang's education in middle school and university, totaling 44,100 yuan. Due to the current financial difficulties and accumulating debts, he requested that the court first order the payment of 800 yuan and declare provisional execution. Judge Ye verified the statement and, since the defendant had not appeared, ordered that the case be postponed for seven days and that Min Caichen be summoned to appear for another hearing.</p>

<p>Jing Yun Sues Ma Shanda - Both Sides Offer Conflicting Accounts</p>
<p>Ma Shanda, the grandson of the late renowned throat specialist Ma Fengbo, is a native of Jiangwan and is twenty-two years old. (He is the adopted son of Dr. Ma Wanyao.) He resides at No. 902 Haining Road and graduated from the Shanghai National Medical College. He is currently practicing medicine at Avenue Edinburgh. He is now being sued for seduction by Jing Yun (twenty-two years old), a female doctor from Shaoxing residing at No. 18, Lane 489, Route Paul Beau in the French Concession. She has retained lawyer Zhu Chengxun to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The main points of her complaint are as follows: The plaintiff and Ma Shanda were classmates at the Shanghai National Medical College and were in the same class. Therefore, they became acquainted and exchanged ideas on academic matters. During their spare time, the defendant often invited the plaintiff to visit parks, falsely claiming that his household was still empty and that he wished to establish a lifelong partnership. The plaintiff did not agree. After graduating in the twenty-first year of the Republic, the plaintiff returned to Shaoxing. This spring, she came to Shanghai again to intern at a hospital. The defendant learned of this and often came to visit, showing great enthusiasm and reiterating his previous proposal, hoping to marry soon. Later, the plaintiff visited the defendant at his clinic. Unexpectedly, he wrote a marriage agreement in his own handwriting on a prescription slip and gave it to the plaintiff to keep. This year (the twenty-third year), in July, he again lured her to a hotel and exchanged diamond rings to gain her trust. On July 22nd, he lured her to room 426 of the East Asia Hotel and, with sweet words, told the plaintiff that since they would be husband and wife sooner or later, they should choose an auspicious date for the wedding. The plaintiff, unaware, lost her virginity. However, since things had already happened and could not be undone, she could only urge him to choose a date for the wedding. Unexpectedly, the defendant, having achieved his goal, ignored her. This behavior constitutes a crime under Article 244 of the Criminal Code. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Ye Shengchao of the First Special Court in the Second Criminal Court. Ma Shanda appeared in court as summoned. The plaintiff, Jing Yun, did not appear due to illness. Lawyer Zhu explained the above circumstances and presented a marriage agreement to the court. When questioned, Ma Shanda stated that he was a classmate of the plaintiff and that they had occasionally discussed academic matters. He admitted that he had booked the East Asia Hotel room, but only for a mahjong game with friends and not for any improper behavior with the plaintiff. As for the marriage agreement presented by the plaintiff, it was indeed written in his own handwriting, but there was a reason. One day, the plaintiff invited him to dinner at the Yijia Chun Restaurant. He accepted the invitation. As soon as he sat down, a person resembling a hooligan, Ren Xiao Kai, came and said that the plaintiff was already married and should not be sitting with him. He had to write a statement, or else there were people waiting for him outside. He was forced to write the statement. He later filed a report with the court for record-keeping. Recently, he received a threatening letter. Therefore, this matter was blackmail. He then presented a copy of the record-keeping report and the threatening letter to the court. Judge Ye verified the statement and ordered the case to be postponed for one week and that the plaintiff should appear in court next time for cross-examination.</p>

<p>Implementation to Begin This Year</p>
<p>The coloring of tea leaves should be prohibited. However, due to continued demand in foreign markets, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, after considering the situation, approved temporary exports. While colored tea had not yet been completely banned, efforts were made to ensure that the colorants were pure and non-toxic, so as not to affect hygiene. Experts also researched various yellow colorants for manufacturing and sale, which were widely used. The bureau recently discovered that some colored tea leaves for export were still dyed with lead-based chrome and other yellow powders, which not only harmed human health but also potentially affected international trade and hindered sales. A notice was issued to tea merchants stating that from this year onwards, all new tea for export that required coloring should use non-toxic alternatives. The use of copper-based chrome and other toxic colorants will be strictly prohibited. Tea merchants are cautioned not to attempt to use them.</p>

<p>The Zhabei Charity Group’s Liuying Road Congee Kitchen began distributing congee on January 1st of this year. However, due to the large number of impoverished people flocking to the kitchen for congee, causing disorder and overcrowding, the distribution was temporarily suspended on the 5th. Meanwhile, an additional shed was built to the east of the old kitchen, which could accommodate seven or eight thousand more people. Two philanthropists, Cha and Xiao, from the Yishan Society, inspected the situation at the kitchen and generously donated five hundred loads of rice. They also invited Wang Maoqing to reside at the kitchen to oversee the distribution. Consequently, the distribution was reopened on the 14th. The impoverished people are happy to have a full stomach again.</p>

<p>Flesh and Bones Rotting, Horrific to Behold - Head Not Yet Found, Still Awaiting Excavation</p>
<p>Gong Shaoting, the owner of the Gong Hongtai Construction Factory at the Gongxing Road Bridge Pier on Baoxing Road in Zhabei, colluded with his mistress, a local woman named Hou, on the evening of March 12th of last year to lure his former mistress, Gu Aqiao, to Hou's residence on the upper floor of No. 37 Shun Da Lane, Keming Road. There, they strangled Gu Aqiao to death with a rope. Afterwards, they buried Aqiao's body in the third courtyard of the Gong Hongtai Construction Factory on Baoxing Road. Later, Gong Shaoting, Hou, and Gong's son-in-law, Shen Fufu, felt that this was inappropriate. In early May of last year, they instructed a worker, Zhou Baoquan, to enlist the help of Li Baosheng and Gui Sheng. At night, they dug up Aqiao's body, chopped it into three pieces with an axe - the head, torso, and waist. They packed the pieces into sacks, sealed them tightly with lime, and placed them in baskets. They moved the head and buried it in an open space in front of the Zhu Jiazhai residence. The torso and waist were buried under the back door of the third room of the newly built flat, intending to make everything foolproof and carefree. However, the net of heaven is vast, with meshes large but letting nothing through. Xie Baolin, the nephew of the deceased, who lived at No. 5 Dingfeng Lane, Ba Xianqiao in the French Concession, noticed something amiss. He reported the matter to Lu Ying, the captain of the Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting him to send officers to investigate thoroughly. Upon receiving the report, Captain Lu instructed squad leaders Zhou Peichuan and Chen Guangyan to lead detectives to search in different directions. The truth was revealed, and the masterminds Gong Shaoting, Hou, and the murderers Zhou Baoquan and Li Baosheng were arrested one after another. After separate rigorous interrogations, each confessed without hesitation. They were sent to the Third Section for transfer to the local court for handling. It was reported previously. It is now learned that after the case was transferred to the local court, the court dispatched prosecutor Lei and forensic doctor Zhao Huachu, along with court police Xu Guoguang and Shen Tingfang, and Investigation Team squad leaders Zhou and Chen from the Public Security Bureau, accompanied by detectives Lu Zhenyuan and others, and the local headman Yan Liugen. They brought the accomplice Zhou Baoquan to the Gong Hongtai Construction Factory at No. 933 West Baoxing Road in Zhabei at approximately 11:00 AM yesterday, traveling by car. At 12:30 PM, the police officers, along with the police chief of the Bazihqiao Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, supervised the excavation of the earth at the back door of the third courtyard. At approximately 2:00 PM, after digging to a depth of five to six feet, the deceased's blue leather jacket and linen bag with arms were discovered. By 4:30 PM, the body had been completely exhumed. The flesh and bones were already rotting, making it horrific to behold. A telephone call was made to prosecutor Lei, who arrived at the scene to inspect. However, the head had been abandoned elsewhere in a public cemetery and its whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, prosecutor Lei sealed the body and ordered the headman to guard it. He also ordered squad leaders Zhou Peishan and Yang Guangyan to continue investigating the whereabouts of the head. It is heard that Gong Shaoting, Hou, Zhou Baoquan, and others, who are in custody at the court, will be temporarily returned to the Public Security Bureau for detention in order to facilitate the search for the head.</p>

<p>Shiye She reports: Zheng Jianbo, former Commander-in-Chief of the Volunteer Army Transportation Corps of the four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, recently gathered more than 30 patriotic comrades in Shanghai and organized the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Consumption Association on the third floor of Taichangfangzi on Zhejiang Road. The aim is to set an example by using national goods, and to persuade all households, shops, schools, factories, etc., in the city to use national products as much as possible to recover rights and interests. No membership fees will be charged. The association yesterday submitted a request to the City Party Headquarters for filing. The original text states, "Regarding the organization of the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Consumption Association, we earnestly request approval for filing. Jianbo and others, recognizing the decline of industry and the stagnation of national goods, believe that all of us citizens should shoulder the responsibility of actively promoting national goods. Since</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>the opening of the five treaty ports, foreigners have been dumping foreign goods without end. The outflow of money is incalculable, leading to economic bankruptcy and the impoverishment of the people. The leak is not stopped, and recovery is impossible. Although there have been calls to promote national goods over the years, they have risen and fallen like the wind, but they are empty in name and lack practicality. Furthermore, there are still very few consumers, making it difficult to achieve results. Therefore, Jianbo and others gathered more than 30 comrades to initiate the organization of the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Consumption Association, specifically to persuade all households, shops, schools, factories, etc., in the city to earnestly use national goods. The aim is to make all residents of the city realize that using national goods is an urgent and necessary measure, so that foreign goods will naturally be eliminated, the leak can be stopped, and the country can become rich and the people strong, all through this action. For this reason, we have prepared a document and attached a draft of the association's constitution and declaration on using national goods, and submit it to your department for review. We earnestly request approval for filing, as it is in the public interest."</p>

<h3 id="e151">The Western Clothing Industry Guild Requests the Issuance of New Soft Rulers <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Exemption from punishment if the new ruler is not issued.</p>
<p>The Western Clothing Industry Guild suggested to the authorities: "Regarding the request to consult the Bureau of Weights and Measures and expedite the issuance of new soft rulers for application and business purposes. It has been found that members of our guild use soft rulers to tailor Western clothing. Although the implementation of the new system of weights and measures has been in place for many years, soft rulers have not been sold on the market. Therefore, members of our guild have had no choice but to continue using the old soft rulers to conduct business. This is because our industry of tailoring Western clothing must measure the body size closely, and bamboo rulers are useless. Soft rulers are indispensable. Recently, we have received reports from fellow traders along Zhonghua Road in Nanshi, such as Fulou Company, Zhonghua, and Guohua, that they have been searched by your bureau in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau for using soft rulers, and have been notified by the local court for compulsory enforcement and punishment. Although members of our guild want to comply with the new system of measuring instruments, they cannot be purchased in reality. If we do not urgently seek remedies, then the old ones cannot be used and the new ones have not yet been issued. During this transition period, the business prospects of our industry will suffer great losses. Therefore, we have prepared this document and request that your bureau, considering the circumstances, expedite the consultation with the Bureau of Weights and Measures to issue new soft rulers for application. Before the issuance of the soft rulers, the old soft rulers will be temporarily allowed to be used to maintain business. We also request the local court to withdraw the order and exempt Fulou, Zhonghua, Guohua, and other companies from the punishment for using soft rulers to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, which would be a great kindness." Respectfully presented by Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, and Wang Lianfang, Chairman of the Shanghai Western Clothing Industry Guild.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, on the 12th of this month, when the Shanghai Maru entered Nagasaki, a Japanese merchant named Imabayashi, who runs a business on Peng Road in Shanghai, illegally transported a large number of precious stones to Japan. When the ship docked and was being quarantined, a third-class passenger, who looked dignified and like a gentleman, was seen by the customs officers disembarking for inspection, hastily trying to escape. He was seen by the dock manager, who suspected his behavior and ordered an inspection. A white gold-encrusted gem ring, two cat's eye rings, brooches, and other valuables worth several thousand yuan were found on him. He claimed, "I live at No. 160 Peng Road in Shanghai, named Imabayashi Matsutaro. These valuables were brought here at the request of others and are not my own. Therefore, I did not want to hide them in my shoes like others and secretly conceal them." After investigation by the authorities, it was determined that he was a habitual offender of smuggling and was taken into custody.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Chen Huazhang is Accused of Assaulting and Insulting Court Bailiffs <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Chen Huazhang, a local resident living at No. 4 Raul East Road in the French Concession, is sixty years old and runs Shun Shengji Construction Factory. He has been dealing with the Shanghai Bank for loans. Because he owed more than 2,000 foreign dollars, he refused to pay. The Shanghai Bank filed a complaint with the Second Special Court for mediation, but it was unsuccessful. The bank then formally filed a lawsuit, requesting an investigation. The court issued a summons according to the complaint and sent bailiff Wang Zushao to Chen's residence on Raul East Road to deliver the summons. Unexpectedly, Chen replied that no one lived here. Wang, who did not know Chen, had no choice but to return to the court disappointed. He reported the information to the presiding judge Ma Yishu. By the time the court session began, only the plaintiff, Yang Jiemei, the agent of the Shanghai Bank, was present. The official ordered the plaintiff to designate the person to report to the court for another interrogation. Until the afternoon of December 28th of last year, at 3:00 PM, a Mr. Zou from the Shanghai Bank, accompanied by bailiff Wang, went to designate the person. Unexpectedly, Chen not only refused to accept the summons, but also assaulted and slapped bailiff Wang's face twice. Wang again reported the information to the court, and the court, because the defendant Chen Huazhang intentionally refused to appear in court, ruled in absentia. He still ordered bailiff Wang Shaozu to deliver the judgment. Wang was afraid of being insulted again, so he accompanied the bailiff to deliver it. When they arrived, Chen was lying across the bed in the room, inhaling opium. When Chen saw the bailiff and bailiff delivering the judgment, Chen threw the judgment on the ground and instigated the male and female guests in the room to besiege them. The bailiff and bailiff reported to the police station by Wang's phone and sent detectives to arrest them. Chen had already escaped in the meantime. Wang Shaozu, because Chen was so unreasonable and insulted public officials, which was related to the authority of the court, reported the information to the prosecutor's office and sent bailiffs to summon him to the address. However, Chen still refused to appear. Therefore, the chief prosecutor signed an arrest warrant and brought Chen to court. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wang Ren and clerk Peng Yi specially opened the second court for interrogation. The defendant hired a lawyer to the court for discussion. First, the plaintiff Wang Shaozu said, "On the 28th of last month, I was ordered by Judge Ma to go to the defendant's home to deliver the summons. The defendant said that there was no Chen Huazhang and refused to accept the summons. The second time, the plaintiff sent someone to accompany me to designate the person. At that time, the defendant was lying on the bed and smoking opium, and spoke insults. The third time I went to deliver the summons, the defendant did not see me at first. When I walked out of the alley, the defendant chased up from behind and slapped me twice. The fourth time I went to deliver the judgment, I accompanied the 14th bailiff. The defendant threw the judgment on the ground and spoke insults. When I wanted to call the police station, the defendant took the opportunity to escape. Many female relatives made things difficult for us, and a man wearing a coat said that killing a person in the court was like killing a dog, and it would cost at most 300 yuan to settle it." Then, the defendant Chen Huazhang testified that he had been smoking opium due to illness, and denied insulting court personnel. But "Mr. Wang scolded me for being a fool. One night, it was already past 9:00, and he broke into my house. I don't know what he meant." After verifying the testimony, the court ruled that the case still needed to be investigated, so it was ordered to postpone the interrogation. The defendant was ordered to pay a cash bail of 1,000 yuan to be released pending further instructions. If no bail was provided, he would be detained. The defendant, upon hearing the order, immediately took out a large wad of banknotes, counted 1,000 yuan to pay for the bail, and left the court.</p>

<p>Xia Desheng, a local resident, is only nineteen years old. He does not think about studying and is willing to engage in depravity. He associates with a group of bandits. Recently, his father, Xia Yongxiang, published an announcement expelling him, declaring that he was severing the relationship between father and son. Last month, Xia Desheng and Liu Yunting were reported for extortion and were arrested by the local court. After questioning, it was confirmed that the two criminals, Xia Desheng and Liu Yunting, were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Now, Xia Desheng's wife, Ma Suzhu, hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng and filed for divorce in the mediation court of the local court. The reasons are abuse, abandonment, and neglect of alimony, and she also requests payment of 360 yuan in alimony. Yesterday, Judge Yao Fuxiang summoned Ma Suzhu and her lawyer Pan to court. Ma Suzhu testified that she was sixteen years old when she married Xia Desheng on January 10th, 22nd year of the Republic, through a matchmaker and under her mother's order. At first, she lived with her in-laws, but Xia Desheng was a romantic villain with no legitimate occupation. He wasted money outside and often pawned my clothes for expenses. If he was not satisfied, he would beat and abuse me. Afterwards, he apologized and wrote a handwritten note as proof. Later, Xia Desheng was expelled from the family for not listening to his parents. In the summer of this year, Xia Desheng took me to rent a house on Miller Road in Hongkou to live together, but he had no source of income for rent and other expenses. All my clothes were pawned. On the 13th day of the ninth lunar month, Xia Desheng said goodbye to the petitioner and left, saying, "I am really sorry for you. I am going to Nanjing to join the army. It is difficult to determine when I will return." He left a photo and twenty-three pawn tickets before leaving. At this point, I could only cry and wash my face with tears. I was alone and had no idea what to do. I had no choice but to pawn my dowry items, such as dressing tables and washstands, to take care of all the debts and live temporarily in my mother's house alone. I deeply regret meeting the wrong person and resent my whole life. I am also pregnant and cannot work to earn a living, which makes me feel even more difficult. Now I know that Xia Desheng was recently arrested for extortion with others and sentenced to imprisonment. Therefore, my hope for my husband is completely cut off." The judge ordered the detained Xia Desheng to be brought to court to testify. He said, "If she wants a divorce, I can't stop her. I can only let her be free. As for asking me to pay alimony, I am unable to afford it." The judge asked Ma Suzhu, who also voluntarily gave up the alimony. The judge considered that the conciliation was successful and drafted a conciliation record in court, ordering both parties to sign it and leave the court.</p>

<p>Hua Chuan Cai, from Jiangbei, lives at No. 298 Jiu'an Lane, Taiyangmiao Road, Zhabei. He used to run a Tongxingchang firewood shop there, and his life was still comfortable. Yesterday, Hua held a Tangbing feast at home to celebrate the full moon of his newborn son and had a grand banquet for his guests, which was very lively. Unexpectedly, this aroused the covetousness of bandits. At about 5:00 PM, more than a dozen bandits of different shapes and colors suddenly came. Five or six of them had pistols and threatened everyone not to move. At that time, the guests were shocked and speechless when they saw the sudden appearance of the robbers. They let the bandits search and plunder. After about half an hour, they left satisfied. Checking the losses, it was about 200 yuan. He immediately reported to the police station in charge and requested a pursuit, but a happy occasion was thus disintegrated, and everyone returned with their heads lowered and crestfallen.</p>

They had been married for more than a year and had a good relationship. However, Ding was frivolous by nature and quite beautiful, and there were many people who coveted her. Recently, Chen Xinfa returned home from Pinghu. In the evening, because he was thirsty, he ordered his wife Ding to boil water for him to drink. Unexpectedly, after drinking it, his complexion changed drastically, and he suddenly died with a purplish body. Chen Xinfa's older sister, Zhang Chen, reported the information to the police station in charge, who ordered the local guarantor to ask the local court to send someone to verify that Chen Xinfa had died from poison. It was ordered to put the coffin in storage for further investigation, as has been reported previously. It is now known that after this case occurred, the police station in charge paid special attention to it and secretly investigated it. It was learned that Zhang Wusheng had been having an affair with Chen Ding for a long time and was not unrelated to this case. Therefore, Zhang was arrested and interrogated. It was also found that Zhang Baolin also had a physical relationship with Ding. Therefore, Zhang Baolin was also arrested and interrogated.

He married Shen, who is now 25 years old and pregnant at full term. She suddenly gave birth a few days ago and hired midwife He to deliver the baby. Because the weather was cold, she burned a charcoal stove for warming. Unexpectedly, the house was short and narrow, with no doors or windows, and the stove was very hot, causing poisoning. At that time, Chen's sister happened to enter the room to shop and saw her sister-in-law lying stiffly on the bed, the midwife fainted and fell to the ground, and the baby was also suffocated and silent. She felt the coal gas choking her and was unbearably suffocated, so she shouted for help. Neighbors gathered. At that time, Lianzhi happened to return home from work and saw the situation. For a moment, he did not know what to do. Fortunately, a neighbor immediately went to the Hongkou Public Obstetrics Clinic at the intersection of Huade Road and hired doctors Wang Ying and Xu Cuizhen to rush to the rescue. Fortunately, the poisoning was still mild, and the pregnant woman and the midwife woke up one after another.

<h3 id="e173">Qinghai Education Department Requests Commendation for Ma Bufang's Establishment of Education for All Ethnic Groups <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently received a report from Yang Xirao, the Director of the Qinghai Provincial Education Department, stating that Qinghai is located in a remote border area with backward culture and that educational facilities face many difficulties. Since the establishment of the province, Chairman Ma has relied on his great strategy and planning to vigorously promote education for all ethnic groups, including Mongol, Tibetan, Hui, and Han, in order to consolidate the foundation of border defense. However, due to recent droughts and floods, uneven distribution of water and frequent hailstorms, people's livelihoods are exhausted, causing farmers and merchants to suffer, and the province's finances are stagnant. The current situation is difficult to maintain, and all matters that should be developed have not been carried out in order. In recent years, the central government has paid attention to the Northwest and implemented development. Party and government officials have visited Qinghai many times to investigate, and they all believe that cultural backwardness is a major shortcoming of Qinghai Province. Therefore, Ma Bufang, the commander of the Second Army of the Central Army and the commander of the Hainan Garrison, resolutely used military industrial policies in the autumn of 1934 to build the Qinghai Library and the affiliated middle school of the Islamic Promotion Association on a large scale. He also established well-equipped Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui primary schools affiliated with the garrison command and established Mongol and Tibetan primary schools in Dulan County, far from the provincial capital. Such selflessness and impartiality, regardless of boundaries, and the establishment of a grand library to promote culture in the face of extreme economic difficulties are rare among military and police leaders in the border provinces and even rare among military commanders across the country. If a special commendation is not requested, it will not be enough to highlight public virtue and encourage future generations. In response to the report, the Ministry of Education, in addition to sending a letter of encouragement from Minister of Education Wang Shijie, also instructed that future border education should focus on developing resources, cultivating production, and uniting all ethnic groups to consolidate border defense.</p>

<p>Since the promulgation of the junior high school curriculum standards, the Ministry of Education has decided to replace military training with Boy Scout training, which shows the importance it attaches to children's training. Therefore, a Boy Scout instructor training class was held during the summer vacation last year, and fifteen directors of the National Boy Scout Council were hired to establish the National Boy Scout General Association. Since the Ministry has made children's training a compulsory course for junior high schools, specialized personnel are needed to manage the Boy Scout curriculum and various regulations. Recently, due to President Dai's recommendation, Yan Jialin was hired as a special editor. Mr. Yan arrived at the Ministry at the end of December last year to negotiate and settle matters. It is decided that after completing his original position at Huazhong University in Wuhan this month, he will go to the Ministry to take office.</p>

<p>Since the National Academic Work Consultation Office entrusted the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute to handle academic consultations in Shanghai, work has already begun. The Shanghai Social News reporter specially visited Mr. Yang Chonggao, the head of the institute, yesterday. According to his report, the academic work consultation events handled by the institute have already started. Regarding introductions, practical methods have been discussed with various factories, and many have been successfully introduced. Regarding registration, many people have completed the registration procedures in recent days and filled out fixed forms for submission to the consultation office. A report is also issued monthly, including the registration number, graduating school, major subject, previous position, and aspirations, for reference and to facilitate introductions at any time. Other matters, such as academic consultation and investigation, have not yet begun because the head office has not entrusted any work. Since accepting the entrustment, the institute has felt many difficulties, although the time has been short. In terms of introductions, once the institute has successfully introduced someone, the person being introduced often does not come or complains about low salaries or low positions, inevitably undermining the institute's credibility. Therefore, it is hoped that young people seeking employment can lower their expectations. In addition, there are also young people who already have jobs who come to register, but they cannot take up the job even after being successfully introduced. Therefore, it is hoped that those who already have jobs will be content with their current positions and not be swayed by changing their minds.</p>

<p>The Zhenru Rural Education Experimental Zone affiliated with the Education Department of Jinan University has been actively developing since its establishment. In addition to establishing the Qinjiage Rural Cooperative Planting Group and attaching several special contracted farmlands, a livestock cooperative group has recently been established. More than 20 members have joined the group. The area has self-compiled a sheep-raising textbook, with the level progressing from shallow to deep, which is very suitable for the needs of the villagers. There are nearly 2,000 villagers in the area, and recently, they have been very interested in all the facilities in the area. Every night, forty or fifty people come to the public tea garden attached to the area to sip tea. The problems discussed are mostly related to improving agricultural affairs. The day before yesterday, it was decided to ask the area to set up an agricultural affairs officer to guide the improvement of vegetable planting, cotton planting, and other work. Mr. Ma, the general secretary of the area, believes that the villagers' initiative to request agricultural guidance is indeed commendable, but because the original budget is insufficient, he has discussed with Jinan University Principal Shen Pengfei to allocate additional funds to facilitate the work.</p>

<p>The entrance examinations for the University of London and the intermediate degree examinations (The Matriculational lntsrmedoate gfinal examinations of londo nulivcrlilyl) are held once a year in Shanghai. Anyone with a sufficient level only needs to pass the examination in Shanghai to obtain a degree. Chinese students often lack expert guidance and sufficient preparation for the examinations, which is quite difficult. The London Normal Correspondence College (Normacorr spondcncec ollege londo), a specialized training institution for examinations (including examinations for London, Oxford, and Cambridge universities, secondary and primary school teacher certification, music teacher certification, and other specialized diploma examinations), has been established for fifty years and has forty-six famous professors in charge of education. The lectures and exercises provided to students are all suitable for the needs of the examinations. The study period for each subject is limited to one year. Thousands of British students complete the course and pass the examinations each year, with excellent results and a well-known reputation. The school also has elective courses for those who do not take the examinations but wish to pursue further studies. Both secondary and university levels are available, making it extremely convenient to choose. The tuition fees for each subject are low, and full or installment payments are available.

<p>A letter from the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau states: Dear Editor, upon reviewing your newspaper's publication yesterday (the 13th) of the news about the promotion and vocational guidance lectures held by our bureau, much of it is inconsistent with the facts. It is likely that the news agency reporter (Editor's note: This manuscript was sent by the Shanghai News Agency) wrote it hastily. The lecturers at the first venue on that day were Mr. Jiang Wenyu and Mr. Yang Weiyu, and the lecturers at the second venue were Mr. Zheng Tonghe and Mr. Yang Chonggao. The total number of attendees at the second venue was 408 people. This information is hereby conveyed, and it is hoped that you will investigate and make corrections. Respectfully, to the Shen Bao Editorial Department, Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, January 14th.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Jiangsu Social Education Facilities () <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>(Report by Zhou Fo-hai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, at the Provincial Government's Memorial Week)</p>
<p>Jiangsu's social education has made considerable progress in the past two years. According to recent statistics, the total expenditure on social education in various counties of Jiangsu Province amounts to 1,396,124 yuan. The provincial education funds allocated to social education are also 567,462 yuan, totaling 1,963,586 yuan. The social education institutions run by various counties include 151 public education centers, 141 farmer education centers, 41 libraries, 70 sports grounds, 17 public education experimental zones, 475 public reading rooms, and 121 other social education institutions, totaling 1,015 institutions. Various counties have 1,651 public schools, comprising 1,225 classes, with a total of 70,128 students. Compared to the 19th and 20th years of the Republic, there has been a significant increase. Back then, the total social education expenditure in various counties of the province was only over 1.31 million, and the counties only had more than 130 public education centers and more than 80 farmer education centers. Other institutions were also not as numerous as they are now. However, given that Jiangsu has spent so much money and established so many institutions, what is the state of these facilities, what are the effects, and how should they be improved in the future? A thorough examination should be conducted. A report is now presented separately as follows:</p>
<p>When I first came to Jiangsu, many people expressed dissatisfaction with Jiangsu's social education, saying that social education institutions were just taking money and not doing anything, as if they were retirement homes. When I looked at the inspection reports of social education in various counties, I realized that many of these criticisms were indeed factual. After much observation, I realized that there were four main reasons why Jiangsu's social education was so debilitated. First, the scope of work of social education institutions was too broad and lacked specific standards, so that they tried to do everything at the beginning, and as a result, nothing was done successfully. Second, in the past, the allocation of funds for social education institutions lacked specific standards, so most of the funds were used for salaries, and there was no way to carry out any projects. Third, in the past, the staff of social education institutions mostly lacked a thorough understanding of their responsibilities, so their work inevitably contained errors. Fourth, in the past, educational administrative agencies only focused on expanding social education as much as possible, and failed to pay enough attention to quality improvement, resulting in procrastination and complacency becoming a habit. Because I knew the reasons for the debilitation of social education in Jiangsu, the authorities immediately decided to focus on strengthening, rectifying, and evaluating work through administrative power. At that time, three key points were also decided. First, the standard for the allocation of funds for social education institutions was determined, that is, salaries should not be higher than 50%, project funds should not be lower than 40%, and administrative expenses should be 10%, to ensure that the projects carried out by various institutions can be carried out one after another. Second, important regulations such as the detailed rules of service and the evaluation procedures for directors and staff of social education institutions in various counties were formulated, and it was strictly ordered that directors and staff of social education institutions should not hold concurrent positions, so that all social education institutions would be responsible for planning and implementing the popularization and promotion of social education in their respective areas. Other social education institutions within the area must also be responsible for guidance, and the central institutions must also contact each other to jointly seek the improvement of social education in the entire county. After this method was stipulated, most counties were able to earnestly comply with it, and various social education institutions were also able to consciously strive for improvement. Now, many counties have established a social education center in each autonomous region, and some counties have not been able to do so due to economic reasons, but they will continue to promote this year by year in order to complete it.</p>

The A League match between Mai Ling and Xi Yunfei was quite exciting. Although Yunfei knew that they would definitely lose, they fought unremittingly. Under the strong attack, Mai Ling relied on Yao Bin's physique, and his shooting rarely missed, resulting in a score of 70 to 43.</p>

<p>Little Western Heaven</p>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Hearing Words, Hiding Tears to Sell Oneself and Lament Bitterness; Carefully Peering at Invitation Cards, Eagerly Seeking Refuge</p>
<p>Li Shilian waited for him to write the words on the acknowledgement slip, handed it over, and then smiled: Speaking of affection, Mr. Cheng is really something. Although he gave them two dollars, he didn't expect any benefits, just giving two dollars to help them survive. This is called bestowing kindness without expecting repayment. Apart from older people who are truly cultivating themselves, who can do that? Mr. Cheng is really worthy of admiration. As he said this, he stretched out both hands and held up two thumbs. Cheng Zhiqian smiled: If you say I'm affectionate, I won't admit it. If you say I'm a busybody, I'll admit it. As he spoke, he looked at Wang Beihai, wanting to ask him to bring the draft calculations he had brought. Li Shilian, however, did not want to leave immediately. He wanted to find out how his relationship with Director Gao was. He adopted a respectful attitude, bending his body slightly even while sitting, and asked with a smile: Mr. Cheng, your arrival in Xi'an has brought a lot of glory to those of us from the East, and you are welcomed everywhere. As for us, it's impossible to ask someone for even a bite to eat. Isn't it extremely shameful? Cheng Zhiqian smiled and said: It's nothing really. Because there are two officials here who are old friends of mine, and through their introductions, I've gotten to know more people. For officials, entertaining guests is unavoidable. It doesn't hurt to bring me along to dinner. For example, tonight, Gao Hesheng is hosting a dinner for Yuan Youwei's younger brother. He can't just invite his two brothers to eat a whole table of food, so he has to find more people to fill the table. So, bringing us along not only doesn't take anything away from him but also implies that we're helping him out. But then again, the fact that he's willing to have us help him out means he thinks highly of me. Otherwise, as a director in Xi'an City, he's a second-class wealthy person, and people would be rushing to show their respect. (112)</p>

<p>— Ding Weinan</p>
<p>Here, the scarlet blood of our compatriots was once smeared; it endured the artillery fire and bombs of the tyrannical sun; it was imprinted with the traces of wooden sandals. The scene is filled with rubble and withered grass, and the setting sun shines on it, causing the flowing wind to stir up dust. The desolate appearance makes people unable to help but shed tears! There are no complete houses, only scattered and broken remains, crippled walls, and charred buildings – all surrounded by utter devastation! Quiet and miserable, it seems that this is not a world for people.</p>
<p>How long has it been? And this place is no longer what it was then! We can see new buildings, very smooth roads, and bustling pedestrians; the wailing of cars brings back the atmosphere of the city that had once died. Inside the fence made of bamboo, the songs of rebirth sound out. The painful scars are healing.</p>
<p>At night, we can also see moving neon lights, although this is not like the "Concession," which has sleepless streets, Europeans, Americans, foreign bastards, and Japanese brothels. There are also enchanting eyes and smiling faces, as well as white eyes and depressed faces. But here, in this "Zhabei" that was once sacrificed, this northern part of Shanghai city, the "Chinese territory" that the Chinese often talk about, naturally still has some urban qualities, although it can't catch up with the "foreign territory" that the Chinese often talk about, which is so prosperous and lively. But it's still not bad. Although this newly healed patient is still lacking in health, the doctor's surgery will not have been in vain!</p>
<p>However, scars cover the whole body. The scars of one or two wounds can be treated, but how can the shadow of humiliation above them be erased? This must be asked of those compatriots who have not died!</p>

<p>Glass breaks instantly when hit by a stone; wood is easily split when met with iron. Examining their physical properties, one lacks cohesive force and is not united, and is trampled upon; the other is rich in cohesive force and is solid and united, making it impossible for people to start. Therefore, people also value unity. In large cases, it is the whole country; in small cases, it is a family, only then will they be spared from being insulted.</p>

<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>Hongkou is the Japanese expatriate district of Shanghai. From time to time, you see monks from that country who don't knock on wooden fish but beat small drums, banging and clanging non-stop. Based on figurative speculation, it is naturally like Chinese monks begging for alms; some people call them foreign monks. Foreign monks also hold onto the devoutness of their beliefs. They travel back and forth on the concrete roads, which are two hundred yards long. The difference between them and Chinese monks is only in the speed of their steps. They stride like the wind, while we move slowly like yellow oxen plowing the fields. Monks have no ethnic boundaries, but in spirit, there is a clear distinction.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a true foreign beggar on Christmas! Jesus's Christmas! Before that day, Christians were already preparing for a passionate, unrestrained celebration. Messengers in green were working harder for Christmas, delivering blessings in greeting cards. Department stores were decorating with many stories of Santa Claus for Christmas, advertising their products. At this time, western bums took advantage of the opportunity to dress up as Santa Claus in the Nanjing and Huilu company area, seemingly with the sincere intention of Jesus saving the world, blessing various shops. The white, long beard fluttered across the chest, with silver hair all over the head, wearing a red scarf, and a brand-new scarlet robe with white edges. I glanced over from the tram car, as if he was holding a piece of chalk in his hand, writing words of blessing on the glass window of the shop! Curious people followed a large crowd to watch the excitement, and there were also two Indian police officers maintaining order. After the blessing words were written, naturally there would be a "reaching out General!" This is exactly the same as on the night of the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month in the mainland, when beggars dressed up as the Kitchen God in advance and "jump the Kitchen God" along the street; shouting loudly: "The Kitchen God is here, the boss's business is buzzing!" (meaning prosperous). Jump left and get rich! Jump right and get rich! Not jumping also gets rich! Followed by three cannons, ...tong, ...tong, ...tong; after the auspicious words were finished, it was also "reaching out General;" however, it is a bit blasphemous to the Holy Lord and the gods to use the fake Jesus Kitchen God as a front for begging.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The distance between them was about a foot and a half, but it could be wider or narrower, as they were not tied down by anything, just hanging in the air. I stared at them for a good while, unable to figure out whether they were decorations or tools; and if they were tools, what were they used for? Finally, I couldn't hold back any longer and respectfully asked the Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>She first smiled at me proudly, and this smile clearly indicated that she had a true understanding of this strange object, thanks to reading more books or listening to people talk about it; so I stood up attentively, ready to receive her grand instruction.</p>
<p>"This thing certainly has its use!" Her first sentence made it clear to me that it was a tool, not a decoration. "But to explain its use," she added, "we must first go to the back to take a look!"</p>
<p>With that, she waved to the person in charge of the archery range—who was also an official. This person hurried forward, approached the back door, removed the bolt, and pushed both doors open at once. He then stepped aside. A rectangular open space appeared before our eyes, its end about thirty or forty zhang away from where we were standing. Opposite us was a tall, massive stone wall, with a few trees and small houses planted on both sides, presumably the residences of the people in charge of the archery range. In the center was a stone-free path five or six zhang wide; it must have been very flat before, but now it was covered with weeds. (222)</p>

<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Advertising is a necessary weapon in the commercial battle, and also the second life of a store. Whether a store is large or small, if it is not good at advertising, then even if the goods are piled up like mountains, no one will inquire about them, and the result will inevitably be closure due to unbearable losses. Therefore, general stores all attach extreme importance to advertising. However, in the writing of advertisements, some exaggerate too much, causing readers to lose faith, while others are too honest, lacking gimmicks, and thus lose the effectiveness of advertising. Therefore, writing advertisements must indeed consider all aspects. For example, Tian Xiaode Fur Bureau published a huge advertisement, wildly exaggerating about a disastrous drop in prices, falling into the core of its capital. If that were really the case, I'm afraid other fur stores would have to close. I wanted to buy a fur coat, and because I saw the advertisement for Tian Xiaode Fur Bureau, stating that a blue fox coat priced over a thousand yuan was now selling for less than two-tenths of the original price, I couldn't help but be moved. I went to buy one in person, but after seeing the goods, I was greatly disappointed! It turned out that this fur bureau, which hadn't really fallen into the core of its capital, was only charging high prices. Therefore, I dared not take advantage of this "bargain" and, as a result, thought about the advertisement. If it's described too extravagantly, not only will it fail to attract customers, but it may also lose their faith, and everyone will scold them as a slippery Tian Xiaode!</p>

<h3 id="e200">American Husband, Japanese Wife <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>In the world, American husbands are the best, and Japanese wives are the best—this is a well-known fact.</p>
<p>Kushida Hakuson tells us in "Impressions of North America":</p>
<p>"Two people walk in shoulder to shoulder, intimately and with smiles, and sit in a fixed position in the dining hall. This is the French style. The husband walks in front, hands in his pockets, glancing left and right, chest proudly puffed out, and the wife follows behind. This is the English style. Now, look! In America, the wife enters majestically, bestowing a glance upon her subjects to the left and right, and takes her throne first. The husband follows later—this is the American style." Is this the only good thing about American husbands? The answer is "no." Then please say a little more.</p>
<p>To talk about the good things about American husbands, they are truly extraordinarily good. If you don't believe it, look at the evenings on holidays. Who is at home playing with the children, patiently waiting for his "dear" until the night is late? Is it the man or the woman? According to our Chinese custom, it is of course the woman. But if you say it's the woman, you're wrong. It turns out that the woman goes out to socialize, and the man stays at home to wait. That is the American custom, and it can be said to be an iron rule that cannot be changed. But is it just waiting at the door? Not at all. No matter how tired he is, almost falling asleep, as soon as he hears the doorbell ring, he will immediately go to the door cheerfully to open it. The elegant wife walks in, and he lets her go first, then closes the door and follows behind. When they reach the room, the woman lifts her foot, and the man skillfully says, "Yes, dear." As he says this, he immediately takes off the woman's arched shoes. At that time, he has to be careful not to let his nose get hit by the shoes, because the woman lifts her foot too close to the man's nose.</p>
<p>When going out on the street, the man follows behind the woman, carrying her coat and the items she bought. If there are children, he also has to push the stroller. If the woman's shoelaces come undone, the man also has to run two steps ahead to tie them up.</p>
<p>At home, when his wife is talking to her friends, the man has no right to speak. If he wants to speak, he must first ask the Queen for permission. All of these things are too numerous to mention. Fortunately, I am not writing a "Guide to American Husbands" here, so omitting some things is not likely to be harmful.</p>
<p>So what about Japanese wives? Quite coincidentally, they are in stark contrast to American wives. Brewing tea, cooking rice, taking care of children, washing clothes, sweeping the floor... there is nothing that is not a woman's job. If a man has guests, it is the woman's job to kneel and offer fragrant tea to the guests. It is also something a woman cannot object to if her husband pawns her pants to get money for him to go to prostitutes.</p>
<p>I once read an article recently published on "Truetoty" titled "I Married a Japanese Man." It was a story about an American woman who married a Japanese man and suffered endless contempt and hardship. As an American woman living the bitter life of a Japanese wife, we can naturally imagine what it's like.</p>
<p>What about Chinese couples? Is the husband a slave to the wife, or is the wife a slave to the husband? We only need to observe the facts a little to answer very straightforwardly: those at the forefront of the trend are American, and those who are behind the times are still thoroughly Chinese. (Japan is the descendant of Xu Fu of our country, so China and Japan are similar.) Which is right and which is wrong is something for specialized scholars to study. I have only fulfilled a bit of the responsibility of introducing it. However, before getting married, please first decide in your heart what kind of husband or wife you want to be.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Rumors of Financial Loans Re-emerge, Target Price Tries to Rise but Lacks Power <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>—Resulting in a Reversal and a Drop of One Yuan One One—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's upward trend was once again hindered due to the re-emergence of rumors of loans and the hardening of the foreign exchange market, resulting in a mid-course reversal. The Central Bank took advantage of the low prices to open spot trading, and gradually stabilized after the low. In the morning, overseas silver markets were flat in British currency but shrunk in American currency. The forward silver price at Mont-de-Pieté rose slightly. There were both rises and falls in foreign exchange rates. The price of London raw gold fell two pence. The off-exchange preliminary transaction opened and immediately rose to 63.34 yuan. Buyers surged in, and it rose again to 63.45 yuan. The Central Bank's listed price was announced, with British currency flat and American currency up 1.875. The Customs Gold Unit fell three thousandths, and the target price standard price retreated to 997 yuan, without much impact. The situation remained stable. After opening, due to rumors that a certain bank was borrowing 500,000 pounds from a certain Western merchant, selling pressure suddenly increased and gradually retreated to within 60 yuan. Buyers were active in taking advantage of the low prices, maintaining the market to some extent. However, the foreign exchange market hardened due to West Merchant Sassoon's tendency to fulfill spot orders first, and large players re-emerged, causing a one-time drop. But because the Central Bank opened spot trading at a target price of 957 yuan, confidence was boosted, and buyers continued to be active, gradually rising back to above 61 yuan. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. At this point, supply and demand were balanced, and the market was sluggish. Although it broke the 60 yuan mark again due to floating profits being closed out after entering, the buying interest of large players gradually increased, and the foreign exchange market had turned stable. Although there were fluctuations in the middle, the overall trend was mediocre, without much change. At noon, the phenomenon of banks having a buying appetite turned the situation prosperous, and large players came back to buy. In the afternoon, the market tended to be firm. Banks took advantage of the situation to fulfill orders, and the foreign exchange market still had a tendency to loosen. With supply exceeding demand in the market, large players entered and then exited. The gold market then turned from high to fall, but confidence was still stable. Buyers were active in taking advantage of the low prices, making it easy to pull up the market. Although Indian silver initially reported a rise of nine annas, there was a slight decline. However, because the Central Bank continued to open spot trading, the price was maintained at 959 yuan. Thereafter, there was limited trading in the market. Although there was a rebound, it soon declined slightly again. Finally, Indian silver declined slightly by two annas, and the gold market entered a dull state. Starting at 3:00 p.m. today, February term rollover trading will be held, with the premium estimated to be advanced by the short side by about 6-7 yuan, depending entirely on the strength of the long side. Now, the day's market conditions are recorded as follows: the morning opening was 964.4 yuan, an increase of 0.7 yuan compared to last week. Da Decheng, Heng Yuchang, Da Qianchangxiang, etc. all sold, falling to 64 yuan. Hengchang, Yong Yuanchang, Yong Wanchang, and Yong took advantage of the low prices to submit orders, rising to 962.3 yuan. The foreign exchange market hardened, and banks were doing business in this month's shillings at 5/125 pence. Sassoon also had orders to fulfill. Fuxing, Yongheng, Yu Fuyuanyu, and Maoyong all sold, breaking the 60 yuan mark and falling to 59.3 yuan. Yifeng, Yongheng, Yu Fuxing, Yong Dafayong, and Qianchangxiang bought in at low prices, gradually rising to above 61 yuan. At this time, it was learned in advance that HSBC's listed price was up 1/125 for British currency and 25 cents for American currency, hovering around 1 yuan. When McGalli sold March U.S. dollars at 25 cents, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Dafayong, Hengyuyu sold again, closing out floating profits and falling to 58.7 yuan. Da Decheng, Yifeng, Qianchangxiang, Yingfeng, Hengheng Yufutai, Hengyuanyu, Yitianfeng, Fuxing, Yong Licheng, etc. all purchased orders. The Central Bank once opened spot trading at a price of 957 yuan, gradually rising to above 71 yuan. The silver equalization tax was announced without change. At this time, Qianchangxiang, Da Decheng, Zhaofengchang, Yuanyong, Fuyu, etc. had mixed ins and outs, hovering around 1 yuan. Later, closing out floating profits, it once dropped to 59.7 yuan. Yukang, Dafayong, Yong Yongli, Hengyu, Da Dayuanyi, etc. successively bought in, rising to 62.5 yuan. Futaiheng and Zhaofengchang took profits at high prices, retreating to 1.3 yuan. However, because Yuanchangyong, Fuchang Da Decheng, Fuxingyong Hengchangyong all entered, it rose again to 962.9 yuan. Huabi Citibank bought March U.S. dollars at 25 cents. Although Shunmao Dakang sold to 62 yuan, Da Decheng still submitted, and the noon close still rose to 962.8 yuan. After the market closed, it was stable.</p>
<p>The post-market opened at 963.7 yuan. Fuxing Yongyuan and Changyong submitted orders, rising to 64.2 yuan. Dafayong Da Decheng Hengyu Fuxingyong Fuyuyuanyi, etc. sold one after another. HSBC Mitsui released February U.S. dollars at 4375 cents, gradually falling to 63.5 yuan. Changwen Fuan took advantage of the low prices to submit orders, rising to above 63.6 yuan, the situation was mediocre. It then rose to 962.6 yuan. Mumbai's initial telegram reported a rise of 9.88 annas. Zhaofengchang Hengyu sold, falling to 61.7 yuan. The Central Bank slightly opened spot trading again, priced at 959 yuan. Yingfeng Henglifeng, etc. in the market entered orders and rose, but because Hengyu, etc. were still selling, there was a lot of hovering. After entering, Hengyu exited and re-entered, and Zhaofengchang Yuanyi also purchased, so it rebounded to 63.2 yuan. Yu Maoyong Hengyu and Changda, etc. exited, falling to 62.1 yuan. Mumbai's third report came back with a small decline of 2.11 annas, and it was stable. Although Bingxing sold, but because Hengyu came to enter, retail investors also raised, and the closing price rose again to 962.6 yuan. After the market closed, it was flat and tired due to Da Fashui Fuxing slightly selling. Looking at the highest price of the day, 964.4 yuan, and the lowest price, 958.7 yuan, there was a difference of 5.7 yuan. As a result, it fell 1.1 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's target price standard price, retreated to 997 yuan, about 34 yuan lower based on the closing price, with a very small difference compared to last Saturday. The February registration price was 963 yuan, with the morning top-up water at 949 yuan, and the afternoon top-up water at the same price. The price of pure gold increased by 5 yuan to 969.4 yuan. The spot market was stable, and trading in the market was still active. Tianjin goods increased by more than 8 yuan. In the front market, 350 taels were sold by the Tianjin gang, with an increase of 8.65 yuan. In the after market, another 470 taels were sold, with an increase of 8.45 yuan, purchased by the spot number Yingfengheng. The Central Bank continued to open spot trading for 560 orders, priced at 955 yuan to 957 yuan. There were also a few transactions in the after market, priced at 959 yuan, generally more than 3 yuan lower than the term target. The February slips handled by the spot number Yingfengheng, etc. will begin to roll over at 3:00 p.m. today, with the premium estimated to be advanced by the selling side by about 6-7 yuan, mainly because the Central Bank's opening spot price is still 3-4 yuan lower than the term target, but the foreign interest has been lowered, and the buying side's psychology has turned flat. The overall situation is not as embarrassing as the previous session.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In total, Yongli Shunmao, Wanchang Yongyongde, Hengchang Yongyuanyi, Zhaofengchang Yicheng, Tongtaichang, Futaiheng Lifeng, Yuanchang Yonghengyu, Ruixing Qianchangxiang, etc. were on the buying side, while Fuyu Juchang Hengxing, Yuanhongxing Da Decheng Changsheng Yong Dada Renfayong, Zhengchang Jinlong Dingkang, etc. were on the selling side. Fuyu cut about 1,400 more orders. Fuxing Yongyuan Maoyong Qianchangxiang Futaiheng first advanced and then exited. Da Decheng Yifengyong Dada first exited and then entered. The Dalian gang Wanxing did not do 800 in total, flat after settlement. Shunli did 500 in total, and Youli was also flat after settlement. Trading in the Guang gang Shengda Hengxing was still quiet. The number of transactions on that day totaled 24,346 orders in the morning and only 9,828 orders in the afternoon. The number of February chips totaled 24,738 orders, with a total of 53 long positions and 60 short positions.</p>

Compared to last Saturday, both British and American currencies were flat. The Central Bank's listed price was announced, with British currency flat and American currency up 1875, and the Customs Gold Unit shrunk by three thousandths, lacking impact. Then, due to rumors of the establishment of Western merchant loans, confidence was immediately fatigued. In addition, Sassoon and others sold shillings. HSBC's listed price was announced, with the British currency up 125 and the American currency up 25. Banks also sold U.S. dollars, and the process immediately hardened. The Central Bank opened spot trading, and banks took advantage of the cheap prices to settle, and the process became flat. The silver equalization tax was announced without change. Thereafter, the situation was mediocre, and the trend was set. At noon, the potential trend was slightly tighter, and banks already had a buying appetite. In the afternoon, the market was flat and stable. Unexpectedly, the banks' appetite was fulfilled, and the Chinese merchants' buying appetite was sluggish again, and the process loosened. However, the transaction was normal. Indian silver initially rose by nine annas, but because the Central Bank still opened spot trading, it was able to maintain. Finally, Indian silver declined slightly by two annas, and the overall trend was mediocre. By the closing price, the recent selling price was one shilling five pence 0.0625 for British currency and 34.9375 yuan for American currency.

<p>At present, although the Gregorian New Year has passed, the Lunar New Year is just around the corner. Therefore, the silver money industry, because of the old customs of the Fuhui, has to start winding down, causing the financial market atmosphere to gradually soften and the market situation to be not very prosperous. The foreign interest market price in the morning and noon was still 2.1 jiao, with no difference from the previous day. The addition of water to the scratch head was white throughout. The transfer transaction of draft tickets in the morning was over 1.8 million, and the new transaction was over 900,000. The transaction in the noon market was over 400,000.

<p>Minor fluctuations… market state hovering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was still in a hovering state, without any waves. Both sides were still observing. Although the foreign interest rate shrunk to 2.1 jiao again, the market sentiment was not excited. It was not like the previous crazy high, which shocked people, and no one paid attention to the current big drop. When the foreign interest rate was crazily high, the silver root was tight and the sellers were enthusiastic. When the foreign interest rate fell sharply, the silver root was not seen to be loose. Therefore, the bulls were content, and the large number of shorts released last time had no intention of hedging. The retail arbitrage transactions last time were also not seen to be swapped. In terms of chip supply and demand, the supply was still greater than the demand. Therefore, it was temporarily unable to invigorate. The future of the market price, hoping for a big rise, depends on whether the retail hedging is consistently swapped and whether the large shorts rise up to hedge. Otherwise, relying solely on sporadic entry and exit, even if it does not decline, it will not be able to get out of the hovering state. Yesterday, the market did not rise in the morning opening due to the big loosening of the foreign interest rate. On the contrary, the sellers in the market were seen to be lively. Numbers 5 and 47 were sold more, and the market price fell by one or two jiao, dejected and unmotivated, making people bored. The transaction was increasingly rare. The second-hand transaction still had an excess supply, and the previous column continued to shrink by two or three jiao. Number 23 in the tail column had a slight buying appetite and stabilized slightly. In the afternoon opening, Number 38 had a lot of hedging, and confidence was slightly firm. The large multi-party temporarily stopped coming out, so it was able to rise slightly, with Zhengliuhao Triangular being the most. The closing price continued to rise with the trend. Number 38 still had a buying appetite, the previous column got better by one or two jiao, and the latter column still could not cheer up. On the whole, it still failed to get out of the hovering. Calculating the results of its market price, ups and downs were seen, and most were only five cents, one jiao to two jiao. Among them, the difference between the demobilization falling by three jiao and the Zhengliu rising by two and a half jiao was the largest. The total number of transactions was 7.56 million yuan. Now, the results of its rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e206">Yarn Flower: Yarn Recipients Scarce This Month <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially showed fatigue, then firmed up, but the overall sentiment remains soft. Many are psychologically affected by the adverse environment and the weakening overseas cotton industry. Tongcheng Company seems unwilling to accept goods this month, with more short positions closing, leading to a price drop. In the afternoon, news of active spot yarn purchases from the southern ports revitalized the market slightly.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster: Lower in the Morning, Slight Rebound in the Afternoon) The opening of the futures yarn market was weak due to the consistent downward trend of foreign cotton. Tongcheng Company showed no intention to accept goods this month, with more short positions being closed. Prices for all months fell by 3-4 jiao. In the afternoon, news emerged that both Guangdong and Zhejiang factions were seeking to expand their spot yarn holdings, and rumors of early shutdowns at yarn factories were rife. This curbed the selling pressure. At the close, over 1,200 bales of spot goods were traded, with even more covering of short positions. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1-4 jiao. It was noted that 1,650 bales of Dafu, 450 bales of Dafeng, 1,100 bales of Mingde, 2,400 bales of Gengfeng, 350 bales of Yuanda, and 400 bales of Shenji were sold. The buyers were Junchang (500 bales), Shenchang (1,200 bales), Tongfeng (300 bales), Taichang (400 bales), Yongchang (1,200 bales), Dachang (400 bales), Deji (450 bales), and Changfeng (400 bales). The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>

<p>Total 215,950</p>
<p>(Active Spot Purchases in South China) Spot yarn sales have become more active again. It is estimated that all factions bought a total of 1,275 bales throughout the day. The market was weak in the morning but firmed up in the afternoon, resulting in a decrease of 2.5-5 jiao. The purchase amounts for each faction were as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 125 Haizhou 10 Anqing 5 Yunnan 280 Changsha 70 Zhenjiang 45 Peers 7 Ningbo 15 Guangdong 680 Fujian 8 Shantou 2 Jiangxi 20</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon. Foreign cotton prices declined across the board. Indian cotton, Omra type, fell sharply by 6 rupees 25. At the same time, exchange rates rose, and gold prices remained flat, further dampening market sentiment. Selling pressure intensified, causing market prices to fall. In the afternoon, news of a rebound in off-market Indian cotton and a revitalization of the yarn market prompted short covering, leading to a slight recovery. (Zheng Biao: Weak Market Sentiment) The opening of the futures cotton market was weak due to the sharp fall in Indian cotton. Short positions were actively sold off, causing distant months to fall by 3 jiao. News of flat gold prices in the second session, but Gengfeng reversed from short to long by the third session, buying over 12,000 dan, tightening the market slightly and causing a rebound of 5 fen. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1-2 jiao. The afternoon opening still saw a large number of sellers, and market sentiment remained weak. By the third session, the market surged due to higher yarn prices and short covering. Prices for all months rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. It was noted that Tongji (1,300 dan), Dafu (1,200 dan), Tongfu (2,900 dan), Hengyi (1,300 dan), Junchang (1,200 dan), Renfeng (2,200 dan), Changfeng (3,000 dan), Runkang (3,900 dan), Yuanxingchang (2,700 dan), and Yifeng (3,200 dan) were sold. The buyers were Meiji (1,300 dan), Dafeng (3,900 dan), Suilong (1,900 dan), Yuanda (3,300 dan), Jinchang (1,000 dan), Gengfeng (13,500 dan), Yongchang (1,400 dan), Dafu (1,000 dan), and Yikang (1,800 dan). The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Open Account</p>
<p>January 36.35 36.20 36.35 Up 1.10 106,300</p>

<p>Total 649,800</p>
<p>(Raw Cotton Mills Halt Production) Spot cotton consumption remains sluggish, partly because factories are closed for several days at the end of the lunar year, and some may shut down early. Secondly, tight credit conditions, despite appearing loose, further impact spot cotton demand. Market sentiment is slightly soft. The sources were Yao flower (50 bales) and Tong flower (175 bales).</p>

<p>The Bombay market at the beginning of the week was quite active due to large speculative trading. However, as the movement of new cotton increased, bulls took profits, and buyers were scarce, prices fell sharply. However, unfavorable weather in some cotton-growing areas delayed the arrival of new cotton, and Japanese firms bought, and shorts covered, resulting in a slight rebound. Spot cotton exports are slightly limited due to high prices, and inquiries are also low. Foreign firms are selling to hedge. The statistics for the previous week are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1934 1935</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1st 523 570</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 739 563</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for Broach cotton on the 14th is 238 rupees per candy, an increase of 1 rupee from the previous day's close.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the prices for all months were uniformly flat and weak. The quotation for foreign wheat was down about 1 jiao per bushel in Chicago and about 4 cents in Canada. At the opening, the current month was supported by continued purchases from northern merchants. However, most were buying lower-grade flour, and No. 2 flour was relatively stagnant, dampening market sentiment. The opening prices for distant months were weak due to continued trading of foreign wheat over the weekend, leading to active selling. However, with the expiration date approaching, both buying and selling were light, and the price declines were minimal. By the afternoon opening, the market for all months returned to quiet. Bulls were unwilling to exit, and factories rarely sold off, resulting in sideways trading across the board. The future direction will depend on foreign wheat. As a result, the current month was down 2.5 li, February was unchanged, March was up 0.5 fen, April was down 2.5 li, May was down 0.5 fen, and June was unchanged.</p>

<p>A wild decline in the afternoon!</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, the prices for all months were generally quiet. The quotation for foreign wheat was down about 1 jiao per bushel in Chicago and about 4 cents in Canada. After the opening, the prices for all months were slightly down by 2-3 fen due to some bulls exiting as the expiration approached. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment for both near and distant months suddenly turned negative. The current month was affected by mills not buying and clients selling back. Distant months saw frequent hedging by traders, leading to brisk trading and a sharp decline in market prices. With the continued pressure from foreign wheat, the future of the wheat market may see further changes. As a result, the current month plummeted 1 jiao 1 fen, February fell 8 fen, March fell 4 fen, and June fell 6 fen. The spot wheat market saw a sharp decline in prices, with bids down 3-4 fen. Shandong Guide wheat was quoted at 4 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 3 yuan 9 jiao 6-7 fen, and Taiwan wheat at 3 yuan 9 jiao 8 fen. It is said that Fuxin purchased 6,000 bags.</p>

<p>Foreign rice temporarily remains weak and stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market was weak due to sluggish demand. There were also slightly more expiring contracts, and the market was affected by foreign rice. The market fell slightly by a jiao. Over 2,000 bags were subsequently purchased from the interior. Local merchants also purchased 300-400 bags. However, the cost of Ke Xian is quite high, and some cargo owners are still unwilling to sell at lower prices. Yesterday, the sentiment for foreign rice stabilized as prices in the producing areas rose. The market is temporarily weak and stable. Yesterday, interior sales were more active, with limited local transactions. A total of over 2,000 bags were traded. In futures, Yuanli sold 1,000 tons of Saigon rice for April delivery at 4 yuan 7 jiao 2 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sources for various Shanghai South factions were similar to the previous day, with over 30 firms arriving (a total of over 6,000 shi of goods). However, due to continuous rain, the sales market was slow, and few transactions occurred. Prices for thick geng rice and late rice fell by several fen to a jiao. As for Du Yangjian and Bian Yuan varieties, some had no market due to shortages. Only Yin Yuan moved slightly, without significant gains or losses. Rain began early in the morning in Shanghai North and continued until noon. No trading occurred.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yellow soybean market was slightly weaker compared to the previous week due to weak purchasing power, intermittent sales, and tight credit conditions, resulting in a soft market sentiment. It is estimated that factories purchased 1,400 bags of Guide soybeans at 3 yuan 7 jiao and 300 bags of Yingzhou soybeans at 3 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen. Local merchants purchased 300 bags of Dalian Sipingjie soybeans at 4 yuan. In the interior, local merchants purchased over 2,000 bags of Hankou Zhazitou soybeans at 3 yuan 4 jiao to 4 jiao 3. 200 bags of Hankou Late soybeans were priced at 3 yuan 4 jiao. The price of Hankou soybeans continued to fall by 4 fen due to abundant inventory ("estimated at over 80,000 bags, including goods stockpiled by merchants"). Although there were over 500 trucks of Dalian soybeans, the selling pressure was still flat due to tight local market conditions. Other types of soybeans are also strong externally but weak internally. Therefore, with the expiration date approaching, there is little room for optimism during this period.</p>

<p>Yesterday, prices for coarse sugar and white sugar continued to ease due to increased spot availability. The trend for domestic green sugar remained stable, and there are reports that land prices are still rising, showing no signs of weakness. The guild quoted the price of ordinary spot No. 24 coarse sugar and white sugar at 18 yuan 9 jiao, and local warehouse goods at 19 yuan, down 5 fen from the previous day. Re-exported goods were quoted at 5 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, but there were still no transactions. No. 89 Dutch red sugar was quoted at 13 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, also down 5 fen. Taikoo sugar and local factory white sugar remained unchanged in price. Regarding grade goods, Chaozhou merchants offered 2,000 packages of Chaoqing sugar, with a premium for wharf Qing at 11 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 10 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, Nanqing at 10 yuan 4 jiao 5 jiao, and Longgang Qing at 10 yuan 2 jiao. According to Shantou telegrams, land prices remain tight and may rise further. There were also over 200 packages of branch red sugar quoted at 13 yuan 4 jiao to 13 yuan. There were also over 100 packages of branch foreign sugar quoted at 15 yuan 8 jiao · 7 jiao · 5 jiao. Xinghua merchants offered a batch of Xinghua Qing, not less than 100 packages, priced at 10 yuan 3 jiao.</p>

<p>Sugar sales were good last week. The total amount of foreign sugar was reduced by 38,677 packages compared to the previous week. For domestic green sugar, approximately 20,000 packages of Chaoqing were sold, nearly 10,000 packages of slice Qing, and 4,000-5,000 packages of miscellaneous Qing and red sugar.

<p>Southern Tang gorgon fruit is scarce due to the poor harvest this autumn, and market prices are rising. The inventory in Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce. It is found that only two merchants in the market still have over 100 packages. Therefore, market prices are particularly firm. The current market price has reached 100 yuan. Recently, there have been transactions from local merchants and the Fujian faction in the interior. Pond gorgon fruit has a thicker inventory, but there is no expectation of a good market. Yesterday, the market price was 19 yuan, and sales were still active, but the trend is stable.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Oil Market: Sichuan Exchange Rate Soars, Tung Oil <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Foreign firms in Hankou have a long history of establishing plantations in Chongqing and Wanxian in Sichuan Province to purchase white tung oil. During this peak season for new goods, foreign firms are competing to purchase. White tung oil is one of the largest products of Sichuan Province, truly worthy of being a region blessed by nature. However, financial relations with other provinces have historically been isolated. Recently, the Sichuan exchange rate has suddenly soared, now reaching 1,680 yuan. The internal financial panic is imaginable. As a result, it is difficult for foreign firms to purchase tung oil from the producing areas. Some are observing, and some are abandoning purchases. The majority are turning to Hankou and Changde in Hunan Province to purchase. Hankou and Changde are now seeing a shortage of supply. Therefore, merchants in Hankou have been importing goods from other places in recent days, and prices are increasing daily. Previously, foreign firms in Hankou were selling at 31 yuan per dan. That price is now a thing of the past. Considering the current imports, the price at foreign firms must be 32 yuan. Although there have been no transactions, a storm is brewing. Considering this, the market will continue to rise, and the situation is evident. Since the Hankou market is like this, Zhejiang tung oil is also affected and following suit. The asking price in Hangzhou was 26 yuan per stone the day before yesterday, and the market now has to increase the price. In general, foreign firms have a strong demand for goods, and demand everywhere exceeds supply. What is most difficult is that this year is a drought year. The oil produced in drought-stricken areas is not up to the standards required by foreign firms. Therefore, it is even more difficult to find goods suitable for export. The quality standards of foreign firms are extremely strict, requiring 1.5170, or at least 1.5168. However, most of the oil produced in drought-stricken areas this year is between 1.5154 and 1.5. Therefore, goods that meet the standards are even more scarce and valuable.</p>

<p>There is not much silk in stock in Shanghai, and market prices have risen accordingly. Trading was once booming. Although telegrams from overseas indicate prices 30-40 yuan lower, the local market in this city remains robust. Recently, the number of goods advanced by stockpilers has been large. The number of goods required for textile production by silk stocking factories and those purchased in advance (silk stocking factories typically purchase goods in advance at the beginning of the year or because there is no formal market at the beginning of the new year) is also similar. Silk merchants are also holding firm on prices, resulting in no transactions in recent days. Both buyers and sellers seem to be temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>

<h3 id="e229">On the Issue of Mutual Permeation between Literature and Science <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Linking literature and science together and allowing them to permeate each other is indeed a current pressing topic. However, the science referred to here is not social science, but natural science.</p>
<p>The issue of close linkage between literature and social sciences seems to have been thoroughly elucidated in the past, because literature is the lower foundation of ideology. Moreover, recently, engaging in literary creation without even applying the methods of social science, needless to say, such literary works are merely castles in the air. This fact clearly indicates the inseparability of literature and social science. Although the fact that literature is a department of social science is very clear, there are indeed people still talking about the close cooperation between literature and social science recently. Of course, there is no regret, only a feeling that it is "an old saying."</p>
<p>As for the issue of mutually permeating literature and natural science, I believe some people will indeed find it strange to fuse two completely different methods into one, and permeate each other. It seems unreasonable and strange indeed. In fact, this only lies in how to deal with natural science. Of course, we know that Darwin's theory of biological evolution based on survival competition and natural selection cannot be applied to social science, and chemical stoichiometry, cannot be arranged in literary works. However, we believe that we are not so mechanical. Our main purpose is to sort out the themes.</p>
<p>The omnipotence of natural science is no longer a question at present. The growth of human knowledge and culture relies on the development of natural science and is becoming more and more advanced. Our literature today is not something rooted in space. Our literature must be rooted in the real society and strive for the task of cultural growth. In this way, both natural science and literature strive for the growth of modern human culture. The purpose is the same, only the methods and forms are different.</p>
<p>Gorky once said, "The construction of popular scientific literature is an urgent and indispensable thing for the cultural education of the general public. Literary masters must assist practical scientific masters to express scientific ideas, theories, and work in simple and easy forms." Indeed, the construction of scientific literature is the beginning of the mutual permeation of science and literature. As for how to construct it without obliterating the unique characteristics of literature itself, it is indeed an event that should be investigated.</p>
<p>Natural science is indeed bitter, dry, and mechanical, without literary emotion. The abstract truth of a thing does not gain the reader's joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness. Therefore, in order to educate the public with popular scientific knowledge without making them feel bitter, dry, and boring, using the form of literature and taking natural science as the material is the best method. At the same time, the opposite is to use science as a background, as a kind of decoration, which is the worst trend. This trend completely treats science, scientists, and the lives of scientists as the background of old social people's themes such as love, death, marriage, family relationships, and personal problems, rather than taking science as a kind of novel theme. There are many examples of this in Japanese literary works, such as Riichi Yokomitsu's "Bird" and "Doctor," which feature mineralogy graduates as protagonists, and Yasunari Kawabata's "Requiem," which uses mental science as its background. However, like Leonov's "Skutarevsky," which uses the technical intellectual class as a turning point, and Afinogenov's drama "Fear," which describes Professor Pavlovdin, the director of the Institute of Physiology, overcoming philosophical idealism at the age of sixty, and Gide's Doctor Ettyingen in "The Vatican Cellars," although they also use science as a background, they are superior. Although this trend is not a healthy aspect of scientific literature, it is still above the horizontal line.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned methods of extracting principles, we must also promote scientific fantasy novels. These fantasy novels must rely on scientific experimental, realistic data. Gorky said, "The fantasy of ancient people without weapons has already foreseen the possibility of humans flying in the air, diving in the water, endlessly strengthening land sports, and transforming materials. In our era, fantasy and imagination rely on scientific experimental and realistic data. From this fantasy, the creative power of reason can be infinitely strengthened. We know that although inventors do not "very" understand mechanics, they are striving to create new ideal mechanical appliances. We need scientific literature to help children fantasize, to teach children to think about the future."</p>
<p>Regarding fantasy novels, works such as those by H.G. Wells are very good, but we must avoid committing scientific and professional errors, as well as exaggerated romantic elements and inclinations towards mysticism. For example, A. Yaroslavsky's "Cosmic Adventure of the Argo" in the Soviet Union committed these shortcomings.</p>
<p>Scientific literature not only teaches ordinary people to think about the future in this way, but also, most importantly, gives the general public a thorough understanding of the achievements of natural science in the past. Using the rational image of natural science to explain in a literary way gives religion a most favorable barrier, as "The New Testament" and others have fully utilized. We must also do so, but we must never learn from their absurdities, but rather make it non-mystical, and based on scientific practical explanations, give mankind a new popular knowledge.</p>
<p>The problem of mutual permeation between science and literature as mentioned above is by no means mechanically putting the content of natural science into literature, but rather turning natural science into an easy-to-understand material. Relying on literature can extensively cultivate the public. That is to say, literature digests the essence of natural science, and the two combine into one, reaping the effect of making human culture grow. This problem has now achieved good results in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>As for some people's advocacy of using natural science methods to deal with literature and describe creation, and that analysis of psychological inheritance can achieve success, I disagree. If so, Freud's psychoanalysis should become the best method in literature, but the opposite is true. Our progressive method is based on social science.</p>
<p>In short, the permeation of natural science and literature is not a question of method, but a question of how to address the theme.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Quick Sketch on a Rainy Night <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Wu</p>
<p>If Beethoven's (Beethoven) allegro symphony to describe the night's rain, is to proper no more. For life depressed. Develop a habit of wander alone on rainy days road without rain gear, silently picking up quiet roads to go, often find many subtle interesting wonderland, get body wet as tearful man back, almost is commonplace. That night, the heavy rain fell on the lamplight as if they were trembling, projecting strange brilliance. When I walked past the middle section of Avenue Haig, and glanced at the stone steps, flower pots, and window lattices in front of the Western-style residences with TOLET white paper strips, none of them looked like wonders bathing in the moonlight. Almost cried out, if it were not for the rain-like columns of rain pouring down without end, there would be no more vivid description. This makes one reminiscent of the gentle scene in the passionate comedy of the woman holding the lamp, and the environment of the fragrant boudoir court mentioned in old Chinese novels.</p>
<p>However, the wind blows the half-closed windows rattling, the inside dark as if something is lurking, mixed with a mood of loneliness and sadness, this seems not a gentle and beautiful environment. Another feeling of terror quickly attacked me, as if this abandoned house had the spirit in the poem "The House Lived In". In Percy Robinson's Whisper Side, he narrated the story of an artist going mad in a British seaside inn and strangling his wife. Perhaps this abandoned house had such strange things happened before. This, not to be carefully thought about further, is already chilling.</p>
<p>Returning home, it seemed that I could still hear the rattling of the windows, and still think of the bleak scene in front of the Western-style residences with TOLET white paper strips.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Distinguishing Characters and Distinguishing Words (4) <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Guest: So, according to you, the writing of modern youth is perfect and without any flaws?</p>
<p>Host: That's not entirely the case. Modern youth being more advanced than their predecessors is one thing, and their writing being perfect is another. Even now, there are still foolish people in Shanghai broadcasting the "Primer of Childlike Enlightenment." Not knowing how to distinguish characters is one thing, and distinguishing words is another. Before the Qin Dynasty, it was an era of using individual characters, and the work of distinguishing characters was extremely important. After the Qin and Han Dynasties, the focus shifted from using individual characters to using words. Simply focusing on distinguishing individual characters is of little use. If one doesn't seek the correct use of words but only seeks the correct distinction of characters, what benefit is there to the level of Chinese of young people? You said earlier, "Isn't this a degradation of the Chinese proficiency of young people?" The word "degradation" is misused. You think that "evolution" means "progress" and "degradation" means "regression," but that's completely wrong. The word "evolution" encompasses two meanings: one simply refers to the changes that come with the times, which is completely synonymous with "history" and "change." The other refers to the gradual change in the inherent qualities transmitted from ancestors to descendants; biological evolution means that the various animals and plants that exist today are the result of changes from various forms in the past. "Evolution" and "degradation" do not inherently imply becoming better or worse. When we distinguish the meaning of words, we should say, "Isn't this a regression of the Chinese proficiency of young people?" We cannot say, "Isn't this a degradation of the Chinese proficiency of young people?" The most ridiculous thing is the widespread use of the word "civilized." For marriages, there's "civilized marriage"; for haircuts, there's "civilized haircut"; for plays, there's "civilized new drama," and then there are "civilized methods," "civilized actions," etc. Everything is "civilized." If you ask about the meaning of the word "civilized," everyone is dumbfounded and doesn't know what to say. As far as I know, even specialized scholars have written books to explain the definition of "Wen Gong" and "civilization," but they still can't explain it clearly. Yet, a certificate, two introducers, a marriage officiant, a few flower baskets, and a military band are enough to call it a "civilized marriage." Isn't that a great farce under heaven! Chinese literati have long focused on distinguishing individual characters but not words, using allusions without knowing their original meaning. So, when new terms came from the West with capitalism, they were used indiscriminately without any consideration. As long as it came from afar, it was "foreign"—"foreign matches," "foreign oil," "foreign lamps," "foreign cars," "foreign dragons," "foreign dogs," etc. And as long as it was fashionable, it was "free," "hygienic," "humorous," or "modern"—"free cloth," "free wool," "hygienic stinky tofu," "hygienic clothing," "humorous perfume," "modern soap," etc. One day, a peddler selling Galgren's medicine was loudly advertising in a train car. He said, "Galgren's medicine can be used this way and that way. To promote our business, our company is selling it on the train at a special discount, only two small coins. Do you all approve or disapprove? Those who approve, buy a bottle and try it." His use of the word "approve" shows the poison of fashion and a lack of understanding of the meaning of "approve."</p>
<p>Guest: Old literati misuse new terms, which is certainly true. But surely, old literati use old terms more correctly?</p>
<p>Host: That's not necessarily the case! All the vague and generalized problems that modern youth commit are still inherited from the old literati. Zhang Shizhao ridiculed vernacular Chinese as inferior to classical Chinese, using the example of "two peaches kill three scholars" being more concise than "two peaches kill three brave men." Who knew that he himself didn't understand the original meaning of the "two peaches kill three brave men" allusion? Old literati loved to use the idiom "each situation goes downwards," thinking that it meant "each generation is worse than the last." Little did they know that Zhuangzi's original intention was the opposite. Old literati loved to use terms like "a du," "Ning Xin," "qi qi," "good weapons are inauspicious," "Haotian is not sympathetic." Little did they know that they didn't understand the original meaning at all and used them incorrectly. The habit of using allusions became increasingly prevalent after the Jian'an period. At that time, literati had neither dictionaries to consult nor encyclopedias to look up, relying mostly on memory. Those with strong memories were valued for their rich use of historical events. But memory is sometimes unreliable, and "using historical events" would lead to errors. Yan Zhitui's "Family Instructions" in the "Articles" section said: "The 'Later Han Dynasty Book' wrongly says that Situ Cui Lie was imprisoned with silver locks. 'Langdang' is a large lock. The world mistakenly wrote it as gold and silver letters. Prince Wu Lie was also a scholar of thousands of volumes and once wrote a poem: 'Silver locks on the feet of the three dukes, bumping into the heads of the secretaries.' This is a mistake made by the common people." There are many, many similar situations. Although later generations had encyclopedias, the method of checking was too inconvenient. Furthermore, the old literati were stubbornly old-fashioned and lazy, unwilling to put in the real effort. When the ancients used something incorrectly, it became a mistake passed down through generations. For example, Yan Zhitui distinguished the mistake of "Kong Huai" replacing "brothers." The reasoning is very clear, but old literati still used "friendly to brothers" and "Kong Huai" continuously. Terms like "established at thirty" and "unperturbed at forty" continued to increase without end. Another example is Han Yu's "Preface to Sending Meng Dongye Off": "Things cannot remain silent if they are not at peace." But the text below says, "In the time of Tang Yao and Yu Shun, Guitou and Yu used them, those who were good at crying out, and they lent them to" crying out. Kui relied on Shao to cry out; Yi Yao cried out in Yin, and the Duke of Zhou cried out in Zhou. It also says, "Heaven will harmonize its sound and make it cry out for the prosperity of the country." Clearly, it's self-contradictory and doesn't form a theory. Song Hong Rongzhai already knew it was a mistake. But I've seen old literati use this nonsensical sentence "Things cannot remain silent if they are not at peace" countless times.</p>
<h3 id="e232">On the Chao-Shan Road <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>Once again, I passed through the Chao-Shan Road.</p>
<p>A person coming from another country will have their mind confused by the currency system on this short stretch of the Chao-Shan Road. Only after exchanging foreign currency for "Shantou paper" in Shantou does a friend warn you that you need to exchange it for another type of currency, because the banknotes of Shantou bankers are not trusted inland. The flurry of silver coins spent and received when buying train tickets and shopping made this traveler, long separated from their hometown, unable to help but curse the inconvenience. After boarding the train, the bumps of this old vehicle were just like a ship encountering a storm, making one feel uncomfortable all over. Ah, Chao-Shan, which I have been away from for many years, these things you have left for returning wanderers are just like "ancient times."</p>
<p>However, looking out from the glass window, the appearance of the Chao-Shan Road has clearly changed somewhat. Although in the autumn fields, farmers are still working with their upper bodies bare, and under the old banyan trees in the ancient villages, by the dark ponds, women are still washing clothes and rice as before, tall bunkers have been built along the side of the village road.</p>
<p>"Now, bandits dare not invade the villages," an old overseas Chinese who had just returned to the country said with a smile, pointing to the blockhouse.</p>
<p>"No, now many of the villagers have become bandits!" a sincere old villager said, following with a long sigh.</p>
<p>Their conversation stopped. Two road-guarding soldiers passed through our train car.</p>
<p>Turning my eyes back outside the train. Under the blurry vision caused by the train's bumps, the black stones of Sangpu Mountain were still shining brightly in the heat, and the oranges in the orange groves were ripening redly.</p>
<p>Looking at the continuous mountain range of Sangpu Mountain, and its rugged face remaining the same, I thought that Chao-Shan should maintain its original cold dignity.</p>
<p>"I think the oranges won't be stalled due to the recession in Tianjin and Shanghai, right?" I silently prayed to the vast fields.</p>
<p>At the same time, a ragged and haggard farmer appeared on the small dirt road in the orange grove, leaving me with a deep phenomenon obtained from the last sight on the Chao-Shan Road.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Smile (5) <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Tang Xiru from English by Lawrence</p>
<p>They stretched out their hands in bewilderment; he looked for the door, but even as he walked away, he couldn't help but catch the afterglow of the black eyes of that sturdy nun, flashing with its eternal transience, and the smile ran across his face again. At the same time, his heart was thinking, he really wished he could hold her two small dark milky-white hands, like a pair of paired birds, moving affectionately in their sleeves.</p>
<p>He tried to bring his thoughts back to his own shortcomings, "It's my fault!" he shouted angrily to himself. But even as he shouted this sentence, he still felt something tickling beside his ribs, telling him; laugh!</p>
<p>The three women, left in this tall room, looked at each other, they raised their hands for a while, as if six small birds suddenly flew out of the leaves, and then put them down again.</p>
<p>"Poor soul," said the abbess sympathetically.</p>
<p>"Really. Really. Poor soul," the young nun called out with a kind of innocent, sharp emotion.</p>
<p>"Gia," said the pensive, far-sighted nun.</p>
<p>The abbess silently moved closer to the bed and bent her head over the face of the corpse.</p>
<p>"She seems to know, poor soul," she murmured. "Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>The three white-headed heads leaned together. They saw for the first time a shallow, comical wrinkle at the corner of Ophelia's mouth. They looked with a kind of excited strangeness.</p>
<p>"She has already seen him," said the young, terrified nun.</p>
<p>The abbess, with a graceful gesture, put the delicately embroidered cloth back on the cold face; they twirled their rosaries and mumbled a prayer for the dead soul. Then the abbess placed two candles on the candle wicks of the candlesticks, holding the candles firmly with her strong but soft hands.</p>
<p>The dark-skinned, sturdy nun sat down again with her little Bible. The other two moved lightly and quietly to the door and walked into the white, vast corridor, where many dark curtains floated softly and silently, like many black swans in a river. They suddenly hesitated. They saw a lonely male figure, wearing a melancholy coat, pacing in the cold place at the end of the corridor. The abbess suddenly quickened her pace.</p>
<p>Matthew saw them walking towards him, these framed faces, and the fat figures without hands, the young nun following a little behind.</p>
<p>"Forgive me, my mother," he said, as if he were on the street, "I dropped my hat somewhere..."</p>
<p>He made a desperate sweep with his arms, his face, no other man could be more devoid of a smile than he was. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e234">Saar Plebiscite <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Wufa</p>
<p>The Saar region originally belonged to Germany but was placed under international administration after the European War. The 13th is the date for the Saar citizens to freely vote and decide its future. The ballot lists three options: (1) Return to Germany, (2) Merge with France, (3) Maintain the status quo. Voters should mark an "X" next to their chosen option. This kind of free plebiscite is different from ordinary elections because it concerns the fate of the territory and the future of the European situation, making its significance extremely important.</p>
<p>Because the Saar has always been a German territory, the majority of residents are also German. Although there are anti-Hitler factions and opposition from some churches within Germany, considering the Nazi Party's meticulous arrangements and energetic efforts, a victory is likely. Assuming this vote's outcome and its potentially serious impact on the future of the European situation, deep speculation is unnecessary. However, one thing is noteworthy in this vote: the general public is unwilling to easily give up their national rights.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from Saarbrücken on the 13th, former German Chancellor Papen, along with his wife and two daughters, arrived early in the morning to vote, waiting in the crowd for ten minutes. The last to arrive today was a woman who traveled from Shanghai, passing through Siberia, spending sixteen days on the train, and arriving in Berlin this morning. She specially hired a plane to rush to vote. At that time, the whole city was covered in snow, and rumors of chaos were spreading in the sky, but the woman disregarded everything and went to vote. Just think about how important this kind of vote is.</p>
<p>Papen was once the German Chancellor, so he naturally has a deep concern for the issue of the Saar's affiliation. It is still understandable that he personally led his wife and daughters to vote. However, it is truly admirable that a certain woman traveled specifically from Shanghai, hired a plane in the heavy snow, and went to vote. Furthermore, the telegram only mentions "a certain woman" without detailing her surname, given name, or status. It can be imagined that this woman is not someone with a particularly superior identity. But her disregard for the long journey of thousands of miles and all losses to rush to vote shows how important she views the vote and, more clearly, how significant she considers the issue of the Saar's affiliation.</p>
<p>Assuming this happened in our country, what would our people think of this vote? Not to mention traveling tens of thousands of miles to cast a vote, even those nearby would probably give up their right to vote in this snowy weather, thinking that many people have already voted, so my single vote doesn't matter. Therefore, whether to vote or not doesn't matter. Our people lack a sense of national and ethnic identity. Unless it is closely related to their own interests, they will not easily lift a finger. This is often the case.</p>
<p>My statement is not without basis. Judging from the previous elections of provincial assembly members and members of parliament, it can be seen that voters mostly gave up their right to vote, which was generally taken over by a small number of people handling the elections. Their own vote has already entered the ballot box, but they still don't know who is being elected. Now, looking at the German people's fervent and serious attitude toward their civil voting rights, it is fitting that Germany, which almost perished after the European War, has shown signs of revival in less than twenty years.</p>
<h3 id="e235">One Year Older <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Buyang</p>
<p>After flipping through a one-and-a-half-inch thick calendar and escaping a silver-clad New Year's gate, people's age tags increase by one year.</p>
<p>Grandfather, staggering at sixty, is one year older.</p>
<p>Grandson, ignorant at six, is also one year older.</p>
<p>It was the eve of New Year's Day. The elderly grandfather, who also acted as a loving mother, found a blue cotton robe that his son used to wear to school from a purplish-brown bamboo box. He carefully held it up and examined it under the flickering candlelight. Although there were only a few ink stains on the front, and some mildew on the collar and cuffs, it was not torn. The few moth holes inside the lapel would not be noticed by others.</p>
<p>So, on New Year's Day, one could see the grandson, who usually wore tattered shorts, putting on the cotton robe that his grandfather had prepared for him last night, as if inheriting his father's position. Although other people's contemptuous attitude towards him had not changed, the grandfather, who also acted as a loving mother, had already exhausted all possible methods in his heart.</p>
<p>"Grandpa, the length is just right for me," the grandson asked with satisfaction, pointing to the cotton robe that was half a segment longer than before.</p>
<p>The grandfather's face wrinkled slightly, looking like he was smiling and not smiling at the same time. "You've grown a lot since last year."</p>
<p>"Look, in a few years, I'll be as tall as you."</p>
<p>Raising a hand reddened by the cold, he barely touched the grandfather's beard-covered chin.</p>
<p>Almost as tall as himself. A wave of joy climbed into the grandfather's heart. He stretched out a hand covered in blue veins and affectionately placed it on the small bald head. How anxiously he hoped that his grandson would grow up. If possible, he really wanted to add his own extra year to him.</p>
<p>Immediately, he felt that he was sixty-two years old. One year older, wasn't he one step closer to death?</p>
<p>The joy before his eyes was instantly crowded out of his mind by future worries. One hand unconsciously slid down from the bald head.</p>
<p>The grandson looked at the grandfather's wizened face like a dried chili pepper with bewilderment, turned his butt and walked away, feeling strangely bored.</p>
<p>"If I were to die now, undoubtedly, he would become a stray wild child on the streets, letting people bully him, letting wind and frost oppress him," he thought sadly, watching the grandson's departing figure.</p>
<p>He began to curse that the years had aged him.</p>
<p>But he couldn't help but happily welcome the years that would make his grandson grow taller. He had welcomed them several times before; that was when he was about to marry his wife, and he really hoped that time would pass doubly fast to bring his "good days" closer; and also, after he had a son. If his son were alive, he should be thirty years old this year. He wouldn't mistake that; he was born in the year of the horse. It was the year he made the most money. Because he had suffered many losses in his life from being illiterate, he decided to save money to send his son to school. From that day on, his family had one more student wearing long clothes. At the age of fourteen, he entrusted a distant relative to recommend him to work as an apprentice in a pawnshop in a town, and also found him a good wife. But unfortunately, not long after the grandson was born, the wife died of postpartum disease. Then the son also died in a summer when infectious diseases were prevalent. The grandfather and grandson lived alone like this until now.</p>
<p>Now he continues to sell his remaining labor while projecting the psychology of hoping for his son to grow up onto his grandson.</p>
<p>But he is old, and the rewards for labor are not as much as they were in his prime. He can no longer cultivate his grandson to attend school, and even wearing a long robe is still a remnant left by his son.</p>
<p>In his hope, the grandson has already learned to use his mouth to speak and use his legs to walk. The not-short seven years have made the grandson grow to his waist, and at the same time, a few more scars of life have been added to his forehead.</p>
<p>One year older, two different thoughts surged in the mind of the elderly grandfather who also acted as a loving mother.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Rabbit <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Wu</p>
<p>On Sunday, I took the child to the City God Temple. Seeing a pair of rabbits in the bird-selling area, he clamored to buy them back.</p>
<p>I originally liked small animals. When I was in the countryside, I spent all my time on my hobbies. The countryside has wide gardens and spacious courtyards. Besides growing all kinds of flowers, raising small animals is the best thing.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Almost every family has dogs and cats. These two animals cannot be regarded as pets in the countryside. They have joined the family group, so it is very common to find cats and dogs proudly perched on the ridge of a moving car.</p>
<p>Naturally, my family also had them.</p>
<p>One dog was a mixed breed. I don't remember its origin. It could guard the house like an ordinary dog and help me hunt. It was already the best dog in the countryside. It was always the leader when many dogs gathered. Sometimes when they fought, the dog owners would often come to my door.</p>
<p>Speaking of cats, it was a very lovely one. It didn't steal food and was diligent in catching mice. When I was reading and writing, when I lit a stick of incense, it was as effective as a talisman. I didn't have to call it. It would squat on the desk like a Maitreya Buddha, staring at me. If I didn't tell it to leave, it wouldn't jump down no matter what.</p>
<p>Once, my friend came to the countryside. I told him this trick. He didn't believe it. When he tried to catch it, it scratched him in several places, but he still didn't catch it.</p>
<p>Enough with the digression. What I want to write about is my experience raising rabbits in the countryside. Country people especially value rabbits. They are unwilling to give them away unless they are close relatives and good friends, so getting ten pairs of rabbits was a very good opportunity.</p>
<p>It was my tenant. Because they found work in Nanjing, the whole family moved. They gave away many bulky broken pieces of furniture to the neighbors, and because of the relationship between the landlord and tenant of more than ten years, I enjoyed the priority for the ten pairs of rabbits.</p>
<p>I built a small house in the backyard and picked a lot of vegetable leaves to supply them. However, a difficult problem arose. Rabbits are the most timid animals. It is said that they will tremble and die when they see fresh blood. I can still forbid my cat from barging into the backyard, but if that mixed-breed wolfdog that knew we had killed a wild duck and dragged it back dared to barge into the backyard with its furry face, ten pairs of rabbits would be twelve corpses.</p>
<p>According to my mother's idea, we should give away that dog, but I was a little reluctant to lose this hunting companion. I didn't listen to my mother and locked it with a chain, and I especially told my family to be careful to prevent it from going wild.</p>
<p>The first two months were peaceful, but one time when I came back from hunting, I bought a few beef buns to feed it and forgot to lock it up immediately. Within three minutes, it had chewed up two rabbits.</p>
<p>The bloody scene made me feel very sorry for the other eight pairs. My mother loved animals as if they were her own children. She angrily beat the dog and ordered my family's servant to take it to my uncle's house ten miles away.</p>
<p>So it was peaceful. The little rabbits were also born. The backyard, except for a few fruit trees, was their world. White bodies, red eyes, leaping among the green grass. My younger brother often played with them, getting his whole body covered in mud.</p>
<p>Now it has been three years since I left my hometown. Although my younger brother always mentioned a lot about rabbits in his letters, he told me that after I left, the cat also barged into the backyard once and was sent to the back village by my mother.</p>
<p>Now in Shanghai, where every inch of land is precious, this pair of rabbits bought from the City God Temple simply has no place to play, and foreign invasions can happen anytime and anywhere. In desperation, I keep them in cages in the bedroom, not knowing how long their lives can be sustained.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Night in a Small Inn <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Ruowang</p>
<p>It's late at night, weary travelers, take a rest</p>
<p>Dragging a pair of soaking wet clumsy feet in the snow. A dark figure stepped into a small inn that no one noticed. The innkeeper, seeing a guest come, raised his voice and called out;</p>
<p>"We have a guest!"</p>
<p>This kind of cry with welcoming undertones should have been happy, but I looked at the small room doors one by one with a frown.</p>
<p>"Sir, is this room small enough?"</p>
<p>"Is there a smaller one?"</p>
<p>I stayed in the smallest room in the small inn. The electric light was shared with the room next door, and it was very dim, but the dirtiness of the bed curtains could still be distinguished. Seeing the large patch of water on the mattress, I subconsciously felt that this mattress had a rich experience.</p>
<p>Lying on the bed, there was no warm grass underneath, and the quilt on top was also lumpy. Covering myself with it, I felt that the quilt was made of pebbles. After tossing and turning a few times, I couldn't find a place with more warmth.</p>
<p>The small inn was very quiet. The innkeeper's cry of "We have a guest" was like being near my ears, and the sound of footsteps running on the stairs seemed to shake my bed. I couldn't help but feel annoyed. One unpleasant thing after another flashed before my eyes—the stern face of the boss, the ruthlessness of the landlord... Unemployed people are like iron balls in a golf ball tray, complaining, getting annoyed, hating, cursing, trembling...</p>

<p>Suddenly, a person walked into the room next door, fidgeting with the paper on the walls all by himself, idly whistling a tune. Before long, a peddler of chapbooks went into the next room. It was the first time I had heard the voice of the man next door, haughtily saying, “I’m tired of looking at these bird books!”</p>
<p>“Buy one to kill time, sir. I also have erotic pictures.”</p>
<p>“Don’t want it, don’t want it,” the man said.</p>
<p>There was a moment of quiet.</p>
<p>“Customer, would you like to buy some melon seeds? Spiced melon seeds!” a woman selling melon seeds shouted as she walked into the room next door. The man didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“Grab some to eat. It’s too quiet living alone.”</p>
<p>“Don’t grab. I don’t know how to eat this stuff.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t know how, I’ll peel them for you to eat.”</p>
<p>Again, there was a moment of quiet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the woman selling melon seeds shouted, flustered.</p>
<p>“That won’t do. I have a man at home. Don’t” want you touching me. Her voice was slightly trembling and a little angry.</p>
<p>The sound of someone being slapped.</p>
<p>“Don’t pretend to be righteous. Sit here and chat. It’s very cold outside,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Chat about what? Buy if you want to buy, leave if you don’t,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Who’s waiting for you? Why are you in such a hurry? You’ll still get paid, but you have to sit here for a bit.”</p>
<p>They didn’t know there was someone living next door listening to them, behaving so brazenly!</p>
<p>“Don’t let others see. It’s embarrassing,” the woman said; apparently, both parties were close to reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>Then, the door of the next room slammed shut.</p>
<p>I never thought Barbuss’s “Hell” would be reenacted here. I put on my soaking wet pants and hurried to change rooms, moving to a larger one at the very end, furthest away from them. Once again, everything was quiet, and I could hear the sound of melting snow dripping from the roof tiles.</p>
<p>But the quilt was still very cold. Listening to the clock strike, I couldn’t fall asleep even with my eyes tightly shut. So, resentment, vexation, and curses arose in my heart…</p>
<p>Just as I was about to fall asleep, someone lightly knocked on the door again.</p>
<p>“Who is it!”</p>
<p>“Customer, would you like to buy some melon seeds?” It was a woman’s voice. I didn’t even bother to answer her, burying my head in the smelly quilt.</p>
<p>At that moment, I thought of Barbuss’s “Hell” again, and thought of what we call “humanity.”</p>

<p>Opening Chapter: "Tears of Longing"</p>
<p>A beautiful woman is ill in the west chamber. Remembering the past dream of plum blossoms. Seeing the rain and flowers falling like snow, her heart is chaotic. Having no mood to embroider a sachet. Remembering the day of admiring each other on the hundred flower platform. Remembering the second plum blossom telling of a loving heart. Remembering the day the scholar entered the inner chamber in the red-powder boudoir. Remembering discussing couplets together in the Liaozhai. Remembering traveling in spring together to the Pearl Pagoda. Remembering laughter fragrant in the moonlit red building. He gave me a bi jade kui dragon sparkling. I gave him a gilded phoenix, a perfect pair. He loves my jade dragonfly flying lightly. I love his handsome samurai robe with an air of pride. He compares me to the heroine Thirteen Sisters. I compare him to the Little Tang Lang in "A Laughing Marriage." Since the golden fan fell and misfortune arose. Tears follow the double pearl phoenix separated from the male. Not to mention the possibility of continuing the "Rebirth Love Story." Nine silk threads cannot bring back the loving man. Moreover, the beautiful woman is by nature heroic and upright. Yang Naiwu's doctor cannot think of a life-extending soup. Alas, the peerless flower of freedom. Today in the golden storm and rain only desolation remains. The predestined relationship of twin butterflies is severed.</p>

<p>Don't gamble when you have free time. When the money is gone, you stare at the blue sky. The sky does not pity, people do not cherish. How can you be obsessed in a moment? Always losing without winning. Everywhere, everyone's heart is evil. Instead of being cunning, it's better to stop. Scratching an itch can still last a few years. Every year, losing families issue IOUs. Leaving the house, they sell the fields. The fields are not sold by the winning family. The person selling the property has little money. Money comes and goes, they run tirelessly. Bitterly cherishing the fact that there isn't half a coin in their bag. Former events are told to future people.</p>

<p>The setting sun shines on the village. Cattle and sheep return to the poor lane. The old man thinks of the shepherd boy,</p>

<p>In the evening, she became a Wu palace concubine. On humble days, was she any different from the crowd? When valued, one realizes how rare.</p>
<p>Inviting others to apply fragrant powder, not wearing silk clothes oneself. The more the ruler favors, the more arrogant the attitude,</p>
<p>The more the ruler pities, the less right and wrong are distinguished. Her companions from washing silk back then, could not return by carriage.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Hollywood Astrologer Dareos’ Predictions for 1935 (Part 1) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Hollywood stars’ astrologer, Dareos, is once again releasing his annual predictions.</p>
<p>People in Hollywood have known his predictions to be "highly accurate" for the past four years. He has predicted signs of marriage, children, death, divorce, etc. He has also announced in advance the ups and downs in the careers or personal lives of major stars. It is said that his predictions have all been confirmed later. We are not promoting superstition, but many stars in Hollywood, although their superstition is not as deep as that of ordinary Chinese people, deeply believe in this great prophet Dareos. I remember that Shen Bao's film supplement also published stories about Dareos' predictions in the past. Now, for the interest of readers, I will describe his predictions for this year again.</p>
<p>It is said that many film producers in Hollywood must consult with Dareos before making an important attempt before deciding whether to proceed. There are also many stars – both men and women – who regularly visit Dareos' home. They are "part of the family" in Dareos' home. Therefore, Dareos knows everything about them, their hopes, their plans, their dreams, and their secrets. Dareos uses this deep understanding, plus what is displayed in the stars and what is manifested in the crystal ball, to judge their future fortunes. Of course, there are many tricks of the trade involved, but at least it is closer to understanding than our blind fortune tellers who arrange birthdates and calculate annual luck.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, 1934, he announced all the major future events in the Hollywood film industry. He announced a total of 61 predictions, of which 47 were confirmed, only two were wrong, and the remaining 12 have not yet been resolved, and it is unknown whether they are accurate. For example, Dareos predicted that in 1934, two female stars, one white and one black, would divorce their husbands. As a result, the white woman was Jean Harlow, and the black woman was Carole Frances, both of whom divorced their husbands. Dareos also said that in 1934, three lovely stars would die. As a result, Marie Dressler, Liliane Tashman, and Russ Columbo all died one after another. He also predicted that Liliane Tashman would meet with an unexpected disaster, and she indeed died in a car accident. According to statistics from Hollywood film magazines, 70% of everything Dareos said was accurate, 30% was wrong, and the remaining 20% had no result.</p>
<p>Now, this astrologer is back to predict all the major events in the film industry this year. Even if we don't believe it, we can listen to it as a rumor. His predictions for this year are:</p>
<p>In 1935, three lovely big stars will encounter tragedies and lose their lives.</p>
<p>England and "television" will make Hollywood feel strong competition this year. "Television" will have rapid progress this year and will invade the film industry. The British film industry will also rise without limit, making Hollywood feel extremely uneasy. Furthermore, many American movie stars will also leave Hollywood and submit to Britain.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy will become a red star in 1935. Joan Crawford will get married this year. Janet Gaynor will also remarry. Carole Lombard will too. Greta Garbo will return to Sweden because her mother is seriously ill, and soon her mother will die. Her own health will also be greatly affected afterwards. Although she will leave MGM and set up a company to make films independently, her former glory will decline day by day and will never be restored. Garbo will not have any romantic or marital entanglements this year.</p>
<p>John Barrymore's family will encounter misfortune this year and will be robbed. According to the stars, John Barrymore will have a strange disaster this year, either on his private yacht or under the wheels of a car. John Barrymore will have a huge British film break. His family life will remain harmonious and unremarkable.</p>
<p>Leon Barrymore's wife will become seriously ill this year and will be on the verge of danger. Leon's own health will also decline, and he may suffer from paralysis. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e244">Review of "Gambling" <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Gambling, drinking, rivalry, jealousy, murder, accusation, suicide, revelry, a series of crimes such as debauchery and violence, robbery and fighting, are constantly being staged in a corrupt and decadent society. At the same time, they are reflected on the screen by most film producers without criticism or abandonment, serving as entertainment for stimulation and enjoyment for the general public, even those who personally participate in them to varying degrees.</p>
<p>"Gambling" is this kind of film made in such an attitude and with such materials.</p>
<p>Centered on the love killing case of the goddaughter of Dou Bo, the owner of a New York gambling house, it connects the lives of enjoyment and depravity of a group of idle "beautiful people." Shallow, empty, and vulgar from beginning to end, from structure to performance.</p>
<p>"Gambling" in the United States is said to have been a successful stage play starring Geoff 3 Gem Gambling, and he also became famous for playing it. However, this "Gambling", which is reflected on the screen through the eagle eyes of the camera, is obviously smart enough. Naturally, there are some differences between stage art and film art.</p>
<p>Director Rowland V. Lee's use of a sluggish tone to deal with the whole film is a big failure. Although there are some individual shots, dialogues, atmosphere, etc. that are quite beautiful, they cannot have their extra effect alone. As for the fact that the death of Vina, the victim in the murder case, is written too vaguely, reducing the serious emotions and atmosphere in the development of the whole play, and the use of unnecessary insertions to blur the description of personality and psychology, etc., it especially damages the rigor of the whole film.</p>
<p>The casting of the personalities and figures of the two female characters is quite good, and Wynne Gibson, who plays Maggie, is also better.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e245">Opinions After Watching "The Road" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Hui</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is a work that grasps reality, although in many places, the author abandons reality and focuses on the ideal. However, in any case, that excellent style, full of enthusiasm, excitement, magnificence, and the emotions of the anti-imperialist movement, we all deserve to praise.</p>
<p>The director can be said to be extremely successful in this film, such as the six road workers being flogged by the local tyrant, Jin Ge cutting the ropes with his toes in preparation for escape, the tension, and Hong Jingling being teased in the rice shop and temple show, which is laughable. In the first half of the film, which is very difficult to please, the author inserted a lot of gimmicks, making the entire atmosphere of the play not feel boring and dull, but feel pleasant and relaxed. Here, we cannot but say that Sun Yu's ingenuity is unique.</p>
<p>Speaking of the actors, the author has grasped the personality of each person to the fullest, Jin Yan's elegance, Zhang Yi's silent and decisive courage, Yizhi Zhi's coarseness, and Li Lili's frivolousness are all brought to the fullest. Especially "Han Lingen's" "gimmick" helped the play achieve a harvest without being boring.</p>
<p>Other aspects such as the beauty, greatness, and lightness of the screen, the clarity of the photography, and the magnificent song also added a lot to the climax of the play.</p>

<p>…Hu Die could not be tolerated in her family, so she resolutely walked out, and her family thought she was hit by a train and killed, but the one who died was actually the maid Cui'er. A few years later, when her son stood in front of her and pointed to her photo and said; "This is the portrait of my loving mother" Hu Die's heart was moved, and tears flowed down, but fearing that others would notice, she still forced a smile. Hu Die's performance here is pure and perfect, this kind of emotional change. In terms of expression, it is the most difficult to perform, if you don't believe me, please try it in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>…Old Gao's wife was unfortunately hit and killed by a train, and she cried loudly while stroking the body. When filming this scene, it happened to be when Little Gao was present, and she didn't know how she blurted out this sentence. "Crying so sadly, it really looks like she's dead…" The whole audience burst into laughter, and Little Gao suddenly shouted that she had been tricked. (Que)</p>

<p>▲ Yi Hua held an administrative meeting the other day, and all the important personnel of the company attended, and many resolutions were passed.</p>
<p>▲ The fragment of "The Beginning of Man" directed by Shi Dongshan, which was filmed during the "Grand Sound Film Exercise," achieved very excellent results after the trial screening. Therefore, he has been working very hard recently.</p>
<p>▲ The big fat Guan Hongda has officially joined Yi Hua Company and is playing an important role in Shi Dongshan's film "The Beginning of Man."</p>
<p>▲ The music and singing film (Elegy of Life) directed by Hu Rui, starring Li Minghui, Wang Yin, Hu Ping, and Wang Naidong, has been sent to Beijing for inspection and will be released around the 20th of this month. This film has achieved very excellent results, and the acting skills of Li Minghui, Wang Yin, Hu Ping, Wang Naidong, etc., have made great progress.</p>
<p>▲ Bu Wancang is about to direct the sound film (Triumphal Song), and Yuan Meiyun is one of the heroines of this film, and Bu Wancang and Yuan Meiyun are still collaborating for the first time.</p>
<p>▲ However, Cheng Yu's sound dialogue film (The Night Before the Wedding Night) is about to be completed. Xu Canying, one of the five tigers of the Mei Hua Singing and Dancing Troupe, who is famous for her grass skirt dance, is also one of the heroines, playing the role of Dr. Li Amao's daughter.</p>
<p>▲ Yi Hua's business department has been receiving dozens of letters from theaters in the mainland every day in recent months, requesting to rent and screen films. From this, it can be seen that Yi Hua's productions are popular, mainly due to the excellent quality of Yi Hua's productions.</p>

<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>After everyone dispersed, Jeffrey, Sheber, and Dielun rode in the same car. After Dielun returned to his apartment, Jeffrey and Sheber also went back to their respective homes. When Dielun arrived at his apartment, he cheerfully sang while taking a bath. He thought to himself that this was a happy day, and that Manli was the most beautiful woman there could be. When he finished his bath, and his servant Zhuang Sheng handed him a towel, he felt that his future was stable and secure. He also recalled that night when he told her that he had never loved a woman as much as he loved Manli now. Manli extended a slender finger, pressed it against his lips, and said, "Dielun, you don't need to say that. Isn't there also a Connie... didn't you love her too, and live with her for six months?"</p>
<p>Dielun said, "Manli, that can only be considered something done in my youth, it doesn't count. Everyone has to go through that stage. Connie... Denny... Susie... Wu Qian... they don't matter. Really, Manli, they were just experiences, and you are true love." Manli, after being coaxed with such sweet words, believed him and had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>After Dielun finished his bath, he hummed a tango tune contentedly and left the bathroom, running into his bedroom. He called out to his servant, "Zhuang Sheng! Where did you go again? I'm not playing hide-and-seek with you, why do you always hide?" As soon as he called out, someone knocked on the door from outside. So, he shouted as if he were acting in a play, "Zhuang Sheng, come in! I'm telling you, I'm the happiest person in the world! After my happy days are over, I'll find a woman for you too!"</p>
<p>Just as he was talking to himself, the door opened, but the person who came in was not his servant, but a woman, Connie Barney, still with that disheveled hair, drowsy eyes, and charming dimples. Dielun first saw her in the mirror. At first, he didn't believe his own eyes, and he immediately turned around to face her. He smiled unceremoniously, pushed her out of the bedroom, and into the living room. But he seemed to be hypnotized, and he still followed behind her, following her into the living room. He stared at her with both eyes, as if he were mesmerized by a rattlesnake. Connie kept smiling charmingly at him.</p>
<p>She took a step closer to Dielun and said with a smile, "What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?" Dielun unconsciously took a step back and said, "Please leave this place! You can't come here!" Connie was still smiling, her charming eyes half-closed, looking sleepy. She feigned a languid voice and said, "Oh, Dielun, my darling, I can't bear it anymore. How can I leave you? I was so stupid to let you go. Only after you left did I realize that I deeply love you...</p>
<p>...I only love you!"</p>
<p>Dielun said, "But I'm getting married tomorrow!" His voice was almost a shout. "Connie, don't you know that?" Connie widened her eyes, feigning a look of fear, and said, "Dielun! Really? How can that be! ...I don't understand what you're saying!" She started babbling and fussing like this, her voice getting higher and higher. Finally, she shouted, "I came here to tell you how much I hate you, detest you, loathe you, you shameless thing! Whoever marries you, she has my sympathy!" Dielun also shouted, "Okay! You've told me! Now get out of here! Otherwise, I might just throw you out!" As he said this, he turned around and walked into the bedroom, slamming the door shut with a loud bang. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e250">Progress of Domestic Building Materials in Recent Years (Part 2) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Cixin</p>
<p>(V) Steel Windows: The use of steel windows in buildings in our country has only a history of a little over ten years. At that time, everything used was foreign goods. In recent years, sales have increased daily, and domestic manufacturers have begun to set up factories to manufacture them. Although the steel materials still belong to foreign goods, the assembly and manufacturing are all done by Chinese. The price is also cheaper than completely imported goods. However, there are still many aspects of the work that need to be improved. It is hoped that steel window manufacturers will improve in terms of work and parts distribution in the future to strive for excellence. It can be seen that the future of domestic steel windows is bright.</p>
<p>(VI) Door Locks: Door locks used to be foreign goods, and even domestic goods were simple. In recent years, Chinese-made door locks have begun to appear. The appearance is as beautiful as imported products and can almost be mistaken for the real thing. Although some of the parts must be obtained from abroad, if one can strive for perfection, it is not impossible to seize the market. Other hardware materials are also increasing daily with domestic goods, and the materials are all applicable. It cannot be said that it is not a promising industry in domestic building materials.</p>
<p>(VII) Nails: The original iron nails in our country were made by hand. They were crude and not suitable for today's architecture. Therefore, the so-called foreign nails can be seen everywhere. Even the smallest nail has to rely on foreign goods, which is regrettable. Fortunately, in recent years, factories have been established to manufacture domestic nails. Although the raw materials still need to be imported due to the lack of a steel industry, the products made in the country are strong, round, and complete, and can be used. If the manufacturing is continuously improved and persevered, and the output is gradually expanded, it is also an expected thing to rise up and seize the market for foreign nails.</p>
<p>(VIII) Conclusion: The progress of domestic building materials in recent years has only been like this. Think about the main materials in construction, such as steel and wood, are there any domestic products that can replace imported products? Our country has always had wood, but large timbers have to be foreign pine. The variety of colors is also beyond the reach of our country's wood. Although foreign wood has to be transported to our country across the ocean, it is more economical and convenient than domestic goods because it is suitable for obtaining materials. Therefore, there is almost no day when foreign wood can be replaced. Looking back at our country's cultivation of forests, the government has not paid attention to it from the beginning. The difficulty of transportation is even more difficult than traveling across the ocean. Such a big loophole cannot be remedied, which is also regrettable. As for steel, it is even more impossible not to rely on foreign goods. Today's tall buildings and pavilions are built with steel and are all foreign goods. Steel-reinforced concrete uses steel, which is also all foreign goods. Although steel bars and angle iron have been manufactured in China for a time, they were eventually discontinued due to failure. It is hoped that today's strategists will actively manage the basic materials of steel and wood in architecture. Its importance is not limited to a corner of architecture; it is also of great importance to national defense and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Domestic building materials have made considerable progress in recent years. However, it is still in its infancy. Future progress depends more on the maintenance of the Chinese people. It has been seen that Japanese and European and American architects and engineers always specify the use of their own country's materials in their specifications, even when they are abroad. Is it that their own country's goods must be superior to foreign goods? The relationship between national economy and people's livelihood must be given special maintenance and promotion. Because domestic goods in our country have only made considerable progress in recent years, they cannot reach a perfect level. In addition, most of the architects and engineers in our country are students who have studied in Europe and the United States. They are accustomed to the materials of their country. Therefore, when selecting materials, they often take a skeptical attitude towards domestic goods because of their newness, and they feel that foreign goods are usable because they are accustomed to them, so they fail to fully promote the ability of domestic goods. Therefore, whether domestic building materials can be developed in the future, one cannot but hope for the manufacturers themselves to strive for perfection, and even more cannot but hope for the special maintenance of architects and engineers in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Architectural Jargon (3) <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>I. Regarding things used on the building site:</p>
<p>(Regarding shrinkage, a correction can be found in the 101st issue of this journal. Wood is prone to shrink when dry and swell when wet. The previous statement was erroneous and should be corrected immediately.)</p>
<p>Yangjiao (Exterior corner): The exposed wall. The place where the corners meet. That is Yangjiao. Inside the house it is called Yinjiao (Internal corner).</p>
<p>Muxie (Floated): This is like an old hen. It is not a crab in the animal kingdom. It is a rectangular piece of wood used by plasterers when plastering cement. (About four or five inches wide and seven or eight inches long.) (It is a tool for rubbing the cement surface to make it smooth and clean.)</p>
<p>Xuejiao (Shoe): The lower end of the downpipe (Downpipe) and the place close to the surface drain (Surfacedrain). It protrudes like a mouth. Water leaks out from there. This is called Xuejiao.</p>
<p>Jiaoshou: On the construction site, there is always a chaotic situation. Sometimes the ground is piled up with materials such as wood or bricks, making it impossible to walk. A piece of two-inch by twelve-inch Oregon pine (Oreginpine) board is placed in this place to facilitate transportation. This is Jiaoshou (Scaffolding). The bamboo scaffolding erected during the construction of ordinary buildings is also called Jiaoshou.</p>
<p>Tiema (Floorclamp): When carpenters are laying floorboards (a kind of one-inch six-inch or one-inch four-inch tongue-and-groove board), the first thing to pay attention to is the looseness of the floorboards and the discovery of fine seams. At this time, Tiema is used to make them tightly arranged. Its shape is like the phonetic symbol ㄇ. When using it, knock the sharp ends on the joists, then lay the floorboards, close the tongue and groove, and then gradually tighten them with a triangular wooden wedge.</p>
<p>Modou (Inkcup): Modou (Inkcup) is a tool used by carpenters to snap ink lines.</p>
<p>Suojie (Socket): Suojie (Socket) is the joint of a water pipe (Water pipe).</p>
<h3 id="e252">My View of the Future of Our Architectural Community in the Midst of Construction <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Guilin</p>
<p>The construction industry is the central system of all construction. Whether it is food, clothing, housing, or transportation, it is directly or indirectly related to construction. Therefore, if you want to know the strength or weakness of a country, you can use construction as a measure. If you want to understand the precision or crudeness of construction, you can use architecture as a divination. The 20th century is an era of material civilization. The so-called material civilization relies entirely on architecture to maintain it. Everything, such as the dredging of rivers, requires construction. The opening up of roads requires construction. The construction of seaports requires construction. The laying of railways requires construction. Other examples include factory construction, farm construction, wharf construction, bridge construction, warehouse construction, office building construction, business development construction, and all other kinds of undertakings require construction. Not only that, but the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, the infusion of culture, and the convenience of transportation all depend on the development of the construction industry. The mission undertaken by the construction industry is so important and great. In today's world, construction comes first. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, our country has suffered from foreign insults and internal turmoil, resulting in immature construction, economic exhaustion, people's livelihood decline, and the decline of national power. When the National Revolutionary Army settled the whole country, the government authorities, in view of the importance of construction, advocated it with great effort. The news media also saw the great relationship of construction and publicized it in many ways. And our architectural community knows even more deeply the importance of the mission it is related to and can still do its job. In this way, with the support of the upper and lower levels, it can be seen that all construction in our country will become more prosperous day by day, and our architectural industry will also prosper.</p>
