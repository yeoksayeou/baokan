<p>— 磬</p>
<p>最近廠商之聯合營業。者先有中華。上海兩軟管廠之設立聯合營業所。近者又有大中華·正大·中國·通燧·淮上·大華·民生·大明·八火柴公司之合組國產火柴製造同業聯合辦事處。集中辦理產銷事宜。查此兩者之聯營目的。在於消弭同業間之非法貶價競爭。兼事生產調劑。可以斷言。蓋同業競爭之結果。資力較充者。雖可仗其優勢。設法撲滅弱小同業。謀市塲之獨占。實則以我國現狀而論。此種雄圖殆非事實所許。良以小廠之此仆彼興。無時或已一一應付。不特損失過巨。或且難籌一鼓蕩平之良策。終至筋疲力盡。兩敗俱傷。徒資他人乘機漁利耳。</p>
<p>嘗考我國企業界之聯合營業。不乏先例。而以航業界行之最久。其中外合作者。早則如長江公票局。川江水脚同盟等皆是。均已成過去之史蹟。最近長江六公司營業公攤。殆為最新之演出。至內國航綫之賴聯合營業以為支持。亦復不少。如申台綫（上海至海門）台州·舟山·平安·穿山·達興·益利六公司之合組聯合航務公局。申沙綫（上海至啟束）大達·聚豐·達興·平安·裕興·五公司之合組滬啟航運合作社。申揚綫（上海至揚州）大達大。通兩公司之營業公攤。曁達通小輪公局之合設等皆是。至若工業方面。前此曾一度聯合者。有搪瓷。水泥等業。後皆因故而重吿解約。目前維待聯合營業局面者。除軟管。火柴兩業外。尙有鋼精。紙版。電扇。等三業。中以國產紙版業成效最著。自經採取聯營策略後。各廠營業。皆呈空前之紀錄。誠値得我人稱道焉。</p>
<p>抑聯合營業之目的。在期同業之共存共榮。至為明顯。其團結之初。必感於已往競爭之苦痛。始謀通力合作共訂營業公約。整飭同業陣綫。然而就聯合營業之失敗史一加觀察。其失敗原因。由於少數廠商之毁約競爭者固屬不少。間亦有主事者別具野心。以聯合營業為號召。以聯營機關為工具。陰謀營業之獨占。於是營業攤派未能公允。業務興替以私利為轉移。徒增參加廠商之担負。而無裨於實際。受其盤剝者。當時以公約所限。忍痛接受。一旦合約屆滿。安能望其賡續。於是同業競爭之釁。再度重開矣。是故聯合營業之最大困難。非在公約之成功。而在合作之如何以謀持久。至持久之先决條件。則在主事者之摒除私見私利。一切以事業為前提。公約信條。固須信守不渝。營業策略。更宜開誠布公。共籌應付。否則聯合營業。卽得暫吿成功。而日後同業間之隙痕。反由此造成矣。</p>

<p>六月二十八日、本市市參議會議决各案、其中關於公用建設者、有普遍供給水電、遷移滬南垃圾碼頭糞碼頭·及籌供煤氣，等三件、昨據徐局長語往訪者云、觀察此次市參議食議决各案、足徵參議會諸君、對於本市公用建設關懷之切、且所提各案、均極扼要、殊深欽佩、關於</p>
<p>普遍供給水電案本局對於水電行政標示之施政方針、為普遍供給、年來漸次推廣、成效尙有可觀、，在市區內供給自來水之公司、共有二家、即閘北水電公司、與內地自來水公司、各有營業區域、前年公用局因市區之內、尙有許多地方、並不在該兩公司營業區域之內、於是設立市辦給水處、籌劃供給、現在徐家匯等處、已經由公用局給水處供給、至於目前市內未有自來水供給之處、此較重要者、尙有浦東各區及吳淞眞一如等處、浦東方面、在一二八事變之前、公用局已計劃自設水廠、圖樣及基地、均已選購定妥、因國難暫吿停止、去年復積極推進、已定本年四月內出水、旋山吳市長决定、交山興業信託社承辦、現正由該社建造水廠、吳淞現已劃歸閘北水電公司經營、水管已通至吳淞鎭至於眞如方面、自來水供給、茲已由公用局、令飭閘北公司計劃、大約不久當有辦法、關於電氣供給、在量的方面、現在已甚普遍、至質的方面、閘北水電公司之發電量、與供電量、相差尙多、已由公用局令飭該公司計劃添購發電機、以資供給、關於、</p>
<p>遷移滬南垃圾碼頭糞碼頭案　滬南碼頭區域內、有糞碼頭二座、垃圾碼頭一座、此項碼頭、用以傾倒垃圾及糞　入船、關於一般衛生、甚形重要、惟該處一帶、現為輪埠熱鬧區域、為改良市容·便捷交通·及繁榮市面起見、自應探地遷移、在民國十八年、港務局時代、曾有遷移糞碼頭會議、當經議决、定於必要時、須另覓地點遷讓、二十年、公用局曾函請衛生局、設法遷移、二十一年、公用局會呈請市政府遷移、均以遷往地點、以及重造碼頭經費兩問題、未能解决、以致久未實行、即如本年公用局、亦曾奉令召集會議、决定將垃圾碼頭、遷至董渡以南頓義碼頭附近、案經成立、一俟衛生工務二局領得建築費、即可興工、今次參議會旣通過請遷移南南糞碼頭及垃圾碼頭之議决案、在公用局立塲、深望其早能實行也、關於</p>
<p>供給煤氣案　市內煤氣供給、確有需要、在市政府未成立前、閘北滬西等處、爲上海自來火公司越界供給者頗多、公用局成立後、為尊重主權起見、即與該公司交涉、最後、該公司表示願向本市年繳營業稅·土地使用費·並繳納保證金、曁遵照本市掘路規則埋放管綫、等要點、爰於十九年一月、與該公司訂立合約、以資監督、乃自合約簽訂以來、各該處煤氣用戶、日有增加、近者滬南方面、對於煤氣供給、亦甚需要、在公用局意見、如有本國國民願投資創辦煤氣廠、市府自當予以協助、故於允准上海自來火公司、在市區內供給煤氣合同內訂明、本市區內、自設煤氣廠時、該公司在本市區內營業權、應即停止、惟年來市庫旣極支絀、無力舉辦、而工商百業、又極凋敝、故亦無人投資、於是官辦商辦、一時均難舉辦、想亦為全體市民所深知也、</p>

<p>閘北慈善團收養所之女、其中十八人、以已届擇配年限、爰於本月一日、開始辦理求　人士之登記以來、次日即吿滿額等情、均誌報端、關於雙方考慮結果、是否已均締結良緣、即無下文、大通社記者、茲探誌其顚末於后、</p>
<p>求偶人歷略　此次登記求偶人士之十八人中、計商十四人、工二人、自創事業者二人、年齡最大不過三十歲、據其每月收入生活費而言、最多為一一十五元、最少為十五元、以二十元為普通、其中三名、則屬續絃、籍貫以隸江浙兩省者居多數、</p>
<p>作簡單談話　該團自於一月開始辦理登記手續後、以次日即吿額滿、乃於三日分作上下午、由正副管理員朱錢·二女士、介紹男女雙方、在所內覿面、並作簡單談話、惟此時男女、均呈頳色、大都均由管理員代為傳話、</p>
<p>十六對無綠　照該團定章、於雙方覿面之日算起、過三天後、男女雙方、均須向該團監察報吿考慮結果、以定取捨、故截至昨日止、該團已得雙方全部報吿、十八對假定配偶中、經考慮結果、完全同意者、僅二對、其餘十六對、則均夫婦無緣、難期劍合、</p>

<h3 id="c150">金利源碼頭　十五號火棧失愼　起火原因未明損失二萬餘金　堆貨物十餘種均曾保有火險 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>昨晚六時許、法租界外灘招商局金利源碼頭第十五號貨棧、突吿失慎、燬去貨物甚多、綜計損失約共二萬餘元、詳情分誌於后、</p>
<p>濃烟外溢　法租界外灘招商局金利源碼頭、昨晚六時十五分、有該局第二十二號巡查員突然發現附近第十五號（老號頭十一號）貨棧、窗隙中有濃烟外溢、情知有異、立卽吹鳴警笛、同時奔局報告、轉報法租界救火會、</p>
<p>不可收拾　該局同時派出幹員多名、趕往佈置、詎甫逾五分鐘至六時二十分時、火勢已冒穿屋頂、不可收拾、同時各救火會救火車已陸續駛到、接水施救、奈因火勢悶抑、屋內灌射、頗威困難、故設法猛射、至十時許、火勢始吿稍殺、</p>
<p>棧中貨物　當時據該局職員聲稱、該號貨棧內今日（昨日）甫由新江天輪自溫州載來紹興酒約三百餘罎、蓆子·掃帚多件、此外尙有存貨如烟葉錫箔、以及生漆曁各種藥材等貨物、約十餘種之多、但所有貨物、均由各客家自行保險、僅有棧房、係由該局自行經由中國保險公司保險約萬元左右、</p>
<p>他未波及　按十五號棧房為前後兩進平房、起火係前一進、後進因中間有一甚寬闊之天井相隔、故幸未殃及、更因四壁砌造堅固、致附近鄰屋、均未波及、查該棧房原係怡和公司地產、由該局租地造屋、本年已屆期滿、現又續租二年、</p>
<p>原因未明　至起火原因、據該局職員稱、該局所有貨棧、向例每日至下午五時關閉、卽偶爾貨物搬運未完時、亦以至半為限、至於在棧員工在工作時、絕對禁止吸烟、以防火患、且各棧一經關閉後、棧內並無一人留守、僅有巡查員負責在棧外四週、嚴予巡查、</p>
<p>生漆被燬　今年歲首、該局第十四號棧亦遭回祿、損失與此次相等、尙有一事最足使人叫奇者、卽上次十四號貨棧被燬時、內有生漆數十伴、幸免於厄、當時卽遷入十五號棧內存儲、今十五號又遭燬去、該項生漆全數被焚無遺、由此可見一物之微、亦有一定刧運在也、</p>
<p>停業典當　四十餘家</p>
<p>本市典當同業、，分新同行與老行兩種、總計一百二十餘家、自民國二十年上海發生一二八戰事、迄今、瞬將四載、營業積年虧損、而典當業大部份係合夥組織、個人獨資開設者為數寥寥、合資開設之典當、股東方面、均不願繼續營業、故全市新老同行、自去年下半年至今春為止、宣吿停業者、已有四十餘家云、</p>
<p>租界典押　畸形發展</p>
<p>公共租界法租界兩區開設之典押當、不受我國政府之限制、自由營業、押期為六個月至八個月者居多、十二個月為數有限、當本雖較典當為大、但利息未滿五元之當本、表面定為每月二分、而實際則按月分三期、每期十天、取息二分、則全月利息、總計須六分、貧民在生計困難時、祗顧當本抬高、利息則在所不顧、是以典押當之營業日趨發達、現調查租界兩區內典押當總數六百五十餘家、處此百業凋敝聲中、不能不稱為畸形發展也、</p>

<h3 id="c186">昨晚中靑游泳池　水上遊藝盛極一時 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>四川路靑年會主辦之第一次水上游藝大會、昨晚七時半、在中靑游泳池舉行、節目豐富、興趣環生、大通社記者、於七時許入塲、已滿坑滿谷、座無隙地、可謂盛極一時、各情誌次、</p>
<p>公開項目</p>
<p>昨晚公開節目、共有六項之多、開始後、首由總裁判凌希陶報吿、旋即開始比賽、第一項目即為五十碼公開自由泳、參加者三人、全非中靑隊員、成績三十秒三、頗屬難能、第二公開項目、為百碼仰泳、因無人報到、改由中靑隊員表演、二百碼公開自由泳、祗一陳文和到塲、臨時拉中靑施博根陪泳、施為香港埠際選手、當非陳之敵手、此項須來回二十次、終點到達、陳尙落後二匝、施之成績為二分二十五秒、推為昨晚各項成績之最精彩者、兩項女子公開節目、祗陳劉周三小姐參加、其中尤以陳寳璇小姐、最為出色、</p>
<p>兩項接力</p>
<p>兩項接力賽之最引人興趣者、當以男女接力為最、此項距離六十碼、共須繞池三匝、梁陳余一組、當以陳小姐最為勞苦功高、當梁之二十碼到達時、三組幾不差分毫、結果賴陳小姐一臂奮先、余榮基則坐收其成、三式接力一項、第一組之一分十六秒成績、造成頗不容易、</p>
<p>花式游藝</p>
<p>第一項蘋菓泳、距離為四十碼、以蘋菓四枚、浮於二十碼處、泳至該處、須用口將蘋菓卸住、因水之波動、入口非易、結果梁偉生首先到達、惟經裁判發現、借助於手、遂取消其資格、開倒車及瞎子盜鈴兩項、興趣橫生、參觀人士、莫不哄堂、臘燭泳、祇余·陸兩人到達、餘均中途熄滅、三足泳係以兩人併縛一足、合泳結果、僅張梁一組到達、其餘簡周、則中途鬆散取銷、</p>
<p>拔河跳水</p>
<p>拔河共分已婚未婚兩隊、結果兩次均未婚隊勝、裁判陳富章、亦植立水中、可謂恪盡厥職、花式跳水、由梁偉生周瑞琴張榮光三人任裁判、結果鄭正仁以五十五分半獲首席、余榮基則以半分之差、屆居第二、惜哉、末二項之連珠砲、係以七人連串躍水、（後者執前者之足相繼躍下）尤博掌聲云、</p>
<p>水球比賽</p>
<p>滬上水球比賽、從不經見、祇前次香港隊來滬時舉行一次、此項原須計四人分兩隊舉行、昨日則以人數太少、故祇五人一隊、作為表演、分未婚已婚兩隊、比賽共十四分鐘、上半時未婚隊張榮光首開紀錄、（張為香港水球能手）、未幾已婚梁偉生報以一球、但不旋踵未婚周瑞琴又造成二對一、少頃未婚周達雲遠傳一球、正中鵠的、但銀笛長鳴、宣吿時間已計、一致取銷、濘檬後、已婚隊一無進展、未婚隊傳遞出神入化、周達雲再開紀錄、張榮光又連下兩城、結果未婚隊以五對一勝已婚、足見未婚隊之養精蓄銳、實力充足、非已婚所得望塵云、</p>

<h3 id="c207">貢獻給輟學就業的小朋友（談話） <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 淡雲</p>
<p>每年暑假，總有大批的小朋友從小學畢業了。這些小朋友中，有幸運的，也有不幸的，幸運的小朋友仍舊能繼續地升入中學，不幸的小朋友却只能輟學就職業了。</p>
<p>我希望這些輟學就業的小朋友不要灰心，因為世界上有許多的偉人都不是在正式的學校中畢業的，商務印書館總理王雲五先生就是一個最好的例，同時我更要對這些小朋友貢獻一些職業上的話。</p>
<p>職業無貴賤，無論任何職業中都潛藏着寶貝，執鋤去掘，就能掘着；但職業有好的也有壞的，所謂好的職業，就是適合於自己的職業；所謂壞的職業，就是不適合於自己的職業。</p>
<p>可見我們選擇職業，一定要顧到我們的能力和興趣，合於我們能力和興趣的職業，才能勝任，前途也有發展的希望；不過適合於我們能力和興趣的職業，做事時便覺乏味無聊，並且永遠沒有發展的希望。</p>
<p>不論任何職業，只要是適合於我們的能力和興趣的，都是好的—假如我們能夠努力的話。懶惰，不努力的人，什麼職業都是壞的，他永遠沒有在職業界長久立足的希望。</p>
<h3 id="c208">岳飛的幼年（故事） <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 穡秋</p>
<p>南宋高宗的時代，有個文武俱全，仁智兼備的民族英雄，這人就是我們大家知道的岳飛。</p>
<p>他的號叫鵬舉，是現在河南省湯陽陰縣人，家裏世代務農。他的父親，是一個很老實很祥慈的好好先生。據說岳飛生的時候，有一段神話，就是當他脫離母胎的當兒，忽然從東南角裏，飛來了一隻大鵬，不住的在屋上飛鳴着，因此起名叫飛，一般迷信朋友，便附會他是大鵬轉世，其實那裏有這種事情。</p>
<p>他生了下來，不滿一月，便逢到黃河水災，湯陰地方，頓時變成澤國。他母親姚氏，因水勢暴發，一時慌了手脚，便抱了岳飛，坐在一隻大甕中，任憑着它衝到什麼地方，幸而他命不該絕，在波浪中，浮來浮去，仍舊得到救星。</p>
<p>岳飛稍長，生得氣概非凡，同他一起玩的小朋友，都不及他。岳飛家裏，是很貧苦的，但他對於讀書，非常用功，尤其是左氏春秋和孫吳兵法，最合他的胃口。</p>
<p>他天生成很大的氣力，幾百斤重東西，可以輕輕提起來，不算一回事。他鄉本有個豪傑，名叫周侗，很常識岳飛，情願義務教授他射箭，又將自己所愛的兩張弓贈給他。岳飛獲到這樣知己的恩師，自然十分感激。但不幸得很，那同侗不久便死了，岳飛感恩知己，好不悲痛，於是每逢初一十五，必定預備了一杯酒，一盌肉，帶了周侗所贈的弓，跑到墳上去祭奠哭泣，一番而回。可是岳飛窮困異常，那裏來的錢買酒肉呢？因此他每逢祭奠一次，必定要賣去一件衣服，纔能上墳。</p>
<p>過了些時，他父親見他衣服一天天少起來，以為他變賣了用在不正當的地方，便叫來盤問，岳飛祇得老實說出。</p>
<p>他父親雖是個好好先生，但却很有見識，他叫了岳飛的一番話，不覺長歎一聲道：「現在國家多難，金兵得寸進尺，侵略不已，像你這樣小的年紀，已有這樣忠義，將來有機會為國效力的時候，一定可成為殉國死義的忠臣了」！岳飛答道：「父親能允許我以身許國，我還有何事不敢做的呢」？他父親不覺得贊歎道：「有這樣的兒子，我還愁什麼」！</p>
<p>後來岳飛果真大破金兵，恢復了不少失地，可惜給奸臣秦檜陷害，不能酬他的壯志，祇有他的英名，永永留在人間。</p>
<h3 id="c209">橡皮（常識） <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>『哥哥，我們用的橡皮，是不是從象身上的皮剝下來的』？敏兒一面做日記，一面手裏拿着一塊橡皮他對那塊橡皮看了一會，便放下鉛筆說。</p>
<p>『弟弟，不，橡皮是一種生在熱帶地方的橡樹，它能放出一種乳狀的膠汁，人們便利用了這樹膠去做橡皮』。聰兒是很歡喜的回答他。</p>
<p>『那麼我們穿的籃球鞋，是不是橡皮做的？怎麼這樣的硬』？</p>
<p>『橡皮有的硬得很，便有些人不當它是橡皮，像自來水筆的筆桿，這都是製造時放藥品多少的不同』。</p>
<p>『哥哥，你可能告訴我橡皮是怎樣製造的』？</p>
<p>『好，我來告訴你：先把橡樹刻一條深槽於是更慢慢地有樹膠流出來，讓它流到桶裏去，那裏的土人是拿了一根木棒，一面蘸樹橡，一面在爐子上烘，這樣的蘸烘，漸漸的成一張很厚的橡皮，但這不過是橡皮的原料罷了，不能用的，可是工廠裏不是這樣製造的，他們先把橡樹膠裏加醋，就成了粗質的橡皮，很軟而富有彈力性，但是這也不適用，因為久放在空氣裏要變脆的，便在這粗質的橡皮中再放百分之十的硫磺和一種金屬的化合物，然後放在不通空氣的器具中，燒到攝氏寒暑表十五度的時候，就變為很有彈力而耐用的橡皮了；這就是我們所用來手揩去字跡的橡皮。如果在粗質的橡皮中，放百分之十到百分之五十的硫磺，同時要燒到攝氏寒暑表一百八十度，那就變成一種極堅硬的橡皮，可以製造自來水筆的筆桿和留聲機上的唱片。』</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友！你看了這個題目，覺得奇怪嗎？鐵是多麼硬呀！想必這條蟲不知有多少大了，但是這蟲身體却是極小的，你且不必奇怪，聽我一一道來。</p>
<p>不知多少年前，南美洲的西方，火車往來航行，時常發生脫軌的事情，所以大家研究它的原因，結果發現軌道柔軟如棉，因此容易折斷，有人以為誰人惡作劇，撒了腐鐵藥在上面，但詳細考察之後，真相大白，決非撒了腐鐵藥所致的，調查結果，才知道是不過長六分，黑色如瑩的小蟲，伏在軌道中食鐵，使鐵柔軟而致折斷。</p>
<p>隨後就有人在鐵軌中，捕得一蟲，使共在舊鐵軌上試之，起初見他潛伏不動，後覺鐵的香味撲鼻，不能再忍耐，便徐徐而行，鐵路職員見他食鐵時，先後休內射出一種液汁，注在鐵上，然後缸體緊貼上，如蜜峰蝴蝶的吸取花心中的蜜一般，他所吸的鐵，立刻柔軟如棉。</p>
<p>試驗之後，知道這蟲每二星期，能食鐵軌三十六碼（合華尺九丈，所以蟲每頭，每日可食鐵軌，約有六尺五寸云）。</p>

<h3 id="c213">科學先生變戲法（游藝） <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>重物和輕物誰落得快？</p>
<p>今天，科學先生一登了台，就對台下的小朋友們說：</p>
<p>「諸位小朋友，大家想一想：這兒有一塊十斤重的石頭和一塊一斤重的石頭，如果同時由高處落下，那末誰先到地？」</p>
<p>有幾個小朋友想了一想，回答說道：「一定是那塊重十斤的石頭落得快，先到地。」</p>
<p>科學先生說：「你們錯了。從前的人也同你們一樣，以為重的東西，一定要經輕的東西落得快。後來意大利有一位科學家，叫做伽利略。他說：重的東西和輕的東西落下來的時候，是一樣快的。他因為要證明自己的這句話，所以有一天召集了許多人看他試驗。他從一種高塔上把一個十磅重的彈丸和一個一磅重的彈丸，同時向下一丟，果然，他的話一點也不錯，兩顆一重一輕的彈丸同時落到地上，同時發一聲響。」</p>
<p>有一個小朋友站起來責問道：「但是，我們有時候，把羽毛或紙片和銅元同時落下，為什麼銅元已經到地，而羽毛或紙片還在空中飄着呢？這難道不是重的東西比輕的東西落得快的證據麼？」</p>
<p>科學先生含笑道：「你能這樣用心，是很好的·我告訴你·這是紙片或羽毛受空氣的阻礙的緣故·銅元雖也受空氣的阻礙，但是落下的勢大些，不比紙片，羽毛那樣受着空氣很大的阻礙。如果把紙片，羽毛，銅元放在一個長玻璃管裏，抽去了空氣，使它們從上落下，就會看見它們是同時到底的。」</p>
<p>這時，他從褲袋裏取出一枚銅元和一張薄紙，把紙剪成比銅元稍小的圓形，疊在銅元上面（如第一圖—試驗時，必須把紙片緊裝在銅元上，以免漏入空氣）接着說道：</p>
<p>「現在這紙片因為疊在銅元上面，受不到空氣的阻礙，所以—」他一面說，一面把指間的銅元一放，只見紙片跟着銅元購落地了，「你們看清楚了麼？」</p>
<p>他又把紙剪成比銅元大些的圓形，疊在銅元上而（如第二圖）他的手指一放，銅元一閃眼落了地，那紙片却受着空氣的阻礙，在竄飄揚了一會，才落到地上。</p>
<p>「這種試驗是很容易的，我希望小朋友們大家回去試一試。」</p>
<p>（第一圖）比銅元小的紙片　銅元由此落下　　（第二圖）比銅元大的紙片</p>
<p>小工藝</p>
<h3 id="c214">老虎車 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 余銊</p>
<p>小朋友！你們背着的書包上學去的時候，在馬路上，看見過滿載着煤，鐵條，木料，或布匹的推車嗎？（又名老虎車）這種車的功用是很大的；許多商店裏的貨物，每天都靠它從棧房裏搬運到商店裏賣的。它不用電，也不用揮發油，它完全用四個車輪走路的。我們要用它的時候，只要推動那四個車輪，順勢的推着，就能前進了。這種車，分有大小兩種，大的只有兩個車輪，放在車的中間，這是因為重心的作用。這些車的原料，就是木材。現在你們都是小孩子拉不動鋸，舉不起鎚，怎麼能做大的推車呢？可是這裏有不用力不費錢的兩輛小推車，你們做做看！</p>
<p>拿兩隻大號火柴的空盒，套子剪車輪，和車炳。把丙殼剪成車箱，（如圖一）另外再用一根火柴，分成二段，（小號的要用　根火柴），把火柴頭的兩端削尖。先用針在車箱上和車輪的中心鑽一個洞，然後把削尖了的火柴插進去做軸，這樣，就做成了不費力氣不用本錢的兩輛小推車了！（如圖二）</p>
<h3 id="c215">笑的益處（衛生） <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 失</p>
<p>小朋友！笑是愉快的表現，想必你們都知道的。當我們心裏充滿歡喜的時候，就自然而然地發起笑來，同時心裏也就感覺到非常的愉快。但是，笑於我們的身體上，究竟有什麼益處？這是需要我們自己去研究了。</p>
<p>據生理學家說：「笑能夠增加心臟的博動：增加深呼吸。運動胸部筋肉，這幾宗事能夠使多量的氧氣經過血液，就能夠使血液很快的循環全身，這是增進健康的一種原因」。</p>
<p>所以現在一般衛生家，提倡身體懦弱的人，不必吃補藥，只要每天能夠大笑幾次，益處比吃補藥還要大些。因此近年以來，就有許多人專門研究滑稽劇，笑話，供給做發笑的資料，來代替補品。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友，兒童週刊裏也有許多補品給你們吃，你們曉得嗎？</p>
<p>請記者注意　中國兒童文化轉會，今日刻十二時至一時，假新新電台（週波七八〇）播音，請林蔭先生講「新牛郎織女故事，」及該會組織之兒童歌唱團播送歌唱，屆時請小朋友們注意收聽，又聞該會正在廣徵男女及兒童會員，願加入者可向河南路四五七號二樓該會函素　程。</p>

<p>— 心青</p>
<p>我既把所要做的事情做好了，就得子王的許可上船動身，儘我所能的早早回去。</p>
<p>我們一路還沒去遠，便有披甲的兇漢們向我們駛來奪了我們的船；他們打我們不肯投降他們的水手都處死了。於是把我們餘下的人帶了去，因為他打算使我們像奴隸一舞的工作。</p>
<p>他們從我們身上把好衣服取去了，給我們破爛的衣服作代，不多時我們來到一個小島上，他們便將我們像奴隸般賣掉了。</p>
<p>我被一個富人買去，他一付了錢，帶我到他屋中去給我吃，給我喝，給我穿好的衣服。幾天過去了，於是有一天我的主人對我說「你可知道些買賣上的事麼」。</p>
<p>我道：「我原是買賣貨物的，但那將我賣給你的人，早把我所有的貨物都去了」。</p>
<p>他道：「和我說，你可能取一隻弓射擊麼」？</p>
<p>我對他說：少年時原是善射的，心想我仍還是好好的射咧。他聽我這舞說，便給了我一隻弓和幾枝箭。我倆同騎了象出發，到離鎮幾里外的一個大森林中去。</p>
<p>我們到了林中，他叫我爬上一株高樹，就從樹枝間向那些經過我近邊的象身上射去，因為這森林中是很這極大的獸的。他吩咐我倘已射發了一頭，便報告他；於是給了我些吃的東西，留下我在那裏，而他自己却回鎮去了。</p>
<p>我終誑很着意的守望着，但是並沒瞧見甚麼。接着天明來了，我從樹中間瞧上了一大翠。</p>
<p>他們走近了我，我便瞄凖了向他射去，一時間我没幸運，但是末後却射中了一頭跌倒了。那一弩申其餘的都逃去了，到得他們一出了我的視綫，我便從樹上下來，動身到鎮中去告知我的主人，我已射殺了一頭獸了。</p>
<p>他聽了我的消息很快樂；他給我一頓美餐，於是我們取道加林中去。在那邊我們掘了一個很深的洞，就中放着那隻死象。這樣做了，那死獸的肉便腐爛，於是那長牙啊，別的齒啊和存留下來的各部份都可賣好多金錢的。</p>

<h3 id="c230">中庸與平等 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>如果說中國人有着中國人固有底哲學，那末這不是別的，是所謂中庸之這。</p>
<p>流氓敲竹槓，常常是兩個人幹的；一個人做紅臉，一個人做白臉。這樣，旣不過火，也不示弱，進可以攻，退可以守，紅臉，可以駭嚇人，白臉，萬一吃　時也可以下塲，剛柔相濟，是謂中庸，中庸是無往而不利的。</p>
<p>中國孩子八字中缺少了火，爺娘就替他題上了「炎」「燊」等等名字，這也不外乎求其中庸。還有人說中國人抽水烟袋是最合衛生的，因為水火相濟，無傷於肺！中國人吃大米，也勝過洋鬼子吃麺包，因為稻子是上半截曬着太陽，下半截浸在水裏的；這些都合乎中庸之道。</p>
<p>於是有人說男外女內，是中庸。這是各盡其所能，是合理的分工，公平·而又平等，根據聖人孔子和中國古代無名氏大思想家—易經作者底理論都能證明·</p>
<p>平等，平等，嚷了好幾年，原來都是白嚷的，婦女們在四五千年以前就獲得了平等了！</p>
<p>於是，平等中庸化，於是婦女們熱烈追求的「平等」，成為可咒咀的名字了！</p>
<p>假使這樣的所謂中庸是公平，合理而平等的，那麽，奴隸社會該是最伶理的社會，奴隸制度，卽是最理想化，最値得謳歌的制度·</p>
<p>何以故？這是合理的分工·這是各盡所能。</p>
<p>主子底白手本來宜於執鞭子，奴隸天生賤骨，本來合宜於換勞，一方指揮，一方勞作，得乎中庸！</p>
<p>現在一般婦女，是家庭的奴隸。她們做着無報酬的苦役，她們被困縛於新舊禮敎中，沒有政治的覺醒，要得到最低限度的文化水準也不可能，生活是虛偽，辛酸，勞苦而可羞。沒有暖氣，沒有別程，沒有意職，日子一天天通去，只是艱苦的連續。然而，呵！這在壓迫者看來，這是公平而平等，這是合理的分工喲！</p>
<p>假裝看合理，公平，平等而出現的中庸，是壓迫者底瞞天大謊，是維護現狀的說敎；這樣說的人，是企圖把對婦女大衆的陵壓合理化，沒有別的。</p>

<h3 id="c231">第二節　家庭的解體與婦女 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>十八世紀以來的產業革命是對於整個社會機構，引起了空前未有的大變革，這變革在從來的家族生活上給與了特別深刻的破壞的影響。就是說，「大工業破壞了從前的家族組織及其所相應的家庭勞動的經濟基礎，同時破壞了從來的家族關係，」這樣，資本主義便把從來的家庭改造過來，作成了適應於自己體的新的生活制組織。</p>
<p>資本主義的家庭改造，是一方面奪去從來家庭內的傳統的職務，他方面把家庭的勢力圈縮小起來，結果，家庭在社會上的任務幾乎完全消失，牠祇殘留着空虛的軀殼而已。這不是改造，而是『解體』。</p>
<p>我們知道，在封建時代，家庭為社會的經濟的生產單位？為國家基礎的細胞組織，更為文化的敎育的集合體。因此，家庭的紐帶非常緊密，可是，產業革命以後，隨着資本主義的經濟組織的發達，家庭內的生產的任務日益縮小，而家族員必然加入於社會的生產關係，這樣家庭祇除了性生活及消費目的外，並無何等存在的意　。</p>
<p>但是在這家庭的崩解過程中，兩種不同的婦女羣，向着兩種不同的前途從家庭解放出來。即一是有　的家庭婦女，一是勞動婦女。</p>
<p>在商業資本主義時代，有錢人的家庭中尙有多少男女間的分業，主婦除了消費者的職能外，還能執行種種家政上的任務，可是到了十九世紀後半，隨着社會組織及技術的發達，家庭內主婦的任務，非常减少，自縫紉，編織以至製作餅食等從來主婦所担任的工作，完全移讓於企業家之手。甚至敎養子女的任務亦移讓於專門家或社會機關。她的任務，祇是生孩子及消費丈夫賺來的金錢而已。這樣，有閑婦女是從家庭瑣事中解放出來。整日在艷裝，看戲，談天，宴舞等墮落生活中消磨時日。法國的民權擁護論者朱爾海德，是這樣描寫近代有閑人的家庭：</p>
<p>「在「口裏含着銀匙生下來的」人們中，普通在家族間可做的事情，用金錢雇家族外的人來使他去做。家族外的雇女——奶媽哺育子女，另雇保姆給孩子們穿衣，洗面，吃飯，甚至扶着行走。還有家族外的家庭敎師，負担孩子們的教育。……這樣有錢人的家庭，現在祇殘留着生命的形骸，至多不過是一座金庫而已。」</p>
<p>這樣，有錢人家的婦女是從細瑣的家務中解放出來，過着頽廢的生活，可是勞勤婦女是完全相反，其實她們並不是從家庭解放，而是環境强迫她離開家庭。因為丈夫的收入不够養活妻和子女的時候，她們為着生存不得不出賣廉價的勞動力。</p>
<p>離開家庭到工塲去的婦女，不得不把孩子們放任於街頭的敎育或鄰人的監視。一天到晚在工塲中過疲勞的生活，她們完全失去了所謂「家庭的樂團」。在她們看來，家庭祇不過是夫婦的共同休息所，可是，過於疲勞的妻和因生活壓迫而神經過敏的丈夫間，慢說沒有什麽相互的慰藉，一碰頭就很容易動氣漫駡，他們的家庭，連所謂『休息所』的意義都沒有。</p>
<p>這個樣子，婦女勞動是破壞資本主義社會的家庭制度。但家庭的沒落，雖如何慘酷也好，婦女的職業化本身是非常進步的歷史的現象。為什麽？因為祗有破壞這家庭的婦女勞動，才能够創造出家族及結婚關係的新的形態的原故。我們再看以下的一段敎示吧。</p>
<p>『在資本主義制度之下的舊家族關係的崩壞，雖如何可怕，而且可厭惡的表現出來也好，大工業是在社會的被組織的生產過程中，即在家庭外，對於婦女，男女未成年者及幼年者給予了積極的任務，由此創造出新的經濟的基礎，同時創造家族及兩性關係的最高形態』。</p>
<h3 id="c232">謠言中之犧牲者 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 鐵</p>
<p>在復古聲浪日益高漲，南北都市相互輝映着男女有別的德政——北平提倡男女分校，廣州限制女茶室女工——的當兒，長江流域的杭州市某小學，也掀起了一段男女問題的小風波。風波雖然小，影響於婦女地位却甚大，特就所聞，報吿於婦女園地。</p>
<p>女子終於是男性中心社會的女子，在二十餘位園丁——敎員耕耘著的某小學園地，女園丁只占到六個地位，雖然她們也一樣的努力耕耘，但是，在這一學期的終了，却來了意外的打擊。除出了二位有夫之婦外，據說其他四位密司，每位都愛上了一個男同事；而且其中一位，還愛的是全校之主。男女間之不能沒有愛。男女同事相愛之不能成為被辭退的罪狀，只要是現時代的人，只要是頭腦稍稍淸楚一點的人，誰也不會否認。而結果，三位密司被辭退了，謠言中的他們的愛人，却依然不動；其他一對，也雙雙同在，而且只有這一對，倒不是謠言而是事實。據說該校之所以這樣做，完全是太上校長的意思。</p>
<p>事實的經過及處理是如此，這是男性中心社會的女子地位的寫照。不然，要洗淸謠言，為什麽定要拿女子來犧牲呢？</p>

<p>— 珍妮</p>
<p>為了生活，為了做個獨立的人，離開了這煩囂，但又狠富有刺激性的上海，到了川省的××鎭做個苦敎員，一年的辛苦，歸來後的旅　裏只　着十只光洋。知識慾大張的我，最喜歡讀書，尤其關於女人的書報，由於「婦女園地」的介紹，知道有一個「婦女生活」月刋，快將出版，一日下午到上海，晚上急急跑到四馬路雜誌公司，去尋它——婦女生活。知道預定比零買便宜，很痛快地在那十只光羊中，斬了兩只。他們還我小羊四匹，帶了「婦女生活」，興然回家。</p>
<p>「在這內憂外患的重重壓迫下，『我們怎樣做人呢』我也這嫌疑問着，希望解答。「婦女生活」據說是解答這個疑問的。她們發刋詞裏說：「她將做你的知友，給你許多智慧，使你認識自己，認識別人，認識世界，認識一切的醜惡。她將做你的先導，給你許多指南，使你知道怎樣脫去重壓怎樣做人，怎樣做社會人！怎樣携手走上光明大道」。我相信，從此我有了知友，有了先導。快樂之餘，很快地讀下去。短評三則是評論最近發生的婦女時事，筆者用輕描淡寫的筆調，正確地交代了每問題。短評後就是專論，第一篇是金仲華先生的「給現階段的中國婦女」，在這講話難的時節，金先生很巧妙地說出了目前婦女運動的任務，熱心婦運的人們，務需一讀。其次是章錫琛先生的「婦女的分工」，「婦女回到家庭裏去」，是很時髦的口號，章先生用分工的學說，來攻擊這時髦的理論，他說：「分工是社會進化的最大原則，在男子如此，在女子也是如此。違反這原則的一切努力，在社會進化史上看起來，總歸是徒然的。」這給予主張「婦女回家」論者以絕好的答復。接着就是曹聚仁先生的「男女同學，」讀了覺得幽默而沉痛，大有使我啼哭皆非之慨。易卜生的「娜拉，」在五四時代，已經到了中國，然而隨着「婦女回家」的聲浪，曾出走的「中國娜拉」，大都乖乖地在回家了，所以易卜生的「娜拉」，重新再被介紹，仍屬必要；碧遙先生的「娜拉三態」，不但盡了這個任務，且更指出了大家現在理想中的「中國娜拉」，决不是易卜生時代的娜拉「她不但會反抗丈夫對妻子的不平等，而將反抗世間一切不平等的現象。她不但要謀個人的解放，而將要謀社會人類的解放。」碧遙先生的文章，我讀到過不少，覺得這篇最為出色。「婦女回家庭去嗎？」一文的上面，放着一個在手舞足蹈的孩子，拖着個穿高跟皮鞋的婦女的「頭花」，由這塊頭花，引起了我特別的興趣，一口氣讀完了正文，回頭再來著作者，才知道是五四時代的婦運健將王孝英先生的大作，許多五四時代的女英雄，現在都躱進了高樓大厦，王先生却參在現在的新的隊伍裏反對復古，不禁使我肅然起敬。文章人人會做，巧妙各有不同，關於已婚婦女姓夫姓的問題，早先報上已有人討論過，慕暉先生借賽珍珠的改嫁來討論這婦姓夫姓問題，總算會借題發揮了，尤其文字的幽默輕鬆，會使一般載着夫姓帽子的太太們，有些「何以為情吧？」。君慧，我的講師，我在婦女園地上每週聽你的演講，從沒一次間斷過，可是我們倆始終無緣見面！眞是憾事。你的「現代的結婚與離婚」正和婦園中的講話以及女聲中的論文同樣，有根有據地解釋了現代婚姻的醜惡，也是一幅現社會屍體的解剖圖。</p>
<p>旅倦與知識愁，嚴整着陣容，在我的心身上開戰，終於旅倦的魔鬼戰勝了，它俘獲了我的眼睛，似乎再不能往下讀了。合了書，被那綠色可愛的封面的誘惑，不忍釋手，因此很自然地重看了一次目錄。這裏我突然發現了奇蹟，漫談西湖女香客，下面署名是韵漪，韵漪？我小學時代的老師，不是呌「×韵漪嗎」？我又重翻開書本。護該文。證明它定是老師的手筆。老師，你也記得你頑皮的珍妮？你的文章，眞不錯，不但把奇形怪狀的西湖香客，細緻地描出，且對整個的婦女迷信，下了解答。給了我不少認識。</p>
<p>第二天絕早起來就讀婦女生活。恨不得立刻全部呑到了肚裏。</p>
<p>開始讀社會科學講話。第一講社會科學之哲學的基礎講師是沈志遠先生。文筆的流麗，措詞的淺顯，使我讀小說一樣地讀了下去。絕對沒有一般哲學書籍那樣難讀難懂。孫育才先生的「婦女與戰爭，」把整個的帝國主義的容陣，簡單明瞭地來了一個報吿，說明世界大戰的必然來臨，在這山雨欲來風滿樓的前夕，婦女參加這殘酷的戰爭嗎？祈禱和平嗎？都不是的。他有更進一層的解釋；話長，讀者各自去一讀該文。總之要了解時事，要明白婦女此後的任務，非一讀該文不可。任遠先生的「現代土耳其的婦女生活，」說明各種土耳其婦女的解放事實，同時他仍說雖則如此，她仍未完全解放，怎樣才完全解放，又要請讀者在該文尋取了。氣熖萬丈的我們的隣邦，他們的農付婦女生活怎樣？你去讀雪影先生的文章吧。茅盾先生的「第一個半天的工夫，」將一初上職業　　的女子的內心，　　得淋漓磁臘。白　的我寫它的動樣，是她的長篇小說「悲劇生涯」的序文。接着是新鮮的「電影小說「船家女」，有文有圖，很有意思。希望以後按期有這樣一篇。「生存綫」上有小學敎師，有大學學生，有棄婦，有明星，有鄕村的勞働婦女，她們問這生存綫上掙扎。可當作小說讀，可當作社會相看。其餘生理衛生講話，科學雜談，都是淺顯而富趣味。總之它給了我相當滿足。同時我也很不客氣地下一點批評。一，印刷蹩脚，二文字不甚通俗化。三，取材大嚴肅。這是我讀後感到不滿的地方，希望從速改良，如編者所說地，「使它成一大衆愛好的讀物」。</p>

<p>— 林沅</p>
<p>在舊禮敎的嚴威之下，女子祇有屈服，祇有啞忍，那所謂「終身大事」的婚姻也沒有方法抵抗的！在這無路可走的時候，我想讀書謀自立，才和母親及祖母商量，到城裏去讀書，她們倆都特別疼愛我的，當然答應我的要求，那時候幸喜我父親不在家，如果在家就沒有希望了，他是「女子無才便是德」主義的！</p>
<p>在城裏讀了一年書寒假回家時，嫂嫂便悄悄的吿訴我說，「姑姑你明年不能再讀書了，聽說男家明年秋天决定娶你回去了！」這是睛天霹靂，禁不住全身顫抖起來，那時候我的父親已經回來了，我便鼓起勇氣，託一位堂姊姊間接和母親說，「我明年無論如何不結婚，我要多讀幾年書，如果你們不從，我只好自殺，」我母親也很担心，便吿訴我的父親，父親怎樣呢？從來在男性中心社會養尊處優慣的父親是絕對不會理解此中痛苦的，他祇有覺得女子的不甘屈服是不合理：所以，他聽了母親的話之後，便駡我的母親，「讀書，讀得人都變壞了，不應該答應他去讀書！誰聽過女子敢反對婚姻，明年不許再讀！」從此以後，我便連讀書的一綫希望也斷絕了！</p>
<p>在這殺人不見血的社會裏，被殘忍的專制呑沒了我的婚姻的自由，我的行動都受到嚴酷的管束，到了第二年便馴羊般的和那陌生的人結婚了！</p>
<p>離開了相依十餘年的家庭，以及親愛的父母姊妹，忽然換了一個陌生的環境，任何人也會感到生疏痛苦，何况加上種種禮敎的壓迫，日常的生活，眞是和啞子吃黃連一樣。</p>
<p>我是給祖母嬌養慣了的，不會挑担，不會種田，所以怕翁姑的不滿意，又怕姑姊娌妯的不和睦，還要担心村鄰的批評。這許多中沒有一件不使我提心吊胆，步步謹愼。</p>
<p>在這拘謹的生活裏，不但沒有意氣相投的人談話，就是丈夫也不能。在我們的封建的鄕村裏，婦女白天是不能和丈夫說話的，就是見面也要趕快躲避，不然的話，那就要招人駡你『妖覽作怪的女人，」翁姑也就會不高興你了。</p>
<p>至若村裏的鄰人看見新人呢，不是椰揄，便是批評，總之處成使你不痛快。在這種環境裏，每天除了燒飯，洗衣，吸猪，喂鷄以外，只有孤單單地坐在房間裏替小姑，小叔們做針綫。這樣的日子大槪過了有半年多。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c235">比國貶低幣値與金本位集團 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 紀齊</p>
<p>金本位制度，可是說是資本主義的一個特點。英美法德等先進的資本主義諸國家，原來都是行着金本位制度的。但是自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌爆發以來，物價日益低下，生產也隨之减退，各資本主義國家的對外貿易因此也就表現出了日益衰落的現象。在這情况下，有些資本主義國家為了要提高物價，刺激生產，减低對外滙價，增進輸出，便不得不自行撕去其繁榮的面具，放棄金本位制度了。於是，英美等國首先實行貶低幣値，放棄金本位制度，開始了猛烈的貨幣戰爭。這個貨幣戰爭，不僅與放放棄了金本的國家的經濟政治哦極密的切的關係，而且對那些尙維持着金本的國家也有極大的影響。很顯然的，日貨的脚跡之能印遍世界各地，英美經濟之相對的好轉，其主要原因之一，都是在於它們的貶低幣値，放棄金本位，使其對外滙價低落。但維持金本位的國家在國際貿易中便受到了許多妨害，事實上法郞在英鎊與美元繼續低價的交攻中早已呈現出了幾乎不能維持的狀態。因此，以法國為盟主的歐洲的維持金本位制國家，如比利時，意大利，瑞士，荷蘭與盧森堡等為了要援救本國經濟，便於一九三三年七月倫敦世界經濟會議中結合起來，一致主張維持金本位，成立了金本位集團。接着它們又在同年九月舉行會議，决定組織委員會來負專責。到了一九三四年十月十九日波蘭也參加了進去，重在比京布爾塞拉舉行會議，討論一切。於此我們可以說，所謂金本位集團，便是法，比，意，瑞士，荷蘭，波蘭，盧森堡等七國所結成的對認棄了金本位的英美等國的共同戰綫。</p>
<p>但是，所謂金本位集團的結合却並不如何堅實。其中如意大利雖在表面上還維持着金本位，但在其實際的統制經濟之下，可以說是已經停止了金本位的；於比利時，更可說是金德兩大國之間，向來是依靠着法國的援助來維持其命運的。在上次大戰中，因為遭到了德國的蹂躪，一時之間其國內經濟幾乎陷入了絕望的境地。後來因為在凡爾賽和約中得到了許多利益，由於法人的援助和其自身的努力，才能漸次恢復起來，維持其金本位制度。但在世界經濟恐慌的狂流中，比利時的經濟危機也日益深化起來；金本集團產生後，雖然得到了與金本位國家的互相提携的利益，但因為英美日等國繼續地减低幣値，努力向世界各處傾銷其商品，金本位國家在滙兌往來中，在國際貿易中是日益陷入了不利的境地，於是勉强維持金本位的比利時便明白地表現出了經濟的財政的乃至政治的絕大危機。</p>
<p>金本位集團是在法國努力支持之下繼續存在的；比利時的金本位當然更不能離開法國的援助而獨立維持。但是，在世界經濟恐慌繼續發展之下，在美圓金鎊和日金繼續貶價之下，在德國積極向外發表的各種表現之下，法蘭西自身的經濟財政和政治都在日益惡化中，法郞的命運可謂危險已達萬分。近年來法國政局的不安，閣潮的繼續不已，便是這種情形的具體表現。因此，當比國財政發生絕大危機，比幣非常混亂時，前首相瑞尼斯雖親往巴黎呼救，懇求法國給與四十億法郞的援助，以解救其財政困難，維持其平價，可是結果除了「比幣業已獲救，比國仍將守金本位」的空頭宣言外，並沒有得到什麽實際的援助，以致使瑞尼斯返國後，即發表了滙兌管理的緊急令，跟着就辭職了。於是銀行界的首要紀蘭氏，為了要實行强力政策，便受到所謂舉國一致的擁護而登台了。</p>
<p>紀蘭內閣成立後，即在上下兩院中通過了通貨獨裁案，其主要內容乃是停止金兌換，減低貝爾加（比幣）的金平價百分之二十八，依靠新經濟復興案來解救其經濟危機。紀蘭說：「前內閣懇求法國援助終於失敗了，財政危局已惡化了，現在唯一的救濟方策，只有使貝爾加與金分離，而且貶値，貝爾加一時不保持與金平價的嚴格聯　。……羅斯福的復興政策是值得稱讚的，但那以縮短勞動時間為根基的勞動政策及其通貨政策，却當反對。美國沒有降低平價的必要。如果美國有確定的經濟政策，那是可以克服世界的不景氣的。現在我們已在第一綫上失策了，所以要救濟貝爾加，只有退守第二綫才能實現。……」自是比利時便斷然實行了放棄金本位和降低平價的政。</p>
<p>比利時是金本位集團中的一個主要的腳色，它實行貶低幣值，放棄金本位的結果，必然會使其與金本位集團諸國的關係發生大的變化，甚至走到與這些國家對立的境地。就目前情勢看來，貝爾加有接近英鎊的可能，使歐洲的經濟界更加複雜化，甚至使金本位集團解體。</p>
<p>法國是金本位集團的盟主，比利時的貶低幣値使整個金本位集團的陣綫大為動搖，這對於法國不消說是給與了重大打擊的。近月來，法國財政的困難，法郞的危機，可謂已達極點；賴伐爾內閣雖在國會中通過了財政全權案，實行以狄克推多的手段來制止投機，維持法郞，但據各專家的推論，其前途仍是未可樂觀。最近又盛傳比國貨幣行將再度貶値，這傳說雖為比當局所否認，但就比利時本年度預算虧負數額在四萬萬貝爾加以上一事看來，比幣冉度貶值的實現並非全不可能。假使比幣眞的再度貶値了，那與比國關係最深的法國在經濟上必將受到更大的打擊。此外，如荷蘭，瑞士等金本位國家亦必然要受到極大的影響，這樣，金本位集團的崩淡，可以說是無法避免的事情，所差的只是時間問題而已。</p>

<h3 id="c236">閒話濟南 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 胡滿</p>
<p>濟南，一個古老的城巿。牠　原是一個「府」，又是「歷城」縣—家住山東歷城縣的「秦二哥」，就是這兒的產物。</p>
<p>牠是山東的省會，除了靑島，在山東要算牠最繁榮了。同時就拿整個華北來說，雖不能與北平，天津媲美，但總可以緊接在牠們的後面的。因為這兒有新式的交通工具，作為牠的脈膊：膠濟鐵路由靑島到這裏，約有十二小時的途程：同時津浦路縱貫其問，正是南北的中心。所以濟南雖是一個古老的城市，牠却浸潤着資本主義的漿汁：這兒有新式的建築（高大的洋樓，寬敞的柏油路）商店中大都是機器生產的貨物。總之，牠已改變了本來的面目，一步一步的走向新的道路。</p>
<p>不過這兒的風俗，習慣，却仍是很舊式；所謂「舊禮敎」的氛圍，比之南方任何都市都要濃厚。譬如男女挽着手兒在街上行走，可以說是很尋常的事；不但在南方的各大城市中都是數見不鮮的，就是在北平，天津，靑島，也並不使人驚異。可是在濟南就要成問題了；不但警察要加以干涉，就是旁人也要誹笑。所以在濟南這麽大的城市中，很少發現挽手行走的靑年男女，而且男女一道的都很少見。</p>
<p>濟南的風俗，習慣，像這樣的古舊，一則由於山東××的保存古風，同時仲近「聖人」的家鄉，受了「聖人」的「威化」，也是重大的原因。人們大槪還沒</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>有忘記：今年三四月間，傳遍全國的「萬里尋夫」的「故事」就發生在這兒，假如不是由於山東××的提倡，當地人士給牠捧塲，我想韓桂卿，孫德福之名，也不會被我牢牢記着吧！（可惜韓桂卿終究不是「孟姜女」？孫德福也不是「萬杞梁」，這未免是一件憾事）</p>
<p>不久以前，「桃色家庭慘變」發生後，竟轟動了整個濟南城，而且社會情况為之一變。無論茶樓，酒社，街頭，巷尾，都拿此事當作談話的題材，當地的報紙每日都以頭號標題記載慘變的經過和慘劇中主角們的行動。一般公務人員大都人人自危，深怕自己的老婆也被人奪取，於是有人請求政府給自己的家庭予以保障，有人請求嚴緝「奪妻賊」王崇范，捉拿「背夫棄子」「私奔」的王志先，同時大都與周炎光表示同情，予以慰問。至於社會一般的輿論，更是痛駡「奸夫」「淫婦」了！像這樣的事體，在上海，在廣州，在香港，也許每天都可發現，然而並不如此轟動，由此可知濟南的風俗，習慣，尙在封建意識籠罩下了。</p>
<p>然而守舊的風俗，習慣，並不减低我對於濟南的愛好。因為這兒的淫汚氣氛比較稀薄，物質的壓力也比較輕微。像我們這樣在大城市中受苦的人們，實在感覺不了牠的好處，祗覺得牠是吃人的猛獸，磨折人們的魔鬼。但是，跑到濟南來了以後，却覺得身上减輕了許多壓力，同時呼吸上都好像輕鬆許多。這自然並不是說可以吸收自由的空氣，而是由於生活低廉：在上海每月最少要十元的伙食，此地只要四元就得了。譬如豬肉在上海要四角錢一斤，此地只要二毛。總之生活上的需要，都比較便宜。住在這兒，最少可以减輕一半負祖。</p>
<p>除了生活便宜之外，在濟南還有很多可供遊玩的勝地。看了「老殘遊記」的人們，一定知道濟南有個「大明湖」，現在離湖不遠，還存在着蒼老的「鐵公祠」，也許就是後人給老殘留下的紀念（老殘名鐵英，據遊記上說他給山東人民做了許多「人道」事業）。湖面寬闊，湖水淸幽，如遇微風，淸澈的湖水便掀起漣漪，令人見着十分可愛。濟南城中的士女，大都把這兒當作遊玩的樂園，（或她們）或在湖邊垂釣，或蕩舟於，一壁搖漿，一壁談笑，人世間一愁，都讓湖水洗滌無餘了！每逢端，湖中有龍舟競賽，同時小艇也史為活躍，好像幾十隻蜻蜓在水面飛來飛去一樣。在濟南，可與大明湖媲美的要算千佛山了，這兒不單有「古佛」「尊神」的像，可供觀賞，而且地勢高敞，淸幽，俯視大明湖如像一面明鏡。除了這兩處名勝，還有四大名泉——珍珠泉？趵突泉，金絲泉，黑虎泉，都是好玩的地方。如在暑天，還是納凉的佳所。</p>
<p>說到濟南的文化，在山東自然要算比較發達。學校方面，男的有個師範學校（前後期），一個高中，和一個初中。另外還有女師，女中。其他的文化機關，有實騐劇院（注重新劇，舊劇亦常排演，院長王泊生），民衆敎育館（所注重的是演戲，鄉村敎育）。如果不是因為方針錯誤，可說成績是很好的。</p>
<p>這兒還有幾種小型刋物，出刋的期間沒有一定，因為主辦者大都是靑年學生，有時為了經濟困難便暫時停刋。執筆者大都是初學寫作的靑年學生，因此內容也很貧乏。據我所知道的有「靑年文化」，所談的是半生不熟的社會科學。其餘如「華蒂」（What），「一綫」，都是純文藝刋物。還有「山東民國日報」的副刋，也是一個文藝園地，在這園地裏栽培花木的，大都是女師，女中的學生——女孩兒們竟有這般勇氣，在濟南的文壇上奪取地盤，同時又有這般情趣，培植文藝花木，却也値得歡喜，慶幸！</p>
<p>最後我要提到商務方面。這兒的代表商業區域，要算「商埠」和「國貨商塲」了。商埠所賣的貨物，大都是機器生產的舶來品，這些東西盤據了濟南整個市塲，吸收了人民的購買力。至於國貨商塲，反相形見拙，幾乎被舶來品擠掉了存在的地位。同時所謂「國貨商塲」，說來却也可憐，除了本省的草帽，博縣的瓷器，可以拉着一部分買主外，其餘便沒有人問津，而且也無貨可賣了！</p>
<h3 id="c237">農村的公民訓練 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 伯</p>
<p>嘉定通訊</p>
<p>為了活命，我在幾年前就已溷跡在都市裏了。有些人老以為到都市裏生活的人，必是為享樂去的，其實單只想想我自己，這幾年來所遭受到的艱難，壓迫和侮辱，已不能用車載或斗量了。</p>
<p>不過，鄕村中的一切，平整的瓦屋，忠誠儉樸的鄉人，以及一切雍容閑逸的氣息，我都非常熟識的，雖然生活的牆把我隔離了這一切。近來在都市裏老聽婦　　　潰，農民購買力衰跑瞭　消息，於是我每天晚上都帶着不寗靜的神經去推想自己家鄉的瓦屋是否還是像以前一樣平整的，鄕人是否仍是像以前一樣和氣安逸的。</p>
<p>後來終於得了個機緣，可以回去探望故鄉一切的人物了。</p>
<p>回家後第一件感到不平常的事，是有許多活潑精壯的靑年人向來在都市中生活的，現在都歇業回家了。</p>
<p>我們這個地方，全鎭近乎千把人家，雖然多數靠墾泥塊活命，但因為田地的缺乏，凡一家有二個兒子的，一個兒子一定要弄到外面去學手藝或做學徒。雖然學手藝做學徒並不見得有出息，只不過使都市裏多了幾個被踢被打的小丑角，但看看墾不出黃金的田畝，也只得向都市裏去寄生了。</p>
<p>以前聽人說，農村破產使都市多一份危機，現在都市也破產了，許多商店倒閉，工廠關門，雖有勞力也無處出售，於是這一羣從農村到都市裏來的寄生虫，重新又回到農村來。農村是正在無法苟延生命，再加上這般洶湧地從都市中回來的靑年人的啃嚙，農村惟有更加速的崩潰了！</p>
<p>碰到幾個從前小學時代的同學，——這般小商人，他們都哭喪着臉，訴說着自己困苦的狀况，他們已經養成了斯文樣子，而又不能得過斯文的生活，甚且老麥飯（鄉人因貧窮之故，米飯中雜以粗粒的麥屑）也將無力進口，他們眞是陷於生死的界綫上。</p>
<p>這農村如已經破爛了的船，再加上這般游民的重量，它恐怕遲早要沉沒的罷。</p>
<p>第二件事値得提起的，是故鄉推行保甲聲中的花絮。年來故鄉奉上峯命令，厲行保甲制，先自調查戶口入手，再編訂保甲，十戶一甲，設甲長，十甲一保，設保長，聯合各保設鄉長或鎭長。幾經繁瑣的手續，總算大體完成了。可是咱們老百姓，一向沒有經過團體的訓練，一旦要他們担任什麽甲長保長，自然要閙得笑話百出，使人聽了噴飯的。有一次，縣長親自下鄉抽查考騐。至某甲長處，問道：「你知道甲長做些什麼事？」該甲長見官長下臨蓬摹，誠惶誠恐的，幾乎瞠目結舌，不知所對，繼而謂：「做紙作騙飯吃。」縣長等相與大笑。蓋這位甲長確是靠糊糊紙作活命的。又至另一甲長處，問：「你這一甲包括那幾家？」答：「對門張三郞，隔壁黃書觀，再過去是豆腐店，李家酒店，……」原來豆腐店以北已不是屬於這甲了。又至又一甲長處，問：「你自家是第幾保第幾甲？」該甲長兩眼直睜，忙道：「讓我去看門牌來！」</p>
<p>奉廳令，各縣均須辦保長訓練所，各保長均須入所受訓，若不到，須受相當處罰。縣長於是親到各鄉勸導。保長中智識程度相差極遠，最高的有大學敎授國學專家，最低者一有目不識丁，不知天南地北的。因為窮鄉僻壤中，大多以有財產者卽奉為鄕紳，因鄕紳卽推為保長之故。縣長說：「這次保長訓練，無論如何都要出席。有的人以為我是智識階級的人，不要受訓，其實這是不應該的。本邑×區×保長是大學敎授，學問智識，就是本縣長也及不上，可是他老人家也親來受訓。要知公事應該公辦，好在只有十幾天工夫，日子並不長。至於住處飲食衛生本縣長一定特別注意。」</p>
<p>這樣雷厲風行，十年之後，民智提高了，人民組織力養成了，國家前途或者有些希望吧！然而這十年之內，是否能讓你好整以暇的靜靜的踱步呢？思之不禁愴然。</p>

<h3 id="c238">國語羅馬字批判 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 剛</p>
<p>中國現在需要一種科學的，為了大衆的，國際化的拚音文字，這當是朝野上下共同的感覺。民國十七年大學院曾為應這種要求而正式公佈國語羅馬字拚音法式，但七年以來看不見什麼成績，讀物只看見一本趙元任的「最後五分鐘」，黎錦熙的「一把椅子」，刊物只見到兩本「布丁」，國語週刊有時聊備一格，這不能不令人對國語羅馬字失望。去年出現了拉丁化的拚音法式，把它當作鬼子話而反對的人，自然是有的，但是拉丁化畢竟也是一種中國人自己說話的記號，在使用的便當，合理的基石上它已建立起來了。語文本是進化的，如果我們不以古文，骨甲文，大篆，小篆，隸書，楷書，行書，草書，手頭字的迭次演變為不當，則由「見，溪，羣，疑」到勺，文，　，由利馬竇式到威妥瑪式到國語羅馬字到拉丁化也應當認為是自然的趨勢。我們不能因此蔑視國語羅馬字創建者的功績，同時也希望這些先進們順應客觀的事實，科學的，不懷成見的共同來完成新文字的建設。</p>
<p>只有眞實的事實才能證明一切，因此我想拿一條一條的事實貢獻給讀者。我覺得國語羅馬字太做作了，它為了字是山聲韻合起來的這一個原則，不惜不顧使用的麻煩忽視了歐美活的語言中的活例而給J，Ch，sh，r，tz，ts，s加了一個y韻進去，這種畫蛇添足的辦法它自己有時也覺得是一個　瘤，而在輕聲等好聽的名詞掩護之下出現了不帶y，z　Sh等簡便的字形。</p>
<p>國語羅馬字不傀為國粹，它有五世同堂的氣慨，ji　chi　shi的家族太大了，在北方話中，大部分並不是過着那樣一種生活的。我們若果搬開「國語羅馬字常用字表」一看，便馬上可以發現至少有十五個韻母裏邊tz，ts，S完全在那里休息着，而ji　chi　shi却發生了人滿之患。在這裏拉丁化却有偉大的革新，他從各韻的ji，chi，shi大家族中領出了一支人馬去開發tz　ts　shi　shi這處女的田園，這不特能使文字更接近大衆的口頭語，而且减少了同音異義單字的數量。</p>
<p>一提到國語羅馬字，就聯想到四聲問題，這是每個稍微知道國羅內容的人常有的感覺。四聲問題的解决，是國羅學者最得意的地方。他們以為藉了這，可以減少同音異義的字數，也正是藉了這來企圖壓倒拉丁化，但是，客觀上呢，很不幸，四聲的形跡貫進了國羅，正是國羅的致命傷。這打進國羅血管中的四聲針並不是淸血的，增加抵抗力的；相反的，那是一種毒素，那要分散到國羅的全身，由足到頭，最後就嬰斷送了它的生命。如果我們將要在下邊所舉出的例証是對的，那我們就可以得出一個結論二。國羅將要死在四聲的手裏。現在我們可以條舉出四聲怎樣在腐蝕着國語羅馬字：</p>
<p>（甲）在北方各省的口頭語裏，誰都知道是打着不同的腔調，如果為了權通，同一聲調內的字，不必問牠原則上應當怎樣讀，只跟國羅呌就好了，但那也走不通，因為在北平是同調的一堆字，拿到他省便陰，陽，上，去的分了家了。誰有力量來背誦標準音表？</p>
<p>（乙）國羅是把四聲融化到字形裏邊去的，雖然只有十條規則，但是學起來可眞不容易。這裏有一個鐵的事實來証明：蕭迪沈先生某次主講的羅馬字傳習班，廿幾個大學生兩月之後只有一個人畢了業。</p>
<p>（丙）同樣字母的用處不定，有時是當聲，韻的，有時是作四聲的記號的，雖北平人也感到難記難認。</p>
<p>因此國羅不特向中國文盲大衆關了門，陌生的外國人亦將因感到繁複而裹足不前，國際化了麼？</p>
<p>拉丁化不曾把四聲裝門面，它因此受人攻擊，它亦因此而得到成功。它並不在漢字周圍兜圈子，它是依據于口頭語，而在實際使用中去解决一切問題的。它想在各省區的各自的不統一的形式下漸漸進化到了一個全國一致的民族語。所以國羅是保守的，一成不變的，偏狹的，拉丁化却是機續在向合理處變動的。它感到「有」，應該和「由，又」分開，所以特製iou以別于iu。同樣的，還把uo用到「說，國，火」，而給其他的uo韻一個〇的更簡單而容易分別</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>的形式。其他如他（Ta），她（Taa），買（maai），賣（mai），哪（naai），那（na）都是一種科學的解决方法。國羅學者認為這是頭痛治頭，脚痛治脚，將見麻煩無窮，不如制定一套四聲記號，一勞永逸。其實呢，我們正是要頭痛治頭，我們不願意頭痛的時候，給脚也吃藥。我們沒有權利因為上邊的十九個字生問題，便給一千以上的字都帶上四聲的鐐銬，何况四聲在北方話中根本就沒有統一的威權。至于將見麻煩無窮，那是憂天。拉丁　已在廣泛的被使用着了，已經有幾萬人在讀着拉丁化的報紙書籍，運用拉丁化作許多文化上的事情，沒有看見困難，沒有感到無窮的麻煩，就是國羅學者所藉以反駁拉丁化沒有四聲的流弊的例子，也只僅僅的是梨子，荔子，李子，栗子而已。目前整的詞兒連寫的法則，因此，在文字裏充滿了意義明確的詞兒，使人一見就了解。新的，完美的新文字已在發育滋長起來了。</p>
<p>最後，我拿一句話做結論：眞金子不怕火鍊，讓國語羅馬字和拉丁化在人羣之火中去試去吧！</p>

<p>— 鯉</p>
<p>華北的桃子要算是束鹿縣和深縣的「蜜桃」「喟桃」兩種圾著名；這在平津一帶，幾乎是家傳戶誦，沒有人不歡喜吃的一。所以這兩縣的桃子在華北出售的代價，就跟着人們食慾的膨脹而高漲起來，一般鄕農見了有利可圖，也就拋棄正糧不一種而都去栽植桃樹了。可是，東鹿和深縣的「桃業」，雖然已發達到了極點，但如果和我們肥城縣的「桃業」比較起來，那就無論是在桃的本質上，或桃樹的數量上，都是「瞠乎其後」的。</p>
<p>肥城是山東南部的一僩小縣，因為交通的不發達，就是有幾種特產，也不容易運銷外埠；所以桃子在這裏的產量雖多，但對於處在平津及大江以南的人們，就沒有方法可以使他們有這種好口味的享受。這裏所出的特產有「山雞」，「杏子」，和「桃子」三種：前兩種除了到過這裏的人才能知道它的好處外，在別的地方就不大聞名；只有「桃子」却頗風行於本省，尤其是在濟南。只要在濟南住過一年半載的人，大槪沒有不吃過肥城桃子的。</p>
<p>肥城好像天生成就是種桃子的地帶；其土質的肥沃，即產桃著稱的束鹿和深縣也望塵莫及。因而一般鄉農大都以種桃來代替農產正業；在全縣的村莊中，可說是沒有一家不是種有數百株桃樹的。你只要一踏進了肥城縣境，就和身入桃源般的祇看見桃林蔽日，濃蔭匝地；到了桃花開放的季節，眼看着那遍地粉紅色的世界，心裏更是有着一種說不出的美妙之感。</p>
<p>在肥城的各村莊中，產桃最多而滋味又最好的，要算是「曹莊」了。牠那裏的桃園可以說即使費了你幾點鐘的時間也還是逛不完的；其餘的村莊也都有桃園，但沒有牠那麼多的桃樹。桃樹種得多的呌「莊」，少的呌「桃行」。一個「莊」裏的桃樹，至少是有幾千株，再少就不够資格稱「莊」；「桃行」的樹數自一千多株到幾百株不等，最少也有一百多株。他們種植桃樹，大半是採用接根法；樹的軀幹極小，每株樹最高不會超過六尺。所下的肥料全是以「莖餅」為主體（因為「荳餅」的性質不乾燥）；其次則多半用水，使土質常保持適當的濕度。但桃樹到開花最盛的時期，就得停止澆水的工作，而這時所最注意的是要用泥土把樹根壓緊，使根不致受風的襲擊；如果違反了這種原則，桃子便會不等到長熟而就夭折了。另外還有颶風和毛蟲，也是摧毀桃子的魔手。當桃花將落的時期，如果遇了颶風，一樹的桃子至少是會損失一半，而他們遇着這種無妄之災，也祇有付諸天命，這就是所謂「天年歉收」。但如遇毛虫作祟，他們是可以用人工把牠消滅的；據說在桃樹根下抹上少許的石灰水，驅除毛虫很有効力。他們愛護桃子的盡心恐怕比視自己的兒女還要殷勤一點；桃子一到結實成長的時期，就得花費很多的工夫把每一個桃子用秫稭，純起來，預防樹枝的力量不勝負載桃子重量，或是抵抗不住暴風雨的襲擊。一棵樹所結的桃子大概有一百多個，但今年結了這麽多，到了明年就使沒有無妄之災的摧殘，也要受地力的限制而减少，甚至一個也不結，這在他們就是所謂「歇枝」。</p>
<p>這裏所產桃子的種類之多，恐為任何地方所不及；據他們說起來竟多到五十種，但我從一般人嘴裏所聽到的，大槪是有「扁桃」，「毛桃」，「五月桃」，「蜜桃」四種。記得有一年我在上海吃過的龍華「蟠桃」，就和這裏的「扁桃」差不多，不過這裏「扁桃」的味道比「蟠桃」還要好點。「毛桃」在江南各地所產的，形狀都小，但這裏所產的「毛桃」，事實上是比江南所產的大得多了。「五月鮮」和「蜜桃」，恐怕是這裏最有名的特產；牠所含的水份，就是深縣所產的最上等的「冷桃」，也還是沒有牠那麼鮮甜可口的。至於談到桃子形式的大小，說起來恐怕一般人都不敢相信。在平津一帶所看到的桃子，最大的不過像茶杯那麼大小，然而已經是不容易多見。上海雖是物質上應有盡有的地方，可是就連茶杯大小的桃子也還是看不到。但這裏的桃子，如飯碗那樣大小的却非常的普遍。一個桃子頂起碼的份量，足有十四兩；再重一點的，大槪是在一斤左右，所以這裏桃子出售，多數是以個數做單位。桃子的顏色也和別地不同，普通的桃子多半是紅綠相兼，就是有一種所謂「白面桃」也還是帶點淡綠色；但這裏的桃子却都是純白的，吃起來味道就像糖一般的甜蜜，如果你不留心吃一口的話，保管你滿胸滿臉都濺的是桃汁。這種桃子的確要比奉化的「水蜜桃」名符其實得多了。</p>
<p>肥城桃子最大的銷路要算是濟南，本地的銷量却很有限的，因為彼此家裏都有桃樹。每百個桃子在「桃行」出售的價錢，大約十三四元，但到了濟南就要賣到三四毛錢一個。這一方面是因為濟南的水菜行要從中漁利，另一方面是因為交通的不便，用脚夫挑到濟南要花費很大的力錢；所以在濟南就吃不到便宜的桃子。也為了交通不便這個原因，肥城桃子的風行，就祗能限於本省；而且牠的產量又多，以山東一省地方的消耗力，還是有點供過於求。於是一般「桃行」便祇有用別種方法去推廣牠的銷路，每年把產下來的桃子分做兩種，一種大而完好的就零銷於市面，一種稍小而又有點損壞的就　數售給濟南泰豐公司，製造罐頭食品。統訐每年售給泰豐的桃子，大槪不下七八千元。</p>
<p>最後，還有一段關於肥城桃子的史實也趁便來談一談，作為這篇短文的結束。肥城桃子在前淸時代，照例是要在桃子未出賣以前，由縣政府向各「桃行」徵集若干作為貢品的；但縣知事為了要討好於皇帝，往往不惜用種種的方法來選擇桃子。最普通的方法，是用一隻碗口大的鐵環，把徵集來的桃子一個個的擱在環上，那一個由鐵環裏脫落下來，那一個就不中選。這在事先已經有過試騐，凡是鐵環通不過的桃子，才足有十四兩的重量。</p>

<p>讀書是一件好事，這是人所共知的，所以中國社會歷來就流行得有一種「萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高」的哲學，而讀書人確也因此在社會上受過特殊的敬愛。可是，讀書人的黃金時代似乎已經過去，近年來社會上的人對於讀書人的觀感都大大的改變了。一方面因為這些旣不能文又不能武的人，就在大學畢了業，仍然不能發財升官，甚至失業賦閒，至於仰不足事，俯不足蓄，所以社會上大家都看不起讀書人。一個甚麼文豪和著作家，絕不能和一個銀行的買辦相比，不能受人同等的尊敬。至於他回到家庭中去，那眞如蘇秦鬧考落第歸來一樣，大有父母不以為子，嫂不以為叔，妻不以為夫之慨。他方面則又因為讀了書的人以為他無所不知，無所不曉，於是處士橫議，好論古非今，成為好亂成性的標識，大家都討厭他。因為如此，所以近年來的讀書人，在社會上成為遊手好閒的人的象徵，而許多家庭也都以繼續送子弟讀書為戒了。</p>
<p>不管過去的社會怎樣認讀書是一件好事，現今的社會却又在鄙視它，但這兩種觀點大槪都是立足在個人及其家庭的私的立場上出發，而不是立足於社會的觀點上來對牠加以評價的。因為就前一種觀點來說，完全是中國舊的社會的「學而優則仕」的社會習慣所造成的。所謂「學而優則仕」就是說個人只要把書讀好了，便可以飛黃騰達，平地登天，而達到升官發財的目的，以顯達自己和光耀門庭，所以說這種讀書的用意完全是為個人的。反之，近代普及敎育之所以發達，學校之所以日益增加，這在社會的根本要求上，原是近代資本主義需要能够負擔科學的勞動生產的工作者的結果。然而在中國的情形却又略有不同。產業的發達本已落後，而外力的束縛更使它不易進展，並且因帝國主義的榨取造成了許多家庭破產，個人失業，因之學校敎育為它培養出來的勞動生產者的數量，更遠超過它所能容納的比例，於是知識分子的失業也成為大批的了。但是，這些所謂讀書人，他個人和其家庭原也一樣是視此為飛黃騰達升官發財的途徑，現在却是先化了一大筆求學經費，而最終仍只是落得不能維持個人和家庭的生活，所以那鄙視讀書的觀念就發生了。正確地說來，這種鄙視讀書人的觀念和過去重視讀書人的觀點，仍然是一樣的出發點，卽完全只在私的利害上計較打算而已。</p>
<p>自然，我們不能說讀書完全沒有以個人的利益為目的的意義存乎其間，但我們必須知道，個人根本就不能離開社會和人羣而生活，所以個人的利益也就需要社會和大家的利益來作保証。因此，讀書的目的主要的應該建立在為社會而用的基礎上。如果籠統地只說讀書所以致用，而其致用之道却又只在為了自己個人，不是立足於為社會和人羣的致用基礎上，那麼聰明與智識的開發實在是可以啟發人類的狡詐欺騙，社會與個人將都會受所謂讀書人的擾亂和損害。</p>
<p>人類的知識遺產，原來就是社會的，它也正是為了社會的進步，人羣的利益而被保存了的。並且它還要以社會的力量，人羣的協力，才能運用那些知識去再生產。在這一點上說，人類的知識之正當的遺產，根本上就是社會的而非個人的，它只能在為社會和大衆而被利用時，才能有利於人類。所謂讀書，這原就是從語言文宇的保管與遺傳作用中，去獲取人類的知識的遺產，所以我們在承繼其知識的遺產中，同時必須承繼其為了推進社會與人羣而遺傳給我們的那種根本作用，這才能算眞正理解了讀書的本義，也才能算是眞正讀了書。顯明的事實吿訴我們，比如我們讀自然科學的書，不但這些書裏面的知識，乃是集合着自遠古到現今的人類的無數發明，成為社會的長期恊力所產生的總遺產，而且這些理論與規律又都是社會的公有物，决非任何個人可得而私之。假使人們把它承繼起來作為個人利益的營謀的工具，那社會是必然要受其害的。一個顯著的例子，便是近代自然科學被利用成為近代資本主義的生產武器，它便造成了種種社會的矛盾，造成循環不已的經濟的癱疲症，更被利用去製造和改良殺人武器，造成亘古未有的殘酷戰爭，使社會與個人均以此而蒙受極大的損害這一事實。</p>
<p>總之，讀書應以社會和人羣的福利為目的，不能抱着為個人利益的目的而讀書。因此，在我們讀書時，應該摒絕其中與社會和人羣福利相矛盾的學說，在以所學去致用時，亦不能以個人的利益為前提，而應以謀社會和人羣利益為前提。如此，則個人的利益亦自然會在社會和人羣利益的解决中一同被解决。現在的社會觀點和許多靑年，都是把讀書當作為個人謀出路的手段，亦只知道在書本中去尋求有利於個人謀利的知識，而不努力求些能為社會致用的知識，這種傾向都是錯誤的。也正因為他們有這種錯誤，所以在讀了書仍不能吃好飯穿好衣時，便根本否認讀書是有益的事體。</p>

<h3 id="c241">介紹新文字研究書籍 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 問</p>
<p>前幾天在內山書店買到了一本中文拉丁化研究會出版的「中國話寫法拉丁化」，讀後使我戚到極大的興趣。這是我第一次看見的關於拉丁化較有系統的研究書籍。這本書對於熟心從事識字運動的人很有帮助，其內容包含：「中文拉丁化槪說」，「中文拉丁化的原則」，「北方話拉丁化的詳細方案」，「拉丁化和知識份子的使命」，以及附錄「拉丁化漢文對譯讀物」等六大章。這本小書簡明地解答了許多問題，使讀者只要看過一遍，就能够對於拉丁化得到一個頗明確的了解。</p>
<p>在第一章「中文拉丁化槪說」裏，作者答覆了一般對於拉丁化懷疑和反對的人們，說明拉丁化不只是簡單而易學的文字，而且是大衆的語文工具。並且還批評了歷來對於中國漢字改良運動（注音字母和國語羅馬字）的缺點和不合理的地方。這篇文章寫得極其簡明易解，有種特殊的風格。</p>
<p>「中文拉丁化的原則」說明了只有站在科學的立塲上，才能創造出適應於現代的大衆的語文，並且指出國語運動的不可能，而在目前各區不同的方言拉丁化，是提高大衆文化水準和助成將來統一語的必經階段。牠給了研究中國語言的人們一個必需的方針。</p>
<p>「北方話拉丁化的詳細方案」一文中，包含有：字母和發音，音段的搆成，詞兒的寫法，話的寫法各章。在該文緒論裏，作者很巧妙地解說了「做文章就是說話」。這個「話的分析」對於不識字的文盲大衆是很必要的。這樣詳盡的書寫規則，連國語羅馬字也從未有過的。詞兒連寫這一章，尤其來得有意思。咱們看慣寫慣方塊字的人，粗粗一看這種連寫規則，最初也許是有些不順眼，但只要你細細一想，就可以知道這是應該而且是合理的。比方，表示所有的「的」和前邊的詞兒連寫，讀慣英語的人說不定看了會不順眼，但據我看來是極可取的。這個詞兒連寫規則中，有許多地方都是大刀闊斧地給予中國話一大膽的處理，而旦大部份都已證實了這種嘗試業已獲得了成功。虛心讀完這本小書的人是會和我發生同感的。</p>
<p>「拉丁化和知識份子的使命」這篇短文，吿訴了我們應該怎樣把文字交給大家，是値得細細一讀的。</p>
<p>最後的附錄，內容很有趣而切實用。幾則電報和通信更使我感到典趣。最後一篇小說「傳令的人」，是用拉丁化文字創作的文藝作品，在目前已有這樣的創作，是値得驚異的。記得了方案中的書寫規則，讀完了這部份對照的讀物，再去看報作文，是不會感到多少困難的了。</p>
<p>這本七十七頁的小書，定價不過二角五分，本埠北四川路底內山書店有售，凡有意研究中國語文問題的人，是値得買來一讀的。</p>
<p>專述</p>
<h3 id="c242">華僑在全世界（一） <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>（一）中國人是怎梯走到世界上去的？</p>
<p>中國之與西歐各國通往來，歷史頗久；至於南洋的許多國家，如安南，緬甸等，從前本是中國的屬地，因之南洋與中國的關係當然是更古的。不過，中國之眞正殖民世界各國，華僑之在世界各處出現的事情，可以說是在西歐資本主義侵入中國與世界各處以後發生的。</p>
<p>過去中國的經濟，乃是農業，手工業和商業的經濟，　種經濟形態在近代資本主義勢力侵入之後，必然要發生崩潰。在這個崩潰中，使許多農民和手工業者都不能保守其原有的工作和其生活形式，因之便不得不離開自己的居住地而走到他處去找尋出路。但是，中國固有的經濟形態雖因資本主義的侵入而迅速地崩潰，但新的工業却未能與此崩潰的速度成比例地發展起來，因此不能容納從農村中出來的大批的農民和手工業者，使他們又不得不走出國外去求生路。不消說當時已經有了到各處去的輪船，交通比較便利，由中國到世界各處去也比較容易，於是，到美洲做工，到南洋經商，到非洲開荒，……世界各處都漸漸有中國人出現了。依此我們可以說中國之殖民世界各處，與歐美各先進國家乃至與××的都不同：它們是由於本國資本主義的發展而殖民世界，我們則是由於外國資本主義勢力的侵入，由於本國經濟的畸形發展而使許多國民不得不走到世界上去找生路的；它們是借着國家的經濟的政治的乃至軍事的力量以殖民世界，我們則是許多國民在它們的侵略之下，無法生活而自動地走到世界上去謀生的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Yangtze River Water Level Presents a Dangerous Situation; All Parties Are Striving to Protect and Rescue; Zhang Xueliang Leads Personnel to Inspect the Various Dikes; The Headquarters Will Hold a Flood Prevention Conference Today <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Yangtze River's water level has been rising continuously in recent days, gradually presenting a dangerous situation. However, thanks to the authorities' efforts in protection and rescue, no danger has yet emerged. The Han River's water level has reached the same height as the dikes. The terrain in the second special district of Hankou is extremely low, and the sewer system has been blocked. Pumping work began on the 6th. The water barrier dam gates have started to be blocked with yellow earth. Here are the flood prevention updates from various sources, recorded as follows. Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, went to western Hubei to inspect the dikes. On the 5th, he telegraphed the provincial government to report on the situation at Xiachewan and Jiangjia'nao, briefly stating that the Jingjiang River's water level was very bad, the water was about to overflow the dikes, and leaks were found in the dikes themselves. Fortunately, effective rescue efforts prevented any danger. He also consulted with the Magistrate of Jianli County to requisition labor and raise the main dikes along the river to be two meters higher than the water surface. Another telegram stated that on the evening of the 4th, the water level at Xindi was only a foot lower than the high water level of 1931. The Magistrate of Jianli County telegraphed the provincial government on the 5th, reporting that the water level on the 3rd was equal to the flood level of 1931. The Magistrate of Gong'an County telegraphed the provincial government on the 5th, stating that the water level in the county had exceeded the flood level of 1931 by one foot and was continuing to rise. If it rises another foot, it will be impossible to provide relief. Furthermore, Zhang Qun in Shanghai is very concerned about flood prevention matters and specifically telegraphed the Provincial Government Secretary Sun Ji to report the water situation. It is also heard that Zhang has gone to Nanjing and is returning to Hubei at top speed to oversee flood prevention matters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Director Zhang of the Headquarters has scheduled a flood prevention meeting for the 7th, bringing together provincial, municipal, military, and political authorities to discuss flood prevention plans and intensive work. Zhang Qun went to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 6th and will return to Hankou immediately to oversee risk prevention. The police department has ordered the naval and land military police to strictly prevent traitors from digging dikes. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water rose seven inches on the 6th, reaching a water mark of 47.6. The inner lakes of Wuchang are overflowing. The Wufeng Gate, Yujia Road, Hejia Road, Yangsiji, Jiangjiadun, San'gong Road, Zhanggong Temple, Renjia Road, Laodaokou, and all nine dikes are in danger. The Jinshui Gate and Heng dike are leaking. The collapse of Gehu Dike and Qipanzhou Dike is very extensive. The Zhanggong Dike in Hankou is being reinforced in sections. The upstream water is still rising. Yichang has been flooded, and thousands of residences of nearby residents have been flooded. The entire village of Xiaoxita was destroyed, and many people and animals were drowned. The disaster situation is dire. The dike bodies along the Xindi area of Jiangkou have all reported danger. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) In recent days, the river water has been rising rapidly, and there has been excessive rainfall upstream and downstream, resulting in surging waves. The water level has now exceeded the record of 1931. Although the dikes along the coast have been raised compared to the past, if the rise continues unabated, collapse is still a concern. Director Zhang of the Headquarters is extremely concerned about this and has repeatedly instructed Chen Zhenxian, Director of the Sixth Section, to inspect the dikes around Wuhan at any time and to review all documents and telegrams regarding water level reports from all parties daily. He is now planning to convene a flood prevention meeting. On the morning of the 6th, at 10:00 a.m., he personally led Director Chen, Technical Official and Section Chief Yang Jingzhen, and others, crossing the river at Wenchang Gate, landing at Jianghan Customs, and traveling by car up to Qiaokou along Zhanggong Dike, passing through Gusaoshu and Dajia Mountain to Chenjiaji, before turning back along the riverbank from Danshui Pool. Along the way, they saw that the water had already reached the shore. Fearing that insufficient protection would repeat the disaster of 1931, they decided to first convene the various organs and troops in Wuhan, as well as the Wuyang Hankou Chamber of Commerce, and scheduled a flood prevention meeting for 8:00 a.m. on the 7th in the assembly hall of the Headquarters. Major issues such as emergency repairs, disaster relief, defense, and transportation will be thoroughly discussed at the meeting. In addition to the heads or deputy heads of the First, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Sections of the Headquarters, the Army Reorganization Office, the Political Training Office, the Transportation Office, and the Health Office, as well as Brigade Commander Tan of the 105th Division, the participants will include Director He of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Commander Zeng of the Navy, the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Construction, the Security Office, the Water Police Bureau, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the Wuchang Municipal Office, the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, the Hankou Municipal Government, the Municipal Police Bureau, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the First Regiment of the Military Police, responsible persons from the Wuyang Xia San Chamber of Commerce, and the governments of Wuchang and Hanyang Counties. The meeting plan was drafted by the Sixth Section of the Headquarters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jianghan Engineering Bureau telegraphed that Hancheng Yuan, one of the three Yuan folk dikes repaired with provincial government loans, is a massive project that cannot be completed in one go. It is currently unfinished, so there is no collapse to speak of, nor is it related to the main dikes. The Jianghan Bureau's flood prevention work has long been prepared separately, and all dikes are currently safe. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission plans to establish special flood prevention offices in Hankou, Jiujiang, and Anqing. It has ordered the dispatch of Yang Jian, head of the First Survey Team, and Shao Yintang, deputy engineer, to first establish a flood prevention office in Jiujiang. The remaining offices will be prepared successively. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the water levels at various locations on the 6th were: Wanxian 11.65 meters, Yichang 13.75 meters, Shashi 10.71 meters, Yuezhou 15.31 meters, Jiujiang 13.381 meters, Anqing 11.98 meters. There has been no change in the past three days. However, the water level in Hankou has risen to 14.04 meters. The flood record for the same day in 1931 was 16.3 meters. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission has recently dispatched three engineers, Wang Ruilin to Hankou, Dong Wangqi to Anhui, and Yang Jian to Xun, to provide long-term assistance, departing on the morning of the 6th, due to the rapid rise in the Yangtze River's water level. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Commission, upon hearing that the entire Hanyang Hancheng Yuan had collapsed due to the rising Yangtze River, specifically telegraphed the Jianghan Engineering Bureau for a detailed report. According to the bureau's telegram on the 6th, Hancheng Yuan is one of the three Yuan dikes. The project is huge and cannot be completed in a short time. It is currently unfinished, so there is no collapse to speak of, nor is it related to the main dikes. The Jianghan Bureau's flood prevention work, in addition to strict precautions, is all safe. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level has now reached 47.3 feet and seems to be still rising slightly. Yesterday, Yichang suddenly rose eight and a half feet, but it has receded four feet today, which is a good sign. It is heard that there was heavy rain upstream for three days, but the water level did not rise as violently as expected. Shashi, Changsha, and other places have risen slightly. Every day, Chinese people gather by the river in Hankou to observe the water level. What everyone is talking about is the possibility of flooding, but everything remains as usual. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Tonight, the water level in Hankou reached 47.6 feet. The situation is normal and does not seem to cause serious panic. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">The River Water at Xiaguan is Only a Foot Away from the Dike; Water Has Reached the Shore in Low-lying Areas <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The river water at Xiaguan is still about a foot away from the dike, about three city feet different from the flood of 1931.

<p>(Nanjing) Shen Honglie, Mayor of Qingdao, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, stating that most of the depositors of Qingdao Minghua Bank are people of the middle class and below. After the bank closed, the Ministry of Finance sent Qiu Qingli, a liquidator from the Central Bank, to Qingdao for investigation. However, the money is all the hard-earned savings of the depositors, and the people are extremely indignant. He requested the Ministry of Finance to order the head office to repay the Qingdao savings in advance to avoid further complications. The Executive Yuan forwarded the matter to the Ministry of Finance on the 6th for expeditious handling. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Changes in the Gold Price Conversion Rate for International Postage <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Directorate General of Posts previously determined that the standard gold price for international postage would be revised when the gold price fluctuated by one-tenth of the original rate due to the instability of gold prices. Recently, the gold price has gradually declined, falling by two-tenths compared to the previously set conversion rate. Therefore, the current conversion rate of each gold franc from one yuan in national currency to eight jiao in national currency will be revised. A telegram was sent to the Swiss Postal Administration to forward it to the International Postal Union to notify the postal administrations of various countries, and to instruct postal bureaus in various regions of the country to implement it accordingly.

<h3 id="e33">Further Explanation for Joint Operations <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Recently, manufacturers have been engaging in joint operations. First, the China and Shanghai flexible tube factories established a joint business office. More recently, the Dachunghua, Zhengda, Zhongguo, Tongsui, Huai Shang, Dahua, Minsheng, and Daming eight match companies jointly formed the Domestic Match Manufacturing Industry Joint Office to centrally handle production and sales matters. It is undeniable that the purpose of these two joint operations is to eliminate illegal price competition among the same industry and to adjust production. It can be asserted that, as a result of competition among the same industry, those with more abundant capital can rely on their advantages to find ways to eliminate smaller competitors and seek a monopoly of the market. In reality, given the current situation in our country, this kind of grand ambition is hardly permissible. The endless rise and fall of small factories would have to be dealt with one by one. Not only would the losses be too great, but it would also be difficult to devise a good strategy to sweep them all away. Ultimately, everyone will be exhausted and suffer losses, only to allow others to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>There have been many precedents for joint operations in China's business community, with the shipping industry having the longest history. Early examples of cooperation with foreign companies include the Yangtze River Public Ticket Bureau and the Sichuan River Water Freight Alliance. All of these have become historical relics. The recent revenue sharing of the Yangtze River Six Companies is the latest development. Joint operations are also important for supporting many domestic shipping lines. Examples include the Shen-Tai Line (Shanghai to Haimen), where the Taizhou, Zhoushan, Ping'an, Chuanshan, Daxing, and Yili six companies jointly formed the United Shipping Bureau; the Shen-Sha Line (Shanghai to Qidong), where the Dada, Jufeng, Daxing, Ping'an, and Yuxing five companies jointly formed the Shanghai-Qidong Shipping Cooperative; and the Shen-Yang Line (Shanghai to Yangzhou), where the revenue sharing of the Dada and Tong two companies and the joint establishment of the Datong Small Wheel Public Bureau. As for the industrial sector, industries such as enamel and cement were previously united, but all terminated their agreements for various reasons. Currently, in addition to the flexible tube and match industries, the steel essence, paperboard, and electric fan industries are maintaining a joint operation. The domestic paperboard industry has been the most successful. Since adopting the joint operation strategy, the business of each factory has reached unprecedented records, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>It is clear that the purpose of joint operations is to promote the co-existence and co-prosperity of the same industry. At the beginning of their unity, they must have felt the pain of past competition, and then sought to work together to formulate a business agreement and rectify the front lines of the same industry. However, observing the history of failures of joint operations, there are many cases where the failure was due to a few manufacturers breaking the agreement and competing. There are also cases where the person in charge had other ambitions, using the joint operation as a slogan and the joint organization as a tool to secretly monopolize the business. As a result, the distribution of business was not fair, and the rise and fall of business depended on private interests, only increasing the burden of participating manufacturers without contributing to the actual situation. Those who were exploited endured the pain and accepted it due to the limitations of the agreement. Once the contract expires, how can they expect it to continue? As a result, the conflict of competition within the same industry will reopen. Therefore, the greatest difficulty in joint operations is not the success of the agreement, but how to maintain cooperation in order to achieve sustainability. The prerequisite for sustainability is that the person in charge must put aside private prejudices and interests, and prioritize the business above all else. The articles of agreement must be adhered to without wavering, and business strategies should be openly and honestly discussed to jointly address challenges. Otherwise, even if joint operations are temporarily successful, the future divisions between the same industries will be created by this.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The joint air defense exercise of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kawasaki began at 2:00 PM on the 6th. On the morning of the same day, due to the danger of diplomatic relations between Japan and a certain country, the government implemented an air defense order, and the citizens were extremely tense. At 2:00 PM, the Defense Command suddenly announced the severance of diplomatic relations and declared war. At the same time, sirens wailed, ordering citizens to engage in air defense. The various agencies of the Supervisory Department immediately began to take action. At 3:00 PM, enemy planes attacked, and anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, etc., vigorously defended. Smoke screens were released throughout the city to conceal the capital. In the evening, the war of attack and defense intensified, and the command ordered the lights to be turned off, turning the entire city into a dark world. Prince Asaka, Commander of the Konoe Division, inspected the security status inside and outside the Imperial Palace by car at 9:00 PM. (6th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Home Affairs is currently planning to construct an undersea railway between Busan, Korea, and Kyushu, Japan. According to reports, the project will cost 1.5 billion yuan and will be completed in 20 years. It will start from Busan, pass through Tsushima Island, and reach Karatsu in Saga Prefecture, with a total length of 145 kilometers. The Seventh Forestry Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs plans to start investigating the specific matters in the near future. (6th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Soviet Russia Did Not Accept the Proposal to Establish a Joint Committee; Russian Ambassador Re-visits Hirota to Clarify <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russian Ambassador Yurenev re-visited Foreign Minister Hirota at 10:40 AM on the 6th, stating that the contents of the Hirota-Yurenev talks reported by the Japanese side on the 5th differed from the instructions he received from his government. The Russian government only expressed the same opinion as Japan on the issue of establishing a mediation committee for border disputes between Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo." The Japanese side's claim that the committee is a joint dispute committee between Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo" is fundamentally contrary to the Russian side's policy. This specific matter should be studied together in the future. The Russian side did not agree to Foreign Minister Hirota's proposal. Foreign Minister Hirota understood his words. The Russian ambassador left at 12:30 PM. From this, it can be seen that the Russian side hopes to establish a mediation committee between Japan and Russia or between "Manchukuo" and Russia, and does not support a joint mediation committee between Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo." (6th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota and Russian Ambassador Yurenev met on the 5th to exchange opinions on the establishment of a committee to handle border disputes between Japan, "Manchukuo," and Russia. The points that have been agreed upon will be studied by the authorities of the three countries. After each party's attitude is determined, specific negotiations will begin. The location is likely to be in Tokyo. (6th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' internal plan for the joint committee will be compared and examined with the Soviet Union's internal plan before making a final decision, namely: (1) establish a central committee in Harbin, and establish local committees in Suifenhe, Daheihe, Dongning, Manzhouli, and other places; (2) in the event of a dispute, the local committee shall in principle first negotiate to resolve it. If it cannot be resolved, it shall be transferred to the central committee, and if it still cannot be resolved, it shall be transferred to diplomatic negotiations; (3) the committee shall be organized by representatives of the three governments and military commissioners. (6th Denstu News Agency)</p>
<p>Japan will negotiate troop withdrawal</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of establishing a joint committee will be resolved and specific negotiations will begin within days. However, the reason for the border disputes between Russia and "Manchukuo" is due to the unclear border line between Russia and "Manchukuo" and the concentration of large numbers of Soviet Russian troops on the border. Foreign Minister Hirota decided to discuss the delimitation of the border line and the issue of border guards at the same time when the three-nation committee was established. Since the Manchurian Incident, Soviet Russia's troop increase in the Far East has become increasingly significant. There are currently 230,000 troops and 700 tanks, which has created a tense atmosphere on the border. Therefore, Japan intends to demand that Soviet Russia reduce its troops to one-third and, at the same time, demarcate the border due to the establishment of a new border committee in order to eliminate the root of the problem.

<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry today issued the following statement regarding the illegal arrest of surveyor Inukai and negotiations with Outer Mongolia: On July 4, regarding the illegal intrusion of Outer Mongolian troops into "Manchukuo" territory to arrest surveyor Inukai and insult Japanese military personnel, the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry, through the Manzhouli Outer Mongolian representative, lodged a formal protest to the Outer Mongolian government. The content of the protest, from the perspective of preventing this from happening again in the future and preventing expansion, focused on maintaining the friendly relations between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia. If Outer Mongolia shows sincerity, this matter can be easily resolved. (6th Denstu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The formal protest from the Kwantung Army Command and the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry regarding the arrest of surveyor Inukai was delivered to the Manzhouli Outer Mongolian representative on the 5th. The Outer Mongolian representative immediately telegraphed his government for instructions. However, due to the inconvenience of communication facilities, it will take about ten days for the reply to arrive. (6th Denstu News Agency)</p>

<p>(London) It was rumored that Sir Ross, a consultant to the Ministry of Finance, would detour through the United States in August when he went to China to investigate the financial situation to exchange views with people from that country. It is now known that Ross's trip to the United States has been cancelled. Financial circles here believe that Ross originally intended to discuss the issue of exchange rate stability between the pound and the US dollar with the US government. However, because the United States' attitude towards the conditions proposed by the United Kingdom remains the same as before, the timing of this conversation is not yet ripe, so the trip to the United States has been suspended.

<h3 id="e42">Extraordinary Development in the Silver Market: Large-Scale Sales from China and India, Purchased by the United States <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today marks an unusual development in the history of the silver market. On Sundays, the silver market usually settles around noon, but today it was delayed until 2:46 PM in the afternoon. This morning, brokers received orders for large-scale sales from India and China, especially India. If the price were settled according to these orders, the market price would have fallen sharply. The brokers felt that this price did not truly reflect the market situation, so they returned to their offices to await news from the United States. When they reunited in the afternoon, the United States had entered the market and engaged in purchasing, absorbing the sales from the East. Therefore, the spot price only fell by 3.125, and the closing market price can be said to be stable. (6th Reuters)</p>
<p>Bombay The silver price in the Bombay market has fallen by about eight rupees in the past month. It is generally believed that the United States has now definitively decided to only absorb silver in the London market when the price falls, rather than bid to buy it. This is the main reason for the fall in the silver market price. This speculation does not seem to be groundless, as according to the daily silver market report in London, the United States buys almost every day, but only below a certain value. Since the United States has adopted the policy of buying when cheap and shrinking when expensive, bullish speculators here will continue to close out positions. At its core, the silver market is not weak, but it lacks real assistance. If the United States, in addition to buying when cheap, expresses assistance to the silver market, the market situation will definitely be stable. (6th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) During the week ending July 3, the United Kingdom's silver exports increased, while imports decreased. The total value of exports was £586,000, of which £526,000 was shipped to the United States and £48,000 was shipped to New Zealand, which is £399,000 more than the previous week's exports. The total value of imports was £515,000, of which £325,000 came from Japan, £71,000 from Soviet Russia, £29,000 from the Netherlands, £22,000 from France, and £20,000 from Belgium, which is £335,000 less than the previous week's imports. After offsetting this week's silver exports and imports, the net export value is £71,000, while the previous week's silver import surplus was £663,000. (5th Reuters)</p>

<p>(Washington) The United States announced today that it trusts both Italy and Abyssinia, but does not want to actively participate in the conflict in Africa. This was the decision made after a cabinet meeting to discuss the Abyssinian government's application. After the meeting, President Roosevelt consulted with Secretary of State Hull for an hour before publishing the official reply to the King of Abyssinia, stating that the United States fully trusts both countries and firmly believes that both countries will abide by their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The reply avoided formally invoking the non-aggression pact, only stating that the dispute is currently being arbitrated by the League of Nations, and it is hoped that the League of Nations' intervention can lead to a satisfactory resolution of the case. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Abyssinia’s request that the United States invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact to restrain Italy has been effectively rejected by the United States. After receiving the telegram, the U.S. government immediately replied, saying that it was very pleased that the League of Nations was paying attention to the dispute and that the United States secretly believed that Italy and Abyssinia would not seek a solution by means other than peaceful ones, which would lead to a situation that contradicts the provisions of the non-aggression pact. The reply did not mention any actions that the United States could take. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>The Hague The Italian-Abyssinian Mixed Arbitration Committee continued to meet today in Scheveningen. Professor Cice, a professor of law at the University of Paris, attended as a lawyer hired by the Abyssinian government. According to the border conflict cases between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland, there is more than one incident, and the Walwal incident in December last year is the center of the debate. Regarding this incident, the Abyssinian side cited the 1908 Italian-Abyssinian treaty and maps published in Italy to prove that Walwal is 100 kilometers away from the Italian Somaliland border, so the area naturally belongs to Abyssinian territory. The 1908 Italian-Abyssinian treaty stipulated that the borders of Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland would be jointly delineated by the two countries. Subsequently, the mixed border demarcation committee of the two countries began work in 1910. Before long, the demarcation work was suspended because the Abyssinian government did not recognize Walwal as a disputed border area. After the Walwal incident occurred, Italian representative Baron Aloisi declared in Geneva that Italy was prepared to carry out border surveys after the current dispute was resolved, but would not allow border surveys to be held during the arbitration period. At that time, Professor Cice, in the name of the Abyssinian government, argued in Geneva that, according to the provisions of the Italian-Abyssinian treaty and the border agreement between the two countries, the arbitration committee should consider various circumstances that could affect the resolution of the dispute, and therefore the border issue between the two countries could also be considered by the arbitration committee. Today, Professor Cice defended the Abyssinian government, trying to prove that Walwal originally belonged to Abyssinian territory. However, the Italian side believed that even if, after border surveys, Walwal was determined to be Abyssinian territory, the Abyssinian invasion of Italian troops in Walwal in December last year could not reduce its serious responsibility, because Italian troops had been stationed in Walwal for many years.

<p>(London) International jurists are studying in Geneva the legality of blocking the Suez Canal to restrain Italy. According to the jurists, according to the regulations of the Suez Canal Company, the canal cannot be blocked to any belligerent country. However, according to Article 20 of the League of Nations Covenant, members of the League of Nations have agreed separately that the acceptance of the Covenant cancels all obligations that conflict with the provisions of the Covenant. Therefore, the jurists generally recognize that if the Council of the League of Nations announces a ban on the transport of arms to Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, it has the right to order the search of ships passing through the Suez Canal and confiscate all goods that violate the ban. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol will go to London next week and may discuss the issue with the British authorities. As for whether the Council of the League of Nations will pass this ban, it is still a big question. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>

It is reported that this decision was made because the balance of naval power in Europe has changed. The most important factor is Germany's plan to strengthen its fleet.

If France expands its navy, Italy will follow suit. What Italy wants is to strive for naval power equal to that of France.

<p>(Paris) The chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee, Perth, today, following Herriot and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Berenger, advocated that direct Franco-German negotiations are the only way out of the current chaotic international situation. Perth told a reporter from Le Petit Journal that he has always advocated direct Franco-German negotiations, because today's Hitler represents the majority of the German people, and direct negotiations with him will certainly not be without results. If we can see this point and negotiate with Germany as soon as possible, the environment will naturally be more favorable than it is today, but if we delay further, the more we delay, the more difficult it will be. He is well aware that it does not seem like the right time to negotiate with Germany today, but after the Anglo-German London negotiations, our actions can be said to be above reproach. Furthermore, negotiations with Germany cannot be said to reach the realm of extreme friendship, or even reach the goal of immediate disarmament. However, he firmly believes that if we want to achieve true disarmament, Franco-German coordination must come first. Only in this way can we truly alleviate the tension between the two countries, especially the best way to do this is to negotiate with Hitler himself. Finally, Perth claimed that, for the sake of France's interests, he advocated direct Franco-German negotiations and believed that it would not be difficult for the two countries to reach an agreement.

<p>(Berlin) According to a government gazette published today, German criminal law has undergone fundamental changes. The first article of the new criminal law stipulates that anyone who violates existing laws or any regulations in the future will be punished. The clauses in the new criminal law regarding military service are particularly strict. Citizens within the military service age of 18 to 45, regardless of whether they have served in the military or not, must be detained for one to six months if they leave the country without government permission, and attempts to do so will also be punished. Anyone who incites soldiers to desert from the military or induces German people to serve in the military for other countries will be sentenced to penal servitude for up to ten years. Anyone who injures their body to avoid military service will be sentenced to one year of detention. As for those who damage military supplies in the military, the punishment will range from one month of detention to the death penalty, depending on the seriousness of the circumstances. Those who endanger transportation agencies are regarded as endangering public safety and life. Whether the victim is one person or only material is damaged, the punishment will range from life imprisonment to the death penalty, depending on the seriousness of the circumstances. Anyone who publicly damages the reputation of the National Socialist Party and its affiliated organizations or its party flags and emblems, or uses various methods to make them despised, will be punished with detention. The punishment for homosexual love has also been greatly increased. In times of emergency or when public safety is endangered, those who intentionally avoid obligations that should be provided from the standpoint of national consciousness, or who stand by and watch after being summoned by the police, will be punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances, ranging from fines to imprisonment for up to two years. Restrictions on publication remain largely the same and are extended separately, ranging from six months to one year. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

According to the "Attack Report," the letter stated, "I am ordered by God to pray for the salvation of the souls of the German people. I cannot abandon my mission to save the world by joining the army. I am a son of God, so I cannot wear a military uniform, and especially cannot wear the swastika badge of paganism." He is an assistant at a seminary, and according to conscription laws, he can be exempted from military service, so the court cannot convict him. Therefore, the court sentenced him to four months in prison on the charge of "insulting the army and the national emblem." (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e93">Flood Threat: Wuhan in Extreme Panic; Dangerous Embankments Lead to Mass Evacuations; Upstream Levee Breaches, Shashi Submerged <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer this year, excessive rainfall has caused the Yangtze and Han Rivers to rise. The rise has been particularly rapid in the last ten days. The current water level of the Han River is 46 feet 9 inches, only 1 foot 1 inch away from the critical level. The upstream water level continues to rise, creating a tense situation akin to the eve of the great flood twenty years ago. In Wuchang, Baishazhou near Wanghui Bridge has been completely submerged due to the river water flooding in and the ditches overflowing. An area of six or seven li from east to west has become a watery expanse. This area is inhabited by poor people, some of whom have abandoned their homes and fled, while others have taken refuge on the roofs of their houses. The number of victims is very large, and their cries are deafening and unbearable to witness. The most critical Wuhui Embankment, which stretches over thirty li from Qingshan to Baihushan, completely collapsed during the great flood twenty years ago. It was later repaired with a grant of 200,000 yuan from the National Economic Council. However, due to the excessive length of the embankment, less than one-third of it has been sloped, and the soil is mostly sandy and not very strong. The River Engineering Bureau and the Provincial Flood Control Committee have sent personnel to inspect it and found many leaks and dangerous areas. They are working hard to rescue it. However, even before the embankment is out of danger, the Qingshan and Fankou embankments are also in danger, and the Jiangdi Embankment on Kuaizi Street has holes and is also in imminent danger. In Hankou, the river water was only level with the bank yesterday, but today (the 5th) the riverside sidewalks are flooded, with depths ranging from inches to several inches. The sewers are being flooded due to backflow, and water carts and pumps are being used to drain them. The sluice gates of the riverside earthen embankments are mostly closed and reinforced with mud to provide protection for Hankou. The Zhanggong Embankment, which protects the city, is also in danger from Shaijiashan to Gushaoshu. People in the city are panicked, and there are many evacuations. The water level is still rising in upstream areas. The river water has flooded the shore in Shashi, and the river streets are submerged. The Chewan Embankment, which is vital for the eight counties of Tianmen and Qianjiang, has breached in several places, resulting in significant losses. The Mahua Embankment, which is jointly owned by the three downstream provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, is also in extreme danger. Overall, the situation upstream and downstream is far from optimistic. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Anhui Province Intensifies Flood Prevention; Liu Zhenhua and Miao Peicheng Inspect the River Embankments; Streamline Transportation Facilities to Assist <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The water level of the Yangtze River continues to rise. Wuhu and various counties and towns along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province have mostly been flooded, with depths ranging from one to two feet, and even the shallowest areas reaching the ankles. Various places along the inland rivers, as well as the Huizhou and Ningguo areas, have experienced flash floods and sudden rises in river levels. Cities and towns such as Xuancheng and Tunxi have been completely flooded, and transportation has been disrupted. After receiving reports from various quarters about the flood situation, the provincial government fears that the great flood of twenty years ago will recur. Therefore, flood prevention efforts are extremely urgent. Chairman Liu Zhenhua and Anhui-Jiangxi District Inspector Miao Peicheng, in order to understand the actual conditions of the embankments in various places and the water levels upstream and downstream of the Yangtze River, departed on the afternoon of the 4th with the two directors of the Civil and Construction Departments, Ma Lingfu and Liu Yiyan, and Commissioner Chu Weijing, to inspect the area. The sections have been properly assigned. The upstream section will be inspected by the two directors, Liu and Ma. The downstream section will be inspected by the Censor Miao, Chairman Liu, and Wen Yi, a technician from the Construction Department. The Huai River will be inspected by Commissioner Chu and Xu Shixiong, the section chief of the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. After Liu and Miao departed from the province on the Anfeng patrol boat, they inspected the dangerous locations along the way, such as Majiawo, Meigeng, and Pangxieshi, one by one, and instructed the people to prevent floods. On the evening of the 4th, they arrived at Lugang Town, fifteen li away from Wuhu, and summoned the commissioner of the Second District, Gao Wenbo, and the magistrates of Fanchang and Wuwei Counties to inquire about the flood prevention situation in detail and give instructions. At noon on the 5th, they sailed to Wuhu and then went downstream to inspect the area along the river. The intensity of Anhui Province's flood prevention efforts can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Since the winter of last year, the provincial government has ordered various counties to repair and strengthen the embankments. Recently, due to continuous rain and rising water levels in the Yangtze, Huai, and other rivers and lakes, the air pressure in various places has been very low, and heavy rain is inevitable. All the fields and houses depend on the protection of the embankments. Without strict defense, it will be impossible to maintain safety. Regarding the Yangtze River embankments, the "Outline of Flood Prevention Measures" resolved by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission has been consulted, and various counties along the river have been notified to comply. Strict attention should also be paid to other embankments. A telegram was sent to Wuhu, Huaining, and other counties the other day, instructing them to immediately supervise the personnel responsible for the embankments to quickly assign laborers and organize embankment protection teams to patrol and repair the embankments in shifts. At the same time, they were instructed to quickly prepare flood control materials for use at any time. All water accumulated within the embankments should be diverted into low-lying ponds or pumped out with waterwheels to avoid damage to the crops. If the personnel responsible fail to comply or delay compliance, causing danger, they will be severely punished by the county magistrate in accordance with the flood control case of 1933. The county magistrates should also personally inspect the embankments at any time and send more cadres to conduct inspections everywhere, give prior warnings, and urge them to do their best to prevent floods as early as possible. In case of negligence, they will be severely punished in accordance with the flood control case of 1933. Furthermore, in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan and the letter from the National Economic Council regarding the three points that the Yangtze River Flood Control Conference, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the Yangtze River Flood Control Work should pay attention to in terms of manpower, materials, and transportation, in the case of transportation, it was originally stated that "in the emergency period of flood control, the most important thing is the communication of information and the convenience of transportation. The reporting of water levels and the replenishment of materials are all important. All existing transportation facilities in the provinces along the river, such as long-distance telephones, highways, railways, telegrams, as well as waterways and steamships on neighboring embankments, and land motor vehicles, should be consulted with the competent authorities in advance to facilitate transportation." This is essential for flood prevention. Please instruct that when flood prevention is necessary, full convenience should be given to the flood prevention agencies along the river for transmitting messages and transporting materials. It is ordered that the subordinate agencies should assist in this matter. After receiving the order, the provincial government instructed the Highway Bureau and the Wuhu, Dangtu, Wuwei, and Guichi radio stations to comply. (5th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: When the bandit suppression campaign in Jiangxi Province made progress last year, anti-bandit relief committees were established in the recovered areas and semi-bandit areas to assist in the progress of rural cleansing, disaster relief, pacification, and equalization. Now that the banditry has been quelled in various places and the first phase of post-disaster relief work has been completed, the provincial government has ordered all counties to abolish the rural cleansing and relief committees uniformly in the 23rd year of the Republic. However, in Hengfeng, Wuyuan, Dexing, Yiyang, Shangrao, Qianshan, Guangchang, Shicheng, Xingguo, Ruijin, Huichang, and Ningdu Counties, because a small number of residual bandits have not yet been eliminated, the rural cleansing and relief committees in these counties are allowed to be extended until the 20th year of the Republic.

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Among the construction projects in Fujian Province in the 23rd year of the Republic, the fastest progress was made in the construction of roads. The main lines connecting Fujian with western Jiangxi and Guangdong Provinces have been completed, and the main line from Fuzhou in eastern Fujian to Quanzhou in southern Fujian has also been officially opened to traffic. Therefore, transportation in the hinterland is extremely convenient. According to the statistics released by the Construction Department, the total length of roads built in the province in the 23rd year of the Republic was 2,429 kilometers. Of these, 1,470 kilometers have been officially opened to traffic, 488 li are under construction, and 471 kilometers are scheduled to be built in the 24th year of the Republic. A total of 678,400 yuan was spent on construction in the 23rd year of the Republic, half from the provincial treasury and half from the National Economic Council. The construction budget for the 24th year of the Republic is being discussed by the Director of the Construction Department, Chen Ticheng, with the National Economic Council, requesting an increase in the allocation to facilitate expansion. The largest project currently underway is the main line from Yanping in northern Fujian, passing through Sha County, Yong'an, Liancheng, to Longyan in western Fujian. The road is divided into four sections. The first section from Yanping to Sha County and the fourth section from Liancheng to Longyan have been completed. Most of the second section from Sha County to Yong'an has also been completed. The unfinished part is a hundred-odd feet of rock cliff from Chengtou to Yangkoushi, and a hundred-odd meters of dangerous rock from the entrance of Taoyuandong to Banweixia. There are currently more than 200 mountain openers, more than 1,000 bridge and culvert workers, more than 1,000 military engineers, and more than 300 civilian workers working overtime. If there is no rain, the entire road will be open to traffic in mid-July. As for long-distance buses, there are 280 passenger cars, 85 freight cars, and 29 chartered cars. The routes in northern and western Fujian are state-owned, while the routes in southern Fujian are privately owned, but they are also controlled by the Motor Vehicle Management Office of the Construction Department. In addition, the long-distance telephone line construction project has been completed for 990 li, with 186 li unfinished and 327 li planned. (July 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Ordnance Department Investigates Walnut Tree Planting in Shandong Province; Construction Department Provides Detailed Report <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province is rich in mountains and forests and produces a wide variety of fruits and trees. Among them, the walnut tree is particularly famous. The wood of this tree can be used as a raw material for the manufacture of military equipment. The Ordnance Department of Nanjing has sent a letter to the Shandong Construction Department requesting details on the planting situation, planting plans, or research records of walnut trees, and asking for these to be sent as much as possible, as well as information on the production areas, sales locations, and annual production, sales volume, and value of the trees. The department has now prepared a letter in reply, which is reproduced in full as follows: "Construction Department Official Letter No. 1140: In response to your department's official letter requesting that the planting situation, planting plans, or research records of walnut trees in the province's forest farms be sent as much as possible, and that the production areas, sales locations, and annual production, sales volume, and value of this tree be reported in detail, etc., it is found that the Second Forestry Bureau of this province has used two methods in recent years, winter sowing and spring planting, to plant more than 20,000 walnut and mountain walnut trees in the Qingzhou Forest Farm, and the survival rate is good. Each forestry bureau is now selecting suitable mountain sites and planning to create large-scale walnut timber forests. The Forestry Promotion Committee, in order to promote the planting of walnuts, has also established a promotion nursery of 100 mu in Yidu County this spring, mainly cultivating walnut seedlings for distribution to villagers in neighboring counties for planting. As for the walnut production areas in this province, they are mostly scattered among the mountains and fields of villages in Taian, Yidu, and other counties. There are only two types, walnut and mountain walnut. Walnut accounts for nine-tenths of the total, and the purpose is to harvest the fruit. Only when the trees are old and bear little fruit is the timber felled and sold. Usually, this timber is rarely sold, so it is impossible to investigate the production and sales volume. The price of timber in the Taian area is about seven yuan for each ke (one zhang long, one cun wide, and two cun thick). In the Xishan area of Yidu, each gunstock is worth about eight jiao and seven fen of foreign currency. In response to the previous letter, the planting and sales situation of walnut trees in this province is hereby sent to your department for your reference. Sincerely, Military Administration Department Ordnance Department" (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Fujian Province Dissolves Heretical Societies and Strictly Prohibits Them Through Local Militia <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: During the years when the Red bandits were rampant in the northern and eastern counties of Fujian, farmers often organized religious societies to resist them and seek self-defense. The army also treated them with special consideration because they were able to assist in the suppression of bandits. These religious societies can be divided into four factions: (1) The Big Knife Society, which uses knives as weapons and is popular in Sha County, Yong'an, Shunchang, and Jiangle Counties; (2) The Earring Society, whose members must wear earrings and is popular in Nanping, Jian'ou, Chong'an, and Jianyang Counties; (3) The Queen Mother Society, which worships the Queen Mother of the West as its divine commander and is popular in Gutian, Pingnan, Songxi, and Zhenghe Counties; and (4) The Maitreya Society, which worships Maitreya Buddha as its divine commander and is popular in Youxi, Minqing, Yongtai, and Minhou Counties. Although the names of the above societies are different, they all set up altars to chant scriptures and wear strange costumes and talismans in battle. Each altar gathers hundreds of people, or at least a hundred people, and obeys the orders of the masters. Recently, because the societies have spread more widely, their power has become more powerful. They often gather crowds to resist paying taxes and refuse to perform labor services. When the army goes to investigate, they dare to resist arrest and fight. The provincial government has repeatedly received reports from administrative commissioners and counties in various districts, believing that these heretical societies are sufficient to disrupt the local area and obstruct government orders, and must be strictly prohibited. Yesterday, the provincial government issued a notice to all county governments, instructing them to supervise the district and township leaders to first publicize the harms of the society to the people, and persuade them to awaken and disband automatically. At the same time, they were instructed to supervise the local militia to strictly investigate and prevent the societies together with the stationed troops. If any movement is found, it must be quickly dissolved, and the leaders must be investigated and arrested and punished according to military law. If the ignorant people are still obsessed and dare to gather crowds to resist, they will be treated as bandits and severely suppressed. If they are forced to join or blindly follow, and know how to repent, the county magistrate will allow them to reform within a certain period of time, and they will be punished according to the law after the deadline. However, those who commit the crime again after reforming will be punished more severely. If the district and township leaders have knowledge of the residents within their jurisdiction joining the society and fail to report it, in addition to the jointly responsible households, the district and township leaders will be severely punished, and the district head will also be given appropriate punishment. As for residents who rent out houses or public places to the society for setting up altars and gatherings, they will be confiscated. The firearms seized from the society will be marked, registered, and distributed to the local militia for use, and all the magical items will be destroyed. It is also reported that the Red bandits in eastern Fujian, due to repeated encirclement and suppression by government troops, have lost their power and are plotting to collude with the society in Pingnan and Zhenghe to cause trouble again. Therefore, the authorities have decided to severely sanction them to curb the chaos. This also shows the desperate and reactionary actions of the Red bandits. (June 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Sino-Vietnamese Trade Treaty Nearing Completion; Shantou Goods Transshipped to Vietnam; Merchants Prepare to Resume Business <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Shantou's commerce has close ties with the Nanyang Islands. There are two organizations in Shantou for cargo transportation to Nanyang: (1) The Siamese Chamber of Commerce; and (2) The Southern Chamber of Commerce. They are organized by merchants in Chaozhou and Shantou who transport goods to Nanyang and Siam. The Siamese Chamber of Commerce has 63 basic merchant houses, and the Southern Chamber of Commerce (also known as Southern Suburb) has 45 basic merchant houses. Due to the continuous decline of Nanyang commerce and the impact of Japanese goods dumping, most of the merchants in the two chambers of commerce have suffered losses, and the volume of trade has sharply decreased. In the past, the value of goods shipped to Siam reached 20 million yuan per year, the value of goods shipped to Annam reached 15 million yuan, the value of goods shipped to various ports in Singapore reached 10 million yuan, and the value of goods shipped to northern China, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies also reached more than 10 million yuan. In recent years, taking Annam as an example, the value of exports has greatly decreased, and last year it decreased to 3 million yuan. This is because the Sino-Vietnamese Trade Treaty expired on May 16, 1930, and the signing of a new treaty and its annexes was nowhere in sight. Annam therefore treated China as a country without a treaty. The import tax on Chinese goods was increased to 100 percent, and in some cases, it was increased by 40 to 50 times. Even transit goods passing through Haiphong into Yunnan were heavily taxed. Chinese overseas citizens in Vietnam were unable to survive, and the number of unemployed increased. In the past five years, every ship arriving in Shantou has brought back hundreds of unemployed Chinese overseas citizens, reducing the number of Chinese overseas citizens in Vietnam from 500,000 to about 300,000. Vietnamese rice and goods shipped to Shantou have also decreased accordingly. From an economic point of view, both sides are suffering. In addition, the number of regular ships sailing from Shantou to Saigon and Haiphong has decreased from five or six to only two, Yuanli and Taipingyang. The number of merchant houses in the Southern Chamber of Commerce has also decreased from more than 40 to 19. Whenever ships sail, each merchant house must coordinate and limit the allocation of goods to avoid competitive sales after arriving at the port. The Chaozhou and Shantou industries and businesses have suffered a major blow as a result. For example, in the case of silver ingots, workers who used to make tin foil and tin paper have moved to Annam to produce them themselves in order to avoid heavy taxes. Workers who make soy sauce, pickles, bamboo products, and porcelain have also gone there to manufacture and sell them, so they do not need to be shipped from Shantou. Tea, cloth, silk, shoes, and paper have mostly been seized by Japanese goods. Soybean oil, soybeans, bean cakes, and peanuts are transported by Japanese ships from northern China for dumping. Therefore, most of the business of the Southern Chamber of Commerce has been plundered by Japanese-organized companies. Chaozhou and Shantou merchants are happy to know that the Sino-French Vietnamese trade treaty is progressing smoothly and was signed in Paris on May 4. The annexes to the treaty have also been approved by the French Chamber of Deputies and have now been submitted to the Senate. It is expected to be implemented soon. It is reported that the contents of the treaty are generally based on the reciprocal tariff rates agreed upon by both sides in 1910. As for the goods shipped from Haiphong to South China, which were originally taxed at 25 percent, the rate has been changed to 1 percent. The head tax on overseas Chinese is reduced from six yuan per person per year to three yuan. The establishment of consulates in Saigon, Hanoi, and Haiphong is also permitted. At the same time, the original tariff of 2 yuan per ton of Hongji coal shipped from Haiphong to Shantou has been reduced to 9 jiao and a half, or 8 jiao in one account. In addition, the import tariff on Vietnamese rice, which was originally 1 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen per 100 jin for foreign rice, has been changed to 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen. The completion of this treaty may be a new turning point for Sino-Vietnamese trade. The various merchant houses of the Shantou Southern Chamber of Commerce that were previously suspended are now preparing to resume business after the treaty is established, and are also adding chartered ships to operate the routes to Saigon and Haiphong. The market prices of hemp ropes, garlic, vegetables, fish fry, porcelain, and various other goods seem to be gradually becoming active again.</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jinan branch of the International Savings Society received an order from the Qingdao head office last night (the 2nd) and posted a notice this morning (the 3rd) at 9:00 AM, announcing its closure. The manager of the branch, Qi Jinbiao, has now gone to Qingdao to ask for instructions. The depositors of the society in Jinan were shocked to hear the news. At about 8:00 AM this morning, many people flocked to the gate of the society, and by about 12:00 PM, there were even more onlookers. However, after staying for a while, they left in disappointment because there was nothing much they could do. The branch was established more than ten years ago, and the friendly societies under its jurisdiction include Jining, Linqing, Weixian, Tengxian, Qixian, and Jiaoxian, as well as the agencies in various counties. There are more than 100,000 depositors, with a monthly income of about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The total amount of savings in Shandong Province over the years is no less than 30 million yuan. Now that the branch has closed, it is of great concern to the depositors in the city. Moreover, the society's notice did not mention how to deal with the problem in the future. However, it is rumored that the society has reached an agreement with the Jinan Sino-French Savings Society to transfer savings, that is, all those who have a society's membership card, regardless of the number of years they have deposited, can use the membership card to deposit with the Sino-French Savings Society as collateral, and continue to save in the society, with a fixed term of fourteen years and a monthly membership fee of 2 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen. The Jinan Sino-French Savings Society is located west of the YMCA on Erda Malu. The society also has branches in Jining, Linqing, Weixian, Zhoucun, and Dezhou, with a total of more than 26,600 depositors and a monthly income of more than 80,000 yuan. It is not known whether the depositors will agree to this transfer method. (3rd)</p>

<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government has not yet determined the funds for highway construction in the province. Over the years, in addition to the funds borrowed from the National Economic Council and the funds allocated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Commission, most of the funds have been borrowed temporarily. This year, the debt has accumulated too much and cannot be borrowed again, so the highways in Shucheng and Liu'an, etc., either need to be improved, completed, or repaired, but there is no money to pay for them. However, the roads are very important for military transportation and general transportation, and cannot be delayed. Moreover, the provincial treasury income has been budgeted and designated for specific purposes, so it is impossible to divert the funds. After the disaster, it is impossible to increase taxes, which would increase the burden on the people. Therefore, it is necessary to find a way to save the situation when there is no other way to do so. Therefore, it is planned to continue to issue highway bonds to meet the urgent needs. The provincial government has submitted the situation of the bond issuance, the bond issuance regulations, and the principal and interest repayment schedule to the Military Affairs Committee for approval. The instructions have now been received, and approval has been granted. The instructions have been forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review in accordance with the law. The matters to be recorded on the face of the bond are as follows: (1) Total amount: 800,000 yuan in national currency; (2) Collateral: 10% of the road construction surcharge in the province and half of the provincial revenue; (3) Fund management agency: Anhui Province Republic of China 24th Year Highway Bond Fund Management Committee; (4) Principal and interest repayment agency: banks and county governments in the province; (5) Principal and interest repayment period: from December 1935 to June 1936, interest is paid twice, and principal and interest are repaid from December 1936 to June 1944; (6) Interest rate: 8% per annum, with 20,000 bonds of 5 yuan and 10 yuan each and 5,000 bonds of 100 yuan each.

<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government, based on the first provincial administrative conference and a proposal from the Department of Construction regarding various counties utilizing local raw material production to establish factories and benefit people's livelihood, resolved that counties with sufficient construction funds should follow the methods for people's livelihood factories and handle the matter accordingly. Those unable to organize factories should promote, guide, and improve existing famous industrial products locally and promote them externally. Furthermore, proposals from the magistrates of Fengtai and Qimen counties to establish factories were also resolved to be handled together. This matter is urgently needed to be implemented. Therefore, nine articles for implementing this resolution are specifically formulated, communicated to various counties to investigate and assess the actual situation, strictly ordering responsible personnel to actively handle matters and report back.

<h3 id="e103">Jiangsu Province Develops Salt Reclamation: Reclamation Design Committee Plans Divided into Three Major Areas, Requiring Over 20 Million in Funding, Implemented in Phases <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The coastal tidal flats east of the Jiangbei Chuan Chang River in Jiangsu Province, spanning the jurisdictions of Fuyuan, Yancheng, Xingdong, Rudong, and other counties, have gradually expanded in recent years due to the eastward shift of the sea, with reclaimable land exceeding ten million mu. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, abolished salt fields seeking reclamation have emerged in coastal areas, and industrialists have successively organized companies to engage in cultivation. Unfortunately, they have acted independently without overall planning, and droughts and floods have not been thoroughly resolved, resulting in very little success. The Jiangsu Provincial authorities, aware of this situation, organized the Reclamation Area Design Committee last year to actively prepare a plan to develop the salt reclamation area. The two directors, Zhao and Shen, the director of the Land Bureau, Zhu, and reclamation design committee member Li Jixin, among others, personally inspected the reclamation areas in various coastal counties in the spring. They all felt that it was regrettable to leave such vast wasteland uncultivated. If it were reorganized, new waterways opened to facilitate irrigation, and highways built to facilitate transportation, then tens of millions of mu of wasteland could be transformed into cultivated land within a few years, which would be of great benefit to the rural economy of Jiangsu Province. After the commissioners returned to the province from the survey, they immediately began drafting a plan to develop the salt reclamation area. After two months of meticulous design, the draft plan has now been completely prepared and was read and passed at a recent meeting of the Design Committee and submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for discussion. It is reported that the main points of the draft plan are roughly divided into a water conservancy plan, a plan to reorganize existing cultivation companies, and a plan to establish large-scale cultivation companies. The first step is to open new canals and nearby rivers and ports to connect north and south for regulation. Then, the excavated soil will be used to build a large sea dike on the east bank to prevent salinity and build north-south avenues on the west bank to facilitate land transportation. To the west of the new canal, ditches will be dredged, connecting to the Chuan Chang River to receive water sources, so seawater will not reach it and siltation will be reduced. To the east of the new canal, diversion rivers will be opened to connect to ports to facilitate official drainage, which will be easy since the sea is nearby. Simple sluice gates will be built at appropriate locations to allow for flexible control, so that drainage and irrigation are both considered, and droughts and floods can be prepared for. The second step is to reorganize existing cultivation companies. Those that have been successful will be subsidized by the government for their development. Those unable to continue operating will be taken back by the government at a reserve price for self-management. On the other hand, the government will establish a large-scale model cultivation company to engage in development and operation. The scope of the reclamation area is planned to extend from the Jiaoxie Town of Dongchatai in the south to the Chenjiagang of Lianshui in the north, all located west of the new canal and east of the Chuan Chang River, spanning approximately 300 kilometers north-south and 30 kilometers east-west, covering an area of over 8,060 square kilometers, equivalent to over 13 million mu. To take into account the current economic strength and ensure its feasible realization, it has been decided to proceed in phases. It is planned to divide the area with the Xin Yang Gang as the boundary, with the area north of Jiaoxie and south of Xin Yang Gang designated as the first-phase project area, and the area north of Xin Yang Gang and south of Chenjiagang designated as the second-phase project area. The total cost of the above projects and reclamation expenses is estimated to require approximately over 20 million yuan. However, in recent years, government and local finances have both felt extremely depressed. Such a large sum of money is difficult to raise in the short term. In the future, it will be implemented in phases. Regarding the funds for opening new canals, a portion has already been designated from the water conservancy construction bonds issued last year. Therefore, surveying will begin after the start of the new year. Earthwork will still be carried out using the requisitioned labor system, which can reduce labor costs. However, the Xin Yang Gang area is currently sparsely populated, and it is feared that it may not be possible to carry it out. Regarding the issue of immigrants and cultivation in the area of diverting the Huai River into the sea and straightening the bay, the Huai River Diversion Engineering Office previously sent a letter to the Reclamation Design Committee requesting that engineer Zhang Binchen be sent to survey the land. He has now surveyed over 20,000 mu of wasteland in the Qitao area at the mouth of the Huai River into the sea. The area is entirely clay soil, which is very suitable for planting. The cost of opening irrigation canals and ponds is approximately over 200,000 yuan, which will be allocated from the Huai River preparation funds. However, according to relevant sources, most of the civilian land requisitioned for straightening the bay is owned by self-cultivating farmers with several to over ten mu of land. They do not want to go to distant places to cultivate because the loss is not significant. It is reported that the authorities plan to welcome those who wish to go, and those who do not wish to go will be given a small land price to allow them to make a living on their own.</p>

<p>The county government received a report yesterday from the residents of Xiaokunshan Township, stating that there were seven Jiangbei boats with suspicious behavior, requesting an investigation. County Magistrate Jin, believing that there had been kidnapping cases in that area, dispatched a squad from the 12th Security Brigade, the water patrol team, and the special task force to investigate. They departed at 2:00 PM. Upon arrival, they interrogated the crew of the seven Jiangbei boats, who stated that they had been hired by a foreman to come to Songjiang for work. A search revealed no prohibited items. They were ordered to send two representatives to Songjiang with the foreman's verification for further processing. While the team was returning to Songjiang, they noticed two pedestrians prostrate on the riverbank near the 30th Foreign Bridge, pretending to wash their hands, acting suspiciously. They approached to investigate, and the pedestrians immediately swam away. They were quickly apprehended, and a six-inch handgun with eight bullets was seized. They confessed their names as Yang A'san, from Pudong, Shanghai, and Zhang A'shui, a local from Punan County, both employed as plasterers. They stated that they had been contacted by someone to take a car to Songjiang, walk to Fengxian, and plan a kidnapping. They have already been taken back to the brigade headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Telegraph Department of the Ministry of Communications, upon receiving a report that Li Xinquan's dental office and other places in the first district of this county were privately installing wireless generators, secretly ordered engineer Wang Zhengwei and Chen Yingqiu of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to arrive in Songjiang on the morning of the 6th. They, together with the Public Security Bureau, went to Li Xinquan's dental office to search, but did not find a transmitter, only a receiver. Therefore, they took dentist Li Xinquan to the Public Security Bureau. They also searched Yang Desheng's store, which also sold wireless equipment, and found a small 2-ampere transceiver in a dusty paper package that had been sealed for many years in the east attic. The store owner claimed that the machine had been discarded for many years and had no light bulbs, as evidenced by the dust. Therefore, the store clerk and the machine were taken to the bureau and released on bail, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Wang Weinong, a 23-year-old accountant from Shaoxing at the Baxianqiao branch of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, fled to Suzhou after a failed speculation, hiding at No. 46 Guanjin Lane, Taohuawu. Detectives from the Shanghai Police Department came to Suzhou on the 30th of last month and, together with the Public Security Bureau, went to arrest him, only to find that the place was a family nunnery of Zhou Dongshan, with only the words "Dongshan" engraved above the Shikumen gate and a door light installed. Inside was a small courtyard, with a Buddhist hall in the middle, a kitchen in the east wing, and not many houses, exquisitely furnished, with famous calligraphy and paintings hanging. On both sides were bedrooms, with the doors locked. Through the windows, they could see that the tables and chairs were all made of mahogany. Only a monk named Ke Guan and an old incense ash keeper over sixty years old came out, admitting that Wang was hiding in the nunnery but had gone out and whether he would return was unknown. They were ordered to report to the bureau for arrest as soon as Wang came. Afterwards, plainclothes detectives were sent to patrol near the nunnery. On the following day (July 1st), Inspector Hong went to inquire again, only to find that the monk in the nunnery was also missing. According to the incense ash keeper, Ke Guan was from Shuangqiao, Wangting, and was ordained at Pudu Temple. This time, he had returned to Shuangqiao. On the 5th, it was learned that Wang was hiding in the home of Pan Chenqing at No. 14 Wangjiafen. They rushed to ambush him and found Wang hiding in a pile of straw in the attic of Pan's house. They took him to the bureau and found 316 silver dollars, a watch, thirteen lottery tickets, a fountain pen, and a rattan basket on Wang's person, all of which were taken to the station. However, a strange turn of events occurred. At the same time, the incense ash keeper of the Zhou Dongshan family nunnery in Taohuawu was suddenly killed in the kitchen of the east wing of the nunnery. According to Inspector Hong Shiqin, who reported to the bureau, at 5:30 AM on the 5th, Constable He Naikang was patrolling the nunnery when he saw the nunnery gate ajar. He went inside to inspect and found no one. The ash keeper was lying in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor. The Public Security Bureau reported to the local court, which sent prosecutor Yang An to supervise the inspection. The deceased was found lying on his back, with his arms tightly against his chest, his hair graying, his eyes open, and his mouth open. There were three knife cuts on his neck, the back of his neck completely severed, over two inches deep, and the neck bone not broken. The neck circumference was about one foot, and the knife cut was over two-thirds, about seven inches. A kitchen knife was left next to his left shoulder. It was determined that he was killed while alive, and the murderer was at least two people. Judging from the situation, it seemed that one person had pushed him to the ground, his body lying on his back, and then moved and turned over after the event. The blood did not flow downwards, so it was determined that he was killed lying down, not committing suicide while standing. Prosecutor Yang immediately gathered the four neighbors for questioning. According to them, the ash keeper had recently sighed, "I have no life to live," and the neighbors had comforted him, saying, "The detectives are investigating fugitives, what does it have to do with you?" They had still seen him talking to people at 7:00 PM on the 5th. However, at 1:00 AM on the 4th, they had heard a loud banging on the gate. Prosecutor Yang believed that the circumstances were too bizarre, and since he had still been talking to people at 7:00 AM, how could Constable He Naikang of the 5th Precinct have discovered the body at 5:30 AM? Therefore, he went to the Public Security Bureau for investigation on the 6th. After returning to the court, he summoned He Naikang to court for investigation. This bizarre murder case is still under close investigation.</p>

<p>Fuqiao Town, located in the county and situated on the banks of the Yangtze River, is important for transportation. The third squad of the security team is stationed there to supplement the police force of the Public Security Bureau. On the afternoon of the 4th, squad member Xu Yueshen went to Yan A'si's fruit store to buy vegetables to take back to the squad headquarters. He lost several roots on the way, claiming that the quantity was insufficient. Without asking why, he returned to the original store to argue, and beat Yan A'si. He returned to the squad, still feeling unsatisfied. He tore up his symbol and vaguely reported to squad leader Wang Shaofang. Squad leader Wang did not investigate deeply, and angrily ordered squad member Fan Wen to arrest Yan A'si for punishment. The merchants and residents of the entire town were greatly angered upon hearing this and went on strike to protest. They sent telegrams to the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Office and the Taicang County Government, requesting impartial handling and demanding severe punishment for the illegal squad member. District Chief Qian Hanping, fearing that the disturbance would escalate, bailed out Yan and telegraphed the county government urgently. County Magistrate Wen, upon receiving the telegram, immediately sent first clerk Yu Mou, aboard the Zhenyang warship, to mediate overnight. The merchants and residents put forward the following demands: punish the offending soldiers, give Wang, the squad leader, a reasonable punishment for his lax discipline, and transfer the team due to its poor discipline. Clerk Yu agreed to forward the requests separately. The merchants and residents of the city were satisfied, and all resumed business on the 5th.</p>

<p>The Jiufeng Jute Bag Shop in Wuyi Market, Changzhou, is opened by Chen Yixing from Fenghua. In November of last year, Ding A'hai, a 30-year-old man from Shaoxing, drifted to Changzhou and could not find a way to make a living. He was introduced to Jiufeng to work as a temporary helper. However, his income was limited and insufficient to cover expenses. The shop owner, Chen Yixing, had revealed his intention to dismiss him due to poor business. Recently, the female owner had been even more critical, often pointing out his faults. Ding A'hai, being naturally clumsy, felt that life was meaningless. At around 9:00 PM on the 4th, he conceived the idea of suicide. He went upstairs and untied his belt to hang himself. His colleagues in the shop were shocked to discover him and rushed upstairs to rescue him. Ding's face was ashen and his breath was weak. It took a long time for him to recover. That night, he was taken to the Zhaoshang Inn by his colleagues, who persuaded him at all times. On the afternoon of the 5th, the shop owner gave him money to send him back to his hometown.</p>

<p>There are already 48 counties that have established treasuries, including Zhenjiang. There are still 12 counties that have not been established. The current Department of Finance plans to fully establish them within this year. Several counties, such as Chongming and Chuansha, will implement it within the month. Furthermore, the department believes that county local revenues and expenditures and accounting directors should have records for review at any time. The authority of the accounting directors is currently limited to the management of county government revenues and expenditures, and the revenues and expenditures of other local agencies cannot be taken into account. In order to expand their scope of authority and implement accounting systems, five counties, including Wuxi, Changshu, Shanghai, Nantong, and Rudong, will be tried first. If successful, it will be promoted to other counties. The relevant compilation booklets have been drafted and will be issued to the relevant counties after further review.</p>

<p>Madam Zhu Bihua, the wife of famous lawyer Han Guohua in the city, hired a rickshaw driven by Chen Shierzai on the morning of the 5th to go to Qingtai Fuluhuo to buy groceries at Yuanmenqiao. After getting out of the car, the car was parked outside the door. Luo Zhiyuan, the police officer on duty at the time, noticed this and stepped forward to interfere. Chen explained that the owner was shopping and would leave soon, and politely discussed with the police officer. However, the police officer refused and untied the leather belt around his waist and hit the rickshaw driver head-on. Seeing this, the merchants and residents there believed that if the rickshaw driver had indeed violated the police regulations, he could be taken to the police station for handling, but he should not be beaten without reason. They argued with the police officer, who then blew his whistle and gathered many neighboring police officers to beat Chen, causing Chen Xiaoer's mouth and both arms to be injured, especially the lower part of the body, which was the most severely injured. He immediately fell to the ground. After the police caused the incident, they falsely reported it to the Public Security Bureau by phone and ordered the rickshaw driver to be taken to the police station for handling. The merchants and residents were furious upon hearing this and gathered three or four hundred people to escort the violent police officer Luo Zhiyuan and the injured rickshaw driver to the county government for investigation. At the same time, lawyer Han Guohua and patrol officer He Yayi of the fourth precinct rushed to the scene after hearing the news. County Magistrate Ma Zhenbang was accompanying the provincial committee to the second district to check the Baojia, so Secretary Wang came out to meet them. After both sides reported the situation, Secretary Wang instructed patrol officer He to take charge of the violent police officer Luo Zhiyuan and inspect the injured rickshaw driver Chen Xiaoerzi. He then instructed lawyer Han to take him for a medical examination first, and Secretary Wang also persuaded the hundreds of dissatisfied people to disperse. Lawyer Han immediately took the rickshaw driver to the court to verify the injuries and then sent him to the hospital for treatment. The patrol officer immediately sent the violent police officer to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. It is now reported that Chen's family has filed a complaint with the court.</p>

Regarding the request to increase import tariffs on paper plates, the original request has been copied and forwarded, instructing the National Tariff Commission to consider it. As for domestic transit duties, the Ministry has already submitted a request for their abolition, which will be implemented on a fixed date." However, to this day, we only see the announcement of the continuation of the 5% surcharge on customs duties for another year, while there is no news regarding the abolition of transit duties. At a time when national industry and commerce are on the verge of collapse, how can this lip service without substance provide relief? Furthermore, the Industrial and Commercial Relief Loan Association has been established for many days, and the 20 million guarantee treasury bonds have already been allocated. Why has it not yet been implemented? At a time when industry and commerce are in urgent need of relief, it is like a severe drought hoping for rain clouds. If there is further delay, we fear that there will be a complete collapse, and it will be impossible to save the situation. Looking ahead, we cannot help but tremble with fear. Your association leads the business community and is admired by the masses. Recently, your proposals for revitalizing industry and commerce,统制trade, and managing foreign exchange are truly fundamental and urgent remedies. However, while we hope that long-term plans will be implemented, we also hope that you will urge the government to immediately realize the two urgent matters of abolishing transit duties and providing industrial and commercial loans. If there is continued delay, with the intention of perfunctorily dealing with the situation, we fear that the danger that comes cannot be predicted. Please send a telegram to the authorities to implement it quickly. We await your response with the utmost anticipation." On the same day, we also received a letter from the United Association of Chinese Paper Mills with the same request. We believe that the abolition of transit duties and the provision of industrial and commercial relief loans are intended to facilitate the sale of goods and the turnover of funds. After the extreme panic in Shanghai last year, we rely on this as a good remedy for recovery. The government's sacrifice of tax revenue and resolute action in this regard is particularly appreciated by the people. The association has repeatedly received instructions from the Ministry of Finance stating that the abolition of transit duties will be implemented soon, and newspaper reports have repeatedly stated that an order would be issued on July 1st. The Ministry of Finance has not denied this. However, the deadline has passed, and the order is silent. The only thing that has materialized is the extension of the customs surcharge for another year. In contrast, merchants cannot help but feel disappointed. The industrial and commercial loans have been ordered for a long time, and the treasury bonds have been allocated, but the funds have not yet been implemented. Looking back at the situation in the business community, we barely made it through the end of the year, and half a year has already passed. The desperate situation of being stretched thin has been reported in newspapers and spread throughout society. Being close to both Beijing and Shanghai, we believe that the authorities are aware of this. If there is further delay, the crisis will inevitably deepen. It is the duty of the association to report this to you. The two matters requested by the United Association are the common desire of all industries. We beseech you to approve and implement them immediately, so as to save the situation from imminent danger. We would be extremely grateful. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce humbly requests.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to approve application forms, etc. Implementation of the loan will commence upon approval of the loan outline by ministerial order. The China Goods Alliance held a meeting yesterday to request relief. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Loan Association Meeting to Discuss Forms: The Fourth Committee Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee resolved to hand over the following forms to the Central Bank of China, China Communications Bank, China Goods Bank, and the United Reserve of Money Shops for research: (1) Industrial and Commercial Loan Application Form; (2) Certificate for Treasury Bonds as Second Collateral for Loans; (3) Loan Withdrawal Slip for Discounting at Banks. The research has been completed yesterday. It is reported that the association has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow to propose approval. It has been decided that after the loan outline, etc., have been approved by the Ministry of Finance, official business will commence at the China Goods Bank office on the second floor of Henan Road. At the same time, loans will begin. The loan forms will be forwarded to China Goods factories by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for completion. The office has not been formally opened in recent days.</p>
<p>China Goods Alliance Meeting for Relief: The China Goods Alliance Committee, jointly organized by various China Goods organizations, held its 49th Standing Committee meeting at its headquarters on Hankou Road yesterday afternoon. Wang Xingyi presided over the meeting and reported on the progress of the China Goods factories requesting relief. The discussion then commenced, and it was resolved that a general table of loan applications from the first batch of members, together with the original survey forms, should be sent to the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee for preliminary registration. Balance sheets and property inventories will be submitted later. The meeting adjourned at around 4 p.m. According to investigations by a reporter from New Voice News Agency, the first batch of China Goods factories and shops applying for loans numbered more than 60, with a total amount of approximately 6 million yuan in national currency. Furthermore, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will forward all applications for loans from China Goods industries and businesses to the Loan Review Committee for processing.</p>

<p>According to China East News Agency, the flights of China National Aviation Corporation have been obstructed by the weather for several days. It is learned that the company's northbound aircraft on the Guangdong route, after arriving in Wenzhou the day before yesterday, was temporarily detained due to bad weather. It once flew from Wenzhou to Shanghai yesterday morning, but returned due to fog in Hangzhou Bay. The southbound aircraft on the same route, which departed from Longhua yesterday morning, also flew back due to weather conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Eurasia Aviation Corporation: New Aircraft Flew to Beiping Yesterday Morning; More Recent Developments Expected from Next Year <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, a new Junkers-type giant aircraft ordered by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation from the German Lufthansa Airlines was shipped to China by the German ship "Neuenfels" on the 25th of last month. After being unloaded and assembled at the Longhua Aircraft Factory, it underwent a test flight on the 3rd of this month with excellent results. It flew to Beiping for the first time yesterday morning at 8 a.m. Whether it will be added to the Beiping-Guangdong or Shanghai-Xinjiang route is uncertain, as although the company's schedule is fixed, all aircraft are not designated to a specific route and can be dispatched and used at any time. According to Secretary Cha of the company, the company's business has been developing quite well recently. It has decided to increase the number of flights starting next month to expand its aviation business. As for the matter of increasing its capital to 7.5 million yuan, it has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications for record. The reason for the increase in capital is that this year's budget is seriously insufficient. Therefore, the board of directors decided to submit the matter to the shareholders' meeting for review, and the principle has already been approved. It is expected that the company's business will have newer developments and expansion starting next year.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Public Works Bureau Director Xu and Tan: Municipal Public Works Construction <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>On June 28th, the Shanghai Municipal Council resolved several cases, including three related to public works construction: universal supply of water and electricity, relocation of the South Shanghai garbage and night soil wharves, and plans for the supply of gas. Director Xu stated to visitors yesterday that the council's resolutions demonstrate the council members' deep concern for municipal public works construction, and that the proposals are extremely concise, which is deeply admirable. Regarding the</p>
<p>Universal Supply of Water and Electricity Case: The bureau's administrative policy for water and electricity is universal supply, which has been gradually promoted in recent years with considerable success. There are two companies supplying tap water in the city, namely the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company and the Inland Tap Water Company, each with its own operating area. Two years ago, the Public Works Bureau, seeing that there were still many places within the city that were not within the operating areas of the two companies, established a municipal water supply office to plan for supply. Currently, the Public Works Bureau's water supply office is already supplying water in Xujiahui and other places. As for the places in the city that currently do not have tap water supply, the more important ones are the districts of Pudong and Zhaozhen, Wusong, etc. In Pudong, before the January 28th Incident, the Public Works Bureau had already planned to build its own water plant, and the drawings and site had been selected and purchased. Due to the national crisis, it was temporarily suspended. Last year, it was actively promoted again, and it was scheduled to start supplying water in April of this year. However, Mayor Wu decided to hand it over to the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company to undertake, and the company is currently building the water plant. Wusong has now been assigned to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company for operation, and the water pipes have been connected to Wusong Town. As for Zhaozhen, the Public Works Bureau has ordered the Zhabei Company to plan for tap water supply, and it is expected that there will be a solution soon. Regarding electricity supply, it is now quite widespread in terms of quantity. In terms of quality, there is still a large difference between the generating capacity and the power supply of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The Public Works Bureau has ordered the company to plan to purchase additional generators to increase supply. Regarding the,</p>
<p>Relocation of the South Shanghai Garbage and Night Soil Wharves Case: There are two night soil wharves and one garbage wharf in the South Shanghai wharf area. These wharves are used to dump garbage and feces into ships, which is very important for general hygiene. However, the area is now a busy port area. In order to improve the city's appearance, facilitate transportation, and promote the prosperity of the market, it should be relocated. In 1929, during the Port Authority era, there was a meeting to relocate the night soil wharf, and it was decided that it should be relocated to another location when necessary. In 1931, the Public Works Bureau wrote to the Health Bureau to find a way to relocate it. In 1932, the Public Works Bureau presented a request to the municipal government for relocation. However, the two problems of the relocation site and the cost of rebuilding the wharf could not be resolved, so it has not been implemented for a long time. Even this year, the Public Works Bureau was ordered to convene a meeting and decided to move the garbage wharf to near the Dunyi Wharf south of Dongdu. The case has been established, and construction can begin as soon as the Health and Public Works Bureaus obtain the construction funds. Now that the council has passed the resolution to relocate the South Shanghai night soil and garbage wharves, the Public Works Bureau hopes that it can be implemented as soon as possible. Regarding the,</p>
<p>Gas Supply Case: There is indeed a need for gas supply in the city. Before the establishment of the municipal government, the Shanghai Gas Company supplied gas across borders in Zhabei and West Shanghai. After the establishment of the Public Works Bureau, in order to respect sovereignty, it negotiated with the company. Finally, the company expressed its willingness to pay annual business tax, land use fees, and a deposit to the city, and to comply with the city's road digging regulations for laying pipelines. Therefore, in January 1930, a contract was signed with the company to supervise it. Since the signing of the contract, the number of gas users in various places has been increasing. Recently, there has been a great need for gas supply in South Shanghai. In the Public Works Bureau's opinion, if a national citizen is willing to invest in establishing a gas plant, the municipal government should provide assistance. Therefore, it was stipulated in the contract allowing the Shanghai Gas Company to supply gas in the city that when a gas plant is established in the city, the company's business rights in the city should be terminated immediately. However, the municipal treasury has been extremely strained in recent years and has been unable to host it. Moreover, industry and commerce are extremely depressed, so no one has invested. Therefore, it is difficult to host it officially or commercially, which is well known to all citizens.</p>

The committee members modified the wording, and it was resolved to pass the revised text and submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry for record. It will be published after approval. Other cases were also discussed before the meeting adjourned at around 5 p.m.</p>

Resolution: Passed. (3) Date of the Sixth Standing Committee Meeting: It was decided to hold it at 4 p.m. on the 13th of this month.

<p>According to Central News Agency, Yang Hu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, suffered a severe stomach illness a month ago and found it difficult to balance union affairs. He repeatedly telegraphed the central government, earnestly resigning from the position of Chairman. The central government repeatedly telegraphed back, expressing condolences and sending personnel to Shanghai to express their concern. Yang declined to be high-handed. The reporter visited Yang at his private residence yesterday and asked for his opinion. He was received. Yang was still lying in bed. According to him, "I was entrusted by the central government to prepare for the sound organization of the Chinese Seamen's Union, improve the lives of seamen, and develop China's shipping industry. This was originally my personal ambition, so I resolutely took on the responsibility. Fortunately, in the past two years, the union's cause has made some progress. I originally hoped to complete the matter and put the maritime transport industry on the right track. Unexpectedly, since the spring, my stomach illness has recurred from time to time, and it has become more severe a month ago. I have been bedridden for more than ten days. I feel that it is difficult to handle the burden, and I am afraid that it will affect union affairs. Therefore, I repeatedly begged the central government to approve my resignation as Chairman. The central government repeatedly expressed condolences and sent personnel to express concern about my illness. Personally, I am grateful for the central government's kindness. However, based on the facts, it is difficult to balance the situation. However, union affairs cannot be interrupted even for a day. Therefore, while I still earnestly requested the central government to approve my resignation, I invited Ma Bolin, Wang Yongsheng, and Liu Jingcao, original members of the union's preparatory committee, to jointly maintain union affairs temporarily. Committee members Ma, Wang, and Liu have a long history in the seamen's movement and will be able to uphold the central government's policies and handle matters with ease. With someone in charge of the union's affairs, I am comforted. Afterwards, whether I am in office or not, I will still uphold my ambition and, in my personal and central government position, be concerned about the lives of hundreds of thousands of Chinese seamen." Yang's condition has been improving, and he is expected to recover soon. Cuixiu Hall is currently being renovated and will be opened at the end of the month.</p>

<p>According to New Voice News Agency, the state-run China Merchants Bureau is the agent for the Huashang Steamship Company's Haiyi new vessel, which will travel on the Shanghai-Haiphong scheduled route. The vessel has arrived in Shanghai from France and is being renovated at the Ruirong Shipyard. The work is nearing completion, and the inaugural voyage to Qingdao is scheduled for the 20th. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>French Vessel Purchased and Renamed Haiyi: The Huashang Steamship Company's vessels Haihua, 3,301 tons, and Haihua, 2,103 tons, were previously rented to the state-run China Merchants Bureau to travel on the Shanghai-Guangdong and Shanghai-Haikou routes. Now, a giant vessel has been purchased from the French Atlantic Shipping Company, originally named Caraibe, and renamed Haiyi. It arrived in Shanghai from France on the 9th of last month and was immediately taken to the Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu for renovation. The vessel has a cargo tonnage of 4,496, a registered gross tonnage of 2,976, and a net tonnage of 1,188.</p>
<p>Renovation Nearing Completion; Reception Planned for Visits: Haiyi is 331 feet and 8 inches long, 43 feet and 2 inches wide, and 24 feet and 9 inches deep, with a draft of 20 feet and 2 inches. It has a speed of 10.5 to 11.5 knots per hour, was built in the United Kingdom in 1908, has 2,000 horsepower, and has a machine speed of 85 revolutions per minute. After renovation, it will have 18 first-class cabins, each for two people, 10 second-class cabins, each for four to six people, and 120 second-class seats, for a total capacity of about 200 passengers. The renovation is scheduled to be completed by the 10th of this month, and receptions are planned for the 13th and 14th of this month to invite people from all walks of life in Shanghai to visit the vessel.</p>
<p>China Merchants Agents Open New Route: After receiving the order from the Ministry of Communications, the state-run China Merchants Bureau had planned to open overseas routes, but it could not be realized due to economic limitations. Previously, it was planned to have the Puan vessel travel on the Shanghai-Manila route, but it was suspended due to uncertainty about operations. After the Huashang Steamship Company purchased the Haiyi vessel, Manager Ye Chuanfang and China Merchants Bureau General Manager Liu Hongsheng discussed the agency issue. An agreement was roughly reached, and the vessel was entrusted to the China Merchants Bureau as an agent to travel on the Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Beihai-Haikou-Haiphong (French Indochina) route.</p>
<p>Contract Negotiated; Implementation in August: The contract for the China Merchants Bureau to act as agent for the Haiyi vessel, as well as the passenger ticket prices and sailing times for the Shanghai-Beihai-Haikou-Haiphong route, are being negotiated. The contract is about to be signed. It is reported that the ticket prices for Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou will be one grade lower than those of the Yuanheng Lizhen vessels. In the future, when it starts sailing, it will be a scheduled liner, focusing on loading cargo and carrying passengers. As for the official date of sailing, it will be around the beginning of August.</p>
<h3 id="e137">First Announcement from the Office for Preventing Cholera Epidemics <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Temporary Office for Preventing Cholera Epidemics Announcement No. 1: (1) When this office issued its first announcement on July 12th last year, Shanghai was in the midst of a heat wave with temperatures reaching 104.4 degrees, compared to only about 80 degrees this year, resembling early autumn. However, unlike last year, there have been no cholera outbreaks in this city or across the country so far. Only in Suzhou, Ningbo, and Guangzhou, etc., have there been multiple cases of suspected cholera-related gastrointestinal illnesses since mid-June. (2) In the past few years, such as in 1925, 1926, 1929, and 1932, cholera outbreaks sometimes reached over 4,000 cases. The rainfall in those years was very low, with rainfall from November to April of the following year being 832, 884, 779, and 986, respectively. These figures are very low, as the average for the past 25 years is 1463. This year's rainfall has been abundant, with 1402 from November of last year to April of this year, so a severe epidemic is unlikely. Last year's rainfall was 1184, and there was almost no cholera outbreak. (3) Research on Vibrio cholerae in the rivers and marshes near Shanghai is ongoing. Recently, more Vibrio cholerae-like bacteria have been found, but no attempts have been made to draw any conclusions. (4) The first meeting of this office was held on April 8th at the Shanghai Municipal Government, chaired by Director Liu Ruiheng. Attendees were key health personnel from Beijing and Shanghai. Since then, the epidemic prevention and publicity groups have each held three subcommittee meetings, which have greatly advanced the work of preventing cholera. (5) Regarding the research on cholera diagnostic serum, a special group has been designated. This group suggests that since the various chemical examination laboratories in Shanghai are using different sera and methods, it would be best for each to proceed separately, so that comparisons can be made to arrive at a definitive conclusion. (6) In order to study the earliest cases of cholera, an agreement has been made with the Central Health Experimental Bureau in Nanjing for the examination of stool samples from suspected cholera patients provided by hospitals in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. An agreement has also been made with the Lister Institute for the examination of stool samples sent by hospitals in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and southern Shanghai. The chemical examination bureaus of the Public Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Chemical Examination Laboratory will conduct examinations on stool samples obtained within their respective areas. With this distribution, it is hoped that early cases can be discovered quickly to prevent the spread of the disease. (7) Each water company, as in the past, will continue to supply free tap water to the poor from street hydrants to prevent them from drinking polluted water and contracting the infection. At the same time, well water will be inspected regularly and disinfected within possible limits. Washing food and utensils in polluted water poses a risk of infection or a cholera outbreak. (8) Other preventive measures, such as education and publicity through lectures, stickers, leaflets, films, dramas, phonographs, and radio broadcasts, have been implemented. However, these methods are secondary. The primary task should be the construction of modern waterworks in densely populated areas, as ubiquitous flies and harmful fruits are only dangerous after they occasionally contaminate their bodies or peels. (9) Anti-cholera vaccinations have been actively promoted since April 16th. Although no cholera has been found to date, people from all walks of life are enthusiastically coming forward, which is a good sign. It is hoped that the efforts of health authorities in recent years will have an effect, and that this terrible epidemic can be eradicated from this fourth largest port in the world. The number of vaccinations given in various districts of the city from April to June 30th is listed below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipality (May and June)——210,909</p>
<p>Public Concession (Same period)——84,883</p>
<p>French Concession (April 16th to June)——400,890</p>
<p>Health Department of the Two Roads Administration (April and May)——5,594</p>
<p>(10) As in previous years, the various district epidemic hospitals have opened. The following hospitals have a total of 500 to 600 beds and are ready to admit patients at any time:</p>
<p>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, Xizang Road</p>

<h3 id="e140">Four District Branches of the Second Special Municipality Joint Association Request Negotiations with the French Municipal Council for Refusal to Accept Wine Tax from Jushunyij醬園, Leading to Letter from Shanghai French Concession Taxpayers Association <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special Municipality Citizen's Joint Association of the French Concession of this city, regarding the case of Jushunyij醬園 at 187 Ximen Road, which has been suspended for several months due to refusing to increase tax, has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, it sent another letter to the Shanghai French Concession Taxpayers Association requesting continued negotiations. The original letter is recorded as follows: Dear Sirs, According to the statement from Fan Guanyu, the owner of Jushunyij醬園 at 187 Xidou Road, our shop was unreasonably forced by the French Municipal Council to increase the wine tax and cut off electricity. Previously, your association requested the Shanghai French Concession Taxpayers Association to strongly argue. Subsequently, the association requested Zhang Jixian, a Chinese director, to negotiate with the council. As a result, the original tax of two yuan and eight jiao was increased by seven jiao to three yuan and five jiao. The association sent a letter to your association informing our shop about the case. After this resolution, the Municipal Council has not come to collect the tax. We went to the council's tax office to pay the tax ourselves, but they refused to accept it. Suddenly, on June 26th, we received a summons from the court stating that we owed five months of monthly wine tax of five yuan each, and that mediation was scheduled for the morning of the 27th. I went to court on time, but the mediation failed. I believe a lawsuit will definitely be filed soon. This case has already been resolved through mediation by the Chinese director, but now the council is reneging and even suing in court, oppressing merchants to the extreme. Therefore, we specially report to your association and request that you promptly ask the original mediator, Chinese Director Zhang Jixian, to make representations to the French Municipal Council, stop the lawsuit, and maintain the original mediation agreement to help businesses in difficulty. We earnestly hope and pray for a reply. After checking, the shop has been suspended for several months due to refusing to increase the tax, and the losses suffered are already considerable. Now, according to the previous statement, the situation is likely to lead to endless lawsuits, and the future losses will be even greater. Therefore, we specially request that your association promptly forward the request to the original mediator, Chinese Director Zhang Jixian, to make representations to the French Municipal Council, stop the lawsuit, and maintain the original mediation agreement to help businesses in difficulty. We earnestly hope and pray for a reply.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate inquiries about various businesses for fellow villagers, the Lake Society in this city has established a Hometown Business Guidance Center within the society, divided into further education, employment, law, and health. Among them, further education guidance is particularly related to the course of life and has a close connection with career. If studying is not done properly, not only will individuals suffer, but society and the country will also suffer infinite losses. Therefore, solving the problem of further education must be based on the individual's inclinations and the strengths of their knowledge, and guidance must be given to their path. It cannot be done casually. However, individual situations are complex, school conditions vary, and clear references are required, which is beyond the capabilities of young students. In view of this, the Society has specially prepared a survey form by the Education Department of the Society and sent it to various secondary schools and vocational schools above in the country to be filled out. It has now been compiled. During the summer vacation when middle school students are entering higher education, any young students from the Lake area who have questions about further education can go to the Society for guidance. The Society has responsible personnel in charge, and any inquiries will be given sincere guidance to the appropriate path for reference. When necessary, effective assistance can still be provided.</p>

<p>The case of Cai Fan's accusation against Lang Zuyin and Bao Defu for instigating injury and making false accusations was summoned again for interrogation yesterday afternoon by Judge Liu of the First Special Court in the Eighth Criminal Court. Because the negotiations regarding Lang Zuyin's part have not yet yielded results, it is difficult to proceed. Bao Defu's instigation of injury has been temporarily requested to be withdrawn by the plaintiff, so only Bao's part of the false accusation was heard. Employees of Yang Renxing's land freight company were first summoned, who testified that Cai Yangqi was indeed a senior clerk in the land freight company from May 1933 to January 1934. Whether he had met with Bao during this time was unknown. Judge Liu questioned Cai Yangqi and Bao Defu and other persons, and ordered a change of date for further verification.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Benevolent Children's Association, recognizing that its affairs are becoming increasingly complex and its responsibilities increasingly heavy, has formally decided to build a clubhouse and is actively proceeding with it.

<h3 id="e147">Another Passenger Jumps into the River from the Tianci Steamer; Body Not Yet Recovered <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The *Tianci* steamer, sailing between Shanghai and Chongming, had an incident of a passenger jumping into the sea and committing suicide on the 29th of last month, as reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, the same steamer, traveling from Shanghai to Chongming, had another passenger jump into the river. When the steamer was leaving Shanghai and passing in front of the oil storage depot of the Meifu [Standard Oil] foreign firm, the passengers on board suddenly became noisy, saying that a passenger, taking advantage of everyone's inattention, had suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River and committed suicide by drowning. Several passengers witnessed the incident, but they only saw the person who fell into the river sink immediately. The crew reported to the ship owner, who immediately turned the steamer around and returned to the front of the Meifu dock, preparing to rescue the person. After the *Tianci* steamer turned around, they saw a raft and a civilian boat coming, so the crew shouted to inquire whether they had found the person who fell into the water. The civilian boat said that they had not. Passengers on the *Tianci* steamer said that the person who jumped into the river and committed suicide was about thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth shirt and yellow cloth trousers. Because it was impossible to recover the body on the spot, the ship owner reported the incident to the water police station and, at the same time, checked the steamer and found no belongings left behind. The *Tianci* steamer then proceeded to sail out of the port to Chongming as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Shortening of Pawnshop Redemption Period to be Submitted to Municipal Meeting for Discussion <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Trade Association, due to business difficulties, has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to shorten the redemption period. Because this matter concerns the interests of ordinary people, it will be submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion. More than forty pawnshops, both old and new, throughout the city have already closed down, while the pawnshop business in the concessions has experienced abnormal growth. The following are the details as investigated and reported by the *Ta Kung Pao* reporter.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Shortening Redemption Period: City Government Discusses <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The operating regulations of the pawnshop industry are all stipulated by the government. Regardless of whether the pawned items are gold, silver ornaments, or statues, the redemption period is set at eighteen months, with monthly interest at two percent. If the items are not redeemed by the end of the period, the pawnshop can sell them on its own. However, due to the economic recession in recent years, the number of items pawned by ordinary people, forced by livelihood, has increased compared to the past, and most of them are not redeemed. At this time of low prices, and with clothing styles constantly changing, items lose their value after a year. As a result, the pawnshops cannot recoup the cost and interest, and even suffer losses. Therefore, in order to maintain the business of its members, the trade association has submitted a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to shorten the redemption period from eighteen months to twelve months. After accepting these requests, the Social Affairs Bureau, because the issue affects the interests of poor people throughout the city, has instructed the relevant department to conduct a detailed review and submit it to the Municipal Council for in-depth discussion, striving to find a win-win solution that reduces losses for the pawnshop industry and does not adversely affect the poor. Then it will be announced and implemented.</p>

<p>Eighteen women from the Zhabei Charity Group's adoption home, who have reached the age for mate selection, began registering applicants on the 1st of this month, and the registration was full the next day. This information was reported in the newspapers, but there has been no follow-up on whether both sides have formed good relationships as a result of the consideration. The Datong News Agency reporter has now investigated the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Profiles of Applicants <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Among the eighteen applicants, fourteen are businessmen, two are workers, and two are self-employed. The oldest is no more than thirty years old. In terms of their monthly income, the highest is one hundred and fifteen yuan, and the lowest is fifteen yuan, with twenty yuan being the average. Among them, three are widowers. Most of them are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Simple Conversations <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>After the group began the registration process in January, it was fully booked the next day. Therefore, on the 3rd, they divided the process into morning and afternoon sessions, and the director and deputy director, Ms. Zhu and Ms. Qian, introduced the men and women to each other and held simple conversations within the home. However, at this time, both men and women were blushing, and most of the conversations were conveyed by the administrators.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Sixteen Couples Unsuccessful <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>According to the group's regulations, starting from the day of the meeting, both men and women must report the results of their consideration to the group's supervisors within three days to determine whether to accept or reject the match. Therefore, as of yesterday, the group has received all the reports from both sides. Among the eighteen assumed couples, only two couples fully agreed after consideration. The remaining sixteen couples did not have a chance.</p>
<h3 id="e154">A Page of Matchmaking Records <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The surnames and origins of the couples who have fully agreed after careful consideration by both men and women are recorded below: (1) Female: Zhu Lindi, Origin: Changzhou, Age: 18 years old; Male: Mr. Lu, Origin: Jiangsu, Occupation: Owns a cigarette shop; (2) Female: Zhu Lanhua, Origin: Hubei, Age: 19 years old; Male: Mr. Chen, Origin: Zhejiang, Occupation: Hat Shop. After investigating the situation of the men, the group submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to conclude the good relationships for the above two couples.</p>

<p>As for the remaining sixteen women in the home, whose first attempt at mate selection did not result in a successful match, it is yet to be decided whether they will be openly matched again. According to Mr. Cai Yuanfu, supervisor of the group, the decision has not yet been made. At the same time, the Fourth Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel (female) to the foster home on the afternoon before yesterday to individually consult the women in the home who participated in the mate selection. They finished the consultation at about 4 p.m. and returned to the bureau to report.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Fire Breaks Out at Jinliyuan Wharf's Number 15 Warehouse Due to Carelessness; Cause of Fire Unknown, Losses Exceed 20,000 Gold; Over Ten Types of Stored Goods Were Insured Against Fire <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 6:00 PM last night, a sudden fire broke out at Warehouse Number 15 of the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Bund in the French Concession, destroying a large quantity of goods. The total losses are estimated to be over 20,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e157">Dense Smoke Leaks <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>At 6:15 PM last night, Patrolman Number 22 of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Bund in the French Concession suddenly noticed dense smoke leaking from the cracks in the windows of Warehouse Number 15 (old Number 11) nearby. Realizing that something was wrong, he immediately blew his whistle and ran to the station to report, which was then relayed to the French Concession Fire Brigade.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Beyond Salvation <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, the company dispatched several officers to set up a perimeter. However, just five minutes later, at 6:20 PM, the fire had already broken through the roof and was beyond salvation. The fire engines from various fire brigades arrived one after another and connected to water to fight the fire. However, because the fire was smoldering, it was difficult to pour water into the building. They tried to shoot it猛射 forcefully, and the fire was only slightly extinguished around 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Goods in the Warehouse <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>At that time, according to company officials, Warehouse Number 15 had just been loaded with about 300坛 jars of Shaoxing wine, many mats, and brooms from Wenzhou by the *Xin Jiangtian* steamer today (yesterday). In addition, there were also stored goods such as tobacco leaves, tin foil, raw lacquer, and various medicinal materials, totaling over ten types of goods. However, all the goods were insured by the respective owners, and only the warehouse itself was insured by the company with the China Insurance Company for approximately 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e160">No Other Buildings Affected <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Warehouse Number 15 is a single-story building with two sections. The fire started in the front section, and the rear section was spared due to a very wide patio in between. Furthermore, because the walls were solidly constructed, the nearby buildings were not affected. It is understood that the warehouse was originally the property of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and the company leased the land to build the warehouse. The lease expired this year and has now been renewed for another two years.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Cause Unknown <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>As for the cause of the fire, according to company officials, it is customary for all company warehouses to be closed at 5:00 PM every day. Even if the goods are not completely moved by then, it is limited to half past. Furthermore, employees in the warehouse are strictly prohibited from smoking to prevent fires. Once each warehouse is closed, no one is left inside, and only patrolmen are responsible for patrolling the outside perimeter.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Raw Lacquer Destroyed <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of this year, Warehouse Number 14 of the company also suffered a fire, with losses equal to this time. One thing that is most astonishing is that when Warehouse Number 14 was destroyed last time, dozens of crates of raw lacquer were spared. At that time, they were moved to Warehouse Number 15 for storage. Now, Warehouse Number 15 has also been destroyed, and all the raw lacquer was burned to ashes. From this, it can be seen that even the smallest thing has a certain fate.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Over Forty Pawnshops Closed <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>There are two types of pawnshops in this city: new pawnshops and old pawnshops, totaling over one hundred and twenty. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai in 1932, almost four years have passed, and businesses have been losing money for years. Most pawnshops are partnerships, and only a few are individually owned. The shareholders of the partnered pawnshops are unwilling to continue operating. Therefore, over forty pawnshops, both old and new, throughout the city have announced closures from the second half of last year to this spring.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Abnormal Development of Pawnshops in Concessions <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The pawnshops opened in the Public Concession and the French Concession are not restricted by our government and operate freely. Most of them have redemption periods of six to eight months, and only a few have twelve months. Although the loan amount is larger than that of pawnshops, for loans with interest less than five yuan, the interest is nominally set at two percent per month, but in reality, it is divided into three periods per month, with interest taken at two percent every ten days. The total monthly interest is six percent. When poor people are in financial difficulties, they only care about the loan amount and do not care about the interest rate. Therefore, the pawnshop business is becoming increasingly developed. A current survey shows that there are over six hundred and fifty pawnshops in the two concession districts. In the midst of the decline of all industries, this cannot but be called abnormal development.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Rivalry Among Loading and Unloading Workers on Two Railways; False Accusation Case Awaits Judgment <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The loading and unloading workers at the North Station of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have always had two or three factions, engaging in mutual antagonism. Two foremen, Liu Zhaoguan and Gao Ge, both have considerable influence, leading to frequent disputes and even lawsuits in court. At 7:30 AM on May 21st of this year, a thug suddenly broke into Liu's house at No. 13 Ningkang Lane, North Zhejiang Road, and fired two shots at Liu, but both missed. Subsequently, detectives from the General Police Station arrested the assailant, Chen Keyun, who confessed that he was instructed by Li Ganrong and Cui Shitai, subordinates of Gao, and that the pistol was also given to him by Cui. The police then arrested Li and Cui and escorted them to the First Special District Court. After interrogation by Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division, many doubts were discovered. At that time, Chen confessed that he was only one foot away from Liu when he fired the gun, and that he fired two shots in a row, so how could he not have hit him? Furthermore, Chen claimed that he had held the gun horizontally, but the results of the investigation showed that the bullet marks on the chair in Liu's house were all pointing downwards, indicating that the gun was fired downwards. Chen also confessed that he had gone to Li Ganrong's house twice, but his description of the house's layout and the location of the front and back doors did not match. Given these doubts, Judge Qian determined that Chen's confession was untrue and acquitted Li and Cui. Chen was sentenced to a considerable term of imprisonment. After Li and Cui were released, they believed that this case was deliberately fabricated by Liu to avoid other lawsuits and to incriminate them, causing them to be unjustly imprisoned, which constituted a criminal offense. Therefore, they hired lawyer Fan Gang to sue Liu for false accusation in the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the Eighth Criminal Division summoned them for questioning. Liu also hired lawyer Yu Hualong to defend him. The judge then announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for the afternoon of the 9th.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Doctor Zhu Shuping Accused; Court Identifies Prescription; Ms. Sun Hu's Daughter Dies Tragically; Accusation of Negligent Homicide Against Zhu <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Shuping, a thirty-five-year-old physician from Suzhou, has been practicing medicine at No. 57 Yulin Lane, Changsha Road, for eight years. Recently, Ms. Sun Hu, a Ningbo native residing at No. 3, No. 9 Ruli, Backer Road, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Zhu of negligent practice leading to death. The main points of the lawsuit are that Sun Hu's daughter, Sanmeimei, who is three years old, suddenly suffered from a fever on May 14th. She was treated by a doctor and gradually recovered. However, because the residual illness had not been completely cleared, on June 13th, she ordered a servant to take her to the defendant for treatment. According to the defendant, it was because the Sha toxin was not thoroughly removed and her body was weak, which was dangerous, so he prescribed medicine for her to take. Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, at 11:00 PM, she suddenly sweated like oil, her mouth became clenched, her limbs became stiff, and her lips were extremely dry and red, gasping for breath. Shortly afterwards, she died. The next day, when she was being coffined, there were many purple and black marks on her body, which was very tragic. When the defendant's prescription was compared to medical books, it was discovered that the defendant used drugs such as ephedra and aconite, which was a mistake. Therefore, the child's death was not due to illness but due to the defendant's medical treatment. The plaintiff does not know how to read or write and does not understand medical theory, but she only knew to seek life in the name of fame, but instead hastened her death. Therefore, the defendant has committed the crime of negligent homicide under Article 301, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Division. The plaintiff, Sun Hu, explained the previous situation. The defendant, Zhu Shuping, stated that when the child came to my clinic, her tongue coating was white and greasy, her hands and feet were cold and stiff, her lungs were closed, and she had no tears. Her Yang energy was weak, and her illness was quite severe. At that time, I made a statement that after Sha, this phenomenon is extremely dangerous, so I prescribed a prescription. The ephedra that I used, five fen, was for opening the orifices, but I was very afraid of excessive sweating, so I used other drugs such as aconite to stop the sweating. There was no mistake in the use of drugs. Judge Liu believed that it was necessary to identify the prescription opened by the defendant in this case, and the case should be rescheduled. The defendant's lawyer then stated that because this lawyer is also a member of the National Medical Association and represents the defendant, for the sake of fairness and to avoid suspicion from the patient's family, please send it to other National Medical organizations for identification. Judge Liu ordered that the case be rescheduled for a hearing on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Li Jinxiang Kidnapping Case: Record of Interrogation of Kidnappers; Chen A'er Denies Masterminding; Swears to Heaven in Court <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Li Jinxiang, the four-year-old only son of Li Guanlin, a local farmer living in the Li family house on Remi Road in the French Concession, was kidnapped at 7:00 PM on May 13th by three armed kidnappers who broke into the house and took him away, demanding 50,000 yuan for ransom. On the afternoon of the 21st of last month, the kidnappers arranged for the victim's family to meet at Zaoqiao in Zhabei to negotiate the ransom payment. The French police then solved the case, arresting the kidnappers Zhao Taotao, the mastermind Chen A'er (aka Yongxiang), and thirty-two male and female suspects. The hostage was found on Jiangxinsha in Pudong and escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Later, after an investigation by the Police Department, nineteen male and female suspects, including Zhang Shengen, who were not involved in the case, were escorted to the court and released. The thirteen people related to the kidnapping, including Zhao Taotao, Dong Aqing, Chen Jinsheng, Chen A'er, Yang Shaobai, Ji Xiucheng, Gong Jinxiang, Xu Weiming, Fang Dalang, Su Zhaogen, Yang Hongde, Jin Heshang, and Ding Aliulu, were detained pending further interrogation. This information has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, it was the date for the continued interrogation. At 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court, accompanied by Clerk Gao Yanmao, presided over the trial in the First Tribunal. Only Ding Aliulu hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to appear in court for defense. According to lawyer Yao Zhaodi, representing the Police Department, because there were many defendants in this case, the police investigation procedures had not yet been completed, and he requested a four-day extension for further investigation and trial. The court verified the warrants and questioned the main suspects, such as Zhao Taotao, Dong Aqing, Chen Jinsheng, and Wang Jinxiang, one by one. They all confessed that the case was actually masterminded by Chen A'er. When Chen A'er was brought to court for confrontation, he flatly denied masterminding the kidnapping and swore to Heaven that he had been falsely accused. Judge Zhang verified the confessions and ordered the defendants to be returned to detention and rescheduled the trial for the 11th.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Unauthorized Operation of Tobacco Cutting Businesses; Consolidated Tax Bureau Strictly Enforces Prohibition; Notice Issued to All Tobacco Merchants Yesterday to Comply <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region has recently discovered that tobacco cutting shops in this city are privately purchasing cured tobacco leaves, cutting large quantities of tobacco shreds, and reselling them to local tobacco rolling households in the interior, or privately selling rolling paper, secretly assisting in private production and hindering national tax revenue. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Inspection Office to dispatch personnel to strictly investigate and prohibit such activities, a special notice was issued, stating that, "It has been found that Article 17 of the promulgated Cured Tobacco Leaf Collection Rules states that tobacco cutting shops may not collect or store cured tobacco leaves. If it is found that cured tobacco leaves are cut into tobacco shreds and privately sold to tobacco factories or rolling households for use in rolling cigarettes, the relevant tobacco shreds shall be subject to the consolidated cigarette tax in accordance with the regulations and shall be punished in accordance with these rules. Furthermore, it has been found that Item 2 of Article 30 of the Cigarette Paper Purchase and Transportation Rules states that if paper merchants and tobacco factories privately transport cigarette paper without obtaining an import bond, purchase permit, or transportation permit, the privately transported cigarette paper shall be confiscated and the paper merchant, tobacco factory, or cigarette paper holder shall be fined up to ten times the price of the privately transported cigarette paper. The rules and regulations for preventing private production are extremely strict. However, it has recently been discovered that tobacco cutting shops in the Tangshan Road and Gongping Road areas of this city are purchasing cured tobacco leaves, cutting tobacco shreds, and supplying them to local tobacco rolling households in the interior, or privately selling rolling paper, assisting in private production. Such unauthorized operations should be strictly investigated and prohibited in order to protect tax revenue. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Inspection Office to investigate and prosecute, this notice is hereby issued. All tobacco shred shops and transporters must be aware and must not engage in the aforementioned selling and transporting of Dong cured tobacco shreds and rolling paper. If anyone dares to violate the regulations deliberately, they will be punished without leniency once they are discovered. All must comply with this special notice."</p>

<p>Li Buchao, a native of Gaoyou, has been working for Liu Guojie's fertilizer company at No. 223 Dongjiaxing Road. Early yesterday morning, at around 1:00 AM, Liu demanded repayment of a debt, leading to an argument and a physical altercation. Hua Pu [Chinese constable] No. 3077 and Detective Xu Zhiqing from the Jiaxing Road Police Station arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested Li at the Jiaxing Road Bridge. Li's right arm suddenly began to bleed. He was taken into the police station, and it was found that there were two knife wounds. Li claimed that he had been stabbed by Liu. The police chief questioned Liu and learned that the wounds were inflicted by Liu's friend using a small knife in the midst of the altercation. This would subject Liu to criminal penalties (a common trick used by gangsters). The police chief charged Li with false accusation and filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, Li was escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated the previous situation, saying that the investigation revealed that the defendant had borrowed 80 yuan from Liu Guojie on August 29th of last year and owed 48 yuan in rent for a night soil cart for several months. When Liu demanded repayment, the defendant beat him. The knife wound on his arm was inflicted by an accomplice, and there were witnesses. A small knife was later found on the windowsill outside the entrance of Liu's company at No. 223. The circumstances of the case are complicated, and he requested an extension for further investigation. A detective then presented a report, presented the small knife for inspection, and questioned the defendant. Li claimed that the knife wound on his arm was indeed inflicted by his boss, Liu, and he was not falsely accusing him. He asked for the court to discern the truth. When questioned, Liu Guojie firmly denied it. Witness Wang Ailong testified that when the defendant walked to the Jiaxing Road Bridge, he saw a man wearing a short black silk shirt and trousers approach him and pat his right arm, saying "It doesn't matter," and then walking away. Witnesses Tao Guoshu, Song Chuwang, and Jiang Enqin also testified that they did not see Liu stab his right arm with a knife. By this time, it was almost noon. Judge Wu Zehan ordered him to be returned to detention and rescheduled the case to clarify and decide the truth.</p>

<p>Since the Central Police Station of the Public Concession moved to its new building on Fuzhou Road, the question of how to dispose of the original site between Henan Road and Fuzhou Road has been under discussion for a long time. Recently, the Board of Directors finally decided to demolish the old building of the Central Police Station. However, one of the northern buildings, which was built ten years after the completion of the old building, will be temporarily preserved. It is understood that the buildings that have now been decided to be demolished were built more than forty years ago. The exterior is showing signs of decay, and several places inside are extremely unsafe. Furthermore, with the changing times, the layout and structure are no longer suitable for today's needs. It would be uneconomical to renovate it partially. Therefore, it was decided to demolish it. It is also said that after the building is demolished, the corner of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road, and a portion of Henan Road, may be slightly widened.</p>

<p>The Chinese-Eastern Shipping Company of the Netherlands Royal Mail Line, in view of the fierce competition in the Far East shipping routes from Italy and Germany, which have recently dispatched ships, has also followed suit in competing. With substantial financial resources, the company is actively building six large ships to open routes between Asia and Africa. The first ship, "Goedemondt," left Shanghai on June 1st, passing through Bangkok, Singapore, Batavia, Port Louis, Mauritius, Réunion, Tamatave, Durban, London, Bordeaux, Zanzibar, Mombasa, Massawa, and then back through Singapore and Hong Kong before arriving in Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but was delayed due to fog along the way, and only arrived at the Wusongkou at noon yesterday. It entered the port around 1:00 PM and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong.</p>
<p>Invitation to Visit</p>
<p>This trip to China is the maiden voyage of the ship, but it is extremely crowded, with all cabins, from the deluxe suites to the ordinary class, fully booked. It also carries mail from Singapore, Réunion, and other places, which was unloaded and distributed by the postal service. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the ship's captain specially arranged for the general manager of the Java Shipping Company in Shanghai to invite various Chinese and Western newspapers in the city to visit by telephone. Many people accepted the invitation and boarded the ship for a tour, and were warmly received by the staff of the Java Company on board.</p>
<p>Departure Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The reporter from the Chinese-Eastern Shipping Company was invited to visit the ship yesterday. The interior layout of the ship is extremely perfect, with deluxe dining rooms, deluxe cabins, first-class cabins, second-class cabins, and steerage class. The conditions are comparable to those of the Norddeutscher Lloyd's "Scharnhorst." However, the ship is particularly large, with a net tonnage of 5,400 tons. It is reported that the ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow morning, heading for the South African route, and is expected to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope in Africa around August 25th, and return to Hong Kong on September 27th.</p>
<p>Five More Ships to Follow</p>
<p>As for the remaining five ships, they will also arrive in China one after another. The second ship, "Barentsz I," departed from Hong Kong on the 29th of last month, following the same route as the first ship, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 4th or 5th of next month. The third ship is the "Sweedenborg." According to news from the Java Company in Shanghai, it will also depart on the 28th of this month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early September. In addition, the fourth ship, "Roelofven," the fifth ship, "Houdtsoom," and the sixth ship, "Minderbroeder," will each depart on a monthly basis thereafter. The construction of each ship is the same as the first.</p>

<p>After the French Municipal Council decided to register rickshaw pullers within the concession starting on the 4th of this month, all licensed vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers expressed their opposition. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a general meeting of licensed vehicle owners in the French Concession was held at the Shi Cai Department of the Rickshaw Trade Association at No. 25 Lane, San Guan Tang Road. More than 300 vehicle owners and more than 50 rickshaw puller representatives attended. Zhang Zhishan, a representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Zhang Yaodong, the patrol leader of the San Guan Tang Police Station, led police officers to the scene to maintain order. After the meeting was opened by the presidium of Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, and Song Yaokun, Qiu Chunshan and Zhang Huaiyang first reported on the intention and methods of registering rickshaw pullers in the French Concession.

<p>Recently, tea boys on various ships have frequently been found by the Postal Administration to be carrying letters for merchants and passengers, and have been investigated according to law. This is not uncommon. Yesterday, the Shinrenhwa steamer arrived in Shanghai from Haimen, Qidong, and other places at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi. Upon arrival, inspectors Ju Yunpeng and Jiang Wen of the Postal Administration boarded the ship for inspection. They found 33 privately carried letters, 8 invoices, and 6 empty envelopes in the shoe box of tea boy Jiang Yuande. They then notified the Administration by telephone and dispatched personnel Lu Youcong and customs search team members, as well as detectives Yao Guofa from the Water Police Station, to the scene.

<p>Mr. Wang Xinzhai, who runs an export business, believes that the foreign trade of domestic products is declining due to the failure to improve management methods. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), he sent his eldest son, Yushan, and second son, Yulin, to study at Milton University in the United States and to conduct investigations on business operations, in order to prepare for the development and promotion of Chinese native products. It is now known that the Wang brothers have graduated and returned home on the Dollar Line's President Grant. They will examine the current situation of various export industries for about two months, and then go to the University of Wisconsin for further study.</p>

<p>Recently, some people in the city have been using the names of certain foreign firms, order numbers, or companies to privately trade security deposits, taking a commission of three or four jiao per unit. Anyone can trade as long as they pay ten or five yuan. There are dozens of such illegal transactions. Ignorant people, greedy for expediency, are often fooled by them. Such a disguised gambling den is not good for society. After being detected by the supervisors of the Exchange, they have announced to the gold market that such activities are strictly prohibited and have reported to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau to strictly ban them.</p>

<p>The Xin Xin She reported that the Nantong Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that our members Chen Baoshan, Zou Shisong, and more than 300 others have jointly written to us, stating (omitted). We have approved this. The market is extremely depressed. All businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the situation of the small cargo vehicle industry is particularly dire. At this critical juncture, when the market is in a precarious state, we are seeking to reduce rents and taxes. How can we allow further tax increases? We believe that the concession authorities' measures violate the current situation and cannot be borne by the taxpayers. The resulting malpractices will only increase the market crisis and drive the entire industry and commerce to ruin. We feel a sense of danger and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are specially reporting to your association and requesting that you consider the difficulties of industry and commerce and quickly negotiate with the concession authorities to stop the proposal to increase taxes on cargo vehicles, so as to lighten the burden, which is fair and convenient."</p>
<h3 id="e179">Tea Party for Chinese and Western Art Circles in Huang's Garden <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a tea party for Chinese and Western art circles was held in Huang's Garden in Caohejing. This event was co-hosted by Mr. Huang Jinyong, honorary president of the Sino-Foreign Drama Research Association, and famous actors Zhou Xinfang and Hua Huilin. More than 100 people attended, including men and women from the Chinese and Western drama circles and those interested in the study of Peking Opera, as well as journalists. At 5:30 PM, everyone took their seats, which were arranged in a mountain shape. After some refreshments were served, the host, Huang Jinyong, on behalf of Zhu Lianfu, introduced Zhou Xinfang and Hua Huilin as guests, and Xie Fusheng translated in English. Then Zhou Xinfang stood up and gave a speech, briefly stating that the motive for planning to adapt and perform "Hong Zong Lie Ma" (Red-Maned Horse) was that Dr. Xiyi's translation of "Wang Baochuan" was well received by the British in London. Recently, Karl Faw has also performed a similar version in Shanghai and received high praise from Western expatriates. However, the most important part of Chinese drama is still in the "singing and dancing," and Westerners have not yet been able to see the whole picture through English performances. With the assistance of Mr. Huang Jinyong, it is planned to be staged at the Golden Grand Theater on the 10th of this month. The old Peking Opera version of "Wang Baochuan," also known as "Hong Zong Lie Ma," takes four or five hours to perform, from the throwing of the embroidered ball to the grand ascension to the throne. In order to cater to foreign guests, it has been specially adapted and deleted to allow them to clearly understand the entire story of "Wang Baochuan" in the most economical time. At that time, we also ask gentlemen from all walks of life to give us criticism and guidance so that Chinese drama can step into the right track, etc. Then Zhu Lianfu, the representative of the Sino-Foreign Drama Research Association, stood up and reported briefly that although the Sino-Foreign Drama Research Association is a newly discovered group name, its history is already 20 or 30 years old. This group was organized and established during our student days. In addition to regular research, we occasionally performed during holidays. Now, with the advocacy of Mr. Huang Jinyong and the cooperation of Zhou Xinfang and Hua Huilin, we plan to present the English-translated famous play "Wang Baochuan," which has caused a sensation in the British Isles and in Shanghai, to the Westerners in its true form. We will improve the bad aspects and reduce the complicated aspects as an experiment to improve Peking Opera, etc. Finally, Mr. Mo, an American and vice president of the Sino-Foreign Drama Research Association, was invited to speak. He briefly stated that foreigners are most interested in three things in Chinese drama: one is the loud gongs and drums, the second is the dazzling costumes, and the third is the face towels and melon seeds. When the tea servants pass around the face towels, they are often afraid that they will fall by mistake, but nothing ever happens. However, in my opinion, this feature does not need to be abolished. Also, Western dramas, such as those of Shakespeare, all pay attention to realism, but on the Chinese stage, cloth can be used as a city, a whip can be used as a horse, and although we do not understand what is being sung, Chinese civilization can be seen in this. For example, heroes are worshiped by everyone, and evil people eventually get their due. Foreigners who have seen the play "Wang Baochuan" have expressed strong dissatisfaction with Wei Hu and feel that it is indeed right to behead him on stage as a warning to the public. As for music, there are many wonderful changes. Today, I am honored to be invited by Mr. Huang Jinyong and Mr. Zhou Hua and I would like to express my sincere thanks on behalf of all foreigners, etc. Finally, the host delivered a thank-you speech, and everyone dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Great Turnaround in the Pickled Mustard Tuber Industry <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Pickled mustard tuber from Sichuan is a special food product of China. It has been sold to various shops in Shanghai for years and transported to various ports, and it is very popular. This year, due to slightly higher production and oversupply, the value has been lowered and plummeted. Both buyers and sellers have suffered losses. Now, the sellers have seen this and the Shanghai Sichuan Pickled Vegetable Transport Industry Association held a meeting to discuss and decided to temporarily stop transporting goods that have not been transported from Sichuan, so as to ensure that the supply and demand of the goods that have been transported are equal. Since the implementation, the price has slightly improved. Unexpectedly, a few vegetable shops have violated the proposal and suddenly transported vegetables to Shanghai again, causing the price to remain low. Fortunately, after the Association discovered this, in addition to keeping all the bills of lading for the newly arrived vegetables from being sold by the Association, it also imposed a special heavy fine. It was also publicly agreed that if the remaining vegetables are not sold to 80%, they will no longer be transported to Shanghai. If they persist to the end in this way, balancing supply and demand, the pickled mustard tuber industry will surely have a great turnaround in the future.</p>

<p>The most difficult thing is to understand the culture of a foreign country. However, sometimes this kind of understanding is really necessary. It is truly impossible to fully understand its culture without being a part of it. However, foreigners can at least grasp the general idea and get its hints. From this, sympathy and appreciation arise. How happy and grateful one should be when such an opportunity arises. The modern Chinese painting exhibition held this time under the supervision of the China Association (composed of Chinese and British people, with the Chinese Minister as the president) and the British Chamber of Commerce China Association (organized by British people who have business relations with China) closed last week at the New Burlington Galleries. Its effect is not only to give us a kind of hint, but also to express the spirit of the world's oldest culture, now in turmoil. This obvious manifestation of culture may remind the world that the solution to the Chinese problem depends not only on trade, tariffs, concessions, investment, and so on, but also on the future of this culture itself. Now, if we want to save this culture, we must first have a full understanding of it, which is very obvious. The West's efforts to help China will hardly succeed unless they have the same understanding of Chinese culture and its prosperity. Although China can lend us useful weapons, we are still considered barbarians. And the Chinese people in our limited light only know to be the masses of people who are sacrificed by revolution, natural disasters, famine, war, and the Communist Party, forgetting that they are the most cultured people in the world.</p>
<p>However, from Chinese pottery, sculpture, poetry, and painting, we can recognize the height and elegance of its cultural attainments. Looking at the modern Chinese paintings displayed at the New Burlington Galleries, we can see that although China seems to be in a state of chaos, its wisdom and elegance are still preserved without any loss. This is even more surprising. The Sichuan area has become a fierce battle zone between Marshal Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist bandits in the minds of newspaper readers, but Ms. Wu Xingfen depicts it with wonderful Chinese brushwork, without losing its beautiful scenery. The works of modern Chinese painters - or especially Mr. Liu Haisu - are enough to prove that although China has gone through various difficulties such as the National Revolution, the Communist disturbance, and the Japanese occupation, what the Chinese people regard as most precious is still a dignified and unrestrained outlook on life, and their spiritual feelings are revealed in their brush and ink, with a gentle and pure atmosphere. Chinese brushwork has a close relationship with poetry and is used by the Chinese to express their feelings. Gu Shusen's "Bamboo After Rain" is sketched with a few strokes, extremely light and淡泊. Westerners who suddenly see it may think that it is meaningless and lacks the sharp effect of Western art. However, if you look at it quietly, you can understand that a few bamboo trees have absorbed the author's spiritual feelings, and his benevolent, gentle, and poetic demeanor. At the same time, the changes in his brushwork are the result of strict training of his hands and eyes. Chinese painting is probably the most direct and pure tool for expressing human feelings, just as Chinese philosophy is the most humane philosophy. Both philosophy and painting are produced from a firm and gentle outlook on life. As for the evaluation of Chinese art, we can ask Mr. Liu Haisu, or the literary critic Mr. Laurence Binson, Mr. Hobcoo, and the gentlemen who promoted the exhibition of Chinese antiquities this winter. If we visit the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and visit the Eumorfopoulos's collection of Chinese art that is currently on display, we can get a more intimate and correct judgment. These works of art, whether they are painted with peach blossoms in full bloom or colorful pottery, or even huge bronze objects, all express a delicate, gorgeous, and deeply poetic feeling. Its form and the Chinese artistic skills and traditions contained in it are enough to make people feel happy and admire it endlessly. This exhibition of modern paintings shows people that this kind of exquisite and symmetrical feature still remains in today's turbulent China. However, if we, like Nietzsche, seem to admire art but despise it in our hearts, then we may think that this kind of exquisite symmetry is too fragile, out of date, and especially unsuitable for the conflicting and fighting present world. If we are troubled by this kind of stupid idea, then a look at the Buddha statues in the exhibition will benefit us a lot. In this kind of heroic and pure portrayal, we can see a kind of Qi and strength that is softened by Buddhism, and Chinese art is originally born out of Buddhism. Think about it, the Chinese people have already used their great wisdom to make good use of their original warrior spirit, and only apply it to poetry, art, and life. If they break through the barriers and turn to militarism, what will be the result? This is not only a hint to us, but also a warning to us. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e195">Summary of the Municipal Zoo in the 23rd Year: More Than 1,059,000 Visitors; Ticket Revenue Exceeds 17,800 Yuan <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in the South City originally had a land area of only seven mu and three fen. In the 23rd year, in addition to applying to purchase private land, it also took over municipal public land. Currently, the area has been expanded to nine mu and a few fen. There are 78 kinds of large and small animals such as tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, peacocks, and white cranes. Currently, the buildings are being repaired and a specimen room is being added. In addition to a large whale over four zhang long, which can be rushed to be produced and displayed in the shortest time, other animal specimens that are not easy to raise must also be collected for the audience to appreciate. In the past year, in addition to being closed on 例　　, it was open for 306 days. The total number of visitors was 1,059,781, with an average of 3,463 visitors per day. Among them, the most visitors were on the 5th (the old New Year's Day), with a total of 15,766 people, which can be called a new record since the opening of the zoo. The fewest visitors were on June 2, with only 208 people, because it was raining heavily that day. Looking at the park from its opening until now, it has been two years, and the crowd still flocks to visit and learn, and the interest has not diminished, which shows that the zoo's adaptation to the citizens is indeed very necessary. Because the area of the park is narrow, in order to avoid crowding and facilitate management, admission tickets are charged. It is stipulated that adults pay six copper coins, children and military police pay half, and groups are free. The total revenue from tickets in the 23rd year was 17,818 yuan, one jiao, and six fen.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Aquatic Carnival at the Zhongqing Swimming Pool Last Night Was Extremely Grand <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The first aquatic carnival organized by the Sichuan Road Youth Association was held at the Zhongqing Swimming Pool at 7:30 last night. The program was rich, and the interest was lively. The Datong News Agency reporter entered the venue at 7 o'clock, and it was already full of people, with no empty seats. It can be said that it was extremely grand. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Public Events</p>
<p>There were as many as six public events last night. After the start, Chief Referee Ling Xitao reported first, and then the competition began. The first event was the 50-yard public freestyle. There were three participants, all of whom were not members of the Zhongqing team. The result was 30.3 seconds, which was quite difficult. The second public event was the 100-yard backstroke. Because no one registered, it was changed to a performance by members of the Zhongqing team. There was only one Chen Wenhe for the 200-yard public freestyle. He temporarily pulled Zhongqing Shi Bogen to swim with him. Shi was a Hong Kong inter-port athlete, and was certainly not Chen's opponent. This item requires 20 round trips. When the finish line was reached, Chen was still two laps behind. Shi's result was 2 minutes and 25 seconds, which was considered the most exciting of all the results last night. Only Misses Chen, Liu and Zhou participated in the two women's public events. Among them, Miss Chen Baoxuan was the most outstanding.</p>
<p>Two Relay Races</p>
<p>Among the two relay races, the most interesting one was the mixed relay. The distance of this item was 60 yards, and it had to be circled around the pool three times. In the Liang Chen Yu group, Miss Chen was the most hardworking. When Liang's 20 yards arrived, the three groups were almost indistinguishable. As a result, Miss Chen relied on an arm to take the lead, and Yu Rongji reaped the rewards. In the three-style relay, the first group's result of one minute and sixteen seconds was quite difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Fancy Swimming</p>
<p>The first item, apple swimming, had a distance of 40 yards. Four apples were floated at 20 yards. When swimming to that place, the apple had to be unloaded with the mouth. Because of the waves of the water, it was not easy to enter the mouth. As a result, Liang Weisheng arrived first, but after the referee found out that he had used his hand, he was disqualified. The two items of driving backwards and blind man stealing the bell were full of interest. The visitors were all laughing. In the candle swimming, only Yu and Lu arrived, and the rest were extinguished halfway. In the three-legged swimming, only one foot of two people was tied together. As a result, only the Zhang Liang group arrived, and the rest of the Jian Zhou group was loosened and cancelled halfway.</p>
<p>Tug-of-War and Diving</p>
<p>The tug-of-war was divided into married and unmarried teams. As a result, the unmarried team won both times. Referee Chen Fuzhang also stood in the water, which can be said to be dedicated to his duties. Fancy diving was judged by Liang Weisheng, Zhou Ruiqin, and Zhang Rongguang. As a result, Zheng Zhenren won the chief with 55 and a half points. Yu Rongji was in second place with a difference of half a point. Unfortunately, the last two items, the Lianzhupao, were performed by seven people leaping into the water in a series, (the latter holding the feet of the former and leaping down one after another), which won the applause.</p>
<p>Water Polo Match</p>
<p>Shanghai water polo matches have never been seen. It was only held once when the Hong Kong team came to Shanghai last time. This item originally required four people to be divided into two teams. Yesterday, because there were too few people, only five people were in a team, as a performance. They were divided into unmarried and married teams. The match lasted 14 minutes. In the first half, Zhang Rongguang of the unmarried team opened the scoring (Zhang was a Hong Kong water polo expert). Soon after, Liang Weisheng of the married team returned a goal, but before long, Zhou Ruiqin of the unmarried team created a two-on-one situation. After a while, Zhou Dayun of the unmarried team passed a long ball, which hit the target. However, the silver whistle blew, announcing that the time had been counted, and it was unanimously cancelled. After that, the married team made no progress. The unmarried team's passing was superb, and Zhou Dayun scored again. Zhang Rongguang then scored two more goals in a row. As a result, the unmarried team won with a score of five to one, which shows that the unmarried team's energy storage and strength were sufficient, which the married team could not hope for.</p>

<p>The Number of Students Studying in Various Countries Increases Compared to Previous Years</p>
<p>Several Agencies in this City Handle Procedures for Going Abroad</p>
<p>European and American Students Go Abroad No Later Than August</p>
<p>The 23rd year has ended. During this summer vacation, the number of graduates from various universities who are going abroad at their own expense or at public expense has increased compared to previous years, according to investigations by reporters from the Shanghai News Agency. The British Returned Students Association in this city has formed a special committee to handle the procedures for going abroad, which is convenient for students. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Number of Students Going Abroad Increases Sharply</p>
<p>The semester has now ended. Graduates from domestic public and private colleges and universities are making preparations to study abroad. According to investigations by reporters from the Shanghai News Agency, the number of students going to the United States this year, whether at their own expense or at public expense, will be more than 200. The main reason is the decline in the US dollar and the lower cost of living. The number of students going to the United Kingdom and Germany who have already completed the procedures for going abroad has also increased compared to previous years. Although studying in Japan has recently been subject to the restrictions of the Ministry of Education's pre-planned funding storage in banks, most students have not followed the Ministry's procedures. Therefore, the number of people going to Japan has not decreased. In addition, there are relatively few students going to France, Italy, Belgium, and Austria. As for the subjects studied by the students, politics and economics are still the most popular, followed by science.</p>
<p>Agencies Handle Procedures</p>
<p>In this city, in addition to the Universal Student Association, the London Chinese Students Association and the British Returned Xingjian Society have recently organized special committees to handle reception and consultation matters on a completely voluntary basis. In addition, the China Travel Service has been handling the procedures for American students going abroad for many years. Now, in order to facilitate the departure of this year's students, it has reserved several large ships for American students to travel on. If you have any questions, the agency can also answer them. All forms and other items can be sent free of charge.</p>
<p>Academic Year Begins in Various Countries</p>
<p>Academic Year Begins in Universities in Various Countries</p>
<p>Most European schools start in mid-October and early November, while American schools start in mid-September. The timing of going abroad depends on each individual's situation, but those going to Europe and the United States must leave no later than early August. All the procedures that need to be completed before going abroad must be prepared as early as possible, and those studying in the United States must first obtain admission permission from the school they wish to attend before proceeding with other procedures. All matters related to studying abroad can be consulted with the above-mentioned agencies.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Contribution to the Little Friends Who Have Dropped Out of School and Found Employment (Talk) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Yun</p>
<p>Every summer vacation, a large number of little friends graduate from elementary school. Among these little friends, some are lucky and some are unlucky. The lucky little friends can still continue to enter middle school, while the unlucky little friends can only drop out of school and find employment.</p>
<p>I hope that these little friends who have dropped out of school and found employment will not be discouraged, because many of the great people in the world did not graduate from formal schools. Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, is the best example. At the same time, I would like to contribute some words on employment to these little friends.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between noble and lowly occupations. There are treasures hidden in every occupation. Dig with a hoe and you will find them; but there are good and bad occupations. The so-called good occupation is one that suits you; the so-called bad occupation is one that does not suit you.</p>
<p>It can be seen that when we choose an occupation, we must take into account our abilities and interests. We can be competent in an occupation that suits our abilities and interests, and there is hope for development in the future; however, an occupation that does not suit our abilities and interests will make us feel bored and bored at work, and there will never be hope for development.</p>
<p>No matter what occupation, as long as it suits our abilities and interests, it is good—if we can work hard. Lazy, unmotivated people, any occupation is bad, and he will never have hope of gaining a foothold in the industry for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Yue Fei's Childhood (A Story) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Si Qiu</p>
<p>During the era of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, there was a national hero who was both accomplished in literature and martial arts, and possessed both benevolence and wisdom. This person was none other than Yue Fei, whom we all know.</p>
<p>His courtesy name was Pengju. He was from Tangyin County in present-day Henan Province, and his family had been farmers for generations. His father was a very honest and kind-hearted gentleman. It is said that when Yue Fei was born, there was a legend: at the very moment he was born, a large Peng bird suddenly flew from the southeast corner, constantly flying and chirping above the house. Therefore, he was named Fei (which means "fly"), and some superstitious people even associated him with being the reincarnation of the Peng bird. But in reality, such things do not exist.</p>
<p>He was born less than a month before encountering the Yellow River flood, and Tangyin became a watery country overnight. His mother, Yao, panicked because of the sudden surge of water, so she held Yue Fei and sat in a large vat, letting it drift wherever it may. Fortunately, his life was not destined to end there. He floated around in the waves and eventually found a savior.</p>
<p>As Yue Fei grew older, he possessed an extraordinary air. None of the other children who played with him could compare to him. Yue Fei's family was very poor, but he was very diligent in his studies, especially Zuo Zhuan and Sun Tzu's Art of War, which suited his taste the most.</p>
<p>He was born with great strength and could easily lift things weighing several hundred pounds without considering it a big deal. In his hometown, there was a hero named Zhou Tong who often recognized Yue Fei's talents and was willing to teach him archery for free. He also gave him his two favorite bows. Yue Fei was naturally very grateful to have such an understanding mentor. But unfortunately, Zhou Tong died soon after. Yue Fei was very saddened by the loss of his mentor and friend, so every first and fifteenth day of the lunar month, he would prepare a cup of wine and a bowl of meat, take the bow given by Zhou Tong, and go to his grave to pay respects and weep before returning. However, Yue Fei was extremely poor, so where would he get the money to buy wine and meat? Therefore, every time he made an offering, he had to sell a piece of clothing to be able to go to the grave.</p>
<p>After some time, his father noticed that his clothes were decreasing day by day and thought he was selling them for improper purposes, so he called him over to question him. Yue Fei had to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Although his father was a gentle man, he was very insightful. After Yue Fei spoke to him, he couldn't help but sigh and say, "The country is in trouble now. The Jin soldiers are taking an inch and want a mile, invading endlessly. At such a young age, you already have such loyalty and righteousness. When you have the opportunity to serve the country in the future, you will surely become a loyal subject who sacrifices himself for the country!" Yue Fei replied, "If my father allows me to dedicate myself to the country, what else would I not dare to do?" His father couldn't help but exclaim, "With a son like this, what else do I have to worry about!"</p>
<p>Later, Yue Fei indeed defeated the Jin soldiers and recovered much lost territory. Unfortunately, he was framed by the treacherous minister Qin Hui and could not fulfill his ambitions. Only his heroic name remains forever in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Rubber (Common Sense) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>"Brother, is the rubber we use peeled from the skin of elephants?" Min'er asked, holding a piece of rubber in his hand while working on his diary. He looked at the rubber for a while and then put down his pencil.</p>
<p>"No, little brother. Rubber comes from a rubber tree that grows in tropical regions. It can release a milky sap, and people use this sap to make rubber," Cong'er replied happily.</p>
<p>"Then are the basketball shoes we wear made of rubber? Why are they so hard?"</p>
<p>"Some rubber is very hard, and some people don't think of it as rubber. For example, the barrel of a fountain pen is all rubber, but it is made differently by adding different amounts of chemicals during manufacturing."</p>
<p>"Brother, can you tell me how rubber is made?"</p>
<p>"Okay, let me tell you: First, carve a deep groove into the rubber tree, and then the sap will slowly flow out and into a bucket. The natives there take a wooden stick, dip it in the rubber sap, and bake it over a stove. By dipping and baking like this, it gradually becomes a very thick sheet of rubber, but this is just the raw material for rubber and cannot be used directly. However, factories don't make it this way. They first add vinegar to the rubber tree sap, which turns it into crude rubber, which is very soft and elastic. But this is also not suitable for use because it will become brittle after being exposed to the air for a long time. Therefore, they add ten percent sulfur and a metallic compound to this crude rubber, and then put it in an airtight container and bake it to fifteen degrees Celsius. It then becomes very elastic and durable rubber. This is the rubber we use to erase writing. If you add ten to fifty percent sulfur to the crude rubber and bake it to one hundred and eighty degrees Celsius, it will become a very hard rubber that can be used to make the barrel of a fountain pen and gramophone records."</p>
<h3 id="e224">Iron-Eating Worms (Common Sense) <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you find this topic strange? Iron is so hard! Surely this worm must be very big! But this worm is actually extremely small. Don't be surprised; let me tell you all about it.</p>
<p>Many years ago, in the west of South America, trains were often derailed. So everyone studied the cause of this, and the result was that the tracks were as soft as cotton, and therefore easily broken. Some people thought that someone was playing a prank by spreading iron-corroding medicine on it, but after detailed investigation, the truth was revealed, and it was definitely not caused by spreading iron-corroding medicine. The investigation revealed that it was a small black worm, no more than six fen long, that was lying on the tracks and eating iron, causing the iron to soften and break.</p>
<p>Subsequently, someone caught a worm in the railway track and tried it on the old railway track. At first, it was seen to be lying dormant, but after the smell of iron became apparent, it could not resist any longer and moved slowly. Railway workers saw it shoot out a kind of liquid onto the iron before eating it, and then the worm's body stuck tightly to it, like a bee or butterfly sucking nectar from the heart of a flower. The iron it sucked immediately softened like cotton.</p>
<p>After the experiment, it was learned that this worm could eat thirty-six yards of railway track (equivalent to nine zhang in Chinese measure, so each worm can eat about six chi and five cun of railway track per day).</p>

<p>Some of the children thought for a while and replied, "The ten-jin stone must fall faster and reach the ground first."</p>
<p>The science teacher said, "You are wrong. People in the past thought the same way as you, believing that heavy objects must fall faster than light objects. Later, there was an Italian scientist named Galileo. He said: Heavy objects and light objects fall at the same speed. Because he wanted to prove his statement, he gathered many people one day to watch his experiment. He dropped a ten-pound cannonball and a one-pound cannonball from a high tower at the same time, and indeed, his words were not wrong at all. The two cannonballs, one heavy and one light, fell to the ground at the same time and made a sound at the same time."</p>
<p>One of the children stood up and asked, "But sometimes, when we drop a feather or a piece of paper and a copper coin at the same time, why does the copper coin reach the ground while the feather or piece of paper is still floating in the air? Isn't this evidence that heavy objects fall faster than light objects?"</p>
<p>The science teacher smiled and said, "It's good that you are so attentive. I'll tell you, this is because the paper or feather is hindered by the air. Although the copper coin is also hindered by the air, its falling momentum is greater, unlike the paper or feather, which is greatly hindered by the air. If you put the paper, feather, and copper coin in a long glass tube, remove the air, and drop them from above, you will see that they reach the bottom at the same time."</p>
<p>At this time, he took out a copper coin and a piece of thin paper from his pocket, cut the paper into a circle slightly smaller than the copper coin, and stacked it on top of the copper coin (as shown in the first picture—during the experiment, the paper must be tightly attached to the copper coin to prevent air from leaking in), and then said:</p>
<p>"Now this piece of paper is stacked on top of the copper coin, so it is not hindered by the air, so—" As he spoke, he released the copper coin between his fingers, and the paper followed the copper coin to the ground, "Did you see it clearly?"</p>
<p>He then cut the paper into a circle larger than the copper coin and stacked it on top of the copper coin (as shown in the second picture). As soon as he released his fingers, the copper coin fell to the ground in a flash, but the paper was hindered by the air and floated around for a while before falling to the ground.</p>
<p>"This experiment is very easy to do, I hope you all go back and try it."</p>

<p>— Yu Yue</p>
<p>Little friends! When you go to school with your schoolbags on your backs, have you seen pushcarts (also known as tiger cars) loaded with coal, iron bars, wood, or cloth on the road? The function of this kind of car is very important; the goods in many stores are transported from the warehouse to the store every day by it. It does not use electricity, nor does it use volatile oil; it relies entirely on four wheels to walk. When we want to use it, we only need to push the four wheels, and push it along with the momentum, and it can move forward. This kind of car is divided into two types, large and small. The large one has only two wheels, placed in the middle of the car, which is because of the effect of the center of gravity. The raw material for these cars is wood. Now you are all children, unable to pull a saw or lift a hammer, how can you make a large pushcart? But here are two small pushcarts that don't require effort or cost money, try making them!</p>
<p>Take two empty large matchboxes, cut out the wheels and the car handle from the cover. Cut the C shell into a car box (as shown in Figure 1). In addition, use a matchstick and divide it into two sections (the small one requires matches). Sharpen both ends of the match head. First, use a needle to drill a hole in the center of the car box and the car wheel, and then insert the sharpened matchstick to make an axle. In this way, you have made two small pushcarts that do not require effort or capital! (As shown in Figure 2)</p>
<h3 id="e229">Benefits of Laughter (Hygiene) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Lost</p>
<p>Little friends! Laughter is an expression of joy, I am sure you all know that. When our hearts are filled with joy, we naturally start to laugh, and at the same time, we feel very happy. But what are the benefits of laughter for our bodies? This is something we need to study ourselves.</p>
<p>According to physiologists, "Laughter can increase the pulsation of the heart, increase deep breathing, and exercise the muscles of the chest. These things can allow a large amount of oxygen to pass through the blood, which can make the blood circulate quickly throughout the body. This is a reason for improving health."</p>
<p>Therefore, most hygienists now advocate that people with weak bodies do not need to take tonics, as long as they can laugh a few times a day, the benefits are greater than taking tonics. Therefore, in recent years, many people have been specifically studying comedies and jokes, providing materials for laughter to replace tonics.</p>
<p>Dear little friends, there are also many tonics for you to eat in the Children's Weekly, do you know?</p>
<p>Please note that the Chinese Children's Culture Association will broadcast today from 12:00 to 1:00 PM on the New New Radio Station (frequency 780). Mr. Lin Yin will tell the "New Cowherd and Weaver Girl Story," and the children's choir organized by the association will broadcast songs. Please pay attention to listening at that time. It is also heard that the association is broadly recruiting male, female, and child members. Those who wish to join can write to the association at No. 457, 2nd Floor, Henan Road, Cheng.</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Having done what I had to do, I obtained the king's permission to board the ship and depart, returning as early as I could.</p>
<p>We hadn't gone far when armored warriors came towards us and seized our ship. They killed the sailors who refused to surrender to them. Then they took the rest of us away, because they intended to make us work like slaves.</p>
<p>They took our good clothes from us, giving us tattered clothes instead. Before long, we arrived at a small island, and they sold us off like slaves.</p>
<p>I was bought by a rich man, who paid the money, took me to his house, and gave me food, drink, and fine clothes. A few days passed, and then one day my master said to me, "Do you know anything about business?"</p>
<p>I said, "I used to be a merchant, but those who sold me to you took all my goods long ago."</p>
<p>He said, "Tell me, can you draw a bow and shoot?"</p>
<p>I told him, "I was good at archery when I was young," thinking that I was still quite good at shooting. Hearing me say this, he gave me a bow and several arrows. We both rode elephants and set off to a large forest a few miles from the town.</p>
<p>When we reached the forest, he told me to climb a tall tree and shoot at the elephants passing near me from between the branches, because this forest had very large beasts. He instructed me to report to him when I had shot one, gave me some food, left me there, and returned to town himself.</p>
<p>I kept watching very carefully, but didn't see anything. Then the next morning came, and I saw a large crowd from the tree.</p>
<p>As they came closer, I aimed and shot at them. I wasn't lucky at first, but eventually I hit one and it fell. The rest all fled, and once they were out of my sight, I came down from the tree and set off for town to tell my master that I had killed a beast.</p>
<p>He was very happy when he heard my news; he gave me a good meal, and then we took the road to the forest. There we dug a very deep hole, placing the dead elephant inside. Having done this, the meat of the dead beast rotted, and then the tusks, other teeth, and remaining parts could be sold for a lot of money.</p>

<p>— Rebound of Twelve Yuan and One Jiao —</p>
<p>After the gold market's previous closing price turned downwards, no one expected the London silver market to fail to align. Instead, it dropped 0.25 after closing. Yesterday, sentiment suddenly turned around, and the rising trend resurfaced, almost approaching the 40-yuan mark. It was reported that the overseas silver market was generally flat in the morning, with floor traders saying that India was selling after closing and the United States was buying below the listed price of 0.25, with a few transactions occurring at this price. The forward silver price in Montreaux fell by 0.5 fen, ranging from 7 to 7.5 li. The exchange rate slightly lengthened in London, and the price of London gold remained unchanged. Sentiment continued to turn upwards. Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened, shouting prices of 38 to 39 yuan but with no sellers. It immediately rose to 36 to 37 yuan, at which point major players began to supply. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with the British pound flat and the US dollar rising. The customs gold unit remained unchanged, and the benchmark price for gold was still listed at 863 yuan and two jiao, falling to 32 to 33 yuan. The exchange market tightened after the opening, immediately announcing a rise. However, due to the Central Bank and Shanghai's efforts to sell shillings, sellers were able to operate, and the rising momentum was temporarily halted, announcing a downstream movement. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing was announced, with both British and American currencies flat, still fluctuating. However, the bank's selling intentions were strong, and it finally turned downwards. But sentiment was still good, and there was considerable support at low prices, making it easy to rebound. Reports from the Hong Kong market were also soft, and lacking sellers, it stimulated buying interest, turning high again. Afterwards, although the bank intervened, foreign exchange rates for British and American currencies tightened due to companies settling current US dollar accounts, and buying interest continued to be strong, once rising close to the 40-yuan mark. The bank seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, and major players slightly reduced their holdings, leveling off slightly at noon. However, it remained firm after the close. The situation was quite firm throughout the morning, seemingly hazy in the middle, but the overall trend remained uncertain. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 832 yuan and eight jiao, a rebound of eight yuan compared to the previous close. Large Fa Yong's sales contract retreated from 3.5 yuan to 2.5 yuan. The exchange market tightened, and it was difficult to settle US dollars at 75 in August. Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Fu Xing Yong Yuan, Yi Fu Sheng, and Yong Lai Jin rose to seven yuan. Fu Yu, Chun Yuan, Yong Qing Fa, Yong Hui Xiang, and Heng Yu sold, falling back to four yuan. It was learned that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing was flat for both British and American currencies, and they presented offers. Fu Xing Yong worked hard to purchase contracts, while Da Fa Yong, Da De Cheng, and Heng Yu sold, and they contended around five yuan. After entry, the Central Bank was still willing to sell, and Shanghai also sold seven pence for July shillings. Da De Cheng, Wan Xing, Fu Xing Yong, and Heng Yu sold, falling to 2.1 yuan. Wan Feng, Tong Fu, Hui Xiang, Shen Feng, Heng Chang, Yong Ding Kang, Hong Kang Yong, and Chun Yuan took advantage of the low prices to maintain, rising to 6.2 yuan. Huabi released US dollars at 75 in August. Da De Cheng, De Li, Yuan Chang Yong, and Heng Yu were still selling at 3.6 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate tightened to 0625, with no sellers on the floor. Wan Feng, Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, etc. all entered, rising to 6.6 yuan. Chang Da sold, retreating to 5.3 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate tightened again to 0625. Hou Chang Yong, Shen Feng, Fu Xing Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Yi Yi Cheng, and Qing Fa Yong all entered, rebounding to 8.3 yuan. Da Ying released US dollars at 687 in August. Fu Xing Yong, Li Chang, Da De Cheng, and Heng Chang Yong took advantage of the high prices to sell, falling to 6.4 yuan. British and American currencies paired with current US dollars at 375. Yi Feng Yong Chang, Da Yi Cheng, Tong Tai Chang Ying, and Xiang, etc. successively submitted contracts, rising to 9.5 yuan. Da De Cheng and Fu Xing Yong took advantage of the high prices to sell contracts, gradually retreating to 836 yuan and nine jiao. After the close, Yuan Mao Yong, etc. all purchased, rising to about eight yuan. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 839 yuan and a half, and the lowest price was 832 yuan and one jiao, a fluctuation of seven yuan and four jiao. As a result, it rebounded by twelve yuan and one jiao compared to the previous drop.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the Central Bank's bidding benchmark price, with our listing at 863 yuan and two jiao, approximately 26 yuan higher than the closing price, a decrease of twelve yuan compared to the previous withholding. The accounting price for this month was 837 yuan, and for August, it was 837 yuan. The morning makeup water was 837 yuan. The price of pure gold only increased by nine yuan, to 841 yuan and eight jiao. The spot market situation was even more sluggish, lacking buyers. Tianjin goods only added ten yuan, and picked up goods added thirteen yuan. Ying Feng Heng sold over 100 taels to silver shops. The swap premium was still high, but there were few transactions. Short positions needed to add four yuan, mainly because there were few short sellers, making the spot market extremely sluggish.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was average. In summary, Rui Xing, Yuan Heng, Yi Feng Yong, Shen Feng, Yi Cheng, Fu Xing Yong, Shun Mao, Hou Chang Yong, Tong Tai Chang Ding, Kang Ren Fa Yong, Da Chang Xiang Yuan, Mao Yong Heng Yu, etc. were on the buying side. Chun Yuan Yong, Yuan Chang Yong Yu, Qing Yong Yuan, Sheng Yong Jia Run, Da Da Yong Li, Hui Xiang Da De Cheng, Da Fa Yong Fu Tai Yong Yuan, Heng Chang Yong, etc. were on the selling side.

After customs, the Central Bank of Shanghai took advantage of the high price to sell shillings. The HSBC Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both the British pound and the US dollar flat. However, as the bank's appetite was inclined to sell, it once became rigid, but Chinese merchants were willing to accept it, so it was maintained. The Hong Kong exchange rate also tended to tighten, and market sentiment rebounded. In addition, the British American Tobacco Company settled in spot US dollars, causing the process to gradually tighten. However, the bank still took advantage of the high price to sell.

<h3 id="e235">Securities: Chips Loosen, Government Bonds Fall Again, Major Short Sellers Dump Gold, Causing Another Yuan Drop <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market was affected by the loosening of chips on the trading floor, and a wave of declines arose. All bonds fell sharply. Although retail investors tried to rally the market, it temporarily stabilized. However, with the increasing supply of actual goods, the bulls could not withstand the selling pressure. As a result, the decline continued after a pause. In the end, each bond fell by about one yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the situation on the trading floor, it is difficult to see a turnaround in the future trend. Yesterday, at the opening in the morning, sellers were very active, especially those selling No. 44 and No. 23 bonds. Although No. 48 and No. 53 bonds tried to absorb the selling pressure, the supply still exceeded demand. All bonds were affected and fell by five cents to four jiao each. In the second session, the selling pressure remained strong, and the prices fell by about half a yuan. Before the opening of the afternoon market, the previous declines continued. Salt tax bonds and the like temporarily stabilized due to some short covering. At the close, sellers reappeared, and the decline continued after a pause. Gold shorts fell sharply by as much as four jiao due to the large-scale dumping of No. 69 bonds. The total transaction amount for the day was 19.96 million yuan. The comparative table of the highest and lowest results is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>New York Stock Prices Rise</p>
<p>According to a report from Newffong &amp; Co., yesterday (the 5th), New York stock market prices rose gradually due to strong investment demand.

Stocks on the small exchange advanced under the leadership of utility stocks. The total trading volume for the day was 880,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e236">Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Yarn Prices Fall, Standard Yarn Softens Again <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation showed a dim outlook. This was because the Tianjin merchants, who had been actively buying for several days, suddenly stopped purchasing yesterday. The selling price of Japanese yarn fell by one yuan, and market sentiment relaxed, with many closing out their long positions.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Closes Out Long Positions</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, prices for all months showed signs of softening. Due to poor foreign cotton and sluggish demand from the north for Japanese yarn transactions, short selling activities and long position liquidations increased. It was also rumored that there would be deliveries of 20-count Fugui yarn, which further weakened sentiment. As a result, prices for all months fell by six, seven, and eight jiao to one yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation remained normal at the opening of the afternoon session. Buyers were not active, and market transactions were sluggish. Most people still had a bearish outlook. However, there has been a significant number of spot sales recently, and the factory's inventory has eased. As a result, prices for all months fell again by one, two, and three jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 350 bales of Dafu, 1,200 bales of Ruidda, 450 bales of Hengde, 1,300 bales of Changfeng, 700 bales of Xiacheng, 550 bales of Xincheng, 300 bales of Senkang, and 300 bales of Taichang were sold. 300 bales of Jifeng, 450 bales of Tongfu, 350 bales of Changji, 1,100 bales of Shenji, 1,300 bales of Yichang, and 400 bales of Jinchang were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Bales of Sino-Japanese Yarn Transacted</p>
<p>Spot sales were slightly clearer, with various merchants buying 760 bales. The market price was flat. Over 300 bales of Japanese yarn were transacted, with prices falling by five jiao to one and a half yuan. The purchase amounts of various merchants are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 505   Changsha: 130   Nanjing: 10</p>
<p>Yunnan: 40   Inland: 35   Wuhu: 10</p>

<p>Bulls Spit Out Before Noon, Re-Enter in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The cotton market, which had been rising for several days, suddenly rebounded yesterday. On the bull side, there was a slight spit out and decline in the morning, but there were signs of buying again in the afternoon. The current market situation is extremely complex, rising and falling suddenly, with uneven fluctuations.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Falls Back Three Jiao</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market, near-term rebounds suddenly occurred. Also, the US cotton, which had been rising for several days, suddenly fell more than twenty pounds in telegrams. Long positions were liquidated, and selling pressure rose slightly. However, the standard gold price returned to over ten yuan. As a result, near-term fell by three and a half to four jiao, and far-term fell by two and a half jiao. At the opening of the afternoon session, the trend of old cotton was still stable. It is said that the bulls came to buy again, and in these few days, Japanese merchants bought spot cotton quite vigorously. Therefore, the bulls stabilized. As a result, the near-term rose by five cents to one jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the far-term rose by five cents. It was found that 1,300 dan of Suilong, 1,300 dan of Jinchang, 1,400 dan of Gengfeng, 2,200 dan of Ruidda, 1,400 dan of Shenfei, 1,300 dan of Changfeng, 5,400 dan of Runkang, 1,000 dan of Xiacheng, 5,700 dan of Xincheng, and 5,300 dan of Changhe were sold. 1,600 dan of Jifeng, 3,500 dan of Tongfu, 1,000 dan of Daji, 1,200 dan of Yuanda, 1,200 dan of Zhengda, 2,100 dan of Taixing, 1,500 dan of Yichang, 1,400 dan of Shengyuan, 1,100 dan of Yikang, 4,700 dan of Yuanxingchang, 1,000 dan of Yifeng, 1,100 dan of Changfeng, and 2,100 dan of Gehe were bought.

<p>Cotton Sales Turn Sluggish Again</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption has turned sluggish again. Japanese factories have stopped purchasing. The source of supply is estimated to be 1,400 bales of Yao cotton and 930 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>

<p>US Cotton Suddenly Sees a Significant Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the US cotton market, due to bad news from Liverpool and good weather on the previous day, long positions were liquidated and foreign merchants sold, causing prices for all months to fall by seven to twenty-six points. Subsequently, it recovered due to the firm rise in the stock market. However, as soon as it rose slightly, people sold, and the market turned sluggish, as if waiting for developments in Washington and cotton field reports. Finally, it fell again due to spot traders and brokers selling, long positions being liquidated, and the weakness of the wheat market. At the final close, there was a slight short covering. Spot demand was sluggish, while textiles were more active. Hester estimated that factory usage this week would be 214,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory would be 225,000 bales. It is estimated that spot prices fell by 25 points, and futures prices fell by 20 to 28 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 1 to 5 points. Indian cotton initially firmed due to futures traders buying, but then weakened due to bad news from Liverpool and long positions being liquidated. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 0.25 to 1.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1 to 1.5 rupees. The original telegram recording is on the left (5th telegram):</p>

<h3 id="e238">Grain Merchants Have Different Views on the Wheat Industry <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market remained stable after opening in the morning and afternoon for each month. Although foreign wheat saw a sharp drop, the market sentiment was not very attentive. This is because the current foreign wheat orders, in addition to factories, are regarded with caution by merchants due to ongoing domestic monetary issues. Therefore, although the price is cheap, it cannot shake the minds of those in the industry. Therefore, the bids for each month were stable, but transactions were not smooth. The large drop in foreign wheat held it back. As a result, the current month fell by a small amount, August was unchanged, and September and October were up by a small amount. The spot wheat market remains supported. Because factories have fixed foreign wheat, they are uniformly not buying cart wheat. According to industry speculation, there may need to be a slight price reduction before they are interested in buying. Ship wheat transactions are also few, only 500 bales of Kunshan wheat opened, priced at three yuan, three jiao, and eight fen, which was purchased by Xin Da.</p>
<p>US Wheat and Canadian Wheat: The situation is chaotic, shrouding everything. There is a lack of speculators in the market, so there are drastic changes whenever there is unusual news. It is heard that the supply price of unfixed orders is at the lowest level. The weather is now improving. Once the market sentiment calms down, the weather problem will probably still be the biggest force driving the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market had become stable in each month. Foreign wheat quotations: Chicago fell by a huge 1 yuan and 56 jiao, and Canada fell by 1 yuan and 4 jiao. However, market sentiment had anticipated the fall in foreign wheat prices the day before. Therefore, after the opening quotation, market sentiment rebounded. The factory's hedging orders had already been issued in large quantities the day before, and there were very few remaining. A part of the buyers continued to buy one after another. Therefore, although the turnover was only over 200,000, the market was slightly better by half a point. At the opening of the afternoon session, spot wheat bids were relatively high, with rumors that the bid was five jiao zero, so the market stabilized. Then, the factory resurfaced, and the stability was slightly weak. After observing the subsequent steps, it is difficult to expect a good market for flour due to the unlimitable dumping of foreign wheat. As a result, the current month was better by 2.5 li, August was slightly worse by 2.5 li, September was unchanged, October was better by 7.5 li, and November and December were better by 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Upstream Merchants Actively Purchase Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, only the 15th and 16th numbers (a total of over 3,000 shi) arrived in Shanghai South, coupled with cloudy weather, market sentiment was quite stable. The sales area in this street was actively moving, and the Qingdao merchants also handled 400 packets. Therefore, the market color was slightly attractive. The market prices of each thick japonica rice and thin indica rice rose by a few cents to jiao, and looking at the subsequent trend, if the cloudy weather turned to rain, there seemed to be hope. The change in yin set the Yuan stability situation, with no honor or disgrace to the Du Jian. Shanghai North and the lower reaches each had 14th and 15th number sources. In the market sales, white japonica rice slightly softened, and the price form was stable. Thin indica rice and early indica rice were still acceptable, and their prices were stable. White Yuan was sluggish and wooden, and the price form was becoming more downstream every day. The remaining goods also saw a peaceful situation.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market situation was active due to the customer base. In particular, the area along the Yangtze River, such as Jiujiang, Hankou, and Nanjing, had a more greedy appetite. Ningbo merchants also inquired. Although the volume of purchases in this street and inland areas declined slightly, the customer base was more lively, and transactions were still strong. A total of 8,000 packets of Saigon and about 2,000 packets each of small twisted Siamese rice were opened. The market seemed to be thriving.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Spot Soybean Cakes are Extremely Scarce at Local Factories <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market situation was relatively quiet due to the possibility of rain. However, the market price was still firm and stable. The actual reason was that each factory was lacking spot goods. It was heard that the shipping dates written on the stack slips have been arranged until around the end of the month, so market sentiment was still good. Factories are afraid of not being able to meet demand. Therefore, they put up prices in the market to buy in, so spot cake market prices were relatively firm. The market for customer cakes that could be presented was still stable, and its future delivery trend seemed to turn soft. It is estimated that the total market has 1,000 pieces of Shahe edged cake, and another 1,000 pieces of road cargo bright edged cake, 1,500 pieces of road cargo Dalian edged cake, and another 500 pieces of bright edged cake, 500 pieces of Niuzhuang black soybean cake, and 15,000 pieces of Four Brand factory cake from each factory, and 500 pieces of Five Brand cake were purchased, including the factory's purchases.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was extremely quiet because there was no loading today, which is Sunday. Therefore, even though the Customs Gold Unit rebounded, there was no turnaround. At the Chamber of Commerce's drawing board, No. 24 coarse raw sugar was called at 16 yuan for spot goods, and re-export goods were called at 4 yuan and 8 jiao, but there were no transactions. Taikoo sugar and local factory refined white sugar did not change. There were a few openings in the number board. It is estimated that the Chaozhou merchants exchanged dozens of packets of high Huanggang Qing at 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 1.5 points, and the Lian merchants exchanged over 70 packets of ordinary Quanzhou red at 10 yuan.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Not Many High-Quality Lan Bamboo Branches</p>
<p>The two batches of Lan bamboo branches that arrived from Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship the day before, including the early red branches, totaled only about 60 boxes. The samples were seen yesterday, and the opening price of high-quality goods was up or down by one or two yuan compared to the first board, and there was not much change for ordinary goods. Early red branches also need to lose two or three yuan.</p>

<p>Actual sales of lead are exceptionally few. The Tianjin and Hankou gangs are currently facing tight credit, chaotic times, or major flooding. Therefore, there is very little activity. Only a few businesses like paint companies, red lead factories, and printing houses buying type are conducting minimal transactions. The situation is similar to the end of winter. The standard price per dan is estimated at fourteen yuan. However, in the hidden market, it can be bought for thirteen yuan and fifty to seventy-five cents. However, those holding goods are unwilling to sell cheaply on the surface because their cost is above fourteen yuan. If there are large transactions and cash sales, the price can be appropriately discounted. It is said that sixty to seventy dan were traded yesterday, purchased by retail customers in the market.</p>
<p>Piece Goods - A Review of the Wool Fabric Market in the Last Half Year</p>
<p>Since 1934, sales of wool fabrics have gradually decreased among various dealers. This year, the decline is even more pronounced, with prices falling in eighty to ninety percent of sales. The market situation of the past six months is briefly described below:</p>
<p>(January) The weather should be cold but is not, and sales of overcoats and the like are stagnant. Herringbone wool flannel is increasing later and later. One〇〇Five riding breeches in colors eighteen and twenty-four are also trending upward due to the warm weather. (February) The Lunar New Year opened with red prices. Due to current events, seventy to eighty percent were cheaper than in January. However, the opening prices were standardized, eliminating the bad habit of pricing and bargaining, and transactions were still possible. (March) Various retail shops and customer groups in this street made large purchases of plain broadcloth, Yuanzhi tribute cloth, gabardine, flannel, suit cloth, heavy broadcloth, Hanning cloth, floral cotton cloth, feather yarn, and single-sided open water Mei, etc. Sales were good. Prices of goods such as two types of straight tribute broadcloth fell due to the increased import of Japanese goods. (April) Goods for summer sales have successively entered the market for trading, but the market price is cheaper than in March. Although it is said that the interest rate has been extended first, it is also due to the tight credit. (May) Spring sales have ended, and summer sales are limited. The price of goods continues to decline. The downward trend of Poplin and Valeding is even more severe due to the influx of arrivals. Money lenders are cautious with loans, and the wool fabric industry holds the belief that "it is better to receive eight hundred in cash than to offer one thousand on credit," and the market situation is even worse. (June) Except for summer white goods such as white broadcloth, white tribute cloth, Poplin, yellow twill, gauze twill cloth, and ramie glue cloth, few other products have a way out. The following is a table listing the monthly standard price fluctuations:</p>

<p>After the establishment of the Flannelette Guild at the end of last month, the first executive committee decided on this year's new price, including two jiao and five fen for single-sided corduroy, three jiao and five fen for double-sided corduroy, five jiao for double-sided Mia Flannelette, five jiao for double-sided white lining Flannelette, five jiao for double-sided thick flower Flannelette, plus one fen for insurance (all of the above are for 30 yards). The negotiated prices for special goods have been notified to all businesses in the city for uniform compliance.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Moderation and Equality <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>If we say that the Chinese have an inherent Chinese philosophy, then it is none other than the so-called doctrine of the Mean.</p>
<p>Thugs often work together to extort money; one plays the role of the tough guy and the other the good guy. In this way, it is neither too extreme nor too weak, allowing for both offense and defense. The tough guy can intimidate people, and the good guy can step down if things go wrong. Combining strength and gentleness is called the doctrine of the Mean, which is universally advantageous.</p>
<p>If a Chinese child's birth chart lacks fire, their parents will give them names like "炎" (Yan) or "燊" (Shen) to seek moderation. Some even say that smoking water pipes is the most hygienic for Chinese people because water and fire balance each other, causing no harm to the lungs! Chinese people eating rice is also better than foreigners eating bread because rice plants have their upper half exposed to the sun and their lower half immersed in water; these all conform to the doctrine of the Mean.</p>
<p>Therefore, some say that men being external and women being internal is moderation. This is making the most of their abilities, a reasonable division of labor, fair and equal, as can be proven by the theories of Confucius and the anonymous great thinkers of ancient China—the authors of the Book of Changes.</p>
<p>Equality, equality, has been shouted for several years, but it has all been in vain. Women had already achieved equality four or five thousand years ago!</p>
<p>Thus, equality is moderated, and the "equality" that women eagerly pursue has become a cursed name!</p>
<p>If such so-called moderation is fair, reasonable, and equal, then slave society should be the most intelligent society, and the slave system should be the most idealized and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Why? Because it is a reasonable division of labor and each makes the most of their abilities.</p>
<p>The master's soft hands are naturally suited to holding the whip, and slaves are born with inferior bones, naturally suited to exchanging labor. One commands, and the other labors—achieving moderation!</p>
<p>Today, most women are slaves to their families. They perform unpaid hard labor, they are bound by old and new etiquette, they have no political awareness, and it is impossible for them to obtain even the minimum level of cultural literacy. Life is hypocritical, bitter, laborious, and shameful. No heating, no other journeys, no awareness, the days pass by, just a continuous hardship. Yet, ah! In the eyes of the oppressors, this is fair and equal, this is a reasonable division of labor!</p>
<p>The so-called moderation that pretends to be reasonable, fair, and equal is the oppressor's blatant lie and the preaching to maintain the status quo. People who say this are trying to rationalize the oppression of the masses of women and nothing else.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Section 2: The Disintegration of the Family and Women <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution since the eighteenth century has caused unprecedented changes to the entire social structure. These changes have had a particularly profound destructive impact on the traditional family life. That is to say, "large-scale industry has destroyed the previous family organization and the economic foundation of the corresponding family labor, while destroying the previous family relationships." In this way, capitalism transformed the traditional family and created a new lifestyle organization suitable for itself.</p>
<p>The capitalist transformation of the family, on the one hand, deprives the traditional family of its traditional duties, and on the other hand, reduces the sphere of influence of the family. As a result, the family's task in society has almost completely disappeared, and it only retains an empty shell. This is not a transformation, but "disintegration."</p>
<p>We know that in the feudal era, the family was the economic production unit of society, the basic cell organization of the country, and even the collective of cultural education. Therefore, the family ties were very close. However, after the Industrial Revolution, with the development of the capitalist economic organization, the family's production tasks were shrinking day by day, and family members inevitably joined the social production relations. In this way, the family has no meaning to exist except for sex life and consumption purposes.</p>
<p>However, in the process of this family collapse, two different groups of women were liberated from the family towards two different futures, namely, women from wealthy families and working women.</p>
<p>In the era of commercial capitalism, there was still a certain amount of division of labor between men and women in the families of the rich. In addition to the function of consumers, housewives could also perform various tasks in household management. However, in the second half of the nineteenth century, with the development of social organizations and technology, the tasks of housewives in the family were greatly reduced. From sewing, weaving to making cakes, etc., the work that housewives used to undertake was completely transferred to entrepreneurs. Even the task of educating children has been transferred to specialists or social organizations. Her task is only to have children and spend the money her husband earns. In this way, idle women are liberated from family chores and spend their days in decadent lives such as dressing up, watching dramas, chatting, and dancing. The French civil rights advocate Jules Hyde described the modern idle family as follows:</p>
<p>"Among people who are 'born with a silver spoon in their mouths,' things that can usually be done among family members are done by hiring people outside the family to do them with money. Female hired workers outside the family - nannies breastfeed children, and other nannies dress, wash, and feed the children, and even help them walk. There are also family tutors outside the family who bear the education of the children. … In this way, the families of the rich now only retain the shape of life, at most a vault."</p>
<p>In this way, women in rich families are liberated from trivial housework and live a decadent life, but working women are completely opposite. In fact, they are not liberated from the family, but the environment forces them to leave the family. Because the husband's income is not enough to support his wife and children, they have to sell cheap labor in order to survive.</p>
<p>Women who leave their families to go to factories have to leave their children to the education of the streets or the supervision of neighbors. They spend their days in the factory in tired lives, and they have completely lost the so-called "family orchestra." In their view, the family is nothing more than a common resting place for husband and wife. However, between the wife who is too tired and the husband who is nervous due to life pressure, let alone any mutual comfort, it is easy to get angry and scold each other. Their families do not even have the meaning of a "resting place."</p>
<p>In this way, women's labor is destroying the family system of capitalist society. But no matter how cruel the decline of the family is, the professionalization of women itself is a very progressive historical phenomenon. Why? Because only women's labor that destroys this family can create a new form of family and marriage relationship. Let's look at the following teaching again.</p>
<p>"No matter how terrible and disgusting the collapse of the old family relationship under the capitalist system is manifested, large-scale industry gives women, male and female minors, and young children positive tasks in the socially organized production process, that is, outside the family, thereby creating a new economic foundation, and at the same time creating the highest form of family and gender relations."</p>
<h3 id="e246">Victims in Rumors <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Tie</p>
<p>In the midst of the rising tide of restoration and the mutual reflection of moral policies of gender distinction in northern and southern cities - Beiping advocated the separation of boys and girls in schools, Guangzhou restricted female teahouse workers - a small storm of gender issues was also set off in a primary school in Hangzhou City in the Yangtze River Basin. Although the storm was small, it had a great impact on the status of women. I will report what I have heard to the women's world.</p>
<p>Women are ultimately women in a male-centered society. In a primary school garden cultivated by more than twenty gardeners - teachers, female gardeners only occupy six positions. Although they work equally hard, at the end of this semester, an unexpected blow came. In addition to the two married women, it is said that each of the other four Misses has fallen in love with a male colleague; and one of them is even in love with the head of the school. Love between men and women is inevitable. As long as people are in the present era, as long as they have a slightly clearer mind, no one will deny that love between male and female colleagues cannot be a reason for being dismissed. As a result, three Misses were dismissed, but their lovers in the rumors remained unmoved; the other couple was also together, and only this couple was not a rumor but a fact. It is said that the reason why the school did this was entirely the intention of the supreme principal.</p>
<p>The facts of the process and handling are like this, which is a portrayal of the status of women in a male-centered society. Otherwise, why must women be sacrificed to clear up rumors?</p>

<h3 id="e247">After Reading the Inaugural Issue of "Women's Life" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Jenny</p>
<p>For the sake of life, for the sake of being an independent person, I left this noisy but very stimulating Shanghai and went to ×× Town in Sichuan Province to be a poor teacher. After a year of hard work, I only had ten silver dollars in my pocket on the way back. With a great desire for knowledge, I like to read books, especially books and newspapers about women. Thanks to the introduction of "Women's World", I knew that a "Women's Life" monthly magazine would be published soon. One afternoon, I went to Shanghai and rushed to the magazine company on Sima Road in the evening to look for it - Women's Life. Knowing that pre-ordering is cheaper than buying it at retail, I happily cut two of the ten silver dollars. They returned four small sheep to me, and I took "Women's Life" and went home happily.</p>
<p>"Under the heavy oppression of internal and external troubles, 'How should we be human?' I also wonder, hoping for an answer. "Women's Life" is said to be the answer to this question. They said in the inaugural issue: "She will be your confidante, give you a lot of wisdom, so that you know yourself, know others, know the world, know all the ugliness. She will be your guide, give you a lot of guidance, so that you know how to get rid of the heavy pressure, how to be a person, how to be a social person! How to join hands and embark on the bright road." I believe that from now on, I have a confidante and a guide. After the joy, I quickly read on. The three short comments are comments on recent women's current affairs. The author correctly explained each problem in a light and simple tone. After the short comments is the special article. The first article is Mr. Jin Zhonghua's "To Chinese Women at the Present Stage." In this difficult time to speak, Mr. Jin cleverly said the current tasks of the women's movement. People who are enthusiastic about the women's movement must read it. The second is Mr. Zhang Xichen's "The Division of Labor of Women." "Women returning to the family" is a very fashionable slogan. Mr. Zhang used the theory of division of labor to attack this fashionable theory. He said: "The division of labor is the greatest principle of social evolution. It is the same for men and women. All efforts that violate this principle are ultimately in vain in the history of social evolution." This gives a great answer to those who advocate the "women returning home" theory. Then there is Mr. Cao Juren's "Coeducation of Men and Women," which I read and felt humorous and painful, making me want to cry. Ibsen's "Nora" had already arrived in China in the May Fourth era, but with the sound of "women returning home," the "Chinese Nora" who had left home mostly went home obediently, so Ibsen's "Nora" was reintroduced, which is still necessary; Mr. Bi Yao's "Three States of Nora" not only fulfilled this task, but also pointed out the "Chinese Nora" that everyone is now idealizing is definitely not the Nora of Ibsen's era. "She will not only resist her husband's inequality towards his wife, but will resist all unequal phenomena in the world. She will not only seek personal liberation, but will seek the liberation of society and mankind." I have read a lot of Mr. Bi Yao's articles, and I think this one is the most outstanding. The top of the article "Should Women Return Home?" has a child dancing and dragging the "head flower" of a woman wearing high-heeled leather shoes. This head flower aroused my special interest. I finished reading the main text in one breath, and then turned back to the author to find out that it was the great work of Mr. Wang Xiaoying, a veteran of the women's movement in the May Fourth era. Many heroines of the May Fourth era have now hid in high-rise buildings, but Mr. Wang is participating in the new team to oppose restoration, which makes me feel respectful. Everyone can write articles, and each has different skills. Regarding the issue of married women taking their husband's surname, it has been discussed in the newspaper before. Mr. Mu Hui borrowed Pearl Buck's remarriage to discuss the issue of women's surnames, which can be regarded as making the most of the topic, especially the humorous and relaxed text, which will make the wives who wear the hat of their husband's surname feel "What is love?". Jun Hui, my lecturer, I listened to your lectures every week in the women's garden without interruption, but we two never had the chance to meet! It's a real regret. Your "Modern Marriage and Divorce" is just like the lectures in the women's garden and the essays in the female voice, which explains the ugliness of modern marriage in a well-founded manner, and is also an anatomical chart of the corpse of the current society.</p>
<p>Journey fatigue and knowledge sorrow, in full formation, are waging war on my mind and body. Finally, the demon of journey fatigue won, and it captured my eyes, and it seemed that I could no longer read. I closed the book, and I couldn't bear to let go of the green and lovely cover, so I naturally looked at the table of contents again. Here I suddenly discovered a miracle. The signature below the casual talk about the female pilgrims in West Lake is Yunyi. Yunyi? My primary school teacher, isn't she called "× Yunyi"? I turned over the book again. Protect the article. Prove that it must be the teacher's handwriting. Teacher, do you also remember your naughty Jenny? Your article is really good. It not only delicately describes the strange female pilgrims in West Lake, but also answers the entire women's superstition. It gave me a lot of knowledge.</p>
<p>I got up early the next day and read Women's Life. I couldn't wait to swallow everything into my stomach.</p>
<p>I started reading the lectures on social science. The first lecture on the philosophical basis of social science was given by Mr. Shen Zhiyuan. The fluency of the writing and the simplicity of the wording made me read it like reading a novel. There is absolutely no general philosophical book that is so difficult to read and understand. Mr. Sun Yucai's "Women and War" gave a simple and clear report on the entire imperialist camp, explaining the inevitable coming of the world war. In this eve of the storm, will women participate in this cruel war? Pray for peace? Neither is true. He has a more in-depth explanation; the story is long, and the readers will each go and read the article. In short, if you want to understand the current affairs and understand the tasks of women in the future, you must read this article. Mr. Ren Yuan's "The Life of Modern Turkish Women" explains the liberation facts of various Turkish women. At the same time, he still said that although this is the case, she is still not completely liberated. How can she be completely liberated? Please ask the reader to find it in the article. What is the life of the peasant women in our neighboring country, which is full of energy? You can read Mr. Xueying's article. Mr. Mao Dun's "The Work of the First Half Day" vividly portrays the inner world of a woman who has just entered the workplace. The white description of me writing its movement is the preface to her long novel "Tragic Life." Then there is the fresh "Movie Novel "Boatman Girl"", which is interesting with words and pictures. I hope there will be such an article in each issue in the future. There are primary school teachers, university students, abandoned women, stars, and rural working women on the "Survival Line." They asked to struggle on this survival line. It can be read as a novel or as a social aspect. The rest of the lectures on physiology and hygiene and scientific anecdotes are all simple and interesting. In short, it gave me considerable satisfaction. At the same time, I also gave some criticisms very impolitely. First, the printing is bad, second, the text is not very popular, and third, the material selection is too serious. These are the dissatisfactions I felt after reading it. I hope to improve them as soon as possible, as the editor said, "to make it a popular reading material."</p>
<h3 id="e248">A Letter from a Person Who Cannot Find a Way Out <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yuan</p>
<p>Under the strict authority of the old etiquette, women can only submit and only endure silently. There is no way to resist the so-called "lifelong event" of marriage! In this time when there is no way to go, I want to study to make a living, so I discussed with my mother and grandmother to go to the city to study. They both loved me very much and of course agreed to my request. At that time, I was fortunate that my father was not at home. If he was at home, there would be no hope. He is a follower of the "a woman without talent is a virtue" ideology!</p>
<p>When I went home for winter vacation after studying in the city for a year, my sister-in-law quietly told me, "Auntie, you can't study anymore next year. I heard that the man's family has decided to marry you back next autumn!" This was a bolt from the blue, and I couldn't help but tremble all over. At that time, my father had already returned. I mustered up my courage and asked a cousin indirectly to say to my mother, "I will not get married no matter what next year. I want to study for a few more years. If you don't listen to me, I will have to commit suicide." My mother was also very worried, so she told my father. What about my father? My father, who has always been pampered in a male-centered society, will never understand this pain. He only felt that the woman's unwillingness to submit was unreasonable. Therefore, after hearing my mother's words, he scolded my mother, "Studying, studying has made people bad. You shouldn't have agreed to her to study! Who has ever heard of a woman daring to oppose marriage? You are not allowed to study again next year!" From then on, I lost even the glimmer of hope for studying!</p>
<p>In this society that kills without bloodshed, my freedom of marriage was swallowed up by cruel tyranny, and my actions were strictly controlled. In the second year, I married that stranger like a tame sheep!</p>
<p>Leaving the family I had depended on for more than ten years, as well as my dear parents, sisters, and brothers, suddenly changing to an unfamiliar environment, anyone would feel strange and painful, let alone add all kinds of etiquette oppression. Daily life is really like a mute eating Coptis chinensis.</p>
<p>I was spoiled by my grandmother since I was a child, and I can't carry burdens or farm, so I'm afraid that my parents-in-law will be dissatisfied, and I'm also afraid of the discord between my sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law. I also have to worry about the criticism of the villagers. None of these things fail to make me worried and cautious every step of the way.</p>
<p>In this restrained life, not only is there no one with whom I can talk to who has the same interests, but not even my husband. In our feudal village, women are not allowed to talk to their husbands during the day, and they have to hide quickly when they meet, otherwise, they will be scolded as "a woman who is strange and beautiful," and your parents-in-law will be unhappy.</p>
<p>As for the neighbors in the village who see the newcomers, they either tease or criticize. In short, they try to make you unhappy. In this environment, in addition to cooking, washing clothes, feeding pigs, and feeding chickens every day, I can only sit alone in the room and do needlework for my little sisters and brothers. Such days probably lasted for more than half a year. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e249">The Devaluation of the Belgian Currency and the Gold Standard Bloc <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Qi</p>
<p>The gold standard system can be said to be a characteristic of capitalism. Advanced capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Germany originally operated under the gold standard. However, since the outbreak of the world economic panic in 1929, prices have fallen daily, production has declined accordingly, and the foreign trade of various capitalist countries has shown an increasing decline. Under these circumstances, some capitalist countries, in order to raise prices, stimulate production, reduce foreign exchange rates, and increase exports, had no choice but to tear off their masks of prosperity and abandon the gold standard. Consequently, countries like Britain and the United States took the lead in devaluing their currencies and abandoning the gold standard, initiating a fierce currency war. This currency war is not only closely related to the economic and political situation of countries that have abandoned the gold standard, but also has a significant impact on those still maintaining it. It is evident that one of the main reasons why Japanese goods have been able to spread all over the world and the economies of Britain and the United States have relatively improved is their devaluation of currencies and abandonment of the gold standard, resulting in lower foreign exchange rates. However, countries maintaining the gold standard have encountered many obstacles in international trade. In fact, the French franc has already shown a state of near unsustainability under the continuous assault of the low-priced pound sterling and US dollar. Therefore, European countries maintaining the gold standard, led by France, such as Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, joined forces at the London World Economic Conference in July 1933 to rescue their domestic economies, unanimously advocating the maintenance of the gold standard and forming the Gold Standard Bloc. Subsequently, they held another meeting in September of the same year, deciding to establish a committee to take charge. On October 19, 1934, Poland also joined, holding a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss everything. Thus, we can say that the so-called Gold Standard Bloc is a united front formed by France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Luxembourg against countries that have abandoned the gold standard, such as Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>However, the unity of the so-called Gold Standard Bloc is not very solid. Among them, Italy, although superficially maintaining the gold standard, can be said to have already suspended it under its actual controlled economy. As for Belgium, it has always relied on French assistance to maintain its fate between the two major powers, Germany and France. During the last World War, it suffered German devastation, and its domestic economy was almost in a state of despair for a time. Later, due to gaining many benefits in the Treaty of Versailles, with the help of the French and its own efforts, it gradually recovered and maintained its gold standard. However, in the raging torrent of the world economic panic, Belgium's economic crisis also deepened daily. Although it benefited from mutual support with gold standard countries after the formation of the Gold Standard Bloc, countries such as Britain, the United States, and Japan continued to devalue their currencies and vigorously dump their goods all over the world. Gold standard countries were increasingly placed in an unfavorable situation in exchange transactions and international trade. As a result, Belgium, which was struggling to maintain the gold standard, clearly demonstrated a tremendous economic, financial, and even political crisis.</p>
<p>The Gold Standard Bloc continues to exist with France's efforts to support it; Belgium's gold standard certainly cannot be maintained independently without French assistance. However, as the world economic panic continues to develop, as the US dollar, the pound sterling, and the Japanese yen continue to depreciate, and as Germany actively makes various expressions abroad, France's own economy, finances, and politics are deteriorating daily. The fate of the French franc can be said to be in extreme danger. The recent political instability in France and the continuous change of cabinets are concrete manifestations of this situation. Therefore, when a major financial crisis occurred in Belgium and the Belgian currency was extremely chaotic, former Prime Minister Renkin went to Paris to appeal for help, earnestly requesting France to provide 4 billion French francs in assistance to alleviate its financial difficulties and maintain its parity. However, the result was nothing more than an empty declaration that "the Belgian currency has been saved, and Belgium will continue to adhere to the gold standard," without any actual assistance. Consequently, Renkin issued an emergency order for exchange control after returning to his country and then resigned. Thereupon, the head of the banking community, Janson, came to power with the so-called unanimous support of the nation in order to implement a strong policy.</p>
<p>After the Janson cabinet was formed, it passed the currency dictatorship bill in both houses of parliament. Its main content was to suspend gold convertibility, reduce the gold parity of the Belgian franc by 28 percent, and rely on a new economic recovery plan to resolve its economic crisis. Janson said: "The previous cabinet's request for French assistance ultimately failed, and the financial crisis has worsened. The only remedy now is to separate the Belgian franc from gold and devalue it. The Belgian franc will not maintain a strict link with gold parity for the time being. ... Roosevelt's recovery policy is commendable, but the labor policy based on shortening working hours and its currency policy should be opposed. The United States does not need to lower its parity. If the United States has a definite economic policy, it can overcome the world's recession. We have now made a mistake on the front line, so to rescue the Belgian franc, we can only retreat to the second line. ..." Since then, Belgium has resolutely implemented the policy of abandoning the gold standard and lowering its parity.</p>
<p>Belgium is a major player in the Gold Standard Bloc. Its implementation of currency devaluation and abandonment of the gold standard will inevitably lead to major changes in its relationship with other countries in the Gold Standard Bloc, even to the point of antagonism with these countries. From the current situation, the Belgian franc may be approaching the pound sterling, further complicating the European economic situation and even disintegrating the Gold Standard Bloc.</p>
<p>France is the leader of the Gold Standard Bloc. Belgium's currency devaluation has greatly shaken the entire Gold Standard Bloc's front line, which is undoubtedly a major blow to France. In recent months, France's financial difficulties and the crisis of the French franc can be said to have reached their peak. Although the Laval cabinet has passed the financial plenary powers bill in parliament, implementing dictatorial measures to curb speculation and maintain the French franc, experts speculate that its prospects are still not optimistic. Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the Belgian currency is about to be devalued again. Although this rumor has been denied by the Belgian authorities, considering that Belgium's budget deficit for this year is over 400 million Belgian francs, the realization of another devaluation of the Belgian currency is not entirely impossible. If the Belgian franc is indeed devalued again, France, which has the closest relationship with Belgium, will inevitably suffer a greater blow economically. In addition, gold standard countries such as the Netherlands and Switzerland will also inevitably be greatly affected. In this way, the collapse of the Gold Standard Bloc can be said to be unavoidable, and the only difference is the matter of time.</p>

<p>Jinan, an ancient city. It was originally a "prefecture" and also Licheng County - "Brother Qin the Second", who lived in Licheng County, Shandong, was a product of this place.</p>
<p>It is the capital of Shandong Province, and besides Qingdao, it is the most prosperous in Shandong. At the same time, taking the entire North China region, although it cannot compare with Beijing and Tianjin, it can always be ranked closely behind them. Because it has modern means of transportation as its pulse: the Jiaoji Railway runs from Qingdao to here, about a twelve-hour journey; at the same time, the Jinpu Railway runs through it vertically, which is the center of the north and south. Therefore, although Jinan is an ancient city, it is soaked in the juice of capitalism: there are modern buildings (tall Western-style buildings, wide asphalt roads), and most of the goods in the shops are machine-made. In short, it has changed its original appearance, step by step moving towards a new path.</p>
<p>However, the customs and habits here are still very old-fashioned; the atmosphere of the so-called "old moral teachings" is more intense than in any city in the south. For example, men and women walking hand in hand on the street can be said to be very common; not only is it not uncommon in major cities in the south, but it is also not surprising in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao. But in Jinan, it becomes a problem; not only will the police intervene, but even bystanders will laugh. Therefore, in such a large city as Jinan, it is rare to find young men and women walking hand in hand, and it is rare to see men and women together at all.</p>
<p>Jinan's customs and habits are so old-fashioned, partly because Shandong promotes the preservation of ancient customs, and at the same time it is close to the hometown of the "sage," and it has been greatly influenced by the "moralizing influence" of the "sage." People probably haven't</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>forgotten: the "story" of "searching for her husband for thousands of miles," which spread throughout the country in March and April of this year, happened here. If it weren't for the promotion of Shandong and the local people supporting it, I don't think the names of Han Guiqing and Sun Defu would have been firmly remembered by me! (Unfortunately, Han Guiqing is not "Meng Jiangnu" after all? Sun Defu is not "Wan Qiliang" either, which is inevitably a regrettable thing)</p>
<p>Not long ago, the "scandalous family tragedy" occurred, which shocked the entire city of Jinan, and the social situation changed as a result. Whether in tea houses, restaurants, streets, or alleys, this matter was taken as a topic of conversation, and the local newspapers recorded the progress of the tragedy and the actions of the protagonists in the tragedy every day with headline titles. Most civil servants were generally on edge, fearing that their wives would also be taken away by others, so some requested the government to guarantee their families, some requested the strict arrest of "wife-snatching thief" Wang Chongfan, and the arrest of "abandoning her husband and children" and "eloping" Wang Zhixian. At the same time, most expressed sympathy and condolences to Zhou Yanguang. As for the general public opinion of society, it was even more scolding "adulterers" and "harlots"! Such things may be found every day in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, but they are not so sensational. From this, it can be seen that Jinan's customs and habits are still shrouded in feudal consciousness.</p>
<p>However, old-fashioned customs and habits do not diminish my love for Jinan. Because the atmosphere of lewdness here is relatively thin, and the pressure of material things is relatively light. People like us who suffer in big cities really can't feel its benefits, and only feel that it is a man-eating beast, a demon that torments people. However, after running to Jinan, I feel that I have relieved a lot of pressure, and even breathing seems much easier. This is naturally not to say that you can absorb the air of freedom, but because the cost of living is low: in Shanghai, the minimum monthly food cost is ten yuan, but here it only costs four yuan. For example, pork costs forty cents a catty in Shanghai, but here it only costs twenty cents. In short, the necessities of life are relatively cheap. Living here can at least reduce half the burden.</p>
<p>In addition to the cheap cost of living, there are many scenic spots in Jinan that are available for play. People who have read "The Travels of Lao Can" must know that there is a "Daming Lake" in Jinan. Not far from the lake, there is still an old "Iron Duke's Temple," which may be a monument left to Lao Can by later generations (Lao Can's name is Tie Ying, and according to the travelogue, he did many "humanitarian" things for the people of Shandong). The lake surface is wide, and the lake water is clear and quiet. If you encounter a slight breeze, the clear lake water will stir up ripples, making people see it very lovely. The city's gentlemen and ladies mostly take this place as a playground, (either they) fish by the lake, or row boats on the lake, one side rowing, one side chatting and laughing, all the worries in the world are washed away by the lake water! Every Dragon Boat Festival, there are dragon boat races in the lake, and small boats are also very active, like dozens of dragonflies flying around on the water. In Jinan, Qianshan Mountain is comparable to Daming Lake. Not only are there images of "ancient Buddhas" and "revered gods" for viewing, but the terrain is high and open, quiet, and overlooking Daming Lake is like a mirror. In addition to these two famous attractions, there are also the four famous springs - Pearl Spring? Baotu Spring, Jinxi Spring, Black Tiger Spring, are all fun places. If it is in the summer, it is still a good place to cool off.</p>
<p>Speaking of Jinan's culture, it is naturally more developed in Shandong. In terms of schools, there is a normal school for boys (pre and post term), a high school, and a junior high school. In addition, there are also female normal schools and female high schools. Other cultural institutions include the Experimental Theater (focusing on new dramas, old dramas are also often performed, director Wang Bosheng), and the Public Education Center (focusing on acting, rural education). If it were not for the wrong direction, it can be said that the results are very good.</p>
<p>There are also several small publications here, the publication period is not fixed, because most of the organizers are young students, and sometimes they temporarily stop publication due to economic difficulties. The writers are mostly young students who are just learning to write, so the content is also very poor. As far as I know, there is "Youth Culture," which talks about half-baked social sciences. Others such as "Hua Di" (What), "First Line," are purely literary publications. There is also the supplement of the "Shandong Republican Daily," which is also a literary garden, and those who cultivate flowers and plants in this garden are mostly students from female normal schools and female high schools - the girls actually have such courage to seize a place in Jinan's literary world, and at the same time they have such sentiment to cultivate literary flowers and plants, which is also worth rejoicing and congratulating!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to mention the business aspect. The representative commercial areas here are "Shangbu" and "Guohuo Shangchang" (National Goods Commercial Field). The goods sold in Shangbu are mostly machine-made imported goods. These things occupy the entire market in Jinan and absorb the purchasing power of the people. As for the Guohuo Shangchang, it is relatively inferior and almost squeezed out of its existence by imported goods. At the same time, the so-called "Guohuo Shangchang" is also pitiful to say, except for the grass hats from this province and the porcelain from Boxian, which can attract some buyers, no one cares about the rest, and there are no goods to sell!</p>

<p>— Bo</p>
<p>Correspondence from Jiading</p>
<p>In order to survive, I have been living in the city for several years. Some people always think that people who go to the city to live must be going to enjoy themselves, but just thinking about myself, the hardships, oppression, and insults I have suffered in the past few years cannot be measured by vehicles or bushels.</p>
<p>However, everything in the countryside, the neat tiled houses, the honest and frugal villagers, and all the relaxed and leisurely atmosphere, I am very familiar with, although the walls of life have isolated me from all of this. Recently, in the city, I keep hearing news of the collapse of farmers' purchasing power, so every night I go to bed with restless nerves to imagine whether the tiled houses in my hometown are still as neat as before, and whether the villagers are still as amiable and comfortable as before.</p>
<p>Later, I finally got the opportunity to go back to visit all the characters in my hometown.</p>
<p>The first thing I felt unusual after returning home was that many lively and strong young people who had been living in the city had now stopped their businesses and returned home.</p>
<p>Our place, the whole town has nearly a thousand families, although most of them rely on cultivating mud to make a living, but because of the lack of farmland, if a family has two sons, one son must go outside to learn a craft or be an apprentice. Although learning a craft or being an apprentice does not necessarily lead to success, it only adds a few clowns who are kicked and beaten to the city, but looking at the fields that cannot produce gold, they have to go to the city to parasitize.</p>
<p>I used to hear people say that the bankruptcy of the countryside makes the city more dangerous. Now the city is also bankrupt. Many shops have closed down, and factories have closed down. Even if there is labor, there is nowhere to sell it. So this group of parasites who came from the countryside to the city have returned to the countryside again. The countryside is already unable to survive, and coupled with the surging gnawing of these young people returning from the city, the countryside will only collapse more quickly!</p>
<p>I met a few classmates from elementary school - these small businessmen, they were all crying and complaining about their difficult situation. They have developed a civilized appearance, but they cannot live a civilized life, and even old Maifan (villagers mix coarse wheat bran in their rice due to poverty) will not be able to import it. They are really trapped on the line between life and death.</p>
<p>This countryside is like a boat that has already been broken, and adding the weight of these vagrants, it is afraid that it will sink sooner or later.</p>
<p>The second thing worth mentioning is the tidbits in the sound of promoting the Baojia system in my hometown. In recent years, my hometown has followed the orders of the superiors to implement the Baojia system. First, start with the investigation of the household population, and then compile the Baojia. Ten households are one Jia, set up a Jia leader, ten Jia are one Bao, set up a Bao leader, and unite each Bao to set up a township head or town head. After several cumbersome procedures, it was finally completed in general. However, our people have never received group training. Once they are asked to take on the role of Jia leader or Bao leader, they will naturally make jokes that make people laugh. Once, the county magistrate personally went to the countryside to check the exam. At a certain Jia leader's place, he asked, "Do you know what a Jia leader does?" Seeing the official come to his humble house, the Jia leader was so frightened that he was almost dumbfounded and did not know what to answer. Then he said: "Make paper to cheat for food." The county magistrate and others laughed together. This Jia leader does rely on pasting paper to make a living. At another Jia leader's place, he asked: "Which families does your Jia include?" He replied: "Zhang Sanlang across the street, Huang Shuguan next door, and further down is the tofu shop, Li's Tavern, ..." It turned out that the area north of the tofu shop was no longer part of this Jia. At another Jia leader's place, he asked: "Which Bao and which Jia are you from?" The Jia leader opened his eyes wide and hurriedly said: "Let me go see the house number!"</p>
<p>According to the order of the department, all counties must run Bao leader training institutes, and all Bao leaders must attend the institute for training. If they do not attend, they will be subject to considerable punishment. The county magistrate then personally went to each township to persuade them. The level of knowledge of the Bao leaders varies greatly. The highest is a university professor and expert in Chinese studies, and the lowest is illiterate and does not know the north, south, east, and west. Because in poor and remote areas, most of them regard those with property as rural gentry, and therefore the rural gentry are pushed to be Bao leaders. The county magistrate said: "This time, no matter what, you must attend the Bao leader training. Some people think that I am an intellectual and do not need to be trained, but this is wrong. Bao leader × of × district in this county is a university professor. His knowledge and wisdom are even better than this county magistrate, but he also came to receive training in person. You should know that public affairs should be handled publicly. Fortunately, it only takes a dozen days, and the days are not long. As for the accommodation, diet, and hygiene, this county magistrate will definitely pay special attention to it."</p>
<p>In this way, with such vigorous action, after ten years, the people's wisdom will be improved, the people's organizational power will be cultivated, and the country's future may have some hope! However, in these ten years, will you be able to take your time and walk quietly? Thinking about it, I can't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e252">Critique of the National Language Romanization <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>China now needs a scientific, popular, and international phonetic writing system, which should be a common feeling among both the government and the public. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (1928), the University Council officially announced the National Language Romanization phonetic system in response to this need. However, after seven years, there are hardly any achievements. In terms of reading materials, only Zhao Yuanren's "The Last Five Minutes" and Li Jinxi's "A Chair" are seen. In terms of publications, only two issues of "Pudding" are available. The National Language Weekly occasionally provides a brief mention. This cannot but disappoint people with the National Language Romanization. Last year, a Latinized phonetic system emerged. Naturally, there are those who oppose it, treating it as foreign gibberish. However, Latinization is, after all, a symbol of Chinese people speaking for themselves. It has been established on the basis of convenience of use and a rational foundation. Language is inherently evolutionary. If we do not consider the successive evolutions from ancient script, oracle bone script, great seal script, small seal script, clerical script, regular script, running script, cursive script, and handwritten characters as inappropriate, then the evolution from "見, 溪, 羣, 疑" (archaic Chinese consonants) to "勺, 文, ," from the Matteo Ricci system to the Wade-Giles system to the National Language Romanization to Latinization should also be considered a natural trend. We cannot therefore despise the achievements of the creators of the National Language Romanization, and at the same time, we hope that these pioneers will follow objective facts, scientifically and without prejudice, to jointly complete the construction of the new writing system.</p>
<p>Only true facts can prove everything. Therefore, I would like to offer the readers fact after fact. I feel that the National Language Romanization is too artificial. For the sake of the principle that a character is a combination of initial, medial, and final sounds, it disregards the trouble of usage, ignores the living examples in living European and American languages, and adds a "y" vowel to J, Ch, sh, r, tz, ts, and s. Sometimes, it also feels that this superfluous method is a tumor, and under the cover of pleasant-sounding terms such as "neutral tone," simple forms without y, z, Sh, etc. appear.</p>
<p>The National Language Romanization is truly a national essence; it has the grandeur of five generations living under one roof. The families of ji, chi, shi are too large. In Northern Mandarin, most of them do not live that kind of life. If we remove the "List of Commonly Used Characters in National Language Romanization" and take a look, we can immediately discover that tz, ts, S are completely resting in at least fifteen vowels, while ji, chi, shi are suffering from overpopulation. Here, Latinization has a great innovation. It has led a contingent of people from the large families of ji, chi, shi in each vowel to develop the virgin land of tz, ts, shi, shi. This not only makes the writing system closer to the spoken language of the masses but also reduces the number of homophonous single characters with different meanings.</p>
<p>As soon as one mentions the National Language Romanization, the issue of the four tones comes to mind, which is a common feeling among everyone who knows a little about the National Language Romanization. The solution to the four-tone problem is the proudest achievement of the National Language Romanization scholars. They believe that with this, the number of homophonous characters with different meanings can be reduced, and it is precisely with this that they attempt to overwhelm Latinization. However, objectively speaking, unfortunately, the traces of the four tones penetrate the National Language Romanization, which is precisely the fatal flaw of the National Language Romanization. The four-tone needle injected into the blood vessels of the National Language Romanization is not purified blood that increases resistance; on the contrary, it is a toxin that will spread to the entire body of the National Language Romanization, from foot to head, and eventually lead to its demise. If the evidence we are about to present below is correct, then we can draw a conclusion two: The National Language Romanization will die at the hands of the four tones. Now, we can list how the four tones are corroding the National Language Romanization:</p>
<p>(A) In the spoken language of the northern provinces, everyone knows that different tunes are used. If for the sake of overall communication, characters within the same tone do not need to ask how they should be read in principle, just follow the National Language Romanization. However, that also won't work, because a bunch of characters that are in the same tone in Beijing will be divided into yin, yang, rising, and departing tones in other provinces. Who has the power to memorize the standard pronunciation table?</p>
<p>(B) The National Language Romanization melts the four tones into the character forms. Although there are only ten rules, learning them is really not easy. Here is an ironclad fact to prove it: In a Romanization training class lectured by Mr. Xiao Di Shen, only one out of twenty-odd university students graduated after two months.</p>
<p>(C) The usage of the same letters is not fixed. Sometimes they are used as initials or finals, and sometimes as markers for the four tones. Even people from Beijing find them difficult to remember and recognize.</p>
<p>Therefore, the National Language Romanization not only closes the door to the illiterate masses in China but also causes unfamiliar foreigners to hesitate due to its complexity. Is it internationalized?</p>
<p>Latinization does not use the four tones as a facade. It is attacked for this, and it also succeeds because of this. It does not circle around Chinese characters. It is based on spoken language and solves all problems in actual use. It wants to gradually evolve into a nationally unified national language from the various and inconsistent forms in different provinces. Therefore, the National Language Romanization is conservative, unchangeable, and narrow-minded, while Latinization is constantly changing towards rationality. It feels that "有" (yǒu, to have) should be separated from "由, 又" (yóu, yòu, from, again), so it specially created iou to distinguish it from iu. Similarly, it also uses uo for "說, 國, 火" (shuō, guó, huǒ, speak, country, fire) and gives the other uo finals a simpler and easier-to-distinguish form of 〇.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Other examples such as 他 (Ta, he), 她 (Taa, she), 買 (maai, buy), 賣 (mai, sell), 哪 (naai, which), 那 (na, that) are all scientific solutions. National Language Romanization scholars believe that this is treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, which will lead to endless troubles. It is better to formulate a set of four-tone markers for a once-and-for-all solution. In fact, we just want to treat the head when it hurts. We don't want to give medicine to the foot when the head hurts. We have no right to put shackles of the four tones on over a thousand characters because the above nineteen characters have problems, especially since the four tones do not have unified authority in Northern Mandarin. As for the endless troubles to come, that is worrying about the sky falling. Latinization is already being widely used. Tens of thousands of people are already reading Latinized newspapers and books and using Latinization to do many cultural things. No difficulties have been seen, and no endless troubles have been felt. The only examples that National Language Romanization scholars use to refute the drawbacks of Latinization without the four tones are just pears, lychees, plums, and chestnuts. Currently, the rules for writing compound words together fill the text with clearly defined words, making it easy to understand at a glance. A new and perfect new writing system is developing and growing.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to conclude with a sentence: Real gold is not afraid of fire. Let the National Language Romanization and Latinization be tested in the fire of the masses!</p>

<h3 id="e253">Tribute Peaches <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Carp</p>
<p>The most famous peaches in North China are the "Honey Peach" and "Wei Peach" from Shulu County and Shen County. In the Tianjin-Beijing area, they are almost household names, and everyone loves to eat them. Therefore, the price of peaches from these two counties sold in North China has risen with the expansion of people's appetites. Seeing that there is a profit to be made, general rural farmers have abandoned growing staple crops and have all gone to plant peach trees. However, although the "peach industry" in Donglu and Shen Counties has developed to the extreme, if compared with our Feicheng County's "peach industry," it is "far behind" in terms of both the quality of the peaches and the number of peach trees.</p>
<p>Feicheng is a small county in southern Shandong. Due to the underdevelopment of transportation, even if there are several special products, it is not easy to transport them to other places. Therefore, although the output of peaches is large here, there is no way for people in Tianjin-Beijing and south of the Yangtze River to enjoy this good taste. The special products produced here are "pheasants," "apricots," and "peaches." The first two are not well-known in other places, except for those who have been here and know their benefits. Only "peaches" are quite popular in the province, especially in Jinan. Anyone who has lived in Jinan for a year or two has probably eaten Feicheng peaches.</p>
<p>Feicheng seems to be naturally a place for growing peaches. Its soil fertility is beyond the reach of Shulu and Shen counties, which are known for their peach production. Therefore, most rural farmers replace agricultural production with peach growing. In the villages of the whole county, it can be said that there is no household that does not have hundreds of peach trees. As soon as you step into Feicheng County, it is like entering a peach garden, only seeing peach forests covering the sun and dense shade covering the ground. When the peach blossoms are in bloom, looking at the pink world all over the ground, you have an indescribable sense of beauty in your heart.</p>
<p>Among the villages in Feicheng, "Cao Zhuang" produces the most peaches and has the best taste. It can be said that even if you spend several hours, you still can't finish visiting the peach orchards there. Other villages also have peach orchards, but not as many peach trees. Villages with more peach trees are called "Zhuang," and those with fewer are called "Tao Xing." A "Zhuang" has at least several thousand peach trees; fewer than that are not qualified to be called "Zhuang." The number of trees in a "Tao Xing" ranges from over a thousand to several hundred, and at least over a hundred. They mostly use grafting to plant peach trees. The trunk of the tree is very small, and each tree is no more than six feet tall. The fertilizers used are mainly "stem cakes" (because "bean cakes" are not dry); secondly, they mostly use water to keep the soil moist. However, when the peach trees are in full bloom, they must stop watering, and what they pay the most attention to at this time is to press the roots of the trees tightly with soil to prevent the roots from being attacked by the wind. If they violate this principle, the peaches will wither before they are ripe. In addition, hurricanes and caterpillars are also the devil's hands that destroy peaches. When the peach blossoms are about to fall, if there is a hurricane, at least half of the peaches on a tree will be lost, and when they encounter this unprovoked disaster, they can only resign themselves to fate. This is what is called "natural disaster and poor harvest." However, if they encounter caterpillars, they can use manpower to eliminate them. It is said that smearing a little lime water on the roots of peach trees is very effective in repelling caterpillars. They are more diligent in protecting peaches than they are in treating their own children. Once the peaches begin to bear fruit and grow, they have to spend a lot of effort to wrap each peach with sorghum stalks to prevent the branches from not being able to bear the weight of the peaches, or from being unable to resist the attack of storms. A tree bears about a hundred peaches, but if it bears so many this year, it will be limited by the strength of the land and will be reduced or even not bear any next year, even if there is no damage from unprovoked disasters. This is what they call "resting branches."</p>
<p>The variety of peaches produced here is probably more than any other place. According to them, there are as many as fifty kinds, but what I have heard from the general public is roughly four kinds: "flat peaches," "hairy peaches," "May peaches," and "honey peaches." I remember that the Longhua "flat peaches" I ate in Shanghai one year were almost the same as the "flat peaches" here, but the taste of the "flat peaches" here is even better than the "flat peaches." The "hairy peaches" produced in various places in Jiangnan are small in shape, but the "hairy peaches" produced here are actually much larger than those produced in Jiangnan. "May Fresh" and "Honey Peach" are probably the most famous specialties here. The water content they contain is not as fresh and sweet as even the best "Cold Peach" produced in Shen County. As for the size of the peaches, I am afraid that most people would not believe it. The largest peaches seen in the Tianjin-Beijing area are no more than the size of a teacup, but they are not easy to see often. Although Shanghai is a place where everything is available, even teacup-sized peaches cannot be seen. But here, peaches as big as rice bowls are very common. The minimum weight of a peach is fourteen ounces; a heavier one is about a pound, so peaches here are mostly sold by the number. The color of the peaches is also different from other places. Ordinary peaches are mostly a combination of red and green, and even the so-called "white-faced peaches" are still a bit light green. But the peaches here are pure white, and the taste is as sweet as sugar. If you don't pay attention and take a bite, I guarantee that your chest and face will be splashed with peach juice. This kind of peach is indeed more worthy of the name than the Fenghua "honey peaches."</p>
<p>The largest sales outlet for Feicheng peaches is Jinan, while local sales are very limited, because each household has peach trees. The price of one hundred peaches sold in "Tao Xing" is about thirteen or fourteen yuan, but in Jinan, they are sold for three or four mao per peach. On the one hand, it is because the vegetable and fruit stores in Jinan want to make a profit from it, and on the other hand, it is because of the inconvenience of transportation, and it costs a lot of money to carry them to Jinan by porters, so you can't eat cheap peaches in Jinan. Also because of the inconvenience of transportation, the popularity of Feicheng peaches can only be limited to the province. Moreover, its output is high, and the consumption capacity of Shandong Province alone is still a bit oversupplied. Therefore, the general "Tao Xing" can only use other methods to promote its sales. Every year, the peaches produced are divided into two types: the large and intact ones are sold retail on the market, and the slightly smaller and somewhat damaged ones are sold in large quantities to Jinan Taifeng Company to manufacture canned food. In total, about seven or eight thousand yuan of peaches are sold to Taifeng every year.</p>
<p>Finally, there is also a historical fact about Feicheng peaches that I would like to talk about as a conclusion to this short essay. In the former Qing Dynasty, Feicheng peaches were required to be collected by the county government from each "Tao Xing" as tributes before the peaches were sold, but the county magistrate often spared no effort to select peaches by various methods in order to please the emperor. The most common method was to place the collected peaches one by one on an iron ring the size of a bowl mouth, and any peach that fell out of the iron ring would not be selected. This had been tested in advance, and only peaches that could not pass through the iron ring weighed as much as fourteen ounces.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Views on Reading in the Past and Present <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Ge</p>
<p>Reading is a good thing, which is universally known. Therefore, a philosophy of "all professions are inferior, only reading is superior" has always been popular in Chinese society, and readers have indeed received special respect in society because of this. However, the golden age of readers seems to have passed. In recent years, people in society have greatly changed their views on readers. On the one hand, because these people who are neither good at writing nor at martial arts, even after graduating from university, still cannot get rich or promoted, or even unemployed and idle, not being able to support their parents or raise their children, everyone in society looks down on readers. Even a great writer and author cannot be compared with a comprador of a bank and cannot receive the same respect. As for when he returns to his family, it is really like Su Qin returning home after failing the imperial examination, with his parents not considering him as a son, his sister-in-law not considering him as an uncle, and his wife not considering him as a husband. On the other hand, it is also because people who have read books think that they know everything, so they make unwarranted criticisms and like to discuss the past and criticize the present, becoming a symbol of being troublemakers, and everyone hates them. Because of this, readers in recent years have become a symbol of idlers in society, and many families are also wary of continuing to send their children to school.</p>
<p>Regardless of how society in the past recognized reading as a good thing, society today is despising it, but both of these views are probably based on the private position of individuals and their families, rather than evaluating them from a social point of view. Because in terms of the former view, it is entirely caused by the social habit of "excelling in learning and then becoming an official" in old Chinese society. The so-called "excelling in learning and then becoming an official" means that as long as an individual studies well, he can soar to great heights, rise from the ground, and achieve the purpose of getting promoted and rich, to glorify himself and bring honor to his family. Therefore, it is said that the purpose of this kind of reading is entirely for the individual. Conversely, the reason why modern popular education has developed and schools have increased day by day is that the fundamental requirement of society is the result of modern capitalism needing workers who can bear the work of scientific labor production. However, the situation in China is slightly different. The development of industry has already lagged behind, and the constraints of external forces have made it difficult to progress, and the exploitation of imperialism has caused many families to go bankrupt and individuals to become unemployed. Therefore, the number of labor producers cultivated by school education far exceeds the proportion it can accommodate, and the unemployment of intellectuals has become a large-scale problem. However, these so-called readers, their individuals and their families, also view this as a way to soar to great heights, get promoted, and get rich. Now, they have spent a large amount of tuition fees first, but in the end, they can only end up not being able to maintain the lives of individuals and families. Therefore, the concept of despising reading has arisen. Correctly speaking, this concept of despising readers and the past view of valuing readers still have the same starting point, that is, they are entirely calculating and planning based on private interests.</p>
<p>Naturally, we cannot say that reading has no meaning of aiming at personal interests, but we must know that individuals cannot live apart from society and people at all, so individual interests also need the guarantee of the interests of society and everyone. Therefore, the purpose of reading should mainly be based on the foundation of being used for society. If we only say in general terms that reading is for use, but the way to use it is only for oneself, not based on the foundation of using it for society and people, then the development of intelligence and knowledge can really inspire human cunning and deception, and society and individuals will be disturbed and harmed by the so-called readers.</p>
<p>The knowledge heritage of mankind was originally social, and it was precisely for the progress of society and the interests of the people that it was preserved. Moreover, it also needs the strength of society and the cooperation of the people to use that knowledge for reproduction. From this point of view, the legitimate heritage of human knowledge is fundamentally social rather than personal, and it can only benefit mankind when it is used for the benefit of society and the public. The so-called reading is originally to obtain the heritage of human knowledge from the preservation and inheritance of language and characters, so in inheriting its knowledge heritage, we must also inherit the fundamental role that was passed on to us for the purpose of promoting society and people. Only in this way can we truly understand the true meaning of reading, and only then can we be considered to have truly read books. Obvious facts tell us, for example, when we read books on natural science, not only is the knowledge in these books a total heritage produced by the long-term cooperation of society, gathering countless inventions of mankind from ancient times to the present, but also these theories and rules are the common property of society, and no individual can possess them privately. If people inherit it and use it as a tool for their personal profit-making, then society will inevitably suffer from it. A prominent example is that modern natural science has been used as a production weapon of modern capitalism, which has caused various social contradictions, created endless economic paralysis, and has been used to manufacture and improve weapons of murder, creating unprecedented cruel wars, causing society and individuals to suffer great harm as a result.</p>
<p>In short, reading should be for the purpose of the welfare of society and the people, and one should not read with the purpose of personal gain. Therefore, when we read, we should reject the theories in it that contradict the welfare of society and the people, and when we use what we have learned, we should not take personal interests as the premise, but should take seeking the interests of society and the people as the premise. In this way, personal interests will naturally be resolved together in the resolution of the interests of society and the people. The current social point of view and many young people all regard reading as a means of seeking a way out for themselves, and only know to seek knowledge in books that is conducive to personal profit-making, and do not strive to seek knowledge that can be used for society. This tendency is wrong. It is precisely because they have this error that when they cannot eat well and dress well after reading, they fundamentally deny that reading is a beneficial thing.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Introducing Books on New Writing Research <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>A few days ago, I bought a book published by the Chinese Latinization Research Association, "Latinization of Chinese Writing," at Uchiyama Bookstore, and I felt extremely interested after reading it. This is the first systematic research book on Latinization that I have seen. This book is very helpful for those who are wholeheartedly engaged in the literacy movement. Its contents include: "Introduction to Chinese Latinization," "Principles of Chinese Latinization," "Detailed Plan for the Latinization of Northern Mandarin," "The Mission of Latinization and Intellectuals," and an appendix "Chinese-Latinized Parallel Readings," etc. in six major chapters. This small book succinctly answers many questions, allowing readers to gain a fairly clear understanding of Latinization after reading it once.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, "Introduction to Chinese Latinization," the author answers the doubts and objections of the general public towards Latinization, explaining that Latinization is not only a simple and easy-to-learn writing system, but also a language tool for the masses. It also criticizes the shortcomings and unreasonable aspects of the Chinese character reform movement (phonetic symbols and National Language Romanization) in the past. This article is written in an extremely concise and easy-to-understand manner, with a special style.</p>
<p>"Principles of Chinese Latinization" explains that only by standing on a scientific position can a language suitable for the modern masses be created, and points out the impossibility of the National Language Movement, and that the current Latinization of different dialects in various regions is a necessary stage for raising the cultural level of the masses and contributing to the future unified language. It gives researchers of the Chinese language a necessary direction.</p>
<p>The article "Detailed Plan for the Latinization of Northern Mandarin" contains chapters on: letters and pronunciation, the construction of phonemes, the writing of words, and the writing of speech. In the introduction of this article, the author skillfully explained that "writing an article is speaking." This "analysis of speech" is very necessary for the illiterate masses. Such detailed writing rules have never existed even in the National Language Romanization. The chapter on writing words together is especially interesting. People who are used to reading and writing square characters may initially find this kind of linked writing rules a bit awkward at first glance, but as long as you think about it carefully, you can know that this is necessary and reasonable. For example, connecting all the "的" (de, possessive particle) with the preceding word, people who are used to reading English may find it awkward, but in my opinion, it is extremely desirable. In this word-linking rule, there are many places that boldly treat the Chinese language in a big way, and most of them have proved that this attempt has been successful. People who read this small book with humility will have the same feeling as me.</p>
<p>The short essay "Latinization and the Mission of Intellectuals" tells us how we should give the text to everyone, which is worth reading carefully.</p>
<p>The final appendix is ​​interesting and practical. Several telegrams and communications made me feel more interested. The last short story, "The Messenger," is a literary work created with Latinized text. It is worth being amazed that there are already such creations at present. Remembering the writing rules in the plan, reading this part of the comparison reading, and then going to read newspapers and write articles will not feel much difficulty.</p>
<p>This small book of seventy-seven pages is priced at only two jiao and five fen. It is available at Uchiyama Bookstore at the end of North Sichuan Road in this port. Anyone who intends to study the Chinese language problem should buy it and read it.</p>

<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>(1) How Did the Chinese People Step Out into the World?</p>
<p>China's interactions with Western European countries have a long history. As for the many countries in Southeast Asia, such as Annam and Burma, they were once part of China's territory. Therefore, the relationship between Southeast Asia and China is undoubtedly even older. However, the real colonization of various countries around the world by China, and the appearance of overseas Chinese in various parts of the world, can be said to have occurred after the intrusion of Western European capitalism into China and various parts of the world.</p>
<p>In the past, China's economy was an agricultural, handicraft, and commercial economy. After the invasion of modern capitalist forces, this type of economic structure was bound to collapse. In this collapse, many farmers and craftsmen were unable to maintain their original jobs and lifestyles, and therefore had to leave their places of residence and go elsewhere to find a way out. However, although China's inherent economic structure collapsed rapidly due to the invasion of capitalism, the new industries failed to develop at a rate proportional to this collapse. As a result, they could not accommodate the large numbers of farmers and craftsmen who came out of the countryside, forcing them to go abroad to seek a living. Needless to say, at that time there were already ships going everywhere, and transportation was relatively convenient, making it easier to go from China to various parts of the world. Thus, Chinese people gradually appeared in various parts of the world, working in the Americas, doing business in Southeast Asia, and reclaiming wasteland in Africa... Accordingly, we can say that China's colonization of various parts of the world is different from that of advanced European and American countries and even ××: They colonize the world due to the development of their own capitalism, while we are forced to go to the world to find a way to survive due to the invasion of foreign capitalist forces and the deformed development of our own economy. They colonize the world by means of their country's economic, political, and even military power, while we are many citizens who are unable to live under their aggression and automatically go to the world to make a living.

<p>Elopement Lyrics (1) (Sung by Cang Yinqiu)</p>
<p>The wind moves the curtains, the moon falls on the steps, how can I arrange my feelings? He is so heartless, robbing me of my freedom, leaving me. Good things are hard to come by, happiness suddenly turns to sorrow...</p>
<p>Lyrics (2) (Sung by Cang Yinqiu)</p>
<p>The zither curtain is predestined from a previous life, the red apricot over the wall cannot be restrained. I am not made of grass, wood, iron, or stone, and I am not as stupid as a pig or an ox.</p>
<p>I only blame the old man under the moon for making a confused decision on the mandarin duck score. Every time, I secretly grieve in front of the flowers and under the moon. Since ancient times, beautiful women have had tragic fates.</p>
<p>I advise people to wake up from their dreams, idle flowers and wild grasses are the root of disaster. As the saying goes, one wrong step leads to eternal regret, and it is already a hundred years before you can turn back.</p>
