<h3>工商業放欵之期待</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>當新貨幣政策未實行前。工商業喁唱以望者。爲幣制之改革。旣行未匝月。工商業焦急不安者。爲成效之未覩。蓋其始衷。以爲一朝能改革。不難得鉅額資金。收復興之效。而不念貨幣政策之轉變。僅爲初步計書之實現。工商事業之發展。尙有待於各方之努力。卽以國貨工廠而論。平時不爲原料自給作準備。專事稗販舶品。貪圖便利。及匯價昻貴。原料價漲。購買力非一時所能提高。售價遂不能與之俱進。此固爲現今不易避免之事實。工商業亦未嘗不知之。知之而怠於自謀。祇望原料商漲價弗太驟。庸可得乎。</p>
<p>竊以爲工商業所當自處者。應各就本身作檢點。謀改進。即如同一紗廠。人能得利。我獨虧本。其失敗由來。大都不從出品經營上求進取。但知從投機市塲中圖暴利。投機失敗。事業隨之若果能用其投機之。精神財力於改善事業。取得原料。則何至有今日之失敗耶。</p>
<p>夫欲戢投機之弊風。集資金於生產。意固甚善。但如增加市塲之籌碼。不爲適當之運用。或更足助長投機之氣燄。故當根究投機之所以能投機者何在。爲正本淸源之計。不必拘拘於投機目的物之處置。而治絲益棼也。</p>
<p>今工商業所期望者。仍爲如何能使銀行業接受其產品蹬劵地產等類之抵押供其周轉之用。要知現行貨幣政策。爲現金集中而不兌現之辦法。仍需六成現金作準備。非如紙幣政策之可濫發無度也。雖以一先令兩便士半之元價。用舊有之銀幣作準備。自可增發不少。但總須視供求爲調劑。過此則爲膨脹矣。又卽使力能增發紙幣。而是否足以應工商業之需求。能否减低市塲利率。收回高利債券。亦屬疑問。市塲上如驟增大宗紙幣。雖云可由銀行加以調節然一或不愼。流弊滋大。故工商業不當責銀行不立卽擴張信用。而當問信用之應如何擴張。不應但責人之不己助。而不知自助人始能助之。當此嚴重關頭。須得各方恊力。才有復興之望。工商業宜有以知自效也。</p>

<h3>菲律賓的前途</h3>
<p>— 昂若</p>
<p>菲律濱自治政府已於十一月十五日正式成立了。在美國與遠東的關係上，這是一個新時期的開始，十年之後，菲律賓就可以成為完全自由獨立的國家了。不過，從世界一般的局勢，以及遠東方面的風雲變幻看來，菲律賓能夠保持它的獨立嗎？根據現在的獨立法，菲島的經濟，脫離美國之後，要圖自存非常困難，假使菲島的經濟機構崩潰了，紛亂發生了，有什麼可以阻止日本不藉口干涉，而再演侵略滿洲的往事？日本的帝國主義是不能輕易看過的，這種憂懼的心理會使菲律賓的領袖人物籲請美國對菲仍舊保持或種經濟的甚至於政治的關係的。</p>
<p>美國自始即以提倡對外貿易為改善菲島經濟的步驟的，菲律賓與美國自一九〇九年起，即行完全自由貿易，起初尚有若干限額，不過這類限額到一九一三年已完全取消，此後二國通商完全不受任何關稅的障碍。菲律賓對外貿易自此即見激增，自一九〇九年至一九二九年，二十年間的進出口總值增加到百分之三七〇之鉅。</p>
<p>這種貿易的發達有二點很關重要。第一，菲律賓一變而不能擺脫美國市場。一九〇〇年，美國祇吸收菲貨輸出的百分之一二。至一九三四年，美國佔菲輸入的百分之六五，佔菲輸出的百分之八七。第二要點在於菲島出口貨集中於寥寥數種農產品，糖佔菲島輸出總額的百分之六〇以上，且全數消售美國市場。去年，糖，椰子，棕，和菸草四種，物產佔菲輸出總額百分之九以上。這種貿易的發達也不是單方面的。</p>
<p>菲律賓為美國全部出口貨的主顧，在一九三三年佔第八位，棉布，牛酪，和捲菸則佔第一位，至於肉和鋼鐵製造品亦為遠東方面最好的消費者。菲人已經愛用美國貨，所以潛在的市場或者更有價值。</p>
<p>這種貿易雖屬互相有利，然而菲島的經濟根本上實不健全。菲島的繁榮，過於依靠對外貿易，而且過於依靠美國市場。在政治方面，菲島紫來是堅定的向自治方面進展，但在經濟方面，它們也是一樣堅定的趨向與美國樹立不可分離的密切關係。</p>
<p>假使菲島的獨立是準備自己負起獨立的重任的，自然又當別論。實際上，美國議會的動機並非如此。美國議會的通過獨立案無非是由於某某幾種農民團體的壓迫，以為由此可以樹立稅壁排斥菲貨進口，如其不是要抵制菲糖和椰子油，菲律賓的獨立問題恐怕還是空談哩。</p>
<p>在經濟恐慌之前，沒有一個美國人反對菲貨進口。但在一九三〇年，糖，及國內的肉油等物產價格大跌，農民團體開始活動。它們以為菲糖和椰子油的免稅進口，是美國農產物跌價的主因。起初它們運動對菲貨輸入徵稅，後來它們覺得菲島如仍留在美國旗幟之下，徵進口稅是辦不到的，於趁它們決定贊助獨立運動</p>
<p>這事的證據很多，參議員黑富林的言論可為代表，他說，「他們（菲律賓人）好像一塊大磨石掛在棉花，花生，豆，和穀類生產者的頸項。讓我們給他們獨立罷。……讓我們恢復菲人的自由罷。……此後這類價廉而物不美的物品如再進口侵害我們美國農民，我們就可向之抽稅了。」　菲糖和椰子油的輸入對於美糖和肉油等物價會有不良的影饗實難以置信。即以糖一項而論，美國從沒有自足過。一九三三年，美國所產的糖僅足供其所需的百分之二六·五。它自夏威夷輸入百分之一五·五，自坡都列哥輸入百分之一二·五，自菲律賓輸入百分之二〇。其餘的百分之二五·五，是由古巴供給的。免稅的菲糖實不足以影響美國糖產的物價，不言可喻了。</p>
<p>不過已往十年中，菲糖輸出的激增對於古巴糖的銷路確有不良的影響，因此與古巴糖有關係的紐約財閥也加入擁護菲島獨立。但是這此財閥與農業團體，並不公開合作，因為二者對於抵制菲律賓的競爭固抱同一志趣，然而後者也同樣的要取消古巴糖的優惠稅率呢。至於椰子油問題，在許多方面，情形也是相同的。</p>
<p>美國農民團體排擠菲律賓的運動，不是昧於事實，便是受華盛頓方面議會裏一部份人的愚弄，他們就此可藉菲島獨立問題奔走忙碌，故意顯示他們地位的重要，而不是受人　　無所事事者可比。</p>
<p>菲島獨立案的本身很能表現出這種黑幕。一方面在完全獨立前十年自治期間，菲島的市場必須開放給美貨自由貿易，在另一方面，菲糖，椰子油和繩索輸往美國即須受分配額的限制。自治期的後五年間，菲政府更須徵收特別出口稅。美國議會，對這片面辦法，心猶未足，沒有等到獨立案簽署，又復通過對椰于油徵收國產稅怯，並對進口糖規定分配額的限制。</p>
<p>斐島完全失去了美國市塲之後，椰子油業以及雪茄菸業必告完全崩潰。不過菲島的椰子乾和菸業，世界仍有此需要，所以基本的椰子業和菸草業可以不受重大的打擊。</p>
<p>糖為最嚴重的問題。因為美國化的關係，菲糖成本很高。美國市場如不開放，准許自由貿易，菲島糖業很難樂觀。菲人依靠糖業為生的在二百萬以上，更以政府收入，糖稅也佔百分之六，糖業的崩潰實足影響全部獨立的試驗。假使衛生和教育之類的政務因為缺乏經費而停頓，政局也就不會安定。</p>
<p>糖的輸出對於菲島銀行和其他機關的安全也有密切的關係。據十八個月前斐督的報告，菲島十家銀行的放欵，糖業佔百分之四七，國立銀行放欵二千二百五十萬元美金，糖業佔百分之七七。國營馬尼刺鐵路的收入，糖的運費佔百分之四。</p>
<p>菲島脫離美國，設能不受其他外力干與，即使貧弱也還能夠圖存。但是遠東的局勢是不能有這種保障的。菲人因須解決自衛和自存的問題，即是最樂觀的也不夢想編練海陸軍就能抵禦外侮。唯一的希望在於加入國聯並由國際保陣它的永久中立的地位，或者與一強國締結同盟。</p>
<p>加入國聯固有價值，但這於遠東方面的弱國是沒有多大保障的，西方強國也不願與菲政府訂立攻守同盟的。這種同盟對於大國是沒有多大價值，反足招致日本的反感。唯一的解決辦法遂在中立化，就是聯合與遠東有關係的　國，共同保障菲島的獨立。這也是獨立案創議人的意思。他們以為菲島位於中心要害之地，關係各國是願意保障它的中立，而不願置它們自己的屬地於險境的。但日本常是一個阻力。即使中立化成功了，它是否足為保障嗎？中立的瑞士固足使人艷羨，但是中立的比利時也不能忘記罷。</p>
<p>真正的政治問題是日本。菲島的地位很屬重要，其他足以吸引日本的特點也很多。日本如其佔領了菲律賓群島，它即控制全部東亞海岸綫的列島，可以更深的侵入英荷屬地了。</p>
<p>殖民也趁一個問題。日本人現在僑居菲島的有二萬，大部份是久居於大伐省。菲島是利於移民的。菲島人口平均為每方哩百二十人。菲島的物產也是日本所需要的，它的鐵藏佔遠東第一位，金，鉛，錳，銘，所在多有，堅良的木材達四六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇寬呎以上。</p>
<p>日本人對菲島經濟侵略是沒有問題的。他們可藉投資開發富庶的物產，可壟斷菲島進口市場。日本人已在台灣發展糖業，超過他們自己的需要，所以日菲的經濟關係是不能解決菲島的糖業問題。</p>
<p>美國對菲關係怎麼樣呢？十年後完全退出的政策也許會實行的。華盛頓方面許多有力份子以為菲島是美國的世界地位上一躬點，美國退出之後或許會避免對日戰爭的危險性。至於放棄菲島任令日本宰割，以及美國三十年的經營和基督教文化的薰陶付之東流，這些人是不關痛癢的。</p>
<p>第二條路是美國修正獨立法，廢除出口稅的規定，而在財政和關稅方面以廣大的自治權賦予菲政府。美政府更對菲糖，椰子油和其他物品訂立優惠商約。這樣可免除犧牲菲島以利美國經濟團體之譏了。</p>
<p>第三種解決辦法就是把菲島置於或種自治領土地位，使美菲二國發生永久的政治關係。這於菲島共和的前途愈有保障。英怯及荷蘭對之也可愈加滿意。</p>
<p>總之，美國對於菲人及其前途如有任何責任心，那末現行的通商窒碍應當廢除，而代以別種辦法，務使菲人得以維持其獨立。美國如不再存任何責任心，如不惜以國家的政策犧牲於一部份人的自私的企圖，那末國人也應洞悉其真相罷。（節譯美國GraysonL．Kirk論文）</p>

經說明了近代科學的起點以及科學猛進的狀況，對於科學發達史，擬分下列四種來講：（一）近代以前的科學；（二）近代科學猛進的原因；（三）各基本科學發達簡史；（四）中國科學簡史及已往科學在中國不發達的原因；　　（一）近代以前的科學　　科學的發達究竟在何時，是不容易決定的，嚴格講起來，日月行動的觀察　簡單器械的發明，都應該算為物理學的起源，據考古學家的推測，萬年以前人類已經會用石製器械，那時已知應用物理了，如果要根據歷史可考記載的話，歐洲文化來自希臘，希臘文化又來自埃及和巴比倫，中國與印度雖然同為古國，但是影響歐洲文化絕少。埃及與巴比倫土地膏腴，物產豐富，人民生活優俗，可以研究學問，同時兩國都有河水汎濫的困難，使不得不設法解決，因此簡單的天文數學與幾何，在兩國發達最早。「需要是發明之母。」數學與生活及貿易的關係是極明顯的，而天文與幾何也是因實際需要而產生的，埃及的尼羅河每年定期汎濫，汪洋一片成為澤國，所以埃及人不得不計算時間的長短以為預防，於是有天文歷數的產生，河水汎濫以後，隴畝沖積陷沒，必須測量以為徵稅的標準，於是有幾何學的產生，巴比倫也有同樣的情形，因為度量衡基本單位與生活有密切關係，在紀元前二千五百年，巴比倫對於長度與質量的單位，都已有法律的規定，這是一件很值得注意的科學史實。　　希臘民性活潑，富有獨立精神，他們研究科學的目的也與埃及人和巴比倫人不同，希臘人不為應用而研究科學，乃為學問而研究科學所以希臘的科學是比較有組織的，有系統的，注重理論的，而且牠的範圍也比較廣大。各門科學都已萌芽思想獨到的地方很多，歐凡里得所著幾何學為數千年來研究幾何學的張本，亞力山大在二三〇年前的希臘就命令各處將動植飛潛的物品送到雅典分類儲藏，實在是分類學的先導。同時亞幾默德對力學的槓桿原理，同水力學的浮力，都有重要的發明，他的浮力定律是人所共知的，諸位可知道他對槓桿定律已有深刻的認識！他說如果你有一根長桿及一個地方放支點，你一人可以將地球舉起！當時諸哲學家對於宇宙構造原子理論，天演進化等學說也有種種推測，可惜沒有充分的科學根據　　繼希臘而起的就趁羅馬，版圖極其廣大，北邊到萊茵·冬瑞兩河，南邊到埃及，東邊到幼付拉底斯河，西邊到西班牙，對於傳播希臘的文化及溝通東方與西方文化有很大的功勞。羅馬人注重實用，與希臘人完全相反，對於科學也是這樣。羅馬的天文，數學研究遠不及希臘，而於工程·地理解剖等實用科學則有很大的貢獻。威祚威宴著有建築學一書，稱為建築學的鼻祖，他這書算為中世紀建築學唯一的傑作，以後一千五百多年中歐洲建築家都拏他做範本，期脫勒波就他多年遊歷所得，著為地理學，對於自然與人文地理兩方面都極注意，這也是受注重實用的影響，葛倫研究解剖學發明感覺神經與運動神經。以後一千四百年中間沒有能同他齊名的，西歷五六九年哲斯亭尼王通令全國封禁學校不許人研究希臘學問，開了三百年黑暗的時期，到了第八世紀，回教傳入歐洲，而阿拉伯及印度的學術也就傳到歐洲各國。力·十兩世紀敎主更獎勵學校，設立大學有十幾所之多。學術空氣漸漸恢復，自十一世紀之初到十三世紀之末二百年間，十字軍凍征，有八次之多，使東西文化更外融洽，阿拉伯吸收印度文化對於科學的重要貢獻有，（一）數學，阿拉伯數學比希臘羅馬都簡單，很能帮助數學的進步。（二）化學，阿拉伯人崇尚宗教，求「學金術」觀念特別濃厚，對鍊金術也有特別研究，因此對於化學的技術頗有供獻，例如蒸溜，昇華，硫酸，硝酸亞水，阿人皆能利用之以求點金石。（三）指南針，阿拉伯人航海時，用磁石以定方向，方法將磁石置木塞上放於水上，靜止時一端指南，一端指北，西班牙與葡萄牙人得之，遂能行全球而開近代史的先河。（未完）</h3>

<p>春秋點滴  （寓意）　　早一些離開學校，就這說沒有畢業便離關了學校，也未始沒有好處的。因為能早一些明瞭社會的真相。　　一天發現了我家娘姨把肥皂偷偷的藏在一雙無人注意的桌子的抽屜裏；又一天翻翻一本十七年前商務印書館發行的英文雜誌，發現了我國一個做××部長的某博士，舞弊的新聞。前者是毫無知識的；後者是受過最高的教育的，可是同樣的幹了不名譽的勾當，雖道營私舞弊，真是我國人的劣根性嗎？　　沒有看過現在的新文學一眼，而便痛詆它的不是；和沒有看過我國的古文學一眼，而便硬說它的不足學。二者俱失。還有一種　不能看懂古文學而說它陳　不合時的，那是最無恥的了，說酒話  張凰　　飲酒有酒腸，頗若一般人之別有酒腸焉。酒腸之寬窄，人至不一，莫得而強。蘇東坡曰：「予飲酒終日不過五合，天下之不能飲者無在予下者。然喜人飲酒，見客舉盃徐引，則予胸中為之浩浩焉，落落焉，酣滴之味乃過於客。閒居未嘗一日無客，客至未嘗不置酒；天天之之奸飲亦無在予上者！」其不能飲而好酒之態　獲予心矣！予之飲也，飲於表：黃酒一盃而顏　，白酒入喉則引嚏，可謂不能飲之至者矣！而予貯酒應客，必有牛莊高粱，有老船友薛阿根自產地攜來，貧無問焉。每得豪飲之客，側席勸進，亦正不勝「勸君更盡一盃酒，與爾同消萬古愁」之情！予何前世不修，今世與酒無綠如是！此亦修修來世之道歟？一笑！　　人事皆有品，惟酒品不一。花間月下，曲水流觴，一盃清醉，酒入詩腸，此之謂儒飲，如雅人蘊藉一般。二三良友，月夕花晨，名姝四座，低唱淺斟，此之謂仙飲，如瑤池醉月一般。禮席豐筵，繁文褥節，終日拘攣，惟恐僭越，此之謂凶飲，如拘禁罪囚一般。盃不厭大，酒要滿斟，持籌呼高，大肆鯨吞，此之謂驢飲，如行路渴驢一般。冠袍帶履，坐分昭穆，讓箸舉盃，納身軌物，此之謂葬飲，如衣冠斂葬一般。倒地謾駡，嘔嘰成渠，僵臥不醒，人事不知，此之靑尸飲，如餓莩倒臥一般。友人田飲詩曰：「邨酒香甜魚稻肥，幾人暢飲到斜暉？天寬地闊知何有，家家扶得醉人歸。」此又飲中逸品！以上見淸季程世爵「笑林廣見」。書中盡記笑話。頗多粗詞村言，惟此則風趣獨饒，頗與幽夢影筆墨相似。至理之文，不忍湮廢，乃附笑林而傳，不計莊諧之雜出矣。蹺婆婆  阿良　　蹺婆婆是我家的老僕婦，我們兄弟幾個人，都是由伊提攜長大的。母親因為伊在我家多年，又念伊很辛苦，常常對我們說：「你們不要老是叫伊「蹺媽媽」了，應得改個口號，叫伊一聲「婆婆」。　　以後我們不敢再叫伊為蹺媽媽，就也改為不自然而又難聽的「婆婆」了；然而從小叫慣了這個「蹺」的我們，在初次改換的時侯，往往有點困難，每次遇見了伊，終不免把這個「蹺」宇，預先不由自主的脫口而出；因之，「婆婆」又一變而為「蹺婆婆」了。　　伊什麼事都肯幹，常常這個方才做完，接着就去幹做那個一天到晚，差不多沒有空閑的。有時，母親看伊實在太勞苦了，叫伊休息一下再幹，伊卻不肯依從；母親曉得伊性情是這樣，所以並不去睬伊，然而伊祗是這般的不辭勞瘁呵　　伊在每年的夏間，終要種一大批的秋葵花和莧菜梗，待秋葵開得很鬧旺，莧菜梗長得和人一樣高了，伊才把葵花盡行採下，洗淨，藏於小甕中，還倒入許多芝蔴油。莧說：「這是火傷藥，小孩子被火傷了身體，敷此，沒有一個不好的！」再把萈菜梗拔下，切成許多小段，和鹽開水灌入甕中，待這菜梗霉腐，便成了　味的「霉菜梗」，於是伊把它一盌盌的妥出來，這給近地貧窮的人家吃。至於火傷藥，那更是遠折人們所受的無景嘉惠！　　有一天，隔璧的周伯伯對伊說：「蹺媽呵！你不要為人家打算了，這樣大年紀，喜歡吃的，該買點吃了，何必這樣自苦？伊說：「年紀大，我並不管，反正我的身後，都已齊備，我又沒有兒子，要這多下的錢何用」　　伊死去快將一年了，近處鄰居，還在股着伊的故事，有的，且為伊哀哭。我們屋後的荒間中，到如今依然還有幾叢秋葵花的遺種，在那裏欹斜地站立着！梅龕小品  梅　　自「摩登」之說流行，「時髦」二字，遂為陳腐名詞，不知昔時尚有「風流人」之稱。晉書外戚傳：「王濛嘗與孫綽商略諸「風流人」。實則「風流人」即「時髦」，「時髦」即「歷登」，一而三三而一者也。　　滬俗罯人輒曰：「豬玀」，而明時竟有朱鷺其人。初名家棟，字白民，善寫竹，工古文詞，著有名山游草。予謂此君若生今日，人將以諧聲故，聞其姓名而失笑矣。　　租界工部局有種牛痘不取分文之布告，實則此例早開於前淸道光時，曾見道光時鄭光祖之一斑錄有云：「人生必出痘一次。種而出者，不雜時疾，痘必較輕，故俗例孩童必延痘科種痘，余至茅山，見句容縣官出曉諭，禁止民間私自種痘，凡種痘，縣城當官設局，有醫學訓導主之，以牛痘為苗。牛痘乃小牛所出之痘，視小牛眼眶有痘粒者，即是。其家報者，賞錢一千，但取痘苗，無損於牛，以種嬰孩之痘，百不失一，不受分文酬謝，若有私種之徒，在鄉招搖撞騙，以誤孩童者，立拿究治。報信者亦賞錢一千，拿獲者賞錢二千，此事罕聞，特誌之。」觀此可知公開種痘之起始矣。　　雨花臺石，名著全國，有瑪瑙石尤為佳品。我友吟水在京供職，謂雨花石搜羅已盡，現所售者，均為江北六合靈岩石，非真雨花石矣。　　金聖歎一代奇才，以抗糧哭廟案事，不得善終，惜哉！其遺著坊間可採購者，有所批水滸，西廂，杜詩，左傳，國語，國策，史記，漢書，唐文，宋文，雜釋，尺牘等等。要皆讀書有得之言。頃聞程瑤笙師言：「曾見聖歡親題某畫卷，詩固雋妙，書怯又絕挺秀。」聖歎真多才多藝哉！　　我國之水蜜桃，與美國之蘋果。為同世界著名產物，日本人慕之，遂覓得佳種，設怯自栽。今則日本且以水蜜桃運銷我國，以蘋果運銷美國。園藝家許崇文為予言。　　介紹新著　「康健世界」創刊號，業已出版，內容械為充實。關於人生康健之理論與經驗，及一般醫藥常識，均由專家撰述，透切詳明，誠靑年及新家庭必備之佳著。全年十二冊，預定五角，社址同孚路二一四弄一四號。拉雜話玉山草堂  徐澐　　元季觀阿瑛玉山草堂，與倪高士淸　閣雲林堂齊名，延攬四方之士，詩酒喝和，殆無　日。余旣作清　閣考，復於諸家筆乘，得關於草堂者若干則，彙錄之篋中，偶一　觀，思古之情，油然生焉。　　玉山草堂，在縣西界豁上，顧德輝仲瑛所築，虞集書額，中有芝雲堂，可詩齋，浣花館，讀書舍，釣月軒，夾　軒，春賱樓，秋華亭，澹香亭，君子亭，春草池，碧梧翠竹館，雪巢，小蓬萊，淥波亭，絳雪亭，聽雪齋，百花坊，拜石壇，柳塘春，金栗影，寒翠所，總名玉山佳處，外有書畫舫，為仲瑛西墅，三月三日，觴楊廉夫於其中，侍姬素雲，行椰子酒，遂成聯句，放鶴亭，亦仲瑛築。（崑新兩縣續修合志）　　購古書，名畫，彝鼎，秘玩，築別業於茜涇西，曰玉山佳處，晨夕與客置酒賦詩其中。四方文學士，河東張翥，會稽楊維楨，天台柯九思，永嘉李孝光，方外士張雨，于彥，成琦，元璞輩，咸主其家。園池　榭之盛，圖丈之富，　餼館聲伎，並冠絕一時。（明史顧德輝傳）（王宏緒明史稿同）　　于舊地之西偏，疊石為小山，築草堂于其址，左右亭館若干所，旁植雜花木，以梧竹相映帶，總名為玉山佳處。（顧德輝自撰金粟道人墓誌銘）　　玉山草堂寒翠石，本維揚土忠玉家快哉亭舊物，上有東坡題識，至元戊寅四月，仲瑛得之於城東尼菴，菴即周太尉宅，斷垣之外，石欹臥於高梧之下，仲瑛以粟易歸，立諸中庭，明年，奎章閣鑒書博士丹邱柯敬仲見而奇之，再拝而去。瑛遂砌石為壇，及御史白野達兼善來觀，嘉柯之逸，為作古篆拜石二字，又隸寒翠，以美其名。仲瑛自為記并詩，詩云：「好事久傷無米顛，淸泉白石亦凄然，快哉亭下坡僊友，拜倒丹邱三百年。」（顧德輝玉山草堂集）　　秦約仲文，嘗得趙文敏所篆澹香二字，以貽仲瑛，仲瑛因築斯亭，邀同人賦之。（殷奎淡香亭詩序）　　隱居顧仲瑛氏，居婁江之上，引婁之水，入其居之西小墅，為桃花源。厠水之亭四楹，高不踰　仞，上蓬下板，旁檽翼然，似艦　，客坐臥其中，夢與波動盪，若有繿而走者。予嘗醉吹鐵笛其所，客和小海之歌，不異扣舷者之為，中無他長物，唯琴瑟筆研，多者書與畫耳。（楊維楨東維子文集書畫舫記）　　至正庚子四月，黃鶴山人岳榆，偕翟文仲自吳城拏舟至海虞，復過過崑山，訪顧仲瑛於草堂，值春暉樓前芍藥盛開，仲瑛置酒樓上，是夕雷雨新霽，風月淡蕩，趙善長折金帶豳一朶插瓶中，又以紅白競繞攢簇。朱伯盛督行酒令，共集者七人，陳墓於立暨伯盛善長先醉，仲瑛謂人事雖艱，天時自適，友朋盍簪，寗無一語，以紀行樂乎？遂取紅藥當階翻」句，分韻賦詩。（徐傳詩星湄詩話）　　至芷乙未十月二十九日，玉山中玉毬花開，飲酒花下，時琴川妓秀雲在焉，詩有「美人笑解金條脫，獨樹花開玉繡球。」（顧瑛玉山璞稿）　　瑛素有石癖，凡過　園壞宅，見奇峯怪石，輒徘徊顧戀，不忍捨去。或百計求之不得者，必圖寫其形似，標諸　堂壁間，以為几格供。（鮑廷博輯玉山逸稿）小西天  張恨水著　　第二十一回　婉轉依人過庭憐月貌激昂訓壻隔室聽獅聲　　那婦人就喝了一聲道，不用得混扯，我沒有到過甘肅，我在書上也看到過的，決不能像蒙古一樣，滿地都是沙漠吧？就算是沙漠，我也要去。那局長就用極低的聲晉，答應了三個字，那很好。這一幕隔壁戲，到了這時，才算告一段落。過了許久，程志前才乾了一身汗，帶着微笑坐了下來，向北海點了兩點頭。北海笑道：這倒有趣，剛剛趁個反比例。志前笑道：這就趁那句時髦話，一切都以經濟為背景。大家都是為了經濟而屈服。北海再要向下說時，隔壁屋子裏，吱咯吱咯，咳嗽了許多聲。兩個人就不再提到這件事了。北海沉默着坐了一會，便又想到前面院了裏那個月英，因道：程先生，不是我多管閑事，前面院子裏那位朱姑娘，我想總還可以想一點法子吧？話說到這裏，臉也跟着就紅了，伸手摸摸頭，伸手又摸摸臉子，好像不知乎足放到什麼所在才好的樣子。志　覺着他已經是很難堪的，不能再敎他難為情了，便道：有是有怯子想，不過我們出外之人，怎好干涉到人家的婚姻問題上去？志前隨　說了這樣一個答案，意思是給他敷衍面子的，實在說不出一個具體辦法來的。北河很是高興，望了他笑道：程先生說是有辦法，那一定是有辦法的。但不知道是怎樣一個辦法？我們就是不能干涉人家的婚姻問題，私人提出來研究研究，那似乎也不怎麼要緊。（三六七）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊醫學講座療淋法之種種  陳培基醫師　　在昔療淋之法。除對症的投以内服劑外。僅行局部洗滌之法。此法痛苦多而收獲少。現今雖仍然應用是法。但藥液之新頴。已非昔比。近今所最倡導者。在電器療法中。厥為治急性淋之最新療濁機及治慢性淋之短波透熱電療機為最有確效。前者以光力殺菌。後者以電力熱力殺菌。施用短波透熱電療機時。隔衣可以療治。尤為稱便。在藥劑治療法中。當推混合淋苗及色素。一以透膜殺菌。一以自動免疫。相兼互用。收效亦佳。内服之藥劑中。尤以有强力之殺菌消毒止痛除炎而不碍内臟者為上。如美靈洋行之「滅殺淋」然MESALTROPIN。該藥除能奏滅淋之效外。復能恢復尿道粘膜之發炎部分。是以醫家多甚樂用。局部治療之藥劑。現時最賞用者為「可拉窪兒」。以其能滲透粘膜。而無損於粘膜。殺菌之効力。亦頗準確。然猶不及最近德國滿爾志大藥廠岀品之以「淋病血淸與舒樂耳製成之「淋毒舒樂耳」GONO-SEROL為優。此藥根據自動免疫之意義。其效力並不遜於伐克辛之注射。若病變僅在尿道部時。奏效尤宏。老友馮善樑先生所主持之春在醫院。對於上述諸般療淋法。設置均全。聘有男女醫師。分别擔任。備有各項電械。收費極廉。久譽春申。（滅殺淋及淋毒舒樂耳。均歸本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售。前者每盒一元。後者每盒二元五角。）為有煙癮者進一言  余雷醫師　　當今政府嚴厲禁煙之日。有阿芙蓉癖者。靡不亟思戒除。紛投醫生之門而就戒。然畏懼不前。而任意圖苟安者。恐亦大有人在試推有煙癮者所以徘徊懼戒的心理。無非深恐一旦就戒。不但煙癮未曾全除。反而陡增其他疾患。或疑慮痛苦。或恐有危生命。世俗對於戒煙恐怖之傳説。已深印人心。有不可即拔之勢。未戒之前。熟思再三。就戒以後。誠惶誠恐。偶或於戒煙經過中。因天時飲食之不慎防擇。而致有極輕度之身體違和情形等。則懷疑戒煙之有痛苦。滋生疾患。有危生命。因而再吸。比比然也。夫雅片固能障蔽疾病。在漸除煙癮之際。可能復現。然則醫生替人戒煙。等於替人治病一樣。豈徒施戒法而不予内體之調理者。要凡精於内科之醫生。俱能妥為戒除。而臻完善之境。有謂戒煙須量體格。有的人碍能施戒。據個人所知。如嚴重之肺結核患者。本來垂死可待。自是未可予戒。此外凡在病後。尤以年事長者為甚。指體力未恢復而言。則任何人不宜即戒。因在除癮期間。必使就戒者。得能增進體力而後可。總之。戒煙勝如治病。謹慎擇醫。固在必要。戒絶决心。不可不具。否則。縱有良醫。亦屬枉然。（本篇作者余雷先生。乃余之老友也。精歧黄。善戒煙。經其妙手脱離黑籍者。莫可計數。謝函盈尺。口碑載道。彼對於戒煙原理。宏文卓論。特具見地。疊見報章。毋庸介紹。現臨診於本埠法租界甯波路六六號春在醫院。編者）。談白濁内服藥滅殺淋  蔣國藩醫師　　近世白濁之治療。不論急性慢性。或與有合併者。率分内服與外治兩種。外用藥近今醫家都採用「淋毒舒樂耳」GONO-SEROL。奏效宏速。世所公認。亦毋煩喋喋。内服藥。常用尿液消毒劑。及一種芳香油。名白爾散謨者。市上所售之此類内服藥。名目雖異。實其内容。多屬此類。因性質簡單。其效力自難完全。惟此「滅殺淋」藥片MESALTROPIN。為美靈種治尿道疾患之貴重原料。配合而成。為美靈洋行極岀之品。功能利尿消毒。收歛消腫。安神止痛。其中除强有力之尿路消毒劑外。醋基化柳酸。及安息香酸之成分。能使淋病疾患之鹼性尿液變成酸性。由是淋菌。易於死滅。他如單溴化樟腦。為鎮靜神經之良藥。特於性神經為更甚。安甯尿道之筋肉。尿道内一切急性痛楚與刺激。可厭之陰莖勃起性疼痛。及遺精。悉可為之除去。滅殺淋含此種藥物精。良品質之功效。治於一爐。其能收空前治淋良效。自在意中。近世醫家謂本品為最有效之内服白濁丸。全尿道消毒劑中之最完美者。洵非虚語。今將其治療領域。介紹於后。俾國人之患斯疾者。得所採擇也。「滅殺淋」能制服淋菌外。凡尿道痛楚。無分男女。皆得消除净盡。對於各種腎臟炎。膀胱炎。皆俱寄效。胃疾漫談  （孫志耀醫生）　　我人之身體。其所以能得相當滋養而得以維持生命之健康者。全賴乎一日三餐之食物。食物的攝取消化。胥藉乎胃。胃臟就是專司消化食物。製造營業成份的機器。設一旦胃臟偶有任何疾患。消化必蒙其影響。身體就日漸衰弱。疾病也因此容易傳染。我們欲身體之康强。第一條件。必使胃無疾患。胃病的普遍症候。大概以胃痛為多。即俗謂肝胃氣痛。胃痛的原因。除因精神感動所致的神經性胃痛外。蓋皆基因於胃酸過多。上海法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售之「胃寶」WEABO。對於胃痛一症有特殊的功效。能中和胃酸。使胃内的酸素至適當度存留而無過劑之弊。同時還能塗着胃壁。得以保障胃粘膜。且並不妨害胃液的分泌。其對於神經性胃痛。又能迅速達止痛寧靜之效。藥性極和平。不含鴉片嗎啡等麻醉藥品。即使常服。亦無流弊。「滅絶菌」之藥效  袁一民醫師　　治療皮膚病之藥品。美不勝收。但求其完美而有確效者。亦屬鮮少。要知適宜應用皮膚疾患之藥劑。必須具有如下之條件者。方可稱為優良之品。（一）殺菌力强而絲毫無損於皮膚。（二）消除患處之痛感及癢感。（三）不因皮膚之吸收而害及内臟。（四）須無厭惡之氣味。不致汚及衣被。如是庶可謂美善。「滅絶菌」為皮膚疾患之優良製劑。凡疥癬。頑癬。濕疥。癢疹等等。用之無不立收神效。其殺菌力之强。能深入皮膚層而奏其宏偉之神效。且絲毫無損於皮膚面與夫内臟。至於痛疼瘙癢。搽擦一次。所苦若失。且其氣味芬芳。絶無汚及衣被之虞。該項藥品。為為埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售良藥之一。性神經衰弱之治療  馮善樑醫師　　所謂性神經衰弱。即性神經容易興奮。也容易疲勞之謂。在初步時。患者自己所感覺到的。如遺精。早洩等情形。俗謂精關不固。其實或來自攝䕶腺弛緩。或來自腰髓射中樞神經呈過敏性故也。此種症候。固為神經衰弱的一部分現象。可以行神經衰弱的一般療法。但性神經衰弱未必兼有腦神經衰弱。病患僅在局部。是以局部的療法。亦屬緊要。雷文非特氏謂「電氣療法為神經性陰萎不可或缺的治療法。本症雖為神經衰弱的一部分現象。但生殖器領域有任何障碍時。一般療法。自不易澈底治愈。非施以局部電氣療法不可。此理甚明。」診斷本症時。務必不厭求詳。仔細診察。問診自屬必要。應確知其障碍在腰椎部或攝䕶腺部。然後適應施術。自收良效。用於性神經衰弱之藥物。非常之多。臟器療法。似最適宜於此目的。來豈丁。番木鼈有强壯神經系統的功能頗為稱揚。催春劑亦屬賞用。在神經衰弱的一般療法。則「安爾神」AROLSEN殊有相當之價值。該藥屢經施用。對於遺精有驚人之速效。（編者按，「安爾神」為本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售良藥之一。每盒僅售一元五角。可服旬日云。）介紹良醫  編者　　德籍醫學博士「海斯俄夫康」DR.WOLGGANG,HESS。精治婦科對於婦科手術。敏捷老到。歷任中國各大醫院婦科主任。昔年在華北時。聲譽久著。其所著之婦科學。亦為醫界同人及各醫藥團體所贊道。彼蒞華既久。對於我國人之體質情形。處方施藥。亦無隔闋之弊。聞現為滬上名醫馮善樑氏所邀請。每日下午二時至四時。在本埠法租界甯波路六六號春在醫院二樓應診。誠我國婦女界之福音也。醫學消息　　上海法租界甯波路六十六號號春在醫院為海上名醫馮善樑先生主持。設備完善。為滬上冠。醫務方面。特聘德國籍醫學博士「HESS」。專治一切内外皮膚花柳全科。並聘有國民政府註册醫師。如内科佘雷。外科花柳皮膚科專家崔馥卿。婦科子宫疾患女醫生劉玄及助理醫生孫志耀。鄭志舫。何鎮東等。並備有世界最新各種電療器械。如真空管短波透熱電療機。一九三五年式最新療濁機。新式人工太陽燈。無須摇擺。即能發光。其紫外線之光度較普通强。水銀石英燈。蘇魯克司燈及富爾國電療機等。注射及一切手術等費。從廉收取。設有戒烟專科。備有雅室。凡戒烟法至為新頴。戒費又極低廉。每日注射及内服藥費在内。共計兩元。該院門診上午八時至下午八時止。僅收小洋六角。岀診五元。另加車資。電話八一八九八。星期照常。　　上海法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售各國馳名良藥。功效確實。而猶以治頑瘡惡癬之皮膚病藥「滅絶菌」MISUIYINE治神經衰弱之「安爾神」AROLSEN治神經性胃痛及胃加答兒之「胃寶」WEABO淋病内服聖藥滅殺淋MESALTROPIN及淋病外用藥之淋毒舒樂耳TONO-SEROL等為更見神效。疊經滬上名醫臨證使用。每奏良效。疾病問答　　本刋闢此一欄。凡有疾病上之疑問。均可投函垂詢。自當負責具體答覆。來函須將病情及治療經過等。扼要説明。寄上海郵政信箱一六六八號本刋編輯部。如不願在本刊上披露。而須書面答覆者。本埠請附復件郵資二分。外埠五分。　　陳良君鍳　試搽「滅絶菌」MISULYINE。該藥乃皮膚病患中最優良之製劑。每盒售洋一元。本埠永安先施西藥部南京路南洋五洲藥房四馬路中西藥房及西門和平路華成藥房等均有岀售。　　張耀逸君　包皮疾患非淋病也。用硼酸水洗滌使其乾燥即可。對於遺精。可服「安爾神」ROLSEN。該藥每盒一元五角。本埠南京路南洋五洲四馬路中西西門和平路華成等大藥房均有岀售。　　馬之駸君　尊恙係神經衰弱。試服安爾神AROLSEN為荷。談言取締播音荒謬節目  家為　　據昨日報載「新聲社云：本市社會局現謀取締無綫電荒謬節目，昨承該局第四科長張秉輝詳告各情如下：本市自有無綫電播音以來，各商店即利用以作誇大宣傳。甚且為迎合低級趣味起見，各電台往往播送荒誕之節目，如頽廢等「哭……」及下流卑汚不堪入耳之小調，諸如此類，對於民族前途，養成頽䘮風氣，影響非小，殊堪痛恨，本局有鍳於此，認為非取締不足以振頽風而遏潛禍，故慎重斟酌之下，採取迅速處置……」　　本來！「什麽東西來了中國要變樣」這原為一般人所公認着。什麽政治上，哲學上，文學上等的問題不去講，單就這無綫電播音台來説，就是個例子。世界各國都用以作為教育上的新工具—實施教育播音，而在我們却成了有閒者羣日夜的「消遣品」。當然，既是有「閒」要「消」，那末，「尋開心」，「找娱樂」；才是需要這樣，無綫電台播送節目的要流入於「趣味化」，那是必然的趨勢了。　　而且，在今日，誰都知道，無綫電播音台是被利用為一般公司，商店的宣傳工具，各無綫電台的以此營利而成了商業化，也是事實。這樣為招徠顧客，作誇大宣傳，而迎合一般「低級趣味」的聽衆，也正是不可避免的事實！　　至於趣味的要成為「低級」，却也是我們社會的「本色」。什麽彈詞説書，文明戲，蹦蹦戲等的備受歡迎；而稍有社會理論而嚴正些的電影，戲劇等的反被人漠視，是很平常的事。而且，在播音台上，我們常可以聽見有某公司聘某「滑稽家」播送節目的報告説：「××路×公館來電話要求唱」「哭××」」活捉…」等，正説明了一般聽衆的。「趣味」。　　不過，這些原是不無社會根據的。時代不斷地進展，社會正跟着變演；老古的社會，受着物質文明的洗禮——變，變，新，新，吸收着外來的「文明」。然而，在内里，在我們社會的意識形態上，正深潛着，包羅着幾千年來的「封建殘餘」。同時，社會文化水準的一般地低落；更由於没落的有閒者羣的一味享樂，而苦悶底小市民階級層的尋求神經的刺激跟麻醉等等，都是造成今日「趣味低級化」底主要原因。　　現在，當局果然對於這些「非取締不足以振頽風而遏潛禍的低級趣味底乖謬節目」，「已具有堅毅决心而加以迅速處置了」。想不久將見諸事實而收巨效啦！不過，當局若單謀「取締」而不從於起因上着手，那末正像在一個骯髒惡臭的泥沼上打撈了浮面的沉渣而謀其澄淸是一樣地永不會澈底，吧！舅父  英光軍　　「我的舅父好，你們的舅父呢」？　　小時候，和一帮小朋友在一起玩耍時，時常就想起舅父來，到那時就不自主地要這麽樣問别人了。回答的話，自然是各不相同的，有人説自己舅父好的，有人説自己的舅父不好，還有人説他自己的舅父不好也不壞的，不好或是不好也不壞的舅父那自然不在話下，對於那稱説自己舅父好的人，我總給他作岀不任任的神情來，我還會頗不為然地説：　　「你説瞎話，你的舅父一定不會像你説的那樣好，你的舅父一定没有我的舅父好。」　　對方的人自然也不肯服軟，就算都是小孩子，也全知道為自己説過話争取體面，那結果可想而知是要有着争吵的。然而這事情是吵不岀青紅皂的的，正像你猜不透究竟是鷄先生蛋還是蛋先生鷄的一樣，到後來，只有弄得不歡而散。　　舅父實在是個好舅父，這就是使我到現在遠深深記憶着他不能忘去的主因。彷彿現在眼睛一閉，舅父已經來在我的眼前了。　　那時候，我們家里還過着大家庭的生活呢，一家里的孩子們很多，别個作母親的手頭都富裕，只有母親手里没有存項，她岀嫁的一些錢欵，都讓父親抽大烟硬搶去還欠賬了。看見别人孩子買零嘴吃，自己就饞得恨不淌岀口水來，但怨父親不好，累得我們享不到一點口福。幸得舅父每次來一回，必定背着父親送給母親一點零錢，他指明這是給我們留作買零嘴吃的，於是我同哥哥和妹妹的嘴里就常久有零東西吃了，不至於讓别個孩子吃零食饞得往外流口水了。　　然而最使我不忘記舅父的地方，那就是他提倡我進學校這一回事。那時候，我們的全鎮才立學堂，大人們還不信任呢，依舊把孩子送到私塾里去。這是舅父的見識比一般人不同的地方，現在想起來很着人佩服。　　「送學堂里去罷，没有錢，到我這里來拿，官學堂念畢業能有個好事情作，念私塾有什麽用，也不是考翰林狀元的時代！切不要死抱一條路跑到黑。」　　我還記得他那時督促母親的話。舅父本意，大概希望學堂里多念幾年，畢岀業可以升官發財光宗耀祖吧，若是現在他還知道我這官學堂里畢了好幾次業的學生，一點事情也作不到，該不知怎樣失悔憤慨呢。也許他還要痛惜自己當年的失計。　　母親聽信了舅父的話，却因此和父親起了衝突，父親一方面懷疑官學堂，一方面説家里，孩子全讀私塾，我們不能開這先例，但讓母親撞回去了，她憤憤地又是認真地説：　　「不用你管這件事，你自己還没有管好你自己呢。什麽先例不先例的，没有化你們家里的錢，就不聽家人管！我一定要送！」　　舅父如果是個有錢的人，那他對於我們的關切和施惠倒不足為奇了，實在他家中也只是僅維持生活罷了，記得有一年閙旱災，他家糧米不收，那年冬</p>

<p>天的常有上頓没有下頓的。舅父的情况並不好，但他却這樣關心我們，資助我們，怎能不呌我説他是個好舅父呢。怎能叫我輕易忘了他呢。　　他也非常愛喜我們，每逢來一次，總要化費一點時間領着我們玩，親着嘴，問長問短説些笑話，有時還講有趣的故事，引得我們發笑不止。那時我由於對父親的不滿，當真在暗想：「為什麽舅父就不是父親呢。有舅父這樣的父親真够好了。」　　不幸我這位好舅父的老境太壞，不但家境淸寒，連自己僅有的幾間茅屋也因負債被累賣掉了，幾年未回家，可不知他的日子都是怎樣過的。山㘭裏  沈塢　　剛探進了山㘭，路就狹隘了許多，大淸早趕路要總不免有點寒意大家咬緊了牙根，抖抖震震的摸索着走。滿天的霧把山峯迷漫着，看不見天，也看不見太陽；兩旁的山峯高聳地從地上矗立，顯得異常之險峻，陰深而且怕人。兩條腿竄在亂草里，息息率率的移動，不時把草上的露珠攪散了，落在自己的腿上，濕潤潤的，有點刺骨的冷意，使人感到非常的難受，也增加了寒氣對我們的體温的襲擊。　　山㘭里的黄茅長得很高，黑色而龐大的岩石，奇形怪狀的在亂草，山麓之間突岀頭來，有時會使人疑心它是什麽山鼠（賊之别稱）或野獸之類的隱伏，在心頭里不免浮起一些驚駭恐懼的思感。聰明或老到一點的伙伴，到這里唯一的安慰，就是把緊了一桿冷硬的槍，眼睛直望前面，以防自己的畏怯；一面念了一百二十四遍的符咒，反正什麽都是命定的。這麽着，好像什麽都不放在心上，迷迷糊糊的就從狹道上竄過了。　　突過山㘭，轉岀前面那大坪山的路，就是一片大盤地，在山間有這樣的路好走，已經是非常之難得了，何况那兒還有要攤（路上的小灘，俗呌路攤）呢。走了半天的路，到路攤那兒也該歇歇了，可是路兒總不是那樣好走，好像螞蟻拉螳螂，好容易才把山㘭里的路走了一半。　　望望前面那樣大槐樹的影，我們漸漸有㸃兒欣喜了。黄貓兒扯扯竹老頭的衣角，像要告訴他這個可喜的消息，然而他抬起那雙模糊的老花眼，卻什麽也看不見。　　「真是呢，一上了年紀眼睛就没用了！」他把頭回轉來朝我們這幾個年青的伙子看了一眼，好似對自己有無限的歎息。回過頭來又對黄貓兒説：「你打仗見了槐花樹就到了麽？孩子，還遠呢！那影子畢竟是哄人的哪，小伙子們總不大懂事，此方這槐花樹高，老遠就看見了，可是你卻走得氣都喘了，恐怕還没走到呢，像我這樣有了一把年紀的人，真是不大容易！小伙子，這株槐花樹正跟掛在墻頭里哄狗玩的猪肉一樣，光是騙人歡喜的吧了，你想是不是？——」　　老頭子話一停，大家愕然地朝那槐花樹的影子望。太陽這時已經從山巒重疊中放岀一綫光明的影子來，然而在羣山的懷抱中，除非到了中午，我們真不容易看到太陽的臉。霧氣在太陽的浩氣中漸漸霏散，天空也顯得半壁淸朗了。竹老頭抬起了那張蒼老而瘦削的臉，好像觸起了一些什麽，也不知是向誰，嘮嘮叨叨的又説了一大堆話：　　「年紀青青總會有岀頭的，路正長呢！你們恐怕一輩子也走不完。只是我就没用了，上了這把年紀還要趕，一輩子做奴才，死没岀息。看看日子快要完了，還有什麽想頭？……路走得爛熟，只是苦了一世啦！……要是明兒這們有了岀頭，總不要忘了我才好，就是做了鬼也好給我多燒點紙錢，積德的！……」　　然而誰也没有聽他的嘮叨話，腿上的露水給風吹乾了。太陽漸漸把熱度增加了起來，似乎是中午了，從山㘭間已經看到太陽的臉，大家抖了抖精神，身邊也没有剛才那樣寒冷，可是肚子卻乾癟得很。為了要把肚子充實起來，大家只得用點勁兒越過了槐花樹，趕上大盤地去。可是一到大盆地的路攤，我們都氣喘得要命，竹老頭落在後面，看看他喘急的神色，和那蹣跚的步子，越發顯得他的蒼老和可怪，我們不禁後悔剛才那樣冷落地不理睬他的話。議親  沈千里　　（一）　　土磚牆的茅屋裏坐滿了人，烟霧迷漫了一屋，靠在東牆端一張舖上，横趟着一個乾魚似的中年紳士，嘴裏吐着一口白烟圏，兩隻眼珠子擠在一道正自瞧得岀神；下面坐的一些人，便都看着他那得意的神情媚笑了。　　「潤翁，可算得是一位陸地神仙了。」　　「這也是前世修來的，不容易！」接着又是一陣轟笑。　　中年紳士聽了這恭維的頌辭，却很胸有城府地横掃了大家一眼，隨手把一截半寸來長烟庇股朝地上一摜，這才閃動兩片乾癟的嘴唇，微微地向大家表示一下感謝的笑容。　　「諸位都以為我很無愛無慮過着日子，其實，唉！其實我一天到晚把全副的精神用在家務事上，家裏還是弄不認淸，咳！假如能够擺脱的話，我早擺脱了！」兩隻手作了個捧東西的樣子，似乎恨不得馬上便能够擺脱才好。　　「哈哈……這所謂「治家猶如治國」，潤翁如果不道岀這篇宏論，我們準一輩子也不曉得管一個大家的難處。」又是一陣磔磔地像貓頭呌似的笑起來。　　「可不是麽？我要不説岀來，誰也不會明白我的苦處；咳！」猛然像想起什麽似的，兩隻净圓的眼珠子霎時挺得白果一樣，朝屋子四週溜了一遍，臉上的顔色便不似剛才那麽地喜悦了；「雲兒又跑到那裏去了？怎麽她見了我來這裏，老是坐不住？」左腿猛地放下一沉，一骨碌身子便坐了起來，似乎想跑岀去找她的樣子。　　她剛才不是還坐在那裏麽？」坐在紳士對面的雲英媽，忙滿臉堆着笑把他按捺坐下了；「怎麽這大的年紀，還是這麽性急？」雲英媽説罷，意識地朝雲英坐的地方望了一望，心裏不免也有些急了。　　「哈哈！怪不得我打發人來説幾次，你還是不肯給我一個滿意的答復，原來你還是嫌我年紀大了，不好做你的女婿呀？紳士虎着滿臉怒氣。」　　「她不過是那末順口説一句罷了，那裏會當真嫌你老了；這真是她的福氣，别人恐怕求你做她的女婿你還不肯哩！哈哈！潤翁！我這話不錯罷？」　　「我已曉得她不敢真説，我不過逗她玩玩罷了。」一支烟又剛剛吸着，似乎　雲英總有點不放心的樣子：「你不用坐在這裏，快去把她找回！」脚在雲英媽身上點了一點，她便好像機器撥動了機關似的站起來，走去了。　　（二）　　靜寂的夜幕中，母女倆個站在道塲裏抽泣着；屋裏面傳來一陣陣的笑聲，倆人的心上便感着刀子戳着般的疼痛。　　「兒，你聽我的話罷？不要再執拗了，你多留難一次，我便多吃一回苦頭啊！」雲英媽緊緊挨着她，一面勸説，自己也忍不住一面流下淚來。　　「他那麽大的年紀，討了四五個女人在家裏還不够，還要想那種死心眼兒，謀我去做他的玩意兒，我偏不如他的心願，看他把我吃下去不成？」説罷，兩隻脚一跥，好像能够這一脚就把他埋在地下去，才覺痛快。　　「好兒，莫那樣拗性罷，給他聽見了又是晦氣！剛才你跑岀來一會兒，他就發脾氣了，逼着我岀來找你，好像怕你逃跑了似的；我瞧着他那股勁兒，又是氣又是笑。咳！我活了這大年紀，也没見過那樣死心眼兒的人！兒，聼我的話，進去，進去答應了他罷！」她一面替女兒揩了眼淚，一面又替自己揩了揩：「兒，不要哭，他看到你眼紅，又要説那種「捨不得情人」的話來嘔你！」　　「他也一個人啊！媽，你何必要那樣的怕他？」不服氣似的把頭一偏。（未完）播音歌曲介紹　　賣孩子　　（一）誰人要買喲！誰人要買喲！兩個孩子便宜點賣！留在我此地難免不餓壞，且讓你兩個找個好地方待，給你們兩個尋找個快樂所在，鮮肉鮮魚儘你們吃兩三大塊，襖褲夾袍兒都是新裁，挺旺的大火爐够烤個痛快。待長够歳數，要給你們娶上兩個奶奶，喝！兩位少奶奶。　　（二）跟這大爺去！跟這大娘去！兩個孩子可别恐惶！做事要勤快，不可荒唐，别像娘懷裏嬌生長慣裏養。教你們倆該怎樣，就得怎樣，得呌人家爹和媽不許胡亂講，晚嚮不許哭，親娘不許想，有什麽可想的窮死的親娘！幹嗎？這樣拉呀扯呀哭得眼淚汪汪去！我得揍兩巴掌。特别節目　　孔雀歌唱社　　華興（一二六○）下午一時三刻至二時半　　賣油條　（劉琳）　　告别南洋　（戴萍）　　妹妹我怪你　（納聖）　　特别快軍　（劉琳）　　女軍人歌　（鄭霞）　　和平歌　（靜美）　　路柳牆花　（莉亞）　　小小茉莉　（戴萍）　　離别了姑娘　（納聖）歌唱　　虹光歌詠社　　東陸（六四○）下午五時至五時三刻　　今夜曲　（許玲玲）　　雙摇船　（金儀）　　一封快信　（許玲玲）　　紅燒丈夫　（金儀）　　銀漢雙星　（莉亞）　　擱樓上小姐　（鄭霞）　　窮富姻縁　（莉亞）　　醉臥沙塲　（鄭霞）　　上海歌劇社　　新新（七八○）下午七時至八時　　鮮花新婚　（周璇）　　倚江樓　（秋影）　　和平歌　（徐健）　　蘇武牧羊　（周潔）　　鸞鳯引　（秋影）　　永别了弟弟　（周璇）　　努力　（周潔）　　賣花詞　（徐健）　　李樹德堂（九四○）下午九時至十時　　可憐的秋香　（周璇）　　愛的徬徨　（秋影）　　開始的一吻　（徐健）　　王女士的鷄　（周潔）　　娘子軍　（秋影）　　風雨歸舟　（周璇）　　野草閒花　（徐健）　　因為你　（徐健）　　芙蓉團　　東陸（六四○）下午七時一刻至八時　　昏狂　（雪雪）　　花生米　（雪琦）　　因為你　（雪露）　　夜花園裏　（雪雪）　　夜深深　（雪琦）　　努力　（雪露）　　漢音歌詠社　　上海（一一○○）下午七時半至八時一刻　　我要你的一切　（漢璇）　　永别了弟弟　（漢琳）　　我們的皇后　（漢璇）　　航空救國　（漢琦）　　摩登戀愛　（漢瓊）　　紅燒丈夫　（漢璐）　　大同歌劇社　　興（一二六○）下午七時三刻至八時半　　薔薇之蕊　（姚莉）　　梅花接老爺　（王琪）　　説愛就愛　（姚莉）（林鶯）　　航空救國　（戴萍）　　甜密的夢　（王琪）　　睡的贊美　（林鶯）　　永别了弟　（戴萍）　　丁香社　　東陸（六四○）下午八時至八時三刻　　鸞鳯引　　晚香玉　（樂影）　　五月花　（姚莉）　　小東西　（緑茵）　　花想容　（姚英）　　别離情　（姚莉）　　今夜曲　（緑茵）　　圈兒信　（姚英）　　大上海社　　大中華（一一六○）八時半至九時一刻　　月下花前　（文仙）　　凱旋歌　（飛亞）　　梅花接老爺　（飛虹）　　圏兒信　（曼麗）　　蘇武牧羊　（莫竇）　　我要你一切　（飛亞）　　粉紅色的夢　（文仙）　　姊妹花　（飛虹）　　華美（一○六○）下午九時至十時　　愛情是什麽　（飛亞）　　城市之光　（莫竇）　　永遠親愛　（文仙）　　蝶戀花　（飛虹）　　紅頭新詩　（曼麗）　　船夫曲　（飛亞）　　知音之愛　（文仙）　　兹母摇籃曲　（飛虹）彈詞　　夏荷生三笑　　敦本（八○○）下午七時至八時　　開篇「嘆五更」　　靜聽醮樓一鼓敲。娘娘獨坐淚雙抛。只為，兒夫岀外無消息。行踪不定在那裏跑。莫不是，他鄉别戀多情女。更比奴奴才學高。因此上，消息沉沉難捉摸。害奴家，坐聽二鼓氣難消。良人呀，想你臨行説得天花墜。説甚麽，一到京中就揮毫。好音兒傳達美多姣。可憐奴，偏候書信信不到。又好比，風筝斷綫音息香。三更過。四更交。奴是形單影隻意蕭條。家呀。可憐奴，愁腸百結恨難消。娘娘是，長吁短嘆少顧問。那凄凉苦境更難描。噯……郎君呀。假使你，抛不下，多情多義多姣羊。也可携歸共一巢。兩馬不妨合同槽。奴奴决不生嫉忌。姊妹相呼樂陶陶。恨只恨，郎心不如奴心意。空留好意匿人嘈。苦只苦，夜長夢短難消遣，只聽見，城樓隱隱五鼓敲。一聲兒低。一聲兒高。一聲兒遠。又一聲兒飄。聲聲相應哭牢騷。如此凄凉如此過。娘娘更覺苦無聊。騫聽見，四壁蟲聲如泣。嘆五更哭壞了美多姣。憑你鐵打心腸也動摇。話劇　　時代歌劇播音社　　佛音（九八○）下午五時三刻至六時半　　「小氣鬼」　　慳吝人嬪女兒想不要嫁妝自己討小太太希望帶一萬兩千塊錢來，那兒知道，小氣鬼的小太太原來就是他的兒媳婦，媒婆把那女孩子領來了，當塲笑話托岀。　　中西（一○四○）下午七時至八時　　「美人恩」　　洪士毅自從中暑後，被慈善會救到醫院裏，可是常小南不但不去探望他，而且滿腔希望他快些死去，常有德却看不過去，命自己的妻子余民去看望他，洪士毅這時已經將痊愈，預備岀醫院了。美術　　毛執中美術講習座　　航業（一一八○）下午五時半至六時一刻　　「國畫的虚與實」　　唐人真蹟，二者兼長細如游絲，匀如鐵綫，靮勤之道。五日一水，十日一石，渲染之工，著乎墨法。（二）教中西畫</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The traitor Yin Rugeng organized a puppet autonomous association in Tongzhou and declared independence, betraying the nation, a heinous crime, abandoning humanity. The National Government issued a special decree on the evening of the 26th, ordering the Executive Yuan to immediately instruct the Hebei Provincial Government to remove and arrest him to nip the rebellion in the bud. The original decree is as follows: In recent years, the nation has faced many difficulties and frequent calamities. The reliance is on the unity and solidarity of the national people, enduring hardships and sharing difficulties. All those with conscience deeply understand justice. Hebei is a strategically important area, and its stability is particularly important. People from all walks of life have been able to persevere and maintain self-control in order to support the situation. The slightest change in the situation can affect the overall safety and security. Especially for public officials, who have specific responsibilities, how should they further inspire their conscience, dedicate their wisdom, and loyally protect the country together? However, it has been found that Yin Rugeng, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Ao-Yu District of Hebei Province, presumptuously declared on the 25th of this month the establishment of the Hebei-East Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, making himself the chairman, colluding with traitors, and attempting to betray the country. Amidst the nation's difficulties, he took the opportunity to disrupt the situation, losing his mind, abandoning humanity, and going so far as this. The traitor Yin Rugeng is to be immediately removed from his post by the Executive Yuan and the Hebei Provincial Government, strictly arrested, and punished according to law. All Administrative Inspector Commissioners of the Luan-Yu-Ji-Mi districts are to be immediately removed, and all their duties are to be directly handled by the Hebei Provincial Government to quickly suppress the rebellion and consolidate public will.

<h3>Expectations for Industrial and Commercial Lending</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Before the implementation of the new monetary policy, industry and commerce were eagerly hoping for monetary reform. Now, less than a month after implementation, industry and commerce are anxious and uneasy because they have not seen the desired results. Initially, they believed that once reforms were made, it would not be difficult to obtain huge amounts of funds and achieve recovery. However, they did not consider that the change in monetary policy was only the first step in the plan, and the development of industrial and commercial enterprises still depended on the efforts of all parties. Taking domestic goods factories as an example, they usually do not prepare for self-sufficiency in raw materials, but instead specialize in selling imported goods for convenience and profit. Now that exchange rates are high and raw material prices have risen, purchasing power cannot be increased immediately, and selling prices cannot keep up. This is indeed a fact that is difficult to avoid at present, and industry and commerce are well aware of it. Knowing this, they are negligent in seeking solutions themselves, only hoping that raw material merchants will not raise prices too quickly. Is this possible?</p>
<p>I believe that industry and commerce should examine and improve themselves. For example, if one yarn factory can make a profit while another loses money, the reason for the failure is often not seeking advancement in production and management, but knowing only to seek windfall profits from speculative markets. When speculation fails, the enterprise follows suit. If the spirit and financial resources used for speculation could be used to improve the enterprise and obtain raw materials, why would today's failure occur?</p>
<p>The intention to curb the bad habit of speculation and concentrate funds on production is certainly good. However, if increasing the number of chips in the market is not used appropriately, it may further fuel speculation. Therefore, we should investigate the root cause of why speculation can occur and make a plan to address the root of the problem, rather than focusing on the disposal of the object of speculation and adding to the confusion.</p>
<p>What industry and commerce are still hoping for is how to get banks to accept the mortgage of their products, securities, and real estate to provide them with working capital. It is important to know that the current monetary policy is a method of concentrating cash without redemption, which still requires a 60% cash reserve, unlike the paper money policy, which can be over-issued without limit. Although using existing silver coins as a reserve at a price of one shilling and two and a half pence per yuan can increase issuance considerably, it is still necessary to adjust according to supply and demand; otherwise, it will be inflation. Moreover, even if the issuance of paper money can be increased, it is questionable whether it will be sufficient to meet the needs of industry and commerce, whether it can reduce market interest rates, and whether it can recover high-interest bonds. If a large amount of paper money suddenly enters the market, although it is said that banks can regulate it, one act of carelessness can lead to significant abuses. Therefore, industry and commerce should not blame banks for not immediately expanding credit, but should ask how credit should be expanded. They should not only blame others for not helping them, but should know that only those who help themselves can be helped by others. At this critical juncture, cooperation from all parties is necessary to have hope of recovery. Industry and commerce should know how to exert themselves.</p>
<h3>Important Figures of the Hebei-East Pseudo-Autonomous Committee Discussed Matters All Day; Sent Personnel to Beiping, Tianjin, and Other Places to Contact Everything; Implemented the Takeover of Tax Revenue Agencies in Various Counties in the War Zone; Zhao Announced Joint Action with Yin Rugeng; Magistrate Yuan Tai and Others of Linyu County Have Resigned and Gone to the Province</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the establishment of the Hebei-East Pseudo-Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, the first committee meeting was held yesterday afternoon, attended by Chairman Yin Rugeng and all members, to discuss military, political, financial, security, and other issues in the war zone. Yin and important figures of the committee are currently staying in Tongzhou to plan everything. The Tax Revenue Committee will start implementing the takeover of various tax revenue agencies in the war zone today and will issue a notice to retain land taxes in each county. Yesterday afternoon, the committee sent Huo Shi, director of the Foreign Affairs Department, to Beiping, and Yin Tixin, member and director of the Tangshan Office, to Tianjin to report the establishment of the committee to the Japanese Embassy and the Japanese Garrison Headquarters respectively. At the same time, Wang Xiacai, director of construction and education, was sent to Beiping to visit Chen Juesheng, chief advisor of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, to discuss everything. Wang and Huo returned to Tongzhou by car that night to report to Yin. Yuan Tai and other county magistrates of Linyu and other counties in the war zone have requested leave and resigned to return to Baoding to report to Shang Zhen due to the establishment of the Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee. The committee will send others to take over. Furthermore, Yin and other important figures spent the entire day today discussing everything at the committee in Tongzhou. The Central Government has issued telegrams yesterday and today, urging local authorities to strictly prevent and pay attention to this matter, not to allow disputes to escalate, and to suppress this rebellious force within the possible scope. The Central Government will never recognize this act of separating the country and will take appropriate measures. Yin's personal actions should be investigated. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng has decided to go to Tangshan at the end of this month to convene county magistrates, security captains, and others to give instructions and hold meetings to discuss detailed matters such as the implementation of autonomy. The Hebei-East Pseudo-Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee sent a secretary to Beiping today to visit embassies of various countries to explain the process of autonomy. Furthermore, the committee established a Construction Committee, which will be established in Tongxian on the 28th of this month, with 27 members, inviting gentry from the 22 counties in eastern Hebei to be members. Yin Rugeng will serve as chairman and committee member concurrently. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Lei announced independence in Tangshan, issuing a notice that was roughly the same as the Anti-Communist Committee's declaration. Wooden signs in front of the departments of the Fourth Corps of the Tangshan War Zone Security Defense and all seals, stationery, envelopes, etc. were destroyed. On the 26th, they were all changed to the Fourth Corps Headquarters of the Hebei-East Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Lei, commander of the Fourth Corps of the War Zone Security, convened representatives of various stores in Tangshan on the 25th to officially announce that he had joined the Hebei-East Anti-Communist Committee and would act in concert with Yin Rugeng. Yin Rugeng sent Yin Tixin and Huo Shi to Tianjin to visit the Japanese Consul General to the Garrison Army and explain the significance of the committee he organized. (Special dispatch, 26th) The Beining Railway Bureau has not yet received reports from each station regarding Yin Rugeng's cutting off the Tangshan-Yuguan section of the railway to form a supervisory office. After inquiring by telephone, the stations said that they had not seen anyone come to take over. The railway bureau specifically reported this to the Ministry of Railways and requested instructions on the 26th based on the reports. Furthermore, there have been no changes to the post office or telegraph office. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 26th, the people from the four townships around Tangshan flocked to the city to take refuge. The slightly wealthy residents of Tangshan all moved to Beiping and Tianjin, causing each train from Tangdong to Tianjin to be extremely crowded. All shops in Tangshan closed at 7:00 PM. Trenches were dug behind Jiaotong University, sandbags were piled up, and a platoon of Zhao Xu's troops was stationed to guard each street. Ao County and Changli announced martial law, and the security team was stationed at each city gate to check people entering and leaving. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Miyun stated that a total of more than 1,000 Japanese troops had arrived at Gubeikou, and there were no unusual movements. The entire Banner area is calm. After Yin Rugeng announced his departure from the Central Government and the establishment of the Hebei-East Autonomous Committee, the diplomatic community here has aroused great attention and has telegraphed its respective governments to report. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance originally had a Hebei-Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan Regional Unified Tax Bureau in Hebei, and a sub-regional unified tax management office in Tangshan. On the 26th, according to a telegram from the director of the office, Yin Rugeng sent Gu Tixin to the office to demand the takeover of taxes and other collection rights. The Ministry of Finance telegraphed back to the director, instructing him to strictly refuse and continue working as usual. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Germany) Troppster, a German News Agency correspondent stationed in Manchuria, returned here from Tianjin today and said that he had heard Tada, the commander of the Japanese army in North China, say that the North China autonomy movement was economic in nature and could erupt quietly today or tomorrow. However, the Japanese army is prepared to deal with any contingency. No one can predict how the turmoil will end. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the establishment of the Hebei-East Autonomous Government, Yin Rugeng sent personnel to inspect trains passing through the autonomous region and levy taxes. He plans to set up an office in Tangshan to take over about 160 miles of railway from Tong to Yuguan. However, the trains managed by the railway bureau are still running normally from Beiping to Tongzhou and Yuguan. What kind of actions Yin will take in the future is very concerning. Beiping is calm, and there is no sign of the autonomy movement spreading. Doihara came to Beiping from Tianjin yesterday, and there was no activity on the surface. However, everyone feels that they will wait for the results of the meeting between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi before making plans. A certain spokesman for the Japanese army said that Doihara is currently in Beiping and has no official mission. It is speculated that Yin's official announcement of autonomy is just a posture, intended to cover up the failure of the five-province secession movement and to threaten Nanjing to negotiate with Japan quickly. Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, and Xiao Zhenying returned to Beiping from Tianjin yesterday. Yin claims to manage not only the demilitarized zone but also the counties of Changping, Xianghe, Baodi, and Ninghe. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Three or four of the county magistrates in the demilitarized zone who have established autonomous regimes are ill-disposed towards the autonomous regime and have secretly gone to the province. As a result of today's meeting of the Autonomous Committee, it was decided to dismiss them on the grounds of dereliction of duty. At the same time, in order to have a clear understanding of the autonomous regime, it was decided to carry out a thorough personnel reshuffle. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Baoding) Shang Zhen, upon hearing Yin Rugeng's declaration of autonomy, immediately telegraphed Song Zheyuan, requesting him to send troops in his capacity as Garrison Commander to suppress the autonomous government. He also ordered the county magistrates, security chiefs, and others not to listen to the rebellious orders of the autonomous government and not to act rashly.

Most of the accusations are unfounded, but there are some points that give cause for criticism.

Furthermore, the collection of over 700 yuan in mediation document fees was not approved before expenditure, which is inappropriate.

<h3>General Matsui Leaves Qingdao for Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Japanese General Matsui left Qingdao for Shanghai on the Fengtian Maru at noon on the 26th. Japanese Consul Tajiri and others went to the pier to see him off. According to Matsui's conversation with reporters, he personally has deep ties with China and is deeply saddened by the current dangerous state of Sino-Japanese relations. The relations between China and Japan were originally very good, but recently they have suddenly deteriorated. This is not only a matter for the Chinese authorities, but Japan should also bear half of the responsibility. At present, we hope that both sides will work together to achieve genuine cooperation with their original intentions. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>The Mongolian-Manchukuo Border Will Be Problematic From Now On: The Manzhouli Conference Breaks Down; Mongolian Representatives Firmly Maintain Sovereignty and Refuse to Concede; Manchukuo States That It Will Not Be Responsible for Future Incidents</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Yesterday's meeting of "Manchukuo" and Mongolian representatives in Manzhouli broke down because the Outer Mongolian representatives firmly maintained sovereignty and refused to abandon their original demands. The Manchukuo side stated that Manchukuo would not be responsible for any incidents occurring on the Mongolian-Manchukuo border in the future. (Hualian Electric, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports received from Tokyo, the conference between representatives of the "Manchukuo" government and Outer Mongolia, which had been dragging on in Manzhouli since the end of May, aiming to establish a way to resolve border issues and adjust bilateral relations, has now broken down. It is said that this was due to Outer Mongolia's unwillingness to exchange diplomatic envoys. After the breakdown of the meeting yesterday afternoon, the Manchukuo delegation issued a statement, roughly stating that Outer Mongolia had consistently maintained its attitude of non-intercourse with "Manchukuo," so it was impossible to achieve successful negotiations. The Manchukuo side repeatedly stated the necessity of exchanging envoys and establishing diplomatic relations, and that unresolved border disputes by the border committee could be handled by the envoys. However, Outer Mongolia only agreed to establish a border committee and was unwilling to make other concessions. The Changchun Foreign Ministry also announced that "Manchukuo" could independently resolve border incidents involving Outer Mongolia in the future, without consulting the Mongolian government. If any unsatisfactory incidents occur, the responsible party should be Outer Mongolia because it refused the proposal to exchange envoys, which led to the breakdown of the Manzhouli conference.

<h3>Foreign Minister Hirota Plans to Strengthen the Diplomatic Front; There is Talk of Arita Being Appointed Ambassador to China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Hirota has now telegraphed Arita Hachiro, the ambassador to Belgium, to return to the country. Arita can return to Japan at the end of this year or at the latest in January next year. Hirota plans to appoint Arita as ambassador to China, and Ambassador Arima will resign on his own initiative. There will be a major reshuffle of personnel in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Xitian originally planned to implement a major reshuffle of personnel at the end of this year, but due to the complexity of Sino-Japanese relations, the advancement of the new situation in North China, and the convening of the London Naval Conference, only a part of the officials and ministers will be changed within the year. By February or March of next spring, there will be a decisive reshuffle inside and outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Hualian Electric, 26th)</p>

<h3>Italy Threatens England and France; Considers Withdrawing From the League of Nations; Views Fuel Embargo as Hostile Act; European Attitude is Unpredictable; United States Expresses Unwillingness to Be Fooled</h3>
<p>(Rome) If various countries prohibit the transport of oil and coal to Italy, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations. According to well-informed Italian sources, Mussolini considers cutting off oil and coal supplies as a hostile act. If countries implement it, Italy will reconsider its position in the League of Nations. Although Mussolini accepted the League's implementation of financial and economic sanctions under protest, he does not view it as a hostile act. If Italy's necessary supplies are now prohibited, making the war against Abyssinia more difficult, it will inevitably lead to a serious situation, which seems likely to have dangerous repercussions in Europe. It is now believed here that the Italian ambassadors in London and Paris have issued warnings regarding this matter, and well-informed circles say that the overall situation is indeed deteriorating. Italy is deeply worried and hopes that the war in Abyssinia can be completed in a relatively short period of time, so that Italy can formally propose peace talks. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government sources believe today that the League of Nations' delay in implementing an oil embargo against Italy has made the United States' policy stronger than that of the League of Nations, so it is necessary to reconsider it. The detained oil tankers may also be released. (National Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) If the League of Nations does not immediately implement a ban on the export of military supplies to Italy, the United States will also reduce pressure on trade with countries at war with Italy and Abyssinia. It is heard that the government is unwilling to have American commerce be fooled by the unpredictability of Europe. The League of Nations' announcement of the oil embargo is not as simple as it appears on the surface. Although the government has not changed its attitude towards the trade of military supplies, it will carefully consider increasing moral and financial pressure to stop exports to Italy until the atmosphere in Geneva has cleared. (National Electric, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to information received by the government, US exports to the East African war zone have not decreased at all. The number of exports in November was no less than that in October. British Ambassador Lindsay met with Deputy Secretary of State Moore, who is handling the Neutrality Act, today, but both sides are unwilling to announce the content of the conversation. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Imperial Defence Council met suddenly today. It is heard that Britain still supports unified action by the League of Nations to implement an oil embargo against Italy. The cabinet will also meet tomorrow. (National Electric, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, as the Soviet Union's chief representative to the League of Nations, notified the League today that if League members and non-members are willing to prohibit gasoline from being transported to Italy, the Soviet Union is also willing to follow suit. The Romanian representative also announced the same attitude. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The League of Nations' Eighteen-Nation Committee was originally scheduled to meet on November 29th, but the date has been postponed because French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval could not spare the time due to his busy domestic affairs. Regarding this matter, it is believed here that although Britain has not changed its attitude towards the necessity of an oil embargo against Italy, it does not advocate that the Eighteen-Nation Committee hastily meet to decide on the oil embargo. According to the British Cabinet's opinion, an American oil embargo against Italy must be effective with the formal intervention of President Roosevelt. However, President Roosevelt cannot take action until the US Congress passes it after it convenes in January next year. The British Cabinet also believes that Roosevelt's proposal would be easier to pass if American public opinion did not see it as participating in a decision already made by other countries. For this reason, Laval requested a postponement of the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Committee based on personal reasons, which Britain was happy to accept. Political figures also believe that the US Congress may not approve Roosevelt's prohibition of the transportation of oil to Italy, but it would be possible to give Roosevelt full power to prevent the increase in US oil exports to Italy due to the Italian-Abyssinian war. In general, it is hoped that the threat of an oil embargo will be enough to make Italian Prime Minister Mussolini realize the situation and change his mind, because an actual oil embargo would inevitably shorten the time of the war against Abyssinia.

<h3>Anglo-French Experts' Talks Yield Little Result; Widely Divergent Views on the Entire Plan to Resolve the Dispute</h3>
<p>(London) It is heard that the talks between British and French experts in Paris have not yielded any concrete results regarding the future resolution of the Abyssinian issue. British Foreign Office Abyssinian expert Penderson and French Foreign Office East Africa Director Saint-Quentin only reached agreement on certain specific points. As for the entire resolution plan, in other words, a plan that would satisfy Italy, Abyssinia, and the League of Nations simultaneously based on Britain's proposal, the British and French sides still have widely divergent views.

<h3>Italy Implements a Disguised Inflation to Subsidize Military Industries; Public's Hidden Gold is Ransacked</h3>
<p>(Rome) A correspondent for this news agency reports that the Italian National Bank is currently implementing a disguised inflation policy to subsidize various military industries. The method is that the "Military Industry Subsidy Group" provides funds to various military industrial manufacturers, with the amount based on the goods ordered by the state from each manufacturer and set at 65% of the price of the goods until the end of 1936. The manufacturers will issue promissory notes, with the price of the goods that the state should pay according to the contract as collateral. The Italian National Bank can handle "rediscounting" of these promissory notes. The final result is, in effect, the implementation of a disguised inflation policy. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The movement to collect gold coins and various metal goods, launched by the public to resist sanctions from various countries, has become widespread throughout the country. Veterans of the European War have donated their medals to the government. Various automobile companies have donated gold and silver trophies and medals won in international automobile competitions to the government. Athletes with trophies have also done the same. In addition, elders of the Catholic Church have also enthusiastically contributed, such as the churches in Bisagni City, Livorno City, and other places, each donating the gold ornaments they possessed to the government. Residents of Belforte City, in memory of the soldiers who died on the front lines, have raised gold ornaments and melted them into gold bars weighing a total of two kilograms and sent them to Rome. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Venice Port) In order to resist sanctions, the government recently promulgated several regulations, one of which focuses on developing the fishing industry. The San Marco pier has therefore been reopened, and fishermen have been casting nets at night and pulling them up the next morning for several days. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The fuel used by Italian fishing boats at night will be replaced by carbonized materials instead of kerosene. Italy has more than 4,000 fishing boats, which can save a total of 50,000 metric tons of kerosene per year. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Personnel of the Italian and French Delegations to the London Naval Conference</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian delegation to the London Naval Conference will be headed by Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Grandi. In addition, Rear Admiral Piccia and Captain Masatini of the Navy will also be representatives. The government originally decided to have General Rospoli as one of the representatives, but Rospoli died a few days ago, so Captain Masatini will represent him. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The personnel of the French delegation to the London Naval Conference have been decided by the Council of State. There are three main representatives: the Ambassador to the United Kingdom Corbin, Vice Admiral Robert, Inspector General of Education of the Mediterranean Fleet, and Gatte, Honorary Governor of the Colony. There are two deputy representatives: Compon, Counselor of the Embassy in the United Kingdom, and Rear Admiral Tegou of the Naval Staff. In addition, the Chief of the Naval Staff and Naval Commander Bitrie may personally attend the conference. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>The King of Greece Enters Athens; Then Prays in the Cathedral; And Lays Flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</h3>
<p>Athens: King George II entered the city this afternoon, attended a prayer ceremony in the cathedral, and then, accompanied by the entire cabinet, laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before returning to the old palace, which is the site of the National Assembly. The King stood on the balcony and received a warm welcome from the crowd. He then held a meeting with the entire cabinet, and after a short time, the King left through the back door of the palace to rest at his private residence. During the meeting, Regent Kondylis formally submitted his resignation. King George then decided to consult with the leaders of various political parties separately before appointing someone to form a new cabinet. At the same time, the King issued an edict stating, "I am prepared to cooperate with the people to seek the spiritual and material improvement of the people of the whole country. I will forever forget everything in the past, and from now on I am determined to guarantee that the people enjoy complete equality and fairness." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Dessie Virtually Becomes a Large Military Camp; 200,000 Ethiopian Troops Concentrated; The Ark of the Covenant and the King Are Transported There; Morale Is High, Waiting for a Counterattack; It Is Now Heard That Torrential Rains Are Hindering Italian Troop Movement; The Death of Ethiopian General Seyoum Has Not Been Confirmed</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to news from Dessie, the location of the headquarters of the northern Ethiopian army, the city has become a large military camp, with tens of thousands of soldiers encamped in the suburbs. These people walked 100 miles from Addis Ababa to reach the area, preparing to go to the front line within days. The "Ark of the Covenant," which has been hidden in St. George's Church in Addis Ababa, has been transported to Dessie today. The Ethiopian army carries this ark in every small battle with the enemy. Wherever the ark goes, the Ethiopian king follows closely. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Dessie City: 200,000 Ethiopian troops are hiding near Dessie City, avoiding detection by Italian aircraft. In recent days, thousands of soldiers have paraded in the city, most of whom are equipped with new weapons. It is generally believed that these troops will set off for the front after Abyssinian Emperor Haile Selassie I comes to inspect them. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>(Rome) According to news from Magal today, Ethiopian General Seyoum, commander of the northern front, was attacked by Italian artillery on the 18th and died after being wounded. Officials here are trying to verify this. Ethiopian soldiers who surrendered to Italy have also repeatedly said that Seyoum is dead, but it has not yet been confirmed. (National Electric, 25th)</p>
<p>Italian Troops Retreat Along the Fafan River</p>
<p>Harar: The Ethiopian army's recovery of Gola and the Italian army's retreat along the Fafan River has brought comparative stability to the tense situation of the past few days. Well-informed European and Ethiopian sources here believe that the Italian army suffered this major blow because its deployment on the southern front was inadequate and it advanced too quickly. The Italian army has now lost much of the territory it gained in that area with its large army and large numbers of tanks and machine guns. Even more unfortunate is the time. If the Italian army attempts to advance again to recover the lost territory and fails to succeed temporarily, it will be even more difficult when the rainy season arrives. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Harar: According to unofficial sources, the troops of Ethiopian General Tsasstai, near Gola Hai in the Wogaden province, are now advancing rapidly without being obstructed by the Italian army. Italian General Graziani is rushing with all the troops he can muster to Isaya Bediua, about 90 miles from Luf Filandi, in an attempt to stop the Ethiopian army from advancing and prevent it from endangering Mogadishu. The main force of the Ethiopian army on the southern front is still firmly defending the line of Dega Bur, Sassa Bani. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Italian Camp Suddenly Attacked</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to official statements, the troops led by Tusi Walazz, under General Seyoum of the northern front, defeated three battalions of Italian troops at Harowade, north of Magal, yesterday. At that time, the Italian troops were camped out in the open and were cooking the cattle they had looted on the spot a few hours earlier. The Ethiopian army launched a surprise attack, killing the commander of the Italian camp and more than a dozen soldiers, and seizing rifles, ammunition, donkeys, horses, etc. The official also said that 60 Eritreans carrying military equipment and luggage defected on the 11th and 23rd and were accepted by General Seyoum in the Tambien area. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Constructing an Air Force Base in Magal</p>
<p>(Rome) A large airfield is currently being built in Magal, expanding and improving the original Ethiopian airfield there. Italian reconnaissance and bomber aircraft used to be based in Ilitri, but in the future they can be moved to Magal City. In this way, Italian aircraft can advance further. The First Army Group and indigenous troops are currently concentrated in Magal City, so there is no need to worry about defense. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Italian Northern Army Improves Its Lines</p>
<p>Asmara: A division of Italian soldiers under General Vilasanto, dispatched from Adowa, is now engaged in a frontal attack on Tambien. It is believed that Ethiopian General Siyum is still hiding in the area. Some say that the number of troops he leads is only 500, while others say it is as many as 20,000. The Italian military action began three days ago, when General Vilasanto's headquarters moved forward 16 miles. The Italian army's attack was kept secret, so it was not known until today. The effects of this battle are threefold: first, it can improve the Italian army's lines; second, it can protect General Santini's right flank in Magal; and third, it can force Siyum to withdraw from Danbian by threatening encirclement. The Italian army advanced in several routes, with two teams departing a week ago, one advancing west from Magal and one advancing southwest from Hoshan. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Ethiopian Deposed King Dies in Prison</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to official statements, former Ethiopian King Lij Yasu, who has been imprisoned in Gama Mouritai for three years, has long suffered from paralysis and died in prison today at the age of 39. King Yasu succeeded his grandfather Menelik II in 1913 at the age of just seventeen. During World War I, he was influenced by Germany and resisted the Allied Powers. He was deposed in 1916, and Menelik's daughter, Zewditu, was promoted to power and crowned Queen. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Serious Political and Financial Problems: The Laval Cabinet Faces Difficulties; The Left-Wing Parties Plot a Coalition to Overthrow the Government; Laval Resolves to Deal with the Situation with All His Might</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French Parliament is scheduled to reconvene on Thursday. At that time, the left-wing parties will jointly attack the government. Therefore, the Cabinet convened this morning for a long time to prepare response measures. It is said that it has been decided to demand an immediate discussion of financial policy. At this time of political and budgetary uncertainty, gold continues to flow out. The Bank of France lost 66 million pounds worth of gold in November. On Saturday alone, the gold outflow was worth more than 6 million pounds. At the same time, the atmosphere is extremely tense because the Fascist Party and the Communist Party are determined to resist. Today, the Minister of Finance declared that the government will never abandon the gold standard, which gave the public a slight sense of optimism. Former Prime Minister Herriot claimed that if the Radical Party members overthrow Prime Minister Laval, he will resign from the leadership of the Radical Party. Tonight, Laval will deliver a final broadcast speech, asking the people of the country to choose between two options: one is gold and peace, and the other is the collapse of the franc and instability.</p>
<p>In view of the opposition parties' resistance to the government due to the issue of Fascist leagues, Laval decided to implement the main clauses of the Shaw Report, that is, even if the leagues are not completely banned, the authorities should impose some restrictions and prohibit the carrying of weapons. It is reported that the government will ask the House of Representatives to focus on finance when it convenes on Thursday, but the opposition parties demand the dissolution of the Fascist leagues as a prerequisite. Therefore, the government's future is now very bleak. The Socialist Party has made clear its desire to overthrow the government, and said it is prepared to join a new government to replace Laval for a period of time, and guarantees to present a budget proposal within four hours after the new government is established. This proposal has now been forwarded to various left-wing factions, including the Radical Party, because Laval cannot be overthrown without the help of the Radical Party.

<h3>French Gold Outflow: Gold Reserves at Lowest Level in Three Years; Raising the Discount Rate Fails to Cure the Hemorrhage</h3>
<p>(Paris) The exchange brokers and financiers' expectations of the Bank of France raising the discount rate from 5% to 6% have been confirmed in recent days. When announcing this notice, the bank stated that France's economic situation is very dangerous. Observers believe that the bank's cash reserves are less than 7 billion francs, which is the lowest record since 1932. However, the bank authorities have carefully stated that the statutory reserve only needs to be 35%, and it is currently 73%. This point must also be noted. (Dispatch from Kokumin on the 25th)</p>
<p>(New York) The gold shipped from Europe to New York on Saturday was worth $24,600,500, all from France. Another batch of gold shipped to the United States on Friday, worth $17,200,400, also came from France. The international banking community here believes that although the French bank has raised the discount rate to 6% today, it is still doubtful whether this move can stop the outflow of French gold, because although the Bank of France raised interest rates before, it has not had any effect. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Regnier recently reported to the House of Representatives Finance Committee the reasons for the recent outflow of gold from the Bank of France, saying that most of it was due to technical reasons. One reason is that before the British general election, people generally feared that the Labor Party would win, so they transported cash to France. When the election results were announced and the Conservative Party won, they transported it back, causing the Bank of France's gold reserves to decrease sharply. The second reason is that the prices of raw materials in the United States have risen, and all industries have suddenly prospered, so American capitalists have transported back the money they had deposited in France. In addition, the United States is deeply afraid of the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia, which would cause European disputes, so it does not dare to deposit cash in Europe, which is also the reason for the sudden outflow of cash.

<h3>Chinese Antiquities: Preview Held in London; Wall Paintings Carefully Arranged and Perfected; Dazzling and Beautiful; Open to the Public for Viewing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(London) The Exhibition of Chinese Art will be open to the public on Thursday. A preview was held today. Visitors all believed that this exhibition was more perfectly arranged than previous domestic exhibitions, and that there were more attractive aspects. The four walls of the exhibition room were covered with green or milky-white brocade specially woven in China. Glass cabinets were arranged neatly, with antiquities inside. All porcelains were carefully sealed. The artistic arrangement of the exhibits and the harmonious distribution of colors made each artwork even more brilliant. This is all thanks to the efforts of Dr. Ashton of the British Museum and Chinese Commissioner Dr. Cheng Tianting. Various jades, from milky white to dark brown, were placed in one cabinet. Silk embroidery and Qianlong porcelain were also placed in one cabinet, sorted by category and not mixed together, and arranged according to the era, so that viewers can easily compare the stages of Chinese art evolution. The exhibits range from 1766 BC to 1800 AD. In addition, there are primitive antiquities whose dates cannot be verified. The tripods, swords, goblets, and mirrors of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties are particularly eye-catching, because they can prove the development of Chinese art 3,700 years ago. The ninth exhibition room is the most spectacular, with a throne inside, yellow silk curtains hanging behind it, and jade-inlaid screens beside it, carved with various birds and animals, which proves the superb research on natural objects by Chinese artists. The number of statues displayed in the exhibition is unprecedented. At the entrance of the venue, there is a Buddha statue weighing 20 tons, which is borrowed from New York. Its solemn appearance makes viewers feel respectful. The ancient painting exhibition room is also very interesting. There are many fine landscape paintings from the Song Dynasty. The ancient paintings of the Tang Dynasty borrowed from the Indian government are brightly colored, as if they had just been completed yesterday, which is even more admirable. In addition, Austria, Egypt, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Russia, Turkey, Sweden, Danzig, and various parts of the British Empire, as well as private collectors, have all sent Chinese antiquities to the exhibition. During the exhibition, famous experts will give lectures so that the public can understand the characteristics of Chinese art and increase their appreciation interest. The front hall of the venue has a map of China and a table of dynasties, and a catalog explaining everything is provided. Americans are very interested in this exhibition and deeply desire to transport the exhibits to the United States after the London exhibition closes and exhibit them again to satisfy the eyes of Americans.

<h3>During the Transition Period of Philippine Independence: The US Government Still Responsible for Defense; Philippine Military Expenses Still Listed in Next Year's Budget</h3>
<p>(Washington) Philippine Autonomous Government President Quezon once said that the Philippines' defense expenses must be reduced. However, at the same time, the US Army Department today told the Associated Press that in the budget proposal that the federal government will submit to Congress in January next year, there will be an item for maintaining the Philippine Scouts, and that item will be the largest item in the Philippines' defense expenses. Officials said that the current status of the Philippine Scouts will remain unchanged for the time being, because during the transition period of the Autonomous Government, the US government must still be responsible for the stability of the Philippine government. In addition to the Scouts, the only US troops stationed in the Philippines are the guards on Corregidor Island and the coastal artillery. It is said that the people selected for the Scouts are all local people who are familiar with the local customs and conditions, so they are more effective than regular troops. Army Department officials said that the expenses for the Scouts next year will be included in the regular military budget. As for the work of the current US military director in the Philippines, General MacArthur, it is said that his staff will not be increased for the time being, because there are already three officers assisting him, so there is no need to add more.

<h3>Brazilian Rebellion Suppressed: The Third International Incites Revolution; Martial Law Declared Nationwide for One Month</h3>
<p>Brazilian Capital: The Army Department announced today that the communist rebellion, which was quite serious yesterday, has been completely suppressed by federal troops today. According to the authorities, this revolution was originally intended to be the prelude to the same revolution in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Colombia, and Peru. The Minister of the Army, Gomez, has received a telegram from Natal stating that the rebels have been completely quelled. Although there are still battles near the city of Pernambuco, the federal troops have been able to control everything. The Brazilian House of Representatives today passed a nationwide martial law for one month because the police have searched out various documents proving that the Third International has secretly dispatched the revolutionary leader Prestes to direct the communist revolution throughout South America. Therefore, emergency precautions must be taken. Today, national public utilities have been strictly protected by the government, and many inciters have been arrested to prevent the spread of the situation. (Dispatch from Kokumin on the 26th)</p>

This order is issued. Chaozhou and Shantou Strictly Crack Down on the Export of Silver Women's Gold and Silver Jewelry is Also Searched and Confiscated Customs Seizes More Than 10,000 Yuan of Silver Dollars Bound for Taiwan Shantou Correspondence After the Guangdong Province implemented the provincial bank's currency replacement policy, the inspection of the ban on silver exports has been quite thorough. The Finance Department has also ordered the magistrates of Chaozhou and Meizhou counties to simultaneously abolish the previous regulations limiting each person to carrying no more than ten yuan of silver coins and various measures restricting the transportation of silver from place A to place B within the province. From now on, regardless of the amount of silver, it is not allowed to be carried, in order to prevent the outflow of silver. After the magistrates of various counties issued this announcement, military police, private anti-smuggling inspectors, and customs officers have strictly complied. However, many people in the inland areas are unaware of the situation. Therefore, travelers from the inland areas passing through Shantou to Hong Kong and Shanghai carry several or dozens of yuan of silver coins for travel expenses. Unexpectedly, they are searched by customs inspectors before reaching the customs or on the ship. Even if there is one yuan or several jiao in their pockets, it is difficult to escape confiscation. Women with gold and silver jewelry are all subject to search and confiscation. The strictness is evident. Shantou has a provincial branch, but its legal tender is insufficient to meet the needs of the market. One-yuan and several-jiao banknotes are particularly scarce. Exchange houses and silver shops have 700,000 yuan in silver, which urgently needs to be exchanged for legal tender for circulation. About 2 million yuan of silver is allowed to be transported back to Guangzhou by the Guangjin warship for storage. The Shantou Exchange House and silver shops have requested the municipal government to establish a custody committee in the Chaozhou and Shantou area to avoid the concentration of all silver in Guangzhou. The municipal government has agreed to submit the opinions of the silver shops to the Finance Department for approval. Whether it can be established is uncertain. In this transitional era, the people have not yet understood the true meaning of promoting legal tender, and some bury silver in the ground for divination, while others smuggle silver for profit. As for a certain foreigner with malicious intentions, he insisted on demanding silver when withdrawing money from the Bank of China. Also, on the 17th, a Guangdong ship passed through Shantou from Hong Kong, bound for Xiamen and Taiwan. Customs officers boarded the ship for inspection and found 10,833 silver dollars and 33 silver bars, worth about 2,640 yuan, in cabin number two. The customs immediately intercepted and confiscated them. Unexpectedly, Lianfa Company, opened by a Japanese person from Chao'an Street in this city, negotiated with Customs Commissioner Akeer, claiming that the silver was transported from Hong Kong to Taiwan and requested its return. The Customs Commissioner replied that according to regulations, anyone transporting silver for export, regardless of the destination, must obtain a transport permit and declare it to customs. This silver violated customs regulations and would not be returned. Lianfa Company knew that it did not comply with the procedures and still requested its preservation, awaiting negotiation. The customs then submitted this case to the Chief Customs Commissioner Meller, requesting instructions. Also, on the 14th of this month, Yang Hefeng from Dahao, Chaoyang, transported four thousand and ten silver dollars and several thousand copper coins by road from Dahao to Shantou. He was detained by the police at the Jiaoshi Wutian police station in Shantou. However, Wutian is separated from Shantou by a sea, and it is necessary to land on a small boat, which can be moored alongside the fire ship, so there is suspicion of smuggling for export. However, according to Yang Hefeng, the silver was transported from Dahao to Shantou, intending to exchange it for legal tender at Tengfa Company on Anping Road for trade circulation. Currently, there is indeed no place to exchange currency in the inland areas, so it had to be transported to Shantou. The municipal government has reported the details of this case to the Finance Department. The Finance Department has telegraphed the municipal government to interrogate Yang Hefeng and handle the matter carefully. Shandong Province Maintaining Financial Measures The City Chamber of Commerce Proposes Twelve Measures Jinan Correspondence Since Jinan received the central government's order to implement the new currency system policy, the market has remained stable. However, in this period of economic decline, commerce has been affected. Not only have banks stopped lending money, but they are also continuing to recover previously lent funds on schedule, resulting in tight credit and poor turnover. Since the provincial government issued an announcement prohibiting price increases, those who deliberately raise prices must be punished. However, merchants are also wary of natural price fluctuations in various goods during transactions. The City Chamber of Commerce believes that this situation has greatly affected the development of commerce. On the one hand, it has requested the establishment of a cash custody sub-treasury in Jinan. On the other hand, it has prepared a report on the difficult situation of commerce in this city and requested the provincial government to find ways to maintain it, requesting the banks to lend large amounts of money to activate the market finance and for the Finance Department to stipulate the methods of handling current funds to ensure that banks and borrowers are guaranteed. Yesterday, Finance Minister Kong telegraphed Chairman Han, agreeing to establish a sub-treasury in Jinan. The two matters presented by the City Chamber of Commerce are explored below: (1) It has been found that the credit in this city has been extremely tight recently, and the commercial turnover is not smooth. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching, and everyone is extremely fearful. The banks not only do not lend money, but they also urge the recovery of borrowed funds on schedule, without much accommodation. The only way to rescue and relieve the situation is to order the banks to lend large amounts of money to activate the market and for the Finance Department to stipulate lending methods so that merchants can have some accommodation and not be fearful. (2) At this time of promoting legal tender, price increases should be punished. However, if prices of goods naturally rise and fall due to local conditions, this is a constant in commercial affairs and cannot be regarded as raising prices and restricted uniformly, which would hurt the merchants' capital. It is proposed to prohibit those who deliberately manipulate or hoard goods. For natural price fluctuations of goods, permission should be granted for investigation and handling, which would greatly benefit the market. Also, the City Chamber of Commerce believes that although the central government has approved the collection of cash for the implementation of legal tender, it should still be stored in this province. However, during this transition period, the maintenance of finance in various counties and cities should be regulated for compliance. Therefore, it is specifically requested that the Finance Department draft twelve temporary measures for the Shandong Provincial Government to maintain local finance, preparing to submit them to the provincial government for approval and implementation. The proposed measures are as follows: (1) The currency circulating in various counties and cities in this province shall comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance for implementing legal tender. (2) In order to enrich the credit of legal tender and stabilize local finance in this province, all cash within the borders of this province should be strictly preserved and absolutely not be transferred or smuggled out of the province. (3) The cash in various counties and cities within the province should be carefully investigated by the counties and cities. After the investigation, the counties and cities may organize custody treasuries on their own to properly manage the cash locally. The county governments, Yantai Special Zone Commissioners, and representatives from silver shops, chambers of commerce, and various public associations, fair gentlemen, etc., shall be jointly responsible. Representatives shall be elected as guarantee committee members, and one person shall be designated as the chairman of the committee, and reported to the provincial government for record. (4) In addition to promoting legal tender as much as possible in various counties and cities, if the situation is special and legal tender cannot be supplied temporarily to meet the needs, cash and grain coupons of merchants circulating in the local area may be used temporarily in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. (5) The issuance of private banknotes by local merchants in various counties has been banned by previous orders, and the Finance Department has announced temporary measures for allowing counties to issue banknotes, strictly ordering restrictions. Now, in order to temporarily maintain the convenience of customs, facilitate the people, and relieve local areas, the previous ban is slightly modified, with a temporary limit of three months. When legal tender and subsidiary coins are sufficient to meet the needs, the ban will be lifted immediately. The procedures are as follows: A. Substantial merchants in various counties and cities who have already issued copper coin notes and Jingqian diaopiao circulating in the market are temporarily allowed to continue to use them as usual, but silver dollar notes, corner notes, and those that have not yet been issued and circulated are absolutely prohibited. B. The money notes issued by the aforementioned merchants shall not exceed 60% of their total assets (if the assets are 10,000 yuan, they shall be allowed to issue up to 6,000 yuan, and the rest can be inferred. A guarantee from three interconnected shops should be obtained in advance and submitted to the county and city governments for approval by the government for record. If the original number issued exceeds the limit, the local county and city governments should order them to shrink. If they have not been approved, they are not allowed to issue them. C. The county and city governments and the Yantai Special Zone Commissioners should conduct detailed investigations of the merchants who have already issued money notes within their borders, strictly supervise them, and report the number of issuing merchants and the total amount to the provincial government separately for approval and record. (6) Tax collection agencies in various places should collect legal tender and provincial treasury notes and corner notes as much as possible. (7) Merchants in various counties and cities who exchange cash for legal tender stored in custody should do so at the branches and offices of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications where they are located. If the counties are far away, they may come to the province for exchange. The procedures should be handled by the custody treasury in a consolidated manner. The local government should issue a passport for certification, and the banks should issue an exchange voucher for storage and verification. (8) The custody vehicles in various counties and cities should report the cash stored by merchants to the local government on a daily basis, and the local government should submit them to the provincial government on a monthly basis for record. (9) If merchants and people in various counties and cities need to use cash in the provincial capital for exchange or scattered use according to local customs, the competent inspection agency personnel should release them at any time. Those who collect and smuggle them out of the province or transport them from the provincial capital to other counties shall be strictly prohibited, and violators shall be punished according to the regulations on undermining financial functions. (10) If merchants and people within the jurisdiction of various counties and cities must use cash, they may do so according to customs. If they are transported out of the province, from county A to county B, they must apply for a permit issued by the county government, district office, or public security bureau in advance. Those without a permit shall be deemed to be smuggling. (11) After the promulgation of these measures, all previous temporary measures in this province prohibiting the exit of current silver, the regulation allowing each person to carry fifty yuan of current silver, and the Jinan City and various counties' linked exchange measures shall be abolished immediately. (12) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. Songjiang Suit and Leather Shoe Counterfeit Buyers Recently, goods have been stolen from various shops in this city from time to time. On the 26th, Tang Shuqin, an inspector of the Water Patrol Team, arrested two counterfeit buyers in suits and leather shoes, Tu Yulin from Shanxi and Huang Jizhong from Tianjin, on Songhui Road. The original stolen goods were confiscated and taken to the team. It was also learned that the Second District Sub-Station had also captured Jin Guogui, an accomplice of the gang. According to the preliminary interrogation by the team, the thieves confessed that they stayed at Songhui Inn on the night of the 25th. At 7:00 a.m. on the 26th, they borrowed five feet of white velvet from Taifeng Suit Shop and bought a large amount of silk cloth, and stole two pieces of velvet-backed crepe and one piece of Minghua crepe. When they went out, they were discovered by the shop, who sent someone to chase and capture Jin Guogui. He has now been handed over to the Second Sub-Station. Tu and the other two were walking on the motor road with large rattan baskets in their hands, looking hurried, so they were discovered and pursued. The team has prepared a document to be submitted to the county government for interrogation and verification. Suzhou Lending 10 Million to Stabilize Finance The financial market in Suzhou has seen a panic since Wang Cainan, a staff member of the Farmers Bank, absconded with a huge sum of money, and the Jiufeng, Tiansheng, and Yuankang money shops successively closed down. Yesterday, the Fengtai money shop suddenly stopped lending money, which made the situation even more embarrassing. Fortunately, the Money Industry Association organized a reserve, and the market situation stabilized slightly. The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, in view of this, believes that if the credit in Suzhou is so scarce and rumors occur, it may affect the entire financial system. It has already held a meeting and decided to jointly petition the Ministry of Finance and request the Bank of China and Bank of Communications to lend 10 million yuan to be deposited in various money shops to maintain the market. The method is planned to imitate the Shanghai industrial and commercial loan method, using substantial assets such as land deeds as collateral. Sun, the special commissioner of the Wuxian County Party Department, also recognized this and petitioned the Provincial Party Department to submit it to the central government for relief. Nantong Dasheng Auxiliary Factory Labor Dispute Settled Workers at the Jiangjiaqiao Auxiliary Factory of Dasheng Textile Factory suddenly went on strike and destroyed machinery. After mediation by representatives of the party and government organs, and after learning that Tang Yusheng and others, directors of the labor union, had incited the situation, the county government arrested them. The factory has fully resumed work. Education Broadcasting Special Issue A Brief History of the Development of Modern Science (Lectures for middle school students across the country on November 16 and 18) Wei Xueren, Dean of the College of Science, Jinling University Listeners, today's topic is a brief history of the development of modern science. Human history is generally divided into three periods: ancient, medieval, and modern. Although some people attack this method of "dividing history by era" because there is no clear boundary between eras and culture is continuous, from the perspective of the development of science, the development of science was extremely slow in ancient and medieval times, and its impact on the future development of science was also very small. Science has progressed extremely rapidly in modern times, with a wide scope and complex content. Therefore, the history of modern science can represent the entire history of science. Today, due to time constraints, I can only talk about the general development of each science. Moreover, since most of the listeners are middle school students, today's lecture will focus specifically on several sciences that are closely related to the middle school curriculum. What is the starting point of modern history? Historians have different opinions. Some say it starts from 1453 when the Turks captured Constantinople and the Eastern Roman Empire perished; some say it starts from 1492 when Columbus discovered America; some say it starts from the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 that ended the Thirty Years' War, and some advocate starting from the Renaissance. The difference is more than two hundred years. From the perspective of the history of science, the discovery of America by Columbus does not seem to have any particularly great significance in itself, but because it corrected mankind's view of the universe and led to great scientific results, it should be considered an important milestone in the course of scientific development. Let's take the discovery of America by Columbus as the starting point of modern science. Columbus, believing in the theory of a round earth, led three sailing ships and dozens of sailors, and after experiencing many hardships and two failures, finally discovered the new continent of America in 1492. Coincidentally, the famous modern explorer Byrd recently returned from his second Antarctic expedition. In October of this year, the American Geographic Magazine published an article entitled "The Second Antarctic Expedition." He made full use of ships, airplanes, wireless radio, and moving pictures this time. These two expeditions, one at the beginning of modern history and one recently, show the progress of modern science through the comparison of the two. In the era of Columbus, science was very young. Navigation and meteorology had not yet developed. Ships relied entirely on human or wind power. Apart from the compass, there were no other scientific devices. Once in the sea, the lives and property of the entire ship were subject to the control of nature, and there was no way for compatriots in the motherland to know the news of life and death. Byrd's expedition was different. The icy sea of Antarctica could be traversed by powerful ships. Airplanes could be used where ships could not reach, and wireless radio was used to report news to the world every day. Distances of tens of thousands of miles were as close as inches. Important events along the way were recorded in sound movies. In the four hundred and fifty years from the discovery of America to the present, especially in the last one hundred and fifty years, the progress of science has been truly rapid. The distance that people used to travel in a day can now be flown by ordinary airplanes in fifteen minutes. The place where news could only be delivered after a month can now be delivered by telegram within an hour, or you can talk to them personally within a few minutes. The news of Dean Wang's assassination was known to the world within half a day. The voice of one person speaking could only reach up to a thousand people at most, but now his voice can be transmitted to the whole world. The work that hundreds of people could not do in the past can now be done by one person with little effort. With scientific knowledge, modern chemists can manufacture more than 200,000 kinds of organic compounds, exceeding the number of natural organic compounds. Biologists can use eugenics principles to produce excellent varieties. Recently, they can use X-rays to help the evolution of nature. On the 11th of this month, Americans drove a balloon to an altitude of 72,000 feet, setting a world altitude record. Physicist Millikan said, "Science has transformed the world in a hundred years." Think about it, more than a hundred years ago, the lives of the people in today's so-called materially civilized advanced countries were similar to those of the people in my inland country in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. But since the development of science caused the industrial revolution, Western social and economic systems have been affected. Mr. Mi's words are very reasonable. Science has made rapid progress in the past century, and it will progress even faster in the next century. If we study the history of the development of science not only to worship the omnipotence of science and admire Western scientists, but also to learn from them and catch up with Eastern and Western cultures, and work together with all the nations of the world to develop science, it will not only be the happiness of China, but also the happiness of the world. The above has already explained the starting point of modern science and the rapid progress of science. The history of the development of science will be divided into the following four categories: (1) Science before modern times; (2) The reasons for the rapid progress of modern science; (3) A brief history of the development of various basic sciences; (4) A brief history of Chinese science and the reasons why science has not developed in China in the past. (1) Science Before Modern Times It is not easy to determine when the development of science began. Strictly speaking, the observation of the movement of the sun and moon and the invention of simple machines should be regarded as the origin of physics. According to the speculation of archaeologists, humans already knew how to use stone tools 10,000 years ago, and they already knew how to apply physics at that time. If we want to base it on historically verifiable records, European culture came from Greece, and Greek culture came from Egypt and Babylon. Although China and India are also ancient countries, they have little influence on European culture. Egypt and Babylon have fertile land and abundant products, and the people live a comfortable life, so they can study knowledge. At the same time, both countries have the difficulty of river flooding, which makes it necessary to find ways to solve it. Therefore, simple astronomy, mathematics, and geometry developed earliest in the two countries. "Necessity is the mother of invention." The relationship between mathematics and life and trade is extremely obvious, and astronomy and geometry were also produced due to practical needs. The Nile River in Egypt floods regularly every year, and the vast ocean becomes a swamp, so the Egyptians have to calculate the length of time for prevention, so there is the production of astronomy and calendar. After the river floods, the ridges and fields are submerged, and they must be measured as the standard for taxation, so there is the production of geometry. Babylon also has the same situation, because the basic unit of weights and measures has a close relationship with life. In 2500 BC, Babylon already had legal regulations for the unit of length and mass. This is a scientific historical fact that is very worthy of attention. The Greek people are lively and have an independent spirit. Their purpose of studying science is also different from that of the Egyptians and Babylonians. The Greeks do not study science for application, but study science for knowledge, so Greek science is more organized, systematic, pays attention to theory, and its scope is also wider. All sciences have sprouted, and there are many unique ideas. The geometry written by Euclid has been the basis for studying geometry for thousands of years. Alexander ordered the collection and storage of all moving, planting, flying, and diving objects from all places to Athens 230 years ago, which is really the precursor of taxonomy. At the same time, Archimedes made important inventions in the lever principle of mechanics and the buoyancy of hydraulics. His law of buoyancy is well known. Do you know that he already has a deep understanding of the lever law! He said that if you have a long rod and a place to put the fulcrum, you can lift the earth alone! At that time, philosophers had various speculations about the structure of the universe, the theory of atoms, and the evolution of heaven, but unfortunately there was not enough scientific basis. Following Greece was Rome, with a very large territory, north to the Rhine and Danube rivers, south to Egypt, east to the Euphrates River, and west to Spain. It made great contributions to spreading Greek culture and communicating Eastern and Western cultures. The Romans paid attention to practicality, which was completely opposite to the Greeks, and the same was true for science. Roman astronomy and mathematics research were far less than Greek, but they made great contributions to practical sciences such as engineering, geography, and anatomy. Vitruvius wrote a book on architecture, known as the ancestor of architecture. His book is regarded as the only masterpiece of medieval architecture. For more than 1,500 years, European architects have used him as a model. Based on his travels over the years, Ptolemy wrote geography, paying great attention to both natural and human geography. This is also due to the influence of paying attention to practicality. Galen studied anatomy and discovered sensory nerves and motor nerves. In the following 1,400 years, no one could match him. In 569 AD, King Justinian ordered the closure of schools throughout the country and prohibited people from studying Greek knowledge, opening a dark period of three hundred years. In the eighth century, Islam was introduced into Europe, and the academics of Arabia and India were also spread to various European countries. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the popes encouraged schools and established more than a dozen universities. The academic atmosphere gradually recovered. From the beginning of the 11th century to the end of the 13th century, the Crusades froze for more than eight times, making Eastern and Western cultures more harmonious. The important contributions of Arabia absorbing Indian culture to science are: (1) Mathematics. Arabic mathematics is simpler than Greek and Roman, which can greatly help the progress of mathematics. (2) Chemistry. The Arabs respected religion and had a particularly strong concept of seeking "alchemy." They also had special research on alchemy, so they made considerable contributions to chemical technology, such as distillation, sublimation, sulfuric acid, nitric acid sub-water, which the Arabs could use to seek the philosopher's stone. (3) Compass. When Arabs navigated, they used magnets to determine the direction. The method was to place the magnet on a wooden stopper and put it on the water. When it was stationary, one end pointed south and the other end pointed north. The Spaniards and Portuguese obtained it, and they were able to travel around the world and open the prelude to modern history. (To be continued)</h3>

<p>Local News Various Groups Telegraphed Requesting the Central Government to Issue a Clear Order to Suppress the Rebel Yin Rugeng Maintaining Territorial Integrity, Sovereignty, and Independence Strictly Punishing the Troublemakers to Eradicate the Source of Chaos Since the rebel Yin Rugeng, under the guise of public opinion in Tongxian County, established a puppet autonomous government and secretly rebelled, the news spread and caused national outrage. The City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Local Association, the Secondary School Association and other groups in this city telegraphed the central government yesterday, urging it to give a swift and just punishment. The texts of the telegrams are recorded below: Telegram from the City Chamber of Commerce The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, requesting it to maintain territorial integrity with all its strength, and also telegraphed Song Zheyuan, Cheng Ke, Shang Zhen, and Li Jieyanjiang to complete the key to the northern gate. The original telegram is as follows: Telegram 1: To Song, Commander of the Beiping Garrison, Mayor Cheng of Tianjin, and Chairman of the Baoding Chamber of Commerce: The national situation is weak and the situation is extremely tense. Without unity, there is no way to survive; without composure, there is no way to save the country. You are relied upon by the central government and the nation. It is hoped that you will defend the territory and complete the key to the northern gate to maintain territorial integrity, which will be admired for generations. This is a crucial moment. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce kowtows for forgiveness. Telegram 2: To the Executive Yuan and Military Affairs Commission of the National Government in Nanjing: We have just sent a telegram to Song, Commander of the Beiping Garrison, Mayor Cheng of Tianjin, and Chairman of the Baoding Chamber of Commerce, saying, "(The telegram text is the same as above)." We believe that northern Hebei was once the capital and is now a fortified frontier. If they are not beasts, they would never take pleasure in division. We implore the central government to take a just and decisive action and respond with all its strength, so that the Yu region will be preserved and conspiracies will not succeed. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce kowtows for forgiveness. Telegram from the City General Labor Union Urgent, to the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing, Acting President Kong of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission: According to reports, the rebel Yin Rugeng, under the guise of public opinion, secretly plotted rebellion and established the so-called Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee of Ji Province in Tongxian County on a certain day, openly declaring independence and issuing absurd declarations, which is extremely insane. The news has spread, and we share the same deep indignation. At this time when the whole country is unified and sincerely united, how can we tolerate his ugly seizure and division, endangering the overall situation?

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Liu Mingjia, who informed me that he read a news item in the local news section of the Shenxin newspapers yesterday about Sheng Silk and Foreign Goods Company evading national taxes. The article stated that the value of the tax-evaded goods was hundreds of thousands of yuan, and several key members of the company were detained and temporarily held by the police. He was shocked to read this. Upon investigation, the above points are completely inconsistent with the facts. Mr. Mingjia has been importing silk for many years and has always entrusted foreign companies and customs brokers to handle customs declarations. As for the goods seized by customs and police at our company yesterday, valued at around 30,000 yuan, we have tax payment receipts to prove it. Since the case has been accepted by the court, the truth will eventually come to light. However, the outside world is unaware of the truth, and we are deeply concerned that rumors will spread. Therefore, we have specially commissioned a lawyer to send letters to various newspapers to request a correction to clarify the truth. We hope that you will investigate and publish this letter in your newspaper's "Letters to the Editor" column to set the record straight. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Yu Xiangqin, November 26th.</p>

<p>Overview of Shanghai's Match Industry; Compiled by China Credit Bureau (Shanghai Business Overview, Part 3)</p>
<p>The History of Shanghai's Match Industry</p>
<p>Matches in China originated during the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, they were all European goods. In the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896), Japanese goods were imported and extensively sold, flooding North China, South China, and various ports along the Yangtze River. The financial drain each year was enormous. Later, the Juchang Match Company in Chongqing, Sichuan, was established, manufacturing matches themselves, which pioneered the domestic match industry. In the 30th year of Guangxu (1904), Ye Chengzhong, a wealthy merchant in Shanghai, established the Xiechang Match Factory to revitalize industry and reclaim rights and interests. This was the beginning of Shanghai's match industry. Subsequently, factories were established in various provinces, emerging like mushrooms after rain, and progress was rapid. Following Xiechang in Shanghai, there were the Xiang Sheng and Ying Chang factories. However, Xiang Sheng was destroyed by fire after only two years of operation. Ying Chang was established in the first year of Xuantong (1909), which is today's Dachina Match Company, Shanghai Ying Chang Factory. When the European War broke out, the supply of imported matches became scarce, and domestic matches sold well. As a result, Chinese-owned match factories became increasingly developed. In Shanghai alone, there were successively established the Dahua, Huaming, Limin, and Yuchang factories, rising like storm clouds, which was quite a prosperous time. Later, Swedish matches were imported in large quantities, and Chinese businesses lacked capital and technology. The sales of their products were greatly affected. As a result, Limin and Suchang went bankrupt in short order. The advanced Xiechang Company was also forced to close in 1924 due to environmental pressures. The match market was once again seized by foreign merchants. In 1927, the National Revolutionary Army settled in Songhu, and labor disputes arose frequently. The factories were all exhausted and barely able to support themselves. In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Nitrates resumed collecting waybill fees, requiring a fee of 100 yuan per passport in addition to the 5 yuan passport fee. As a result, the burden on match manufacturers increased, and costs rose. In addition, due to foreign competition, sales increased further. The factories were swaying in the wind and rain, and it was difficult to maintain their operations. Later, the Northern Expedition was completed, politics were on track, likin was abolished, and tariffs were autonomous. National products were somewhat protected, and labor and capital gradually cooperated. The output of various factories gradually increased, and sales recovered. However, in the midst of expensive gold and cheap silver, raw materials rose, while foreign goods monopolized and lowered prices, causing significant blows to factories with weak capital. In 1929, in order to promote cooperation among the industry, the Shanghai match factories organized the National Match Industry Federation. In 1930, the Shanghai Yingchang Factory merged with the Zhenjiang Yingchang, Zhoupu Zhonghua, and Suzhou Hongsheng factories to form the Dachina Match Company, concentrating capital and talent to operate on a large scale to compete with foreign merchants. Later, it acquired the Hankou Yingchang Company and established the Hankou Yingchang Factory. It also merged with the Jiujiang Yusheng Factory, thus firmly establishing itself as a major player in the industry. In 1933, the match tax rate suddenly increased, increasing costs. Tax evasion became rampant, and tax-evading matches were sold at reduced prices, causing significant losses to legitimate taxpayers. Foreign factories in China also dumped goods on a large scale, seizing the market. Under these heavy pressures, the match factories felt it difficult to maintain their operations. In 1934, the Huaming Factory went bankrupt. Industrial authorities, in view of this situation, held meetings to discuss controlling matches, but this has not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of Shanghai's Match Industry</p>
<p>There are currently eleven match companies in Jiangsu Province, with Shanghai accounting for five of them, including one American company and four Chinese companies. The capital amounts range from 50,000 to 3 million yuan, except for the American company, which uses US dollars. Most are small to medium-sized, and few have complete equipment. The general situation of each company is described below:</p>
<p>1. Dachina Match Company was established in July 1930 through the merger of Yingchang, Hongsheng, Zhonghua, Yusheng, and other match companies. The capital was set at 3.65 million yuan and is a joint-stock company. The general manager is Liu Hongsheng, and the assistant manager is Xu Zhiyi. There are six manufacturing plants in total. In addition to the Yingchang and Zhonghua factories in Shanghai, there is the Hongsheng Factory in Suzhou, the Yusheng Factory in Jiujiang, the Yingchang Factory in Hankou, and the Guanghua Factory in Hangzhou. The Yingchang Factory in Shanghai is located in Lujiazui, Pudong, and the Zhonghua Factory is located in Zhoupu Town, Nanhui. The business department is located in Hongsheng Building, 33 Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>2. Dahua Match Company was established in February 1930 and reorganized in 1931. The capital was set at 50,000 yuan and is a limited company. The manager is Gao Songfu, and the assistant manager is Dong Juchen. The factory is located in Liuliqiao, Pudong, covering an area of approximately twelve mu. There are approximately seventy to eighty bungalows. The distribution office is currently located in the manufacturing plant.</p>
<p>3. Meiguang Match Company was originally called Suisheng Company and was jointly operated by Ruizhong Foreign Company and a Japanese company. Later, the Japanese company withdrew, and in January 1932, it was formally reorganized and operated by an American company. It was renamed the current name and registered in the United States. The capital was set at US$125,000 and is a limited company. The general manager is S.Y. Euren. The office is located at 20 Jiujiang Road, and the factory is located on Bailinan Road, West Shanghai.</p>
<p>4. China Match Company was established in July 1932. The capital is 120,000 yuan and is a joint-stock company. The manager is Shen Qixiang, and the assistant manager is Sun Runzhai. The factory is located at Pingjiang Bridge, Zhonghua New Road, Zhabei, with approximately thirty bungalows. The distribution office is located at 18, Lane 575, Zhejiang Road.</p>
<p>5. Daming Match Company was established in December 1933. The capital is 50,000 yuan and is a joint-stock company. The manager is Shao Xiushan. The factory is located in Jigongtan, Longhua Town, covering an area of approximately twenty mu. There are approximately forty factory buildings. The office is located at A5, Fuqing Lane, Niuzhuang Road.</p>
<p>Raw Materials for Matches</p>
<p>The raw materials for manufacturing matches are mainly wood and chemicals. Wood is used to make matchsticks and box pieces, and chemicals are used to prepare match heads and striking surfaces. China's industry is underdeveloped, and there is a shortage of industrial raw materials. With the exception of a few that can be self-sufficient, the rest are imported. They are listed below:</p>
<p>1. Wood is divided into two types: for making matchsticks and for making boxes. The ones used to make matchsticks are mainly poplar, elm, linden, hibiscus, American poplar, and willow. The ones used to make boxes are mostly fir and Japanese red pine. Willow and Japanese red pine are produced in various parts of China. However, the former is soft, and the latter is hard and easily broken. Therefore, few factories use them. Currently, poplar, elm, and fir are widely used by factories in Shanghai, but they are not domestic products and are mostly imported from Japan, Russia, the United States, and Canada. Before 1915, most of the processed matchsticks were Japanese products. Later, Chinese-owned matchstick factories in Shanghai, such as Huachang, Dachina, Jiuji, and Zhonghua, were successively established, and factories switched to using domestic products. However, wood is still purchased from other countries.</p>
<p>2. There are many types of chemicals. Because the formulas vary from factory to factory, the chemicals used are not uniform. The main ones are potassium chlorate, red phosphorus, sulfur, manganese dioxide, red alum, zinc oxide, benzidine, antimony trisulfide, glass powder, paraffin oil, lampblack, rosin, gum arabic, and hide glue. Among them, manganese dioxide, antimony trisulfide, glass powder, rosin, and hide glue are mostly produced in various provinces of China. Potassium chlorate and red phosphorus come from Germany, sulfur comes from Japan and Italy, red alum comes from Sweden and North America, zinc oxide comes from Germany and Japan, paraffin oil and lampblack come from England and the United States, and gum arabic comes from India. The total value of imports each year is enormous. According to the Customs Trade Statistics Annual, the import quantity and total value in the past three years are shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Although the various chemicals mentioned above are not entirely used as match raw materials in China, those used to manufacture matches account for the majority. The total value of imports was highest in 1932, followed by 1933 and 1934. This is because more match factories were established in 1932, and the output of various factories also increased, naturally increasing the demand for raw materials. In recent years, small factories have closed one after another, and large factories have also reduced production. Therefore, the demand for raw materials has gradually decreased, and the import quantity has been affected.</p>
<p>Production Situation of Various Factories</p>
<p>In China, match manufacturing is mainly done by hand. Machines are used for what cannot be done by hand. However, most of these machines are simple in structure and have limited production capacity. The machines in larger match factories are powered by electricity, while smaller ones rely on manual labor. Few match factories in Shanghai use all machines. Most use a combination of machines and manual labor. The production situation of the aforementioned factories is described below:</p>
<p>1. Dachina Shanghai Yingchang Factory has a wide area. The internal machinery is powered by electricity. It is divided into the label pasting department, matchstick aligning department, plate arranging department, box filling department, side brushing department, packaging department, knife department, and repair department. Each department has multiple machines. There are 700 workers. The daily output is approximately forty to fifty boxes. The products are divided into safety and sulfur matches. The trademarks include Shanghai, Fisherman, Pine Old, Double Axe, Insurance, and Three Old.</p>
<p>2. Dachina Zhoupu Zhonghua Factory is also large in scale. The machines used are also powered by electricity. It employs 670 workers. It manufactures safety and sulfur matches. The daily output is approximately thirty to forty boxes. The trademarks include Zhonghua, Old Moon, Cat, Double Rabbit, Old Man, and Fishing.</p>
<p>3. Dahua Factory has basic facilities. The manufacturing machines were mostly purchased from the former Limin Match Factory. There are eight plate arranging machines. There are approximately 300 workers. The daily output is approximately thirty to forty boxes. The products are divided into safety and sulfur matches. The trademarks include Cannon, Red Horse, Dragon Horse, Train, Five Continents, Big Horse, and Airplane. Currently, production has been temporarily suspended due to excessive inventory.</p>
<p>4. Meiguang Factory is large in scale. All match manufacturing, from matchstick aligning to box filling, is done by machine. Therefore, fewer workers are employed, approximately 100. The production is quite large, averaging approximately 40 boxes per day. The matches are divided into safety and sulfur matches. The trademarks include Red Tin Bag, Meiguang, Bridge, and Little Tiger. They are exclusively distributed by Minguang Company.</p>
<p>5. China Factory is medium in scale. The machines are powered by a combination of electricity and manual labor. There are ten plate arranging machines. There are 250 workers. The daily output is approximately 30 boxes. More safety matches are produced than sulfur matches. The trademarks include Anti-Japanese, Multi-Child, Moon Goose, Red Shell, Star, Zhenjiang, Hongfu, Taigong, Zhongnan, and Dancing, totaling ten types.</p>
<p>6. Daming Factory is small in scale. Manufacturing is mostly done by hand, with less electricity. There are three motor manufacturing machines and approximately dozens of manual manufacturing machines. There are 200 workers. The daily output is approximately 15 boxes. More safety matches are produced than sulfur matches. The trademarks include Magpie, Hundred Sons, Daming, National Salvation, Suirenshi, Nanjing, and Taizhou.</p>
<p>According to the above production capacity, Dachina ranks first, Meiguang ranks second, and Daming ranks last. In the past three years, the output of small factories has been difficult to increase due to their strength. Even large factories with strong capital have not only failed to increase their annual output, but have also seen a gradual decrease. This is because match sales have not been good in recent years, and the previous overproduction has resulted in an imbalance between production and sales. This is a major reason. Therefore, factories with accumulated inventory have had to reduce production or even stop production. Observing the output of the following factories in the past three years can give an overview:</p>

<p>1935-1936 Men's Basketball Rule Changes (Continued); Announced by the All-China Sports Advancement Association</p>
<p>Article 12 of Chapter 14 is an important change: After a team gains possession of the ball, its teammates may not wait or hold the ball in their free throw area for more than three seconds. This change is also designed to prevent rotating and attracting tactics. Due to the referee's leniency, many rough actions often occur in these tactics, such as pulling and pushing by defending players and pushing or hip-checking by rotating players. It is often impossible to penalize each of these actions. If this rule is applied, they can all be avoided. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>During the game, when a team gains possession of the ball or the ball belongs to a team, its players or the player holding the ball may not wait in their free throw area for more than three seconds. (Note) "The ball belongs to a team" when a player passes the ball to a teammate. If a player has been waiting in their free throw area but dribbles forward to shoot before three seconds have elapsed, a grace period may be granted. The six-and-a-half-foot radius arc is part of the free throw area, so a player touching the line is also considered to be in the area. When shooting, the three-second time limit does not apply when the ball is in the air or bounces off the backboard, as it cannot be determined which team the ball belongs to at that time.</p>
<p>In Chapter 15A, after the note to the first article on technical fouls, add various situations of violations or fouls during jump balls. The text is as follows: During a jump ball, if one or both feet of one of the jumpers step outside the center circle, or on its diameter line, or within the opponent's semicircle before the ball is tapped, the referee or examiner may warn them. If any of the above situations are committed by a jumper before they touch the ball after the referee or examiner throws the ball, it is a jump ball violation. The penalty is a throw-in from the boundary by the opposing team. If the offense is repeated or the player deliberately leaves the center circle, they should be declared to have committed a technical foul.</p>
<p>In Chapter 15B, add a sentence to Article 8. The full text is as follows: During the game, coaches may not talk to referees or examiners, and may not enter the court except with the permission of the referee or examiner to assist an injured player.</p>
<p>In Chapter 15, the wording of the 14th penalty has been rewritten. The only two changes are: (2) If someone commits a foul against a player when they are not shooting, and the foul is improper behavior, the referee or examiner may declare an additional penalty shot. This penalty applies to exceptionally rough fouls. (5) States that if a player violates any of the rules and seriously violates sportsmanship, the referee or examiner must disqualify them from the game. Disqualification of a player under these rules still requires the execution of an additional penalty shot. The note to this penalty is to allow the player to have a chance to protect the basket even after the whistle blows when the ball is released. If this description is carefully read, the proper application of penalties should not be difficult. The full text is as follows: Penalties: The penalties for violating the following six articles are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the opposing team commits any of the above articles while a player is shooting, and the ball fails to go in as a result, two penalty shots should be awarded. If the ball still goes in and is valid, only one penalty shot should be awarded. If both sides commit fouls, each side should be awarded one penalty shot.</p>
<p>(2) Except as provided in the previous section, a penalty should be awarded for each foul. If there is improper behavior, an additional penalty shot may be awarded.</p>
<p>(3) Anyone who commits any of the above articles should have one personal foul recorded against their name. A player who commits four personal fouls will lose their eligibility to play. The penalties for disqualifying players should be strictly enforced without hesitation.</p>
<p>(4) If two or more people commit a foul against the same player at the same time, regardless of whether the player is shooting, one penalty shot should be awarded for each foul, and one personal foul should be recorded against each offending player.</p>
<p>(5) If there are serious improper actions in violation of Articles 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14, the referee or examiner should disqualify them from the game.</p>
<p>(Note) If an opposing player fouls a player, and that player (referring to the fouled player) has already started the shooting motion before the foul occurs, and the ball goes into the basket after the foul occurs, the shot should still be considered valid even if the whistle blows after the ball has left the hand, as long as the whistle does not affect the game. When the whistle blows, the player should continue or begin their shooting motion, but if the player uses a completely new motion to shoot after the whistle blows, the shot is invalid. (End)</p>

<p>Gleanings from Spring and Autumn (Implication) Leaving school a bit earlier, that is to say, dropping out without graduating, may not necessarily be a bad thing, because it allows one to understand the truth of society sooner. One day, I discovered that my family's nanny secretly hid soap in a drawer of a table that no one paid attention to; another day, while flipping through an English magazine published by the Commercial Press seventeen years ago, I found news of a certain PhD who became a ×× minister in our country, involved in fraud. The former had no knowledge, the latter received the highest education, yet both engaged in dishonorable activities. Is private gain and embezzlement truly the inferior nature of our people? Those who haven't read a single modern piece of new literature and yet condemn its flaws, and those who haven't read a single piece of ancient Chinese literature and yet insist on its inadequacy for learning—both are wrong. There's also a type that can't understand ancient literature and says it's outdated and doesn't fit the times; that's the most shameless. Saying Drunken Words Zhang Huang Drinking has a "wine gut," much like how some people have a separate wine compartment. The breadth of the wine gut varies greatly from person to person, and cannot be forced. Su Dongpo said, "I can drink no more than half a pint of wine all day, and no one in the world is worse at drinking than I am. However, I enjoy watching others drink; seeing guests lift their cups and slowly sip, my heart feels vast and unrestrained, and the taste of drinking surpasses that of the guests. I never spend a day without guests, and whenever guests arrive, I always serve wine; no one is better than me at secretly enjoying a drink every day!" His state of not being able to drink but loving wine wins my heart! As for my drinking, it's all on the surface: one cup of yellow wine and my face turns red, white wine down the throat and I sneeze; it can be said that I can't drink at all! But I always have Niuzhuang sorghum wine to serve guests, brought from the place of origin by my old sailor friend Xue A'gen, no matter how poor I am. Whenever I get a hearty drinker, I sit beside them, urging them on, unable to resist the feeling of "I urge you to drink another cup of wine, to dispel ten thousand ages of sorrow with you!" Why was I not virtuous in my past life, that I have no connection with wine in this life? Is this perhaps a way to cultivate the next life? Ha ha! In all human affairs there is class, only in drinking is there diversity. Flowers under the moon, flowing wine along a winding stream, a cup of pure intoxication, wine entering the poetic gut—this is called Confucian drinking, like the restraint of an elegant person. Two or three good friends, moonlit evenings and flowery mornings, beautiful women all around, soft singing and light sipping—this is called celestial drinking, like intoxicated enjoyment of the moon in the Jade Pool. Formal banquets, complicated etiquette, constrained all day, fearing to overstep—this is called funereal drinking, like the confinement of a prisoner. Cups not disdaining largeness, wine filled to the brim, holding counters and shouting loudly, devouring like whales—this is called donkey drinking, like a thirsty donkey on the road. Wearing caps and robes, seated according to seniority, yielding chopsticks and raising cups, conforming to the rules—this is called burial drinking, like dressing corpses for burial. Falling to the ground, cursing wildly, vomiting forming canals, lying stiff and unconscious, unaware of anything—this is ghoul drinking, like starving corpses lying down. My friend Tian Yin wrote in a poem about drinking: "Village wine is fragrant and sweet, fish and rice are plump, how many people drink merrily until the setting sun? The sky is wide and the earth is vast, what else is there to know, every household helps the drunkards home." This is yet another refined style of drinking! The above is from Cheng Shijue's "Guangjian Xiaolin" in the late Qing Dynasty. The book is full of jokes, many of them crude and vulgar, but this one is particularly witty, somewhat similar to the style of "You Meng Ying." I couldn't bear to let such a rational piece of writing be lost, so I attached it to the "Xiaolin" to be transmitted, not caring about the mixture of seriousness and humor. Old Granny Qiao A Liang Old Granny Qiao was an old servant in my family. My brothers and I were all brought up by her. My mother often said to us, because she had been in our family for many years and she worked very hard, "Don't always call her 'Mama Qiao'; you should change your address and call her 'Granny'." Afterwards, we dared not call her Mama Qiao again, and changed to the awkward and unpleasant "Granny." However, having been used to calling her "Qiao" since childhood, we often had some difficulty in changing it at first. Every time we met her, we couldn't help but blurt out the word "Qiao" unconsciously. Therefore, "Granny" changed again to "Granny Qiao." She was willing to do anything, always finishing one thing and then going on to do another, almost without any free time all day long. Sometimes, my mother saw that she was really too tired and asked her to rest for a while before continuing, but she refused to obey. My mother knew that this was her nature, so she didn't pay attention to her. However, she was just so tireless. Every summer, she always planted a large batch of okra flowers and amaranth stalks. When the okra was in full bloom and the amaranth stalks grew as tall as a person, she would pick all the okra flowers, wash them clean, and store them in small jars, adding a lot of sesame oil. Amaranth said, "This is medicine for burns. If a child is burned, applying this will always work!" Then she would pull up the amaranth stalks, cut them into small sections, and pour them into jars with salt water. After these stalks became moldy, they would become flavorful "moldy amaranth stalks." Then she would take them out bowl by bowl and give them to poor families nearby. As for the burn medicine, it was even more of a distant blessing for people! One day, Uncle Zhou next door said to her, "Mama Qiao, don't plan for others anymore. You're so old, you should buy something you like to eat. Why make yourself suffer like this?" She said, "I don't care about being old. Anyway, everything I need after I die is already prepared. What's the use of so much extra money when I don't have a son?" It has been almost a year since she died, and the neighbors nearby are still telling her stories. Some are even crying for her. In the wasteland behind our house, there are still a few clumps of the remaining okra flowers, standing there leaning! Small Talk from Plum Niche Plum Since the term "modern" became popular, the word "fashionable" has become an outdated term. People don't know that in the past, there was also a term called "romantic." The Biography of Foreign Relatives in the Book of Jin says, "Wang Meng once discussed various 'romantic' people with Sun Chuo." In fact, "romantic" is "fashionable," and "fashionable" is "modern." They are one and three, and three and one. Shanghai locals often call people "zhu luo" (pig); however, in the Ming Dynasty, there was actually a person named Zhu Lu (朱鷺). His original name was Jia Dong (家棟), style name Bai Min (白民). He was skilled at painting bamboo and proficient in ancient prose. He wrote "Famous Mountain Travel Notes." I believe that if this gentleman were alive today, people would laugh at his name because of the homophone. The Shanghai Concession's Public Works Department has an announcement that vaccinating against smallpox is free of charge. In fact, this practice began as early as the Daoguang era of the Former Qing Dynasty. I once saw a record by Zheng Guangzu from the Daoguang era that said, "Everyone must get smallpox once in their life. Those who get it through vaccination will not contract seasonal illnesses, and the smallpox will be milder. Therefore, it is customary for children to be vaccinated by smallpox specialists. When I went to Maoshan, I saw an announcement issued by the county magistrate of Jurong County, prohibiting the people from vaccinating themselves privately. All vaccinations will be carried out by an officially established bureau in the county seat, supervised by a medical instructor, using cowpox as the vaccine. Cowpox is the pox that comes from small cows. If the eyes of a small cow have pox, that is it. Those who report it will be rewarded with a thousand coins, but only the vaccine is taken, without harming the cow, to vaccinate infants, with almost no failures, and no compensation is received. If there are private vaccinators who swindle and deceive in the villages, causing harm to children, they will be arrested and punished. Those who report the information will also be rewarded with a thousand coins, and those who capture them will be rewarded with two thousand coins. This matter is rarely heard of, so I record it." From this, we can know the beginning of public vaccination. Yuhua Terrace stones are famous throughout the country, and agate stones are especially fine. My friend Yin Shui, who works in Beijing, said that all the Yuhua stones have been collected, and those currently sold are all Lingyan stones from Liuhe, Jiangbei, not real Yuhua stones. Jin Shengtan, a genius of his generation, did not die well due to the case of resisting grain and crying at the temple. Alas! Among his surviving works that can be purchased in the market are his commentaries on Water Margin, Romance of the West Chamber, Du Fu's poetry, Zuo Zhuan, Discourses of the States, Strategies of the Warring States, Records of the Grand Historian, Book of Han, Tang Dynasty prose, Song Dynasty prose, miscellaneous explanations, letters, and so on. All are insightful words gained from reading. Recently, I heard Teacher Cheng Yaosheng say, "I once saw a painting scroll personally inscribed by Shengtan. The poetry was indeed ingenious, and the calligraphy was exceptionally elegant." Shengtan was truly multi-talented! Our country's water peaches and America's apples are world-renowned products. The Japanese admired them and sought out good varieties to cultivate themselves. Now, Japan is exporting water peaches to our country and apples to America. This was told to me by horticulturist Xu Chongwen. Introducing New Works The inaugural issue of "Healthy World" has already been published, with substantial content.

Rambling Talk at Jade Mountain Thatched Cottage Xu Yun In the late Yuan Dynasty, Guan Aying's Jade Mountain Thatched Cottage was as famous as Ni Gaoshi's Qingbi Pavilion and Yunlin Hall, attracting scholars from all directions, with poetry and wine, almost every day. After I wrote "Qingbi Pavilion Examination," I also found several records about the thatched cottage in various notebooks, compiled them in my chest, and occasionally viewed them. The feeling of thinking about the past arises spontaneously. Jade Mountain Thatched Cottage is located on Jiehuo Mountain in the west of the county, built by Gu Dehui Zhongying, with the name written by Yu Ji. Inside are Zhiyuntang, Keshi Studio, Huanhua Hall, Reading House, Diaoyue Pavilion, Jiaji Pavilion, Chuncui Building, Qiuhua Pavilion, Danxiang Pavilion, Junzi Pavilion, Chuncao Pond, Biwucui Bamboo Hall, Xuechao, Xiaopenglai, Lubo Pavilion, Jiangxue Pavilion, Tingxue Zhai, Baihua Workshop, Baishi Altar, Liutang Spring, Jinliying, Hancui Place, collectively named Jade Mountain Scenic Spots. Outside is the Painting Boat, which is Zhongying's West Villa. On the third day of the third month, Yang Lianfu was entertained in it, and the maid Su Yun served coconut wine, forming linked verses. Fanghe Pavilion was also built by Zhongying. (Supplementary Records of Kunshan and Xin Counties) Purchasing ancient books, famous paintings, bronze tripods, and secret treasures, he built a villa in the west of Qianjing, called Jade Mountain Scenic Spots, where he spent his days and nights with guests, drinking wine and composing poetry. Scholars from all directions, Zhang Zhu from Hedong, Yang Weizhen from Kuaiji, Ke Jiusi from Tiantai, Li Xiaoguang from Yongjia, Zhang Yu from outside the world, Yu Yan, Cheng Qi, and Yuan Pu, all lived in his house. The splendor of the gardens and pavilions, the richness of the paintings and books, the sound of music and singing, all surpassed the times. (Biography of Gu Dehui in the History of Ming Dynasty) (Wang Hongxu's Draft History of Ming Dynasty) In the western part of the old site, stones were piled up to form a small mountain, and a thatched cottage was built on its site, with several pavilions to the left and right, planted with various flowers and trees, with paulownia and bamboo intertwined, collectively named Jade Mountain Scenic Spots. (Gu Dehui's Self-Composed Epitaph of Jin Su Taoist) The Hancui Stone of Jade Mountain Thatched Cottage was originally an old object from the Kuai Zhai Pavilion of Tu Zhongyu's family in Yangzhou. It had an inscription by Dongpo on it. In the fourth month of the Wuyin year of the Zhizheng era, Zhongying obtained it from a nunnery in the east of the city. The nunnery was the former residence of Zhou Taiwei. Outside the broken walls, the stone leaned under a tall paulownia tree. Zhongying exchanged millet for it and placed it in the central courtyard. The following year, Ke Jingzhong, a doctor of calligraphy at the Kuizhang Pavilion, saw it and admired it, bowing twice before leaving. Zhongying then built an altar with stones. When Imperial Censor Bai Yeda Jian Shan came to see it, he admired Ke's reclusiveness and wrote the two characters "Bai Shi" (拜石, Bowing to the Stone) in ancient seal script, and then "Han Cui" (寒翠, Cold Emerald) in official script, to beautify its name. Zhongying wrote a record and a poem himself. The poem said: "Good deeds have long been harmed by poverty, clear springs and white stones are also desolate. Under the Kuai Zhai Pavilion, there are friends of Su Shi, bowing to Danqiu for three hundred years." (Gu Dehui's Jade Mountain Thatched Cottage Collection) Qin Yue Zhongwen once obtained the two characters "Dan Xiang" (淡香, Light Fragrance) written by Zhao Wenmin in seal script and gave them to Zhongying. Zhongying then built this pavilion and invited his colleagues to write poems about it. (Preface to Yin Kui's Poem on Dan Xiang Pavilion) The recluse Gu Zhongying lived on the Lou River, drawing the water of the Lou River into his small villa in the west of his residence, creating a Peach Blossom Spring. The pavilion beside the water had four pillars, no more than eight feet high, with a thatched roof and a wooden floor, winged like a boat. Guests could sit or lie in it, dreaming of the waves swaying, as if there were oars propelling it. There were no other objects in it, only qin, se, brushes, and inkstones, and mostly books and paintings. (Yang Weizhen's "Record of the Painting Boat" from the Collection of Dong Weizi) In the fourth month of the Gengzi year of the Zhizheng era, Yue Yu, the Yellow Crane Mountain Man, and Zhai Wenzhong sailed from Wucheng to Haiyu, and then passed through Kunshan to visit Gu Zhongying at the thatched cottage. The peonies in front of the Chuncui Building were in full bloom. Zhongying set up wine upstairs. That evening, the thunderstorm had just cleared, and the wind and moon were clear. Zhao Shanzhang broke off a branch of honeysuckle with a golden belt and inserted it into a vase, and also wrapped it around with red and white. Zhu Bosheng supervised the drinking games. There were seven people in total. Chen Mu Yu Li and Bosheng Shanzhang were the first to get drunk. Zhongying said that although human affairs were difficult, the weather was naturally suitable, and friends gathered together. Why not say a word to record the joy? So he took the sentence "red medicine facing the steps turns" and assigned rhymes for composing poems. (Xu Chuan's "Poems of Stars and Rivers") On the twenty-ninth day of the tenth month of the Yiyou year of the Zhizheng era, the jade ball flowers in Jade Mountain bloomed. They drank wine under the flowers. At that time, the prostitute Xiu Yun from Qinchuan was there. There was a poem that said, "The beauty smiles and unties the golden bracelet, and the unique tree blooms with jade hydrangea." (Gu Ying's Jade Mountain Drafts) Ying had a passion for stones. Whenever he passed gardens or abandoned houses and saw strange peaks and rocks, he would linger and look back, unable to bear to leave. If he couldn't get them after trying every means, he would draw their likenesses and post them on the walls of his hall as furniture. (Edited by Bao Tingbo's "Jade Mountain Lost Drafts") The Little Western Paradise By Zhang Henshui Chapter 21 A Gentle, Compliant Person Passes the Court, Cherishing the Moon's Beauty. A Zealous Son-in-Law Hears a Lion's Roar from the Next Room. The woman shouted, "Don't talk nonsense. I've never been to Gansu, but I've seen it in books. It can't be all desert like Mongolia. Even if it's a desert, I'm going." The bureau chief replied in a very low voice, "That's fine." This scene in the next room came to an end at this point. After a long time, Cheng Zhiqian, covered in sweat, sat down with a smile and nodded to Beihai. Beihai smiled and said, "This is interesting, just the opposite." Zhiqian smiled and said, "This is in line with that fashionable saying: everything has an economic background. Everyone is giving in for economic reasons." As Beihai was about to say more, there were many coughs in the next room. The two of them stopped mentioning the matter. Beihai sat in silence for a while and then thought of Yueying in the front yard, so he said, "Mr. Cheng, not that I'm interfering, but I think there might be a way to help that Miss Zhu in the front yard?" As he said this, his face turned red, and he reached out to touch his head and then his face, as if he didn't know where to put his hands. Zhiqian felt that he was already very embarrassed and couldn't make him feel more awkward, so he said, "There is a way to think about it, but how can we, as outsiders, interfere with other people's marriage problems?" Zhiqian then gave such an answer, meaning to give him face, but he really couldn't come up with a concrete solution. Beihai was very happy and looked at him with a smile, "Mr. Cheng said there is a way, so there must be a way. But I don't know what kind of way it is? We just can't interfere with other people's marriage problems, but it seems like it's not a big deal to discuss it privately." (367)</p>

<p>Supplement to Shenbao This Local Publication Medical Lecture The Various Methods of Treating Gonorrhea Physician Chen Peiji In the past, methods of treating gonorrhea, besides prescribing internal medicines according to the symptoms, only involved local washing. This method was painful and yielded little benefit. Although this method is still used today, the novelty of the medicinal solution is no longer what it used to be. The most advocated method in recent times is electrical therapy, with the latest therapeutic turbid machine for treating acute gonorrhea and the short-wave diathermy machine for treating chronic gonorrhea being the most effective. The former uses light to kill bacteria, and the latter uses electricity and heat to kill bacteria. When using the short-wave diathermy machine, treatment can be done through clothing, which is especially convenient. In medicinal treatment methods, mixed gonorrhea vaccines and pigments are highly recommended. One penetrates the membrane to kill bacteria, and the other provides automatic immunity. Used together, they produce good results. Among internal medicines, those with strong bactericidal, disinfectant, pain-relieving, and anti-inflammatory properties that do not harm internal organs are considered superior, such as "Mieshalin" MESALTROPIN from the American Ling Company. This medicine not only has the effect of eliminating gonorrhea but also restores the inflamed parts of the urethral mucosa, which is why doctors are very happy to use it. The most popular medicine for local treatment is "Kola Wabaoer" because it can penetrate the mucosa without damaging it, and its bactericidal efficacy is also quite accurate. However, it is still not as good as "Gonorrhea Schulze" GONO-SEROL, produced by the German Mannl Zhi Pharmaceutical Factory, which is made with "gonorrhea serum and Schulze." This medicine is based on the meaning of automatic immunity, and its efficacy is not inferior to that of a vaccine injection. It is especially effective if the lesion is only in the urethra. Chunzai Hospital, run by my old friend Mr. Feng Shanliang, has all the above-mentioned gonorrhea treatment methods fully equipped. It employs male and female doctors who are separately responsible and has various electrical machines. The fees are very low and it has long been praised in Shanghai. (Mieshalin and Gonorrhea Schulze are both sold by Renshou Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, Shanghai. The former costs one yuan per box, and the latter costs two yuan and fifty cents per box.) A Word for Those with a Smoking Addiction Physician Yu Lei At a time when the government is strictly prohibiting smoking, those addicted to opium invariably think of quitting as soon as possible, rushing to doctors' doors for help. However, there are also many who are afraid to move forward and arbitrarily seek temporary comfort. Those with a smoking addiction hesitate to quit because they deeply fear that once they quit, not only will the addiction not be completely eliminated but they will suddenly develop other diseases, or they worry about pain, or they fear for their lives. The secular rumors about the terror of quitting smoking have been deeply imprinted in people's hearts and cannot be eradicated immediately. Before quitting, they think carefully again and again; after quitting, they are sincerely fearful. Occasionally, during the process of quitting, due to carelessness in choosing the weather or diet, they may experience very mild physical discomfort, which makes them suspect that quitting smoking is painful, causes diseases, and endangers life, so they smoke again, which is very common. Opium can indeed mask diseases, which may reappear when the addiction is gradually eliminated. Therefore, doctors who help people quit smoking are like helping people cure diseases. How can they only apply the method of quitting without conditioning the internal body? All doctors who are proficient in internal medicine can properly help quit and achieve a perfect state. Some say that quitting smoking must be based on physical condition, and some people are not able to quit. As far as I know, patients with severe pulmonary tuberculosis who are already on the verge of death should not be helped to quit. In addition, anyone who is ill, especially the elderly, should not quit immediately, referring to the fact that their physical strength has not recovered, because during the period of addiction elimination, the quitter must be able to improve their physical strength before they can quit. In short, quitting smoking is better than curing a disease. It is necessary to choose a doctor carefully. The determination to quit must be present, otherwise, even with a good doctor, it will be in vain. (The author of this article, Mr. Yu Lei, is an old friend of mine. He is proficient in medicine and good at helping people quit smoking. Countless people have escaped the clutches of the black book through his skillful hands. Thank-you letters are abundant and his reputation is widely praised. His principles of quitting smoking, his grand and insightful theories, have been repeatedly seen in newspapers and do not need to be introduced. He is currently practicing at Chunzai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Editor). Talking about Leukorrhea Internal Medicine Mieshalin Physician Jiang Guofan In recent times, the treatment of leukorrhea, whether acute or chronic, or with complications, is generally divided into two types: internal medicine and external treatment. For external medicine, modern doctors all use "Gonorrhea Schulze" GONO-SEROL, which is fast and effective and universally recognized, so there is no need to repeat it. Internal medicine often uses urinary disinfectants and an aromatic oil called Bair Sanmo. Although the names of this type of internal medicine sold on the market are different, their content is mostly of this type. Because the nature is simple, its efficacy is naturally difficult to be complete. However, "Mieshalin" tablets MESALTROPIN are a precious raw material from the American Ling Company for treating urethral diseases and are an excellent product of the American Ling Company. It functions to promote urination, disinfect, astringent, reduce swelling, soothe the nerves, and relieve pain. In addition to a powerful urinary tract disinfectant, the ingredients acetic acid-based salicylic acid and benzoic acid can make the alkaline urine of gonorrhea patients acidic, so that gonococci are easily killed. Other ingredients such as monobromide camphor are good medicines for calming nerves, especially sexual nerves, which can calm the muscles of the urethra. All acute pain and irritation in the urethra, unpleasant penile erectile pain, and seminal emission can be eliminated. Mieshalin contains this kind of medicinal essence, good quality, and efficacy in one furnace. It is no surprise that it can achieve unprecedented good results in treating gonorrhea. Modern doctors call this product the most effective internal leukorrhea pill and the most perfect of all urethral disinfectants, which is certainly not an empty word. Now I will introduce its therapeutic scope below, so that those in the country who suffer from this disease can have a choice. "Mieshalin" can not only control gonorrhea but also eliminate urethral pain, regardless of men or women. It is effective for various kidney inflammations and cystitis. Casual Talk on Stomach Ailments (Physician Sun Zhiyao) Our bodies are able to obtain adequate nourishment and maintain healthy lives entirely thanks to the food we eat three times a day. The intake and digestion of food rely on the stomach. The stomach is a machine that specializes in digesting food and producing nutrients. If the stomach has any problems, digestion will inevitably be affected, the body will gradually weaken, and diseases will easily spread. If we want a strong body, the first condition is to have a healthy stomach. The most common symptom of stomach disease is stomach pain, which is commonly known as liver and stomach pain. The cause of stomach pain, in addition to nervous stomach pain caused by mental agitation, is generally due to excessive stomach acid. "Weibao" WEABO, sold by Renshou Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has a special effect on stomach pain. It can neutralize stomach acid so that the oxygen content in the stomach remains at an appropriate level without the disadvantage of excessive dosage. At the same time, it can also coat the stomach wall to protect the gastric mucosa and does not hinder the secretion of gastric juice. It also has a rapid pain-relieving and calming effect on nervous stomach pain. The medicinal properties are very mild and do not contain opium, morphine, or other anesthetics. Even with regular use, there are no drawbacks. The Efficacy of "Miejuejun" Physician Yuan Yimin There are countless medicines for treating skin diseases, but very few are perfect and effective. To know the appropriate medicine for skin diseases, it must have the following conditions to be called an excellent product: (1) It has a strong bactericidal power without harming the skin at all. (2) It eliminates pain and itching at the affected area. (3) It does not harm internal organs due to skin absorption. (4) It must have no offensive odor and will not stain clothing. Only then can it be called beautiful and good. "Miejuejun" is an excellent preparation for skin diseases. Whether it is scabies, stubborn tinea, eczema, pruritus, etc., it has immediate miraculous effects. Its strong bactericidal power can penetrate deep into the skin layer and exert its great miraculous effect, without harming the skin surface and internal organs at all. As for pain and itching, one application will eliminate the suffering. Moreover, it has a fragrant odor and will never stain clothing. This medicine is one of the good medicines sold by Renshou Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Treatment of Sexual Neurasthenia Physician Feng Shanliang So-called sexual neurasthenia means that the sexual nerves are easily excited and easily fatigued. In the initial stage, patients themselves feel things like seminal emission and premature ejaculation, which is commonly known as loose seminal emission. In fact, it may come from the relaxation of the prostate gland or the hypersensitivity of the spinal cord's ejaculation center. This symptom is indeed a part of neurasthenia and can be treated with general methods for neurasthenia. However, sexual neurasthenia does not necessarily include cerebral neurasthenia. The disease is only local, so local treatment is also important. Revenfechter said, "Electrical therapy is an indispensable treatment for nervous impotence. Although this disease is a part of neurasthenia, if there are any obstacles in the genital area, general therapy is not easy to completely cure. It is necessary to apply local electrical therapy. This is very clear." When diagnosing this disease, it is necessary to seek details and examine carefully. Asking questions is necessary. It should be clearly known whether the obstacle is in the lumbar spine or the prostate gland, and then the treatment should be adapted to achieve good results. There are many drugs used for sexual neurasthenia. Organ therapy seems to be most suitable for this purpose. Laichiting and Strychnos nux-vomica have been praised for their function of strengthening the nervous system. Aphrodisiacs are also appreciated. In the general treatment of neurasthenia, "Anershen" AROLSEN has considerable value. This medicine has been used repeatedly and has an amazing and rapid effect on seminal emission. (Editor's note: "Anershen" is one of the good medicines sold by Renshou Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Each box only sells for one yuan and fifty cents and can be taken for ten days.)

Talking about the Absurdity of Banning Broadcast Programs Jia Wei According to yesterday's newspaper, "Xin Sheng News Agency said: The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is now planning to ban absurd radio programs. Yesterday, Section Chief Zhang Binghui of the Fourth Section of the Bureau informed us of the following details: Since the advent of radio broadcasting in this city, various stores have used it for exaggerated publicity. Moreover, in order to cater to low-level tastes, radio stations often broadcast absurd programs, such as decadent 'crying...' and vulgar and obscene ditties that are unbearable to listen to. All of these have a negative impact on the future of the nation, fostering a decadent atmosphere, which is very hateful. The Bureau, aware of this, believes that banning is necessary to revive the declining morals and curb potential disasters. Therefore, after careful consideration, it has taken swift action..." Originally! "Anything that comes to China changes" is a generally accepted truth. Without going into the problems of politics, philosophy, literature, etc., just take this radio broadcasting station as an example. All countries in the world use it as a new tool for education - implementing educational broadcasts, but in our country, it has become a "pastime" for the idle class day and night. Of course, since there is "leisure" to "pass," then "seeking pleasure" and "finding entertainment" are needed. It is inevitable that the radio station's broadcast programs will flow into "entertainment." Moreover, today, everyone knows that radio broadcasting stations are used as publicity tools for general companies and stores. It is also a fact that radio stations make profits from this and become commercialized. In this way, in order to attract customers and make exaggerated publicity, and to cater to the general "low-level tastes" of the audience, it is also an inevitable fact! As for the taste to become "low-level," it is also the "true color" of our society. It is very common for storytelling, civilized dramas, and bangbang operas to be very popular; while movies and dramas with social theories and are more serious are ignored. Moreover, on the broadcast platform, we can often hear reports that a certain company hired a certain "comedian" to broadcast programs, saying: "A phone call came from ×× Road × Mansion requesting to sing 'Cry ××'" "Capture..." etc., which is a true explanation of the "taste" of the general audience. However, these are not without social basis. The times are constantly progressing, and society is changing. The old society is being washed by material civilization - changing, changing, new, new, absorbing foreign "civilization." However, inside, in the ideological form of our society, there are deeply hidden and encompassing thousands of years of "feudal remnants." At the same time, the generally low level of social culture, coupled with the one-sided enjoyment of the declining idle class, and the seeking of nerve stimulation and anesthesia by the suffering petty bourgeoisie</p>
<h3>The Future of the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Ang Ruo</p>
<p>The Philippine Commonwealth was formally established on November 15th. This marks the beginning of a new era in the relationship between the United States and the Far East. After ten years, the Philippines will become a completely free and independent nation. However, considering the general global situation and the changing landscape in the Far East, can the Philippines maintain its independence? According to the current Independence Act, it will be very difficult for the Philippine economy to survive on its own after separating from the United States. If the Philippine economic structure collapses and chaos ensues, what can stop Japan from intervening under some pretext and repeating the past aggression in Manchuria? Japanese imperialism cannot be taken lightly. This sense of fear will cause Philippine leaders to appeal to the United States to maintain some kind of economic, or even political, relationship with the Philippines.</p>
<p>The United States has always promoted foreign trade as a step towards improving the Philippine economy. The Philippines and the United States have had completely free trade since 1909. Initially, there were some quotas, but these quotas were completely eliminated by 1913. Since then, trade between the two countries has been completely free from any tariff barriers. The Philippines' foreign trade has since seen a sharp increase, with the total value of imports and exports increasing by a massive 370 percent between 1909 and 1929.</p>
<p>Two points are crucial about this trade development. First, the Philippines has become unable to break away from the American market. In 1900, the United States absorbed only 12 percent of Philippine exports. By 1934, the United States accounted for 65 percent of Philippine imports and 87 percent of Philippine exports. The second key point is that Philippine exports are concentrated in only a few agricultural products. Sugar accounts for more than 60 percent of the total Philippine exports and is entirely sold in the American market. Last year, sugar, coconuts, hemp, and tobacco accounted for more than 90 percent of the total Philippine exports. This trade development is not one-sided.</p>
<p>The Philippines is a major customer for all American exports, ranking eighth in 1933. It ranks first in cotton cloth, butter, and cigarettes. It is also the best consumer of meat and steel manufactured goods in the Far East. Filipinos have already become fond of American goods, so the potential market may be even more valuable.</p>
<p>Although this trade is mutually beneficial, the Philippine economy is fundamentally unsound. Philippine prosperity relies too much on foreign trade and too much on the American market. In political terms, the Philippines has been steadily progressing towards autonomy, but in economic terms, it has been just as steadily moving towards establishing an inseparable close relationship with the United States.</p>
<p>If Philippine independence is intended to prepare them to shoulder the heavy responsibility of independence, that is another matter. In reality, the motives of the US Congress are not so lofty. The US Congress passed the Independence Act simply due to the pressure from certain farmers' groups, believing that this would establish tariff barriers to exclude Philippine imports. If it were not to resist Philippine sugar and coconut oil, the issue of Philippine independence would probably still be empty talk.</p>
<p>Before the economic panic, no American opposed Philippine imports. But in 1930, the prices of sugar and domestic meat oil and other products fell sharply, and farmers' groups began to mobilize. They believed that the tax-free import of Philippine sugar and coconut oil was the main reason for the fall in the prices of American agricultural products. Initially, they campaigned for taxes on Philippine imports. Later, they realized that it would be impossible to levy import taxes if the Philippines remained under the American flag. Therefore, they decided to support the independence movement.</p>
<p>There is much evidence for this. The remarks of Senator Heflin are representative, he said, "They (Filipinos) are like a big millstone hanging around the necks of cotton, peanut, bean, and grain producers. Let us give them independence... Let us restore the freedom of the Filipinos... After that, if such cheap and poor-quality goods are imported again to harm our American farmers, we can tax them." It is hard to believe that the import of Philippine sugar and coconut oil would have an adverse effect on the prices of American sugar and meat oil. Taking sugar as an example, the United States has never been self-sufficient. In 1933, the sugar produced in the United States was only enough to supply 26.5 percent of its needs. It imported 15.5 percent from Hawaii, 12.5 percent from Puerto Rico, and 20 percent from the Philippines. The remaining 25.5 percent was supplied by Cuba. It goes without saying that tax-free Philippine sugar is not enough to affect the price of American sugar production.</p>
<p>However, the sharp increase in Philippine sugar exports in the past decade has indeed had an adverse impact on the sales of Cuban sugar. Therefore, New York financial groups related to Cuban sugar also joined in supporting Philippine independence. However, these financial groups and agricultural groups do not openly cooperate, because although they share the same interest in resisting Philippine competition, the latter also wants to abolish the preferential tax rates for Cuban sugar. As for the coconut oil issue, the situation is similar in many respects.</p>
<p>The American farmers' groups' movement to exclude the Philippines is either ignorant of the facts or being fooled by some people in the Washington parliament. They can take this opportunity to run around busy with the Philippine independence issue, deliberately showing the importance of their position, rather than being compared to those who are idle.</p>
<p>The Philippine Independence Act itself can well demonstrate this shady scene. On the one hand, during the ten-year self-governance period before complete independence, the Philippine market must be open to free trade in American goods. On the other hand, the export of Philippine sugar, coconut oil, and ropes to the United States will be subject to quota restrictions. In the last five years of the self-governance period, the Philippine government will also have to levy special export taxes. The US Congress was still not satisfied with this one-sided approach. Before the Independence Act was signed, it passed a domestic tax on coconut oil and stipulated quota restrictions on imported sugar.</p>
<p>After the Philippines completely loses the American market, the coconut oil industry and the cigar industry will inevitably collapse completely. However, the world still needs Philippine copra and tobacco, so the basic coconut industry and tobacco industry may not be severely hit.</p>
<p>Sugar is the most serious problem. Due to Americanization, Philippine sugar costs are very high. If the American market is not open and free trade is not allowed, it is difficult to be optimistic about the Philippine sugar industry. More than two million Filipinos rely on the sugar industry for their livelihoods. Furthermore, sugar taxes account for 6 percent of government revenue. The collapse of the sugar industry is enough to affect the entire experiment of independence. If government services such as hygiene and education are suspended due to lack of funding, the political situation will not be stable.</p>
<p>Sugar exports are also closely related to the security of Philippine banks and other institutions. According to a report from the Philippine Inspector General 18 months ago, the sugar industry accounts for 47 percent of the loans of the ten banks in the Philippines. The National Bank's loans of US$22.5 million are 77 percent in the sugar industry. Sugar freight accounts for 4 percent of the revenue of the state-owned Manila Railway.</p>
<p>If the Philippines can break away from the United States without interference from other external forces, it can still survive even if it is weak. However, the situation in the Far East cannot guarantee this. Since Filipinos must solve the problem of self-defense and self-survival, even the most optimistic do not dream that training the navy and army can resist foreign aggression. The only hope is to join the League of Nations and have its permanent neutral status guaranteed by international forces, or to conclude an alliance with a strong country.</p>
<p>Joining the League of Nations is valuable, but it does not provide much security for weak countries in the Far East. Western powers are also unwilling to conclude a defensive alliance with the Philippine government. Such an alliance is of little value to the great powers and would only provoke Japan's resentment. The only solution is neutralization, that is, uniting countries related to the Far East to jointly guarantee the independence of the Philippines. This is also the meaning of the initiators of the Independence Act. They believe that the Philippines is located in a central and strategic location, and that the countries concerned are willing to guarantee its neutrality, rather than placing their own territories in danger. But Japan is always an obstacle. Even if neutralization is successful, is it enough to guarantee it? The neutrality of Switzerland is enviable, but the neutrality of Belgium cannot be forgotten either.</p>
<p>The real political problem is Japan. The Philippines' position is very important, and there are many other characteristics that attract Japan. If Japan occupies the Philippine Islands, it will control the entire chain of islands on the East Asian coastline and can further invade British and Dutch territories.</p>
<p>Colonization is also a problem. There are currently 20,000 Japanese living in the Philippines, most of whom have lived in Davao Province for a long time. The Philippines is suitable for immigration. The average population density in the Philippines is 120 people per square mile. The Philippines' products are also needed by Japan. Its iron reserves rank first in the Far East. There are gold, lead, manganese, and chromium everywhere. There are more than 460,000,000,000 board feet of high-quality timber.</p>
<p>There is no question of Japanese economic aggression against the Philippines. They can develop the rich resources by investing, and they can monopolize the Philippine import market. The Japanese have developed the sugar industry in Taiwan beyond their own needs, so the economic relationship between Japan and the Philippines cannot solve the sugar industry problem in the Philippines.</p>
<p>What about the US-Philippine relationship? The policy of complete withdrawal after ten years may be implemented. Many powerful people in Washington believe that the Philippines is a burden on the United States' world position, and that the United States' withdrawal may avoid the danger of war with Japan. As for abandoning the Philippines to Japan's mercy and allowing thirty years of American management and Christian culture to go down the drain, these people are indifferent.</p>
<p>The second path is for the United States to amend the Independence Act, abolish the export tax regulations, and grant the Philippine government broad autonomy in fiscal and tariff matters. The US government should also conclude preferential trade agreements with the Philippines for sugar, coconut oil, and other goods. This would avoid the criticism of sacrificing the Philippines to benefit American economic groups.</p>
<p>The third solution is to place the Philippines in some kind of dominion status, so that a permanent political relationship can occur between the US and the Philippines. This would better guarantee the future of the Philippine Republic. Britain and the Netherlands would also be more satisfied with this.</p>
<p>In short, if the United States has any sense of responsibility for the Filipinos and their future, then the current trade obstacles should be abolished and replaced by other measures to enable the Filipinos to maintain their independence. If the United States no longer has any sense of responsibility, if it does not hesitate to sacrifice national policy for the selfish attempts of a few people, then the people of the country should also understand the truth.
