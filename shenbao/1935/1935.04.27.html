<p>— （歐洲通訊）</p>
<p>英國暫時放棄反俄政策　德法衝突或可因此緩和</p>
<p>英掌璽大臣艾登、於參加柏林的英德談判以後、接着就按照預定日行程訪問莫斯科去了、這變海中大鯨跑到東歐去同陸上巨熊見面、而又正當國際風雲特別緊急的時候、它的意義並不只關係於歐洲未來的和平或戰爭、就是全世界的能否維持現狀、也要看這一次談判雙方到底有沒有妥協的可能而定、</p>
<p>英俄的對立、使幾年來的國際政治更加複雜、例如、日本强奪我國東四省、沒有英國的默契、那末事情就不會這麼簡單、德國的重整軍備、沒有英國的暗中袒護、希特勒也斷然不敢出此强硬的手腕、自然英國並不是有愛於日德、他一貫的政策、無非只計劃造成一個反俄戰綫、所以當日軍佔領瀋陽以後、日人曾以進攻蘇俄的口號、根本軟化了英國輿論、東洛迦諾條約也因爲英國不願意放棄反俄政策、結果逼得法國外交家走頭無路、讓德國從容暗中擴充軍備、在英俄談判未舉行以前、法國各報時在担心、英俄的不相容、使法國外交倍加困難、法國爲對付德國計、需要强有力的軍事同盟國、於未來戰爭中、法國旣不可缺乏蘇俄的陸空軍、而又需要英國海軍的帮助、可是這二者不能兼有、聯英或聯俄、法國必須選擇一國、因之、賴伐爾才覺得左右做人難、年來德法問題的不容易解决、英俄的衝突也算是個主要原因、</p>
<p>西門的訪問柏林、事前德國頗存過大的奢望、希特勒曾利用過他日耳曼軍人豪爽的性格、並特其的演說天才、原想以赤化危險來說服西門、替德國於英俄兩國的矛盾中尋求一條出路、但是以冷酷著名的英國人、你要他動點情感而忘記大英帝國的利益、簡直就是妄想、這尤其是精通法律的西門外相、人家本來就說他是個「冷中又冷」的英國人、此次希特勒應用了德國式的外交、凑巧碰到他、自然不容易佔到什麼便宜、</p>
<p>其實、英國最近的外交路綫、雖說目標在於反俄、但自從上過日人一次大當以後、也就明白過來、强中自有强中手、別人也不見得一定比英國人笨、較從前似乎要小心得多了、德國因為地理上與蘇俄遠隔、歷史上與法國相仇、國社黨主義固然與蘇俄衝突、可是在軍事上德國能否作爲反俄的先鋒、仍是個疑問、英國這一點是看得很淸楚的、此次英德談判、西門所要明瞭的並不是以德國有反俄的决心、就令認爲滿足、而是要看、第一、反俄戰爭是否能够實現、其次、德國有沒有別的野心、然後才决定英國對德最後的態度、希特勒在這兩點上所給予西門的答復、似乎仍只是一種模糊的態度、他把反俄問題、作爲此次談判的主要對像、原則上是對的、但他並沒有進一步的主張、這很容易使英國感到德國只以反對蘇俄當作口號來要挾、實際上是另有目的、例如、希特勒解釋德國的重整軍備、原因全在於防俄、他把蘇俄準備赤化歐洲的計劃、加以動人的描畫、而將保護文化的責任落到自己身上去、這是希特勒了解英人的地方、在西門眼中、民族社會主義的德國同共產主義的蘇俄、根本豈不是半斤八兩、大家同是搗亂的傢伙、最重要的、只要不妨害英國的利益就行、希特勒認爲蘇俄除擁有百萬陸軍以外、尙有世界上最强的空軍、而且蘇俄空軍於發生戰事時、德國東部各大城市都有被轟炸的危險、所以英國應同情德國的擴充、軍備、再如德國的拒簽東洛迦諾條約、也出於同樣的理由、希特勒以爲、德國與蘇俄早有勢不兩立的氣概、倘若德國加入某種東歐的保安公約、那末一旦某個反蘇俄的國家向蘇俄進攻時、德國要出兵帮助蘇俄、這簡直就不可能、同樣的、德國受到別人的攻擊時、也忍受不下紅軍的開入德境、總之、爲了保障歐洲的安全起見、德國在陸空軍方面有與蘇俄平等的必要、至於海軍、德國則要求最少也要與法國平等、其目的、據說仍在防俄、</p>
<p>這一下、希特勒可把英國人看錯了、英國固然希望德國肯做反俄的先鋒、假如眞眞能够寳現時、英國就多讓步一點、也未嘗不可以、但希特勒拍拍胸膛的態度、大有日本人的神氣、事情還沒有做出、自己先要了一大堆好處、這是英國人所不願意再上當的、另一面、日耳曼這怪物、所恐懼的幷不北法國、就英國也時存戒心、西門抵柏林時、正當德國公佈增軍以後、舉國大有戰時的狀態、此外、希特勒本人更親自吿訴西門、德國的空軍實力已趕上英國、希特勒的本意也許只在向英國討好、表示自己的力量已足當反俄的先鋒、但在西門聽來、意義就大不同、英國生怕蘇俄消滅不掉、平空反而又跑出一個德國來、對於大英帝國幷沒有好處的、柏林談話的結果、因雙方的討價還價、各人的目的不同、英德問在反俄這一點上、已無法一致、至此英國政治家又玩他的老把戲、退一步靜待變化了、</p>
<p>恰在這個時候、艾要跑到莫斯科去、此次英俄談判、對於蘇俄意義的重大是不用說的、連斯太林—蘇俄此日無冠之王—他除了同駐俄的美大使往還以外、從來是不接見別國的外交官的、但這一回是個例外、他延見艾登了、他發問是否英國讓德國在東歐自由行動、這是一個很有趣味的對照、在莫斯科談話的對像却是德國、有人說、英國外交家、此次訪問德俄的結果、唯一的成績、就是使德俄兩方公開地互相咒罵、至於歐洲整個局面、還是同從前一樣、此外所改變的、也許只英國暫時有放棄進攻蘇俄的企圖而已、</p>
<p>假如反俄戰爭一時無法實現的話、那末在英俄間大家就有一個共同點、希望和平、希望設法維持現狀、這尤其在西門訪問柏林以後、英國一面旣明白德國的眞面目、同時歐洲形勢也不容許英國再有這種冒險的計劃、因之、英俄關係就急轉直下、</p>
<p>此次莫斯科談話、最主要的一點、是在如何去維持歐洲的和平、蘇俄的主張、仍是締結東波迦諾條約、由於這個條約的規定、蘇俄東部邊境得到法國幷捷克的實力保障、自然不再恐懼德波的異動、而英國呢、則希望在國聯領導之下、歐洲和和平、經過大家讓步的結果、在原則上容納了雙方的主張、這是說、英國贊成東洛迦諾條約的簽定、而蘇俄更須以全力帮助在英國主持下的集團公約、什麼是集團公約呢、換一句話、這正是英國歷來歐陸政策之一種變相、維持各國間的均勢、倘若這個集團公約果然實現時、那末歐陸四雄、法·俄·德·意·間便產生了一種均勢、屆時英國的舉動便可以左右全局、我們可別誤會倫敦政治家、以爲他們於英德談判失敗以後、會加入反德集團、强迫希特勒屈服、相反的、德國的再興、對於英國的外交、只有更加便利、所以今後的英國、無論是否同法俄妥協、其歷來袒德的態度、大約仍不至於根本變更、</p>
<p>此次英國暫時放棄反俄政策、表面上好像純粹爲了和平、倫敦紳士不單在歐洲替德俄居中作個調停人、甚至於還願意顧及遠東日俄間的糾紛、對於英國這種「友誼」的舉動、蘇俄却非付一宗物質上的代價不可、這交換的條件、最重要的、蘇俄要停北在英國本部幷屬地內的共產宣傳、因爲只有如此、英國政治家才會相信李維諾夫的社會主義國家、與資本主義國家併存論、雖然、這個條件還是不够的、</p>
<p>一九三四年英國對俄的貿易、比一九三三年幾乎增加了四倍、而本年一月間對俄的輸出總數爲七〇六四〇八金鎊、在去年一月間、只五四八四八二金鎊、此外、蘇俄已向英國宣吿、將從前俄國每年所運至美國的現金、以後地點改在倫敦、這樣一來、蘇俄在英國的定貨額將要大增、根據蘇俄在英國的外交人員之意見、要按照預定的計劃實行、在三個月以內、英國的失業人數就可以減少二十五萬人、目前各國正苦於失業問題的時候、減少二十五萬人、這數目對於英國才是一個巨大的誘惑、英俄此次所以趨向於妥協也許經濟還是個最重要的原因、蘇俄善於運用對外貿易的武器、於是乎就英國紳士也感到非更改原來的態度不行了、這回莫斯科與柏林的互拉英國、因為大家的立場不同、所以態度各異、德國一面固然限於日耳曼民族的軍人性格、無法裝做「貌似和平」而另一面德國也需要表示一些實力、然後才獲得英國的信任、使反俄戰綫有成立的可能、因之、德國才能够達到所要求的目的、所以當西門抵柏林時、希特勒曾派本人的衛隊全副武裝到飛機塲上去迎接、蘇俄便不然、此次艾登在莫斯科所看到的、幾乎全是關於文化建設的部分、例如圖書館博物院、劇院中的舞蹈、幷莫斯科新近完成的地道車等等、甚至於據說紅軍俱樂部也臨時加上新的裝飾、總之、處處無非表示出一種和平、連從來幾乎每日不斷地莫斯科西郊天空上練習的飛行隊、於英國客人在莫斯科的期問內、再也見不到一架飛機的踪跡、蘇俄是想吿訴英國、它只注重已本國內部的建設、無意於侵略別人、本來、國際政洽、各人都以本身的利害爲前提、自然無所謂愛憎、德俄的招待西門、艾登、只形式問題、當然不至於影響及英國根本的態度、但我們要記着、英國還是一個竭力想避免戰爭的國家、所以蘇俄這種態度、對於英國却也會發生一些作用的、</p>
<p>我們只要對照英德與英俄的共同宣吿、就會明白英國的態度、已經動搖的了、未來的歐洲整個局勢如何變化固然難以預測、但英俄的對立倘若眞的消除掉、那末德法也許可以避免一戰、不過、在此際而言、懸崖勒爲、究竟不是容易的事情呀、（四月三日於柏林）</p>

<p>欣欣向榮之西京市</p>
<p>陝西爲古雍州地、省垣卽舊西安府城、周秦漢西魏北周隋唐等七朝、均建都於此、或其附近、西安府治、舊轄咸寗長安二縣、民國取消州府、合併咸長、統稱長安縣、周初都鎬京、在今西安西南二十餘里、迨遷洛陽、鎬京卽廢、秦剪滅六國、定都咸陽、咸陽宮廢、阿房繼起、項羽入關焚阿房、而漢之未央宮成、未央宮廢、隋建新都於今長安、唐初擴大之、城東西約十八里、南北十五里、周六十七里、後復縮小、明洪武初、重修唐舊城、淸時因之、僅有修補、民國沿其舊觀、仍命名曰西安、二十一年中央定洛陽爲行都、西安爲陪都、首都旣曰南京、行都爲東京、故西安淵源周名、又稱西京、或謂西京亦漢唐之舊稱、孝武太宗之威震四裔、爲我中華民族最光榮之時代、今復命名西京、蓋取鑑往勵來之意也、</p>

<p>申時社云、滬市近日來、以四底迫近、日前又因永興同泰兩匯劃莊相繼宣吿淸理、致引起市面之不安、但此種情形、經當局者盡力維持、並由中交等各大華商銀行以實力援助、實行鉅額抵押放欵後、此種不安情形、已完全消滅、昨據申時社記者向各大銀行方面調查所得、最近銀行方面放出抵押放欵、總額已超過二千萬元以上、計中國銀行約九百萬元·中國中央交通三行聯合放出約八百萬元、交通及四行準備庫約五百萬元、其他上海·中南·金城·大陸·各銀行、亦均有百萬元以上之放出、其利率每千元大多均在日息二角以內、</p>
<p>長期轉期　銀界實行　四底難關、距今僅四日、昨據記者調查、此次難關、確已可安然渡過、所有到期之五千萬元長期貸欵、除五金帮酌還半數、及客帮因永豐之收賬、已先後歸還者外、其餘四千萬元、大部可循例轉期、惟利率須酌量增加、大約較上期增高半元左右、按上期息價爲八元、關於巳成交者、錢業方面尙無所聞、銀行界方面、最近確已有若干鉅額借欵、准予通融轉期、如浙江實業·上海·中國·交通·等銀行、聯合放與厚豐公司約五十萬元、利率月息八厘五毫、又中國銀行放與木行業一百二十萬元、利息八厘七毫半·中國銀行放與猪行業三十萬元、利息八厘七毫半、故預料未來三日中、將續有大宗借欵實行轉期、故昨本市市塲人心愈趨安定、</p>
<p>錢業市塲　已趨緩和　昨日、錢業市塲之交易情形、已更趨緩和、劃頭加水、已跌至二角五分以下、惟拆息開價、較前日反漲高數分、錢業方面所做之押欵利息、日息旣僅有二角、故市塲日息較高、乃爲意中情形、幾已恢復舊狀、據悉、缺單之各莊、刻多數均已設法籌定足額、是四底難關、准可安然得過矣、</p>

<p>中央社云、暹羅當局、對於華僑所施行種種苛例、實使華僑受極大之難堪、故我國人士、對於暹羅當局、均表示不滿、中央社記者、特分訪各方探視其態度如下、</p>
<p>糧食界意見　中暹原爲毘鄰之國、且在商務上亦有極密切之關係、據本埠糧食界鉅子表示、暹羅係農業國、出產以米爲大宗、佔出口總値三分之二、而暹米運往中國者爲數不少、自去年華僑何德孚返國、與本埠糧食商一度接洽後、其進口之數量、驟見激增、按自去歲八月至本年三月止、暹米運滬者、其値達一千萬元之譜、暹羅當局旣不能善其鄰、而對我僑民、施以種種苛例、我國商民、惟有予以經濟上之打擊、我國年來、雖蒙受天災人禍之影響、以致農產不豐、猶待仰給於外國、但在外米方面、不購暹米、在我國毫無影響、且最近因我國經濟上之不景氣、暹米在我國市塲、已無銷路、故暹羅當局、如不改變其態度、當絕對不再購進暹米、</p>
<p>僑務界消息　復據僑務界對於此事認爲目前當局應急切訂立中暹商約、使我國與暹羅發生正當之國交關係、按遝羅原係我之屬國、卽最近過去之該國政府當道中、尙不乏國人占有重要之地位、故我國僑民陸續往該國經商者、達三百萬之譜、惟邇來暹羅當道、爲列强所縱橫捭闔於其問、故中暹間雖曾進行訂約之舉、但以暹羅當道之未有誠意、迄未實現、但以兩國之關係而論、至少限度之商約、必應於最短期促其訂立、暹羅當道因顧及自身之利害、及與中國關係之重要、應改變其態度、使中暹兩國發生友好之關係云、</p>

<p>— 陳高傭</p>
<p>李石岑著　世界書局出版　定價二元</p>
<p>這是石岑先生死後，最近出版的一本他生前的講演稿，內容有：中國哲學和西洋哲學的比較研究，儒家的論理觀，墨家的尙同說及其實踐精神，道家的宇宙觀，名家的觀念論的辯正法與刑式論理，中庸的哲理，什麼是理學，體用一源論，生的哲學等十篇。十篇之中第一篇中國哲學和西洋哲學的比較研究可說是一篇總篇，亦有說是他講中國哲學的方法論，所以我們祇要把這一篇一看就可知道他對於中國哲學是拿甚麽態度去認識，亦就可以知道他對於中國哲學之認識是否眞確。</p>
<p>李先生活的時候，嘗自以爲他的哲學見解是轉變了，由唯心論而轉變成唯物論了，而且還是「新唯物論，」卽辯證法的唯物論，但是我們從他一直至臨死以前所發表的文章及出版的書籍上，並沒有看出甚麼新的方法與見解，而且因爲多年唯心論的固定見解，忽然加了幾個所謂「新唯物論」的話句及名詞，倒算得有點「畫虎不成反類」狗了。這本「中國哲學十講」，似乎可以代表他轉變以後比較澈底的见解，所以如果僅就他個人的文章與書籍來說，這本書還可說是「李石岑的著作」，因爲所謂著作至少要本着一個「一貫的方法」對於所講的東西能有所「說明」然後可，若祗把許多事實理論排列叙述出來，那祇可說是「編述」，而不足以言著作。因此，我們說：若就李石岑個人出版的書籍來說，他的那些「人生哲學」，「哲學概論」都祇可說是「編述」，惟有這本書還可說是他的「著作」，但若按眞正的著作來說，這本書是否够得上著作的資格那又是　一個問題了。</p>
<p>這本書的內容完全是用中西比較的方法來作成的，所以他把孔子與蘇格拉底比，把孟子與柏拉圖比，把荀子與亞里斯多德比，把莊老與赫拉克里特比，把朱晦菴，王陽明與安葵奈斯，司苛特斯比，把宋明理學與經院哲學比，把王船山，顏習齋，載束原與康德，叔本華，尼采比，諸如此類，不必枚舉。這種比較的方法固然可以使讀者得到許多啓發，但是附會穿鑿之弊亦卽由此而生。我們知道「比論法」Anology是邏輯中最簡單最易犯錯誤的方法，所以非在極謹嚴的條件之下，非到不得已時，不能隨便用此種方法。宗敎家說敎最好用此方法，唯心論者談玄學亦最好用此方法，李先生講中國哲學處處用西洋哲學比較，固然比宗敎家與玄學家用譬喩的方法說敎講道高明了，但是未能超越極簡單極易錯誤的「比論法」則仍然也，質言之，卽終未能就事實與理論的本身分解說明使人把握住一個確實明瞭的觀念。如他把朱晦菴，王陽明與安葵奈斯，司苛特斯相比說：「可見他們的作僞心勞如出一輒」。（頁二二）又說：王陽明是一個極端的觀念論者，他覺得朱晦菴的觀念論還不够數。」（頁三三七）我們固不論朱晦菴王陽明與安葵奈斯，司苛特斯是否如出一輒，卽就王陽明與朱晦菴而言，爲甚麽，兩派能够對立，這還不是講中國哲學的人應當赶快給我們說明的一個極大問題嗎？而李先生則僅以「他覺着朱晦菴的觀念論還不够」一句話敷衍了之，若然，何須乎「講？」固然，李先生講理學的發生原因說：「富者愈富，貧者愈貧，……這也是推動中國哲學走上極端唯心論之「因」，（頁二八六）似乎是有點說明了，但是我們一想今日的世界上亦是富者愈富，貧者愈貧，却有唯物論哲學的風行，則覺李先生之說明仍是莫明其妙。</p>
<p>李先生亦自知！「從形式上看，中國哲學和西洋哲學確有許多相同的地方，可是談到實質，便有許多不同了（頁二七）但是我們讀罷全書，祗見他時時兩相比擬，却沒有看見他能對於中國哲學的實質確實說明，那末所謂「從辯證法方面觀察」，「從唯物論方面觀察」，「從辯證法的唯物論方面觀察」，（见第一講）亦不過一套時髦裝飾而已。</p>
<p>雖然，這本書在李著各書中還算是頂好的書籍，李氏已死，想讀李氏著作者，大可買來一讀。</p>
<h3 id="c147">讀「唯生論」 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 周毓英</p>
<p>正中書局出版定價六角</p>
<p>一般研究哲學的人，都承認人類精神的認識的發展可以分爲三個階段，即是：（一）獨斷的，（二）懷疑的，（三）批判的。但我們如將哲學的認識論與本體論聯繫起來，而合併起來觀察，那末哲學的本體論的發展也同樣可以分爲三個階段，那便是：（一）唯神論，（二）由唯心論到唯物論，（三）由實騐主義到唯生論。</p>
<p>本來我們在研究哲學的時候，認識論與本體論是不能機械地分開的。雖然若干學者在討論的時候，常常顧着了這一個而忘記了另外的一個，討論本體論的時候忘記了認識論，討論認識論的時候忘記了本體論，但實際上認識論與本體論之間的聯繫關係絕不會因學者們的忽略遺忘而被割斷開來。事實上，哲學的本體論的發展，牠的本身就是隨着人類精神的認識而發展的。譬如人類的認識在獨斷武斷的時期，一切自然現象與人類行爲的解釋，都只有由神來負責，神是最獨斷最武斷的東西，神便以說是宗教哲學的本體。</p>
<p>獨斷武斷的認識，到最後是動搖了，因為神並不能解釋宇宙的一切，速神的存在也發生了動搖。這時獨斷的認識與唯神論的本體，同時崩倒下來，便進到了懷疑的認識論與唯心唯物的本體論：這時期，人類從神的牢獄中解放出來，對一切事物都要加以懷疑，而對宇宙則愛加以解釋，於是唯心論唯物論便從這種懷疑的認識論下面產生出來了。唯心論與唯物論是從懷疑的認識論中產生出來的，但後來等到唯心論與唯物論的體系確定了後，心與物也變成了「神」，懷疑的色彩又减淡甚至於消滅了。</p>
<p>不過不論唯心論也好，唯物論也好，牠們終究還不能勝仟解釋自然現象及人類行爲的責任，於是人類的懷疑的認識便不得不進而爲批判的認識。認識論有了進步，本體論方面自然也要隨着進步了。在批判的認識論過程中，人類產生了科學，先有了自然科學，接着有了社會科學，對於自然現象與人類行爲有了各部門的科學來作分析的解釋，餘下的哲學的任務便是作綜合的解釋。於是所謂唯心論唯物論便不能不在科學之前畏縮退避，消聲匿跡了。「唯物乎？物在何處！唯心乎？心巳將死！」在這批判的科學的世界，陳立夫先生作這樣的嘆息實在不是偶然的。</p>
<p>人類的認識進到了批判的階段，唯心哲學唯物哲學不能再存在，於是實騐主義以及類於實騐主義的哲學便雨後春草似地發生出來了。實騐主義的哲學，牠在認識論方面仍帶着濃厚的懷疑主義的色彩，最多不過接近於批判主義。同時在本體論方面，有人說牠是二元哲學，其實我們還不如說牠是無元哲學來得恰當。實騐主義的哲學，正因爲牠是無元哲學的緣故，牠的本身便虛懸而無所歸宿，結果就只能永遠困守於懷疑主義而不能進展到正確的批判主義了。能夥正確的接受批判主義的認識精神的，這便只有唯生論。一生是宇宙的中心，民生是人類歷史的中心，」孫中山先生是這樣的確定了他的哲學的本體。同時對過去的哲學而論，一神」實在不過是生的象徵，而所謂「心」「物一也者，實在也不過就是生的兩面觀罷了。由生的這一面看去是心，另一面看去便是物，世界上决沒有可以孤立的心，也沒有可以孤立的物，唯心論者與唯物論者却硬要拉着半邊身體去孤立起來，歷史如果會說話，眞要高聲呌屈呢！</p>
<p>陳立夫先生這一部「唯生論」的出版，牠的功績不單鞏固了中國革命的理論的基礎。在牠的體系完全建立起來之後，我相信對世界哲學也會有着最偉大的貢獻呢？不過最後記者不能不引爲遺憾的，「唯生論」到現在還只出了一冊上卷，而在這一冊上卷之中，解說的系統又不十分朋白，讀的時候覺得非常困難，這不得不要求原作者極早圖謀補救。</p>

<p>領前　以後形勢、中央祇有追隨之力、恊興一路前導、惟相差祇二三、恊興周達雲建樹最多、中央則憑田劉一一將之功、雙方防禦禦甚可觀，上半時終了、協興二十五、中央十九分、下半時協興用替補員三人上塲、起初形勢、依舊極盛、相持不久、即由傳瑞祥速中二球、韓張各有建樹、中央劉田失勢、金飛崛起、連中三球、劉大觀再加二分、恢復原狀、成三十三比二十七、仍差協興六分、</p>
<p>緊迫　恊興雖以正式人員愉流調換、但卒以三預備軍作主體、故銳氣終難持久、中央咄咄逼人、步步爲營、劉大觀表演最佳、田康則得分最多、分數迭見追上、協興困於跋守、施展不得、局情乃益見緊張、最後中央賴劉田之一擲一罰、造成三十七比三十九、相差僅二分、惜時乎不再、中央即以二分之差、敗於協興、裁判戴昌麟、成績如下、</p>

<p>春秋　怪姓特刊</p>
<h3 id="c177">也來談談怪姓 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— （錢南鐵）</p>
<p>連日讀春秋所載怪姓錄，不覺技癢，鄙人對於希姓，也會略有記載，拙箸荔圓樓集中，附有希姓考一卷，計得百數十姓。今爲篇幅所限，恕不列舉，近來又有所得，約舉幾人，不知諸君能再來一下否？</p>
<p>淸進士題名錄上，順治時有「侶」鸞舉，雍正時有「秘」象震，乾隆時有「黏」克昇，光緒時有「力」鈞「水」鈞韶諸人，恐怕也屬怪姓之列了。吾邑常熟有「殷李」雙姓，股李堯光緒翰林，由給事中任至四川鹽茶道。廣西有「盤」珠祁，曾做某省廳長，聽說盤姓爲槃瓠之後，究竟確否，不得而知了。</p>
<p>江陰有六姓，係方孝孤後裔，現有「六」維釗，做浙江省立中學敎員。上海明星影片公司導演，前有「馬徐」維邦，又劉君所舉的浦薛鳳，乃常熟人，「浦薛」雙姓，至浦姓則各處都有，不足爲怪，順便糾正。</p>
<h3 id="c178">三箇怪姓 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 周縱橫</p>
<p>豆在淸人魏源譔的聚武記裏，因爲他要證明「漢書所言，關東出相，關西出將」那句話的不錯，所以舉了許多陝西籍和甘蕭籍的淸朝武將，間有一人名喚豆斌，下注固原人三字，官職雖沒有注明，但淸朝有這箇武將，大概是可稽的，他這箇姓也可算是怪姓吧。</p>
<p>理淸初有兩箇姓理的人，一箇呌理寒石，王漁洋蘇門三賢詩有句云：「西華理寒石，爲儒甘賤貧，奉母蓬　中，歸潔恐辱身。」即詠的是他，他原名　和，西華人，爲明朝的孝廉，本姓李，因爲恥與闖賊同姓，所以改曰理。一箇呌理洪儲，字繼起，揚之興化縣人，明亡，自稱南嶽和上退翁，也可算得是明末的一箇志士，他原本也姓李，其姓理的原因，在甲申之變以後，他貽書其子道：一吾始祖咎　爲理官，子孫因氏理，其後以音同亦氏李，今先皇帝死社稷、而賊乃李氏，吾忍與賊同姓乎，吾子孫尙復姓理氏。（見詰琦亭集）他二人在當時是「天下傳爲二理」的，而我們今日記此，非特以其姓怪，亦以其怪姓之中寓有愛國的成分，特爲宣揚，以羞煞一般附賊的人們呵。</p>
<p>國十年前認識一箇朋友，呌國愛葵，他是烟台人，也很喜歡動動筆，但有好久沒見到他的片紙隻字了，不知他的一切是怎麼一節樣子，我覺得他這箇姓，似乎也是很少的。</p>
<h3 id="c179">再來譚姓 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>秋子</p>
<p>近來春秋上關於性姓的文章着實不少，足見研究姓氏也是怪有趣的一樁事情，豈提倡「廢除姓界」的先生們所可同日而語？不過咱們中國那麼大，人口又那麼多，翻開歷史來看，古人姓氏本來就不止百家：從前蒙學讀物的「百家姓」，不過揀些放普遍的百家罷了。至於姓氏之怪與不怪，就我個人眼光觀察起來，是無絕對的標準。因爲你以爲怪，我以爲不性，我以爲怪，他又以爲不怪。這個地方很少的姓，認爲很怪，別個地方却是狠多又不怪了。古人「少見多怪」一句話，倒比較合乎邏輯一點呢！我現在再來譚一些少見的姓，讀者以爲是怪得很呢？還是嘸哈希奇？</p>
<p>（電）克明，陝西武功人，黃埔軍校第一期步科學生。（干）軍校第三期步科生有干城，號祖訓，浙江人。又工科學生有（閣）銘厚四川高縣人，（且）司典，號連五，四川大邑人，（留）羣，號効軍，浙江麗水縣人。第五期步科學生（鮮）熾賢，四川巴中人，（首）聯波，湖南郴州人。經濟科學生（便）振業，號偉如，江西永豐人。政治科學生（屢）一層，浙江人。（旋）冠一，號風，廣東龍門人。（卿）珪，號方舟，湖南武崗人。（雁）良圭，號藍山，亦湖南人。（滿）津浦鐵路浦鎭工務分段有滿運臣滿世明兩工人。（眞）津浦路總務處編查課課員眞恕方，山東蓬萊人。（暢）金元，河北天津人，津浦路剪票司事。（及）硯田，號禮耕，河北交河人，（勾）中賢，號公爲，江蘇江寗人，以上二位，均是津浦路車隊畏。</p>
<h3 id="c180">幾個百家姓外的姓 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— （伯深）（卻酬）</p>
<p>關於討論怪姓，已經有過幾篇了；這些姓，的確有許多是少見的；同時引起了不少讀者的興趣；我亦是其中的一個；所以搜集了幾個百家姓外的姓，來貢　給讀者們。　（禮）照槤，做過一部書，呌嘯亭雜錄；（展）書堂，現任八十一師師長；（檀）自新，在河南仟騎兵第十師師長，（耒）嗣勇，是浙江蕭山人，現在和我同校；（敬）肇謙，現任二十九軍憲兵司令：（喇）慶章，是四川成都人；（猶）國才，現任貴州任民政廳長；（原）頌周，前十幾年有一個江蘇兵災調查團團員；（達）慶寳，是江蘇六合人，亦和我同校；（果）海瀾，是查禁種煙特派員，現在福建；（承）觀佑，是蘇州同昌當裏的一個職員，現在不知道在不在；（福）至芳，是作者朋友錢君的同學。</p>
<h3 id="c181">怪姓談座 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— （一角）</p>
<p>我們故鄉的潮州，怪姓亦還不少。　饒平縣的複姓，有個（巫許），大名鼎鼎的張競生博士，他的前妻就叫巫許春姜，曾在省立第二師範學校念過書。伊的族人亦多，有人設是巫姓的人，給許氏兼祧，後來便姓成這巫許兩個字。這亦不能斷定。大概和中華醫局的陸費伯鴻，電影明星的馬徐維邦，都有些相似罷。僥平還有一個鄕村，住的都是姓（占），亦很特別。澄海縣的樟林鎭，姓（蟻）的洋客很多，汕頭開有茶葉店呌蟻興記。這塊龐大的招牌，使人十分注目。據他們說。。他的祖宗是二個海濱摸蛤的拜把兄弟，把結義的義字加上虫字，自成一族，這大概是無稽之談。其實呢，姓氏中確有這個姓，我在上海，亦曾見過，不過寫做古體字的螘，似乎較爲文雅了。廣州的怪姓，有姓（　）的，和喧字同音。廣東旅滬同鄉會會員，有（布）文策，（英）思友，（老）燕林，和一位（幸）舜華女士，這些姓亦是少見的。又同鄕友人潘謹齋，他的潘字，上半寫做米字，成爲（潘），不寫采字。據說是潘姓的支派，所以他印名片的時候很注意，非石印不可。因爲印鉛字，定要把鑄成的字弄去一撇，很不美觀。這和上海姓尤的一樣，電話簿尤字之外，還有少一點的（尢）公館，分爲三畫和四畫，如果不知這道理，翻遍簿子，决不會查出這尢先生，其實都讀做尤字的昔義。在戲劇界中怪姓最多，據我所知，北平已是不少。像鬚生的（貴）俊卿，（明）海山，（普）佑安，（支）鶴卿，（貫）大元，（時）慧寳，（恩）曉峰，小生的（德）珺如，武生的（遲）月亭，（瑞）德寳，花面美訥）紹先，（慶）春圃，（鞠）德奎，（福）小田，丑角的（慈）瑞全，靑衣的（茹）實蕙。上海新劇前輩有（達）天悲，現在改任虹口捕房的翻譯員。在上海招牌上的怪姓，要算（壬）昌泰香燭號和（於）震泰銀樓，這是大家所知的。南市有家紙店（性）和泰，它的主人姓性，恐怕大家還不曾注意，這可說是上海三泰的怪姓。有僩朋友王和任，向商務　館印名片，稿子寫得潦草，他把王字印成壬字，大約以爲是壬禺泰的貴宗。况且和他名字的任字，多少有些關係，所以不覺弄錯了。有人說：姓氏筆畫，愈少愈好，像丁卜一類，列名時往往在首排，如果姓（一），豈不大妙。其實一亦有姓，據康熙字典，明朝有個一炫宗，不但有一字的姓，就是（六）字亦有姓氏，我的朋友周文熙，他看到職員簽到簿的（六）子明，問他是陸還是樂，何必寫別字？其實列國，確有這個姓氏。又有朋友蔡劍痕，用一奶媽，伊說姓懎，他以爲是常州的常，我說這或者是左傳　人的後裔，因爲廧和懎是一字的。</p>
<h3 id="c182">我的怪姓談 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— （淸癯）</p>
<p>吾們嘉定城裏，以前有一家點心店，他一位老闆姓（元），這一僩（元）字，大家念若「鶻，」他的店號，原來是（元德盛，）所以就叫他爲『鶻德盛；」西門外有一家印佛馬（即神模，）的紙店，他的主人姓（迮，）名（華卿，）不過現巳去世了；廣福有一位姓（羗）的，他的大號呌（梓生，）在上海開一爿米行，就是協昌德裏的老大先生；去年，南翔公安局裏的分局長，他姓（閉，）名叫（修昭，）姓（閉）的實在難得碰着，恐怕舍了這一位分局長，隨便那一處也找不到了！</p>
<p>以前在上海，吾曾經碰見一個朋友，請敎他的尊姓，他說是姓（信，）吾初起聽了，眞想不出這個字音來，以爲必定是（孫）的轉音，或者是（荀）的誤訛，因爲他是北方人，一時不能十分淸楚，後來他從袋裏摸出一張片子來，背面還印着兩行紅色的小字，呌（書年，）號有穀，順天東安舉人，）我方纔明白，這位朋友姓（信，）名（書年，）號（有殼，）是前淸的一位孝廉先生，還有山西第三監獄署裏，有一位科長，前幾年託人到上海保壽險，他的姓，眞覺得奇怪，姓（遆，）名（仁輔）一時，而且要念這個字的音，也不能正確，從字典裏去翻尋，纔曉得他是姓（遆，）就是「提」的音；還有姓（朶）的，也曾經和他同過事，不過這一位朋友的名字，巳不能記憶了，似乎是雲南人，在昆明縣裏很有名聲的，他的父親，名呌（如正，）還是丙子年恩科進士；姓（朶）的，眞也不可多得啊！</p>
<p>有一天，我翻到某公司的一部紀念冊，裏頭也有許多奇怪的姓，像（支懿齊，）（楚步洲，）（牟愼修，）（笪耀先，）這四個姓，也是少見，五行中，像（金）（水）兩姓外，（木）和（土，）都沒有見過，獨在春秋上面，時時刊出（火雪明）的大作來，那末，姓（火）的，倒也是一個寡二而少雙的姓氏哩！</p>

<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>輕陰薄雨洗街塵，一席雄談見性眞，快事快人成快語，良朋良眷醉良辰；淸言直欲追三復，美酒何妨拼百尊；樹老春深詩意澹，重尋佳會欵嘉賓。</p>
<h3 id="c185">同學們的怪姓 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 皇天</p>
<p>本　上會登過椀公先生和公民言先生關於怪姓的記錄，看起來非常有趣。手邊恰巧有一本同學錄，順便拿來翻翻，也發現了幾個怪姓，現在寫出來凑凑熱鬧罷。「臘」河南浙川人。「曲」山東牟平人。「水」江蘇嘉定人。「掌一江蘇阜寗人。「鞠」江蘇泰輿人。「時」安徽壽縣人。「苟」四川人。「且」四川人。這些都是很少見的姓。尤其是最後這兩位，假使其中一位苟先生和另一位且女士結婚，這兩位「尊姓」擺做一起，眞是妙不可言。</p>
<p>我在小學時有一位同學是姓「池」的。據一位雲南的同學說，以前雲南有一位師長姓「那」的，這位「那」師長的祖先說是西藏人。現在廣西有些人是姓「鷄」的，據廣西土人說，姓「鷄」的纔是眞正原來的廣西人。廣西還有些人是姓「儂」的，說是南蠻王儂智高的後裔。</p>
<p>怪姓的搜集不單止是一件有趣的事，每一個怪姓必有它的系源，大概邊疆各省的怪姓較多，這是因爲和其他民族混雜的原故。假使將每個怪姓的族譜研究，看它們的來源，這在人類學上是一件很行意思的工作。</p>

<p>— 象賢</p>
<p>日來本刊，關於「怪姓」一事，討論得甚爲熱烈，由椀君首發其端，公君劉君繼之，象賢不賢，也來」附驥尼，所謂益發成全了美事；未知春秋的「無冕皇上」瘦鵑先生，「以爲然否」？（謝謝你封我做皇帝，但是我怕革命，怕上斷頭臺，不敢拜領，編者戲註）憶昔當年讀書所得，以及十年同窗之中，不無奇特之姓氏發現，爰筆之如下：</p>
<p>「禽」禽滑釐，墨瞿弟子，嘗學於子夏，與墨翟齊稱。「列」列子名禦寇，鄭人，與鄭繆公同時，書凡八篇，名列子。「鼓」靜齋隨筆：「……布商鼓子明，孔武有力，格匪首，得免於難」。「典」典韋」，三國中魏之名將，爲曹操心腹。「灌」灌嬰，漢之士大夫，害賈誼失公卿之位，即是此人。「景」景差，楚之辭賦家，成名於屈原投汨羅之後。「路」路溫舒，漢之廷尉史。「喜」喜常，列仙傳：「喜常爲周大夫，……後與老子俱適流沙」。「惡」惡來，商紂之大夫，史記：「惡來有力，以力事王」。「縣」縣子碩，與高何俱爲齊之暴者，指放鄉曲，學於墨子，遂爲天下顯人。「騶」騶衍，路史云：「小邾子後，周有騶衍騶忌騶奭，時號三騶」。「宰」論語：「宰我問三年之喪期已久矣」，宰我一作宰予，爲孔子弟子。「微」微子啓，殷紂庶兄，紂淫亂，數諫不聽，遂去之，周公諫武庚命微子代殷後，國於宋。「離」離朱，黃帝時人，百步見秋毫之末，孟子作離婁。「師」師曠，晋大夫，奏樂能致鬼神。「惠」惠施，六國時辯士，其學出自「別墨」。「苦」苦獲，莊子天下篇：　「……南方之苦獲，己齒，鄧陵子之屬，俱誦墨經」。「　」　錯，漢穎川人，學申商刑名，文帝時爲太子家令，以辯才得幸，後吳楚七國反，景帝用爰央之言，給錯載東市殺之。「盆」盆徹，山西產，昔日同學，敏捷過人，惜不壽而夭。「芟」芟林生，家之莊夫，淮北產，其族多亡失。「趡」趡花人，廣西邕寗人，亦爲昔日同學，畢業後不知其何適。頃讀大日報，上刊上海律師題名錄中，有一邊嘉祿律師，此姓不多見。最新成名之電影明星貂班華，此姓亦不多見。再有十二日劉君之「談姓」一文，中有「菱」氏一條，下注：本報常有一位投稿者，叫菱湖昭，按菱湖昭爲同學沈君之筆名，非其眞姓，將來有心人編起「怪姓錄」來，當刪去此條</p>
<p>春秋連日登載的「怪姓，」我覺得很有研究的價値，故特前來貢獻數姓，以供讀者諸君參考：</p>

<p>— 江盛世</p>
<p>（一）總論</p>
<p>短波收音機的成功與否，常須看他另件的質地和効力是否優良。有些另件，雖然對於廣播收音機是很適合的，但是却不能用於短波接收。本文並不述及短波收音機或其另件的設計，但希望對於讀者選擇另件時稍有帮助。</p>
<p>圖一甲是收音機中極普通並聯諧振電路。初看這電路中僅有一自威量Ｌ及一電容量Ｃ似很簡單但稍加研究，卽知其不然。在諧振時，Ｌ的　阻是2nfL.，Ｃ的電容　阻是：，互相平衡。這時電路中的電流可由歐姆定律求得。與直流路中一樣卽</p>
<p>在並聯電路中，　爲外來加於電路中相當的歐姆電阻（圖一乙）。</p>
<p>我們知道諧振時電流最大，若乘以Ｌ或Ｃ的　阻，就得到圖中ＡＢ二端間的電壓，而輸入於眞空管。但是實際上綫圈和電容器都有損失，所以　不能略去，任何電流通過　時都發生能的損失。短波另件的目的卽在使這個相當電阻减至最小，換一句話說，卽使這電路的損失减小。</p>
<p>這電路諧振電壓放大的倍數，常等於綫圈迥阻znfL對於電阻　的比，所以　愈小，放大的倍數愈大　但須注意者，就是　的値隨週率而變，並不一定。故實際上對於許多不同的週率不能得到相同的放大倍數。</p>
<p>（二）减少誘電損失（Dielectricloss）</p>
<p>短波綫圈効力高者，可做得小些，以限制他外而的電塲。繞線圈的支架須擇誘電損失小者？</p>
<p>可把綫圈繞在凸筋式支架上，使導一綫與支架儘量遠離。</p>
<p>又當一綫圈與一電容器並聯如圖甲時，發現綫路的本身週率並不是</p>
<p>但較這値爲低。因爲綫圈Ｌ並不完全是自威量，同時也有少許電容最存在的綠故。在綫圈每轉間，都有電容量存在。所以一個綫圈實際上含有很多串聯的小電容量，他們分佈在綫圈各導綫中間，因此在高週率時，有一部分電流並不流經綫圈，卽由此旁路通過，而發生損失。這電容量可視作與電容器Ｃ並聯，故能將其本身波長增加。這個電容量稱爲綫圈的自身電容量，若其値爲Ｃ1，則此配諧電路眞正的本身週率是</p>
<p>要减少這種損失，可在綫圈每轉間留下等於導綫直徑數倍寬的空隙，以使其自身電容量减至很小。</p>
<p>柵極綫圈的轉數以能與配諧電容器配合得所需要的波帶爲佳。再生綫圈，如需用的話，則愈少愈佳，使其恰能發生振盪，以減少其對於配諧綫圈的影饗。大概而言，再生綫圈約等於柵極綫圈的一半或三分之一。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c203">廣播電台徵求聽眾意見的新方法 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>廣播電台的節目，當然是隨聽衆的意見而轉移的。普通電台徵求聽衆意见是利用通信的方法，這方法第一很費時間，而且大多數聽衆懶於寫信，結果當然不好。就是利用電話來徵求意見，亦不妥當，因爲若是全體的聽衆同時打觀話來，電台上根本就無法應付。因此無綫電專　就從事研究，以求解决這困難，到現在初步的工作已經完成了。</p>
<p>一天美國ＷＲＯ廣播電台在音樂節目完舉後，報吿員報告：「請現在本城收聽本台節目的，開亮一只四十瓦特的電燈，開後隨卽關去」。數分鐘後　報告：「請喜歡這節目的，亦照樣的開一下電燈」，最後報吿員又請不歡喜這節目的開了一下電燈。（如甲乙二圖）不到一分鐘，電台上巳經知道本地的六萬人民中，有百分之十在收聽，而這時收聽的人中，百分之九十五對於這節“表示滿意。</p>
<p>這種徵求意見的新方法，是紕約無綫電專家霍潑金斯氏（Hcpking）發明的。原理很簡單，因爲當幾千幾百個聽衆同時開上一個電燈，電廠的負載（load）當然發生很大的變動，這種變動就由「自動記錄器」記下（如丙丁二圖），播音台中特備一具副的自動記錄器，從這記錄器記下的三次變動的大小，電臺上就可以算出上而三個問題的答案，換句話說，就是可以知道聽衆的意見。</p>
<p>此外霍氏又設計一種「無綫電選舉記錄器」用來記錄會議時對於一議案的贊成或反對的票數。（當然亦可移爲別種相當的用途）原理亦很簡單：是在議員席前面裝一短波天綫；後面設一短波發射機，發射電波；每一個議員各有一小杖，上面裝一單圈的環狀綫圈，柄上有一撳鈕；鈕向下撳則綫圈成爲合路，而一部份電波被吸收，席前的天綫受到的電波就减少；這减少的數目可以從特製的電表讀出，而知道反對或贊成的人數了。</p>
<p>無綫電是進化的，其新用途新器物日有發現，要在能努力研究耳。</p>
<p>附圖甲，報吿員發出問題，徵求聽衆意見；乙，聽衆依法發表意見；丙，電廠中的自動記錄器記下聽衆的意見；丁，記錄的一頁，最高峯代表當時收聽人數，中峯代表贊成的人數，最低峯代表反對的人數。</p>

<p>— 學綸</p>
<p>初學裝配收首機者，每苦於新式眞空管之號數繁多，缺乏選擇能力，因而失收者，更不在少數，所以鄙人曾作初進同志應具之知識一文，陸績刋載本報，因篇輻關係，未將綫路圖一一刊出，又恐初進同志，不能完全明瞭，故再將擴充方法，以及綫路圖詳加說明，籍作裝配收音機時之參考。</p>
<p>當設計一收音機時，首須解决電源問題，如前所述，茲爲便利計，祇就六。三弗打的眞空管繪圖解釋，因此種眞空管爲汽車管，構造堅固，經濟耐用，且耗電極省，所以適宜於交直流兩用，較他種眞空管便利也。</p>
<p>現在假定設計一收音機，將來須　充至一級高放，一級檢波，一級强力低放，及一級整流，眞空管採用三九或四四號高放，三六或三七號檢波，三八或四二號强力低放，及八〇號全波整流，底座最好用鋁板，但乾燥三夾板亦可用，底座之體積與零件之位置，如圖一所示，將來擴充地位，已一一留出，卽調節週率之變量電容器，亦以預購雙連者　佳。</p>
<p>（一）單管機之開始裝配</p>
<p>單管收音機本用强放管音量較響，但因加高低放時須更動綫路，故不如逕用檢波管爲簡捷，現採用三六號簾柵管檢波，回授以調節簾　電壓控制之，故震盪穩定，靈敏度亦較三七號爲高，接綫方法如圖二所示，</p>
<p>Ｌ用一又四分之一吋內徑蛛網板一　塊，二十八號漆包綫十二圈，起　端接地，卽用銲片套於固定蛛網　板之縲釘上，末端接天綫。</p>
<p>Ｌ1同上尺寸蛛網板一塊，同上漆包　綫八十四圈，起端如上法接地，　末端接調節電容器之定片。</p>
<p>Ｌ2同上尺寸蛛網板一塊，同上漆包　綫三十圈，起端接屏極，末端接　高阻圈。　　Ｃ·〇〇〇三五兆分法拉特雙連變　量電容器一只，中雍二二二一號　，連緩旋刻度盤。’</p>
<p>Ｃ1·〇〇〇二五兆分法拉特柵電容、器一只，中雍或信記出品。</p>
<p>Ｃ2·〇〇〇五兆分法拉特旁路電容　器一只，信記出品。</p>
<p>Ｒ二兆歐姆柵漏，亞美出品。　　Ｒ1十萬歐姆電位器，調節音量之用　須上等歐美出品。</p>
<p>ＲＦＣ八十五千分亨利高週率阻流　圈，亞美或中雍出品．</p>
<p>Ｖ三六號眞空管一只，亞爾西愛或雷聲牌，五脚板下管座一只．</p>
<p>零件配齊，卽可按照圖一之位置，用縲釘固定之，再依圖二之綫路，一一銲接堅固。三塊蛛網板互用絕緣紙隔開，相疊而釘於底座之下。倘回授力太强，可將L2拆去數圈，反之加繞若干圈。甲電用電鈴變壓器，或六弗打而蓄電池，或四瓶乾電供給皆可。乙電則宜先用九十Ｖ乾電。此機裝配無誤，可用五吋揚聲器收聽中央與本地電台。（待續）</p>

<h3 id="c212">聖經在中國銷數大增 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>在這天災人禍，內憂外患，交相煎迫的中國，想不到耶穌的聖經銷數會特別好。據報載，英國及外國聖經公會報吿，去年中國聖經銷數特別好，較一九三三年增三九四，二〇〇冊，共售去四，二九六，四九五冊。這從聖經的營業上說來，不能不算是一個好消息。</p>
<p>聖經所以去年在中國銷數特別好，這一，面證明，中國人民，一般地在水深火熱止過日子，沒有出路，他們祇能以聖經來作安慰寄託的所在，自求其精神上的麻醉。這倒是聖經所以去年在中國銷數特別好的原因罷。庋之，因爲聖經銷數特別好，中國人民都希望在腦筋中找求他們理想的樂園，因之把眼前痛苦却都忘了，這對於中國民族前途，却倒未必是一個很好的消息。中國民族現在似乎應需要一服奮興劑，而不需要什麼理想的樂國。</p>
<p>去年的聖經不獨在中國銷數特別好，在其他各國，也都同樣增加。據報吿，德國就增加了一，九〇〇冊。這更說明了各國人民都在苦悶現狀下怎樣希望能够達到他們理想中的樂園呵。可是這樂園却是永難達到的。世界人民怎樣把現實的痛苦從眼前推閒呢？這倒成了問題了。</p>
<p>聖經在世界的一般銷數增加，這决不是說明世界人民日有進步，思想日佳，而正是反面說明世界人的苦悶與消沉。然而聖紑究竟能不能挽救得　他們的靈魂呢？這是很難說的。也許有若干人正在拿耶穌的肉當麵包耶穌的血當葡萄酒呵，我們看多少人爲這東西而埋葬了自己。聖經正在被若干人和槍砲一樣的運用着，而收了若干世界安定的功效。他之被歡迎决不是偶然的。</p>
<p>然而淸凉的鎭定劑事實上是醫不了我們滿身的創痛呀。這結果又將怎樣呢？</p>
<h3 id="c213">挹江樓上 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 燕</p>
<p>官河從水關下衝出吊橋，一個轉折，向下塘流去。挹江樓就在急流的交點，在石壩上築起一所全縣最高的樓來。但是這並非是個名勝所在，河道上僅是幾艘柴船出進着，挹江的宏壯的名字，是老茶客們有天忽然想到之後，就那樣地懸起這橫額來。</p>
<p>每天到挹江茶樓來的，都是縣中有數的人物，他們自己帶來臥椅或睡榻，茶壺，茶葉也是照自己所喜歡的請茶博士保管着。他們到茶樓來彷彿上辦公廳似的有一定時刻，茶博士他記憶得最淸楚，如果有意外的訪客，他可以預測某老爺幾分鐘之後就要到了。設若眞的有位少爺或爺二天不上茶樓，，第三天早上茶博士去登門拜訪了，下午他把探得的結果報吿給另外的爺們聽。茶博士要有這一手本領自然是尋常人所能勝任的」他是滿淸時一位知縣的隨從，現在已是五十開外的年紀了，他混得了挹江樓的爐子，據說化了一筆相當的本錢的，所以他巴結那些爺門歡心之外，他更有驚人的賺錢本領</p>
<p>每年春天，爺們的賭興落市了，大概是元宵節之後，挹江樓總有新的玩意兒從小碼頭請得來，改良申曲、蘇灘，或是女子彈詞等，以佐爺們有意時的高</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>興，至於維持風化的當局早已有爺們的關節。每天晚上，樓上的電炬通明，有尖嬌的喉嚨唱着，有粗大的喉嚨笑着，幾個倒拖著警棍，出現在樓梯旁的黑衣警察，喝着不化錢的香片茶葉，聽到得意的時候，不由地大笑起來，把自家的職務忘了個乾淨。</p>
<p>今年的賭局意外地延長得二月中旬，雖然抽頭也是一筆可驚的欵子，但是茶博士却每天設法把賭局停止，他已接洽定當一件油水厚厚的玩意兒。他　到最有力的一位爺們商議，第二天就開腔起來了。他說從前到過這裏的花笑容的女兒現在長大得更見漂亮了，他說他老婆在什麽碼頭上見到她，他說那個茶樓每天上牌門阻止後來的聽客，他說花笑容很想再到本地來，他說，諸位爺們喜歡聽聽嗎？</p>
<p>果然，這消息把入局的爺們引起了很大的注意，他們想起花笑容的笑容，那時候她孩子只有十來歲，比母親更漂亮，有的計算着這孩子應該是幾歲了。牌局自然無形的停止了，大家回到躺椅里打着各自的注意，年老的向年輕的飄着嫉妬的目光，年輕的同樣向年老經的飄着嫉妬的目光，他們都想把那女孩子奪到手里來。</p>
<p>雖然在暫時靜肅下來的空氣里，可是一股比牌局更形熱鬧的情色是可以每個不安定的心中估計出來的。最後，自然是茶博士預前商議過的老爺們開口了。</p>
<p>「是呌花笑香的那孩子嗎？」</p>
<p>腔兒是那樣的乏力，好像他並不這件事似的，茶博士已是湊上了笑臉，故意壓著嗓子細聲地說：「是啊！那小妮子真有她的，比她母親出落得多呢！」</p>
<p>那悠長的尾音從空氣中送進了每一位爺們的兩個耳朵里，心里都是熱辣辣地，可是誰都不肯先一個贊成。</p>
<p>「大家還有興賭嗎？」依然是沒力沒氣地，然而沒有等誰接腔，又「那也好的，大家換換口味兒。」</p>
<p>「是的」，茶博士呌了起來。</p>

<p>壽興哥的大女兒阿銀，年紀約莫七信歲，臉龐紅暈得像關帝廟裡的關老爺。氣喘喘的，從花巷里直到屋後的豬欄邊來，眼角吊兩串眼淚。她愛不了阿花的奚落，她的眼底里覺得阿花現在倒神氣了，有着新奇好玩的洋火車，然而阿花的爸和她的爸爸都是同樣的是個「番客」，為什麼爸爸不帶給她一架比阿花的來得大而又好看的洋火車呢？這問題不住在阿銀的稚小的心坎里盤旋，她拉着她的媽媽的衣角，呶呶地訴說着。</p>
<p>「討債的死鬼，年紀又不算少了，還老在這里糾纏，你沒有爸爸已經死掉。……去！把鴨子趕到後池去洗個澡。」媽媽豬欄裡的豬，吃得飽到有點惰洋洋了，就放下手里的竹瓢，回轉過頭來，手指沉重的，恨恨地在阿銀底頭頂上敲着，嗓音像一只敲破了的銅鑼。阿銀哇的一聲哭出來，接着，影子就在屋後消逝了。</p>
<p>一提起阿銀的爺爸，壽興嫂就有點生氣了。她緊緊地怨恨壽興哥的無情義，一直「過」了七八年「番」，一封家信也沒有寄來，錢更不必說了，丟着她母女倆在家里受苦，她時時在自怨命里舛苦，嫁着不長進的丈夫，害她一輩子鎖困在家裡守活寡，受苦頭，讓青春飛逝去了。可是，上月村上的「水客」麻皮老二却跑到她的家里來告訴她，壽興哥決定乘下次的輪船回到　唐山了。這突如其來的消息，意外地使壽興嫂感到無限的快樂，那久不曾看見死去了的笑窩，又重新的浮泛上她那滿堆着深刻的皺摺的黝黑的瘦臉上了。</p>
<p>壽興嫂自從有阿銀在肚子里的時候，壽興哥就扔了她在家里，收拾着他的簡單的行李去過番，臨出門的時候，他還告訴她不久就要請「水客」麻皮老二來接她到番邦去快樂，可是，一直過了幾年，一點消息都沒有，連平安信也沒有寄來，彷彿有如一片石頭沉在茫茫的深海里，聽不到一聲音響的。這使壽興嫂的心里像熱鍋上的螞蟻般的焦急，她幾番幾次到村上新從番邦歸來的番客家去探詢，也都人言人殊，有的說：「壽興哥已飄流到巴內去當「豬仔」了！」有的說：「壽興哥已討了有錢的番婆在番邦過着快活的日子了！」從此，壽興嫂就守着她的女兒阿銀，過着陰沉凄慘的生活，她沒有快樂的春天，沒有照顧她的親切的親人，除了隔了很久長的時間，她的龍鍾的母親從山內出來巡視她們一下子之外，陪伴她們的養活她們的就是那幾隻豬和一羣雞鴨了。她們真是世上最孤獨不過的可憐人呵！</p>
<p>當「水客」麻皮老二到她的家里來告訴她壽興哥回唐山的消息之後，她匆忙地洗滌房里陳舊的傢具，不時地臉龐上背地里會浮泛上朶朶輕鬆的淺笑，雖則她還在躭心着壽興哥會帶來一個花嬌妖嬈的番婆，來爭奪她的寵愛。然而，一想到壽興哥這次的回來，最少皮箱里也得帶來一千幾百塊亮光光的的番洋，給她吐一吐幾年來滿存在肚子里的悶氣，讓她過著舒適的生活，在親戚的面前，揚揚一下志氣哩！可是，畢竟出了壽興嫂意料之外，壽興哥却依然地帶著他出門時的簡單的行李，和帶著疾病的身軀跨進了家門。</p>
<p>「怎麽這樣地狼狽呀？天呀！」壽興嫂的美夢變成泡影了。「我眞個苦命的人！」壽興哥却連一句話也說不出來，把身子橫躺在新洗滌過的睡床上，頻頻地嘆著。……</p>
<h3 id="c215">暮春掇拾 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>（快車緊緊地鉗住了二條永久成並行綫的鐵軌，發了狂似地死命地向着沒有盡頭的路衝去：奔過土丘，奔過泥沿，奔過田野，奔過墳場與果樹林，奔過充塞了思慮的成簇的人家。</p>
<p>是黃昏了，灰暗的天空中擠滿了好多死沉沉的水分，陰天哪！而且，又是陰天的黃昏——陰天的黃昏，就連宇宙間頂活躍而熱切的太陽，都陰沉如古哲人，儘是躱在重重的灰雲裏面，安份地走着自然之規律所給予的暮年之必然的沒落的命運了。一切都是死沉沉的：桃花帶着焦黃的烙印冷冷地飄落到水面上，杜鵑失了神地用着衰老的嗓音啼出一兩聲：都快哪！一切好的，金色之夢幻一般的日子都已飛快地直到了盡頭：日暮了，春也暮了。</p>
<p>而况，這又是個沒有多少好日子的春天。不是嗎？整個的春天是全在不斷的風風雨雨中浪過去了；地上的泥濘，人底心頭也是泥濘——有人說：這時代，難有好日子過？這時代，連春天都是不值得去追戀與惋惜的啊。）</p>
<p>那麽着，我便企圖從此能爽快地忘掉了自家兒的一些苦難的青春的日子，與此後的不値錢的遺憾似的對於過往的「黃金時代」的傷悼吧。</p>
<p>當瞧着人家把這些可驕傲的青春溶消在銀色的戀情裏，爵士音樂中的迷人的「薩克蘇風」的音響裏，作爲智識之金字塔的偉大的學府裏，或耀目之生活的過分的享受裏的當兒，我幾乎要開始懷疑自家兒是也有着所謂青春的日子的這一種惠實了——正如一個從多雨之鄉長的成的北國的土人，一旦走進了終年照着</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>樣：　　，且發呆了。</p>
<p>真的，北地的多雨且泥濘的陰沉。與南方的「風和日麗」的明朗是難以用想像來比擬的啊。而同樣地，當從一個灰色的，多風雨苦難的春天（一生僅有一次的春天啊）裏顛跛着來的人，他怎麼有想像另一個世界中的明朗之可能呢</p>
<p>說追悔與嘆息是無用的嗎？是的。但遊春的人，當落進了一個晦暗的春季而减了遊興的時候，還要追悔他底浪費了的車資呢，而况自己的車資便是生命——生命啊！</p>
<p>在這世界裏，不是也有好多的詩人與哲學家在費盡了心力給我們闡明靑春之可貴的嗎？然而這對於生活在另一個世界裏的人們是一點用處都沒有的。人，當接受了大自然所賦與的生存之本能，而另一方面，却又接受了大社會所賦與的先天性的不幸，於是帶了一個幼小的靈魂，而開始他底生命之長途旅行的時侯，還有誰再能去吟咪春天的風情呢？</p>
<p>這樣，就在用了幼小而無力的脚步，一步步地踏過濘濕的土路，又用了千萬種的留神與緊張去掇拾起被幸福的人們所棄下的生活之機會的一鱗一爪的時候，一個可貴的靑春便悄悄地溜過去了，像捉迷藏，像夜行的竊賊。</p>
<p>終於，偶然一抬頭：灰色的中年的門戶已頑固而陰森地立在我底面前了，自己已經在風雨中走到了靑春的盡頭，而把一些永遠不會再來的日子消蝕在風雨裏了。</p>
<p>春天是已經走到了暮境了；此後，在生活的夾道中，我將更去掇拾一點什麼呢？……</p>
<h3 id="c216">成年的雀 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>（現在，可不必再替這隻可憐的雛雀担心了，牠已不再對我們生怕，倔强，仇視。那應柔馴地抖開稚弱前翅翮，張着黃黃的小嘴，喳喞喳喞的吞下挑在竹片上的食物。我們喜觀得幾乎需狂跳起來。這可憐的小生命，似後也許就在這小小的竹籠裏長大起來、除了中間有着非我們人類所能給與的生理上的缺陷。）</p>
<p>我們的喜歡幷不是出於偶然與一時的好奇。那是在昨天午後，一陣大風雨過後，我們就發現一隻可憐的雛雀，垂着水濕的翅翮，蹲在籬笆下喳喞喳喞的呌得很凄哀。我們頓時給這呌聲撩起一股驚異的感動。當我們伸手去捉她的時候，牠那對小小的眼晴裏可射出一種恐懼的與憤怒的光，撲着小翅掙扎起來；這使我們一時獲豫不决把手縮回了。不過，牠的飛行能力究竟太軟弱了，爲了不忍心眼看着一隻小生命就此凍餉而死，終於把牠捉起來放在小隻小竹籠裏。</p>
<p>牠起初很倔强的，在籠裏跳着衝着，很憤怒的樣子。當我們走開去的時候，牠又喳喞喳喞地呌了。我們估量牠是餓着，就把食物挑在竹片上送到牠嘴邊去，逗牠吃；但牠幷不咧開嘴接去，翅膀一撲，瑟縮在籠角，小眼睛楞楞的望着我們，又不呌了。這樣一次二次三次，我們想盡方法去逗牠都不行；這使得我們很生氣，就把牠促在手裏，一手撬開牠的嘴甲把食物塞下去。看着牠儘力拉長頸子，眼睛一貶一貶的吞下塞在喉頭的東西，我們就担心到這可憐的小生命的前途是很暗淡的。</p>
<p>但是，現在可不用担心了。喏，牠已不再對我們生怕，倔强，仇視，喳巳把我們看作是牠的母親那麽樣。柔馴地抖開稚弱的翅翮，張着黃黃的小嘴，喳喞喳啷的接去挑在竹片上的食物。吃飽了就靜靜地躱在窩裏打瞌睡：肚俄了又跳出來，像跟牠的母親要索食物那麽，</p>
<p>我們　天跑到田野裏去捉些小滿虫、回　就一　一隻的挑給牠吃。可絕不會感到一些　瑣乏味；而且反給這平凡的生活平　工一道濃厚的典趣。這樣一天兩天的過去，牠的羽毛漸漸豐滿起來了。我們常常放牠出去；牠會從這邊瓦上飛到牆外的樹上去。有時，在太陽下斜開翅翮躺在瓦上，眼睛一閃一閃的晒太陽。那種閑怡的神情，眞叫我們看了愉悅羨慕。只要我們吹起口哨，牠又喳唧喳的飛下來，停在我們的手上，或肩上。我們從來沒有担心牠會飛出去不回來。我們所担心的是怕捉不到青虫和時時窺伺在屋角的狸貓。</p>
<p>這樣又一天兩天的過去。小雀的嘴黃已漸漸褪去了。有時我們雖然也會對於牠的調皮狡猾生氣，恨牠沒有往常馴服，但也還不至想到牠會飛出去，不回來。因爲到了晚上，牠仍然會回到竹籠裏來的。</p>
<p>可是，這可愛的小雀終於不再飛回來了！現在已經過了兩天。晚上的籠裏也是空洞洞的。我們試吹起口哨，雖然還不能看見牠從牆外掛上飛出，甩着尾巴站在瓦上跳。然而，牠的羽毛已豐滿了，翅翮已健壯了，牠自己已能够找到比我們給與牠的更肥美適口的靑虫，牠要用着牠年靑的力，到廣大自由的天地中去翱翔！牠已經是一隻成年的雀了。</p>

<h3 id="c220">關乎出名的衣架子亞道爾夫孟郁的瑣碎 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>亞道爾夫孟郁，大家都知道他是法國人。當然，他講法國話，比講英國話講得好。但是他在庫耐大學的時候，法文敎授竟給他兩次的不及格。這不是很奇怪嗎，但孟郁一生奇怪的事疋多，我們且慢慢地講來。</p>
<p>他的父親本來是開飯館的。他雖然供給他的兒子進了大學，但是他的兒子，從大學畢了業（亞道爾夫孟郁是否康耐爾畢業生，不詳），却不能不自求生活了。斯以，亞道爾夫就在一九一三年跑到紐約。那個時候，他口袋裏祇有七分錢。他想淮戲劇界。很巧的，他遇到了一個汽車夫，那個汽車夫介紹了他一個戲劇事務。這就是他第一次登台表演，薪水是每星期二十七元五角。</p>
<p>他做滿了一個星期，可是那二十七元五角，却始終沒有拿到，因爲戲班解散了。</p>
<p>後來他在紐約，遇到了一個公正影片公司的人員般主任。他答應了他有事做，但是公司却在南方福錄利達。於是他就雛開了紐約，跑到福錄利達。他去的角色，是要穿禮服的。也沒有禮服。他從前會向他父親的房東借用過禮服，但是現在沒有地方去借了。他的父親在他年齡滿二十一歲的時候，會給他一只鑽戒。他那時還戴在手上。他就褪了下來，當了六十五塊錢。</p>
<p>他將六十五塊錢，製了三套禮服，就是晨服，大禮服，和晚餐服三種。他租了一間小房間，付了一個星期的房金。身邊祇剩了五角錢。明天他興匆　地跑到公正影片公司去報到。可是那張影片宣佈停攝了！</p>
<p>公正影片公司在十一層樓，而在七層樓，却有一家靦斯影片公司。他坐了電梯從十一層下來的時候，他從玻璃窗裏看見福期公司門前聚了許多人，好像是在招考臨時演員似的。所以他就坐了電梯下去了，而原梯坐了上來。果然不錯，福斯公司要拍一張法國影片。他就站進了綫，挨着一個一個的走上去。忽然一個少年看見了孟都，老遠的他喊道：「喂！那個留小鬍子的！你興！」這就是他機會的開始，可算是無巧不成書的了。</p>
<p>他在福斯公司，雖不過是一個平凡的臨時演員，但公司當局，對他漸漸認識起來。有一天，名導演湯森叫了他去，給他一個腳本，叫他看看，問他去那個角色會不會？孟郁道：「會不會？吃吃得下去的！這樣，他就受僱了，薪水突然的從每天五元，一躍而爲每星期七十五元！</p>
<p>以後的事，無庸細說了。不過他現在已是一位大明星了。還有一件事，可以提到的，就是他以衣着最講究，著稱於好萊塢的。他所有的衣服，多得不計其數。據他自己的估計，大概有衣服兩百套，大衣約五十件，襯衫，帽子，鞋子，有終年看不到一次的。但是他初到好萊塢的時候，設了許多方法，才得到一個裁縫師，替他做了四套衣服，價欵分期拔還。到了現在，任何裁兵師倘得到了亞道爾去孟郁惠臨定製衣服，那是莫大的光榮，價欵多少更是在所不計了。</p>
<p>還有一件事，可以便中談到的，就是他的名字。你知道，亞道爾夫孟郁是他的眞名實姓。當他初進影界的時候，許多人　他改名易姓。一位大導演說：一你如果不成功，那就是你的名字葬送掉的。那種名字太笨重了。」頭溫糜爾苦苦地勸他更改，吿訴他沒有能够記住孟郁約。許多人說，看見了那個字，都不知道怎樣讀法。他說：「賈克勃萊！那就是你的名字，再好沒有了。</p>
<p>可是孟郁說：「賈克勃萊，請他到地獄裏去好了。」他現在成名了，非但大家能照着德文的讀法念他的名字，並且已是家傳戶曉，婦懦皆知的了。</p>
<p>你們不要誤會了。亞道爾夫孟郁並不是生活奢豪的人。他以衣著著稱，是他成名之道，必須維持下去的生意經。他個人是很儉樸的。他不用秘書。一切的影迷信扎，他都要親自拆閱答復的。他亦不僱用許多僕役。有人問起他，他很幽默的說道：「　人太多了，夫妻之間連一個太太平平吵嘴的地方都沒有了。」</p>
<p>他說夫妻難得吵吵嘴，却是一件閨房樂事云！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c221">評「無愁君子」 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>——金城映</p>
<p>在黑暗的電影院中，我偶然聽着一個女人的聲音在說：</p>
<p>「滑稽末滿滑稽格，苦末滿苦格。」就是這兩句很平常的話，對於「無愁君子，」似乎是很得當的批評。的確，作爲滑稽影片的一無愁君子」，在歡笑的外形之下隱藏着悲苦的人生，未嘗不是比較不平凡的藝術表現。</p>
<p>誰也會體念得出，劇作者對於被飢寒所逼的人們懷着極大的同情，他們無家可歸，他們在馬路上流浪，他們需要職業，他們有着良善的性格。但是殘酷的社會將他們逼迫到死亡綫上。在寒冷的冬天，他們想盡方法要生活下去；然而結果仍是失望。</p>
<p>在這裏，劉繼羣和韓蘭根是阿Ｏ型的都市的流浪者，他們善良，守本份，他們有着生活華貴或享樂的奢望，他們希望結婚，他們需要女人，他們會盡自己所有的能力去奉侍梅琳，雖然他們能够做到的不能超過高度的友誼。同樣他們也覺得看到跳舞塲忙亂的人羣，使自己頭昏眼花，他們到底以爲祇要有不漏雨的屋子，已經心滿意足。更殘酷的，他們扮者猴戲向入們討求同情，然而所得着的祇是五個銅板。不過劇作者也相信人們的良心未死，醫生或房東，到底也給他們的善良戚動了。</p>
<p>對於這一影片，我們所感覺滿意的，便是作者們並沒有給與觀衆有害的毒物。作者們有着善良的心，使觀衆們對於人生有些感喟，但同時對於這些善良的人們生活的解放，却也沒有指出一條明確的路，無非是對着美麗的春天美妙的懷想而已。</p>
<p>就演出形式來說，這裏充分的表現着作者對於電影藝術之深入的理解。但是，經騐却不免生疏，這是我們在各方面都可看得出來的。我們在這裏少能看到勞萊哈台式的滑稽，然而也少能看到含淚的歡笑之自然的流露。同樣，這裏的配音，比較其他配音的國片，在音樂和劇情的調和的一點上，頗能勝任，然而也不是極端純熟的表現，在Tempo上，這裏是想弄得更好一點的，可是導演却沒有充分的把搔，由於搖鏡頭太慢太長，似不適宜於喜劇的調子。同樣，兩個演員也不是喜劇的天才者。韓蘭根生硬約扮丑臉，過於做戲，襯出子劉繼羣的表演比較合乎人情。此外在剪接上，和其他國片一樣犯了嚕囌堆砌的毛病，至少我以爲有好些地方是應當剪得更短一點的。</p>
<h3 id="c222">評「生死關頭」 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>Society　Doctor——南京映</p>
<p>記得在易卜生的劇本「國民公敵」中，一位醫生爲了提議改良浴堂的用水而遭受社會人士的非難，甚至於把他當作公敵。</p>
<p>這裏「生死關頭」也寫了一位醫生，爲了拯救一個危急的病人，不管這位病人的父親怎樣反對，他毅然决然的就執行割治，結果使他脫離了危險。雖然本片的故事，並不是叙寫一位像易卜生所創造的英雄那樣有力量，對社會改良的熱情和反頑固觀念的戰鬥，但在故事前半部的形式却是有些相似的地方，所不同的是在本質方面。易卜生的「國民公敵」，是有着更深廣，更澈底的認識，牠是一直到底的。而「生死關頭」乃是狭小的，這醫生是沒有什麽認識的。就在這地方可以判別嚴肅的北歐藝術家，和庸俗的美國作家之間的差異了。</p>
<p>導演對於本片的處理，除了在割治時的空氣還很緊張外，可以舉出的成功之處却很少，但對於演員的支配，都還可以過得去。此外，還有如看護的偸着喝酒吃肉，醫生的醉舞等塲面，輕微地存在着對醫院的諷示，還相當的有意義</p>
<p>飾毛根醫生的CbestenMcrrio，在銀幕的演技上木來有相當的成就的，在本片裏他也並不曾使我們怎麼失望，可是這一個故事很顯然地限制了他，不然，我想他還可以更多施展藝才的地方。其餘的角色，似乎都被安置在次要的地位，不能有什麽特色。</p>

<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>正在這個時候，門鈴響了。那是一個街車的汽車夫。脫雷正說着話，他看見了汽車夫進來，他就突然的一言不發了。他看看愛梅，又望望那汽車夫。他默然的走了出去。愛梅看了他的神氣，不覺爲之戚然。她指着她的皮包，叫汽車夫提上了汽車。她一句話說不出來。她向停在門口的汽車走過去。她淚眼模糊，顚顚躓躓的上了汽車。</p>
<p>愛梅離開了脫雷，回到姑母家裏，但她時刻不能忘懷的，就是脫雷。她這樣度日如年的一天一天過着。她强迫着自己參加一切的宴會。她强迫着自裝裝着歡娛之色。無論在什麽地方，她，總是高聲的笑着，顯得她比別人快樂些，但她內心的痛苦，却祇有華德一個人看得出。他知道她是外强中乾的支持着，所以每次看見她，總覺得爲之惻然。他亦時常去看脫雷，、想和他理論，阻止他的狂妄的飛行，不顧生命的冒險，但是脫雷却置之　笑照舊的我行我素。</p>
<p>後來愛梅冉也忍耐不住。她不能離開說雷而生存。但是到了這個時候，脫雷已經不再聽人家的勸吿了。有一次愛梅看見脫雷閒着華德的汽車走過。她在後面呌着他，可是他將汽車開足了疾駛而去，那種危險的情形，使她不覺掩面不敢看，一個人哭泣起來。</p>
<p>那天晚上，愛梅家裏正舉行着一個宴會。愛梅穿着最華美的衣服，顯着最歡騰的態度。她一個人笑着說着。她說：「我爲什麽不快活呢？人生如朝露，行樂須及時。我現在已是生在雲天之中的人了！」許多人聽了她的話，有些莫名其妙，都不知道怎樣接口，祇可以跟着她笑笑。</p>
<p>忽然像睛天霹靂一樣，滿天的快樂都銷逝了。華德突然走了進來。他走到愛梅的面前，聲音顫顫然的說道：「愛梅……我和你……現在要到一個地方去……馬上就要去。」愛梅看了他一回，淡淡然的道：「我知道……一定是脫雷……出了什麽亂子了……」華德不覺頭低了下去。他說：「他駕了我的汽車……警局剛打電話給我……他在此地附近一個夜花園裏出了亂子。」愛梅聽了，一言不發的跟了他就走。</p>
<p>愛梅亦不知道她怎樣來到這個地方的。她祇知道脫雷受傷了。他的身體橫臥在花園中央一座寳塔裏的地上，一動不動，面色灰白得像紙一樣。愛梅走到他的身旁，就跪了下去。脫雷睜開了眼睛，四面張望着，不耐煩似的微微搖着頭道：「這些人鬼鬼祟祟的做什麽……他們當着我會死的嗎……是不是？我不死……我要死的時候……要等我好了……有了準備……在沒有準備以前，我是不會死的……誰亦不能叫我什麽時候死……」</p>
<p>愛梅忍住了眼淚，安慰他道：「當然不會的我的愛。」脫雷又說道：「等我死的時候，一定要死在天空之中……不會死在　髒這的地上的……汽車要不了我的性命的。」愛梅道：「當然不會的。」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Legislative Yuan Passes the Simple Life Insurance Law, Agricultural Warehouse Business Law, and Revised Civil Procedure Enforcement Law; Transaction Tax Rate Exemption for Bonds, Bid Money at 6 Cents Per Item <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 14th regular meeting on the morning of the 26th. Sixty-one members, including Zhao Maohua, were present. Sun Ke presided as Chairman, and Liang Hancao served as Secretary-General. The following matters were discussed: 1. The Postal Simple Life Insurance Law proposal. Resolved: In accordance with the review results of the Legal and Economic Committees, it was renamed the Simple Life Insurance Law and passed with amendments. 2. The Agricultural Warehouse Law proposal. Resolved: In accordance with the review results of the Legal and Economic Committees, it was renamed the Agricultural Warehouse Business Law and passed with amendments. 3. The National Bureau of Standards Organization Regulations proposal. Resolved: In accordance with the review results of the Legal and Economic Committees, it was deemed that each responsible agency already handles industrial standard matters, planning, and facilities. There is no need to establish another bureau to handle it, and this case should be postponed. 4. The Enforcement Law of the Civil Procedure Law of the Republic of China proposal. Resolved: Passed with amendments to the draft. As for the amendment to the transaction tax rate, the Yuan meeting discussed it, resulting in the merger of the first and second suspicions in Item A of Article 2 of the Exchange Tax Regulations, the third suspicion was changed to the second paragraph, and a third suspicion was added: Government-issued public bonds and treasury bills are exempt from transaction tax. The bid money for Item B was changed to 6 cents in national currency per item. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 26th passed various laws. The debate and important contents are as follows: (A) When deliberating the Simple Life Insurance Law, Xi Chaojun and Zhou Yizhi first reported on the review process, stating that the main purpose of this law is to provide relief to society and the working class, ensuring some security for their families after death, and it is not for business purposes. The methods specified therein mostly adopt Japanese legislative examples, all of which are simple and easy to implement. Subsequently, various committee members considered the originally stipulated insurance amount of 900 yuan to be too high and reduced it to 500 yuan. Regarding the clause that exempts the insured from physical examination, some advocated deletion, while others advocated retention. The deletion faction argued that public health in our country is underdeveloped, and the health of the nation is worrying. If the insured is exempt from physical examination, the mortality rate of the insured will inevitably be high, and the government will be overwhelmed by losses. The retention faction argued that the difference between simple life insurance and other insurance is precisely the exemption from physical examination. If this clause is deleted, the spirit of the law will be lost. Subsequently, the chairman announced a vote, and the majority supported the retention faction, maintaining the original proposal. There were few disputes over the remaining clauses. The law has a total of 38 articles, generally stipulating: (1) This type of insurance is a state-run enterprise, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, and other insurers may not operate it. (2) This type of insurance uses postal and remittance bureaus as insurers, divided into two types: whole life insurance and term insurance. (3) The insurance amount is limited to 50 yuan to 500 yuan. (4) This type of insurance exempts the insured from physical examination. All citizens of the Republic of China who are between the ages of 12 and 60 may be insured. (5) Other business procedures. (B) When deliberating the Agricultural Warehouse Business Law, Xi Chaojun and Chen Ruxuan first reported on the review process, stating that the purpose of this law is to regulate food and circulate finance, which is quite needed in the country at present. This law encourages and supervises the agricultural warehouse business in China. Then, the second reading began, with only textual modifications. The full text contains 26 articles, generally stipulating: (1) Those who operate the storage and safekeeping of agricultural products for the purpose of regulating the people's food and circulating rural finance may establish agricultural warehouses in accordance with this law. (2) The consignments of agricultural warehouses are limited to the main food produced by local farmers, but they may also store and keep other agricultural products. (3) Agricultural warehouses are not for profit and may also operate the processing, modification, packaging, transportation, and agency sales of consignments. (4) Other business procedures. (C) When deliberating the Enforcement Law of the Civil Procedure Law, Luo Ding, the convener of the drafting committee, first reported on the drafting process, briefly stating that when drafting this law, the chief officers of the Supreme Court and the Judicial Administration Yuan were invited to the Yuan for consultation, and the two agencies drafted proposals for the Yuan's reference. Now, after researching the cases together, the Civil Procedure Law Enforcement Law has been formulated with 15 articles. The main points are that after the implementation of this law, the Civil Mediation Law will be abolished, because the new Civil Procedure Law has fully incorporated the mediation procedure, and there is no need to separately order a single mediation law. If the appellant has a lawyer as a litigation agent, or it can be recognized from the records on the document that he clearly knows that there is a lack of appellate requirements, the court may not follow the procedures of Article 439, Paragraph 2, and Article 441, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Procedure Law, to prevent delays in litigation. As for the effective date of the new Civil Procedure Law, it is proposed to be reported to the National Government and set on July 1, so as to be in line with the judicial year. After the speech, the second reading began, and all were passed according to the original proposal. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Communications, the simple life insurance has been prepared. After the regulations are promulgated, it will begin to be implemented in July this year, starting with Shanghai and Nanjing. If it goes smoothly, it will be expanded to other provinces and cities.

<h3 id="e17">Where is the Path to Fisheries Revival? <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>It is heard that this year's spring fishing season has been greatly reduced due to the impact of climate, and the market has been sluggish, and sales have declined. The livelihood of fishermen has been doubled. The authorities are closely carrying out strict measures to prevent piracy in the fishing industry and are thinking about improving production and sales. Although there are still many plans in the works, since the development of fisheries and the improvement of the lives of fishermen are the goals, they will surely be realized one by one.</p>
<p>The difficulties encountered by China's fishing industry, those from external sources, are the Japanese invasion of fishing, taking advantage of their new equipment and powerful support to compete with our fishermen in the ocean, and selling at low prices in our country. The current tax rate has greatly reduced the import tariffs on seafood, making seafood imports smooth and affecting the domestic fishing industry. Those that are internal are that fishermen adhere to old habits and often lack both capital and materials. They cannot adopt new equipment, and the country's laws and regulations are becoming stricter, and various restrictions sometimes increase the shackles of fishermen. Recently, it was reported that the fisheries of 12 counties, including Weixian and Changli in Shandong, have been greatly reduced due to the invasion of Japanese ships and the shortage of fish and salt. Shandong needs more than one million dan of fish and salt annually, but the transportation department stipulates that only 420,000 dan are released, which is less than half of the demand. Salt is a preservative for fish, and fishing boats and salt cannot be separated. There have never been strict restrictions on fishing boats carrying salt. Therefore, even if ordinary fishermen do not catch much when they go to sea, they can use the surplus salt to make up for it. If they need to buy salt, fishermen already have small expenses, and if the salt quota is restricted, fishermen will lose their support and dare not go to sea rashly. This phenomenon is not only true for the coastal fisheries of Shandong, but also for the fisheries of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The restriction of fish and salt is to prevent private sales, but if the crackdown is too strict, fishermen will feel inconvenience. For example, in recent years, fishing boats must obtain licenses before going to sea, and those without licenses will be punished. However, ordinary fishermen often do not understand the licensing procedures and go back and forth, resulting in the loss of fishing opportunities. Judging from the fishermen's own ability, they are too weak to compete with others and have been eliminated. If the country does not fully protect them and provide fishermen with convenience, China's fishing industry may not be able to stand without the invasion of external forces.</p>
<p>As for sales, the equipment for transportation and the methods of promotion are far behind those of foreigners. Even in Shanghai, the fish market under planning has not been realized for a long time. Shanghai's fish market has a long history, with dozens of fish shops. Before the fishing season, fishermen often borrow fishing capital from fish shops in advance. After getting fish, they use it to compensate the fish shops. At most, the amount is as high as one or two million yuan. If the fish market is established, what will be the method for the fishermen to borrow fishing capital in advance? How will the fish shops recover the fishing capital they have released? This is also a big problem. Furthermore, what will be the status of fish shops after the fish market is established? What will be their relationship with fishermen in the future? This must also be resolved first. I believe that the crisis in China's fishing industry is deepening, and the relief plan cannot be delayed. However, legislation should be precise but not harsh, and reforms should be gradual rather than too rushed. Facts should be combined with theory, and the initial stage should not be blamed for its perfection, but should seek a way for innovation. This is what I hope that all parties related to the fishing industry will think deeply, cooperate fully, and build our new fishing industry.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Silver Price Soars: Our Country Suffers Direct Impact. Minister Shi Zhaoji Visited Hull Yesterday, Expressing Concern Over U.S. Silver Policy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Indicates Continued Silver Purchases. <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Minister Shi Zhaoji informally explained to Secretary of State Hull today the Chinese government's concern regarding the U.S. silver policy. Subsequently, Shi issued a statement to the press, stating that China is currently facing an economic crisis, similar to the situation in the United States in 1933. However, China does not possess the same resources to resolve these difficulties. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that the government will declare today that it will no longer raise the price of silver purchases. However, he also indicated that the United States will continue to purchase silver until the silver price rises to $1.29 per ounce, or until the silver reserves of the Treasury Department reach one-third of the value of its gold reserves. As for whether a new price will appear tomorrow, the Treasury Secretary declined to comment, but stated that the Treasury Department is doing its best to act according to the orders of Congress. China today reiterated to the State Department that it is deeply concerned about the soaring silver prices. (Guomin dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Manic Atmosphere in U.S. Silver Market</p>
<p>The silver market today presented a manic atmosphere rarely seen. Silver bloc members in Congress generally believe that the Treasury Department's silver purchase price will increase again in a few days. With the United States determined to continue purchasing silver until the price reaches $1.29, it remains questionable whether the Treasury Department can purchase a large quantity of silver on the world market. This is because speculators holding silver are greedy for huge profits and may not be willing to release it for the time being. They will probably be willing to sell only when the price is close to $1.29. If the movement to re-establish silver prices according to the same ratio as gold is to be prevented from taking effect, and the statutory silver price is not increased to $2.18, then the Treasury Department will inevitably absorb sufficient silver in order to maintain the current price of $0.7757. Senator Wheeler stated that the silver price is now only trending toward $1.29. What he wants to see is a fixed price ratio between silver and gold. He will continue to fight for the establishment of silver coinage at a ratio of 16 to 1 of gold and silver. In other words, based on the current price of gold at $35 per ounce, the price of silver would be $2.18 per ounce. Senator King stated that he wants to use silver to supplement gold, not to replace gold. The United States will be the first to adopt bimetallism, advocating it to all countries. (Reuters dispatch, 25th) Today, the New York silver price was officially set by Handy &amp; Harman at $0.77 per ounce. This is the highest price in more than a decade. However, it is rumored that there are bidders outside the market offering $0.7725. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Joy of Silver Bloc Members in Congress</p>
<p>(Washington) Observers here say that if the Treasury Department implements the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, it will still need to purchase more than 1 billion ounces of silver. Silver bloc members in Congress are very happy about the recent developments and predict that within a year, they will be able to restore silver as the American monetary standard at a ratio of 16 to 1 of gold and silver. Democratic Senator Wheeler even stated that there is currently a shortage of silver, and the silver price will definitely rise above $1.29. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Mexico Prepares to Reset Currency Value</p>
<p>(Washington) China is not the only country directly affected by the U.S. silver purchase policy. International experts here predict that Mexico may soon also protect its silver coins to prevent them from being melted down and sold as silver bars. These experts also say that if the silver price reaches above $0.72 per ounce, it will be profitable to melt them down, taking into account transportation and insurance costs. For Indian rupees, the silver price would have to reach $1 per ounce before melting becomes profitable. Former Mexican Foreign Minister, now Ambassador to Argentina, Casasús, said in New York that he expects the silver price to rise to $1 between June and July. However, he said that the current increase in silver prices by the United States could stimulate Mexico's prosperity. Based on the current silver price, the value of the silver content in Mexican silver coins is close to the face value of the coins, so the Mexican currency will soon have to be revalued. The Mexican Finance Minister has long been prepared for this. The value of the Mexican currency will probably also be increased to match the silver price. As for the argument that Mexico's foreign trade may suffer after the currency is revalued, Casasús does not believe it. (Guomin dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(New York) Financial figures here stated that the rise in silver prices is most beneficial to foreign speculators. Private holders of silver coins may melt the coins and sell the silver for profit. In addition, the Mexican government may follow China and protest the American silver policy. Recently, the Mexican government raised the value of the Mexican peso from 3.60 pesos to the dollar to 3.5925 pesos. If the silver price continues to rise, Mexico will raise the currency value again, which it fears may harm trade with the United States, and it is therefore quite hesitant. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>American Newspaper Criticizes Silver Policy</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Commercial writes today, criticizing the U.S. government's silver policy, saying that this farcical silver purchase program is now entering a more acute and harmful stage. It went on to mention the speculative fever in the world market caused by the Treasury Department's increase in silver prices, saying that unscrupulous elements have now launched a campaign to raise market prices to the target of $1.29. This silver program will have a great impact on the corruption of discipline in American political life. The silver bloc members, citing the interests of a very small number of silver mines, imposed such an absurd monetary plan on the government. This kind of power gives people a practical lesson and encourages others with special relationships to disregard the cost to their own country and other countries, and legally imitate it in order to seek the same treatment. The overseas impact of the silver program is even more noteworthy. China and Mexico will certainly feel great difficulties, and India will also be affected. If the silver price rises above $1.05 per ounce, Indian rupees will be privately destroyed. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Financial Times criticizes Roosevelt's policy of raising silver prices, saying that the American silver purchase policy seems to be a perverse means of politicians, causing China to fall into a serious monetary contraction crisis. The newspaper represents the views of the majority of British financiers. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London Silver Stocks Rise</p>
<p>(London) Silver mining stock prices here rose today. The Financial News stated that many silver mines produce minerals that are a mixture of silver, zinc, and lead. If silver production increases, the production of zinc and lead will also inevitably increase, which may lead to overproduction and lower prices. However, the rise in silver mining stock prices did not take this into account. Only when silver prices are permanently high can large profits be made. All London newspapers regard silver as important news. The comments of financial writers all believe that President Roosevelt's true intentions are still impossible to grasp. The speed of American silver purchases is also of particular concern. Some say that the United States already has a lot of gold reserves, and they want to accumulate silver. What kind of benefit is there? If it is intended to appease silver bloc members in Congress, there are other less costly methods. The Morning Post stated that China's efforts to prevent the outflow of silver have been partially successful, but as silver prices continue to rise, smuggling will become more rampant, and China may not be able to stop it. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Toronto: Canadian silver mining stocks rose sharply. Yesterday's trading volume reached 1,847,138 shares, the highest since August of last year. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Bombay: The Bombay silver market temporarily suspended new trading today, fearing that soaring silver prices would cause turmoil. Brokers are now focusing on clearing old transactions. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Japan Also Raises Silver Price</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Eiyo Association announced today a revised silver price of 83 yen, 87 sen, and 8 rin, an increase of 4 yen, 85 sen, and 5 rin, due to the soaring world silver prices. The daily selling price in the Tokyo silver market rose 1 sen and 8 rin from yesterday, totaling 3 sen and 2 rin and 8 rin. The buying price rose 1 sen, totaling 2 sen and 9 rin, reaching the highest price since the war. It is only a matter of time before it breaks through the selling price of 3 sen and 3 rin in January of the ninth year of the Taisho era (1920). (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>

(2) As a result of shifting the political focus to the Cabinet Deliberation Council, is the Cabinet not a simple implementation agency?

Another aircraft, apparently from Saarbrücken, flew over the Wallerfangen defensive works. Such things have been seen frequently recently. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany will quickly complete its plan to conscript 600,000 people, as its response to the League of Nations' condemnation. This point was expressed by official sources today, and Hitler is prepared to announce the defense law he had foreshadowed on March 16, implementing conscription. Germany's protest sent to the League of Nations is worded peacefully, but some leaders still advocate a stern response. If it is not issued in a government declaration, it should be reflected in practice. Therefore, the new national defense will probably be Germany's response. It is learned that the first level of conscription will report on October 1. The remaining levels will also be rapidly gathered until the number of armed personnel reaches more than 500,000. All the countries attending the League of Nations Executive Council have received Germany's brief protest and have been notified of Germany's statement of receipt. People generally expect that when Hitler announces the new national defense law, he will also reaffirm to the world that Germany is seeking peace. The German government is also prepared to participate in any conference to maintain European peace, as long as Germany's position is absolutely equal to that of other countries. It is learned that Britain and Germany have resumed the pre-war practice of exchanging army officers to study each other's military plans and strategies. The two countries have each sent one infantry, cavalry, and artillery officer to receive six weeks of training. According to unofficial sources, Germany also made the same proposal to Japan, saying that if Japan agrees, it may be possible to exchange more officers, and the study period may also be longer. Paris is not surprised by the accelerated progress of German armaments. French officials said that they had anticipated this, so France is also proceeding with its original plan to encircle Germany. The French-Russian military agreement has already been agreed upon by both parties and can be signed next week. It is also learned that Foreign Minister Laval is scheduled to go to Moscow on May 6 to complete the final procedures of the agreement and discuss the proposed Russian-Czech agreement with Russian officials.

<p>(London) Regarding Germany's reorganization of its air force, the Daily Express recently disclosed startling news, saying, "The first-line aircraft possessed by Germany to defend its mainland is more than twice that of Britain. When British and German cabinet members were talking in Berlin, German leader Hitler told British Foreign Secretary Simon that the German air force has reached an equal position with Britain. The so-called equality does not refer to the 400 aircraft possessed by Britain in the mainland, but includes the 1,020 first-line aircraft possessed by the British Royal Air Force in the entire empire." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(New York) Simms, an American expert on foreign affairs, recently disclosed in an article in the World News, saying that although the left bank of the Rhine River is prohibited from installing armaments by the Treaty of Versailles, Germany is still actively fortifying the area and storing a large number of military supplies there. The Rhineland National Socialist Army has secretly been reorganized into regular troops. Between the Rhine River and the Meuse River, there are several battalions of engineers who use the excuse of dredging the river, but in fact, they are building large-scale defensive structures. From the city of Cologne to the Swiss border, concrete and steel cellars and heavy artillery mounting sites are being built everywhere. The police stationed on the left bank of the Rhine River number 60,000, who can be immediately converted into troops. In addition, there are 36,000 elite soldiers who are temporarily training in camps. Military figures claim that once the soldiers training in the camps in the Rhineland are formed into formal divisions, Hitler can immediately declare this fait accompli. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Germany States That it Still Wishes to Continue Negotiations, Takes a Cautious Attitude Towards MacDonald's Remarks <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are generally taking a cautious attitude towards British Prime Minister MacDonald's advice to Germany. It is believed that all newspapers are awaiting instructions from the authorities before offering criticism. Diplomatic circles believe that "Germany has temporarily suspended its thinking." Judging from the tone of the newspapers and government spokespersons, Germany does not want to close the door to negotiations. Many of Hitler's advisors value maintaining friendly relations with Britain. Since British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Berlin, Germany has been paying attention to the Soviet Union's welcome of British Lord Privy Seal Eden, the united front taken by Britain, France, and Italy at the Stresa Conference, and the actions of its major ally Poland in voting against Germany in Geneva. It is widely believed that Germany has now suspended considering the impact of its policies on neighboring countries. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After British Prime Minister MacDonald published an article in the National Labour Party's official newspaper, the *News Communication Magazine*, criticizing Germany, all newspapers here, because of the unusual qualifications of the author, expressed surprise on the one hand and satisfaction on the other, seeing in it the clarity of the British national character. *Le Figaro* stated that MacDonald, as the head of government and usually treating Germany with sincerity, has now issued such a discussion, then the great mistakes made by the German authorities can be estimated. Furthermore, the attitude that Germany can express towards the Stresa Conference and the League of Nations Administrative Council is purely artificial and lacks sincerity, which has been revealed by MacDonald's words. "MacDonald then warned Germany that Britain's position is consistent with that of France and Italy, which in Britain is a conscious and carefully considered one." *L'Ordre* said, "Although this belief of Prime Minister MacDonald is not something that can be established overnight, since such a belief has arisen, he does not hesitate to express it clearly, which will shock the British people, and most Britons will wait and see what the German authorities do, so as not to be deceived." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister MacDonald published an article in the National Labour Party's official newspaper, the *News Communication Magazine*, criticizing Germany, the Liberal Party and Labour Party opposition newspapers expressed dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister's arguments, hoping that Germany could eventually join the collective security system. The *Daily Herald* stated that the Prime Minister's article was harmful and unhelpful, and it was a pity that it could cause debate outside the League of Nations. The *News Chronicle* stated that it was inappropriate for the Prime Minister to formally express his views at this critical juncture in the peace negotiations. *The Times* reported on MacDonald's article without commenting on it. The Conservative Party's *Daily Telegraph* stated that the Prime Minister's open and honest move was to be congratulated. This kind of argument, coming from the mouth of a British Prime Minister who is deeply fond of peace, is sufficient to represent the true psychology of the governments of European countries. From a comparison of the air force strength of Britain and Germany, we know that the Prime Minister's words are not wrong. (Havas, 26th)</p>

It is said that the participants asked the former King to restore the monarchy, and the former King has agreed. Today, the *London Evening Standard* published an article by the former King of Greece, George, firmly denying the above news, saying that he absolutely knew nothing about it, had never attended any meeting, and that no one had advised him to return to the country to restore the monarchy. It is noted that former King George ascended the throne in January 1923, was forced to leave the country in December of the same year, and four months later, the Greek Republic was proclaimed.

<p>(Berlin) In the future, German newspapers can only be published by individuals, groups, or organizations permitted by Amann, the de facto dictator of German publications and master of information for the National Socialist Party. This was stipulated in the new law announced tonight. The most important provision is to prohibit joint-stock companies, public organizations, professional groups, cooperative groups, and similar organizations or non-Aryans from publishing newspapers. It also stipulates that publishers must clarify that all those who have financial relationships with the newspaper and their spouses are of Aryan descent, and must go back to the year 1800. There is a six-month grace period to comply with the law. It is widely believed that several of the oldest non-partisan newspapers and Catholic newspapers, if they do not receive approval for leniency, will not be able to survive. Amann has the inherent right to issue this. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Interior Minister Frick has recently issued an order that, in the future, the party flag and the national flag of Germany should prioritize the party flag. Although government offices and public buildings will continue to display the party and national flags side by side, when there is only a single flagpole in the center of the building, it should be used exclusively to hang the swastika party flag, and the black, white, and red national emblem should be hung in the center window. If there are two flagpoles side by side on the roof of the building, the swastika party flag should be hung to the right of the tricolor national flag. If there are three flagpoles, the tricolor national flag should be hung in the center, and the swastika party flags should be hung on both sides. The order also stated that this is a temporary measure, as the form of the national flag has not yet been decided and is being selected. (Guomin News Agency, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e78">British-Russian Negotiations and the European Situation <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— (European Correspondence)</p>
<p>Britain Temporarily Abandons Anti-Russian Policy; German-French Conflict May Thus Be Eased</p>
<p>After participating in the British-German negotiations in Berlin, the British Lord Privy Seal Eden then went to Moscow according to his scheduled itinerary. This is a large whale from the sea running to Eastern Europe to meet the giant bear on land, and it is happening at a time when the international situation is particularly urgent. Its significance is not only related to the future peace or war in Europe, but also whether the world can maintain the status quo depends on whether there is a possibility of compromise between the two sides in this negotiation.</p>
<p>The opposition between Britain and Russia has made international politics more complicated in recent years. For example, if Japan had forcibly seized the four eastern provinces of our country without Britain's tacit consent, then things would not have been so simple. If Germany had rearmed without Britain's secret protection, Hitler would not have dared to use such strong tactics. Naturally, Britain does not love Japan and Germany. Its consistent policy is nothing more than to plan to create an anti-Russian front. Therefore, after the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, the Japanese used the slogan of attacking Soviet Russia to fundamentally soften British public opinion. The Eastern Locarno Treaty was also forced to a dead end for French diplomats because Britain was unwilling to abandon its anti-Russian policy, allowing Germany to secretly expand its armaments at ease. Before the British-Russian negotiations were held, French newspapers were always worried that the incompatibility between Britain and Russia would make French diplomacy more difficult. In order to deal with Germany, France needs powerful military allies. In future wars, France cannot lack the land and air forces of Soviet Russia, and it also needs the help of the British navy. However, it is impossible to have both. France must choose one country, either allying with Britain or allying with Russia. Therefore, Laval felt it was difficult to please both sides. The difficulty in resolving the German-French issue in recent years is also due to the conflict between Britain and Russia.</p>
<p>Simon's visit to Berlin beforehand Germany held great hopes. Hitler had used the bold character of his Germanic soldiers and his special talent for speech, originally wanting to persuade Simon with the danger of communism and find a way out for Germany in the contradictions between Britain and Russia. However, it is simply wishful thinking to make a cold-blooded Englishman move emotionally and forget the interests of the British Empire. This is especially true of Foreign Minister Simon, who is proficient in law. People originally said that he was a "cold within cold" Englishman. This time, Hitler used German-style diplomacy and happened to meet him, so naturally it was not easy to gain any advantage.</p>
<p>In fact, although Britain's recent diplomatic route has aimed at opposing Russia, it has become clear since it was once greatly fooled by the Japanese that there are always better players. Others are not necessarily more stupid than the British, and they seem to be more careful than before. Because of its geographical distance from Soviet Russia and its historical feud with France, and although the National Socialist ideology conflicts with Soviet Russia, it is still questionable whether Germany can serve as the vanguard against Russia militarily. Britain sees this very clearly. What Simon wanted to understand in the British-German negotiations was not only to be satisfied with Germany's determination to oppose Russia, but also to see, first, whether an anti-Russian war could be realized, and second, whether Germany had other ambitions. Then he would decide on Britain's final attitude towards Germany. Hitler's answers to Simon on these two points still seemed to be a vague attitude. He treated the anti-Russian issue as the main subject of this negotiation, which was correct in principle, but he did not have any further proposals. This easily makes Britain feel that Germany is only using opposition to Soviet Russia as a slogan to coerce, and is actually pursuing other goals. For example, Hitler explained that Germany's rearmament was entirely due to defense against Russia. He vividly depicted Soviet Russia's plan to communize Europe and placed the responsibility of protecting culture on himself. This is Hitler's understanding of the British. In Simon's eyes, isn't National Socialist Germany and Communist Soviet Russia essentially the same? Everyone is a troublemaker. The most important thing is as long as it doesn't harm Britain's interests. Hitler believes that in addition to possessing millions of land troops, Soviet Russia also has the world's strongest air force. Moreover, when war breaks out, the major cities in eastern Germany are in danger of being bombed by the Soviet Russian air force. Therefore, Britain should sympathize with Germany's expansion of armaments. As for Germany's refusal to sign the Eastern Locarno Treaty, it is also for the same reason. Hitler believes that Germany and Soviet Russia have long had an irreconcilable attitude. If Germany joins a certain Eastern European security treaty, then once a certain anti-Soviet Russian country attacks Soviet Russia, it is simply impossible for Germany to send troops to help Soviet Russia. Similarly, when Germany is attacked by others, it cannot tolerate the Red Army entering German territory. In short, in order to ensure the security of Europe, Germany needs to be equal to Soviet Russia in terms of land and air forces. As for the navy, Germany demands at least equality with France, the purpose of which is said to be still to defend against Russia.</p>
<p>This time, Hitler may have misjudged the British. Although Britain hopes that Germany will be willing to be the vanguard against Russia, if it can really be realized, Britain may be willing to make more concessions. However, Hitler's chest-beating attitude has the aura of the Japanese. The matter has not yet been done, but he first wants a lot of benefits. This is what the British are unwilling to be fooled again. On the other hand, the monster of Germany is not only afraid of France, but also constantly wary of Britain. When Simon arrived in Berlin, it was just after Germany announced an increase in its military, and the whole country was in a state of war. In addition, Hitler himself personally told Simon that Germany's air force strength has caught up with Britain. Hitler's original intention may have been only to ingratiate himself with Britain, indicating that his strength is sufficient to serve as the vanguard against Russia. But in Simon's ears, the meaning is very different. Britain is afraid that Soviet Russia cannot be eliminated, and instead another Germany will emerge out of thin air, which is not good for the British Empire. As a result of the Berlin talks, because of the haggling between the two sides and their different goals, Britain and Germany were unable to reach a consensus on the point of anti-Russia. At this point, British politicians played their old tricks again, taking a step back and waiting for changes.</p>
<p>Just at this time, Eden ran to Moscow. The significance of these British-Russian negotiations for Soviet Russia is needless to say. Even Stalin - the uncrowned king of Soviet Russia today - never received foreign diplomats except for exchanges with the US ambassador to Russia. But this time was an exception. He met Eden. He asked whether Britain was allowing Germany to act freely in Eastern Europe. This is a very interesting contrast. The object of the talks in Moscow was Germany. Some people say that the only achievement of the British diplomat's visit to Germany and Russia this time is to make Germany and Russia openly curse each other. As for the entire European situation, it is still the same as before. What has changed may only be that Britain has temporarily abandoned its attempt to attack Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>If an anti-Russian war cannot be realized for a while, then there is a common ground between Britain and Russia: the hope for peace and the hope to find ways to maintain the status quo. This is especially true after Simon's visit to Berlin. On the one hand, Britain has understood Germany's true face, and on the other hand, the European situation does not allow Britain to have such a risky plan again. Therefore, British-Russian relations have taken a sharp turn for the worse.</p>
<p>The most important point of the Moscow talks this time is how to maintain peace in Europe. Soviet Russia's proposal is still to conclude an Eastern Locarno Treaty. Due to the provisions of this treaty, the eastern border of Soviet Russia is guaranteed by the strength of France and Czechoslovakia, and naturally it is no longer afraid of the actions of Germany and Poland. And Britain hopes for peace in Europe under the leadership of the League of Nations. After everyone's concessions, they accepted each other's proposals in principle. This means that Britain supports the signing of the Eastern Locarno Treaty, and Soviet Russia must also do its best to help the group convention under the leadership of Britain. What is the group convention? In other words, this is a variation of Britain's long-standing policy in Europe: maintaining the balance of power between countries. If this group convention is realized, then a balance of power will be created among the four European powers, France, Russia, Germany, and Italy. At that time, Britain's actions can influence the overall situation. We must not misunderstand London politicians and think that they will join the anti-German group after the failure of the British-German negotiations and force Hitler to surrender. On the contrary, Germany's resurgence will only make Britain's diplomacy more convenient. Therefore, in the future, whether Britain compromises with France and Russia or not, its long-standing pro-German attitude will probably not fundamentally change.</p>
<p>Britain's temporary abandonment of its anti-Russian policy seems to be purely for peace on the surface. London gentlemen are not only acting as mediators between Germany and Russia in Europe, but are even willing to consider the disputes between Japan and Russia in the Far East. For this "friendly" move by Britain, Soviet Russia must pay a material price. The most important condition for this exchange is that Soviet Russia must stop its communist propaganda in the British mainland and its territories. Only in this way will British politicians believe in Litvinov's theory of coexistence between socialist and capitalist countries. However, this condition is still not enough.</p>
<p>British trade with Russia in 1934 almost quadrupled compared to 1933, and the total value of exports to Russia in January of this year was £706,408, compared to only £548,482 in January of last year. In addition, Soviet Russia has announced to Britain that the cash that Russia used to transport to the United States every year will now be changed to London. In this way, Soviet Russia's orders in Britain will greatly increase. According to the opinions of Soviet Russian diplomats in Britain, if it is implemented according to the planned plan, the number of unemployed people in Britain can be reduced by 250,000 within three months. At a time when countries are suffering from unemployment problems, reducing 250,000 people is a huge temptation for Britain. Perhaps the economy is still the most important reason why Britain and Russia are moving towards compromise this time. Soviet Russia is good at using the weapon of foreign trade, and so British gentlemen also feel that they have to change their original attitude. This time, Moscow and Berlin are mutually pulling Britain, and because everyone's positions are different, their attitudes are also different. On the one hand, Germany is limited by the military character of the Germanic nation and cannot pretend to be "seemingly peaceful." On the other hand, Germany also needs to show some strength in order to gain Britain's trust and make the establishment of an anti-Russian front possible. Therefore, Germany can achieve its desired goals. So when Simon arrived in Berlin, Hitler sent his personal guards fully armed to the airfield to greet him. Soviet Russia is not like that. What Eden saw in Moscow this time was almost entirely about cultural construction, such as libraries, museums, dance in theaters, and the newly completed underground railway in Moscow. Even the Red Army club, which used to practice almost every day in the sky over the western suburbs of Moscow, did not see a single aircraft during the period when the British guests were in Moscow. Soviet Russia wanted to tell Britain that it only focuses on its domestic construction and has no intention of invading others. Originally, in international politics, everyone takes their own interests as the premise, so naturally there is no love or hate. The way Germany and Russia treat Simon and Eden is only a matter of form, and of course it will not affect Britain's fundamental attitude. But we must remember that Britain is still a country that is trying its best to avoid war, so this attitude of Soviet Russia will also have some effect on Britain.</p>
<p>We only need to compare the joint announcements of Britain and Germany and Britain and Russia to understand that Britain's attitude has been shaken. It is of course difficult to predict how the entire future European situation will change, but if the opposition between Britain and Russia is really eliminated, then Germany and France may be able to avoid a war. However, at this moment, it is not easy to rein in at the precipice. (April 3rd in Berlin)</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Ya of This Newspaper</p>
<p>The Thriving City of Xijing</p>
<p>Shaanxi was the ancient land of Yongzhou. The provincial capital is the old city of Xi'an Prefecture. The Zhou, Qin, Han, Western Wei, Northern Zhou, Sui, and Tang dynasties all established their capitals here or nearby. The Xi'an Prefecture governed Xianning and Chang'an counties. In the Republic of China, the prefectures and counties were abolished, and Xianning and Chang'an were merged, collectively known as Chang'an County. In the early Zhou Dynasty, the capital was Haojing, more than twenty li southwest of present-day Xi'an. When the capital was moved to Luoyang, Haojing was abandoned. Qin destroyed the six kingdoms and established its capital in Xianyang. Xianyang Palace was abandoned, and Epang Palace was built. Xiang Yu entered the pass and burned Epang Palace, and the Weiyang Palace of the Han Dynasty was completed. The Sui Dynasty built a new capital in present-day Chang'an, which was expanded in the early Tang Dynasty. The city was about eighteen li from east to west and fifteen li from north to south, with a circumference of sixty-seven li. Later, it was reduced in size again. In the early years of the Ming Dynasty, the old city of the Tang Dynasty was rebuilt. The Qing Dynasty followed suit, with only repairs. In the Republic of China, its old appearance was retained, and it was still named Xi'an. In the twenty-first year, the central government designated Luoyang as the acting capital and Xi'an as the auxiliary capital. The capital was Nanjing, and the acting capital was Tokyo, so Xi'an was known as Xijing, which originated in the Zhou Dynasty. It is also said that Xijing was the old name of the Han and Tang dynasties. The might of Emperor Wu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang shook the surrounding barbarians, which was the most glorious era of our Chinese nation. Now, renaming it Xijing is intended to learn from the past and encourage the future.</p>
<p>Today's Xi'an city is about seven li long from east to west and five li wide from north to south, with a circumference of nearly thirty li. The popular saying that it is ten li long and wide, with a circumference of forty li, is not true. The city wall is thirty-four feet high and three zhang thick at the top. The old gates were four: the east gate was called Changle, the west gate was called Anding, the south gate was called Yongning, and the north gate was called Anyuan. The east and west gates are slightly biased towards the south of the city, so the northern half of the city is larger than the southern half. When Feng Yuxiang's army was stationed in Shaanxi, two new gates were built in the northeast corner: the east-facing one was called Zhongshan Gate, and the north-facing one was called Zhongzheng Gate (formerly Yuxiang Gate, with the railway station outside). The old four gates each had a moat, a gate tower, and an arrow tower on the moat, reaching a height of ten zhang. Its grandeur can be compared with the city towers of Beiping. However, during the eight-and-a-half-month siege of the city by Liu Zhenhua in the fifteenth year, Yang Hucheng resisted and destroyed the wooden planks inside, which is a pity.</p>
<p>According to a survey in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the population of Xijing city was 120,000. After the siege of the fifteenth year and the great drought of the seventeenth and eighteenth years, many people died, were injured, or fled. According to a survey in June of the twentieth year, there were only 108,000 people. Afterwards, it gradually increased year by year. According to the Construction Department, there were 114,389 people at the end of the twenty-first year, 121,583 people at the end of the twenty-second year, and 125,141 people at the end of last year. According to local people, the household registration of the urban area, if accurately investigated, should be at least 150,000 people or more. This spring, with the railway open, the population will increase sharply.</p>
<p>The commerce of Xijing city has shown a prosperous trend in recent years due to the increase in government agencies and the development of transportation. Areas such as Zhongshan Street (East Street), Zhubashi, and Minzhong Street (South Courtyard Gate) are all shops selling department stores, fine satin, leather goods, and paper. There are many new-style decorations. Hotels and restaurants, such as the Xijing Hotel and Northwest Hotel on Zhongshan Street, have rare architectural facilities in the Northwest. The streets are also very wide, with separate lanes for pedestrians and vehicles, which can avoid congestion. Newly planted pagoda trees and willows on both sides have greatly increased the beauty of the city. Qiaozikou on West Street has many grocery stores. Only the western half of North Street has many shops, while the eastern half does not. The area near the city is still all wasteland, showing a rather deformed development. South Street has mountain goods stores and jewelry shops. Other products from various places in southern Shaanxi, such as lacquer, hemp, and tung oil, are first sold in Nanguan. Transportation tools include cars, rickshaws, bicycles, horse-drawn carriages, large carts, and wheelbarrows. East and West Fire Streets, and from Zhongshan Gate to South Street, have started operating public buses this spring. The responsible authorities are gradually building macadam roads on various streets, but due to various reasons such as surveying levels, little attention has been paid to drainage ditches, so rainwater cannot be discharged, and sometimes it is very muddy. Various towns such as Caotan, Doumen, Xinzhu, Yinjiahui, and Duqu are also prosperous commercial areas belonging to the county. Glutinous rice crops are sold to Henan and Shanxi, and pig bristles and sheep wool are transported to Tianjin and Shanghai. The export of cotton has also increased year by year. Those transported in from outside are Hankou tea, Shanxi salt, Jiangzhe silk satin, Hubei copperware, and wheat flour from Bengbu and other places. The geology of Chang'an is loess, which is most suitable for agriculture. The Wei, Ba, Chan, Xiao, Feng, Zao, Jue, and Lao rivers all provide irrigation benefits. Secondly, well irrigation is used. Rich families use waterwheels, while poor people use manual labor to draw water, all of which can achieve their goals. Therefore, rice and hemp are grown in the fields, and every family has enough to eat. The terrain of the whole county is a rhomboid basin, slightly higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest. The areas of Xianyang and Sanyuan have become plateaus, and the west is surrounded by the Longban slopes, while the southeast is surrounded by the Qinling Mountains. Such fertile land and abundant rivers, with mountains and rivers as barriers, have been the reasons for choosing capitals here throughout the ages. The climate is hottest in summer, with temperatures reaching 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In winter, it drops to freezing point. Spring and autumn are in the 70s and 80s. Autumn is rainy, with overcast skies for ten days, almost like the plum rains in Jiangnan. Spring needs rain the most, but rainfall is lacking, hence the saying "spring rain is as precious as oil." If there is an east wind in spring and a west wind after autumn, it can bring rain. There is also the saying "Chang'an has always had west wind and rain." There is snow in winter and early spring. When the north wind arrives, everything is frozen solid, and water drips into ice. Well water is very scarce. Only the Sweet Water Well near the West Gate in the city, the Saintly Woman Spring in the northwest suburbs of the city, and the Double Dragon Pool west of the Niutou Temple in the south of the city are the three famous springs of Chang'an. Shaanxi Province is the birthplace of ancient Chinese culture, and Chang'an was the capital of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties. There are too many famous scenic spots and historical sites to see: (1) The Chang'an Mountains, branched from the Qinling Mountains, form peaks everywhere, with different names in different places, such as Qinghua Mountain, Guanyin Mountain, Xiaowutai, and Cuihua Mountain, but Nanwutai is the most secluded and beautiful. The car road is open, and many contemporary talents visit it. (2) The First Provincial Library is where Zhang Zai, Cheng Yi, and Cheng Hao lectured in the cave dwellings. It has been rebuilt. In addition to books, it also houses the Zhou Ding, Qin and Han ancient artifacts, the Tang Bell, and the Zhaoling stone carvings of horses. (Note: These stones were carved when Emperor Taizong of Tang buried Empress Wende. Originally there were six horses, but in the fifth year of the Republic of China, they were stolen and sold to foreigners by powerful people, smashed and driven away. The people of Shaanxi recovered four of them.) and other antiques, more than two hundred and seventy pieces large and small. (3) The Stele Forest is located in the Dongfu School in the South Gate, which is the old site of the Tang Imperial College. Many steles of various calligraphers such as Yan, Liu, Chu, and Ou are stored inside, hence the name Stele Forest. There are a total of 472 kinds of steles, with more than 2,400 stones of various sizes. (4) The Bell Tower was built in the west corner of the city in the seventeenth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty. In the tenth year of Wanli, it was moved to the center of the city. It has three floors and is more than ten zhang high. It used to house an astronomical museum and a public lecture hall. Now it is stationed by the army. The Drum Tower in front of the southeast provincial government has nine bays and four floors, about eighty-six feet high. Walking up the eaves steps, it is sixty-eight steps long from east to west and thirty-eight steps wide from north to south. Climbing high and looking out, the whole city is in sight, giving a sense of "a dangerous building is a thousand feet high, and you can pick the stars and clouds by hand." (5) The Big Wild Goose Pagoda is in the Ci'en Temple eight li southeast of the city. It has seven floors. The base of the pagoda is fourteen zhang on each side and about eighteen zhang high. There is a spiral staircase to climb to the top. There are many steles with inscriptions from past dynasties in front of it, which is what is called the inscription of the Wild Goose Pagoda. (6) Jianfu Temple was the old residence of Emperor Yang of Sui when he lived in the vassal state. Later, it was donated as a temple. There is a tall pagoda in it, with fifteen floors, facing the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, so it is called the Small Wild Goose Pagoda. During the earthquake in the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, the pagoda split into two. Later, another earthquake slightly reunited the crack, about a foot wide, forming a straight line from top to bottom, which is truly a spectacle. (7) Yangta Temple is said to be the Sui Baoqing Temple or built by the sisters of Yang Guifei in the Tang Dynasty. (8) The Temple of Literature has magnificent halls and towering ancient cypresses, built since the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty. (9) Lotus Lake Park, Songjia Garden, Qingzhen Temple Niutou Temple, Du Fu Temple, Dong Zhongshu Temple, Qujiang Pool, and other places are all scenic spots for sightseeing. The Xijing Preparatory Committee and the Xijing Municipal Construction Committee are not only planning and building the city, but also striving to preserve historical sites, seeking to restore the beauty of Zhongnan and Shanglin, and tracing the prosperity of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties, which is not only for attracting tourists and prospering the market.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Cai Tingkai Returns to China; To Recuperate in Hong Kong for a Short Period; The Trip to Guilin Province is Not True <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Cai Tingkai, the former commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army, arrived in Hong Kong on the Coolidge wheel via the Philippines at six o'clock in the morning on the 19th of this month. Comrades and old subordinates who welcomed him at the Hong Kong pier beforehand included Chen Mingshu, Shen Guanghan, Tan Qixiu, Qiu Zhaochen, Deng Shizeng, Weng Guiqing, Ye Shaoquan, and Cai's younger brother Chao Kai, and others, more than ten people in all. Although Mr. Cai showed a slightly weary look when he disembarked, he was in better spirits than before. After shaking hands and exchanging greetings with those who welcomed him, he returned to his private residence on Shancun Road, Happy Valley. According to Mr. Cai's remarks to visitors, he left for overseas on April 11th last year and arrived in Italy on May 5th. He then successively inspected various countries in mainland Europe, and then went to England. Due to the urgency of the question of time in all the places he went, he just took a cursory look, and failed to conduct a deep investigation. From the surface observation, various European countries are now implementing control over the economy, and there is a phenomenon of the rise of heavy industry. The military preparations of various countries are all being greatly improved and expanded. At present, Germany is the center of the European issue. Since the signing of a secret agreement between Japan, Germany, and Poland, Japan has used Germany to contain the European powers in order to fulfill its ambition to develop arbitrarily in East Asia. Italy has recently been striving to rectify its military preparations. The fascist organization is tightly knit, and the rulers are truly able to be selfless and sincere for the country. The German people are disciplined and orderly, France has a bright culture, and the people love the country. The people of Belgium and Switzerland work hard in industry and fully demonstrate the spirit of autonomy. British society is stable and the people abide by the law. All of these can be models for our country from top to bottom. The United States has recently experienced overproduction and a sharp increase in unemployment, and its finances still need to be reorganized. Overseas Chinese in our country suffer all kinds of unequal treatment and are greatly affected by the recession, experiencing great pain. The present return to the country will be to rest in Hong Kong, and it is not intended to go elsewhere in the short term. The rumors that I am going to Guilin Province are not true. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Jiangxi Province: The Tragic Decline of the Timber Industry; Exports Drop from Over Eight Million to Just Over One Million <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Jiangxi Province has a mild climate and fertile land, which is very suitable for the reproduction of forests. In particular, cedar and camphor wood are the most abundant and famous products. Cedar wood is everywhere, and there is a lack of statistics on production. What can be used as a reference is the tax levied by the tax bureau. According to the survey and statistics on timber specialties conducted by the Jiangxi Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the old Ganzhou Prefecture produced 5 to 6 million branches annually, the counties near Ji'an produced about 6 to 7 million branches, Jianchang produced about 2 million branches, Fuzhou produced about 1 million branches, Xiushui River basin produced about 2 million branches, Fuliang produced more than 100,000 branches, and Wuyuan Dexing produced more than 100,000 branches, Guangfeng and other counties produced more than 200,000 branches, totaling 16 to 17 million branches. According to the calculation of two codes at the same time, the annual output is more than 350,000 taels of two codes, with a total value of more than 5.83 million yuan. This kind of number is just an estimate, but analyzing the timber sold in Changzhou for 10 million yuan, the annual value of Jiangxi Province is about 7 million yuan to 8 million yuan. In the past, the timber produced in Jiangxi Province was collected in Wucheng by the Gan River, Fu River, and Xiu River, and transported to Nanjing and the Yangtze River area. In society, timber merchants and salt merchants were known side by side as great merchants. However, in recent years, the situation has been very different. The number of sales has plummeted. Most timber merchants have no foothold. The tax bills issued by the Jiangxi Production and Sales Tax Bureau from June 21st to May 22nd of the Republic of China, in one year, the timber transported out of the province was 1,400,000,1609 branches, and the average value was calculated at one yuan, for a total of 1.4 million yuan, which is only one-eighth of the peak period. The tragedy of the decline is truly alarming. The biggest reasons are: (1) Natural disasters and man-made disasters, important production areas have fallen into the hands of bandits for eight years, production has been cut off, and goods have been abandoned on the ground, even if there are a few, they cannot be transported out. (2) Foreign loans and foreign timber are selling well. The import of foreign timber has increased more than ten times in twenty years. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the value of timber imports reached 3,168,4806 yuan. (3) Adhering to the old methods and not knowing how to add artificial sawing and planing to compete with foreign pine that saves labor and materials will eventually lead to failure. (April 22nd)</p>

<p>Qian Shiyi, a football star from Shanghai Nanguang, was 26 years old and a native of Ganlu Town in this county. A few days ago, Qian returned to Wuxi from Shanghai at the invitation of his friend Yang Fuyuan to watch the incense gathering at Furong Mountain in the northern countryside. Yesterday, Qian and three or four friends rowed a small boat from the mountain village to the city, leisurely wandering in the heart of the river, advancing slowly. At about 2 p.m., when sailing near Changxin Bridge on Guangqin Road, a Xiangyu steamboat suddenly came from behind at full speed, surging waves, and the momentum was very strong. The small boat Qian and others were driving was agitated by the huge waves, causing it to capsize. Qian and the other four people fell into the river at the same time. The river surface was wide and Qian, who did not know how to swim, was tragically submerged. The other three people swam to the shore and climbed up. They reported to the map head Tang Rengen, who reported to the court for an autopsy. The Xiangyu steamboat that caused the accident had already escaped.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Beijing-Wuxi-Wujin Silk Industry Joint Petition <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>During the Qing Guangxu period (16th and 17th years), silk and satin merchants in Wuxi, together with colleagues in Nanjing, Wujin, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hankou, organized the Jiangsu-Yu-Ning Guild Halls in Hangzhou to provide accommodation for the industry and to directly handle goods with silk weaving households. At that time, it was presented to the Zhejiang Governor and the county government for approval and filing. It has been more than 30 years. Recently, the silk industry has declined. The merchants in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hankou, and other places no longer go directly to Hangzhou to handle goods. Only the merchants in Beijing, Wujin and Wuxi still go to Hangzhou to purchase goods directly from the weaving households in the guild hall. However, last year, the Hangzhou Municipal Silk Industry Market planned to formulate methods for registering and receiving goods on behalf of customers in the guild hall. All those who previously purchased goods from the weaving households in the guild hall must enter the market. After registration, they must pay a deposit of 500 yuan, and also pay market service fees and equipment fees. The payment for the goods received must also be handed over to the market, and the weaving households will be given a long-term check separately. It has been approved and announced by Zhou Xiangxian, the mayor of Hangzhou. The silk industry in Beijing and Wuxi believes that business is absolutely free according to law. The silk industry market should not be restricted suddenly. Moreover, the industry has always paid in cash for goods, but now it is suddenly changed to promissory notes, which is obviously exploiting the weaving households, and the layer-by-layer extraction is even worse than the exchange. In addition to separately sending letters to the chambers of commerce in various places requesting the Hangzhou Municipal Government to revoke the registration and receipt methods, the colleagues in Nanjing and Wujin also elected representatives Jin Huanwen and others to come to Wuxi and unite with the colleagues in Wuxi to hold a meeting in the Wuxi Silk and Cloth Industry Guild Hall to agree that the colleagues in Beijing, Wuxi, and Wujin will immediately petition the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan to cancel the methods in order to benefit the merchants.</p>

He immediately led the team in disguise to arrest him. After detailed interrogation by the team, he confessed without denial. He was then sent to the county government for interrogation. After repeated summons to the victims to verify the evidence, he was sentenced to death. He was presented to the provincial government for review. Yesterday (25th), he was ordered to be executed by shooting. County magistrate Hou sent a team to sign and bring the prisoner to the case, verified his identity, and tied him to the Fenweidun execution ground for execution by shooting at 3 p.m.</p>

<p>In Yaojiaqiao, the fifth district of Dongxiang County, there is a resident named Zhao Yunlong, 34 years old, who works as a partner in a certain iron shop in the town. Last year, he borrowed ten yuan from his colleague Nie Changde, but he could not get it back after repeated requests. The other day, he went to Nie to recover the debt. They disagreed and started fighting each other. Both of them were holding iron hammers, and they fought fiercely for a long time. Unexpectedly, Zhao accidentally hit Nie's head with a hammer, and his brain was splashed out. He immediately fell to the ground and died. When the neighbors saw the murder, they arrested Zhao and sent him to the Fifth District Office, and then transferred him to the court for nailing and custody.</p>

<p>In Yujia Village, the fourth district of Qidong, there is a widow named Zhu, whose husband died many years ago. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, she cohabited with Kai Dao, the younger brother of Pan Kaiqu, a giant bandit in Jiangbei. In the nineteenth year, Bandit Pan was executed, and Kai Dao escaped without a trace. All the silver dollars and valuables obtained by robbery were collected by Widow Zhu on his behalf, a considerable amount. Recently, bandits learned of this and went to rob her in groups at about 9 p.m. the day before yesterday. After entering the room, they first twisted and beat Zhu fiercely, forcing her to hand over the hidden silver. Zhu had no choice but to hand over a small box under the bed, containing 310 silver dollars and many gold and silver jewelry ornaments. The bandits, believing that their purpose had been achieved, left with a howl. Yesterday, Zhou, the police inspector in charge of the local public security sub-station, learned of this, went to investigate, and reported to the county government for investigation.</p>

They discussed matters for about half an hour before leaving.</p>
<p>American Community Banquet At noon, all members of the mission attended a luncheon hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. The attendees were all prominent American expatriates in Shanghai, numbering about fifty. During the luncheon, the Vice-Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, Franklin, delivered a welcoming speech, stating that American expatriates in Shanghai should do their utmost to assist the mission during its stay in China and wished the mission success.

All members of the mission and their families attended, along with senior officials from the Shanghai Municipal Government, bureau chiefs, Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Song Ziliang, Gu Shaochuan, Yu Qiaqing, Ding Wenjiang, Zhao Tiezhang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, Zhang Xiaolin, Huang Jinrong, Lao Jingxiu, Wu Yunzhai, Wang Yunwu, Zhao Jinqing, Mu Ouchu, Li Fuxun, Xu Xinliu, Cao Yunxiang, Admiral Yabraham, Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Fleet, US Consul General Cunningham, US Assessor Harmill, US Marine Corps Commander Barman, US Consul Davis, US High-Level Counselor Arno, and consuls from various countries, were invited to attend, with reception committee members hosting. Over three hundred people attended. The Datong Music Society also attended to perform classical music to enhance the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech At the banquet, Chairman Zhang Jia'ao rose to speak, saying, "Tonight, various groups in this city related to international business and culture have jointly welcomed the American Economic Mission with a toast, hoping to strengthen the economic and business ties between the two major Pacific powers. On behalf of the various civil groups, I would like to express a few words to show our welcome. Aside from Mr. Dalai's small group visiting China in 1910, the United States has not had a large group of well-known figures from various fields, such as this mission. International trade relations rely on daily negotiations and the accumulation of goodwill. Since the commencement of trade between China and the United States, both sides have treated each other fairly and justly at all times and in all places, so there have been no political disputes, and Sino-American trade has continued to increase. Today, we have such a large delegation visiting our country, which can be seen as the culmination of decades of friendly relations. On the American side, they understand that the Chinese people crave peace and seek international economic development, and they wish to further shake hands with our people. On the Chinese side, we firmly believe that the American people's spirit of upholding fairness and justice remains consistent. We deeply desire an opportunity to express our deeper goodwill. Today, we have this good opportunity to gather together, and not only is a peaceful atmosphere filling the room, but also the hope for further economic cooperation in the future will surely fill the hearts of everyone present. In this time of extreme global economic downturn, ordinary people often doubt whether an international economic mission is appropriate at this time, and even doubt whether the mission's purpose is solely to promote the sale of one-sided goods. These are all superficial views. They do not understand that economic cooperation must first involve understanding each other's economic weaknesses. Otherwise, merely knowing how to utilize each other's strengths without knowing how to support each other's weaknesses will lead to resentment and blame when one country's weakness cannot receive assistance from the other party. This will eventually exhaust the benefits of utilizing each other's strengths. Today, the economic weaknesses of various countries have been revealed due to the impact of the downturn. If one wants to know the weaknesses of the Chinese economy, now is indeed the most appropriate time. Not only is it easy to discern the inherent weaknesses in China's economic foundation, but it is also easy to see the weaknesses of China's inability to resist the impact of the economic policies of various countries due to the global downturn. Our people naturally do not want to hide their weaknesses, just as a patient does not need to conceal their symptoms from others. Although there are various reasons for the global downturn, the narrow nationalistic economic policies are the root cause. All countries want to increase exports and decrease imports, resulting in more and more obstacles being set up in international trade, and the purchasing power of all countries is simultaneously declining. Even the United States, with its strong economic power, cannot escape the influence of global trends, and various measures to reverse the downturn have been tested one by one. Therefore, the recognition of the necessity for international cooperation to achieve common prosperity is deeper than that of any other country. Today, the gentlemen of the American Economic Mission can reveal the weaknesses of our country's economy to our people and discuss them together through methods of mutual assistance and cooperation. In the future, after returning to their country, they can further convey the location of China's economic weaknesses and the necessity and methods of mutual assistance and cooperation to the American government and people. Then, the benefits of this trip to the economic relations between China and the United States will be far from superficial. The gentlemen of your mission are all experienced and knowledgeable. Once you have investigated the economic situation in China, it will not be difficult to see it at a glance. We should not wait for the various groups present tonight to point it out. Before your mission departs, I would like to contribute one or two special features of China's economic situation for your reference, which I believe the gentlemen would be willing to hear. First, the urgency of China's economic construction has been commonly recognized by the government and the people, and the efforts of the government and the people in carrying out the work have already yielded considerable results. China's modern construction began after the establishment of the National Government. Recently, with Commander-in-Chief Chiang's efforts to suppress the communists and restore the countryside, it is even more urgent to realize that the progress of construction cannot be delayed any longer. To reverse prosperity, there is a greater need for large-scale construction. Once the communist bandits are eliminated and disasters are reduced, the purchasing power of the Chinese people will increase dramatically. It would not be difficult to double or multiply the current import of one billion silver dollars. At that time, China may become a major market for the world to absorb goods. Today, the materials needed for economic construction and the increased purchasing power of the people after construction are sufficient to increase the China trade of various countries. In other words, countries that participate in or assist China's economic construction are promoting their China trade. China will also be willing to purchase goods from any country that is interested in assisting China's economic construction. There is one more thing I can tell the gentlemen: the Chinese government, knowing that economic construction relies on foreign aid, must consolidate its external credibility. Since Finance Minister Kong took office, he has worked hard to consolidate external credibility, and now he has seen results and received good feedback from industrialists from various countries. Second, China is the only country in the world that purely uses silver. All of China's economic life is closely related to the price of silver. In the past, the rise and fall of silver prices were determined by the needs and supply of China and India. The more China's tangible and intangible exports, the more silver is needed. The more silver China needs, the higher the price of silver rises. As the price of silver rises, prices in China rise, and tangible exports decrease until the demand for silver decreases and the price of silver gradually flattens. Since the implementation of the US silver purchase policy, the price of silver has been artificially raised. As a result, China's silver price, based on the principle of natural supply and demand, has completely broken the trade monetary system, and everything is affected by it. The Chinese people cannot help but sigh at the ignorance of the American senators about the actual situation in China. At this critical juncture, the gentlemen of your mission have personally come to investigate. After returning to your country in the future, you will be able to convey the real situation in China to the government and people of your country and try to reduce the adverse effects on China. Then, this silver problem, which currently seems to be a very unpleasant matter in the economic relations between the two countries, or even this problem of conflicting interests, may discover a common point of cooperation and add a link to the economic relations between the two countries. However, the transformation of this direction depends on the efforts of the economic groups of the two countries, and the efforts of your mission are especially effective. I hope that the gentlemen of your mission will not think that I am being presumptuous in mentioning this matter. I would be very grateful. The gentlemen of your mission have traveled far to visit, and there must be many things you want to hear. Tonight, all the groups present are willing to provide as much information as possible so that the real situation in our country can be disclosed to you, so that the business between China and the United States can be further advanced and the friendship between the two countries can become even stronger, which is what we all deeply hope for."</p>
<p>Mission Leader's Response Forbes, the head of the American Economic Mission, then rose to speak in response, saying, "Our mission has come to China to investigate, and we are honored to have received the warm hospitality of your government authorities, your reception committee, and business leaders, and to have been given guidance. Our various investigation efforts are currently underway to promote the prosperity of trade between the two countries. We are very grateful for the assistance and guidance we have received from all sectors. We offer our thanks and wish all of you good health."</p>
<p>Yiyuan Dance Party At 10:00 p.m., the American University Club held a dance party at Yiyuan, attended by all members of the mission and Chinese and foreign guests, totaling over two hundred people. The atmosphere was very lively and pleasant.</p>
<p>Free Railway Travel The Ministry of Railways sent a letter to the reception committee yesterday, stating that the mission will be granted free travel on all railways under the ministry's jurisdiction when traveling to various locations in China to collect materials, as a sign of preferential treatment and to provide convenience.</p>
<p>Meeting for Discussion This afternoon, the entire committee of the reception committee's proposal group and the economic mission will hold an expert discussion meeting at the Cathay Hotel. This is a business discussion, and the content will not be publicly disclosed. At the same time, mission leader Forbes will go to the Capital Hotel to attend the meeting of the Pan-Pacific Association and deliver a speech. At 5:00 p.m., Finance Minister Kong will host a tea party at his private residence on Avenue Petain, inviting celebrities from various Chinese and foreign circles to accompany him. It is said that the members of the amateur music group Huaguang Music Association will participate and perform ancient Chinese music and the latest ensemble pieces to add to the enjoyment. As it was feared that the sound would be too low to reach the entire venue, several broadcasting machines were rushed to be installed yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e95">National Products Relief Association Held an Opening Ceremony Yesterday; The Temporary Market Was Opened Simultaneously; Performances and Entertainment Were Provided to Add to the Enjoyment <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Promotion and Relief Association held an opening ceremony at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Penglai Market in Xiaoximen. The temporary market was also opened simultaneously. Over three hundred representatives and guests from all walks of life attended. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Market Arrangement The venue was set up in the open space of Penglai Market in Xiaoximen, with the main entrance facing Penglai Road and Yongning Road. A pine and cypress archway was erected in front of the gate, with the words "Shanghai National Products Promotion and Relief Association" and "Promote National Products and Relieve Disaster Victims" written on it. There were couplets on both sides, "Relieving disaster victims is active internal security; promoting national products is passive resistance to foreign aggression." A performance and entertainment venue was set up in the market, with slogans and couplets presented by various sectors posted all around, which was very solemn.</p>
<p>Representatives from All Walks of Life Yesterday, the representatives from all walks of life who attended included Zhu Yangwu from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang Han from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhang Xiaolin, Qu Wenliu, Xu Shiying, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng (represented by Li Shengpei), Xu Xiaochu, Lin Kanghou, Chen Jicheng, Hu Xiyuan, Sun Chucheng, Zhang Yichen, Cao Zhigong, and guests, totaling over three hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech The meeting began at 2:00 p.m., and the presidium took their seats. After the ceremonial procedures were completed, Chairman Wang Xiaolai first reported that today is the National Products Promotion and Relief Association, which aims to relieve the disaster victims of last year's drought. But how can we save the country? We must promote national products. How can we save people? We must provide disaster relief. Today's opening of this National Products Promotion and Relief Association is to save the country and save the people, achieving two goals at once. I hope that you will no longer use foreign goods, causing silver to flow out, leading to poverty and exhaustion. By then, promotion will not be possible, etc.</p>
<p>Xu's Report Then, Xu Shiying reported that due to the drought in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang last year, the agricultural products were greatly reduced. The most tragic situation was that there was no harvest at all. Therefore, the disaster area was vast, and the victims were starving and would eat anything. People in the cities do not know such suffering. Recalling the citizens of Shanghai enjoying themselves, it is another world. Today's opening of this Promotion and Relief Association is to hope that compatriots will buy more national products to relieve the victims. I hope that you will work together to promote it, etc.</p>
<p>Party Guidance Zhu Yangwu, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said in his speech, "It has been found that our country's annual trade deficit is about 800 million yuan. Calculated by 400 million people, almost everyone has to provide two yuan to foreigners. In the future, I hope that people from all walks of life will switch to using national products so that money will not flow out. The meaning of today's meeting is to promote national products and relieve disaster victims. Although people in the cities also feel the economic decline, it is better than heaven compared to the victims. We should all work hard and provide support and relief within our means." Finally, Qu Wenliu and Chen Jicheng gave speeches, which are omitted.</p>
<p>Lin's Reply After the speeches from all walks of life, Lin Kanghou gave a reply, saying, "Today, the opening of the National Products Promotion and Relief Association has been attended by people from all walks of life. I am very honored. Now, disaster victims are everywhere, and they all need urgent relief. Promoting national products is not only saving people but also saving ourselves. I hope that you will publicize it more. More money will save more lives. I, the chairman, express my gratitude."</p>
<p>Raising the Flag and Unveiling the Ceremony After the chairman gave his reply, the military band played music, Qu Wenliu was invited to unveil the ceremony, and Xu Shiying raised the flag. The two representatives cut the ribbon separately, the national flag was raised, and the ceremony was announced to be over. Manufacturers accompanied representatives from all walks of life to visit. The temporary market was beautifully arranged and was highly praised. The Public Security Bureau sent police to maintain order in the market. The fire brigade parked a fire truck next to the market and stayed there to prevent accidents.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Leaders of Chinese Businesses and Banks Mortgage Loans Reach 20 Million; China Alone Makes 9 Million, and the Jiaotong and Four Banks Make About 5 Million; The China, Central, and Jiaotong Banks Jointly Lend 8 Million Yuan; The Banking Industry Has Implemented the Extension of Long-Term Loans Due at the End of the Quarter <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Shun Pao reports that recently in Shanghai, with the end of the quarter approaching, and due to the successive declarations of liquidation by Yongxing and Tongtai exchange houses, instability has been caused in the market. However, this situation has been fully eliminated after the authorities have tried their best to maintain it, and the major Chinese banks such as China and Jiaotong have provided substantial assistance by implementing large-scale mortgage loans. According to inquiries made by the Shun Pao reporter to the major banks, the total amount of mortgage loans recently released by the banks has exceeded 20 million yuan. China Bank has released about 9 million yuan, the China, Central, and Jiaotong Banks have jointly released about 8 million yuan, the Jiaotong and Four Banks' reserve has released about 5 million yuan, and other banks such as Shanghai, Zhongnan, Jin Cheng, and Dalu have also released more than 1 million yuan each. The interest rate is mostly within 2 cents per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<p>The Banking Industry Implements Long-Term Rollovers There are only four days left until the end of the quarter. According to the reporter's investigation yesterday, this difficulty can indeed be safely overcome. Of the 50 million yuan in long-term loans due, except for the hardware merchants who have repaid half of them, and the out-of-town merchants who have repaid them due to Yongfeng's collection of accounts, the remaining 40 million yuan can mostly be rolled over as usual. However, the interest rate must be appropriately increased, roughly by about half a yuan higher than the previous period. The interest rate for the previous period was 8 yuan. As for those that have already been transacted, the money industry has not heard of any. The banking industry has recently approved the rollover of several large loans. For example, Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, China, and Jiaotong Banks jointly lent about 500,000 yuan to Houfeng Company, with a monthly interest rate of 8.5%; China Bank lent 1.2 million yuan to the timber industry, with an interest rate of 8.75%; and China Bank lent 300,000 yuan to the pig industry, with an interest rate of 8.75%. Therefore, it is expected that in the next three days, large amounts of loans will continue to be rolled over. Therefore, yesterday, the public morale in the city became more stable.</p>
<p>The Money Market Has Eased Yesterday, the trading situation in the money market has eased even further. The premium for delayed delivery has fallen to below 25 cents, but the call loan rate has risen by several points compared to the previous day. The interest rate on mortgage loans made by the money industry is only 2 cents per day, so the higher call loan rate in the market is expected. It has almost returned to its original state. It is reported that most of the firms with shortages have now found ways to raise sufficient funds. Therefore, the difficulty at the end of the quarter can be safely overcome.</p>
<h3 id="e97">After Siam's Harsh Treatment of Overseas Chinese, the Reactions of Various Circles in Our Country; the Food Industry Advocates No Longer Purchasing Siamese Rice; the Overseas Chinese Affairs Sector Hopes to Expedite the Conclusion of a Sino-Siamese Commercial Treaty <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the various harsh measures implemented by the Siamese authorities against overseas Chinese have caused them great hardship. Therefore, people in our country have expressed dissatisfaction with the Siamese authorities. The Central News Agency reporter has interviewed various parties to explore their attitudes, as follows:</p>
<p>Opinions of the Food Industry China and Siam are neighboring countries, and there is a very close relationship in business. According to a tycoon in the food industry in Shanghai, Siam is an agricultural country, and rice is its main product, accounting for two-thirds of the total export value. The number of Siamese rice shipped to China is not small. Since the overseas Chinese He Defu returned to China last year and had contacts with the Shanghai food merchants, the quantity of imports has increased sharply. From August of last year to March of this year, the value of Siamese rice shipped to Shanghai has reached 10 million yuan. Since the Siamese authorities cannot be good neighbors and impose various harsh measures on our overseas Chinese, our merchants can only give them an economic blow. Although our country has suffered from natural and man-made disasters in recent years, resulting in poor agricultural production, we still have to rely on foreign countries. However, in terms of foreign rice, not purchasing Siamese rice will have no impact on our country. Moreover, recently, due to the economic recession in our country, Siamese rice has no market in our country. Therefore, if the Siamese authorities do not change their attitude, they will definitely no longer purchase Siamese rice.</p>
<p>News from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Sector According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs sector, the authorities should urgently conclude a Sino-Siamese commercial treaty to establish a proper national relationship between our country and Siam. Siam was originally a tributary state of ours, and even in the recent past, many nationals occupied important positions in the government of that country. Therefore, the number of our overseas Chinese who have gone to that country to do business has reached 3 million. However, in recent years, the Siamese authorities have been manipulated by the great powers. Therefore, although there have been moves to conclude a treaty between China and Siam, it has not been realized due to the lack of sincerity of the Siamese authorities. However, in terms of the relationship between the two countries, at least a minimum commercial treaty should be concluded as soon as possible. The Siamese authorities should change their attitude, considering their own interests and the importance of their relationship with China, to establish a friendly relationship between China and Siam.</p>

<p>The Zhaoxing Company's Yuxing steamer, with a deadweight of 1,599 tons, fully loaded export goods on the morning of the 25th of this month. It sailed to ports such as Longkou, Niuzhuang, and Tianjin. The majority of the cargo was 6,380 bags of white rice, 3,000 pieces of fertilizer, and over 10,000 bags of flour. Other items included miscellaneous goods like foreign cloth, tea, and cigarettes. All the ship's holds were fully loaded, and the weight carried had reached the waterline. The value of the entire ship's cargo was over 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Encountered Danger Near Sheshan: At 6:00 PM, approximately 10 nautical miles south of Sheshan, at 122 degrees 20 minutes east longitude and 32 degrees 34 minutes north latitude, the propeller of the propulsion engine suddenly fell off, causing the ship to lose its ability to move. It was left to drift in the sea, with no way to remedy the situation. The ship was heavily laden and deep in the water. If a major storm were to occur, the consequences would be unimaginable. The shipowner, a Japanese national, was at a loss, and the entire crew was extremely anxious. They immediately sent a telegram to Shanghai to report the emergency and request assistance.</p>
<p>Tugboat Rescue: After receiving the telegram that evening, the company decided overnight to hire the large Jardine Matheson tugboat "Saucy" from this port. It set out at 1:00 AM yesterday morning, rushed to the waters off Sheshan, and towed the ship back to Shanghai. A telegram was received yesterday afternoon stating that the "Saucy" tugboat had successfully towed the Yuxing steamer and was en route to Shanghai. It was expected to arrive in port around 7:00 PM that evening.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau originally established an inquiry room for users to inquire about matters and request repairs. For the South City, Zhabei, Longhua areas, dial "29"; for Pudong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Wusong areas, dial "50." The scope of inquiries was limited to standard time and repair of lines and machines. Now that the bureau has been ordered by the Ministry of Transportation to establish an inquiry desk, the original inquiry room will be expanded, the number of staff answering inquiries will be increased, and shifts will be scheduled.</p>
<p>Collecting Materials: The bureau has sent letters to the local post office, telegraph bureau, wireless telegraph station, China National Aviation Corporation, Eurasia Aviation Corporation, Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administrations, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, municipal ferries, commercial steamship companies, and the Minhang, Hutai, Husong, Shangnan, and long-distance bus companies, as well as entertainment venues and hotels, to collect traffic information for answering user inquiries.

<p>Yesterday (the 26th) was the 19th day of the Shanghai preview of the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London. The number of people from all walks of life attending the exhibition was very high, and they all had very good reviews of the various antiquities on display. The various pieces of news obtained yesterday are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Director Lei Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Adding a Catalog of Antiquities</p>
<p>Lei Zhen, the executive director of the exhibition, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing yesterday and immediately went to the exhibition hall to preside over matters. Mr. Lei also brought two large boxes of selected archaeological items from the Archaeological Division of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, totaling eleven items. After arriving at the exhibition hall, he immediately opened the boxes, organized the items, and handed them over to the second group for display. The Archaeological Division of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica also added eleven selected items, as well as a photograph and a tomb inscription, which were added for exhibition at the special request of the British selection committee. The catalog is recorded below: (1) Lower part of a stone-carved human figure; (2) Edge of a carved white pottery vessel, with the ears shaped like taotie. The above two items were unearthed from the Yin Ruins. (3) Four pieces of black pottery fragments, unearthed from Chengziya. (4) One high-footed plate. (5) Two four-eared jars. (6) Two cups, as well as a full photograph of the Bu Ren tomb and a rubbing of the Bu Ren tomb inscription. These antiquities are of great value in archaeology.</p>
<p>Date of Shipment of Antiquities to England; Explanation of Archaeological Selections</p>
<p>The date for shipping these antiquities to London for the exhibition in England has been set for June 8th. They will be transported by the British warship Suffolk. The exhibition is currently in contact with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to discuss borrowing a loading and unloading wharf. Explanations of the archaeological selections regarding divination oracle bones, oracle bone characters, deer head inscriptions, stone knives, stone axes, and bone hairpins have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, the explanations for bone tools, arrowheads, spears, axes are recorded below: (7) Bone tools. There are more bone-made tools preserved from the Yin Ruins than other types. Seven types are shown to demonstrate their general uses. (1) Bone knife: One end has a hole, and the other end has a blade; it is extremely thin and used for cutting and scraping. (2) Bone wedge: The end is extremely thick, and the end has a blade; it is used for splitting small objects. (3) Bone awl: One end is sharp, and the other end is slightly scraped. (4) Bone nail: One end is thick and pointed, and the middle part is raised, resembling a nail. (5) Bone awl: One end is sharp, and the other end is flattened. (6) Bone perch: One end has a square head, with the edge raised as a grasping part; the other end has a blade, used for carving livestock. (7) Bone perch: One end has a square head with a hole, and the other end is curved like a stream, used for wine. (8) Arrowheads: There are two types of arrowheads unearthed from the Yin Ruins: bronze and bone. The shapes of the bone arrowheads vary greatly and can be divided into four types: 1. Conical; 2. Flat; 3. Double-edged; 4. Three-edged. The third type is the most common. There is only one type of bronze arrowhead, which belongs to the third type, but the size varies. Twenty selected pieces, ten bone and ten bronze, slightly demonstrate the general changes. (9) Spears, lances, axes: Spears and lances were the most prevalent weapons during the Yin and Shang periods, used for horizontal strikes and direct thrusts. The shape of the spears is very similar to the spears of the third phase of the European Bronze Age. Hollow-headed bronze axes also appeared during this period. Six selected types, three from the Yin Ruins, one from Xincun in Junxian, an object from the early Western Zhou dynasty, and one purchased in Anyang, an object from the middle Zhou dynasty, are placed here to demonstrate the changes in spear shapes.</p>

After completing the viewing, I will briefly describe my feelings as follows: China has a culture of more than 4,000 years. In addition to the records in books, we rely on antiquities to observe the living conditions, working skills, artistic thoughts, and the efforts of our ancestors at that time. Therefore, appreciating old objects is not only about the value of the old objects themselves, but also about the culture reflected by the old objects at that time. It is not only about admiring the exquisiteness of the old objects, but also about making comparisons between the various eras. The various antiquities displayed by the exhibition have been carefully selected and organized, from ancient times to the present, and are systematically displayed according to their development strategies. Therefore, the origin of the establishment of various arts and the process of development can be known. This is truly a good opportunity for us to study the national culture. Not only artists, antiquarians, and teachers and students of various schools should go to visit, but ordinary people should also go to see it, so as to understand the situation of our national culture and cultivate a spirit of respecting art.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Overview of National Foreign Trade in the First Quarter of This Year: Exports Increased by More Than Six Million Yuan Compared to Last Year; Imports Decreased by More Than Thirty-three Million Yuan <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the situation of foreign trade in the first quarter of this year is much worse than that in the first quarter of last year. The total value of trade in the first quarter of this year is 389,818,000 yuan, which is a decrease of 26,754,000 yuan compared to 416,572,000 yuan in the same period last year. The Statistics Department of the International Trade Bureau has prepared a systematic report based on the customs records and with reference to the trade situation in the same period last year to provide a reference for those who care about international trade. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Increase in Exports, Decrease in Trade Deficit: The total value of imports in the first quarter of this year was 254,000,386 yuan, a decrease of 33,645,426 yuan compared to the same period last year. The total value of exports was 235,818,505 yuan, an increase of 6,891,568 yuan compared to the same period last year. The trade deficit was 118,181,881 yuan, a decrease of 40,537,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. This is a slightly optimistic phenomenon.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain Imports Slightly Active: Among imported commodities, there was no significant change in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. However, rice and grain imports were slightly active. This is because the drought last year resulted in insufficient domestic agricultural production to meet demand. All orders for foreign rice were successively imported in the spring of this year, so the figures increased compared to last year. It is estimated that the first quarter of this year was more than 16.6 million gold units, an increase of more than 9 million gold units compared to the same period last year. Even wheat flour increased compared to last year, reaching more than 1 million gold units in the first quarter of this year. However, wheat decreased by nearly 2 million gold units. In total, imports of miscellaneous grains in the first quarter of this year were 25,227,000 gold units, equivalent to more than 47 million national currency, an increase of more than 13 million yuan compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Sharp Decrease in Imports of Yarn, Cotton, and Cotton Goods: Imports of cotton yarn, cotton, etc. in the first quarter of this year were equivalent to more than 12 million yuan, a significant decline of more than 18 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Imports of cotton goods were equivalent to more than 6.52 million yuan, also a significant decrease compared to last year. Other items such as wood, metals, mineral sands, machinery, fish, seafood, and paper all increased, especially metals and mineral sands, which increased significantly. Sugar, vehicles, boats, metal products, tobacco, kerosene, diesel oil, etc. all tended to decline, with tobacco, kerosene, and diesel oil experiencing the largest declines.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Exports of Tung Oil and Peanuts: As for exported commodities, exports of raw silk in the first quarter of this year also declined, estimated at more than 5 million yuan, a decrease of more than 1 million yuan compared to the same period last year. The situation for tea was relatively good, estimated at more than 5.28 million yuan, a slight increase compared to the same period last year, but the amount was also small, only an increase of more than 160,000 yuan. Exports of egg products in the first quarter of this year were estimated at more than 3.9 million yuan, a decrease of more than 1 million yuan compared to the same period last year. The sluggish exports are due to the weak sales to England, because the main market for undifferentiated wet yellow and white egg whites is England. The situation for tung oil was better. In the first quarter of this year, it was estimated at more than 6.4 million yuan, an increase of more than 1.2 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Cotton was estimated at more than 3 million yuan, a decrease. Other exports such as vegetables, fish, beans, miscellaneous grains, fruits, and peanuts all increased, with peanut exports being even more robust, increasing threefold compared to the same period last year, which is slightly optimistic. Raw silk and leather goods all declined.</p>
<p>United States Ranks First Among Trading Countries: From the perspective of countries, in terms of imports, the United States still ranks first in the first quarter of this year, accounting for 19.90% of the total. It is followed by Japan, then by England, Germany, and Annam. In terms of exports, the United States also ranks first, followed by Hong Kong and Japan. The United States accounts for 24.6% of the total exports, a slight increase compared to the same period last year. Japan has declined slightly. As for the ports, Shanghai and Tianjin are both major trading ports in the north and south. Shanghai did not experience much increase or decrease in the first quarter, while Tianjin experienced a relatively large drop in exports.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Silk Merchant Zhu Zhongjia Kidnapped, Escapes Danger by Desperately Crying Out for Help, Kidnappers Brazenly Seize Him at His Doorstep and Drive Straight to Zhabei, Zhu Escapes After Being Thrown and Injured <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>At 9:15 PM the night before last, a major kidnapping case occurred inside the Old West Gate of the Nanshi district on Menghua Street. Fortunately, the victim desperately cried out for help, and the kidnappers, realizing they were in danger of being caught, threw him to the side of the road and fled in all directions, disappearing without a trace. The victim was fortunate to escape. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Self-Built Residence: No. 79 Menghua Street inside the Old West Gate of the Nanshi district is the self-built residence of Zhu Zhongjia, a native of Dongting Mountain in Suzhou. Zhu is 47 years old. He previously ran a silk shop on Beijing Road for many years. Later, as the silk industry declined, he closed the shop. However, Zhu had some assets, so he built several shikumen-style houses on Menghua Street, naming the lane Jia Zhi Lane.</p>
<p>Criminals Covet: Zhu's self-built mansion, located at No. 79 along the road in the lane, was where his entire family lived. Unexpectedly, this attracted the covetous eyes of criminals. Around 9 PM the night before last, Zhu's wife, Yan, had gone to Suzhou and had not yet returned. Zhu, his brother Yousong, and several people with the surnames Zhou and Qin were chatting in the overpass building of their residence when suddenly five or six kidnappers broke in through the back door and went straight upstairs. As soon as they saw Zhu, they pulled out a handgun and monitored everyone's movements.</p>
<p>Kidnapping in Progress: At the same time, one of the kidnappers used Zhu's phone to hire a car from Yunfei Automobile Company on Fangbang Road, Ximen: Concession No. 12300, Chinese Area No. 4263. The driver was surnamed Lu. Once the car arrived at Zhu's house, two of the kidnappers dragged Zhu downstairs, forced him into the car, put a pair of black glasses on him, and ordered the driver to take the car to Yongxing Road in Zhabei.</p>
<p>Desperate Cry for Help: On the way, the driver, surnamed Lu, noticed that the men looked suspicious and unusual. Realizing something was wrong, he dared not speak out to avoid endangering himself. When the car arrived at the entrance of Maoying Dyeing Factory at No. 70 Yongxing Branch Road and stopped, the two kidnappers forced Zhu out of the car, planning to hide in their den on foot. Seeing this, Zhu desperately cried out that he was being kidnapped. The kidnappers, realizing their plan was failing, threw Zhu forcefully to the ground and fled in all directions.</p>
<p>Escorted to Nanshi: Zhu injured his foot in the fall and was unable to get up for a while. Fortunately, the driver, surnamed Lu, was alert and drove the car back, helped Zhu into the car, and reported to the Yongxing Road Police Station of the North Station Branch Bureau. The police chief, Chen Jiwu, briefly questioned Zhu. Since the case occurred within the jurisdiction of the Wenmiao Road Police Station in Nanshi, he ordered patrol officer Tong Boya to escort Zhu to the Wenmiao Road Police Station.</p>
<p>Medical Treatment: Police Chief Tang then questioned Zhu in detail and immediately reported to the headquarters, instructing all detective teams to pay attention to intercepting the kidnappers. Police Chief Tang also escorted Zhu Zhongjia to his home and called the famous bone-setting doctor Shi Xiaoshan for treatment. It was reported that a long period of recovery was required.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Excessive Quantity of Foreign Rice, 700,000 Bags Canceled with Foreign Firms, Buyers Were Small and Medium-Sized Rice Merchants in Northern and Southern Markets, Approximately One Million Bags of Foreign Rice Currently in Shanghai <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of rice merchants and banks in Shanghai and other ports ordering a total of over 6.2 million bags of foreign rice from Saigon, Siam, etc., 700,000 of these bags were ordered by small and medium-sized merchants. Fearing that an oversupply of foreign rice would lead to losses and impact the market, they canceled their contracts with the managing foreign firms. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Total Quantity of Foreign Rice Arrived: After various provinces in China experienced floods and droughts last year, resulting in poor harvests, rice merchants and banks in Shanghai and other ports entrusted 17 foreign firms, including Heyi and Dalong, to order foreign rice from Saigon, Siam, and Xiaojiao, totaling over 6.2 million bags. These were shipped to Shanghai in batches, starting from October last year to April 20th of this year. The total quantity of foreign rice that arrived in Shanghai and Ningbo was approximately 5 million bags.</p>
<p>700,000 Bags Canceled: Among the over 6.2 million bags of foreign rice, 700,000 bags were ordered by small and medium-sized merchants in the northern and southern markets of Shanghai. After a large amount of foreign rice was imported into China, the government and various organizations paid great attention due to the impact on the rural economy. Furthermore, with fluctuating rice prices, rice merchants with smaller financial resources felt uneasy, fearing future losses and fundamental disruptions to their businesses. To maintain stability, they canceled contracts with the managing foreign firms last week, totaling over 700,000 bags. The rice merchants voluntarily compensated the foreign firms for breach of contract according to the original orders.</p>
<p>Quantity of Foreign Rice in Shanghai: Of the 5 million bags of foreign rice already shipped to Shanghai, 4 million bags have been sold inland. Currently, there are only about 1 million bags of foreign rice stored in Shanghai. However, there are over 1.2 million bags in various other locations. Now that 700,000 bags have been canceled, there are only 500,000 bags that have not yet been shipped from overseas.</p>

<p>Since the Pudong Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association established a branch in Xilingjiazhai, it has been diligently working on village administration, sanitation, and education. From the very beginning, they have operated a pilot daycare center with the aim of increasing farmers' productivity, improving children's habits, and reducing infant mortality rates. During this busy farming season, the number of children needing care has increased, and the existing facility has become inadequate. After discussions between Lu Xiaoxiang, the director of the branch, Deng Huaguang, the director of education at the daycare center, and Ling Risheng, Ling Fengsheng, and Ling Jingsheng (founders, the late Ling Langxuan), principals of the Jiu Si Primary School in the village, it was decided to use the school's premises to expand the daycare center. They have graciously agreed and plan to move in and officially open on May 1st to meet the public's needs.</p>

<p>In order to attract cocoon transport, the Railway Bureau, in the previous cocoon season, instructed the Traffic Department to assign dedicated personnel from various traffic departments to be responsible for reception. Now that the cocoon season is approaching again, the department has not only instructed various sections to broadly attract cocoon transport but also ordered them to follow the previous example, assigning personnel to each cocoon transport station within their respective sections to be specifically responsible for reception. Staff at each station should transport as much as possible to benefit merchants, regardless of office hours. Furthermore, this year's cocoon transport rates, for less than full carloads, are lower than last year. A table of cocoon transport rates and miscellaneous fees has been specially compiled and distributed to each station for merchants to consult.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Lixing Thermos Factory Expands Operations, New Factory Site Built <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Thermos bottles are essential household items. In the past, imported goods flooded the market, resulting in an astonishing amount of annual leakage. Mr. Gan Dounan, a Ningbo merchant, was concerned about this and, in 1928, invested in establishing the Lixing Thermos Factory on Dongyouheng Road in Shanghai, specializing in the production of Great Wall brand thermos bottles. Immersed in diligent research and careful study, after several years of painstaking operation, the products reached more than 40 varieties. Known for their novel designs and accurate temperature retention, they are praised by society. Recently, Mr. Gan used his ingenuity to invent a rubber-wrapped mouth that tightly wraps the bottle mouth, preventing water seepage, completely solving the only major problem of rust water inside the thermos bottle. Mr. Gan's profound achievements can be seen from this. Recognizing that the supply of goods could not meet the demand, the factory found that its original location was insufficient for its operations. Therefore, it purchased land on Quanjia'an Road in Zhabei to build a state-of-the-art factory building, adopting scientific management in order to increase production. After several months of construction, it has recently been fully completed. The vast buildings are connected, and Mr. Gan's perseverance and knowledge are worthy of being a model for our industrial sector.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented a unified tax on alcohol, (ordinary tax of 13 cents per liter was changed to 6.5 cents per liter for modified alcohol) the cosmetics and new pharmaceutical industries, using alcohol as an essential industrial raw material, have seen increased costs after the unified tax was levied, indirectly fostering opportunities for foreign goods to be dumped on the market. Therefore, they have repeatedly submitted requests to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to be forwarded to the central government, requesting that the unified tax on alcohol used for industrial purposes be refunded. So far, no approval has been received. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has specially sent letters to the Municipal Society for the Promotion of National Goods, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the National Goods Datong Alliance, the National Goods Factories Association, the Mechanized National Goods Factories Association, and other national goods organizations, scheduling a joint meeting to jointly request a tax refund.</p>

In addition, there are hand scrolls by Wang Xizhi, figures by Bada Shanren, gourds, Mi Fu, Dong Qichang, Liu Yong, Huang Tingjian, Yue Wu Mu, and other ink treasures, which can all make people linger.

<h3 id="e116">Recent News from the Isola Circus <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Since the Isola Circus of England opened on the open space across from the Great World, it has been crowded with spectators every day, and the scene has been unprecedented in Shanghai. According to general opinion, the programs performed by the Isola Circus this week are very exciting, especially the "King of Heaven" and "Cuban Cossack Knights" acts. The so-called "King of Heaven" refers to aerial acrobats. Four performers climb onto the trapeze, flipping and soaring through the air, which is quite thrilling. The four Cuban knights are incomparably brave. They can somersault off the horse while the horse is galloping, or hook one foot on the horse's back and drag their hands on the ground. The audience applauded and exclaimed. When performing in Australia, an American circus offered a large sum of money to buy the actors of the above two acts, but all the actors loved Isola's character and never moved by the heavy interest. Respectable! In addition, in one of the scenes where lions and tigers performed together, the conductor was an Indian who entered the lion and tiger enclosure barehanded, with a stern look and a commanding voice. The audience was amazed. Also, this time, the Isola Grand Beast Garden has 300 kinds of rare birds and animals, which are open daily from 7 am, noon, and 9 pm to 5 pm. The entrance fee is 20 cents for adults and 10 cents for children. It is reported that the troupe owner, Isola, is kind and loving and will hold special performances for children, soldiers, and sailors in the future. It is currently being planned. There are currently two shows every day, a day show at 5 pm and a night show at 9:15 pm. The ticket prices are low, and children's tickets are only half price for the day show.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, at around 4 PM, Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road in Zhabei received a man wounded by an ax, sent by police from the North Station Branch Bureau. At the time, the injured man was unable to speak. The person accompanying him said that the man's name was He Shanzeng, 33 years old, from Yixing, currently living in Zhongshan Lane on Zhongshan Road, etc. After the doctor's examination, it was found that He Shanzeng had been struck with an ax on his right temple and jaw, each about an inch deep. The blood vessels had been severed, and all the blood had drained out, so he died the next afternoon. However, the deceased was injured within the jurisdiction of the North Station Branch Bureau, but died at the hospital within the jurisdiction of the Xinzha Branch Bureau. Therefore, the hospital reported to the Xinzha Branch Bureau, which sent police to investigate. Chief Ruan of the branch ordered Lu Abin, the local security officer of the 11th district, to report to the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy yesterday morning. At 3:25 PM, Prosecutor Xiao Jinying arrived at the scene and found that the deceased, He Shanzeng, had indeed died from his injuries. He immediately filled out a burial certificate and ordered the security officer to arrange for the burial and wait for the arrest of the murderer. Later, the security officer investigated and summoned the deceased's family to the scene. They stated that the murderer who killed He Shanzeng was originally a friend of the deceased. He had previously borrowed money from He to open a shop, but the shop was never opened, and the money was used up. This time, he wanted to borrow money from He again, but was unsuccessful, which caused him to hold a grudge and commit this heinous act. The body was prepared by the deceased's family with a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Lawsuit of a Movie Actress <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Wang Huijuan, a movie actress of the Star Film Company, is originally from Tianjin, 25 years old, and lives with her old mother at No. 9, Lane 120, Fuli Road, French Concession. Recently, because the Shanghai Daily continuously published her life, actions, and current living conditions, Wang believes that the newspaper's records are mostly speculative and have the intention of slandering her reputation. Therefore, she hired lawyers Jin Xinmin and Jin Yumin to file a criminal complaint of defamation against the newspaper's editors and publishers, Yu Lansun and Dong Qimeng, in the First Special District Court. The complaint states that since entering the film industry, she has been clean and self-respecting, but the environment is limiting. She once felt weary of the world. The newspaper actually continuously recorded matters related to her weariness of the world on March 30, April 1, 2, and 4, using knowingly false facts as material for deliberate defamation. It also lists three points of false information recorded by the Shanghai Daily, stating that her personal reputation has been completely ruined, and the entire film industry has been disgraced. She requests that the defendants be summoned to court and punished according to law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao opened the court to hear the case. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendants were present in person. Defendant Yu Lansun sent a letter in advance to request the court to postpone the hearing and stated that there was no such person as Dong Qimeng in the newspaper. However, the plaintiff's lawyers claimed that Dong Qimeng was one of the investors in the newspaper, according to an investigation by the Municipal Party Department, and that Dong Qimeng was also listed in the registration application submitted by the newspaper. Lawyer Jin then elaborated on the prosecution's intention, stating that the various sections recorded by the newspaper were quite lewd and truly unbearable to read. Therefore, he specially presented the newspaper to the court for review. Judge Ye glanced at it briefly and instructed that the newspaper be kept on file and that the hearing be rescheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Robbery on Connaught Road, Arrested <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>On March 26th at around 4 AM, Xiong Falu, a resident of No. 232, Connaught Road, was robbed of 120 double-horn tickets and one single-horn ticket. The escaped robbers were not caught by the Jiaxing Road police station in charge. The day before yesterday, Huatamu Bao Shuji of the Hongkou police station learned that the perpetrator, Ni Jiazeng (also known as Zhang Jinfa, the third son) of Jiangbei, 34 years old, was hiding at No. 18, Tongji Road, Zhabei. So he rushed there with detectives from the Public Security Bureau to arrest and bring him back, and then transferred him to the Jiaxing Road police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Bureau, stated in the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court that there were two accomplices already apprehended, namely Chen Weizhi and Chong Guoxi from Jiangbei, who resisted arrest with guns and injured a Hua-Ri policeman at No. 362, Wuzhou Road, Jingwei Lane, on the evening of the 17th of this month at 9 PM. They were also involved in the robbery. Now, the defendant Chen is in court to testify. Upon questioning, the defendant Ni Jiazeng stated that he did not know Chen Weizhi and denied robbing the property of the pedestrian surnamed Xiong. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Chen Weizhi, who was arrested for the robbery, testified that the Connaught Road robbery was committed by him, the defendant, Chong Guoxi, Wang Laoer, and others. This is true. Judge Jiang Shuzi instructed that they be remanded in custody and the matter be clarified and verified at a later date.</p>

<p>Jiang Weibao, a woman from Wuxi, 21 years old, is fairly pretty. She used to live in the countryside in her hometown. Her father, Jiang Yongjia, remarried after his wife passed away. His new wife was quite fierce, causing Jiang to be unwelcome by her stepmother. A woman named Wang Sanyuan, who knew Jiang Yongjia well, took advantage of the opportunity to introduce Jiang to Shanghai to find work. She brought the woman to Shanghai and lived at No. 35, Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road. This was around April of last year. In early May, Wang Sanyuan used threats and sweet words to deceive Jiang Weibao and force her into prostitution. She had no choice but to obey. From then on, she was no longer pure and became a victim. This lasted for about four months. Jiang suffered greatly and contracted venereal disease and leucorrhea. Her life was no different from hell. Therefore, on December 21st of last year, she seized the opportunity to escape and, with the help of a patron, was treated at the Southeast Medical Clinic. She has not fully recovered to this day. Now, Jiang has filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, accusing Wang Sanyuan of restricting her freedom. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Feng Shide opened Criminal Division 1 to hear the case. The summons for Wang Sanyuan was not delivered, so she did not appear in court. After Jiang reported the situation, Judge Feng decided to reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>Around 12:00 pm on the 25th, a Jiangbei scavenging child, about 12 or 13 years old, found a steel bomb resembling a one-pound thermos bottle from an unknown location. He was examining it under the electric light in front of the five-story Western-style building of Dayifang, across from Ruifuli on Dongzilaihuo Street, French Concession. The bomb seemed quite heavy, with a copper button at one end. Passersby stopped to watch, saying that it was a shrapnel bomb and extremely dangerous. The child was very frightened when he heard this, so he put the bomb in the trash can in front of No. 19 and turned to leave. Later, a neighbor at that location ran to tell the patrolling police. The police arrived and checked the trash can and found that it was indeed a bomb. They then reported back to the police station and sent detectives to take the bomb back to the police station. In addition to disposing of it, they will also investigate the origin of the bomb for verification.</p>

<p>Xie Wenquan, a clerk at the law firm of Lawyer Mao Xianshen at 34 Jin Yuli, Lubage Road, was recently accused by Chen Guanyun, a native of Dongtai, Jiangbei, residing at 29 Beiyi'an Lane, Caojiadu, along with witnesses Yan Lianqi and Wang Yongbao, of assaulting him in Mao's law office on the 17th of this month at 10:20 AM, causing head injuries and damage to his scrotum. They requested an investigation from the Xinzha police. After an initial investigation, Chen was sent to Renji Hospital, where his injuries were confirmed. A warrant was obtained from the First Special District Court, and Xie Wenquan was summoned to the Second Criminal Division yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu initiated a public prosecution for assault under Article 293 of the Criminal Code, presenting the medical report as evidence. Plaintiff Chen Guanyun stated that he married Jia Caili, a woman from Yangzhou, last August. After living together for only a few months, Wu absconded with all their belongings, emulating Hong Fu's elopement. After searching extensively without success, he reported the matter to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau in Caojiadu, which was approved. On the 15th of this month, he received a letter from Lawyer Mao Xianshen, representing Wu Caili, stating that Wu wanted a divorce and requesting a meeting at Mao's law office. Therefore, he went to Mao's office on the 17th at 8:00 AM with friends Yan Lianqi and Wang Yongbao. As Lawyer Mao had not yet risen, they left and waited at a nearby</p>
<p>teahouse for a while. Soon, they saw his wife, Wu Caili, entering Mao's law office with the defendant, Xie Wenquan, hand in hand. They followed them inside. Once inside the office, he, the defendant, and Wu Caili went into a small room, while the others were not allowed to enter. The defendant took out a blank sheet of paper and asked him to sign it. After he signed, the defendant said that signing meant they were divorced. He refused. At that time, his wife tried to leave, and he tried to stop her. Lawyer Mao then slapped him and grabbed his collar, ordering the defendant Xie Wenquan</p>
<p>to tightly squeeze his scrotum. He cried out in pain, and the defendant released him and ran away. He chased after him and encountered a Chinese detective, and they all went to the police station. He is now accusing the defendant Xie Wenquan and Lawyer Mao Xianshen of joint assault. Witnesses Yan Lianqi and Wang Yongbao testified that they witnessed Chen being beaten. Wu Caili stated that she was eighteen years old and from Yangzhou. She had studied opera since childhood and sang in various restaurants and hotels. Last August, Chen Guanyun forcibly married her, compelling her to live with him. Unable to bear the abuse, she left in September and now lives with her mother, Wu Xu, at 181 Hengtong Road, Zhabei. She commissioned Lawyer Mao to write</p>
<p>a letter to Chen requesting a divorce. On that day, she went to Lawyer Mao's office, and Chen grabbed her, trying to pull her back. She refused, leading to a conflict, but there was no beating. Xie Wenquan denied the assault. Lawyer Mao Xianshen testified that Chen and Wu Caili did argue that day. Chen insisted on taking Wu away, but Wu refused. He tried to mediate and forbade them from arguing in the office. Chen</p>
<p>was aggressive and refused to listen. He then called the police. There was no fighting. Wu Caili's mother, Wu Xu, testified that her daughter was forcibly taken away by Chen to live with him. Chen is an unemployed rogue who specializes in extortion. Five years ago, he injured his own leg in a case involving a woman and extorted hundreds of yuan. After comparing the testimonies with British Judge Hua, he adjourned the case to next Wednesday morning for further hearing.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Haining Drought Relief Association held a committee meeting at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Xu Shenru, Shi Shaochu, Yao Wenfu, Xu Yongzuo, Zha Zhongjian, Shen Huachen, Feng Liutang, Wang Weigeng, and Yan Esheng. Xu Zhongru chaired the meeting. The chairman reported on the handling of relief fund contributions. After discussion, it was decided to express gratitude to Mr. Shi Yonggeng for donating a large sum for disaster relief in the county on behalf of the beneficiaries. It was resolved to build a Shi Liangcai Memorial Garden along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway as a place for travelers to rest. A committee will be formed to handle all construction matters.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Instructs on Appealing Stamp Tax Assessments; Appeals Should Be Filed Within Five Days of Judgment <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a statement saying that the city has been very strict lately regarding stamp tax inspections. According to current regulations, after an inspection, the case should be sent to the court for trial. After being inspected and before the court hearing, all stores should review their seized books and records to determine whether stamps are required and whether they are sufficient, according to the current stamp tax regulations. They can consult with their respective trade associations or request instructions from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to present during the hearing. If they disagree with the court's judgment, they should file an appeal with the competent higher court within five days of receiving the ruling, according to the Ministry's regulations. Following the example of requesting the trade association to request the Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter for exemption will not only be unhelpful but will also miss the statutory appeal deadline.</p>

<p>The American merchant company, Haining &amp; Co., previously discovered that Jin Yuehan, who opened the Huierkang Candy Store at Fukangli, Daxi Road, Jing'an Temple Road in this port, had counterfeited the trademark of the company's Sweetheart Candy wrapper. It filed a lawsuit with the District Court for investigation. It has been learned that the case has been concluded, with a verdict stating that the defendant's actions warrant a sentence of two months imprisonment under Article 268 of the Illegal Acts Law. However, considering that the defendant had only recently taken over Xu Linsen's business for a short time, that he had changed the candy wrapper after receiving notice from Haining &amp; Co., and that he has not been sentenced to penal servitude or a higher penalty, it is in compliance with the conditions for a suspended sentence under Article 90, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Therefore, according to Article 315 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the verdict is as stated in the main text, with a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>Lawyer Shan Yinghui, style name Yunhui, a native of Shanghai, graduated from the Shanghai Law and Politics College. He joined the Shanghai Bar Association in April of last year and joined the Dalu Law Firm to practice law. Mr. Shan is young and handsome, skilled in his work, and widely connected, so his legal practice is thriving.

<p>Mr. Chen Zuogan, the manager of the Lianhua Woolen Mill on North Henan Road in this city, has a keen eye for social psychology. Several years ago, he created dozens of kinds of domestic swimwear and sportswear to meet the needs of all sectors. Since its inception, it has been very popular. Due to the New Life Movement, swimming is listed as one of the compulsory sports, and the successful production of dehydrated wool has led to an overwhelming number of orders for the factory's Sanlun Shuanglun swimwear from various ports, creating a situation where they are struggling to keep up with demand. Recently, the factory has also created a new type of pure silk men's short socks, which are manufactured using scientific methods and chemical dyeing. The production rate is very rapid. Statistics show that the consumption rate of these socks is the highest among Westerners, especially sailors from various countries who buy them back home to give to relatives and friends. Due to the excessive number of swimwear orders, the factory is working around the clock to increase production, with employees working in shifts. The factory's efforts in production and quality improvement are commendable and can help reverse some of China's import surplus of foreign goods.</p>

<p>"Flying Kill" Liquid Sells Well in Season. "Flying Kill" liquid, carefully manufactured by Allie Pharmacy, has the function of disinfecting, sterilizing, and eliminating flies, bedbugs, mosquitoes, lice, dog fleas, ants, flower insects,蛀虫 and all other pests. It has always been favored by noble families who love cleanliness and is considered a necessity for summer hygiene. Since its launch, it has been popular far and wide. Every summer, the supply is especially unable to meet the demand. Now that the weather is getting hotter, pests are breeding everywhere, hindering hygiene and greatly affecting health. Therefore, those who pay attention to hygiene are rushing to buy it. In recent days, the "Flying Kill" liquid sold at a reduced price at the Yong'an Sincere Western Medicine Department on Nanjing Road has been continuously bustling with customers. It is also heard that the liquid is sold in major pharmacies.</p>

Customers from near and far came one after another to buy, which can be described as a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Nanyang Ballroom to Hold Costume Dance Tonight. North Sichuan Road has always been known as the "street of mystery," with numerous dance halls lined up.

The service is particularly thoughtful, and each dance ticket can get six tickets, and tea dance tickets have as many as eight tickets. Tea and snacks are given away every time, and the Western food is especially cheap and good. Therefore, although the dance hall has not been open for long, it is full of guests every night. Now, the manager of the hall, Mr. Zhou, has decided to hold a costume dance tonight from 5:00 to 8:00 after the tea dance party to thank the guests for their kindness.

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Another year has passed since the last general meeting of shareholders. During this past year, the domestic economy has become increasingly difficult, and it has been difficult to advance the bank's business, and it has not been possible to retreat. At a crossroads, there is no place to stand. Therefore, after repeated deliberation, we can only strive to fulfill the bank's mission of developing industry. On the one hand, we will improve internal work and increase efficiency, and on the other hand, we will cooperate with all parties to seek adjustments. Regarding the expansion of the business network, there are the establishment of branches in coastal ports and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as the establishment of agricultural warehouses. The area from Qinzhong to Jin Sui in the northwest is also an area to be developed. All measures are aimed at assisting the rural economy and regulating commercial finance. Although the times are difficult and there are many thorny issues, we will find a corresponding way out by adhering to the direction and opening up paths. The following is a summary of the domestic and foreign economic situation, a brief description of the bank's progress, and the future direction of our efforts. Please examine them carefully.</p>
<p>(1) Situation in the Domestic and Foreign Economic Circles</p>
<p>In recent years, the domestic economy has been extremely depressed, and financial business has also become increasingly tight. The internal reasons for this are due to the invasion of major disasters and human misfortunes and the imperfect management methods, while the external reasons are due to the pressure of the international economy, that is, the prevailing inflation in various countries and the role of controlled economy. Almost none of them are not related to the interests of China's economic undertakings, and none of them are not related to the gains and losses of financial business. Therefore, none of the phenomena are not contrary to the form of the domestic economic society. As a result, financial undertakings based on the economic society can only increase difficulties and cannot coordinate. Internally, they are troubled by the decline of industry and commerce, and externally, they are affected by the pressure of the international economy. The seriousness of the problem can be seen in general. Now, to explore the external reasons, let us first examine the situation in the domestic and foreign economic circles for comparison.

<h3 id="e146">Review of Ten Lectures on Chinese Philosophy <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Gaoyong</p>
<p>Written by Li Shicen, published by World Book Company, priced at two yuan</p>
<p>This is a collection of lectures by Mr. Shi Cen before his death, which was recently published after his death. The content includes: a comparative study of Chinese philosophy and Western philosophy, the Confucian view of logic, the Mohist theory of Shangtong and its practical spirit, the Taoist view of the universe, the nominalist concept of dialectics and formal logic, the philosophy of the Doctrine of the Mean, what is Neo-Confucianism, the theory of the unity of body and use, the philosophy of life, and other ten articles. Among the ten articles, the first article, "Comparative Study of Chinese Philosophy and Western Philosophy," can be said to be a general article, and it can also be said to be his methodology for lecturing on Chinese philosophy. Therefore, we only need to read this article to know what attitude he takes to understand Chinese philosophy, and we can also know whether his understanding of Chinese philosophy is accurate.</p>
<p>When Mr. Li was alive, he often thought that his philosophical views had changed, from idealism to materialism, and it was still "new materialism," that is, dialectical materialism. However, we have not seen any new methods or insights from the articles and books he published until his death. Moreover, because of the fixed views of idealism for many years, suddenly adding a few so-called "new materialism" phrases and terms can be considered a bit of "drawing a tiger and failing to resemble it." This "Ten Lectures on Chinese Philosophy" seems to represent his more thorough views after the transformation. Therefore, if we only look at his personal articles and books, this book can be said to be "Li Shicen's works," because so-called works should at least be based on a "consistent method" and be able to "explain" the things being lectured on. If only a lot of facts and theories are arranged and described, then it can only be said to be "compilation and narration," and it is not enough to speak of works. Therefore, we say that if we look at the books published by Li Shicen personally, his "Philosophy of Life" and "Introduction to Philosophy" can only be said to be "compilation and narration," and only this book can be said to be his "works." However, if we look at it from the perspective of real works, whether this book is qualified to be a work is another question.</p>
<p>The content of this book is entirely based on the method of comparison between Chinese and Western cultures. Therefore, he compares Confucius with Socrates, Mencius with Plato, Xunzi with Aristotle, Zhuang Lao with Heraclitus, Zhu Hui'an, Wang Yangming with Aquinas, Scotus, and compares Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism with scholastic philosophy. He compared Wang Chuanshan, Yan Xizhai, and Dai Dongyuan with Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, and so on, there is no need to list them all. This comparative method can indeed give readers a lot of inspiration, but the disadvantages of forced association also arise from this. We know that "analogy" is the simplest and easiest method to make mistakes in logic. Therefore, it cannot be used casually unless it is under extremely strict conditions and only when it is absolutely necessary. Religious people are best at using this method to preach, and idealists are also best at using this method to talk about metaphysics. Mr. Li lectured on Chinese philosophy and compared it with Western philosophy everywhere. Although it is more brilliant than religious people and metaphysicians using metaphors to preach and lecture, it still fails to transcend the extremely simple and easy-to-err "analogy." In other words, he ultimately failed to analyze and explain the facts and theories themselves so that people could grasp a clear concept. For example, he compared Zhu Hui'an, Wang Yangming with Aquinas, and Scotus, saying: "It can be seen that their hypocritical minds are the same." (Page 22) He also said: "Wang Yangming is an extreme idealist. He feels that Zhu Hui'an's idealism is not enough." (Page 337) We don't care whether Zhu Hui'an, Wang Yangming, Aquinas, and Scotus are the same, that is, in terms of Wang Yangming and Zhu Hui'an, why can the two factions be opposed? Isn't this a huge question that people who lecture on Chinese philosophy should quickly explain to us? However, Mr. Li only used the sentence "He felt that Zhu Hui'an's idealism was not enough" to perfunctorily deal with it. If so, why "lecture?" Of course, Mr. Li explained the reasons for the occurrence of Neo-Confucianism, saying: "The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer... This is also the "cause" that promoted Chinese philosophy to extreme idealism." (Page 286) It seems that he has explained it a bit, but when we think that in today's world, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, but there is a prevalence of materialist philosophy, we feel that Mr. Li's explanation is still inexplicable.</p>
<p>Mr. Li also knows! "From the formal point of view, Chinese philosophy and Western philosophy do have many similarities, but when it comes to substance, there are many differences (page 27). But after reading the whole book, we only see him comparing the two from time to time, but we have not seen him being able to clearly explain the essence of Chinese philosophy. Then, the so-called "observing from the dialectical point of view," "observing from the materialist point of view," "observing from the dialectical materialist point of view" (see the first lecture) are just a set of fashionable decorations.</p>
<p>Although, this book is still the best book among Li's books. Mr. Li is dead. Those who want to read Mr. Li's works can buy it and read it.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Reading "The Philosophy of Life" <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuying</p>
<p>Published by Zhengzhong Bookstore, priced at six cents</p>
<p>Generally, people who study philosophy admit that the development of human spiritual knowledge can be divided into three stages, namely: (1) dogmatic, (2) skeptical, and (3) critical. But if we link the epistemology and ontology of philosophy together and observe them together, then the development of the ontology of philosophy can also be divided into three stages, namely: (1) theism, (2) from idealism to materialism, and (3) from empiricism to the philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Originally, when we study philosophy, epistemology and ontology cannot be mechanically separated. Although some scholars often only care about one and forget the other when discussing, forgetting epistemology when discussing ontology, and forgetting ontology when discussing epistemology, in fact, the connection between epistemology and ontology will never be severed by scholars' neglect and forgetfulness. In fact, the development of the ontology of philosophy itself develops with the development of human spiritual knowledge. For example, in the period when human knowledge is dogmatic and arbitrary, the explanation of all natural phenomena and human behaviors is only the responsibility of God. God is the most dogmatic and arbitrary thing, and God can be said to be the ontology of religious philosophy.</p>
<p>Dogmatic and arbitrary knowledge is shaken in the end, because God cannot explain everything in the universe, and the existence of God is also shaken. At this time, dogmatic knowledge and the theistic ontology collapse at the same time, and we enter the skeptical epistemology and the idealistic and materialistic ontology: in this period, mankind is liberated from the prison of God, and everything must be doubted, and the universe is loved and explained. Therefore, idealism and materialism are born from this skeptical epistemology. Idealism and materialism are born from skeptical epistemology, but later, when the systems of idealism and materialism are determined, the mind and matter also become "God," and the color of doubt is reduced or even eliminated.</p>
<p>However, whether it is idealism or materialism, they still cannot shoulder the responsibility of explaining natural phenomena and human behavior. Therefore, human skeptical knowledge has to move towards critical knowledge. With the progress of epistemology, the ontology will naturally progress with it. In the process of critical epistemology, mankind produced science. First, there was natural science, and then there was social science. Various departments of science were used to make analytical explanations of natural phenomena and human behavior. The remaining task of philosophy was to make comprehensive explanations. Therefore, the so-called idealism and materialism had to retreat and disappear in front of science. "Materialism? Where is matter! Idealism? The mind is about to die!" In this critical scientific world, Mr. Chen Lifu's sigh is really not accidental.</p>
<p>Human knowledge has entered the critical stage, and idealistic philosophy and materialistic philosophy can no longer exist. Therefore, empiricism and philosophies similar to empiricism have emerged like mushrooms after a rain. Empiricist philosophy still carries a strong color of skepticism in terms of epistemology, at most it is close to criticism. At the same time, in terms of ontology, some people say that it is a dualistic philosophy. In fact, we might as well say that it is an elementless philosophy. The empiricist philosophy, precisely because it is an elementless philosophy, its very existence is suspended and has nowhere to go. As a result, it can only be trapped in skepticism forever and cannot progress to correct criticism. Only the philosophy of life can accept the spirit of critical criticism correctly. "Life is the center of the universe, and people's livelihood is the center of human history." Mr. Sun Yat-sen determined the ontology of his philosophy in this way. At the same time, in terms of past philosophy, "one God" is really just a symbol of life, and the so-called "mind and matter are one" is really just two sides of life. From the side of life, it is the mind, and from the other side, it is matter. There is absolutely no isolated mind in the world, nor is there an isolated matter. However, idealists and materialists insist on pulling half of their bodies to isolate them. If history could speak, it would really cry out loudly!</p>
<p>The publication of Mr. Chen Lifu's "Philosophy of Life" not only consolidated the theoretical foundation of the Chinese revolution. After its system is completely established, I believe it will also make the greatest contribution to world philosophy? However, the reporter cannot help but regret that "The Philosophy of Life" has only published the first volume, and in this first volume, the system of explanation is not very clear. It is very difficult to read, and this has to require the original author to seek remedy as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e154">By a Difference of Two Points, Central Loses to Xie Xing, Result 39 to 37, Central Team Departs for Suzhou Today <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After the Central Party Headquarters basketball team came to Shanghai, it won four and lost one. Yesterday's match against Xie Xing was the team's last battle in Shanghai. It was held at the Shen Garden basketball court at 6 PM. It is learned that Xie Xing is organized by the Xie Xing Sports Equipment Company, mainly composed of the Fudan University team, and Pan Chengbin of Dongya Sports College was also invited to join. Their strength is very strong. The competition between the two teams was fierce and the performance was spectacular. As a result, Xie Xing defeated Central by a difference of 39 to 37, two points.</p>
<p>Tie After the start, Tian Kang of Central opened the scoring with a free throw. Unexpectedly, Zhou Dayun of Xie Xing scored four consecutive goals in an instant, and the momentum was great. Central immediately adopted a delaying tactic to temporarily avoid the edge. Liu Daguan worked harder with his elusive appearances, and Tian Kang, not willing to lag behind, immediately caught up. Sure enough, he succeeded in scoring ten points quickly and took the lead with 11 to 10, one point ahead. After Qiu Guangxie of Xie Xing returned a goal, Tian Kang of Central added two points again, still taking the lead with 13 to 12. Zhou Dayun's free throw tied the score at 13 to 13.</p>
<p>Leading Thereafter, Central only had the power to follow, and Xie Xing led the way. However, the difference was only two or three points. Zhou Dayun of Xie Xing made the most contributions, while Central relied on the achievements of Tian and Liu. The defense of both sides was very impressive. At the end of the first half, Xie Xing had 25 points and Central had 19 points. In the second half, Xie Xing used three substitutes. At the beginning, the situation was still very prosperous. After a long stalemate, Chuan Ruixiang quickly scored two goals, and Han and Zhang each made contributions. Liu and Tian of Central lost momentum, and Jin Fei rose up, scoring three consecutive goals. Liu Daguan added two points again, restoring the original state, making it 33 to 27, still 6 points behind Xie Xing.</p>
<p>Pressing Although Xie Xing replaced the official personnel one after another, they ultimately relied on the three reserve troops as the main force, so their vigor was difficult to maintain for a long time. Central was pressing hard, step by step. Liu Daguan performed the best, while Tian Kang scored the most points. The scores were repeatedly chased up. Xie Xing was trapped in defense and could not use it. The situation became more and more tense. Finally, Central relied on one throw and one free throw from Liu and Tian, creating 37 to 39, with a difference of only two points. It is a pity that there was no more time, and Central lost to Xie Xing by a difference of two points. Referee: Dai Changlin. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Xie Xing Throwing Fouls Score Central Throwing Fouls Score</p>
<p>Pan Chengbin 2 0 1 4 Kang Shaohua 0 1 3 1</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun 9 3 1 3 Liu Daguan 6 0 1 12</p>

<p>The International Games in this city are scheduled to be held on May 18th and 19th. The Chinese preliminary selection is also scheduled by the committee to be held at Shen Garden on May 3rd and 5th. Track and field athletes from Dongya Sports College have always been talented. In the past, they have achieved excellent results representing the country in international competitions. This year is no exception. In order to prepare for winning glory, a test result meeting was held at the school yesterday afternoon, which also served as a screening for participating in the Chinese preliminary selection. From 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM, all the events were concluded. The results of each event were very excellent, which is also a considerable harvest of long-term training. It is calculated that the women's group exceeded the national record in two items: (1) Qian Hangsu's long jump of 4.92 meters, exceeding her own record of 4.88 meters; (2) Pan Yingchu's javelin of 28.95 meters, breaking Chen Rongming's record of 27.75 meters. In the men's group, the triple jump, javelin, and high jump were the best. Jia Lianren did not participate because he had to attend the Seven Nations Games today. However, it was found that he had previously achieved a result of 2 minutes 5.1 seconds in the Jiangnan Huaguang match, and it was decided to allow him to participate in the preliminary selection meeting.

<h3 id="e174">Science Lecture Competition Methods for All Levels of Schools in This City: City Education Bureau Formulates and Announces Three Types <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau issued an order to its affiliated schools at all levels, stating: "The Ministry of Education's order Gao Zong Yi Er No. 02272 stated: 'According to the report from the China Scientific Movement Association, scientific knowledge is closely related to national economy and people's livelihood, and the level of scientific knowledge among the general public in our country is particularly low. Fortunately, thanks to your ministry's painstaking efforts, science education in schools at all levels has gradually been brought on track in recent years. Considering the current situation, with rural areas bankrupt and the national situation in peril, teachers and students in schools can still study diligently. The knowledge of teachers and students is cultivated by the blood and sweat of their fathers and brothers and the nation. How can they turn a blind eye to the poverty of the people and the weakness of the nation? Furthermore, if the lives of the Chinese people are not scientificized and production is not changed, the general public will lose their ability to participate in the work of solving national crises and reviving the nation. In the current difficult times, school faculty and students should use their scientific knowledge in their spare time to popularize it among the public, so that schools and society are closely related, and people's lives can be improved. Our association is concerned about this and has spared no effort in promoting the scientificization of Chinese society from the beginning. However, due to our limited resources, it is difficult to achieve significant results. Now that the spring semester is beginning, we propose to order all levels of schools across the country to hold at least one public science lecture per month. Primary and secondary schools must also hold science lecture competitions every semester, and welcome the general public to attend, in order to improve the scientific knowledge of the public.' Upon receipt of the ministry's notification, which stated that 'the association's request is feasible and should be followed,' this bureau will formulate the 'Methods for Holding Public Science Lectures in Schools at All Levels in Shanghai' and the 'Methods for Holding Science Lecture Competitions in Primary and Secondary Schools in Shanghai,' so that the schools can follow them. In order to increase the interest of primary and secondary school students in science lectures, we have also formulated the 'Methods for the Shanghai Science Lecture Competition for Primary and Secondary Schools' as a basis for holding citywide competitions in the future. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping, we will announce the formulated methods in advance so that all schools are aware of them and implement them accordingly, reporting back for review. Do not neglect this matter.'"</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn, Special Edition on Strange Surnames</p>
<h3 id="e177">Let's Also Talk About Strange Surnames <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— (Qian Nantie)</p>
<p>Reading the record of strange surnames in "Spring and Autumn" these days, I can't help but feel itchy to write. I have also made some records of rare surnames. My humble work, "Liyuanlou Collection," has a volume attached called "Research on Rare Surnames," which lists hundreds of surnames. Due to space limitations, I will not list them all here. Recently, I have gained some more knowledge, and I will list a few. I wonder if you can add some more?</p>
<p>In the list of successful candidates in the Qing Dynasty, there is "Lü" Luanju in the Shunzhi period, "Mi" Xiangzhen in the Yongzheng period, "Nian" Kesheng in the Qianlong period, and "Li" Jun and "Shui" Junshao in the Guangxu period. These are probably also in the category of strange surnames. In my hometown of Changshu, there is the double surname "Yin Li." Yin Liyao, a scholar of the Guangxu period, rose from a censor to the salt and tea commissioner of Sichuan. In Guangxi, there is "Pan" Zhuqi, who once served as the director of a provincial department. It is said that the Pan surname is descended from Panhu, but I don't know if it is true.</p>
<p>In Jiangyin, there are six surnames that are descendants of Fang Xiaoru. Currently, there is "Liu" Weizhao, who works as a teacher at Zhejiang Provincial Middle School. The director of the Shanghai Star Film Company used to be "Ma Xu" Weibang. Also, the "Pu Xuefeng" mentioned by Mr. Liu is from Changshu. "Pu Xue" is a double surname. As for the Pu surname, it is common everywhere and not strange. I am just correcting this.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Three Strange Surnames <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zongheng</p>
<p>In the "Juwu Ji" written by Wei Yuan of the Qing Dynasty, there is a name "Dou Bin" because he wanted to prove that the saying "In the Guandong region, the people produce prime ministers; in the Guanxi region, the people produce generals" in the Book of Han was correct, so he cited many Qing Dynasty military generals from Shaanxi and Gansu. The note below says he was from Guyuan. Although the official position was not noted, the existence of this military general in the Qing Dynasty is probably verifiable. His surname can also be considered a strange surname.</p>
<p>Li: There were two people named Li in the early Qing Dynasty. One was Li Hanshi, and Wang Yuyang's poem "Three Worthies of Sūmén" contains the line: "Li Hanshi of Xihua, willingly poor as a scholar, serves his mother in a grass hut, fearing disgrace if he returns clean." It is singing about him. His original name was He and he was from Xihua. He was a licentiate of the Ming Dynasty. Because he was ashamed to share the same surname with the rebel Li Zicheng, he changed it to Li. The other was Li Hongchu, with the courtesy name Jiqi, from Xinghua County, Yangzhou. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, he called himself the retired monk of Mount Heng. He can also be considered a patriot of the late Ming Dynasty. He also originally had the surname Li. The reason for his surname Li is that after the Incident of Jia Shen, he wrote to his son: "Our first ancestor Jiu, was a Li official, and his descendants were named Li. Later, due to similar pronunciation, they were also named Li. Now that the late emperor died for the country and the thief is named Li, how can I bear to share the same surname with the thief? My descendants should restore the surname Li." (See Ji Qiting Collection) The two of them were "known as the two Li's in the world" at the time. Today, we record this not only because their surnames are strange, but also because their strange surnames contain patriotic elements. We especially promote this to shame those who betrayed the country.</p>
<p>Guo: Ten years ago, I knew a friend named Guo Aikui. He was from Yantai and also liked to write, but I haven't seen any of his writings in a long time. I don't know what his situation is like. I feel that his surname seems to be very rare.</p>

<p>Autumn Child</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many articles about surnames in the Spring and Autumn, which shows that studying surnames is also a very interesting thing. How can those gentlemen who advocate "abolishing surname boundaries" be compared? However, our China is so big, and the population is so large. Looking at history, there were originally more than a hundred surnames among the ancients: the "Hundred Family Surnames" in elementary school textbooks only selected some of the more common hundred. As for whether surnames are strange or not, in my personal view, there is no absolute standard. Because you think it's strange, I don't think it's a surname. I think it's strange, and he doesn't think it's strange. A surname that is rare in this place is considered very strange, but in another place it is very common and not strange. The ancient saying "less seen, more strange" is more logical! I'm going to talk about some rare surnames again. Do readers think they are very strange? Or are they "Meh, nothing special"?</p>

<p>— (Bo Shen) (Que Chou)</p>
<p>There have already been several articles discussing strange surnames; these surnames are indeed rare, and they have aroused the interest of many readers; I am also one of them; so I have collected several surnames outside the Hundred Family Surnames to contribute to the readers. Li Zhaolian, wrote a book called "Xiaoting Miscellaneous Records"; Zhan Shutang, is the current commander of the 81st Division; Tan Zixin, is the commander of the 10th Cavalry Division in Henan; Lai Siyong, is from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, and is currently in the same school as me; Jing Zhaoqian, is the current commander of the 29th Army Gendarmerie; La Qingzhang, is from Chengdu, Sichuan; You Guocai, is the current director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guizhou; Yuan Songzhou, was a member of the Jiangsu Disaster Investigation Group more than ten years ago; Da Qingbao, is from Liuhe, Jiangsu, and is also in the same school as me; Guo Hailan, is a special commissioner for banning tobacco cultivation, currently in Fujian; Cheng Guanyou, is a staff member of the Tongchang Pawnshop in Suzhou, I don't know if he is still there; Fu Zhifang, is a classmate of the author's friend, Mr. Qian.</p>

<p>— (A Corner)</p>
<p>In my hometown of Chaozhou, there are quite a few unusual surnames. In Raoping County, there's a compound surname, (Wu Xu). The famous Dr. Zhang Jingsheng's ex-wife was named Wu Xu Chunjiang, who studied at the provincial second normal school. Her relatives are numerous. Some suggest that people with the surname Wu were adopted by the Xu family, and later their surname became these two characters, Wu Xu. This cannot be definitively determined. It's probably somewhat similar to Lufei Bohong of the China Medical Bureau and Ma Xu Weibang, the movie star. In Raoping, there's also a village where everyone is surnamed (Zhan), which is also very special. In Zhanglin Town, Chenghai County, there are many overseas Chinese surnamed (Yi). In Shantou, there's a tea shop called Yi Xing Ji. This large signboard attracts a lot of attention. According to them, their ancestors were two sworn brothers who gathered clams by the sea. They added the insect radical to the character for righteousness (義) to form their own clan. This is probably just unfounded rumor. In fact, this surname does exist. I've seen it in Shanghai, but written in the ancient form 螘, it seems more elegant. In Guangzhou, there's a strange surname (　), pronounced the same as Xuan. Among the members of the Guangdong natives in Shanghai Association, there are Bu Wenze, Ying Siyou, Lao Yanlin, and a Ms. Xing Shunhua. These surnames are also rare. Also, my friend Pan Jinzhai writes the upper part of his surname Pan with the character for "rice" (米), becoming (潘), instead of the "collect" radical (采). It's said that it's a branch of the Pan surname, so he is very careful when printing business cards, insisting on lithography. Because if it's printed with lead type, a stroke would have to be removed from the cast character, which is unsightly. This is similar to the You surname in Shanghai. In the phone book, besides the You character (尤), there's also a You character with a dot less (尢), divided into three strokes and four strokes. If you don't know this, you won't be able to find Mr. You even if you search the book thoroughly. In fact, both are pronounced as You. There are the most unusual surnames in the theater world. As far as I know, there are quite a few in Beijing. For example, the leading male actors Gui Junqing, Ming Haishan, Pu Youan, Zhi Heqing, Guan Dayuan, Shi Huibao, En Xiaofeng, the young male actor De Junru, the martial actor Chi Yueting, Rui Debao, the painted-face actor Mei Ne Shaoxian, Qing Chunpu, Ju Dekui, Fu Xiaotian, the clown Ci Ruiquan, and the female lead Ru Shihui. Da Tianbei, a senior actor in Shanghai's new drama scene, is now a translator in the Hongkou police station. In Shanghai, the unusual surnames on shop signs are Ren Changtai Incense Candle Shop and Yu Zhentai Silver Shop, which everyone knows. There's a paper shop called Xing He Tai in the Nanshi area. Its owner's surname is Xing. Perhaps you haven't noticed. This can be said to be an unusual surname among the "Three Tai" in Shanghai. My friend Wang and Ren went to the Commercial Press to print business cards. Because the manuscript was written sloppily, he had the Wang character printed as Ren (壬), probably thinking it was related to Ren Yutai. Moreover, it has some connection with the Ren character in his name, so he didn't notice the mistake. Some people say: the fewer strokes a surname has, the better, like Ding and Bu. They are often listed at the top when listing names. If your surname is Yi (一), wouldn't that be great? In fact, Yi is also a surname. According to the Kangxi Dictionary, there was a Yi Xuanzong in the Ming Dynasty. Not only is there a surname with the character Yi, but there's also a surname with the character Liu (六). My friend Zhou Wenxi saw Liu Ziming on the staff attendance sheet and asked him if it was Lu or Yue, why write a different character? In fact, there was indeed this surname in the Warring States period. Another friend, Cai Jianhen, hired a wet nurse. She said her surname was Qi (懎), and he thought it was the Chang of Changzhou. I said this might be a descendant of the Qi from the Zuo Zhuan, because Qi and Qi are the same character.</p>

<p>— (Qing Qu)</p>
<p>In my Jiading city, there used to be a dim sum shop. One of its owners was surnamed (Yuan). Everyone pronounced this (Yuan) as "Gu." His shop's name was originally (Yuan De Sheng), so he was called "Gu De Sheng." Outside the West Gate, there's a paper shop that prints Buddhist images (shenmo). Its owner was surnamed (Ze), named (Huaqing), but he has now passed away. In Guangfu, there's someone surnamed (Qiang), whose nickname is (Zisheng). He runs a rice shop in Shanghai, and is the eldest manager of the Xie Chang De business. Last year, the branch director of the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau was surnamed (Bi), named (Xiuzhao). It's really rare to encounter someone surnamed (Bi). I'm afraid that apart from this branch director, you wouldn't find him anywhere else!</p>
<p>I once met a friend in Shanghai and asked his surname. He said it was (Xin). When I first heard it, I couldn't figure out the pronunciation, and thought it must be a variant of (Sun) or a mistaken form of (Xun), because he was from the north. I couldn't be sure. Later, he took out a card from his pocket, on the back of which were printed two lines of small red characters: (Shunian), styled Yougu, a successful candidate in the imperial examination from Dong'an, Shuntian). Only then did I understand that this friend was surnamed (Xin), named (Shunian), and styled (Yougu), a former scholar. Also, in the third prison of Shanxi, there was a section chief who asked someone to buy life insurance in Shanghai a few years ago. His surname was really strange, (Ti), named (Renfu). Not only was the pronunciation hard to say correctly, but when I looked it up in the dictionary, I found out his surname was (Ti), pronounced like "Ti." There was also someone surnamed (Duo) with whom I had worked. But I can't remember that friend's name anymore. He seemed to be from Yunnan, and his father, named (Ruzheng), was a successful candidate in the imperial examination in the year of Bingzi. It is rare indeed to see someone surnamed (Duo)!</p>
<p>One day, I flipped through a commemorative album of a certain company, and there were many strange surnames inside, such as (Zhi Yiqi), (Chu Buzhou), (Mou Shenxiu), (Da Yaoxian). These four surnames are also rare. Among the five elements, besides the surnames (Jin) and (Shui), I haven't seen (Mu) and (Tu). Only in the newspaper I often see Mr. (Huo Xueming) writing articles. In that case, a surname (Huo) is indeed a rare one!</p>

<p>My small dwelling is isolated from the noise, opening the window reveals the new green of the willows. I live in leisure, accompanied by flowers, and we are neighbors on fine nights.

Quick events, quick people, create quick words, good friends and good companions enjoy a drunken good time. Clear words almost make one want to repeat them three times, fine wine - why not risk drinking a hundred cups? The trees are old and the spring is deep, the poetic intent is faint, let us seek another gathering to entertain the guests.</p>

<p>— Huang Tian</p>
<p>This journal has published articles by Mr. Wan Gong and Mr. Gong Min about unusual surnames, which seem very interesting. I happen to have a yearbook of classmates at hand, so I flipped through it and found a few unusual surnames as well. Now I'll write them out to join in the fun. "La" - from Zhechuan, Henan. "Qu" - from Muping, Shandong. "Shui" - from Jiading, Jiangsu. "Zhang" - from Funing, Jiangsu. "Ju" - from Taiyu, Jiangsu. "Shi" - from Shouxian, Anhui. "Gou" - from Sichuan. "Qie" - from Sichuan. These are all very rare surnames. Especially the last two, if one Mr. Gou and another Ms. Qie were to marry, these two "honorable surnames" put together would be truly wonderful.</p>
<p>When I was in elementary school, I had a classmate whose surname was "Chi". According to a classmate from Yunnan, there used to be a division commander in Yunnan whose surname was "Na." It is said that the ancestors of this "Na" division commander were Tibetans. Nowadays, some people in Guangxi are surnamed "Ji." According to the locals in Guangxi, those with the surname "Ji" are the truly original people of Guangxi. Some people in Guangxi are also surnamed "Nong," said to be descendants of the Southern Man king Nong Zhigao.</p>
<p>Collecting strange surnames is not just an interesting thing. Every strange surname must have its origin. It's likely that there are more strange surnames in the border provinces, which is due to mixing with other ethnic groups. If the genealogy of each strange surname is studied to see its origin, it would be a very meaningful work in anthropology.</p>

<p>— Xiang Xian</p>
<p>Recently, this journal has been discussing the topic of "strange surnames" with great enthusiasm, starting with Mr. Wan, followed by Mr. Gong and Mr. Liu. I, Xiang Xian, though unworthy, also come to "attach to the tail of the horse," so to speak, to further make the event a success. I wonder if Mr. Shou Juan, the "uncrowned emperor" of the newspaper, "thinks so"? (Thank you for making me the emperor, but I'm afraid of revolution and the guillotine, so I dare not accept it, the editor jokingly notes.) I remember what I learned in my studies and the discoveries of unusual surnames among my classmates over the past ten years. So I'll write them down as follows:</p>
<p>"Qin" Qin Huali, a disciple of Mo Di, once studied under Zixia, and was mentioned alongside Mo Di. "Lie" Liezi, named Yukou, a man of Zheng, lived at the same time as Duke Mu of Zheng, and wrote eight chapters, called Liezi. "Gu" Notes from Jingzhai: "...Bu merchant Gu Ziming, strong and powerful, resisted the bandits, and was spared from the disaster." "Dian" Dian Wei, a famous general of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period, was a confidant of Cao Cao. "Guan" Guan Ying, a scholar-official of the Han Dynasty, harmed Jia Yi and lost his position as a senior official, he is the one. "Jing" Jing Cha, a Chu poet, became famous after Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River. "Lu" Lu Wenshu, a court historian of the Han Dynasty. "Xi" Xi Chang, Biographies of Immortals: "Xi Chang was a minister of Zhou... later he went to the quicksands with Lao Tzu." "E" E Lai, a minister of the Shang Dynasty, Records of the Grand Historian: "E Lai was strong and served the king with his strength." "Xian" Xian Zishuo, along with Gao He, was a tyrant of Qi, banished from his hometown, studied under Mozi, and became a famous figure in the world. "Zou" Zou Yan, Records of the Road says: "Descendants of the lesser lord of Zhu, in the Zhou Dynasty there were Zou Yan, Zou Ji, and Zou Shi, known as the Three Zous." "Zai" Analects: "Zai Wo asked about the length of the three-year mourning period." Zai Wo is also written as Zai Yu, a disciple of Confucius. "Wei" Weizi Qi, the half-brother of the Shang Dynasty tyrant Zhou, Zhou was licentious and did not listen to his advice, so he left. The Duke of Zhou advised Wu Geng to order Weizi to replace the Shang Dynasty, and he was enfeoffed in Song. "Li" Li Zhu, a man of the Yellow Emperor's time, could see the tip of an autumn hair from a hundred paces, Mencius wrote Li Lou. "Shi" Shi Kuang, a minister of Jin, could summon ghosts and spirits with his music. "Hui" Hui Shi, a debater of the Six Kingdoms period, his learning came from "separate Mo." "Ku" Ku Huo, Zhuangzi, All Under Heaven: "...The Ku Huo of the South, Ji Chi, and Dengling Zi, all recited the Mo Canon." "　"　Cuo, a man of Yingchuan in the Han Dynasty, studied the criminal law of Shen Buhai and Shang Yang. He was a tutor of the crown prince during the reign of Emperor Wen, and was favored for his eloquence. Later, when the Seven Kingdoms of Wu and Chu rebelled, Emperor Jing used Yuan Ang's words to kill Cuo in the East Market. "Pen" Pen Che, a native of Shanxi, a classmate in the past, quick-witted, but unfortunately died young. "Shan" Shan Linsheng, a farmer of my family, a native of Huaibei, many of his clan are lost. "Cui" Cui Huaren, a native of Yongning, Guangxi, also a former classmate, I don't know where he went after graduation. Recently, I read the Da Ri Bao, which published a list of lawyers in Shanghai, there is a Bian Jialu, this surname is not common. The latest famous movie star Diao Banhua, this surname is also not common. Also, in Mr. Liu's article "Talking about Surnames" on the 12th, there is an entry for the "Ling" clan, with a note: This newspaper often has a contributor called Ling Hu Zhao. According to Ling Hu Zhao is the pen name of my classmate Mr. Shen, not his real surname, and should be deleted when someone compiles a "Record of Strange Surnames" in the future.</p>
<p>I think the "strange surnames" published in the newspaper for several days in a row have research value, so I specially come to contribute a few surnames for the reference of the readers:</p>
<p>Fu (pronounced Hu Fufu Wu, a member of the Hunan Provincial Assembly in the fourth year of the Republic of China) (pronounced Chou, a large clan in Dongxiang, Hunan)</p>
<p>Tong (Tong Daoying, currently a staff member of the Guangxi Provincial Government) (pronounced Ta, unknown name, served as Deputy Salt Transport Commissioner of Huaibei in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China) (Wang Lisheng)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Finance - American silver reaches 77 cents - Margin plummets $18.10 - Dalian speculators heavily short - Creating a new low of $758.50 - Adding water becomes even more expensive - Spot prices to diverge from margin <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although foreign banks continued to soar in the silver market, the mood was still lacking in significant impact. However, due to Western merchants restricting the supply of foreign exchange, it was difficult to tighten. Furthermore, the Dalian speculators heavily shorted, creating a new low of $758.50. In the morning, with overseas foreign markets continuing to soar, but with big speculators on the ground, the market slightly sang the New York silver price has increased to 77 cents, which has reached the stipulated price. The Monterrio forward silver price soared by 3 points, and exchange rates all shrank. London bullion rose 8 and a half pence. Although the local market was stimulated, there was a lack of sellers after the dip, and the fall was not enough. The off-market pre-market opened, falling to $734. Buyers flocked in, and it rose to $80. Then large players began to sell bars, and it fell back to $734. Many people took advantage of the low price to cover their short positions, and it rose again. The Central Bank announced its listing, with both the British and American currencies rising, and the customs gold unit falling by 1.2%. The standard price of margin fell to $840.90, and then it weakened slightly. After the opening, banks tried to restrict the shilling, and the exchange rate hardened and fell, but did not break the $70 mark. Buyers took advantage of the low price to become active, gradually pushing it up. Short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and it briefly rebounded. Unfortunately, this did not last long. Jewish merchants Qiao Zhifu and Sassoon both came to restrict supply, and the exchange rate loosened and fell again. The white silver equilibrium tax remained unchanged and retreated within $70. Sassoon and Qiao Zhifu restricted again, and the domestic shilling was incredibly hard, falling to $763. Unexpectedly, both the Associated Press and Reuters reported that our ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhaoji, protested to US Secretary of State Hull about raising silver prices, which caused a brief reaction, rebounding by more than $10. However, because Sassoon was still selling foreign exchange, the domestic market was still hard, and it soon fell again. At noon, it hovered around $70. In the afternoon market, the market turned from flat to weak, falling within the $70 mark. Selling pressure increased sharply and it fell. Indian silver was reported to have risen 45 annas, once approaching the $60 mark. The exchange market was normal, and there was no shortage of short covering after the fall, so there were repeated rebounds. Indian silver rose again by 9 annas for the second time. Although there was downstream, it soon stabilized, because Reuters reported that the Indian silver market had stopped new transactions and was only allowed to settle. However, the Dalian speculators worked hard to dump, finally breaking the $60 mark and falling to a new price of $758.50. Finally, Indian silver contracted back by 9 annas for the third time, and buyers were strong again. The exchange rate also improved because of some telephone purchases from Bombay, and the situation improved. Finally, it presented a hovering situation. Spot prices will diverge from margin, and adding water will become even more expensive. The spot market posted $9 premium due to short covering. After today's market situation is recorded.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at $775.50, down $7.50 from the previous close. Short covering came in, and it rose from $5 to $7. McCallum and others restricted the June shilling at 1.25. Hui Xiang, Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Ying Xiang, Wan Feng, Yi Cheng, and Shun Li all sold bars, gradually going downstream. The exchange rate was also hard, and the July shilling at 8 pence also fell to $70.02 because there was no demand. Qian Chang Xiang and Heng Yu even advanced to $2, but McCallum restricted the June shilling at 1.25, and Wan Xing and Shun Li sold bars, and it fell to $70. The Shanghai Pa 4 month US dollar at 625, Heng Yu, Shen Da, Yong Hui Xiang, Fu Xing, and Yong took advantage of the low price to advance to $6. Qian Chang Xiang and Yuan Chang Yong unloaded, and it fell to $3. It was learned that HSBC Bank posted a rate of 25 for British and 4375 for US. Heng Yu, Hong Kang, Yong Yuan Heng, Tong Yu Run, Shun Mao, and Ri Chang advanced, and the HSBC Pa 5 month shilling 125 rose to $7. Chang Da, Yu Qing, Yong Fu Yu, and Yi Cheng took advantage of the high price to sell bars, falling to $4.50. Ri Chang and Heng Xing even advanced to $6.40. Qiao Zhifu was willing to restrict the June shilling at 1.25, and Heng Yu and Hui Xiang unloaded, falling to $3. Heng Xing, Shen Kang, Yu Qing, Yong Da Da, and others came to cover their positions, rising to $7.70. McCallum came out at half a dollar for June and still weakened. Later, because Sassoon came out with the June shilling at 1.25, Da Fa, Yong Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Yuan Yi, Chang Da, Hui Xiang, Fu Yu, Ding Kang, Yi Cheng, Wan Yu, Tong Yu Run, Heng Xing, and Sheng Da all sold, and the white silver equilibrium tax did not move, falling to $65.80. Da De Cheng and Heng Yu took advantage of the low price to maintain it, rising to $8. Hui Xiang, Yi Feng, Yong Yuan, Kang Xiang, and retail investors all sold, and it fell to $3. Sassoon and Qiao Zhifu have restricted the June shilling at 3125. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yuan Chang Yong, and others all advanced, gradually pulling it up. The Associated Press and Reuters both reported that our country protested to the US government about the silver policy, and the mood was boosted, rebounding to $75. But the exchange market was normal. Qian Chang Xiang, Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, Hui Xiang, Da Sheng, and others all came to supply bars, falling to $66.50. Yi Feng and Yong Heng Yu advanced to $9.50. Sassoon restricted the June shilling at 3125 again, and Dalian speculators and Yuan Mao Yong and others sold, and it fell to $5.60 again.

After maneuvering, the noon closing was at $771.20, and after the closing, it weakened slightly, falling to around $70.</p>
<p>The opening price in the later market was $770.70, then $1. Shun Li, Ying Xiang, Tong Yu Run, Yi Cheng, and Da De Cheng sold to $66.50. Heng Yu and Xiang He took advantage of the low price to advance to $8.20. Chang Da, Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Ri Chang, Yu Qing, and Yong Lai sold, falling to $4. It was mistakenly reported that Indian silver only rose 4.5 annas, and Wan Feng, Heng Yu, and Hui Xiang advanced to $6.70. In fact, Indian silver rose 45.42 annas. The selling wind finally intensified, and Wan Xing and Da Fa Yong Yi Cheng sold to 05 corners. Da De Cheng, Sheng Da, Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, and others took advantage of the low price to cover their positions, because the exchange market was normal. It rose to $6.20. Han Heng and Fu Yu took advantage of the high price to sell, falling to $4. McCallum Pa's July US dollar was 6875, and Heng Yu and Yi Yu advanced to $7. Wan Dian, Yuan Chang, Yong Sheng Da, Cong Xiang, and Yi Cheng all came to sell bars, falling to $1.10. Heng Yu and Hui Xiang advanced bars, rising to $3.80. Indian silver rose again by 12 annas for the second time, and Yuan Yi and Da De Cheng sold, falling to $1.50. However, because the Bombay silver market reported that there were restrictions on new transactions in the Indian silver market, only settlement was allowed. Fu Yu, Fu Xing Yong, and Han Heng covered their positions, rising to $4. Sassoon restricted Yi Feng, Yong Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, Wan Yu Fu Sheng Yong Yi Cheng, and retail investors competed to sell, falling to a new low of $758.50. Soon, Indian silver contracted back by 9.8.8 annas for the third time. Yu Qing, Yong Da Fa, Yong Hui Xiang, Heng Yu, Wan Xing Yuan Yi, and others came to buy, rebounding to $65.

<h3 id="e188">Western Merchants Dumping, Exchange Market Trend Tightening <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London large bars rose two pence and six two five points at near and far terms. The large bar's foothold softened slightly after the market closed. New York silver market rose five and three seven five points. The forward silver price in Montreux also rose by more than three points. London raw gold rose eight pence. British currency against the U.S. dollar narrowed by three seven five points. U.S. dollar against British currency narrowed by seven five points. British currency against French currency rose thirteen pounds. U.S. dollar against French currency rose one two five points. The exchange market opened in the morning with a selling price of one shilling and eight pence and one five six two five points for the near term British currency, and forty yuan and five six two five points for the U.S. dollar. Compared with the previous closing, the British currency was soft by one eight seven five points and the U.S. dollar was strong by three one two five points. After the opening, the psychology of Chinese merchants was still good and extremely level. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed a rise of two five points for the British currency and a rise of four three seven five points for the U.S. dollar. The customs gold unit fell by one point and two li. Banks seized the opportunity to dump heavily, suddenly turning to loose silver operations. However, banks were still scooping up while it was cheap, and there was still room for maneuvering. It was known in advance that HSBC's official exchange rate would rise by two five points for the British currency and increase by four three seven five points for the U.S. dollar, and then loosen again. Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and British merchant Sassoon both had supplies, so the process repeatedly tightened. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, and it loosened further. Later, due to news from the Associated Press and Reuters that our country's minister Shi Zhaoji was protesting the silver policy to the U.S. government, it briefly tightened, but soon loosened again, mainly because Sassoon came to sell again. However, due to the banks still scooping up, there was much maneuvering. The future market reported a rise of forty-five anna for Indian silver, and it softened slightly. Banks were trading against each other. Although Indian silver rose twelve anna twice, it remained level due to restrictions on new transactions. Sassoon sold slightly. Although it hardened slightly after entering the market, the purchase of shillings by telegraph from Bombay did not undergo any major changes. At the closing, the selling price for the near term was one shilling and eight pence and four three seven five points and half a penny for a搭. The U.S. dollar was forty-one yuan and one eight seven five points. Compared with the previous closing, the British currency was soft by half a penny and the U.S. dollar was strong by nine three seven five points. Chinese merchants dumped slightly, while the Dalian gang scooped up U.S. dollars. Sassoon dumped approximately two hundred thousand pounds in shillings, and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu also dumped. The market conditions for today will be recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Call Loan Interest Rates Still Rising Daily <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the market, the Chinese and foreign sectors were quite active due to the relationship at the end of the month, and trading was also brisk, so the market was unusually firm. Not only was there no downward trend, but it continued to rise compared to the previous market. The call loan interest rate for foreign firms was one jiao and five fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, three fen better than the previous market. As for overnight loans, the opening rate was still two jiao, but it rose to two jiao and five fen because there were slightly more seekers. Later, the market ultimately allocated overnight loans to sufficiently meet the demand, and the rate fell slightly to one jiao and five fen, a decrease of five fen compared to the previous market. In terms of call loan transactions, over 4.2 million was transferred in the morning market, with over 600,000 in new transactions. Over 200,000 was transacted in the afternoon market. Over 500,000 was transacted in the Small General Association. In terms of foreign pawned goods transactions, over 1.1 million was redeemed and over 1.9 million in new transactions were made.

<p>Yesterday, the morning and afternoon markets for Jiangnan small silver dollars opened at 836 yuan, the same as the previous market. No transactions were made in the morning or afternoon markets. Guangdong small silver dollars rose by 5 jiao in the morning market to 732 yuan and 9 jiao, and fell back by 1 jiao in the afternoon market to 732 yuan and 8 jiao, resulting in a slight improvement of 4 jiao compared to the previous market. Transactions made were 110,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 336,000 wen, 1,000 wen shorter than the previous day.

<h3 id="e190">Securities: Securities Delivery All for Major Players <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, April 26, was the delivery date for April futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The market was closed for the day as usual. The most noteworthy aspect of this delivery situation was that the delivery side was mostly large players, such as Nos. 54, 58, 1, and 16, all of whom were delivering. The largest quantity was delivered by No. 54. The receiving side was mostly small retail investors. It appears that physical goods are gradually flowing out of the financial sector and being dispersed among various retail investors. The total delivery volume was 34.16 million, of which 21.89 million was settled independently by brokers through account transfers, and 12.27 million was settled at the exchange. Among these, 22 Customs bonds accounted for 5.8 million and 96 bonds accounted for 3.43 million, the largest amounts. From this, it can be seen that after 22 Customs bonds allowed the exchange of ten-thousand-yuan notes for thousand-yuan notes, the circulation volume suddenly increased, and the market price discount was also the lowest. As for 96 bonds, due to the general public's speculative fervor, rumors fluctuated from time to time, and the market price rose and fell rapidly. Other varieties were quite stable, with the difference between the highest and lowest prices only about two or three yuan. 23 Customs bonds have been declining since the previous surge. Throughout April, they did not show any signs of recovery, and trading gradually became quiet. The situation was dominated by rumors, with very few facts. The additional issuance of 100 million in financial public bonds and the exchange of ten-thousand-yuan notes for thousand-yuan notes for 22 Customs bonds were sufficient to increase the number of chips in the market. The repeated surges in U.S. silver prices, the bankruptcies of Yongxing and Tongtai money shops, and the difficulty of borrowing at the end of the month were sufficient to stir up unease in the market. Although the control of finance and currency inflation are still just rumors, people are already apprehensive. For example, deposits have been transferred from Chinese merchants banks to foreign banks, which has become a reality. The tight money supply and increased call loan rates are all manifestations of insufficient cash flow. Rumors do not cease, people's hearts are difficult to settle, and the future is not optimistic. The rumors about 96 bonds are particularly confusing and disorienting. The so-called consolidation is nothing more than a mirage. The delivery settlement and total transaction volumes are listed separately below (unit: hundred yuan).</p>

<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (25th), the New York stock market rose, and silver stocks were particularly strong. Some varieties surged by as much as eight yuan, because New York silver prices soared to seven jiao and seven fen, which is equal to the price after the U.S. Treasury Department removed the handling fee. The public's enthusiastic buying is the result. It is expected that the Treasury Department will be forced to raise silver prices again. Demand for high-end industrial stocks was quite strong today, and the bond market was also strong. Small exchange stocks rose slightly in mixed trading, but mining stocks were very strong. The total trading volume for the day was 1.6 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the downward trend is extremely strong. The recent situation is particularly weak. According to market reports, Mr. So-and-so, a core figure among the bulls, was extremely dissatisfied with the consistent delivery of goods by inland factories in the middle of last month, so he settled all of his large holdings. Another piece of news is that there are rumors of deliveries in the near future, so the May and June futures are even more weak, falling by as much as two yuan.</p>
<p>Unstable Futures Yarn</p>
<p>In the pre-market opening for standard yarn, prices for all months showed a downward trend. Due to the soaring prices of U.S. and British silver, people were panicked, and it seemed that there was news of deliveries by a certain bull in the near term. Therefore, there was a slight increase in the number of sellers in the market. As a result, each month fell by seven, eight, and nine jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. However, Changfeng continued to cover short positions, and Jinchang added to its long positions. The market situation became even weaker after the afternoon opening, and the May futures were even more panicked, breaking through the six-yuan mark. Jinchang continued to advance, but the market was unusually loose, because the gold and silver trends were still turbulent. The general retail investors scrambled to sell short, and the market continued to decline. As a result, each month fell by another four, eight, nine jiao to one yuan and one jiao compared to the morning closing price. The sales included 550 bales from Jifeng, 750 bales from Daji, 1,300 bales from Dafu, 700 bales from Zhenda, 600 bales from Tongxing, 600 bales from Yida, 650 bales from Yuanyi, 600 bales from Yichang, 1,150 bales from Dafeng, 750 bales from Shengyuan, 500 bales from Xinchang, 650 bales from Maojin Yida, 3,850 bales from Jinchang, 650 bales from Hexing, 1,500 bales from Changfeng, 600 bales from Run Kang, 550 bales from Shenchang, and 600 bales from Taichang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Account Balance from Previous Day</p>
<p>May Futures 177.2 175.8 175.8 Down 2.00 40,550</p>

<p>September Futures 179.5 178.5 178.5 1.60 195,500</p>
<p>Total (19),350</p>
<p>Spot Sales Increase</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were higher than before. According to statistics, all gangs bought a total of 1,387 bales of spot and futures goods throughout the day. The market conditions were similar to before. The purchase amounts for each gang were as follows: 465 from Guangdong, 35 from Shantou, 10 from Tonghang, 3 from Ningbo, 20 from Changsha, 623 from inland areas, 200 from Yunnan, 10 from Henan, 5 from Xuzhou, and 10 from the Northern gang.</p>
<p>The cotton market fell sharply due to the soaring overseas silver prices and the shocking rise. However, U.S. cotton prices were not very high, and the calculated price of foreign goods became increasingly cheap. As a result, people became lazy, but new sellers in the market were not enthusiastic, so the market could still support itself.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Declines</p>
<p>In the pre-market opening for standard cotton, the market prices for each month were still level. Because a certain party had scooped up a large number of short positions the previous day, the market was tight, so the prices did not show a very obvious weakness. As a result, each month fell by one and a half to two and a half jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market suddenly loosened after the afternoon opening, and the selling wind suddenly prevailed. It was widely believed in the market that there was still a very large rise in silver prices and that the cotton market would fall. Because the calculated price of foreign cotton was trending downward, and at the same time, it was heard that standard gold was falling, general speculators unanimously tended to sell off, and the market fell. As a result, each month fell by another two and a half to three jiao compared to the morning closing price. The sales included 1,200 dan from Yuda, 3,300 dan from Yichang, 1,300 dan from Xiecheng, 1,300 dan from Yikang, 2,800 dan from Yukang, 1,200 dan from Dafeng, 3,100 dan from Gengfeng, 1,100 dan from Changyu, 3,500 dan from Changfeng, and 2,900 dan from Yuanxingchang. The purchases included 3,200 dan from Changhe, 1,300 dan from Yifeng, 2,800 dan from Hexing, 1,300 dan from Taichang, 4,000 dan from Run Kang, 1,000 dan from Dafu, 1,100 dan from Tongji, 1,100 dan from Suilong, 2,300 dan from Yuanda, and 1,100 dan from Jinchang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Account Balance</p>
<p>May Futures 33.75 33.40 33.40 Down 0.55 151,100</p>
<p>June Futures 34.05 33.70 33.70 0.55 195,700</p>

<p>August Futures 34.65 34.35 34.35 0.40 134,300</p>
<p>Total 699,700</p>
<p>Spot Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is depressed, and factory demand has turned quiet. Haitidi Tip 41.65 Shenxin Factory bought 200 bales of spot goods to the factory. Huoji flower from U.S. cotton 41.15 Shenxin Factory bought 300 bales of spot goods to the factory. U.S. cotton Si Qu Lin 48.00 Yong'an Factory bought 2,000 bales of spot goods for delivery at the warehouse.</p>
<h3 id="e193">U.S. Spot Cotton Has Reached Two Jiao <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened, with each month rising by eleven to fifteen points. Because the delivery notice for May old cotton was only 3,500 bales, they were all absorbed by large spot traders. At the same time, according to news from the Commercial News Agency, 75,000 bales of stored cotton have been delivered to New England factories, and it is planned to transfer July cotton, so it is very strong. New cotton was firm and high due to short covering, increased silver prices, and fewer sellers. The stock market was strong and also formed a firm rise. Spot traders, Japanese traders, and sellers all bought in. Later, some bulls settled, and it softened slightly. The closing was firm. It is estimated that spot goods rose by 20 points, and futures rose by 16 to 28 points. British spot cotton fell one point, and futures rose six or seven points. Indian cotton was weak at first due to bull liquidation, but then recovered due to strong buying. Finally, it fell again due to poor news from Liverpool. As a result, Ping Guoer fell by 0.25 rupee, Om La fell by 0.25 to 0.75 rupee, and Bai Luo Xi rose or fell by 0.25 to half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 25th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Xi flower for July and August on the 26th is 235.5 rupees, an increase of 2.25 rupees from the previous day's closing.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, was uniformly level and weak in all months. Foreign wheat quotations showed a decline of about two to three jiao in Chicago, and an increase of about four points in Canada. After the prices were opened, the current month was initially stable because it was the last day. However, because the receiving side was very unenthusiastic, and various factories had accumulated foreign wheat, the demand for domestic wheat was noncommittal. Once the situation changed, the market atmosphere was difficult to maintain. As for the distant months, they were initially stable, but later became weak due to the lack of buyers. The subsequent market was also weak because of good weather and a weak flour market. People unanimously looked weak, and the bidding loosened. According to industry insiders, if there is no change in the weather, a continued decline is expected. As a result, the current month fell by four fen, July and August fell by four fen, and September fell by six fen. The spot wheat market has reached a conclusion. The opening price was similar to the previous day. Yingzhou Bengbu wheat was 3.95 yuan, Shandong wheat was 3.96 yuan, Jiangbei wheat was 3.9 yuan, Luohe wheat was 3.878 yuan, Liuhe wheat was 3.87 yuan, and Hankou wheat was 3.71 yuan. 7,000 bags were shipped from Fufeng, and 3,500 bags were shipped from Fuxin.</p>
<p>Spring-ripened wheat produced in Henan and Hubei provinces has gradually entered the market. Over the past two weeks, it has been continuously transported to Shanghai via Hankou. Yesterday, 1,000 bags of wheat from Yichang arrived by Yangtze River steamer, and over 9,000 bags of wheat arrived from Hankou. Large quantities are expected to continue to arrive in the future.</p>
<p>The weakness of wheat in New York today (25th) is largely due to the progress made in crop prospects and the settlement of floating longs in May. The prices for near and far terms are becoming closer. The situation in the southwest and Kansas is still troubling. Because the current situation of spot goods is very strong, the possibility of foreign imports is temporarily being put out of people's minds.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Term Flour Near Stable, Far Decline Situation <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed a near-stable and far-declining trend in all months. Foreign wheat quotations showed a decline of about two to three jiao in Chicago, and an increase of about four points in Canada. When the prices were opened, the current month initially fell slightly to 4 jiao and 3 fen due to the return of non-industry longs, but then the customer gangs held firm. As for the distant months, they were initially stable, but then the inland gangs did not move, and the weather was clear and good, so people inside and outside the industry were uniformly level and weak. The opening price gradually fell into a downward trend. When the afternoon opening came, the current month became tight because customers were trading but not releasing. The distant months from June onward were still soft, because once the weather is good, the wheat harvest approaches step by step. Although it is not yet possible to determine how the annual harvest will be, the activity of people's hearts during the new wheat season is inevitable. Therefore, the opening price was loose and uncertain. As a result, the current month was unchanged, May improved by 2.5 li, June fell by 1.25 fen, July fell by 1.75 fen, August fell by 1.25 fen, and September fell by 1.75 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Rice Prices Slightly Reduced for Several Days <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign rice market, the morning inherited the weak trend of the previous day. Cargo owners and hoarders all sought to sell. Although the inland demand was strong, they took advantage of the situation to hold firm, and the prices of all grades uniformly trended lower, falling by three to five fen to one jiao. After the market price fell slightly, inland sales revived, and the market stabilized. A total of 10,000 bags of various types of rice were opened throughout the day, and 700 tons of futures. This street opened 1,600 bags of Saigon No. 1 and 1,500 bags of No. 3. The market is still in a level position in the future. A turning point can only occur if inland areas and customer gangs become prosperous again. The bottom stock of customer glutinous rice is gradually decreasing. After the recent fall in foreign rice prices, the market has also become slightly smaller. However, because cargo owners have high costs and little stock, they are unwilling to sell cheaply, so the market has become stagnant.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of Japonica rice in Shanghai South was slightly scarce, with only about 26 or 27 shipments arriving (a total of more than 5,000 piculs of goods). After the market on this street fell sharply the previous day, the market on this street stirred slightly yesterday. However, the sales volume was only about 500 bags handled by the Weihaiwei gang, so although the market color turned upward, it was actually only a level situation. The prices of various thick japonica and thin japonica rice were all unremarkable. Considering the future trend of the market, it is only half level. Unless the source continues to be scarce, there may be hope for an upward trend. Otherwise, there are no fluctuations in other cloudy and variable prices. The source of various sources of supplies from the Shanghai North River and downstream sources was thought of. The market sales of various goods were flat in the morning. The price of white japonica rice was reduced by a jiao, and the evening market had a slightly better outlet. The market price turned level. In addition to the small reduction in the price of early thin japonica rice, white yuan rice was shorter by one or two jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Soybean Price Increases, Transactions Become Scarce <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market situation saw that the sales market was still acceptable the previous day, which led to the sales price shouting merchants. However, when the price was high, the sales outlet did not move, so the market was very deserted throughout the day. Given the current market atmosphere is so deteriorated, the future is really difficult to look good. Yesterday, it was estimated that 150 bags of Andong beans were opened at a price of 4.92 yuan, more than 100 bags of Sipingjie beans at a price of 4.4 yuan, more than 200 bags of Hankou Zha beans at a price of 3.81 yuan, more than 240 bags of Hankou Chi beans at a price of 3.7 jiao and 5 jiao 9. There were also 20 bags of Hankou special large-grain ditch beans at a price of 4.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Rural Areas Cannot Afford to Raise Pigs and Ducks, Bran Sales Greatly Diminished <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the bran market has fallen again, and it has fallen by a jiao compared to the price at the beginning of the week. The reason for the decline is nothing more than the difficulty of matching production and consumption. In the inland areas, most of it is used as feed for raising pigs, and the sales market for those raising ducks is also quite strong. At present, the price of this item is falling, making it almost unprofitable. Therefore, the number of farmers in the inland areas is either decreasing or bankrupt, which is one reason for the decrease in sales. As for foreign countries, only Dongzhuang Road is available, but unexpectedly, it has also stagnated. There are very few inquiries, so it is going downhill step by step, with a downward trend. It is heard that yesterday the price of bran in each market was as low as 2.28 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a further drop in Customs Gold, reaching a new low, with the smallest transaction at 1.648. Consequently, foreign sugar trends weakened and continued to decline. The guild's quotation for 24th grade raw white sugar was 17 yuan, down another two cents, while re-export goods were quoted at 5.5 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Taikoo Sugar B-mark was quoted at 17.5 yuan, but also lacked buyers. The Sugar Industry Cooperative auctioned a batch of Guangdong raw white sugar, with high-quality sugar selling for 17 yuan, only 20 bags transacted. Slightly inferior sugar sold for 16.9 yuan, with no transactions. Futures market saw Dachang offering 3,000 bags of Dutch Group White sugar, expected to arrive on May 1st, at a price of 3.13 Dutch guilders, including the new foreign tax, which was two cents lower than before (24th). Chaoqing sugar prices were expected to rise because the Swatow exchange rate saw a further contraction yesterday, with previous market rates dropping from 1,020 yuan to over 1,030 yuan and yesterday's rate dropping to (1,015 yuan. Based on Swatow market lift prices, the price for Zhuangqing should be around 11.7 yuan. Quotations naturally looked upwards. However, Shanghai's sales were not strong, and dealers were observing the market and unwilling to raise prices to continue trading. As a result, transactions remained limited.</p>

<p>Recently, raw peanuts have been weak due to the sluggish Qingdao market and weak Shanghai sales. The market is currently soft. In the past two days, Guangdong merchants have slightly increased their purchases. It is estimated that 60 tons of Dangshan peanuts were traded at 6 yuan, 60 bags of Kaifeng peanuts at 7 yuan, one truckload of Tancheng peanuts at 6.9 yuan, and one truckload of Guide peanuts at 6.2 yuan. Other transactions are being negotiated but have not yet been finalized.</p>

<p>Qiongzhou red oxhide prices have recently seen a slight easing of local prices. However, the depreciation of exchange rates makes it difficult to reconcile prices, resulting in a long-term lack of arrivals. The supply of goods is extremely scarce, leading to persistent high prices with no intention of reducing them. However, dealers find the turnover slow and intend to wait for price reductions before continuing purchases. The situation is currently in a stalemate, resulting in limited transactions. Yesterday's market saw top-grade Sha red hide (weighing 100 catties per day) at 64 yuan, red water blue at 44 yuan to 41.1 yuan, white water blue thin hide at 54 yuan, and thick hide at 46 yuan. As for green hide, local factory prices are more favorable, with the top grade at 55 yuan per 100 pounds and the second grade at 51.2 yuan. Therefore, it is difficult for goods from other ports to match prices, and there has been no continued production and shipment to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Shortwave Components <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Shengshi</p>
<p>(1) General Remarks</p>
<p>The success of a shortwave radio often depends on the quality and effectiveness of its components. Some components that are very suitable for broadcast radios cannot be used for shortwave reception. This article does not discuss the design of shortwave radios or their components, but hopes to provide some help to readers when choosing components.</p>
<p>Figure 1A is a very common parallel resonant circuit in radios. At first glance, the circuit seems simple, with only an inductance L and a capacitance C. However, upon closer examination, it is not so simple. At resonance, the impedance of L is 2πfL, and the capacitive impedance of C is 1/(2πfC), which are balanced. At this time, the current in the circuit can be obtained by Ohm's law, just as in a DC circuit:</p>
<p>In a parallel circuit, R represents the equivalent ohmic resistance applied to the circuit (Figure 1B).</p>
<p>We know that the current is maximum at resonance. If we multiply it by the impedance of L or C, we get the voltage between terminals A and B in the figure, which is input to the vacuum tube. However, in reality, the coil and capacitor have losses, so R cannot be ignored. Any current flowing through R results in energy loss. The purpose of shortwave components is to minimize this equivalent resistance, in other words, to reduce the loss of this circuit.</p>
<p>The voltage amplification factor of this resonant circuit is often equal to the ratio of the coil impedance 2πfL to the resistance R. Therefore, the smaller R is, the greater the amplification factor. However, it must be noted that the value of R varies with frequency and is not constant. Therefore, in practice, the same amplification factor cannot be obtained for many different frequencies.</p>
<p>(2) Reducing Dielectric Loss</p>
<p>High-efficiency shortwave coils can be made smaller to limit the external electric field. The support for winding the coil must be chosen with low dielectric loss.</p>
<p>The coil can be wound on a ribbed support to keep the wire as far away from the support as possible.</p>
<p>Also, when a coil and a capacitor are connected in parallel as shown in Figure A, it is found that the resonant frequency of the circuit itself is not</p>
<p>but lower than this value. This is because the coil L is not purely inductance, but also has a small amount of capacitance. There is capacitance between each turn of the coil. Therefore, a coil actually contains many small capacitances in series, which are distributed between the conductors of the coil. Thus, at high frequencies, part of the current does not flow through the coil, but bypasses it, resulting in loss. This capacitance can be regarded as being connected in parallel with capacitor C, thus increasing its resonant wavelength. This capacitance is called the coil's self-capacitance. If its value is C1, then the true resonant frequency of this matching circuit is</p>
<p>To reduce this loss, a gap equal to several times the diameter of the conductor can be left between each turn of the coil to minimize its self-capacitance.</p>
<p>The number of turns of the grid coil should be such that it can be matched with the tuning capacitor to obtain the required waveband. If a regenerative coil is needed, then the smaller the better, so that it can just oscillate to reduce its impact on the tuning coil. In general, the regenerative coil is about half or one-third of the grid coil. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e203">A New Method for Radio Stations to Solicit Listener Opinions <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>The programs of a radio station naturally change according to the opinions of the listeners. The usual method for radio stations to solicit listener opinions is through correspondence. This method is time-consuming, and most listeners are too lazy to write letters, so the results are naturally not good. Using the telephone to solicit opinions is also inappropriate, because if all the listeners call at the same time, the radio station will not be able to cope. Therefore, wireless experts have been engaged in research to solve this difficulty, and preliminary work has now been completed.</p>
<p>One day, after a music program on American radio station WRO, the announcer reported: "Please turn on a 40-watt light bulb if you are listening to this station's programs in this city, and turn it off immediately after turning it on." A few minutes later, the announcer reported: "Please turn on a light bulb in the same way if you like this program." Finally, the announcer asked those who did not like this program to turn on a light bulb. (As shown in Figures A and B) In less than a minute, the radio station already knew that 10% of the 60,000 people in the local area were listening, and 95% of those listening at this time were satisfied with this program.</p>
<p>This new method of soliciting opinions was invented by radio expert Hopkins of New York. The principle is very simple. When thousands of listeners turn on a light bulb at the same time, the load of the power plant will naturally change greatly. This change is recorded by an "automatic recorder" (as shown in Figures C and D). The broadcasting station has a special auxiliary automatic recorder. From the size of the three changes recorded by this recorder, the radio station can calculate the answers to the above three questions, in other words, it can know the opinions of the listeners.</p>
<p>In addition, Hopkins has also designed a "wireless election recorder" to record the number of votes for or against a motion during a meeting. (Of course, it can also be used for other equivalent purposes) The principle is also very simple: a shortwave antenna is installed in front of the seats of the members; a shortwave transmitter is installed behind it to transmit radio waves; each member has a small rod with a single-turn loop coil on it and a button on the handle; when the button is pressed down, the coil becomes a closed circuit, and part of the radio waves is absorbed, and the radio waves received by the antenna in front of the seat are reduced; the amount of this reduction can be read from a specially made meter, and the number of people who oppose or support the motion can be known.</p>
<p>Radio is evolving, and new uses and new devices are discovered every day. We must work hard to study it.</p>
<p>Attached Figure A, the announcer asks questions to solicit listener opinions; B, listeners express their opinions according to the law; C, the automatic recorder in the power plant records the opinions of the listeners; D, a page of the recording, the highest peak represents the number of listeners at that time, the middle peak represents the number of people who agree, and the lowest peak represents the number of people who oppose.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Steps for Assembling a Radio for Beginners <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Xuelun</p>
<p>Beginners in assembling radios often suffer from the large number of new vacuum tube models and lack the ability to choose, resulting in unsuccessful reception. Therefore, I have written an article on the knowledge that beginners should have, which has been published in this newspaper. Due to the limited space, the circuit diagrams have not been published one by one, and I am afraid that beginners cannot fully understand them. Therefore, I will explain the expansion method and the circuit diagrams in detail again, as a reference when assembling radios.</p>
<p>When designing a radio, the first thing to solve is the power supply problem. As mentioned before, for the sake of convenience, only the 6.3-volt vacuum tube is drawn and explained. This type of vacuum tube is a car tube, which is sturdy, economical, durable, and consumes very little power. Therefore, it is suitable for both AC and DC use, which is more convenient than other types of vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>Now, assume that we are designing a radio that will be expanded to one stage of high amplification, one stage of detection, one stage of high-power low amplification, and one stage of rectification. The vacuum tubes used are No. 39 or 44 for high amplification, No. 36 or 37 for detection, No. 38 or 42 for high-power low amplification, and No. 80 for full-wave rectification. It is best to use an aluminum plate for the chassis, but dry plywood can also be used. The size of the chassis and the position of the parts are shown in Figure 1. The expansion positions for the future have been reserved one by one. It is best to purchase a double-gang variable capacitor for adjusting the frequency.</p>
<p>(1) Starting to Assemble a Single-Tube Radio</p>
<p>A single-tube radio uses a power amplifier tube for louder volume, but it is necessary to change the circuit when adding high and low amplification stages, so it is simpler to use a detector tube directly. Now, a No. 36 screen-grid tube is used for detection, and feedback is used to adjust the screen voltage to control it, so the oscillation is stable and the sensitivity is higher than that of No. 37. The wiring method is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>L uses a spider web board with an inner diameter of 1 and 1/4 inches, wound with 12 turns of No. 28 enameled wire. The starting end is grounded, that is, a solder lug is used to fix it on the screw of the spider web board, and the ending end is connected to the antenna.</p>
<p>L1 uses a spider web board of the same size as above, wound with 84 turns of the same enameled wire. The starting end is grounded as above, and the ending end is connected to the fixed plate of the variable capacitor.</p>
<p>L2 uses a spider web board of the same size as above, wound with 30 turns of the same enameled wire. The starting end is connected to the screen grid, and the ending end is connected to the high-impedance choke.</p>
<p>C a 0.00035 microfarad double-gang variable capacitor, Zhongyong No. 2221, with a slow-motion dial.</p>
<p>C1 a 0.00025 microfarad grid capacitor, produced by Zhongyong or Xinji.</p>
<p>C2 a 0.0005 microfarad bypass capacitor, produced by Xinji.</p>
<p>R 2 megohm grid leak, produced by American.</p>
<p>R1 100,000 ohm potentiometer, used to adjust the volume, must be produced by top-grade European and American manufacturers.</p>
<p>RFC 85,000 Henry high-frequency choke, produced by American or Zhongyong.</p>
<p>V a No. 36 vacuum tube, produced by Erxi'ai or Leisheng, with a five-pin lower tube socket.</p>
<p>After the parts are assembled, they can be fixed with screws according to the position in Figure 1, and then welded firmly one by one according to the circuit in Figure 2. The three spider web boards are separated by insulating paper and stacked and nailed to the bottom. If the feedback is too strong, the number of turns of L2 can be removed, and vice versa. A transformer for electric bells, a 6-volt battery, or four dry batteries can be used to supply A power. B power should first use 90V dry batteries. If this machine is assembled correctly, a 5-inch speaker can be used to listen to the central and local radio stations. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e212">Bible Sales in China Greatly Increased <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>In China, which is suffering from natural disasters, man-made calamities, internal troubles, and foreign invasions, it is unexpected that sales of the Bible have been particularly good. According to reports, the British and Foreign Bible Society reported that Bible sales in China last year were particularly good, an increase of 394,200 copies compared to 1933, with a total of 4,296,495 copies sold. From a business perspective, this cannot but be considered good news.</p>
<p>The reason why Bible sales were particularly good in China last year is that, on the one hand, it proves that the Chinese people are generally living in dire straits, with no way out. They can only use the Bible as a place of comfort and sustenance, seeking spiritual anesthesia. This may be the reason why Bible sales were particularly good in China last year. However, because Bible sales were particularly good, the Chinese people are hoping to find their ideal paradise in their minds, thus forgetting the immediate pain. This may not be very good news for the future of the Chinese nation. The Chinese nation now seems to need a tonic rather than an ideal paradise.</p>
<p>Last year, Bible sales were not only particularly good in China, but also increased in other countries. According to reports, Germany increased by 1,900 copies. This further illustrates how people in various countries, under the suffering of the current situation, hope to be able to reach their ideal paradise. However, this paradise is always difficult to reach. How do people around the world push the pain of reality out of their minds? This has become a problem.</p>
<p>The general increase in Bible sales around the world does not prove that the people of the world are making progress and their thinking is getting better, but on the contrary, it shows the suffering and decadence of the people of the world. However, can the Bible ultimately save their souls? This is hard to say. Perhaps some people are taking the flesh of Jesus as bread and the blood of Jesus as wine. We see how many people have buried themselves for this thing. The Bible is being used by some people like guns and cannons, and it has achieved some effects of world stability. Its welcome is not accidental.</p>
<p>However, a cool sedative cannot in fact heal our wounds all over our bodies. What will the result be?</p>
<h3 id="e213">At Yijiang Tower <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The official river rushes out of the city gate under the drawbridge, turns a corner, and flows to Lower Pond. Yijiang Tower is located at the intersection of the rapids. The tallest building in the entire county is built on a stone dam. However, this is not a famous scenic spot. There are only a few firewood boats coming in and out of the river. The grand name of Yijiang was only thought of one day by the old teahouse customers, and the horizontal plaque was hung up like that.</p>
<p>Every day, the people who come to the Yijiang Teahouse are some of the most important people in the county. They bring their own reclining chairs or sleeping couches, and the teapots and tea leaves are also kept by the tea masters according to their own preferences. Their arrival at the teahouse is like going to the office at a fixed time. The tea masters remember it most clearly. If there is an unexpected visitor, he can predict that a certain master will arrive in a few minutes. If a young master or lord does not come to the teahouse for two days, the tea master will pay a visit on the third morning, and in the afternoon he will report the results of his investigation to the other lords. It is natural that ordinary people cannot be competent in this skill of the tea master. He was a follower of a county magistrate during the Qing Dynasty, and now he is over fifty years old. It is said that he spent a considerable amount of money to take over the stove of Yijiang Tower, so in addition to pleasing those lords, he also has amazing money-making skills.</p>
<p>Every spring, when the lords' gambling interest declines, probably after the Lantern Festival, Yijiang Tower always has new tricks brought in from the small pier, such as improved Shanghai opera, Suzhou opera, or female storytelling, to add to the lords' high spirits when they are interested. As for the authorities who maintain morality, the lords have already taken care of them. Every night, the electric lights on the floor are bright, there are sharp, delicate voices singing, and there are loud voices laughing. Several black-clothed policemen dragging batons appear next to the stairs, drinking free fragrant tea leaves, and when they hear something they like, they cannot help but laugh loudly, forgetting their own duties completely.</p>
<p>This year, the gambling game unexpectedly extended to the middle of February. Although the commission is also a considerable amount of money, the tea master tries every day to stop the gambling game, as he has arranged a very profitable trick. He discussed it with the most powerful lord, and the next day he started talking. He said that the daughter of Hua Xiaorong, who had been here before, has now grown up to be even more beautiful. He said that his wife saw her at some pier. He said that the teahouse prevents later listeners from entering every day. He said that Hua Xiaorong wants to come to the local area again. He said, do you lords like to listen?</p>
<p>Sure enough, this news aroused great attention from the lords in the game. They remembered Hua Xiaorong's smile. At that time, her child was only ten years old, more beautiful than her mother. Some calculated how old this child should be. The card game naturally stopped invisibly. Everyone went back to their recliners and pondered their own plans. The old looked at the young with jealous eyes, and the young looked at the old with jealous eyes. They all wanted to take that girl into their hands.</p>
<p>Although in the temporarily quiet air, a lustful atmosphere more lively than the card game can be estimated in every restless heart. Finally, the lords with whom the tea master had previously discussed naturally spoke.</p>
<p>"Is it the child called Hua Xiaoxiang?"</p>
<p>The tone was so weak, as if he didn't care about this matter. The tea master had already put on a smiling face and deliberately lowered his voice to say softly: "Yes! That little girl really has something, much more beautiful than her mother!"</p>
<p>The long trailing sound was sent into the two ears of every lord from the air. Their hearts were burning hot, but no one wanted to agree first.</p>
<p>"Are you still interested in gambling?" Still weakly, but without waiting for anyone to answer, he said again, "That's good too, let's change the taste."</p>
<p>"Yes!" the tea master shouted.</p>

<p>"Mom, Ah Hua in Flower Lane, she scolded me: 'Your dad is a bad person, a poor bum, he doesn't have money to buy you a toy train!' Mom, is dad really a bad person? Why doesn't he bring me a toy train from 'Fanbang' that is bigger and better-looking than Ah Hua's?"</p>
<p>Ah Yin, the eldest daughter of Shou Xingge, is about seven years old. Her cheeks are as red as the Guan Lord in the Guan Emperor Temple. Panting, she came from Flower Lane all the way to the pigsty behind the house, with two strings of tears hanging from the corners of her eyes. She can't stand Ah Hua's ridicule. In her eyes, she feels that Ah Hua is now very proud, with a novel and fun toy train. However, Ah Hua's dad and her dad are both "Fan Keq," so why doesn't dad bring her a toy train that is bigger and better-looking than Ah Hua's? This question keeps spinning in Ah Yin's childish heart. She pulls on the corner of her mother's clothes and complains repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Damn debtor, you're not young anymore, and you're still pestering me here. You don't have a dad, he's already dead… Go! Drive the ducks to the back pond to take a bath." The pigs in Mom's pigsty are so full that they are a little lazy. She puts down the bamboo ladle in her hand, turns her head, and points her heavy fingers hatefully on the top of Ah Yin's head. Her voice is like a broken bronze gong. Ah Yin cries out with a "wah" sound, and then her shadow disappears behind the house.</p>
<p>Whenever Ah Yin's dad is mentioned, Shou Xing's wife gets a little angry. She tightly resents Shou Xingge's ruthlessness. He has been "abroad" for seven or eight years, without sending a single letter home, let alone money. He left her and her daughter suffering at home. She always complains about her bitter fate, marrying an unenterprising husband, which has confined her at home for her whole life, suffering and letting her youth slip away. However, last month, the "water passenger" Ma Pi Lao Er from the village ran to her house to tell her that Shou Xingge had decided to take the next ship back to Tangshan. This sudden news unexpectedly made Shou Xing's wife feel infinitely happy. The dimples that she had not seen for a long time, which had died away, reappeared on her dark, thin face full of deep wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since Shou Xingge left her at home when Ah Yin was in her belly, he packed his simple luggage and went abroad. When he left, he also told her that he would soon ask the "water passenger" Ma Pi Lao Er to pick her up and take her to Fanbang to be happy. However, years had passed without any news, not even a letter of safety, as if a stone had sunk into the vast deep sea, with not a sound to be heard. This made Shou Xing's wife's heart as anxious as ants on a hot pot. She went several times to the homes of Fan Keq in the village who had just returned from Fanbang to inquire, but everyone said different things. Some said: "Shou Xingge has drifted to Bane to work as a 'piglet'!" Some said: "Shou Xingge has married a rich Fan woman and is living a happy life in Fanbang!" From then on, Shou Xing's wife guarded her daughter Ah Yin, living a gloomy and miserable life. She had no happy spring, no caring relatives. Except for her old mother, who came out of the mountains to visit them once in a long time, what accompanied them and supported them were those few pigs and a group of chickens and ducks. They were truly the most lonely and pitiful people in the world!</p>
<p>After the "water passenger" Ma Pi Lao Er came to her house to tell her the news that Shou Xingge was returning to Tangshan, she hurriedly washed the old furniture in the room, and from time to time a light smile would float on her face behind her back. Although she was still worried that Shou Xingge would bring back a beautiful and charming Fan woman to compete for her favor. However, when she thought that Shou Xingge would bring back at least a thousand or hundreds of shiny Fan Foreign coins in his suitcase this time, to relieve the years of resentment in her stomach, and let her live a comfortable life and show off her ambition in front of her relatives, it was after all beyond Shou Xing's wife's expectations. Shou Xingge still carried the simple luggage he had when he left and stepped into the house with a sick body.</p>
<p>"Why are you so embarrassed? My God!" Shou Xing's wife's dream turned into a bubble. "I am truly a bitter person!" Shou Xingge couldn't even say a word, and lay down on the newly washed bed, sighing frequently…</p>
<h3 id="e215">Random Gleanings from Late Spring <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>(The express train tightly gripped the two parallel lines of the permanent track, frantically rushing towards the endless road: racing over hills, over embankments, over fields, over graveyards and orchards, over clusters of houses filled with contemplations.</p>
<p>It was dusk. The dim sky was crowded with heavy moisture. A cloudy day! Moreover, it was the dusk of a cloudy day—the dusk of a cloudy day, when even the most active and ardent sun in the universe was as gloomy as an ancient philosopher, hiding within layers of grey clouds, contentedly following the inevitable fate of decline that the laws of nature bestowed upon its twilight years. Everything was deathly still: peach blossoms, bearing the scorch marks of autumn, coldly drifted onto the water surface. Cuckoos, absentmindedly, cried out a couple of times with their aged voices. It was all too fast! All the good, golden dream-like days had swiftly reached their end: the sun had set, and spring was also ending.</p>
<p>Moreover, this was a spring with few good days. Was it not? The entire spring had passed by in constant wind and rain; the mud on the ground, the mud in people's hearts too—some said: in this era, it is difficult to have good days? In this era, even spring is not worth pursuing or lamenting.)</p>
<p>Therefore, I attempted to quickly forget my own difficult youthful days, and the worthless, regretful mourning for the past "golden age."</p>
<p>When seeing people dissolving their proud youth in silver-toned romances, in the mesmerizing sounds of the "saxophone" in jazz music, in the great halls of learning that form the pyramid of knowledge, or in the excessive enjoyment of glamorous life, I almost began to doubt whether I myself had ever possessed the blessing of what is called youth—just like a native of the northern lands, who grew up in a rainy region, upon entering a place bathed in sunlight all year round, becomes stunned and dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Indeed, the rain and muddy gloom of the northern lands are hard to compare with the "gentle breezes and bright sunshine" of the south. Similarly, how can someone who has stumbled through a grey, windy, and difficult spring (a once-in-a-lifetime spring!) imagine the possibility of brightness in another world?</p>
<p>Is it useless to talk about regret and lament? Yes. But even those who stroll in spring, when caught in a dismal spring and their interest wanes, still regret the waste of their travel expenses. Moreover, one's own travel expenses are life—life!</p>
<p>In this world, are there not many poets and philosophers who have exhausted their efforts to explain to us the preciousness of youth? However, this is of no use to people living in another world. When a person accepts the instinct for survival bestowed by nature, and on the other hand, accepts the congenital misfortune bestowed by society, thus carrying a small soul, and beginning the long journey of their life, who can still be in the mood to chant about the spring scenery?</p>
<p>Thus, using small and feeble steps, stepping step by step through muddy roads, and using all kinds of caution and tension to gather up a scale or a claw of the opportunities for life discarded by fortunate people, a precious youth quietly slips away, like playing hide-and-seek, like a night thief.</p>
<p>Finally, accidentally looking up: the grey gate of middle age stubbornly and gloomily stands before me, and I have already walked through the wind and rain to the end of youth, having consumed those days that will never return in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Spring has already reached its twilight; thereafter, in the corridors of life, what else will I gather?…</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Grown Sparrow <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>(Now, there is no need to worry about this poor little sparrow any more. It is no longer afraid, stubborn, or hostile towards us. It obediently flutters its fragile fledgling wings, opens its small yellow beak, and swallows the food picked on the bamboo stick with a chirping sound. We are so happy that we almost want to jump for joy. This poor little life, perhaps, will grow up in this small bamboo cage, except for the physiological defects that we humans cannot provide for.)</p>
<p>Our joy is not due to chance or temporary curiosity. It was yesterday afternoon, after a gust of wind and rain, that we discovered a poor little sparrow, its water-soaked wings drooping, crouching under the fence, chirping sadly. We were immediately moved by this sound with a sense of surprise. When we reached out to catch it, a kind of fearful and angry light shot out from its small eyes, flapping its small wings and struggling. This made us hesitate for a moment and withdraw our hands. However, its ability to fly was ultimately too weak. Unwilling to watch a small life freeze and starve to death, we finally caught it and put it in a small bamboo cage.</p>
<p>It was very stubborn at first, jumping and dashing in the cage, looking very angry. When we walked away, it chirped again. We guessed it was hungry, so we picked some food on a bamboo stick and sent it to its mouth, trying to coax it to eat. But it didn't open its mouth to take it, flapping its wings and cowering in the corner of the cage, its small eyes staring blankly at us, and it stopped chirping. We tried all sorts of ways to coax it, but it didn't work. This made us very angry, so we held it in our hands and pried open its beak with one hand, stuffing the food in. Watching it try to stretch its neck as much as possible, swallowing the stuff stuck in its throat with eyes blinking, we worried that the future of this poor little life was very bleak.</p>
<p>But now, there's no need to worry. Look, it's no longer afraid, stubborn, or hostile towards us, chirping as if it sees us as its mother. Obediently fluttering its fragile wings, opening its small yellow beak, and taking the food picked on the bamboo stick with a chirping sound. When it is full, it quietly hides in its nest and dozes off; when it is hungry, it jumps out again, as if asking its mother for food.</p>
<p>We run to the fields every day to catch some small insects and then pick them one by one to feed it. We never feel bored or tedious; on the contrary, it adds a strong sense of beauty to this ordinary life. As the days go by, its feathers gradually become plump. We often let it out; it will fly from the tiles on this side to the trees outside the wall. Sometimes, it spreads its wings and lies on the tiles under the sun, blinking its eyes. That kind of leisurely expression really makes us happy and envious. As long as we whistle, it chirps and flies down again, landing on our hands or shoulders. We have never worried that it would fly away and not come back. What we worry about is not being able to catch green worms and the civet cat that is always lurking in the corner of the house.</p>
<p>As the days go by. The yellow on the little sparrow's beak has gradually faded. Sometimes we get angry at its mischievousness and cunning, hating that it is not as tame as usual, but we still don't think it will fly away and not come back. Because it still comes back to the bamboo cage at night.</p>
<p>But, this lovely little sparrow finally didn't fly back! It's been two days now. The cage is empty at night. We try whistling, although we can't see it flying out from the wall outside, shaking its tail and jumping on the tiles. However, its feathers are full, its wings are strong, and it can find fatter and more palatable green worms than we give it. It wants to use its young strength to soar in the vast and free world! It is already a grown sparrow.</p>

<p>Opening "Divorce"</p>
<p>How can there be such a bad marriage in the world? Talking about divorce makes one's heart ache. They have conflicting opinions and cannot live together. It saves them from quarreling at each other's pillows all the time. Some have arranged butterflies for love in heaven. Some rebuild their fragrant nests to gather phoenixes. Some abandon the old to cherish the new, willingly being unfaithful. Some remarry and find it difficult to hide their hair. Therefore, everyone has to negotiate. First, let's talk about the separation of swallows and sparrows. The affection is sad. The hatred is boundless. It's like a dagger stabbing the heart. They make an appointment with a lawyer to pay the fee. The beautiful flowers will never be reunited. Some still hold hands and kiss before leaving. Some have children clinging to their clothes, and their tears don't dry. Some angrily turn their heads and willingly separate forever. Some are hypocritical and still want to flatter the beauty. Let's see them seek partners to share dreams. I'm afraid they will still be the same as before.陌路萧郎休更恋. Don't love each other anymore. Hold the pipa again and hate it. Just circle the dew couples with one stroke.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Trivia about the Famous Clothes Rack, Adolphe Menjou <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Adolphe Menjou, everyone knows he is French. Of course, he speaks French better than he speaks English. But when he was at Cornell University, the French professor actually failed him twice. Isn't that strange? But there are many strange things in Menjou's life, and we will slowly tell them.</p>
<p>His father originally ran a restaurant. Although he provided his son with a university education, his son, after graduating from university (it is not known whether Adolphe Menjou is a Cornell graduate), had to seek his own livelihood. Therefore, Adolphe ran to New York in 1913. At that time, he had only seven cents in his pocket. He wanted to enter the theater world. Coincidentally, he met a driver who introduced him to a theatrical affair. This was his first stage performance, with a salary of twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents per week.</p>
<p>He worked for a week, but he never got the twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents, because the troupe disbanded.</p>
<p>Later, in New York, he met a personnel director of the Justice Film Company. He promised him a job, but the company was in Florida, in the South. So he left New York and ran to Florida. The role he was going for required wearing a tuxedo. He didn't have a tuxedo. He used to borrow a tuxedo from his father's landlord, but now there was nowhere to borrow. His father gave him a diamond ring when he turned twenty-one. He was still wearing it on his hand at the time. He took it off and pawned it for sixty-five dollars.</p>
<p>With the sixty-five dollars, he made three tuxedos, which were morning dress, full dress, and dinner dress. He rented a small room and paid a week's rent. He had only five cents left. The next day, he excitedly ran to the Justice Film Company to report. But the film was announced to be suspended!</p>
<p>The Justice Film Company was on the eleventh floor, and on the seventh floor, there was the Vance Film Company. When he took the elevator down from the eleventh floor, he saw many people gathered in front of the Fox Company through the glass window, as if they were recruiting extras. So he took the elevator down and then took the elevator back up. Sure enough, Fox Company was going to shoot a French film. He stood in line, walking up one by one. Suddenly, a young man saw Menjou and shouted from afar: "Hey! You with the mustache! You go!" This was the beginning of his opportunity, which can be said to be a coincidence.</p>
<p>In the Fox Company, although he was just an ordinary extra, the company authorities gradually got to know him. One day, the famous director Townsend called him over, gave him a script, asked him to read it, and asked him if he could play that role. Menjou said: "Can I play it? I can eat it!" In this way, he was hired, and his salary suddenly jumped from five dollars a day to seventy-five dollars a week!</p>
<p>The rest is needless to say. But now he is a big star. Another thing that can be mentioned is that he is known in Hollywood for his exquisite clothing. He has countless clothes. According to his own estimate, he has about two hundred suits, about fifty coats, and countless shirts, hats, and shoes that he never sees once a year. But when he first arrived in Hollywood, he tried many ways to get a tailor to make him four suits, and the price was paid back in installments. Now, if any tailor gets Adolphe Menjou's patronage, it is a great honor, and the price is not a concern.</p>
<p>Another thing that can be mentioned is his name. You know, Adolphe Menjou is his real name. When he first entered the film industry, many people wanted him to change his name. A big director said: "If you don't succeed, it's your name that will ruin you. That name is too heavy." Van Miller begged him to change it, telling him that no one could remember Menjou. Many people said that when they saw the word, they didn't know how to read it. He said, "Jacob Braille! That's your name, it couldn't be better.</p>
<p>But Menjou said: "Jacob Braille, let him go to hell." Now he is famous, and not only can everyone pronounce his name according to German pronunciation, but it is also known to every household, and women and children all know it.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. Adolphe Menjou is not a extravagant person. He is known for his clothing, which is his way to fame, and a business strategy that must be maintained. He himself is very frugal. He doesn't use a secretary. He personally opens and answers all the fan letters. He also doesn't hire many servants. When someone asked him, he said humorously: "There are too many people, and there is not even a place for couples to quarrel peacefully."</p>
<p>He said that it is rare for couples to quarrel, but it is a bedroom pleasure!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e221">Review of "Carefree Gentleman" <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>—— Golden City Screening</p>
<p>In the dark movie theater, I accidentally heard a woman's voice saying:</p>
<p>"Not quite humorous, not quite comical, not quite bitter, not quite tragic." These two very ordinary sentences seem to be a very appropriate criticism of "Carefree Gentleman." Indeed, as a slapstick film, "Carefree Gentleman" hides a bitter life under the guise of laughter, which is not an ordinary artistic expression.</p>
<p>Anyone can understand that the playwright has great sympathy for people who are forced by hunger and cold. They are homeless, they wander on the streets, they need jobs, and they have good personalities. But the cruel society forces them to the brink of death. In the cold winter, they try their best to live on; however, the result is still disappointment.</p>
<p>Here, Liu Jiqun and Han Langen are O-shaped urban wanderers. They are kind, law-abiding, they have extravagant hopes for a luxurious or enjoyable life, they hope to get married, they need women, and they will do their best to serve Mei Lin, although what they can do cannot exceed a high degree of friendship. Similarly, they also feel dizzy when they see the chaotic crowd in the dance hall. In the end, they think that as long as they have a house that doesn't leak, they are already content. More cruelly, they dress up as monkey shows and ask people for sympathy, but all they get is five copper coins. However, the playwright also believes that people's conscience is not dead. Doctors or landlords are ultimately moved by their kindness.</p>
<p>What we feel satisfied with in this film is that the authors did not give the audience harmful poison. The authors have kind hearts, which make the audience feel emotional about life, but at the same time, they did not point out a clear path for the liberation of the lives of these kind people, but merely a beautiful yearning for the beautiful spring.</p>
<p>In terms of performance form, this fully expresses the author's deep understanding of film art. However, experience is inevitably unfamiliar, which we can see in all aspects. Here, we can rarely see Laurel and Hardy-style slapstick, but also rarely see the natural expression of tearful laughter. Similarly, the dubbing here, compared to other dubbed national films, is quite competent in the harmony between music and plot, but it is not an extremely skilled performance. In terms of Tempo, this is trying to make it better, but the director did not fully grasp it. Because the panning shots are too slow and too long, they seem unsuitable for the tone of comedy. Similarly, the two actors are not geniuses of comedy. Han Langen stiffly makes ugly faces, which is too much acting, setting off Liu Jiqun's performance as more humane. In addition, in editing, it commits the same problem of wordy accumulation as other national films. At least I think some places should be cut shorter.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Review of "The Decisive Moment" <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>Society Doctor——Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>I remember in Ibsen's play "An Enemy of the People," a doctor was criticized by society and even treated as a public enemy for proposing to improve the water supply of the bathhouse.</p>
<p>Here in "The Decisive Moment," a doctor is also depicted who, in order to save a critically ill patient, disregards the patient's father's opposition and resolutely performs surgery, ultimately saving the patient from danger. Although the story of this film does not narrate a hero like the one created by Ibsen, with such power, passion for social reform, and struggle against stubborn ideas, the form of the first half of the story does have some similarities. The difference lies in the essence. Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People" has a deeper and more thorough understanding, which lasts to the end. "The Decisive Moment" is narrow, and the doctor has little understanding. This is where one can distinguish the difference between serious Nordic artists and mediocre American writers.</p>
<p>The director's handling of this film, apart from the tension in the air during the surgery, has few successes to point out, but the control of the actors is acceptable. In addition, there are scenes such as the nurse secretly drinking and eating meat, and the doctor's drunken dance, which subtly suggest satire of the hospital and are quite meaningful.</p>
<p>CbestenMcrrio, who plays Dr. Mao Gen, has had considerable achievements in screen acting. He does not disappoint us in this film, but this story clearly limits him. Otherwise, I think he could have displayed his talent more. The remaining roles seem to be placed in secondary positions and cannot have any distinctive features.</p>

<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Just then, the doorbell rang. It was a streetcar conductor. Tuo Lei was talking when he saw the conductor come in, and he suddenly fell silent. He looked at Ai Mei, then at the conductor. He silently walked out. Ai Mei saw his expression and felt sad. She pointed to her purse and asked the conductor to put it in the car. She couldn't say a word. She walked towards the car parked at the door. Her eyes were blurred with tears, and she stumbled into the car.</p>
<p>Ai Mei left Tuo Lei and returned to her aunt's house, but she could not forget Tuo Lei at any moment. She spent her days like years. She forced herself to attend all the banquets. She forced herself to pretend to be happy. No matter where she was, she always laughed loudly, appearing happier than others, but only Hua De could see her inner pain. He knew that she was outwardly strong but inwardly weak, so every time he saw her, he felt sorry for her. He also often went to see Tuo Lei, wanting to reason with him, to stop his reckless flying, risking his life, but Tuo Lei laughed it off and continued to do as he pleased.</p>
<p>Later, Ai Mei could not bear it anymore. She could not live without Tuo Lei. But at this time, Tuo Lei no longer listened to other people's advice. Once, Ai Mei saw Tuo Lei driving Hua De's car past. She shouted at him from behind, but he stepped on the gas and sped away. The dangerous situation made her cover her face and dare not look, and she cried alone.</p>
<p>That night, Ai Mei's house was holding a banquet. Ai Mei wore the most beautiful clothes and displayed the most cheerful attitude. She was laughing and talking alone. She said, "Why shouldn't I be happy? Life is like morning dew, enjoy yourself while you can. I am now a person living in the clouds!" Many people who heard her words were puzzled and didn't know how to respond, they could only laugh along with her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, all the happiness disappeared. Hua De suddenly walked in. He walked up to Ai Mei and said in a trembling voice, "Ai Mei... I and you... need to go to a place... right now." Ai Mei looked at him for a moment and said faintly, "I know... it must be Tuo Lei... something went wrong..." Hua De couldn't help but lower his head. He said, "He drove my car... the police just called me... he got into trouble in a nightclub near here." Ai Mei listened, and without a word, followed him away.</p>
<p>Ai Mei didn't know how she arrived at this place. She only knew that Tuo Lei was injured. His body was lying horizontally on the ground in a pagoda in the center of the garden, motionless, his face as pale as paper. Ai Mei walked to his side and knelt down. Tuo Lei opened his eyes, looked around, and shook his head slightly impatiently, saying, "What are these people doing sneaking around... do they think I'm going to die... is that right? I won't die... when I'm going to die... I'll wait until I'm better... until I'm prepared... before I'm prepared, I won't die... no one can tell me when to die..."</p>
<p>Ai Mei held back her tears and comforted him, "Of course not, my love." Tuo Lei said again, "When I die, I must die in the sky... not on this dirty ground... the car won't take my life." Ai Mei said, "Of course not." (To be continued)</p>
