<h3 id="c21">中東路非法賣買與日俄關係 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>日蘇中東路非法賣買談判。開始於一九三三年六月。其間經過無數之波折。乃卒於本年一月二十二日雙方成立妥恊。俄方不惜以一千四百萬元之最低限度代價。讓諸日人。並將於本月二十三日正式簽約。我政府對此問題。以主權所關。自難　默。故會疊向蘇日雙方提出抗議。本月十六日再提嚴重抗議。同時復根據民國十三年之中俄協定。分致聲明書於有關係各國。重申我國之立塲。雖其效果。在目前尙難逆覩。然爲否認此項非法賣買。保留我國在該路之一切權利計。要亦適當而必要之舉動也。</p>
<p>蘇俄之讓渡在我國境內之中東路。不獨不顧我國之主權。且爲違反中俄恊定。不合法理之舉動。此在中蘇邦交已復之今日。吾人殊不能不深抱遺憾。然一考蘇俄之所以不顧中國利益。而悍然出此。則與近時國際環境之推移亦有相當之關係。蓋（第一）自日本侵佔我東北四省。組織傀儡國以來。日俄雙方無時不處於正面衝突之地位。而中東路之糾紛。大有成爲兩國戰爭導火線之可能。今俄方對日所以不得不多方讓步。求暫時之相安。其目的乃在勉强保持和平。以進行其社會主義建設之原定計劃。（第二）自偽滿吉會拉濱北黑等鐵路完成以後。中東路在經濟上早已失去其獨立性。卽一旦日俄戰事發生。勝負之數。不在此路之得失。（第三）就歐西之關係言。希特勒之雄心。咄咄逼人。其通過波蘭以奪取烏克蘭之企圖。未嘗一日終止。最近復公然宣言廢除凡爾賽和約中之軍備條欵。整軍經武。尤其敢作反蘇聯先鋒之表示。此種形勢。早爲蘇聯所洞悉。爲免除其爲東西雙方夾擊之危險計。故對於中東路問題不得不對日讓步。</p>
<p>雖然。中東路非法讓渡交涉之成功。果可以緩和日蘇間緊張之關係乎。此亦吾人值得注意之問題也。論者每謂「中東路讓渡交涉之成功。不僅足以消滅蘇聯在遠東赤化之策源地。且日俄間外交上之糾紛形勢。亦可從此一掃而空。故中東路賣買成立以後。日本對於滿洲之統治。將更趨鞏固。滿鐵對於全滿鐵道。亦可放手經營。使北滿資源容易開發。對俄輸出。日漸增加。由是日蘇關係可以愈趨緩和。而兩國之邦交。亦有日趨和平親善之可能」。但依吾人之觀察。日蘇間中東路讓渡之成功。固爲緩和日蘇關係初步之成功。然若對於今後之日蘇關係過於樂觀。恐亦失之過早。何以言之。日蘇關係之重心。不盡在中東路糾紛之解决。而實在不侵犯條約之如何訂立。而日方是否願與俄方訂立不侵犯條約。實爲今後兩國關係是否眞能趨於緩和之重要關鍵。今後亞東國際關係之如何發展。亦將依此問題之變化而轉移。其次。吾人所宜注意者。卽日蘇在海參崴沿海之漁業衝突。日方之意。在掃除蘇俄在東方沿海之漁業勢力。俄方於此。是否亦願拱手讓人。大是疑問。再次。日軍部之雄心。在奪取俄屬西伯利亞東沿海濱省之地。同時。排除蘇俄在外蒙新疆之潛勢力。以完成其獨佔東亞必要之準備。現在中東路之讓渡。雖已告成功。日方是否適可而止。願與蘇聯保持恒久之相安。恐在目前。莫敢遝作肯定之預言。設或日方不以此爲滿足。而作再進一步之要求。俄方是否再步步退讓。不予抵抗。此亦大堪思索與想像之問題也。</p>
<p>凡此皆與中東路非法賣買相關之重要問題。此種種問題之如何開展。不獨與我國有深切之關係。且與整個東亞之安危。亦有莫大之影響。故吾人亦未可忽視之也。</p>

<p>（巴黎）德國破壞凡爾賽和約軍事條欽、擅行恢復强迫軍役制後、此間各報均主張列强急應組織集團、保障和平、使莊嚴之條約、不至被公然破壤而不受懲罰、使歐洲之秩序、得以保障、尤其要求英法意三國應密切合作、其中小巴黎人報謂、「列强對於德國此舉之初步反響、殆已確定、卽將由各國駐德大使、對德國作强有力之抗議是也、惟此外各國政府或亦將鄭重發表宣言、聲明德國此舉性質之嚴重、至於英外相西門訪徳之行、如仍照原定計畫進行、則恐未必有何結果、蓋因德國已顯然反對東歐互助公約也、反之、法外長賴伐爾聘訪莫斯科之舉、則爲一般人之所期望」云、日報則謂「當一九一四年、大戰開始前德國預料英國不致干涉歐陸之事、故敢胃不韙、諾起戰禍、今欲使德國不至重施故智、則其唯一有效方法、厥爲由列强組織鎭靜而堅决之集團、庶幾可耳」、巴黎迥聲報則以英國踟蹰瞻顧、無所决定、引爲憾事、謂「德國輒因列强遲疑不定、而坐收其利、今茲之事、亦猶然耳」云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）伊斯維斯太報首篇論德國實施普遍軍役制云、「蘇聯並非凡爾賽和約之簽字國、故不必以外交與法理之觀點、分析此項大事、吾人所關心者、僅限於其政治的意義耳、吾人如謂德國軍備旣已存在、則凡爾賽和約之取消、僅係一種形式與姿勢、此實大謬、德國今日實施普遍軍役並宣告重整軍備、正欲實現其深刻的實際目的、故上所云云、並不正確、德國今日正拒絕一切公約、宣言自由整飭軍備、以期於最短期內、獲取近兩年來創造之軍事技術、是故吾人所見者爲德國之加速戰事準備耳、</p>
<p>「德國與英外相之談判已迫在眼睫、此後復將與法國談判、德國此次片面脫離凡爾賽和約之約束、適在英德談判開始前一星期、此舉對於若輩願意承認德國在一般安全組織中有平等權利之列强、顯係一種挑釁、此種步驟大有其政治目的、法英意三國願意取消對於德國軍備之限制、而與限制德國侵略政策之政治約束相交換、同時彼等擬與德國作軍備分量之妥協、唯德國則以宣言實施普遍軍役制爲答覆、其意若曰、德國軍備分量已由徳國自定之、故彼於安全領域中不必担任何種義務、以與軍備問題上對彼之讓步相交換、故徳國此舉之目的、乃令德國在安全領域由不負何等義務、德國帝國主義將選定一犧牲品、以大試其鐵腕、故此舉爲在政治上作戰爭之凖備、「德國此種政策全由列强自身（第一爲英國）之政策造成、彼等贊成德國、並鼓勵德國政策之領袖曰、冒險之舉此其時矣、並向之表示任何舉動、均得許可、如徳國以與英國分別談判之建議、打擊英法陣綫、以爲二月三日英法提案之答覆、唯德方建議竟爲接受矣、爻如當各方要求徳國參加保障全歐和平組織之際、德國以拒絕增進和平相答覆、唯德國所得回音竟爲一種安慰劑、其意日、彼等必能有某種妥洽、一若戰爭與和平眞有妥洽可能者、如此如此、徳國外交乃具有一種信念、卽彼得換左券是也、德國爲證實此項信念計、初則要求西門外相延期赴德、此種舉動已非外交史上所經見矣、唯其答覆則爲一種溫柔動聽之語調、於是德國遂出其最後第二着、不管凡爾賽和約之禁止、宣言自四月一日起卽當設置空軍、而此舉亦竟爲人接受、是德國於其政策復將有何羞怯乎、彼不僅挫敗其敵人、其在國內且有更大之勝利、卽高舉德國民族主義之浪潮、而令法西政府在戰爭準備中之地位、益爲鞏固、吾人固知德國重整軍備之速度、及其拒絕各種外交公約之堅决態度、均爲德國凖備實際行動之象徵、其目的果爲奧國乎（希特拉近謂德國問題須照薩爾問題解决、但澤乎（但澤雖非德國領土、而其上議院議長於其政府文件之末附以「希特拉萬歲」等字）抑爲美末爾乎、無人能道之、唯有一事絕無疑義、卽德國最近一舉已預定其政治侵略之行動矣、</p>
<p>「在此塲合一切須視徳國政策利鋒所指之列强態度而定、彼等一遇德國之侵略、果能迅速組成互助之組織乎、柏林方面如能了解此種組織無論德國願否加入、必能見諸實際、則彼將憬悟徳國一國究不敵願意維持和平之列强之集團矣、「時不吾待、不容遲疑不决矣、今日之问題乃在德國旣已表明其目的、則其他各國亟應表明其保衛手段、及其保衛歐洲及全人類和平之能力」云、（十八塔斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）衆議院預算總會本日上午十一時許開始討論內閣審議會問題、淸瀨規矩雄與岡田首相之問答情形如次、淸瀨問、內閣審議會之設立理由如何、岡田首相答、樹立現下非常時之國策、問、有無考慮政黨政治之復歸問題、答、內閣審議會與政黨政治毫無關係、問、然則設立內閣審議會是否超然內閣之補强工作、</p>
<p>答、不然、樹立國家百年大計之機關也、問、該會所審議之所謂重要國策者爲何、答、地方自治體之問題、中央及地方之財政、稅利之整理問題等、問、此種問題閣議不能協議乎、答、重要國策內閣不能决定、故特此內閣審議會以爲諮問機關、問、閣內意見、應由首相統制、故內閣審議會之設立、是否忘却首相責任、答、內閣並非不能樹立重要國策、審議會之設立、能使各省關係圓滑、問、審議會使各省關係圓滑、不是越權行爲乎、首相欲避免負責任乎、答、一切責任應由首相負之、問、在岡田內閣成立後始設如此機關、可謂暴露內閣之無經倫與無自信、國策審議之設立、非如屋上造屋耶、答、設在內閣之下、不能謂屋上造屋（滿塲失笑）、</p>
<p>淸瀨又問軍事外交問題、一時十八分休息、午後一時繼續開會、由中谷貞賴氏關於內閣審議會問題提出質、茲錄其問答情形如左、</p>
<p>問、審議會所議定之案件究應如何處理、就此項情形觀之、豈非內閣失其统一乎、以如此重大之政策、所包含之預算爲何遲至今日始提出、</p>
<p>首相答、因有各種情形、乃遷延迄今、自當認爲抱歉、</p>
<p>問、無論如何、非通過不可之第二預備金增加項下、而將內閣審議會之預算合而爲一、亦欲使之通過、是否由此種不純正之思想而有所遷延、</p>
<p>答、不純正之思想完全無有、</p>
<p>問、內閣審議會是否爲永久性質、</p>
<p>答、因係樹立國家大計者、尙以永久性質爲宜、倘內閣更替、而該會亦隨之更替、殊覺無謂也、</p>
<p>問、爲何不採取無任何大局之制度、高橋藏相聞曾亦抱有此項見解、是否屬實、其意見若何、</p>
<p>藏相答、余曾亦抱有此項意見、但現在已决定以審議會爲最宜、星島二郎氏（政友）質問如左、內閣審議會之陣容旣不若美國之智能顧問會、又不若德國之經濟參謀本部、而與蘇聯之國家計劃委員會最相類似、值此議會政治復活之際、而有此種無趣之情形、究不知所見若何、首相答、內閣審議會决非如上項等類之情形、亦非妨害議會之權能者也云云、（十八日日聯電）</p>

<p>擬發五億元</p>
<p>該會議中、除討論組織商業經濟協會外、並曾討論一番要提案、卽擬建議發行流通券五萬萬元、其辦法係以百分之六十爲現金凖備、餘百分之四十、以地產爲擔保、並請政府設地契保管庫、其發行五萬萬流通券之理由、係認爲目前一上海市存欵共計十萬萬元、爲使此種存一欵流通起見、擬以地產等爲抵押、發行流通庫券、俾使市面稍形活躍、並假擬該項流通券發行期限爲五年、年息五厘、</p>

<p>天津女子姚錦屏、女化男身之事、已引起各界之注意、故昨晨前往一瞻姚氏丰采者、大不乏人、同時醫學界亦有前往探視者、</p>
<p>各界好奇爭往觀瞻</p>
<p>昨晨本市市民爲好奇心所衝動、而爭往巨籍達路采濤里十八號觀瞻此女化男身之姚錦屏氏、竟肩摩踵接、姚氏祖孫大感應酬之繁、婦科醫生毛文杰醫師、亦於昨晨十時前往姚寓探詢、當要求檢視、惟姚以女態未除、且變身以來、祇及五月、故經約於本星期内、再前往毛氏處檢騐、</p>
<p>陽具與常人稍兩樣</p>
<p>毛乃以手隔褲探診、據毛旋向華東社記者表示、乃係「女性假性半陰陽」、即俗謂雌孵雄者是也、姚之陽具發生後、（即變後）與一般男子稍兩樣、似祇有陰核而缺睪丸、陰莖在陰核上、包皮雖可翻、觸手即硬、但女性陰道分泌物甚多、褲聞似有一種氣味、乳房右大左小、仍係女性模樣云云、</p>
<p>杭州曾有類是事件</p>
<p>又據毛氏稱、在民國十九年時、杭州靑年路同仁外科醫院、亦曾有一紹興人士、本係男性、忽患病甚劇、而發現陽具收縮、且有月經等女性生理變化、經該院王吉人醫師、用科學方法、人造一女性內生殖器、旋經病愈返紹、</p>

<p>本星期內即行返津</p>
<p>姚此次隨其祖慶普先生來滬、本係應李杜將軍之召者、姚固思父心切、擬隨抗日將士家屬、於最短期內、轉道赴新疆遂其萬里尋父之順、今李氏以其志堪深造、經勸告返津原籍再事深造、故决於本星期内、仍由其祖挈之返津云、</p>

<p>又據日日社稱、咋有比利時魯文大學（專門研究病理解剖學有五百餘年之歷史）醫學博士王顧寗氏、前往訪問、並要求檢騐、王氏係前任比京鐵路總醫院手術科醫師及英國曼且斯特皇家醫院神經系統醫師、對於男女生理變態學理研究頗有心得、據談、女性變爲男性、現世醫學界已研究此生理變態問題、有多數病理解剖學家、曾發現（生後屍體解剖）其副腎精與卵巢在顯微病理上有顯著之病態、副腎組織外層（Substance　Corticale）更爲顯著、故名爲副腎化男體、（Virilisme　Surrenalien）其變態之起、無固定之病症、因年齡及溫熱帶等氣候、又與生理有密切關係、據學者們之觀察、如此病理解剖現象、發生於溫帶之五六歲女童、其生殖器內外、皆如成年之女子、月潮亦來、如屬男童、有此病、其生殖器體格心理、亦變爲成年人、如屬老年女子、有此病、胡髭聲音體格等、皆變爲男子、惟生殖器外部變爲男性、大抵屬將成年之靑年女子、其內分泌變化由來已久、姚錦屏一聞雷聲而便變爲男子、不過乃彼僩人之錯覺或幻覺、絕非事實如此、歐洲從前亦有如姚錦屏輩者、在警察局中、復將居留證上之性別、由女改爲男、然實則外似男而內仍女、其變化之原因、尙待詳細的實地研究、僅就病理解剖之内分泌生理變態而言、或者除已經證明之上述二種而外、當有其他多數病理、尙待生理病理解剖等學之證實云云、</p>

<p>人們常把『戴有色眼鏡」一辭來譬喻帶成見論事的人，其實這是錯誤的。在初帶有色眼鏡的時候，固然會五色莫辨，通過紅眼鏡的都是紅，通過綠眼鏡的都是綠，但日子久了，也就漸漸各色俱分，而不會紅綠不辨的。這只要問慣戴有色眼鏡的人就知道。</p>
<p>美國惠格爾博士計算：第一次世界大戰所耗的錢，如果在孔老夫子時每秒鐘丟掉一塊美金，如此則一分鐘爲六十金元，一點鐘爲三千六百金元，一天爲八萬六千四百金元，這樣一直丟到現在二三千年的總和，還只有大戰所耗總數的一半。如果從現在再丟起，恐怕還得二三千年，才能丟到和大戰所耗一樣的數目。戰爭所耗費用之巨，實在太驚人了！</p>
<h3 id="c182">龍華塔史略 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>在中國點綴風景之浮屠，不下二千餘處，而龍華尤爲著者之一；故國人莫不知之。浮屠之建，導源印度，隨佛敎東漸而入中國，中國之有浮屠，迄今已一千六百餘年矣。然建塔之制，雖肇端乎印度，而華人秉其智巧，別出心裁，與印度之塔爲狀大異；且自堪輿家視爲有關風水，舉世風靡，而浮屠遂徧於各地矣。中國各地，浮屠形式，並不一律·，南方之塔，其形式色澤均優美；北方之塔，外觀頗見簡單，其迴廊多無雕欄；惟建築極堅實，中有旋梯，以達塔巔。浮屠之高，自七級至十三級不等；而直隸定州最高之塔，則達三百六十尺云。</p>
<p>歷年旣久，最初所建之塔，類皆圯毀不復存在，今之所見者，雖或巍然仍其故址，多出自後此之重建，明淸二朝，浮屠之重建者，不勝枚舉；惟龍華塔之建築，則尙在明以前數百年，據上海縣志所載，最初爲三國時所建，其時吳大帝奄有江表，西自武昌，南控閩越，物力充裕，斯塔以瓶，歷四百餘年而至唐，曾葺而新之，名其旁剎爲龍華寺，而塔名以定，未幾黃巢起事，寺塔同毀於火，直至二百數十年以後，錢氏建國斯土，號稱吳越。至忠懿王立始命莊務將張仁泰督工重建，聞忠懿王泛舟黃浦，夜泊江中見天際有光，閃爍於塔之故址，以爲祥，故有是命，今之巍然矗立爲上海標識者，卽此塔也。</p>

<p>— 史段</p>
<p>只消一下雨，許多泥漿都擠到馬路上來了，晴天它們不知藏身在那里的？眞怪，行人一出門，這些可惡的小東西便緊緊的緾牢了你的脚，使你覺得分外的討厭，眞如一個小百姓討厭那般趾高氣揚的大人先生們一般。—這是南京雨中所別具的風味，我到過杭州，到過上海……但是沒有比在南京的雨天更引人不快了。一見陰雲遍佈，我的心便輕輕地壓上了層憎厭。</p>
<p>本來，南京整個的十分之八是蕭條的，冷淸的，一經凄雨飄洒，南京就立刻更陷在寂寞的　井里，試問到過南京的人，雨給了他的印象又是如何呢。</p>
<p>那些汽車，一到雨天，滿在街路上橫衝直撞、恣意的馳騁，發出來的啦叭聲，又是如何的傲慢呀，尤其在雨天，對於一切伶仃的人力車或是馬車，簡直是一種威脅。</p>
<p>南京的雨，我一想起來便覺得可怕，可怕的是那些晴天不知藏身在那兒，而雨了後立刻都擠到馬路上與行人的脚來作對的泥漿，但是我又想起了托爾斯泰所作的一個短篇：「爭自由的波浪」來了，泥漿雖渺小，却也有他的毅力與自由（生命），我們豈可忽視了它們，偉大的生命！</p>

<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>小時候跟老祖母燒火煮飯的時候，有時會對我說：「火石打光了，寶寶你聽着有火石擔來，呌來買一塊新的用。」小耳朵裏聽着，滿喜歡地。到明天兀自留心着那嗒喇嗒的聲音，因爲這是我要買坭佛佛玩的絕好機會。在常時老祖母輕易不肯買給我玩，唯一的希望祇得買新火石時，才敢開口要買個把玩。所以小時候對火石擔是很注意的。</p>
<p>賣火石的江北人，搖着隻艒艒船到我們東山來，男的總是做皮匠，女的背着火石擔去兜村莊賣火石。伊們手指裏挾着兩片蛤蜊壳，嗒喇嗒喇地拷擊着。不但賣火石，又兼收着鞋子去給伊丈夫上鞋底。據祖母說：坭佛佛還在我會學步時新添的。</p>
<p>火石逐漸地給火柴打倒了，伊們的擔上就又添着針線之類。可是最近回鄉去，伊們的擔上貨物又改了樣，除了針線之外，簡直變成了雜貨擔，又添着線襪，絲襪，手帕，胭脂，花粉的化妝品了。最使我刺眼的；坭佛佛却絕少見到，却改着上面寫着英文字的某國的玩具了。在這裏，使我看出了在我們偏僻的東山的娘兒們也在學時髦了，又感到那無孔不入的某國的玩具，也深入到我的家鄉了。</p>

<p>— 張皇</p>
<p>在夫婦日常生活間的談話，有時一方須作空虛的安慰的表示—儘如所說的「口惠而實不至」，祇爲適應環境；對方呢，但望你有這一點安慰表示出在相當的時間，也已感念而知足了！這並晨說：在共同生活的愛侶間該有什麼虛偽的情意的必要，却全仗這一點手續得搆通和融合雙方的靈感，不可簡免的。不然，往往你雖竭力做着實際上安慰的工作，因爲你搔不着癢處，還是得不到對方的寬慰或同情情，但看：「長門盡日無梳洗，何必珍珠慰寂寥」一斛明珠祇換得意外的幾句怨詩，豈非不値得！</p>
<p>還有，有時一方所作的請求，但望得到對方一時口頭的允許就滿足了，並不眞需見到實行的；因爲那項請求—給與的或容納的都不論—只存測騐愛戀或試探同情的作用罷了。在這等情形之下，你也免不得要隨口敷衍一聲，千萬放心决不會有什麼困難跟着發生的。</p>
<p>譬如：一天，妻在出門之前忽忙地整妝，爲伊自己畫眉不能稱意，焦惱着喊道：「怎麽這般那般總描不好的啊！」</p>
<p>這時，夫在一旁理着旁的事情，凑趣說道：「待我來替你描罷。」</p>
<p>「好的。」妻應聲說，一壁還是自顧繼續描着，並沒有歇手等候伊丈失來效勞。可是奇怪，事態倏忽轉爲順利，伊的工作迅速完成了；伊覺得很滿意！</p>
<p>試想，當妻在自憤聲不成樣，忍不住喊出來的時候，伊的內心裏是何等地焦躁！要是做丈的恐防格外擾亂伊的工作，默不接口，怕不要又在這悄沒聲兒的環境中引起伊的誤會，道是他故意袖手旁觀，不願理會麼？他這麽一說，「待我來替你描」，至少拾妻知道他的愛護伊的美意了！並且，丈夫替妻子畫眉，原經人們公認爲閨房樂事的；這麼一個又風流又體貼的印象經他喚起，似在目前，會發生怎樣一種不可思議的調劑惡劣情感的效力，使伊的心裏得到安慰啊！事情的實行不實行，又有什麽關係呢？</p>
<p>至於「待我來替你描」這句你，隨口說出却帶有請求的意思；他在中途接替做這項畫眉工作，能不能迅速而有效，這在他自己恐怕也沒有把握哩。妻也明知這情形，也許知道他决難勝任，伊的本心實在不願他更滋糾紛；但是伊的口頭怎能直捷爽快地拒絕他的殷勤的貢獻呢？伊只得姑且漫應着，算是領他的情了。這樣，伊在意亂心煩之下並不盛氣用事的好習性，足徵伊對待丈夫極度的愛，同時他的慰藉能使伊格外地心氣和平，伊的眉毛終於描成了！</p>
<p>夫妻間聞話的極微細處，關係環境多少重大，奉告諸位結婚階級，實在忽略不得啊！</p>

<p>不邊我雖然如此戀像，但據我後來發現，這些當心着育蠶的女孩子們，—伊們多半是旗兵的女兒—對於蠶實在是很歡喜的；所以揣着蠶子睡覺的事情，眞可說是司空見慣，一些也不値得大驚小怪。</p>
<p>我正在糢糢糊糊地懸想揣着蠶子睡覺的滋味的當兒，太后又說話了。</p>
<p>「瞧啊！這不是才孵化出來的嗎」？伊又走到了屋子的另一角上去。「但它們是長成得很快的，你差不多可以看着它長；大約再過七天或八天之後，便要開始餵大張的桑棄了。」</p>
<p>這裏的幾個木架子上却擱着許多圓形的矮盤，它們是竹製的，盤底的一部份用的是極光滑的竹黃；它們的邊約有一寸半高，也是竹片紮的。這些竹盤的大小各各不同，想必是各有各的用處的。依我看來，那些才孵化的春蠶，也不過像一種常在花樹上可以見到的小靑蟲一樣，神氣也是很難看的；祇差它們身上沒有花紋，而是遍體灰白而已。它們大概一律都是七八分長，一個小小的竹盤子裏，約莫擠着一二百條；蠕蠕地在滾動，我看了險些當做是一盤的蛆。</p>
<p>我雖然並不覺得這些蠶有什麽好看，甚至還覺得很難看，但是因爲聽見太后說它們是長得很快的，差不多可以看着它們長，因此就打動了我的好奇心（二七〇）</p>

<h3 id="c213">接受批評 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>武者小路實篤曾經做過一篇呌做「凡有藝術品」的短文，力勸作家們要堅定地走着自己的路，走到有確信的處所去，一切磨折都可以不管。話頭也帶着了批評，他說：</p>
<p>批評家的一想情願的要求，置之不理就是。他們本不是眞心希望着作者好起來。他們也是人，不會根本地懂得別人的作品的。……</p>
<p>這種意見，在現在的中國文藝界，是非常時髦的，而且也的確有一點勢力。自從去年以來，無論是作家或者並不是作家，一齊在非難批評，而其唯一的抵制的方法，據說也正是「置之不理」。</p>
<p>對於那所批評的是「置之不理」了，而對於　　　者，却照例終有幾句話說。或者說：「這是台灣人呀！」或者說：「這是某系某派呀！」而比較澈底的，則是：「喂！你指着你自己的鼻子了。」</p>
<p>批評家要批評別人，不料却指着了鏡子里的自己的鼻子，這雖然像是笑話，但看客們的理智是决不會就此埋沒在自己的笑聲里的，因爲他們仍然能够知道，這鼻子的確很黑。</p>
<p>有着堅定的路可走的人，就不妨去走着他那堅定的路。現在雖然沒有怎樣完善的批評，但也並沒有絕對荒謬的批評家。路是永遠堅定的。批評家不過以旁觀者的立塲，指出那條路上的荊棘，歧岔，他决不至於呌你向後轉。</p>
<p>但現在據說又是連眞理也在疼哭了，這是因爲批評家罵倒了一切。</p>
<p>事家上，罵也還有分別的。開日就是「媽的」的漫罵固然要不得；可是能够捉住破綻而細數之的疼罵，却仍舊可以接受。</p>
<p>就因爲批評家「也是人」，我們相信，他是能够「懂得別人的作品的」。</p>
<h3 id="c214">泥水匠陳秋 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>「三槐！——這是我第十二次碰見牠了，這畜生！牠一面在那里蹦蹦跳跳，又朝着我喀嘻笑……」泥水匠陳秋躺在曖味的灰色和藍色構成的床上，用手揑住他底粗大的喉嚨，做了幾聲傑傑的猴子底笑。空氣被壓在肺管裏面，好像從耳朶，鼻子，甚至眼睛擠出夾、，因而使得他底臉完全脹紅了。</p>
<p>他用旋風一般的力量翻開被窩。他底全身瘦削的骨頭，突露到破爛的底衫外面，非常勉强地支撐住他底過於沉重的大腦袋，幾乎每一秒鐘都有散裂開來的可能。他在泥地上跳躍着，企圖抖掉那立刻像黃蜂底毒針一樣向他全身襲搫的寒冷的空氣，向他底女人——她正蹲在小火爐前面的松柴烟裏——繼續誇張地說，而且提到她們底女兒阿喜底名字。</p>
<p>「那畜生越過越走近我面前了。抓住牠不要放，用中指挖牠底喉嚨，牠就會變成一袋銀子——凡是上了年紀的聰明的脚色都懂得的！叫阿喜來猜猜看，她遺敢買別個字麽？自然不會的！她也只好買三槐，而且曉得他底老子還有這麽一點運氣。老鬼，你爲什麽一聲不響呢，我昨天晚上做了這麽一個　騐的夢……」</p>
<p>那約莫五十歲的女人騰雲似地從濃烟裏冒出半截身子來，機械地回答他：</p>
<p>「阿喜買菜去了，來洗臉吧。你是常常做夢的，阿秋。」</p>
<p>於是陳秋就嘰哩咕嚕地咀咒着她底女人，記憶起所有關於她的愚蠢，可惡的過錯，和由她帶來的倒霉的運氣，然後開始從每一個可能的地方搜索現錢。</p>
<p>「賭字花算不得怎樣了不起的坎事！只有你這個　良心的老鬼……」</p>
<p>晚上，在那些不會被砍掉的，五六丈高的大榕樹頂上，北風像海浪似地圍繞着，簡搫着，和靑蒼的無萬的樹葉搏戰，不住地把牠們哨下來，然後用牠底冰冷的蹄子踐踏牠們。陳秋家裏會有尖銳的，女人底呌喊聲刺破那宏大的聲浪，傳到四面的鄰人底耳朶裏。</p>
<p>於是他們就開始推測那泥水匠生氣的理由了。</p>
<p>「今天早塲開出個什麽東西，不是猴子麽？」</p>
<p>「不，一條鰲魚。」</p>
<p>爲了買字花，他跟他底女兒阿喜，那大額頭底下，藏着兩隻呆鈍無光的眼睛，說起話來比她底母親更顯得愚蠢頑固的，二十一二歲的女孩子，也常常要吵嘴。她不相信他父親做的夢，和任何賭字花的人都用感激的心情去接受的那種種的暗示，甚至完全不願意談論到牠們。她只是把她所有的錢隨意買在一個字上面，隨後就把那件事忘記掉了，彷彿永遠沒有對她自己做的事存過什麽希望。</p>
<p>他們住的地方是在右都統衙門裏，那些正在大規模地建造新式洋房的地基附近，靠近幾條種着生菜和葱的菜壟的，一間用舊的木板和鋅鐵搭蓋起來的小木屋。早上，在陳秋還沒有開工的時候，他底威嚇的聲音就從那裏面竄出來：</p>
<p>「三槐！沒有別個字的。……你敢，輸了我就扭斷你底　子，你這敗家精！我昨天晚上又夢見給鬼追了——這不是夢兆是什麽，爲什麽我要做這樣一個夢！」</p>
<p>但他底女兒仍然平靜而帶點厭煩地答他：</p>
<p>「各人有各人底心思，總之我不相信你。」</p>
<p>「那麼，你相信誰呢？」</p>
<p>在全個冬季最寒冷的那幾天裏面，泥水匠陳秋底向前突出的，闊大而粗糙的額頭，眼睛，鼻子，嘴巴，更腫脹，而且更紅起來了。用愤憤不平的步伐走路，身體前傾着，頭部具有一種要詳細査看什麽東西的姿勢。在路上和工作塲裏，他底　亮的嗓子一點顧忌都沒有地講着每個人都已經知道的事情……一個過着冗長無味的生活，從事單調的，沒有價值的工作的人民，是不能不鼓動一些爭吵，或庸俗的辯論來塡補靈魂底空虛，或者做出極無意義的舉動來做遺發寂寞的代價的。</p>
<p>有一個晴天的下午，泥水匠陳秋從一間平房底瓦背上滾下地面來了。他突然這樣地終結了他底一生。他底伙計們都聽見他被這個迅速的滾動捲起來的時候，曾經大聲喊着：</p>
<p>「抓住牠……抓……挖牠底喉嚨——中指！」這樣的，或者類似的聲音。沒有一個人能够指出那裏面裝着些什麽意思。</p>
<p>有一個年老的挑山水的工人，一頭「猪屎札」雀子似地擠進人堆裏，不假思索地帷測着，說：</p>
<p>「他大槪是喝醉了酒吧？但是，現在是來不及嘔吐的了」。</p>
<p>太陽强烈地照着那具已經完全靜止的屍體，牠側臥着，兩隻脚斜斜地仲開，所有的手指——在牠底軀幹底左右——都扣在鬆鬆的泥土裏，好像死者曾經用力拔起了地面，因而自已也栽倒了。從太大了的腦袋裏淌出的鮮血被太陽的蒸發出紅色的霧氣，鮮明，美麗，而且有着濕暖的腥味。這里完全沒有恐怖的痕跡，也沒有虛偽哭啼，一切都莊重而嚴肅……太陽替牠盤上金光璀燦的錦被，雲朶替牠加上一幅疏落的黑紗。生命仍然是快樂而偉大的。</p>

<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>魯河靜靜地。</p>
<p>正是十四五，黑龍江的夜空是淸朋的。沒有犬吠，沒有雞鳴。銀色的月，高懸在遼遠的地方，靜靜地，人們已經安睡</p>
<p>由於一種特殊的事件，我們四個弟兄，在這樣的深夜，躱藏在一個農人的家裏。耐不住春寒的襲搫，取了些乾柴，我們烘起火來。</p>
<p>默默地，我們烘着火，大家全不言不語。祇是用我們的四對敏銳的耳朶聽着，外邊是否有人叩門，步聲或槍聲。因爲我們每個人的心境裏都在打着算盤：思慮着。</p>
<p>誠摯的老百姓通知我們，昂昂溪現在敵人的兵力很是薄弱，一點鐘前，我們已經有二百五十個弟兄向那兒出發了。昂昂溪距離這個河岸並不遠，據我們所知，不過只二個小時半的路程。如果在天亮前我們能够看見火光時，那便可預知我們弟兄是勝利了。</p>
<p>若是在三小時以後沒有消息回來，我們是要再派一大批人去的。我們以手輕輕地撫着火堆，使它的光不致過大，同時屏息着在聽聞外面的響聲。</p>
<p>宇宙間是安靜的，决沒有一點響動，值得引起我們的懷疑。我們四個弟兄，僅祇在各人的腦海裏想像着這番事件的開展。</p>
<p>「咚」！彷彿有種東西從後面的墙上落下來。</p>
<p>「報信的不該回來哩，沒到時候，怕是有探子」！</p>
<p>有個弟兄這麼說。</p>
<p>於是，囑咐了一句：將子彈塞進膛，提了槍我們兩人走出去。繞着田家屯我們尋找了一週；黑的屋角，大樹旁，我們沒有發現什麽。拐回來，我們仍然烘着火。</p>
<p>停留在屋裏還不到半點鐘，外面又有聲音了，這回比剛纔要大一些。我們偷偷地溜了出去，瞧見村外有個人影在那兒搖幌，我們走沒多遠，給那傢伙發覺了，他死命的奔，我們同樣地追趕着。</p>
<p>「老弟，別開槍，咱們捉活的」！我跑着嚷道。</p>
<p>急速地，那傢伙給這位英勇的弟兄一刺刀截倒了，他一聲也沒喊。眞凑巧，剛好刺斷了咽喉，他絕了氣！</p>
<p>待我們歸來，經過魯河的堤上，流水依然靜靜地。但，我們瞧見了遠處的火光，我們的心在笑着。</p>
<p>分散的光景，在薄淡的晨曦裏，我們認明那給我們刺死的是個乞丐。</p>
<p>「眞不該啊！叫化子也帮助過我們哩」！</p>
<p>那位刺死他的弟兄，面容上立刻浮起一道難堪的憂傷。</p>
<h3 id="c217">戰爭雜記（五） <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 德永直作葉蔭譯</p>
<p>那一天，爲着祝賀的緣故，學校裏放了假，不上課，只是由校長說了幾句奉天城陷落了，日本軍大勝利的話。</p>
<p>村中的土地廟裏，擺下了祭神的酒。姑母就恰似姑丈明天就要從戰地回來了一般地覺得高興。</p>
<p>俄國的俘虜給送來了。說是十三團所拿獲的紅胡子的俄國鬼都要關到敎塲中的臨時搭好的小屋子裏去，我們就跟村裏的人們一塊兒跑去看。</p>
<p>俄國鬼通通都是大個子。正如我所想像的，他們的胡子都是紅的，眼睛跟玻璃一般，似乎很遲鈍的樣子。通通都戴着　子般的帽兒。并且，俘虜們看見了我們小孩子的臉孔都喃喃地說着話，笑嘻嘻地走過去。</p>
<p>「俄國鬼在笑！」</p>
<p>我們很　得俄國鬼沒有出息。槍和劍都給收繳了，還是這麽笑嘻嘻的。我不由的覺得不可思議。</p>
<p>我們在放學回家的時候，每天都彎路去看俘虜。</p>
<p>「懦弱的紅鬍子！」</p>
<p>「你們的劍那裏去了？」</p>
<p>我們從竹柵外面，對着那給嚴緊地幽禁着的俄國鬼謾罵着，或是把石子丟進去，大約費了一個鐘頭的樣子。</p>
<p>但，俄國鬼决不生氣。他們的長的紅頭髮，都弄得很亂的，喃喃地說些什麽話，對我們笑着。在小屋子的欄柵前面走來走去的日本看守兵，他的身軀的高度，大約只能達到他們的胸邊。</p>
<h3 id="c218">活字與死字（三） <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 陳友琹</p>
<p>我以爲敎人家讀書作文，萬不可以自已爲出發點，站在自己的地位上說話。髻如曹先生以爲寫錯字不要緊，在曹先生的筆下，有古書可以作法賓，知道如何別，是別到故紙堆裏去了，如何別，是別到古人家裏去了。可憐靑年們那裏會明白其中就裏呢，於是萬萬不可以通用的字也通用起來了，萬萬不可以少的筆畫少起來了，萬萬不可以多的筆畫又多起來了，結果，呌人家猜不透句中妙義。我和兩位同事，常常在一塊兒，捧若學生課卷，發愣，亂猜。</p>
<p>記得前年北大招考，投考生有寫「倡明」者，當然是昌明之誤。有寫「流學生」者，當然是留字之誤。劉半農敎授作打油詩去嘲弄偗，（見論語二十六期）固然不應該，魯迅先生曲爲之辨，（見准風月談一五〇頁）亦大可不必，總之「倡」與「流」等字，都是錯誤，應該加以指正的。</p>
<p>至於曹先生所堅持的最大理由，以爲古人可以寫別人，今日靑年爲什麽不可以寫別字呢？關於這一點，我覺得我們的同行何仲英先生的話，可以做我的代表，不妨照抄一段如下：</p>
<p>何著中國文字學大綱第七十九頁八十頁上說：</p>
<p>「……古人用通借，也是寫別字，也是不該。不過積古相沿，一向通行，到如今沒有法子强人改正。假使個個字都能够改正，是易經裏所說的「幹父之蠱」。縱使不能，豈可在古人寫的別字以外再加許多別字呢？古人寫的別字，通行到如今，全國相同，所以還可解得。今人若添寫許多別字，各處用各處的方音去寫，別省別縣的人，就不能　懂得了，後來全國的文字，必定彼此不同，這不是一種大障碍嗎？……」</p>
<p>何先生的話，並非毫無見地而云然的，也並非特別有所厚於古人而有所薄於今人，實在覺得要求文字能統一，最好就要在文字本身上力减通行的隊碍，寫別字，是文字統一的最大障碍。何先生說，添許多別字，別省別縣的人將不能懂得，我以爲不但別省別縣的人將不能懂得，恐怕各個人寫各個人的別字，其結果，一人一樣寫法，兩人通信，也不能互相了解！最近我接到一位初中同學的信，自頭至尾，長長四大張，不知他說些什麽，因爲他用了許多別字，夾雜一些方言，猜了半天，還是莫明其妙，我眞爲這一般可憐的靑年孩子們若急！</p>
<p>我的偏見以爲不知道別之所以爲別的不通人，固然應該對於寫別字，力加改正；知道別之所以爲別的所謂通人，尤其應該對於別字，絕對禁止，以免淆惑靑年的視聽，使文字不能統一。不通的人，無意寫別字，還可原諒；至於所謂通人者，若有意寫出別字，以自矜淵博，實在是不可原諒的。須知古人寫別字，有時因口頭傳授的關係，實在是不得已而爲之，我們生在今日的人，原不必去學它，也不可去學它。不知「勸世人莫讀古書」（註二）的曹先生，何以要抬出許「死字」來代替「活字」？（按曹先生所舉出「鞠花從此不須開」的例子，原是諧聯，固不必說，至於「鞠有黃花」的鞠字，早已就成了死字了）。</p>
<p>（註一）胡樸安先生有「別字不應該寫」一文，載十五日民報。（註二）曹先生有一篇「勸世人莫讀古書」的文章，在讀書生活上發表。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c236">廢除納妾制度後的補救方法 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 秋雲</p>
<p>前日立法院例會，審議刑法施行法草案第九條時，大起爭議，該條文爲「刑法第二三九條之規定，於刑法施行前，非配偶而以永久共同生活爲目的，有同居之關係者，不適用之。」主張規定本條者，謂是補救新刑法施行前已納妾者之辦法，免得老姨太太無人養活，主張删去此條者，謂此條規定，明明是保護納妾，民法條文，旣可救濟，加入此條，不啻書蛇添足。</p>
<p>兩派所論，似各有理由，但愚則贊成後說，因爲法律不溯旣往，原是施行法律的普通定例，故法律的效力，必於法律公佈後，方始發生，如此新刑法雖有第二三九條的規定，亦必俟新刑法公佈後，方能發生效力，新刑法未公佈前的舊賬，本來一槪不算，此無待贅言者。惟此案經主席付表决後，贊成刪去者僅有三人，大約聞女子欲秘密結合，勾引男子，或恐太太聯合控告姨太太，免得一塲淘氣耳。</p>
<p>現在我所欲說的，原不在此而在彼。納妾制度，雖已廢除，而事實並沒有廢除者，所在多有，正欲補救新刑法施行前已納妾者之辦法，便可以開後來納妾者方便之門，例如新刑法公佈以後所納之妾，於賣身契上，儘可以倒塡年月，常局者安能一一爲之根究乎，並且現在離婚案件，日見增多，雖不盡關於納妾制度的廢除，而納妾制度的廢除，多少與離婚案件有關，從前有婦之夫，倘另有所歡，不是爲小，便是爲大，（俗所謂兩頭大）現在旣主張一夫一妻之制，勢必離了前妻，方能再討後妻，男子離了婚，可以再娶，原是不成問題，而女子再醮，到是一件難事，不是如危文繡之位尊而多金，便是如阮玲玉之色藝雙絕，方有出路，否則殆矣。</p>
<p>更自廢除納妾之令公佈後，少而無妻，原屬無碍，老而無妻，便是一件困苦的事，貧乏者旣無法擺布，富有者亦擇配爲難，非如熊鳳凰，張海若，齊燮元，的地位優越之流，方有虛榮心的女子，前來侍執巾櫛，所倒霉者，惟幾位五綹長鬚耳，否則孰肯作乾癟老頭兒的配偶耶，並且討得起小老婆的人，必定豐衣足食，而甘爲小星的女子，必定爲生活鞭子所逼迫，不得已而出此，不是小家的璧玉，便是甕牖的丫環，若不爲人妾，則富者旣不願娶，而貧者又不能娶，貧家女子，又少一條出路矣。</p>
<p>廢除納妾制度，實爲人道主義，雖屬甚善，却不幸因此而引起許多麻煩，此亦立法者始料所不及此，此亦廢除納妾制度後，所當注意補救者也。</p>

<p>— 小紅</p>
<p>現在已是夜深了，那座小檯鐘剛敲過二下，但是我非常的興奮，一些兒沒有倦態，我簡直忘記了現在是應該睡覺的時候了。</p>
<p>或許是酒的力量在作怪吧？吃晚飯的時候，和幾個朋友喝了一杯酒——僅僅的一杯——以後又到一位朋友家裏去談了一會天，等回到家，已過了十二點鐘了，一直到現在，我還是非常的興奮，沒來由的流了好幾次淚。</p>
<p>或許，你會笑我太軟弱吧，沒來由的流什麼淚，一切事情是决不會流淚就可以解决的。</p>
<p>要是你眞的這麼說，或是這麽想。那麽，我要大聲的告訴你：流淚，那决不是我的軟弱的表現，不是我上面已經說過嗎，這是沒來由的，因爲我根本沒感到悲哀，雖然我現在的情緒自己也知道並不怎麼好，但是這决不是悲哀，决不是悲哀！你知道嗎？</p>
<p>我有許多話想同你說，但是，我不知道應該先向這說什麽好，呀，我的情感太衝動了，我先向你說什麽好呢？</p>
<p>是的，我還是先向你說我那天來看你的動機罷，給了你的信，你好幾天沒有給我答復，（往常不是很快的就有回信嗎？）於是我追想起我那封信的內容，我想，或許是我得罪了你了吧，悞會了我的意思，以爲我把你看得太輕了。但是，不嗎？我的朋友！在我們苦悶的時候，在我們憂鬱的時候，我們是應該理智的地的來互相鼓勵的，說那樣憂鬱的感傷的話，不是更使我們憂鬱傷感？</p>
<p>不過，我終以爲因爲這樣就引起了友誼上的悞會，是要不得的，所以，我特地離了來預備向你解釋，說得誇張些，打算向你謝罪。</p>
<p>但是結果我終於沒有向你說出來，因爲我從你的言談間，我知道你還是從前那樣，並沒有悞會我的意思。</p>
<p>近來的生活遝是如此，每天玩，也每天做事，因爲生活造成了我更堅强的意思，我每天自己訓練自己，我每天鞭策我自己，使自己不陷於頹毁的泥沼中，我儘可能的去找尋快樂，雖然快樂是時常的找不到，並且常常帶了一肚子的惆悵一肚子的悲哀回來，但是回到家來看到案頭的工作日記，我的堅强的意志又重復抬起頭來，我覺得，越是社會對我無情，我越是該更堅强更艱苦的生存下去，要是有人碰我一下汗毛，我只得回敬它重重的一拳，何况，在這社會下，你我這般遭遇的，或者甚至於還不如我的，芷多着呢，爲了自己，也爲了和我同命運的，我難道就這麼容易的頹廢下去，消極下去嗎？</p>
<p>朋友，像你所說的！好像眞的和我疏淡了開去了，但是這决不會引起我的悲觀來，他們不了解我，漸漸的疏淡了開去，那原是必然的，眞像我對待他們一樣，因爲我不能了解他們，自然我們之間的始是越走越開，越離越遠了。</p>
<p>自然，朋友能够了解我的，說起來也可說是很不少，但是這所謂了解，究竟是百分之幾呢？至多，他們了解我的祇是一些輪廓，或者，甚至於運輪廓都有些糢湖，</p>
<p>爲了這樣，我忍不住悽淸，（尤其是在這孤月當空，萬籟俱寂的環境中）。便提起筆來寫信給你，因爲我以爲，你對我的了解，至少是輪廓是認淸楚了的。</p>
<p>朋友中間在最近正鬧着不少悲劇，我雖然是一個旁觀者，但是這些陰影時常會氣上我的心來，使我起了無限的無名的惆悵。</p>
<p>在現社會下的每個靑年，正是太苦悶了。</p>
<p>現在已經三點半鐘了，我想我應該趕快睡覺纔對，因爲明天早晨還得有事情去幹呢，雖然到現在我還是那麽興奮，一些兒沒戚到倦，躺到床上去也一准得失眠，但是我得睡了。</p>
<p>可能的話，很想有個機會和你長談一下。</p>
<h3 id="c238">一個憂鬱底女人 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>爲了愛戀一些海景，所以我每天淸晨總要踏着那迷人底軟霧，走到那海灘上去，坐在一塊平正底雲母石上，看着赤丹般底朝旭，緩緩地從東方的地平線下昇起來，把海面全煊染得血紅；那罩在海上底晨霧却漸漸地斂收了。</p>
<p>我獨自個兒坐在海邊底石上，翻閱着一本小說，一壁傾聽着澎湃的濤聲，細細地咀嚼着我這孤獨底心境，和回憶着如夢般底往事。——這樣二年以來，無論是冬或夏，我從沒有一天不到過，除非要在雨天，纔我會悵惘地給阻在屋子裏。</p>
<p>二年如一日，每天到這兒來消磨一個寂寞底早晨；許多書本都在這裏從我手中一本一本的翻過去。在兩個月以前，這海灘上忽然出現了一個女人，估量上去約莫有二十多歲，臉色是慘白得像一張白紙。不過從她底裝束上看起來，至少她是一位貴族化底摩登少婦。她每天總挾着一隻皮篋，拖着個沉重底步子，蹣跚地沿着海灘走去，有時坐在臨海的一塊石上，一聲不響的，默默地看着一疊一疊　浪花向灘邊滾來，讓海風把她底修髮吹得飄呀飄的，像在沉思些什麽？</p>
<p>憔悴不能遮盡她底美麗，然而美麗却也掩不住她底憂鬱；一種內心的悲哀時常會在她那輕微底嘆息聲中流露着的。她天天這樣，並不對我瞥一眼，彷彿沒有感覺到這海灘上還有一個我在。</p>
<p>她到底時間好像比我早，當我每天六點鐘到那海灘上時，她早已在那兒躑躅着或默坐着了；回去的時候大概總八點過後。有一天，我爲被好奇心底驅策，所以等她走後，我便跟在她後面，準備去一探秘奧的；可是纔抹了兩個彎，她像似知道我特爲跟她，她就回過頭來</p>
<h3 id="c239">恐佈 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 掃白作</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>丟了我一個鄙夷的眼光，那不由得使我旋轉身子就逃了、彷彿似一個給猛獸戰敗的探險家，回到了家裏，自己很懊悔，爲什麼這樣冐昧；或許她會疑心我不懷好意，明天不再敢到這海灘上來了。我這一夜差不多整夜沒有闔眼，儘把思想浸沉在好奇和懷疑底拽索和探求裏</p>
<p>——她底舉止多神秘呵！可爲什麼這們鬱抑呢？</p>
<p>——她該有一個男人呢？不，也許她已是一朶被棄在道傍底殘花了！</p>
<p>——她的家庭决不會是一個饔餐不繼的啊！</p>
<p>——或許她是一個盡世味底可憐人兒呢！</p>
<p>——是的，她一定是個肺病底患者啊！</p>
<p>這些問題儘在我腦子裏旋迥，但是始終找不出一個妥當底答案來。</p>
<p>第二天我照例地到那兒海灘上去，但她却仍舊先我而在了：並且依然像平日一樣，似乎把昨天底事忘　了。倒是我很有些兒侷促不安，滿想趨前去向她致歉可又不敢造次，生怕弄巧成拙，惹出岔子來，因此終於沒有勇氣。就是幾次底要想去向她一詢身世，或者我能够設法安慰她，勸解她，然而也終於沒有。‘</p>
<p>現在這海灘上已經一星期多沒有她的踪跡了；不過我還是天矢去的。那兒底海灘，浪花，章地，東方朝旭，和迷樣底軟霧……一切依舊郝麽偉大，那麽美麗，甚至那麽靜寂：可是那個憂鬱底人兒呢？她飛到那裏去了哪！</p>
<h3 id="c240">母親 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>母親今年已經是六十歲了！我在母親五十四歲那年就離開了可愛的故鄉，現在已整整的六個年頭沒有看到我年邁的老母了。</p>
<p>六年的生活，將我磨練得異常蒼老了！好像自己不曾有過天眞活潑的童年似的：我現在變得寡言笑，見了最親熱的朋友也不過問問寒熱；呌呌跳跳的孩童習氣，已經不能在我身上找到絲毫，雖然有時我自己很想振作一番，跟着一班和我年紀相彷的同伴來玩一陣。</p>
<p>六年的時光，是多麽的悠長啊！生活在失業漩渦中的我更容易體味到。</p>
<p>在我離開家庭的那年，母親的頭上已經是白髮斑斑的了：現在呢，大約快透頂白了吧。</p>
<p>家中的來信，總是說鄉下遭了水旱災和兵災；每當接到這樣的一對家書時，我的一顆曾經被生活創傷，被愁絲纏住的憂鬱的心：更被這一聲絕啼似的家書而難受了！在我已有的創痕上更加上了深深的一條。往往，我總是在一陣呆然木立之後，不自覺的倒在床上微微的啜泣起來！母親的影子，更像迅電一般的在我的腦袋裏閃來閃去：</p>
<p>一個圓圓的貧血臉孔，一說到沒有辦法好想的事情就將雙眉鎖成了一綫，嘴緊閉着，肌肉一躍一躍的顫動……這是我所能記憶的母親的糢糊輪廓。</p>
<p>我現在能够憶到母親在六年以前將她嬌生慣養足不出戶的幼兒送到數千里的上海找哥哥時的窘態，我知道母親的心是比一把鋒利的尖刀挿進去還要難受！還要慘痛！</p>
<p>從我出走的那年起，由母親的來信中，知道家中是一年不如一年了！第二年，母親連粥也沒得吃，才被二姊接了去，直到現在，在二姊家已整整的五個年頭了？</p>
<p>二姊當然沒什麽話，因爲到底是自己的生身母啊！可是姊夫却不同了，常常背着母親說壞話。母親的耳朶又不聾，不久這種流言就侵入了她老人家的耳中？</p>
<p>有着一個異常對建的頭腦，（在平日他總是說除了兒子外不靠任何人養活！）而且且在平日抱着「萬事不求人」的宗旨的母親，這一，種有生以來未受過的刺戟她怎麽受得了呢？</p>
<p>我彷彿看到一個癟着嘴的老太婆，散着花白的頭髮溺在海中滿面是淚，用人類最凄慘的哀鳴向我乞援—那就是我的母親—但我自己又是一個不會泳水的可憐虫，眼看着慘白的腦袋向下沉去，祇有幾絲白髮在水面揚了幾揚就消沉了……。</p>

<h3 id="c241">幾個「手頭字」的商榷 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在「五四」以後，人們爲了應用上的便利，就積極來提倡比較淺近的白話文以代替奧深的文言文。現在又爲了寫習上的便利，便又有「手頭字」的推行。可見文化的發展完全是由於時代的演進，以及大衆的需要而來，並是偶然產生的。</p>
<p>關於「手頭字」的便利，已由編者先生說過，我不必多說了。不過我對於手頭字却有一個疑問，特提出來，想請提倡這種字體的先生們給我一個解釋。</p>
<p>手頭字的字彙已由推行會選出三百字，以後再繼續發表。不過在這三百個手頭字中，有幾個字尙欠簡便，譬如「馬」字，爲什麼不寫作「馬」呢？「縣」字，爲什麽不寫作「　」字呢？「疊」字爲什麽不寫作「壘」字呢？還有「癮」字爲什麽不寫作「流」字呢？我覺得「馬」字的四點改作「一」字，似乎便利得多了。「疊」字改作「壘」字，「縣」字改作「　」字，「癮」字改作「疣」字，大衆都能看得懂，而且在習慣上也很普遍，何以不就簡便呢？所以特提出來藉供大家的討論。也許我的意見有點錯誤？或是有特別原因吧？務請他們給我一個指示，免我和其他讀者懷疑下去。專上，並請撰安　　余放敬上</p>
<p>編者按：余君對於手頭字能够這樣詳細的研究它，並且還提出幾個意見來，像這種研究的精神，實在可佩。</p>
<p>對於他的意見；我們很爲贊同，因爲手頭字旣以簡便爲目的，那末當然要採取更簡便的字體。不通有一點余君要了解：就是手頭宇雖取其簡便，便也要注意是否普遍應用的問題。同時手頭字木過是推行而已，並不是製造。像余君所說的「馬」字「壨」字和「昙」字已經有很多人在應用，當然有採入的必要，但「　）字的寫法却很少見，我想一般人恐怕是很少認識的吧？旣不普遍暫時就不能算它是一個「手頭字」了。</p>
<p>我們知道，無論做件什麽事，在初創的時候，總有點疏忽的地方，必須輕過多方的政良，才可以達到完美的地步。我們要手頭字向前進展，當然也要有逐漸的改良。所以我們希望各讀者對於手頭字應加以深切的探討，並且要像余君一樣，隨時貢獻自己的意見；同時，我們又希望各讀者把自己所知道的，而未採入那三百字中的簡筆字，隨時寫來，本欄當釋要發表，以作那些負責提倡的先生們的參考及採用。</p>

<p>開幕的一天，哈得福的市長，建築協會，建築材料商人，都來參加，參觀的人不限於哈得福城內，就是四郊也都遠這而來，因爲報紙方面事前有過宣傳，所以參觀的人比衆來得多，展覽的那天，報館方面，更不惜犧牲巨大的篇幅，以刋載建築界的文字和消息，而且哈得福報向來每星期六有一次建築特刋，儘量的闢出幾版刋載使居室現代化和建築地產裝飾物等文字，建築學會方面，同時更在有經騐，有能力的人合作之下，從事一次切實的調査工作，結果獲得很多有價値的報告，足以促進建築的，調査時間展長至六個星期，所得的報告，其中最有價値的，便値的，便是有很多要造住宅的人，有的人心理要想建造住宅，但沒有計劃，說是馬上要進行規劃了，有的人說經濟力量很能够建築住宅，有的人要加入學會研究一些建築學識。</p>
<p>哈得福泰晤士報覺得有很多人要研究建築學、因此，便把建築物的模型由中層移到最高的一層，使其和衛市完全隔絕，而這間屋子裏面，預備舉行各種集都大會，在晚間，也有在午後畢行的，加入研究的不取任何費用，這樣便可使一般的人都有機會研究建築學術，學會的裏面，更裝有一間電力的廚房，預備一星期烹飪一次或一次以上，更有各種遊戲，加入的會員，至少有一百五十人至二百人，這個建築學會，成立之初，遠在一九二八年，一九二九年而後各種工作，更說意進行，回想起來，當初哈得福泰晤士報蒐得或借用若干建築物的照片，更把舊的住宅攝了照片，刋在報紙上面，指出這種房屋，應如何改進，如何使其現代化，消息傳出之後，第一個星期大增加建築特刋之時，便有好多營造廠，建築材料工廠，和經售建築材料的人刋登廣告，連同文字佔去了七版，在一九二九年全年之中，每次星期六發刋之時，佔去十二版，幅，有時竟增加到十六版。裏面除了廣告之外，更利有很多有價値的文字和照片，從此以後，哈得福泰晤士報對於建業和建築學，始終極端的注意着呢。</p>

<p>（四）再閉之，使爐溫低降，而取出熟鐵。</p>
<p>（五）傾去雜渣，倒入型槽，而切成長條，或其他形狀。</p>
<p>第三節　熟鐵之性能及應用　　（一）熟鐵因切過成條，故内部有纖維之組織，其方向與切向同。：熟鐵若於小泥板上擊之，其聲甚濁，斯則爲與鋼聲相異之點。</p>
<p>熟鐵不易生銹，故多用作水管材料。</p>
<p>熟鐵之能力，不及鋼料遠甚。</p>
<p>熟鐵之市塲，亦以噸擔論，其價當較貴於生鐵也。</p>
<p>第四章　鋼</p>
<p>第一節　什麼是鋼</p>
<p>以由鐵礦練得之生鐵，再加鍜練，於是得鋼，其原理，僅須將生鐵中所含之雜質淸除燒去，而另外加以各種需要之質料已耳。至於練鋼方法有Open-bearth法，Bessemer氏法，炭化法，鍋練法，及電爐法等。茲分述如後：</p>
<p>第二節　Open　heath練鋼法</p>
<p>是法爲直接由生鐵練鋼之一法；其所用原料除生鐵外，尙有廢鋼與鐵礦兩物，故市上有專收爛鋼鐵，卽係此用。以三物同放爐內，以烈火燒之,乃一同受溶，而鐵礦中之氧氣自動散出，以吸收生鐵及廢鋼中之雜質，使得純鋼.</p>
<p>練製之步驟：爐壁四面，須用含鎂鈣質之鹼性磚塊砌就，當應用時，先將生鐵鐵礦及廢鋼，堆入爐中，另加石炭石，乃引火燄及空氣入內，歷七八小時後，硫燐等質，可去凈，而碳質亦已達最低量，於是加入少量之錳鐵礦砂，使保持碳量，不致流失，而驅去過多之氣氣，開小門使鋼液外流，入模型，可得鋼塊，經機器，可隨意輾成鋼板，軋成鋼條，現今龍華上海練鋼廠之製法，卽用上述，惟出品僅足供給軍部應用，尙不及外消而普及於建築界也。</p>
<p>至上述所以墻壁之用鹼質，以生鐵及鐵礦中多含燐質，爲有害鋼質之物，必須去掉，故用之使除去燐質。若有鐵礦中不含燐質者，可用平常矽質泥磚砌之，蓋成本可節省不少，而鎂磚係極貴者也。</p>
<p>第三節　Bessmer氏鍊鋼法</p>
<p>俾士墨氏法之鍊鋼，與上法不同，上法將雜質用鐵礦提去，而此法僅將生鐵用火力燒去其所含之雜質，當生　中雜質燒凈之後，乃加入適量之碳質於是成鋼。</p>
<p>鍊製之步驟：爐中先放生鐵半爐，於爐底用　筒以每方吋二十磅之壓力將空氣打進。空氣中之氧氣，因高溫度而與生鐵中之矽鎂等物化合，可有黃色火熖外現，再燒而生鐵中之碳質每受氧化，熖變白色，此時卽示人以不可再燒，否則生鐵亦就感受氧化。卽此中斷空氣之供給，而稍加碳質或錳，而成鋼料。</p>
<p>第四節　炭化法</p>
<p>是爲古式豭鍊高等鋼料之方法，惟甚耗費，其鍜鍊也概不攙雜他物，而僅爲加磯質一視，故曰磯化法：</p>
<p>鍊製之步驟，以熟鐵成棍狀，置炭粉小箱中，用華一千五百度至一千八百度之溫，悶燒數日，當時每二十小時，鐵內可收入碳質六分之一英吋，待其成功出箱，漸漸使之冷却，卽可應用。</p>
<p>第五節　鍋鍊法</p>
<p>鍋鍊法亦爲高等鋼料鍜鍊法之一，亦用悶燒，唯較前法爲新式耳，其較前法爲　速優良？初亦以熟鐵置預放相當碳質之石墨製鉗鍋中，密不透空氣內入，而鍋約可盛鐵重七十五至一百磅；用烈火燒五小時，鐵乃溶解而與碳混合成鋼，自鍋中傾出，倒入模內，可供市用</p>

<h3 id="c249">談水泥 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>古時羅馬人已經知道用火山灰和石灰研細混拌後，加水拌和，漸漸可以凝成固體。這種古董的水泥，直到現在還是很堅固而且很完美的保留在許多地方。現在市上的水泥，實在也不過用鼓風爐爐渣和石灰磨和起來而成。在中國因爲鋼鐵製造尙未發達，我們是用粘土來代替鼓風爐爐渣。這種製造法和羅馬人的方法，其實完全一樣。</p>
<p>水泥的成分。普通說來是氧化鈣，三氧化二鋁，二氧化矽，三氧化鐵，氧化鎂等，不過牠們都是在化合的狀態。這許多氧化物的結合，從化學分析上我們得不到什麽結論，因此這一個問題，從賴齊太里Lo　Chatlier以來五十年中，始終都成學者爭辯的一個問題。根據各家的學說，我們可以大膽地說一聲，水泥中含有　　　　　　　及少計的　　　　氧化鎂通常都不再和其他東西結合了。假如我們祇管中種氧化物，而不再差距牠們間相互的結合，那末水泥的成分，可用下表示之。</p>
<p>氧化鈣　百分之六十三</p>
<p>三氧化二鋁百分之六·五</p>
<p>二氧化　　百分之二十一·五</p>
<p>三氣化鐵　百分之二·五</p>
<p>氧化鎂　百分之二·五</p>
<p>三氧化硫　百分之一·五</p>
<p>水泥的製造，有乾法和濕法兩種。濕法通行於歐洲。乾法是比較新的方法，是美國人所發明的。這兩種方法是大同小異。　濕法中，石灰石和粘土用水拌和，然後再磨細，焙成小塊。乾法中，原料先烘乾再磨細，再焙成小塊。焙時溫度約在攝氏一四〇〇度至一六〇〇度光景。這時，這些原料在半融鎔的狀態，因爲是在旋轉爐內烘焙的，所以這些半镕的東西，就互相膠住，幾成胡桃大小的硬塊，經冷却後，這些硬塊用機器磨細，優得到水泥了。製造水泥用的旋轉爐是很長很大的圓管平放着。這圓管的直徑，大約七呎至九呎光景，長有一二百呎。牠轉動的速度很慢，大約每一分鐘或二分鐘轉一轉。</p>
<p>以上概述一些水泥的常識，下面我預備講一些近年來關於水泥研究之趨勢</p>
<p>近年來，水泥凝固時發熱的現象，已引起絕大的注意。據但維及福克斯之實騐，巨大的三和土建築，如壩，堤，橋墩等，在凝固時，溫度竟能升高攝氏五十或七十度者。此種建築物當其溫度漸次冷却時，水泥業已凝固，但物體熱則漲冷則縮，水泥在冷却時，旣已凝結堅固，所以就因收縮而生裂縫要避免建築上之裂縫，水泥之放熱量必使之降低。據最近試驗，此種所放熱量，以鋁酸化三鈣為最大，　酸化三鈣次之，而　酸化二鈣為最小。是以今日建築界上對於性質優美而放熱量少之水泥，非常企望</p>
<p>水泥之已凝固者，如遇海水或酸溶液後，所受侵蝕究若何，此亦今日之一大問題也。</p>
<p>硫酸鈉，硫酸鉀，硫酸鎂，硫酸鈣等溶液，均能侵蝕三和土，其程度則視此硫酸　類之　度及三和土之狀况而定。普通，水泥中之氫氧化鈣，與酸作用而成硫酸鈣，而含水鋁酸鈣則成硫鋁酸鈣Calcium　Sulpbo　aluminate此二作用均能使三和土發漲而崩解。硫酸鎂溶液中，作用更烈。因和狀態，此時其FH値爲十·五，較維持含水矽酸鈣在穩定狀態時所需者，不足甚多，因此含水矽　鈣遂生水解，生成若干之氫氧化鈣，此新生之氫氧化鈣再與硫酸鎂作用，生出硫酸鈣及氫　化鎂，溶液中之痊氧化鎂，繼續在飽和狀態，故含水　酸鈣繼續水解不已。此處作用，周而復始，循環不已，直至三和土小孔中積滿氫氧化鎂之沈澱，使作用遲緩，漸趨停止。狀水泥已被蝕甚烈，漸呈鬆散了。</p>
<p>三和土之須受海水或酸類侵蝕者，構築時應選用特種水泥，如含　水泥等，即可較為耐用。</p>

<h3 id="c250">創立阮玲玉演技獎金芻議 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 旭東</p>
<p>阮玲玉的慘死，已給與熱心中國電影的人們莫大的傷痛。這因爲阮玲玉的死，乃是中國電影界的損失。由於她的自殺，人們不會忘懷一年前艾霞的自殺。於是人們不免感傷的說：電影演員的自殺，相繼成風，爲了中國電影今後之成長，不能不盡力的將這不良的風氣遏止下去。進一步說，阮玲玉的死，不能不給與人們不良的影響，當這苦悶的時代，當怯　的人們在苦悶中掙扎　的人們可怕的暗示的話，那末這不能不更是値得我們憂悒的了。何况靑年自殺的消息，在報章上經常不斷的發現，雖然這未必　是阮玲玉的影響。</p>
<p>因着阮玲玉自殺在艾霞之後，使人們熱烈的探求着中國電影女演員如此怯懦的原因。記得本刋「悼阮玲玉女士」一文，曾經指出了她的死因：由於精神生活的向上和物質生活向上的矛盾，她不能在這矛盾中求得適當的解抉，卽是說她不能脫除這矛盾的苦痛，她不能勇敢的犧牲個人的享樂而獻身於偉大的前途，於是她怯懦的自殺了。更有人正確的指出，艾霞的死，是因着不能從資本主義的現階段走向新的前途，而阮玲玉却是不能像易卜生的娜樣，從小松鼠的地位得看現階段應有的社會人的地位。</p>
<p>那末由於這慘酷的教訓，我們應當從對於一個藝人之死的惋惜，從對於社會惡勢力的憤恨，燃燒起憤恨的火炬，在黑夜中勇敢的吶喊着向光明的前途邁進。特別是電影演員們，更應當從這一慘變市覺醒過來，深切的認識現實，更正確的認識歷史决定意義的前途。然後將自己的認識和信心，通過電影藝術發揚光大。同時將私人生活極力單純化，樸素化，科學化，以畢生精力從事藝術的奮鬥。祇有這樣，才有偉大的藝術前途，祗有這樣，才是眞實的從阮玲玉的慘死中得着了寶貴的敎訓而勇敢的實踐，也祇有這樣，方是最有意義的紀念阮玲玉了。</p>
<p>當然，我們敢說阮玲玉是値得紀念的，但是似乎不是鑄一個銅像就可了事的，所需要的是超過形式上的紀念，成爲一般演員從生活和藝術上的有力的鼓勵。卽是說從生活的改變到演技的努力，作爲最眞實的紀念。因而在此有創立阮玲玉演技獎金的提議。</p>
<p>我們知道，在外國都有各種學術獎金，有名的諾貝爾獎金便是好例，而在美國關於電影的獎金會，也是每年舉行年獎的存在着。但是在中國，是項組織，尙付缺如，這不能不說我們社會人士對電影還沒有深刻的關切。現是在原則方面，演藝獎金之實現，人們大概不會如何反對，因爲這無論如何有帮助於中國電影的進步。可是當阮玲玉死後的現在，我們認爲這種獎金，更有意義和必要。如上所述，電影演員如欲在演技上有着偉大的成就，必須深切的體念現實，同時更需要將個人生活的慾求和藝術活動之間的矛盾，儘量的减少以至於消滅，換言之，將整個的身體從事於藝術的勞働，完全獻身於藝術的前途。進一步說，生活和意志决不能有矛盾的存在，一個眞正爲社會人羣服務的演員，一定得從生活上鍜鍊着刻苦耐勞的精神。整天沉淪於麋爛生活或巒愛糾紛之中，决不能在藝術上得看偉大的成就。如若生活和意志完全統一，如若藝術探討提高於生活的慾念，那末因着個人的苦悶而且殺，决不會偶然發生了。不消說，光榮的獎金應當爲眞正努力於電影藝藝術的人們所獲得。這種榮　鼓勵，對於中國電影的進步，一定是很有幫助的。</p>
<p>不過更得懇切的說明，這種獎金，最好能眞從社會中得來，必定要從為了關心中國電影而惋情玩玲玉之死的人羣中得來，才有更大的意義。至於　集多少基金，以及用何種方法來籌集，如何保營，以及如何選　得獎者等等，都要等待着讀者諸君——特別是電影從　員諸君，提出寶貴的意見，這裏不過是一個芻議而已。</p>

<p>The　Man　Who　Reclaimed　His　Head</p>
<p>—大上海—</p>
<p>爲了將本片介紹給上海觀衆，這裏須將整個的故事簡單的叙述一下。</p>
<p>字慕上映着「巴黎—一九一五」字樣，展開在畫面上的是德國空軍夜　巴黎。警笛的亂吹，探空燈的照射，飛機的轟炸，全城的燈光全熄。在緊張的空氣之中，一個靑年主人公戎裝抱其幼女并提一皮箱，蹌踉的叩其舊時同學，現爲律師的家門。相見之下，主人公眼淚盈眶的追述他的往事：</p>
<p>這靑年主人公名萬林，爲一　途潦　的　作家　　　一次世界大戰　　　前一年，他偕其愛妻幼女居於巴黎的僻靜之處。在一個狂歡節的晚上，新聞巨頭譚孟來訪萬林，請他代作時事論文，署名譚孟，萬林初不應允，認爲這是不當的行爲。可是生活逼迫着他，再加上渴慕生活舒適之妻的勸誘，他開始爲譚撰作論文。萬林素主和平，便發表反對戰爭，鼓吹和平的言論，因此譚孟之名，便爲全國人民熟烈的擁護，萬林這時除了生活美滿之外，精神上也覺得甚爲安慰。同時萬林之妻也有機會偕譚孟在　貴的交際塲中出入了，那美麗的音樂和舞蹈，使她深深的沉醉。</p>
<p>但是因爲報紙上的反戰論調過高，一方面固使人民興奮，同時却急壞了一般軍火商人，因爲他們是企圖在戰爭之中漁利的。於是軍火商人給譚孟以巨資，使他　非戰爲鼓吹戰爭的論調，當然這對於卑鄙的譚孟正中下懷，本來他就是以　評　謀利之途的。繁是他便突然改變態度，乘機主張戰爭，當萬林去質問他的時候，他的理由是爲了國家，爲了愛護祖國。正因爲譚孟之名素爲人們欽仰的原故，所以他這種主張，也激動了盲從的國民參戰的狂熱，萬林偶然提出反戰的主張，反遭羣衆痛毆　。而這時候譚孟　在軍艦中和軍火商人們計議發財了。</p>
<p>大戰爆發，萬林被徵調上前綫，不消說，他嘗盡了戰爭的痛苦，同時在家中的妻女，對於他的懷念，也是十分悲慘的：當妻接到了丈夫的來信，小女兒要求母親讀信給她聽的時候，那慘痛的沉重，不能不使人爲之下淚。在火車站中，萬林在讀着家書的時候，忽聽得從前目擊他的愛妻和譚孟在戲院中之親　狀態的人，談及譚孟的種種，甚至於他不能請假回家，也是譚孟的搗鬼，於是他憤怒之下逃回巴黎，那正是德機　炸巴黎之夜，在戰爭的恐怖之中，他回到家裏，恰好看見譚孟在强吻他的愛妻，於是他瘋狂的殺了他，併割下他的首級，携其愛女到了律師家裏了。</p>
<p>故事說到這裏爲止，他請律師爲他辯護，律師鳴官將他捉去，妻亦趕來，相對痛哭，可是律師却答應給他極力辯護的了。　　在這一故事中，很明白的可以看出幾點最有價値的地方，那便是原舞台劇的作者Jean　Bart對於戰爭之本質的認識。第一次大戰的主使者，正是軍火商人之流的資本家，爲了擴充與分割殖民地市塲，爲了銷售他們的軍火，他們是需要戰爭的。同時帝國主義的新聞主持者流，他可以投機的以反戰的論調以獲得讀者的歡心，（雖然他們可以不必，執筆有錢便可以購買最高的聲譽，這是所謂名流學者的本色·）可是當他們的和資本家取得密切聯繫的時候，愛護　國便成爲他們最好的藉口的而純樸的讀者們，在最高的　譽之下，當已經獲得他們之信仰的時候，這欺騙的效力乃是極大的了。關於這種本質的解說，便確立了作品成功的基礎。此外側面的配襯着名流學者之道德上的卑污與生活的淫靡，正面的描寫戰爭的殘酷，更加重了劇的效果，雖然我們也得指出個人英雄主義，爲公憤爲私仇的懲　除奸，並不是反對帝國戰爭正當的辦法。</p>
<p>就電影的編劇技巧來說，我們似乎可以指出：對於萬林在戰塲中殘酷的種種，很少描寫，不免减輕了刺戟的力量。至於回意法的叙述，一方面固然可以避免主人公殺人之後，緊接在律師家中沉痛的種種，劇的空氣難於啣接，另一方面主要的故事，一步逼一步的緊張空氣，也並沒有失掉。不過也許人們會感覺若干程度的沉悶，然而這决不能說的是導演Fdward　Ludwig的失敗，相反的他是嚴肅的電影藝術的處理了他的出品。至於主角克勞特萊恩斯的演技，（Claude　Rains）在「法網情絲」（Grime　Without　Passion中，他飾一個極奸險的惡律師，已經大露光芒，現在這裏　是一個完全相反的正義威的靑年，又是非常盡職的，他的前途，眞是無可限量了。</p>

<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂許多親近的朋友都覺得這件事件突梯滑稽，勸，不要答應，但是瑪格勒蒂，像那寫信給她的人一樣，是個見解各別的人。她自己决定了自己的前途。克萊夫亦好似深知瑪格勒蒂似的，他自從寫信之後，就天天盼望着他的蒞臨印度。他並不愁她不來，他所愁的是怎樣在她未來之前，做出一番事業。</p>
<p>這時英國砲壘濟里拿坡，已久在法軍圍困之中。那裏就是克萊夫和艾德蒙被遣送前去救援的地方，但是現在已經入於絕境了。英軍苦戰了好幾個月，無法突破法軍的重重包圍，眼看着已再不能支持了。在這樣一個希望垂絕的晚上，克萊夫和艾德蒙站在砲壘的城墻上。那城墻大概有兩丈多高，下面是一道濠溝，流着污濁的泥水，四面漆黑，僅有砲火的閃爍，可以望見一些東南西北。克萊夫望下瞰着，突然將一只脚跨過了城墻。</p>
<p>艾德蒙連忙拉住了他，駭然問道：「你做什麽」？克萊夫咬着牙道：「我去求救兵去。這樣怎麼了呢」？艾德蒙道：「你揎奪職守，是要被槍斃的」！克萊夫推開了艾德蒙的手道：「我不走，我們大家都要槍斃的」。說時遲，那時快，他那隻腳已經跨過去了。他蹲在城牆上，作欲躍之狀。艾德蒙喊道：兩丈多高你怎麽跳呀」？克萊夫兩手攀着城墻，兩隻脚已經懸空了。艾德蒙急道：「怎麽報告長官呢」？在砲火一瞥之中，艾德蒙看見克萊夫習慣的獰笑，他說道：「叫他堅持到底，等我回來」，他說完了，身體已經下去。。</p>
<p>在聖大街砲壘中的議事廳裏，總督畢各德正開着緊急會議。一班東印度貿易公司的鉅頭，曼甯，華坡敦，潘勃頓和堪德等，都在面面相親，一籌莫展之中，然後各人左右張望着，各自不忍看別人而上表示着的絕望，威亡的慘狀，隊長克拉克送進一張最近的報告來，說英軍已處於甕中了，手下所剩的人，祇有一百二十名，大勢是無可挽回的了。，</p>
<p>忽然一個汚穢襤褸的人奔了進來。他破裂的皮靴，每走一步，裏面的泥漿就洎洎而出。身上的軍服已是千穿百孔，露出裏面泥濘污穢的皮肉。大家看了，都張大了嘴爲之駭然。曼寗第一個喊道：「克萊夫，你來幹什麽」？那人一言不發，抓到了一張椅子坐了下來，就開始刺身上的破衣服。潘勃頓怒喊道：「你做什麽？這又不是你的臥房」！克萊夫已經將上身的襯衫脫了下來，擦着他肩上的泥汗。他徐徐說道：「需要是任何人的臥房」。</p>
<p>他掉轉頭，對着克拉克隊長道：「拿些乾凈衣服來」。他又看見桌上大碗之中，還剩着一些飲料，他就傾在杯子裏，牛飲起來。他喝完了水，然後對着大家道：「諸君，你們沒有軍隊了。齊里拿坡不久就要失守了！你們呢！你們將先被劫掠一空。最後，諸君，就是慘殺，屠戮」！大家聽了，無精打彩地看着他，這是什麽新聞呢？但是畢各德總督藹然問道：「那未你有什麽建議呢」，（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Our Country Denies the Illegal Transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>A Statement to the International Community Was Released Yesterday</p>
<p>Reiterating Our Country's Position Based on the Agreement, Fully Reserving All Rights</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the illegal transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, our country has separately lodged protests with both the Soviet and Japanese sides. The preliminary agreement for the sale of the railway was recently signed in Tokyo on the 11th of this month. Our authorities have again lodged a serious protest and are also preparing a statement to be sent to all relevant countries. This statement reiterates the main points of our country's previous protests, reiterates our country's position based on the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924, and solemnly declares that the entire railway line is within Chinese territory and exists only due to a special concession granted by China. Therefore, any transfer of the railway by the Soviet government, in any form, will be regarded by China as an illegal act and an international misstep. The Chinese government fully reserves its rights in this matter. This note and statement were issued on the afternoon of the 16th. The full text of the statement is as follows: The entire Chinese Eastern Railway line is laid within Chinese territory and is a joint enterprise of the government of the Republic of China and the government of the Soviet Union. This railway is an indispensable means of transportation for the eastern provinces, and its importance is related not only to China's economic organization but also to railway transportation between Europe and Asia. The railway was granted a special concession by the Chinese government, which provided a portion of the capital for its construction. Its current status is clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Agreement signed in 1924. China, as the host country, enjoys not only the rights and interests stipulated in the treaty but also its inherent sovereignty over the railway. Article 9, Section 5 of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of May 1924 clearly stipulates that the future of the Chinese Eastern Railway can only be decided by China and the Soviet Union, and no third party is allowed to interfere. According to this agreement, the Soviet government promised the Chinese government that it could redeem the Soviet interests in the railway at any time. Furthermore, both parties agreed that after a certain period, the Soviet government must completely transfer the management of the Chinese Eastern Railway to China. Moreover, in Article 4, Section 2 of the aforementioned agreement, China and the Soviet Union mutually agreed that neither contracting party should conclude any treaty or agreement that would impair the sovereignty or interests of the other contracting party. Now, the Soviet government is conducting negotiations with the Japanese government and individuals claiming to represent the current illegal organization in Northeast China for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which is a violation of the aforementioned articles and disregards the repeated protests of the Chinese government. It is reported that these negotiations have been completed, and the railway seems to be transferred soon. The Soviet government's attempt to dispose of the Chinese Eastern Railway without China's consent is clearly an act beyond its authority. The Chinese government should regard it as absolutely illegal and invalid. The Soviet government may believe that transferring its interests in the railway to a third party is a good idea, regardless of whether that third party actually exists or is without identity. China will never recognize any party as the successor to any rights or interests in the railway. No person or organization may operate a railway within Chinese territory without China's express consent. The Soviet Union's current actions undoubtedly directly infringe upon China's treaty and sovereign rights. The Chinese government is prevented from exercising its management rights over the Chinese Eastern Railway due to circumstances not attributable to China. This regrettable fact does not affect the validity of the 1924 agreement or the status of the Chinese Eastern Railway in the slightest. Under the current circumstances, the Soviet government cannot dispose of the Chinese Eastern Railway, just as the Soviet government could not dispose of it when the Chinese and Soviet authorities actually jointly managed the railway. China's treaty and sovereign interests in the railway remain the same as before and have not changed in the slightest. The Chinese government hereby solemnly declares that the entire Chinese Eastern Railway is laid within Chinese territory and exists only due to a special concession granted by China. Any transfer of the railway by the Soviet government, whether through sale or other means, will only be regarded by the Chinese government and people as an illegal act without any binding force and as an international misstep. The Chinese government fully reserves its rights in this matter. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to a report from Miyun County, 300 soldiers and bandits from Yang Er and Feng Shou Peng's troops, who had passed through Xinglong from Yutian and were fleeing to outside the pass, were pursued and suppressed by Japanese and puppet troops stationed at Xinglong Mountain outside the Great Wall. On the afternoon of the 17th, the bandits fled again to the deep mountains of Shuang Dongzi in Xinglong, where they entrenched themselves. The Japanese and puppet troops adopted a three-sided encirclement from the east, west, and north to attack. The bandits could not withstand the pressure and appeared to be fleeing from the western mountain pass to the border of the second district in eastern Miyun. Miyun County Magistrate Zhang Weixie has ordered the second detachment leader of the Security Corps, Ren Zheng, to lead his troops to the Gouweiba Ridge area of the second district to set up defenses and block the bandits to prevent them from escaping.

<p>(Beiping) The Yunnanese Association in Beiping and the Foreign Affairs Support Association telegraphed Chairman Long of Yunnan Province on the 18th to inquire about the invasion of Mengjiao and Mengdong by British troops. According to those in charge of the association, the two Tusi of Mengjiao and Mengdong are under the jurisdiction of Gui Jing County, southeast of Ban Hong. Because the area is rich in gold mines, the British have long coveted it. It is expected that the reason for this invasion by British troops is that the troops stationed in western and southern Yunnan were recently transferred to eastern Yunnan to suppress bandits, leaving the defense of the area empty, so they took the opportunity to invade. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th). The Beijing consular residence is currently being renovated and can be moved in the short term. In the future, the Japanese ambassador will be permanently stationed in Beijing. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Puppet Organization Restricts Our Country's Farmers and Workers from Leaving the Pass; All Poor Farmers and Workers Are Prevented from Going; Railway Bureau Advises Thousands of Travelers to Be Cautious <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The method of the puppet border police team at Shanhaiguan for cracking down on laborers leaving the pass is that anyone leaving the pass will be thoroughly questioned when purchasing a puppet country entry permit at the puppet Great Eastern Company. Those who originally lived in the Northeast, have property and jobs, or can prove their affairs, are allowed to purchase a puppet country entry permit and leave the pass by train. Those who have no jobs and do not engage in production to benefit the Northeast are refused entry. Due to the prohibition of Chinese people from leaving the pass at Shanhaiguan, the number of passengers on the Ping-Shen through train has greatly decreased. On the 18th, the through train carried a total of 170 passengers from Beiping and Tianjin, several times fewer than in the past. Thousands of poor farmers and workers have gathered at Shanhaiguan Station, all of whom are blocked from leaving the pass and are hesitating whether to advance or retreat. All the hotels are also full. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After Shanhaiguan cracked down on Chinese people leaving the pass, all ports along the Great Wall, starting with fifteen, were also interrogated by international police and Japanese troops. Laborers leaving the country without jobs were prohibited from entering puppet territory. Yingkou and Dalian were also prohibited from landing, except for laborers recruited by traitors. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A recruitment agency for Chinese laborers set up by traitors in the Japanese concession in Tianjin falsely claimed to be sending people to Tanggu to build a motor road. Those recruited were imprisoned in a room and could not move freely. Those who wanted to quit were severely beaten. On the 17th, several workers escaped and reported to the authorities. The Public Security Bureau sent detectives to arrest Sun Sailu, a traitor who recruited laborers, at the border between the Chinese and Japanese concessions. The others hid in the Japanese concession and did not come out. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the puppet authorities have prohibited Chinese people from leaving the pass, Tao Shangming is still in Tianjin, waiting for Yin Rugeng to return before going to Beiping together to convene a liquidation committee to discuss the matter. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 18th, the Beining Railway Bureau issued a notice regarding the Japanese border police at Shanhaiguan prohibiting Chinese people from leaving the pass, stating that recently, many farmers and workers from various places have been going to the Northeast to seek a living, but after arriving at Shanhaiguan, they have been blocked from leaving the pass by the other side. The number of people, young and old, who are unable to advance or retreat is quite large. The situation is miserable and pitiful. It has now been clarified that the Northeast has set restrictions on our farmers and workers leaving the pass. In addition to those who have already settled in the Northeast, only farmers and workers are allowed to leave the pass, and they must have the necessary documents. For example, carpenters must bring furniture, and farmers must also bring a letter of recommendation. If they are poor farmers and workers, even if their documents are complete, they will all be blocked. Therefore, travelers leaving the pass are specially advised to pay special attention and be cautious in their actions. Do not go rashly to avoid being stranded in the middle of the journey. This is very important. This is the notice. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Military Attaché Takahashi stated that the ban on Chinese travelers leaving the pass at Yuguan is limited to farmers and workers, and ordinary travelers are not subject to this restriction. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Japanese blocking Chinese people from leaving the pass, Zhou of the Beining Railway posted a notice at various stations along the line yesterday, advising travelers to be cautious in their actions to avoid being stranded in the middle of the journey. Our side has decided to lodge a protest with the Japanese side. The Ping-Shen through train arriving in Beiping this morning was delayed for more than an hour because the axle suddenly burned out when it arrived at Liushouying. On the train arriving in Beiping, some passengers returned from Yuguan. According to reports, some of the passengers who were blocked have been released after receiving telegrams from the Northeast proving that they were allowed to pass. There are currently about 700 people stranded in Yuguan, mostly poor farmers and workers. After this incident occurred, the number of through train tickets sold at the Ping station has gradually decreased. For the Ping-Shen through train that departed last night, no first-class or second-class tickets were sold. Only 89 third-class tickets were sold. It is expected that the number of trains departing tonight will decrease even more. According to relevant sources, if the Japanese side does not lift the ban, the Oriental Travel Agency, which is responsible for the Ping-Shen through train, will also be affected. In order to facilitate traffic between inside and outside the pass, in addition to the Railway Bureau first posting a notice to travelers to be cautious in their actions, we have decided to formally protest to the Japanese side within the day in order to achieve the original meaning of restoring the Ping-Shen through train. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the Japanese side, the reasons for blocking our workers from leaving the pass are: (1) The number of workers from Shandong and Henan leaving the pass is too high, which affects the Japanese and Korean immigration to the Northeast. (2) Pu Yi is about to go to the Northeast, and the local area is under strict guard, fearing that too many workers leaving the pass will cause disturbances. It is expected that this matter will be resolved after Pu Yi returns to Changchun from Japan. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Political and Educational Integration Suited to Modern China <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Niu Yongjian's Report at the National Government Commemoration Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government's Commemoration Week was held on the morning of the 18th. Yu Youren, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Chen Daqi, Chen Qicai, Lin Xiang, Chen Xunyong, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and others, as well as staff members from various Yuan, departments, and committees, totaling about 400 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Niu Yongjian reported on the need for political and educational integration suited to modern China. The general idea was that the government's responsibility is to handle all political affairs for the people of a country, and the people's most essential need is to seek general peace and happiness. Therefore, those who bear the highest political responsibility, both in China and abroad, ancient and modern, must make the creation of peace and happiness for the entire society their main purpose. This kind of peace and happiness is created by preventing usurpation and disturbance. However, countries have different strengths, weaknesses, poverty, and wealth, and oppression and aggression are used to satisfy the desire for disturbance. This is a common occurrence in the international community. Therefore, in an era of power struggles between evil countries, the people should first seek the existence and strength of the country, and then individual lives and families can be entrusted to it. The peace and happiness of a country, under international oppression and aggression, must have the ability and financial resources to save and protect the country. Therefore, today we must make this great preparation, that is, the country must create the ability and financial resources of the entire people to save the country. The key points of our work today should be how to consolidate the country and create the strength of the entire people: (1) The country should implement national organization and national training with the goal of utilizing the entire people to mobilize national strength. (2) Establish the vitality of the entire Chinese people as the goal and revitalize the national spirit. (3) Prevent foreign psychological aggression as the goal and formulate new creeds and theories that emerging ethnic groups should abide by. (4) Manage large-scale medical administration according to the proportion of the entire people's suffering. (5) Manage all interests with the working ability of the entire people and implement cooperation between national production and consumption. (6) Train and reward physical and chemical sciences to promote heavier industries. (7) Strive for the country's basic mainstay. (8) Improve administrative efficiency and rectify the examination system. (9) Members of political parties must take responsibility, set an example, and be the mainstays of the entire people in order to implement the achievements of political tutelage. (10) To carry out national salvation, we must have sacrifice and the determination to win. The above items must be implemented with training methods, educational spirit, and realistic construction, that is, politics is education, and education is politics, from small to large, from near to far, step by step. This is what government agencies at all levels should comprehensively plan. We deeply hope that our party comrades will intensify their efforts to revive our nation.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 174th Commemoration Week at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th. Zhong Wei, Ye Chucang, Ding Weifen, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Deng Jiayan, Li Ciwen, Wang Qi, Hong Ludong, Li Zonghuang, and staff members totaling about 600 people attended. Chairman Ju Zheng and Chen Lifu reported on the "Issue of Cultural Construction," stating in brief that most people are currently striving to promote the cultural construction movement. To understand the significance of this movement, we must first define culture. The Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean point out that "Sincerity takes form, form becomes manifest, manifest becomes bright, bright moves, movement changes, change transforms," which are the stages of evolution of all things. "Sincerity," "form," "manifest," and "bright" are natural phenomena, and making people know them is called civilization. "Movement," "change," and "transformation" are transformations through human power, and only then are they called culture. We should be determined to review the past, promote our country's inherent civilization, grasp the present, evolve it to adapt to the environment, and determine the future, pointing out the attitude of the nation's bright and brilliant goals to strive for cultural construction, so that the national spirit can be permanently solid. It is not about abandoning our country's inherent civilization and exclusively stealing everything from foreigners, or only knowing how to preserve civilization without changing or transforming it. If so, it is not "culture" but "cultural preservation" or "cultural occupation." It is hoped that all comrades will rise up and catch up to revitalize the nation. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Illegal Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway and Relations Between Japan and Russia <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding the illegal sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway began in June 1933. After countless twists and turns, both parties finally reached an agreement on January 22 of this year. The Russian side, not hesitating to accept a minimum price of 140 million yuan, ceded the railway to the Japanese. The official signing is scheduled for the 23rd of this month. Our government, regarding this matter as concerning sovereignty, naturally finds it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, it has repeatedly lodged protests with both the Soviet and Japanese sides. On the 16th of this month, another severe protest was lodged. At the same time, based on the Sino-Soviet Agreement of the 13th year of the Republic of China, statements were sent to all relevant countries, reiterating our country's position. Although its effect is currently difficult to foresee, it is an appropriate and necessary action to deny this illegal sale and preserve all our country's rights on the railway.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway within our country's borders not only disregards our country's sovereignty, but also violates the Sino-Soviet Agreement, an illegal and unreasonable action. Considering that Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations have already been restored today, we cannot help but feel deeply regretful. However, considering the reason why the Soviet Union disregarded China's interests and acted so recklessly, it is also related to the recent changes in the international environment. It is because (1) since Japan invaded and occupied the four northeastern provinces of our country and organized a puppet state, Japan and Russia have been in a position of direct conflict at all times, and the dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway has a great possibility of becoming a fuse for war between the two countries. Now, the Russian side has to make many concessions to Japan to seek temporary peace, and its purpose is to勉强maintain peace in order to carry out its original plan for socialist construction. (2) Since the completion of the Jihui, Laha, Binbei, and other railways in the puppet Manchukuo, the Chinese Eastern Railway has long lost its independence in terms of economics. Even if war breaks out between Japan and Russia, the outcome will not depend on the gains or losses of this railway. (3) In terms of relations with Western Europe, Hitler's ambition is pressing. His attempt to seize Ukraine through Poland has never ceased for a single day. Recently, he openly declared the abolition of the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles and is reorganizing his military. In particular, he dared to be a vanguard against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has long been aware of this situation. In order to avoid the danger of being attacked by both the East and the West, it had to make concessions to Japan on the Chinese Eastern Railway issue.</p>
<p>However, can the success of the illegal transfer negotiations of the Chinese Eastern Railway ease the tense relations between Japan and the Soviet Union? This is also an issue worthy of our attention. Commentators often say, "The success of the Chinese Eastern Railway transfer negotiations is not only enough to eliminate the Soviet Union's source of redification in the Far East, but also the diplomatic disputes between Japan and Russia can be swept away from now on. Therefore, after the establishment of the Chinese Eastern Railway sale, Japan's rule over Manchuria will become more consolidated, and the South Manchuria Railway can also let go of its operations on the entire Manchurian railway, making it easier to develop resources in northern Manchuria. Exports to Russia are gradually increasing. As a result, Japan-Soviet relations can become more and more缓和, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries may become more peaceful and friendly." However, according to our observations, the success of the Chinese Eastern Railway transfer between Japan and the Soviet Union is indeed a preliminary success in easing Japan-Soviet relations. However, if one is too optimistic about the future Japan-Soviet relations, I am afraid it is too early. Why? The center of gravity of Japan-Soviet relations is not entirely in the resolution of the Chinese Eastern Railway dispute, but in how the non-aggression treaty is concluded. Whether Japan is willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with Russia is an important key to whether the relations between the two countries can truly move towards缓和 in the future. How the international relations in East Asia will develop in the future will also change depending on the changes in this issue. Secondly, what we should pay attention to is the fishery conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in the coastal area of ​​Vladivostok. The intention of the Japanese side is to eliminate the Soviet Union's fishery forces along the eastern coast. Whether the Russian side is willing to give in to this is a big question. Again, the ambition of the Japanese military is to seize the eastern coastal Primorsky Krai of Russian Siberia. At the same time, eliminate the potential forces of the Soviet Union in Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang to complete the necessary preparations for its exclusive occupation of East Asia. Now, although the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been successful, whether the Japanese side will stop at the right time and be willing to maintain a lasting peace with the Soviet Union, I am afraid that no one dares to make a positive prediction at present. If the Japanese side is not satisfied with this and makes further demands, will the Russian side continue to retreat step by step and not resist? This is also a question that is worth pondering and imagining.</p>
<p>All of these are important issues related to the illegal sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. How these various issues will unfold is not only deeply related to our country, but also has a great impact on the safety of the entire East Asia. Therefore, we must not ignore it.</p>

<p>(Geneva) Negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia to resolve the dispute have now broken down, and the clouds of war are once again hanging over North Africa. The Secretariat of the League of Nations has received a telegram from the Abyssinian government, learning of the latest developments. People here are greatly disturbed by this. The Abyssinian government's telegram urges the League of Nations to deal with the Abyssinian request based on Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant as soon as possible. After diplomatic negotiations stalled in mid-January, Abyssinia appealed to the League of Nations based on this article. In order to consider Abyssinia's application, the Council of the League of Nations, which was originally scheduled to meet in May, will probably be convened in advance. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations today received another request from the King of Abyssinia to intervene in the dispute between his country and Italian Somaliland. At the same time, the situation on the border between the two countries is dangerous. It is said that Italy continues to send troops and equipment to Somaliland. Currently, there are more than 10,000 well-trained motorized elite soldiers bordering Abyssinia. The League of Nations recently sent a committee to the capital of Abyssinia to investigate the current situation in order to suggest a peaceful solution. However, today's request from Abyssinia is for the Council of the League of Nations to intervene immediately. According to reports, the King of Abyssinia has also repeatedly written to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating that Abyssinia has nothing to do with the Wal Wal incident. However, Italy continues to send troops to East Africa without stopping. Currently, more than tens of thousands of Italian troops are stationed on the border of Abyssinia, and there are 25,000 indigenous troops. Although Abyssinia also has 100,000 troops, their military equipment is poor and they are not the enemy of the Italian army. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e23">### Simon Announces in the House of Commons That a Note Has Been Presented to Germany; Consultations Were Held with France and Italy in Advance; Germany Expresses Its Willingness to Cooperate in the Future; Obstacles to Returning to the League of Nations Have Been Removed <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon participated in a cabinet meeting this morning to discuss the issue of German rearmament. Afterwards, he went to the House of Commons and announced that the government had instructed the British ambassador in Berlin to deliver a note to the German government this afternoon. The contents of the note cannot be disclosed before the German Foreign Minister receives it, but it will be announced as soon as he receives it. The government has consulted with the French and Italian governments on the issue of German rearmament, Simon said. After Simon finished speaking, opposition leader Lansbury asked whether the government would discuss this matter with the United States and other signatory countries of the treaty, or request a meeting of the League of Nations. Simon replied that these matters are currently under consideration by the government. Although the contents of the British government's note to Germany have not been disclosed by the authorities, everyone believes that it must contain some inquiries, with the aim of understanding the future attitude of Germany's foreign policy, especially whether Germany is still prepared to participate in collective security methods. This morning's cabinet meeting lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. The cabinet met at 10:30 in the morning, half an hour earlier than usual. The crowd gathered on Downing Street retreated after being driven back by the police when cabinet members arrived. The cabinet members all looked happy. Foreign Secretary Simon stayed at the Foreign Office for a long time before going out to meet at the Prime Minister's residence across the street. He had a smile on his face when he left the Foreign Office. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally believed that the British cabinet meeting this morning decided to submit two questions to the German government and ask it to answer: (1) Is Germany prepared to return to the League of Nations? (2) Is Germany determined to participate in the security and consultation system under the leadership of the League of Nations? According to reports, at yesterday's meeting of the cabinet disarmament problem committee, two observations were made on Germany's decision to implement conscription and increase military spending. On the one hand, the restoration of conscription in Germany was regarded as a clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles. On the other hand, the establishment of 36 divisions in the German army was considered to exceed the limit of equality required by Germany, and the number of troops was more than that of Germany's neighboring countries. The cabinet meeting today reaffirmed these observations. The British note to Germany will specifically raise the above two points. Regarding this note, the government will issue a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to recent news from Rome, it has been confirmed that the Italian government has agreed to the French proposal regarding the situation caused by Germany's decision to restore military freedom and establish a compulsory conscription system. Italy supports the joint protest of the British, French and Italian ambassadors in Germany, and Italy also advocates that the three countries consult with each other. As for submitting this matter to the League of Nations for handling, Italy does not express any objection, but believes that it should be submitted to the League of Nations after the results of consultations between the United Kingdom, France and Italy. In addition, the British government's views will be officially learned tonight. However, it is generally believed that the current situation is very serious, and there will be no more differences in the opinions of the United Kingdom, France and Italy. After the three governments exchange opinions, they will definitely produce a common program on how to deal with Germany's rash decision. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German side ignores the comments of foreign newspapers and the claim in French newspapers that France, Britain and Italy will issue a joint note protesting Germany's conscription system, because Germany's determination will never be shaken by external events and criticisms. On the contrary, Germany is now waiting quietly for the development of the situation and revealing its position, that is, Germany has already launched a campaign to sweep away the unequal treatment of the Treaty of Versailles. From now on, it will be happy to cooperate with all countries to create a new and peaceful Europe. Responsible parties here unanimously insist that the German army will be a defender of peace, and will never forget it. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news from Berlin, Germany has obtained equal status in the military, so it feels that there are no more obstacles to returning to the League of Nations. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The whole world is feeling uneasy due to Germany's conscription system. Head of State Hitler issued a book to the world today, stating that Germany does not want war. What our people seek is only the opportunity to live and work in peace and contentment. However, there is really no way to continue to survive under the humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles. Believe me, the joy of our people today does not hide any malice or ambitions of aggression against any country. We do not believe that Germany's actions can increase the crisis of war, etc. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces Blomberg declared in Berlin today when commemorating the fallen soldiers of the European War that no civilized country in the world has sacrificed as much life or endured as much pain as Germany in the four years of the European War. Therefore, the responsibility of those who died later is also heavier than that of the Germans. If we do not know how to repay our gratitude, then all the souvenirs are the same as official documents. Blomberg then traced back the suffering Germany has experienced since the Great War, and the revival after Hitler came to power, and said that since the promulgation of the conscription system, the German government has created a new foundation for security. Germany's army and navy will be no different from those of that year. Internally, military education and the spirit of sacrificing for the country will be instilled in young people. Externally, it will be Germany's defender and strive for equal rights for Germany. Our ideal should be a strong armed and self-respecting Germany, which will never again sign treaties that humiliate the country. But we should also keep in mind the lessons that the Great War taught us and avoid a second world war, because we must save ourselves and the future of Germany. If a second world war breaks out, Europe will not be enough to be a battlefield, and culture cannot be destroyed by modern warfare. We Germans do not seek a war of revenge, because the good name we have earned in the four years of the Great War is enough to shine in history. If the natural law that dominates all nations is still worth considering, then we believe that Europe and the world have the possibility of peaceful transformation. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e25">### Germany Wants to Use Established Facts as the Basis for Future Negotiations <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today's diplomatic and political commentary newspaper of the government agency published an article detailing the meaning of Germany's implementation of conscription. The newspaper first stated, "After a country is completely disarmed, will it not be invaded by neighboring countries? This is something that is absolutely not guaranteed. Therefore, the German cabinet's decision to implement a national conscription system is actually due to the most basic survival of a strong country. In recent years, although Germany's rights, such as self-defense and security, have been repeatedly declared by various countries, and its equal status has been unanimously recognized by various countries, the distance between empty talk and reality has increased day by day, and the environment has become increasingly evil. Therefore, to this day, the German government's actions should not be regarded as sudden by fair and impartial observers in the world. Even in terms of time, the current environment is also appropriate, because in the past few months, Germany has quietly watched the rapid expansion of their military equipment by the major powers in Europe. Among these powers, some are bound by treaties and clearly promised to reduce military preparations, or at least not to increase the total number of troops, and these countries are all participants in the disarmament conference. In terms of moral concepts, there is no reason to increase military equipment, but their actions to increase military equipment are clearly visible to everyone. Today's Germany, in order to stare at the facts, has to place the defense of the country in a natural, broader and more basic last country. What is even more important is that Germany's military reorganization, to its extreme, is only reaching a low level of military equipment, and it is only the beginning of the recent arms race among the powers. Therefore, Germany's actions, although not to be taken as isolated actions, are not to attack everyone, but to advance. On the contrary, this is the beginning of healthy development. The appropriate balance that Europe has lacked in the past fifteen years, and the unease and crisis caused by this defect, can now be eliminated in one fell swoop. Therefore, the establishment of equality in national defense will be a clear basis for future negotiations. All relevant countries should rely on existing realities. Germany has been and is willing to accept any restrictions, but it depends on whether other powers are willing to receive the same treatment. In a word, what Germany requires is nothing more than equal status among equal countries." (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the issue of German rearmament, according to those familiar with the political situation here, Article 5 of the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that Germany must disarm, and Article 8 stipulates that other countries must also reduce their military equipment. Sixteen years have passed since the conclusion of the treaty. The German side has long complied with the treaty and reduced its military equipment to the scope allowed by the treaty. However, other countries have made a lot of noise about the danger to security and have tried their best to reorganize their military affairs. According to the facts, such as the recent publication of the British White Paper, the extension of the French military service years, and even the expansion of the Soviet Union's army to 960,000 people, Germany is located in the center of Europe and is surrounded by enemies on all sides. Since others do not comply with the treaty, Germany is not willing to lag behind in order to defend the security of its territory. In particular, after the head of state Hitler returned to the country in Saar, he solemnly stated that there would be no territorial dispute with France in the future. At this point, those who feared Germany could be relieved. However, others do not understand, and they all take military competition as a matter of course. In fact, the facts are as described above. The reason for Germany's rearmament is partly due to the fact that others do not comply with the treaty, and the important thing is that it is purely for self-defense in order to maintain world peace.

<p>(Berlin) This morning, the grandest military ceremony since the European War was held at the National Theater. At an early hour, the whole city heard the sound of marching troops and the sound of cavalry hooves. Hitler's personal black guard was lined up on both sides of the road leading to the hospital. Those who attended the ceremony included former Crown Prince Wilhelm, Head of State Hitler, General Mackensen, General Goering, and other government officials. Defense Minister Blomberg gave a speech to the audience to commemorate the German soldiers who died in the European War. The British, French, and Italian ambassadors did not attend, but the US ambassador and the aviation and military members of the British ambassador's office were present. Blomberg said that if there is a world war today, it would be equivalent to self-destruction. What Germans want is peace and to enjoy the equal rights and equal security of all nations. After the meeting, the crowd went to the square in front of the old Berlin residence. Military bands were gathered in the field to play music. Seventy flag bearers of the National Defense Forces marched in goose steps to the front of the viewing platform, where Head of State Hitler, General Goering, and other high-ranking military officers saluted the National Socialist Party. At that time, a field artillery team fired 24 salutes. Then the crowd went to the tomb of the Unknown Soldier to lay wreaths in tribute. After the ceremony, Hitler took a plane to Munich and drove through the streets where thousands of people gathered on both sides to review the entire army of Bavaria. Before the review ceremony was held, a car drove into the square at the intersection. The driver accidentally turned to the side of the road. At that time, Hitler was standing there, planning to step onto the viewing platform opposite. Everyone was worried when they saw this, but no one dared to make a sound. It took 30 seconds before it stopped. Then two black guards came and stood on the footboard of the car, waving for the driver to drive away. Who was in the car was not announced. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>(London) According to telegrams from the capitals of various countries, the whole of Europe opposes Germany's tearing up of the Treaty of Versailles and rearming.

If Germany does it first, Hungary and Bulgaria will follow suit. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, one of the results of Germany's actions will be that France will pay attention to the second line of defense, that is, the conclusion of mutual assistance pacts between France, Russia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. If the Eastern European Pact cannot succeed, then this move is even more urgent. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">### British Newspapers Criticize but Remain Calm <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(London) None of the British morning newspapers failed to criticize Germany's decision to expand its military equipment, but few made alarmist remarks. Some newspapers debated whether Foreign Secretary Simon should postpone his trip to Germany. Several other newspapers attached great importance to the words of German Defense Minister Blomberg that Europe is too small and cannot be a second battlefield, that war is a way of self-destruction, and that Germany wants to establish a new order in Europe and the world by peaceful means. The Morning Post stated that this week's incidents showed the futility of relying on written guarantees. Hitler's brown shirts are no different from Caesar's military uniforms, both discarding the principle of Germanic power. Disarmament is now hopeless, but the pursuit of peaceful cooperation should not be abandoned because of this. The Daily Express stated that Germany's declaration should not be regarded as a challenge to further expand military equipment, but should be regarded as a renewed and serious effort to seek universal disarmament, because the way to obtain peace lies in collective guarantees, not in collective military equipment. The Daily Mail stated that there is no reason to panic now. Hitler's actions are just changing the brand. The Exchange News stated that the German government's announcement of the new compulsory military investment law today is extremely untimely, because what is urgently needed now is a meeting of responsible leaders of the countries concerned. The Daily Telegraph stated that the German government has deliberately destroyed the old basis for negotiations. If it does not suggest a new basis for negotiations, then Britain will not send Simon to visit Berlin. If Germany demands an absolute minimum of 36 divisions, then there will be no hope for a military agreement between France and Germany, and the so-called security will become a bubble again. The Times stated that if Hitler's actions are only a way to seek equality, then the harm is not irreparable, and Foreign Secretary Simon should visit Berlin according to the original plan. British policy does not fluctuate constantly. Its purpose is to form a collective system to protect Europe's security. If this hope still exists, then it will not abandon its work. However, what Hitler himself must hear urgently is whether Germany sincerely wants to participate in this system and carry out an equal plan to limit military equipment. The Financial Times stated that as far as the London market is concerned, only a calm attitude should be maintained. The Daily Express stated that the National Socialist Party government is now using this move to express its desire to restore the lost legal benefits and land by force. When Britain encounters this crisis, it should no longer be involved in the broken treaties, but place its sea, land and air forces to become the strongest country in the world other than the United States. A Reuters diplomatic reporter stated that the entire foundation of the international military system that everyone hopes can replace the Treaty of Versailles now seems to be destroyed by Germany's actions. The issue of Simon and Eden's visits should be reconsidered due to the changing situation. However, in any case, Eden will eventually visit Russia and Poland. According to qualified observers in London, Germany can still participate in a collective security plan, but what its Minister of Propaganda Goebbels said that Germany's national defense must be handled by Germany's own power in the future can be considered an ominous sign. It is heard that the French government has sent a note to the British government through its ambassador in the United Kingdom, explaining France's views on Germany's actions and suggesting that discussions should be started immediately to deal with the new situation. A Reuters report from Paris stated that French officials seemed to advocate submitting the German matter to the League of Nations, but this proposal has not yet been decided. People in Paris believe that Germany's recent actions to violate the treaty cannot be ignored without protest. As for what kind of protest, it depends on the consultation between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. However, since Germany's actions are related to other countries that signed the Treaty of Versailles, the most appropriate way to handle this matter is to do it in Geneva. French Prime Minister Flandin will make a statement on Germany's restoration of military equipment in the House of Commons on Tuesday. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Following Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles military clauses and its unauthorized reinstatement of compulsory military service, the newspapers here are generally advocating that the great powers should urgently form a coalition to safeguard peace, to prevent solemn treaties from being openly violated without penalty, and to ensure European order. In particular, they are calling for close cooperation between Britain, France, and Italy. *Le Petit Parisien* stated, "The great powers' initial reaction to Germany's move is almost certain to be a strong protest to Germany by their ambassadors stationed there. However, the governments of the other nations may also issue solemn declarations stating the seriousness of Germany's actions. As for British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany, if it proceeds as originally planned, it is feared that it will not yield any results, as Germany has clearly opposed the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Conversely, French Foreign Minister Laval's proposed visit to Moscow is widely anticipated." *Le Journal* stated, "In 1914, before the start of the Great War, Germany predicted that Britain would not interfere in continental European affairs and thus dared to initiate hostilities. If Germany is to be prevented from repeating its old tricks, the only effective method is for the great powers to form a sober and resolute coalition, which may perhaps succeed." *L'Echo de Paris* regretted Britain's hesitancy and indecision, stating, "Germany always benefits from the hesitation and indecision of the great powers, and this case is no different."

<h3 id="e33">Russian Newspaper Discusses Germany's Accelerated War Preparations <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) *Izvestia's* lead article discusses Germany's implementation of universal conscription, stating, "The Soviet Union is not a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, so it need not analyze this major event from a diplomatic or legal perspective. Our concern is limited solely to its political significance. It is a great mistake to say that since German armaments already exist, the cancellation of the Treaty of Versailles is merely a formality and a gesture. Germany's implementation of universal conscription today and its declaration of rearmament are precisely intended to achieve its profound practical goals. Therefore, what was said above is not correct. Germany today is rejecting all conventions, declaring its freedom to reorganize its armaments, with the aim of acquiring the military technology it has created in the last two years in the shortest possible time. Therefore, what we see is Germany's accelerated war preparations.</p>
<p>"Negotiations between Germany and the British Foreign Secretary are imminent, and negotiations with France will follow. Germany's unilateral departure from the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles comes exactly one week before the start of Anglo-German negotiations. This move is a provocation to those powers willing to recognize Germany's equal rights in a general security organization. This step has a great political purpose. Britain, France, and Italy are willing to lift restrictions on German armaments in exchange for political constraints that would limit Germany's aggressive policies. At the same time, they plan to compromise with Germany on the amount of armaments. However, Germany responded with a declaration of universal conscription, implying that the amount of German armaments has been determined by Germany itself. Therefore, it need not assume any obligations in the security realm in exchange for concessions made to it on the armaments issue. Therefore, the purpose of Germany's move is to ensure that Germany bears no obligations in the security realm. German imperialism will select a sacrificial victim to test its iron fist. Therefore, this move is a preparation for war in the political sense. "Germany's policy is entirely created by the policies of the great powers themselves (first and foremost, Britain). They endorse Germany and encourage the leaders of German policy, saying, 'Now is the time to take risks,' and indicating to them that any action is permissible. For example, Germany's proposal to negotiate separately with Britain, to strike at the Anglo-French front, as a response to the Anglo-French proposal of February 3, was actually accepted. Again, when all parties asked Germany to participate in an organization to safeguard peace in Europe, Germany responded by refusing to promote peace, but the response Germany received was a palliative, implying that they could certainly reach some compromise, as if war and peace could truly be compromised. Thus, German diplomacy has a belief that they can exchange promises. To confirm this belief, Germany initially asked Foreign Secretary Simon to postpone his visit to Germany, a move that had never been seen in diplomatic history. However, the response was a gentle and agreeable tone. Then Germany made its penultimate move: regardless of the prohibitions of the Treaty of Versailles, it declared that it would set up an air force from April 1, and this move was also accepted. So what shame will Germany have in its policies? It not only thwarts its enemies, but it also has a greater victory at home, namely, raising the tide of German nationalism and consolidating the position of the fascist government in war preparations. We certainly know that the speed of Germany's rearmament and its firm rejection of various diplomatic conventions are all symbols of Germany's preparations for actual action. Will its goal be Austria? (Hitler recently said that the German question must be resolved in the same way as the Saar question.) Danzig? (Although Danzig is not German territory, its President of the Senate attached the words "Hail Hitler" to the end of his government documents.) Or Memel? No one can say. However, one thing is absolutely certain: Germany's recent actions have predetermined its political aggression.</p>
<p>"In this situation, everything depends on the attitude of the powers against whom Germany's policies are directed. If they can quickly form an organization for mutual assistance once Germany initiates aggression, and if Berlin can understand that this organization will materialize whether Germany wishes to join it or not, then it will realize that Germany alone cannot stand against a coalition of powers willing to maintain peace. "Time waits for no one; there must be no hesitation or indecision. The question today is that Germany has already stated its goals, so the other nations should immediately state their means of defense and their ability to defend the peace of Europe and all mankind."

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese authorities have not yet received official information from Berlin regarding the matter of Germany's military rearmament, and therefore have not issued any comments. However, the general public believes that this is entirely a European issue, so the Japanese government will adopt a policy of quiet observation. As for what repercussions this matter will have in the Far East, that will depend on its development. Japanese newspapers have published lengthy commentaries on Hitler's declaration. *Asahi Shimbun* expressed regret over the attitude Germany is now taking, fearing that it will provoke international sentiment. However, the newspaper does not believe that Hitler's actions will lead to a new crisis in Europe. It continued that French policy is fickle and inconsistent, on the one hand expressing trust in the League of Nations, on the other hand calling on European nations to resist Germany. The nations involved, such as France and Britain, should now use their political talents to find ways to overcome difficulties and improve international relations, and should not merely interpret treaties rigidly. *Hochi Shimbun* advised Germany to achieve its national aspirations through moderate methods, and advised the nations involved to treat Germany more generously. However, *Nichinichi Shimbun* held a fearful view, stating that Germany's rearmament, even if it does not lead to war, will put Europe in a state of great unease. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Australia to Strengthen Armaments, Emphasizing Air Force <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Associated Press learned today that increasing Australia's armaments will be the second step in the British Empire's long-term defense plan. May 6, the 50th anniversary of the British monarch's accession to the throne, will be an appropriate opportunity for officials from the self-governing dominions to gather in London to discuss and promote security plans. Since Japan announced the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty, which will expire on December 31, 1936, Britain is actively planning the Empire's security, with a particular focus on the Pacific region. The initial concrete plan for this matter is Australia's ten-year military reform plan. Sir Tingey, Secretary of the Defence Committee, inspected South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada for a long time and held meetings with the authorities and military commanders. He returned to London on January 6. Over the past few weeks, he has discussed the results of his trip with cabinet members. According to expert observations, particular attention will be paid to strengthening the Australian Air Force and using it to resist attacks from the sea. As for restoring conscription, it will provoke opposition. Infantry is also not suitable for Australia. Both are reasons for promoting increased air defense capabilities.

<h3 id="e37">Greece Clarifies Internal Affairs <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Athens: Prime Minister Tsaldaris and Metaxas, the minister without portfolio representing right-wing forces, have reached an agreement on the government's program of action for internal affairs. Prime Minister Tsaldaris believes that although the government must take active measures to clarify internal affairs, the government's actions should be within the legal scope. Land Minister Kondylis also holds the same view. The only things that the government has firmly decided on now are the abolition of the Senate, the increase of executive power, and the purge of party elements from the army and administrative organs. However, the method of implementing these reforms has not yet been decided. Some people advocate holding a popular referendum to avoid the convening of a national assembly to amend the constitution, as demanded by some political parties. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

In addition to the financial negotiations, French Foreign Minister Laval and Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans also discussed various diplomatic issues. Furthermore, Belgian cabinet members indicated that the interdependence of the gold standard countries has always been Belgium's main perspective. Therefore, the main purpose of this Franco-Belgian talk is to obtain some trade benefits from France, especially such as the most-favored-nation clauses. It is hoped that changes will be made to those that harm Franco-Belgian trade, and the French side is also suffering from the increase in import surpluses. Therefore, they are quite considering further cooperation in trade with the gold standard countries. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Today is the second day of the United States' crackdown on crime. Over 2,000 criminals, from petty thieves to kidnappers, have been arrested and imprisoned. Over 12,000 US officials are participating in this campaign. Police and state troops across the country are also assisting.

Detectives have been working secretly and collecting evidence for months in preparation for court trials. The Treasury Department and the Justice Department are keeping the names of the investigators secret. However, it is heard that many central government officials have infiltrated the gangs and gained the trust of the gang leaders. The crackdown on bandits came suddenly, and the police authorities in most major cities were unaware of it beforehand. The fingerprints of those arrested are now being sent to Washington to be compared with the 5 million fingerprints in the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which is the most scientific institution in the world for studying criminals. The government hopes that crime across the country can be eradicated as a result. (National News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Japan Establishes Cabinet Deliberation Council; Establishes Emergency Policy; House of Representatives Discussed Yesterday <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives Budget Committee began discussing the Cabinet Deliberation Council issue at around 11:00 AM today. The exchange between Kiyose Kiyoo and Prime Minister Okada was as follows: Kiyose asked, what is the reason for establishing the Cabinet Deliberation Council? Prime Minister Okada replied, to establish national policies for the current emergency. Kiyose asked, have you considered the issue of the return of party politics? The Prime Minister replied, the Cabinet Deliberation Council has nothing to do with party politics. Kiyose asked, then is the establishment of the Cabinet Deliberation Council a strengthening of the non-partisan cabinet?</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied, no, it is an organ for establishing national plans for the next century. Kiyose asked, what are the so-called important national policies deliberated by the Council? The Prime Minister replied, issues of local autonomy, central and local finances, and the reorganization of tax revenues. Kiyose asked, can't these issues be agreed upon in the cabinet? The Prime Minister replied, the cabinet cannot decide on important national policies, so this Cabinet Deliberation Council is specifically used as a advisory body. Kiyose asked, the opinions within the cabinet should be controlled by the Prime Minister, so is the establishment of the Cabinet Deliberation Council forgetting the Prime Minister's responsibility? The Prime Minister replied, the cabinet is not unable to establish important national policies. The establishment of the Deliberation Council can make the relationships between various ministries smoother. Kiyose asked, isn't the Deliberation Council making the relationships between the various ministries smoother an act of overreach? Is the Prime Minister trying to avoid taking responsibility? The Prime Minister replied, all responsibility should be borne by the Prime Minister. Kiyose asked, establishing such an organ after the Okada Cabinet was formed can be said to expose the cabinet's lack of management and lack of confidence. Isn't the establishment of national policy deliberation like building a house on top of a house? The Prime Minister replied, it cannot be said to be building a house on top of a house because it is established under the cabinet (the entire room laughed).</p>
<p>Kiyose also asked about military and diplomatic issues. A recess was taken at 1:18 PM. The meeting continued at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, with Nakatani Sadayori raising questions about the Cabinet Deliberation Council issue. The questions and answers are recorded below:</p>
<p>Q: How should the cases decided by the Deliberation Council be handled? Judging from this situation, isn't the cabinet losing its unity? Why was the budget, which is so important and includes such significant policies, delayed until today?</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Due to various circumstances, it has been delayed until now. I should certainly apologize.</p>
<p>Q: In any case, the second reserve fund, which cannot be avoided, and the budget of the Cabinet Deliberation Council are combined into one, and you also want to pass it. Is this delay due to this impure thinking?</p>
<p>Prime Minister: There is absolutely no impure thinking.</p>
<p>Q: Is the Cabinet Deliberation Council permanent?</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Because it is for establishing national plans, a permanent nature is preferable. If the cabinet changes and the council also changes with it, it would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Q: Why not adopt a system without any grand strategies? Finance Minister Takahashi is said to have also held this view. Is this true? What is his opinion?</p>
<p>Finance Minister: I also held this view, but now it has been decided that the Deliberation Council is the most suitable. Hoshijima Nijiro (Seiyu) asked the following question: The composition of the Cabinet Deliberation Council is neither like the Brain Trust in the United States nor like the Economic General Staff in Germany, but most similar to the State Planning Committee in the Soviet Union. At a time when parliamentary politics are reviving, there is such an uninteresting situation. I wonder what your thoughts are? The Prime Minister replied, the Cabinet Deliberation Council is definitely not like the above, and it does not hinder the powers of the parliament, etc. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Soviet writer Tretyakov wrote a long article published in the Literary Gazette, discussing Chinese drama in detail. The article highly praised the great influence of this kind of drama and its penetration into the masses. Tretyakov said, "Mei Lanfang is not only the darling of modern Chinese drama, but also should be the pride of the entire history of Chinese drama art. Mei's exquisite and charming performance, various costumes, and the deafening and dazzling effects on the Chinese stage, coupled with the softening effect, are indeed the reasons for his fame. At the same time, his main achievement is that he can insert colorful costumes with low-pitched syllables to infuse psychology into the performance. Mei's performance can make people relive the scenes of the 1911 Revolution, and its greatness and importance lie in its ability to make Chinese drama a world phenomenon. In Mei's person, Chinese drama can break national boundaries and penetrate the hearts of European and American audiences. At the same time, foreigners do not feel that it is difficult to understand foreign dramas, but rather a performance of great art." (17th TASS)</p>

<h3 id="e106">Troop Transfers in Chaozhou Lead to Increased Bandit Activity <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Recently, taking advantage of troop transfers in the Chaozhou region, bandits have been increasingly active. Local guard units are understaffed and struggling to cope. On the 11th evening, the village of Xinbei, near Chiliao in the Guiyu district of Chaoyang County, was suddenly attacked by 160 Communist bandits, including more than 30 female Communists, all with short hair, dressed in military uniforms, and armed with machine guns and Mauser pistols. They stormed the village watchtower, disarming the guards and seizing 14 rifles. The police force hastily engaged in battle, sounding gongs to alert neighboring villages for assistance. However, due to the late hour and strong winds, nearby villages did not hear the alarm. The bandits fired on the watchtower and then broke into the home of villager Liu Hudi, looting everything and kidnapping Liu to Beishan. Furthermore, Huang Huishen, a resident of Shifo Village, who ran a Western medicine shop in Chijiao, was kidnapped by two female Communists while passing through the Nanshanke area of Shibi. Huang managed to escape halfway and reported that there were many bandits in Beishan. After the departure of Zhong’s regiment from Raoping County, on the evening of the 7th, bandits armed with Mauser pistols gathered five miles southwest of the city, plotting to attack. They posted reactionary slogans overnight. At that time, a unit of Ye's regiment arrived from Shangrao and immediately sounded bugles, mobilizing the police force to be on high alert. Seeing that the relief troops had arrived, the bandits dared not attack the city. The city is rife with prostitutes, making it easy to harbor criminals. The council has resolved to expel itinerant prostitutes from the territory. Moreover, Rong Village, at the border of Chao’an and Shaoping, was stormed by dozens of bandits on the evening of the 10th, attempting to loot. The deputy village chief led a team to engage the bandits, who also opened fire, resulting in a fierce battle lasting an hour. The bandits were overwhelmed and fled into the nearby forest. During the attack, two villagers were kidnapped, but the village chief led a team in pursuit, and the bandits released them. The following night, Shiken Village was also looted by bandits, with a large number of people kidnapped. According to visitors from Raoping, recently many bandits from the Fujian border have infiltrated the Purao area. On the morning of the 7th, 67 laborers transporting goods in the Fenghuang district went to Chao’an city to buy groceries. While passing through Dashui Creek in the Shangrong district, at the border of Chaozhou and Raoping, a known haunt of Communist bandits, all the goods being transported were robbed by the bandits, who fled into the mountains. The porters and vendors cried out in misery along the way. This is the latest situation. Furthermore, a group of Communist bandits, numbering over 300, infiltrated the Fengshun area of the Tiandong district via Chao’an, heavily armed with guns and cannons. They have yet to be suppressed. These individuals claim to be an anti-Japanese army, with strong political overtones. They attempted to borrow over 10,000 yuan from the Chenghuang business association for military expenses, but the association refused. People in the surrounding area are quite fearful. After Chen Shuyiao's regiment took over defense of Fengshun, the defenses have been greatly strengthened. Regiment Commander Chen considers Fengshun to be the central hub of the Chaozhou and Meizhou counties and a historically vital military location, and has sent troops to build a ring road around the city, with a half-month deadline for completion, to aid in defense against bandits. In addition to building the road, the regiment has also banned people from bathing naked in the Tanghu hot springs during the day, expelled southern opera actresses, and designated locations outside the city for opium dens and gambling houses to maintain order. It is reported that the Fujian border is very unstable recently. Bandit leaders Zhang Dingcheng and female bandit Fan Lechun have returned to Changting from Ruichang, Jiangxi, commanding the Red bandits Deng Zhiwen, Qiu Jinsheng, and others, occupying Yongding, Shanghang, Qiling, Jinsha, and Lilongkeng. Ships on the Ting River to Fengshi and Hushi have been repeatedly intercepted and robbed, disrupting cargo transport between Fujian and Guangdong. This is a matter of great concern. An investigation reveals that most of the local Communist bandits in Chaozhou and Meizhou today infiltrated from the Fujian border and are taking advantage of troop transfers to increase their activity.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Bandit Suppression Completed in Central Anhui <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Since the elimination of the large-scale bandits in southern Anhui's Huizhou region, there has been another surge of banditry in central Anhui, including Hefei and Chaoxian. Governor Liu Zhenhuan has dispatched troops to suppress them. He also transferred Hu Peigeng, the security commander of the Yanhua Second District, from Wuhu to assist with the attack, and appointed Ge Yunlong as the commander for the suppression efforts in central Anhui, under unified command. Recently, the main force of the bandits has been defeated, with only a small number of bandits fleeing to remote areas near Hefei. The security forces under Commander Wang in Bengbu and the counties of Dingyuan and Quanjiao, as well as Zhao's troops under Ge, have made contact and plan to encircle and annihilate the remaining bandits. Those who were coerced into joining the bandits have been released and returned to their farms. It has come to light that the recent outbreak of banditry was largely due to famine and the manipulation of those affected. Military force can only address the symptoms; political solutions are needed to address the root cause. Some corrupt village leaders and local bullies were also found to be aiding the bandits. The provincial government has formulated measures to appease and resettle the displaced, recruit and investigate stray bandits, expedite emergency relief through work programs, strengthen self-defense and reorganize the baojia system, and prevent revenge killings, in order to protect people's lives and property. These measures have been communicated to all counties for strict implementation. Recently, Xu Tingyao, the head of the military group of the military transportation inspection delegation, whose hometown is Wuwei County in Anhui Province, learned about the frequent banditry in Anhui Province, as well as a mutiny by the security forces in Wuwei County. After arriving in Wuhu from Nanjing, he received news that order in Wuwei had been restored. Today, he went directly to Anqing to discuss matters with Governor Liu, and will then proceed to Wuhan and Sichuan to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on the situation. Since implementing the abolition of excessive taxes and levies, the provincial government has actively reorganized legitimate tax revenue. It has established the Anhui Province Tax Supervision Committee to eliminate corruption and avoid harassment. Prominent figures from both inside and outside the province, as well as leaders from various county chambers of commerce, have been invited to serve on the committee, including Xu Shiying and Wu Xingzhou. The provincial government considers the committee's role in the province's finances to be crucial and plans to formally establish it in the province soon. It has recently telegraphed the committee members to urge them to attend the inaugural meeting in the province. Wu Xingzhou departed yesterday with Cui Lianggong, a standing member of the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce. It is said that after the committee is established, its office will be moved to Wuhu for convenience. Xu Shiying, considering Wuhu to be Anhui's leading commercial hub, has also expressed his strong support for this proposal in a letter from Shanghai to Wuhu. The committee has the authority to directly make representations and suggestions to the provincial government regarding the management of taxes in the province and can directly appeal to the central government regarding any illegal or excessive taxes, to ensure that tax revenue goes to public use and that merchants are not subjected to illegal harassment.

The disease first broke out in Liuzhou and then spread to Luorong, Guilin, and Nanning. The number of deaths caused by the disease is countless. In recent days, officials and civilians in Guangxi Province have been extremely busy with prevention and control efforts. The military and provincial government have purchased a large batch of prophylactic serum, which is being distributed to military personnel, civilians, and government agencies for injection. At the same time, quarantine stations have been established in various locations to strictly inspect travelers. Any patient found to have the disease is immediately sent to a nearby hospital for isolation and treatment to prevent further transmission.

<p>The local anti-smoking committee, acting on instructions from the provincial anti-smoking committee, noted a significant discrepancy between the amount of officially sold opium in the county and the amount reported by opium smokers, indicating that private opium was rampant and undermining official sales. The committee was ordered to strictly investigate and arrest offenders to maintain the anti-smoking policy. Investigators Sun Zongxiang and Hu Qihao conducted an investigation. Investigator Sun discovered that opium was being transported to Songjiang by train this morning (the 18th) and, together with Investigator Hu and police chief Dong Futang, waited to apprehend the suspects. They found a man named Xiao Yang from out of town in the bottom of Liren Lane, and found a large package of private opium in his rickshaw. The package contained opium from various regions of Yunnan and Sichuan, all labeled as products of Zheng Qiaji Xiangtai, weighing 66 taels and 7 mace. The suspect and the evidence were seized and handed over to the anti-smoking committee for legal action. On the 17th, police officers from the Huayang Public Security Station searched the Huayang station of a long-distance bus and apprehended an opium trafficker named Zhong Xiaoguan, seizing 15 taels of Zheng Qiaji Sichuan opium. An elderly woman who was with him escaped on the spot. It is reported that they had brought the opium from Shanghai to Songjiang. Zhong was handed over to the Public Security Bureau and then transferred to the committee for legal action.</p>

It is reported that thirteen prisoners escaped. Apart from the two who were recaptured, eleven are still at large. The arresting authorities have dispatched personnel to hunt them down. The county government and court officials have entered the prison to conduct a roll call. The situation in the city is extremely tense. Further details will be reported.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Suzhou Silk Weaving Industry Representatives Petition in Nanjing <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Silk weaving factories using power looms in the Suzhou area previously found that the total electric meter of the power plant was inaccurate and the current was speeding up, causing the motors of each factory to use more electricity than normal, resulting in significant losses. They repeatedly negotiated with the power plant to request a reduction in charges, arguing that the price per degree for motor electricity set by the power plant was more than one cent higher than the price set by the Qishuyan power plant, and should also be reduced to ease the burden on businesses. After several months without a resolution, the factories appointed representatives Liu Fuqing, Lu Jigao, She Wenqing, and three others to travel to Nanjing yesterday (the 18th) with a petition to the Construction Committee, Ministry of Interior, and Executive Yuan, among other agencies. If they are unsuccessful, they will organize the Suzhou Electrical Users Union to fight for their cause, with a strong determination to achieve their goal.</p>

The Suzhou-Mudu Long-Distance Bus Company has purchased seven long-distance buses from England, which have already arrived in Shanghai and will soon be transported to Suzhou. The opening is currently scheduled for June 1st. The company believes that rickshaws should still be allowed to operate on the Suzhou-Mudu road after it opens, but horse-drawn carriages damage the road surface and are unhygienic, and should absolutely not be allowed. They submitted a request to the Construction Department yesterday (the 18th) to permanently ban horse-drawn carriages from using the road.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Efforts to Advocate for the Domestic Sale of Refined Salt <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Salt is one of the necessities of daily life for residents and is widely sold. Since the introduction of refined salt, there has been competition in the market between official salt and refined salt, with disputes arising over sales territories. Later, the Ministry of Finance established a system, designating areas within commercial ports where refined salt could be freely bought and sold. In Wuxi, this area was defined as north of the Gongyun Bridge to Zhoushanbang, approaching the Jingyun Market area, east to Xiaofen Bridge, and west to Yishan, within a surrounding area of thirty-six square li, as the commercial port area. Refined salt merchants, seeking greater convenience, repeatedly appealed for permission to freely circulate and sell refined salt within the five counties of Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi in the former Suzhou region. This was approved by the Fifth Plenary Session two years ago, with eight provisional measures being published and implemented. Now it is learned that over twenty groups in the city, including the wine and soy sauce, winemaking, restaurant, meat, bamboo, hat, and Jiande Association, are concerned that the sale of refined salt is being obstructed. The Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance will soon send personnel to Wuxi to investigate salt affairs. Therefore, a meeting was held to decide to appoint representatives to jointly petition after the official arrives in Wuxi, requesting that the area for the sale of refined salt be maintained and that no obstacles be placed in the way.</p>

<p>China United News Agency: Members of the Central Committee Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Jingjiang recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, inviting them to visit Sichuan. Li and others boarded the Minsheng Company Yongnian ship last night at 12:00 AM to go to Sichuan together. A reporter from the China United News Agency heard the news beforehand and drove to Li's residence at the World Academic Society on Fokerun Road at about 6:00 PM yesterday to interview Li about the mission to Sichuan. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wang and Li Meet: Li arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday. Recently, because he received Chiang Kai-shek's telegram inviting him to Sichuan, Premier Wang Jingwei specially came to Shanghai from Nanjing and visited Li at the World Academic Society at 10:00 AM yesterday morning for important discussions. Wu Zhihui visited Li at 2:00 PM in the afternoon but did not meet him, because Li was busy visiting various friends yesterday. Li also hosted a banquet at the World Academic Society at 7:00 PM, inviting Tang Zhongmin, inventor of the charcoal car, and Qi Yunqing of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, among others.</p>
<p>Departing for Sichuan Together: After receiving Chiang's telegram, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Jingjiang made all preparations to depart. Li arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Zhang originally lived in Shanghai, and Wu also rushed from Nanjing yesterday morning. They entrusted Qi from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to purchase four first-class tickets on the Minsheng Company Yongnian ship. The luggage was sent to the ship by staff around 7:00 PM in the afternoon. The three elders Li Wu Zhang, Zhang Jingjiang's wife, and Li's secretary Li Shaozhi boarded the ship at 11:50 PM last night.

<p>Li's Interview: After receiving the news, a reporter from the China United News Agency visited Li at the World Academic Society at 6:15 PM in the afternoon. Li was out at the time, and the reporter first met Li Shaozhi, Li's secretary. Initially, he denied the trip, but after the reporter confirmed the information, he admitted that they were indeed going to Sichuan, but did not express any opinion. Later, the reporter learned that Li was hosting a banquet at 7:00 PM, so he waited in the reception room of the society. Li returned from visiting friends at 6:35 PM, and the reporter immediately asked him about the mission and itinerary of the trip. Li initially expressed surprise and hesitated for a moment before replying that he would indeed depart for Sichuan tonight (that is, last night), but that it was for the nature of a pleasure trip and there was no other mission. He did not deny Chiang's telegram invitation and said that he would visit Chiang in Chongqing as convenient. As for whether he would visit Mount Emei, Mount Qingcheng, and Chengdu after arriving in Chongqing, he would decide after arriving in Sichuan. Li finally told the reporter that he would stay in Sichuan for about three weeks.</p>

<p>According to the Shen Times News Agency, several leading real estate developers in Shanghai, recognizing the current economic downturn and stagnant business, plan to revitalize the market through real estate ventures as a means of providing relief. A meeting was convened at 2:00 PM on the 17th at the residence of Cheng Linsheng, located at 1550 Jing'an Temple Road. Attendees included over eighty prominent real estate figures, including Cheng Linsheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Shen Tianxin, Wei Tingrong, Gui Yanfang, and others. Cheng Linsheng presided over the meeting. It was decided to establish a Commercial Economic Association with the aim of using real estate merchants as the core group to devise measures to alleviate the economic situation. Yu Qiaqing, Cheng Linsheng, and forty-three others were appointed as chairmen, and a number of directors were designated to draft the association's charter and outline in order to register with the authorities and obtain legal basis.</p>
<p>Proposed Issuance of 500 Million Yuan</p>
<p>In addition to discussing the establishment of the Commercial Economic Association, the meeting also addressed a major proposal: the issuance of 500 million yuan in currency notes. The plan involves setting aside 60% as cash reserves and securing the remaining 40% with real estate. The government would be asked to establish a deed depository. The justification for issuing 500 million yuan in currency notes is based on the belief that Shanghai currently holds 1 billion yuan in deposits. In order to circulate these deposits, the intention is to issue currency notes backed by real estate, thereby injecting vitality into the market. The proposed term for the currency notes is five years, with an annual interest rate of five percent.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Raising Reserves</p>
<p>Regarding the above proposal, the 40% real estate guarantee is not a problem, but the cash reserve aspect is particularly challenging under current circumstances. The current stagnation in Shanghai is due to a lack of mediums of exchange. Currently, the mediums of exchange in the market, besides cash, banknotes, and government bonds, cannot have a scope as broad as actual cash and banknotes. Currently cash reserves are also generally in a depleted state. Whether this large amount of currency notes can acquire the huge amount of cash reserve, enabling a part of stagnant real estate to be circulated in the market, is the most important question.</p>
<p>Banking Sector's Response</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Shen Times reporter interviewed several important leaders in the banking sector to ask for their opinions. Most of them expressed a silent attitude. However, in their private opinion, they believed that although this proposal was not without insight, it seemed to have various practical difficulties, because the preparation of cash reserve is difficult, and even after issuance, there may still be some difficulties in the circulation of the market in the future. Under the circumstances of credit crunch, the sudden appearance of such a large amount of paper money is difficult for the market to be responsible for.</p>
<p>Shen Tianxin's Remarks</p>
<p>According to the China Eastern News Agency, the Shanghai-based newspaper, the North China Daily News, reported that fifty real estate merchants held a meeting at Cheng Linsheng's residence the afternoon before last and decided to organize the Shanghai Commercial Economic Association to prepare for the issuance of 500 million yuan in currency notes to circulate in the market. A China Eastern News Agency reporter, recognizing the magnitude of the matter, visited Mr. Shen Tianxin, the director of the association, yesterday. According to Mr. Shen, the statement about issuing 500 million yuan in currency notes is not factual because the fundamental measures have not yet been determined. As for the original name of the association, it was originally the Shanghai Commercial Economic Research Association. The association was convened at Mr. Cheng Linsheng's residence at 3 p.m. the afternoon before last, and more than 120 people attended. Cheng Linsheng was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. The economic problems of Shanghai were discussed on the spot for three hours. It was said that Shanghai is the central hub of the national finance, and it has been hit the hardest. The state of tension during last year's large closures was very rare. At the beginning of this year, factories and commerce were the first to encounter difficulties, and credit loans became a formality. The newspaper reported that the money industry was unwilling to join the five million yuan silver group in written opinions. Silver reserves are drying up, and there is a shortage of capital. The funds released are not easy to recover for a while, and the real estate goods in hand are turned to others for mortgages, and they are subject to all kinds of criticisms. Therefore, it was studied that quite a lot of real estate in Shanghai has been pledged to the silver and money industries. A way out should be opened so that there can be more capital to circulate in the market, so that all industries can turn around. The money industry said that it had suffered a lot of pain in asking for help last year, and it also suffered for others. The purpose of this association is to assist the circulation of Shanghai's commercial economy. Now the name of the association is changed to the Shanghai Commercial Economic Association, and 45 directors are elected. In three or four days, members are asked to enter the association and send what they know to the association, so that the board of directors can collect everyone's opinions and prepare a presentation to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. It must also be agreed with the silver and money industries before a fundamental problem can be established. This is for the sake of more capital, not the principle of borrowing, so that the whole city can be dredged and all industries can be turned around, so as not to become a void. In the end, it was studied that the number of real estate in the whole port is very large. If it is not completely resolved, it is very worrying. Most of the directors elected are familiar with Shanghai's commerce and have rich experience.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Yesterday's "March 18th" Memorial Assembly, Representatives from All Walks of Life Met at the Municipal Party Headquarters <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the memorial day for the "March 18th" Popular Revolution in Peiping. The Municipal Party Headquarters held a memorial assembly in the auditorium at 10:00 AM, attended by representatives from all walks of life: (1) Everyone stood in silence; (2) Sang the Party Song; (3) Bowed three times to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the late Premier; (4) Chairman respectfully read the Premier's last will; (5) Observed three minutes of silence for the martyrs of March 18th; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Speeches; (8) Shouted slogans; (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Representatives Attending: Lin Kecong from the Municipal Women's Association, Bao Jiasheng from the First District Paper Industry Union, Ma Hanfeng from the Labor Education Association, Huang Xianggu from the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Yu Yaoqiu from the South Goods Industry Union, Wu Bao from Jianguo Middle School, Hu Shouqi from the First District Party Headquarters, and over one hundred staff members from various departments of the Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the formalities, Chairman Xing Wan gave a report, stating that in the spring of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Zhili-Lu Allied Army and the National Revolutionary Army were in a stalemate in the Pingjin area. The National Revolutionary Army placed mines at Dagu Port to prevent attacks by the Bohai Fleet and banned the passage of Chinese and foreign ships. A Japanese warship then sailed in without permission, causing a conflict with the defending troops. After the Dagu Incident, compatriots across the country were filled with anger. On March 18th, a National Assembly was held in Tiananmen Square to express firm opposition, and a petition was sent to the executive government to urge them to sternly reject the demands. However, the guards were instigated to open fire, resulting in the death of over fifty people, serious injuries to seventy or eighty people, and countless minor injuries. From this case, we can see that, first, since the reorganization of the Party in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, it has gained the deep trust of the people; second, the Premier's proposal to go north was not realized and he passed away in Peiping. The people of the north, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Party, were deeply angered by the corruption of the government at that time. Since the Dagu Incident, the general public has been motivated by righteous indignation to take this action, which fully demonstrates the spirit of revolution. This is because the Party's ideology has gained the trust of the people, and thus has this kind of power to express itself. After the report, the meeting adjourned after shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans: (1) Promote the spirit of the "March 18th" martyrs; (2) Down with imperialism; (3) Eliminate reactionary forces; (4) Complete local autonomy; (5) The spirit of the "March 18th" martyrs will never die; (6) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party; (7) Long live the Republic of China; (8) Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The New Life Movement Inspection Group's Activities in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Attended the Commemorative Week at the Headquarters in the Morning, Held a Discussion Meeting at the New Life Movement Association in the Afternoon, Today Inspecting Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the four-member New Life Movement Inspection Group from Nanchang arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday, they went to various places for inspection and worked very busily. Yesterday was the first day of work, and the inspection situation of the group is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Activities</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Inspection Group, consisting of four members, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, accompanied by Wu Kaixian, the chief executive of the New Life Movement Association, they met with Wu as commander in Longhua, and after attending the enlarged Commemorative Week, they inspected the headquarters and other places for a week. They were then accompanied to the New Life Movement Association, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Security Office, and the Special Party Headquarters of the Security Office for inspection. At 2:00 PM, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to attend the New Life Movement Executive Committee discussion meeting. After the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM, they went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for inspection. They visited various agencies, and the chief officers of each agency accompanied them on separate inspections, and the results were quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>General Welcome</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Association, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and their respective departments and bureaus welcomed the arrival of the New Life Movement Inspection Group. In addition to welcoming them at the station the day before yesterday, they also made large welcome banners and hung them in the air, which attracted attention. The New Life Movement Promotion Association held a banquet at the East Asia Restaurant at 7:00 PM last night to welcome Xu Qingyu, Yu Zhongqi, Lin Xueyan, and Zhang Yuchong, the four members of the inspection group. Mayor Wu and the executives of the New Life Movement Association accompanied them. During the banquet, Chief Executive Wu Kaixian delivered a welcome speech, and Xu Qingyu, the head of the inspection group, gave a reply. The banquet ended at 9:00 PM with joy.</p>
<p>Temporary Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the New Life Movement Association held an executive committee discussion meeting in the meeting room of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Wu Kaixian, Wu Xingya, Zhang Shouyong, Yang Hu, Yu Hongjun, Cai Jinjun (Chen Duzhen's representative, Pan Gongzhan, Lu Jingshi, inspectors Xu Qingyu, Yu Zhongqi, Lin Xueyan, Zhang Yuchong, Shen Liangzhong, Hu Tianseng attended, Chairman Wu Kaixian, record keepers Du Mengsen, Zhu Airen.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the formalities, the chairman first reported on the work status over the past year, which was divided into three aspects. The report was very detailed. The original words are very long, so they are omitted. Next, Executive Lu Jingshi reported on the organization and establishment of the New Life Movement Youth Service Corps and the situation of their departure for service. Then, Executive Yang Hu reported on the trends of the Municipal Security Office and the Special Party Headquarters in implementing the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Xu's Instructions</p>
<p>After the report, Xu Qingyu, the head of the inspection group, gave instructions, stating that Shanghai's local situation is complicated, and it is impossible to expect quick results in promoting the New Life Movement. There has been a major change in all aspects of the party, government, and society in Shanghai, which is very gratifying. Regarding the promotion of the New Life Movement, everyone should be responsible, especially civil servants who are in a leading position should lead by example. Secondly, the education sector is also the center of gravity for promoting the New Life Movement. Schools should take the opportunity to contact parents and promote the New Life Movement, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. As for the police, they have a greater responsibility for promoting the New Life Movement. The police themselves should receive strict training before they can supervise the people to implement the New Life Movement. I hope that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau will pay attention to this. Brothers represent Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to thank you for your past work and encourage you to work harder in the future to make Shanghai's New Life Movement a model for all provinces and cities.</p>
<p>Speeches by Pan and Wu</p>
<p>Later, Executive Pan Gongzhan reported, "Because my brother is serving as the director of the Education Bureau, I just listened to Mr. Xu's instructions, so I have a brief report. In terms of education, a branch has been established, and there are two ways to promote it in schools: (1) urge schools to organize branches, (2) although the schools are not completely established branches, because most of the schools in this city are elementary schools, it is difficult to handle all kinds of procedures, but the spirit of the New Life has been completely incorporated into the training. Not only are the training directors of each school responsible, but other teachers and staff are also responsible for supervision and implementation." Finally, Executive Wu Xingya gave a speech, stating that since the start of the New Life Movement, the work we have done has been mostly in spirit rather than on the surface. Shanghai's extravagant and frivolous habits cannot be corrected without promoting the New Life. However, promoting the New Life must go hand in hand with popularizing education.</p>
<p>Today's Inspection</p>
<p>Today's scheduled inspections are in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong. Executive Lu will accompany them. They are scheduled to depart at 7:00 AM, first to the Sixth District Party Headquarters on Datong Road, and then to the city center to inspect the Municipal Government, and the five bureaus of Society, Education, Health, Land, and Public Works. Then, they will transfer to the Seventh District Party Headquarters in Jiangwan, and Fudan University, the Eighth District Party Headquarters in Wusong, Tongji University, and Paotaiwan, etc. It is heard that after the training meeting at the Municipal Security Council tomorrow, they will visit schools and social education institutions in Xujiahui, Nanshi. It is heard that Xu is scheduled to take the 4:50 PM train to Hangzhou on the 22nd.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Ministry of Finance Issues Circular Clarifying Measures to Encourage Foreign Banks to Import Silver <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations received a circular from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the three measures formulated by the Ministry to encourage foreign banks to import silver have been approved and instructed to be notified to the association and to instruct the Chief Inspector of Customs to announce and implement them. In order to be more clear and avoid misunderstandings, the first item of the original measures is explained and the second item is supplemented as follows: (1) The first item of the original measures stipulates that an export tax exemption passport shall be issued for the original amount of silver or national currency. The so-called original amount refers to the amount of silver and national currency (each national currency shall be based on 23.493448 grams of pure silver) equal to the amount originally imported when re-exporting. It is not limited to the original imported silver and national currency. If re-exported in batches, this tax exemption passport may also be used, but it is limited to the amount listed in the original passport. (2) Those who hold the aforementioned tax exemption passport for export shall be exempt from the silver export tax and equalization tax levied since October 15, 1934, in addition to the 2.25% tax (national currency and Central Mint bars are also exempt from the 2.25% tax). In addition to informing the Chief Inspector of Customs to comply with the announcement, the association is hereby informed. This order.</p>

<p>Tea Party Held at the Ministry of Finance Office Yesterday, Speeches by Kong and Stuart</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi held a tea party at the Ministry of Finance office on West Ames Road at 5 p.m. yesterday to host alumni of Yenching University in Shanghai. Over 100 people attended, including Chen Liting, Qiao Fusan, Chen Binhe, Wang Kui Sheng, Guo Wanying, Qian Hua, Fang Fu'an, Nie Guangdi, and Liu Tingwei. Dr. Stuart, the provost of Yenching University, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping yesterday morning to travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong for inspections and to connect with alumni in South China. He also rushed to Kong's residence to participate in the grand event yesterday. Kong was delayed until 6 p.m. to attend due to the Bank of China's regular meeting. He shook hands with each of the attendees. Kong then gave a speech, saying, "Distinguished guests, students, I am very honored to have you take the time to attend today. This reception was originally scheduled for Tuesday, but because I have to go to Beijing tonight (i.e. last night), it was rescheduled for today. I heard that there are more than 200 Yenching alumni in Shanghai. Although these 200 alumni in Shanghai have different professions, their spirit of contributing to society is the same. Shanghai is a major trading port, and the nation's economy and commerce are concentrated here. Therefore, everything that happens in Shanghai can affect the entire country. Therefore, the alumni in Shanghai must have a great spirit of sacrifice for the Shanghai society and contribute more to the society. We must fully display the spirit of our alma mater and serve the country, because what China lacks most is talent. Often, there is a shortage of even a very ordinary talent in society. It is even harder to find talent who is selfless and puts the country and society first. I hope that all students will sacrifice themselves everywhere and give more beneficial contributions to the society and the country." Next, Stuart delivered a speech, reporting on the situation of the alma mater and the mission of this trip to the south. Finally, all the alumni sang the school song together. The guests and hosts dispersed with joy at about 7 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Liu Hongsheng and Others Return to Shanghai, Agreement Reached on Water-Land Intermodal Transport Case <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>When the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was handling the intermodal transport of the Longhai Railway on the Lao Yao Road, there was no conflict because there were few relationships with foreign shipping companies. After the continued realization of intermodal transport on the Jiaoji Railway and the Pinghan Railway, it aroused the aversion of foreign shipping companies in Shanghai, because the foreign shipping companies' voyages, tonnage, and business on the Yangtze River and the north-south ocean routes were larger than those of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. After the implementation of water-land intermodal transport, the goods transported from the railway were not loaded on foreign ships at all. The foreign merchants had to seek a way to save the situation because their business was greatly affected. The only way was to reduce the water freight. Wherever there was intermodal transport, the freight was reduced to even cheaper than the intermodal transport rate. The water freight from Hankou was reduced to only a few yuan per ton.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants' Demands</p>
<p>It is not a fundamental plan for the foreign shipping companies to compete for voyages by reducing fees. If they hold on like this, they will suffer losses from each other. Therefore, the foreign shipping companies in Shanghai, such as Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, have discussed it several times. As a result, they decided to use the Washington Nine-Power Treaty as a reason to make demands on us and join our country's water-land intermodal transport in order to obtain the benefits of distributing the national freight. The foreign merchants then submitted this intention to the governments of their respective countries, and the governments ordered their ministers to China to make a formal request to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Two-Ministry Meeting</p>
<p>After receiving this request, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs consulted with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways for verification. The ministers of the two ministries telegraphed to Shanghai to convene representatives of state-owned and private shipping companies to go to Beijing for a public meeting. Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Zhou Fengtu, director of the intermodal transport division, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Zhiyi of the Sanbei Company, Yuan Ludeng of the NingShao Company, Yang Guanbei of the Dada Company, and Li Zhiyi and Zhu Angsheng of other companies went to Beijing last Friday. On Saturday, a meeting was held at the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Railways also sent representatives to attend, and the matter was brought up for public discussion.</p>
<p>Decision on Measures</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, Zhou Fengtu, Li Zhiyi, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Zhiyi, etc. returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday, and Yu Qiaqing turned to the Beijing-Hangzhou Road to go to Ningbo. According to those who came from Beijing and Shanghai, the foreign shipping companies' request to participate in water-land intermodal transport was based on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and especially on the reason that the private shipping companies could participate. After discussion by the representatives present, it was decided that water-land intermodal transport was originally a connection between our country's state-owned railways and state-owned shipping, for the convenience of merchants and the reduction of transport rates and procedures. It was purely our country's internal affairs, and foreign merchants had no reason to make demands. Therefore, it was decided on the spot to refuse. As for the participation of Shanghai's private shipping companies, it was also agreed that they could only be affiliated with the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The dispatch of ships and the loading of goods were all controlled by the bureau. No other joint office was allowed to be established by the private shipping companies to justify their name and avoid excuses.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Today's Polish Community Celebrates Piłsudski <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Name Day Anniversary of the National Rebuilder, Meeting Held at the American Women's Association</p>
<p>Today (March 19) is the name day of General Józef Piłsudski, the Polish national hero and Minister of Military Affairs. The Polish Consulate in Shanghai is closed for one day as usual. At 6:30 PM today, all Polish residents in Shanghai will hold a celebration meeting at the American Women's Association at 577 Jing'an Temple Road. Polish Minister Wietow will attend and deliver a speech. General Piłsudski is the founding hero of Poland and has won the unanimous support of the whole country. He was born on December 5, 1867, in the small village of Zułów in northern Poland. He is now 68 years old. He studied medicine at a Russian university. At that time, Poland was divided by Russia, Germany, and Austria. Piłsudski's patriotic ideas were unusually strong. He gathered like-minded young people and often thought of restoring the freedom of his motherland. The Russian government sent police to closely monitor his actions. In 1887, he was sentenced to five years in prison and exiled to Siberia. When he returned after his term, he still gathered his former comrades to secretly carry out patriotic work. In 1894, he founded the Workers' Daily, which was secretly sold to promote the restoration of the country. In the end, he was chased by the authorities and fled to London. He met the current Polish President Ignacy Mościcki and made an unbreakable friendship. Piłsudski knew that the European War was about to break out and recognized this as an excellent opportunity to create Polish independence. He went to Kraków to organize a volunteer army. More and more people returned, and the momentum gradually increased. During the European War, Piłsudski used this volunteer army to resist Russia and fought for Polish independence, winning successive victories. Later, Germany and Austria wanted to use his volunteer army, but Piłsudski refused. In 1917, he was imprisoned by the German government in an army prison. The following year, the Great War ended and he was released. Poland also finally gained freedom with Piłsudski's efforts. Piłsudski immediately returned to his country to organize the government and sort out various military and political plans. He was elected as the leader of the provisional government. When the formal constitution was completed, although he was elected as the first president, he firmly declined and retreated to the position of Minister of Military Affairs, actively reorganizing the army. The military appearance became stronger day by day. In 1920, the Russian army that invaded Poland was repelled, and his reputation became more prominent. He was regarded as one of the strongest armies in the world. Poland has reached today mostly due to Piłsudski's contribution. Therefore, the whole country sings his praises endlessly. Today's commemoration, all Polish residents in the country and overseas unanimously hold grand celebrations.</p>

<p>According to the Shen Times News Agency, the China Aviation Company's newly purchased large Ford aircraft has been shipped from the United States to Shanghai last week. After being assembled at Longhua Airport, it was originally scheduled to conduct a test flight on the 16th of this month. However, due to the unclear air on that day, which hindered the flight, it could not be held. However, the company, with the Shanghai-Yunnan route urgently waiting to be opened, could not delay it for a long time. Therefore, the test flight work was held in the sky near Longhua Airport at 11:00 AM on the 17th. The company's chief pilot, Mr. Le Erxun, drove it and continued to fly in the sky for half an hour. Although it was a stomach rain flight on that day, the results were very good. At 11:30 AM, it landed safely at Longhua Airport. Yesterday, it was determined by the China Aviation Company that the test flight results of the Ford aircraft were excellent. It has now been decided to conduct a second test flight from Shanghai to Yunnan this weekend or early next week. The aircraft will first fly from Shanghai to Chongqing, and then take off from there through a mountainous section of the journey. If everything goes well at that time, the company has decided to officially open the route on January 1st. In the first month of opening the route, it will not carry passengers for the time being, only mail and packages, to ensure safety.</p>

<p>Total of 100 Vehicles</p>
<p>The PingSui Railway line, Zhu Jing, has smooth cargo transportation, especially food, which is the main cargo, resulting in insufficient original vehicles from time to time. In order to facilitate commercial transportation and expand business, the railway authorities specially requested the Ministry of Railways to add vehicles for application. The Railway Materials Committee ordered 100 covered wagons from China Copper Car Company on behalf of the railway. They will be delivered in Shanghai in the next few days, and Zhang Linmo, the mechanical engineering bureau of the railway, was appointed to come to Shanghai for acceptance. Engineer Zhang has arrived in Shanghai and is now inspecting them one by one. They will be dispatched to Peiping in five batches in the near future for distribution and application.</p>

<p>Recovering Sunken Gold from a Sailing Vessel</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, Mr. Gates, an American residing in Shanghai, aged 28, Mr. Rawling, aged 21, and Mr. Ritter, a German residing in Shanghai, aged 26, have planned to sail the 33-foot sailing vessel "Flying Dutchman" on April 1st. They will embark on a 15,000-mile journey to Cocos Island in the Indian Ocean to search for sunken gold. It is said that during the European War, the German cruiser Emden was sunk in that location by the Australian cruiser Sydney. The Emden had reportedly roamed the seas for months, attacking and seizing many ships, accumulating a significant amount of gold. Furthermore, in 1520, a Spanish merchant ship carrying millions of dollars in gold coins sank approximately 800 miles from Luderitz Bay in Southwest Africa. Six years ago, Mr. Ritter accidentally discovered its location. If they can find it, they are certain to return laden with treasure. The three young men estimate that the mission will take about a year. Along the way, they plan to first stop at the northern coast of Taiwan to stock up on supplies. Then, they will head to Babuyan Island off the northern coast of Luzon. It is said that the island has many women, with only one man for every twenty women. The three young men intend to investigate the truth of this claim. Next, they will pass through the Philippine Islands to explore gold mines in New Guinea. If they find anything, they plan to acquire equipment to harvest pearls in the world-renowned pearl-producing area off the northern coast of Australia. They also intend to explore Komodo Island, which is rumored to be inhabited by monstrous dragons and giant beasts. The three young men hope to capture their images. Mr. Gates previously served as an officer in the U.S. Navy, and Mr. Ritter recently worked as the Shanghai representative of a German maritime news agency. Mr. Rawling can dive to a depth of 60 feet without diving gear. Although their ship is small, it is very sturdy and comfortable, equipped with the latest navigational instruments. They will set sail under the German flag. Such young men can truly be described as embodying the spirit of adventure.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Silk Industry Bank Invites Zhang Naiqi to Speak on Financial Issues, Titled "Basic Conditions of Modern Financial Markets" <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank holds academic lectures from time to time to enhance the knowledge of its employees. Yesterday, it was time for the regular meeting, and the bank specially invited the famous economic expert Zhang Naiqi to give a lecture entitled "Basic Conditions of Modern Financial Markets." More than one hundred employees from the head office and branches attended the lecture, which was chaired by the bank's general manager, Wang Yansong. After the chairman gave an introductory speech, Mr. Zhang began his lecture. First, he stated that the task of the financial industry is to ensure the full circulation of funds in the market. Although the financial industry in our country has done its best to promote circulation in the past, it has not achieved the goal of full circulation. Its contribution is not enough to meet the actual needs of modern financial markets. Next, he mentioned the outdated investment methods of the financial industry as the main cause of financial panic. In the past, the lending methods of the financial industry were limited to two types: personal credit and property credit. Most of the loans obtained by industry and commerce from the financial industry were converted into accounts receivable from customers. As a result, what the banking industry obtained was the accounts receivable of industry and commerce, and what industry and commerce obtained was the accounts receivable of customers. Since these debts could not be transferred or mortgaged, the limited funds on the market were trapped in a stagnant stalemate, and market panic occurred. Finally, Mr. Zhang advocated that the financial industry should (1) complete a modern money market so that industry and commerce can obtain financing for working capital through bill discounting; (2) complete a modern capital market by converting all loans and mortgages from the financial industry to factories into the issuance of corporate stocks and bonds, so that the accounts receivable owned by themselves become securities that can be circulated and transferred. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the inherent money market and further provide industry and commerce with financing. As a result of the dual expansion of credit funds, it will not only be enough to save the temporary financial panic but also establish a permanent economic system. Mr. Zhang's narrative lasted for more than an hour, and the meeting adjourned at about 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>—Secretary-General Yu Instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to Handle—</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union has recently received petitions from workers of various factories, such as the Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 factories, Huafeng Flour Mill, and Minsheng Yarn Factory, stating that due to the factories' announcements of closure, the workers' livelihoods have been plunged into desperation. They have repeatedly appealed for resumption of work and submitted petitions to the party and government for relief, but no definite measures have been taken. They request prompt assistance. The union believes that the total number of workers in these factories reaches more than 10,000. If unemployment continues without resolution, it will inevitably affect social order. Therefore, yesterday morning, standing committee members Li Mengnan and Shao Xuzi were sent to the Municipal Government to petition Secretary-General Yu. Mr. Yu personally received them. First, the two members reported on the recent decline of general industry and commerce and the hardships of the city's workers' lives. Then, they stated that the workers of Shenxin, Huafeng, and other factories were in extreme panic due to the factories' closure and the indefinite postponement of work, which cut off the workers' livelihoods. They requested the Municipal Government to (1) order the factories to plan for resumption of work as soon as possible, and (2) provide food for the workers before work resumes. After hearing the situation, Secretary-General Yu expressed his utmost concern for the workers' suffering. He immediately notified the Social Affairs Bureau by telephone, ordering it to handle the matter properly and promised to make every effort to avoid the workers' suffering from unemployment. The two members were satisfied with the result and left.</p>

<p>Investigation revealed that a radio antenna line fell on a high-voltage overhead line. On the evening of the 11th of this month, there was a sudden power outage for one and a half hours in the area west of Kummen Road in the Shanghai West district. After investigation by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, it was found that someone at the Chung Shan Tong Chinese Pharmacy, No. 2778 Chung Shan Road, was installing a radio antenna on the roof carelessly, causing the antenna to fall on the 33,000-volt high-voltage overhead line, resulting in a short circuit and power outage. The person installing the antenna was injured at the time and sent to the hospital. Public utilities are closely related to the lives of the people. If a failure occurs, a portion of the citizens will be inconvenienced. The general public must be extra careful with electrical circuits to avoid failures and endangering themselves.</p>

<p>Since the exhibition of the 1935 models of various new cars manufactured by the Ford Motor Company of America opened last Saturday at the Meitong Motor Company, visitors have been flocking to see them. The next day was a regular Sunday holiday, and there were even more visitors. The Shanghai Ford Company, in view of the public's keen interest in the new cars, specially continued the exhibition for one day yesterday. Although the sky was overcast, men and women, young and old, came together in droves, undeterred. There were also many people who took test rides and test sits. It is said that the car rides very smoothly and comfortably, and sitting in the rear compartment is no different from sitting in the front compartment. Whether turning quickly or slowly, there is no feeling at all, because the rear seat is close to the center of the entire car and has the advantage of gravity balance. In addition, the tires are large and the wheels are small, so even on rough roads, there is very little bumpiness. As for the modernization of its lines and the novelty and luxury of its decoration, they are secondary.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Construction of Two Railway Lines, Completion of All Shanghai-Nanxiang Double Tracks <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Two New Stations, Chung Shan Road and Hsinchiao, Added Along the Platforms, Reported to the Railway Department for Commencement of Traffic on April 1</p>
<p>The Two Railway Administration previously proposed to lay double tracks along the entire line in order to facilitate traffic due to the congestion of passenger transport on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. However, due to the huge cost of the project, they first started construction at Shanghai-Nanxiang. Since the start of construction last year, they have been working actively and spare no effort. Now, this project has been completed, and only a part of the gravel project is being rushed to completion. It is expected that it will be completed within days and traffic will begin. Therefore, travel between Shanghai and Nanxiang will be exclusively by small steam trains, which will borrow the vehicles currently running on the Songhu Railway and will be integrated with the Songhu Express. A new platform will be opened at the North Station specifically for these vehicles. It is also under construction. Two stations have now been decided to be added between Shanghai and Nanxiang, namely Chung Shan Road Station between Shanghai and Chenju (i.e., between Shanghai and Chenju), and Hsinchiao Station between Chennan (i.e., between Chenju and Nanxiang). The construction of these two stations will also be completed. The new stations are shaped like tram platforms, specifically for passengers to get on and off, and there is no office or ticket office. Tickets are sold on the train, and the fare is very low. The price from Shanghai directly to Nanxiang is only 25 cents, but there may be changes when traffic starts in the future. The Railway Department has already submitted detailed reports on the Yinghang train plan to the Ministry of Railways. It was originally planned to commence traffic on March 10, but because the instructions from the Ministry of Railways have not yet arrived, it will be necessary to wait until approval before setting the date for commencement of traffic. According to the Huadong News Agency reporter, it will start on April 1.</p>

<p>Since the party department of the Two Railways sent personnel to reorganize the Trade Union of the Two Railways last month, the responsible personnel have been extraordinarily quick and intense in their reorganization work. All eleven branches of the entire railway have been established in order, and the elected responsible personnel of the branches have also been sworn into office separately. The Changzhou branch recently held its inaugural meeting on the 17th, with more than 100 representatives and guests attending. The superior authorities also sent personnel to attend and guide the meeting. Qiu Yongang and other three people were immediately elected as the presidium to report on the preparations for the branch and to elect Tian Xingyuan, Cao Jinjie, and Mao Panfa as the branch's executive officers and Wang Maode and Jin Hai as alternate executive officers. The elected executive officers were then sworn into office and held their first executive meeting. In addition, the Ningbo branch also held a representative meeting on the same day to establish a branch.</p>

<p>On February 20 of this year, at 10:45 AM, Tu Chin-sheng, the compradore of the French Electricity and Water Tram Company at No. 249 Lupan Road in the French Concession, put 20,000 yuan in cash into two cloth bags, one containing 16,000 yuan and the other containing 4,000 yuan, and ordered Ch'in Jung-sheng (29 years old, from Changzhou), to take them out of the store and load them onto the company's own car to deposit them in a certain bank. Unexpectedly, as Ch'in carried the two bags out of the company's gate and stepped onto the car, four robbers suddenly rushed up, showed their pistols to intimidate him, and forbade him to make any noise. They robbed the cloth bag containing 4,000 yuan, carried the loot to a car pre-parked at the intersection of Kangti Road, and fled. The robbers fired two shots in the air as a warning before leaving. Later, the company reported the robbery to the French police and asked them to arrest the thieves and recover the stolen goods. Although detectives were dispatched to arrest the thieves, they were unable to apprehend them for a time. Until the evening of the 17th, the French police received a secret report from an informant through Chief Inspector Chin Chiu-lin of the Special Service Department, stating that the robbers who committed the robbery were hiding in a certain opium den in Fangchiao in the Chinese area, and the gang would definitely pass through Tafang Lane at 9:00 PM. Chief Inspector Chin immediately led detectives Tai Jung-chi, Chu Chu-tung, Wu Wen-kang, Hsu Yu-i, and Ma Yi-chih, together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau in charge of the area, and rushed to No. 25 Tafang Lane, Fangchiao at around 9:00 PM. They arrested the ringleader Ch'iu Yen-shou (24 years old, from Funing), Yang Yang (33 years old, from Chiangpei), and gang members Li Chung-hsin (24 years old, from Chiangpei) and Chu Han-chiang (28 years old, from Chiangpei). They confessed to robbing the French Electric Tram Company and committing multiple robberies in the French Concession. They also confessed that other accomplices were hiding in the New Tafang Hotel. The detectives sent the robbers to the Public Security Bureau and rushed to Rooms 8 and 14 of the New Tafang Hotel at No. 381 Aidoa Road to arrest gang members P'an Yu-ching (30 years old, from Hsu-chou), Liu Hsiao-ken (29 years old, from Changshu), Chang Te-piao (29 years old, from Muyang), Chao Chung-heng (34 years old, from Haichou), and Fan Yu-heng (32 years old, from Hsu-chou). They were taken to the police station and detained. Based on the confessions of the arrested robbers, they went to No. 30 Terh-run Lane, Nanshi Railway Station Road, and arrested the gang members Chou Kuei and Chou Lu, a married couple (the man is 25 years old and the woman is 27 years old, both from Chiangpei). They found two Browning pistols and sixteen bullets under the brick in the stove. They also went to No. 480 Fangsieh Road and arrested gang members Hsia Wen-fu (41 years old) and Hsu Yueh-cheng (37 years old), both from Chiangpei. They were sent to the Public Security Bureau and detained. The detectives worked all night and finished at 9:00 AM yesterday. Today, the five robbers arrested in the French Concession were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. They also asked the court to prepare a document to the Public Security Bureau to bring the eight male and female robbers detained there to court for detailed investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Negotiation and Settlement Between the Press Association and Lien Hua Company <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Journalists Association's Three Demands Fully Accepted/The "New Woman" Film Has Been Edited</p>
<p>The Shanghai Press Association previously received a joint proposal from its members stating that the content of the "New Woman" film produced by Lien Hua Film Company insulted journalists. The Press Association negotiated with the company, and Mr. Wang Boch'i and Mr. Ma Yin-liang acted as mediators. Lien Hua Company fully accepted the three demands of the Press Association, and the matter has been satisfactorily resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Initiating Negotiations</p>
<p>On February 9, the Press Association convened a meeting of its Executive Committee to discuss how to deal with the insult to journalists in the "New Woman" film produced by Lien Hua Film Company. It appointed Chien Hua, Chin Hua-pai, Chiang Chia-tao, and Chien Shuo as representatives to negotiate with Lien Hua Company and resolved to make three demands to Lien Hua Company: (1) all insulting points in the film should be removed; (2) an apology should be published in the newspaper; and (3) a guarantee should be made that such incidents would not occur again in the future. The four representatives went back and forth to negotiate with the Lien Hua authorities. Lien Hua initially agreed to accept the principles and discuss the details, but then suddenly said that the Press Association should submit its demands in writing, implicitly indicating that the first and third demands were accepted and asking to avoid the second demand for a public apology. The initial negotiations thus came to an end. Afterwards, the Press Association sent a letter to Lien Hua, making three demands: (1) to remove the insulting points; (2) to publish an apology to journalists across the country in the newspaper; and (3) to guarantee that such incidents would not occur again in the future. It was also resolved to appoint Chien Hua, Chin Hsiung-pai, Chiang Tsung-tao, and Chien Ts'ang-shuo as representatives to negotiate with Lien Hua Company. However, Lien Hua replied with ambiguous wording, still hoping not to publish a public apology and accepting the first and second demands. After discussion at the joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Press Association on February 16, it was recognized that Lien Hua's reply was insincere. It was resolved to take further action, and negotiations broke down.</p>
<p>Formation of Special Case Committee</p>
<p>On February 17, the Press Association reconvened an emergency joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees and resolved to form a special case committee, appointing Yu K'ung-wo, Ch'u Shao-i, Yen Tu-ho, Chin Hsiung-pai, Chien Ts'ang-shuo, T'ang Shih-ch'ang, Chiang Tsung-tao, Chin Hua-t'ing, Chiang Ch'uang-hou, Hang Shih-chun, Ho Hsi-ya, Hsiang Yuan-ts'un, Chien Hua, Chao Chun-hao, and Sun Tao-sheng as the fifteen members of the committee responsible for handling the Lien Hua case and determining the principles to be followed.</p>
<p>Mediation</p>
<p>On February 22, Wu Pang-fan, the business director of Lien Hua Company, personally visited Mr. Ma Yin-liang, the manager of Shen Pao, asking him to mediate. Mr. Ma accompanied him to Mr. , who agreed to Lien Hua's request to serve as mediator. Wang and Ma, together with Wu Pang-fan, went to the Press Association to discuss a solution. After several rounds of consultation on the advertising text, it was decided that Lien Hua would publish the following advertisement: "Our company's 'New Woman' film had insertions of journalists, which caused dissatisfaction among the Shanghai Press Association. We are deeply grateful to Mr. Wang Boch'i and Mr. Ma Yin-liang for their willingness to mediate. We have now removed the inappropriate sections in the film and have satisfactorily resolved the matter. We hereby announce." In addition, the mediators published an advertisement stating, "Wang Boch'i and Ma Yin-liang's announcement on the negotiations between the Shanghai Press Association and Lien Hua Film Company: Lien Hua Film Company's 'New Woman' film had insertions of journalists, which caused dissatisfaction among the Shanghai Press Association. After mediation by us, the company has removed the inappropriate sections in the film and sent a letter of apology to the Press Association. The matter has now been satisfactorily resolved. This announcement." On the one hand, Lien Hua Company formally apologized to the Press Association in a letter and guaranteed that such incidents would not occur again in the future. The original letter said, "Dear Sirs, our company's 'New Woman' film had insertions of journalists, which caused dissatisfaction among your association. Our company sincerely apologizes. The three proposed measures of your association, apart from the first measure to remove the relevant sections and the third measure to guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future, have already been declared in our previous letter of reply that we will comply with them. We hereby sincerely apologize. To the Shanghai Press Association."</p>
<p>The Editing Process</p>
<p>After the settlement of the negotiations, Lien Hua Company immediately edited the film. The Press Association appointed Chiang Chien-hou, Chin Hua-t'ing, Ho Hsi-ya, Chiang Tsung-tao, Huang T'ien-p'eng, and Chien Ts'ang-shuo as representatives. On March 14, at 10:00 AM, they gathered at the Central Grand Theater. Lien Hua Company gave a special screening of the edited "New Woman" film. After the representatives inspected it, they pointed out the points that should be supplemented and edited, and Lien Hua edited it again. The Press Association sent a letter to Lien Hua Company, agreeing that the unedited film would not be screened in theaters in this city or other cities in the future. This case was completely resolved.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the German office of the Public Concession's Works Department, stating: "Respectfully, we have received letters with the seals of the Chinese Women's Sports League, the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, and the Shanghai YWCA, stating that newspapers have reported that English Constable Staff of Putuo Road beat to death a female vegetable vendor, Zhao, at Yichang Road. The news has deeply saddened us. We believe that peddlers selling goods should be protected by police officers if they do not violate police regulations. Otherwise, they should be detained at the police station and dealt with according to the law. However, the English constable disregarded the situation and treated human life as child's play, not only lacking humanity but also disregarding our national laws. Our associations, in order to maintain social peace and the happiness of our female compatriots, find it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we specially send this letter, earnestly requesting your association to seriously intervene to uphold the law and protect the lives of the people," etc. We are correspondingly sending another letter to your bureau, requesting that you investigate the three items in the previous letter and handle them promptly to quell public anger.</p>

<p>Ma Pan Denies Performing Abortion; Zhang Baiyong Detained Pending Verification</p>
<p>Zhang Baiyong, a 39-year-old man from Suzhou, worked at the Guangming Glass Car Side Factory. Recently, he became acquainted with a widow named Lu Fang, and they cohabitated at 156 North Fujian Road. After several intimate encounters, she became pregnant. Ms. Lu, being a widow, felt that being pregnant would be embarrassing, so she discussed it with Zhang. A few days ago, they hired Ma Pan, a 76-year-old midwife from Jiashan residing at 622 Chengda Lane, Tian Tong Road, to perform an abortion. After taking the medicine, the fetus was indeed aborted, but Ms. Lu experienced severe abdominal pain, which worsened daily. Zhang Baiyong was at a loss and, on the 15th of this month at 10 PM, sent her to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, she died before reaching the hospital. Upon examination, the hospital determined that she died from an abortion and reported it to the Huishi Police Station. Detective Tao Genrong and Western Detective Gibson were dispatched to take the body to the Philen Road autopsy center for examination. Midwife Ma Pan and Zhang Baiyong were arrested and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the situation, saying that the abortion fee was agreed upon at 35 yuan, with 18 yuan paid in advance. However, Ma Pan denied performing the abortion at the police station, claiming she only assisted with the birth and received 5 yuan. Since the autopsy had not yet been performed, he requested that Zhang and Ma be detained. Upon questioning, Ma Pan claimed that she was a midwife. Zhang hired her to go to his house, where she saw that it was a miscarriage. The child had already been born, but the placenta remained in the abdomen, and there was still unclean discharge, so she gave medicine to clear the discharge, receiving only 5 yuan. After Judge Qian Hongye questioned Zhang Baiyong briefly, he ordered Zhang to be detained until Friday for further questioning. Ma Pan was released on 500 yuan bail pending the autopsy. Meanwhile, Prosecutor Guo Wei arrived to examine the body and, after a brief inquiry, ruled that the deceased, Lu Fang, died from an abortion. Ma Pan and Zhang Baiyong were suspected of committing a crime and should be prosecuted by the police station in court. The body was handed over to the corpse caretaker, Lu Ni, who was instructed to prepare the coffin and burial.</p>

<p>Qi Xifu, a resident of 184 Eight Lane Head, Tao Peng Road, whose sixteen-year-old daughter Jin Di, works in the fine yarn department of the Hengfeng Yarn Factory on Washington Road, and Lin Guangyao, a twenty-year-old male worker (also from Changzhou) residing at 142 Fenzhou Road, in the same department, have fallen in love and secretly pledged their lives to each other. However, the girl's father disagrees. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month around 5 PM, Lin was waiting at the factory gate when the girl was going to the factory for the night shift. He took her to the North Railway Station to buy a ticket and asked his uncle, Lin Hai, to accompany her by train to the Lin family's house in Xihanglin Village in the countryside. He eavesdropped on the movements of the girl's father in Shanghai. If there was no trouble, he would return to the countryside to marry the girl. The case was discovered and the Yulin Road Police Station, Officer 649, arrested him and took him to the police station, then to the First Special District Court. Because Jin Di was in the countryside, she could not identify him, so it was ordered to detain him for further verification. During the period, Lin's father was anxious, and had his younger brother Lin Junyao rush to Changzhou to the family's house to bring Qi Jin Di back to Shanghai and return her to her father. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi personally presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Li Zhishan, recounted the past situation and asked for an investigation. According to the girl, Jin Di, she had indeed discussed the matter with the defendant beforehand and was temporarily staying at his home in another place, willing to marry him. She had no physical relationship with him. Her father did not know about this and did not mention it before she left. However, the girl's father, Qi Xifu, insisted that the girl wanted to follow him, but he did not agree. According to the defendant's younger brother, Lin Junyao, he proved the situation of bringing Jin Di back to Shanghai and returning her to her father. When questioned, the defendant's confession was ambiguous and he asked for leniency. Judge Jiang ordered him to be detained and scheduled the verdict to be announced at a later date.</p>

<p>Zhou Ronghui (also known as Ai Hua), a young woman from Jinshan in her early twenties, came to Shanghai from her hometown last February because her elder sister had married Wu Dajin and lived in Shanghai at 118 Dengtuo Road. She asked her brother-in-law to find her a job and stayed temporarily at Wu's house. Later, she occasionally went to see a movie at the Huade Grand Theatre, where she sat next to Zhu Dajun, a member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of Russian nationality. Zhu coveted Zhou's youth and beauty and took the opportunity to flirt with her. Zhou initially ignored him and quietly left her seat and returned home. However, Zhu was skilled in seduction and was not deterred by her rejection. Instead, he happily followed her, talking incessantly and boasting about his family background. When he saw Zhou's amorous glances, he intensified his offensive, eventually seducing Zhou. From then on, Zhou's chastity was violated. The Wugong Hotel on Fuzhou Road and the North Railway Station Hotel on Jielu Road were the havens for this pair of illicit lovers. Until last summer in July, Zhu's printing house was located far away at 61 Minhou South Lane, Hadong Road in West Shanghai. Meeting each other was inconvenient, and to save on travel expenses, they rented a house at 55 Zhengming Lane, Hede Road,</p>
<p>Cohabiting as Husband and Wife. Zhou was unmarried, and Zhu repeatedly claimed to have never been married, so they did not need the six rituals and immediately forged a bond for three lifetimes. Unexpectedly, on January 11 of this year, Zhu suddenly led a group of men and women into Zhou's bedroom, first violently beating her, then moving and taking away her clothes, and then leaving with his head high. Zhu has never returned since. Afterward, Zhou felt</p>
<p>Injured from the Beating, besides reporting to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, she cried and returned to her sister's house. Her brother-in-law, Wu Dajin, sent a letter to her mother, Zhou Zhang, asking her to rush to Shanghai to investigate. He found out that Zhu Dajun had already been married by his parents. The men and women who committed the assault were Zhu's parents and wife. Zhou Zhang felt that her daughter, Ai Hua, who was not yet twenty years old, had been seduced and defiled by Zhu and then humiliated by his gang beating her, which was intolerable. She was about to</p>
<p>File a Lawsuit, but Zhu struck first, filing a criminal self-lawsuit against Zhou for stealing and defrauding her of property, claiming that the woman was already twenty-three years old and that he had met her at Wing On Company. This time, taking advantage of his departure from Shanghai, she stole his watch, gold jewelry, silver dollars, and Volunteer Corps firearms. Zhou Ronghui, along with her mother, Zhou Zhang, hired lawyer Zhang Li to, in addition to</p>
<p>Defending Themselves According to Law, claiming that all the allegations made by Zhu were fabricated and requesting dismissal, filed a counterclaim, recounting the details of being seduced, defiled, and beaten by Zhu, demanding punishment according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special District Court held a hearing to examine the original and defendant parties. First, Zhu Dajun stated the intention of his lawsuit. Then, Zhou Ronghui presented in court a letter of repentance written by Zhu himself, proving that she had been repeatedly beaten and abused by Zhu and that Zhu had no watch or gold jewelry. As for the firearms, Zhou stated that Zhu had accidentally dropped them when taking the items, and she had sent them to the police station. Judge Zhan ruled that Zhu Dajun had only sued Zhou Ronghui and had not included Zhou Zhang as a defendant, so Zhou Ronghui's counterclaim against Zhu Dajun was not necessary to be added as the plaintiff, and the portion of the counterclaim concerning disrupting the family did not fall under the jurisdiction of the primary court. These two points were rejected, and Zhu Dajun was ordered to post 200 yuan bail, and Zhou Ronghui was instructed to submit to a forensic examination for further investigation.</p>

<p>At Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, the second post policeman Sun Wende of the Xuhui Police Station, was on duty on the sidewalk in front of Dechang South Goods Store in Xujiahui Town yesterday afternoon around 5 PM. Suddenly, Bai Erpi Ai (transliteration), a police head of the French Concession Beidang Road Police Station, prohibited Policeman Sun from being on duty there because the sidewalk belonged to the French Concession and must be on duty on the street. Sun Wende replied that he was ordered by his superiors and had been on duty in the middle of the road here before. You say it belongs to the Concession. I don't know in which year and by whom it was ceded to you. You can negotiate with our station. At that time, the onlookers were indignant. The police head then went with the interpreter to the Xuhui Police Station and met with Director Hong, reporting the above situation. Director Hong replied that the center of the road has always been guarded by Chinese police. In the winter of the year before last, there was a problem due to the installation of tap water pipes. So far, the boundary has not been determined by superiors. In order to avoid disputes and maintain friendship between the two sides, the second post at that location has been temporarily moved to the sidewalk. Now it is not allowed to pass through the location and no post is allowed to be set up there. It is too much to force us to be under the corridor. Moreover, this area cannot abandon its duties. Before receiving orders, we will temporarily continue as before. As for the boundary, it will be clarified after the two sides confirm it.</p>

<p>Tang Yuqing, a native of Yancheng, used to cultivate land in his hometown. Because of the bankruptcy of the countryside, it was difficult to maintain a livelihood. He had no choice but to bring his wife, Sun, to Shanghai in 1920 to earn a living. They rented a house in Tanziwan, Zhabei. Tang made a living pulling a rickshaw, while Sun worked as a domestic helper. Although they were engaged in low-level work, they were still carefree and had no worries about food and clothing. In 1932, Tang Yuqing returned to his hometown on business. Unexpectedly, he never returned and there was no news from him. Sun was deeply anxious because she had not heard from him for a long time. There was a fellow villager, Zhou Cao, who was helping out in the neighboring house. They met day and night, so they knew each other and had a fellow villager relationship. They were exceptionally intimate and became close friends. Zhou Cao, because Sun's husband Tang Yuqing had been missing for a long time and Sun was living alone, thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of. So, she incited her in every way to remarry. Sun was ultimately young and allowed Zhou Cao to arrange things. In August of that year, with Zhou Cao's stockholders Fa Zhou Zaozhi and others as matchmakers, she remarried Cheng Yuqian, a puller from Funing, as his wife, and had a marriage certificate with a dowry of 120 yuan. More than three years passed. Now Tang Yuqing suddenly rushed to Cheng Yuqian's house and dragged Cheng and Sun to the police station. He also obtained the witness of Zhou Zaozhi (Zhou Cao's business partner Yin Changfa fled upon hearing the news) and brought them to the district court. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu's investigation was clear, and he prosecuted the criminal court for bigamy. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Judge Shao Qinzhi held a trial and ordered Tang Sun, Cheng Yuqian, Zhou Zaozhi, etc., who were in custody, to come to the case for a long time. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu also attended the court to argue. Finally, the defendant's lawyer Sun Wu rose and defended him. The judge considered the case concluded and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2 PM on the 23rd of this month. The three defendants were sent back to jail to await instructions.</p>

<p>Dong Wenxiang, a 20-year-old man from Rugao, was working at the Ningbo Yuanhexianghao. For some unknown reason, he suffered a nervous breakdown. The store urged his mother to go to Ningbo and accompany him on the Jiangtian Steamboat to Shanghai. Then he transferred to the Xiaochangjiang Bandahao cargo ship to return to his home in Rugao. When the ship sailed out of the Wusong Estuary, near the Changyinsha River, Dong had a major nervous breakdown and, taking advantage of the lack of preparedness, jumped into the river to commit suicide. The ship stopped and tried to rescue him, but the body could not be found. A request has now been made to the Lifesaving Bureau to search for him.</p>

She had just arrived in the city on a fast train in the evening, but she was alone and had no luggage. She was led into room number nine by the receptionist. After bringing tea, she closed the door. Not long after, there was a miserable cry of pain coming from the room. The waiter discovered it and pried open the door. He saw that her expression had changed and she had barely any breath left. Knowing that she had undoubtedly taken poison, he reported it to the Huishi Police Station and summoned an ambulance. She was rushed to the Bazilu Sanitarium for treatment. It is said that her life is in great danger.</p>

<p>Wang Lianxiang Dies After Being Injured; Guo Liyu Flees the Scene</p>
<p>Captured by the Police Station and Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Wang Lianxiang, a sixteen-year-old boy from Nantong, is an apprentice at the Xinwanxing Cake and Dim Sum Shop, opened by Li Changsheng from Pudong, at 129 and 131 Ximen Road in the French Concession. He has been there for three years and will be fully apprenticed in April of this year. Guo Liyu, a 39-year-old man from Anhui, residing at 107 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, makes a living selling cold noodles. On the 16th, Guo stopped his stall in front of 175 Malong Road to do business. Around 7 PM, Wang Lianxiang was sent out by the shop to collect the noodle bowls that were delivered the day before. When passing Guo's cold noodle stall on Malong Road, he saw Guo's fourteen-year-old son, Xiu Cai, nearby. Wang immediately pulled Guo's child to play with him, accidentally hitting Xiu Cai's head and causing it to bleed profusely. At that time, Guo Liyu saw his son suffering and bleeding and immediately rushed up to help his son, grabbing Wang Lianxiang, punching and kicking him, causing him to be injured. In fright, Wang returned to the shop and went upstairs to bed. At that time, the owner of Xinwanxing Cake and Dim Sum Shop did not know that Wang had been beaten outside. Guo, after Wang left, sent his son to a nearby doctor for bandaging. Then, he went to the Xinwanxing Cake and Dim Sum Shop, asking the shop owner and Wang for compensation for medical expenses. At this point, the owner of Xinwanxing Shop learned that Wang had caused trouble outside. He went upstairs to call him but received no response. When he went to the bed to check, he saw that Wang's face was pale and he could not open his mouth to speak. Knowing that he had been seriously injured, he reported it to the French Police Station, and the detective sent Wang to Guangci Hospital for treatment in a car. Guo Liyu, seeing that he had caused trouble, immediately fled with his family. Wang Lianxiang, after being sent to the hospital, died due to the severity of his injuries at 5 AM the next day. The hospital notified the French Police Station, and the detective took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall autopsy center. Meanwhile, Jin Jiulin, the detective inspector of the French Police Station, ordered detectives Zhou Buguang, Tu Zhixiang, Zhang Chunsheng, and Yang Jiayi to arrest the murderers, Guo Liyu and his son Guo Xiucai. After searching everywhere, they were arrested at 311 Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, and taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday, the police station summoned the family of the deceased and reported to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and medical examiners Wei Jiang arrived at the autopsy center at noon to examine the body of the deceased. Because there were no obvious wounds on the outside, the official interrogated the defendant and his son and instructed them to wait until the afternoon to dissect the body to verify it before further investigation. Subsequently, the police station sent the defendants Guo Liyu and Guo Xiucai to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated the case, saying that the police station had not yet investigated the case of the defendants causing death by injury in detail, requesting a postponement, and temporarily detaining the defendants until the case was clarified and prosecuted. When questioned, the defendants and their son shirked their responsibilities and denied the crime. Then Deng Ren Li Changsheng (owner of Xinwanxing Shop), Sun Jiangsheng (bookkeeper of Xinwanxing), and the uncle of the deceased, Wang Fuqing, and others testified. Judge Wang Chouxu checked the testimony and ordered a retrial on the 22nd. The defendants were sent back to jail to await instructions. At 2:30 PM, Prosecutor Wang still accompanied medical examiners Wei Jiang and Secretary Zhao and others to the site to dissect the body in detail. The result determined that the deceased, Shuxiang, had indeed died from being beaten before his death. The deceased's father was still in the countryside, and the shop had sent a letter to notify him, saying that he could arrive in Shanghai today. The official then ordered the body to be temporarily handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial and ordered the police department to hand it over to the court for handling according to law.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Medical Community Observes: Yao Jinping is a Pseudo-Masculinized Female; A Similar Incident Occurred in Hangzhou Five Years Ago <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The case of Yao Jinping, a woman from Tianjin who transformed into a man, has attracted the attention of all walks of life. Therefore, many people went to admire Yao's demeanor yesterday morning. At the same time, members of the medical community also went to visit.</p>
<p>Various Circles of Curiosity Compete to View</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the citizens of this city, driven by curiosity, competed to view Yao Jinping, the woman who transformed into a man, at 18 Caitao Lane, Julu Road. There was a continuous stream of people. Yao's grandparents felt overwhelmed by the social calls. Gynecologist Dr. Mao Wenjie also went to Yao's residence at 10 AM yesterday to inquire. He requested an examination, but Yao, because her female form had not been completely eliminated and it had only been five months since the transformation, agreed to go to Mao's clinic for examination within this week.</p>
<p>The Male Organ is Slightly Different from Ordinary People</p>
<p>Mao then examined her by feeling through her pants. According to Mao's statement to the Huadong News Agency reporter, it is "female pseudohermaphroditism," which is commonly known as a female incubating a male. Yao's male organ, after it developed (i.e., after the transformation), is slightly different from ordinary men. It seems to have only a clitoris and no testicles. The penis is on the clitoris. The foreskin can be turned back and feels hard to the touch, but there is a lot of vaginal discharge, and the pants smell of a certain odor. Her breasts are larger on the right and smaller on the left, still in the form of a woman.</p>
<p>A Similar Incident Occurred in Hangzhou</p>
<p>According to Mao, in 1930, the Tongren Surgical Hospital on Qingnian Road in Hangzhou also had a Shaoxing person who was originally male, but suddenly fell seriously ill and found that his male organ had shrunk and had female physiological changes such as menstruation. Dr. Wang Jiren of the hospital used scientific methods to artificially create a female internal reproductive organ. After recovering from the illness, he returned to Shaoxing.</p>
<p>French Inspector-General Receives Yao and his Grandfather</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, Chinese and foreigners alike considered it a marvel. The French Concession Lujiiawan Police Station dispatched detectives to the General Police Station yesterday morning to have Yao and his grandfather questioned by Inspector-General Folangdeng (transliteration) about the transformation. After a long secret inquiry, they were ordered to withdraw. The details could not be ascertained because officials were not allowed to listen.</p>
<p>Will Return to Tianjin Within This Week</p>
<p>Yao came to Shanghai with his grandfather, Mr. Qingpu, at the invitation of General Li Du. Yao was eager to find his father and planned to follow the families of the anti-Japanese soldiers and transfer to Xinjiang in the shortest possible time to fulfill his wish to find his father ten thousand miles away. Now Li persuaded him to return to his original residence in Tianjin for further study, so it was decided that he would still be taken back to Tianjin by his grandfather within this week.</p>
<p>The View of Expert Wang Gu Ning</p>
<p>According to the Riri News Agency, Dr. Wang Gu Ning, a medical doctor from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium (specializing in pathological anatomy for more than 500 years), visited and requested an examination. Dr. Wang was the former surgeon at the Beijing Railway General Hospital and a neurologist at the Manchester Royal Hospital in England. He has a lot of experience in the study of the pathology of male and female physiology. According to him, the phenomenon of a woman turning into a man has already been studied by the medical community in the world. Many pathological anatomists have found (postmortem dissections) significant pathological conditions in the adrenal medulla and ovaries. The outer layer of adrenal tissue (Substance Corticale) is even more pronounced, so it is called adrenal masculinization (Virilisme Surrenalien). The onset of the transformation has no fixed symptoms, depending on age and temperate climates, and is closely related to physiology. According to scholars' observations, such pathological anatomical phenomena occur in five or six-year-old girls in temperate zones, whose genitals are like those of adult women, and menstruation also comes. If it belongs to a boy, with this disease, his genitals, physique, and psychology also become adult. If it belongs to an elderly woman, with this disease, her beard, voice, physique, etc., all become men. However, the external genitals become male, mostly belonging to young women who are about to become adults. The endocrine changes have been going on for a long time. Yao Jinping's transformation into a man upon hearing the sound of thunder is just a misperception or hallucination of that particular person, not a fact. There were also people like Yao Jinping in Europe in the past. In the police station, the gender on the residence permit was changed from female to male. However, in fact, the outside looks male, but the inside is still female. The reason for the change still needs detailed field research. Only in terms of the endocrine pathological anatomical abnormalities, or in addition to the above two types that have been proven, there should be many other pathologies that remain to be confirmed by physiology, pathology, anatomy, and other disciplines.</p>

This morning, Judge Mosu held a hearing and, after only fifteen minutes, sentenced the two defendants to fourteen years in prison, with hard labor, and ordered them to be escorted back to their native India.</p>

<p>The Municipal Dock Business Office, recognizing the extreme hardship of dockworkers' lives and their lack of attention to cleanliness and hygiene, which often leads to illness and death, has proposed to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government the establishment of a public bathhouse for workers to improve their health. Furthermore, the office has recently learned that the Municipal Government is borrowing funds to build affordable housing and has submitted a proposal to the Municipal Government requesting that a portion of these funds be allocated to build a new village for dockworkers at Lannidujiao in Pudong, dedicated to dockworkers to facilitate training. The aforementioned proposals of the office are all related to the vital interests of dockworkers, and it is hoped that the municipal authorities will assist in their realization during this time of promoting the New Life Movement.</p>

<p>(3) Production: The industrial production indices of non-gold standard countries have also shown an upward trend since 1933. Among them, Japan, due to the development of export trade, has seen a rapid leap forward since 1932. The indices for countries such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden have even exceeded the levels of 1928. The increase in production and export trade of certain consumer goods (such as textiles) in the United States and Canada has also slightly increased the indices. However, due to the extreme weakness of some major industries (such as the automobile industry), they have ultimately failed to keep pace with the United Kingdom and Japan.</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Brash Young Woman Reveals Wealth While Choosing Suitors; Lurking in the Shadows, Lovesickness Impairs Integrity</p>
<p>However, he knew in his heart that this was someone else's house, and the host had only gone to see a guest off and would be back immediately. If he lingered here, he would inevitably run into the host. At that point, not getting the money would be a minor matter; he wouldn't be able to stay in Xi'an City. The host would only see the guest to the front door and be back in a matter of moments, so it would be best to run away quickly. Once he made up his mind, he gritted his teeth, grabbed the edge of the table, and immediately stood up. Then, he grabbed the two stacks of silver dollars, regardless of the amount, along with the wrapping paper. There was no time to stuff them into his pocket; in fact, it was impossible to stuff them into his pocket. So, he pulled up his lapel and used it to hold the silver dollars. Once he had them secure, he grabbed the two bottom corners of the lapel and pinched them tightly. Even though he had been extremely afraid a moment ago, he now felt happy, finally getting a little extra money. Thinking of this, he turned around to leave. Unexpectedly, this time, he was scared out of his wits. A person was standing in the doorway, with both hands outstretched, blocking his way. It was none other than the host of this room, Master Jia Duocai. At first, he stared at the woman with both eyes wide open. When the woman's face turned green and she stood there dumbfounded, he raised his eyebrows and smiled slightly. Even though he had no beard on his mouth, he stroked his bare chin to show his satisfaction and said with a smile: "Who is it, I wonder? It turns out to be Miss Yang Huanhua! Since the day Mr. Li Shilian introduced us, we haven't had a second conversation. The money on my table, are you planning to take it away?" Yang Huanhua loosened her hands, and the silver dollars scattered on the ground with a crash. Jia Duocai smiled and said: "Besides selling yourself, you're also involved in this kind of thing. I didn't expect that. You've really let people down. What are you planning to do?" Yang Huanhua saw that he was still standing at the doorway, refusing to move aside, and realized that the situation was not good. So, she suddenly knelt down, looked at him with tears in her eyes, and said: "Mr. Jia, please don't shout. Listen to me. I was really forced to do this. I..." (159)</p>

<p>Sun Shiying Returns to Broadcasting After Recovery: Mr. Sun Shiying, a scholar of Chinese classics hired by the Youlian Radio Station on Avenue Joffre in this city, has been broadcasting for a year and a half. He provides insightful explanations of the Analects, Mencius, the Great Learning, and the Doctrine of the Mean, as well as ancient and modern prose selections. His clear and harmonious pronunciation has been praised by all sectors of society. Since the new year, he has been suffering from a severe stomach ailment and has stopped lecturing for many days. Western and Chinese medicine treatments have been ineffective. Recently, he invited Chinese medicine practitioner Chen Cunren to provide careful treatment, and he has gradually improved. It is said that he is scheduled to resume his lectures on Chapter 57 of the Lao Tzu at the Youlian Radio Station on the 22nd of this month. Mr. Sun said that Daoism is the crown of all schools of thought (Daoism is not Taoism, nor is it the Immortal School), and it is also from which Confucianism originates. Even foreign Buddhism must extract its essence. So-called Daoism, in fact, contains everything and transcends everything. The book Lao Tzu is extremely important, and especially practical in these times. It is indispensable for governing the world and cultivating oneself. Therefore, people who have created things and achieved tasks throughout history have mostly come from Daoism, while those who adhere to old rules have mostly come from Confucianism. This can be verified in historical records. This is what is meant by Daoism creating, Confucianism maintaining, and Buddhism ending.</p>

<p>— (Ben Shui)</p>
<p>People often use the phrase "wearing colored glasses" to describe people who judge things with prejudice, but this is actually a mistake. When you first wear colored glasses, you may not be able to distinguish the colors; everything looks red through red glasses and green through green glasses. But over time, you gradually learn to distinguish all colors and will not confuse red and green. You can ask anyone who is used to wearing colored glasses.</p>
<p>Dr. Wegel of the United States calculated that the money spent on World War I, if lost at the rate of one US dollar per second since the time of Confucius, would be sixty dollars per minute, three thousand six hundred dollars per hour, and eighty-six thousand four hundred dollars per day. Even if this continued for the past two to three thousand years, the total would only be half of what was spent on the war. If we start losing money again now, it would probably take another two to three thousand years to lose the same amount as was spent on the war. The cost of war is truly staggering!</p>
<h3 id="e182">A Brief History of the Longhua Pagoda <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>Among the more than two thousand pagodas dotting China's landscape, Longhua is one of the most famous; hence, almost all Chinese people know it. The construction of pagodas originated in India, entering China with the eastward spread of Buddhism. It has been over 1,600 years since China has had pagodas. However, although the pagoda construction system originated in India, the Chinese, with their ingenuity, have innovated designs that are very different from Indian pagodas. Moreover, geomancers consider them related to Feng Shui, and the whole world has followed suit, resulting in pagodas spreading throughout various regions. The pagoda styles in different parts of China are not uniform. Southern pagodas are superior in form and color, while northern pagodas appear simpler, often lacking carved railings in their corridors. However, their construction is extremely solid, with spiral staircases inside leading to the top. The height of pagodas varies from seven to thirteen levels, with the tallest pagoda in Dingzhou, Zhili, reaching 360 feet.</p>
<p>Over time, most of the earliest pagodas have collapsed and no longer exist. Those seen today, although some still stand majestically on their original sites, are mostly reconstructions from later periods. The Ming and Qing dynasties saw countless pagoda reconstructions. However, the construction of the Longhua Pagoda predates the Ming Dynasty by several centuries. According to the Shanghai County Annals, it was initially built during the Three Kingdoms period. At that time, Emperor Da of Wu controlled the Jiangbiao region, extending west to Wuchang and south to Minyue, possessing abundant resources. The pagoda stood for over 400 years until the Tang Dynasty, when it was renovated and the adjacent temple was named Longhua Temple, thus fixing the pagoda's name. Not long after, Huang Chao's rebellion destroyed both the temple and the pagoda by fire. It was not until more than 200 years later that the Qian family established the state in this area, known as Wuyue. When King Zhongyi ascended the throne, he ordered Zhuang Wu to have Zhang Rentai oversee the reconstruction. It is said that King Zhongyi, while sailing on the Huangpu River, anchored in the river at night and saw a light in the sky, shining at the site of the old pagoda, which he considered an auspicious sign, hence the order. The pagoda that stands tall today as a landmark of Shanghai is this one.</p>

<p>— Shi Duan</p>
<p>As soon as it rains, a lot of mud squeezes onto the roads. Where do they hide on sunny days? It's really strange. As soon as pedestrians step out, these nasty little things cling tightly to your feet, making you feel particularly disgusted, just like ordinary people hate those arrogant bigwigs. This is a unique flavor of Nanjing in the rain. I have been to Hangzhou, to Shanghai... but there is nothing more unpleasant than a rainy day in Nanjing. As soon as I see dark clouds spreading, my heart is lightly pressed with a layer of aversion.</p>
<p>Originally, Nanjing is mostly desolate and quiet. Once drizzled with sorrowful rain, Nanjing immediately sinks further into a lonely well. I ask those who have been to Nanjing, what impression did the rain give them?</p>
<p>Those cars, once it rains, rush wildly across the streets, speeding arbitrarily, and the sounds of their horns are so arrogant, especially on rainy days, it is simply a threat to all the lonely rickshaws or horse carriages.</p>
<p>The rain in Nanjing, I feel terrible just thinking about it. What's terrible is those muds that I don't know where they hide on sunny days, and after the rain, they immediately squeeze onto the roads to confront pedestrians' feet. But I also thought of a short story by Tolstoy: "The Waves of Freedom." Although the mud is small, it also has its perseverance and freedom (life). How can we ignore them, great life!</p>

<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>When I was a child, while helping my grandmother start the fire and cook, she would sometimes say to me, "The flint is used up, baby. Listen for the flint vendor, call him to buy a new one." I liked hearing this in my little ears. The next day, I would carefully listen for the "ta-la-ta" sound, because this was a great opportunity for me to buy a clay Buddha figurine to play with. Usually, my grandmother would rarely buy me toys, so the only hope I had was when buying new flint, I dared to ask to buy one to play with. That's why I paid close attention to the flint vendor when I was a child.</p>
<p>The flint vendors from Jiangbei would row a small boat to our Dongshan. The men would always be leatherworkers, and the women would carry flint baskets to sell flint in the villages. They would hold two clam shells in their fingers, knocking them together with a "ta-la-ta" sound. They not only sold flint but also collected shoes to have their husbands put soles on them. According to my grandmother, the clay Buddha figurines were newly added when I was learning to walk.</p>
<p>Flint was gradually defeated by matches, and they added needles and thread to their baskets. But recently, when I returned to my hometown, the goods in their baskets had changed again. Besides needles and thread, they had almost become general merchandise vendors, adding socks, stockings, handkerchiefs, rouge, and cosmetics. What stung my eyes the most was that clay Buddha figurines were rarely seen, replaced by toys from some country with English writing on them. Here, I saw that the women in our remote Dongshan were also learning to be fashionable, and I also felt that the omnipresent toys from some country had also penetrated my hometown.</p>

<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>In the daily conversations between husband and wife, sometimes one party needs to express empty comfort — just like the so-called "lip service," only to adapt to the environment; the other party, however, hopes that you will show this little comfort at the appropriate time, and they will feel grateful and content! This does not mean that there should be any false affection between loving partners living together, but it all relies on this little procedure to connect and integrate the inspirations of both parties, which cannot be avoided. Otherwise, often even if you are trying your best to do practical work of consolation, because you don't scratch the itch, you still can't get the other party's comfort or sympathy. Just look: "In the Changmen Palace, no dressing up all day, why bother with pearls to soothe loneliness?" A bushel of bright pearls only gets unexpected few lines of resentful poetry in return, isn't it not worth it!</p>
<p>Also, sometimes a request made by one party is satisfied just by getting a verbal permission from the other party, and there is no real need to see it implemented; because that request — whether it is giving or accepting — only serves the purpose of testing love or probing sympathy. Under such circumstances, you can't avoid casually going along with it, and rest assured that there will be no difficulties following.</p>
<p>For example, one day, the wife was hurriedly putting on makeup before going out, and she shouted anxiously because she couldn't draw her eyebrows to her satisfaction: "Why can't I draw them well no matter how I try!"</p>
<p>At this time, the husband was dealing with other things on the side, and he chimed in and said, "Let me draw them for you."</p>
<p>"Okay," the wife replied, while continuing to draw them herself, without stopping to wait for her husband to come and help. But strangely, the situation suddenly turned smoothly, and she quickly completed her work; she felt very satisfied!</p>
<p>Just imagine, when the wife was feeling frustrated and couldn't help but shout it out, how anxious she was in her heart! If the husband was afraid of further disturbing her work and remained silent, wouldn't this silent environment cause her to misunderstand, thinking that he was deliberately standing by and not wanting to help? By saying this, "Let me draw them for you," at least the wife knows that he cares about her beauty! Moreover, a husband drawing his wife's eyebrows has always been recognized as a joy in the boudoir; such a romantic and considerate impression, once awakened by him, will produce an incredible effect of regulating bad emotions and comforting her heart! Does it matter whether things are actually done or not?</p>
<p>As for the sentence "Let me draw them for you," which you casually say but contains a request; he himself may not be sure whether he can quickly and effectively take over this eyebrow-drawing task. The wife also knows this situation, and may even know that he will definitely not be able to do it well, and her original intention is really not to cause more trouble for him; but how can she directly and frankly refuse his courteous offer? She had no choice but to casually respond, as if accepting his kindness. In this way, her good habit of not being aggressive when she is upset shows her extreme love for her husband, and at the same time, his comfort can make her mood more peaceful, and her eyebrows are finally drawn!</p>
<p>The tiniest details of what husband and wife hear are related to how grand the environment is. I advise all married people that these things are really not to be ignored!</p>
<p>The two novels today should be switched with those of yesterday, specifically for correction.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although I was so nostalgic, according to what I later discovered, these girls who were careful about raising silkworms—most of them were daughters of bannermen—really liked silkworms; so sleeping with silkworm eggs in their arms was commonplace and not worth fussing about.</p>
<p>While I was vaguely imagining what it was like to sleep with silkworm eggs in my arms, the Empress Dowager spoke again.</p>
<p>"Look! Aren't these newly hatched?" She went to another corner of the room. "But they grow very quickly, you can almost watch them grow; in about seven or eight days, they will start feeding on large mulberry leaves."</p>
<p>Here, several wooden shelves were placed with many round, low plates, which were made of bamboo, and part of the bottom of the plates was made of very smooth bamboo pith; their edges were about an inch and a half high and were also tied with bamboo strips. These bamboo plates were different in size, and must have had different uses. As I saw it, the newly hatched silkworms were nothing more than small green worms that could be seen on flowers and trees, and they were very ugly; the only difference was that they had no patterns on their bodies, but were covered in gray and white. They were probably seven or eight tenths of an inch long, and a small bamboo plate was crowded with about one or two hundred of them; they were squirming, and I almost mistook them for a plate of maggots.</p>
<p>Although I didn't think these silkworms were good-looking at all, and even thought they were very ugly, because I heard the Empress Dowager say that they grew very quickly, and I could almost watch them grow, my curiosity was aroused (270)</p>

<h3 id="e188">Next Year's World Games: The Olympic Village is Declared Established; the Village Has Dormitories and Training Grounds for 3,000 Athletes; All Kinds of Equipment Will Be Completed by May 1st of Next Year <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin Special Dispatch) The large-scale Olympic Village currently is the one scheduled for Los Angeles, North America, in 1932. Germany must fulfill its obligations and treat the competitors from all countries in the world equally for the 1936 World Games (Olympic Games) to fulfill its responsibility of completing the World Games. The German National Defense Army is also prepared to bear the auxiliary capacity of this responsibility to build the Olympic Village and maintain its various administrations.</p>
<p>We imagine that the National Defense Army's great interest in the Games will ensure that all preparations are properly made so that all foreign guests arriving in Germany can have a model residence here that satisfies their desires.</p>
<p>The new Olympic Village is fourteen kilometers away from the Republican Sports Field. The undulating forest here is a landmark of Brandenburg with excellent scenery. As for this Games, it is expected that there will be 3,000 participants. The village has dormitories and training grounds. The women's sector will be separately arranged by the Olympic Committee at the Republican Sports Field. There has been an enthusiastic response from all over the world for those now requesting accommodation in the Olympic Village. The German Olympic Committee is handling the construction of the Olympic Village based on the experience gained in North America. The German Committee certainly cannot but consider the situation in Germany, estimate the large number of participants this time, and determine the location of the Olympic Village and manage its climate.</p>
<p>All the foundation, roads, and various development matters in the village can be fully completed in 1935. By 1935, various tall buildings should also be completed on schedule. The installation of all kinds of equipment can be completed by May 1, 1936. The entrance to the Olympic Village has a reception room, in front of which there is a large open space leading directly to Berlin Hamburg Street. The arrangements in the reception room are able to meet the needs of all guests and committee members. There are reception rooms, offices for the leaders of various delegations, telephones, the Republican Auditorium, storage of money, transportation offices, banks, post offices, and shops, etc. In addition, there are restaurants prepared for the guests of each competitor. However, guests who want to visit the competitors in the village—as stipulated by the North American Olympic Games—this is greatly beneficial to the competitors, so it is not allowed to enter the village directly. Near the entrance to the village is the dormitory area. There are many dormitories in the village, forming a large ring. However, the dormitories are all single-story stone buildings, each with ten to twelve rooms, all equipped with washing machines and shower irrigators. Each room is three meters wide and four meters long and has two beds. To the north of the village is a large business office with forty kitchens and dining halls, each with various equipment, such as kitchen administration, washing, food supply, fire protection, and parking facilities.</p>
<p>There are quite a few bathrooms in the village, and there is also a barber shop. The sports field itself is equipped with a public assembly hall according to the standards of the Olympic competition line, which also has a gymnasium for athletes to practice. Near the hall there is a large swimming pool, which embellishes the entire facility. In the center of the village is the judge's office, with a cluster of gleaming birch trees protruding. Preparations have now begun to make the accommodation in this village comfortable. This business has been entrusted to the German Shipping Company, which has a wealth of international experience. The cost of bathing, food, and car fare is six marks per person per day and night. In addition, to protect the safety of foreign guests, it is stipulated that each country can have German youth athletes as noble guards. These guards have a good understanding of the languages of various countries.</p>
<p>In order to integrate foreign guests of the 1936 Winter Games with the domestic people, people in the hotel industry and other people can freely come to take English and French lessons. To expand the plan, English or French lectures must also be promoted in primary and secondary schools.</p>

<h3 id="e201">This City to Launch Literacy Education Program <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Literacy Textbook Being Edited by the Education Bureau, Literacy Education Committee to Be Established Soon</p>
<p>Preparations for the large-scale literacy education movement in this city have been reported in newspapers many times. It is now known that the Municipal Education Bureau is actively preparing for this work and will organize a Literacy Education Committee to be specifically responsible for it. The organizational outline of the committee has also been drafted. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Active Preparations: There are many illiterate people in this city. Conducting literacy education is a very large undertaking. The budget is estimated at 200,000 yuan, which will be allocated by the municipal government. It is planned to hold six sessions of adult classes, each session lasting two months, and three sessions of children's classes, each session lasting four months, tentatively for one year. It is planned to start classes in June. The first step is to investigate the design and edit textbooks. The investigation work is the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau and has already begun. However, this work cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, the Education Bureau has now allocated the number of schools to be established in each district. There are a total of seventeen districts, including the whole province, Shanghai South, and Zhabei. Each district is divided into several small areas, and each small area will be assigned a number of schools as appropriate, totaling at least more than 300 schools in the city. However, in the special zone, it is planned to use social education groups and cultural institutions to promote this work.</p>
<p>Editing Textbooks: As for editing textbooks, the Education Bureau has organized a People's School Reader Committee to be responsible for editing textbooks for both adults and children. After several discussions, they are nearing completion. It is named the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Literacy Textbook. The content temporarily completes sixteen lessons of the citizen part, twelve lessons of the nature part, twelve lessons of the social part, and eight lessons of the health part, with a vocabulary of about 618 characters. The initial draft personnel for each part have also been decided. The first eight lessons will be edited by Li Wanyu, the citizen lessons will be edited by Xie Engao, the nature lessons will be edited by Zhang Yongchun, the social lessons will be edited by Chen Songshu, the health lessons will be edited by Hu Changcai, and the review lessons will be edited by Zhang Zhu. It has been decided that the initial draft will be submitted on the 20th of this month. Regarding the drawing of illustrations, Shi Chongpeng, Ji Xiaobo, Zhang Meisun, and Shi Lianhuang and others will discuss and set the date for drawing illustrations from April 1st to 15th.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 18th) The Third Joint Conference on Gengkuan Funds resolved to jointly launch new educational undertakings, of which 800,000 yuan will be used to promote compulsory education. At the same time, the National Government should allocate a considerable amount from the central funding for the next year as a subsidy for compulsory education. Recently, the Ministry of Education drafted an outline of measures to subsidize remote and impoverished provinces in implementing compulsory education, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the 448th meeting of the Central Political Conference for approval, and handed over to the Budget Review Committee. The Ministry of Education sent a letter recording the main points of the outline of the measures, requesting the four Gengkuan Fund agencies of China-US, China-UK, China-Belgium, and China-France to take note. The main points are as follows: 1. The provinces to be subsidized are temporarily limited to Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Ningxia, Qinghai, Chahar, Suiyuan, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Xikang. 2. The subsidy amount is 75,000 yuan from the national treasury each year, totaling 750,000 yuan. Its designated uses are: 1. Adding compulsory primary schools, 2. Adding short-term primary schools, 3. Strengthening existing primary schools, 4. Adding or expanding rural normal schools, 5. Subsidizing the promotion of schools. The two departments are planning to establish compulsory education experimental zones.</p>

<p>200,000 yuan per month</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) Due to the abolition of extortionate levies, Henan Province's education funds have been reduced by more than one million yuan annually. Education groups have sent representatives to Beijing to request subsidies.

<h3 id="e204">National Beiyang Institute of Technology to Reduce Tuition for New Students <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The National Beiyang Institute of Technology recently recognized that the rural economy is depressed and children from farming families are reluctant to advance their studies. Reducing various fees is necessary to seek relief. Following the 39th Institute Affairs Conference, it was decided that from the admission of new students in the 24th year of the Republic, tuition fees will be 10 yuan per semester, a reduction of 5 yuan from the previous amount. The originally stipulated accommodation fee of 6 yuan per semester and the one-time library fee of 15 yuan paid upon entering the school have been completely abolished. The sports fee of 1 yuan per semester and the compensation fee (i.e., security deposit) of 10 yuan remain the same. In addition, the application fee has been reduced from 3 yuan to 1 yuan. These measures have been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and filing. It is noted that the institute has always been known for its simplicity. Students focus on academics and have no frivolous or romantic habits, so personal expenses are very low. After this reduction, each person only needs 200 yuan per year, which can be said to be the lowest cost among all national universities.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Accepting Criticism <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Mushanokōji Saneatsu once wrote a short article called "All Works of Art," strongly urging writers to steadfastly follow their own path, all the way to a place of conviction, regardless of all the trials and tribulations. His words also carried criticism, saying:</p>
<p>The wishful thinking demands of critics should be ignored. They are not genuinely hoping for the author to improve. They are also human and cannot fundamentally understand other people's works...</p>
<p>This kind of opinion is very fashionable in the current Chinese literary and art circles, and it indeed has some influence. Since last year, whether they are writers or not, everyone has been criticizing criticism, and the only method of resistance, it is said, is precisely to "ignore it."</p>
<p>What is being criticized is "ignored," but there are usually a few words to say to those who are   　　. Perhaps saying, "This is a Taiwanese!" or "This belongs to such-and-such school!" and the more thorough response is, "Hey! You're pointing at your own nose."</p>
<p>A critic wants to criticize others, but unexpectedly points at his own nose in the mirror. Although this seems like a joke, the audience's reason will never be buried in their own laughter, because they can still know that this nose is indeed very black.</p>
<p>People with a firm path to walk can go ahead and walk their firm path. Although there is no perfect criticism now, there are also no absolutely absurd critics. The road is always firm. Critics, from the standpoint of bystanders, only point out the thorns and forks on that road. They will never tell you to turn back.</p>
<p>But now it is said that even the truth is crying in pain, because critics have condemned everything.</p>
<p>In practice, there are also distinctions in condemnation. Cursing that begins with "Damn it!" is certainly unacceptable, but a painful rebuke that can seize on flaws and enumerate them in detail can still be accepted.</p>
<p>Precisely because critics "are also human," we believe that they are able to "understand other people's works."</p>
<h3 id="e213">Mason Chen Qiu <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>"San Huai! -- This is the twelfth time I've encountered it, that beast! It was jumping and hopping there, and grinning at me..." Mason Chen Qiu lay on a bed composed of ambiguous gray and blue, pinching his thick throat with his hand, making a few dry monkey-like laughs. The air was trapped inside his lungs, as if being squeezed out of his ears, nose, and even eyes, causing his face to become completely flushed.</p>
<p>With whirlwind-like force, he threw back the quilt. All the lean bones in his body, protruding outside his tattered undershirt, barely supported his overly heavy head, which seemed on the verge of falling apart every second. He hopped around on the dirt floor, trying to shake off the cold air that immediately attacked his whole body like a wasp's stinger, continuing to exaggerate to his woman - who was squatting in the pine wood smoke in front of the small stove - and mentioning their daughter A Xi's name.</p>
<p>"That beast is getting closer and closer to me. Grab it and don't let go, dig its throat with your middle finger, and it will turn into a bag of silver - all the wise old folks know this! Tell A Xi to guess which character to buy, will she dare to buy another character? Of course not! She can only buy San Huai, and know that her old man still has this little bit of luck. Old hag, why are you so quiet? I had such a vivid dream last night..."</p>
<p>The woman, who was about fifty years old, emerged from the thick smoke like drifting clouds, mechanically answering him:</p>
<p>"A Xi went to buy vegetables, come wash your face. You often have dreams, A Qiu."</p>
<p>Then Chen Qiu grumbled and cursed his woman, recalling all her stupidity, hateful mistakes, and the bad luck she brought, and then began to search for cash in every possible place.</p>
<p>"Gambling on character tickets isn't anything great! Only you, this heartless old hag..."</p>
<p>At night, on top of the five or six-zhang-high banyan trees that could not be cut down, the north wind swirled around like sea waves, brushed against, and fought with the boundless green leaves, constantly whistling them down, and then trampling them with its icy hooves. In Chen Qiu's home, sharp, womanly shouts would pierce the grand sound waves and reach the ears of the surrounding neighbors.</p>
<p>So they began to speculate on the mason's anger.</p>
<p>"Didn't something open in the morning market today, wasn't it a monkey?"</p>
<p>"No, a carp."</p>
<p>To buy character tickets, he often argued with his daughter A Xi, a twenty-one or two-year-old girl with a large forehead, dull and dim eyes hidden beneath, who seemed even more stupid and stubborn than her mother when she spoke. She didn't believe in her father's dreams, and all the hints that all character ticket gamblers gratefully accepted, and didn't even want to talk about them at all. She just casually bought a character with all her money, and then forgot about it, as if she never had any hope for what she did.</p>
<p>They lived in a small wooden house made of old wooden boards and zinc iron near the foundation of the new Western-style houses that were being built on a large scale in the Youtong Yamen, close to several vegetable patches planted with lettuce and green onions. In the morning, before Chen Qiu started work, his threatening voice would burst out from inside:</p>
<p>"San Huai! There's no other character... you dare, if I lose, I'll break your head, you spendthrift! I dreamed of being chased by ghosts again last night - what is this if it isn't a dream omen, why would I have such a dream!"</p>
<p>But his daughter still answered him calmly and with some annoyance:</p>
<p>"Everyone has their own thoughts, anyway I don't believe you."</p>
<p>"Then, who do you believe?"</p>
<p>During the coldest days of the whole winter, Mason Chen Qiu's protruding, broad and rough forehead, eyes, nose, and mouth became more swollen and red. He walked with indignant steps, leaning his body forward, his head in a posture of wanting to examine something in detail. On the road and at the workplace, his loud voice spoke without any hesitation about things that everyone already knew... A people who live a long and tasteless life, engaged in monotonous, worthless work, cannot help but stir up some quarrels or vulgar debates to fill the emptiness of the soul, or make extremely meaningless moves to pay the price for sending away loneliness.</p>
<p>One sunny afternoon, Mason Chen Qiu rolled off the roof of a bungalow and fell to the ground. He suddenly ended his life like this. His fellow workers all heard him shouting loudly when he was swept up by this rapid roll:</p>
<p>"Grab it... grab... dig its throat - middle finger!" Such, or similar sounds. No one could point out what was meant by it.</p>
<p>An old water carrier, like a "poop knot" sparrow squeezed into the crowd, speculated without thinking, saying:</p>
<p>"He's probably drunk, right? But it's too late to vomit now."</p>
<p>The sun shone brightly on the completely still corpse, it lay on its side, its two feet spread out diagonally, all its fingers - on the left and right of its torso - were fastened in the loose soil, as if the deceased had tried to forcefully pull up the ground, and thus fell down himself. The blood flowing from the too large head was evaporated by the sun into a red mist, bright, beautiful, and with a moist and warm fishy smell. There were no traces of horror here, nor false weeping, everything was solemn and serious... The sun spread a golden brocade quilt over it, and the clouds added a sparse black veil. Life was still happy and great.</p>

<p>The Lu River is quiet.</p>
<p>It is exactly fourteen or fifteen, the night sky of Heilongjiang is clear and bright. No dogs barking, no roosters crowing. The silver moon, hangs high in the distant place, quietly, people have already fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Due to a special event, our four brothers, in such a deep night, hid in a farmer's house. Unable to resist the attack of the spring cold, we took some dry firewood, and we lit a fire.</p>
<p>Silently, we warmed the fire, everyone was silent. Only using our four pairs of sensitive ears to listen, whether there was anyone knocking on the door, footsteps, or gunshots outside. Because everyone's mind was calculating: deliberating.</p>
<p>Sincere old folks informed us that the enemy's forces in Ang'angxi are now very weak, an hour ago, we already had two hundred and fifty brothers departing there. Ang'angxi is not far from this river bank, as far as we know, it is only two and a half hours away. If we can see the firelight before dawn, then it can be predicted that our brothers have won.</p>
<p>If there is no news back after three hours, we will send a large group of people again. We gently stroked the fire, so that its light would not be too large, while holding our breath and listening to the sounds outside.</p>
<p>The universe is quiet, there is absolutely no sound worth causing our suspicion. We four brothers, are only imagining the unfolding of this event in each other's minds.</p>
<p>"Thump"! It seems like something fell from the wall behind.</p>
<p>"The messenger shouldn't be back yet, it's not time, I'm afraid there are scouts"!</p>
<p>One of the brothers said this.</p>
<p>So, after instructing a sentence: loading bullets into the chamber, we took the guns and two of us went out. We searched around Tianjia Village for a week; the black corners of the houses, the side of the big trees, we didn't find anything. Turning back, we were still warming the fire.</p>
<p>Having stayed in the house for less than half an hour, there was a sound outside again, this time it was a bit louder than before. We secretly slipped out, and saw a figure swaying there outside the village, we hadn't gone far, when that guy spotted us, he ran for his life, and we chased after him in the same way.</p>
<p>"Brother, don't shoot, let's catch him alive"! I shouted while running.</p>
<p>Quickly, that guy was cut down with a bayonet by this brave brother, he didn't even shout once. It happened to cut off his throat, he ran out of breath!</p>
<p>When we returned, passing by the embankment of the Lu River, the water was still flowing quietly. But, we saw the firelight in the distance, our hearts were laughing.</p>
<p>In the faint dawn, we recognized that the person we had stabbed to death was a beggar.</p>
<p>"It shouldn't be! Beggars have also helped us"!</p>
<p>The face of the brother who had stabbed him to death immediately showed an awkward sadness.</p>

<p>— Translated by Tokunaga Sunao, translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>That day, for the sake of celebration, the school was closed, and there were no classes, only the principal said a few words about the fall of Fengtian City, and the great victory of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>In the village temple, wine for worshiping the gods was laid out. The aunt was just as happy as if the uncle was coming back from the battlefield tomorrow.</p>
<p>Russian prisoners were sent over. It was said that the red-bearded Russian devils captured by the Thirteenth Regiment were all to be held in a makeshift shed in the playground, so we ran to watch with the people of the village.</p>
<p>The Russian devils were all big guys. Just as I had imagined, their beards were all red, and their eyes were like glass, seeming very dull. All were wearing hat-like things. Moreover, the prisoners saw the faces of us children and all murmured, smiling and walking past.</p>
<p>"The Russian devils are laughing!"</p>
<p>We felt that the Russian devils were not promising. The guns and swords had all been confiscated, and they were still smiling like this. I couldn't help but feel it was incredible.</p>
<p>When we went home from school, we took a detour every day to see the prisoners.</p>
<p>"Cowardly red beards!"</p>
<p>"Where did your swords go?"</p>
<p>We cursed at the Russian devils who were tightly imprisoned from outside the bamboo fence, or threw stones in, for about an hour.</p>
<p>But, the Russian devils never got angry. Their long red hair was all messed up, murmuring something, and smiling at us. The Japanese guard soldiers who were walking back and forth in front of the fence of the small house, their height, could only reach their chests.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Living Characters and Dead Characters (3) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>I think that teaching people to read and write should never start from oneself, and speak from one's own position. Mr. Ji Ru Cao thinks that writing the wrong character doesn't matter. In Mr. Cao's pen, there are ancient books that can be used as legal guests, knowing how to distinguish, is to distinguish into the pile of old papers, how to distinguish, is to distinguish into the homes of the ancients. It's a pity that young people will not understand the meaning, so the characters that cannot be used universally are also used, the strokes that cannot be less are less, and the strokes that cannot be more are more. As a result, people can't guess the wonderful meaning of the sentence. My two colleagues and I often hold student homework together, stunned, and guess randomly.</p>
<p>I remember that last year when Peking University recruited students, some applicants wrote "倡明", which of course was a mistake for 昌明. Some wrote "流學生", which of course was a mistake for 留. Professor Liu Bannong made an oil poem to mock it (see Analects Issue 26), which was of course inappropriate. Mr. Lu Xun's defense (see Zhun Feng Yue Tan Page 150) was also unnecessary. In short, characters such as "倡" and "流" are all mistakes and should be corrected.</p>
<p>As for the greatest reason that Mr. Cao insists on, thinking that the ancients could write other people, why can't today's young people write the wrong character? Regarding this point, I feel that the words of our colleague Mr. He Zhongying can represent me, and it is okay to copy a paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>He's Outline of Chinese Philology, pages 79 and 80, says:</p>
<p>"... The ancients used borrowing, which was also writing the wrong character, which was also not appropriate. However, it has been passed down from ancient times, and it has always been popular, and now there is no way to force people to correct it. Suppose that every character can be corrected, which is the "stem father's bug" said in the Book of Changes. Even if it is not possible, can many more wrong characters be added outside the wrong characters written by the ancients? The wrong characters written by the ancients are popular to this day, the same throughout the country, so they can still be understood. If people today add many wrong characters, and use the local pronunciation of each place to write, people in other provinces and other counties will not be able to understand them, and later the characters in the whole country will definitely be different from each other, isn't this a major obstacle?... "</p>
<p>Mr. He's words are not groundless, nor are they particularly fond of the ancients and dismissive of the present people. He really feels that to require the unification of characters, it is best to reduce the obstacles to circulation on the characters themselves. Writing the wrong character is the biggest obstacle to the unification of characters. Mr. He said that if many wrong characters are added, people in other provinces and other counties will not be able to understand them. I think that not only people in other provinces and other counties will not be able to understand them, I am afraid that each person will write each person's wrong character. As a result, one person has one way of writing, and two people cannot understand each other when communicating! Recently, I received a letter from a junior high school classmate. From beginning to end, it was four long sheets of paper. I don't know what he was talking about, because he used many wrong characters and mixed in some dialects. After guessing for a long time, it was still incomprehensible. I am really anxious for these poor young children!</p>
<p>My prejudice is that those who don't know the distinction and don't understand people, of course, should correct the writing of the wrong characters. Those who know the distinction and so-called understanders should especially prohibit the wrong characters, so as to confuse the youth's vision and hearing, and make the characters unable to unify. Those who don't understand, unintentionally writing the wrong character, can still be forgiven; as for those who are so-called understanders, if they intentionally write the wrong character to boast of their erudition, it is really unforgivable. It must be known that the ancients wrote the wrong character, sometimes due to oral transmission, it was really unavoidable. We who are born today don't need to learn it, and can't learn it. I don't know why Mr. Cao, who "advises people not to read ancient books" (Note 2), wants to bring out so many "dead characters" to replace "living characters"? (According to the examples cited by Mr. Cao, "The chrysanthemum will never need to bloom from now on" was originally a harmonic couplet, not to mention. As for the character 鞠 in "There are chrysanthemums with yellow flowers", it has already become a dead character).</p>
<p>(Note 1) Mr. Hu Pu'an has an article "Wrong Characters Should Not Be Written", published in the 15th issue of Min Bao. (Note 2) Mr. Cao has an article "Advise People Not to Read Ancient Books", published in Reading Life. (End)</p>

When Sassoon slightly filled the shilling, the banks had a selling appetite, and the foreign exchange market became even looser. The market presented a supply exceeding demand, and fell.

The Central Government suddenly filled the shilling, and it became weak again. After entering, the fluctuation was extremely small.

At this time, because Sassoon was still digging for US dollars, it was able to support it, and the rise and fall were extremely narrow. Later, when the Indian silver reported long for the second time, Fuduo couldn't support it, and Sassoon was willing to fill the shilling, and it fell slightly again. However, the transaction was always limited, and the market situation was still idle. The result was also no special change. The swap was urgently posted by the shorts, and there were not many buyers, and the posted price fell to about one and a half yuan. The situation of the day will be recorded later.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Foreign Exchange Trends Differ Between England and America <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's major rate recently narrowed to 1875, further dropping to 125. New York silver prices fell by 25. Forward silver prices in Montreal also narrowed by varying degrees, from 2.8 to 4 percent. London raw gold fell by 7.5 pence. The British pound against the U.S. dollar rose by half a point, while the U.S. dollar against the British pound rose by one point. The British pound against the French franc rose by 12 points, while the U.S. dollar against the French franc narrowed by 25. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of the British pound at one shilling, seven pence, and 3125, and the U.S. dollar at 34.625 yuan. Compared to the closing price last Saturday, both the British and U.S. currencies tightened by 0.0625. The Central Bank's listed exchange rate showed the British pound unchanged, while the U.S. dollar rose by 125. Customs gold units narrowed by 8 percent. Chinese merchants' sentiment weakened. After opening, prices were flat and weak. It was anticipated that the HSBC listing would show the British pound unchanged, while the U.S. dollar would narrow by 0.0625. During this process, there were many transactions, and banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, which helped to maintain the rates. However, when Sassoon slightly offered more currency, banks also started to supply, and the process became firmer. But at noon, prices still hovered around the same levels, and banks only engaged in some reciprocal transactions. The afternoon market initially seemed firm due to Jardine Matheson's purchases, but unexpectedly, the Central Bank suddenly offered shillings, and the process stabilized again. Although Sassoon's purchases of U.S. dollars improved sentiment, the continuous rise in the price of silver from the mint, rising a total of 58 annas, ultimately made it difficult to rally, and transactions were also few. Ultimately, Sassoon wanted to offer shillings but was unsuccessful. At the close, the near-term selling price of the British pound was one shilling and seven pence and 375, and the U.S. dollar was 38.75 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound was unchanged, while the U.S. dollar strengthened by 0.0625. Chinese merchants' appetite was calm. There were no significant sales.

<h3 id="e221">Securities: Supply Exceeds Demand, Bond Market Declines Slightly Across the Board <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 18th, the public bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was sluggish and lacking in spirit, failing to rally. The situation on the trading floor gradually showed signs of struggling. Many were covering shorts at low prices. Although the number of shares bought on the 4th was not large, the trend had already shifted. The sluggish market price was attributed by some to the impact of Germany's forced conscription and military discipline, while others said it was related to the slim hope of securing a large loan. However, these are superficial explanations, seemingly correct but not actually so. As the settlement period approached, many bulls were rolling over their positions, while some bears were also covering at low prices. Ultimately, supply exceeded demand. Whether the future would be characterized by a squeeze on the bulls or the bears was not yet apparent. Yesterday's trading can be described as a continuous decline. Although the decline in each trade was slight, there was no rebound from morning to dusk. Although there were one or two instances where certain bonds briefly strengthened due to a slight surge in buying interest, they soon fell again under high pressure. Sellers were primarily from the 21st, 43rd, and Northern groups, while buyers were primarily from the 4th, 32nd, 48th, and 53rd groups. If the 4th continues to cover shorts, the trend may improve. The market price ultimately fell by 0.12 to 0.6 yuan. The total number of shares traded was 12,406,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e222">Yarn and Cotton: More Sellers in Distant Months for Yarn <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>After an initial decline, the yarn market rebounded, but the overall trend remained flat. However, sales of spot yarn coming through continued to be maintained. As the season is still in its peak month, bulls feel increasingly calm and have no intention of letting go. However, the global cotton industry situation appears pessimistic.</p>
<p>Gold Rooster Brand Falls by 4-5 Jiao</p>
<p>The market for raw cotton opened lower across all months due to the strong decline in U.S. cotton prices, which dampened sentiment. However, bull companies continued to hold firm. As the market approached distant months, sellers gathered, and prices loosened further. As a result, near-month prices fell by 0.4 yuan, while distant-month prices fell by 0.6-0.8 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that there were still over 1,600 bales of spot cotton for sale. Some who had made profits in the market covered their positions, boosting market sentiment. However, there was very little interest from new buyers as the calculated price of foreign yarn was gradually becoming cheaper. Sales included 700 bales by Dafeng, 600 bales by Yiyu, 500 bales by Hexing, 500 bales by Shenji, 2,150 bales by Renfeng, 1,750 bales by Yichang, 500 bales by Run Kang, 650 bales by Dachang, 850 bales by Shengyuan, and 750 bales by Yuanda. Purchases included 1,000 bales by Jinchang, 950 bales by Yuanyi, 1,500 bales by Changfeng, 700 bales by Hengchang, 1,000 bales by Chong'an, 1,250 bales by Yida, and 400 bales by Yongchang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Inventory</p>
<p>-----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------</p>
<p>March Term | 181.1 | 180.7 | 181.0 | Down 0.40 | 28,250</p>

<p>Total |  |  |  |  | 222,400</p>
<p>Actual Sales Decrease Further</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn were slightly better, but less than before. According to statistics, all dealers bought a total of 1,575 bales throughout the day. The market was flat. The amount purchased by each dealer is as follows:</p>
<p>Swatow 90, Inland 25, Jiangxi 320, Guangdong 170</p>
<p>Sichuan 100, Changsha 190, Anqing 5, Amoy 5</p>
<p>Ningbo 30, Wuhu 10, Colleagues 10, Yunnan 40</p>
<p>Henan 310, Luzhou 25, Tianjin 5</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Yu Kang Yarn Factory in Shanghai, the sale of 15 pieces of 17-count Jiulong yarn to the Tianjin dealers for 178 yuan listed in the market price column on the 17th did not occur. The current market price is 185 yuan. It is believed that there was a rumor error. Please correct it.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Bulls Add to Near-Term Cotton Positions <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market saw near-term (March and April) prices rise exclusively, as buyers prepared to squeeze the shorts during these two months, holding firm and purchasing large quantities of April cotton. The reason given was that the quality of April cotton was two yuan higher than that of May cotton. Therefore, bulls held firm. However, the global cotton market was showing new lows, and the voices of a squeeze were also very strong.</p>
<p>Distant Months Fall as Sellers Dominate</p>
<p>The market for raw cotton opened lower across all months due to the continued decline in U.S. cotton prices. The price of old cotton had broken through the 1 jiao 1 fen level, and gold prices were also weak, dampening sentiment. However, April remained strong as bulls added to their positions, rising by 1 jiao 5 fen to 1 jiao. There were more sellers in the distant months, and the market became increasingly depressed, falling by 2 jiao 5 fen. In the afternoon, it was reported that foreign cotton news was still not good, and the situation for distant months was extremely poor. As a result, near-month prices rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao, while distant-month prices fell by 1 jiao. Sales included 1,600 dan by Yuanda, 1,300 dan by Tongji, 4,700 dan by Dafu, 5,300 dan by Yuanda, 2,700 dan by Hexing, 5,400 dan by Gengfeng, 6,700 dan by Yuanyi, 2,300 dan by Changfeng, and 3,100 dan by Yikang. Purchases included 11,900 dan by Jifeng, 1,900 dan by Jinchang, 1,900 dan by Yichang, 2,100 dan by Run Kang, 1,900 dan by Dachang, 1,600 dan by Chong'an, 5,500 dan by Yuanxingchang, 3,600 dan by Changhe, 1,600 dan by Deji, and 1,900 dan by Gengfeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory</p>
<p>-----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------|----------</p>
<p>March Term | 34.3 | 33.95 | 34.35 | Up 0.20 | 49,600</p>

<p>Total |  |  |  |  | 702,300</p>
<p>Domestic Cotton Sales Become Increasingly Limited</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is unusually quiet. As foreign cotton prices continue to fall sharply and new lows are found, the cost of purchasing foreign cotton is becoming increasingly cheaper. Factories are naturally purchasing foreign cotton, and sales of domestic cotton are very limited. Sources included 1,100 bales of Yao cotton:</p>
<p>Pingguo Er 33.25, Fu'an Factory purchase 300 pieces delivered to Chongming</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 47.50, Shenxin Factory purchase 133 pieces spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton 47.5, Shenxin Factory purchase 100 pieces spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 42.25, Yong'an Factory purchase 200 pieces spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Cotton 45.00, Yufeng Factory purchase 82 pieces spot delivery to factory</p>

<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The cotton yarn market in this city is still good, and customer sales are still smooth, but the atmosphere is trending towards flatness, and market prices have not fluctuated much. The Gu dealers bought 5 bales of 17-count Bama yarn for 182 yuan. The Baigou dealers bought 13 bales of 10-count Bama yarn for 144.5 yuan, and 5 bales of 10-count Sanguang yarn for 156.5 yuan, and another 5 bales for 156 yuan. The prices above include taxes. The Gu dealers bought 14 bales of (Qingdao yarn) 30-count Five-Star yarn for 236 yuan.</p>

<p>Difficult to Arrange Loading for Prescheduled Orders; Wheat Market Quiet and Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of all months showed a trend of being flat initially and then rising. As for the quoted prices of foreign wheat, Chicago was down by 0.125 to 0.1625 yuan, and Canada was down by more than 0.1 yuan. After the opening, the market sentiment was initially flat and weak due to the quoted prices of foreign wheat. However, by the second round of trading, the market sentiment for all months gradually improved. As spot flour was still tight this month, flour shipments required advance orders, a situation rarely seen in recent times. The strong sentiment was not without reason. For distant months, the number of sellers was small while the number of buyers was quite robust, which also led to a rebound. When the market opened in the afternoon, the number of sellers for this month was still small, and customers made slight purchases, which made the market even more stable and tight. Trading in distant months was not extensive, but slight movements from customers also led to a sustained rebound. Observing this trend, there may be a need to increase supply this month. As a result, this month rose by 0.02 yuan, April rose by 0.015 yuan, May rose by 0.0175 yuan, June rose by 0.01 yuan, July rose by 0.0125 yuan, and August rose by 0.015 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, all months showed a quiet and flat trend. Although the quoted prices of foreign wheat were down by 0.08 to 0.1 yuan, the internal and external buyers in the market were truly few because old inventory was falling in value and new inventory still had to be awaited. Although foreign wheat continued to arrive, most of it was ordered by factories, and the actual impact was relatively small. As a result, trading in all months was dull. As a result, only this month was down by 0.02 yuan, and there was no comparison for the others. The spot wheat market was again flat and weak, with 2,000 packages of Haizhou wheat at 3.62 yuan and Jiangbei wheat at 3.60 yuan, which were handled by Xinda.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: | 15th | 16th | Change</p>
<p>-------------|------|------|-------</p>
<p>May | 92.75 | 92.2 | Down 0.50</p>
<p>July | 89.375 | 89.25 | Down 0.25</p>
<p>September | 89.625 | 89.125 | Down 0.50</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat: | 15th | 16th | Change</p>
<p>---------------|------|------|-------</p>

<h3 id="e226">Rice Has Reached the 10 Jiao Threshold <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Rice Sources Uninterrupted, Sales Even More Stagnant</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 20 customer groups, with nearly 4,000 shi of goods. Sales were scarce due to rain. Both this street and customer routes were sluggish. Only the Tianjin and Yantai groups handled 400-500 packages. The overall market color turned tired, seeming stagnant and unchanging. The reason for this is that the price of high-quality rice on the market has reached the 10 yuan threshold, and there is a possibility of change. People are inevitably waiting and watching. The price of each thick japonica and thin indica rice was reduced by a few jiao, while the price of Du Jian and Yinyuan and other varieties fell by about 1 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few boats from the He Xia groups. The outflow of various types of rice in the market was flat. The price of high-quality white japonica rice was down by a few fen, while the price of medium and secondary quality rice was stable. The price of high-quality lamb tip rice was tight due to lack of supply. The price of other types of rice did not fluctuate much. However, there was little white yuan rice arriving, and the river inventory was scarce, so the price was raised by 2 jiao.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Was even more spiritless because sources continued uninterrupted, but sales were once again flat. The Hankou and Jiujiang groups along the Yangtze River route completely stopped. There were also few firms packing their own rice. Arrivals were high, and sales were low, so the market gradually declined. Inland groups were also not as eager as before. There was limited trading on the market, with only 5,000 packages traded in the entire city, mainly Saigon No. 13 and Xiao Jiao. Saigon March futures fell to 4.43 yuan, down nearly 2 jiao from the beginning of last week. It is estimated that 1____ of returned cargo was traded. Customer groups had fewer arrivals and inventory, so the market could have stabilized. However, affected by foreign rice, the market was also spiritless. Yesterday, the spot price of foreign rice and Ke Xian were both down by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan compared to the end of last week.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was more active than it had been last week. This was because, after the price of soybean cake depreciated, the Shantou and Guangdong groups were still able to continue their buying sprees. The total number of futures and spot cakes traded on the market yesterday was 76,000-77,000 pieces, and market prices also changed (see market price for details). As a result, factory soybean sales became active. It is estimated that 6,000 packages of Guide soybeans were traded at a price of 3.6 yuan, 5-6 vehicles of Yingzhou soybeans were traded at a price of 3.45-3.4 yuan, 1 vehicle of Bengbu soybeans was traded at a price of 3.35 yuan, and 600 packages of Hankou Za soybeans were traded at a price of 3.38-3.25 yuan. The market was still characterized by high prices for high-quality soybeans and flat or tired prices for secondary soybeans.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was sluggish and weak due to poor sales. The guild's listed price for 24 coarse sand white was 16.8 yuan, and the price for re-exported goods was 4.75 yuan. The listed price for re-exported No. 8 Dutch red was 4.4 yuan. There were no transactions. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company auctioned off a batch of Guangdong coarse white. Of the original amount of 3,000 packages, only 940 packages were sold at a price of 16.7 yuan, down 0.15 yuan from before. The listed price for secondary goods was 16.5 yuan, with the same degree of decline, and 200 packages were sold. 850 packages of re-exported Dutch coarse white were sold for 4.75 yuan. The price of cotton white from this factory did not fluctuate much. No. 1 was still 16.2 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were priced according to the discount rate.</p>

<p>Raw sun-dried longans from Tong'an had previously increased by 2 yuan due to limited arrivals. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived from Xiamen, and a new batch arrived, totaling 41 pieces, which was more than before.

<p>The price of white tung oil has been rising almost every day for the past week. When the city of Hankou was selling foreign oil for 37 yuan per dan the previous week, the market atmosphere was already very tense. Everyone believed that it had to reach the 40 yuan mark. When Hankou actually achieved this goal last week, the atmosphere still did not ease. Therefore, reporters predicted that there would be another rise of 1-2 yuan. The Japanese newspaper reported that yesterday, Hankou had already sold foreign oil for 41.7 yuan, creating a peak. There was a soaring momentum. The soaring prices have caused panic in the market, and foreign firms may stop handling it. Otherwise, it will soar to the sky. The price was 10.7 yuan. The listed price for secondary goods was 16.5 yuan, with the same degree of decline, and 200 packages were sold. 850 packages of re-exported Dutch coarse white were sold for 4.75 yuan. The price of cotton white from this factory did not fluctuate much. No. 1 was still 16.2 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were priced according to the discount rate.</p>

<p>—Japanese Goods Replacing Domestic Goods—</p>
<p>Since last year, imports of plain, solid-colored gray serge from England, America, France, and Germany have decreased significantly. The biggest reason for this is the impact of the dumping of cheap Japanese goods, which has caused traders to lose money. As a result, the majority have switched to selling Japanese goods, followed by domestic goods. Patriotic compatriots have added a large number of uniforms, and 80-90% of them use domestic goods. The 9/18 solid color ____ is sold in wholesale for 2.8 yuan per yard, and in retail for 0.77-0.78 yuan per foot. No. 1 Japanese goods sell for 2.9 yuan, and No. 2 sells for 2.675 yuan.</p>

The number of transactions has been as high as 500-600 boxes. Among them, printing and can factories have been particularly eager to purchase. Standard market prices have increased by 1-2 jiao per box. It is estimated that single-coated sells for 15.5 yuan and double-coated sells for 31.5 yuan. As the foreign exchange market tightens, there is still hope for further improvement in market prices.</p>

The difference between the highest and lowest prices on the market is estimated to be 0.5-0.6 yuan. The highest price is said to be 14.3-14.4 yuan, while the lowest price is estimated to be only 13.7-13.8 yuan. Due to the unfavorable environment, there are only sporadic transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Remedial Measures After the Abolition of the Concubine System <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Qiuyun</p>
<p>At the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting the other day, there was a major dispute when deliberating Article 9 of the Draft Enforcement Law of the Criminal Code. The article stated, "The provisions of Article 239 of the Criminal Code shall not apply to those who, before the implementation of the Criminal Code, have a cohabiting relationship with someone other than their spouse for the purpose of permanent cohabitation." Those who advocated for this article said it was a way to remedy the situation of those who had taken concubines before the new Criminal Code came into effect, so that the old concubines would not be left without support. Those who advocated for deleting the article said that it clearly protected concubinage, and since the Civil Code already provided relief, adding this article was superfluous.</p>
<p>Both sides seemed to have their reasons, but I agree with the latter. The principle that laws should not be retroactive is a common practice in law enforcement. Therefore, a law's effect must begin after its promulgation. Thus, even though the new Criminal Code has Article 239, it can only take effect after the new Criminal Code is promulgated. Old accounts before the new Criminal Code is promulgated are originally all not counted, which needn't be said. However, after the chairman put the case to a vote, only three people supported the deletion. Presumably, people were worried about women secretly seducing men, or that wives would jointly sue concubines, to avoid a commotion.</p>
<p>What I want to discuss is not this, but something else. Although the concubine system has been abolished, in reality it has not been abolished in many places. If we are trying to remedy the situation of those who took concubines before the new Criminal Code came into effect, it could open the door for people to take concubines in the future. For example, for concubines taken after the promulgation of the new Criminal Code, the date on the contract of sale could be backdated. How could the authorities investigate each case? Furthermore, the number of divorce cases is increasing daily. Although this is not entirely due to the abolition of the concubine system, the abolition of the concubine system is somewhat related to divorce cases. In the past, if a married man found someone else he liked, he would either take her as a minor concubine or a major concubine (the so-called "two big heads"). Now that the system of one husband and one wife is advocated, he must divorce his first wife before he can marry a second wife. Men can remarry after divorce without any problem, but it is difficult for women to remarry. Only women like Wei Wenxiu, who have high status and wealth, or like Ruan Lingyu, who have both beauty and talent, have a way out; otherwise, it is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the decree abolishing concubinage was promulgated, it is fine for young men to be without a wife, but it is difficult for old men to be without a wife. The poor have no way to manage, and the rich find it difficult to choose a mate. Only those with superior status, such as Xiong Fenghuang, Zhang Hairuo, and Qi Xieyuan, can attract women with vanity to serve them. The only ones who suffer are a few old men with long beards. Otherwise, who would be willing to be the spouse of a withered old man? Furthermore, those who can afford to take a concubine must be well-fed and well-clothed, and women who are willing to be concubines must be forced by the whip of life and have no other choice. They are either daughters of poor families or maids from dilapidated houses. If they do not become concubines, the rich will not want to marry them, and the poor cannot afford to marry them. Poor women have one less way out.</p>
<p>The abolition of the concubine system is truly humanitarian, and although it is very good, it unfortunately causes many problems. This is something that the legislators did not anticipate. This is also something that should be noted and remedied after the abolition of the concubine system.</p>

<p>— Xiaohong</p>
<p>It's already late at night. That little table clock just struck two, but I'm very excited and not tired at all. I simply forgot that it's time to sleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's the power of alcohol? At dinner, I had a drink with some friends—just one drink—and then went to a friend's house to chat for a while. By the time I got home, it was past midnight, and I'm still very excited. I've inexplicably shed tears several times.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll laugh at me for being too weak. Why shed tears for no reason? Crying won't solve anything.</p>
<p>If you really say that, or think that way, then I want to tell you loudly: Crying is definitely not a sign of my weakness. Didn't I already say that it's for no reason? Because I don't feel sad at all. Although I know my mood isn't very good right now, it's definitely not sadness, definitely not sadness! Do you understand?</p>
<p>I have so much to tell you, but I don't know what to say first. Ah, my emotions are too agitated. What should I say to you first?</p>
<p>Yes, let me first tell you about my motive for coming to see you that day. I gave you a letter, and you didn't reply for several days (usually you reply so quickly, right?). So I recalled the contents of my letter. I thought, perhaps I offended you, misunderstood my meaning, and thought I looked down on you. But isn't it true, my friend? In our times of distress, in our times of melancholy, we should rationally encourage each other. Wouldn't saying such melancholic and sentimental words only make us more melancholic and sentimental?</p>
<p>However, I ultimately believed that such a thing should not cause a misunderstanding in our friendship. Therefore, I made a special trip to prepare to explain to you, or to exaggerate, to apologize to you.</p>
<p>But in the end, I didn't say it, because from your words, I knew that you were still the same as before and didn't misunderstand my meaning.</p>
<p>Lately, life has been like this. I play every day, and I also do things every day. Because life has created a stronger meaning for me. I train myself every day, and I whip myself every day, to prevent myself from falling into the swamp of decline. I try my best to find happiness, although I often can't find it and often return home with a belly full of melancholy and a belly full of sadness. But when I come home and see the work diary on my desk, my strong will raises its head again. I feel that the more ruthless society is to me, the more I should survive more strongly and harder. If someone touches a single hair on my body, I have to return a heavy punch. Moreover, in this society, those who have the same experience as you and me, or even worse than mine, are everywhere. For myself, and for those who share the same fate as me, how can I so easily become decadent and passive?</p>
<p>Friend, it seems that you are really becoming distant from me, as you said! But this will definitely not cause me to be pessimistic. Those who don't understand me are gradually becoming distant, which is inevitable. Just like how I treat them, because I can't understand them, we naturally walk further and further apart.</p>
<p>Of course, there are quite a few friends who can understand me, but what percentage is this so-called understanding? At most, they only understand some outlines of me, or even those outlines are a bit blurry.</p>
<p>Because of this, I can't help but feel desolate (especially in this environment where the lonely moon hangs high and all sounds are silent). So I picked up my pen to write you a letter, because I thought that you at least understand the outline of me clearly.</p>
<p>There have been many tragedies among my friends recently. Although I am an observer, these shadows often rise to my heart and cause me infinite nameless melancholy.</p>
<p>Every young person in today's society is too depressed.</p>
<p>It's already three thirty now. I think I should go to sleep quickly, because I still have things to do tomorrow morning. Although I'm still so excited and don't feel tired at all, I'm sure I'll have insomnia when I lie down in bed, but I have to sleep.</p>
<p>If possible, I would really like to have a chance to talk to you at length.</p>
<h3 id="e237">A Melancholy Woman <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Because I love some seascapes, I always have to walk through that charming soft mist every morning and go to the beach, sit on a flat piece of mica stone, watching the crimson sun slowly rise from the eastern horizon, rendering the sea completely blood-red; the morning mist covering the sea gradually shrinks.</p>
<p>I sit alone on the stone by the sea, flipping through a novel, listening to the surging sound of the waves, carefully chewing on my lonely mood, and recalling dreamlike past events. - For two years, whether in winter or summer, I have never missed a day, unless it rains, I would be wistfully stuck in the house.</p>
<p>Two years like a day, every day I come here to spend a lonely morning; many books have been turned over from my hands here one by one. Two months ago, a woman suddenly appeared on this beach, estimated to be about twenty years old, her face was as pale as a piece of white paper. However, judging from her dress, she was at least a aristocratic modern young woman. Every day she always carried a leather suitcase, dragging a heavy step, stumbling along the beach, sometimes sitting on a rock by the sea, silently, silently watching a stack of waves rolling to the beach, letting the sea breeze blow her hair fluttering, as if thinking about something?</p>
<p>Her beauty cannot be completely covered by her haggardness, but her beauty also cannot hide her melancholy; a kind of inner sadness is often revealed in her slight sighs. She does this every day, without glancing at me, as if she doesn't feel that there is another me on this beach.</p>
<p>Her time seems to be earlier than mine. When I arrive at the beach at six o'clock every day, she is already wandering or sitting silently there; she always goes back after eight o'clock. One day, driven by curiosity, I waited for her to leave, so I followed her, preparing to explore the secret; but after only two turns, she seemed to know that I was specially following her, and she turned around.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Terror <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>

<p>She threw me a contemptuous look, which couldn't help but make me turn around and flee, as if an explorer defeated by a beast had returned home, regretting why I was so reckless; perhaps she would suspect that I had bad intentions and dare not come to this beach again tomorrow. I hardly closed my eyes all night, immersing my thoughts in curiosity and suspicion, and exploring the truth.</p>
<p>- How mysterious is her behavior! But why is she so depressed?</p>
<p>- Should she have a man? No, maybe she is already a remnant flower abandoned by the roadside!</p>
<p>- Her family will never be one that cannot afford meals!</p>
<p>- Perhaps she is a pitiful person who has exhausted the tastes of the world!</p>
<p>- Yes, she must be a patient with lung disease!</p>
<p>These questions kept swirling in my mind, but I couldn't find a proper answer.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to that beach as usual, but she was still there before me: and still like usual, seemed to have forgotten yesterday's affairs. On the other hand, I was a little cramped, wanting to step forward to apologize to her, but I didn't dare to be presumptuous, for fear of backfiring and causing trouble, so I finally didn't have the courage. Even though I wanted to ask her about her life several times, or I could find a way to comfort her and persuade her, but in the end, I didn't.</p>
<p>Now it has been more than a week since she was last seen on this beach; but I still go there every day. The beach, the waves, the tidal flats, the eastern morning sun, and the misty soft fog... everything is still so great, so beautiful, even so quiet: but where did that melancholy person go!</p>
<h3 id="e239">Mother <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>My mother is already sixty years old this year! I left my lovely hometown when my mother was fifty-four years old, and now it has been a full six years since I last saw my elderly mother.</p>
<p>Six years of life have worn me down extraordinarily! It's as if I never had an innocent and lively childhood: I've become taciturn and rarely smile. When I see my closest friends, I only ask if they are doing well. The childish habits of shouting and jumping can no longer be found on me, although sometimes I really want to cheer up and play with a group of companions of similar age.</p>
<p>How long six years is! Living in the whirlpool of unemployment, I can feel it even more.</p>
<p>The year I left home, my mother already had gray hair: now, it's probably all white.</p>
<p>Letters from home always say that the countryside has suffered from floods, droughts, and wars. Whenever I receive such a pair of letters from home, my melancholic heart, which has been wounded by life and entangled by sorrow, is even more saddened by this desperate cry from home! On my existing scars, a deep line is added. Often, after a moment of stunned standing, I unconsciously fall on the bed and sob softly! The shadow of my mother flashes in my mind like lightning:</p>
<p>A round, anemic face, and when she speaks of something that she can't find a solution for, her eyebrows are locked in a line, her mouth is tightly closed, and her muscles twitch... This is the vague outline of my mother that I can remember.</p>
<p>I can now recall the embarrassment of my mother six years ago when she sent her pampered and sheltered young son to Shanghai thousands of miles away to find his brother. I know that my mother's heart was more painful than if a sharp knife had been inserted into it! Even more painful!</p>
<p>Since the year I left, from my mother's letters, I knew that the family was getting worse every year! In the second year, my mother didn't even have porridge to eat, so she was taken away by my second sister. Until now, she has been at my second sister's house for a full five years?</p>
<p>My second sister certainly doesn't have anything to say, because after all, she is her own mother! But my brother-in-law is different and often speaks badly of my mother behind her back. My mother's ears are not deaf, and soon these rumors invade her old ears?</p>
<p>With an unusually stubborn mind, (in ordinary times he always said that he would not rely on anyone to support him except his son!) and usually holding the principle of "not asking anyone for anything", how can my mother endure this kind of stimulation that she has never experienced in her life?</p>
<p>I seem to see a withered old woman, with her gray hair scattered, drowning in the sea with tears on her face, begging me for help with the most miserable cry of mankind - that is my mother - but I myself am a poor worm who can't swim, watching her pale head sink down, only a few strands of white hair rise and fall on the surface of the water before disappearing...</p>

<h3 id="e240">A Discussion on Several "Quickhand Characters" <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>After the "May Fourth" Movement, people actively promoted a more accessible vernacular Chinese to replace the profound classical Chinese for the convenience of application. Now, for the convenience of writing practice, there is also the promotion of "quickhand characters". It can be seen that the development of culture is entirely due to the evolution of the times and the needs of the masses, and it is not produced by chance.</p>
<p>The convenience of "quickhand characters" has already been mentioned by the editor, so I don't need to say more. However, I have a question about quickhand characters that I would like to raise and ask the gentlemen who advocate this type of writing to give me an explanation.</p>
<p>The vocabulary of quickhand characters has already been selected by the promotion association to consist of three hundred characters, and more will be published in the future. However, among these three hundred quickhand characters, there are a few characters that are not simple enough. For example, why not write the character "馬" (horse) as "马"? Why not write the character "縣" (county) as "县"? Why not write the character "疊" (stack) as "垒"? Also, why not write the character "癮" (addiction) as "流"? I think it seems much more convenient to change the four dots of the character "馬" to a "一" (one). It is easier for masses to understand "疊" as "垒," "縣" as "县", and "癮" as "疣," and they are also quite prevalent in the habits, so why not make it simple? Therefore, I would like to raise this for everyone's discussion. Perhaps my opinion is a bit wrong? Or is there a special reason? Please give me an instruction to avoid me and other readers from being suspicious. Respectfully submitted, Yu Fangjing</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Yu is to be admired for his ability to study quickhand characters in such detail and to offer several opinions.</p>
<p>We very much agree with his opinion, because since quickhand characters aim for simplicity, then of course we should adopt simpler characters. However, there is one point that Mr. Yu needs to understand: that is, although quickhand characters take simplicity as their goal, we must also pay attention to whether they are commonly used. At the same time, quickhand characters are only being promoted, not manufactured. Like the characters "马," "垒," and "昙" that Mr. Yu mentioned, many people are already using them, so of course there is a need to adopt them, but the writing of "县" is rarely seen. I think very few people probably recognize it, right? Since it is not common, it cannot be considered a "quickhand character" for the time being.</p>
<p>We know that no matter what we do, there are always some oversights in the beginning, and it must be improved by many parties before it can reach perfection. If we want quickhand characters to move forward, we must also have gradual improvements. Therefore, we hope that readers will deeply explore quickhand characters, and like Mr. Yu, contribute their own opinions at any time; at the same time, we also hope that readers will write down any simplified characters that they know and that have not been included in the three hundred characters and send them to us at any time. This column will release them as needed to serve as reference and adoption for those responsible for promoting them.</p>

<p>Opening "American Relief for Unemployment"  It is most pitiful to be unemployed, as it hinders the nation's economy and people's livelihood. If there is much unemployment in the country, the nation will naturally be weak and the people poor. America and Europe are the richest in the world, yet unemployment is still widespread. The administrative side has a great responsibility, so providing relief is important for the people's livelihood. Today, the newspaper reports that the people have something to look forward to, to live in peace and work happily, earning fourteen gold coins a week. How enviable is President Roosevelt of America, with his excellent policies that care for the people. Thinking of our China, which claims to be the greatest, vagrants are everywhere, a truly alarming sight. The strong take risks and seek fortune through danger, while the weak seek death by throwing themselves into the river to end their lives. What can be done when there is too little porridge for too many monks? How can people survive when there are too many people for too few jobs? It has turned into a world of bandits and robbers, and industry and commerce are too desolate. Considering the Three Principles of the People, with people's livelihood as the priority, how should the authorities mediate to revitalize China?</p>

The autumn insects chirp around the steps. I hear. The wild geese's language in the sky? I wait for that distant. The husband has not returned. So depressed. She sits, hand on her scented cheek. So quiet. She idly remembers the person far away. No news. Can my beloved be unfaithful? Leaving me. Where has he gone to pursue red skirts? Bang dong. The woodcutter's drum urges frequently. Marriage is vague. The embroidered quilt is left with the scent of incense. So lonely. The tooth bed is hard to share. So tired. I will go lie down and strum the sheng. So affectionate. A dim auspicious omen. So happy. In the embroidered pavilion, the wife meets her husband. Smiling. They hold hands and return to the silk bed. Whispering. They tell each other their feelings of separation in the quilt. So lingering. The joy of fish and water is boundless? The dew is dripping. The flowers bloom with passion. The wind rustles. The iron horse blows before the eaves. Shocked. The person is gone, though the dream was found. Waking up to the empty room again. The remaining lamp and setting moon are even more heartbreaking. Lying down to watch the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars.</p>

<p>A ruler must think that the people's resentment cannot do anything, so he dares to be tyrannical and oppressive; he must think that financial scarcity cannot do anything, so he dares to be lewd and extravagant; he must think that his subjects cannot do anything, so he dares to reject advice; he must think that exhausting soldiers cannot do anything, so he dares to act recklessly. These "what can be done's" are where evil deeds originate. If one does not explore the root of these things, then the words "what can be done," though containing the seeds of chaos, have not yet taken shape; though possessing the reality of something to be feared, have not yet left a trace. If one is not a wise and perceptive gentleman, who can stop the waves of disaster at their very beginning? (End)</p>
<p>Lapses in Etiquette at Alliances and Engagements The art of observing people lies in what is hidden, not what is obvious; in what is obscure, not what is clear. The obvious and the clear are what people fear. The hidden and the obscure are what people neglect. What people fear, even petty people know to adorn themselves. What people neglect, even gentlemen cannot be without fault. One's demeanor in public must be solemn even in private moments. One's words to guests must be strict even in casual conversation, especially during alliances, engagements, or tribute ceremonies. Gold and stone are in the courtyard; food vessels are on the mat; the ushers are in front; the three bows are below. A slight change in expression in the hall can become the laughingstock of the nation. A single word mistaken can give rise to ten thousand mouths criticizing. Human nature loves to win and hates to be humiliated; cannot one force oneself to be careful for even a moment?</p>

<h3 id="e245">The Cooperation Between the Construction Industry and the News Industry <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>—The Hartford Times Newspaper in the United States Holds an Architectural Exhibition—</p>
<p>Since its inception, this journal has collaborated with the architectural community to hold an architectural exhibition. Indeed, the evolution of the construction industry requires the cooperation of newspapers. Holding an architectural exhibition is a very common event, but for a newspaper to initiate such an exhibition is an uncommon occurrence, not only in China but also in the United States, where the construction industry is developed. Recently, the Hartford Times newspaper in Hartford, Connecticut, USA, held a large-scale architectural exhibition. The Hartford Times already had an architectural society with a three-year history. Initially, only a few small rooms were set aside in the newspaper office to display a small number of construction materials. Recently, the scope was expanded to hold a larger architectural exhibition, including materials such as wood, partitions, tiles, carpets, paints, wallpaper, oil, faucets, stoves, water heaters, roofing materials, flooring, bathroom fixtures, and more.</p>
<p>On the opening day, the mayor of Hartford, the Architectural Association, and construction material merchants all attended. Visitors were not limited to Hartford city residents but came from the surrounding suburbs as well. Because the newspaper had promoted the event beforehand, the number of visitors was larger than usual. On the day of the exhibition, the newspaper spared no expense in devoting significant space to publishing architectural articles and news. Furthermore, the Hartford Times has always had a special architectural section every Saturday, dedicating several pages to articles on modernizing residences, building real estate, and decorating. The Architectural Society also collaborated with experienced and capable individuals to conduct a thorough investigation, which yielded many valuable reports that could promote construction. The investigation lasted for six weeks, and the most valuable finding was that many people wanted to build houses but lacked plans, saying they were about to start planning. Others said they had the financial means to build houses, while some wanted to join the society to study architectural knowledge.</p>
<p>The Hartford Times realized that many people wanted to study architecture. Therefore, they moved the building models from the middle floor to the top floor, completely isolating it from the city hall. In this room, various gatherings were held, both in the evenings and afternoons. No fees were charged for joining the studies, allowing the general public to have the opportunity to study architectural science. The society also installed an electric kitchen, preparing to cook once or more per week, and offered various games. The membership reached at least 150 to 200 people. This architectural society was established in 1928, and its various activities were further developed after 1929. Looking back, the Hartford Times collected or borrowed photographs of several buildings and published photos of old houses in the newspaper, pointing out how to improve them and make them more modern. After the news spread, the first week the architectural special section was greatly expanded, many construction companies, construction material factories, and construction material retailers placed advertisements, with text occupying seven pages. Throughout 1929, the Saturday editions occupied twelve pages, sometimes increasing to sixteen pages. In addition to advertisements, there were many valuable articles and photographs. From then on, the Hartford Times has always paid extreme attention to the construction industry and architecture.</p>

<p>(4) Then close it again, lower the furnace temperature, and take out the wrought iron.</p>
<p>(5) Pour out the slag and pour into molds to cut into long strips or other shapes.</p>
<p>Section 3: Properties and Applications of Wrought Iron (1) Because wrought iron is cut into strips, it has a fibrous structure inside, with the direction the same as the cutting direction. If wrought iron is struck on a small clay board, the sound is very dull, which is a point of difference from the sound of steel.</p>
<p>Wrought iron does not rust easily, so it is often used as water pipe material.</p>
<p>The strength of wrought iron is far less than that of steel.</p>
<p>The market for wrought iron is also measured in tons, and its price is more expensive than pig iron.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Steel</p>
<p>Section 1: What is Steel</p>
<p>Steel is obtained by further forging pig iron that is smelted from iron ore. The principle is simply to remove and burn away the impurities contained in pig iron and add various required materials. As for steelmaking methods, there are the Open-hearth method, Bessemer method, carburizing method, crucible method, and electric furnace method, etc. These are described separately below:</p>
<p>Section 2: Open-Hearth Steelmaking Method</p>
<p>This method is a method of directly making steel from pig iron. The raw materials used, in addition to pig iron, also include scrap steel and iron ore. Therefore, there are specialized businesses that collect scrap steel and iron, which is for this purpose. The three materials are placed in the furnace and burned with intense heat. They are melted together, and the oxygen in the iron ore is automatically released to absorb the impurities in the pig iron and scrap steel, resulting in pure steel.</p>
<p>The steps of the process: The furnace walls must be built with alkaline bricks containing magnesium and calcium. When in use, pig iron, iron ore, and scrap steel are first piled into the furnace, and then limestone is added. Flames and air are introduced into the furnace. After seven or eight hours, sulfur and phosphorus can be removed, and the carbon content also reaches the lowest level. Then, a small amount of ferromanganese ore sand is added to maintain the carbon content, so it is not lost, and to drive away excess gas. A small door is opened to allow the molten steel to flow out and into molds to obtain steel ingots. These can be rolled into steel plates or steel strips by machines at will. The current method used by the Longhua Shanghai Steel Mill is the above method, but the output is only sufficient to supply the military and has not yet been exported to the construction industry.</p>
<p>The reason why alkaline materials are used for the walls is that pig iron and iron ore often contain phosphorus, which is harmful to the quality of steel and must be removed. Therefore, it is used to remove phosphorus. If the iron ore does not contain phosphorus, ordinary siliceous mud bricks can be used, which can save a lot of cost, as magnesium bricks are extremely expensive.</p>
<p>Section 3: Bessemer Steelmaking Method</p>
<p>The Bessemer method of steelmaking is different from the above method. In the above method, the impurities are removed with iron ore, while this method only uses heat to burn away the impurities contained in pig iron. After the impurities in the pig iron are burned away, an appropriate amount of carbon is added to form steel.</p>
<p>The steps of the process: First, put half a furnace of pig iron into the furnace. Use a pipe at the bottom of the furnace to force air in at a pressure of 20 pounds per square inch. The oxygen in the air combines with the silicon, magnesium, and other substances in the pig iron due to the high temperature, which can cause a yellow flame to appear. When the carbon in the pig iron is oxidized by further burning, the flame turns white. This indicates that it should not be burned any further, otherwise, the pig iron will also be oxidized. The supply of air is immediately stopped, and a little carbon or manganese is added to form steel.</p>
<p>Section 4: Carburizing Method</p>
<p>This is an ancient method of forging high-grade steel materials, but it is very costly. The forging does not involve mixing with other materials but only adding a carbonaceous material, hence the name carburizing method:</p>
<p>The steps of the process: Place wrought iron into a small box of carbon powder and heat at a temperature of 1500 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit for several days. At that time, every 20 hours, the iron can absorb 1/6 of an inch of carbon. After it is successfully removed from the box, gradually let it cool, and it can be used.</p>
<p>Section 5: Crucible Steelmaking Method</p>
<p>The crucible steelmaking method is also one of the forging methods of high-grade steel materials and also uses closed burning, but it is a newer method than the previous method. How is it faster and better than the previous method? First, put wrought iron into a graphite crucible that has been pre-filled with a considerable amount of carbon. The crucible is sealed airtight, and the crucible can hold about 75 to 100 pounds of iron. Burn with intense heat for five hours. The iron is dissolved and mixed with carbon to form steel. It is poured from the crucible into a mold and can be used in the market.</p>

<p>— Mei Huanzhen</p>
<p>Hip - Assuming the roof has a slope with three sides draining water. The raised area between the two is the roof ridge. This ridge is called the Hip.</p>
<p>Nogging Piece - When building a wall to a certain height or length. The first thing to pay attention to is the "protection" method of the wall. A two-by-four inch pine wood is placed in the center of the wall and nailed on both ends. This is called a Nogging Piece. It is indispensable when building a five-inch wall.</p>
<p>Red Lead - Whether it is ironware or wood. The first coat of primer is mostly made with red lead. Because its properties can prevent ironware or wood from rusting and rotting.</p>
<p>Ear - Anything that protrudes. Like an Archattave, soaring at both ends of the Lintel, shaped like an animal's ears. Scissors Brace - The phase-long material between the Joist files is used to firm the Gutter itself and prevent it from shaking. This is called a scissor brace. (A flat-topped gutter is not suitable.)</p>
<p>Center To Center - This means the distance between the middle from one side to the other. The cut in the construction site is called Center To Center.</p>
<p>Outside Line - Measuring a house, such as the dimensions of the exterior wall and exterior wall, is called Outside Line. Conversely, the dimensions of the Interior Wall and the interior wall are called the In inside Line.</p>
<p>Deviation - When the wall is gradually built up, if the plasterer assumes it is "so-so". Then. For work, it may be withdrawn and polluted. For example, do not take lines, do not scrape buckets, do not pull seams, and so on. The important thing is not to take the line. This situation is inevitable. Because when the bricks are casually placed on the wall with ash and sand without tapping the line, the deviation can be found within the height of one zhang. Deviation means that the wall is sloping outwards, and some places are tilting inwards. This is called exempt. If a deviation is found on the wall, this crime will be blamed on the supervisor's failure to monitor and correct the problem. Therefore, the Foreman in the construction site should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Load Bearing - A large material that rests on the wall and can be used to place the joists on it.</p>
<p>Truss - Its organization includes the Trimming Beam, the Principa wood, the King Post, the Queen Post, the Strut, the Purling, the Common Rattor, the Creeping, and other names.</p>
<p>Eyebrow Iron - The lower cap of a double iron door is equipped with two small turntables. This turntable can move on two curved iron rails. This rail should be called eyebrow iron in the construction site. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e248">Talking about Cement <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The ancient Romans already knew that after grinding and mixing volcanic ash and lime, adding water and mixing, they could gradually solidify. This antique cement is still very strong and perfectly preserved in many places. The cement on the market today is actually just blast furnace slag and lime ground together. In China, because steel manufacturing has not yet been developed, we use clay to replace blast furnace slag. This manufacturing method is actually exactly the same as the Roman method.</p>
<p>The components of cement. Generally speaking, they are calcium oxide, aluminum trioxide, silicon dioxide, iron trioxide, magnesium oxide, etc., but they are all in a combined state. The combination of these many oxides does not give us any conclusions from chemical analysis. Therefore, this problem has been a matter of debate among scholars for fifty years since Lai Qitali Lo Chatlier. Based on the theories of various schools, we can boldly say that cement contains and a small amount of Magnesium oxide is usually no longer combined with other things. If we only manage these oxides and no longer look at their mutual combination, then the composition of cement can be expressed as follows.</p>
<p>Calcium oxide 63 percent</p>
<p>Aluminum trioxide 6.5 percent</p>
<p>Silicon dioxide 21.5 percent</p>
<p>Iron trioxide 2.5 percent</p>
<p>Magnesium oxide 2.5 percent</p>
<p>Sulfur trioxide 1.5 percent</p>
<p>There are two methods for manufacturing cement: the dry method and the wet method. The wet method is popular in Europe. The dry method is a relatively new method invented by the Americans. These two methods are largely the same. In the wet method, limestone and clay are mixed with water, then ground finely and baked into small pieces. In the dry method, the raw materials are first dried, then ground finely, and then baked into small pieces. The baking temperature is about 1400 to 1600 degrees Celsius. At this time, these raw materials are in a semi-molten state. Because they are baked in a rotary kiln, these semi-molten things stick together, becoming hard blocks about the size of walnuts. After cooling, these hard blocks are ground finely by machines, and you get cement. The rotary kiln used to manufacture cement is a very long and large round tube laid flat. The diameter of this round tube is about seven to nine feet, and the length is one to two hundred feet. It rotates very slowly, about once or twice every minute.</p>
<p>The above outlines some common knowledge about cement. Below, I am going to talk about some recent trends in cement research.</p>
<p>In recent years, the phenomenon of heat generation during cement solidification has attracted great attention. According to the experiments of Danwei and Fox, the temperature of huge ternary soil buildings, such as dams, dikes, and bridge piers, can rise to 50 or 70 degrees Celsius during solidification. When the temperature of this type of building gradually cools down, the cement has already solidified, but objects expand when heated and contract when cooled. Cement, which has solidified and hardened during cooling, will crack due to contraction. To avoid cracks in buildings, the heat released by cement must be reduced. According to recent tests, the amount of heat released is greatest for tricalcium aluminate, second for tricalcium silicate, and the smallest for dicalcium silicate. Therefore, the architectural community today has great hope for cement with excellent properties and low heat release.</p>
<p>How does cement that has solidified erode when it encounters seawater or acid solutions? This is also a major problem today.</p>
<p>Solutions such as sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium sulfate can all erode ternary soil, and the extent of erosion depends on the concentration of these sulfates and the condition of the ternary soil. Generally, calcium hydroxide in cement reacts with acid to form calcium sulfate, and hydrated calcium aluminate becomes calcium sulfoaluminate. Both of these effects can cause ternary soil to expand and disintegrate. The effect is more severe in magnesium sulfate solutions. Because of the condition, its FH value is 10.5 at this time, which is much lower than that required to maintain hydrated calcium silicate in a stable state. Therefore, hydrated silicate calcium undergoes hydrolysis, generating several calcium hydroxides. This newly formed calcium hydroxide then reacts with magnesium sulfate to produce calcium sulfate and magnesium hydroxide. The hydroxide of magnesium in the solution continues to be in a saturated state, so the hydrated acid calcium continues to hydrolyze. This process is repeated over and over again until the small pores of the ternary soil are filled with magnesium hydroxide precipitates, making the process slow down and gradually stop. The cement has been heavily eroded and gradually becomes loose.</p>
<p>For ternary soils that must be eroded by seawater or acids, special cement, such as alumina cement, should be selected during construction, which will be more durable.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Preliminary Proposal for Establishing the Ruan Lingyu Acting Award <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Xudong</p>
<p>The tragic death of Ruan Lingyu has caused immense sorrow to those who care about Chinese cinema. This is because Ruan Lingyu's death is a loss to the Chinese film industry. Due to her suicide, people cannot forget Ai Xia's suicide a year ago. Thus, people cannot help but say with sorrow: The suicides of film actors have become a trend. For the future growth of Chinese cinema, we must do our best to curb this undesirable trend. Furthermore, Ruan Lingyu's death cannot but have a negative impact on people. In this distressing era, it is a terrifying hint to those who are timidly struggling in distress. Then this cannot but be something that deserves our concern even more. Moreover, news of youth suicides is constantly appearing in newspapers, although this is not necessarily due to Ruan Lingyu's influence.</p>
<p>Because Ruan Lingyu's suicide followed Ai Xia's, people are passionately exploring the reasons for the cowardice of Chinese film actresses. I remember this publication's article "In Memory of Ms. Ruan Lingyu" pointed out the cause of her death: Due to the contradiction between the pursuit of an upward spiritual life and the pursuit of an upward material life, she could not find an appropriate solution in this contradiction. That is to say, she could not escape the pain of this contradiction. She could not bravely sacrifice personal enjoyment and dedicate herself to a great future. Thus, she cowardly committed suicide. Others have correctly pointed out that Ai Xia's death was due to her inability to move from the current stage of capitalism to a new future, while Ruan Lingyu was unable to, like Ibsen's Nora, attain the social status that one should have in this current stage from the position of a little squirrel.</p>
<p>Therefore, due to this tragic lesson, we should ignite the torch of indignation from the regret for the death of an artist and from the resentment of the evil forces of society, and bravely shout in the darkness to march towards a bright future. In particular, film actors should awaken from this tragedy, deeply understand reality, and more accurately understand the historically decisive future. Then, they should promote their knowledge and confidence through film art. At the same time, they should simplify, make plain, and scientific their private lives as much as possible, and devote their lives to the struggle of art. Only in this way can there be a great artistic future, only in this way can we truly learn a valuable lesson from Ruan Lingyu's tragic death and practice it bravely, and only in this way can we most meaningfully commemorate Ruan Lingyu.</p>
<p>Of course, we dare to say that Ruan Lingyu is worth commemorating, but it does not seem that casting a bronze statue is enough. What is needed is to go beyond formal commemoration and become a powerful encouragement for general actors in life and art. That is to say, from the change of life to the effort of acting, as the most genuine commemoration. Therefore, here is a proposal to establish the Ruan Lingyu Acting Award.</p>
<p>We know that there are various academic awards in foreign countries. The famous Nobel Prize is a good example, and in the United States, there is also an annual award ceremony related to film. However, in China, such an organization is still lacking. It cannot be said that people in our society do not have a deep concern for films. Now, in principle, people probably will not oppose the realization of the performing arts award, because this will help the progress of Chinese films in any case. However, now after Ruan Lingyu's death, we believe that this kind of award is more meaningful and necessary. As mentioned above, if film actors want to have great achievements in acting, they must deeply appreciate reality. At the same time, they need to minimize and even eliminate the contradictions between personal life desires and artistic activities. In other words, they should devote their entire body to artistic labor and completely dedicate themselves to the future of art. Furthermore, there must be no contradiction between life and will. An actor who truly serves the social group must cultivate a spirit of hard work and endurance in life. Immersing oneself in a decadent life or love entanglements all day long cannot lead to great achievements in art. If life and will are completely unified, if artistic exploration is elevated above the desires of life, then suicide due to personal distress will not accidentally happen. Needless to say, the glorious award should be won by those who truly strive for film art. This kind of glory and encouragement will definitely be helpful to the progress of Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>However, it must be earnestly stated that this kind of award is best obtained truly from society. It must be obtained from the people who care about Chinese cinema and lament Ruan Lingyu's death, so that it will have greater significance. As for how much funding to raise, and what methods to use to raise it, how to manage it, and how to select the winners, etc., we must wait for the readers—especially those engaged in the film industry—to put forward valuable opinions. This is just a preliminary proposal.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e250">Review of "The Man Who Reclaimed His Head" <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Man Who Reclaimed His Head</p>
<p>—Great Shanghai—</p>
<p>In order to introduce this film to the Shanghai audience, the entire story must be briefly narrated here.</p>
<p>The subtitles show "Paris—1915". What unfolds on the screen is the German air force raiding Paris at night. The sirens blare, the searchlights illuminate, the planes bomb, and all the lights in the city go out. In the tense atmosphere, a young protagonist in military uniform, holding his young daughter and carrying a suitcase, staggers to the door of his former classmate, now a lawyer. Upon meeting, the protagonist, with tears in his eyes, recounts his past:</p>
<p>This young protagonist is named Wan Lin. He is an unsuccessful writer. One year before World War I, he lived with his beloved wife and young daughter in a quiet place in Paris. On a carnival night, news mogul Tan Meng visits Wan Lin and asks him to write current affairs articles on his behalf, under Tan Meng's name. Wan Lin initially refuses, believing that this is inappropriate behavior. However, life forces him, coupled with the persuasion of his wife who desires a comfortable life, to start writing articles for Tan. Wan Lin has always advocated peace, so he publishes speeches opposing war and promoting peace. As a result, Tan Meng's name is enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole country. At this time, Wan Lin feels very comforted in spirit, in addition to having a happy life. At the same time, Wan Lin's wife also has the opportunity to go in and out of Tan Meng in the expensive social circles. The beautiful music and dance make her deeply intoxicated.</p>
<p>However, because the anti-war tone in the newspaper is too high, on the one hand, it makes the people excited, but at the same time, it worries the general arms dealers, because they are trying to profit from the war. So the arms dealers give Tan Meng a huge amount of money, so that he changes from being against war to advocating war. Of course, this is exactly what the despicable Tan Meng wants, originally he was making profits by commenting. Therefore, he suddenly changes his attitude and takes the opportunity to advocate war. When Wan Lin goes to question him, his reason is for the country, for the sake of loving the motherland. Precisely because Tan Meng's name has always been admired by people, his advocacy has also aroused the frenzy of the blindly following the nation to participate in the war. Wan Lin accidentally puts forward the idea of anti-war, but is beaten by the masses. At this time, Tan Meng is in a warship discussing making money with the arms dealers.</p>
<p>When the war breaks out, Wan Lin is drafted to the front line. Needless to say, he tastes the pain of war. At the same time, his wife and daughter at home also miss him very sadly. When the wife receives a letter from her husband, and the little daughter asks her mother to read the letter to her, the painful heaviness cannot but make people shed tears. At the train station, when Wan Lin is reading a letter from home, he suddenly hears from someone who witnessed his beloved wife and Tan Meng being intimate in the theater, talking about Tan Meng's various misdeeds, even that he could not ask for leave to go home was also Tan Meng's doing. So in anger, he flees back to Paris. It is the night of the German bombing of Paris. In the terror of the war, he returns home and happens to see Tan Meng forcibly kissing his beloved wife. So he kills him madly, cuts off his head, and takes his beloved daughter to the lawyer's house.</p>
<p>The story ends here. He asks the lawyer to defend him. The lawyer asks the official to arrest him, and his wife also rushes over. They cry bitterly at each other, but the lawyer promises to defend him with all his strength. In this story, it is very clear to see the most valuable points, that is, the author of the original stage play, Jean Bart, understanding of the nature of war. The instigators of World War I were precisely capitalists such as arms dealers. In order to expand and divide the colonial market, and in order to sell their arms, they needed war. At the same time, the leaders of the imperialist press could opportunistically use anti-war arguments to win the hearts of readers (although they may not have to, as they can buy the highest reputation with money, this is the true color of so-called famous scholars). However, when they establish close ties with capitalists, loving the country becomes their best excuse, and for the pure readers, under the highest reputation, when they have already gained their belief, the effect of this deception is extremely great. The explanation of this nature has established the foundation for the success of the work. In addition, the side matching of the moral baseness and life of famous scholars and the frontal depiction of the cruelty of war, further increase the effect of the play, although we also have to point out that individual heroism, using public anger and private vengeance to punish traitors, is not the right way to oppose imperialist war.</p>
<p>In terms of the screenwriting techniques of the film, we seem to be able to point out: There is little depiction of the various cruelties Wan Lin experienced on the battlefield, which inevitably reduces the power of stimulation. As for the narrative of the recollection method, on the one hand, it can avoid the difficulty of connecting the air of the drama after the protagonist kills, immediately followed by the various sorrows in the lawyer's home. On the other hand, the main story, the step-by-step tense air, is not lost. However, people may feel some degree of dullness, but this cannot be said to be a failure of the director Edward Ludwig. On the contrary, he seriously treated his product with the art of film. As for the acting skills of the protagonist Claude Rains, in "Crime Without Passion", he played an extremely treacherous and evil lawyer, and has already shown great brilliance. Now here, he is a completely opposite righteous and awe-inspiring youth, and is also very conscientious. His future is truly limitless.</p>

<p>— Meng Si</p>
<p>—Ernst Lubitsch, who is famous for directing American-style erotic films, recently made a big joke! It turned out that he set up a gorgeous and exquisite lunch in his villa in New York, ready to invite a few friends to have a big meal; however, unfortunately; when he scolded the car to rush to be the host, he found that everything was arranged very well, but—there was not a single guest! Because he was busy with work, he forgot all about inviting guests, so that day's feast was only enjoyed by him alone.</p>

<h3 id="e252">The Hate of a Vanquished Country of India (Clive of India) (3) <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>Many of Margaret's close friends felt that this incident was absurd and funny, and advised her not to agree, but Margaret, like the person who wrote to her, was a person with a different view. She decided her own future. Clive also seemed to know Margaret deeply, and since writing the letter, he had been looking forward to her arrival in India every day. He was not worried that she would not come. What he was worried about was how to make a career before she arrived.</p>
<p>At this time, the British fortress of Trichinopoly had been under siege by the French army for a long time. That was where Clive and Edmund were sent to rescue, but now they were in a desperate situation. The British army fought hard for several months and could not break through the French army's heavy siege, and it seemed that they could no longer support it. On such a night of hopeless despair, Clive and Edmund stood on the fortress's city wall. The city wall was probably more than two zhang high, with a moat below, flowing with turbid mud water. It was dark on all sides, with only the flashes of artillery fire, and one could see some east, west, north, and south. Clive looked down, and suddenly crossed one foot over the city wall.</p>
<p>Edmund quickly grabbed him and asked in horror, "What are you doing?" Clive gritted his teeth and said, "I'm going to ask for reinforcements. What's wrong with that?" Edmund said, "You're abandoning your duty and will be shot!" Clive pushed away Edmund's hand and said, "If I don't go, we'll all be shot." As soon as he said that, his foot had already crossed over. He squatted on the city wall, as if about to jump. Edmund shouted: "It's more than two zhang high, how can you jump?" Clive held onto the city wall with both hands, and his two feet were already suspended in the air. Edmund said anxiously, "How to report to the commander?" In a glimpse of the artillery fire, Edmund saw Clive's habitual smirk. He said, "Tell him to persevere to the end and wait for me to come back." After he finished speaking, his body was already down. .</p>
<p>In the council hall of Fort St. David, Governor Pigot was holding an emergency meeting. A group of East India Trading Company tycoons, Manning, Warburton, Pemberton, and Cundall, were all looking at each other, at a loss what to do. Then everyone looked around, each unwilling to look at the other, expressing the despair and the misery of doom. Captain Clarke sent in a recent report, saying that the British army was already in an urn, and there were only one hundred and twenty men left under his command. The general trend was irreversible. ,</p>
<p>Suddenly, a filthy and ragged man rushed in. His broken leather boots, with every step he took, the mud inside would oozed out. The military uniform on his body was already full of holes, revealing the muddy and dirty flesh inside. Everyone looked at it and opened their mouths in horror. Manning was the first to shout, "Clive, what are you doing here?" The man did not say a word, grabbed a chair, sat down, and began to poke at the broken clothes on his body. Pemberton shouted angrily, "What are you doing? This is not your bedroom!" Clive had already taken off the shirt on his upper body and wiped the mud and sweat from his shoulders. He said slowly, "Need is anyone's bedroom."</p>
<p>He turned his head and said to Captain Clarke, "Get some clean clothes." He also saw that there was some drink left in the large bowl on the table, so he poured it into a cup and drank it like a cow. After he finished drinking the water, he said to everyone, "Gentlemen, you have no army. Trichinopoly will soon be lost! And you! You will be looted first. Finally, gentlemen, it will be a massacre, a slaughter!" Everyone listened, looking at him listlessly. What was this news? But Governor Pigot asked kindly, "Then what is your suggestion?"
