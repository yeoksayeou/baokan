<h3>經濟業談</h3>
<p>— 唐慶增主編</p>
<h3>中國的絲</h3>
<p>— 錢天達</p>
<p>蠶絲在吾國有數千年之歷史，育蠶製絲區域幾與吾國版圖同其大小，實為農村中最普遍及最重要副業之一，對外貿易，允佔重要地位。自絲業失敗，而農村經濟破產，都市經濟衰落，影響所及，整個國民經濟，亦有總崩潰之虞。顧以國內政局不定，各業凋零，致此嚴重問題，未為國人注意，雖有改良會等設立，亦為權力財力所限，不能收理想統制之效。茲將吾國蠶絲失敗之經過及其重耍性作一簡明之叙述以引起國人之注意，並供關心蠶絲事業及國民經濟者之參考焉。</p>
<p>考吾國蠶絲最初輸出者為成製品，若絹繪等是，及外國紡織事業發達，而絲料之輸出遂有超過絲貨之趨勢，但此時之蠶絲與絲貨，均屬手工業品也。至一八六七年廣東陳啟元氏始創新式絲廠，改舊有之手工業為機械工業，中國絲業至此，始顯有改良之象。（上海在一八八一年（光緒七年）有黃佐卿者，創設一廠於北蘇州河畔，名公和永，其後無錫裕昌絲廠等遂先後設立，）然自二十世紀初年而後，日本突起競爭，以科學之方法鍊製，以新式之機械作業，產量旣多，絲質又佳，歐美各國，爭相購置，而我國絲業界在此時期，不特無積極進取之心，且墨守成法，故步自封，是時政府亦無嚴密之商品檢騐制度，因循坐誤，遂致海外市塲，拱手讓人而莫可挽救，殊可惜也。</p>
<p>近十年出口生絲减少趨勢表</p>
<p>一九二九年後，世界經濟恐慌爆發，各國購買力减退，華絲銷路，更形縮减，其間雖銀價下落，然仍無補於輸出，一九三一年日本金再禁後，藉貨幣價格之下落，及其政府雄厚之津貼，故日絲輪出雖在此恐慌深淵中，尙能勉强支持，然華絲至此，則更瞠乎後矣。民國十九年上海B字廠絲最高價為每擔一千一百五十兩，最低價達八日八十兩，可知自十九年起，絲價巳有步跌之勢，爰有請求政府，發行公債以挽危局，經絲商之一再請願，二十年果蒙政府批准，免納出口稅，並發行公債八百萬元，以事救濟，以四分之一改良蠶桑，四分之一改良絲廠設備，四分之二發於江浙絲廠，實施救濟。二十一年一二八之後，市面蕭條，國內絲業益覺無法維持，絲價竟跌至五百四十兩，銷路呆滯，積貨更多，絲商益覺無法周轉，乃有第二决公債之發行，辦理陳絲陳繭登記，獎勵出口生絲每擔銀一百元，並免微關稅，至三十二年春方辦結束，但此種辦法，祗一時權宜之計，况亦杯水車薪，無裨整個絲業之進展。二十三年（一九三四）三四月間，因美國提高物價，華絲銷路略見暢旺，而價格亦因之提高　吾人方祈其如靑雲之直上，不料入秋後又一蹶不復振，售價旣低，銷路更滯，廠商受累不堪，今年春（二十四年）叉以美實施購銀政策，銀價提高甚速，自每盎斯三角左右漲至七角以上，華絲輸出更受阻碍，市價且跌入四百元，絲業幾陷於萬刦不復之地，春繭登塲而後，絲市遂步進展，距最低價已漲起一倍左右，新貨幣政策實施，因對外匯兌之暴縮，國內絲價漲風更熾，出口數量，亦大見增加，今年六月至十月之中，出口巳二萬包。觀乎最近美國生絲消費之日漸增加，華絲復與前途實有重大希望，不特國際貿易可以挽回頹勢，即農村經濟亦類續命之湯，蓋我國農村經濟向恃農作物收穫以外之副業，以為調劑，在黃河流城諸省區之農村農民副業，不甚發達，故不如江浙農村之充裕。農村副業，向以蠶絲為最有利，江浙以外，如四川廣東山東各有，農家亦多倚賴春蘭之收獲，以資周轉，甚至衣食之需，亦多仰給於此，徒以缺乏準確之統計材料，足資佐證，故未為一般人所注意。至於吾國絲業於對外貿易上地位之重要，則不必費辭，閱下列二簡明之表，即可瞭然；</p>
<p>重要出口物品比較表（單位百萬海關兩）</p>
<p>由上列二表觀之，生絲在對外貿易上地位之重要，積極方面可以增加國家財富，消極方面亦可抵消若干債務，平衡國際支出。自華茶失敗，對外貿易，幾全頓生絲為挹注，故生絲之地位，益為重要，新貨幣政策實施，滙兌管理，實為統制國際貿易之先聲，吾人深望對外貿易，能在新滙　穩定政策下而逐漸發展，更盼國際收支，亦在入口貨物减少，出口貨物激增條件下而趨於平衡也。</p>

<p>漢口通信，武漢中等以上學校全體學生，連日舉行大規模示威遊行，並因建廳停止輪渡交通，露宿江干，不避飢寒，其愛國情緒之緊張，予武漢人民以莫大之興奮，綏靖主任何成濬，省府代主席盧鑄，敎育廳長程其保，巿長吳　楨，警備司令陳繼承等，以學生此種舉動，純為愛國熱忱驅使，如能嚴守紀律，自難加以遏止，因允武昌學生，於二十二·二十三兩日，分批渡漢遊行，學生目的，至是完全逹到，二十二日上午九時，規定第一批渡江之學校學生，在漢陽門總集合，計有武漢大學，華中大學，藝專，三楚中學，實騐學校，安徽中學，大江中學，善導女中，成逹女中，省一女中，武昌女職，武昌師範，菱湖中學，荆南中學，省立高商，武昌初中，文華圖書專校，博文中學，張楚中學等十九校，共計二千餘人，卽由漢陽門碼頭，分乘普安建漢倉漢三輪渡江，在漢口王家巷碼頭登岸，漢口懿訓女中，聖嘉納女中等校學生，在江岸熱烈歡迎，旋卽隨同遊行，推武大代表為總指揮，華大代表為副指揮，自王家巷出發，經過民權路·三民路·巿政府·濟生四馬路·三馬路·六渡橋·民生路至江漢關，沿高呼口號，悲壯激昂，兩旁民眾，觀者如堵，均鼓掌表示同情，經過之處，交通暫告斷絕，警士加崗維持秩序，宣傳隊除沿途散發傅單外，並作簡單講演，巿民多感泣下，午後一時半，全體到逹江漢關，觀眾尤擁擠，而學生所呼之救國口號，聲震山岳，倍覺興奮游行完畢，由一碼頭仍乘建漢等天輪返武昌，小學生又組織慰勞隊，在漢陽門歡迎，分贈食品，三時許分別散隊返校，至第二批學生，則定于二十三日渡江敎育廳長程其保，對此次學生運動，發表談話，略云，「此次學生愛國運動，自北平發動以來，天津·南京·上海·武漢·長沙，此亦青年學子，本良心主張，一種愛國情緒之表現，敎育當局，固無可非議，惟是青年血氣方剛，必須抑壓一時情感，運用理智，以從事此種運動，一舉一動，總期合乎常軌，蓋今日國家處境之艱難，實不容不如是也，且救國工作，亦非一朝一夕，所可成就，若久耗寶貴光陰是不但無補於國家，且有損個人學業，亦為國家之損失，故敎部王部長于致平敎界電中，諄諄以「讀書救國」相勉，予所望于武漢同學者，亦卽在此，連日武漢同學種種行動，已足表現其愛國精神，而武昌同學要求渡漢，亦已如願以償，各校當于卽日照常上課一，</p>
<p>續信，武昌第二批學生，為中華大學·敎育學院·文化中學·文華二部·大公中學·武昌職業·羣化中學·鄉村師範·第二女中·鄂南中學·武昌中學·旅鄂湖南女職·育傑中學·張楚中學·楚材中學·省立高中·啟黃中學·文化中學·高等農業·武大農業玫等二十一校，學生八千餘人，二十三日！　九　　　保隆·武安·建漢·倉漢四輪·第二批渡漢·在漢口王家巷碼頭登岸，雞鶴出發進行，漢口學生參加者　心勉女中，　智中學，博學中學·光華中學·　　中學等五校，漢陽高等工業，訓女中學·漢陽初中·効智中學四校學生，則在三民路總理銅像四週，列隊迎候，迨武昌漢口學生大隊經過時，卽行加入，共計一萬餘人，遊行路綫，先照二十二日規定，行經民權路·三民路·巿府路·至中山路後，臨時變更路線，改由交通路出後花樓，再回民生路，嗣因部學生，欲對某商店有所表示反對要求出後花樓，經江漢路而至江漢關，當時有多人加以勸阻，但學生激昂萬分，竟席地而坐，擬不前進，因此游行大隊，仍出後花樓經江漢路而至一碼頭，此一段中，軍警戒備森嚴，學生呼口號，亦最激昂，沿途有照相者，攝影機均被學生取去，午後一時半，到逹江漢關前，萬餘學生，同呼口號，歷半小時，武漢學生，與漢口漢陽學生告別，仍登輪南返，歸途經建設廳，因該廳停駛輪渡之故，羣往向建廳長劉壽朋質問，劉避不見面，該廳一部份什物，遂被搗毀，但未釀成事端，武漢之學生運動，至此將告一段落矣，（二十三日）</p>
<h3>唯一製糖企業　濟南溥益糖廠　毎日可制糖十二萬斤　惜原料甚缺不敷供應</h3>
<p>濟南通信，我國用糖，多仰賴英日，海關統計，每年輸入外糖價値一萬萬三千萬元，我國甜菜製糖廠，僅有濟南之溥益廠·與四川·廣東·等三處，此三處之中，尤以溥益為最大，該廠原為前北平巿長袁良等所組織，資本五百餘萬元，設備之初，費去三百五十萬元，祇機器一項，已逹二百萬元，規模宏大，機器亦新穎，民國十年創立，惜經理不得其人，兼以遭遇戰事銷路阻塞，遂致停頓，去年袁良又聯絡孫連仲等，募集股本，圖謀復活，舊股東機器作價一百二十萬元，另加入新股若干萬元，購買甜菜種子，發與農民種植，一方添聘技師，整理機器，至現在甜菜收獲，正較弱運來，該廠乃開工製造，本月十五日，已有出品運往巿塲銷售，並决開闢西經一帶銷路，藉以挽回一部分利權，惜乎今年災頻仍，甜菜歉收，未能逹到預想之數字，所收甜菜，大約僅敷一個月之用，一旦原料用罄，勢須改途掣造酒精，（該廠附設有酒精廠）專待明年再推廣種植，我國糖市塲，爲舶來品所盤踞，垂數十年，國人渴望自製糖，情甚殷切，預料該廠前途發展，未可限量，茲紀該廠現況如次，</p>
<p>原料種植製糖用甜菜，大都爲蘿葡類，種子在德國購買，該廠今夏分與農民種植，其范圍在黃河上下游·及小清河兩岸，原種植二萬五千畝，詎意災患頻來，先為旱魃，次為水災，僅餘一萬餘畝，每畝產甜菜三千斤至五千斤，因以前農民對該廠無甚信仰，故今年該廠在種植時，卽先將價値定妥，每千斤送到廠內，價洋八元，不送八元，不送到者，按路程遠近，扣除運費，種子每斤一元三角，售於種戶，預支肥料費者，每斤三角，不預支肥料費者一角，種價肥料價，均從菜價內扣除，平均種戶，每畝除開支外，可凈獲利二十餘元，較種植其他榖類，獲利甚厚，今年全省種甜菜一萬畝，共計獲利二十餘萬元，於枯窘之農村經濟，不無小補也，現在業已收獲，連日正陸續向濟南運送，因種植者多濱河，故多用船載來，另以驢·車·運至廠內，肩摩踵接，儼然鬧市，</p>
<p>製糖程序</p>
<p>甜菜到廠內後，先用輕便車裝運至過磅處，過磅後，卽運入磚砌之長方池內，因帶泥土甚多，故由廠後小清河開溝，引水入院，由工人用鐵锨撥入水內冲洗，水流甚急，卽利用水之冲力，冲入廠房之內，再用水車將甜菜輪轉入上層鐵槽內，再度洗凈之後，卽用機力運至樓上過磅器內，每足五千斤，卽自動漏下，再承受以後漏下者，由過磅器漏下，卽開始砌成細條，再將細條轉運至上層，入數十個圓形汽鍋溶煮三遍後，化成白色濃液體，其渣滓則由鐵管內輸至廠外，其液體為製糖之原料，卽入熬糖罐內熬煎，經過熬糖罐十餘個，熱度依次加高最　，卽成英紅色濃液禮，形如蜂蜜　後再入　蜜器，將蜜分出，留作製酒　　料，　餘　成白色之糖，另送至一室內，十餘工人，用鐵锨堆培，形如堆　，再由　室　下，過磅白色，掣糖手續，至此卽告完成，因全用電機，　甜菜由廠之東　入，至西端卽製成白糖，手續甚快，　送出之甜菜渣滓，無代價供附近鄉民飼豖之用，聞德國糖廠，能　渣滓掣成肥料，</p>
<p>營業槪況</p>
<p>甜菜每十斤，可製糖一百二十斤至一百三十斤，成本每百斤約需十二元之譜，現在巿價，每百斤十七元，預計每百斤可餘利五元，出品之初，本巿現已有德須成　記包銷，三并亦在接洽中，用戶對國產糖，多樂食用，該糖將來並注意西北一帶之銷路，大有供不應求之勢，該廠機器馬力開足，每日可製鈦材五百噸，產糖十二萬斤，價値兩萬元左右，盈利約六千元，本年原料歉收，約計僅敷二十日之用，今年計畫復活之初，以為原料若能收足預定之數，製糖工作，可到明年二月中旬，以後天暖，不宜製糖，改製酒精，今原料旣不敷兩個半月之用，只有提前製造酒精，以免躭誤工作，又該廠前以廠中機器，每年工作僅有半年，曾擬運南洋一帶糖料，（卽粗糖）來濟提煉精糖，行銷各處，亦可獲利，曾向當局請求免稅運輸，但結果未蒙核准，故前項計劃，又暫作停頓，（二十二日）</p>
<h3>潮安緝獲私貨　榮記貨物全充公　某洋行出面庇護</h3>
<p>汕頭通信，潮汕私貨，充斥巿面，尤以花生仁·生油·洋米·大豆·各種雜糧為多，私運者，計有三十八家商行洋行，彼輩組成一會社，資本雄厚，且有外力為護符，在潮安揭陽各城巿，設有支店及分行，油米豆等私貨，從外埠大帮運入油頭後，　存有烏橋大貨倉中，倉前為韓江支流出處，水路船舶運輸，極稱利便，該項私貨到汕後，旣，不納農產稅，所以每担價値，比華商販運者為廉，如生油每担，卽廉五元餘，此項私貨，從外埠排山倒海而至，旣攙奪華商巿塲，復使稅收銳减，當局乃加緊緝私，并由全省水陸緝私副處長范展鵬，率緝私特務員督察員等到潮汕佈置緝私綱，嚴厲查緝，一時空氣頗覺緊張，汕巿區內馬路傍之貧民住宅區內，原有無數擺賣米豆攤位，據說，係某商行寄售者，每日賣出若干，則浄得扣佣若干，自緝私嚴密施行後，此等米攤，無形收歇者十之七八，又烏橋某貨倉中，米豆堆積如山，亦無法銷售，惟某國商人，每次將私貨運入內地，必派一浪人隨前往，以為保護，有時私貨之船經過各鄉村圩鎭時，沿途分散發賣，於是貪利的商人，仍有不少販賣該項私貨，如潮安城榮記號，乃一大油廠主人所開，向採辦國產花生仁榨油發賣，近乃轉向某國商人，辦入大帮私貨花生仁，同時在汕向華商辦有少數納稅貨，混合攙用，且以有稅之袋面，貼有印花，故每將袋保存作下次之用，此為商人機巧之用心，本月十一日，潮安緝私員，見有挑伕運大帮無稅生仁往榮記，當將挑伕及貨中途截獲，挑伕供出受僱於榮記者凡十餘人，最近十餘天，每日向某洋行挑運貨物往榮記，彼只得一些脚力云，緝私分處，卽派隊將榮記夥伴拘獲數人，并歸店內貨物，全數扣留充公處辦，店主某，已逃匿某處，榮記店夥苦力等，押到汕頭，汕某南北行，以榮記向來向該號交易，該號售出之貨欵，尚未收回，現被充公之花生仁，袋面有蓋明某號兌出字樣，且執有轉運證，所以未貼在包面者，實係船伕之誤，乃投詞汕頭南北行·雜糧·油業·三公會，請轉呈轉請汕頭緝私主任，將一部已完稅豆仁發還，以顧商人血本，同時潮安某外商洋行，又出面庇護，稱榮記之貨，為彼寄售者，緝私處以此案關係重大，對雙方請求，不敢主意，經急電省東，將治以重典，（十八日）</p>

<h3>南通　狼福渡夜間已通航</h3>
<p>南通常熟間江面極闊，惟暗沙極多，白茅沙尤險，往來輪舶，須視江北狼山，及江南福山為準，此段江面，稱為狼福渡，刻江海關為利便夜航，在青大礁一帶水道，設置燈浮，嗣後上下水灑輪，均可畫夜通航，</p>
<p>學生遊行示威枝節</p>
<p>南通中等以上男女各校學生二千餘人，於二十三日晨，集合游行示威，十一時，行至省立南通中學校，要求該校學生，全體加入，與校長楊萃一發生衝突，致該校禮堂校長辦公處，敎導事務等處被搗毀，通中已向法院提起訴訟，</p>
<h3>杭州　南玉段年底决完成</h3>

<h3>蕭山　盜匪深夜綱刦魚塘</h3>
<p>蕭山東門外裘江鄉廟湖港，長約五里許，向係陳姓畜養魚鮮，每年繳捐納稅，目下年暮將屆，正擬捉捕之際，不料於二十二日夜間魚更三躍之時，突來强徒二三十人，明火執槍，大肆綱劫，該盜等四處開槍示威，故管魚人杜某，潛逃速避，該盜等約捕二小時之久，始挑抬魚鮮八千餘斤，向紹　呼嘯而去，該蕩主業已飛報縣府公安機關，請求追緝，</p>
<h3>人體之構造淺說及其功用　中央大學敎授孫宗彭　（續）</h3>
<p>（六）呼吸系統</p>
<p>呼吸系統之功用，乃呼出濁氣吸入新鮮空氣，以供給身體細胞所需要之養氣，鼻腔及口腔為呼吸之要道，肺為呼吸之重要器秋，與口腔通者，有喉頭與氣管，喉頭之內有聲帶，用以發音，喉頭與氣管皆為　骨所組成，氣管由喉頭沿頸而下，分二枝以入肺，每枝分為無數之小枝，各小枝再分而複分在枝之端，成為小氣胞，肺分左右二部，各部又分為若干小室，故肺呈海綿狀，有伸縮之動作，呼吸即藉此動作而行使之，氣管所分之二大枝即分入於肺之左右二部，其最小分之二大枝端之小氣胞，即位於肺之小室內，此乃吸入之氣與血液內氣體交換之處也，普通情形之下，所謂呼砐者，即除氮氣呼出吸入之量均等外，吸入之養氣多而炭氣少，而呼出者炭氣多而養氣少，故多吸新鮮空氣以有益於身體健康者，即此意也。</p>
<p>（七）排洩系統</p>
<p>排洩系統之主要器管為腎，左右各一，位於腹腔之背部，脊椎兩旁，為半月形，各有管通於膀胱，腎之構造在外者曰皮質部，在內者曰髓質部，皮質部中，滿佈馬氏囊，各囊有小管以通髓質部，馬氏襄為血液經過該部之過濾器，所過濾出之液體（尿）由小管流至髓質部面入輸尿管直歸膀胱，膀胱如一蓄水池，待一定時期，放入尿道而排洩於體外。</p>
<p>除此之外，排洩器管尚有皮膚，其所排洩之物，除氣體外，有汗及油，皆是腺體所排出者，淚亦屬排洩物，出自淚腺。</p>
<p>（八）生殖系統</p>
<p>生殖器官，有男女之別，男生殖器官，有精囊（睪丸）及與精囊相接之輸精管，貯精囊，攝護腺及陽莖，雄精在精囊內成熟後，即入輸精管，輸入貯精囊，同時囊之本體分泌一種黏液，或為保護及營業雄精之用，至需要時，則雄精經陽莖而射出。</p>
<p>女生殖器管，有卵巢及輸卵管，輸卵管與卵巢不直接相連，蓄卵成熟後，破巢而出，藉胞液之力冲入輸卵管，輸卵管之下部，曰子宮，通於外者曰陰道，卵離巢後，於卵巢上現有黃斑，曰卵黃體，具有內分泌之功用，如卵受精後，此卵黃體能抑制月經，及維持胎兒在子宮內發育，同時使乳頭發逹為哺乳之用，如卵無受精機會，則卵黃體漸漸退化。</p>
<p>（九）內分泌器管</p>
<p>內分泌，即一種特性之化學物質，由一定之器管所分泌，而入於血液以分佈於全體，能影響及其他器管之發育與生理，而對於個人之心理行為頗關重要，分泌　種物質者，曰內分泌器管，所分泌之物質，曰激動素，在解剖學上，頗少注意，而在生理上則頗重視，惟生理根基於解剖，故略述於下，就解剖上言之，內分泌器管，可分為無管腺及有管腺二大類，無管腺體有腦上腺，腦下腺，甲狀腺，副甲狀腺，胸腺，腎上腺及脾腺，俱具有內分泌者，僅腦下腺甲狀腺副甲狀腺及腎上腺，其餘者，則尚未證明有何功用，有管內分泌腺，有胰（膵）肝，雌雄性腺，其及附屬物體，茲就其重要者分別略述於後。</p>
<p>甲狀腺　位於喉頭之下，氣管兩旁左右各一，由一小帶狀物土腰所連繋，其形狀如盾，故又名盾狀腺，其所分泌之激動素含有碘質，影響於身體之發育甚大，若割去此腺，或此腺自然退化後，則身體發育不完全，毛髪呈脫落之現象，且皮膚乾燥，精神委靡散溫，動作呆笨，骨骼發育不全，性慾退化，智識不發逹等，終至死亡，若其分泌物質過多，則心跳加速，性燥，易受刺激，其甚者，有眼球突出，腺體長大頸腺腫等病症，此種疾病大槪女子較多於男子，可以醫治。</p>
<p>副甲狀腺　副甲狀腺位於甲狀腺內，左右各一對，形頗小而呈乳白色，其分泌之激動素影響於骨骼之鈣化頗大，其功用如維他命「提」及紫外光綫，此腺體若被割去，或自然退化後，則大多數不能生活，其輕者肌肉是呈疆直抽筋狀態，小孩發生之軟骨病，或因此項之激動素缺乏所致，而成人得此病者較少，得此病者，若施以副甲狀腺之激動素，或維他命「提」則可恢復健康，而紫外光綫亦收同等之功效。</p>
<p>腎上腺　腎上腺位於腎之上故名，內部分二層，曰皮質部，曰髓質部，二部之分泌質不相同，皮質部分泌「柯丁」，髓質部分泌腎上腺精（此係舊名），腎上腺精與交感神經同源，有興奮作用，刺激平滑肌之收縮，增加血壓，尚可刺激肝細胞增加液中之糖質，故患糖尿症者，如用膵腺激動素過量而使糖質過於减少，發生危險時，即用腎上腺精挽救之，「柯丁」為維持個體生命不可少之要素，如割去　腺體之髓質部尚不致死亡，而割去皮質部，則無一能生存者，輕者亦呈「愛迪生病」此腺關係於人體其他部分之發生者亦大，如皮膚之顏色及性慾之發育，亦與其他內分泌器管亦有相互共存之關係焉。</p>
<p>腦下腺　腦下腺位於腦下故名，分前後中三部，後部為神經組織所組成，其分泌之物質，以前學者頗注意，但據近來試騐結果，除增加血壓，收縮平滑肌外，無其他功用，中部位於前後部之間，其功用尚未證明，其前部為口內皮層所組成，近來頗引起生物學家及醫學家之注意，若被割去，則身體矮小性慾之器管不發育，但其日常生活則如常人，若其分泌過量，則反是，身體發育過於常人，手指口唇鼻等呈特殊之狀態，日久則成駝背，動作不敏，時感疲倦，腦下腺前部之分泌物質，近來約計有十四種之多，而實騐所證明者，僅數種而已，其最可靠者，為性之激動素，能刺激雌體內卵巢之發育，其他正在實騐中者，為長大之激動素，太生毛髪之激動素，餘則尚未聞有若何之報告焉。</p>
<p>膵腺　膵腺形狹長，中部　着於小腸，前後部則浮游於腸開膜中，除分泌消化酵素外，其內分泌物質，為膵激動素曰「英素輪」，與糖質代謝作用有密切之關係，若割去之，則肝臟失其形成肝粉之功用，而血液內糖質增加，則成糖尿症，故醫治糖尿症，即用膵腺激動素頗奏功效，與腎上腺精有相所之功用。</p>
<p>性腺　性腺分為雌雄二種，雄腺分泌雄性激動素，以刺激雄性器管及次性特徵，若被割去，則男子呈女子狀態，性情和悅，聲音尖銳，不生　，所謂雌雄反性之說即由於此，若年老精力衰弱者，可謂返老還童者即此說也。</p>
<p>分泌雌性激動素之器管，為卵巢及胎座等，雌性激動素有刺激卵巢及卵發育之功用，並調節經水，如腦下腺之性激動素，卵黃體之激動素，已如上述，卵刺激乳部之發育及維持胎兒停止經水等。</p>
<p>肝　肝臟位於腹腔之上部，為腺體之最大者，除司消化作用外，對於貧血有密切之關係，患貧血之人，食肝，或肝精均可增加紅血素及紅血細胞，因此之故，亦歸之內分泌。</p>
<p>內分泌之範圍極大，且極復雜，尚須努力推進焉。　（完）</p>

<h3>上海麵粉業概況（上海工商業概況之七）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>一，上海麵粉業之盛衰</p>
<p>我國舊式麵粉執法，係以石磨磨成，鄉間多由農人備磨自製，城鎮則有所謂磨坊。磨坊之性質係商店與手工工　之聯合體，大　備磨一二具或二三具，以牲口轉磨。此外鄉間又有所謂水磨者，即利用溪流之水力以轉動石磨，農人用之甚夥。惟各種舊式執法，皆遠遜於新式之機器執法，蓄其速率既緩，同時磨出之粉質亦甚粗雜也。故自洋粉及新式執法自海外侵入我國以來，其地位遂日趨衰落；水磨磨坊迄今雖尚有存在，然早已不若往日之重要　。</p>
<p>上海為全國上商業之樞紐，洋粉之輸入及新式製造廠家之出現，自以上海為最早。考外僑輸入洋粉之始，乃以接濟糧食為　，請於前清政府，免　進口關稅。至光緒二十二年，德商更來滬創立增裕麵粉公司（該廠與民十五收歇），直接在華製造，用小車　粉，勸人試用，是為我國境內新式麵粉製造業之　矢。至光緒二十四年，華商亦起而仿效，創立阜豐機器麵粉公司於上海，嗣後華商接種而起頗不乏人，今將歷年創立於上海一埠者列表如次：</p>
<p>成立時期　成立家數　附注</p>
<p>光緒二十二年至二十七年　二　——</p>
<p>光緒二十八年至三十二年　四　——</p>
<p>光緒三十三年至宣統三年　二　內有一家係改組而成</p>
<p>民元至民五　九</p>
<p>民六至民十　六　——</p>
<p>民十至民十五　四　內有三家係改組而成</p>
<p>民十六至民二十　一　——</p>
<p>民二十一至民二十四　〇　——</p>
<p>註：本表根據江蘇事業誌改製</p>
<p>由前表吾人可知上海新興民族麵粉業最發達之年代，為民元至民十之間，除改組者不計，完全新創者達十四家之多。此中最大之原因，即為歐洲大戰於民二爆發，延長五載，在此時期，因海運不便，且歐美各國軍需浩繁，食糧自給，尚堪不足，　論輸出，我國麵粉業遂勃然而起，造成該業之黃金時代。故自大戰休止以後，客觀情勢，遂即變換。新興之廠家已不多見，計自民十一至民廿十年間，完全新創者實際不過二家。同時衰落之象，亦於是時開端，如光緒三十年成立之裕豐，民元成立之大有，民三成立之信昌，民五成立之長豐，民七成立之元豐等廠，皆於民十五年前後宣告停業。民二十年自「九一八」之後，翌年，復有淞滬之役，同時國內外經濟恐慌，相繼襲來，上海麵粉業遂更不堪收拾。回憶當滬戰爆發之際，成立不及一年之吳淞麵粉廠，所有廠房機器，均遭焚毀，損失達二十萬元以上；位於潭子灣之中華豐記麵粉廠雖倖免於難，但流彈所及，損失亦達數萬。他如南市之申大，新　橋北之福新，光復路畔之裕通，曹家渡小沙渡之祥新立大等廠，非　戊卒，即貯軍火，雖未受槍砲之橫禍，而其所受之損失，亦復不小。至於因軍事關係，營業停滯所受之損失則難計算矣。近年來經濟恐慌，尚為恢復，人民購買力薄弱，益以捐稅之繁雜，上海麵粉業之宜告閉歇或停工者，時有所聞。如祥新昌記及海豐信記兩廠於去年五六兩月宣告清理，華豐興記及中華隆記兩廠於本年三月十月停工，而本月份內又有信大信記兩麵粉公司同時宣告閉歇，故麵粉業之前途，似未可樂觀也。</p>
<p>二，上海麵粉廠之實況</p>
<p>上海麵粉業為全國之冠，前已言之，據二十四年申報年鑑所載，其所佔之實際地位有如下表：</p>
<p>廠數　資本額　面年產量</p>
<p>上海　一二　六、〇八九、〇〇〇元　二九、七二〇〇〇〇袋</p>
<p>全國　六六　一四、五五二、〇〇〇元　六四、九六三〇〇〇袋</p>
<p>從前表觀察，全國機製麵粉廠五分之一以上全在上海，其資本額在上海者佔四分之一以上，每年麵粉產額上海更佔五分之二左右，此不僅足以證明上海麵粉廠所佔地位之重要，更能指示上海麵粉廠生產技術之進步，與生產規模之宏大，因其廠數僅佔五分之一，而其產量則佔五分之二也。</p>
<p>上海現存各廠之中，歷史最久者為阜豐，規模最大者為福新茂新，今將其組織情形及產銷狀況分述於次：</p>
<p>一，阜豐機器麵粉公司　廠址在本埠車袋角，於光緒二十四年創立，為股份有限公司，資本一百萬元，總經理為孫　　君。該廠機器設備有美國出品二十六部，英國出品五六十部，平均每年可出麵粉約八百五十萬包，麩皮九十六萬包，　號分紅藍自行車（即老車牌），綠砲台，鳳戲牡丹，綠雙魚，綠雙虎五種。老車牌行銷本埠最貴，平津粵一帶銷量亦大，　皮則分銷內地各處，其最近三年盈餘如下：二十一年二五八，二六七元，二十二年二五八，四四二元，二十三年三〇五，一七三元，尚有繼續增加之勢。閘北光復路之裕通阜記公司，亦為該廠所經營，係於民十五年端陽節，向已故富紳朱幼鴻租入。裕通今有資本五十萬元，經理為孫仲立，廠長為薛琴舟，廠中機器為美國出品，共二十四部，每年平均出粉十六萬四千包，出麩十八萬包，其牌號即沿用至阜豐之老車牌，銷路以天津為主，本埠次之。此外，滬　堆棧亦為阜豐公司所經營。（未完）</p>

<h3>一九三五—三六籃球新規則　對於籃球訓練上之影響（上）</h3>
<p>— 美國魯比著　錢一勤譯</p>
<p>籃球新規則、對於敎練員、將有若何之影響乎、現今不頗著成效之進攻方法、或因規則之更改、而失其效用乎、何種攻守戰略、勢將獲得成功乎、凡此種種問題、均由意利諾大學多年之首席敎練員魯比氏J．Craig　Ruby　答覆如後—譯者、</p>
<p>今年五月間、在全美籃球教練員聯合會舉行大會時、紐約巿立大學之和爾門氏Nat　Hol＇會報告美國東方各州裁判最大困難、為當球尚未傳至樞紐地位之際、樞紐球員與對方守衛球員不斷之爭掠位置、有時此種爭掠位置之舉動、形同摔角比賽、聯合會曾通過和邇和氏之提議、—即對於進攻方面樞紐球員三秒鐘限制一條規則、不論當其持球在手或未持球在手、均屬有效、—建議於全美籃球委員會、（按、該委員會即每年修改籃球規則最高之組織、吾國之規則、悉根據於此、）該委員會已將此項提議、併入一九三五—三六年之規則內、</p>
<p>此項新規則之要意、為「當比賽進行之際、其同隊之球員管束或獲得球時、一球員不論其持球與否、均不得在罰球區域內、留待三秒鐘以上、當其一隊之球員與另一球員互相傳遞之時、球即屬被其一隊之管束、」（註一）此當然係指當一進攻方面之球員、趨入其罰球區域內、三秒鐘之計數終隨即開始、若其接球及運球遞、亦必於一秒鐘限制內奔出區域之外、否則其一隊即將失去有球而判出界、若其接球後立即投籃、則三秒鐘之計數終止、因其一隊已不能管束球矣、當球自板上反躍之際、彼此任意留連於該區域以內、</p>
<p>此項規則、對於比賽之影響至巨、從今以後將不獲復睹魁偉之球員、預立於罰球區域之內、憑藉其身長與伸遠以及與守衛之爭掠、而得隨時接球無阻之機會矣、今後倘仍欲應用簡單樞紐式之進攻、則任樞紐之球員、必需有良善之脚步工夫、與夫適洽之時計、方可接球無阻、第一圖為一種樞紐球員適用之行動方式、當四號運球前進之際、樞紐球員一號直向前奔越過區域、旋反身假作奔回、隨即轉向左方前進、算準時計接二號之傅球、蓋先時二號業已接得四號傅來之球也、在一號傅球給二號（或四號）之後、彼必須迅速奔出罰球區域以外、否遇三秒鐘之規則、將使其一隊失去有球之權、若二號如圖所示接球後、亦必須於三秒鐘內奔出區域以外、</p>
<p>許多教練員發問關於一號球員、倘取一足立於區綫外、同時另一足立於區域內、而每隔一二秒鏡時間、將區域內之一足舉起、藉免三秒鐘之規定、是否合法、或問一號球員、用一足在區綫以外、一足在區內跨行、或跑入罰球圈內、是否所有時間均認為三秒鏡之計算內、規則上之解釋如後、「當甲隊得球時、甲一之一足立於區域內、彼旋轉之際、以致完全立於區域以外、終又轉回區域內、按照規則—若此全部動作　時三秒鐘以上、則為違例、」（註二）故就以上情形而言為不合法、</p>
<p>因三秒鐘規則、足以影響樞紐球員之進攻方法、故防守彼之守衛、亦必改變方略、或者第一圖中防守一號之守衛、將採取足以阻礙一號行動之地位、勢必使一號球員、發展眞實之脚下工夫、與夫適洽之時計、或者此項新規則、僅將一號與其守衛之爭掠位置、由罰球區域內移至區域外之旁邊、果眞若是、則此項規則、斷難逹到其原來目的、</p>
<p>假定此種簡單樞紐進攻式在此項新規則實施之下、仍可應用自如、至少有兩種現行著名之進攻</p>
<p>第一图</p>
<p>方法、必受淘汰、第二圖示一種有名之前鋒在樞紐球員前之交換進攻法、四號傅球與一號、三號穿過一號前面時、一號假作將球傅與之、而實則傅給其次穿過其前面之二號、由屢次試騐所得、自一號進入區域內直至其傅給二號及其自己奔出區域外、或俟二號投籃為止、共需時間三秒鐘以上、</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（三）（四）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>南恩於是急急轉回身去、重將自己縛了起來、開始起勁縫着。不久羅勃也來了、看見那種新的罰法覺得有趣、所以他拿了一根跳繩、自己繋縛在蘇乏的另一個脚上、倒是難得有這麽要好這麽體貼的人呢。</p>
<p>「我也走失了的、所以我也應該和南恩一樣處罰、」他解釋給他的母親聽、當她發見了那個新罪犯。</p>
<p>「我怕你是要得到一些罰、因為你知道離開了別的人跑得很遠是不對的。」</p>
<p>「南恩同我去的、」羅勃道、他雖然願嘗味那種新刑罰、却不願去分謗。</p>
<p>「你本不必去。你自有知覺、雖然你還是個小童子、你得要常常注意、聽你知覺或良心的指揮。所以你得停留在這裏、到吃午餐的時候、同時和南恩討論討論。我相信你們兩人非等到我的命令不會自己去解縛的。」</p>

<p>一大堆穢物</p>
<p>部定衛生運動日期，為五月十五，十二月十五兩次，是日各地黨政機關，聯合民衆，舉行大掃除，還要按家插戶施行淸潔檢查，各學校復有衛生宜傳隊之組織，宜乎一切穢物，掃除一空，家家戶戶，另有一種新氣象了。那知事實勝雄辯，事竟有大謬不然者，於此，不禁聯想到去年中委吳稚暉先生在江蘇省立醫政學院演講「公共衛生建設之急迫」的幾句話了。他老先生設「破蓆子塞在門角落裹，做壁虱的老巢，馬桶破了蓋，放在牀下展覽，火腿吃完了，栓火腿的繩子還高高掛着，給蜘蛛去結網，桌子底下，凳子邊上，盡變成破鞋的陳列所，假使按家檢查一下，准可發現一大堆穢物。」侃侃道來，不啻為一般家庭中寫景，節錄於此，以促施行淸潔檢查者之特別注意。</p>
<h3>冬的風景綫</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>冬季裏的太陽，老是那麼淡淡的放着像昏睡也似的光芒。枯黑的樹幹，迎着怒吼着的時季風，發出堅强抵抗的掙扎聲。一葉，二葉，留戀在樹頭上的殘葉，悠悠地跟着風兒，脫離了樹頭，投向東南去。在風中打着轉，在大地上打着轉，很不幸地淪入了匐伏在地上的不幸的一羣的同一的命運裏，供人類，畜類，甚至於虫類的無情的踐踏。不幸呀，有的更墮落到了山谷中，溪流中，或是其他不可思議的所在，而得到永被人們所遺忘掉的悲哀，寂寞的歸宿。</p>
<p>雨在冬季裹，老是比了太陽光，更高與地光顧到入間。冬季裹的雨，永久是像綫那麼的下着。整天，是像籠罩在夜幕裹。農村中，沒有雞鳴聲，沒有狗吠聲，也沒有孩子們的叫囂聲，也沒有大入們的歡笑聲，所有的，只是一片像死一般的沉寂。在雨幕中的山，在雨幕中的樹，石橋，房屋，都是靜靜地站着，站在像死一般的沉寂的空氣裏。有時，在雨絲中覓食而迷途的小烏兒，啁啾着衝破了沉寂，但是很短暫的，像死一般的沉寂，又征服了宇宙間的一切。</p>
<p>在都市裏，沒有夏，可是也沒有冬。一九三六年式的汽車，老是瘋狂也似的在平坦的柏油路上，在醉人的霓虹燈光中，那麼滑溜地淌着。姑娘們是忘掉了季節了，裏在外衣中的，還是赤裸着的胸，赤裸着的腿臂。不錯，在姑娘們的臉上，永久是浮着春一般的笑意。大减價的旗招上，大减價的標語上，都淡淡地點綴上了一個「冬」字。可是冬的威嚴，是永久敵不過象牙之宮裹的電爐和水汀的。</p>
<p>嗯，冬，雖然永久攻不進象牙之宮，但是在天堂之外，儘有的是同在這個人世之間的地獄。大飯店裹面是一團春意，隔着一層兒玻璃，便充滿了號寒啼饑的慘呼。不，還有半個身子漂在洪水裹，生命像一葉，二葉，留戀在樹頭上的殘葉也似的災民咧。</p>
<p>甚麼東西，都掉在死一般的氣氛裏，除了都市中的象牙之宮。—這麼着，便有力地顯示着一幅冬的畫面。</p>
<h3>馬桶</h3>
<p>— 馮摩尼</p>
<p>一個入固然不能不吃飯，因為沒飯吃，就不得活命，但是；吃了飯之後，一定要拉屎，如果只吃不拉屎，對於身體有關，也是不能活命的，所以無論是誰，飯總要吃的，而且也免不了拉屎的麻煩。</p>
<h3>何苦自陷</h3>
<p>因為吃了東西就要拉屎，馬桶這束西當然是必不可少的；然而社會上許多人，光是為了吃飯問題而恐慌，沒一個為拉屎而發急的，也許是吃了之後，才能拉屎的綠故。</p>
<p>據說：以前男子或是女子拉屎，全是在街坊上的糞坑裏拉的，然而女子上糞坑，未免有些那個，後來總算想出一個圓凳似的馬桶來，旣雅觀，又舒適，更不必跑來跑去；不過這馬桶給女入用的，可是男子們見了這馬桶，也不願意上糞坑去拉屎，因為在坑上搭起臭架子，非常的脚酸，於是也上馬桶，直到現在，除了半途內急而上坑之外，其餘全用馬桶了。</p>
<p>但是有些人，坐上了馬桶，就不肯站起來，甚至多坐一刻好一刻，坐着看看報，呼呼香烟，的確是別有風味，也有人坐上幾個鐘點，覺得越坐越有趣，究竟什麼味兒，只有歡喜坐馬桶的朋友自己知道。</p>
<p>一個人是貪心不足的，有了這舒適不過的馬桶，還是不大滿意，於是要用抽水馬桶，拉屎之後，旣無奧味，又不見穢污的糞汁，但是：抽水馬桶近乎貴族化，除了有錢人享用外，其餘還是用這平民化的馬桶。</p>
<p>我還記得小時候在私塾裏謮書，如果默不出書來，那老師閣王似的臉孔，眞够怕人，於是都借拉屎為名，坐在馬桶上偷看書本，那末不致受着老師的訓斥了。</p>
<p>臭氣滿佈的為桶間，而能給許多學生便利，我不禁嘆曰，馬桶之功用，誠大矣哉。</p>
<h3>讀山海經</h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>翻巴蛇圖，語極荒唐，事有類此。因懷家國，不知涕泗之何從！緊以長句，略募泉明，然而遣情誌忿，意有異已。海閣霜瞪物物幽，鴻荒圖說注淸眸；奇哀結舌蛇吞象，故事傷心鵲讓鳩！六道何曾關刧數，諸天原不講恩仇：人間別有荒唐痛，無處安排壯士頭。</p>

<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣妹集議虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>北海遠遠的望着，已經看到賈多才的臉上，變了顏色，也不解什麼綠故，好像這和自己出了一口很大的悶氣，不由得心裏，大大痛快了一陣。這些太太們進房以後，就聽到喞喞呱呱，亂吵了一陣。最後有一個人叫道：我們不必亂，還是讓劉太太和賈先生先說罷。劉太太的話，若是有要補充的時候，我們再來補充幾句就是了。這就聽到　太太道：賈先生，我現在單刀直入的和你談幾句。我們這些同志們，以為你花一百五十塊錢，買一個女人來當奴隸，　不是現代社會上能容忍的事。賈多才道：各位到現在怎麼還不明白，我是娶他作女入，並不是買他作了頭。劉太太道：你娶作女八，在那裹結婚的？你家裹還有太太沒有？買多才道：　是娶　作側室。要結什麼婚呢？劉太太道：什麼叫側室，我們不　。賈多才道：我就說明白了罷，　是娶他作姨太太。你們以為這就是　的錯。可是　　娶姨太太的人，那就太多了，難道就是我姓賈的一個人娶姨太太就犯法嗎？只　　句姨太太小要緊，立刻碎碎拍拍桌子椅子茶杯茶壶，嚮成了一片。同時便聽到那些太大們亂叫起來。賈多才嚇得向外直跑，口裏喊道：你們只管打只管　，　壞了東西，怕你們不賠。哼！說看話，人已是跑到房門外過廳粵站着。　些女太太們，早日三四位跟了出來，將包包圍着。賈多才向大家望着，出道：你們道理不講道理？你們在屋子裏和我　交涉，我讓了出來，　經是表示退步了，你們怎　父追到外而來？劉太太屋了輿招　手道：你只管進來，話說不　，還有個商量，你躲開來就能了事嗎？（三八三）</p>

<h3>聖誕老人帶給孩子們的禮物</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>每年的十二月二十五日，聖誕老人照例的總要帶些禮物來送給孩子們的；但是今年却有點不同，他知道今年是兒　年，道份禮物非但應該隆重些，而且更不能像往年一樣，只是將一些吃的玩的淺薄禮品來騙騙孩子們了，至少也得揀有意義點的東西來贈給他們。</p>
<p>他今天一早就起了身，看看天氣倒還淸朗，可是西北風却吹得着實有點兒緊：於是他戴上了那個大紅風兜，把那襲半新舊的大紅呢皮襖束得史緊了點，挾了一個紅布包袱，大步　路出了自己的家門，向着那世界大市塲走去。</p>
<p>「買些什麼禮物來送給他們才合式呢？不用吃的玩的，那來得揀些切合實際的，適應時代的……」他是一位慈祥的老者，所以處處總在爲世界上的許多可愛的孩子們打算，他想使得那些孩予每個都有幸福，而且也常常為一些沒在幸禮的可憐孩子不牛，但是他沒法能够使他們一樣有幸福！</p>
<p>老八一路走一路想，但想不出應該買些什麼禮物，要有益於孩干，並且每個孩子都需要的一脚走進了世界市塲里那家最大的百貨商店，—世界百貨大商店—睜開眼來看看，覺得情形有點悽慘—首先觸進他眼廉的是一些燬滅世界，屠殺人類的武器—槍，砲，飛機，兵艦，炸彈，坦克車，以及許多他從未見過的科學化學的新發明傢伙，總之他也呌不出這些是什麼東西；不過在櫃台口掛着的各種假面具他還認識，可是上面却寫明專給大人用的，已不是孩子們戴的玩意兒了。</p>
<p>他一處一處的看着，看見這些東西全不配做今天給孩子們的禮物；於是他又向最後的一隻櫃台上去找了。這裹面很冷落，只有幾個像患着頹廢病的店員伏在櫃台上，顧客却沒有一個，陳列着的幾種貨品如敎育，人格，努力，奮鬥，智識，勇敢，忠實，常識，衛生，運動等，但已積滿了塵埃，彷彿好久沒有整理過了。他走過去看了一回，覺得這些就是他心裹要想送給孩子們的禮物，他拿起一件來吹去了灰塵，仔細地看着；而那兩個店員却仍舊冷冷的，好像笑他今天買道東西去當禮物是落伍的。然而他終於每樣都貿了，而且竟買了一大包。</p>
<p>聖誕老人揹了一大包的禮物，興忽忽的走出了世界百貨大商店的門，迎着猛烈的西北風走上了歸途，預備一樑一樣地來分贈給那些可愛的孩子們……</p>
<p>他走在路上，也彷彿看見了一羣小天使的笑臉！</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （揚子江）</p>
<p>有一次，我經過淨安寺，督見兩個丐　在向人行道上的西洋紳士討錢·兩個丐　是一男一女，大約都已經有十四五歲了·嘴裏不住的喊：</p>
<p>「大老爺，大老爺，做做好事！」</p>
<p>乞丐在東西洋各國也都是有的，所以不足為奇·不過向洋大人稱大老爺，却實在不必。據最近舉行的老上海展覽會揭示出來說：在前淸，外人稱中國官長必曰「大人」，自稱必曰「夷民」·現在的情形恰正相反，殖民地奴隸總是野　的，所以「夷民」倒是我們自己。從前自稱「夷民」的，月下已被人尊稱為洋大人了，</p>
<p>聽到丐童之稱西人為大老爺，我不禁感慨係之。</p>

<h3>聖誕節要求意阿停戰</h3>
<p>— 方殷</p>
<p>據哈瓦斯羅馬敎京十九日電：「敎廷擬仿照南美洲玻璃維亞與巴拉圭戰爭時之辦法，要求意阿兩國在耶穌誕節日停止戰爭。但能否辦到，殊可懷疑。關於此事，敎廷雖曾向意國政府迭决洽商，惟因近日非洲前綫形勢發展之故，戰事未見有停頓之可能；而短時期內，恐卽將發生大規模鏖戰云。」</p>
<p>據說宗敎多是善心的，所以對於一切無人道的殺戮，虐待，或慘酷的戰爭行為，都在反對及阻北之列，故不久之前，曾聞市上有所謂「世界和平祈禱會」之股。但是一看到宗敎家的行徑時，事實上郤又頗使我輩懷疑了，因歷史上旣有過「十字軍」的東征，而最近又有以從羅馬聖城出發的對阿比西尼亞的撻伐。而且，他們所謂祈禱和平，在帝國主義者正劍援弩張的今日，究能於事實何補？……</p>
<p>這决羅馬敎廷要求意阿兩國停戰，旣非為了維持和平，也並沒有說明他們是要支持宗敎家底人道主義，單純的是為了點綴耶穌的誕辰，希圖使聖誕節不至在撕殺喧天和火藥氣中度過，這眞可說宗敎家底最率眞的面容：耶穌是慈愛（？）的，所以在耶穌誔日的確不該有煞風景的殺人戰爭，何況還可以援引巴玻戰爭與漢志　門的戰爭會履行此類要求爲例？　且不管意阿當局答應　要求與否，而　　敎廷之享受此　神聖的權利；到底總該是無　的。</p>
<h3>捐</h3>
<p>— 姚英</p>
<p>我正在盤算陽暦年關的應付，小鈴的脚步急怱怱地奔到我的床邊，揭開了我的帳子，右手已搶着被角，用力地一拖，等不及我的問話，他已開口了：</p>
<p>「爸爸！爸爸！明天學堂裹放學，林牧師關照要捐，隨便幾個鈿，今天要交給校長的，爸爸！是給窮人家小囝買白相干（玩物），看影戲的，先生還話過，哈人捐得多，得第一名，爸爸！您捐兩只洋好哦！爸爸！爸爸！」我一時模不着頭緒；不多幾天，會捐過一塊錢的水災費，什麼又要捐了？</p>
<p>「那，那那，林牧師來演說，敎我們問爸爸捐，捐給那苦來些的小囝，沒有衣裳着的，吃亦沒有吃的，捐銅錢給他們去買白相午，還要請他們看影戲呢。爸爸！林牧師是一個有鬍鬚的老老頭，待我們交關（很）好，昨天來帶了交關糖，每人一包。還叫我們是小朋友，滑稽得來。」小鈴嘻開着嘴，那種天眞的流露，使我沒有勇氣拒絕他了。</p>
<p>「小鈴，好好，明天拿去。」我打算另想辦法，不要使他感到不快。</p>
<p>「爸！今天要的，明天放學。」一邊對媽說：「媽！爸爸！洋鈿不給我。」「你就給了他吧！昨夜已經繼了一個黃昏了，我是沒有一個錢。」</p>
<p>「皮夾裹去看看看。」我喉間好像被什麼鯁着般的吐出了這句話，她亦懶懒地走到檯邊，去取皮夾，撥去鈕扣，傾瀉而出一塊銀幣，二個角子，倒在檯上，小鈴念跑過去拿在手裹，又向着我道：「爸爸，還要一塊。」</p>
<p>「小鈴，拿仔一塊好了，學堂裏向，橫捐堅捐，捐不淸爽。」被母親責駡了幾句，小鈴悻悻地走了。孩子心裏沒有滿足，我是知道的，但是怎樣可以去滿足他的慾望呢？我的視綫被牆壁上的日歷攫住了，年關已經近在目前了　！</p>

<h3>狗</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>如果有路人問詢到朱鄉董家的路由，在告訴了他過了護莊河橋，有一所黑漆牆門之後，從沒有漏去門前有一頭石獅子那末高大的黑狗。黑狗是朱鄉董家的記號，牠終日盤踞在黑牆門外的照牆下，一雙碧藍的狗眼炯炯地打量着每一個在護莊僑上來往的路客。有熟客來拜訪鄉董，那頭黑狗早已伶俐地躥進牆門告訴那位朱家三代的老門公了。老門公終年患着咳嗽症，他靠着三代老家人的歷史在朱公館裏吃這碗現成飯。那頭黑狗本來是少爺養着行獵用的，但是為了佃戶起見，牠就兼職了老門公的助手，所以老門公愛護牠更甚於少爺。</p>
<p>那頭黑狗據說是狼種，有着狼形的頭，聳直的耳朶，壯健的腿，晚上護莊橋吊起之後，牠可以在兩丈寬的河面上躥來躥去。買價是白銀三百兩，當初在這鄉鎭上傅為美談的。那狗的食量更是驚人，一天要五升白米，五斤牛肉，有一個叫阿根的小厮專司共職。那頭黑狗旣有着這樣偉大的歷史，更破過一件駭人的奇案，就是牠躥上屋頂捕獲過一個强盜。所以提起朱鄉董，就沒有人敢漏去那頭黑狗的。</p>
<p>今年秋天，有一次少爺行獵歸來，那頭黑狗忽然失蹤了。小厮阿根幾乎二天沒有吃飯睡覺，到附近鄉鎭找尋。後來有個老頭送到朱公館門上，說是那頭黑狗在他家牛欄裏睡着。少爺重黨了那位老頭之後，他吩咐阿根把那頭黑狗用鐵鏈鎖起來。行獵時候也不帶那頭狗了。但是那黑狗見少爺出門，總叫着，噑着縱跳起來有一人那末高，那條鐵鏈就像要斷了似的。朱鄉董是頗重迷信的，他以為將有什麽不吉利的事情發生，打獵時候還是帶着出去，或者竟是停止打獵，讓牠安穩穩在照牆下守門吧。之變了性。但是少爺沒有聽老子的話！</p>
<p>「爸爸，你放心罷。那頭狗也是太靈敏了，牠可以在數里以外嗅着我的行蹝，牠每天跟着我到處亂跑，現在一旦鎖起來，自然一知道我要出門，就叫着跳着了。不過要是再像上回似的失蹤了，幾百兩銀子不必說，一時倒買不到這樣的好狗呢。」</p>
<p>爸爸是愛兒子的，自然是不再注意到狗的身上；而况爸爸是有着爸爸的事情呢。少爺依然每天出門打獵，可是特別叮囑小厮阿根提防那頭黑狗。那條狗白天就銷在石獅子邊旁，晚上鎖在阿根的房裏。老門公自然咕嚕着，因為他是愛那頭狗的，並且那頭狗鎖了之後，聽見牠在長門外高喊的時候他就要扶着手杖從門房裏出來，恐怕有拜訪鄉董的貴客駕臨。</p>
<p>雖然這樣嚴密地提防着牠，一天上午牠咬斷了鐵鏈又失蹤了，而那位出門打獵去的少爺下半天却被人打傷了抬回來，那頭狗垂頭喪氣地跟在後面。</p>
<p>旣然是朱鄉董家裏的事，第二天這件新聞就傳遍了全鎭。</p>
<p>原來少爺在鄰鎭上霸佔了一個有夫之婦，那天那黑狗在婦人家的竹籬邊高聲嘷叫，引動了四鄰的注意，因此發現了少爺的姦情，被他們痛打了一頓。</p>
<p>朱鄉董雖然馬上喊地保來化了一筆錢，但是新聞已像風一樣地到處傅佈着。朱鄉董因此遷怒到黑狗身上，把牠縛了石塊沉在護莊河裏，而那小厮阿根也連帶着敲破了飯碗。</p>
<h3>麻雀</h3>
<p>— 曼因</p>
<p>院子里有株不知名的常綠樹，是多年的老樹了。今年修葺井院，家人因為牠不能開花結實，又是樣子不很雅觀，（像一個駝背的老人那樣蜷伏在墻角里，而有一枝巨大似的枒幹飛來峰的高出在墻外。）已經命令匠工誅代了，我是頗愛花木的，雖然自己從未扦過一支花，或翻過一個盆，但是很希望院子里終年花卉奔放；然而一到冬令，院子里像寂寞的墓地一樣，曾經欣欣向榮的各種花草，都被搬進花房去了，祇有那株不很雅觀的常綠樹獨自在寒風中頑固地生存着。在冬天，能看到一點蒼翠的綠色，可以消滌像灰暗的日子那樣憂鬱的，我所對把那株常綠樹代去，於是變通地伐去了那支畸形的巨幹，讓牠蜷伏在墻角里。就在那時候，我發現了一個麻雀窩安穏地築在濃密的樹葉之間。相傅鳩鵲的巢穴，而麻雀更是懦弱的匿居在人家的屋檐下，或是古寺荒塔的瓦磚之中。在那株常綠樹上的麻雀窩雖遠不及燕巢那樣整潔，精緻，牠祗是收集一點敗葉殘枝在樹枝的交叉點架了個雛形。但我認為是個奇蹟。自從我發現了這秘密，我每天站在窗前，一個哲學研究者那樣去考察在院子里及屋頂上跳躍着那羣麻雀，費了許多時日，我沒有發現那羣麻雀的特異之處，牠們嬉戲終日，在我家的鷄塒四週偷竊一點食料。也曾幾次去探望牠們的巢穴，終始不見修葺完整，那些敗葉殘枝却漸漸地腐爛了，那個雛形的巢穴幾利祗是那樹枝支等着。我的研究失敗之後，就不復加以注意了。最近風雪交加，吹折了一支樹枝，麻雀窩帶着傾覆，那羣麻雀都避到窗前來，牠們戰慄着，啁啾着，仿佛一羣難民一樣。一日夜之後，有幾頭竟是僵死了，沒有死的還是戰慄着，啁啾着。弟弟把牠們一一捉在鳥籠里，食以米粟，飲以清水，掛到屋子里來沒有半天，牠們恢復了常態，在籠子裏跳躍為戲了；牠們忘了冬天的可怕，忘了覆巢之痛，或許竟是歌頌着現在的安樂之所的鳥籠呢</p>
<p>小學敎科書中有一則蜜蜂和麻雀的寓言：一個冬天，麻雀向密封借糧，蜜蜂回答牠：「你春天遊戲，夏天遊戲，秋天遊戲，我的糧食是預備自己過冬的。」麻雀是懶惰，因循，我先前以為牠能够築巢是我的錯誤，牠旣不能像鳩那樣地去侵佔喜鵲的巢穴，又不能防患於未然，屯積冬天的糧食，及至覆巢之後，苟安於人家屋檐之下，還是不免於凍死，那末，這目前的鳥籠，牠們自然作為安樂窩了。（冬天隨筆之二）</p>

<p>湘江浪里憶我君</p>
<p>當時我醉美人家，美人顏色嬌如花，今日美人棄我去，青樓珠箔天之涯，娟之嫦娥月，三五二八盈又缺。翠眉蟬　生別離，一望不見心斷絕，心斷絕，覺來淚滴湘江水，湘江兩岸花木深，美人不見愁人心，含愁更奏綠綺琴，調高弦絕無知音，美人兮美人，不知為暮雨，為朝雲，想思一夜梅花發忽到　　疑是君。</p>
<p>當時　泊在海外，美人容貌艷如花，此刻還家見美人，人去樓空淚雨　，婷婷玉人去，呌我如何不想她？淡白衣袖多清秀，一去不回沒奈何，沒奈何，憶君猶醉意，帶悲更歌白頭吟，調寄琴里告知音，美人兮美人，不知為暮雨，為朝雲，想思一夜深夢長，湘江浪里憶我君。</p>

<h3>亞令配克車展中汽車設計的新趨勢</h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>這一次亞令配克車展中，參加的車廠凡五十九，內中英國的佔三十，美佔十五，其餘十四則係歐洲大陸，各個汽車式樣的新奇，引擎效率的高超，和行駛的安全，實在是令人感到很深切的滿意，也是歷屆展覽中未有的成績，而値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>車身流綫的設計，現在已入了有規則的狀態，從前狂放的車式，在展覽會中已很難尋到，因為一般工程師對於空氣阻力已作進一步的研究，阻力系數的價値，已有新的確定，所以車身任何部分之流線設計，比較已精確多，並且現在特別的考慮車廂的體積，求比例的適當，完全與昔日單方面的流綫化不同。</p>
<p>全鋼的車頂，在從前是最時髦不過的，但現在已漸漸被鋁合金製的替代這種新車頂不但美觀，並且質最輕極，可以减少車身的載重，同時比較經濟，更可省去外部飾漆的費用。</p>
<p>獨立彈簧在不久的過去，受着很多工程師的誹議，但是最近已完全成功，在這次展覽會中，美國和大陸陳列的汽車中有百分之六十六的車輛沒有前輪軸，英國汽車恐怕還有更大的百分數，在這種汽車上，前輪是用半徑臂和橫彈簧所支持，二輪不相連附，這樣一來，車身重力的分播，格外來得平均，行駛時的振動，差不多完全避免，並且修理也比較容易得多。</p>
<p>車身的骨骼的重量已漸漸的在减輕，因為堅强而靈巧的特製鋼骨，已漸漸的在採用，整塊的車底，現在已翻砂成功，這實在是汽車史上未有的新紀錄，不過因為成本太昂，尚未能普遍採用，目前大半車身的　接，須皆採用電　，其强度有幾倍於舊法的鉚釘接法，所以在現在的新式車骨上，差不多尋不出接頭的地方。</p>
<p>引擎的設計，現在大部份根據飛機引擎的動作，考慮更來得週密，每哩的用油量已减至最小，活塞行動距離，已漸漸的加增，使馬力擴大，因為每分鐘引擎轉數的增加，散熱器的工作，格外來得重要，最新式的空氣和水流散熱器，已採用成功，在從前的引擎上，換檔後（卽更換速率後）每不能輸送聞高的能力，使大半損失，這實在是最不經濟的一件事，現在已把齒輪箱設計更變，損失减去不少。</p>
<p>新車上最令人滿意的地方，就是利用水力自動地調節汽門機件的空隙，這足以使行車更安全而更經濟，這種的新裝置，設計時不是容易的，實在是全體工程師合力研究的結果，散熱器和拐軸箱已採用整塊翻沙，使動作格外靈敏，引擎各部的潤滑制，差不多完全採用自動，各部的注油地帶，更來得精確和有效，這都足以促進引擎的良好工作。</p>
<p>能力傅遞的變換，將更來得容易，現在已有更新的齒輪制發明「赫德森」車上的「雷手」有着驚人的成績，在這制度裏面，速率的更換，完全用電流和眞空的作用，應用時祗須手按電紐，卽可得需要的動作，便利已極。</p>
<p>車廂的設計，現在已漸漸的委之專門的工程師（與車身設計分里），安適和藝術化，將有一輛四周都是玻窗的新車陳列，這種汽車的優點，在使車廂裏的人便於瞭望，賞識風景，特別在效外駛行的時候。</p>
<p>引擎的位置，將更在車身的前部，同時車身的尾部更來得伸出，車底離地更近，使車廂的地位更來得寬舒，這一切的一切，都足以增加行駛的安適和滿意。</p>
<p>在這次車展裏面，依照成績看來，英國的汽車，恐怕佔着最優勢，其中例如「喜臨門」和「亨白」等車，設計的精美，構造的優良，在在給人以深刻的印象，其他如「愛而維司」，「台姆而安」等等，都玲瓏敏捷，洵屬佳構，美國新車中進步最速的，當然要推「福特」，不過年來各車廠競爭努力，設計上和構造上都有更迅速的進步，在這次展覽會中，必有驚人的成績啊。</p>
<h3>美國汽車肇禍統計</h3>
<p>一九三四傷人三萬六千　一九三五全年將有四萬</p>
<p>不久之前。在本刋上有過一篇譯述英國汽車肇禍統計的文章。不過有的地方。把英國的紀錄來對比的。據官塲方面統計的結果。一九三四年度。全美各地。被汽車輾斃的人是三萬六千。至於本年度。準確的統計。雖然還沒有。但很多人以為將增加到四萬人。因為汽車肇禍的紀錄。近幾月來。在疾速的增高起來。神經過敏的人。便以為這種情形。足以反正汽車事業的不景氣象。將要過去了。因為在經濟危機最盛的時候。美國境內。至少有三四百萬輛汽車。為了車主沒有錢買汽油而擱置在停車室內。這些汽車。不但現在都在開駛了。而旦在增告行車的哩程。另外有兩個增加肇禍紀錄的原因。便是速度的加快。而自酒禁解放以來。有很多吃酒醉的人駕駛車輛。據統計專家所說。美國的汽車肇禍紀錄。事實上並不十分高。就一九三二年統計所得。在美國。每一〇〇〇·〇〇〇人中被汽車輾斃的是二一·九人。而英國那一年是九·九人。不過我們要知道。汽車的數量。美國五·二五人中平均有一輛。而英國二五人中衹有車一輛。</p>
<p>汽車肇禍而後。致人死命的紀錄。所以增加。雖然因汽車的運用者。日見加多所致。但在比率上。恐怕是遠遠超過的。一九三三和一九三四兩年之中。美國的汽車。所耗汽油。增加百分之七。但致命的肇禍案件。却增加了百分之一三。在歷史上。這個紀錄。是最高的了。紀錄的增加。郊外比城巿中差得多也。許城巿居民。不拘行人或司機人。關於避禍方面。受到不少敎訓。行路駛車。都謹愼的防備着。最普通的禍患。是兩部汽車互相衝撞。佔肇禍總數百分之四三·三。其次是汽車和行人相撞。佔百分之三八·三。這也許是出人意料的，凡是不關衝撞的肇禍案件。祇有百分之五·三。生命的喪失。兩車相撞比人車相撞少得多。前者祇佔百分之二三·八。而後者有百分之四四·三。一九三四年一年之中。全美人士。為汽車所傷而並不致命者。總共九五四·〇〇〇人。這此肇禍案件之中。雖包括酗酒肇禍者。紀錄在日見增加之中。但我們不能說酒醉是增加汽車肇禍的重要原因。為了在汽車肇禍案件中。駛機人或行人因酒誤事的。祇用百分之五至十。在這個比數上。我們委實不能指明酒醉是增加肇禍紀錄的重要因素呢。</p>
<p>近年以來。美國方面。有若干城巿。從敎育方面入手。以减少車輛的肇禍紀錄。結果已得到相當的成效。因為在全國紀錄增加聲中。那些城巿。却在低减。就以加利佛尼亞州的舊金山說。在全國增加百分之一三的致命案件期內。那邊却增低百分之一五。賓塞爾瓦尼亞州畢斯堡地方。在同時期中。增低百分之十三。最近美國方面。為求减低肇禍紀錄起見。採用每年至少把街巿上所有汽車。檢查一次的方法。塞車。前照燈。以及其他各機件。都須檢查一過。如果發現了有弊病。立刻要着車主去修理。以求行車的安全。有若干城巿之中。這一區的警察。和另一區警察。相互競爭。維持交通秩序的結果。那一區的肇禍紀錄來得低。每星期或每月統計一次。成績好的。由當局獎勵。這樣一來。警察對於肇禍的司機人。都當做寃家。而在可能範圍以骨。都想設法防止汽車的肇禍。有的地方。年青的人們。在高等學校裏面。正式有汽車駕駛一科。以資實習。為了在美國。所有的孩子。到了十二三歲。已大都知道駕駛汽車的方法。所以那時事實上他們早已會駕車了。不過不良的習慣。就在學校中加以指正。並敎以內燃引擎的各種發動原理。</p>
<p>美國各地。目前還有一個很大的缺點。就在全國沒有一處統一的交通規則。一切行車法規。都由各州自訂。道路上面的規則。甚至警察的舉手。十字路口的標燈。這一州和那一州也有所不同。因此。許多禍患。就因司機人弄不清這些規則而肇成。各州之中。裏面有一半是駕駛汽車，不必領到執照。更沒有最低年齡的限制。這些地方。肇禍紀錄比嚴格的地方多三分之一。駕駛汽車。需要執照的各州。人們去考照會的時候。要和警官坐在汽車裏面。在熱鬧的區域先去駕駛很多路。在一個山麓下面的斜路上。更要考騐轉灣。停車的呼種手術。同時。要考問他各種交通規則。檢騐目力是否良好。請求執照的人。第二次。第三次。雖然都可及格。但第一次却不取的多。以全國司機人的數量說來。美國確是肇禍紀錄最低的一國。假如一個人駕駛汽車。肇過若干次數禍患之後。照例執照是要吊銷的。但有人提議。這種人在汽車的上面。應得掛一塊巨大的白色牌照。使別的司機人知道他駕駛術幼稚。需要很多地位行駛車輛的。</p>
<p>在美國，關於汽車肇禍問題。除了當局之外。近來車廠方面。亦正加入合作。以冀紀錄低减。許多新車。已裝配不碎玻璃。就是車胎。保險在中途不會爆裂的。在巿塲上面也已發現了。現在所有的新車。重力比舊車低。因此。不和火車相撞的案件很多。因為除了一部分這種十字路口。有守望者或鐵絲門之外。大都是沒有安全設備的。所以火車經過時。容易發生撞車案件。因此。美總統羅斯福曾經主張過把這種十字路拆去一部。而路局方面。也應負一部分經費。作為防止肇禍。以行車的課程和肇禍紀錄作一比較。那麽夜晚比白天多多，個中唯一原因。一方面因為司機人目力在晚上看不見。一方面因為對面的來車。燈光太强。使人張目不開。所以有若干地方。已禁止在夜晚用强光的車燈。或是着司機人看見對面有來車時。把燈光减暗。而最近又有人發明一種公路車燈。使人白天也可看出燈光。為了用　氣光的緣故。就是車輛開得很速。也非常安全。連得在黑夜之中。不用前照燈。也很安全呢。</p>
<p>在一個邦國之中。他們的客車。公共汽車。貨車有二千五百萬輛。當局要維持交通安全。的確不是一件容易的事。因此。在大學敎中。現在交通管理。已列入正式的課程。在訓練這項人材。最近美國方面。發明一種雙波制度」。管理交通。在芝加哥的米西根路上。這種制度已在嘗試了。在這新制度之下。行車的速率。每小時不准超過三十哩。十字路口看見紅燈換了綠燈。雖是交通擁擠。也可大膽前行。不必停車。這種制度。在一條馬路上。分兩瑞執行。此外另有一種方法。是一種警備車的裏面。裝了傅聲筒。每輛有兩個警官。一人駕車。一人察看。在馬路上巡行。觀察的一人。面前就是一隻很高的傅聲筒。他所說的話。半哩以外的汽車。也可聽見。警車在街上巡行。看見有的司機人不守規則。失於自檢。便要加以警告。使人注意。因此。看見這輛警車經過。司機人會特別注意。而老遠聽見警告別人的聲音自己也會警惕起來。這也未始不是一種防止肇禍的新方法呢。</p>
<h3>林肯賽飛車展覽盛况</h3>
<p>一九三寺年十一月二日汽車界新出品林肯賽飛。（Lincoin　Zephyr）及林肯汽車。在紐約巿阿斯特飯店作第一天之公并陳列。被吸引而來參觀者逾六萬一千人。</p>
<p>此賽飛車在中價車類中為最新產物。由福特汽車分司與林肯汽車公司雙方通力合作聯合資源。始克成此結晶。不論外觀或工程上之設計。無一不設想新奇。採取最進步之觀念。所利用之一切原理。竟有為汽車生產界從未見諸實行者。</p>
<p>此車裝有一種新發展之一百十匹馬力V一二引擎。其姿態則為大量生產所製汽車中最完美流綫化者。亦為美舟大陸不用向有車框或車底盤而造成之第一輛汽車。其車身為全鋼「橋樑維繋」式。具有超常之堅强力。引擎之安裝。卽在其中。活動之齒輪。亦卽附着其上。</p>
<p>阿斯特飯店中之陳列。更包括福特A八貨車及商用汽車。全數共計四十二輛。同時更在紐約福特零售陳列室中作同一車輛之陳列。第一日來實際逹二萬二千人。而公園衖飯店中所舉行較小範圍之客車陳列。則有七千人。阿斯特飯店中。每日更放映介紹新出賽飛車之活動電影。每日觀者亦逹三千人。</p>
<h3>汽車機器之潤滑問題</h3>
<p>— 小昂</p>
<p>大凡兩機件徑一度之磨擦。其結果不外機件之發熱。材料之磨損。單就自動車而論。制動機所磨去之材料言之。年可逹十餘萬噸。其他能力之消耗當然不貲。機油之使用卽在减少此弊。置任何表面平滑之金屬於顯微鏡下觀之。則顯凹凸不平之象。兩機件之間所使用之機滑油卽儲於此面處。而營其滑潤之責。有時油質亦可被金屬所吸及。呈玻璃之光澤。汽缸內常有此現象。</p>
<p>滑油之種類旣多。而應用之方亦異。略言之於下。</p>
<p>機軸及軸承之滑潤。當機軸運轉時。基於劈尖之作用。軸身因以增高。其間之壓力。因以有最高最低之處。機滑油之加進。當在壓力最低之處。其理甚明。（A）滑潤器之種類。其用於機軸及軸承者不外。（a）Oil　hole　卽在軸承上穿一孔。時時注油於內。（b）Siphon用一端浸入滑油之棉紗條。其他一端則下臨軸上。沒滴得以間歇落軸上。（c）Necdle　Lubricator軸與軸承之間。常略留空隙。故運轉時遂發生震動。因以引動一滑潤器之針形活門。滑油得以流出。當機軸靜心時。針因動力下垂。滑油得不漏出。因有此種之調節。是以較上述二者為經濟。（d）Chain圍一鏈索於軸上。而下端浸於滑油內。鏈一轉動。遂携滑油以俱上。（e）Collar其作用與上同。惟易Chain為Collar而已。（f）Mechanical　Lubriactor滑油因Pump之緊壓。遂形成Ciculating　System　用過之污水。經一度之濾過。得以再用。且軸承所生之熱。亦可因滑油之循環運轉。得以流出。此乃Lubicator中之最經濟而最着成效者。機器無論大小。多樂用之。</p>
<p>汽缸與汽餅。引擎之功能。消耗於汽缸與汽餅之阻力者。有時逹百分之十。不充分滑潤。則汽缸間發生糟雜之音。可聽而知。其所用之滑潤器。為Hydrostatic　Lubricator　利用冷凝水之壓力。營滑潤之作用。另有用噴射器者。要之不外期滑油形成細小之油點。混於蒸汽內。附着於汽缸及汽餅口而已。普通有用混合油者。惟附有冷凝器之蒸汽器則不可用。須完全用礦物油。</p>
<p>滑油之種類及應用方法。已於上述。汽車機器滑油之選擇。應特別加之注意。總之滑油愈佳。則汽車生命愈遠。而速度亦愈增。旅行長途愈加舒暢。汽車家應注意及之。</p>

<h3>Zhao Lanping Discusses Remedial Measures for the Decline in Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Nanjing: According to economic expert Zhao Lanping, the silver price has fallen by eight pence in the past two weeks. The difference between the British exchange parity and the actual exchange rate is only three and a half pence. It is difficult for China to take the opportunity to sell silver. The new gold standard system, which I advocated in the past, using paper currency domestically and gold externally, is difficult to realize. However, there is no need to worry. If the silver price continues to fall and the British exchange parity drops to the current exchange rate, the silver bullion standard system can be implemented, using silver externally and paper currency internally. Although the fundamental reform of the currency system has not been completed, the current general economic difficulties can still be resolved. At that time, if the international balance of payments is insufficient, the exchange rate can be slightly increased above the parity to absorb silver. In short, silver is still a valuable commodity and will never fall to valuelessness. It is also beneficial to us if the silver price can be stabilized at around 35 cents per US dollar. At present, the exchange rates of local auxiliary currencies and silver should be unified, and no action should be taken. We can wait until the US silver policy is clear next spring before deciding on a solution. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>How to Maintain the Students' Patriotic Movement</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the student patriotic movement, this newspaper has repeatedly discussed it. Recently, the incident of Nankai students going to Beijing to petition was first seen in the northern schools and local authorities, which were bitterly resisted. Later, representatives from the central government rushed to persuade them to return to Tianjin. Following this, Zhejiang University students in Hangzhou were arrested for planning to gather in Beijing, and the president resigned. In Shanghai, Fudan students went to the capital to petition, but were blocked by the authorities at the North Railway Station. The two sides have been deadlocked for a full day and night, and the issue has not yet been resolved. Observing the current situation and worrying about the future, the reporter believes that the most important thing for the central and local authorities in the development of this situation is how to consistently fulfill their responsibility to protect the students. After all, the students are young and full of emotion. They have long been indignant at foreign insults and have been depressed for a long time. Once they vent their anger, it will be difficult to control. Those who bear the responsibility of guidance should completely eliminate their emotions, carefully consider the psychology of young people, and continue to protect them with good intentions, so that no problems will arise and students will be able to accept persuasion.</p>
<p>At this juncture, Jiang, the head of the Executive Yuan, ordered the Ministry of Education to convene principals of colleges and universities above the junior college level and student representatives from provinces and cities with convenient transportation to gather in Beijing to openly declare the government's policies and exchange views on safeguarding the country. If this matter can be realized on schedule, the government will have the opportunity to clarify how to maintain territorial integrity and how to prevent traitors from succeeding, and students will have the opportunity to understand and appreciate this. On the other hand, the students' desire to petition and their ideas for saving the country will also be contributed to the authorities. The reporter recalls the past, that student movements must seek actual results for their petitions to be satisfied. It is difficult to satisfy them with mere words. The reason why the students are bound to go to Beijing to petition is precisely because of this. The Ministry of Education's convening of student representatives to gather in Beijing so that young students and practical politicians can meet together is also a practical result. The central government's intention to maintain the students' patriotic movement in this way should be understood by local authorities.</p>
<p>This determines that the students' patriotic movement is purely out of patriotic enthusiasm and is not mixed with other factors. This can be known from their declarations and slogans, and can be seen from their actions. Therefore, since its launch, the public opinion has responded and people from all walks of life have sympathized with it, which is rare in the past. Even the political authorities are mostly able to understand their intentions and do not obstruct them. As for why it has reached the current situation, it is because the country has reached a point where it is shocking to see and unbearable to endure. Purely rational persuasion has lost its effectiveness. Now, to seek a good result, it depends on the results of the meeting convened by the Ministry of Education. Before the meeting, the local authorities' well-intentioned maintenance of the student movement is essential.</p>
<h3>Mutual Assistance of Naval Forces in the Mediterranean: Countries Willing to Support Britain, Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia Answer Without Reservations, Spain Hesitates</h3>
<p>London: The British government posed questions to the countries along the Mediterranean coast (namely Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Spain) earlier this month, stating that if the British Navy is attacked in the Mediterranean, are these countries prepared to provide assistance? It is now known that Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia have all replied to Britain, prepared to provide assistance without reservations. Romania said that if Britain requests assistance, it will certainly repay the favor. As for the implementation of naval mutual assistance, British military attaches stationed in these countries will conduct talks with experts from these countries. In addition, Spain's attitude is still hesitant. However, the British government did not directly make a request to it, but the new Foreign Secretary Eden discussed it with the Spanish representative to the League of Nations, Madariaga. As for the mutual assistance arrangements recently discussed by the British and French general staffs, the results are said to be very satisfactory. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid: It is rumored that the British government has posed questions to the Spanish government, stating that if the country's navy is attacked by Italy in the Mediterranean, is Spain prepared to provide assistance? Prime Minister Valladares declared to the press after the cabinet meeting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received a formal note regarding this matter, and that the cabinet meeting today did not discuss it. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: Today, it was learned that the British and French naval staffs recently contacted each other on the matter of mutual assistance in the event of an Italian attack on the British fleet. Some members of the British naval staff discussed this matter in Paris a few days ago. According to London sources, the talks were very satisfactory. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Straits of Tartary: Issue of Fortification, Turkey Asks Britain and France to Lift Treaty Restrictions</h3>
<p>Ankara: It is heard that the British and Turkish governments have exchanged official documents to discuss the conditions under which Turkey can cooperate with Britain in the event of war in the Mediterranean. Turkish officials are currently maintaining absolute silence on this matter. However, according to semi-official sources, Turkey has given a satisfactory reply to Britain's inquiry. Other Balkan countries have also given similar replies. It is widely believed that Turkey will take this opportunity to raise again the issue of building fortresses in the Straits of Tartary. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Paris: Madame Taboui, a famous journalist, recently published an article in the Shih-yeh Pao, describing the visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Rustu to Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval yesterday. She said that the purpose, in addition to discussing the issue of the Mediterranean security organization, also involved the issue of the country's fortification of the Straits of Tartary. Because the Turkish government intends to request the British government to abolish the provisions of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne that forbid the fortification of the Straits of Tartary. When Rustu met with Laval yesterday, he must have requested France to support this request. According to Madame Taboui, "Turkey has been preoccupied with this matter for a long time. As far as we know, the country has long been looking forward to the British government's understanding. Now that Britain has raised the issue of collective security in the Mediterranean, Turkey will naturally consider this opportunity to be one in a thousand, and will take the opportunity to raise the issue of fortification of the Straits of Tartary. We firmly believe that the British government will provide a satisfactory response. As for the French government, it will probably answer that if Britain accepts Turkey's request, then France will not raise any objections. Regarding the French aid to the British Navy in the Mediterranean, Madame Taboui believes that the French government is prepared to make some arrangements, but no decision has been made at this time. As for the oil embargo, once Britain decides to implement it, what attitude France will take is also undecided at this time. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Attitude Towards the Baltic Sea: Britain Gives No Clear Reply, Soviet Union and Other Countries Dissatisfied</h3>
<p>London: It is heard that Soviet Russia and the countries along the Baltic Sea will pose questions to the British government, asking what attitude Britain intends to take in response if Germany dominates the Baltic Sea? Although it is not possible to know exactly how the British government's reply is worded, it is known from this newspaper's visit to Chang that the British reply has not been considered satisfactory by the countries concerned, including Soviet Russia. Britain has used the pretext that the above questions are purely hypothetical and future situations, and therefore refuses to give a clear reply. (Note: Britain recently posed questions to the countries along the Mediterranean coast, stating that if the British Navy is attacked in the Mediterranean, are these countries prepared to provide assistance?)

<h3>Eden Takes Over as Foreign Secretary, First Measure is to Prevent European War, Hoare Goes to Switzerland for Long-Term Recuperation</h3>
<p>London: Eden entered Sandringham Palace this morning to meet with the British Emperor, talked briefly, and then, during the Privy Council meeting, respectfully received the seal of the Foreign Office. He is scheduled to take office as Foreign Secretary tomorrow, and then leave London for a few days of recuperation, but he will still be in contact with the ministry at any time. French Prime Minister Laval sent a telegram of congratulations, which included the line, "I am very happy to work with you to promote the common friendship and peace of our two countries." Former Foreign Secretary Hoare and his wife flew from Croydon Airport to Zurich, Switzerland, today. When asked before leaving whether he would return to the government after a short rest, Hoare replied that he could not talk about his future today. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: Today it was learned that Eden's first step after taking office as the new Foreign Secretary will be to find ways to reduce the danger of an Anglo-Italian war. Now that Britain has obtained guarantees from Mediterranean countries to back Britain in the event of an Italian attack, the British fleet in the Mediterranean will probably withdraw some units soon. Today, the British Emperor summoned Eden to Sandringham Palace and personally bestowed the seal of the Foreign Office. It is understood that Eden has at least temporarily shelved the oil embargo and its severe economic sanctions measures, because this can both satisfy the British people's demands for severely punishing Italy and also take into account the domestic calls for avoiding war. Now the government has regained the guarantees of cooperation with Britain from Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, Spain, and Egypt, in addition to France. (National dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: Political figures believe that after the new Foreign Secretary Eden takes office, he may not intensify the sanctions policy against Italy. Even if he does intensify it, it must wait until mid-January next year. In general, people believe that Eden will not take drastic action against Italy. Britain's attitude will depend on the development of the war in Africa. A message was received here from Rome that Italy has failed halfway in the war in East Africa. The general staff of the expeditionary force has decided to change its tactics, and will advance in a guerrilla manner thereafter, and suspend the activities of the mechanized units.

<h3>Italian Newspapers Criticize British Policy, Saying It Could Endanger European Peace</h3>
<p>Rome. A semi-official Italian newspaper published an article proving that the policies adopted by Britain are sufficient to endanger peace. In brief, the British government is deliberately adopting a policy hostile to Italy and is not seeking a solution to the dispute. Its purpose is nothing more than to automatically create a threat of war in order to use it as an excuse to attack Italy. From this point of view, it is clear that the point of conflict is between Britain and Italy, and not between Italy and the League of Nations. The newspaper also said that the development of the situation shows that countries will repeat the same mistakes by cooperating with the League of Nations. "We have seen various international elements, red, green, black, and grey, all becoming active again, instigating incidents, and hating our country's colonial rights, and dragging all European countries to take crazy actions against Italy. These elements that are disrupting European security are now striding forward, full of hope to achieve their ambitions. It must be known that the Third International knows that the implementation of sanctions against various countries will inevitably cause a major disaster in Europe. It can then take the opportunity to rise up, and its activity will be doubled compared to before. In short, Europe is now in a state of chaos, dark and unseen. All that can be seen is a path leading to destruction. It is difficult to foresee where it will end." (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome. The Italian People's Newspaper, the official newspaper of the Prime Minister, recently published that "the cruel means of the countries that have implemented sanctions against Italy have brought about the threat of war to Europe. Where should European countries go? It is appropriate to choose for themselves, because people have reached this crossroads and should each shoulder their responsibilities to the brilliant world of history and civilization. Italy has the full right to test whether the peace proposals put forward by former British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval are strong and unbreakable. However, before the Fascist Supreme Council decided on its attitude, this proposal suffered a fatal blow. This responsibility should not be borne by Italy." The newspaper then criticized the British government's contact with Mediterranean countries on the 8th of this month to discuss war against Italy (i.e., asking these countries whether they could provide naval assistance when the British navy was threatened by the Italian navy), saying, "Britain proposes peace proposals to Italy on the one hand, and at the same time, or even before, asks Mediterranean countries to form an alliance in preparation for war against Italy. How can these two things be reconciled? Who would believe that Britain is not deceiving Europe? Britain has issued a general naval mobilization order in the Mediterranean, what is its intention? If the League of Nations does not allow it, Britain urgently requires the Mediterranean countries to expand their mobilization scope. If it is not with the permission of the League of Nations, then on what principle is it doing so?" (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Libyan Border: Italian and Ethiopian Soldiers Clash; Egyptian Authorities Deny It, But the Situation Remains Tense</h3>
<p>Cairo. Rumors that Italian and Ethiopian soldiers clashed on the Libyan border have been denied by the Egyptian Ministry of Military Affairs today. However, the rumors have been circulating for a long time, and the denial has only been made now, leading observers to believe that the clash may not be completely fabricated. After the news of the clash spread, there was great unease here, especially among the public. The government's order to extend the service period of 1,200 reservists has further increased the tension. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Army's Clever Strategy Defeats the Enemy: Using Scarecrows to Lure the Enemy Deep, Italian Soldiers Fall into an Ambush and Are Slaughtered</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital. The Abyssinian army in the north recently won a great victory over the Italian army in the Danbian area, near Adia Bi, using a clever strategy and capturing tanks. The tactic used was to place a large number of scarecrows in white clothes in the positions, which looked like soldiers from a distance. When Italian aircraft scouted the area, they immediately dropped bombs and destroyed them. The tanks and infantry in the rear, believing that the remaining enemies here had been wiped out, also advanced, unaware that the Abyssinian troops were all wearing their native brown uniforms and hiding on nearby hills. When the Italian army went deep, they were suddenly surrounded and slaughtered, and ten tanks were captured. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in the Danbian Area: Intense Artillery Fire Followed by Hand-to-Hand Combat; Abyssinian Army Resists Forcefully but is Eventually Defeated</h3>
<p>Rome. According to a communiqué, an Italian and Eritrean mixed brigade fought a major battle with 5,000 Abyssinian soldiers near Adia Bi in the Danbian area and defeated them. The intensity of the Italian artillery bombardment was the first decisive battle on the northern front since the start of the war on October 3. The Abyssinian army attempted to flank the left wing of the Italian army. The Italian army counterattacked, followed by fierce hand-to-hand combat with bayonets and Abyssinian knives and gun stocks. The Italian army had mountain artillery, aircraft, and machine guns to help. As a result, the Abyssinian army retreated to the Tongzhua Valley and eventually fled. The Italian and Eritrean soldiers pursued them. The terrain advanced by the Italian army was rugged and sometimes impassable. The Italian artillery was ambushed behind the hills and was still able to bombard the Abyssinian positions with artillery shells. This battle drove the Abyssinian army out of a forty-square-mile fertile land that produced grain. This is one of the main sources of food supply in the Danbian area, so the Abyssinian army may feel the difficulty of military food from now on. According to official announcements, 600 Abyssinian soldiers were killed and 1,000 were wounded. Two Italian white officers and three Eritrean officers were killed, and 100 Eritrean soldiers were wounded. Italian aircraft inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

As for the amnesty order issued by the government on Christmas, the number of political prisoners pardoned is as follows: Regarding the Social Democratic Party members who were arrested for participating in the February 1934 riots, the total number is 170. It is decided to release 154 of them. The other 16 are not included in the amnesty because they committed murder. The prosecution of 19 cadres of the party, who were originally intended to be prosecuted by the court, will also be stopped due to the amnesty. Regarding the members of the National Socialist Party who were implicated in the assassination of the late Prime Minister Dollfuss in July last year, 16 of them with lighter circumstances will also be released. There are also 955 people who were sentenced by the court for administrative errors, and they will also be granted probation. In addition, there are 170 prisoners in detention camps in various places, and 125 prisoners who participated in the assassination of the late Prime Minister Dollfuss, who are not included in the amnesty because of their serious crimes.

<h3>Famous American Aviator Lindbergh Flees to England; Secretly Leaves the Country Temporarily After Repeatedly Receiving Threatening Letters; One Theory is to Discuss Atlantic Aviation Matters</h3>
<p>New York. The news of the Lindberghs' trip to England with their children surprised the whole country. Readers initially suspected that the statement was inaccurate. Later, they learned that the Lindberghs and their three children had indeed departed on a ship that was scheduled to arrive in Liverpool on December 30. Lindbergh's departure was extremely secretive. Even his mother, who currently lives in Troy, did not know about it. Lindbergh often received threatening letters about kidnapping and killing his young son, so he made a plan to move to a better place. According to a friend closely related to the Lindbergh family in Eagle, New Jersey, Lindbergh does not want to live in England forever. However, according to reliable sources, Lindbergh does not want to return to the country until the Hauptmann case has been forgotten. A few hours after the news of Lindbergh's trip to England spread, Hauptmann immediately submitted a petition for pardon to the New Jersey pardon office. Its contents have not yet been revealed. According to the plan, Hauptmann's death sentence will be carried out within one week starting on January 13, 1936. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>New York. The famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh recently set off for England with his wife and three-year-old child. Although his whereabouts were extremely secretive, they were still known to the newspapers. Speculation about Lindbergh's motives for this action is nothing more than the following: Lindbergh recently received many threatening letters, all threatening to kill his young son. He has been like a frightened bird since the kidnapping of his beloved son three years ago, so he moved overseas to avoid it. The kidnapper Hauptmann is scheduled to be executed on January 13, so he went abroad before the execution and will return to the country afterward. The Governor of New Jersey decided to request a retrial of the Hauptmann case. Lindbergh believed that the case had been infiltrated by political issues and could not be brought out again, so he decided to go abroad. In addition, there is another theory that Lindbergh's trip is to England to discuss the establishment of regular Atlantic aviation services. Pan American Airways confirmed that Lindbergh had indeed gone to Europe and will continue to serve as a technical consultant for the company. The State Department declined to comment on Lindbergh's trip. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>America's Alarming Debt; Reaching One-Fifth of the Nation's Wealth</h3>
<p>New York. The board of directors of the National Industrial Conference Board stated today that the public debt of the United States Federal Government and state governments has reached 500 billion US dollars.

The department said that the trend of increasing public debt is a serious problem for the country. In addition, five-sixths of the new debts issued by the Federal Government are absorbed by national banks. In fact, this situation is expansion. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Incident of Japanese and Puppet Troops Committing Atrocities Across the Border; Outer Mongolian Authorities File a Protest; Demanding Punishment of the Culprits, Compensation, and an Apology</h3>
<p>Moscow. Moscow newspapers published a report from Kulun that the Acting Prime Minister of the Mongolian Republic, 丙阁, and Acting Foreign Minister Zhuobusan telegraphed a protest to the Foreign Minister of "Manchukuo" regarding the armed looting of the Mongolian border by Japanese and "Manchu" troops on December 19. They said that the Japanese and "Manchu" troops killed and captured 16 Hao Gu border guards. They continued to say that the government of the Mongolian Republic protested most resolutely against the actions of the Japanese and "Manchu" troops, that is, the illegal invasion of the Mongolian border by the Japanese and "Manchu" troops, and the killing of Hao Gu border guards, and the destruction of the property of the Mongolian state. At the same time, they also demanded that the "Manchu government" immediately return the captured soldiers, investigate this incident, severely punish the personnel responsible for directing this attack, compensate for the destroyed and looted property, and finally, the "Manchu government" should formally apologize for this incident and guarantee that such looting of the Mongolian Republic's border will not happen again in the future. The protest letter recounted that in the Manzhouli Conference, the Mongolian government strongly advocated the establishment of a border mixed committee to resolve and prevent various border disputes, but "Manchu" expressed opposition to this proposal and continued to attack the border policy, attempting to forcibly occupy Mongolian territory. The Mongolian Republic 政府 thought it reasonable to warn the "Manchu government" that if the sudden attack by the Japanese and "Manchu" troops on the Mongolian Republic 引 caused serious results, the "Manchu" and Japanese governments should be fully responsible, because their troops directly and proactively participated in such attacks. (TASS dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Regarding the dispute between the troops of the two countries that occurred west of Lake 波衣尔 in the "Manchu"-Mongolian border on the 19th of this month, the Outer Mongolian Foreign Minister had protested to the "Manchukuo" government on the 22nd regarding this matter, demanding an apology, compensation, and future guarantees. According to the information issued by the local army to the Central Army Department, it is known that this Outer Mongolian government's protest is not true at all. The "Manchukuo" side had, at the Manzhouli Conference, in order to prevent border disputes and to establish friendly relations between the two countries, advocated sincerity. However, the Outer Mongolian side was greatly restrained by the Soviet forces behind it, causing the conference to break down. This was a disaster caused by not seeing each other with sincerity. The "Manchukuo" side, based on the determination expressed at the time of the conference's breakdown, aimed to substantially determine the 界, and is now dispatching a team to investigate, learning that the Outer Mongolian troops who crossed the border and occupied the area illegally overstepped their authority and caused a conflict. The "Manchukuo" government, based on this fact, decided to ignore the Outer Mongolian protest. At the same time, if the Outer Mongolian side still refuses to acknowledge the negotiations to determine the border, it points out that the dispute is likely to occur frequently and urges them to reflect deeply. The Central Army Department attaches great importance to this situation in ensuring the security of the "Manchukuo" border. (United Dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>London Silver Group Formed to Assist in Absorbing Futures; Silver Market Expected to Stabilize</h3>
<p>London. It was learned today that a silver group has been organized here by a manager of a large bank in New York to assist the silver market in accepting the current forward contracts due in London. This will enable the silver market to properly dispose of the spot goods, and brokers can also breathe a sigh of relief. Because most of the recent futures sales were from banks in the Far East, the contracts could not be cancelled, and brokers were greatly troubled. Now that there is a silver group to absorb them, everyone hopes that the trend can be slightly stabilized. (National Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

The Anxi iron ore deposits are rich, and the quality of Panshan ore is good. However, Panshan is located in high mountains, making transportation difficult. Exploration will first determine the ore reserves and assess whether they are worth mining. At the same time, transportation routes will be studied. Mineral exploration will take ten months, and railway and harbor surveys will take two to three months. If mining is deemed worthwhile, all further actions will be decided by the central government. The exploration will receive full technical assistance. Whether we will undertake the mining in the future and how to raise capital will not be discussed until the amount of ore and transportation issues are clarified.

<h3>Discussions on Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>— Edited by Tang Qingzeng</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>— Qian Tianda</p>
<p>Sericulture in our country has a history of thousands of years. The area for raising silkworms and producing silk is almost the same size as our country's territory. It is indeed one of the most common and important side occupations in rural areas, and it occupies an important position in foreign trade. Since the failure of the silk industry, the rural economy has collapsed, the urban economy has declined, and the entire national economy has been affected, facing the danger of total collapse. However, due to the unstable domestic political situation and the withering of various industries, this serious problem has not been noticed by the people of the country. Although improvement associations and other organizations have been established, they are limited by power and financial resources, and cannot achieve the ideal effect of control. Now, a brief description of the failure of the silk industry in our country and its importance is made to attract the attention of the people of the country and provide reference for those who are concerned about the silk industry and the national economy.</p>
<p>It is said that the earliest exports of silk from our country were finished products, such as silk paintings. As the textile industry developed in foreign countries, the export of silk raw materials exceeded the trend of silk goods. However, at this time, both silk raw materials and silk goods were handicrafts. It was not until 1867 that Chen Qiyuan of Guangdong Province created a new silk factory, changing the old handicrafts into mechanical industries. At this point, China's silk industry began to show signs of improvement. (In Shanghai, Huang Zuoqing established a factory on the bank of the North Suzhou River in 1881 (the seventh year of the Guangxu era), named Gonghe Yong. Later, Wuxi Yuchang Silk Factory and others were established one after another.) However, since the beginning of the 20th century, Japan suddenly rose to compete, refining with scientific methods and operating with new machinery. The output was large and the silk quality was good. European and American countries competed to purchase it. During this period, the silk industry in our country not only did not have an active and enterprising spirit, but also adhered to old methods and stood still. At that time, the government did not have a strict commodity inspection system, and delayed and erred, which led to the overseas market being given away with both hands and being unable to be saved, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Table of the Decreasing Trend of Raw Silk Exports in the Last Ten Years</p>
<p>After 1929, the world economic panic broke out, and the purchasing power of various countries decreased. The sales of Chinese silk were further reduced. Although the price of silver fell during this period, it still did not help exports. After Japan re-embargoed gold in 1931, it relied on the fall in currency prices and its government's strong subsidies. Therefore, although Japanese silk exports were in this deep abyss of panic, they were still able to barely support it. However, Chinese silk was even more left behind at this point. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the highest price of silk from the Shanghai B-character factory was 1,150 taels per load, and the lowest price was 880 taels. It can be seen that since the 19th year, the price of silk has begun to decline. Therefore, there was a request to the government to issue public bonds to save the critical situation. After repeated petitions from silk merchants, the government approved the exemption of export taxes and the issuance of 8 million yuan in public bonds to provide relief, with one-quarter for improving sericulture, one-quarter for improving silk factory equipment, and two-quarters for Jiangzhe silk factories to implement relief. After the January 28th Incident in the 21st year, the market was sluggish, and the domestic silk industry felt that it could not be maintained. The price of silk even fell to 540 taels, sales were stagnant, and inventory increased. Silk merchants felt even more unable to turn around, so there was a second issuance of public bonds to register old silk and old cocoons, and to reward the export of raw silk by 100 yuan per load, and to exempt minor customs duties. This measure was completed in the spring of the 32nd year, but this method was only a temporary expedient, and it was also a drop in the bucket, which did not help the progress of the entire silk industry. In March and April of the 23rd year (1934), the sales of Chinese silk showed a slight boom due to the increase in prices in the United States, and the price also increased accordingly. People were praying that it would rise like Qingyun. Unexpectedly, after autumn, it fell again and could not recover. The selling price was low and sales were even more stagnant. Manufacturers suffered heavily. This spring (24th year), the United States implemented a silver purchasing policy, and the price of silver increased rapidly, from about 30 cents per ounce to more than 70 cents. The export of Chinese silk was further hindered, and the market price fell to 400 yuan. The silk industry was almost in a state of no return. After the spring cocoons came on the market, the silk market gradually progressed, and it has risen about twice as much from the lowest price. The implementation of the new currency policy has made the domestic silk price rise even more due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange. The number of exports has also greatly increased. From June to October this year, 20,000 bales have been exported. Looking at the increasing consumption of raw silk in the United States recently, the future of Chinese silk is indeed promising. Not only can international trade reverse the decline, but the rural economy is also like a life-saving elixir. The rural economy of our country has always relied on side occupations other than crop harvests for adjustment. In the rural areas of the provinces in the Yellow River Basin, the side occupations of farmers are not very developed, so they are not as prosperous as those in the rural areas of Jiangzhe. Among the rural side occupations, sericulture is the most profitable. Outside of Jiangzhe, such as Sichuan, Guangdong, and Shandong, there are also many farming families who rely on the harvest of spring orchids to make ends meet, and even their clothing, food, and housing are mostly dependent on this. It is only because there is a lack of accurate statistical materials to prove it, so it has not been noticed by the general public. As for the importance of the position of our country's silk industry in foreign trade, there is no need to elaborate. By reading the following two concise tables, it can be understood;</p>
<p>Comparative Table of Important Export Goods (Unit: Million Customs Taels)</p>
<p>From the above two tables, it can be seen that the importance of raw silk in foreign trade is that it can increase national wealth in a positive aspect, and can also offset some debts and balance international expenditures in a passive aspect. Since the failure of Chinese tea, foreign trade has almost entirely relied on raw silk for replenishment. Therefore, the position of raw silk is even more important. The implementation of the new currency policy and exchange rate management are the prelude to controlling international trade. We deeply hope that foreign trade can gradually develop under the stable policy of the new exchange rate, and we also hope that the international balance of payments will tend to be balanced under the conditions of reduced imports and increased exports.</p>

<h3>Wuhan Students' Parade Comes to an End; Wuchang Students Cross the River in Two Days; On the Way Home, They Go to the Construction Department and Destroy Items</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that all students from secondary and higher schools in Wuhan have held large-scale demonstrations and parades for several days. Due to the Construction Department's suspension of ferry services, they camped out on the riverbank, enduring hunger and cold. Their intense patriotic sentiments have greatly excited the people of Wuhan. Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun, Acting Provincial Chairman Lu Zhu, Education Director Cheng Qibao, Mayor Wu Zhen, Garrison Commander Chen Jicheng, and others believed that the students' actions were driven purely by patriotic fervor and that it would be difficult to stop them as long as they strictly observed discipline. Therefore, they agreed to allow Wuchang students to cross the river in batches on the 22nd and 23rd to parade. The students' goal was thus completely achieved. At 9:00 AM on the 22nd, it was stipulated that the first batch of students from schools crossing the river should gather at the Hanyangmen. This included Wuhan University, Huazhong University, Art College, Sanchu Middle School, Experimental School, Anhui Middle School, Dajiang Middle School, Shandao Girls' Middle School, Chengda Girls' Middle School, Provincial No. 1 Girls' Middle School, Wuchang Women's Vocational School, Wuchang Normal School, Linghu Middle School, Jingnan Middle School, Provincial Senior Business School, Wuchang Junior High School, Wenhua Library School, Bowen Middle School, Zhangchu Middle School, and 19 other schools, totaling more than 2,000 people. They took the Pu'an, Jianhan, and Canghan ferries from the Hanyangmen wharf and landed at the Wangjiagang wharf in Hankou. Students from Hankou Yixun Girls' Middle School, St. Cana's Girls' Middle School, and other schools warmly welcomed them on the riverbank. They then joined the parade, electing a representative from Wuhan University as the general commander and a representative from Huazhong University as the deputy commander. They started from Wangjiagang, passed through Minquan Road, Sanmin Road, the Municipal Government, Jisheng Fourth Road, Sanma Road, Liudu Bridge, Minsheng Road, and reached the Jianghan Customs. They shouted slogans along the way, which were both tragic and passionate. The onlookers on both sides were like walls, all clapping to show their sympathy. The traffic was temporarily cut off wherever they passed, and the police reinforced their posts to maintain order. In addition to distributing leaflets along the way, the propaganda team also gave simple speeches. Many citizens were moved to tears. At 1:30 PM, the entire group arrived at the Jianghan Customs, where the audience was even more crowded. The students' slogans to save the country shook the mountains and made them feel even more excited. After the parade, they took the Jianhan and other ferries back to Wuchang from Wharf 1. Elementary school students also organized a慰劳 team to welcome them at Hanyangmen and distributed food. Around 3:00 PM, they dispersed and returned to their respective schools. The second batch of students was scheduled to cross the river on the 23rd. Cheng Qibao, the Director of Education, made a speech on this student movement, saying, "Since this patriotic movement of students was launched in Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Changsha, this is also a manifestation of the patriotic sentiments of young students based on their conscience. The education authorities have nothing to criticize. However, young people are full of vigor and must suppress their temporary emotions and use reason to engage in this kind of movement. Every move should be in line with the norm. Today's difficult national situation does not allow otherwise. Moreover, the work of saving the country cannot be accomplished in a day or two. If valuable time is wasted for a long time, it will not only not help the country, but also damage personal studies, which is also a loss to the country. Therefore, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education urged 'saving the country through reading' in his telegram to the educational circles. This is what I hope from the students in Wuhan. The various actions of the students in Wuhan in the past few days have fully demonstrated their patriotism, and the request of the students in Wuchang to cross the river has also been fulfilled. Each school should resume classes as usual from today."</p>
<p>A continuing dispatch states that the second batch of students from Zhonghua University, Education College, Wenhua Middle School, Wenhua Second Division, Dagong Middle School, Wuchang Vocational School, Qunhua Middle School, Rural Normal School, Second Girls' Middle School, Enan Middle School, Wuchang Middle School, Lve Enan Hunan Women's Vocational School, Yuije Middle School, Zhangchu Middle School, Chucai Middle School, Provincial High School, Qihuang Middle School, Wenhua Middle School, Higher Agriculture, Wuhan University Agriculture, and 21 other schools, with more than 8,000 students, crossed the river on the 23rd! At nine o'clock, the second batch crossed the Han River on the Baolong, Wu'an, Jianhan, and Canghan ferries. The students from Hankou participating included Xinmian Girls' Middle School, Zizhi Middle School, Boxue Middle School, Guanghua Middle School, Zhongxue Middle School, and five other schools. The students from Hanyang Higher Industry, Xun Girls' Middle School, Hanyang Junior High School, and Xiaozhi Middle School, four schools, lined up around the statue of President Sun Yat-sen on Sanmin Road to wait. When the Wuchang Hankou student contingents passed by, they joined the group, totaling more than 10,000 people. The parade route first followed the regulations of the 22nd, passing through Minquan Road, Sanmin Road, the Municipal Government Road. When reaching Zhongshan Road, the route was temporarily changed and passed through Jiaotong Road and then Hualou, and then returned to Minsheng Road. Later, some students wanted to express opposition to a certain store and requested to exit Hualou, passing through Jianghan Road to Jianghan Customs. Many people tried to dissuade them at the time, but the students were extremely excited and even sat on the ground, intending not to move forward. Therefore, the parade still exited Hualou, passed through Jianghan Road, and reached Wharf 1. During this section, the military police were heavily guarded and the students shouted the most impassioned slogans. Photographers along the way had their cameras taken away by the students. At 1:30 PM, more than 10,000 students arrived in front of Jianghan Customs and shouted slogans together for half an hour. The Wuhan students bid farewell to the Hankou and Hanyang students and returned south by boat. On the way back, they passed the Construction Department. Due to the department's suspension of ferry services, the group went to question the director of the Construction Department, Liu Shoupeng. Liu avoided meeting them, and some items in the department were destroyed, but it did not cause any incidents. The student movement in Wuhan will come to an end here. (23rd)</p>
<h3>The Only Sugar Manufacturing Enterprise: Jinan Puyi Sugar Factory; Daily Production Capacity of 120,000 Jin of Sugar; Shortage of Raw Materials Cannot Meet Demand</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that our country's sugar consumption largely relies on Britain and Japan. Customs statistics show that the value of foreign sugar imported annually is 130 million yuan. Our country has only three sugar beet sugar factories: Jinan Puyi Factory, Sichuan, and Guangdong, etc. Among these three, Puyi is the largest. The factory was originally organized by former Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang and others, with a capital of more than 5 million yuan. The initial equipment cost 3.5 million yuan, with the machinery alone reaching 2 million yuan. It was large in scale and the machinery was new. It was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China. Unfortunately, the manager was not the right person, and the sales were blocked by the war, which led to its closure. Last year, Yuan Liang again contacted Sun Lianzhong and others to raise capital to revive it. The old shareholders used the machinery as a valuation of 1.2 million yuan, and a certain amount of new shares were added to purchase sugar beet seeds and distribute them to farmers to plant. On the one hand, technicians were hired to sort out the machinery. Now that the sugar beets have been harvested and transported, the factory has started manufacturing. On the 15th of this month, products have been transported to the market for sale, and it has been decided to open up sales in the western region in order to recover a part of the profits. It is a pity that there have been frequent disasters this year, and the sugar beet harvest has been poor, failing to reach the expected number. The harvested sugar beets are only enough for about one month of use. Once the raw materials are used up, they will have to change course and manufacture alcohol (the factory has an alcohol factory). They will wait until next year to promote planting again. Our country's sugar market has been occupied by imported goods for decades. The people of the country are eager to make their own sugar. It is expected that the future development of the factory is unlimited. The current situation of the factory is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Raw material planting sugar beets are mostly of the radish class. The seeds are purchased in Germany. This summer, the factory distributed them to farmers for planting. The range is in the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River and on both sides of the Xiaoqing River. Originally, 25,000 mu were planted. Unexpectedly, disasters came frequently, first drought and then floods, leaving only more than 10,000 mu. Each mu produces 3,000 jin to 5,000 jin of sugar beets. Because farmers did not have much faith in the factory before, the factory set the price in advance when planting this year. Each 1,000 jin delivered to the factory is priced at 8 yuan. For those who do not deliver, the freight is deducted according to the distance of the road. Seeds are sold to farming households at 1 yuan and 3 jiao per jin. Those who prepay fertilizer costs 3 jiao per jin, and those who do not prepay fertilizer costs 1 jiao per jin. The price of seeds and fertilizers are deducted from the vegetable price. On average, each farming household can earn a net profit of more than 20 yuan per mu after expenses, which is much more profitable than planting other grains. This year, 10,000 mu of sugar beets were planted throughout the province, totaling a profit of more than 200,000 yuan, which is a small supplement to the poor rural economy. They have now been harvested and are being transported to Jinan one after another. Because most of the planters are by the river, they are mostly transported by boat, and others are transported to the factory by donkeys and carts, shoulder to shoulder, which is like a downtown area.</p>

<p>After the sugar beets arrive at the factory, they are first transported by light vehicles to the weighing place. After weighing, they are transported into a brick-built rectangular pool. Because there is a lot of mud, the factory opened a ditch from the Xiaoqing River behind the factory and diverted water into the yard. The workers use iron shovels to put the sugar beets into the water for rinsing. The water flow is very rapid, and the impact of the water is used to flush the sugar beets into the factory building. Then, a waterwheel is used to rotate the sugar beets into the upper iron trough. After being washed again, it is mechanically transported to the weighing device upstairs. Every 5,000 jin is automatically leaked down. Then, those who accept the leaked down from the weighing device start to build into thin strips, and then transport the thin strips to the upper floor and put them into dozens of round steam pots to dissolve and boil three times, and then turn them into a white thick liquid. The slag is transported to the outside of the factory through iron pipes. The liquid is the raw material for sugar making, and it is put into the sugar boiling pot for decoction. After passing through more than a dozen sugar boiling pots, the heat is gradually increased until the most extreme, and then it becomes an English red thick liquid, shaped like honey. Then, it is put into the honey extractor to separate the honey and keep it for brewing materials. The rest becomes white sugar, which is sent to another room. More than a dozen workers use iron shovels to pile up, shaped like a pile of . Then, from the room below, the white sugar is weighed. The sugar making procedure is completed. Because all are used electric motors, the beets are taken from the east of the factory and made into white sugar at the west end. The procedure is very fast. The beet dregs sent out are provided to the nearby villagers for feeding pigs free of charge. It is said that German sugar factories can turn the dregs into fertilizer.</p>
<p>Business overview</p>
<p>Every ten jins of sugar beets can produce 120 jins to 130 jins of sugar. The cost is about 12 yuan per 100 jins. The current market price is 17 yuan per 100 jins. It is expected that each 100 jins can have a profit of 5 yuan. At the beginning of the product, De Xu Cheng Ji in this city has already underwritten it, and Sanbing is also in contact. Users are happy to eat domestic sugar. The sugar will also pay attention to the sales in the northwest area in the future. There is a great trend of supply exceeding demand. If the factory's machinery is fully powered, it can produce 500 tons of titanium material every day, producing 120,000 jins of sugar, with a value of about 20,000 yuan and a profit of about 6,000 yuan. This year, the raw materials are in short supply, and it is estimated that they are only enough for 20 days. At the beginning of the plan to revive this year, it was believed that if the raw materials could be collected in the predetermined quantity, the sugar making work could last until mid-February next year. After the weather warms up, it is not suitable for sugar making, so alcohol is manufactured instead. Now that the raw materials are not enough for two and a half months, alcohol can only be manufactured in advance to avoid delaying the work. Also, because the machines in the factory only work for half a year each year, it was planned to transport sugar materials (i.e. raw sugar) from the Nanyang area to Jinan for refining and selling everywhere, which would also be profitable. A request was made to the authorities to exempt taxes on transportation, but the result was not approved, so the previous plan was temporarily suspended. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Chaoan Seizes Smuggled Goods: Rong Kee's Goods Entirely Confiscated, a Foreign Firm Intervenes to Protect Them</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Smuggled goods from Chao-Shan flood the market, especially peanuts, raw oil, foreign rice, soybeans, and various grains. There are thirty-eight businesses and foreign firms engaged in smuggling. They have formed an association with substantial capital and foreign backing. They have branches and sub-branches in the cities of Chaoan and Jieyang. Smuggled oil, rice, beans, and other goods are transported from other ports to Youtou in large quantities and stored in the Wugiao warehouses. The front of the warehouse has an exit to a tributary of the Han River, making water transportation very convenient. Since these smuggled goods are not subject to agricultural taxes after arriving in Shantou, each load is cheaper than those transported by Chinese merchants. For example, each load of raw oil is more than five yuan cheaper. These smuggled goods arrive from other ports in overwhelming quantities, not only seizing the market share of Chinese merchants but also causing a sharp decline in tax revenue. The authorities are intensifying their efforts to combat smuggling. Fan Zhanpeng, the deputy director of the provincial land and water anti-smuggling bureau, has led anti-smuggling agents and inspectors to Chao-Shan to set up an anti-smuggling network and strictly investigate and crack down. For a time, the atmosphere was quite tense. Countless stalls selling rice and beans were originally located along the roadsides and in the poor residential areas of Shantou. It is said that these were consigned by certain merchants. They earned a commission based on daily sales. Since the strict implementation of anti-smuggling measures, seven or eight out of ten of these rice stalls have disappeared. In addition, rice and beans are piled up like mountains in a certain warehouse in Wugiao, making sales impossible. However, every time a foreign merchant transports smuggled goods inland, he always sends a ruffian to protect them. Sometimes, when the ships carrying smuggled goods pass through villages and towns, they distribute and sell them along the way. As a result, many merchants who are greedy for profit still sell these smuggled goods. For example, Rong Kee in Chaoan City, a large oil mill owner, used to purchase domestic peanuts to extract and sell oil. Recently, he turned to a foreign merchant to purchase large quantities of smuggled peanuts. At the same time, he purchased a small amount of taxable goods from Chinese merchants in Shantou and mixed them in. He also attached stamped tax-paid bags to the goods. Therefore, they always save the bags for future use. This is a clever trick of the merchant. On the 11th of this month, anti-smuggling agents in Chaoan saw porters transporting large quantities of untaxed raw peanuts to Rong Kee. They intercepted the porters and the goods midway. The porters confessed that they were hired by Rong Kee, more than ten in total. For the past ten days or so, they had been transporting goods from a foreign firm to Rong Kee every day, and they only received a small amount of porterage fees. The anti-smuggling branch immediately dispatched a team to arrest several partners of Rong Kee and confiscated all the goods in the shop. The shop owner has fled to a certain place. The partners and laborers of Rong Kee were escorted to Shantou. A certain north-south trading firm in Shantou claimed that Rong Kee had always traded with them and that the proceeds from the goods sold by the firm had not yet been recovered. The surface of the confiscated peanuts was marked with the name of the firm that issued them, and they also held a transfer certificate. The reason why it was not affixed to the bag was a mistake by the boatman. Therefore, they submitted a petition to the Shantou North-South Trading Firm, Grain, and Oil Industry Association, requesting them to forward the petition to the Shantou Anti-Smuggling Director, requesting the return of a portion of the taxed beans to protect the merchants' capital. At the same time, a certain foreign firm in Chaoan also intervened to protect Rong Kee, claiming that Rong Kee's goods were consigned by them. The anti-smuggling bureau believes that this case is of great importance and does not dare to make a decision on the requests of both parties. They have sent an urgent telegram to Guangdong Province to severely punish them. (18th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Security Team to be Inspected</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Security Department previously received an order from the General Headquarters to send an inspection officer to Jiangsu and instructed all subordinates to be informed. It is now learned that the 12th Security Brigade of this county has been ordered by the training officer to be inspected for four days starting on the 26th. The General Headquarters has appointed Lieutenant General Yang Jingzhi, Major General Meng Zhi, and the Security Department has appointed Lieutenant Colonel Yu Kechang and Shao Bi as inspection committee members, who are to conduct the ceremony in accordance with army etiquette. The brigade has ordered its subordinates to comply.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Langfu Ferry Now Open to Night Navigation</h3>
<p>The river surface between Nantong and Changshu is very wide, but there are many hidden shoals, especially the Baimao shoal, which is very dangerous. Vessels traveling to and from must use Langshan in northern Jiangsu and Fushan in southern Jiangsu as landmarks. This section of the river is called Langfu Ferry. In order to facilitate night navigation, the Jianghai Customs has set up light buoys in the waterways around Qingda Reef. From now on, all upstream and downstream vessels can navigate day and night.</p>
<p>Student Parade and Demonstration Incident</p>
<p>More than 2,000 male and female students from secondary schools and above in Nantong gathered on the morning of the 23rd for a parade and demonstration. At 11:00 a.m., they marched to the Provincial Nantong Middle School and demanded that all students of the school join them. A conflict broke out with Principal Yang Cuiyi, resulting in the destruction of the school's auditorium, principal's office, and teaching affairs office. Tongzhong has filed a lawsuit with the court.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Nanyu Section Determined to be Completed by the End of the Year</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony for the Nanyu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been decided to be held on January 15, 1936, and Deputy Director Hou Jiayuan has been appointed to be responsible for the preparations. It is now learned that the construction of the two major bridges, Guixi and Liangjiadu, must be completed by the end of the year. The test run period will be extended to New Year's Day, and the official operation will be around January 10. The Kaiping section of the project will be continued by the bureau, and an order will be issued within days.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Bandits Rob Fish Pond at Night</h3>
<p>Miaohugang, Qiujiang Township, outside the East Gate of Xiaoshan, is about five li long and has always been used by the Chen family to raise fresh fish, paying donations and taxes every year. Now that the end of the year is approaching, they are planning to catch the fish, but on the night of the 22nd, around the third watch, twenty or thirty strong bandits suddenly arrived, wielding guns and carrying out a large-scale robbery. The bandits fired shots everywhere to show their strength, so the fish farm manager, Du, fled and hid quickly. The bandits captured fish for about two hours before carrying away more than 8,000 catties of fresh fish, shouting as they headed towards Shaoxing. The owner of the pond has already reported to the county government's public security authorities and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>A Brief Explanation of the Structure and Function of the Human Body by Professor Sun Zongpeng of National Central University (Continued)</h3>
<p>(VI) The Respiratory System</p>
<p>The function of the respiratory system is to exhale stale air and inhale fresh air to provide the oxygen needed by the body's cells. The nasal cavity and oral cavity are the main passages for breathing, and the lungs are the important organs for breathing. The larynx and trachea communicate with the oral cavity. Inside the larynx is the vocal cord, which is used to produce sound. The larynx and trachea are both composed of cartilage. The trachea runs down the neck from the larynx and divides into two branches to enter the lungs. Each branch divides into countless small branches, and each small branch divides and subdivides until it becomes a small air sac at the end of the branch. The lungs are divided into left and right parts, and each part is further divided into several small chambers. Therefore, the lungs have a spongy shape and can expand and contract. Breathing is carried out by this movement. The two main branches divided from the trachea enter the left and right parts of the lungs respectively. The small air sacs at the ends of the smallest branches are located in the small chambers of the lungs. This is where the inhaled air and the gases in the blood are exchanged. Under normal circumstances, what is exhaled is that, except for the equal amounts of nitrogen exhaled and inhaled, there is more oxygen inhaled and less carbon dioxide, and more carbon dioxide exhaled and less oxygen. Therefore, it is beneficial to breathe more fresh air for the health of the body.</p>
<p>(VII) The Excretory System</p>
<p>The main organs of the excretory system are the kidneys, one on each side, located on the back of the abdominal cavity, on both sides of the spine, in a crescent shape. Each kidney has a tube that connects to the bladder. The structure of the kidney consists of the cortex on the outside and the medulla on the inside. The cortex is filled with Malpighian corpuscles, each of which has a small tube that connects to the medulla. The Malpighian corpuscle is a filter through which blood passes, and the liquid filtered out (urine) flows from the small tube to the medulla and then into the ureter directly to the bladder. The bladder is like a reservoir that, after a certain period of time, releases urine into the urethra and excretes it from the body.</p>
<p>In addition, the excretory organs also include the skin, which excretes sweat and oil in addition to gases. These are all secreted by glands. Tears are also excretory products and come from the lacrimal glands.</p>
<p>(VIII) The Reproductive System</p>
<p>Reproductive organs are divided into male and female. Male reproductive organs include the testes (testicles) and the vas deferens connected to the testes, the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and the penis. After sperm mature in the testes, they enter the vas deferens and are transported to the seminal vesicles. At the same time, the body of the vesicle secretes a mucus, which may be used to protect and nourish the sperm. When needed, the sperm is ejected through the penis.</p>
<p>Female reproductive organs include the ovaries and fallopian tubes. The fallopian tubes are not directly connected to the ovaries. After the egg matures, it breaks out of the nest and is pushed into the fallopian tube by the force of the follicular fluid. The lower part of the fallopian tube is called the uterus, and the opening to the outside is called the vagina. After the egg leaves the nest, a yellow spot appears on the ovary, called the corpus luteum, which has the function of internal secretion. If the egg is fertilized, the corpus luteum can inhibit menstruation and maintain the development of the fetus in the uterus, while making the nipples develop for breastfeeding. If the egg has no chance of being fertilized, the corpus luteum gradually degenerates.</p>
<p>(IX) Endocrine Organs</p>
<p>Internal secretion is a special chemical substance secreted by a specific organ and enters the blood to be distributed throughout the body. It can affect the development and physiology of other organs and is very important for the individual's psychological behavior. The organ that secretes this substance is called the endocrine organ, and the substance secreted is called a hormone. In anatomy, little attention is paid to it, but in physiology, it is highly valued. However, physiology is based on anatomy, so a brief description is given below. Anatomically speaking, endocrine organs can be divided into two major categories: ductless glands and duct glands. Ductless glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, thymus gland, adrenal gland, and spleen gland. Only the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal gland have internal secretion functions. The functions of the rest have not yet been proven. Duct endocrine glands include the pancreas (pancreas), liver, and male and female gonads, as well as their appendages. The important ones are briefly described below.</p>
<p>Thyroid Gland: Located below the larynx, on both sides of the trachea, one on each side, connected by a small band-shaped isthmus. Its shape is like a shield, so it is also called the shield-shaped gland. The hormone it secretes contains iodine and greatly affects the development of the body. If this gland is removed or naturally degenerates, the body's development will be incomplete, the hair will fall out, and the skin will be dry. The spirit will be weak and the temperature will be scattered, the movements will be clumsy, the bones will be underdeveloped, the libido will be degenerated, and the intelligence will be underdeveloped, eventually leading to death. If it secretes too much substance, the heartbeat will accelerate, the temperament will be dry, and it will be easily stimulated. In severe cases, there will be symptoms such as protruding eyeballs, enlarged glands, and goiter. This type of disease is generally more common in women than in men and can be treated.</p>
<p>Parathyroid Glands: The parathyroid glands are located within the thyroid gland, one pair on each side, and are quite small and milky white. The hormone they secrete greatly affects the calcification of bones, and its function is like vitamin "D" and ultraviolet rays. If this gland is removed or naturally degenerates, most people cannot survive. In mild cases, the muscles are rigid and cramping. The cartilage disease that occurs in children may be caused by a lack of this hormone, while adults rarely get this disease. If people with this disease are given parathyroid hormone or vitamin "D," they can regain their health, and ultraviolet rays have the same effect.</p>
<p>Adrenal Glands: The adrenal glands are located above the kidneys, hence the name. The inside is divided into two layers, called the cortex and the medulla. The secretions of the two parts are different. The cortex secretes "cortin," and the medulla secretes adrenal essence (this is the old name). Adrenal essence and the sympathetic nervous system have the same origin and have a stimulating effect, stimulating the contraction of smooth muscle and increasing blood pressure. It can also stimulate liver cells to increase the sugar in the liquid, so for those who suffer from diabetes, if too much pancreatic hormone is used, causing the sugar to decrease too much, causing danger, adrenal essence is used to save them. "Cortin" is an essential element for maintaining individual life. If the medulla of the gland is removed, it will not lead to death, but if the cortex is removed, no one can survive. In mild cases, "Addison's disease" will also occur. This gland is also greatly related to the occurrence of other parts of the human body, such as the color of the skin and the development of libido, and it also has a mutually coexisting relationship with other endocrine organs.</p>
<p>Pituitary Gland: The pituitary gland is located below the brain, hence the name. It is divided into three parts: anterior, middle, and posterior. The posterior part is composed of nerve tissue. Scholars in the past paid much attention to the substance it secretes, but according to recent test results, it has no other function except to increase blood pressure and contract smooth muscle. The middle part is located between the anterior and posterior parts, and its function has not yet been proven. Its anterior part is composed of the inner cortex of the mouth and has recently attracted the attention of biologists and physicians. If it is removed, the body will be short and the organs of libido will not develop, but their daily life will be like that of ordinary people. If it secretes too much, the opposite is true. The body will develop more than ordinary people, and the fingers, lips, and nose will be in a special state. Over time, it will become hunchbacked, the movements will be slow, and fatigue will be felt from time to time. There are currently about fourteen types of substances secreted by the anterior part of the pituitary gland, but only a few have been proven by experiments. The most reliable one is the hormone of sex, which can stimulate the development of the ovaries in the female body. Others that are currently being experimented on are the hormone of growth and the hormone of hair growth. No reports have yet been heard on the others.</p>
<p>Pancreas: The pancreas is narrow and long in shape. The middle part is attached to the small intestine, and the anterior and posterior parts float in the intestinal mesentery. In addition to secreting digestive enzymes, its internal secretion substance is pancreatic hormone, called "insulin," which is closely related to sugar metabolism. If it is removed, the liver will lose its function of forming liver powder, and the sugar in the blood will increase, resulting in diabetes. Therefore, pancreatic hormone is used to treat diabetes and is quite effective, and it has the same function as adrenal essence.</p>
<p>Gonads: Gonads are divided into two types, male and female. Male glands secrete male hormones to stimulate male organs and secondary sexual characteristics. If they are removed, men will be in a female state, with gentle emotions, sharp voices, and no testicles. The so-called theory of sexual inversion is due to this. If the elderly are weak, it can be said that they are rejuvenating.</p>
<p>The organs that secrete female hormones are the ovaries and placenta, etc. Female hormones have the function of stimulating the development of the ovaries and eggs, and regulating menstruation. As mentioned above, the sexual hormones of the pituitary gland and the hormones of the corpus luteum stimulate the development of the breast and maintain the fetus by stopping menstruation.</p>
<p>Liver: The liver is located in the upper part of the abdominal cavity and is the largest of the glands. In addition to performing digestive functions, it is closely related to anemia. People with anemia can increase hemoglobin and red blood cells by eating liver or liver essence. For this reason, it is also classified as an endocrine organ.</p>
<p>The scope of endocrinology is extremely large and extremely complex, and further efforts are needed to advance it. (The End)</p>

<h3>Over Two Thousand Students Petition in the Capital, Departing from the North Station Yesterday, Leaving at 5 PM, Stopped at Qingyang Port, Telegraphed Lin and Chiang for Permission, Chiang Advised Students to Return to School, University President Resigned, Partial Martial Law in the City</h3>
<p>The Fudan University students and others who formed a petition delegation to the capital arrived at the North Station the day before yesterday. They planned to take a train to the capital to petition, but the railway bureau did not allow the train to depart, resulting in a stalemate. The petitioning students remained on the first and second platforms. Yesterday morning, over one thousand students from Tongji University, Southeast Medical College, Jianguo Middle School, Zhengfeng Middle School, Guanghua Middle School, Daxia University, Shibei Middle School, and Huanghuagang Middle School, and more than ten other schools, marched in formation to the North Station to participate. The total number of people was estimated to be over two thousand. However, the railway bureau only agreed to transport the petitioning students to the capital at 5:20 PM. A large number of armed security teams accompanied the train to maintain order. It was reported that when the train arrived at Qingyang Port Station, all students were persuaded to get off the train and were escorted back to Shanghai by the security team. The details of the events are recorded below.</p>
<p>Participating Students Numbered Over Three Thousand</p>
<p>According to reports from the student side, the students who took the train to petition yesterday included 1,000 from Fudan and the Experimental Middle School, 100 from Jinan University, 200 from Xinya Middle School, 600 from Tongji University, 300 from Tongji Advanced Vocational School, 300 from Jianguo Middle School, 200 from Southeast Medical College, 100 from Southeast Physical Education College, 200 from Zhengfeng College, 100 from Wuling Middle School, 200 from Shibei Middle School, 26 from Huanghua Elementary School, 100 from Guangxia Middle School, 120 from China Medical College, 50 from Daxia University, and 50 from Shanghai Law School, totaling over 3,000 people. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegraphing Lin and Chiang for Permission to Go to the Capital</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Fudan University students sent a special express telegram to Chairman Lin of the National Government and Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan at 8 PM the day before yesterday, requesting them to order the railway station to dispatch a train and allow them to proceed. The original text of the telegram is recorded below: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government and Premier Chiang: Over eight hundred students of our school are determined to come to the capital to petition and are now camping overnight at the North Station. We earnestly request the Ministry of Railways to order the railway station to dispatch a train and allow us to proceed. This would be a great kindness. Shanghai Fudan University Student Petition Delegation, weeping and bowing."</p>
<p>Premier Chiang Advises Students to Return to School</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanjing states: "To the students at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station: The government is very willing to listen to your opinions. It has already ordered the Ministry of Education to convene representatives from various schools in the capital at a set time to meet. If the students have any opinions, they can be conveyed through their representatives. It is imperative that they return to school immediately to study. In addition to instructing the Ministry of Education to send personnel to inform them of this, I am also sending this telegram. Respectfully, Chiang Chung-cheng, Premier of the Executive Yuan."</p>
<p>Departure from Southeast Hospital Blocked</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after receiving an urgent message from Fudan the day before yesterday, more than one hundred students from Zhenru Southeast Medical College, after completing preparations, set off from the school at 1:30 AM that night. When they arrived at the intersection of Jiaotong Road and Zhongshan Road, they were stopped by more than eighty traffic police officers. Because persuasion was ineffective, a portion of fifty or sixty people still arrived at the North Station at 3:30 AM and joined the Fudan students.</p>
<p>Central Government's Comfort Has No Effect</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after receiving a telegram from Mayor Wu reporting the Fudan student petition, Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan replied by telegram the day before yesterday at midnight, ordering Fudan University President Li Denghui to offer comfort and persuade them to return, with extremely tactful wording. After consulting with the authorities, President Li, along with Secretary-General Yu Tongyin and Director of the Education Department Zhang Yousan, took the telegram, had the transcribed telegram posted on the carriages, and went to each of the carriages where the students were staying to explain in detail and urge them to return to school, informing them that Premier Chiang's telegram reply was extremely satisfactory, that the student petition had come to a result, and that they should not waste their studies, urging them to all return to school. While speaking, tears welled up in his eyes. The students were quite moved and shouted slogans in support of President Li, asking President Li to return to school. Seeing that things had come to this point, Li and Secretary-General Jin and others took a car back to the school to discuss the aftermath.</p>
<p>Li Denghui Angrily Submits His Resignation</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Fudan University President Li Denghui, after failing to persuade the students the night before last at about 12 o'clock, returned to the school and said to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter at the North Station, "Fudan has a long history of ten years, and its alumni are all over the country. I have devoted my life to Fudan's affairs. I love the country, but I also love Fudan. To save the country, there must be a whole plan before it can be gradually realized. Now, the students of Fudan do not listen to persuasion and rashly insist on going to the capital to petition, I am afraid that it will be difficult to have results. Therefore, I have repeatedly persuaded them and sincerely met with all the students, but there was no response. Fudan is my second life. I cannot bear to see the students waste their studies and squander their time. I cannot be responsible for this kind of extraordinary action and the future situation. Therefore, I decided to resign immediately and abandon all responsibilities of Fudan's affairs to promote the students' final awakening." Yesterday afternoon, a notice was issued, which stated, "This school's students, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, gathered several hundred people at the North Station on the morning of the 23rd to prepare to go to the capital to petition. However, because the train could not depart, the students were stranded at the station and insisted resolutely. I personally went to the station to persuade them to return to school, but it had no effect. Later in the evening, I received a telegram from Premier Chiang, expressing his willingness to accept the opinions of the students of this school. It was my intention that the students' purpose of going to the capital was simply to express public opinion and contribute opinions. Now that Premier Chiang has telegraphed his acceptance, the students really have no need to go to the capital again. Therefore, I took the telegram to the station and made a final effort to persuade the students, and read Premier Chiang's telegram to the public in each carriage, intending that the students would accept this reply as satisfactory. Who knew that after guiding them for a long time, there was no result. The students' persistence remained the same, and they turned a deaf ear to my words. I have been serving this school for thirty years, and when this major event occurred, I could not lead the students to be convinced, which shows that my usual virtues have not been trusted and my training has been ineffective. I feel deeply guilty. Therefore, from today, I have decided to resign. In addition to having requested the school board to hire a successor, I hereby announce this. Li Denghui." Upon hearing the news, the Fudan Alumni Association believed that Li had presided over the alma mater for many years and his merits were all there, so how could they allow him to retreat? They immediately appointed Xi Yushu and Ye Bingfu as representatives to earnestly persuade President Li to stay.</p>
<p>Mayor Convenes Principals to Persuade Students to Stop</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that because a small number of Fudan University students occupied the North Railway Station on the 22nd, obstructing railway traffic, although the authorities persuaded them to no avail, which was sufficient to disturb public security, Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city observed that their actions clearly had other backgrounds. It is rumored that the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party are using the opportunity to incite students and disrupt order. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, he convened the principals of major middle and high schools in the city, instructing them to do everything possible to persuade them to stop and avoid incidents, and maintain public security.</p>
<p>The Principals' Persuasion Still Has No Effect</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that at 2 PM yesterday, Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, Daxia University President Ou Yuanhuai, Law School President Chu Liangcheng, Dean Shen Junru, and Shanghai University President Liu Zhanen first gathered at Platform 5 of the North Railway Station to discuss how to dissuade the students from going to Beijing. As a result, they decided to do their best to dissuade them from going to Beijing and returning to school. They each sent representatives to persuade the students of their respective schools at about 4 PM, but to no effect.</p>
<p>Students of Chizhi Arrived at the Station and Immediately Returned</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports that over two hundred students of Chizhi College arrived at the station at 3 PM yesterday to comfort the petitioning students of various schools. The Dean of Education, He Shimei, rushed to the scene and addressed the students, saying, "Just now, I met with Director Cai of the Public Security Bureau and Director Yang of the Security Department. I express my deep sympathy for your patriotic actions. All requests are sincerely accepted. Please return to school with peace of mind." The students of the school immediately left the station, lined up and returned to school, shouting slogans in support of the Central Government along the way.</p>
<p>Final Solution: Decision to Depart by Train</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that at 4:30 PM yesterday, the municipal authorities decided to approve the students' request and ordered the station to depart by train to allow the students to go to Beijing to petition. At 4:40 PM, Director Cai Jinjun of the Public Security Bureau directed more than two hundred police officers, each holding bamboo poles, to spread out on the two platforms of the North Station, cutting off traffic on one side and broadcasting announcements on the North Station platform, telling the petitioning students in each car that the train was now determined to go to Nanjing, and that those who were willing could get on the train quickly, and those who were unwilling could get off the train and be escorted back to school by the security team, but they should not stop on the platform to avoid accidents. After twenty minutes of deployment, at 5:10 PM, each car officially departed. The two thousand petitioning students in the car were able to comply with the authorities' advice and got on the car one after another to petition in Beijing. When the train departed, they shouted slogans such as "Save the country and ask for advice". At the same time, there were large white cloth banners at the entrances of each platform in the station, which read: "Everyone pay attention, don't give the enemy a chance," "People who are really working hard to save the country should beware of the activities of thugs," and "Maintain the patriotic movement and strictly arrest the rioters."</p>
<p>The City Government Dispersed the Students: The Process</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the students of major middle and high schools in this city recently petitioned the municipal government in batches. Because the municipal government believed that their motives were initially pure and their patriotism was sincere, Mayor Wu met them openly and agreed to forward the various petitions to the Central Government. However, since the day before yesterday (25th) at noon, three hundred students from a part of Fudan University went to the North Station to take a train to Beijing to petition, the situation has gradually become serious. The Party and government authorities, in addition to sending personnel to various schools to dissuade other students from agreeing, have also repeatedly sent personnel to the North Station to persuade them to return to school, but to no effect. Later, Mayor Wu telegraphed Premier Chiang to ask for instructions. That night, Premier Chiang sent a reply telegram to Fudan University President Li, urging the students to return to school, with unusually sincere wording. However, the students were still not aware and stayed at the station and refused to leave, and beat several unarmed police officers who gave them well-intentioned advice, and distributed reactionary leaflets. Yesterday morning, a part of middle school students, who were very young, were used by others and gathered in the Continental Commercial Building on Nanjing Road, attempting to parade in the concession, and the leaflets they distributed also had a lot of reactionary colors. According to investigations, members of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party were directing and manipulating behind the scenes. Their plan was to use the students who were giving speeches to disrupt the autumn order in this city, block traffic in various places, and prepare to create a tragic case that could expand the storm, and even conspired to instigate a rush into the concession to create international disputes and increase the government's difficulties in dealing with it. The municipal government and the garrison headquarters, aware of this, must not allow the reactionary elements to take the opportunity to cause trouble, and for the sake of protecting young students, they notified the principals of various universities to go to the station at 2 PM to urge the students to return to school. Except for students from a few schools such as Chizhi University who followed the request to return to school, a part of the students from Fudan, Tongji, Jianguo Middle School, and Shibei Middle School, numbering several hundred, stayed at the station. However, the North Station was adjacent to the concession, and the crisis was latent, so an order was issued to equip locomotives to transport all these students to the suburbs and forcibly disband them. It is reported that the principals of various universities, in addition to urging the students who stayed at the school to follow Premier Chiang's order and send representatives to Beijing on the 15th of next month, do not need to petition again at this time, and will also send personnel to the suburbs to persuade the students of their respective schools to return to school. As for the middle schools, it is reported that the Municipal Education Bureau has received an order from the municipal government to inform all public and private middle schools in the city to start their winter vacation early from today, and parents are responsible for taking their students back to avoid being coerced and accidents. It is said that all middle schools will comply with this order today.</p>
<p>Arriving at Biaoyang Port, Various Schools Picked Them Up</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports that after the train left the North Station, it was reported that it arrived at Qingyang Port Station at 6:30 PM and stopped. Security teams and others also took two other trains to maintain order. The authorities of various universities rushed to persuade the students and prepared large cars to pick up the students of various schools separately.</p>
<p>Partial Martial Law Declared in the City</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Municipal Government issued a notice yesterday, which stated, "Notice: Student movements are originally patriotic and enthusiastic. Therefore, in recent days, the government authorities have been doing their best to maintain local order while seeking to protect young people. However, today, it was discovered that there are actually Communist Party members and other reactionary elements who are taking advantage of the student movement to carry out their plots of causing trouble and brewing disasters. The situation in this city is complicated. If we do not take strict precautions, accidents may occur at any time. In order to maintain the public security and local order of the city, we hereby announce partial martial law. In addition to issuing orders separately, we must immediately inform the public. This notice is hereby issued. Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai and Commander of the Songhu Garrison, December 24, 24th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Various Middle Schools Started Vacation Early</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the authorities earnestly persuaded and openly explained the patriotic movement of students in major middle and high schools in the city in recent days, they have all expressed their satisfaction and are studying as usual. However, yesterday, the authorities investigated and found that trouble makers mixed into the student ranks at the North Railway Station on Nanjing Road and the Zhabei Oriental Library, posing as students and distributing reactionary leaflets and slogans, plotting wrongdoing. The general young students, therefore, decided that the patriotic movement was originally out of a sacred patriotic psychology and would never be used by anyone. They were deeply afraid of being deceived by reactionary elements, so they automatically withdrew. The authorities are investigating the trouble makers who are trying to use the students to plot wrongdoing, and the Education Bureau of the car has ordered all middle schools in the city to start their vacation early and to inform the parents of each student to go to the school to pick them up to avoid being coerced and accidents. The authorities of various universities are now also studying effective measures to prevent any actions by reactionary elements.</p>
<p>The Boundary Road of Clone was Once Disturbed</p>
<p>The Public Concession Huishi Police Department, because the Boundary Road is only separated from this station by an iron fence, was deeply afraid of accidents, so the district chief Kang Chou dispatched the Huashi detectives Shang Wu and Tao Genrong, the Huabu head Xu Zhengqin, etc. to patrol the boundary road with Western detectives to maintain order. Fearing that the police force was insufficient, they transferred the reserve team members to patrol back and forth in two police cars. At 11:50 AM yesterday morning, two or three hundred students from Tongji University suddenly came out of the North Station to the Boundary Road, lined up and shouted slogans, planning to go to Clone Road and other places. The police officers closed the iron gate at the intersection of Clone Road and Boundary Road to prevent them from advancing, and the two police cars also rushed to the scene at this time. Later, senior police officers persuaded the students to obey the order and avoid accidents. The students also negotiated with the police through representatives for a long time, but there was no result. The representative then led all the students back to the North Station, and the situation calmed down.</p>
<p>Distributing Leaflets on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that at about 8 AM yesterday morning, about two hundred male and female students gathered at the Nanjing Road Ball Field, preparing to distribute leaflets. The Laozha Police Department and the Central Police Department received the news and prepared cars to intercept the Chinese and Western detectives to disperse them. A part of the students retreated to the nearby Continental Commercial Building and Shandong Road, Henan Road and other places. In the chaos, there were slight conflicts with each other. The Central Police Department and the Laozha Police Department captured eight students, a part of whom had been released earlier. The students were all wearing casual clothes. At about 9 AM, the students had completely dispersed and returned to normal. The leaflets and slogans left on the road were also cleared by the cleaners sent by the police department.</p>
<p>According to our newspaper's investigation, at 8:30 AM yesterday morning, the Central Police Department of the Public Concession suddenly received a secret report saying that a large number of students would go to Nanjing Road to distribute leaflets and give open-air speeches. After receiving the report, the police authorities were deeply afraid that the large number of people would affect public security, so they immediately selected Chinese and Western police chiefs to supervise a large team of detectives to rush to Nanjing Road to patrol and suppress them. They found no less than five or six hundred students and civilians gathered near the Continental Commercial Building at the intersection of Shandong Road. The students were distributing leaflets to the public. The police chiefs and others persuaded them tactfully, hoping that the public would disperse, but the persuaders despised them, so they immediately chased them away, and a conflict occurred. The Western police chief Hua Sheng was injured in the face, Feinas was injured in the arms and face, and in addition to Wei Situo's injuries on his face, his hat was also broken. Only Dong Chongxiang of Marilyn College was arrested on the spot. In addition, Zheng Shuwei, who was doing business at the exchange, was also arrested. Until 11 AM, the order at that place returned to normal. The arrested Dong and Zheng were sent to the First Special District Local Court at 12:30 PM and interrogated by Judge Dai Rongduo in the Second Court. The lawyer of the Bureau of Public Works prosecuted Dong and Zheng for obstructing official duties in violation of Articles 135 and 136 of the Criminal Law. The three Western police chiefs, Hua Sheng, Feinas, and Wei Situo, successively went to court to state the circumstances of the incident. Judge Dai then interrogated the two defendants, Dong and Zheng, and immediately announced the verdict in court, sentencing each to three months in prison, suspended for three years. During the appeal period, they should each pay a shop guarantee that they would be available on call. After the verdict, the police transferred the two to the bail office, and they could be free as soon as the bail formalities were completed. However, Zheng Shuwei seemed to have been slightly injured in the head during the conflict, so his head was wrapped in white cloth.</p>
<p>Students Parade in Nanshi and Zhabei</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that yesterday morning, students from Qingxin Middle School, Minli Middle School, Minli Girls' Middle School, Shanghai Girls' Middle School, Wuben Girls' Middle School, and Datong Attached Middle School in Nanshi responded to the students of Fudan University's request to go to Beijing to petition, and set off in teams from the school to parade and demonstrate along Zhonghua Road, Laoximen, Fangxie Road, and Chezhan Road, shouting patriotic slogans and distributing various leaflets along the way. In Zhabei, students from Aiguo Girls' Middle School, Yuqing Middle School, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teachers' College, Business College, Chizhi, and other schools gathered in teams on Jiangwan Road, Baoshan Road, and Datong Road, and paraded along Beisichuan Road in the concession. They also shouted slogans and distributed leaflets along the way. The order was still good, and fortunately no accidents occurred.</p>
<p>Representatives from All Circles Were Sent to Comfort the Students</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that from 10 PM the night before last to yesterday afternoon, the visitors from all walks of life to the North Station to comfort the students were endless. The schools included Datong, Chizhi, Daxia, Jinan, Jiaotong, Sino-French, China, Guanghua, and Shanghai Universities, Jianguo Middle School, Fudan Experimental Middle School, etc. The Fudan students who stayed at the school also sent more than thirty representatives yesterday morning, carrying bread and other comfort items, to the station to comfort the Fudan Alumni Association, which is a powerful organization of graduates of the school, and yesterday afternoon also sent representatives Ye Bingfu, Xi Yushu, Liu Bainian, Wang Sifang, and others to the station to comfort them, and urged them to go to school. In addition to the City Federation, there was also the National Products Manufacturers Association, which donated a large number of food products from various food companies to transport them to comfort the students. The National Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union sent representatives Lu Jingtu and others to sell dry food and fruit. All colleagues of Shanghai Zhengzhong Bookstore organized the "Zhengzhong Bookstore Shanghai Colleagues Save the Country Association" to implement the work of assisting students petitioning in Beijing, and raised 18 yuan on the spot, and appointed Song Jinren and others as representatives to purchase food and comfort them at the North Station. It was also reported that at about 5 PM yesterday afternoon, former Central Committee member He Xiangning also went to the station in her private capacity to comfort the students she knew well and encourage their patriotic movement. He's old and frail appearance attracted much attention.</p>
<p>In addition, the people of Zhonghua Jieyun Company opposite the North Station witnessed the students camping overnight at the station and specially bought a large basket of bread to send to them yesterday, and sent a letter saying, "Dear Sir/Madam, the colleagues of our company express our deep sympathy for your patriotic enthusiasm, and specially prepare a few snacks to relieve your hunger for camping overnight at the station and express our condolences. We wish you all to win glory for the Chinese nation."</p>
<h3>Shang Zhen Telegraphically Replied to the National Medical Association, Vowing Loyalty to Eliminate Traitors and Defend Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Medical Association telegraphed the responsible authorities to severely punish Yin Rugeng, a traitor who betrayed the country, for rebelling and changing. The reply telegram from Shang Zhen, former Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, has now been received. The two telegrams are transcribed below. The National Medical Association presented the responsible authorities' telegram (titles omitted) to the Ministry of Supervision: Yin Rugeng is depraved and ungrateful for the national favor. He does not know how to be loyal and uses the name to steal Jidong. He is more ambitious than a wolf and is not tolerated by national law. I implore you to quickly show the national power and immediately launch a crusade to punish this demon clown and prevent Yelang from becoming bigger. China is fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. Shang Zhen's reply telegram (titles omitted) to the telegram of the 6th has been received. The country is in difficulty, and the people are complaining. City foxes and temple rats are acting perversely. After reading your teachings, I feel the same anger. I, Shang Zhen, am in charge of Hebei and know the general meaning. I vow loyalty to eliminate traitors and defend soldiers. However, I have the heart to save the country, but I am unable to turn the tide. At this critical moment, I deeply feel the shame of being a single tree in a tall building. I have already telegraphed the Central Government to issue a main plan. If I cannot stop the tide, I dare to be ashamed of my position. I hereby report my sincerity and hope you will understand. Shang Zhen, Wen Shengji, etc.</p>

<h3>This City's Fourteen Legal Organizations Express Their Views on the Current Situation; Jointly Send a Telegram to the Central Government Offering Suggestions and a Separate Telegram Urging Song Zheyuan</h3>
<p>Fourteen legal organizations in this city, including the Lawyers Association, the National Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Journalists Association, believing that the situation in North China is severe and the nation's survival has reached a critical juncture, jointly sent telegrams to various departments of the Central Government yesterday, opposing the Hebei-Chahar autonomy, urging the swift suppression of rebels, and safeguarding legitimate patriotic movements. They also sent a separate telegram urging Song Zheyuan and expressing sympathy to the students in Peiping. The telegrams are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government, the Executive Committee of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Since the September 18th Incident, four years have passed. All of our people have endured pain and tears, understanding the government's difficult situation and hoping for self-reliance and revitalization. Self-reliance should mean safeguarding our unlost sovereignty and territory. If sovereignty is further divided and territory further trampled, it means watching the continuation of self-reliance be destroyed. Not only will limited sovereignty and territory fail to satisfy insatiable desires, but the content of self-reliance will also become weaker. If this is the case, how can we speak of self-reliance? Therefore, the current plan should be to swiftly punish those who harm the country and rebel, resolutely stop the Hebei-Chahar autonomy, and vigorously protect legitimate patriotic movements, so that treacherous elements dare not follow suit, and national strength will not be divided. Otherwise, those who follow the enemy will receive invisible rewards, and patriots will suffer tangible punishments. With rewards and punishments reversed, even if the government has no intention of harming the country, how can it defend against the fault of harming the country? The undersigned public organizations, with a sense of walking on thin ice and standing on the edge of a cliff, fulfill the responsibility of every citizen for the nation's rise and fall, and speak frankly. We hope you will listen attentively. (Signed: Shanghai Lawyers Association, National Federation of Commerce, Municipal Education Association, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Certified Public Accountants Association, Journalists Association, Municipal Farmers Association, Joint Association of Citizens of Special District One, Joint Association of Citizens of Special District Two, National Federation of New Pharmaceutical Industry, China Labor Association, National Postal Workers Union, China National Products Manufacturers Federation, Teachers Federation of Secondary Schools)</p>
<p>Telegram to Song Zheyuan, Chairman Song of the Hebei Provincial Government: Since the battles of Xifengkou and Shalukou, your name has resonated both domestically and internationally, adding glory to the history of national humiliation. This is why the people of the country have placed their hearts on you, hoping that you can do more in the future. But now, news reports indicate that you have shifted the blade of loyalty and bravery from Shalukou to the patriotic students. In that case, the commendable merits of defending the territory in the past will not only lose their value, but people may also suspect that you are using them as a tool for seeking personal glory. Whether to leave a good or bad name is your own choice, and there is no need for others to worry needlessly. However, out of love for you, we dare not remain silent. We sincerely hope that you will carefully consider history, punish the wicked, and clarify your ambitions, so as to comfort the hearts of those who love you and appease the anger and grief of the world. This would be most fortunate. (Signed as above)</p>
<p>Message of Sympathy to the Students Addressed to all students of Peking University, Yenching University, Peiping University, Chaoyang University, Tsinghua University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and the Peiping Normal University: Since the national crisis, the people of the country have understood the government's difficult situation, enduring pain and tears, waiting for self-improvement after enduring hardship. Now, four years have passed. You, compelled by accumulated grievances, are not afraid of blades and spears, using the sincerity of bare-handed entreaties to safeguard the integrity of the territory and sovereignty. Your hearts are extremely sincere, and your spirit is extremely strong. Upon hearing of this from afar, everyone is inspired. In addition to sending telegrams to the central government officials and Chairman Song of Hebei Province, we hereby express our sympathy. We hope that you will uphold your patriotic and fearless spirit, and strive for self-defense. We, though lacking in ability, pledge to be your strong backing. (Signed as above)</p>
<h3>Marine Engineers Association Sends a Public Telegram Urging Punishment of the Traitor Yin</h3>
<p>The China Marine Engineers Association issued a public telegram stating: To all newspaper offices: Recently, this association sent a telegram to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the National Government, and Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, stating: The traitor Yin Rugeng has usurped authority in eastern Hebei, presumptuously claiming autonomy, betraying our country, and undermining our unity. In broad daylight, he dares to engage in thieving and banditry. All of our citizens are filled with anger at the great harm he inflicts upon the people and grieve that the nation will be destroyed any day now. In recent days, representatives of students from across the country have petitioned and pleaded on their knees, all driven by patriotic fervor, unwilling to be slaves of a fallen nation. Our central government can no longer tolerate and appease him, allowing this traitor to be arrogant and conceited, foolishly seeking foreign aid and destroying his own country. Our government, to protect the nation and safeguard the lives of the people, should act swiftly and decisively. Your Excellency, in command of the military, is entrusted with the nation's fate. The insidious scheme to separate North China is a leading thread to our nation's downfall. Failure to remedy it quickly will be too late. We have heard that the central government already has a good plan for defending the country and a comprehensive plan. The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen. We hope that Your Excellency will reveal the details to dispel public doubts. Now, the national sentiment is erupting and cannot be suppressed. We share the determination to wipe out the enemy and the resolve to perish with them. The members of this association have participated in every revolution and will not shirk their responsibility. At this critical moment, we are willing to devote our utmost sincerity. Any orders you give, we will gladly follow. Everyone is of one mind in defending the country. We respectfully submit this for your kind consideration.</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed Ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, Departed Yesterday; He Published a Letter to the German People Before His Departure</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Cheng Tianfang, took the Jinghui ferry across the river from the Xinguanshi Wharf at 2:30 PM yesterday and boarded the Prussode Wheel of the North German Company. He set sail for his post abroad at around 4:00 PM. Those who came to see him off included Mr. Geng Jiaqi, representing Mayor Wu, Chairman Xu Shiying of the Disaster Relief Committee, Director Zhou Jue of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Director Zhao Tiezhang, Huang Yanpei, Wang Yunwu, the consuls of Germany and Austria in Shanghai, and many of Mr. Cheng's relatives and friends. Those who traveled with him included Embassy Secretary Qiu Changkang, Attaché Chen Zehua, and Clerk Mao Biping. Mr. Cheng's family will travel to Germany next spring. Mr. Strewe, the editor-in-chief of the German newspaper Deutsche Allgeine Zeitung, has worked in China for many years, has extensive knowledge of Chinese culture, and has always expressed sympathy for the Chinese nation. He often publishes articles in the newspaper praising China and upholding justice. In 1930, the German industrial inspection team that came to China was initiated by Mr. Strewe. He recently came to China for a visit and met with Mr. Cheng Tianfang, our country's first ambassador to Germany, in Beijing. They had a very pleasant conversation. Mr. Strewe specially requested Ambassador Cheng to write a short article on the day of his departure, which he would telegraph to Germany for publication in German newspapers. Mr. Cheng agreed to his request. The translated manuscript of the article is published below: Today is the eve of Christmas, and I am also departing for Germany today. At the request of Mr. Strewe, I respectfully address a few words to the German people as a Christmas gift. When I was a child, I knew that there was a German nation in the world, whose people were fond of learning and deep in thought, persevering and resolute. Therefore, their achievements in science, philosophy, engineering, industry, medicine, and art are admired and praised by the whole world. The rapid development of the German Empire was unprecedented in the history of the world. At that time, I was eager to set foot in Germany and see the facilities of this great nation. This wish has been cherished for twenty-five years, and today I am able to fulfill this hope as the first ambassador to Germany, which is the most honorable and joyful thing for me. After the Great War, Germany was in the most difficult and painful environment, but with the efforts and struggles of the German government and people, they overcame the environment and revived. China is also encountering an extremely difficult and painful environment. In the midst of our efforts and struggles, every time we think of the example of Germany's revival, we gain infinite courage. China and Germany have always had friendly relations. In recent years, the cooperation between the two countries in culture and economic development has been increasing, which will allow the people of the two countries to understand each other better and become more friendly. Jesus said, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Confucius also said, "Help others establish themselves, help others succeed." The teachings of Chinese and Western sages are the same. If the two great nations of China and Germany follow this spirit and engage in mutual assistance, they will make a great contribution to the world. I, Cheng Tianfang, am willing to do my best to contribute to this. Cheng Tianfang.</p>
<p>Those who accompanied Ambassador Cheng yesterday included Embassy Secretary Qiu Changkang, Attaché Chen Zehua, Clerk Mao Baoping, and Zhu Jianmin, Zhou Chixia, Xiao Zuoliang, and Si Songxi, graduates of the Department of Diplomacy of the Central Political School who went to Germany for internships, and a servant, a total of eight people. Embassy Secretary Li Weiguo in September and Yao Dingchen in November had already gone to Germany to arrange everything. As for Ambassador Cheng's wife and children, they will stay in China temporarily due to some matters and will go there next spring.</p>

In addition, seventeen companies were rejected for loans, either because their business did not conform to the loan principles, or because the use of the loan did not comply with the regulations, or because they lacked the required qualifications. The committee will notify the original applicants of the approved cases. In addition, members of the Noodle and Shoe Leather Nail Industry Associations have borrowed small amounts of less than 100 yuan from the Loan Committee, with joint guarantees from three companies in the same industry.

<h3>Director of Yunnan Finance Department, Lu Chongren, is Scheduled to Return to Yunnan Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Purchased many Zhongming-style wood charcoal-fueled oil substitute stoves in Shanghai. Lu Chongren, member of the Yunnan Provincial Government and Director of the Finance Department, went to Beijing to attend the Fifth National Congress.

He took advantage of his trip to Shanghai to visit the Zhongming Factory on Qiqihar Road in Yangshupu yesterday.

<h3>The Land Bureau Plans to Formulate Provisional Measures for Land Mortgage Rights; The Executive Yuan Orders Revisions to be Submitted for Review; The Judicial Yuan Must Reinterpret</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau previously explained that according to Interpretation No. 493 of the Judicial Yuan, the auction of collateral must be implemented after a court ruling is finalized. Therefore, mortgages are stagnant, which hinders the flow of funds. After Director Cai examined the social situation, he drafted nine articles of the Provisional Measures for Implementing Land License Mortgage Rights in Shanghai and submitted them to the municipal government for submission to the Executive Yuan for instructions. Regarding the creditor's application to auction rental guarantee objects, there is no need for a final judgment as an enforcement title, and it should be approved for auction. The Judicial Administration Department issued Order No. 2221 to its subordinate courts for compliance on June 30, 23rd. The Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 492 is currently being requested by the Executive Yuan for reinterpretation. The Land License Mortgage Rights Provisional Measures are now being revised in accordance with the regulations. It is learned that the original text of Instruction No. 16659 of the Municipal Government is as follows: A case was received from the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 3731, which stated: A submission of No. 493 on November 20, 24th, was submitted for the drafting of provisional measures for the implementation of land license mortgage rights in Shanghai, please review and order compliance. The submitted and attached documents have been fully understood. The proposed draft provisional measures for the implementation of land pledge rights in Shanghai contradicts the provisions of the Civil Code and should not be approved. It has been investigated that a creditor's application to auction collateral does not require a final judgment as an enforcement title, and it should be approved for auction. The Judicial Administration Department issued Instruction No. 2221 to the Jiangsu Higher Court and forwarded it to its subordinate courts for compliance on June 30, 23rd. In addition, the Municipal Council of Shanghai and others requested the Judicial Yuan to reinterpret Court Order No. 93 and requested the Legislative Yuan to promulgate the Registration Law and Auction Law as soon as possible to encourage real estate circulation and to provide relief to industry and commerce. It is necessary to revise and resubmit the report in accordance with the law for review and transfer. This order, etc., because of the previous instructions, should be reported to the Bureau for compliance and reported for review and transfer.</p>

<h3>Assault on Tram Conductor; Caused by Argument Over Forcing Purchase of Tickets; Conductor Mu Xiaoshan Severely Beaten; - The Troublemaking Members Have Been Sent to Court -</h3>
<p>Chen Huaxiang (24 years old, local, residing at No. 40 Luban Road, Huajie, works as an automobile coppersmith) and Chen Gensi (24 years old, local, residing in a bungalow without a number in the Lu Family Alley of Jaxi Road, French Concession, works as a painter) traveled together at 7:00 PM on the 21st, wearing uniforms. They boarded Tram No. 40 on Route 6 of the French Tram Company outside the Little North Gate of the French Concession, heading to Xieqiao. Chen et al. were on duty and patrolling at the corps headquarters. After boarding the tram, Chen et al. relied on wearing uniforms and refused to purchase tickets. Mu Xiaoshan, the conductor No. 218 (32 years old, Nanjing, residing at No. 6 Defengli, Xietu Road, Huajie), ordered Chen et al. to purchase tickets. Chen et al. refused, and the two sides began to argue. The tram traveled quickly and arrived at Xieqiao Station in the blink of an eye. The two Chens got off the tram angrily and gathered nearly ten colleagues, driving to Xujiahui Road on the border of the Chinese and French Concessions to wait for revenge. At 7:20, Tram No. 40 on Route 6 of the French Tram Company had turned around from the last stop of Luban Road, Lujiawan, Xujiahui Road and was heading to the 16th Pier. When it drove to the station at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Beile Road, the conductor got off the tram to signal with a red and green light, waiting to hand over the tram. Chen Huaxiang and Chen Genbin had gathered a crowd and rushed over. They boarded the tram without asking any questions and forcibly dragged conductor Mu Xiaoshan No. 218 off the tram, pulling him into the open space leveled on the bank of the Lujiabang River, between Xieshi Road and Xujiahui. Mu was pushed to the ground and beaten with fists and feet by many people. Some people held two pistols to watch out. At that time, Mu was kicked in the abdomen by leather shoes and stabbed in the abdomen and left corner of the head with the bayonet of the gun, suffering serious injuries and falling to the ground. When he was beaten, Mu shouted for help loudly. The patrol No. 87 of the Vietnamese police sent by the nearby French Police Station reported to the French Police Station by telephone. When the police station dispatched a large number of detectives to arrest the suspects, the perpetrators had scattered and fled. Only the victim, conductor Mu Xiaoshan No. 218, was seen lying on the ground seriously injured, with fresh blood gushing from the wounds. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital. The French Police Station reported to the French Consulate. It was found that the main culprits were Chen Huaxiang and Chen Gendou. They were detained in Qiaojiabang, Nanshi. The French Police Station notified the French Police Station on the afternoon of the next day. Detectives Zhou Buguang and Zhong Benchang et al. went to transfer the two Chens to their custody. Yesterday noon, they were sent to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, requesting that the defendants be detained, the investigation be rescheduled, the accomplices be arrested, and a lawsuit be filed. He also said that the victim was currently being treated in the hospital and was seriously injured, so he could not be present in court. Subsequently, detectives Zhou Buguang and Zhong Benchang et al. reported the details of the incident and the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. Judge Wang Gangxu reviewed the report and ordered the defendants to be questioned separately. Both Chens denied the charges, claiming that the assault was committed by comrades who went to seek revenge after hearing about our complaints. The court reviewed the confessions and ordered that the trial be rescheduled for further investigation. The defendants were returned to custody. A forensic doctor will be sent to the hospital with the police detectives to verify the victim's injuries.</p>
<h3>Female Gambling Boss Lu Laoqi's Trial Record; Murder Case Dropped Due to Lack of Evidence, Gambling Case Prosecuted Under Criminal Law</h3>
<p>Lu Laoqi, alias Wenying, 35 years old, local, the female gambling boss wanted by the police, previously opened a salted meat shop and brothel at No. 114 Aige Road. She was wanted by the Second Special Court at the request of the French Police Station for opening gambling games and inciting the assassination of Shao Wenbin, a fellow gambler. She had evaded arrest for two years. Until 9:00 PM on the 5th of this month, Lu went to No. 5 Yurenli, Yunnan Road, British Concession, where she was discovered by Qian Chenglong, an inspector of the French Police Station, who led detectives Zhang Ziying, Xie Guangming, and Wang Dongwan to arrest her with the assistance of the Old Zha Police Station. She was brought to the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo held two hearings. The case was reported to the police, and the case was postponed due to the incomplete investigation procedures of the French Police Department. Yesterday morning, the case was heard again. Since the original presiding judge Zhang Chaozuo was transferred to the Civil Division, Wang Gangxu, the chief of the Criminal Division, accompanied by clerk Gao Yanmao, came to the Criminal Division to interrogate her. Lu confessed her name as Wenying, her childhood name as Shicui, so people called her Aqi, 35 years old, from Nanxiang, residing at No. 55 Hu Family Pavilion, Fahua, her husband had died. At this point, Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, saying that the defendant's arrest warrant was signed by the court on November 7, 1932, and she was only arrested now. The defendant, together with Gao Lansheng, Mao Axiang, Shi Laohu, Qian Ajin, and other gambling offenders who had been arrested and punished, jointly organized a large gambling house, as evidenced by the confessions of Gu Gengsheng, Hua Amao, and others who had been arrested and punished. Regarding the suspicion of inciting murder, after the Police Department questioned Zhang Bingrong, the murderer in the Shao Wenbin case, there was no active evidence of criminal suspicion, so she was not prosecuted. She is now prosecuted for gambling under Article 268 of the Criminal Law. Lu confessed that when she opened the salted meat shop in March 1933, a guest named Xiao Pengtou came and said that he had opened a gambling den in the city, Chinese territory, and invited me to invest in shares, each share costing ten yuan. I did not agree to pay. Later, money was distributed to me. In mid-May, the police station found out and sent detectives to search my place, but they did not find any evidence. Later, the guest came again and was rejected. From then on, I closed the door (Han Zhuang) and moved elsewhere. The gambling den was not a large one. I met Mao Axiang at the age of nineteen, and his wife was my little sister. I did not know Gao Lansheng. I heard that he was a warehouse worker. At that time, I heard that the large gambling house was Gao Lansheng's. I did not know that Mao Axiang was running gambling games. The official asked if she knew the gambling offenders Gu Gengsheng and Hua Amao. She replied that she did not. The court reviewed the confessions and decided to reschedule the hearing for the 27th because the case still needed investigation. Lu also requested the court, saying that she had sores on her hands and had an old mother and children at home. Could she be allowed to post bail? Lu's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Ma Shouhua, also made a legal request for Lu to post bail on her behalf. The court ordered the defendant to postpone bail and return to the detention center.</p>

<h3>Please Return Managed Inheritance: Li Nongjiu Accuses His Biological Father; Mediation Fails at Special Second Court Yesterday; Father's Side Claims Managed Property Is Not as Much</h3>
<p>Li Nongjiu, a 37-year-old wealthy man from Anhui residing at No. 66 Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession, lives off rental properties. Recently, he, represented by lawyers Jiang Yiping and Hua Maosheng, filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against his father, Li Fengchi (nearly 70 years old, residing at No. 15 Dumei Villa, Dumei Road, a shareholder of Shanghai Xinhua Bank), seeking the return of inheritance. According to the petition, the respondent is the petitioner's biological father. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the petitioner was adopted by the late Madam Pan as the heir of his late uncle, Zijing Gong. All of Zijing Gong's property was managed by Madam Pan. After Madam Pan passed away last year, the respondent, using the excuse that the property was of great value and could lead to family disputes, took control of the entire property, valued at over 200,000, under the pretext of temporarily managing it. He claimed that once the funeral arrangements were completed, he would hand it over to the petitioner for self-management. The petitioner, out of filial piety, initially did not suspect any ulterior motives. However, the respondent, with ulterior motives, publicly stated that the property should be equally inherited by the petitioner and his half-sister, Zonghui, born to his stepmother, and refused to allow the petitioner to interfere in any way. Recently, he even instigated Zonghui to file a lawsuit with your court for property division, falsely claiming that the inherited property was only 40,000, which your court has already rejected and recorded. The petitioner requests that the respondent be summoned to court for mediation, ordering him to hand over all the property to the petitioner for management. The court, based on the petition, summoned both parties to court yesterday afternoon for mediation in the fourth courtroom, presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the petitioner's lawyer, Hua Maosheng, stated the petitioner's intention for mediation and presented a list of the property. The respondent's lawyer claimed that the property managed by the respondent was not as much as listed and opposed the mediation and handover. Judge Zhang, after reviewing the statements, concluded that mediation was not possible and declared the mediation unsuccessful, instructing a formal lawsuit to be filed according to the law, and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Today, Christmas is Celebrated Vigorously in Catholic Churches Throughout the City</h3>
<p>Christmas, one of the four major holidays of the Catholic Church, has been celebrated by Catholics around the world since Pope Julius I designated December 25th as the day for celebration in the fourth century. This morning at midnight, more than twenty Catholic churches throughout the city held midnight Mass. Believers flocked to nearby churches in the dark of night to participate in the service, commemorating the shepherds' eager visit upon Jesus' birth at midnight. The churches were decorated with nativity scenes in caves, illuminated by candles, with believers praying, chanting scriptures, and singing hymns, creating a lively atmosphere. Believers also fasted and prepared themselves the day before. As for drunken revelry and fictitious customs such as Santa Claus, they are all rejected by the Catholic Church. Instead, the church advocates charitable acts for children and the poor, in accordance with the Savior's doctrine of universal love. The Catholic Youth Association of Dongjiadu, Nanbu, held a carnival starting at 7:30 last night to celebrate the occasion.</p>
<h3>A Bathtub Can Drown People: A Bather Tragically Drowns in Daguan Garden on Xizang Road</h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, in the ordinary room of Daguan Garden Bathhouse at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Xizang Road, a middle-aged bather tragically drowned around 10 o'clock the night before.

The bathhouse reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station, who dispatched an ambulance to the hospital, but it was too late to save him.</p>
<h3>Zhuanqiao Civil Education Center Sends Letters to Farmers on Key Points for Raising and Caring for Draft Cattle</h3>
<p>The Zhuanqiao Civil Education Center in Shanghai County sent letters to farmers raising cattle in the district yesterday, stating: "Greetings, the proper raising and care of draft cattle are closely related to our well-being and the health of the cattle. Here are eight key points to pay attention to, please refer to them to improve the health of your cattle and increase their work efficiency." The eight key points are listed below:</p>
<p>"Love" Draft cattle are the farm's laborers and the farmer's assistants. We rely on them to share all the work in the fields, so the abundance of the harvest and the prosperity of the countryside are directly and indirectly related to them. This is a very important matter. Therefore, their health is the farmer's fortune, and their longevity is the farmer's welfare. Farmers should treat them as close friends and not as slaves.</p>
<p>"Feeding" In the spring, summer, and autumn when there is plenty of green grass, we can rely entirely on grazing to save on feed. In winter, when the grass is withered, we can feed them dry grass, such as rice straw and beanstalks. However, when work is busy, we should give them some refined food such as wheat bran and soybean cake, depending on the workload.</p>
<p>"Diet" The feed and drinking water for draft cattle must be clean and fresh. Add appropriate amounts of salt and charcoal at regular intervals. The feeding time should be fixed and unchanged. When changing feed, it should be done gradually and not too hastily.</p>
<p>"Brushing" Draft cattle often have sweat secretions and dirt clinging to their bodies, which not only hinders their bodily functions but also decomposes the dirt, irritating the skin and easily attracting diseases. Therefore, the body surface of draft cattle should be brushed daily to keep them clean and hygienic.</p>
<p>"Hoof Trimming" Draft cattle's hooves should be trimmed regularly and not allowed to grow excessively. If the hoof shape changes and the ability decreases, they should be trimmed regularly to maintain their health. Pay attention to cracks in the hoof surface and the blockage of debris on a daily basis.</p>
<p>"Comfort" Draft cattle cannot have a good life without a comfortable environment. Therefore, the cattle shed must be bright and have adequate sunlight every day. Manure and dirt must be cleaned up at any time to prevent accumulation. In addition, attention must be paid to air circulation and protection from wind and rain.</p>
<p>"Exercise" Draft cattle, especially in the cold winter, should have adequate exercise in open spaces every day. This is the secret to maintaining their health. If they are confined to the cattle shed all day, eating and doing nothing, even if they are well managed and fed well, their muscles will become weak, gradually losing their disease resistance and work efficiency.</p>
<p>"Disease" If draft cattle unfortunately experience abnormal conditions, such as dryness of the nasal mirror, cessation of rumination, vomiting, or diarrhea, a veterinarian should be called immediately for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<h3>Two Robbery Cases in Nanshi: One Thief and Stolen Gun Recovered</h3>
<p>A gray overcoat was stolen from the Mingxing Clothing Company on Ximen Fangxie Road. The patrolling police recovered a thief and the stolen gun. Property was stolen from Cai Yuji Woodenware Store on Minguo Road outside Lao Beimen, and the thieves escaped without a trace. The details of the incidents, as learned by a reporter from Guomin News Agency, are as follows:</p>
<p>One Thief Apprehended: Ma Miaogen, a 33-year-old from Pudong, residing at No. 199 Ximen Fangxie Road, owns the Mingxing Clothing Company. Around 8 o'clock yesterday morning, three robbers speaking the local dialect, wearing black long gowns and blue cloth long coats, arrived. One robber guarded the door, while two robbers broke into the store and, pretending to ask about the boss, pulled out guns and threatened the staff, including Wei Aisheng. They forcibly snatched a gray overcoat with blue satin lining, a small red silk cashmere cloak with white leather collar, and other items from the glass display window. Except for one robber who escaped through the back door by taking the night soil bucket, another robber fled out of the main gate. Just as Jin Fu, an apprentice from the upstairs leather box shop, shouted to catch the thief, Wu Kun, a patrolling officer from the Fangxie Road Post No. 10 of the West Fighting Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, heard the alarm and gave chase. In a desperate attempt to escape, the thief, heading north to south, threw away the stolen goods at the entrance of Yihe Lane and fled into the alley. As a result, Officer Wu bravely charged forward and apprehended the robber, Gu Caiming (30 years old) from Chongming, and recovered a No. 287 four-inch Browning pistol, a magazine, and six bullets. The stolen goods were transported, and the owner was brought to the bureau for interrogation. The bureau, in addition to returning the stolen goods to the owner, transferred the suspect Gu to the headquarters for legal proceedings and requested commendation for the brave officer who captured the thief to encourage others.</p>
<p>Woodenware Store: At the Cai Yuji Woodenware Store, No. 941 Minguo Road outside Lao Beimen, around 9 o'clock the night before, three robbers wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers and gray cloth long gowns, also speaking the local dialect, armed with weapons, went to the store to rob. One robber stood guard, while two robbers went straight to the third floor, searching and looting 200 yuan in national currency, two pairs of gold earrings, two gold bracelets, silver hairpins, silver necklaces, lockets, and other items of great value. After robbing, the three robbers took the stolen goods and fled in different directions. Afterwards, the store owner reported the robbery to the Lao Beimen Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation and pursuit of the stolen goods and criminals.</p>

<h3>Hu Wenhu Generously Donates Funds for the New Yongding Construction Association: Designates 20,000 Yuan to Set Up a People's School and Allocates 5,000 Yuan for Preparatory Expenses</h3>
<p>Yongding in western Fujian is located in the central area of Fujian and Guangdong. It has beautiful scenery and a flourishing culture. The people are hardworking and adventurous, and their footprints are all over domestic and foreign ports. Since the founding of the Republic of China, it has been repeatedly ravaged by bandits, resulting in the devastation of the people and the destruction of homes. The situation is tragic and unprecedented. The fellow villagers in various places abroad, aware of the devastation of their homeland, are considering ways to provide relief. When Mr. Hu Wenhu traveled north to Shanghai last year, the fellow villagers in Shanghai had a proposal to organize a hometown relief group. However, because Mr. Hu was in a hurry, it did not materialize. This year, Mr. Hu led the Malaysian Chinese athletes to participate in the National Games in Shanghai. The old ideas were brought up again, and they jointly initiated the organization of the New Yongding Construction Association. The founding meeting was held on November 7th at the auditorium of the Shanghai YMCA, and Mr. Hu was unanimously elected as the chairman. Mr. Lin Zhumin was entrusted to convey his enthusiasm. After the association was established, it drafted a plan, assigned staff, and established a general headquarters in Shanghai and branches in major commercial ports at home and abroad to actively carry out its work. The details have been reported in this newspaper for several times. It is now learned that the association received a letter from Chairman Hu the other day, expressing his enthusiastic support and generously agreeing to donate hundreds of thousands of yuan for construction funds, first allocating 20,000 yuan to run a people's school and 5,000 yuan for the association's expenses. It is reported that the association will immediately reply to Mr. Hu to express its gratitude and will convene a general meeting within days to discuss all the preparatory matters and send circulars to various branches to report the details, in order to realize the construction of New Yongding as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Dr. Wang Boqi: All Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Rice Merchants Association Advise Fellow Traders to Cancel Broadcasting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association has repeatedly received reports from a majority of member traders that several traders have recently used broadcasting methods to promote low prices, which is in conflict with trade regulations. Moreover, the prices are confused and inconsistent, and the advertised prices do not match the true market prices, making it difficult for outsiders to distinguish between truth and falsehood, disrupting market prices, and damaging credibility. The association convened a joint meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members and the directors and deputy directors of each district office the other day. It was decided that all executive and supervisory committee members would personally visit each rice shop that broadcasts to advise them to cancel broadcasting. Yesterday at 1:00 pm, the rice shops that broadcast were advised earnestly, and the reasons were explained in detail. The owners and managers of each rice shop understood the importance of the matter and agreed to cancel radio broadcasting immediately. They wrote voluntary letters of commitment, signed and sealed them, and handed them over to the committee members for preservation, to ensure compliance. In addition to the satisfactory results today, it was decided that if any unscrupulous traders imitate them in the future, the association will submit a request for severe sanctions in accordance with the four items of announcement decree No. 10897 of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<h3>Case of French Concession Detective Insulting a Legitimate Businessman Named Fan: Fellow Townsmen's Association Expresses Indignation; Sends Letter to Authorities Yesterday Demanding Strict Punishment</h3>
<p>Fan Tingzhang, a native of Zhenhai, and his cousin Fan Wenzhao, on the 6th of this month, were mediating a dispute between their younger sister Zhang Fan and a tenant Yu Xisheng, residing at No. 8 Youde Lane, Malong Road. French Concession detective Wang Dongming, without asking the reason, arrested the Fan brothers, handcuffed them, and sent them to the Lujiawan Police Station. After questioning and clarifying that they were not involved, they were advised to leave. The Fan brothers are legitimate businessmen and suffered this strange humiliation, which was difficult to bear. They hired lawyer Sun Zukang to file a private prosecution with the First Special District Court against detective Wang Dongming for illegally handcuffing them, obstructing their freedom, and publicly insulting them, and reported the matter to the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Association for assistance. It is reported that the members of the association were indignant upon hearing the complaint. Yesterday, they sent separate letters to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Second Special District Court and the Police Department of the French Concession Board of Works, demanding that the detective be strictly punished according to the law, to prevent illegal activities and protect human rights. The letter stated: "Greetings, according to a letter from our members Fan Tingzhang and Fan Wenzhao, Tingzhang and Wenzhao are legitimate businessmen, operating businesses and serving as managers. Zhang Fan, who resides at No. 8 Youde Lane, Malong Road, is Tingzhang's younger sister and Wenzhao's cousin. In March of this year, tenant Yu Xisheng rented the front building from her. Since moving in, he has been repeatedly investigated and searched by the police due to certain suspicions. On the 1st of this month, he was searched again. Although no contraband was found, Zhang Fan was greatly alarmed and had no choice but to negotiate with Yu Xisheng to move out. Not only did he refuse, but on the 6th of this month, he gathered his mother-in-law, wife, and brother-in-law Xiang Tianbao and others to use force, injuring Zhang Fan's niece, who was sent to the police station for punishment before returning home, making a big scene. Upon hearing the news, Tingzhang and Wenzhao, as relatives, went to mediate and saw Yu Xisheng and the hooligans he had summoned were arguing with Zhang Fan. Tingzhang and Wenzhao, fearing a major disaster, reported to the police and requested assistance. Unexpectedly, on the way, the defendant Wang Dongming suddenly appeared, claiming to be a detective sent by the police station to investigate. Without asking the reason, he disregarded the tenants who were arguing and handcuffed Tingzhang and Wenzhao, displaying great arrogance, as if they were thieves. Tingzhang and Wenzhao were shocked and did not know why they were being blamed. They told him the truth and showed him their name cards to prove their identity, but he not only did not understand but even used his fists and feet. Then, he dragged Tingzhang and Wenzhao to the Lujiawan Police Station. Along the way, they passed through the busy city, and onlookers were numerous. The humiliation suffered by Tingzhang and Wenzhao was unprecedented and caused them great pain. After arriving at the police station, after inquiring and clarifying that they were not involved, they were told to leave. Tingzhang and Wenzhao then questioned the police station, stating that they were the ones who came to the police station to report the incident, and were not present at the argument, nor were they caught in the act. The detective did not investigate and handcuffed and arrested them, which is clearly an abuse of power and a violation of the law. The police officers had no words to answer and only comforted them. It is thought that the freedom of action of the people should not be interfered with without legal grounds and unavoidable circumstances. This is the constitution of a civilized country. Although the Public Concession has special circumstances, the police's exercise of the power of arrest should also be within the scope of the law. Detective Wang Dongming, who serves in the police station, without asking the reason, arbitrarily arrested innocent businessmen, handcuffed and insulted them, deprived them of their freedom, and abused the law for personal gain. If he is not punished immediately, the residents of the concession will be in danger. In addition to filing a private prosecution with the court in accordance with the law, please uphold justice and provide assistance. The circumstances of the letter have been brought to the association. Check that Fan Tingzhang and Wenzhao are both legitimate businessmen, abiding by the law and known to all fellow villagers. Today, they were wantonly trampled on by the detective, and the members of our association are all indignant. In addition to writing to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, a special letter is sent to your Chief Inspector to investigate the matter thoroughly, first suspending the detective from his duties, and then transferring him to the court according to the law for punishment, to prevent illegal activities and protect human rights. Please enforce public punishment deeply. This is addressed to the Chief Inspector of the Police Department of the French Concession Board of Works. From Yu Hede, committee member of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Association.</p>

<h3>Coal and Stone Barge Association Requests Strict Investigation of Forced Registration; Separate Submissions to the Social Affairs, Public Safety, Public Works, and Finance Bureaus</h3>
<p>The Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association reported yesterday that hooligans in the Huangpu River area are forcing barge workers to register, hindering commercial transport. Separate submissions have been made to the Public Safety, Public Works, Social Affairs, and Finance Bureaus, stating: "According to a report from the North Baoshan Security Association boat company, barge No. 12481 was loading coal at the Dongjiadu North Wharf at approximately 10:00 AM on the 24th of this month when five or six hooligans suddenly jumped onto the coal barge. They reportedly demanded that the workers register. As the workers did not understand their intentions, they ignored them. Unexpectedly, the leader of the hooligans, surnamed Wang, ordered his men to beat a crew member (named A Zhang) and take him to the Zhuqing Teahouse in Dongjiadu, where he was detained. Such tyranny calls for relief." The association has previously received reports from member companies that unemployed hooligans in the Huangpu River area have been forcing barge workers to register, the reason for which is unknown. Now, they dare to use violent and coercive means against the crew, directly disrupting social order and indirectly hindering commercial transport. Therefore, we specifically submit this document to your bureaus for review and record, and request a swift investigation. We urge the arrest and punishment of such individuals to uphold national law and ensure the security of commercial transport.</p>

<h3>An Overview of the Shanghai Flour Industry (No. 7 in the Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</h3>
<p>— Edited by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>1.  The Rise and Fall of the Shanghai Flour Industry</p>
<p>In the past, traditional Chinese flour production relied on stone mills. In rural areas, farmers would often prepare their own mills and make flour themselves, while in towns there were so-called grinding shops. These grinding shops were a combination of shops and manual workshops, usually equipped with one, two, or three mills powered by livestock. In addition, in rural areas, there were also water mills that used the power of streams to turn the stone mills, which were widely used by farmers. However, all these traditional methods were far inferior to modern mechanical milling in terms of speed and the quality of the flour produced. Therefore, since the introduction of foreign flour and modern milling techniques into China, their position has gradually declined. Although water mills still exist today, they are no longer as important as they once were.</p>
<p>Shanghai, being the commercial hub of the country, was the first to see the import of foreign flour and the emergence of modern factories. The initial import of foreign flour by foreign merchants was to supplement food supplies, and they requested the Qing government to exempt import duties. In the 22nd year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign (1896), a German merchant came to Shanghai and established the Zengyu Flour Company (which closed down in 1926). They directly manufactured flour in China, using small carts to deliver the flour and encourage people to try it, marking the beginning of the modern flour manufacturing industry in China. In the 24th year of Guangxu's reign (1898), Chinese merchants followed suit and established the Fufeng Machinery Flour Company in Shanghai. Subsequently, many Chinese merchants joined the industry. The following table lists the companies established in Shanghai over the years:</p>
<p>Period of Establishment　Number of Establishments　Notes</p>
<p>Guangxu 22nd to 27th Year　Two　——</p>
<p>Guangxu 28th to 32nd Year　Four　——</p>
<p>Guangxu 33rd Year to Xuantong 3rd Year　Two　One was reorganized</p>
<p>Years 1 to 5 of the Republic of China　Nine</p>
<p>Years 6 to 10 of the Republic of China　Six　——</p>
<p>Years 10 to 15 of the Republic of China　Four　Three were reorganized</p>
<p>Years 16 to 20 of the Republic of China　One　——</p>
<p>Years 21 to 24 of the Republic of China　Zero　——</p>
<p>Note: This table is adapted from the Jiangsu Business Records.</p>
<p>From the table above, we can see that the most prosperous period for Shanghai's emerging national flour industry was between the 1st and 10th years of the Republic of China (1912-1921). Excluding the reorganized ones, there were as many as fourteen completely new establishments. The main reason for this was the outbreak of the European War in 1914, which lasted for five years. During this period, due to the inconvenience of maritime transport and the vast military needs of European and American countries, even self-sufficiency in food supplies was insufficient, let alone exports. As a result, China's flour industry rose rapidly, creating its golden age. However, after the end of the war, the objective situation changed immediately. Few new factories emerged; in fact, only two completely new establishments were founded between 1922 and 1931. At the same time, the signs of decline also began to appear. For example, Yufeng, established in the 30th year of Guangxu's reign (1904), Dayou, established in the 1st year of the Republic of China (1912), Xinchang, established in the 3rd year of the Republic of China (1914), Changfeng, established in the 5th year of the Republic of China (1916), and Yuanfeng, established in the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918), all declared bankruptcy around 1926. In 1931, after the "September 18th Incident," the following year saw the Battle of Shanghai. Simultaneously, domestic and international economic panics struck one after another, making the situation for Shanghai's flour industry even more unbearable. It is recalled that when the Battle of Shanghai broke out, the Wusong Flour Mill, established less than a year before, had all its factory buildings and machinery destroyed by fire, resulting in losses of over 200,000 yuan. Although the Zhonghua Fengji Flour Mill, located in Tanziwan, was spared, stray bullets still caused losses of tens of thousands. Other factories, such as Shenda in Nanshi, Fuxin north of the New Bridge, Yutong on Guangfu Road, and Xiangxin Lida in Caojiadu and Xiaoshadu, were either occupied by soldiers or used to store munitions. Although they did not suffer the devastation of gunfire, the losses they sustained were significant. As for the losses caused by the stagnation of business due to military reasons, they are difficult to calculate. In recent years, the economic panic has not yet been restored, the purchasing power of the people is weak, and the burden of taxes and levies is heavy. It is common to hear of Shanghai flour mills declaring closure or suspension of work. For example, Xiangxin Changji and Haifeng Xinji declared liquidation in May and June of last year, while Huafeng Xingji and Zhonghua Longji suspended work in March and October of this year. This month alone, Xinda and Xinji flour companies have also simultaneously announced their closure. Therefore, the future of the flour industry does not seem optimistic.</p>
<p>2.  The Actual Situation of Shanghai Flour Mills</p>
<p>As previously stated, Shanghai's flour industry is the largest in the country. According to the Shanghai Yearbook of 1935, its actual position is as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Number of Mills　Capital　Annual Flour Production</p>
<p>Shanghai　12　6,089,000 Yuan　29,720,000 Bags</p>
<p>National　66　14,552,000 Yuan　64,963,000 Bags</p>
<p>From the table above, we can observe that more than one-fifth of the country's machine-made flour mills are located in Shanghai, with Shanghai accounting for more than one-quarter of the total capital. Shanghai's annual flour production accounts for about two-fifths of the national total. This not only proves the importance of Shanghai's flour mills but also indicates the progress of production technology and the scale of production in Shanghai, as its number of mills accounts for only one-fifth of the total, while its output accounts for two-fifths.</p>
<p>Among the existing mills in Shanghai, the oldest is Fufeng, and the largest in scale are Fuxin and Maoxin. The organizational structure and production and sales of each are described below:</p>
<p>1.  Fufeng Machinery Flour Company: Located at Chedaijiao in the city, it was established in the 24th year of Guangxu's reign (1898). It is a limited liability company with a capital of one million yuan. The general manager is Mr. Sun Jun. The factory's machinery is comprised of 26 units made in America and 560 units made in England. On average, it can produce about 8.5 million bags of flour and 960,000 bags of bran per year. The brands include Blue and Red Bicycle (also known as Old Car Plate), Green Fort, Phoenix Playing with Peony, Green Double Fish, and Green Double Tiger. The Old Car Plate brand is the most expensive and sells well in Tianjin, Guangdong, and other areas. The bran is sold throughout the interior. The profits for the last three years are as follows: 258,267 yuan in 1932, 258,442 yuan in 1933, and 305,173 yuan in 1934, and the trend is continuing to increase. The Yutong Fufeng Company on Guangfu Road in Zhabei is also operated by the factory. It was leased from the late wealthy businessman Zhu Youhong on the Dragon Boat Festival in 1926. Yutong now has a capital of 500,000 yuan, with Sun Zhongli as the manager and Xue Qinzhou as the factory director. The machinery in the factory is made in America, with a total of 24 units. On average, it produces 164,000 bags of flour and 180,000 bags of bran per year. The brand name is the same as Fufeng's Old Car Plate, and the sales market is mainly Tianjin, followed by Shanghai. In addition, the Shanghai Pudong Warehouse is also operated by Fufeng Company. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Impact of the 1935-36 Basketball Rules on Basketball Training (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Ruby of the United States, Translated by Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>What impact will the new basketball rules have on coaches? Will currently effective offensive methods lose their effectiveness due to the changes in the rules? What kind of offensive and defensive strategies will succeed? All these questions are answered by Mr. J. Craig Ruby, the long-time head coach of the University of Illinois—Translator.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the National Basketball Coaches Association held in May of this year, Mr. Nat Holman of the City College of New York reported that the greatest difficulty for referees in the eastern states of the United States was the constant struggle for position between the pivot player and the opposing defender when the ball had not yet been passed to the pivot position. Sometimes, this struggle for position resembled a wrestling match. The Association passed Mr. Holman's proposal—that the three-second rule for the pivot player on the offensive side, whether he is holding the ball or not, should be effective—and recommended it to the National Basketball Committee (Note: This Committee is the highest organization that amends the basketball rules every year. The rules in our country are based on this). The Committee has incorporated this proposal into the 1935-36 rules.</p>
<p>The main point of this new rule is that "when a player on a team is controlling or has obtained the ball during the game, a player, whether he is holding the ball or not, must not remain in the free throw area for more than three seconds. When a player on one team passes the ball to another player, the ball is considered to be under the control of that team" (Note 1). This, of course, refers to when a player on the offensive side enters his free throw area, the three-second count immediately begins. If he receives the ball and dribbles it, he must also run out of the area within a one-second limit, otherwise his team will lose possession of the ball and be called out of bounds. If he shoots immediately after receiving the ball, the three-second count ends, because his team no longer controls the ball. When the ball bounces off the backboard, anyone can remain in that area at will.</p>
<p>This rule has a huge impact on the game. From now on, we will no longer see burly players standing in the free throw area, relying on their height and reach, and competing with defenders for unobstructed opportunities to receive the ball. In the future, if you still want to use a simple pivot offense, the player playing pivot must have good footwork and proper timing in order to receive the ball unimpeded. Figure 1 shows a style of action that is suitable for a pivot player. When No. 4 dribbles forward, pivot player No. 1 runs straight forward over the area, then turns back, pretending to run back, and then turns to the left and moves forward, calculating the time to receive the pass from No. 2. In the first place, number 2 has already received the ball passed by number 4. After No. 1 passes the ball to No. 2 (or No. 4), he must quickly run out of the free throw area, otherwise the three-second rule will cause his team to lose possession of the ball. If No. 2 receives the ball as shown in the figure, he must also run out of the area within three seconds.</p>
<p>Many coaches have asked about player No. 1, if he puts one foot outside the free throw line while the other foot is inside the area, and raises the foot inside the area every one or two seconds to avoid the three-second rule, is that legal? Or they ask if player No. 1 runs with one foot outside the line and one foot inside the free throw circle, is all the time considered to be within the three-second count? The explanation of the rule is as follows: "When team A gets the ball, one foot of A1 is inside the area, and as he rotates, he completely moves outside the area, and finally turns back into the area. According to the rules, if this entire action takes more than three seconds, it is a violation" (Note 2). Therefore, in the above situation, it is not legal.</p>
<p>Because the three-second rule is sufficient to affect the offensive methods of the pivot player, the defender guarding him must also change his strategy. Or the guard defending No. 1 in Figure 1 will adopt a position that hinders No. 1's movement. This will inevitably force player No. 1 to develop true footwork and proper timing. Or this new rule will only move the struggle for position between No. 1 and its guard from inside the free throw area to the outside of the area. If that is true, then this rule will hardly achieve its original purpose.</p>
<p>Assuming that this simple pivot offense can still be used freely under the implementation of this new rule, at least two currently well-known offenses</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>methods will be eliminated. Figure 2 shows a famous forward's exchange offense in front of the pivot player. No. 4 passes the ball to No. 1. When No. 3 passes in front of No. 1, No. 1 pretends to pass the ball to him, but in fact passes it to No. 2, who passes in front of him a second time. From repeated tests, from No. 1 entering the area until he passes it to No. 2 and he himself runs out of the area, or until No. 2 shoots, it takes more than three seconds.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the National Institute for Compilation and Translation Regarding Translated Terminology</h3>
<p>The recent progress of the National Institute for Compilation and Translation in its terminology translation work is as follows: Since Mr. Zuo Renxia, along with Mr. Zhao Yan, began compiling psychological terminology, progress has been very rapid. The complete standard psychological terminology has now been completed, totaling approximately three thousand terms, and has been printed. It will soon be distributed to domestic psychology experts to solicit opinions. The compilation of terminology for psychological instruments and equipment is now planned to begin, with an estimated three thousand terms. The first draft is expected to be completed in three months. The first ten parts of chemical engineering terminology have been distributed to relevant institutions and organizations to solicit opinions. Furthermore, the Chinese Institute of Chemical Engineers, the Chinese Chemical Society, and the Chinese Chemical Industry Association have each been requested to nominate six representatives to form a joint committee for chemical engineering terminology. The first draft has already been reviewed by experts, and over twenty copies have been returned. Recently, more than ten additional review copies have been returned. For electrical engineering terminology, Chairman Yun Yintang of the terminology review committee has been specially requested to send letters, stipulating that the ordinary and power sections of the terminology be reviewed by the end of January of next year, and that the telecommunications and electrochemistry sections be reviewed by the end of February. For mathematics terminology, printing will commence soon after the presentation of the partial publication. However, since the original manuscript was compiled based on academic disciplines, checking was quite inconvenient. Therefore, the Chinese Mathematical Society was consulted, and it was agreed that all terminology would be re-arranged alphabetically for ease of reference. This re-arrangement procedure is quite cumbersome, but is largely complete. After one more round of sorting and proofreading, it can be officially printed. The first draft of human anatomy terminology comprises 522 pages, with approximately six thousand terms. It has been distributed to the review committee members for review. Regarding botanical terminology, a total of 12,270 cards have been received from Mr. Wang Zengjia, sent from Peiping. They are currently being organized. The reviewed draft of geological terminology has been printed and distributed to committee members for a second review. For mineralogical terminology, both the first and revised proofs have been checked since typesetting began. The compilation of Chinese-Western indexes is currently being rushed.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province's Rural Education Experiment</h3>
<p>In order to effectively promote rural education in Shandong Province, the Shandong Provincial Rural Education Guidance Committee was organized last year to carry out a planned initiative. As a result, thirty counties in the province were designated as rural education experimental zones. In April of this year, the Shandong County Administration Construction Experimental Zone Administrative Commissioner's Office was established, designating fourteen counties in western Shandong as experimental zones for construction. To unify authority, the rural education experimental zones of Jining, Chengwu, Shanxian, Cao County, and others were transferred to the jurisdiction of the twenty-six counties, including Licheng. The experimental zone funding for each county comes from a portion of the county education funds and the county public education center operating expenses, as well as the funds of elementary schools within the central primary school district. The funding for the Linyi and Ziyang experimental zones is formed by the complete merger of the old experimental zone funding and the funding of the affiliated elementary school of the normal school. The funding for these two county zones is over ten thousand yuan. For the other experimental zones, the highest annual funding is 7,810 yuan (Zhangqiu) and the lowest is 1,626 yuan (Zou County). The work of the experimental zones begins with language education. Because the tradition of respecting teachers and valuing education still exists in rural areas, if schools can be managed effectively, it will promote farmers' faith and facilitate progress. Therefore, the initial work involves focusing on improving the central primary school where the office is located and promoting the central primary school's experience to other primary schools within the district and in rural society using effective methods. In terms of teaching, school education includes central primary schools, rural primary schools, short-term primary schools, public classes, and women's classes. Social education includes open-air schools, little teacher instruction, reading rooms, public libraries, lecture halls, wall newspapers, letter-writing and learning assistance centers, and mobile libraries. Secondly, recreational education is implemented, such as providing medical care through mobile medicine chests and establishing martial arts societies, which are very well-received by farmers. Next is livelihood education, which involves establishing small-scale farms, livestock farms, contracted farmland (experimental crops are mainly wheat and cotton), experimenting with the eradication of diseases and pests, establishing vocational training classes, promoting family side occupations, and cooperative enterprises. The best work of the rural education experimental zones in the past year in various counties of the province, in addition to running school education, has been to gradually set up rural undertakings and engage in the development of rural industries. There are five key steps for the future development of agricultural production in the twenty-fourth year: Investigate the types and quantities of various foreign goods imported into each experimental zone. Investigate the local specialties and products that can replace foreign goods within the zone, along with their quantities and sales methods. Conduct a detailed statistical analysis based on the investigation. Organize production and marketing cooperatives separately. Gather the investigative statistics from each experimental zone and contact banks for investment, in order to secure loans for the development of industries. The current work of each experimental zone is focused on diligently investigating and gathering statistics, while the future work will actively focus on cooperative organization and contacting the banking industry for investment.</p>

<h3>Little Men (1)(3)(4)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Nan then quickly turned around, re-tied himself, and began sewing energetically. Soon, Rob came along, and finding the new punishment amusing, he took a jump rope and tied himself to the other leg of the sofa. It was rare to see him so amiable and considerate.</p>
<p>"I got lost too, so I should be punished like Nan," he explained to his mother when she discovered the new offender.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you do deserve some punishment, because you knew it wasn't right to run so far away from the others."</p>
<p>"Nan went with me," Rob said, though willing to taste the new penalty, he was unwilling to share the blame.</p>
<p>"You didn't have to go. You have your own sense, even though you're still a little boy. You must always pay attention and listen to the command of your sense or conscience. So you must stay here until lunchtime, and discuss it with Nan. I trust that neither of you will untie yourselves without my permission."</p>
<p>"No, we won't," both said, feeling that it was a virtue to help Mrs. Jo punish themselves.</p>

<h3>Finance: General Disappointment Reported, Gold Price Drops Below 70 Yuan</h3>
<p>的回小十五元六 Final Trend Turns</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market reported general disappointment due to foreign banks' dissatisfaction and the apparent start of buyer disappointment. The Central Bank still had silver exports, and major players selling foreign exchange made it difficult to support the price, which fell below the 70 yuan mark. The final trend hovered. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets in England and the United States both contracted. Local sources said that the United States bought 10% of the supply, and the forward silver price in Montreux rose by half to 1.2 cents. Exchange rates contracted slightly, and the price of raw gold in London rose by half a penny. Public sentiment was still not very satisfied. Western newspapers reported that the Central Bank had a second batch of silver shipped to the United States yesterday, and that exchange positions should be adjusted. However, the Central Bank's posted prices showed no signs of contraction. Yesterday, both England and the United States remained flat, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The posted price of standard gold bars rose slightly to 247.3 yuan. Preliminary off-exchange trading opened at 85.6 yuan. Huixiang and Dadecheng both sold, causing the price to fall to 81.2 yuan. The morning opened lower, and the market was slightly erratic after the opening, initially falling and then rising. Unexpectedly, major players took advantage of the high price to sell aggressively, causing the price to fall below the 80 yuan mark. Chinese merchants tried hard to sell, and although banks bought, the gold market was still dominated by sellers. HSBC posted flat prices for both England and the United States, with little impact. However, there was still much maneuvering in the middle of the day. Ultimately, the supply from major players exceeded demand, and some stocks were released, causing the price to fall to 72.8 yuan. Banks took advantage of the low price to buy, managing to maintain a silver balance tax of 2.5%. This had little impact. Sellers continued to buy in, gradually pulling the price up, and the exchange market stabilized, leading to a rise. However, public sentiment had become empty, and there were still major players selling bars after the high price, continuing the selling trend. The market lacked support, and the afternoon session approached the 70 yuan mark. After the afternoon session, the off-exchange market fell below the 70 yuan mark. After the opening, major players continued to sell, and the price continued to fall. However, with the exchange market remaining flat, buyers took advantage of the low price to become active. Sellers who had profited in the morning closed their positions, and the price gradually rose above 70 yuan. After that, buying became increasingly active, and major players chased after purchases, causing the price to rise to above 76 yuan. Day traders were willing to sell at the high price, and latecomers also began to sell, gradually pushing the price down. The initial report of Indian silver fell by 12 annas, with some maneuvering in the middle. The final report of Indian silver was flat, showing some struggle. However, there were more short positions selling, and the price finally fell below 70 yuan. This was largely due to the Christmas holiday, with most trading being closed.

<p>Financial Clearing Significantly Less Than in Previous Years</p>
<p>The financial sector's year-end closing period is usually much busier than usual. This year is different. Most of the outstanding loans and debts have been settled due to market conditions. Those that remain outstanding are only a small number. All types of collateral loans have a limited term, and the amount due within the year is also limited, no more than three to four million. Other daily transactions will generally be settled by the Lunar New Year's Eve. Therefore, the clearing process has been relatively simple recently. The banks' various procedures are cleared either by the end of the year or by the Lunar New Year's Eve, depending on their circumstances. Therefore, although it is the end of the year, the market atmosphere is not tight. The market activity yesterday was also the same. Interbank lending rates remained at one-tenth (一角) in the morning and afternoon. Interbank draft transactions amounted to over 3.8 million in the morning and over 300,000 in new transactions. Afternoon transactions were over 100,000, and Small General Assembly (小總會) transactions were over 900,000. Banknote issuance was over 1.6 million and over 800,000 to other locations. Foreign collateral loan transactions took back over 900,000 and made over 1.7 million in new loans. Bank receipts: foreign banks received over 2.8 million in draft funds, over 3.3 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and miscellaneous funds, over 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 900,000 in special exchange funds. Chinese banks received over 2.7 million in draft funds, over 3.1 million in various goods, foreign exchange, tax, and miscellaneous funds, over 900,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 800,000 in special exchange funds. Japanese banks received over 1.8 million in draft funds, over 2.5 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and miscellaneous funds, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 700,000 in special exchange funds.

<h3>Securities: Bonds Only Bid for One-Month Term; Short Sellers Exert Pressure - Weakness Unlikely to Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange only bid for one-month bonds for January. December will be settled on the 26th and 27th. After the previous squeeze of long positions, the market felt discouraged. Short sellers took the opportunity to exert pressure, and the decline resumed. Although Fourty-three and others tried to buy back positions, the market remained weak and unlikely to improve due to uncertain investor sentiment. The market continued to shift with the environment. Yesterday's market: At the morning opening, prices of 79, 78, 54, 20, etc. were still selling aggressively. Although 43 and 32 tried to buy, supply still exceeded demand. The opening session resulted in a general decline of several jiao (角) to eight or nine jiao. Before the closing session, 43 and 21 tried to buy back positions, and the market improved temporarily. However, 22 passed at closure and 48 and others turned to be crowded again, causing the market to decline. Although long positions tried hard to support the market in the two afternoon sessions, they were unable to withstand the strong momentum of short positions and ended lower. Overall, the market prices fell across the board by several jiao. The total trading volume was 13,970,000 yuan. The high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>New York Auto Stocks Most Popular</p>

The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that RCA must stand trial. Small exchange stocks rose slightly. The market was mixed. Total daily trading volume was 1,910,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: This Month's Yarn and Cotton Arbitrage Entered – Forward Prices Fell with the Standard Margin</h3>
<p>After a sharp rise, the yarn market turned downward. The margin declined, and investor sentiment weakened. Buying was limited, leading to a reaction and decline. However, the amount absorbed by the financial sector remained unchanged, but a portion was released by the gold industry. This month was the last day. Most transactions were arbitrage-related, so even though deliveries were active, they were fully absorbed and arbitrated. The month-end closing price was 201 yuan, up 3.5 yuan from last month's 197.5 yuan. The yarn warehouse has accumulated over 18,000 bales of yarn.</p>
<p>Price Drops by Two Yuan and More: In the morning opening of the standard yarn market, the standard margin fell slightly due to the excessive rise the previous day. Investor sentiment weakened, and buyers were scarce. In the opening session, prices for all months fell by more than two yuan. There was no change in the second and third sessions. As a result, all months fell by 1.79 yuan to 2.9 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was flat. Later, the market turned slightly firmer due to the increase in the standard margin. In the second session, it was reported that current yarn transactions were not as strong as the previous day, and the atmosphere was relaxed. This month, the market was mainly supported by arbitrageurs. However, the market sentiment for distant months was ordinary. As a result, all months rose nearly 1.4 yuan and fell 0.1 to 0.3 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng (大豐) sold 600 bales, Hexing (合興) 700 bales, Shenji (愼記) 700 bales, Yida (頤大) 550 bales, Xincheng (信誠) 1600 bales, Xinhua (新華) 450 bales, Dafu (大孚) 850 bales, Changji (昶記) 500 bales, and Taichang (泰昌) 1150 bales.

<p>The cotton market declined reactively. Overseas, U.S. cotton showed mixed gains and losses, with minimal fluctuations, creating a stagnant situation. The local cotton market was affected by the decline in the gold market. This month was the last day. Delivery volume remained congested. The purchasers were also engaged in arbitrage. The closing price was 41.35 yuan, up 1.6 yuan from last month's 39.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Declined by Six or Seven Jiao: In the morning opening of the standard cotton market, U.S. cotton rose and fell between 2 and 7 points, Indian cotton showed mixed gains and losses, fluctuating between 0.025 and 1 rupee. Overseas silver forward prices were extended. The standard margin declined, and investor sentiment weakened. In the opening session, all months fell by five jiao. The second session rose slightly by 3. The closing price still fell. As a result, all months fell by 0.55 to 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening remained downward. This was because current cotton consumption was stagnant. Arbitrageurs took delivery this month, while the distant months were flat. Changhe (長和), a major bull, sold to close out their positions. Gengfeng (賡豐) aggressively bought to increase their positions. As a result, all months rose 0.3 yuan and fell 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price.

<p>U.S. Cotton Merchants Supplement Near Months and Sell Distant Months</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with gains of 2 to 7 points for all months. Market conditions were stagnant. Most activity involved shifting from near months to distant months. The December contract was quite strong. No delivery notices have been issued yet. Brokers and short positions were supplementing near months and selling October. There was not much arbitraging. Brokers had uncertain intentions. There were few new non-industry accounts. Generally speaking, it seemed that the market was waiting for developments in Washington. Finally, long positions closed out, and the market retraced. As a result, spot prices were unchanged, near months rose 1 to 7 points, and distant months fell 2 to 9 points. British cotton spot prices rose 3 points, and futures prices rose 3 to 4 points. The amounts sold by Indian cotton arbitrageurs and European exporters were absorbed by short covering. Raw cotton prices fell by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, Omra rose by 0.75 rupees, and White Rose Creek rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is left. (Telegraph dated 23rd)</p>
<p>Also, according to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for White Rose Creek cotton on the 24th was 228 rupees, down half a rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>A Bombay telegram dated the 23rd stated that the number of cotton bales exported from Rangoon last week was 125, all destined for Melbourne.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Long Positions Seek to Exit</h3>
<p>In the morning opening of the flour market, prices for all months initially appeared stable and then flat. Chicago wheat quotations were nearly 0.4 yuan, up 0.08 to 0.2 yuan, and Canadian prices were nearly 0.08 to 0.1 yuan. Therefore, at the initial opening, buyers were still active, with near and distant months up about 0.01 yuan. Later, as the closing approached, most customers with long positions closed out their positions, causing the market to weaken again. When the afternoon opening came, prices for all months actually declined step by step. This was because the end of the year was approaching, the situation was unstable, and market sentiment was weak. Many long positions unloaded their positions, causing prices to fall step by step, down 0.04 to 0.05 yuan from the previous day. Going forward, there shouldn't be a special change. December 25th is the Yunnan Restoration Republic Memorial Day, and the market will be closed for one day.</p>
<p>The wheat market was uniformly sluggish for all months. In the morning sessions, buying parties across all months were unloading because the closing was approaching, causing selling prices to fall 0.03 to 0.05 yuan from the previous day. When the afternoon session opened, trading had cleared, and transactions were slow. However, because of the turbulent situation, market affairs were mostly pessimistic, so trading was scarce, and prices also fell sharply. For example, prices for February and March actually fell about 0.1 yuan. Going forward, if the situation clears up, the market can safely pass the end of the year. Current wheat not opening at Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Rice Market Generally Stable</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 40 sources (totaling over 8,000 shi 石), mostly thin rice. Although the volume of thin rice purchased by wholesalers was around 4,000 bags, the price fell by a small tenth (一角) due to the Christmas holiday and related issues. As for retail sales, because stomach was agile, there was no entry or exit. Thick early rice and other japonica rice rose 0.05 yuan because the usual sales price was low. Du Yangjian (杜洋尖) didn't have ups or downs. Yinyuan (陰元) continued to have oversupply, slightly amended 0.05 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, few came from various rivers, approximately 37 or 38 sources. White japonica rice was cleared on the market, store sales and stacking houses became more activated, in addition to a tightened jiao (角). Early rice showed a little tightening trend. Thin rice was leveled for retail. Jin stomach was still agile. Market form slightly tightened. Yangbu tips continued to be retail dismantled, price had no ups or downs. Baiyuan (白元) was stabilized. For other items, prices held stable.</p>
<h3>Hakka Indica Rice Sales Active - 14-15,000 Bags Sold Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hakka indica rice market showed a slight turnaround. Although arrivals were strong, sales were more active yesterday. The newly arrived Wentai (溫台) rice was completely sold out, and 8,000 bags of Jiangxi rice were also traded. As the stomach was big, the market price immediately soared by 0.03 to 0.05 to 0.07 or 0.08 yuan. Overall, 8,000 bags of Gan (贛) rice, 3,770 bags of Wentai rice, 790 bags of Yong (甬) rice, and 500 bags each of Min (閩) rice and Beijing indica rice were sold. Foreign rice also opened, including 200 bags each of Siamese rice and Yuan (元) rice. The prices also rose slightly, all processed through. If sales are strong today and tomorrow, the market price may need to rise again step by step.</p>
<h3>Metals: Metals Already Showing Signs of Winding Down</h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, merchants return to their hometowns, and factories reduce work, all showing signs of winding down. The release of various metal products has also decreased significantly compared to before, so in recent days, the total trading volume in the city has decreased from 4,000 to 5,000 dan (擔) to 2,000 to 3,000 dan, and recently, market trading has only been 1,300 to 1,400 dan. The prices of various goods are declining due to industry colleagues eagerly trying to unload positions. The most severe declines were in bamboo-joint steel bars, British steel plates, East white iron, and new lead wire. Other products, such as I-beams, angle iron, and shear iron, are also struggling to maintain their prices.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Stepped Up by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli (綫粉干) has recently seen increased sales from local and inland merchants, leading to a gradual tightening of the market. The market price has risen by two yuan. Yesterday, the price of genuine Longkou vermicelli was 25 yuan. The production cost still requires more than 33 yuan per bag, plus all expenses, so it is not very profitable. The market outlook feels secure.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Rumors of Another Tax Increase on Foreign Sugar - Active Sugar Market Rises in Unison</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was tight, with the gradual increase not yet complete. The association's official price for 24th grade coarse granulated white spot was 22.5 yuan, and the transshipment price was 7.4 yuan, both up 0.1 yuan, with a total of thousands of bags traded. Eastern red yell, original price not completed, transshipment yell 6.8 yuan. No. 8 East White yell was 22.2 yuan, and the transshipment YT mark was 7.3 yuan, with slight transactions. The price of No. 9 white yell was slightly loose, with a spot price of 21.9 yuan and a transshipment price of 7 yuan not completed. The local Mian Bai (綿白) Zhenji (振記) No. 1 was 21.5 yuan, up 0.2 yuan. Numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 were sold according to returns. A Chao firm (潮帮) opened more than a thousand wrapped red numbers, of which the goods were slightly high and low, and were valued at 13.4 yuan and exchanged for currency. Also, more than 200 bags of Huanggang Qing (黃崗靑) were valued higher at 10.5 yuan and set at 10.3 yuan. According to rumors, there will be another tax increase on foreign sugar on January 1, 1936, so the market trend is quite active.</p>

<h3>(Ji Yijie 紀一介)</h3>
<p>A Big Pile of Filth</p>
<p>The dates set for the mandated sanitation campaign by the department are May 15th and December 15th. On these days, local party and government agencies, together with the public, conduct a massive cleanup. Door-to-door sanitation inspections are also carried out, and schools even have sanitation propaganda teams. It would be appropriate for all filth to be swept away, and for every household to have a new atmosphere. Who knew that facts would be more convincing than words, and that things would be so completely different? Here, I can't help but think of a few words that the late Central Committee Member Mr. Wu Zhihui said in a speech at the Jiangsu Provincial Medical Administration College last year on "The Urgency of Public Health Construction." The old gentleman described, "A broken mat stuck in the corner of the door, serving as a breeding ground for bedbugs, a broken toilet bowl lid placed under the bed for display, the rope used to tie up ham still hanging high after the ham is eaten, for spiders to spin webs, and the space under the table and beside the bench, all turned into a display of broken shoes. If we inspect each household, we will surely discover a big pile of filth." These words, spoken frankly, are like a descriptive scene of a typical household. I excerpt them here to urge special attention from those conducting sanitation inspections.</p>
<h3>Winter Landscape</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian 周賢</p>
<p>The winter sun always faintly shines with a seemingly drowsy light. The withered black tree trunks face the howling seasonal winds, emitting the struggling sounds of strong resistance. One leaf, two leaves, the remaining leaves clinging to the tree, leisurely follow the wind, detaching from the tree and heading southeast. Turning in the wind, turning on the ground, they unfortunately fall into the same fate as the unfortunate group prostrate on the ground, subject to the ruthless trampling of humans, animals, and even insects. Unfortunate indeed, some even fall into mountain valleys, streams, or other inconceivable places, finding a sad and lonely ending forever forgotten by people.</p>
<p>In winter, rain visits the human world more frequently and abundantly than sunlight. The winter rain always falls like threads. All day, it is like being enveloped in the night. In the countryside, there is no crowing of roosters, no barking of dogs, no shouting of children, and no laughter of adults. All there is is a deathly silence. The mountains in the rain, the trees in the rain, the stone bridges, and the houses all stand quietly, standing in the deathly silent air. Sometimes, a small bird lost in the rain, breaking through the silence with its chirping, but it is very brief. The deathly silence conquers everything in the universe again.</p>
<p>In the city, there is no summer, but there is also no winter. The 1936-style cars always slide wildly on the smooth asphalt roads, in the intoxicating neon lights. The girls have forgotten the season, with their chests and legs bare inside and outside their clothes. Indeed, a spring-like smile always floats on the girls' faces. A "winter" character is faintly embellished on the sale flags and sale slogans. However, the majesty of winter can never defeat the electric heaters and radiators in the ivory tower.</p>
<p>Hmm, winter, although it can never invade the ivory tower, but outside of paradise, there are plenty of hells in this human world. Inside the grand hotel is a scene of spring, but separated by a layer of glass, it is filled with the miserable cries of cold and hunger. No, there are also disaster victims with half their bodies floating in the flood, their lives like one leaf, two leaves, the remaining leaves clinging to the tree.</p>
<p>Everything falls into a deathly atmosphere, except for the ivory tower in the city. - In this way, a powerful winter scene is displayed.</p>
<h3>The Toilet</h3>
<p>— Feng Moni 馮摩尼</p>
<p>A person certainly cannot live without eating, because without food, one cannot live, but; after eating, one must defecate. If one only eats and does not defecate, it will affect the body, and one cannot live. So, no matter who it is, one must eat, and one cannot avoid the trouble of defecating.</p>
<h3>Why Bother to Trap Oneself</h3>
<p>Because one must defecate after eating, the toilet is naturally indispensable; however, many people in society panic only about the problem of eating, and no one is anxious about defecating, perhaps because one can only defecate after eating.</p>
<p>It is said that: In the past, men or women defecated entirely in the public latrines in the neighborhood; however, it was somewhat awkward for women to go to the latrines. Later, someone finally came up with a toilet like a round stool, which was both elegant and comfortable, and one didn't have to run around; however, this toilet was intended for women, but when men saw this toilet, they were also unwilling to go to the latrines to defecate, because squatting on the latrine was very tiring. So, they also used the toilet. Until now, except for cases of sudden internal urgency that required a trip to the latrine, everyone else uses the toilet.</p>
<p>However, some people, once they sit on the toilet, are unwilling to stand up. They even sit for an extra moment. Sitting and reading the newspaper, puffing on a cigarette, is indeed a unique experience. Some people sit for several hours, feeling more and more interesting the longer they sit. Exactly what it tastes like, only friends who like to sit on the toilet know.</p>
<p>A person is never satisfied. Even with this extremely comfortable toilet, they are still not satisfied, so they want to use a flushing toilet. After defecating, there is no odor, and the filthy fecal liquid is not visible. However, flushing toilets are almost aristocratic. Only the wealthy can enjoy them; others still use this more common toilet.</p>
<p>I still remember when I was studying in a private school as a child, if I couldn't recite the book, the teacher's face, like that of an angry king, was really scary, so I would use the excuse of defecating to sit on the toilet and secretly look at the book, so as not to be reprimanded by the teacher.</p>
<p>The toilet room, filled with foul odor, can provide convenience to many students. I can't help but sigh, the function of the toilet is truly great.</p>
<h3>Reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas</h3>
<p>— Shu Fan 叔範</p>
<p>Flipping through the Bashe (巴蛇) illustration, the language is extremely absurd, with similar events. Because of concern for home and country, I don't know where the tears come from! I write a long poem, briefly imitating Tao Yuanming (陶泉明), but my emotions and grievances are different. The sea pavilion glares at everything in solitude, and the illustrations of the primordial wilderness are explained with clear eyes; the strange grief chokes the tongue as the snake swallows the elephant, and the story of magpies yielding nests is heartbreaking! The six realms never concerned themselves with tribulations, and the heavens never talked about kindness and revenge: there is a unique absurd pain in the human world, with no place to arrange the heads of brave men.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 22: Heroic Words Move Rosy Lips, Group of Sisters Gather to Discuss; False Affection Startles Jade Wrist, Bitter Woman Escapes Captivity</p>
<p>Looking from afar in Beihai, I could already see the change in Jia Duocai's face. I didn't understand the reason, but it seemed to relieve a great deal of suppressed anger, and I couldn't help but feel greatly relieved. After these madams entered the room, they began to make noises and argue. Finally, someone called out, "Let's not make a mess. Let Madam Liu and Mr. Jia speak first. If Madam Liu's words need supplementing, we can add a few words." Then, Madam Liu said, "Mr. Jia, I'll get straight to the point. We, these comrades, believe that spending one hundred and fifty yuan to buy a woman as a slave is not something that modern society can tolerate." Jia Duocai said, "How come you all still don't understand? I'm marrying her as a concubine, not buying her as a slave." Madam Liu said, "You're marrying her as a concubine? Where did you get married? Do you have a wife at home?" Jia Duocai said, "It's marrying her as a side wife. What wedding is needed?" Madam Liu said, "What is a side wife? We don't understand." Jia Duocai said, "Let me put it plainly, it's marrying her as a concubine. You think this is my fault. But there are too many people who marry concubines. Is it against the law for me, Jia, to marry a concubine?" Before he could finish the sentence "just a concubine," there was a sudden clatter of tables, chairs, teacups, and teapots. At the same time, the madams started shouting. Jia Duocai was so scared that he ran straight out, shouting, "You can hit and scold as you please, but if you break anything, I'm not afraid you won't pay for it!" With those words, he had already run out of the room, across the hall, and was standing in the corridor. Several of the madams had already followed him out and surrounded him. Jia Duocai looked at everyone and said, "Are you not being reasonable? I yielded to you in the room, which already shows my retreat. Why are you chasing me outside?" Madam Liu waved her hand and said, "Just come in. If the discussion isn't clear, there's still room for negotiation. Can you just run away?" (383)</p>
<p>Short Stories</p>
<h3>The Gifts Santa Claus Brings to Children</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Every year on December 25th, Santa Claus always brings gifts to children as usual. However, this year is a little different. He knows that this year is Children's Year, and the gift should not only be grander but also not be like in previous years, just using some shallow gifts of food and toys to fool the children. At least he has to choose something meaningful to give them.</p>
<p>He got up early this morning and saw that the weather was still clear, but the northwest wind was blowing really hard. So he put on that big red hood, tightened that half-new, half-old red woolen coat, carried a red cloth bundle, and strode out of his house, heading towards the world market.</p>
<p>"What kind of gifts should I buy to give them that would be suitable? Not food or toys, then I have to choose something practical and adaptable to the times..." He is a kind old man, so he is always thinking about the many lovely children in the world. He wants to make every child happy, and he often feels sorry for some poor children who are not happy, but he has no way to make them all equally happy!</p>
<p>The old man walked and thought all the way, but he couldn't think of what gifts he should buy that would benefit the children and that every child would need. He walked into the largest department store in the world market - the World Department Store - opened his eyes to look, and felt that the situation was a bit miserable - the first thing that caught his eye was some weapons for destroying the world and killing humans - guns, cannons, airplanes, warships, bombs, tanks, and many new scientific and chemical inventions that he had never seen before. In short, he couldn't name what these things were. However, he recognized the various masks hanging at the counter, but they were marked as being for adults, not toys for children to wear.</p>
<p>He looked everywhere and saw that none of these things were suitable as gifts for children today. So he went to the last counter to look. This place was very deserted. There were only a few clerks who seemed to be suffering from decadence lying on the counter, and there were no customers. Several kinds of goods were displayed, such as education, personality, effort, struggle, knowledge, courage, honesty, common sense, hygiene, sports, etc., but they were covered with dust, as if they hadn't been cleaned for a long time. He walked over to take a look and felt that these were the gifts he wanted to give to the children in his heart. He picked one up, blew off the dust, and looked at it carefully. But the two clerks were still cold, as if they were laughing at him for buying these things as gifts today as outdated. However, he finally bought each item, and even bought a big package.</p>
<p>Santa Claus carried a big package of gifts, happily walked out of the door of the World Department Store, and walked on the way home against the fierce northwest wind, preparing to distribute them one by one to those lovely children...</p>
<p>He walked on the road, and he seemed to see the smiling faces of a group of little angels!</p>
<h3>Notes on What Was Seen</h3>
<p>— (Yangzi Jiang)</p>
<p>Once, I passed by Jing'an Temple and saw two beggars begging for money from a Western gentleman on the sidewalk. The two beggars were a boy and a girl, both about fourteen or fifteen years old. They kept shouting:</p>
<p>"Master, Master, please do a good deed!"</p>
<p>Beggars exist in both Eastern and Western countries, so it is not surprising. However, it is really unnecessary to call a Westerner "Master." According to the recent Shanghai Old Shanghai Exhibition, in the late Qing Dynasty, foreigners had to call Chinese officials "Master" and refer to themselves as "barbarians." The current situation is exactly the opposite. Colonial slaves are always wild, so "barbarians" are actually ourselves. Those who used to call themselves "barbarians" are now respectfully called "Western Masters" by the moonlight.</p>
<p>Hearing the beggar children calling the Westerner "Master," I couldn't help but feel a sense of sorrow.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Christmas Demands Italy and Abyssinia to Ceasefire</h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>According to Havas Rome, 19th: "The Holy See intends to follow the example of the Bolivian-Paraguayan War in South America and demand that Italy and Abyssinia cease fighting on Christmas Day. However, it is doubtful whether this can be done. Regarding this matter, the Holy See has repeatedly consulted with the Italian government. However, due to the recent development of the situation on the African front, there is no possibility of a cessation of hostilities. It is feared that a large-scale battle will occur in the near future."</p>
<p>It is said that religions are mostly kind-hearted, so they oppose and obstruct all inhumane killings, abuses, or cruel acts of war. Therefore, not long ago, I heard of a so-called "World Peace Prayer Meeting" on the market. However, when I see the actions of religious figures, I am actually quite skeptical. After all, there has been the "Crusade" to the east in history, and recently there has been the expedition against Abyssinia starting from the holy city of Rome. Moreover, what can their so-called prayers for peace contribute to the reality today, when imperialists are drawing their swords and flexing their bows?…</p>
<p>This decision by the Roman Catholic Church to demand a ceasefire between Italy and Abyssinia is neither for the sake of maintaining peace nor does it explain that they are supporting the humanitarianism of religious figures. It is simply to embellish the birth of Jesus, hoping that Christmas will not be spent in the midst of bloody fighting and gunpowder. This can truly be said to be the most sincere face of religious figures: Jesus is loving (?), so there should indeed be no unseemly killing wars on Jesus' birthday. Moreover, can we cite the example of the Bolivian-Paraguayan War and the war between the Han-Zhi sects as examples of fulfilling such requests? Regardless of whether the Italian and Abyssinian authorities agree to the request or not, it is still unobjectionable for the Holy See to enjoy this sacred right.</p>
<h3>Donations</h3>
<p>— Yao Ying</p>
<p>I was calculating the payments for the upcoming solar New Year when Xiaoling rushed to my bedside, pulled open my mosquito net, grabbed the corner of the quilt with her right hand, and yanked it forcefully. Before I could ask a question, she had already opened her mouth:</p>
<p>"Dad! Dad! School will be dismissed tomorrow, and Pastor Lin told us to donate, any amount of money will do. It has to be given to the principal today, Dad! It's to buy toys for the poor children and let them see a movie. The teacher also said that whoever donates the most will be the first place, Dad! Can you donate two foreign coins? Dad! Dad!" I couldn't figure it out for a moment; it hadn't been many days since I donated one yuan for the flood relief, what were we donating for again?</p>
<p>"Well, well, well, Pastor Lin came to give a speech, teaching us to ask our dads to donate, donate to those little children who are suffering, who have no clothes to wear and nothing to eat, donate copper coins for them to buy toys, and also invite them to see a movie. Dad! Pastor Lin is an old man with a beard, he treats us very well, he brought a lot of candy yesterday, one bag for each person. He also calls us little friends, it's so funny." Xiaoling grinned, the kind of innocence revealed made me not have the courage to refuse him.</p>
<p>"Xiaoling, okay, okay, I'll give it to you tomorrow." I planned to think of another way, so as not to make him feel unhappy.</p>
<p>"Dad! It has to be today, tomorrow is dismissal." She said to Mom, "Mom! Dad! He won't give me the foreign coins." "Just give it to him! I've been sewing until dusk last night, I don't have a single penny."</p>
<p>"Go to the wallet and take a look." I spat out these words as if something was stuck in my throat. She lazily walked to the table, picked up the wallet, unbuttoned it, and poured out one silver coin and two jiaos onto the table. Xiaoling ran over and took them in her hand, and said to me again, "Dad, I need one more."</p>
<p>"Xiaoling, just take one, at school, they keep asking for donations, you can't keep donating without end." After being scolded by her mother, Xiaoling walked away in disappointment. I knew that the child was not satisfied, but how could I satisfy his desires? My gaze was seized by the calendar on the wall, the end of the year was already approaching!</p>

<h3>Dog</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>If a passerby asks for directions to the Zhu Country Gentleman's house, after telling them to cross the Huzhuang River Bridge, there is a black-painted gatehouse, and they never fail to mention the tall black dog in front of the gate, as tall as a stone lion. The black dog is the sign of the Zhu Country Gentleman's house. It spends all day squatting under the screen wall outside the black-painted gate, its pair of blue eyes vigilantly scrutinizing every traveler coming and going on the Huzhuang Bridge. When a regular visitor comes to visit the Country Gentleman, the black dog has already nimbly scurried into the gatehouse to tell the old gatekeeper, who has served the Zhu family for three generations. The old gatekeeper suffers from a chronic cough and relies on the history of his family serving for three generations to eat this ready-made meal in the Zhu mansion. The black dog was originally raised by the young master for hunting, but for the sake of the tenants, it also took on the job of the old gatekeeper's assistant, so the old gatekeeper loved it even more than the young master.</p>
<p>The black dog is said to be a wolf breed, with a wolf-like head, erect ears, and strong legs. After the Huzhuang Bridge is raised at night, it can scurry back and forth across the two-zhang-wide river. The purchase price was three hundred taels of silver, which was a much-talked-about story in this town at the time. The dog's appetite is even more astonishing, requiring five sheng of white rice and five catties of beef a day, which a young servant named A Gen is dedicated to providing. The black dog, having such a great history, has also solved a shocking and strange case, which is that it scurried up the roof and captured a robber. Therefore, when mentioning the Zhu Country Gentleman, no one dares to leave out the black dog.</p>
<p>This autumn, once, when the young master returned from hunting, the black dog suddenly disappeared. The young servant A Gen almost didn't eat or sleep for two days, searching in nearby towns. Later, an old man delivered it to the gate of the Zhu mansion, saying that the black dog was sleeping in his cattle pen. After the young master rewarded the old man, he ordered A Gen to chain the black dog with an iron chain. He no longer took the dog with him when hunting. But when the black dog saw the young master go out, it always barked and howled, jumping up as high as a person, and the iron chain seemed about to break. The Zhu Country Gentleman is quite superstitious. He thought that something unlucky was about to happen, so he still took it out when hunting, or even stopped hunting altogether, and let it guard the gate under the screen wall steadily. But the young master didn't listen to his father's words!</p>
<p>"Dad, don't worry. That dog is too sensitive. It can smell my scent from miles away. It follows me everywhere every day. Now that it's locked up, it naturally barks and jumps when it knows I'm going out. But if it disappears again like last time, not to mention the hundreds of taels of silver, you can't buy such a good dog for a while."</p>
<p>The father loves his son, so naturally he no longer pays attention to the dog. Moreover, the father has his own affairs to attend to. The young master still went out hunting every day, but he specially instructed the young servant A Gen to be wary of the black dog. The dog was chained beside the stone lion during the day and locked in A Gen's room at night. The old gatekeeper naturally grumbled, because he loved the dog, and after the dog was locked up, when he heard it shouting outside the long gate, he had to come out of the gatehouse with his cane, fearing that a distinguished guest would come to visit the Country Gentleman.</p>
<p>Despite such strict precautions, one morning it bit through the iron chain and disappeared again, but the young master who went out hunting was beaten and carried back in the afternoon, and the dog followed behind with its head drooping.</p>
<p>Since it was an affair in the Zhu Country Gentleman's house, the next day this news spread throughout the town.</p>
<p>It turned out that the young master had forcibly taken a married woman in a neighboring town. That day, the black dog howled loudly beside the woman's bamboo fence, attracting the attention of the neighbors, thus discovering the young master's affair and being beaten badly by them.</p>
<p>Although the Zhu Country Gentleman immediately called the local security chief to pay a sum of money, the news had spread everywhere like the wind. The Zhu Country Gentleman therefore vented his anger on the black dog, tied a stone to it, and sank it in the Huzhuang River, and the young servant A Gen also broke his rice bowl as a result.</p>
<h3>Sparrow</h3>
<p>— Man Yin</p>
<p>There is an unknown evergreen tree in the yard, it is an old tree of many years. This year, when renovating the courtyard, the family members ordered the craftsmen to kill it because it could not blossom and bear fruit, and its appearance was not very elegant (like a hunchbacked old man crouching in the corner of the wall, and a huge branch like Feilai Peak stood high outside the wall). I love flowers and trees very much. Although I have never grafted a flower or turned over a pot, I hope that flowers will bloom in the yard all year round. However, once winter comes, the yard is like a lonely cemetery. All kinds of flowers and plants that were once thriving have been moved into the flower room, and only that not very elegant evergreen tree stubbornly survives in the cold wind. In winter, being able to see a bit of verdant green can dispel the melancholy like gloomy days. That's why I opposed replacing that evergreen tree, so I changed it by cutting off that deformed giant branch and letting it crouch in the corner of the wall. It was then that I discovered a sparrow's nest securely built among the dense leaves. It is said that pigeons and magpies occupy nests, and sparrows are even more cowardly, hiding under people's eaves or among the tiles of ancient temples and deserted pagodas. The sparrow's nest on that evergreen tree, although far less neat and delicate than a swallow's nest, simply collects some fallen leaves and broken branches and builds a prototype at the intersection of the branches. But I think it's a miracle. Since I discovered this secret, I have stood in front of the window every day, like a philosophical researcher, examining the group of sparrows jumping in the yard and on the roof. After spending many days, I did not find anything special about that group of sparrows. They played all day and stole a little food around my house's chicken coop. I also visited their nest several times, but it was never completely repaired. Those fallen leaves and broken branches gradually rotted, and that prototype nest barely just waited for the branches to support it. After my research failed, I stopped paying attention to it. Recently, there was a mix of wind and snow, which broke off a branch, and the sparrow's nest was about to overturn. That group of sparrows all avoided coming to the front of the window. They were trembling and chirping, like a group of refugees. After a day and night, some of them even died of stiffness. Those who did not die were still trembling and chirping. My younger brother caught them one by one in birdcages, fed them rice and millet, and gave them clear water to drink. After hanging them in the house for less than half a day, they recovered their normal state and jumped and played in the cages. They forgot the horror of winter, forgot the pain of the overturned nest, or perhaps they were even singing the birdcage, the current place of comfort</p>
<p>There is a fable about bees and sparrows in elementary school textbooks: One winter, a sparrow borrowed grain from a bee, and the bee replied: "You play in the spring, play in the summer, play in the autumn. My grain is prepared for myself to spend the winter." Sparrows are lazy and procrastinating. I previously thought that it was my mistake that they could build nests. They cannot invade magpies' nests like doves, nor can they prepare for winter in advance and store grain. After the nest is overturned, they are still frozen to death if they live under other people's eaves. Well, these current birdcages, they naturally regard them as comfortable nests.

<h3>Song Introduction</h3>
<p>Remember My Love in the Xiang River Waves</p>
<p>At that time, I was drunk with a beautiful woman, the beauty's color was as delicate as a flower, today the beauty abandons me, in the brothel pearl curtain at the end of the sky, the beauty is like Chang'e in the moon, three or five, two eight, full and lacking. Green eyebrows like cicada wings, a life of separation, a heart broken from not seeing each other. Heart broken, I wake up with tears dripping into the Xiang River, the Xiang River is deep on both sides, the beauty is not seen, a sad heart, playing the lute with sorrow, the tune is high and the string breaks, no confidant, beauty oh beauty, I don't know if you are evening rain or morning clouds, thinking of you all night, plum blossoms bloom suddenly, I suddenly suspect it is you.</p>
<p>At that time, I was moored overseas, the beauty's appearance was as bright as a flower, at this moment, I return home to see the beauty, but the person is gone and the building is empty, tears like rain, the graceful beauty is gone, how can I not miss her? The pale white sleeves are so delicate, once gone, never to return, there's nothing I can do, there's nothing I can do, remembering you, I'm still drunk, singing the white-haired poem with sorrow, telling my confidant in the tune of the lute, beauty oh beauty, I don't know if you are evening rain or morning clouds, thinking of you all night, deep dreams are long, remember my love in the Xiang River waves.</p>

<p>Topic: Quyuanchun's Hall Notes (II)</p>
<p>I heard this, and suddenly had a premonition. It is true that everything in life is caused by fate. I only remember the name "West Lake Chief," which originated from Su Shi. Su Shi had West Lake both when he guarded Hangzhou and Yingzhou. Therefore, when he arrived in Yingzhou to thank the Executive Yuan, he wrote, "Entering the two prohibitions, I have often tarnished the glory of the North Gate. As a local official in two states, I have repeatedly been the Chief of West Lake." Later, he was demoted to Huizhou, and there was also West Lake there. Therefore, Chen Chengzi's poem said, "Su Shi originally had a West Lake Chief, but he could not rest without going to Luofu." In that case, only those like Yu Weinong, who have served in this land, are entitled to call themselves that. This seal does not seem to be something that hermits should use. However, in this dynasty, there was a poet-monk Zheng Yan who wrote a poem in the style of Dianjiangchun, saying, "Coming and going through the smoke and waves, this life is called the West Lake Chief." If a Buddhist monk can call himself that, then we may also have no objection. Therefore, I wrote a poem in the style of Moshanxi, the first line of which is, "Wandering with books and swords, I am old and a West Lake Chief." Living in it without doubt, it's quite amusing.</p>

<p>A half-moon hangs, the night is deep and silent. Shining on the hearts of men and women everywhere. Thinking about it, there are many pessimistic people in the world. All are disappointed in love. How many people achieve a perfect and harmonious relationship to old age? Thinking of myself, I have endured hardships for half my life. Unwilling to look back at the past. No interest. Secretly sad. Facing the bright moon, I am desolate and heartbroken. I remember when we first met, it was as sweet as honey. Talking heart-to-heart under the flowers and moon. Playing together like childhood sweethearts. Always together, so close to each other. You loved me. I cherished you. We were so affectionate, so loving. I was, for you.  But I neglected my business. For you, I severed friendships. Once entering the realm of love, there is no escape. Spring silkworms spin silk until death.</p>

<p>Good marriage, promising to grow old together. Who knew a storm would arise from calm waters? You, my dear, changed your heart, embracing another. The person in my heart suddenly became a hateful person. I remember, back then, we made a secret vow on the Qixi Festival. Saying what, "You must pity me, and I pity you." Who knew your sweet words were all lies? Pitiful me, exchanging my true heart for your hypocrisy. Now, our vows of love have collapsed in an instant. Like strangers passing by. Swiftly, time easily passes. In no time, we became as cold as ice. This is truly, the falling flower intentionally following the flowing water. But the flowing water is heartless, what can be done? Do not say that all men are lucky. Even in the boudoir, there are unfaithful people. I am, infinitely sad, infinitely hateful. Every time I'm bored, I cry out loud. I might as well jump out of this land of troubles. Entering the empty gate to meditate, forsaking the mortal world. Beating the morning bell and evening drum to end my remaining life.</p>

<h3>New Trends in Automobile Design at the Earls Court Motor Show</h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>At this year's Earls Court Motor Show, there were 59 participating car manufacturers, including 30 from the UK, 15 from the US, and the remaining 14 from continental Europe. The novelty of the car styles, the high efficiency of the engines, and the safety of driving were truly deeply satisfying and unprecedented in previous exhibitions, and worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The streamlined design of car bodies has now entered a regulated state. The previously unrestrained car styles are difficult to find at the exhibition, because engineers have made further progress in the study of air resistance. The value of the drag coefficient has been newly determined, so the streamline design of any part of the car body is now much more precise. Furthermore, special consideration is now given to the volume of the passenger compartment, seeking appropriate proportions, which is completely different from the one-sided streamlining of the past.</p>
<p>All-steel car roofs were once the most fashionable, but they are now gradually being replaced by aluminum alloy ones. This new type of roof is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also extremely light, which can reduce the weight of the car body. It is also more economical and can save the cost of external paint.</p>
<p>Independent springs were heavily criticized by many engineers in the recent past, but they have recently been completely successful. At this exhibition, 66 percent of the cars displayed by the US and continental Europe did not have front axles. British cars probably have an even larger percentage. In these cars, the front wheels are supported by radius arms and transverse springs. The two wheels are not connected, so that the distribution of the car body's weight is more even. The vibration during driving is almost completely avoided, and repairs are also much easier.</p>
<p>The weight of the car body's skeleton is gradually being reduced, because strong and flexible special steel skeletons are gradually being adopted. The entire car bottom has now been successfully cast, which is truly a new record in the history of automobiles. However, because the cost is too high, it has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, most of the car body's joints must be welded, and its strength is several times greater than the old method of riveting. Therefore, it is almost impossible to find joints on the current new car skeleton.</p>
<p>The design of engines is now largely based on the operation of aircraft engines, and more comprehensive consideration is given. The amount of oil used per mile has been reduced to a minimum, and the piston stroke has gradually been increased to expand horsepower. Because the number of engine revolutions per minute is increasing, the work of the radiator is becoming increasingly important. The latest air and water radiators have been successfully adopted. In the past, engines could not transmit increased power after shifting gears (that is, changing speeds), resulting in a large loss, which was the most uneconomical thing. Now, the design of the gearbox has been changed to reduce losses significantly.</p>
<p>The most satisfying thing about new cars is the use of hydraulic power to automatically adjust the gaps in the valve mechanism, which is enough to make driving safer and more economical. This new device was not easy to design, and it was truly the result of joint research by all engineers. The radiator and crankshaft box have adopted integral sand casting, making the movement more sensitive. The lubrication system of each part of the engine is almost completely automated, and the lubrication areas of each part are more precise and effective, which is enough to promote the good operation of the engine.</p>
<p>The change of power transmission will be easier. Now a newer gear system has been invented. The "Thunderbolt" on the "Hudson" car has achieved amazing results. In this system, the speed change is completely done by the effect of current and vacuum. When applied, you only need to press the electric button to get the required action, which is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>The design of the passenger compartment is now gradually being entrusted to specialized engineers (separated from the car body design). Comfort and artistic beauty will be achieved. A new car with glass windows all around will be displayed. The advantage of this car is that it allows people in the passenger compartment to easily see and appreciate the scenery, especially when driving in the countryside.</p>
<p>The engine position will be further forward in the car body, while the rear of the car body will be more extended, and the bottom of the car will be closer to the ground, making the position of the passenger compartment more spacious. All of this is enough to increase the comfort and satisfaction of driving.</p>
<p>Judging by the results at this year's motor show, British cars probably occupy the most advantageous position. Among them, cars such as "Hillman" and "Humber" are impressively designed, with excellent construction, giving people a deep impression. Others such as "Alvis" and "Talbot" are also exquisite and agile, truly excellent structures. Of course, the "Ford" is the fastest growing of the new American cars, but in recent years, car manufacturers have been competing hard, and there has been more rapid progress in design and construction. There must be amazing results at this exhibition.</p>
<h3>Statistics of US Automobile Accidents</h3>
<p>36,000 Injured in 1934, Nearly 40,000 Expected in 1935</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was an article in this publication translating the statistics of automobile accidents in the United Kingdom. However, in some places, the UK's records were compared. According to the statistics of government agencies, in 1934, 36,000 people were killed by cars throughout the United States. As for this year, although accurate statistics are not yet available, many people believe that it will increase to 40,000, because the record of automobile accidents has been increasing rapidly in recent months. Nervous people believe that this situation is enough to reflect the recovery of the automobile industry, because at the height of the economic crisis, there were at least three to four million cars in the United States that were parked in garages because the owners did not have money to buy gasoline. Not only are these cars now being driven, but they are also increasing the number of miles driven. Two other reasons for the increase in accident records are the increase in speed and the fact that many drunk people have been driving since the end of Prohibition. According to statistical experts, the record of automobile accidents in the United States is not very high in fact. According to statistics in 1932, 21.9 people per 1,000,000 people in the United States were killed by cars, while that year it was 9.9 people in the UK. However, we must know that in the United States, there is an average of one car for every 5.25 people, while in the UK, there is only one car for every 25 people.</p>
<p>The record of deaths caused by automobile accidents is increasing, although it is due to the increasing number of car users, but in terms of proportion, it is probably far exceeding it. Between 1933 and 1934, the amount of gasoline consumed by cars in the United States increased by 7 percent, but fatal accident cases increased by 13 percent. In history, this record is the highest. The increase in records is much worse in the suburbs than in the cities. Perhaps city residents, whether pedestrians or drivers, have received a lot of lessons about avoiding accidents. They are cautious in walking and driving. The most common disaster is the collision of two cars, accounting for 43.3 percent of the total number of accidents. The second most common is the collision between cars and pedestrians, accounting for 38.3 percent. This may be unexpected. Accidents that do not involve collisions account for only 5.3 percent. The loss of life is much less in car-to-car collisions than in car-to-person collisions. The former accounts for only 23.8 percent, while the latter accounts for 44.3 percent. In 1934, a total of 954,000 people in the United States were injured by cars but not fatally. Although these accident cases include those caused by drunk driving, the record is increasing daily. But we cannot say that drunkenness is an important reason for the increase in automobile accidents, because in automobile accident cases, only 5 to 10 percent of drivers or pedestrians are mistaken due to alcohol. On this ratio, we really cannot point out that drunkenness is an important factor in increasing the accident record.</p>
<p>In recent years, some cities in the United States have started from the educational aspect to reduce the record of vehicle accidents. As a result, considerable success has been achieved, because in the midst of the national increase in records, those cities are decreasing. Take San Francisco, California, as an example. During the period when the number of fatal cases increased by 13 percent nationwide, it decreased by 15 percent. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, decreased by 13 percent during the same period. Recently, in order to reduce the accident record, the United States has adopted the method of inspecting all cars on the market at least once a year. Brakes, headlights, and other mechanisms must be inspected. If any defects are found, the car owner must be asked to repair them immediately to ensure driving safety. In some cities, the police in one area compete with the police in another area. As a result of maintaining traffic order, the accident record in that area is lower. Statistics are compiled once a week or month. Those who achieve good results are rewarded by the authorities. In this way, the police treat the drivers who cause accidents as enemies, and within the scope of possibility, they try to prevent automobile accidents. In some places, young people formally have a course in automobile driving in high schools for practice. Because in the United States, all children know how to drive a car by the time they are twelve or thirteen years old, so in fact they already know how to drive a car at that time. However, bad habits are corrected in school, and various operating principles of internal combustion engines are taught.</p>
<p>There is still a big shortcoming in the United States, which is that there is no unified traffic rule nationwide. All traffic regulations are formulated by each state. The rules on the road, even the police's gestures and the traffic lights at intersections, are different from state to state. Therefore, many disasters are caused by drivers not understanding these rules. In half of the states, driving a car does not require a license, and there is no minimum age limit. The accident record in these places is one-third higher than in strict places. In states where a driver's license is required, people sit in the car with the police officer when they go to take the test. They must first drive a lot of roads in the busy area, and then test the skills of turning and parking on a slope at the foot of a mountain. At the same time, they must be asked about various traffic rules and check whether their eyesight is good. People who apply for a license may pass the second or third time, but most of them fail the first time. In terms of the number of drivers nationwide, the United States is indeed the country with the lowest accident record. If a person causes a certain number of accidents while driving, the license will be revoked as usual. But someone suggested that such people should hang a huge white license plate on the car so that other drivers know that his driving skills are immature and that he needs a lot of space to drive the vehicle.</p>
<p>In the United States, in addition to the authorities, car manufacturers have recently joined forces to reduce the record of automobile accidents. Many new cars have been equipped with unbreakable glass. Even tires that are insured not to burst in the middle of the road have been discovered on the market. All new cars now have a lower gravity than old cars. Therefore, there are many fewer cases of collisions with trains, because most of these intersections do not have safety equipment, except for a part of these intersections with watchmen or wire gates. Therefore, car accidents easily occur when trains pass. Therefore, US President Roosevelt once advocated removing some of these intersections, and the road administration should also bear part of the expenses to prevent accidents. Comparing the driving course with the accident record, night is much more than day. The only reason is that the driver's eyesight is not good at night, and the headlights of oncoming cars are too strong, making it difficult for people to open their eyes. Therefore, some places have banned the use of strong headlights at night, or asked drivers to dim the lights when they see an oncoming car. Recently, someone invented a highway headlight that allows people to see the light even during the day. Because it uses gas light, it is very safe even if the vehicle is driven very fast. It is also safe not to use headlights in the dark.</p>
<p>In a country where there are 25 million of their buses, buses, and trucks, it is indeed not an easy task for the authorities to maintain traffic safety. Therefore, in university teaching, traffic management has now been included in the formal curriculum to train this talent. Recently, the United States invented a "double wave system" to manage traffic. This system has been tried on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Under this new system, the speed of driving is not allowed to exceed 30 miles per hour. Seeing the red light at the intersection turning into a green light, even if the traffic is congested, you can boldly move forward without stopping. This system is implemented on a road in two Rui. In addition, there is another method, which is a police car equipped with a sound transmitter. Each car has two police officers, one driving and one observing. They patrol on the road. The person observing has a very high sound transmitter in front of him. The cars half a mile away can also hear what he says. The police car patrols on the street. Seeing that some drivers do not follow the rules and fail to self-examine, they will be warned to make people pay attention. Therefore, seeing this police car passing by, the driver will pay special attention, and hearing the sound of warning others from afar will also alert himself. This is not necessarily a new method to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Lincoln Zephyr Car Exhibition</h3>
<p>On November 2, 193_?, the latest products of the automobile industry, the Lincoln Zephyr and Lincoln cars, were publicly displayed for the first day at the Astor Hotel in New York City. More than 61,000 people were attracted to visit.</p>
<p>This Zephyr car is the latest product in the mid-price car category. It is the result of the joint efforts and resources of the Ford Motor Company and the Lincoln Motor Company. Whether it is the appearance or engineering design, everything is novel and adopts the most advanced concepts. All the principles used have never been put into practice in the automobile production industry.</p>
<p>This car is equipped with a newly developed 110-horsepower V-12 engine. Its appearance is the most perfectly streamlined among mass-produced cars. It is also the first car made in the American continent without using a car frame or chassis. The car body is an all-steel "bridge-linked" type, with extraordinary strength. The installation of the engine is right in it. The moving gears are also attached to it.</p>
<p>The display at the Astor Hotel also included Ford A8 trucks and commercial vehicles. A total of 42 vehicles were displayed. At the same time, the same vehicles were displayed at the Ford retail showroom in New York. On the first day, a total of 22,000 people actually arrived. And the smaller-scale passenger car display held at the Park Lane Hotel had 7,000 people. The Astor Hotel also shows a moving picture introducing the new Zephyr car every day. There are 3,000 viewers every day.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Lubrication for Automobile Machinery</h3>
<p>— Little Ang</p>
<p>Generally, the friction between two machine parts, even to a slight degree, results in nothing more than the heating of the parts and the wearing down of the materials. Taking automobiles as an example, the material worn away by the brakes alone can reach tens of thousands of tons annually. The consumption of other capabilities is certainly significant. The use of lubricating oil is precisely to reduce this problem. When any smooth metal surface is viewed under a microscope, it appears uneven with bumps and dents. The lubricating oil used between two machine parts is stored in these areas, fulfilling its lubricating function. Sometimes, the oil can also be absorbed by the metal, giving it a glassy sheen. This phenomenon is commonly seen inside cylinders.</p>
<p>There are many types of lubricating oil, and their applications also vary. Briefly, they are discussed below.</p>
<p>Lubrication of crankshafts and bearings: When the crankshaft is rotating, due to the wedge effect, the shaft body rises, resulting in the highest and lowest pressure points between them. The lubricating oil should be added at the point of lowest pressure. The principle is very clear. (A) Types of Lubricators: Those used for crankshafts and bearings include: (a) Oil hole: A hole is drilled in the bearing, and oil is added to it from time to time. (b) Siphon: A cotton yarn strip with one end immersed in lubricating oil and the other end placed above the shaft, allowing drops to fall intermittently onto the shaft. (c) Needle Lubricator: A small gap is often left between the shaft and the bearing, which causes vibration during operation, thereby activating a needle-shaped valve in the lubricator. This allows lubricating oil to flow out. When the crankshaft is stationary, the needle drops due to gravity, preventing oil leakage. Because of this adjustment, it is more economical than the previous two. (d) Chain: A chain is placed around the shaft, with the lower end immersed in lubricating oil. As the chain rotates, it carries the lubricating oil upwards. (e) Collar: Its function is the same as above, but it replaces the chain with a collar. (f) Mechanical Lubricator: The lubricating oil is forced by a pump, forming a circulating system. The used oil is filtered and can be reused. Moreover, the heat generated by the bearing can also be dissipated through the circulation of the lubricating oil. This is the most economical and effective lubricator. It is widely used in machines of all sizes.</p>
<p>Cylinders and Pistons: The engine's power is sometimes reduced by as much as 10% due to the resistance between the cylinders and pistons. Insufficient lubrication can be heard as a rough, grating noise from within the cylinders. The lubricator used for this is the Hydrostatic Lubricator, which uses the pressure of condensed water to achieve lubrication. Another type uses injectors. In essence, the goal is to form tiny oil droplets that mix with the steam and adhere to the cylinder and piston. Mixed oil is commonly used, but it should not be used in steam engines with condensers. Only mineral oil should be used.</p>
<p>The types of lubricating oil and their application methods have been described above. Special attention should be paid to the selection of lubricating oil for automobile machinery. In short, the better the lubricating oil, the longer the life of the car, and the faster the speed. Long-distance travel becomes more comfortable. Automobile owners should pay attention to this.</p>
