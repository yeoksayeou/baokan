<p>禁烟一舉。於民族爲轉弱爲强之關鍵。於烟民自身爲改造生活之轉機。數十年來國人明知鴉片之害而未舉禁絕之功者。良以種烟販私乃利之所在。而禁烟政策又未得其當耳。自今年起。國民政府實行六年禁烟計畫。並任蔣委員長爲禁烟總監。分令各省市縣成立禁烟委員會。廣設戒烟醫院。中央地方。通力合作。禁烟前途自可樂觀。且今年適當實施一九三一年在日內瓦簽訂之限制麻醉品製造運銷公約之第一年。國聯最近開會。對於我國禁烟狀况。頗爲關心。在國際合作之下。我國禁烟政策之推行。亦復便利不少矣。</p>
<p>我國近來禁烟成績。據胡公使對國聯鴉片委員會之報吿。去年各地因販賣毒品而處决者共二百六十三人。在醫院戒絕烟癮者約八萬一千人。更據上海市吳市長之報吿。截至本年六月份止。公安局破獲烟毒各案八千六百九十九起。拿獲人犯一萬八千五百八十七人。司令部於二十三年六月起至本年六月止。處理毒品案件一千零九十四起。科徒刑以上之罪者一百七十人。至戒烟戒毒工作。自二十三年六月衛生局專設戒毒所及戒烟醫院後。至本年六月底。免費受戒而斷癮者。共二千七百二十三人。就以上數字以觀。成效固已大著。惟迄今國內烟民之衆。仍屬可驚。據胡公使對國聯之報吿。其數約逾百萬。如何使此百萬以上之國民脫離黑籍。實當今之重大問題也。</p>
<p>蔣委員長日前電令各省市。限年內辦妥烟民登記。此項登記手續。分兩步辦理。烟民自動登記於本月底滿期。强迫登記自十月起至十二月底滿　。登記而後。政府方面對於自甘暴棄弁髦法令之烟民。自宜繩以峻法。無所其用寬大。惟烟民類多缺乏毅力。卽使登記投戒。若不斷　毒糧。則因社會環境不良之故。戒後復吸。頗屬易易。戒烟之　如成週期性　。前途一大殷憂。吾人以爲欲奏禁絕之效。務須禁吸禁售。雙管齊下。缺一不可。私販之徒每因禁令愈嚴。獲利愈厚。禁售實較禁吸更難。禁烟當局欲貫徹其賢明政策。對於禁售方面。似宜更加注意焉。</p>

沒有鎭江館的肥腴，却也酥爛味厚，頗爲可口。　　魚頭豆腐　是杭州著名的菜肴，將鰱魚頭（靑魚尾巴鰱魚頭，原是美味，以前鏈魚須整條購買，但現在也可割碎另買，不過單買魚頭，價錢略微昂貴些。）在熟油鍋中略略煎熬，即加入醬油糖等，和入相當的水，用文火慢慢將魚頭煮爛，然後加豆腐，煮熱盛起時，加些蒜葉與胡椒末，吃起來膩膩的又鮮又肥，其香撲鼻，油膩中帶着爽辣。眞是另有一種美味哩　　鴨　秋季的鴨，比了夏季的嫩骨一握，也肉厚可食了。鴨的煮法：紅燒，淸煮，並皆佳妙。紅燒，將鴨切成小塊，加入些京冬菜，一同在文火上熓熟，在肥膩中有雋味，吃到嘴裏，十分爽口，比了整隻的好吃得多。淸煮鴨。須與火腿同煮，當然也十分鮮美的。　　蟹　蟹也是秋季常令的雋品，持蟹賞菊，是入得詩畫的一件雅事。蟹的味兒，是那般的鮮美，當熱氣蒸騰，紅紅的紥蟹搬上桌來的當兒，無論誰都要食指大動。那綻滿的黃油，蘸着薑醋，吃起米真是其味無窮。將蟹剝殼，川做蟹粉，將蟹粉煮菜，也是鮮美可口。蟹粉煮的菜肴，最普通的，是炒蟹粉：將蟹粉在油鍋中略略煎炒，然後加入醬油等作料即咸。炒蟹粉加豆腐或鴨蛋同炒，就成為蟹粉豆腐，或蟹粉炒蛋，都是佐飯的佳肴。將蟹粉煮爛，（則燜肉絲），或煮蟹粉魚翅等大菜，也很鮮美可口的。</p>

<p>申報無線電周刊簾栅眞空管的研究  學綸　　在普通三極眞空管屏柵二極的中間，再加一個柵極進去，給牠一個名字叫做簾柵，英文原名是Screen　grid簾柵是接正電位的，但是因爲用牠的目的各有不同，所以電壓也有高低的分別，應用時必定要配置滴當，方纔能够得到規定的效率。以我所看見的來說，同志們在初裝收音機時的失敗原因，有十分之七八是簾柵電壓的錯誤，因特將簾柵管分爲兩類說明之。　　（一）高放檢波簾柵管三極眞空管的屏柵二極，是相互對峙而裝在眞空玻璃管中的，所以就像拿眞空做誘電體的電容器一樣。這電容量的大小，是看屏柵二極的面積同距離而定，牠的電容量雖是很小，但已經足够發生回授作用，尤其在高週率，中間週率放大級中，竟能狂叫不能收音。這種障礙，以前雖已經過許多學者的研究，設法消滅，但終是得不償失。等到簾柵管發明之後，屏柵二極的中間，有了這一個簾柵極，於是拿原來的電容量平分爲二，串聯起來，讀者都知道的，電容量串聯是减小，所以簾柵管屏柵二極間的電容量可以减至極小，成竟至零。　　這類簾柵管有二種，一種是四極管，担任超外差式檢波用的，一種是可變放大係數五極管，是作高週率同中間週率放大用的，這兩種眞管用簾柵極的目的是要消滅屏柵二極間的電容量，所以簾柵電壓也要看這電容量而定，大約在直流眞空管是六七·五弗打，如三二號四極管同三四號五極管等，簾柵極的接綫，可在乙電池的分頭接出。在交直流同交流眞空管是九〇到一〇〇弗打，如二四號同三六號四極管，六〇，六六，五七號，同七七號五極檢波高放管，及六〇六，三九號，五八號，七八號可變放大係五極管等。簾柵極的電腰，必定要用降壓電阻或電位器調節而取得之。　　（二）低放强力五極管眞空管中的控制桐極，是常接在負電位上的，所以屏極的正電位，必定要有一部份消耗在勝過柵極負電位的上面，方纔能够向絲極吸收電子，結果使屏極的有效正電壓大减，這就就是舊式三極眞空管如〇一號同一二號等的放大係戰祗有八的綠故。　　上面已經說過，簾柵極是接正電位的，並且牠的位置是在屏柵二極的中間，離控制柵極比較屏極更近，因此原故，不要等到屏極的正電壓同控制柵極的負電壓接觸，牠早就拿柵壓降服，使屏極的正電壓可以完全工作在吸收電子上面，效率大增，這就是强力放大管的根本原理了。　　這種簾柵管的目的是要增加屏極吸收電子的能力，所以簾柵電壓可以用到屏極一樣，有時竟有超過屏極的。在直流眞空管是三三號，交直流同交流眞空管是三八，四一，四二，四三，四七，八九，二三五等號。當應用這一類眞空管的時候，牠的簾柵極可以直接乙電的高電壓，而毌需降壓的。　　寫到這裏，可以簡括說一句，同志們在裝配收音機的時候，倘楚應用簾柵管話，牠的電壓千萬不要弄錯，就此結東。收聽短波電訊時之「注意點」  泡　　收聽短波電訊，而欲得完美之結果，則收音機固爲最重要之工具，須加以重視，但對於收聽手續，亦須相當注意，否則難得完美成績，今述應注意之數點如下：　　一，不可以收廣播播音時之手法，以收聽短波，因短波之調節，異常敏銳，略將刻度盤轉動約一髮之差時，已有數電台跳去也。　　二，電台之播音時間，及所用之波長，應加注意（播音時間可查閱無綫電雜誌），再在播音時間內，此波長附近細心收聽。若以毫無目的之態度以旋轉刻度盤，終將一無所獲。　　三，短波之射程，與季候，時間，及所用波長極有關係，故應在適當之時間，適當之波段內收聽，否則决無良好成績。　　四，收聽短波電訊，尤其爲遠地電台，須有相當機巧，故調節時須特別細心。　　五，新收音機裝成後，先須熟知各旋鈕之功用及性格，最初練習接收近地電台，俟手法純熟後，則遠地電台自易逐一收到也。　　六，短波電台之射程，與高空之大氣，太陽之黑斑以及地球之磁塲等，均有相當關係。故雖爲已能收到之電台，亦不當存以後必能收到之觀念。　　七，如收得之電訊時强時弱，或竟時有時無，不可以爲病在收音機方面，此乃短波特有之衰落現象，非現時人力能挽救者也。（加裝「肖動音量控制一，略能减除之。）　　八，不可用裝置簡陋之天地綫。因惟有良好設計之天地綫，始能有良好之成績也。　　九，勿用室內天綫。　　十，勿因强大之雜聲而沮喪。因此種雜聲，大半來自近處之X光機及電療機等，並不時時有之，且亦可以相當方法减弱之也。　　十一，勿因成績不佳而沮喪，今日成績不佳，未必明日不能得異常優異之收穫也。直流二管短波收音機  芝　　——應用電子交連式回授控制——　　「電訊穩定」問題，在業餘通訊上，頗具有討論的價値；一方固屬於發射上的技術問題，而一部分責任也不得不歸原於收音方面：—此外業餘波段的隘狹，也形成收音上的中心困難。因此，業餘研究者的心目中，優良的短波收音機，固不在音量之宏大，而電訊之穩定，波帶之展闊，實屬重要也。　　今所介紹於此者，卽是一例。　　此機之綫絡見第一圖，機內應用眞察管二十二號式以及三十號式各一枚，組成一級電子交連式回授檢波，一級混合阻力交連低週率放大。檢波段並應用波帶展闊（Baud—Spreading裝置·　　此機收音的波長範圍極廣；可自一千四百五十千週至四萬一千千週爲北，共應用四脚揷入式綫圈五枚，波帶及用綫號碼等見左表：　　波帶（KC）z-3　L24　i-2　　（一）i45o-34oo　54i/2　3i4　/293/4　　（二）3o5o-71oo　271/2　11/4　ij3/4　　（三）6io-i42oo　i3i／2　3/4　4i／4　　（四）io6oo-24ooo　7i/2　i/2　ii/4　　（五）i8ooo-4iooo　3i/2　i/3　i/2　　以上五枚綫圈均用二十四號雙綫包綫繞製，揷入二綫圈管爲一又二分之一直徑者。各綫圈之長度均爲一寸半，繞法見第二圖A所示的。除第一枚綫圈外，均爲用間隙繞法，第二圖BC是綫圈管的俯視圖形。　　此機之應用零件，如後：　　Ci〇〇〇一兆分法拉調節波長用小型變量電容器。　　C2〇〇〇一兆分法拉柵極固定電容器。　　C3C4〇〇〇一兆分法拉固立電容器。　　C5·五兆分法拉固定電容器。　　C6〇一兆分法拉斷流電容器。　　R五兆歐姆柵極電阻器。　　R1五萬歐姆電位器，控制回授力用。　　R2五十萬歐姆因立電阻器。　　RFC二·五千分亨利高週率阻流圈。　　RFC1高週率阻流圈，用三十號單絲包綫，在直徑半寸之膠木軸上繞至二寸長。　　AFC低週率阻流圈，用低週率率壓器初次級串聯代之。　　S開關。　　V三十二號直流眞空管。　　V1三十號直流眞空管。　　此機若應用二瓶一，五弗打圓電串聯供給燈絲使用時，開關S應易以一十歐姆之燈絲變量電阻器，否則有傷眞空管壽命也。汞氣整流管  洪愼　　因爲汞氣眞空管的整流（Metcnryvapor　Rectifier）電腰輸出較大，並且能够使電壓的力量穩定，所以近來無綫電中的整流部分通行着汞氣管的應用，以代替普通眞空式的眞空管了，但是汞氣管的使用，比較難於管理，有許多地方却不能够不顧及的，依照了鄙人經騐所知，略爲發表一些管見。　　汞氣管擱久不用的時候，汞（即水銀）粒常凝結集合於屏極之上，應以燈絲燃點，約經過二三十分鐘使汞點蒸發，然後方能使用。　　每一個汞氣眞空管有一定規定的最大負電壓頂點（Maxiumm　Inverse　Peakof　Voltage）就是說在整流的時候，屏極及陰極之間的電流不通時的片刻時間，在這時候使能够耐受的最大電量，在使用的時候，不可超過這電壓的數量，就是高壓綫圈的電壓不可超過此規定之數（通常高壓綫圈的電壓爲百分之一百四十），假如用八十二號汞氣管，最大負電壓頂占爲一千四百弗打，若用每屏二百五十弗打的全波整流，高壓綫圈的電壓以百分之一百四十計算爲七百弗打，並未超過最大負電壓頂點，所以可以放心使用而沒有危險發生的。　　汞氣管的最大輸出電亦有一定的規定，這在使用時必須適當其量，如比較此數小的時候，壽命必致促短，如比此數量大的時候可以使其立卽毀損，所以在汞氣管的整流收音機上，試有無B電壓存在，切不可使B十及B一互相短路。　（未完）世界最大之全波收音機  吳日昇　　最近得來消息，美國紐約第一流大旅社「華爾多利夫亞斯多利」旅社，設置一具世界最大全波收音機。　　這個收昔機是由「威斯敦電氣公司」製造的，全體長七英尺，據說闊有五十英呎，可以收聽的週波帶是從550到1，500千週。但2，200到25000千週的短波帶，也可以收及。所以英國，法國，德國，蘇俄，日本，中國，意大利，菲洲，南美等世界上的播音台的播音差不多完全可以收到。　　此機備有六個裝置可以同時收音，旅客可以任意選擇一個來聽，該旅社有二千間客房，各房的裝有揚聲機及商量調節器（Volume　Controh）與選擇節目用的開關。　　收音機是裝置在旅館的六樓，旅館的附近電車，汽車等交通非常的頻繁，本來雜音是特別的多，可是藉最近的技術雜音，已完全征服，而且音量很好，也不受空電影響，苦心的製造於此可見。　　方式是起外差式（Super　hetro’yne），中間週率是385千週，只此中間週率已有100，000，000，000倍的放大數呢！介紹　　新刊實用無綫電雜誌卽將出版　　中雍無綫電機蔽發行　　上海勞合路七十七號，中雍無綫電機廠將發行「實用無綫電雜誌」月列，創刋號定於十月一日出版，聞執筆者均國內業餘先進，內容極爲充實，創刊號篇幅達八十頁之多，該期將載實騐綫路多種，如選擇性高超之交流四管機，短波交流兩管機，單管省電取音機，省電短波三管機等，精闢實用文字二十餘篇，該期零售價僅二角，預定全年十二冊二元二角，尙有優待辦法，收費尤爲低廉，聞往定者異常踴躍云。出版界「外國史」（下册）  應普漢　　何炳松編　商務印書館出版　　今春爲飢寒所迫，到浙東名勝區××縣的縣立中學去敎書。所任的課目是本國史跟外國史。其中外國史一門，前任敎員陳某採用了商務書館何炳松先生編的復興初中外國史作敎本。個人年來僻處鄉間，對於新近各書局出版的歷史敎科書，絕少寓目；因此即欲改選敎本，一時亦不無困難。况該敎本旣係我國史學界前輩何先生所編，並經敎育部專家審定，初臆定能使敎讀兩方十分滿意；所以就「簫規曹隨」，不車更張了。孰知事有出乎意料之外者，在講授中間竟先後發現了不少可議處，現因限於篇幅，擇其重要者略加檢討，是否有當，還希何先生指敎！　　（一）叙事不確（A）本書編者在第十六章第三節「宗敎革命的蔓延」中，謂「英王享利弟八對於路德的主張本不贊成，祗因他要與皇后離婚，敎皇不許，他纔打起宗敎獨立的旗幟，與敎皇脫離關係，他自己便兼做英國國敎的敎主。……他是取舊敎的形式而行新敎的精神。所以英國的宗敎革命比較的不算澈底」。（二〇九—二一〇頁）考享利第八所定的英國國敎，與羅馬敎會不同的地方，大抵在形式，而不在精神。他的信倏沒有什麼改變，所改變的是英皇來代替敎皇，作爲他的至高的首領罷了。所以個人疑何先生所叙的一他是取舊敎的形式而行新敎的精神」一句，大概是「他是取新敎的形式而行舊敎的精神一之誤。（B）本書的編者在第十八章第三節「英法殖民地的競爭」中，謂「巴卑爾所建的蒙兀兒帝國在十七世紀時，表而上雖是一個統一的國家，實際上早已成爲創據的局面」。（二三六頁）不知何所據而云然？考蒙兀兒帝國興於一五二五年，其兵力遠及於孟加拉。一五三〇年巴卑爾卒，國勢因是中落者凡二十五年。迄其孫亞格伯（Akbar）嗣位，勢始復振。亞格伯平定內亂，兵力集及於貝喇爾（Baran）。傳至曾孫奧朗則布，（Aurungzxeb1658-1707）盡降印度南部各國，統一印度，國勢最盛。十七世紀係亞格伯，喆漠吉，沙耶罕，及奧朗則布當國時代，何可謂「巴卑爾所建的蒙兀兒帝國在十七世紀時，表面上雖是一個統一的國家，實際上早已成爲割據的局面」？一七〇七年，奧朗則布死，帝國流於無政府狀態，國內諸侯（Rajah）及帝國官吏（Suhahdars及Nawabs）分疆而治，形同獨立，並互相鬥爭。雖家古皇帝尙居於德利（Delbi）然自十八世紀周年以後，徒擁虛名而已，故個人以爲蒙兀兒帝國之崩潰，編者所叙，未免失實。然編者在第二十三章第四節「印度和南洋的滅亡」中又謂「印度自十八世紀初年以後，君主多屬昏庸，國內巳經瓦解，外患內亂，相逼而來；所以實際上的蒙兀兒王朝自十八世紀以來，巳是名存實亡了」。前後對照，顯係矛盾，足見上文是編者一時的筆誤。又，如「巴卑爾所建的蒙兀兒帝國在十七世紀時，表面上雖是一個統一的國家，實際上早已成爲割據的局面」一一段，編者係指英法荷備等國侵佔印度通商口岸而言，固屬勉强可通；然終因行文欠明白，易於引起讀者的誤會，亦應略加修正爲是。　　（二）章目失宮——好的章目，必與該章的節目標切合；猶之乎好的文章，必與該文的題目相切合一樣。不然，若在固定的章目中，揷入該章目以外的話，那就不僅浪費有限的篇幅，而且還要給讀者不正確的觀念。爲害之大，較錯誤尤甚。蓋錯誤易於發現，而此則非悉心推究，極難辨別也。本書的編者在第十九章「近世歐洲的舊制」中，分「佃奴制度和各業公所」，「貴族和敎士」，「歐洲的學術」等三節述之。個人以為第一二兩節中的佃奴制，同業公會及敎會……等固可以制度目之：而第三節中的歐洲的學術，如英國彌爾頓的詩，沙氏比亞的劇，法蘭西斯培根的歸納法，法國莫利哀的劇，孟特斯鳩的法意，盧騷的社約論，以及服爾德狄德羅等的著作，要硬派它們是制度，不消說是極其牽强的。所以個人覺得該章與其定名爲「近世歐洲的舊制」，毌寗定名爲「近世歐洲的舊制及文化」雖稍嫌累贅，似較爲切當些。質之編者，不知以爲何如？　　（三）有果無因——人類的歷史是很複雜的，敎科書—尤其是初中敎科書—限於篇幅，當然不能仔細探究；然對於重要的史蹟，仍非略述其因果關係不可。否則，讀者便莫明其究竟了。本書的編者在第十七章第四節「普魯士的勃興中叙七年戰爭云：「不久西歐方面又起了一次大規模的七年戰爭（一七五六—一七六三）東至印度，西至美洲，無不大起干戈。重要的戰國，除奧大利和普魯士兩對壘國外，還有荷蘭，法國等國，帮助奧大利，英國則帮助普魯士。戰爭的結果，在海外方面，是英國在北美和印度打收了法國人，成爲兩地的霜主，爲他日雄飛世界的權輿。在歐洲力面，則普魯士打倒奧大利在日耳曼帝國中的勢力，爲後來普魯士建設德意志帝國的初步」。（二二六—二二七頁）這段文章敎人看了，覺得道次大規模的七年戰爭彷彿是無緣無故地發生的，簡直摸不着半點頭腦。這想是因爲編者忽略了起因的緣故。七年戰爭，爲近世史上標界之一，犧牲白萬生靈，耗去無數軍費，致歐洲除普魯士外，任何國家，負有國債，至今尙未淸償。喪失法國之殖民地，開闢法國革命之途徑。降低奧大利之地位，爲神聖羅馬帝國崩潰的先聲。然英普兩國的地位，則非常增高；英格蘭則增加海上之勢力及海外之領土；而普魯士則成爲歐洲首屈一指的强國。其影響之大，有如此者。何可不略述起因：「奧女王爲利亞得利薩痛恨腓特力第二之强佔西利西亞，思有以報之，遂引起七年戰爭……」使讀者一看，便能瞭然於中呢？　以上幾個缺失，如在目前一班淺薄的學人所編的歷史敎科書中出現，原可輕輕放過，不必深究；但對於我國史學界前輩何先生所編的敎科書，我們不免懷了點奢望：因而便不能不「資之以全」，「求之以恒」了。好在何先生曾在上冊的例言中聲明過：「本書編纂，因時問關係，或有未妥善處，倘承讀者見吿，謹當於再版時訂正，藉謂雅見」。何先生虛懷若谷，當不以鄙貢爲唐突「威權」吧？讀「中國田制業考」  曾建屏　　爲着讀一點中國田制的書，我走遍了四馬路的書局。在商務印書備，我看見—陳伯瀛著的新書—中國田制叢考。我首先看序言，只見他劈頭寫着「田制叢考者，不佞二三年來治史之結果也」。於是，遂無暇再翻細目，立刻以九角大洋不折不扣地把它買回。當晚燃燭夜讀，始知大錯。　　本來一部用二三年的工夫作出來的大書，其內容應該是比較的充實及卓越才對。可是陳伯瀛的著作，却沒有絲毫負起這種應該的任務。他只是把陳登元「中國土地制度的內容摘抄，此外略略加上他自己的「卓見」及某些補綴就算了。本來陳登元的那本著作，在方法論上，已經不能算是一部什麽了不得的好書；不過在中國現代這麼貧困的學術界上，陳氏那本中國十地制度，還是可以有一讀的價値的。然而它雖然有一讀的價値，却不能說就有在兩個書名之不出來翻印的必要。可是不幸得很，陳伯瀛的著作，在許多部份中，却正與陳登元的著作的翻印無異。這眞是現代出版界的怪現象！　　這種怪現象有什麽證明沒有呢？這里我們且將兩書論王莽王田制這一節來考察。　　首先我們來看陳登元的中國土地制度：　　陳登元的中國土地制度，它是將王莽的王田制度排在第四章六節裏面的。他在這一節書中，首先即說王莽「敦讀周禮，至夜分不寢」；接着便說到他「上書歸孝哀皇帝所益封邑」的故事：接着又說到王莽所主張王田的內容；（從漢書九十九中「古者設廢井八家，一夫一婦，田百畝，什一而稅……」。這一節引起）又接着即引用淸王夫之的批評，以爲；「君子之道，以經世者，亦惟小人之不可竊者而已……」。於是他最後即總結出王莽王田制度所以失敗的原因，是由於：　　（一）民可與因循，難與革新。　　（二）當時與政治有關係之人，實爲貴族與富豪。易言之，參與政治之人物，在地主而不在佃農。此等中等以上之地主階級，對於王田之制，自必深惡痛絕。　　（三）實施時之措置，未得一般民衆之同情（參考陳登元著作六十九頁）。　　以上所述，均係陳登兀所著中國土地制度中關於王莽王田制度實施過程中的輪廓。在這種輪廓中，我們正以他對方法論無十分的了解以致不能較正確地從社會科學所提供的方法去應付他所集的歷史資料。可是，研究了二三十年才著了一本「中國田制叢考」的陳伯瀛，並欲以之與馬端臨的「文獻通考」「相形並提」（見他的序言）的陳伯瀛，在他的「王莽王田考」這一段中，却是不多不少地和陳登元的考證一樣。他也是從王莽「讀周禮」這故事講起，其中所引的漢書，王夫之的批評以及所作的結論，其內容可謂完全和陳登元一樣。假使陳伯濤的著作，是先於陳登元的著作而出版，是沒有花了那麼多的工夫而單編著出來的，那尙可說；可是陳登元的著作是民國二十一年出版的，而陳伯瀛的著作却是今年才出世。前後三年，則陳伯瀛的大著之以陳登元的著作爲藍本，並抄竊其中的引證章法及結論，至爲顯然。即使退十步說，達者所見，或有相同之處；然也不能那麽過引據及結論都完全相同的。而且不止一章相同，其他各章節也多相司。　　總之，我旣買了陳伯瀛的書，並且讀了他的書，當然只好痛在心頭；不過，希望大多數的讀者，以後不要再上他那以研究爲招牌的著作的大當吧了。「英文中國季刊」  吳道存　　曹雲祥主編　國際問題研究會等出版　　號稱東方問題權威的邁克納敎授（Prof　MaeNair），有一篇文章呌做Wantedt　An　Interpreter（需要一個解釋者），他說，印度因爲有泰戈爾，西洋人於是認識印度多多了，泰戈爾是印度的解釋者。中國所需要的也是像泰戈爾這一類的人，使西洋得以了解中國。　　到了今日，許多自命爲文明的西洋人中不知道中國是怎樣的，還是可以車載斗量。他們以爲中國是一個神秘的古國，男子個個後面拖着一條辮子，女子個個是三寸金蓮。某次美國報紙上有張中國人的挿畫，那畫中的中國人穿上一雙木屐。連辦報的編輯先生們都不認識中國，遑論其他呢？　　然而我們自己也應該負責任。我們素來不向人家解釋，怎能呌人家了解我們呢？我們自己旣不向人家解釋我們，於是讓別的人來向人家誤解我們了。有心中傷我們者不必論，而西洋的旅行家到了上海，在大旅館裏住三五天以後，便做了「中國通」，回到本國滔滔不絕的作關於中國的演說了。　　最近出版（九月）的「英文中國季刊」（The　China　Quarterly）至少是中國的解釋者之一。　「英文中國季刋」的形式頗似美國的「耶魯評論」（Yale　Review）和「外交事件」（Foreign　Affair），雖然封面是紅的。印刷與紙張都很好，且相當的厚，共一百八十面。編者曹先生吿訴我們說：「英文中國季刋是中國國際問題研究會，中國太平洋協會，和社會經濟研究會聯合出版的」。他繼續解釋這個理由，因爲三個機關有共同的目的。　　「英文中國季刋」有什麼態度呢？編者又吿訴我們：「英文中國季刋本以沒有確定的政策，爲撰稿諸位發表各種不同覜點的媒介物而已。本刋所有的文字並不是說編者們一定同意。因此牠的本身是一個純粹研究的刊物，然而牠無疑地可以促進外國人對我們的認識。研究中國問題的外國人所根據的中國材料，大都取自「英文中國評論週報」和「密勒氏評論報」，現在可以多得一秤良好的他們能閱讀的刋物了。　　創刊號包括十篇文字，關於經濟問題的六篇，內有一篇爲財長孔祥熙的全國財政報吿。此外，還附有一篇全國經濟委員會的報吿。其他四篇爲「向不承認主義的挑戰」，「日俄關係」，「遠東形勢的變遷」，及「近代中國醫學敎育的發展」。撰稿人的履歷有短短的介紹，這是很隊外國雜誌。　　「英文中國季刊」自然不僅是專爲外國人閱讀的，留心本國及國際問題的國人，亦可以從牠的裏面得釗新的資料。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言中國起碼應該學狗  夢若　　吳稚暉先生平日不開口则已，一開口总是語妙天下，含有若干幽默意味。他老人家这一次赴故都遊玩，和往訪新開記者談話，除說些什麼「大水災是大禹害人，以農立國已喊不得，救國法寶只有科學」，最後很慨然的道，「中國想要裝老虎或獅子，固然不容易，但起碼也應該學一個狗，因為一隻狗你要打死牠的時侯，至少你也要有相當的犧牲才是。　　中國之裝老虎或獅子者久矣。在從前，我們嘗以老虎或獅子自居。這句話並不是我憑空虛造出來的，許多外國人常說中國是一個獅子國，不過這隻獅子是睡獅子。其實自雅片戰役以後，這隻睡獅更變也了綿羊，一任列强張牙舞爪來吞噬了。　　然則我們將永願居綿羊的地位，而不思振作嗎？這是不然的。吳先生告訴我們，「中國想要裝老虎或獅子，固然不易，但起碼也應該學一個狗。」學狗有什麼好處呢？狗雖比不上老虎或獅子，但比綿羊總强得多。綿羊只能供人宰割，狗一受人殘踏，牠便會呌吠，會反撲，有詩竟會狠狠的咬你一口。卽如吳先生所云，「一隻狗你要打死牠的時候，至少你也要有相當的犧牲才是。」　　其實做綿羊雖然可恥，學狗也未見得怎樣光榮。但我們明白，吳先生說這句話，自有其不得已的苦衷。　我國幾年來屢屢受人侵略，一點反抗的精神都沒有。長此下去，中國只有漸趨滅亡，一無出頭的日子。故他以為典其做一雙綿羊，馴服服任人控制。不如學一個狗，有人要來打我們的時候，便可以和他拚一個死海。這是狗值得學的地方。　　前日意相墨索里尼，曾以「生為綿羊，苟活百年，不如獅于之一日」一語，鼓勵全國人心。我國今日要裝老虎或獅子，已　不成，做綿羊也不是我們所願。那末我們且來學一個狗罷。秋收  新野　　幾天的風雨已叫龔家堡的人日夜的躭心，幾處田　頭，人儘像巡邏隊似的來往着。每一張臉子上差不多蓋上了一層嚴霜；在那枯瘦而又萎黃的氣色裏面，孕育着一股濃厚的憂鬱，在那大箸帽和破簑衣底下，已無法掩藏他們的饑寒。但望望天，天也是同他們的臉色一樣難看：佈滿了那麼一塊討厭的烏雲，雨儘如新死丈夫的少年寡婦的眼淚似的，不盡的流，流的風直刮得那些樹梢在空中發抖，風跟雨一同地跌在纔結着一包榖漿的稻上，使它們全彷佛滾龍般的向泥水裏倒了下去。　　「咳！一碗飯已經捧到了嘴邊了，還要來把它打掉，我們的命眞生得這樣地糟了嗎？」四大嫂在堂屋裏搓草繩，偶然抬頭看看門外，風和雨仍舊在無休止地吹着飄着：她不覺憤憤地將草繩一</p>

<p>攢，「這還要搓　斷命繩鳥用？反正也不過預備將來去捆幾束爛稻草回來墊墊猪窩。」　　四哥却有氣沒力的從後門走了進來，斜了老婆一眼，他就　衣也不脫，把頭上那頂箸帽向地下一丟，一屁股坐在門檻上去了。　　這樣，好久兩人全呆着，關係把兩支視綫凝視着地皮，偶爾四條視綫碰頭一下，也不過互相傳遞一下哀愁的訴說。　　晚餐，他們照常是一個粗絲南瓜，在燒的時候多加些水，就勉强也有三碗一個人好吃了。　　「滿想我們割了稻，牽了礱可以吃幾頓新米飯了；這勞什子的南瓜吃了半年，實在太乏味……」四大嫂每次想到嘖香的白米飯時，總會咕嚕咕嚕的咽幾口涎沫的。當她在早幾天望到自家田裏那金黃色的稻花，就裂着嘴說：「我們可有米飯吃啦！」但近來一連三五天的秋風秋雨，直幾乎把她這個吃飯夢打得粉碎。　　「人不要不如足」，四哥已經將一大碗南瓜，連皮帶湯都吃完了，才把空碗沉重放在檯上，然後將另一碗端上了手說：「你還不看見呢，老二老三他們連南瓜也早已吃光了！」　　「他們也眞可憐，孩子又這樣的多！」　　天睛了，太陽已經很嫵媚的從東方探起頭來，龔家堡的每一個人臉上也彷彿看到一個垂死的病人忽然轉機了似的歡喜了起來。　　不多幾天，田裏的稻桿子全變成了金黃，那稻穗子也沉重得低垂了頭，要是拿一個稻穗子來秤秤，我相信至少也有四兩重的，於是這一樂眞幾乎使龔家堡的每一個農人全樂得跳起了來。　　大人們在想「我們總可以吃幾天新米飯了。」孩子們在想：「我們也好呌爹媽做幾升米糕糰了。」　　幾天以來，全村子的人都忙着收割，所以家裏的孩子也儘讓他們在村裏村外亂闖，並沒有一個人去管束他們，就是幾條狗子也夾着尾巴在亂跑：在每一家門前的曠塲上，却全堆滿着一大堆一大堆的稻，田片裏的男女全彎了腰在將一束一束的稻捆起來，路上田埂上全是那些挑稻的人，大家踫面打一個招呼，　各人　　起了，但看得出的，在他們的臉上都有一種好久不曾顯露過的愉快。　　從收割，掠稻，將榖，牽礱，打米，全村裏的人整整的辛苦了半個月，他們忘記疲倦，忘記饑餓，興奮地做着，但等到還過租米，納過糧，他們只剩了一些粞糠，可是借空的債，吃空的米，還是沒有辦法來還！　　「這一季秋收，別處是水災或旱荒，然而龔家堡却是意外的會豐年。」好些地方人全這樣羨慕着說。　　「唉！這算豐年，自己白辛苦了半年巴望了半年，料不到反連米皮也沒吃着，半年汗血，一季大望，祇換得了這些粞糠」！龔家堡的人却嘆着大氣這樣說。　　大家同樣的哭喪着臉；你望望我，我看看你，對於以後的日子是沒有把握，對於未來的運命也是不可捉模……山居雜記  孟華　　雨天還有一件更令人厭惡的事情，就是在這山邨裏，沒法子接到信件與新聞，而且阻止了朋友們的訪問。它把我圍困在這小屋子皇，它把空間擴大了。　　入夜，伴着淸油燈坐着。流螢在斗屋裏來回亂飛。野犬咻咻的吠聲，同那屋外雨點落在樹葉上那沙沙的聲音，聽了更令人戰憟，而不知從何處吹來，亦不知向何處吹去的飄忽的山風，更像原始的戰爭，一般憤怒地吼嘯着。於是我覺得自己實在大渺小了，太微弱了，我深深地明暸原始時代初民們的神的觀念。　　我極無聊賴地躺在床上像被禁錮在黑暗的土牢裏，又像被困在千軍萬馬的重圍之中。　　「同在一個國度哩，一個地方鬧着旱災，成千成萬的人被餓死，而我們却在淫雨的圍困之中，人類征服自然的日子，什麼時候才實現呢？」我這樣想着，我想這並不是不可能的吧。　　（二）紅葉　　在我房子對過有一面高大的，石砌的圍牆，牆面上密密地緾着幾叢爬山虎，它把整個牆面全都遮滿了。　　是秋天，傍晚時候。　　我獨坐在房子里，什麼聲音亦聽不到，只有山風掠過牆頭，侮弄着那些爬山虎的葉子，葉子就在風中顫顫地動着，發出了一陣陣蕭騒的聲音，亦活像一個年邁的老人的戰排。離枝的葉子從上面滾下來，隨着風輕輕地敲着窗門，低低地吐着一些不為人所知的哀訴。被帶在牆角的殘葉亦不住地在風中打滾，那蕭瑟的聲音，在飄忽的晚風中就像一個臨死的人的嘆息。這時候，一個孤獨的山居者，尤其是一個有病的人，他的心就像鉛一樣，又沉又重。　　爬山虎的葉子這　節有些已由綠轉黃，有些却由黃變成朱紅了。它紅得像丹楓，紅得像血一般。它曉得它的末日到了，就把剩下所有的精力凝結在這上面，變成紅紅的，艷艷的。但秋慚慚深了。日里有風吹打，夜里有霜侵凌，它終於辭枝飄墜下來，頹然地被捲在牆角裏的敗時堆里。　　紅葉，我管它。它不怕嚴霜，越凍得重，它越紅得動人。紅葉是美的。落日的殘照亦是美的，然而暮却跟踪而來，這象徵着什麼呢？波德申海浴  達　　由山巒蒼翠的蓉芙到波德申，車行要一點一刻的時間才到達。沿途經過小坡二：一為萬茂；一為盧骨。車上眺覽，有如走馬觀花，然遠山眉黛，綠林恬靜，景色幽美，忽忙中也還隱約可以領略。　　波德申的市鎭並不怎樣的大，全坡祇有一條不十分齊整大街，和幾條街　。大街上的店舖大都是很低矮而又簡陋的，此外，更襯着街道的兩旁的高大參天的大樹，故在白天裏，店裏的光綫也會覺得陰暗死沈沈的。這裏的生意，除了極少數是吉寗人開創之外，其餘的全為我們僑胞所經營。政府和公館以及醫</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan passed twelve articles of the Telecommunications Public Bond Regulations of the 24th year of the Republic of China, with a total amount of 10 million yuan, issued at 96%, an annual interest rate of 6%, with principal and interest repaid by the Central Bank every three months, fully repaid in seven and a half years, denominations of 5,000, 1,000, and 100 yuan, freely bought and sold for mortgage. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 30th session on the morning of the 27th, attended by 65 members including Wang Kunlun, chaired by Sun Ke, and Secretary-General Liang Hancao. The Telecommunications Public Bond Regulations of the 24th year of the Republic of China were passed. Ma Yinchu, in his initial report on the review of the case, stated that this 10 million yuan public bond was originally intended to repay the water and electricity loans of the Datong and Dabeiguo companies, to reorganize the domestic trunk lines, and to build radio stations. The income from international telegraph fees, approximately one million yuan annually, was designated as the principal and interest fund. Later, as the water line negotiations had been largely resolved, the water line loan companies were not pressing for repayment, and the international fee income had been used for other purposes, the public bond fund could not be determined. Therefore, although the public bond regulations had been passed and promulgated by the National Government in the 18th year, and amended and promulgated again in the 19th year, they were not issued as scheduled. In the 22nd year, the Ministry of Communications, citing the exhaustion of telecommunications funds and the need to revitalize telecommunications, and the fact that the debts offset by international fee income had been gradually repaid, with most of it available for the public bond fund, resubmitted the matter to the Executive Yuan, proposing to change the issue date of the public bond to January of the 23rd year. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministries of Finance and Communications to consult, but the issue was temporarily postponed due to unresolved fund issues. Currently, the international fee income originally used as the fund, after deducting the principal and interest of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity loan, has a surplus of 200,000 yuan per month, which is designated as the public bond fund, more than sufficient. Telegraphs, telephones, and radio all urgently need expansion and reorganization, requiring substantial funds. The issuance of public bonds cannot be delayed. The Ministries of Finance and Communications continued to negotiate, proposing to change the name of the public bond to the Telecommunications Public Bond of the 24th year of the Republic of China, and drafted a draft of the regulations, revising the principal and interest repayment schedule. This was submitted to the Executive Yuan, which forwarded it to the Central Political Council, which passed it and sent it to this Yuan for review. The Finance Committee invited representatives from the Ministries of Finance and Communications to attend the meeting and provide explanations. The review concluded that this public bond was indeed needed for legitimate construction purposes and should be approved for issuance. On the 27th, the case was passed by the Yuan meeting. When submitting it to the government for promulgation, a request should be made to repeal the previously promulgated regulations for the Telecommunications Public Bond of the Ministry of Communications of the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China to avoid duplication. Then, the secretary read the articles, which were unanimously passed without objection, according to the review report. (The regulations consist of twelve articles, the content of which is no different from what was published by this newspaper on the 24th). (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the League of Nations Administrative Council passed a resolution on the 26th to establish a committee to study and resolve the issue of the number of members of the Administrative Council and to review China's proposal on this issue. The original text of the resolution is as follows: The Administrative Council has reviewed the document from the Chinese government on May 21st, knowing that according to the resolution of the General Assembly in October 1933, the issue of the number of members of the Administrative Council should be reconsidered when the period from 1933 to 1936 is about to end. Member states of the League of Nations are free to suggest the final solution to this issue. It has now been decided to immediately appoint a committee to undertake the above-mentioned study and review China's proposal on this issue. The chairman should report to the Administrative Council and the General Assembly. The Administrative Council, composed of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Spain, France, Iran, Italy, Peru, Poland, Sweden, and the Soviet Union, requests the committee to start work as soon as possible and authorizes the Secretary-General to notify all member states of the League of Nations of the date on which the committee should receive any proposals it wishes to make based on the resolution of October 3rd, according to the request of the committee.

Yesterday, they jointly cabled the central government, requesting the reaffirmation of a clear order to guarantee the old system. The original cable obtained is as follows (abbreviated title): We have found that the original league and banner system of Mongolia has been followed by successive dynasties since the late Qing Dynasty for hundreds of years. The 181st Central Political Conference of the 18th year of the National Government, the Mongolian Conference of the 19th year, and the eight principles of the recently promulgated measures to resolve the Mongolian autonomy issue all clearly stipulate that the original jurisdiction and governance rights of the league and banners and the prince system will be guaranteed and not changed. The decree is brilliant and witnessed by the world, because the historical habits of our Mongolian people are very different from those of the inland. The maintenance of stability depends entirely on the old system. The central government's clear order to preserve the princes is to preserve Mongolia. The princes and others also appreciate the central government's intention to support and protect the border, and are determined to remain loyal. Recently, there have been rumors that some people, without the approval of the central government, have automatically abolished the princes and reformed the old system. If this happens, the Mongolian banners will lose their center of gravity, and there will be more trouble in the border areas. For the sake of preserving the four-hundred-year foundation and maintaining the peace of two hundred thousand Mongolian people, the Jasaks and others are earnestly appealing, requesting the central government to reaffirm a clear order to guarantee the old system, so as to reassure the people of the distant regions, and look forward to clear appointment.

<h3 id="e14">Deadline for Opium Addicts to Register <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The eradication of opium is crucial for the nation to turn from weakness to strength and for the opium addicts themselves to transform their lives. For decades, the Chinese people have known the harm of opium but have not taken action to eliminate it because the cultivation and sale of opium is profitable, and the opium eradication policy has not been effective. Starting this year, the National Government is implementing a six-year opium eradication plan and has appointed Chairman Chiang as the Inspector General of Opium Eradication, ordering each province, city, and county to establish an opium eradication committee and set up opium addiction treatment hospitals. With the central and local governments working together, the future of opium eradication is promising. Moreover, this year is the first year of implementing the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs signed in Geneva. The League of Nations recently held a meeting and was quite concerned about the state of opium eradication in China. With international cooperation, the implementation of China's opium eradication policy is also facilitated.</p>
<p>According to Ambassador Hu's report to the League of Nations Opium Committee, the recent achievements of opium eradication in China include the execution of 263 people for drug trafficking last year and the treatment of approximately 81,000 people for opium addiction in hospitals. Furthermore, according to Shanghai Mayor Wu's report, as of June of this year, the Public Security Bureau has uncovered 8,699 opium cases, arresting 18,587 people. The Headquarters handled 1,094 drug cases from June of the 23rd year to June of this year, with 170 people sentenced to imprisonment or more. Regarding opium and drug addiction treatment, since the Health Bureau established a drug addiction treatment center and opium addiction treatment hospital in June of the 23rd year, a total of 2,723 people have received free treatment and broken their addictions as of the end of June this year. Judging from the above figures, the effectiveness has indeed been significant. However, the number of opium addicts in the country is still alarming. According to Ambassador Hu's report to the League of Nations, the number is over one million. How to get this one million or more citizens out of the black market is a major issue today.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang recently telegraphed all provinces and cities, setting a deadline to complete the registration of opium addicts within the year. This registration procedure is carried out in two steps. The deadline for voluntary registration by opium addicts is the end of this month. Compulsory registration will begin in October and end at the end of December. After registration, the government should punish opium addicts who willingly abandon and disregard the law with severe punishment, without leniency. However, many opium addicts lack willpower. Even if they register and seek treatment, if the drug supply is not cut off, they are likely to relapse due to the poor social environment. If opium addiction treatment becomes a cyclical process, the future is a major concern. We believe that in order to achieve the effect of eradication, it is necessary to ban both smoking and selling. The more strict the ban, the more profit the traffickers make. Banning sales is more difficult than banning smoking. It seems that the opium eradication authorities should pay more attention to the banning of sales in order to implement their wise policy.</p>

<p>Britain Approves Collective Action Against European Aggressors</p>
<p>No Guarantee of Military Aid to France</p>
<p>Future Attitude Depends on Circumstances</p>
<p>(London) France recently inquired with Britain whether Britain would support collective action against European aggressors in the future. The British government delivered a reply to Paris yesterday. The French government immediately informed French Prime Minister Laval, who is currently in Geneva, of the contents of the reply by telephone. It is reported that the British government is unwilling to make prior commitments regarding any specific or hypothetical cases of aggression in Europe. The reply reiterates the statements made by British Foreign Secretary Hoare at the League of Nations General Assembly on September 11 regarding Britain's attitude toward the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. At that time, Hoare declared that Britain would abide by its common obligations, collectively safeguard the League of Nations Covenant, and collectively reject all unprovoked acts of aggression. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Associated Press learned today that Britain delivered an important reply to French Ambassador Corbin today, refusing to guarantee military assistance to France in the event of aggression by Germany or other European countries. The reply also solemnly stated that Britain generally approves of taking collective action against any aggressor country, but its theoretical attitude toward the future situation will depend on how events develop. After British Foreign Secretary Hoare's recent speech in Geneva advocating collective action against Italy, France inquired with Britain. Diplomatic circles believe that this reply from Britain has put France in a difficult position. It is believed here that after the recent establishment of the naval agreement between Britain and Germany, Britain may have changed its attitude at the Stresa Conference. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Paris Morning Post, Britain's reply to France's inquiry regarding sanctions is not much different from the British foreign policy announced by Foreign Secretary Hoare in Geneva. However, French Foreign Minister Laval is still negotiating with the British side on this matter in order to obtain a clearer confirmation. The British side also acknowledges that there is room for further changes in the British reply, but this depends on France's ability to make further statements regarding its obligations in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Therefore, the British government's reply to the French government will not be published until Laval's verbal statement reaches London. (27th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Thirteen-Nation Committee Holds First Meeting</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute has been formally established. All member states of the Executive Council, except Italy, have joined. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and British Minister Without Portfolio Eden also attended. The committee accepted in principle the Ethiopian Emperor's request that the Executive Council appoint an investigation team to go to the border of that country and entrusted French Foreign Ministry African Division Deputy Director Saint-Quentin, British Foreign Ministry Egyptian Division Director Thompson, and Spanish representative Ariwen to discuss implementation methods. At the same time, it also telegraphed the Ethiopian Emperor, expressing its approval of the withdrawal of that country's troops 30 kilometers from the border. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat recently issued a summary communiqué stating that the Thirteen-Nation Committee on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute held its first meeting at 10:30 this morning. Spanish representative Madariaga was elected as chairman. The committee discussed the Ethiopian Emperor's request to appoint an investigation team, drafted a reply, and decided to publish it today. It then decided on its working methods and adjourned at 12:30. The next meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow morning. (27th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to Havas News Agency's diplomatic correspondent, during the non-public meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council this morning, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi, and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu all objected to the recommendations of the Five-Nation Small Group Committee, saying that it was too biased towards Italy. The reason why the Executive Council did not adopt the recommendations of the Five-Nation Small Group Committee this morning but decided to organize a committee to draft a new one was that some representatives in the Executive Council raised objections, and the recommendations of the Small Group Committee would not be unanimously approved. According to League of Nations officials, Italy cannot expect the League of Nations Executive Council to put forward a plan that is more favorable than the recommendations of the Five-Nation Small Group Committee. What is particularly noteworthy is that none of the member states attending the Executive Council is willing to defend Italy's attitude. However, this decision of the Executive Council still leaves a five-minute window for a settlement, but a settlement is only possible if Italy makes concessions. The only question currently facing France is whether Italy will attack Ethiopia before the Executive Council passes a report and recommendations in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 6 of the Covenant, or whether it will launch the attack after the report and recommendations are passed.

<p>Paris Newspapers Observe</p>
<p>Hopes for Peace Diminish</p>
<p>Rumor of French Loans to Italy Denied</p>
<p>(Paris) The hope that the League of Nations will mediate and resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is diminishing. The Times published an editorial today saying that nothing has been preserved so far, but nothing has been completely lost. In the general opinion, although there are still ten to fifteen days of breathing room to engage in negotiations before the sanction procedures begin, the opposition of several members of the League of Nations to the report of the Five-Nation Special Committee makes it difficult to be optimistic. The recommendations of the Thirteen-Nation Committee will not even be as lenient in their treatment of Mussolini as the recommendations of the Five-Nation Special Committee. At the same time, the recent rumor that France allowed private loans to Italy has been denied by relevant parties. It is reported that the Bank of France recently reached an agreement with the Italian government to recover 500 million francs of French government bonds from the Italian government. The rumor may have originated from this. It is believed that these government bonds will be sold on the French market. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

But the League of Nations has now taken this resolute action. The New York Times' tone was similar, saying that if Mussolini felt he was strong enough to confront the League of Nations, he should not have submitted the case to Geneva for adjudication.

<p>Italian Representative Remains in Geneva</p>
<p>Awaits League of Nations Developments</p>
<p>Withdrawing from the League is Also Within Expectations to Maintain Prestige</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council has resolved to take measures in accordance with the Covenant to prevent Italy's aggressive actions in East Africa. According to Article 12 of the Covenant, Italy must wait three months after the Executive Council issues a report before declaring war on Ethiopia. However, it is doubtful whether Italian officials will be able to delay the date of their initiation of hostilities due to this provision. According to sources in Rome, well-informed observers say that Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations is only a matter of time, or it must accept the recommendations of the Five-Nation Committee. Powerful figures in Italy also said today, "This situation in Geneva is within expectations. Italy is prepared to deal with everything." (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The League of Nations Executive Council's decision yesterday to have a thirteen-member committee draft a report and make recommendations on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute without Italy's consent has not been much discussed here, as it is seen as within expectations. A responsible source told a Reuters reporter today that the Italian representative will remain in Geneva to await the results of the committee's discussion, but we do not have much hope. After one committee, another committee follows. This is the usual practice in Geneva, but the second group will be in a more powerful position to start working with Italy, as the Five-Nation Special Committee's report has already acknowledged that Ethiopia cannot govern its own affairs.</p>
<p>The Italian Daily published an article by Gaida, saying that the League of Nations Covenant can be applied to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute in two ways: one is to implement the first three sections of Article 16, which is what those who generally oppose Italy's actions use to justify sanctions; the other is to implement the fourth section of Article 16, which states that "Any member of the League which has violated any provision of the Covenant may be declared to be no longer a member of the League by a vote of the representatives of all other members of the League represented on the Executive Council." Gaida's article also mentions Article 19: "The Assembly may from time to time advise the members of the League to reconsider treaties that have become inapplicable and international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world." If the League of Nations decides to implement the first three sections of Article 16, which stipulate that "The other members undertake immediately and subject to the provisions of Article 17, to subject such covenant-breaking State to the severest forms of exclusion from intercourse with the members of the League," and "It shall be the duty of the Executive Council in such case to recommend to the several governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League," and "The members of the League agree to afford one another mutual support in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures," then it is feared that it will trigger a second world war. This is the general view held by responsible parties here. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The League of Nations Executive Council's decision to organize a committee to draft recommendations in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant without Italy's consent is highly valued by political circles here. The semi-official Italian Daily officially declared that the Italian government has repeatedly stated that it reserves the freedom of action. The memorandum and declaration of September 4 have already clarified Italy's attitude. Therefore, since that date, it has no longer been concerned with the facts that have been said or have been done. Italy cannot recognize the principle that the League of Nations must resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Japan has also refused to recognize this principle, but it has not been heard that the League of Nations has taken any steps or caused the hostility of the great powers. Ethiopia uses Article 15 of the Covenant as the basis for its application, but there is also the fourth section of Article 16, which stipulates the expulsion of any member state that violates the Covenant. In addition, Article 19 also stipulates that member states may reconsider treaties that are impractical and agreements that endanger world peace. The above-mentioned provisions provide for the adjustment of land for the sake of peace and progress. This theory is based on the Covenant, so there is sufficient reason to apply it to Ethiopia. Italy has not openly demanded to invoke this treaty, but the evidence in Italy's memorandum and its own interests have clearly told the League of Nations about this matter, awaiting the judgment of the civilized world. The various facts that have occurred in Geneva before prove that there is a pre-determined plan, the purpose of which is to put Italy in the position of an aggressor country, so that collective sanctions can be imposed on it.

<p>British Cabinet Studies</p>
<p>Impact of Sanctions Against Italy</p>
<p>General Observation: War in East Africa is Inevitable</p>
<p>(London) What impact will Britain have if it imposes sanctions on Italy? This question is currently being studied by the relevant departments of the cabinet. It is reported that the authorities have investigated the impact that the severance of trade relations between Britain and Italy may have on various merchants. The results of the investigation prove that the economic severance between Britain and Italy will cause significant losses to British industry and commerce. Some factories will be forced to close, and the number of unemployed workers will increase by 50,000. In addition, there are quite a few British expatriates doing business in Italy. If Britain and Italy sever economic ties, the British currency deposits that these expatriates have in banks will be forcibly converted into Italian currency by the Italian authorities, and the losses will inevitably be huge. In addition, the British government is consulting with the governments of other relevant countries, asking whether those countries are prepared to sever trade relations with Italy. The majority of countries replied that they approve of it, but some countries with economic difficulties said that if they want to sever economic ties with Italy, they must find other ways to sell their goods, so that they can compensate for the loss of the Italian market. Yugoslavia is one example, as the majority of the livestock produced in Yugoslavia is exported to Italy. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) London's cautious political observers are now clearly expressing their fears that the Italo-Ethiopian war cannot be avoided in the end. It is expected that when the war breaks out, Britain will implement sanctions of a very moderate nature. After the Italian army wins the first victory, it will ask the League of Nations to actively intervene, hoping that Mussolini can be more rational at that time. However, Britain clearly wants to maintain its naval strength in the Mediterranean, and will even reinforce it with warships stationed in the Chinese sea. At the same time, the strength of the garrisons in Malta, Sudan, Gibraltar, and Haifa is sufficient. The wives and children of the soldiers are now being transported back to their home country or to areas that are slightly less dangerous. It is expected that the Italian army will advance on two fronts until the last hour, passing through Afghanistan like a pair of scissors, and heading straight from the southern tip of Italian Somaliland to Harar, where the Ethiopian army's headquarters is located.

<p>British Politician Churchill</p>
<p>Advises Italy to Pull Back from the Brink</p>
<p>Condemns Italian Military Actions as a Great Imprudence</p>
<p>Strongly Opposes the Redistribution of Colonies</p>
<p>Advocates for British Military Expansion to Cope with the European Situation</p>
<p>(London) British politician Churchill warned Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today in a speech in London about the dangers of Italy's current actions in Ethiopia. He said, "I speak as a sincere friend of Italy. What I find deeply strange is that a politician of such great wisdom as Mussolini is willing to risk putting his glorious country in an unpleasant position militarily and financially, committing a great imprudence on the world, sending 250,000 soldiers far away to the desert coast 2,000 miles from the country, and without naval hegemony, this is simply gambling with history in an unprecedented way. The dangers that Italy is currently facing will last for several years. Italy will one day thank Britain for preventing it from falling into a deadly trap. Italy's current actions will make it no longer among the ranks of European powers, which is something I am especially reluctant to say. The US government has now clearly announced that there is no question of Britain acting alone, and I welcome this very much. I am confident that the entire British Empire is ready to assist the British government in upholding the authority of the League of Nations in accordance with Britain's obligations. It would be a great fortune for all countries if the League of Nations could achieve a peaceful resolution." Churchill went on to talk about Germany's plan to rearm, and that it is especially appropriate to strengthen British defenses, especially the British Air Force. He felt that the British Navy would be able to perform any of its duties within a year or two, but in the future, it would have to be prepared. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Churchill, former Minister of the Navy and a member of the Conservative Party's opposition faction, recently gave a speech at a banquet held by the London City Council. He vehemently opposed the proposal to redistribute the world's colonies, saying, "If all of our country's autonomous territories and colonies were redistributed, then the ancestral heritage inherited by our country's ancestors would be shattered and dispersed. What would be left for our country would be just this poor little island, using the empty name of a great power to amuse itself. Thinking of this, how can one not feel chilled?"

<p>(London) The British Admiralty has sought to increase the strength of the Mediterranean Fleet in recent days, especially by increasing the number of mine-laying vessels and mine-sweeping vessels. Several battleships have now been concentrated in the ports of Gibraltar and Suez, and mine-laying vessels, cruisers, and destroyers have been concentrated on the island of Malta to prevent attacks by Italian submarines. The aircraft carrier "Hermes" has sailed from the coast of China to Singapore, and the cruiser "Berwick" of the British fleet stationed in China has sailed to the port of Aden. In addition, the Admiralty is rushing to negotiate with various foreign governments in order to obtain the assistance of various foreign countries if necessary. If the island of Malta is bombed by Italian aircraft, the British fleet will not be able to find a dock to repair the damaged ships. The Admiralty, seeing this, believes that the two naval docks in Toulon, France, and Bizerte, French Tunisia, are well suited to the urgent needs of the British fleet. For this reason, it will soon negotiate with France in order to obtain its assistance. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>A visitor to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, declared that Ethiopia has the custom of holding a celebration ceremony called the "Makar Festival" every year after the end of the rainy season. Its nature is religious and military, and it is used to encourage Christian patriotism. This year's celebration ceremony was held today, and its significance is even more significant, because the war between Italy and Ethiopia is imminent. The end of the rainy season is almost a signal to meet on the battlefield. The general public believes that although the rainy season has passed, the fields and rivers are still muddy, and military operations are still not suitable within two weeks. Ethiopia is currently calm on the surface, and although it has expressed its trust in the League of Nations, it has prepared everything to deal with the situation. For example, it is sparing no effort in conscripting soldiers, and the whole country is preparing for war. The "Women's Aid to the Army Committee" is preparing food for the soldiers at the front. It recently issued a notice to women across the country, advising them to prepare dry food for the soldiers to meet emergency needs. (27th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>The Third Day of the Liu Zigu Painting Exhibition, Sponsored by the Education and Social Affairs Bureaus</p>

Yesterday was the third day, and the number of visitors was greater than the previous two days.

A reporter from the Central News Agency, believing that Liu's ability to publicly exhibit his masterpieces in Shanghai was a rare opportunity, visited a gentleman in the office of the exhibition and was told the following:</p>
<p>Exhibition Motivation</p>
<p>Mr. Liu was originally a loyal comrade of the Party who has been working hard for the revolution for many years and has achieved great results. However, he is good at painting and often paints in his spare time. He has been working hard for 20 years. Last winter, at the invitation of a friend in Nanjing, he held a solo exhibition for five days, with more than 200 works on display. Tens of thousands of people from all walks of life visited, and it was a sensation. This time, he responded to the invitation of the Municipal Education and Social Affairs Bureaus to hold a solo exhibition in Shanghai, not to promote personal achievements, but to promote Chinese art and attract social attention.</p>
<p>Founding a Painting Academy</p>
<p>Mr. Liu believes that Chinese painting has a glorious history of thousands of years, but the current painting style is declining and becoming increasingly low. If we do not engage in a revival movement, it will not be enough to save it. Therefore, he is willing to dedicate his personal ability to seek social assistance, dedicate himself to art, establish a painting academy, gather painting talents, and study and learn from each other, so that we can restore the national culture. The origin of this idea was greatly supported and deeply sympathized by the leaders of the Party and the country, such as Yu Youren, Li Shizeng, Dai Jitao, and Wang Jingwei.</p>
<p>Criticism from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's works are known for landscapes, orchids, and bamboos. His landscapes mostly follow the masculine style of the Northern School, with sharp outlines and textures, washing away the current bad habits and worthy of being a master of the era. His orchids and bamboos are vigorous and upright, worthy of succeeding the mantle of Su Nan and Banqiao. Chairman Lin once wrote "Renowned in Painting," Zhang Ji wrote "Brush Pursues the Northern Song," and Wu Zhihui wrote "Following the Steps of Jing Guan," praising the three Wangs. In addition, Yu Youren, Chen Lifu, Ye Chucang, and Shao Yuanchong all had excellent criticisms of Mr. Liu's works.</p>

<p>Ancient Pottery Discovered in Zhenru and Fanwangdu: To Be Sent to the Museum for Display Upon Its Establishment: Several Archaeologists to Go to Jinshan for Investigation</p>
<p>According to Guomin News, archaeologists Wei Juxian, Zhang Feng, and others recently discovered various ancient pottery pieces near Daxia University in Fanwangdu and Xintun of Jinan University in Zhenru, proving that Shanghai's culture was already remarkable in the Han Dynasty. According to Mr. Wei's words to Guomin News reporters, Shanghai's culture, as seen in ancient books, began in the Tang Dynasty, and it is difficult to investigate before the Tang Dynasty. However, the pottery fragments recently discovered in Zhenru and Fanwangdu have the same patterns as those in Zhabu in Anhui Province, Qixia Mountain in the capital, and the pottery recently discovered in Jinshan, Songjiang, and have already been proven by archaeologists from the north and south to be Han Dynasty relics. Moreover, these ancient relics are very different from those in the north, which further shows the difference between northern and southern cultures. These discovered pottery pieces will all be sent to the Municipal Museum for preservation after its completion, for research. According to Mr. Wei, in order to conduct further research on the ancient relics discovered in Jinshanwei, Jinshan County, Songjiang, he will go to Jinshan tomorrow with Zhang Feng, Jin Zutong, Chen Zhiliang, and others to inspect them. Mr. Wei also told reporters that the pottery fragments discovered in Jinshan were all found on the beach three miles west of Jinshanwei Beach. The area was formerly land called Chu Kangwang City, and there was also the Kanghuang Chidao Road next to it, which is now submerged in the sea for six or seven miles. The Jinshan in the sea was also formerly on land. This trip to Jinshan County will include a visit to Jinshan.</p>

According to a participant, bedbugs are</p>

They disembarked at the Customs Wharf via a ferry. Those who came to welcome them included Karlson, Stoke, Chen Qihao, Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai, Pike, Mrs. Ha Liqi, Defu, Mrs. Kai Tuo, Yu Hengzhi, Zhong Yongshen, and hundreds of relatives and friends. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The lawn tennis club requested Mr. Chen Qihao to represent them in receiving the ship and providing all accommodations. After disembarking, Li and the others shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcoming party and then took cars directly to the French Chamber of Commerce to practice and stretch their muscles.</p>
<p>Li Huitang's Remarks</p>
<p>After disembarking, the "King of Soccer" Li Huitang made the following remarks: "This trip is to represent Hong Kong in the port city netball competition and has nothing to do with the National Games. None of the five members of the delegation are Westerners, making it a purely Chinese representative team, which is rare. Due to work commitments, I cannot stay for long. As for the Hong Kong soccer team for the National Games, it has already been officially formed and is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month. The original position of inside forward was to be filled by me, but whether I can participate at that time is still undecided and will depend on whether I can get leave from my job. Of the five of us, besides myself staying at Lin Baohua's home, Jia Liu will temporarily reside at the Yangtze Hotel, and Xu Wei Pei and others will reside at Chen Qihao's Rongpu," and so on.</p>
<p>A Performance at Rongpu on the 1st</p>
<p>Mr. Stoke of the Lawn Tennis Club has specially arranged for the Hong Kong athletes to demonstrate their skills at Rongpu at 2:30 PM on September 1st, after the completion of the port city competition. Four famous players, Karlson, Defu, Skya, and Stoke, will be assigned by Mr. Stoke. On the Chinese side, Mr. Chen Qihao will arrange for several promising new players to compete against the Hong Kong representatives. Mr. Chen Qihao plans to invite Zhang Dingchuang, Chen Zhiqiang,  Jie, Ma Anquan, Chen Yi, Luo Min, and others to Rongpu at that time to assist in the battle. The details will be finalized next Tuesday, and journalists are welcome to visit.</p>

<p>Five Years Apart</p>
<p>(Li Huitang)</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the port city netball team was officially formed, and the date of departure from Hong Kong was also decided. The news made my heart flutter with joy, like a deer that has been thirsty for a long time suddenly finding a spring.</p>
<p>Naturally, after being away from a place for a full five years, anyone would be happy and excited to have the opportunity to visit it again. Especially Shanghai, which has special connections to me, with its soccer fate, love and friendship, sweet and sour memories, and everything else that makes me dream of revisiting the old place.</p>
<p>Seeing the Wusong Estuary, I tipped my hat in greeting. My eyes aimlessly admired the scenery on both sides of the river. "The peach blossoms still smile in the spring breeze." Although there have not been any major changes in the past five years, the lingering scars are enough to make my heart ache. I quickly took a small steamer, passed Yangshupu, Broadway, Waibaidu Bridge, the Bund, and arrived at the New Customs Wharf, which I had entered and exited many times. On the surface, Shanghai is still as bustling as ever. Besides a few new buildings, I cannot see any major changes.</p>
<p>After shaking hands with my old and new friends who came to welcome me, they all politely said, "Old Li is still energetic and full of vigor." Indeed, I have been away from Shanghai for a full five years. Although I have nothing to boast about, I have been well, thanks to blessings. I have gained more than twenty pounds, and my big belly is alarming. Although I have not yet begun to think about things, I do not have a single white hair, but I already feel the sense of time passing and old age approaching. Other than that, I myself cannot see any concrete changes in me in the past five years. Perhaps because I have experienced more of the world, my views on life and society are more adaptable and tolerant. Yuan Zhonglang said it well, "A man at thirty should not have an empty purse, an empty granary, a humble dwelling, or a meager diet. Shameful!" I ask myself, although my clothing, food, and housing are better than the bottom but not as good as the top, "I have accomplished nothing and half a lifetime has passed." In addition to feeling ashamed, I often warn and encourage myself to achieve something soon.</p>
<p>People only know that I have made contributions and achievements in soccer. This time, I suddenly represent netball in the port city competition, which inevitably surprises many compatriots. Indeed, even I myself never dreamed of participating in the port city netball competition. Compared to the skills of Xu Lin, Qiu Zheng, and other national players, I am like playing a cloth drum to pass through an electric gate, making a fool of myself. I only hope that my friends will not have excessive expectations of my skills and will not be overly critical when my performance is not satisfactory. You must know that my netball is still a novice's effort, and my level is still very young, unlike my considerable achievements and natural confidence in soccer.</p>
<p>My great desire to learn netball started when I met Lin Baohua on the soccer team's expedition to Australia in the 16th year of the Republic of China. After returning to China, I gradually improved and became interested with the patient guidance of Lin Qiu and others and the exchanges and enlightenment of Jiang Daozhang, Zheng Zhaojia, and others. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, I won the Shanghai Open Hard Court Doubles Championship with Lao Jiang, which was my first unexpected harvest. After returning south that year, my netball was not yet very noticeable. It was not until the last Hong Kong Open that I defeated the four-year runner-up "Fen Zha" (who had defeated the world women's champion Mrs. Helen Marty) in one battle and won the current champion "Lin Zhen" in another (the last game led by five to three and ended in a loss of eight to six). This is when people were surprised by my rapid progress and the eyes of the port city selection committee were drawn to me. Speaking of this championship, the Shanghai team can of course take it into their pockets, as easy as turning their hands. Our Hong Kong team's singles and doubles champions cannot come north due to events, and their strength is inevitably slightly affected. However, the Shanghai team has excellent talents and unparalleled strength. Even if they could come, it would still be like hitting a stone with an egg, sending a sheep into the tiger's mouth, or meat on the chopping block. It will be clear in a few days. Let's see how thick our luck is and how many bald eggs we will consume. (The strength of our women's team is still good, or we can regain some face.)</p>
<p>My good friends at home and abroad, whether in conversations or in letters, are all eager to inquire about the World Games soccer event and ask if I will make a comeback this year and prepare to participate. Their enthusiastic concern for the overall situation and for me personally is truly touching. When I talk about soccer, I get excited. Whether or not to send a team to the World Games is, of course, a major issue that everyone wants to know. Whether I will return to the field is also of great concern to the people of the soccer world. In my opinion, these two things are closely related, because if there is no World Games soccer, I would have followed the advice of my doctors and family and retired to avoid hindering the opportunities of the younger generation. To go on an expedition and participate in the World Games has been my great wish in my heart for more than ten years, a beautiful dream that I have been thinking about every day since adulthood that has not yet come true. Five years ago, I once hit a snag and the plan failed and was forced to stop halfway, but that failure was not enough to make me discouraged or dampen my courage and great desire to continue moving forward. This time, the embers have rekindled, and it is rare to have a good opportunity, so how can I let it pass? Although I dare not boast that I will definitely pass the selection, "I will ring the bell as long as I am a monk for a day." I will do as much as I can with the strength I have. I cannot but strive to try with the principle of "only by sowing seeds can there be a harvest."</p>
<p>Some people think that I am "old." Indeed, time flies, and no one can avoid old age and weakness. I am not a superman, how dare I be conceited and extraordinary, and how can I escape this common rule? However, I have only just passed the "thirty" age. Rather than saying that I am old, it is better to say that my golden age has passed or will pass. I will admit and accept this. What I regret most is that I contracted severe pleurisy when I was in Nanyang two years ago, which deprived me of a lot of the physique and health that I used to pride myself on. Perhaps that was due to excessive exercise and carelessness, but what can I say about fate?</p>
<p>Fortunately, recently when the Shanghai team returned from a trip to the north and passed through Hong Kong, I volunteered to make a guest appearance because my thighs were growing back. A few days ago, I also represented South China in a friendly match once. Although I have not played this tune for a long time, I did not feel very rusty when I played. I still had 90% confidence in my control, and the public and the soccer world praised and marveled, saying that "Old Li's sword is not old and his heroic demeanor is still the same." On the one hand, I secretly rejoiced and took it as a great favor. On the other hand, I made plans for the future to live up to the expectations of the public.</p>
<p>Raising the issue of sending a soccer team is both important and complicated, and it cannot be resolved hastily like cutting through tangled hemp with a sharp knife. Before and after, there must be sufficient research and preparation, meticulous planning and organization. For example, it is important to carefully select and retain the best talents, to properly plan for skills training, to find the right person to lead the team, to guarantee leave of absence for various occupations, to carefully plan the travel arrangements and budget, and to take care of the true meaning of sportsmanship and personality. These are the major points, and there are other trivial issues that I will discuss in detail in the future if I have the time. I think the biggest focus is on leave, followed by talent, and the economic aspect is relatively easy to handle. In short, if within and outside the country, there is still mutual suspicion and outward agreement but inward disagreement, if we do not remove prejudices and work together, then we will fail and the traces of the past will still be fresh in our minds, and it will be easy to fall into the trap. Isn't that sad and regrettable?</p>
<p>Many people pessimistically say that the level of soccer in our country is like a small witch seeing a great witch compared to Europe and South America. Why bother wasting energy, money, and effort to form a team to show off our shame? The vision of these people is small, like worms in a cow's stomach, measuring the breadth and length of the world, which is laughable. Although we are very clear that our country has no hope of winning the championship in the World Games soccer competition, compared with all kinds of sports, it seems that only soccer can compete with others and attract attention, unlike other sports with standards, where the results are compared, and the superiority and inferiority are immediately judged. Moreover, soccer is the most interesting sport in the world. After the World Games, we can take advantage of the opportunity to conduct a grand publicity campaign in various countries, praising the progress of our new youth, changing the negative impression of China, and establishing friendly relations with all parties. It can be said to be beneficial without any disadvantages. Therefore, I say that unless our authorities are willing to give up on themselves and regard the World Games as nothing, we must be determined to eliminate all obstacles and achieve great success in sending a soccer team, no matter how many thorns there are in the road ahead. We must not be afraid of difficulties and seek temporary ease, so that this sports delegation that benefits our country will not feel like they cannot move forward and miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>The National Games to be held in the coming days has attracted soccer players from home and abroad, almost all of whom will attend and participate, melting the elite into one furnace, giving the authorities an opportunity to review, which is like a prelude to the World Games. After the meeting, the issue of selecting talents will be clear and most of it can be resolved. The authorities must have a plan in mind, make careful calculations, and plan early. All related parties must join hands and work together to achieve great success. Then, sincerity will open gold and stone, and "there will be times when you can break through the waves," which is my most heartfelt and sincere wish for this return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Finally, I express my gratitude and respect to my friends in Shanghai for their love and guidance. After leaving for a few years, I feel a bit lost, like an infant who has lost its nanny, and I feel even more grateful when I think about it. The ancients said, "For example, those who rest under a good tree forget its shade. Once they lose it, they feel the red dust and the white sun." This theory is true. This time, I have the opportunity to come again, and I warmly hope that on the one hand, I can enhance the friendship of old friends, and on the other hand, I can make more good and beneficial friends. I hope that all sectors will be generous with their advice and teach me. (Written in transit three hours after arriving in Shanghai)</p>

<p>Excessive Stomach Acid in Modern Medicine Journals Physician Yu Bofu This disease is clinically experienced to affect mostly young female patients. It often occurs with chlorosis and general neurological symptoms. Such as mental exhaustion, neurasthenia, or due to improper diet, bile secretion disorders, chronic intestinal diseases, and other causes. Many are prone to this disease. Symptoms of onset often occur two or three hours after eating. Heartburn, acidic belching, burning sensation in the stomach, and a feeling of fullness. Vomiting, stomach pain, etc. If given alkaline foods such as milk, eggs, meat, etc., relief is immediately seen. This is because alkali neutralizes the acid. However, complete cure cannot be relied upon. The diagnosis of this disease is not very difficult. The more difficult part is distinguishing whether it is a simple secretory dysfunction. Palpation reveals a heavy pain sensation, but often there is little sensation when the stomach is empty. Try taking the stomach contents after eating for examination. The acid value is particularly high, ranging from 80 to 100 or even exceeding that. However, the gastric motility of this disease remains very good. If it encounters starch, it will cause digestive disorders. The treatment of this condition, in addition to general therapy, includes food, mechanical devices, and the special medicine "Stomach Pain Relief Pill," etc. Anemia and Seminal Emission Physician Zhou Xiaohan Blood forms essence, and essence nourishes blood. Therefore, essence and blood are the two great treasures of the human body. Neither can be deficient. If blood dries up, the face becomes sallow and the muscles thin, leading to premature aging. If essence is exhausted, it causes back pain and neurasthenia. Today, there are many who suffer from anemia and seminal emission. Those who treat them often do not find the right method, resulting in no great effect. It is essential to know that the depletion of essence and blood is caused by the decline of the body's own ability to produce essence and blood. Therefore, the treatment method that promotes the blood-producing and essence-producing functions with gonadal hormone is the most effective. However, seminal emission should be addressed first. It is advisable to first take Himitol's seminal emission control tablets to strengthen the seminal gate. A Major Cause of Infertility Physician Ren Guoxiang According to the principle of male and female essence uniting to create all things, there should be no infertility when men and women mate. However, many middle-aged couples today have been married for many years but still have no children, bearing the sorrow of Bo Dao. Why is this so? According to my clinical experience, it is all because women are physically weak and unable to conceive, suffering from leukorrhea, making them unable to be fertilized. Generally, women who are physically weak suffer from vaginal discharge. Hence, there is the saying "nine out of ten women have vaginal discharge." Those who suffer from leukorrhea have a type of acidic pus secreted in the vagina that kills sperm, naturally leading to hopelessness for childbirth. I often first instruct them to use Leukorrhea Relief externally to cure their leukorrhea, and then administer a large amount of female gonadal hormone to make their bodies healthy and beautiful. Often within half a year, they happily report their pregnancy and express their gratitude repeatedly. (Note) Female gonadal hormone is not yet sold in pharmacies. It must be purchased directly from Anliss Foreign Company. I heard the price is also six yuan. Treatment for Thinness and Frequent Illness Contributed by Qiu Jialu When I, the humble writer, drafted this article, I recalled the situation a year ago, as if I had escaped from death. At that time, I was driven by the need for food and clothing with a thin and sickly body, and I had to work hard. I was exhausted and declining, indescribably. At night, dreams and illusions arose repeatedly, and I suffered from nocturnal emissions. I was in extreme distress. I took all kinds of tonics and injections, but although the empty bottles piled up like mountains, and both of my thighs were like beehives, the effectiveness was still equal to zero. The illness worsened day by day, and I resigned myself to death. Later, I read in the newspaper that Physician Zhou Xiaohan had cured similar diseases with gonadal hormone. I immediately found out where it was sold and bought two boxes. I took it according to the instructions. Unexpectedly, beyond my expectations, after taking one box, I felt a surge of new energy, and most of the disease was gone. After taking two boxes, my weight increased, my muscles became full, and my waist and back became strong. Therefore, for complete assurance, I took another box to achieve full effect. This year, I returned to my hometown for a matter, and those who saw me looked at me as if they did not know me, marveling at the speed of the change in my appearance. Report on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Venereal Diseases Medical Doctor Yao Erchang, Doctor of Medicine, Benzewenni University, USA (Clinic) Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road The Pain of Insomnia and Forgetfulness Patient: Rong Zhengxiu, 36 years old, from Ningbo, working in the industry. (Chief complaint) - Weak brain, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus. (Medical history) - The body has always been considered strong. Three years ago, due to social engagements, he occasionally ventured into brothels and contracted venereal disease. Although the disease was cured with injections and medication, his vitality was greatly damaged. Initially, he felt soreness in his waist and back, followed by blurred vision and tinnitus. Occasionally, after working for a slightly longer period, he felt extremely tired. He could not sleep peacefully at night and would wake up at the slightest noise. During the day, he was also drowsy and sleepy. He often forgot things that had happened, which he found very distressing. Later, introduced by a colleague, he came to me for treatment. (Present condition) - Nocturnal emission, insomnia, weak brain, neurasthenia. Presenting a state of hyperexcitation. (Treatment) - Diagnosed with neurasthenia. Administered Himitol's seminal emission control tablets, and the nocturnal emission was cured. Then, a large amount of gonadal hormone was administered. Before three boxes were finished, his brainpower was abundant, his waist and back were strong, he slept peacefully at night, his memory recovered, and he did not feel tired even after working a little. Frequent Seminal Emission Upon Seeing Beauty, Kidney Deficiency, and Sore Waist Patient: Mr. Hu Xinya, 19 years old, from Beiping, in the academic world. (Chief complaint) - Loose spermatic duct, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation. (Medical history) - He developed as early as thirteen years old. Due to the poison of erotic books, he mistakenly committed masturbation, which caused severe damage. Initially, he did not take it seriously. At sixteen, he had intercourse with a woman and ejaculated immediately. This happened repeatedly, and he began to realize his deficiency. He strictly abstained from masturbation, but the root was already beyond help. Initially, he would ejaculate upon seeing beauty, then he would ejaculate even when his private parts were touched by clothing. Worse still, he would ejaculate even when slightly stimulated or encountering unpleasant things. He also frequently suffered from nocturnal emissions at night. At this point, his body was extremely weak and exhausted, his waist was sore, and his private parts were weak and excited, making him restless whether sitting or standing. He had taken various life-preserving agents, but they had no effect. Later, introduced by his brother-in-law, he came to me for treatment. (Present condition) - Sexual neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, nocturnal emission. (Treatment) - In addition to scientific radio wave surgery, a large amount of Himitol's seminal emission control tablets were administered, along with Steinach's gonadal hormone. After more than seven weeks, all symptoms were gone, and his kidneys were also healthy. Random Notes After Diagnosis (Physician Ren Guoxiang) 1. The Treatment Process for Premature Aging Patient: Qian Weisheng, 27 years old, a teacher in a certain vocational school. He looked like he was in his forties. According to him, he developed very early as a child and was led astray by friends. At the age of fourteen, he mistakenly developed the habit of masturbation. Later, realizing the harm, he abstained, but nocturnal emissions came frequently and continued for several years without interruption. As a result, his body became unhealthy. He occasionally experienced palpitations and insomnia. He had headaches in the front and back of his head, as well as tinnitus and blurred vision, and he was prone to forgetfulness. Now, his hair was gray and fell out easily. Thinking about the future, he felt dark and hopeless, with no interest in life, as if he were a useless person. This spring, introduced by a friend, he came for treatment. I examined him thoroughly and found that his kidneys were too severely deficient. As a result, his vitality was greatly damaged, and he was easily attacked by all kinds of diseases. I specially prescribed Steinach's gonadal hormone tonic, suitable for all seasons, and instructed him to take two Himitol's seminal emission control tablets one hour before bedtime. According to his subsequent report, the nocturnal emissions stopped immediately, his spirit gradually recovered, and his limbs became strong. Now, all diseases have disappeared, and he has regained his youth. 2. Nocturnal Emission Should Be Treated Quickly Essence is formed from blood. Losing too much of it often leads to kidney deficiency and a weak body, or mental decline, fatigue, and weakness, reduced appetite, resulting in malnutrition and weakened resistance, making one prone to illness. For example, last winter, there was a patient surnamed Ma who, due to youthful indiscretion, had excessive sexual desire. Later, realizing the harm, he abstained, but suddenly suffered from nocturnal emissions. Initially, it was only four or five times a month, but over time, it became more and more severe. Later, there was not a night without it. After a month, his body was overwhelmed, his face was sallow and thin, his head was dizzy and swollen, and he was lifeless, as if he had a serious illness. He was very bitter and regretted not seeking treatment sooner. Later, he sought treatment, and he was injected with various health-preserving and strengthening agents, which only had a temporary effect and did not completely restore his health. Nocturnal emission was especially severe, sometimes improving and sometimes recurring. This April, he came to me for examination. I immediately prescribed a large amount of Himitol's seminal emission control tablets. After finishing one bottle, the disease was reduced by half. Continuing to take three bottles, the nocturnal emission was completely cured. I also instructed him to take gonadal hormone internally to make up for the deficiency. After taking four bottles, he has now completely recovered his health and is full of energy. Questions Regarding Smoking Cessation and Recuperation (Editor) Everyone knows how harmful opium is. Smokers only seek temporary pain relief and alleviation of illness. After smoking for a long time, they become addicted and cannot quit. Chronically poisoned by the smoke, they become sallow and thin, with faces full of smoke, sinking into the darkness, unable to help themselves. It is truly pitiful. Recently, Chairman Chiang ordered the eradication of opium, in order to avoid harming the people and weakening the country. It was carried out vigorously, with a deadline for eradication. As a result, the general smokers, aware of the dangerous future, competed to quit. However, because they had been accustomed to it for so long, once they quit, the mental and physical pain was extreme. As a result, some would quit and then relapse, or all kinds of complications would arise after quitting, making them regard smoking cessation as a daunting task. This is because they do not know the method of recuperation, so they cannot achieve complete success. Gonadal hormone is not only a tonic for the weak, but it also has a great effect during and after smoking cessation. During smoking cessation, taking gonadal hormone internally can strengthen the body and eliminate the causes of all complications. After smoking cessation, taking gonadal hormone internally can further promote the body's ability to eliminate smoke toxins, allowing it to quickly regain health. Our clinical experience has shown that gonadal hormone is used to achieve satisfactory results for the various symptoms caused by smoking cessation. Nocturnal Emission Saved Contributed by Chen Sijiu When I was young, I was dashing and self-admiring. I had a beautiful wife at home and many romantic encounters outside. The activities were inevitably excessive, and I gradually felt deficient and overwhelmed. However, I could not stop. As a result, my waist was sore and my back ached, and I often suffered from nocturnal emissions at night. Sometimes I even had emissions without dreaming. During the day, I would ejaculate at the slightest excitement. I was panicked and confused and hastily took medicines without careful consideration. I mistakenly took a kidney-tonifying pill that was supposedly nourishing yang but was actually strengthening yang. This made the damage even worse. I consulted doctors and had injections, but they were ineffective. Later, thanks to my brother Jin Shibin's introduction, I went to Zhengwei Pharmacy and bought Himitol's seminal emission control tablets. After two boxes, the nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea disappeared. Furthermore, I followed the instructions of Physician Ren Guoxiang and took gonadal hormone to replenish myself. Before finishing four boxes, my waist was no longer sore, and I did not ejaculate prematurely even during intercourse. These two medicines are truly the greatest saviors for patients with nocturnal emission. Pessimism Is Also a Symptom of Neurasthenia Physician Yu Bofu Patient: Mr. Guan Hongfu, from Si'an. He used to work in the education field. He was physically weak. His kind mother died early, and there were many misfortunes in the family. His stepmother's tyranny filled the sky. Mr. Guan's nerves were severely stimulated, forming symptoms such as palpitations, dreaminess, and numbness in his feet. He often had cold sweats. He was pessimistic about everything. As a result, his body became even thinner, his brainpower was insufficient, and he suffered from insomnia and forgetfulness, unable to concentrate. Introduced by his close friend Mr. Jin, he came to me for treatment. I examined his nerves and found that they were extremely weak. I immediately prescribed a large amount of gonadal hormone for him to take internally. Before finishing three boxes, all the above symptoms were eliminated. Now, his complexion is rosy, his spirit is full, and he is positive about everything, taking an optimistic attitude. He deeply feels that his previous pessimism and negativity were actually a pathological effect. One of the Emergency Common Senses Editor (1) Fainting Fainting, commonly known as dizziness, is different from stroke (commonly known as apoplexy). It is in the opposite position. Fainting is caused by a lack of blood in the brain. Its symptoms are blocked Qi, cold extremities, pallor, and dilated pupils. Those with mild symptoms can get up on their own after a short while. Those with severe symptoms may be in danger of death. The causes are generally anemia, hunger, overwork, and severe stimulation. The method of first aid is to make the person lie flat on their back with their head slightly lower. The indoor temperature should not be too high. Keep it quiet. Loosen the clothing. Splash cold water on the face and chest, or use ammonia water to make them inhale. If they can drink, brandy and strong tea can be given. After waking up, they should be comforted mentally, and gonadal hormone should be taken regularly to make their body strong, so that there will be no future troubles. Questions and Answers About Diseases (Manuscripts must include detailed addresses) (And attach return postage) Sleepy During the Day Mr. Bei asks: I committed masturbation when I was young. Now I often feel headaches and blurred vision. My limbs are weak. I feel sleepy during the day. There is tinnitus in my ears. I am as thin as a stick. My face is pale and lifeless. (Omitted below) Answer: Your illness is neurasthenia. You should take gonadal hormone to treat it. Stop masturbating. Many Illusions at Night Sun Jingjiu asks: I have been having many illusions at night for the past year or two. I also have occasional nocturnal emissions. Please tell me the treatment method. Answer: Your illness is kidney deficiency and neurasthenia. Take two Himitol's seminal emission control tablets before going to bed until the nocturnal emission stops. Also take gonadal hormone to treat neurasthenia, and you can achieve complete success. Mistakenly Eating Rotten Food Mr. Yu Runsheng asks: This summer, I mistakenly ate leftover dishes. After eating, I saw mold and small worms on the bottom of the bowl. Since then, I have had stomach problems. I have taken Ten Drops of Water, etc., but the pain still occurs from time to time. Answer: Ten Drops of Water cannot cure stomach problems. You should take the special medicine for stomach problems, Stomach Pain Relief Pill, to treat it.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Commentary: China Should At Least Learn from Dogs Meng Ruo Mr. Wu Zhihui usually doesn't speak, but when he does, his words are always clever and contain some humor. This time, the old gentleman went to the old capital for sightseeing and talked with the newly opened reporters. In addition to saying something like "The great flood was caused by Dayu harming people, and the idea of establishing the country on agriculture is no longer valid. The only magic weapon for saving the country is science," he finally said with great emotion, "It is certainly not easy for China to pretend to be a tiger or a lion, but at least it should learn from a dog, because when you want to beat a dog to death, you have to make a considerable sacrifice." China has been pretending to be a tiger or a lion for a long time. In the past, we used to regard ourselves as tigers or lions. This is not something I made up out of thin air. Many foreigners often say that China is a country of lions, but this lion is a sleeping lion. In fact, since the Opium War, this sleeping lion has become a sheep, allowing the great powers to devour it with their claws and teeth. Then, will we forever be willing to be in the position of sheep without thinking of revitalizing ourselves? This is not the case. Mr. Wu told us, "It is certainly not easy for China to pretend to be a tiger or a lion, but at least it should learn from a dog." What are the benefits of learning from a dog? Although a dog is not as good as a tiger or a lion, it is much stronger than a sheep. Sheep can only be slaughtered by others. When a dog is trampled on, it will bark, fight back, and may even bite you fiercely. As Mr. Wu said, "When you want to beat a dog to death, you have to make a considerable sacrifice." In fact, although being a sheep is shameful, learning from a dog is not necessarily glorious. But we understand that Mr. Wu said this with his own unavoidable difficulties. Our country has been repeatedly invaded in recent years, without any spirit of resistance. If this continues, China will only gradually perish, without any hope of emerging. Therefore, he believes that rather than being a pair of sheep, docilely controlled by others, it is better to learn from a dog. When someone comes to beat us, we can fight them to the death. This is what a dog is worth learning from. The other day, the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini encouraged the people of the whole country with the saying, "Better to live for one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep." Today, it is impossible for our country to pretend to be a tiger or a lion, and being a sheep is not what we want. Then, let's learn from a dog. Autumn Harvest Xin Ye A few days of wind and rain had already made the people of Gongjia Fort worried day and night. In several fields, people were coming and going like patrols. Almost every face was covered with a layer of frost; in that withered and yellow complexion, there was a thick sense of melancholy; under those large bamboo hats and tattered raincoats, their hunger and cold could no longer be concealed. But looking at the sky, the sky was as ugly as their faces: it was covered with such an annoying dark cloud, and the rain was like the tears of a young widow whose husband had just died, flowing endlessly. The wind directly shook the treetops in the air, and the wind and rain fell together on the rice that had just formed a hull of grain, causing them all to fall into the mud like rolling dragons. "Hey! A bowl of rice has already been brought to my mouth, and you still want to knock it away. Are our lives really so bad?" Sister-in-law Si was twisting straw ropes in the hall. Occasionally, she looked up at the outside of the door. The wind and rain were still blowing and drifting endlessly: she couldn't help but angrily gather a bunch of straw ropes, "What's the use of twisting these life-threatening ropes? Anyway, I'm just preparing to tie up a few bundles of rotten straw to pad the pigsty in the future."</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>Brother Si walked in weakly from the back door, glanced at his wife, he didn't even take off his clothes, threw the bamboo hat on his head to the ground, and sat down on the threshold. In this way, the two of them stayed like this for a long time, focusing their sight on the ground, and occasionally the four lines of sight met, but they were just conveying each other's sorrows. For dinner, they still had a coarse silk pumpkin, and they added more water when cooking it, so they could barely have three bowls per person. "I was hoping that after we harvested the rice and turned the mill, we could eat a few meals of new rice; this damn pumpkin has been eaten for half a year, it's really too boring..." Every time Sister-in-law Si thought of the fragrant white rice, she would always swallow a few mouthfuls of saliva. When she saw the golden rice flowers in her own field a few days earlier, she said with a cracked mouth, "We can have rice to eat!" But the continuous autumn wind and autumn rain in recent days almost shattered her rice-eating dream. "People should not be dissatisfied," Brother Si had already finished a large bowl of pumpkin, even with the skin and soup, and then put the empty bowl heavily on the table, and then picked up another bowl and said, "Don't you see, the second and third brothers have already eaten up all the pumpkins!" "They are also really pitiful, and they have so many children!" The sky cleared, and the sun had already raised its head from the east very charmingly, and everyone in Gongjia Fort seemed to see a dying patient suddenly turn for the better and rejoiced. In a few days, the rice stalks in the fields all turned golden, and the ears of rice were so heavy that they lowered their heads. If you took an ear of rice to weigh, I believe it would weigh at least four taels, so this joy almost made every farmer in Gongjia Fort jump up. The adults were thinking, "We can always eat new rice for a few days." The children were thinking, "We can also ask our parents to make a few sheng of rice cakes." For several days, everyone in the village was busy harvesting, so the children in the family were allowed to wander around inside and outside the village, and no one went to restrain them. Even a few dogs were running around with their tails between their legs. On the open space in front of each house, there were piles and piles of rice. The men and women in the fields were all bending over to tie up bundles and bundles of rice. On the roads and ridges were all the people carrying rice. Everyone greeted each other when they met, each taking on their own work, but it could be seen that there was a kind of joy on their faces that had not been revealed for a long time. From harvesting, gleaning rice, transporting grain, turning the mill, to milling rice, the people in the whole village worked hard for half a month. They forgot their fatigue, forgot their hunger, and worked excitedly, but by the time they paid the rent and taxes, they only had some broken rice left. But the debts they borrowed and the rice they ate were still impossible to repay! "This autumn harvest, other places are suffering from floods or droughts, but Gongjia Fort has an unexpected good harvest." Many locals all said this enviously. "Alas! What counts as a good harvest? I have worked hard for half a year and hoped for half a year, but I didn't expect to not even eat rice husks. Half a year of sweat and blood, a season of great hope, only got these broken rice!" The people of Gongjia Fort said with a sigh. Everyone had the same mournful faces; you looked at me, I looked at you, there was no certainty about the days ahead, and the future fate was also unpredictable... Mountain Residence Miscellany Meng Hua One more annoying thing about rainy days is that in this mountain village, there is no way to receive letters and news, and it also prevents friends from visiting. It confines me in this small house, it expands the space. At night, I sit by the clear oil lamp. Fireflies fly back and forth in the small room. The barking of wild dogs and the rustling sound of raindrops falling on the leaves outside the house make me shiver even more, and the erratic mountain wind, which I don't know where it blows from or where it blows to, roars angrily like a primitive war. So I feel that I am really too small, too weak, and I deeply understand the concept of gods of the early people in primitive times. I lay on the bed extremely bored, as if imprisoned in a dark dungeon, or trapped in the heavy siege of thousands of troops and horses. "In the same country, one place is suffering from drought, and thousands of people are starving to death, while we are in the siege of incessant rain. When will the day come when mankind conquers nature?" I thought like this, and I thought this was not impossible. (2) Red Leaves On the opposite side of my house, there is a high, stone-built wall, and several clusters of ivy are densely entwined on the wall, covering the entire wall. It is autumn, in the evening. I sit alone in the house, and I can't hear any sound, only the mountain wind掠過 the top of the wall, teasing the leaves of the ivy. The leaves tremble in the wind, making a rustling sound, also like the trembling of an old man. The leaves falling from the branches roll down from above, gently knocking on the windows with the wind, and quietly吐着 some unknown complaints. The remaining leaves that are brought to the corner of the wall also keep rolling in the wind. The desolate sound is like the sigh of a dying person in the erratic evening wind. At this time, the heart of a lonely mountain dweller, especially a sick person, is as heavy as lead. The leaves of the ivy have turned from green to yellow in this season, and some have turned from yellow to vermilion. It is as red as maple leaves, as red as blood. It knows that its end is coming, so it condenses all the remaining energy on this, turning it into a red, gorgeous color. But autumn is gradually deepening. During the day, there is wind blowing, and at night, there is frost invading. It finally falls from the branches, and is decadently rolled in the pile of敗時 in the corner of the wall. Red leaves, I control it. It is not afraid of severe frost. The more it is frozen, the more moving it is. Red leaves are beautiful. The afterglow of the setting sun is also beautiful, but the twilight follows, what does this symbolize? Bathing in Port Dickson Da From the lush green of Longfu to Port Dickson, the car takes one hour and fifteen minutes to arrive. Along the way, we pass through two small hills: one is Wanmao; the other is Lugub. Looking from the car, it is like riding a horse and looking at flowers, but the distant mountains are like eyebrows, and the green forests are quiet. The scenery is beautiful, and even in a hurry, it can still be vaguely appreciated. The town of Port Dickson is not very big. The whole slope has only one not very neat street and a few streets. The shops on the street are mostly very low and simple. In addition, the tall, towering trees on both sides of the street make the light in the shop feel dark and dull during the day. The businesses here, except for a very few that were created by Jinings, are all operated by our compatriots. The government and public buildings, as well as the hospitals, are mostly close to the railway, and Xingyu is large in scale. Every day, trains run from here, so although the town is not very prosperous in business, it is a bit famous. The car stopped abruptly at the pier. What unfolded in front of us was a piece of sea that connected to the sky, as blue as sapphires, as smooth as a mirror and shining brightly. Two or three white sails were leisurely soaring on the sea, rising and falling, missing the yellow setting sun. At the end of the sea and sky, there were a few sails and a wisp of smoke from the chimneys of small steamers that were floating on the water. "Oh, what a beautiful and poetic sea!" I exclaimed in surprise. I suddenly felt my chest widen, and the depression of the past few years dissipated into a wisp of light smoke. We stepped onto the Highland Villa, which was built on a hill by the sea. The scenery is excellent, and the construction is also great. Below is a magnificent and majestic Japanese-style building, which was originally owned by the famous Mr. Wang Zude of Gulong, but strangely, no one lives inside. There is only an "old woman" (female servants) guarding the house. It is said that the owner comes here every week with his concubine and daughters to escape the heat, but they never spend the night here. We walked into the swimming pool by the sea, put on our swimming suits, crossed the stone bridge, and jumped into the clear sea with a "plop". When we were tired of swimming, we got out of the water, sat on the flower-covered beach, and listened quietly to the gentle sound of the seawater kissing the sandy beach. Sometimes, we lowered our heads and stared blankly at the footprints left on the wet sand, picked up and played with the shiny shells, or watched the small steamers glide through the calm and smooth sea, as light as a pair of seagulls掠過 the water. Until the sun set, the evening tide rose high, and the beach whistled with bursts of faint cries. This beautiful, gentle, and lovely sea! Lonely Star Qi Le Jian The surrounding bare mountains are鹅黄色的, and the hydrangeas in the small mountain village are too鲜艳了. The strong colors make the scenery into a picture of "Autumn light first arrives at the wild people's home." Walking out of a dilapidated alley, the mountain scenery is suddenly open, with some lingering grievances in my heart: but, this is the old place. From under the tree by the road, such a sound suddenly came: "Sir, do you want a donkey from the market?" The words were spoken with a十足異的 country accent. "Ma qiang is no longer needed." He carefully looked me up and down, maybe暗地裏 laughing at me for being a stranger. He frequently used the willow branch in his hand to drive away mosquitoes for the donkey, as if to tell me that he was experienced in driving the journey. "Without ma qiang, what do you need a donkey for!" "Sir, don't you know, those bandits have long been wiped out!" The young man said stubbornly, "Even the people in the market town saw that it was about to become ruins. They couldn't even get half a hundred cattle in the cattle market, so they gathered enough bird guns, axes, knives and all kinds of sharp weapons in the market town, and finally cleaned up a few leaders. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any donkeys!" In this way, I deeply felt that I could no longer be considered a stranger. I got on his donkey, let the young man hold the donkey rope, and led the way. I conveniently broke off a willow branch to cover the scorching sun. I still vaguely remember, looking up from the foot of Lonely Star Qi, the梢 end of the long yew forest was正在着 the brightest constellation. In the night, the surroundings were阴森而料峭, and from afar, I could see the cooking smoke in the forest, which was exactly the time when the green forest heroes were enjoying themselves. I had crossed this area under the donkey夫's trick. At that time, I was leaving the market town and moving to the small mountain village with my parents. Talking to the young man along the way, I learned that a few new inns had opened in Lonely Star Qi. I was a little frightened about this crowded place for travelers to rest. In the novels of the past, mountain shops性往带有着 the horror of "black shops" that kill people and steal goods. Afterwards, I consoled myself that a young man like me didn't need to be frightened. If I couldn't make it to the market today, I would have to spend the night there. I realized that I was like a character in an old novel. The donkey arrived at Lonely Star Qi. The scorching sun in the wilderness had not收敛 its light, and it was just right to catch up with the market. The most fearful thing was that the oranges had been pulled out. I really stayed at an inn. In the small厢房, the was simple and old-fashioned. All the were dirty and black. A circle of mosquito coils could not驱那尘多蚊子, but a large pile of灯蛾 was burned to death on the 洋烛台. Outside the window was a黄泥的广场, with two cattle pens built,栓住了好些性口, and the smell of牛溲马勃荡散 was scattered all around the inn. I arranged the帐子 properly, told the waiter not to stir up wine and cook food, and ran out of the inn by myself. That night, the mountain間 of Lonely Star Qi was正在挂着 a light moon, and a淡飘逸的情调 caught羁旋 a 客心. I never expected to消受这么一个升平的月夜 in清寂 the mountains!
