<h3 id="c19">英內閣之改組 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>成立至今迅將四年之英國國民內閣。已於本月七日實行改組。此種政局之變化。早在世人意料之中。要不足奇。蓋近年來國會中保守黨常佔絕大多數。麥唐納一派之所謂國民工黨。勢力微不足道。在前麥氏之所以得任首揆者。不過保守黨欲假為一時之傀儡耳。至於事實上之首相。實為包爾溫而非麥唐納。故今次內閣之改組。本一時間問題。且自去冬以來。各方不滿麥唐納之情緖。大有一致露骨表演之勢。在反政府之工黨方面。以麥氏有出賣工黨之罪。恨之深入骨髓。同時由工黨視之。英國一九三一年秋之經濟恐慌。今已不復存在。國民內閣。更無繼續之必要。而麥氏仍以維護國民內閣為言。似乎跡近維護個人之祿位。故工黨對於麥氏攻擊益烈。自由黨方面之反現政府者。其所見亦復相同。至去冬英國各地市選。工黨又頗見勝利。可見民情趨向。亦在政黨政治之復活。不在國民內閣之維護也。此種事實之發展。足使麥氏威望失墜。殊為顯然。及至本年正月二十八日英國國會開會時。竟有人大駡麥氏為騙子。為猪仔。為一無能下賤之狗。應卽出政界。後十日麥氏於某處演說。力言其有維護國民內閣之必要。聽者莫不學為貓呌以報之。此種公然侮辱挪揄之態度。果出於工黨之所為。抑出於保守黨之敎唆。雖不得而知。然麥氏之為人討厭。實已不能掩飾矣。近日麥氏引退之消息。傳之者屢。識者固早知其行將知難而退也。</p>
<p>今者英內閣已改組完畢。包爾溫不僅為事實上之首揆。同時更名符其實矣。包氏於其施政方針中。雖仍以維護國民內閣為立塲。而同時以四閣席予國民工黨。二席予國民自由黨。其作用似在覊糜此等人物。以孤國會中反對黨之勢。至事實上則國民內閣之勢力。已大見削弱。故此一內閣。謂為趨同政黨內閣之一種過渡。實無不可。今後英國之內政外交或仍不免有多少鉍化。但其變動。當不至甚烈。蓋麥膺納時代。英國之內政外交。本已採取保守黨政策。如失業津貼之减少。公務人員薪給之削减。保護關稅之採取。海空各軍之擴充。無不與工黨自由黨之傳統政策相背謬。故以勢推之。今後之英國。至多於此數者。略加增益推動之功。必不致取前內閣之一切而改絃史張也。</p>
<p>唯外交方面。英國態度。或將稍趨明顯。亦未可知。今次外相之易人卽其開端。在麥膺納時代。當外交之衝要者。如非西門。即爲麥氏自己。西門為自由黨。麥氏為工黨。兩人外交見解。自然較為接近。就各黨對外政策而言。工黨與自由黨比較的消極與和平。保守黨則比較的積極。今外相一席。旣已易為保守黨之郝爾。自難免有多少變化。於此可注意者有二一為對德問題。二為遠東問題。包爾溫嘗謂英國之防綫。今已不在杜佛。而在萊茵。包氏發表此言之後。英國之海空軍。始分別擴充。同時英法意之恊調。亦於以促成。包爾溫對德之戒懼。於此可見。再則保守黨中。反德者多。如邱吉爾。吉伯林。皮佛勃洛克等人。皆其著者。故英國此後之對德防虞。能否消釋。實為問題。至於遠東方面。包爾溫於不久以前。卽謂英美兩國茍能合作。則世界任何一隅之和平。卽不難維持。是包氏固有意於英美之合作者也。據昨日美　。華盛頓方面之觀察。亦復如是。設包氏之言。確乎言之由衷。則此後英國之外交。當有重要之發展也。</p>

<p>京漢特別班　恐難成事實</p>
<p>招商局長江上游、自峨嵋輪失事後、用河方面至今尙未派輪復航、坐棄航業、損失至巨、劉鴻生總經理為此特提議建造上游新式快輪、準備發展上江航綫、其造船費用、擬用中英庚款餘額、購買材料、由滬上各船廠承造、此事已擬具辦法、並招標承建、同時局內籌議發展上江航營監事會、營業部且派員赴上游調查、茲將詳情、分述如下、</p>
<p>入川視察　監事會總稽核李雲良、與營務科之分局設王濟賢、為考察揚子江上游之航業狀況、特以視察名義、由滬赴漢、再轉往沙市宜昌萬縣及重慶各埠、此去以考查上江之全部航業、預為本局統盤籌劃之發展航業地步、而謀恢復川河航綫，</p>
<p>添建三輪　長江上游、局丙現祇快利一輪、其他亦僅租船兩艘，故添建上江柴油快輪、實為業務上之先急問題、劉鴻生已經擬定就中英庚欵餘額內、提用若干、為建造三輪之資、各船長約三百英尺、吃水約八英尺、載重五百噸、速率每小時行十四海浬、燃料用柴油引擎、省費而速快、船內客位、布置優美、其材料向英購買、然後由上海船塢承造、</p>
<p>投標情形　此三輪投標承建當時由江南船廠與大中華機器廠等投得承造三船之標開標時、以大中華造價較廉、每船以長三百英尺計算、需徉廿萬九千元、但大中華船廠、在開價之後、又復函局、聲明須增加船身長度、方能適合一切、而造價上每艘須在二十二萬元以上、局內對此、因其較江南廠價並不廉賤、故尙在計議、一俟决定、再行交造、</p>
<p>京漢快輪　本埠馬爾康洋行之錢君、條陳蔣委員長、請以中英庚欵、借出一百四十萬元、特造速快江輪兩艘、專航京漢一路、南京至漢、向須兩日夜到達者、此特快輪落成後、每天早晨開、夜中十二時即可到漢、早發夕到、定可獲利、蔣委員長特將此案發交二部令招商局議復、局內對於此案、已經復部、謂上年鄂建廳卽請以峨嵋輪開京漢速快班、，將京漢三百八十八海浬航程、縮至十六小時行到、則行駛之輪、每小時須開二十四海浬、非此則不及、如果行二十四海浬之快輪、若以燃煤計、尋常船每小時燒煤一噸者、此速快輪須燒九噸、僅此一項、增出八倍之媒價、營業有虧無餘、此其一、長江內如行此快輪、天天如驅逐艦一般之飛駛、不特船身危險、恐兩邊江岸、亦將冲盪激壞、關係更巨、有百害而無一利者也云云、</p>

<p>— 良</p>
<p>國人懷抱迷信外商之心理久矣、即就金融方面而言、一般國人之目光、莫不視洋商銀行最為可　、而對本國銀行、每多忽視、甚至有存心講議者、昂其理由、則曰、外人信用卓著、洋商銀行資金充實可靠、數十年來、國人此種心理、殆已根深蒂固、不易變更、</p>
<p>外商銀行之信用究何如乎、試就歷年事實、略加體察、十餘年來、外商銀行之倒閉停業者、已有多家、（一）上海廣興銀行、為美商所辦、創　於一九一九年、旋以營業不振兼受東方大行家營業失敗之影響、虧折甚鉅、一九二二年經紐約董事會議決收歇清理、（二）支華銀行、創於一九一八年、為美國保險信託公司商業銀行舊金山國立銀行芝加哥大陸銀行等所組織、因生金買賣、突遭損失、於一九二四年、遂告結束、（三）大東銀行、係中日合辦性質、民國十六年時局變化、存戶提欵者甚湧、各關係銀行、謝絕援助、無法應付、乃宣布停業、（四）中法實業銀行、創於民國元年、總行設於巴黎、分行設於吾國境內者、上海北平天津漢口雲南廣州汕頭奉天等處、在華有發行權、因營業不慎、於民國十年下半期結賬時、突告停業、（五）華俄道勝銀行、成立之初、因俄政府為後盾、及至日俄之戰、俄敗於日、其營業大受打擊、在中國境內之分支行、均遭停頓、（六）中華匯業銀行、係中日合辦、上海為分行之一、十七年冬、因平津擠兌提存、益以國際政治關係、遂於是年冬休業、（七）中華懋業銀行、為中美合辦、總行在北京、上海為分行之一、後因營業不振、即行倒閉、最近則美商美豐銀行又猝然宣告停業、以上諸銀行或為外人所辦、或係中外合辦性質、均不免於倒閉、可知銀行組織不分中外、惟信用卓著者、始能深入人心也、</p>
<p>美豐銀行創業已有二十年之歷史、資本美金五十五萬元國幣一百二十五萬元、公積金國幣二百餘萬元、資產負債總額約二千萬元、在外商銀行中、堪稱中上銀行、而國人亦信之彌篤、該行存欵一九三二年計一千零三十三萬餘元、最近報載八九百萬元、存戶佔四十國籍、俄僑與美僑最多、但據吾人推算、國人之存欵該行者為數必甚巨也、</p>
<p>外籍銀行利用不平等條約上領事裁判權之優勢、不受我國法令限制、其倒閉者、每多以不了了之、十足清理者、殊不多見、最佳者亦不過以無利債券長期拔付已耳、國人受此重創、幾如啞子吃黃連、有苦說不盡、反而言之、即使外籍銀行果屬充實可靠、若　亦不過充分利用國人之存欵、以作種種投機事業、美豐受其本國白銀政策之賜、致蒙地價慘落、外匯民暴跌美國股票投機影響、存底枯薄、遂成僵局、是則其業務之危殆可知矣、國人不計及此、一味迷信、誠可慨也、</p>
<p>國人今後應由外籍銀行美豐之停閉、而憬然覺悟、從根本打破迷信外人心理、著眼於本國銀行、深致信用、古語有云、亡羊補牢、未為晚也、吾人秉此精神、改變心理、實猶未遲、就事實言、本國銀行亦多內容充實、信用卓著、其稍遜者不過三數家非同業公會會員之小銀行耳、至於發行兌換券、就其準備金而論、吾國銀行以六成現金四成證券、或有超過六成現金者、外國銀行採用準備金比例、有二一制者、有三一制者或四成制者、比例雖各有不同、要皆不若我國所定之高、當無疑矣、</p>
<p>尤有進者、年業政府當局對金融之調劑與改進、不遺餘力、市面雖不景氣、但前途頗多新興之象、總之、吾人之目光、應以事實為依歸、為個人計為民族計、均非信賴華商銀行不可、</p>

<p>提起金錢來，誰都要去咀咒它，尤其是我們這班窮朋友，但是牠是個無知的蠢物，萬惡與萬能，全是由入類愚弄而造成的；假使我們有了滿足的金錢時，也就忘其所以，會以金錢去支配弱小者了！</p>
<h3 id="c175">濟南歸客談 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 秋娘</p>
<p>同事馬君自濟南歸，為述該地近况，誌之如次：</p>
<p>濟南為山東省府所在地，所有公務人員，在韓復築主席指尋之下，出入均須黑色制服制帽。最近每在星期一必舉行週會一次，地點在濟南城外大操塲，離城約七八華里光景，時間定在上午五時。由城來者，且不許車馬代步，韓主席亦以身作則，約莫四時許，卽步行前往，五時正卽親自點名，無敢缺席者。間有遲到數分鐘者，當由總部送回各該原籍縣政府代為看管，聽候處分。</p>
<p>服務省府者除有隨身眷屬者可以自由在外賃屋居住外，其餘單身漢子，一律件宿公寓。聞省府公寓甚大，而廁所僅有一所，且距離公寓甚遠，在隆冬天寒地凍時節，卽一大小便，亦多跋踄之苦，於是有人採用便壺政策，以濟其窮，事為韓主席察覺，竟以「貪懶」二字，科以罰薪一月之處分，自此便壼政策此路不通以後，又有人提倡以痰盂代替便帝者，結果亦均査覺被罰。</p>
<p>濟南市所有公務人員之服務，完全採國貨粗布，非常樸素。聞有某公務人員足穿織貢呢鞋上班，為韓主席所遇見，韓主席卽向之舉手為禮，當時某公務人員手足無措，未知如何是可，韓謂：「我非對你敬禮，我是對你漂亮的鞋子敬禮」，某公務人員卽將鞋子當場脫去，可憐一對襪子，竟變作犧牲品矣。</p>
<p>濟南暮春天氣，仍多寒冷，故御笨重棉衣褲者仍大有人在，較之大江南北，穿夾衣猶嫌微熱者，相去懸殊矣。</p>

<p>從喝酒也可以看出各人的性情來。人在平常的時候，總不免有些矜從持。這矜持就是要想保全做人的面子的，故態度總不大自然。假使三杯黃酒落肚，不覺說話也會無顧忌了，舉動也不會無拘束了：所以觀人，應在喝酒時觀</p>
<p>身上穿了一套粗布衣服，腳上套了一雙蒲鞋，立在酒店門首，挖出幾個銅子，換了一杯白乾一喝而盡，把手向鼻口一掩，不忍使酒氣絲毫外洩的這種朋友，是難得喝酒的；所以他異常珍惜。他喝酒的目的，並不是陶情，是想解解寒氣，或者興奮一下，再可為人作牛馬走。</p>
<p>三朋四友，踱進酒館，未喝酒，先點菜。猜起拳來，面紅筋赤，聲震四座；而且彼此各不相讓，彷彿有深仇宿恨似的。一不小心，酒壼潑翻，亦不甚惜，再來一下。這種朋友是不會喝酒的。倘使數十年陳酒也是這樣喝法，旁觀者眞要替那名酒痛惜了。像這樣喝酒的人，大概是喜動不喜靜的。</p>
<p>一二知己，對據一桌。菜不在佳，好酒是飲，淺斟低酌，娓娓淸談；喝到適可而止，不再添酒了。這種朋友是眞會喝酒的；他們的性情是難得糊塗的，或者是火氣已經脫盡的。</p>
<p>至於酒後發瘋有的喜歡軟勸，有的喜歡硬勸；從這，也可以看出人的性情來。</p>

<p>你說，這如何是好？自然，不能說為了洋貨的運入，閉塞交通，但是交通陽利到汁麽地方，洋貨就暢銷到什麽地方，這似乎也不能聽其自然，總當想個法子來防備了。要不然，好像公路全是為外商謀便利的。周有容笑道：這話誠然不錯，但是這有什麽法子呢？除非建築起關稅的壁壘，把進口的洋貨，重重的征收起來。可是中國對洋貨加稅，似乎不能十分自由吧？說畢，他也跟着歎了一口氣。在這樣一偏頭的時間，就看到了桌上放了一隻瓦駱駝，因笑道：你程先生也喜歡這個？志前道：那裏是我喜歡，人家勉强放在這裏的，於是將剛才的重說了一遍。有容笑道：你這屋子裏熱鬧，一會兒是國家大事，一會兒又是男女私情。我還忘了問呢，那姑娘的事怎麽樣子？志前微笑道：說起來好笑，我那位，補課的學生，他大大的誤會，以為我對那姑娘有了什麽意思，對我很帶了醋意，其實我縱然不才，何至乘人於危，對這個逃難的姑娘，要下什麽毒手？可是我那學生很不諒解，生着氣就這樣走了。我看那樣子，氣頭子遠是不小。有容笑道：這件事，本來也就太可以令人疑心。那姑娘將衣服脫得乾凈，居然在你床上睡着。你也並不是五十歲六十歲的人，對這姑娘特別的殷勤，他怎地不疑心？（二三六）</p>

<p>記着！我們大家今天必須十二分的小心」。八個人互相勸戒道：「無論如何，不要有一些觸怒太后；只要我們能時常露着笑容，恭敬奉命，那末今天這一日必然可以始終快活的了，也許伊老人家的這一副笑臉，因此更能多多的延長幾天」。</p>
<p>這些話自然是人人所樂從的，便各自小心翼翼的回到了指定的執事上去。</p>
<p>昆明湖是頤和園內有名的勝景，雖然是人工所鑿就的，但面積倒也很寬闊，儘够讓太后駕着伊的遊艇，在它上面往來浮遊了。關於太后的遊艇，作者已在第十三章裏提起過了；但我們為保存宮中的舊制起見，不妨依舊稱之為「御舟」。御舟也是不常在昆明湖上出現的，理由是太后事竟不能像紅樓夢中的賈母一般的富於閒暇，祇有晚春以後和初秋以前的一個時期裏，才能稍稍領略一些遊湖之樂：所以今天的出遊，委實可算是一件偶爾希逢的勝事。</p>
<p>那「御舟」的式樣是很普通的，只是一艘有篷的大船，同樣以櫓相竹篙為行船的工具；中部照例也有一間房艙，只是建造得特別的高大，而且彫鏤玲瓏，朱漆輝煌，有着和岸上那些宮殿相似的華麗。所以我稱它為「湖上浮宮是一些不錯的！（三三六）</p>

<p>錫山之陽，有泉曰白沙，邑志載：大旱不涸，灌田數千畝。其下有巨浸，水更黝碧而深，即土人稱為東大池者。幽閟邃藏，游屐所不至焉。本月星期，余自宜興兩洞歸，過梅園，御人舉以吿，遂一涉其間。池離車道，凡二里强，可徒步達；驟視之，若弗甚奇，窮討有間，萬能一生也。循池東崖行，過桃源」，古松一一化龍虬作攫人狀；望隔岸濃陰蒙落日，漏微陽如金綫，如綠髮；入池，魚波掀之，更時時幻作水花，飛上樹頭與襟間；亦有暮鴉呼噪甚急，此景畫圖聖手所弗任描也。其北，惠山陣之，淵穆肅峙，宛然一大圍屛。陀延而西，蔚為豐林，修亙各三數里，東池如半環綠墳玦，淸氣鬱溢，松脂與筠粉相間也。巡迴一周，開　幽期，莫不極盡其致。方塘半鑑，而備羅如此，可異也已！</p>

<p>— 麗芳</p>
<p>淸和的四月，天氣不寒不暖，那眞是游覽的季節呵，這大，我和綠，埜一舸烟水，泛棹苕溪，本是想往雲巢去的，那知北風吹得很緊，船夫沒力一天把船就撑到雲巢，欵乃聲中，不知不覺巳是月上黃昏時候，我們便在荻港泊岸過宿了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，順便上岸走走，綠埜便引我走進了南苕勝境。</p>
<p>這裏，不是梵王宮殿，也不是羽士的棲眞之所，却是一所俗家人主持而供奉呂祖的乩壇，他們雖像神道設敎一般，但，也有些像文人學子聚在一起修身養性的塲合。據那植立在裏面的碑記上說：這所在叫雲怡堂，創始在速在淸代乾嘉時間，他們所做的事業都在慈善方面，如放生，惜字，施醫，捨藥，義塾，以及近乎神權時代的延生度死等等，那南苕勝境，便是門前牆上沒曾遭逢紅羊刦火的四個大字。這裏，曾經傳說下來，有一個故事，據綠埜告訴我，是這樣的：</p>
<p>那時，紅羊事起，這雲怡堂上的弟子們，都往叩問呂祖，而乩筆判將下來，却說「南苕勝境無恙，於是荻港人遂都避居此間，不料盡遭火　，亂平，只剩南苕勝境四字，其它的樓台亭閣，則一概付諸一炬了。　　那許是扶乩朋友的妙手筆哩，這些，且莫冉提。</p>
<p>我們是游覽來的，那采風問俗的勾當，自然不得撇過一傍。我們祇覺得南苕勝境，才眞是南苕勝境吧。</p>
<p>那兒進了鬥，就有一院的花木，中間是于個大漁池，池面上橫跨着一條似長虹般的石橋，四周又是整齊的石欄，池裏面蓄了幾十尾金色的鯉魚，憑欄下怪，頗有濠上之樂，這風致不下於湖上的玉泉。兩傍都是，排敞軒，有頌酒齋·桐陰小憇·等幾憫院落，如果有機會在此四時讀書，那眞有令人興着讀書之樂樂如何的感想哩。</p>
<p>雲怡堂是臨池建築的，從這裏進去，都是曲折迥廊，頗有引人入勝模樣。在後園裏，尤多亂疊的假山，一面古木參天，一面名花雜蒔，迴廊盡處，則有四面廳一所，也很有園林風味，可惜似乎已好久不曾修理，所以車長沒脛了，。</p>
<p>這裏也很多名人字跡，如粱山舟朱石君彭玉麟等，都有手澤，一切院落的題名之雅，別處史不多見，像梁山舟書的玩樂箴，供奉魁星的地方，題名讀書處，那眞是匠心獨連，妙手得之咧。</p>
<p>匆匆間瀏覽了一回，又順走在這小鎭上四處走走，只見一灣流水，把這小市鎭繞在中間，幽街僻巷，靜悄悄地沒個人來往，使我們塵俗中人，到此胸襟為之一爽，這小市鎭，也何嘗不是南苕勝境阿！</p>

<p>— 甘洪濤</p>
<p>火柴為輕便工業之一種，人民生活所必需，在工業中佔一重要位置。數年以前，外貨火柴，充塞市塲，卒以國內火柴商努力經營，設法改進，使在中國市塲上頗有活動勢力之火柴外商，一網打盡，試觀市面上瑞典火柴鳳凰牌之不見踪跡，已可概見。最近國內火柴業，亦以商業不振，市面蕭索，倒閉淸理，相繼而起，非設法救濟，將成不可收拾之勢。然一考其失敗由來，則為銷路呆滯，存貨不動，咎在生產過剩，供給太多耳。同時外貨火柴。又現活動之勢，偷運入境，漏課賦稅，得以低價暢銷，因之國貨大受打擊。此外火柴統稅，較二三年前高出一倍有餘，成本已高，統銳加大，售價不能隨之增加，虧蝕之來，不外如此而已。為今之計，火柴需要既有一定數目，維持價格於不落，惟有設法限制生產。先調查全國每年所需火柴多少，國外可銷多少，再統計全國火柴廠每年能出產多少，兩相比較，得一結數，乃使多出產之數景，按全國火柴廠生產量之大小。比例分配减少，則各廠產數，得無過剩之虞，全國產數適抵銷數。供求得以相應，價格亦可維持平衡。至於外貨輸入及鬨內外商，另當設法使其在國內無立足之地，外貨輸入，政府須極力加以限制，徵以進口重稅，關卡各口，嚴査偷進，使其在中國境內銷售時，價格不能較國貨為低；如自行賤售，結果亦非損失不可。在國內外商，其製造均轉機器，成本較輕，政府徵稅，規定較華商為高，使其售價不得减低。際此火柴業危急存亡之秋，火柴統稅，最好暫時减低，如事實上未能辦到，則設法暫為記　，不繳現金，俟營業復有起色後，按期拔違，如是商人方面，現金較可流轉，减輕負擔，政府以後仍可收稅，兩得其便，否則商人不堪維持，勢必失敗。在商人方面，應互相聯合，不可傾軋，如舉辦聯合營業等，價格可規定一律，違者處罰，同時再與烟紙店商聯絡，請其拒受外貨，火柴銷去後，給以相當佣金，則烟紙店商必願合作也。</p>
<p>編者按，火柴業確為足堪抵制洋貨之事業，自不忍見其失敗，故為披露之。但立於不敗之地者，仍其在品質之優良，深望火柴業對其出品能加之意焉。</p>

<h3 id="c225">小品文的題材 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>對於「題材」的剪取一，詩歌不妨凭主觀，小說和劇本是要注重客觀　條伴的。詩歌，形式上是非文法」的，只要表得出大意，吟咏得順口，缺少動詞，省略主語，都不要緊，反正不怕讀者的發生誤會，實質上是「非理知」的，要格外的富於情感。所謂凭主觀，就是採用的題材，無非由於同時感觸着，不問對象中各項事物之間的關係怎麽樣。譬如，在一首裏面，上一段寫着王女士的活潑，下一段忽然寫起孫姑娘的天眞來：或者前面寫孫姑娘的哀愁，後面忽然寫起王女士的苦惱來。王女士同孫姑娘，有沒有關係，關係怎麽樣，都是不成問題的：把她們並寫在一起，只是因為作者同時威想到，覺得都可愛或者可憐罷了。所以在詩歌里面，往往東說一句月亮，西說一句什麽花或者什麽鳥；剛在描寫狂風大雨的可怕，忽然提起革命的勇猛激烈來。拉雜凑合，是無所謂時間觀念，不管地方關係的。</p>
<p>小說扣劇本可不能够這樣，所寫的事實，一定要是相互勾連得很緊的，才可以並列在一起所謂客觀的，原要表明對象中各項事物之間的關係，所以對於「故事」發生的時間和地點，都要整理淸　　的題材，不一定要是形成整個的故事的。</p>
<p>小品文的剪取題材，正介在這兩者之間，就是一方面可以憑主觀，同時也得顧到客觀的條伴。小品文中所寫的事實，也是要像小說和劇本中的互有關係，前後聯絡的。可是比較來得寬容；小說和劇本因為要有一定的「作意」，須從　結構」上定出「焦點」來，所寫的各項事物，固然要相互　連，前後一致。而且相互關連前後一致的事實，未必可以採用：為謀緊張，還得看是否合於作意和結構。小品文無須從結構定出焦點來，在一篇之中，也不限於表明一種意見，只要事實是相互關聯的就得，不妨依照意願隨彎倒彎的寫去。</p>

<p>— 姚慕</p>
<p>—風塵小札之一—</p>
<p>朋友：</p>
<p>突然，我從白日夢裏醒過來了。</p>
<p>白日夢—因為我在夢裏意識到牠是夢，而且牠的破滅也是在我的預期之中。但是，牠那樣的短促，並且以噩夢的姿態收塲，却不大楚我意想得到的吧。</p>
<p>夢的破滅，我沒有懊悔；曰日夢目不是甜蜜的。所恨的只是牠的短促—短促到差不多像幻覺那樣。向噩夢的轉變，我沒有驚悸，只有驚喜，在平凡到使人膩煩的現實世界裏，帶有怪險性質的，縱然是夢，也是一種愉快，這神夢的哲學，聰明的朋友，你理會釗麽？</p>
<p>前不多時，你不是以驚訝的筆調寫信來問我在做着甚麽夢嗎？朋友，恕我，至今我還不能够吿訴你。不是因為我在醒後巳把牠忘記到一乾　凈，而是因為這　夢像謎一樣，說破了就沒一點味兒，至多我只能把謎面說給你聽。</p>
<p>在這夢裏，我還是　，而又不是我。</p>
<p>在這夢裏，我做着我平生所厭惡，痛恨的事情，我說着寫着，當世歌賢的話—我不高興而又不配說和寫的話。像孤島一樣，我跟我的舊的理想的大驗隔絕，在這四周的人海中，臉孔，說詁的態度，以至稱呼，名詞，於我都是陌生的，—像別的世界那樣的陌生。但是我要做那沐而冠的猴戲，我要做會叫「客來，倒茶」的鸚鵡。在夢裏，一些的朋友們的詛咒，同時却領略到一些不相干人的奉承羨慕以至嫉妒，但是，對於這一切，無論是詛咒或是嫉妒，我只有微笑。在這夢裏　，我沒有厭惡自已，我只嘲笑我的周遭，因為這周遭，我不是我，而我還同時是我。</p>
<p>朋友，你或者會拿弗羅乙德的夢的心理分析來應用一下吧？假如眞是這樣，你便錯了。恰與弗羅乙德的夢的哲學相反，敎我在夢裏這樣做的不是弗羅乙德所說的一下意識一，而正是理性—十足康德式的理性。朋友你覺得我越說你越糊塗吧，再說下去，恐怕是文一金剛，你更摸不着頭腦了，不過請你恕找，現在說的原是夢啊！</p>
<p>但是，我終於從這夢裏醒過來了。</p>
<p>以下讓我吿訴你一些夢醒後的事。</p>
<p>（也許現在還是在夢中罷，但至少是另一個夢）。在一個月黑的夜裏，為了某種要事偕同一個朋友跑到那只有幾點微暗的燈光炫着的黝黑的江邊去，踏上我平紫不曾坐過的小火輪。船裝滿了一載下流的賣力氣的男女便開了，回頭一望，黑漆漆的獸形的山在伸着　腰，對岸現着，團黑影的山在蹲着，怪物似的俯瞰着我們。</p>
<p>「這船是開到南門去的吧？」一個鄕下女人連迭問了我們兩聲。</p>
<p>「哦，大概是吧。」其實我也茫然。</p>
<p>船一靠岸，我們不管是甚麽地方便上了船。兩輛黃包車載着我們穿過那幽暗靜寂，筆直而狹畏街道，兩旁的矮小的舖戶只漏出微弱的燈光，蹣跚着的儘有工人裝束的瘦影，但是，我總相信，我走的是黑獄似的中古城鎭而不是伯明翰一類的名城。跑了十里八里之後，一條小河。橫在我們的面前。我想起「陰陽河」了、因為回頭是墳墓般的一片幽暗，而前頭是象徵着人間和現代的一派紅燈光和一陣陣的噪音。幾隻瓜皮划千在河邊艤待着，我們隨意踏上一隻划子，船夫只須撑了三篙　把我們渡釗另一個世界的城市去了。</p>
<p>霓紅燈一盞盞從我的眼邊掠過，城市的影也逐漸模糊起來。汽笛呼喝牠的一聲了，車輪子微微的動了。朋友的帽子向我一揚，我擺脫開壓着我心頭的夢魔的手確鑿地感到我眞個在流浪的道上了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 袁塵影</p>
<p>早晨七點撞的時候，便被蒙古包上圓頂孔吹進來的風冷醒了，陣嘟噠嘟噠號聲傳進耳鼓，壯裂中帶一些單調的凄淸，會令人想到這荒淡的原野古代人　着鉦鼓和那種戰馬嘶風的壯景。</p>
<p>在被中伸直了夜都是蜷伏着的腿，厚厚的駝毛被子（註　）也只是像冬天的單衣，一樣抵不住冷，我看了看大家，似乎都不願起身，蒙古包中生的爐火夜間雖然有人添了兩次炭，却也熄了，淸晨的凉風從圓頂孔吹進來，包中更添了無限的冷意。</p>
<p>大家都捨不得離開一夜未溫的被子，却終於被人呼喚着都一骨碌爬起來了。一個穿着汚垢衣服年紀只有十六七歲的靑年走進來給生着火，包中才漸漸的有了些煖意。</p>
<p>忽忽的揩了一把臉，接着喝那年靑的人端過來的開水時，水却是混濁的，上面還有一層油漬，水中有一點羊羯的味道。問那一個年靑人從哪裏來的？說是：「從歸化城來到這裏侍候人家，為得是每月有十元左右的工錢」。</p>
<p>從掛着門帘的蒙古包走出來，這，次我是可以看淸楚整個的白靈廟全景了，西邊的山脚下是馳名的內蒙聖地—白靈廟，各個相連的廟宇估了里長的地方二顏色是紅牆綠瓦，在輝煌的陽光下會照得人眼睛　亮。這個廟不同於歸化的召的是它有不少的巷口任人出入，這時候卻很少有穿着紅袈裟的喇嘛在行動，大概他們是在殿裏念經吧？</p>
<p>我們住的蒙古包是在廟的東北面，距離不過一黑的光景，下了坡便可走向包中來，蒙古包大約有七十多個，分散在四處，都是佔了一塊有兩丈圓的地方，用木架像蓋房似的支起來，上面搭着很厚的毯子，地下也鋪着厚厚的毯子，圓頂的中心有一個四方孔，算是透空氣的，火爐上　鐵烟簡從這裏穿出來，送出爐中的烟，蒙古包中間夾着些軍用帳棚，是蒙古兵在裏面睡的，有幾個蒙古包並列在坡下，從坡上走下去，不小心眞會踏在那上面。</p>
<p>蒙古包前是一條蜿蜒的小河，雖然是夏李了，冰還沒有完全消盡，河的裏面是簇土房，這裏　人管它呌「河東」，那裏住着做買賣的漢人，有幾縷炊烟在裊裊飛散，靜寂的一個人也沒有。（未完）</p>

<p>— 吳廣略</p>
<p>淸晨。</p>
<p>微的曙光，波波的從窗口透進來，整個房室頓時呈現白茫茫的光閃。躺在床上的莫一，翻個轉身，便咕噥地嘶咳一陣。待他底惺忪的睡眼接觸了光波，身體猛然地像受了或種潛意識所襲擊似的痙攀一陣，而立即跳將起來。</p>
<p>莫一醉眼矇矓的三腳兩步走至廳堂，睜開疲倦而孕滿眼糞的眼睛向壁上的時鐘瞧去，看到時針還指在六點的地位，他底緊張的皺臉才恢復平時的寗靜狀態。</p>
<p>「乖乖—辰光還早啦。」</p>
<p>他啞澀的歎道。他這句話含蓄有兩種不同的涵義;他為自已的身體着想，這麽早便起床，身體的休息一定不充分；但他為着保持他的職位，又不便過晏的起床；這兩種矛盾的情緖，使他哀傷，嘴吧上不時的長吁短歎。他起床之後，照例卽打掃廳堂，廊道，階基，天井等處，以及抹檯拭椅，燒水泡茶，……忙得他喘氣，淌汗。他如此慇慇懃懃的克盡厥職為的便是他恐怕得罪了主人而解雇他。</p>
<p>他灣着腰打掃廊道，在沉靜的淸晨時古宅里特有的陰沉之氣象愈令他難堪，他感到有如身處森嚴寂寞的地窖。他抹拭那些在空氣里暴露日久的剝落椅桌，門楣等物，身臨於這些破落戶底徵　中，陡增滅亡及悲慘之感，倍覺自己的老朽以及生命前程的黑暗渺茫。</p>
<p>「莫二，倒洗臉水！」少爺老擺着主人面孔高聲的哼道。家道雖是日益衰微，但是祖先遣下的這種呼婢喚僕的傲態仍然存在。莫二聽到少爺的喊聲，他即手捧臉盆，喘着氣的行往廚下去了。他捧了臉盆之後，耳際即不絕的嗡嗡然響着少爺的聲調，眼前閃現一片黑暗的陰影，一股難言的酸痛又襲擊他的心胸。他彷彿動輒得罪主人而致動搖了他的職位似的。</p>
<p>在恐懼，辛苦的生活中，日子於於一天天的推移過去了。但是，莫二心目中頂可怕的一天又終於臨了啦。</p>
<p>這一天早晨，莫二照例正在打掃廊道，少爺愁眉苦臉的走到他跟前，那末啞聲的說道：「莫……我們實在捨不得你，不過時年不好，租收不起，而捐稅又多，一家人的開消貫無法維持了，所以請你……」少爺苦皺眉峯，把話哽噎下去了。</p>
<p>「少爺，這怎麽成呢？我老了，我沒有親戚故舊。」他悲從中來，老淚滂沱而下。</p>
<p>「現在給你五塊錢路費，你暫且去吧，也許下年時年好，你又可以再來呢。」</p>
<p>「我不去，少爺？」</p>
<p>但在這裏我也沒有辦法呀。</p>
<p>他終於無可如何的收拾了他的簡單行李，行出了這個他住了半世的舊宅。在寒風吹刮的彌漫了灰塵的村道上，他老人家就像沙漠裏孤獨行旅的駱駝在一步一步的向他底人生旅途進發了。</p>
<p>「世界繼啦！　他拭乾淚痕而啞愴地泣歎：「我服侍他的老人家，而且又服侍他成人長大，而今我老了，他便叫我滾蛋，好狠心的人呀，世界變了，變了。</p>
<p>他的眼淚又滾滾的淌下了。</p>
<h3 id="c230">一個人的死（下） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>牙冷距離我們這荒埠頭約莫二十分鐘的火車。可是照老方的病狀看起來他是不能坐火車的；設備不完善的火車對於他沒有好處，於是，在第二天的早上，我被派作護送病人到醫院去的差使，從老板的手裏接過十盾錢老方存下的工資，和五盾錢的預支，講好了一部馬來人的馬車扶着他艱難下了樓，坐在馬車里離開了肥猪樣的老板和麻臉的老板娘，還有那架勝家衣車，向前出發了。</p>
<p>「醫院麽，窮人是進不得的」！一路老方重復地這樣呌着，露出怪樣的牙齒，喘着氣。「你不懂得的，你這小鬼！…咳，你簡直是送我的喪呀」！</p>
<p>「不要胡謅吧」！我制止着他的話。</p>
<p>馬車把我們載到醫院門外，已經是正午時分了。給那魔鬼，般的建築物吸了進去，老方躺在三等病房的床上就要斷氣般的板起鐵靑的嚇人的臉孔。一靜靜地躺下來，不要胡思亂想，你會健康起來的。一我拍着他的肩胛，安慰着。</p>
<p>三等醫院給我的印象現在回憶起來也要戰慄的。一間大病房裏不知道收留了多少人，為疾苦所壓榨出來的悲慘的聲浪充塞着每一個角落：看護婦和病人像是寃家似地對白着。在那裏可以時常聽到這樣的呌喚：</p>
<p>「看護婦！喂，那裏去了？」</p>
<p>「帶點水來吧，我渴死了！」</p>
<p>「搭架子呀，你不給我鬆下纏帶我自己來。等老了發了財的時候看你逃到魔鬼那裏去！」</p>
<p>但是穿白衣的女人背過頭來縐着鼻子，不理睬地走出去了。</p>
<p>在老方比較淸醒的時候，他看見這樣的情景便告訴我道：「嗄，你看到了沒有？小鬼，只有你才把我送到聲院裏來。你以為他們會聲好我的病嗎？天曉得！」便無可奈何地仰天嘆着氣。眼前的事實壓住我的胸膈，使我什麽話也說不出來了。直到了足足兩個鐘頭，才看見那抹著八字鬍子的荷蘭醫生威風凜然地走進來，好容易輪到老方，他把聽筒插在瘦弱的的胸肉上，不住地搖著長滿了紅色頭髮的腦袋。診察在五分鐘內便完了事，看護婦叫我隨著醫生到外邊辦事室裏去拿住院症和付下藥錢。一直弄到差點連最後一班夜車都趕不及，我別了病人回到店裏來。</p>
<p>三天以後我要求老板到醫院去，沒有被允許。「你說，老方是你的什麽？他好會回來的。不要着魔了吧，到廚房裏去，應當是燒飯的時刻了。」他這樣地說。</p>
<p>「老板，他雖然不是我的什麽，總該是店裏的伙計吧。難道不能去看他麽？而且，他恐怕還需要一點錢要送得去。」</p>
<p>「錢？哼，他那裏有錢呀！」</p>
<p>看見他那倔r　的樣子，我又憤怒又驚異地感到愛錢如命的商人眞是沒有救藥的傢伙，打算替老方向店裏的伙計湊一點送到醫院去。但是當我非常高興集凑了三十盾錢，不管老板應許不應許打算搭兩點鐘的火車到他那裏去的時候，醫院裏的通吿送到店裏來了。</p>
<p>「老方怎麼了？」</p>
<p>伙計們靜寂下來，凝神地望着拆開那張紙來的老板，剪的聲響也沒有。他唸完了就垂下剃光了的肥腦袋，「他在今天早上死去了！」他的眼睛望着地板說渚。</p>
<p>「完了，這些錢買一副棺材吧。」我說，心裏邊萬分的悽楚，我想流淚了。</p>
<p>「老方眞是可憐的傢伙，三年來沒有過到舒服的日子。」一個他的同鄉伙計吿訴我。「你知道他的家裏還有妻子和兩個孩子全靠他的養育哪。現在，你想那寡婦孤兒怎樣辦！」</p>
<p>我有許久都忘不了他，常常在望閑下來的時候就想起那高瘦的同，聳著兩隻肩胛的善良的人。他曾經相信過窮人應該結實一些，不能有一天生病，這真理由他自己騐明了。而老板娘在偶而肥起店裏有過這麽一個死去的人，却永遠有一句卑鄙的話掛在她的口上：</p>
<p>「那死鬼療，說起來還欠下店裏五盾錢啊！」</p>

<h3 id="c231">由一胎三男說到獎勵生育 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>前日報載，天津河東一皮匠之妻，一胎三男，母子無恙，街長呈報公安局備案、公安局遂派人前往慰問，並致送麵食多種云。</p>
<p>公安局此舉，似含有若干獎勵生育的意思。不然，生子原極常事，當局决不會派人慰問，及致送食物。若說當局因為一胎三「男」，故這樣重視，那就為我們所不敢贊同了。</p>
<p>提到獎勵生育一事，近來頗有人提倡。意大利的墨索里尼和德國的希特勒，就是兩位熱心者。他們獎勵生育的用意，大家都看得很明白，是在鼓勵全國人民，替國家加工趕造幾個小國民，以備作為未來大戰之用。　　獎勵生育，在我國尙未實行。</p>
<p>我國素以民衆自誇，號稱為四萬萬同胞的大國，對於生育，似乎是無需獎勵的。然而不然。我國，雖然人口衆多，但每年因天災人禍而死亡的數目，也着實驚人。一回大水，就死了幾百萬幾千萬。一次旱災，也死了幾百萬幾千萬。因內戰而犧牲於槍砲之下的，亦同樣算不淸。若天不留情，人不留情，照這樣死下去，四萬萬人口，將來也不難變成三萬萬二萬萬。這實在値得注意。</p>
<p>可是要獎勵生育，在目前的中國，也還有問題。因為人口和食物，兩者有密切的關係。人口一增加，食物亦須隨之而增加。但現在的中國，人多飯少，許多人正在挨餓。若再獎勵起生育來，勢必無法養活。這更是値得顧慮。</p>
<h3 id="c232">「聾」老頭 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>——舊感之一——</p>
<p>這老頭，是我們黃鎭上的一個出衆人物。提起他來，凡是住在離黃鎭三五十里遠的人，恐沒有一個不認識的吧。但是他到底是什麼名字，他原來的家，究竟是在那里，這些是很少有人能淸楚地道出來的；不過，因他年紀老，耳朶有點聾，而且在黃鎭上又住得很久，所以，我們都全呌他做「聾」老頭。</p>
<p>他沒有正當的職業，也沒有一個像樣的家。他的住所，是在市街的尾末處的那一間矮小的破廟裏；他靠着打發日子的唯一方法，是到處行乞。雖然他的年紀是這麽老，——鬚眉完全雪白了，背脊已經駝了，但看來還似很健旺：他能喝醇厚的酒，吃得多量的飯菜，每天能走三四十里的山路。不管是放晴，還是落雨，東方一發了白，他就携着拐杖，背上一隻葫蘆，一個破舊的草袋，帶着他那一隻時日不離的黃狗，離開廟門，走向鄰近的村落中去：直至太陽落了山，才又帶着微醉的酒意，　　地走回來。</p>
<p>他過的雖然同是乞丐生活，但比起旁的呌化子來，可又有些二樣：在平時，他不常打擾人家，但一到了誰家有了什麽婚嫁的喜事時，在『吉日』的前幾天，他就會不招而自來了。他一進了門，用不着他自己開口，主人早就明白他的來意了。這時主人就得拿出三百文銅錢，先放進他的草袋裏，再搶過他的葫蘆來，滿裝一葫蘆醇原的酒：另外還得備下三二樣可口的菜，擺在他的面前，　懃地招呼他。主人將這些應盡的義務』做完後，他就會從他的草袋中摸出幾張印着符咒似的大字的紅紙，交給主人到處張着。這些紅紙的效用，據說是專用來壓制旁的呌化子的。如果沒有了這一些，一到了『吉日』的那一天，就會有髏骷似的呌化子成羣結隊地到來打鬧，敎你不能好好地過去了；因為他走這門路久，資格老，他是有這驅策後來的同行的法力的。但是，這也只是從老年人的口中說出來的傳說罷了，他這法力究竟是否有效，是從未曾有過事實來證明的。不過，住在黃鈸這一區域里的莊稼人家，過的日子倒也頗滿足和稱意，一生一世也沒有逢過幾回婚嫁的大日子，就多花幾個錢，是誰也不大在意的。所以聾老頭的生命就能這樣舒適地支撑過去了。</p>
<p>過着寄生生活的聾老頭，照理是當招人家的鄙棄和厭惡的吧，但是他的遭遇並沒有這樣的不幸。。人家敬愛他，歡喜他；不管是誰瞥見了他的影子走進村子來，都會十分興奮地高聲招呼着：『聾老頭來了，聾老頭來了！』這時間在家裏的男女老幼們，總會不約而同地走向他這邊來。不大見世面的孩子們，平時一遇見生人，總像閏女似的躱躱避避，但是他們不怕聾老頭，一看見聾老頭走進來，他們就成夥地把他包圍起來，要求他說故事，講新聞；而他的肚子裏</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>也好像早就裝好一本故事的本子似的，孩子的要求，是從不曾被拒絕過的。就使這些孩子是多麼潑刺，他也老是那麽慈祥地微笑着，像對他自己的孫子一樣，這個頭上摸了摸，那個頭上摸了摸。　時故事說完了，還會和老一輩的談一通世故人情，談些他所聞見的新鮮事兒；及至談至傷感處，也會互對着深長地嘆息一二聲。這樣的談着，至少總得逗留一二個鐘頭，才辭別走向另一個村子去。老年人，眼睜睜地送着他漸漸小下去的背景，總會失神地喃喃自話着。。『眞是命長……眞是……』</p>
<p>我離開黃鎭，計算來已是七八年了。在這一大串的日子裏，我不管是在書本上，戲臺上，馬路上，……凡是遇見一個鬚眉雪白，背脊微駝的老年人時，第一個飄進我腦子來的影，總是這個聾老頭。——這老頭給予我的印象是太深了！但未曉得他現在是否也還活在那裏，他靠着過活的黃鎭，是否也還保有牠舊的那個樣子！？</p>
<h3 id="c233">塵沙 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>讀陶淵明詩，讀了「人生無根蒂，飄如陌上塵。」兩句的時候，便為一種突來的悲戚所撫住了，持着書本的手遂也懶洋洋地弛放下來，眼前的境界在一霎那間也漸漸黯淡下去，過去生活的歷史一頁頁地在腦中翻過，吟味着那詩句，想，人生眞是如塵沙一般漂蕩無定啊！但這塵沙還不是什麽陌上的輕塵，而是無限荒凉的沙澳中隨狂風而馳走的沙土。你曾見過那種北國塵土的景象沒有？風起來時，一粒粒拚凑成一張濃黃色的霧幔，把晴朗的天宇整整遮住，然後飄颺，飄颺，有的飄到屋頂，有的飄到樹梢，有的飄入流水，無論牠飄向那裏，取着什麼樣的姿態，始終脫離不了那種被命運播弄的把戲。塵土也許是無知的，也許是悲哀的吧？誰知道。但牠漂流却是眞的。沒有一定的家，沒有一定的去處，雖說是自由，但是那種前途茫茫後顧茫茫的滋味，恐怕不是身當其境的不能想像得到吧？當狂風初起，黃沙蔽天，看到自己在半空中是這麽渺小無力的可怪，又看到無數同伴們也被着不可抗拒的勢力所操縱，連一些選擇的力量都沒有，等到剛抱定一根憔悴的樹枝，剛剛棲定一片蕭蕭的草葉，剛剛落到了地面，而自己慶幸能够逃出風的魔手，把疲乏的生命休息下來，重新看看晴和世界的美麗的時候，冷不防又是一陣風起，連喘息都來不及地更得拖着遲重的身子，奔向無定的長途，於是再停心，再被播　，亳沒有終了的時候，直到這塵沙攀附上某一家的窗欞，或是隱匿到比較安靜的地方，然而經了不久的風吹雨打，也就溶化，消散，而奄奄一息了。從生出來就漂泊無定，整個生涯就是從風霜雨雪的侵襲中度過來，這樣，就是一顆塵沙的身世了。可是這樣的身世，和我的又怎麽那樣出奇的相像呢？你可怪的塵沙，無定的塵沙，被人播弄的塵沙啊！</p>
<p>想到這裏，我眼睛漸漸地閉攏下去。</p>
<p>記得屠格湼甫的小說裏曾描寫過一個意志薄弱的人，他說：「我正如從山上滾下來的石頭，停不住自己。」我所說的停不住自己的塵沙也正是這個樣子。每天每天，當我從街衢上散步回來的時侯，對着面前熙來攘往的車馬，總禁不住有種幻想。我想在我前後左右的人們，也正如一粒塵沙前後左右的許多粒塵沙，由於什麼力量所推動，不由自主地在名利塲中爭逐着。而且這風是無北息地在吹，讓你飄揚，顚簸，直等到你再沒有力量隨着那風飄起來的時候，那麼就從半空悄悄地墜落下來，另一層塵沙便把你掩埋了。在這環境裏，一個人的力量該顯得多麼小呢？</p>
<p>生活在這世上眞是一個極重大的苦役，你走不動也得走，停止了又得重新振作，甚至累得躓仆了，也得喘息着爬起來，再奔向無窮無盡的前途。風的力量太大了，什麽時候，讓我們抱定一株小草，傍着活撥的流溪，作一回舒適的酣美的夢呢？什麽時侯，讓我們撇開沉重的担子，恢復一下健康的元氣呢？在這脩阻的長途上旅人是疲乏得支持不住了。</p>

<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>倘使我以一種獵奇者底姿態，底趣味，在六月天底黃昏底晚風里，踏著輕捷的步子，飄落在都會底核心了呢！那是容易使我贊嘆的。像我這樣地一個不曾素稔於都會的人，難道也有一些膽識來否定了都會底一切値得贊嘆的地方？於是，我輕輕的在心里贊嘆著，雖然，我還不敢把贊嘆的聲音，引起了人家底</p>
<p>我學習了屬於雅致一類的神氣，踱著一條條的水門汀的人行道。我沐浴在紅的，綠的，霓虹燈底妖艷的光彩中，如果我有一種幻覺的習慣的話；那末，我會疑心著走進了妖魔女底夜花園裹，千萬樣奇異的珍貴的花，全是把顏色在黑暗中變成光放射著。那是很容易把一顆莊端靜穆的男子的心，逗弄得如同脫離了常軌的星球一樣地，願意去溶解在那些妖艷的光底媚力下的哪！可是，我卽使也曾瞬息地，有過一種要想這樣地去　試的膽量，但那只是很快的一個意念而已，是被找底僧恨的情緒所掩滅，縱然，有著各別類型的女性胴體，裹在一層薄薄的彷彿是稀微的月光似的輕紗，播故著肉底光芒與肉底異香，均勻地給予每一個行路的人。這在那些浮遊似的女性胴體底觀念來解釋，覺得這種亳不吝嗇的獻示著自己底色相，是很有獨具的韻味的。（不過這個解釋里，並不曾包含著給人有一親芳澤的機會的。如果你却是一個與她有著更高的身份和更多的錢的話，那末，我底關於上述的解釋的申明，便會失去他底效用的。）自然，這一隊隊的符合於希臘底古典的美的女性胴體，一個個地從大都會底夜的街上巡行過。更使用了滿有愛嬌，滿有風韻的姿態，以及相像裝滿了熱熾的柔情的眼波；最能够使得口袋里不會有多的紙幣的年靑人憂鬱，但却也更能够使得一個圓壯肥軀的紳士們，生了難以抑化的雅興而這種雅興，也常因為有著多的紙幣，足以帮助他成為事實的綠故，於是，那些富於媚態的女性胴體，很快地便鑽進了紳士底司蒂蓓克底車廂裏。而不久又出現於急奏著古啻族的音樂底旋律里，在光滑的坡璃地板上姍姍起舞了！</p>
<p>都會是動的，有著機械性的動，也有著不規則的動。然而在大都會底夜之街頭，那末，動的速率是加强的，動的範疇是擴大的，動的類別也是更複雜的。若你尙有一點耐心，你能够看見鋼輪咬著鐵軌，橡皮輪咬著土瀝靑的路面，霓虹光咬住欲歸的人們的心，年靑淑女底美麗胴體底光彩，咬住多情男子底慾念，街頭的夜鶯的廉價的性機能，咬住性飢蕩者　興趣。於是渲染於都會夜景以極　　的　彩。（若使我還不失為一個善於說話的人，那末我是不會說，這些極濃厚的油彩里，是罪惡所作為重要的成分的哪！）</p>
<p>然則，由於我與人家底興味的不同，我被都會夜景，注射了多量的憂鬱了！誠然，現在資本主義底力量，足以建設了人世底外表的美奐。可是，我相信毀滅了人世底外表的美奐的，依舊是資本主義本身，不但他是徒勞的，而且也是多餘的。於是我疑心自己底口哨的憂鬱的調子，是在替這世紀，唱著殯歌。</p>

<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>一間簡陋的臥室，裏面祗橫着一隻板舖，一堆破舊的被絮和幾襲破衣服，就雜亂地堆在上面，在角落裏有一個孩子睡在那裏，兩隻凳子也隨便地擺在舖邊，窗前放着一張舊半桌，傍邊一隻洋風爐却沒有點着火，四週的牆壁上的堊粉全已變成了黑灰色，室裏的空氣是死寂得可怕的。那時萍華正坐在臨窗的那隻舊半桌上，提起一支筆來想寫信給一位表兄，託他在漢口設法替他找一件事情做做，但一想起那表嫂的勢利面孔，並前次筠倩到他家裏去受的侮辱，他便將一張剛寫好二行字的八行箋撕得粉碎，紙片飛滿了一地；他猛然的將兩隻手拚命地抓住了自己的頭髮，一對沒有神的眼珠子凝視着窗外，看見幾支小麻雀落在電綫上修翅膀，饑餓和悲痛却儘在他腦子裏交織着！</p>
<p>「呀」！了一聲，孩子在鋪上醒了，筠倩忙從破被堆裏抱了他起來。那個綠週歲的孩子也瘦得只剩了一爿皮；就是哭起來，也祗有那樣無力的抽搐和低微的聲音。頭頸是細而又軟，眞是已像一個垂死的孩子了。</p>
<p>「孩子……你也生得…命苦，所…以才會投到了…這樣一個…爹媽……」她說着兩行辛酸之淚像山洪一樣地漲發了，撲簌簌地淚珠從她的臉上跌下去落孩子的頰上；她看看孩子，將一個浸滿了淚水的瘦臉緊貼在孩子的臉上，但是孩子還是使勁地哭。「孩子…媽的奶水乾了］孩子］媽沒有飯吃那裏有奶來給你吃呢！」</p>
<p>他悲哀地瞥了一下孩子和妻，想：她們也眞苦，筠倩自從和我結了婚之後</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，她就沒有安安逸逸的過着一天，結婚不到一年，自己就失了業，如今又多了一個孩子，將近一年來的失業生活，當的當光了，賣的賣完了。現在可以値些錢的東西也沒了。東奔西走，差不多親戚朋友的地方也都到過，但是結果所得到的，只是冷酷的侮辱和輕蔑的譏諷！然而生意旣找不到，自己又沒吿貸的地方，怎樣再能够維持下去呢？單講這裏住的一個三層閣，每月也要四塊錢房金；現在已經欠了三個月，二房東的面孔已不像先前那麼和善，望得見將要下逐客之令快了。可是我們的肚子裏已二天沒有好好吃過一頓，現在委實有些傲耐不住起來，胸口的淸水只咕囉咕囉的往上直冒，那又酸又甜的滋味兒，比什麼東西都難舊！</p>
<p>「嚓！這這勢利的世界！」他恨恨的在桌上搥了一下。</p>
<p>「前天我看見報紙上招請女職員的廣吿，我倒去試了一下，他們考試的資格只是品貌的美麗和年紀要輕，所以我應試的結果據說是合格的，但是今天接到他們的通知書說還要二百元保證……」筠倩想起了前日去應考的事情，不禁有些憤慨；接着她就將一封團得很皺的信擲在萍華面前！</p>
<p>「這些都是騙子」！萍華一把抓起信來就扯。</p>
<p>兩個人又靜默着，哀愁和痛苦却緊緊地眾住在這間房裏，孩子的哭呌也不知在什麼時候停止了。</p>
<p>「萍，我還是想到薦頭店裏去問問看，也許有人家要僱用奶媽。或者娘姨，讓我去幹一下看，維持了目前的生活再說，反正窮人還要講什麼面子，連了性命也在保不住」！她一大串的話，跟來了兩大串的眼淚，但是她還想强作歡顏，不使萍華過份傷心！</p>
<p>「但是孩子呢」？萍華也忍不住哭了：猛的抱住了筠倩，把臉貼在她的亂髮上：「筠，你苦了，我怎樣能够讓你去受這樣的委曲呢」？</p>
<p>「我看孩子還是送到育嬰堂裏去吧！一方面保全了他的一條小生命，而同時你和我也好去找些土作做做。」</p>
<p>「筠！」他用淚眼望着她喊了一聲，却說不出安慰的話來。</p>
<p>「萍！怎麼啦？」她悲哀地替他拭着眼淚，把兩天沒有吃東西的肚子饑餓也忘記了，祇有痛苦和悲哀佔據了他們兩人之間。</p>

<h3 id="c243">近代建築裏的醫院設計 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>六月六日下午八時，本埠香港大學同學會，假座銀行俱樂部開會，中外名流到會者甚多，意大使館秘書G　G.　Cihadini　cesi侯爵亦撥冗蒞臨，由王道安君主席、特請CHelazzi君演講「近代建築裏的醫院設計」，關於建築醫院上之新計劃，均有詳細闡明，Chelazzi君係著名之築建師，近在天津，曾獲英租界工部局醫院設計競賽之優勝者，此次演講，對於近代建築界，定有不少貢獻，茲將演詞原稿，譯為中文，披露如左：</p>
<p>假使有人呌我給近代建築下個定義，我可以决不猶豫地說：近代建築要含有下列的各種均衡：</p>
<p>（一）綫和色的均衡—以簡單樸質來創造美。</p>
<p>（二）內和外的均衡—外觀要引起人的快戚，而內部要切合實用。</p>
<p>（三）光和影的均衡—充分利用光綫，當牠是有益的時候；而同時供給一種障蔽，當牠是有害的時候。</p>
<p>（四）通氣的均衡—就是在需要的時候，風和空氣得以充分流通。</p>
<p>近代建築不僅是注重外觀的表面，而是以創造的藝術求各方的利用。所以近代的醫院建築，是用新方法來供給安通與便利的。</p>
<p>就以本人所設計的天津英租界醫院做個例，這就是根據簡單，整齊，直率，再加以空氣動力學而設計的。近年來中國在建設方面固然已經有了長足的進步，但是醫院的建築—尤其在內地—遂威覺迫切的需要。在中國計劃醫院，除了普通問題以外，還得攷慮到當地的情形。就個人的意見，最重要的要算是氣侯的情形。冬季天律的風向是北和西北，夏季是東南；所以我就把病房放在南部，而北部則作為工作的部份。這樣，病房在夏季有充分的空氣流通，在各季無凛冽的北風襲擊。至於陽光，我把病房佔得如此的地位，使牠可以充分得着陽光的利益。病房連着陽台，所以障蔽夏天的炎日，而冬天的陽光却可無阻碍地從陽台射入。</p>
<p>根據三十年的紀載，天津的平均最低溫度是華氏二·九二度，最低是零下四度。所以我想最好把室內的溫度定為六十六度。茲為减少外牆傳熱起見，外牆的構造是用一層六英寸空磚，一層四英寸空瓦，中間隔着一層五英寸空氣層。再為减少熱的損失起見，窗子的構造是用雙層，而加以平衡框；這種窗子的好處，在可以盡量的開，而且沒有直桿，光綫的透入比較更充分。</p>
<p>醫院本身之外，還有看護住所，管理員住所，醫師住所，都造在另一部份，不與醫院相連。僕役住所在西部。太平間在西南部。另開一門出入。</p>
<p>就本人的見解，醫院四周的風景，是値得特別注意的。樹木，草地，綠陰：的行人道，噴水池，池沼以及坐椅之類，都是很需要的。</p>
<p>以大體論，醫院的建築以集中在一處為宜，因為所佔的地面和所耗的開支，都比較散開的來得經濟。</p>
<p>每層的病室都預備着一個活動門，通到一個汚布溝：所有污濁的布都收集到這個溝裏，而直接輸送到底層洗衣作的容納箱裏去。污布經過各種洗滌之後，就放在離電梯很近的一間送布室裏，而直接分送到各層儲布室。每層也有一個垃圾溝，直接通到鎔燬爐而燬化了。廚房是在最高一層，因為經騐吿訴我們，廚房若是在下面，那種氣味對於病人很有妨害，縱是用盡了方法也不能免的。</p>
<p>手術室設計在北部，使手術床在白天的時候可以得到很平均的光綫。流通空氣和供給煖氣是一個很愼重的問題。經過深切的研究，才决定用分別暖冷制，先把空氣用熱决消毒後，再冷到適當的溫氣而送到各手術室裏。</p>
<p>總之，近代醫院的設計，包括着許多工程和建築的問題，跟着醫學的進步而日見其複什的。從事於這種設計工作的人，應當將自已的工作認為神聖的，因為他或許也是個造福人類的間接工具呢。</p>

<p>至現在，雙幢二樓或三樓之衖堂房，建築者已形减少，流行市上最新式者，則為二層或三層兩節式，其特點卽將底層客堂改深五六尺，由一假門截為前後二間，後間亦可作為飯廳，房間高度，較從前减低一尺左右，樓頂空處，則作為存儲室，於居住上，極稱便利，不過租價較普通式樣貴十分之一二，二樓者，月租六七十元，三樓約九十元左右，只合中產階級居住，中下階級則不能享受，且老式衖堂房，或有大花園之洋房，一經拆除，則改造新式，如此下去，房屋必將過剩，而現在居住老式衖堂房之中下階級，將來居住上，亦必發生恐慌，就是現在，看各報上之召租與减租之廣吿，可知已漸呈衰落現象，故以後之式樣，仍有改革之必要，以現在之情形觀之，大約有二種辦法，一為廢除前面之天井，將二三樓縮進六七尺，則與前衖房屋之距離，仍可維持現在之寬度，底層距離，似嫌太近，如將樓上讓出之屋面，改作玻璃頂，則光綫空氣，仍不至受影響，現在許多衖堂房，且多為新式者，間有不設天井，僅設一門套通達衖堂，又衖堂內蘇廣成衣舖，往往將天井上搭成玻璃項，二者卽可為上述式樣之憧景也，再則使整幢房全部縮小，成一小型住宅，就以單獨座洋房言，現在新造者，如福履里路，愚園路，市中心區一帶，多為小型洋房，若巨賴達路之大型洋房，投資者絕無建築的了，可知衖堂房，實有縮小之趨勢，至內外裝飾與設備，亦有簡單之傾向，因現在空間之衖堂房，多為富麗華貴也，新建之單獨洋房，大約平頂者多為立體式，尖頂者則作西班牙式，這種式樣，工料皆省，且又極為美觀，受人之歡迎，故能風行也，公寓建築之趨勢，大約小規模者，（包括六宅或八宅）每宅之容量與房間之面積極大，裝飾及設備，亦富麗堂皇，窮極奢侈，如最近築成之邁爾西愛路Grosvenor　apt　Ostrid　apt.與善鐘路霞飛路角之公寓，皆是也，緣公寓在上海之歷史，亦不過十餘年，且大多數皆近三五年建築，多為新式，以其舒適，便利，與安全，甚為一般富人，——尤其是外國人——所歡迎，故大公寓內，各宅容量加大，數量减少，以其便於出租也，如地豐路新造之Yue　Tuck　apt.共有大宅十二所，小宅十四所，大宅現皆租出，小宅多數租不出，可知只要大，租價雖高，並無影饗，如數年前上海之舞場影院之建築，愈出愈奇者，同出一轍也，至將來之趨勢，亦不免與衖房，或單獨洋房，同一情形耳，、（本叚所述，只限於市房，至私人自　　造之住宅，不在此例）</p>

<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>——關於築塲裏用——</p>
<p>絞練—在高呼提倡國貨的吾國，對於外貨的充滿市塲，其每月的進項，着實驚人，而尤以建築界裏，好像築塲裏用的絞練，（Butt　or　Hinge）差不多舶來品的比較多，（國貨可以說沒有）它是門或窗必需利用的兩爿連帶有旋轉性的金屬物，考究的有彈簧的。（寫至此報吿一個可喜的消息，就是建築上比較考究的鐵窗鐵門，中國人也會做了。）</p>
<p>插梢—插梢（Bolt）是用以防制門或窗遇大風時驟開驟閉被吹動的一種用具。也是舶來品，有一種呌法蘭西插梢，在門或窗的上下冒頭都可以使之關閉的，其中間有旋動的執手。</p>
<p>扛籮—築塲裏最掃除不掉的就是垃圾，而沒有垃圾就難成其為築塲，因為垃圾的產量是從木屑刨花以及拆下水泥壳子的水泥屑等等變成的。可是對於出淸垃圾，難免小工，（作頭用的，築塲裏稱大包小工。）而小工必需用掃帚和扛籮，（Basket）這扛籮就是用以載隨便什麽用不到的廢物的。</p>
<p>扛繩—就是穿扛籮的繩子。</p>
<p>扛棒—就是扛扛籮的捧頭，這是用粗毛竹做成的。</p>
<p>木屑—用鋸子在木料上鋸下的，就呌木屑</p>
<p>刨花用是用刨在木料上刨下的，就呌刨花。</p>
<p>柴爿—折壳子板用銅捧撓時不留心被破裂的木塊，就呌柴爿，關於柴爿和木屑和刨花，在築場裏堆積起來，有專門做這項生意的人來講價兜賣，這是築塲裏的廢物利用。差不多比較工程大的築塲對於這三者的交易的進項上是大有可觀的，築塲裏還有人來兜買的是水泥空袋和用不着的局頭（詳前）鐵等。</p>
<p>鋼棒—鋼棒（Steel　Stice）是築塲裏用塲最廣的用具，如折壳子板，起洋釘，撓載重的東西等。</p>
<p>老虎窗——普通弄堂住房或街房之類，本來建造的時候是二層樓式樣的，可是做二房東的希望在租金上多出產些，於是不管三房客舒適不舒適，將本來二層的搭了一個擱，便成為三層，不過空氣方面難免窒塞，做二房東的就在屋項上開一道天窗（Sky　Light）或者像屋面似蓋起「一面瀉水」的小屋，這就是老虎窗，至於老虎云者，大概開窗的地位，正似老虎的大嘴吧而名之。</p>
<p>「一面瀉水」——這句「一面瀉水」，也是築塲裏許多做手們講在嘴上的習慣話。意思就是祗有一面地位漏雨水的，瀉水就是反水的第二名稱。</p>
<p>老司務——假使有人要到築塲裏訪友，或者在某一件事須要找個人帮助。那末，築塲裏所見到的是泥水木匠的許多做手們，但對於稱呼他們當然是不能以做手代呼，或者喂呔之類的瞎搭，因為做手們差不多智識淺薄的居多，必須給他們佔些小便宜，所以對於做手們不妨統呌老司務，實在老司務三字之在築塲上，自作頭老板，下至小「學生意」，都可以應用，並不是一定限於敲敲弄弄的做手們的。</p>
<p>刷板——刷板的意思，就是一種企口板或其他板類如建松板等所做成的一道隔斷的陬屛。好像普通弄堂住房或街房之類，在客堂或樓面用刷板劃成為二。前者稱前客堂前樓，後者稱後客堂後樓等，這種刷板用得最多的要算小客棧的一間一間鴿子籠似的房間。</p>
<p>側石——馬路的人行道的邊傍鑲以石料的，就是側石，對於房尾的最先的手績，就根據側石或馬路背的高度以作房屋基地的高度之標準，所以側石（Curt）或馬路背已成為築塲裏開工的第一步關口。（待續）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hebei Issue: Hope for Peaceful Resolution, Foreign Dispatch Reports Our Side Has Accommodated Demands, Japanese Troops Mobilize in Yangcun Amid Peaceful Sounds, Japanese Kwantung Army Holds Staff Meeting <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Hebei issue, both sides are still in ongoing negotiations. Yesterday, Isoya, Sakai, Takahashi, and others met with He [Yingqin], urging further action. However, given the current situation, as our side consistently adheres to the principle of peace, seeking a satisfactory resolution to avoid escalating the situation, we have been gradually fulfilling all possible issues within the scope of mutual understanding. The Japanese side has expressed considerable understanding of the sincerity of our authorities. Therefore, the situation has now shifted towards moderation, and it is hoped that it will not escalate. Once the central government's reply telegram arrives in Beiping, this issue can be brought to a conclusion. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Military Attaché Isoya boarded the Pingpu express train at 10:40 PM on the 10th, returning to Shanghai ahead of schedule due to matters. At 9:30 AM on the 11th, a Japanese plane will fly from Chengde to Tianjin, bringing Nagata, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Ministry, to meet with Commander Umezu and Chief of Staff Sakai. The empty plane will fly to Beiping to pick up Military Attaché Takahashi to Chengde. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Beiping, He Yingqin's reply fully accommodates the Japanese demands of May 29th. (10th Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) China's swift fulfillment of Japan's demands has transformed the pessimistic outlook on the Sino-Japanese issue into optimism this afternoon. This morning, the Beiping Party Headquarters closed its doors and ceased operations. The withdrawal of troops has already begun. Military activities are taking place throughout the province. The Central Military Police 3rd Regiment left Beiping yesterday and is reportedly heading to Shanxi Province. The 51st Army under Yu Xuezhong has been ordered to enter Shaanxi Province and will be stationed in Fengxiang. Guan Linzheng, commander of the 25th Division, has announced to the student military training class that the class must be suspended because he will be going elsewhere. The Shanxi troops under Shang Zhen are preparing to go to Tianjin, with their main force currently stationed in Tongzhou. It is estimated that only these Shanxi troops will remain in Hebei Province. It is reported that the Northeastern Army under Wan Fulin will also be withdrawn from Hebei Province. Thus, all Central Army and Northeastern Army troops in Hebei Province will be completely withdrawn. This afternoon, it was reported that the Beiping authorities have received instructions from Nanjing, approving the disbandment of the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters and the withdrawal of troops from Hebei Province. The Japanese authorities have instructed the railway bureau to prepare eight special trains to transport new recruits arriving at Tanggu from Japan on June 12th to Tianjin. They have also instructed the preparation of eight trains on June 16th to transport Japanese troops currently stationed in Tianjin, whose term has expired, to Tanggu for embarkation and return to their country. Locals believe that the return of Japanese troops from Tianjin is the best indication that the situation is gradually returning to normal and that a complete resolution is gradually taking shape. When the Military Police 3rd Regiment left Beiping last night, the station platforms were filled with soldiers and their families, with luggage and equipment piled everywhere. The Pinghan Railway was bustling with train sounds all night. It is reported that two divisions of the Central Army will also be transferred out within two weeks. The reason they have not departed yet is that the transportation of troops requires some time for arrangement. According to today's Dalian telegraph, Doihara has left Dalian for Shenyang and will not come to Tianjin, as the situation in North China has been resolved, so Doihara changed his itinerary.

<p>(Chengdu) Chairman Chiang attended the second expanded memorial week this morning and gave instructions, discussing the bandit suppression issue in Sichuan Province. He first stated that the people of the entire nation are currently paying attention to the bandit suppression issue in Sichuan Province, because if the Sichuan bandits are not eliminated, not only will the people of Sichuan Province be unable to live and work in peace, but the nation will also be unable to embark on the road to recovery. He then discussed the methods of eliminating the Red bandits, saying that one cannot rely solely on military force; one must fully unleash social forces, with "70% politics and 30% military affairs." Political power resides entirely in society. If leaders from all walks of life can lead the masses, so that society is organized, trained, and orderly, and its strength is consolidated, then it will be an easy matter to eliminate a few tens of thousands of Red bandits with the overwhelming majority of 70 million people. Chairman Chiang then pointed out various bad habits in Sichuan society, and encouraged leaders from all walks of life to work together to reform customs, boost morale, and train the people, placing even greater emphasis on training the people than on training the army. Finally, Chairman Chiang, in a solemn tone, warned all generals not to harbor a mentality of despising the Red bandits. He said that if the armies do not seriously rectify themselves and continue to repeat the bad habits of oppressing the people, they will not only fail to eliminate the Red bandits, but will also be eliminated by the Red bandits, dying without a burial place and forever becoming historical sinners. Chairman Chiang concluded by saying that there is no one in the world who cannot be used; it all depends on how the leaders train and educate them. The instructions lasted 40 minutes, and were attended by Liu Xiang, He Guoguang, and over a thousand representatives from various circles. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Reorganization of the British Cabinet <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The British National Government, established nearly four years ago, was reorganized on the 7th of this month. This kind of political change was long expected and is not surprising. In recent years, the Conservative Party has always held a large majority in Parliament. The so-called National Labour Party of the MacDonald faction has been insignificant. The reason why the former Mr. MacDonald was appointed Prime Minister was only because the Conservative Party wanted to use him as a temporary puppet. The de facto Prime Minister was Baldwin, not MacDonald. Therefore, this reorganization of the cabinet was only a matter of time. Since last winter, discontent with MacDonald has been increasingly and openly expressed. On the part of the anti-government Labour Party, MacDonald was hated to the core for betraying the Labour Party. At the same time, from Labour's perspective, the economic panic in Britain in the autumn of 1931 no longer existed. The National Government was no longer necessary. Yet MacDonald continued to advocate maintaining the National Government, seemingly only to protect his personal position. Therefore, the Labour Party's attacks on MacDonald became more intense. The views of those in the Liberal Party who opposed the current government were similar. Furthermore, the Labour Party saw considerable success in the local elections in Britain last winter. This shows that public sentiment is moving towards the revival of party politics, not the maintenance of the National Government. This development made MacDonald's prestige decline, which was very obvious. When the British Parliament convened on January 28th of this year, someone even openly scolded MacDonald as a liar, a pig, and an incompetent and lowly dog who should immediately leave politics. Ten days later, MacDonald gave a speech somewhere, strongly arguing for the necessity of maintaining the National Government. The audience all imitated cat meows in response. Whether this kind of open insult and ridicule came from the Labour Party or was instigated by the Conservative Party is unknown. However, MacDonald's unpopularity could no longer be concealed. In recent days, news of MacDonald's resignation has been repeatedly reported. Informed people have long known that he would retreat in the face of difficulties.</p>
<p>Now that the British cabinet has been reorganized, Baldwin is not only the de facto Prime Minister, but also the Prime Minister in name. In his policy platform, Baldwin still advocates maintaining the National Government, while allocating four cabinet seats to the National Labour Party and two seats to the National Liberal Party. This seems to be an attempt to co-opt these figures in order to isolate the opposition in Parliament. In fact, the power of the National Government has been greatly weakened. Therefore, it is fair to say that this cabinet is a transition to a coalition party cabinet. In the future, British domestic and foreign policy may still undergo some changes, but the changes should not be too drastic. During the MacDonald era, British domestic and foreign policy had already adopted Conservative Party policies, such as reducing unemployment benefits, cutting salaries of civil servants, adopting protective tariffs, and expanding the army, navy, and air force, all of which were contrary to the traditional policies of the Labour and Liberal parties. Therefore, it can be inferred that the future Britain will, at most, slightly increase and promote these policies and will not reverse all of the previous cabinet's policies.</p>
<p>However, in foreign policy, Britain's attitude may become slightly more explicit. The change of foreign secretary is the beginning. During the MacDonald era, important diplomatic positions were held by Simon or MacDonald himself. Simon was a Liberal, and MacDonald was a Labourite. Their diplomatic views were naturally closer. In terms of each party's foreign policy, the Labour and Liberal parties were relatively passive and peaceful, while the Conservative Party was relatively active. Now that the position of Foreign Secretary has been changed to Hoare of the Conservative Party, some changes are inevitable. There are two things to pay attention to here: one is the German question, and the other is the Far East question. Baldwin once said that Britain's defense line is now no longer in Dover, but in the Rhine. After Baldwin made this statement, Britain's navy and air force began to expand separately. At the same time, the coordination of Britain, France, and Italy was also facilitated. Baldwin's apprehension towards Germany can be seen here. Furthermore, there are many anti-Germans in the Conservative Party, such as Churchill, Gilmour, and Beaverbrook. Therefore, whether Britain's future defense against Germany can be eliminated is a question. As for the Far East, Baldwin said not long ago that if the United States and Britain could cooperate, it would not be difficult to maintain peace in any part of the world. This shows that Baldwin intends to cooperate with the United States. According to observations from Washington, DC, yesterday, it was also the same. If Baldwin's words are truly sincere, then there will be important developments in Britain's foreign policy in the future.</p>

He said, "Recent events have convinced us that the guarantees of European peace are not as solid today as they were before. In order to rescue the situation, we must redouble our efforts to create a collective security system and to strengthen all guarantees arising from the League of Nations' legal system. Since some parties are still resisting the collective security system in an orderly manner, those of us who support this system should also strengthen our activities." (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Czech Foreign Minister Benes met with Soviet Communist Party Secretary Stalin yesterday for a conversation lasting an hour. It is reported that Benes described in detail to Stalin the internal and foreign affairs situation of the Czech Republic, expressed the hope of the Czech government to reach a better understanding with Poland, and advocated that Austria's independence should be absolutely guaranteed. Benes has a high reputation in Eastern and Central European diplomatic circles, and therefore he can try to enable the Soviet Union to contact the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries. The Little Entente countries are scheduled to hold a standing political conference on June 20. Benes plans to report to the conference the results of his visit to Moscow. He also plans to hold talks with the Yugoslav government to restore normal relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia as soon as possible. From this point of view, the scope of application of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Czech Republic is very broad. Benes told reporters from Havas News Agency, "The Czech Republic is not only a link between the Soviet Union and the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries, but also a link between the Soviet Union and all European countries together with France. Friends of the Soviet Union have realized the importance of the position of the Czech Republic, which I dare to say." (Havas dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) As Czech Foreign Minister Benes is currently visiting here, Molotov and Stalin hosted him at Molotov's office. While the two sides talked at length in a friendly atmosphere, People's Foreign Commissar Litvinov, Czech Ambassador to the Soviet Union Pavlov, and Soviet Ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexandrovsky were also present. After the talks, Molotov hosted a special lunch, which was attended by Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Mikoyan, Chubar, Mezhlauk, Rozengolts, Rudzutak, Kalmanovich, Pyatnitsky, Uglanov, Burganin, and important members of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

<h3 id="e21">Mussolini: Bans Anti-British Propaganda; Regarding the Abyssinian Question, Britain and France Have Begun Negotiations <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources here, after British parliamentarians criticized Italy's policy towards Abyssinia, the attacks on Britain by zealous Italian patriots have caused Mussolini to intervene. Mussolini has banned Italian newspapers from making irresponsible anti-British propaganda, saying that newspapers that violate the order will be confiscated. Since the British three parties issued a joint declaration condemning Italy's actions in Abyssinia, newspapers here have launched major attacks, leading to tension in British-Italian relations. Although the diplomatic authorities of the two countries have made every effort to explain, they have not been effective. (National News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech to the Blackshirt comrades in Sassari today, indirectly attacking Britain, saying that so-called foreign public opinion is nothing more than ridiculous fantasies that can be burned with the enthusiasm of the Blackshirt comrades. This statement clearly refers to Britain's intention to interfere in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, but Italian newspapers have been warned by officials not to make critical remarks about Britain, and those who do not comply will have their newspapers confiscated. British newspapers attached great importance to Mussolini's speech on Saturday and Sunday. According to reports, when the Italian Prime Minister mentioned the Italian-Abyssinian dispute that day, he said that "they (referring to Britain)" have shown us that when the issue of creating or maintaining an empire arises, they do not consider world opinion. However, only one British newspaper published an editorial criticizing it. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government is currently holding secret negotiations with the countries concerned regarding the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, especially with the French government, to seek to take coordinated measures to protect European expatriates in Abyssinia, and is considering ordering all Caucasians to withdraw from Abyssinia if necessary. According to recent news from the capital of Abyssinia, it is generally believed that military action before the rainy season in Abyssinia is not impossible. Therefore, a conflict between Italy and Abyssinia from the end of July onwards may reach an acute stage. When the Council of the League of Nations discussed the Italian-Abyssinian dispute last month, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini expressed a willingness to compromise. Therefore, it is generally hoped that this spirit of compromise will continue to be maintained, so that Italy and Abyssinia can once turn hostility into friendship. However, concerns about Italian-Abyssinian relations are increasing day by day, and Italian newspapers' attacks on Britain have not stopped, which has made British public opinion very unhappy. Prime Minister Baldwin gave a speech in the Hemley Grand Hall last Saturday, in which he said, "A dictatorial government can take unexpected actions." This remark may be alluding to Italy. If so, then the European countries and the League of Nations today may encounter major experiences. (Havas dispatch of the 10th) Bucharest: This question of acting a comedy of Mussolini, very get audience's praise, but resides in this place Italy person look at of extremely indignation, therefore notify Italy diplomat authority, lodge a protest, today police service authority already grant it with cut real to ban.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the British-German naval talks, it is rumored that the British government has approved the German government's request to retain 35% of the British naval force, which is 400,000 tons of naval power. However, the British government conveyed the content of the talks to the Japanese government through Ambassador Matsudaira stationed in the UK on the 10th and sought their opinion. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will consult with the Navy Department and reply to the UK. However, the Japanese government intends to reserve its right to speak and will treat it with caution. The original text of the British government's notification is recorded below: "The British government has received an application from the German government, stating that it must retain 35% of the British naval force, which is 400,000 tons of naval power, etc. Therefore, it intends to consult with the governments of the countries concerned, namely Japan, the United States, France, and Italy, and then retain the final consent to the German government. What is the Japanese government's opinion on this matter? Please reply." (United Press dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The British-German naval talks have been temporarily suspended because the German representatives returned home for instructions. It is now known that these talks will continue to be held on Friday of this week. At that time, it is hoped that Britain and Germany can reach an agreement on the main points. According to well-informed sources, Germany no longer opposes the tonnage limit for each type of warship, so that Britain can still maintain its naval superiority in the North Sea. It is generally hoped that the German representative Ribbentrop can propose detailed methods for Germany's future shipbuilding in the next round of talks. Even if the negotiations are successful, the two sides will not sign an agreement. It is expected that Britain and Germany will jointly issue a communiqué, which is the same method as the preliminary naval talks between Britain, the United States, and Japan last year. It is also generally believed that Germany's shipbuilding program will not hinder the naval conference next year. (Havas dispatch of the 9th)</p>

<p>Belgian Capital: Minister of Defense Theunis recently delivered a speech in Mons, raising the issue of extending the period of military service and advocating increasing the number of existing troops. Belgian public opinion was shocked by this news. Cabinet member and Socialist leader Vandervelde has clearly expressed his opposition, saying that when the national unity cabinet was established, it declared that all issues related to military affairs and other issues contested by the parties should be maintained as they are. Therefore, Theunis should not raise the issue of extending military service. In addition, the Christian Democratic Party also opposes extending the period of military service. Because of the strong opposition from all parties, Theunis remained silent. As for Prime Minister de Broqueville, he acknowledged that the government should maintain the current military service system. However, it is generally believed that Theunis may formally raise this issue in Parliament in the near future. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Greek General Election; Government Party Has Won; Palace Refurbished in Preparation for Restoration <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Athens: According to the latest results of the Greek election, the government side has won a great victory. The Metaxas party only won five seats in the 300-seat parliament. This kind of crushing defeat is beyond the expectations of the general public. The government side won 287 seats, and the remaining seven seats were won by independents. It is estimated that supporters of the monarchy reached more than 100,000 votes. (National Press dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>Athens: According to the initial results of yesterday's Greek general election, the government party has obviously won a great victory. This is actually the prelude to holding a referendum to vote on the issue of restoration. According to the royalist party hosted by General Metaxas, they are willing to restore the monarchy immediately, while the government led by Tsaldaris believes that the future political system of Greece can be resolved according to public opinion after a referendum is held. Because of differing opinions on both sides, it promoted the general election. The republican party in the opposing position claimed to have won the support of 50% of the electoral districts, but did not participate in the election because of the recent failure of the Venizelos uprising. Yesterday, the voting was carried out all day long, and it was quite quiet, because the government prevented disturbances. At the same time, the summer villa of the Greek royal family in Tato, near Athens, and the former palace have been refurbished to prepare for the restoration of King George of Greece. According to reports, the King of Greece was released in March 1924, and his reign was less than two years. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek general election was held today without any accidents. The election results have not yet been announced, but it is generally believed that Venizelos' party will definitely suffer a fatal blow. The party members knew they would fail and decided not to participate in the election. Therefore, today's election is limited to the competition between Tsaldaris and Kondylis' government party and Metaxas' opposition party. But the political platforms of the two parties are actually similar. The difference lies in the strategies used by the two parties. Tsaldaris hopes to decide the restoration issue after the general election, while Metaxas' party hopes to decide the issue by today's election. It is said that if Metaxas' party has a chance of winning, it is tantamount to the people supporting the monarchy. If so, a general vote will be held soon after the election to decide the political system. (National News Agency dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The deposed King George II of Greece arrived here from London tonight. Recently, the theory that Greece will be restored is rampant, so the whereabouts of the deposed King is attracting general attention. (Havas dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris declared to a reporter from the Paris Evening News that the Greek National Assembly will meet on June 20 and will first discuss the issue of approving the various substitute laws and orders promulgated by the government. Only in mid-July will the issue of the national system be discussed. Therefore, a referendum to resolve the issue of the national system will be held only after political emotions have calmed down somewhat in October. Some people think that the issue of the national system may be raised when the representatives of the National Assembly are sworn in, because the royalists will refuse to swear an oath and will only express their willingness to swear an oath to the deposed king.

<h3 id="e27">Tunnel Excavation Completed in the Vosges Mountains of France; Four Railway Lines Built on the East and West Slopes; Facilitating Transportation between the Departments of Alsace and Lorraine <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) France's eastern border has the Vosges Mountains, which block traffic between the departments of Alsace and Lorraine. In recent years, the authorities have started to excavate a tunnel, connecting the city of Saint-Dié on the west side of the Vosges Mountains to the city of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines on the east side, which is 7 kilometers long. This project has now been completed. Before the department of Alsace was returned to France, there were only two railway lines, north and south, between the Alsace Plain on the eastern foot of the Vosges Mountains and the French department of Lorraine on the western foot, 125 kilometers apart. The north line goes from Paris to Strasbourg, passing through the Luneville Ridge, the city of Lunéville, and the city of Nancy. The south line starts from the city of Mulhouse, passing through the Belfort tunnel to reach Lyon. However, cities in the middle of the department of Alsace, such as Colmar and Barr, and the areas of Épinal and Saint-Dié on the western foot of the Vosges Mountains are not connected by railways. After the department of Alsace was returned to France in 1919, the authorities formulated a plan to tunnel through the east and west slopes of the Vosges Mountains and add four railway lines. The first line was built in April 1919 and completed in 1928, directly connecting the two cities of Strasbourg and Saint-Dié. A tunnel was excavated in the middle, with nine loops, reaching a height of 17 meters. After this line was completed, the transportation distance between the two cities has been reduced from 160 kilometers to 87 kilometers. The second line, which connects Saint-Dié and Sainte-Marie, will be completed soon. As for the other two lines, construction will begin soon. These two lines will connect the two cities of Colmar and Épinal, and the two cities of Remiremont and Mulhouse. Five tunnels will be excavated, one of which is more than 8 kilometers long. Eight loops will be built, reaching a height of 17 meters, and nine bridges will also need to be built. This project will take seven years to complete. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)</p>

<p>Argentina's Capital City After three years of fierce fighting between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Chaco region, peace is now in sight thanks to the mediation of neighboring countries Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. The measures proposed by the mediators to eliminate the possibility of continued warfare between the two countries have been accepted by the foreign ministers of Bolivia and Paraguay and submitted to their governments for approval. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th) This peace conference has received considerable support from the United States, and League of Nations officials are particularly eager for the Chaco War to end as soon as possible. A South American expert from the League of Nations Executive Council stated today that after the truce between the two countries, it would be difficult to reignite the conflict. They believe that during the truce period, the two countries will be able to resolve various difficult issues. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Public Communique Issued Upon Conclusion of Negotiations</p>
<p>Argentina's Capital City The Chaco Peace Conference has issued an official communique, stating that representatives from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and the foreign ministers of Bolivia and Paraguay have reached a peace agreement, stipulating various security measures, such as the demobilization of Bolivia and Paraguay and the demilitarization of the Chaco region, to prevent the recurrence of hostilities. In addition, the submission of the Chaco matter to arbitration was determined. After the conclusion of the negotiations, Brazilian Foreign Minister Macedo Soares issued a statement to the press, saying, "We have now achieved peace. Once accepted by the governments of Bolivia and Paraguay, the peace agreement will be signed here. The foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia are now gathered here, awaiting only the arrival of the foreign ministers of Peru and Chile." (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Draft Agreement Contains Four Items</p>
<p>Argentina's Capital City The Chaco Peace Conference reached a draft agreement yesterday, which was verbally accepted by the foreign ministers of Bolivia and Paraguay and is now awaiting approval from their governments before it can be signed. The draft agreement contains four items: (1) a twelve-day ceasefire on both sides, which can be extended upon expiration; (2) both sides will reduce their army personnel by 5,000 each and will not rearm; (3) an international military commission will demarcate and govern the neutral zone. As for the territorial issue of the Chaco region, which is the main cause of the dispute between the two countries, Bolivia and Paraguay will hold direct negotiations within the framework of the peace conference to seek a solution. If direct negotiations fail, the matter will be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for adjudication. This agreement will only take effect after it has been accepted by the governments of both parties and approved by their parliaments. The temporary end to the Bolivian-Paraguayan War after several years is indeed gratifying, but the dispute between the two countries cannot be considered to have been finally resolved. As long as the Chaco territorial issue disputed between the two countries is not resolved, the difficulties will remain. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Government leaders announced today that the Senate's debate on the Recovery Act will begin on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Senators Borah, Clark, and King are preparing to oppose the extension of the Act, believing that the Recovery Act could lead to the destruction of American antitrust laws. Senate leaders indicated today that during the debate, some will deliberately use delaying tactics to postpone the bill until next Sunday, as next Sunday is when the Recovery Act expires. They do not want any amendments before the expiration. However, there is no public opposition yet, and government leaders are also trying their best to prevent the opposition from developing to a public level. Borah's faction favors returning the original bill to the Senate Finance Committee for reconsideration and then presenting it to the floor for debate. If this is implemented, the bill will be slightly modified. However, government leaders oppose this move, demanding an immediate decision. Clark's faction favors no longer extending the Recovery Act and transferring all provisions of the Act to the Federal Trade Commission, allowing the industry to set its own rules and the Trade Commission to implement them.

<p>Mülhausen, France The National Congress of the Socialist Party continued its meeting at noon. The leader of the party's parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies, Foure, delivered a speech stating, "The results of the recent municipal council elections show that fascism has not disappeared, and reactionaries still intend to seize power by force. If the Paris riots of February 6th last year were to recur, if France were to betray its oath to the democratic constitution, and if French soldiers were to violate discipline and participate in fascist rebellions, then the strength of the proletariat in Paris and its suburbs would still be sufficient to extinguish the fascist offensive. Even if the enemy party colluded with the police and army to occupy Paris, we should still persevere and fight the fascist party. We have studied the tactics for when Paris is occupied. If the fascist party rebels one day, then all those who want to save the democratic republic should join our party and put forward the unified slogan: 'Stop Paris train traffic, cut off food supply, so that the enemy is bound hand and foot.' At this point, Socialist political leader Léon Blum spoke, demanding unanimous passage of the report on internal party discipline, saying, "Internal discipline and adjudication are necessary to maintain the life of a political party. We may one day participate in the revolution, as in the past. At that time, we French will kill each other and slaughter each other, unavoidably." Finally, the Congress passed the discipline report with a majority of 2,698 votes to 441 votes, with another 90 votes not participating. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e34">British Special Envoy Financial Expert Ross's Mission to China to Study the Possibility of International Loans The Trend of Chinese Currency Will Not Exceed Three Paths <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government has recently decided to send financial advisor Sir Ross to China in August to study China's financial situation. In recent months, the Chinese government has repeatedly held negotiations with the four countries of the banking consortium, Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, seeking to establish Chinese currency on the most sound basis so that large loans can be granted to China. The British government's decision to send Sir Ross to China this time is clearly the result of these lengthy negotiations. The initial loan negotiations with China were conducted by the United States, but the Sino-American loan encountered various difficulties and subsequently came to naught. At that time, the countries concerned recognized that clarifying the Chinese currency situation was a prerequisite for the loan. Therefore, it was proposed to convene a currency conference in Nanjing. After negotiations, the countries concerned believed that there was no need to convene a formal conference, so they canceled the proposal and instead decided to send representatives from each country to China to investigate the Chinese financial situation in conjunction with the embassies in China, so as to submit reports to their respective governments. In addition to Britain, the United States, and France, countries such as Japan and Italy also planned to send representatives to China. The candidates were originally intended to be selected by the central banks of the countries concerned, such as the Bank of France, the Bank of England, and the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. Now that Britain has appointed financial advisor Ross to visit China, it can be seen that the countries concerned have changed their policy, changing from having representatives from the Ministry of Finance to investigate China. Sir Ross is a senior official of the Ministry of Finance and has repeatedly represented Britain in various important financial and economic negotiations. Now that he has been ordered to visit China, it is not difficult to imagine that the British government attaches great importance to this move. Ross's investigation of Chinese finance will begin in August. The US silver policy is a major cause of China's currency difficulties. Therefore, after Ross arrives in China, he will thoroughly study this issue. The London financial community is now speculating that the trend of Chinese currency will not exceed three paths: first, to establish a link with gold through the mediation of the United States; second, to join the Sterling Area; and third, to maintain the silver standard and improve its application.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 186th Memorial Week at 8:00 am on the 10th, attended by Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Wu Jingheng, Chen Lifu, Chu Minyi, Deng Jiayan, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Huang Musong, Ji Liang, and all staff, totaling approximately 600 people. Wang Zhaoming presided, and Wu Jingheng reported, stating that China's current economic difficulties have reached an extreme point, and we must work hard to overcome them. Nowadays, the social atmosphere is that spending more money is considered extravagant, or it is considered respectful, so ordinary people are busy with socializing, gift-giving, and hosting, which is extremely costly. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek only serves four or five dishes when he hosts guests. Why don't we imitate him? We should stipulate details in the New Life Movement, and everyone should abide by them, so as to save this extravagant atmosphere. Of the results of world material civilization, I think 30% are useful, such as production machines, new agricultural implements, and running water. 30% are useless, such as luxury goods like high heels and electric perms. And the remaining 40% are the most useless and harmful to mankind, namely, lethal weapons such as guns and cannons. When we accept world material civilization, we should also know what to choose, buy what we should buy, and not buy what we shouldn't buy. We should develop our own production enterprises, not simply be salesmen of foreign goods. If we can be so hardworking and self-motivated, why worry about not being able to overcome this economic difficulty? After Wu Jingheng finished his speech, the meeting adjourned at 9:00 am. (Central News Agency Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Memorial Week at 10:00 am on the 10th, attended by Deng Jiayan, Lin Xiang, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various ministries and departments of the National Government, totaling approximately 400 people. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he delivered an impromptu report on the meaning of serving the people as a new morality in the world. He first explained in detail the meaning of a passage in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's final instructions at the Huanghuagang Memorial Meeting at Lingnan University in Guangzhou in the 13th year of the Republic (1924). Secondly, he said that people with intelligence and ability should serve the public. Our predecessors had excellent role models, such as Yu the Great, who passed his home three times without entering, Yi Yin, who took the world as his responsibility, Zhuge Liang, who personally handled everything, and Fan Zhongyan, who was the first to worry about the world's troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures. Other patriots and men of virtue sacrificing themselves for the benefit of the people are also common in history. However, under the autocratic system of the last two thousand years, monarchs regarded hiring talents as beneficial to themselves, and the public regarded being an official as an honor, forgetting the obligations of public servants, resulting in poor politics and national decline. Although a few figures in history knew the principle of serving the public, due to deeply ingrained habits, it was difficult to change. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely changed the political system and rebuilt the republic, so that the general public with knowledge could break old concepts and take service as their purpose. This is also a manifestation of the revolution. Thirdly, he said that in recent times, some people have abandoned the old morality and have no correct understanding of the new morality, resulting in decadent thoughts and inconsistent and divergent views. This is the most worrying and painful thing. If we can deeply remember the meaning of "everyone is responsible for the fate of the country" and cultivate a broad and resolute character to serve the country and society, that is the talent needed in modern times. Finally, he encouraged his colleagues to abide by the teachings, do their best to fulfill the responsibilities of political tutelage, relieve the suffering of the people, and lead the masses under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, dividing labor and cooperating to seek a way out for our country and nation, never forgetting to serve the public.

<h3 id="e36">Report on Abolishing Oppressive Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies Over the Past Year Released by the Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, released a report on the abolition of oppressive taxes and miscellaneous levies over the past year, stating that over the past year, the abolition of oppressive taxes and miscellaneous levies has reached more than 44 million yuan. However, this is only a temporary relief measure. The basic plan, such as budget determination and land tax consolidation, is in progress. Other matters, such as consolidating the deed tax, broker tax, business tax, and unified collection system, are of great importance and are being improved separately. It is also planned to open up new sources of tax revenue without disturbing the people, such as implementing income tax and inheritance tax. Modern fiscal policy is nothing more than developing the national economy and enriching national resources. The two cannot be neglected. The government must reduce oppressive taxes and miscellaneous levies to reduce the burden on the people, and the people should also strive to contribute to meet the needs of national finance. The national crisis is extremely serious today. Financial turmoil and urban panic have appeared one after another. Survival is at stake. Our country is based on agriculture, and farmers account for more than 80% of the population. Due to the increasing burden on farmers and rural bankruptcy, while we should seek relief for urban industry and commerce today, how can we forget the fundamental rural revitalization? Minister Kong Xiangxi has requested at the Fourth Plenary Session to reduce land tax surcharges to relieve rural areas and convened the National Financial Conference last year. How to understand the people's difficulties and enrich the country's resources in the future is not only the responsibility of those engaged in finance, but also the guidance and mutual assistance expected from the party and country's forerunners and the people's supervision.

<p>(Nanjing) Legal Advisor Baodao brought the opinions of the British and German merchant groups in Shanghai on the draft bankruptcy law to Nanjing on the morning of the 10th and presented them to the Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan. At the same time, National Government Legal Advisor Ascara also sent his opinions on the draft bankruptcy law from Paris to Nanjing. The Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan held another meeting on the 10th to review it. Chairman Fu Bingchang and Baodao also attended. The opinions raised by the foreign guests still considered that Articles 4 and 5 of the draft were inappropriate and advocated deleting them. Regarding Article 60, which states that bankruptcy may be declared upon the petition of a creditor or debtor, it should be clearly stipulated whether this petition can be made during the conciliation procedure. After research, the committee decided to retain Article 4, delete Article 5, and add "the petition may also be made during the conciliation procedure" to Article 60. The meeting adjourned at noon. A total of Articles 5, 58, and 105 were deleted, and two articles were added after Article 142, bringing the total number of articles to 159. The committee decided to conduct another review on the 11th before submitting it to the next week's plenary session. (Central News Agency Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In the past, the expenses of our foreign embassies and consulates were often in arrears due to financial difficulties. Some embassies even had to borrow money to maintain their operations. This situation has not been improved for more than two years. In the past two years, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been able to allocate funds to the embassies on time without any more arrears. However, the foreign debts owed by the embassies in the past cannot be denied. Over the years, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made great efforts to raise funds for the embassies and, in order to enhance international credibility, has also strictly implemented a policy of thrift, hoping to selectively consolidate the accumulated foreign debts. It is reported that the Ministry has gradually paid off the 161,000 francs owed by the embassy in the Netherlands to the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, the 50,000 francs owed by the embassy in Belgium to the Belgian Telegraph Bureau, and the more than 38,000 yuan owed by the embassy in Portugal to the Sino-Belgian Bank from the remaining expenses of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). If there is any surplus in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the consolidation will continue. (Special Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance stated that the people of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and five counties in the Xuzhou district of Jiangsu extract salt from the salty alkaline soil and sell it everywhere, encroaching on the sales of official salt. The salt affairs agencies have investigated and prohibited this, but the production area is vast and scattered, and smuggling is rampant. However, if the investigation and prohibition are carried out earnestly, it is necessary to dispatch more police officers for patrol, which will also incur some expenses. It seems that allowances should be given. The Ministry of Finance formulated a plan in September of last year. For counties that produce local salt, the local salt affairs agency should first refer to the average sales volume of official salt in the county over the past three years as a standard. Subsequently, if the county magistrate is effective in suppressing smuggling and can increase the sales of official salt by more than 20% compared to the average sales volume of the previous three years, the salt affairs agency in charge is allowed to extract 20% of the excess tax revenue from the county. If the increase in sales is more than 10% but less than 20%, it is allowed to extract 10% as a subsidy for the county government's public expenses for suppressing local salt. As for the amount of tax revenue to be extracted this year, it is planned to consolidate the cases and verify them after the end of the current year, and then supplement the budget. This plan was submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan for approval. On the 10th, the National Government approved the plan for record. (Special Telegram, 10th)</p>

Even if a small number of refugees enter sporadically, it is difficult to prevent them. Military and police agencies have increased patrols and are conducting secret investigations at water and land terminals and train stations, trying to prevent them from landing or getting off the train. As for the disaster victims from the surrounding villages and the beggars who come to Beijing to seek food, the military and police agencies will arrest them all, concentrate them, and then classify and organize them, forcing them to work.

<p>(Xuzhou) Xuzhou and Haizhou counties have not had a thorough rain for two months. The weather is severely dry and hot, close to 100 degrees. The scorching sun is like fire. The fields are cracked. Although the wheat has been harvested, the autumn seedlings are eagerly awaiting rain. Grain prices are gradually rising. Fires are frequent in urban and rural areas of various counties. Farmers in the countryside are praying for rain. (Central News Agency Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain in the city for more than a month. The farmland is all parched. Farmers in the countryside are running around in alarm, saying that a drought is about to form. Sun Lingwei, the district chief of Yanzi矶, has submitted a report to the municipal government, stating that the seedlings are about to wither.

<p>Embankments in Huizhou and Boluo Counties Collapse in Succession; Fields and Homes Submerged; Residents Flee the Flood and Go Without Food</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In Guangdong Province, before the summer Dragon Boat Festival, there were consecutive days of heavy rain. The East River channel is shallow and narrow, and the floodwaters rose sharply. In addition, mountain floods erupted in the upstream Longchuan and Heyuan counties. The river water was turbulent and torrential, and the downstream Huizhou and Boluo counties bore the brunt. Moreover, starting from the first day of this month, there were three days of continuous rain. The water level of the East River suddenly rose more than nine feet. The eastern and western tributaries of Huizhou flooded simultaneously. By the fourth day, the floodwaters were still gushing in, and the water level rose another three feet. In the confluence area of the county seat, the water was knee-deep. In the city of Huizhou Prefecture, the waters entered homes in Six Corner Pavilion, Xiushui Lake, Bell Tower Pavilion, Blacksmith Street, Ehu and other streets. Residents all took refuge on the upper floors. The areas of the West Gate of the county seat, Huangjiatang, Donggong Bridge, Tie Luhu, and Xiaputangxia outside the prefectural and county seat became a vast expanse of water. Boats were used for travel, and the ripening rice paddies and miscellaneous grains were all submerged. The harvest for this season is hopeless, and the impact has caused rice prices to soar more than twofold. The poor are all crying out in pain. Late at night on the second, the waters were particularly turbulent. The embankment of Hongteng Township in the Seventh District was breached by the raging current, with a gap of several dozen feet. Villagers inside the embankment were unable to escape in time, and dozens drowned. Countless houses collapsed. The floodwaters also affected nearby Aibei Township, and the villagers fled to the hills for refuge, sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind. At this time, when the old crop has been exhausted and the new one not yet harvested, many people are lamenting that they have no food. The terrain of Boluo County is also low-lying and located in the downstream basin of the East River. By the fourth day, the floodwaters had arrived, and all of the Shangshui Guan, Xiashui Guan, Da Xi Men, and Xiao Xi Men were submerged. The raging current was so rapid that small boats could not pass. Only the Da Dong Men and Xiao Dong Men could be used for travel by boat. The water level inside the city was higher than in Huizhou. On the fifth day, the waters completely flooded Lu Zu Lane, Xianji Street, Jiali Street, Tangbei Lane, and Houjie Hengjie, with the floodwaters reaching the eaves. If they rose by another foot, the buildings in that area would be submerged in the water. Micang Lane, Qiaotou Lane, Shigu Lane, and Huangwu Lane, which are located on higher ground, were also several feet deep in water. Dozens of villages and towns outside Boluo, such as Sucunwei, Baizuling, Erhewu, Licunwei, and Dalongwei have become a marsh. Dozens of feet of the levee collapsed in Qiankou of Shuixiang. More than a dozen floating corpses have been found in the river near Licun in the past few days. Many houses have collapsed nearby. Furthermore, on the third day, the houses of five residents near Shuikouwei in the Seventh District of Huizhou were washed away by the water, and several people drowned. In addition, boats sink on the river every day, and small boats do not dare to travel. Various highways in Huizhou, such as the Huishan, Huibo, Huizi, Huijia, and Huilong sections, have all been blocked by water, and traffic has been suspended. (June 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Shantou's Silver Shortage <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>All Industries and Businesses Are at a Standstill; Guangdong Province Will Take the Opportunity to Switch to the Dollar Standard</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The financial crisis in Shantou has become increasingly serious in recent days. Silver is soaring, paper money is falling, and prices are fluctuating as a result. Exchange rates are rising continuously in various ports, and the transportation and sale of import and export goods are severely affected. The general salaried class has suffered greatly, and the depth and breadth of the damage is causing widespread fear. Although the export of silver has been strictly prohibited and the customs has repeatedly made seizures, those who prohibit it prohibit it, and those who transport it transport it. The outflow of silver is increasing daily. According to a reporter's investigation, two months ago there were still more than five million silver dollars circulating in the market. Now, there are fewer than three million. The reasons are: 1. Since Shanghai banned the export of silver, Shantou's silver has been flowing out without flowing in, so it has decreased without increasing. 2. Since the silver supply in the market is extremely scarce, its price has naturally increased, and irredeemable local notes have fallen more and more. Therefore, those with large amounts of capital are hoarding silver, holding it tightly and refusing to release it in order to manipulate it for profit in the future. Therefore, credit is tightening. Due to these two major reasons, a fragmented situation has been formed. (At the end of last month, because the Shantou branch of the Provincial Bank exported a large amount of silver, the price of silver soared, rising to 1.3 yuan. For example, one silver dollar was equivalent to 1.3 yuan of guaranteed banknotes denominated in silver in Shantou. The price of small silver coins also increased with the price of silver. Every yuan of guaranteed banknotes was only worth 91 cents of small silver coins. After merchants protested, the Shantou branch temporarily suspended exporting silver, and the price of silver fell slightly as a result, falling to just over 1.2 yuan per yuan. On the 3rd of this month, a certain party bought silver again on a large scale. Those who owned silver seized the opportunity to hold on tightly, and the price of silver rose again from exhaustion, breaking an unprecedented record. On the 3rd, it rose to more than 1.31 yuan. On the morning of the 4th, it rose to more than 1.32 yuan, and the upward trend continues. It may rise to 1.4 yuan. Guaranteed paper and warehouse receipts for merchants are falling more and more due to the influence. On the 4th, every yuan was only equivalent to 90 cents of small silver coins. The public is suffering more and more. The overseas remittances that are sent back by the batch bureaus have no cash to pay, causing the family members of overseas Chinese in various villages, all industries, and businesses to be at a standstill. The market at the Dragon Boat Festival is increasingly depressed. Old debts and new accounts in the commercial world cannot be settled realistically due to the cold market. Everyone is living in order to prolong their lives. In the various counties and towns in Shantou, hundreds of stores closed down during the Dragon Boat Festival, and they have fallen into a very miserable situation. It is reported that Yang Dezhao, the representative of the First Army Group of Guangdong stationed in Nanjing, telegraphed to Ou Fangpu, the director of the Finance Department, on the 2nd, suggesting that the dollar standard be adopted as soon as possible because the current dollar has fallen and the price of small silver coins is equal to the dollar. This would make it possible to turn around the foreign trade of this province and foreign exchange would also be revitalized. The original text of the proposal has been agreed to by Director Ou. Ou submitted the telegram to the "Guangdong Economic Design Committee" for review and research. When the Design Committee considers it feasible, it will convene the silver industry in Guangzhou and Shantou to discuss how to change the system. It may be realized in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Most Starving People Eat Tree Bark and Grass Roots; Strong Ones Eat "Everyone's Share" and Loot Grain Carts</p>
<p>Shenyang News: Since the establishment of the puppet regime in the Northeast, there have been continuous wars and famines. The border counties of the Northeast have suffered from severe disasters last year, and are now feeling a shortage of food and money. Coupled with the current high food prices, the lives of the general population are unspeakably difficult. The tragic situation is unprecedented in recent years. Most starving people eat tree bark, grass roots, or chaff. Some go hungry all day without a single meal, and some even starve to death. There are also some strong and fierce starving people who gather in groups of dozens or hundreds and go to the homes of wealthy people in various villages to eat and drink, calling it eating "everyone's share." In addition, some starving people gather on the side of the road and wait for grain carts to pass by, then rob them. This kind of phenomenon exists in all counties. It is said that the puppet authorities intend to use violence to quell the unrest. It is also reported that the puppet Fengtian Provincial Office has sent people to various counties to investigate the population statistics and the production and consumption of grain. According to the report, of the twenty-eight counties in the puppet Fengtian Province, only nine can be self-sufficient. The remaining nineteen counties are mostly in a difficult situation in terms of people's food. Based on the calculation of the province's population and the amount of grain produced, it is estimated that there will be a huge shortage of 55,000 stone of food by the autumn harvest. Therefore, the puppet Fengtian Provincial Office is also deeply worried. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

Guangdong advocates freedom of speech and has established a Southwest Publications Editorial Review Committee. The committee's review is very strict and conscientious. Six major newspapers and three small newspapers are published in Shantou every day. They are registered with the Southwest beforehand and published under the supervision of the city's Party headquarters. After the inspection, very few articles or small reviews can be published, and the news on each page is mostly the same. Now, the Southwest Editorial Review Committee has re-revised the regulations on bans and has set a new standard, which has been communicated by the executive department to the Party and government organs for strict implementation. If any of the following are violated, the entire piece will be deleted:</p>

<p>Zhu Huzhen of Qiancun, Xinbin South, Fengjing, has five sons and runs a pharmacy. His second son, Qinbo, was suspected of a certain crime and was taken by special envoys Chen Zhihe and Min Xiaozhang, along with informant Chen Yucai, to arrest him. Zhu Qinbo was just about to go somewhere when the special envoys showed their guns and ordered him not to escape. Just then, his father, Huzhen, crossed in front of him, and the gun went off somehow, hitting him in the throat and killing him instantly. The deceased's sons rushed forward to fight desperately. When the villagers saw someone being shot and killed, the crowd rioted and surrounded the officers, beating them in the head and face. They were then taken back to the company headquarters by the thirty-eighth foreign bridge gendarmerie and transferred to the county government. Zhu Qinbo was also taken to Songjiang temporarily and detained at the water patrol team headquarters. The injured special envoys have been examined by the prosecutor's office and are now being treated at Songjiang Hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Suzhou: Dispute over Lake Encroachment by Migrant Workers <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Over ten thousand acres of lake fields in East Tai Lake have been enclosed by embankments built by thousands of migrant workers. This obstructs the water conservancy and farming of the counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiangyin. Following strenuous appeals by the people's official offices of Wujiang and Wuxian counties, the provincial government convened a meeting and resolved to demolish the encroaching embankments. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission also sent personnel to conduct an on-site survey, which confirmed the necessity of demolition. The details of these events have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that on the morning of the 9th, the county government of Wuxian dispatched a security team led by Deputy Battalion Commander Nie, comprising over a hundred security personnel, who, together with District Chief Jin of the Fifth District, supervised over two thousand farmers to demolish the embankments built by the Xingu Jiawu Gongcheng Company. By 4 PM, three or four *li* of embankments had been removed. At 5 PM, over a hundred migrant workers who had enclosed fields attempted to cause trouble for the local villagers but were dispersed by the security team. Simultaneously, three individuals claiming to be representatives of the migrant workers arrived at the Fifth District Public Office demanding a halt to the demolition in order to safeguard the migrant workers' livelihoods. Their demands were rejected, and they departed. According to Deputy Battalion Commander Nie, by dusk, over three thousand migrant workers, predominantly from Shandong province, had gathered at Xingu Jiawu, apparently holding a meeting, claiming that the demolition was cutting off their livelihoods and threatening to fight to the death if the demolition continued on the 10th. Deputy Battalion Commander Nie, in addition to maintaining strict vigilance and continuing to investigate the movements of the migrant workers, reported the situation to the Wuxian County Magistrate via long-distance telephone, requesting instructions. Upon receiving the report, the Wuxian County Magistrate immediately boarded a steamboat and traveled overnight to direct the operation, arriving in Hengjing Town at 10 AM yesterday (the 10th). After resting at the District Public Office, he led the security team to Maoqi Port at 6 AM yesterday (the 10th) to direct the operation from close range. Meanwhile, Deputy Battalion Commander Nie, together with District Chief Jin, led three thousand farmers, under the strict protection of the security team, to continue the demolition at [time] AM yesterday (the 10th). Xu, the Wujiang County Magistrate, also dispatched Zheng, the Public Security Bureau Chief, to lead a team to assist in the operation. At 1 PM, this reporter inquired with the Fifth District Public Office in Hengjing via long-distance telephone and was informed that a report had been received at noon that a conflict had broken out between villagers and migrant workers near Nanku because the migrant workers were resisting the demolition. Several villagers had been injured by the migrant workers. The District Public Office had dispatched personnel to conduct an on-site investigation, but no large-scale conflict had yet occurred. As for the demolition, all encroaching embankments within the jurisdiction of Wuxian County have been completely removed. However, the demolition in Wujiang County will be carried out after receiving provincial orders. It is reported that these migrant worker enclosures are organized into eight companies, forming a very tight-knit organization employing over eight thousand migrant workers. Due to the proximity to Tai Lake and the large number of migrant workers, investigations are proving difficult. It is also heard that since the construction of the enclosures began a year ago, there are powerful figures backing them, such as a Mr. Yang from Wujiang and a Mr. Qian from Wuxian, who are said to be the bosses behind the migrant workers.</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance, to implement its policy of supporting industry and commerce, allocated national treasury bills worth 20 million yuan as collateral for industrial and commercial loans. These bills have now been deposited in the Central Bank. Cai Zengji and eleven others are scheduled to meet within days to discuss and issue management regulations. Yesterday, various money houses held a managers' meeting to discuss the issue of public debt mortgages. Xin Xin News Agency reporters investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>National Treasury Bills Deposited in Central Bank</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has allocated national treasury bills worth 20 million yuan as a second guarantee for relieving industrial and commercial loans, entrusting them to Cai Zengji and eleven others for management. It has also issued official letters to the banking and money house guilds, as well as the Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, instructing them to comply. Xin Xin News Agency reporters learned yesterday from the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office that the 20 million yuan in national treasury bills were deposited in the Central Bank yesterday, awaiting collection and management by Cai Zengji and others.</p>
<p>Meeting Convened for Collection and Management</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has issued official documents to Cai Zengji, Wu Xingya, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Guangfu, Wang Yansong, Qin Runqing, Bei Songsun, Xi Demao, Zhang Peishen, Yu Zuoting, and eleven others, entrusting them with the management of the national treasury bills. Xin Xin News Agency reporters learned yesterday that Cai Zengji, Director of the Finance Bureau, plans to convene a meeting of the committee within days to discuss the collection of the national treasury bills and management methods. As for future loan disbursement matters, it remains to be decided whether this will be handled by the committee managing the bills or by another committee formed by the banking, money house guilds and the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Bank of Communications after the management committee has collected the bills.</p>
<p>Song Zi Liang Appointed as Manager</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has allocated national treasury bills worth 20 million yuan as a second guarantee for relieving industrial and commercial loans. In addition to appointing Cai Zengji and eleven others to manage the bills, it has now additionally appointed Song Zi Liang, General Manager of the China National Products Bank, as a manager, bringing the total number to twelve. This is because Mr. Song is proficient in economics and enjoys a high reputation in the Shanghai business community. The authorities have therefore added him as a manager, and the appointment letter was sent out last night.</p>
<p>National Products Groups Urge Completion of Forms</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that the Shanghai National Products Promotion League Committee sent letters yesterday to the National Products Factory Union, the Mechanized National Products Factory Union, the China National Products Maintenance Association, and the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association.

Vice Minister Xu agreed to allocate funds from the Ministry as a second guarantee and informed the banking syndicate to follow the ten principles of loan disbursement and implement the loan of 15 million yuan against collateral. The survey forms previously issued by the League to member factories are still outstanding from a small number of factories. Please inform your member factories to complete and return the forms to the League within three days so that they can be forwarded to the banking syndicate for review.</p>

<p>Import of Chinese Medicinal Wine Banned from Next Month; Dutch Merchant Ships to Stop Hiring Chinese Staff Next Year</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that the anti-Chinese wave in Southeast Asia has continued to this day and is showing signs of further expansion. Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and the American colonies have promulgated various regulations to oppress overseas Chinese, one after another, seemingly without end. According to reliable sources from the overseas Chinese community, the Dutch East Indies is treating overseas Chinese with increasing severity. Shen Shi News Agency reporters have compiled the details as follows:</p>
<p>Import of Chinese Medicinal Wine Banned from Next Month</p>
<p>The annual import of Chinese medicinal wine into Java reaches 1.5 million Dutch guilders. Because overseas Chinese have a strong sense of patriotism, they believe that Chinese medicinal wine is more effective than foreign medicinal wine and is also cheaper, so it is favored by overseas Chinese. The Dutch government has therefore issued an order stating that Chinese medicinal wine does not meet hygiene standards and will be banned from import from July 1st, forcing overseas Chinese to buy foreign goods. This matter should be noted by Chinese people.</p>
<p>Expelling Teachers from Registered Schools</p>
<p>Although the Java government is not currently expelling people without legal basis, the harshness of its regulations makes it extremely difficult for overseas Chinese to bear. The abuse of the intellectual community is particularly unbearable. The most important measure is to prevent overseas Chinese schools from registering with the Chinese Ministry of Education. The reason given is that after a school is registered, it becomes involved in politics, which is contrary to the Java government's principle of "non-involvement in politics." Teachers from registered schools are therefore subject to deportation.</p>
<p>Dutch Merchant Ships to Stop Using Chinese Staff</p>
<p>Dutch ships will stop hiring Chinese crew members from January 1st next year due to the Labor Party's opposition to the government's employment of Chinese crew members. Each Dutch ship traveling to ports in the Far East employs fifty to sixty Chinese staff members. If this is implemented next year, Chinese crew members will face unemployment. Kong instructed on the Ming Hua Bank matter</p>

<h3 id="e112">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Develops Upriver Shipping; Builds Three Fast Upstream Vessels <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Special Beijing-Hankou Train May Not Materialize</p>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Emei vessel accident, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have not had vessels dispatched for service, abandoning the shipping industry and causing enormous losses. General Manager Liu Hongsheng has proposed building new fast upstream vessels to develop the upper Yangtze River route. The cost of shipbuilding is planned to be covered by using the remaining funds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to purchase materials, with Shanghai shipyards undertaking the construction. Measures have been drafted, and bidding for construction is underway. At the same time, the company is planning to develop the supervisory board for upper Yangtze River shipping operations, and the business department has sent personnel to the upper reaches for investigation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection of Sichuan Province</p>
<p>Li Yunliang, Chief Auditor of the Supervisory Board, and Wang Jixian of the Operations Department's branch office, went from Shanghai to Hankou under the guise of inspection to investigate the shipping conditions on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and then transferred to various ports such as Shashi, Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing. This trip will examine the entire shipping industry of the upper Yangtze River, laying the groundwork for the company's overall plan to develop shipping and restore the Sichuan River route.</p>
<p>Adding Three Vessels</p>
<p>Currently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company only has one vessel, the Kuaili, on the upper Yangtze River, and only two other vessels are rented. Therefore, adding fast diesel vessels to the upper Yangtze River is the most urgent issue in terms of business. Liu Hongsheng has planned to use some of the remaining funds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to build three vessels. Each vessel will be approximately 300 feet long, with a draft of approximately 8 feet, a carrying capacity of 500 tons, and a speed of 14 nautical miles per hour. They will use diesel engines for fuel, which are cost-effective and fast. The interior of the vessels will be beautifully decorated. The materials will be purchased from England and then constructed by Shanghai shipyards.</p>
<p>Bidding Situation</p>
<p>At the time of bidding for the construction of these three vessels, the Jiangnan Shipyard and the Great China Machinery Factory submitted bids. During the bidding process, the Great China shipyard's price was lower, requiring 209,000 yuan per vessel based on a length of 300 feet. However, after the bid, the Great China shipyard sent a letter to the company stating that it was necessary to increase the length of the vessel to suit all aspects, and the cost per vessel would be above 220,000 yuan. The company is still discussing this matter because its price is not cheaper than the Jiangnan Shipyard. Once a decision is made, the construction will be commissioned.</p>
<p>Beijing-Hankou Fast Vessel</p>
<p>Mr. Qian of the Malkang Foreign Firm in this city petitioned Chairman Chiang, requesting a loan of 1.4 million yuan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to specially build two fast Yangtze River vessels to operate exclusively on the Beijing-Hankou route. The current two-day and night journey from Nanjing to Hankou would be shortened to arrival by midnight that day with this special fast vessel, departing in the morning and arriving in the evening, definitely profitable. Chairman Chiang specially assigned this case to two departments, ordering the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to reply. The company has replied to the Ministry, stating that the Emei vessel was requested by the Hubei Construction Department last year to open a Beijing-Hankou fast service, shortening the 388 nautical mile journey between Beijing and Hankou to 16 hours. Vessels traveling this route would have to travel at 24 nautical miles per hour, otherwise it would not be possible. If a vessel traveling at 24 nautical miles per hour were to burn coal, a regular vessel burning one ton of coal per hour would require this fast vessel to burn nine tons. This item alone would increase the coal price eightfold, resulting in no profit and only losses. This is one reason. If such a fast vessel were to travel the Yangtze River every day like a destroyer, not only would the vessel be dangerous, but the riverbanks on both sides would be eroded and damaged, causing even greater harm and no benefit.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Ma Yinchu Discusses the Significance of Restricting Foreign Insurance Industry <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Capital Outflow and Comprador Crimes Cannot Be Denied; Past History is Terrifying and Must Be Taken Seriously</p>
<p>Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee, recently completed the Insurance Law for the Committee. Regarding brokers of foreign insurance companies, they must obtain a license from the Ministry of Industry to operate and restrict certain business locations. He made the following remarks to Xin Sheng News Agency reporters: "Article 19 of the Insurance Law states that insurance brokers and notaries may not conduct business without registering with the Ministry of Industry and obtaining a license. Article 20 states that brokers of foreign companies who have obtained a license in accordance with the preceding article are limited in their business scope to treaty ports and may not entrust others to operate or introduce insurance business on their behalf in the interior. Article 21 states that brokers and notaries may not operate or introduce insurance business for insurance companies that have not been approved by the competent authority." These three regulations require brokers of foreign insurance companies in China to register with the Ministry of Industry and obtain a license to operate. This is not to discriminate against or abuse brokers in particular, but rather to take special care due to the terrors of the past. In the past, countless funds from China have been plundered by foreigners. The reason is entirely due to the sins committed by the Chinese themselves. For example, foreign firms handle imports and make a lot of money, entirely through the introduction of compradores. Without compradores, foreigners would be ignorant of the situation in the Chinese interior and would have difficulty operating commercially. Today, domestic goods are flooded with foreign goods, and domestic goods have no place to stand. Can we deny the crimes of the compradores? This is one thing. The Savings Society of the World, even if it only operated in the concessions, would not have absorbed as much capital from our country as it does today, and the crimes it has committed would not be as deep as they are today. But now there are branches of the Society everywhere in the interior, and all of them are operated by Chinese, concentrating all the capital of the interior in the Shanghai concessions. The investment in Shanghai real estate alone is 20 million yuan. Now that Shanghai land prices have fallen by 80-90%, the Society's investment in real estate has lost 17-18 million yuan, resulting in today's panic and making hundreds of thousands of our depositors bewildered. Who is responsible for this? This is another thing. If all the funds that have been scraped away from our country in the past by foreign commercial banks and the Savings Society of the World were to be used for domestic construction, would it not only reduce the oppression of foreign countries on domestic industries, but also be sufficient to strengthen the resistance to the oppression of foreigners? How different are the advantages and disadvantages? Thinking of this, how can one not sigh?"</p>

<p>Provincial Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Offset Each Other, Construction Progresses. Yesterday, He Visited Huang Fu, Ye Zuotang, Gu Yigu, etc.</p>
<p>Xu Fu, member of the Fujian Provincial Government and Director of the Finance Department, arrived in Shanghai from Fujian the day before yesterday and stayed at a friend's residence. Yesterday morning, he visited Ye Zuotang, General Manager of Siming Bank, and Gu Yigu, General Manager of the Bank of Communications. At 4 p.m., he visited Huang Fu, Chairman of the Pingzheng Commission, who was residing in Shanghai. According to Xu, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the financial situation in Fujian has been stable since the reorganization. Last year, public bonds were issued to make up for the deficit, and this year, things have been smooth. Revenue and expenditure are balanced; although there is no surplus, fortunately, there is no deficit. Operating expenses have been gradually increased, so construction projects have progressed. The current financial situation in Fujian is also extremely peaceful. The silver and money industries are very stable, and there have been no instances of empty accounts or bankruptcies. Xu (referring to himself) is going to Nanjing this time to report to the Legislative Yuan and discuss matters. He is scheduled to enter Nanjing today or tomorrow and report on the financial situation of Fujian Province to Finance Minister Kong. He will stay in Nanjing for about three or four days and then return to Shanghai, taking a flight back to Fujian. Today's visits to Ye and Gu and Chairman Huang were not for any particular mission or negotiation. Since they are all old friends, he made a point of visiting them while passing through Shanghai.</p>

<p>Donations from the Paint Industry are Enthusiastically Solicited</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team Office of the Chinese Aviation Association began its second solicitation campaign, it has relied deeply on the enthusiastic support of all sectors of the city, and the results have been excellent. Ma Shangjie, Chairman of the West Shanghai Paint Industry Association, is the captain of solicitation team 305 and is working very hard in the solicitation effort. He convened a meeting of fellow industry members a month ago to discuss the direction of the campaign, as previously reported. It is reported that Captain Ma has already raised $9.80 in donations and yesterday sent someone to the team leader's office to hand over the donations for counting. At the same time, he is still urging the committee members to solicit donations from fellow industry members. Also, Shi Daocun, vice-captain of teams 6 and 7, submitted 60 yuan in membership fees collected, which shows the general enthusiasm of the solicitation teams working hard and being patriotic. Since the Preparatory Committee Office for the Aviation National Salvation Aircraft Model Exhibition sought aircraft models, photographs, films, publications, etc. from various aviation organizations, foreign firms, and railway bureaus, etc., the submissions from all parties have been very enthusiastic, as previously reported.

Now, the replies from all parties have indicated their approval. At the same time, the Preparatory Office originally planned to convene the first inaugural dinner on the 16th, but because of insufficient time to connect with the Municipal Party Department, it decided to postpone it to 2 p.m. on the 23rd, to be held in the Grand Ballroom on the 7th floor of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, and invited leaders from all walks of life. The Preparatory Office has been officially renamed the Provisional Preparatory Office of All Circles in Shanghai for the Establishment of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.

<p>From August 1st of this year, Children's Year will be uniformly held throughout China, as stipulated and promulgated by the government. A group of progressive people in Shanghai's educational circles believe that promoting parental education is a crucial key to promoting children's happiness. Therefore, in May, they began to organize the Parental Education Research Association and held the inaugural meeting of the Parental Education Research Association at Zhao's residence in Wuxianfang, Disiwei Road, last night, which attracted general attention from society. The initiators of the association are Zhao Chuanjia, General Secretary of the East China Education Association; Chen Zhengfan, Director of the China Children's Welfare Association; Hu Zuyin, Principal of Jingzhou Road Elementary School, Shanghai Municipal Council; Zhou Junshang, Commissioner of the Municipal Education Bureau; and others. The method is to gather ten young couples to meet on the first Wednesday afternoon of each month to discuss various practical parenting issues, use the Modern Parents Monthly as a forum for expression, and report the results of their research to the public at any time, in order to gather ideas, stimulate enthusiastic discussion, generate practical actions, and achieve the practical effect of promoting children's happiness. In addition to holding meetings and discussions, the association also plans to visit exemplary families in various places, observe visits, study gains and losses, and use them as references for organizing exemplary families. On the evening of the inaugural meeting, the attendees were Tao Shaoyuan, professor of Guanghua University Affiliated Middle School, and Ms. Jia Yi; Ge Liting, Principal of the Northern District Elementary School, Shanghai Municipal Council, and Ms. Gu Jingren; Guo Daxiong, Director of the Shanghai Poor Children's Asylum, and Ms. Zhang Xiaoming; Mei Jinliang, editor of the Shizhao Newspaper, and Ms. Li Jingde; Zhou Junshang, Commissioner of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Ms. Ye Hua, Principal of Songxue Elementary School; Hu Zuyin, Principal of Jingzhou Road Elementary School, Shanghai Municipal Council, and Ms. Zhu Duanfang; Zhao Chuanjia, General Secretary of the East China Education Association, and Ms. Zhang Lijin; Chen Zhengfan, Director of the China Children's Welfare Association, and Tao Shuwen, Director of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Asylum; and others.

<h3 id="e128">Record of the Memorial Service for Mr. Yang Dunfu <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>June 9th was the day for holding the memorial service for Mr. Yang Dunfu, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Bank. The meeting was held at 10 a.m., and many people attended. After the meeting began, Mrs. Pan Guangjiong first played a dirge, followed by Mr. Zhuang Dezhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Bank, who reported on the purpose of the memorial service. All the guests then bowed to the portrait. The chairman reported on the deceased's life, saying that he had known the deceased for more than 20 years and had been colleagues for 18 years. He had no guile, worried about others' worries, and was anxious about others' anxieties. He firmly adhered to the principle of service and ensured that everyone was satisfied. He was also enthusiastic about education. Now, it is planned to establish a Dunfu Elementary School in Jiangning to continue his legacy and leave a lasting memory. Then, Mr. Kong Yongzhi, Minister of Finance, delivered a speech, saying that he had known the deceased for more than 20 years through the introduction of Mr. Chen Guangfu. Later, we founded the Shanghai Bank, and we felt that to become a modern commercial bank that could truly serve society, we needed talent. Therefore, we invited the deceased to be the deputy manager. Since then, our friendship has grown day by day. We observed his words and deeds, and he not only practiced what he preached but was also extremely amiable and kind to everyone, and everyone was happy to be close to him. Today, the most important things in life are to take the five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness as the foundation of one's life. The deceased can be said to possess all five virtues. Treating people with kindness is called benevolence; not letting down friends is called righteousness. As for propriety, the deceased has always maintained the demeanor of a gentleman in the past 20 years. He was able to assist Mr. Chen Guangfu and his colleagues at the Shanghai Bank in developing the bank's business to the extent that it has achieved today, which is called wisdom. The Shanghai Bank's reputation has long been known, and those who have dealt with the deceased have praised his outstanding reputation, which is called trustworthiness. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a country. The most dangerous thing for China is not poverty but the failure to establish the four pillars. Today, we commemorate the deceased and establish a school for him to cultivate future generations, not only to cultivate their knowledge but also to cultivate future generations who possess the spirit of the deceased. The deceased is gone, but may his personality and morality be continued and remain forever between heaven and earth. This is the meaning of today's memorial service. Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications; Song Ziliang, General Manager of the China National Goods Bank; Zhang Weiru, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange; and Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association, also delivered speeches, expressing their extreme admiration for the deceased. Finally, the family members came out to express their gratitude, and the ceremony concluded at around 12 o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Heavy Rainstorm Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Fields and Land Were Moistened and Refreshed, and the Farmers Were All Delighted</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather in this port has been very dry, and the fields and land have cracked, which has greatly affected crops such as cotton seedlings. At this busy farming season, the villagers especially yearn for rain. If there is no timely rain, it will inevitably become another drought. Although the heat has been high in recent days, it still feels cool at night. Yesterday morning, the room felt unusually stuffy. After 10 o'clock, the sky became cloudy and foggy, and the sunlight was completely obscured. From 1:45 p.m., thunder rumbled, and raindrops as large as fists (or hail) poured down heavily. The momentum was very fierce. After about two hours, the raindrops gradually stopped. After 4 o'clock, the rain cleared and the sun came out, and the heat suddenly dissipated, turning into a cool and refreshing atmosphere. According to the villagers, the rainfall was about an inch. Although it was not very heavy, the fields and land were moistened and refreshed. Money cannot buy timely rain, so the villagers were all delighted.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Student National Goods Year: Zhenru District Exhibition <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Opened Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Zhenru District Student National Goods Exhibition, sponsored by the Student National Goods Year Promotion Association, opened at Jinan University at 10 a.m. yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Shen Pengfei of Jinan University (representing Zhai Junqian), Pan Gongzhan of the Education Bureau (representing Yang Weiyu), and Yang Weiyu, Chen Zhongfu, Lou Ziming, Cao Zhigong, and teachers and students representatives from elementary schools such as Shiyan, Guanlong, Zhenru, and Zhangcai, totaling more than 400 people. Yang Weiyu, Chen Zhongfu, Lou Ziming, and others formed the presidium. The exhibits were displayed on the second floor of Zhiyuan Hall.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the ceremony, Lou Ziming first reported that the purpose of the Student National Goods Year Promotion Association holding this Student National Goods Exhibition today is to complete the mission of promoting national goods and to save the country from its current crisis. Since the Student National Goods Year began soliciting members on June 1, progress has been slow due to the summer examinations in various schools. The progress of soliciting members has been hindered, resulting in poor results. The board of directors originally set the membership fee for each student member at 3 jiao, and the badge at 5 fen. Recently, it was deemed inappropriate, so it was changed to each person soliciting at least one member in order to enhance the strength of promoting national goods. Today's opening is intended to encourage attendees to promote it, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Yang Weiyu's Speech: Then, Yang Weiyu gave a speech, saying that leaders from all walks of life in the city, because the country was in great danger after the September 18th Incident, and the scars of the January 28th Incident have not been eliminated, have launched various initiatives to promote national goods. At the same time, in view of the fact that students' daily necessities are mostly foreign goods, this year was designated as the Student National Goods Year. In the past, imports of paper products reached more than 42 million yuan annually, and cotton yarn, considering only Japanese goods, also reached more than 20 million yuan. Japanese fish products also reached more than 2.9 million yuan. These three items alone are a very large number. Some people say that China has vast land and abundant resources, but because Chinese people love to use foreign goods, domestic industries are declining day by day. Students are outstanding members of society. I hope young people will rise up to promote them in order to strengthen the country. Finally, Zhai Junqian's speech was omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Lake Society Resolutions: Prohibition of Gangsters Collecting Debts <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Based on the Proposal of Committee Member Yu Zhongxian, Request the Six Counties Governments to Issue a Notice for Prohibition</p>
<p>The Lake Society held its 11th Members' Congress on the 9th. Yu Zhongxian, a member of the society, submitted a proposal to the congress to discuss the issue of banning vagrants in the six counties from collecting old debts for stores on a contract basis. With the joint signatures of Shen Tianxin, Pan Gongzhan, Yan Jun, Shen Jiesheng, Ling Songru, Tang Chongshi, etc., the congress resolved to hand it over to the Executive Committee for handling. The original text of the proposal is excerpted below: A letter is sent to the six county governments, requesting strict prohibition of vagrants who act as debt collectors for stores, disturbing the villagers. No debts, no stores is a common rule for transactions in inland cities and villages. In recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the commercial market has declined. Store credit has been tightened. The merchants demand payment of old debts due to frequent famines and disasters, and the livelihood of farmers is on the verge of collapse. They don’t even have congee to eat, so how can they repay their debts? The stores do not remember the profits they have made in the past and entrust debt collection to the vagrants. These vagrants have no morals and are like wolves and tigers with ledgers in hand. They go to the villages to collect debts by intimidating, cheating, and deceiving. The villagers, fearing their power, sell their wives and children, and sell their houses and utensils to repay old debts. Suppose they earn a little after the silkworm season and the autumn harvest. In that case, they spend the entire year's income on redeeming property in pawnshops to pay debts. How can they have the surplus power to pay off these old debts? The disturbance caused by the vagrants collecting old debts is even worse than the officials collecting old taxes. As evidenced by the recent case in April in Xinshi Town, Deqing County, a vagrant was not successful in collecting debts. Later, when he met a villager in the town, he gathered a crowd to beat him to death in the downtown area. I hereby propose to the Congress to write a letter to the governments of the six counties to issue notices to strictly prohibit stores entrusting vagrants to collect old debts, disturbing the villagers, and to strictly investigate and arrest vagrants who collect debts and bring them to justice in order to pacify the farmers and maintain local security. Is this appropriate? Please vote.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Jian De Bank Case: Strict Interrogation of Chai Chuangui <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Chai was a Director and General Manager. The Judge's Interrogation of Various Charges was Extremely Strict.</p>
<p>The Jian De Bank went bankrupt. The directors, supervisors, and general manager of the bank, Chai Chuangui, etc., were sued by 14 creditors, including Wei Haijiang, on charges of fraud and embezzlement. The Second Special District Local Court appointed an accountant to audit the relevant accounts. After the audit was completed and reported to the court, Judge Liu Yugui scheduled a formal hearing yesterday afternoon. Of the 11 defendants, only Chen Xifu, Ou Jiancheng, and Zheng Huaigu were absent. The rest, including Chai Chuangui, Chai Yousheng, Tu Kaizheng, Li Jingwei, Yan Ziyu, Xie Keming, and Ma Suizhi, all surrendered themselves, which was more than the number who attended the previous hearings. Judge Liu first inquired about the periods during which each defendant served as chairman, director, supervisor, and general manager. Because Chai Chuangui served as general manager in the name of a director, his duties were heavier, and he must have a deep and detailed understanding of the bank's founding process, the amount of stock fraud, the registration procedures, the business situation, the types of debts, and the bankruptcy situation. Therefore, he was questioned repeatedly. According to Chai, the bank's capital was only 100,000 yuan in 1928. The following year, it was proposed to increase it to 500,000 yuan, and it was not until 1933 that it was expanded to 1 million yuan, but only 500,000 yuan was collected. When registering with the ministry, the amount of stock subscriptions was certified by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Ministry of Finance did not send personnel to verify the capital. After registration, no further shares were raised. As for the accountant's audit report, it stated that by September 25, 1933, the capital actually collected was only more than 250,000 yuan. Since it was based on an audit of the accounts, it should not be mistaken. The court immediately asked that the report also stated that more than 240,000 yuan of stock subscriptions were collected within three days after September 25, totaling 500,000 yuan. However, this subsequent collection of funds was immediately released. What kind of loan was it? Because the accountant could not investigate, you should explain it clearly. Chai claimed that he did not authorize the loan and could not explain it. The court believed that Chai was the general manager, and how could he claim ignorance of such large sums of money coming in and out? Therefore, he was questioned repeatedly. He was also questioned about the procedures that the bank should have followed when shareholders Liang Yaoji, Zhao Ziji, etc., sold their shares and the audit report stated that there were signs of alteration in the bank's accounts. The hearing continued until dusk before it was adjourned. Further verification is needed in the future.</p>

<p>His Foolishness is Unsurpassed. Even in Death, What is the Point?</p>
<p>Kan Mengxiong, from Heji, Anhui, is 25 years old and currently works as a servant at Wang Ji's residence at 92 Huayuanfang, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession. Wang works as a secretary at the Shanghai Security Office. Kan's mother died early. He has been working at Wang's home for nine years. He is usually foolish and honest. Chen Zhuofu, from Hubei, lives at No. 8 in the same alley. Chen used to be a commissioner somewhere. He has recently been unemployed and is waiting for a job in Shanghai. His family employs a young maid named A Jin from Wuxi, who is 18 years old. Although she is a village girl, she is somewhat attractive and dresses simply. Kan saw her and developed admiration for her. He joked with her in every possible way, hoping to fulfill his wishes. However, A Jin was pure and chaste and refused him sternly. Kan suffered from unrequited love and often muttered to himself, vowing to marry A Jin. If he could not achieve his goal, he would no longer live. He pestered the girl incessantly. After the girl told her master, Kan was reprimanded and not allowed to go out. Unexpectedly, he suddenly had a suicidal thought. He bought a package of raw opium and went to the girl's place, forcing her to commit suicide with him, hoping to be united in love in the afterlife. The girl snatched the opium from him and told her master, Wang Ji. Wang hated Kan for not repenting and fired him, giving him wages and travel expenses and telling him to go home quickly and find another job. After getting the money, he went out to prostitute and squander the money. After spending all the money, he thought that he had failed to win the girl's love and had lost his job. He had made a mess of things. He was not only ashamed to face people but also had no face to go home to see his brother and sister-in-law. He had the idea of committing suicide again. He pawned his clothes and bought one yuan of raw opium. At 9:30 p.m. on the 8th, he opened room number one at the Shunxing Inn at 402 Xujiahui Road. After smoking opium, he wrote several suicide notes at his desk (to Mr. and Mrs. Wang, Mr. and Mrs. Chen Zhuo, and the girl A Jin). As he was about to finish writing, at about 10 o'clock, the inn's tea waiter, Ni Xinghua (29 years old from Chongming), caught a glimpse of him and noticed that his appearance was unusual. He immediately asked him. Kan said, "I have taken poison and committed suicide. Please notify my master and tell him the address." The waiter rushed to report to his employer, Wang Ji. Then, Chen Zhuofu, the master of A Jin, rushed to the scene and took a car to Guangci Hospital. The poison recurred, and he was sent to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 4 p.m. the next day. The hospital reported to the French police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Because there were no family members in Shanghai, the employer's representative, Mr. A, the witness Chen Zhuofu, Ni Xinghua, and the maid A Jin were summoned to the case yesterday and reported to the Second Special Court Procuratorate. Prosecutor Wang Ren, accompanied by a forensic doctor and a clerk, arrived at noon to examine the body. He sat on the public case and questioned the witnesses. The official announced that Kan Mengxiong had died of poisoning before his death. The body was photographed, embalmed, and buried by Tongren Fuyuan Tang, waiting for family members to claim it.</p>

<p>The Taifeng Canned Food Company on Nanjing Road is currently being liquidated by the court due to litigation. The company's shareholders, Deng Ruiji, etc., previously published an advertisement to convene a shareholders' meeting to discuss follow-up measures. Yesterday (the 10th) afternoon, a provisional general meeting of shareholders was held at the Dadong Restaurant. Shareholders who registered, including representatives, totaled more than 60 households. Deng Ruren chaired the meeting, reported on the progress of the situation, and proposed a settlement plan, which mainly included: (A) requesting creditors to stop accruing interest on external debts and repay the principal in installments, starting with 10%, totaling 60,000 yuan, and handing over the property of the Huaming Match Factory to the creditors. The company would redeem it within one year. Another 200,000 yuan of debt would be allocated, and the company would issue bonds to distribute to the creditors in exchange for compensation. If the creditors are willing to use the bonds as new shares, the company will accept them. The remaining debts will be repaid in ten years. (B) The company will be reorganized. Old shares will be converted at a ratio of three shares to one share, totaling 100,000 yuan. Another 100,000 yuan of new shares will be raised, and 100,000 yuan will be borrowed by mortgaging the assets, totaling 200,000 yuan in cash, which will be used as working capital and various expenses since the suspension of business.

<p>All Young and No One to Adopt Them. The Female Bandit Wept Loudly in Court.</p>
<p>——Was She Fooled into Committing a Crime?——</p>
<p>Xue Sanzi from Funing opened a freight car company at 114 Guangfu Road, Zhabei, which was quite prosperous and had accumulated surplus capital, attracting the attention of bandits. At about 7 p.m. on May 8 of this year, three bandits suddenly broke in, each holding a pistol, and demanded 300 yuan in ransom. When they failed to obtain it, the bandits abducted Xue's beloved son, Da Shizi. Xue's wife, Xue Li, was greatly shocked and immediately reported to the police station, which sent police to search in all directions. Unexpectedly, Qin Longchi, a neighbor of Xue Sanzi, saw a bandit woman (Chen Wang) carrying Xue's child in her arms and sitting in a rickshaw on Gonghe Road. Her appearance was flustered, which made him very surprised. Knowing that the woman was not good, he stepped forward and grabbed the bandit woman. While they were arguing, Xue Li and others tracked them down and were overjoyed that their son was out of danger. The pearl was returned to Hepu. They called the police and sent the bandit woman, Chen Wang, to the Public Security Bureau and then to the local court for prosecution. She was charged with kidnapping and extortion. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Judge Yang Liting opened the tenth courtroom for the trial. The plaintiff, Xue Li, filed a case, stated the previous situation, and requested prosecution. The judge ordered the detainee, Chen Wang (also known as Zhou Zhou), to be brought to the case for questioning. She was 36 years old, from Funing. Her husband, Zhou Fengxiang, worked in a yarn factory. Due to economic pressure, she was introduced by her fellow villagers Zhang Xiaosanzi and Liu Xiaoheshang to work as a wet nurse. She was also paid to wet nurse the Xue family's child for six yuan a month. She thought that they were all fellow villagers and did not suspect anything. She rashly followed Lu Xiaosanzi and others to the door of the Xue family on Guangfu Road. Zhang Xiaosanzi did not allow her to enter but ordered her to wait at the door. After a while, Zhang Xiaosanzi carried the Xue family's child out and told her to take the child back first, saying that he still had to go in and negotiate the price of the wet nursing. Unexpectedly, she was arrested on Gonghe Xin Road and accused of being a kidnapper. It was really a false accusation. She requested an investigation. Moreover, she had four children. Because no one was willing to adopt them, they were detained with her. After she finished her statement, she held her four children and cried non-stop. The oldest child was only eight years old, and the youngest was still in swaddling clothes. The innocent children also suffered the taste of prison and suffered with their mother. At this point, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang came to court to perform his duties and said that the defendant was caught on the spot and the victim had provided evidence. There was no way to deny the case. He requested a public trial. Finally, the appointed voluntary lawyer, Chen Kuitang, stood up to defend the defendant, saying that the defendant, Chen Wang, was still an ignorant rural woman who was fooled by others and mistakenly committed a crime. She had mitigating circumstances and requested a lenient sentence and a declaration of innocence. The judge considered it concluded and awaited the verdict. Chen Wang was returned to custody to await instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Late Chen Yide's Concubine Sues to Reclaim Her Son <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Presents Photos as Proof; The Wife Firmly Denies</p>
<p>Chen Yipeizhen, a 31-year-old woman from Beiping currently residing at No. 2, Jiusi Lane, Xiangshi Road, French Concession, has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special District Court against Chen Zhou, the wife of the late Chen Yide. The suit seeks confirmation of parentage and a court order for the return of her son for upbringing. Ms. Chen claims that she had a relationship with Chen Yide, a wealthy real estate merchant from Suzhou residing at No. 260, Beile Road, in 1924. Because Chen was a Catholic and church rules forbade concubinage, he rented a house for her at No. 1024, Yongfu Lane, Avenue Edward VII, where they lived together. In July 1926, she gave birth to a son, nicknamed Xiong Guan, with the formal name Nengyi. The following year, due to Ms. Chen's poor health, Chen took the child back and entrusted him to his wife, Zhou, for upbringing. Zhou treated the child as if he were her own, born to her husband, showering him with love. Later, Chen passed away, and during the family dispute over the inheritance, Xiong Guan's existence helped to preserve the family assets. Recently, Ms. Chen has argued that her son, Xiong Guan, is growing up and should pursue his studies to become a good citizen. However, she claims that the wife, Zhou, pampers him excessively, using cars for transportation and living a life of luxury. She fears that this environment will turn him into a "high-class loafer." Therefore, she wants Zhou to return the child so she can raise him herself and enjoy the natural bond between mother and son. However, Zhou firmly denies that Xiong Guan is Ms. Chen's son, claiming he is her own biological child. This led to a breakdown in mediation, and Ms. Chen has formally filed a lawsuit, requesting a court decision. The court accepted the case, and yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Ma Yishu heard the case in Civil Courtroom No. 7. Both parties were present with their respective lawyers. The plaintiff, Chen Yipeizhen, stated, "I married Chen Yide in 1925. On July 21, 1926, I gave birth to Xiong Guan. In May of the following year, I fell ill, and Chen took the child to be raised by the defendant. Later, Chen passed away. When I went to their house, the defendant kept Xiong Guan because the family was dividing the inheritance. I often heard her falsely claiming that the child was born to me in October 1925 and that he is now ten years old. She (referring to the plaintiff) has never been to my house, and we barely know each other. Why is she suing now?" Ms. Chen replied, "The Chen family house has two stories. When I gave birth, there was obstetrician Hu Lezhen who can attest to it. Dr. Hu lives on North Sichuan Road. I was at my mother's home in Beiping for three years, which is why I am suing her now." The lawyer presented several photographs of Chen Yide, Ms. Chen, and the child as evidence. The judge asked the defendant if she recognized the people in the photos. Zhou replied, "The man is my husband. I don't know how he ended up taking pictures with another woman. I don't recognize the child in the photos."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Chinese Constable Accused by Mistress of Instigating Murder <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Mistress Has Knife Wound on Chest; Police Will Conduct Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Murui, a Chinese constable, No. 1191, from Shandong, at the Zhabei Police Station, was recently reported by his mistress, Yi Mei Yuan, along with her maternal uncle, Fang Jinxian, to the police for suspected instigation of murder. The police chief arrested Zhang and sent him to the First Special District Court yesterday morning, requesting detention. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, presented the findings of the investigation, stating that on the morning of the 7th of this month, at 2:30 AM, a woman named Gong Meiyuan, residing at a certain number on Zhoushan Road, along with her maternal uncle, Fang Jinxian, reported to the police. The police noticed that the woman had a knife wound on her chest and sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. At the same time, they ordered Chinese Detective Zhu Shoulun and Western Detective Kai Nai Tai to investigate. According to Ms. Gong, on the morning of the 6th of this month, around 10:00 AM, while she was walking on Zhoushan Road, she suddenly encountered a stranger wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants. The man told her that Constable No. 1191 had instructed him to tell her to go to the constable's house to collect money, and she could go there before 11:00 PM. Ms. Gong then went to the home of her maternal uncle, Fang Jinxian, at No. 470, Dapu Road, French Concession, and around 8:00 PM, she and Fang went to Zhang's house. While walking through the Chinese territory near the North Railway Station, they encountered the same man in the blue cloth shirt, who approached Ms. Gong and said that now was a good time to go and collect the money. He accompanied her, but when they reached Zhongxing Road, the man suddenly pulled out a knife and stabbed Ms. Gong in the chest, then dropped the knife and fled. Ms. Gong fell to the ground, injured, and was taken by Fang to the local Public Security Bureau, who then reported it to the Zhabei Police Station. Upon receiving the report, the detectives arrested Chinese Constable Zhang Murui, No. 291, at the police station. Zhang claimed that he met Gong Meiyuan around April 1930 and they began living together. In January of last year, the woman's mother and her sister came to Shanghai from their hometown and lived with them. He was responsible for all the daily expenses. However, in December, his mother also came to Shanghai from Shandong and naturally lived with them. Unexpectedly, Ms. Gong and her family objected and even broke his mother's bed, forcing her to sleep on the floor. Unable to tolerate this, he moved to No. 551, Zhoujiazui Road, and lived there with his mother. Gong often went to the Hongkou Police Station to make a scene. At that time, he was working at the Hongkou Police Station, and Chinese Deputy Chief Wen Youheng mediated the situation, ordering him to pay Gong 200 yuan in installments. To date, Chief Wen has transferred 140 yuan to Ms. Gong. However, Gong was extremely violent and continued to cause trouble at the police station. On April 29, the police took Gong to the court, but the judge reprimanded her and released her. The police accepted Zhang's request and transferred him to the Zhabei Police Station. Unexpectedly, Gong still frequently went to cause trouble, leading to this incident. He believes that Zhang was the mastermind. However, Zhang strongly denies instigating the attack. To clarify the facts, the police requested permission to detain him for further investigation. Judge Liu Yugui briefly questioned Zhang Murui and ordered his detention, postponing the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>The trolleybuses of the French Tramway Company, operating on the roads of the 17th and 18th grades from Xieqiao to the Great World, are being temporarily re-routed because the roads from Nanyang Bridge to Xieqiao are frequently damaged. The terrain is very low and the road surface is not solid, hindering the speed of the trolleybuses. The French Municipal Council has sent workers to raise the level of these roads, including Route Paul Beau, Rue du Marché, Xieqiao, and connecting roads such as Route Gustare de Galle, Avenue Hoche, Route Francis Garnier, Rue de la Porte Ouest, Avenue Joffre, Avenue de l'Observatoire, and Route Conty, by approximately one foot. Temporarily, the trolleybuses will be re-routed from Xieqiao via Boulevard de la Mission, to Route Francis Garnier, then east to Avenue Joffre, and north to the back gate of the Jingjiang Public Institute, connected to the French territory, then entering Nanyang Bridge iron gate, and continuing on the original route to the Great World. Once the repairs are completed, the trolleybuses will resume their original route.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Judgment in the Case Against Zhu Ziyun: The National Medical Association Proves the Prescription Was Not Inappropriate; The Court Found Zhu Ziyun Not Guilty Yesterday in Court <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Ruiting, a clerk at the British American Tobacco Company from Wujiang, who lives at No. 2, Samsungli, Wansheng Bridge, Nanshi, recently hired lawyer Jiang Rong to file a criminal lawsuit in the First Special District Court of Shanghai against Zhu Ziyun, a Jiangwan pediatrician and traditional Chinese medicine doctor, for negligence in his practice that resulted in the tragic death of his five-year-old son, Binggen. The First Special District Court has concluded the trial, and details were recorded in this newspaper. Judge Feng Shide, who was presiding over the case, felt it necessary to send the prescription to the Shanghai National Medical Association for evaluation. He then announced the cancellation of the closing arguments and reopened the debate. The court has now received the evaluation report from the National Medical Association. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng continued the hearing in the Criminal Courtroom No. 2 and announced the National Medical Association's evaluation, stating that Zhu Ziyun's prescription was not inappropriate. The plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Rong, immediately stated that the plaintiff had previously requested the court to send the case to the Central National Medical Museum for evaluation because, according to the plaintiff's knowledge, Zhu Ziyun had a special relationship with the National Medical Association. The plaintiff also received an anonymous letter from a Mr. Chen on Yong'an Street, also stating Zhu's relationship with the association. Now, the National Medical Association's evaluation only states that the herbs prescribed by Zhu Ziyun were indeed for the treatment of rubella, without any academic explanation. Therefore, the plaintiff fundamentally distrusts the evaluation. Furthermore, the plaintiff purchased the National Medical Encyclopedia, which, compared to Zhu Ziyun's prescription, shows that the herbs were entirely cooling, such as Xiaochuan Lian, mulberry leaves, and bamboo leaves, with very few diaphoretic herbs, which could cause the rubella to sink inward. The defendant's statements did not explain the source or nature of the herbs prescribed. Judge Feng stated that since the National Medical Association's evaluation could not be proven to be biased, there was no need for another evaluation. He then ordered the start of the arguments. The plaintiff's lawyer argued on academic facts, requesting that Zhu Ziyun be punished with the deserved punishment. Subsequently, lawyer Lu Qi argued on behalf of the defendant. There is no guarantee that every patient will survive. Now, Zhu Ziyun's prescription was not wrong. Traditional Chinese medicine cannot be interpreted out of context. The entire prescription must be explored together. The National Medical Association has evaluated Zhu's prescription and found that there was nothing inappropriate about it. The plaintiff alleged that Zhu Ziyun had a special relationship with the association. The defendant strongly denies this point. The plaintiff should bear the burden of proof and cannot make an empty argument. Furthermore, the National Medical Association's evaluation was a public decision made by all medical groups in Shanghai. Assuming that Zhu Ziyun had a considerable relationship with the National Medical Association and was biased, it would be impossible for him to have the power to have all the TCM doctors in the city protect him. Therefore, the plaintiff's argument is completely unfounded, and the defendant should be found not guilty. Judge Feng deliberated and announced the end of the arguments, finding Zhu Ziyun not guilty in court.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Investigation Reveals that Bandits Committed Two Robberies <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Huang Yufu and Li Pengfei, detectives from the Yulin Road Police Station, learned on the evening of the 28th of last month, at 11:00 PM, that bandits were hiding at No. 450 on the same road. They secretly apprehended Wu Gaolin, Yu A'rong, and Wang Kaijin from Ningbo. They seized stolen goods, including gold treasure rings and qipaos. They learned that there were accomplices, Liu Pengfei, Yuan Zhongyin, and Zhang A'san from Ningbo, hiding at No. 35 Dexing Lane, Hongjiang Road, Zhabei. The detectives then went and joined forces with detectives from the local Public Security Bureau and apprehended Liu and the other two. They seized three fake handguns and over 50 yuan in stolen money. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. During the investigation, two robberies were discovered: (1) On May 20, at 2:30 PM, they conspired to rob Shen Guocai's home at No. 11, Lane 411, Gongping Road, of clothing and silver worth 206 yuan. (2) On the 24th of the same month, at 8:45 AM, they robbed the possessions of Zhou Mingding, a resident of No. 58, Lane 126, Huade Road, of 185 yuan. Yesterday, they were all sent to Criminal Courtroom No. 3. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer for the Public Works Department, explained the previous circumstances. The Chinese and Western detectives reported on the investigation, and the victims Shen Guocai and Zhou Mingding testified about the robberies.

<p>At 11:40 PM the night before last, a fire broke out in a chicken and duck shop at No. 204, at the intersection of the East Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession's Caishi Street. The shop owner was upstairs and did not know how a fire started on the cotton quilt and clothes. Smoke and flames immediately filled the air, making it impossible to approach. Neighbors noticed and immediately ran to tell the patrolling constable, who reported it to the fire brigade. The fire brigade quickly arrived with a pumper and managed to extinguish the fire. Only the floorboards, walls, and stairs of the mezzanine were damaged, and the stairs were almost burned through. The second and third floors were full of tenants. If the fire had spread, the tenants upstairs would have had no way to escape. Fortunately, it did not spread. It is reported that the chicken and duck shop had fire insurance of several thousand taels. The police are thoroughly investigating the cause of the fire for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Treating Life as a Game: Two Women Attempt Suicide in the Huangpu River and are Rescued: Neither Had Any Need to Commit Suicide, Seemingly Both are Mentally Ill <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Around 11 o'clock yesterday morning, two young women attempted to throw themselves into the Huangpu River, but were unsuccessful. The reasons for their suicide attempts were: one felt ashamed for beating her husband, and the other was beaten by her husband. Coincidentally, both were quite loquacious. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Gui</p>
<p>Mao Zhongmao, a native of Ningbo, lives at No. 11, Dade Li, Yangshupu Road. He works at a factory in Longhua and is naturally timid. His wife, A Gui, is 25 years old, also from Ningbo, and is fiercely shrewish. When she roars like a lion, Mao dares not resist. However, Mao mostly resides at the factory. Recently, after returning home, he angered his wife for some reason. A Gui punched and kicked him, and then locked him in a room, depriving him of his freedom. A Gui, realizing her shame towards her husband, left alone, whereabouts unknown. Mao, released by a neighbor, waited two days for his wife to return and then sent a letter to his in-laws stating the situation to clear his name. Unexpectedly, A Gui went to the outside of the Xinguanshenmatou Wharf alone at 11 o'clock yesterday morning, intending to commit suicide by throwing herself into the Huangpu River. She hesitated before jumping. A Chinese constable from the West Sea Customs Water Police Station saw her and took her to the police station. She claimed that her husband disregarded her personal life, which led to her disillusionment with the world. The police station then ordered detective Li Wenzhu to investigate at the address. Neighbors stated that A Gui was fierce and abusive towards her husband, accusing her of feigning suicide to cover up her actions. The neighbors were told to wait for Mao to return home and then be brought to the police station for questioning.</p>
<p>Shu Ying</p>
<p>Zhang Shu Ying, a 22-year-old woman from Jiujiang, with a perm and fashionable attire, and a passable appearance, was married to her late husband. She remarried Jin Gaolong, a fellow native, and came to Shanghai with him, residing at No. 129, Minhou South Li, Hartung Road. Jin was originally a boatman, but is now unemployed. Recently, he accused his wife of infidelity and severely beat her, causing Shu Ying to be covered in bruises. Extremely resentful and disillusioned with the world, she went to the Xinguanshenmatou Wharf alone at 11 o'clock yesterday morning, boarded a sampan docked by Ah Hua, and pretended to cross to Pudong. When the boat reached the center of the river, she suddenly jumped to the bow, hoping to commit suicide by throwing herself into the Huangpu River. The sampan operator grabbed her and sent her to the Customs Water Police Station. When asked about the reason for her suicide attempt, Shu Ying, with tears in her eyes, took down her trousers, saying that her lower body was severely injured and requested an examination. The police station staff all saw her as a strange woman. Shu Ying then claimed that when she lived on the fifth floor of a building, her husband stabbed her right arm with a knife and falsely accused someone named Jia on the second floor of rape, intending to extort money. The matter was taken to the police station and sent to the Special District Court, where the man was imprisoned. She stated that the scar was still there. The police station dispatched detective Huang Songsheng to summon Jin Gaolong to the station. After the couple confronted each other, Shu Ying firmly refused to return with her husband. The police chief, unable to mediate the situation, decided to send her to the local court for a decision.</p>

<p>The Riyong Shenghuo She (Daily Life Society), located at the west end of Avenue Foch and Route Maier, announced in this year's "Life Quick View" that the newly revised Greater Shanghai Map was originally scheduled for publication in mid-May. However, due to the large number of new public buildings in the city, surveyors were sent to conduct on-site investigations and include them in the map. As a result, the printing work was extended. The map is now being printed day and night and is expected to be released by the end of this month. It is reported that approximately 60,000 one-corner coupons were included in the "Life Quick View." The cost of the six-color printing of the map is exceptionally high, requiring considerable sacrifice. Therefore, some restrictions had to be imposed. According to the society, the map is priced at four corners, but those who send in a letter with a coupon before the end of June will still be charged one corner. This preferential treatment is only valid at the Daily Life Community General Distribution Office. After the deadline, the price will be discounted by 20%.</p>

Success can be expected in the future. She hopes that the association will continue its efforts tirelessly to achieve its goals.</p>

<p>The branch of Wei Ya Restaurant on Sima Road has always been praised for its clean dishes and magnificent halls. The restaurant is now offering special treatment to the academic community, as many people hold wedding ceremonies during the summer vacation graduation period. However, because relatives and friends are far away, there are not many tables, making it difficult to choose a venue. Therefore, regardless of the price of the dishes and the number of tables, the restaurant's hall can be used. It is not only magnificent and resplendent, but also free of all miscellaneous expenses, making it particularly economical and cost-effective. For only a few dozen yuan, this beautiful event can be held. It is also heard that the restaurant's famous Cantonese vegetarian cuisine will be available from the 15th of this month.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I have recently read a news report in your newspaper on the 7th of this month entitled "Fighting over Passengers, Disregarding Knives." The report stated that Yu Qi, a Cantonese man working as a host at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, and his fellow native Chen Huaye, started a fight over passengers and injured people. It was reported that a passenger named Yu Jinhe, who recently arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong, was staying in room 403. According to the hotel's custom, guests who are new to Shanghai and unfamiliar with the area are to be accompanied by a host to various places for sightseeing. This is astonishing. After investigating, our hotel does not have an employee named Yu Qi or Chen Huaye. According to the police records, Yu and Chen also stated that they had no occupation. Furthermore, our hotel has no custom of having a host accompany guests for sightseeing. The guest staying in room 403 is also not named Yu Jinhe. It is believed that the report is inaccurate. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to request that you verify the facts and make a correction. Sincerely, The New Asia Hotel, June 10</p>
<h3 id="e173">Reader Submission: Chinese People Urgently Need to Change Their Mentality <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>The Chinese people have long held a superstitious mentality towards foreign businesses. Even in the financial sector, the general public views foreign banks as the most trustworthy, while often neglecting or even intentionally criticizing domestic banks. The reason given is that foreigners have excellent credit, and foreign banks have substantial and reliable capital. For decades, this mentality has been deeply rooted in the minds of the Chinese people and is difficult to change.</p>
<p>But what is the credit of foreign banks really like? Let's briefly examine the facts over the years. In the past decade or so, many foreign banks have gone bankrupt or suspended operations: (1) Shanghai Guangxing Bank, established by American businessmen in 1919, was closed and liquidated in 1922 due to poor business performance and the impact of the failure of the Eastern Grand Bank. (2) Zhihua Bank, established in 1918 by the American Insurance Trust Company, Commercial Bank, San Francisco National Bank, and Chicago Continental Bank, was closed in 1924 due to losses from gold trading. (3) Datong Bank, a Sino-Japanese joint venture, suspended operations in 1927 due to heavy withdrawals during political unrest, as related banks refused to provide assistance. (4) The Sino-French Industrial Bank, established in 1912 with its headquarters in Paris and branches in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Yunnan, Guangzhou, Shantou, and Fengtian, had the right to issue currency in China but suspended operations in the second half of 1921 due to poor business management. (5) The Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank was initially backed by the Russian government, but its business was severely affected after Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, and its branches in China were closed. (6) The Sino-Japanese Joint Venture Bank of China, with a branch in Shanghai, closed in the winter of 1928 due to runs in Tianjin and international political relations. (7) The China-American Maoye Bank, a Sino-American joint venture with its headquarters in Beijing and a branch in Shanghai, collapsed due to poor business management. Most recently, the American Merchant Meifeng Bank suddenly announced its closure. All of these banks, whether foreign-owned or Sino-foreign joint ventures, have gone bankrupt, proving that creditworthiness is what makes a bank successful, regardless of its origins.</p>
<p>Meifeng Bank had been in business for twenty years, with a capital of US$550,000 and Chinese currency $1,250,000, a public reserve of over Chinese currency $2 million, and total assets and liabilities of approximately $20 million. It was considered a mid-to-upper-level foreign bank, and the Chinese people had great faith in it. In 1932, its deposits totaled over 10,330,000 yuan, and recent reports indicate that they were between 8 and 9 million yuan. Depositors came from forty countries, with Russian and American depositors being the most numerous, but we estimate that Chinese deposits in the bank were very substantial.</p>
<p>Foreign banks take advantage of the consular jurisdiction granted by unequal treaties and are not subject to Chinese law. Many of those that go bankrupt are never properly liquidated, and only a few are fully liquidated. The best outcome is usually a long-term payment with non-interest-bearing bonds. The Chinese people suffer greatly from this, but cannot complain. Even if a foreign bank is truly substantial and reliable, it will only fully utilize Chinese deposits to engage in various speculative activities. Meifeng was affected by its own country's silver policy, which caused land prices to plummet, exchange rates to fall sharply, and speculation in American stocks. Its reserves were depleted, leading to a standstill. The dangers of its business were evident, yet the Chinese people ignored this and remained blindly superstitious. This is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>From now on, the Chinese people should learn from the closure of Meifeng Bank and fundamentally break the superstitious mentality towards foreigners. They should focus on domestic banks and deeply trust them. As the saying goes, it is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost. It is not too late for us to change our mentality. In fact, many domestic banks are well-funded and have excellent credit. Only a few small banks that are not members of the industry association are slightly inferior. As for the issuance of convertible notes, in terms of reserve requirements, Chinese banks hold 60% in cash and 40% in securities, or even more than 60% in cash. Foreign banks use different reserve ratios, such as 2:1, 3:1, or 40%, but all are lower than the ratio set by our country. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>Moreover, the government is making every effort to regulate and improve the financial system. Although the market is sluggish, the future holds much promise. In short, our gaze should be based on facts. For the sake of the individual and the nation, we must trust Chinese banks.</p>

<p>I often see opium addicts gather up all the dross from their opium lamps, to burn for another hit; they also lick all traces from their trays. Not a single bit of waste! If we young people could be as frugal with our time and money, not wasting a bit, then that would be great! When we are sitting in a vehicle, the road ahead seems to be still, unmoving. But when we turn to look at the road behind us, it rushes by like water. This is a clear indication that "the road forward requires effort and gradual progress to reach the goal! But if you retreat, then it will be very fast indeed.”</p>
<p>Speaking of money, everyone curses it, especially those of us who are poor. But it is an ignorant and stupid thing. All the evil and all the power are created by human folly. If we have enough money, then we will forget ourselves and use the money to dominate the weak!</p>
<h3 id="e175">A Visitor from Jinan Speaks <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Niang</p>
<p>A colleague, Mr. Ma, has returned from Jinan and told me about the recent situation there. I have recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan is the location of the Shandong provincial government. All civil servants, under the direction of Chairman Han Fuju, must wear black uniforms and hats when going to and from work. Recently, a weekly meeting is held every Monday at the large parade ground outside Jinan city, about seven or eight Chinese miles from the city. The meeting is scheduled for 5:00 AM. Those coming from the city are not allowed to travel by carriage or horse. Chairman Han also leads by example and walks there around 4:00 AM. At 5:00 AM sharp, he personally calls the roll, and no one dares to be absent. Those who are a few minutes late will be sent back to their original county governments by the headquarters to be taken care of and await punishment.</p>
<p>Those who serve the provincial government, except for those who have family members who can freely rent houses outside, must live in dormitories. It is said that the provincial government dormitories are very large, but there is only one toilet, and it is far from the dormitories. During the cold winter months, even to urinate or defecate is a difficult trek. Therefore, some people have adopted a chamber pot policy to overcome this difficulty. When Chairman Han discovered this, he imposed a one-month salary reduction for "laziness." Since then, the chamber pot policy has been shut down, and some people have promoted the use of spittoons instead of chamber pots, but the results have been the same and they have been punished.</p>
<p>All civil servants in Jinan wear homespun clothing, which is very plain. It is said that a civil servant wore woven woolen shoes to work and was seen by Chairman Han. Chairman Han immediately saluted him. The civil servant was at a loss and did not know what to do. Han said, "I am not saluting you, I am saluting your beautiful shoes." The civil servant immediately took off his shoes on the spot. Sadly, a pair of socks was sacrificed.</p>
<p>The weather in Jinan in late spring is still cold, so many people still wear heavy cotton-padded coats and trousers. This is very different from the areas south of the Yangtze River, where it is too hot to wear a lined jacket.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Philosophy of Drinking <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>One can discern a person's character through their drinking habits. People tend to be reserved and restrained in ordinary circumstances. This restraint is to preserve one's face, so their demeanor is often unnatural. However, after three cups of yellow wine, one unconsciously speaks without reservation and acts without constraint. Therefore, to observe a person, one should observe them while drinking.</p>
<p>A person dressed in coarse cloth, wearing straw sandals, standing at the entrance of a wine shop, digging out a few copper coins to exchange for a cup of white liquor, drinking it all in one gulp, and then covering their nose and mouth with their hand, unwilling to let even a trace of the alcohol escape, is someone who rarely drinks; hence, they cherish it greatly. Their purpose in drinking is not for enjoyment, but to dispel the cold or to invigorate themselves, so that they can continue to toil like beasts of burden.</p>
<p>Three or four friends stroll into a tavern, order dishes before even drinking. They engage in finger-guessing games, faces red and veins bulging, voices shaking the surroundings; moreover, they are unwilling to yield to each other, as if they have deep-seated hatred. If, by accident, a wine pot is overturned, they do not regret it much, and simply order another. These friends do not know how to drink. If even decades-old vintage wines are consumed in this way, onlookers would truly feel sorry for those fine wines. People who drink like this are probably fond of activity and not fond of stillness.</p>
<p>One or two close friends sit facing each other at a table. The dishes do not need to be exquisite, but good wine must be consumed. They sip gently, engage in quiet conversation, and stop drinking when they have had enough, not adding more wine. These friends truly know how to drink; their character is rarely muddled, or their temper has already completely subsided.</p>
<p>As for those who go mad after drinking, some prefer gentle persuasion, while others prefer harsh persuasion; from this, one can also discern a person's character.</p>

<p>What do you say, what should we do? Naturally, we can't say that we should block transportation because of the influx of foreign goods, but it seems we can't just let things be, since foreign goods sell best where transportation is most convenient. We should think of a way to guard against this. Otherwise, it seems that the roads are entirely for the convenience of foreign merchants. Zhou Yourong laughed, saying: "What you say is indeed correct, but what can we do? Unless we build tariff barriers and heavily tax imported foreign goods. But it seems China is not entirely free to raise taxes on foreign goods, is it?" After speaking, he also sighed. In the time it took to turn his head, he saw a ceramic camel on the table, and smiled, saying: "Mr. Cheng, do you also like this?" Zhiqian said: "It's not that I like it, someone insisted on putting it here." Then he recounted what had happened earlier. Yourong smiled, saying: "Your room is lively, one moment it's affairs of state, the next it's private matters between a man and a woman. I forgot to ask, how are things with that girl?" Zhiqian smiled slightly, saying: "It's funny when you talk about it. That girl, my tutoring student, greatly misunderstood and thought I had some interest in that girl, and she became quite jealous of me. Actually, even if I'm not talented, how could I take advantage of someone in danger and plot against a refugee girl? But my student was very unforgiving and left in anger. I think she was quite angry." Yourong laughed, saying: "This matter is naturally quite suspicious. That girl took off all her clothes and actually fell asleep on your bed. And you're not fifty or sixty years old, and you're being particularly attentive to this girl, how could she not be suspicious?" (236)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Remember! We must all be extremely careful today." Eight people exhorted each other: "No matter what, don't do anything to offend the Empress Dowager; as long as we can always show a smile, and respectfully obey orders, then today will surely be happy from beginning to end, and perhaps her smile will thus be able to extend for a few more days."</p>
<p>These words were naturally welcomed by everyone, and they carefully returned to their designated duties.</p>
<p>Kunming Lake is a famous scenic spot in the Summer Palace. Although it is man-made, it is quite wide enough for the Empress Dowager to travel back and forth in her yacht. Regarding the Empress Dowager's yacht, the author has already mentioned it in Chapter 13; but to preserve the old system of the palace, we may as well still call it the "Imperial Boat." The Imperial Boat does not often appear on Kunming Lake, because the Empress Dowager is not as free as Grandmother Jia in "Dream of the Red Chamber." Only in a period after late spring and before early autumn can she slightly enjoy the pleasure of touring the lake: so today's outing can truly be considered a rare event.</p>
<p>The style of the "Imperial Boat" is very ordinary, just a large boat with a canopy, using oars and bamboo poles as tools for sailing; in the middle, there is also a cabin, but it is built particularly tall, and carved exquisitely, with vermilion lacquer shining brightly, having the same gorgeousness as those palaces on the shore. Therefore, it is not wrong for me to call it a "floating palace on the lake!" (336)</p>
<h3 id="e179">Floating Palace on the Lake <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>

<p>— (Shu Fan)</p>
<p>On the south side of Mount Xi, there is a spring called White Sand. The local gazetteer records: it does not dry up even in severe droughts and irrigates thousands of acres of fields. Below it is a large pool, with water even darker and deeper, which the locals call the East Big Pond. It is secluded and deeply hidden, rarely visited by tourists. This month, on a certain Sunday, I returned from the Two Caves in Yixing and passed by Meiyuan. My servant told me about it, so I ventured into it. The pond is more than two li away from the road, and can be reached on foot; at first glance, it doesn't seem very special, but after exploring it thoroughly, one realizes its extraordinary nature. Walking along the eastern cliff of the pond, passing "Peach Blossom Spring," the ancient pines are transformed into dragons, appearing to seize people; looking across the bank, the dense shade obscures the setting sun, and the faint sunlight leaks through like golden threads, like green hair; entering the pond, the fish stir up the waves, and from time to time create water flowers that fly onto the treetops and into one's sleeves; there are also crows cawing urgently, a scene that even the most skilled artist would find difficult to depict. To the north, Mount Hui forms a barrier, deep and solemn, like a large encircling screen. Extending westward, it becomes a lush forest, stretching for three or four li, the East Pond like a half-ring of green grave jade, a clear atmosphere overflowing, with pine resin and bamboo powder intermingling. Circulating around the pond, opening up a secluded space, one cannot but fully appreciate its charm. A square pond, half a mirror, and yet so much contained within, it is truly extraordinary!</p>
<p>Places Visited</p>
<h3 id="e181">Scenic Spots of Southern Zhao <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Lifang</p>
<p>In the pleasant fourth month, the weather is neither cold nor warm, it is truly the season for travel. I, along with Lu and Ye, embarked on a boat, drifting on the Zhao Creek. Originally, we intended to go to Cloud Nest, but the north wind was blowing strongly, and the boatman didn't have the strength to row the boat to Cloud Nest in one day. Amidst the sounds of oars, before we knew it, the moon was rising at dusk, and we docked at Digang for the night.</p>
<p>The next morning, we took a walk ashore, and Lu Ye led me into the scenic spots of Southern Zhao.</p>
<p>This place is not a Buddhist palace, nor is it a hermit's abode. Instead, it is a spirit writing altar dedicated to Lu Zu, presided over by ordinary people. Although they seem to be establishing teachings like a religious order, they also somewhat resemble a gathering place for scholars and students to cultivate themselves. According to the inscription on the stele erected inside: this place is called Yunyi Hall, founded during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty. Their undertakings are all in the realm of charity, such as releasing animals, cherishing written words, providing medical care, dispensing medicine, running charitable schools, as well as prolonging life and delivering the dead, which is close to the era of divine power. The words "Scenic Spots of Southern Zhao" are the four large characters on the wall in front of the gate, which have not encountered the disasters of war. There is a story passed down about this place, which Lu Ye told me, and it goes like this:</p>
<p>At that time, when the troubles of war arose, the disciples in this Yunyi Hall all went to ask Lu Zu. The spirit writing pen came down, but it said, "The scenic spots of Southern Zhao are unharmed." Therefore, the people of Digang all took refuge here, but unexpectedly, they were all burned to ashes. After the rebellion was quelled, only the four characters "Scenic Spots of Southern Zhao" remained, and all the other buildings were reduced to ashes. Perhaps that was the wonderful writing of the spirit writing friends, let's not mention that for now.</p>
<p>We came to sightsee, so we naturally couldn't ignore the task of collecting local customs and habits. We only felt that the scenic spots of Southern Zhao are truly the scenic spots of Southern Zhao.</p>
<p>After entering the gate, there is a courtyard of flowers and trees. In the middle is a large fish pond, across which spans a stone bridge resembling a long rainbow. Around it are neat stone railings. Dozens of golden carp are kept in the pond. Leaning against the railings and watching them, one experiences the joy of Zhuangzi on the Hao River. This charm is no less than that of the Jade Spring on the lake. On both sides are rows of open halls, with courtyards such as Ode to Wine Studio and Tung Tree Shade Retreat. If one had the opportunity to study here throughout the four seasons, one would truly have the feeling of enjoying studying, how wonderful!</p>
<p>Yunyi Hall is built facing the pond. Going in from here, there are winding corridors, creating an engaging atmosphere. In the backyard, there are even more randomly stacked artificial mountains. On one side, ancient trees reach the sky, and on the other side, famous flowers are planted in profusion. At the end of the corridor, there is a four-sided hall, which also has a garden-like flavor. Unfortunately, it seems that it has not been repaired for a long time, so the weeds have grown over one's ankles.</p>
<p>There are also many calligraphic works by famous people here, such as Liang Shanzhou, Zhu Shijun, and Peng Yulin, all with their own touch. The elegance of the names of all the courtyards is rarely seen elsewhere. For example, the "Play and Enjoy Admonition" written by Liang Shanzhou, and the place for offering sacrifices to Kui Xing, named "Reading Place," it is truly ingenious and skillfully obtained.</p>
<p>In a hurried glance, we strolled around this small town, only to see a stream of water encircling the small market town in the middle. The secluded streets and alleys were quiet, with no one coming or going, making us worldly people feel refreshed. This small market town is also the scenic spots of Southern Zhao!</p>

Mr. Huang Renlin plans to suggest to Chu Minyi, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Games, that a handball court be added to the Shanghai Municipal Central District Sports Field so that players from all provinces can appreciate the essence of the sport when the National Games are held, in order to popularize it. It is reported that Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the leader of handball in Shanghai, is quite sympathetic to this move and will also suggest it to the Standing Committee in the near future.</p>

It is expected that there will be no problems.</p>
<p>Representatives Meeting</p>
<p>The federation has revised its constitution this year to accommodate members who do not have their own courts, which has made it difficult to allocate court venues. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold a representatives' meeting at 5:00 PM on the 14th of this month (Friday) at the Shanghai Racecourse Fellow's Club in Luhuatang, Ma Huo Road, to discuss important issues such as allocation. Secretary Lu Xiniu has already sent a letter to the president and various committee members of the federation, as well as to the various member associations, requesting them to send a representative to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>Large Number of Students Preparing to Study Abroad</p>
<p>The summer vacation is approaching, and the semester is coming to an end. Graduates from public and private colleges and universities in the country are preparing to study abroad. The Global Chinese Student Association in this city has recently been busy handling procedures for studying abroad. According to Wu Deyin, director of the association's travel and reception department, due to the sharp decline in the U.S. dollar this year, the number of students going to the United States has increased compared to the past. It is estimated that there will be more than 200 students going to the United States this year. Although the number of students going to Japan has been restricted by the Ministry of Education's preliminary funding plans, most have not followed the Ministry's instructions. Therefore, the number of students going to Japan this year is still considerable.</p>
<p>Procedures for Applying for Study Abroad Certificates</p>
<p>Many students are unclear about the procedures for applying for study abroad certificates from the Ministry of Education. The Global Student Association will issue the following statement: When applying for a study abroad certificate from the Ministry of Education, the following documents are required for those going to Japan: diploma (graduates of colleges and universities are qualified), two photos, certificate stamp fee of three yuan, guarantee letter, and bank or institution deposit certificate. For those going to Europe and the United States, the required documents are the same as for Japan, except that there is no need to submit a deposit certificate. For those who are unclear about the procedures for applying for a passport, inquiries can be made to the association, and a response will be provided the next day.</p>
<p>Farewell Party to be Held Next Month</p>
<p>The Global Student Association and various institutions and schools hold a farewell party for students studying abroad every year.

<p>Suzhou Phonetic Symbols</p>
<p>The Suzhou phonetic symbols were determined by Wu Zhihui and Chen Songping in the 8th year of the Republic and published on a large sheet. They were revised by Zhao Yuanren in the 19th year and compiled into a general table of phonetic symbols. This time, they have been revised again, with a total of 33 initials, 21 finals, and 17 combined finals, totaling 81. The symbol style is mainly designed to be convenient for the public, easy to recognize and remember. It is said that the new table of 30,000 copies has been printed by the Mandarin Unification Association and will soon be transported to Suzhou for application.</p>
<p>Compilation and Printing of Books and Newspapers</p>
<p>Committee member Guo Luji, based on the revised Suzhou phonetic symbol table, collected more than 4,000 commonly used Suzhou characters and compiled a "Suzhou Homophone Character Table." He also compiled a "Suzhou Phonetic Symbol Textbook" and a "Suzhou Phonetic Symbol Writing Template." He has also recently compiled a set of "Suzhou Phonetic Symbol Supplementary Books." All the books have been completed and sent to Shanghai for printing. It is expected that they will be published in mid-May.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw a favorable turn in the situation in Hebei, with the possibility of a peaceful resolution improving the atmosphere. The entire short-selling front shook, with retail investors rushing to cover their positions and large investors turning from short to long. The upward trend was strong, and all bonds rose in unison. Salt tax bonds and treasury bonds even surged by four yuan and halted trading, contrasting sharply with the sharp drop and halt at the end of last week. The volatility was so wild and sudden that it made operators lose their composure. Trading was extremely active, with a total turnover of more than 40 million yuan in the morning and afternoon sessions, truly a rare and grand occasion for the public bond market. The trend and future are temporarily expected to have another twist and turn. The market for the 96 public bond rose even more sharply yesterday and was unstoppable, because large short positions had been covered, the short side suddenly appeared weak, and the strength of the long side suddenly increased. In addition, the stimulus of a certain rumor favorable to the long side made the rise even more fierce. In the morning session, the near-term rose by 6.5 jiao and the far-term rose by more than one yuan. At the close, the near-term surged by one yuan, and the far-term did not continue to rise due to selling by the long side, and the market price was inverted. The market may recover slightly today. Yesterday's market price results showed a uniform surge of more than one yuan to a huge four yuan. There were large orders from the 4th, 21st, 48th, and 44th brokers, and most of the selling orders were scattered. The comparison table of the highest and lowest results is listed on the left.</p>

The afternoon session opened slightly lower, and the table was flat and tired, and the shape was calm. The trading became tight after the second and third sessions, because Runkang continued to cover short positions. The near-month closed sharply higher, and the Sichuan merchants' spot purchases were smoother and rose higher, but the far-month was normal. As a result, the near-month rose by another 3.4 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the far-month rose by 1.2 jiao. It was found that 850 bales were sold by Jifeng, 800 bales by Yida, 800 bales by Yuanda, 1,450 bales by Mingde, 1,250 bales by Ruida, 1,600 bales by Dachang, 2,050 bales by Xincheng, 550 bales by Deji, 950 bales by Jinchang, 600 bales by Shenji, and 1,100 bales by Changfeng. 1,250 bales were bought by Dafu, 2,700 bales by Tongji, 2,050 bales by Shenchang, 2,100 bales by Changyu, 2,450 bales by Yuanyi, 4,650 bales by Runkang, 1,100 bales by Suilong, and 1,350 bales by Hexing.

<p>After a sharp decline, the cotton market has rebounded rapidly. This is primarily due to positive news regarding peace and a rebound in the yarn market, which has boosted confidence. American cotton prices are rising, with floating positions being covered. However, foreign merchants are still selling on the rallies. Local cotton stocks remain ample, and factories are suspending operations, with little hope of a return to normal, as the demand for raw materials has decreased.</p>
<p>Special Trading Session Sees Gains Across May and June</p>
<p>In the pre-market session, all months rose uniformly, displaying a sharp upward trend. This was largely due to the intensity of the rebound following consecutive days of decline. Foreign merchants continued to sell, with the distant months slightly lower at the close. Ultimately, all months closed up four to five and a half jiao compared to the previous day’s close. The market was relatively flat in the afternoon session, with all months falling by one to one and a half jiao. However, the second and third auctions were slightly higher. The market tightened sharply at the close due to positive news regarding American cotton prices, supporting the market. However, the distant months saw a decline of five fen in the auction. As a result, all months closed up five fen to 1.2 jiao compared to the morning close. The following sales were recorded: Geng Feng 2,000 dan, Tong Ji 4,220 dan, Ji Feng 3,100 dan, He Xing 5,500 dan, Tai Yu 2,100 dan, Shen Chang 3,800 dan (partially), Rui Da 5,000 dan, Shen Ji 17,200 dan, Xin Cheng 1,300 dan, Yi Feng 5,500 dan, Chang Yu 3,600 dan, and Da Chang 1,900 dan.

<p>The Bombay cotton market remained bleak last week. Prices fell due to the liquidation of long positions in the April-May white cotton contracts and sales by Japanese merchants. At the same time, fluctuating Franc prices hindered buyers, resulting in low transaction volumes and scarce factory demand, due to sluggish sales of finished products. Export demand was flat, with sellers acting normally and buyers proceeding cautiously. The attached weekly statistics are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Liverpool: Spot cotton transactions were moderate last week. The futures market saw a temporary price dip due to the liquidation of large long positions following President Roosevelt’s announcement. However, prices rebounded as Roosevelt's overstatement was rectified. The fluctuating silver coin prices contributed to market volatility. There was some buying interest from the Far East, but market sentiment remained cautious, awaiting developments regarding new cotton loans and export subsidies. Egyptian cotton prices have recently rebounded slightly. Demand picked up after the price drop, but transactions remained sluggish.</p>
<p>Manchester cloth prices were slightly softer. Shirt cloth fell one penny to ten shillings and one penny, and printed cloth fell three pence to twenty-one shillings and nine pence.</p>

<p>The flour market rebounded sharply after opening this morning. The shoreline wheat quotation was about two to three jiao better than Chicago's. Canadian wheat was unchanged. The prior week's decline was deemed excessive. Tianjin has recently turned slightly more active. According to the consolidated price there, it is already close to reasonable (currently selling at 4.5 jiao). Therefore, these merchants are buying the near-term contracts, immediately stirring up excitement. For the deferred contracts, inland merchants' intentions are also good. They are progressing smoothly. At the closing, the near-term contracts were up three to four fen, and the deferred contracts were up two to three fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, initial rain showers softened sentiment slightly. However, renewed bidding by the Tianjin merchants reinvigorated the near-term contracts. Deferred contracts continued to improve due to short covering by inland merchants and local traders. It is believed that further development will depend on flour sales for stability. As a result, this month’s contract surged 5.25 fen, July’s contract rose five fen, August’s contract rose four fen, September’s contract rose three fen, October’s contract rose 2.75 fen, and November’s contract rose 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>When wheat was priced, anxiety rose in both local and foreign quarters after a long spell of dry weather in various locations. Inland merchants also raised rice prices and took a uniformly bullish stance. Therefore, after the opening, bids for all months were brisk, with transactions active, resulting in a rebound of eight fen to one jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment was greatly relieved by the rain. The July contract briefly fell five to six fen, down to 3.1 jiao. The near-term contracts also eased by three to nine fen simultaneously. Later, inland merchants' intentions turned very positive, rebounding three to four fen. Future ups and downs will depend on flour sales. As a result, the July contract rose nine fen, and the August, September, and October contracts rose eight fen. The spot wheat market remains stable, with arrivals peaking, reaching over 10,000 bags in the past two days. Dealers have not turned greedy, making it difficult to raise prices. The opening price was 3.42 yuan for wheat from Lin Huai Guan, Sha He Ji, Guan Dian, and Taizhou, 3.33 yuan for wheat from Jiang Yan, and 3.30 yuan for wheat from Taiping Fu, Yangzhou, and Hezhou, with Xin Da shipping out 2,000 bags and Shen Da shipping out 1,500 bags, it is said.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: The weather is improving. The condition of Canadian wheat is rated at 87% of normal. Short positions are being covered and rolled over in anticipation of the government's report.</p>

<p>Yesterday, only a dozen shipments of rice arrived in Shanghai's southern ports (totaling 2,500-2,600 shi). Sentiment has stabilized slightly, and the market is showing some activity. Guest merchants are also taking 150 bags. The market has recovered, with Xisu Tong geng rising sharply, Nangang early rice rising several fen to nearly a jiao, and various late rice varieties rising by varying amounts. Those rice varieties that were not high priced before the price increase remain unaffected. Previous arrivals are weakening. Suan Du Jian has shown no differences. In Shanghai's northern ports, fourteen or fifteen boats arrived from various routes along the river yesterday. The market is showing a good appetite for various types of rice. Although the outflow of Bai Geng has been normal, the scarcity of river stocks has led to high prices and tight supplies, rising nearly a jiao. Secondary rice varieties are priced at an additional jiao, and Bo Dao continues to trade in small volumes, with prices up by a jiao. Early rice is scarce, with prices up by one or two jiao. Bai Yuan arrivals are sporadic, with limited river stocks, but small volume transactions are still possible, and prices have also risen by one or two jiao. The prices of other varieties have also risen. Total sales for the day exceeded 40,000 bags.</p>

<p>Daily sales exceed 40,000 bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yang rice market was quite lively. Inland merchants, after a pause of several days, showed renewed appetite. Currently, the inland regions are experiencing drought, boosting confidence. This morning, both local merchants eagerly procured supplies, pushing the price of secondary rice varieties up sharply, by half a jiao to two jiao. Higher-quality rice varieties rose by about one jiao. Outflow to inland areas was strongest, with inquiries from the Yangtze, Shanghai, and Ningbo regions. In the afternoon, heavy rain stabilized sentiment and the market. Total sales in the city included 18,000 bags of Saigon Number One rice, 15,000 bags of Number Three rice, 5,000 bags of Xiao Jiao rice, and 4,000 bags of Siamese machine-processed rice and other refined rice varieties. Guest merchants also sold 330 bags. Further developments will depend on subsequent demand.</p>

<p>Guangjiao Copper Coins Slightly Firmer</p>
<p>The market remained largely inactive yesterday, with most prices similar to the previous day. Due to the observance of the Ascension Day holiday by foreign firms, the market appeared particularly quiet. The call loan rate remained at 1.8 jiao in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The “Hua Tou” rate plus water remained at 7 jiao, unchanged from the previous day. Call loan transactions totaled over 2.4 million in the morning session, with new transactions exceeding 300,000.

Qianzhuang foreign public notes collected over 30 million, and foreign Hua Tou loans reached over 2.1 million. As for bank collections, foreign banks were closed due to the holiday, with only Chinese banks collecting over 1.2 million in notes and over 1.7 million in various foreign exchange and other miscellaneous payments. There were no other reports.</p>
<p>The auxiliary coin market was slightly firmer yesterday. The Jiangsu small foreign coins were 827 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions, unchanged from the previous day. Only 4,000 jiao were traded in the morning session, with no transactions reported in the afternoon. Guangdong small foreign coins rose 1.5 yuan in the morning session, to 737 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's sugar market remained sluggish due to weak spot sales. The guild set the price for 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 16.2 yuan, but no trades were made. Only the local warehouse sugar was traded at 16.3 yuan, and the transit customs warehouse sugar was traded at 5.2 yuan. The local factory's refined white sugar continued to weaken. Zhen Yu Number One was 15.5 yuan, Number Two was 15.4 yuan, Number Three was 15.25 yuan, and Number Four was 15.1 yuan, down one jiao. The Chao Qing numbers remain untraded. Only sporadic transactions of Tong Shou ice sugar from the Jianbang gang continued, at 14.9 yuan per stone, with higher prices reaching 15.3 yuan, but trading was minimal.</p>

<p>Since the new Sichuan pickled mustard greens came onto the market, arrivals have increased daily, accumulating to 27,000-28,000 jars. However, sales have remained stagnant, so despite low prices, the trend remains weak. Scattered opening prices have softened further in recent days. Le Qi pickled vegetables are priced at 15 yuan to 14.5 yuan, followed by 13.5 yuan to 13 yuan. Pei Ling pickled vegetables are priced at 11 yuan to 10.5 yuan. Old goods are even weaker. Those with inventory are suffering significant losses. Yesterday's market was only around 7 yuan.</p>

<p>After crude tung oil in Hankou rose to 44 yuan per barrel, it increased by another 4 jiao. Although foreign firms continue to purchase, they believe that the price is too high and must be suppressed. Therefore, all foreign firms are refraining from purchasing at high prices. The market has inevitably suffered a setback. According to last night's Hankou dispatch, prices have fallen to 42.6 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan. This is a natural correction after the large price increase. However, foreign firms still have strong demand, and production area inventories are dwindling. The source of Hankou is becoming increasingly scarce. Even if temporarily suppressed, the overall trend is upward. This correction may temper the price increase. There is a lack of full-weight Zhejiang tung oil, and quality varies. Local foreign firms have seen little trading recently. The supply of Zhejiang tung oil is scarce, and it is even more difficult to obtain full-weight oil. Most traders are unwilling to sell, and foreign firms are unwilling to buy. The market has become unusually quiet.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market at foreign firms in Shanghai saw robust interest in Zhen Mei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi from firms like Ying Zhuang, Xie He, Jin Long, and Bao Chang. Total sales in the city exceeded 1,300 chests, with prices opening at 74-75 yuan, with little change from last week. In addition, there were sporadic sales of Zhen Mei and Xiu Mei green tea. There were no large transactions of Zhu Cha and Gong Xi. The black tea market from Qimen and Fuliang was slightly quiet yesterday, but the flower scent segment was active due to support from Russian firms and strong demand from British firms.</p>

<p>Galvanized iron sheet sales are typically strongest during the plum rain season. However, the market has deviated from its usual pattern this year. Tight credit has made transactions with customer firms and construction firms unreliable. However, sales to factories have been robust in recent days, enlivening the long-dormant market. Sales totaled 200-300 bundles, with another 100+ bundles continuing to be procured. Number 24 is estimated at 10.025 yuan per dan, Number 26 is 11.2 yuan, and Number 28 is 12.25 yuan.</p>

<p>Sales of Huayuan lead wire to Sichuan merchants have been very strong in recent days, leading to a large volume of sales. The market is robust, and prices are firm, at 3 yuan per bundle. No more shipments are arriving from Japan, and local shipments are limited, leading to positive sentiment. Sales yesterday totaled 400-500 bundles, and negotiations are underway for another 200+ bundles. This activity in the otherwise sluggish hardware market is comforting to those in the industry. While business with local merchants and other customer firms is not booming, it is no longer as stagnant as before.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Measures to Save the Match Industry <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Hongtao</p>
<p>Matches are a type of light industry that is essential for people’s lives and occupies an important position in industry. Several years ago, foreign matches flooded the market. Eventually, domestic match merchants worked hard to manage their businesses and find ways to improve their products, wiping out foreign match merchants who had been very active in the Chinese market. Looking at the disappearance of the Swedish match brand Phoenix from the market, one can see the general situation. Recently, the domestic match industry has also suffered from commercial downturns and market depression. Bankruptcies and liquidations have followed one after another. Without efforts to rescue the industry, it will become impossible to salvage. However, an examination of the causes of failure reveals that sluggish sales and stagnant inventory are to blame, stemming from overproduction and oversupply. At the same time, foreign matches are showing signs of activity again, being smuggled into the country to evade taxes, allowing them to be sold at low prices and severely impacting domestic goods. In addition, the match unified tax is more than double what it was two or three years ago, increasing costs. The unified tax has increased, but the selling price cannot increase accordingly, resulting in losses. For the current situation, match demand is fixed, and the only way to maintain prices without falling is to find ways to limit production. First, investigate how many matches the country needs each year and how many can be sold abroad. Then, calculate how many matches all the match factories in the country can produce each year. Compare the two to get a conclusion, and then make the overproduced amount and size of factories match, proportionally allocated to reduce. Therefore, the output of each factory has no risk of oversupply, the national output is in line with the number of sales, supply and demand can be adapted accordingly, and prices can also maintain balance. As for foreign goods imports and foreign merchants in Hong Kong, another should be used to make it so they have no foothold in the domestic. For foreign goods imports, the government must do its utmost to restrict them, impose heavy import taxes, and strictly check smuggling at each pass, so that the price cannot be lower than domestic goods when sold in China. If it sells cheaply, the result will not be a loss. For foreign merchants in the country, their manufacturing is done by machine, and the cost is lower. The government taxes must be higher than for Chinese merchants, so the selling price may not be reduced. At this critical time of crisis for the match industry, the unified match tax should ideally be temporarily reduced. If this cannot be done, then find a way to temporarily mark it down, without paying cash, and wait until the business has recovered before paying off the back payments on time. This way, cash can circulate more easily for merchants, reducing the burden, and the government can still collect taxes later. Otherwise, merchants cannot survive and are bound to fail. On the merchants' side, they should unite with each other and not engage in infighting. If they hold joint operations, etc., the price can be fixed uniformly, and those who violate the agreement will be punished. At the same time, they should also contact smoke and paper store merchants and ask them to refuse to accept foreign goods. After the matches are sold, they will be given a considerable commission, and the smoke and paper store merchants will be willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The match industry is indeed a business that can resist foreign goods, and we cannot bear to see it fail, so we have disclosed it. However, those who stand on invulnerable ground remain excellent in quality. It is hoped that the match industry will pay more attention to the quality of its products.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Topics for Essays <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the selection of "topics", poetry may be based on the subjective, but novels and scripts should focus on objective conditions. Poetry, in terms of form, is "non-grammatical." As long as it expresses the general meaning and is easy to recite, the lack of verbs and the omission of subjects do not matter. Anyway, there is no fear of readers being misunderstood. In substance, it is "non-intellectual" and should be exceptionally rich in emotion. Being based on the subjective means that the selected topic is simply due to feeling touched at the same time, regardless of the relationship between various things in the object. For example, in a poem, the previous paragraph writes about Ms. Wang’s vitality, and the next paragraph suddenly writes about Miss Sun’s innocence; or the front writes about Miss Sun’s sorrow, and the back suddenly writes about Ms. Wang’s troubles. It does not matter whether Ms. Wang and Miss Sun have a relationship, and how is the relationship: writing them together is only because the author is thinking about them at the same time, feeling that they are both lovely or pitiful. Therefore, in poetry, one often says a sentence about the moon, and another sentence about some flower or some bird; just describing the horror of狂风大雨, suddenly mentioning the courage and fierceness of the revolution. Haphazard collection ignores the concept of time and disregards local relations.</p>
<p>Novels and scripts cannot be like this. The facts written must be closely intertwined to be listed together. The so-called objectivity is to indicate the relationship between various things in the object. Therefore, the time and place of the "story" must be carefully organized. The topic does not have to form the entire story.</p>
<p>The selection of topics for essays is exactly in between these two, that is, on the one hand, it can be based on the subjective, and at the same time, it must take into account objective conditions. The facts written in essays must also be related to each other, and linked before and after, just like in novels and scripts. However, it is more tolerant; novels and scripts must have a certain "intention" and "focus" must be determined from the "structure". The various things written must be related to each other, and consistent before and after. Moreover, facts that are related to each other and consistent before and after may not be adopted: In order to be nervous, it must also be seen whether it is in line with the intention and structure. Essays do not need to determine a focus from the structure. In one article, they are not limited to expressing one opinion. As long as the facts are related to each other, it is okay to follow the wishes and write around the corner.</p>
<p>Since the various things written in essays must be linked before and after, they must be objectively examined. The facts can be adopted according to the inspiration and are not restricted by "intention" or "structure". Therefore, it can also maintain a part of the subjective relationship.</p>
<p>From what is said above, it can be seen that for the author's feelings, in poetry, every fact is directly and loosely related. In novels and scripts, the facts are closely linked to each other, and only the whole has a relationship with the author's feelings. In essays, the facts are linked sequentially, but the beginning and end are not necessarily directly related. At the same time, each part created by the collection of various things is related to the author's feelings.</p>

<p>— Yao Mu</p>
<p>—One of Brief Notes of Wandering—</p>
<p>Friend:</p>
<p>Suddenly, I woke up from a daydream.</p>
<p>Daydream—because in the dream, I was aware that it was a dream, and its disillusionment was also within my expectations. However, its brevity and its ending in the form of a nightmare were somewhat beyond what I imagined.</p>
<p>I have no regrets about the shattering of the dream; after all, daydreams are not always sweet. What I resent is its brevity—so brief that it was almost like a hallucination. I felt no panic about the transition to a nightmare, only surprise. In a real world so ordinary that it is sickening, anything with a hint of strangeness, even in a dream, is a kind of pleasure. My clever friend, do you understand this philosophy of dreams?</p>
<p>Not long ago, didn't you write to me with surprise, asking what kind of dream I was having? Friend, forgive me, I still cannot tell you. It's not because I have forgotten it completely after waking up, but because this dream is like a riddle. Once revealed, it loses all its flavor. At most, I can only tell you the riddle's surface.</p>
<p>In this dream, I am still myself, and yet not myself.</p>
<p>In this dream, I am doing things that I loathe and hate in my life. I am saying and writing words that praise the current authorities—words I am neither happy nor worthy to say and write. Like a lonely island, I am cut off from my old ideals and verification. In this sea of people around me, the faces, the attitudes in their speech, even the titles, the nouns, are all foreign to me—as foreign as another world. But I want to perform the monkey show of wearing a hat and robe; I want to be a parrot that can say "Guest, pour the tea." In the dream, I hear the curses of some friends, while at the same time I experience the flattery, admiration, and even jealousy of some irrelevant people. But to all of this, whether it is a curse or jealousy, I only offer a smile. In this dream, I do not loathe myself; I only mock my surroundings, because in these surroundings, I am not myself, and yet I am still myself at the same time.</p>
<p>Friend, perhaps you will try to apply Freud's psychoanalysis of dreams? If that's the case, you are mistaken. Contrary to Freud's philosophy of dreams, what taught me to act this way in the dream was not the "unconscious" that Freud spoke of, but precisely reason—thoroughly Kantian reason. Friend, do you feel that the more I say, the more confused you become? If I continue, I am afraid it will be like a "diamond sutra," and you will be even more clueless. But please forgive me, what I am talking about now is a dream!</p>
<p>However, I finally woke up from this dream.</p>
<p>Let me tell you some things that happened after waking up.</p>
<p>(Perhaps I am still dreaming now, but at least it is another dream). On a dark night, for some important business, I accompanied a friend to the dark riverside, where only a few dim lights flickered, and boarded a small steamboat that I had never taken before. The boat was filled with a load of working-class men and women, and then it set off. Looking back, the black, beast-like mountains were stretching their waists, and across the river, the mountains formed a crouching, dark shadow, watching us like monsters.</p>
<p>"This boat is going to the South Gate, right?" A country woman asked us repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Oh, probably." Actually, I was also clueless.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat docked, we got off, regardless of where it was. Two rickshaws carried us through the dim, quiet, straight, and narrow streets. The low shops on both sides only leaked out weak light, and the shadows of thin people dressed as workers staggered by. But I truly believed that I was walking through a dark, medieval town, not a famous city like Birmingham. After running for ten or eight miles, a small river blocked our path. I thought of the "Yin-Yang River," because behind us was a dark scene like a graveyard, and ahead of us was a display of red lights and a burst of noise, symbolizing the human world and modernity. Several "melon-skin" boats were moored by the river. We casually stepped onto one of them, and the boatman only needed to punt three times to ferry us to another world of cities.</p>
<p>Neon lights flashed past my eyes one by one, and the city's shadows gradually blurred. The steam whistle let out a cry, and the wheels moved slightly. My friend waved his hat at me. I shook off the hand of the nightmare that was pressing on my heart, and I felt certain that I was truly on the road to wandering. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e228">White Spirit Temple (Part 1) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Chenying</p>
<p>When the morning bell struck seven o'clock, I was awakened by the cold wind blowing in through the round skylight on the Mongolian yurt. The sound of the trumpet, "dudu dada," entered my ears, a magnificent sound with a hint of monotonous desolation, which made me think of the ancient people in this desolate wilderness playing gongs and drums and the magnificent scene of warhorses neighing in the wind.</p>
<p>Stretching out my legs, which had been curled up all night in the bedding, the thick camel hair quilt (note) was just like a thin winter coat, unable to keep out the cold. I looked at everyone, and it seemed that no one wanted to get up. Although someone had added charcoal to the stove in the yurt twice during the night, it had also gone out. The cool morning wind blew in from the skylight, adding to the endless coldness inside the yurt.</p>
<p>Everyone was reluctant to leave the bedding that had not been warm for a night, but they were finally called and all scrambled to get up. A young man, only sixteen or seventeen years old, wearing dirty clothes, came in to light the fire, and the yurt gradually became a little warmer.</p>
<p>Hastily wiping my face, and then drinking the boiled water that the young man brought over, the water was turbid, with a layer of grease on top, and a hint of mutton tallow in the water. Asking the young man where he came from, he said, "I came from Guihua City to serve people here, in order to earn about ten yuan a month."</p>
<p>Coming out of the Mongolian yurt with the door curtain hanging, this time I could see the entire panorama of the White Spirit Temple clearly. At the foot of the mountain on the west side was the famous Inner Mongolia sacred site—the White Spirit Temple. The interconnected temples occupied a place of about a mile long, with red walls and green tiles. In the brilliant sunlight, it was dazzling. This temple differed from the temples in Guihua in that it had many lanes allowing people to enter and exit. At this time, there were very few lamas wearing red kasayas moving around. Perhaps they were chanting scriptures in the hall?</p>
<p>The Mongolian yurt where we lived was on the northeast side of the temple, no more than a distance of about a li. Going down the slope, you could walk into the yurt. There were about seventy Mongolian yurts, scattered in all directions, each occupying a round area of about two zhang. Wooden frames were used to support them like building a house, and thick blankets were draped on top. Thick blankets were also laid on the ground. There was a square hole in the center of the dome, which served as ventilation. The iron chimney of the stove passed through here, sending out the smoke from the stove. Military tents were interspersed between the Mongolian yurts, where the Mongolian soldiers slept. Several Mongolian yurts were lined up on the slope. Walking down the slope, you might accidentally step on them.</p>
<p>In front of the Mongolian yurt was a winding small river. Although it was summer, the ice had not completely melted. Inside the river were clusters of mud houses, which the people here called "Hedong," where the Han people who did business lived. Several wisps of smoke were drifting up, and it was quiet with no one in sight. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e229">Old Servant <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Guanglue</p>
<p>Early morning.</p>
<p>Faint dawn, rippling through the window, instantly illuminating the entire room with a white, shimmering light. Mo Er, lying in bed, turned over and coughed hoarsely. As his drowsy eyes made contact with the light, his body suddenly twitched as if struck by some subconscious impulse, and he immediately jumped up.</p>
<p>Mo Er, with bleary eyes, stumbled to the hall, opened his tired, rheum-filled eyes, and looked at the clock on the wall. Seeing that the hour hand was still pointing at six, his tense, wrinkled face returned to its usual calm state.</p>
<p>"Goodness—it's still early."</p>
<p>He sighed hoarsely. His words contained two different meanings: he was thinking about his own body, getting up so early would definitely mean insufficient rest; but in order to keep his job, he couldn't afford to get up too late. These two conflicting emotions made him sad, and he sighed from time to time. After getting up, he routinely swept the hall, corridors, steps, courtyard, etc., and wiped the tables and chairs, boiled water, and made tea... He was so busy that he was panting and sweating. He was so diligent and conscientious because he was afraid of offending his master and being fired.</p>
<p>He bent over, sweeping the corridors. In the quiet morning, the peculiar gloomy atmosphere of the old house made him feel even more uncomfortable. He felt as if he were in a solemn and lonely cellar. He wiped the peeling chairs, tables, lintels, and other items that had been exposed to the air for a long time. Being amidst these signs of a ruined family, he felt an increased sense of destruction and misery, and felt even more his own aging and the dark, uncertain future of his life.</p>
<p>"Mo Er, bring the wash water!" The young master, putting on the face of his master, hummed loudly. Although the family fortune was declining day by day, the arrogant attitude of calling servants that had been passed down from ancestors still existed. Hearing the young master's call, Mo Er immediately picked up the washbasin and went to the kitchen, panting. After picking up the washbasin, the young master's voice echoed in his ears incessantly, a dark shadow flashed before his eyes, and an unspeakable ache attacked his heart. He felt as if he could offend his master at any moment, which would jeopardize his job.</p>
<p>In a life of fear and hardship, the days passed one by one. But the most terrifying day in Mo Er's mind finally arrived.</p>
<p>On this morning, Mo Er was routinely sweeping the corridor when the young master, with a worried face, walked up to him and said in a hoarse voice, "Mo... we really hate to do this, but the times are bad, the rent is not coming in, and the taxes are high. We can't afford to support the family, so please..." The young master frowned in pain, choking on his words.</p>
<p>"Young master, how can this be? I am old, I have no relatives or old friends." He was overcome with grief, and old tears streamed down his face.</p>
<p>"Here is five yuan for travel expenses. You can go for now, maybe next year the times will be better, and you can come back."</p>
<p>"I won't go, young master?"</p>
<p>"But there's nothing I can do here."</p>
<p>In the end, he had no choice but to pack his simple luggage and leave the old house where he had lived for half his life. On the dusty village road, swept by the cold wind, the old man was like a lonely camel in the desert, advancing step by step on his life's journey.</p>
<p>"The world has changed!" He wiped away his tears and wept in a hoarse voice, "I served his old man, and I served him until he grew up. Now that I am old, he tells me to get lost. What a heartless person! The world has changed, it has changed."</p>
<p>His tears streamed down again.</p>
<h3 id="e230">The Death of a Person (Part 2) <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Ya Leng was about twenty minutes away by train from this desolate dock where we were. But judging from Lao Fang's condition, he couldn't take the train; the poorly equipped train wouldn't do him any good. So, the next morning, I was assigned the task of escorting the patient to the hospital. I took the ten dollars of wages that Lao Fang had saved and the five dollars of advance payment from the boss's hand, arranged for a Malay rickshaw, and helped him with difficulty down the stairs. He sat in the rickshaw, left the pig-like boss and the pockmarked landlady, and the Singer sewing machine, and set off.</p>
<p>"Hospitals are not for the poor!" All the way, Lao Fang repeated this, showing his strange teeth and panting. "You don't understand, you little devil!... Cough, you are simply sending me to my funeral!"</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" I stopped him.</p>
<p>The rickshaw took us to the hospital gate, and it was already noon. Absorbed into that devilish building, Lao Fang lay on the bed in the third-class ward, his face turning an iron-blue, scary to look at, as if he was about to die. "Just lie quietly, don't think wildly, and you will get better." I patted his shoulder, comforting him.</p>
<p>My impression of the third-class hospital still makes me shudder when I recall it now. I don't know how many people were taken in in one large ward. The miserable sounds squeezed out of suffering filled every corner: the nurses and patients argued like enemies. There, one could often hear such shouts:</p>
<p>"Nurse! Hey, where did you go?"</p>
<p>"Bring some water, I'm dying of thirst!"</p>
<p>"Put up the frame, if you don't loosen the bandage for me, I'll do it myself. When I get old and rich, I'll see where you escape to!"</p>
<p>But the woman in white turned her head and wrinkled her nose, ignoring them and walking out.</p>
<p>When Lao Fang was relatively lucid, he saw this scene and told me, "Ah, did you see that? Little devil, only you would send me to the hospital. Do you think they will heal my illness? Heaven knows!" He sighed helplessly, looking up at the sky. The facts before my eyes pressed on my chest, making me unable to say anything. It wasn't until a full two hours later that I saw the Dutch doctor with his neatly trimmed mustache walk in with great authority. It was finally Lao Fang's turn. He put the stethoscope on his thin chest and kept shaking his head covered with red hair. The examination was over in five minutes. The nurse told me to follow the doctor to the outer office to get the admission certificate and pay for the medicine. It took so long that I almost missed the last night train. I said goodbye to the patient and returned to the store.</p>
<p>Three days later, I asked the boss to go to the hospital, but it was not allowed. "What is Lao Fang to you? He will be back soon. Don't be bewitched, go to the kitchen, it's time to cook." He said that.</p>
<p>"Boss, even though he is not related to me, he is still an employee of the store. Can't I go see him? And, he probably needs some money to be sent to him."</p>
<p>"Money? Hmph, where would he get money!"</p>
<p>Seeing his stubborn appearance, I was both angry and surprised, and felt that a money-loving merchant was truly beyond saving. I planned to collect some money from the store's employees for Lao Fang to send to the hospital. But when I happily gathered thirty dollars and was about to take the two o'clock train to him, regardless of whether the boss allowed it or not, the hospital's notice was sent to the store.</p>
<p>"What happened to Lao Fang?"</p>
<p>The employees fell silent, staring intently at the boss who was opening the paper. There wasn't even the sound of scissors. After he finished reading, he lowered his shaved, fat head. "He died this morning!" He said, his eyes fixed on the floor.</p>
<p>"It's over, use this money to buy a coffin." I said, feeling extremely sad, and I wanted to cry.</p>
<p>"Lao Fang was a truly pitiful fellow, he hasn't had a comfortable day in three years." One of his fellow villagers told me. "Do you know that he still has a wife and two children at home who all depend on him for support. Now, what do you think the widow and orphans will do!"</p>
<p>I couldn't forget him for a long time, and often when I was idle, I would think of that tall, thin man with his hunched shoulders, a kind man. He had once believed that poor people should be stronger and not get sick even for a day. This truth was proven by himself. And the landlady, who occasionally remembered that there had been a dead person in the store, always had a despicable saying on her lips:</p>
<p>"That dead ghost, speaking of it, still owes the store five dollars!"</p>

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3 id="e231">From Triplets to Encouraging Births <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the wife of a cobbler in Hedong, Tianjin, gave birth to triplets, all boys, and both mother and children were well. The street chief reported it to the Public Security Bureau for the record. The Public Security Bureau then sent people to express their condolences and deliver various kinds of pasta, etc.</p>
<p>This move by the Public Security Bureau seems to imply some meaning of encouraging births. Otherwise, giving birth to children is very common, and the authorities would definitely not send people to express their condolences or deliver food. If it is said that the authorities value it so much because it was triplets, all "boys," then that is something we dare not agree with.</p>
<p>Mentioning the matter of encouraging births, quite a few people have been advocating it recently. Mussolini of Italy and Hitler of Germany are two enthusiastic proponents. Everyone understands their intention in encouraging births, which is to encourage the people of the whole country to work for the nation and rush to create some little citizens to be used for future wars. Encouraging births has not yet been implemented in our country.</p>
<p>Our country has always boasted of its population, calling itself a large country of 400 million compatriots. It seems that there is no need to encourage births. However, this is not the case. Although our country has a large population, the number of deaths due to natural disasters and man-made disasters every year is truly astonishing. One major flood kills millions or tens of millions. One drought also kills millions or tens of millions. The number of people who sacrifice their lives under gunfire in civil wars is also impossible to count. If heaven is merciless and people are merciless, and people continue to die like this, the population of 400 million will not be difficult to turn into 300 million or 200 million in the future. This is truly worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>However, there are still problems with encouraging births in China at present, because there is a close relationship between population and food. As the population increases, the food supply must also increase accordingly. But in China today, there are many people and little food, and many people are starving. If births are further encouraged, it will definitely be impossible to support them. This is even more worth considering.</p>
<h3 id="e232">"Deaf" Old Man <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Fu</p>
<p>——One of Old Feelings——</p>
<p>This old man is an outstanding figure in our Huang Town. Speaking of him, I am afraid that there is no one who lives within thirty or fifty miles of Huang Town who does not know him. But what his real name is, where his original home is, these are things that very few people can clearly say; however, because he is old, his ears are a little deaf, and he has lived in Huang Town for a long time, so we all call him "Deaf" Old Man.</p>
<p>He has no proper occupation, nor a decent home. His residence is in the small, dilapidated temple at the end of the market street; his only way to pass the time is to beg everywhere. Although he is so old—his beard and eyebrows are completely white, and his back is already hunched—he still seems very robust: he can drink strong wine, eat a lot of food, and walk thirty or forty miles of mountain roads every day. Whether it is sunny or rainy, as soon as the east turns white, he carries his crutch, a gourd on his back, a tattered straw bag, and his inseparable yellow dog, leaves the temple gate, and heads to the neighboring villages: it is not until the sun has set that he staggers back with a slightly drunken air.</p>
<p>Although he lives the same beggar's life, he is somewhat different from other beggars: usually, he does not often bother people, but whenever someone has a wedding or other joyous event, a few days before the "auspicious day," he will come uninvited. As soon as he enters the door, without him having to say anything, the host already understands his intention. At this time, the host must take out three hundred copper coins, first put them in his straw bag, then snatch his gourd and fill it with strong, unmixed wine: in addition, he must also prepare two or three kinds of delicious dishes, put them in front of him, and greet him cordially. After the host has fulfilled these "obligations," he will take out several sheets of red paper with large characters that look like printed charms from his straw bag and hand them to the host to paste everywhere. The effect of these red papers is said to be specifically used to suppress other beggars. If you don't have these, on the day of the "auspicious day," skeleton-like beggars will come in droves to make trouble, preventing you from having a good time; because he has been doing this for a long time, and he is highly qualified, he has the magical power to drive away his later peers. However, this is just a legend passed down from the mouths of old people. Whether his magical power is actually effective has never been proven by facts. However, the farmers living in this area of Huang Bo are quite satisfied and content with their lives, and they only encounter a few major wedding days in their lifetime, so they don't care much about spending a few more coins. Therefore, the life of Deaf Old Man, who lives a parasitic life, can be sustained so comfortably.</p>
<p>A Deaf Old Man who lives a parasitic life should, in principle, be despised and disliked, but his experience is not so unfortunate. People respect him, like him; no matter who catches a glimpse of his shadow walking into the village, they will shout excitedly: "Deaf Old Man is here, Deaf Old Man is here!" At this time, the men, women, old, and young in the house will always head towards him in unison. The children, who are not very familiar with the world, always hide like shy girls when they meet strangers, but they are not afraid of Deaf Old Man. As soon as they see Deaf Old Man walking in, they surround him in groups, asking him to tell stories and talk about news; and his belly</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>also seems to have a book of stories already prepared, and the children's requests are never refused. Even if these children are so lively, he always smiles so kindly, like he is looking at his own grandchildren, patting this one on the head and that one on the head. After the stories are told, he will also have a conversation with the older generation about worldly affairs and human feelings, and talk about the fresh things he has heard and seen; and when the conversation turns to sadness, they will also sigh deeply at each other once or twice. Talking like this, he will always linger for at least an hour or two before saying goodbye and heading to another village. The old people, watching his increasingly small figure in the background, will always mutter to themselves in a daze: "He really lives a long life... really..."</p>
<p>I have been away from Huang Town for seven or eight years. In these long days, whether I am in books, on stage, on the road,... whenever I see an old man with white beard and eyebrows and a slightly hunched back, the first image that floats into my brain is always this Deaf Old Man.——This old man gave me too deep an impression! But I don't know if he is still living there now, and whether Huang Town, which he relies on for a living, still retains its old appearance!?</p>
<h3 id="e233">Dust and Sand <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>When reading Tao Yuanming's poem and reaching the lines, "Life has no roots, drifting like dust on the road," I was seized by a sudden sorrow. The hand holding the book slackened, and the scene before my eyes gradually dimmed. Pages of past life turned in my mind, savoring the verses, thinking, life is truly like dust and sand, drifting and uncertain! But this dust and sand is not the light dust on the road, but the sand and soil running with the mad wind in the boundless desolate sandy land. Have you ever seen the scene of dust and soil in the northern country? When the wind rises, grains of dust and sand piece together into a thick yellow curtain, covering the clear sky entirely. Then it flutters and drifts, some floating to the rooftops, some to the treetops, some into the flowing water. No matter where it drifts or what posture it takes, it can never escape the trick of being played with by fate. Perhaps dust and soil are ignorant, perhaps they are sad? Who knows. But their drifting is real. Without a fixed home, without a fixed destination, though it is said to be freedom, the taste of a boundless future and a boundless past is probably unimaginable to those not in such a situation. When the mad wind first rises and yellow sand obscures the sky, seeing oneself so small and powerless in mid-air, and seeing countless companions being manipulated by an irresistible force, without even the power to choose, just as one clings to a withered branch, just as one settles on a rustling blade of grass, just as one falls to the ground, and one rejoices to have escaped the devil's hand of the wind, to rest one's weary life, to see again the beauty of the clear and harmonious world, suddenly another gust of wind rises, dragging one's heavy body towards an uncertain long journey without even time to breathe, so one stops again, is scattered again, without end, until this dust and sand clings to the window lattice of a certain house, or hides in a relatively quiet place, but after a short time of wind and rain, it melts, dissipates, and expires. From birth, it drifts and is unsettled, the entire life spent in the invasion of wind, frost, rain, and snow, such is the life of a grain of dust and sand. But how can such a life be so surprisingly similar to mine? You strange dust and sand, uncertain dust and sand, dust and sand played with by others!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, my eyes gradually closed.</p>
<p>I remember that in Turgenev's novel, he described a person with a weak will, saying, "I am like a stone rolling down a mountain, unable to stop myself." The dust and sand that I speak of that cannot stop itself is just like this. Every day, as I stroll back from the streets, facing the bustling traffic, I can't help but have a fantasy. I think that the people around me, before, behind, left, and right, are just like many grains of dust and sand around a grain of dust and sand, propelled by some force, involuntarily vying in the arena of fame and gain. Moreover, this wind blows ceaselessly, letting you flutter, toss, until you no longer have the strength to float with the wind, then you quietly fall from mid-air, and another layer of dust and sand buries you. In this environment, how small must one's strength appear?</p>
<p>Living in this world is truly an extremely heavy corvée; you must walk even if you cannot, and you must rouse yourself again when you stop. Even if you stumble and fall from exhaustion, you must pant and climb up, and then run towards the endless future. The power of the wind is too great. When will we be able to cling to a blade of grass, alongside a lively stream, and have a comfortable and beautiful dream? When will we be able to set aside our heavy burden and restore our healthy energy? On this long and obstructed journey, the traveler is too tired to endure.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Metropolitan Night Scene <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>If I were to take on the guise of a novelty seeker, with a taste for the exotic, stepping lightly in the evening breeze of a June twilight, to drift into the heart of the metropolis! That would easily elicit my admiration. For someone like me, not intimately familiar with the city, would I dare to deny everything admirable in the metropolis? Thus, I softly admired it in my heart, though I dared not let my voice of admiration attract attention.</p>
<p>I cultivated an air of elegance, strolling along the cement sidewalks. I bathed in the enchanting light of red and green neon lights. If I were prone to illusions, I would suspect that I had wandered into a witch's night garden, where thousands of strange and precious flowers all emitted light in the darkness, turning their colors into radiant beams. This could easily stir the heart of a man of upright and serene disposition, causing it to deviate from its orbit like a rogue planet, willing to dissolve in the seductive power of those enchanting lights! However, even if I had momentarily entertained the courage to try such a thing, it was only a fleeting thought, extinguished by my emotion of loathing. Even with the distinct types of female bodies, wrapped in a thin layer of what seemed like faint moonlight-like gauze, broadcasting the brilliance of flesh and the exotic fragrance of flesh, evenly distributed to every passerby. Interpreting this from the perspective of those floating female bodies, one feels that this unreserved display of their physical appearance possesses a unique charm. (However, this interpretation does not include the opportunity for anyone to enjoy their beauty. If, however, you are someone with a higher status and more money than them, then my explanation above will lose its effect.) Naturally, these troupes of female bodies conforming to the classical beauty of Greece paraded one by one through the night streets of the metropolis, further employing charming and graceful postures, and eyes seemingly filled with ardent tenderness, most capable of making young men with few bills in their pockets melancholic, but even more capable of arousing in stout and portly gentlemen an uncontrollable aesthetic interest. And this aesthetic interest often becomes a reality because they have many bills, enough to help it come to fruition. Thus, those seductive female bodies quickly slip into the gentleman's Studebaker car and soon appear in the rapidly playing melodies of the Gotische music, gracefully dancing on the smooth glass floor!</p>
<p>The metropolis is in motion, with mechanical motion and irregular motion. However, on the night streets of the metropolis, the speed of motion is intensified, the scope of motion is expanded, and the types of motion are even more complex. If you still have some patience, you can see steel wheels biting the rails, rubber wheels biting the asphalt road, neon lights biting the hearts of those wanting to go home, the brilliance of young ladies' beautiful bodies biting the desires of affectionate men, and the cheap sexual functions of street nightingales biting the interests of those sexually deprived. Thus, the night scenes of the metropolis are rendered in extremely thick paint. (If I am still a skilled speaker, then I would not say that sin serves as an important ingredient in these extremely thick paints!)</p>
<p>However, due to the difference between my interests and those of others, the metropolitan night scene injected me with a large dose of melancholy! Indeed, the power of capitalism is now sufficient to construct the magnificent appearance of the human world. However, I believe that what destroys the magnificent appearance of the human world is still capitalism itself. Not only is it futile, but it is also superfluous. Thus, I suspect that the melancholy tune of my whistle is singing a funeral song for this century.</p>

<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>A simple bedroom, with only a wooden plank bed, a pile of old bedding and a few worn-out clothes scattered on it. In the corner, a child was sleeping. Two stools were casually placed beside the bed. An old half-table was placed in front of the window, but a Western-style stove nearby was not lit. The whitewash on the surrounding walls had all turned blackish-gray. The air in the room was deathly still and terrifying. At that time, Pinghua was sitting at the old half-table by the window, picking up a pen to write a letter to a cousin, asking him to find him a job in Hankou, but when he thought of his cousin's snobbish face, and the insults that Yunqian had suffered when she visited his home last time, he tore the eight-line letter paper on which he had just written two lines to shreds, and scraps of paper flew all over the floor. He suddenly grabbed his hair with both hands desperately, and a pair of lifeless eyeballs stared out the window, watching several small sparrows perching on the electric wire, preening their wings, hunger and grief intertwined in his mind!</p>
<p>"Ah!" With a sound, the child woke up on the bed, and Yunqian hurriedly picked him up from the pile of broken quilts. That green, one-year-old child was also so thin that he only had a piece of skin left. Even when he cried, there were only those weak twitchings and low voices. His neck was thin and soft, truly like a dying child.</p>
<p>"Child... you were born with... a bitter fate, so... you were cast into... such... a mommy and daddy..." As she spoke, two lines of bitter tears surged like a mountain torrent, and the tears fell from her face onto the child's cheek. She looked at the child, pressed a tear-soaked, thin face tightly against the child's face, but the child still cried vigorously. "Child... Mom's milk is dry. Child! Mom has no food to eat, so where is there milk for you to eat!"</p>
<p>He glanced sadly at the child and his wife, thinking: they are truly suffering. Since Yunqian married me,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>she hasn't had a single day of peace. Less than a year after our marriage, I lost my job, and now there's another child. For nearly a year of unemployment, everything that could be pawned has been pawned, and everything that could be sold has been sold. Now there's nothing left that's worth anything. I've been running around everywhere, and I've been to almost all the relatives and friends' places, but the result has only been cold insults and contemptuous mockery! But since I can't find a job and I have nowhere to borrow money, how can I continue to survive? Just this three-story attic we live in costs four yuan a month in rent. We're already three months behind, and the landlord's face is not as kind as before. I can see that he's about to issue an eviction order soon. But our stomachs haven't had a good meal in two days, and now we really can't bear it anymore. The clear water in our chests just bubbles straight up, and that sour and sweet taste is harder to bear than anything!</p>
<p>"Tch! This... this snobbish world!" He slammed the table hatefully.</p>
<p>"The day before yesterday, I saw an advertisement in the newspaper for female clerks, and I tried it out. Their qualifications for the exam were just beauty in appearance and youth, so the result of my test was said to be passing, but today I received their notice saying that they still need a 200 yuan guarantee..." Yunqian thought of the exam she took the other day and couldn't help but feel angry. Then she threw a crumpled letter in front of Pinghua!</p>
<p>"These are all swindlers!" Pinghua grabbed the letter and tore it up.</p>
<p>The two were silent again, and sorrow and pain pressed tightly in the room. The child's crying also stopped at some point.</p>
<p>"Ping, I still want to go to the employment agency and ask if anyone wants to hire a wet nurse or nanny. Let me do it and see if it will maintain our current life. Anyway, poor people don't need to care about face anymore. Even their lives can't be guaranteed!" She said a string of words, followed by two long strings of tears, but she still wanted to force a smile so that Pinghua wouldn't be too sad!</p>
<p>"But what about the child?" Pinghua couldn't help crying either. He suddenly hugged Yunqian and pressed his face against her disheveled hair: "Yun, you've suffered. How can I let you suffer such humiliation?"</p>
<p>"I think we should send the child to the orphanage! On the one hand, it will preserve his little life, and at the same time, you and I can find some odd jobs to do."</p>
<p>"Yun!" He looked at her with tears in his eyes and cried out, but couldn't say a word of comfort.</p>
<p>"Ping! What's wrong?" She sadly wiped away his tears, forgetting the hunger in her stomach from not eating for two days. Only pain and sorrow occupied them both.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Opera Company, which has long been famous in the broadcasting world, was rumored to be dissolved some time ago. After investigation by all parties, it is completely inconsistent with the facts. Since its establishment last year, the company has been headed by Liu Hengzhi as the president, and the company's affairs have also been presided over by him alone. Now, in order to make the group organization more solid and seek the development of the company's affairs, Mr. Liu specially invited Yan Hua, the former leader of Xinhua News Agency, and others to jointly establish the Shanghai Opera Company's Board of Directors as the company's basic organization. Liu Hengzhi, Wang Yintai, Xu Jinxian, Yan Deyi, and Yan Hua serve as directors. Yesterday, the inaugural meeting of the Board of Directors was held at the Xinxin Company Broadcasting Station. All directors attended and performed the ceremony as scheduled. The organization regulations of the Board of Directors and the company's articles of association were immediately passed. Subsequently, Xu Jinxian was elected as the chairman of the board, and many proposals for the company's affairs were discussed. Yan Hua and Liu Hengzhi have now been officially hired by the Board of Directors as the company's principal and vice leaders, responsible for researching all artistic development matters. Wang Yintai and Yan Deyi were hired as the principal and vice directors of the General Affairs Department, responsible for studying all company affairs. Ms. Zhang Wen was also hired as the music conductor, and the company address was set at No. 19, Qingdao Road, this port. At a specified time every day, the staff is gathered to intensify training. It is heard that the company will formally solicit members and first give them considerable training? Once the training is mature, it is planned to hold a large-scale opera performance on stage.</p>
<p>The Broadcasting World semi-monthly publication, published and distributed by the Broadcasting World Publishing House, No. 71, Lane 353, Xinzha Road, this port, the inaugural issue has been published on the 10th. The publication is edited by Fan Songyao, with wonderful and insightful content, and has many photos of broadcasting musicians, all in color and finely printed. The publication is a good companion for those who own radios. The retail price is five cents per copy. All magazine companies and newspaper vendors sell it. It is also heard that the company now plans to solicit 5,000 basic subscribers. The annual cost, including postage, is only one yuan and a corner.</p>

<p>Bu Wancang, the director of Yi Hua, is good at socializing and has many foreign friends. Yesterday, when he was directing a rural housing scene for his film "Triumphant Song," four or five of his foreign friends came to visit.</p>
<p>Wu Weiyun, the cinematographer for "The Storm," is fond of stage shows. Recently, he often goes to the Hebei Theater alone during his breaks from work.</p>
<p>In "Hero of the Times," there is a dog performance scene. Directors Ying Yunwei and Qin Tong, who have two well-trained and understanding dogs, were specially requested to lend them. On the day of filming, Qin Tong and his son brought each dog to the company. In front of everyone, they demonstrated the usual training they gave the dogs, instructing them to perform for everyone. He told the dog to sit on a sofa and bow to everyone. The dog actually sat very properly and bowed to everyone. Qin Tong did not tell it to stop, and it dared not stop. It seems Qin Tong put a lot of effort into training this dog.</p>
<p>The interior scenes for "The Storm" will be filmed after a large set from the International Grand Theater is completed, then they will go to Qingdao to shoot exterior scenes.</p>
<p>"At the Beginning of Life" has been showing at the Jincheng Grand Theater since the fifth. In those five days, the total number of viewers was 22,571, with an average of more than 4,500 people watching each day.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun will shine in "The Storm."</p>

<p>Shi Chao—one of Diantong's "newcomers." He is from Beiping, and one of the male leads in "Goddess of Freedom." He has a handsome and pretty face, fluent Mandarin, and a cheerful demeanor. Upon meeting him, you will feel his humble and amiable manners, and his warm and sincere friendship. If you spend a long time with him, he will also joke around with you.</p>
<p>He has excellent mimicking skills. He can cleverly imitate Manager Ma Dejian's attitude and Factory Director Situ Yimin's seriousness. He can even imitate the unique postures of foreign movie stars such as Paul Muni and Wallace Beery perfectly. When he arrives at the film set, the atmosphere becomes lively. He constantly makes melodious sounds from his mouth, singing and humming tunes. At the same time, he can also stir up interest on the basketball court. The Diantong basketball team is well-organized, and he can be said to be one of the most influential members. After each game, his analysis of the game and the players' experiences always lead to significant improvements.</p>

<p>The production of Lianhua's sound films is something that film enthusiasts and the entire film industry are extremely concerned about. Precisely because of this, Lianhua must be particularly cautious about the production of sound films. At the same time, Lianhua's colleagues have a kind of ambition for sound film production: "If we don't make a sound, we will startle the world with a single sound." Therefore, sufficient time must be allowed for the preparation of the script.</p>
<p>However, although Lianhua's sound films have not yet been produced, Lianhua's sound film recording equipment has already begun working. All the music and sound effects for "Carefree Gentleman" were recorded by their own recording equipment. The clarity and loudness of the sound have been proven by facts, so there is no need to elaborate further.</p>
<p>However, that was only the first trial. We believe that the results of "Autumn Fan and Bright Lamp," which is currently in preparation for sound design, will definitely be even more perfect, without any doubt.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Tan Chang has been in the United States for more than ten years, and has served as a sound engineer at the Victor Talking Machine Company. After returning to China, he is now employed by the Lianhua General Film Studio as the chief sound engineer. The sound equipment recently purchased by Lianhua from the United States has been tested by him and has achieved excellent results. The photo on the left is of Mr. Chen.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Hospital Design in Modern Architecture <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>At 8 PM on June 6th, the Hong Kong University Alumni Association of this port held a meeting at the Bankers Club. Many famous figures from China and abroad attended. Marquis G. G. Cihadini Cesi, Secretary of the Italian Embassy, also spared time to attend. Mr. Wang Daoan presided over the meeting and specially invited Mr. CHelazzi to give a lecture on "Hospital Design in Modern Architecture." He explained in detail the new plans for hospital construction. Mr. Chelazzi is a famous architect who recently won the design competition for the British Concession Bureau Hospital in Tianjin. This lecture will surely make a significant contribution to the modern architectural world. The original manuscript of the speech is translated into Chinese and disclosed below:</p>
<p>If someone asks me to define modern architecture, I can say without hesitation that modern architecture must contain the following balances:</p>
<p>(1) Balance of lines and colors—creating beauty with simplicity and unadornment.</p>
<p>(2) Balance of interior and exterior—the exterior should evoke pleasure, while the interior should be practical.</p>
<p>(3) Balance of light and shadow—fully utilizing light when it is beneficial, while providing a barrier when it is harmful.</p>
<p>(4) Balance of ventilation—ensuring sufficient circulation of wind and air when needed.</p>
<p>Modern architecture not only focuses on the surface appearance, but also seeks utilization in all aspects with creative art. Therefore, modern hospital architecture uses new methods to provide comfort and convenience.</p>
<p>Taking the Tianjin British Concession Hospital that I designed as an example, it is designed based on simplicity, order, straightforwardness, and aerodynamics. In recent years, China has indeed made great progress in construction, but the construction of hospitals—especially in the interior—is urgently needed. When planning a hospital in China, in addition to common problems, one must also consider the local conditions. In my personal opinion, the most important thing is the climate. In winter, the wind direction in Tianjin is north and northwest, and in summer it is southeast. Therefore, I placed the wards in the south and the working areas in the north. In this way, the wards have sufficient air circulation in the summer and are not attacked by the cold north wind in all seasons. As for sunlight, I placed the wards in such a position that they can fully benefit from the sunlight. The wards are connected to balconies, so they can block the hot summer sun, while the winter sun can shine into the balcony without obstruction.</p>
<p>According to thirty years of records, the average minimum temperature in Tianjin is 2.92 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest is four degrees below zero. Therefore, I think it is best to set the indoor temperature at 66 degrees. In order to reduce heat transfer through the outer walls, the outer walls are constructed with a layer of six-inch hollow bricks, a layer of four-inch hollow tiles, with a five-inch air layer in between. In order to further reduce heat loss, the windows are constructed with double layers and balanced frames. The advantage of this type of window is that it can be opened as much as possible, and there are no vertical bars, so light can penetrate more fully.</p>
<p>In addition to the hospital itself, there are also nurses' residences, manager's residences, and doctor's residences, all built in another part, not connected to the hospital. The servants' residences are in the west. The morgue is in the southwest, with a separate entrance.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the scenery around the hospital deserves special attention. Trees, lawns, green sidewalks, fountains, ponds, and seats are all very necessary.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, hospital buildings should be concentrated in one place, because the land occupied and the expenses incurred are more economical than if they are scattered.</p>
<p>Each floor of the ward is equipped with a sliding door, leading to a soiled linen chute. All soiled linen is collected in this chute and transported directly to the laundry room on the ground floor. After the soiled linen is washed, it is placed in a linen delivery room near the elevator and directly distributed to the linen storage rooms on each floor. Each floor also has a garbage chute, which leads directly to the incinerator for incineration. The kitchen is on the top floor, because experience tells us that if the kitchen is below, the smell will be very harmful to patients, even if all methods are exhausted to avoid it.</p>
<p>The operating room is designed in the north, so that the operating table can receive very even light during the day. Air circulation and heating are a very serious issue. After careful research, it was decided to use a separate heating and cooling system, first disinfecting the air with heat, then cooling it to the appropriate temperature and sending it to each operating room.</p>
<p>In short, the design of modern hospitals includes many engineering and architectural problems, which are becoming increasingly complex with the advancement of medicine. Those engaged in this design work should regard their work as sacred, because they may also be indirect tools for benefiting mankind.</p>

<p>— Liu Zhongchao</p>
<p>Currently, the construction of two- or three-story lane houses with two buildings has been reduced. The latest style popular on the market is the two- or three-story, two-section style. The characteristic is to deepen the living room on the ground floor by five or six feet, and divide it into front and rear rooms with a false door. The rear room can also be used as a dining room. The height of the rooms is reduced by about one foot compared to before. The space at the top of the building is used as a storage room, which is very convenient for living. However, the rent is one-tenth or one-fifth more expensive than the ordinary style. Two-story houses rent for 60 or 70 yuan a month, and three-story houses rent for about 90 yuan. It is only suitable for the middle class, and the lower middle class cannot enjoy it. Moreover, once old-style lane houses or houses with large gardens are demolished, they are rebuilt into new styles. If this continues, there will inevitably be an oversupply of houses, and the lower middle class who now live in old-style lane houses will inevitably experience panic in the future. Even now, looking at the advertisements for rent and rent reduction in the newspapers, it can be seen that it is gradually declining. Therefore, there is still a need for reform in future styles. Judging from the current situation, there are roughly two methods. One is to abolish the front patio, and retract the second and third floors by six or seven feet, so that the distance from the front lane houses can still maintain the current width. The distance on the ground floor seems too close. If the roof surface let out by the upper floors is converted into a glass roof, the light and air will still not be affected. Now, many lane houses, and many are new styles, do not have patios, but only have a door sleeve to reach the lane. Also, Su and Guang tailor shops in the lane often build a glass top on the patio. The two can be the model for the above style. The other is to shrink the entire house into a small residence. Taking independent villas as an example, the newly built ones, such as those on Fulu Li Road, Yuyuan Road, and the downtown area, are mostly small villas. If there were large villas like those on Julu Road, investors would never build them. It can be seen that lane houses have a trend to shrink. As for interior and exterior decoration and equipment, there is also a trend towards simplicity, because the existing spatial lane houses are mostly rich and gorgeous. The newly built independent villas are mostly flat-topped and three-dimensional, and the pointed-topped ones are in the Spanish style. This style saves labor and materials, and is also very beautiful, and is welcomed by people, so it can be popular. The trend of apartment buildings is roughly that small-scale ones (including six or eight houses) have a very large capacity and room area, and the decoration and equipment are also rich and luxurious, extremely extravagant, such as the recently built Grosvenor apt and Ostrid apt on Myers Road and the apartment at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Haig. This is because the history of apartments in Shanghai is only more than ten years, and most of them were built in the last three or five years, and are mostly new styles. Because of their comfort, convenience, and safety, they are very popular among the rich—especially foreigners. Therefore, in large apartments, the capacity of each house is increased and the number is reduced, in order to facilitate rental. For example, the newly built Yue Tuck apt on Difeng Road has twelve large houses and fourteen small houses. The large houses are all rented out, and most of the small houses cannot be rented out. It can be seen that as long as it is large, even if the rent is high, it will not affect it, just like the increasingly strange architecture of Shanghai's dance halls and cinemas a few years ago. As for the future trend, it will inevitably be the same as lane houses or independent villas. (The above description is limited to city houses. Private self-built residences are not included in this example.)</p>

<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>——Regarding Usage on the Construction Site——</p>
<p>Hinges—In our country, which is loudly advocating domestic products, the monthly import of foreign goods that flood the market is truly astonishing, especially in the construction industry. For example, the hinges (Butt or Hinge) used on construction sites are mostly imported products (it can be said that there are no domestic products). They are metal objects with a rotating property that are essential for doors or windows, with two connected parts. Some elaborate ones have springs. (Writing this, I report a gratifying piece of news, that Chinese people can also make iron windows and iron doors that are more elaborate in construction.)</p>
<p>Bolts—Bolts are used to prevent doors or windows from suddenly opening and closing due to strong winds. They are also imported products. There is a type called French bolts, which can be closed at the top and bottom of the door or window, with a rotating handle in the middle.</p>
<p>Baskets—What is most difficult to eliminate on the construction site is garbage. It is difficult to become a construction site without garbage, because the amount of garbage is transformed from sawdust, shavings, and cement chips that have been removed from the cement casing. However, to clear the garbage, it is necessary to use small workers (the head is called a small worker). The small worker must use a broom and a basket. This basket is used to carry any unusable waste.</p>
<p>Rope for the Basket—This is the rope that is used to wear the basket.</p>
<p>Pole for the Basket—This is the carrying pole for the basket, which is made of thick bamboo.</p>
<p>Sawdust—The wood that is sawed off the wood with a saw is called sawdust.</p>
<p>Shavings—The wood that is planed off the wood with a plane is called shavings.</p>
<p>Wood Scraps—When using a copper stick to pry a shell plate, the broken pieces of wood are called wood scraps. Regarding wood scraps, sawdust, and shavings, there are people who specialize in this business on the construction site who come to bargain and sell them. This is the utilization of waste on the construction site. For construction sites with relatively large projects, the income from the transaction of these three is considerable. There are also people on the construction site who come to buy empty cement bags and unused scrap iron (detailed above).</p>
<p>Steel Bar—Steel bars (Steel Stice) are the most widely used tools on the construction site, such as for prying shell plates, pulling out wire nails, and carrying heavy objects.</p>
<p>Dormer Window—Ordinary lane houses or street houses were originally built as two-story styles, but the second landlord hopes to produce more rent, so regardless of whether the third tenant is comfortable, he builds a loft on the original two stories, which becomes three stories, but the air is inevitably suffocating. The second landlord opens a skylight (Sky Light) on the roof, or builds a small house like a roof with "one side leaking water." This is the dormer window. As for the word "tiger," it probably refers to the position of the window, which resembles the tiger's big mouth, hence the name.</p>
<p>"One Side Leaking Water"—This sentence "one side leaking water" is also a habitual phrase spoken by many workers on the construction site. It means that only one side of the position leaks rain, and leaking water is another name for water seepage.</p>
<p>Old Steward—If someone wants to visit a friend on the construction site, or needs to find someone to help with a certain matter, then what you see on the construction site are many mud workers and carpenters, but of course you cannot call them workers, or randomly call them names like "Hey you" because most of the workers are ignorant. You must give them some small advantages, so you might as well call the workers "Old Steward." In fact, the three words "Old Steward" can be applied on the construction site from the foreman and boss down to the small "student" apprentices, and is not necessarily limited to the workers who do the knocking and fiddling.</p>
<p>Partition—The meaning of partition is a partition made of tongue-and-groove boards or other boards such as Jian Song boards. For example, in ordinary lane houses or street houses, the living room or floor is divided into two with a partition. The former is called the front living room front floor, and the latter is called the back living room back floor. This type of partition is most often used in small inns for small, pigeon-cage-like rooms.</p>
<p>Curb Stone—The edge of the sidewalk on the road is inlaid with stone material, which is the curb stone. The first hand procedure for the end of the house is based on the height of the curb stone or the back of the road as the standard for the height of the foundation of the house, so the curb stone (Curt) or the back of the road has become the first gate for starting construction on the construction site.
