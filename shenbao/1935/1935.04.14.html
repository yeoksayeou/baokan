<p>斯特里　　斯特里薩大會之最後會議今晨九時半間幕、各代表成欲迅速完成其討論、俾於今日午後起程赴日內瓦、今日議程甚為完全、計有（一）德國復入國聯、（二）奧保匈三國重嚴軍備問題、此事與捷克、羅馬尼亞、及南斯拉夫、二小協約國至有關係、（三）中歐公約連奧國地位在內、德元首希特勒旣允加入東歐公約、英代表大為興奮今日將竭力勸令德國重入歐洲協調之中、至於法國準備星期一日在國聯行政院中示威反對德國重整軍備之决定一層、可不介意也、法國人士對於希特勒之决計參加東歐公約、表小疑念、但信任國聯示威之效力、蓋法人希望得英意之援助、創立一種機關、能於將來條約續被破壞時以財政與經濟上封鎖加諸德國也、意國固可贊成法國主張、但英國以德國不就範為慮、仍不欲與聞也、衆料國聯行政院將以此事交委員會審查、而其結果或為此問題之擱置耳、據今日消息、意國不久將向德國提出不干涉奧事之具體辦法、德國對此已允加以考慮、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>斯特里隡　綜觀英法意三國會議結果、其對德者可歸納如次、卽德國已經實行之破壞凡爾賽和約之行為、將由國聯行政院根據法國之申請、予以紀錄、此外卽不為已甚、至問題本身則由英國負責再與德談判、此其一、至於將來、如再有片面廢約事件發生、則關係國决行經濟制裁、此其二、此項折衷辦法、聞為英外交之成功云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據斯特里隡今日電傳法國所擬向國聯提出反對德國重整軍備之决議案內容、其中除對德國之行動作道德上譴責外、並建議設三人委員會、籌商用經濟與財政之制裁防杜續有片面否認條約、動之妥善方法、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>斯特萊薩　英法推意相墨索里尼於四月底以前發出請柬、於五月中在意舉行多瑙河國家會議、會議地點尚未確定、大致當在羅馬、奧國之四鄰如德·匈·捷克·南斯拉夫·及法意等國、均參加會議、羅馬尼亞及波蘭之參加問題亦在計議中、此會議之宗旨在於簽訂保奧獨立之具體協定、至於締結多腦河公約亦有可能、英國決定贊成法意對奧政策後、遂决定召集此項新會議、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）與中歐公約有關之列強將於五月二十日集議於羅馬、此為今晨在斯特里薩法意兩國代表會議所决定事項之一、屆時法·意·奧·德·波·匈·與小恊約國皆將派員參加、今晨談話、所涉頗廣、午後四時將繼續討論意相墨索里尼今晨主張奧匈保三國重置軍備、英國雖表同情、但法外長賴伐爾力言此‘種重要事件食促議决之危險、衆信英法意不久將發表文吿、重行嚴明不能容許外人干涉奧事、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>斯特里薩　斯特里隡會議已獲切實之效果如下、</p>
<p>（一）德國現願加入東歐公約、縱簽約國之數國另訂互助協定、及在另一文件中紀錄之、</p>
<p>（二）法意决訂簡短之恊定、擔保奧國獨立、</p>
<p>（三）英意允贊助法國向國辯申訴德國實行强迫軍役事、</p>
<p>（四）英國現再努力勸喻德國重返國聯、德國之願參加東歐公約、乃由英外相西門於昨日下午會議中宣布、其他代表聞之、驚喜交集、此訊乃由德外長牛賴特轉請柏林英大使轉電達西門者、西門宣布此訊時、並稱、英國對歐洲大局作任何决議之前、願與德國再行接洽、</p>
<p>柏林現謂德政府此舉、乃因其他各國均同有好意之表示、故德國乃作此大讓步、衆料德國之變更態度、將發生深切之影響、不特及於斯特里薩會議之結果、日及於歐洲之全局、德國之决議、尤為波蘭政府所歡迎、蓋法俄兩國前於原則上商妥、如德波拒絕參加東歐公約、則法俄當自訂協定、波蘭處此、大有左右為難之勢、德國今旣不反對法俄協約、則波蘭更無理由厭惡之也、</p>
<p>會議中另一重要結果、為法意兩國决訂簡短恊約、保障奧國之獨立、希特　已表示願研究該約、</p>
<p>同時英國　再努力邀德重返國聯、衆亦視為會議重大結果之一、會議將於今日閉幕、</p>
<p>意英兩國現允費　法國向國聯中訴德國違背凡爾賽和約軍事條文之舉、聞反對德國行動之决議案、將由國聯行政院起草、法國代表曾將法政府申訴之理由詳吿意英代表、意英代表後乃有此决議、諸代表之意見、在日內瓦提出之最後决議案應規定由國聯密切研究阻止續有以片面行動否認條約義務之方法、關於制裁問題、諸代表未商得同意會議並商决繼續研究天空公約、並切實聲明英意兩國之地位</p>
<p>衆料今須舉行一包羅有關係諾國之大會議、據外間紛紛謠傳此會或將在倫敦舉行、此會將制定西門所述及兩種條約之基礎此兩約將容國聯會員國連德美日在內律加入、</p>
<p>據法國正式文吿稱、英法意三國鑒於德國之重整軍備、一致决議歐洲安全之組織、必須加以鞏固、聞法國之計劃業經籌備、不日卽將運用、意國亦準備照樣辦理云、、</p>
<p>據現象觀之、會議延至星期日、亦非不可能事、蓋軍縮問題與德國重返國聯事現尚未討論及之也、此外最後公報之起草委員會、尚有許多工作未了也、</p>
<p>聞准許奧匃保三國重整軍備事、亦曾議及、惟諸代表對此問題並未深入、意相墨索里尼贊同三國軍備之任何擴張、終須視小協約國（捷克羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫）之態度為決、聞德國加入樂歐公約所提出之唯一條件為兩種公約須完全分開、不得併為一種文件、一卽東歐互不侵略公約、一為單獨與補助互助公約、由願意締結之各國互訂之、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>斯特里薩　法國遞交國聯之備忘錄論調已和緩蓋欲迎合德國之新態度也英國發言人宣稱、英法意三國現已成立一般協定如下、（一）三國對於德國特殊的單獨廢棄和約採取之態度、（二）對於將來單獨廢棄和約中軍事條文應有對付辦法、昨晨開會時法國代表團公佈德國軍備之秘密報吿、佛蘭亭總理並鄭重表示法國對於安全之關切與應有之準備、但聞德國旣有新表示、今後會議或將完全採取新途徑云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>斯特里薩　哈瓦斯社駐斯德萊柴特派員、相信斯德萊柴會議現已達到預定之目標、至本星期六日卽可正式閉幕、三國政府已一致决定、對於法國政府為德國重整軍備一事、向國聯會行政院提出之申請、三國應保持述帶　係、此外三國代表一致主張歐洲安全組織、應增厚其力量、法國已首先創議、增强安全組織之方法、在短時期內當可獲得良好結果、意國亦準備取同樣之途徑、惟英國則取為較保留之熊度、英國意見以為如不與德國再度磋商、使德國政府領袖表示負責、則實質上之進步、恐不易達到、但此種磋商、不必定須另行召集會議、而由德國參加其問、總之英國當負責進行與德國舉行磋商、惟各國政府問、現在進行中關於建立補充安全制度之談判、則仍可照常進行、絕不因對德磋商、而稍受阻礙、此後數星期中預定之外交程序、因此亦不至有所變更云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>昨日外長牛拉脫通知英國駐德大使、謂德國準備加入東歐互不侵犯條約云、由此可見德國對於東歐公約現已改變其原來之態度、此項消息係從外國方面傳出、此問政界人士聞之、頗轟動一時、惟德國之確實態度、則尚所未悉、昨日英國駐德代表牛頓會見牛拉脫時、曾面詢如他國訂結束歐互助公約、則德國將取何種態度、當經牛拉脫與希特勒磋商後、答稱、德國對於訂結束歐互助公約、仍認為不合時宜、惟德國雖反對互助公約、却仍不妨簽訂東歐互不侵犯公約云、（十三日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國之决議參加東歐公約、就西門艾登近聘問柏林時德代表所表示之意見觀之、實為一大進步、據倫敦負責方面聲稱當時德代表表示主張多邊公約、而不含有隨意選擇的担保、德國新决議之重大意義、實在同意於隨意選擇的担保、其意見之變史、或將有重要後果也、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據此間多數觀察家之意見、德國準備參加東歐互不侵略公約、於各事無甚大之裨補、彼等現信惟德國參加互助公約、始有價值但德國旣願簽定互不侵略公約、亦足表示其願與其他各國合作云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>斯特里隡　關於德國政府準備簽訂東歐互不侵犯公約一事、此間若干人士、以爲德國態度已有變更、願與他國重新合作、多數人士則以爲德國此種作法、並無眞實價值、茍非簽訂互助公約、仍於實際無補、所謂互不侵犯公約、僅將原來已有之約束、如凱洛克非戰公約之類重行加以聲明而已、德國意思究欲如何、當由英國政府加以查詢、法國外長賴伐爾不待查詢結果、仍當按照預定日期前往莫斯科、以便簽訂法俄恊定、此項恊定大綱、業在巴黎商妥、日內賴伐爾前往日內瓦參加國聯會行政院非常會議時、當會同蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫加以確定、斯特里薩會議最後一次所討論者、乃西歐天空公約計畫、尤注重英意兩國空軍互助辦法、幷定於本日結束工作、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於斯特里隡會議、各報所得印象、可以泰晤士報之論調代表之、其言曰、歐洲各國、自覺感受威脅者、業由此次會議促其團結一致、而各國樂覩德國重返國聯會之願望、與夫一線希望尚存、各國仍當致力於此之意志、亦由此次會議表現之、每日郵報以為斯特里薩會議、係另一擴大範圍而容納德國參加之會議之先聲、每日電聞報謂、英國政策所常顧慮者、乃德國重返國聯會一事、該報並引述德國元首希特勒所提出重返國聯會之交換條件、卽索還戰前殖民地或接受委任以統治之、此外西門外相昨日會在斯德萊柴會議聲言、德國準備參加東北歐洲互不侵犯公約、各報所發表之意見、可以每日電聞報之論調代表之、該報謂、德國所提議之互不侵犯公約、所可紛予之安全保障、以視國聯會盟約所已給予者、相差甚大、特法俄捷克三國正在進行中之東歐互助公約未可視為德國參加和平組織工作之障礙、已由該國承認之矣云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）柏林午報登載駐斯特里薩訪員所撰一文、謂『英法意三國會議、實為重要之國際會議蓋自一九一四年以來、惟斯特里薩會議、方可稱為眞正之「和會」、簽訂凡爾賽和約之三大國、在實際上已承認德國之軍備權平等、至於英·法·意三國、對於申請國聯會行政院一事、成立妥協、則不過就已經過去之事、相互和解以敷衍門面而已』云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>斯特里薩　日英法意三國會議、討論中歐各國重整軍備問題、由意相墨索里尼、向英法兩國代表陳述、謂奧國陸軍現有軍額、不過三萬人、對於其領士獨立及政治完整、殊多危險、且德國旣已非法重整軍備、而仍令德國之鄰邦解除軍備、亦似有未當云、法國外長賴伐爾繼起發言、謂中歐諸國重整軍備、如忽遽决定、則殊多後患、蓋小協商諸國、見其毘鄰之奧匈保三國、重整軍備、不免有所惶恐、且目前中歐各國勢力互相均衡、非預先有所佈置、不宜使此種均勢、一旦破壞、如未至適當時機、而遽行决定重整軍備、則勢必使中歐各國相驚伯有、總之維持和平、為第一要事、故有關各國、無論其為前同盟國、或前敵國、非經共同商定、不宜採取此種途徑云、最後三國會議决定、此項問題不能在斯特里薩會議中解决、當於日後另行設法以解决之、本日午後會議將專事討論天空公約問題、此外本日會議並將考慮由意大利·南斯拉夫·希臘·土耳其。四國、訂結東地中海公約之利益云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c36">「四底」得渡後之各業自處如何 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>去冬總結帳以後所認為最大難關之「四底」長期放欵收回問題。如今似有平穩解决之望矣。錢業公會旣於前日會議决定各錢莊在可能範圍內。對到期之放欵。予以變通。以實踐扶助工商業之本旨。而中央中交三銀行。亦擬仍照去年總結帳前辦法。拆放巨欵。救濟市面。銀行業之工商信用小借欵。更有就已籌得之二百五十萬元。無論政府之二百五十萬元籌撥與否。决於四月底以前實行出借之說。凡此皆足以安定人心。維持市面者也。</p>
<p>雖然。天下事往往以為艱難險砠者。臨時或得安然過去。為其有備也。及以為無妨矣。而或轉以一髮之牽。掀動大局。患固常生於所忽。故「四底」難關雖可過去。而來日方長。險象未去似不容不審愼淤後。茲就平易淺近者一陳之。</p>
<p>（一）此次之「四底」放欵問題。能得設法渡過。皆銀錢業羣策羣力分工合作之功。是誠絕好之現象。此後仍望秉此精神。終始不懈。大銀行之與小銀行間。錢業之與銀行間。銀錢業之與各業間。皆能出以互助。抱共存共榮之見。去其傾軋之積習。而以協和為職志。蓋市塲旣未能完全樂觀。則同為市塲之一員。無彼何有我。共處漏舟之中。斷非可以「各人自掃門前雪」。以求苟安於一時。更不可以幸災樂禍相存心。冀人敗而我能倖存。彼此皆舍通力合作外。難望「度過荒年有熟年也」。</p>
<p>（二）各業之中。經營不一。而在整個市塲之中。無形有形間。無有不相關聯之處。萬一有認為足以發生不安。貽害市塲之事故。其得警戒於事先。消弭於無形。誠為最善。或至不能彌縫。而其影響不大。僅致一身之不安者。則亦已矣。否則卽應為之設法援助。俾得度過目前。面後整飭其將來。不宜咎其已往。謂為應食之報。而坐視不救要知人心所嚮。不察深淺。浮躁之氣。一發難收。星星之火。足以燎原。不可不愼也。</p>
<p>（三）屏除自私自利之念。於打盡算盤之際。一念他人。稍顧自身之將來。彼擁有巨產者。平時旣竭盡人間之享受。及至困逆之來。不自省悟。而欲以自己之所失。轉嫁於大衆。其自為計固巧矣。獨不念今日所遭之困難。其因多造於昔日。食果已如是。而猶欲種未來之惡因。卽使醫得眼前瘡。亦恐悖入悖出。徒見其為損人不利己也。吾人希望今之救濟市面。能從多數人之利益着想。莫為少數人之私利打算。汕頭白票。足為殷鑑。</p>
<p>（四）自海外金融風潮迭起。本國市塲時亦發生無稽之謠諑。相驚伯有。談虎色變。比自孔宋二氏一再聲明。人民漸瞭然於政府政策之穩健。决不至有行險之舉。宋氏談話中。又語及宋漢章氏之出任中行總經理。謂其「前在袁世凱時代。力使中行鈔票不停兌。此次膺任總經理。深慶得人」。弦外之音。尤可想見。夫在袁世凱時代所不肯為之事。豈肯行之於今日。當局旣示人以信。人亦當以信報之。互相信賴。則人心安而市面定。積藏出而銀根裕矣。</p>

<h3 id="c111">美國繼續提高銀價　我方籌避免影響辦法　美經濟考察團到滬時將與商討　宋子文晚訪孔祥熙談商 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>新聲社云、美國提高銀價後、我國政府暨金融界各業等均甚重視、已籌劃週免影饗辦法、决俟美經濟考察團抵滬時、提出交換意見、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>我國重視美抬銀價</p>
<p>我國前受美國政府將白銀收歸國有之影響、國內白銀鉅額流出、以致籌碼發生缺乏恐慌、工商業均受極大打擊、幸經財政部嚴緝私運、設外匯平市委員會、安定市面、對銀出口、除增稅外、加征平衡稅、同時獎勵外銀進口、於是白銀流出漸絕、市面漸趨穩定、為時未久、美國突再度提高銀價、我國政府與人民均甚重視之、</p>
<p>各業籌商安定市面</p>
<p>滬金融界及各業等、鑒於我國為入超之國、去年受美國收歸白銀國有影響、工商業受創甚鉅、此次美國又提高銀價、恐不免有白銀流出、興我國關係重大、受創之工商業、尚未復元、若再遭此影響、恐益不堪、故連日金融界及各業領袖、均作非正式之會晤、除設法自行安定市面外、深望政府速籌具體辦法、以免影響我國商業、</p>
<p>政府籌劃避免辦法</p>
<p>我國政府、對於美國提高銀價、曾電駐美國公使施肇基氏、通知美國政府、提高銀價、應竭力避免影饗我國工商業、同時幷籌劃避免影饗辦法、中國銀行董事長宋子文、昨赴西愛咸斯路、謁財政部長孔祥熙、聞對於美國提高銀價案、曾談及、</p>
<p>與考察團交換意見</p>
<p>滬金融界對於美國提高銀價案、决俟美國經濟考察團抵滬時、提出互相交換意見、並盼望該團注意提高銀價後、對我國工商業影饗、因我國存銀若再鉅量流出、則工商業將不堪矣、而我國民之購買力、亦將急遽減低、今該經濟考察團已决定本月十九日、由日本來滬、</p>
<p>外匯市價一致放長</p>
<p>昨日、中央銀行公布之電匯賣價折合如不、倫敦每國幣一元為一先令七便士半、紐約每國幣一百元為三十九美元三七五、巴黎每國幣一百元為五九五法郎、柏林每國幣一百元為九七馬克二五、新聲社記者按、紐約電匯、每國幣一百元數月來均為三十四至三十五美元、前日掛牌為三十七元六二五、昨日突漲至三十九美元餘、一日間放長百分之五、足證美國提高銀價後影饗之大也、</p>
<p>平衡稅率無甚上下</p>
<p>外匯平市委員會、昨日上午十時、經委員席德懋·貝淞蓀·張佩紳·之會商决定、平衡稅率為百分之六，七五、與平時並無上下、（按晚報有載平衡稅率漲至一·一〇·七五者、查此數為英匯比價、一先令十便士又四分之三、與平衡稅無關、</p>

<p>三北復函交涉</p>
<p>三北公司聞宜昌海員分會强派工友上輪、喧賓奪主、驅逐在輪茶房理貨等人、當經總公司航函宜昌海員分會、略謂、壽昌輪內之理貨與中艙部職工、係救濟本公司德興·富華·兩輪內失業職工、而安挿至壽昌船內者、貴分會豈能擅自委派職工上船、目壽昌輪之輪機部分、尚未整理就緒、今回退滬、須將該船入塢、所有船內職工、統浪解散、請速撤回云云、</p>
<p>宜海會之力爭</p>
<p>宜昌海員分會、得三北函後、即復稱、壽昌輪之船籍港、旣注明宜昌、則船上理貨與中艙部之職工、自應由本分會派定、今照該輪應用理貨十二人、中艙職工二十四人、本分會以半數委派上船、計理貨六名、茶房十二名、已覺萬分讓步、由會派之到掄、已與該輪買辦劉鏞章言明、至稱到滬進廠、職工解散等事、則非本分會所能顧及者也云云、</p>
<p>職工薪工糾紛</p>

<h3 id="c170">足球界光榮紀念　東華共得四個錦標　昨六比一勝猶太又得甲組錦標　法商勝西捕甲組亞軍優游坐得　—今日法商棄權於東華— <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>東華足球隊雖經受罰、三球員不能出塲作戰、但威風依然不咸、昨日在逸園迎戰猶太、以六比一大勝、綜計西聯甲組聯賽、九隊參加、每隊須相遇兩次、共須十六塲比賽、東華雖尚餘三次未賽、但已得二十四分、高居首席、更以今日東華對法商之賽、法商自願棄權、於是又不勞而獲二分、共計已得二十六分、甲組錦標、已為東華所得、於是本季東華甲乙隊、先後榮歷史高塔盃丙組杯初級杯等四大錦標、開空前未有之新紀錄、面尤以華人從未染指之史高塔盃、亦由該隊奪得、實堪　幸、</p>
<p>東華大勝猶太</p>
<p>戰幕初開猶太逞勇　昨日雙方戰兄、並不緊張、良以兵力懸殊、成一面倒之勢、惟截幕初開、猶太隊初生之犢、不長猛虎、勃林蓋一聲呼嘯、率衆來犯、當時猶太五前鋒、合力攻城、東華於此頗為危急、幸賴關李兩衛、及顧尚勸等、奮勇抗拒、救出險球、陳虞添攫得一球、傳遞與李義臣、順勢一脚、球急而速、甚為淸晣、狄特律欲救無方、坐視該球入內、造成一比零之優勢、時為比賽後之二十分鐘也、又五分鐘、猶太隊非法撞人、判罰十二碼球、乃由雇尚動主踢、脚頭起處、應聲而入、以二比零佔勝、</p>
<p>上半時四比零終局　猶太隊連失兩球、亦圖雪恥、於是再度來犯、均經東董諸將擊退、嗣李義臣又得罰十二碼之機會、奮力一蹴、詎因操之過念、竟越網而過、未獲命中、李義臣殊不甘心、孤軍奮鬥造成三比一、至三時三十五分、東華李寗被敵隊所襲、竟致受傷倒地、不得已出場休急、須臾再入應戰、嗣東華諸將再接再厲、合力圍攻、猶太於此、頗有應付為雖之慨、錢佐芝於亂軍中窺得機會、上前一脚、輕輕人網、東華以四比零取勝、</p>
<p>下半時顧尙勷立功　檸檬時間之後、東華雄風依舊、李陳戴諸先鋒、大逞雄威、猶太狄特律施展身乎、撥球出外、因誤踢東華球員、至為裁判員判罰十二碼、仍由顧尚勷主踢、成五比零、</p>
<p>六比一幸免吃鴨蛋　猶太隊見國勢垂危、不甘受鴨蛋之恥、急急加鞭、前鋒五將軍、勇往直前、塔克門脚底加油、L格林勃邊疆發難、S格林勃盤球來犯、連越二道侍衛防綫、球入網底、關澢安束手無策、索性客氣、乃成六比一、免吃鴨蛋、嗣後東華錢佐芝帶球直入、情球飛太高、越網而過、而猶太雖有負隅作困襲鬥、卒無效果、最後賈幼良傳李義臣、直揭黃龍、一蹴而入、以六比一終局、東華大勝、</p>

<p>昨日另一塲甲組賽、法商對西捕、在申園交鋒、查西捕成續、僅少優游一分、是戰西捕若勝法商、則得亞軍、若負則亞軍為優游坐得、故西捕乃傾全力應付、無如法商頑强、不甘示弱、是以雙方戰來甚為激烈、結果法商以五比三勝、間接造福優游、亞軍遂為優游所得、</p>
<p>法商今日棄權</p>
<p>今日西聯甲組僅東華對法商一塲、原定在申園舉行、茲悉法商自願棄權、故今日無比賽、東華乃再加二分、錦標已得、尚餘二塲、恐將放棄不賽、因東華明日卽須起程赴高　比賽也、現甲組各隊成績如下、</p>

<p>中華足球會之中字組、共五隊參加、採燮循環制、現維華隊已六戰六勝、佔居首席、冠軍希望極厚、茲該隊尚餘對復旦及眞如兩塲、祇須再勝一塲、即得錦標、蓋復旦已負一次、和一次、而眞如則已負二次、和一次、眞如已絕對無希望、復旦尚須對眞如維華及商船各賽一次、如均能獲勝、則尚少維華一分、若眞如亦勝維華、則錦標將為復且所有、故以後之形勢、殊堪注意、更以目下維華陣容、似不如前矣、各隊形勢如下、</p>

<p>昨日維華大勝樂濟　昨日中字組祇維華對樂濟一塲、在江灣路先施球塲舉行、該塲面積狹小、崎嶇不平、更以久雨之後、兩邊低窪之處、積水如小河、雙方實行水戰、毫無藝術可言、上半時維華攻勢極盛、凈獲八球、下半時敷衍從事、樂濟全軍保守、僅負一球、結果九比零維華大勝、其陣綫如下、</p>

<p>昨為中國文化建設協會主辦之全國讀書運動大會之第六日、該會特請國立曁南大學理學院長李熙謀演講「怎樣研究自然科學」、今日（十四）下午三時一刻、該會敦請孫寒冰在中西電台播送「怎樣研究政治、茲錄李熙謀演詞全文如下、</p>
<p>自然科學定義　中國文化建設協會為指導靑年研究學術起見、特聘請學者舉行各種學術研究之演講、今天要兄弟講演「怎樣研究自然科學」、兄弟對於目然科學殊少深切研究、今日祗能把研究的方法與個人的經騐、與各位談談、我們要研究目然科學、先得明瞭什麼呌做自然科學、我們生存在宇宙中間、字宙間之形形色色、事事物物、是千變萬化倘能以合理的方法、加以整理歸類、不明白之處、或懷疑處、則用種種推騐·考查·計算·等法以證明、以解釋、必須考證到無可懷疑而後止、專門研究這自然界一切現象的學問、可謂自然科學、任鴻雋先生對於自然科學曾下一定義、謂自然科學是根據宇宙間自然現象、依論理方法的研究、彙集而成有規則有系統之知識、我覺得這個定義是相當充備而值得我們注意的、</p>
<p>研究科學動機　研究自然科學的動機、可說與人生以俱來、自有人類以來、研究自然科學的興趣與需要、可設得有一個時間曾間斷過、倘加以分拆、其原因有二、一由於好奇心、與求知慾、自然界日月星辰之運行、風雨雪冰之變動、在原始人早就感到奇異與害怕、因此在古代對於天文學已有開始研究之陳跡、天文學在自然科學中發生最早、便是人類對於自然現象發生好奇與求知慾的明證、第二原因、便是由於環境之需要、人類生活之四大需要為衣食住行、設有一種脫離自然科學、自然科學自是隨人類歷史而日益成長、與人類文化程度而日益倡明、舉一個最著明之例證、巴比倫埃及幾何學所以發明、便由於當時環境之需要所致、</p>
<p>科學與非科學　所謂科學與非科學之分別、是有一定界限的、我們不能隨便混淆、在中國歷史上、有所謂燧人氏鑽木取火、以及發　羅盤·造紙·製漆·釀酒·火藥·印刷·製造舟車、發明瓷器等、一般人以為中國古代的自然科學是很倡明的了、其實這不過是片斷的科學技術、與科學知識而已、决不是現在所謂眞正科學、眞正的科學、必須有系統之解釋、有合理的分析、例如鑽木取火、何以鑽木而能取火呢、這由檯物體之增加磨擦、由磨擦而生熱、由生熱而燃燒、由燃燒而發生火的功能與作用、這樣系統的解釋、得到的結論、才是科學的、所以所謂科學、非科學之別、即科學的乃追求其發生原因、過程中的現象、而求得其結論、他若片段的科學技能與科學知識、我人决不能謂為科學、</p>
<p>條件以及精神　研究自然科學的方法、英國學者羅素曾說、科學方法有一項必要的條件、一是觀察、二是推斷、所謂觀察就是放在實騐室裏去實騐、所謂推斷就是拿我們的理智去推論、唯實騐才能觀察正確、唯其推論、論斷才能準確、我個人覺得羅素這二句話確是至理名言致於研究自然科的精神、一是崇實、二是貴確、一一是察徵、四是　斷、五是存疑疑</p>
<p>科學基礎智識　研究自然科學正和研究其他學問一樣、如要研究中國古代社會、對於骨甲文字古代地理、古代歷史等必須有很深厚的基礎、研究自然科學的基礎學問、便是數學與力學、假定對於數學與力學沒有堅固礎、深切研究、想稍涉自然科學之藩籬、是萬萬辦不到、自然科學的智識在中國知識羣中如是淺薄、如是狹隘、而中國靑年學生對於數學與力學之興趣、？如是低淺而缺乏興趣、我們緬懷自然科學在現代國家强弱關係之密切、眞令人不勝感慨系之、</p>
<p>研究科學方法　最後我想給大家一個嚴重的注意、我們不談救國則已、要談救國、便非研究自然科學不可、否則空談救國、直如南宋未年、空談科學、無異遜淸維新、全國靑年學子、能懍於民族之杌揑、國家之危殆、疆土之日蹙、欲奮發救國救民、决非血氣之勇、匹夫之力所克挽回、必須脚蹈實地、深人科學之園地、研究自然科學便須具備下列四個基本方法、第一個是思想的訓練、要使自己的認識淸楚、思慮周密、便非研究哲學論理學、心理學不可、研究自然科學者、經過哲理論理學心理學之訓練後、始能深入堂粵、而得深造、第二個方法、便是苦志力學、中國讀書人以一目十行不求甚解為聰明是害盡了中國數千年來的學子、假定要研究一種高深的學問不孜孜兀兀、日以繼夜、反覆研討、所得幾何、第二方法必須專心、一暴十寒、無補於事、必須竭畢生心力、始有一得、第四方法便要實騐、自然科學固然需要苦思力索、尤須重視實的觀察、我國各大中學、實騐室之設備、或因陋就簡、有者甚且試騐器具都付缺如、值茲生</p>
<p>產教育已定為國家的教育政策時、深盼全國各教　育行政機關　學校當局有以深切注意之、完了、</p>

<p>— 碧梧</p>
<p>許多不願或不敢正視當前的事態的人們，儘管跑回去摟住陳年的屍骨，而將「母敎」「母愛」「等名辭，吹得天花亂墜；然而事實吿訴我們，女人確在求失掉她們的生殖官能而不可得。有的為避免墮入「母」字的天牢，寗願犧牲不嫁或絕對禁慾：有的戰戰兢兢胃些險濤，終於惹下大禍，而用墮胎的辦法，與未成形的兒女拚命。所謂「母親」，竟是殘酷甚於豺狼獅虎或敵人。</p>
<p>護道的先生，也許將這些事實看成是維新的，解放的婦女所作，而加以詆罵：其實是他的老眼昏花。眞正維新的，解放的婦女，為了生活和工作，確也有墮胎的人物：但大批摩登的姑娘，她們的墮胎，却幷不是為求光明的解放。除了這兩種墮胎的婦女以外，更有第三種實行這事的女人，然而她們早已被護道的先生所忽略。因為她們原是野草似的自生自滅，一生行事，萬難掛上人們的口齒。可是實際，從這種野草似的女人腹中絞殺或毀滅的小生命，正不知有前兩種女人的多少倍：不過因為她們是不聲不響的黑屋角中的動作，便無從統計罷了。</p>
<p>報載鎭江少婦沈陳氏，因家貧來滬為傭，但身已懷孕，深恐日久工作不便，故私用蘿蔔乾一條，謀使胎兒落下。不料功效未見，而該婦已痛苦萬分；後經醫生為之取下，得慶更生。然因墮胎觸犯刑法，由法院判處兩年徒刑。</p>
<p>這事之幸而得以見於報端，一則因其發生於文明的上海，有消息靈通的巡捕房和報館採訪員：二則因其所用非藥，胎雖動而不下，故至於揭穿。若沒有這兩種條件，早已無事的無事了。不見因墮胎而身死的鄉間貧苦婦女，百中尚難得一二被人傳道嗎？</p>
<p>「墮胎一，誰都知道牠的損害健康甚至喪失生命，而且又有刑罰的恐怖：然而婦女仍舊胃險而行，是甚麼東西鼓足她的勇氣？無非是為得「生存」。生存的慾望比什麼都强，為了生存，他可以建設或毀棄一切可敬可愛可懼可怖的人類萬事。年來大多數的婦女，都走上了絕路，她已自顧不暇，怎能希望她接受為國育才的大義？時至今日，就眼看種族一天一天在那兒絕滅，也是自然的。</p>
<p>或許有人咒駡婦女為甚麼這樣自私自利，死要自己生存，而不肯生育。然而，好罷！婦女倘然連「生存的慾望都打消了時，還成了甚麼呢？還能做甚麼呢？</p>
<p>社會旣漠視女人的生存，不給她以生路，她不給社會生育，總是無可奈何。縱令法令如何嚴密，她的比墮胎更消極的避孕，便任何人也不能阻撓。如是而不久之後，這地面便可僅留靑草，供他方人牧畜。</p>
<p>我們一口氣沒有全然斷絕，當然總是想我們的民族萬年。對於耳聞目見的許多婦女不肯生育的事實，眞要望社會的為婦女解放，好為社會本身謀解放，開闢一條民族生存之路。</p>

<h3 id="c189">第二節　奴隸化了的婦女生活 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>古代希臘及羅馬的婦女，隨着財產私有制的發達和奴隸制勞動的强化，早已被男子奪去了社會的生產努動的權利，她們已經不是國民經濟上主要財富的生產者了！她們從廣大的社會的生產領域被驅入於家庭，由社會人變為家庭奴隸了！</p>
<p>什麼是家庭奴隸呢？她的存在意義，第一要去滿足丈夫卽家主的性慾，第二要去生育丈夫的後嗣者，第三為着保證丈夫的正出子女的準確性，不和其他男人交際，第四幽禁在寢室和廚房間，祇要溫順服從，不得反抗！</p>
<p>男權中心的希臘雅典其和國是最初設定種種道德律及法律，剝奪婦女的自由，膺懲婦女的反抗。所謂索龍（Solon）的共和國新法是規定犯了姦淫的婦女處以死刑，或由其丈夫把她當作奴隸而出賣，但對於男子則任其自由。這是典型的男權國家的法律！</p>
<p>希臘及羅馬的自由市民的妻女，在物質生活上自然比女奴隸優越得多，但她們也是同樣的無權利和不自由。旣婚婦女是完全隸屬於丈夫，在牢籠一般的家庭裏做長期的「賣淫」奴隸的生活，未婚的女子是隸屬於父母，沒有自行擇夫之權，深囚在閨房裏等待着父母的出賣，她們的貴重的生命在不見天日的寢室裏和廚房間消麼到死的那天！</p>
<p>關於當時希臘婦女的生活，一位喜劇作家是如下的描寫出來！</p>
<p>「一切有精神和肉體的之內，</p>
<p>啊！最明哀的存在，實在是我們女子！</p>
<p>我們非帶了嫁妝賣給丈夫不可，——最壞的是我們的身體也歸他了。</p>
<p>不論他是怎樣的人，善人或者惡人，</p>
<p>這種危險最足驚人——因為離婚是女人的侮辱，一而且女人是不計拒絕丈夫的。</p>
<p>……中略……</p>
<p>男人可以避去家裏的煩惱，在外面可以尋找能够安慰他的，</p>
<p>在朋友之傍，在同輩之列——而我們則非孤寂地守在家裏不可！</p>
<p>他們常說，女人毫無危險地，</p>
<p>住在家裏，當他們戰爭的時期。</p>
<p>好愚的謬見！我情願上三次戰塲，不願經一次產褥！」（參照「婦人與社會」）</p>
<p>但是，另一方面男子對於自己的妻女嚴禁其他男人來侵犯，而他自身却不斷的追求他人的妻女。於是為着緩和這個矛盾，發生了希臘有名的娼婦制度！起草雅典新法律的索龍，居然設置國營娼寮，公然實行變態的多妻制度了。一位無恥的雅典男人竟公然說道：</p>
<p>「我們和一個女子結婚是因要正出的子女和家庭間忠實的主婦，我們用侍女，為的是身邊的照應和日常的侍奉，我們嫖妓女為的是愛的亨樂。」（同上）</p>
<p>可是，當時的娼婦並不是誰都可以買來賣去的女奴隸，而是超脫一切束縛婦女的道德律而勇敢的做自由生活的女市民！她們有高尚的敎養，學問上也有相當的造詣，又勇敢的參加政治活動。例如愛施帕西（Aspasin），拉伊斯（Lais），菲利那（Phryne），列奧那（Leona），亞耳海那薩（Archeanassa）等都是歷史上有名的娼婦。亞耳海那薩是大哲學家柏拉圖（Plato）的愛人，愛施帕西是大哲人蘇格拉底（Sccrates）的好友，非利那也是希臘貴族界的交際花！　紀元前五百年頃的娼婦列奧那是參加於當時反對纂奪共和國權力的僭王之政治陰謀，遂和共他同志們一起被捕，在殘酷的拷刑之下遝不肯吿白實情，竟咬斷自己的舌頭，吐到裁判官的臉上去！</p>
<p>這樣，當時的娼婦是有高尚的知識和品格，而且很自由的和上流人交際，這可以說是母權制崩壞後婦女們反抗男權束縛的另一種表現！</p>
<p>此外在希臘還有傑出的女學者們，他們在文化上的貢獻極多，在她們的弟子們中也有許多思想家。例如阿斯福是有名的女詩人，阿格諾支加是穿着男服學醫而從事醫術的最初的女醫生，亞歷由得里阿的美麗的女敎授伊巴支阿是大哲學者，世界各處的學者們為她的講義，不遠千里而來！</p>
<p>這個樣子，當時的婦女們雖則在一方面受男權的絕對壓迫，但另一方面充分的表現奮鬭反抗的精神！我們再拿希臘有名的喜劇『婦女國民會議』來看吧！這裏的女主人公普洛克蘇哥拉竟提出財產共有制的議案，這是值得注目的。她提議說：</p>
<p>我是要求，一切的東西都要共有，一切都應屬於大家，從此要消滅富者和貧者，應當要消滅某種人是連葬身之土地都沒有而另一種人是領有廣大的士地的事情。婦女也應當成為共有物。應當要使她們和自己所喜歡的男人生孩子。』（參照「勞動婦女革命」）</p>
<p>很顯然地，這是希臘婦女對於財產私有制，强制結婚及婦女的奴隸地位提出反抗的議案。這是紀元前四百年卽距今二千五百年頃婦女所提出的抗議，可是直到今日還沒有被實現！不！果然在世界的某一一部分，正在更好的實現起來了！</p>
<h3 id="c190">希特勒治下的德國婦女（續） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 烏倫夫人講詞順譯</p>
<p>從公生活驅逐出來</p>
<p>希特勒掌握政權以後所最能實現的，就是在公生活中及在產業界的全面把女性驅逐這一件事！一九一九年到一九三二年，德國國會上，除了國社黨，其他一切政黨的女議員都可以參加，而且他們都很好的完成使命，就中如人口問題，食料問題，生產勞動婦女的保護等，在關係婦女的某議會委員會，其功績是最顯著的。</p>
<p>然而，一九三三年總選舉以來，一僩女議員都沒有，政府各部要職，絕無婦女參與，女學校經營者，旣婚的女敎師等地位，均由男子取而代之。而最堪注目的第三帝國的干涉，竟及於公務人員。一九一九年的憲法，是「撤廢對女公務人員的一切差別待遇。」結果，從來被禁閉的婦女踴躍的參加於種種職業，然而，照最近法令的規定，則婦女有三十五年勞續者始得常任職員的地位。尤其，無視愛瑪憲法，同稱勞動，女子的賃銀却比男子低，這是對婦女非常不利的。</p>
<p>陷於危機的家庭生活</p>
<p>婦女退出產業界的事實，根據數字便可以具體的看到其變遷。國社黨最新把握政權時，婦女的僱傭勞動者為一千百五十萬。即佔使用者的三成六分。而僅有六百萬的婦女從業者，到一九三四年五月更急激的低下為三百萬。</p>
<p>德國為着復興家庭生活而驅逐生產勞動婦女的政策，實際上是破壞家庭的。一九三四年五月十三日，內務大臣蒲列克博士這樣說道：「不管誰，能够眞正的履行生物學的義務的，應給以特種的權利。所以，兒女多的母親要到職塲工作，是不可能而且不正當的。一方面負着生活的重担，一方面又因好幾次的姙娠和生產而减弱健康的母親，固不必從事於工塲勞動，而年靑强健的女性也應當留在家裏。」</p>
<p>雖然一切的言論自由全被剝奪，但反對婦女僱傭廢止的呼聲，却由婦女自身發出，這是值得注目的。幾週間來，在柏林各地的揭示板上貼出關於柏林市會發行的僱傭規定的綱領。</p>
<p>國社黨婦女部的機關誌，一九三四年七月號，關於此問題如下的記載着：</p>
<p>「這次的綱領，對於超年齡的高級職業婦女乃至　員等，當然給以異常的衝擊和危懼。尤其如下的諸項目，對於一切的智識婦女是十分憎惡的。即</p>
<p>「（三）德國年靑女子——緊執着鍋和器皿，掃帝等，這樣，你可以得到你的如意郎君。認識你的天職呀——跟着你的天職行動呀！不要以為商店及事務室的安易　　　　你將來作主婦的職務史有價值。家　　是使你更健康，更活潑，更富魄力的。」</p>
<p>（四）勞動婦女—與其從事事務，母寗學習為妻，不要把男子留在家裏，你自己回家，你的職業讓給男子。不然，他們祇靠你一點點的小工作間接被養活外，沒有其他出息的。財實，養老保險都是無益的，使你的生活有正當的意義罷！否則，你的精神身體也除了破滅外沒得什麼？」</p>
<p>「（七）我們的主婦——不要奪了你丈夫和兒子的工作。家裏的使用人是因為你不作才需要的。」</p>
<p>第七項是剝奪了中產階級的婦女的有報酬的勞動的權利的，她們不得已的解僱使用人，自已操持一切家事。</p>
<p>國社黨是禁止婦女從事於有報酬的勞動的，婦女們是處於無報酬勞動的半奴隸的狀態。在勞動大臣的公報上面，如下的記載着。</p>
<p>「一九三四年春，卒業於初等敎育的女學生六萬人，其大部分是不能就職的。然而，坐食也不是她們的願望。於是不能不使她們從事於「家事實習」，儘可能使德國人的家庭為這目的而開放。」</p>
<p>這樣，所有階級的主婦便解僱了從來的使用人，而無條件的使用這些少女為無報酬的半奴隸。因為家事實習的少女們，在鄉村是被送往地主家從事農作的。據勞動交換局本部的報吿是「婦女失業者已經沒有了。一九三四年三月三十一日還有五七五，〇七四名的失業婦女。但財政部却要在一九三四年中完全消滅失業婦女。剩下來的則非在結婚，實習家事，農作等當中選擇一者不可。無論如何，都市的所有者們是不許僱用女人以侵占男子的位置的。」</p>
<p>婦女們最怕的就是從事農作，故常常失業也不登記，但這樣的事情，給官廳方面曉得的時候是要受罰的。</p>
<p>這樣，在德國現狀下的婦女，便完全被消減了數十年來艱難苦　得來的若干成果，而送轉於中世紀的狀態。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c191">停留在生活綫上的人們 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 織雲</p>
<p>兩個秋我躺在自己的床上過了去，一個春我就是什在那些痛苦的人羣中過着的。當我感受到某一種健康上的壓拍時，我就會憶起那病院來，憶起那病院中的一羣來。什麼壓迫都有反抗的可能，祇有受了健康上的壓迫時是最反抗不了的。</p>
<p>一個沒住過病院的人是不會對病院發生恐怖的。</p>
<p>愛生的人被招到這里來求生，愛死的人也被抬到這里來强迫他生；但愛生的人常常會生不了，而愛死的人却很多活着出去的。許多孩子從產婦間里抱向嬰兒間里去，許多人們却從病房里抬到太平間去。病院就是這樣，個水遠演着這種可怕的戲的東西。</p>
<p>自殺的人差不多兩三天就有一個抬進來，他們要死的原因常常是很複雜的。人的心理眞不懂得是怎樣的，一個願意死而已死得差不多了的人，總是用手術把他弄活來；但等到他已能感覺到是在生和死的邊緣上而掙扎着的時候，他們就把他丟在那里而不理睬了，就像已完了事似的。這些被救活了的人們到了可以走走時，常帶着那軟弱的身子出現在病房外的走廊上，他們是眞的被救了嗎？我不能知道。</p>
<p>人總是愛生的多，祗要能再給他一個可以活的機會時，他總是想活下去的。有那麼多的人整年整月的在病床上忍受那許多的磨折，都是為了要生。他們不知道在什麼時候高熱或疼痛會來襲擊他們，夢囈和呻吟不斷的充滿了空間；有時他們一身朦了一大塊白布被抬下去，到受了一陣宰割後抬上來還沒睜開眼睛。田漢說得好，人是一架　械，壞了，得抬上這　來修理，可是醫生並不是萬能的機械匠呵！當他們問着醫生：「我幾時會好呢一？聲生指着天說：「問他」。他們看着外而籬笆那邊的大樹，由枯枝到嫩葉，由嫩葉到蓋滿了綠色，一切生物都向着上面爬，而他們呢？他們沒有春，他們是停留在生活綫上的人們，他們要活，但他們沒能力使自己好好的活下去。於是他們就想到了死：一讓我死了吧，這罪！」他們哭了起來。可是只要他們想着自己還沒有走到生的極端時，他們又忍受着挨下去了。</p>
<p>這是一個痛苦的大冶爐。不幸的人們除了目身的病痛外，物質的待遇不等不去管它（當然不是每一個人都是有產者呵！）就是精神上也不能得到安慰的；他們最能安靜的時候就是親友們從外置　着什麼消息來時。我想沒一個病院是會合理的！在我　離院的幾個星期中，我常去看她們，我雖是去看我熟識的幾個，可是我　記　着他們中間的許多事。當她們嘆着說。「我好不了了」，我嘴里總是安慰着她們，可是我確實曉得有兩個已了兩年以上的是永不會健康的。每去一次，有兩三天我會不安定；以後也就不大去了，我對這病院是那麼的害怕起來。去秋又病時，醫生要我住院，我對他搖頭，他說：「你靴道不要命嗎」？我想只要還有半個我沒死去時，我是不會再住進去的。再以後我就一直沒去過，但我知道我所熟職的幾個是不會都能脫出這痛苦的鎖鏈的。</p>
<p>春又來了，我又記起了那些沒有春的人們，那些停留在生活綫上的人們啊！</p>
<h3 id="c192">女子勞工夜校偶訪記 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>天上淋淋瀝瀝下着不大不小的雨風是愈刮愈大，光着頭皮跑了幾條長街的我一跳上電車，車廂里的那種溫暖而舒服的雰圍氣，令我覺得我是立刻由地獄升到了天堂。在吐出暖氣的人羣中，剛佔好一個位置，突然對面傳來了一聲陌生而又熟悉得有些渺茫的聲音：</p>
<p>「啊，你是……！</p>
<p>我抬起頭望着一個扁長臉的小學敎員模樣的女人，也不覺同樣喊出了：</p>
<p>「啊，你是……！」</p>
<p>就這應着，我在這偶然的機綠中，碰着了我八年前的一位要好的同學；張玉英女士。她被壓在家庭的重擔之下，白日做過牛馬似的小學敎員，晚上七時到九時還要在一個靑年會辦的女子勞工夜校敎書。我為舊日的友情所吸引，一直把她送到學校，順便參觀了她的工作。</p>
<p>這夜校本身沒有校舍，它是借一白日上課的小學樓上的三間敎室為敎室。全體學生共有一百多人，共分三級：初級，高級，特級。修業期，各定半年為畢業。課程有尺牘，國語讀本，算學，地理等。初級學生最多，約有六七十，高級四五十，特級十多人。據說女士們很少能讀到特級，因為她們都是慢慢嫁的嫁，走的走，有些則因環境改變不能繼續讀下去了。</p>
<p>這晚的雨雖是逐漸下大，但三間大房望着望着人都坐滿了。她們走進敎室，一坐上書桌，不是動手抄寫，便是看書，敎員隊里雖多了我這個陌生人，她們好像沒看見似的。她們那種求知的熱切與眞誠的熊度，恐怕那些高貴的女中和女大生中，百人里也難尋出一兩個是這樣的罷。</p>
<p>不久，一個特級生打開保管箱，拿出一張她們自己辦的壁報貼在牆上。壁報內容包含圖盡與文章兩項。圖畫盡是由申報圖盡特刋選剪下來的，每幅盡下，都有她們自己的按語。如一幅蘇俄食糧販賣處的畫，上面有兩三個穿白制服賣麵包的女子，她們便在下面寫道：「蘇俄女工的生活是這樣寫意，我們的生活怎樣？」文章有論「阮玲玉的死」，「我們的出路」，「我們的敵人」等。她們知道阮玲玉的自殺，是社會殺了她的。</p>
<p>一百多人在服裝和打扮上，也有顯然的差別，初級的人，許多年齡比較的穿着都不大好，特級的馬馬虎虎，但却已帶學生模樣，高級的學生都是十八歲左右的姑娘，穿着和打扮十分之八都最漂亮了。你要是在街上看見她們，决認不出她們是女工，尤其是那溜光的黑髮，白嫩的皮膚，嬌弱織巧的身段和姿態，簡直像是老派點的富家小姐和少奶奶。我想這與她們的工作也有關係，因為她們是幹的輕巧工作——香烟廠的女工。據我朋友說，她們大都是家庭負擔很輕，或完全沒有家庭負擔的；不然，他們夜間還要幹旁的工作，那有工夫來讀書呢。我頓時明白過來了，這些大槪是所謂「小家璧玉」吧。她們的工資，據說每月能掙得數元到十數元不等，工作時間，據璧報上講的，每日是十二小時之久，</p>
<p>女工們進這勞工夜校讀書雖然五角錢的報名費外，僅只自己買書就夠了，但限於自身的生活環境而不能入學的不知有多少人，而為入學手續所限的，人歡也不少。據說這種夜校收學生頗為嚴格，沒有人介紹，沒有人祖保保——卽須担保是一個好工人——的，休想進來。所以靑年會辦的這一項慈善事業的範團，也並不怎麼普及。不過，無論如何，這總比他們聖誕節辦的苦兒同樂　要有意義百倍了，如果當事人眞是為女工而幹，並非為上帝而幹的話。</p>
<h3 id="c193">姨太太日記（續） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 關露</p>
<p>四月二十八日</p>
<p>今天上午搬進醫院來了，陪我來的是陳媽。平常在家裏陳媽不敢吿訴我的話，到醫院裏來她統統都吿訴我了。今天從進院起直到現在，她幾乎和我談了一天。有些問題我覺得太簡單的，她却流着淚，替我歎息。有時候我覺得是一使人太難堪的事體，她却覺得平凡。</p>
<p>她吿訴我，她初到許多有錢的太太們那裏去做工，時常看見那些太太們哭哭啼啼的，她總覺得越是有錢的太太，越是「人心不足」，有那麼多的錢花還覺着苦，還要和老爺鬧氣。假如使這些太太們都變成她們娘姨一樣，嫁了一個窮丈夫自己出來當奴才找飯吃，那不都上吊了嗎？當太太的是太强覇了。後來看久了，才慢慢地知道一些太太們的苦了。太太們比娘姨好的地方就是錢用得多一些，受氣和碰釘子還是一樣的。</p>
<p>她說着這件事的時候自己又哭起來了。她說起她從前怎麼樣當童養媳，怎麼樣被人駡是男人的娼婦。在家裏耕田的時候為了生產又受了些什麼苦。現在丈夫有了姘頭，不要她了。她說着順便就示意我：這次×長送我進醫院來，往後大槪是不會再接我回大公館去了；說是在我產後替我在外面租房子住。</p>
<p>這話在最初聽見的時候似乎有一點覺着不自然，但是頭腦冷靜了一點以後也沒有什麼。這不是我一個人的下塲呀，是女人們的下塲。</p>
<p>五月廿九日</p>
<p>一個多月沒有寫日記了。醫生說我現在已經是很利害的「歇斯脫里一，呌我在生產前後要特別的修養。這一月來他們什麼事都不讓我幹，信也不讓我寫，連筆和墨水都拿走了。昨天我說要給父親寫信，才騙了一枝鉛筆來。但是陳媽整天總監視着我，其實這種監視對我有什麼益處呢？就是一年不寫日記也不會醫好我的任何病。</p>
<p>搬進醫院裏來，今天是最淸靜的一夜，也是最寂寞的一夜。王太太不來看我，連小姐也不來，連陳媽也被老太太呌了回去，直到這時候還不來。</p>
<p>紗窗裏印進來的梧桐樹影子，像是在吿訴人：夜深了，告訴人：世界是寂靜的，吿訴人：生活走到了盡頭；同時又吿訴人：雖然是深夜，是漆黑的深夜，但是，在梧桐樹的影子裏，還映着明月，在仰望着那明月的當中，還有着淸酸的而且在掙扎着的人！</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>兒童生活，我覺得是挺夠味不過的。我現在雖然已不是兒童了，但是我現在還是覺得兒童生活，是值得回味的。</p>
<p>兒童，沒有性的煩惱，沒有經濟的苦悶，沒有困難的問題，需求解决。每天在母親的懷抱裏醒過來，跳跳躍躍的上學校去，受着謀生的基本敎育。課餘呢，和小朋友玩玩，吃着糖果。晚上呢，哈着呵欠，再安眠在母親的催眠曲裏。</p>
<p>這種生活，現在想來，眞像登仙的一般了。</p>
<p>現在的兒童們呢，一天幸運似一天了。兒童們非但可以沐着母親的愛，在母愛中滋長着，同時，還有循循善誘的師長們，敎導他們怎麼鍜練身體，怎麼注意健康，怎麼練習禮貌，怎麼樣度着合羣的生活，儘不會再嘗到戒尺的滋味了。</p>
<p>此外，瞧哪，現代的兒童們，還有那麼多的課外讀物可讀。此外，瞧哪，現代的兒童們，還有一個歡欣熱烈的兒童節。此外，瞧哪，誰都覺得兒童是中國的最有希望的，誰都覺得這麼的一顆幼小的種子，將來不難成為大材，可製大器的</p>
<p>但是，我覺得，現在的兒童們，是挺夠掮起復興我們這個國家和民族的大任的。……我在這裏，用一百二十分的誠意，給活潑而可愛的兒童們祝福。</p>
<h3 id="c212">康德的話 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>

<p>康德，是德國的哲學家，各種學問都很能精通，他對於光陰，非常愛惜；所以他常吿訴人說：「一個人生在世上，至多不過百歲；在這百年中，過了一秒鐘，便少了一秒鐘，所以我們應該要愛惜光陰」，他不但是一個愛惜光陰的人，而且對於工作，讀書，休息，也都有一定的時間。人們問他為什麼要這樣？他說：「一個人的生活，有了規定的時間，才可按步就班的做去。不但學問可以進步，事業可以成功，並且身體也可鍜鍊，精神也可愉快。」</p>
<p>小朋友，康德這樣的愛惜光陰和有規律的生活，眞是值得我們的效法啊！</p>
<h3 id="c213">燃燒 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>在星期日的那天，芬兒和芳兒坐在家裏，彼此在問着學校裏一星期的工作。</p>
<p>芬兒先說：「妹妹！我對於算術，是很怕的，怕雖怕，但我仍很注意，决不疏忽的。妹妹，你怕什麼功課？」</p>
<p>芳兒想了一想說：「我怕的是科學，因為這一門功課，要明白裏面的原理，並且又要牢記，多麼難！我最喜歡的功課却是算術。你最喜歡那一門？』</p>
<p>芳兒說：『我却喜歡科學，因為它很有趣味，為什麼氧和氫化合便成水，這是不是很奇怪的嗎？並且對於我們將來是有密切的關係。倘不注意科學，恐怕我們不能立足於社會了。妹妹！你必須用功才好！』</p>
<p>芬兒聽了伊姊姊的話，細細的一想，是很確實的。</p>
<p>『芬兒！芬兒！替我拿一匣火柴來！』芬兒的母親在廚房裏喊着。</p>
<p>芬兒便很快的去給伊的媽媽了。</p>
<p>芬兒回來時，便問伊的妹妹：『妹妹，我要問你，稻草燒了後的重量重呢？還是沒有燒過的重？」</p>
<p>芳兒便笑了笑說：「姊姊，你傻了嗎。稻草燒過了便成灰了，那裏會比先前重呢？」</p>
<p>芬兒說：『呸！你弄錯了。燃燒後的重量，一定重！』</p>
<p>芳兒說：『我說一定輕！』伊們倆竟你一句我一句的爭論了。</p>
<p>伊們的父親從外面進來，聽得伊們在爭論，便說：「你們不用爭吵。凡是事的是非，必須要有相當的證明。』</p>
<p>伊們的父親先去找了一隻磁碗，裏面放了一些鐵粉，然後放在天平上一秤，知道了它的重量。再放在三角鐵架上，下面用火燃燒，大約燒過了四五分鐘，把火移開，等到那隻碗冷了。再放在天平秤上，便見重量重了一些，並且碗裏的鐵粉，已經變成一種紅色的東西，和鐵銹一般。</p>
<p>伊們的父親說：「你們瞧！碗裏的鐵粉，在燃燒時，吸收了氧，所以知道和鐵粉起變化一定是氧。燃燒後便增加重量，一定就是氧的重量。總而言之，凡東西燃燒後，重量一定增加，因為它是增加一部分氣體之故。』</p>

<p>— 以德</p>
<p>哥哥起身下床，拖了鞋，就忙着去大便。弟弟笑着道：「哥哥！你再遲一會兒，怕要撒在被窩裏吧？」</p>
<p>哥哥一邊大便，一邊也笑着回答道：「弟弟！這是你平常不注意我的原故，我並不是今天這樣，我是天天這樣的。我每天早上，下床之後的第一件重要工作，就是大便。大便的時間問題，實在是一個重要問題。你想：假如在吃飯的時候，忽而要大便，討厭不討厭？假如在上課的時候，忽而要大便，討厭不討厭？假如在競賽的時候，忽而要大便，討厭不討厭？……」</p>
<p>弟弟忙着道：「對的，對的！假如在那個時候大便起來，確實很討厭的。」</p>
<p>哥哥道：「所以我們每天的大便時間，應該規定；但是規定在早上起床之後，最為適當。因為在早上大便之後，今天一天中，不論在吃飯，在上課……都不必担心了。而且對於出門旅行，更有方便。假如當出門旅行的時候，中途忽而要大便，一時又找不到厕所，不是很受苦的一件事嗎？」</p>
<p>哥哥大便完了，弟弟也就去大便了。弟弟用力漲紅了臉，大聲問道：「哥哥！我一點也撒不出，這是什麼道理呢？」</p>
<p>哥哥：「這是你平常不在這個時候大便的原故。現在你不要性急，多坐一會兒，多少可以撒出一點的。以後你只要天天在這個時候大便，習慣就成自然了。」</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>王兒，是一個窮苦的父親的兒子。他的父親，是在仁德小學門口，擺設着一個食物攤兒的。貧苦人家的兒童，雖然是在學齡裏，是儘也沒有受敎育的權利的。沒有受敎育的權利且不說，同時，還有帮着父親生產的義務。王兒的父親，是十分貧苦的，自然也不能例外，所以他也每天在胸前絡着一個盤，盤上糊着一張紙，紙下面，藏着些廉價食物，跟着父親，在仁德小學附近，誘着小學生，玩「一個銅板打頭彩」的把戲。</p>
<p>那一天恰巧是四月四日，一淸早，他照倒跟着父親上仁德小學門首去。但這一天，他見到仁德小學裏的情形，有些兒特別。人是那麼的忙忙碌碌的在仁德小學裏出入着，那些小學生，也都是特別的高興，但是到他面前來打頭彩的，却特別的少。他覺得詫異，於是拉着一個熟識的小學生，問他今天學校裏，在幹甚麼事。小孩子說了兒童節三字，便又一跳一蹤的到校裏去了。接着，校裏便發出美妙的琴聲，抑揚的歌聲，拍掌聲，譁笑聲。</p>
<p>這麼的挨過了半天，父子二人是沒做滿三百個大錢。下午，學校裏是領着整校的學生，到郊外去玩去了。顯然的，下午也休想再有生意了。但是肚子裏的餓火，燒得王兒的父親眼前發黑，於是毫無理由的邏怒到了王兒身上，把王兒打得臉上靑了一大塊。王兒一壁哭着，一壁在肚子裏想道：「兒童節？怎地呌做兒童節？兒童節是該我挨揍的日子麼？」—他不知兒童節究竟是甚麼意義，但却沒命的咒詛着兒童節。</p>

<p>（二）我是小孫文，我有革命精神。我要打倒帝國主義，像個球兒打滾。</p>
<p>（三）我是小牛頓，讓人說我笨。我要用我的頭腦，向大自然追問。</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>我們一說起「錢」，便想到上面朋孫中山像的銀元，又着國旗的銅板，和花花綠綠的鈔票。其實世界上「錢」的種類多得很呢。我們看了這一幅圖，便會明白世界上有多少種奇奇怪怪的錢啊。</p>
<p>在極古的時代，是沒有現在這種銅元或鈔票的。你要說這份人家富，就道：「他家有多少家畜，多少奴隸。」這樣，家畜和奴隸就是那時候的「錢」。後來，人和人交換物品（例如拿米換布）一天比一天繁忙起來，就必須定出一種東西來做彼此交換物品時的標準，因此，皮，貝壳，鐵條，象牙，茶塊，監塊，就充作這種用塲了。</p>
<p>一直到了現代，在幾個文明國度裏，有時也用某種東西來當做「錢」用。例如加拿大用海狸皮，紐芬蘭用魚乾，德國用羹塊，佛及尼亞用烟草。又如一九一四年，美國的哈利遜地方，有一次曾用過蛋，人們到影戲院裏買票，必須捧了蛋交到買票櫃上呢。</p>

<p>— 子明</p>
<p>三月十二日，星期二。</p>
<p>這幾天校裏到的小朋友很多，連課桌都缺乏了。據說，這是校中實行强迫敎育的結果。凡是六歲到十三歲的小朋友，一定要受義務敎育。就是在初級小學四年級畢了業，才算完畢受敎育的義務。如果在學齡期的兒童不進校讀書，學校就請警察機關强迫執行</p>
<p>各國都是這樣：不過義務敎育的年限各有不同吧了。英國九年，法國七年，德國八年，比國八年，意國九年，瑞士九年，瑞典七年，美國九年，日本六年：他們辦理得很有成績，所以民智都是很高的。中國雖然定出義務敎育為四年，却沒有普遍實行。我們的校長是位很熱心的敎育家，特地訂定强迫敎育實施辦法，得縣政府的允許，吿示羣衆；如有子弟不讀書，就要受處罰的。所以，我們校裏這幾天到的小朋友多極了。</p>
<p>上午九時舉行總理逝世十周紀念，校中國旗，只叉到半旗杆高。想起來，一位救中國救世界的偉人，竟死去了十年：時間是這樣快，痛苦只有加重！有許多人常常以「繼承遺志」為口頭話：現在表現的事實是什麼呢？—國將亡了—</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>我　力的快跑，脚不停步的直到晚上，才坐下來休息一會，吃了些隨身帶着的食料，於是重又出發。到得我的食料都完了，我便吃椰子，因為這椰子可作肉食也可作飲料的　　　　　　　　　　　　　，但是到了第八天就看見海了。我見好多人，像我一樣是　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，因為有一種濃烈的香料，是在海濱近邊產生的。</p>
<p>這些人旣看見了我，便離開了他們的工作走上來和我說話。我樂於聽他們用着我故鄉的方言，這便給我知道自己是同朋友們在一起了。</p>
<p>我將破船的事和在黑人那裏的生活吿知了他們，他們見了我都滿心歡喜。他們以為我能脫身於那些黑人之手，眞是我絕大的好運。</p>
<p>末後我們都上了一艘船，載着大批香料開駛，準時便到了我這班新朋友所先前出發的地方。他們帶着我主　見他們的王，我就把種種冒險的故事說與他聽。當下他喚朝臣看顧着我，給與我一切需要的東西。</p>
<p>我在這地方過着很快樂的時光。不久就在王朝中居了一僩很高的職位。總之，沒有一人更比我幸運的，所有朝中和鎭中的人都請求着做我的朋友。</p>
<p>不上幾時，大家都不當我是從異地來的人，而當我是他們一鄉的人了。</p>
<p>有一件事使我很覺得詫異的，便是一個人騎了馬出去時，我瞧他裸着馬背，也沒有韁和踏脚蹬。我去找王間他為甚麼如此。</p>
<p>我吿知他我們在巴克達所用的東西。他並不知道我是甚麼意思，因為我所說的這些東西，他不曾聽得過。</p>
<p>於是我得了一人給馬背上做了個鞍子，又做了踏脚蹬掛在馬的兩邊，我又做了馬口的嚼鐵和馬韁，一起交與王。</p>
<p>王令我們放在一匹馬上，於是跳上馬背，坐在鞍上握住了韁。</p>
<p>立刻瞧出他們的效用來，他很樂於有這些東西，給我大批的禮物，我更給當地大人物多做這些東西，他們所給我的禮物，不久就使我更富了。</p>

<p>— 豪</p>
<p>春天的好處。是氣候和煦。是遍野皆綠。一切的一切。莫不生機勃發。生趣盎然。</p>
<p>在上海大商店的太玻璃窗中。你如果看見了綠色和黃色的窗飾。你便知到已將近所謂「外國淸明」了。尤其是沙利文的窗子裏。懸着美國的國旗。和華盛頓的肖像。還有許多淸明蛋。你更感覺到這是春天來臨的象徵。便應該出門去舒散舒散了。</p>
<p>在上海的人們。提起春天。便會聯想到旅行。更會聯想到杭州。杭州好像是上海人們旅行的唯一目的地。上杭州去。一年一度。杭州是百主不厭的。在這裏。我便寫些關於杭州的情景。</p>
<p>這幾年。杭州是確實有進步了。柏油的馬路。可以使你坐汽車四平八穩的到了旅館。馬路上見到不少的標準鐘。鐘的柱上也有都市的紅綠廣吿。當每次列車開到城站的時候。跨過了天橋。擁擠着出了柵門。你會聽到旅館接客的一片喧嚷聲。當然。到上海。到北平。到任何大城。都有這種接客的聲音。可是到了城站。聽着高而且長的招呼聲。你便顯然地感覺此身已到杭州了。</p>
<p>其實到了杭州。在西湖裏。在馬路上。在公園裏。你都會遇到在上海所常見的熟人。或者。在上海所不能常見面的朋友。也須會一笑相逢。他鄉遇　故知。</p>
<p>春天。在杭州。一切物價。都昂貴了。浮在湖面上的小划子。在盛暑祁寒的時候。每天的代價。不過一圓。現在春天。非化了四元或五元。你準不能在湖面上逍遙。當中午的時候。小船搖到了裏西湖。船夫必殷勤勸你到樓外樓去午餐一頓。當你將西湖醋魚。炒子鷄吃飽以後。船夫在樓下也酒醉飯飽。精神抖擻的期待着。當然。船夫的飯資。你在不知不覺中已代為照付了。此外。船夫很會迎合你的心理。他會說你要說的話。他會很恭謹的簪你提取在各處買來的東西。但是你須謹防着。當一天辛勤終了的時候。你應當多付一些酒資。要不然。那臨別時的面孔。是怪難看的。</p>
<p>提起杭州的旅館。是很多了。裏西湖一帶的旅館。有很好的Lounge。很好的房聞和浴室。是專給高等洋人和華人居住的。你如果經濟寬裕。何妨踏進這些華麗的旅邸。享幾天的淸福。本來旅行是一件奢侈的事情。你何苦與自己為難。四處算省。在旅行中自尋苦趣呢。這些高等旅館。我以為最妙的所在。莫過於很長的走廊。當你在晨起或將睡的時候。躺在軟綿錦的沙發上。抽着捲烟。喝着濃茶。四圍的山色波光。將你整僩的心靈都籠罩了。當斯時。你會想起北平的西山。意大利的Forence。瑞士的interlaken。你更會想起你生平一切的浪漫事跡。</p>
<p>至於湖濱一帶的旅館。也在此報吿一番。湖濱的好處。是交通便捷。飲食方便。假使你是不歡喜寂寞的人。在午夜。在凌晨。你可以隨時到湖濱去散步。湖濱的旅館。也不能算壞呀。建築雖然沒有裏西湖高等旅館的華美。然而也可以使你住得痛快。潔白的床帷。柔軟的臥榻。你一日倦游。準會睡得酣適。</p>
<p>春天的旅館。在白日中。是靜悄悄的。這些旅客。在早上出門。薄暮回來。所以旅館中除了早晚以外。總是很寂寞的。茶房因為無事可做。在午後。總不免暢睡一回。春天原是醉人的。在暖洋洋的太陽下。露台上搖椅中。躺着肥碩的茶房。可謂痛快無比。</p>
<p>最虔誠的。是莫過於一班燒香客人了。她們背着「朝山進香」的黃布袋。不管是玉泉·韜光·北高峯。她們會一步一步的向前邁進。前途的光明幸福。誰能知道呢。</p>
<p>其實。旅行的樂趣。不在乎路趕得多少。是在乎精神上得到愉快。譬如你早上起來。走到蘇堤上散步一回。在那裏。有的是垂楊。有的是嗚禽。你可以散步着。你可以在椅上小坐。你不必顧慮一切。無疑的。這大自然的一切。全在你領域之中。或者你鼓着勇氣。一直跑上北高峯。錢塘江忽然湧現在眼前。你可以知道錢塘江所以一名之江的原因。因為在北高峯上望錢塘江。才可以看出江的形狀。的確是一個「之」字。</p>
<p>總之。杭州楚百去不厭的。在這一篇短文中。僅僅乎寫些杭州的輪廓。</p>

<p>二十九日晨七時半。驅車至鄞奉路車站。趁八時三十分車赴溪口。車資僅八角七分。（小包車須十一元。可直進入山亭）。約一小時。即達目的地。（溪口）遂步行至武嶺學校。該校為蔣氏所創辦。建築雄壯富麗。堪稱模範小學。遊畢至文昌閣。（此處為蔣氏住宅之一）被守衛所阻。據云。須得武嶺學校校長之許可證。方准入內參觀。余等乃折赴蔣氏宗祠。履愼終追遠之地。令人肅然起敬。巡視一週。顧時已十一時。遂僱奧上山。約五里許抵白岩（即蔣母墓）乃下與上山。守衛詢悉予等來此籌備旅館。頗為謙恭。幷導入自大門至蔣母墳。約三里許。兩旁松柏聳翠。修竹成林。中為碎石。路勢甚陡。直上行極感不易。况余所著係皮鞋。大有一步一躍之虞。行約二里許。　見平屋數楹。有一老嫗迎掛。導余等入內室。室中置一蔣母像。旁僅花　兩隻。餘無他物。至隔室則均係碑刻。如孫總理·譚延　·等遺跡。及其他黨國要人于右任·戴季陶·等所書之祭文。琳瑯滿壁。藉以瞻仰多數黨國元老之書法。可謂眼福不淺。觀畢。詢老嫗以蔣母墳所在。始悉尚須上山一里。此時余爽然若失。因思旣乘興而來。豈得半途而返。乃仍鼓勇上山。及至山巔。已覺疲甚。旋至墓前。視其建築。極為平凡。惟墓碑係孫總理所書。余等徘徊少頃即忽忽下山。乘與前進。不五里抵入山亭。該亭為杜月笙氏出資建築。內有雪寳寺僧人在此招待旅客。此時已下午一時。余等飢腸轆轆。即繼續前進。約五里。皆上山路。經寒華御書等亭。則本社所建之招待所。已聳然在望矣。余等先至雪實寺果腹。旋偕董　（建築招待所之營造廠監工）至招待所視察內部。觀畢。遂作妙高台之遊。</p>
<p>三十日晨。略用早餐。即偕董君等作隱潭之遊。由上雪路經西坎參觀農民讀書處。過十八折。登上雪峯。約三里許。至奉慈寺。折回至隱潭路上岔至隱潭廟。該廟內亦有數十農子在內讀書。出廟過一石橋。即為上隱潭。嗣至千丈岩。下仰止橋。（卽觀瀑橋）。旁有一亭。建築頗工。惟無人居住。狀如頽廢。倚橋仰觀千丈岩飛瀑。形聲壯美。無與比倫。過橋循亭下路而上。經御書亭返寺。已五時矣。</p>
<p>一日上午。參觀雪竇全寺。該寺為十大禪刹之一建築宏壯。寺分三幢。入門處。有蔣氏親書「四明第一山」五字。並有白菓樹兩株。茲附訂遊覽日　一則。聊供遊　者之參考。</p>
<p>第一日　晨七或八時乘　路汽車至溪口。（不久可通至入山事惟小包車已可直達）參觀武嶺學校武嶺農塲文昌閣蔣氏宗祠。</p>
<p>須先向武嶺學校校長索取許可證）再乘與至白岩遊蔣母墳。（與費自溪口至本社招待所計洋一元二角）再經入山寒華御書等亭至本招待所午餐。下午遊飛雪亭。觀千丈岩瀑布及妙高台。</p>
<p>第二日　早餐畢。乘與由上雪路經西坎。參觀雪寳農民讀書處。再遊奉慈寺。回本招待所午餐。下午遊上隱潭及下隱潭。再轉至千丈岩。下觀瀑橋返所晚餐。</p>

<p>— 俊文</p>
<p>在目前的社會裏，有不少受過中等教育甚至高等教育的女子，大家在盲目的提倡，或者實行獨身主義。雖然這種不成為主義的主義，在婦女問題中，似乎還沒有引起過偉大學者的討論；然而牠的重要性，却决不因此而有所喪失。有我們還未討論到獨身主義這問題之前，對於牠的來源不妨作一簡約的叙述。考獨身不婚的風氣，並不單限於女子一方面，男子同樣也有這種風尚。牠的最盛時代，無疑的，是在古代宗教勢力最強大而神權高於一切的當兒。因為在那時人們的意識中，以為世界上袛有神的力量最為偉大；信仰了神，不但將來死後可以　人天堂，就是在目前現實的生活上，也可以由神祇的保佑，而使你增加幸福　這樣，於是有不少的人，不惜犧牲了人生的幸福，遏止了自己的情慾，終身不婚不嫁，委身以事神；或者限定在某一個時期內，抱守獨身主義。最普遍的像佛教中的僧尼是，其次在古代如埃及希臘的祭司，羅馬守火的齋女，日本大神宮的齊宮；此外像婆羅門族的出家者，基督教中的一派，都是抱獨身主義的。這種因了神而犧牲的獨身主義，這種不道德的禁慾行為，除了足以表現出那時代人類智識的低淺外，實在更沒有其他的意義存在。</p>
<p>世界自從有人類以來，就有男女交合的事情發生；當然，這種性慾是與生俱來的。我們中國有句食色性也的老話，就是培培爾也曾說過：老處女和禁慾主義者的老靑年，在任何國家，在任何地帶，都容易被人看出來，被抑制的自然衝動的力量，是危險的證據，婦女的色情狂和各種的歇斯的利，大抵起因於此。由此卽可見阻遏性慾的衝動，是一種違背生理，違背自然的反常舉動。所以在十一世紀的時候，歐洲有許多不得不抱禁慾主義的人們，受到了羅馬淫風的影響，便以種種不合理的方法來滿足他們的慾望，因此在那時許多名為修道的庵堂寺院中的生活，比了妓院中的生活更要富於浪漫性。同時，當十字軍東征的時代，許多女于為了結婚的困難，都組織了娘子軍，到戰塲上去作兵士的安慰者。這些陳舊的事實，却有力的證明了：人類不論男性抑或是女性，對於異性者的需要，正無彼此可分。因之，從古代的一時配偶婚到今日的自由戀愛，其中制度雖是經過了多次的變遷；而婚姻依然成為一大問題者，也就是這個原因。</p>
<p>盧騷曾在他的愛彌兒一書裏說：婦女的義務，是在輔助我們男子，安慰我們男子，得男子的愛和歡心，並且為男子的慰藉者，使男子容易愉快的走到生的路上去。這話是否適當，我們暫時不說；不過男女兩性精神上需求的重要，已由此可見。把這層意思說得最透徹約，要算康德了。他說：男女相合才能成為一個完全的人，人類健康的發達，以兩性的正當的結合為基礎，性慾的滿足，是男女身體康健和精神發達的要素。至於培培爾的意見，以為人類不是禽獸，肉體的調和，不够滿足他比慾望更高尚的要求，在此非有精神調和與吸引不可，假如沒有精神，性交祗成為機械的不道德的行為而已。我們不再需要去引用他人的話，已足够證明獨身主義對於人類精神上的和諧與興奮，是背道而馳的。同時，我們在此，更可以作進一步的討論。就是目前女子所提倡的獨身主義，其原因，當然不是為了神的關係；不過她們以為結婚是加重精神上痛苦的一伴事情，尤其是從事於職業的女子，看作結婚是人生中的浪費，更有從實際的生活上觀察到的種種苦况，於是就視結婚為畏途了。其實，這種觀察，適足以表現出她們目光的短小，因為我們基於結婚的原理止來講，結婚並不是一件痛苦的事情；換句話說，為結婚而增加痛苦，阻北事業的前進，是一種畸形的現象。依理在兩性間互相鼓勵和扶助之下，對於他或她所從事的事業，該格外的有進步。所以由這精神上的需要看來，提倡獨身主義簡直是自趨滅亡。</p>
<p>一個民族的健全，一個國家的強盛，雖然不是一個單純的問題，可是國民是始終脫不了的元質。所以各國雖是在鬧着不景氣，鬧着失業，但是政府方面依舊在獎勵着生產。尤其像我們中國，因了連年的戰爭，連年的天災，加之因不知衛生而病死的人，死亡率的高，當在一切國家之上。假如在這時候再提倡所謂獨身主義，那非但不能使國家民族強健起來，而且還是一個積極的民族自殺政策。所以，站在國家的立塲上來說，這種獨身主義是决計不會需要的。</p>

<p>— 耀</p>
<p>成都通訉</p>
<p>所謂『天府之國』的文化中心，便是四川省會的成都。舉凡上海摩登婦女所享用的洋貨，在成都的百貨商店裏，是應有盡有地供給着成都的摩登婦女。而且上海婦女的摩登裝束以及戀愛方式，也是隨着各種商品以及電影戲劇流行在成都婦女的生活之各方面的。難怪有很多四川人都呌它做『小上海』吧。凡是在四川生活過的人，都要承認：有很多的各縣婦女羨慕着成都婦女們所享受的物質文化與開放的思想。但是，另外有一件事情，是我們不能不提及的：在成都布面之外，與鄉間緊接着的任何一條四通八達的馬路旁邊，却豎立着無數的『烈女碑」或『節孝坊』。這些封建的遺物，並不曾因汽車之往來於馬路而被消除。反之，它們是仍然被成千成萬的婦女們敬崇着的。不僅是鄉下的婦女，就是成都及其他都市的婦女，也不斷地到那些「烈女碑』或『節孝坊』面前去進香火。從這兩種情形看來，成都的婦女生活，顯然是排列在極端新與極端舊的兩個方式之間的。茲分段　述如下，以供一般研究社會問題者作參考。</p>
<p>（一）她們在家庭中的生活和地位</p>
<p>（甲）都市的家庭婦女</p>
<p>成者市街上的容許婦女，約可分三種：</p>
<p>第一種是富貴之家的婦女。軍官要人的太太小姐或大商人的老闆娘及大地主的女人都屬於這一類。她們是很富裕的享受着物質文明：對於僕役奴婢的使用，頗有封建貴族的氣派。她們也像那般毫無紀律的軍閥一樣，常以威勢臨人，不是坐在私包車上撞馬路上的行人，便是在公共娛樂塲所與別人爭座位。</p>
<p>第二種是中等商人或職業薪俸者及小房主的家庭婦女。她們的經濟力量雖然不及富貴之家足供自己充裕之浪費，但因她們的家庭經濟隨時處於風雨飄搖之中，在勢利的壓力之下，却更加顯得愛播弄勢利。因此，凡是這種中等家庭的婦女們，大都喜歡養奴蓄婢（在成都呌做丫頭）。各種上諂下驕的虛榮心理，在她們中間，確實很大。為自己打算盤的能力與滿口油滑的辭令，可以說是她們的特別長處。</p>
<p>第三種是比較窮苦或做手工的家庭婦女，她們的丈夫多半是苦力或小販。她們為了帮助家庭老少的生活，大部分</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>的時間都花費在替別人洗衣服，縫紉或替綢緞機房改緯綫或替織襪工廠縫襪口，以及各種類似的工作。她們比較有獨立生活的能力。可惜終年勤勞也頗不易使子女受一點必要的教育。但是，說也奇怪，她們正因為在生活上比較地領略過一些世故人情，所以她們羨慕富貴人家及中等人家的婦女之享樂與誇耀，也就特別厲害。</p>
<p>（乙）鄉村的家庭婦女</p>
<p>至於鄉村的家庭婦女，亦可分為三種：</p>
<p>第一種是豪紳婦女。她們雖然是純粹地主或糧戶，但為着有大小軍閥及團閥土豪劣紳的力量支配着的關係，所以，她們也隨着時勢傾向，一方面在粉飾自家經濟闊綽的面子，同時也做起那種貴族式太太小姐的神氣，這只須在她們與鄉間普通的人相接談的時候或穿着方面，卽可顯見其驕傲與闊綽的樣子。特別是在她們勢力所支配下的小塲鎮『辦喜神會』或『為城隍，關聖人出駕』的節日而集會時，可以隨處發現她們的威風的。</p>
<p>第二種是中農或佃農的家庭婦女。這是典型的樸素的農村婦女。她們除在家料理衣，食，住的全部工作外，　要養育小孩子。農忙時節也要跑到田野間，把小脚陷在泥田裏。她們辛苦的結果，或可勉維生活；但在苛捐雜稅使她們的家境困難的時候，每每悲嘆自己苦了一生，連　都市上替人做傭工奶媽的物質生活也沒有享受過。</p>
<p>第三種是只有二三畝田或純為別人帮工或充奶媽的家庭婦女。她們的丈夫平常也從事耕作，或為他人，或為自己，都無固定時間。暇時卽以一二元小本經營流動的生意，以販運小菜或水果煤炭各物的勞力去賺一點收入。但這微小的收入，也不敷家用；於是，她們大半被迫出門去充當傭工了。</p>
<p>（二）到學校去的她們</p>
<p>自五四運動『女子須受教育』的主張風行奈國以來，成都首先在各小，中，一大及專門學校裏開辦女生班。遠在數年以前，多數學校卽已改為男女合班了。至於那些女子師範或女子學校的人數，似乎比一般男子學校都還踴躍。一直到現在，可以說成都婦女教育的外表已經頗為可觀的了。</p>
<p>那麼，她們在學校裏究竟學得到多少眞正的知識呢？若就成都教育經費的困難，及一般教職員因生活不得保障而自欺欺人的近况而論，一般的女生當然也受不到若何及格（不是教員打分數的『及格』，而是普通應有程度的『及格』）的教育。平均一個學期只不過十二三週，至多十六七週，很少有二十週的授課；還有例假，乃至因各種風潮而停課的時候。所以，在知識的修養上，她們中十之八九都是很欠缺的。</p>
<p>再說到訓育方面呢？有許多學校確實管得較嚴格，但有許多學校卻連形式上的敷衍都沒有做到。我們曾經遇見貧苦的女學生在做私娼而與她們的「夫子大人』不期而遇，同席飲花酒的盛宴。當時是學生認識先生，而先生却不認識學生？這種原因，自然是教育機構之不完備的結果。但是，同時我們應該提及的，是那許多貴族小姐在學校之驕奢強橫的勢力，時常保障了她們行為之『校外自由』的習慣；這種習慣，老早使教職員管不着她們了。她們憑家族親友的馬弁及豢養的衛兵逞着威風。教職員們，常為了避免學校以外的糾紛，都只好睜隻眼的閉隻眼。</p>
<p>雖然，以上所述的貴族婦女與窮困一私娼似的女生，在學校裏的數量並不算多。但是，她們的摩登程度，和驕傲虛榮的脾氣，却毫無疑問地，在學校中發生領導作用，因此，那絕對多數的純潔女子，便不知不覺的遭受影響。在這樣環境之下，我曾經看見過摩登的女學生對她的同學說，她們由鄉間到成都學校給她送錢來的父母是她的『傭僕』。推其原因，大概是因為父母的衣服穿得太樸實吧！類似這種奇特情形的趣事，異常之多。自然，我們應該知道：有很多女生還是被舊家庭的潛意識緊緊地管束着的，可是，所謂進步，開通，摩登……等等的傾向，在學校裏，畢竟更有力的引誘她們。所以，學校教育，終於不曾指示她們一條眞正新女性的出路。</p>
<p>（三）追求職業的她們</p>
<p>成都近幾年來有很多的織襪廠或縫紉公司之設立。許多小實業家，曾經花費許多心血去研究如何提倡實業，並號召婦女們參加生產。因之，許多婦女也熱狂着想藉此獲得「一技之長」冀求獨立生活，或藉此改造家庭的。果然不錯，有很多婦女眞是把技能學習得很好，但是，不幸的「公司關門」，却在不久的瞬間卽宣告出來了。</p>
<p>有很多的婦女，她們從　廠裏畢業一繁，大部不能覓得正常的工作，有的則回到各縣去購置十數架機器自己從事營業，但也十有八九是失敗了的。因為那許多十紗綫（卽本地棉綫）及非電機染出的綫襪或絲襪，都不及上海或舶來品之價廉物美。縱然營業偶有門徑之人，亦因捐稅及戰爭之影響而不能不捲旗息鼓了。而且，她們目前在成都所使用着的織襪機器，大多還是上海及外國數年前的舊機器。因為那些小實業家眼看營業不振，便『見風轉柁』，把工廠變為副業，而舉辦所謂職業學校，一則藉此可收括大量的學雜費，同時還要借以推銷舊機器。在上海值價二三十元的機器，他們逼迫那些到工廠去學習的女學生，一人定購一架。其價格定為百元左右不等。殊不知，一到她們搬回家時，實際使用之後，便發現那是廢鐵了。</p>
<p>在成都，除了這種大批職業婦女在那裏顛沛流離之外，也有好幾個產科學校。但其程度之幼稚，比之上海的亂招看護士而藉以取得百元押金的野鷄產科醫院，是相差無幾的。</p>
<p>商店及寫字間採用『花瓶」的制度，現尚無人開其先例。在全市，女招待的傭用，也是找不到的。</p>
<p>至於那些以賣皮肉為生涯的職業婦女，表面上似乎及不上京滬娼妓勢力之大。但，有名的『興化街』及『五台山』兩個區域，仍是有公開向當局納花捐的。此外，有很多的私娼，她們裝做女學半或姨太太小姐的樣子，到處招蜂引蝶。她們生意雖不算壞，但其生活的悽慘，是可想而知的！</p>
<p>（四）她們的戀愛與婚姻</p>
<p>在成都的人，對於『自由戀愛』的虛偽是早已認為可怕的。所以，許多做家長的人，對於他們子女的婚姻，仍是採取『父母之命媒妁之言』的辦法。一般較為開通的父母，照例是覓得門當戶對的家庭，先把婚約議而不定，設法使子女見面一二次，只要相互間沒有很大的不滿意，在「勢利相投」之下卽可訂婚。在這樣被動的「開通』辦法之下，男子平常旣未與女性接觸，女子也似乎沒有什麼　一定成見的。因此，在這樣半自由而又半拘束的婚姻關係，决不是由愛情而結合，也不是由學問思想而結合，更不是為國家社會而結合——祇不過是多數沒落家庭藉子女的婚姻問題而追逐勢利而已。由於此種情形發生的結果，十有七八是苦悶頹廢，十有二三是準備在結婚不久之後，就到報紙上刋登離婚啟事的。所以，徹頭徹尾的說來，成都的婦女就根本很少有眞正的戀愛。實際上許多女子，都在自由或戀愛的虛名之下被封建勢力摧殘而犧牲了。</p>
<p>有不少的貧苦之家的女子，她們把成都的勢利關係看得很淸楚。有許多父母，都抱定非軍官不嫁其女兒的宗旨。因此，連排長或參謀副官之流的下級軍官，也很容易覓得戀愛或結婚的女子。但是，最不幸的女子正是她們。在大多塲合，軍官們終於把她們葬送到私娼的陣營以內去了。</p>
<p>此外，有許多小康之家的女子，嫁給那種勤勞的手藝子弟或自耕農的子弟以後，因為大家辛苦勞作與生活的合作，往往有極為美滿而眞正恩愛的無數夫妻。這是成都小市民經濟與自由農村現有的僅存碩果。她們過着『天府之國』的優美悠閒生活，連性格也變得特別和平而又厚重。所可惜的，是這樣的婦女把戀愛與生活吻合進行的數量已經逐漸减少，而且很迅速的消滅了。</p>
<p>名人訪問記</p>
<h3 id="c233">雕刻家江小鶼訪問記 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 若愚</p>
<p>由於參觀過這次上海藝術預展裏所陳列的那麽豐富的古代銅器和玉器雕刻，所給予我的印象，不覺聯想起現代的幾位從事雕刻的藝人了。</p>
<p>在這次預展裏面，我們所能看到的還不過是全部「古物的幾分之幾，然而已經足够我們花費半天的時間從事賞鑑，僅從數量上說，已經是值得使人吃了一驚。我們在看過了先代藝人所遺留下來的心血凝給成的大量「古物」，却難免不對現代的從事雕刻的藝人勾起一層綦切的期望：可是，如果回頭一看現代的雕刻藝人所成就的作品，在藝術方面的價值能否和「古物」比擬，固是疑問，但就量的方面說來，實在也是少得有點呌人氣餒。由此，我們可以想見先代藝人對藝術的努力和苦心，的確是值得一般後來從事藝術的人們追蹤取法的。</p>
<p>我因為對於雕刻這種藝術比較容易威到興趣，所以在參觀了藝術預展後出來，似乎還沒有盡興；於是，我們找到一位熟識的朋友介紹，再跑到虹橋路上去訪問了一下現代的名雕刻家江小鶼先生，因為我早就聽說他家藏有不少的雕刻作品和現代的「古物」（？）。</p>
<p>我們到達他那裏的時候，已經是下午四點鐘模樣，天氣又是那麽黑沉沉的要下雨的樣子；因此在我們見面的剎那間，孫君便急忽忽地代我說明了來意。</p>
<p>在沒有和江先生見面以前，我心裏却早就替他的形態畫好了這樣的輪廓：白净的臉孔，拖長的頭髮，穿的是西裝，說話常時會夾帶一兩句英語或法語。可是，當孫君替我介紹時，却突地使我吃了一驚，原來他的態度和面孔，恰恰和現任的中委李石曾先生沒有兩樣。一件絳色的夾袍袖子上已經有點毛茸茸地「拖鬚擺柳」；脚上穿了一雙布鞋，走動時現着很老成持重的神態。</p>
<p>他聽了孫君一番介紹，便很高興地引着我們走到一間精緻的客房裏坐下：彼此寒喧一陣，我便找着一個問題開始訪問了。</p>
<p>「最近在上海舉行的藝術預展，江先生大概去參觀過了吧？」，這個問題並不切實際，我心裏想。</p>
<p>「想去看看，可是這兩天不得空。你一定是去參觀了？」他笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「我看倒看過了，可是也等於「劉姥姥進大觀園」似的樣樣都是不懂！要是江先生去看一看，倒可以對那許多古代雕刻給予一種藝術上的評價。」我虛心的說。</p>
<p>「這却不敢輕下批評」。他微微搖了搖頭，接着說：「不過去看了以後，也許有很多的東西是值得我們學習的；我覺得一個從事藝術的人也和一個研究文學的人一樣，要虛心接受前人的遺產。先代藝術家在技巧上的成功，的確使我們這些後來的「藝徒」有點「望塵莫及」；現在祇是拿我個人來說，以一個從事雕刻生活將近二十年的人，自己始終不敢對產生的作品有一件認為成功的。由此，可以想見雕刻藝術，的確不是一椿容易幹得好的工作。」他皺緊着眉頭，顯着不很滿足的苦悶。</p>
<p>「江先生雕刻生活是從那一年開始的？」我接着問。</p>
<p>「說來話長了了，」他吸了一口烟，慢吞吞地回味着：停了一會，他說：「起先我在日本原是學畫人像，後來自己感覺到畫像這種藝術，似乎有許多地方不能整體的表現，就是畫的技巧學到了登峰造極的程度，也還是不能暢所欲為地把一個人像整體的從紙面上表現出來。所以我在日本住了五年之後，便跑到法國開始學習雕刻藝術了。在法國也足足住了五年，總算把我所要學的東西學得了一點回來；不過，我學雕刻其所以能有點心得，却要完全歸功於我學有畫像的根柢。因為學雕刻，如果沒有繪畫的經騐，却是費了許多時間而結果還是難有成就的。」</p>
<p>「江先生第一件成功的作品是什麽哩？」</p>
<p>「這却不敢說。剛才我已說過了，對自己已經完成了的作品，沒有一件敢認為是成功的。而且，我現在對於雕放刻差不多已形成了一種職業生活的狀態，對於一件作品，往往因了經濟關係受到對方的限制；彷彿像個匠人似的，對於一件作品自己雖有很好的表現，可是顧主所歡喜的却不一定是你那自稱得意的作品。如果勉強地說有一兩件作品是滿意的話，那也祇有已故的上海紗業大王吳麟書的銅像和現在的馬相伯先生的造像，不過這也祇是自己認為滿意罷了。」他哈哈地笑着：「現在這兩尊像都還在那邊廠裏，不妨走過去看看。」</p>
<p>我們從那間客房裏出來，他打前走着；經過一座小小的花園，前面不多遠就是一座白鐵搭起來的廠屋，彷彿電影場裏的「玻璃棚」似的，有着十幾畝地的範圍。</p>
<p>進門第一間便是雕刻室，在這裏放着的有幾十種已經翻過銅的石膏像和正在從事雕刻的「泥胎」。每一個沒有完工的「泥胎」上都有很厚的一塊濕布包着，好像病院裏傷了頭顱的傷兵般的，驟然看到時神經上不禁微微地戚到一陣緊縮。</p>
<p>他搶先走進這間雕刻室，忙着吩咐工人把所有的「泥胎」上的濕布都一個個地揭起來，一面告訴我說：這幾尊「泥胎」是些什麼人，雕刻的工作還有多少，經過若干的時間才可以翻成石膏模型。這麽口講指畫地娓娓的談着，彷彿一個生物學的教員對學</p>

<p>生授課似的精細。</p>
<p>最後，才看到他所說的，紗業大王吳麟書和馬相伯先生的像了。</p>
<p>吳麟書的銅像是一種坐的姿式，這在一般的紀念銅像用這種姿式却是僅見，不過雕刻的技巧，的確不是筆底下可以形容得出來的。</p>
<p>「這尊銅像的姿式，在中國恐怕還是絕無僅有的吧？」我覺得有點奇怪。</p>
<p>「是的，一般的紀念銅像都是立體的，這一個却是恰恰例外的了；但是我所認為滿意的作品也就是這個。雕刻這尊銅像時，總算思想上沒有受到限制；不過在剛剛接洽的時候，倒也費了不少的唇舌，後來還是我在報酬方面情願讓步，才算依了我的思想表現完成了這件作品。」愉快的神情充滿了在他的臉上。</p>
<p>從雕刻室走進去，就是鑄金廠了。這裏裝着二個煉銅的大爐，一架可以軋到十五噸重量的軋重機；廠屋的正中樑上高高地掛着手指般粗的三根鐵練，在這鐵練底下便有一個煉銅的火爐。把銅放在鍋爐裏熔化之後，才拿鐵練把熱銅高高的吊起，朝銅模裏面灌注，然後才成功了「銅胎」。</p>
<p>這種鑄金的設備，看起來並不見得怎麽複雜，可是一個雕刻家而兼辦鑄金的工廠，在現代的中國却還是絕無僅有的。</p>
<p>「這種鑄金的方法，在中國六朝時代就有的，不過古代的藝人常有一種不能免的惡習，往往喜歡把自己所學得的一種絕技寗可到死都不願公開傳人，因此後來這種鑄金的方法，逐漸的湮沒無聞，等到我們現在要用起來，還得巴巴地跑到外國去向人求教了！我回國之後第一次就接着了陳英士先生一個銅像，限期十個月完成；可是後來「泥胎」我倒雕刻好了，翻銅却一時沒有方法解决。如果送到日本去翻製，固然是很便利，但在時間方面却已經感到非常的侷促，同時我又覺得一個從事雕刻的人對自己的基本技術都要求人，總是不應該的。結果，我還是决心自己翻製；工人都是臨時把許多親戚家裏的包車夫和傭人找了來，訓練了一個多月，大家都對這種工作感到很濃厚的興趣，同時也學會了一些應用的技術了。陳英士先生銅像，也就在這七拚八凑的小型的鑄金廠裏面，經過九次的試騐，才在距限期還有一月的時間裏完成了我的翻銅的處女作了。現在這幾個過去做車夫的工人，已經是有了很好的翻銅技藝；最近我所有的作品，關於翻銅部份，差不多都是他們自動幹好的。」</p>
<p>他一面說着，一面把我們帶進一間很小的刻製間。這裏是兩間房連着：一間裏放着嶄新的刻銅的機器和許多刻好的大小的銅模；一間裏放着幾十種顏色斑剝的銅器，從那種形式和上面的字跡看來，一般人恐怕都不能辨認淸楚那是今人所製的膺品的。</p>
<p>「這架刻銅機，在我買來的時候，連經銷的那家洋行也不能告訴我使用的方法，而我又沒有經騐過這種機器；但是我為了想將來成就一種美術工藝，却又非買這樣一架機器不可。結果還是把它買了回來，每天我和一般工人，都像學徒似的來幹這種試騐工作；現在算是已經有點成就，刻了不少的銅模和圖章了。」他從玻璃櫥櫃裏拿出十幾種銅模和圖章給我看着。</p>
<p>「將來成立一家美術工廠，那是很容易的。」我說。</p>
<p>「做總得這樣往前做的，可是能不能順利的進行，却還是需要很大的努力呢！」他現着很虛心的神氣說。</p>
<p>旅行一周</p>
<h3 id="c236">「袁墳」之遊 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 白英</p>
<p>前兒在平漢路，雖曾兜過幾次圈子，對於緊傍鐵路的彰德城，却沒有特別下車觀過光。這次由漢口到北平，車次彰德時偶過舊友潘君，他原在鐵路上服務，最近調駐這兒，於是強邀我下車，作數日之勾留。</p>
<p>我們出了站台，撲面來的是一陣狂風夾着黃色的沙座，這種歡迎儀式幾乎使我睜不開眼睛，當下便給我幾分不好的印象。及到快要進城的當兒（車站離城約二里路），那中世紀式的傾圯的城墻，又引起我不好的感覺。鑽進了城門洞，那矮小的房屋，骯髒的街道，把我的情緒都弄得蒼老化了！</p>
<p>第二天為舊曆三月初二（淸明節前二天），潘君約我遊「袁墳」及袁家花園—所謂「袁墳」，卽袁世凱的墳墓，當地人簡稱袁墳，離彰德城約七八里，洋車可以直達，不過因為路近，我們都願步行，藉資多溜覽北方的春郊。可是北國的春郊原沒有江南那麼綺麗，兼之這天天氣陰暗，曠野更覺晦澁。而狂風不了解遊人的心情，夾着塵沙一陣一陣的向我們臉上猛撲，於是北國沒有春天的意識愈覺濃厚了！</p>
<p>快到袁墳的時候，首先接着視綫的是那巍峨矗立的屛幛，全是石質建築，高約四丈，寬有十丈開外。上面刻的「龍蟠」，「鳳舞」不甚精細，較之古舊的雕刻遜色多了。由屛幛到墳墓約二里，中隔一小小水溝，過了水溝便是寬大的柏油路（也許是「三合土」）直達墓園。</p>
<p>墓園佔地約二十畝面積，周圍遍植惻柏，扁松，將要成林了。在這沙漠似的平原裏，有這年靑的松柏點綴着，倒很覺葱綠可愛。墓園共有四進，第一進（郎頭門）內是粗石平鋪的敞壩，中央矗立一座尖角亭，下覆高約二丈的方形墓碑，碑為大理石鑲成，前面順書一大總統袁世凱之墓」，旁註「民國八年×月吉立」字樣，側後三面，並無「行狀」的叙述，當時很使我懷疑這赫赫一生的大人物，為什麽他的子孫不將他的豐功偉蹟書之墓碑，垂諸後世。如果叙述起來，就有「淸國內務大臣」，「民國大總統」，「洪憲皇帝」等頭銜。這是多麽堂皇呵！隨後我纔想起有不可叙述的理由在，於是我又佩服他的後人的聰明了！</p>
<p>第二進也是粗石平鋪的敞壩，兩邊立着獅，象，虎，豹及牛，馬；這些獸類都由大理石刻成，在這沒有石質的北力，可算珍貴的東西呢！我知道「獅」，「虎」，「豹」是象徵威武，同時又有「鎭壓邪氣」，「配置風水」的意義，而「象」是象徵多福多壽，也有深厚的理由，至於「牛」，「馬」是什麽出處和功用，我就有些模糊了。難道是表示後人有馬騎，有牛耕田？還是暗示這位「大人物」生前把人民當牛馬使役？這要「風水先生」纔能答覆了。我可不管。</p>
<p>第三進纔是墳墓，墓台有丈多高，成圓形，直徑約四丈。墓高二丈開外，直徑亦有二丈多。墓前一扇扁碑，上放刻福星，壽鳥，雕工比較精細。墓台周圍的欄打，乃石柱穿鐵鍊，正同大城市裏闊人住宅的欄杆一樣。總計墓台，墓碑，墓的本身，以及石柱，階梯，均由大理石鑲成，如果不是年月稍久，經過風雨的侵蝕，那眞是一片白色，好像走到銀世界了！</p>
<p>墓的背後有一道圍墻，由側門進去織是第四進，這裏面全是朱門粉壁的房屋，很明顯的是守墓人所住的地方了。可是我們對於每間屋子都曾窺視，並無所謂「守墓孝子」，甚至連奴僕都沒見着一個，屋裏積滿塵灰，彷彿從來沒有人跡，房門緊鎖，似乎久不開啟了。</p>
<p>墓園沒人看守，所以出入的人便無枸束，在那大理石的碑上，墓台上，發現了許多打油詩人的筆跡，其中有隨便題詠的，也有譏諷「袁公」的！至於亭子上，牌坊下，總之凡是能够遮蔽風雨的地方，都成了牧童的休息處，同時也是乞丐的寄宿舍。據說每當暑天，附近的農民大都跑到這兒來納凉，夜間也在這兒睡覺，那平坦的石板上，自然比他們那汚穢的十壩愜意多了。袁公眞不愧為一代大人物，述死後的埋骨處也蔭蔽小民。不過據說袁公的墳慕共有四處，（他是項城人，家鄉總有一座更偉大的墳墓，聽說新鄉縣還有一墓，但不知他的骸骨究竟埋在那兒的。）留在彰德的，功程最不偉大，所佔的地面也算最少，如此，則其餘三處當更有可觀了。</p>
<p>走出墓園，踏上柏油路，凉風吹着細雨一點一點的洒在我們的頭上，於是我們原先所擬定的遊了袁墳再去袁家花園的計車，便告失敗了。</p>

<p>— 村</p>
<p>中國的語言，是最複雜最不統一的，這對中國文化的統一和發展，有着很大的障碍，無怪乎許多有識之士要引以為遺憾。注音字母，普通官話的提倡，方言俚語，民間歌謠的搜集，都有過很多有心人在那裏努力，我們希望能逐漸有些成績以後，不但可以便利推進中國文化，並且也能便利旅客行人不少。</p>
<p>一般日常用語中，不但字音各地不同，造句隨空間而異，甚至有許多譬喻式的謎語夾在談話中，使你外來人聽了莫名其妙。這種謎語的採訪，一般注意語言統一的人，却從沒有提到過，而我則覺得也有搜集的必要。日常用語中的謎語成句，想來各省各地方的語言中都有，並且有些謎語也是非常有趣味的，它特別流行於鄉村中。雖然其中有許多別字和字音的訛傳，但不特於此可以看出農民的比擬譬喻的想像能力並不薄弱，而且我們也要能充分地了解他們所用的術語，才容易和他們交談，了解他們的意思。別的地方有無此種謎語雜在語言中我不知道，現在且就我們鄉間所流行的謎語，列舉些例子出來，供大家參考罷。（其中有些是很俚俗很醜的話，但因為是在研究語言，也無妨列舉出來，讀者可以不管它的意思如何）</p>

<h3 id="c239">純情詩人雪萊（一） <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 日本鶴見祐輔作周樂山戚俊夫譯</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>在那常識的，功利的英國却產生了雪萊，和拜侖，這是運命的一大惡作劇。</p>
<p>因此這二人天才的生涯，便是一幕偉大的悲劇。兩位詩人被社會的偉大的力所飄蕩，所呑吐，所呵責，像漂浮在漫漫的大水上兩滴渺小的油。</p>
<p>但是僧惡英國人所持的權力慾，金錢慾，和平凡的人生觀的人們，大概沒有一位不愛雪萊的純情，拜侖的熱血吧！英國之所以能在世上成為一偉大強國，不是因為他們的物慾，征服慾和人間操縱術，而是因為在他們的國度襄有時會產生出雪萊那樣無物慾，拜侖那樣無妥協性，穆爾那樣愚憨正直的人。英國人之偉大在於常識和非常識的不可思議的混淆。英國人只知講究胃口，所以被法蘭西人和德意志人所痛罵。然而卻產生出雪萊那樣全無胃口的人，這是英國的不可思議的力。</p>
<p>所以在生的時候那樣被迫害的雪萊，在死後的百年的那年，曾經開除過他的牛津大學却建築他的紀念像，這足證在那些愛吃肉排，好油膩，酒肥的JohnBull的五體之中還流着淸純奇矯的雪萊的血。大英帝國不僅只知鑄造呻吟在英蘭銀行的銀庫裏的金幣。</p>
<p>然而雪萊（PercyByssheShelley）究竟是怎樣的一個人呢？</p>
<p>一七九二年八月四日他生在英國的大富豪而且是舊家的ByssheSbelley男爵家裏。男爵是他的祖父。他的父親是當時下院的議員，呌做TimothyShelley。他被惠以人們所羨慕的一切幸運而生下來的。而且被付以繼承二百萬元的財產，廣大的城池，爵位，貴族院的議員席和高貴的門閥的運命。</p>
<p>他是一位古代希臘的彫刻似的美少年，窈窕的姿態，日光輝映的金髮，山上湖水似的碧澄的眸子，大理石似的潔白光滑的皮膚同，薔薇般紅潤的雙頰，高高的鼻梁兒，薄薄的紅嘴唇。</p>
<p>無論男女，只要一見他，便為他的美貌所搏。</p>
<p>他若是就這樣的生長着：繼承着富貴和爵位，受女人的稱羨，在政界，社交界明星似的過活着，那他便有了約束，但，天在他的頭的底下，放置了一件偉大的贈品，那便是他那奔放不覊的天才。</p>
<p>為了這天才的緣故，他終生受着苦難。</p>
<p>因為他不願作一位貴族政治家，享樂人生，人類才得有一卷雪萊詩集。他的淚的生涯是殘留在人類文化的殿堂中的一顆光輝燦爛的寶石。不，一切人類的幸福相進步，都是過去某些人的眼淚和受難的蔭德。人的淚絕不是無益的。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>他的悲哀從少年時代便開始了。</p>
<p>他被送進教育英國的富豪子弟的伊頓（Eton）中學。當時的伊頓是採取斯巴達式的教育，少年們的自由思想尚在萌芽之中，便被蹂躪踐踏無餘。上年級的學生對於下年級的學生像奴隸般的虐待酷使。喧嘩是被公認的。甚至被毆殺的少年也有。</p>
<p>具有少女似的美貌和獨立不覊的精神的雪萊進了這個學校之後，立刻便成為全校嘲笑的目標。在學生之間流行了一種呌做“ShelleyBait”的遊戲，他被錢校所侮弄着。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c243">保羅蒙尼說每星期二十五元亦可以快樂（上） <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>保羅蒙尼是是「亡命者者」中的主角，他的表演工夫，我們早就欣賞佩服的了。他有一天向一個新聞記者說：「我有二十五元一星期！就可以很快活了。」那新聞記者不覺疑惑起來。他問道：「眞的嗎？眞的二十五塊錢一個星期就够了嗎？」保羅蒙尼是個再誠實沒有的人了，但是在他已經成了一位明星，享受了一切成功之果之後，這實在太離奇而難以置信了。</p>
<p>保羅蒙尼聽見了這反問之後，默然了一回。他亦並不因為人家不信他的話而惱怒，但是他靜想了一回然從說道：「不錯的我說的是實話——但是有一個條件。我有了二十五塊錢一個月可以快樂——但是我必須要有些創作。」</p>
<p>不錯的，他的態度是再顯明沒有了。他從前所說過的話，現在都明白了。他曾說過：「如果我可以自由，我不一定要做明星。但是，不論明星不明星，我不願意一年之內，做兩張以上的片子……那幾張片子，亦必須要我自已選擇……我不要個人的宣傳。我亦不喜歡人家看見了我，瞪了一對大眼睛，或是請我簽名……做大人物我不在乎……社會上的名氣是不能誘惑我的……我對於我已做的一切，從來沒有覺得十分的滿意過……人家就是不知道我的名字，我亦不惱恨……我所願的是人家看了我所表演的角色，而得到一稱感觸和啟示……」</p>
<p>從以上所說的許多話，我以可以看出這位「亡命者」的主角，是有一致不移的主見的。他所要的，就是一個好的角色，而此外的一切虛名，他是滿不在乎的。</p>
<p>保羅蒙尼又說道：「我從前賺二十五塊錢一個月的時候，亦很快活。為什麼現在就辦不到呢？金錢對於我，是向來沒有多大緣份的。你看，我的家庭向來是貧窮的。但是我們却不像別的窮人，一天到晚想發財，或者羨慕有錢的人。我們沒有工夫去空想，或是羨慕。我們是一天到晚要工作的。</p>
<p>「我們工作的時候，我們很快活。我們不快活的時候，就是我們沒有工作的時候，但是我們的不快活，並不是因為我們拿不到工錢。從前我在芝加哥，我所受僱的一家戲院關了門，我在一家媒氣公司裏，得到了一個位置，薪水比我在戲院中所得的還要大。但是你想我那個時候快活嗎？當然不快活。我簡直受了大罪。受罪，因為我不能在我的事業之中向前進。」</p>
<p>我們要知道，保蒙尼是個理想家。理想家對於生活，是沒有什麼苛求或奢望的。他但求照着他的理想做去。保羅蒙尼說：「我承認我願意生活的舒適，我喜歡好的東西。我喜歡有錢，因為有了錢可以買好書，可以到音樂會，可以購買好油畫。但是那些東西，在沒有錢的人，亦可以享受的。我照舊的可以到圖書館裏去借書看，照舊的可以在休假日到美術館裏去賞鑒。到了夏天，公園裏常有音樂會，不用化什麼錢的。平常還有無錢電，不用化錢而聽到。所以，到了我每星期祇賺二十五塊的時候，我現在所享受的，到了那時還照舊的可以享受。」</p>
<p>保羅蒙尼又設道：「以上所說的話，有些似是而非，因為我亦曾告訴過人家，我的所以入電影界，就是因為電影界給我的薪俸大。有人就要問我，我旣說二十五塊錢一個星期，亦可以快活，何以又因為電影公司所給的薪水大，而拍影戲呢？不錯的我拍影戲是專為錢。但是我的要錢，却有我特別的原因，並不是為有了錢，就可以享受舒適和奢侈品。我有兩個很大的理由。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c244">評「重歸」 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>—金城映—</p>
<p>首先，我們對於劇作者王斌刻劃那些在災荒，失業，虛榮，浮華等這些浪潮中的三個女性之不幸的遭受，與英勇的掙扎這一企圖是應該欽佩的。雖是由於他取材的未能由現社會的浮面現象而進於本質的發掘，跟着處理之未能盡善，再加上製作過程中若干的限制，以致現映於銀幕上的不見怎樣成功。可是絞之同一公司之過去的出品，顯然是現者新的姿態了。</p>
<p>所謂處理不善，我們從全劇的沒有重心這一點上是可以得着說明的。作者努力地接觸了災荒，與失業這些問題，而由這些問題中相當地介紹了李小梅，順便也描繪了蔣雪君；但是他沒有從自已抓住的問題上去作深刻與廣大的開展，同時也放下所創造的人物而不給以生動的姿態與動作，就轉入在蔣小霞之愛的幻滅，被遺棄這些事實上來。因此，只能把三個女性配置在兩條綫上而所描寫的也只是浮泛的輪廓了。</p>
<p>其實在人物方面，李小梅在劇中是多餘的。在前面作者借用說明一些並不怎麼明白的蔣雪君的身世與為人，而不能很好地應用她，也就是說放棄自已所接觸而應該發揮的問題，就把她置在蔣雪君這方面，完全成為後者的影子了。倘若沒有她，作者根本地從雪君寫起時，那末不但不會感到缺少什，倒會把作者所要描寫的人更能相當地介紹給觀衆，我想。</p>
<p>次之是蕭克這人物的沒有個性。直到着完全劇，才能使入認識他是個愛情不專的浮薄少年。而在蔣小霞為所謂「戀愛自由」出走之前，雖是她的姊姊雪君略說了蕭克這「混蛋」，而他為什麼是混蛋，觀衆是絲毛不知道的。因此，倒會同情小霞的為愛情掙扎之應該，覺得姊姊的舉動是無理或多餘的了。</p>
<p>說到小霞的人格也是矛盾的，由於作者在她被遺棄後寫成一個狂吸烟捲，走路，披衣等都近於流氓，無賴的女子，因此引起觀衆對她失去同情，而寬恕了蕭克這流人的罪惡。這是個缺憾。</p>
<p>寫「經魁」門策的種租田，有「功名」的人之欠租這一事實，也是欠妥的。實際上這類功名人多半是地方的統治者，收租人。「經魁」門戶的破產，是不像一般貧苦者那樣普遍與深刻的。其實，就不是功名中人也會反對自已女兒去作人小耳婆的。至於寫田主者流的對於佃戶的壓迫，以女色甚於經濟關係，是和一般以都市資產者型來寫帶原始性的封建田主之錯誤的。</p>
<p>導演平平，畫面嫌太笨板。一面太讓主角做戲，不免太過誇張與做作。（如染病後的蔣雪君的表演）。一面却放過許多戲（如姊妹為大衣吵時的塲面）全副的單薄之感。</p>
<p>三支歌曲中以「偉大的手」較佳。配音犯了一般亂配外國小曲的通病，小梅在上海第一次打門，不知是忘了配音，還是敲着沒有聲響的門。</p>
<p>說話除了房東太太外，都矯揉造作地有着舞台意味。至於音色的沒有感情，這是演員的修養問題。</p>
<p>演技亦平平，演李小梅的雖活潑不足，純朴却有餘，那種鄉下姑娘姿態卻是一般在都市生活中成名的明星所不及的。小霞這角色容易演，可是未能有深刻的成就。</p>

<p>— 彤雲</p>
<p>需倫聽了傑姆的話，越說越不對，就跳了起來道：「他昨天晚上在這裏！這裏！我和他在一起的！從我們離開了河邊總會，直到今天早晨，他沒有到過別的地方！」她又走近了傑姆的身旁，恨恨的對着傑姆道；「請你走吧。我不能再讓彭尼斯德先生。多留你在這裏了了」。她說着，故意對着彭親暱萬狀的，拉了他坐在自己身旁。彭尼期德坐下來將光滑得像海狗的頭，靠在雪倫的肩膀上，並且用手拍着雪倫的柔荑。她還不知道，那隻手的力量，可以置人於死地哩。他還說；我們到什麼地方去結婚吧。」雪倫故意媚聲白答應着，傑好看着，無可奈何的走開了。</p>
<p>那天晚上，傑姆勃郎却又跑到彭尼斯德的地方。他是帶着巴爾一同來的。巴爾很不願意的抱怨道；「你像一只獵犬，聞到了什麼東西似的，緊追着不肯放鬆。但是你要知道，人急了造反，狗急了跳墻。你旣知道彭尼斯德是殺人的兇犯，倘使他開起槍來怎麼辦呢？」勃郎却道；「他現在不在家裏，他在聖利吉斯和……，」巴爾道；「我知道和那個洋囡囡在一起。但是，你這樣的迷上了那個洋囡囡，不見得你就一定要將殺人的罪名，釘在那個人的門上吧？」</p>
<p>傑姆且不理睬他。他說；「你站在這個木頭房子的台階上。你聽見音樂的聲音，就大喊起來，喊得越高越好。」巴爾疑惑道，「聽見了音樂？但是過了一回，他果然聽見留聲機器的聲音。他心想勃郎却有的時候像瘋魔似的有的時候又很聰明。於是他就伸直了喉龍，拚命的喊道；「我要加薪水……我是一位藝術家……拿這一點點的工錢……你當我是什麼……」他喊了又喊，喊了又喊，原來道幾句話在心來這盤算了好幾年，現在給他喊出來了。</p>
<p>一回兒傑姆走了過來道；「我呌你怎麼不喊？」巴爾一面揉着喉龍，一回道；「火星上都應該聽見了，你沒有聽見？」傑姆聽見了，心中忽然似有所悟。他自言自語道；「她在屋子裏，當然亦是一點聽不見的。他儘管在送了她回家之後，回到這裏來，將木頭屋子裏的死人，放在珠麗亞自已的汽油船裏，搖了過去，將她放在她自已屋子裏的床上……</p>
<p>巴爾道；「但是珠麗亞的汽油船，是在柏德森的船房裏發現的。那末他怎樣回來的呢？」勃郎却不耐煩以的道；「傻瓜，你沒有聽見過彭尼斯德在學校裏的時候，就是一個搖船的健將嗎。他去的時候，將小船放在大船裏，到了那裏，將大船放好了，搖了小船回來。懂得嗎，傻瓜？」</p>
<p>他說着，將那隻小船舉起來，搪掂份雨，忽然一輛汽車的燈光，照在他的身上，車子裏坐的，正是彭尼斯德和雪倫。傑姆和巴爾運忙跳進了小船搖了開來。彭尼斯德在後面喊道：「我去喊警察去警察傑姆向雪倫舉着帽子笑道：那是再好沒有了。不過要呌他們帶一個泅水的人來。珠麗亞有一只粉盒子，在這裏上岸的時候遺失了，請他們水裏尋找一下。」彭尼斯德一言不發地將雪倫扶上了岸，將她帶進了屋子。他說他要去換衣服去，就讓雪倫一個人坐着，自已退了出來。隔了幾分鐘，雪倫偶然的向窗口張望着。他看見彭尼斯德正在河裏泅水。他泅了下去，半天又泅了上來，一回又泅了下去。（未完）</p>

On the 10th, the Japanese Gendarmerie of the Puppet Datong Company in Shanhaiguan, the Puppet National Border Police Force, the Japanese Special Service Agency, and the Japanese Garrison held a meeting and decided to divide the puppet entry permit into two types.

The puppet authorities' restrictions on Chinese laborers exiting the pass have been less stringent in the past week than before.

<p>(Tianjin) Responsible authorities stated that the rapid closure of the Guantai breach was truly amazing. The reason for this was due to wind and sand silting, which was a divinely assisted success. Both sides of the Yellow River within six li are white sand, with no loess.

<h3 id="e28">Germany Expresses Willingness: to Participate in the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact; Three Countries Agree on Compromise Measures with Germany; Central European Issues Awaited Until the Mid-May Conference <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Stresa: The final meeting of the Stresa Conference adjourned at 9:30 this morning. The delegates wished to complete their discussions quickly so that they could depart for Geneva this afternoon. Today's agenda was very full, including (1) Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations; (2) the issue of the rearmament of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, which is closely related to the Little Entente countries of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia; (3) the Central European Pact, including the status of Austria. Since German leader Hitler agreed to join the Eastern European Pact, the British representative was greatly excited and will strive today to persuade Germany to re-enter European coordination. As for France's preparation to demonstrate against Germany's decision to rearm at the League of Nations Administrative Council on Sunday, it can be ignored. French figures expressed doubt about Hitler's decision to join the Eastern European Pact, but trusted the effectiveness of the League of Nations demonstration. The French hoped to gain British and Italian assistance to create a mechanism that could impose financial and economic blockades on Germany in the future if treaties continue to be violated. Italy may support France's proposal, but Britain, fearing that Germany would not comply, still does not want to be involved. It is expected that the League of Nations Administrative Council will refer the matter to a committee for review, and the result may be the shelving of the issue. According to today's news, Italy will soon present Germany with concrete measures for non-interference in Austrian affairs, which Germany has agreed to consider. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Stresa: Looking at the results of the British, French, and Italian conference, its attitude toward Germany can be summarized as follows: Germany's actions in violating the Treaty of Versailles, which have already been implemented, will be recorded by the League of Nations Administrative Council based on France's application, and no further action will be taken. As for the issues themselves, Britain will be responsible for further negotiations with Germany, this is the first point. As for the future, if unilateral treaty violations occur again, the relevant countries will resolutely implement economic sanctions, this is the second point. It is said that this compromise is a success of British diplomacy. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a telegram from Stresa today, the contents of the French resolution to be submitted to the League of Nations against Germany's rearmament include, in addition to a moral condemnation of Germany's actions, a suggestion to establish a three-person committee to discuss how to use economic and financial sanctions to prevent the continuation of unilateral denials of treaties. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Stresa: Britain and France have requested Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to issue invitations before the end of April to hold a conference of Danube countries in Italy in mid-May. The location of the conference has not yet been determined, but it will likely be in Rome. Austria's neighbors, such as Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, as well as France and Italy, will participate in the conference. The participation of Romania and Poland is also under consideration. The purpose of this conference is to sign a concrete agreement to protect Austria's independence. It is also possible to conclude a Danube Pact. Britain's decision to support France and Italy's policy towards Austria has led to the decision to convene this new conference. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The major powers related to the Central European Pact will meet in Rome on May 20, as decided by the French and Italian representatives at the Stresa conference this morning. At that time, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Poland, Hungary, and the Little Entente countries will send representatives to participate. The talks this morning were quite extensive. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini advocated the rearmament of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria this morning. Although Britain expressed sympathy, French Foreign Minister Laval strongly stated the danger of hastily deciding on such an important matter. It is believed that Britain, France, and Italy will soon issue a statement reiterating that they will not allow foreign interference in Austrian affairs. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Three-Power Conference Achieves Tangible Results; Britain Continues to Urge Germany to Return to the League of Nations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Stresa: The Stresa Conference has achieved the following tangible results:</p>
<p>(1) Germany is now willing to join the Eastern European Pact, even if several signatory countries conclude mutual assistance agreements separately and record them in another document.</p>
<p>(2) France and Italy have decided on a concise agreement to guarantee Austria's independence.</p>
<p>(3) Britain and Italy agree to support France in appealing to the League of Nations regarding Germany's implementation of compulsory military service.</p>
<p>(4) Britain is now making renewed efforts to persuade Germany to rejoin the League of Nations. Germany's willingness to participate in the Eastern European Pact was announced by British Foreign Secretary Simon at yesterday afternoon's meeting. Other representatives were surprised and delighted upon hearing this. The news was relayed by German Foreign Minister Neurath to the British Ambassador in Berlin, who telegraphed it to Simon. When announcing the news, Simon also stated that Britain is willing to consult with Germany again before making any decisions regarding the overall European situation.</p>
<p>Berlin now says that the German government's move is due to the expressions of goodwill from other countries, and therefore Germany is making this major concession. It is expected that Germany's change of attitude will have a profound impact, not only on the outcome of the Stresa Conference but also on the overall European situation. Germany's decision is particularly welcomed by the Polish government. Previously, France and Russia had agreed in principle that if Germany and Poland refused to participate in the Eastern European Pact, then France and Russia would conclude an agreement themselves. Poland was in a difficult position, but now that Germany does not object to the Franco-Russian agreement, Poland has no reason to dislike it.</p>
<p>Another important result of the conference is that France and Italy have decided on a concise agreement to guarantee Austria's independence. Hitler has expressed his willingness to study the agreement.</p>
<p>At the same time, Britain's renewed efforts to invite Germany to rejoin the League of Nations are also seen as one of the major results of the conference. The conference will close today.</p>
<p>Italy and Britain now agree to support France's appeal to the League of Nations regarding Germany's violation of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. It is reported that a resolution opposing Germany's actions will be drafted by the Council of the League of Nations. The French representative has explained in detail to the Italian and British representatives the reasons for the French government's appeal, and the Italian and British representatives have made this decision. The representatives' opinion is that the final resolution to be submitted in Geneva should stipulate that the League of Nations closely study ways to prevent the continuation of unilateral actions denying treaty obligations. Regarding the issue of sanctions, the representatives have not reached an agreement. The conference also decided to continue studying the Air Pact and explicitly stated the positions of Britain and Italy.</p>
<p>It is expected that a large conference involving all relevant countries will now be held. According to widespread rumors, this conference may be held in London. This conference will lay the foundation for the two treaties mentioned by Simon, which will allow League of Nations member states, including Germany, the United States, and Japan, to join.</p>
<p>According to a formal French statement, Britain, France, and Italy, in view of Germany's rearmament, have unanimously decided that the organization of European security must be strengthened. It is reported that France's plan has been prepared and will be implemented soon. Italy is also preparing to do the same.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation, it is not impossible for the conference to be extended to Sunday, as the issues of disarmament and Germany's return to the League of Nations have not yet been discussed. In addition, the drafting committee for the final communiqué still has much work to do.</p>
<p>It is reported that the issue of allowing Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria to rearm was also discussed, but the representatives did not delve into this issue. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini agreed that any expansion of the armaments of the three countries must depend on the attitude of the Little Entente (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia). It is reported that the only condition put forward by Germany for joining the European Pact is that the two pacts must be completely separate and not combined into one document: one is the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact, and the other is a separate and supplementary Mutual Assistance Pact, to be concluded by the willing countries. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Stresa: The tone of the memorandum submitted by France to the League of Nations has been softened in order to accommodate Germany's new attitude. A British spokesperson declared that Britain, France, and Italy have now established a general agreement as follows: (1) the three countries' attitude towards Germany's specific unilateral abandonment of the treaty; (2) measures to deal with future unilateral abandonment of military clauses in the treaty. At the meeting yesterday morning, the French delegation published a secret report on German armaments. Prime Minister Flandin solemnly expressed France's concerns about security and its due preparations. However, it is reported that since Germany has made new expressions, future meetings may take a completely new path. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Stresa: The Havas News Agency's correspondent stationed in Stresa believes that the Stresa Conference has now achieved its intended goals and can be officially closed on Saturday or Sunday. The three governments have unanimously decided that the three countries should maintain close ties regarding the French government's application to the Council of the League of Nations regarding Germany's rearmament. In addition, the representatives of the three countries unanimously advocated that the European security organization should increase its strength. France has taken the lead in initiating methods to strengthen the security organization, and good results can be obtained in a short period of time. Italy is also preparing to take the same path, but Britain is taking a more reserved attitude. Britain believes that without further consultation with Germany to obtain a responsible statement from the German government leaders, substantial progress may not be easily achieved. However, such consultations do not necessarily require a separate meeting to be convened with Germany's participation. In short, Britain will be responsible for conducting consultations with Germany, but the negotiations currently underway between the various governments regarding the establishment of supplementary security systems can still proceed as usual and will not be hindered by the consultations with Germany. The planned diplomatic procedures in the next few weeks will therefore not be changed. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Germany's Agreement to Participate in the Eastern European Pact Causes a Sensation in Berlin <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Foreign Minister Neurath informed the British Ambassador to Germany that Germany was prepared to join the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact. This shows that Germany has now changed its original attitude towards the Eastern European Pact. This news came from foreign sources, and political figures in Berlin were quite sensationalized upon hearing it. However, Germany's exact attitude is still unknown. Yesterday, British representative to Germany Newton met with Neurath and inquired about Germany's attitude if other countries concluded the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. After consultations between Neurath and Hitler, he replied that Germany still considered it inappropriate to conclude the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, but Germany, while opposing the Mutual Assistance Pact, could still sign the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Germany's decision to participate in the Eastern European Pact is a major step forward compared to the opinions expressed by German representatives to Simon and Eden during their recent visit to Berlin. Responsible sources in London claim that at that time, the German representatives expressed support for multilateral pacts that did not contain arbitrarily selected guarantees. The significant meaning of Germany's new decision lies in its agreement to arbitrarily selected guarantees. This change in opinion may have important consequences. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the opinion of most observers here, Germany's preparation to participate in the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact does not provide much assistance in various matters. They now believe that only Germany's participation in the Mutual Assistance Pact would be valuable, but Germany's willingness to sign the Non-Aggression Pact is also sufficient to indicate its willingness to cooperate with other countries. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Stresa: Regarding the German government's preparation to sign the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact, some people here believe that Germany's attitude has changed and it is willing to cooperate with other countries again. Most people believe that this approach by Germany has no real value and is still of no practical help unless it signs the Mutual Assistance Pact. The so-called Non-Aggression Pact only reiterates the existing restrictions, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact. What Germany intends to do should be inquired by the British government. French Foreign Minister Laval, without waiting for the results of the inquiry, will still go to Moscow on the scheduled date in order to sign the Franco-Russian agreement. The outline of this agreement has been agreed upon in Paris. When Laval goes to Geneva to participate in the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, he will jointly confirm it with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. The last item discussed at the Stresa Conference was the Western European Air Pact plan, with particular emphasis on the mutual assistance measures between the British and Italian air forces, and it is scheduled to end its work today. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Stresa Conference, the impression obtained by various newspapers can be represented by the views of The Times, which stated: "The countries of Europe, feeling threatened, have been prompted by this conference to unite, and the desire of the countries to see Germany return to the League of Nations, and the will of the countries to continue to work towards this end while a glimmer of hope remains, have also been expressed by this conference." The Daily Mail believes that the Stresa Conference is a prelude to another expanded conference that will accommodate Germany's participation. The Daily Telegraph reported that what British policy has always been concerned about is Germany's return to the League of Nations. The newspaper also quoted the conditions put forward by German leader Hitler for returning to the League of Nations, namely, demanding the return of pre-war colonies or accepting a mandate to govern them. In addition, Foreign Secretary Simon stated at the Stresa Conference yesterday that Germany was prepared to participate in the Northeast European Non-Aggression Pact. The opinion expressed by the various newspapers can be represented by the views of the Daily Telegraph, which stated that "the security guarantees that can be given by the non-aggression pact proposed by Germany differ greatly from those already given by the Covenant of the League of Nations. It has already been acknowledged by that country that the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, which is being carried out by France, Russia, and Czechoslovakia, should not be regarded as an obstacle to Germany's participation in the work of the peace organization." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berlin Evening News published an article written by a reporter stationed in Stresa, saying, "The three-power conference of Britain, France, and Italy is an important international conference. Since 1914, only the Stresa Conference can be called a true 'peace conference.' The three major countries that signed the Treaty of Versailles have in fact recognized Germany's equal right to armament. As for the compromise reached by Britain, France, and Italy on the application to the Council of the League of Nations, it is nothing more than a mutual reconciliation to deal with the past and embellish the façade."

<p>Stresa: The three-power conference of Britain, Japan, France, and Italy discussed the issue of the rearmament of Central European countries. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated to the representatives of Britain and France that the Austrian army currently has only 30,000 troops, which poses a great danger to its territorial independence and political integrity. Furthermore, it seems inappropriate to disarm Germany's neighbors while Germany has illegally rearmed. French Foreign Minister Laval then spoke, saying that there would be many problems if Central European countries suddenly decided to rearm. If the Little Entente saw the neighboring three countries of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria rearm, they would inevitably be alarmed. Furthermore, the current balance of power among Central European countries should not be disrupted until prior arrangements have been made. It would inevitably cause the Central European countries to be alarmed if they decided to rearm before the appropriate time. In short, maintaining peace is the most important thing. Therefore, all countries concerned, whether they are former allies or former enemies, should not take such measures without common agreement. Finally, the three-power conference decided that this issue could not be resolved at the Stresa Conference and should be resolved by other means in the future. The afternoon meeting today will be devoted to discussing the Air Pact issue. In addition, today's meeting will also consider the benefits of Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey concluding the Eastern Mediterranean Pact. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Stresa: Today is the last day of the three-power conference of Britain, France, and Italy. French Foreign Minister Laval will probably leave here tomorrow morning to go to Geneva. Before the Council of the League of Nations meets, Laval will first meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and the foreign ministers of the three Little Entente countries. As for the French government's memorandum to the Council of the League of Nations regarding Germany's rearmament, it will probably be released at noon tomorrow. Furthermore, Germany's proposal to join the Eastern European Non-Aggression Treaty is generally regarded as Germany's willingness to cooperate, but diplomatic circles believe that concluding such a pact has no real significant effect, as the Non-Aggression Pact already stipulates the principle of non-aggression, making it unnecessary. In the future, Britain will be responsible for inquiring about Germany's true intentions, while Laval will proceed to Moscow according to the original plan to sign the Franco-Russian agreement with the Soviet Union.

<p>(Washington) 150,000 students across the United States went on strike for an hour today to protest against war. However, riots occurred in various schools in Los Angeles, with the most serious incidents occurring at the University of Los Angeles. Police injured two female students with batons, and more than a dozen other students were also beaten. Several police officers were also slightly injured. This strike was well-organized. Students from hundreds of schools suddenly held meetings at noon and held demonstrations. Classrooms in schools of all sizes were empty. Student leaders expressed satisfaction with the students' unanimous response. The demonstrations held here were quite orderly, and the police adopted a non-interventionist attitude. When passing through Pennsylvania Avenue, a large number of students went to the White House to submit a petition to the President, which stated, "We solemnly swear today that we do not want to defend the government's engagement in any war."

<h3 id="e36">How Will Various Industries Cope After Overcoming the "Four-End" Deadline? <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The problem of recovering long-term loans, which was considered the biggest obstacle after the year-end closing of accounts last winter, now seems to have a stable solution in sight. The Money Trade Association decided at its meeting the other day that each money shop would, within its capacity, make changes to overdue loans in order to fulfill the purpose of supporting industry and commerce. Furthermore, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are also planning to continue to follow the methods used before last year's year-end closing of accounts by disbursing huge sums of money to relieve the market. There is also talk that the industrial and commercial credit small loans of the banking industry, regardless of whether the government's 2.5 million yuan is allocated, will definitely be lent out before the end of April. All of these are sufficient to stabilize people's minds and maintain the market.</p>
<p>However, things in the world often seem to pass safely in times of temporary or difficult circumstances. But at other times, some minor factor may overturn the situation. Trouble often arises from what is overlooked. Therefore, although the "four-end" deadline can be overcome, the days ahead are long, and the dangers have not yet disappeared. Therefore, it seems that we must be cautious in the aftermath. Here, I will present some simple and easily understood points.</p>
<p>(1) The fact that the "four-end" loan problem was able to be overcome through the joint efforts and division of labor of the silver and money industries is truly an excellent phenomenon. It is hoped that this spirit will continue to be upheld and sustained. Big banks and small banks, money shops and banks, and silver and money industries and various industries can all extend mutual assistance and embrace the idea of coexistence and common prosperity. They must abandon the accumulated habits of infighting and make harmony their mission. Since the market has not yet fully become optimistic, they must act as one member of the market. What would I be without you? Sharing a leaky boat, it is definitely not possible to seek temporary peace by "sweeping the snow from one's own doorstep." It is even more impossible to harbor schadenfreude and hope that others will fail so that I can survive. All of us, apart from working together, can hardly hope to "get through lean years and have good years."</p>
<p>(2) Among the various industries, the operations vary, but in the entire market, there is no place where there is no connection, whether visible or invisible. It would be best to warn and eliminate in the invisible any accidents that are deemed sufficient to cause unease and harm the market. Otherwise, if it is not possible to make amends and its impact is not significant, resulting only in one's own unease, then so be it. Otherwise, efforts should be made to assist them so that they can get through the current situation and then rectify their future. One should not blame the past, saying that it is a deserved retribution, and sit idly by and not help. One must know where people's hearts are going, regardless of the depths. A hasty mood is difficult to contain once it has been released. A single spark can start a prairie fire, so one must be cautious.</p>
<p>(3) Discard selfish and self-serving thoughts. When making careful calculations, think of others and consider your own future. Those who possess huge wealth have usually exhausted the enjoyment of the world. When adversity comes, they do not reflect on themselves, but want to transfer their losses to the public. Their calculations are clever. But they do not think that the difficulties they are facing today are mostly caused by the past. The fruit has already been eaten, but they still want to plant the evil cause of the future. Even if the immediate wound is healed, I am afraid that it will be in vain and only show that it is harming others and not benefiting oneself. We hope that the current relief of the market can be based on the interests of the majority and not on the private interests of the minority. The Shantou white ticket incident can serve as a profound lesson.</p>
<p>(4) Since overseas financial turmoil has occurred repeatedly, baseless rumors have also occurred in the domestic market, causing people to be alarmed and to see everything as a tiger. But since Kong and Song have repeatedly stated that the people have gradually understood the soundness of the government's policies and will definitely not take risky measures. In his speech, Song also mentioned Song Hanzhang's appointment as general manager of the Bank of China, saying that "he worked hard to prevent the Bank of China's banknotes from stopping redemption during the Yuan Shikai era. This appointment as general manager is deeply gratifying." The implication is even more imaginable. What would not be done in the Yuan Shikai era, how could it be done today? Since the authorities have shown people their trust, people should also repay them with trust. Mutual trust will stabilize people's minds and stabilize the market. Accumulated savings will be released and credit will be abundant.</p>

<h3 id="e39">World Silver Prices Continue to Soar; US Believes Roosevelt Aims to Suppress Silver Faction; Bank of Japan Raises Price to Four Yen, Unprecedented Since the European War <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(New York) World silver prices continue to soar, hence rumors are rampant in the market here today, saying that the US Treasury Department will again raise silver prices. The quoted silver price in New York is 68.5 cents per ounce, which is the highest point since January 1926. Merchants generally expect silver prices to continue rising. It is heard that this surge is partly stimulated by the remarks of Senator Pittman, who announced that President Roosevelt intends to raise the Treasury Department's silver purchase price to $1.29 in an orderly manner. According to the Treasury Department's latest report, as of March 29, the Treasury Department held a total of 457,000,000 ounces of silver, including: (1) 62,500,000 ounces held before the silver program was established; (2) 111,900,000 ounces purchased after the implementation of the nationalization policy; (3) 114,400,000 ounces purchased on the open market; (4) 2,800,000 ounces of subsidiary coins. If calculated based on the existing amount of $8,614,000,000 and assuming a silver price of $1.29 per ounce, the US government must continue to purchase 1,101,550,000 ounces of silver to meet the gold-silver ratio of 2:1. However, this amount actually exceeds the total available supply in the world. Today, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet company issued a surprising forecast, saying that we will soon see an amazing development in business in the past 25 years. This statement has attracted the attention of the business community, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has seen prices surge as a result. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued a statement today denying rumors that the Treasury Department is currently using equalization funds to stabilize public stock prices, saying that this is illegal. The House Interstate Commerce Committee has held meetings to investigate whether there is any reason for such rumors, so the Treasury Secretary quickly issued this denial. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Well-informed observers today generally believe that President Roosevelt's proposal to raise silver prices is intended to suppress the congressional silver faction's requirement of a gold-silver ratio of 16:1. However, this move by the government has apparently failed to discourage the silver faction. Congressman Murdock today proposed a bill to the House of Representatives stipulating that gold and silver be fixed currencies. Murdock's proposal does not specify the gold-silver ratio, but advocates authorizing the Treasury Department to control the market prices of gold and silver. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(New York) After the Treasury Department stipulated that the price of raw silver be 71.11 cents per ounce, merchants unanimously predicted that the Treasury Department would further raise silver prices. The government's second step will be to reduce minting fees to 40%, thereby raising silver prices to 77.58 cents. Silver merchants here are particularly concerned about China's reaction to the gradual increase in silver prices. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Mexico. The Mexican government hopes that the silver mining tax can bring in 72 million pesos annually. Speculators are competing to buy silver today in anticipation of continued price increases. It is heard that banks are also competing to buy silver coins. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Ambassador Saito in the United States, the US President raised the price of domestically produced silver to 71 cents per ounce on the 10th. According to an investigation by the US Treasury Department on April 8, the number of silver holdings was 915 million yuan, and the number of gold holdings was 8.6 billion yuan. To reform the gold-silver reserve ratio of 3:1, the government needs to buy 1.95 billion yuan of silver. Now, when China and the United States are conducting negotiations focusing on the issue of the outflow of Chinese silver, the US government's move to raise silver prices is quite noteworthy. According to a foreign telegram from London on the 13th, due to the soaring silver prices in London, the Japanese financial community had no choice but to raise silver prices from 1.861 yuan to 3.911 yuan. Such a silver price of nearly four yuan has not been seen since the World War. According to observations by the Japanese Suiyokai (Wednesday Society), silver prices are likely to continue to rise in the future. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News commented on the relationship between the US silver policy and Far East diplomacy, saying, "The US silver purchase policy has caused a reaction in China, but the US authorities have ignored it. Chinese public opinion has therefore become increasingly unhappy. Japanese diplomacy aims to increase Japan's influence in China by promoting cooperation between China and Japan. Now, because the United States continues to raise silver prices, Japan's policy has become more successful. Recently, there has been much talk about British and American loans to China. It is doubtful whether these loans can become a reality. Even if British and American loans are successful, Chinese public opinion may not forget the pain caused by the US silver purchase policy." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Express today commented on the US Treasury Department's increase in silver purchase prices, saying that the US silver situation has a humorous flavor. What President Roosevelt fears most is the expansion of Japanese influence in China, but his consultations with domestic parties related to silver are precisely helping what he fears most. Japan knows very well that President Roosevelt's silver policy will worsen China's economic situation, so it can wait and see when China will be unable to resist Japanese aggression. The Financial News said that the US silver policy will drive China into the arms of Japan. Even if British and American loans can be realized, they may not be able to make the Chinese people forget the pain inflicted by the US's reckless silver policy. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Guo Taiqi's Speech: Progress in Sino-Foreign Relations <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Minister Guo Taiqi delivered a speech today at the Scottish Association of China in Edinburgh, saying that there has been significant progress in the relationship between the international community and China, which is deeply gratifying. In the past, when various countries interacted with China, they often regarded China as a true "Celestial Kingdom." In other words, they regarded China as a country on another planet. Their relationship was superficial and not genuine. Up to now, China's communication with other countries and its political and commercial relations have been completely changed. In terms of trade, most economists are seeking ways to remedy the stagnant state of global commerce and finance, and they all say that improving trade with China is the key. In terms of politics, the important issues recognized by the governments of Europe and the United States invariably have a bearing on China's survival. This truth has been recognized by the general public for several years, and it was particularly evident last year. This is indeed the best sign of the world's return to equilibrium, and the progress that China has worked hard to achieve last year has also been consolidated as a result. I firmly believe that China has no sense of fear towards the Western Hemisphere, nor does it go against it and isolate itself. If people say that China will re-adopt the "Asia for Asians" policy, it is tantamount to saying that China is unwilling to handle international relations with a broad mind, which is indeed inconceivable. Recently, there have been many rumors about China's neighbor, Japan. It is said that Japan is trying to persuade China, saying that the "Asia for Asians" policy is more suitable for China, and it has explained it in detail. I have heard people say that if Japan has such a plan, even if it spends all its money and efforts, the future of the Asian continent will definitely be hopeless as a result. This is not a blessing for China, nor is it beneficial to Japan. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>(London) At a debate held by the Leysian Club today, Lord Marley, leader of the opposition in the Upper House, who traveled to Shanghai in 1932 and planned to initiate an anti-war conference, proposed a motion entitled "China Should Be Allowed Freedom to Decide Its Own Future." In his speech, Marley severely criticized European missionaries in China, saying that the clergy had seized positions in China through a kind of extremely deceptive international behavior that is rare in the world. A Sino-French treaty drafted by a certain Catholic priest stipulated that the meaning of the treaty should be based on the French text. There was a clause that was only found in the French text but not in the Chinese text. This clause allowed the church to acquire land. As a result, the church purchased the best land and maintained its ownership by force. He also said that the most egregious pioneering behavior he had ever heard of was seen in Annam. Mr. Mackeefley opposed the motion, saying that the various things done by the British in China had improved the situation of its people. The motion was ultimately defeated by six votes.

<p>(Washington) Philippine Senate President Quezon declared today after a meeting at the White House that President Roosevelt insists on the policy of Philippine independence and hopes to establish an autonomous government as soon as possible. I have informed the President of the gratitude of the Filipino people and the proper handling by Governor-General Murphy. Quezon and Murphy will remain in Washington to continue meeting with the President, but other Philippine representatives are scheduled to return to the Philippines on Monday. It is understood that although officials claim that the talks are limited to discussing the organization of an autonomous government, Quezon's extended stay here is enough to indicate that the US-Philippine talks have expanded in scope. Quezon was optimistic after talking with the President, saying that we had discussed organizing a fact-finding mission to examine the commercial relations between the two countries after the establishment of an autonomous government. The Mixed Committee is now the official committee to negotiate with the Philippine delegation. The first joint meeting will be held in Manila or Washington to prepare the necessary laws for the congressional meeting in January next year. Quezon further stated that we are currently considering discussing the textile industry issue when the parliament meets in July. We do not want to raise the living standards of the Filipino people, but we want to find a way to prevent the American textile industry from losing the Philippine market. However, this matter has not been thoroughly considered. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>Taipei. The No. 32 well of the Jinshui Oil Field, Taiwan's deepest oil well, suddenly caught fire on the evening of the 11th. 100 million cubic feet of kerosene were sprayed out per day, turning into flames as high as 40 meters, presenting a tragic scene. All kinds of machinery were melted by the heat. The cause of the fire was that when the oil well was dug to a depth of 1,500 meters, methane gas suddenly erupted, touching the power lines and causing the fire. Fire prevention work is now being carried out with utmost effort, but it will take seven days to extinguish the fire. The damage is estimated to be no less than one million yuan. (Nichiren, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e88">Notes on Northwest Inspection <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Pingliang, the First City of Eastern Gansu</p>
<p>Pingliang is the most prosperous area among the seventeen counties in eastern Gansu, leaning against the Liupan Mountains in the west, controlling the Longban area in the south, reaching Ningxia in the north, and connecting to Chang'an in the east. The city borders the right side of the Jing River, with tall buildings and a hub of vehicles and horses. The markets are prosperous, and industry and commerce are relatively developed. The county is 160 li long from east to west and 110 li wide from north to south, covering an area of approximately 170,000 square li, with a population of approximately 240,000. The annual tax revenue and grain revenue total approximately 28,000 yuan. The main product is wheat. Thanks to irrigation from mountain springs and the Jing River, it has been self-sufficient in recent years and can also be exported to Shaanxi or southern Gansu. The next product is fur. Local sheepskin is sold for eight yuan per piece, which can be used to make greatcoats. The wool is interwoven diagonally, resembling floating silk from outside Lanzhou. It is soft, warm, and very suitable for winter clothing in the Northwest. There are also Haiyuan fur coats, which can be used as Ningxia beach fur. Shops sell both, and it is difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake. Commerce was very developed in the 13th and 14th years of the Republic, but gradually declined after the great drought in the 17th and 18th years and the conflict between Sun Weiru and Chen Guizhang in the 20th year. Moreover, due to convenient transportation, goods from Shaanxi and Lanzhou can be transported directly, and it has recently lost its position as a hub for passenger and freight traffic. However, the number of opium businesses has increased from dozens to over two hundred, showing a distorted development, not including opium dens. Opium addicts account for approximately 30%.</p>
<p>Industry includes the government-run Minsheng Factory, which produces carpets, towels, and leggings. The Fulong Match Company was founded by Zhang Dingchen, the former garrison commander. After several suspensions, it is now maintained by the Chamber of Commerce and can barely produce goods. The Coal Company produces coal worth approximately 10,000 yuan annually. Compared to Minsheng and Fulong, it is promising. The most abundant coal reserves are found in the Tugudui mining area. According to mining experts, the coal reserves can supply the entire Gansu Province for 300 years. Currently, most of the fuel in eastern Gansu comes from this area. However, due to limited capital, manual mining is mostly used, resulting in a shortage of supply. Moreover, many good coal seams have excessive water content that cannot be drained, causing the goods to be abandoned on the ground. In the future, when the Longhai Railway extends westward, converting to mechanical mining will bring unlimited profits.</p>
<p>This spring, the price of wheat flour is three yuan per hundred jin, wheat is seven or eight jiao per dou (40 jin), meat is nine jin per yuan, clear oil is ten jin per yuan, and cabbage is four hundred jin per yuan. Textiles and daily necessities come from the east, and their prices are about one and a half times higher than in Tianjin and Shanghai. Large pieces of coal weigh 70 to 80 jin per "zhuang" (sack) and cost over three mao, while slag coal costs two mao. Transporting coal to the city by donkey costs one yuan per hundred jin. It is said that the Central First Division unit in Tianshui, southern Gansu, requires five yuan per person per month for food, while three yuan is sufficient here. The standard of living is on average half that of Lanzhou, but it is still common for people to struggle to make ends meet, especially with the collapse of the rural economy. Merchants dare not extend credit to rural areas, and there is no cooperative organization. Farmers have no access to loans and have to sell livestock and grain cheaply to meet urgent needs, making their livelihoods extremely difficult.</p>
<p>There are three provincial schools: the Second Middle School, the Seventh Normal School, and the Second Girls' Normal School. The Second Middle School has over 400 students, while the other two schools each have 120-130 students. The county has eleven elementary schools and three affiliated public schools. Few parents know to send their children to school, and due to economic difficulties, many drop out halfway. Most students are from poor families, especially in elementary schools. Therefore, all schools waive tuition fees. The graduation exam held at the end of the 23rd year had a passing rate of 80%, which is a considerable achievement. However, it is regrettable that such a large city lacks facilities such as a public education hall, library, and reading room. It is said that very few people subscribe to the "New Long Daily."</p>
<p>There are scenic spots such as Willow Lake, Parks, Kongtong Mountain, and the Dragon King Temple. Willow Lake is located below the north city and was formerly the Willow Lake Academy, now converted into the Seventh Normal School. I once visited it and saw the words "Willow Lake" on the plaque of the gate (i.e., the school gate), with a couplet on the right saying "People rest by the willow" and on the upper left saying "Spring comes on the lake." Upon entering, I saw the plaque "Willow Lake Academy," originally inscribed by Zuo Zongtang. The garden has Hanyutang and Leyuting pavilions, where one can sit and rest. The scenery is beautiful, with willow colors and lake light being the best features. Dozens of steps in front of the garden, a spring gurgles from the ground, with green leaves growing in it, resembling plantain. It drifts along the stream, with the same color in winter and summer. The city is built on a slope, and the northeast gates are upward when entering the city. Small carts and rickshaws require a lot of effort. The Zhongshan Bridge has protruding road surfaces on both ends, making it inconvenient to go up and down. If the road surface can be filled in and the slope reduced, it would greatly benefit traffic. I visited County Magistrate Wang Kai in the evening and talked until about eight o'clock before returning to the Northwest Hotel. Upon exiting the east gate, although there were guards, there was no light in the darkness. I groped in the dark, worrying about falling. After passing Zhongshan Bridge, the city was crowded with people, and the traffic was heavy. People with opium faces were shouting, "Who wants a pair of padded pants?" "Who wants the key to the general dismounting?" The shouts were deafening. However, it was quiet soon after nightfall. As I approached the hotel, people were performing rituals to redeem the souls of the dead, setting up incense tables on the street, with bright lights. Taoist priests were playing flutes and cymbals, reciting scriptures, and offering a paper tablet with the words "True Nature of the Ma Family, Soul Position." A middle-aged man knelt beside him, continuously burning paper money in a bucket, with a kitchen knife placed on the rim of the bucket. Also, after the death of people in Anxi, Taoist priests must recite scriptures to the well, tie a copper cup with a red thread, and sprinkle water in all directions. After burning half of the paper money, they throw it into the air, relying on the heat to fly high and dance like ash butterflies. I don't know what the purpose is. When I returned to the hotel and went to bed, the sound of gongs and drums from the theater was still carried by the wind, becoming clearer and clearer. This is perhaps the only embellishment of the night.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Panic in Osaka Meat Market Due to Impact of China-Japan Exchange Rate and Interruption of Shandong Cattle Imports <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported on the 5th of this month that due to the recent increase in silver prices, there has been a sudden change in the China-Japan exchange rate. Most of the beef consumed in Osaka is imported from Qingdao, averaging over 50,000 heads per year. This beef is inexpensive and of good quality, sufficient to meet the needs of the people of Osaka. Unexpectedly, due to the exchange rate relationship with China this year, imports have been completely interrupted. The number of Manchurian cattle imported from Dalian and Lushun is only 700 heads. Osaka, which has the largest beef consumption in Japan, has been severely affected by this blow, creating a significant problem. The total beef consumption in Japan is approximately 300,000 heads per year, while domestic production is only 110,000 heads. If this continues, it will be necessary to slaughter domestic bulls to replace Qingdao cattle. Although approximately 70,000 heads have been imported from Korea as an emergency measure recently, it is still not enough to meet social needs.</p>

<p>Hankou Dispatch: The remnants of the He Long and Xiao Ke bandits have been entrenched in western Hunan for four months. Last month, the Hunan and Hubei armies, led by He Jian and Xu Yuanquan respectively, launched a joint campaign to suppress them, repeatedly thwarting the bandit offensive. The Hunan army first captured Dayong, and the Hubei army also captured Sangzhi. Recently, Yongshun County was also recovered by the Hunan army, which joined forces with the Hubei army to pursue the bandits. Due to overwhelming pressure, the bandits moved the pseudo-Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hunan Soviet government to Tawa in the northern part of Yongshun, and the main force was also concentrated there, resisting the Hunan and Hubei armies on one side and attempting to flee west into Sichuan on the other. The National Army has established a four-pronged encirclement plan. Heavy troops are stationed in western Hubei and eastern Sichuan to block the bandits. The He-Xu troops in Hunan are responsible for pursuing and suppressing the bandits. The Tawa bandit nest was broken by the Guo Rudong division of the Xu's forces on the 8th. The remnants of the bandits were in a state of panic. Yesterday, the Headquarters received a victory telegram from Xu, which stated: "It has been confirmed that the Yu Shen Division of the Third Column of my unit captured the bandit positions on the north and south highlands of Huangshijie. Subsequently, on the same day, they continued to attack the Tawa bandit nest. According to reports from Guo Rudong and Luo Qijiang, the commander and deputy commander of the team, respectively, Luo Qijiang's Independent 34th Brigade of our vanguard arrived at Lengshui Village at noon, due to rain and slippery roads. About a thousand bandits were stationed on the road to Tawa, east of Tawa, and on the mountains inside. Also, about two thousand bandits who had fled from Yongshun this morning were stationed there. Brigade Commander Luo led two regiments to launch a fierce attack on the bandits in Changxi. The bandits resisted fiercely, and after climbing the mountains and fighting hard, they were finally defeated at 4 PM and fled towards Tawa. Our army took advantage of the situation to pursue them towards Tawa, and sent another battalion to pursue the bandits who fled towards Sanjiatian, inflicting heavy blows. The bandit forces weakened, and fled towards Shaba in a panic. As it was getting dark and the situation of the bandits in front was not clear, the brigade maintained contact with the bandits at the Tawa Pass, only three li from Tawa, throughout the night. On the morning of the same day, they attacked the north side of Tawa. Unexpectedly, about two thousand bandits who had fled from Cheping Zuoyan Slope, about fifteen li from Tawa, launched a fierce attack on the line of our Luo Brigade in the morning. After the brigade fought hard, charging back and forth fiercely, the bandits still stubbornly resisted. Commander Guo urgently ordered the 76th Brigade of the 26th Division to rush to the rescue and cooperate in the attack. After another fierce battle until noon, the bandits were finally defeated. The two brigades immediately followed up and advanced, completely occupying Tawa at 1 PM. The bandits fled towards Longjiazhai. In this battle, the Luo Brigade killed more than 500 bandits, captured more than 100 rifles, captured more than 80 bandit soldiers from the fake 538th and 54th Regiments alive, captured the fake Minister of Food, and seized countless bandit flags and printed matter, rescued more than 100 hostages, and gave each hostage five jiao and five sheng of rice to help them return home. The brigade suffered more than 20 officer and soldier casualties. The 76th Brigade of the 26th Division also killed hundreds of bandits and captured more than ten rifles. Overall, this battle was a testament to the bravery and agility of the officers and soldiers. Brigade Commander Luo Qijiang personally supervised the battle, commanding effectively. The rapid support of Brigade Commander Zhu Zaitang of the 26th Division was commendable." (12th)</p>

<p>Beiping Dispatch: This morning (10th) at 10:00 AM, the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Command held a narcotics burning ceremony in front of the Temple of Heaven. A high tower and straw shed was erected in front of the temple, surrounded by soldiers.

Yao Zhenyi, Adjutant of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Command, Xiao Zhengqing, Chief of the Logistics Department, and Teng Shaozhou, Chief of the Secretariat Section, led over 20 adjutants and guards in two large trucks, carrying narcotics to the site. Approximately 700 to 800 people gathered to watch. After the participants gathered, Teng Shaozhou, Section Chief of the department, reported on the significance and process of burning narcotics, briefly stating that today, the headquarters, by order of the Military Sub-Committee, will burn the narcotics related to serious narcotics cases. He briefly reported the details of the process to everyone: On July 13, 23rd year, the headquarters received an order from Chairman Chiang, together with the Gendarmerie Command, the Public Security Bureau, the governments of the Dawan and Daxing Counties, the Ping-Sui, Ping-Han, and Bei-Ning Railways, and the joint military-police office, to conduct the search and arrest of serious narcotics addicts. In total, there were 84 cases and 146 narcotics criminals. Except for 12 people who were approved by the Military Sub-Committee for execution, 40 were sentenced to imprisonment, and 74 were sent to serious narcotics rehabilitation centers, the remaining 5 cases and 11 criminals have been transferred to the Public Security Bureau on December 2, in accordance with Chairman Chiang's telegram order. After that, narcotics cases will be handled independently by the city and county. However, the narcotics confiscated during the period handled by the headquarters from July 13 to December 2 were also considerable. For the sake of closure, the Military Sub-Committee was approved to conduct the burning ceremony in front of the Temple of Heaven this morning. After the report, the burning began in public, including four large bags of lactose, one willow bundle of opium, and one large cabinet of white powder. On the spot, Yao Zhenyi, Adjutant of the Garrison Command, used a knife to cut open the entire package of opium to ensure credibility. The burning was completed at 11:00 AM. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Ministry of Industry Releases Mining Report on Actively Rescuing National Coal and Unifying the Mining and Management Rights of Gold Mines <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The Ministry of Industry is actively carrying out the rescue of national coal and the reorganization of the mining industry. The Mining Department of the Ministry released a written report yesterday on the progress. The following is a record of it:</p>
<p>Rescuing National Coal: The Ministry continues to promote the rescue of national coal in accordance with past policies. All measures beneficial to coal operators are taken. Issues such as streamlining transportation, reducing transportation costs, and exempting additional taxes have been successively consulted with the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Finance, and the political organs of various provinces, and considerable results have been achieved. However, since the equipment of coal mines in various provinces is mostly incomplete and costs vary, to make up for deficiencies, it is necessary to understand the actual situation. The Ministry has dispatched mining investigators Zhang Baoshi, specialist Chen Wei, and members of the National Coal Relief Committee Zhang Hu et al. to investigate the coal mines along the Ping-Han and Ping-Sui railways, to comprehensively investigate the internal organization, engineering equipment, transportation status, and recent business conditions of each mine, in order to comprehensively plan and prevent loopholes, so that domestic coal can be fully developed. The investigation lasted for five months, and the areas covered include: the Liuhegou, Yili, Zhonghe, Lincheng, Sanfeng, Jizhong, Xingbao, and Xiezhong mines along the Ping-Han Railway; the Datong, Baojin, Jinbei, Tongbao, Baoheng, Baoxing, Tianxing, Houfeng, Zhaizhang, Mentougou, and Zhongying mines along the Ping-Sui Railway; the Zhongfu Company on the Daoqing Railway; and the Jingxing, Zhengfeng, Yangquan, Baojin, Pingji, Jianchang, and Guangmao mines on the Zhengtai Railway; The Minsheng and Qiugou Mines on the Longhai Railway. In total, there are 26 mines above, and a list comparing the overview, coal quality analysis, and production, transportation, and sales conditions of each mine has been compiled. In addition, a report on the quantity of coal sold in major ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou has been compiled separately and submitted to the Ministry for review. As for how the mines should unite and how the costs should be reduced, a fundamental solution can be found after the National Coal Relief Committee prepares a plan and submits it for review.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Gold Mines: (1) The Ministry, according to reports, discovered a gold mine in the Yangtigou area in the south of Daixian, northern Shanxi, which covers a large area. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Construction has established a gold mine management office and drafted 19 provisional measures for the area. It has issued a special order to the Department of Construction to investigate and ascertain whether the gold mine discovered in the Yangtigou area is abundant in reserves, what the structure of the ore bed is, and what the mineral composition is, and report it to the Ministry accordingly. It has also ordered the Department to submit the specific development plan that it has drafted for review. (2) The Ministry, according to reports, heard that the Shandong Provincial Government plans to establish a gold mining bureau to mine the gold mines in Yishui, Zhaoyuan, Pingdu, and other counties. It immediately drafted an order to inform the Department that if it is indeed considering this plan, it should submit the plan, its scope, and detailed information for review, in order to unify mining administration and bring it within the scope of the law.</p>
<p>Restricting Small Mines: The Ministry believes that small mines in various provinces have the greatest impact on the rights of large mines. If they are allowed to continue to be divided and registered without any restrictions, it is feared that the entire coalfield will be excavated and fragmented. Those who apply for mining rights legally in the future will not be able to start work, and it will be more difficult to remedy the development in the future, causing harm to mining interests. Moreover, according to the Mining Association, it has requested the strict formulation of measures to ban small mines, so that progress can be made and safety can be ensured. The Ministry is currently studying how to carefully draft these banning measures. The regulations should be based on the premise of not violating the Mining Law and not hindering large mines, while also taking into account the customs of the indigenous peoples of various provinces, so that the proposed measures can be easily implemented. In accordance with the provisions of Article 59 of the Mining Law, only those small mines in places with inconvenient transportation, or with very small reserves, or in areas where mining is underdeveloped, can be approved. No people are allowed to establish small mining rights within the large coal mines that have been established in various provinces, such as Zhongyu, Liuhegou, Cixian, Lincheng, Jingxing Jiawang, Huaiyuan, Pohe, Zhongyuan, and the Kailuan and Luda mines.</p>

<p>Investigating Iron and Manganese: The Ministry believes that there are many iron and manganese resources in our country. After dispatching personnel to investigate, it has been calculated that (1) the Chaling iron mine has an estimated reserve of 3 to 4 million tons; (2) the iron ore in Hengshi area of Xixiang County, Ningxiang County (with an iron content of more than 50%) has about 8 million tons of high-grade ore, and there are also several million tons of inferior ore; (3) geological maps have been drawn for the manganese mine in Leping, Jiangxi and the Yongxin iron mine; (4) geological and mineral resources in Yunnan have been investigated by dispatched personnel and are still ongoing; (5) the coal mine in Mengxian Yezhenzhen, western Henan contains oil. The Henan Geological Survey Institute has dispatched personnel to investigate and has obtained results. The Henan Provincial Department of Construction has been ordered to forward the investigation report, the original coal, and the crude oil samples from the test results to the Ministry for reference.

<h3 id="e93">Zhe Qu County: Coal Mine Discovered in Guoxi Mountain <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Quzhou Dispatch: In Guoxi Mountain, Yuchun Village, in the western part of the county, sand veins run crisscross, with many layers of large rocks. The area is rich in coal deposits. Unfortunately, the villagers have not paid attention to exploration and mining, preventing the development of this resource. Recently, a farmer named Mao Rongbang from the village, due to a difficult livelihood, independently reclaimed mountain land there for planting miscellaneous grains to increase production. Not long after the start of his work, he suddenly discovered piles of coal in the depths of the mountain land. Upon further excavation, even more inexhaustible mineral resources were revealed. Mao was overjoyed and decided to first try mining for a month. After achieving good results, he planned to raise shares and hire workers for full-scale mining. Simultaneously, he submitted a request to the county government to dispatch personnel to conduct an on-site survey. After the county government dispatched an autonomous roving assistant to inspect the mountain, a detailed report on the area of the coal region, the shallow and deep coal seams, has been submitted to the county government for record.

<h3 id="e94">Pseudo-Datong Company Formally Sells Pseudo-National Certificates, Directly Under the Pseudo-Ministry of Civil Affairs, Tianjin Has an Office, Capital is 500,000 Yuan <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The pseudo-organization restricted the passage of our citizens out of the pass, effective April 1st. The pseudo-Ministry of Civil Affairs has newly promulgated fourteen regulations, stipulating that anyone leaving the pass must purchase a pseudo-entry certificate. The Datong Company, responsible for selling these pseudo-entry certificates, was originally an agency temporarily established by the Japanese to provide relief to drifters. Now, it has been formally reorganized as an agency directly under the Police Department of the pseudo-Ministry of Civil Affairs. The company has offices in Shanhaiguan, Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Malanyu, Panjiakou, and Yiyuan, all assisted by resident Japanese military police and pseudo-border police. Initially, each pseudo-entry certificate was sold for two pseudo-yuan. From April 2nd, the price was reduced to five jiao. Recently, despite the strict restrictions, the number of people leaving the pass has not decreased. Therefore, the price has been suddenly increased to two yuan per certificate, and office hours are set from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. As a result, whether traveling by train or not, those leaving the pass face delays and must stay in Yuguan for one or two days before they can purchase a pseudo-entry certificate. In Gubeikou and other places, which are not crucial transportation hubs, the company is even more arbitrarily difficult, intending to prevent our citizens from leaving the pass. In Tianjin, the company's office appeared half a month ago, located at No. 36 Naniwa Street, Japanese Concession, on the right bank of the Fourth River. Passengers traveling by boat from the Tianjin pier to areas outside the pass must purchase a pseudo-entry certificate from this company before boarding. Even those traveling by train purchase pseudo-entry certificates in Tianjin in advance to avoid waiting at inns upon arrival in Shanhaiguan. As a result, many people go to purchase the certificates every day. The office hours of the pseudo-office are the same as those in Yuguan. Generally, those purchasing pseudo-certificates arrive very early to wait. When the doors of the pseudo-office open, Japanese concession military police and concession criminal police officers go to maintain order, using rattan whips and wooden sticks to beat the crowd, forcing them to line up and advance in order. After entering the room, they must squat on the ground, not allowed to speak or spit. When approaching the purchase window, a Japanese person interrogates their name, origin, and other details, and they must provide the name of a guarantor within the pass, which is also filled in on the certificate. Therefore, due to the cumbersome procedures, very few people can purchase the certificate on the same day. If someone privately bribes the military police or criminal police officers with a few yuan, they can be placed at the front of the line to purchase first. However, the Japanese interrogation has no set rules. Sometimes, they ask about family history for three generations, and those who hesitate slightly are beaten by the military police or criminal police, even to the point of breaking whips and sticks. Because those who go to purchase the pseudo-entry certificates are mostly laborers from Hebei and Shandong, determined to go outside the pass, they endure inhumane treatment and adopt an attitude of resignation. In addition to selling pseudo-entry certificates, the Tianjin office of the Datong Company also handles intelligence affairs for the pseudo-national intelligence agency. The intelligence officer is a Japanese named Aoki Daisaku, assisted by Tomita Kimura, Mino Ota, Nitta Ryo, and Sakano Yoichiro. It also employs more than thirty Chinese traitors who work secretly in the Pingjin-Ji-Lu area, responsible for various intelligence gathering tasks. All matters related to contact between the pseudo-nation and the Chinese traitors in the Pingjin area are handled by the pseudo-intelligence agency. Therefore, the organization of the Tianjin office of the pseudo-Datong Company is not simple and deserves attention. (7th)</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: In order to implement regulations to control laborers "outside the country," the Japanese and puppets have reorganized the Datong Company into a Japanese-puppet joint venture company with a capital of 500,000 Japanese yen. Its business involves handling the "identity certificates" of laborers outside the country and engaging in "recruitment, supply, transportation, protection, and relief" of laborers, as well as other matters. The new president is Japanese Igarashi Fusakichi, and the general manager is Mino Tomoyoshi. After the reorganization and inauguration, the company is actively expanding its business. Currently, in addition to branches in Changchun Seitoku and the Japanese Concession of Tianjin, it has branch offices in Tianjin, Shanhaiguan, Xifengkou, Gubeikou, Tanggu, Qingdao Zhifu, Longkou, Weihaiwei, Shenyang, Changchun, Andong, and Yingkou.

<h3 id="e103">Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province: Recent News on the Handling of Land Reporting <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In this province, the land tax of various counties has traditionally been managed by general clerks and runners, resulting in deep-seated malpractices. Tax revenues have been consistently deficient. The provincial authorities, recognizing this, have decided to implement land reporting in batches to rectify the situation at its source. The first batch, including Zhenjiang, Liyang, Yixing, and Jiangyin counties, has already been completed, and a reformed collection system has been implemented. Banks now collect taxes, completely eliminating the past practice of clerks overcharging and embezzling. This has proven quite effective. The second batch includes over ten counties such as Jiangdu, Jintan, and Taicang. The land reporting in Jiangdu County has already been completed. The county government is currently reviewing and organizing the registers for each township, ensuring that each plot is clearly defined with distinct boundaries, and that the names and addresses of the landowners are accurate. This ensures that taxes can be accurately levied on a per-plot, per-household basis, eliminating the previous chaotic and complicated system. According to the reported results, although there are no precise acreage statistics available yet, based on the approximate figures reported by each district, the total arable land in the county is estimated to be over two million mu, exceeding the original registered farmland by over one hundred thousand mu. Jintan County has already completed the land number mapping and the register of taxpaying households, and the reporting process, which began some time ago, will soon be completed. Muyang, Suyu, and Pei counties have also begun reporting. Other counties, such as Yangzhou, Taicang, Jiangning, and Yancheng, are actively preparing and compiling information, and it is expected that they will all be completed by the end of June this year.</p>

<p>Native cloth in the Tongzhou region of northern Jiangsu is a crucial secondary occupation for farming families. Recently, the industry has been in decline, with sales plummeting, leading to the closure of weaving households in the villages. Local leaders are striving to revitalize the industry. In addition to hiring experts to improve the looms and establishing dyeing factories to produce higher quality products, they are also constructing a native cloth market to facilitate the inspection and elimination of inferior cloth, thereby safeguarding the reputation of Tongzhou cloth.</p>

<p>In the areas of Quanzi Li, Mashe, and Zhouwu in southern Xiaoshan, small hills undulate, making the area a prime tea-producing region. This spring, due to the erratic weather, the tea buds sprouted later than usual.

However, the new tea market is not yet thriving, and the amount purchased by each merchant is limited. The price is 1.25 yuan per catty for Qiqiang tea, 0.93 yuan for Benshan tea, and 0.26 yuan for Qingcao tea.</p>

<p>Recently, the erratic weather has greatly affected the silkworm industry in Dongxiang. The early batches of silkworms, having already passed their first molt, have largely stopped feeding due to the unusually cold weather. Furthermore, frequent rainfall has caused the silkworms to consume wet leaves, leading the silkworms in their second molt to secrete yellow fluid and even die of flaccidity. Except for the silkworm farmers in the Xiaosibu and Nanyang areas, who mostly raise improved breeds this year and have not been significantly affected, the silkworms in the remaining four townships are of mixed breeds and have therefore been greatly affected by the cold. Many of the silkworms have become diseased, resulting in a significant reduction in the harvest.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The United States Continues to Raise Silver Prices: Our Side Plans to Avoid Impact; Discussion with the American Economic Mission to Shanghai; Song Ziwen Visits Kong Xiangxi in the Evening to Discuss <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Chinese government and various sectors of the financial community are paying close attention to the United States' increase in silver prices and are planning measures to mitigate the impact. It has been decided to exchange opinions with the American Economic Mission upon its arrival in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>China Attaches Importance to the US Raising Silver Prices</p>
<p>China was previously affected by the US government's nationalization of silver, which led to a massive outflow of silver from the country, causing panic over a shortage of currency and severely impacting industry and commerce. Fortunately, the Ministry of Finance cracked down on smuggling and established the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee to stabilize the market. In addition to increasing taxes on silver exports, a balancing tax was levied, and the import of foreign silver was encouraged. As a result, the outflow of silver gradually ceased, and the market gradually stabilized. Not long after, the United States suddenly raised silver prices again, which the Chinese government and people are paying close attention to.</p>
<p>Various Industries Consult on Stabilizing the Market</p>
<p>The financial community and various industries in Shanghai, recognizing that China is a country with a trade deficit, suffered greatly from the US nationalization of silver last year. If the United States raises silver prices again, there may be an outflow of silver. Since this is of great importance to our country, and the injured industry and commerce have not yet recovered, repeated impact may be unbearable. Therefore, leaders in the financial community and various industries have been holding informal meetings for days. In addition to finding ways to stabilize the market themselves, they hope that the government will quickly develop concrete measures to avoid impacting Chinese commerce.</p>
<p>The Government Plans to Avoid the Impact</p>
<p>Regarding the United States' increase in silver prices, the Chinese government telegraphed Shi Zhaoji, the ambassador to the United States, to notify the US government to make every effort to avoid impacting Chinese industry and commerce. At the same time, it is also planning ways to avoid the impact. Song Ziwen, chairman of the Bank of China, visited Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, at Xiai Xian Si Road yesterday. It is reported that they discussed the US silver price increase.</p>
<p>Exchanging Views with the Mission</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial community has decided to exchange views with the American Economic Mission upon its arrival in Shanghai regarding the US silver price increase. They also hope that the mission will pay attention to the impact of the silver price increase on Chinese industry and commerce. If China's silver reserves flow out in large quantities again, industry and commerce will be unsustainable, and the purchasing power of the Chinese people will also be drastically reduced. The Economic Mission has decided to come to Shanghai from Japan on the 19th of this month.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Prices All Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the selling price of telegraphic transfers announced by the Central Bank was: London, one national currency per shilling, seven and a half pence; New York, one hundred national currency per US$39.375; Paris, one hundred national currency per 595 francs; Berlin, one hundred national currency per 97.25 marks. According to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, the telegraphic transfer rate in New York has been US$34 to US$35 per 100 yuan for several months. The posted price the day before yesterday was US$37.625, and yesterday it suddenly rose to more than US$39. The increase of 5% in one day proves the great impact of the United States' increase in silver prices.</p>
<p>The Balancing Tax Rate Does Not Change Much</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee decided at 10:00 AM yesterday, after consultation between members Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, and Zhang Peishen, that the balancing tax rate would be 6.75%, which is not much different from the usual rate. (According to a late-night newspaper, the balancing tax rate rose to 1.1075. It was found that this number is the exchange rate for the British pound, one shilling, ten and three-quarters pence, and has nothing to do with the balancing tax.)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Agricultural Loan Syndicate: Four Directors Return to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Zou Bingwen of Shanghai Bank, Li Zhongchu of Jiaotong Bank, Yang Yinpu of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Wu Xiaoyuan of Jincheng Bank, directors of the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate, left Shanghai on March 20 to investigate the conditions of rural areas and negotiate loan matters. They completed their work and returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 13th). According to a director, the group first went to Jinan, then to Tianjin and Beiping, and then to Dingxian to visit the cooperative and rural education programs run by Yan Yangchu. They then went to Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Weinan, Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanchang, and other places in a total of six provinces, and organized offices in Beiping, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an, which are managed by Jincheng, Jiaotong, and Shanghai Banks. It is also planned to organize offices in Jinan, Hankou, and Nanchang, but this must be discussed by the board of directors before a decision can be made. As for the amount of loans, it must also be determined after a meeting of the board of directors. It is estimated that the total amount of loans for the three offices in Beiping, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an is approximately 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the directors conducted separate negotiations during this trip. As a result of the negotiations, (1) in terms of procedures, the syndicate is completely in a lending position and does not organize cooperatives themselves. The cooperatives are organized by local people introduced by the local cooperative affairs bureaus or local cooperative committees under the guidance of the Central Cotton Improvement Institute, and are responsible for borrowing from the syndicate. (2) The scope of the loan is limited to cotton, wheat, and rice, as they use scientific, economic, and political forces to hope for rural revitalization, while the syndicate is in a helping position, hoping that within three to five years, the country's food and clothing raw materials will be sufficient for self-sufficiency. (3) The syndicate also plans to organize rural warehouses in the loan areas. This plan is still being formulated.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Lawyers' Association Opposes Telephone Price Increase; Letters Sent Separately to the Authorities of the Two Concessions for Review; Second Special District Citizens' Association Investigates Users <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association sent separate letters to the Public Concession Bureau and the French Consulate in Shanghai yesterday to oppose the telephone price increase. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>The commerce in Shanghai has always been known as flourishing. Since January 28, it has been affected by the global economic panic and the bankruptcy of rural areas, leading to a decline in the market. Factories and businesses have closed down one after another. Even those who can barely maintain their operations have to tighten their belts and implement austerity policies. Under this extremely depressed phenomenon, various parties are working hard to seek relief, such as the citizens' rent reduction movement, the silk industry's acceptance of bills, and banks' generous loans, all with the aim of easing business difficulties and revitalizing the market. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company, ignoring the concerns of all users in the city and unaware of the social and economic situation, is recklessly increasing prices by virtue of its authority, causing public anger and opposition. If this is prolonged, it is bound to lead to accidents.</p>
<p>Telephones are a public utility and a tool for communication, which is related to social prosperity and municipal measures. Therefore, whether state-run or commercially operated in various countries, the interest rates are minimal. How can the company focus solely on the amount of its own profits and insist on going its own way? Even if the company claims that its capital is huge, its expenses are vast, and its official interest and dividends are less than one percent, the company's internal organization lacks an overall plan and does not organize from promoting business and saving expenses. Lower prices and more users will result in higher revenue and thicker profits. Now, it is abandoning the root and pursuing the branch, acting perversely. It has been observed that the previous price increase has already led to a decrease in users. Now, it is changing new rules and doubling the price, which will inevitably further reduce users. Directly reducing the number of households will damage the business. If universal use is possible, the local area will benefit from it, and the company will also benefit. Otherwise, the company will end up losing what it wants to gain. This kind of policy is like drinking poison to quench thirst. There is nothing more clumsy than this.</p>
<p>Your Bureau is the administrative organ of the Public Concession. The telephone company's price increase is related to municipal prosperity, commercial development, traffic convenience, and social tranquility. You must be cautious and detailed. The association, as a legitimate organization of all citizens, is obliged to safeguard the rights of citizens and support public utilities, so we dare not remain silent. We hereby present our humble views and request your bureau to promptly stop or extend the review to alleviate business difficulties and maintain public sentiment.</p>
<p>This is to the Public Concession Bureau, Shanghai Lawyers' Association Standing Committee.</p>
<p>(The letter to the French Consul is similar in content.)</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Fifth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Association held an executive committee meeting the day before yesterday to oppose the repeated price increases by the Shanghai Telephone Company. They unanimously expressed their firm opposition and sent staff to investigate the number of users in the district. At the same time, they also sent a letter to the general association requesting that the Second Special District Telephone Users' Association be organized as soon as possible to effectively oppose the price increase. The association's announcement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Announcement:</p>
<p>In the autumn of this economic depression, when the market is so bad and the economy is so panicked, the Shanghai Telephone Company actually ignores everything and wants to raise prices again. Its greed is unparalleled. Our association specially held a meeting and decided to firmly oppose it. In addition to sending letters to various legal groups for consistent negotiation, we will immediately send staff to investigate the number of users in the district in order to collect statistics for a strong resistance. A questionnaire is attached. Please fill it out and submit it to the association as soon as possible without delay.</p>

<h3 id="e118">The French Ship Purchased by China Merchants Bureau Will Sail to China Tomorrow; Completed Repairs in England After Acceptance <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the state-run China Merchants Bureau purchased a French cargo ship with a total tonnage of 5,600 tons. After approval by the Ministry of Communications, the contract has been signed with the French agent in Shanghai. The bureau has sent a foreign shipowner to the Rhine River to accept the ship and sail it to England for repairs. It was received by telegram yesterday that the ship has been repaired and is scheduled to sail from England to Italy on April 15. Since cargo to Italy was obtained in England, after unloading the cargo in Italy, it will solicit cargo to China and sail to China. The estimated date of arrival in Shanghai is about the end of June. In the future, it will decide to run on the Shanghai-Lianyungang line to transport goods connected by the Longhai Railway. As for the original name of the ship, translated as Dafei, it will be changed to a new name starting with the character "Hai" after arriving in Shanghai, but this will be decided by the board of directors. The cost of purchasing the ship is about 130,000 yuan in national currency, and the last installment was paid in full the day after acceptance.</p>

<p>The Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau's South Wharf is located on bureau property and is not within the French Concession. Therefore, incidents occurring at the wharf can only be handed over to the French Concession police by the wharf personnel. French police cannot exercise their functions at the wharf. This concerns the sovereignty of our country. Recently, due to anti-theft measures at various seaports, the bureau has established a White Russian inspection team, a shipping police team, a South Wharf inspection team, and female inspectors to inspect ships before departure. Unexpectedly, after Liu Hongsheng informed the French Concession police to send detectives to the Jinliyuan Wharf to inspect exports, their police power has extended to the South Wharf and interfered with passengers in the Shanghai-Ningbo wheelhouse at the wharf. The staff in the wheelhouse were helpless. Recently, the Jianghai Customs was ordered to inspect passengers carrying cash and contraband at the South Wharf. Seeing French police inspecting passengers, they believed that this was a violation of sovereignty and negotiated, telling them to respect sovereignty and withdraw from the wharf. The French police refused, showing their intention to make further encroachments. Eventually, the original agreement will be betrayed.</p>

<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that according to the regulations of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the China Bank, the stipulated business operations cannot engage in credit lending. Moreover, the China Bank cannot engage in goods pledging. The relevant clauses are as follows: In addition to the provisions of Article 7 of the Central Bank's regulations, Article 12 stipulates that the following matters shall not be undertaken. Item 3 states that accepting goods as collateral for loans is prohibited. Apart from the provisions of Article 11 of the China Bank's regulations, Article 12 stipulates that the following matters and other businesses shall not be operated, including Item 1, which prohibits various types of unsecured lending and guarantees. In addition to the types of business operations stipulated in Article 16 of the Bank of Communications' regulations, Article 17 stipulates that the following items shall not be operated, Item 1 being various types of unsecured lending and guarantees.</p>
<p>Three Banks Ordered to Grant Loans</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency reporter's inquiry at the three banks yesterday, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the China Bank, after receiving an order from the Ministry of Finance, decided to provide relief to industrial and commercial enterprises facing difficulties by the end of April. Any silver firms or money shops wishing to apply for interbank loans can do so following the procedures of last year's final accounting. The Central Bank announces the daily interbank lending rate every day, which has been two cents for several consecutive days. However, although the China Bank and the Bank of Communications are not permitted to grant small-scale credit loans to industrial and commercial enterprises according to regulations, they have decided to maintain the already approved loans, totaling 1.4 million, for the sake of relieving industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>Total Funds Raised by the Association</p>
<p>The Bankers' Association has raised a total of 1.88 million yuan from its member banks for small-scale credit loans to industrial and commercial enterprises, of which 1 million yuan is from the China Bank and 400,000 yuan is from the Bank of Communications. In addition, banks such as the Shanghai-Zhejiang Xingye Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the Kenye Bank, the Guohuo Bank, the Xinhua Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Dalu Bank, the Yanye Bank, and the Zhongnan Bank have contributed a total of 480,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e121">The Bankers' Association Petitions the Ministry of Finance to Increase Import Tariffs on Foreign Cotton: Drastic Decline in Domestic Cotton Prices Necessitates All-Out Protection; Increased Foreign Cotton Tariffs Are Imperative <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bankers' Association, considering the petition from the Cotton Merchants' Association regarding the dumping of foreign cotton and the drastic decline in domestic cotton prices, and recognizing its impact on national finance, submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance on April 12, stating: "Since the implementation of cotton control over the past two years, significant progress has been made in expanding cotton fields and improving cotton varieties. Recently, the influx of foreign cotton has caused domestic cotton prices to plummet drastically, jeopardizing the effectiveness of the control measures and leading to a massive outflow of silver, which could undermine the foundation of the nation. At a time of trade deficits and financial distress, remedies are already insufficient; how can we endure further devastation? Moreover, there is ample cotton stored in rural areas to meet domestic needs. Allowing this dumping to continue will inevitably drive cotton farmers and merchants into dire straits, and the financial industry's operations of cotton mortgages and remittances will inevitably suffer as well. The association's proposal to increase import tariffs on foreign cotton is an urgent matter. Recognizing that cotton is a vital product of our nation's rural areas, the government should provide full protection to stem the tide and safeguard the foundation of the nation. Therefore, we petition your ministry to swiftly implement increased import tariffs on foreign cotton to stabilize the precarious situation and seek your instructions for compliance, which is in the public interest."</p>
<h3 id="e122">National Goods Promotion Association: Officially Opens on a Fixed Date, Constructing the Venue on the 16th, Drawing Lots on the 20th <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Chinese National Products Manufacturers and the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association, previously initiated by the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, had its opening postponed several times due to the lack of approval from the Municipal Party Headquarters. Now, it is learned that the Municipal Party Headquarters has approved the event. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Postponement</p>
<p>According to Liu Zhongying, a standing committee member of the United Association of Chinese National Products Manufacturers, the association originally intended to use the vacant land opposite the Great World as the venue and set the opening date for January 20. However, the owner of the land had traveled far abroad, making it impossible to contact him. They then negotiated with Mr. Kuang Zhongmou, who agreed to allow the use of the vacant land in the Xiaoximen Penglai Market as the venue. The opening was then postponed to March 15, and the matter was reported to the Municipal Party Headquarters for record-keeping. However, just as the association was beginning preparations, another organization, the National Goods Business Publishing House, also applied to the Penglai Market Office to use the same vacant land for a National Goods Exhibition. As both events were scheduled for March 15, and both aimed to promote national goods in the same location, a conflict was inevitable. The Party Headquarters also found it difficult to make a decision due to this conflict, leading to repeated postponements through negotiations and explanations. Finally, after consultations between the association and the National Goods Business Publishing House, it was agreed that the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association would be held first. The association then requested the Municipal Party Headquarters to approve and record the matter, which has now been granted, thus confirming the opening date as the 22nd of this month. It was also mentioned that as of yesterday, more than 100 manufacturers had joined the association, and a grand opening is expected.</p>
<p>Registration Notice</p>
<p>The United Association of Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Notice No. 13 states: This is an urgent notice. The Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association, previously initiated by the association and the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, has been repeatedly postponed due to the lack of approval from the Municipal Party Headquarters. On April 13, the association received Approval No. 2788 from the Municipal Party Headquarters, approving the event. The association's provisional standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon resolved the following: (1) The official opening is set for April 22, and there will be no further postponements. (2) The construction of the venue is set for the 16th, and the drawing of lots to determine location is set for the 20th. (3) All participating manufacturers who have not paid the venue fee must pay it within three days and obtain a receipt for the lottery. (4) Any manufacturers who have not registered but wish to participate must bring the venue fee (35 yuan per booth, including advertising costs) and send staff to the association for registration before the 20th. Accordingly, this notice is recorded and announced. Please do not hesitate any longer to avoid missing the opportunity.

<p>The Industry News Agency reports that six refugees from the 46th batch expelled from Japan, Liao Kexiang, Yu Dami, Zhu Yancou (from Wenzhou), Wu Zigui, Ying Wuxian, and Gu Linggui (from Fujian), arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Tsukuba Maru of the Japan Mail Steamship Company from Yokohama and Moji. The ship docked at the Xinhuaishan Wharf in Pudong. According to refugee Liao Kexiang, speaking to an Industry News Agency reporter yesterday, they are penniless and struggling to make a living. They plan to request financial assistance from the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau tomorrow (i.e., today) for travel expenses to go to the Qiaole Village for land reclamation.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Sanbei Company: Labor Dispute on the Shouchang Ship; Yichang Seamen's Branch Forcibly Appoints Half of the Crew; Head Office Firmly Denies and Plans to Dissolve the Crew <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Shouchang ship was forcibly boarded by workers appointed by the local Yichang Seamen's Branch, who expelled the original stewards, causing a labor dispute. The ship has now set sail and is expected to arrive at the port in two or three days. The recent developments in this matter are detailed below:</p>
<p>Sanbei's Reply and Negotiation</p>
<p>Upon learning that the Yichang Seamen's Branch had forcibly appointed workers to board the ship, overtaking the existing stewards and cargo handlers, the Sanbei Company sent a letter to the Yichang Seamen's Branch, stating: "The cargo handlers and crew members of the Shouchang ship were employed from unemployed workers from our company's Dexing and Fuhua ships. How can your branch arbitrarily appoint workers to board the ship? The Shouchang ship's engine department has not yet been fully prepared, and it needs to be docked for repairs upon its return to Shanghai. All crew members will be dismissed. Please withdraw your workers immediately."</p>
<p>Yichang Seamen's Branch's Struggle</p>
<p>After receiving Sanbei's letter, the Yichang Seamen's Branch replied, stating: "Since the Shouchang ship's port of registry is Yichang, the cargo handlers and crew members should be appointed by our branch. We have already made a significant concession by appointing only half of the required workers to the ship, including six cargo handlers and twelve stewards, as the ship needs twelve cargo handlers and twenty-four stewards for the midships section. The workers appointed by our branch have already been informed by the comprador of the ship, Liu Yongzhang. As for the matter of the ship going to the factory for repairs and the dismissal of workers, our branch cannot take that into consideration."</p>
<p>Labor and Wage Disputes</p>
<p>Since the Shouchang ship could not refuse the workers appointed by the Yichang branch to board the ship, it had no choice but to allow them to remain on board and resolve the matter upon arrival in Shanghai. Comprador Liu refused to pay the wages of these eighteen cargo handlers and stewards, as they were not appointed by the head office and had not been recognized by the head office. The Yichang Seamen's Branch has lodged a strong protest, sending a letter to Liu Yongzhang stating that if the wages are not paid, the Yichang Seamen's Branch will not be responsible for any unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Negotiations After the Ship Arrives</p>
<p>Yesterday, when a reporter inquired with the Sanbei Company about how they would resolve the labor dispute on the Shouchang ship, a responsible person stated that the Shouchang ship would arrive soon. The company had already appointed thirty-six crew members for the ship and would not allow others to interfere in personnel administration. They will summon the workers for guidance when the ship arrives in Shanghai. If they do not listen, they will have no choice but to dismiss them for the purpose of repairs and docking.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Sixth Day of the Arts Exhibition Preview: Preferential Measures for School Groups to Visit <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday was the sixth day of the Shanghai preview of the London Chinese Arts Exhibition. It was also a Saturday with fine weather, and the number of schools, organizations, and groups from Shanghai visiting the exhibition was extremely crowded. The exhibition's reception staff were very busy. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people will visit the exhibition during its opening period. The exhibition has established reception rules and distributed them to all reception staff to ensure that all visitors are satisfied. The situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Groups</p>
<p>Recently, there have been numerous requests from schools and organizations to visit the exhibition.

It is expected that the number of visitors will break the record of the past few days.</p>
<p>Value of Antiques</p>
<p>Yesterday, a well-known antique dealer visited the exhibition. According to his assessment of the bronzes and porcelain, each piece is worth at least 20,000 yuan. Some bronzes are even valued at 500,000 yuan overseas, and some rare porcelains are valued at up to 1 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Free Extension of Transportation of Relief Goods: Until the End of April This Year <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The free transportation of relief goods by railway was originally scheduled to end at the end of March, and it would be canceled upon expiration. However, the Famine Relief Association of various provinces, in view of the severe spring famine in various disaster-stricken provinces and the large number of starving people, is continuing to organize spring relief and is transporting a large number of relief goods. The association requested an extension of three months to facilitate relief efforts. The Ministry of Railways has approved an extension of one month until the end of April this year. The ministry has ordered the two railway bureaus to take note of this.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance Requesting Exemption of Transit Tax on Rough Tea <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 12th of this month, the Municipal Association of Coarse Tea Industry stated in a letter that silk and tea have always been major export commodities of our country. Since the successive development of overseas raw silk and artificial silk, the sales of Chinese silk in the international market have become increasingly narrow. The authorities have been making every effort to maintain and relieve the industry, from issuing public bonds to controlling production. Although the future of the silk industry is unknown, silk farmers and merchants have already benefited greatly. The decline of Chinese tea is no different from the situation of silk. Japan and India are emerging tea-producing countries, and the European market has been completely seized. This is the first reason why the overseas tea industry must be relieved. In recent years, the tea-producing areas in the hinterland have only been relatively peaceful in eastern Zhejiang. In the suburbs of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, they have been repeatedly ravaged by communist bandits. The collapse of the countryside is unbearable to recall. Merchants who process tea locally must either carry their own rations or find it difficult to get a full meal. This is the second reason why the conditions in the producing areas must be relieved. Tea farmers are sick, and tea merchants are no less sick. Since the September 18th Incident, the North China tea market has been affected by military events. Outstanding accounts are uncollectible, and advances are unrecoverable. The transport of green tea to the north has plummeted. Tea merchants everywhere take Shanghai as the general hub, but since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's financial situation has suddenly shown signs of collapse, making it difficult for merchants to extend credit and making them afraid to handle goods. After exhaustion, they have all become deadlocked. This is the third reason why the suffering of tea merchants must be relieved. The state's encouragement of Chinese tea has not been slightly biased. Even looking at the new tariff rules promulgated in 1931, the tea industry, in addition to being exempt from export taxes, the transit tax on black tea bricks is still temporarily exempt as before. At that time, because tea merchants did not participate in the discussion, other types of tea leaves did not receive equal benefits. From the perspective of tariff rules, raw black tea, when reported and transported at the first port, is entitled to tax exemption if it has been baked. However, raw black tea that arrives in Shanghai and must also be baked is still required to pay transit tax. The tea tax on raw tea is also the same at other ports. The taxation itself is already unfair. Moreover, the taxed tea is mostly raw tea, that is, coarse tea. The taxation of raw tea has the greatest impact on tea farmers in the producing areas and tea merchants who transport it. In this depleted situation, they are really unable to bear this burden. Try to investigate the conditions of the producing areas and the market situation, and you will naturally see that it is impossible not to provide relief. The only way to provide relief is to request the Ministry of Finance to exempt this transit tax in advance and first relieve the suffering that cannot be delayed, and then discuss other matters. It is also found that due to the transit taxation of raw tea, the reporting procedures are extremely cumbersome. Merchants who handle imports and exports must go through customs three times. During this time, there are opportunities for corruption and acceptance of tips and illegal fees. The amount of tax collected by the state is insignificant, while tea farmers and tea merchants are always sighing about how they come later. The new tea of this year is about to arrive in Shanghai in large quantities. For this reason, we earnestly describe the suffering of the tea industry and ask you to forward it to the Ministry of Finance, taking into account the difficulties of merchants and quickly deciding on a plan." The Chamber of Commerce, after investigating the national encouragement of tea and its sales abroad, not only exempts export taxes when exported from Shanghai, but also exempts transit taxes when transferred from the first port of origin to Shanghai, all in order to reduce costs and facilitate export. This is evident in the case of transit black tea bricks, which are exempt from transit tax. However, this transit tax exemption is limited to brick tea and baked black tea. If raw tea is transported to Shanghai, then baked and exported, it is still necessary to pay the transit tax. The treatment of the same export black tea is different. It is neither sufficient to show public universality, nor are the tea leaves that are transported to Shanghai and then sold abroad only black tea and brick tea. Therefore, the scope of the transit tax exemption set at that time was not able to take everything into consideration. According to the previous letter, it is appropriate to cable to your ministry for review and approval, and to allow the transit raw tea to be exempted from transit tax in the same way as black tea brick tea, which is in the public interest.

In other news, it is reported that the office yesterday continued to appoint Zhao Shen and Luo Tong as the captains of the solicitation teams 417 and 418 in the two Shanghai areas, and it is reported that appointment letters and various solicitation documents have been sent.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Watch and Clock Trade Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at its clubhouse on Nanjing Road to discuss the issue of soliciting donations for the national aviation cause. Committee members Dong Zixing, Bao Bokuan, Tian Zhaolin, Zhou Linxiang, Hu Qiaqin, Li Weizhai, Ren Kangbo, He Juxing, and more than ten others attended the meeting. Zhang Yuliang, sent by the office of the general captain of the Aviation Association, attended to provide guidance. Chairman Dong Ziyu reported the significance of the meeting and immediately resolved to appoint all executive committee members as deputy captains. The fundraising method will be discussed and decided at another subcommittee meeting.</p>

<p>According to Secretary Li of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the factory survey is a preliminary plan for implementing factory inspections. Since the beginning, the first phase has been fully completed, and the second phase of work has now begun, starting with surveys of the capital equipment, worker management, and other aspects of factories in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and other areas, in order to ensure complete equipment and safety. However, all industries in our country are currently worse than those in other countries, so the bureau's factory survey focuses on factual issues. Regarding the inspection of factories in the concessions, it is reported that we will submit the issue for discussion at the upcoming International Labor Conference. The negotiations between the municipal government and the concession authorities on this matter have been repeated, but there is still no result. According to Secretary-General Yu of the municipal government, speaking to a reporter, the issue of factory inspections in the Public Concession is still stalled.</p>
<h3 id="e132">China Foreign Famine Relief General Association Organizes Xi'an Visiting Group Departing from Shanghai on May 14th <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief General Association's biennial general meeting is scheduled for May 17th and 18th in Xi'an. Branch associations and offices from various provinces will send Chinese and foreign representatives to attend, report on relief and disaster prevention work in various locations, discuss future work plans, and conduct on-site inspections of Xi'an's recent situation on the 19th and 20th. The association's Shanghai office, recognizing the substantial interest in Xi'an among Shanghai residents, is taking this opportunity to organize a Xi'an visiting group. This will allow interested parties from all walks of life to conveniently visit and inspect Xi'an's economic situation and the association's various disaster prevention projects in Xi'an. In recent years, the Chinese people have recognized the importance of the Northwest region, and all are eager to see it for themselves. Now that there is this good opportunity, don't miss it. The visiting group is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on May 14th by special express train and return to Shanghai on the 22nd. The cost of round-trip second-class travel is 115 yuan per person, and third-class travel is 60 yuan per person, excluding food and accommodation expenses.

<h3 id="e133">Shanghai: Merger of Various White Russian Organizations <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>On Monday evening (the 8th) of this week, approximately 60 representatives from various parties gathered at the new premises of the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Association, No. 118 Muir Road, Shanghai, for an unusually important meeting. The matter discussed at the meeting was the merger of various Shanghai White Russian organizations into one. The reason is that Shanghai White Russians are not recognized by Red Russia and are therefore stateless. Consequently, they have no government or consular representatives to protect their interests, and their opinions are also not aligned, leading to the division into several organizations, each vying to be representative. The result is that resident White Russians in Shanghai lack a formal organization to protect their interests, and outsiders suspect that these competing organizations are of no benefit to the White Russians and cannot represent them. In fact, they are detrimental rather than beneficial. Enlightened individuals among the White Russian community deeply felt the inappropriateness of this situation. They secretly united with each other, sought agreement from all parties, and brought about mutual understanding among the various groups of resident White Russians in Shanghai. As a result, this meeting took place. The most important thing was to enable the various parties of resident White Russians in Shanghai to understand each other and abandon their respective selfish intentions. Therefore, before the meeting began, the Russian Orthodox Bishop Ioanna, stationed in Shanghai, served as temporary chairman and gave a brief speech. Her speech aimed to encourage mutual understanding among the resident White Russians in Shanghai, to abandon all previous differences of opinion, and to unite the White Russians to create a formal representative body to benefit the White Russian community. After she finished her speech, she retired. The person who succeeded the bishop as chairman was Dr. Kazatchkov, director of the Russian Orthodox Hospital. After delivering a few words, he introduced Mr. Fuming to report to the representatives present. The most important point in his report was that the current situation is serious. Observing the situation of all parties, the various organizations and institutions of White Russians in Shanghai must immediately be merged and united into one. After Mr. Fuming finished his speech, all the representatives present expressed their agreement and support, and the following resolutions were passed on the spot: Mr. Metzler will serve as the formal representative of resident White Russians in Shanghai. The Shanghai White Russian Association will be merged. Mr. Fuming was elected as the president of the Overseas Chinese Federation from among 25 representatives. At the same time, Mr. Metzler will be the formal representative of the White Russian community. Any negotiations with the Chinese and foreign governments or the Shanghai Municipal Council will be handled by him, while Mr. Fuming and the Federation will handle all internal matters of the association.</p>

<p>Zhu Dajun (also known as Zhu Xi), a member of the Chinese Corps of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, encountered Zhou Ronghui, a woman from Jinshan, at the China Theater last spring. He used seductive tactics. After a considerable period of pursuit, he achieved his goal. Initially, he used temporary lodgings as a place for intimacy, and then rented a house on Hart Road to live together, seemingly as husband and wife. Until January of this year, Zhu suddenly changed from love to aversion, beat and abused Zhou, and then expelled her. He further hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Zhou, accusing her of fraud and theft, claiming that Zhou was a prostitute who had defrauded and stolen his Corps firearms and a valuable watch. Zhou Ronghui also filed a counterclaim against Zhu, accusing him of inducing her into illicit relations and then abandoning her, and requesting that Zhu be punished for assault, false accusation, and other crimes, after multiple summons and trials by the First Special District Court, Zhu Dajun was ordered to pay 200 yuan in bail. This information has already been detailed in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon was the date of the verdict. Zhu and Zhou both surrendered to the court.

<p>Since the French Concession authorities strictly prohibited streetwalkers from soliciting customers along the streets, the streetwalkers standing on the streets of the Siming Public Cemetery and along Rue Foch were generally forced by madams to go to the Chinese areas to secretly engage in prostitution. Recently, they have openly solicited customers on Rue Foch. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued orders to the relevant police stations to strictly crack down on them. Although arrests have been made and punishments imposed, they still do not restrain themselves. Bureau Chief Cai Jinjun believes that this is a disgrace to the city appearance and has recently ordered a strict crackdown. From 9 PM the night before until last night, Chief Shen Zhenhua of the Old North Gate Police Station specially dispatched Patrol Captain Gao Kui to lead all the police officers, disguised, on Rue Foch, from the New North Gate to the area around the Little North Gate, successively arresting 19 streetwalkers soliciting customers for prostitution along the way, including Yu Fengxian, Gu Lu's, Chen Yang's, Chen Wang's, Zhao Ye's, Wang Zhou's, Wan Fang's, Tao Jihong, Tao Wu's, Cai Dabao, Cai Zheng's, Shen Yang's, Zhou Zhang's, Zhou's, Zhang Fubao, Ren Zhang's, etc. Upon interrogation at the police station, the defendants dared to openly solicit customers for prostitution along the way, which was extremely illegal. They were sentenced and transferred to the General Bureau for further interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Zhongnan Bank Doorman Arrested for Shooting and Killing Chauffeur: Parked in Bank's Private Road and Refused to Leave; Doorman Became Angry and Opened Fire <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 11:50 AM yesterday, in front of the Zhongnan Bank at No. 110 Hankou Road, an incident occurred in which the bank's doorman shot and killed a chauffeur. Tang Boyuan, secretary of the Bankers' Association, had important business yesterday around 11:40 AM and needed to contact various banks. He instructed his chauffeur, Mao Miaosheng, to drive his private car (Concession Permit No. 3658) from the association to the Zhongnan Bank. After arriving in front of the Zhongnan Bank, he instructed the chauffeur to stop the car and disembarked. The chauffeur, seeing that his employer had gotten out of the car in front of the bank, parked the car in the row of cars on the Zhongnan Bank's private road to wait. Unexpectedly, he was seen by Liu Liangmei (age 42, from Jiangxi), the bank's doorman, No. 549, who stated that except for the private vehicles of bank employees, all other vehicles were prohibited from parking on the private road. Seeing that the car was not an employee's vehicle, he immediately intervened and ordered it to be driven away immediately. The chauffeur, Mao Miaosheng, immediately explained the employer's identity and business to Liu, stating that he would leave soon, so there was no need to make things difficult. However, Liu refused. Mao, thinking that he was unreasonable, locked the car door and went elsewhere. Upon seeing this, Liu became extremely angry and immediately went forward to grab Mao, insisting that he drive the car away. While they were arguing, Yao Guisheng, the chauffeur hired by Gao Shangyou, the owner of a private car with Concession Permit No. 3836, who was next to them, learned of the situation and stepped forward to mediate. Unexpectedly, Liu scolded Yao Guisheng severely. As a result, Mao Miaosheng and Yao Guisheng ignored Liu and walked away together. Unexpectedly, Liu still did not let go and chased after Mao and grabbed them again, stating that if they did not drive away, he would have the car taken to the police station. At this time, Mao and the others also started using abusive language, mocking Liu that if he wanted to take it to the police station, he could drive it himself. "Even if we are beaten to death today, we will not drive the car away," they said. This incited Liu's barbarity, and he did not consider the consequences. He immediately drew the pistol he was carrying on his waist and fired two shots. Mao Miaosheng was quick-witted, saw Liu draw his gun, and knew things were not good. He quickly dodged and avoided being hit. However, Yao Guisheng was unable to dodge and was shot in the waist. He fell to the ground on the spot. There was an uproar among the bystanders, and they immediately reported to the patrolling police, who arrested Liu and telegraphed the Central Police Station to send a car to take Yao Guisheng to Renji Hospital for treatment. Despite the hospital's best efforts, he eventually died at 8:30 PM last night due to the injury being in a vital area and excessive bleeding. The hospital notified the police to transfer the body to the coroner's office for examination. The perpetrator, Liu Liangmei, will be sent to court tomorrow morning for investigation.</p>

<p>A young traveler, leading a country woman, checked into Room 1128 of the Dazhong Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao in the French Concession the day before yesterday. After paying the room fee, he signed the register as Zhou Guangdian, from Changzhou, currently an apprentice at a pawnshop. The woman's name was Zhou Qiaozhen, 15 years old, dressed like a country girl. They were siblings. After entering the room, they closed the door tightly and there was no movement at first. Unexpectedly, around 5 AM the next morning, the tea boy on duty suddenly heard moaning sounds from the room. He pushed open the door and entered, only to see the man and woman lying face up on the bed, their faces pale. Knowing that they had taken poison, he felt them. The male guest's limbs were cold, and he had died. However, the woman's eyes were fixed and her mouth was agape, and she was still alive. He quickly reported to the Grande Route Station Police Station, and the head of the detectives sent detectives to investigate and sent her to Renji Hospital. Zhou Qiaozhen had taken a lighter dose of poison, and after examination by the doctor, she gradually recovered. Afterwards, when questioned, Qiaozhen, being a country girl, stared blankly and did not respond. It was heard that Zhou and her brother-in-law both worked at a pawnshop. Usually, her brother-in-law was very strict with her, and if she made a mistake, he would scold her loudly, even resorting to physical violence. Zhou, unable to bear the abuse, suddenly had thoughts of death. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday (the 12th), he took his sister to the inn and secretly took opium to commit suicide. At first, his sister Qiaozhen was unwilling to die. After Guangdian coaxed her repeatedly, she took a small amount of opium juice. As for Zhou's body, it was transported by the hospital to the Tongren Fuyuantang to await examination by the court. In his pocket, 85 yuan in cash was found, which was handed over to his sister to collect.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Truth About the Famous Prostitute Hongfu's Coma in the Hotel: "Chloroform" is Extremely Potent and Can Harm People; Despicable Youngsters Engage in Illegal Activities on the Shanghai Bund—Evil Thoughts Arose from Watching a Captivating Scene in a Movie— <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The famous prostitute Hongfu Lao Jiu of Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road, was recently lured to the Yangtze Hotel by bandits under false pretenses and drugged, losing her mind and robbed of her precious jewelry. Afterwards, the prostitute reported to the police station, requesting an investigation. It has been briefly reported in the newspaper. Now it is known that the bandits in this case have been arrested by Detective Ruan Taibin of the Yulin Road Police Station: Ruan Zilin, Lu Jianying, Li Jianguang, etc. Ruan is 22 years old, Li is 23 years old, both from Ningbo. Lu is only 21 years old, originally from Hangzhou. These three men are vagrants on the Shanghai Bund and have no regular jobs. This time, Ruan Zilin took the initiative in drugging and robbing valuables. At first, Ruan was not familiar with this kind of trick. Recently, he happened to go to the Grand Shanghai Theater to watch a movie. There was a scene in the movie where someone was drugged with medicine. After watching it, he became obsessed and wanted to imitate it. On the 3rd of this month, he secretly conspired with the two bandits Lu and Li to try it out. After Lu and Li agreed to help, he searched for the drug. However, pharmacies never easily sell drugs containing toxic substances. Because Ruan was friends with Liu Jiaji, a doctor who lived at No. 12 Xuetang Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, he went to visit Liu on the 5th and asked for a drug. Liu asked about its purpose and gave him two small bottles of "chloroform," which has the power to make people lose consciousness, and instructed him on how to use it. He only needed to drop one or two drops on a handkerchief and cover the mouth and nose of the person being drugged. The person would inhale the medicinal gas and immediately fall into a coma. If too many drops were used, the medicine would be very strong, the handkerchief would burn, and it would hurt people. Ruan was taught carefully. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, he first pawned a coat for 10 yuan. Then, he invited the two bandits Lu and Li to go to the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road and rent Room 523, falsely claiming the name Ding Zhenyu, and paid the room fee of 5 yuan. As for who they wanted to drug, they had no purpose at first. Then, the three bandits unanimously agreed that prostitutes were easier to lure and easier to set up. So, they asked the waiter for the telephone book. After checking it, they decided that the prostitutes in Hongfu's brothel must be richly dressed and must have made a lot of money. They called the porter of Hongfu's brothel at No. 31 Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road, using the name Wang. After a while, Hongfu Lao Jiu (with the small name Wang Yuxian, from Jiaxing) came gracefully. However, the prostitute did not know any of the three bandits. She asked who Mr. Wang was. The bandits falsely claimed that Mr. Wang had gone elsewhere to play mahjong and would be back soon. They offered the prostitute cigarettes and tea, but she declined them. The bandits were afraid that the prostitute would not stay long. So, the bandit Ruan secretly went behind the prostitute and, according to Liu Jiaji's instructions, poured a little of the medicine from the bottle on the handkerchief and suddenly covered the prostitute's face with the handkerchief. The prostitute immediately felt a strange smell entering her nose. Knowing that she had encountered a violent guest, she opened her mouth and shouted for help. The bandits were afraid that the plan would fail. So, Lu Jianying used violent means to restrain the prostitute's hands and feet. Ruan Zilin pressed her mouth tightly with the handkerchief. Li Jianguang, thinking that the medicinal power was too light, disregarded the consequences and poured the bottle of medicine on the prostitute's face. The medicine was indeed very strong, immediately causing Hongfu to fall into a coma and injure her jade face. Seeing that the work was done, Lu and Li took the gold bracelets from the prostitute's arm and fled first. Bandit Ruan, feeling the medicinal gas in the room, immediately closed the door to prevent it from leaking out. Then, he left the prostitute on the bed and saw that she was still wearing a jade ring on her finger. He robbed it and fled. Afterwards, he met the two bandits Lu and Li in front of the Grand Bright Cinema and took the tram together to the Baidu Bridge. Bandit Ruan threw the bottle of medicine with very little left into the Huangpu River. The unused bottle was still hidden on his person. He instructed Bandit Lu to take the gold bracelets to Yucheng Pawnshop at No. 236 Tiantong Road and pawn them for 30 yuan and 4 jiao. After redeeming Bandit Ruan's coat, the remaining money was divided among them. Ruan got 7 yuan, Lu got 8 yuan, and Li got 4 yuan and a jade ring. With the remaining 1 yuan and 4 jiao, the three bandits went to the New Central Cinema to buy tickets to watch a movie and spent it all. Then, they parted ways and disappeared. The drugged prostitute, until after the bandits had fled for a long time, slowly woke up, but felt a lot of pain in her face. The people in the brothel were all gone. When she asked the waiter, he had no idea. At that time, the prostitute felt severe pain in her abdomen and blood came out of her mouth. The innkeeper reported to the relevant police station, and the detectives came to investigate and sent the prostitute back. On the 11th, Detective Ruan received a report that Ruan Zilin was in Suzhou at a friend's place. He immediately went there and arrested Ruan, bringing him back to Shanghai. After questioning, it was learned that the two bandits Lu and Li were hiding at No. 62 Xiude Lane, Gaoyue Road, Zhabei. Yesterday, he joined the police station and arrested them. The stolen goods such as bracelets and rings were also recovered. Yesterday morning, the police station first escorted Bandit Ruan to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case, saying that the two bandits Lu and Li were still detained in the Public Security Bureau and requested a written request to pick them up. Judge Jiang briefly questioned Bandit Ruan and the victim and ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled for another hearing.</p>

He employs Zhang Caifu (28 years old) from Yangzhou and Chang Houde (41 years old) from Anhui to help with the work. At around 3 AM the day before yesterday, the two employees woke up. They were bored in the pavilion and played dominoes to pass the time while waiting for dawn. After an hour, Chang lost six copper coins. Zhang felt tired and wanted to sleep a little longer, but Chang refused. They argued with each other. Chang angrily used his leather shoe to beat Zhang in the face. Zhang was strong and took the shoe and retaliated by hitting Chang on the head and right eye. They dragged each other downstairs, went out the door, and argued. The nearby patrolling police heard the alarm and arrived, taking the two men to the Yulin Road Police Station. After reporting to the head of the police, they were told that the two were colleagues and had suffered only minor injuries. Chang also stated that he did not want to file a lawsuit. They were both released and returned to the shop. At lunchtime, Chang bought wine and ate it with beef, then went to bed to relieve his troubles. Zhang also apologized to him. Unexpectedly, around 8 AM, the shop owner's wife went to check on him and found his face pale and on the verge of death. She was very alarmed. Her husband Dazhang had returned to his hometown for business. So, she told her brother Yang Daxing to report to the police and call an ambulance to take Chang to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. He died soon after.

<p>The Special Party Department of Chinese Seafarers, recognizing that the majority of seafarers in various regions under its jurisdiction are illiterate, and that even minor tasks requiring writing must be entrusted to others, causing them great distress. To remedy this situation, solve the difficulties faced by seafarers, increase their interest in literacy, and complete the basic work of the literacy movement, the organization section of the department has drafted a method for establishing literacy and writing assistance centers for seafarers. It has requested that subordinate party departments at all levels be universally ordered to establish these centers within the shortest possible time to promote widespread literacy and progress. The methods for the seafarers' writing and literacy assistance centers are as follows: "Methods for Seafarers' Writing and Literacy Assistance Centers": (1) To facilitate seafarers in various regions in commissioning the writing of documents, seeking clarification on difficult words, and assisting in solving difficult problems, this association will establish seafarers' writing and literacy assistance centers in the subordinate district party departments (hereinafter referred to as subordinate party departments). (2) When seafarers encounter the aforementioned difficulties and request assistance, the person in charge of each seafarer's writing and literacy assistance center must use a sincere attitude to first inquire about their name, age, and place of origin, and record them in the register. Then, inquire about the purpose of their visit or the difficult matter, and provide detailed instructions and answers. The questions and answers must be recorded in detail for future reference. (3) Subordinate party departments that have established writing and literacy assistance centers must submit a weekly report to this association, detailing the number of people who have come to inquire, the general meaning of the words being written, and the solutions to the problems.

<h3 id="e146">Shanghai South: Public Buses Add New Routes; Director of Public Works Bureau, Xu, Surveys on Foot <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has found that since the operation of public buses in Shanghai South, business has been very prosperous. However, the traffic there is becoming increasingly busy, so it is still striving to expand. In addition to adding routes in Shanghai South, a long-distance public bus route is also being opened in Pudong. The latest situation obtained from the investigation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Adding Routes: The new routes planned by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities in Shanghai South will be realized soon. However, due to the failure of the newly ordered vehicles to arrive on time, it has to be temporarily delayed. It is expected to be realized in mid-next month. As for the new route set up in Pudong, it was originally scheduled to operate on the 10th, but due to vehicle problems, it will be postponed.</p>
<p>Planning for Safety: The speed of the public buses operating in Shanghai South by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is faster than that of trams. However, the excessive speed is advantageous in terms of business, but it has an impact on safety. According to the accident statistics since the opening, there have been 73 car accidents, 62 injuries, 7 deaths, 82 injuries, and 3 animal injuries. Therefore, for the sake of safety, the bureau will seek other ways to increase business income and maintain the status quo regarding the speed issue.</p>
<p>Recruiting Ticket Sellers: The routes to be expanded by the bureau will be realized soon. For the sake of caution, ticket sellers will be recruited by means of examination. It was originally set at 20 people, but the number of applicants introduced by various parties has reached hundreds. To show fairness, the bureau will handle it according to strict examination procedures, except for a very small number of people who are given special consideration. The list of names is as follows: Pei Wenbao, Wu Baoshu, Zhao Mingyi, Wen Fu, Lu Yurui, Yang Kai, Fei Nianzu, Ye Liangrui, Zhu Peicai, Zhang Liangeng, Liu Hewu, Chai Yu, Liu Xingxu, En Tai, Xin Chengli, Zheng Xiechun, Ma Jinhou, Wang Yin, Shi Jian, Qin Hua, Pan Zhifang, Zhang Shuoxiu, Wan Huanzhang, Zhou Jinggeng, Ling Chunshan, etc., 25 people. There are also Ye Junan, Rui Wenda, and Wu Shengshi, who were specially recruited.</p>
<p>Director Inspects: Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in view of the imminent operation of the new public bus route in Shanghai South, specially went to various places to inspect on foot yesterday. As a result of the inspection, he believes that there are still things that should be paid attention to, and ordered the Public Bus Management Office to follow them. Director Xu will also go to inspect at any time in order to improve them.</p>

<p>Mao Xiaolong, a native of Dinghai, lived in Chongque, Songjiang, and worked in salt farming. On January 13 of last year, he went to Caojing, Songjiang, to shop and returned home. At 1:40 PM, while passing by the Caojing branch station of the Zhejiang Highway, he was accidentally crushed to death by the US Consul in Shanghai, Mu Jue, who was driving carelessly. Mao Zhongfu, a representative of the family of the deceased, reported to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, requesting negotiations for compensation. The association, according to the situation, separately sent letters to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, requesting them to take charge of the matter. Since the incident occurred, more than a year has passed. Although the government has negotiated with the US ambassador, the matter has been delayed and unresolved due to legal procedures and the other party's excuses. Recently, the association collected evidence again, drew a detailed map of the accident site, and asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the US ambassador and forward it to the US prosecutor for reconsideration.

<p>Zhang Jingtang, the leader of the third district investigation team of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Team, currently stationed in Baoshan, in view of the frequent appearances of sea bandits in the downstream ports of the Yangtze River since the year before, who have been entrenched in looting and causing disturbances, has often opened fire. Previously, due to the period of suppression, he had no time to take care of the rear, which has led to the resurgence of bandits recently. According to confidential reports from informants, he sent officers Chen Jianting and others to Huxupu and Lingdian Port to arrest the ruthless bandits Wang Ruihua, Ma Defu, Shen Sanmazi, etc., and seized a bandit ship and a large number of guns and bullets. They were immediately sent to the Baoshan team headquarters. After Director Zhang interrogated them one by one, they confessed that they had robbed the Qinglonggang Maifeng rowing boat, Xinkou cotton boat, and garlic, fresh pork, kerosene, and other items on the river surface in Haimen last October and divided the proceeds. The confession was recorded and submitted to the district headquarters for interrogation. It is now heard that after interrogation by the district headquarters, they have been transferred to the Nantong Security Division for punishment according to the law.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 8:00 AM, a warehouse house at No. 37 Wanjuma Tou Street, Nanshi, collapsed suddenly, killing a dockworker on the spot and injuring two others. One was sent to Baolong Hospital and died soon after, and the other was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Steel Stacked Inside the House</p>
<p>The owner of the house, surnamed Zhou, entrusted Shen Yuanlai Tung Oil Firm at No. 221 Luma Road to rent out the house. The house was rented out to Renji Steel Firm at No. 618 Luma Road as a warehouse by Sheng Xiqi, the manager of Yuanlai Firm, two years ago. However, the house was built of brick and wood and had been in disrepair for many years, so the Municipal Bureau of Public Works had repeatedly ordered the owner to rebuild it. The owner did not repair it immediately because the house was rented to Renji and was stacked with heavy steel.</p>
<p>Wall Collapses, Beam Falls, People Crushed</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 8:00 AM, when dockworkers Teng Jinhe (42 years old, Wuxi), Tang Quangen (37 years old, Wuxi), and Du Axiang (36 years old, Wuxi) were carrying steel bars in the Renji Steel Firm warehouse, a south-facing brick wall of the house collapsed suddenly due to the excessive pressure of the steel bars and other iron parts, which could not support it. The beams and roof on the wall fell down, causing the three people working there to be unable to escape and were crushed. Other dockworkers tried to get the bodies of the three out one by one.</p>
<p>Teng Jinhe Dies Immediately</p>
<p>However, Teng Jinhe among them, because his head was broken and his brains were cracked, died on the spot. Du Axiang, who was left, was sent to Shilong Hospital for treatment by car, but due to the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at about 12:00 PM. Tang Quangen, who was injured, is now being treated at Shanghai Hospital, but his life is also in extreme danger. After the incident, the No. 16 Police Sub-bureau in charge, because the owner of Renji, Shen Songnan, was not in Shanghai, summoned Rong Rongpei, the manager of the firm, for questioning. Because the matter concerned human life, it ordered Lu Yongde, the land chief of No. 16, to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an inquest. Then, at about 5:00 PM, Inspector Xie, commissioned by the court, arrived at the scene with examiners and other personnel for an inquest. After the inquest, it was confirmed that the deceased Teng Jinhe died from being crushed during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his family for coffin preparation and burial. The inquest was completed and returned to the court.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Glorious Memorial in the Football World - Donghua Wins Four Championships - Won the Group A Championship Again Yesterday by Beating the Jewish Team 6-1 - French Business Team Wins Group A Runner-Up Title - Youyou Sits Comfortably in Third Place - Today the French Business Team Forfeits the Game Against Donghua - <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Although the Donghua football team was punished and three players could not play, their prestige remained undiminished. Yesterday, they played against the Jewish team in Yiyuan and won a big victory with a score of 6-1. In the Western League Group A league, nine teams participated, and each team had to meet twice, for a total of sixteen games. Although Donghua still has three games left, they have already obtained 24 points, ranking first. Furthermore, the French Business team voluntarily forfeited today's game between Donghua and the French Business team, so they obtained another two points without effort, for a total of 26 points. The Group A championship has been won by Donghua. Thus, this season, the Donghua Group A and B teams have successively won four major championships, including the Historical Gotha Cup, the Group C Cup, and the Junior Cup, setting a new record unprecedented in history. In particular, the Historical Gotha Cup, which Chinese teams had never won before, was also won by this team, which is truly fortunate.</p>
<p>Donghua Wins Big Against the Jewish Team</p>
<p>The Jewish Team Shows Courage at the Beginning: Yesterday's game between the two sides was not tense, as the military strength was very different, resulting in a one-sided situation. However, at the beginning of the game, the Jewish team, like newborn calves who are not afraid of tigers, launched an attack. At that time, the Jewish five forwards attacked the city together, and Donghua was in a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, Guan and Li, the two defenders, and Gu Shangquan, etc., bravely resisted and saved the dangerous ball. Chen Yutian grabbed a ball and passed it to Li Yichen, who kicked it smoothly. The ball was fast and clear. Dietrit wanted to save it but could not, and watched the ball enter, creating a 1-0 advantage. This was twenty minutes after the start of the game. Five minutes later, the Jewish team illegally tackled a player, and a penalty kick was awarded. Gu Shangquan took the kick and the ball went in, winning with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>The First Half Ends with a Score of 4-0: The Jewish team, having lost two goals in a row, also tried to avenge themselves, and launched another attack, but were all repelled by the Dong generals. Later, Li Yichen also had the opportunity to take a penalty kick, and kicked it hard, but because he was too eager, he kicked it over the net and missed. Li Yichen was very unwilling, and fought alone to create a score of 3-1. At 3:35, Donghua's Li Ning was attacked by the enemy team, resulting in an injury and falling to the ground, and had to leave the field for a break. After a while, he re-entered the battle. Later, the Donghua generals continued their efforts and attacked together. The Jewish team was very overwhelmed by this. Qian Zuozi found an opportunity in the chaos and gently kicked the ball into the net, and Donghua won with a score of 4-0.</p>
<p>Gu Shangquan Makes Contributions in the Second Half: After the lemon time, Donghua's heroic style remained the same. The vanguard of Li, Chen, and Dai showed great power. The Jewish Dietrit used his body to deflect the ball out, but accidentally kicked a Donghua player, and was judged by the referee to be a penalty kick. Gu Shangquan still took the kick, making the score 5-0.</p>
<p>6-1, Fortunately Avoiding the Egg: Seeing that the national situation was precarious, the Jewish team was unwilling to suffer the shame of being blanked, and quickly whipped the horse. The five generals of the front line bravely moved forward. Taggman fueled his feet, L. Greenberg launched an offensive on the border, S. Greenberg dribbled the ball and attacked, crossing two lines of defense. The ball entered the net, Guan Taian was helpless, and simply became polite, resulting in a score of 6-1, avoiding the egg. Afterwards, Donghua's Qian Zuozi dribbled the ball straight in, but the ball flew too high and went over the net. Although the Jewish team struggled to resist, it was ultimately ineffective. Finally, Jia Youliang passed to Li Yichen, who went straight to the Yellow Dragon and kicked it in, ending the game with a score of 6-1. Donghua won a big victory.</p>

<p>Youyou Wins the Runner-Up Title</p>
<p>In another Group A game yesterday, the French Business team played against the Western Police team at Shenyuan. According to the Western Police team's record, they were only one point behind Youyou. If the Western Police team won against the French Business team in this game, they would win the runner-up title. If they lost, the runner-up title would be won by Youyou. Therefore, the Western Police team tried their best to cope. However, the French Business team was stubborn and unwilling to show weakness, so the battle was very fierce. As a result, the French Business team won with a score of 5-3, indirectly benefiting Youyou, and the runner-up title was won by Youyou.</p>
<p>French Business Team Forfeits Today</p>
<p>Only one Group A game is scheduled today, between Donghua and the French Business team, which was originally scheduled to be held at Shenyuan. It is now known that the French Business team voluntarily forfeited, so there will be no game today. Donghua will add two more points, and the championship has been won. There are still two games left, and it is feared that they will be abandoned and not played, because Donghua must set off tomorrow to go to Gao [unclear] for the competition. The current standings of each Group A team are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Games Played Wins Draws Losses Goals Scored Goals Conceded Points</p>

<h3 id="e171">China Football Zhongzi Group - Weihua Wins Six Out of Six Games - High Hopes for the Championship <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>In the China Football Association's Zhongzi Group, a total of five teams participated, adopting a cyclic system. Currently, Weihua has won six out of six games and is in first place, with very high hopes for the championship. The team still has two games left against Fudan and Zhenru. They only need to win one more game to win the championship, as Fudan has already lost once and drawn once, while Zhenru has lost twice and drawn once. Zhenru has absolutely no hope, and Fudan still has to play against Zhenru, Weihua, and the Merchant Ship each once. If they can win all of them, they will still be one point short of Weihua. If Zhenru also beats Weihua, the championship will belong to Fudan. Therefore, the future situation is worth noting. Moreover, Weihua's lineup does not seem as good as before. The situation of each team is as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Games Played Wins Draws Losses Points</p>
<p>Weihua 6 6 0 0 12</p>
<p>Fudan 5 3 1 1 7</p>
<p>Zhenru 6 3 1 2 7</p>
<p>Leji 8 2 0 6 4</p>
<p>Merchant Ship 7 1 0 6 2</p>
<p>Weihua Wins Big Against Leji Yesterday: Yesterday, in the Zhongzi Group, there was only one game between Weihua and Leji, held at the Xianshi Stadium on Jiangwan Road. The stadium area was small, rugged, and uneven. Moreover, after a long period of rain, the low-lying areas on both sides were flooded with water like small rivers. Both sides were fighting a water battle, with no artistry at all. In the first half, Weihua's offensive was very strong, scoring eight goals. In the second half, they did things perfunctorily, and Leji's entire army was conservative, losing only one goal. As a result, Weihua won big with a score of 9-0. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Guanjin Up Xu Jinbiao Down</p>
<p>Shao Yougong Lu Yunxi</p>
<p>Wang Tang Ma Wenjun Wu Jialu</p>
<p>Cao Chuyun Tan Guofang Deng Zhiyang Cao Qinfang Zhang Jinhai</p>
<p>Fudan Merchant Ship Rescheduled Today: Originally, a game between Fudan and Merchant Ship was scheduled for 3:00 p.m. today at the Wusong Merchant Ship School. It has now been rescheduled due to some reason.</p>

<p>Championship Prediction: There are as many as fourteen teams participating in this competition. The teams with the highest voices for the championship are Inness, the French Army, and the Russian Overseas Chinese. The Shanghai Athletics Competition Promotion Association's organized Shanghai Union team, with famous players He Baoshan, Jin Kang, and Wang Zhenglin, has a relatively average strength and should not be underestimated. According to those familiar with this field, they are quite optimistic about this cross-country run. The excellent members of Blue Inness are scattered in the Group A and B teams. Although the Russian Overseas Chinese have Li Fu Qinggu and Qie Qie Li Fu, their strengths are uneven and useless. There are no outstanding talents in the French Army, the same as the Russian Overseas Chinese. Moreover, the current route is six miles, which is suitable for the physique of the Chinese. After starting, they first pass the Jiangwan Road asphalt road, then the cinder road after the swimming pool. Crossing the wooden bridge north is a gravel road, and then the rural fields, dirt roads, and ditches, Xiangyin Road, entering the East Sports Association Road, Jiangwan Road, and reaching the finish line inside the park, for a total of one mile and three quarters and something more. The Chinese have always been afraid of mud roads and ditches and cannot compete with strong enemies. Only by entering Xiangyin Road can they exert everything. If it does not rain, there will be a chance to win the championship.</p>

<p>The City Education Bureau's plan to build a public sports ground in the Guanshanbei district was initiated in the 16th year of the Republic of China in response to the needs of the citizens and the request of the City Party Headquarters. Several sports experts were hired to engage in design, and the abandoned base of the Liuying Road barracks was found for the purpose of setting up the sports ground. It was submitted to the municipal government on September 6th of the 17th year for approval to allocate its use, establish boundary stones, and issue notices. Later, due to a dispute between the Ministry of Military Administration and the property rights, the layout was temporarily suspended. After repeated negotiations by the municipal government, the Executive Yuan (the 207th council meeting held on the 9th) decided to order the Ministry of Military Administration to allocate the base to the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, the Bureau is now actively preparing for the construction of the Zhabei Sports Ground.</p>

In particular, their performance against the rising star Langya team and the Zu Ci team, the recent runner-up of the Yili Cup composed of Shanghai elites, was amazing. They swept them both with a score of 6-1. Their players, such as Hu Jinying, Chen Guowei, Zhu Jiji, and Liang Wenhuan, are all veterans on the field, and their excellent skills have long been impressed on the audience. Last night (13th) was the match between Tao Ying and the Shanghai champion Guangdong team, which was also Tao Ying's farewell match in Shanghai. One is the Macao champion team, and the other is the Shanghai champion team. The meeting of two heroes is no less than an inter-city competition between Macao and Shanghai.

<p>Proclamation to Compatriots on Promoting Literacy Education</p>
<p>In order to promote literacy education, the committee issued the following proclamation to compatriots yesterday: Dear compatriots, you probably all know the pain of being illiterate. An illiterate person cannot keep accounts, write letters, read newspapers, understand posters on the wall, understand government notices, or understand the general trends of the world. Sometimes, it is simply like having eyes but not being able to see, becoming a seeing blind person. Their suffering is truly indescribable. In China, it is said that 80 out of 100 people are illiterate. Shanghai also has hundreds of thousands of people. To relieve the suffering of the people and revitalize our nation, we must first make these many illiterate people literate. To this end, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Government, we will soon begin a large-scale literacy education movement. It is planned that within this year, hundreds of thousands of illiterate men, women, old and young in Shanghai will have the opportunity to become literate. The methods we use are: First, dividing Shanghai into twelve districts, and establishing dozens of schools in each district, forcing illiterate people to study for one hour a day, not only without tuition fees, but also giving away books. They can graduate after studying for two months. Second, for some people who really cannot go to school to study, we will send teachers to their homes to provide individual guidance. After two months, if they pass our exams, we can also give them graduation certificates. At that time, they will be able to keep accounts, write letters, and read simple newspapers. Not only will it be convenient for themselves, but the entire Shanghai will feel benefited. However, before the investigation, we cannot start these methods, because we do not yet know who is illiterate, how many illiterate people there are, who can go to school in the morning, who can go to school in the evening, and who really cannot go to school. How can we set up schools and send teachers? Therefore, we plan to start dispatching a large number of investigators from April 10th in the Jiangwan experimental zone, from April 20th in the Nanshi experimental zone, and from May 8th in the other twenty districts, wearing signs, to conduct on-site investigations and also persuade illiterate people to go to school. As mentioned above, this literacy education movement is obviously a very heavy and difficult task. We have few people and limited capacity, so we cannot but hope that all sectors of society will support us. May China be fortunate.</p>
<p>Mayor Reports on Implementation Measures</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Literacy Education Committee and Mayor, will report on the implementation of literacy education measures at 9:30 am tomorrow (Monday) during the city government's commemoration week, and has stipulated and notified the following personnel to participate: (1) Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Education Association, Shanghai Farmers' Association, Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions each send two responsible representatives to participate; (2) All staff of the Shanghai Education Bureau participate; (3) Principals or academic directors of all public and private primary and secondary schools in this city participate; (4) Section chiefs in charge of the Public Security Bureau, and directors and chiefs of various sub-bureaus participate; (5) Municipal committee members of various districts participate.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the sixth day of the National Reading Movement Conference organized by the China Culture Construction Association. The association specially invited Li Ximou, Dean of the College of Science of National Jinan University, to speak on "How to Study Natural Science." Today (14th) at 3:15 pm, the association invited Sun Hanbing to broadcast "How to Study Politics" at Zhongxi Radio Station. The full text of Li Ximou's speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Definition of Natural Science</p>
<p>The China Culture Construction Association, for the purpose of guiding young people in academic research, has specially invited scholars to give various academic research lectures. Today, I am asked to speak on "How to Study Natural Science." I have little in-depth research on natural science. Today, I can only share the research methods and personal experiences with you. To study natural science, we must first understand what natural science is. We live in the universe. The various forms and things in the universe are constantly changing. If we can organize and classify them in a reasonable way, and use various experiments, investigations, calculations, etc. to prove and explain the unclear or doubtful points, and only stop after the verification is beyond doubt, then the knowledge that specifically studies all the phenomena of nature can be called natural science. Mr. Ren Hongjun once defined natural science as "knowledge that is formed by collecting and regulating the natural phenomena in the universe according to logical methods." I think this definition is quite complete and worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Motivation for Studying Science</p>
<p>The motivation for studying natural science can be said to come with life. Since the existence of mankind, the interest and need to study natural science can be said to have never been interrupted. If we break it down, there are two reasons: one is due to curiosity and the desire for knowledge. The movement of the sun, moon, and stars, and the changes of wind, rain, snow, and ice in nature have long been felt strange and frightening by primitive people. Therefore, there are traces of early research in astronomy in ancient times. The earliest development of astronomy in natural science is clear evidence of mankind's curiosity and desire for knowledge about natural phenomena. The second reason is due to the needs of the environment. The four major needs of human life are clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If there is a separation from natural science, natural science will naturally grow with human history and become more and more prosperous with the level of human culture. To give the most famous example, the invention of geometry in Babylon and Egypt was due to the needs of the environment at that time.</p>
<p>Science and Non-Science</p>
<p>The distinction between science and non-science has a definite boundary, which we cannot confuse at will. In Chinese history, there are so-called Suirenshi drilling wood to make fire, as well as the invention of the compass, papermaking, paint making, winemaking, gunpowder, printing, the manufacture of boats and vehicles, the invention of porcelain, etc. Generally, people think that ancient Chinese natural science was very prosperous. In fact, these are just fragments of scientific technology and scientific knowledge, and not what is now called true science. True science must have systematic explanations and reasonable analyses. For example, drilling wood to make fire, why can drilling wood make fire? This is because the friction of the object increases, heat is generated by friction, combustion occurs by heat generation, and the function and effect of fire are generated by combustion. Such a systematic explanation and the resulting conclusion is scientific. Therefore, the difference between science and non-science is that science pursues the causes of its occurrence, the phenomena in the process, and seeks its conclusions. If it is a fragment of scientific skills and scientific knowledge, we cannot call it science.</p>
<p>Conditions and Spirit</p>
<p>Regarding the method of studying natural science, the British scholar Russell once said that the scientific method has a necessary condition, one is observation and the other is inference. The so-called observation is to put it in the laboratory to experiment, and the so-called inference is to use our reason to infer. Only experiments can observe correctly, and only inferences can be accurate. Personally, I think Russell's two sentences are indeed true. As for the spirit of studying natural science, one is to respect reality, the second is to value accuracy, the third is to observe signs, the fourth is to judge, and the fifth is to maintain doubt.</p>
<p>Basic Knowledge of Science</p>
<p>Studying natural science is just like studying other subjects. If you want to study ancient Chinese society, you must have a deep foundation in oracle bone inscriptions, ancient geography, and ancient history. The basic subjects for studying natural science are mathematics and mechanics. Assuming that there is no solid foundation in mathematics and mechanics and in-depth research, it is impossible to even touch the threshold of natural science. Scientific knowledge is so superficial and narrow among the Chinese intelligentsia, and the interest of Chinese students in mathematics and mechanics is so low and lacks interest. When we recall the close relationship between natural science and the strength of modern countries, it is really regrettable.</p>
<p>Methods of Studying Science</p>
<p>Finally, I want to give you a serious attention. We will not talk about saving the country, but if we want to talk about saving the country, we must study natural science. Otherwise, empty talk about saving the country is like the late Southern Song Dynasty. Empty talk about science is no different from the Qing Dynasty's restoration. Young students across the country should be afraid of the nation's decline, the country's crisis, and the shrinking of its territory. If you want to work hard to save the country and the people, it cannot be reversed by the courage of blood and the strength of an ordinary person. You must be down-to-earth and deeply enter the garden of science. To study natural science, you must have the following four basic methods. The first is mental training. To make your understanding clear and your thinking thorough, you must study philosophy, logic, and psychology. Those who study natural science can go deeper into the hall and gain deeper knowledge only after being trained in philosophy, logic, and psychology. The second method is to work hard and study diligently. Chinese scholars are harmed by taking a quick glance and not seeking thorough understanding. If you want to study a profound subject, you must not study it repeatedly day and night, and what will you gain? The second method must be focused. One day of exposure to the sun and ten days of cold will not help. You must exhaust your life's energy to gain something. The fourth method is to experiment. Natural science certainly requires hard thinking, but also emphasizes practical observation. The equipment in the laboratories of our major middle schools is either simple or even lacking experimental equipment. Now that vocational education has been set as the national education policy, I hope that all education administrative agencies and school authorities across the country will pay close attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Survival and Reproduction <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Biwu</p>
<p>Many people who are unwilling or dare not face the current situation are running back to embrace the corpses of the past, and are blowing the terms "motherhood," "motherly love," etc., to the skies. However, the facts tell us that women are indeed seeking to lose their reproductive functions, but cannot. Some would rather sacrifice and not marry or be absolutely celibate in order to avoid falling into the "mother" prison. Some carefully brave dangerous waves, and finally get into big trouble, and use abortion to fight with their unborn children. The so-called "mother" is more cruel than jackals, tigers, lions or enemies.</p>
<p>The gentlemen who uphold morality may see these facts as being made by women of the new and liberated era, and denounce them. In fact, their old eyes are blurred. Truly new and liberated women do have abortions for the sake of life and work. But a large number of modern girls have abortions, but it is not for the sake of liberation. In addition to these two types of women who have abortions, there is a third type of women who do this, but they have long been overlooked by the gentlemen who uphold morality. Because they were originally self-generated and self-destructed like weeds, and their actions in life are difficult to hang on people's words. But in fact, the number of small lives strangled or destroyed from the wombs of these weed-like women is many times more than the first two types of women. It's just because their actions are silent and in the dark corners of the house, so there is no way to count them.</p>
<p>According to the report, a young woman from Zhenjiang, Shen Chen, came to Shanghai to work as a servant due to poverty, but she was already pregnant. She was deeply worried that it would be inconvenient to work for a long time, so she privately used a dried radish to try to get the fetus to fall. Unexpectedly, the effect was not seen, and the woman was in extreme pain. Later, a doctor removed it for her, and she was fortunate to be reborn. However, because the abortion violated the criminal law, the court sentenced her to two years in prison.</p>
<p>The fact that this matter was able to appear in the newspaper is because it happened in civilized Shanghai, with well-informed patrol houses and newspaper reporters. The second is because it was not medicine that was used, and although the fetus moved, it did not fall, so it was revealed. If there were not these two conditions, it would have been nothing. Don't you see that in the countryside, it is difficult to find one or two out of a hundred poor women who die from abortions who are told about?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that abortion is harmful to health and even life-threatening, and there is also the terror of punishment. However, women still take the risk. What is it that gives them the courage? It's nothing more than to get "survival". The desire for survival is stronger than anything else. For the sake of survival, they can build or destroy all the respectable, lovely, terrible and terrifying human things. In recent years, most women have embarked on a dead end. She can't take care of herself, how can she be expected to accept the great righteousness of cultivating talents for the country? Today, it is natural to watch the race die out day by day.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people curse women for being so selfish and wanting to survive, and not willing to reproduce. However, okay! What happens if women even dispel their desire to survive? What can you do?</p>
<p>Since society ignores the survival of women and does not give her a way to survive, she cannot give society reproduction. Even if the laws are strict, her contraception, which is more passive than abortion, cannot be stopped by anyone. If so, this ground may only leave green grass for others to graze.</p>
<p>Since we still have a breath left, we always want our nation to last for ten thousand years. For the many facts that we have heard and seen about women who are unwilling to reproduce, I really hope that society will liberate women, so as to liberate society itself, and open up a way for the survival of the nation.</p>
<p>Women's Issues Lecture</p>
<h3 id="e189">Section 2: The Enslaved Life of Women <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Junhui</p>
<p>In ancient Greece and Rome, with the development of private property and the strengthening of the slave system, men had already taken away women's right to participate in social production. They were no longer the main producers of wealth in the national economy! They were driven from the vast field of social production into the family, and transformed from social beings into family slaves!</p>
<p>What is a family slave? The meaning of her existence is first to satisfy the sexual desires of her husband, that is, the head of the family; second, to bear the husband's offspring; third, to ensure the accuracy of the husband's legitimate children and not to communicate with other men; and fourth, to be confined to the bedroom and kitchen, as long as they are docile and obedient, and not to resist!</p>
<p>The male-centered Greek Athens was the first to set various moral laws and laws to deprive women of their freedom and punish women's resistance. The so-called Solon's new law for the republic stipulated that women who committed adultery would be punished with death, or their husbands would sell them as slaves, but men were allowed to be free. This is a typical law of a male-dominated country!</p>
<p>The wives and daughters of free citizens in Greece and Rome naturally had much better material lives than female slaves, but they were also equally without rights and unfree. Married women were completely subordinate to their husbands, living a long-term "prostitution" slave life in a cage-like family. Unmarried women were subordinate to their parents, without the right to choose their husbands, and were deeply imprisoned in their boudoirs, waiting for their parents to sell them. Their precious lives were consumed in dark bedrooms and kitchens until the day they died!</p>
<p>Regarding the life of Greek women at that time, a comedy writer described it as follows!</p>
<p>"Of all things, spiritual and physical,</p>
<p>Ah! The most miserable existence, is really us women!</p>
<p>We have to be sold to our husbands with a dowry, - the worst is that our bodies also belong to him.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of person he is, good or bad,</p>
<p>This danger is most alarming - because divorce is an insult to women, and women are not allowed to refuse their husbands.</p>
<p>......Excerpt......</p>
<p>Men can avoid the troubles at home, and can find comfort outside,</p>
<p>Beside friends, in the ranks of peers - while we have to stay at home alone!</p>
<p>They often say that women are in no danger,</p>
<p>Staying at home during their war.</p>
<p>What a foolish fallacy! I would rather go to the battlefield three times than go through childbirth once!" (See "Women and Society")</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, men strictly prohibited other men from infringing on their wives and daughters, but they themselves constantly pursued the wives and daughters of others. Thus, in order to alleviate this contradiction, the famous prostitution system in Greece was born! Solon, who drafted the new law of Athens, actually set up state-run brothels and openly practiced a perverted polygamy system. A shameless Athenian man openly said:</p>
<p>"We marry a woman because we want legitimate children and a loyal mistress of the house. We use maids for bedside care and daily service. We prostitute ourselves for the enjoyment of love." (Ibid.)</p>
<p>However, prostitutes at that time were not female slaves who could be bought and sold at will, but female citizens who bravely lived a free life, transcending all moral laws that bound women! They had noble education and were quite accomplished in learning, and they bravely participated in political activities. For example, Aspasin, Lais, Phryne, Leona, Archeanassa, etc. are all famous prostitutes in history. Archeanassa was the lover of the great philosopher Plato, Aspasin was a good friend of the great philosopher Socrates, and Phryne was also a social butterfly in the Greek aristocracy! Leona, a prostitute around 500 BC, participated in the political conspiracy to oppose the usurpation of the power of the republic by the usurper at that time, and was arrested together with his comrades. Under cruel torture, she refused to confess the truth, and bit off her own tongue and spat it on the face of the judge!</p>
<p>In this way, the prostitutes at that time had noble knowledge and character, and freely associated with the upper class. This can be said to be another manifestation of women's resistance to the bondage of male power after the collapse of the matriarchal system!</p>
<p>In addition, there were outstanding female scholars in Greece, and they made many contributions to culture, and many of their disciples were thinkers. For example, Asfo was a famous female poet, Agnozhika was the first female doctor who wore men's clothes to study medicine and engaged in medical skills, and Ibachia, a beautiful female professor from Alexandria, was a great philosopher. Scholars from all over the world came from thousands of miles away for her lectures!</p>
<p>In this way, although women at that time were absolutely oppressed by male power on the one hand, they fully demonstrated the spirit of struggle and resistance on the other hand! Let's take a look at the famous Greek comedy "Women's National Assembly"! Here, the heroine, Prok-Su-Go-La, actually proposed a bill for the common ownership of property, which is noteworthy. She proposed:</p>
<p>I demand that everything should be shared in common, and everything should belong to everyone. From now on, the rich and the poor should be eliminated. It should be eliminated that some people do not even have a burial ground while others own vast land. Women should also become common property. They should be allowed to have children with the men they like. (See "Labor Women's Revolution")</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a bill proposed by Greek women against private property, forced marriage, and the slave status of women. This is a protest raised by women around 400 BC, that is, 2,500 years ago, but it has not been realized to this day! No! Sure enough, in some parts of the world, it is being better realized!</p>
<h3 id="e190">German Women Under Hitler (Continued) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Translation of Mrs. Wulen's Speech</p>
<p>Expulsion from Public Life</p>
<p>The most achievable thing for Hitler after seizing power was the complete expulsion of women from public life and from the industrial world! From 1919 to 1932, female parliamentarians from all parties except the National Socialist Party could participate in the German parliament, and they all completed their missions well. Among them, such as population issues, food issues, and the protection of productive labor women, their achievements in the parliamentary committee related to women were the most remarkable.</p>
<p>However, since the general election in 1933, there have been no female members of parliament. No women have participated in the important positions in various government departments, and men have replaced the positions of female school operators and married female teachers. What is most noteworthy is that the intervention of the Third Reich even extended to civil servants. The Constitution of 1919 "repealed all discriminatory treatment against female civil servants." As a result, women who had been confined before actively participated in various occupations. However, according to the latest regulations, women with 35 years of continuous work can obtain the status of permanent staff. In particular, regardless of the Aima Constitution, even though labor is the same, women's wages are lower than men's, which is very detrimental to women.</p>
<p>Family Life in Crisis</p>
<p>The fact that women are withdrawing from the industrial world can be seen concretely in the changes in numbers. When the National Socialist Party first seized power, the number of women employed was 11.5 million, accounting for 36% of users. Only 6 million women were employed. By May 1934, it had dropped sharply to 3 million.</p>
<p>Germany's policy of expelling productive labor women in order to revive family life is actually destroying families. On May 13, 1934, Dr. Bleek, the Minister of the Interior, said: "Whoever can truly fulfill their biological obligations should be given special rights. Therefore, it is impossible and unjust for mothers with many children to work in the workplace. On the one hand, mothers are burdened with the burden of life, and on the other hand, their health is weakened by several pregnancies and births. They do not need to engage in factory labor, and young and strong women should also stay at home."</p>
<p>Although all freedom of speech has been deprived, it is noteworthy that the call against the abolition of women's employment is issued by women themselves. For several weeks, the outline of the employment regulations issued by the Berlin City Council was posted on bulletin boards throughout Berlin.</p>
<p>The organ magazine of the National Socialist Women's Department, the July 1934 issue, recorded the following on this issue:</p>
<p>"This program, of course, gives abnormal shock and fear to senior professional women and even staff members over the age of . In particular, the following items are very abhorrent to all intellectual women. That is,</p>
<p>"(3) German young women - clinging to pots and pans, sweeping the floor, etc., in this way, you can get your wishful husband. Recognize your calling - act according to your calling! Do not think that the ease of stores and offices is more valuable than your future duties as a housewife. Home will make you healthier, more vibrant, and more vigorous."</p>
<p>(4) Labor women—instead of engaging in affairs, it is better to learn to be a wife. Don’t leave men at home, go home yourself, and let your profession be given to men. Otherwise, they will have no other prospects except being indirectly supported by your little bit of work. In fact, old-age insurance is useless. Make your life meaningful! Otherwise, your spirit and body will have nothing but ruin?”</p>
<p>“(7) Our housewives—don’t take away the work of your husband and son. Servants at home are needed because you don’t do it.”</p>
<p>The seventh item deprives middle-class women of the right to paid labor, and they have to dismiss their servants and handle all housework themselves.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party prohibits women from engaging in paid labor, and women are in a state of semi-slavery of unpaid labor. The following is recorded on the public announcement of the Minister of Labor.</p>
<p>“In the spring of 1934, 60,000 female students graduated from elementary education, most of whom could not find employment. However, sitting idly by is not their wish. Therefore, they have to be engaged in "housework practice", and open German families for this purpose as much as possible.”</p>
<p>In this way, housewives of all classes dismiss the servants they have always used, and unconditionally use these girls as unpaid semi-slaves. Because the girls who practice housework are sent to the landlords' homes in the countryside to engage in agricultural work. According to the report of the headquarters of the Labor Exchange Bureau, "There are no more unemployed women. On March 31, 1934, there were still 575,074 unemployed women. However, the Ministry of Finance wants to completely eliminate unemployed women in 1934. The remaining must choose one of marriage, housework practice, and farming. In any case, all owners of cities are not allowed to hire women to occupy men's positions."</p>
<p>What women fear most is engaging in agricultural work, so they often do not register even if they are unemployed, but such things are punished when the authorities know about it.</p>
<p>In this way, under the current situation in Germany, women have completely reduced some of the results that they have worked hard to obtain for decades, and are sent back to the Middle Ages. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e191">People Lingering on the Line of Life <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Yun</p>
<p>I spent two autumns lying in my own bed, and one spring living among those suffering people. When I felt a certain kind of pressure on my health, I would remember that hospital, remember that group in the hospital. All oppression can be resisted, only health oppression is the most irresistible.</p>
<p>A person who has never stayed in a hospital will not be terrified of hospitals.</p>
<p>People who love life are brought here to seek life, and people who love death are also carried here to force them to live; but people who love life often cannot live, while many people who love death leave alive. Many children are carried from the delivery room to the nursery, and many people are carried from the ward to the morgue. The hospital is like this, a place that eternally stages this terrible drama.</p>
<p>Almost every two or three days, someone who attempted suicide is carried in. The reasons for their desire to die are often very complicated. Human psychology is truly incomprehensible. A person who is willing to die and is almost dead is always revived with surgery. But when they can feel themselves struggling on the edge of life and death, they are left there unattended, as if the matter is over. When these rescued people can walk, they often appear in the corridors outside the wards with their weak bodies. Are they truly saved? I cannot know.</p>
<p>People always love life more. As long as they are given another chance to live, they always want to live. So many people endure so much torment on hospital beds year after year, all for the sake of living. They don't know when a high fever or pain will strike them. Delirium and moans constantly fill the space; sometimes they are carried down covered with a large white cloth, and when they are carried back up after being butchered, they still haven't opened their eyes. Tian Han put it well: a person is a machine, and when it breaks, it has to be brought here to be repaired, but doctors are not omnipotent mechanics! When they ask the doctor, "When will I get better?" the doctor points to the sky and says, "Ask Him." They look at the tall trees outside the fence, from bare branches to tender leaves, from tender leaves to being covered in green. All living things climb upwards, but what about them? They have no spring. They are people lingering on the line of life. They want to live, but they have no ability to make themselves live well. So they think of death: "Let me die, this suffering!" They cried. But as long as they think that they have not reached the extreme of life, they endure and carry on.</p>
<p>This is a painful crucible. In addition to their own illnesses, the unfortunate people don't care about unequal material treatment (of course, not everyone is a property owner!), and they cannot get spiritual comfort. The most peaceful time for them is when relatives and friends bring news from outside. I don't think any hospital is reasonable! In the weeks after I was discharged, I often went to see them. Although I went to see the few I knew, I remembered many things about them. When they sighed and said, "I won't get better," I always comforted them, but I knew for sure that two of them, who had been there for more than two years, would never be healthy. Every time I went, I would be restless for two or three days; after that, I didn't go much anymore. I became so afraid of this hospital. When I got sick again last autumn, the doctor wanted me to be hospitalized. I shook my head at him. He said, "Do you know you're courting death?" I thought that as long as half of me hadn't died, I would never go back in. After that, I never went again, but I knew that not all of the few I knew would be able to escape this chain of suffering.</p>
<p>Spring has come again, and I remember those who have no spring, those who linger on the line of life!</p>
<h3 id="e192">A Casual Visit to a Women's Labor Night School <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>The sky was drizzling with rain of a moderate size, and the wind was blowing harder and harder. After running through several long streets with a bare head, I jumped onto the tram. The warm and comfortable atmosphere in the carriage made me feel like I had instantly ascended from hell to heaven. Among the crowd exhaling warm air, just after securing a seat, a strange yet familiar voice, somewhat vague, suddenly came from across:</p>
<p>"Ah, you are...!"</p>
<p>I looked up at a woman with a long, flat face who looked like an elementary school teacher, and also couldn't help but shout:</p>
<p>"Ah, you are...!"</p>
<p>Just like that, in this accidental opportunity, I ran into one of my close classmates from eight years ago; Ms. Zhang Yuying. She was weighed down by the burdens of her family, working as an elementary school teacher like a beast of burden during the day, and teaching at a women's labor night school run by a youth association from seven to nine in the evening. I was drawn by our old friendship, and escorted her all the way to the school, taking the opportunity to observe her work.</p>
<p>The night school itself had no school building. It borrowed three classrooms on the upper floor of an elementary school that had classes during the day. There were more than one hundred students in total, divided into three levels: elementary, advanced, and special. The study period was set at half a year for each level to graduate. The courses included correspondence, Mandarin textbooks, arithmetic, geography, and so on. The most students were in the elementary level, about sixty or seventy, forty or fifty in the advanced level, and more than ten in the special level. It is said that the ladies rarely reach the special level, because they slowly get married, leave, and some cannot continue studying due to changes in their environment.</p>
<p>Although the rain was gradually getting heavier that night, the three large rooms were gradually filling with people. They entered the classroom, and as soon as they sat at their desks, they either started copying or reading. Although there was an unfamiliar person like me among the teachers, they seemed not to see me. Their eagerness for knowledge and the sincere attitude was probably something that was hard to find even in one or two out of a hundred students in noble girls' middle schools and universities.</p>
<p>Soon, a special level student opened a storage box and took out a wall newspaper made by themselves and pasted it on the wall. The content of the wall newspaper included both pictures and articles. The pictures were all selected and clipped from the Shanghai Shen Bao picture special issue. Under each picture, they had their own comments. For example, a picture of a Soviet Russian food sales point, with two or three women in white uniforms selling bread, they wrote below: "The lives of Soviet Russian female workers are so idyllic, what about our lives?" The articles included discussions on "The Death of Ruan Lingyu," "Our Way Out," "Our Enemies," and so on. They knew that Ruan Lingyu's suicide was caused by society.</p>
<p>There were also obvious differences in the clothing and appearance of the one hundred plus people. The people in the elementary level, many of whom were relatively older, were not dressed very well. The special level students were so-so, but already had the appearance of students. The advanced level students were all girls around eighteen years old, and eighty percent of them were very beautifully dressed and made up. If you saw them on the street, you would never recognize them as female workers, especially their shiny black hair, fair skin, delicate and skillful figures and postures, which were simply like old-fashioned rich ladies and young mistresses. I think this also had something to do with their work, because they did light work - female workers in cigarette factories. According to my friend, most of them had very light family burdens, or no family burdens at all; otherwise, they would have to do other work at night, so how could they have the time to study. I suddenly understood, these were probably the so-called "daughters of small families." Their wages, it is said, can earn several to more than ten yuan per month. According to the wall newspaper, the working hours are as long as twelve hours a day.</p>
<p>Although it only costs five cents for registration and buying books is enough for the female workers to enter this labor night school, there are countless people who cannot enroll due to their own living environment, and there are also many people who are limited by the enrollment procedures. It is said that this kind of night school is quite strict in accepting students. Without someone's introduction, without a guarantor – that is, a guarantee that they are good workers – don't even think about getting in. Therefore, the scope of this charitable事业事业 run by the youth association is not very widespread. However, in any case, this is a hundred times more meaningful than the miserable children's carnival they hold on Christmas, if the people involved are really working for the female workers, and not for God.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Diary of a Concubine (Continued) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Lu</p>
<p>April 28th</p>
<p>I moved into the hospital this morning. Chen Ma accompanied me. Usually, Chen Ma doesn't dare to tell me things at home, but here in the hospital, she tells me everything. She has been talking to me almost all day, from the moment I entered the hospital until now. Some problems that I think are too simple, she weeps about and sighs for me. Sometimes, things that I think are too embarrassing, she finds ordinary.</p>
<p>She told me that when she first went to work for many rich wives, she often saw those wives crying and weeping. She always felt that the richer the wife, the more "insatiable" they were. They had so much money to spend and still felt bitter, and still argued with the master. If these wives were all turned into housemaids like her, marrying a poor husband and having to find food as servants, wouldn't they all hang themselves? Wives are too domineering. After watching for a long time, she slowly began to understand some of the suffering of the wives. The only thing that wives have better than maids is that they spend more money, but the anger and rebuffs they suffer are still the same.</p>
<p>She cried again when she said this. She talked about how she was a child bride in the past, how she was scolded as a man's prostitute. When she was farming at home, what kind of suffering she endured for production. Now her husband has a mistress and doesn't want her anymore. As she spoke, she hinted to me: this time, Mr. X sent me to the hospital, and he probably won't take me back to the mansion in the future; he said that he would rent a house for me to live in outside after I give birth.</p>
<p>When I first heard this, I felt a little unnatural, but after calming down, it wasn't a big deal. This is not just my ending, it is the ending of women.</p>
<p>May 29th</p>
<p>It's been more than a month since I wrote in my diary. The doctor said that I am now a very serious "hysteric," and told me to take special care of myself before and after childbirth. They haven't let me do anything this month, they won't even let me write letters, and they've taken away my pen and ink. Yesterday I said I wanted to write a letter to my father, and I only managed to trick them into giving me a pencil. But Chen Ma is constantly watching me all day long. Actually, what benefit is there to me from this kind of surveillance? Even if I don't write in my diary for a year, it won't cure any of my illnesses.</p>
<p>Having moved into the hospital, tonight is the quietest night, and also the loneliest night. Mrs. Wang didn't come to see me, even Miss didn't come, and even Chen Ma was called back by the old lady, and she still hasn't come back by this time.</p>
<p>The shadows of the parasol trees imprinted through the gauze window seem to be telling people: it's late at night, telling people: the world is quiet, telling people: life has come to an end; at the same time, they are also telling people: although it is late at night, a pitch-black late night, but, in the shadows of the parasol trees, there is still the reflection of the bright moon, and in the midst of looking up at that bright moon, there are still people who are clear, bitter, and struggling!</p>

<h3 id="e194">Although Financial Silver Prices Rise, the Margin Has No Major Impact, People's Hearts Are Perverse and the Market Once Rose Sharply, Finally Falling Back Seven Yuan Due to Loose and Rampant Exchange Bills <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was very chaotic yesterday. Although overseas silver markets rose sharply in unison, most people believe that our country is in an extremely bad position and will inevitably find ways to resist. Although foreign silver has soared to a very high level, the spot silver in this port is exhausted, and it is difficult to obtain a large amount of exchange bills. As a result, people's hearts are strangely bullish, and buyers are very enthusiastic. Large short sellers are pessimistic about the margin and have made large bullish bets in London, which has made the gold market even more depleted. Floating shorts, stimulated by the previous dynasty's reaction, dare not engage in any activity. As a result, off-market pre-market trading soared from more than fifty yuan to sixty-six or sixty-seven yuan. At this point, sellers came to supply the source, gradually falling into the sixty yuan range. After the opening, the Central Bank announced the listed price. Both British and American currencies rose, but the customs gold unit fell by two and a half mils. The standard margin price dropped to 871 yuan and two jiao, and the downstream was announced. After entering, the Central Bank and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu poured in shillings, the exchange market hardened, arbitrageurs sold the strips one after another, and the selling pressure turned strong and broke into the fifty yuan mark. The HSBC listed price suddenly increased by 375 and 75. Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu sold fiercely, and it plummeted once. However, because the bank took advantage of the cheap to vigorously buy in, people's hearts were still stable, and soon it rose back to above fifty yuan. The exchange market failed to tighten, and there were many setbacks after the high point. After entering, the silver balance tax did not move, and the selling wind stirred up a second wave, and the decline started again. The Associated Press reported that, according to American eyes, under this soaring silver price, China will be forced to abandon the silver standard and other news. Buyers bought in at low prices, and even large short sellers vigorously covered their positions, and rose back to above fifty yuan. At this time, the power of both sides seeking supply balance was equal, and the exchange market was also stable. The market price then hovered around fifty yuan. At noon, it was slightly tired. The market situation in the first half of the day was strong at first and then tired. This was caused by the loose exchange market, which caused arbitrageurs to come out. However, people's hearts are still stable, and the future is really unpredictable. I am afraid that the reaction will be violent. Next Monday will begin the transfer trading for May and June. Now I will record the market situation in the first half of the day,</p>

<h3 id="e195">Under the dumping by the Central Government and Qiao Zhifu, both British and American exchange rates are loose and rampant, the money market has not been seen to be full and people's hearts are still good, even if the silver price rises, the market has no impact. <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>

The Central Bank and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu dumped in cold weather. HSBC announced a listed price. The British currency rose 375, and the U.S. currency increased by 75. The process was tough, but the banks still had a buying interest while taking advantage of the cheaper prices, and the psychology of Chinese merchants was still stable, so it could be maintained. After entering, the silver balance tax was announced and still had not been changed, and once again became loose. Chinese merchants were still buying, and the Associated Press telegraphed that foreigners believed that China must change its currency system.

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market situation still had not escaped its hovering state. Market prices were even more sluggish, and trading became even more quiet. Occasionally, for a few kinds of stocks with more trading volume, both buyers and sellers stubbornly held their prices. Those entering the market were unwilling to raise prices, and those selling were unwilling to lower prices, each insisting on their own terms. The market situation was historically uneventful. Those in the market who paid slight attention only noted that No. 34 sold off demobilization bonds, while No. 16 also had the same amount entering the market. No. 35 sold off 22 customs bonds, while No. 58 and other scattered traders also had equal demand. However, regarding market prices, these factors mutually restrained each other, unwilling to increase or decrease. Without progress in the environment, market prices would not easily fluctuate. Yesterday's progress saw a slight decrease of about one jiao in the morning's initial session. There were very few transactions. In the next session, it suddenly rose by about one jiao again. There were slightly more swap transactions. The afternoon opening continued slightly firm, still only rising or falling by about one jiao. The closing was extremely chaotic, with slight increases, slight decreases, or no changes at all. Transactions were also extremely mediocre. Overall, the market price results were mixed, mostly with more increases than decreases. The total transaction volume was 8,161,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>A report from New Asia Foreign Firm states that yesterday (the 11th), the New York stock market rose due to the railway utilities and silver stocks performing strongly. Silver stocks were especially strong before closing, as silver prices in Montreal had risen by a full 300 pound sterling, which was the largest daily limit. Traders expect the Ministry of Finance to soon raise silver prices again. The bond market and small exchange stocks had mixed gains and losses. Total daily trading volume was 840,000 shares.

<p>The yarn market is mediocre, with the market state showing a clear brewing trend. This is due to two main reasons: first, although the foreign cotton industry is good, the sharp rise in silver prices makes the market worried about a decline; second, recently, the inventories of various factories have decreased, and the Shanghai gold market has been able to stabilize, calming people's minds. Thus, a situation has formed where both bulls and bears are in a difficult position. General speculators are all adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is presenting a flat and stagnant situation.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn: Tongfeng Covers Short Positions</p>
<p>In the forward market for standard yarn, the prices for each month were in a sluggish state. Trading in the market felt particularly cold. However, Tongfeng covered its short positions in the current month, 200 bales per session, for a total of 800 bales, greatly suppressing the atmosphere of panic. The second and third sessions saw a slight increase. The market situation was extremely dry. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 1, 2, 3, or 4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw no significant improvement in the market situation. However, Tongji also came to cover its short positions in the current month, and Tongfeng continued to enter. The market situation strengthened slightly. By the time of closing, it was heard that the Guangdong merchants were still vigorously purchasing spot yarn, and the total trading volume for the day was about 1,200 bales. Popular sentiment rebounded. As a result, the prices for each month rose by 1 or 3 jiao compared to the morning. It was found that Run Kang sold 1,200 bales, Daji 900 bales, Suilong 450 bales, Hengchang 800 bales, Rui Da 800 bales, and Jin Chang 300 bales. Tongji bought 1,400 bales, Yu Kang 600 bales, Tongfeng 850 bales, Heng De 500 bales, Renfeng 1,000 bales, and Changfeng 250 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and recovered in the afternoon. However, after a large increase in American cotton, it showed a slight reactionary decline. Overseas silver prices continued to rise sharply, but the gold market was not significantly affected, so people's minds were still solid. The market had no major changes. However, both bulls and bears in the near months had liquidation actions. It was found that both Tongji and Changhe had more than 10,000 dan in short positions this month.</p>
<p>Recent Cotton: Both Bulls and Bears Liquidation</p>
<p>In the forward market for standard cotton, the opening price was due to the continued sharp rise in silver prices, and after the rise in American cotton, it fell by 4 to 10 points. Indian cotton was suspended, and there was slight liquidation of floating longs. Each month was down by 5 fen to 1.5 jiao. However, when filming the three closing sessions, it was heard that gold prices were stable and the equalization tax was not changed, so trading in the market was loose. Only Tongcheng Company sold, and the results for each month were down 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, Tongji and Changhe both covered their short positions in the near months, and the market trend rose slightly. However, transactions in the market felt particularly lacking, and the market was not very excited. As a result, each month rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Da Fu sold 3,800 dan, Changfeng 1,100 dan, Rui Da 6,400 dan, Run Kang 2,900 dan, and Da Ji 900 dan. Tongji bought 3,000 dan, Hexing 1,000 dan, Yongda 900 dan, Tonghe 1,000 dan, Da Fu 1,400 dan, Renfeng 1,500 dan, and Changhe 4,800 dan.

<p>In March, the total sales volume of yarn from Chinese and foreign local factories was 39,806 bales, an increase of 9,490 bales compared to the previous month's 29,315 bales. The reason for this prosperity is said to be the development period of spring sales. However, overseas export transactions are still not prosperous due to unfavorable exchange rates.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened because Liverpool's telegram was poor, and the industry purchased new cotton, and the price was mixed. Then, due to the end of the bull market, it went downstream again. However, the market was still lively. According to the Washington side's report, no statement will be issued on the issue of new cotton loans until after planting is completed. However, the market here sought to be affected. Later, because the cloth sold in the previous day was estimated to be about 150% of the current production quantity during the reduced working hours, the industry bought in and the price returned. In the afternoon, it fluctuated uncertainly. At the close, due to the strength of the wheat market, short positions were covered, and the industry bought in, and the trend remained firm. It is estimated that the industry will use 115,000 bales, Liverpool inventory 181,000 bales, British cotton spot rose 10 points, futures fell 5 points, Indian cotton was suspended.

<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The local cotton market has stronger sales in all directions. However, factory demand is not strong, and only merchants are actively purchasing. Market prices are still trending steadily. Actual transactions totaled 449 large bales, 576 small-medium bales, 305 small bales, 137 large pieces, and 130 small bales, for a total equivalent to 4,382 dan and 40 jin in market weight.

<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed a stable-to-soft trend for each month. With foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rose by a huge 8 jiao to 1 yuan, Canada rose by about 2 jiao, etc. After the opening price, with the sudden rise of foreign wheat, people seemed excited, and prices for each month were shouted about 1 fen higher. However, although foreign wheat rose, exchange rates also lengthened. The difference seemed insignificant, so factories continued to sell off, and customer longs instead returned to sell. The market atmosphere became calm. By the afternoon opening, transactions for each month were relatively deserted. Local factories and Yangtze factories continued to sell short, and customer longs also returned to sell. The market gradually declined. In the later stage, if current sales are not strong, it should be considered the final outcome. As a result, the current month fell 1 fen and 1.5 li, May fell 1 fen, June fell 1.5 fen, July fell 1 fen and 2.5 li, August fell 1 fen, and September fell 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the morning opening, showed a stable and quiet trend for each month. With foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rose by more than 8 jiao to 1 yuan, Canada rose by about 2 jiao. When the opening price was given, there was no trading in the current month due to the small number of chips, and bulls and bears watched. Although the distant months showed a trend, the rise was only 2 or 3 fen because the gold price fell back. By the afternoon opening, there were still no transactions in the near term, and the distant months were weak because there were very few buyers and the flour market also fell back. Therefore, people's minds were not strong, and the market atmosphere was dusty. As a result, July fell back by 2 fen and August fell by 1 fen. The spot wheat market remained strong due to the depletion of inventory, and quotations were 2 or 3 fen better than yesterday. A batch of 1,600 bags of Bengbu wheat opened at 3 yuan and 9 jiao 3 fen, and was handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat	April 11	April 12	Change</p>
<p>May	97.875	100.375	Up 2.500</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the sources from each gang arrived at more than 30 shops (a total of more than 6,000 shi of goods). After the market situation seemed to have turned around slightly before noon, people's minds continued to stabilize today, and the sales market was slightly active. Customer gangs contracted purchases of more than 1,000 bags from Weihai, Qingdao, and other gangs, so the situation continued to tighten, and the market color moved upward. It seems that the prices of each thick japonica rice and thin indica rice have increased by a few jiao. However, observing the general trend of the later market, it seems that it is no longer as firm and stable as before, and the situation of stable prices will change.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, 26 or 27 ships arrived from various routes downstream. The market for each type of goods saw some small transactions of white japonica rice, and the rest was normal. The market price of white japonica rice rose by about a jiao, while white yuan rice still showed a soft trend. Other varieties are in a fixed situation.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday's foreign rice market was even more prosperous, with customer demand even stronger. In addition to the continued smooth purchases of the inland gangs, the Changting gang's purchases were also strong, and the Nanjing gang and the North gang also had transactions. The city's transactions totaled 33,000 to 34,000 bags, with Saigon rice having the most transactions, and Saigon Siamese paddy also having transactions of 5,500 bags. More than 30,000 bags of foreign paddy have arrived, and there are still large batches to arrive. The market has already opened up, and future transactions will be strong again, and selling prices may increase, but the pricing is high, and the current selling price of 3 yuan and 9 jiao per hundred jin is still difficult to profit from. Yesterday, Saigon paddy rose by 6 or 7 fen, and Siamese paddy, broken rice, and each type of rice rose by about 1 jiao. Customer indica rice followed up by 5 fen, with 200 bags going from Jiujiang to the inland, while 1,300 bags of hulled indica rice went to the inland.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Soybean Inventory is Low and the Market is Stable <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market situation saw sales only from the Shantou gang. The Guang gang has stopped, the factory is not moving, and there are few inland transactions. Market prices are temporarily stable because the base inventory is not liquidated and there are few sources. A batch of Feihe soybeans was opened at 3 yuan and 4 jiao 6 fen, 2 batches of Siping Street soybeans at 4 yuan and 3 jiao half to 3 jiao 3 fen, a batch of Fanjiatun soybeans at 4 yuan and 4 jiao half, 140 bags of Shashi soybeans at 3 yuan and 4 jiao half, 510 bags of Hankou car soybeans at 3 yuan and 8 jiao 1 fen, 100 bags of Hankou second grade soybeans at 3 yuan and 4 jiao, 400 bags of Hankou late soybeans at 3 yuan and 5 jiao 2 fen to 4 jiao 6 fen, and 156 bags of Hankou ditch soybeans at 3 yuan and 8 jiao half.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Sugar Market: Chaozhou Qing Sugar Slightly Rises; Dongtang Sugar Active <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was firm as before. The guild's marked price was 17 yuan and 8 jiao for #24 coarse granulated white sugar, but there were no transactions. There were no quotas for re-export goods. Taikoo Sugar's B grade was still 18 yuan and 2 jiao. Hechi #89 called for 13 yuan. The local factory's Zhenyu #1 refined white sugar was 17 yuan and 2 jiao, with no change. Chaozhou Qing sugar gradually became scarce in storage, and land prices were tight, so the original price was not willing to accumulate work, and it rose 2 jiao. Tizhuang Qing sugar required 11 yuan, Huanggang Qing sugar 10 yuan and 6 jiao, Huilai Qing sugar 9 yuan and 9 jiao, and Gaolong Qing sugar 9 yuan and 7 jiao, but there were no transactions. Zhiyang opened more than 300 bags at 13 yuan and 4 jiao to 2 jiao, next 13 yuan to 12 yuan and 8 jiao, and more than 100 bags of refined white sugar, with the higher ones at 16 yuan and 9 jiao, and the next at 4 or 5 jiao to 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Another message is that the activities of Dongtang have become an undeniable fact recently. The guild's marked price is mostly mediated by customers, and foreign firms are also active on the guild side. Therefore, general large firms have regarded it as something that can be done. Regarding the previous pain, fortunately, there is fresh and sweet sugar to adjust, without having to mediate. Yesterday's market, such as Taikoo Sugar's "Four Temperature Half" was marked at 17 yuan and 5 jiao half, re-export 5 yuan and 7 jiao 37.5 at 17 yuan and 4 jiao, re-export 5 yuan and 5 jiao half, "Three Two Half" at 17 yuan and 1 jiao half, such as Gao Hechi's goods at 12 yuan and 6 jiao half. If compared, it is indeed much cheaper.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Metals: Lead Inventory Weak <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Recent transactions of lead have been activated, so customer gangs, street gangs, and tea shop gangs have all made purchases. Therefore, the number opened in the past few days is very large. As a result, the inventory on the market has suddenly become weak, so people's minds are solid. The standard opening price has risen steadily, and the market price per dan has increased from 14 yuan to 14 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao. Most people think that overseas prices have been reported to rise, and there is a shortage of spot goods in the local market, so the market may have hopes of rising.</p>

<p>— Only Through</p>
<p>Children's life, I think it's quite flavorful. Although I am no longer a child now, I still think that children's life is worth reminiscing about.</p>
<p>Children have no worries about sex, no economic distress, no difficult problems, and their needs are met. Every day they wake up in their mother's arms, jump and skip to school, receiving basic education for making a living. After class, they play with friends and eat candy. In the evening, yawning, they fall asleep to their mother's lullaby.</p>
<p>Thinking back on this kind of life now, it's truly like ascending to immortality.</p>
<p>Today's children are becoming more and more fortunate. Not only can children bathe in their mother's love, growing up in maternal affection, but also have patient and kind teachers guiding them on how to strengthen their bodies, how to pay attention to their health, how to practice manners, and how to live a communal life, and they will no longer taste the rod.</p>
<p>In addition, look, modern children have so much extracurricular reading material to read. In addition, look, modern children have a joyous and enthusiastic Children's Day. In addition, look, everyone feels that children are China's most hopeful, everyone feels that such a small seed will not be difficult to become a great talent and can be made into a great vessel in the future.</p>
<p>However, I feel that today's children are quite capable of shouldering the great responsibility of revitalizing our country and nation... Here, with one hundred and twenty percent sincerity, I bless the lively and lovely children.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Kant's Words <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Zhi</p>
<p>Kant was a German philosopher who was proficient in various disciplines. He cherished time very much, so he often told people, "A person lives in this world for at most a hundred years; in these hundred years, every second that passes is one second less, so we should cherish time." He was not only a person who cherished time, but also had a fixed schedule for work, study, and rest. People asked him why he did this? He said, "A person's life, with a set time, can be done step by step. Not only can knowledge progress, careers can succeed, but also the body can be trained, and the spirit can be happy."</p>
<p>Children, Kant's cherishing of time and disciplined life is truly worthy of our emulation!</p>
<h3 id="e213">Burning <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>On that Sunday, Fen'er and Fang'er were sitting at home, asking each other about the week's work at school.</p>
<p>Fen'er said first, "Sister! I am very afraid of arithmetic, but even though I am afraid, I still pay attention to it and never neglect it. Sister, what subject are you afraid of?"</p>
<p>Fang'er thought for a moment and said, "I am afraid of science, because this subject requires understanding the principles inside and memorizing them firmly, how difficult! My favorite subject is arithmetic. Which one do you like the most?"</p>
<p>Fang'er said, "I like science, because it is very interesting, why does oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water, isn't this very strange? And it is closely related to our future. If we don't pay attention to science, I am afraid we will not be able to stand in society. Sister! You must work hard!"</p>
<p>Fen'er listened to her sister's words and thought carefully, it was very true.</p>
<p>"Fen'er! Fen'er! Bring me a box of matches!" Fen'er's mother shouted in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Fen'er quickly went to give it to her mother.</p>
<p>When Fen'er came back, she asked her sister, "Sister, I want to ask you, is the weight of straw after it is burned heavier or lighter than before it is burned?"</p>
<p>Fang'er smiled and said, "Sister, are you silly? Straw turns to ashes after it is burned, how can it be heavier than before?"</p>
<p>Fen'er said, "Bah! You're wrong. The weight after burning must be heavier!"</p>
<p>Fang'er said, "I say it must be lighter!" They argued back and forth.</p>
<p>Their father came in from outside, heard them arguing, and said, "You don't need to argue. The right and wrong of everything must have considerable proof."</p>
<p>Their father first found a porcelain bowl, put some iron powder in it, and then weighed it on a scale, knowing its weight. Then it was placed on a triangular iron frame, and fire was used to burn it below. After burning for about four or five minutes, the fire was removed, and when the bowl was cold, it was placed on the scale again, and it was found that the weight was a little heavier, and the iron powder in the bowl had turned into a reddish thing, like iron rust.</p>
<p>Their father said, "Look! The iron powder in the bowl absorbed oxygen when it was burning, so we know that it must be oxygen that causes the change with the iron powder. The weight increases after burning, it must be the weight of oxygen. In short, the weight of everything increases after burning, because it increases a part of the gas."</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Important Problem of Bowel Movements <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>The older brother got out of bed, put on his slippers, and hurried to have a bowel movement. The younger brother smiled and said, "Brother! If you're any later, you're afraid you'll pee in the bed, right?"</p>
<p>The older brother, while having a bowel movement, also smiled and replied, "Brother! This is because you usually don't pay attention to me, I'm not like this today, I'm like this every day. The first important task after I get out of bed every morning is to have a bowel movement. The timing of bowel movements is really an important issue. Think about it: if you suddenly have to have a bowel movement while eating, isn't it annoying? If you suddenly have to have a bowel movement while in class, isn't it annoying? If you suddenly have to have a bowel movement during a competition, isn't it annoying?..."</p>
<p>The younger brother hurriedly said, "That's right, that's right! If you have a bowel movement at that time, it is indeed very annoying."</p>
<p>The older brother said, "So we should schedule our daily bowel movements; but scheduling them after getting up in the morning is the most appropriate. Because after having a bowel movement in the morning, you don't have to worry about it all day, whether you're eating, in class... And it's even more convenient for traveling. If you suddenly have to have a bowel movement halfway when you're traveling and can't find a toilet, isn't that a very painful thing?"</p>
<p>After the older brother finished his bowel movement, the younger brother also went to have a bowel movement. The younger brother strained his face red and asked loudly, "Brother! I can't pee at all, what's the reason?"</p>
<p>The older brother: "This is because you don't usually have a bowel movement at this time. Don't be impatient now, sit for a while longer, you can pee out a little. In the future, as long as you have a bowel movement at this time every day, it will become a habit."</p>

<h3 id="e215">Wang'er on Children's Day <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Wang'er was the son of a poor father. His father had a food stall in front of the Rende Elementary School. Children from poor families, even if they are of school age, do not have the right to receive education. Not only do they not have the right to receive education, but they also have the obligation to help their fathers produce. Wang'er's father was very poor, so naturally he was no exception, so he also wore a tray on his chest every day, with a piece of paper pasted on the tray, and cheap food hidden under the paper, following his father, near the Rende Elementary School, luring elementary school students to play the trick of "hitting the jackpot with a copper coin."</p>
<p>That day happened to be April 4th, early in the morning, he followed his father to the front of Rende Elementary School as usual. But that day, he saw that the situation in Rende Elementary School was a bit special. People were so busy going in and out of Rende Elementary School, and those elementary school students were also particularly happy, but there were particularly few people who came to him to hit the jackpot. He felt surprised, so he pulled a familiar elementary school student and asked him what the school was doing today. The child said the three words "Children's Day" and jumped to school again. Then, the school emitted beautiful piano music, melodious singing, applause, and laughter.</p>
<p>Half a day passed like this, and the father and son had not made three hundred cash. In the afternoon, the school led the entire school's students to play in the suburbs. Obviously, there was no hope of doing business in the afternoon. But the hunger in his stomach made Wang'er's father see stars, so he vented his anger on Wang'er for no reason, beating Wang'er's face blue. Wang'er cried while thinking in his stomach: "Children's Day? What is called Children's Day? Is Children's Day the day I should be beaten?"—He didn't know what the meaning of Children's Day was, but he cursed Children's Day like crazy.</p>

<p>(1) I am Little Pan Gu, I am not afraid of hardship. I want to open up a new world, look at the double axe in my hand.</p>
<p>(2) I am Little Sun Wen, I have the spirit of revolution. I want to overthrow imperialism, like a ball rolling.</p>

<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>When we talk about "money," we think of silver dollars with Sun Yat-sen's image on them, copper coins with national flags, and colorful banknotes. In fact, there are many kinds of "money" in the world. If we look at this picture, we will understand how many strange kinds of money there are in the world.</p>
<p>In very ancient times, there were no copper coins or banknotes like today. If you wanted to say that this family was rich, you would say, "He has how many livestock, how many slaves." In this way, livestock and slaves were the "money" of that time. Later, the exchange of goods between people (such as exchanging rice for cloth) became busier and busier, and it was necessary to determine something as a standard for exchanging goods with each other. Therefore, leather, shells, iron bars, ivory, tea cakes, and salt blocks were used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Even in modern times, in several civilized countries, certain things are sometimes used as "money." For example, Canada uses beaver pelts, Newfoundland uses dried fish, Germany uses soup cubes, and Virginia uses tobacco. For example, in 1914, in Harrison, USA, eggs were once used. People had to hold eggs and hand them to the ticket counter to buy tickets to the cinema.</p>

<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>March 12, Tuesday.</p>
<p>There have been many children coming to school these past few days, and even desks are lacking. It is said that this is the result of the school implementing compulsory education. All children aged six to thirteen must receive compulsory education. That is, they are only considered to have completed their educational obligations after graduating from the fourth grade of primary school. If children of school age do not attend school, the school will ask the police to enforce it.</p>
<p>This is the case in all countries: however, the length of compulsory education varies from country to country. England has nine years, France has seven years, Germany has eight years, Belgium has eight years, Italy has nine years, Switzerland has nine years, Sweden has seven years, the United States has nine years, and Japan has six years: they have been very successful in their implementation, so the people are very intelligent. Although China has set compulsory education at four years, it has not been universally implemented. Our principal is a very enthusiastic educator, who has specifically formulated compulsory education implementation measures, obtained the permission of the county government, and announced them to the public; if any children do not study, they will be punished. Therefore, there are extremely many children coming to our school these days.</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m., the tenth anniversary of the death of the Premier was held, and the school's national flag was only raised to half-mast. Thinking about it, a great man who saved China and the world has been dead for ten years: time is so fast, and the pain only intensifies! Many people often take "inheriting the legacy" as a catchphrase: what is the reality of the performance now?—The country is about to perish—</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>I ran as fast as I could, not stopping until evening, when I sat down to rest for a while, ate some food I had brought with me, and then set off again. When my food ran out, I ate coconuts, because coconuts can be used as both food and drink. But on the eighth day, I saw the sea. I saw many people, like me, _______________ because there was a strong fragrance that was produced near the coast.</p>
<p>When these people saw me, they left their work and came up to talk to me. I was happy to hear them speak in my native dialect, which let me know that I was with friends.</p>
<p>I told them about the shipwreck and my life with the black people, and they were all delighted to see me. They thought it was very fortunate that I was able to escape from the hands of those black people.</p>
<p>Finally, we all boarded a ship carrying a large batch of spices and set sail, arriving on time at the place where these new friends of mine had originally departed. They took me to see their king, and I told him all kinds of adventures. Immediately, he ordered the courtiers to take care of me and give me everything I needed.</p>
<p>I had a very happy time in this place. Soon I held a very high position in the dynasty. In short, no one was luckier than me, and everyone in the court and the town asked to be my friend.</p>
<p>Before long, everyone no longer regarded me as someone from another place, but as someone from their hometown.</p>
<p>One thing that surprised me very much was that when a person went out on horseback, I saw that he was riding on the bare back of the horse, without reins or stirrups. I went to the king to ask him why this was so.</p>
<p>I told him about the things we used in Baghdad. He didn't know what I meant, because he had never heard of the things I was talking about.</p>
<p>So I got someone to make a saddle for the horse's back, and also made stirrups to hang on both sides of the horse, and I also made a horse's bit and reins, and gave them all to the king.</p>
<p>The king ordered us to put them on a horse, then jumped on the horse and sat on the saddle, holding the reins.</p>
<p>He immediately saw their effectiveness. He was very happy to have these things, and gave me a large number of gifts. I made more of these things for the local dignitaries, and the gifts they gave me soon made me even richer.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Traveling in Hangzhou <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>The good thing about spring is the mild climate. It is green all over the fields. Everything is full of vitality and interest.</p>
<p>In the large glass windows of Shanghai department stores, if you see green and yellow window decorations, you will know that the so-called "Foreign Qingming" is approaching. Especially in Sullivan's window, with the American flag and Washington's portrait hanging, and many Qingming eggs, you will feel that this is a symbol of the arrival of spring. You should go out to relax.</p>
<p>People in Shanghai will think of traveling when they mention spring. They will also think of Hangzhou. Hangzhou seems to be the only destination for Shanghai people to travel. Going to Hangzhou, once a year, Hangzhou is never tiring. Here, I will write about the scenery of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>In recent years, Hangzhou has indeed made progress. The asphalt road allows you to sit in the car smoothly to the hotel. There are many standard clocks on the road. There are also urban red and green advertisements on the clock pillars. When each train arrives at the city station, crossing the overpass, crowding out of the gate, you will hear the hustle and bustle of hotel greeters. Of course, going to Shanghai, Beijing, or any big city, there are these greeting sounds. But when you arrive at the city station and hear the high and long greetings, you will obviously feel that you have arrived in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>In fact, when you arrive in Hangzhou, in West Lake, on the road, in the park, you will meet familiar people you often see in Shanghai. Or, you may meet friends in Shanghai that you can't often see, and you will meet with a smile. Meeting old friends in a foreign land.</p>
<p>In spring, everything in Hangzhou is expensive. The small boats floating on the lake, in the hot summer and cold winter, the daily cost is only one yuan. Now in spring, unless you spend four or five yuan, you will not be able to enjoy yourself on the lake. At noon, when the boat is rocked to the inner West Lake, the boatman will surely eagerly persuade you to have lunch at Lou Wai Lou. When you have eaten your fill of West Lake vinegar fish and stir-fried chicken, the boatman downstairs will also be full of wine and food, and look forward to it in high spirits. Of course, you have unknowingly paid for the boatman's meals. In addition, the boatman is very good at catering to your psychology. He will say what you want to say. He will very respectfully pin up the things you bought everywhere. But you must be careful. When the day's hard work is over, you should pay more tips for the wine. Otherwise, the face at parting is very ugly.</p>
<p>Speaking of Hangzhou's hotels, there are many. The hotels in the inner West Lake area have good Lounges, good rooms and bathrooms, which are specially for high-class foreigners and Chinese to live in. If you are financially well-off, why not step into these magnificent hotels and enjoy a few days of leisure. Originally, traveling is a luxurious thing. Why bother yourself and save everywhere, and find your own suffering in traveling. I think the most wonderful place in these high-class hotels is the very long corridor. When you wake up in the morning or are about to sleep, lying on the soft satin sofa, smoking a cigarette and drinking strong tea, the surrounding mountain scenery and sparkling water will envelop your whole mind. At this moment, you will think of the Western Hills of Beijing, Florence of Italy, and Interlaken of Switzerland. You will also think of all the romantic things in your life.</p>
<p>As for the hotels in the Hubin area, I will also report on them. The good thing about Hubin is that it is convenient for transportation and food. If you are not a person who likes loneliness, you can go to Hubin for a walk at any time at midnight or in the early morning. The hotels in Hubin are not bad either. Although the architecture is not as magnificent as the high-class hotels in the inner West Lake, it can still make you live happily. The white bed curtains and soft couches will surely make you sleep soundly after a day of travel.</p>
<p>The hotels in spring are quiet during the day. These travelers go out in the morning and come back at dusk. So the hotels are always very lonely except in the morning and evening. Because the waiters have nothing to do, they always sleep soundly in the afternoon. Spring is originally intoxicating. Under the warm sun, on the terrace in the rocking chair, lying the fat waiter, it can be said to be extremely happy.</p>
<p>The most devout is a group of incense-burning guests. They carry yellow bags of "Pilgrimage to the Mountains to Offer Incense". Whether it is Yuquan, Taoguang, or North Peak, they will move forward step by step. Who can know the bright and happy future.</p>
<p>In fact, the joy of traveling is not in how much the road is rushed, but in the spiritual pleasure. For example, if you get up in the morning and take a walk on Su Causeway, there are weeping willows and singing birds. You can take a walk. You can sit on a chair. You don't have to worry about everything. Undoubtedly, everything in this great nature is in your territory. Or you can muster up the courage and run all the way up North Peak. Qiantang River suddenly appears in front of you. You can know why Qiantang River is also called Zhi River. Because you can only see the shape of the river when you look at Qiantang River from North Peak. It is indeed a "之" character.</p>
<p>In short, Hangzhou is a place that you will never tire of going to. In this short article, I only write about the outline of Hangzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Tour of the Fuchun River <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The steamboat departs from Nanxing Bridge. In less than half an hour, you will enter the well-known Fuchun River. You will immediately feel the clear mountains and waters, completely free of vulgarity. The scenery along the river is enough to please the eye. After about three hours, you will arrive at Tonglu. Tongjun Mountain stands in the middle of the river. On top of it is Tongjun Temple, which is said to be the place where a person from the Yellow Emperor's time gathered herbs. He could distinguish the properties of herbs and transformed beside a paulownia tree, hence the name Tongjun. After a while, you can reach Qililong. Yan Ziling's Fishing Platform is at the entrance of the Long. To the west, there is another platform, with a pavilion built on it, where Mr. Xie Gaoyu cried bitterly. Climbing the platform and looking down, the streams are deep and the abyss makes one's hair stand on end. It is already more than a hundred feet above the water. Xie Tingjian has a stele with the inscription "Eternal Pure Breeze." In Yan's ancestral hall, there is a couplet: "The fishing platform on the rock is high, let the whales stir up the waves in the vast sea, managing the fishing line, uniquely observing the world situation. The cloud path is close to the small boat, carrying a lone crane, indulging in the mountains and rivers, arranging poetry and wine, listening to the sound of the rapids from Qili." Beside the ancestral hall is the Guest Star Tower, where the deities of Xie Gaoyu and Su Dongpo are enshrined. In the tower, there is a couplet: "The Great Han for thousands of years, Mr. Yan alone." Also referring to Mr. Yan, the praise is extremely appropriate. At this point, it makes people recall the noble character and integrity of the two gentlemen, and deeply reflect on the competition for fame and profit. The scenery is outstanding, and visitors often linger and forget to return.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou branch of our company has organized a Fuchun River tour group. Those who wish to participate, please register at the Shanghai General Office on Sichuan Road.</p>

<p>— Yang Haoran</p>
<p>On the morning of the 29th, at 7:30 AM, I drove to the Ningbo-Fenghua Road station and took the 8:30 AM bus to Xikou. The fare was only 87 cents. (A small chartered car costs 11 yuan, which can go directly to the mountain pavilion). In about an hour, I reached my destination (Xikou). Then I walked to Wuling School. The school was founded by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. The architecture is magnificent and can be called a model elementary school. After visiting, I went to Wenchang Pavilion (one of Chiang's residences). I was stopped by the guards, who said that I needed a permit from the principal of Wuling School to be allowed to enter and visit. So I turned to Chiang's ancestral hall, a place to honor ancestors and pursue the past, which made people feel respectful. After a week of inspection, it was already 11:00 AM. So I hired a sedan chair to go up the mountain. About five li to Baiyan (Chiang's mother's tomb), I went down and up the mountain. The guards asked if I had come to prepare a hotel here, and they were very polite. They led me from the gate to Chiang's mother's tomb, about three li. On both sides, pine and cypress trees were towering and green, and bamboo forests were forming. The middle was gravel. The road was very steep, and it was very difficult to walk straight up. Especially since I was wearing leather shoes, there was a danger of jumping every step. After walking about two li, I saw a few bungalows. An old woman greeted and led me to the inner room. There was an image of Chiang's mother in the room, with only two vases of flowers next to it. There was nothing else. In the next room, there were all inscriptions, such as Sun Yat-sen, Tan Yankai, and other relics, as well as sacrificial texts written by other party and state leaders Yu Youren, Dai Jitao, etc., displayed all over the wall. It can be said that it was a feast for the eyes to admire the calligraphy of many party and state elders. After the tour, I asked the old woman where Chiang's mother's tomb was. I only knew that it was still one li up the mountain. At this time, I was suddenly lost, thinking that since I came with great interest, how could I return halfway? So I still mustered up my courage to go up the mountain. When I reached the top of the mountain, I felt very tired. I turned to the tomb. The architecture was extremely ordinary. Only the tombstone was written by Sun Yat-sen. After hesitating for a while, I hurried down the mountain and moved forward. Not five li, I arrived at the mountain pavilion. The pavilion was built with funds from Mr. Du Yuesheng. There are monks from Xuebao Temple here to entertain tourists. It was already 1:00 PM. I was hungry, so I continued to move forward. About five li, all uphill, passed through the Han Hua Yushu Pavilion. The hostel built by our company was already in sight. I went to Xueshi Temple to fill my stomach first, and then went to the hostel with Dong (the foreman of the construction factory building the hostel) to inspect the interior. After the tour, I went to Miaogao Terrace.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, after a light breakfast, I went with Mr. Dong and others to Yintan. From Shangxue Road, I passed through Xikan to visit the Peasant Reading Center. After passing Eighteen Bends, I climbed Xiefeng. About three li, I reached Fengci Temple. I turned back to the road to Yintan and forked to Yintan Temple. There were also dozens of peasant children reading books inside the temple. After leaving the temple and crossing a stone bridge, I arrived at Shangyintan. Then I went to Qianzhang Cliff and looked up at Yizhi Bridge (the waterfall viewing bridge). There was a pavilion next to it. The architecture was very elaborate, but no one lived there. It looked like it was dilapidated. Leaning on the bridge and looking up at the Qianzhang Cliff waterfall, the shape and sound were magnificent and unparalleled. After crossing the bridge and following the road under the pavilion, I returned to the temple via the Yushu Pavilion. It was already 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 1st, I visited Xuedou Temple. The temple is one of the Ten Zen Temples and has a magnificent architecture. The temple is divided into three buildings. At the entrance, there are five characters "The First Mountain of Siming" written by Chiang Kai-shek himself, as well as two ginkgo trees. Now I append a tourist itinerary for your reference.</p>
<p>Day 1: Take a bus to Xikou at 7:00 or 8:00 AM. (Soon it will be possible to go directly to the mountain, but a small chartered car can already go directly). Visit Wuling School, Wuling Farm, Wenchang Pavilion, and Chiang's ancestral hall.</p>
<p>(You must first obtain a permit from the principal of Wuling School). Then take the sedan chair to Baiyan to visit Chiang's mother's tomb. (The sedan chair fee from Xikou to our hostel is $1.20). Then pass through the Inshan Han Hua Yushu Pavilion to our hostel for lunch. In the afternoon, visit Feixue Pavilion, see the Qianzhang Cliff Waterfall and Miaogao Terrace.</p>
<p>Day 2: After breakfast, take the sedan chair from Shangxue Road through Xikan. Visit the Xuebao Peasant Reading Center. Then visit Fengci Temple. Return to the hostel for lunch. In the afternoon, visit Shangyintan and Xiayintan. Then turn to Qianzhang Cliff and look down at the waterfall from Guanpu Bridge, and return to the hostel for dinner.</p>
<p>Day 3: Visit Xuedou Temple, have lunch, and then depart from the hostel at 12:30 PM. Arrive at Xikou to catch the 2:00 or 3:00 o'clock bus back to Ningbo, and you can still catch the boat to Shanghai.</p>

<p>I love the cinnabar spring. Neither cool nor hot. There is sulfur and mercury below.</p>
<p>Spraying like pearls. Dug into a square pool. The water is fragrant and clean.</p>
<p>Spring rain does not add flow. Winter day does not freeze snow. There is a cold spring.</p>
<p>A line leaking from a stone cave. Trickling into the pool, the temperature is excellent.</p>
<p>Huaqing does not have this wonder. Tangshan is also inferior. Bathers are increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Wide acceptance regardless of rank. Makes the body clean. Further makes the spirit happy.</p>
<p>Magistrate Liu explored the matter. A new pool was dug next to the stone. Magistrate Jin warned the craftsmen.</p>
<p>Busily patching and repairing. Clear the bush and place the platform pavilion. Repair the road to remove the defects.</p>
<p>Climb the tower above the pool at night. The mountain is high and the moon is bright. Peach blossoms and purple clouds.</p>
<p>Enjoy the secluded view.</p>

<h3 id="e231">A Review of Singleness <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Wen</p>
<p>In today's society, there are many women who have received secondary or even higher education, who are blindly advocating or practicing singleness. Although this non-doctrine doctrine does not seem to have aroused the discussion of great scholars in women's issues, its importance is by no means diminished by this. Before we discuss the issue of singleness, it may be helpful to briefly describe its origin. The trend of singleness is not limited to women alone, but men also have this custom. Undoubtedly, its most prosperous era was when religious power was at its strongest and divine power was above all else. Because at that time, people believed that only the power of God was the greatest; believing in God would not only allow them to enter heaven after death, but also increase their happiness in their current lives through the protection of God. Thus, many people sacrificed the happiness of their lives, suppressed their desires, remained unmarried, and devoted themselves to serving God; or limited themselves to embracing singleness for a certain period. The most common example is the monks and nuns in Buddhism, followed by priests in ancient Egypt and Greece, the vestal virgins in Rome, and the Saigu in the Grand Shrine of Ise in Japan; in addition, ascetics in the Brahmin clan and a sect in Christianity all embrace singleness. This kind of singleness sacrificed for God, this immoral ascetic behavior, only shows the low level of human knowledge in that era, and has no other significance.</p>
<p>Since the existence of mankind, there has been the matter of male and female intercourse; of course, this sexual desire is innate. We Chinese have an old saying that food and sex are human nature. Havelock Ellis also said: old maids and ascetic youths are easily spotted in any country, in any region. The force of suppressed natural impulses is dangerous evidence. Female nymphomania and various hysterias are mostly caused by this. From this, it can be seen that obstructing the impulse of sexual desire is an abnormal act that violates physiology and nature. Therefore, in the eleventh century, many people in Europe who had to embrace asceticism were influenced by the licentious customs of Rome, and used various unreasonable methods to satisfy their desires. Therefore, at that time, the life in many monasteries and temples that were called ascetic was more romantic than the life in brothels. At the same time, during the Crusades, many women organized women's armies to be comforters for soldiers on the battlefield due to the difficulty of getting married. These old facts powerfully prove that human beings, whether male or female, need the opposite sex equally. Therefore, from the temporary pairing marriage in ancient times to today's free love, although the system has undergone many changes, marriage is still a major issue, and this is the reason.</p>
<p>Rousseau once said in his book Emile: The duty of women is to assist us men, comfort us men, gain the love and affection of men, and be comforters for men, so that men can easily and happily walk the path of life. Whether this statement is appropriate, we will not say for the time being; however, the importance of the spiritual needs of both sexes can be seen from this. Kant expressed this idea most thoroughly. He said: Men and women can only become complete people when they are combined. The healthy development of mankind is based on the proper combination of the two sexes. The satisfaction of sexual desire is an essential element for the physical and mental health of men and women. As for Havelock Ellis's opinion, he believes that human beings are not animals, and physical harmony is not enough to satisfy their higher desires. Therefore, there must be spiritual harmony and attraction. If there is no spirit, sexual intercourse will only become a mechanical and immoral act. We no longer need to quote other people's words, it is enough to prove that singleness runs counter to human spiritual harmony and excitement. At the same time, we can make further discussions here. The reason why women are currently advocating singleness is of course not for the sake of God; however, they think that marriage is an accompanying event that increases spiritual pain, especially for women who are engaged in occupations, they regard marriage as a waste in life, and even observe various hardships from actual life, so they regard marriage as a dangerous road. In fact, this kind of observation is enough to show their short-sightedness, because based on the principle of marriage, marriage is not a painful thing; in other words, it is an abnormal phenomenon to increase pain and hinder the progress of career for the sake of marriage. In theory, under the mutual encouragement and help between the two sexes, there should be extra progress for his or her career. Therefore, from the perspective of this spiritual need, advocating singleness is simply heading for self-destruction.</p>
<p>The soundness of a nation and the strength of a country, although not a simple issue, are inseparable from the fundamental element of the people. Therefore, although countries are suffering from depression and unemployment, governments are still encouraging production. Especially in China, due to years of war, years of natural disasters, and the death of people due to ignorance of hygiene, the mortality rate is higher than in all other countries. If we advocate the so-called singleness at this time, it will not only fail to make the country and nation strong, but also be an active national suicide policy. Therefore, from the standpoint of the country, this kind of singleness is definitely not needed.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Women of the Land of Abundance <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence</p>
<p>The so-called cultural center of the "Land of Abundance" is Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province. All the foreign goods enjoyed by modern Shanghai women are available in the department stores of Chengdu, catering to the needs of modern Chengdu women. Moreover, Shanghai women's modern attire and dating styles are also流行 (popluar) in all aspects of Chengdu women's lives along with various commodities and film dramas. It is no wonder that many Sichuan people call it "Little Shanghai." Anyone who has lived in Sichuan must admit that many women from various counties envy the material culture and open-mindedness enjoyed by Chengdu women. However, there is another matter that we cannot fail to mention: outside the urban area of Chengdu, alongside any of the thoroughfares that connect with the countryside, stand countless "Martyr Women's Monuments" or "Filial Piety Memorial Arches." These feudal relics have not been eliminated by the traffic of automobiles on the roads. On the contrary, they are still revered by tens of thousands of women. Not only rural women, but also women from Chengdu and other cities, constantly visit these "Martyr Women's Monuments" or "Filial Piety Memorial Arches" to offer incense. From these two situations, it is clear that the lives of Chengdu women are arranged between two extremes: the extremely new and the extremely old. The following is a detailed account, divided into sections, for the reference of those who study social issues.</p>
<p>(I) Their Lives and Status in the Family</p>
<p>(A) Urban Housewives</p>
<p>The city's women can be roughly divided into three categories:</p>
<p>The first category is the women of wealthy families. This includes the wives and daughters of military officers and important officials, the mistresses of big businessmen, and the women of large landowners. They enjoy material civilization in great abundance: their use of servants and maids is quite in the style of the feudal aristocracy. Like those undisciplined warlords, they often use their power to dominate others, either running over pedestrians on the road in their private cars or fighting for seats with others in public entertainment venues.</p>
<p>The second category is the housewives of middle-class merchants, salaried professionals, and small landlords. Although their economic power is not as great as that of wealthy families, sufficient for their own extravagant waste, their family finances are constantly in a precarious state. Under the pressure of snobbery, they appear even more eager to flaunt their status. Therefore, most women from these middle-class families like to keep slaves and maids (called "丫頭" (丫頭) in Chengdu). Various kinds of flattering superiors and condescending to inferiors are prominent in them. The ability to calculate for themselves and glib talk can be said to be their special strengths.</p>
<p>The third category is the housewives of poorer or manual labor families. Their husbands are mostly coolies or peddlers. In order to help support their families, they spend most of</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>their time washing clothes, sewing, changing weft threads for silk weaving workshops, sewing sock openings for sock factories, and doing various similar jobs for others. They have relatively independent living skills. Unfortunately, even with year-round hard work, it is difficult for them to afford their children even a basic education. But, strangely enough, precisely because they have experienced more of the ways of the world in their lives, they are particularly envious of the enjoyment and boasting of women from wealthy and middle-class families.</p>
<p>(B) Rural Housewives</p>
<p>As for rural housewives, they can also be divided into three categories:</p>
<p>The first category is the women of wealthy gentry families. Although they are purely landlords or grain households, due to the influence of various warlords, local bullies, and evil gentry, they also tend to follow the trend of the times. On the one hand, they try to gloss over their family's economic affluence, and on the other hand, they put on the airs of aristocratic ladies. This can be clearly seen in their interactions with ordinary people in the countryside, or in their attire, showing their arrogance and extravagance. Especially during festivals when "喜神會" (喜神會) are held in small towns under their control, or when "城隍" (城隍) and "關聖人" (關聖人) parades are organized, their power can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>The second category is the housewives of middle peasants or tenant farmers. These are the typical simple rural women. In addition to taking care of all the household chores, such as clothing, food, and shelter, they also have to raise young children. During the busy farming season, they also have to go to the fields, sinking their bound feet into the muddy paddies. The result of their hard work may barely sustain their livelihood, but when heavy taxes and levies make their family situation difficult, they often lament that they have suffered their entire lives, without even enjoying the material life of being a maid or wet nurse in the city.</p>
<p>The third category is the housewives who own only two or three acres of land or who are purely hired laborers or wet nurses. Their husbands are usually engaged in farming, either for others or for themselves, without fixed hours. In their spare time, they engage in small-scale mobile businesses with a capital of one or two dollars, earning a small income by transporting vegetables, fruits, coal, and other goods. However, this meager income is not enough to cover household expenses; therefore, most of them are forced to go out to work as maids.</p>
<p>(II) Women Going to School</p>
<p>Since the "May Fourth Movement" and the advocacy of "Women Must Receive Education" became popular throughout the country, Chengdu was the first to open girls' classes in various primary, middle, universities, and vocational schools. Many schools had already converted to co-educational classes several years ago. As for the number of students in women's normal schools or women's schools, it seems to be even more enthusiastic than in general men's schools. Up to now, it can be said that the appearance of women's education in Chengdu is quite impressive.</p>
<p>So, how much real knowledge do they actually learn in school? Considering the financial difficulties of Chengdu's education and the self-deception of the general faculty and staff due to the lack of job security, the average female student certainly does not receive adequate education (not the "合格" (合格) graded by the teachers, but the "合格" (合格) of the ordinary required level). On average, each semester is only twelve or thirteen weeks, at most sixteen or seventeen weeks, and rarely twenty weeks of instruction; there are also holidays and even times when classes are suspended due to various disturbances. Therefore, in terms of knowledge cultivation, eight or nine out of ten of them are very deficient.</p>
<p>What about moral education? Many schools are indeed stricter in their management, but many schools do not even do the bare minimum. We have encountered poor female students working as prostitutes and unexpectedly meeting their "夫子大人" (夫子大人) at a lavish banquet of drinking and flower wine. At that time, the students recognized the teacher, but the teacher did not recognize the student? This is naturally the result of the imperfection of the educational institutions. However, at the same time, we should mention the arrogant and extravagant power of many aristocratic young ladies in the school, which often guarantees their habit of "校外自由" (校外自由) outside of school; this habit has long made it impossible for the faculty and staff to control them. They flaunt their power with the bodyguards and guards raised by their family members and friends. Faculty and staff often have no choice but to turn a blind eye to avoid disputes outside the school.</p>
<p>Although the number of aristocratic women and poor prostitute-like female students mentioned above is not large in the school, their level of modernness and their arrogant and vain temperaments undoubtedly play a leading role in the school. Therefore, the absolute majority of pure women are unknowingly affected. In such an environment, I have seen modern female students tell their classmates that their parents who came from the countryside to Chengdu schools to send her money are her "傭僕" (傭僕) (servants). The reason is probably because their parents are dressed too simply! There are many interesting anecdotes similar to this strange situation. Of course, we should know that many female students are still tightly controlled by the subconsciousness of old families, but the so-called progress, openness, modernness…etc. tendencies are, after all, more powerfully attracting them in school. Therefore, school education has ultimately failed to show them a true path for new women.</p>
<p>(III) Women Seeking Careers</p>
<p>In recent years, many sock factories or sewing companies have been established in Chengdu. Many small entrepreneurs have spent a lot of effort studying how to promote industry and calling on women to participate in production. As a result, many women are also enthusiastically wanting to acquire a "一技之長" (一技之長) (skill) to seek independent living or to transform their families. Sure enough, many women have indeed learned skills very well, but unfortunately, the announcement of "公司關門" (公司關門) (company closure) was announced in a short moment.</p>
<p>Many women, after graduating from the factory, mostly cannot find normal work. Some return to various counties to purchase a dozen machines to engage in their own business, but eight or nine out of ten fail. Because those ten-yarn (local cotton yarn) and non-electric dyed thread socks or silk stockings are not as cheap and good as Shanghai or imported products. Even if there are people who occasionally have access to business, they cannot but roll up their flags and rest due to the impact of donations and taxes and wars. Moreover, most of the sock-making machines they are currently using in Chengdu are still old machines from Shanghai and foreign countries several years ago. Because those small entrepreneurs, seeing the business slump, "見風轉柁" (見風轉柁) (turned with the wind) and turned the factory into a side business, and held so-called vocational schools, on the one hand, they could collect a large amount of tuition fees, and at the same time, they had to sell old machines. Machines that cost twenty or thirty yuan in Shanghai, they forced the female students who went to the factory to learn to order one each. The price is set at around one hundred yuan. Little do they know that once they move them home and actually use them, they find that they are scrap iron.</p>
<p>In Chengdu, in addition to this large number of professional women who are displaced, there are also several obstetrics schools. However, their level of immaturity is not much different from the unlicensed obstetrics hospitals in Shanghai that recklessly recruit nurses and take advantage of them to obtain hundred-yuan deposits.</p>
<p>The "花瓶" (花瓶) (decorative) system of employing women in shops and offices has not yet been pioneered. The employment of female waitresses cannot be found in the whole city.</p>
<p>As for those professional women who make a living by selling their bodies, on the surface, it seems that they are not as powerful as the prostitutes in Beijing and Shanghai. However, the two famous areas of "興化街" (興化街) and "五台山" (五台山) are still openly paying flower donations to the authorities. In addition, there are many private prostitutes who dress up as female students or aunts and young ladies, attracting bees and butterflies everywhere. Although their business is not bad, their tragic lives are imaginable!</p>
<p>(IV) Their Love and Marriage</p>
<p>People in Chengdu have long considered the hypocrisy of "自由戀愛" (自由戀愛) (free love) to be terrible. Therefore, many parents still adopt the method of "父母之命媒妁之言" (父母之命媒妁之言) (parents' orders and matchmakers' words) for their children's marriages. Generally, more enlightened parents usually look for families that are well-matched, first discuss the marriage contract without fixing it, and try to let their children meet once or twice. As long as they do not have major dissatisfaction with each other, they can get engaged under the "勢利相投" (勢利相投) (common interests). Under this passive "enlightened" method, men usually have not been in contact with women, and women do not seem to have any fixed prejudices. Therefore, in this semi-free and semi-constrained marriage relationship, it is not combined by love, nor by academic thoughts, nor by the country and society—it is only that most declining families pursue power and profit through their children's marriage problems. As a result of this situation, seven or eight out of ten are depressed and decadent, and two or three out of ten are preparing to publish divorce notices in the newspaper shortly after marriage. Therefore, to put it bluntly, women in Chengdu rarely have true love at all. In fact, many women are destroyed and sacrificed by feudal forces under the false names of freedom or love.</p>
<p>Many women from poor families see the power relations in Chengdu very clearly. Many parents are determined not to marry their daughters unless they are military officers. Therefore, even lower-ranking officers such as platoon leaders or adjutants can easily find women to date or marry. But the most unfortunate women are precisely them. In most cases, the officers eventually bury them within the ranks of private prostitutes.</p>
<p>In addition, many women from well-off families, after marrying hard-working craftsmen or self-cultivating farmers, often have countless happy and truly loving couples because of everyone's hard work and cooperation in life. This is the only remaining fruit of Chengdu's petty-bourgeois economy and free rural areas. They live a beautiful and leisurely life in the "Land of Abundance", and even their personalities become particularly peaceful and generous. What a pity is that the number of such women who combine love and life is gradually decreasing and disappearing very quickly.</p>
<p>Celebrity Interview</p>
<h3 id="e233">Interview with Sculptor Jiang Xiaoqian <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Ruoyu</p>
<p>Having visited the Shanghai Art Preview Exhibition, which showcased such a rich collection of ancient bronze and jade carvings, I couldn't help but think of several modern artists engaged in carving.</p>
<p>What we were able to see in this preview was only a fraction of all the "antiques," yet it was enough to spend half a day appreciating them. The sheer quantity was astonishing. After seeing the vast amount of "antiques" left behind by the hard work of previous artists, it is inevitable that we have high expectations for modern carving artists. However, if we look back at the works achieved by modern carving artists, it is questionable whether their artistic value can be compared with "antiques." In terms of quantity, it is indeed a little disheartening. From this, we can imagine that the efforts and hard work of previous artists in art are indeed worthy of emulation by those who engage in art later on.</p>
<p>Because I am more easily interested in the art of carving, I seemed to be not fully satisfied after visiting the art preview. So, we found an acquaintance to introduce us, and then ran to Hongqiao Road to visit the famous modern sculptor Mr. Jiang Xiaoqian, because I had long heard that his home has many carvings and modern "antiques" (?).</p>
<p>When we arrived there, it was already about four o'clock in the afternoon, and the weather was so dark and about to rain; therefore, at the moment we met, Mr. Sun hurriedly explained the purpose of our visit on my behalf.</p>
<p>Before meeting Mr. Jiang, I had already sketched such an outline of his appearance in my mind: a fair face, long hair, wearing a suit, and often interspersing one or two English or French sentences when speaking. However, when Mr. Sun introduced me, I was suddenly surprised. It turned out that his attitude and face were exactly the same as Mr. Li Shizeng, the current member of the Central Committee. The sleeves of a crimson gown were already a little furry and "拖鬚擺柳" (拖鬚擺柳) (trailing like willow branches); he wore a pair of cloth shoes, showing a very mature and prudent demeanor when walking.</p>
<p>After listening to Mr. Sun's introduction, he happily led us to sit down in a delicate guest room: after some greetings, I found a question and started the interview.</p>
<p>"Mr. Jiang probably went to visit the art preview recently held in Shanghai?" This question is not very practical, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>"I wanted to see it, but I haven't had time these two days. You must have visited it?" He smiled.</p>
<p>"I did see it, but it's like 'Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden,' I don't understand anything! If Mr. Jiang went to take a look, he could give an artistic evaluation of the many ancient carvings." I said humbly.</p>
<p>"I dare not make a light criticism." He shook his head slightly, and then said: "But after seeing it, maybe there are many things worth learning from; I think a person engaged in art is like a person studying literature, he must humbly accept the legacy of his predecessors. The success of previous artists in skills does make us later 'artisans' a little '望塵莫及' (望塵莫及) (unable to catch up). Now, just take myself as an example, as a person engaged in carving for nearly twenty years, I have always dared not consider any of my works to be successful. From this, you can imagine that carving art is indeed not an easy job to do well." He frowned, showing a dissatisfied depression.</p>
<p>"In what year did Mr. Jiang's carving career begin?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It's a long story," he took a puff of cigarette, slowly reminiscing: After a while, he said, "At first, I originally studied portrait painting in Japan. Later, I felt that portrait painting seemed to have many places that could not be expressed as a whole. Even if the painting skills were learned to the point of perfection, it was still impossible to express a person's image as a whole from the paper as much as he wanted. So, after living in Japan for five years, I ran to France to start learning the art of sculpture. I also lived in France for five full years, and finally learned a little bit of what I wanted to learn; however, the reason why I was able to gain some insights into learning sculpture is entirely due to my foundation in learning portrait painting. Because if you study sculpture without the experience of painting, it takes a lot of time, but it is still difficult to achieve success."</p>
<p>"What is Mr. Jiang's first successful work?"</p>
<p>"I dare not say that. I said just now that I don't dare to consider any of the works I have completed to be successful. Moreover, I have now almost formed a state of professional life for carving, and for a work, I am often restricted by the other party due to economic reasons; it seems like a craftsman, although I have a very good performance for a work, the customer's favorite is not necessarily your so-called proud work. If I reluctantly say that there are one or two works that I am satisfied with, then there are only the bronze statue of the late Shanghai yarn tycoon Wu Linshu and the statue of Mr. Ma Xiangbo now, but this is only what I think is satisfactory." He laughed heartily: "Now these two statues are still in the factory over there, you might as well go and take a look."</p>
<p>We came out of that guest room, and he walked in front; after passing through a small garden, not far ahead was a factory building built of white iron, like a "glass shed" in a movie studio, with an area of ​​more than ten acres.</p>
<p>The first room when entering the door is the carving room. Here are dozens of plaster statues that have been turned over to bronze and "泥胎" (泥胎) (clay figures) that are being carved. Each unfinished "泥胎" (泥胎) (clay figure) has a very thick piece of damp cloth wrapped around it, like wounded soldiers with injured skulls in a hospital. Suddenly seeing it, I can't help but feel a slight contraction in my nerves.</p>
<p>He rushed into this carving room, busily instructing the workers to uncover the damp cloths on all the "泥胎" (泥胎) (clay figures) one by one, and told me what these "泥胎" (泥胎) (clay figures) were, how much carving work there was, and after how much time could they be turned into plaster models. He talked so eloquently while pointing and drawing, as if a biology teacher was teaching students</p>
<h3 id="e234">Statue of Mr. Ma Xiangbo <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>

<p>as detailed as if he were giving a lesson.</p>
<p>Finally, I saw the statues of the cotton industry tycoon Wu Linshu and Mr. Ma Xiangbo that he had mentioned.</p>
<p>Wu Linshu's bronze statue is in a sitting pose, which is rare for general commemorative bronze statues. However, the sculpting skill is indeed beyond description.</p>
<p>"Isn't this pose for the bronze statue probably unique in China?" I felt a little strange.</p>
<p>"Yes, general commemorative bronze statues are all three-dimensional, but this one is an exception. However, this is the work I am most satisfied with. When sculpting this bronze statue, I was not restricted in my thinking. However, when I first contacted them, it took a lot of persuasion. In the end, I was willing to compromise on the remuneration before they agreed to let me complete this work according to my ideas." A joyful expression filled his face.</p>
<p>Walking in from the sculpture studio is the bronze casting factory. It is equipped with two large copper smelting furnaces and a rolling machine that can roll up to fifteen tons. In the center of the factory building, three iron chains as thick as fingers are hung high on the beam. Under these iron chains is a copper smelting furnace. After the copper is melted in the furnace, the hot copper is lifted high with iron chains and poured into the copper mold, and then the "bronze body" is successfully made.</p>
<p>This kind of bronze casting equipment doesn't seem that complicated, but it is still unique in modern China for a sculptor to also run a bronze casting factory.</p>
<p>"This method of bronze casting existed in China during the Six Dynasties. However, ancient artists often had an unavoidable bad habit: they preferred to keep a unique skill they learned secret until they died, rather than passing it on. Therefore, this method of bronze casting gradually became unknown. Now that we want to use it, we still have to run to foreign countries to ask for help! After I returned to China, I immediately took on a bronze statue of Mr. Chen Yingshi, with a deadline of ten months. However, I sculpted the 'clay model', but there was no way to solve the bronze casting for a while. Although it would be very convenient to send it to Japan for casting, the time was already very tight. At the same time, I felt that a person engaged in sculpture shouldn't have to ask others for help with their basic skills. As a result, I decided to cast it myself. I temporarily found many coachmen and servants from relatives' homes to be workers and trained them for more than a month. Everyone was very interested in this work and learned some applied techniques. The bronze statue of Mr. Chen Yingshi was completed in this small, makeshift bronze casting factory after nine experiments, and I completed my debut work of bronze casting one month before the deadline. Now, these workers who used to be coachmen have very good bronze casting skills. Recently, almost all of my works, regarding the bronze casting part, have been done automatically by them."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he led us into a very small engraving room. It consisted of two connected rooms: one contained brand-new copper engraving machines and many engraved copper molds of various sizes; the other contained dozens of bronze objects with mottled colors. Judging from the style and the writing on them, most people probably couldn't tell that they were imitations made by modern people.</p>
<p>"When I bought this copper engraving machine, even the foreign company that sold it couldn't tell me how to use it, and I had no experience with this kind of machine. However, in order to achieve an art craft in the future, I had to buy such a machine. As a result, I bought it back. Every day, I and the general workers do this kind of experimental work like apprentices. Now, we have achieved some success and engraved a lot of copper molds and seals." He took out more than a dozen kinds of copper molds and seals from the glass cabinet for me to see.</p>
<p>"It will be easy to establish an art factory in the future," I said.</p>
<p>"You have to keep moving forward like this, but whether it can proceed smoothly still requires a lot of effort!" He said with a very modest expression.</p>
<p>A Week of Travel</p>
<h3 id="e236">A Visit to "Yuan's Tomb" <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>The other day, on the Pinghan Railway, although I had circled around a few times, I had not specifically gotten off the train to sightsee in Zhangde City, which is close to the railway. This time, from Hankou to Beiping, the train happened to pass Zhangde and I happened to run into an old friend, Mr. Pan. He originally worked on the railway but was recently transferred here, so he strongly invited me to get off the train and stay for a few days.</p>
<p>When we got out of the platform, what greeted us was a gust of wind mixed with yellow sand. This welcoming ceremony almost made me unable to open my eyes, and immediately gave me a few bad impressions. When we were about to enter the city (the station is about two li away from the city), the dilapidated city wall in the medieval style aroused my bad feelings again. After entering the city gate, the low houses and dirty streets aged my mood!</p>
<p>The next day was the second day of the third month of the lunar calendar (two days before the Qingming Festival). Mr. Pan invited me to visit "Yuan's Tomb" and Yuan's Garden—the so-called "Yuan's Tomb" is the tomb of Yuan Shikai, which is simply called Yuan's Tomb by the locals. It is about seven or eight li away from Zhangde City, and a rickshaw can go directly there. However, because the road was near, we were willing to walk, so as to take a look at the spring suburbs of the North. However, the spring suburbs of the North are not as beautiful as those in the South, and the weather was gloomy this day, making the wilderness feel even more bleak. The strong wind did not understand the mood of the tourists, and gusts of dust and sand slammed into our faces, so the awareness that the North had no spring became more intense!</p>
<p>When we were about to arrive at Yuan's Tomb, what caught our attention first was the majestic screen wall, which was entirely made of stone. It was about four zhang high and more than ten zhang wide. The "dragon coiling" and "phoenix dancing" carved on it were not very exquisite, and were much inferior to the old carvings. From the screen wall to the tomb is about two li, separated by a small ditch. After crossing the ditch, there is a wide asphalt road (maybe "three-in-one soil") leading directly to the cemetery.</p>
<p>The cemetery covers an area of about twenty mu, and is planted with Chinese arborvitae and dwarf pines all around, which are about to become a forest. In this desert-like plain, the addition of these young pines and cypresses makes it feel green and lovely. The cemetery has four entrances. The first entrance (Langtou Gate) is an open dam paved with rough stones. A pointed pavilion stands in the center, covered with a square tombstone about two zhang high. The tombstone is inlaid with marble. On the front is written "Tomb of President Yuan Shikai" in large letters, with the words "Established on an auspicious day in × month of the eighth year of the Republic of China" next to it. On the other three sides, there is no description of his "deeds." At that time, I was very suspicious as to why the descendants of this great man with a glorious life did not write his great achievements on the tombstone to pass on to future generations. If it were described, there would be titles such as "Minister of Internal Affairs of the Qing Dynasty", "President of the Republic of China", and "Hongxian Emperor". How magnificent this is! Then I realized that there were unspeakable reasons, so I admired the cleverness of his descendants!</p>
<p>The second entrance is also an open dam paved with rough stones. Lions, elephants, tigers, leopards, cattle, and horses stand on both sides. These beasts are all carved from marble, which can be regarded as precious things in this northern land without stone! I know that "lions," "tigers," and "leopards" symbolize power and also have the meaning of "suppressing evil spirits" and "configuring feng shui," while "elephants" symbolize many blessings and longevity, which also has a profound reason. As for the origins and functions of "cattle" and "horses," I am a bit vague. Could it be to indicate that future generations have horses to ride and cattle to till the fields? Or does it imply that this "great man" used the people as cattle and horses during his lifetime? Only "feng shui masters" can answer this. I don't care.</p>
<p>The third entrance is the tomb itself. The tomb platform is more than a zhang high and round, with a diameter of about four zhang. The tomb is more than two zhang high, with a diameter of more than two zhang. In front of the tomb is a flat stele, on which the god of fortune and longevity birds are carved, and the carving is relatively delicate. The railings around the tomb platform are stone pillars strung with iron chains, just like the railings of the residences of wealthy people in big cities. In total, the tomb platform, tombstone, tomb itself, as well as the stone pillars and stairs, are all inlaid with marble. If it weren't for the fact that the years had been a bit long and it had been eroded by wind and rain, it would really be a piece of white, as if walking into a silver world!</p>
<p>Behind the tomb is a wall. Entering through the side door is the fourth entrance. All the houses inside are vermilion doors and pink walls, which are obviously the places where the tomb keepers live. However, we peered into every room, and there was no so-called "filial son guarding the tomb," not even a servant. The houses were full of dust, as if no one had ever been there. The doors were locked tightly, seemingly unopened for a long time.</p>
<p>The cemetery is not guarded, so people can come and go without restraint. On the marble stele and tomb platform, many inscriptions of amateur poets were found, some of which were casual poems, and some ridiculed "Lord Yuan"! As for the pavilions and arches, in short, all places that can shelter from the wind and rain have become resting places for cowherds and hostels for beggars. It is said that every summer, most of the nearby farmers come here to cool off and sleep here at night. The flat stone slabs are naturally more comfortable than their dirty earthen dams. Lord Yuan truly deserves to be a great man of his generation, even the burial place after his death shelters the common people. However, it is said that there are four tombs of Lord Yuan in total (he is from Xiangcheng, and there is always a more magnificent tomb in his hometown. I heard that there is also a tomb in Xinxiang County, but I don't know where his remains are buried). The one left in Zhangde is the least magnificent and occupies the least amount of land. In this case, the other three must be even more spectacular.</p>
<p>Walking out of the cemetery and stepping onto the asphalt road, a cool breeze blew and drizzle sprinkled on our heads. As a result, our original plan to visit Yuan's Garden after visiting Yuan's Tomb failed.</p>

<p>The Chinese language is the most complex and non-unified, which is a major obstacle to the unification and development of Chinese culture. It is no wonder that many insightful people consider it a regrettable thing. Many people with good intentions have been working hard to promote phonetic alphabets, the standard Mandarin, and the collection of dialects, slang, and folk songs. We hope that gradually there will be some achievements, which will not only facilitate the advancement of Chinese culture, but also facilitate travelers and pedestrians a lot.</p>
<p>In general daily language, not only are the pronunciations different in various places, the sentence structures vary with space, and there are even many metaphorical riddles mixed in the conversations, making it incomprehensible to outsiders. People who generally pay attention to language unification have never mentioned the collection of such riddles, but I think it is also necessary to collect them. Riddles in daily language exist in the languages ​​of all provinces and regions, and some riddles are very interesting. It is especially popular in the countryside. Although there are many miswritten characters and mispronounced sounds, it can be seen that the farmers' ability to imagine analogies is not weak. We also need to fully understand the terms they use in order to easily communicate with them and understand what they mean. I don’t know if there are such riddles mixed in languages ​​elsewhere. Now, let’s list some examples of the riddles circulating in our countryside for everyone’s reference. (Some of them are very vulgar and ugly words, but because they are for studying language, it is okay to list them. Readers can ignore their meaning.)</p>
<p>Original Riddle Riddle's Meaning</p>
<p>"Take off your pants and fight a tiger" "Shameless and reckless"</p>
<p>"A crooked-mouthed woman looking in a mirror" "Laughing to your face"</p>
<p>"Take off your pants and spank your butt" "Redundant effort"</p>
<p>"A sparrow jumping into coarse chaff" "Empty joy"</p>
<p>"The City God Temple's fence" "Resisting ghosts" (meaning resisting others in the middle, preventing them from completing good deeds)</p>
<p>"Giving away things and burning incense" "Pretending to be a decent person" (in our countryside, prostitutes are called "giving away things")</p>
<p>"A deaf-mute eating Coptis chinensis" "Unable to express the bitterness"</p>
<p>"Turtles in jars" "Easy to catch"</p>
<p>"The brains of a tailor" "Taken seriously" ("Taken seriously" is a mispronunciation of "taking a needle." Tailors often take needles and put them on their heads when sewing clothes. The needle is easy to stick into the cloth after it is exposed to sweat)</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>"Mama Wang's bound feet" "Smelly and long"</p>
<p>"Light shadows scratching the back" "Doubled flattery" (light shadows are leather figures carved from cowhide, used to sing shadow plays on a screen. The hands of the leather figures are simply carved into two fingers. Doubled flattery means to flatter twice as much)</p>
<p>"Robbers selling baskets" "Concealment" (meaning to conceal their own faces with this)</p>
<p>"Eating porridge with rice water" "Incurably poor" (people are too poor to afford dry rice, so they eat porridge and add rice water, so they are said to be incurably poor)</p>
<p>"Mice climbing on a steelyard" "Self-praise" (meaning self-praise)</p>
<p>"Duck's foot" "Twisted" (meaning to cause trouble, ducks walk in a twisted way)</p>
<p>"Deer eating gray noodles" "Messed up his nose with ash" (meaning that people are not appreciated, and their faces are covered in shameful ash)</p>
<p>"Rats eating rice soup" "Covering the mouth" (rats are mice, covering the mouth means just eking out a living)</p>
<p>"Rats accumulating cow horns" "The more you accumulate, the tighter it gets"</p>
<p>"Rats crossing the street" "Asking for a beating"</p>
<p>"Beggars sitting on smoking baskets" "Ungrateful"</p>
<p>"Dogs biting mosquitoes" "Randomly bumping"</p>
<p>The above are just the riddles that I can remember. There are many more such riddles. When farmers in the countryside speak, they often only say one riddle. If you don't understand the meaning of the riddle, you simply don't understand what they are saying. I think it is necessary for friends who go to the countryside to work to know these riddles.</p>

<h3 id="e239">The Pure Poet Shelley (1) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Japanese Tsurumi Yusuke, Translated by Zhou Leshan and Qi Junfu</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>It is a great practical joke of fate that Shelley and Byron were produced in the common-sense, utilitarian England.</p>
<p>Therefore, the life of these two geniuses is a great tragedy. The two poets were tossed, vomited, and scolded by the great power of society, like two tiny drops of oil floating on the vast water.</p>
<p>However, there is probably no one who hates the power and money desires and ordinary views of life held by the British who does not love Shelley's purity and Byron's hot blood! The reason why England can become a great power in the world is not because of their materialism, desire for conquest, and human manipulation, but because in their country, there will sometimes be people like Shelley who have no materialism, Byron who has no compromise, and Moore who is foolishly honest. The greatness of the British lies in the incredible confusion of common sense and non-common sense. The British only know how to pay attention to their appetites, so they are scolded by the French and Germans. However, it produces people like Shelley who have no appetite at all. This is England's incredible power.</p>
<p>Therefore, Shelley, who was persecuted so much during his lifetime, had his commemorative statue built by Oxford University, which had expelled him a hundred years after his death. This is enough to prove that the blood of the pure and eccentric Shelley still flows in the five bodies of those meat-eating, greasy, and wine-fat John Bulls. The British Empire knows not only how to cast gold coins groaning in the vaults of the Bank of England.</p>
<p>However, what kind of person is Shelley (Percy Bysshe Shelley) after all?</p>
<p>On August 4, 1792, he was born in the home of Baron Bysshe Shelley, a wealthy and old family in England. The baron was his grandfather. His father was a member of the Lower House at the time, called Timothy Shelley. He was born with all the luck that people envied. Moreover, he was destined to inherit 2 million yuan of property, vast cities, titles, a seat in the House of Lords, and a noble family background.</p>
<p>He was a beautiful young man like an ancient Greek sculpture, with a graceful posture, sunlight-shining golden hair, eyes as clear as a mountain lake, marble-like white and smooth skin, rose-like red cheeks, a high nose bridge, and thin red lips.</p>
<p>Whether male or female, as long as they saw him, they would be captured by his beauty.</p>
<p>If he had just grown up like this: inheriting wealth and titles, being praised by women, and living like a star in the political and social circles, then he would have been restrained, but Heaven placed a great gift under his head, which was his uninhibited genius.</p>
<p>Because of this genius, he suffered all his life.</p>
<p>Because he was unwilling to be an aristocratic politician and enjoy life, mankind was able to have a collection of Shelley's poems. His life of tears is a shining gem that remains in the hall of human culture. No, all the happiness and progress of mankind are the shade of tears and suffering of certain people in the past. Human tears are by no means useless.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>His sadness began in his youth.</p>
<p>He was sent to Eton College, which educates the wealthy sons of England. At that time, Eton adopted Spartan education, and the free thought of the youths was still in its infancy, and was trampled and ravaged without remainder. Upper-grade students treated lower-grade students like slaves, abusing and exploiting them. Noisy quarrels were recognized. There were even teenagers who were beaten to death.</p>
<p>Shelley, who had the beauty of a maiden and an independent spirit, became the target of mockery for the entire school as soon as he entered this school. A game called "Shelley Bait" became popular among the students, and he was humiliated by the whole school. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening: "Gold and Love"</p>
<p>What is the most powerful thing in the world? Only precious gold and silver. It is often said that money can make the devil push the millstone. Therefore, it is gold that buys the hearts of beauties. Just look at the countless loves that are false. In the field of romance, feelings are the most fickle. Men are greedy for lust. Women love gold and silver. They deceive and love each other with gold and silver. What talk of oaths of eternal love until old age. When the money runs out at the bedside, their hearts will change. Modern female students are the most civilized. They sing that love is sacred. Only for vanity, gold, and lust. They want Western-style houses and modern cars. Look at the days when love is frustrated and they turn against each other. Love goes bankrupt and they separate. Nowadays, the morals of rural women are bad. They are fickle and get to know people. Some of them run away with their husbands' money. Some have illicit affairs in mulberry fields and on the Huai River. When they see through the affair, they send it to the authorities. Temporary couples are like floating clouds. Furthermore, there are middle-aged women with good charm. They give money to young gigolos. Giving gold and silver, entrusting their whole lives. They set the date for love on flowery mornings and moonlit evenings. When beauty fades and money runs out, love ends. Their reputation is ruined and they cut off relations with their families. Young girls become minor stars. Willing to marry old feudal lords in their sixties. They covet gold and silver and do not cherish their bodies. Pear blossoms are destroyed and sea begonias' hearts are broken. Once the old man goes to heaven. The pipa is played again and remarries. Seeing through that, countless loves are bought with gold and silver. How can there be true love in the world? It is foolish to talk about love.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Paul Muni Says He Can Be Happy with Twenty-Five Dollars a Week (Part 1) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Paul Muni is the protagonist in "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang." We have long admired and respected his acting skills. One day, he said to a reporter, "I have twenty-five dollars a week! I can be very happy." The reporter couldn't help but be puzzled. He asked, "Really? Is twenty-five dollars a week really enough?" Paul Muni is one of the most honest people, but after he became a star and enjoyed all the fruits of success, this was too bizarre and unbelievable.</p>
<p>After hearing this question, Paul Muni remained silent for a while. He was not annoyed that people did not believe him, but after thinking quietly for a while, he said, "Yes, I am telling the truth - but there is one condition. I can be happy with twenty-five dollars a month - but I must have some creation."</p>
<p>Indeed, his attitude could not be clearer. What he had said before was now clear. He once said, "If I could be free, I wouldn't necessarily want to be a star. But, whether I'm a star or not, I don't want to make more than two films a year... And those films must be of my own choice... I don't want personal publicity. I also don't like people seeing me and staring with big eyes or asking me for autographs... I don't care about being a big shot... Social fame cannot tempt me... I have never been completely satisfied with everything I have done... I wouldn't be angry if people didn't know my name... What I want is for people to get a sense of feeling and enlightenment from the characters I play..."</p>
<p>From the many words said above, I can see that the protagonist of "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" has a consistent and unwavering opinion. All he wants is a good role, and he doesn't care about all the other vain names.</p>
<p>Paul Muni also said: "I was very happy when I used to earn twenty-five dollars a month. Why can't I do it now? Money has never had much connection with me. You see, my family has always been poor. But we are not like other poor people who want to get rich all day long or envy the rich. We don't have time to fantasize or envy. We have to work all day long.</p>
<p>"When we work, we are very happy. When we are not happy, it is when we don't have work, but our unhappiness is not because we can't get wages. When I was in Chicago, the theater where I was employed closed down. I got a position in a gas company, and the salary was higher than what I got in the theater. But do you think I was happy at that time? Of course not happy. I simply suffered a great crime. I suffered because I could not move forward in my career."</p>
<p>We must know that Paul Muni is an idealist. Idealists have no harsh demands or extravagant hopes for life. He only asks to do it according to his ideals. Paul Muni said: "I admit that I want to live comfortably, and I like good things. I like to have money because with money I can buy good books, go to concerts, and buy good oil paintings. But those things can also be enjoyed by people who don't have money. I can still go to the library to borrow books, and I can still go to the art museum to appreciate them on holidays. In the summer, there are often concerts in the park, which don't cost any money. Usually, there is also free electricity, which can be heard without spending money. Therefore, when I only earn twenty-five dollars a week, what I enjoy now can still be enjoyed at that time."</p>
<p>Paul Muni also said: "Some of what I said above seems to be sophistry, because I have also told people that the reason why I entered the film industry is because the film industry gives me a large salary. Someone will ask me, since I said that I can be happy with twenty-five dollars a week, why did I make movies because of the high salary given by the film company? Yes, I make movies specifically for money. But my need for money has my own special reasons, not because having money can enjoy comfort and luxury. I have two big reasons. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e244">Review of "Homecoming" <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Hualun</p>
<p>—Golden City Film—</p>
<p>First of all, we should admire the playwright Wang Bin's attempt to depict the unfortunate suffering and heroic struggles of three women in the waves of famine, unemployment, vanity, and extravagance. Although due to his failure to extract material from the superficial phenomena of the current society and to explore the essence, followed by imperfect handling, plus some restrictions in the production process, it does not appear to be successful on the screen. However, compared with the past products of the same company, it is obviously a new attitude of the present.</p>
<p>The so-called improper handling can be explained from the point that the whole play has no focus. The author worked hard to touch on the problems of famine and unemployment, and introduced Li Xiaomei to a considerable extent from these problems, and also portrayed Jiang Xuejun; but he did not make a deep and broad development from the problems he grasped, and at the same time put down the characters he created without giving them vivid postures and actions, and turned to the disillusionment of Jiang Xiaoxia's love, and the facts of being abandoned. Therefore, only three women can be placed on two lines, and what is depicted is only a superficial outline.</p>
<p>In fact, in terms of characters, Li Xiaomei is superfluous in the play. In the front, the author borrows to explain some of Jiang Xuejun's background and personality that are not very clear, but cannot apply her well, that is, giving up the problems that he has touched and should be developed, and puts her on Jiang Xuejun's side, completely becoming the latter's shadow. If there were no her, and the author wrote directly from Xuejun, then not only would she not feel lacking, but it would be able to introduce the person the author wants to describe to the audience more appropriately, I think.</p>
<p>Secondly, Xiao Ke's character has no personality. It is not until the complete play that one can recognize that he is a frivolous young man who is not dedicated to love. Before Jiang Xiaoxia left for the so-called "freedom of love", although her sister Xuejun briefly said that Xiao Ke was a "bastard", the audience did not know why he was a bastard. Therefore, they would sympathize with Xiaoxia's struggle for love, and feel that her sister's actions were unreasonable or superfluous.</p>
<p>Speaking of Xiaoxia's personality, it is also contradictory. Because the author wrote her as a woman who smokes cigarettes wildly, walks, and wears clothes that are close to gangsters after she was abandoned, it caused the audience to lose sympathy for her, and forgive Xiao Ke's sins of this rascal. This is a regret.</p>
<p>Writing about the fact that the "Jingkui" family rents fields, and that people with "fame" owe rent is also inappropriate. In fact, most of these famous people are local rulers, who collect rent. The bankruptcy of the "Jingkui" family is not as common and profound as that of ordinary poor people. In fact, even if they are not famous people, they will oppose their daughters becoming concubines. As for writing about the oppression of tenant farmers by landlords, with female lust being more important than economic relations, it is a mistake to write primitive feudal landlords in the image of urban capitalists.</p>
<p>The director is mediocre, and the picture is too clumsy. On the one hand, letting the protagonists act too much is inevitably too exaggerated and pretentious (such as Jiang Xuejun's performance after contracting the disease). On the other hand, many plays are missed (such as the scene when the sisters quarrel over the coat). The whole sense of thinness.</p>
<p>Among the three songs, "Great Hand" is better. The dubbing committed the common problem of randomly matching foreign tunes. When Xiaomei knocked on the door for the first time in Shanghai, it was unknown whether she forgot to dub it, or the door was knocked on without any sound.</p>
<p>Except for the landlady, all the speech has a contrived stage meaning. As for the lack of emotion in the timbre, this is a matter of the actors' cultivation.</p>
<p>The acting skills are also mediocre. Although the actor who plays Li Xiaomei lacks vitality, he has more than enough simplicity. That kind of country girl's posture is something that ordinary stars who have become famous in urban life cannot match. Xiaoxia's role is easy to play, but she has not achieved a deep success.</p>

<p>— Tongyun</p>
<p>When Sharon heard what Jim said, she became more and more upset and jumped up, saying, "He was here last night! Here! I was with him! From the time we left the riverside clubhouse until this morning, he hasn't been anywhere else!" She walked closer to Jim's side and said to him hatefully, "Please leave. I can't let Mr. Peniston stay here any longer because of you." As she spoke, she deliberately acted affectionately towards Peniston, pulling him to sit beside her. Peniston sat down and leaned his smooth, seal-like head on Sharon's shoulder, patting her soft hand. She didn't know that the strength of that hand could kill. He also said, "Let's go somewhere to get married." Sharon deliberately answered flirtatiously. Jim watched, helpless, and walked away.</p>
<p>That night, Jim Brown ran to Peniston's place again. He brought Baal with him. Baal complained unwillingly, "You're like a hunting dog, sniffing something and not letting go. But you should know that when people are pushed too hard, they rebel, and when dogs are desperate, they jump over the wall. You already know Peniston is a murderer. What if he starts shooting?" Brown replied, "He's not at home right now. He's at St. Regis with..." Baal interjected, "I know, with that foreign girl. But just because you're so infatuated with that foreign girl, it doesn't mean you have to pin the murder on that man's door, does it?"</p>
<p>Jim ignored him. He said, "You stand on the steps of this wooden house. When you hear the sound of music, shout as loud as you can." Baal asked suspiciously, "Hear music?" But after a while, he indeed heard the sound of a phonograph. He thought that Brown was sometimes like a madman, and sometimes very clever. So he straightened his throat and shouted desperately, "I want a raise... I am an artist... With this little bit of pay... What do you take me for..." He shouted again and again, shouting out the words he had been planning in his heart for several years.</p>
<p>A moment later, Jim came over and said, "Why didn't you shout when I told you to?" Baal, rubbing his throat, replied, "They should have heard it on Mars. Didn't you hear it?" Jim heard it and suddenly seemed to realize something. He muttered to himself, "If she's inside the house, of course she won't hear anything. He must have returned here after taking her home, put the dead man from the wooden house in Julia's own motorboat, rowed it over, and put her on her own bed in her own house..."</p>
<p>Baal asked, "But Julia's motorboat was found in Patterson's boathouse. Then how did he get back?" Brown said impatiently, "Idiot, haven't you heard that Peniston was a champion rower in school? When he went, he put the small boat in the big boat. When he got there, he secured the big boat and rowed the small boat back. Understand, idiot?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he picked up the small boat and tapped it against the rain. Suddenly, the headlights of a car shone on him. Sitting in the car were Peniston and Sharon. Jim and Baal hurriedly jumped into the small boat and rowed away. Peniston shouted from behind, "I'm going to call the police!" Jim smiled and tipped his hat to Sharon, saying, "That would be great. But tell them to bring a swimmer. Julia lost a powder compact here when she came ashore. Please have them look for it in the water." Peniston silently helped Sharon ashore and took her into the house. He said he was going to change his clothes and left Sharon sitting alone, retreating outside. A few minutes later, Sharon glanced out the window. She saw Peniston swimming in the river. He swam down, then swam up again after a long time, then swam down again. (To be continued)</p>

<p>"Saxon Heroic Legend After the Calamity" will be brought to the screen by Twentieth Century Pictures.</p>
<p>Ramon Novarro will open a film company in Spain.</p>
<p>We do not disregard the social significance of works, but sentimentalism and pessimism are fundamentally unrealistic and of no value in art. Precisely because they are unrealistic, they are harmful to society.</p>
<p>If people acknowledge that playwrights can describe real life without any criticism, then they should not say "fill the work with the spirit of 'life's door'!" "Life's door" is precisely the author's critical standpoint!</p>
<p>Pessimism and the spirit of "life's door" must be opposed, but we must not therefore believe that sad themes will make the audience depressed, nor can we say that faithfully reflecting the tragic reality is filled with the spirit of "life's door" and will make the audience despondent!</p>
