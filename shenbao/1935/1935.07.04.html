<p>時評</p>
<h3>火柴業營業方針之轉變</h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>一矢易折。衆矢難摧。故惟集羣力方可以禦外侮。我中國之火柴。業初自外國火柴業中奪回利權。年來又受外貨之傾銷。及同業之失於聯絡。而有失敗之虞。在此一髮千鈞之際。而我火柴業能憬然於非互相團結不足以挽回頽勢。又非同業自相統制。恊定產銷。難以消弭生產過剩售價日落之危機。遂毅然創設國產火柴製造同業聯合辦事處於上海。設分處於蘇通潯京淮鎭燕贛杭閩長厦漢甬各地。自七月份起。所有大中華·正大·中國·通燧·淮上·大華·民生·大明·各火柴公司營業。劃歸聯合辦事處集中辦理。以期平衡。供求。穩定市價。是誠百業蕭條中之可喜現象也。</p>
<p>蓋外貨來我中國推銷也。先之以調查繼之以嚴密之組織。與一定之步驟。是以主客之勢雖異。而與我各自為政之工商業相馳逐。勝負之數不待决戰而定。今我中國工商業亦漸知同行嫉妬之非計。自相猜忌之無謂。漸趨於共同合作之途。整齊其步伐加緊其組織。擴小己為大我。而又不限於一區一地。則外力雖强。亦不難與之頡頏。但當注意者。聯合辦事之後。固可統籌支配。無互相競爭生產過剩售價低廉之弊。然若不從內部求整頓。出品求精良。則消費者之心理。僅知費較少之代價。獲同樣之功用。外貨如價廉。物美又將乘虛而入。故合力雖强。仍在乎善用其力也。</p>
<p>今日處境與火柴業相同者。不知凡幾惟火柴業已知呼籲乞憐之無用。起而自謀出路。其識見誠高人一等。蓋惟能自助者乃能得人之助。亦惟有自力者方可藉人之力。邇來時彥盛談統制貿易。假使各業之間。猶是一　散沙。卽有良將。何能率烏合之衆。以與人周　故必各業能自為統制。而後整個之統制可成。亦惟各業能自相團結。而後有偉大之力量可覩。又非各業與各業間。密切相聯繫。亦必遭外來勢力之各個擊。　今人方以甘言蜜語。　利美貨。　惑我工商業之意志。使其自相分崩離。析苟我工商業不察。一旦入共彀中。縱目前或可　一時之利。終必貽無窮之害。而末由振　。况我通商大埠。工商業所有之利益與彼共。之而技術管理。又遠不如人將。來之艱難正多。要舍　策羣力以外。固絕無共他善策也。</p>

<h3>日俄危機潛伏　關東軍發非正式聲明　對俄抗議頗表示憤慨</h3>
<p>（長春）蘇聯政府提出所謂日軍越境事伴、業由駐日蘇聯大使暫向日本政府提出抗議、關東軍當局對於此項報道、已於三日表明非正式之見解如左、（一）日方乘中東路釀渡交涉成立之機會、期待日蘇兩國關係轉好、徹底堅持和協之熊度、而蘇聯政府最近不知根據若何理由、動輒出其刺激日方戚情之宣傳行動實為遺憾、（二）日方因奉軍司令之命、堅决嚴禁軍　隊之越境行為、至哈伐羅夫斯　電傳之越境行為、完全虛構、實出乎意料以外、但皇軍在「滿洲國」內之行動、斷不得認為越境也（三）據布拉哥電所傳「滿洲」　砲　順天號越　、但該地决非　　　　　　也云云、（三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（長春）歐洲方面傳蘇俄政府已命令在滿俄僑撤退云云、但此處之日本官吏及蘇俄領事館、均絕對否認、恐係中東路俄從業員撤歸俄國之誤傳、（三日電通電）</p>
<p>俄報論調</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯政府公報對於蘇聯政府對日抗議文件著論如下、</p>
<p>「事實證明、在中東鐵路極重要之問題解决以後、滿洲之軍人及侵略派不惜任何代價、以圖中斷和平政治、及俄日商業關係、余等向各國宣吿、蘇聯政府再求與日本共度和平生活、吾國政府已用各種方式、以推進和平之政治·經濟·文化關係、僅未能用更决之態度、抗議若干日本軍事當局公然破壞和平之行為、余等深望日本之智慧、能克服盲目心靈、及和平政　之能克服瘋狂的冒險、」</p>
<p>眞理報指出「蘇聯政府不頒使俄滿邊境、成為一部份狂妄日本軍事當局及其滿洲附傭日益增長之奸詐挑釁行為之目標、如日本政府果欲保持東亞和平、則必採取迅速堅决之手段、以防止一部份日本當局在邊境上之冒險行動」、</p>
<p>國防部公報力言此非一部份個人及日滿地方軍事當局之不負責任行為之孤立事件、而為企圖創造日俄間之嚴重糾紛之有系統的挑釁行為、並謂「如以余等之努力避免戰爭危機為懦弱之表示、則為重大而最危險之錯誤、如有人敢侵佔余等社會主義祖國之邊境、彼將受一堅强之返擊、使其在長久期間失去此種冒險行為之胃口也」、（二日塔斯電）</p>

<p>大阪　三日上午零時四十分、香川縣小豆郡三都村地藏崎附近海上、適黑夜之際、商船別府航路之綠丸、與千歲汽船之千山丸衝突（一七二四噸）綠丸卽行沉沒、船員六十二名船客百六十名之中、多數失踪、航行附近之各船卽集於該地從事救助工作、（三日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）大阪商船公司輪綠丸（一七二四噸）、由神戶赴別府途中、三日上午一時在小豆島附近遭遇大霧、不辨方向、遂與大連汽船公司輪千山丸相撞、大破船體、海水注入如瀑布、僅經三分鐘沉沒海底、當時乘客一百六十八人船員六十一人、非常狼狽、爭先恐後欲脫險境、因此秩序大亂、跌落海水者無數、事件發生後、除千由丸外、航行附近之山陽公司輪愛媛丸及其他輪船均駛集當塲施救、大阪門司神戶各地聞警報趕派救船前綫、至今晨七時半為止、被救者共一百四十七人、收容死體十一具、生後未滿一年之嬰孩一人亦在其內、其餘七十餘人下落不明、（三日日聯電）</p>

<p>航行於黑夜之中、加以濃霧彌蔓、忽於三日午前一時六分被千山丸衝及綠丸右舷中央機關部、其船首闖入闢一大洞、僅在四分鐘之間卽吿沉沒、此時乘客三人（渡邊肇及其他二人）見勢不佳、卽跳往千山丸、其他乘客因不及取得救命圈或改乘小艇、均跳入海中、千山丸目覩此種情形、卽投下救命浮標四十四個、因此漂流海上之一百一十三人幸被千山丸救助、至其衝突原因、目下尙在調查、據千山丸則誤認綠丸為暗礁、正欲迥避之際、則其船首已闖入綠丸之機關部矣云云、（三日日聯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）據消息靈通者稱、波外長貝克與希特勒元首及牛拉特外長將就廣泛範圍、交換關於歐洲政治及東歐問題之各種意見、德國外交界謀將東歐公約問題重行加以考慮、俾德國態度可與最有關東歐局勢之友邦互相協調、德國政府似欲乘間討論但澤問題、尤其是自由邦之經濟地位、蓋但澤國社黨之舉動引起銀行及貨幣之困難、使但澤自由巿與波蘭發生齟齬、故有加以消釋之必要、然聞德國與波蘭均不願以但澤問題作為此次談話之骨幹云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）國際參戰軍人恊會及德國退伍軍人團體代表、今一致為國際合作及友好呼籲、會議二日現通過决議稱、「歐戰協約國之十一國退伍軍人團及一千六百萬德國前線軍人之代表通過議决案如下、（一）各國退伍軍人一致忠於和平、茲認好戰之徒係彼等民族之敵、退伍軍人志在利用道德的裁軍、造成民族間之互信、（二）尊重條約係國際關係之基礎、惟有彼此遵守條約中之國際義務、始能彼此維護國際間之互信、（三）退伍軍人希望彼等國家之安全、並認安全獲得保障之後、永久和平應以實際裁軍為基礎、（四）戰爭决非解决國際糾紛之道、故退伍軍人今兹宣言、現行條約苟未能調解爭端、則應將爭點提交公斷法庭、該法庭之判决應具有强制服從性、（五）為促進此項宗旨起見、昔日交戰國之退伍軍人今决密切携手、並將盡力謀取互相諒解、對於各國之方針、採取公正之態度、並將採取共同行動、以抵制足以引起誤會及阻碍彼等共同行動之惡意宣傳、彼等復將審愼以和平及公道之精神敎訓靑年、吿以退伍軍人間之互相尊敬、應為彼等交誼之南針、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>法德談判之聲　德代表訪法尚無接洽</h3>
<p>（巴黎）外傳賴伐爾總理兼外長將與德國軍縮專員李本特洛浦會談、負責方面對於此說、頃發聲明、謂德國方面尙未向政府作正式或非正式之接洽、不過此項談話卽使舉行、其目的亦並非對任何懸而未决之問題、訂立法德雙方協定也、外交界人士申說法國始終信守二月三日倫敦宣言書及斯德萊柴决議案之原則、故賴伐爾與本特洛浦之會晤僅屬一種預備性質、俾使各關係國較易訂立各種多邊公約而已、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法海軍關係　互相通知造艦情形</h3>
<p>（倫敦）因英德海軍協定成立之故、英政府現正與德法政府作外交上之接觸、商榷關於交換三國政府海軍程序應取之手續問題、凡技術上之問題、皆將涉及、如德國擬於明年興造諸艦之實在型式、及何類軍艦擬造臻所規定之最高限度之類、皆在其列、英國之意、俟由德方獲得所欲之消息時、卽能彙集德法英三國程序之情報、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）勞合喬治昨日所稱德國近曾建議廢除潛艇、但為英政府拒絕之說、孟塞爾今日於歡呼聲中宣布此說絕無根據、實屬違反明白的事實、德代表曾重申五月二十一日希特勒所表示之意見、卽他國如願廢除潛艇、德國亦願廢除之、英國首倡廢除潛艇、努力已久、自華府會議後、曾屢次推進此項行動云、（三日路透電）</p>

<h3>各海軍國　咸抱觀望態度　均不願負召開會議之責</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據此間政府領袖推測、目前各海軍國家所以競起作紙上之海軍競爭者、目的有二、一在催促他國召開海軍會議、二在謀於討價還價時、能作較有利之交易、各國對於造艦計畫、所以不肯洩露者、其意卽在於此、所難者、卽各國雖皆盼海軍會議之早日召開、然事實上則無國不欲避免召開之責任、如英國探知德國之造艦計畫後、卽謀使公開其造艦計畫、其意蓋欲從此促成歐洲各國之海軍會議、藉以澄淸空氣、俾世界海軍會議得早日觀成耳、最近英國又曾詢問美國、對於海軍問題、究竟有何意見、美國之答復卽為視他國之態度為轉移云、唯美國欲保持現有之比率、則意殊顯然、再則美國决定於一九四二年時使其海軍　於條約限度、亦為事實、然亦儘有伸縮餘地、如目下所定計畫、創新戰鬥艦七艘、將於一九三七年開始建造、期以七年完成、故美國之造艦計書、亦屬紙上性質、其意在談判時作為討價還價地步、與各國並無稍異、亦唯如此、故於最今數年內、各國是否將眞正大擴海軍、亦不無問題也、（二日國民電）</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （靑華）　　在勝利時會進攻，不一定是英雄。眞正的英雄，還要在失敗時能退守。　　有力量的人不會哭，同樣他也不輕易的笑。易哭易笑的人，都是經不起打擊的弱者。　　隨便得到的樂，不是樂。眞正的樂，是苦所組織成功的。　　人生的旅途，是一條遼長的曲折的獨木橋，勇敢的在這嘉安渡過去了，膽怯的人，每每不敢正視的敗退下來。東昌路上  落落齋主　　東昌路，是浦東新近開闢的一條馬路，現在居然也繁盛起來了。　　這條路，有對江輪渡，可以直逹浦西的東門路；有公共汽車，可以通到浦東的洋涇鎭，的確，交通方面，是非常便利的。　　路的兩旁，商店櫛比。有銀行，有錢莊，有男女剪髮所，有洋廣雜貨店，有五顏六色的市招，有誘惑顧客的廣吿；但也有大廉價大拍賣的旗幟，終日間展掛着，在隨風飄揚。路的當中，有勞苦的黃包車夫，在拖着沉重的脚步奔走着；有摩登的男女，在很閒散地手搭手的並行着。並且，在這條路的附近，還有幾所所謂「浦東要人」的公館。總而言之，統而言之，現在的東昌路上一切的一切，都顯着很迅速的進步，充滿着新的氣象，新的建設，决不像一年前的東昌路，那麼荒凉冷落了。　　在路東首，有一塊很大的空地，近來有一班走江湖的朋友，天天在此賣藝。淸唱啦，馬戲啦，魔術啦，國術啦，……說不盡的許多花樣，簡直是個露天的大世界。而他們每一個班裏，都有幾個妙齡的妖嬈女郎，每當他們開始擺開塲面獻技的時候，觀衆們會不約而同的齊集在塲之周圍，人頭攢動，擁擠得水洩不通。其實，這些觀衆們的目光，除掉畢集於那班裏的幾個女郎的身上外，又有誰注意到塲內的把戲呢？於是到了那些女郎表演的時候，嘩喇嘩喇的銅板聲，角子聲，不絕於耳。假如向彼等捐些慈善事業的經費，絕對沒有這樣的慷慨，踴躍。於此，可見咱們中國人的心理。然而，在這條東昌路上，又平添了不少的熱鬧，趣劇。陰間秀才  陳亮　　朋友；要是你聰敏一點，就會知道這是一位先生的雅號。　　這位先生姓過，身材瘦長，如風中　桿，頭尖削，鼻高如洋人『强生』，耳闊大，猶論船風筒模型，目凹，眼珠圓小像鼠，而銳利過之。兩邊面龐沒有多少肉，皮色帶靑黃，老氣橫溢。見上人則鞠躬盡瘁，唯恐失禮，見下人則眼睛望天，架子十足。常穿花呢長衫，左臂繞黑布，五年沒除去，查其家中及親族輩，沒死過什麼人。這是他表現自己是個『新人物』。　　這位先生平常寡談笑，更忌談女人，而愛女人如性命。凡遇事故，不肯擔負仔肩，專躱在暗中主使別人出塲，設下圈套，大做其木人頭戲。常常要別人的性命，自己的性命，却視同天地之大。急難之中，善出計謀，陰險刻毒，打個人家一拳，還說他的手受個傷。所以陰間秀才的名字大楊。　　陰間秀才大約得天獨原，會拍照，沒有得到陌生女人的同意，他亦會拍一個背影，而硬派伊是他的夫人。又會運動，嘗跑百米而跌傷脚骨，嘗比賽藍球而撞破腦袋，每晨練太極拳如　猻偷仙桃。又會寫字，居然正草篆隸，四體全能，嘗以對聯贈人，越三日而發現於牛肉　上，大為嘆息。　　他的品行確實不壞，全是一副正經面孔，喜規勸別人，而執住小節大發訓言，他有肺病不吸烟，他駡吸烟的是『混蛋』。他自己在天井裏小便，却禁止人家吃大蒜。他欲物色一位妻子，又要像西施，又要像娘姨，難战！公共衛生之一  涓隱　　垃圾倒在垃圾箱内小西天  張恨水著　　第十五回　苦口婆心不平空拍案錢聲燈影可憐正賣人　　賈老爺要說我們不像樣子，我們也不敢來。只是我這孩子，你可要放他回去看看我們。賈多才對於　個要求，却沒有答復。張介夫就挿言道：這當然可以。假如賈老爺在西安租了房子住下，只要你們穿得乾凈一點，也可以讓你們去走走的。這都是後話，你急什麼？錢一百五十塊，你們當面點淸了，現在你該在那張子上畫押。說若，他已走了過來，手向桌上一指。志前站着遠，也遙遙的看到，桌上放了一張字紙。朱胡氏道：紙上可是寫明了作二房，沒提別的嗎？張介夫道；諾，我來一句一句指着念給你聽。於是他伸了一個食指，點着字紙上的句子念道：立字人湖南朱胡氏。今憑　說合，願將親生女朱月英許與賈老爺為妾。比收聘禮一百五十元正。又憑媒　，賈老爺暫不携朱女南回。卽萬不得已携女南下，亦許娘家作親戚來往。恐　無憑，立字為據。朱胡氏眼睛向字定住了看着，靜心聽了下去。張介夫念完了，將手連連的向紙上點了幾下道：這還有什麼話說？這上面載得淸楚，願意你們作　戚來往。胡　子點頭道：話是很好的。不過這字紙是我們寫給賈老爺收着。我們自己可沒有憑據。這話，我們將來憑着州　說呀？（一一五六）御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　通常　是先把他們剝去衣冠，摘掉頂子和翊毛，然後押入牢中，作為是行將流徙出去的囚犯；其實是决不流徙出去的。他們只須像這樣的受上幾天或幾十天的假罪，作為是得罪先朝的受罰　待新的皇帝登了位，便立卽會降旨下來，免掉他們的徒罪，發還他們的頂戴，並依舊把他們收入太醫院，作為院使或御　。　　有了這種種的關鍵，便無怪這四位御醫老爺要如此的深思力索了！　　如今且說他們各把自己的藥方開好之後，便一齊拿來恭恭敬敬的授給了李蓮英，讓李蓮英去轉呈太后。他們想是一來受不慣那稱驚嚇，二來輕易也未便入　太后，所以不再去面參了。他們的任務，到開完這四張內容幾乎完全不同的藥方為止，便算已吿一段落了；中間少不得有一段休息。在他們休息的時候，李蓮英便捧着這四張藥方，和我一起回到太后那裏去繳差。其時太后已把餘下的一部份應辦之事自己忙着辦妥了：第一是伊先差人去召來了一個對於中國的各種藥物素有研究的老太監，另外又召了一個司書的太監，並打發兩個在值的女官去把伊的書室內所藏着的幾冊專講藥物學及藥物功用的書，如本草綱目之類取了出來；待我們把藥方呈進去，已一切都預備好了。（三五六）巿井之談  紫微　　居鄉，苦於蚊蚋，日薄崦螆，聚聲若市，夜非焚蚊烟兩縷不能居。曩就雜貨肆而購之，以無敵進，持歸試之，頗騐，不逾時，學室之蚊盡醉倒，索索自空墮落，蛾　之屬亦且屬之，惟不死，已感安適矣。於是，每購必無敵。一日，匣烟已罄，試赴近處小肆另買兩盤，諄囑須無敵，個中人曰：是也。歸而熱之，蚊未稍殺，大奇，意謂時暫俄而益盛，手揮目送，不勝其撲，兩腿塊纍脹腫，矮不可耐，竟難須臾坐，姑就枕，首面塊腫如之，　能入睡。適　天雨，乃穿帶雨具，挾餘烟詣店與論，渠且搬空匣以證之，標識果無敵也。無如何。別趨一舖，仍購　原牌，要以非贗品，歸焚而蚊竟索索下，數何止千百，心恨而志殲之，就燈下重治事，無恙矣　　因思市井中人，輒以舶來稱靈，意含推銷，而抹煞國產，此實可鄙，若小肆之以偽辭眞，使人受累，為博蠅利而其道德尙何在哉，須知上當一次，主顧下遭却步，使人　如之，其營業尚得振乎，不此之圖，祇貪目前，竊為不取，鉅細一律也，勿為事小而忽之。北海道歌  （顧佛影）　　六月初，余自東京赴北海道考察農林，尤注意其林政之設施，往返四千里，歷林塲四，農漁牧工等塲不計，過札幌，幷晤道廳林務課長桑名信氏，帝國大學林學教授吉川元民氏等，探討綦詳，旣為文紀述，更詠之以詩。　　北海有島稱寒荒，峯嶺盤亙蛟龍藏，明治英武開圻疆，始建郡邑歸扶桑，梯山　石勞不遑，遂令烏道成康莊，敷設鐵軌長復長，披圖宛若蛛網張，分田築宅爭移將，土氓執役如牛羊，千山萬山松柏樟，植以新種彌鬱蒼，按時採伐無毀傷，材用莫盡堆道旁，析為纖縷蒸為漿，巧製雲錦同七襄，（　人造絲及紙類）舢艦銜尼輸隣邦，歐人失色棄市塲，維林蓄水調雨暘，風雪被障亦不狂，（有防風林及防雪林）農功旣布歲有穰，畜牧整衍魚滿塘，化此瘠壞為　鄉，人力所至天　當，天若有詔嘉其皇，厥族雖小宜盛昌，優勝劣敗理固常，恣爾稱覇太平洋。小食譜夏季的家常菜肴  靑雲　　夏季的菜肴，當然以消爽鮮潔為上；那種肥魚大肉，在這時季，是不很相宜的。下面的幾　，都是夏令家庭中應時的佳肴。　　白切肉　將五花肉煮熱撈起，趕熱切成肉片，舖在盆裏，然後將蝦子醬油澆在肉上，吃在嘴裏很覺鮮美。白切肉切片時，須將肉皮切去。（蝦子醬油，是夏季調味的要物；他的製法，將淺碧色的蝦子，用水漂凈，裝在洋紗袋裏，另將醬油煮沸，把盛蝦子的紗袋，放入同煎，然後用黃酒澆在蝦子袋上，解去腥味。邊煎邊將浮起的泡沫撈起，俟蝦子煮熟，將醬油盛入磁缸，然後再將煎熟的蝦子倒在上面，醬油因有着蝦子的鮮味，就很鮮美了·（蝦子醬油蝦子和醬油的配合分量，是蝦子二兩，醬汕一斤）　　綠豆芽拌鷄絲　先將綠豆芽摘去頭尾，在沸水中撈熟；然後將煮熟的白鷄，剝皮去骨，撕成　絲，和綠豆芽拌和，再澆上蝦子　油，歡喜吃辣的人，更可加些芥喱或辣油，一同拌　。將綠豆芽拌肉絲，也鮮潔可口。　　紫菜拌黃瓜　揀短脆的黃瓜，洗去泥汚，然後用刀　開，將子挖去，切做半　形的薄片，然後將鹽略略漬過。另將紫菜發胖，吃的時候，將漬過的黃瓜，擠去廳水，盛於碟子，將酸醋和白精拌和，再加入紫菜，吃起來眞是又脆又嫩，可以下酒和佐粥，將黃瓜挖子，切做條兒，用醬油　熟，也是佐粥的雋品。　　扁蒲塞肉　將扁蒲削去外皮，切成寸許的段頭，將內中的子挖去，挖成　的圈兒，然後將另行切細的肉糜，塞在扁蒲圈子內，先在熱油鍋中將寒肉的圈子煎黃，加入醬油等調味作料，然後，上熓窠，用文火熓　，滋味是很肥美的。　　蘿　　火腿　揀無筋的洋花蘿蔔，將皮　去，切成小段，在沸水中煮熟，撈起候川。另將火腿在沸水中洗學，另換淸水煮沸，盛入磁鍋中，上熓東用炭團慢慢的熓，等火腿香味透出後將煮熟的蘿蔔加人同　這菜的火腿和　蔔都鮮美適口，而湯汁更其味無窮。</p>

<p>申報國貨周刊飲料國貨運動  仰葊　　最近報載意大利政府，因為國產之茶與咖啡，不够自給，而葡萄酒生產甚多，便竭力勸導國人以意產葡萄酒代替茶和咖啡。這一段消息，看似平淡無奇，可是意國人提倡國貨的無微不至，已是活躍紙上。我們中國人愛飲外國酒外國汽水外國飲料的，捫心自問要不愧死麼？　　天氣一天熱似一天了，飲料的銷路一天多一天了。酒館裏的堂倌，飯店要的夥計，他們又要興高朵烈的來替外國公司傾　飲料了。一瓶又一瓶，一杯又一杯，只知道多銷一瓶，　計們便多進一筆利子，管他是國貨非國貨，利權不利權，他們從來沒有打過這種國貨念頭，他們的良心，早已染黑了。我們自己明自，把自己的嘴巴，快快當做小海關，來立誓不進一滴外國飲料，他們便無所施其伎倆。我們也犯不着去責備他。最可恨的，一般麼登公子麼登小姐，天生成一副賤骨頭，亡國奴坏子，明明有國貨飲料，他們偏要飲外國酒外國汽水外國飲料，認為時髦。夥計們便迎合這種壞坏子的心理，來拚命的傾銷外國飲料，夥　們固可憐可歎，可是這般摩登哥兒姐兒，更加是可恨可殺。還有一般朦混的夥計，拿外國貨來當中國貨賣，往往使愛國的上他大當，你看市塲上標着中國牌子的飲料，十之八九，恐怕是靠不住的。唉，同是一國國民，為什麼程度的差別有這樣大呢？「正是無窮酒水紛紛飲，亡國傾家在眼前。」　　醒來罷，大家來一致的努力這飲料國貨運動。怎樣挽救巨大的入超？  巴玲　　在最近的各報上，不約而同的刊載着一段使人看了發生悲痛的消息，它的標題是：「我國衣食住行仰賴外貨，每年須四萬萬餘元。」我看了這個標題之後，細細的把全文一看，發現僅僅五個月的光景，上海一埠的衣食住行，仰給於外貨者，已逹六千三百六十三萬餘金單位，其他地方，尙不計算在內，這是一個多麼巨大的漏巵呀！茲將衣食住行四類的入超統計，抄錄於下，以見數量巨大之一斑：　　衣類——共計二二。三九三·七六六金單位。　　食類——共計一六·六三二，三六二金單位。　　住類——共計二〇·三七·三二三金單位。　　行類——共計四·二三三·九三七金單位。　　以上四項，共計六三·六三〇·三八八金單位，佔上海五個月來輸入總額百分之四十三，八，至值得我人注意」云云。（摘錄上月二十日本報）　　我人看到了這段消息，不知發生若何感想？在提倡國貨的聲浪，高唱得如此激昂的時候，而相反的發現了這麼一個入超巨大的消息，我們更發生什麼感想？我想凡是有熱心有血氣的同胞們，總不能不無於中中吧？　　怎樣挽救這個巨大漏巵的入超呢？如何使衣食住行的仰給外貨者，逐漸减少呢？自然，除了切切實實的提倡國貨以外，沒有其他好的辦好了！但是在我看來，我們要使這巨大的漏巵，逐漸减少，甚至於完全消滅，提倡國貨固然是不二法門，然而，尤其重要的，却在國民心理方而的建設，和發明家創造國貨精神的鼓勵，關於心理的建設方面，作者在過去，已在本刊上發表不少的管見了！我覺得一般做領袖者的以身作則，是最最有效的提倡國貨的辦法，除此之外，却要靠教育的力量，來養成一般未來的國家主人翁有一種服用國貨的心理了，不過逼是一伴眼前看不見十分效果的工作，可是為提倡國貨的前途方面着想，倒也是不可忽略的呢？　　其次，要說到鼓勵發名明國貨了，近年以來國人孜孜　　研究於國貨發明者，已很不少，我們時常在報端上看到實業部特准專利的新聞，便是一個很好的證據，同時也是國貨前　的一個很好的現象，不過在這入超嚴重聲中，很希望政府當局，以及社會人士，對於發明家予以特別的重視與俊待，使他們能用其心力，為國貨而努力而犧牲，因為發明國貨，也是抵制外貨的一個有效的方法。　　除此之外，我個人覺得我們要挽救這個巨大的入超，一方面誠然應該從上述二項入手，同時為救急計，政府方面也應該有一個服用國貨的命令，幷規定各機關，各公務人員，須一律購用國貨，服用國貨，如不遵守，也要有一個相當的處罰，在這里，我覺得六月二日上海市學生國貨年推行委員會致電國府，請重申服用國貨令，以及六月九日報載的內實財三部會商服用國貨的辦法的新聞，是很值得在這里提一提的，我們急切的希望政府當局趕快實行，因為這也是入超嚴重聲中的一針救命針呀！怎樣肅清國貨中的敗類  全甲　　日前，有一位姓應的朋友從內地來，無意中談起國貨在內地活動的情形，他說：「近年國難如此嚴重，內地的人，確實良心有此發現了，他們都要買中國貨，改變一向愛用洋貨的根性，這是一件喜訊。不過，一部份奸商，却乘人們心理愛用國貨的時候，偷偷把冒牌國貨，從中取利，一方面，大事宣傳，好像不買他商店貨物的人，不能算是熱心愛國者了，而他自己的愛國熱心，却早已變成冷血了。這是一件可悲的消息」　　的確，近年來，國貨應了需要，眞能為發展國貨而設立的公司，商店，確然也有，但是買着洋貨，掛着國貨商標，蒙人耳目，為搗亂國貨而設立的公司商店，也不能說沒有。為了要把神聖的「國貨」，拭去上面所說的汚點，我們得要做肅淸搗亂者的工作，以下三個辦法，如果能照我所說的努力實行，那麼國貨中的敗類，就不難剿滅了。　　（一）國貨團體方面：一家國貨公司，或國貨商店，開辦起來的時候，最好須經國貨團體的審查，如果合格之後，於是大家再一致承認牠是國貨公司，這種方法，好像同學校立案一樣，使得大家不能受牠的騙，當然，審查須詳細，審查的國貨團體須有相當地位和信仰，否則，便有許多舞弊發生了。　　（二）國貨工廠自身方面：國貨工廠自身，為了要防制敗類的搗亂。第一，應該把其出品的特點講出來，使得顧客不致混淆，這種方法，須藉宣傳的力量。第二，對於奸商，應予以嚴重的警吿，那奸商畏懼法律，或許可以少做着發財的迷夢吧！　　（三）顧客方面：我以為發展國貨的第一個功人，要推顧客了。外國貨無論怎樣價廉物美，賢明的顧客不買；奸南無論怎樣魚目混珠，有志氣的顧客不受他欺　，反予以嚴重的制裁。應君吿訴我的話專面，已啟示給我近年來顧客心理有多大的進步，要肅淸國貨中的敗類，顧客可以說是最有力量的一支軍隊了。顧客如果通到冒牌國貨時，第一，把這商店的黑寡拆穿給社會知道，第二，直接報吿該國貨工廠，予以處分。有人以為中國人最怕多事，我希望每個人抱着愛國的熱心，把「各人自掃門前雪」的劣根性去掉，我想，必是有志的顧客所樂為的！　　簡單地說，在目下金融凋疲，洋貨覇佔我國市塲的時候，國貨界已是受重大的壓迫了，再有無恥商人為了牟利，不顧道德，把洋貨胃牌國貨，使得國貨的名譽，因此破壞。我們要使得奄奄一息的國貨走入康健的路上去，只有國貨團體，國貨工廠，顧客方面携起手來，實行苦幹，那末，前面才是光明的大道。提倡土布的幾個要點  陸叔昂　　提倡服用土布。足以復興農村，救濟民生，這是大家都知道的，然而口頭或文字的宣傳，不可謂不　力，結果眞能服用十布的同志。還是寥寥不多見，這是甚麼道理？　　一般都市中的先生，太太，小姐們，以為用棉紗織成的布，就是士布，如果認為這種解釋是對的，那末現在智識份子，服用土布的熟忱，可算逹于極點了。試看路上行走的男女老小，不是都穿上一件藍布的長衫，或旗袍，或衫褲嗎？其實大謬不然，我們所提倡的士布，是要把農村中婦女在木機上手工織成的布，推銷到市面上去，服用到同胞身上，方是正辦。倘若像現在大家所穿的藍布，是用機器製成的，萬萬不能承認他為士布，並且更有一般無恥的奸商，用賤價買外國的白坯棉布，自己去染了藍色，加上一個國貨牌子，欺騙同胞，只顧自己發財，不管良心喪盡。照　樣的提倡　布，服用的人愈多，奸商的利益愈厚，農民的生計愈困，眞是辜負了提倡者的熱心，服用的美意，這一點不可不鄭重注意。所以我們提倡士布，對于士布的原則，先要確定，就吾個人的意見認為以本國紗用農婦木機製成的布，方得稱為土布，或者還有其他意見，請熱心提倡的先生們，多多發表，彙集報吿，使同情服用土布的同胞，有所依據，免為有名無寔的「士布運動」一個好名詞所愚弄。　　富有的人們，和較有智識的人們，為甚麼不歡喜服用土布？這心理很容易推測，士布質料組劣，形式不美，穿在身上，自己以為不體面，受人看不起，减低自己聲價。所以現在雖有幾位先生們，萬分熱心提倡，自己身上，滿身土布，躬行寔踐，可謂盡其心力，然而經他自已教授的弟子，能遵從老夫子教誨而服用土布的，遝是少數，可見心理建設，是改革一切的根本條件。吾希望負領導責任的同志們，要認請服用洋布，是奇恥大辱，服用土布，乃無上尊榮，潛移默化，使社會人心，大家認土布為好寶貝，把向來賤視土布的心理，完全改變過來，然後推行土布，方易普及　　近來藍布長袍，巳流行于各地——可惜不是士布——最初不過由學校裏少數的學生穿着，到了現在，上中下社會都穿起藍布了，可見學生的一舉一動，足以移動社會的習慣。今後只要各地學生，認淸土布的原則，一方面向社會宣傳，一方面自己先服用，吾想不久的將來，士布就可暢銷于市上了。至怎樣轉移學生觀念？則有望于為人師表的一般先生們，先自以身作則，做出榜樣，用人格來感化，道義來規勸，以富有同情性的靑年，沒有不感動的？尤望為學生領袖的大學生，首先提倡，做中小學生的模範，同時親自出思，赴中小學校，廣為宣傳，勸用士布，風聲所播，易如反掌　　吾還有一　意思，就是關于製衣的形式，亦有極大的關係，倘形式太不講究，也易使人懷疑。去年上海士布運動大會時，陳列小兒，婦女，成人，學生的許多服裝樣子，很受人歡迎，可見七布也可做成合時的服裝。吾很希望熱心土布運動的先生，對于這一點，想出一個方法，使社會人士，認識士布服裝的可愛，引起其愛用十布的同情。　　土布運動，士布上城，喉嚨也算喊得很饗了，而效果還是不見，原因就在尙少好的辦法。吾所以不憚煩瑣，寫出這一些小意見，供熱心土布運動同志們的參攷。今後希望華生電器廠  悲秋　　提起華生電器廠，到今日，祇要是稍為留心一點國貨工業的人，大槪是沒有人不知道的了。這是不僅因為華生電器廠本身有悠長的奮鬥的歷史，是以喚起人們的記憶，同時，也是華生出品的進步狀况，能够博得國人永久信用與歡迎的原故。　　憶工業先進朱其淸先生在該廠十五週年紀念刋上的一篇文章上致詞曰：「猶憶民國十二三年問，余適由歐美返國，　於無綫電事業之亟應提倡而為抵制外貨計，於提倡之先又亟應設法自製，曾商同王小徐先生於大效電機廠（是時余尙未知有華生電器製造廠，故未往接洽），創製一千五百瓦特之高週波交流發電機一座。機成，因請求前交通部予以　助，當時當局者不信國人能自行製造電氣機件，未邀許可。以一國最高交通機關尙且如此，違論一般國人。然則，以國人自行經營之最新式工業——電氣工業——而能掙扎生存於外有洋商强烈經濟力之壓迫，內無政府實際獎勵與維護之今日之下，其難不其難乎余於是不得不於華生電器製造處舉行十五週紀念之時，而深致余景佩之忱也……」　　朱其淸先生的感慨，不僅我有同感，實在也卽有志的國人所共有的感慨。　　現在的情形，當然又是不同了，在困苦艱難創業之後，華生電器廠近二十年的奮鬥史，已一躍而執國貨電器工業的「牛耳」了。而且，在出品精益求精，銷路一日千里之下，它已隱隱有驅逐舶來品取而代之的雄姿；頑强勢力的洋商，對它也不能不側目了。所以，華生電器廠的前途，是更成為不可限量的一種力量了。在建設途中的中國，無疑地這已是成了民族工業的一支巨大的生力軍。　　那麼，今後的華生電器廠將怎樣加倍努力，來復興中國的民族工業呢？　　我們愛護華生電器廠，固然希望國人對它的發展更有永遠信用與提倡，同時，我們也希望它更努力不懈：　　出品精良了，還要更求精良；</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊　　價錢便宜了，還應更求便宜：　　製造要創造化，生產品要普遍化。　　希望在今日「科工救國」的聲中，為中國電器工業，打出一條光明前進的路！國貨校長  春華　　我們的校長綽號呌做「國貨校長。」為什麼呌他為「國貨校長。」這原因說來話長，且聽我慢慢道來：　　我們的校長在上海××大學畢業，普通大學畢業生，大都是西裝革履，完全像個洋人。但我們的校長，沒有穿了西裝，也沒有穿過革履，他穿的是一套自由呢製的學生裝，脚上老是穿一雙布鞋，布底布面，而且這布又是本地產的士布。他不但外面的服裝，都是國貨布料製的，就是裏面的襯衫，也一律用國貨布料製的。　　他到布莊裏去買衣料的時候，一定先要問這是國貨嗎？這是那一家布廠的出品。問了不够，還仔細察看商標，纔安心買了回去。有時店夥狡猾，欺騙了他，他發覺了以後，一定要去退還，並且斥賣那店夥的不誠實。　　自從吳稚暉先生等提倡士布運動後，他也聞風響應，他曾宣誓過，從此以後，竭力推行土布運動。他當卽製了一套十布的學生裝，說也奇怪，士布製的學生裝，不軟不硬，穿在他身上，非常合適。這樣一來，他的服裝，是士布製的，他的鞋子也是士布製的，上下都是土布，因此又有人呌他「士布校長」。　　他一有機會，就作提倡國貨的宣傳。他勸人穿國貨，用國貨，吃國貨。他一每次看到學生穿外國呢絨布綢的服裝，一定要誠懇地和那位學生說：「這是洋貨，價錢很貴，你穿了這麼一伴衣裳，又被外國人賺去幾塊錢了，中國又少幾塊錢了，你知道嗎？大槪買這衣料，並不是你的主意，是你家人的主意，希望你以後吿訴家人，不要再買這些外國衣料。……」那時學生只好紅著臉，不敢抬頭，過了不久，我們的學生都穿國貨衣料，再也找不出一個穿外國衣料的了。於是在「國貨校長」領導下的學生，也都變做「國貨學生」了！値得注意的一個故事  　　我有一個故事　　「從前有個王老老，他獨開着兩家綢緞莊，專售國產的杭紡湖縐之類。他老是一天到晚靠在椅上窮思絕想，怎樣能使生意興隆？怎樣能多賺幾個老錢？不錯，他沒有錯用了工夫，他確能生意興隆，確能日進斗金。生活可說豐富極矣。不幸，後來他忽然害病死了，當然將所有好　萬家產，一顆兒傳給兩個兒子，　知這兩個不肖之徒，終年只是吃着嫖賭，所以不到一年竟把所有現成家產用個精光，後來索性把店關了門，沒有收入，只有支出。當然，不到兩年，就傾家蕩產，十足的作了個赤貧漢。………」　　我們在這故事裏明顯的看出王老老的所以能豐裕，這就是他能把收進的錢超過支出的錢。同時他兒子的所以破產，就是他却把支出的錢超過了收進的錢，所以，我國同胞，若常是購用外貨，只是拿錢送到外洋去，自己又沒有法子能賺到外人一文錢，那儘有多大多富的國產，過了幾年，豈不也要同歸於盡，猶似體內的血，只往外狂流，豈不要絕命的嗎？　　同胞們注意切勿見了棺材才哭呢？翻板西書的發行  李家祿　　今年經政府的規定為學生國貨年，使我們最威覺困難而不能解决的一個間題，便是購買西書了。　　全國公私立大中學校約有三千所，平均每校學生二百人，全國大中學生約為六十萬人。每人每年購買西書以國幣五元計，每年西書一項的漏巵，總在三百萬元以上，這是多麼的驚人啊！但我們為探求新智識，力謀進步起見，自不能因壹發食，而拒絕洋版書籍；可是我們為國家前途着想，也决不能聽其自然而不謀補救吧！　　據我個人最近的調查，上海有龍門，鍾山，光華，大成，麓山，慶美等書局，印有很多的翻板西書；同時北平也有一爿北京書局，專做翻印西書的工作。　　談到所印的西書，印刷異常精美，價目亦極低廉，只有原板西書四分之一的價格。所以說：「在學術方面，毫無損失，而有經濟方面，節省極多，旣可减少負擔，又可抵抗帝國主義的經濟侵略。」　　這，我想關心國貨的諸位所樂聞的吧！一週間國貨新訊　　旅菲華僑丁鴻翔來滬，參觀各國貨工廠，提倡國產向外推銷。　　嘉興國貨流動展覽會，於六月二十六日開幕。　　上海市商會呈行政院，請免征特種工業省稅。　　滬西第三次國貨運動大會，在曹家渡舉行，定七月六日開幕。　　學生國貨年推行會特製國貨影片，由教育局通令各電影院放映。　　中華工業國外貿易協會開理事會，到理事亞光製造，華生電器，家庭工業，中華琺瑯，美亞，亞浦耳。中國化學工業，五和織造，中華第一針織，五洲藥房，天廚等廠代表，由理事長張惠康主席。　　徐州中國國貨公司，上月中開慕，營業頗佳。　　中華國貨產銷合作恊會在重慶組辦國貨展覽會。　　國貨大同監會調查各廠資產負債。　　中央准中孚染料公司益中機器瓷器公司國興實業製造廠各出品分別准免出口稅。　　江蘇全省國貨工廠籌組聯合會定七月十日在鈸江成立。　　華美烟公司發表國貨合作展覽會程序。儉德肥皂廠訪問記  汝惠　　從國貨商塲回來，得到儉德皂廠參觀的介紹片，路又近，就想去拜訪一下。搭了十八路電車，到南陽橋時便跳了下來，轉個灣，就跨上平濟利路，不數十步，儉德皂廠已現出在眼前了。　　由主人的領導，二十分鐘後，便走完了所謂一個家庭式的小工廠。廠址不能非大，僅僅擁着四個屋子，但是小規模的雛形，也够完備了；在組織方面，也能見到一些「秩序」的事實。　　儉德皂商專製藍花肥皂；分子「方，圓，特大，」等六類；裝箱批發。在市場上的銷路，也很可以；據廠主報吿：去年營業總額，逹四萬一千五百七十餘元。這個數目，自然並不可觀。但是已够他們整年的努力了。　　「藍粉」的性能，有者物殊的化學作用；（漂白）所以滲和了藍粉的肥皂，更能「去垢迅速，加倍淸白」；尤其可以避免反黃。的是良好的洗滌用品。銷路的廣大，不全是意外的。　　在社會經濟這樣沒落的現社會中，帝國主義的傾銷政策的厲行，和一般市民的購買力底低落，許多國貨工廠，便不再每天拉汽笛，冒黑烟了。然而躱在一隅的家庭式的小工廠，在辛苦謹愼的營業中，却維持了他們的生命。　　全社會正鬧着「倒閉停業」的狂風大浪，儉德皂廠所以能站定國貨戰綫上，與洋貨抗爭；而從容地支持下去：我想：出品的侵良，服務的屬到，不是沒有關係的。國貨潮中之牙刷產銷概况  葉　　牙刷為工業之一種，為吾人日用必需之品，我國向以手工製造，以機器製造，而最新在我國市塲銷售者，為舶來品之燕子牌與衛生牌兩種。其時我國手工製造之牙刷，與舶來品之精美競爭，當被其推倒，到民八「五四」運動之後，一般有識之土，乃先後設廠自製，不久衛生牌與燕子牌，漸漸消滅。　　現在規模較大的國產機製牙刷廠，全國約有十家之多，其製造情形，與產銷狀况，以我所知較為詳細者，為上海第一牌牙刷廠，茲將該廠之發展經過，及製造情形，暢銷近狀，分述如次，以告讀者。　　第一牌牙刷廠，創于民十四年，工廠設于上海南市瞿眞人路，總發行所在湖北路二〇四號，當時小本經營，經五六年之奮鬥，營業日見發逹，至民二十年，增加資本。從事擴充，添購機器，大規模製造，計現有機器二十餘部，每日可出牙刷五千餘支。　　製造牙刷的過程，非常複雜，計分截骨，剖骨，定長，削骨，磨板，平孔，磨頭，磨頸，立孔，切背，尾孔，提取骨油，漂白，撞光，拋光，植毛，塡頭，剪毛，修綫，漂洗，夾板，　板，打印，剪橫毛，剪鳳頭，整理，消毒，裝盒，等二十八種手續，若連製鬃毛工作，如鬆毛，梳毛，漂白，燙毛，製色，扎毛，分長短，配毛等，共計三十多種手續。　　原料方面，不外牛骨豬鬃兩種為大宗。牛骨取自上海南京靑島等處，豬鬃取自四川湖北湖南江西諸省；均屬國產，絕無採用外國原料之必要，故「完全國貨」，確是名符其實。　　至第一牌牙刷之銷路，以上海為最多，長江一帶及華北諸省次之。近以民衆服用國貨居多，故南京方面，銷塲驟形擴大，為利便顧客起見，特設分銷處於南京太平路三八八號；且自郵政局修訂代收貨價　法以來，手續簡便；故遠處僻壞之甘陝滇　諸省，亦常有通函採購。一方亦因該廠製造得法，樣子新穎，如22號牙刷之式樣美觀，玲瓏可愛，適合牙齒生理；並有電療專家，江適存醫學博士，主持以紫外綫消毒之特點，銷費者當能樂用也。　　綜上所述，國貨日用品之產銷情形，牙刷本為小工業之一部，尙能將舶來品推倒；然亦端賴一般愛國志士努力於救國運動，不斷的宣傳所至；尤望愛國精神，永遠存在，信乎我國復興之日，期不遠矣。光榮的國貨公司  張孟昭　　從個人說：「吃得苦中苦，方為人上人」從事業說：「苦盡則甘來」慘淡經營的結果，是光榮！　　壓迫愈甚，反抗力亦愈大！國貨遭舶來品的侵略，尖銳化！麻醉化！夫人而知之，但是國貨界幾年來掙扎的成績，雖環境惡化！還差强人意，從都市到內地，到邊陲，都有國貨公司的設立，與去年記者在本刊所寫「國貨網」一文，駸駸實現了，這是何等可喜的事！　　還有一件，值得報吿的，那天記者，往中國國貨公司購物，目覩許多外國人，也　于在這裏，做我們的顧客！我不禁有所感！外國人能够歡迎我們的國貨，那關係纔是眞眞好轉呢。　　水上保險衣暢銷　本埠三馬路兆福里羅漢水上航衣廠出品之水上保險衣游泳保險帶，因其功效能浮水七天，可不沈沒，游泳航行界備此一件，可保生命危險，故自出品以來，近日各界前往該廠購買者甚為踴躍云。啟事　　曉陽·玄萬·石鳴·姚復華·汪瘦秋·郁劍超·阿敏·哲夫·潘嘉·潘伊士·珍·張孟昭·欽希·胡兆文·全甲·文斐·巴玲·麗孫·仁孚·肖自·鼎華·吟芳·天和·凌雲·諸君鑒：六月份承惠稿甚感。現稿費已結算，請即具條蓋章，於本月六日至十日，十六日至二十日，每日下午二時至四時，（星期日除外）向本館會計處領取為荷。　申報國貨週刋部啟</p>

<p>自由談論文學作品中之定命論思想  屈軼　　閱報，見艾登究成東游使命，返抵倫敦，其答記者詢以最近是否尙擬赴法時的話說：「此層為余所不知，余當先向內閣同僚報吿此行結果，總之一切均當憑天命而巳」。讀了後，覺得艾登這話，全不像政治家風度，而頗帶些文藝家口氣。固然，在艾登這口氣中，足見歐洲風靈，正未可預料；和平希望，僅不斷如絲而已。但這口氣似乎不是一個造時勢的政治家所應有的。　　但自己回過來一想，就是那種口氣，——聽天由命翻口氣，也不一定是文藝家所應專有的，事實上，叱咤風雲的項羽，一到垓下被圍之時，也不免歡聲：「此天之亡我，非戰之罪也。所以不僅僅是文藝家，就是迭時勢的英雄，也不免要陷在定命論里，嘆了口大氣，放下肩仔來的。這是自古已然的事。不過文藝家是人類中最多感而且也最怯弱的人，更容易陷入定命論裏吧了。　　但歷來的批評家，對於文藝家抱定命論思想，却未有不大讚美特凝美的。太史公批評屈原的離騷說：　　「離騷者離憂也。夫天者，人之始也；父母者，人之本也。人窮則反本；故勞苦倦極，未嘗不呼天也。疾痛慘怛，未嘗不呼父母也。屈平正道直行，竭忠盡智，以事其君，讒人間之，可謂窮矣。信而見疑，忠而被謗，能無怨乎？屈平之作離騷，蓋自怨生也。國風好色而不淫，小雅怨誹而不亂，若離騷者，可謂兼之矣……」　　這里所謂「呼天，」「呼父母，」「怨誹而不亂，」就是說明屈平深得中庸之道。中庸之道，便是聽天由命。太史公偏說屈平有點過於偏執，而偏說他怨而不亂，深合中席之道，足見太史公對於屈詩人，是很誇獎他能在一定範圍內安命立言的。幾千年來，文藝批評家，沒有不以此種溫厚敦籍的詩人風度，來獎勵一切文藝作者的。　　但這種趨向，自然也有其社會原因。因為中國社會，直到現在還沒有擺脫了封建形能心。在農業的，封建的，社會裏，藝術是每每跟宗敎合致，用一種宗敎的儀式出現，而扶助這封建社會之鞏固的。故毛詩正義序裏說：　　「夫詩者，論功頌德之歌，止僻防邪之訓；雖無為而自發，乃有益於生靈。六情靜於中，百物盪於外；情緣物動，物感情遷，若政遇醇和，則歡娛被於朝野；時當慘蹟，亦怨刺形於詠歌，作之者所以暢懷舒憤，聞之者，足以塞違從正。發諸性情，諧於律呂故曰；感天地，動思神，莫近於詩。此詩之為用其利大矣哉。」　　所以詩教是中國歷來治政的一大端。而一切詩人，文藝家，也祗能在「美」「刺」二種意義下做工夫。其甚者，却又僅知美頌，忘却諷刺。於是詩人與文藝家所走的路，越弄越狹，自然祗好安於命運。於是文藝作品中，定命論的色彩，也益發濃摩起來。　　但中國文學史裏，除却這一類定命論的廟堂文學之外，還有消極的定命論的山野文學。那就是從陶淵明開始的一派隱士文學。　　這一派隱士文學，定命論思想，更發揮得淋漓盡致。在其出發點上說，也許是因為不滿於當時政治和一切不平等現象。以文字作為逋逃藪。如明末的山人文學，就有道個趨勢。因為他們處在一切不自由的環境裏，自己生為文人，手無縛鷄之力。旣不能執干戈，對於社會國家，有所改迭；又不敢身嘗斧鉞，將赤血與白骨塡上歷史的空白。祇好發為詩歌，寄情於花草虫烏，以及一切自然美景，初則强顏為笑，勉作逹觀之語；繼則追跡莊老，佛氏；竟入化我之境；以淸凈無為的思想，洗練自已文字，自命淸高。　　但此種文學，自有其社會根據，即欲剷除，亦非一時所能奏效。我早已說過，中國社會直到現在，尙未脫却農業的封建社會這個形熊。在這個社會裏，一切生產工具，大都祇能作為「利用自然」之用，而尙難用以「克服自然」。生產工具尙未進入「克服自然」這一階段，則反映到人類精神生活裏，定命論思想就無法擺脫。老莊的一任自然的哲學，即立足在這個社會結構的弱點上。故一批最初不滿現實的人，一到處處碰壁，路路不通的時候，自己出生的社會，就呌他們回到老莊的門下，在老莊的手掌上大翻其筋斗，而自己猶不之知；以為「咱們是天高皇帝遠，不過自己白嚼蛆吧了」。實際上，老莊之「無為」，正也為的「而治」。「無為而治」與「有為而治」，其為治則一也。這二派文學家——依照周作人先生說法，前者即是載道派後者即是言志派——實則是殊途而同歸。天下未有以半斤為多於八兩者，亦未有以八兩足驕傲於半斤者。中國歷來文藝作家總全籠在定命論這一思想下，現在儘可不必各捧偶像，相互「打棚」也。　　但文藝作家其有可以擺脫定命論的思想者乎。我說：「有」，我又說「可以」。正和中國社會一步步向前嬗變一樣，在歷史演進的鐵則下。中國社會决不能老停留在封建形熊裏，中國文藝作家因之就也有擺脫定金論思想的「可能」。在此「可能性」下，中國文藝作家又可預知歷史的動向；於是以此動向為準繩，把眼前的現實，給以準確的測量，全盤地描繪出來。使讀者透過這幅圖畫，知道什麼是應該消滅，什麼將會芽生。决定自己前趨步調。那時候，中國的文藝作家，决不是個定命論者，而是個時代的先知了。文藝家而作為時代的先知的，在歐洲是不乏先例。但在中國似乎還沒有。這就因中國社會沒有像歐洲社會這麼地起過絕大的變化。法國資本主義社會開花的前夜，有福綠特爾。盧騷輩的說教，這决不是偶然的事。這是「時勢造英雄」，在任何變動的時代中，必然會有傑出的人才現。充作時代的號手。——這是歷史的必然。然而為歷史說教的，却决不是定命論者，因為他已預知歷史的動向，能克服一切阻礙歷史演進的壞風氣與壞思想。先知與定命論者的分別，一個是開車的司機，一個是鐵道上的枕木。定命論者的作用，最大的估量，不過給歷史作為一條枕木而巳。　　所以總結一句：我們現在所需要的文學作品，旣非載道，又非言志，是取反定命論思想的態度，抱有科學宇宙觀的作品。螞蟻圖書館  何為　　在目前這種艱難的情形之下，要　談讀書，似乎是種迂闊。一般有福進學校的公子哥兒，不想讀書，極想讀書的，却又給遠遠的隔開「文化之城」，因為他們沒有鍍金的能力。別說一般人沒有「嚮學」的機會，就是成千累萬的小職員，學徒，店員，也是同樣的感到智識飢荒。　　讀書不但需要時間和精力，而且也要錢買畫。一個窮人有沒有閑空和餘力讀書，那當然不是很容易解答的這我不想多說。但關於供給書籍一層，却多少可以用圖書館的方式補救一部分缺陷，雖則這種補救也是非常的不澈底。　　因為社會的不安和生活的苦悶，多少人都在熱烈地探尋眞理，而這種眞理的獲得，單靠實際經驗還是不够的，它必得求助於書本。任何圖書館都是供給書本的寳庫，非常明白。上海圖書館也有幾個，可是我為什麼單單要介紹螞蟻圖書館呢？　　這理由也很淺顯。我們大家知道普通圖書館，手被都很麻煩，要人介紹，又要繳保證金，沒有人介紹或擔保，就無法借書。可是螞蟻圖書館廢去一切手續，而且利用通信借還方法，不用地域去限制讀者。它的規模雖則還不大，可是也巳經有一萬萬册藏書，不論科學，文學，藝術，都已有相當的書籍出借。除手續簡單之外，我還可以舉出螞蟻圖書館的一個特點，那就是這個圖書館完全是讀者自己的，它的基礎完全是建立在讀者之上，對不論那個讀者，它都完全以一種兄弟姊妹的態度。絕對信任。　　因為上面的兩個理由，我覺得有向感受智識飢荒的靑年朋友，介紹這個大衆化的圖書館的價值。在文化運動之中，道個圖書館如能繼續而且積極的努力下去，無疑的將佔到一個位置。但是我絕不願意誇張它的成功，因為螞蟻國書館的讀者，還只能限於一小部分的職員和店員。　　但是這個小小的圖書館，還是有它存在的價值和必要！歡笑失去了的日子  　　最近，我又受了一次欺騙。這，使我對於在冀望的尾端上的。且夕所追求着的「歡笑」的慾念也消失了。　　記得：第一次所受的欺騙，是愛的欺騙。那時候，人正是在熱情之花的怒放的當兒，孩子氣的，一走進家裏，就躺在床上倒頭哭起來了。驀地，有一個溫藹，慈祥的聲調在耳邊響着：　　「孩子，珍惜點吧。淚是心的泉水呢。不要讓它白白地流呵。」　　我抬起頭，蒙淚的雙眼凝視那流露着母愛的臉孔。　　「媽，我受了人家的欺騙———」　　「騙嗎？」她那失掉了青春的紅潤的嘴唇蠕動着。我好像處身於莊嚴的有中世紀風味的教堂裏，聽着聖潔的修道士們的呢喃的祈禱似的。「是的，年靑人只單單的憑着熱情，是容易受騙的。然而，愛的欺騙，是不足惋惜的哪。有誰一生的時光全都埋葬在愛中的呢？孩子，愛是一時的。很短促的，不消一刻兒就巳從你的鬢角飛過去了。不要惋惜它，讓熱淚白流呵。」　　我點點頭，笑着。歡愉地，蒙淚笑着。表示我懂得了，懂得應當怎找來珍情着我的眼淚。　　以後，年齡的增加，把我由無邪的天眞的王國，帶到那個充滿了虛偽，奸詐，欺騙的世界來。　　「人長大了，懂得世事了呵。」我怕聽這句話；每逢長輩，不知是好意的誇讀，還是惡意的諷囑，這樣說着的時候，我心里就會感到一陣陣的發抖，顫慄着。　　對外面交接的機俞一多，事情的發生也多了，每逢憂鬱的氛氤降臨到身上的時候，一想起母親的話，就怡然地讓那些魔鬼在靜悄的不覺意里邊溜過　　　　　　　　　個　輕輕地，在不能確定的時聞內消逝了。　　可是，這一次我又受了騙，是第二次呢。而且，又是與埋葬了一生的時光的事業有關的。　　我想哭，儘情的流一次淚，流完它，變成一個無知覺的人，然後再重新去過那無知覺的生活。但，我不能哭，應該珍惜着這心的泉水哪。　　為了人的不能離世而生存的緣故，我只得遏抑着我的情感　　現在，我總算學會了一點東西：去分別什麼時候是白天，什麼時候是黑夜，和什麼時候是白天和黑夜的分界。——這雖是多因苦的事情，我却未曾有過抱怨，咀咒。　　痛苦，惱恨，意中事啦！一個人，除了孩子的時代外，是水沒有歡笑的日子的呵！　　是的，我從今以後將永沒有歡笑了。即使有，也是假裝的，假裝的東西怎能和眞情的比較呢！菜塲小景  黑嬰　　在南洋，擺賣小菜的市塲是被一般地叫作「巴殺」的。有一年我跟姑母住在荒僻的，屬於蘇門答拉島的東部的山問的埠頭，陪伴着息着沉重的肺病的祖母，很淸靜地過了一些時侯。唸書的興緻是退潮的江水似地低落下去了，而且簡直報紙也沒有得看，除了偶然要給問病的人寫幾封回信之外什麼事都不作。整天地在外邊遊蕩着，跟那些頑皮的馬來人到處走是危險不過的事，終於由我的祖母出了主意，要姑母把我禁在家裏了。　　「小鬼！走吓，走嚇，我早就叫你不要山猪一樣地到處走，誰叫你不聽話？現在可不受苦了麼？」　　我躺在家門後邊的芒菓樹下面，一隻受傷的山猪似地受者姑母的譴責。有的時候，我想到要反叛一下，偷偷地溜出去；可是：　　「你以為可以不聽話麼？那麼你到魔鬼那裏睡覺去吧！」　　於是就鼓不起勇氣離開家了。　　早上，祖母叫了我去，要我在她的背脊上搥。「這樣，你槌下去……不要太出力……咳，咳，咳……停一停！你這小鬼什麼事都不會做！」　　於是她把正要跟姑母到巴殺去的表妹叫來替代了我的工作。表妹把我拽到冲凉房裏去關起門來絆嘴。她駡我魔鬼；伸出手來打我；還用木桶汲了冷水澆在我的臉上。這樣她便滿足了，向我伸出舌頭，扮着鬼臉到祖母那裏去了。　　我就被姑母用來挽着表妹的菜籃，跟着她到巴殺去。這很使我高興；因為這簡直開了禁，便麻雀似地一跳一聳地到了巴殺。　　荒僻小埠的巴殺是很小的。黑色的古舊的瓦蓋起四方形的屋項抵禦着赤熱的太陽：但是，剛從東邊山丘上鑽了起來的太陽却射進了靠右手邊的魚肉桌上。三張魚肉桌的主人在爭奪着他們的生意，而我的姑母像已經固定了是那高瘦的，說着福州腔的厦門話的人的顧客，便在他的手要拿過了一條海魚，一斤猪肉丟在藍子裏，用香蕉葉蓋着——我腕上的重量頓然增加了。（未完）大學時代（十七）  德施國托謨著陳隱之譯　　今天也是這樣。我的父親是個頗為內行的昆蟲學家，幾年前，靠他的帮助，我採集了一批蝴蝶標本，至今我還興趣勃勃地採集下去。吃完中飯以後，我走到我的房間裏去，站在一個鏡箱前面；已經有三個鏡箱掛在牆上了。下午的太陽帶點誘惑性照耀在百眼蝶底藍色翅膀上，在喪服蝶底天鵝絨褐色上；我突然發生了興趣，想再一次到野外去捕捉那始終捕不到的木毒蝶。因為這種美麗的橄欖色的蝴蝶，最愛寂靜的林中草地並喜歡休息在陽光照耀的液木上，在我們這沒有樹木的地方是一種珍奇的物品。——於是我從掛釘上拿下捕蝶機，走下樓來，讓母親把一小塊白麵包裝在袋裏，把葡萄酒和水裝滿我的軍用水壺。這樣武裝着，我不久便走過裝木馬盤的廣塲，穿過宮邸花園，園內蔭道已為新葉所遮蔭了；從那裏再經過那同大門相對的另一個門，走出郊外去。早一晚才下過雨，空氣是溫和而晴期的；我看見，那裏，在地平綫邊緣，高坡上面，磨坊正在轉動牠的翅膀。　　沿着宮邸花園牆外還走了一段路，然後我隨意所之地轉向那在田圃間穿過的小徑，走出到陽光普照無一點陰影的曠野來。目力所能及的範圍內祇見田園間沙質的或石田的界堤上面偶然有一株野玫瑰或一片稀薄矮林，但這裏，粗暴的海風淸晨時十肆威虐的地方，樹木還祗開始吐出新芽而已。我心曠神怡地信步前行。，我的眼睛更多觀看遠處，而少注意近旁路邊茂草和開紅花的蕁蔴間飛翔着的蝴蝶。　　不知不覺便已過去半個下午了。我聽見城裏敲四點鐘，當我坐在礦房池岸草地上咀嚼我的不甚豐腆的點心時候。一陣愜意的凉風從水面向我身上吹來，寬闊而帶暗黑色的湖泊就在我面前。在湖的中央，湖水深處上面，現在有徵波蕩動着，那裏當是昔時雲議停住娜麗把她的外套蓋我身上的地方。我向那現在走不到地方觀看了好一會兒，我的眼睛必須用點力氣才能在湖水蕩漾中清楚地看過去。　　但我是出來捕捉木莓蝴蝶的啊！這里，周圍好遠的地方，沒有一個矮林，沒有一個遮風的　處所，當然尋不見木莓蝴蝶的。當時我想起了另一個地方，幾年前一個比我較大的靑年會經引導我去找尋鳥卵過的。那裏，四面界是上連接着長滿了山楂樹和胡桃樹；在荊棘叢邊我們時時發現一兩只土蜂被喙死了棄在地不，據博物學說道應當是百舌烏喙死了的；果然不久我們就看見這種鳥從樹叢中飛出來了，而我們也就在稠密的樹葉間發現了烏巢和有黑色斑點的島卵了。那裏，在這種樹業叢遮護的地方，也許是這類蝴蝶底王國吧！　　那個青年把這地方呌做「濟特蘭」，就是稱牠做「凹地」的意思。但是這「濟持蘭」在那裏呢？——我祇記得我們那時出城來也是走着今日的方向，又記得這地方是離開那距城約有一個德里的大荒原不遠的。　　細想一會之後，我就是也下拿起捕蝶幾來，開步前進了。經過了湖岸夾成的一條低陷的道路，我就走到一個高地來，從那裏我可以眺望面前的平地，望得很逮；但我眼睛所看到的祇是田圃連接田園，祇是一些不毛的呆版的沙場，春天的屬陽在沙上閃着光。最後，在那大荒原邊緣常有的一個小屋方向上，我彷彿發現一處像矮林模樣的地方。——至少要走半倘鐘頭才能到那裏，但我今天是有走路興趣的，就興高采列一地向那裏走去，時時有一個檸檬蝶或一個白楊蝶在我所走的路上飛過，或者一個灰色毛蟲在草悍上爬，但水毒蝶則沒有一點踪跡。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言自食其力  行安　　一個人，一到了相當可以獨立的地步，就應該自食其力。這無論對於本人，對於家庭，或對於社會，都是有利的。但中國人却並不這樣。依賴性是中國民族性的一大劣點。一個家庭中的子弟，往往是一輩子倚靠長者過活，一些獨立性都沒有。有錢人家不消說，他們一生衣食無虞，自已不想獨立，別人也不希望他獨立，落得做一位公子少爺，快快活活過日子。卽一般普通家庭，又何嘗不是養着一批寄生虫，閒坐在家裏，等人家來燒飯給他吃？　　前天報上看到了這樣一則新聞：羅斯福總統之幼子約翰，今日於坦尼西流域建設會獲得一職，准於今夏前往工作，不受薪給，卽川資飯食，亦由自備，約翰於前年卒業於紐約州聖約翰中學，近方於哈佛大學讀完初年班，身爲總統子而習自食其力，亦可發人深省矣。　　這位靑年人的精神，眞值得欽佩。他身爲總統之子，而要學習自食其力，其獨立性的堅强，可見一班。但這種行爲，在我們中國人看來，是會覺得希罕的。一位一國元首之子，好好在大學裏讀書，正可以大談其戀愛，竟要出來學習什麼自食其力。學習自食其力，無非就是在預備畢業後的出路？難道這位身爲總統之子的約翰，將來並不想坐在家裏享樂，而還要到社會上來找事做？便說要做事吧，一個靑年人有個職業，也是很體面的，他儘管在總統府或各機關，選擇一個適當的位置好了，還怕會沒有工作做，而必須預先出來學習？　　在中國，情形的確是這樣。　　我常聽人說，在外國，往往有父親在做大官，而見子去當小店員，或兒子，在當經理，而父親去做茶房的。他們是各自獨立，見子不想依賴父親，父親也不希望倚靠見子。這並非他們沒有一絲父子之情，因爲他們覺得一個人不自食其力，這是非常可恥的。　　我們趕快起來打倒這種依賴性，我們應該人人自食其力。溺  敬嘉　　一個活潑的小生命在一間破舊的茅屋裏誕生了？　　這茅屋的主人是個四十多歲的農夫，又瘦又高，村裏人都叫他「柱子」。他呆立在牀前，望着那睡在他妻子旁邊的嬰兒，一聲不響。　　後來他終於愷然地說了：「我們養不活她的！大艘！兩個見子已經够受的了！」　　他的妻用遲鈍的眼光望了望他的臉，又望了望嬰兒微微地點點頭，把眼睛閉了，痛苦地哼道：「好，你拿去吧！」　　他顫抖着手把那熟睡着的嬰兒從床上抱起來，拿了燈，走到另外一間茅屋　　產婦痛苦地呻吟着。在搖曳不定的菜油燈光下，她的臉色更覺得難看了。　　「阿大的爹，」產婦喘着，用微弱的聲音問：「是自家的還是人家的？」（註）　　「人家的。」　　產婦搖了搖頭，嘆了一聲，呻吟得更厲害了。她的丈夫囁嚅着，好像有必要的話而又不敢在虛弱的妻前講似的。。在那兒，有一個猪柵，二隻瘦猪在打鼾。柵旁是一個毛坑，毛坑的左邊放着一雙尿桶。他走到尿桶邊停住了。把燈擱在柵上，舉起嬰兒就想向尿桶裏丟。正在那時侯，嬰兒醒了，呱呱地哭起來，使那個可憐的父親不能不把手縮回來了。　　他在微弱的燈光下望着手中的嬰兒。他發現那嬰兒長得十分可愛，又白又胖，五官很莊正，四肢也極勻均。他想要是她生在富貴人家，可不是位千金小姐麼？然而她偏要投生在他家裏來！是她自己願意這樣嗎？還是老天爺故意要玩這種悲慘的把戲呢？他不禁發呆了。　　嬰兒哭號着，好像她知道要受到痛苦似的。看到她的淚珠，她的張開的嘴巴，他越覺得難受了。他用手輕輕地拍着她的背，在屋走來走去。嬰兒不哭了，却睜着小小的眼睛望着他，好像要深刻地認識她的父親似的。　　「我怎樣忍得把你處死呵！」他自言自語着。後來竟抱着孩子，提起燈，想把她依舊放到牠母親的床上去了。但當他走到門邊時，又停下來了，因爲他想到了他的能力他的財產。他知道自己决沒有能力去養活她的，他已經有着兩個兒子了！再添上一個人口，只好大家餓死。這樣，非但不是愛惜那個可憐的嬰兒，反而是害她多受苦了。「還是溺了的好，還是溺了的好！」他悲痛地說：「窮人只有窮人的命的，他們决不能留着他們所愛的一切的！」　　於是他回到尿桶邊，把眼睛閉了，將嬰兒丟在桶中。起初還聽得幾聲慘啼，後來將寂然了。他偷偷地睜開眼，提起燈來向桶中望了望，只見那無辜的孩一子還浮在尿面上掙扎。不久後就不動了。　　「不是我忍心溺掉你，只怪你自己不生眼跑到我家來！」　　他哭起來了，痛苦地把孩子撈起來，放在一個破蒲包裏，提到野外去埋了。　　當他回到妻的床邊時，已經泣不成聲了。而他的妻呢，也早已傷心得昏厥過去了。　　鄉村睡在黑暗中，靜靜地，好像不知道這回事似的，又好像知道這回事而又多見少怪亳不經意似的。　　（註）自家的卽指男的，人家的指女的，是一句鄉語。船夫  施瑛　　新市到德淸的快班船中，阿龍是四個船夫裏的一個。在以前水鄉裏的交通，全是快班船航船一類維持的，有了小汽輪後，生意便不容易做了，有時搖着空船來回；可是除了貨物裝運外，也有</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>幾個省錢的買賣人搭乘，所以一船的人，還可以靠老板吃飯。當天才黎明，朝陽紅暈暈地映在河中的時光，阿龍睜開疲倦的眼，鐺鐺地敲起小銅鑼來，這是預備開船催促客人的招呼。於是店家的棧司，送着成簍裝箱的貨物，來到船上，可囑着老板。在船埠上，有兩三個客人，脚步那樣嬾散的，彷彿臉也沒洗過、眼角掛着眼脂，一手挾着紙包，一手拿着點心，默默地走到船上來。老板一臉笑容地招呼着。自然也有阿龍說話的份見。「張朝奉、你今天回德淸嗎？賬收的怎樣？」「趙客人，新市的羔皮價錢怎樣？這次賈去得多嗎？」那些客人，總敷衍地應着，沒有睡彀的臉上，帶着暗淡的神氣。這年頭兒，出門做買賣的人，總難得滿着笑臉來回的。看見埠頭再也沒有搭船的客人了，阿龍放下小鑼，在船尾和另一個船友搖櫓開船。老板坐在船頭抽煙，一邊對着船裏稀少的客人縐眉。那發個客人，有的在吃着糕點，有的掏出紙煙來抽着，心裏也彷彿在愁思。望着那樣的情景，誰也不能覺得高興。阿龍祗能低頭搖櫓。那時船出了柵，河而也闊了，他一股悶氣，便在板櫓的力上發洩。　　船是當天來回的。中午的時光到了德淸，忙者送貨送信，吃午飯也得趕緊往嘴裏塞，便又敲起小銅鑼開船，搖回新市，載的又是零零落落的幾個客人。年靑的阿龍，沒有別的嗜好、祗愛喝幾口老酒；他的工錢，大部份是花在鎮上的醬園裏的、可是午飯的時光，簡直沒有嚼碎飯粒的功夫、不用說喝酒。一直到暮色蒼茫的黃昏、快班船回到了早晨啟椗埠頭，才可以放下一天的疲倦，舒服地吃夜飯，阿龍一邊將黃酒向嘴裏灌，一邊和船友們說着粗話，眼睛火紅，嘴晨濺着唾沫。老板卻埋頭吃飯，心裏啃着算盤，計算着開銷，臉顯得沉重了。阿龍望了老板一眼，也知道者板憂愁的是甚麼。—但是老板的憂愁，是和阿龍沒有關係的。阿龍是年靑，有着風日裏鍜成鋼鐵樣的身體，牛樣的氣力，他又沒有家庭，祗有在故鄉一個自己還能找生活的老母。阿龍可以勞力換飯吃，卽使老板停了船，他難道會餓嗎？—年靑人的希望，便是有一個女人。阿雖然渴望着，可是牛馬樣的生活，祗彀塡飽自己的肚子，娶一個女人，也要永遠是夢想，在這一點上，阿感到悲哀了。　　每天每天，永遠是這樣的工作，在這熱識而厭倦的水程來回，船是沿着塘路走的，為了使船行得快一點，便是幾個人在岸塘上背縴拖着沉重的船前進。阿縴和另外一個强壯的船夫，幹着背　的生活。他傴　着背，低者頭，在那崎嶇的塘路上，一步一頓地前進。他有力氣，可是想到他的希望，他的將來，這生氣活躍的漢子，也落入憂鬱中了。像背一樣，一步一頓地，每天這同樣的路總是走不完的。—這同樣的路，竟沒有走完的時光嗎？　　拆拆拆！賣糖粥，高樓酒酣飯飽人，怎知鍋裏粥厚薄？擠菩薩  丁蔚南　　—鄉風剪誌—　　陰霾的天，是菩薩保護設有下雨的日子？不過風是拂拂地吹着，像要重溫昨日的舊夢，坂上的泥水田，照者天空，悄悄地躺着，靜待着那種每年一度底光榮似地，微微的細浪動着，儘浮起笑靨，但有一種隱憂似地，當心着會有更厲害的底蹂躪，然而，它還是壤起驚喜的情調兒似地，那麼底待着。　　三銃響着，道士的音樂也賣了起來，全村都被震撼的動。三座三官菩薩老爺，給成羣的農人們，抬了出來。朝門外是滿等着虔誠信仰的善男信女們，都那麼誠懇地，合十着，口裏不敢亂說一句話，畢恭畢敬地，支着各自的身子，在歡迎它老人家出來。給幾個着長衫的引道的首士們，嘴吧裏嚷着：「讓開，讓開，」打通一條路似的，把菩薩抬了出來，成羣的人又擁在它的後頭。每一個人的面孔上，誰也不敢懷着這是看熱鬧的情調，都其着十二萬分的熱心，在那裏為它祝福着——為自己地祈禱着。　　全村裏都早日就齋戒好了，這樣一年一度的日子，祖上傳下來的那一種沿習，誰個又會忘記了呢？恰如一個人不會忘記吃飯一樣。　　上半天是各人都要到廟裏去朝拜的，檀香，蠟燭照耀在這幽暗暗的廟堂裏，這些菩薩除了今天這種日子，是它底份外的光榮外，一些平常的包子，是有一個老道士，為之料理，一炷淸香一盞琉璃燈，那麼空洞洞地在那裏外，面是很少有人會常到這兒來的。　　然而菩薩是財主，它有幾百畝田，不過這些醮產，都是首士們替它管的，到這個日子，大家來熱烈朝拜一下，組織一個這麼的會：到坂上泥水田裏去「擠菩薩。」自然還有有他沿下來的社會的原因。聽得老班輩說：「人是要靠菩薩保護的，我們種田的，是全靠禾苗好，畜生好，人口太平，一些邪神是怕正式的菩薩的，所以我們每年在春天裏要擠菩薩，把瘟神邪鬼，屬蝗旱水的災患，都給它老人家趕走的，我們也就可以太太平平過日子了」。　　你越是有事，日脚越是過得快，一個短短的上半天，在廟裏轉了幾轉，不一會兒就下半天了，大家就要預備去擠菩薩。我們祇聽到了響了幾銃，菩薩在村兜了幾個轉子，就飛快朝坂上的泥水田裏，四個人抬着一座菩薩，在泥水田裏擠來擠去，一共是有三座，看那座的力氣大，便給獎錢。在一個十二畝的田裏，大家儘擠着。泥水翻在菩薩的面上，菩薩的袍上，人是差不多全給泥水弄汚了去。像是菩蕨沐浴一樣。橫豎弄汚了是不要緊的，越污越好，等一會見擠好了，首士們會給它老人家，換袍，揩面，抹身上的，重新又是一個新的菩薩的再現。　　在這坂上，田的兩旁的路上，是站遍了好多人，祇聽到：「用力呀，用力呀」的聲音外，就是嘩唎嘩唎的菩薩的轎子破着水的聽音！　　神銃是時時地隆隆的響着，燃香，燒紙錢是刻刻不可少的。在兩旁路上的首士們，督促抗菩薩的人「用力」。道士們的虔誠的音樂，可噹地儘奏着，在這遼曠的天空。　　虔誠這許多人，都望望天，陰霾的沒有下雨，擠菩薩的日子是不好下雨的，下雨就是年成不太平的預徵。昨日的綿綿的雨，都促起全村人的憂蹙，然而今天是沒有下雨，大家都說，這是菩薩保護的日子，該是年成好吧？都那麼地慶幸着。市塲  林熙　　我不明白為什麼近來我討厭進市塲了。　　討厭進去有時也還是得進去的，看見報上刋出了新出雜誌的目錄，總不免要到市塲裏去翻翻，但那股心情眞是使我不大好受的。我好像不適宜於進市塲，那個空氣我吸不慣，我所見到的，許多都很碍眼，倒不陌生，只是碍眼，和我合不來；有的時候我覺得很煩，我沒有勇氣去翻更多的目錄，很快地我就會踱出來，像有什麼東西在趕我。　　我憋得慌，在市塲裏我憋得慌，那空氣我吸不慣。　　大商店裏播出的音樂，我聽不慣，而且我也沒有那個心情，我不需要牠：我需要的在市塲裏也有，但絕不是這個。我不明白那些人都是懷着什麼樣的心情去傾聽，一個個拉長了脖子，讓那音樂帶着滾，他們也許是需要一點麻醉的，他們也願意受麻醉，那些音樂像膠水，會把他們黏住，像蒼蠅，黏在蒼蠅紙上了。但我可聽不慣，每一聲響於我都是火舌，向着我捲來，，我聽了很燥，很煩，我會很快地逃開。　　新雜誌的目錄，有時我也怕去翻。一個嚴重的題目，上面常常帶着女人的腿和臉；「黃災救濟的方策」，有的人會這樣寫着，我也有時翻翻，我想看看他們的方策，他們都說得很好，也很博；跟着那些方策就是如何把臉擦得更勻，如何修指甲，如何烹鮮魚，他們說黃花魚要怎樣食方不鬧肚子，他們也說到什麼用鷄蛋洗頭髮，便可洗得又柔又亮；這些我懶着翻下去，那也像音樂，長着火舌，我耍避開，有時我眞怕去翻牠們。　　大商店的玻璃櫃裏，裝着摩登的典型——女人，和櫃子外面的相對照；這個於我倒不陌生，只是我怕見着。我想起一篇小說裏的話：你們男子賈你們的思想，甚至你們的靈魂，為着生活；我們女子也買，也是為着生活；賈的卽或不同，為着生活却是一樣的。……是的，為着生活，女人多早熟了。　　遊藝塲才是人和獸的地方，這邊有人在要狗熊，教狗熊用兩隻腿走道；那邊耍着猴子和狗：猴子穿起紅的褡槤，會伸手去向觀客耍錢，狗也學會了鞠躬；又一邊是赤背的大漢在搏鬥，角力，他們也鞠躬；一個老頭子教一個女孩子翻觔斗，也鞠躬；所不同的只是人更會表情，癟着臉，乾笑，嚥下淚；是的，猴子和狗熊沒有淚，狗也沒有淚。……　　這些地方我眞憋得慌，那空氣我吸不慣。播音節目彈詞　　程方舟李蓮蓀毛家書　　華美（一〇六〇）下午三時至三時三刻　　開篇「水滸」第五　　奉公差遣欲登程，別兄何日返家庭，金蓮痴想回心意，塗脂搽粉最殷勤，呼叔叔，笑盈盈，那知武大不在心，武松是，親敬三盃分離酒，要事三莊兄婦聽，不可一日家無主，早出晚歸莫夜深，休同鄰舍通來往，王婆不許進腰門，年輕浪子休交友，諸般萬事耍留神，武大郎，心老成，三盃飲畢就應允，潘氏傍邊心不悅，老老不生向出行，不戴方中男子漢，衣袖上，走得人，腰背上，馬能行，可稱一位女夫君，武松聽，心已明，若說此事萬不能，回頭囑付親兄長，歸來切莫近黃昏，武大難禁傷悲淚，未知何日再相親，斷腸人相送斷腸人，歌唱　　夜鶯藝社　　中華（一一四〇）下午四時一刻至五時　　的的篤篤（前奏曲）太平花（王蝶）悲秋（曼娜）當夷為民（露茜）白蘭花（綠茵）自殺尙未成功（王蝶）滿江紅（曼娜）老鳳陽歌（露茜）舟中曲（綠茵）　　敦本（八〇〇）下午八時至九時　　本人舞（前奏曲）吹泡泡（露茜）國花（流朗）我們的皇后（曼娜）特別快車（綠茵）鐵路下的歌女（露茜）義勇軍進行曲（曼娜）寒衣曲（王蝶）逃亡曲（綠茵）　　曼傑社　　國華（一二〇〇）下午五時一刻至六時　　長記得（曼傑）愛神的箭（曼英）春朝曲（耐雪）謝謝你的口香粉（曼雄）努力歌（全體小姐）　　國華（一二〇〇）下午六時一刻至七時　　夜來香（曼傑）我願意（曼雄）瑪麗若是你願意（曼英）矣曼麗（曼傑）銀漢雙星（耐雪）　　中國玲音音樂歌詠社　　利利（一二四〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　漢宮秋月（前奏曲）夜戰場（石琦霞）人問仙子（緣茵）愛情是什麼（逃亡）綠裙隊（許玲玲石琦霞）小小茉莉（綠茵）風雨歸舟（許玲玲）摩登戀愛（石琦霞）</p>

<p>(Hankou) The Han River is only inches from the bank, southern Hanyang is already flooded, over a foot deep. (Third Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Change in Business Strategy of the Match Industry</h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>A single arrow is easily broken, but many arrows are difficult to destroy. Therefore, only by gathering the strength of the group can we resist foreign insults. China's match industry initially reclaimed its interests from foreign match industries. In recent years, it has suffered from the dumping of foreign goods and the lack of cooperation among domestic enterprises, and is in danger of failure. At this critical moment, our match industry has realized that it is not enough to unite with each other to reverse the decline, and that it is difficult to eliminate the crisis of overproduction and falling prices without unified control and coordination of production and sales among domestic enterprises. Therefore, it resolutely established the National Match Manufacturing Industry Joint Office in Shanghai, with branch offices in Sutong, Xun, Jing, Huai, Zhen, Yan, Gan, Hang, Min, Chang, Xia, Han, and Yong. Starting from July, the business of all match companies, including Da Zhonghua, Zhengda, Zhongguo, Tong Sui, Huai Shang, Da Hua, Minsheng, and Da Ming, will be transferred to the Joint Office for centralized management, in order to balance supply and demand and stabilize market prices. This is indeed a welcome phenomenon in the midst of a business recession.</p>
<p>Foreign goods are promoted in China first with investigation, followed by strict organization, and a set course of action. Therefore, although the strength of guest and host are different, when competing against our own independent industrial and commercial enterprises, the outcome is determined before the final battle. Now, Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises are gradually realizing that it is not wise to be jealous of each other, and that mutual suspicion is meaningless. They are gradually moving towards cooperation, aligning their steps, strengthening their organization, and expanding the self into the greater whole. And they are not limited to one district or one region. Then, although foreign forces are strong, it will not be difficult to compete with them. However, it should be noted that after the establishment of the Joint Office, it can indeed centrally plan and eliminate the disadvantages of mutual competition, overproduction, and low prices. However, if we do not seek internal rectification and strive for better quality of products, consumers will only know to pay less for the same function. Foreign goods, if they are cheap and of good quality, will take advantage of the situation. Therefore, although combined strength is strong, it still depends on making good use of it.</p>
<p>Today, there are countless industries facing the same situation as the match industry. However, the match industry knows that it is useless to appeal for pity, and has risen up to seek its own way out. Its insight is indeed superior. Only those who can help themselves can gain the help of others, and only those who are self-reliant can borrow the strength of others. Recently, contemporary figures have been advocating for unified trade. If industries are still a pile of loose sand, no matter how good the general is, how can he lead a rabble to compete with others? Therefore, each industry must be able to control itself before overall control can be achieved. Only when each industry can unite with each other can a great power be seen. And if each industry is not closely linked to each other, it will inevitably be attacked individually by foreign forces. Today, people are using sweet words and benefits to confuse the will of our industrial and commercial enterprises, causing them to disintegrate. If our industrial and commercial enterprises do not see through this, once they enter the trap, even if they can gain temporary benefits, they will eventually suffer endless harm and will not be able to recover. Moreover, our major trading ports share the profits of industrial and commercial enterprises with them, and their technology and management are far superior to ours. The difficulties in the future are many. Apart from abandoning selfishness and gathering strength, there is absolutely no other good strategy.</p>

<h3>Japan and the Puppet Regime to Sign New Economic Treaty, Japanese Privy Council Approves Original Draft, All Members Have Been Selected</h3>

<h3>Japan-Russia Crisis Lurks, Kwantung Army Issues Unofficial Statement, Expresses Indignation at Russian Protests</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The Soviet government has lodged a protest with the Japanese government through the Soviet ambassador to Japan regarding the so-called border crossing incident by the Japanese army. The Kwantung Army authorities expressed their unofficial views on the 3rd regarding this report, as follows: (1) Japan, taking advantage of the establishment of the Sino-Eastern Railway transfer negotiations, hopes to improve relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and thoroughly adhere to a cooperative attitude. However, it is regrettable that the Soviet government has recently engaged in propaganda activities that stimulate Japanese feelings without any basis. (2) On the orders of the Feng Army commander, Japan has firmly prohibited military personnel from crossing the border. The border crossing incident reported by the Khabarovsk telegraph is completely fabricated and beyond expectation. However, the actions of the Imperial Army within "Manchukuo" must not be considered as crossing the border. (3) According to the report from Bragov, the "Manzhou" artillery boat Shuntian crossed the border, but that location is definitely not. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) It is rumored from Europe that the Soviet government has ordered Russian expatriates in Manchuria to withdraw, but Japanese officials and the Soviet consulate here absolutely deny this. It is feared that it is a misreport of the withdrawal of Russian employees from the Sino-Eastern Railway to Russia. (Den Tsushin dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Russian Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's communiqué commented on the Soviet government's protest document to Japan as follows:</p>
<p>"Facts prove that after the resolution of the extremely important issue of the Sino-Eastern Railway, the military and aggressors in Manchuria are sparing no effort to interrupt peaceful politics and Russian-Japanese commercial relations. We declare to all countries that the Soviet government is seeking to live peacefully with Japan. Our government has used various methods to promote peaceful political, economic, and cultural relations, and has only failed to protest the blatant acts of sabotage of peace by some Japanese military authorities with a more decisive attitude. We deeply hope that Japan's wisdom can overcome blind minds, and that peaceful politics can overcome insane adventures."</p>
<p>The Pravda pointed out that "The Soviet government will not allow the Russian-Manchurian border to become the target of increasingly treacherous provocations by some arrogant Japanese military authorities and their Manchurian stooges. If the Japanese government truly wishes to maintain peace in East Asia, it must take swift and decisive measures to prevent the adventurous actions of some Japanese authorities on the border."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense communiqué emphasized that this is not an isolated incident of irresponsible behavior by some individuals and local Japanese-Manchurian military authorities, but a systematic provocation aimed at creating serious disputes between Japan and Russia, and stated, "If our efforts to avoid a war crisis are regarded as a sign of weakness, it would be a serious and most dangerous mistake. If anyone dares to invade the borders of our socialist motherland, they will receive a strong counterattack, depriving them of the appetite for such adventurous behavior for a long time."

Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate it. However, it is said that neither Germany nor Poland wants to make the Danzig issue the backbone of this conversation. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>War Veterans Join Hands to Appeal for Peace</h3>
<p>Representative Assembly Passes Five Resolutions, Opposing War and Promoting International Cooperation</p>
<p>(Paris) The International Federation of War Veterans recently held a meeting here.

(4) International disputes must be submitted to arbitration for resolution. (5) Members are willing to maintain close contact to create the necessary environment for realizing the above claims and to achieve mutual understanding. Oberlindober, chairman of the German delegation, told a Havas reporter, "We were enemies yesterday, we are comrades today, and we will be good friends tomorrow."

<p>(Paris) Representatives of the International War Veterans Association and German veterans' groups unanimously appealed for international cooperation and friendship. The meeting passed a resolution on the 2nd stating: "Representatives of the eleven countries of the European War Alliance and the 16 million German front-line soldiers have passed the following resolutions: (1) War veterans from all countries are unanimously loyal to peace, and now recognize warmongers as enemies of their nations. War veterans are determined to use moral disarmament to create mutual trust between nations. (2) Respect for treaties is the foundation of international relations. Only by respecting the international obligations in treaties can mutual trust between nations be maintained. (3) War veterans hope for the security of their countries, and believe that after security is guaranteed, lasting peace should be based on actual disarmament. (4) War is by no means a way to resolve international disputes. Therefore, war veterans now declare that if existing treaties fail to resolve disputes, the points of contention should be submitted to a court of arbitration, and the judgments of that court should be forcibly obeyed. (5) In order to promote this purpose, war veterans from former belligerent countries now resolve to work closely together, and will strive to obtain mutual understanding, adopt a fair attitude towards the policies of each country, and will take joint action to resist malicious propaganda that is likely to cause misunderstandings and hinder their joint action. They will also carefully teach young people in a spirit of peace and justice, and inform them that the mutual respect between war veterans should be the compass of their friendship.

<h3>Floods Scour the Xijing Bridge. Situation of the Great Japanese Flood (1)</h3>
<p>Lloyd George Declares Return to the Political Stage, Promoting His New Deal Proposals</p>
<p>(London) Lloyd George, the famous British Prime Minister during the European War, who previously proposed a New Deal to the government, today gave a speech at a conference in London, announcing his return to the political stage. The conference passed a resolution proposed by George, advocating the establishment of an "Action Committee" to seek the return of representatives dedicated to implementing peace and construction policies to the next parliament. Today's conference was chaired by George, and Viscount Snowden, who once served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and is one of the key figures supporting George's New Deal, also attended and shook hands with George in welcome. It is noted that the Viscount left the Labour government in 1931 due to disagreements with MacDonald and aligned with Sir Samuel, the leader of the "Samuelite Party." According to George, he has been urged by various parties for a long time, especially by a vast number of people not misled by political parties, so he is returning to a life of activity. He initially did not want to do this, but once decided, he is willing to devote all his energy to it. George is already seventy-two years old, but his old fighting spirit remains, making him a worthy example of being vigorous in old age. George opposes the unceasing expansion of armaments, saying that the world is wasting 1 billion pounds annually on armaments today, whereas it was only 700 million pounds ten years ago. He also said that the government has lost many opportunities, hearing that Germany had proposed abolishing submarines, but Britain did not accept it, and he hopes this is not true. George expressed his opinion that the current international disturbances are mostly due to economic difficulties, and if the world's nations can find a good way to resolve their economic difficulties, the atmosphere of war will gradually disappear.

<p>Austro-Czech Police Cooperation, Both Parties Conclude Agreement, Clamp Down on Austrians Entering Germany Without Permits</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Austrian and Czech police authorities have concluded an agreement stipulating that in the future, Austrians entering Germany through the Czech border without permits will be detained and extradited to Austria. The Berlin press is greatly angered by this, saying that Austria has agreed to hand over German minorities who fled to Austria to avoid Czech military service in exchange. This agreement is the result of recent talks between the Austrian and Czech Foreign Ministers, Walden and Beneš, on police cooperation between the two countries. German newspapers point to this secret agreement as a cunning anti-German plot and another new fact of the Schuschnigg government's anti-German policies. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang's Instructions on the Current Urgent Tasks of Governing Sichuan and Saving the Nation</p>
<p>A Speech at the Enlarged Memorial Week in Chengdu (Continued from Previous)</p>
<p>However, the quality of the army itself is not yet sound. If we want the army to set an example and teach ordinary people well, it will inevitably be impossible. We should start with the army itself, first teaching ordinary soldiers, so that each soldier is first an ordinary good citizen, possessing the necessary moral intelligence and spirit of an ordinary person, and then cultivate a general of sound revolutionary soldiers from intelligence, trust, benevolence, courage, rigor, and strictness. Only in this way can they be a model for the common people. Therefore, the masses are the foundation of the army, and the army is the model for the masses. Therefore, soldiers must never abandon themselves and neglect personality as before, or fail to invigorate their spirit. They must promote the spirit of taking the lead and become upright soldiers who can be a model for the people and save the country and its people. In this way, the masses will welcome them everywhere, and they will not be hated or despised. On the other hand, the general public must not think that soldiers do not have good food or clothing and treat them as inferior, casually disliking or scolding them. This is not right. In fact, the people should respect and cherish soldiers. If they can truly respect them, they will naturally respect and cherish themselves more and protect the people. Therefore, soldiers, especially senior officers in the army, must know that the army is a model school for the people. Soldiers should not think that they have fulfilled their duty just by drilling and fighting. When soldiers first enlist, officers must tell them that now that they wear a military cap and uniform, they are no longer ordinary people but a person with a noble character, a responsible position, and a responsibility to protect the country and its people, a soldier who can sacrifice everything for the country and its people, and even more a model for the people, who should respect, honor, be independent, and strive to fulfill the duties of a soldier, and every soldier must understand the principles of being a person, cultivate their personality, invigorate their spirit, and train their intelligence to be a model for the general public. Every army must be a model for the general school. On the contrary, the methods of teaching and training students in general schools should not just be teaching knowledge from textbooks on the blackboard in the classroom. They should implement education with the spirit of the army training soldiers. Not only should boys' schools be like this, but also general girls' schools. They must make every student understand etiquette, know shame, value morality, and be proficient in martial arts, so that every student's life is full of discipline and sacrifice. Only in this way can they be true modern students and modern schools. All powerful countries in the world do this. Therefore, it can also be said that schools are the ordinary armies of society. In this way, soldiers are the people, and the people are soldiers, and the army is the school, and the school is the army, which completely conforms to the principle of combining literary and military education. Whenever the country is in trouble, the peasants in the countryside and the students in the schools can come out at any time to serve on the battlefield and defend the country. Only in this way can our country be saved, our nation be revitalized, and our revolution be completed. People from all walks of life who are responsible for education should especially understand and practice this principle. In addition, when we establish political armies and even rectify society and the country, we must first establish discipline. If discipline is not established, whether it is the political army, the family, society, or the country, it will definitely not be able to be established, and all chaos will arise from this. If the country has no discipline, the country will perish. If the army has no discipline, the army will be in danger. If society has no discipline, society will be chaotic. If the family has no discipline, the family will fail. What is discipline? It is the organizational system. Why are we Chinese despised and regarded as a country without organization? This means that our country has no discipline. Especially now, foreigners criticize us Chinese not as humans but as a group of insects. What does this mean? Insects have no knowledge, no organization, swarming and buzzing, numb and apathetic, allowing others to oppress and trample on them, and they are still unconscious until they die. He compares us to insects, meaning that we have no discipline, subordinates do not obey superiors, local authorities do not obey the central government, branches are scattered, there is no organization, and everyone must know the difference between humans and insects, which is that humans have organization and training, and are able to understand and know shame, and follow reason and abide by the law, while insects are the opposite. Now, all aspects of our families, whether it is the army or society, lack organization and training, and many people do not follow reason or abide by the law, which leads to them being scolded as non-human insects. Look at how shameful and regrettable this is. Everyone knows that Sichuan today can be said to have swept away discipline, leaving nothing behind. For example, when I came to Chongqing and Chengdu this time, I heard many people referring to the military and political officials in charge, not by their official ranks or positions, but by their names directly, and casually criticizing them. This is a phenomenon that is not seen in other provinces. From this point, it can also be seen that Sichuan today no longer knows what discipline is. It seems that everyone is used to being casual, and they have unknowingly become a trend, so that there is a lack of respect for the system between subordinates and colleagues, and the public in general does not have much respect for military and political officials. Everywhere, there are signs of decline and disorder. In fact, this is not right. It must be known that officials are appointed by the state. If you want to respect the country, you must respect the officials. Respecting officials means respecting the country. If the officials are not good, you can use legal procedures to appeal to their superior authorities and impose sanctions according to law. You cannot casually criticize them, openly despise them, or disregard the system of the country. Not only should subordinates treat their superiors in this way, but even superiors should not casually call their subordinates by their names directly. For example, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government is Comrade Huang Shaoxiong, but when I return to my hometown in Zhejiang, I am just one of the people under his jurisdiction. I cannot casually call him by his name. I should still call him Chairman like other people. This is how the country's system should be. Now, if we want to govern Sichuan, we should start by restoring people's hearts and changing customs. The most important point is to rectify discipline. Whether it is the literary or military, whether it is the agricultural, industrial, commercial, or academic circles, men, women, old, or young, everyone must abide by their duties, abide by discipline, follow the rules, know etiquette, and abide by the law. Then, discipline can be established, and Sichuan can be turned from chaos to order, and the country can be saved from this. Otherwise, if everyone does not wake up and still disrespect each other and abandon discipline, then the political, military, and social affairs will never be cleared up. Not only will Sichuan face imminent chaos and destruction, but the entire country will never have a chance to be revitalized. In short, the words I have spoken to everyone these few times, from beginning to end, are the essential ways for our officials, armies, and leaders from all walks of life, to save ourselves and the country. Everyone should be vigilant in time, strive to rise up, and do everything in accordance with what I have said, in order to fulfill their own responsibilities and achieve the goal of self-salvation and saving the country. I have been in Chengdu for four weeks, and everyone has held four memorial weeks here. Every memorial week, we must recite the late President's will. In this time of crisis and survival, we must truly be a Chinese citizen and a revolutionary soldier. To do a great revolutionary cause, we must follow the last four sentences of the will: "Be diligent, be brave, be trustworthy, be loyal, be of one heart and one mind, and persevere to the end," to strive to struggle. These four sentences are the basic ways for us to be a person, succeed in our careers, save the country, and seek survival. We should not casually read it or listen to it and forget it. Everyone present, whether men or women, must examine ourselves carefully, believe firmly and practice diligently, and always put the broken and dangerous country in our hearts, and everyone should take the realization of the Three Principles of the People of saving the country and the revolution as their own responsibility, not avoid trouble, not hesitate to sacrifice, not care about personal interests, and not be afraid to correct mistakes, and wholeheartedly fight for the country's personality and the nation's survival. Only in this way can our country and nation have the hope of revival, and everyone can fulfill the responsibility of Sichuanese people to save Sichuan and the country, and not be ashamed of being filial sons of their parents, followers of the late President, and citizens of the Republic of China."

<p>Serious Flooding in Jiangxi Province, Houses Swept Away, No Hope for Early Rice Harvest, Transportation Cut Off, Dikes in Danger</p>
<p>(Jiujiang News) Since the beginning of summer, Jiangxi has experienced continuous rain, as cold as late autumn. Since the 18th, heavy rain has poured down, day and night. The Gan River, Xiu River, Rao River, Fu River, Yuan River, and Rui River all experienced mountain floods that erupted and rose rapidly. The Gan River's water level reached two zhang and one fen by the 25th, and the area along the river was a vast expanse of water, causing widespread flooding. Disasters were also reported in other areas one after another, especially in northern Jiangxi. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transportation Disrupted</p>
<p>The Nansun Railway, except for a section from Jiabu to Xiu River, was submerged for over one Chinese mile, with depths of up to one zhang. From the 26th to the 28th, all vehicles were suspended. The postal route from the Yangtze River to the province was also interrupted. The road from Gan to Zhejiang, Gan to Fujian, and Wenzhou and other sections had water depths of seven to eight feet. The Gan-Xiang Road, various sections of Gao'an, had roadbeds destroyed and bridges collapsed, and can only reach Liangjiadu. The Gan-Yue Road is impassable beyond Zhangshu. Most other roads are also impassable, causing losses of tens of thousands of yuan, and it will take at least half a month to restore the original state.</p>
<p>No Hope for Early Rice</p>
<p>In this province, counties along the river and lake, such as Xiushui and Yongxiu, had their fields completely submerged, seedlings rotten, and no harvest is expected. The losses have not been accurately estimated.</p>
<p>Houses and Rivers</p>
<p>According to reporter investigations, countless houses and livestock have been swept away in Xiushui. Yongxiu County's county seat has been turned into a vast expanse of water. Three of the five gates of Duchang County's city have been submerged. The situation in other areas is also too terrible to describe.</p>
<p>Rescuing People and Fighting Disasters</p>
<p>After receiving reports of disasters from various regions, the provincial government ordered the Maritime Public Security Bureau, the Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Relief Committee to supervise various counties to rescue disaster victims from danger and help with dike repairs.</p>
<p>Emergency Relief</p>
<p>The Provincial Relief Committee, the Red Swastika Society, and various charitable organizations have raised funds to purchase a large number of biscuits, matches, and medicines, which have been distributed by boat to various places. The Provincial Relief Committee also telegraphed the central government to report the flooding and request emergency relief. The original telegram stated, "Jiangxi has suffered eight years of banditry, and last year it suffered an unprecedented drought. The people are already extremely poor. Unexpectedly, in mid-March of this year, it suffered the first flood, and in May, it suffered the second flood. The counties in southern, western, eastern, and northern Jiangxi were a vast expanse of water, and most of the early rice harvest flowed away. This is the third flood. Areas along the river and lake have been turned into a vast expanse of water, and highways and bridges have been washed away completely. There is no hope for an early rice harvest, and livelihoods have been cut off. Please immediately allocate large sums of money to save these dying people in distress." (27th)</p>
<p>Serious Flooding in the West River in Guangdong Province, The Disaster is Unprecedented in Over a Decade, Dyke Breaches and Incalculable Losses</p>
<p>(Guangzhou News) Since the middle of this month, the West River in Guangdong has experienced severe flooding, and some embankments in various counties along the river have collapsed. In the submerged areas, the water level is as high as the eaves of houses. The scope and severity of the disaster are unprecedented in over a decade. In recent days, government agencies and organizations in the disaster-stricken counties have repeatedly telegraphed for urgent relief. The disaster situation in various counties is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Sihui County</p>
<p>The county's Baihewei, Huanggangwei, Longfuwei, and Dangxi, facing the brunt of the flood, collapsed first on the 11th. On the 20th, Mazhouwei, Hengwei, Yaoshawei, Cangfengwei, and Yong'anwei also collapsed in succession. Areas within the dikes have become completely flooded. Rice fields, miscellaneous grains, houses, and livestock have been almost completely lost. The Yaosha and Cangfeng dikes, in particular, had the most farmland, where the county's essence was concentrated. After the flood, disaster victims had nowhere to eat or sleep, and supported the old and carried the young, camping out on the mountain peaks. Countless houses collapsed in the Yaosha dike, and thousands of disaster victims are in dire straits, in a situation unprecedented in three hundred years.</p>
<p>Guangning County</p>
<p>As of the 22nd, the plains were a vast expanse of water, and fields and houses were submerged. The area from the Donglong Highway to the Old Tea Pavilion in the county was flooded, boundless. Along the way, only the tiled roofs of village houses were visible, and residents had fled. Boats passed over the roofs of houses. The Donglong Road was submerged for over ten days, with only the treetops and the tops of telephone poles visible. When the city was flooded, the water level reached over three zhang. Rice and miscellaneous grains in the county have been washed away by the flood. Disaster victims were crowded in high-lying areas, with goods piled up.</p>
<p>Gaoming County</p>
<p>The county's Fifth District, Chongbuwei, served as a barrier for over twenty villages, including Baisha. By the 22nd, the Baisha section of the dike could not be saved and was breached for dozens of zhang by the torrential flood. Over twenty villages within the dike were submerged. While the villagers were being relocated for rescue, on the 23rd and 24th, the county's Baihe and Sanzhou dikes were also collapsed by the rapid currents. Houses and rice fields were all swept away by the West River. Thousands of disaster victims are crying out for food. In addition, the Xiaoling Junzhou Dasha Nan'an Temple dike is also in danger. Disaster victims are fleeing from the water, and hungry people are everywhere.</p>
<p>Gaoyao County</p>
<p>Gaoyao County, which is Zhaoqing City, has the Zhaoqing Gorge and Yang Gorge in the West River to contain the water flow. As a result, the West River flood became more rapid. Rapid currents broke through the county's various dikes without exception. Yanzhouwei collapsed first on the morning of the 23rd. On the 24th, it was followed by Touxiwei, Chentangwei, Etangtuan, and Xiangshantuan. The landscape was a vast expanse of water, with dozens of villages and over ten thousand residents displaced. Countless livestock were lost. Disaster victims were camping out on dike surfaces or mountain ridges, without food for days, and the sound of crying shook the sky. The old and weak were waiting for death. The disaster area spanned hundreds of li, and all fields, houses, fish ponds, and fruit trees were destroyed, causing losses of over one million yuan. The Chixiangwei Changliguo is currently in danger. In addition to preparing 15,000 jin of white rice for distribution, the county government has telegraphed various parties to provide relief quickly.</p>
<p>Sanshui County</p>
<p>Sanshui is the confluence of the lower reaches of the West River. When the West River's torrential flood surged down, Sanshui Ganzhuwei was first breached. As a result, the flood overflowed, and the water level in the Pingdi area of the Hekou southwest was several feet high. The Guangsan Hekou station was also submerged, and trains were unable to reach it for two days. On the 23rd, a breach was also discovered in the county's Chenggongwei. Fortunately, the villagers tried their best to rescue it, and the defense forces also helped. It was only safe the next morning. The county's Qianwei also showed signs of danger. Fortunately, burlap bags and stones had been purchased and stored in advance. The villagers and the soldiers of the 4th Regiment of the Training Division stationed in the area kept watch at night. Whenever there was a small breach, they would sound the gong to gather the crowd and block it together. By the 24th, the dike had escaped the dangerous period. Fortunately, after the 24th, the weather cleared up, and the scorching sun caused the flood to recede quickly. The Guangsan Railway train services have now resumed normal operations to Hekou.

<p>Leftover News After the Fengtai Rioters Attacked Beijing and Were Defeated, The Ring Leader Bai Jianwu Definitely Escaped to Tianjin, The Captured Rioters Are Being Interrogated</p>
<p>(Beijing News) After the Fengtai rioters attacked Beijing and were defeated, the Beijing city immediately established a martial law headquarters, and the entire 37th Division of the 29th Army, under Feng Zhian, was also stationed in the suburbs of Beijing. Therefore, the security of Beijing city has become increasingly consolidated, and people's hearts have also stabilized. The current task of the authorities is to prevent future problems, so they have ordered the military and police to cooperate in searching for the escaped rioters. Approximately, martial law at night can be lifted in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The authorities have offered a reward for the arrest of the rioter ringleader, Bai Jianwu, whose whereabouts are extremely secretive. During the incident on the morning of the 28th of last month, Bai was indeed hiding in the Six Nations Hotel in Dongjiaominxiang. When he heard that the disturbance had been quelled, he realized that his conspiracy had failed and was greatly frustrated. On the night of the 30th of last month, he sneaked out of Beijing and went to Tianjin.</p>
<p>From the 28th of last month to today (the 2nd), the number of suspicious persons hiding in Beijing city who have been captured by detectives is not small. For those with minor circumstances and guarantors, the authorities have shown mercy and given them leniency outside the law, considering that they were blindly following. However, the rioters captured near the suburbs of Tongzhou, up to today (the 2nd), have been handed over to the Weishu Command of Beijing for interrogation in three batches. The first batch of 92 people were captured in Xianghe, the second batch of 2 people were key figures, and the third batch of 18 people, totaling 112 people. Their attire was all white shirts and black pants, which was the clothing stipulated before the rioters started the incident, with the intention of recognizing each other during the disturbance.</p>
<p>Regarding the rioters handed over to Beijing for disposal, according to sources from the Wei Shu Command, they are currently submitting a request to the Military Branch Committee for approval. It is said that, in general, those who were truly blindly following can be expected to be given a chance to reform, while the key figures are undoubtedly guilty of unforgivable crimes. It is rumored that Duan Chunze, the captain of the armored vehicle team who defected, is among the key figures. Reporters inquired from various parties and all said that there was no such person. However, it is said that two key criminals, escorted to Beijing this afternoon (the 2nd), have been executed, but this has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>After the Fengtai riot failed due to a failed conspiracy, and they scattered after the "war zone," the number of casualties, in addition to those killed and captured along the way, is roughly small. In order to seek public peace, the authorities are still very nervous about preventive work. The city's police and security forces are in high spirits. Although the special duties of the past few days have been extremely arduous, they have not shown any signs of fatigue. Therefore, the authorities have specially allocated funds to reward them, in order to encourage them. (July 2)</p>
<p>Chairman Shang Zhen of Hebei Province Will Take Office in Baoding Soon, The Provincial Government and Various Departments Have Completed Their Closing Matters, Wei Jian Returned to Baoding to Handle the Handover Procedures of the Provincial Government, The Magistrates of Fifteen Counties Including Xingtai Were Replaced</p>
<p>(Baoding News) The new Chairman of Hebei Province, Shang Zhen, is scheduled to come to Baoding from Beijing on the 5th to take office. The newly appointed Provincial Committee and Civil Affairs Director Li Peiji, concurrent Finance Director Li Jingrong, concurrent Construction Director Lu Xian, concurrent Education Director He Hongji, and Provincial Committee members Zhang Yinwu, Liang Ziqing, Liu Yinan, and Nan Guixin have been officially announced by the central government. Except for Nan Guixin, who expressed his inability to take office due to physical weakness, all the others will come to Baoding with Shang to take office at the same time. Regarding the reorganization of the provincial government, now that the responsible persons of each department have been appointed, all improvements in affairs and whether there will be changes in the internal organization must be decided after Chairman Shang comes to Baoding. Since the central government issued the order to reorganize the provincial government, the various departments below the provincial government have been rushing to complete their closing matters. As of July 2, it has largely come to an end. The former Civil Affairs Director Zhang Houwan, Finance Director Lu Muting, Construction Director Hu Yuanhui, and Education Director Zheng Daoru are all staying in Baoding to wait for the handover in person. Provincial Government Secretary-General Wei Jian returned to Baoding from Beijing yesterday. All closing matters of the provincial government are being supervised by Wei, and Wei will be responsible for the handover responsibilities of the provincial government in the future. The heads of various departments here believe that provincial affairs have been stalled for a long time and urgently need Chairman Shang to come</p>

<p>Regarding the Kidnapping on the Jiahe Steamer, Two Crew Members, Shen and Ge, are Safe; Guangzhou Merchant Shipping Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Escort Them Back to Shanghai; Li Xiaobin is Still Missing.</p>
<p>The Jiahe Steamer of the State-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was hijacked by pirates on November 4th of last year, and three crew members were kidnapped. The company recently received a telegram from its Guangzhou branch reporting that Shen Qinxiang and Ge Liangchen have been rescued and are safe, but Li Xiaobin is still missing. Guangdong military police are continuing their search and suppression efforts. The detailed information obtained is as follows:</p>
<p>Kidnapping Incident</p>
<p>The Jiahe Steamer, operating on the Shanghai-Guangdong route for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was hijacked by pirates in Dapeng Bay on the morning of November 4th of last year. At that time, in addition to looting property, they also killed a police officer, Yang Zetian, and kidnapped the ship's business director Shen Qinxiang, accountant Ge Liangchen, and purser Li Xiaobin. After the incident occurred, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, which forwarded it to the Executive Yuan, ordering Guangdong military police to strictly investigate. On the 10th of last month, Chen Shenrong, the police officer stationed at Dapeng Bay, with information provided, captured Chen Yaxun, the ringleader of the pirates who hijacked the ship, in Shi Fang Village. However, the hostages had not yet been rescued.</p>
<p>Rescue and Escape</p>
<p>Although the garrison troops stationed at Dapeng Bay captured the pirate leader, they continued their efforts to search and suppress the pirates. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently received a telegram from the Guangzhou branch reporting that after intensifying the search and suppression of the pirates, two more pirates were captured on the 1st of this month, and the hostages Shen Qinxiang and Ge Liangchen were rescued. Li Xiaobin is still missing, and his fate is unknown.</p>
<p>Escort Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the Guangdong branch, the Shanghai General Bureau of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company replied, ordering the branch to dispatch personnel to escort Shen Qinxiang and Ge Liangchen back to Shanghai. The families of the two men have also received the news and are very happy.

<p>The Produce Guild Sends a Letter Requesting an End to Illegal Organizations That Specialize in Intercepting Hakka Fruits, Otherwise Demanding Six Dollars per Boat</p>
<p>The Shanghai Produce Guild has recently reported that unscrupulous individuals have formed large groups and stationed themselves at various key waterways and roads in western Shanghai, intercepting Hakka fruits and forcing merchants to pay fees, hindering their journeys. Yesterday, the guild sent separate letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various public security agencies on land and water, requesting protection. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, according to reports from all colleagues in the Hongqiao, Caojiadu, Lao Zha, Xin Zha, and Tou Zha districts of our guild, recently, unscrupulous individuals have established business names, gathered many people, and formed large groups. They are scattered in various locations, guarding waterways and roads in Hongqiao, Caojiadu, Yujidun, and Beixinjing in western Shanghai, specializing in forcibly seizing Hakka fruits. It is also heard that if Hakka merchants wish to avoid detention, they must pay a donation of six dollars per boat. Furthermore, it is rumored that this organization has been approved by certain authorities. As watermelons are about to enter the market, if such illegal organizations exist, they will greatly harm our industry's operations and severely disturb the journeys of merchants. Therefore, we specifically request that you take measures to provide relief in advance." Upon investigation, the buying and selling of goods in our industry has always been based on the willingness of merchants, and forced transactions are prohibited, as they constitute a violation of the criminal law against freedom. According to the information reported by various colleagues, if these situations are factual, these unscrupulous elements are disregarding the law. Their criminal acts include (1) robbery, (2) infringement of others' freedom, (3) fraud, and (4) encroachment on the authority of administrative agencies. If preventive measures are not taken, the harm to society will be significant. Moreover, as melon and fruit products will soon enter the market, the matter is urgent. In order to prevent problems before they arise, our guild specifically requests that your chamber urgently forward this letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering the local land and water authorities in western Shanghai to investigate such organizations and order the police to implement measures to stop illegal activities, make every effort to arrest them, and refer them to judicial authorities for punishment. At the same time, protect the journeys of merchants to maintain public order and deter unlawful activities. This is a matter of public interest.</p>

<p>Alas, a Pregnant Woman Dies Tragically from Poisoning; Doctor's Efforts to Save Her Fail; Infant Also Dies in the Womb</p>
<p>A Guangdong widow, Ms. He Xu, 30 years old, lived with her paramour, He Liang, a former cook, at No. 283 Tongzhou Road. Due to their impoverished circumstances, ten days ago, Ms. He argued with He Liang after he refused to give her money. He then left in anger and did not return. On the 1st of this month, He returned with his mother to Ms. He's residence to collect clothes, which led to another argument on the way. The police were called, and all three were taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. After a brief interrogation, the head of the police station, considering the matter to be minor, offered some consolation and released them. Unexpectedly, the night before last, Ms. He, unable to pay the rent for her residence, went to her friend Li Caidi to borrow money but was unsuccessful. She then tearfully said goodbye and returned home, feeling increasingly resentful. She suddenly had a suicidal thought and bought opium to swallow and kill herself. At around 1:00 AM yesterday, Li Caidi went to Ms. He's residence to check on her and discovered what had happened. She immediately reported it to the nearby police officer, who rushed her to the Shanghai Nursing Home. Ms. He was six or seven months pregnant. Despite the doctor's best efforts to save her, the poison had spread to her lungs, and she died at 3:00 AM. The doctor determined that the infant in her womb had also died 20 minutes later. The hospital reported the incident to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which ordered Detective Lü Shouchang to investigate. As He Liang's address was unknown, he could not be summoned. The police then transported Ms. He's body to the Jiaolun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After West Police Chief Wei Er reported the details, Tang ruled that the deceased, the pregnant woman Ms. He Xu, had indeed died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to the Pushan Shanzhuang for burial.</p>
<p>Aftermath of a Love Affair: Man Assaults Matchmaker; Gu Only Co-habits with Elder Sister; Mr. Gu Angered and Commits Violence</p>
<p>The late French Concession Police Detective Gu Jisheng owned assets worth millions during his lifetime. He owned a residence at No. 14 Pingji Li Road, but he lacked an heir. He adopted a son named Longgen, also known as Wei Yi. When Wei Yi grew up, he married the daughter of Mr. Weng Jinshan, the owner of Tianxing Pawnshop at the intersection of Wangzhi Road and Maling Road in the French Concession. After the marriage, they had several children. However, Wei Yi, after becoming prosperous, indulged in lust and had an affair with the hired maid, Gu Aiyuan. After several encounters, she became pregnant. Later, due to Wei Yi's abandonment, Gu Aiyuan, after the death of Gu Jisheng, hired a lawyer in the early winter of last year to sue Gu Wei Yi for abandonment in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Lu Zhonglian intervened to mediate, and Gu Wei Yi paid 1,000 gold to settle the matter, bringing the incident to an end. Recently, Gu Aiyuan's two-year-old son, Huogen, has been frequently ill. To seek a speedy recovery for the child, she and her co-habitant, Wu Du, (36 years old, from Suzhou, notes that Du is Gu Jisheng's adopted daughter, referred to Wei Yi as an elder sister and younger brother), discussed and planned to register the child as a son of the Immortal Master of Shangfang Mountain. Therefore, on May 31st, at 11:00 AM, Aiyuan, with her nanny Xiao Lu, carrying the child, accompanied by Wu Du, went to Shangfang Mountain Immortal Master Hall next to the Tianxing Pawnshop (Wei Yi's in-laws) at the intersection of Maling Road and Wangzhi Road to burn incense. Unexpectedly, Gu Weng saw them just as they arrived at the entrance of the Buddhist hall. Feeling that Weng had completely orchestrated her husband Wei Yi's initial affair with Aiyuan, she was filled with jealousy. She rushed forward to fight Du, and passersby dispersed them. Wu Du suffered injuries all over her body from Weng's assault. She hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Gu Weng, Weng's mother, Weng Lao Tai, younger sister Weng Shi Zi, and others of assault, requesting an investigation. The court, based on the complaint, summoned them to the Criminal Division 2 for questioning yesterday morning by Judge Qiu Huan Ying. First, the plaintiff Wu Du recounted the circumstances of the assault, claiming that on that day, she and Gu Aiyuan went to the entrance and were assaulted by the defendants and more than ten shop assistants, regardless of the circumstances. The witness, Gu Aiyuan and the nanny Xiao Lu, testified to everything. Gu Weng claimed that she returned home that day to visit her sick mother and did not dare to commit violence when she saw Du asking for overdue payments. Weng Lao Tai claimed that she was 65 years old, sick, and bedridden, and unable to fight anyone, requesting permission to file a counterclaim for false accusation. Xiao Shi Zi claimed that she was holding the young master that day and could not help in the fight, requesting consideration. The defendants jointly hired lawyers Wang Heng and Gu to defend them. After arguments from both sides' lawyers, the court announced the conclusion of the hearing and scheduled sentencing for the 9th.</p>
<p>Record of the Song Sutra Pavilion</p>
<p>The Buddhist movement in Hangzhou, with a thorough understanding of faith as its core, Lawyer Wu Manlin, purchased a set of the Song Dynasty Qisha Edition Sutra, published by the Song Edition Sutra Association at No. 714 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai, which is solemn and exquisite, together with a wooden box, and sent it to the Pan An Back Hall on Yangpan Bridge Middle Street, Jianggan, Hangzhou City. Master Haelin built a large sutra pavilion to enshrine and worship it. Layman Zhang Zaiyang recently wrote a pavilion record, which describes it in detail. The text reads: "Pan's family nunnery is an ancient temple in Jiangqian, Hangzhou. It has famous masters residing there. Since Haelin took over this mantle, he vowed to practice diligently. Last summer, Layman Wu Manlin purchased the entire collection of the Song Dynasty Qisha Edition Sutra, totaling 1,521 types and 6,310 volumes. This autumn, the sutra arrived, and Haelin built this pavilion to house it, naming it the Great Sutra Pavilion to show that the pavilion was built because of the sutra."</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiheng and Other Ships Begin Selling Hong Kong Passenger Tickets; Hong Kong Passenger Licenses Will Be Obtained Upon Departure to the South</p>
<p>After the Hong Kong authorities permitted ships piloted by Chinese crew members to issue passenger licenses starting July 1st, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has begun to obtain licenses from the Hong Kong authorities and sell Hong Kong tickets. It is noted that the company's ships operating on the Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong route are the Haiyuan, Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen. Except for the Haiyuan, where the master is L.J. Johannessen, and the chief mate, chief engineer, and chief mate are all Westerners, having already obtained Hong Kong passenger licenses, the master of the Haiheng, Ma Jiajun, the master of the Haili, Teng Shibiao, and the master of the Haizhen, Hu Xiyuan, are all Chinese crew members. It has now been decided that starting today, they will obtain licenses on their first voyages to Hong Kong, and will begin selling Hong Kong passenger tickets upon their return to Shanghai. For example, the Haiheng is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Guangdong via Hong Kong on the 6th, at which time it will obtain a Hong Kong license. As the Haiyuan sailed to Guangdong yesterday and already had a Hong Kong passenger license, it did not need to obtain another one. It is rumored that the ship carried Hong Kong passengers for the first time, which is incorrect.</p>
<p>Near Gaochang Temple, a Child Was Buried Alive in the River; The Child's Name Was Su Xiaogouzi; He Died Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Gaochang Temple branch of the Ximen branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau reported at 6:00 PM the night before last that a police officer from the station discovered a human head in the mud of the river behind the nearby Zilaihuo Factory. Deeply surprised at the time, he immediately reported to the station and summoned several senior police officers to investigate. They immediately tried to approach the location of the human head. Unexpectedly, the result was a completely child's body, about ten years old. Except for the head, the whole body was buried in the mud. There were two knife wounds on the corner of the left eye and the back of the head, with bloodstains. Obviously, he was murdered and abandoned there. However, it was observed that his body was not yet cold, and his heart was still beating. He was rushed to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the family was investigated. It was not until yesterday morning that a woman went to the Ximen branch, claiming to be Su Chen, 45 years old, from Xinghua, Jiangbei. She currently lives on a scow boat in Huayuan Port. Because her son, Su Xiaogouzi, 14 years old, made a living by scavenging, he did not return all night last night (the night before last). Now that she had heard of this case, she was afraid that it was her son, Xiaogouzi. Director Li immediately ordered the police to accompany the woman to Shanghai Hospital. When they arrived, the child was indeed her son, Xiaogouzi, but he had only a breath left and said nothing. Therefore, there was no way to find out the beginning and end of his murder. Until about 1:00 PM, he eventually died in the hospital due to his injuries. The hospital notified the Ximen branch and transferred the order to the local guarantor to report to the local court for inspection. Director Li immediately ordered his subordinates to strictly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice for trial.</p>
<p>Falling Off the Bed Results in Death</p>
<p>Zhou Xianting, 48 years old, from Shandong, was a businessman in Guangdong. On the 24th of last month, he came to Shanghai from Guangdong by boat and stayed at Room 28 of the Dean Inn at No. 257 Minguo Road in the French Concession. At 4:00 AM yesterday, he fell off the bed for unknown reasons, causing a head injury. The porter discovered it and reported it to the police station, who rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He died at 6:00 AM. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the morgue of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. The Second Special District Court was then notified, and Judge Wu, on the 5th, was commissioned to examine the body. It was determined that the deceased had indeed died from a fall. As there were no family members in Shanghai, the court ordered the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to bury the body and wait for family members to claim it. All the deceased's belongings were ordered to be sent to the court for safekeeping and posted for claiming.</p>
<p>The Third Trial Concludes, Maintaining the Original Sentence; Lawyer Yan Luqing Will Be Imprisoned; The Supreme Court Has Returned the Judgment; The Third High Court Summons Yan Luqing for Execution</p>
<p>Lawyer Yan Luqing, 40 years old, a local, joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member in August of the 19th year of the Republic and practiced law in Shanghai, setting up an office on the second floor of No. 49 Sichuan Road. On June 9th of last year, Zhou Jinggeng, the comprador of the Xue Mairuo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Aiduya Road, had 12,000 yuan in cash stolen. Zhang Zuming, a shareholder of Ruichangshun Hardware Store, Zhuang Jimeng, a young master of Zhuangyuan Great Wine Shop, Wang Lianyou, a runner of a foreign hardware company, and Tang Qingyue, the director of Dade Hospital, were implicated. The French Police Department arrested and brought them to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Yan Luqing was entrusted by the plaintiff Zhou Jinggeng to appear in court to file a civil lawsuit to recover the stolen losses. Later, Yan, together with Zhou, took the opportunity to threaten the family of Tang Qingyue and extorted 2,000 yuan as compensation for the losses. At the same time, they attempted to defraud the families of Zhang and Zhuang, the two defendants, of 60,000 yuan but failed. The families reported to the French Police Department, accusing Yan of threatening and extorting money. Upon hearing the news, Yan and Zhou returned the 2,000 yuan received from Tang's family. After investigation by the Police Department, a public prosecution was filed with the Second Special District Court in accordance with Article 370 of the Criminal Code. After the trial concluded, on July 28th of the same year, Yan Luqing was sentenced to two years and six months in prison and fined 800 yuan for jointly and continuously intending to illegally possess other people's property by threatening them to hand over their belongings, depriving him of public rights for five years. If he was unable to pay the fine, it would be converted into imprisonment at a rate of three yuan per day. As Yan did not accept the judgment, he appealed to the Third Branch Court of the High Court. As a result, the appeal was rejected. Yan still did not accept it and filed a third-instance appeal with the Supreme Court in Nanjing, hoping to obtain a final reduction of the sentence. Unexpectedly, the Supreme Court has now concluded the trial and still ruled to reject the appeal, maintaining the original sentence. The Third High Court received the case file and judgment returned by the Supreme Court a few days ago. Yesterday, the High Court issued the judgment to the judicial police to serve on the appellant, i.e., the defendant Yan Luqing. He will be summoned for execution soon. As for Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, the French Police Department expressed dissatisfaction with the two-instance judgment of acquittal and requested the prosecutor of the Third High Court to file an appeal with the Supreme Court. Zhou Jinggeng, the plaintiff, also filed a civil appeal against the rejection of the civil suit in two instances. It has not yet been judged, but it is expected to be soon.</p>

It is said that the deceased's name was Wang Zhaochang, from Haimen, Jiangsu, only 16 years old. He currently lived at No. 12 Dongtingshan Lane, Guanzhao Bridge, Nanshi, Shanghai. The reason for his suicide was very minor. During his working hours, he accidentally damaged the glass of a window display, and was criticized slightly by the director. However, due to his temporary anger, he committed suicide by jumping into the sea, which was unexpected.</p>
<p>The Yulin Road Police Station Shot Four Robbers to Death; Examination of the Bodies</p>
<p>Yulin Road Police Station, Chinese Detective Tang Jian, Yang Peisheng, Detective Li Pengfei, Zhao Ziren, Xie Wanfang, Detective Jin Meirong, and Western Detectives, etc., at about 7:00 PM the night before last, detected that there were robbers hiding on the front building of No. 156 Pingliang Road, so they went to the place to arrest them. The two sides fought, and as a result, the four robbers were shot and killed by the detectives. Detective Jin and two passers-by were also shot and are currently receiving medical treatment. Yesterday morning, the bodies of the four robbers were sent to the Philen Road Morgue by the detectives. At 10:00 AM, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and Secretary Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the bodies one by one. First, the Western Police Chief Shi Diwenshi reported the circumstances, and said that one of the four robbers had been identified by fingerprints as Wei Jinfu, 20 years old, from Shaoxing. He was arrested by the police in January of this year for gambling and sentenced by the court to a fine of eight yuan. Two of the robbers went to Ding Wan's and Ding Ni's house at No. 14 Zhaoqing Lane, Dengtuo Road, on the 20th of last month with weapons and robbed jewelry and silver dollars, totaling more than 1,000 yuan. The victims have been summoned to the morgue to identify them correctly and requested that the four bodies be kept for one night for burial. The police station plans to summon other victims of the robbery to come and identify whether the robbers have committed other robberies. Detective Li Pengfei reported that at about 4:00 PM yesterday, the police station received a report from an informant about the robbers' hideout and their plan to go out to rob that night. The police station sent detectives to arrest them. When Jin detective first went upstairs, he saw four robbers having dinner. When the other detectives rushed up from behind and ordered them to be arrested, one of the robbers stood up and fired a gun at Jin detective. The other detectives also fired back, killing them. Tang then determined that the deceased, Wei Jinfu, male, and three unnamed men were shot and killed while resisting arrest. No family members were found. The bodies were handed over to the Pushan Shanzhuang for burial. The three bullets recovered from the bodies were handed over to the police station in charge for investigation.</p>
<p>Selling Red Pills with Mysterious Actions; Detective Designs to Crack the Case; A Total of Five Men and Women Were Arrested and Remanded for Sentencing on a Scheduled Date</p>
<p>Wang Asi from Chongming and Zhang Mingshan from Wuxi secretly sold potent red pills for profit in a house at No. 114, Lane 59, North Jiangxi Road. Hua Detectives Pan Ximan and Wang Runhe of the Hongkou Police Station learned of this and at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday, disguised as customers and went to buy the pills with 15 yuan in marked bills, contacting Wang and Zhang. He ordered Detective Wang to wait outside the door. Knowing that Wang had mysterious methods and must have hidden the red pills elsewhere, he would follow to see where they were taken and throw a piece of paper out the window as a signal. As expected, Wang and Zhang told Detective Pan to wait a moment, took the money, and Zhang's wife, Yu, entertained him with tea. Wang and Zhang hurriedly went out. Detective Pan showed the note to Detective Wang, who followed silently, step by step, and saw them enter the house at No. 329 Shanxi Road. After a while, Zhou Liugen from Pudong went elsewhere alone, and returned after about half an hour. Wang and Zhang came out quickly and went home calmly. Detective Wang and others checked carefully and still followed behind, and then went inside. Zhang Mingshan took out two packs of red pills, weighing one pound in total, and handed them to Detective Pan for inspection, and then arrested him. Wang and Zhang knew that they had been tricked and bowed their heads in silence. Two yuan and four jiao of the original banknotes were found in Zhang's socks. He rushed to No. 329 Shanxi Road, and continued to arrest Zhou Liugen. After questioning, he found out that the red pills were bought from Qin Fugen, from Changshu, No. 145 Racecourse. He arrested Qin and seized the drug delivery, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang of the Public Works Department detailed the previous situation and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, requesting strict punishment, and said that the defendant Qin Fugen said in the police station that the red pills were from Liang Yi, who lived in the French Concession, and he only got eight jiao for the delivery. Then, Detective Pan reported on the process of solving the case, and presented the red pills and the lead kettle for inspection. When questioned, the defendants stammered and said that this kind of illegal thing had only been done for 15 days, and begged for forgiveness. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded for a scheduled sentencing.</p>
<p>Lawyer Le Junfen Sues Minghua Bank for Fraud; Summons Not Received; Will Be Served by Public Notice</p>
<p>Lawyer Le Junfen has had check dealings with Beijing Road Minghua Bank for several years. On May 24 of this year, the bank suddenly announced its closure and appointed lawyer Wei Jiong and accountant Wu to take care of it indefinitely. Lawyer Le had check dealings with the bank, and his deposit of 179.89 yuan was also forfeited. Although he negotiated, the bank was unable to repay even this small amount. Lawyer Le then hired lawyer Le Junying to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing the chairman of Minghua Bank, Tong Jinhui, directors Zhang Gangbo, Tong Guangfu, Zhang Erqing, Zhang Yifei, Yu Yueting, Lin Zhenhu, supervisors Zhou Zijing, and Song Fuchen of joint fraud. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Zhaoxin came to the Criminal Court 8 to summon them for questioning, but the summonses of the defendants were returned because lawyer Wei Jiong refused to accept them on their behalf, so none of the defendants arrived at the trial. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that they be served by public notice, and said that the Minghua Bank opened by the defendants usually absorbed small deposits for the defendants to squander, and then announced its liquidation when the time came, and even deposits of hundreds of yuan could not be repaid, which was a fraudulent act. Judge Yang ordered that the case be scheduled for August 10 for service by public notice.</p>

<p>After the Robbery, the Robbers Lost the Stolen Money; They Dared to Sneak Back to Look for It; They Were Spotted by a Shop Assistant and Reported; Two Robbers Were Chased and Caught on the Spot</p>
<p>Zhang Chongkun, from Rugao, 51 years old, has been in Shanghai for many years and runs a rickshaw rental company at No. 7, Lane 38, Sangyuan Street, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. At first, the scale was very small, but because Zhang was good at management, it has now expanded to more than 40 vehicles. The daily income is quite considerable. Zhang's wife, Chen, Zhang's mother-in-law, Zhao, and Zhang's children all live in the company. Unexpectedly, this attracted the attention of bandits. At about 10:30 the night before last, six bandits with Jiangbei accents, wearing short clothes of varying shades of blue and black, suddenly came and showed their guns. At that time, Zhang had gone to Nanyang Hospital in Xiaodongmen for treatment and had not returned. After the bandits entered, one bandit guarded the gate, and five bandits broke into the inner room, confining Zhang's family in an empty space, and then looted separately, searching through boxes and cabinets. A total of 50 yuan in banknotes (which were wrapped in a paper bag), 11 yuan and 2 jiao in cash, 90 jiao in double coins, a gold ring worn by Zhang's wife, Chen, earrings, and many new Ge cloth shoes were stolen. After the bandits obtained the stolen goods, they rushed out the door and fled towards Sanmeili Lane and Lujiabang. At that time, Zhang's mother-in-law, Zhang, hurriedly followed the bandits and shouted for the capture of the bandits. A bandit hurriedly fired two shots to warn her, but fortunately no one was injured. However, the bandits were so anxious at this point that they threw a pair of new shoes they had robbed at the entrance of Lane 38. Unexpectedly, in a hurry, they also dropped the 50 yuan in banknotes in the paper bag on the ground. At that time, they did not notice it at all. Before long, the police officers in charge of Xundao Street heard the alarm and hurriedly dispatched Inspector Chen Xuemin to lead Sergeant Wang Zuogui, Zhang Hongzhu, and Police Officer Zhou Qingdao to pursue and arrest them. However, because it was too late, the bandits had disappeared, and they were not caught. Later, Sergeant Zhang Hongxun suddenly discovered the 50 yuan in banknotes and a pair of shoes dropped by the bandits at the entrance of Lane 38, and immediately took them back to the station with him. Unexpectedly, after the bandits escaped, they suddenly discovered that the 50 yuan in banknotes they had robbed had been lost in the vicinity of the entrance of Lane 38. The bandits were so greedy for money that they refused to give up, so at about 4:00 AM yesterday, when the sky was just dawn and there were few pedestrians on the road, they sent their accomplices Zhou Yinglong and Wang Zongcai to sneak to the entrance of the lane to search, hoping to recover the stolen goods and divide them up. Unexpectedly, Qin Meihua, a shop assistant in Zhang Chongkun's rickshaw apartment, spotted them and paid attention to them. After a while, Zhou and others returned westward after searching without success. Qin immediately followed them. When they reached Puyu West Road, he secretly reported to the guard, Sun Baoming, at Post 20. He immediately chased them and arrested the two bandits, Zhou and Wang, and took them to the Wenmiao Road Police Station in charge, and then transferred them to the Xundao Street Police Station. It was found next to Zhou Yinglong a sign of the third platoon, ninth class deputy squad leader of the South Shanghai District Security Regiment, but the name Zhou Yinglong on the sign looked like it had been tampered with. During questioning by Director Jin of the station, Wang Zongcai confessed that he was 26 years old, from Yancheng, and formerly lived in a thatched shed on Guohuo Road. Zhou Yinglong confessed that he was 22 years old, from Shandong, and formerly lived at No. 5, Lane 41, Jiangyin Street. He also confessed the whereabouts of his accomplices, Wang Chao and others. The station is now dispatching police to investigate.</p>
<p>Defamation; Teacher and Student Involved in a Court Case; Shi Shuanghu Sues Song Hongfu; Song Vigorously Denies the Attack</p>
<p>Physician Shi Shuanghu, from Fujian, opened a modern scientific beauty hospital on the second floor of the Women's Bank on Nanjing Road. He recently hired a lawyer to sue Song Hongfu, a Ningbo native who is the director of the Shanghai Beauty Hospital of the Mainland Shopping Mall, for defamation and other crimes in the First Special District Court. The facts are that Song was studying medicine with him, and his three-year term was about to expire. After studying for a year, when the Municipal Health Bureau held a physician registration, Shi, at Song's request, issued a graduation certificate to go for registration. Because it was not a formal hospital certificate, it was not approved. Later, with Shi's help, he set up the Shanghai Beauty Hospital. Recently, Miss Chen, who lives on Ladu Road, had a mole on her forehead. She was first treated by Song, and then by Shi. Song then repeatedly attacked Shi in various ways at Chen's place, which Shi learned about. He then sent a letter to Song, asking him to return the graduation certificate he had issued. Unexpectedly, after receiving the letter, Song invited many people to Shi's residence and clinic to make a lot of noise. Shi then filed a lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the Criminal Court 2 for questioning. Song hired lawyer Dai Ji'en to defend him. First, Shi recounted the process. Then Song claimed that he and Shi had gone from friends to teacher and student. This time, I had never said bad things about Mr. Shi in front of Miss Chen. Perhaps someone was instigating things. Shi then sent a letter to me, wanting to get back the certificate, and his words were very fierce. Because it was a misunderstanding, I went to Shi's residence with two friends to prepare for an explanation. Unexpectedly, Shi refused and asked me to go to his clinic for negotiations at 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>National Goods Weekly, Shen Bao. National Goods Movement in Drinks by Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, reports stated that the Italian government, because the country's tea and coffee production was insufficient to meet its own needs, while wine production was very high, was making every effort to persuade its citizens to replace tea and coffee with Italian-produced wine. This news seemed unremarkable, but the Italians' promotion of national goods was vividly demonstrated on paper. We Chinese, who love to drink foreign wine, foreign soda, and foreign drinks, should we not feel ashamed?</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter day by day, and the sales of drinks are increasing day by day. The waiters in the taverns and the helpers in the restaurants will once again be happily pouring foreign drinks for foreign companies. Bottle after bottle, cup after cup, they only know that the more bottles they sell, the more profit they make. They don't care whether it's a national product or not, whether it's beneficial or not. They have never had such a concept of national goods in their minds. Their conscience has long been stained black. We ourselves should be clear and quickly treat our mouths as small customs checkpoints, vowing not to let in a single drop of foreign drinks, and then they will have no way to use their tricks. We also don't need to blame them. The most hateful thing is the general *modeng* (modern) young men and women, born with a cheap bone, a traitorous slave's heart. They clearly have national drinks available, but they insist on drinking foreign wine, foreign soda, and foreign drinks, thinking it's fashionable. The helpers then cater to this kind of bad psychology and desperately sell foreign drinks. The helpers are indeed pitiful and regrettable, but these *modeng* young men and women are even more hateful and deserving of being killed. There are also some muddled helpers who sell foreign goods as Chinese goods, often tricking patriotic people into falling for their tricks. Look at the drinks on the market labeled with Chinese brands, eight or nine out of ten are probably unreliable. Alas, we are all citizens of the same country, why is there such a great difference in our levels of awareness? "It is precisely the endless drinking of wine and water that leads to national ruin and family destruction right before our eyes."</p>
<p>Wake up, everyone, and let us work together to promote this national goods movement in drinks. How to Save the Huge Import Surplus by Ba Ling</p>
<p>Recently, various newspapers have unanimously published a piece of news that causes sorrow to those who read it. Its title is: "Our country relies on foreign goods for clothing, food, housing, and transportation, requiring more than 400 million yuan annually." After reading this title, I carefully read the entire article and discovered that in just five months, Shanghai alone relies on foreign goods for clothing, food, housing, and transportation, reaching over 63.63 million gold units. Other places are not included in this calculation. What a huge leak! Now, the import surplus statistics for the four categories of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are copied below to show a glimpse of the enormous quantities:</p>
<p>Clothing – Totaling 22,393,766 gold units.</p>
<p>Food – Totaling 16,632,362 gold units.</p>
<p>Housing – Totaling 20,373,323 gold units.</p>
<p>Transportation – Totaling 4,233,937 gold units.</p>
<p>The above four items total 63,630,388 gold units, accounting for 43.8% of Shanghai's total imports in five months. This is something that deserves our attention," etc. (Excerpt from this newspaper on the 20th of last month)</p>
<p>After seeing this news, I wonder what feelings arise? At a time when the call for promoting national goods is being sung so passionately, the discovery of such a huge import surplus evokes even more feelings. I think that all compatriots with enthusiasm and vitality cannot help but feel something in their hearts, right?</p>
<p>How to save this huge leaking import surplus? How to gradually reduce the reliance on foreign goods for clothing, food, housing, and transportation? Naturally, there is no better way than to earnestly promote national goods! However, in my view, in order to gradually reduce this huge leak, and even completely eliminate it, promoting national goods is indeed the only way, but what is especially important is the construction of national psychology and the encouragement of the inventive spirit of creating national goods. Regarding the construction of national psychology, I have published many of my humble views in this publication in the past! I feel that the most effective way to promote national goods is for leaders to lead by example. In addition to this, we must rely on the power of education to cultivate a psychology of using national goods among the future masters of the country. However, this is a task that does not show immediate results, but it is still not to be ignored for the sake of the future of promoting national goods, right?</p>
<p>Secondly, we must talk about encouraging the invention of national goods. In recent years, there have been many Chinese people who have diligently studied and invented national goods. We often see news of the Ministry of Industry granting patents on the news, which is a good proof and also a good phenomenon for the future of national goods. However, in the face of this serious import surplus, I sincerely hope that the government authorities and people from all walks of life will give special attention and preferential treatment to inventors, so that they can use their minds and efforts to strive and sacrifice for national goods, because inventing national goods is also an effective way to resist foreign goods.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I personally feel that in order to save this huge import surplus, we should indeed start with the above two items. At the same time, for the sake of emergency, the government should also have an order to use national goods and stipulate that all agencies and civil servants must purchase and use national goods. If they do not comply, there should also be a corresponding penalty. Here, I feel that the Shanghai Student National Goods Promotion Committee's telegram to the National Government on June 2, requesting the reiteration of the order to use national goods, and the news reported on June 9 about the joint consultation between the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance on measures to use national goods, are worth mentioning here. We eagerly hope that the government authorities will implement it as soon as possible, because this is also a life-saving injection in the midst of a serious import surplus! How to Clean Up the Scoundrels in National Goods by Quan Jia</p>
<p>A few days ago, a friend surnamed Ying came from the inland. He inadvertently talked about the situation of national goods activities in the inland. He said: "In recent years, the national crisis has been so serious that people in the inland have indeed discovered their conscience. They all want to buy Chinese goods and change their long-standing habit of loving foreign goods. This is good news. However, some unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the people's psychology of loving national goods and secretly profiting from counterfeit national goods. On the one hand, they publicize extensively, as if those who do not buy goods from their stores cannot be considered enthusiastic patriots, but their own patriotic enthusiasm has long become cold-blooded. This is sad news."</p>
<p>Indeed, in recent years, in response to the need for national goods, there are indeed companies and stores that have been established to develop national goods. However, it cannot be said that there are no companies and stores that buy foreign goods, hang national goods trademarks, deceive people, and disrupt national goods. In order to wipe away the above-mentioned stains from the sacred "national goods," we must do the work of cleaning up the troublemakers. If the following three methods can be implemented diligently as I have said, then the scoundrels in national goods will not be difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding national goods organizations: When a national goods company or national goods store is established, it is best to have it reviewed by a national goods organization. If it is qualified, then everyone will unanimously recognize it as a national goods company. This method is like school registration, so that everyone cannot be deceived by it. Of course, the review must be detailed, and the national goods organization that conducts the review must have considerable status and credibility. Otherwise, there will be many corrupt practices.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the national goods factories themselves: The national goods factories themselves should prevent and control the troublemakers. First, they should explain the characteristics of their products so that customers will not be confused. This method requires the power of publicity. Second, unscrupulous merchants should be given serious warnings. Those unscrupulous merchants who fear the law may do less of the dreamy dream of making money!</p>
<p>(3) Regarding customers: I think that the first contributor to the development of national goods should be the customers. No matter how cheap and good foreign goods are, wise customers will not buy them; no matter how unscrupulous merchants try to pass off fish eyes as pearls, ambitious customers will not be deceived by them, and will instead give them serious sanctions. The words that Mr. Ying told me have already enlightened me to how much progress customers' psychology has made in recent years. To clean up the scoundrels in national goods, customers can be said to be the most powerful army. If a customer discovers counterfeit national goods, first, expose the dark secrets of this store to the public; second, report directly to the national goods factory and give them a punishment. Some people think that Chinese people are most afraid of trouble. I hope that everyone will embrace a patriotic enthusiasm and get rid of the inferior nature of "each person sweeping the snow in front of their own door." I think this is what ambitious customers are happy to do!</p>
<p>In short, at a time when finance is declining and foreign goods are dominating our country's market, the national goods industry has already suffered great oppression. If unscrupulous merchants disregard morality for the sake of profit and pass off foreign goods as national goods, the reputation of national goods will be destroyed as a result. If we want to make the dying national goods embark on a path of health, only the national goods organizations, national goods factories, and customers can join hands to implement hard work. Then, there will be a bright future ahead. Several Key Points for Promoting Native Cloth by Lu Shu'ang</p>
<p>Promoting the use of native cloth can revive rural areas and relieve people's livelihood. This is something everyone knows. However, the promotion through word of mouth or writing cannot be said to be insufficient, but the comrades who can truly use native cloth are still rare. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The general gentlemen, ladies, and young ladies in the cities think that the cloth woven with cotton yarn is native cloth. If this interpretation is considered correct, then the enthusiasm of the intellectuals to use native cloth can be said to have reached its peak. Just look at the men, women, old, and young walking on the road. Are they not all wearing a blue cloth long gown, or cheongsam, or shirt and pants? In fact, this is a big mistake. The native cloth that we are promoting is to sell the cloth woven by rural women on wooden looms to the market and wear it on the bodies of our compatriots. This is the right way to do it. If the blue cloth that everyone is wearing now is made by machine, it must not be recognized as native cloth. Moreover, there are even some shameless unscrupulous merchants who buy cheap foreign white cotton cloth, dye it blue themselves, add a national goods brand, deceive our compatriots, only care about making money for themselves, and disregard their conscience being lost. Promoting native cloth in this way, the more people who use it, the thicker the profits of the unscrupulous merchants, and the more difficult the livelihood of the farmers. This truly betrays the enthusiasm of the promoters and the good intentions of the users. This point must be paid serious attention to. Therefore, when we promote native cloth, we must first determine the principles of native cloth. In my personal opinion, only cloth made with domestic yarn and woven by rural women on wooden looms can be called native cloth. Perhaps there are other opinions. Please, enthusiastic promoters, publish more opinions, compile reports, so that compatriots who sympathize with and use native cloth have a basis to rely on, and avoid being fooled by a good-sounding term for a "native cloth movement" that has a name but no substance.</p>
<p>Why do wealthy people and more knowledgeable people not like to use native cloth? This psychology is easy to guess. The material of native cloth is rough and the style is not beautiful. Wearing it on the body, they themselves think it is not decent, they are looked down upon by others, and their own value is reduced. Therefore, although there are now several gentlemen who are extremely enthusiastic in promoting it, and they themselves are covered in native cloth and practice it personally, it can be said that they have done their best. However, few of the disciples taught by them can follow the teachings of the old master and use native cloth. This shows that psychological construction is the fundamental condition for reforming everything. I hope that the comrades who bear the responsibility of leadership will recognize that wearing foreign cloth is a great shame and humiliation, and wearing native cloth is supreme honor. Subtly influence and change the minds of the society, so that everyone recognizes native cloth as a good treasure, and completely change the psychology of despising native cloth in the past. Then it will be easier to promote native cloth.</p>
<p>Recently, blue cloth long gowns have become popular in various places – unfortunately, they are not native cloth. At first, only a small number of students in schools wore them. Now, people from all levels of society are wearing blue cloth. This shows that the actions of students are enough to change the habits of society. In the future, as long as students in various places recognize the principles of native cloth, on the one hand, promote it to the society, and on the other hand, use it themselves first, I think that in the near future, native cloth will be able to sell well in the market. As for how to change the students' views? We hope that the teachers who serve as role models will first lead by example, set an example, use their personality to influence, and use morality to persuade. There is no way that youths who are full of sympathy will not be moved? We especially hope that the college students who are the student leaders will take the lead in promoting it and set an example for the primary and secondary school students. At the same time, they will personally go to the primary and secondary schools to promote the use of native cloth extensively. The spread of the news will be as easy as turning one's hand.</p>
<p>I also have an idea about the style of clothing, which is also extremely important. If the style is too unrefined, it will also easily make people suspicious. At the Shanghai Native Cloth Movement Conference last year, the display of many clothing styles for children, women, adults, and students was very popular. This shows that native cloth can also be made into fashionable clothing. I sincerely hope that the gentlemen who are enthusiastic about the native cloth movement will think of a way to make people in society recognize the loveliness of native cloth clothing and arouse their sympathy for using native cloth.</p>
<p>The native cloth movement and native cloth entering the city. It can be said that the throat has been shouted a lot, but the effect is still not seen. The reason is that there are still few good ways. That is why I do not hesitate to be verbose and write out these small opinions for the reference of the comrades who are enthusiastic about the native cloth movement. Future Hope of the Huasheng Electric Factory by Bei Qiu</p>
<p>Speaking of the Huasheng Electric Factory, to this day, as long as people pay a little attention to national goods industry, most people know about it. This is not only because the Huasheng Electric Factory itself has a long and arduous history, which evokes people's memories, but also because the progress of Huasheng's products can win the permanent trust and welcome of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>I recall that Mr. Zhu Qiqing, a pioneer in industry, said in an article on the 15th anniversary of the factory: "I still remember in the twelfth or thirteenth year of the Republic of China, when I had just returned to China from Europe and the United States, I realized that radio communications should be promoted as soon as possible in order to resist foreign goods. Before promoting it, I should try to manufacture it myself. I discussed with Mr. Wang Xiaoxu at the Daxiao Electric Factory (at that time, I did not know that there was a Huasheng Electric Factory, so I did not go to contact them) to create a 1,500-watt high-frequency AC generator. After the machine was completed, I requested the former Ministry of Communications to assist it. At that time, the authorities did not believe that the Chinese could manufacture electrical machinery themselves, and did not invite permission. If the highest transportation authority in a country is like this, let alone the general Chinese people. However, the most difficult thing is that the latest modern industry run by the Chinese themselves—the electrical industry—can struggle to survive under the pressure of strong economic power of foreign merchants and without the actual encouragement and maintenance of the government today. I have to express my deep admiration for the Huasheng Electric Manufacturing Office at the time of the 15th anniversary..."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qiqing's feelings are not only felt by me, but also by all ambitious Chinese people.</p>
<p>The current situation is certainly different again. After a difficult and arduous entrepreneurial start, the Huasheng Electric Factory's nearly 20-year history of struggle has jumped to become the "leader" in the national goods electrical industry. Moreover, with the products becoming more and more refined and sales increasing day by day, it has faintly shown the heroic posture of driving out foreign goods and replacing them. The stubborn foreign merchants have to pay attention to it. Therefore, the future of Huasheng Electric Factory has become an unlimited force. In China, which is under construction, this has undoubtedly become a huge new force in the national industry.</p>
<p>So, how will the Huasheng Electric Factory make redoubled efforts in the future to revive China's national industry?</p>
<p>We cherish the Huasheng Electric Factory, and we certainly hope that the Chinese people will have more permanent trust and promotion in its development. At the same time, we also hope that it will make more unremitting efforts:</p>
<p>The products are excellent, and we must strive for even more excellence;</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>National Goods Weekly, Shen Bao.</p>
<p>The price is cheap, and we should strive for even cheaper:</p>
<p>Manufacturing must be creative, and production must be universalized.</p>
<p>I hope that in today's cry of "saving the country through science and engineering," we can open up a bright path forward for China's electrical industry! The National Goods Principal by Chun Hua</p>
<p>Our principal's nickname is "National Goods Principal." Why do we call him "National Goods Principal"? The reason for this is a long story, so listen to me slowly explain:</p>
<p>Our principal graduated from Shanghai ×× University. Most ordinary university graduates wear suits and leather shoes, completely like foreigners. But our principal has never worn a suit, nor has he ever worn leather shoes. He wears a set of free-style student attire made of wool, and he always wears a pair of cloth shoes, cloth soles and cloth uppers, and this cloth is also native cloth produced locally. Not only are his outer garments made of national goods cloth, but also his inner shirts are all made of national goods cloth.</p>
<p>When he goes to the cloth store to buy clothing material, he must first ask if this is a national product? Which cloth factory's product is this? If asking is not enough, he will carefully check the trademark before he is willing to buy it. Sometimes the shopkeeper is cunning and deceives him. After he discovers it, he must return it and denounce the shopkeeper's dishonesty.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Wu Zhihui and others advocated the native cloth movement, he also responded to the call. He once swore that from then on, he would do his best to promote the native cloth movement. He immediately made a set of student attire made of native cloth. Strangely enough, the student attire made of native cloth is neither soft nor hard, and it fits him very well. In this way, his clothing is made of native cloth, and his shoes are also made of native cloth. From top to bottom, everything is native cloth. Therefore, some people call him "Native Cloth Principal."</p>
<p>Whenever he has the opportunity, he makes propaganda to promote national goods. He encourages people to wear national goods, use national goods, and eat national goods. Every time he sees a student wearing foreign wool, cloth, or silk clothing, he must sincerely say to that student: "This is a foreign product, and it is very expensive. You wear so much clothing, and foreigners have earned a few more yuan from you. China has a few fewer yuan. Do you know that? It is probably not your idea to buy this clothing material, but your family's idea. I hope you will tell your family in the future not to buy these foreign clothing materials anymore..." At that time, the student can only blush and dare not lift his head. After a while, our students all wear national goods clothing, and no one can be found wearing foreign clothing. So the students under the leadership of the "National Goods Principal" have also become "National Goods Students"! A Story Worth Noting</p>
<p>I have a story</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there was an old man named Wang who exclusively ran two silk and satin stores, specializing in selling domestically produced Hangzhou silk and Huzhou crepe. He would always lean back in his chair day and night, thinking hard about how to make his business prosper? How to earn a few more old coins? Indeed, he did not use his efforts wrongly. He was indeed able to make his business prosper and earn gold every day. His life can be said to be extremely rich. Unfortunately, later he suddenly fell ill and died. Of course, he passed on all his good wealth to his two sons, but these two unfilial children only spent their days eating, whoring, and gambling. Therefore, in less than a year, they completely used up all their existing family property. Later, they simply closed the store. With no income, only expenses, of course, in less than two years, they were completely ruined and became completely destitute... "</p>
<p>In this story, we can clearly see that the reason why old man Wang was able to be prosperous was that he was able to make the money he received exceed the money he spent. At the same time, the reason why his sons went bankrupt was that they made the money they spent exceed the money they received. Therefore, if our compatriots always buy foreign goods, they are just sending money to foreign countries, and they have no way to earn a penny from foreigners. Then, no matter how large or rich the national wealth is, wouldn't it also come to the same end after a few years, just like the blood in the body that is only flowing outwards, wouldn't it be fatal?</p>
<p>Compatriots, please pay attention and don't cry until you see the coffin! The Issuance of Translated Western Books by Li Jialu</p>
<p>This year, the government has stipulated that it is the Student National Goods Year, which makes one of the most difficult and unsolvable problems for us is buying Western books.</p>
<p>There are about 3,000 public and private universities and secondary schools in the country, with an average of 200 students per school, and about 600,000 university and secondary school students in the country. If each person buys Western books for 5 yuan in national currency each year, the total leak in Western books alone is more than 3 million yuan annually. This is so alarming! But in order to explore new knowledge and strive for progress, we cannot reject foreign books because of one meal. However, for the sake of the country's future, we must never let it take its natural course without seeking a remedy!</p>
<p>According to my recent investigation, there are Longmen, Zhongshan, Guanghua, Dacheng, Lushan, Qingmei and other bookstores in Shanghai that print many translated Western books. At the same time, there is a Beijing Bookstore in Peiping that specializes in translating and printing Western books.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Western books printed, the printing is exceptionally exquisite and the prices are extremely low, only a quarter of the price of the original Western books. So it is said: "In terms of academics, there is no loss, and in terms of economy, there is a great saving. It can both reduce the burden and resist the economic aggression of imperialism."</p>
<p>I think this is what all of you who care about national goods are happy to hear! One Week of National Goods News</p>

<p>After returning from the national goods market, I received an introduction to visit the Jiande Soap Factory. Since it was nearby, I wanted to visit. I took the No. 18 tram and got off at Nanyang Bridge. After turning a corner, I stepped onto Pingjili Road. Not many steps later, the Jiande Soap Factory appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the owner, after 20 minutes, I finished walking through the so-called small family-style factory. The factory site cannot be considered large, only possessing four rooms, but the prototype of a small scale is complete enough; in terms of organization, it is also possible to see some facts of "order."</p>
<p>Jiande Soap Company specializes in manufacturing Blue Flower Soap; it is divided into six categories: "Square, Round, Extra Large," etc.; it is packaged in boxes for wholesale. The sales in the market are also very good; according to the factory owner's report: the total turnover last year reached more than 41,570 yuan. This number is naturally not impressive. But it is enough for their year-round efforts.</p>
<p>The performance of "Blue Powder" has special chemical effects; (bleaching) Therefore, soap mixed with blue powder can "remove dirt quickly and whiten doubly"; especially, it can avoid yellowing. It is a good washing product. The wide sales are not entirely accidental.</p>
<p>In the current society where the social economy is so declining, the implementation of imperialist dumping policies and the low purchasing power of the general public, many national goods factories no longer sound the whistle and emit black smoke every day. However, small family-style factories hiding in a corner have maintained their lives through hard work and careful operation.</p>
<p>The whole society is experiencing a storm of "closures and shutdowns." The Jiande Soap Factory can stand firm on the national goods front and resist foreign goods, and calmly support itself. I think: the high quality of the products and the attentive service are not unrelated. Overview of Toothbrush Production and Sales in the National Goods Trend by Ye</p>
<p>Toothbrushes are a type of industry and a daily necessity for us. China has always manufactured them by hand. With machine manufacturing, and the latest ones sold in our country's market, are the Swallow Brand and Hygiene Brand of imported goods. At that time, the competition between hand-made toothbrushes in our country and the exquisite imported goods was inevitably overturned. After the "May Fourth" Movement in the eighth year of the Republic of China, people with insight successively established factories for self-manufacturing. Soon, the Hygiene Brand and Swallow Brand gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>At present, there are about ten large-scale domestic machine-made toothbrush factories in the country. To the best of my knowledge, the Shanghai First Brand Toothbrush Factory is the most detailed in its manufacturing situation and production and sales status. Now, I will describe the development process, manufacturing situation, and recent sales situation of the factory as follows to inform the readers.</p>
<p>The First Brand Toothbrush Factory was founded in 1925. The factory is located on Quzhenren Road in Nanshi, Shanghai, and the general distribution office is located at 204 Hubei Road. At that time, it was a small-scale operation. After five or six years of struggle, the business became increasingly developed. By 1931, the capital was increased. Engaged in expansion, adding machinery, and large-scale manufacturing. It is estimated that there are more than 20 machines now, and more than 5,000 toothbrushes can be produced every day.</p>
<p>The process of manufacturing toothbrushes is very complicated, and it is divided into cutting bones, splitting bones, setting length, planing bones, grinding boards, leveling holes, grinding heads, grinding necks, erecting holes, cutting backs, tail holes, extracting bone oil, bleaching, polishing, polishing, planting hair, filling heads, cutting hair, repairing threads, rinsing, clamping boards, plating boards, printing, cutting horizontal hair, cutting phoenix heads, sorting, disinfecting, and boxing. More than 28 procedures. If you even make bristle work, such as loosening hair, combing hair, bleaching, ironing hair, making colors, tying hair, dividing lengths, matching hair, etc., there are more than 30 procedures in total.</p>
<p>In terms of raw materials, nothing is more important than cattle bones and pig bristles. Cattle bones are taken from Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao and other places, and pig bristles are taken from Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi provinces; they are all domestic products, and there is no need to use foreign raw materials, so "completely national goods" is a well-deserved name.</p>
<p>As for the sales of the First Brand toothbrush, Shanghai is the most, followed by the Yangtze River area and the provinces of North China. Recently, due to the fact that people use national goods more often, the sales market in Nanjing has expanded suddenly. In order to facilitate customers, a branch office has been specially set up at No. 388 Taiping Road, Nanjing; and since the post office revised the method of collecting payment for goods, the procedures are simple; therefore, Gansu, Shaanxi, Yunnan and other provinces in remote and bad places often have correspondence purchases. On the one hand, it is also because the factory manufactures properly and the styles are novel. For example, the style of toothbrush No. 22 is beautiful, exquisite and cute, suitable for the physiology of teeth; and there are electrical therapy experts, Dr. Jiang Shicun, who preside over the disinfection with ultraviolet rays. Consumers should be happy to use it.</p>
<p>To sum up, the production and sales situation of national goods daily necessities. Toothbrushes are originally a small part of the industry, and they are still able to push down imported goods; but it also depends on the patriotic people's efforts in the national salvation movement and continuous propaganda; I hope that the spirit of patriotism will always exist, and I believe that the day of our country's revival is not far away. Glorious National Goods Company by Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>From a personal perspective: "Only by enduring the greatest hardships can one become a person above others." From a business perspective: "After suffering comes sweetness." The result of arduous operation is glory!</p>
<p>The greater the oppression, the greater the resistance! The aggression of imported goods against national goods is becoming increasingly acute! Anesthetizing! Everyone knows it, but the achievements of the national goods industry in struggling for several years, although the environment has deteriorated! Still barely satisfactory, from the city to the inland to the border areas, there are national goods companies established, and the article "National Goods Network" written by the reporter in this publication last year is gradually being realized. This is such a gratifying thing!</p>
<p>There is also one thing worth reporting. That day, the reporter went to the China National Goods Company to shop and witnessed many foreigners also going there to be our customers! I can't help but feel something! If foreigners can welcome our national goods, then the relationship is truly turning for the better.</p>

<p>Bidding War Rises Again</p>
<p>Passing 840 Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong Market Tightens, Rumors of Profiteering Buys</p>
<p>Half-Day Increase of 9 Yuan 7 Jiao</p>
<p>Shortened Business Hours in the Aftermarket</p>
<p>The gold market, which was closed for two days due to bank clearing and closures, reopened yesterday. People's minds continued to prosper due to the rise and fall of the overseas silver market. Although it was once weak due to the pressure of the foreign exchange market, the buying interest of large households was still strong. The Hong Kong market tightened, rumors of profiteering spread, and it actually passed the 840 yuan mark. In the early morning, overseas calls were made during the closing period, and the prices of British and American silver were flat. The Montevideo forward silver market narrowed by 3.5% and rose by 1% unevenly. The exchange rate narrowed, and the price of raw gold in London rose by 3.5 pence. People's minds stabilized, and pre-market trading opened at around 30 yuan, which was reduced to 28.9 yuan. The Central Bank's listed price was known, and the British and American were flat, and the customs gold unit rose by 4%. The standard price of gold bidding rose to 867 yuan and 2 jiao, and soon rose to over 30 yuan, and the buying interest was stimulated to become enthusiastic. Those with advantages such as the Central Bank and the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu sold out one after another. The foreign exchange market tended to gradually downstream. The HSBC listed price, British flat and American shrink zero six two five, had little impact, and the domestic market hardened. The sellers took advantage of the trend and once weakened, approaching the 30 yuan mark, but the large households continued to maintain and tend to flatten. Reuters reported that the Hong Kong market was softer, and the buying interest recovered, but although it rose, it was still low. Later, under the strong progress of large households, the Hong Kong market remained soft, so the buying interest was frequent, and rumors rose again, and it passed the 40 yuan mark, and the trend turned pretty. However, because the Central Bank and banks took advantage of the high price to sell out, it repeatedly fell back into the 40 yuan mark. However, people's minds were already pretty, and it was soon pulled up again. At noon, it was still above the 40 yuan mark. The market situation was uncertain for half a day, but the trend was still pretty. The swap was already advanced by the short sellers yesterday. Recently, due to the hot weather, the afternoon business hours will be changed from 2:30 to 4:00 from today. Now, the market situation for half a day will be recorded later.</p>

<p>"Modern Youth" A burst of car horns passed by. Shiliang saw a man and a woman sitting inside, embracing tightly, with a smile on their faces. Ah! The man was his own son, whom he had searched for so painstakingly across mountains and rivers. A hateful northwesterly wind followed the car, blowing so hard that the old man could hardly open his eyes. Chase after it, chase, chase, his legs racing against the car! What a foolish move, in an instant, even the shadow of the car was gone. Broadcasting News The China Harmonica Association is the pioneer in promoting harmonica music in our country. The harmonica has become universally loved among the people of all walks of life, which is attributable to the efforts of the association. As for the selection of harmonica team members of the association, they are appointed only after long-term training and assessment by the association. The proficiency and excellence of their skills are self-evident. In response to the request of people from all walks of life, the association will broadcast the latest newly compiled programs at the Xinxin Company Broadcasting Station. There will be ensembles, solos, duets, trios, and quartets. Mr. Wang Qinglong will also broadcast a special short-scale harmonica solo program, which is particularly unique. The broadcast time is from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM every Sunday afternoon. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to it when the time comes. Movie News Premiere of Heroes and Beauties The Drama Research Association of National Jinan University is also a drama troupe that is a collection of talent on the sea. "Heroes and Beauties" will be premiered at the Carlton Grand Theater from the 4th of this month. This play is one of the famous works of the world's great dramatist Shaw. The association held an informal performance in the auditorium of Jinan University in early March this year, which won unanimous praise from all walks of life, and was especially praised by the press. In order to promote the drama movement and promote the art of drama, the association will hold another three-day public performance at the Carlton Theater from the 4th. For this public performance, all costumes and props have been newly arranged. The stage setting, such as the scenery, etc., is particularly magnificent, costing more than a thousand yuan, and is designed by the famous dramatist Gu Zhongyi and drawn by the famous artist Shen Qifeng. Everything is perfect. The director is Mr. Zhou Yao, and the consultant is Mr. Hong Shen, both of whom have high positions in the drama world. Therefore, the excellence of this performance can be predicted. Autumn Fan and Bright Lamp, Li Lili and Diao Banhua's cooperation, the latest famous product of Lianhua. The title "Autumn Fan and Bright Lamp" speaks for itself. The sadness of the plot and the twists and turns of the story can be understood without saying anything. The whole film is structured with twists and turns, and the story develops over a long period of fifteen years, writing about the various experiences of a weak woman after being abandoned, her husband leaving and her children scattered. However, more than ten years later, they meet in court. Fortunately, the family is reunited, but they become flying swallows again. The plot is unpredictable and unexpected everywhere. The screenwriter and director Tan Youliu can be said to have put a lot of effort into the handling of the plot, and in terms of directing, he also pays close attention to the skills of depiction, and there are many novel creations in the expression techniques. Li Lili has always been known for her lively roles, but in this film, she transforms into a gentle and quiet woman. Diao Banhua, a new star of Lianhua, makes her debut on the screen in this film, playing an important role. With a small test of her skills, she is already quite outstanding. Her future development is unlimited. Shang Guanwu played the local tyrant in "The Highway", which was already praised by the society. Now, in this film, he plays an old man, with wonderful makeup and a performance that is able to portray everything vividly. Such acting skills are rare. In addition, Gu Menghu, Jiang, and Junchao are also successful. In short, this film is flawless in all aspects and is a rare masterpiece. Random Notes from Yi Hua Yue Feng's new work "The Doctor's Wife" has been sent to Beijing for review of the script. Hu Ping has been writing diligently recently. It is said that his works are published in the "Shadow Dance News" and "Silver Car" (formerly known as Silver Kingdom), which will be published on July 6. The interior work of the sound film "Triumph Song" directed by Bu Wancang is coming to an end, with only the "Spring Student's Doorway" scene currently being filmed. The new child star Liu Li plays Yuan Meiyun's friend in "The Tempest" and Yuan Meiyun's brother in "Triumph Song", and his performance is very good. The sound film "Hero of the Times" directed by Ying Yunwei has been completed 40%. Guan Hongda, the fat man, is getting fatter and fatter. His foolish expression in "Triumph Song" is quite amusing. Wang Guilin, who played Jin Yan's father in "Humanity", plays the same role in "Triumph Song" as in "Humanity". Judging from Wang's performance in "Humanity", "Triumph Song" will naturally make us even more satisfied. Ouyang Yuqian is in charge of directing "The Peach Blossom Fan" Ouyang Yuqian is a famous figure in the drama world, but he has never directed any film. The New China Film Company's "The Peach Blossom Fan" is Yuqian's directorial debut. However, Yuqian usually has considerable experience in film directing and has published the following statement: "When it comes to the creators of film and drama, it is naturally said that they are directors, but it is by no means a personal matter of the director. From the point of view of writing the script, the original author is the one who creates, but movies are not read, and movie scripts cannot be published as literature. If they are not translated by the director and photographer, they cannot become works of art. In this way, the director is only in the ranks of re-creators, in the same position as the screenwriter and photographer. Otherwise, the director holds the central power in the creation of a movie. Although he is not a creator, the creative power of all aspects is completely concentrated in him. On the one hand, he respects the opinions of the original author, and on the other hand, he has to consider how to make it effective on the screen. For the convenience of use, there must be a means of cutting and organizing. As for the scenery, photography, etc., he can directly control the actors, not to mention. Therefore, the director bears a great responsibility for the quality of a film, and there is no room for any excuse." From this, it can be predicted that the future performance of "The Peach Blossom Fan" will be excellent.</p>

<h3>Anglo-French Naval Relations: Mutual Notification of Shipbuilding Situations</h3>
<p>(London) Due to the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British government is now in diplomatic contact with the German and French governments to discuss the procedures for exchanging naval programs between the three governments. All technical issues will be involved, such as the exact types of ships Germany intends to build next year and which types of warships will be built to the maximum limits specified. The British intend to gather information on the programs of Germany, France, and Britain once they have obtained the desired information from Germany. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) With cheers, Monsell announced today that Lloyd George's statement yesterday that Germany had recently suggested abolishing submarines but was rejected by the British government was completely unfounded and contrary to clear facts. The German representative reiterated the views expressed by Hitler on May 21 that Germany would also be willing to abolish submarines if other countries wished to do so. Britain has long advocated for the abolition of submarines and has repeatedly promoted this action since the Washington Conference. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Summons Naval Commanders to Study Important Issues</h3>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini convened a temporary meeting today with admirals and the highest advisory committee on naval issues to study various important issues concerning the Italian Navy. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that the special meeting of the Naval Committee convened by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini convened this morning to discuss important naval matters concerning the dispatch of troops to the colonies. This committee is the highest authority of the Ministry of the Navy. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Naval Powers Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude, None Willing to Take Responsibility for Convening a Conference</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to speculation by government leaders here, the current rush of naval powers to engage in naval competition on paper has two purposes: one is to urge other countries to convene a naval conference, and the other is to be able to negotiate more favorably. The reason why countries are unwilling to disclose their shipbuilding plans lies in this. The difficulty is that although all countries hope for an early convening of a naval conference, in fact, no country wants to avoid the responsibility of convening it. For example, after Britain learned of Germany's shipbuilding plan, it sought to make its shipbuilding plan public, intending to promote a European naval conference to clarify the atmosphere so that a world naval conference could be observed and completed soon. Recently, Britain also asked the United States what its views were on naval issues, and the United States replied that it would depend on the attitudes of other countries. However, the United States' desire to maintain its existing ratio is very clear. Furthermore, the United States has decided to bring its navy to the treaty limits by 1942, which is also a fact, but there is still room for flexibility. For example, the current plan is to build seven new battleships, which will begin in 1937 and are expected to be completed in seven years. Therefore, the US shipbuilding plan is also on paper, intended to be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations, which is no different from other countries. Only in this way, there is a question of whether countries will truly greatly expand their navies in the next few years. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Question: Italy Rejects British Proposal, Roman Journalist Explains Reasons</h3>
<p>(Rome) Today's Italian Daily published an article by the famous Italian journalist Gaeta, stating that the British proposal to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian issue, namely, ceding a corner of British Somaliland to Abyssinia to give it access to the sea, cannot resolve the two key points Italy considers important: one is the guarantee of resisting Abyssinian aggression, and the other is the addition of the Ogaden region to Italian colonies. If the British proposal is implemented, the Italo-Abyssinian conflict will be inevitable and only delayed. Delay will completely benefit Abyssinia. Once Abyssinia obtains the port of Zeila, it will be able to import military supplies without restriction and have the opportunity to become a maritime power and plot against Italy. The port of Zeila will thus bring economic benefits to Britain and economic losses to Italy. Italy is currently seeking resource-rich land and cannot be satisfied with obtaining several square miles of useless land. Eden expressed regret to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for not accepting the British proposal, not knowing that the Italian side was even more regretful that the British could not understand the reasons for Italy. Italy has sought a peaceful solution, but Abyssinia has rejected every Italian proposal and is assembling troops to threaten Italian territories in East Africa. Therefore, Italy has no choice but to engage in self-defense to prevent Abyssinian aggression from continuing. In fact, the British proposal does not conform to the purpose that people generally believe Britain holds and cannot meet Italy's needs, making no effective contribution to the maintenance of peace, as it does not guarantee Italy's immunity from Abyssinian aggression. At the same time, various newspapers in Cairo, Egypt, opposed the British suggestion that Britain should not allow ships transporting war materials and troops to pass through the Suez Canal, saying that ships of both belligerent and non-belligerent countries should have the right to pass freely through the canal. If Britain blockades the canal, it will be seen as a serious violation of Egyptian independence. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, British Minister Without Portfolio Eden reported to the House of Commons on his visits to France and Italy, explaining the proposals made by Britain to Italy to resolve the Abyssinian issue. The most important of these was the construction of a railway between Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, passing through Abyssinia, and the demarcation of a piece of territory in British Somaliland to be incorporated into Abyssinia as the country's outlet to the sea. This British proposal has caused repercussions in France. Today, Le Temps published a commentary, saying, "The 1906 treaty signed by Britain, France, and Italy regarding Abyssinia stipulates that Britain and Italy shall not engage in activities that compete with the French-owned Djibouti railway. Now, the British government has actually allowed Eden to propose the construction of a railway, which is a clear violation of the 1906 treaty. Moreover, Britain is granting Abyssinia benefits that Britain and Italy themselves have never obtained, which greatly damages French interests, but it has not consulted with the French government in advance, which is indeed strange." Diplomatic figures also expressed surprise that Eden did not seek the opinion of Laval, saying that Britain intends to give the port of Zeila to Abyssinia. This port is very close to the port of Djibouti in Somaliland. Abyssinia's transportation now has an outlet to the sea through the port of Djibouti. This British proposal is a direct threat to the port of Djibouti. In addition, Article 9 of the 1906 Anglo-French-Italian treaty stipulates, "Any railway line that passes through the territory of a signatory state, passes through Abyssinian territory, and connects with the Abyssinian railway, and is sufficient to directly compete with a railway built by one of the contracting states, the three governments mutually promise not to allow its construction until a solution has been reached." The so-called "railway built by one of the contracting states" in this article refers to the railway built by France from the port of Djibouti to the Abyssinian capital. The British government should have sought the opinion of the French government before making this suggestion. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news released here, Italy's military preparations in Abyssinia have reached a deep level. Italy currently has 60 airfields and 5,000 radio stations in its East African colonies, as well as 10,000 kilometers of roads. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The cabinet held a regular meeting this morning to continue discussing solutions to the Abyssinian problem. However, the nature of the discussion is unknown. Some newspapers reported that the government is considering economic sanctions in the event of an Italo-Abyssinian war. This statement has been denied by officials. Officials said that regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Britain has proposed exchanging views with the French government through diplomatic channels in the near future. Before consulting with the French government, the British government cannot determine a plan of action on the issue. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Meets British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Issues a Statement on the Situation</h3>
<p>(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu had lunch with Foreign Secretary Hoare. In the afternoon, he will be received by Minister Without Portfolio Eden in the Cabinet Office of the House of Commons. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

In the afternoon, he visited Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare and Lord President of the Council MacDonald. Titulescu issued a statement stating that various issues of peace are inseparable and that all countries should take effective measures to work together to achieve the proposals in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia Proposes Neutralizing Austria, London's Diplomatic Circles Are Discussing</h3>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that Czechoslovakia has proposed that various countries recognize Austria as a permanently neutral country based on the Swiss model. According to reports, diplomatic circles in London are discussing this matter, saying that although the British government is willing to support any efforts to stabilize the political situation in Central Europe, it is unwilling to bear the responsibility of military intervention.

<h3>This Year's Budget: France's Fiscal Deficit Reaches 7-8 Billion Francs, Government Decides to Implement Austerity</h3>

At the same time, Prime Minister Laval also declared in the committee, "The government will implement all necessary measures to stop the attacks of speculators." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet will issue the first decree-law on the implementation of austerity measures tomorrow, in accordance with the Enabling Act. The content is roughly as follows: (1) Officials who hold multiple positions shall not receive multiple salaries. (2) Save the expenses of the national defense agencies and set up a special committee to suggest possible austerity measures. In addition, there are various important austerity measures that will be announced after the National Day on July 14. In order to avoid disagreements with the government, the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has decided to suspend meetings during the parliamentary recess. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Wealth Distribution Plan Faces Strong Opposition in Congress</h3>
<p>(Washington) The phenomenon of Congress resisting the government is becoming increasingly apparent today.

Because all tax bills must be submitted by this committee, congressional leaders privately stated today that if Congress does not adjourn early, this kind of action to resist the government may become uncontrollable and will not lead to the introduction of various bills opposed by the government. Therefore, President's Roosevelt's wealth distribution plan may prompt Congress to adjourn early. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
