<p>— 恒</p>
<p>我國自國民革命以還。政府歷年所舉之債。以內債爲多。外債方面。除一九二八年之中比美六釐公債。一九三三年之棉麥借欵。一九三四年之六釐美金庚欵等公債外。尚無巨額外債可言。此其原因。半由於政府之不願多舉外債。半亦在於外人之不願貸欵與我耳。唯最近以來。風氣頓轉。自日本高唱中日經濟提携之後。接着有英國發動之國際貸欵中國運動。二者雖皆尚在醖釀之中。成功與否。今猶難言。然此種現象。要爲國民革命以來所僅見。雖反對外債者。或視爲帝國主義加緊對我侵略之徵象。但就贊成利用外資者之觀點言之。亦可視爲此由我國政治較前安定。列强樂於投資之表示。究其實。外債之爲利爲弊。其關鍵要在對於外資之能否善爲運用。此於昨日評論。業已言及。今請再就事實申論之。</p>
<p>就事實言。我國爲一入超國。資金無法積聚。欲謀生産建設之開展。舍輸入外資之一途外。别無他法。我國向日國際收支逆差。每賴外人對華投資爲之挹注。其故即在於是。故外資之流入。實爲我國在此入超貿易狀態中必然之趨勢。蓋非此即無法調整我國對外之收支關係。明乎此。即知欲使我國去年流出之白銀。重復儘數流入。依治標之方法言。恐非舉辦外債不可。而物質建設之開展。需欵尤大。其勢亦非利用外資莫辦。是以我國今日之問題。不在反對外資之流入。而在研究外資之如何運用。質言之。苟能用之於生産方面。則雖受一時之束縛。終有翻身之一日。否則。舉辦外債。流弊甚多。其爲危險。自不待言。</p>
<p>夷考我國外資流入之歷史已有四十餘年。大抵自庚子以迄辛亥。以鐵路電政借欵爲多。故外人雖因投資而取得優厚之利息。特殊之權益。然事業長存我國。故尚不失爲生産的。唯自辛亥而後。外資雖有大量之輸入。然其性質。則多屬於政治借欵。且用於內戰者多。不獨既不生産。抑且從而愈益喪失其在關鹽諸税之税收權。我國今日國際收支上之懸殊。財政上之困難。此其一大原因。有害無利。莫此爲甚。懲前毖後。今後若欲利用外資。對於生産不生産之一點。必須嚴加區别。苟其爲生産的。應加歡迎。設其爲不生産的。則埃及亡國之前車可鑒。應忍痛自律。勿輕於嘗試。唯以我國今日白銀存額之短少。爲救濟敝疲之市面計。貨幣借欵。似亦需要。然我人以爲此僅爲一時治標之辦法。根本要圖。仍在我國生産事業之開發與保育。唯其如此。故不舉外債則已。若舉外債。必須用之於生産之途也。</p>
<p>近時消息傳來。日人所唱之中日經濟提携。旨在使我安於農業國之地位。故其期望。欲我更行降低其對日之關税税率。我爲農業國家。復興農業。自屬必要之圖。然謀工業之發展。亦爲現代國家所不可或缺者。否則即無以自存。故於此一點。國人實有充分注意與研究之必要。至於英國發動之貸欵運動。是否亦有類似之條件。現尚不得而知。且是否能成爲事實。亦尚屬問題。惟苟其不附政治上之條件。而其欵又可以任我用之於生産者。則就事論事。無反對之必要也。</p>

<h3 id="c99">市社會局吳局長報告市面恐慌之前因後果 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>昨晨在市府擴大紀念週</p>
<p>中央社云、本市市政府昨農舉行擴大紀念週、由吳市長領導行禮、并由社會局局長吳醒亞演說、兹誌原詞如下、</p>
<p>從申新七廠事說起</p>
<p>匠來上海市面蕭條、百業凋敝、至接二連三的銀行錢莊清理商店倒閉之中、雖然把廿三年度的總結賬期勉強安然渡過、但是工商界的困難與危急的情勢、依然十分嚴重、當此之時、工商各界、正在請求中央及地方政府金融界放欵救濟市面、忽然發生申新第七廠因到期押欵不能清償、被其第一債權人匯豐銀行標價拍賣、因為紗廠業是我國新興的民族工業、而申新又是此中巨擘、被拍賣的第七廠、也有五萬六千餘紗椗·七千一百餘線錠·和二千三百餘依此為生的工人、這件事情的發生、實業界印兎死狐悲、一般人士奔走呼號、已經不安的市面、格外加重了不安的程度、現在這件事雖然緩和、而工商界人心依然惶惶、好像大難臨頭、形成「山雨欲來風滿樓」的悲象、</p>
<p>前因後果分析報告</p>
<p>我們把這個工商界不安的現象、從本市全國和世界的觀點去仔細思慮一下、就覺得目前這個局面、的確是已經非常嚴重、目前少數銀行商店的倒閉、和一家紗廠的被拍賣、不過是這個嚴重局面的開始、如果長此下去、不設法消弭、必定全體實業的總崩潰、這不僅是上海市的危機、而是全民族的生死存亡的關頭、我今日趁着這個機會、把這個嚴重情勢的成因、和可能的結果、向諸位作一分析的報告、說到這個嚴重局面的成因、有由來已久的、有最近發生的、有外來的、有內在的、而這些遠因近因外因內因、都是互相牽連·錯綜複雜·不容易各個獨立的分别説明、</p>
<p>外因世界經濟恐慌</p>
<p>先説外來的原因、如果説得遠一點、可以把鴉片戰爭以後·南京條約開始·所訂立的一切不平等條約、影響於工商業的地方、拿來說明、但因話多、這裏且不談、現在單說近的、就要提到一九二九年世界經濟恐慌的暴發、從那年起、恐慌可謂日趨尖鋭、特别提出與我們關系深切的幾件事來説、就有一九三一年的英日相繼放棄金本位、一九三三年的美國放棄金本位、一九三四年的美國厲行白銀政策、同時各國的關稅壁壘步步森嚴、所謂鎖國絰濟、（國家主義的經濟集團經濟·（布洛克經濟）包括統制貿易·管理貨幣·等、無一不是普遍的流行、而且有極具體精細的方法、來實施這些政策的、門户洞開一切落後的中國、既沒有資格加入他們的集團經濟、好像也竟没有方法去和他們講統制貿易限額分配、在這種局面之下、所表現出來的事實、就是我國輸出的貨品、不是因為不勝外國關稅的負担、實際上等於禁止輸入、就是因爲國外市塲購買力低落·或是外國人愛用國貨、或是為他國同樣貨品所替代、而到處碰壁、除去人家必不得已要購用我們的貨品以外、恐怕就不輕易吸取人家的金錢、反過來看一看、洋貨到中國來、是怎樣的情形呢、固然洋貨在中國暢銷、當然有他們優厚的憑藉、比如前面所說、英美日都停止了金本位、他們貨幣的價值减低、同時對我國貨幣的匯價、自然低落、這就是我們有便宜洋貨享用、並且他們政府還用盡種種方法、如豁免出口税·優給獎勵金·來助貨品在中國傾銷、更加中國境內、有的是外國工廠、利用我們的豐富原料和人工、加上他們雄厚資本和精神技術、又何愁出品沒有銷路、所以我們衣食住行的養命之源、已經是仰賴洋貨、其餘不必要的奢侈品·化妝品、甚至有國貨替代的日用品·也都是購用洋貨的、單説自民國十八年以後到現在為止、這六年之中、我們購買洋貨的入超、前年最多、達九萬萬元、去年最少、亦在五萬萬元以上、平均作六萬萬元計算、總共就是三十六萬萬元、六年之間、流出的金錢如許、諸位閉目一思、這是何等危險的影象</p>
<p>龐大入超情勢嚴重</p>
<p>這個龐大的入超、並不是始於最近數年、不過以前還不覺得有這樣嚴重、因為以前貿易儘管入超、並不要拿現錢去抵補、仍然每年有現銀入超、因為有大宗的無形收入、比如華僑的滙欵、外人向我投資等等、近年形勢大變了、華僑的事業、遍處衰落、失業者一批批的返國、增加國內的不安、外人投資、當然銳减、所以現在的貿易入超、必得裝運現銀去償付、加之去年美國實施白銀政策以後、海外銀價飛漲、一般洋商銀行和不肖國人、都把現銀運出海外圖利、總計去年一年生銀出入相抵、流出净數、達二萬四千八百餘萬元、其間財政當局、雖於去年十月十五日、宜布加徵銀出口税與平衡稅、並組設外滙平市委員會、但是十一十二兩月、仍有一千一百餘萬元的銀子輸出、據去年十二月底調查、本市中外銀行的庫存銀、合計不過三萬三千餘萬元、若照那樣的流出不已、要不多時、就可以出空了、</p>
<p>內因農村破產影響</p>
<p>以上都是外來的原因、現在說內在的原因、首先要説到農村破産、關於這件事，近來報章雜誌記載獨多、在座諸君、也有不少來自田間、近來農村破産的真相、大家都已知道、無庸細述、我僅指出農村破產如何影響都市衰落、本來農工商業是互相依賴、不能獨趨繁榮、就是美國那樣大的工業國家、由於農業衰敗、還能引起經濟恐慌、何况我們是以農立國、從前農村的蠶繭·米·麥·棉花·拿來上海換錢、購買工業製造品回去、現在絲業是一敗塗地了、米麥棉花也以購用洋貨為大宗、年在二萬萬元以上、連農民自己也吃起洋米來了、試問都市工業製造品還剩了多少顧客、加上連年不斷的天災人禍、像民國二十年的全國大水災、以及各年各地的蝗風旱匪等災、及九一八·一二八·之空前國難、又不知斵喪了多少元氣、其損失實難以數字計算、這種天災人禍加速度的促進了農村破産、並使以農業為背景的許多內地城市、日見空虚、把所有的財產、逐漸向都市集中、以求安全、乃形成都市充血、內地貧血的現象了、</p>
<p>今後結果不堪推想</p>
<p>上面我已經把上海市面恐慌的成因和現狀、説了許多、現再談談今後的結局、不過未來的事、究竟變化到甚麽形態、這是任何人不可預料的、兹照現狀推演下去、則其結果所至、可得而言者有幾點、一·國外的經濟自衛手段、必定是日益高明、我們的貨品、要想在國外求出路、格外難能、二·洋貨源源而來、價額或將减少、價格更求低廉、以期薄利多賣、因爲國人的購買力、將到油乾燈草盡的地步、這一點去年已經顯然的有此趨勢、三·現銀將繼續流出不止、因爲美國的購銀政策、有其一貫的方針、自金條文案判决後、通貨膨漲、聲勢愈大、以後將按預定步驟、大購白銀、其價必更抬高、四·通貨緊縮·物價低落·農村破產·都市凋敝·洋貨輸入·國産滯銷·也幾件事、都是互爲因果、循環往復地益趨深刻、實業總崩潰、非不可能、五·近調查本市失業人數、較一年以前加增一倍、但今後失業者、必繼續加增無已、殆無疑義、社會不安、問題嚴重、猶記十幾年以前、總理講民族主義時、提到金錢外溢、曾大聲警告我們、「中國人再不覺悟、長此以往、就是外國政治家天天在睡覺、不到十年便要亡國、目前正如總理所昭示的、十年之後、何况今日外國政治經濟侵略、雙管齊下哩、</p>
<p>多難興邦奮鬥勿懈</p>
<p>諸位、我今日所説的話、都是從事實上看出來的、並不是危言聳聽諺云、「多難興邦、」吾人正應趁此危難之時期、遵從蔣委員長苦幹·快幹·實幹·之訓示、奮鬥勿懈、我相信復興民族、正有極大之希望、現在蔣委員長·汪院長·孔部長·宋前部長·陳部長·吳市長·對於挽救目前的民族經濟危機、已有辦法、希望工商界·和金融界·從大局着想、本以往合作精神、來維持現狀、一面恊助政府、共渡難關、須知惟有上下同心協力、乃可共存共榮、至於我們、尤應刻苦耐勞、節衣縮食、一致服用國貨、實行新生活、以個人之聰明才力、盡量爲救國圖存的工作、吾人不要看到目前的情形而灰心餒氣、更不要舍本逐末、舍正路而弗出、我們相信、我國土地若是之大、人民如此之多、只耍一心一德、善於運用、無論外國政治經濟各種建設、如何優美、自然能够迎頭趕上去、</p>

<p>第二債權人贊同政府意旨</p>
<p>中央社云、申新紡織公司所屬第七廠、自被英商匯豐銀行擅自估價拍賣後、引起我國社會之普遍反感、昨晨又有中國工業救濟恊會·上海方民提倡國貨會·中華國貸維持會·上海總工會·中華工業總聯合會·國貨工廠聯合會·機製國貨工廠聯合會·工商管理協會·暨麵粉雜糧等一百六十餘同業公會、聯名函請銀行業·錢業兩同業公會、妥爲集欵維持、中央社記者、昨向有關各方探訪、僉謂、匯豐態度、既已表示有挽回可能、但最後解决、仍需待財政部長孔祥熙氏來滬後、始有辦法、申新紡織公司總經理榮宗敬氏表示、此後不擬多數發言、以免引起枝節問題、第二債權人方面、據中國銀行發言人謂、此後進行、當以政府方面意旨為依歸、如政府能以實力贖回七廠、（取得第一債權人地位、）而又能分担第二債權人之債權者、尤所贊同、又據另一方面傳說、如七廠能由政府力量贖回後、或將交由棉業統制會辦理、蓋該會成立以來、雖已有多種方案提出、迄未見諸實行、今有此機會、當可一展其效能、以為華商各紗廠之楷模、但此說尚待證實云、</p>

<p>國聞社云、立法院長孫科、前日由京來滬、記者以外間傳説、我政府當局、近擬派大員東渡訪問、因於昨晨趨訪孫氏、於哥倫比亞路私寓、當承延見、叩以上說究竟、據孫稱、外間所傳非確、本人並未聞政府將派余赴日、此或由於對方片面之宣傳、本人在滬事畢、明晚即返京云、</p>

<p>史蒂芬氏、為美國運銷合作專家、此次歷金陵大學之聘、主講該校農產品運銷合作、上次應上海銀行農業合作演講會之請、演講各種合作問題多次、史氏對運銷合作、具有豐富經騐、其所主張、確足供我國辦理及研究運銷合作者之重要參考、此文係史氏於二月十二日上午、在該行農業合作演講會所演講、由徐仲廸教授譯述、程泌朱亞强二君紀錄、特將原稿、照錄如下、</p>
<p>關於運銷合作社應注意之事甚多、其中尤以各種運銷合作社之組織方式、最關重要、因各合作社間之關係、及各社本身組織之完密與否、及其方式之是否適宜、實足影響合作社之成敗也、合作社之組織與管理、猶船之於海、既需堅固之船身、更需有經騐之船主管理之、兩者必須兼備、始能安然航行、</p>
<p>A運銷合作社分社組織之先决條件　（一）運銷合作社之分社、應設於農産品集中之自然區域、故運銷合作社與信用合作社、其範圍及地點皆不同、分社所辦理之事項杵以棉花爲例、則爲收籽棉、分等軋花打包堆儲運輸等手續、如以水菓爲例、則爲收菓洗菓檢選水菓、分等包裝裝箱等手續、其他如烟葉茶葉等、合作社亦有相似之手續、故社址必須農産品集中之地點、（二）運銷合作社之區域範圍、不宜過小、因上述種種之手續、必須有相當設備及開友、倘範圍過小、農産品過少、則增加每單位之農産品、所需設備管理經營之成本、然亦不宜過大、因社員不易送繳農産品、勢必影響合作社之設備、預算及營業數量、估計不準、而使成本加重、至於運銷問題、恐非運銷合作之力所能勝任、應由分社組織聯合社、以處理運銷問題也、</p>
<p>Ｂ運銷合作社聯合社之組織　聯合社之功用、爲辦理分社社員、產品之運銷、故聯合社內、無需如合作社所有之加工設備、蓋聯合社僅作有效之廣告、並設法向各大城市市塲推銷、例如美國之全國棉花運銷合作社聯合社、AmericanCotton　Coopevative　Association及美國加州水菓運銷合作社聯合社、California　Frint　Growers　Exchange均爲聯合式之組織、後者所有之合作社、僅辦理收菓洗菓分等包裝等手續、而聯合社總機關之工作、即在設法推銷、及採取必要之廣告宣傳、與營業方針也、</p>
<p>Ｃ中央集權式運銷合作社之組織　集中式合作社與聯合社不同、聯合式之每一小台作社、均係獨立性質、隨時可與總機關脱離關係、惟集中式之合作社則不可、集中式合作之社員、散佈區域甚廣、其理事係由各區域之社員分别選出、合作社理事會、除執行全社中央機權外、復管理社內各區之各種業務、及設置各區所之包裝分級等事項、悉以中央機關之意旨爲轉移、</p>
<p>Ｄ聯合式與集中式之比較集中式合作社之政策、及經營管理、祇憑經理一人之意旨、可以命令方式、通知各區辦事處遵辦、無須得各區社員之同意、此種管理、如方法良善、則管理便利、運用自如、可收迅速之效、而聯合式之合作社則不然、不能施行命令式之管理政策、祇能從旁指導解釋、僅係顧問性質、因聯合之責任、僅在推銷，其他一切手續、均由各分社自由辦理、聯合社如有新政策新方法時、祗可勸告分社施行、而各分社須經過理事會之同意後、始能採行、此集中式與聯合式合作社之不同點也、（未完）</p>

<p>昨已訊結定九日宣判</p>
<p>轟動一時之甲北分屍案內要犯龔少亭與姘婦龔侯氏因妬奸將舊姘婦謝阿巧姐夤夜用繩勒斃、然後將首級砍落、埋屍閘北公興路龔少亭前開之龔鴻泰營造廠舊址處新建之平房下面、案發後、僅將無頭屍身起出、其頭顱迄無下落、起意犯龔侯氏·龔少亭·及帶同移屍之周保泉·李寶生等、則由市公安局偵緝隊先後拘獲、訊據供認謀斃謝阿巧姐不諱、並供出尚有實施凶犯沈福福在逃、奉飭移送地方法院、當經雷彬章檢察官訊明對於龔少亭·龔侯氏·兩犯以預謀殺人</p>

<p>被謀身死係由陳掌掌通知你的、所以命你往邀陳掌掌到庭、今日陳掌掌曾否同來、謝答、我與陳掌掌並無深交、不過同在一茶肆中吃茶認識而已、此事確由他告訴我的、但他現在多時未見他來吃茶、因此無由邀到、問、你私訴請求多少、答、六千元、問官命提龔少亭至案、問、死者有無親人、她祗有一阿姊、别無他人、問、你是那裏人、答、浦東高橋、問、上次供</p>
<p>死者捲逃時、你往蘇州去的、何以登報懸賞時、説你因事下鄉、顯見你所供前後不符、究竟你彼時在何處、答、實在有事前赴蘇州、因蘇州承接營造事務、所以時常赴蘇、問、你在公安局內供明謝阿巧實遭侯氏及你婿沈福福等謀死、答、寃枉的、因吃苦不起、是胡亂供的、官曰、然則何以爾等所指之處、適有屍體起出、與事實完全相符、龔語塞、次提龔侯氏至案、問、你爲何要謀死謝阿巧、答、並無其事、問、你在公安局供得很淸楚、現在你</p>

<p>— 穆藕初</p>
<p>日本的輸出貿易既爲其經濟的命脈，今日日貨到處遭遇排擠，於是就不得不轉向中國活動，而且中國市塲，本來與日本有着極密切的關係。兹將民國十九年日本對外貿易列表如次：</p>
<p>民國十九年日本對各國的輸出貿易（單位千元日幣）</p>
<p>國别　　　價值　　　　　　　百分比</p>
<p>中國　　　四○三、八五二　　二七·四三</p>
<p>美國　　　五○六、一一二　　三四·四三</p>
<p>歐洲各國　一二五、三六八　　八·五二</p>
<p>其他各國　四三五、○六○　　二九·五九</p>
<p>總計　　　一、四六九、八五八　一○○</p>
<p>我們所以拿民十九年的數字來做標凖的原因，是因爲此時日本尚來發動武力侵佔我東北四省，中日貿易處在常態的時候。但從表上看來，美日的貿易，依然在中國之上，不過美日貿易以生絲爲最多。日本運往美國的生絲，占其全輸出額百分之二十七，且占日本生絲的總輸出額百分之九十六。假如日本失掉美國市塲，除蠶絲業外、其他産業還不致受到任何影響，若失中國市塲，則日本産業全部，便受到莫大的打擊。（未完）</p>

<p>昨第一日李多二二二點</p>
<p>最後勝負須看今日兩戰</p>
<p>上海業餘甲組擊彈賽、爲全滬中西擊彈名家所參加、勝負所繫、錦標之歸、尊之曰上海彈王、名實相符、往昔逐鹿此寳座者、我國李公頴、葡人美廸那、本屆不然、所謂希望最濃厚之美廸那、乃遭我國名家張英達擊敗、昨日最後一幕之决賽、遂落於我國李公頴張英達手中、爲是項比賽以來所未有、良可自豪焉、</p>
<p>第一日奪標經過</p>
<p>决賽共計二千點、分二日舉行、各一千點、昨爲第一日、下午五時半開賽於維多利總會、張氏自擊敗美廸那以來、大露頭角、果然在十槍內、着着占先、頗能與彈王李公頴相頡頏、始終居導領地位、不料至三五五點、突告停止、斯時李公頴方以三零五落後、乘機連獲巨數、如六七、七六未幾反追出百餘點、終以五零零比三九三結束前局、後局自九時起、彼時李公頴之表演、較前精彩、張氏雖能力抗、究非老英雄之敵手、雙方比賽進行歷程中、李氏經騐宏富、每能盡量發揮其抱懷、然以各個人自身而論、張氏確有顯明進歩、李氏尚不及去歳之完美也、</p>
<p>且看今日分勝負</p>
<p>第一日結果、李氏乃以一千點比七七八占勝、今日尚有最後二塲、據各方觀察、李氏仍可保持彈王榮銜、但士别三日、刮目相視、張氏已能勝美廸那、安知必其不可克服李公頴乎、如以昨日前局前之三十槍而觀、張氏固在李氏之先、故希望雖有、尚須努力加鞭耳、昨日二人最高數點如左</p>
<p>李公頴　二八、三一、六二、四七、二六、三七、六七、七六、四六、三九、五一、三八、六六、三零、三二、三五、</p>

<p>看電車上的人們，擠在車頭上吹凉，或是緊閉了車門，防寒風進來，就可知道「春」與「秋」的在變更了。</p>
<p>都市是繁榮的，今年又是「兒童年」。可是，在這兒，我們却看到還有十二三歳的男孩子在拉人力車，十四五歲的女孩子在出賣靈魂，冷清清的馬路旁，更有一聲聲悲悽的賣小孩聲。</p>

<p>— 秋子</p>
<p>丘先生是怎麽樣的一個人呢？讓我來做個起碼的介紹。</p>
<p>丘先生是個三十左右的青年，在去年的冬季，就和他新夫人蔡女士新別來京，本來打算在京謀個差使，以便為社會國家服務，可奈戚屬毫無，逢迎非願，閑居京華，兩月將半，歲又更新，人還依舊，丘先生毫不作消極態度，自非一般時下青年可比。</p>
<p>丘先生是個百戰餘生，於今賦閑兩月，變爲『閑居軍官』。其性情可以説得上『静如處女，動如脱兎』八個字，他酷愛刺繡，説是比任何消遣方法爲有趣，在這兩月當中，計刺成兩對繡枕，手藝細膩，色調勻稱，內子及鄰婦均贊賞不置，謂爲『文武全材』，我獨謂『男女全材』。古人冬至詩有『日長一綫誰先覺輸與紅閨刺繡人』。于今紅閨隊裏，居然也有丘先生的芳蹤，真幸運兒哉！</p>
<p>他如裁衣縫衣補襪子等等，亦其所長，當其無事時候，常問我：『有襪子補没有』？至爲有趣。</p>
<p>最近兩個星期，潭兒放寒假歸，自己因上下午均須公出，丘先生又道地的權充家庭教師，有時還携潭兒到南京鷄鳴寺莫秋湖去學寫生。</p>
<p>丘先生居我家整整十個星期，於今丘先生已提着行裝進廬山軍訓團去了，春回大地，錦片前程，謹祝丘先生為國珍重！</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>一二八之後重建的上海北火車站，是挺雄偉的堡壘式的了。</p>
<p>在這堡壘式的車站裏，每天不知要吞吐若干由都市往農村，以及由農村往都市的人們，——在生活綫上掙扎的人們</p>
<p>當每一列火車離站之前，旅人們，有的是臉上露着輕鬆的微笑，有的是露着抑鬱的神情。當每一列火車進站之後，給火車吐出來的旅人們，一樣的有露着輕鬆的微笑，也有露着抑鬱的神情的。</p>
<p>在月台上，送行的戀人，往往是火車已給拖出了月台，還在不住地揚着花手帕。不錯，天下之最難堪者，別而已矣。但在火車進站的一刹那間，擁抱着候在月台上的心上人，邊談邊笑着捉對兒走出車站的旅人，那一份甜蜜的情意兒，是多麽的令人回味呀。</p>
<p>候車室裏的各個長椅上，永遠是那麽排列着就將離開這個都市的人們。但是，也儘有因無錢交付房租，而給房東太太驅逐出來的無家可歸的流浪者，在候車室裏，挨度着一個一個殘宵。</p>
<p>車站的外面，無論寒暑、無論日夜，無論晴雨，老是那麽縱横的排列着無數的洋車。每一個洋車夫，都是拉長着頸子，期待着用勞力，換取麵包。更其是列車進站的一剎那，誰都會在菜黄的臉上，泛出一絲兒笑意。</p>

<p>— 丁敏</p>
<p>近來老大國的藝浪狂掀，在蘇俄將有美男子梅蘭芳美女人胡蝶同了明星代表周劍雲夫婦等去發揚中國的戲劇和電影藝術。在南洋，已有美髯公張善孖負荷了黃社的委托，同了子姪們去展覧黃山攝影，詩，書，畫等多角藝術結晶品。我為了先覩為快起見，趕到張氏寓次，在他們檢點準備包裝的當兒，我一片片，一捲捲，欣賞了一遍；同時速記了幾首題贈張氏書畫上面的詩詞。</p>
<p>歸來，不敢專美，權充個郵差，無條件轉錄三首給各位，各位不妨意識自己是復活的古詩人，提高嗓子吟詠一番。原詩如次：</p>
<p>（一）黄賓虹題的：　斷壁苔陰綴青紫，鑿竇千尋步客趾；下瞰紀壑雲蒼茫，欲度不度魄爲　。喘汗捫崖一竚觀，遠迎西爽開孱顔；安得面山此長坐，平鋪松翠咸蒲團。騁思未已足轉進，歷險窮幽貪選勝，群峯拔地各爭奇，拔圖容我徐徐領。</p>

<p>— （放庵）（冰玉）</p>
<p>超山梅訊，獨擅勝塲。近據山中來客，告我新訊數端，誌之如下。</p>
<p>報慈寺香海樓新近落成。</p>
<p>冬行春令，羣玉山頭暗香已漸浮動，宋梅着花，尤如繁雪。</p>

<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>五萬年的蚤</p>
<p>東普魯士的白爾姆尼根地方，有琥珀採掘塲，一塊琥珀。琥珀中生有一蚤，照考古學家推算路來，是在五萬年前的。這蚤的形體，有米二粒大，因此這塊琥珀，認爲無價的珍寳。</p>
<p>人類百五十歳</p>
<p>莫斯科人命伸長研究所中，有科學家數人，極力研究長壽法，經研究的結果，人類都可活到百五十歳。他們從動物的成育期至成長後的狀况，用事實證明起來而判斷的。其延長生命的方法，即用內分泌液注射，以補助新陳代謝的機能，或用輸血手續，或用特别營養法，都能達到目的。</p>
<p>今年彗星出現</p>
<p>美國利克天文臺中的吉夫亞氏，發見今年有七八個彗星出現，其中有賴英德彗星，到了五月二日，即顯然可見。他如小遊星中的有名的第九四四號星，已有十四年不見，已於去年十月間，在南俄的西美司天文臺發見，其後通過近日點，預計三月五日，又可出現天空。</p>
<p>頭髮表明性格</p>
<p>倫敦有法國人經營的理髮店，這店中的理髮匠，能够把客人的頭髮形狀，辨别出其人的性格，與體質，大凡到這理髮店內去評判的，百發百中。有神經病的人，其髮，龍雜甚多，暴躁的人，其髮卷縮，有濕氣病的人，其髮色濃質硬，秃頭的人心多疑詐，命苦的人，其髮枯黄，剛直的人其髮細軟</p>
<p>伴母入獄求學</p>
<p>保加里亞的首都條非亞監獄中，有一寡婦，判處徒刑十個月，婦有女兒二人，願陪母同住獄中。但二女正在求學，請求獄長許其入校通學，如此早出晚歸，直至其母刑期滿後，始肯隨母返家。</p>
<p>奇異店面裝飾</p>
<p>敦倫牛津大街，有一家大寳石店商店，其櫉窗中，置有價值二千萬元的寳石，窗簷上嵌上五光十色的寳石數百粒。但爲預防竊賊起見，店門外駐有請願警十數名，晝夜看守實爲世界上未聞的富麗裝飾。</p>
<p>新案的摩登稅</p>
<p>保加利亞因爲地方財政窮乏，新案出摩登税數種，大凡女子燙髮一次，課税二元，畫眉塗唇美頰的女子，須向警察局，每月先納税三元，美爪施粉，每月三元，婦女未經納稅而美容者，如身邊未帶納税證書，一經查出，加課一倍。自施行新稅法以後，全國婦女，皆不願美容，這就是庽禁於征的新税法。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回　唐突女郎前露財選色覬覦墻隙裏爲病傷廉</p>
<p>錢這樣東西，能解决人生一切的困難問題。人生在世，誰都有若干問題，亟待解决，就不能不愛錢。若是那個人，並沒有超人的理智，决沒有可以得着錢而不要的至於理智，不够水平綫的人，只要得着錢，那就可以什麽都肯幹。這不能怪人，這是各人的環境所逼迫的。這時的朱胡氏，到了窮途末路，便是兩三個大銅子，可以買方鍋塊充飢，對他也有莫大的帮助。現在桌上放了許多洋錢，張介夫説，只要他心理活動一下，這些洋錢都是他的，他聽到之後，不能不身子一陣抖顫，問道：張老爺，你…你…你這是啥話？張介夫向月英看了一眼，接着道：你們是老實人，我還能拿話來騙你嗎？假如你心裏活動一下，這些洋錢，立刻就是你的了。胡氏向桌子角上看去，見那洋錢，雖是被紙蓋着了，可是還看很出半角白汪汪的光彩在外面。他說了，假如心裏一活動，這洋錢立刻就是我的了。莫非呌我搶了這些洋錢就跑。我走也走不動，我怎麽能跑？而且這小西天裏，地方很大，我走進來了，連東西南化都分不出來，又叫我怎樣跑得出去呢？他如此想着，手扶了桌子，就不免三起三落，眼神全都射在那桌子角上。張介夫看了他那情形，倒不解是什麽用意，因道：這位大嫂，你聽見我説了没有，假使你心裏活動一下，這些洋錢，立刻就是你的了（一四八）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「他們都在車子的那一邊啊？」伊向李蓮英問着。</p>
<p>「都在左邊！太后！」李的答復。</p>
<p>車子是進站了，速率已减到了最低的程度，太后便慢慢地從伊的御座上走下來，靠着左邊的車窗，臉向了外面站着，其餘的人都留在原位上，不敢妄動，這時，光緒尚在他自己的車中；太后便特地教我站在伊的背後，——這個位置原該是光緒的。——我當然十分樂從，且喜我的身量恰比伊高一些，正好可以隔着伊的肩膀，看淸楚外面的一切情形。這情形和我們來的時候所見的完全相同：許多的官員，大隊的兵丁，以及月台上的燈綵，一些也没有改變；而袁世凱本人，也仍然是跪得比衆人略上一步，顯示着他的領袖的身份。太后看了這一幅慢慢地在伊面前移轉着的活動佈景，不由微微一笑；可是那些官員正把頭低到了地上，恭恭敬敬地在向伊行禮，自然是不曾見到伊這一笑的。我雖站在伊的肩後，却還能從伊的嘴角上見到；這一笑誠然是異常的溫和慈愛，但也無從遮掩的透露了伊的疲憊和勞倦。我對於伊這一笑所感受到的影象，委實是很深刻的，至今還在我的腦神經上遺留着。</p>
<p>本書第十四章裏不是説過袁世凱有一隊西樂隊，給太后帶到了奉天去嗎？當時原説是暫借的，因此慶善這班管事的人早就想到了，就由他們吳咐下去，讓那一班西樂隊在天津下車。（二五九）</p>

<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>這時候，能够「樂以忘憂」的絶少，真能如此的也多半是無「憂」或其「憂」非憂的人們。在新年，「我們有殺牲口，接財神的市儈；有乘佳節，作雅集的書生；有釘着女人摜摜砲的英雄；有立在馬路邊拍手叫好的清客，」以全於逛跑狗塲買獨贏，到百樂門跳却而斯登的洋塲遺少，他們真個有過「憂」麽？有的，這許是醋海風波的煩惱，而這些撈什子「憂」也實在是可以「樂」而忘之的。如果爲了這便責備他們忘記「國難」，「好了創疤忘了痛」——何况創疤其實尚不曾好——也還是「隔膜」而已，他們的有些人，也還自以為是「不後人」呢，因為他們着實也有些是穿着「國貨」的。何况現在，實際上也並沒有什麽「創疤」。</p>
<p>「在創痛中能忘了痛尋一點開心」，這只有在那些自以為創痛並不大，或竟全然沒有，却又在臉孔上裝着真的好像有什麽創痛似的人們才做得來，他們沒有創痛，或者「其創」甚小，逛了一兩次跑狗塲，摟了一下舞女，到夜裏三點鐘時候，讓汽車載着疲憊的身子回到家裏，爬上床，明早也就可以忘個一乾二净了。</p>
<p>在都市，破產者的暗泣，與外強中乾惟恐被人看出弱點的强顏歡笑，的確是給無綫電收音機裏的「桃花江」「妹妹我愛你」的溫柔的歌聲，和得意者的哄笑掩沒了的。至於在鄉下，不但沒有元宵，簡直連「新年」也沒了。「憂」是有的，而且並不是「樂」可以忘得掉的，就是有了什麽「樂」，也攪不起這一團高興，何況事實上連足以忘憂的「樂」也沒有！</p>
<p>在元宵時候，誰曾見過討飯的癟三，在弄堂口跳却而斯登。在「藥以忘憂」麽？我只曾見過從破產的江北農村逃到這繁榮的都會裏來的」叫化」，釘着高貴的少婦，——然而並不是摜摜砲，而是要個把銅板，但得到的，却祇是那個的縐縐眉頭，一二聲「屈死」！</p>
<p>可見「樂以忘憂」的人們，究竟很少，不是無論什麽人都能够辦到的。</p>
<h3 id="c189">又是「雜文」 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 林希雋</p>
<p>並答唐弢先生</p>
<p>先前無意之間寫了一篇「雜文與雜家」（刋現代去年九月號文藝獨白上）表示自己對於這現象的一點兒管見—始終是管見而已，不敢自擬高論。却想不到竟因此激動一般人的公憤，一時明槍時劍大施攻打，没曾預料到那些話會去觸着人們的瘡疤。而人們之劍拔弩張也正是不爲無因的，且自己又没有「兩個人就成一系，三個人就成一派」的組織來作靠背，就祇好讓「英勇的將士」們獨當一面，一逕的沈默下來了。</p>
<p>滿以為從此可以平静無事，可是「英雄」們的火燄是一直向前伸張着，似乎是一輩子也燃燒不完，這其間有某大雜誌的座談上，就是永遠忘不掉這「痛恨」似的，接三連二的放射着不知多少次的冷箭。</p>
<p>到現在不得不來嘵一回嘴了。</p>
<p>早已就偶爾間翻着讀書生活一篇也是唐弢先生所作題名為「雜文與廚司」的大文，也還是襲用着「英雄」們慣用的冷箭式的技倆，對於我射來幾支「毒箭」。如今，在自由談上復見到唐弢先生的「談雜文」，唐弢先生那麽一再出頭打抱不平，其為「雜文」萬歳主義者，大概是沒有疑問的吧。</p>
<p>不過唐弢先生這回並未曾完全看清楚登在最近文藝畫報，「再多些和再少些」的拙文的原意，而祗是截取一二片段來作攻擊的資料，這種態度我是不敢苟同的。</p>
<p>在過去的兩篇短文裏，我已復返地說過，「時下所流行着的雜文，其所觸及的範圍與取材的廣泛，幾乎是包羅了時事的，國際的，政治的各種社會問題都有，差不多無殊於新聞紙上那種評論文章」，而亦誠如唐弢先生的說法一樣，「雜文的確不像小説，詩歌，戲劇」。同時正是與非文藝作品的其也各科論文和記叙，簡直絶無軒輊之分，勉强算它有「少許」的文藝性質還是不可能的。但在此我要鄭重伸明，我决不是一個形式主義的機械論者，也從未説除了小説或戲劇等文藝著作之外旁的文章都要不得，倘若不是浪費，依然有其另一方面的義意和效果的。（如政治經濟等其他各門類的論文）這，猶之乎某大雜誌的「座談」上所謂「雜文，在這一年來是特別地負了重大的責任的」的偏見，單獨抬出雜文來，一若過去一年間整個文壇真是捨開雜文而外，就無有旁的作品值得記載，（其實雜文是不能算仿文藝作品而看成了文壇的收獲。）這顯然不是抹殺事實．別具用心？不錯過去一年「雜文」確是莫明其妙的在興盛着，但寫得優秀（假使有存在的價值的話）的根本便很少見到，若有所謂寫得好的，我想大概就在於用來做人身攻擊這一點功夫上，有什麽偉大的地方，我可不相信。而現今要求偉大的作品的呼聲喊得極其起勁，於是便有人樂觀地告訴我們，「它（指雜文）是不遠的偉大的作品到來的潛修時代」。好在「不遠」將會「到來」，暫時也無妨跟預言家樂觀一下以等着這個不遠偉大的作品的降臨。然而，我總要懷疑那許是一種無限期的空頭支票。</p>
<p>我沒有那麽利害的權威去阻止「雜文家」埋頭於「它是不遠的潛修時代」「偉大作品」的比一切「更好」的工作的工作，也沒有天大的本領來撲滅，這些是「非常需要」的「雜文」，唐弢先生儘管不必過慮吧，未來的事都是難臆斷的，我們試拭目以待之。</p>

<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>澳門的初春是那麽溫暖的。輕微的風飄襲着旅人的心頭，那充着西洋氣味兒的哪！高爽的山崗上，排列着美麗的房子，一幢一幢地在士敏土的倒斜路矗立着。在青葱的常綠葉樹的空間裏，隱隱約約可以瞧到紅綠的瓦尖，幽静地，疏遠地有一些不怕冷的小鳥兒啾唱，煽起我的情懷：</p>
<p>美麗和可愛的春天來臨了。</p>
<p>澳門的市塲永遠的在狂熱的進行呢。</p>
<p>在澎湃的南海的岸上，一條一條的大街小巷，遠遠地充塞着囂張的聲音，昏狂的銀牌館，有着無數的人們要把昏迷的腦袋埋喪在白的銀子，有色素的錢票的深層，他們等到了沒有可能生存的時候便把生命抛進狂濤裏，悄悄地，跟着又來一批一批懷着莫大的慾望的賭徒在擠着，從白天到黑夜，從春天到冬天，老是不停地在歪的生活的圈子裏掙扎着。</p>
<p>那兒，雖藴藏着深深的人間底悲哀，可是，大部分的人們都在狂歡，裸胸露臂的歌妓有着迷人的肉體，她們把從生活的圈子裏擠了出來的年輕人失戀者們妖迷着。到了金錢的魔鬼殘酷地鞭笞着，她們又裝着苦笑的臉兒，也許帶着悲哀的同情心地把他們送到碧綠的海濤裏去了。然而，跟着又是一群一羣的男人們迷進那芬馥的層圍裏，等到她們給生活的鞭子剝掠得再不能生存的時候，那麽急速地又來了一帮一帮的農村姑娘，永遠地的在悲切的狂歡的進行曲裏沉喪！</p>
<p>那兒有着無數的骷髏，永遠地埋在黑漆的屋子吸着那吃人的骨髓的雅片烟。那兒有着高爽的跳舞塲，有權威的人們在抱着嬝娜的女人們底輕腰跳到天亮。</p>
<p>然而呀！罪惡之城！只是容納了失意的富豪底總塲！永遠地在滾盪着，終有一天，他會給烘烘的海水埋葬了的吧。</p>
<h3 id="c191">談自己的畫 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 子愷</p>
<p>「色彩子愷新年漫畫」</p>
<p>開明書店發行的中學生雜誌今年一月號，附送一張用中國紙彩色印的我所畫的立幅，叫做「色彩子愷新年漫畫」。我在廣告上看到這個叫稱，覺得好笑，因爲自己被兩個形容詞夾住了，擺在一個名詞上面，似覺有些兒不自然。</p>
<p>然而我不敢怪這名稱的不自然。因為我的畫比者名稱更不自然，這立幅簡直是畫錯的！</p>
<p>數萬的中學生讀者，大概都没有發見我的畫的錯處。不然，何以一兩個月來只有寄宣紙來向我素立幅的信，而不見指摘我這立幅的錯誤的信呢？又何以有人肯拿這立幅去裝裱，使這錯誤的畫也會高揭在裱畫店裏的壁上呢？但也許不然：早已有人看出這立幅的畫錯，在那裏議論。不過他們不屑，不願，或不便用文字宣布出來使我坍臺。</p>
<p>但我似乎不需要臺，在這裏自己拆坍了：我這立幅是畫錯的；至少，是畫得很笨拙的。容我自白：</p>
<p>畫錯在什麽地方呢？請看這幅畫：近景是岸，岸上有一株長松。遠景也是岸，岸上有半個朝暾透出在地平線上，正在發射光芒，驅逐那上面的雲翳。中景是一葉小舟，靠近此岸，正在向着彼岸的朝暾進發。畫錯的就在這地方。請看那船裏，共有四個人，兩個穿童子軍裝的青年，一個坐在船頭，一個坐在船尾。還有兩個少女，並坐在船艙中。他們都面向着朝暾，背向着觀者；他們都在打槳。船尾的人右手持槳的中部，左手持槳的柄端，他是以槳代舵的。其餘三個人的槳，中部都繫住在船舷上。三人大家用兩手執持柄端而一俯一仰地推扳。朋友告訴我：「你畫錯了！這三人都在倒扳槳，這船不能達到光明的彼岸，却在那裏向後退了」！不錯，這三支槳是合槓杆作用的。中部繫住在船舷上的是支點。柄端是力點。入水的槳葉是重點。把槳葉伸入水中而扳進槳柄，船當然向後退，退到撞破在此岸上。這真是很大的錯誤了。</p>
<p>然而我可以辯：他們三人都是「推槳的」，不是「扮槳的」。推槳者，當槳葉入水時，把槳柄向前推，出水時向後扳。船也會前進。圖書不像電影地能顯示過去未來的動作，你安知船頭上俯着的青年不是剛才推盡一槳而是正在開始扳進一槳呢？你又安如道船艙裏仰着的兩少女不是正在開始推槳而是剛才扳盡一槳呢？</p>
<p>朋友笑了一笑，告訴我：「你的手通年拿筆桿，沒有拿過槳，不知此中甘苦。這強辯分明是無用的。你知道麽：推槳很吃力，進行又很遲緩，且扳進時槳葉出水而在空中，輕飄飄的：身體若不用勁，容易向後翻倒。聰明的舟人决不肯取這划法。即使你的話不錯，這船裏的青年少女們都是「出力不討好」的笨人。我告訴你：你應該教他們「向後轉」，面向着觀者，而背向着光明。這樣，既可省力，又可速達，還可以用笑嘻嘻的臉孔來討好觀者，豈非一舉三得麽！」</p>
<p>我聽了這話，恍然若悟。次日起一個早，跑到湖邊雇一隻船，把船頭向着朝暾，就親自來演習這推槳的工作。果然覺得很吃力，很遲緩，一不用勁，又很容易翻倒。而且又被船老大笑，他忠告我：「先生，你調轉來，把屁股向着太陽光，舒服得多呢！」我曾經一度聽從他的勸告；但立刻又調轉來，情願出力不討好。因為我在舒服之後，發覺一大缺憾，就是不見了太陽，背向了光明。屍股上不生眼睛，心中時時着急，不知我的船是否對正了光明之路而前進？因此我寗願吃力些，遲緩些，用勁些，而仍取我的划法。由聽别人笑我笨拙罷。只要能面向着光明前進，我心就安。這時候我悟到了向朝暾划船的兩條哲理：你倘要省力，要速成，要舒服，要不被人笑，須得背光明。你倘要向光明，只得吃力一點，遲進一點，用一點勁，再被人笑幾聲。</p>
<p>啊！我這立幅畫錯了！對不起印刷工人和書店，要他們花費許多工本來印送，還在其次。第一是對不起讀坃：這畫上寫明「二十四年元旦為中學生讀者作，」彷彿是在恭喜發財的元旦勸青年吃力，遲進，用勁，又被人笑。這是何等重大的罪過！因為現在的世間，實利第一，大家盡量地求省力，求速成，求舒服。誰肯為了一些吃不得的光明而趕出力不討好的事呢？</p>
<p>當這立幅還未印刷的時候，原有善意的友人指摘這畫中的事實的錯誤。但我固執地不聽，就把畫發表了。「一言既出，駟馬難追。」何况數萬張「色彩子愷新年漫畫」的立幅交郵差分送到數萬讀者的案頭，而我又並沒有一匹駑馬，怎樣追得回來呢？讓我錯到底，笨到底罷。不但在這裏自白了我的錯和笨，又在這裏登了一個潤例的廣告，開始賣我那種錯和笨的畫。這篇文章也可説是廣告的廣告。</p>

<p>扶着桌立了起來，桌子左右地摇了摇，桌上碗碟琤琤琮琮地響起，大肚子也退到床上去，高凸着肚子攤手攤脚地睡着了。</p>
<p>沙發上的步行家，在醉夢中全以為這碗碟聲是什麽音樂的聲音，反感地揮起手來，作一個拉凡珴琳底姿勢。「好的，好的，親愛的姑娘呀！你跳一個華爾兹舞吧！我來拉琴。呵；呵！呼呼……」翻了一個身，不禁嘔吐了。</p>

<h3 id="c194">甘地反對老翁結婚 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 丁</p>
<p>前日哈瓦斯電，印度孟買有一年六十歳之印度老富翁，不日將與十三齡之少女結婚，聖雄甘地，特為此事，電國民大會，表示抗議，謂耒成年之少女，嫁一花甲老翁，殊屬不合，甘地並命其信徒，設法抵製，甘地真是一個好事之徒，善於惡作劇者。</p>
<p>印度女子，本來早熟，十三歲叫娘，原不是一件希罕的事，并且那個老翁，又是多錢，該女子自然是情願嫁給他的，即以法律言之，枯楊生花，並為法律所許，甘地何苦定要去干涉他們的美事，真是吹縐一池春水，干卿底事。</p>
<p>就是以該女立場言，亦無甚失策，男子死了老婆，可以再娶，女子死了老公，天然可以再醮，印度的法律，雖未經調查，諒亦不外如此，既經這樣，老翁倘然死了，女子儘可再嫁，即使不高興嫁，則亦有的是錢，不失為富家之婦，本有名正言順的大道可走，此外通融辦法很多，可不必說。</p>
<p>甘地真是一個不是安份守己的傢伙，偏偏要去干涉，電國民大會，表示抗義，不算，還命其信徒，設法抵制，務使白髮紅顔，廋克締成良緣，這是什麽緣故？在一九三一年時，曾發生一件相類的事，締婚之日，甘地信徒，組織一送殯的儀仗，沿途相送，加以調侃現在甘地的信徒，本知舊事重演，還是要花樣翻新，則尚在不可知之數。</p>
<p>不過天下極不人道的事和極不合乎情理的事甚多，而往往爲法律所不能禁止，在這種情形之下，亦惟有用非常手段對付，甘地身處大英帝國殖民地領土之下，無法抵抗，只有提倡無抵抗主義，不合作主義，以相對付，帝國主義倒也無法加以裁制，現在甘地亦用此法來干涉老翁結婚，真是同一手法。</p>
<p>猶憶滿淸時，非有品級，不能戴全紅風兜，有某太守初到任，見該地紳士階級，多戴全紅風帽，但若輩多是紳士階級，又不好和他們認真，命令取締，因前淸時的紳士階級自有一種特殊勢力，未便輕於得罪，這種勢力，至今還有相當存在，某太守心生一計，乃做數百個全紅風帽，分給乞丐，此風遂絶。</p>
<p>可知戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同，世界不合情理的事，自有不合情理的辦法來對付，在法律失其效力之下，自有特别的方法足以救濟也。</p>

<p>— 小紅</p>
<p>朋友，你不是説過「雖然環境使你如此，但是總得保重身體」的話嗎？現在你怎樣呢？滿紙的灰色，滿紙的苦悶。</p>
<p>説起來，我的環境是比你更惡劣得多，我的苦悶，比你更重的，但是我寧願把它深深的堤在心底的。用最大的力量去克服它，在我的面前懸起一點希望，我就擒着淚珠抱着殘缺的心向這希望進軍，雖然我屢次的受着嚴重的打擊，連這一點微微的希望都不能實現。</p>
<p>有時候，我也同樣的會像你那樣的泛起「怎樣做人」和「人生是什麽」的想頭，但是我可時常常説笑那般的「是爲情人的媚笑」，「是爲情人的……」把它想開了。</p>
<p>雖然，怪可憐的，到現在爲止，我還没有　　一個情人，可是我在苦悶的時候可還是時常用這一個近乎玩笑的想頭來醫療，我的創傷，用這一個近乎玩笑的想頭來鼓起我失敗後的餘勇。</p>
<p>真的，到現在，我一方面盡情的在</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>享樂，一方面也更鼓勵我自己，至少，我以爲，在這個世界上，我還有愛護我的自己，我的年紀正輕，我還有正要幹的事情，我爲什麽要意志消沉起來？我憑什麽要意志消沉起來！</p>
<p>朋友看到我儘情的享樂，都説我變了，有一位朋友更好意地對另一位朋友説：「×，當心小紅的自殺，你看他變得這麽的厲害」。</p>
<p>當朋友告訴我這樣的話時，我不由得感謝起朋友的好意來，同時，我感到受了莫大的侮辱，那位值得感謝的朋友正是太小看我了，他以爲我在人生的戰壕中受到幾次失敗便會背着人自殺起來，他更因爲看到我近來儘情的享樂而患着杞人之憂，朋友，我是不會自殺的，我或許會殺人，或許我會被殺，但是，我决不會用自己的手來結束我自己的生命。</p>
<p>要是説我的儘情享樂便是在實行「慢性自殺」，那麽我要請問：在受到不斷的打擊中，難道不允許一個人用娱樂來解救暫時的痛苦，難道不允許一個人用娱樂來作爲對事業的行軍歌嗎？不然，請封閉起體力勞働者的嘴吧，他們在工作時候，不是就在哼着「杭唷！杭唷！」</p>
<p>你説，你的朋友都冷淡了你，而你到現在，也可惜着失去了許多朋友的愛祇換到一個人的靈魂，你好像感到了這世界的狹窄而苦痛了。</p>
<p>朋友冷淡你，或許是你的多心，但或許是真的，不過，朋友爲什麽要冷淡你呢？因爲你獲得了一個靈魂而失望了嗎？對這樣的朋友的去，真是該自己向自己慶賀的事，爲什麽再感到苦悶。至於旁的朋友好像都疏遠了，你又感到了離羣的悲哀。其實，你不是自己已經説過，「朋友的親疏是並不建在往來的親疏上的」。</p>
<p>朋友，别那麽善病多感了，自己寛慰自己一下吧，自己去找一個解除苦悶的東西，在這個年頭，這樣的世界裏，我們這樣的人，誰没有一肚子的苦悶呢？</p>
<p>况且，你還有一個獲得了的「靈魂」呢，你退一歩想，要是連這個「靈魂」都失去該怎麽辦？這世界上，空空洞洞而生存着的人多着呢！</p>
<p>朋友，爲明日的自己着想，把那些苦悶像抛棄一個烟蒂似的扣了吧。</p>

<p>現在我雖然是一個學徒，但是我的求學的熱心，並没有改變，我很希望能够達到我的慾望。所以我常常懇求家庭，想恢復我的求學生活。可是，結果終是失望！同時，我父親因爲我反抗了他的意見，不聽也的話，對我非常不滿，那種嚴厲的態度實在使人難受。在這樣的情况下，我便發生了一種不好的理想：我想脱離家庭的束縛，獨立生活。第一我覺得我所以不能求學的原因，完全是受家庭的壓廹，假使没有家庭的阻止，我或者可以達到求學的目的。同時，父親的態度又太使我失望了。</p>
<p>不過，我雖然有這種理想，可是又没有這種力量來實行，而且那慈祥的祖母和母親，我怎肯離開她們呢？所以我左思右想，實在爲難極了。親愛的先生！如何能完成我的讀書的志向呢？如何脱離家庭而不受痛苦呢？請你指導我！敬請　撰安　王紹高敬上</p>
<p>編者按：在這經濟恐慌的年頭，一般人的生活都發生了嚴重的問題，那有餘錢來供子女求學呢？所以王君先要詳細的觀察一下；家庭有没有繼續供給學費的能力。假使由於經濟困難阻止你入學，那末你要原諒他們，因爲絶不能爲了你個人讀書，而使他們餓死啊。</p>
<p>你現在不能達到求學的慾望，以及父親的嚴厲的態度，就想脱離家庭，這是一種極錯誤心理。請問你：你脱離家庭後，難道就有求學的能力嗎？你現在能够自立嗎？</p>
<p>至於父親所以待你不好的原因，大概是由於你反抗了他的意見。但我們想：到了他的氣消了以後，他還是愛護你的。那時你再説明理由，懇求他給你求學，也許可以達到你的目的。因爲天下只有父母最能原諒子女的。並且，現在父親雖然很嚴厲，但你還有慈祥的祖母和母親，她們待你一定是很好，你絶不能因爲暫時的憤慨，而失去你的和愛的家庭啊！</p>
<p>關於求學的一點，我們認爲在服務的時候，也就是在求學；一切的實際經騐，就是你的學問，你可以利用職業的餘暇，努力從事自修的工作，日久一定會有進歩。所以我們勸你不要因爲不能在學校讀書而覺得痛苦和失望。</p>

<p>— 陳宏鐸譯</p>
<p>（一）空心混凝土樁之製法</p>
<p>美國M　issouri　Pacific鐵路，建造一橋梁時，採用一種新法，以製造鋼骨混凝土樁，使其重量减輕，並在同一之重量時，而得較大之樁面摩擦力，樁之斷面，成八角形，徑二十四時，空心直徑十吋，有一樁長三十六呎，全長皆空心，尖端開口處做平，另一樁，尖端部份，則係實體，直幹爲空心，伸至樁頂</p>
<p>樁在打入最後一呎時，雖有一百五十次之錘擊，樁頭並未損壞，按諸打樁紀錄，一樁打入後，泥土擠入空心內十四呎八吋，樁在未到達堅硬地層前，其錘打遠易於實體之混凝土樁。</p>
<p>空心之製成，係用一伸縮橡皮管，受氣力或水力而澎漲至規定之直徑，同時長度减少，混凝土結硬後，將橡皮管抽出之。</p>
<p>（二）新式空心屋面混凝土板塊</p>
<p>此種板塊，係以石棉水泥製造，長六呎寛二呎六吋，用於平屋頂或坡度甚小之屋面，板塊係空心，故可防止熱與聲之傳達，重量不大，兩人即可搬運之。</p>
<p>板塊放置後，横縫互相啣接，直縫則貫以水泥漿，若板塊架於桁梁，亦可利用爲工作之平台。在板塊上面，未舖油毛毡或柏油之前，已成遮蓋屋面，足以防止雨水之浸入，使其他工作，提早進行，殊爲便利。</p>
<p>（三）新式防火混凝土地板</p>
<p>此種新式防火混凝土地板，以其建造之迅捷，及拱架之簡單著稱，其構造係空心，一面閉口，裝置時空口相接，成十八吋方之板塊，有如封口之箱，厚度自四吋半至九吋不等。兩平行邊之下突緣，較其本身，略爲伸出，裝置時，使兩塊之突緣相接，所成之空隙，放置直鋼條，閉口端之下突緣，亦同此相接，以置横鋼條，此種混凝土板塊，多就地製造之。</p>
<p>拱架用十六號鋼板銲製之，其中部斷面成三角形，計有三種尺寸，以適合不同之跨度。搬運，裝置及折缷，俱甚便利。拱架之腹材，在末端處割去，突緣留二吋長七吋半寛之支承面積，以傳遞載重於磚牆或其他支撑之上，拱架兩端，各留一空眼，以便插入工具，將其伸長部份拉回，如是地板完工後，即可將拱架折缷。</p>
<p>此種拱架之特殊便利處，即在中間，無須支撑，故地板下未有阻礙，其他工作得以進行，</p>
<p>拱架中心距離爲十八吋，因其簡單故，百方碼之地板面積，可於一句鐘內裝置完畢，然後放置空心混凝土板塊，再加横直鋼條於所成之空隙，貫入細混凝土，成爲肋材，必要時上面再加一層混凝土，經四日後，即可將拱架按前述方法拆去，板塊排放後，即成爲工作之平台，殊爲便利。</p>
<p>板之雙方，俱備鋼條，故載重之分佈面積較大，安全率亦較高，據試騐結果，按每方呎載重百磅設計之地板，以五噸之重量，集中於四方呎之面積，其垂度在十五呎跨度之中央，僅爲二十分之一吋，載重移去後，板即恢復原狀。再者用雙向鋼條，平頂亦少破裂，故更爲適用，此種混凝土板塊，不若空心磚之能變形，且易塗幔泥灰。</p>
<p>板塊之厚度，可以變更，上面另加之混凝土層，厚度亦可增减，藉以適合地板各種不同之載重。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>店舖房屋或小範圍商業區房屋。近年以來。在建築事業上。已佔到極重要的地位。我們把美國作一個例子。那麽在過往一年之中。各營造廠所訂的合同。上面這種房屋。佔居了百分之五十以上。中國雖然商業比較落後。但在都市之中。店舖房屋在建築事業上。當然也佔有極重要的地位。商店習慣的疾速變遷。以及近年工商業的高速發展。直接間接。都可使店舖房屋時常要拆造或翻新。</p>
<p>商店的形式。在積極的使其現代化。結果使店舖房屋便不得不時常要造過。而建築這種房屋的時候。所用的金屬。玻璃。木料。以及各種新的建築材料，已是普遍的應用了。新式商店的燈光。也和過往不同。每用反光作用來引路過人的注目。因此。在各地大都市中。店舖和商業區的翻造改建。已在疾速的擴大。同時工商業的發展。使目前有限的店屋。不敷應用。結果。也足使店屋和商業區的新建。</p>
<p>就爲了商店的現代化和商業區的展長。使都市之中。雖是彈丸之地。也要建築商市。不過我們建築市房。事前基地的選擇。也應加以注意。第一歩要分析當地的情形。這個地位。行人和車輛是否熱鬧。如果是熱鬧的話。那麽我們便可去利用這塊基地。等到基地覓妥之後。開始建築的時候。我們便要注意到廚窗裏面。商品的陳列。和店堂裏職員工作的地方。是否支配得當。一條走路。自然要留出。事實上現代的商店。店舖房屋在建築的時候。一切工作。包括木工。土工。石工。水門泥工等。都和過往不同。</p>
<p>專門的建築家。對於市房的建築。應得面面顧到。房屋建成而後。是否適合當地的環境。當地電力公司。電燈公司所供給的電力如何。電燈。反光燈。年紅燈。在這店舖之中。應如何裝置。這些都是應由建築師負責規劃的。爲了一個都市之中。人口在疾速的增加起來。住宅區當然也隨着人口而在擴大。人口一多。本來的中心市塲。勢必不便供應。所有的住宅區。那麽在中心市塲的四周。自然要建設二等市塲。這種市塲。所處的位置如何。環境如何。四周的住宅。那些居民的等級如何。假如都是富有的人家。店舖房屋自然要造得神氣一些。反之。都是平民。那麽比較可馬虎一些。</p>
<p>近年以來。都市之中。店舖的裏面。失火的事件。我們時常會聽到。而且爲了商店裏面。商品的堆積。每多易於着火的東西。所以一起火就不堪收拾。甚至會遺燒多家。關於這點。我們在建築市房的時候。防火問題。自然應格外注意。可能的話。房屋應用鋼骨水泥建成。連得門窗也以採用鋼骨爲宜。甚至扶梯也應用鐵欄石級。不可能。引火的木料。那麽少用一些好一些。而防火的設備。更應顧到呢。</p>

<p>第五節　建築材料之試騐</p>
<p>材料試騐之目的，在乎求得該項材料性質之特點，是否盡能適合理想中所需之一切，而藉以斷定取捨之標準。</p>
<p>普通試騐之門徑，大别有二：曰化學法之與機械法是也。</p>
<p>一，化學試騐法：是法可由少量之貨樣中，去求其成份所含之各種質量，而所有各項不利不需之雜物，亦可即此檢出。</p>
<p>二，機械议騐騐法：是法可試出材料所具之力能，彈性，及其他上文所述各種材料特性。</p>
<p>此外，吾人待諸經騐豐富時，雙手兩目，亦自能審定判斷，材料特性優劣之一斑，厮則僅爲方便計，非正當法也</p>
<p>第二章　生鐵</p>
<p>第一節　鐵礦</p>
<p>鐵礦爲礦物之一，其礦之純粹者，成份當爲氣化鐵類；而生鐵即自此種鐵礦中提去氧氣而成。鐵礦之高下，以其所含鐵質之多寡而判定之，凡含鐵質在百分之五十以上者，是爲高等，而百分之五十以下者，是爲次等，至其他雜質之常混於鐵礦中者，有硫，燐，矽硅等質。均爲生鐵中之所不宜有者。</p>
<p>第二節　生鐵之製造</p>
<p>爲欲使鐵礦中之氧氣淸除，故宜用碳質以還原，此項碳質可自燃料煤炭中得之；又因鐵礦多含雜質，故復須用石灰石爲媒介，使雜質連合提净。至製造之方法，用鼓風爐（Blast　Furnace），一座，焦炭，灰石，鐵礦，等要件，其歩驟爲</p>
<p>（一）取生鐵，焦炭，灰石，交互間隔舖設鼓風爐中，其厚薄之比例爲生鐵3/6，焦炭3/8，及灰石1/8。而爐温須在華氏一千度。</p>
<p>（二）自鼓風爐爐底，以冷空氣打入，約須有每方吋十五磅之壓力。</p>
<p>（三）於是焦炭中之碳質，乃吸取氧氣而化爲一氧化碳，再與鐵礦之熱氧相合成二氧化碳，而使生鐵下沉爐底，而流出爐外。</p>
<p>（四）礦中雜質與灰石相合，而成硬塊（Slag）浮在爐面。</p>
<p>如是每小時放氣一次，若以鐵礦一千噸，焦炭五百噸，灰石三百噸及空氣二千噸之消耗論，每六小時可出生鐵五百噸。（未完）</p>

<p>丈桿——不論木匠或泥水匠對於開間的長短闊狹所應用的一種丈量尺寸的木桿。大概用一寸二寸的洋松料做成。它的作用可以抵當普通用英呎省時間和少手續。</p>
<p>簷油木——（Wooden　Plste）擱栅和承重的放置地位之下。必需先擺一塊簷油木。作用是平均重量的壓力中心。</p>
<p>凡水——（Flashing）屋面舖瓦的山墻邊或水落斜溝的地位。用鉛皮包捲於墻身內或木條上的。這呌凡水。它有踏歩凡水（Step　Flashing）和落底凡水（Groove　Flashing）之别。</p>
<p>落水管——（Water　Pipe）在簷口旁用以接引水量到溝渠裏去的鉛皮管子或熟鐵管子。</p>
<p>水斗——（Lead　Head）防止從屋面衝下的雨水。不容易立刻瀉進管子。而漲滿在天溝內流出外面的一種水箱。（Water　Box）</p>
<p>明溝——（Surface　Drain）亦稱陽溝。在地面上露出的可以導水入溝渠的水槽。</p>
<p>瓦筒——（Drain　Pipe）亦稱陰溝。在地底下的溝渠。是排洩水量的管子。</p>
<p>十三號——（Gully）明溝和瓦筒間的一種緩衝的設備。好像天溝和水落管間的水斗。</p>
<p>天窗——（Main　Hole）是一種緩衝的設備。防止瓦筒的水量過急。使之有停頓的預防法。</p>
<p>托綫板——（Plumb　Board）形狀像一支尖形的箭。尾部有凹進的相义。可以掛綫垂。用以糾正墻身的「衝」「免」的用具。</p>
<p>水棺材——（Level　Box）是一種簡單的粗糙的測量器。它是用整塊木料。中間挖空。將水放進空擋內。再用丁字形木板三塊。倒置水面上。用眼睛望在三塊木板的上端直綫上。就可以測量遠處的瞄凖物了。</p>

<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（八）最初幾個電影明星的事</p>
<p>上一節我已講過「好萊塢」最初的命義，以及怎樣一位失業無聊的佈景師，羅伯勃隆登，發現好萊塢的經過。到了一九一六年。好萊塢已經成了電影世界的中心點，除去了幾家不足輕重的小公司，因爲各别的原因，還散處在各地繼續工作之外，所有重要的大公司，統通都已齊集在好萊塢。再過了幾年，全世界的目光，亦都集注在羅伯勃隆登發現的那塊荒地的四周了。</p>
<p>我們從前亦曾説過，在電影初發明的時候，戲劇界的人物是很輕視電影演員的。舞臺上的名伶，决不肯到電影公司拍影戲，而較小些的伶人，爲了要賺些外快而同意拍戲的時候，一定要偷偷摸摸，惟恐爲同輩知道了恥笑他。可是等到各地的影片公司，集中在好萊塢一個地方，在人才財力雙方發揮了電影事業的本能之後，戲劇界的人物，就不能再永遠漠視了。</p>
<p>電影明星所獲得的酬資，漸漸超過了舞台上的演員所能得的，但是曼麗璧克馥的母親，却無意之中提高了一般電影演員的身份。她首先勸告攝製家，將曼麗的薪水，突然地膨漲起來。並且將事實散佈出去，當作一種宣傳的資料。當然曼麗璧克馥母親的用意，亦不過呌她的女兒能多賺幾個錢，却不知這樣一來，電影演員賺大薪俸的風氣就開了。從此以後，一個電影明星的薪水，比一個一國元首所得的還多，其始作俑者，還是老牌影后，曼麗璧克馥哩。我們現在且談談幾個最早的電影明星的事蹟。</p>
<p>那個時候的女明星，除去了曼麗璧克馥和格羅麗亞史横横蓀等幾個人之外，梅阿麗蓀（May　Allison），亦是一位煊赫一時的女明星。她從喬幾亞來到好萊塢之後，突然地紅了起來。她是米曲羅公司諸大明星之一，但是，很奇怪的，她的服飾行動，却簡單天真得和一位鄉下姑娘一樣。</p>
<p>同時從俄國來了一位浪漫女性，那齊摩伐（NazlEovo），她的行徑和梅阿麗蓀，却正是一個相反，那齊摩伐是現代一般女明星所謂「格拉摩」（Glartc　r）的始祖。她們二人，個性完全兩樣，却同享着盛名，各人有各人擁護的觀衆。由此可見，好萊塢是個形形色色，各不相同的人才薈萃之所，到如今亦是如此也。</p>
<p>那時的那齊摩伐，氣燄之高，可以令人望而却歩。她自己選擇自己的劇本，自己製造富麗堂皇的佈景，自己作着華麗新奇的裝束。這樣，她將她的作品，加了一種不可思議的彩色和誘惑性。這是好萊塢前此所没有看到過的，而一般觀衆亦不禁爲之目貽神往了。那齊摩伐是個聰明絶頂的人，她處處顯露着不可限量的前途。大家都覺得她是爲藝術而生存，人間的痛苦是她所不會嘗到的。但是大家都猜着了。我們現在且略談一談那齊摩伐一段失戀的事蹟。</p>
<p>那齊摩伐到好萊塢的時候，是由一個却爾斯白利安（Charles　Brjant）同來的。他們同居着，人家總以爲他們是夫婦的。但是不久這個白利安却又好一個别的女子結婚了，並且他和那齊摩伐亦没有離婚。原來他和那齊摩伐並没有結過婚。大家對於這件事，都議論紛紛，不過總以爲那齊摩伐是受不了什麽影響的。這個時候，彭保羅（就是後來自殺的，琪恩哈羅的丈夫）却看出了她內心的悲痛。她那時正在紐約，她吩咐飯店裏的侍者，説她一概不見客，並且不接外來的電話。保羅想見她，亦見不到。後來他行了賄賂，將他放了上去。</p>
<p>彭保羅走進了那齊摩伐的房間，就勸她道：「噲，你不可以這樣。你不能讓人家知道你在傷心。快穿上你最美麗的晚服。我和你一同出去，讓大家看看。這樣才可以人家佩服你的膽量哩」。那齊摩伐聽了彭保羅的話，果然，換好了衣服，和他一同出去了。他們一晚走遍了紐約各大夜總會。看見他們的人，都交頭接耳，紛紛議論着。這次的事，就是電影明星私人生活得到大衆重視的第一遭，後來利用明星們的婚姻和戀愛事故，作爲擴大宣傳的資料，亦是從那齊摩伐的時候開始的。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c208">新到好萊塢的兩個歐洲女明星 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>我們聽見了許多傳聞，説倫敦怎樣將成爲世界第二影都，怎樣和好萊塢競爭，而打倒好萊塢，以及怎樣好萊塢的明星，陸續的往歐洲去，或被倫敦吸引了去。但是，在這裏，却已有兩位女明星，被好萊塢從歐洲羅致了去。她們一個是英國人，一個是德國人。</p>
<p>那個英國籍的女明星，就是那和島格拉斯，范朋克合演「美人心」（The　Private　Life　of　Don　Juan）的曼爾奥蓓朗（Merle　Oberon）。既稱爲「美人心」當中的美人，其美不言可知了。曼爾奥蓓朗確實是一位美人兒，聽説還是老范朋克經過若干次的嚴密遴選的結果哩。</p>
<p>自從「美人心」拍完了之後，「美人心」的本身，雖不只什麽十二分成功之作，但它的女主角曼爾奥蓓朗的艷名，却噪甚一時，而好萊塢的二十世紀公司，就捷足先登，將她羅致了去。</p>
<p>説曼爾奥蓓朗到了好萊塢之後，攝製家桑納克（Darryl　Zanuck）特爲她耗費了三萬五千美金的鉅資，作爲她的改裝費。其中二萬五千元係治裝費，一萬元係化妝費。這下子一來，就將一位歐洲的美人，完全改造爲好萊塢理想中的美人了。</p>
<p>那位德籍的女明星從倫敦影壇轉道而來的。她曾在「凱寨琳女皇」中做過凱寨琳女皇，所以她的大名，是早已名聞天下的了。她現在已啟程到美國去。她將先在紐約舞臺上表演若干時，然後再到好萊塢去。</p>
<p>這位明星，就是伊麗莎白貝格妮（Elisabeth　Bergner）。據説她是一個膽小如小鹿，害怕如小山羊的東西。她到了美國，自紐約到好萊塢，將避免一切新聞記者。大家或者會説，她是模倣嘉寳，但怕懼新聞記者，似乎是她的天性。他在倫敦的時候，英國的新聞記者從來没有得到過她的談話，或者無孔不入的美國記者，比英國的新聞記者要本事大些。但也許美國新聞記者的强硬態度，更使她害怕而更避得開些。</p>
<p>伊麗莎白貝格妮的惟一保護人，就是她的多才多藝的丈夫。她在英國的時候，她和她的丈夫，係如影隨形，不相分離的。她在攝影塲上，她的丈夫亦是一刻不離她的左右的。據説她的丈夫不在旁邊的時候，就會喪魂失魄，手足無所措的。</p>
<p>這樣看來，好萊塢還正在外國各地羅致人才，不見得就此衰落下去也。俗語説，百足之蟲，死而不僵，何况好萊塢還没有到死的時候，怎麽就説她僵了呢？</p>

<p>— 國城</p>
<p>没有多少年以前，用劇烈而激動的題材驚震了全紐約社會的作者埃廸霍登（Edith　Wharton）的這部文學巨著「相逢恨晚」（In　age　of　Inhocence），新近經過了電華製片廠之編劇者們的多方册改和編排，於是便這樣地搬上銀幕來了。</p>
<p>在攝成了影片的塲合裏，它是努力保存了原著固有的那種哀婉的空氣與情節，而盡力删短去許多不必要的成分，來描述一段純潔無疵的戀愛，爲了習俗而被失敗了的經過。</p>
<p>故事裏最高潮的一個節奏，是在説明那高度的道德和正義的觀念，所顯示給男女主角的力量，一直使他們不得不屈身去顧慮到那種「正當的合禮舉動的」法典上面。</p>
<p>愛琳鄧（Irene　Dnnne）和約翰鮑爾士（Jono　Boles）分飾本片的主角爲一雙Unrequiled　Lnvers，他們倆人所給與觀衆的表演的成績，不僅是以過去的經騐而保持着最動人的儀態與動作，並且這是成功於他們合演的「Back　Street」之上。</p>
<p>出現於「相恨逢晚」的主要演員，尚有嘉里霍登（Julie　Haydon）和五位紐約舞臺恊會非常享盛名的紅伶——Lionel　Atwill，Helen　Westley，Laura　Hope　Crews等。</p>

<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>忽然門外有汽車的聲音，可是她在悲切深思之中，一些不理會。門裏門外，都和她没有相干。她雖然想再鼓起勇氣來，可是在這一忽兒，她的頭已經抬不起來了。這時祇有柏資，萬分無聊的在門外呆望着。他忽然注意到那幾輛停下來的汽車。幾個暗探從前面一輛車上，跳了下來。又從一輛最大的車裏，走出一個身材高大的人，怱怱走向學校的門。柏資連忙將門開了，不知不覺地呌了一聲：「大總統」！那人略一頷首，就走了進去。那高大的人，在穿堂中徐徐走着，時時站住了撫摸着桌子，好像有所感觸似的。</p>
<p>他現在已經走進了校長室，站在密司貝爾斯的前面。他像一個小孩子似的，背着課本道：「上帝祝福於你，小小的人兒。赤着脚，帶着…」密司貝爾斯慢慢抬起頭來，淚眼模糊的亦看不淸前面站的是誰，祇像教小學生似的跟着背道：「帶着赭色的面龐兒。」她然後拭去了眼淚，望前一看，忽然歡然站了起來喊道：「你怎麽會來的？」總統靄然的説道：「我因爲倦於政治…我覺得世上還有多少東西没有學到…還有多少東西，你可以教我的」。他説着走向貝爾斯的面前，貝爾斯連忙凑上一歩，他們就抱持起來了。這時的貝爾斯，不覺涕淚縱横起來。</p>
<p>在外面，柏資已經瘋狂似的，將消息散佈了出去，全城的人，一個一個向着學校源源不絶而來。傑賴和賀倫特，亦得到了消息趕到了，但是克拉倫斯戴德比他們先來。傑賴大踏歩走向校門，一壁走，一壁奇怪道：「真的嗎？總統在這裏嗎？他爲什麽來的呢」？戴德道：「如果你一定要知道的話，是我打電報給他的」。傑賴要想走進去，却被戴德攔住了。他説：「傑賴！你給我和大家一塊兒站着！你亦不過鄉曲之輩，没有見過天下，和别人有什麽兩樣」？傑賴怒氣勃勃想將他推開，却又推他不開。</p>
<p>一回兒，門開了，大總統走了出來，密司貝爾斯扶在他的臂上。大家看見總統走出來，都静了下去。總統於是開口説道：「我的朋友……我的同鄉……我現在没有什麽話可説。我來到此地，是爲要休息和思維……以及祈禱……和致謝這位終身服務於社會，教育兒童，造成健全公民的一位好婦人」。他於是轉身向着密司貝爾斯道：「我爲我一生事業，都受之於你的，特向你致謝」。人叢中起了一片歡呼之聲。這時傑賴低聲對着賀倫特道：「你聽見了没有？我們不能置之不理。我們祇好請她回來了」！吉莉和桑狄，站在他們近處，聽見了他們講的話，大家握緊了手，相視一笑。</p>
<p>總統還抓住了密司貝爾斯的手説道：「我很榮幸的能和你握手，我的幼小時候的教師。這樣，我就代表了全國的民衆，向這些默默無聲的英雄，一再的表示感謝之忱—因爲他們愛護國家青年的熱忱，不亞於父母之愛他們自己的子女也」！人叢中又起了一陣歡呼之聲。露蘭貝爾斯這時，已經不知自身在天上或人間了。但是她却看見了克拉倫斯戴德，戴德向她微微一笑。她又看見了教育視察員賀倫特。他是趨奉上司的人，他連忙向貝爾斯笑着點頭。她的眼睛然後又回到總統身上。總統俯視着她，眼光中顯露着無限崇敬之意—一個勇往直前的戰士—能在絶處逢生，轉敗爲勝！（完）</p>

<p>Chairman Lin's Report at the National Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held its memorial week on the morning of the 4th. Those present included Yu Youren, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Yongbin, Chen Qicai, Chen Xunyong, Cao Haosen, Lin Xiang, Chu Minyi, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 500 staff members from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Kong Xiangxi was originally scheduled to give a report. However, Kong did not arrive due to fatigue from his return trip from Wuhan to Nanjing. Chairman Lin gave the report instead, entitled "Learn From the Strengths of Europe and America, Strive to Catch Up." He first stated that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings said, "If we want to restore the inherent position of the nation, in addition to restoring all national essence, we must also learn from the strengths of Europe and America," and "When we learn from foreign countries, we must strive to catch up, not follow behind them." Dr. Sun Yat-sen felt that Chinese people had two mental flaws: self-esteem and self-abasement. Both of these mentalities are weaknesses of our people and should be strongly reflected upon. Because if a country wants to survive in the world, it must have staunch and outstanding core members. These people must have the ambition to be brave and diligent, and the spirit of fearlessness, to move forward, catch up quickly, and achieve something. He then said that if our country wants to learn from foreign countries and strive to catch up, we should follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, first eliminate the above two mentalities, abandon our weaknesses, and learn from others' strengths. If we specialize in learning from others' strengths and can distinguish others' weaknesses, we need not fear not being able to catch up. Finally, he said that although our country has embarked on the path of civilized countries in the world, our strength is still far behind. Colleagues in the government bear the responsibility of building the country. Thinking of the frugality and diligence of the ancients, such as Duke Wen of Wei and King Goujian of Yue, and the courageous revitalization of Germany and Turkey in recent times, how should we catch up with Europe and America? We should follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, use political power to urge all aspects to move forward, explore the essence, conduct overall inspections, and it will be possible to catch up. We should invigorate our spirits and have this determination, etc. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] The Central Committee held its 72nd Memorial Week at 9 a.m. on the 4th. Those present included Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Hong Ludong, Li Ciwen, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Ding Chaowu, Wang Luyi, and more than 500 staff members. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting. Hong Ludong reported on his thoughts on party affairs over the past year, stating that in recent years, the number of party members has increased, their knowledge and experience have become richer, and the organization has been completed, which is a great improvement compared to the past. However, the actual performance is not yet significant. The reason is that the party governs the country, and the so-called performance of the party is to promote politics. Personally, I believe that the party should improve from the following three aspects: (1) the party's policy of using party members, (2) the consistency of the central and local systems, and (3) the full utilization of the organization, which may further consolidate the foundation of the party. The meeting adjourned after the speech. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Describes His Impressions After Arriving in Sichuan</p>
<p>[Chongqing] Chairman Chiang gave a speech to leaders from all walks of life at an enlarged memorial week held at the office of the special commissioner of provincial party affairs at 9 a.m. on the 4th. Officials above the level of section chief in civil affairs, officers above the rank of colonel in the military, and principals of schools above the middle school level were all present. After the ceremony was performed according to protocol, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech, saying, "I have been in Sichuan for three days and have seen that, with the joint efforts of all comrades, everything is in order. I am personally very gratified. Sichuan has a vast territory, abundant resources, a large population, and a high level of culture, and it contains a great power. It was not only the most important place for the revolution in the past, but it will also serve as the base for the revolution in the future. The mission entrusted to all comrades is great, and the responsibility is heavy. If we can work together in accordance with the principle of love and sincerity, we will surely be able to build Sichuan into a model province and then build a new China. However, both revolution and construction cannot be achieved overnight. We must use scientific methods and proceed step by step. Over the past 24 years, few undertakings have been successful. One reason is that we have seen things as too easy, and the other is that we have been too impatient in the past. In the future, everyone should strive to become stronger and never stop or be impatient. We will surely be able to overcome difficulties and complete our great cause. Furthermore, I have heard people say that Sichuan is the first to be in chaos before the world is in chaos, and Sichuan is the last to be governed after the world is governed. This shows that Sichuan's relationship with the country and the nation is extremely close. If Sichuan is not governed well, the whole country will be affected. Therefore, the responsibility of all comrades is particularly heavy. I hope that all comrades will work hard to build Sichuan so that the country will be well influenced and the goal of national rejuvenation will be achieved. What all comrades should strive to do urgently today is to relieve the suffering of the people and build Sichuan. In the future, there can be no more wars in Sichuan except for suppressing bandits. I am here to help Chairman Liu relieve the suffering of the people and build Sichuan. I hope that all comrades will work together with one heart and one mind. Within three years, Sichuan can also become the center of the revolution and the foundation for the restoration of the country. In addition, the New Life Movement is the new life of the revolutionary country and is related to the success or failure of the country. The revolution and construction in the past have not been completed because of the lack of important conditions in spirit, which is the lack of a new life. The essence of the new life is propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. We must express these four virtues in our daily life, such as eating, clothing, housing, and transportation. Naturally, we will become new citizens. All comrades have no shortcomings in the New Life Movement. Everyone should be determined to be a model for the people and hope to influence others from near to far. Its effect will naturally be great. From what I have felt in the three days since I came here, I feel that the police and soldiers are still lacking in implementing the New Life Movement. They are no less than teachers of the people. If their clothing is not neat and their spirit is not good, the people will imitate them, and all customs and habits will be adversely affected." (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Wu Jingheng Speaks on the Purpose of the Homespun Movement <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Implement it First Among People in Cities</p>
<p>Maintain the Livelihood of Unemployed Farmers and Workers</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Wu Jingheng gave a speech at the City Party Headquarters, saying that the homespun movement is actually a movement related to the life and death of China. The homespun movement is actually a major problem for the majority of Chinese people today, and this movement must be initiated by people who live a more comfortable life in cities in order to be effective. It is true that farmers in rural areas cannot even get the most inferior homespun to wear. The reason is that we who live in cities have lost the benefits of wearing homespun. Therefore, in order to save the rural economy, we should urgently promote the wearing of homespun so that rural people can have the opportunity to weave cloth and enjoy the benefits of wearing and selling surplus homespun. All countries in the world regard wearing domestic goods as a matter of course. Today, the propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame of the New Life Movement are being promoted. In ancient times, we wore inferior clothes and food but beautiful embroidered clothes. On the one hand, we took into account the national system, and on the other hand, we took into account the people's economy. This is the true spirit of integrity. We believe that everyday clothes can be made of homespun, while silk can be worn for social occasions. When going abroad, several sets of Western clothes can be prepared, but the raw materials should be made of homemade wool. At the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year, I and Mayor Shi and others suggested to the Central Committee to rescue the yarn factories and promote homespun. Rong Zongjing and others in the domestic yarn industry all said that if the government could implement such a proposal, the domestic textile industry could be saved. Because there are domestic textile factories, due to outdated machines and unskilled workers, they can mostly only spin coarse yarn and weave coarse cloth. Now we should not be discouraged by the fact that our capital is weak and it is difficult to compete with foreigners. When I was in Lyon, France, there were many factories with 1,000 or 3,000 iron machines, but there were also many private homes with one or two iron machines. Therefore, at this time of global depression, France is the most stable. I have always hoped that China will become a scientific and technological country in the future, not just limit the people of the country to making and wearing homespun. The scientific technology I am talking about is not to teach people to be extravagant and modern, but to be able to make aircraft and cannons ourselves, develop industry, and enrich the country and strengthen the people. Today, although we are promoting the homespun movement here, we are still afraid that the enemy will try to sabotage it. Therefore, even for a small homespun movement, we still need to have great perseverance. Since we cannot make high-quality wool, why not wear homemade homespun? It does not hurt our dignity. Even today, Japan is a first-class power in the world, but it still does not change its old habits of dragging wooden clogs and sitting on the floor. In addition, I hope that domestic goods companies can sell homespun in the future, and small shops specializing in homespun can be opened at the gates of each city to facilitate sales. The same can be done with local silk and yarn. Start with people in cities implementing the wearing of homespun. The purpose of the homespun movement is to enable unemployed farmers and workers to get the opportunity to work and maintain their livelihood. We should know that if the countryside goes bankrupt, we will feel the pain ourselves. If we do not find a way to save them, I am afraid that in the near future, we will have nothing to live on. I hope that all compatriots in the country will quickly realize this and take action. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Hong Kong] Doihara, accompanied by Japanese Consul Kawai Tatsuo, went to the municipal government to meet with Liu Jiwen at 2 p.m. on the 4th. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Doihara's visit to Guangdong this time has led many to believe that he must be lobbying the leaders of the Southwest to agree to Sino-Japanese friendship. Although he himself has not uttered a word, the Guangdong authorities have banned newspapers from publishing news about his visit to Guangdong, which has only increased speculation among all sectors at home and abroad. After arriving here yesterday by train from Hong Kong with Oyama, an advisor to the South Manchuria Railway Company, he went straight to the Japanese hotel in Shamian and refused to see guests. This morning, he began to busy himself with meeting many local Japanese businessmen, but still made no statements. Later, the municipal government held a welcome meeting, which allowed Doihara to meet with the leaders of the Southwest. It is said that they exchanged views on Sino-Japanese cooperation. Before taking a plane to Guangxi tomorrow to visit Li Bai, Doihara will also meet with Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, and others for further talks. (4th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Hu Hanmin declared today that if it is based on the principle of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's alliance with nations that treat us as equals in the world to fight together, then the leaders of southern China are not opposed to the resumption of Sino-Japanese relations. This afternoon, Hu Hanmin told an Associated Press reporter that he had met with Doihara for two hours this morning to discuss Sino-Japanese issues and had explained this to Doihara. Hu continued to say that the leaders of the South, in principle, agree to the resumption of Sino-Japanese relations, but before there is any real progress in the resumption of relations, Japan must abandon its position as any kind of protector. Hu raised the declaration made by Japan to other countries in April last year that it would not interfere in China, and said that the leaders of the South opposed this attitude. He had told Doihara that this declaration was equivalent to Japan considering itself the master of the Asian continent. It would be difficult to discuss Sino-Japanese cooperation before Japan abandoned this attitude. Cooperation between China and Japan should be based on the unanimous demands of the Chinese people. Doihara said that his visit to Guangdong had no special meaning and that Japan had not held any negotiations with the Chinese government. (11th Day National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Matters Requiring Attention When Utilizing Foreign Capital <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since the National Revolution in our country, the debts incurred by the government over the years have mostly been domestic debts. As for foreign debts, apart from the Sino-Belgian-American 6% Loan of 1928, the Cotton and Wheat Loan of 1933, and the 6% US Dollar Boxer Indemnity Loan of 1934, there are no other significant foreign debts to speak of. This is partly because the government is unwilling to incur more foreign debt, and partly because foreigners are unwilling to lend money to us. However, recently, the atmosphere has changed drastically. Following Japan's high-profile advocacy of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, there was the international loan to China movement initiated by Britain. Although both are still in the brewing stage, and it is still difficult to say whether they will succeed, this kind of phenomenon is unprecedented since the National Revolution. Although those who oppose foreign debt may regard it as a sign of imperialism intensifying its aggression against us, from the perspective of those who support the use of foreign capital, it can also be seen as an indication that our country's politics are more stable than before, and that the great powers are happy to invest. In fact, whether foreign debt is beneficial or harmful depends on whether foreign capital can be used well. This was mentioned in yesterday's commentary. Now, please allow me to elaborate further based on facts.</p>
<p>In terms of facts, our country is an import-surplus country, and capital cannot be accumulated. If we want to develop production and construction, there is no other way but to import foreign capital. Our country's international balance of payments has always been in deficit, which is supplemented by foreign investment in China. That is the reason. Therefore, the inflow of foreign capital is actually an inevitable trend in our country's import-surplus trade situation. Without it, it would be impossible to adjust our country's balance of payments with foreign countries. Understanding this means knowing that if we want the silver that flowed out of our country last year to flow back in completely, it may be necessary to issue foreign debt, according to remedial measures. Moreover, the development of material construction requires even more funds, and it is impossible without utilizing foreign capital. Therefore, the problem facing our country today is not to oppose the inflow of foreign capital, but to study how to use foreign capital. In essence, if it can be used for production, then even if we are temporarily constrained, there will eventually be a day to turn around. Otherwise, issuing foreign debt will have many drawbacks. The danger is self-evident.</p>
<p>Examining the history of foreign capital inflow into our country, it has been more than 40 years. Generally, from the Boxer Rebellion to the Xinhai Revolution, railway and telecommunications loans were the majority. Therefore, although foreigners obtained generous interest and special rights due to investment, the enterprises remained in our country, so it was still productive. However, since the Xinhai Revolution, although a large amount of foreign capital has been imported, its nature has mostly belonged to political loans, and most of it has been used for internal wars. Not only is it not productive, but it also increasingly loses its tax revenue rights in customs, salt, and other taxes. This is a major reason for the disparity in our country's international balance of payments and the financial difficulties today. There is nothing more harmful and less beneficial than this. Learning from the past, if we want to utilize foreign capital in the future, we must strictly distinguish between productive and non-productive. If it is productive, we should welcome it. If it is non-productive, then the lesson of Egypt's demise should be a warning, and we should exercise self-discipline and not try it lightly. However, given the shortage of silver reserves in our country today, a currency loan seems necessary to alleviate the exhausted market. However, we believe that this is only a temporary measure. The fundamental plan still lies in the development and conservation of our country's production industries. Only in this way, we will not issue foreign debt unless we have to. If we do issue foreign debt, it must be used for production.</p>
<p>Recent news has revealed that the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation advocated by the Japanese aims to keep us in the position of an agricultural country. Therefore, their expectation is that we will further reduce our tariff rates on Japan. We are an agricultural country, and revitalizing agriculture is a necessary plan. However, seeking the development of industry is also indispensable for a modern country. Otherwise, it will not be able to survive. Therefore, on this point, the people of our country must pay full attention and research. As for the loan movement initiated by Britain, whether it also has similar conditions is not yet known. And whether it can become a reality is still a question. However, if it does not have political conditions attached, and the funds can be used by us for production, then, based on the matter itself, there is no need to oppose it.</p>

<p>Seeking Friendship Between the Two Countries on an Equal Basis</p>
<p>Satisfactory Results from Sincere Exchange of Views</p>
<p>Reiterating that This Trip is of a Private Nature and the Government is Not Bound</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Dr. Wang Chonghui is about to leave Japan and today issued a statement saying that disputes between the two major Eastern countries in recent years have not only had a significant impact on both China and Japan, but have also adversely affected the harmony of the world. Now that I am leaving the friendly shores of Japan and happily heading to The Hague, I am convinced that a way to end this unfortunate dispute has been achieved. Wang also said that his talks in Japan were not without effect, largely due to the friendly attitude of Japanese leaders who seized the opportunity to listen sympathetically.</p>
<p>Wang especially expressed his gratitude to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, saying that Hirota had expressed his sincerity in pursuing a peaceful policy towards China based on non-aggression and non-threat. Wang also stated that his talks in Japan were completely informal and the Chinese government was not bound by them in any way. He continued, "I sincerely hope to contribute to the restoration of ordinary friendship. I have suggested that the relationship between China and Japan can only be improved by peaceful means, through diplomatic channels, and on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Mr. Hirota expressed great sympathy for my humble opinion. I also exchanged views with other Japanese politicians and key figures in the army and navy, equally sincerely and openly. I am now leaving Japan, and I am convinced that there has been a real turning point in Sino-Japanese relations, and I feel that since both sides have expressed the same goodwill, there will be concrete results and opportunities for success."</p>
<p>Wang concluded by saying that China and Japan, seeking sincere friendship based on the aforementioned principles, will surely achieve harmony and make East Asian peace stable for a long time. I dare to predict that this harmony and stability can be achieved on terms fully accepted by other countries in the world. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e19">British Government's Explanation of Financial Assistance to China <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Washington Talks Did Not Cover the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>Britain, America, and France Decide to Adopt Consultation Methods</p>
<p>[London] The British government gave the following informal explanation regarding the issue of proposing assistance to China to the United States: The content of the British ambassador's talks with the US authorities in Washington concerned the possible issue of assisting China's finances. In order to overcome economic difficulties, the Chinese government has been in consultation with the British and other governments, and the outline of a loan agreement has been established between the Shanghai Chinese banking community and foreign banking groups. However, it is doubtful whether this loan method can be established. The British government's views on this issue have been notified to the governments of Japan, the United States, and France, which are members of the Four-Power Loan Consortium. The British government believes that the implementation of international assistance to China is absolutely dependent on the participation of the Japanese government. The Washington talks did not explicitly mention the Nine-Power Treaty, but the problem of China's financial difficulties is based on consideration of the Nine-Power Treaty, which is indeed a fact. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Since Britain launched the invitation to the United States, Japan, and France to jointly discuss ways to provide economic assistance to China, Washington has first recognized the need for rapid consideration of this method. At the same time, there is also news that Britain, the United States, and France have decided to adopt a method of mutual consultation regarding the economic assistance to China.

<p>The Four-Power Banking Consortium Agreement Still Exists</p>
<p>Unwilling to Consider Hasty Without Receiving Official Information</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked by a foreign reporter today whether the Four-Power Banking Consortium Agreement of 1920 was "dead," he claimed that he believed that this agreement still existed, as he had never heard of its funeral. The agreement was concluded by Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, stipulating that no loans should be made to China alone. When foreign reporters asked about the news of international loans to China, it was claimed, "Why don't the countries consult with Japan? We have not heard of such loan news. Even the Japanese ambassadors to Britain and the United States have not reported it. Before we receive accurate information, we cannot discuss this matter." The spokesperson later talked about Sino-Japanese friendship, saying that in his opinion, this move could benefit both China and Japan. This move is not a new policy of any one of the two countries, as Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already advocated it first. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>China, a Vast Country with a Large Population, Should Occupy a Seat</p>
<p>British Proposal Submitted to the September General Assembly for Discussion</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Federation of League of Nations Associations from various countries recently met here and concluded its work today. Before the adjournment, many resolutions were passed, the most important of which was proposed by the British representative, advocating that China be granted a semi-permanent council seat in the League of Nations Council, saying that since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, Asian countries have not been adequately represented in the Administrative Council, China is a vast country with a large population, and the nature of various issues in the Far East is serious, so it is appropriate for China to occupy a semi-permanent seat in the Administrative Council. This case and other resolutions will be submitted for approval at the next General Assembly to be held in Beijing in June next year. The Federation also organized a small committee to study the international responsibility for the Marseille murder case, so as to submit a report to the next General Assembly. (Note: China was elected as a council member in 1931, and its term expired last year. According to regulations, it cannot be re-elected within three years after the expiration of the term. However, it can be re-elected if two-thirds of the League of Nations General Assembly approves, which is called a semi-permanent council member or a quasi-permanent council member.

<h3 id="e28">British Military Expenditure Soars <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Army Seeks Mechanization</p>
<p>Special Attention to Air Defense</p>
<p>Defense Policy White Paper Released</p>
<p>Parliament to Begin Debate Next Monday</p>
<p>[London] Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha today issued a statement on the estimated cost of the army budget, saying that the British government believes that the current time is the time when military preparations cannot lag behind, so this budget estimate stipulates an increase of 3.95 million pounds in army expenditure, totaling 43.5 million pounds, and an increase of 2,700 army personnel, totaling 152,200 people. Although expenditure has increased, it is still one million pounds less than in 1925. In order to make British preparations more suitable for the times, the budget estimate contains programs to be held over several years, such as the addition of military camps and the diligent training of regular and territorial forces, all of which should be given special attention. Coastal defense forces and several fortified ports have been inspected, and it is planned to renew their equipment. The defense against aircraft at various ports has recently made continuous progress, so the number of defense forces is planned to be slightly increased. The army is gradually becoming mechanized, and the cavalry will be reduced by 2,820 people. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Today, the British government released a white paper signed by Prime Minister MacDonald, stating the British government's defense policy and the reasons for increasing British combat power. This article is expected to be issued as the House of Commons will debate defense matters on March 11. The conclusion of the white paper states that the cost of naval, land, and air force armaments can no longer be delayed without adding to the danger. World events have shown us that Britain is gradually reaching the point of not having the necessary tools to defend against aggression. The white paper also stated that the disarmament conference has now stalled, and there are many shortcomings in Britain's defense forces and defenses. Germany has rearmed, and Russia, Japan, and the United States have also increased their armaments, so Britain cannot ignore this. The white paper also mentioned the navy, saying that British warships are old and need to be replenished as soon as possible. The number of naval anti-aircraft guns is now gradually increasing, because inefficient national defense not only wastes money but also leads to failure. Port defenses and the army must be renewed. The government plans to develop preparedness plans to protect civilians and important public utilities from air raids. Such plans have been implemented in many European countries.

<h3 id="e30">After Abdication, the Wise King of Siam Refuses to Talk About Politics <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Ten Conditions Rejected by Parliament</p>
<p>Reforming the Constitution, the Ambition is Contrary to the Wish</p>
<p>Cranleigh, England - After abdicating, the King of Siam, using the title of Prince Sukhothai, recently gave an interview to the press, remaining silent on political matters and showing no signs of worry or sorrow, only saying that he and his wife were very happy to live in Britain. He then told reporters in a humorous tone that reporters from various countries had previously misunderstood the Siamese court etiquette and used "Brother of the Moon" as the king's honorific title, and they should not do so in the future.</p>
<p>Ten Conditions</p>
<p>According to reports, there are ten conditions for the King of Siam to be reinstated, as follows: (1) Half of the members of parliament are not elected by the people. According to the constitution, the government appoints them. In the future, they should be jointly selected by civil servants and the government. (2) Naval and army officers should not attend parliament or interfere in politics in the future. (3) Regarding the king's veto power, previously only a majority decision of parliament was required to override it. In the future, it should be decided by a three-quarters majority of parliament or by a popular vote. (4) The people should have the freedom of assembly and association and to publish opinions or give speeches and propaganda in newspapers. (5) Constitutional guarantees should be included in the criminal law, and all political lawsuits should be tried by ordinary courts. (6) All political prisoners should be granted amnesty. (7) All civil servants who have been dismissed due to political relations should be reinstated. (8) Crimes against the constitution should not be investigated. (9) Troops should be stationed at the Royal Palace permanently. (10) No death sentence should be carried out before the king has decided whether to grant a pardon. The above conditions were rejected by the Siamese Parliament, so the king decided to abdicate. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Concern for the People's Suffering</p>
<p>[London] As a result of his abdication, the King of Siam will henceforth be known as Prince Sakdaya. In his abdication edict, the King of Siam criticized the tyrannical behavior of the Siamese government. The King of Siam said that he was willing to give his privileges to the people, but he was unwilling to give them to any individual or political party, as the purpose of these people was nothing more than to abuse their privileges for personal gain. Finally, the King of Siam said, "I am now unable to serve my motherland and my people any longer. I am deeply sorry, but I only hope that the Siamese people can be happy." (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Young Nephew Succeeds</p>
<p>Noel Park, England - The secretary of the King of Siam announced today that the King of Siam has formally abdicated. The abdication edict was signed at 1:45 p.m. on Saturday and immediately sent to the Siamese Embassy in London. The secretary also said that the King of Siam's eleven-year-old nephew, Prince Ananda, may inherit the throne. As for the reasons for the King of Siam's abdication, the secretary said that it was because the Siamese cabinet led by Colonel Bahol had completely rejected the King of Siam's demands for government reform. Now the King of Siam will temporarily reside in London until after June, and then the plans have not been decided, and will depend entirely on the environment. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Pessimistic About the Political Situation</p>
<p>[London] The Times stated in an editorial today that the Siamese political situation is very unstable and the country's future is very uncertain. This situation is becoming increasingly clear due to three factors: (1) the explanation of the King of Siam's abdication, (2) the points of contention between the King of Siam and the Siamese government, and the government's maintenance of the 1933 legislation to deal with the military revolution. Left-wing politicians hope to cross the gap between hereditary aristocracy and constitutional monarchy in one fell swoop, but their actions have now failed. Their sudden mobilization has led to the future responsibility of Congress, the government, and the royal family, and it is feared that their future will be detrimental to both the government and the royal family.

<h3 id="e31">The Pound Falls, the United States Considers Countermeasures <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Likely to Use Funds for Relief</p>
<p>The International Currency War Intensifies</p>
<p>[Washington] Today's news is that government officials are paying close attention to the soaring gold prices in London, which are setting new records every day. At the same time, they are also paying attention to the falling pound, which has reached its lowest price in the New York exchange market since October 1933. They are completely silent on the current international monetary situation, but it is generally believed that they are already discussing plans to deal with the falling pound, as the falling pound may have a deflationary impact on US prices, which would conflict with President Roosevelt's plan. Now the pound has fallen to an extent that exceeds the fall of the dollar, so that the dollar is at its highest level in years compared to the pound. The Treasury Department is still not surprised on the surface, but claims that the government has not yet used the $200 million stabilization fund and can provide relief when necessary. They are unwilling to criticize the saying that the United States will further reduce the value of the dollar to offset the benefits of the falling pound. According to news from Paris, the French authorities believe that the current situation in London is very dangerous, and they are very afraid that after the pound falls further, the British stabilization fund will not be able to stop it. If so, the European gold countries will have no choice but to devalue their currencies. As for Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, he does not yet believe that the situation is so serious that it is necessary to use the stabilization fund. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In the international exchange market, the pound has continued to fall for days, and on the morning of the 4th, it broke through the 28-yen barrier and fell to 27.87 yen. According to the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, Fukai, there are various theories about the reasons for the fall in the British pound, but the instability of the political situation in Britain is the primary reason. In addition, the British current year's international balance of payments showed that expenditures exceeded 1 million pounds. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated in Parliament that Britain has no intention of stabilizing the exchange rate by agreement. For these reasons, short-term foreign capital entering Britain from foreign countries has continued to flow out of the country. If Britain uses a huge amount of funds for this, the pound may fall even further. (4th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] A Wall Street financial authority stated today that the decline in the pound may be a turning point in global currency stability. His theory is that if the fall in the pound forces France to abandon the gold standard, then the United States and Britain will quickly seek ways to prevent the franc from falling too much. A sharp fall in the franc will trigger a global currency war, and as a result, all countries involved will be harmed. Therefore, all countries will try their best to avoid this. The authority continued, "If France and other gold standard countries are forced to abandon the gold standard, then other countries will be forced to agree to stabilize the franc. This is truly a turning point for recovery." (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Franc Devaluation Possible</p>
<p>[Paris] The French financial community believes that it is possible for the French franc to reduce its gold value. According to reliable sources, the technical division of the French Ministry of Finance was recently ordered to study in detail the position of the Bank of France, the national financial system, and the national debt management methods after various degrees of currency devaluation. It is reported that the technical division has completed the study of various situations under the degrees of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% devaluation, so the authorities can now understand the general situation after suddenly reducing the gold value of the franc.

<p>Uncertain News of Fierce Battles in Eastern Macedonia</p>
<p>Athens - The Greek situation has reached a critical state. According to recent reports, the entire island of Crete has fallen into the hands of the rebels. The island's governor, Aposkitis, has been imprisoned by the rebels. Radio stations and important public buildings have been seized by the rebels. The leader of the rebels in Crete is Major Sanagas, and a son of former President Kondylis is also a prominent leader among the rebels. Former Prime Minister and leader of the opposition, Venizelos, is celebrating his 71st birthday today. However, he has been declared a criminal and wanted by the government, so the rebels immediately declared their support for him. Furthermore, the rebellious navy has arrived on the north coast of Crete. Although the naval headquarters had instructed the garrisoned troops there to bombard them in advance, the rebel ships passed through safely. This proves that the garrisoned troops there are sympathetic to the rebels, and therefore the government's position has become increasingly precarious. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to news received by "Le Journal" from its correspondent in Greece, former Prime Minister Venizelos has formed a three-person executive government on Crete to rule the island. When the rebel fleet, led by Admiral Temistoklis, arrived on the island, the local defense forces offered no resistance. The ships were safely moored, and the local defense forces immediately acted in concert with them, arresting the governor and then announcing their obedience to Venizelos's orders. The rebels are expected to gather the local defense forces, board warships, and sail to Athens for a last-ditch effort. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Athens - The rebellion against the government has now spread to Macedonia. Today, the government received news that the rebels in Eastern Macedonia have retreated before the government forces. Officials have also announced that they are mobilizing troops to send to Macedonia, which shows that a rebellion has broken out there. Two destroyers held by the rebels were bombarded by government aircraft last night when they passed the island of Kythira, but the result is unknown. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Using the Air Force to Survey and Suppress the Rebellion</p>
<p>Athens - The Greek government has refused to accept any compromise with the rebels and is striving to conquer the revolution. Government troops in the Drama area have defeated the rebels and then advanced to occupy the town of Kavala, so all of Macedonia and western Serres are now under government control. Yesterday, the government and rebels clashed in eastern Crete, and they are still fighting each other. The result is still unclear. Although Crete is the hometown of Venizelos, who has served as the Greek Prime Minister eight times and supports this revolution, it is reported that many civilians there have also joined the government to fight the rebels. Yesterday, the cabinet held a special meeting and decided to refuse any compromise with the rebels. The cabinet has obtained the President's approval and ordered Army Chief General Kondylis, together with Generals Mantaitzis and Dousmanis, to take any military measures and fully deal with this rebellion. Kondylis immediately led the troops in Macedonia and northern Greece and began attacking this morning, resulting in the occupation of Drama and Kavala. Since Kondylis had to go north to command, the affairs of the Ministry of the Army were temporarily taken over by General Mantaitzis. The government made considerable use of aircraft in this campaign. All civilian aircraft were requisitioned by the government yesterday for deployment. Some aircraft continued to bomb the Avroloff cruiser and the rebel ships in Suda Bay yesterday afternoon. At the same time, Venizelos's residence in Chania was bombed by the air force, causing many casualties. The rebel ships also fired artillery at the aircraft in return, but it is reported that there were no casualties on the government side. Venizelos's Liberal Party split yesterday, and the majority faction sent a telegram to Venizelos, saying that the revolutionary action was doomed to failure and would be irreversible if it did not stop immediately.

<p>Air Force Bombards Rebel Ships</p>
<p>Athens - The five ships occupied by the rebels attempted to bombard the capital this morning, but were attacked by government aircraft with bombs. The five ships dared not do so. The five ships are currently moored in Suda Bay, Crete, from which Venizelos's residence can be seen. Government aircraft were only ordered to drop bombs around the ships to avoid damaging them. One theory is that during the aircraft attack, one of the ships suddenly emitted thick smoke, which must have been caused by a direct hit causing serious damage. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>It is now known that when government artillery units bombarded Perama yesterday morning, they severely damaged the destroyers Niki and Leon, as well as a submarine.

He will never accept a position to work with Venizelos. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Former Greek dictator General Plastiras, who is now in Cannes, southern France, gave an interview to a reporter from "Paris-Soir," saying, "I have a very close friendship with former Prime Minister Venizelos. I love Venizelos very much, but he is a politician and I am a soldier, so our political views are different." He also said that if he (Plastiras) were to go to Greece now, he would be assassinated. If someone asked him to return to the country, he would ask many questions to be sure that returning to the country would be beneficial and that he would be able to stabilize the situation without causing internal strife after he took office. However, if the majority of the people wanted him to take office, he would have no choice but to do so. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>

On the 2nd, a written notice was sent to the Java-Chai-I-La Shipping Company, requesting the dissolution of the alliance upon mutual agreement, and requesting a reply by noon on the 3rd. Since there was still no reply at noon, it means that the Java-Chai-I-La side has rejected the proposal to dissolve the alliance in silence. Therefore, the four Japanese shipping companies issued a notice of withdrawal from the alliance on the 4th. Since the alliance is effectively dissolved, Japan has been placed in a free position, so the competition for cargo between the two sides will be even more intense. (Dentsu Telegram, 4th)</p>

Although the parliament has not been in session, the political struggle has been going on for a long time in private conversations, public gatherings, and newspaper commentaries. At this point, the result is the resignation of the cabinet. The current session of parliament is scheduled to open tomorrow. At that time, the current cabinet will not be able to attend, because the cabinet members have different opinions on how to find a parliamentary majority to support the implementation of reform policies. One faction advocates seeking the support of the National Unity Party, the faction of former Prime Minister András, while another faction advocates that the government should be supported by the Independent Smallholders' Party led by Eckhardt. Minister of Agriculture Dr. Károlyi, a friend of Bethlen, resigned in May, and Minister of the Interior Fischer also threatened to resign. In addition, the new party recently organized by the reformers plans to support Eckhardt's political program and oppose the Gömbös cabinet, thus forcing the government to ban demonstrations and public gatherings, which is the recent cause of the outbreak of the political tide.

<p>Mongolian and Suiyuan Representatives Will Return to Report Separately</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Mongolian taxation issue is being actively mediated by the relevant parties in Beiping, Suiyuan, and Bailingmiao. Since the issue was essentially a misunderstanding between the two sides, the Mongolian Political Council's attitude immediately turned to one of reconciliation once it was explained. The Suiyuan Provincial Government also expressed its willingness to compromise. According to a telegram from Prince De to his representative Bao Yueqing, the resolution principle was discussed and decided with Xiao Renyuan and Chen Qin in Bailingmiao: (1) Wang Jingguo's troops stationed in Mongolian territory and the tax checkpoints they set up will be completely removed. (2) The boundaries of local taxes in Mongolia and Suiyuan should be clarified. (3) In the future, camels transporting goods through Mongolian territory will pay a transit tax of eight cents per head. After Xiao and Chen discussed and obtained the principles, they returned to Suiyuan at the end of last month to report to Fu Zuoyi. Fu considered it satisfactory, but the specific measures for implementation need to be agreed upon urgently. Therefore, Xiao and Chen left Suiyuan again yesterday (1st) for Bailingmiao to continue negotiations. According to relevant parties in Beiping, the specific measures for implementation are nothing more than Wang Jingguo's troops immediately withdrawing from the Mongolian region, and the Mongolian Political Council collecting local taxes in accordance with the principles of Mongolian autonomy for construction purposes. The collection of this transit tax does not constitute an excessive action within the scope of Mongolian autonomy, but the Mongolian Political Council will submit it to the Central Government for record before implementing the tax. Bao Yueqing, Prince De's representative in Beiping, visited He Yingqin at Jurentang at 11:00 AM this morning (2nd) and is scheduled to return to Bailingmiao to report on the mandate after tomorrow (3rd) (4th). Shi Huayan, the representative of the Suiyuan Provincial Government who stayed in Beiping to negotiate, will also return to Suiyuan in the coming days. (2nd)</p>

<p>Difficulties and Disturbances Caused by Refugees Passing Through Qingpu</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Refugee Reception Center established by the Songjiang Red Cross branch has taken in more than 3,000 refugees, both men and women, old and young, from Zhejiang Province. Suddenly, on the morning of the 4th, more than 200 refugees formed a team and entered the city. They went to the Daoxiangcun teashop east of the Public Security Bureau and grabbed anything they could eat. For a time, the goods displayed on the counter were emptied. Liang Jinrong, a resident of Wangdian, was arrested by the store. According to his confession, he came from Qingpu, and the reception center here could not accommodate them, so they entered the city to ask the Public Security Bureau for relief. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to suppress the remaining refugees and escorted them out of the hospital.</p>

<p>At around 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, seven robbers dressed in tattered uniforms and armed with weapons suddenly broke into the You Yangyu Inn at No. 40 Wenjia'an, Lindun Road. The owner of the inn is You Pinzhi. They first drove the five or six men and women of the family into the inner room and tied them up together. Then they proceeded to search and plunder. After about two hours, they searched and fled. After the robbers left, the family checked and found that they had been robbed of about a thousand gold worth of cash, jewelry, and clothing. They immediately reported to the police district and urged them to strictly arrest the robbers. After receiving the report, Zhang Hanwei, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, personally went to investigate and dispatched a large number of detectives to hunt down the robbers overnight. At that time, in order to facilitate the capture of the robbers, the city gate was closed for a time and then reopened. Suspicious pedestrians were checked.

<h3 id="e99">Director Wu of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Reports on the Causes and Consequences of Public Panic in the City <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning at the Municipal Government's Expanded Memorial Week</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Government held an expanded memorial week yesterday morning, led by Mayor Wu, who presided over the ceremony. Director Wu Xingya of the Social Affairs Bureau gave a speech, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Starting with the Shenxin No. 7 Factory Incident</p>
<p>Since then, the Shanghai market has been sluggish, and all industries have been declining. Although the closing accounts for the 23rd year were barely completed peacefully amidst the successive bank and money exchange closures and store bankruptcies, the difficulties and precarious situation of the industrial and commercial sectors remain very serious. At this time, the industrial and commercial sectors were requesting the central and local governments and the financial community to provide loans to rescue the market. Suddenly, the Shenxin No. 7 Factory was auctioned off by its first creditor, HSBC, because its overdue loan could not be repaid. Since the textile industry is a newly emerging national industry in our country, and Shenxin is a giant in this industry, the auctioned No. 7 Factory has more than 56,000 spindles, more than 7,100 thread spindles, and more than 2,300 workers who depend on it for their livelihoods. The occurrence of this incident caused the industry to feel like "a rabbit dies, and a fox grieves," and the general public ran around calling for help. The already uneasy market was further burdened with a greater sense of unease. Although this matter has now been alleviated, the hearts of the industrial and commercial sectors are still filled with anxiety, as if a great disaster is imminent, forming a tragic scene of "the mountain rain is about to come, and the wind fills the building."</p>
<p>Analysis Report on Causes and Consequences</p>
<p>If we carefully consider this uneasy phenomenon in the industrial and commercial sectors from the perspective of this city, the entire country, and the world, we will feel that the current situation is indeed very serious. The recent bankruptcies of a few banks and stores, and the auction of a yarn factory, are only the beginning of this serious situation. If this continues without measures to eliminate it, it will inevitably lead to a total collapse of the entire industry. This is not only a crisis for Shanghai, but also a critical juncture for the survival of the entire nation. Today, I take this opportunity to give you an analysis report on the causes of this serious situation and its possible consequences. Speaking of the causes of this serious situation, some are long-standing, some are recent, some are external, and some are internal. These distant causes, recent causes, external causes, and internal causes are all intertwined and complex, making it difficult to explain them independently.</p>
<p>External Causes: Global Economic Panic</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the external causes. If we go back further, we can explain the impact of all the unequal treaties established after the Opium War and the Treaty of Nanjing on industry and commerce. However, due to the length of the discussion, I will not discuss it here. Now, I will only talk about the recent ones, which must mention the outbreak of the global economic panic in 1929. Since that year, the panic has become increasingly acute. In particular, to mention a few things that are closely related to us, there is the successive abandonment of the gold standard by Britain and Japan in 1931, the abandonment of the gold standard by the United States in 1933, and the vigorous implementation of the silver policy by the United States in 1934. At the same time, the tariff barriers of various countries have become increasingly strict. The so-called "locked country economy" (the economic group of nationalism (Bloc economy) including controlled trade, managed currency, etc., are all universally popular, and there are very concrete and precise methods to implement these policies. China, which has an open door and is backward in everything, is not qualified to join their economic groups, and it seems that there is no way to discuss controlled trade quota allocation with them. Under this situation, the fact that is manifested is that our country's exported goods are either actually prohibited from being imported because they cannot bear the burden of foreign tariffs, or they are everywhere because the purchasing power of foreign markets is low, or foreigners love to use domestic products, or they are replaced by similar goods from other countries. Except for those who have no choice but to purchase our goods, I am afraid that they will not easily absorb other people's money. Looking back at the situation of foreign goods coming to China, what is the situation? Of course, foreign goods are selling well in China, and of course they have their favorable support. For example, as mentioned earlier, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have all stopped the gold standard, and the value of their currencies has decreased. At the same time, the exchange rate of our country's currency has naturally fallen. This is why we have cheap foreign goods to enjoy, and their governments also use all kinds of methods, such as exempting export taxes and giving preferential rewards, to help goods be dumped in China. Moreover, within China, there are foreign factories that use our abundant raw materials and labor, plus their strong capital and spiritual technology, so why worry that their products have no market? Therefore, the source of our livelihood for clothing, food, housing, and transportation is already relying on foreign goods. Other unnecessary luxury goods, cosmetics, and even daily necessities that can be replaced by domestic goods are also purchased with foreign goods. Just speaking of the six years from 1929 to the present, the trade deficit in our purchase of foreign goods was the largest in the year before last, reaching 900 million yuan, and the smallest last year was also more than 500 million yuan. Calculating an average of 600 million yuan, the total is 3.6 billion yuan. So much money has flowed out in six years. Everyone, close your eyes and think about it. What a dangerous image this is.</p>
<p>Huge Trade Deficit: The Situation is Serious</p>
<p>This huge trade deficit did not begin in recent years, but it was not considered so serious before, because although trade had a deficit before, it did not require cash to compensate. There was still a cash surplus every year, because there was a large amount of invisible income, such as remittances from overseas Chinese and foreign investment in our country, etc. In recent years, the situation has changed greatly. The careers of overseas Chinese are declining everywhere, and batches of unemployed people are returning to the country, increasing domestic unrest. Foreign investment has of course decreased sharply. Therefore, the current trade deficit must be paid with cash shipments. In addition, after the United States implemented its silver policy last year, overseas silver prices soared. General foreign merchants, banks, and unscrupulous Chinese people are shipping cash overseas for profit. In total, the net outflow of silver last year reached more than 248 million yuan. During this period, although the financial authorities announced on October 15 last year that they would increase the silver export tax and balance tax, and set up a foreign exchange stabilization committee, there was still an outflow of more than 11 million yuan of silver in November and December. According to a survey at the end of December last year, the total silver reserves of Chinese and foreign banks in this city were only more than 33 million yuan. If the outflow continues like that, it will not take long to be emptied.</p>
<p>Internal Causes: The Impact of Rural Bankruptcy</p>
<p>The above are all external causes. Now let's talk about the internal causes. First of all, we must talk about rural bankruptcy. Regarding this matter, there have been many records in recent newspapers and magazines. Many of you present here come from the countryside. Everyone already knows the truth about rural bankruptcy recently, so there is no need to elaborate. I will only point out how rural bankruptcy affects urban decline. Originally, agriculture, industry, and commerce are mutually dependent and cannot thrive independently. Even a large industrial country like the United States can cause economic panic due to agricultural decline. What's more, we are a country based on agriculture. In the past, rural silkworm cocoons, rice, wheat, and cotton were brought to Shanghai to exchange for money and buy industrial products back. Now the silk industry has been completely defeated. Rice, wheat, and cotton are also mostly purchased with foreign goods, amounting to more than 200 million yuan a year. Even the farmers themselves are eating foreign rice. May I ask how many customers are left for urban industrial products? In addition, continuous natural and man-made disasters, such as the national flood in 1931, and the locusts, droughts, and bandits in various places in various years, and the unprecedented national disasters of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, have eroded an unknown amount of vitality. The losses are difficult to calculate in numbers. These natural and man-made disasters have accelerated the promotion of rural bankruptcy, and have made many inland cities with agriculture as their background increasingly empty, gradually concentrating all their wealth in the cities to seek security, thus forming the phenomenon of urban congestion and inland anemia.</p>
<p>The Consequences in the Future are Unthinkable</p>
<p>Above, I have said a lot about the causes and current situation of the panic in Shanghai. Now let's talk about the future outcome. However, no one can predict what form the future will eventually change into. If we infer from the current situation, there are several points that can be said about the results: 1. Foreign economic self-defense measures will definitely become more sophisticated day by day, and it will be even more difficult for our goods to find a way out abroad. 2. Foreign goods will continue to come in, and the price may decrease, and the price will be lower in order to seek small profits but quick turnover, because the purchasing power of the Chinese people will reach the point where the oil is dry and the lamp wick is exhausted. This trend has been obvious last year. 3. Cash will continue to flow out non-stop, because the United States' silver purchase policy has a consistent direction. Since the Golden Bar Document was adjudicated, currency inflation has become more and more powerful, and silver will be purchased in large quantities according to the planned steps in the future, and its price will inevitably be raised further. 4. Currency contraction, price decline, rural bankruptcy, urban decline, foreign goods import, and domestic product stagnation are all mutually causal and increasingly profound in a cycle. A total collapse of industry is not impossible. 5. A recent survey shows that the number of unemployed people in this city has doubled compared to a year ago, but there is no doubt that the number of unemployed people will continue to increase in the future. Social unrest is a serious problem. I still remember more than ten years ago, when Sun Yat-sen spoke of nationalism, he mentioned the outflow of money and loudly warned us, "If the Chinese people do not wake up again, if this continues, even if foreign politicians are sleeping every day, the country will perish in less than ten years." The current situation is just as Sun Yat-sen showed us ten years later, and today foreign political and economic aggression are proceeding in tandem.</p>
<p>Adversity Strengthens the Nation: Strive Without Slackening</p>
<p>Everyone, what I have said today is all based on facts and is not alarmist. As the saying goes, "Adversity strengthens the nation." We should take advantage of this time of crisis to follow President Chiang Kai-shek's instructions to work hard, work quickly, and work practically, and strive without slackening. I believe that there is great hope for the revival of the nation. Now President Chiang Kai-shek, President Wang, Minister Kong, former Minister Song, Minister Chen, and Mayor Wu have ways to save the current national economic crisis. I hope that the industrial and commercial sectors and the financial community will think about the overall situation and maintain the status quo with the spirit of past cooperation, and help the government to overcome the difficulties together. We must know that only by working together with one heart can we coexist and prosper. As for us, we should be hardworking and enduring, frugal, and wear domestic products uniformly, and implement a new life, and use our personal intelligence and talents to the best of our ability to work for saving the country and survival. We must not be discouraged by the current situation, and we must not abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial, and abandon the right path and not go out. We believe that our country has such a large land and so many people, as long as we are of one heart and one mind, and are good at using it, no matter how excellent foreign political and economic constructions are, we will naturally be able to catch up.</p>

<p>The Second Creditor Agrees with the Government's Intentions</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Shenxin Textile Company's No. 7 Factory was arbitrarily valued and auctioned off by the British HSBC Bank, it has aroused widespread resentment in our society. Yesterday morning, the China Industrial Relief Association, the Shanghai Patriotic Goods Promotion Association, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, the China Industrial Federation, the National Goods Factory Federation, the Machine-made National Goods Factory Federation, the Industrial and Commercial Management Association, and more than 160 trade associations such as flour and miscellaneous grains jointly sent a letter to the Banking and Financial Industry Associations, requesting them to properly raise funds to maintain it. A Central News Agency reporter visited all parties concerned yesterday and said that since HSBC has expressed that there is a possibility of reversing the situation, the final solution still needs to wait for Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to come to Shanghai before there is a solution. Rong Zongjing, General Manager of Shenxin Textile Company, said that he does not intend to speak out too much in the future to avoid causing additional problems. On the second creditor side, a spokesman for the Bank of China said that future progress should be based on the government's intentions. If the government can redeem the No. 7 factory with its strength (obtain the status of the first creditor) and can share the debts of the second creditor, it is especially agreeable. According to another rumor, if the No. 7 factory can be redeemed by the government's power, it may be handed over to the Cotton Industry Control Association for handling. Since the establishment of the association, although many plans have been proposed, they have not been implemented. Now there is this opportunity, it should be able to show its effectiveness and serve as a model for Chinese yarn factories. However, this statement remains to be verified.</p>

<p>The Cooperation Method is the Other Party's Expectation</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday. Reporters asked Sun about the rumors that our government authorities intend to send a senior official to Japan for a visit in the near future. Sun was visited at his private residence on Columbia Road yesterday morning and granted an interview. In response to the above statement, Sun said that the rumors outside were not accurate, and he had not heard that the government would send him to Japan. This may be due to the other party's unilateral propaganda. He will return to Nanjing tomorrow night after he has completed his affairs in Shanghai.</p>

This time, he has come to Shanghai to take on the position of Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. We deeply believe that Director Cai will definitely be able to fulfill his duties for the public security of this city with his past spirit of hard work and service. Therefore, the colleagues of this government deeply believe that we will definitely be able to get very good help in the future. The people can also firmly believe that Director Cai will have perfect achievements for the public security of this city in the future. In short, we hope that Director Cai will abide by national laws and regulations and obey the orders of superiors in the future in order to fulfill his responsibilities."</p>
<p>Director Cai's Speech</p>
<p>Director Cai then replied, "Jinjun was ordered to take over as Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on the 1st of this month. Today, at the Municipal Government's expanded memorial week, I am holding a supplementary swearing-in ceremony. I am honored that Mayor Wu has personally supervised the oath and given earnest instructions on the future direction of work. There is something to follow in future work. Although Jinjun has served in senior military agencies for many years in the past, he does not have a deep experience in police administration. This time, I have been ordered to take on the heavy responsibility of Shanghai's public security. In the future, I can only try my best to follow the central government's intentions, follow the Mayor's instructions, and work hard and earnestly in order to live up to the government's entrustment. President Chiang Kai-shek once instructed on the day the Wuchang Camp was established that banning drugs and promoting the New Life Movement are the most important plans for saving the country at present. Based on this principle, Jinjun believes that the most important thing to pay attention to in handling the public security of this city at present is, in the negative aspect, to maintain public order, and banning drugs is also an important matter; in the positive aspect, to strictly implement the New Life Movement and change social customs. Moreover, Shanghai is an international commercial port, which is related to the reputation of the country. If public order cannot be maintained, the people will not be able to live and work in peace. Not only will industrial and commercial undertakings be unable to prosper, but education and culture will also be unable to develop. If the bad social customs are not changed, the foundation for national revival cannot be established, and all construction preparations will not help the country's danger. Therefore, during Jinjun's swearing-in ceremony, in addition to personally swearing to be loyal and serve the country, I also hope that the Mayor will supervise me from time to time, and social leaders and colleagues of this government will assist me at any time so that I can complete this arduous task in order to achieve the government's expectation of prosperity in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Original Text of the Oath</p>
<p>I solemnly swear that I will恪遵 Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, obey the party's meaning, abide by laws, and devote my loyalty and efforts to my duties. I am determined not to waste a single penny, use a single person improperly, and I am determined not to engage in private gain, bribery, or accept bribes. If I violate my oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This oath is made by Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, March 4, 1935.</p>

<p>Historical Research on the Meaning of Renaming</p>
<p>The Persian Empire will be officially renamed the Iranian Empire from March 21, 1935, because March 21 is the Iranian New Year. The Persian Consulate in Shanghai announced the reasons for changing the country's name to Iran yesterday, claiming that Persia's original name was Iran, which originated from the Aryan race, which first lived on the Iranian plateau. According to the research of the Greek historian Herodotus, Iran once had a province of Bass, and in the province of Bass, there was a city of Cyrus, named Persepolis, and Persia gradually became used by the whole country and government, and the name Iran was forgotten, and finally the country was named Persia until today. The government has now decided to officially restore the country's name to Iran.</p>

The telegram to President Chiang in Chongqing and President Wang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing stated: "In recent years, our country's national economy has been declining day by day. First, the invasion of natural and man-made disasters has led to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and the people's purchasing power has become weak as a result. Second, various countries have reduced their currency values and intensified their dumping in our country, which has led to the increasingly precarious situation of industry and commerce (omitted). People are panicked and cannot live in peace. Industry and commerce are seeking self-rescue with their own strength, and the China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association was established on March 2 in Shanghai. In addition to separately inviting Shanghai leaders and economic experts to formulate countermeasures and separately telegraphing to Your Majesty, we specially telegraphed to Your Majesty."</p>

<p>Chen Ding Sets Sail Today</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Chen Chunpu, Standing Committee Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and Director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department, Liang Yuhao, Counselor of the Department, and Zheng Lin, Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, who were sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Southeast Asia to inspect consulates and investigate commercial and overseas Chinese affairs, will depart from Shanghai by the French postal ship Adras II on the 9th, except for Zheng, and Liang has not yet scheduled a date. Chen will depart for Hong Kong by the British Company's Chetlar ship today and wait for Zheng to travel with him from Hong Kong on the 12th. Chen expressed the following opinions on Sino-Southeast Asian trade at the manufacturer's banquet the night before last:</p>
<p>To promote trade, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' dispatch of personnel to inspect the affairs of the consulate and to investigate commerce mainly means to guide the consulate to promote commercial work so that consuls can become true commercial officials in order to promote Sino-Southeast Asian trade and promote national goods. In recent years, the progress of national goods has been a significant fact. Overseas Chinese have always served as intermediary merchants and have patriotic ideas, so they are naturally happy to take on the task of promoting national goods. It is hoped that national goods manufacturers will concentrate their efforts and have a unified organization in terms of economic transportation and export, which will naturally have good results in promotion. It is hoped that the first step will be to achieve cooperation between overseas Chinese merchants and domestic manufacturers, and the second step will be to achieve cooperation between overseas Chinese capital and domestic capital, so as not to live up to the government's efforts to develop Sino-Southeast Asian trade. Please give more advice to various manufacturers, etc.</p>
<p>Visiting the factory, Chen went to the Kangyuan Can Factory on Huade Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday for a visit. Xiang Kangyuan, the manager of the factory, warmly entertained him and led him to visit various departments for a week. Chen and others greatly praised the factory's equipment and products, and did not return to their residence until 5:00 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Four Provinces Farmers Bank's Shanghai Branch Decides to Issue Subsidiary Currency Notes <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>One-Dime and Two-Dime Denominations to be Issued Soon</p>
<p>Shanghai Funding of $250,000 No Longer a Problem</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, the Shanghai branch of the Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Four Provinces Farmers Bank has seen considerable business growth since its opening. In order to facilitate financial circulation, it plans to issue one-dime and two-dime subsidiary currency notes along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line. The $250,000 in funding for the bank, previously ordered by Chairman Chiang to be raised by the Shanghai Municipal Government, is no longer a problem. A reporter from the New News Agency yesterday inquired about the situation at the bank and reports the details as follows:</p>
<p>Change of Bank Name</p>
<p>The capital of the Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Four Provinces Farmers Bank is $10 million, with $2.75 million already paid up. Its purpose is to provide funding to farmers, revitalize the rural economy, promote agricultural production, and advocate rural cooperation. Therefore, its business differs somewhat from that of ordinary banks, as its focus is entirely on the farmers. The head office is located in Hankou, with branches established in Hankou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Huangchuan, Yichang, Shashi, Laohekou, Anqing, Wuhu, Liu'an, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Fuzhou, Hukou, Xi'an, Fuzhou Xiahang Street, Fuzhou City, Xiamen, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other locations. The bank's business is currently developing rapidly, and it plans to establish branches outside the four provinces. However, the existing name of "Four Provinces" is no longer applicable, so it plans to change its name to the China Farmers Bank, which should be realized soon.</p>
<p>Issuance of Subsidiary Currency Notes</p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the bank to the New News Agency reporter, in addition to the one-dollar, five-dollar, and ten-dollar banknotes already issued in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, one-dime and two-dime subsidiary currency notes have also been issued in Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. The Shanghai branch has now decided to issue one-dime and two-dime subsidiary currency notes along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line in order to facilitate financial circulation. These subsidiary currency notes have already been printed and will be issued on a fixed date as soon as they are shipped from the head office. In the future, one-dollar, five-dollar, and ten-dollar banknotes will be issued as needed.</p>
<p>Fundraising</p>
<p>The bank's total capital is $10 million, with $2.75 million already paid up. Chairman Chiang, believing that the bank's purpose is entirely to promote the farmers' economy, previously ordered the provincial and municipal governments to raise $250,000 in funding. The Shanghai Municipal Government also received this order.</p>

<p>Negotiating the Resumption of the Shanghai-Xinjiang Air Route</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai-Xinjiang air route of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation has been repeatedly postponed due to the unrest and instability in Xinjiang Province, and has not been able to open. Yesterday, according to Li Jingcong, general manager of the company, to the Central News Agency reporter, Gao Xibing, the newly appointed Director of the Construction Department of Xinjiang Province, has come to the east to find a concrete solution for the resumption of the air route. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Xinjiang Representative Negotiating Resumption of Flights</p>
<p>According to Li, the Northwest air route of the Eurasia Company is a shortcut to connect Europe and Asia. Unfortunately, the civil war in the province has interrupted the plan for joint flights for years. Sheng Shicai previously telegraphed Executive Yuan President Wang, stating that the area was now peaceful and requesting that personnel be sent to make arrangements. The company authorities approved his request and are preparing to send personnel there this month. Now that Director Gao of the Construction Department of the province has also come east, after detailed consultations with him, they can begin to resume flights.</p>
<p>South Asia Route Not Needed</p>
<p>It does not seem necessary to open a South Asia air route, and the expenses and various procedures are quite inconvenient. The most important thing for connecting European and Asian aviation is the convenience of mail. Today, mail to Europe can be forwarded via Siberia, which only takes twelve days to reach Europe. Opening a South Asia air route would also take the same amount of time. The most convenient way is to go directly through Xinjiang, which only takes five or six days. Therefore, instead of talking about opening a South Asia air route, it is better to focus on resuming the Shanghai-Xinjiang air route.</p>
<p>Building Hangar at Longhua Airport</p>
<p>Since the Eurasia Company moved its airport to Longhua, it has been easy to damage the aircraft when landing and parking in the open field. Therefore, it has been decided to build its own hangar for parking. According to Li, the drawings have already been completed, and the funding is also in place. A board meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss it, and once a formal decision is made, bidding will be invited for construction.</p>
<p>Business Booming Since Price Reduction</p>
<p>In order to provide convenience for passengers, the company has launched a three-month price reduction program last month. It is understood that the business on all routes, except for mail, is very prosperous, which is very different from before the price reduction. As for the combined transport with land and sea, although it is intended to facilitate transportation, the company does not see an urgent need for it in practice, so it will not be realized in the short term.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Money Shops Guild received an order from the Ministry of Finance Qianzi No. 12574, which stated, "The Executive Yuan Secretariat's letter on the case opened, ordered by the President, submitted by the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Special Party Department, regarding (omitted) the long-standing discrimination by money shops in Beijing and Shanghai against dime coins from the 7th to the 10th years of the Republic, mutually refusing to accept them or suppressing their exchange value. Although local administrative agencies have issued public notices to ban this practice, this trend has subsided slightly in recent years, but those who exchange coins still cannot avoid adhering to old habits, discriminating against dime coins, and suppressing exchange rates in order to profit from them, deceiving the common people. It is urgent to strictly prohibit this again in order to prevent manipulation and stabilize the market. In addition to informing the Shanghai and Nanjing Municipal Governments to issue public notices to ban this practice, you are hereby ordered to comply and instruct all money shops not to discriminate against dime coins from the 7th to the 10th years of the Republic and to temporarily allow them to be used in the market until new subsidiary coins are formulated and promulgated. This order." After receiving the order, the guild issued a public notice and sent a letter to the Tobacco and Exchange Guild to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Organizational Methods of Various Marketing Cooperatives <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Stephen is an American marketing cooperative expert. This time, he was hired by Jinling University to lecture on agricultural product marketing cooperation at the university. He previously lectured on various cooperation issues multiple times at the Shanghai Bank Agricultural Cooperation Lecture Hall. Mr. Stephen has rich experience in marketing cooperation. His proposals are indeed an important reference for those in our country who are engaged in and studying marketing cooperation. This article is based on Mr. Stephen's lecture at the bank's agricultural cooperation lecture hall on the morning of February 12, translated by Professor Xu Zhongdi, and recorded by Cheng Mi and Zhu Yaqiang. The original manuscript is reproduced below.</p>
<p>There are many things to pay attention to regarding marketing cooperatives. Among them, the organizational methods of various marketing cooperatives are the most important. The relationship between various cooperatives, the completeness of the organization of each cooperative itself, and whether its method is appropriate are sufficient to affect the success or failure of the cooperative. The organization and management of a cooperative are like a ship at sea, which requires not only a strong hull, but also an experienced captain to manage it. Both must be available in order to sail safely.</p>
<p>A. Prerequisites for the Branch Organization of a Marketing Cooperative (1) The branches of a marketing cooperative should be located in natural areas where agricultural products are concentrated. Therefore, the scope and location of marketing cooperatives are different from those of credit cooperatives. The matters handled by the branches are illustrated by cotton, which includes procedures such as collecting seed cotton, grading, ginning, baling, stacking, storing, and transporting. If taking fruits as an example, it includes procedures such as collecting fruits, washing fruits, inspecting and selecting fruits, grading, packaging, and boxing. Other cooperatives such as tobacco and tea have similar procedures. Therefore, the site must be located in a place where agricultural products are concentrated. (2) The regional scope of marketing cooperatives should not be too small. Because the above-mentioned procedures must have considerable equipment and expenses. If the scope is too small and the agricultural products are too few, it will increase the cost of equipment management and operation required for each unit of agricultural product. However, it should not be too large, because it is not easy for members to deliver agricultural products, which will inevitably affect the cooperative's equipment, budget, and business volume, resulting in inaccurate estimates and increased costs. As for marketing issues, the marketing cooperative may not be able to handle them, and a union should be organized by the branches to handle marketing issues.</p>
<p>B. Organization of the Marketing Cooperative Union The function of the union is to handle the marketing of the products of the branch members. Therefore, there is no need for the union to have processing equipment like the cooperative. The union only creates effective advertising and tries to sell to major city markets. For example, the American Cotton Cooperative Association and the California Fruit Growers Exchange are both union-style organizations. The cooperatives under the latter only handle procedures such as receiving fruits, washing fruits, grading, and packaging. The work of the union's headquarters is to find ways to sell, and to take necessary advertising propaganda and business policies.</p>
<p>C. Organization of Centralized Marketing Cooperatives Centralized cooperatives are different from unions. Each small platform cooperative in the union is independent and can withdraw from the headquarters at any time. However, centralized cooperatives cannot. The members of centralized cooperatives are widely distributed, and their directors are elected separately by the members of each region. In addition to executing the central authority of the entire society, the cooperative's board of directors also manages various businesses in each district of the society, and sets up packaging, grading, and other matters in each district, all of which are transferred according to the intentions of the central agency.</p>
<p>D. Comparison of Union and Centralized Types The policies and management of centralized cooperatives are based solely on the intentions of the manager, who can notify the offices in each district to comply by means of orders, without the consent of the members of each district. This kind of management, if the method is good, is convenient to manage, easy to use, and can achieve rapid results. However, this is not the case with the union-type cooperative, which cannot implement a command-style management policy, but can only guide and explain from the sidelines, and is only advisory in nature. The union's responsibility is only to promote sales, and all other procedures are freely handled by the branches. If the union has new policies and new methods, it can only advise the branches to implement them, and each branch must adopt them after the approval of the board of directors. This is the difference between the centralized and union-type cooperatives. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Inland Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Can Obtain Agents in Shanghai</p>
<p>Other Provinces Willing to Support If They Follow Suit</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to rescue industry and commerce and prosper the market, has established the Shanghai Commodity Marketing Trust Company, with an investment of one million yuan from China and other five banks, and a general office has been established in Shanghai to purchase commodities. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment of Trust Company Director Zhao Dihua of the Department of Finance, in view of the unusual decline of various industries in Jiangsu Province, in order to rescue industry and commerce and prosper the market, has planned to establish the Shanghai Commodity Marketing Trust Company, and invited China Communications, Shanghai Jiangsu Farmers and other five banks to jointly invest. It has been successfully contacted with the Zhenjiang branches of various banks, and the total investment is one million yuan, which will be used as the capital of the trust company. It has been decided to establish a general office in Shanghai and a branch office in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Classification of Business The business of the Shanghai Commodity Marketing Trust Company is: (1) acting as an agent for inland industrial and commercial enterprises to purchase commodities and raw materials in Shanghai; (2) handling mortgage loans and remittances for commodities and raw materials transported to the inland; (3) handling packaging, transportation, insurance, and customs declaration for commodities and raw materials transported to the inland; (4) introducing and promoting various commodities of the industrial and commercial community; (5) acting as an agent to investigate market conditions and supply market information. Those who entrust purchases must first pay 20% of the price. The commission charged is no more than 3%, of which 30% is used as a bonus and the remainder is used as a public reserve fund.</p>
<p>Bank Support The New Sound News Agency reporter yesterday learned from the banking community that they all agreed with the Jiangsu Province Shanghai Commodity Marketing Trust Company. However, the company's accounting is supervised by the investing banks. They have infinite hope for reviving industry and commerce and prospering the market. If other places follow the Jiangsu Province approach, the banks will do their best to help.</p>

<p>Large Amount, Collateral and Repayment Are Very Difficult</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry planned to issue public bonds of 20 million yuan in order to rescue the coal industry. Recently, it was reported that Chen Gongbo of the Ministry of Industry had agreed on detailed measures and was about to print the face value to begin issuing. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry from the National Coal Relief Association and other sources yesterday, the plan for the public bonds has been in place for a long time, but it is really difficult to find suitable collateral for this huge amount of money at one time, and it will be even more difficult to repay the principal and interest in the future. Therefore, the statement of issuing is afraid that it cannot be realized in the short term.</p>

<p>Meeting Held to Discuss Solicitation and Progress</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Solicitation Headquarters of the China Aviation Association previously sent a letter to the captains of various solicitation teams, requesting them to appoint deputy captains and team members to assist in the work in order to assist the captains of various solicitation teams and facilitate the solicitation and fundraising work. In recent days, the captains of various teams have asked to appoint deputy captains and team members to assist in the work. In order to understand the names and addresses of the deputy captains and team members of each team, the headquarters yesterday sent a survey form, asking the captains to fill it out in detail for reply, so as to register and issue appointment letters, and send personnel to contact them at any time to facilitate the progress.</p>
<p>Xu Jianzhang, the captain of the 299th team, is the chairman of the Slaughterhouse Industry Guild. After receiving the letter of appointment, in addition to personally doing his best to solicit members and raise funds for the aviation patriotic movement, he also convened a meeting of various colleagues the day before yesterday to discuss the joint solicitation work. The colleagues took on the role of team members and actively solicited donations from the outside. Xu Jianzhang was also appointed to contact the colleagues in the first and second special zones, and each zone elected one person to serve as the deputy captain to work together.</p>
<p>Ma Jiliang, the captain of the 11th team, requested that Ma Boshen, Ruan Lixian, Zhang Jusheng, and Wu Jiangge be appointed as deputy captains of the team. Wei Shanfu, the captain of the 198th team, requested that Xu Yiming be appointed as the deputy captain of the team.

<p>The China and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road said that the area affected by the drought last year was too large to be supported by its own strength. For the relief of Jiangning and other counties, it could only jointly organize with other charitable organizations to carry out emergency work and conduct relief step by step. Except for the two counties of Liuhe and Jiangning, because the funds had been fully allocated and nothing was left, the disaster relief work was still not enough. According to the disaster area reports, the relief work in Jiangpu, Jurong, Lishui, and Gaochun has been reported that because the wheat season is still far away, there is a shortage of food, and the general disaster victims are in a precarious situation. Now, with the approval to preside over the disaster relief work, Ling Jundao Yang of the Ning Agricultural Relief Association said in a letter that the disaster in (Liuhe) is unique among several counties. Its total area of farmland is 830,000 mu, and the total population is 357,221. The disaster-stricken farmland accounts for 80%, totaling 684,000 mu, and the disaster victims account for about 75%, reaching 269,400 people. According to the field survey, the hungry people are eating grass roots and tree bark. The cultivated fields are willing to put up a mortgage of two yuan per mu, but no one cares. (Jiangning) has a farmland area of 1.43 million mu and a total population of 422,878. The disaster-stricken farmland accounts for about 70%, totaling more than 997,000 mu, and the disaster victims account for 45%, reaching more than 200,000 people. Now that it is the spring famine, they are going out to find food, wandering around, and dying of hunger. People know the vanity of the city, but unfortunately they do not know the poverty of the countryside. How can they bear to feel regret for nothing? As for (Jiangpu), during this spring famine, selling children and eating beef are often heard. (Jurong) The people's livelihood is becoming more and more difficult. The young and strong are doing hard labor, eating from door to door, fleeing famine, and robbing. The old and weak are begging, selling their children, and committing suicide. In short, 97% of the farmers in the whole county are using Guanyin flour, barnyard grass flour, and yam to fill their stomachs. (Lishui) has long been a scorched earth with no life at all. It is not uncommon to see people hanging themselves or starving to death. (Gaochun) has more than 2,000 square miles of red land, with 156,000 disaster victims. Chickens and pigs are sold cheaply and nothing remains. They are now destitute, wandering on the road, and there are dead bodies in the wild. All of these are rare and tragic situations in the world. I think good-hearted gentlemen, concerned about this, will not be able to eat, and I hope to add help to my family. Otherwise, the relief in winter will not help in spring, and the success will fall short, which is really unbearable.</p>

At the same time, the unfinished annual courses of the previous year were also made up. It was a holiday at the end of the month, and the weather was warm and the light was clear, which was most suitable for shooting. Therefore, many personnel from each class of the two teams came to the field to compete. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the monthly cup was competed first. The competition course was 5 shots each of 200-300 yards slow gun and 10 shots of 300 yards rapid gun.

The winning members of the three competitions are listed separately as follows: (1) The water poor competition, that is, the elimination competition, is a kind of assault-style rapid gun sweeping, with the shed as the unit. The fifth and thirteenth sheds competed fiercely in this competition, and the tie-breaker reached five times. But the result was that the third shed won, with competitors Zhang Qixiang, Wang Baoting, Dai Yicheng, and Zhu Jiren. (2) The machine gun competition has four people in each group. The competition is a 300-yard small target. Each group has four pans of bullets, and each person must finish shooting one pan within 20 seconds, with alertness and agility as the winner.

<h3 id="e125">Chung Hwa Book Company Compiles and Prints Junior High School Students' Library <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The extracurricular reading materials for students of all levels of schools have become a serious problem in the education sector in recent years. Although publishers are trying their best to supply them, most of them are for elementary school students. Those that are available for extracurricular reading for secondary school students are mostly too advanced and can only meet the needs of high school students. No one has taken into account the junior high school students who are between high school and elementary school. Recently, in order to meet this need, Chung Hwa Book Company has specially compiled a junior high school student library, which contains 255 kinds of books, totaling 200 volumes. Among them, there are those that provide students with learning methods, such as learning methods for various subjects, table explanations for various subjects, mathematical problems, solutions, guidance, research, etc.; there are those that supplement the lack of textbook knowledge, such as biographies, travel notes, applied science, and shallow explanations of various subjects, etc.; there are those that provide students with the cultivation of life skills, such as planting, animal husbandry, housework, and hygiene, etc.; there are those that provide students with the appreciation of literature and art, such as selected annotated versions of Chinese and English literature, etc.; and there are those that assist in civic training, such as military affairs, national defense, self-cultivation, and vocational guidance, etc. All of these books are compiled by experts and middle school teachers according to their strengths and in accordance with the subjects and levels of junior high school students, without being too lofty or impractical, and with a systematic and interesting approach. Junior high school students who purchase this book can get access to the learning methods of various subjects and arouse their interest in learning various subjects. Schools can also solve the difficulty of selecting extracurricular reading materials by preparing this book. Even elementary school graduates who aspire to further their studies or those who are taking part-time remedial classes can also get rid of the difficulty of finding reading materials. The library is priced at 80 yuan, but is now on sale for half price, only 40 yuan. Those who pay in four installments will pay 44 yuan, that is, 11 yuan each time. Pre-orders will be closed at the end of April, and the entire set will be published in four installments starting from the end of June this year. This is truly good news for secondary school students.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Rare Edition of Water Margin Falls into the Hands of the Japanese <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Only Two Copies Exist in the World</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, Jin Ping Mei, and Water Margin, are among the world's masterpieces. Among them, the rare edition of Water Margin in 100 chapters, criticized by Zhong Bojing, only has two copies in the world. One is stored in the National Library of France in Paris, and the other is the one recently donated by Mr. Kamiya Junji, a guard of the Jinkeima, to the Kyoto Imperial University Library. It is said that there are originally six kinds of Water Margin. The one that is usually known is the popular edition of 120 chapters sold in the market. There are also editions of 70 chapters, 100 chapters, and 50 chapters. Among these types, the 100-chapter edition is the most accurate. Decades ago, China searched for it without success. Unexpectedly, the book has fallen into the hands of Dr. Shi Yan Guwen, an authority in the field of study. The book has no illustrations. The most regrettable thing is that the first page is missing. It is a Ming edition, but the year is unknown. However, on the third page of the twenty-second chapter, there are the words "Jiqingtang Collection." In the future, it should be possible to clarify its system and origin. However, the reason why this book cannot be found in China is due to the disaster of the Qing government's policy of burning books. It is said that the popular edition in the market was compiled by Shi Nai'an of the Yuan Dynasty, and its content and number of chapters are very different from this rare edition.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Feng Zhiqing Leaves a Note and Runs Away <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, Feng Deyuan, courtesy name Zhiqing, from Wuxian County, is 45 years old. He runs a jewelry business and has been the chairman of the Beicheng Business Federation for many years. He is intelligent, capable, and enthusiastic about public welfare and education. He has long been respected in the industry. However, in recent years, due to the influence of society, his financial situation has become unfavorable. However, because he has been in Shanghai for many years, he can still manage to cope. Unexpectedly, Feng did not know what stimulation he received, and he left a note and ran away the day before yesterday. His relatives and friends were all shocked when they heard about it. Upon reviewing the note, it seemed to involve a distaste for the world, but there was no mention of suicide. Later, his family searched everywhere without success. Some suspected that he had shaved his head and entered the mountains. According to his family's statement to reporters, they have inquired in all directions and have not found any debts or anything that would make him unable to stand on his feet. Therefore, the reason for his disappearance is unknown. He left behind four or five children, all of whom are young and without permanent property, so the whole family is likely to commit suicide. His son, Genbo, told reporters that he has been searching for days without any news and will go to Putuo or Hangzhou temples to find him. Otherwise, he is unwilling to live alone in the world. The reporter saw the situation and felt pity. If Mr. Feng's relatives and friends can know his whereabouts and inform him to save his family, it would be a great merit. It is said that Mr. Feng's cowardly behavior is not adopted by the wise, and it is hoped that Mr. Feng himself will be moved in his heart, weigh the pros and cons, and return home automatically, so as to avoid further tragedies.</p>

It is unknown how the Bureau of Social Affairs will approve the handling.</p>

<p>Dr. Wang Ji'an, a medical doctor from the Medical University of Japan, has been practicing medicine in Japan for more than ten years, and has also studied hemorrhoids and has a lot of experience. Recently, based on scientific principles, he has invented a variety of miraculous medicines for hemorrhoids. No matter how old or malignant the hemorrhoids or fistulas are, or other anal diseases, they can be cured by taking medicine without surgery or pain. In particular, in the field of hemorrhoids in China, although there are specialists, there are no good medicines, and patients all feel regretful. It is now heard that Dr. Wang has set up a clinic at No. 202, 2nd Floor, Women's Bank, Nanjing Road, telephone number 91309.</p>

<p>New Houses Have Many Features</p>
<p>Completed in the Summer of This Year</p>
<p>In order to prosper the city center and solve the housing problem for citizens, the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company, in addition to building the first batch of houses, which had already been sold out, is now building the second batch of houses. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to Mr. Tan Boying, the manager of the company, yesterday, and he told him about various things. The details are as follows: Mr. Tan said that the company's establishment is to focus on public undertakings and public affairs related to the municipal government, and does not aim to make profits. The company believes that in the city center,</p>
<p>The environment is beautiful, the municipal government has far-sighted plans, and the mayor is making every effort to build without hesitation. In addition to the completion of the road system, major buildings such as the sports field, library, museum, and municipal hospital will be completed this year. Therefore, the development of the city center in the future is limitless. The company built the first batch of 37 houses in the year before last. More than half of them had been ordered before the project was completed. When it was completely completed, it had been sold out. As for the buyers,</p>
<p>The occupation statistics can be divided into the following types: (1) Administrative officials, (2) University presidents, (3) Chinese and Western doctors, (4) Business circles, (5) Financial circles, (6) Senior tax officers, (7) Public officials at sea, etc. All homeowners have expressed satisfaction since moving in. In order to further serve the public, the company has built shops and small vegetable markets near the new houses. Foods and vegetables for daily life are all available. The second house is now being built between Zhayin Road and Minfu Road, a stone's throw away from the first house. Speaking of</p>
<p>The characteristics of the new house lie in the ingenious design, free from vulgarity. The exterior is all made of stucco cement, mixed with colored powder, and decorated with the latest style of facade tiles, which is extremely beautiful. The interior decoration is purely modern. The outer walls are all made of steel windows, and the light is exceptionally abundant. Other things such as the layout of the kitchen, the placement of the dish cabinets, as well as the hot and cold water pipes, sanitary ware, and the equipment of electric light lines, all do their best to design. The lower floor has a large reception room, dining room, and sun room. The upper floor has a large balcony. No matter whether it is in the cold winter or hot summer, there is no feeling of severe cold or heat. In addition, there is a wide space for planting a large number of flowers and plants, and the remaining space can be used as a tennis court. In short, the design this time can achieve the purpose of an ideal house. As for</p>
<p>The method of payment, regardless of type A or type B, still adopts the method of paying in installments, which can be divided into three years, four years, five years, and six years. This batch of houses has been under construction for many days and will be completed in the summer of this year. In recent days, there has been no shortage of people who have made reservations with the company.</p>

<p>Dancing Hall Accident</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that on Saturday night last week, British Navy sailor Cochrane of the HMS Grimsby, along with his friend Baldwin, went to the Crystal Dancing Hall on Rue Chu Pao-san in the French Concession to enjoy dancing. His dance partner was a Russian dancer, and the two were very intimate, which ignited the jealousy of Ponsard, a sergeant in the French Colonial Army infantry who had feelings for the dancer. Around 4:00 AM on Sunday morning, as the dancing hall closed and Cochrane and his friend exited, Ponsard took advantage of their unpreparedness and shot at them, the bullet hitting Cochrane in the head. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing his objective achieved, the assailant fled. Cochrane's friend Baldwin gave chase but was ultimately unable to catch him. At this time, patrol officers arrived, disarmed him, and took him into custody. Cochrane was rushed to the Country Hospital, and after surgery performed by naval and civilian surgeons yesterday afternoon, his condition today (the 4th) remains critical. However, hospital staff stated there is hope for recovery. It is reported that the assailant, Ponsard, will be tried by a naval court, and the severity of his punishment will depend on whether Cochrane recovers.</p>

<p>After Interrogation by the Detective</p>
<p>It Was Discovered the Dispute Arose From Gambling</p>
<p>Around 4:00 AM the day before yesterday, Xue Zhiwen, the head Chinese detective of the Lao Zha precinct, was patrolling his jurisdiction. At 4:45 AM, while passing the entrance of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road, he saw Wu Delin, a man from Anhui, exit the hotel covered in blood. Detective Xue stopped him and inquired about the cause of the bleeding. Wu claimed that several Cantonese men had opened a gambling den in room 613 of the hotel, and he had participated in the gambling. It had been going on from around 9:00 PM until the present time. However, half an hour prior, six or seven people dressed in gray suddenly arrived, claiming to be detectives from the police station. They confiscated the cash on the table and on the gamblers, and also took away the pai gow tiles. Everyone gambling inside was Cantonese except for him, an Anhui native. They suspected him of being an informant, so they beat him severely and stabbed him in the head with a knife. Then, they changed rooms to room 311 on the third floor. Detective Xue then led a Chinese police officer to room 311 and arrested nine Cantonese men: Liang Rong, Wang Fei, Zhang De, Deng You, Hu Zhen, Feng San, Chen Sheng, Shi Zhenxiong, and Zhu Qiaosheng. Inside the room, they confiscated a mahjong set, smoking paraphernalia, and two daggers. Then, they went to room 613 and arrested two men from Anhui: Hu Zigao and Fang Deming. At that time, Wang Yingjie and Weng Hongxun, Chinese detectives from the Lao Zha precinct, arrived with a prison wagon. As they were about to put the suspects on the wagon, a Cantonese man named He Hai stepped forward and told the suspects that he could find guarantors for them. The detective suspected He might also be involved and arrested him as well. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the situation, stating that the case had not yet been fully investigated and requesting permission to detain them temporarily. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Theft Case of a St. Anna Dancing Girl <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Miao Jianpei is Suspected</p>
<p>But No Evidence Was Found</p>
<p>Miao Jianpei, a woman from Wuxi, is twenty-five years old, with a graceful figure and beautiful appearance. She once worked as a dancing girl at the St. Anna Dance Hall. Because of poor health, she quit the embracing lifestyle and settled at number 148 Guling Road, focusing on medical treatment. Now that her health has recovered, to maintain her livelihood, she was recently rehired by St. Anna and resumed her old profession, starting to dance again on Saturday last week (the 2nd). However, according to St. Anna's regulations for managing dancing girls, all dancing girls must dance until 4:00 AM the next morning before being allowed to leave. The dance hall provides a car for transportation. Due to her weakened condition after illness, Miss Miao found it difficult to endure. She felt exhausted after dancing until 3:50 AM the day before yesterday (Sunday). She went to the cloakroom to retrieve her stored coat, handbag, and other items and hired a rickshaw home. Around 4:00 AM, the other dancing girls finished dancing and returned home. However, when the dancing girl Mai Shaoqiong went to Wang Liu, the woman in charge of the cloakroom, to retrieve her stored items, she suddenly discovered that a handbag, containing 40 yuan in dance tickets, 45 yuan in cash, and other cosmetics valued at around 105 yuan, was missing. After a thorough investigation, there were no clues. Wang Liu stated that no one had been there except for the dancing girl Miao Jianpei, who had retrieved her belongings and went home by herself. Therefore, Miao was suspected of being involved in the theft, and the police were notified. Detectives were sent to arrest Miao Jianpei, but a search revealed no stolen goods. Miao was taken to the police station and then to the women's detention center. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division Two. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, filed charges for theft, based on the accusation of Wang Liu, a Cantonese woman who was in charge of the cloakroom and bathrooms at the St. Anna Dance Hall. All dancing girls must store their belongings upon entry, which she would keep safe. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the defendant arrived and retrieved her stored items, which she handed over. At the time, another dancing girl came to retrieve her belongings, and she went to another room to fetch them. Later, Mai Shaoqiong suddenly discovered that her handbag was stolen. Since only the defendant was standing in front of the closet at the time, it was certain that the defendant had stolen it. When questioned, Miao Jianpei stated that on Saturday night last week, it was her first time dancing at St. Anna. Because she felt exhausted at 3:50 AM the next morning, she hired a car home herself. Her residence was not far from the dance hall, and the dance hall's transportation car required ten people to ride together, sending people off in segments, which was quite uncomfortable. Therefore, she hired a rickshaw home and did not steal anyone's handbag. She hired lawyer Wu Peng to defend her in court. After Judge Ye Shengchao reviewed the statements, he stated that further investigation of the case was necessary. He ordered Miao Jianpei to provide a reliable guarantor, to be available upon summon and postponed the hearing for seven days.</p>

<p>Old Woman Injured Her Leg</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the Zhu Yuanzhen Silk Shop at number 6, alley 397 on Jiujiang Road, around 5:30 AM yesterday morning. Within a short time, the fire had broken through the roof, with flames blazing. The Central Fire Brigade was alerted and quickly dispatched pump trucks to the scene to put out the fire with water. It took an hour to extinguish the fire. As a result, the Zhu Yuanzhen Silk Shop was completely destroyed. The fire also affected the upper floors of the neighboring buildings at numbers 4 and 8, causing slight damage. When the fire was raging, Sun Jianquan (75 years old) and Zhang Shao (59 years old), an elderly couple from Ningbo, were on the upper floor of number 6. Because the staircase had been burned through, they had no way to escape and jumped from the window. Sun injured his left arm and back, and Zhang injured her leg. They were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance number 83. However, Sun died shortly afterward due to his severe injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Fire at the Continental Arcade <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Carelessness by the Engineers' Society</p>
<p>Valuable Books Suffered Great Loss</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the Chinese Engineers' Society, room 542, on the fifth floor of the Continental Arcade on Nanjing Road, at 6:30 AM yesterday morning. Zhou Kui, a tea boy (24 years old, from Jinshan) who worked at the society, had already gotten up and gone to wash his face and use the restroom. When he returned to the room after finishing, he saw smoke billowing and flames blazing. Realizing that carelessness had caused the fire, he immediately ran out and reported it to the Central Patrol Station and the Fire Brigade, who dispatched vehicles to the scene. When the fire engines arrived at the Continental Arcade on Jiujiang Road, they did not know which section of the building had caught fire. After inquiring, they learned it was on the fifth floor. However, because the society was located very high, the water pipes had to be wound up the escalators, requiring a lot of time, causing the fire to rage fiercely. Fortunately, with the efforts of the firefighters, the fire was extinguished in about half an hour. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency went to investigate. Qiu Xie jun, the secretary-general of the society, had already arrived after hearing the news. He said that the society was formed by the merger of the former Chinese Engineers' Society and the Chinese Engineering Society. The president is Xu Peihuang, the current director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, and the vice president is Yun Zhen. There are over two hundred members who usually discuss engineering issues. They also have thousands of valuable reference books on chemical engineering, mining engineering, mechanical engineering, and other subjects, as well as hundreds of new books on reinforced concrete published by the society itself, stored upstairs. All of these were destroyed in the fire, which is a great pity. Many of the reference books were unique copies, difficult to collect, and given by engineering societies from various countries, which the society greatly valued. Therefore, they had insurance coverage of 8,000 yuan from the Dahua Insurance Company on Beijing Road. However, he did not know how the fire started because he had not witnessed it. He said that only a Zhou-surnamed worker stayed in the society and was usually careful and did not smoke. The total amount of the loss could not be estimated at the time. Xu Peihuang, the president of the society, also personally visited the scene after the incident.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Gong Shaoting's Murder of His Mistress Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Trial Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled for the 9th</p>
<p>The key suspect in the sensational Jia Bei dismemberment case, Gong Shaoting, and his mistress Gong Hou, out of jealousy, strangled his former mistress Xie Aiqiao in the middle of the night, then cut off her head, and buried her body at the old site of Gong Hongtai Construction Factory, formerly run by Gong Shaoting on Gongxing Road in Zhabei, under the newly built bungalows. After the incident, only the headless body was recovered; her head has not been found. Gong Hou, who initiated the crime, Gong Shaoting, and Zhou Baoquan and Li Baosheng, who helped move the body, were successively arrested by the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. They confessed to plotting to kill Xie Aiqiao and revealed that a fugitive accomplice, Shen Fufu, was still at large. They were transferred to the local court as ordered. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang interrogated the two suspects, Gong Shaoting and Gong Hou, for premeditated murder and destruction of a corpse, which violated Article 284, paragraph 1, clause 1, and Article 262, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code. Zhou Baoquan and Li Baosheng were charged with abandoning a corpse, which violated Article 262, paragraph 1. A public prosecution was filed. Judge Zhang Shao once opened a trial, during which Gong Shaoting and Gong Hou recanted their previous confessions and denied everything. The judge ordered a further hearing. It is now learned that this case was reopened in the Fifth Tribunal yesterday morning at 10:00 AM by Judge Zhang Shao. The plaintiff, Xie Baolin, retained lawyer Song Shixiang to appear in court and request private compensation of 6,000 yuan. Gong Shaoting, Gong Hou, and others retained three lawyers, Peng Qixiu, Pan Zhenya, and Wu Xigong, who appeared in court to defend them. After the judge took the bench, he first called the plaintiff, Xie Baolin, to the case and asked, "During the last hearing, you said that Chen Zhangzhang informed you about Xie Aiqiao's murder. Therefore, you were ordered to invite Chen Zhangzhang to court. Has Chen Zhangzhang come today?" Xie replied, "I don't have a deep relationship with Chen Zhangzhang. We only met while drinking tea at the same teahouse. He certainly told me about this matter, but I haven't seen him come to drink tea for a long time, so there was no way to invite him." The judge asked, "How much private compensation are you requesting?" Xie replied, "Six thousand yuan." The judge ordered Gong Shaoting to be brought to the case and asked, "Does the deceased have any relatives? She only has an older sister, no one else." The judge asked, "Where are you from?" Gong replied, "Gaoqiao, Pudong." The judge asked, "During your previous confession, you said that when the deceased ran away, you went to Suzhou. Why did you say you went to the countryside in the reward notice? It's clear that your statements are inconsistent. Where were you at that time?" Gong replied, "I really went to Suzhou on business because I took on construction work in Suzhou, so I often went there." The judge asked, "You clearly confessed to the Public Security Bureau that Xie Aiqiao was murdered by Hou and your son-in-law Shen Fufu, etc." Gong replied, "It's a miscarriage of justice. I couldn't bear the suffering and confessed randomly." The judge said, "Then how is it that the place you indicated matches the place where the body was found, which is completely consistent with the facts?" Gong was speechless. Next, Gong Hou was brought to the case. The judge asked, "Why did you murder Xie Aiqiao?" Gong replied, "That is not the case." The judge asked, "You confessed very clearly in the Public Security Bureau. Are you still trying to quibble?" Gong replied, "It's a miscarriage of justice." After receiving the confession, the judge ordered Zhou Baoquan and Li Baosheng to be brought to the case. They both testified that they were ordered by the boss to move the remains, and they did not know anything else. At this point, prosecutor Lei Binzhang rose and argued, stating, "The murder of Xie Aiqiao has been around two years now. According to Zhou Baoquan, Gong Shaoting spent sixty yuan to hire people to dig up the body and rebury it elsewhere. Because the smell was offensive, Li Baosheng and others only moved the head. It can be said that the net of heaven is wide, and none can escape. When committing the crime, they first strangled her with a rope and then cut off her head. At that time, the neck blood had not yet congealed. According to the confession, Shen Fufu and a worker killed her. Moreover, according to Gong Shaoting's confession, because the deceased was tyrannical, the workers harbored resentment and plotted to harm her. Afterwards, Gong posted a notice stating that the deceased had run away, and then ordered Zhou Baoquan and others to dig up the body and rebury it elsewhere. This kind of evidence shows a strong suspicion of conspiracy. As for Zhou Baoquan, Li Baosheng, and others, they confessed to moving the body, and they only moved the head. Moreover, according to the Forensic Research Institute, the head was cut off not long after the strangulation. Please deliver a public verdict." The judge then ordered the start of the debate. The lawyers rose one after another and argued eloquently for a long time. As a result, the judge asked Gong Shaoting if he had a final statement. Gong replied, "My woman (referring to the deceased) is named Xie Aiqiao, also called Xie Baolin. There is also Xie Baolin's name on my sachet. Why is Xie Baolin now suing me? Isn't this a strange thing?" After receiving the confession, the judge considered the conclusion, scheduled the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the 9th of this month, and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody pending the decision.</p>

<p>The reason why we use the figures from 1930 as a standard is because at that time, Japan had not yet launched a military invasion to occupy our four northeastern provinces, and Sino-Japanese trade was in a normal state. But from the table, US-Japan trade is still above China. However, the US-Japan trade is mostly raw silk. Japan's export of raw silk to the United States accounts for 27 percent of its total exports and 96 percent of Japan's total raw silk exports. If Japan loses the US market, except for the silk industry, other industries will not be affected in any way. If it loses the Chinese market, Japan's entire industry will suffer a great blow.

<h3 id="e153">Former Yixing County Magistrate Arrested in Shanghai for Embezzling 20,000 Yuan in Public Funds <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>After Years of Secret Investigation, He Was Finally Arrested Recently</p>
<p>The First Special Court Approved His Transfer to the Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>Zhou Yanan, a native of Hunan, 46 years old, once held a position in the military and was later transferred to serve as the county magistrate of Yixing County, Jiangsu. He was dismissed from his post in January 1928. After an investigation by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it was discovered that Zhou had embezzled as much as 20,000 yuan in public funds during his tenure. The provincial government sent personnel to secretly investigate Zhou's whereabouts, but for many years, they found nothing. The provincial government issued a wanted notice in the newspapers. Recently, it was discovered that Zhou Yanan was hiding at number 35 Puqing Lane, Malan Road, in the French Concession of Shanghai. The provincial government sent a representative, Wang Ziying, with documents to Shanghai. Around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, he encountered Zhou on Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession. He had Chinese detective Sun Jishan and Chinese constable number 2587 take Zhou to the Chengdu Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and lawyer Fan Gang, retained by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, applied for permission to transfer him, and police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that this case was one of assistance. Since Zhou was taken into custody at the police station, he admitted to owing only 2,000 yuan. Therefore, the Municipal Council did not oppose the transfer. Subsequently, Wang Ziying submitted official documents stating that he was a member of the Department of Finance and, after discovering that Zhou owed 20,000 yuan in public funds during his tenure, had been issued a wanted notice by the provincial government. Therefore, he requested the transfer. When questioned, Zhou Yanan stated that during his tenure, subordinates had been harmed by the Communist Party, so he spent 2,000 yuan on medical expenses, which he had reported to the provincial government for approval. After being dismissed, he went to Guizhou to handle affairs, etc. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the statements and ordered that Zhou Yanan be allowed to be taken back for trial by the staff of the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Conclusion of the Case of Han Yun'gen's Son's Engagement to a Dancing Girl <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Yang Qingyuan Testified in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Stating That He Was Not Drunk or Confused When Signing the Contract</p>
<p>Han Yun'gen, a native of Ningbo who once served as the president of a certain bank, is known for his wealth. After resigning from his position as president, he switched to various other businesses. His adopted son, Han Peixian, is young and romantic and particularly fond of singing and dancing. Every evening, he would frequent various dance halls. Wang Xiaomei, the dance queen of the Great Shanghai Dance Hall, had a specially made small coffin carried to her home as a gift last summer, using it as a gimmick. Her fame increased as a result, and Peixian became even more enamored of her and grew closer. By last summer, their love had reached a boiling point, and they vowed to grow old together. On May 29th, they went to lawyer Yang Qingyuan's office to sign an engagement contract, specifying that they would marry within the year. If they failed to do so, Peixian would pay a penalty of 10,000 silver dollars. Later, Han Yun'gen learned of this and hired a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper and to prevent his son's dissolute behavior. Therefore, Peixian did not fulfill the contract, and Wang Xiaomei filed a lawsuit for breach of contract and damages. Since the contract was signed, not only did Xiaomei reject proposals from other men, but she also retired from her dancing career. Last month, the First Special District Court summoned both parties for questioning and ordered Han Peixian to negotiate a settlement with the plaintiff out of court. However, the defendant has not yet complied and has not expressed any willingness to resolve the matter peacefully, apparently because his father, Han Yun'gen, has not given Peixian the money, making it impossible for him to approach the other party. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the continued hearing arrived. The defendant, Han Peixian, knew that he was wrong and avoided appearing in court. His defense lawyer was also absent. Only the plaintiff, her lawyer, and the witness Yang Qingyuan appeared in court. Judge Peng ordered Yang to testify regarding the circumstances of signing the engagement contract. Lawyer Yang stated that Han Peixian and Wang Xiaomei came to his office on Avenue Edward VII that day and requested that he draft an engagement contract. At the time, Han Peixian was of sound mind and was not drunk or confused. The content of the contract was dictated by Han, and he wrote the draft according to Han's intentions. After Han reviewed and approved it in detail, he corrected it and wrote it in triplicate. Han and Wang each took one copy, and the remaining copy was kept in his office. He repeatedly asked about his ability to pay the 10,000 tael penalty specified in the contract in case of breach. Han firmly stated that he had assets and did not need to worry. He personally witnessed them sign and also signed as a witness. The plaintiff's lawyer then stood up and claimed that the defendant's father, Han Yun'gen, had already agreed to give him 800,000 in property and had already specified the types of property. Therefore, he was not concerned about the small amount of damages in this case. Judge Peng stated that the facts of the case were clear, and the defendant was absent without reason. He ordered the plaintiff to begin the final arguments alone and ordered a postponement for sentencing on a set date.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Li Gongying vs. Zhang Yingda Shanghai Billiards Final <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Li Scored 222 Points More Yesterday on the First Day</p>
<p>The Final Victory or Defeat Depends on Today's Two Matches</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Class A Billiards Competition is attended by famous Chinese and Western billiards players from all over Shanghai. The outcome determines who receives the championship, which is respectfully called the Shanghai Billiards King, truly deserving the title. In the past, those who competed for this throne were our country's Li Gongying and the Portuguese Mydina. This year is different. Mydina, who was said to have the highest hopes, was defeated by our country's famous player Zhang Yingda. Yesterday's final showdown was between our country's Li Gongying and Zhang Yingda, which is unprecedented in this competition and something to be proud of.</p>
<p>First Day's Progress Towards the Championship</p>
<p>The final totals 2,000 points, divided into two days, with 1,000 points each day. Yesterday was the first day, starting at 5:30 PM at the Victoria Recreation Club. Since defeating Mydina, Zhang has been in the limelight. Sure enough, within the first ten shots, he took the lead, somewhat able to compete with Billiards King Li Gongying, and remained in the leading position. Unexpectedly, he suddenly stopped at 355 points. At this time, Li Gongying was lagging behind at 305 points, taking the opportunity to score consecutive big numbers, such as 67 and 76, and soon caught up with over a hundred points, ending the first round with 500 points compared to 393. The second round started at 9:00 PM. Li Gongying's performance was more brilliant than before. Although Zhang tried his best to resist, he was no match for the old hero. Throughout the competition, Li's experience was rich, and he was able to give full play to his skills. However, in terms of individual performance, Zhang has made clear progress. Li is not as perfect as last year.</p>
<p>Let's See Who Wins Today</p>
<p>After the first day's result, Li won with 1,000 points compared to 778. There are two more final rounds today. According to observations from all sides, Li can still maintain the title of Billiards King. But a scholar who has been away for three days should be looked at with new eyes. Zhang has already been able to defeat Mydina, who knows if he can overcome Li Gongying? Looking at the first thirty shots before the first round yesterday, Zhang was indeed ahead of Li. Therefore, although there is hope, he must work harder. The highest scores of the two yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Gongying 28, 31, 62, 47, 26, 37, 67, 76, 46, 39, 51, 38, 66, 30, 32, 35</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda 59, 30, 20, 69, 54, 25, 31, 25, 46, 21</p>

Besides the arrival in the Philippines,</p>
<p>Luggage Just Unpacked, Warm Welcome</p>
<p>Various groups on the Philippine Islands, after learning about the arrival of the Liangjiang team, went to the port to greet them. At 3 PM on the 11th, when the President Jefferson approached the Manila pier, the Liangjiang students were all wearing snow-white domestically produced silk cheongsams, with short hair and extremely strong bodies. They lined up neatly, leaning against the ship's railing, waving flags and hands with those welcoming them. Dozens of groups, including the Overseas Chinese Sports Association, the Consulate General, the General Chamber of Commerce, the YMCA, the Party Headquarters, and newspaper offices, sent representatives on board to greet them. The hosts and guests shook hands with great enthusiasm. The Sports Association provided vehicles to transport all the luggage to the villa of Yang Qitai, the president of the Association, for accommodation. The villa has everything, including a gymnasium, tennis court, volleyball court, basketball court, music room, and reading room. Living there is very comfortable. There are a total of five Chinese newspapers in the area, as well as more than ten Western and Philippine newspapers.

<p>Miserable Defeat by the American Army in the First Clash</p>
<p>The competition matters are handled by the Philippine Overseas Chinese Sports Association. A total of four teams were invited: the American Central School women's team, the Philippine All-Star team, and the Xiamen Qunhui team, which won the Fujian Provincial Championship, for a double round-robin competition. Tickets were priced at 50 cents and one yuan. It started on February 15th. The first match was between Liangjiang and Central, held at the St. Thomas University basketball court at 7:45 PM. The referee was Bao Dishi, a former national athlete. Because of the reputation of both sides, the compatriots gathered enthusiastically. The entire Liangjiang team wore white shirts and green pants, looking refreshed. The entire audience applauded and welcomed them, and the atmosphere was very strong. During practice, their footwork was agile and their shots were accurate. The American team was all in white, with uneven builds. At 7:45 PM, the game began, and the audience's applause was thunderous. The Sports Association also temporarily organized a cheerleading team for Liangjiang, consisting of students from the Overseas Chinese Girls' School. At the start of the game, the beautiful women took the lead, scoring one point for Liangjiang with a free throw. After that, Chen Rongming scored six points in a row. Her speed in passing the ball and accuracy in shooting amazed the entire audience. After that, the momentum became one-sided. Liangjiang ended the first quarter with a score of 16-1. In the second quarter, Liangjiang's momentum continued, ending with a score of 29-3. With the victory in hand, Liangjiang called back its main players, Chen Rongming and Chen Jucai, and replaced them with Wang Shikun and Chen Meifeng, adopting a policy of passing without attacking. The American team took this opportunity to bring in the strong player Okika, and the momentum was indeed different. In addition, Pan Meng left the court due to cramps, giving the American army a chance to counterattack. In this quarter, the American army took the lead with 6 to 4. In the last quarter, Liangjiang brought back its main players, and finally won a great victory with a score of 49-13.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Hubei Education Department Formulates Literacy Education Plan <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Utilizing Students</p>
<p>Eliminate Illiteracy</p>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The Hubei Provincial Department of Education, in order to eliminate illiteracy, will start with the provincial capital and formulate the "Outline of the Literacy Education Plan for the Hubei Provincial Capital," which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>Utilize students from senior primary schools and above in the provincial capital to take turns teaching illiterate people aged ten to fifty in the provincial capital, so that they can read and exercise. (1) The Department of Education is responsible for organizing the Hubei Provincial Capital Illiteracy Elimination Corps, with the headquarters set up in the Department of Education, and the school as the unit, with branch headquarters set up in the school. (2) The headquarters of the corps will have one chief and one deputy chief, filled by the governor and the director of the Department of Education. Underneath will be two sections: administrative and supervisory, each with a director. Under the administrative section, there will be document, general affairs, accounting, and statistics groups, each with several staff members. The supervisory section will have several supervisors, assigned to each branch headquarters of the corps, responsible for inspection and guidance. The directors, staff members, and supervisors of each group will be concurrently appointed by the chiefs and deputy chiefs from the staff of various educational institutions. (3) Each branch headquarters of the corps will have several members, who will elect one chief and one deputy chief to be directed by the headquarters and the supervisor to preside over the affairs of the branch. The number of supervisors will be determined according to the standard of one supervisor for every ten members.</p>
<p>Zoning</p>
<p>The provincial capital will be divided into several teaching zones based on the number of schools, as the target of teaching. The size of the area will be determined based on the number of students and the size of each school. Zoning will be handled in conjunction with the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. Although there are no accurate surveys or statistics on the number of illiterate people in the provincial capital, it is estimated based on general academic principles that with a population of 300,000, there are approximately 180,000 illiterate people. Two terms will be divided each year, and each term is scheduled to teach 10,000 illiterate people, so that illiteracy will be eliminated in approximately nine years.</p>
<p>Members</p>
<p>(1) Each term is scheduled to have 3,000 members, initially filled by members of the youth service corps in each school, and then rotated with other students, so that each student can serve. (2) Members will take one to two hours each day to teach in the homes of illiterate people in the designated teaching area, and must teach at least three illiterate people, until the entire literacy textbook is completed. Illiterate people may be forced to attend school if necessary. (3) After a member identifies the illiterate people they are teaching, they will report to the branch headquarters, which will forward the report to the headquarters for record. (4) Members who are deemed to have excellent performance by the supervisor will be awarded prizes at the end of the term to encourage them. Those with poor performance will have their work grades in the school deducted as a warning.</p>
<p>Supervision</p>
<p>Each supervisor is responsible for examining and guiding ten members. The methods are: (1) Random supervision, with the supervisor supervising at any time at their discretion. (2) Regular assessment, with regular assessments when members have taught to a certain point, in order to change the curriculum. The curriculum is temporarily set to literacy, and the textbooks will be prepared and distributed by the headquarters.</p>
<p>Expenses</p>
<p>The budget is temporarily set at 9,000 yuan per term, provided by the provincial treasury. The budget is as follows: (1) Textbook fees: 24 cents per book per person per term, totaling 2,400 yuan. (2) Literacy certificate fees: 2 cents per certificate, totaling 200 yuan. (3) Prize fees: an average of 2 yuan per person, totaling 60 yuan. (4) Headquarters office expenses: 400 yuan per term.</p>

<p>Pre-exhibition in Shanghai to be Postponed</p>
<p>Method of Transporting to England Undecided</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 4th dispatch) Wang Shijie, director of the preparatory committee for the London Exhibition's review and re-selection of antiquities in Shanghai, previously dispatched Lei Zhen, director of the Ministry of Education, to Shanghai to assist in all matters. Lei returned to Beijing on the morning of the 4th. David and Raphael, the British commissioners sent to select and transport antiquities, also arrived in Beijing on the same train. Lei led them to meet with Minister Wang Shijie to discuss matters such as the safe transportation of antiquities to England. David and Raphael will stay for three or four days, visit President Wang, tour famous scenic spots, and then return to Shanghai. Lei stated that the review and re-selection of antiquities is being continued by the various preparatory committees in Shanghai. The pre-exhibition date, originally the 20th of this month, will inevitably be postponed if the selection cannot be completed by then. It has been decided that the exhibited antiquities will be transported to England in batches in June. Whether England will send a special ship to China for loading is currently undecided.</p>

<p>Proclamation Ensuring the Safety of Antiquities Sent Abroad</p>
<p>The China Art Education Society held its third regular board meeting at its clubhouse on Wenmiao Road yesterday. Executive directors Ma Gongyu, Yan Kechang, and Shi Chongpeng, directors Fu Boliang, Zhu Zhiwei, Wang Yunzhi, Shen Elou, Zhu Yunying, Shi Wenbin, and Zhang Chenbo attended. He Mingzhai and Mo Yunxuan were present as observers, and supervisors Chen Songchun, Ding Nianxian, and Wang Longzhang were present. Shi Chongpeng chaired the meeting, and Zhu Zhiwei recorded the minutes. The meeting began at 7:00 PM as usual. After the reports of each group's work were completed, discussions began on the compilation and publication of a weekly memorial issue to commemorate the founding of the society, as well as the holding of an exhibition. Regarding the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art, the selection of antiquities, and the long journey across the ocean, the board resolved to send a letter to the organizing committee requesting a clear proclamation to the people regarding the issue of ensuring the safety of the antiquities sent abroad, in order to dispel public doubts. Yan Kechang was immediately appointed to draft the letter, which was to be passed by the executive directors and then implemented. The society's letter to the London Art Exhibition is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Respectful greetings. Previously, the government, at the request of the British, selected antiquities to be transported to England for the International Exhibition of Chinese Art to be held in London in November of this year, allowing international audiences to gain a deep and widespread understanding of ancient Chinese art. The government's intention to promote national culture and foster Sino-British friendship is deeply admired by all our citizens. However, these rare antiquities are truly the essence of our Chinese nation's five thousand years of culture. In recent years, the nation's preservation efforts have not been fully adequate, resulting in either theft by corrupt officials or smuggling for profit by unscrupulous merchants. For example, the theft case at the Forbidden City remains unsolved, and we have not heard of the recovery of national treasures detained in Marseille. The continuous loss of protection has implications for the nation's fate, and thinking of this is deeply unsettling. The types and ages of the antiquities to be transported to England were specified by the British, and they also sent personnel to China to select them, which some observers believe undermines national dignity. Moreover, given the ever-changing international situation and the disparity in national power between our two countries, does our government truly have the confidence that it can ensure the safety of these numerous antiquities, the essence of thousands of years of national culture, during their long journey across the ocean, without any unforeseen risks? While it is said that there is legitimate insurance, how is its value assessed, and which country's company is underwriting this insurance? The government has not yet issued a clear statement on this matter, and the people remain deeply concerned. Therefore, while our society fully supports this grand exhibition, we cannot help but be overly concerned about the issue of ensuring the safety of the antiquities. Therefore, it is difficult to remain silent, and we hereby earnestly submit this letter, hoping that your committee will provide a concrete statement regarding measures to ensure the safety of the antiquities, and announce it to the public to clarify the situation and dispel public doubts. We eagerly await your response.</p>

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Watching the people on the trams, either crowding at the front to cool off, or tightly closing the doors to keep out the cold wind, one can tell that "spring" and "autumn" are changing.</p>
<p>The city is prosperous, and this year is "Children's Year" again. However, here, we see twelve- or thirteen-year-old boys pulling rickshaws, fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girls selling their souls, and a mournful cry of "selling children" echoing along the desolate streets.</p>
<p>Young people always want to transform society, but by middle age they only want to cling to it, and by old age they are afraid of even being able to hold onto it.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Mr. Qiu <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Zi</p>
<p>What kind of person is Mr. Qiu? Let me give a basic introduction.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu is a young man in his thirties. Last winter, he came to Beijing with his new wife, Ms. Cai, intending to find a job in Beijing to serve society and the country. However, he had no influential relatives and was unwilling to be obsequious. He has been living idly in Beijing for almost two months, and the year has turned new, but he remains the same. Mr. Qiu does not adopt a passive attitude, which sets him apart from most young people today.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu is a survivor of many battles, now unemployed for two months, becoming an "idle officer." His temperament can be described as "still as a virgin, swift as a hare." He is very fond of embroidery, saying that it is more interesting than any other pastime. In these two months, he has completed two pairs of embroidered pillows, with delicate craftsmanship and harmonious colors. My wife and neighboring women all praise him, calling him a "man of both literary and martial talents." I would rather call him a "man of both male and female talents." The ancient winter solstice poem says, "Who first notices the lengthening of the day by a thread? It is the embroiderers in the red boudoir." Now, even Mr. Qiu's footprints can be found in the red boudoir team, truly a lucky man!</p>
<p>He is also skilled in tailoring, sewing, mending socks, etc. When he has nothing to do, he often asks me, "Do you have any socks to mend?" which is very interesting.</p>
<p>Recently, Tan'er returned home for the winter vacation. Since I have to go out in the morning and afternoon, Mr. Qiu has become a genuine tutor, and sometimes he takes Tan'er to Nanjing Jimingsi Moqiu Lake to learn sketching.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu has lived in my house for a full ten weeks. Now, Mr. Qiu has packed his bags and gone to the Lushan Military Training Corps. Spring returns to the earth, and a bright future awaits. I wish Mr. Qiu all the best for the country!</p>
<h3 id="e179">Landscape of the North Station <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>The Shanghai North Railway Station, rebuilt after the January 28th Incident, is a rather magnificent fortress.</p>
<p>In this fortress-like station, countless people from the city to the countryside and from the countryside to the city are swallowed and spat out every day – people struggling on the lifeline.</p>
<p>Before each train departs, the travelers either have relaxed smiles on their faces or depressed expressions. After each train arrives, the travelers spat out by the train also have either relaxed smiles on their faces or depressed expressions.</p>
<p>On the platform, departing lovers often wave their handkerchiefs until the train has been dragged out of the platform. Indeed, the most unbearable thing in the world is parting. But at the moment the train arrives, the travelers who embrace their loved ones waiting on the platform, talking and laughing as they walk out of the station in pairs, that sweetness is so unforgettable.</p>
<p>In the waiting room, the rows of benches are always filled with people about to leave the city. However, there are also homeless wanderers, evicted by their landlords for not being able to pay the rent, spending the night in the waiting room.</p>
<p>Outside the station, countless rickshaws are always arranged vertically and horizontally, regardless of heat or cold, day or night, rain or shine. Each rickshaw puller is craning his neck, hoping to exchange labor for bread. Especially at the moment the train arrives, a trace of a smile will appear on everyone's sallow face.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Reading Paintings, Reading Poems <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Min</p>
<p>Recently, the art wave of the great nation has been surging wildly. In Soviet Russia, Mei Lanfang, the handsome man, and Hu Die, the beautiful woman, along with the star representatives Zhou Jianyun and his wife, will be promoting Chinese drama and film art. In Nanyang, the venerable Zhang Shanzi has been entrusted by the Huang Society, and with his nephews, they will be exhibiting the multi-faceted artistic crystallization of Huangshan photography, poetry, calligraphy, and painting. In order to see it first, I rushed to Zhang's residence, and while they were checking and preparing for packing, I appreciated them piece by piece, roll by roll; at the same time, I quickly recorded several poems inscribed on Zhang's calligraphy and paintings.</p>
<p>Upon returning, I dare not monopolize the beauty, and I serve as a messenger, unconditionally transcribing three poems for everyone. You may wish to imagine yourselves as resurrected ancient poets and recite them aloud. The original poems are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Huang Binhong's inscription: Broken walls and moss shadows dotted with cyan and purple, dug holes a thousand fathoms for guests' toes; looking down at the abyss, clouds are vast, wanting to cross but not crossing, the soul is frightened. Panting and sweating, grasping the cliff, gazing for a while, welcoming the west breeze to open the pale face; how I wish to sit here facing the mountain, spreading the pine green as a pu-cushion. Thoughts gallop endlessly, feet turn forward, experiencing danger and exhausting the secluded to greedily choose the best, the peaks rise from the ground competing for strangeness, allow me to slowly lead the drawing.</p>
<p>(2) Xu Shiying's inscription: I begin to believe that there is such a wonder in the world, Huangshan's years are leisurely; Tiandu and Lotus Peak view the majestic spirit, Yunggu and Lion Grove admire the beautiful posture. Heroes from the four seas now gather, the grand and the minute of a hundred years are exhausted; painting and writing are equally important, hoping to work together for the benefit of the country.</p>

<p>New Modern Tax</p>
<p>Because of the poor local finances, Bulgaria has newly proposed several modern taxes. Generally, a woman is taxed two yuan for each hair perm.

Women who beautify themselves without paying taxes, if they do not carry a tax certificate with them, will be charged double the amount if found. Since the implementation of the new tax law, women across the country are unwilling to beautify themselves. This is a new tax law that is stricter in prohibition than in levy.</p>

<p>Chapter 10 Indecent Lady In Front Show Wealth Selection Greedy Desire Wall Seam Inside Cause Injury Honest</p>
<p>Money, that kind of thing, can solve all the difficult problems in life. Everyone has a number of problems that need to be solved urgently, so you can't help but love money. If that person does not have superhuman reason, he will never be able to get money and not want it. As for those whose reason is not enough, as long as they get money, they can do anything. This cannot be blamed on people, it is forced by everyone's environment. At this time, Zhu Hu was at the end of her rope, even two or three copper coins could buy a piece of bread to fill her stomach, which was of great help to her. Now there are many foreign coins on the table. Zhang Jiefu said that as long as her mind moved, these foreign coins would be hers. After hearing this, she couldn't help but tremble all over and asked: Zhang Lao Ye, you...you...what are you talking about? Zhang Jiefu glanced at Yueying and continued: You are honest people, can I still deceive you with words? If you move your mind, these foreign coins will be yours immediately. Hu looked at the corner of the table and saw that even though the foreign coins were covered with paper, she could still see the white light shining outside. He said, if I move my mind, these foreign coins will be mine immediately. Could it be that he wants me to grab these foreign coins and run away? I can't even walk, how can I run? And this Little Western Paradise is very big. I came in and couldn't even tell east, west, south, or north. How can he let me run out? Thinking so, she supported the table, couldn't help but rise and fall three times, her eyes all shot at the corner of the table. Zhang Jiefu looked at her situation and couldn't understand what he meant, so he said: This sister-in-law, did you hear what I said? If you move your mind, these foreign coins will be yours immediately (148)</p>
<h3 id="e183">Imperial Incense Drifting Record <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Are they all on that side of the car?" She asked Li Lianying.</p>
<p>"They're all on the left, Empress Dowager!" Li replied.</p>
<p>The car was entering the station, and the speed had slowed to the lowest degree. The Empress Dowager slowly walked down from her throne, leaned against the left side of the car window, and faced outside. The rest of the people stayed in place and did not dare to act rashly. At this time, Guangxu was still in his own car; the Empress Dowager specifically told me to stand behind her - this position should have been Guangxu's. Of course, I was very happy to comply, and I was glad that my height was just a little taller than hers, so I could see everything outside clearly over her shoulder. The situation was exactly the same as what we saw when we came: many officials, a large team of soldiers, and the lanterns on the platform, nothing had changed; and Yuan Shikai himself was still kneeling slightly ahead of everyone, showing his identity as the leader. The Empress Dowager smiled slightly as she watched this moving scene slowly shifting in front of her; but the officials were lowering their heads to the ground, respectfully saluting her, so naturally they did not see her smile. Although I was standing behind her shoulder, I could still see it from the corner of her mouth; this smile was indeed extraordinarily gentle and loving, but it could not conceal her fatigue and exhaustion. The image I felt from her smile was indeed very profound and still lingers on my nerves.</p>
<p>Didn't it say in Chapter 14 of this book that Yuan Shikai had a Western orchestra that he brought to Fengtian with the Empress Dowager? At that time, it was said to be a temporary loan, so Qing Shan and his stewards had already thought about it, and they let Wu tell that group of Western orchestra to get off the train in Tianjin.

<p>Intensified Currency War</p>
<p>Gold Prices Plummet</p>
<p>Long Positions Collapse, Forcefully Liquidated in Pain</p>
<p>Astonishing Low Price of 806 Yuan</p>
<p>Resulting in a Miserable Fall to 806.7 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market was in utter chaos yesterday, with a turbulent day of extreme volatility. As the Legislative Yuan is discussing legislation detrimental to the silver standard, the long positions collapsed as expected. Once the selling began, the long positions were exhausted and unable to hold any longer, forcing them to liquidate in pain, leading to a break through major levels and the discovery of an astonishing new low price of 806 yuan. Afterwards, it stabilized slightly. Finally, Sassoon covered short positions, the foreign exchange market tightened, and the rebound was swift. It was noted that initially, overseas silver markets surged across the board, with London spot gold rising sharply by one shilling and nine and a half pence, leading to a further devaluation of the pound and a severe drop in exchange rates. However, it was generally expected that the silver market's rise was too rapid and might retrace, so the gold market might have a chance to rebound. As a result, off-exchange forward transactions opened, although low, not quite enough, initially around 40 yuan, then dropping to 33 or 34 yuan, then rebounding to 38 or 39 yuan. General sentiment saw that market confidence was still good, and buyers were actively engaging, so when the Central Bank announced its rates, although both the British and American rates increased and the customs gold unit fell by 0.2%, it remained stable after opening, once rising to 40 yuan. This stimulated selling, buyers became cautious, and dared not move forward. Market confidence was already timid, and the selling pressure rose again. Traders from South China resumed liquidating and adding to short positions, and banks were struggling to cope, causing the foreign exchange market to harden significantly, breaking through the three major levels of 30, 20, and 10 yuan step by step. Because the selling pressure exceeded all resistance, the remaining long position's strength had reached exhaustion, forcing them to liquidate preemptively. After the new low price was discovered, large short position holders came in to cover slightly, rising past the 10 yuan level, market confidence stabilized slightly, and the situation turned firmer. The after-market opening still appeared hesitant, so the opening price was still low. Then, with the efforts of banks and Sassoon to buy, the domestic market suddenly tightened, and Chinese merchants also covered positions, so it gradually rose past the 20 yuan level. The foreign exchange market was surprisingly tight, the market situation was contrarily brisk, and there was a great sense of a rebound and recovery. However, the Dalian gang and others took advantage of the high prices to sell, halting the rising trend. Market confidence was originally hesitant, allowing sellers to seize the opportunity to act, gradually retreating into the 20 yuan range. The closing price was still considered stable. It was noted that trading was quite active throughout the day, and the downward trend was too strong, so the trend might shift slightly, but it is also unknown.

Therefore, the deposit interest rate was set at the above amount, it is said.</p>

<p>Bond Market Virtually Stalled</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market situation grew increasingly stagnant from maneuvering. Trading was becoming increasingly reduced, and the atmosphere among the various groups was unusually idle. The occasional buying and selling was also dispensable. The big players had no transactions at all. Only the 23 Customs forward contracts saw a lot of selling, but due to the limited price range, it failed to cause any fluctuation. If there is no new development in the environment, new transactions will not easily join. Therefore, the market situation's future still cannot break free from maneuvering and waiting, and there is fear that there will still be a period of mutual firm rejection. Yesterday's events, in general, still failed to break free from maneuvering, and became increasingly stagnant. In each session, besides a few that failed to open, there were bound to be several whose market prices had no progress. Even if there were fluctuations, they could not jump out of the range of 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The dull situation made people tired. Throughout the day, only the 23 Customs forward contracts saw a lot of selling due to contract number 53, but because the price limit was very strict, the result was also a lack of both honor and disgrace. In summary, market prices resulted in the current month's 19 Reorganization issue being slightly better by 0.05, and the rest were better by 0.05 to 0.1 to 0.15 yuan. Gold short term rose by the largest amount at .25 yuan, while Zheng 6 rose by .3 yuan. The total number of transactions totaled 6,361,000 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Appear to Be Recovering</p>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, but local market confidence showed a turning point, because it had been falling for many days, and recently spot yarn sales were still smooth and healthy, and there were also long position company organizations, so most people's sentiment saw a possibility of recovery. However, the international currency war is exceptionally fierce, which is very unfavorable to our country's commodity prices.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Recovered 0.3 to 0.4 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, although the news from the gold market was unfavorable, there was a lack of new sellers in the market, and market prices were contrarily seen as tight and expensive. In fact, there were long position company organizations pulling tightly and never letting go. However, Da Ji numbers continued to short sell. Unexpectedly, around the three o'clock closing, news spread that gold prices had an astonishing fall, and market confidence was slightly panicked and fell. As a result, all months fell by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 yuan. The afternoon opening market situation was slightly stable. However, around the two to three o'clock session, news spread that gold prices had rebounded, and market sentiment was excitedly rising back up. At the same time, there were 2,000 bales of spot yarn transactions, and all months rose by 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 yuan. However, with the foreign exchange rate continuously rising, foreign yarn must be combined with the national currency at around 156 yuan, only creating opportunities for foreign yarn. The sellers were found to be Da Ji 1,900 bales, Tong Ji 600 bales, Qingfeng 550 bales, Rui Da 1,350 bales, Changfeng 2,800 bales, Jinchang 500 bales, Yuan Yi 550 bales, Yong Da 500 bales, Chong An 500 bales. The buyers were He Xing 1,450 bales, Ming De 750 bales, Jun Chang 1,100 bales, Shengyuan 800 bales, Chang Yu 550 bales, Run Kang 550 bales, Xie Cheng 600 bales, Xin Cheng 600 bales, and De Ji 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Weak at 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that various groups bought a total of 1,985 bales throughout the day. The market situation was calm. The buying amounts for various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo 20</p>
<p>Guangdong 180</p>
<p>Changsha 110 Yunnan 260</p>
<p>Jiangxi 60</p>
<p>Same Trade 10</p>
<p>Inland 275 Shantou 10</p>
<p>Tianjin 100 Henan 450</p>
<p>Sichuan 500 Luzhou 15</p>
<p>The cotton market changed three times, and the situation showed a slight increase. Long positions expect a rebound, seeking the opinions of various parties, because it has been falling for a long time. It was found that a portion of the short positions in the market have already flipped to long positions. However, the gold market has a straight-line downward trend, and the foreign exchange rate is rising wildly. The calculated price of foreign cotton is getting closer every day. The spot price of American cotton is 35.33 yuan per dan, a decrease of 1.01 yuan compared to the previous day, so foreign merchants are inclined to sell.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Varies Greatly</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, American cotton fell slightly by two to three points, but Indian cotton rose by 2.3 rupees. However, gold prices opened down by over 10 yuan, but the market saw an increase, because long positions purchased and added to their positions. At the same time, most people's sentiment saw a 1 yuan recovery, so the market situation showed a significant reactionary phenomenon. Unexpectedly, around the three o'clock closing, news spread that gold prices had fallen miserably, breaking through the 810 yuan level, and the market situation suddenly became weak. Floating long positions were liquidated, and new low prices were discovered for each month, falling by 0.15 to 0.25 yuan. The afternoon opening was still calm and weak, and around the two to three o'clock session, news spread that the gold market had rebounded by over 20 yuan, and closing market sentiment was still increasing. As a result, each month rose by 0.15 to 0.2 and 0.3 yuan. The sellers were found to be Jifeng 10,400 dan, Changhe 8,400 dan, Changfeng 4,000 dan, Yongda 1,800 dan, Xincheng 1,300 dan, Gengfeng 3,000 dan, Lianji 1,900 dan, and Yuanda 1,500 dan. The buyers were Shengyuan 3,200 dan, Dafu 1,700 dan, Dafeng 2,900 dan, Dafu 1,400 dan, Shen Yu 2,900 dan, Run Kang 9,500 dan, Yi Chang 4,500 dan, Gengfeng 1,600 dan, and Yi Kang 2,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Manufacturers Still Have Little Appetite</p>

<p>Flour Continues to Weaken and Fall</p>
<p>Afternoon Because the Return of Certificates Did Not Open</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, the market situation for each month presented a weakening and falling trend. Because foreign wheat had no quotations, from the perspective of the domestic situation, there was little reason for a heavy fall. However, the infighting of international currencies has made commodity prices unpredictable. When the market opened in the morning, because gold prices fell miserably again and again, it was close to the 800 yuan level, so the opening price for the current month was as low as 0.29 yuan, and the forward months fell by 0.02 yuan and 0.01 yuan respectively. In the second session, the current month stabilized slightly due to short covering, but forward months continued to weaken and fall. After the exchange rate rose sharply, the calculated price of foreign wheat became increasingly loose and cheap. It was heard that A wheat had weakened to between 4.035 yuan, and the market atmosphere's inability to recover seemed to be unpermitted by the international environment.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Urbanites' Worries and Joys <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>In these times, those who can truly "find joy in forgetting worries" are rare. Those who can are mostly people without "worries," or whose "worries" are not real worries. In the New Year, "we have merchants slaughtering livestock to welcome the God of Wealth; scholars gathering elegantly to celebrate the festival; heroes watching women set off firecrackers; onlookers standing by the roadside, clapping and cheering," as well as young gentlemen from wealthy families who frequent the dog racing track to bet on single winners and dance the Charleston at the Paramount. Do they really have any "worries"? Perhaps the troubles of jealousy in love, but these trivial "worries" can indeed be forgotten with "joy." If we were to blame them for forgetting the "national crisis" and for "forgetting the pain once the wound has healed"—especially since the wound hasn't actually healed yet—it would still be "alienating" them. Some of them still consider themselves "not lagging behind," because they actually do wear some "domestic goods." Besides, in reality, there isn't really any "wound" now.</p>
<p>"Finding a bit of happiness in forgetting the pain amidst suffering" can only be done by those who believe their suffering isn't that great, or those who have none at all, yet put on a face as if they are suffering. They have no suffering, or "their suffering" is minimal. After visiting the dog racing track once or twice, embracing a dancer, and being driven home in a car at three in the morning, they climb into bed and can forget everything by the next morning.</p>
<p>In the city, the silent weeping of those who have gone bankrupt and the forced smiles of those who are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, fearing that others will see their weaknesses, are indeed drowned out by the gentle singing of "Peach Blossom River, My Darling I Love You" on the radio and the boisterous laughter of the successful. As for the countryside, not only is there no Lantern Festival, there isn't even a "New Year." "Worries" exist, and they cannot be forgotten with "joy." Even if there is some "joy," it cannot stir up any happiness. Moreover, there isn't even "joy" enough to forget worries!</p>
<p>During the Lantern Festival, who has ever seen a beggar dancing the Charleston in an alleyway? Using "medicine to forget worries"? I have only seen "beggars" who have fled from bankrupt Jiangbei villages to this prosperous city, staring at elegant young women—but not to set off firecrackers, but to ask for a few coppers, only to receive a frown and a few cries of "unjust death"!</p>
<p>It is clear that those who "find joy in forgetting worries" are few and far between, and not something everyone can accomplish.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Again, "Essays" <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xijun</p>
<p>In reply to Mr. Tang Tao</p>
<p>Previously, I unintentionally wrote an essay titled "Essays and Essayists" (published in the "Literary Soliloquy" section of Modern Magazine in September of last year), expressing my humble opinion on this phenomenon—it was just a humble opinion, and I dared not presume it to be a profound theory. Unexpectedly, it stirred up public outrage, and I was attacked with both direct and indirect methods. I had not anticipated that my words would touch people's sore spots. The tense reactions of people were not without reason, and since I didn't have an organization to back me up, like "two people forming a faction, three people forming a clique," I could only let the "brave soldiers" stand alone and remain silent.</p>
<p>I thought I could finally have peace, but the flames of the "heroes" continued to spread, seemingly burning endlessly. During a forum in a certain major magazine, they seemed unable to forget this "hatred," continuously firing cold arrows at me.</p>
<p>Now I have to say something.</p>
<p>I had occasionally read an article by Mr. Tang Tao in Reading Life, titled "Essays and Cooks," which also used the cold arrow tactics commonly used by "heroes," firing several "poison arrows" at me. Now, in Free Talk, I see Mr. Tang Tao's "Talking About Essays." Mr. Tang Tao's repeated defense of essays suggests he is undoubtedly a "long live essays" advocate.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Tang Tao this time did not fully understand the original intention of my humble article "More and Less" in the recent Literary Pictorial, but only extracted fragments to use as ammunition for attack. I cannot agree with this attitude.</p>
<p>In my previous two short articles, I repeatedly said that "the essays currently popular touch on a wide range of topics, almost encompassing various social issues of current affairs, international affairs, and politics, almost no different from the commentary articles in newspapers." And as Mr. Tang Tao said, "essays are indeed not like novels, poems, or dramas." At the same time, they are no different from other non-literary works, such as various academic papers and narratives. It is impossible to force any "slight" literary nature onto them. But here I want to solemnly state that I am definitely not a formalist mechanist, and I never said that articles other than literary works such as novels or dramas are not needed. If they are not wasteful, they still have another aspect of meaning and effect. (Such as papers on politics, economics, and other categories.) This is like the prejudice expressed in the "forum" of a certain major magazine that "essays have taken on a particularly important responsibility in the past year," singling out essays as if the entire literary scene in the past year had nothing worth recording except for essays (in fact, essays cannot be considered literary works and regarded as the harvest of the literary scene). Isn't this obviously distorting the facts and having ulterior motives? It is true that "essays" have mysteriously flourished in the past year, but very few of them are well-written (if they have any value at all). If there are so-called well-written ones, I think they are probably just good at personal attacks. I don't believe there's anything great about that. Now that the call for great works is extremely loud, some people optimistically tell us that "it (referring to essays) is the era of quiet cultivation for the arrival of great works in the near future." Fortunately, "the near future" will "arrive," and we might as well be optimistic with the prophets and wait for the arrival of this great work in the near future. However, I always suspect that it is a kind of unlimited blank check.</p>
<p>I don't have the authority to stop "essayists" from burying themselves in the "era of quiet cultivation for the near future" for the work of "great works" that is "better" than everything else, nor do I have the great ability to extinguish these "very necessary" "essays." Mr. Tang Tao doesn't have to worry too much. Future events are difficult to predict, so let's wait and see.</p>

<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>The early spring in Macau is so warm. The slight breeze caresses the hearts of travelers. The air is filled with a Western flavor! On the high, refreshing hills, beautiful houses are arranged, standing one by one on the sloping cement roads. In the spaces between the lush evergreen trees, one can vaguely see the red and green tiled roofs. Quietly, distantly, some small birds that are not afraid of the cold chirp, stirring my emotions:</p>
<p>Beautiful and lovely spring has arrived.</p>
<p>The market in Macau is always in a frenzy.</p>
<p>On the shore of the surging South Sea, the streets and alleys are filled with arrogant sounds. In the dimly lit gambling dens, countless people want to bury their dazed minds in the depths of white silver and colorful banknotes. When they reach the point where survival is impossible, they throw their lives into the raging waves, quietly. Then, batch after batch of gamblers with great desires squeeze in, struggling in the twisted circle of life from day to night, from spring to winter, endlessly.</p>
<p>There, although there is a deep sense of human sorrow, most people are reveling. The bare-chested, bare-armed courtesans have captivating bodies. They bewitch the young and the lovelorn who have been squeezed out of the circle of life. When the demon of money cruelly whips them, they put on a bitter smile, perhaps with a sorrowful sympathy, and send them into the emerald green waves. However, groups of men are then drawn into that fragrant environment. When they are plundered by the whips of life and can no longer survive, then a group of village girls quickly arrive, eternally sinking in the tragic march of revelry!</p>
<p>There are countless skeletons, forever buried in dark rooms, sucking the marrow of man-eating opium. There are high-ceilinged dance halls where people of authority dance until dawn, holding the slender waists of charming women.</p>
<p>But alas! City of sin! It is only a gathering place for disheartened wealthy people! Forever rolling and tumbling, one day it will be buried by the roaring seawater.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Talking About My Own Paintings <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zikai</p>
<p>"Colored Zikai New Year Cartoons"</p>
<p>The Kai Ming Bookstore's "Middle School Student Magazine" included a color print of my vertical painting on Chinese paper, called "Colored Zikai New Year Cartoons," as a supplement to its January issue this year. When I saw this title on the advertisement, I found it funny because I was squeezed between two adjectives and placed on top of a noun, which felt a bit unnatural.</p>
<p>However, I dare not blame the unnaturalness of the title. Because my painting is more unnatural than the title. This vertical painting is simply wrong!</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of middle school student readers probably did not notice the mistakes in my painting. Otherwise, why have there only been letters in the past month or two asking me for paintings on rice paper, and no letters pointing out the errors in this vertical painting? Also, why would someone be willing to mount this painting, so that this erroneous painting would be displayed high on the walls of framing shops? But perhaps not: perhaps someone has already seen the mistakes in this vertical painting and is discussing them. However, they disdain, are unwilling, or find it inconvenient to announce them in writing to embarrass me.</p>
<p>But it seems I don't need a platform. I'm dismantling it myself here: This vertical painting is wrong; at least, it is very clumsily drawn. Let me confess:</p>
<p>Where is the mistake in the painting? Please look at the painting: In the foreground is the shore, and on the shore is a tall pine tree. In the background is also the shore, and half of a rising sun is emerging from the horizon, emitting light and driving away the clouds above. In the midground is a small boat, close to this shore, heading towards the rising sun on the other shore. The mistake is in this place. Please look at the boat: there are four people in total, two young men wearing Boy Scout uniforms, one sitting at the bow and one sitting at the stern. There are also two young women, sitting together in the cabin. They are all facing the rising sun, with their backs to the viewer; they are all rowing. The person at the stern is holding the middle of the oar with his right hand and the end of the handle with his left hand, using the oar as a rudder. The other three oars are all tied to the side of the boat in the middle. The three of them are holding the ends of the handles with both hands and pushing and pulling up and down. A friend told me, "You drew it wrong! These three are all rowing backwards, and the boat cannot reach the bright shore. Instead, it is retreating"! That's right, these three oars use the principle of leverage. The point where it is tied to the side of the boat is the fulcrum. The end of the handle is the force point. The oar blade in the water is the weight point. Pushing the oar blade into the water and pulling the handle, the boat will naturally move backwards, retreating and crashing onto this shore. This is a very big mistake.</p>
<p>However, I can argue: These three are all "pushing the oars," not "rowing the oars." When pushing the oar, when the oar blade enters the water, push the oar handle forward, and when it comes out of the water, pull it backward. The boat will also move forward. Pictures cannot show past and future actions like movies. How do you know that the young man leaning forward at the bow is not just finishing a push and is about to start pulling in an oar? How do you know that the two young women leaning back in the cabin are not just starting to push the oars and just finishing pulling in an oar?</p>
<p>My friend smiled and told me: "Your hands hold a pen all year round, and you have never held an oar. You don't know the joys and sorrows of this. This strong argument is clearly useless. Do you know that pushing the oar is very laborious and slow, and when pulling it in, the oar blade comes out of the water and is in the air, light and floating? If the body doesn't use force, it is easy to fall backwards. Smart boatmen would never use this method. Even if your words are correct, the young men and women in this boat are all clumsy people who "put in effort but get no results." I tell you, you should teach them to "turn around," facing the viewer and with their backs to the light. In this way, they can save effort, reach the destination quickly, and use smiling faces to please the viewer. Wouldn't that kill three birds with one stone!"</p>
<p>When I heard these words, I suddenly realized. The next day, I ran to the lake early in the morning, hired a boat, turned the bow towards the rising sun, and personally practiced this pushing the oars. Indeed, I felt it was very laborious, very slow, and if I didn't use force, it was very easy to fall over. Moreover, I was laughed at by the boatman, who advised me: "Sir, turn around and put your butt towards the sunlight. It's much more comfortable!" I once listened to his advice, but immediately turned around again, willing to put in effort but get no results. Because after being comfortable, I discovered a big flaw: I could no longer see the sun and turned my back on the light. There are no eyes on the buttocks, and my heart is always anxious, not knowing if my boat is heading straight on the path of light? Therefore, I would rather put in more effort, be slower, use more strength, and still take my rowing method. Let others laugh at my clumsiness. As long as I can face the light and move forward, my heart will be at peace. At this time, I realized two philosophical principles of rowing towards the rising sun: If you want to save effort, want to achieve it quickly, want to be comfortable, and want not to be laughed at, you must turn your back on the light. If you want to face the light, you have to put in a little more effort, be a little slower, use a little strength, and be laughed at a few more times.</p>
<p>Ah! This vertical painting of mine is wrong! I am sorry to the printers and the bookstore, who had to spend a lot of money to print and distribute it, but that is secondary. First of all, I am sorry to the readers: the painting clearly states "Made for middle school student readers on the first day of the twenty-fourth year," as if it is advising young people to put in effort, be slow, use strength, and be laughed at on New Year's Day, which is a time to wish for prosperity. This is such a big mistake! Because in the current world, practicality comes first, and everyone tries their best to save effort, achieve quickly, and be comfortable. Who would be willing to put in effort for some unattainable light and do things that don't pay off?</p>
<p>When this vertical painting was not yet printed, a well-meaning friend pointed out the factual errors in this painting. But I stubbornly refused to listen and published the painting. "Once a word is spoken, it is hard to undo." Moreover, tens of thousands of "Colored Zikai New Year Cartoons" have been delivered by postmen to the desks of tens of thousands of readers, and I don't even have a nag, how can I get them back? Let me be wrong to the end, clumsy to the end. Not only do I confess my mistakes and clumsiness here, but I also post an advertisement here to start selling my kind of wrong and clumsy paintings. This article can also be said to be an advertisement for the advertisement.</p>

<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>"Haha!" Li An couldn't help but laugh at this statement, yet immediately, for some unknown reason, a wave of bitterness welled up in his heart. He threw the empty glass on the table and staggered to his feet, only to collapse back onto the sofa. "You little witch, you dare to be coy with me! I don't care about you! I!" As he spoke, white froth bubbled from his mouth, and he drifted back to sleep, snoring loudly.</p>
<p>"Loss of vitality! Loss of vitality," the New Literary Man muttered to himself, "This is a loss of national vitality. The Japanese would never get this drunk, unless it's the Cherry Blossom Festival! When I was in Japan!"</p>
<p>"Heh! Heh! What about me!" The big-bellied man's pumpkin face, resembling a smaller globe on a larger globe, was spinning now as well. "I also want! Hey, another drink. If this drink gets spilled too, then we're done for. Yi Yuan, have you calculated yet, how much profit we can get from this lottery, net of printing costs? As the saying goes, horses won't get fat without pasture, and people won't get rich without unexpected wealth. Nowadays, it's a dream to make money from legitimate businesses. Yi Yuan, what do you think? Speaking of my profession, people don't even have enough to eat, so who's wearing silver rings and using silver ear picks? When daughters get married, it's a giveaway; twenty years old, twenty dollars; hoping someone will foot the bill! So, in these times, I, as a division commander, have no taste for it anymore. You can forget about being promoted to army commander!"</p>
<p>Holding onto the table, he stood up, the table rocking from side to side, the dishes clattering. The big-bellied man retreated to the bed, sprawling out on his back, his belly sticking out.</p>
<p>The Sofa Walker, in his drunken dream, took the sound of the dishes to be some kind of music, waving his hand in revulsion, striking a Rodin-esque pose. "Good, good, dear girl! Do a waltz! I'll play the violin. Heh; heh! Zzzzzz..." He turned over and couldn't help but vomit.</p>
<p>"Joke! Joke!" Hu Yiyuan finally put down his chopsticks and stood up. "Can't handle it like that! Although I, Hu Yiyuan, am young, I've been through storms." Saying this, he pulled up the long sleeves of his short jacket to his shoulders.</p>
<p>The New Literary Man was quite moved. He seized the opportunity to add a critique: "Too pointless, too pointless!"</p>
<p>"But—I still want a melody of 'Flute at Yellow Crane Tower, Plum Blossoms Falling in the Fifth Month of Jiangcheng.' Don't think it's pointless! Heh..." Smiling, Hu Yiyuan squeezed into the bed.</p>
<p>Before the sound of smoking could be heard, Guo Ren was concentrating on an article on the prohibition of alcohol to save the nation. Suddenly, a flurry of footsteps arose outside the door—the sounds of leather shoes, cloth shoes, girls' laughter, and men's fake scolding—then the door creaked open again.</p>
<p>"Hu Yiyuan! Hu Yiyuan!"</p>
<p>"Young Master Hu! Young Master Hu!"</p>
<p>A man's voice that had been smoothed of its sharp edges and a woman's voice that scratched the nerves like a saw also came out at the same time as the opening of the door. Door.</p>
<p>A middle-aged captive in a gray suit was ushered in by a group of women soldiers—the faces of those women soldiers were all smeared with red, like overripe peaches.</p>
<p>The New Literary Man immediately darkened his face, retreating to the corner of the room at the same time.</p>
<p>"Ugh! Red terror! Red terror!" He muttered again to himself in a low voice.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Gandhi Opposes Old Man Marrying <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from the previous day stated that an old, wealthy Indian man in Mumbai, sixty years of age, will soon marry a thirteen-year-old girl. Mahatma Gandhi specifically telegraphed the National Congress to protest this matter, saying that it is inappropriate for an underage girl to marry an old man in his sixties. Gandhi also ordered his followers to find ways to resist this. Gandhi is truly a meddler, a master of pranks.</p>
<p>Indian women mature early by nature, and it is not uncommon for a thirteen-year-old to be a mother. Moreover, the old man is wealthy, so the girl is naturally willing to marry him. Even in terms of the law, it is legally permissible for a withered willow to bloom. Why should Gandhi bother to interfere in their happy event? It's like stirring up a pond of spring water, none of his business.</p>
<p>Even from the girl's point of view, it is not a bad move. A man can remarry after his wife dies, and a woman can naturally remarry after her husband dies. Although the laws of India have not been investigated, it is assumed that they are no different. Since this is the case, if the old man dies, the woman can remarry. Even if she doesn't want to marry, she will still have plenty of money and be a wealthy woman. She has a legitimate path to take, and there are many other flexible solutions, which need not be mentioned.</p>
<p>Gandhi is truly not a content and self-disciplined fellow, insisting on interfering and telegraphing the National Congress to express his protest. Not only that, but he also ordered his followers to find ways to resist, so that the white-haired and red-faced can consummate a good relationship. What is the reason for this? In 1931, a similar incident occurred. On the day of the wedding, Gandhi's followers organized a funeral procession, sending them off along the way and mocking them. Now, Gandhi's followers know that the old story will be repeated, and it remains to be seen whether they will come up with new tricks.</p>
<p>However, there are many extremely inhumane and unreasonable things in the world, which the law often cannot prohibit. In such cases, it is only possible to deal with them using extraordinary means. Gandhi is in a colony under the British Empire and cannot resist, so he can only promote non-resistance and non-cooperation as a way to deal with it. The imperialists have no way to control him. Now Gandhi is also using this method to interfere in the old man's marriage, which is truly the same technique.</p>
<p>I recall that during the Qing Dynasty, only those with rank could wear a full red cloak. A certain prefect, upon arriving at his post, saw that many members of the gentry in the area were wearing full red hats. However, these people were mostly members of the gentry, and he didn't want to seriously challenge them and order a ban, because the gentry class during the Qing Dynasty had a special kind of power that was not to be easily offended. This power still exists to a considerable extent today. The prefect came up with a plan and made hundreds of full red hats, distributing them to beggars, and the trend disappeared.</p>
<p>It can be seen that everyone knows how to perform magic tricks, and each has their own different skills. The world is full of unreasonable things, and there are unreasonable ways to deal with them. When the law loses its effectiveness, there are special methods to remedy it.</p>

<p>— Xiao Hong</p>
<p>Friend, didn’t you say, “Although the environment makes you like this, you must take care of your health?” How are you now? A page full of gray, a page full of distress.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, my environment is much worse than yours, and my distress is heavier than yours, but I would rather deeply dam it in my heart. I will overcome it with the greatest strength. If a glimmer of hope hangs before me, I will grasp it with tears in my eyes and embrace my incomplete heart to march toward this hope. Although I have been severely hit many times, even this glimmer of hope cannot be realized.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I also have the same thoughts as you, like "How to be a person" and "What is life", but I often jokingly say, "It is for the lover's charming smile," "It is for the lover's..." and think it through.</p>
<p>Although, it’s a pity, I still don’t have a lover, but when I am distressed, I still often use this almost joking thought to heal my wounds and to encourage my remaining courage after failure.</p>
<p>Really, until now, on the one hand, I enjoy myself to the fullest, and on the other hand, I encourage myself even more. At least, I think, in this world, I still have myself who loves me, I am still young, and I still have things to do. Why should I be depressed? Why should I be depressed!</p>
<p>When friends see me enjoying myself to the fullest, they all say that I have changed. One friend even kindly said to another friend: "X, be careful of Xiao Hong's suicide. Look how badly he has changed."</p>
<p>When my friend told me this, I couldn't help but thank my friend for his kindness. At the same time, I felt greatly insulted. That friend who deserves my thanks underestimated me too much. He thought that after a few failures in the trenches of life, I would commit suicide behind people’s backs. He was even worried because he saw me enjoying myself to the fullest recently. Friend, I will not commit suicide. I may kill someone, or I may be killed, but I will never end my own life with my own hands.</p>
<p>If you say that my enjoying myself to the fullest is practicing "chronic suicide," then I want to ask: When suffering constant blows, isn’t a person allowed to use entertainment to relieve temporary pain? Isn’t a person allowed to use entertainment as a marching song for their career? If not, please seal the mouths of manual laborers. Aren't they humming "Hang yo! Hang yo!" when they work?</p>
<p>You said that your friends have become indifferent to you, and that you still regret that you have lost the love of many friends in exchange for one person’s soul. You seem to feel the narrowness and pain of this world.</p>
<p>Friends are indifferent to you, perhaps it is your overthinking, but perhaps it is true. However, why should friends be indifferent to you? Are they disappointed because you gained a soul? It is truly something to congratulate yourself on when such friends leave. Why feel depressed again? As for other friends who seem to be estranged, you also feel the sadness of being separated from the group. In fact, haven’t you already said, "The closeness of friends is not built on the closeness of interaction?"</p>
<p>Friend, don't be so sickly sentimental. Comfort yourself. Find something to relieve your distress. In this era, in this world, who among us doesn’t have a belly full of distress?</p>
<p>Besides, you still have a "soul" that you have obtained. Take a step back and think, what if you lost even this "soul"? There are many people in this world who live empty and hollow!</p>
<p>Friend, think about yourself tomorrow and throw away those sorrows like you would discard a cigarette butt.</p>

<h3 id="e197">My Father Disappoints Me Too Much <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I now have a difficult problem to solve, and I would like to ask you to guide me to a solution.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I graduated from senior primary school. At that time, I wanted to continue my studies, but my family did not allow me to enter middle school. They wanted to send me to a certain store to be an apprentice to lighten the family’s burden. At that time, for the sake of lifelong happiness, I tried my best to resist, but I had to go to that store because of my father's orders and live that life like a beast of burden.</p>
<p>Now, although I am an apprentice, my enthusiasm for studying has not changed. I very much hope to achieve my desire. So I often beg my family to restore my study life. However, the result is always disappointment! At the same time, my father is very dissatisfied with me because I resisted his opinion and did not listen to him. That stern attitude is really unbearable. Under such circumstances, I developed a bad ideal: I want to break away from the shackles of the family and live independently. First, I think that the reason why I cannot study is entirely due to the oppression of the family. If there is no family to stop me, I may be able to achieve the goal of studying. At the same time, my father's attitude has disappointed me too much.</p>
<p>However, although I have this ideal, I do not have the power to implement it, and how can I leave my kind grandmother and mother? Therefore, I thought about it again and again, and it was really difficult. Dear Sir! How can I fulfill my ambition to study? How can I break away from my family without suffering? Please guide me! Respectfully, Wang Shaogao</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In this year of economic panic, the lives of ordinary people have serious problems. Who has extra money to provide for their children's studies? Therefore, Mr. Wang should first carefully observe whether the family has the ability to continue to provide tuition. If you are prevented from entering school due to economic difficulties, then you must forgive them, because you must never let them starve to death for the sake of your personal studies.</p>
<p>Now you cannot achieve your desire to study, and because of your father's stern attitude, you want to break away from your family. This is a very wrong mentality. May I ask you: After you break away from your family, do you have the ability to study? Can you support yourself now?</p>
<p>As for the reason why your father treats you badly, it is probably because you resisted his opinion. But we think that after his anger subsides, he will still love you. At that time, if you explain the reasons again and beg him to let you study, you may be able to achieve your goal. Because only parents in the world can best forgive their children. Moreover, although your father is now very strict, you still have a kind grandmother and mother. They must be very kind to you. You must not lose your loving family because of temporary indignation!</p>
<p>Regarding the point of studying, we believe that while serving, you are also studying. All practical experience is your knowledge. You can use your spare time to work hard on self-study, and you will definitely make progress over time. Therefore, we advise you not to feel pain and disappointment because you cannot study at school.</p>

<p>Leisurely stroll to play in the spring suburbs. The scenery of the suburbs is worth looking at carefully. I saw the willow shade covering the willow bank. On the bank, I saw the red peach. The peach flips the brocade waves and the smoke confuses the willow. The willow reflects the peach cheeks and the flowers are more delicate. The delicate birds fly to sing the ancient trees. The sound of wine faintly lingers in the forest. The horses are sitting leisurely. The horses are whipping over the small bridge. Under the bridge, the fishermen sell wine and drink. Drinking the fragrant wine is a pleasure. Looking at the bamboo forest, the layers are stacked with green. The green pine and cypress pull up to the sky. The high and low mountain scenery is like a picture. The painting pavilion beauties play the xiao. The xiao rhyme is long and the sky is late. The evening wind sends the temple bell ringing. The bell rings break and the people are quiet. The day is quiet and the birds return to their nests. The nests are black and small and the spring branches are full. The eyes are full of spring light and it is difficult to describe. It is difficult to describe the infinite beauty of the spring. The good scenery must always be carefully looked at. You can see the willow waves and the oriole sound is fine. The broken brocade sails are rocking the oars. Shake to Yue Fei's loyal tomb. The green grass beside the tomb is too strange. The strange thing is that the traitor looks. Like the knees are bent and facing the dynasty. Zhao Na Yue Wang complained about the treacherous plan of design. Indescribable the bad intentions of the year are rampant. Rampantly throw away the tears in the end.</p>

<p>Duke Zhuang of Zheng Conquers Duan in Yan (Part 2)</p>
<p>Duke Zhuang's plans were not yet over. In the eleventh year of Duke Yin of Lu, Duke Zhuang enfeoffed Xu to his uncle, saying, "I have a brother who cannot live in harmony, and I let him make a living in the four directions. How can he possess Xu for long?" This statement was Duke Zhuang's intention to deceive the world. In the sixteenth year of Duke Zhuang of Lu, Zheng Gongfu, Ding Shu, fled to Wei, and after three years he was restored, saying, "I cannot let Gongshu have no descendants in Zheng." Then Gongshu has descendants in the old Zheng. Duan has descendants, which is Duke Zhuang's intention to deceive later generations. He deceived his court, his state, the world, and later generations. Alas, alas, precarious and dangerous is Duke Zhuang's heart.</p>
<p>To deceive others, one must first deceive one's own heart. Duke Zhuang was only pleased that many people were deceived by him, but he did not know that he deceived his own heart more. The harm of being deceived is harm to the body. The harm of deceiving others is harm to the heart. There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and the death of the body is second. Those who are deceived, although their bodies are harmed, their hearts are still at ease. Those who deceive others, although their bodies achieve their goals, their hearts have been hewn and lost without a trace. What is lost by the former is very light, and what is lost by the latter is very heavy. It is like a fisherman swallowing the bait himself, or a hunter throwing himself into a trap. If not for the most clumsy person in the world, how could one reach this point? Therefore, I initially thought Duke Zhuang was the most dangerous person in the world, but I finally thought Duke Zhuang was the most clumsy person in the world.</p>

(The plate is the bath plate. The inscription is to name the vessel with words to warn oneself. Gou means sincerity. Tang uses people's washing their hearts to remove evil, just like bathing their bodies to remove dirt, so he inscribed his plate, saying that if one can sincerely use one day to cleanse the dirt of the old dyeing and renovate oneself, then one should rely on the already new person, and renovate oneself every day, and again, renovate oneself every day, and one must not have any interruptions.) The Kang Gao says, "Create new people." (Gu means dancing and encouraging. It means to revive the self-renovating people.) The poem says, "Zhou, although an old state, its mandate is new." (The poem is a chapter of the Great Elegant Wen Wang, saying that although the Zhou state is old, as for King Wen, he can renew his virtue and extend it to the people and begin to receive the mandate of heaven.)</p>

<p>— Translated by Chen Hongduo</p>
<p>(1) Manufacturing Method of Hollow Concrete Piles</p>
<p>When building a bridge, the Missouri Pacific Railroad in the United States adopted a new method to manufacture steel-reinforced concrete piles to reduce their weight and obtain greater pile surface friction at the same weight. The cross-section of the pile is octagonal, with a diameter of 24 hours and a hollow diameter of 10 inches. One pile is 36 feet long and has a hollow throughout its length. The opening at the tip is flattened. Another pile has a solid tip, and the straight trunk is hollow, extending to the top of the pile.</p>
<p>When the pile was driven into the last foot, although there were 150 hammer blows, the pile head was not damaged. According to the pile driving records, after a pile was driven in, the soil squeezed into the hollow interior for 14 feet and 8 inches. Before the pile reached the hard stratum, the hammering was much easier than that of a solid concrete pile.</p>
<p>The hollow is made with a retractable rubber tube that expands to the specified diameter by gas or hydraulic power while reducing its length. After the concrete hardens, the rubber tube is pulled out.</p>
<p>(2) New Hollow Roof Concrete Blocks</p>
<p>These blocks are made of asbestos cement, 6 feet long and 2 feet 6 inches wide, and are used for flat roofs or roofs with very small slopes. The blocks are hollow, so they can prevent the transmission of heat and sound. They are not heavy and can be transported by two people.</p>
<p>After the blocks are placed, the horizontal seams are connected to each other, and the vertical seams are filled with cement slurry. If the blocks are placed on trusses, they can also be used as a working platform. Before the oil felt or asphalt is laid on the blocks, a covering roof has been formed, which is enough to prevent rainwater from penetrating, making other work easier and more convenient.</p>
<p>(3) New Fireproof Concrete Floor</p>
<p>This new type of fireproof concrete floor is known for its rapid construction and simple arch frame. Its structure is hollow, with one side closed. When installed, the hollow openings are connected to form 18-inch square blocks, like a sealed box, with a thickness ranging from 4.5 inches to 9 inches. The lower flange of the two parallel sides extends slightly beyond itself. During installation, the flanges of the two blocks are connected, and straight steel bars are placed in the resulting gap. The lower flange of the closed end is also connected in the same way to place horizontal steel bars. These concrete blocks are mostly manufactured on-site.</p>
<p>The arch frame is welded with No. 16 steel plate, and its middle section is triangular, with three sizes to suit different spans. Transportation, installation and dismantling are very convenient. The web of the arch frame is cut off at the end, and the flange retains a 2-inch long and 7.5-inch wide support area to transmit the load to the brick wall or other supports. Each end of the arch frame is left with an empty eye so that a tool can be inserted to pull back its extended part. If the floor is completed, the arch frame can be dismantled.</p>
<p>The special convenience of this arch frame is that it does not require support in the middle, so there is no obstruction under the floor and other work can be carried out.</p>
<p>The center distance of the arch frame is 18 inches. Because of its simplicity, a hundred square yards of floor area can be installed in one sentence. Then, hollow concrete blocks are placed, and horizontal and vertical steel bars are added to the resulting gap, and fine concrete is poured to become ribs. If necessary, another layer of concrete is added on top. After four days, the arch frame can be dismantled according to the aforementioned method. After the blocks are laid, it becomes a working platform, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Both sides of the board are equipped with steel bars, so the load distribution area is larger and the safety factor is higher. According to the test results, the deflection in the center of a 15-foot span is only one-twentieth of an inch for a floor designed with a load of 100 pounds per square foot, with a weight of 5 tons concentrated in an area of 4 square feet. After the load is removed, the board returns to its original shape. Furthermore, the use of bidirectional steel bars and fewer cracks in the flat top make it more suitable. This type of concrete block does not deform like hollow bricks and is easy to apply mud and whitewash.</p>
<p>The thickness of the blocks can be changed, and the thickness of the concrete layer added on top can also be increased or decreased to suit various floor loads.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Random Talks on Building City Houses in Commercial Areas <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Shop houses or houses in small commercial areas have become extremely important in the construction industry in recent years. Let's take the United States as an example. In the past year, contracts signed by various construction companies show that this type of housing accounted for more than 50%. Although China's commerce is relatively backward, shop houses in urban areas naturally occupy an extremely important position in the construction industry. The rapid changes in shop habits and the rapid development of industry and commerce in recent years have directly and indirectly led to the frequent demolition, construction, or renovation of shop houses.</p>
<p>The form of shops is actively being modernized. As a result, shop houses have to be rebuilt frequently. When building these houses, the metals, glass, wood, and various new building materials used have been widely applied. The lighting in new-style shops is also different from the past. Reflective effects are often used to attract the attention of passersby. Therefore, the renovation and reconstruction of shops and commercial areas is rapidly expanding in major cities. At the same time, the development of industry and commerce has made the current limited number of shops insufficient, which has also led to the construction of new shops and commercial areas.</p>
<p>For the sake of modernizing shops and expanding commercial areas, even small cities are building commercial areas. However, we should also pay attention to the selection of sites before building city houses. The first step is to analyze the local situation. Is this location busy with pedestrians and vehicles? If it is busy, then we can use this site. After the site is found, we should pay attention to the display of goods in the kitchen windows and whether the work area of the staff in the shop is properly arranged. A walkway must be left out naturally. In fact, when building modern shops and shop houses, all work, including carpentry, earthwork, masonry, and plumbing, is different from the past.</p>
<p>Professional architects should take care of everything in the construction of city houses. After the house is built, whether it is suitable for the local environment, how much electricity is supplied by the local electricity company and lighting company, and how electric lights, reflective lights, and New Year's lights should be installed in the shop are all the architect's responsibility to plan. In a city where the population is rapidly increasing, residential areas are naturally expanding with the population. With a large population, the original central market will inevitably be inconvenient to supply all residential areas. Then, second-class markets will naturally be built around the central market. The location of these markets, the environment, and the level of residents in the surrounding residential areas must be considered. If they are all wealthy families, the shop houses must naturally be built more grandly. Conversely, if they are all ordinary people, then it can be more casual.</p>
<p>In recent years, we often hear about fires inside shops in cities. Because of the accumulation of goods in shops, many of them are flammable, so once a fire breaks out, it is irreparable and may even spread to multiple households. Regarding this point, we should pay extra attention to fire prevention when building city houses. If possible, the houses should be built with steel-reinforced concrete, and even doors and windows should be made of steel. Even the escalators should be made of iron railings and stone steps. If this is not possible, then use as little flammable wood as possible. More attention should be paid to fire prevention equipment.</p>

<p>Section Five: Testing of Building Materials</p>
<p>The purpose of material testing is to determine the characteristic properties of a material, whether it fully meets all the requirements in the ideal situation, and to determine the criteria for selection or rejection.</p>
<p>There are broadly two approaches to ordinary testing: chemical methods and mechanical methods.</p>
<p>1.  Chemical Testing Method: This method can be used to determine the various qualities of the components contained in a small sample, and all kinds of unfavorable and unnecessary impurities can also be detected.</p>
<p>2.  Mechanical Testing Method: This method can test the material's force capacity, elasticity, and other material properties described above.</p>
<p>In addition, when we have rich experience, our hands and eyes can also discern and judge the advantages and disadvantages of material properties to some extent, but this is only for convenience and not a proper method.</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Pig Iron</p>
<p>Section One: Iron Ore</p>
<p>Iron ore is a mineral. The pure form of iron ore is a type of iron oxide. Pig iron is produced by removing oxygen from this type of iron ore. The quality of iron ore is determined by the amount of iron it contains. Ore containing 50% or more iron is considered high-grade, while ore containing less than 50% is considered low-grade. Common impurities mixed in iron ore include sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon, all of which are undesirable in pig iron.</p>
<p>Section Two: Manufacturing of Pig Iron</p>
<p>To remove oxygen from iron ore, carbon is used for reduction. This carbon can be obtained from fuel coal. Because iron ore often contains impurities, limestone is also needed as a medium to combine and remove impurities. The manufacturing method involves a blast furnace, coke, limestone, iron ore, and the following steps:</p>
<p>(1) Place pig iron, coke, and limestone into the blast furnace in alternating layers, with the thickness ratio being 3/6 for pig iron, 3/8 for coke, and 1/8 for limestone. The furnace temperature must be 1000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>(2) Blow cold air into the furnace from the bottom, with a pressure of about 15 pounds per square inch.</p>
<p>(3) The carbon in the coke then absorbs oxygen and turns into carbon monoxide, which then combines with the hot oxygen in the iron ore to form carbon dioxide, causing the pig iron to sink to the bottom of the furnace and flow out.</p>
<p>(4) Impurities in the ore combine with limestone to form slag, which floats on the surface of the furnace.</p>
<p>Releasing gas once per hour, if we consider the consumption of 1000 tons of iron ore, 500 tons of coke, 300 tons of limestone, and 2000 tons of air, 500 tons of pig iron can be produced every six hours. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Wenying</p>
<p>(8) The Story of the First Few Movie Stars</p>
<p>In the previous section, I talked about the original meaning of "Hollywood" and how an unemployed set designer, Robert Blounton, discovered Hollywood. By 1916, Hollywood had become the center of the film world. Except for a few insignificant small companies that continued to work in various places for various reasons, all the important large companies had gathered in Hollywood. After a few more years, the eyes of the world were focused on the surroundings of that wasteland discovered by Robert Blounton.</p>
<p>We have also said before that in the early days of the invention of film, people in the theater industry looked down on movie actors. Famous actors on the stage would never go to film companies to make movies, and smaller actors, in order to earn some extra money, would agree to film secretly, fearing that their peers would know and ridicule them. However, when film companies from all over the world gathered in one place in Hollywood, and the potential of the film industry was unleashed in terms of both talent and financial resources, people in the theater industry could no longer ignore it forever.</p>
<p>The remuneration obtained by movie stars gradually exceeded what stage actors could earn, but Mary Pickford's mother unintentionally raised the status of movie actors in general. She first advised the filmmakers to suddenly inflate Mary's salary and spread the fact as a promotional material. Of course, Mary Pickford's mother's intention was only to allow her daughter to earn more money, but she did not know that in this way, the trend of movie actors earning high salaries began. From then on, the salary of a movie star was more than that of the head of a country, and the originator of this trend was the veteran movie queen, Mary Pickford. Now let's talk about the stories of some of the earliest movie stars.</p>
<p>Among the female stars of that time, in addition to Mary Pickford and Gloria Swanson, May Allison was also a prominent female star. After she came to Hollywood from Georgia, she suddenly became popular. She was one of the major stars of Metro Pictures, but strangely, her dress and behavior were as simple and innocent as a country girl.</p>
<p>At the same time, a romantic woman came from Russia, Nazimova. Her behavior was the opposite of May Allison's. Nazimova was the originator of what modern female stars call "glamour." These two people had completely different personalities, but they shared fame, and each had their own supporters. From this, it can be seen that Hollywood is a gathering place for various talents with different characteristics, and it is still the same today.</p>
<p>At that time, Nazimova's arrogance was so high that it made people retreat. She chose her own scripts, created her own magnificent sets, and made her own gorgeous and novel costumes. In this way, she added an incredible color and seductiveness to her works. This was something Hollywood had never seen before, and the general audience could not help but be fascinated by it. Nazimova was an extremely intelligent person, and she revealed a limitless future everywhere. Everyone felt that she lived for art, and that she would not experience the suffering of the world. But everyone guessed wrong. Now let's briefly talk about Nazimova's story of unrequited love.</p>
<p>When Nazimova came to Hollywood, she came with Charles Bryant. They lived together, and people always thought they were a couple. But soon this Bryant married another woman, and he and Nazimova were not divorced. Originally, he and Nazimova had never been married. Everyone discussed this matter, but they always thought that Nazimova would not be affected by anything. At this time, Paul Bern (who later committed suicide, Jean Harlow's husband) saw her inner sorrow. She was in New York at the time. She told the waiters in the hotel that she would not see any guests and would not answer any outside calls. Paul wanted to see her, but he couldn't. Later, he bribed the waiters and they let him up.</p>
<p>Paul Bern walked into Nazimova's room and persuaded her, "Hey, you can't be like this. You can't let people know you're sad. Quickly put on your most beautiful evening dress. I'll go out with you and let everyone see. This way, people will admire your courage." Nazimova listened to Paul Bern's words, and indeed, changed her clothes and went out with him. They went to all the major nightclubs in New York all night. Those who saw them were whispering and discussing. This incident was the first time that the private lives of movie stars received public attention. Later, the use of stars' marriages and love affairs as promotional materials also started from Nazimova's time. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e208">Two European Actresses Recently Arrived in Hollywood <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>We have heard many rumors that London is about to become the second film capital of the world, competing with and defeating Hollywood, and that Hollywood stars are gradually going to Europe, or being attracted to London. However, here, there are already two actresses who have been recruited by Hollywood from Europe. One is British, and the other is German.</p>
<p>The British actress is Merle Oberon, who co-starred with Douglas Fairbanks in "The Private Life of Don Juan." Since she is called the beauty in "The Private Life of Don Juan," her beauty is self-evident. Merle Oberon is indeed a beauty, and it is said that she was the result of several strict selections by the old Fairbanks.</p>
<p>Since "The Private Life of Don Juan" was filmed, although "The Private Life of Don Juan" itself was not a very successful work, the fame of its female lead, Merle Oberon, was very loud for a time, and Hollywood's 20th Century Fox quickly took the lead and recruited her.</p>
<p>It is said that after Merle Oberon arrived in Hollywood, filmmaker Darryl Zanuck spent a huge sum of $35,000 specifically for her makeover expenses. Among them, $25,000 was for wardrobe expenses, and $10,000 was for makeup expenses. This completely transformed a European beauty into the beauty in Hollywood's ideal.</p>
<p>The German actress came from the London film industry. She once played Catherine the Great in "Catherine the Great," so her name was already famous all over the world. She has now set off for the United States. She will first perform on the New York stage for some time, and then go to Hollywood.</p>
<p>This star is Elisabeth Bergner. It is said that she is as timid as a fawn and as afraid as a goat. When she arrives in the United States, from New York to Hollywood, she will avoid all reporters. Some people may say that she is imitating Garbo, but fearing reporters seems to be her nature. When she was in London, British reporters never got an interview with her. Perhaps the all-pervasive American reporters are more capable than British reporters. But perhaps the tough attitude of American reporters makes her even more afraid and avoids them even more.</p>
<p>Elisabeth Bergner's only protector is her multi-talented husband. When she was in England, she and her husband were inseparable. When she was on the set, her husband was always by her side. It is said that when her husband is not around, she will be lost and at a loss.</p>
<p>From this point of view, Hollywood is still recruiting talents from various foreign countries, and it doesn't seem to be declining. As the saying goes, a centipede does not collapse even in death, not to mention that Hollywood has not yet reached the point of death, so how can we say that it is collapsing?</p>
<h3 id="e209">"The Age of Innocence" Made into a Film <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Guocheng</p>
<p>Edith Wharton's literary masterpiece "The Age of Innocence," which shook New York society with its dramatic and moving subject matter not many years ago, has recently been adapted and arranged by the screenwriters of the Electric Hua Film Studio, and thus has been brought to the screen.</p>
<p>In the scenes that have been filmed, it strives to preserve the inherent sad atmosphere and plot of the original work, and tries to shorten many unnecessary components to describe a pure and flawless love that was defeated by customs.</p>
<p>The climax of the story is in explaining the strength shown to the male and female protagonists by the high moral and just concept, which has always forced them to bend to consider the code of "proper and polite actions."</p>
<p>Irene Dunne and John Boles play the leading roles in this film as a pair of Unrequiled Lovers. The performances they give to the audience not only maintain the most moving demeanor and actions based on past experience, but also succeed on top of their co-starring in "Back Street."</p>
<p>The main actors appearing in "The Age of Innocence" also include Julie Haydon and five very famous stars of the New York Stage Association – Lionel Atwill, Helen Westley, Laura Hope Crews, etc.</p>

<p>The first product of the New Era Company, "Mr. Wang's Secret," with the protagonists "Mr. Wang" and "Little Chen" still played by Tang Jie and Cao Xuesong, and produced by cartoonist Ye Qianyu himself. Since its premiere at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater, it has been more than a week, but the box office is still very crowded. The film is rich in jokes and has many gimmicks. From the opening to the closing, the theater is filled with laughter. Therefore, those who have seen this film have praised it as an unprecedented work of domestic comedy. It is also heard that the theater originally planned to change the film on Friday, but later continued to show it for several days due to excellent business. Those who have not seen this film, please do not miss it.</p>

<p>Since the Ant-Bee Drama Library began its trial operation of local mailing, the number of borrowers has been extremely enthusiastic. In order to meet the requirements of people from outside areas, the outer branch for mailing is also opened on March 1st. Local mailing is actively expanded and continues to recruit new readers. All those who love "emerging drama" can participate. Send a stamped envelope and post one cent to No. 15, Lane 310, New Chongqing Road, Shanghai, and it will be sent. A cost of three cents must be attached when requesting a list of books. It is also heard that the first type of loose-leaf play selection "The Misplayed Drama" (written by Masumi Fujii of Japan), selected and compiled by the compilation department of the library, has begun typesetting and is expected to be printed in March.</p>

<p>The new film "The Lives of a Bengal Lancer" recently completed by Paramount Pictures of the United States is one of the giant films selected by the company this year. The content describes the suppression of the British army when the Indian tribes rebelled. It was submitted to the Central Film Inspection Committee in the capital for inspection a month ago. It is recently learned that the Film Inspection Committee believes that the film promotes the imperialist suppression of weak nations, which violates Article 1, Paragraph 5 and Article 8 of the Film Inspection Law, and prohibits it from being shown. According to the meeting rules, the company is instructed to return the film to its country, otherwise it will be confiscated. It is also heard that the notification letter was delivered last week.</p>

<p>— Shumin</p>
<p>Suddenly there was the sound of a car outside the door, but she was in deep thought and grief, not paying any attention. The door inside and outside had nothing to do with her. Although she wanted to muster up the courage again, she couldn't lift her head for a moment. At this time, only Bose was staring blankly outside the door, utterly bored. He suddenly noticed the cars that had stopped. Several plainclothes detectives jumped out of the first car. Then a tall man walked out of the largest car and hurried towards the school door. Bose quickly opened the door and unconsciously cried out, "The President!" The man nodded slightly and walked in. The tall man walked slowly through the hallway, stopping from time to time to stroke the tables, as if he was touched by something.</p>
<p>He has now walked into the principal's office and is standing in front of Miss Beers. He recited like a child carrying a textbook, "God bless you, little one. Barefoot, carrying…" Miss Beers slowly raised her head, her tearful eyes blurred and she couldn't see who was standing in front of her, so she followed along like she was teaching a primary school student, "Carrying a reddish face." She then wiped away her tears, looked forward, and suddenly stood up with joy and shouted, "How did you come?" The President said kindly, "I am tired of politics… I feel that there are still many things in the world that I have not learned… There are still many things that you can teach me." As he said this, he walked towards Beers. Beers quickly took a step forward, and they embraced each other. At this time, Beers couldn't help but burst into tears.</p>
<p>Outside, Bose had gone mad and spread the news, and people from all over the city were coming to the school one by one. Jielai and Helunte also received the news and rushed over, but Kelalunsidaideby arrived before them. Jielai strode towards the school gate, walking and wondering, "Really? Is the President here? Why is he here?" Daide said, "If you must know, I telegraphed him." Jielai wanted to go in, but Daide stopped him. He said, "Jielai! You stand here with me and everyone else! You are just a country bumpkin, you haven't seen the world, what's the difference between you and others?" Jielai was furious and wanted to push him away, but he couldn't push him away.</p>
<p>After a while, the door opened and the President came out, with Miss Beers on his arm. Everyone was silent when they saw the President come out. The President then opened his mouth and said, "My friends… my fellow villagers… I have nothing to say now. I have come here to rest and think… and to pray… and to thank this good woman who has served society all her life, educated children, and created healthy citizens." He then turned to Miss Beers and said, "I owe my entire career to you, and I thank you especially." There was a burst of cheers from the crowd. At this time, Jielai whispered to Helunte, "Did you hear that? We can't ignore it. We just have to ask her to come back!" Jili and Sangdi, standing near them, heard what they said, and everyone held hands tightly and smiled at each other.</p>
<p>The President still grabbed Miss Beers's hand and said, "I am honored to shake hands with you, my teacher in childhood. In this way, I represent the people of the whole country to express my gratitude to these silent heroes again and again—because their enthusiasm for protecting the youth of the country is no less than the love of parents for their own children!" There was another burst of cheers from the crowd. At this time, Lulan Beers didn't know if she was in heaven or on earth. But she saw Kelalunsidaide, and Daide smiled at her slightly. She also saw the education inspector Helunte. He was a sycophant, and he hurriedly nodded and smiled at Beers. Her eyes then returned to the President. The President looked down at her, and his eyes revealed infinite respect—a brave warrior—able to survive in despair and turn defeat into victory! (The End)</p>
