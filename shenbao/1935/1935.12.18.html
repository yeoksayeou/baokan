<p>時評</p>
<h3>政府對人民之責任</h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>國運之轉移。政治之臧否。在訓政時期之今日。　於當局諸公之一轉念間。一念爲善。則种善因。一念爲惡。則得惡果。蔣院長於就職之日勉勵僚屬曰。『吾人服務政府。須知每一思念。每一舉動。皆有關於人民之安危苦樂。』斯言也。足以表現當局者對其責任之至高的認識。我人民苦顚沛久矣。日望有以蘇息之者。當局必於一思念一舉動間。無不以人民之苦樂安危爲心。方不愧爲人民之政府。且政府而能以人民之苦樂爲重。人民自當以政府之艱危爲念。如此一德一心。共赴國　。精誠所至。金石爲開。則又何事不可爲耶。</p>
<p>吏治之壞。由於官邪。官邪之來。則由於是非不明。責罰不行。北伐成功。亦甞以建設廉潔政府。號召於有衆。而吏治猶未能澄清者。考核或有所未周耳。此後若能對於公務人員之優良者予以保障。不力者不存姑息。使賢吏樂于自效。不肖者勉於爲善。實爲澄淸吏治之要圖。然欲補當局耳目之不及。則於現行之監察懲戒制度。似尙有斟酌損益之餘地也。</p>
<p>年來各地方莫不侈談建設。建設誠善。要當顧及民力財力之有無。天災頻仍。民力已瘁。財力已乏。休養生息之不暇。若乃不問緩急需要。而專以建設爲務。又跡近要功沽譽矣。今政府欲從振興生產事業入手。以實際裨益於人民生爲經濟建設之標準。可謂能得其要。蓋今日之中國。正患生產之不如人。不患享用之不如人。民窮財盡至於今日。可謂已極。若猶不事節儉。不加審擇。而惟形式上之建設是圖。則其爲　實不可勝言也。</p>
<p>內政修明。對外方有辦法。政府所可自效者在此。人民所望於政府者亦在此。</p>
<h3>平市當局　商討制止學生行動　由各校長負責勸導學生復課　一面通令軍警採取和平手段　武漢學生决籌組救國聯合會　宋哲元發表吿學生書</h3>

<p>北平　平各大學校長今在歐美同學會聚餐、到平大徐誦明、淸華梅貽琦、北大蔣夢麟、師大李蒸、燕大陸志韋等多人、餐后稍有聚議、首由各校長分別報吿各該校學生昨請願情形、旋卽討論平復學生運動辦法、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>天津　津中等以上學校院校長、十七日午後六時假女師學校集會、邀津市府秘書長孫潤宇·公安局長劉玉書·敎局長李金藻·等前往、請對平學生運動　勢、一爲解釋、孫等則希各院校長努力維持津各校院學生、靜心上課、勿輕有舉動、各院校長則希孫等轉達平當局、宜鑑靑年愛國熱誠、勿爲過甚、孫等允諾、嗣各院校長聯名電蔣院長王敎長平宋、要求速釋放被捕學生、津中等以上各校學生聯會擬十八日對平當局捕學生事有所表示、幷將召開會議、津南開校學生會十七日電京平當局、請釋放因愛國運動被捕學生、（十七日專電）</p>

<p>倫敦　本日晚間、此間盛傳不管部大臣艾登與外相霍爾均因意阿爭端解决方案、不滿人望、卽將提出辭職書、而由前外相張伯倫爵士重掌外交、政界人士則　爲首相鮑爾溫因欲避免閣潮、多所努力必能有所成就但延至明年一月間、現內閣人選、終當加以重大之變動云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>賴伐爾否認　對英施用狡猾　對外間風說表示憤慨</h3>
<p>總理兼外長賴伐爾將於明日閣議之時、初决試騐其和平方案之力量、興彼反對者爲不管部閣員激進社會黨領袖赫禮歐、赫氏曾稱、將以去就力爭該案之不當、惟觀察者則謂閣潮或可避免聞賴氏或將解釋彼與英國外相霍爾僅爲維持和平起見、草擬若干建議、以觀有關係之各方能吾接受耳、至於日內瓦方面、則賴氏將於星期三應付較爲嚴重之試騐、屈時國聯行政院開會、蘇俄、墨西哥、羅馬尼亞、捷克、希腦、士耳其等國、皆反對該項方案倘由行政院表决、反對者必佔多數、倫敦謠傳、賴氏曾施狡猾、致使霍爾贊同其和平方案云云、賴氏聞之頗爲憤怒、今日彼已準備於衆院辯論預算之時、臨時演說爲彼最近之行動辯護、並竭力吾認倫敦方面之傳說云、按據倫敦方面消息霍爾之所以同意、係受賴氏二决　聲恫嚇之愚、第一决係賴氏所謂曾受意相墨索里尼之託、聲明對對實施禁油、即爲戰爭、第二次係賴氏聲明、法國艦隊不能抵禦潛水艇之襲擊、故國聯防守地中海之責任、須由英國獨力担負云云、再倫敦時報對於和平方案中建議在阿國特闢一地帶、接通　屬愛立特里及索馬里一點、曾謂阿京至吉蒲堤之鐵道、所以未受意國轟炸、亦因法意之間有秘密協定之故、其交換條件、卽爲此項地帶云、賴氏對於此說亦震怒異常、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>阿皇表示不願獎意　作第三次侵略　但亦願促進和議</h3>
<p>阿京　阿皇今日在台西接見路秀訪員時宣稱、英法所商妥解決意阿戰爭之和平方案、縱在原則上接受之、亦爲對吾人民之懦行、對國聯與各國之叛舉、蓋彼等皆以爲集體安全制度今後深可恃也、」阿皇並切實聲明殊願便利任何釋爭方法之進行、但根據英法建議所獲之解决、將使侵略者與違背國際契的者得志云、阿政府發表公報稱、英法方案中議使阿國以整塊土地割讓侵略者、此徒足鼓勵意國作第三次企圖以征服阿國耳、至於阿南闢殖民區域之議、較之委　之代治、尤爲不堪、蓋在一切委託代治地、土人之利益、均予保衛、外人均享平等之待遇也、阿政府深信國聯行政院必不致接受該方案云、同時聞阿政府已以答覆議和條件之草稿電達日內瓦阿國代表團、衆信覆文中必拒絕該方案、但非切實的駁絕、文中表示阿政府之意見、以爲該方案多根據一九〇六年三方面條的而成、而該的則未經阿國予以承認也、該文又宣布議和條件實背一九〇九年法阿條的之精神、該的承認有阿外人同享平等權利、今阿南闢殖民區域之議、則以專有權利給予意國云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>意大使分訪英法　提出修正數點　英方不作答覆</h3>
<p>巴黎　據消息靈通方面聲稱、意國駐法大使塞呂蒂昨夜通告法總理賴伐爾、謂意相墨索里尼願對英法所提出之和平方案作下列之修正、</p>
<p>阿克森聖城應屬意國、</p>
<p>阿薩白港雖許阿國有權用之、但該港管理權仍應由意國握有、</p>
<p>阿南所闢意國殖民區域內所有外入享有之讓與權應全取銷、</p>
<p>意國必須享有該境警政全權、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　意國大使格蘭第、頃於午後訪問外務决官汪西泰爵士、雙方會談的半小時、聞意國大使此行、係就英法兩國所提解决爭端方案、再度要求說明、但據羅馬方面傳來消息、意國政府現擬提出對案如下、</p>
<p>原案所擬意國殖民地帶、當問西面擴展、至阿國與英埃蘇丹交界處爲止、（原案係西至東經錢三十五度爲止）、</p>
<p>意國當在伊里特里亞劃出地帶、聽任阿國建築海港、未便以亞薩勃港給予之、</p>
<p>原案所擬殖民地帶、得由意國建築鐵道、俾經過阿京西面而與意屬伊里特里亞瑪薩華港相銜接、</p>
<p>阿國當以哈拉爾省經濟讓與權給予意國，</p>
<p>蒂格里省阿克遜聖城、當爲意國所有、俾該城敎會長老向意軍投誠者、不受阿國政府之報復、</p>
<p>此間政界人士、以爲此項對案、如果確實、其用意當在試探英法兩國意見、設使意國眞有此項耍求、英國政府自必堅决加以拒絕、首相鮑爾溫或且乘機撤回原案亦未可知、此在外務部人士則謂意國若果再度有所需索、英國决不能加以接受云、</p>
<p>又按巴黎廻聲報駐倫敦訪員所得消息、意國對案第一二兩點、與上述相同、關於第三點、較爲詳盡、謂意國要求、按照一九〇六年英法意三國條的及一九二五年英意恊定所載、在阿國京城以西、建造鐵路、使意屬伊里特里亞與意屬索謀里蘭、聯成一氣、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　意國駐英大使格蘭第爲得關於英法和平方案之更詳消息以報告法西斯黨最高會議起見、昨英外交部外次樊西太特氏會談半小時、格氏提出許多問話、樊氏未予答告、僅將問話紀錄備考、法西斯黨最高會議已定明日開會考慮英法和平方案、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>意將展緩答覆　顧慮外交情形</h3>
<p>據本社訪員所知、意國政府頃因顧慮外交發展情形起見、對於英法兩國和平方案、仍當展緩提出復文、至法西斯黨最高會議、雖定於明日開會、茲以英國下院與法國衆院、日內均將開始外交辯論、其結果如何、尚在不可知之數、因而法雪斯黨最高會議、對於英法和平方案、亦未必立卽有所决定云（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅馬公報　承認阿軍進攻得利</h3>
<p>羅馬　今日此間發表公報、承認阿軍進攻得利、據謂西北陣綫之阿軍三千人進攻意軍、意軍中之伊利特里雜色隊伍之哨兵猛禦後、已沿梅蒂美希特澗附近之　太加士河一帶退走、同時另有阿兵一團、在下游渡河、以期包圍塞爾區域之意軍、該區域之人民近已降服意軍、因阿軍之進攻之結果、雙方已從事大戰、刻正在進行中、意軍有飛機與武裝汽車爲助云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>莫斯科日報著論　抨擊英法建議　違反盟約鼓勵侵略</h3>
<p>莫斯科　法文莫斯科日報社論方評英法「巴黎計劃」、謂「意大利用其武裝未能獲得之勝利、今日必須借重其强鄰如英法等國、壓迫阿比西尼亞而得之、故英法遂爲意大利侵略行動之參加者」、該報指明日內瓦接得此項妥洽建議時、適值考慮制裁問題之時、「制裁之意、乃令阿國在意阿不平等之衝突中、得有援助以抵消怠大利之武力、今則不然、彼等建議國聯、重予意方以援助、如此則阿國不僅將屈服於意大利物質壓迫之下、且將屈服於國聯精神壓迫之下、國聯行政院如不欲摧毀國聯之權威與存在、則其對於此項建議將如何答覆、絕無疑義、</p>
<p>「英法如此行動、如純以個別資格、因某種原因願令意阿戰爭及早結束、此猶可說、所不幸者、草擬此項建議者竟揑稱彼等乃奉國聯之命爲之、故國聯行政院第一須揭破此種假借、指明國聯機關從未委任英法援助侵略國家、行政院須聲明彼與巴黎計劃絕無關係、</p>
<p>「其次、盟約第十條保障國聯各會員國之領土完整與不可侵犯、國聯行政院應再向起草該項建議國家、重新提醒此點、巴黎計劃如稍稍承認、則必壓迫阿國援助侵略國家、如此則不僅有損阿國之獨立、且威脅國聯之生命、國聯會員國中除若輩一向在精神上壓迫國聯、而今日則欲於物質上壓迫國聯者以外、其於上述觀點、必能完全同意無疑、嚴格言之、巴黎建議如尚未經參戰國同意、則國聯行政院不能接受之、國聯行政院對於巴黎或其他建議、在阿國尚未表示接受之前、不能加以考慮、</p>
<p>「國聯行政院對於此項滿足意國貪慾之建議加以同意、則聯盟已矣、全世界報紙均謂國聯如如此行動、則爲津貼侵略國家、彼不僅鼓勵其他好戰國家之侵略、即意大利亦將更進一步侵略也、此决戰爭意國如能勝利、（巴黎計劃即使意國有巨大勝利）則此後　彼必加入侵略　國家之列、反對國聯、反對集體安全制度、反對鞏固和平、企圖發動新的戰爭、</p>
<p>「吾人如謂德意矛盾令彼等絕對不能合作、則屬大誤、彼等如能相互援助相互鼓勵、從事侵略、則其障礙末始不能除去、日本佔有整個滿洲之後、猶繼續進攻、意國行徑亦將如是、願望意阿戰爭及早結束、此點未可非難、在某種程度上各國均已參加製裁、世界另一方面之局勢規正漸决成熟、凡和平之友均萬分注意及此、彼等且欲解脫意阿衝突給予彼等之苦悶、唯以上所云、均未能證明摧毀國聯（彼爲最近鞏固之和平工具）之議爲合理也、如欲如是、則於和平大有妨礙、而允以在目前嚴重情勢之下爲然、吾人深信國聯行政院於被追贊同破壞盟的之巴黎建議時、其責任究何若云、（十六日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>英將增稅　限制外蛋進口　英農產改進會之主張</h3>
<p>倫敦　關於改進蛋類生產事業之專門委員會、頃發表報告書、中張由不列顚帝國以外各地輸入之鮮蛋、每一百二十枚增加入口稅六便士、換言之卽將外國蛋類之入口稅（從值稅）由百分之二十、提高至百分之二十五或三十、此項稅收之四分之一、將用以津貼本國蛋類生產事業、此外、該報告書並主張將本國春季產之蛋酌量貯藏、以備秋季之用、同時限制春季外國蛋類入口數量、俾使供求得相適合、此項報告書發表之後、每日電聞報特著文評論、其於近年流質蛋品入口增加一層允爲注意、據稱、流質蛋品入口數量、自最近十年以來、業已增加兩倍、去年輸入數量的佔全國消費量八分之一、其大部份來自中國、但多數歐洲大陸國家則以不滿於中國出品之製造與包裝情形、率多禁止其輸入、若以英國而言、其用於國內製造業者旣屬此項流質蛋品、則縱令增加鮮蛋入口稅、其於流質蛋品冰蛋等之入口、固無絲毫影響、以故該報認爲增加鮮蛋稅一舉實非正辦、則以上　委員會報告書中所列舉之理由、殊不足以證明此舉爲必耍也云、（十七日哈　斯電）</p>
<h3>我國藝術　使世界衣飾受感應</h3>
<p>倫敦　國際中國美術展覽會已使世界衣飾受切實之感應、蓋於色彩上巳發生幾種新見解也、英國色澤委員會現正謀於明年一月間採展覽會谷品之色彩製成絲綢與布疋、英后已定製翠綠色之衣一　、該會至十一月十四日止、參觀者已達一百四十六萬八千二百九十八人、每日平均逾四千人、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日外相廣田決定　刷新外交陣容　大使公使將有大更動　有田內定任駐華大使</h3>
<p>南京　外務省內定於十六日正午在决官官邸、開人事會議、恊議之結果、决定如下、於日內發表、</p>
<p>外務書記官（歐亞局第一課長）西春彥任靑島總領事、外務書記官加瀨俊任歐亞局第一課長、大使館一等書記官（德國）杉下裕决郞任海參威總領事、外務書記官（電信課長）米澤菊二任喀爾喀特總領事、大臣秘書官秋山理敏任外務書記官兼電信課長、外務務官（條的局）安東義良兼任大臣秘書官、父明春大使公使級將有相當廣範圍之異動、有吉駐華大使明年一月中旬歸國待命以有田駐比大使繼之、以通商局長來栖一）郞任駐比大使、以澤田紐約總領事或村井新德里總領事任通商局長、其他駐滿大使館二谷參事官。越田巴達維亞總領事、三宅喀爾喀特總領事、酒匈駐蘇參事官、及待命之松宮參　官、將任公使或法國土耳其蘇聯大使館參事官等、松平駐英大使是否歸任、尚爲疑問、如不能歸任將以重光决官繼之、次官後任將由堀內美國局長昇任、太田駐蘇大使之勇退、亦將於明年中實現、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>海軍會議打開僵局　英國提出新建議　交換造艦計劃六年爲期　日本堅持共同最高限度</h3>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議第一委員會、頃於午後賡續開會對於日本所提共同最高限度之主張、當議决暫行擱置、幷定於明日研究英國所提、量的限制案、散會後發表公報稱、「委員會頃應日本代表團之請、對於該國所提共同最高額實行方法、詳細加以研究、幷决定留待日後重行審議、而於明日開會討論英國「量的限制案」云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海相孟珊爾今日宣布、英國將於星期二提出海軍問題量的限制之計劃、據其內容、世界海軍强國今後六年以內互相交換造艦計劃、日本首席代表永野大將則謂、日本須於聆取他國之建議以後、始能發表日本之要求云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦　昨日海軍會議總代表集議後、海會情勢有新變化、其他各國代表對日本所提出之平等要求多所質問、卒不能引起該要求折衷辦法之徵象、故乃决議爲便利海會工作起見、日代表應對該問題繼續作雙方面的討論、而大會則應改變立塲、從事討論英國所提出各類軍艦量的限制之建議、英國之建議請各國聲明後數年內所擬减少之數量、其年數現未確定、爲避免一再召集大會起見、英國主張以六年爲期、惟法意兩國已聲明反對作長時期的條的担任、聞英國之建議僅圖獲具體之數字、俾能依此進行談判、大會將於今日午後三時十五分重行開會、雙方面的日本平等要求之談話、將於今晨由日代表團訪美代表團開始之、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據一般人所知、日本代表團雖已應允討論英國海軍提案、但不能認爲該國對於共同最高額之主張業已有所讓步、緣該國僅允在海軍平等範圍以內、考慮英國提案故也、美國代表團發言人則謂英國提案、尚未獲知內容、其耍領所在、必須維持現行海軍均勢、勿使大有出入、始可加以接受云、海會委員會明日開會時、會議程序雖已變更、各國代表團大抵仍當維持原來態度、至於意法兩國、則因英國提案載有長時期之的束、未必加以贊同、此層乃各該國素所反對者、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美日與英日　分別舉行談話</h3>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議今日復開美代表台維斯反對日本海軍平等要求、又與日代表永野發生一度舌戰、永野宣稱、共同限度一旦成立、則不威脅不侵略之事態亦得成立、台維斯則駁稱、「如是則無人能阻止軍備充實之國侵略無軍備之弱國矣、」此言顯係譏刺日本之侵略中國、並聞美日代表曾舉行私的會議、以冀打破僵　、其經過雖稱良好、但並無結果、事後美代表復與英代表會談、繼續討論六年中交換造艦計劃問題、（十七日國民社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　一般人以爲海軍會議美日兩國代表今晨會晤時曾就英國所提「量的限制案」大綱、有所討論、但因此案內容、猶未諗悉、會談結果、幷未獲有新因素、所可知者、雙方曾以英國提案爲基礎、而討論美日兩國所提主張有無較爲接近之可能、事後美國代表曾訪問英國海軍部、常由該部人員、告以英國提案詳情、此項提案、將在午後第一委員會卽海軍問題總委員會、提出加以討論、又今晨美國首席代表台維斯、曾偕該國其他代表、拜會意國代表團人員、至日未首席代表永野大將、亦曾率同該團人員、拜會法國首席代表戈爾平大使、凡此均屬酬酢性質、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　永野永井兩全權、十六日上午十一時訪問英國海軍省英國代表作日英第二决私的會談、經過一小時半始畢、會談始終以英國脆弱性理論及日本共通最大限度設立問題爲中心、並就調查實際海軍兵力問題進行交涉、日代表以說伏英國之策戰百般努力、然關於適用問題、未能達到具體討論、遂定於下决會談繼續談判、據聞英代表查打費提督席上對日代表謂、英國爲會議之主辦國、設法極力避免逢着疆局、俾會議得圓滿成功、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日海軍當局　對英案之見解</h3>
<p>東京　日海軍部對於英國提議造艦宣言案說、表示此决意見、聞英國提交造艦宣言案、日本不必拒絕本問題之討論、然其內容似與日本根本方針大有懸隔、卽其第一項、謂各國政府確保海軍力之平等、而在一定年度內應自動宣言造艦計劃、通達　國政府、日本政府要求者非原則上之平等係實質的平等、故先解决實　平等問題後討論造艦案、至爲正當、又英國提案中規定當各國宣言造艦不受比率主義或其他國際的束縛、可應所要數量樹立計劃、但預先與各國協定各艦種最高保有限度、不得建造此限度以上之軍艦、此項規定、令人感想承認日本根本主張、然其實際以現有勢力爲基礎、藏爲延長比率主義之伏錢、故仍然與日本有應方針互相背馳、其實施期間之長短時不成問題（十七日日聯電）</p>
<h3>變更議程主因</h3>
<p>倫敦　本日午後海軍會議第一委員會開會時、日本代表忽同意將所提共同最高額主張暫緩討論、而允於明日會議中、開始討論英國所提「量的限制案」、此舉殊出人意外、事後委員會發表公報、雖謂日本提案延緩討論、係屬暫時性質、但在事實上、恐已無期展緩矣、按會議程序突然變更、主因所在、蓋自會議開幕以來、英美兩國對於日本主張始終反對、以致演成僵局、本日會議中、各國代表咸曾竭盡智慮以期打開僵局、重覓坦途、允其是欲明瞭日本所提共同最高額之主張、是否可与英美两国主张相调和、蓋英美兩國主張　各國地理上軍略上之實况各不相同、則其海軍兵力自可隨而保持相當差別、關於此層、日本代表會加以說明、謂各國海軍力之不同自可贊同、他日共同最高額擬成之後、各國建艦數量過與不及、固無不可、但其差別不應過鉅云云、美國代表當即敦促日本代表、就此項問題提出具體建議、日本代表乃答謂、討論實施細則　、此乃海軍會議之任務、非日本所得專擅、至此、各國代表相繼發表意見、末由英國代表提議、將日本主張暫予保留、以待日後重行審議、幷主張第一委員會考慮該國所提「最的限制」問題各國代表連日本代表在內、當卽表示贊成、一星期來由日本主張所引起之一塲爭辯、至此始乃暫告結束、（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>第一委員會　前日會議情形　海軍平等原則未獲承認　日表示拒絕討論具體案</h3>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議第一委員會、於十六日下午三時開會、日本永野永井兩軍、岩下專門委員、山形書記官、溝田翻譯官出席、各國全權亦帶極少數委員出席、由　海相孟賽爾任主席、首先發言、謂今日會議依照前决會議之議决、極力縮少第一委員會之規模、限制出席人員、希各國全權盡量開陳意見、由一般的討論、進至個別的問題之折衝、由原則論入具體論、於　以日本共通最大限度問題之討論爲導火綫、各國全權俟决發言、並對日全權詢問有無讓步餘地、永野全權對此言明日本立塲不能退後一步、又對於耍求表示共通最大限度數字之提議、仍然主張先行承認原則論、謂原則一旦確定、則不難解决數字問題、會議至五時五分散、今日會議不過重復討論上週所議事項、毫無進展、日本代表於原則確定以前、始終拒絕討論具體問題、各國代表因日本不採妥恊之途徑、殊覺失望、下决會議定於十七日下午三時續開、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>美銀議員集團改組　續有銀案奮鬥</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美聯社記者今日得悉、洛磯山一帶各州之國會議　將改組衆院之銀集團、以利爲銀案奮鬥、國會於一月初開會時該團卽可改組就緒、而由衆議員繆達克爲領袖、現聞西部多數議員對於財部之實施購銀法、表示不滿、俟詳細調查後、卽將提出補救計劃、以前之銀派議員亦將與傾向於彼等目的之參議員密切合作、對於四大巨頭允甚、四大巨頭卽參議員畢德門、金威廉湯邁斯及韋勒、此舉影響如何、尚難逆料、蓋以參衆兩院之銀派將發牛異議也、衆院銀派議員顯認恩給金案中加入白銀附文爲不妥、但對於其他議案、彼等或將與衆院通貨膨脹派合作、消息靈通觀察者咸信、下屆國會辯論白銀案之久暫、大概將視會期之短長而定、羅斯福總統如能縮短會期、則白銀或將成爲决要問題、如會期延至四月以外、則銀案定將成爲熱烈辯論之中心、白銀問題對於明年總統選舉時西方各州關係甚巨、西部各州之民意測騐已表示人民對於新政之興趣日减、政府或將利用銀問題爲政府標榜也、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>胡佛抨擊新政　直接對羅斯福挑戰</h3>
<p>加州巴洛阿爾託　前總統胡佛今日答復羅斯福總統感謝節之演說、此係胡氏對於現政府最直接之挑戰、羅斯福總統所稱文化之機在一九三三年三月三日已歸停頓一節、完全爲胡氏所吾認、胡氏認羅斯福總統就職時頒布之國家銀行止付令、係存欵人及銀行當局神經過敏所促成、胡佛深信經濟恐慌之狂潮在一九三二年七月選舉時、已見轉機、經濟進步亦見端倪、卽無羅氏之新政亦必逐漸改善、胡氏復抨擊救濟制度、稱政府提創之救濟制度、前爲吾人所竭力反對、目前救濟工作之浪費腐敗實不堪言狀云、（十六日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本的元老重臣（上）　精神運動派與自由主義派的暗鬥</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>我們要知道日本政局的變動，先得明白日本元老重臣的性質，因爲他們的一舉一動，是可以左右大局的。近年來新軍閥的勢力，雖則日益强大，有凌駕元老重臣之勢，但是無論何種重要國事，仍舊要經過他們的贊同，方可决斷。現在就把日本元老重臣對國家的關係，簡單的陳述如後。</p>
<p>一、最近的元老</p>
<p>今日日本的元老，祇有西園寺公望一人，重臣還有七人；即內大臣牧野伸顯伯爵，樞密院議長一木喜德郞男爵，選任總理大臣淸浦奎吾伯爵，會任民政黨總裁若機禮决郞男爵，前任總理大臣齋藤實子爵，選任大藏大臣高橋是淸。這些元老重臣，站在日本政界的最高地位，實際上就是製造內閣的要人，左右大局的舵手。每當政局發生變動的時候，世人都注視着他們的行動，因爲就在這等時候，他們可以進言於日皇，以資採决，但是他們對於一般施政，却絕對不願置喙。他們每到內閣組成之後，就任憑內閣自由行動，絕不參加意見，干涉施政方針。這是今日唯一的元老西園寺所奉的信條，亦即爲日本立憲政治眞正的精神。</p>
<p>元老的成爲公式化，起自大正元年。從前的元老，大權獨攬，好像太上老君。譬如伊藤博文，山縣有明，幷上馨，松方正義等，稱爲維新的元老門，常在內閣的上面，左右施政的重大方針，因此日本歷代內閣，往往受元老的掣肘。到了西　寺公爵，他因遭山縣·井上·松方各巨頭的傾軋，發生過宮中彈劾的大變，覺得這種弊端，很不相宜，自已旣爲元老，就以已身作則，永不干預政見，直到現在，始終不渝。</p>
<p>西園寺元老的資格，在大正元年八月得到公認。這時的巨頭，有山縣有明公爵，大山嚴公爵，桂太郞公爵，井上馨侯爵，松方正義侯爵等五人。大正即位的時候，召五人至宮中，親下勅旨道：「　朕今猝承大統，夙夜兢兢，惟恐不逮，卿等多年輔弼先帝，親承聖旨，朕今紹先帝遺業，仍望卿等，忠心匡輔。」時總理大臣爲西園寺，（尚居侯爵）他單獨奉到勅語：「朕繼大統，適值內外多事之秋，夙夜憂慮，深恐有負先帝遺業。以後「宮中府中，宜相互協力」贊　朕事。卿旣膺輔國大任，善體此旨，並傳達諸臣」這勅語中「宮中府中，宜相互恊力」一語，就是諭令各方，協調一氣，勿存私見，互相傾軋的意思。所以西園寺秉承了這兩句肯要的勅語，躬行實踐，對於國務，不復事事徵求宮臣的意見，弄得山縣等元老無可如何。</p>
<p>大正元年十二月，西園寺下合時候，因爲能鞠躬盡瘁，忠心耿耿，得了優詔，獎譽備至。於是西園寺聲望益隆，入於元老之列。原來西園寺爲人，非常公正，沒有偏見，而且具有宏博的職見，敏銳的判斷力，處理萬事，總立於純粹客觀的地位。</p>
<p>在這二十年中，所有元老，相繼凋謝，現今祇有他一個人了。他今年已有八十六歲，仍舊忠誠奉公，始終不渝，每遇政變，日皇必遺特使與他商榷。他以不偏不黨的態度，斟酌內外情勢，　　日皇，所以日本近年來產生的內閣，都上下能够翕服。</p>
<p>說到重臣，他們的身分與職務。還沒有公式化，不過各有各的一部分潛勢力罷了，「重臣會議」起於去年。去年七月，齋　內閣總辭職的時候，繼任內閣人選，按照舊例，可由西園寺一人奏薦。西園寺自　年老，想到將夾身後發生政變時，後繼內閣之組織，應當有相當的辦法。他乃招集內大臣，樞密院議長以及有首相經騐的人，徵求後繼內閣的意見。此即所謂重臣會議。岡田內閣就是這樣產生的，當時出席者。爲一木喜德郞男爵，淸浦奎吾伯爵，若槻禮次郞男爵，齋藤實子爵，高橋是淸等數人，他們皆有重臣的資格，旦爲各派中錚錚首領。這决會議的意義，非常重大。以後日本組閣，大的都要照這方式產生了。</p>
<p>昭和七年五月，發生五一五事變時，西園寺本也召集過重臣們，討論善後。當時的重臣，還有東鄕，上原海陸軍大元帥二人，會議結果，推薦齋藤實組閣。這一次會議，是非正式的，後來西園寺覺得還算妥當。等到去年組織岡田內閣時，才正式决定「重臣會議產生新閣的原則。不過重臣們除了選定內閣閣員外，仍舊不能干涉施政方針。</p>
<p>當齋藤內閣時代，日政府决議退出國際聯盟，山本權兵衛伯爵會以問題重大，應常召開重臣會議，以定內閣去留。齋滕因山本爲先輩，贊成其意。後赴興津請示西園寺。西園寺聞言，大不爲然，以政府所定政策，不應受重臣的干涉，結果仍照政府固定方針實行。原來西園寺素重責任內閣制，主張一切政務，由政府完全負責，政策的成敗，惟政府是問。政府以外的人，絕不應參加意見，紛亂朝綱，這才可以發現立憲政治的精神。西　寺此種主張，各重臣大都表示尊重。所以日本近年立憲政治的發展，不得不歸功於西　寺一人。</p>
<p>二、自由主義的重臣</p>
<p>自山本逝世，重臣們都帶有自由主義的色彩，其中心人物，爲牧野伸顯伯爵。牧野爲內大臣，接近日皇，負輔弼大任。照格位而言，淸浦奎吾伯爵，本應居於首位。因爲淸浦前後組了二决內閣，而且會任樞密院議長，其在明治大正二代的閱歷，是可與西園寺並肩的。可是淸浦已與政界脫離關係，加以年邁，靜居熱海，不問世事，故由牧野領導重臣們。牧野與西園寺思想相同，對於宮廷，以及內閣，都有密切關係。他以自由主義爲根本思想，極得重臣們的信仰，也就可以說他是自由主義重臣們的領袖。扶助牧野最力者，爲一木喜德郞男爵。一木博通古今，選任文部大臣，內務大臣，樞密院顧問官，樞密院副議長。後來牧野轉任內大臣，一木繼任宮相。一木當初所以能任樞密院顧問，是出於山縣有明的意思。因爲樞密院在維新時代，完全爲伊藤博文的勢力所支配。如伊東已代治，金子堅太郞二人，在院內頗佔勢力，山縣是因爲一木頭腦明敏，思想豐富的緣故，特薦至樞密院，監視伊藤派的。</p>
<p>至於若槻禮决郎男爵，齋藤實子爵，高橋是淸等，本在重臣的外圈，但是他們在今日政界，勢力極爲雄厚。換句話來說，他們三個人，與現實政治的環境，各有特殊的關係。若槻會任內閣總理，民政黨總裁，齋藤爲前任內閣總理，近以肅淸選舉運動相號召，將來有後繼岡田內閣的希望。他與岡田現首相，關係尤密，與重臣同盟」淵源亦深。其黨羽甚多，高橋在金融界，佔極大勢力，主張穩健，有左右政局的潛勢力。所以這三個人，雖不在重臣們的圈子內，但其思想，那是共通的。譬如若槻的政黨政治論，齋藤的憲政常道論，高橋的排斥法西斯蒂論，都提倡着自由主義與民主主義。因此他們的思想，與重臣們相脗合，這是今日日本决定後繼內閣的人選，不得不本此主義的理由。</p>

<h3>義務教育</h3>
<p>— 敎育部普通敎育司司長顧樹森</p>
<p>最後，個人對於實施義敎辦法，還有一些意見，請大家加以研究，幷希望共同起來協助進行，使得我國的義務敎育，得以早日普及。</p>
<p>第一件要和大家商討的，就是籌措義敎經費，我國提偶義務敎育，已經有二十餘年了，檢查過去的事實，政府的計劃儘是計劃，實際上總是效果很小，最大的原因，就因爲籌措經費沒有當相的辦法，經費問題不先解决，那裏能够呌各地方辦起許多來呢？以民窮財盡的我國，大宗義敎經費都要靠地方自籌，固然勢不可能，但是要政府籌措大宗經費來補助，實際上還是要取之於人民的，所以最要緊的問題，無論省地方自籌與中央補助，必須先把義敎經費的夾源確定，才是正常解决的出路，這决重整旗鼓，上下一致的積極推行義敎，對於本年度的經費，先有中央補助，復經各省市竭力籌措，不獨不生問題，幷且很是可觀，不過對於下年度如何增加，如何籌措，尚無相當辦法，假使來源不確實規定，以後如何爲繼，很是危險的，現在對於各省市籌集義務敎育經費，已由敎育部會同財政部擬訂籌集暫行辦法大綱，幷業已呈奉行政院備案，照第二條規定，各省縣市各小學區內的義敎經費，應看設校的數量，定需要經費的多少，由各縣市就地自籌半數以上，第五條規定各省縣市籌集義敎經費的範圍共五項，　縣市政府呈准省府指定學產的收入，　縣市政府呈准省府指定合法捐稅及附加捐稅的收入，！縣市政府鄉鎮或學區內整理原有學產增加的收入，　熱心公益人士對於義敎經費自願的捐贈，　縣市或鄉鎭由人民自動公議依法呈准分擔的欵項，這五項範圍，是籌措義敎經費的五個泉源，可是好像泉水還埋藏在山石下面，必須盡大家的力量，通力探索，才能够開發出來，源源不絕的供給推行義敎之用，此外中央及省補助費，也希望中央政府及省政府把夾源開闢穩固，才不會臨時枯竭。</p>
<p>第二個問題就是調查學齡兒童與劃分小學區，這兩項是實施義敎的基本工作，但是調查學齡兇童是一件很麻煩的工作，因此過去各地方大都敷衍了事，沒有澈底去辦理，其實祇須小學區劃定以後，每區設好了學董，分頭着手去辦理，幷不是最麻煩的，等到各區學校成立以後，敎師和學生更可以隨時幫助調查了，劃分小學區是實施義敎的最小單位，區域决不可定得太大，和過去所劃的學區不同，很有許多人以爲儘可就原有行政區或自治區來做學區，這是大大的錯誤，因爲我們現在要劃的小學區，就是設置一個短期小學的區域，不但要顧及到區內的兒童上學便利，還要計算到一個學董辦理調查學童籌措經費强迫兒童入學等等工作，都能够隨時往來接洽，不致於太困難，所以施行細則裏規定按照人口來分區，並不完全按照地域來分區，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>第三個問題是組織各級義務敎育委員會和遴選學董，過去推行義敎不能成功的原因雖很多，但是各級推動機關沒有完密組織，也是一個很重大的原因，所以這决從中央以至於縣單位，都耍組織義敎委員會，協助敎育主管機開辦理實施工作，他的權力，不單是一個諮訽機關，對於經濟的支配動用保管，以及計劃審核指導調查等，都經規定，付予重大的責任，以利進行，學董是實施義敎基本組織的推動人員，一個小學區的義敎，是否能够進行順利，如期完成，完全要看各小學區內選任的學董是否得力而定，所以遴選學董，必須就當地富有資望，辦事忠實，明白事理，幷有相當敎育程度的人充任。</p>
<p>第四個問題是訓練師資，短期小學旣經按着小學區都要設立，那末一時需要的師資，其勢必多，假使當地師資不够，儘可招收有相當敎育程度的，由縣市辦理短期訓練班，授以敎學方法，訓導方法，學校行政組織法，及各種必須的敎學常識和技能，課程不必繁瑣，假使功課太多，反而無後，這是最要緊的原故。</p>
<p>第五個問題是推設短期小學與充實原存小學的學級學額，推設短期小學的目的，是要在短期間內使失學兒童都得到受相常的敎育，所以當地如有祠廟或公共塲所可以利用的，應當盡量利用，一切設備也無須求其完備，以節經費，同時對於原有的小學，幷應該盡力擴充學級，補足學額，其他機關或學校，也應該就可能範圍以內，酌量附設短期小學班，短期小學及短期小學班的編制，以辦理二部制爲原則，半日制或全日間時敎學制，不妨斟酌環境採擇辦理。</p>
<p>第六個問題是改良私塾和巡迴敎學等，我們所以要辦短期小學的目的，剛才已經說過，那末當地如有私塾，也應該設法指導改良，並應該擇定適當時間，辦理塾師訓練，每次訓練時間不必過長，不妨隔了相當時期，再予召集訓練，訓練工作，儘可委託當地的師範和中學兼辦，以節省經費，巡迴敎學，是用以敎導偏僻鄕村及沒有學校可進的一般失學兒童，是一種補助學校不足的方法，所以巡迴敎師，必須選擇刻苦耐勞熱心敎學的人員仟之，巡迴的區域和時間，可就當地情形分別辦理，要之推行義敎的方法，愈多愈好，各地方儘當地情形，斟酌採行，就是像小先生制，如果試騐得有成效，也不仿提倡推行。</p>
<p>第七個問題是各地方施行義務敎育應付託縣長負完全責任，各地方實施義務敎育，如劃分學區，調查學齡兒童，借用校舍，强迫兒童入學等等工作，隨時隨地需要當地的行政佐理人員，辦理地方自治人員，以及公安局的長警等協助進行，而允以籌措義敎經費，關係十二分重大，所以必須付託縣長負起完全責任，然後指揮辦理，處處得以順利進行，因此對於縣長辦理義務敎育的老成，更希望各省當局予以嚴重的注意。</p>
<p>最後我還要希望各地人民應該深切明瞭推行義務敎育是我們救國圖强復興民族的治本工作，人人應該負着協助推行的責任，所以最後的一句話，要請全國同胞共同起來，完成實施義務敎育工作。（完）</p>

<h3>上海公司業概况</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>上海之水泥業</p>
<p>（一）導言　水泥為近代新興之工業，亦為　代建築工程中三大要素之一。在水泥未發明以前，代用合土」，遠不若水泥之堅緻美觀，且用於水閘堤岸等處，每易被水冲潰。自水泥業發明後，世界建築術為之一新。我國以前水泥，均由外洋輸入。迨至光緒末葉，始有啟新洋灰公司接辦英商開平礦務局附設之水泥廠；嗣後華商水泥公司及中國水泥公司亦相繼成立。惟因事屬初創，出品禾精，且產量有限，而同時國內需要日增，故外貨輸入仍旺、迨歐戰突起，歐美無暇東顧，國產水泥業，曾一度勃興；迨歐戰結束，各國東亞市塲恢復，水泥進口又呈活躍氣象。民十年以後，進口額與年俱增，每年漏巵恒在二百萬兩以上；二十一年後，全國經濟恐慌，日益深刻，本市地產業建築業，更一落千丈，二十三年七月，政府復提高海關進口稅率，進口額乃銳减，惟本年輸入額，較去年同期，又形增加。聞係我國某機關訂購大批外貨，且准免稅進口之故。國產水泥，近年來亦與外貨同陷不景氣中，自最近財部頒布新貨幣政策以來，市面似可趨恢復之途；若地產業能漸呈活躍，則建築業自必隨之發達，水泥業前途，當有轉機也。</p>
<p>（二）沿革　查我國水泥廠，以英商開平礦務局附骰之水泥製造廠為濫觴，時在前淸光緒二年（西歷一八七六年），此為我國境內水泥製造工業之嚆矢旋以內部管理欠善，出品銷路備受阻滯，致虧損。甚鉅，迨光緒卅三年（西歷一九〇七年），該廠無意經營，乃由華商承盤，更名為啟新洋灰公司。翌年，淸政府繼起創設廣東士敏土廠於廣州。宣統二年（西歷一九一〇年），湖北省亦成立大冶水泥廠，嗣以營業失利，遂於民國三年歸併終啟新洋灰公司，改稱華記湖北水泥公司。歐戰爆發後，外洋水泥輸入絕跡，國內水泥業乃漸呈蓬勃氣象。民國九年劉鴻生君等，發起組織上海華商水泥公司於龍華，成立於同年十二月，决年六月，向前農商部註冊，至民十二年八月開始出貨。繼起者為南京龍潭之中國水泥公司，成立於民國十年八月，同年十一月註冊，十三年蔓出貨；後又收買十二年創設之無錫太湖水泥公司全部機器，並建新廠。十八年，廣東省政府因建築粵漢鐵路，需用大量水泥，乃於廣州附近創設西村士敏土廠。吉林省籌備巳吿就緒之衆志洋灰公司，因九一八專變而突吿中止，嗣後國內新創者，即無所聞。及至最近，聞政府及實業領袖多人，擬在南京組織大規模之水泥公司，並擇定棲霞山為廠址，定名「江南水泥公司」資本為二百四十萬元，不日即將興工建築。倘將來國人能一致提携，則國產水泥，足敷自給，而每年數百萬元之漏巵即可杜塞。</p>
<p>（三）種類及原料　水泥的可分三種：　天然產水泥；　火山頂水泥；　博特蘭水泥。我國水泥廠所產，皆係第三種博特蘭式，本篇所述製造程序，亦即偏於此式。</p>
<p>至於製造水泥之原料，計有三種：　粘土，以不含多分之鐵質及碱質為佳。查上海公司採用之粘土，係採自松江佘山；中國則採自該廠附近。　灰石，以未含鎂或僅含徵量者為宜。上海採用者係來自長興陳灣山；中國則就附近採用。　石膏，我國如廠所用石膏，多向德國漢堡或墨西哥訂賬。查我國湖北應城縣亦有出產石膏，但因品質欠佳，且來源時吿斷絕，致須仰給於外洋·此外如燃料之煤，亦屬重要，各廠需用煤之重量，的合製成品三分之一。廠家所用之煤，多半為開灤，烈山，中興，及紅奇等處之煤屑。中國及上海　廠因距離煤礦較遠，致運費損失不貲：啟新廠則就近採用，故該項成本較低也。</p>
<p>查上海公司全年約需粘土三萬噸，灰石的十萬餘噸，石膏的二千餘噸，中國公司年需粘土的四萬噸，灰石的十餘萬噸，石膏的四千噸；以上二廠共需燃料每年的八九萬噸。（未完）</p>

<h3>昨晚西靑籃球　暨南擊敗東華　延長時間判定勝負　曁南卅六比卅叫勝</h3>

<p>曁南籃球隊、昨於延長時間中、軺鄺耀琊兩擲兩中、以三十六比三十四力挫東華、在西靑會造成五戰五勝之偉績、全賽曁南始終占先、最後因王南珍尹貴仁相繼四决犯規離塲、陣容稍亂、乃為東華所乘、追成三十二比三十二、繼更以二分超出、形勢岌岌、曁後乃憑最後努力、仍獲勝利、然巳煞費苦心矣、</p>
<p>投籃均欠鎭靜　雙方均用各個監視法以利進攻、曁南隊員均年富力强、奔跑傳遞迅速、乃其特長、東華則以智取、故競爭至劇、惟急迫間投籃均欠鎭靜、每奪筐而出、觀眾興奮之餘、不禁為之婉惜、</p>

<p>延長判定勝負　東華於垂敗局面上扳成平手、士氣大振、馮念華於右方竄至籃下、取得二分、一躍而居前導、惜以後係寳　陳祥龍投籃慌張、未能有所作為、反為鄺耀琊連中一球、仍以二分之差敗挫、</p>

<h3>小男孩（一）（二）（七）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>他們於是開始歸家——直是一種希奇的隊伍，因為拂郎先疾馳而去以便將好消息預報他人：唐恩和兔披前道：然後賴司務抱着南恩，他說那是他「有生以來從未見過那麼緊俏的誧蓋」一路向她開玩笑。裴先生不願讓別人抱羅勃，他要自己來，那小傢伙熟睡以後更加淸醒，便立起在裴先生的懷拘裏，歡歡喜事談着，自視為這决事件裏的主角，他母親扶着他前進，不倦地聽他說，「我知道媽爾媽雨是會來的」，或者看他俯着頭去吻她，並且塞一肥碩的黑莓在她的口裏，「因為她采摘了它們專是要獻給她的」。</p>
<p>等他們到大門的甬道時，月亮已經出來，童子們都出來歡呼相迎，於是他們高舉了兩個「亡羊」恍如打了隊仗歸來模樣，將他們安令地置於餐室之內，在這裏那兩個實利主義的小東西却只要求吃晚餐，反輕視了親熱的表示。於是他們就饗麵包與牛奶，，全個家庭的大小人等都環立了儘看着他們。南恩不久巳恢復了精神，現在危險已過，她歷述各種危險的經過，極儘滋味。羅勃似乎已凝神在他的食物上，忽一次放下他的調羹，作哀號之聲。</p>

<h3>兩種舊報紙</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>在下新近整理一具舊書橱，橱角落裏，忽檢得兩種淸季的舊報紙，一共有五六十份，古色古香，別有風味，二者均係旬刋單行本，惜殘缺不全，引以爲憾！</p>
<p>一爲時務報，始創於光緒二十三年六月，館址無從查考，內容分　論說，（餘杭章炳麟新會梁啟起常有著述）　奏摺諭旨，　英文譯編，（譯者爲湘鄕曾廣銓）　東文譯編，（譯者爲日本古城貞吉）　其他，長的一尺，闊的半尺，礬紙鉛印，取價每冊一角五分，全年三十三冊，四元，逢閏加三册，加四角，各省均設分銷處。</p>
<p>一爲昌言報，始創於光緒二十四年七月，館址在英租界大馬路泥城橋旁，內容與時務報相若，不過多一種法文譯編，（譯者爲上海潘彥）無論說，英日文譯者，與上同，章炳麟亦間有著述，取價與式樣，均亦相同。</p>
<h3>一文錢</h3>
<p>— 周光緝</p>
<p>一文錢，誰都知道是一個銅錢，但這裏所記的一文錢的事實，却不比這樣简單，所謂一文錢也者，是大家大商店的招牌，至於怎樣命名爲一文錢的來由，據說是這樣的。</p>
<p>某鎭上，有一個流浪者，爲着找不到職業，就在街上度着沿門托鉢的生活。有一天，在某富人家的牆邊頭踱過，發現那富家人掃出來的灰屑堆巾有一個銅板；還有幾張紅紅綠綠的散紙，他一樣樣的拾起來，買一個銅板的漿糊，把這些紅紅綠綠的紙頭，紥成一些給小朋友頑耍的玩具，到那富人家的門口叫買，所取的代價，是祇有一兩個銅板的，因爲博得小朋友的歡心，每次的主顧，却也不在少數，他從此接二連三的做下去，並且做些其他生意，不到幾年工夫，所積的資本，也就很有可觀了。後來就在那鎭上開了一個頂兒尖兒的廣貨店，而褂一塊招牌叫一文錢，以誌不忘。</p>
<h3>入市</h3>
<p>— 天基</p>
<p>在這裏，我們就可以知道一切事情的成就，都是從一點一滴，日積月累的做起來，所謂「集腋成裘」，「聚沙成塔」，蹬之以上的事實而益信。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣妹集議　虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>他道：遝有一件事情，我們也得預備的。那個姓賈的，對這件事，聽說花了一百多塊錢，假使他要退回聘金，才肯放人，我們也不能完全拒絕。旣不能拒絕，那就要籌備欵項了，這一筆欵項，似乎要大家捐出來才好。他一提到了捐錢，這就把各人的聲浪都壓了下去，有的太太在捧杯子喝茶，有的太太在掏出粉鏡子來，向臉上撲粉。有的同鄰座的太太，交頭接耳的說話。這把發起入倒塞住了嘴，站在那裏，一點辦法沒有。藍夫人是在主席地位坐着的，這就站了起來，向他招了兩招手道：劉太太請坐下罷。至於這一欵項的事，那倒很好辦，我們大家商量着來籌畫就是了。劉太太有了這話，把面子蓋住着，就不怎樣的得難堪了，這就紅着臉坐了下來。藍夫人道：旣是說到捐款，口說無憑的，我就先用張紙來記上罷。於是吿訴茶房，立刻取了一分紙筆墨硯來，自己先行取過，提筆便寫道：藍專員夫人，捐欵，寫到這裏，忽然把筆橫擱下，搖了兩搖頭笑道；我怎好一個人先寫，還是請大家先酌定個數目，然後我來凑尾數。說着，就把紙筆向右邊一移，移到第一位黃太太身邊去。這位黃太太是個胖胖兒的人，穿了一件藍軟緞綢夾衫子，緊緊的縛在那肥猪肉似的身體上，把胸面前肌膚，擠得鼓鼓包包，突出許多層决來。看到了紙筆送到面前，立刻把臉上兩塊肉泡向下一落，表示出一種不慰快的樣子。將一隻帶着金鐲子雪藕似的手，抓起筆來，文不加點的寫着，無名氏捐洋二角。他寫畢，將紙筆向下手一位太太面前移了去。那太太看着，點了兩點頭笑道：這就對了，我們也不必把作好事擺在臉上，寫無名氏就對。於是也跟着後面寫了一行字，無名氏捐洋一角，主席向這兩人看着，作個沉吟的樣子，微笑道：這雖是聽憑各人自由捐助，可是多少總耍凑着像個數目。若是照這樣子寫，恐怕……他兩手按住了桌沿，向全座的人一一看去。（三七九）</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （楊子江）</p>
<p>辰光巳是上午四點半鐘了，冬至以前的白畫總覺短促得很，走過南京路大陸商塲前面，兩旁的商店早巳　炬通明，宛若夜市了。但是有一個黃包車夫却儘在中國國貨公　門前埋怨着。南京路是不准停空車的，空黃包車甚至經過都不被允許，（自備包車例外）兩車夫說：客人進去了巳有半點鐘，呌他在外面等的車錢沒有給，那末等到什麽時候呢？巡捕來干涉又不是好玩的。……</p>
<p>正在他自言自語（就算是向行人的訴苦吧）焦灼得最利害的時候，公司門內却走出來一位新的女主顧，車夫掉頭不顧地拖着走了。他已不耐煩等待上次所拖的車費。</p>
<p>那位好整以　的乘客，即使不是存心賴錢，他也已做了一件負心的事了。</p>
<h3>偶感</h3>
<p>— 止水</p>
<p>書生顚倒說知音，痴絕情懷一往深，我愛定公揮涕語，美人終古屬黃金。一歡能換女兒心，現實移人舉世深。紅拂虬髯俱是妄，鬢霜容易歲華侵：卡爾平生百不售，晚偕燕娌雪盈頭，風雲兒女關緣法，未死童心肯便休。枕戈只簪來爲奴，勞力今猶賤丈夫，此意堂堂誰得會，黃金白骨最相須！</p>
<h3>書事二首</h3>
<p>— 止水</p>
<p>和戰紛紛聚訟頻，纓冠能掃鬩牆塵，濁流無盡靑谿水，欲把黃金鑄黨人，聞道河陽春已非，深深蛺蜨見夢飛，東來敵騎無人問，祇怪橫陳玉體肥。</p>
<h3>秋夜雅集</h3>
<p>— 魏文希</p>
<p>人從閒暇喜風流，午夜高吟樂唱酬，黃葉任隨秋共老，消樽每藉月同浮。卅年江海長爲客，萬古情懷合託鷗，賴有胡牀供嘯傲，城頭何用問更籌。</p>
<h3>木魚小掌故</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>這兒所說的木魚，不是佛堂裏禿禿禿戲着誦經的傢伙，這是江淮間以前很流行的請着客人可望而不可吃的木製魚片。</p>
<p>興（化）東（台）等縣，一般婚喪喜慶之家，欵待賓客，動輒由二三十桌至六七十桌，菜肴之類，至席終，始獻魚，魚與「餘」諧音，賓客預祝主家「吉慶有餘」起見，多留魚不食，習俗相沿，主家雖買大量魚隻，每備而不食，耗費金錢，極不合算，但尊重待客之禮，關於魚之一物，又不可不購備。</p>
<p>此事相傳以來，狡黠之徒為節省金錢起見，乃以木片刻成魚形，　以腮目，調以醬色，與眞魚無區別，木魚待客，十餘年前成爲一種慣常習慣，近日此風已稍殺，蒸眞魚二三碗，欵客數十桌，每桌略一獻示，足可供客而無忤慢之嫌。</p>
<p>木魚盛行時代，常憶有農人至城赴宴，獻至魚時，農人不知禮節，起箸翻撥，硬而不能動，當時極駭異，座客戲對他說：城裏魚沒有鄕裏魚酥爛，我們留待下次吃罷！農人仍不解，對着魚發怔，座客均失笑，離座散去，農人也就糊裏糊塗的走開，後來有人嘲笑怕硬不怕軟的人道：鄕下人吃魚，軟的入肚，硬的不敢下箸，木和尙撞木鐘，木氣太重。木魚待客之風，至今雖歛跡，但是一般人談起此事，仍然要發噱呢！</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>田園風味</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>在這田事巳完，新穀登塲的時候；農人們忙碌了一年，纔可以稍享田園的樂趣了。在這時候，農人們當然也可享用些口腹之奉，新米性糯，菜糧味甜，負曝安享，眞不啻羲皇上人呢。下面幾種食品，都是農家冬季點品，田家風味，確是別有滋味的。</p>
<p>大菜　那田畦上一片靑紫的大菜，經過了濃霜浸潤，滋味是益發甜糯了。這時薪穀登塲，將大菜來煮菜粥，菜飯，那一股香味，巳足引得人口胃大開，健飯加餐。將菜心煮湯，以新米磨粉，做成扁圓的小糰子，下在湯裏煮熟吃，蘇州人呼做，「菜心扁嘴糰子」，菜香粉糯，那種滋味，確比了名貴的點心，要好吃百倍。青菜糊塗麵，加着葷油，那滋味也別擅勝塲，並且這兩點心，都很容易果腹，價廉物美，爲家常的經濟食品。</p>
<p>南瓜　南瓜是很容易繁植的，無論種在何種隙地，都能發榮滋長，家庭裏面，種植在丞着灰的飯籮裏，那籐兒爬到屋上，也能結着巨大的南瓜。南瓜的滋味，是甜甜的，並且也很耐飢，鄕下的窮苦人家，將南瓜成一大塊，一大塊的，在鍋上烹熟，就可代巷飯糧了。蘇州人吃起南瓜來，當然比較考究些，將南瓜削去了皮，切成小小的薄片，起了油鍋，加着水將南瓜煮得爛爛的，成了薄糊，然後將糯米粉做的扁嘴糰，和着同煮，或將麵粉調成糊狀，一匙匙的掏着下鍋且煮且掏，一同煮熟，那麵粉結成一塊塊的麵疙瘩，這種南瓜扁嘴糰，和南瓜麵疙瘩，雖然形狀不見高妙，然而色香味三者，均臻上上，田園風味，原是中吃不中看的。</p>
<p>蘿蔔　冬季蘿蔔，肥得可愛，那味兒也嫩得像水梨一般，在圍爐的冬季，人們的喉嚨，很容易發生腫痛的火症，但常常吃些生蘿蔔，就可解除那種疾病，他的功效，眞比藥物還靈騐些呢。蘿蔔除生吃外，煮成飯菜，也是紅燒白鴿，葷素皆宜。蘿蔔製的點心。共有兩種，一係蘿蔔絲餅，一係蘿絲糰子。將蘿蔔在飯籮的竹絲上磨擦成一絲絲的蘿蔔絲，用麵粉包成搭餅，在油裏汆熱，滋味是很奸的；這種餅，蘇州人呌做「扯直餅」，因爲麵餅是果腹的，蘿蔔却可以消食，麵粉與籮蔔合在一起，恰恰消去，不過將蘿蔔絲作饀，做成蔔子，却並不聽得呌什麼「扯直糰子」了。在冬至節邊，蘇地人家是家家做蘿蔔糰子，把來祭薦祖先，那糰兒有葷有素，都很好吃的。</p>
<p>鷄蛋　豚柵鷄栖，是農村必具的點綴品，鷄在鄕下人家，是差不多家家豢養的，所以鄕下人家，也家家有着鷄蛋，在交通不便的鄕間，到了貴客，他們的點心，當然是一味水波鷄蛋。將水煮沸後，將鷄蛋碎殼下在湯中，俟凝結成熟，放些鹽花，就盛碗供客了。蘇州人家的水波鷄蛋，常然比較講究些，湯是用葷油和好醬油冲成，有時還下着索粉，滋味自然更好了</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>國聯之喪鐘</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>蘇聯報紙最近批評英法對意阿戰爭的所謂和解案，該案係以犧牲弱小，作爲緩和英意帝國在地中海上矛盾的代價，稱之曰「國聯之喪鐘」。國聯之喪鐘，最早卽已敲過，遠在「九一八」日本侵入我國柬北時，繼之以德國退出，與英德間之海軍協定，國聯早經宣吿死亡。而最近英法對意阿戰爭之所謂和解案，內容係英法在東菲的權益上，儘量對意讓步，割讓阿國若干重要土地與經濟利益與意國，以滿足意帝國主義的慾，望使意國早早收束對東菲的戰事，以緩和最近英意帝國主義在地中海上所發生的新的矛盾。</p>
<p>帝國主義在殖民地上一切的矛盾衝突與妥協，無論「花樣翻新」，方式不一，但它們却有一個一致的罪後目的，就是在怎樣的妥協條件下，來一致的分割殖民地。最近英法對意阿戰爭，所謂和解案的才成立，正是說明這一事實是千眞萬確！</p>
<p>現在英法對意阿戰爭的所謂和解案，已經成立，今後的國聯的工作，將不再是用什麽方法來阻止意帝國主義向東非的侵入，而是在英法意三大帝國主義分贓會議之下，來用什麽妥善的方法分割阿比西尼亞，壓平阿國民衆的反帝戰爭。然而全民族一致抗意反帝的阿國民衆，是吾就願意犧牲全民族的利益，屈從於帝國主義的分贓會議之下呢？據電訊，阿王已表示，任何以分割阿國爲條件之和解案，阿國不能接受；阿國决堅持抵抗到底，反對任何對阿國不利的事實，這是怎樣使我們受盡壓迫與侮辱，而併僅僅透一口氣都沒有權利的民衆聽了，是感到了怎樣興奮與慚愧的情緒啊！這個皇帝，是吾値得全阿國民衆的擁戴，和全世界被壓迫者的同情與贊助！</p>
<h3>農村敎育</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>有過一個時候，我帮助我的朋友到一個僻遠的鄉鎭上去敎書。那學校是一所破落的廟宇，大殿就是敎室了，學生呢？在農忙的時候，可以一個都不到校里來，起初我們曾挨戶去勸說，用最淺近的道理對他們的家長聲述讀書識字的重要；但是他們的回答，使我們這一份勇氣完全壓了下去。他們都是善良的入，對於「先生」的光駕到他們家里是認爲無上光榮的，同時又恐懼着他們的子弟或許在校里患了過失，完全像對付催租的地保那樣欵待我們，及至我們聲述了來意之後，他們愁苦了臉，彷彿一架模型似的在各個家長嘴里我們知道了他們的苦衷。他們說現在種田已不是一份好行業了，肥料貴，人工貴，種出來的米却不値錢，又三年兩頭鬧着荒，但是不種田去幹什麽呢！每年希望着有個好收成，大家喝一口薄粥。讀書，——我們知道就是吃了不識字的苦，鄉長要在鎭上閒一所學校，眞是阿彌陀佛，又不要我們一個錢，我們爲什麽不要孩子讀書呢；多識幾個字或許將來可以另外找一份行業，但是兩個孩子可以抵一工，請短工，要工錢，而且要大魚大肉欵待他們，我們那里來的錢呢？要是保證有個好收成倒也罷了……而最後的結語是：「請先生原諒，過了農忙我們馬上叫孩子到校里來。</p>
<p>我的朋友是位敎育家，他放棄了很好的職業到那鄕鎭上去擔任校長，他寫過一封很長信給我，他說：他的這個宏願現在實現了，要普及敎育，應該從這種窮鄉僻隅的地方做起，現在有人供給一點菲薄的經費，祇要我們肯努力做去，或許有出於意外的成績呢。他幷且要求我帮助完成這件功德無量的大事業。我那時候閒在家里，就允許了他的請求</p>

<p>，鼓着勇氣來擔起這件艱苦的工作。當鄉長歡迎我們的時候，在那個大廣場上站滿了全鎮的人，父老們笑着，孩子們跳着，我的朋友曾占到土丘上去大聲地演說，博得那些鄉民鼓掌。當天在鄉長家裡晚膳，他說很高興這裡的鄉民知道識字的重要，他要不怕艱苦，聯合同志，努力做去。但是剛開學上課，就是農忙的時候，學生子一個個少了。奔走遊說一天的結果，他覺悟了，他知道空口說白話的理論在現實的鐵牆當前已顯示牠原形，他知道要普及教育的先決問題了。不過他沒有灰心，他說祗要孩子們來上一天課，就　一天的力吧，至少這一點精神是不會　擲的。</p>
<p>一個學期結束，毫無成績可言，因為讀一天書放三天假，那些孩子們雖然喜歡讀書，但是工作比讀書更吃緊，他們的注意力從書本移到工作上去了。暑假後開學，那應該是農村最空閒的季節，然而我們奔告開學的消息那天，我們帶回來了更痛心的刺激。孩子們的父母要求我們遲幾天開學，說是現在大家空閒下來了，一家數口，不另外找一點工做，就要沒有飯吃的。那些孩子們就挑上了菜筐上街去，或是到樹林去拾柴枝。到晚上，孩子們偷偷地到校里來，在煤油燈下讀幾個字，可是又被他們的父母喊回家，他們要利用這時間來編竹筐，打草繩，敲錫錠。</p>
<p>第二個學期結束，校長先生感到深深的失望了，他到鄉長家裡辭職。在一個大雪的早上，我們跟着腳夫離開那小鎮，一羣孩子穿着單薄的破衣直送我們到船埠頭，他們問着先生明年什麽時候來？朋友含糊地回答了他們，我們像逃犯似的悄悄地走了。——那是四五年前的事了。</p>
<h3>收糧員</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>兩三個荷槍桿子的小锅，跟隨着一個戴氈帽子，穿中山裝的，襟際上邊晃着兩枚閃亮亮的證章，比較斯文的人物。當那一行人大搖大擺開發到這鄉鎮來的時候，有許多必要和這一行人發生關係的農家戶，就像大禍即將臨頭的捏了一把汗。不知怎樣　付地在腳慌手亂着。</p>
<p>「如何是好呢？」每個人都　樣面面相覷着。</p>
<p>老大是鎮靜着，他的經驗曉得怎樣去應付這難關。那就是說，他得在他們未上門來之前，先　　各樣不能避免的東西。於是，那夥人　糾糾地涌到老大的家里的時候。</p>
<p>「老爺們，辛苦啊，好遠的打縣城跑來，請坐，請坐」。</p>
<p>老大已經迎出來，訥訥地笑着說，一面彎下腰給他們作揖。</p>
<p>穿中山裝的把帽子摘下來，老大忙着上前接過來。另後從烟盒里抽出根烟，送上嘴里，老大又忙着拿火柴給他擦燃着。老大的女兒却忙着泡茶，倒滿幾大碗端詳到各人面前。兵士們的槍桿放在腳邊，張開嘴巴，嘓咯嘓咯地把茶水一大口一大口喝下去。</p>
<p>穿中山裝的用着貪婪的眼睛一死兒釘住女兒的臉孔。微微的笑着。兵士們鷹樣的眼睛在掃來掃去，最後却落上擺滿酒菜的　灶上邊。</p>
<p>「老　，用不着我說，你應該識相點，你的　錢已經拖過二季了，這回不管怎樣要交出來的」。</p>
<p>穿中山裝的冷冷的說道，但他的面孔却不是　着老大，　的視線仍然射　老大的女兒的臉龐上，胸脯上。眼眶里充滿了卑鄙的欲念的光芒。</p>
<p>老大用着恭謹的口吻：「是的的是的，老爺，請做做好事，實在不是我故意　　，啊，我里敢這樣，而是年　不好，緩些時，我自己送去老爺官府里去吧，……」</p>
<p>老大的話沒說完，那人已經或了，搶上去叱駡着：</p>
<p>「老烏龜，別瞎扯　蛋，誰高興聽你這一套，一句話，快把錢交出來了事，不然押人？」</p>
<p>但是老大恭恭敬敬地欠伸說道：「老爺先隨便吃點東西吧？」</p>
<p>一邊兒叫女孩子把土灶上的雞呀，魚呀肉的，以及酒一併搬到一隻四方桌子上，請那幾位貴賓入座，老大自己來來去去殷勤地替他們斟酒，一年竭力慫恿大家儘量暢飲，那穿中山裝的更是睜着　滿紅絲筋的眼珠，要吞噬人似的狠狠瞧着他的女兒，一壁嘻嘻哈哈打趣着：</p>
<p>「呃，老大，你這傢伙真有福氣養了這麼一個縹緻的女孩兒，還愁沒法子想麼，傻瓜．．．．．．，」</p>
<p>跟着一陣帶酒腥味的口涎直地啐上老大的臉子，老大應和着苦悶地笑，一邊，他覷着那幾個人有點醉醺醺，便趁機悄悄地走到那穿中山裝的跟前，從口袋里掏出幾隻雪亮銀子仍在他的掌心里，隨後對著士兵們：</p>
<p>「老爺，這是一些兒夫馬費，請收起吧！」</p>
<p>他們一齊滿足地笑開了嘴。</p>
<h3>哀歌</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>年青人是合有秋日的晴空那樣明朗的情操的，燕子般輕挑靈活的姿態的，和完全忘懷憂愁的愉快的笑語的。是啊！年青人是幸福的寵兒，他的一張不染塵世濁流的純扑潔白的心，是最值得去愛戀與擁護的。而我，可憐無端徒負着一付年青的身子，却早就消失了年青人所有的一切。一顆心，在黑暗污穢的氣氛里邊浸透，充滿了人間世淒涼味，成為了苦惱的　　，萎靡地，　又太息地迷着　　的　　籠罩着的慘淡日子，沒有了歡情，沒有了快樂，只是默默地獨酌着喝不完的生之苦酒。生活像一個兇狠無　的裁判官，不許我自由行走一步，　讓它擺佈着。我無言地低首下，而反安然了，因為我知道命運已經給排下一幕永恆的悲劇，雖然青春有如春花一樣的嬌美吧，但我的青春則仿佛種植在不見日光的陰暗中的一株樹，未曾綻開過花朵便寂寂地凋謝了聲音。於是我靜靜地聆着青春落日的　鈴從心坎上踩過去細微的聲音，我沒有一點感覺，因為我瞭然於自己早便為幸福所擯棄的不幸者，我還希冀着什麽呢。縱使有一些幻念，亦是寫在水上那樣渺茫的。對於只是給愁苦悲哀充塞着而　了欣悅的日子，已經發生無涯的倦怠。</p>

<p>程方舟李蓮　毛家書</p>
<p>開篇「紅娘寄書」</p>
<p>一色杏花十里紅。　鶯小姐在閨中。至為兩廂張君瑞。　在閨房繡女工。昨日，紅娘行到西廂去。他說道。張相公有病在床中。意欲前去探望他。只怕親娘家法兇。我只得，寫一封書信通達張君瑞。莫把奴奴掛在胸。即便取出文房寶。十指尖尖把　磨濃。輕輕落筆書成就。圖畫花押疊重重。畫邊剪下了香雲髪。外面還繞紅綠絨那是便把紅娘喚。你與我，將書送與張相公。紅娘奉了千金命。繞過廻廊又轉東。進了柴竹門兩扇。但只說，園中花木色鮮紅。一路花街砌成棋盤式。薔薇花　就錦屏風。喜只喜。白鶴海棠沿街種。老梅生得甚玲瓏。東邊種的芭蕉樹。西邊却有大梧桐。這邊種的千年君子竹。鐵芽松　對大皮松，紅娘是，獨從　仙橋上行將去。但只見，小橋流水響丁東。橋東一帶垂楊</p>

<p>柳。池內荷花色未紅。鴛鴦交頸池　伴。湖內金魚化作龍。紅娘是，再向朱　棚下行將去。只見，繡球花迎面又相逢。桃源洞內有老人峯。玩月亭中觀夜景。白兔時時戲草中。但只見，鴛鴦應造得能奇巧。假山邊種的雞冠老少紅。見一座書房朝南造。裏邊擺設甚精工。居中一隻花梨桌。兩邊六隻細梅公。雲母天然朝外擺。文昌夫子供居中，香几上供隻文昌鼎。速降芸檀透九重。中間掛一幅名人盡。峯法娟妍細又工。一付對聯分左右。綾邊市裱梅箋紅。上聯是，風吹楊柳倏條錢。下聯是，雨打桃花片片紅。看不盡書房多少景。前面已到內房中。行到床前站　定。見書生半倦睡朦朧。氣喘吁吁斜靠交鴛枕。旁邊恰好少琴童。相公啊，奴今奉了千金命。特地前來把信通。張生聽，笑融融。取書即刻便開封。定心仔細從頭看。裏邊寫得甚情濃。自從普救寺中遊一回。與君心下雨情濃。那年，賊兵造亂孫飛虎。家母將我許配兄。蒙君竭力將兵退。白馬將軍意氣雄。萬不料，家母忽地將婚悔。聞君聽說恨無窮。勸君保重身軀爲第一。莫把奴奴掛在胸。但等八月中秋晚。再使紅娘把信通。與君月下訴情衷。</p>

<p>敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「思凡」</p>
<p>小春天氣正溫和。芸房獨坐俏尼姑。輕年落下淸絲髮。暮鼓晨鐘獨守孤。想俗家夫婦如魚水。恩愛情深琴瑟和。女妮想起神魂亂。想迷六賊在心窩。睡朦隴似夢還非夢。俏媒婆。笑含和。穿的綾羅挿帶多。音聲說得姻親就臨期花燭娶奴奴。到夫家扶出參天地。坐床煞帳甚規模。方巾挑起見親夫。飄然一個風流客。儀表堂堂俗氣無。正欲寬衣同衾枕。來了個。金魁金甲佛韋陀。惡狠狠手內執降魔。趕上前來打我夫。嚇醒女妮渾無主。念一聲南無阿彌陀佛。雪多加抵蘇婆呼。</p>

<p>在「週波」看到一篇關於汪曼傑和席與羣的文章，略與事實不符，敝人特為汪席二位更正如下：查得汪席之認識，並非是席自薦廣吿於曼社時。說起來話長，自汪曼傑與韓某合作Kiss避邪片」而獲得「三大歌星」的榮銜，對韓某不免應酬一番。某月，是六月風高張的時候，他們二小無猜地去逛白渡橋公園，在無意中碰到席與羣，席乃韓之好友也。旣然碰到，心裏即使不願介紹，也祇得介紹了。這就是汪席認識的一霎那。至於以後，憑着席的「西裝家常」，和小報廣吿掮客的「噱頭」，就儼然地做起曼社的老闆來，那時候有好多人都呌席與羣爲「席老闆」。後來席老闊不懷好意，轉換目標於社員曼英，，以致醋海風波，打翻了曼社。現在，曼英另有新歡，席老闆思今追昔，覺得還是汪老關好，於是又每天到東方或是利利去望望汪歌星老闆了。某報曾謂寫新聞要拿出眞憑實據來，所以將正確的消息吿訴讀者。</p>
<p>亮社的樂隊一共祗有提琴和鋼琴，而我以爲沒有這二件樂器反而淸靜得多。</p>

<p>電影消息</p>
<h3>「桃花夢」之話</h3>
<p>「桃花夢」，是上海公司出品的國產歌舞片。</p>
<p>在中國電影界目前這困難的環境之下，來攝製歌舞影片，說實話，這實在是一件出力不討好的工作。就攝製過程來說，歌舞片的製作過程最繁重，非有充足精良的物力與人力不可；就電影的敎育性說，歌舞片又常被認爲是一種「毫性的歡樂」。可是歌舞來的受觀衆歡迎却是事實。而且，假如我們不抱定一種固執的成見，那麽，以歌舞影片的形式，片表現一種滴當的內容（例如描寫都市社會的紙醉金迷，暴露有閑階級的糜爛生活，和世紀末人們的瘋狂和沒落）。也有它獨到的長處。爲要使國產電影特巧的多方面的發展，也不妨讓它「聊踏格」吧？</p>
<p>但杜宇君的好像很喜歡製作歌舞片，這一張「桃花夢」，便是他新近的較為滿意的頁獻。</p>
<p>「桃花夢」的主題，是在描寫現代女性的拜金的狂熱，她描寫一羣街頭的流浪的女孩子，怎樣出賣了她們的靑春和美麗，長博得富有者的歡心；一方面，它盡力强調了金錢的魔力，例加跳舞塲中在歡的一景，巨大的銀幣的逃舞，便是絕妙的諷刺手法。——因爲編劇者是用了「夢」來象徴的，因此描寫都糊誇張，有些地方且近乎荒唐，但效果方面，也達到了很高的程度。</p>
<p>飾女孩子的是殷明珠·英茵·倉隱秋·雷夢娜等。殷明珠的艷逸，英茵的健美，倉隱秋的傻勁，雷夢娜的妖蕩，都很合身份，李阿毛所串演的小丑的悲劇，可說是極耐人尋味的地方。</p>
<p>歌舞塲面拍得極好，桃花溪浣衣一幕，數十美貌少女，載歌載舞，眞有天上人間之槪。至於攝影和畫面面的美麗，但杜宇君原是極有名的，可以不必說了。</p>
<h3>「凱歌」中的開壩場面</h3>
<p>一座長約十餘丈，高可六十尺的堤岸，堤的一邊是河流滾滾，風浪滔天的長江。江中漁船點點，巨大帆船東西往來，另一邊則是一望無際的田野、田裏的禾都枯黃了。</p>
<p>這是藝華公司攝製，卜萬蒼導演有聲片「凱歌」中的一大塲面——開壩佈景。同是更是使用百名員工，費時句日，始克搭成的佔地八畝有奇的大工程。</p>
<p>並且，這又是「凱歌」中最吃重的；一幕戲又多。人又衆，大大小小男男女女每天總在七八百名左右，而拍攝迄今也已有八天之久了，尤其是因劇情關係，這衆多的演員，都得赤　裸腿，且又需要流汗，但是這天氣候這麼寒冷，穿綿裘猶有衣單之嫌，不必說是要流汗，祇是赤起膊來，也要凍壞的，後來總算由卜萬蒼想出了一個辦法，即是叫大家提起鐵鋤不停地掘土，而使其自然的一件一件地脫起來，至衣裳完全脫光始正式收入境頭。故數日來，整個　華攝影塲終日只見萬頭攢動千把鐵鋤上下閃爍鏗鏘作聲，光景和空氣確是常的壯觀而緊張了，同時也正是這樣，故所得成績是意外地美滿而有力了。</p>
<p>敢說，「凱歌」中的塲面，無一不雄壯，緊張，偉大，有力的特別是此幕開壩塲面，更是宏偉無比了。不過，我們要明瞭，「凱歌」的有此成績，是多數藝人用着堅固不屈的精神和毅力從困苦中掙扎着始吿成的。</p>
<h3>「春之花」含苞將放</h3>
<p>春是最値得人們留戀的季節，美麗的花朶，象徴着人生的玫瑰色的靑春，「春之花」，這該是個多麽動人的名詞啊！</p>
<p>導演吳邨過去作品的細膩深刻，是早在觀衆們深刻的腦海裹，印有良好的影子，他深寂了好久了，是嗎？你們記掛着這藝人。</p>
<p>現在，他的新作「春之花」已經積極開拍了，這故事裹有熱鬧的跳舞塲，有煩雜的都市住宅，有人類的欺騙行爲的暴露，正眞的伺情互助……描寫北國歌孃的脂粉生活，退伍軍人的沙塲艷史，交織成、片可泣可歌的盡而。人間的悲歡，歌孃的沉淪，盡在這裹一幕幕的展開，如着導演同演員的努力，當這春花開時，須料必可傾倒一時。</p>
<h3>藝聲歲暮號今日出版</h3>
<p>藝聲在目下電影刋物中一致推崇爲最高尙最豐富者，第六期歲暮號已於今日出版，把一極來中國銀壇大事小事及好萊塢形形色色作一年有回味之總結束，處處爲幽默輕鬆的情調攝寫出來，更有「花燭之夜」一文，描寫細膩，極旑旎風光之緻，每本仍售大洋二角云。</p>

<h3>一九三六式英美各廠新車傾向</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>美國注意華麗經濟　英國關心通氣問題</p>
<p>照例。一年一度各汽車廠到了歲尾年頭的時節。新車又要陸績地問世了。每一個車廠。對於來年度的新車。成績好壞。可决定未來一年中營業的成敗。因此一家車廠。對於製造新車。事前都要經過一决詳細的計劃。周密的考慮。不敢馬虎的。時間很快的過去。一瞬眼間。一九三五年又要全部的幻化了。因此。英美各汽車廠。又在忙着計劃新車的製造了。而且有的車廠。一九三六式新車。早已問世。這種新車。雖然沒有運來中國。然而關於英美各車廠。確定製造一九三六式新車的消息。我們確已讀到不少了。</p>
<p>我們先就美國的地屈勞哀汽車大本營說來。每個年頭。在各汽車廠新車快要問世的時候。那些汽車零件製造廠先要勾心鬥角。製造適於新車的零件。所以現在。那些製造廠又在忙着製造一九三六式新車上應用的機器和零件了。允其是零件製造廠。工作的忙碌。竟遠過於往年。秋天過後。在地屈勞哀。有的車廠早已停止製造一九三五式新車。開始計劃一九三六式新車。可是有的在繼續製造一九三五式新車。以供應本年度最後一季的銷路。</p>
<p>在新車季快要來到之前。地屈勞哀這所汽車城中。謠言又在不斷的傳出來了。有人說中價和低價汽車。明年度的新車。構造方面。將不致有多大的改革。但另一面。有入說汽車業在復興運動聲中。幾年來事實上不曾有過重耍的革新。現在汽車業的危機已過。市面又好轉了。所以明年度一般的車廠。預備多費一些錢。大大的改革一下。這兩種傳說。表面上看來似乎有些矛盾。但我們如果仔細一想。也可說都是對的。有的車廠。一九三五式新車已有過重要的改革。那麽一九三六式自然不致再有重大改革了。在反對方面。有的車廠。本年度的新車並沒有多大的改革。明年度的新車。自然要大大的改革一下了。這可算汽車界的一種公式。每個年頭是這樣的。</p>
<p>不久之前。紐的舉行汽車展覽。在這個汽車展覽會中。美國各汽車廠。都有出品參加。新車雖然不多。但我們也可以發現幾種。關於製造方面。一九三六式新車。大致傾向於外觀與經濟兩方面。形式與漆匠方而。力求美觀。而機件的構造。則力使其用油經濟。里程加多，一切裝置。都非常華麗。車身用純鋼製造。軸承改用堅質金屬製成。為了本年度美國各汽車廠。銷數方面。除了低價車之外。中價車也有相當的進展。所以明年度各廠對於中價新車。也預備盡力改革。以冀推廣銷數。</p>
<p>至於英國各車廠。對於一九三六式新車。究竟如何設計。我們所接到的消息。雖比較美國方而少。但有一點重要的改進。至少可為讀者介紹的。那便是通氣問題。汽車上而的通氣。近年萊雖已經過不少改進。但我們坐在任何汽車之中。如果把車窗全部關閉着。總未免要感到一種窒息氣悶的味兒。而且進一步說。這種氣味。更可影響於車中人的身體健康。所以英國的汽車界。近來對於改進通氣問題這一點。非常致力。使車廂的裏面。空氣不但得以充足。而且更是淸潔。裝有一種特殊的空氣淸潔器。換句話說。他們希望汽車裹面的空氣。能够冬暖夏凉。時常充足。一年到頭淸潔。使每個車主感到通氣的良好。而坐在裹面。分外覺得舒適。</p>
<h3>不日到申之新道奇汽車槪述</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>一九三六年式新道奇六汽缸車。不日卽將到申。頃據本埠道奇經售商中國汽車公司總理佛里門氏語人曰。新車宏偉壯麗。較去年出品。且尤過之。其前後車頂部份。重新設計。彌壯觀瞻。座墊及脚架。因採用新法構造及裝配。故共內部益覺寬敞。而車身高度則反較前略低。新車式樣。極新穎美妙動人之至。見者當無不驚奇艷茨。嘆為得未曾有。至其內部裝璜。允極富麗精雅。女界見之。常更讚不絕口。新車內部。旣已極端宏敞。故凡置身其中之乘客與駕駛者。隨意俯仰屈伸。胥可獲得無上安適。關於機械方面。新車所具特色尤夥。按一般車輛。或僅具有新道奇之少數優點而已。其能各新道奇之具有如此美妙式樣。新穎設計。最進步機械工程。與不勝枚舉之經濟特色者。蓋未有也。故新道奇到滬以後之哄動全埠。爲汽車界人士　一致熱烈歡迎。殆可如操左券云。</p>
<h3>一九三六式之新飛霞脫</h3>
<h3>美國汽車製造業現况</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>麥考萊之廣播演說</p>
<p>美國派卡汽車公司總理兼汽車製造商會主席亞汶麥考萊氏。上月初在紐的作無綫電廣播演說。對於美國的汽車製造業近况。言之綦詳。渠並謂一九三六年的美國汽車業從復繁榮。照目下之情况視之。行將一帆風順。無所牽阻。麥氏之演說。於去年美國汽車業之優勢。述說甚詳。而於公路之安全問題。允發揮無遺。渠意對於疏忽之駕駛人及行人。均應採取一種法則以約束之。並稱多數之美國人有時為汽車駕駛人。而又有一時則為行人矣。若於其為駕駛人時責罰之。而在共為行人時則寬縱之。事之不平允。寗有逾於此者乎。</p>
<p>麥考萊氏演詞之一部份大意如次。凡欲在一九三六年購買汽車者實屬大幸。不論其所購者屬於何種價格。必將選得一出色當行之汽車。汽車買主之能以金錢換得貨物之最高價值者。舍目下而外。前所未之有也。汽車製造上之不斷的改進。及令人難以置信之低廉價格。得以製造如是其佳妙之汽車者。業已令汽車業及其附業於恢復繁榮之進行隊中。高據前鋒矣。自汽車業成為世界之重要實業以來。於各業凋零之季。能以一己之幸運。位居百業之冠。一九三五年時又能達於新的高鋒。蓋自一九二九年全紀錄以來。要以本年之產量為最鉅耳。本年所製造之汽車及運貨汽車。其數將屆三·〇〇·〇〇〇輛。卽以此數而言。較之一九三四年已屬高出百分之二十八矣。</p>
<p>汽車實業之活動。對於工人失業者得以複工。在美全國中亦屬解决不少。幾於國中各州咸有其對於汽車製造之供獻也。由直接的或簡攘的。汽車業已令五·〇五六·〇〇〇人得以獲得工作。在許多汽車及配件製造廠中。余願將僱主與傭工。管理者與勞工之運帶關係。略一述說。投資之唯一之希望。乃在以各種努力之下。獲得贏餘。勞工之希裏則在改進其工作狀况。允其注意於酬報之高下。凡此皆某於人類的共同願望。而其意旨甚為良善者也。能令吾人獲得進步及快樂者。舍此二者。又將奚求。在汽車業中之勞工問題。大體皆甚愉快。因雙方能出以互相之考慮。而於人權公理方面又能三致其意焉。汽車製業中之工作狀況。有顯著的良好。對於完整益利之原理。業已立其穩固之基礎。蓋吾等製造商方面並無棄絕之意念。存乎其間此則不得不謂為社會上之一大進步矣。因同人間互相諒解之結果。工人工作狀况之滿意。乃為前此所未有。工資之高竟開各業歷史上之新紀元。卽較之一九二九年亦且過之。鄙意非謂吾等已逹最高之理想的意境。不過顯著之進步業已達到耳。吾等遙矚前途。似一九三六年前途之史將發展。並無若何之阻礙存在　間也。凡事一經發動之後。各種力量卽羣起而聚集。繁樂之恢復。乃係一種事實。共原理亦猶是耳。</p>
<p>美國汽車業去年之進步。其明顯狀態已為人所公認。對於全國之繁榮恢復亦大有助力。但汽車業同人。並不因此自足。對於若干問題。仍在理頭研究。以最大之努力從事進行。其中最重要之一問題。卽為街道及公路之安全是也。多年以來。汽車製造商與國中數百公私團體。對於交通上肇福問題之解决。莫不關心。製造商方面唯一着目之點。卽在令車之本身。其安全方面令與製造時相俱並來。故在汽車本身方而。凡新車及經心處置之車輛。其危險之發生。殆已百不一覩。可謂無懈可聲矣。汽車製造　會又與立法當局及敎育當局。互相合作。俾以有效方面管理此種局面。此中又有一事。不容忽視者。卽於一年之前。本會與哈佛大學之街道交通研究紐互相合作。此種方式。堪稱為解决交通問題之最完整的工作。此項工作之目的。乃汽車製造商會方面擬以研究之所得供獻於各州之政府機關。及民衆團體。俾知防止肇禍。最妥善最有效方法。學理與經騐兩者並重。</p>
<p>欲以一種方法解决整個的交通問題。目下尚未達到此種目的。惟已知之補救方法。如能適當應用。及努力施行。其收效亦殊良好。但最重要者。尚為人的問題。卽駕駛者與行人是也。今國中多處之城市。咸係百年或百年以上之建築。街道狹窄。不適合於近代之交通。其須澈底改造。只有待之異日。有若于城市則於改建之途。已有在開始進行者。但大半城市則尚待進行耳。其他方面亦在同時進行中者頗多。尤以今日吾人所用之汽車。其安全上之設計。可謂已盡人類能力之能事。所須切實注意者祇有一端。卽凡不經心之疏忽駕駛者。不能辭其咎耳。不過行人方面亦宜加以切實之的束。而此種的束乃為保謢其本身之益利計。蓋欲以血肉與鋼鐵相敵。盡人而知其難能也。美國汽車駕駛者。有時亦卽為行人。兩者之間當無敵視行動。惟因其駕駛時之疏忽而責罰之。及其為行入時則寬縱之。此則似非平允之道也。</p>
<h3>用車者冬令須知</h3>
<p>— 方進鷺</p>
<p>一到冬天。大槪一般車主以為加點酒精或其他防凍劑之類的東西在水箱內。以及在水箱外面罩上一個水箱套子便算了事。豈知冬天裹的汽車要注意的不僅就是上面所說的兩件事。還有其他更重要的呢。現在約略揀比較重要的幾點。列舉如後。以作參考。</p>
<p>當踏動馬逹起動引擎的時候。同時亦將接合器（俗稱克拉子）踏下。如此可使傳力盒內齒輪因接合器與引擎脫離而不致轉動。同時引擎本身卽减輕負荷。轉動較易。這麼蓄電池的電流可以節省輸出。而引擎起動亦比較容易。</p>
<p>如果引擎並不立刻發動。勿將阻風（俗稱翟風）。拉出。假使引擎轉了幾轉以後仍不發動。那麼將馬逹開關放鬆。稍停片刻。讓巳經吸入汽缸裏的汽油略為蒸發後。遂後再踏動馬達試動之。</p>
<p>切勿「空馳轉」引擎去使牠溫熟起來。因為無論何種情形之下。「空馳轉」引擎是很不好的。尤其是引擎在冷的時候更壞。</p>
<p>欲使引擎溫熱起來。最好將火頭撲晚而徐徐加速。但不可過速。</p>
<p>除非車上已裝好水箱套或溫度調節器之類的束西。在起動引擎的時候。最好在水箱的前而覆一塊可以捲動的東西。如厚布之類。如此可使引擎溫熱較易。如果是用水箱套的。那麼須將水箱的下半面遮住。水面的上半面露出。水箱的下半部內是冷水。特別是在用熟流法引擎的水箱。往往上半部的水巳是溫熱了。而下半部的水。尚有冰凍的危險。</p>
<p>用幾張硬紙板放在引擎蓋的裹面去遮住蓋上通氣的氣洞。可以使坐在車裏的入覺得非當溫暖。同時引擎工作亦能更臻完美。</p>
<p>檢查發動機的充電率。在冬天最好將充電率略為放大。因為從蓄電池供給出的電量往往較暑天時需大</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>如果水箱內加下了防練劑或者蓄電池內加下了蒸溜水以後。須將引擎轉動十幾分鐘。庶幾冷却系裹的防練劑和水。或蓄電池裹的蒸溜水與硫酸可以藉此妥爲混合而不致冰凍。</p>
<p>萬一遇引擎發生過熱而使水箱內的水沸騰的時侯。掀去水箱蓋子須特別當心。因爲若有滾水從加水口內騰出。令使車上的漆色受損而留痕跡。</p>
<p>潤滑油須較暑天調換更勤。大多數的車子冬天須用薄油。但總須遵照製造廠所薦舉的幾種油爲是。</p>
<p>關於化汽器的混合料這一椿事。最好到你所買汽車的經售行家去詢問。叫他們替你調準。因爲冬天的化汽器燃料多少須得調準得濃點。關於這一層。作者認爲切自己輕於嘗試。因爲如果調準得太濃厚。會使汽油過度消耗。如果太稀薄或不够濃厚。會使引擎工作無力。所以這適度濃厚的混合燃料的調準。缺乏經騐的人是全無把握的。</p>
<p>凡是遇到引擎過熱的時候。切勿突然將冷水加入水箱內。因爲假使這樣。汽缸蓋或汽缸水套驟然遇到冷水。將有破裂的危險。正當的方法須讓引擎徐徐冷下。直至手可以放在汽缸蓋上而不致燙痛。遂後將水加下。假定是一架裝有水帮浦的引擎。發生過熱。而水箱內尙有水剩下則讓引擎徐徐冷下以後。再發動引擎。使牠轉動甚慢。遂後把水徐徐加入水箱。這時。因爲引擎轉動着。水帮浦便撥動水流。使之流動循環不息。而引擎亦不致受到意外損壞。</p>
<p>凡是用酒精作防凍劑的引擎。假使發見從水箱內的溢水管裹噴出蒸氣以後。須立刻將引擎停止。這種蒸氣爲害甚大。牠能使水箱裹的水漸漸都從溢水管內逃出。直至水箱的水流空爲止。於是汽缸損壞。活塞燒壞。以及一切因引擎過熱。而致難以修理的病症將隨之發生。這一點異常重要。須特別注意之。</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Government's Responsibility to the People</h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>The transformation of national destiny and the merits and demerits of politics, in this period of political tutelage, lie in a single thought of the officials in power. One thought for good will plant a good cause, and one thought for evil will reap a bad consequence. On the day of his inauguration, President Chiang exhorted his colleagues, "Those of us who serve the government must know that every thought and every action is related to the safety, security, joy, and suffering of the people." These words are sufficient to express the highest recognition of their responsibilities by those in power. Our people have suffered for a long time, and they hope that someone will bring relief. The authorities must have the suffering, joy, safety, and security of the people in mind in every thought and action so that they will not be unworthy of being a government of the people. Moreover, if the government can value the suffering and joy of the people, the people will naturally care about the difficulties and dangers of the government. If they are of one mind and one heart and work together to save the country, with sincerity, even metal and stone can be penetrated. Then what is there that cannot be done?</p>
<p>The corruption of officialdom is due to the evil of officials. The emergence of evil officials is due to the lack of clarity of right and wrong and the failure to impose penalties. The success of the Northern Expedition was also based on the call to build a clean government. However, the officialdom has not yet been cleaned up, and the assessment may not be thorough enough. In the future, if the excellent public officials can be guaranteed and the incompetent ones are not tolerated, so that virtuous officials are happy to serve themselves and the unscrupulous ones are encouraged to do good, it is the key to cleaning up the officialdom. However, to make up for the shortcomings of the authorities' ears and eyes, there is still room for deliberation and improvement in the current system of supervision and discipline.</p>
<p>In recent years, all localities have been talking about construction. Construction is indeed good, but it should take into account whether the people and finances can afford it. Natural disasters are frequent, and the people are exhausted and the finances are depleted. They do not have the time to recuperate and rehabilitate. If they do not ask about the urgency and needs and only focus on construction, it is close to seeking merit and praise. Now the government wants to start by revitalizing productive industries and take the actual benefit to the people's livelihood as the standard for economic construction, which can be said to be getting to the point. Today's China is suffering from a lack of production, not a lack of enjoyment. The poverty of the people and the exhaustion of finances have reached their extreme. If they do not practice frugality, do not add scrutiny, and only seek construction in form, the disaster cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Only with clear internal affairs can there be a way to deal with foreign affairs. This is what the government can do, and this is what the people expect from the government.</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Nanjing The Ministry of Education telegraphed the principals of universities in Beijing on the 17th, urging them to earnestly persuade the students to return to normal as soon as possible, and not to cause unexpected incidents in this extremely dangerous environment, so as to endanger the existing hopes and status of the educational community in Beijing.

(Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Beijing Song Zheyuan issued a letter to the students on the 17th, which reads as follows: "Recently, students from various universities have been petitioning everywhere. If its meaning is a pure patriotic movement, it is sympathized by the society and admired by Zheyuan. However, according to reliable reports, there are quite a few communists in the student groups. Most of the pure students are deceived and instigated by the communists, and used as tools, which is regrettable. Zheyuan's thorough anti-communist attitude has long been hated by the communists, and it is expected that they will take the opportunity to act. However, most students should recognize the conspiracy of the communists and the right way to save the country, and make rational distinctions to avoid superficial and blind following. Since the Chahar Political Affairs Committee is ordered by the central government, it is naturally necessary to establish it. Zheyuan is a soldier and is not good at politics. However, for the sake of the country and the people, he is unwilling to lag behind. All measures are based on the interests of the entire country and will not be affected by the propaganda of a few communists. Finally, I hope that all students who understand the overall situation and know the righteousness should immediately wake up, concentrate on their studies, and stop running around for nothing. If a few communists still act out of line, Zheyuan will take appropriate measures to maintain order and stabilize people's hearts." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Nanjing An official in charge of the Ministry of Education replied to a reporter, saying that the Ministry has two points regarding the patriotic movement of students in Beijing: first, the principals of various schools are responsible for earnestly dissuading them; second, it is hoped that the authorities in Beijing will try their best to avoid drastic methods and adopt peaceful methods to deal with it. Today, the Ministry of Education has learned that the authorities in Beijing quite agree with this idea. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Beijing Students from major middle schools in Beijing did not take any action on the 17th.

(Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Nanjing The faculty and staff of various universities in Nanjing expressed their sympathy for the student petition in Beijing on the 16th. However, they believed that suspending classes and marching would not only waste their studies, but also go against the right track of the nation's long-term struggle. It is heard that they immediately telegraphed the students of major middle schools in Beijing to dissuade them, and also earnestly warned the students of the capital's schools not to take actions such as suspending classes and marching, so as to value their studies. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Beijing This morning, Beijing was calm. There were still military police guarding all the important places, but there were no demonstrations or parades. The number of missing students is quite large, including a 19-year-old girl. The fate of these people is particularly worrying. Whether they were injured or arrested is still unknown. There is no news from the police. The police's severe behavior towards the demonstrators yesterday was criticized by the general public. According to the investigation, excluding the missing, more than 100 students were beaten by the police yesterday, but no one was killed. Twenty-two students are being treated at Xiehe Hospital, but 19 of them left the hospital after being bandaged. Two more were discharged this morning, leaving only one in the hospital, whose injuries are not serious. Other injured people were sent to other hospitals for treatment, but most of them were diagnosed and treated by school doctors. Most of them were injured by broadswords and batons. Two missing students have now been found. They were both beaten and hid in Taoist houses to avoid the police's ferocity. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Beijing Those who witnessed the methods used by the police today to disperse the student demonstrations unanimously condemned them as inappropriate. A reporter from the North China Daily News saw the police in front of the gate appear completely panicked and fire guns at the students' heads at will, and press their firearms, rushing around in all directions, endangering pedestrians. Fortunately, none of the students or bystanders were hit. At the time of the shooting, no police officer was present. The reporter met a coolie from the police station arguing with a student leader and advised the people not to move forward. When the officer came to the scene, he held open-air negotiations with the students. The reporter met with the police who claimed that they were not allowed to enter the front gate because the students shouted slogans against autonomy. When the students marched in formation along the street towards the front gate, they were very orderly, so the police's behavior seemed even more unreasonable.

<h3>Shang Zhen Has Abandoned Plans to Go Abroad; No Clear Indication of Whether He Will Go to Henan</h3>
<p>Baoding: After various parties sent telegrams of consolation and urging regarding Shang Zhen's new position as Chairman of Henan Province, it is reported that he has abandoned his plans to go abroad.

Then, he will go to Zhengzhou to meet with Liu Zhi, or go to Nanjing to meet with President Chiang of the Executive Yuan to report everything before deciding whether to take office as Chairman of Henan Province.

<h3>United States Continues to Purchase Silver; London Silver Market Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Washington: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated this morning that the Treasury Department is still purchasing silver in various places. The reason why the Treasury Department did not enter the silver market on Saturday and Sunday was due to time differences and most markets being closed for half a day. As for whether the Treasury Department will continue to suspend silver purchases on Saturdays and Sundays in the future, the Treasury Secretary declined to comment. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Washington: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that the U.S. Treasury Department is still purchasing silver in markets around the world and that, unless Congress approves a bonus for veterans or other large cash expenditures at the next session, the Treasury Department's existing $2.2 billion is sufficient to cover all expenses until next spring.

<h3>Laval Defends Peace Plan in French Parliament, Radical Party Discusses Whether to Continue Support</h3>
<p>Paris - French Premier Laval delivered a lengthy speech in the Chamber of Deputies this morning defending the Anglo-French peace plan, stating that he had reached a compromise with Britain and had done everything possible to prevent the danger of war from spreading to Europe. He supported the British plan and intended to adhere to a policy that best suited his conscience. The actions of Britain and France were entirely free, and both countries were acting in concert with the League of Nations. Laval then answered questions with fervor, saying that everyone talks about peace, but he serves peace. Before the Italo-Ethiopian war, Britain and France had agreed not to impose military sanctions or adopt plans that might lead to a naval blockade. During discussions with Italian representatives before the war, he expressed a desire for the strictest sanctions to be implemented only if mediation efforts failed and Italy went to war. Laval then described the sanctions already implemented against Italy, saying that they were fulfilling significant international obligations with pain because on January 1st of this year, they had just concluded a treaty of friendship with a nation whose soldiers had fought alongside French soldiers on the battlefield. He continued regarding the peace plan, saying that some might say that Britain and France had agreed to find a reward for the aggressor, but they were only fulfilling their mission to the League of Nations. Laval ended by asking if those who attacked the peace plan wanted to recklessly impose all kinds of sanctions and risk a European war. It is heard that Laval will ask the Chamber of Deputies to vote on a vote of confidence in the government this afternoon before departing for Geneva. The Radical Socialist Party is currently meeting to resolve whether to change its policy of supporting Laval. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London - When the House of Commons debates the Italo-Ethiopian situation on Thursday, opposition leader Attlee will introduce a motion of censure, demanding that the government revoke the terms of the Anglo-French peace plan. The motion of censure has already been submitted to the House, stating in essence that the terms proposed by the government as a basis for resolving the Italo-Ethiopian war constitute a reward for the aggressor, destroy collective security, violate the aspirations expressed by the people, and contravene the spirit of the League of Nations. Therefore, the House of Commons demands the immediate revocation of these terms. Representatives of the National Labour Committee, the Labour Congress, and the Parliamentary Labour Party met today before drafting the motion of censure and passed a resolution firmly rejecting the peace plan, urging the League of Nations to effectively implement sanctions, refuse to recognize the act of aggression, and not base a resolution on the sacrifice of any part of Abyssinia. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London - It is rumored that there will be a cabinet reshuffle in Britain and that Foreign Secretary Hoare may resign because responsible members of Parliament no longer trust the Anglo-French peace plan before the authorities explain it in the House of Commons on Thursday. The cabinet will not have the issue of endorsing the Foreign Secretary's actions, and Prime Minister Baldwin will defend the Foreign Secretary if necessary. The majority of MPs who support the government still oppose this plan, but they feel that the Prime Minister's confusing actions must have good reason. It is widely believed that the authorities will inform the House of Commons on Thursday that Italy intends to consider the oil embargo an act of war, and Britain has been unable to confirm that other members of the League of Nations will take the necessary collective action to uphold the League of Nations' policy. At that time, the House of Commons may not take a very harsh attitude towards the government. Britain has never undertaken actions other than collective action, and if cabinet members are not certain about the possibility of an oil embargo, they can of course take the next best approach, which is to strive for reconciliation.</p>
<p>During questioning in the House of Commons yesterday, Cabinet member Eden was repeatedly grilled by the opposition party, especially by Labour's Dalton. Eden calmly replied in a very calm manner, asking MPs to wait for the full statement on Thursday. In Dalton's question, there was a phrase "the government is still responsible for this shameful plan." The Speaker said that the word "shameful" was inappropriate and rebuked Dalton slightly. The Speaker also said that some of the adjectives used by other Labour MPs in their questions were inappropriate and regrettable. Labour MP Settle asked whether the government still abided by the declaration made by Eden in Parliament on December 13, namely that the indispensable condition for any resolution of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute was that the solution must be compatible with the League of Nations Covenant. Eden replied, "Yes." Settle said, "Is Mr. Eden also aware that the people of the country are satisfied with his answer?" Eden replied, "He hopes that the people of the country are very satisfied with all his answers." The audience burst into laughter upon hearing this. Eden will not attend the debate in the House of Commons on Thursday because he must depart this afternoon for Geneva to represent the British government at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on Wednesday. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Hoare Returns to London Ill, Baldwin and Others Visit</h3>
<p>Although Foreign Secretary Hoare was advised by doctors to rest for a few days to recover his health after returning to London yesterday, it is said from reliable sources that Hoare will attend the House of Commons debate on the Anglo-French peace plan on Thursday despite his illness. The cabinet met this morning, but the Foreign Secretary was absent because he was in bed at the doctor's orders. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain visited Hoare's residence this morning for an hour, then drove back to Downing Street to attend the cabinet meeting to prepare for Thursday's debate. The cabinet meeting lasted for an hour and a half. Prime Minister Baldwin and Chamberlain and Eden met with Hoare after the cabinet meeting. Eden is about to depart for Geneva. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Eden Departs for Geneva to Attend League of Nations Executive Council Meeting</h3>
<p>London - Minister without Portfolio Eden departed for Geneva at 2:00 PM to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. It is generally believed that the instructions Eden carries with him are to act in accordance with the attitude previously adopted in the Committee of Eighteen, in other words, to present the Anglo-French proposed solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute as a basis for peace negotiations and to allow the Executive Council to reject or revise it. It is also heard that the British government will accept any procedures advocated by the League of Nations without reservation. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting to Decide Policy to Deal with House of Commons Debate</h3>
<p>London - The Cabinet convened an emergency meeting today to decide on a concrete policy regarding the Italo-Ethiopian case. First, to ensure that the Cabinet's views are consistent; second, to decide on how to deal with the House of Commons debate on the Anglo-French peace plan on Thursday; and finally, to decide on Britain's relations with France and Italy and its actions within the framework of the League of Nations. (National News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>London - Members of the Cabinet held talks today in preparation for tomorrow's cabinet meeting, which lasted until late at night. Foreign Secretary Hoare arrived here this afternoon from Switzerland and spoke with Prime Minister Baldwin on the phone for a long time after returning to his residence. According to reports, there are two tasks for tomorrow's cabinet meeting: 1. The government will deliver a speech to defend the Anglo-French plan to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute when the House of Commons meets on Thursday to discuss it. This speech should be determined in advance. 2. The policy that the United Kingdom will adopt in Geneva in the future should be formulated. According to parliamentary sources, there are two points that the government intends to explain to the House of Commons: One is that the current situation does not seem favorable for expanding the scope of sanctions and implementing an oil embargo; second, if the member states of the League of Nations are unwilling to jointly assume responsibility in the Mediterranean, then the British Navy should not be solely responsible. As for the situation in the House of Commons on Thursday, it is now known that the opposition party does not intend to introduce a formal motion of censure, contrary to the government's expectations. If they did, the young Conservative members of Eden's faction would publicly disapprove of the government's foreign policy, and the government's great authority would be shaken. Under these circumstances, the government is not willing to show weakness, so it has decided to raise the issue of confidence itself, which can be used to rectify party discipline and make some dissenting members of the Conservative Party feel difficult and have to consider their future political position. Therefore, it is generally believed that when the government raises the issue of confidence, only the opposition party members will vote against it. In addition, the Foreign Office believes that the League of Nations Executive Council will not vote on the Anglo-French peace plan at its meeting on the 18th but will abandon the vote, which is the same as not deciding. In general, the Executive Council will appoint a mediation committee to negotiate with the governments of Italy and Ethiopia to seek a reconciliation plan that takes into account the various proposals previously made. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Cabinet will decide on the issues of maintaining sanctions and implementing the oil embargo at its meeting tomorrow and formulate instructions to be taken by Eden to Geneva to attend the Executive Council meeting. It is expected that what Eden will explain in Geneva will be that since the implementation of sanctions, Britain has been in a dangerous military position, and the risk of military action should be jointly borne by all member states, which is no different from the principle that sanctions should be taken collectively. For this reason, Eden will ask the member states to immediately explain what measures they will take in terms of land and naval forces for the sake of sharing military risks. If their answers are inconsistent, then Britain will not be able to insist on expanding the scope of sanctions and implementing the oil embargo. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Tonight, it is widely rumored here that both Minister without Portfolio Eden and Foreign Secretary Hoare will submit their resignations due to dissatisfaction with the solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Political figures believe that Prime Minister Baldwin will make every effort to avoid a cabinet reshuffle and will definitely succeed, but by January next year, there should be significant changes to the current cabinet lineup. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Laval Denies Using Cunning Against Britain, Expresses Indignation at Outside Rumors</h3>
<p>Premier and Foreign Minister Laval will test the strength of his peace plan at tomorrow's cabinet meeting, facing opposition from Minister without Portfolio Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, who has said that he will use his position to fight against the impropriety of the plan. However, observers say that a cabinet reshuffle may be avoided. It is said that Laval will explain that he and British Foreign Secretary Hoare only drafted some proposals to maintain peace to see if the relevant parties could accept them. As for Geneva, Laval will face a more serious test on Wednesday, when the League of Nations Executive Council meets. The Soviet Union, Mexico, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Turkey, and other countries all oppose the plan. If the Executive Council votes, the opposition will be in the majority. London rumors say that Laval used cunning to get Hoare to agree to his peace plan. Laval was very angry when he heard this. Today, he is prepared to deliver a temporary speech in the Chamber of Deputies to defend his recent actions and try his best to deny the rumors from London. According to London sources, Hoare's agreement was due to Laval's two resolute threats. The first was Laval's claim that he had been entrusted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to declare that an oil embargo would be tantamount to war. The second was Laval's statement that the French fleet could not resist submarine attacks, so the responsibility for defending the Mediterranean for the League of Nations had to be borne solely by Britain. Furthermore, the London Times stated regarding the proposal in the peace plan to specifically designate an area in Ethiopia to connect with the Italian colony of Eritrea and Somalia that the railway from the Ethiopian capital to Djibouti had not been bombed by Italy because of a secret agreement between France and Italy, the exchange condition being this area. Laval was also extremely angry about this statement. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Ethiopian Emperor Expresses Unwillingness to Reward Italy for Third Aggression, But Also Willing to Promote Peace</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa - In an interview with the Reuters correspondent at Taissy today, the Ethiopian Emperor declared that even if the Anglo-French peace plan to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian war is accepted in principle, it would be an act of cowardice against his people and a betrayal of the League of Nations and all countries, because they all believe that the collective security system can be relied upon in the future. The Ethiopian Emperor also firmly stated that he is willing to facilitate the progress of any method of dispute resolution, but a solution based on the Anglo-French proposal would allow the aggressor and the violator of international treaties to succeed. A communiqué issued by the Ethiopian government stated that the Anglo-French plan proposes that Ethiopia cede a whole piece of land to the aggressor, which would only encourage Italy to make a third attempt to conquer Ethiopia. As for the proposal to establish a colonial area in southern Ethiopia, it is even worse than mandated territories because in all mandated territories, the interests of the local people are protected and foreigners enjoy equal treatment. The Ethiopian government is convinced that the League of Nations Executive Council will not accept the plan. At the same time, it is heard that the Ethiopian government has sent a draft reply to the peace terms by telegram to the Ethiopian delegation in Geneva. It is widely believed that the reply will reject the plan, but not with a firm rejection. The reply expresses the Ethiopian government's view that the plan is largely based on the Tripartite Agreement of 1906, which has not been recognized by Ethiopia. The document also declares that the peace terms violate the spirit of the Franco-Ethiopian Treaty of 1909, which recognizes that foreigners in Ethiopia have equal rights, but the proposal to establish a colonial area in southern Ethiopia gives exclusive rights to Italy.

<h3>Italian Ambassador Visits Britain and France Separately, Proposes Several Amendments, Britain Makes No Reply</h3>
<p>Paris - According to well-informed sources, Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti informed French Premier Laval last night that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is willing to make the following amendments to the Anglo-French peace plan:</p>
<p>*   The holy city of Axum should belong to Italy.</p>
<p>*   Although Ethiopia is allowed to use the port of Assab, the management rights of the port should still be held by Italy.</p>
<p>*   All concessions enjoyed by foreigners in the Italian colonial area in southern Ethiopia should be completely abolished.</p>
<p>*   Italy must enjoy full police power in that area. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London - Italian Ambassador Grandi visited Sir Vansittart, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, this afternoon, and the two sides talked for half an hour. It is heard that the Italian Ambassador's visit was to request further clarification on the Anglo-French plan to resolve the dispute, but according to news from Rome, the Italian government now intends to propose a counter-proposal as follows:</p>
<p>*   The Italian colonial area proposed in the original plan should be extended westward to the border between Ethiopia and British Sudan (the original plan was westward to 35 degrees east longitude).</p>
<p>*   Italy should delineate an area in Eritrea for Ethiopia to build a seaport, and it is not appropriate to give it the port of Assab.</p>
<p>*   Italy should be allowed to build a railway in the colonial area proposed in the original plan to connect the port of Massawa in Italian Eritrea through the west of the Ethiopian capital.</p>
<p>*   Ethiopia should grant Italy economic concessions in the Harar province.</p>
<p>*   The holy city of Axum in the Tigray province should belong to Italy so that the church elders in the city who surrendered to the Italian army will not be retaliated against by the Ethiopian government.</p>
<p>Political figures here believe that if this counter-proposal is true, its intention is to test the opinions of Britain and France. If Italy really has these demands, the British government will definitely reject them resolutely, and Prime Minister Baldwin may even take the opportunity to withdraw the original plan. However, people in the Foreign Office say that if Italy makes further demands, Britain will definitely not accept them.</p>
<p>According to news obtained by the London correspondent of the Paris Echo, the first two points of the Italian counter-proposal are the same as above. The third point is more detailed, stating that Italy requests to build a railway west of the Ethiopian capital, in accordance with the Anglo-French-Italian Agreement of 1906 and the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1925, to connect Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>London - In order to obtain more detailed information about the Anglo-French peace plan to report to the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party, Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi had a half-hour meeting with Sir Vansittart, Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office, yesterday. Grandi raised many questions, but Vansittart did not answer them, only taking notes of the questions for reference. The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party has scheduled a meeting tomorrow to consider the Anglo-French peace plan. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Italy Will Postpone Reply, Concerned About Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>According to what our correspondent knows, the Italian government has decided to postpone submitting a reply to the Anglo-French peace plan due to concerns about the development of the diplomatic situation. Although the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party is scheduled to meet tomorrow, because the British House of Commons and the French Chamber of Deputies will start diplomatic debates in the coming days, the outcome is still unknown. Therefore, the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party may not immediately make a decision on the Anglo-French peace plan. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Rome Communiqué Admits Ethiopian Troops Have Made Successful Advances</h3>
<p>Rome - A communiqué was issued here today admitting that Ethiopian troops have made successful advances. It is said that 3,000 Ethiopian troops on the Northwest Front attacked Italian troops. After fierce resistance by the sentries of the Eritrean mixed troops in the Italian army, they retreated along the area near the Metemehitt ravine and the Tacazze River. At the same time, another regiment of Ethiopian soldiers crossed the river downstream in an attempt to encircle the Italian troops in the Sel area. The people in that area have recently surrendered to the Italian army. As a result of the Ethiopian army's advance, a major battle has started between the two sides and is currently underway. The Italian army has aircraft and armored vehicles to assist them. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Moscow Newspaper Criticizes Anglo-French Proposal, Violates Covenant and Encourages Aggression</h3>
<p>Moscow - An editorial in the French-language Moscow Daily criticizes the Anglo-French "Paris Plan," saying, "What Italy has failed to achieve with its weapons, it must now rely on its powerful neighbors such as Britain and France to oppress Abyssinia to obtain. Therefore, Britain and France have become participants in Italy's aggression." The newspaper points out that when Geneva received this compromise proposal, it was the time to consider sanctions. "The intention of sanctions is to allow Ethiopia to have assistance in the unequal conflict with Italy to offset Italy's military force. But now it is not the case. They are suggesting that the League of Nations provide assistance to Italy. In this way, Ethiopia will not only succumb to Italy's material oppression, but also to the League of Nations' spiritual oppression. If the League of Nations Executive Council does not want to destroy the League of Nations' authority and existence, then there is no doubt how it will respond to this proposal."</p>
<p>"If Britain and France are acting purely in their individual capacities and are willing to end the Italo-Ethiopian war early for some reason, this is still understandable. What is unfortunate is that the drafters of this proposal falsely claim that they are doing it on behalf of the League of Nations. Therefore, the League of Nations Executive Council must first expose this pretense, pointing out that the League of Nations organization has never authorized Britain and France to assist an aggressor. The Executive Council must declare that it has absolutely no connection with the Paris Plan."</p>
<p>"Secondly, Article 10 of the Covenant guarantees the territorial integrity and inviolability of each member of the League of Nations. The League of Nations Executive Council should remind the countries that drafted the proposal of this point again. If the Paris Plan is recognized even slightly, it will force Ethiopia to assist the aggressor. In this way, it will not only harm Ethiopia's independence but also threaten the life of the League of Nations. Among the members of the League of Nations, except for those who have always oppressed the League of Nations spiritually and now want to oppress the League of Nations materially, there is no doubt that they will fully agree with the above views. Strictly speaking, the League of Nations Executive Council cannot accept the Paris proposal unless it has been agreed to by the belligerent countries. The League of Nations Executive Council cannot consider the Paris proposal or other proposals before Ethiopia has expressed its acceptance."</p>
<p>"If the League of Nations Executive Council agrees to this proposal that satisfies Italy's greed, then the League is finished. Newspapers all over the world say that if the League of Nations acts in this way, it will be subsidizing an aggressor. It will not only encourage the aggression of other belligerent countries, but Italy will also take further steps in aggression. If Italy can win the war (the Paris Plan allows Italy to have a huge victory), then it must join the ranks of aggressor countries in the future, oppose the League of Nations, oppose the collective security system, oppose the consolidation of peace, and attempt to launch new wars."</p>
<p>"It would be a big mistake if we say that the contradiction between Germany and Italy makes them unable to cooperate absolutely. If they can help each other and encourage each other to engage in aggression, then the obstacles may not be removed. Japan continued to attack after occupying the entire Manchuria, and Italy will do the same. It is not reprehensible to want to end the Italo-Ethiopian war early. To some extent, all countries have participated in sanctions, and the situation on the other side of the world is gradually maturing. All friends of peace are paying close attention to this. They also want to get rid of the pain that the Italo-Ethiopian conflict has brought them. However, what is said above has not proved that the proposal to destroy the League of Nations (which is the most recent tool for consolidating peace) is reasonable. If it is like this, it will greatly hinder peace and allow it to be true under the current serious situation. We firmly believe that when the League of Nations Executive Council is forced to approve the Paris proposal that destroys the Covenant, its responsibility will be what." (TASS, 16th)</p>

<h3>Britain to Increase Taxes, Restrict Imports of Foreign Eggs, Proposals of the British Agricultural Production Improvement Association</h3>
<p>London - The special committee on improving the egg production industry recently released a report, which advocates increasing the import tax on fresh eggs imported from outside the British Empire by six pence per 120 eggs. In other words, the import tax on foreign eggs (ad valorem tax) will be increased from 20% to 25% or 30%. One-quarter of this tax revenue will be used to subsidize the domestic egg production industry. In addition, the report also advocates storing domestic spring-produced eggs in moderation for autumn use and limiting the quantity of foreign eggs imported in the spring so that supply and demand are compatible. After the report was released, the Daily Telegraph commented in particular, paying attention to the increase in the import of liquid egg products in recent years. It is said that the quantity of liquid egg products imported has doubled in the past ten years. The quantity imported last year accounted for one-eighth of the national consumption, most of which came from China, but most European continental countries are dissatisfied with the manufacturing and packaging of Chinese products and mostly prohibit their import. As far as Britain is concerned, the domestic manufacturers use this liquid egg product, so even if the import tax on fresh eggs is increased, it will not have the slightest impact on the import of liquid egg products, frozen eggs, etc. Therefore, the newspaper believes that the move to increase the fresh egg tax is not a correct solution, and the reasons listed in the above-mentioned committee report are insufficient to prove that this move is necessary.

<h3>Chinese Art Inspires World Fashion</h3>
<p>London - The International Exhibition of Chinese Art has had a real impact on world fashion, and some new ideas have emerged in terms of color. The British Color Committee is now planning to use the colors of the exhibition items to make silk and cloth in January next year. The Queen has ordered a emerald green dress. By November 14, the exhibition had been visited by 1,468,298 people, averaging over 4,000 people per day. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi, will return to the country for orders in mid-January next year and will be succeeded by Arita, the current Ambassador to Belgium. Kuraishi Ichiro, Director-General of the Bureau of Commerce, will be appointed Ambassador to Belgium. Sawada, Consul-General in New York, or Murai, Consul-General in New Delhi, will be appointed Director-General of the Bureau of Commerce.

Whether Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Matsudaira, will return to his post is still in question. If he cannot return, Vice-Minister Shigemitsu will succeed him. Horiuchi, Director-General of the American Bureau, will be promoted to Vice-Minister. The honorable retirement of Ota, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, will also be realized next year.

<h3>Naval Conference Breaks Deadlock; Britain Puts Forward New Proposal; Exchange of Shipbuilding Plans for a Six-Year Term; Japan Insists on Common Upper Limit</h3>
<p>London: The First Committee of the Naval Conference continued its meeting this afternoon. The claim of a common upper limit proposed by Japan was decided to be temporarily shelved, and it was decided to study the quantitative restriction plan proposed by Britain tomorrow. After the meeting, a press release stated, "The committee, at the request of the Japanese delegation, conducted a detailed study of the method of implementing the common upper limit proposed by that country and decided to postpone it for reconsideration in the future, and tomorrow it will hold a meeting to discuss the British 'quantitative restriction plan'."

<p>London: Naval Minister Monsell announced today that Britain will present a plan for quantitative restrictions on naval issues on Tuesday. According to its content, the world's naval powers will exchange shipbuilding plans with each other within the next six years. Chief Japanese Delegate Admiral Nagano said that Japan must announce its demands after listening to the proposals of other countries. (National News dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>London: After the meeting of the chief delegates of the Naval Conference yesterday, there was a new change in the situation of the conference. The delegates of other countries raised many questions about Japan's proposal for equality, and in the end, no signs of a compromise on this demand could be found. Therefore, it was decided that, in order to facilitate the work of the conference, the Japanese delegates should continue bilateral discussions on this issue, while the General Assembly should change its stance and engage in discussions on the British proposal for quantitative restrictions on various types of warships. The British proposal asks countries to declare the number of ships they intend to reduce in the coming years. The number of years has not yet been determined. In order to avoid repeated convocations of the General Assembly, Britain advocates a six-year term, but France and Italy have declared their opposition to long-term treaty commitments. It is heard that the British proposal only aims to obtain concrete figures so that negotiations can proceed accordingly. The General Assembly will reconvene at 3:15 pm today. Bilateral talks on Japan's equality demand will begin this morning with a visit by the Japanese delegation to the American delegation. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>London: As is generally known, although the Japanese delegation has agreed to discuss the British naval proposal, it cannot be considered that the country has made any concessions to the claim of a common upper limit. The reason is that the country has only agreed to consider the British proposal within the scope of naval equality. A spokesman for the American delegation said that the content of the British proposal is not yet known, and that the key lies in maintaining the current naval balance and not making major changes before it can be accepted. Although the agenda of the Naval Conference Committee has been changed when it meets tomorrow, the delegations of various countries will largely maintain their original positions. As for Italy and France, they may not agree to the British proposal because it contains long-term constraints, which is something that these countries have always opposed.

<h3>US-Japan and UK-Japan Hold Separate Talks</h3>
<p>London: The Naval Conference resumed today. US Representative Davis opposed Japan's demand for naval equality and had a verbal battle with Japanese Representative Nagano. Nagano declared that once a common limit is established, a situation of non-threat and non-aggression can also be established. Davis retorted, "If so, no one can prevent countries with large armaments from invading weak countries without armaments." These words were clearly a mockery of Japan's invasion of China. It is also heard that US and Japanese representatives held private meetings in the hope of breaking the deadlock. Although the process was said to be good, there were no results. Afterwards, US representatives met with British representatives to continue discussing the issue of exchanging shipbuilding plans for six years. (Kokumin News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>London: It is generally believed that when the representatives of the United States and Japan met this morning at the Naval Conference, they discussed the outline of the "Quantitative Restriction Plan" proposed by Britain. However, because the contents of this plan were still unknown, the results of the talks did not yield any new factors. What is known is that both sides used the British proposal as a basis to discuss whether there was a possibility of their respective claims being closer. Afterwards, the American representatives visited the British Admiralty, where they were informed of the details of the British proposal by Admiralty personnel. This proposal will be submitted to the First Committee, namely the General Committee on Naval Issues, for discussion this afternoon. Also, this morning, the chief American representative, Davis, accompanied by other representatives of that country, paid a visit to the personnel of the Italian delegation. The chief Japanese representative, Admiral Nagano, also led the personnel of that delegation to pay a visit to the chief French representative, Ambassador Corbin. All of these were of a congratulatory nature. (Havas dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>London: Nagano and Nagai, the two plenipotentiaries, visited the British Admiralty at 11 am on the 16th. The British representatives held the second private meeting between Japan and the United Kingdom. The meeting lasted for one and a half hours. The meeting was always centered on the British theory of fragility and the establishment of a Japanese common maximum limit, and negotiations were conducted on the issue of investigating actual naval strength. The Japanese representatives made every effort to persuade Britain with the strategy of persuasion, but failed to reach concrete discussions on the issue of application, and therefore decided to continue negotiations at the next meeting. It is heard that British Representative Admiral Chatfield told the Japanese representatives on the occasion that Britain, as the host country of the conference, would try its best to avoid encountering a deadlock so that the conference could be successfully concluded. (Japan Associated Press dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<h3>Views of the Japanese Naval Authorities on the British Proposal</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Navy Department expressed this decision regarding the British proposal for a shipbuilding declaration plan. It is heard that Japan does not need to reject the discussion of this issue of Britain's submission of a shipbuilding declaration plan. However, its content seems to be very different from Japan's fundamental policy. That is, its first item states that each government should ensure the equality of naval power and should automatically declare shipbuilding plans within a certain year, communicating them to other governments. What the Japanese government requires is not equality in principle but substantive equality. Therefore, it is most appropriate to discuss the shipbuilding plan after resolving the issue of substantive equality first. Also, the British proposal stipulates that when each country declares shipbuilding, it should not be bound by proportionalism or other international restrictions and can establish plans according to the required quantity, but it should agree in advance with each country on the maximum preservation limit for each type of warship and should not build warships exceeding this limit. This provision makes people feel that it recognizes Japan's fundamental claim, but in reality, it is based on the existing forces and hides the ambush money to extend proportionalism. Therefore, it still runs counter to Japan's consistent policy. The length of its implementation period is not a problem. (Japan Associated Press dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Main Reasons for Changing the Agenda</h3>
<p>London: When the First Committee of the Naval Conference met this afternoon, the Japanese representatives suddenly agreed to postpone the discussion of the common upper limit claim they had put forward and agreed to begin discussing the "Quantitative Restriction Plan" proposed by Britain at tomorrow's meeting. This move was quite unexpected. Afterwards, the committee issued a press release, stating that the postponement of the discussion of the Japanese proposal was temporary in nature, but in fact, it may have been postponed indefinitely. According to the sudden change in the conference agenda, the main reason is that since the opening of the conference, Britain and the United States have always opposed Japan's claims, resulting in a stalemate. In today's meeting, the representatives of various countries all exhausted their wisdom in the hope of breaking the deadlock and finding a new path. They wanted to clarify whether Japan's claim of a common upper limit could be reconciled with the claims of Britain and the United States. The claims of Britain and the United States are that the geographical and military realities of various countries are different, and their naval forces can naturally maintain considerable differences accordingly. Regarding this level, the Japanese representatives will explain that they can agree to the differences in the naval power of various countries. After the common upper limit is formed in the future, it is okay for the number of ships built by each country to be excessive or insufficient, but the difference should not be too large. The US representatives immediately urged the Japanese representatives to put forward concrete suggestions on this issue. The Japanese representatives replied that discussing the details of implementation is the task of the Naval Conference, not something that Japan can specialize in. At this point, the representatives of various countries successively expressed their opinions, and finally, the British representatives proposed to temporarily retain the Japanese claim and wait for reconsideration in the future, and also proposed that the First Committee consider the "most restrictive" issue proposed by that country. The representatives of various countries, including the Japanese representatives, immediately expressed their agreement. A debate caused by Japan's claims for a week has come to an end temporarily.

<h3>Situation of the First Committee's Meeting the Day Before Yesterday; The Principle of Naval Equality Was Not Recognized; Japan Expressed Its Refusal to Discuss Concrete Plans</h3>
<p>London: The First Committee of the Naval Conference met at 3 pm on the 16th. Nagano and Nagai from Japan, as well as Specialist Committee Member Iwashita, Secretary Yamagata, and Translator Mizota attended. The plenipotentiaries of various countries also attended with a very small number of committee members. Naval Minister Monsell served as chairman and first spoke, saying that today's meeting will follow the resolution of the previous meeting, greatly reduce the size of the First Committee, limit the number of attendees, and hope that the plenipotentiaries of various countries will express their opinions as much as possible, from general discussions to individual problem negotiations, from theoretical discussions to concrete discussions, with the discussion of Japan's common maximum limit issue as the fuse. The plenipotentiaries of various countries waited to speak and asked the Japanese plenipotentiaries if there was room for concession. The Japanese plenipotentiaries stated that Japan's position could not retreat one step. Also, regarding the proposal to request a common maximum limit number, they still insisted on first recognizing the theoretical discussion, saying that once the principle is determined, it is not difficult to solve the number problem. The meeting adjourned at 5:50 pm. Today's meeting was just a repetition of the matters discussed last week, with no progress. The Japanese representatives consistently refused to discuss concrete issues before the principle was determined. The representatives of various countries felt disappointed because Japan did not take a compromise approach. The next meeting is scheduled to continue at 3 pm on the 17th.

<h3>Reorganization of the US Silver Bloc of Congressmen; Continuing the Fight for Silver Legislation</h3>
<p>Washington: An Associated Press reporter learned today that the Congressmen from the Rocky Mountain states will reorganize the silver bloc in the House of Representatives to facilitate the fight for silver legislation. The group will be reorganized and ready when Congress convenes in early January, and will be led by Congressman Murdock. It is now heard that most of the western Congressmen are dissatisfied with the Treasury Department's implementation of the silver purchase law. After detailed investigation, they will submit a remedial plan. The former silver Congressmen will also cooperate closely with the Senators who are inclined to their goals, especially the "Big Four," namely Senators Pittman, King, William Thomas, and Wheeler. It is difficult to predict the impact of this move, because the silver blocs in the Senate and House of Representatives will have differences of opinion. The silver Congressmen in the House of Representatives clearly believe that adding a silver rider to the bonus bill is inappropriate, but for other bills, they may cooperate with the inflationists in the House of Representatives. Informed observers believe that the length of the debate on the silver bill in the next Congress will probably depend on the length of the session. If President Roosevelt can shorten the session, silver may become a decisive issue. If the session is extended beyond April, the silver bill will definitely become the focus of heated debate. The silver issue is of great importance to the western states during next year's presidential election. Public opinion polls in the western states have shown that people's interest in the New Deal is decreasing. The government may use the silver issue as a government banner.

<h3>Hoover Criticizes the New Deal; Direct Challenge to Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Palo Alto, California: Former President Hoover responded today to President Roosevelt's Thanksgiving speech. This is Hoover's most direct challenge to the current government. Hoover completely denied Roosevelt's claim that the cultural opportunity had come to a standstill on March 3, 1933. Hoover believes that President Roosevelt's order to suspend payments at national banks was caused by the nervousness of depositors and bank authorities. Hoover firmly believes that the tide of economic panic had turned during the July 1932 election, and that the beginning of economic progress was also visible. Even without Roosevelt's New Deal, it would gradually improve. Hoover also criticized the relief system, saying that the relief system created by the government was what we had tried our best to oppose in the past. The current waste and corruption in relief work is really indescribable. (National News dispatch from the 16th)</p>

<h3>Two Ships Collide at Dagukou South Port</h3>
<p>Tianjin: The Beifu, a cargo ship of the Northern Shipping Company, carrying more than 1,000 tons of cargo, sailed from Tanggu to Hankou and arrived at Dagukou South Port. At that time, the Pingshun, a cargo ship of the Datong Company, sailed from Tanggu to Shanghai, intending to overtake it. Because of the strong wind, the rudder was not fixed, and the two ships collided. The Pingshun suffered slight damage to its front right side. The fourth cabin of the Beifu was flooded, the engine room leaked, and the motor failed. The company sent tugs and small steamers to the rescue. Because the water was shallow locally, it did not sink. It was towed to Tanggu and moored. The owners of the two ships each blamed the Maritime Administration. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<h3>Hitler's Book; Chinese and Blacks Discussed Together; Ambassador Liu Considers it an Insult and Submits a Representation</h3>
<p>Berlin: In his book "Mein Kampf," written by German leader Hitler, there is a chapter that lists and discusses "blacks and Chinese." It is heard that Liu Chongjie, the Chinese Ambassador stationed in Berlin, visited the German Propaganda Department at the end of the term and had an informal conversation with Fink, the agent of Dr. Goebbels, saying that a large part of the Chinese people opposed the arguments in that chapter and that it was unbearable to associate blacks and Chinese in the same way. Fink replied humbly that Hitler never wanted to harm the feelings of the great Chinese people. The Germans have always respected the Chinese people to the highest degree and will cancel or revise the chapter when it is republished. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<h3>Elder Statesmen and Important Ministers of Japan (Part 1): The Secret Struggle Between the Spiritual Movement Faction and the Liberal Faction</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>To understand the changes in the Japanese political situation, we must first understand the nature of the elder statesmen and important ministers of Japan, because their actions can influence the overall situation. In recent years, the power of the new military clique has been growing stronger, and it has the momentum to override the elder statesmen and important ministers, but no matter what important national affairs, they must still be approved by them before a decision can be made. Now, let's briefly state the relationship between the elder statesmen and important ministers of Japan and the country.</p>
<p>1.  Recent Elder Statesmen</p>
<p>Today, Japan has only one elder statesman, Prince Kinmochi Saionji, and seven important ministers: Interior Minister Count Nobuaki Makino, Privy Council President Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, Prime Minister-designate Count Keigo Kiyoura, Civil Administration Party President Baron Reijiro Wakatsuki, former Prime Minister Viscount Makoto Saito, and Finance Minister-designate Korekiyo Takahashi. These elder statesmen and important ministers stand at the highest position in the Japanese political world, and are actually the key figures in creating cabinets and the helmsmen who influence the overall situation. Whenever there is a change in the political situation, the world pays attention to their actions, because at such times, they can make suggestions to the Emperor and assist in making decisions, but they absolutely do not want to interfere with general administration. After the cabinet is formed, they let the cabinet act freely and never participate in opinions or interfere with policy guidelines. This is the creed followed by the only elder statesman, Saionji, and it is also the true spirit of Japanese constitutional politics.</p>
<p>The formalization of elder statesmen began in the first year of the Taisho era. The elder statesmen of the past held great power alone, like the Supreme Lord Lao. For example, Hirobumi Ito, Aritomo Yamagata, Kaoru Inoue, and Masayoshi Matsukata were called the elder statesmen of the Restoration and often stood above the cabinet, influencing the major policies of administration. Therefore, the successive cabinets of Japan were often constrained by the elder statesmen. When Prince Saionji came to power, he was involved in a major change of impeachment in the palace due to the infighting of the giants Yamagata, Inoue, and Matsukata. He felt that this kind of malpractice was very inappropriate. Since he was an elder statesman, he set an example and never interfered in political views. Up to now, he has never changed.</p>
<p>Saionji's qualification as an elder statesman was officially recognized in August of the first year of Taisho. At that time, the giants included Duke Aritomo Yamagata, Duke Iwao Oyama, Duke Taro Katsura, Marquis Kaoru Inoue, and Marquis Masayoshi Matsukata. When Taisho ascended the throne, he summoned the five people to the palace and personally issued an edict saying: "I have suddenly inherited the great rule, and I am cautious day and night, fearing that I will not be able to keep up. You have assisted the late Emperor for many years and personally received the holy will. Now that I inherit the legacy of the late Emperor, I still hope that you will loyally assist me." At that time, the Prime Minister was Saionji (still a marquis), and he alone received the edict: "I inherited the great rule at a time when there were many internal and external affairs. I am worried day and night, fearing that I will fail to live up to the legacy of the late Emperor. In the future, "the palace and the government should cooperate with each other" to assist me. You have been entrusted with the great responsibility of assisting the country, and you should understand this purpose and convey it to the ministers." The sentence "the palace and the government should cooperate with each other" in this edict is to instruct all parties to coordinate with each other, not to have selfish opinions, and not to engage in infighting. Therefore, Saionji followed these two important edicts, practiced them personally, and no longer sought the opinions of palace officials on everything, making Yamagata and other elder statesmen helpless.</p>
<p>In December of the first year of Taisho, when Saionji stepped down, he received a special edict for his dedication and loyalty, and was praised extensively. As a result, Saionji's prestige grew and he entered the ranks of elder statesmen. Originally, Saionji was very fair and had no prejudice. He also had broad vocational views and keen judgment. He always stood on a purely objective position when dealing with everything.</p>
<p>In these twenty years, all the elder statesmen have passed away one after another, and now he is the only one left. He is already eighty-six years old this year, but he is still loyal to his duties and never changes. Whenever there is a political change, the Emperor must send a special envoy to consult with him. He considers the internal and external situation with an impartial attitude and informs the Emperor, so the cabinets that have emerged in Japan in recent years have been able to gain the support of both the upper and lower levels.</p>
<p>Speaking of important ministers, their status and duties have not yet been formalized, but each has its own partial potential power. The "Conference of Important Ministers" began last year. Last July, when the Saito cabinet resigned en masse, the successor to the cabinet could be recommended by Saionji alone according to the old practice. Saionji, realizing that he was old, thought that when a political change occurred after his death, there should be a proper way to organize the successor cabinet. He summoned the Interior Minister, the President of the Privy Council, and those who had experience as Prime Minister to seek their opinions on the successor cabinet. This is the so-called Conference of Important Ministers. The Okada cabinet was produced in this way. At that time, those who attended were Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, Count Keigo Kiyoura, Baron Reijiro Wakatsuki, Viscount Makoto Saito, and Korekiyo Takahashi. They all had the qualifications of important ministers and were prominent leaders of various factions. The significance of this decision-making meeting is very important. In the future, the formation of cabinets in Japan will generally follow this method.</p>
<p>In May of the seventh year of Showa, when the May 15th Incident occurred, Saionji also convened the important ministers to discuss the aftermath. At that time, the important ministers also included Marshal Togo and Marshal Uehara of the Navy and Army. As a result of the meeting, Saito was recommended to form a cabinet. This meeting was informal, but Saionji felt it was quite appropriate. When the Okada cabinet was organized last year, it was formally decided that the "principle of the Conference of Important Ministers to produce a new cabinet" would be adopted. However, the important ministers still could not interfere with policy guidelines except for selecting cabinet members.</p>
<p>During the Saito cabinet, the Japanese government decided to withdraw from the League of Nations. Count Gonbei Yamamoto believed that the issue was important and that the Conference of Important Ministers should be convened frequently to determine the cabinet's stay. Saito agreed with him because Yamamoto was a senior. Later, he went to Okitsu to consult with Saionji. Saionji was very disapproving, believing that the policies set by the government should not be interfered with by the important ministers. As a result, the government's fixed policy was still implemented. Originally, Saionji valued the responsible cabinet system, advocating that the government should be fully responsible for all political affairs, and only the government should be questioned about the success or failure of policies. People outside the government should never participate in opinions and disrupt the government, so that the spirit of constitutional politics can be discovered. Saionji's view was generally respected by the important ministers. Therefore, the development of constitutional politics in Japan in recent years must be attributed to Saionji alone.</p>
<p>2.  Liberal Important Ministers</p>
<p>Since Yamamoto's death, the important ministers have all taken on a liberal hue, and the central figure is Count Nobuaki Makino. Makino is the Interior Minister, close to the Emperor, and responsible for assisting the government. In terms of rank, Count Keigo Kiyoura should have been in the first place. Because Kiyoura had formed two cabinets before and after, and had served as President of the Privy Council, his experience in the Meiji and Taisho eras could be compared with that of Saionji. However, Kiyoura had withdrawn from the political world, and was old, living quietly in Atami, and not asking about world affairs, so Makino led the important ministers. Makino's ideas were the same as Saionji's, and he had close relations with the court and the cabinet. He took liberalism as his fundamental idea, and was highly trusted by the important ministers. It can also be said that he is the leader of the liberal important ministers. The person who supported Makino the most was Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma. Hiranuma was well-versed in ancient and modern times, and served as Minister of Education, Minister of Internal Affairs, Privy Councilor, and Vice President of the Privy Council. Later, Makino transferred to be Interior Minister, and Hiranuma succeeded him as Minister of the Palace. Hiranuma was able to serve as a Privy Councilor because of Aritomo Yamagata's intention. Because the Privy Council was completely dominated by Hirobumi Ito's power during the Restoration era. People like Ito Miyoji and Kentaro Kaneko had considerable influence in the court. Yamagata recommended Hiranuma to the Privy Council because he was intelligent and had rich ideas, and to monitor the Ito faction.</p>
<p>As for Baron Reijiro Wakatsuki, Viscount Makoto Saito, and Korekiyo Takahashi, they were originally in the outer circle of the important ministers, but they have extremely strong power in today's political world. In other words, the three of them have special relationships with the environment of realistic politics. Wakatsuki has served as Prime Minister and President of the Civil Administration Party, Saito was the former Prime Minister, and recently called for the elimination of election campaigns, and hopes to succeed the Okada cabinet in the future. He has a particularly close relationship with the current Prime Minister Okada, and has deep origins with the "Important Ministers Alliance." He has many party members, and Takahashi has great power in the financial world, advocating stability and having the potential to influence the political situation. Therefore, although these three people are not in the circle of important ministers, their ideas are common. For example, Wakatsuki's theory of party politics, Saito's theory of constitutionalism, and Takahashi's theory of rejecting fascism all promote liberalism and democracy. Therefore, their ideas coincide with those of the important ministers. This is the reason why Japan must adhere to this doctrine when deciding on the candidates for the successor cabinet today.</p>

<h3>Record of the Execution of Bandit Leader Huang Fu Kai in Southern Zhejiang: Huang Bandit Was the Director of the Political Department of the Pseudo-Independent Division, Captured at Mantouling in Changhua, and Executed by Gun</h3>
<p>Lishui Communication: Huang Fuwu, the pseudo-Central Committee member and director of the Political Department of the Pseudo-Southwestern Zhejiang Independent Division, was captured by the 14th Division near Mantouling in Suichang on October 31. He was then escorted to the headquarters of the 18th Army in Lishui, and a telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to ask for instructions on how to deal with him. Later, a telegram was received from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing Provisional Headquarters, approving his execution on the spot. At 2:00 pm on December 12, the unit signed and took the bandit to parade through the streets and then escorted him to the sandbar outside the Dashuimen gate for execution. Huang Bandit was from Geyang, Jiangxi, 29 years old, from a middle peasant family, slightly literate. He still has his mother, brothers, and wife at home. The income from the land is enough to support himself. In 1930, Fang Zhimin, a bandit, started a rebellion in the Geyang Hengfeng area. Huang Bandit joined the Communist Youth League and served as the pseudo-district committee member, leading the pseudo-guerrilla team and the Young Pioneers. In 1932, he formally joined the Communist Party and served as the secretary of the pseudo-Shangrao Geyang county committee. In 1934, he was elected as a member of the pseudo-Central Committee at the pseudo-National Second Congress of Soviets. This spring, Liu Ying and Su Yu's bandit troops fled to southern Zhejiang and established the pseudo-Southwestern Zhejiang Independent Division. Guan Ying, the secretary of the pseudo-Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Provincial Committee, sent Huang Bandit to serve as the director of the pseudo-Division's Political Department. Wherever he went, he raised the slogan of "Down with the local tyrants and divide the land," looting and kidnapping in the most tragic way. The people of southern Zhejiang hated him to the bone. When the army encircled and suppressed them, the two bandits Liu and Su fled south to eastern Fujian. Huang Bandit was left to operate in the Suisong area, fleeing around. All his troops were captured. He then led a few guards, hiding during the day and traveling at night, planning to steal out of the blockade. Soon his guards were captured by the 14th Division. After interrogation, they learned of Huang Bandit's whereabouts. They then tracked him down with the local volunteer team and captured him near Mantouling. Huang Bandit was burly, with a face full of flesh, eagle eyes, and a jackal's voice, with a fierce aura. After being captured, he pleaded for mercy in a very miserable state. The authorities were initially quite lenient to him. When the order for execution came down, the prison guards added shackles to him. He then burst into tears and cursed loudly. Before the execution, he was still sleeping soundly with his head covered. When he was called up and escorted to the court, he saw the guards lined up in a solemn manner and knew that his death was near. His face suddenly turned pale. Then he said, "I am a tough guy, am I afraid of death? I knew there would be today." He was given wine and steamed buns, but he did not eat them. He also shouted reactionary slogans such as "Down with ×××." After being tied up, he was put in a yellow rickshaw to parade through the streets. He still shouted slogans loudly along the street, and his fierce aura did not diminish. When he entered the execution ground, he got out of the car and took a few steps, stopped, and looked back at the executioner and said, "Okay, you can hit me." The executioner fired a shot immediately, and he fell to the ground in response. The demon who had wreaked havoc for a while also met his final end here. At that time, the execution ground was surrounded by mountains of people. Seeing Huang Bandit fall to the ground, everyone clapped their hands and cheered. Several people who had been poisoned by him took knives and wanted to cut out his heart and liver, but they were stopped by the army before they left in disappointment. His many evil deeds in his life are hateful, which can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Bandit Atmosphere Revives in Henan Province: Banditry is Most Severe in Southern and Northern Henan, Most Bandits are Small and Scattered</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Communication: In recent years, all industries have declined, and the rural areas have gone bankrupt. In addition to frequent floods and droughts, many unemployed people have taken risks and become bandits. Since this winter, the bandit atmosphere in Henan Province has revived. Fortunately, most of them are small and scattered bandits. However, in northern Henan, secret society bandits sometimes collude with foreigners. In the southern Henan area bordering Anhui and Hubei, there are often remnants of Red bandits harassing the area. The situation is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Secret Society Bandits in Northern Henan: Northern Henan has always been an area without bandits, but in recent years, robberies and kidnappings have been heard from time to time. Now in Anyang, Qixian, Huojia, Huixian, Jixian, Xiuwu, Mengxian, Xinxiang, Junxian, Boai, Linxian, Wenxian, Mengjin, Wuan, Shexian, Jiyuan, Fengqiu, and other counties, bandits appear from time to time. The largest number of bandits is only 2-400, and the rest are either 10, 20, or 5-60. The weapons are mostly rifles and pistols. Northern Henan, Anyang, Wuan, Linxian, and Shexian are located in the area where Hebei and Henan meet, and there are many mountains. The people are extremely valiant. In addition, recently, foreigners have been inciting them from time to time. At the end of last month, reactionary leaflets were found in Cejing Town on the border between Wuan County and Shexian County. Bandits are also lurking inside and outside Wuan County, planning to use Wuan as a base, gather bandits, and organize the National Protection and Rebellion Army. Later, they were uncovered by the county government. In addition, remnants of the Tianmen Society in Linxian have recently gathered society bandits under the slogan of "helping the poor and enriching the rich" in order to revive. Zhou Bo, the leader of the Tianmen Society bandits in Anyang, has recently gathered people in the Dongxi Security Guyeqiao area of the county to extort huge sums of money from the villagers and confiscate self-defense guns.</p>
<p>Red Bandits in Southern Henan: The banditry in southern Henan is the most worrisome due to the remnants of the Red bandits fleeing and running rampant. Now, the remnants of the Red bandits mostly appear in the territory of Xinyang, Luoshan, Huangchuan, Shangcheng, Guangshan, Jingfu, Gushi, and other counties. Because the above counties are mostly located at the junction of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, and there are many mountains, they are easy to hide. In addition, there are frequent bandit alarms in Linying, Yexian, Xihua Wuyang, Xiping, Zhumadian, Yancheng, Suiping, Runan, Zhengyang, Tongbai, and Yuxian, but most of them are kidnappings and robberies, and there are no large gangs.</p>
<p>Eastern, Western, and Central Henan: The counties in eastern, western, and central Henan are still relatively peaceful, but robberies and plunderings are heard from time to time. Recently, robberies and kidnappings have often occurred in Lanfeng, Zhengzhou, Chengnan, Shagu, Licun, Yanling, Yongcheng, Qixian, Guanzhuang, Shiyuan, Tai Kangxiaoyan Village, Liuyuan Kou in Kaifeng, and near Zhongmu Station. Kidnappings and robberies have occurred in Songxian County and Luoyang City in western Henan, which shows the rampant nature of the bandits. In addition, the tomb robbery trend in Luoyang is also rampant.</p>
<p>Suppressing the Bandits: In addition to sending troops to suppress the bandits, the provincial government and the Pacification Commissioner's Office have replied to the county magistrates, asking them to list the methods for suppressing bandits based on their own opinions, in order to gather wisdom and benefit each other. In addition, they have been quite active in training the strong men in the counties, in order to ensure that the people have the ability to defend themselves. The Baojia system in the counties is well managed. Therefore, once the situation turns around and the disasters are reduced, the bandit atmosphere will not be difficult to eliminate immediately.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Extension of Election of County Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce convened executive and supervisory committee members and representatives of various trade associations yesterday to hold a joint meeting. The Pawn Trade Association proposed to postpone the election of the County Chamber of Commerce for three months and explained the reasons. The public decision was passed, and notices were sent to the various trade associations.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Aftermath of the Theater Conflict</h3>
<p>Following the conflict between fire brigade members and the Suzhou Grand Theater, mediation by officials and gentry has resulted in a settlement between both parties. However, Zhang Fulin, the theater doorman, sustained severe injuries and has filed a request with the local court for a medical examination and the detention of the defendant, Dong Ziqin, and others involved. The District Procuratorate has scheduled a hearing for the 18th, issuing summons to the defendant, fire brigade member Dong Ziqin, and more than ten witnesses, including Liang Biwu, a patrol officer from the Second and Third Precincts of the Public Security Bureau, and Sun Zhenqiu, the manager of the Suzhou Grand Theater, for investigation and trial.</p>
<h3>Police and Soldiers Open Fire on Each Other Due to Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>Wang Xianhui, a patrol officer from the Public Security Bureau of Wujiang County, and police detectives, aboard a boat, sailed to Guajing Harbor on the 16th to search for bandits. Near Yuexi Town, they spotted over ten suspicious *wuwu* boats. As it was dark, they fired a shot into the air as a warning. Unexpectedly, a watch post was located nearby in Shuxiang Township, Wuxian County. Upon hearing the gunshot, the watchmen mistook them for bandits and returned fire. The Wujiang officers also mistakenly believed they were resisting arrest, and continued firing. Both sides exchanged fire for half an hour before realizing the misunderstanding and ceasing. Together, they captured five suspected bandits, including Lu Xiaoma, Chen Changcai, and Xu Xiaowuzi, on the *wuwu* boats, and escorted them along with the boats to the Central Jiang Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: All Silk Factories in the County Will Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn this year, overseas sales of raw silk have become increasingly active, and silk prices have gradually risen. In October, the country's foreign trade exports reached more than six million yuan, regaining its leading position. However, by the end of November, due to the accumulation of inventory, silk sales stagnated, and silk prices in European and American markets fell again. Silk factories in the county with meager capital were forced to suspend operations in September and October due to a shortage of raw materials. Recently, all silk factories have felt a shortage of raw materials and are unable to maintain operations. Of the twelve silk factories that started operations in early autumn, five suspended operations in September, four in October, and three in November. The remaining factories are also struggling to maintain the status quo, with the shortage of raw materials being a major reason. Currently, apart from Yongtai, Huaxin, and the Qian factories, all factories will suspend operations before the end of the year. The situation is critical, and the impact on our silk industry is significant.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Tan Shu Station on the Wu-Li Road Robbed</h3>
<p>Chang Yanguoquan, manager of the Li-Wu Line Management Office of the Jiangsu Construction Department's Highway Administration, sent a letter to the county government on the 16th, stating: "At around 8:00 PM on the 4th, eight or nine robbers suddenly arrived at Tan Shu Station on the Li-Wu Road. Wielding wooden sticks and iron rulers, they falsely claimed to be conducting a household survey and pried open the back door, stealing a ticket box containing passenger tickets, copper seals, lead type, and more than five yuan and six jiao in silver dollars, as well as quilts, clothes, and other items. The homeowner, Wang Linda, was beaten and injured. The incident was immediately reported to Shen Shikui, the stationmaster of Wujin Station, who confirmed the report. All passenger ticket numbers are interrupted, so all passenger train tickets to and from the station should be temporarily suspended to prevent bandits from selling them and causing disputes. A request for a swift investigation is also made."</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Deposit Dispute at the Dahua Bank</h3>
<p>Since announcing the suspension of business on October 11, the Hangzhou branch of the Dahua Bank has issued notifications to reimburse depositors. The first phase, totaling over ten thousand yuan, for current savings accounts, was paid out on the 16th of last month. The second phase, totaling over twenty thousand yuan for fixed savings accounts under one thousand yuan, was originally scheduled for payment on the 11th of this month, but was temporarily postponed to the 16th. However, yesterday, the bank suddenly announced that the liquidation office would move to Shanghai, with an initial payment of 20% to be made in Shanghai. Creditors were deeply dissatisfied, and over 150 people gathered at the liquidation office to demand payment, resulting in a dispute. Subsequently, a representative from the Dahua Bank's head office in Shanghai arrived in Hangzhou and, after negotiations this morning, decided to make an initial payment of 20% in Hangzhou on the 20th of this month, with the remaining 80% to be recovered by the Hangzhou liquidation office and paid out on January 16, 1936. A written agreement was signed to resolve the matter.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Arrest of Suspects Illegally Collecting Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Recently in Jiaxing City, some merchants were profiting by illegally collecting silver dollars. After the county party headquarters discovered this, they cooperated with the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau to arrest Hong Weijin, an employee of the Qin Yi Sundries Store on North Main Street; Chen Xinqiao of the Guangming Sock Factory; He Shiquan, an employee of the Dazhongmeng Department Store; Wang Deye, the owner of the Lao Yida Department Store; as well as Chen Tongwen and Wang Chunyou. On the afternoon of the 16th, after separate interrogations by the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Tongwen, Wang Deye, and Hong Fusheng were deemed to have committed minor offenses and were released on bail. Hong Weijin, Chen Xinqiao, and He Baoquan were found to have been illegally collecting silver dollars and were ordered to be detained pending review.</p>
<h3>Letter: Letter from Overseas Chinese in Siberia</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor: There have always been many overseas Chinese in Siberia, USSR. Since the Eastern Provinces Incident, many anti-Japanese civilians and soldiers from the volunteer armies, due to depleted ammunition and lack of reinforcements, were forced to retreat to the Soviet Union, numbering no less than tens of thousands. Fortunately, the neighboring country showed compassion and accepted them. The refugees were sent to areas around New Siberia, where they were assigned work, some felling trees in the forests, others mining coal in the mines. However, the area is extremely cold, requiring cotton clothing even in summer. In spring, the snow is still several feet deep. The snowy landscape is bitingly cold. Our people, who grew up in temperate zones, are unaccustomed to such conditions and suffer from frostbite and starvation. Eight or nine out of ten suffer from waist and leg pain. In summer, they suffer from malaria and epidemics due to acclimatization, which recur repeatedly. Coupled with homesickness and sorrow, they are constantly depressed, living in poverty and illness, akin to beggars. Although the Soviet authorities provide care, there are many barriers due to language differences. Furthermore, New Siberia has no consulate to which to appeal.</p>
<p>Since taking office, I have spared no effort to find livelihood opportunities for them. I have not shied away from hardship and have been dedicated to public service. Seeing the difficulties of the overseas Chinese, I have been deeply saddened. Whenever I encounter disabled, impoverished, or sick individuals, I do my best to help them, even using my own salary to buy food and clothing for relief. Both the Chinese and Soviet sides acknowledge my fairness. Since Mr. Li's arrival, the treatment of overseas Chinese by the Russian side has improved, and the overseas Chinese people have been deeply reassured. Recently, I heard that Consul-General Li is ill from overwork and may resign. Upon hearing this, the overseas Chinese community was shocked, fearing that they would return to the old ways after his departure. In addition to appealing to the government to retain Consul-General Li, we are sending a letter to your newspaper to publish the plight of the people, to express the gratitude of the people and to thank Consul-General Li for his dedication to the country and the people.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Overseas Chinese Community in Siberia, Russia: Hu Kun, Wang Zhenshan, Zhao Youcai, Han Youcai, Zhu Xicheng, Liu Runzhai, Zhang Yadong, Meng Qingtai, Wu Guangyi, Wei Chunli, Zhao Chunhai, Zhang Xuezong, Zhang Shengsan, Zhang Fengshan, An Bingwen, Lu Qinglian, Zhang Shude, and 21,400 others.

<h3>Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>—Gu Shusen, Director of the Department of General Education, Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Finally, I have some suggestions regarding the implementation of compulsory education, and I hope everyone will study them and work together to help promote it, so that compulsory education in our country can be popularized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to discuss with everyone is how to raise funds for compulsory education. Our country has been promoting compulsory education for more than twenty years. Looking back at the past, the government's plans have always been just plans, and the actual results have always been minimal. The biggest reason is that there is no proper way to raise funds. If the funding problem is not solved first, how can we expect various places to start many schools? In our country, which is poor and lacks resources, it is certainly impossible to rely on local areas to raise large amounts of compulsory education funds on their own. However, if the government raises large amounts of funds to subsidize, it is still essentially taking from the people. Therefore, the most important issue is that whether the funds are raised locally by the provinces or subsidized by the central government, the source of compulsory education funds must first be determined to be the normal way to solve the problem. This requires reorganizing our forces and actively promoting compulsory education in a unified manner from top to bottom. For this year's funding, the central government has provided subsidies, and various provinces and cities have tried their best to raise funds. Not only has this not caused any problems, but it is also quite considerable. However, there are no suitable methods for how to increase and raise funds for the next year. If the source is not clearly stipulated, how will we continue in the future? This is very dangerous. Currently, the Ministry of Education, together with the Ministry of Finance, has drafted a general outline of temporary measures for raising compulsory education funds for various provinces and cities, and has already submitted it to the Executive Yuan for record. According to the second article, the compulsory education funds in each primary school district in each province, county, and city should be based on the number of schools established and the amount of funds needed. Each county and city should raise more than half of the funds locally. The fifth article stipulates five areas for raising compulsory education funds in each province, county, and city: (1) Income from school properties designated by the county and city governments and approved by the provincial government; (2) Income from legal donations and surcharges designated by the county and city governments and approved by the provincial government; (3) Income from reorganizing existing school properties and increasing income within the county and city government townships or school districts; (4) Voluntary donations from enthusiastic public welfare people for compulsory education funds; (5) Funds shared by the people through voluntary public deliberation and approved by law in counties, cities, or townships. These five areas are the five sources of funds for compulsory education, but it seems that the spring water is still buried under the mountains and rocks. We must use everyone's strength and work together to explore and develop them, so that they can continuously supply the promotion of compulsory education. In addition, we also hope that the central government and provincial governments will stabilize the sources of central and provincial subsidies so that they will not dry up temporarily.</p>
<p>The second problem is surveying school-age children and dividing primary school districts. These two are the basic tasks for implementing compulsory education. However, surveying school-age children is a very troublesome task, so in the past, various places mostly dealt with it perfunctorily and did not thoroughly handle it. In fact, it is not the most troublesome task as long as the primary school district is divided and a school board is set up in each district to handle it separately. After the schools in each district are established, teachers and students can also help with the survey at any time. Dividing primary school districts is the smallest unit for implementing compulsory education. The area must not be too large. This is different from the school districts that were divided in the past. Many people think that the existing administrative districts or autonomous regions can be used as school districts. This is a big mistake, because the primary school district that we want to divide now is the area where a short-term primary school is set up. We must not only consider the convenience of children in the district to go to school, but also calculate that a school board can handle tasks such as surveying school children, raising funds, and forcing children to enroll. They can also contact each other at any time, so that it will not be too difficult. Therefore, the implementing rules stipulate that the districts should be divided according to population, not completely according to region. This is the reason.</p>
<p>The third problem is to organize compulsory education committees at all levels and select school boards. Although there are many reasons why compulsory education has not been successful in the past, the lack of a complete organization of promotion agencies at all levels is also a very important reason. Therefore, this requires organizing compulsory education committees from the central government to the county level to assist the education authorities in carrying out implementation work. Its power is not only an advisory body. It is also given major responsibilities for economic allocation, use, custody, as well as plan review, guidance, and investigation, in order to facilitate progress. The school board is the promoting staff of the basic organization for implementing compulsory education. Whether the compulsory education in a primary school district can proceed smoothly and be completed on schedule depends entirely on whether the school board elected in each primary school district is effective. Therefore, the selection of school boards must be based on people who are wealthy and respected, handle affairs faithfully, understand things, and have a certain level of education.</p>
<p>The fourth problem is teacher training. Since short-term primary schools must be established according to primary school districts, the number of teachers needed at one time will inevitably be large. If there are not enough teachers locally, we can recruit people with a certain level of education, and the counties and cities can run short-term training classes to teach them teaching methods, guidance methods, school administrative organization laws, and various necessary teaching knowledge and skills. The curriculum does not need to be complicated. If there is too much homework, it will be counterproductive. This is the most important reason.</p>
<p>The fifth problem is to promote the establishment of short-term primary schools and enrich the grades and enrollment of existing primary schools. The purpose of promoting the establishment of short-term primary schools is to enable out-of-school children to receive appropriate education in a short period of time. Therefore, if there are ancestral temples or public places that can be used locally, they should be used as much as possible. All equipment does not need to be perfect in order to save funds. At the same time, we should also try our best to expand the grades and supplement the enrollment of existing primary schools. Other agencies or schools should also establish short-term primary school classes within the possible scope. The organization of short-term primary schools and short-term primary school classes should be based on the principle of running a two-part system. A half-day system or a full-day teaching system may be adopted depending on the environment.</p>
<p>The sixth problem is to improve private schools and conduct itinerant teaching. The purpose of why we want to run short-term primary schools has just been said. If there are private schools locally, we should also find ways to guide and improve them, and we should select an appropriate time to conduct training for private school teachers. The training time does not need to be too long each time. We may call them together for training again after a considerable period of time. The training work may be entrusted to local normal schools and middle schools to save funds. Itinerant teaching is used to teach out-of-school children in remote villages and those who have no schools to attend. It is a method to supplement the lack of schools. Therefore, itinerant teachers must be selected from personnel who are hardworking, dedicated, and enthusiastic about teaching. The itinerant area and time may be handled separately according to local conditions. In short, the more methods for promoting compulsory education, the better. Various places should adopt them according to local conditions. Even the small teacher system can be promoted if it is proven to be effective.</p>
<p>The seventh problem is that the county magistrate should be fully responsible for the implementation of compulsory education in various places. The implementation of compulsory education in various places, such as dividing school districts, surveying school-age children, borrowing school buildings, and forcing children to enroll, requires the assistance of local administrative assistants, local autonomy personnel, and public security bureau chiefs and police at any time and place. Since raising compulsory education funds is of utmost importance, the county magistrate must be fully responsible for it so that the operation can proceed smoothly everywhere. Therefore, we hope that the authorities of various provinces will pay serious attention to the experience of county magistrates in handling compulsory education.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to hope that the people of all localities should deeply understand that promoting compulsory education is a fundamental task for our country to save the country, strengthen the country, and revive the nation. Everyone should bear the responsibility of assisting in its implementation. Therefore, in the last sentence, I would like to ask compatriots all over the country to work together to complete the implementation of compulsory education. (End)</p>

<p>Declaration: Since the 918 and 128 incidents, our industry and commerce have been declining day by day. The ravages of war have already damaged their vitality, and economic aggression has cut off their vitality. Not enough to erode overseas markets, then increase the occupation of domestic markets. Not enough to import commodities, then increase the establishment of factories to manufacture them locally. The net is spread in all directions, and the demands are endless. Our industry and commerce have a weak foundation, and the country lacks the protection of national power. There is strong enemy encirclement from outside. The blame for defeat and destruction cannot be said to be on ourselves. In the history of industrial development in backward countries, none have relied on the support of national power. After the pain, we deeply know that without consolidating national power, it is not enough to talk about the revival of industry and commerce. After more than four years of experience of national crisis, (omitted) There is no chance of luck in forbearance. Right and wrong have been fully seen in the facts. Is there any other way to save the country? (omitted) During the 128 Songhu War, our industrial and commercial circles actively transported and saved the country, daring not to lag behind. Now, in the moment of life and death, we only hope that the government will quickly make the final and greatest resolution to safeguard the integrity of national territory and sovereignty. As long as we have a breath, we will definitely make greater efforts to be the government's rear support.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Telegram</p>

<h3>The Petition of the Salt Farmer Representatives from Yuyao Has a Satisfactory Outcome, the Inspectorate General of Salt Revenue Has Instructed the Liangzhe Salt Transport Office to Supervise and Urge the Salt Merchants to Collect Salt in Full Amount Immediately</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 16th), at around 10 am, salt farmer representatives, led by Shang Cailian, continued to petition at the Salt Revenue Inspectorate. They were again received by Inspector Shen. After the representatives explained their intentions, Mr. Shen replied that the instructions had been issued, ordering the Salt Transport Office to supervise and urge the salt merchants to collect salt in full amount immediately. The representatives then requested a copy of the instructions to inform the salt farmers in Yaochang and reassure them. Mr. Shen agreed. The instructions are copied below. However, it is understood that the salt farmer representatives, led by Shang Cailian, stated that they would only return to Yao after the salt merchants truly collect salt in full amount according to the regulations.

<h3>Secretary-General Yu Talks About the Municipal Government's Austerity Measures, Denying Any Mergers or Department Changes</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, recently there have been rumors that the Municipal Government, due to financial difficulties, is seeking to economize by reorganizing its departments, either by changing them into divisions or by merging those with similar functions. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired about this with Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, yesterday. Mr. Yu replied responsibly that the Municipal Government has indeed been implementing austerity measures due to economic difficulties. However, the rumors that certain bureaus will be merged with others, or that certain bureaus will be changed into divisions, are absolutely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Three Major Banks Sponsor the Promotion of Acceptance Bills and Agree to Centralized Issuance</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee accepted the suggestion of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and allocated 3 million yuan in national currency from the small-loan credit fund to handle the fund for the acceptance guarantee and rediscount of industrial and commercial bills, the Bankers Association and the Money Trade Association passed the principle and decided to issue it centrally, which will be sponsored by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Methods Passed</h3>
<p>In order to study the industrial and commercial bill acceptance fund, the Bankers Association not only passed the principle, but also specially organized a subcommittee, appointing Chen Zheqing, Luo Qinghua, Wu Yunzhai, Qu Jigang, and Hu Xian as members. After research, four methods were proposed, advocating centralized issuance by the bank with the largest amount of recognized funds. The second guarantee treasury certificate allocated by the Ministry of Finance will be kept by the sponsor. It has been passed by the Executive Committee of the Association and sent to the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee for verification. At the same time, the Money Trade Association also passed the principle of allocating funds to handle the industrial and commercial bill acceptance fund, advocating to handle Category A first and Category B later.</p>
<h3>Three Banks Sponsor</h3>
<p>The three banks with the largest credit loan applications for industrial and commercial small loans are the Central Bank (1 million yuan), the Bank of China (1 million yuan), and the Bank of Communications (500,000 yuan). The Bankers Association has now obtained the consent of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. As for the Central Bank, the decision will be made by the Loan Review Committee after negotiation. After the negotiation is completed, the Loan Review Committee will submit the previously passed method to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and then announce it for implementation. It is best to start before the year-end closing of various industries, because all industries hope that this method will be implemented as soon as possible, so that the troubled industries can recover. Two Methods The New Voice News Agency reporter yesterday re-recorded the following two methods for promoting the acceptance bill fund, Category A and Category B: (A) If industrial and commercial enterprises store raw materials and goods in warehouses, which are identified as needed and valuable in the market, and have undergone transfer procedures, they may fill out bank acceptance bills according to the discount stipulated in this method, which will be accepted by the trustee organization. (B) The amount of the bill requested by industrial and commercial enterprises shall not exceed 60% of the estimated value of the goods provided for guarantee. The acceptance period shall not exceed four months.</p>
<h3>Overwhelmed with Applications</h3>
<p>After the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee handled small credit loans, by yesterday's deadline, a total of 400,000 yuan in national currency had been loaned out. Now, because the year-end closing period for various industries is approaching, those who apply for loans these days are very crowded, with more than ten applications every day, ranging from 500 yuan to 5,000 yuan, mostly small-scale factories manufacturing domestic goods and commercial firms operating domestic goods. After the regular meeting of the association next Monday, the loans can be approved. The association has been particularly busy these days because of this.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Pawn Industry New and Old Merchants Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday to Shorten the Loan Period and Implement It on New Year's Day. Interest Rates Will Remain the Same</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pawn Industry Association, because the loan period has been shortened to twelve months, has been approved by the Municipal Government, and a joint meeting of new and old merchants was specially held at the guildhall in Wujia Lane, Nanshi, at 2 pm yesterday. It was resolved that it will be officially implemented from January 1, 1936. The interest rate will still be 1.8% per month. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: The Pawn Industry Association was originally divided into new and old merchants. The new merchants are those who opened stores in the Concession, and the old merchants are those who opened stores in the Chinese area. Yesterday, the attending representatives of the new and old merchants included Wu Qiutao of Tongyi Heng, Fu Zuoheng of Jihong Jitai, Fang Zhiyan of Changtai, Huang Wenru of Baotai, Xing Mengqun of Tongchang, Cheng Xiongfu of Hongji Anji, Ding Lvyong of Jiuda, Huang Daren of Yichang, Du Yunchu of Dinghe, Shen Bosheng of Dehe Taifeng, Lu Qiuqing of Yifeng, Yu Xueyan of Anchang, Qu Qiufang of Qianchang, Wang Aitang of Tongsheng, Xu Meizhi of Yuchang Yutai (representing Jia Zunyi), Cheng Rufu of Yutai, Weng Zhitian of Baokang, Jiang Xinan of Yuanchang, Wu Jimin of Wanjji, Ge Yunsheng of Zhenchang, Xia Xunru of Zhenda, and others, totaling twenty-seven people. Wu Qiutao and Fu Zuoheng were publicly elected as the presidium, and Yu Langxi and Lian Jieren were the recorders. Setting the Implementation Date: After the ceremony, Chairman Wu Qiutao reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, the proposal was discussed. The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued instructions that the application to shorten the expiration date of pawned goods to twelve months has been approved by the Municipal Government. The comrades should comply with the instructions and report the shortening date and the list of pawnbrokers who shorten and do not shorten. After deliberation, it was decided that the industry should uniformly shorten the expiration date to twelve months from January 1, 1936. All pawn tickets that originally had the stamp of eighteen months as the expiration date should be changed to twelve months, and the public should be notified by the association through the Shen, Xin, and Min three newspapers before implementation. The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued a copy of the rules for managing pawnshops' acceptance of various vehicles as collateral, and instructed the comrades to comply with it. After deliberation, it was decided to print it and inform the comrades to comply with it. The Municipal Government sent a letter soliciting exhibits for the Shanghai Museum. After deliberation, it was decided to inform the members to provide as much as possible, which will be forwarded by the association. Many routine cases were also passed. After the meeting, refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 pm.</p>
<p>The Interest Rate Remains the Same: According to the reporter of the Industrial and Commercial News Agency, this decision of the association to apply to the Municipal Government for shortening the loan period to twelve months is purely to adopt the requirements of the members of the new and old merchants, which is a last resort. The shortening is also temporary. If the market situation recovers slightly, the old system of eighteen months will be restored to adjust the social economy. According to the spokesperson of the association, the association has 45 old merchants and 27 new merchants, all of whom intend to shorten the loan period, but after implementation, the interest rate will still be charged according to the old rules, 1.8% per month, plus a warehouse rent of 0.2%. Twelve months is the full term, with a five-day grace period. Both incoming and outgoing transactions are in silver dollars. All other matters shall be handled in accordance with the business rules of the pawn industry in this city.</p>

<h3>Speculation on the Accident of Eurasia Airways No. 5. Mainly Due to Ice, Passengers Were Only Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>When Eurasia Airways No. 5 crashed near Lingtai in Gansu Province on November 27 this year, the company sent engineer He En to the accident site to provide relief and investigate the cause of the accident. The engineer arrived in Shanghai on the 14th by plane from Chengdu via Xi'an and Nanjing and reported in detail to Li Jingzong, the general manager of the company. The reporter specially visited yesterday and was informed that Flight No. 5 departed from Lanzhou for Xi'an on November 27 according to the scheduled time. According to the telegram communication between the plane and the radio stations in Lanzhou, Pingliang, and Xi'an, it is fully proven that everything was very safe before 9:25 am. Because at 9:25 am, the plane requested the Xi'an radio station to send a telegram giving direction instructions. After the Xi'an radio station sent it out, it received a reply from the plane confirming that it had received it without error. Since then, the three radio stations in Xi'an, Pingliang, and Lanzhou have not received any information from the plane. In addition to immediately sending telegrams to the governments of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, asking them to send telegrams to the counties near the Liupan Mountains to investigate the news, we also sent a plane each from Lanzhou and Xi'an stations on the next day (the 28th) to search. We were convinced that after Flight No. 5 sent a telegram requesting direction instructions at 9:25 am on the 27th, it must have encountered some kind of sudden reason and was forced to descend. It was confirmed that either the radio station inside the plane was damaged, or the lives of the flight personnel were unknown, so they could not continue to communicate with us. The planes sent on the 28th returned without any results due to extremely bad weather. On November 29, a telegram was received from the Gansu Provincial Government, and it was learned that Flight No. 5 was forced to descend in Sunjia Yawowan, 40 kilometers southwest of Lingtai County in Gansu Province. The pilot, Bloom, and the telegraph operator, Meier, were both killed. The passengers, Mr. Guo Junhanqing and Mr. Ma Yu, were also injured. The company immediately sent another plane and engineer He En to the accident site on the same day to provide relief and conduct investigations. On the other hand, the Xi'an Aviation Station, which was closer to the accident site, sent cars, hired Western doctors and service personnel, and rushed to the accident site to jointly provide relief. However, because the mountains were overlapping and the roads were rugged, it did not reach the destination until the fifth day after departure. The passenger surnamed Ma had already bought a car to Lanzhou, and the passenger surnamed Guo was only injured in the head, but was too frightened, and had not been able to speak when we left Lingtai, so there was no way to inquire about the actual situation. Therefore, we had to make a thorough on-site inspection based on the condition of the damaged aircraft and its posture. The results confirmed that the fuselage and engine of the aircraft did not change when it was forced to land. From this, it can be concluded that the cause of the accident was definitely not due to the aircraft itself. Then it must be due to the impact of the severe weather. When Bloom drove the plane from Lanzhou, the weather was very clear, but when flying over the Liupan Mountains, the weather must have been very bad, either with heavy rain or heavy snow. The aircraft was affected by the weather changes and had to fly in the clouds. After a long period of cold air invasion on the fuselage, when it entered the clouds and was flying blindly, its wings and tail rudder were frozen, and the danger occurred because of this. After the aircraft is frozen, the load will change, and at the same time, the aerodynamic structure will also change, and the aircraft will not be able to maintain a certain altitude (the ground here is already 2,000 meters above sea level, and is extremely rugged). At this time, the pilot Bloom had no choice but to make a temporary descent. At the same time, according to the residents of the accident site, when the plane crashed, the local clouds and fog were extremely thick. In order to avoid being hit by a high-speed accident, the pilot Bloom had already adopted a very low speed in the air to descend slowly. Unfortunately, the line of sight was blocked by the fog, and he did not realize that he was still high off the ground. Therefore, although the plane was still able to maintain a horizontal posture at the time, it eventually fell down. Due to the strong vibration, the engine broke away from the fuselage and fell into the soil in front of the fuselage. The tail rudder was broken at the same time, and the middle of the wing was also crushed. The reason why the pilot Bloom and the telegraph operator Meier were killed was mainly due to the severe vibration injuries to their bodies. The two passengers were not in any danger other than being frightened because the aircraft cabin was unusually strong. Although the above is speculation, it is based on the condition of the damaged aircraft and its posture after falling to the ground, and a thorough inspection was conducted. It should not be very different.</p>
<p>Pilot Bloom had served in Eurasia Airways as a telegraph operator and pilot, flying a total of 413,421 kilometers. He was known for his calm and prudence. The telegraph operator Meier had flown a total of 331,9739 kilometers. His work was also highly praised by the company's personnel. It is really sad to have encountered this misfortune. The coffins of the two men have been transported to Shanghai from Xi'an by train. After consulting their families, they may be transported back to Germany.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Ships Decide to Suggest a Cash Purchase Ticket Method to Avoid Confiscation by Customs</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the legal tender, according to the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, ships were no longer allowed to use cash. Therefore, customs officers strictly searched, and all passengers carrying cash were confiscated. The Jiangshun ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Wuhu, because the passengers from the countryside mostly bought tickets with cash, had no choice but to accept it. More than one hundred yuan in cash was collected for passenger tickets and was confiscated by the Wuhu customs officers. The ship's purser and business director went to the Wuhu customs to meet with Director Zhao, requesting the return of the money and the exchange of legal tender, but the customs refused. It is still under negotiation. However, the various Yangtze River ships believe that this matter is of great importance. In the future, passengers boarding ships along the Yangtze River should be allowed to accept the cash they paid for the tickets on the ship. They should not be confiscated until the last port. They must wait until the ship arrives at the port and send it to the National Bank to exchange for legal tender to avoid losses to merchants and civilians. We would like to ask the customs to issue a locked iron box with a long slit on the top and place it in the ship's purser's room. If anyone buys a ticket with cash, the crew will store the cash in the box and send it to the customs for opening and exchange for legal tender when it arrives at the last port. In this way, it will not only comply with national policies and regulations, but also avoid accidental losses to the ships. This method has been decided by the ship's comprador and business director and submitted to the customs for consideration.</p>
<h3>The Huashun Ship Runs Aground Outside Huangpu Port in Guangzhou and is Waiting for the Tide to Rise</h3>
<p>The Huashun ship of the Huasheng Shipping Company, managed by the Yitaixing Coal Company in this port, has a deadweight of 3,033 tons, a length of 328 feet 9 inches, a width of 39 feet 6 inches, and a draft of 22 feet. It was decided to load a full ship of coal from Pukou and transport it to Guangzhou for delivery. Yesterday morning, the Huashun ship arrived outside Huangpu Port in Guangzhou, at a place called Second Sandbar. Because the tide was ebbing, the ship suddenly ran aground. The Huashun ship has a deep draft and heavy load, and could not move on the spot. At 10 am, the captain sent a telegram to Shanghai to report, saying that he was waiting for the tide to rise that night to try to get out of the shallows. This matter has been notified to the Shanghai Ship Insurance Association. The Yitaixing side is waiting for the Huashun ship's follow-up telegram to decide on a plan.</p>
<h3>The Pingshun and Beifu Collide in Tianjin Port Due to Ice and Shallow Water. Fortunately, the Loss is Not Very Heavy</h3>
<p>The Beifu, belonging to the Northern Shipping Company of this port, has a deadweight of 1,975 tons and travels between Shanghai, Tianjin, Yantai, and other places. It loaded cargo from Tianjin to Shanghai on the 16th of this month. When sailing in Tianjin Port, due to the cold weather and ice, the river was shallow. As it was moving forward, the Pingshun ship, managed by the Datongxing Shipping Company of this port, with a deadweight of 1,584 tons, sailed into Tianjin Port. The two ships met, and due to the shallow water, strong winds, and tidal surge, the two ships collided with each other when they approached, both of which were damaged. The two shipowners immediately inspected each other and reported to the Tianjin Customs. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Shanghai to report to the Shanghai Northern Company. The company also forwarded the telegram to the China Ship Insurance Association. The reporter inquired with Director Tang Danhua and the Northern Company. It was said that the extent of the damage was not too serious, and the cause of the accident and the amount of the loss would be known after the follow-up report.</p>
<h3>Disputes After the Failure of Japanese Smuggling Silver</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that Japanese people who smuggled silver out of Shanghai used to pay a protection fee to a certain Japanese organization, charging five yuan for every thousand yuan. Now, because some smugglers were seized by the Japanese Consulate police when a certain Japanese ship left Shanghai last Saturday and Sunday, the organization advertised in a Japanese newspaper in this port yesterday, asking the smugglers who failed to recover the fee at a certain Japanese hotel, No. 51 Youheng Road. If they do not pick it up by December 31, it will be donated to the Japanese Charity. It is reported that there were four people who organized the organization. According to the investigation by the Japanese Consulate police, they falsely claimed that they had obtained the Japanese authorities' understanding of smuggling, so they collected this fee, which was called a protection fee. On Monday morning, when the Russian-flagged Changxing Company's Okhotsk was about to leave for Vancouver, customs inspectors found a 16-year-old Japanese man among the passengers, carrying 1,300 silver dollars, all sewn into a specially made short jacket. Just as they were about to take him off the ship, many Japanese Consulate police officers saw him at the scene and argued with them. More than a hundred Japanese passengers in the ship rose up to help him, and there was an intense situation. An employee of the Changxing Company in this port came to the scene to mediate and took the clothes back to the company for safekeeping, pending a solution between the two parties. Then they reported the matter to the British and Japanese Consuls General, asking for instructions on how to deal with the clothes. The matter had not been resolved as of last night, so the clothes were still in the company's warehouse, awaiting the consuls' decision on whether to send them to the Japanese Consulate or to the customs for confiscation. The Shanghai Times reported that, according to Japanese newspapers in this port, an employee of the Changxing Company expressed dissatisfaction with the Western customs officers at the scene because customs inspectors found passengers smuggling silver on the ship. This matter has been resolved. The clothes and silver dollars have been returned to the Japanese man, but the Japanese consular police authorities have instructed him to exchange the silver dollars for paper money and take them back to his country. The customs officer has apologized to the Japanese officer.</p>

Due to his father's failing health and stomach ailments, Zheng Du'e has now decided to reallocate these funds to aid the victims of the severe flooding in various provinces, who are in dire need of assistance. As the amount of money was too large to gather quickly, he sold a rented property for over six hundred gold coins. His wife also contributed approximately two hundred gold coins by selling her clothing and jewelry. He also borrowed money from his relative, Mr. Pan, to make up the difference. On the eleventh of this month, he remitted this thousand yuan through the Fuzhou branch of the Bank of China to the Water Disaster Relief Association for verification and allocation to the flood victims in Shandong and Hebei provinces.</p>

<h3>Jinghu Railway - Rectifying Loading and Unloading Work at Wuxi Station</h3>
<p>On the 16th of this month, various newspapers in this city reported that the loading and unloading workers at Wuxi Station on the Jinghu Railway requested to continue their contracts and not to hold another bidding process. According to the person in charge of the railway, Meng Jingsun has been contracted to handle the loading and unloading work at the station for many years. This year, the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly received letters from loading and unloading workers and business circles at the station, detailing various illegal activities by Meng Jingsun, the contractor for loading and unloading, and Tao Ziming, the foreman. After investigation, it was found that the situation was complex, involving not only the interests of a few loading and unloading workers but also the entire contracting system, loading and unloading discipline, business reputation, and the welfare of general workers of the railway, which was very serious. The railway bureau was ordered to immediately terminate the original contract and solicit new bids. All previous practices of the loading and unloading personnel arbitrarily increasing fees and Tao Ziming's exploitation of workers should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with. This order arrived at the railway bureau in mid-October of this year, and the bureau immediately complied, setting the original contract to expire at the end of this year and soliciting new bids based on the Ministry of Railways' regulations for contracting the loading and unloading of railway goods. During this transition period, the original contractor, unwilling to relinquish his vested interests, resisted, which was expected. However, the railway bureau is determined to improve the situation in accordance with the ministry's order, taking into account the concerns of industry and commerce, and will not change its stance.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Association Convenes Branch Meetings - Large Petition to the Municipal Government This Morning</h3>
<p>The Municipal Rent Reduction Committee, in order to alleviate the burden on citizens, will hold a large-scale petition to the municipal government at 9:00 AM this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition:</p>
<p>The petition from the association states: "Presented for the purpose of promoting rent reduction and dispatching representatives such as Chen Jiufeng to petition your government, requesting guidance on rent reduction measures to maintain the people's housing and stabilize society. Since the association began promoting rent reduction, it has been in turmoil for many years. Although some landlords have voluntarily reduced rents, the reductions are scattered and uneven, and have not been widely adopted. Therefore, the people who have not received rent reductions look to your government to issue an order as soon as possible to reduce the burden on tenants for relief. We have specially appointed Chen Jiufeng, Wang Jingdong, Zhang Xianfang, and others as representatives to present a written statement to you, earnestly requesting an audience and showing our gratitude."</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Branches:</p>
<p>The association sent a letter to all its branches, requesting each branch to send a representative to participate in the petition. The original text reads: "Dear Sir/Madam, According to the resolution of the representatives' conference of all branches of the association, it is decided to convene at the association at 9:00 AM on Wednesday, the 18th of this month, to hold a large-scale petition to the municipal government, requesting the promulgation of explicit regulations on rent reduction. Correspondingly, we hereby inform you and hope that you will take note and send one representative at the appointed time, with a preparation for the carfare of one yuan in national currency, to the association to join the petition to the municipal government. The matter concerns the entire rent reduction issue. Please do not delay."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce - Instructions on Stamping Account Books</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied yesterday to Dong Shenghao's inquiry about stamping account books. The letter stated: "We received your letter of inquiry on the 16th of this month, inquiring about two points regarding the application of stamp tax. Our reply is as follows: Collecting accounts is one of the business activities, and these account books are used for mutual verification when collecting accounts. They cannot be said to be not used for business purposes. According to Article 16, Paragraph 11 of the Stamp Tax Law, stamps should be affixed. According to Article 5 of the Stamp Tax Law, documents subject to stamp tax should have stamp tax tickets affixed before delivery or use. Specifically, receipts should have stamps affixed before delivery, and account books should have stamps affixed before use. Therefore, once an account book is opened, it should have sufficient stamps affixed. Your letter stating that stamps should only be affixed at the time of use is a misunderstanding."</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming and Others Went to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wei Daoming, Yang Hu, Guan Suren, Ma Yinchu, and Zeng Yangfu took the night train to Nanjing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Executive Committee of the Goldsmiths' Guild - Proposed Third Submission to the Ministry to Request Revision of Silver Management Rules - Letter to the Police to Investigate the Case of Swapping Silver for Copper</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goldsmiths' Guild held an executive committee meeting at its premises yesterday afternoon. Nine executive committee members and five member representatives attended, chaired by Chuan Shengmao. First, the chairman reported receiving letters from colleagues in thirty-six counties in seven provinces regarding the silver issue, stating that they had all submitted requests to the Ministry of Finance to revise the management rules. The second resolution of the guild to submit to the Ministry of Finance has also been mailed to colleagues in various cities for reference. Subsequently, the proposals were discussed.</p>
<p>The guild's second submission to the Ministry of Finance has not yet been approved. It is proposed to make a third submission to request the approval of the "proviso" in Article 11 to avoid the panic of unemployment among hundreds of thousands of workers. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>According to a report from Yang Qinghe Fa Ji, a member, the Datong Gift Shop on Jiujiang Road replaced two silver commemorative cups with the Yang Qinghe Fa Ji brand, which customers had entrusted to them for polishing. The Datong Gift Shop instigated a coppersmith to imitate the style, and then welded on the cup feet with the Yang Qinghe brand, disguising the cups and deceiving society. This was discovered by a partner of Yang Qinghe, who caught them red-handed and sent them to the relevant police station, requesting legal action. The guild was asked to send a letter to the police requesting a thorough investigation and questioning to determine the number of past forgeries. The motion was passed unanimously, and a letter was immediately drafted. It is said that these forged utensils are all entrusted by customers to the gift shop for repair, and they privately replace the genuine ones with counterfeits. The number is quite large, and perhaps Datong is not the only one doing this. If this continues, the members of the guild, whether members or not, will suffer injustice, and the consequences will be endless, not to mention the impact on business. In the future, anyone who entrusts silverware to gift shops for repair should inspect it themselves to avoid being deceived, and they should pursue compensation for losses from the repair shops. Other cases were omitted. The letter from the guild to the police is also recorded below: "Dear Sir/Madam, Our member, Yang Qinghe Fa Ji Goldsmith, discovered on the 14th of this month that two silver commemorative cups had been forged. The forger is the Datong Gift Shop at No. 482 Jiujiang Road. The shop largely removed the upper part of the Yang Qinghe Fa Ji brand silver commemorative cup and replaced it with copper, still using the Yang Qinghe brand cup feet to deceive society. We have already reported this to your police station. Our guild convened a general meeting of all members yesterday, and everyone believed that since this forgery by Datong Gift Shop has been discovered, there must be many more that have not been discovered. If a thorough investigation is not conducted and strict legal action is not taken, it will not be enough to deter imitators. Most of our member goldsmiths' shops are located under your police station's jurisdiction. These disguised, genuine-branded fakes will inevitably lead to disputes with the original brand goldsmiths in the future, and the goldsmith industry will suffer injustice and endless harm. Our member goldsmiths' shops are all in a state of trepidation. We hope that you will arrest the coppersmith who made the replacement and the owner of Datong for questioning to determine not only the number of replacements made by Datong but also whether other gift shops are doing the same. For this reason, we request that the detective chief investigate in detail to prevent legitimate businesses from suffering unexpected losses and to prevent lawbreakers from escaping justice. We earnestly request that your detective chief strictly arrest and prosecute them according to the law, which would be just."</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Winter Shelter - The Municipal Government Allocated 2,000 Yuan - Over a Thousand Refugees Admitted Daily - Currently Negotiating with Lumber Merchants to Borrow Planks to Build Shelters</h3>
<p>The temporary winter shelter in Shanghai South, organized by the Shanghai Charity Federation, has already begun admitting people at the Chaozhou Guild Hall in the South Railway Station. As of yesterday, the number of registered people admitted totaled over nine hundred, with another four hundred unregistered people, totaling over one thousand three hundred people. The registration and inspection areas are extremely crowded. More and more people are continuously arriving to seek shelter. The area along the Station Road is filled with people without clothes or food, all requesting admission. The president of the association, Wang Yiting, believes that the number of people to be sheltered this year will be higher than in previous years. He has sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance and instructed cadres Zhang Zixin and Chen Yousheng to negotiate with Shen, Wei Shanfu, and other enthusiastic lumber merchant leaders to borrow 20,000 feet of foreign pine planks to design and build additional shelters and dining facilities. The lumber industry association has agreed to lend the planks. The second shelter being prepared at the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road has been searching for additional buildings for days, and they have received permission from Director Yang of the Security Department to have the security team stationed there relocate immediately, so that the shelter can be quickly arranged, expanded, and provide as much relief as possible. Yesterday, donations continued to be received from various sectors, including 1,000 yuan allocated from the Water Disaster Relief Association's relief fund, 300 yuan from the Flour Exchange, and cotton clothing donated by Mr. Wang Xida.</p>
<h3>Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly Opens and Distributes Congee</h3>
<p>The Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly on Anna King Road in the French Concession of this city is dedicated to charity, benefiting the common people in every way. Every summer, it provides medical treatment and medicine, and in winter, it sets up a factory to distribute congee, which has been going on for several years. This winter, due to the early cold weather, the congee distribution is still following the old practice, starting at the Yongsheng Hall in Xieqiao. However, in view of the increase in the number of common people receiving congee last winter, reaching over ten thousand people, they are now rushing to build reed sheds and repair stoves and pots in order to accommodate as many people as possible. Their enthusiasm for serving society is commendable.</p>
<h3>Young and Ignorant Female Worker Deceived</h3>
<p>Peng Zhaodi, a 17-year-old girl from Tongzhou with some beauty, lived on Qiqihar Road and worked as a female worker at the Shanghai Fifth Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. At 4:00 PM on the 26th of last month, she went to the factory to collect her wages and was deceived by Gao Chen, a woman from Funing, a neighbor, to stay temporarily at a relative's place on Yangzhou Road. Gao Chen falsely claimed that since her family was poor, she would find her a suitable husband so she could eat well and dress well. The girl, being young and ignorant, did not understand the conspiracy and stayed for a week without meeting anyone suitable. On the 1st of this month, Gao Chen took her to a bungalow at Shi's brother's place on Maigen Road. Shi had a fellow villager named Cheng Tingzhu, over 20 years old and still unmarried. He came to flirt with Zhaodi, and Shi acted as a matchmaker. Peng ended up in the trap. Because Shi's family was inconvenient for such a matter, on the 10th, Shi instigated her daughter, Gendi, to take Peng Zhaodi and Cheng Tingzhu out for fun, and they opened room number four at the Laigen Hotel on the same road and stayed overnight, where Zhaodi was raped. The next morning at 8:00 AM, they rented a small house nearby to live together as husband and wife. Peng Buyun, the girl's father, had been searching everywhere for Zhaodi since her disappearance, but without any news. He reported the situation to the Yulin Road police station, which dispatched Chinese detective Liu Chunshu to investigate. Liu learned the whereabouts of the group. At noon the day before yesterday, he secretly went to the address with Peng Buyun and arrested Cheng. After questioning, he learned that Chen had facilitated the matter and arrested Chen as well, bringing them and Peng Zhaodi to the police station. The girl was handed over to her father. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special First Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, presented the case, filing a public prosecution for the crime of disrupting marriage and family. After Peng Buyun and his daughter testified about the details, Gao Chen, when questioned, admitted to the accusations but made all sorts of excuses. Cheng Tingzhu confessed that Gendi had invited him to the hotel to act as a matchmaker and that Peng Zhaodi had voluntarily followed him as his wife, begging for leniency. Judge Lan Shuzi ordered them to be detained separately and set a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Luodian Fresh Meat Industry Strike - Has Affected the Entire County</h3>
<p>The fresh meat merchants in Luodian Town, Baoshan, previously went on strike to demand a reduction in slaughter tax, which was reported in the newspapers. It has been learned that all townships in the county have also responded in succession due to the common interests of the industry. Therefore, since the day before yesterday, fresh meat has been unavailable for purchase throughout the county. The county's party and government organs are currently trying to mediate.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications - Technologist Qian Gongnan Returns to China</h3>
<p>Qian Gongnan, a technologist of the Ministry of Communications, was ordered last year to go to England to supervise the construction of long-distance telephone equipment for nine provinces and to visit France, Germany, and the United States to inspect telecommunications administration.

<h3>Silk Dyeing Industry Implements Price Increase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Dyeing Industry Association recently faced a sharp increase in the prices of its main supplies, "pigments" and "coal." The price of pigments continued to rise, and there was even a shortage of supply, leading to high costs and making it difficult to maintain operations. The usual dyeing prices were already very low. Occasionally, one or two silk shops, unaware of this situation, deliberately deducted prices, causing business to plummet and almost leading to bankruptcy. Now, after the central government implemented the legal tender, the economy has changed accordingly. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered all members to convene a pricing meeting to set appropriate price lists and submit them for record to prevent disruption of the market economy. The industry decided that dyeing prices would be adjusted based on the rise and fall of raw material prices. Since raw material prices continue to rise, it is necessary to discuss price increases to provide some relief. A pricing committee was appointed to make recommendations, and after several considerations, a general meeting of all members was convened yesterday to decide on an increase plan. All members will increase the standard dyeing prices of various silk shops and silk gangs by four points to temporarily maintain the status quo and protect their capital. The restrictions on the length of silk pieces will be decided later. The aforementioned price increase resolution has been reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record and will be implemented from the date of the newspaper announcement. At the same time, all silk shops and silk gangs are notified to understand and increase prices accordingly. All members are notified to comply. If anyone deliberately raises prices or secretly reduces the price increase standard, the association will punish them severely in accordance with the punishment measures of the Municipal Government's Order No. 16162 and will not be lenient in order to maintain business. It is said that in order to prevent the malpractice of raising or lowering prices during the settlement period between members in the future, the association will dispatch staff to lead the settlement and strictly inspect. If the silk party adheres to bad habits and still deducts prices, the association will take a firm stance, actively plan serious countermeasures, and strive to deal with it consistently and fully to consolidate unity.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested on Luxiangyuan Road</h3>
<p>At 5:30 PM yesterday, Dong Mingde, captain of the 16th Shiliupu Detective Team, and Xu Yaocheng, deputy captain, learned that a gang of robbers was hiding near the Nine Mu Di in the city. They immediately led squad leader Wu Songshan, Liu Lingsheng, detectives Yuan Hansan, Yuan Mingcai, Yuan Zhigang, Wu Dianli, Li Fatong, Wang Guilin, temporary detectives Sun Guangyan, Li Guisheng, and others to encircle and arrest them. It was not until 9:20 PM that they learned that the robbers were hiding at No. 42 Ren'an Lane, Luxiangyuan Road. They immediately entered the premises to make the arrests. One of the robbers was about to draw his gun to resist arrest when a detective bravely stepped forward and seized the eight-inch revolver from the robber's hand before arresting all three robbers and escorting them to the team headquarters. Six bullets, a bunch of keys, and other items were found on the robbers. The three robbers were: Zhang Xiaopi, 31 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at Yaojia Stone Bridge in Zhabei; Yang Yukang (alias Xiao Asan), 31 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 44 Wangzhi Road in the French Concession; Tian Jinhai, 30 years old, a local, residing at No. 43 Ren'an Lane, Luxiangyuan Road. According to Zhang's confession, five or six days ago, he and Yang and Tian robbed a cigarette paper shop opened by Zhou Hegan at No. 27 Ruifu Lane, opposite Zi Jiahuo Street in the French Concession, and shared the stolen silver dollars. He also confessed that the gun was given to him by the robber Wan Dabao, who is currently hiding at No. 4, Lane 83, Zhejiang Road. After receiving the confession, Captain Dong immediately took the detectives, carrying Zhang, and joined the Chinese and Western detectives from the Laozha Police Station to assist in the arrest. They safely arrested the robber Wan Dabao in the front building of the厢房. He was handed over to the Special First Court by the police station, while the other three robbers were taken back to the 16th Shiliupu Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Rampant Child Abduction in Zhabei - Seven-Year-Old Boy Pan Langen Abducted</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent incidents of child abduction in Zhabei. Although the relevant public security bureau has issued orders to all detective teams to strictly investigate and arrest abductors, Pan Zhou Shun's seven-year-old son, Pan Langen, of No. 2 Yuqing Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, was also abducted by bandits a few days ago. Because his parents were crying day and night over the loss of their beloved son, the principal of a certain elementary school, feeling pity for them, wrote to the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting them to order their subordinates to investigate.</p>
<h3>Fire on Huayi Street in Nanshi</h3>

<h3>Shanghai First - Pilot Program for Notary System - Central Political Council Resolves to Pilot for Two Years</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported that Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, had previously proposed a pilot program for the notary system and planned to first pilot it in Shanghai. According to sources in the judicial circle, if the notary system can be widely implemented, it will provide an additional avenue for resolving disputes between parties in civil litigation. Righteous parties have no way to prove their righteousness, and both parties in a dispute will inevitably argue. Therefore, notarization is sufficient to resolve disputes between the two parties and is helpful to the law enforcement authorities. Ju's proposal has been resolved by the Central Political Council, setting the pilot period to two years and designating Shanghai as the pilot area. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has drafted the Notary Fee Collection Rules, etc., which are expected to be prepared this month. In the middle of next month, a judge from the Municipal District Court will be assigned to handle the pilot notary system, and a clerk will be attached to assist the judge in handling the pilot notary system.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau - Introducing Domestic Products</h3>

<p>The Dutch N.V. Company needs tin ingots. Please introduce them to tin mining companies.</p>

The terms of the transaction are 90 days, with bank guarantees and bills of exchange commercial credit. Inquiries can be made at the Shanghai HSBC Bank.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Smokers to be Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fined; Public Security Bureau Issues Final Notice to Smokers; 30,230 Registered Smokers in the City</h3>
<p>The citywide final inspection of smokers conducted by the Municipal Public Security Bureau continued yesterday. Each branch bureau and the Water Patrol Team are supervising their subordinates to work diligently, arresting opium offenders, and searching opium dens. Due to the overall mobilization of land and water forces, the inspection is proving more effective. There are only thirteen days left (until the end of the month) until the deadline. At the same time, the anti-smoking propaganda team is also working hard on promotion.</p>
<p>Total Number of Registrations</p>
<p>Smoker registration started by the Public Security Bureau in July. As of last week, the confirmed number of registrations is 26,230 with licenses, 10,454 with ordinary licenses, and 15,776 with indigent licenses. 4,000 registered to quit smoking, of which 2,677 have been sent to hospitals for treatment, and 1,323 have not yet been sent for treatment. The total number of registered smokers is 30,230.</p>
<p>Notice to Smokers</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has announced that the deadline for compulsory registration is the end of the year. After the deadline, if unregistered smokers are found, they will not be issued quit-smoking licenses and will be sent to military tribunals to be sentenced to imprisonment for six months to two years, with a fine of up to 300 yuan. The punishment is extremely severe, so smokers should quickly register during this last opportunity. The bureau issued a final notice to smokers yesterday, saying: "Fellow smokers, it has been more than five months since the city began implementing the smoking ban. We have transitioned from a period of voluntary registration to a period of compulsory registration, and the compulsory registration period, which is scheduled to end at the end of this year, is about to expire. After the deadline, how will unregistered smokers be dealt with? I believe this is what unregistered smokers urgently want to know, and it is the Public Security Bureau’s duty to inform them. I would like to take this opportunity, as the compulsory registration is about to expire, to briefly explain the handling of unregistered smokers as a final, sincere warning. Previously, the Municipal Government received an order from the Chairman’s Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, stipulating that smokers in this city must complete registration by the end of this year, with no further extensions. Naturally, we must comply with this order. After the registration is completed, if this bureau discovers any unregistered smokers, regardless of whether they are old or sick, they will all be denied quit-smoking licenses and sent to military tribunals to be sentenced to imprisonment for eight months to two years, with a fine of up to 300 yuan, in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium Offenses. Those with opium addiction will be given a deadline to see a doctor and ordered to quit. This is stipulated by law and cannot be lenient. At that time, even if you want to register and quit smoking at your leisure, it will be impossible. Think carefully, is it better to surrender and register now, or to be punished in the future? Needless to say, you will definitely be able to distinguish clearly. Now there are only ten days left until the registration deadline. These ten days are the last chance for unregistered smokers. The advantages and disadvantages of registering or not registering have been explained clearly above. Unregistered smokers should take advantage of these ten days to quickly surrender and register with the Municipal Public Security Bureau. This will not only exempt you from fines but also allow you to quit at your leisure. If you continue to be stubborn and attempt to hide, you will be disobeying orders. After the compulsory registration deadline, if any unregistered smokers are found, they will be punished severely without hesitation. By then, you will likely regret it too late. Therefore, all unregistered smokers, upon seeing this notice, must carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages and make a prompt decision. Do not hesitate and mislead yourselves. I have said all that needs to be said. Take heed."</p>
<h3>Wire Mesh Made into a Cardboard Box; Husband and Wife Dress Up to Steal as a Team; Entering and Exiting Major Stores, Stealing in Between and Hiding Items in the Box; Exposed for Stealing a Raincoat in a Russian Store on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>The husband and wife thieves Liu Yingyuan (30 years old, from Guangdong) and Liu Fengying (26 years old, from Taicang) reside at No. 5 Sanle Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. Due to their luxurious clothing, extravagant behavior, and excellent skills, they specialize in using their team-stealing techniques in major companies and stores in the northern and southern parts of the city. The husband and wife travel together, making this their profession, and have never been caught. Their method involves using wire mesh to create a frame resembling a modern Western-style clothing store's enlarged coat cardboard box. The frame is wrapped with thin cotton and covered with the store's trademark wrapping paper. At first glance, it looks like a newly purchased fashionable clothing package. The husband and wife carry this treasure to various companies and stores under the pretense of buying clothing. During the selection process, they take advantage of moments when people are not paying attention to put the stolen items into their treasure and leave with their heads held high. Their technique is exquisite, and their skills are excellent. Since they started operating in Shanghai, they have never been caught. However, heaven's net is vast, and they were finally exposed and arrested. The Liu couple went to a clothing store opened by a Russian named Shisilefsky (transliteration) at No. 859 Avenue Joffre at 3 PM on the 14th under the guise of purchasing rubber raincoats. They selected dozens of items, but none were to their liking. When the store clerk checked the number of clothes, one was missing. The clerk chased after them and stopped the Liu couple, calling the police. A search revealed nothing on the couple's persons. Finally, they opened their treasure, and the stolen item was indeed inside. They had no way to escape. The police took the couple and the stolen goods to the police station for detention. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo interrogated them in the Criminal Court. Because the lawyer from the Police Affairs Office requested an extension to investigate the number of cases committed by the defendants and to check the stolen goods, the court approved the request. After briefly questioning the defendants, the hearing was adjourned to a later date. The defendants were taken back into custody.</p>

<h3>Rare Chilean Black Cat Travels Over 10,000 Miles; Gift from a Chilean to the Wife of the U.S. Consul General in Hankou, Arrives in Shanghai and Flies to Hankou Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, when the President Hayes arrived in Shanghai on Sunday, its captain was carrying a rare Chilean-Persian hybrid black cat, a gift from someone in the capital of Chile to the wife of Consul Garvis of the U.S. Consulate General in Hankou. Because live animals cannot be sent as packages, it was shipped as cargo on the Gres company's ship Santa Rosa and charged accordingly. The cat traveled over 12,000 miles on two ships. When the ship reached Balboa in the Suez Canal area, the cat escaped and went ashore. Because it was a pedigree, the city police were asked to look for it. After three weeks, nothing was found, but many black cats were arrested and sent to the police station for identification. When there was no hope of finding it, it was suddenly discovered. At that time, it was too late to transfer it to the President Lincoln, so it was transferred to the President Hayes to Shanghai. Captain Pearson was deeply concerned that the cat's free nature would cause it to escape again, so he placed it in his bedroom and carefully guarded it, not allowing it to leave the room until Monday morning, when the cat was finally enjoying itself on the deck with its new owner. This morning (17th) at 7 o'clock, it will board a China National Aviation Corporation plane and fly to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Court Investigates in Detail the Strange Corpse in Empty House Case; Police Summon Neighbors for Questioning</h3>
<p>A seven- or eight-year-old girl was found hanging herself on the floorboard wall of the third floor of an empty house at No. 685 Baoshan Road, Zhabei. The local warden reported this to the Procuratorate of the District Court, which sent someone to examine the body. As no family members came forward to claim it, the court ordered that a coffin be provided for burial. Because the case was bizarre, the caretaker Zhou Jinrong was ordered to come to the court the next day for questioning to thoroughly investigate the situation, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the eighteen buildings along the road, including the residences in Tong'an Lane, are the property of Tongfu Company at No. 2 Baoxing Lane, Baoshan Road, and the company hired Zhou Jinrong from Shaoxing as the caretaker. It was found that the empty house where the incident occurred had been vacant for three months. The two buildings to its left and right were also empty. The afternoon before yesterday, neighbors Pang Songmao and the 金, 丁, and 嚴 families, a total of four households, reported that they had heard strange noises coming from the empty house late at night. Feeling this was unusual, they informed the caretaker Zhou Jinrong, who entered from the back door. However, the front and back doors were still closed as usual, and he did not suspect anything else. Only after learning about the discovery of the body did they realize that the sun deck door was open. The deceased may have entered from the back sun deck. However, it is obvious that there is more to the story of how a young girl came to hang herself here. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Zhou Jinrong complied with the order and went to the court, where he was questioned at length by Prosecutor Zhang Zi. As a result, he was ordered to leave and wait for instructions. The police station in charge of this case is paying special attention to it. Yesterday, it ordered the residents of No. 673, No. 677, No. 679, and No. 681 on the street to come to the station for questioning in the hope of uncovering the truth.</p>
<h3>Li Guoxiang Not Guilty in the Robbery and Murder of an Indian Moneylender; Investigation Confirms He Did Not Participate in the Robbery</h3>
<p>On the morning of October 15th, at 7 a.m., armed robbers broke into the home of Indian moneylender Nusek Singh (transliteration), who lived upstairs at No. 1033 Avenue Foch. The victim's wife, Pi Shengtieke (transliteration), tried to stop them, which angered the robbers. She was shot in a vital spot and died instantly. The robbers, unable to search for valuables, fled in panic. The victim saw his wife shot and killed and followed them out, calling for the police. Detectives arrived upon hearing the commotion and tried to apprehend the robbers. Because the robbers fired shots along the way to resist arrest, one robber was shot and killed by detectives in front of No. 9 Maizhao Road. A Browning pistol was recovered, containing several bullets, and a suspect named Li Guoxiang (32 years old, from Jiangbei, resident of No. 4 Gubao Road, a rickshaw driver) was arrested. The French Concession Police examined his fingerprints and found that Li had previously committed theft in the Public Concession and had been punished. He was sent to the Second Special Court, where the Police Affairs Office filed a public prosecution. The victim, Nusek Singh, identified Li as one of the robbers who participated in the robbery and requested that he be severely punished. Judge Zhang Chaozuo repeatedly held court hearings. The defendant repeatedly protested his innocence, saying that he was only going to watch when he heard the commotion, which led to his arrest. He also presented evidence to the contrary. The presiding judge, in order to be cautious, went to the scene of the incident and the location where the robber was killed to investigate in detail. He also ordered detectives to take the defendant to the above-mentioned locations to demonstrate what happened at the time, in order to avoid any injustice. He also appointed a lawyer to defend the defendant and announced the end of the hearing and scheduled a date for the verdict, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the investigation of the case confirmed that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. Yesterday, the verdict was announced. At 10 a.m., Judge Zhang of the Second Special Court went to Criminal Court No. 1 and ordered the defendant to be brought to the case and announced the verdict that Li Guoxiang was not guilty. The pistol was confiscated, and the defendant was ordered to be detained in the detention center during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Tangshan Road Yuanji Lane Rent Dispute Goes to Court; Landlord and Tenants Hold to Their Own Opinions; Hearing Concluded Yesterday, Verdict Scheduled for a Later Date</h3>
<p>The houses in the Yuanji Lane area of Tangshan Road, Hongkou, were built by the Real Estate Department of the Ningpo Commercial Bank and leased to others. Recently, Zhang Guoliang, a resident of No. 102 in the lane, argued that the rent in the lane was more expensive than in the nearby Fuhua Lane, Zunde Lane, and other places. Therefore, in May of this year, he sent a letter to the Real Estate Department of the Ningpo Commercial Bank requesting a rent reduction, but received no satisfactory response. As a result, Zhang stopped paying rent. Recently, the legal representative of the Ningpo Commercial Bank filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District against Zhang Guoliang for unpaid rent and eviction. Zhang also joined forces with all the tenants in the lane to form a rent reduction association and hired lawyers such as Jiang Baoli to represent them and file a counterclaim. They argued that the Shanghai market was currently sluggish, land prices had plummeted, and landlords everywhere were voluntarily reducing rents. Therefore, they requested that the rent be reduced by 40% from June of this year and that the court order a rent reduction in accordance with Article 422 of the Civil Code. Yesterday afternoon, the court opened the hearing. The defendant's attorney presented various reasons. The presiding judge reviewed the evidence and ordered the closing arguments. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Rong'an Inn Smashes Human Trafficking Ring; Two Abducted Children Recovered</h3>
<p>Ni Wanshi (transliteration), director of the Moral Customs Department of the French Concession Police, received a tip-off the day before yesterday, saying that there was a human trafficking ring hiding in the Rong'an Inn at No. 30 Orlihe Road. He immediately led detectives to the Rong'an Inn and arrested Zhang Yougen (30 years old, from Nanjing) and his wife Zhang Tangshi (28 years old) in room No. 3, and recovered two abducted children. One child, Xiao Hong, is eight years old, from Taizhou, wearing a red and white foreign-style cotton-padded jacket with blue sleeves and black-gray cotton pants, black leather shoes, a square face, and a red and white student cap. The other child is only three years old and could not provide his name when questioned. The traffickers claimed that the children were their own and not abducted, but the children's faces were different from theirs. They also claimed that the eight-year-old male child was temporarily entrusted to them by someone named 甲, who was on the run. Their words were evasive. They were immediately taken back to the police station for detention, pending investigation and notification of the families of the missing children, and the pursuit of the escaped traffickers. The case will be transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Protagonist of the Affair with the Chauffeur, Xi Yunqing, Radiates with Health and Beauty; Divorce Case Heard in Court; Xi Expresses Hope for Reconciliation but with Conditions; Husband Liu Zirong Insists on Divorce</h3>
<p>Liu Zirong, 23 years old, son of Liu Huizhi, former General Manager of the China Industrial Bank, is a student at St. John's University. His wife, Xi Yunqing (also known as Xueqing), is the daughter of real estate magnate Xi Eheng. They have been married for several years and have one child. However, although Xi is a lady from a prominent family, her love life is not very devoted. She developed an inextricable relationship with the family's chauffeur, Wu Wenxiang. On August 2nd of this year, after a conflict with her husband Liu Zirong at home, she secretly ran away and rented a house with Wu Wenxiang in the French Concession. After his wife fled, Zirong searched for her while hiring a lawyer to file a divorce lawsuit with the District Court of the First Special District.</p>
<p>Divorce Lawsuit</p>
<p>Recently, their whereabouts were discovered, and the police were immediately dispatched to arrest them and send them to the Procuratorate of the Shanghai District Court for investigation and prosecution. In the divorce case, the First Special Court initially allowed a public announcement because the defendant's address was unknown. Now that Xi has been arrested, the presiding judge, Peng Shi, after holding a preliminary hearing, ordered that she be transferred from the Shanghai District Court for further examination. Yesterday afternoon, the continued hearing was held. The defendant, Xi Yunqing, was brought to the Fourth Tribunal of the First Special Court by car. She was wearing a cheongsam and leather shoes, with a light gray woolen coat.</p>
<p>Radiating with Health and Beauty</p>
<p>She showed no signs of fatigue. The case was considered an interesting anecdote, so many people came to court to listen. At 3:30, Judge Peng took the bench and first asked the plaintiff Liu Zirong and the defendant Xi Yunqing for their names, ages, native places, and addresses. He then said, "According to the law, divorce cases must first go through a conciliation process. Let's proceed with conciliation now." Liu then said that the other party had expressed a desire for conciliation, but it had not yet taken place. He said, "We may as well try now." Xi also immediately stated, "I want conciliation." She then described in detail her marriage to Liu and the details of</p>
<p>Her Flight</p>
<p>"I admit that I cohabitated with Wu Wenxian," she said. She stated that she was 25 years old and married Liu Zirong on the 18th day of the 12th lunar month in 1931. A child was born in August 1933. On August 2nd of this year, she had an argument with Liu at their home on Yuyuan Road over money. She then ran away in anger and rented a place in the French Concession by herself, without returning to her mother's home. She only took 500 to 600 yuan of her private property with her, nothing else. On the 22nd day of the 10th lunar month, she met the chauffeur Wu Wenxiang while shopping at the Sincere Company. She told him her address because he asked. On the morning of the 1st day of the 11th lunar month, Wu came to borrow money. Unexpectedly, the police followed him and arrested them together. But she and Wu have no real relationship. Now the plaintiff</p>
<p>Demands a Divorce</p>
<p>"I don't want to divorce because I can't bear to leave my three-year-old child. However, I request conciliation, but the conditions for conciliation are: (1) The plaintiff must provide a certain amount of money each month; (2) The plaintiff must no longer run wild outside," she said. Liu Zirong said that when they were caught, Xi and Wu Wenxiang were still sleeping together, so he insisted on a divorce and that the defendant must return all the jewelry and money she had taken. Then, the lawyers for both the plaintiff and the defendant argued with each other, both advocating for a postponement of the case, pending the resolution of the adultery case still under investigation by the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate, before considering</p>
<p>Methods of Conciliation</p>
<p>If conciliation fails, they will abide by the court's decision. Judge Peng then ordered the hearing to be adjourned until the afternoon of January 17th next year. The defendant, Xi Yunqing, was still sent back to the Shanghai District Court by car. Xi stated that she was unable to pay for the round-trip transportation and requested that Liu Zirong pay for it. Liu initially seemed unwilling, saying that he had already suffered great losses and did not want to continue to sacrifice. However, the car fare was not much, and after being persuaded by his lawyer, he agreed to pay it.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Hardoon Sued; Hardoon's Relatives Request Division of Estate; Reconciliation Attempted, Later Failed</h3>
<p>According to the Da Mei Wan Bao, Esra Hardoon has again filed a lawsuit with the British Court in China against the late Shanghai tycoon Hardoon's wife, claiming entitlement to the estate. The court has issued a summons and the case is expected to be heard by Chief Justice Mossop in early January. The plaintiff has retained lawyer Harris. The purpose of the claim is to distribute the estate in accordance with Iraqi law, as the late Hardoon was Iraqi and not British. Previously, another Esra Hardoon (with the same surname as the current plaintiff) also petitioned the British Court to divide Hardoon's estate under Iraqi law. In July 1932, Chief Justice Peter ruled that the late Hardoon was a British Protected Person, and therefore his estate should be disposed of by the British Court. The Hardoon relatives in Baghdad were unwilling to accept this and formed a group to continue their struggle. They sent Esra Hardoon (the current plaintiff) to London to consult with British lawyers, and then came to Shanghai in January 1934. In October of last year, they filed a lawsuit with the British Court, but the two sides agreed to a peaceful settlement, and the case was dropped. Mrs. Hardoon invited many of those who had come to Shanghai from Baghdad to tea parties and banquets several times. Initially, a satisfactory solution seemed possible, but the terms proposed could not be accepted by both parties, and so the settlement failed. It is said that Mrs. Hardoon has hired Lyall to defend her, assisted by a Hong Kong lawyer. Esra Hardoon claims to be a close relative of the late Hardoon and should inherit the estate under the law. It is expected that there will be a great deal of contention when the case is heard.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Recovers Operations of the Wuxi-Liyang and Wuxi-Jiangyin Routes</h3>
<p>After the contracts for the inland routes of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSN) with the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province expired and were recovered for self-management, some routes were still managed by merchants under subleases from the Construction Department, as the contracts had not yet expired. It is now known that the Wuxi-Liyang and Wuxi-Jiangyin routes were leased to Zhonghua Hengyu Ji. Now that the lease has expired, the CMSN has decided to recover the operations for self-management. Manager Chen Weiqing of the CMSN went to Wuxi to take over the ships, and Zhuang Zhijun was appointed as the manager. Self-management began on the 6th. The ship schedules are: Wuxi-Jiangyin - one trip daily; Wuxi-Liyang - one trip every other day. According to Mr. Chen, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the fares for both routes will remain the same for the time being. However, there are only two ships currently available on these two routes, which seems insufficient for the demand. He will do his best to develop the operations.</p>

<h3>Overview of Shanghai Company Businesses</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit Information Bureau</p>
<p>Shanghai's Cement Industry</p>
<p>(I) Introduction Cement is a modern emerging industry and one of the three major elements in modern construction projects. Before the invention of cement, the "clay mixture" used as a substitute was far less strong and aesthetically pleasing than cement. When used in sluices and embankments, it was easily washed away by water. Since the invention of the cement industry, the world's architecture has been renewed. Previously, China's cement was all imported from overseas. It was not until the late Guangxu period that the Qixin Cement Company took over the cement plant attached to the British-owned Kaiping Mining Bureau. Subsequently, the China Merchants Cement Company and the China Cement Company were also established successively. However, because the matter was in its initial stages, the products were not refined, and the output was limited. At the same time, domestic demand was increasing day by day, so foreign goods continued to be imported vigorously. When the European War broke out, Europe and the United States had no time to look east, and the domestic cement industry once flourished. After the end of the European War, various countries restored their East Asian markets, and cement imports showed a vibrant atmosphere again. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, the import volume increased year by year, and the annual loss was always more than two million taels. After the twenty-first year, the national economic panic became increasingly profound, and the real estate and construction industries in this city fell sharply. In July of the twenty-third year, the government raised the customs import tax rate again, and the import volume decreased sharply. However, this year's import volume has increased again compared with the same period last year. It is said that a certain agency in our country ordered a large number of foreign goods and was allowed to import them duty-free. In recent years, domestic cement has also fallen into a slump along with foreign goods. Since the recent promulgation of the new currency policy by the Ministry of Finance, the market seems to be on the road to recovery. If the real estate industry can gradually become active, the construction industry will inevitably develop accordingly, and the future of the cement industry should have a turning point.</p>
<p>(II) Historical Development An investigation reveals that China's cement plants originated with the cement manufacturing plant attached to the British Kaiping Mining Bureau, which was in the second year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1876 in the Western calendar). This was the beginning of the cement manufacturing industry in China. However, due to poor internal management, the sales of products were greatly hindered, resulting in huge losses. In the thirty-third year of Guangxu (1907 in the Western calendar), the factory had no intention of operating and was taken over by Chinese merchants, who renamed it Qixin Cement Company. The following year, the Qing government established the Guangdong Cement Plant in Guangzhou. In the second year of Xuantong (1910 in the Western calendar), the Hubei Province also established the Daye Cement Plant. Later, due to business losses, it was merged into the Qixin Cement Company in the third year of the Republic of China and renamed Huaji Hubei Cement Company. After the outbreak of the European War, the import of foreign cement disappeared, and the domestic cement industry gradually showed a booming atmosphere. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Liu Hongsheng and others initiated the organization of the Shanghai China Merchants Cement Company in Longhua, which was established in December of the same year. In June of the following year, it was registered with the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and shipments began in August of the twelfth year of the Republic of China. The next one was the China Cement Company in Longtan, Nanjing, which was established in August of the tenth year of the Republic of China and registered in November of the same year. Shipments began in the thirteenth year. Later, it acquired all the machinery of the Taihu Cement Company in Wuxi, which was founded in the twelfth year, and built a new factory. In the eighteenth year, the Guangdong Provincial Government established the Xicun Cement Plant near Guangzhou because the construction of the Yuehan Railway required a large amount of cement. The preparations for the Zhongzhi Cement Company in Jilin Province had been completed, but were suddenly terminated due to the September 18th Incident. Since then, no new companies have been founded in China. Recently, it has been heard that many government officials and industrial leaders plan to organize a large-scale cement company in Nanjing, and have selected Qixia Mountain as the factory site, named "Jiangnan Cement Company" with a capital of 2.4 million yuan. Construction will begin soon. If the Chinese people can work together in the future, the domestic cement will be enough to supply itself, and the annual loss of millions of yuan can be stopped.</p>
<p>(III) Types and Raw Materials Cement can be divided into three types: natural cement; volcanic cement; Portland cement. The cement produced by China's cement plants is all the third type, Portland cement, and the manufacturing process described in this article is also biased towards this type.</p>
<p>As for the raw materials for manufacturing cement, there are three types: clay, which is best if it does not contain much iron and alkali. The clay used by Shanghai companies is mined from Sheshan, Songjiang; China's is mined near the factory. Limestone, which is best if it does not contain magnesium or only contains traces. Shanghai uses limestone from Chenwan Mountain in Changxing; China uses limestone from nearby. Gypsum, most of the gypsum used by factories in China is ordered from Hamburg, Germany, or Mexico. Yingcheng County in Hubei Province, China, also produces gypsum, but due to its poor quality and frequent interruptions in supply, it must be supplied by foreign countries. In addition, coal, as a fuel, is also important. The amount of coal required by each factory accounts for one-third of the finished product. Most of the coal used by factories is coal dust from Kailuan, Lieshan, Zhongxing, and Hongqi. The Chinese and Shanghai factories suffer considerable losses in freight due to the long distance from the coal mines. The Qixin factory uses coal from nearby, so the cost is lower.</p>
<p>An investigation reveals that the Shanghai company needs about 30,000 tons of clay, more than 100,000 tons of limestone, and more than 2,000 tons of gypsum annually. The China company needs about 40,000 tons of clay, more than 100,000 tons of limestone, and 4,000 tons of gypsum annually. The above two factories need a total of 80,000 to 90,000 tons of fuel annually. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Last Night's YMCA Basketball Jianan Defeated Donghua The Winner was Decided in Overtime Jianan Won 36 to 34</h3>
<p>——Three Matches for Group A and B Tonight——</p>
<p>The Jianan basketball team defeated Donghua 36 to 34 in overtime last night with two successful free throws by Yao Yaoluo, creating a great record of five wins in five games at the YMCA. Jianan led throughout the game. In the end, Wang Nanzhen and Yin Guiren were fouled out of the game successively, and the lineup was slightly disrupted, which was taken advantage of by Donghua to tie the score at 32 to 32. Then, they exceeded by two points, and the situation was precarious. Later, they still won the victory with their last efforts, but it was quite painstaking.</p>
<p>Both Teams Lacked Calmness in Shooting Both sides used individual marking methods to facilitate the attack. Jianan team members are young and strong, and their strength lies in their fast running and passing. Donghua took a clever approach, so the competition was fierce. However, in a hurry, both teams lacked calmness in shooting and often missed the basket, which made the audience feel sorry for them.</p>
<p>Jianan Led by Three Points After the start of the game, Jianan took the lead and scored seven points in a row. Feng Nianhua took advantage of Wang Nanzhen's foul to open the scoring for Donghua. Sun Jingsheng then scored again. After reaching 5 to 12, Donghua's Feng Nianhua became active again and scored repeatedly, suddenly making it 11 to 12, a difference of one point. Jianan then returned to its old state, and Cai Yanxiong, Wang Nanzhen, and others performed very well. The first half ended with a score of 18 to 15, Jianan leading.</p>
<p>Donghua Tied the Score In the second half, Jianan made a concerted effort. Yin Guiren and Cai Yanxiong scored six points, and Chen Xianglong made a long shot, making it 17 to 24. The atmosphere was unusually tense. When the score was 27 to 21, Wang Nanzhen was fouled out of the game. Although Jianan lost a main player, the team still took the lead with a score of 30 to 26 due to the team's efforts. After Yin Guiren was disqualified, the front line became scattered. Donghua's Sun Shiqing and Feng Nianhua scored three points, and Jianan was only one point ahead. Then, Han Zhenyuan made a shot under the basket, and Donghua's Sun Baoqing also followed suit. Lu Zhongen made a free throw, making the score 32 to 32. Jianan then had a free throw opportunity, but the score was canceled because it crossed the line, and the time ended. Overtime was then extended for five minutes to determine the winner.</p>
<p>The Winner was Decided in Overtime Donghua tied the score on the verge of defeat, and their morale was greatly boosted. Feng Nianhua ran to the basket from the right and scored two points, taking the lead. Unfortunately, Bao Chenxianglong's shots were flustered and failed to achieve anything. Instead, Yao Yaoluo scored a goal in a row, still losing by two points.</p>

<h3>The Little Men (1)(2)(7)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>They then began to return home—it was truly a peculiar procession, because Frantz galloped ahead to announce the good news to others: Don and the rabbit led the way; then Leis carried Nan, saying it was "the most precious covering he had ever seen" joking with her all the way. Mr. Bae did not want anyone else to hold Robert; he wanted to do it himself. The little fellow, even more awake after sleeping, stood up in Mr. Bae's arms, talking happily, regarding himself as the protagonist of this decisive event. His mother held him forward, tirelessly listening to him say, "I knew Mama rain would come," or watching him bend down to kiss her, and stuffing a plump blackberry in her mouth, "because she picked them specially to dedicate to her."</p>
<p>By the time they reached the driveway to the gate, the moon was already out, and the children came out to cheer and welcome them. So they held up the two "lost sheep" as if returning from a battle, placing them safely in the dining room, where the two pragmatic little ones only asked for dinner, disregarding affectionate displays. So they were served bread and milk, and the whole family, young and old, stood around watching them. Nan soon regained her spirits, now that the danger had passed, and recounted the various dangers, enjoying every detail. Robert seemed engrossed in his food, but suddenly put down his spoon, making a sound of lament.</p>

The layoff situation gradually deteriorated because the head was too crowded, resulting in a reaction. The trend was that there were only three or five days left in this month, so there must be a huge movement. Yesterday morning, the market opened, and the market atmosphere was still virtual. Number 34 sold out even more, and the unified tax plummeted by 6.5 jiao, which was the smallest of its sales. The remaining such as Numbers 35, 69 and 78 all had sales, and Numbers 21, 43 and 48 were quite buying. The competition on the table was fierce. The secondary market was still dominated by futures trading, and the market price tended to be chaotic, with both high and low prices. It turned out that Number 34 temporarily stopped, and the unified tax and other taxes returned to a high of 3.5 jiao, and the 21 raised salt tax rose to a high of 4.5 jiao, but it still showed weakness after entering. In the afternoon, Number 34 continued to sell, and the layoff sporadic bulls all came out, and Xiao San Si jiao. After entering, Number 54 was slightly needed, and the tail column gradually turned firm. At the close, although Number 34 continued to sell, the number was small. Only the layoff and the 20th customs futures were small and two jiao, and the rest gradually returned due to the purchase of Numbers 4, 43, 48 and 54, etc. The sixth return was 4.5 jiao, and the trend may be slightly higher due to this, but the future is not a good situation after all. As a result, the market price showed mixed fluctuations, but the decline was greater than the rise. The decline was the greatest for the distant-term layoff soldiers, which was 1.25 yuan. The rise was only 2.2 yuan for the 23rd customs. The total number of transactions was 26.01 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York fell under the leadership of silver stocks</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (16th) the New York stock market fell under the leadership of silver stocks, and the trading was very clear. Automobile stocks resisted the most.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Staple Yarn Fell Before Recovering in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then recovered, but ultimately fell by several jiao. The situation of overseas cotton industry became increasingly weak. Some industry players adopted the principle of selling whenever there was a rise. The large amount of funds in the financial community showed a slight outflow. The Jin gang often came out. Recently, the yarn market has been trending downwards. It has fallen by more than ten yuan from the peak. General profit-takers have been actively buying and covering, and the market price has risen together. However, the inventory of yarn has increased compared to before.</p>
<p>The Golden Rooster Still Fell a Few Jiao</p>
<p>In the staple yarn market, the prices for all months opened at a low, and people were panicked due to the sharp drop in American cotton. The selling trend was slightly intense.

Only Hexing and Jinchang were increasing their long positions. As a result, each month fell by 1.4, 6, and 8 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, the price slowly rose because the Osaka Sanpin yarn market initially fell and then recovered. As a result, the price rose and fell by 3 and 5 jiao. Market sentiment turned firm. It was expected that the American cotton market would rise today, and scattered short positions would be covered and return to a high. As a result, the price for each month rose by 6, 8, and 9 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the opening price in the morning. However, the price of _ yarn continued to fall.

<h3>甬帮又来抛賣標花</h3>
<p>The cotton market is sluggish, and the American and Indian cotton markets are consistently trending downwards. People's confidence is further weakened. Current cotton sales are quite clear, factories are stagnant, and export trade is not moving. However, a group of off-market traders are absorbing a certain amount and are firmly unwilling to loosen their grip.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Zheng Biao Futures Market</h3>
<p>The futures market opened with a sharp drop for all months, falling by 5 jiao. American cotton prices fell sharply, with the prices for the last three months breaking through the 1 jiao 1 fen barrier. Indian cotton prices also fell sharply, causing widespread anxiety. Ningbo merchants resumed large-scale selling, but short sellers seized the opportunity to cover their positions. Osaka Sanpin cotton futures rebounded slightly after the fall, and market sentiment stabilized again. As a result, all months fell by an average of 4 jiao 5 fen to 5 jiao 5 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon trading session, market prices gradually rebounded, with most people expecting American cotton prices to rise. However, the Ningbo traders continued to sell, resulting in all months rising by 2 jiao to 3 jiao 5 fen compared to the morning closing price.

<h3>American Spot Cotton Falls 25 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened lower due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Liverpool traders, manufacturers, and Southern merchants all sold, with prices falling by 11 to 14 points for all months. At the same time, long positions continued to be liquidated. Poor transportation, and lack of confidence in the court's rulings, European political situation, and silver prices, selling was not great, limited buying from the trade, slightly stabilised. Spot prices fell by 25 points, and futures prices fell by 18 to 21 points. Current demand is stagnant, and market sentiment remains weak.

<p>Bombay dispatch, 16th. The total amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 4,060 bales, all destined for Kobe.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat See Gradual Buying Interest in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months showed a uniform decline. Quoted prices for foreign wheat: Chicago down about 234 jiao, Canada down 45 jiao. At the opening, quoted prices for foreign wheat continued to fall, and the unstable situation in cotton yarn led long traders to gradually liquidate their positions, causing market sentiment to soften. Near-term and far-term months all fell by 2 to 3 fen, with the current month falling below the 3 yuan level, and forward months falling below the 3 yuan 1 jiao level. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, near-term months remained sluggish, but far-term months rebounded by 1 fen due to short covering. Later, due to a decrease in user demand, short sellers were no longer as eager to cover, and news that factories were also slightly buying back led to a surge in market sentiment, with prices rising by about 5 fen compared to the opening. Currently, market trading is influenced by off-market speculation, and there is no fixed standard for price movements.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, prices for all months were generally sluggish. Due to foreign wheat quotations of 2345 jiao, market sentiment became increasingly quiet. Trading volume for all months was sparse and lifeless, with all months falling by 2 to 3 fen compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the current month remained slightly stable due to a lack of factory demand, but far-term months saw increased buying interest due to the sharp rebound in the flour market, with prices rebounding by 3 to 5 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. However, trading volume remained sparse. If foreign wheat quotations remain loose, the market is not expected to be greatly affected. The current wheat market has stabilized, but high-quality wheat is being hoarded and not offered, and there are few transactions for mid-grade wheat. Shandong wheat opened at 4 yuan 7 jiao 8 fen, Yao 蚌埠 wheat at 4 yuan 7 jiao 6 fen, Wenzhou wheat at 4 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, totaling 500 bags, handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Northern Merchants Actively Procuring Thin Rice</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only over thirty merchants from various sources arrived (totaling over 7,000 shi). Sales in this street remained sluggish. Tianjin, Weihaiwei, Qinhuangdao and other Northern merchants were buying over 3,000 bags. Therefore, the price of high-quality thin rice could still be raised by 7 fen, but middlemen are finding it difficult to make profits. Early japonica rice is also difficult to maintain and has fallen by about 1 jiao. Du Jian (杜尖) rice, due to oversupply, is discounted excessively. Foreign-origin Jian rice (洋尖) is stable due to limited supply. Yin Bian Yuan (陰變元) rice continues to show signs of decline.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, fifty-two or three merchants arrived from various regions along the river. Sales of white japonica rice to rice shops are taking losses. Rice hoarders are buying at low prices. The price edged up by 1 jiao. Early rice is stable. Thin rice continues to move in Tianjin. Retail sales continue to improve. The price is also closely tied to a few fen. Yang Bu Jian (羊埠尖) retail sales are normal. Price is weak. Few orders for Ke Jian (客尖) rice. Market is also weak. Yin Yuan Bian Yuan (陰元變元) sales are stagnant. Price is down by a few fen. Prices of other goods remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Rice Continues to Fall by a Small Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer's Xian rice continued to weaken. Rice from Jiangxi is arriving continuously, and there are also sporadic arrivals from other ports. Rice hoarders have been holding stock for a long time. Business is slow on the street. The arrival of Jiangxi rice has been excessive. The price has fallen by a small jiao. Other types of rice have all fallen by three to five fen. The only sales channel is this street. More than 1,000 bags of Jiangxi rice were sold throughout the day, 200 bags of Anqing rice, 300 bags of Shashi rice, more than 300 bags of Wen Yong rice, 50 bags of Xian Zhou rice, 170 bags of Luo rice, all handled by this street.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Shantou Merchants Moving to Procure Bean Cakes. Soybean Market Sentiment Suddenly Turns Positive</h3>
<p>The soybean market had made little progress due to sluggish sales. The amount of new supply continues to be slow and the base is small (the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has only sixty or seventy train cars). Grain merchants were mostly holding on tightly to their inventory, which lead to upward momentum. Yesterday, when Dalian reported price increase, the markets for soybean cakes in Guangdong, Shantou, and the hinterland suddenly became active (over 71,000 soybean cakes were transacted). Thus, the soybean market presented a good situation. Bengbu beans opened at 4 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen and 5 jiao 2 fen, with two train car's worth being sold. Over 1,200 bags of Luohe beans were sold for 4 yuan 8 jiao 8 fen. Zhada beans, Du beans, and Shahuang beans were also stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Shortage of No. 4 Dongbai Sugar Causes Price to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable. The association's clearing price for No. 2 and No. 4 coarse granulated white sugar was 22 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen for spot and 6 yuan 9 jiao for re-export, with no change. Zhenji No. 1 refined white sugar from this factory was 20 yuan 9 jiao, No. 2 was 6 jiao, No. 3 was 2 jiao, No. 4 was 20 yuan, and No. 5 was 19 yuan 8 jiao. A few dozen packages of new Zhang Diaoqing from Jianbang were offered at 10 yuan 3 jiao, and over a hundred packages of Chen Shilu Qing at 9 yuan 5 jiao. Dongchi and No. 8 and No. 9 Dongbai were all quoted at the original clearing price but did not sell. However, the shortage of No. 4 Dongbai from domestic sources caused the price to rise, with spot at 22 yuan 2 jiao and re-export at 7 yuan 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Inventory of High-Quality Orchid Seeds Sold Out</h3>
<p>Recently, as there have been no new arrivals of orchid seeds for a long time, market inventory is gradually decreasing. However, the price of ordinary goods has fallen compared to before, and although there are sales of high-quality all-yellow goods, they have already sold out. Therefore, if high-quality goods arrive in the next batch, the price is expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Slight Movement in Hand-Picked Zhenmei Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market remained quiet. European and American firms reported that they had already purchased enough goods to meet foreign demand, and with the end of the year approaching, they were unwilling to hoard inventory, causing market sentiment to decline. Yesterday, only Xiehe, Tongfu and other firms conducted some scattered telegraph transactions for Luzhuang hand-picked Zhenmei tea. Other goods such as Xiumei and Gongxi were stagnant. However, the demand for pearl tea was quite strong.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Shipment of No. 5 and No. 6 White Lead Sheets Arrives</h3>
<p>The new shipment of No. 5 and No. 6 white lead sheets, which had been delayed for several days, arrived yesterday, totaling one hundred thirty to one hundred forty barrels, unloaded at Huashun Wharf Warehouse No. 5. Therefore, there is no need to worry about shortages of spot goods in the market going forward. It is said that future shipments will be continuously shipped, and the market may ease. The opening price is 34 yuan per dan, which is 1 yuan cheaper than before. It is said that battery factories and others sold off twenty to thirty barrels yesterday, but as the end of the year approaches, there may be no large transactions this year. Those with goods want to sell them as soon as possible, as the future market may be difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Thousands of Dans of White Lead Wire Offered</h3>
<p>Recently, merchants from Sichuan and Hankou have been actively stocking up on white lead wire, so it is said that two or three thousand dan were offered in the past two days. The market price is not much different from the association's clearing price. It is said that new goods have not yet arrived, so there is less circulating goods on the market, so those holding goods have the intention of raising market prices. However, as the end of the year approaches and money is tight, it is unlikely that price increases will be realized.</p>
<h3>Investigation: Volume of Vegetables and Fruits Entering and Exiting</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the following table shows the vegetables and fruits imported and exported in November that passed the pest and disease inspection by the bureau and were approved for import and export:</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>Each of us in our lives has various yearnings, ideals, and plans. If we could realize them one by one, then the achievements for humanity would be immeasurable. However, we always only have yearnings without immediately seizing them, have ideals without immediately realizing them, have books without immediately implementing them, and ultimately allow all sorts of yearnings, ideals, and plans to vanish and diminish, and reality becomes even more ugly.</p>
<p>Remember that the success of wireless telegraphy was the result of Marconi's dream. Stephenson, while working as a miner, dreamed of inventing the automobile. Recently, the American "China Clipper" plane set a new record of five days for the journey from America to the Far East. We should thank Shakespeare, the poet of dreamers, who told us to see the magic in the mundane and discover the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>
<p>Let us quickly build our most beautiful and beloved dreams. In the current turmoil, we need to realize them one by one.</p>

<h3>Two Types of Old Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Micro-Student</p>
<p>I recently organized an old bookcase, and in a corner of the cabinet, I suddenly found two types of old newspapers from the late Qing Dynasty, a total of fifty or sixty copies, antique and full of flavor, both are single-issue of ten-day periodicals, regretfully incomplete!</p>
<p>One is the "Shi Wu Bao" (Current Affairs Newspaper), founded in June of the 23rd year of Guangxu. The location of the office cannot be found. The content is divided into: essays (Yu Hang Zhang Binglin, Xinhui Liang Qichao often have writings), memorials and edicts, English translations (translator is Xiangxiang Zeng Guangquan), Japanese translations (translator is Japanese Kojo Sadakichi), and others. One foot long and half a foot wide, printed with alum paper and lead, priced at 1 jiao 5 fen per volume, 4 yuan for the whole year of thirty-three volumes, plus 3 volumes for leap years, plus 4 jiao, with distribution points in all provinces.</p>
<p>One is the "Chang Yan Bao" (Free Speech Newspaper), founded in July of the 24th year of Guangxu. The office is located next to the Mud City Bridge on the Great Road in the British Concession. The content is similar to the "Shi Wu Bao", but with an additional French translation (translator is Shanghai Pan Yan). Essayists and translators of English and Japanese are the same as above. Zhang Binglin also occasionally has writings. The price and style are the same.</p>
<h3>One Wen Qian (One Copper Coin)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Guangji</p>
<p>Everyone knows that a "Wen Qian" is a copper coin, but the story of the "Wen Qian" recorded here is not that simple. The so-called "Wen Qian" is the signboard of big stores, and the origin of how it was named "Wen Qian" is said to be like this.</p>
<p>In a certain town, there was a wanderer who, unable to find a job, begged on the street. One day, as he was walking past the wall of a wealthy man's house, he found a copper coin in the pile of ashes swept out by the wealthy family; there were also some red and green scattered pieces of paper. He picked them up one by one, bought a copper coin's worth of paste, tied these red and green pieces of paper into some toys for the children to play with, and called out to buy them at the entrance of the wealthy man's house. The price he charged was only one or two copper coins, because he won the children's favor, and each time there were quite a few patrons. He continued to do this one after another, and also did some other business. In less than a few years, the capital he accumulated was also quite considerable. Later, he opened a top-notch Guang Goods store in that town, and hung a signboard called "One Wen Qian," to remember his origins.</p>
<h3>Entering the Market</h3>
<p>— Tianji</p>
<p>Here, we can know that the success of all things is built up from little by little, day by day, accumulating over time. The so-called "collecting fox furs under the armpits", "gathering sand into a tower", strengthens the belief in the facts above.</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 22: Heroic Words Move Lips, Sisters Gather to Discuss; False Affection Shocks Jade Wrists, Distressed Girl Escapes Prisoner</p>
<p>He said: There is one thing we need to prepare for. That Mr. Jia, it is said, spent over a hundred yuan on this matter. If he wants to return the engagement money before he will let her go, we can't completely refuse. Since we can't refuse, we have to raise the funds. It seems best if everyone donates this sum. As soon as he mentioned donating money, it suppressed everyone's voices. Some ladies were drinking tea from their cups, some were taking out powder mirrors to powder their faces. Some were whispering to the ladies next to them. This silenced the initiator, who stood there without any solution. Mrs. Lan, who was sitting in the chairman's seat, stood up and waved to him, saying: Mrs. Liu, please sit down. As for the matter of this fund, it is very easy to handle, we can all discuss how to plan it. Mrs. Liu, having heard this, covered her face and was not too embarrassed, so she sat down, blushing. Mrs. Lan said: Since we are talking about donations, words are no proof, so I will first use a piece of paper to record it. So she told the waiter to immediately fetch a piece of paper, pen, ink, and inkstone, and took it over herself, picked up the pen and wrote: Mrs. Lan, specialist, donate funds, having written this, she suddenly laid the pen horizontally, shook her head a few times, and smiled; How can I write first by myself? It's better to ask everyone to decide on an amount first, and then I'll make up the remaining amount. As she spoke, she moved the paper and pen to the right, to the side of the first Mrs. Huang. This Mrs. Huang was a plump person, wearing a blue soft satin silk jacket, tightly bound around her fat pig-like body, squeezing the skin in front of her chest, bulging out many layers. Seeing the paper and pen sent in front of her, she immediately dropped the two fleshy bubbles on her face downwards, showing a kind of displeasure. Taking a snow-lotus-like hand with a gold bracelet, she picked up the pen and wrote without adding a word: Anonymous donates 2 jiao of silver. After she finished writing, she moved the paper and pen to the lady next to her. The lady looked at it, nodded twice and smiled: That's right, we don't have to put doing good deeds on our faces, writing anonymous is right. So she followed behind and wrote a line of words, Anonymous donates 1 jiao of silver. The chairman looked at these two people, made a contemplative appearance, and smiled slightly: Although this is left to each person's free will, it's still necessary to get together a sum that looks like a number. If it's written like this, I'm afraid... she pressed her hands on the edge of the table and looked at everyone in the room. (379)</p>
<h3>Things I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Yangzijiang)</p>
<p>It was already 4:30 in the morning, and the daylight before the winter solstice always felt very short. Walking past the Continental Commercial Building on Nanjing Road, the shops on both sides were already brightly lit, as if it were a night market. But a rickshaw puller was complaining in front of the China National Goods Company. Nanjing Road does not allow empty rickshaws to park, and empty rickshaws are not even allowed to pass (except for private rickshaws). The rickshaw puller said: The customer went in half an hour ago and hasn't paid for waiting outside, so when will he wait? It wouldn't be fun if the police came to interfere. …</p>
<p>Just as he was talking to himself (let's say he was complaining to passers-by) and was most anxious, a new female patron walked out of the company. The rickshaw puller turned his head and dragged her away without hesitation. He was already impatient to wait for the fare he was owed from the previous trip.</p>
<p>That well-dressed passenger, even if he didn't intend to cheat, had already done something ungrateful.</p>
<h3>Occasional Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Zhi Shui</p>
<p>Scholars upside down say soulmates, infatuated feelings are deep, I love Ding Gong's tearful words, beauty always belongs to gold. One joy can change a daughter's heart, reality moves people, the world is deep. Hongfu and Qiu Ran are all delusions, frost on temples easily invades the years: Karl's life is full of failures, late in life he accompanies his wife and snow fills his head, the fate of heroes and heroines is predestined, and the childlike heart will never rest until death. Pillowing on spears is only for the sake of being a slave, and labor is still cheap for men, who can understand this meaning? Gold and white bones need each other most!</p>
<h3>Two Poems on Current Events</h3>
<p>— Zhi Shui</p>
<p>Peace and war are full of disputes, hats and crowns can sweep away the dust of fratricide, the turbulent flow is endless, Green Creek water, I want to cast party members with gold, I heard that Hanyang spring is no longer, butterflies are deeply dreaming, no one asks about the enemy cavalry from the east, they only blame the horizontal jade body for being fat.</p>
<h3>Autumn Night Gathering</h3>
<p>— Wei Wenxi</p>
<p>People love to be romantic in their spare time, reciting aloud and singing in the middle of the night, let the yellow leaves grow old with autumn, and borrow the moon to float with the wine cup. For thirty years, I have been a guest on the rivers and seas, and my feelings have been entrusted to seagulls for thousands of years. Fortunately, there is a Hu bed for howling and arrogance, why bother asking about the shifts on the city wall.</p>
<h3>Small Anecdotes of Wooden Fish</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The wooden fish mentioned here is not the thing in the Buddhist hall that monks tap while chanting sutras, but the wooden fish slice that used to be very popular in Jianghuai, where guests could look but not eat.</p>
<p>In Xing (hua), Dong (tai) and other counties, generally, when families have weddings, funerals, or celebrations, they entertain guests in twenty or thirty tables to sixty or seventy tables. After the dishes are served, fish are served at the end of the banquet. The pronunciation of fish sounds like "abundance", so guests wish the host "good fortune and abundance", so most leave the fish uneaten. Over time, although hosts buy a large number of fish, they prepare but do not eat them, wasting money, which is extremely uneconomical. However, respecting the etiquette of hospitality, the item of fish must be purchased and prepared.</p>
<p>Since this matter was passed down, cunning people, to save money, carved fish shapes from wooden slices, painted with gills and eyes, and adjusted with soy sauce color, no different from real fish. Serving guests with wooden fish became a common practice more than ten years ago. This trend has recently diminished slightly. Two or three bowls of real steamed fish are served, showing it slightly on dozens of tables, which is enough to serve guests without offending them.</p>
<p>During the era when wooden fish were popular, I often remembered a farmer going to a city banquet. When the fish was served, the farmer did not know the etiquette, so he picked up chopsticks and flipped it, but it was hard and could not move. At that time, he was extremely horrified. The guests jokingly said to him: The fish in the city is not as crisp as the fish in the countryside, let's save it for next time! The farmer still did not understand, and stared blankly at the fish. The guests all laughed, left their seats and dispersed, and the farmer left in confusion. Later, someone ridiculed people who were afraid of hardness but not afraid of softness: Country people eat fish, soft ones go into the stomach, hard ones dare not use chopsticks. A wooden monk hits a wooden bell, the wooden energy is too heavy. Although the trend of serving guests with wooden fish has disappeared, everyone still giggles when talking about this matter!</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3>Rural Flavor</h3>
<p>— Zhu Kui</p>
<p>Now that the field work is done and the new grains are on the market, the farmers, who have been busy for a year, can finally enjoy the pleasures of the countryside. At this time, farmers can naturally enjoy some delicacies. The new rice is glutinous, and the vegetables and grains are sweet. Enjoying the sun and living in peace is no different from the legendary Emperor Xi. The following are some winter snacks from farmhouses, and their rural flavors are indeed unique.</p>
<p>Cabbage　The green and purple cabbage in the fields, after being soaked in heavy frost, becomes even sweeter and more glutinous. At this time, when the new grains are on the market, cooking cabbage porridge and cabbage rice is so fragrant that it opens up the appetite and increases food intake. Cooking the cabbage heart in soup, grinding new rice into powder, and making small, flat, round dumplings to cook in the soup is called "cabbage heart flat-mouth dumplings" by the people of Suzhou. The fragrance of cabbage and the glutinousness of the powder make it taste a hundred times better than famous and expensive pastries. Green vegetable noodles with lard are also uniquely delicious, and both snacks are very filling, cheap, and beautiful, making them economical everyday foods for families.</p>
<p>Pumpkin　Pumpkins are very easy to propagate. They can thrive and grow no matter where they are planted. In homes, they are planted in rice baskets filled with ashes, and the vines can climb onto the roof and bear huge pumpkins. Pumpkins taste sweet and are also very filling. Poor families in the countryside cook large chunks of pumpkin in a pot, which can replace rice and grains. People in Suzhou are more particular about eating pumpkins. They peel the pumpkins, cut them into small, thin slices, heat oil in a pot, add water, and cook the pumpkins until they are mushy, forming a thin paste. Then, they add flat-mouth dumplings made of glutinous rice flour and cook them together, or mix flour into a paste, spoon it into the pot one spoonful at a time while cooking and stirring. The flour forms small pieces of dough. Although the shapes of these pumpkin flat-mouth dumplings and pumpkin dough pieces are not elegant, they are excellent in terms of color, aroma, and taste. Rural flavors are originally delicious but not visually appealing.</p>
<p>Radish　Winter radishes are adorably plump, and their taste is as tender as water pears. During the winter season around the stove, people's throats are prone to swelling and inflammation, but eating raw radishes can relieve these symptoms. Their effect is even more effective than medicine. In addition to eating raw radishes, cooking them into rice dishes is also suitable for both braised pigeons and vegetarian dishes. There are two kinds of radish pastries: shredded radish pancakes and shredded radish dumplings. Grating radishes into shreds on the bamboo strips of a rice basket, wrapping them in dough to make pancakes, and deep-frying them in oil is very delicious. This kind of pancake is called "straight pancake" by the people of Suzhou because the dough is filling, while the radish can aid digestion. The combination of flour and radish precisely balances each other out. However, using radish shreds as filling to make dumplings is not called "straight dumplings." Around the Winter Solstice festival, families in Suzhou make radish dumplings to offer to their ancestors. The dumplings can be either savory or vegetarian, and they are all very delicious.</p>
<p>Eggs　Pigsties and chicken coops are essential decorations in rural villages. Chickens are raised by almost every family in the countryside, so every family has eggs. In the countryside, where transportation is inconvenient, the standard snack for honored guests is poached eggs. Boiling water, breaking the eggs and dropping them into the soup, waiting for them to coagulate and cook, adding a little salt, and then serving them in a bowl for the guest. Poached eggs in Suzhou families are naturally more refined. The soup is made with lard and good soy sauce, and sometimes vermicelli is added, making the taste naturally better.</p>

<h3>The Death Knell of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>Soviet newspapers recently criticized the so-called reconciliation plan of Britain and France regarding the Italian-Abyssinian War. This plan sacrifices the weak as the price to alleviate the contradiction between the British and Italian empires in the Mediterranean, calling it "the death knell of the League of Nations." The death knell of the League of Nations had already been rung long ago. As early as the "September 18th Incident" when Japan invaded northeastern China, followed by Germany's withdrawal and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the League of Nations had already declared its death. And recently, the so-called reconciliation plan of Britain and France regarding the Italian-Abyssinian War, the content of which is that Britain and France make concessions to Italy as much as possible on their interests in East Africa, ceding some important land and economic benefits of Abyssinia to Italy, in order to satisfy the desires of Italian imperialism and make Italy end the war in East Africa as soon as possible, in order to alleviate the new contradictions that have recently occurred between British and Italian imperialism in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>All the contradictions, conflicts, and compromises of imperialism in the colonies, no matter how "innovative" or different in form, have one consistent sinful purpose: under what compromise conditions to jointly divide the colonies. The recent establishment of the so-called reconciliation plan of Britain and France regarding the Italian-Abyssinian War precisely illustrates that this fact is absolutely true!</p>
<p>Now that the so-called reconciliation plan of Britain and France regarding the Italian-Abyssinian War has been established, the future work of the League of Nations will no longer be to use any method to prevent Italian imperialism from invading East Africa, but to use what proper method to divide Abyssinia and suppress the anti-imperialist war of the Abyssinian people under the spoils-sharing conference of the three major imperialist powers of Britain, France, and Italy. However, are the Abyssinian people, who are united in resisting Italy and opposing imperialism, willing to sacrifice the interests of the entire nation and succumb to the spoils-sharing conference of imperialism? According to telegrams, the Abyssinian king has stated that Abyssinia cannot accept any reconciliation plan that divides Abyssinia; Abyssinia is determined to resist to the end and oppose any facts that are detrimental to Abyssinia. How excited and ashamed are the masses, who have suffered all kinds of oppression and insults and do not even have the right to breathe, when they hear this! This emperor is worthy of the support of all the Abyssinian people and the sympathy and support of the oppressed people all over the world!</p>
<h3>Rural Education</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>There was a time when I helped my friend teach in a remote township. The school was a dilapidated temple, and the main hall was the classroom. As for the students? During the busy farming season, not a single one might come to school. At first, we went door-to-door to persuade them, explaining to their parents the importance of reading and writing in the simplest terms. But their answers completely suppressed our courage. They were all kind people. They considered it an honor for the "teacher" to visit their homes, and at the same time, they feared that their children might commit mistakes at school. They treated us exactly like they treated the bailiffs who collected rent. After we explained our intentions, their faces became troubled, as if a model was speaking. We learned their hardships from each parent. They said that farming was no longer a good profession. Fertilizer was expensive, labor was expensive, but the rice they grew was worthless, and droughts occurred every two or three years. But what else could they do besides farming? Every year, they hoped for a good harvest so that everyone could drink a thin gruel. Reading—we knew that they suffered from not knowing how to read. It was truly a blessing that the township head wanted to set up a school in the town, and it didn't cost us a penny. Why wouldn't we want our children to read? Knowing a few more words might allow them to find another profession in the future. But two children could be worth one day's labor. Hiring short-term workers required wages, and they had to be treated with good food and drink. Where would we get the money? If only we could guarantee a good harvest... And the final conclusion was: "Please forgive us, teachers. After the busy farming season, we will immediately send our children to school."</p>
<p>My friend was an educator. He gave up a good profession to serve as the principal in that township. He wrote me a very long letter, saying that his grand ambition had now been realized. To popularize education, we should start in such poor and remote places. Now, someone was providing a little meager funding. As long as we were willing to work hard, we might achieve unexpected results. He also asked me to help complete this great and virtuous undertaking. I was idle at home at the time, so I agreed to his request and mustered the courage to take on this arduous task. When the township head welcomed us, the entire town was standing in the large square, fathers smiling, children jumping. My friend even stood on a mound to give a loud speech, which earned applause from the townspeople. At dinner at the township head's house that day, he said that he was very happy that the townspeople knew the importance of literacy. He wanted to not be afraid of hardship, unite with comrades, and work hard. But as soon as school started, it was the busy farming season, and students were disappearing one by one. After running around and persuading people for a day, he realized that empty rhetoric was exposed for what it was in the face of the iron wall of reality. He knew the prerequisite for popularizing education. But he was not discouraged. He said that as long as the children came to school for one day, we should do our best for that one day. At least that spirit would not be wasted.</p>
<p>A semester ended without any achievements to speak of because they studied for one day and took three days off. Although the children liked to read, work was more pressing than reading, and their attention shifted from books to work. After the summer vacation, when school should have started, it should have been the freest season in the countryside. However, on the day we announced the news of the school opening, we brought back an even more painful stimulus. The children's parents asked us to postpone the start of school for a few days, saying that now that everyone was free, a family of several people would have no food to eat if they didn't find some other work to do. So the children picked up vegetable baskets and went to the streets, or went to the woods to pick up firewood. In the evening, the children secretly came to school to read a few words under the kerosene lamp, but they were called home by their parents, who wanted to use this time to weave bamboo baskets, make straw ropes, and hammer tin ingots.</p>
<p>The second semester ended, and the principal felt deeply disappointed. He went to the township head's house to resign. On a snowy morning, we followed the porters and left the small town. A group of children in thin, ragged clothes saw us off to the pier. They asked when the teacher would come next year. My friend vaguely answered them, and we quietly left like fugitives. — That was four or five years ago.</p>
<h3>Grain Collector</h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>Two or three small pot-bellied men carrying rifles followed a rather refined figure wearing a felt hat and a Zhongshan suit, with two shiny badges dangling on his collar. When that group swaggered into this township, many farm families who necessarily had to deal with this group broke out in a cold sweat, as if a great disaster was about to befall them. They were flustered and didn't know how to cope.</p>
<p>"What should we do?" Everyone looked at each other in dismay.</p>
<p>The eldest was calm, his experience knowing how to deal with this difficult situation. That is to say, he had to prepare everything that could not be avoided before they came to the door. So, when that group swarmed into the eldest's house,</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you've worked hard, coming all the way from the county seat, please sit down, please sit down."</p>
<p>The eldest had already greeted them, saying with a stuttering smile, bowing as he did so.</p>
<p>The one in the Zhongshan suit took off his hat, and the eldest hurried forward to take it. Then he took out a cigarette from a cigarette case, put it in his mouth, and the eldest hurriedly struck a match to light it. The eldest's daughter was busy making tea, pouring it into several large bowls and handing them to everyone. The soldiers put their rifles down by their feet, opened their mouths, and gulped down the tea water in large mouthfuls.</p>
<p>The one in the Zhongshan suit stared greedily at the daughter's face, smiling slightly. The soldiers' hawk-like eyes swept back and forth, finally landing on the stove filled with wine and dishes.</p>
<p>"Old man, I don't need to tell you, you should be sensible. Your grain tax has been overdue for two seasons. This time, no matter what, you have to hand it over."</p>
<p>The one in the Zhongshan suit said coldly, but his face was not facing the eldest, his gaze still shooting towards the eldest's daughter's face and chest, his eyes filled with the light of despicable desire.</p>
<p>The eldest said in a respectful tone: "Yes, yes, sir, please do a good deed. It's really not that I deliberately delayed it, how dare I do that, but the year is not good. Give me some time, and I will personally send it to your office, sir..."</p>
<p>The eldest's words were not finished when the man became furious, rushing up and scolding:</p>
<p>"Old turtle, don't talk nonsense, who wants to listen to your crap, in a word, hand over the money quickly, or else we'll arrest someone?"</p>
<p>But the eldest bowed respectfully and said: "Sir, please have something to eat first?"</p>
<p>At the same time, he told the girl to move the chicken, fish, and meat from the earthen stove, as well as the wine, to a square table, and invited the distinguished guests to take a seat. The eldest himself went back and forth diligently to pour wine for them, urging everyone to drink as much as possible. The one in the Zhongshan suit stared even more fiercely at his daughter with eyes full of red threads, as if he wanted to devour her, and joked with a smile:</p>
<p>"Hey, old man, you are really lucky to have raised such a beautiful girl, why worry about not having a way out, you fool..."</p>
<p>Then a mouthful of wine-smelling spittle landed directly on the eldest's face. The eldest echoed with a bitter smile. On one side, he saw that the men were a little tipsy, so he took the opportunity to quietly walk up to the one in the Zhongshan suit, took out a few shiny silver coins from his pocket and stuffed them into his palm, and then said to the soldiers:</p>
<p>"Sirs, this is some travel expenses, please accept them!"</p>
<p>They all smiled contentedly.</p>
<h3>Elegy</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Young people should have the bright emotions of the autumn sky, the light and agile posture of a swallow, and the joyful laughter that completely forgets sorrow. Yes! Young people are the darlings of happiness, and their pure and innocent hearts, untouched by the muddy currents of the world, are most worthy of love and protection. But I, pitifully and for no reason bearing a young body, have long lost everything that young people possess. A heart, soaked in the dark and filthy atmosphere, filled with the desolate taste of the human world, has become a troubled existence, listlessly and sighing, lost in the gloomy days shrouded in mist, without joy, without happiness, only silently drinking the endless bitter wine of life. Life is like a fierce and merciless judge, not allowing me to walk freely even a step, letting it manipulate me. I silently lowered my head and felt at peace, because I knew that fate had already arranged an eternal tragedy. Although youth may be as beautiful as a spring flower, my youth is like a tree planted in the dark shadow where the sunlight never shines, withering silently without ever blooming. So I quietly listened to the subtle sound of the setting sun of youth ringing past from the bottom of my heart. I felt nothing, because I understood that I was an unfortunate person who had long been rejected by happiness. What else did I hope for? Even if there were some illusions, they were as vague as writing on water. For the days that are only filled with sorrow and grief and lack joy, an endless weariness has already arisen.</p>

<p>I saw an article about Wang Manjie and Xi Yuqun in "Zhou Bo" that slightly deviated from the facts. I, therefore, correct the following for Wang and Xi: Upon investigation, Wang and Xi's acquaintance was not due to Xi recommending advertisements to Man's company. It's a long story. Since Wang Manjie and Han collaborated on the "Kiss Exorcism Film" and gained the honor of "Three Great Singers," she had to socialize with Han. One month, during the windy month of June, they innocently strolled through Waitanyuan Park and unintentionally encountered Xi Yuqun, who was a good friend of Han. Since they had met, even if she didn't want to introduce them, she had to. That was the moment Wang and Xi met. Afterwards, relying on Xi's "Western suit and casual demeanor" and the "gimmicks" of tabloid advertisement brokers, he became the apparent boss of Man's company. At that time, many people called Xi Yuqun "Boss Xi." Later, Boss Xi had ulterior motives and shifted his target to Man Ying, a member of the company, leading to jealousy and the downfall of Man's company. Now, Man Ying has a new love, and Boss Xi, reminiscing about the past, feels that Wang is still better, so he goes to the Orient or Lily every day to look for Singer Wang, the boss. A certain newspaper once said that writing news requires solid evidence, so I am telling readers the accurate information.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>On "Peach Blossom Dream"</h3>
<p>"Peach Blossom Dream" is a domestic song and dance film produced by Shanghai Company.</p>
<p>In the current difficult environment of the Chinese film industry, producing song and dance films is honestly a thankless task. In terms of the production process, song and dance films are the most burdensome to produce, requiring sufficient and excellent resources and manpower; in terms of the educational value of films, song and dance films are often considered a kind of "frivolous joy." However, the fact that song and dance films are popular with audiences is undeniable. Moreover, if we don't hold onto a stubborn prejudice, then using the form of song and dance films to express appropriate content (such as depicting the extravagance of urban society, exposing the decadent lives of the leisure class, and the madness and decline of people at the end of the century) also has its unique advantages. To allow domestic films to develop in a more diverse way, why not let them "take a chance"?</p>
<p>However, Du Yu likes to produce song and dance films. This "Peach Blossom Dream" is his latest and more satisfactory contribution.</p>
<p>The theme of "Peach Blossom Dream" is to depict the modern woman's craze for money. It depicts how a group of wandering girls on the streets sell their youth and beauty to win the favor of the wealthy; on the one hand, it tries to emphasize the magic of money. For example, the scene of dancing in the ballroom, with huge silver coins dancing, is an excellent satirical technique. Because the screenwriter used "dream" as a symbol, the depiction is exaggerated, and some parts are almost absurd, but in terms of effect, it has reached a very high level.</p>
<p>The girls are played by Yin Mingzhu, Ying Yin, Cang Yinqiu, and Lei Mengna. Yin Mingzhu's beauty, Ying Yin's health, Cang Yinqiu's silliness, and Lei Mengna's allure are all very fitting. Li Amao's portrayal of the clown's tragedy can be said to be extremely thought-provoking.</p>
<p>The dance scenes are filmed very well. The scene of washing clothes in Peach Blossom Creek, with dozens of beautiful girls singing and dancing, truly gives the impression of a heavenly realm. As for the beauty of the photography and visuals, Du Yu is originally very famous, so there is no need to say more.</p>
<h3>The Dam Opening Scene in "Triumphant Song"</h3>
<p>A dike about ten feet long and sixty feet high, with the rolling river, the turbulent Yangtze River, on one side. Fishing boats dotted the river, and huge sailboats traveled east and west. On the other side was an endless expanse of fields, the crops in the fields all withered and yellow.</p>
<p>This is a major scene in the sound film "Triumphant Song" produced by Yihua Company and directed by Bu Wancang—the dam opening scene. It also used hundreds of employees and took many days to build, covering an area of more than eight acres.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is the most important scene in "Triumphant Song," with many scenes and many people. There are always about seven or eight hundred men and women, young and old, every day, and filming has been going on for eight days. Especially because of the plot, these many actors have to be barefoot and need to sweat, but the weather is so cold that even wearing cotton-padded clothes feels thin. Not to mention sweating, just baring their shoulders will freeze them. Later, Bu Wancang came up with a solution, which was to have everyone lift iron hoes and dig the soil non-stop, so that they would naturally take off their clothes piece by piece, and only when their clothes were completely off would they officially enter the frame. Therefore, in recent days, the entire Yihua studio has only seen thousands of heads moving and thousands of iron hoes flashing up and down, making clanging sounds. The scene and atmosphere are indeed very spectacular and tense. At the same time, it is precisely because of this that the results obtained are unexpectedly satisfactory and powerful.</p>
<p>It can be said that the scenes in "Triumphant Song" are all majestic, tense, great, and powerful. Especially this dam opening scene is even more magnificent. However, we must understand that "Triumphant Song" has achieved this result because most artists have struggled through hardship with a firm and unyielding spirit and perseverance before succeeding.</p>
<h3>"Flower of Spring" About to Bloom</h3>
<p>Spring is the season most worthy of people's remembrance. Beautiful flowers symbolize the rose-colored youth of life. "Flower of Spring," what a moving name this should be!</p>
<p>Director Wu Cun's past works were subtle and profound, which had already left a good impression in the audience's minds. He has been silent for a long time, hasn't he? You miss this artist.</p>
<p>Now, his new work "Flower of Spring" has already begun active filming. The story has lively dance halls, complicated urban residences, exposure of human deception, true mutual assistance and sympathy... Depicting the powdered lives of northern singers, the battlefield romances of veterans, intertwined into a moving and admirable story. Human joys and sorrows, the fall of singers, are unfolded in scene after scene, and with the efforts of the director and actors, when this spring flower blooms, it is expected to captivate for a time.</p>
<h3>"Art Sound" Year-End Issue Published Today</h3>
<p>"Art Sound" is unanimously praised as the most noble and richest among current film publications. The sixth year-end issue has been published today, making a year-end summary of the major and minor events of the Chinese film scene and the various aspects of Hollywood, writing in a humorous and relaxed tone everywhere.

The success or failure of each car manufacturer's new cars for the coming year can determine the success or failure of its business in the coming year. Therefore, each car manufacturer must undergo a detailed plan and careful consideration before manufacturing new cars, and dare not be careless. Time passes quickly. In the blink of an eye. 1935 is about to completely fade away. Therefore. British and American car manufacturers are busy planning the manufacture of new cars again. Moreover, some car manufacturers' 1936 model new cars have already been launched. Although these new cars have not been shipped to China. However, we have indeed read a lot of news about British and American car manufacturers determining to manufacture 1936 model new cars.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the Detroit automobile base camp in the United States. Every year, when new cars from various car manufacturers are about to be launched, those car parts manufacturers must first compete with each other to manufacture parts suitable for the new cars. Therefore, now, those manufacturers are busy manufacturing machines and parts for use in 1936 model new cars. Especially the parts manufacturers. The busyness of work is far greater than in previous years. After autumn. In Detroit. Some car manufacturers have already stopped manufacturing 1935 model new cars. Started planning 1936 model new cars. However, some are continuing to manufacture 1935 model new cars. To supply the sales for the last quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Before the new car season is about to arrive. In Detroit, this automobile city. Rumors are constantly spreading again. Some people say that mid-priced and low-priced cars. The new cars for next year. In terms of structure. There will not be much reform. But on the other hand. Someone said that in the midst of the recovery movement in the automobile industry. In fact, there have been no major innovations in recent years. Now the crisis in the automobile industry has passed. The market has improved again. Therefore, next year, general car manufacturers. Prepare to spend more money. A big reform. These two rumors. On the surface, they seem a bit contradictory. But if we think about it carefully. It can also be said that they are both correct. Some car manufacturers. 1935 model new cars have already undergone major reforms. Then the 1936 model will naturally not have major reforms again. On the opposite side. Some car manufacturers. This year's new cars did not have much reform. Next year's new cars. Naturally, there will be a big reform. This can be regarded as a formula in the automobile industry. Every year is like this.</p>
<p>Not long ago. New York held an automobile exhibition. In this automobile exhibition. American car manufacturers. All have products to participate. Although there are not many new cars. But we can also find a few. Regarding the manufacturing aspect. 1936 model new cars. The general trend is towards appearance and economy. In terms of form and paintwork. Strive for beauty. And the structure of the machine parts. Then try to make its oil consumption economical. Increase the mileage. All the equipment. Are very luxurious. The car body is made of pure steel. The bearings are made of solid metal. Because of the sales of American car manufacturers this year. In addition to low-priced cars. Mid-priced cars have also made considerable progress. Therefore, next year, each factory will also prepare to do its best to reform the mid-priced new cars. In order to promote sales.</p>
<p>As for British car manufacturers. As for how to design the 1936 model new cars. The information we have received. Although less than the American side. But there is one important improvement. At least it can be introduced to readers. That is the ventilation problem. The ventilation on the car. Although there have been many improvements in recent years. But we are sitting in any car. If you keep the car windows all closed. You will always feel a kind of suffocating and stuffy smell. Moreover, to go further. This smell. It can even affect the health of people in the car. Therefore, the British automobile industry. Recently, I have been very committed to improving the ventilation problem. Make the inside of the car. Not only can the air be sufficient. And it's cleaner. Equipped with a special air purifier. In other words. They hope that the air inside the car. Can be warm in winter and cool in summer. Always sufficient. Clean all year round. Make every car owner feel the good ventilation. And sitting inside. Especially feel comfortable.</p>

<h3>The New Vauxhall of 1936</h3>
<h3>Current Situation of the American Automobile Manufacturing Industry</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Macauley's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Alvan Macauley, President of Packard Motor Car Company of America and Chairman of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, delivered a radio broadcast in New York earlier this month. He spoke in detail about the current situation of the American automobile manufacturing industry. He also said that the American automobile industry in 1936 will recover and prosper. Judging from the current situation, it will go smoothly and without any obstacles. Macauley's speech described in detail the advantages of the American automobile industry last year. And the issue of road safety. He also expressed his views without reservation. He believes that a law should be adopted to restrain negligent drivers and pedestrians. And said that most Americans are sometimes car drivers. And sometimes they are pedestrians. If he is punished when he is a driver. And when he is a pedestrian, he is lenient. Is there anything more unfair than this?</p>
<p>Part of Macauley's speech is as follows. Those who want to buy a car in 1936 are very lucky. No matter what price they buy, they will definitely choose an outstanding car. The highest value of goods that car buyers can exchange for money. Except for now. There has never been one before. The continuous improvement in automobile manufacturing. And the unbelievably low price. The ability to manufacture such excellent cars. It has made the automobile industry and its related industries rank at the forefront of the recovery and prosperity process. Since the automobile industry has become an important industry in the world, in the season when all industries are declining, it has been able to rank first in all industries with its own luck. In 1935, it was able to reach a new peak. Since the full record in 1929. This year's output is the largest. The number of cars and trucks manufactured this year will reach 3,000,000. Even with this number. Compared with 1934, it is 28% higher.</p>
<p>The activities of the automobile industry. For workers who have lost their jobs, the resumption of work. Quite a few have also been resolved in the United States. Almost all states in the country have their contributions to automobile manufacturing. Directly or indirectly. The automobile industry has enabled 5,056,000 people to obtain work. In many automobile and parts manufacturing plants. I would like to briefly describe the relationship between employers and employees, managers and laborers. The only hope of investment. It is to obtain a surplus through various efforts. The hope of the workers is to improve their working conditions. Especially pay attention to the level of remuneration. All of this is based on the common desires of mankind. And its intention is very good. What else can we ask for that can make us progress and happy? The labor problems in the automobile industry. Generally speaking, they are very pleasant. Because both sides can show mutual consideration. And they can also pay attention to human rights and justice. The working conditions in the automobile manufacturing industry. There is significant improvement. The principle of integrity and benefit. It has established its solid foundation. Because we manufacturers have no intention of abandoning it. This has to be said to be a major progress in society. Because of the result of mutual understanding between people. The satisfaction of workers' working conditions. It is unprecedented. The high wages have set a new record in the history of various industries. Even higher than in 1929. I don't mean that we have reached the highest ideal state. But significant progress has been achieved. We look forward to the future. It seems that the history of the future of 1936 will develop. And there are no obstacles in the middle. Once everything is launched. Various forces gather together. The recovery of prosperity. It is a fact. Its principle is the same.</p>
<p>The progress of the American automobile industry last year. Its obvious state has been recognized by the public. It has also greatly helped the recovery of national prosperity. But people in the automobile industry. Not satisfied with this. We are still studying some issues. To carry out progress with the greatest effort. One of the most important issues. That is the safety of streets and highways. For many years. Automobile manufacturers and hundreds of public and private organizations in the country. All are concerned about solving the problem of traffic accidents. The only point that manufacturers pay attention to. It is to make the car itself. Let its safety be combined with manufacturing. Therefore, in terms of the car itself. For new cars and carefully handled cars. The occurrence of danger. Almost nothing can be seen. It can be said to be impeccable. The Automobile Manufacturers Association also cooperates with legislative and educational authorities. In order to effectively manage this situation. There is another thing that cannot be ignored here. That is, a year ago, this association and Harvard University's Street Traffic Research Center cooperated with each other. This method can be called the most complete work to solve traffic problems. The purpose of this work. The Automobile Manufacturers Association plans to contribute the research results to the government agencies and public organizations of various states. To know the safest and most effective methods to prevent accidents. Equal emphasis on theory and experience.</p>
<p>To solve the entire traffic problem in one way. This goal has not yet been achieved. However, known remedies. If applied properly. And make efforts to implement. Its effectiveness is also very good. But the most important thing. It is still a human problem. That is the driver and the pedestrian. Today, many cities in the country. All are buildings that are hundreds or hundreds of years old. Narrow streets. Not suitable for modern traffic. It needs to be completely transformed. Only wait for another day. Some cities are already in the process of reconstruction. But most cities are still waiting to proceed. There are also many other aspects that are being carried out at the same time. Especially the cars we use today. Its safety design. It can be said that we have done everything that human beings can do. The only thing that needs to be paid attention to is. That is, all careless drivers. Cannot shirk their blame. However, pedestrians should also be subject to practical restraints. And this kind of restraint is for the benefit of protecting themselves. Because you want to fight steel with flesh and blood. Everyone knows it is difficult. American car drivers. Sometimes they are pedestrians. There should be no hostile actions between the two. Only punish him for his negligence when driving. And when he is a pedestrian, he is lenient. This does not seem to be a fair way.</p>
<h3>Important Winter Driving Tips</h3>
<p>— By Fang Jinlu</p>
<p>With the arrival of winter, most car owners generally think that adding some alcohol or other antifreeze to the radiator and covering the radiator with a radiator cover is all that's needed. Little do they know that winter car care involves more than just these two things. There are other, more important aspects to consider. Now, I will briefly list some of the more important points for your reference.</p>
<p>When starting the engine by engaging the starter motor, also depress the clutch (commonly known as the "clutch"). This allows the gears in the gearbox to disengage from the engine, preventing them from turning. At the same time, the engine itself reduces its load, making it easier to turn over. This saves the battery's power output, and makes starting the engine easier.</p>
<p>If the engine does not start immediately, do not pull out the choke (commonly known as the "choke"). If the engine turns a few times but still does not start, release the starter motor switch and pause for a moment to allow the gasoline already drawn into the cylinders to evaporate slightly, and then try starting the motor again.</p>
<p>Do not "idle" the engine to warm it up. "Idling" the engine is bad in any situation, especially when the engine is cold.</p>
<p>To warm up the engine, it is best to let the engine run at a low speed and gradually accelerate, but not too quickly.</p>
<p>Unless the car is already equipped with a radiator cover or a thermostat, it is best to cover the front of the radiator with something that can be rolled up, such as a thick cloth, when starting the engine. This will make it easier for the engine to warm up. If using a radiator cover, the lower half of the radiator should be covered and the upper half should be exposed. The lower part of the radiator contains cold water, especially in radiators using thermosiphon cooling systems. Often, the water in the upper part is already warm, while the water in the lower part is still in danger of freezing.</p>
<p>Placing a few pieces of cardboard inside the hood to cover the ventilation holes can make the occupants of the car feel very warm, while also improving engine performance.</p>
<p>Check the generator's charging rate. It is best to slightly increase the charging rate in winter, as the amount of electricity supplied by the battery is often greater than in summer.</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>After adding antifreeze to the radiator or distilled water to the battery, run the engine for a dozen minutes. This allows the antifreeze and water in the cooling system, or the distilled water and sulfuric acid in the battery, to mix properly and prevent freezing.</p>
<p>If the engine overheats and the water in the radiator boils, be especially careful when removing the radiator cap. If boiling water gushes out of the filler neck, it can damage the car's paint and leave marks.</p>
<p>Change the lubricating oil more frequently than in summer. Most cars require lighter oil in winter, but always follow the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
<p>Regarding the carburetor mixture, it is best to consult with the dealer where you purchased your car and have them adjust it for you. Carburetor fuel in winter needs to be adjusted to be slightly richer. The author believes that it is best not to try this yourself. If the mixture is adjusted to be too rich, it will cause excessive gasoline consumption. If it is too lean or not rich enough, it will make the engine work weakly. Therefore, adjusting the mixture to the proper richness requires expertise.</p>
<p>Whenever the engine overheats, do not suddenly add cold water to the radiator. If you do, the cylinder head or cylinder water jacket may suddenly encounter cold water, causing it to crack. The correct way is to let the engine cool down slowly until you can touch the cylinder head without burning yourself. Then add water. If it is an engine with a water pump that has overheated and there is still water left in the radiator, let the engine cool down slowly and then start the engine, running it very slowly. Then slowly add water to the radiator. At this time, because the engine is running, the water pump will pump the water, causing it to flow and circulate continuously, and the engine will not be damaged.</p>
<p>For engines using alcohol as antifreeze, if steam is seen coming out of the overflow pipe in the radiator, stop the engine immediately. This steam is very harmful. It can cause the water in the radiator to gradually escape through the overflow pipe until the radiator is empty. This can damage the cylinders, burn the pistons, and cause other engine overheating problems that are difficult to repair. This is extremely important and requires special attention.</p>
