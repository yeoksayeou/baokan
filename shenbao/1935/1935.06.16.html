<p>— 昂</p>
<p>自一九二七年史太林放棄宣傳世界革命之政策。蘇聯全國師埋頭於經濟建設。此固蘇聯國運之一大轉機。亦國際政局之一大關鍵。蓋蘇聯今日在歐在亞。莫不處於舉足重輕之地位。已彰彰在人耳目。遠東方面之局勢。暫置不論。歐洲方面。則英掌璽大臣艾登及法外長賴伐爾旣先後訪莫斯科。捷克外長皮宜士近復突成其遊俄使命。而羅馬尼亞亦正隨法捷之後。與之商訂互援條約。此近今歐洲國際關係上莫斯科與日內瓦並重之表徵。亦集體和平運動史上之重要階段也。</p>
<p>集體和平制為歐戰後產生之新國際主義。各國對此之作用。自不能一概而論。然其理想固欲別於戰前對峙之軍事同盟也。據艾登言。「集體和平制者。卽其完成之日。各以共同之力使各獲安寗」之謂。故此種國際關係上之新精神。如能為各國所奉行。則與戰前之德奧意三國同盟與英法俄三國協約之相傾相軋。自不可同日而語。</p>
<p>集體和平制就現狀言。當以國聯為本。惟列強對於國聯各有懷抱。卽以英法而論。兩國之外交政策。均以國聯為基礎。然亦同牀各夢。如英視國聯為各國協商以謀合作之和平機關。終其極不過為造成世界輿論之中心。法人心目中則欲使國聯成為維持現狀之有力組織。自國聯成立以列。英國主張頗佔優勢。故集體保安運動亦為英國及其屬地之勢力所左右。如國聯盟約第十條第十六條之加新解釋。一九二二年互援草約及一九二四年日內瓦議定書之功敗垂成。莫不由此。降至晚近。國際形勢日非。集體和平制之急宜充實。英法已有同感。於是法得英之贊助。而有締結東歐公約之議。</p>
<p>今日計劃中之東歐公約。原擬合一九二六年之洛卡諾公約。而成歐洲集體和平制之兩大柱石。已經成立之法俄捷俄兩約。以及卽將訂立之羅俄一約。不過為全部東歐公約中之片段。惟吾人如將一九二六年之洛卡諾條約與法俄捷俄兩約作一比較。則後老實較前者為進步。為有力。蓋西歐洛卡諾為當時普遍保安運動失敗後不得已而思其次之妥恊辦法。其骨幹不過為法德比英意五國共同保障萊茵河左岸五十基羅米達之非武裝地帶一點。仍不脫英國傳統政策之輪廓也。此約在當時所以深受各國之謳歌而認為一大進步者。無非以此約為使戰勝國與戰敗國處於平等地位共同保障之嚆矢而已。該約對於國聯盟約第十六條武力制裁一節如何遵守。在附伴中有明文規定。一味遷就向來軟弱之解釋。今之法俄捷俄兩約則全以國聯之原來精神為根據。明白規定保障締約國之領土。不惜以武力制裁為後盾。是不啻欲起已死之國聯盟約第十條第十六條而復生也。此種性質之條約今尙僅以歐洲一隅為限。他日如能推行於全球。始可謂為集體和平制之成功。</p>
<p>或謂法捷與俄所訂之互援公約。不脫形成對德連鎖之意義。吾人如仍以戰前之目光觀之。則此說實持之有故。反之。如以戰後之新精神而作估量則。或有不盡如是者。蓋吾人一按法俄捷俄兩約。其議定書之末節。固明明規定邀請德波以及波羅的海諸國一致加入。共成所謂東歐洛卡諾也。此種規定是否締約國之眞意所在。可不具論。然較之一八九四年法俄同盟之專事對德者。則一拒一迎之間固大有出入也。</p>
<p>就現狀觀之。東歐公約之成敗唯德國之態度自視。不待智者而喻。然德國東疆以外尙有一千五百萬之條頓人處於異族統洽之下。以德之強。自不甘作爾自縛。然則所謂集體和平制之完成。卽以歐洲而言。亦尙不能一蹴而幾也。</p>

<h3 id="c75">日本農村經濟的新動向 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 日本通信</p>
<p>日本的農村、因了世界的不景氣賦稅的繁重、以及去年空前未有的天災、經濟上陷於異常的窘迫、一般農民、難以為生、據農林省和內務省調查、需要救濟的農家、在旱災區域像九州·香媛·香川一帶、有二十二萬六千一百八十一戶、在凶作區域、像鹿兒島·宮城縣·石川縣帶、有十一萬九千九百四十一戶、在蠶業區域、像山梨·羣馬·長野·琦玉·愛知·三重·岐阜·滋賀·島根等縣、有四十一萬二千九百二十六戶、全部有七十五萬九千零四十八戶、政府當局鑒於形勢的嚴重、去年特開臨時會議、討論救濟辦法今春通常議會中、就通過了巨額的救災預算社會方面、則近年來盡力提倡農村自力更生運動、此等措施、雖不能根本救濟農村、但農村經濟的勁向、却已因而轉到自給化·商業化·工業化·合理化和共同化的途上了、</p>
<p>日本農民近年所以成覺到經濟的竭蹶、是因為維持不了自給自足的原則、受着商工業者榨取的緣故、現在農村方面、就致力於恢復自給自足的生活、提倡自給自足的手工業、在衣着方面、大家採用農村中所出產的絲織物和棉織物、飲食方面、大家採用村內所出產的食物、就是酒和醬油之類、也由農民自己釀造、不復依賴商人的供給、最於農村經濟有關的肥料、往往在農村內智識階級領導之下、由農民自己製造、自己供給、單就這一項說、在岐阜一縣、每年就可節省日金三百萬、因為農民向來在農忙時賒買肥料、要出重利、還須經過兩三個商業機關、等到入農民之手、價略已經高出許多了、不過在自給自足的原則下、也有幾種矛盾的現象、例如農村小學生、拋棄木展、改穿橡皮鞋等等、農村消費者對於此等情形、正在考慮辦法、要使工商業者不能從中取利、</p>
<p>據靜　縣靑邊村的村務報告、自昭和二解度起、到五年度為止、全村每年要負日金四萬餘元的債、自從六年度起、勵行自給自足的經濟制度、一切消費品除必須　村外購買者外、都由村中人自己供給、結果非但不負債、並月每年平均能盈餘日金二萬七千五百四十元以上、從此許多農村、都看靑邊村的樣，趨向自給化了不過今日之社會生活、非常複雜、絕對自給化、是不可能的、况且自給自足所餘的生產品、總得輸到都市上或別的鄉村裏去、農民要排除中問小賣商人和批發商、直接賣給消費者、就趨向商業化了、但是要實行自給自足的生產制度、也非使農村工業化不可、尤其在軍人忙於備戰的所謂「非常時」、要使戰爭雜持永久、必先充實農村的工業、所以陸軍省的軍事預算中、列有「改良農村工業費」的一項、在奈良·大阪·京都一帶的農村、工業化最為顯者、打穀機、精米機等、到處都有、其他副業、也在極力提倡中、</p>
<p>還有最可以注意的一個動向、就是農村的合理化、這種合理化、可分為生產的合理化、私生活的合理化、和公共生活的合理化三種、生產的合理化、是由農會訂定更生計劃書、對於品種的選擇、機器的應用、都加以詳細的指導、私生活的合理化、是利用空屋、作為倉庫、提倡儉婚、節省經濟、公共生活的合理化、例如鄉村的合併、小學校的整理、業餘修道的提倡、日本全國的農村、都在實行着、在北海道一帶的漁業農村、成效最著、在行政人員扶助指導之下、農民實行共同販賣、共同進貨、共同運送、共同育蠶、共同還債、共同作業等等、許多合作社就拋棄營業性質、為大衆的利益而共同化了、</p>
<p>在這種農村經濟新動向展開的時候、農民的思想或許也要有過激的趨向、這是日本政治當局所最擔憂的、（六月十一日於東京）</p>
<h3 id="c76">中德使館決定升格　柏林使錧之喬遷問題 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>柏林通訊、德國國會於五月二十一日下午八時開大會、希特勒宣讀其對外政策十三大綱、歷二小時許、此關係歐洲安危之演說、會塲內固座無餘席、會塲外亦復觀者途塞、甚至全德國皆從無綫電中傾耳以聽、共引起興味如此、是日外交團亦全體參與、而英美義日諸國大使及他國公使、均紛紛起立向我國駐德公使劉崇傑道賀、一時頗惹起觀衆之注意、緣德國政府、已正式發表將駐華公使升格為大使中國政府已復電同意、並取同一之涉驟也、</p>
<p>列強駐華公使升格為大使、言之已久、因蘇聯捷足先登、義大利效法、日本現又繼之、歐洲各國、不甘落後、遂有急轉直下之勢、而德國則唯英國馬首是瞻、相約共同行勤、各有妙用豈待煩言、先是五月十七日下午六時半、德國外交部長請我國劉公使往見、告以德國政府、擬將駐華使館、升格為大使館、希望中國取同一步驟、並徵求對於新大使陶德曼之同意、次日劉公使通知德國外交部畏謂、接奉南京電令、中國政府决定同時將柏林公使館升格為大使館、二十一日劉公使再訪德國外交部、通知中國政府對於新大使、亦覆電同意、中德兩國之互相尊重、已為題明之事實、自此項消息發表後、此間各報皆載之甚詳、注意外交之大報、且著為評論、茲摘譯德意志日報及柏林日報如下、</p>
<p>德意志日報（Deutsche　Allgemline　Zeitung）德政府决定將駐華使節升格為大使之消息將為德各界多數人士所欣幸其他各大國亦將與德國同時派遣大使駐華、大使與公使不同、為國元首之代表、各國此種共同步驟、實為承認中華民國政府近年卓著成效之工作應有之表示、於政治經濟各方面之困難環境中、中國努力建設、百廢並舉、創造中華民族、已有卓絕之進步、</p>
<p>中國經多年內政紛爭、現已大致底定、蔣介石將軍年餘以來、極力從車剿滅典禍之戰爭、亦於最近數月以來、克奏膚功、同時中國雖受東省事變世界經濟恐慌及銀價高漲之影饗妨碍其向上之發展、仍能不假外國財政上之後助、獲得如此之成績、此次列強之舉動、日本亦曾參加、吾人竊願日本此舉不僅為一種表面的好意、却進而為兩國消除舊隙之開塲、則遠束之和平幸甚矣、</p>
<p>柏林日報（Berliner　Tageblatt）義日英美德、均次第將其駐華公使升格為大使、英美德三國均係於同一日宣布、其上項决定、義則首先倡導、自華府會議及一九三年九國公約時起、各國間已互約此事應共同行動、義大利此種舉動、實屬越出班位捷足先登、</p>
<p>義大利之首創此舉、蓋因日本正欲與中國接近、已有將駐平公使升為大使、以助長親善空氣之意但南京政府政治權力之日益強固亦有不少關係、同時所謂一中國問題、」——卽中國將來一方面對菊歐美各國、一方面對日本之關係如何發展之問題、——雖無若何驟然之變化、但已逐步復現於「世界政治」之台前、在蔣介石將軍領導下、中央政府地位之鞏固、以及由政治集中而將聯帶發生之經濟發展、以及中國將　在世界政治舞　之不可預知之地位、對於義大利以及其他各國、多少具有同樣之作用、而成為公使升格之導因、蘇聯則自一九二四年以來、已設大使館於北平矣</p>
<p>德國對華及中國對德之利益、幾全屬經濟的與文化的性質於此兩方面目前雙方正努力經營發展云、</p>
<p>中德兩國、互將公使館升格為大使館、事屬旣定無須討論、惟吾不能已於言者、卽柏林之中國公使館、購自三十年前敝舊狹小、不可名狀、惟以前該區尙為住家區域、今則逐漸變為鬧市、使館與商店為鄰、喧囂特甚、而附近盡為酒樓舞榭、環境尤劣、故使館每有交際深戚侷促不安、聞劉公使蒞任後、又有遷地為良之請、今公使館升格為大使館、原以崇體制、則使館之必須喬遷將與升格同為急務矣、</p>

<p>中國兒童文化協會成立大會特刊本會籌備經過  林蔭　　（一）動機　　本會發起的時候、僅僅只有我和何公超黃寄萍三個人、在工作餘暇隨便談談、目前中國兒童讀物的產量和質量問題感覺得產量雖然多、而質量非常貧乏、尤其是一般讀物的內容形式、都只可給兒童死讀、不能供兒童活用、因此就想組織一個團體聯絡兒童用書的著作人、和小學敎師、來批判舊有的兒童書報、一方面創作新的書報、在這個目標之下、我們就起草了一個緣起、訂幾條簡章、去徵求我們熟識的朋友的竟見、這還是去年七八月間的事、到今年二月裏在那個意見書上簽名的、已經有二十多個人了、特別是董純才白　…他們非常熱烈、就在這時候、我和公超聯名發了張通吿、舉行第一次發起人會議、　　（二）發起人會議　　這一次發起人會議到會的有十九位同志、大家都興高采列的、各人發表對於本會組織的意見、認為兒童文化工作、不僅是書報小部份、目前的書報問題固須批評·創造·而其他兒童文化工作、更有待我們的努力、而且這一工作、不是我們少數人能够負担的、必須聯合全國小學敎師兒童害報編著人繪畫家、出版界和全國兒童的家畏、共同來負起責任才行、因此、决定本會定名為中國兒童文化協會、而以研究兒童問題、發揚兒章文化為宗旨、再徵求同志加人為發起人、擴大我們的工作範圍來共同努力、嗣後有黃警頑·胡叔異·陳濟成·徐豐昶·魏氷心·馬崇淦·孫育才。都很然烈的來參加、我們就在三月二十四那天、舉行第一次發起人會議、到會的有四十多人、一方而進行組織的手續一方面又開始做了許多實際上的工作　　（三）籌備時期的工作　　當然、這短短的三個月籌備時期、是非常忽促的、、而目、兒童節又剛在我們的籌備期內、那時候我們雖然還沒有得到市黨部許可組織的批文、但是、工作旣經擺在眼前、却又不能不做、於是我們就在幾處有集會的地方派了代表去參祝、並且分發本會對於目前兒童文化工作的意見、又請魏氷心同志、在中西雷台播音演講兒童節與家庭敎育、不久市黨部的批文下來了、我們就立刻組織籌備會、籌備趕速成立、又編輯今日之兒童的從書、分請全國敎育家及專鬥有研究的學者分撰稿件、預定兒童年開幕時能够出版、供獻結兒童年的兒童隊伍服務的同志作為參考、並為擴大會務基礎、充實本會力量計、在發起人會議中、議决每一發起人至，至少須徵求會員五人的决議、可為了本會工作的實際化、必須溝通成人與兒童的界限、因此决定歡迎兒童入會會費每年只收兩角使兒童不致有過重的負祖、這時候又剛是上海市舉行剷除文盲運動、我們便立刻覺得這是實際工作的機會、在這運動中應以兒童為中心的實際試騐、就首先特約花村民衆基礎學校和鐫業小學實行小先生制的識字服務團、並推定黃警頑孫育才為指導員、指導小先生怎樣到社會中去參加這項重要工作、本月份起、又假新新電台、每週經常播音演講兒童敎育問題及兒童節目我們雖然只有三個月短短的籌　時期、但是目前的丁作已經逼得不允許再展綏成立了、各處要求組織分會的熱烈、和許多工作必須在成立後方可開始去做、種種原因我們便決定在今天舉行成立大會了、當然在讀草創的時期中、許多工作是不能給人們意的只希望成立以後、全體會員、能够忠誠的工作這不但是本會的光榮也是全國兒童的幸福、我這樣簡單而斷續的報吿、疏漏的地方、當然是不能避免的、還望同志們原諒、兒童的世界  魏冰心　　「二十世紀是兒童的世紀」、這句話是全世界公認的了、的確、要建設進步的社會、創造大同的世界、只有希望後一輩的兒童、將來的世界、是兒童的世界、而現代的兒童、是將來建設社會創造世界的中堅分子、　　你看、現代全世界的那些　兵黷武、爭域略地的軍閥、他們只有稱覇王、奪權利的野心、那裏有假創造和平的世界的雄圖呢、　　你看、現代全世界的那些濫用權威、搬弄是非的政客、他們只有做高官、謀利祿的念頭、那裏有建設良好的社會的計劃、　　你看、現代全世界的那些揮洒血汗、出賣勞力的農工、他們只能為自己謀衣食、免凍餒、缺織的力量、擔當建設社會、改造世界的責任　　你看、現代全世界的那些研求學問、販賣知學者、他們也只能為自己賣文章、尋生路、九量擔當建設社會、改造世界的責任、　　可是、現代人類的高尙理想、雖然受了人十力、種種環境上的阻礙、不能實現、倘若不鼓吹、宜傳、努力奮鬥、到了後一代、必定可　一個人類的樂園、開鮮艷的花、結甜蜜的果、不論是個人的、家庭的、社會的、國家的、乃界的一切問題、都可以圓滿地解决、　　尤其是在國際上次殖民地的我國、要脫離主義的壓迫、而獲得眞正的自中平等、必須的兒童們到了將來、能夠繼續不斷地努力奮鬥、才有實現的可能、　　所以現代的兒童問題、實在是一切問題的總關鍵、他是一切問題的根本問題、在現代的我國、尤其要用全力注重兒童問題、造就將來能够擔負建設進步的社會、創造大同的世界的中國新兒童、　　中國兒童文化協會、是擔負着這個使命、不過迢個使命委實太重大了、希望全國從事兒童文化工作的人士、加入我們的集團、一致努力、我們的工作怎麼樣  何公超　　本會的宗旨是在兒童的範圍內、從事於種種文化工作、（包括文學·藝術·體育……）但是不要以為、只要是文化工作、就有益於兒童、如果我們依舊把以做官發財為結局的故事給兒童聽桃花江之類的歌曲敎兒童唱、這是加惠於兒童呢、還是加害於兒童呢、本會的工作顯然要與這些相反、更詳細一點說、應該是、　　集團主美的而非個人主義的我們要使兒童集團地活動使他們明白、在一個集團之內、每個人都有同等發展、享受的權利、而反對那些養成兒童的個人主義英雄思想、領袖慾望的活動、　　奮鬥的而非享樂的即使是組繳一次兒童旅行、我們决不是備了一節專車、請兒童們到那些山明水秀的地方逍遙一下、而應該像淮安某小學的小朋友似的由兒童自己去乘車、去參觀、讓他們領受車站職員的白眼、而知道人生道上的險阻、讓他們訪問上海的印度阿三和貧民窟裏的同胞而知道亡國奴和做亡國奴的痛苦、　　為多數人的而非為少數人的我們的工作應置其重心於全國百分之力十以上的貧窮兒童上面、因此在地域上講、我們不應該專在上海的住宅區裏兜圈子、而應該向鄉村和工廠區發展、在知識程度上講、我們不應該只和學校兒童打交道、而應該和文盲兒童握手、在財富標準上講、我們不應該只曉得向富家兒女討好、而應該為那些無衣乏食的貧兒努力、　　前面的而非落後的我們一切工作（如一本兒歌、一冊故事、一次音樂播送）中所含的思想·觀念。應該是前進的革命的積極的樂觀的、而不應該是消極的·悲觀的·不革命的、我們更反對那些迷信的傳說。神怪的故事、因果報應的觀念、和山林隱逸等退避人生的思想、　　本會的工作、如果依據了前述的一條路走去、才能在這一歷史階段中、盡了必須盡的任務，否則、恐將　落而為徒然點綴昇平的機關吧了、二十世紀是兒童的世紀  陳濟成　孫育才　　二十世紀是由女權運動、而達到兒實權利擴張的世紀、愛倫凱女十簡直稱為這是「兒童的世紀、」兒童本位的重要、世界各國早已感覺到、對於兒童事業亦已深切的注意着在進展蘇俄本是社會主義的國家、他們不但廣設托兒所、敎義一般勞工的兒童、並目還有許多特殊的組織、像兒童科學研究所兒童美術研究所等充分地培養兒童身心兩方面的發展、意大利是法西斯的國家、他們對於靑年黨人的培養、分三期訓練、一面鍜鍊體格、一面授以黨義也認為敎育兒童是國家最重大的一種事業、德國在大戰以後、常具報仇復興的决心、一面發展科學、努力建設、面却注意兒童敎育、以栽培國本、兒童是國家未來的主人翁、中國要求民族復興、與家富强、最基本最重要的工作、就是要注重兒童事業、中國兒童文化恊會、就是注意兒童文化事業的一個新團體、在這裏我們都願為兒童謀福利、爽快的說一句、亦就是努力民族復興運動工作、今日舉行成立大會　　—下午二時在大陸商塲申報業補習學校—　　潘公展陶行知演講　　歡迎各界人士參加　　中國兒童文化恊會、呈准市黨部、於今日下午二時、假大陸商塲三樓申報業餘補習學校、舉行成立大會、除討論會章提案及選舉外、並請潘公展·陶行知兩氏演講、該會並商得各大報之同意、出版特刊、以引起各界人十對兒童文化工作之注意、今日大會並歡迎來賓參加、大會職員如下、主席團五人、陳濟成·胡叔異·黃寄萍（大會中准兩人）籌備會代表、林蔭、記錄、白桃董純才、司儀、何公超、幹事、孫育才·錢選靑·黃警頑、體育消息浙江省選派參加全運代表名單　男女球類田徑基本代表已決定　另擬各項補充名單擇期再競選　　浙省選派全國運動會代表、前經派送國挑選委員會討論辦法、分別選派、茲悉派送委員會於前晚召開會議、决定男女田徑球類基本隊員、及擬定補充隊員、定期測騐、是會出席委員蘇景由。舒鴻。程康初。李信標·毛志恒二祝家聲。劉啓松·徐澤予（董世楨代）、許紹棣·徐汝康·趙季俞·林端甫·李振夏、主席許紹棣、紀錄趙季俞、甲、報吿事項、（略）、乙、討論事項、議决案如下、　　男子球類基本隊員　　（一）撰選男子各項球類基本隊員請審議案、決議、修正通過、名單附近後、一、籃球、徐亭、程明覺、劉端生、華興衡（杭市）二、足球劉一之、佘勉初、劉祖侃、林堅學、馬世昌、張明生（航空）、三、排球、吳貽蓀趙蘊修、、趙崇活、伍均耀、黃榮發（藝專）、四網球、劉祖侃、戴廣進（航空、　　男子球類補充隊員　　（二）男子各項球類其他隊員、應如何袖充案、决議分別决定如下、、籃球、於七月初召禁左列各員表演挑選之、（名單）武振華、魏國志、楊春瑞、范金山、黃運良、（以上航空）、林澤群、五號、八號、（以上航空）、李永炤、王弘法、（以上浙大）、姜振華、（以上之江）、朱法和、盧汝淳（以上杭　）、（蕙蘭名單另提）、二、足球、先以左列各員補充、不足易行設法補充、許雪雷、徐祖林、王世鐸、徐享（以上杭市）、楊家樑（以上之江）、盧汝淳、張連吉（以上杭高）、三、排球、除補充張錫祐、徐亨一員外、於七月初召集左列各員表演挑選之、林堅學、曹鼎漢、李振奇、周錫年（以上航空）、會新泉、　觀佑、勞元熙、朱汝楫、何毅、何述聖（以上藝專）、陳榮麟（以上民衆）、四、網球補充郭啓達（待詢問出席資格後定）郭彭年（以上諸曁）、陳乃新（杭市）、　　女子球類參加代表　　（三）女子各項球類隊員、應如何挑選派送、請討論案、（決議）一、派送籃球　隊、二、基本隊員由弘道隊挑選、三、約期召集弘道、杭高、女中、醫專、表演挑選决定之、　　男子田徑基本代表　　（四）擬選田徑賽運動員人選、請審議案、（决議）修正通過名單附後、（一百公尺）陳若文（之江）、（二百公尺）陳祖蔭（之江）、（四百公尺）李延祥（上虞）、陸祖蔭（之江）、（八百公尺）、洪用棠（回浦）、彭仁忭（航空）、李延祥（上虞）、（千五百公尺）洪用棠（回沛）、（一萬公尺）柴煥錦（高蠶）、仲明揚（杭市）、（四百公尺中欄）傅作霖（之江）、（鉛球）袁和（航空）、（鐵餅）張世明（航空）、（標槍）徐保　（航空）、（跳高）梁添成（航空）（跳遠）李水炤（浙大）、（三級跳）梁添成（航空）、（十項）張世明、（航空）、　　女子田徑基本代表　　女子田徑名單如下、（五十公尺）鄒志慧（警官）、（一百公尺）何每（女中）、鄭雪華（女中）、（百公尺）鄭雪華（女中）、（八十公尺低欄）陳難（警官）、（跳高）（閔采芝（湖郡）、（跳遠）鄭雪華（女中）、（壘球）鄭淸（女中）、　　男子田徑補充代表　　（五）主席提議、李培德（二百公尺）、陳嘉應（撐竿跳）、周志龍（撐竿跳）、三人成績尙好、擬予附帶訓練、請討論案、（决議）先行徵求本人同意、三角友誼足球第一戰　青年對沙壳爾　今日下午四時半……申園　　靑年與沙壳爾兩足球隊、於今日下午四時半、在中園足球場舉行三角友誼聯賽之第一戰、雙方均屬後起勁旅、養精蓄銳、巳有時日、對壘競技、當有精彩表演也、裁判員沈回春、門券一律小洋六角、青島國術市考開幕　　（靑島十五日）第三屆國術市考、十五晨八時半、在體育塲舉行、參加男女選乎三百二十餘人、李烈鈞韓　　沈鴻烈等均到塲、由沈領導開會、致詞、李歸演說、繼開始考試表演、各選手精神抖擻、各展所長、極為精彩、午休息、一時半績賽、五時完畢、因是晨濃霧、午後細雨、為大會减色不少、中華足球會委請　余衡之任中華隊管理　　上海中華足球會委員會、為準備派上海中華隊赴爪哇比賽、特於昨晚假鄧脫摩飯店、開會討論球隊代表、及經費事、歷一小時、散曾、議决案如下、　　（一）委請管即余衡之、酌量需要人數、於中華足球隊中選擇、隊員準備出發、（二）

<p>春秋兒童週刊國界  夏中漢　　小朋友們！你們對於中國的國界知道沒有？我們是中國人，就應該明暸中國的土地，否則不免要被外國人侵佔去，那是最苦痛不過的事呵！我現在講一則淸末外交痛史給你們聽：　　「某欽差出使到×國去，×國是和中國交界的，淸廷正要劃淸國界，就託他順便調杳調查。某欽差受了這種重託，自然是很留心的，一到×國，就呌人收買國界交錯的地圖。一天，某欽差買到一幅極精密詳細的地圖，他非常得意，把那地圖帶回中國，譯成了中文，獻給淸廷，就據此繪定了二國交界圖。但是，過了許多時候，經人調查出來，那×國的原圖，把中國的地方一塊，繪入了×國的界綫裏面，而且他們還是故意繪了欺騙中國欽差的。」　　小朋友們！你們看：滿淸官吏，對於外交完全不懂，這些最可痛的送地的事情，不知多少呢。現在是弱肉强食的時代了，如果照那個可憐的糊塗的欽差那樣，將來中國土地怎樣呢？　　小朋友呵！國家主人翁的責任很重大的啊！司梯芬生的幼年  穡秋　　英國火車發明家司梯芬生，是一個採煤礦夫的兒子，因為他父親每月的收入，不能維持一家生活，所以他不但沒有進學校讀書的福份，而且到了八歲，就去做人家的牧童，每天賺八分錢的工資，來補助家裏的用度。　　他到了十五歲，又受了父親之命，到礦穴裏當一名火夫的練習生，一天到晚，面上塗滿了煤灰，弄得像鬼臉一般。但他一點不灰心，工作非常努力，同時還去研究礦塲裏機器的構造。　　他到了十七歲，方才達到求學的目的。可是他的求學，那裏有小朋友們這樣舒服，這樣快樂，一切都由火母負担，小朋友們一點不要煩心。他卻是一方面做工，一方面讀書，購買書籍的費用，還是替人家擦皮鞋賺來的錢呢。　　他對於機器的構造，感到特別興趣，所以工作和讀書之暇，不斷地研究着。一天，礦塲裏一具引擎損壞了，許多工程師都沒有方法把它修好，大家以為這具引擎，已沒有希望了。可是，司梯芬生竟然挺身出來，把那引擎修好，使礦塲裏的全體工作人員，感到大大的驚異。　　從此他格外精心研究，環境雖然惡劣，他都不顧，他終於在困苦的奮鬥中能够衝破環境，得到新的生命。　　瞧吧！鐵路之網，已環繞了全世界，那蜿蜒如長蛇的東西，不絕地載着人們，轟轟地到處顯着它的威風。這不是司梯芬生給與的遺產嗎？　　小朋友！你們牢記着，只有努力奮鬥，纔是人們的生路。早操  泗安蓓蕾小學十一歲男顏文采　　淸早起，　　學體操，　　天天早操身體好，　　身體好為國効勞！　　禦外侮，　　打强盜，　　讓我喚醒小同胞，　　快快起來學早操！智仁勇  妙神　　在學校中念書的小朋友，大槪都知道童子軍有三個字的信條，呌：智仁勇。差不多每個童子軍要牢記這智仁勇三字在心頭，童子軍的徽章以及旗幟等，多用三角形的，也是表示智仁勇三字的象徵。那末智仁勇三字應怎樣講呢？　　我們先以一件事情作譬喻，譬如你看見一個人失足墮入河中，那末你自然應當設法去救他。假如你是不會游泳的，而你貿然跳入河中，則你的性命必將沒有希望，這是「從井救人」的笨事。你如能隨手找尋一根木頭或木板，丟入河中，則落水的人抱着了木質東西，便得浮起不死，於是你冉想法救他起來，這就呌智。　　假如你望見有人落水，而認為事不干己，所行無事，這就缺乏了人類互助的精神，不能算是受過敎育的人，也可以說沒有做人的資格。你看見了人家落水，應當如自溺一般，把救護的責任，視為己任，所謂「當仁不讓」，這就呌仁。　　見了有人落水，你有救護的心，同時你也懂得些游泳的門徑，而不敢跳下水去救他，只呆望着落水的人在水中一浮一沉，終於溺死了。你對於這個溺斃的人，表示無限的傷心，並為了自己沒有去救他，覺得非常的不安，這固然你的心是仁了，可是勇在那裏呢？要知道你的力量除非絕對不生效力之外，你總應不計利害，奮身向前幹你應幹的事。一個有用的靑年，多少要帶些勇氣的！你如能為了人類的義務而能奮身去救他，這便呌勇。　　諸位小朋友要明白：智仁勇並不是僅僅屬於童子軍的信條，是每個小朋友所應當服從的信條。三雄競賽兒童科學講座植物的莖  林蔭　　我們上次講過根，說根好像動物的四肢。那麽，今天所講的莖，又像動物的什麽呢？莖，好像動物的軀幹。動物的身體，需要軀幹骨來支持，彷彿一間屋子，要樑相柱。植物的莖，就是它的軀幹。你看，一株樹，根生在地下泥土裏，在地上豎着一根粗大的幹，就是莖。再從莖上生出枝條，長出葉子。所以，根有向下的特性，而莖恰恰相反，它的特長是向上生長，（圖一）但是，難道沒有生長在泥土中的莖嗎？好像蓮花，它的莖，不是生長在泥土中的嗎？它的莖，就是藕，而根却生在莖節間，又從莖節間，長出很長的枝條把葉片托出水面，這種莖，呌地下莖。（圖二）在地下生長的莖，也有好幾種。我們平常吃的荸薺，就是其中之一，它的莖上，長着芽，長着管狀的葉。但形狀像球，所以我們稱他為球莖。百合，洋葱的莖也生在地下，但它們是鱗片形的東西包成的，我們稱之為鱗莖。（圖三）　　莖的作用，除了支持身體以外，還營着分配養分的責任。根在地下把水分吸收以後，就要靠着莖把養分分佈給枝葉，這樣枝葉才會茂盛，它好像搬運夫一樣，把養料四處分送。　　樹的莖，還給我們一種便利，就是我們可以從樹幹的橫斷面上，看得出這棵樹的年紀。這樹面上一輪輪的痕跡，就是樹每年生長一次的標記。（圖四）我們看上面有幾輪，就明白這樹生長着幾年了。壁虎尾巴節節活  拾玖　　「壁虎尾巴節節活，」這是蘇州的一句俗語。凡是一個人主見不定，忽而這樣，忽而那樣，蘇州人總把這句俗語來形容他。這話眞再確切也沒有了，因為壁虎的尾巴，果眞是節節會活的　　壁虎尾巴何以節節會活？這，研究起來，倒是一件很有興趣的事。原來一切鳥獸昆蟲，同人是一樣的，也要能够自衛，才能保全自己的生命，不會絕種。壁虎不過是一小小爬蟲，自然隨時隨地有遇到對敵的危險。當它的尾巴被敵捕獲時，試想它怎能脫身呢！幸而宅的尾巴節節會活，所以當它被捕時，它卽把尾巴迅速地和本體脫離，獻給對敵。這樣，它就能躲至安全處，保存它的生命了。　　據生物學家告訴我，這種動物自衛的方法，呌做「自割」，是「生態自衛」的一種。至被捕處自割後，則會再生的。除壁虎的尾巴外，像蟹脚，蝗蟲脚，也都能够自割自生。　　壁虎本名守宮。現在夏天到了，牆壁上，門窗上，常可以見到那壁虎在爬動著。它是在找蟲吃，所以壁虎實在是有益於人類的。我們見了它，固不必怕它，且亦不可打死它。有些老年人往往把「壁虎尾巴會鑽進小孩的耳朵裏吃腦子」的話驚嚇小朋友，你們不要信他。動物之壽命  元　　蚯蚓　十年　　靑蛙　十年　　螞蟻　十五年　　蟬　二日　　螢　十日　　蜜蜂　六年　　鹫　一百十年　　烏　十年　　金魚　約三十年　　龜　四十年　　書蠹　二年　　蜉蝣　五小時　　鱷　二百年　　蝴蝶　五十日狐與鵝  月麒　　——西班牙童話——　　一隻狐和一隻鵝是很要好的朋友。那鵝，你們知道，是很忠厚很勤懇的為。一天，它對那狐說道。。　　「朋友，我有小小一塊土地，要是你願意，我就分一半給你。」　　「那我很高興，」那狐回答。　　「那麼，到了耕種的時候，我們就應大家動手，」那鵝說。　　「很好，」那狐回答。　　過了若干日，，它們又會見了，那鵝說道：　　「現在應得動手播種了。」　　「這是你的事，」那狐說，「不必叫我管」。　　過了若干月，那鵝說道：　　「蕪草多得很，我們非把日裏的草刈除不可，朋友。」　　「很好，」那狐回答，「你去管吧；這不是我的事。」　　過了不久，那鵝對那狐說道：　　「朋友，麥巳熟了，我們應動乎割。」　　「很好，」那狐同答，「你去管吧；這不是我的事。」　　那鵝雖然十分忠厚，這時候也開始懷疑了；它把事情吿訴打它面前走過的它的朋友獵狗。　　聰明的獵狗，立即明自這是那狐欺侮着那忠厚的鵝，便對它說；　　「割下麥，放在麥倉裏，用麥桿遮住我的身子，只留出一隻眼睛，讓我可以看到將有什麽事情發生。」　　那鵝依照它的話辦；過了一會，那狐到來；它看到滿倉是新割下的麥，非常快活，且跳目唱：　　「哦，哦，　　麥全是我的！　　哦，哦，　　桿和麥全是我的！」　　它唱着，跳到裏面有那獵狗躱匿着的一堆麥桿前面，看見麥桿縫裏一隻眼睛，便說：　　「啊，是一粒葡萄啦！」　　「這可不是葡萄啦，」那獵狗回答，它從麥桿堆裏跳出來，把那狐殺死了。兒童園地電燈  安溪小學十四歲學生王守仁　　電燈呀電燈。　　你的光多麼晶瑩。　　你晚上能照我們讀書　　使我的學間有長進。　　我欽佩你的力量偉大。　　我戚謝你把黑暗照成光明。小鷄　　三隻活潑的小鷄。　　同在草地上遊戲。　　吱唧！吱唧！吱唧！　　一會兒往東。一會兒往西。　　找着小蟲和白米。　　大家同吃不分離。吱唧！吱唧！　　吱唧！這是三個好兄弟。燈罩沾了水為什麽會破殘裂？  寗自强　　小朋友！你們有的是住在都市，有的却是住在鄉村，在都市住的，電燈照耀，如同自畫；但是在鄉村中間住的，美孚燈卻是時代的產兒，少他不得。　　當你們點美孚燈溫習功課的時候，偶一不愼，罩子上沾着了水，或者在點着之後，濺着一點水，隨時隨地，罩子都有破裂的危險。　　燈罩上染了水為什麽破裂的？恐怕小朋友知其然，而不知其所以然罷！現在讓我來吿訴你：燈罩是一種玻璃質，這是大家都知道的，凡物熱則膨脹，冷則收縮，於玻璃質也不能例外，燈罩上染了水，點着之後，全部都膨脹，祇有染水的一小部分要收縮，來了一過賬縮的不平衡，運有破裂的危險了！動物瑣話  冰玉　　河馬，我們在電影中，想來已經看見過的，河馬二字看起來好像與馬相同的東西，其實面貌，六分像猪，四分像馬。這獸產於非洲，體重數千斤，比象稍小，口大如缸，胃能納一石二斗的食物，在山野中尋食穀黍雜草，一畝的稻，祇可供牠吃三天，所以為動物中食量最大的獸。但動作滯鈍畫間成羣隱伏於樹蔭下的池沼中，過了五六分鐘，鼻面就要浮出水面，呼吸空氣。河馬產子，是在岸邊的蘆葦中，產後過了五六天，小河馬就會爬到母親的背脊上，沉在水中。但小河馬時欲吸收空氣，所以母親嘗嘗浮到水面，可是為防水面與岸邊，恐怕有加害的仇敵，預先探望四周後，才敢七陸游行。白天岸上沒有可食的東西，那就在水底覓食水草，到了日暮　　二三十四的大羣，到田野去覓食，大凡為河馬走過　地方，其黍榖夥粒無遺。它們步行時，全靠鼻的嗅覺，就是一面走一面嗅，雖然走到極遠的地方，也會噢出出原路回到池沼中的。非洲的土人，因為農產物受了河馬的害，非常痛恨，往往在黍田中，布置毒箭，或在歸路，設了陷阱，或駕獨木舟，在水上槍殺。然河馬本來膽怯，平時不會害人，不過到了自身危急的時候，那也要咬人了。譬如土人駕舟捕捉河馬時，它就要猛烈抵抗的。土人捕到河馬時，剝皮生食，在皮下的肉，土人非常珍貴。河馬的大齒，質甚堅銳，可製細工，皮為黑色，用以製鞭與機械的調帶。其中還有一點，就是牛馬羊豬等類，為厚蹄，動物學上稱為有蹄類，蹄數有偶有奇，河馬有四個蹄，所以是屬於偶蹄類的動物。　　（消息）中國兒童文化協會於今日（九日）正午十二時至一時，假新新電台（週波七八〇）播音，請魏冰心先生主講，題為「現代中國的兒童敎育問題一。並約市立養正小學歌唱團播最新歌曲，請小朋友們注意。玩具  文煥水手辛白德傳（二三）  心靑　　「書發自印度羣島之土、他跟前有一百頭象排列著走去、他住在一所大廈中，墻壁上有名貴的紅寶石閃閃地亮着，他是極有錢的。我所送上的禮物是很微小的，請收下來以表示我的受你。　　那送給我國王的禮物有幾件是很奇怪而難得的東西。有一隻精美的杯子，半尺高一寸厚，是用一塊極名貴的紅寳石製成的；一條蛇皮，給病人躺在上面，便可康健的；又有分量極重的沈香木；而末一件却是一個美貌的女奴，穿着一身華貴的衣服。　　到得我們動身的時間到時，王便召了那船中的領袖來，吩咐他在我船上時須得分外的照顧我，待我如一個大人物一樣，他又同樣的知照那上船去做買賣的人。　　我們出發了，末後來到日爾沙拉，再由那邊上巴克達去，將我所帶的禮物陳在我王的脚下。他喚我把所知西林迭富王的事情吿知他。　　我說完後，王便向我說：「這王的偉大和富裕可是眞如他之所說麽？」　　我投身在王的脚邊說：　　「呀！王！凡是他所說的都是眞的，因為我在他的地方曾親見他如何的富裕和偉大。他的侍從中有貴人；他有一個象背上的寳座；他的寶石又大又很値錢，他的為人又公正又良善」。　　我說了這些話，我王滿懊的快樂，當我下朝回家去時，他就送與我一件名貴的禮物。</p

<p>婦女園地閒荒  碧遙　　報上時常載的：國內許多地方，這一村莊嚴了人，那村莊的羣狗聞着了腥氣，都丟了守門之職，爭來舐人頭人血。老頭兒們見了這物性反常，只當是天道上變，的驚走駭怪。　　其實這沒有甚麽　駭得。現在那兒的村莊，不都是家徒四壁？做狗也十分間得乏味兒，自然到那有喇叭聲有血腥的地方去解解悶。這正是物性之常。　　無論甚麽東西，到閒得發慌時就喜歡怪味新奇。病人睡在床上想吃這椿那椿，就是這個道理。　　年來舉國拚死釘住女人，可眞是女人有大不了的地方？無非是揀着這異味兒來療他們的閒荒一。所以凡是牽掛了靑年女人的事件，沒有不釀成風雨滿城。試看最近的「濟南桃色案」，如何的轟動人心！　　「（濟南快信）轟動全國之濟南敎育廳指導員周光炎，其妻女子師範學生王志先，被兵工廠職員王崇范誘姦偕逃，造成桃色情變案件後，本省全體公務員，均一致憤慨，擬請省府韓復榘氏嚴追……詎王等竟於本月四日，在江蘇省首都迤北之六合縣，同時被捕。消息傳播到魯之後，一向沉寂之桃色情變案件，社會大為靈動，空氣又突緊張，各方竟見仍一致主張嚴辦一。　　除此之外，又載各地靑年學生慰問周光炎的書信多件，並多有為周代出主意。回顧六月一日以來，平津一帶，無人不被暑熱逼得汗流浹背；而齊魯地方，卻正在暖和和地為桃花顚倒，為桃花憤慨，為桃花緊張，背河一衣帶水之隔，南北便有這般天壤之別！　　四萬萬人中一對男女的結合或分離，關係於他人可有毛頭大的損益？而社會人十以至於有守土護民之責的公務人員，也都為此而動公憤，其為「閒荒」，當可瞭然。人人害着閒荒一，斤斤於男女之私，國事怎得不大可觀？　　閒之來源，有的是目己偷得，有的是他人付與。自愛的固然不至偷閒，同時也不至守着他人給與的空閒。鄉村跑到他村去舐血腥的羣狗，是離亂的人們給與了牠一個冷落空閒的位；狗是畜生，不能與人爭，牠是可以安於那個地位。若至於不可偷閒的次殖民地的國民，也還墮於「閒荒」而不能自拔，那他是把自己比於何種東西呢？　　我們不願見女界中有那種一間荒一的人物，如醉如痴地墮人情網，演出超乎理性的像劉逯那種的桃色事件。我們更不願見患了「閒荒」的男性，一味尖着鼻子嗅女人，層出不窮地扮演桃色事件或為他人的桃色事件緊張。因為現社會是以男性為中心，一切使社會國守沉淪湮滅的罪惡，他們是有大半責任的。婦女問題講座第四節　法國大革命與婦女  君慧　　現在的資平主美社會，自然不是，時突然出現的東西。牠是經過種種發展階段，並且必須經過工商市民的堅决的爭取才得實現出來。這種發展階段可分為三。即第一次宗敎革命（一五一七），第二次英國革命（一六八八），第三次就是工商市民最後獲得政權的法國大革命。　　法國大革命是對於婦女解放運動及思潮上給與了很大的影響。這種影響特別在有名的人權宣言中最充分的表現出來。從來在封建的絕對王政之下，一切平民大衆完全失去了一人」的地位，至於婦女史不待說是命運注定的奴隸。少數封建特殊人民，任意吸取大衆的血汗，為所欲為，過着地上天堂的生活，而多數從事生產的人們，尤其婦女却受盡現世的地獄痛苦。在這種現狀下，市民階級起來了！舉起目由，平等，友愛，的旗子，宣言人民的權利，向封建勢力進攻。他們的旗子，他們的主張是名正霄順，理直氣壯，於是乎，冬年苦於被壓榨的工人及農民羣衆都很熱烈的參加革命陣綫，被壓迫最甚的婦女們更勇敢的參加大衆的叛亂。結果，專制王國被打倒，工商市民奪取政權，成立了新政府，但直接流血的工農羣衆及婦女們呢，不單得不到什麽權利，反而遭了新政府的鎭壓和屠殺！他們祇不過以新的壓迫對象來替代那舊的罷了。　　雖然如此，法國大革命總算結束了歷史上重要的進化階段。從此以後，人類的物質的乃續神的文明，不受任何的拘束，很快的發達起來，遂做成了燦爛的現代文化。　　法國革命時的人權宣言以及美國的獨立宣言（一七七六），是人類解放史上有深長意義的劃時代的文獻。牠不但表示出一切被壓迫人民的要求，同時對於久巳失去人權的婦女大衆給與了很深刻很有力的暗示。獨立宣言中說：「人類是平等的，有天賦的權利，對於生命自由，幸福的權利等乃是其最主要者。政府是為擁護此等權利而被組織，其權力的淵源在於人民的合意。」人權宣言中也有如下的主張：「第一條，人類在出生及生存上有自由平等的權利，社會的不平等楚除了為着公共利益外不容存在，第二條，一切政治的結合目的，在於保設人類的天賦而不可侵犯的權利。』這裏雖然沒有單獨指出婦女的權利，但婦女即寫人類的一份子，自然要取得和男子同樣自由和平等的一切權利。美國獨立戰爭和法國革命後，市民社會雖然並沒有給婦女以何等權利，但以上兩種宣言，的確成為婦女們開始要求一切人權的主要契機。　　法國革命當時，一方而在工商市民的婦女中已經產生了充分吸收近代自由主義思想的多數知議婦女層，他面，隨着工業生產的擴大，在各中心都市，特別在巴黎和馬賽，女工數目可驚的增加，這兩種婦女在革命的叛亂中形成了主要的戰鬥部隊。據歷史的紀載，巴黎的女工們參加佔領巴士齊爾監獄的鬥爭，女工們是以羅莎拉哥姆布，瑪得連沙布利，列奶奧珠等為領袖而組織凡爾賽進擊隊。特別引起與趣的是由婦女衛兵之手，把路易十六護送到巴黎的事情。　　法國革命中，有兩個主要的婦女領袖，一是鐵羅紐，一是拉哥姆布。鐵羅紐具有熱烈的戰鬭的性格，她領導羣衆占領巴士齊爾監獄，因此國民議會為着表彰她而贈與有名譽的寳劍。十月五日進攻凡爾賽的那天，她為支持婦女們的革命精神，穿了赤色衣裳而騎馬向凡爾賽進擊。八月十日，她為着擁護共和政府，在廣塲上澈夜演講，要求確立眞正人民的最高權力。　　拉哥姆布也是參加凡雨賽進軍的一女性。她是巴黎郊外勞苦婦女的眞正的指導者。她常和下層婦女羣衆生活，她是有卓越的組織才能，優美的聲昔和容姿的女人。她從立法會議的傍聽席大喊：「從聯合軍的侵入防衛革命」！同時要求「權力大衆化」十八月十日圍攻王宮的時候，她的臂部受了傷。國民會議特贈給她榮耀的「市民冠」。她創設「革命婦女俱樂部一，以革命的精神敎育婦女大衆。她是有名雄辯的女買哥邦黨員，她不單主張婦女的權利，同時要求大衆婦女的利益。她高喊：　　「在共和制度底下，婦女所得到的利益為什麽喲」！　　編輯室　　自王孝英先生在本刋發表給一婦女青年的主筆釋因」的論婦女運動一女後，讀者卽紛紛來稿，各抒己見，婦女運動之被人們關心，于此可見。茲擬于下期擇要披露，作公開討論，請讀者特別注意。過着耗子生活的少女們  茜　　自從責任在　街彌的小樓上，而認淸了這一帶的畸形社會以來，有兩種聲響，敲着我的耳鼓，便會使我不能自主地發抖。——那是捕房汽車的喇叭聲，和西種的機器脚路車的「多多一聲。　　這條街，八年前還是作為鬼域的墳地，自一二八戰爭暴發的那一天起，它便開始發吒膨眼，直至今日，它的繁榮的位置，快追上安南路赫德路口了。這兒每晨菜市的與旺　喧囂，實屬非常可觀。菜塲是由衆菜戶每晨夾沿街擺攤的臨時菜塲，這除了在人家門前個連一個的攤頭外，便是無數提着一二隻籃，或挑着兩個簍的邊走邊呌賣的菜販。這種菜販，以女人，尤其少女居多，她們中間十個有九個是沒有公開的小販照會的。　　我們中國人，住在帝國主義者所租借去，而本應是我們自國的領地的租界里，非但人不納　捐房捐，不得住屋，車不納車捐，不得載人通行，做生意的，沒有營業照會，也休想混口飯吃。這些賣菜的少女，旣無在租界營業的執照，而又要在租界內混飯吃，所以她們的營業情形，完全是倫愉摸摸，像耗子一樣的。她們每兜攔一顧客時，首先總要左顧右盼，前仰後瞻，看一時有無巡捕到來的危險。尙看沒有，她們便慢慢地計較菜價（據一般實情，這種菜販賣的菜，比菜攤上的使宜），但若瞥見老遠夾了一個巡捕，她們便馬馬虎虎拿點錢就往附沂的衖堂或小巷里躱，有此情形急了，她們往往來不及收錢，提起籃或肩起擔拔步便跑。這時菜巳裝進了自已菜籃里的顧客們，。腸狠的人，每每在這當兒乘火打劫，提起籃便走：巡捕過去後，那些受了損失的賣菜少女，也只得自認晦氣。　　這種捕房追捕無照會的菜販的奇景，要算上午九十點鐘最兇了。那時菜塲的生意正吒，滿街都擠滿了賣菜和買菜時，舉目一望，眼前盡是烏黑黑的人頭，好像浮滿了西瓜的一倏大河。突的，在大家不知中，老遠停下了輛捕房汽車，車中走下幾個西捕和中捕，不久，菜塲里便會起一陣大騷動的那些此照會的菜販，眞是個個駭得抱頭亂竄，結果，每晨汽車里總會載去五六個不幸的人。當這汽車響着它特有的喇叭而開走時，我的心就會在我身中下沈。　　據一賣菜女吿訴找，她們賣菜第一次去捕房登記，需大洋七元，以後每月需冉繳大洋二　換照會一次。無照會被帶至捕房時，每次罰洋五角，無錢，則坐班房一日。至於她們每日的營業，至多賣得一千冬銅元，好時，可賺三四百文，不好時兩三百一二百文也說不定。這樣，她們五六天的全部賺賬，也不够受一次的處罰，買照會更說不上，何况她們每日還要一點東西來度命呢，這便是她們所以度着耗子生活的原因吧。　　和這種賣菜女度着　樣生活——耗子生活——的少女，還有終日蹀　街頭叫賣零食的小販。近來　種小販，街頭是，天多一天了。她們　是鄉下十街不久的毛丫頭，這只看她們那翹翹辮子上的紅頭繩，和她們那滿身滿臉的鄉氣土氣便可明白。她們賣的物品，隨着季　而變換，天未熱時，賣地栗漸次變而為自糖梅子，山東枇，現在是在賣大甜桃子。杷捕房對於這些小販，中午下午雖沒有專車來把她們大批地載去，但乘着機器脚踏車的西捕，和乘普通脚踏車的中捕，每隔一小時就要來街頭巡查次。追捕起來時，他們是乘着車追的，可憐這些黃毛丫頭為了生活為了性命，不得不把視覺聽覺都訓練得像耗子一般敏銳，而跑起來時，眞是要打起蹄子飛來。　　一天，一個十三四歲的少女小販，提着筐枇杷忘命地向隔壁衖堂里飛跑，我趕下去看時，她止像匹死老鼠樣歪在拉埃桶側邊，面色慘白，而一面嘴里還在歇斯底里地喃喃着「唉，來了罷！唉，來了罷！」這時，我的兩眼立刻看淸楚了，不久以前被西捕追而打死的賣菜女趙留家里了。而且我更看淸楚。這些買不起照會，而又不能不在虎口求生的可憐的少女們，每人每日都有這秩慘死的可能。　　上海婦女社辦的少女會，正在洋大人們的公園里講究少女的健康問題，要少女們注重運動和游泳，我想那些溫室里的少女們的健美身體，該不會像這些過着耗子生活的少女一樣，是用來逃脫帝國主義者們的爪牙的吧？媽媽的日子  英子　　他，孩子的爸，他頂討厭小孩子，當孩子生下來，他就準備把她送到育嬰堂去，我不肯，在這樣險惡的社會中，一個女孩被丟棄了，將來的命運是多麽的可怕呵，我寗肯丟到黃浦江里去，也不願她將來受人的凌辱和痛苦，只要生活免强能活下去，一個母親誰願意將自己的兒女丟棄呢；他時常說：你要她幹嗎？我們還年輕以後還怕沒有孩子麽，我養不活，我不能為着你和孩子做牛馬，斷送自己，出賣自己，一個人該為事業打算，為了生活，為了我們的幸福，只有把她送掉，每當孩子哭的時候，他就咕嚕咕嚕的說了這大篇。　　「哭是他的言語，你難道不許他哭嗎？小孩子總沒有不哭的……」　　我討厭哭，我養不活，要送掉她，總不犯罪吧！你看明天我就送到育嬰堂去，你不許吵，你愛我就得聽我的話……」他用嚴厲的目光視着找，好像審判官在候一個犯人的回答似的。　　「好；隨你辦吧，請你安息吧！不要鬧了，明天的課很多」我忍着滿肚子的氣回答了他，　　第二天九點鐘的左右，他眞把孩子送到育嬰堂去了，孩子被抱走後，我哭了，哭得很悲傷的，從來我是不會哭不流淚的人，這回的淚，就比春雨還多呢？經朋友們的設法，花了四塊錢的手續費，孩子仍然抱回來了，我是多麽的高興呵！當孩子沒有抱回來之前，我的心總是拍拍地跳着，總怕被別人抱走了，我自巳也不加道，看什麼孩子一生下來，和母親就有着一種不可毀減的情感，我覺得母愛是頂純潔，頂直摯的，在我沒有做母親之前，我是沒有感到母愛有這樣的偉大，以前看到許多孩子對自已的母親很凶惡，我心裏想這樣的兒子，怎麽不殺死他呢？到現在才知道一個母親，沒有不痛愛自已的兒女，無論兒女是怎樣的壞對她凶惡，她都會諒解的，仍然要疼愛的呵！　　母親，我遠隔河山的母親喲當抱着您的外孫的時候，就會想到您從前養育我們姊妹的情形，很難過，我很慚愧，母親：您已經老了，巳經走上白髮蓬鬆的暮年了，還時常掛念着你遠地飄流的女兒，她對你有什麽安慰呢？　　五月廿三日　　幾天來心裏非常煩惱，孩子吵，哭我心裏更難過，恨不

<p>電信特刊電界之聲近來電政組織上之重大改革  德　　我國電政組織上之最缺大點，厥為（一）業務不統一，（二）工務不統一。關於電報業務問題，幸經我當局秉勇往直前之精神，埋頭苦幹，始克將各地局台，依次合併，並於本年四月起將靑島，濟南，厦門，萬縣，福州，烟台，長沙等局台有無綫電報房，實行遷併一處工作，不特管理便捷，抑目增進傳遞速率。至於電話業務問題，以前各省長途電話，由各該綫話務管理員一例如濟靑，京滬，等長途電話話務管理員）負責管轄，嗣又改稱為各省長途電話管理員，直至本年四月份，始將長涂，電話管理局，併入電政管理局，仍以原任管理員，管轄長途話務事宜，自茲全區報話業務，均歸管理局統一指揮。其有裨於電信業務之進展，自不待言，此為我國電政組織重大改革之一。　　次之，關於工務問題：查長途電話業務，雖歸管理局轄管，但幹支綫路之修養維持事項，仍由幹綫工務處與管理局工務課，分別負責，不但工務長與工務主任之職權，難於劃分，卽在組織上，亦不免有重牀疊屋之弊。現交通部毅然將各幹綫工務處，一律歸併管理局，所有職務，完全歸管理局工務課負責辦理。並規定自本年七月一日起實行。從此以後，無論幹綫，務，支綫工務，均歸管理局統一節制，事權旣經集中，經費又復撙節，此為我電政組織重大改革之二。　　更有進者，最近吳縣鎭江兩地報話局，均已實行合併，語號重要性，實不亞於以上二項改革、記者希望我當局繼續貫澈其主張，將各地話局與報局，依次合併，俾得發揮行政上之最高效率。金法郎與國際電報的關係  雲城　　中國各處與外國往來的電報，稱為國際電報。這種電報的收費和種種處理手續，須照全世界七十餘國共同訂立的國際電信公約及該公約附屬的電報規則辦理。該公約第三十二條載明國際電報價目，應用金法郎為貨幣本位。所謂金佛郎者，係一種假定之貨幣，共重量為一格蘭姆之三十一分之十，含金之成分為千分之九百。照此計算，其價値約等於法國現在實際適用法郎之五倍。在本年一月中旬金價未跌以前，法國法郎一枚，約値我國銀元二角，所以金法郎一枚約值我國銀元一元。共後金價漸落，法國法朗之價値自銀元二角，低至一角九分，一角八分……所有金法郎之債値，亦隨之而减為銀元九角四分，九角……。　　從上面說來，我們曉得國際電報的價目，係以金法郎為本位，而不是以國幣銀元為本位，這是國際電報與國內電報大大不同的地方，也就是國際電報收費昻貴的理由。舉一個實例來說罷，從中國發到英國一張電報，在民國十九年春季每字價目為金佛郎三法郎七十五生丁（一决郎等於一百生丁），而今年春季的價目為金法郎三法郎四十五生丁，比當年低廉金法郎三十生丁。但是民國十九年春季的金佛郎價値為國幣五角，所以三法郎七十五生丁，僅合國幣一元八角七分五釐，而今年春季的金佛郎價値為國幣一元，所以三法郎四十五生丁，須合國幣二元四角五分，比十九年春季反而高出一元五角七分五釐。發往其他各國電報的情形，也莫不如此。總之近年以來，我國發往外國電報的價目，交通部雖然竭力設法减低，而因為金價及匯兌關係，發報人的負担反而較前增加，眞是一性無可奈何的事。　　自今年一月以來，銀價日高，金價日低。此事對於我國整個工商業及金融界之利害，雖然是另一問題，但是至少限度，金法朗的價値，是隨之低落了。在今年開始的時候，一金法郎的價値，尙是國幣一元，到了三月一日便减為九角五分，而最近自六月一日起復减為八角七分，所以國際電報的費用，在半年之中，不啻减低了百分之十三。這一點在交通部及全國拍發國際電報的公衆，是表示歡迎的。因為在國際電報發報人一方面，其報費的負担可以减輕，而在交通部一方面，國際電報每字所收的電費，雖然减低，但將來業務，可希望更加發達。以後如果金價繼續低落，那末國際電報的價目，還可以减低哩！白銀問題與電政  浩　　自美國提高銀價以來，中美匯價變動之劇烈，實為空前所未有。因之銀價暴漲，白銀外溢，形成目前金融極度恐慌之慘象。揆厥近因，固由於美國之提高銀價，而追溯癥結，實應歸咎於歷年以來國際貿易失其平衡所致。此觀於經濟專家馬寅初氏最近所著「對自銀問題意見」一文，可以槪見。馬氏之言曰：「欲保國內現銀，惟有使國際貿易得其平衡，解决入超。蓋入超銀為現流外之根本原因，阻止現銀外流，當循此根本原因設法，此已成為舉國一致之意見。故言及中國之銀問題，結論必由銀問題轉入於國外貿易問題。」馬氏所言，精闢簡當，减少入超，增加輸出，實為阻止白銀外流之唯一方法，亦卽根本解救吾國經濟恐慌之唯一要圓。　　吾人在電言電，深覺每年白銀外流之由於購置電信機料與發寄國際電報報費兩項者，為數亦殊可觀。電信創辦迄今，逾五十稔，所需一切主要材料，至今猶未能設廠自製，仍須仰給於外人。據調查所知，採辦此項機料費用，在交部方面，年約五百萬元，其他擴充材料尙不在內，如再將各省所用電信機料合併計之，其數彌足驚人。至國際電報報費，因以前吾國對外通信，並無自辦自主機關，所有發往國外各處之各種電報，皆假手水綫公司傳遞，故全國國際電報報費一項。每年落於外人之手者約八百萬元，五十年來，殆不下四萬萬元，此兩筆鉅大支出，無非大好白銀，吾人坐視其汨汨外流，一去不返，寗不痛心！　　雖然，五電信界同人對於各項電信機料之製造，非不能也，實力有未逮也，良以創辦電信機料工廠，需欵至鉅。以過去電信帳面收入數字觀之，辦理此事，似輕而易舉，徒以此項數字，久欠不付之軍官電報費佔其大半，遠者不必論，卽自國民政府成立後之全國各軍政機關所積欠各地電局之軍官電費計之，截至二十三年年底止，巳達二二，一〇六，五一〇、〇九〇五元之鉅。電政經濟，受此打擊，電信機料設廠自製之計劃，焉能見著實行！遂致自給自足主義，迄無達到之望，白銀外流，永無盡期。謂為軍官電欠費，間接造成電信方面白銀外流之因，不為過詞。至於國際雷報報費，自交部於十八年間創立國際大電台之後，漏巵已逐漸挽回。今載以來，該台內部設備迭經擴充改善，直達電路，亦同時增加，故營業狀况，年有進展，最近該台每月報費收入，已超過四十萬元。換言之，即外流之白銀，可以每年减少五百萬元。　　白銀外流之弊害如何，已有嚴重顯明的事實，呈現於吾人之眼簾。吾人遭受痛苦，眞已水深火熱。懲前瑟後，惟有上下一致，從各方面竭力講求阻止白銀外流之道而已。丁此時會，吾人謹掬誠指陳其願望兩事：第一，吾電政當局與電界同人誠有志於謀電信機料之自給自足，惟因困於經濟，無力舉辦，而經濟困難之最大原因，則由於軍官電費之積欠不付，夫軍官電費較之整筆軍餉政費，猶如滄海一粟，為數極微，佐君已於本刊第三十七期「今後之川黔電政」一文中剴切言之，探望吾賢明之軍政當局體念電政艱危，勉力淸付報費，則今後之電信機料，始有自製之可能，且國際風雲，變幻莫測，一旦大戰爆發，材料來源斷絕，整個電信交通，勢必無法維持，斯於國防前途，影饗實鉅。故為國防交通着想，亦應早為之謀。而謀之之道，在於充實電政經濟，而充實之方，在於軍官電費之淸付。第二，國際電報報費，雖已挽回月約四十萬元之數，但全國每月整筆國際電報報費，為數約自八十萬元乃至九十萬元，吾國際電台已經挽回者，不過其一半，尙有一半至今仍為外人所得。深盼吾愛國人士怵於白銀外流所施於吾人之痛苦，深自猛省，今後拍發國際電報，一致指定由迅速準難經濟三美俱備之無綫電路傳遞，庶幾保全國寳，克盡國民之天職也！敬告修築公路當局  驊　　請予維護電報桿綫　　有綫電信之傳遞，必須賴導體之媒介，始能由此端到達彼端，故導體中任何一部份發生障碍，必致電流不通，通信阻滯，維護之道，在於通力合作而已。夫裝置在戶內之機械接綫，其維謎修繕，固屬甚易。至若轟立於嚝野中之架空桿綫，則以距離過長，防護維艱，交部對於桿綫之維護，向盡其最大之努力，以免人為的及天然的種種侵害。如呈准行政院訂定保謎國有報話桿綫規則，以防匪盜破壞；取締在電綫附近施放風箏，以免電路絞搭。派工請拭隔電子塵挨，以免綫路漏電。凡管轄綫路之電局，並須於每晨舉行測騐，藉悉綫路疾病之所在，知所預防。如萬一發生障碍，則立卽派工修復，務使通信阻滯之時問，减少至最低限度。　　顧交部此種努力，苟任何關係之一方不與之合作，仍屬無濟於事。年來各地電信桿綫時遭築路工人之無故損壤，卽其一例。　　吾人熟知：開闢公路，大抵限期甚促，為求施工之迅速起見，遇有森岩石，常縱火焚燒，或用火藥轟炸。沿途電信桿綫，遂不免受池魚之殃。加之修築公路工人，大抵臨時募集，未經訓練，對於沿途桿綫，自不知加以維謎，施工之際，往往無故損壤，認為常事，苟於事前有充分之準備，似不難設法解除。蓋查勘公路路綫之時，如計及沿途電信桿綫可受之影響，立可設法遷讓，築路工人如於事前稍加訓誡，亦不致無故損壞，妨碍通信，此在公路當局之力行如何？問題固極為簡單也。　　夫電信與公路，均屬有關國防。其關係之密切，有如唇齒之相依。設公路而無電信設備，則一切工稈進行及長途行車，將感受莫大困難。電信桿綫而無公路之輔助，則查勘巡修，均屬維艱。交部對於各省公路建設，向極贊助。如與全國經濟委員會訂有西蘭公路電話合作辦法。規定該路長途汽車專營機關使用長途電話時，得照普通减半付費。並為便利長途汽車在中途發生障碍或臨時急要事故之通話，凡車上帶有臨時電話機者，得在中途掛鈎搭綫與隣近車站通話。更為便利工程隊拍發電報起見，特指派報務員携帶電報電話機器及應用材料，隨往工程隊駐在地點設立臨時報房。凡此種種，俱為交部贊助公路建設之事實的表現。吾人深信全國公路當局，俱為開發國內交通為職志，對於電信桿綫之維護必具有相同之觀感，如能予以切實有效的合作，以解除以往交部可遭受之困難，是則電政之幸，抑亦記者所盼望者也。高空中之神秘電子潮汐  十郎　　哈佛大學地理探險社研沒員史德生博士，（Dr.　Harlan　T.Stetson）現正研究離地二百哩高空中一種神秘之雷于潮汐，此種潮汐，顯由月球所致，對於無綫電發射，頗有影響，該項研究，業已得有顯著之結果。據史博士稱，證以詩家谷波期頓等處間無綫電傳射之實騐，此種影響，巳甚明顯。依測騐之分折，當夜月低於水平綫時，則所收無綫電波甚强，當月上昇至天空為吾人所見時，則無綫電發射不佳。史博士又謂據研究所得，上項影響，每月中因各時間之不同而異，蓋視月之臨近北半球或南半球為準。就吾人所得之無綫電收音强度綫觀之，極足使人發生一種感想，覺遠離平地上之伊洪化空氣中，確有一種潮汐作用存在也。　　史氏曾曾海洋中為太陰吸引而起之潮汐，與空中電子潮汐之漲落相比擬。並謂月球何以能使伊洪化之空氣層中，發生足以影響無綫電收昔之潮汐，現時尙難臆斷。雖據無綫電報務員稱月臨時之月光，常有損於無綫電之優良收音，但依吾人觀察此種變化之强弱，實由於月球在天空之位置，而非因其射光之大小也。倘吾人懸出以月球為一荷電體，具有興地球於異之電差，或假定月球亦為一種神奇之發射體，能發射一種類似無綫電活動鎔岩（Radio-active）所發之加嗎光，（lave　gamma　kays）則吾人可得一假設，以推測上述神奇伊洪潮汐之來原矣。津濟話綫施工時之種種  履冰　　五月六日完成　　十日日開放通話　　聯絡平津濟靑　　話音傳送淸晰　　交通部所辦之津濟長途電話，於本年二月初旬開工，五月六日完成，業於十一日起，開放公用，冀魯兩省民衆，莫不稱便。查北平至天津，濟南至靑島，均已早設長途話綫，惟中間藉以聯絡津濟者，在未施工前，祇有鐵綫一對，作為傳話之用。此一對鐵綫，除直達外，尙須供中間各地通話，故時時感受不敷應用之困難，且津濟間電桿，豎立已逾二十載，綫條又多，自難免時起障礙，為澈底整理起見，並為民衆便利通話着想，因先架設銅綫一對，另立新路，將報綫移併，且亦預留地位，俾便不久之將來，擴充話綫之用。計自籌備以迄完成，為時不過數月也。　　津濟自通話以來，民衆利用極便，通話次數，日有增加，其情形已見報載，茲不復贅，祇將施工時之種種拉雜述之：　　津濟設綫，於去歲秋間，開始測量，所定新設桿綫之路，乃沿津浦鐵路之西，與路局電桿，成東西對峙。除避去車站及各種建築將須距賴略遠外，通常沿軌之距離，以六十呎為度。　　測量困難之點，一在天津郊外，數十里問，全屬墳墓，十饅頭彌望皆是，於是擇定立桿之地位，時常感覺困難。津濟話綫，施行交叉，交叉點之距離，均有一定，苟此交叉點適測在墳墓之上，勢須設法避免重測，而墳墓之規模較大者，其後人往往惑於風水之說，拒絕在墳之左右前後立桿，處處發生交涉，時時苦口勸導，實使施工人員，倍感麻煩。其次則在濟南市內，因綫路須跨越津浦及膠濟兩路站臺，站臺長而且廣，路軌縱橫，燈話綫林立，鐵甲車隊，亦駐在該處，擇定路綫，興車輛之往來有關，且亦須車隊之允許通過，屢經接洽後，始無困難。　　津濟綫路，計經鐵路橋梁三處：卽濼口之黃河橋，禹北之徒駭河僑，及近黃河涯之趙王河橋是；而黃河橋尤長，兩岸間相距四千餘呎，得路局同意，裝置鐵架，上安木擔，並髹成與橋柱同樣之色，與路方之架，左右相對，宛如兩翼，頗見美觀。　　本屆施工，分為南北兩段，組織二隊，由技術人員指揮監工。北段由天津而南，南段由濟南而北，開工之始，時在二月，積雪未融，地尙成凍，因此掘穴立桿，不無費力，而報綫須先併架百餘里，亦屬糜時，其後天時轉和，專設銅綫，工程進行，南北合計，日可十餘里，大有長驅直入之勢，至南北兩段，過合之點，則在連鎭站旁。　　連鎭居南北段中點，而連鎭之連」，不啻暗示津濟話綫之在此連絡，斯亦巧也。五月六日之晨南北段技術人員，集合於站旁之分綫桿，試騐通話。分呼濟南及天津，如鄉斯應，於是兩綫接通，成為津濟直達，五分鐘後，詢問津濟，均謂話音極淸晰，嗣後由天津濟南電話管理人員，分頭與靑島北平及其餘通話之處試騐，亦屬晤對不啻一室。此為津濟最初通話之時，南北段工隊，卽在程旁留影，以資紀念。　　津濟話綫之完成，自開工以迄竣工，為時不滿三月，工隊前進，不能不謂為迅速。斯由本年北方天時晴明，雨量甚少，雖時起大風，塵沙蔽天，然對於設綫進行，影響尙不甚鉅。至於此次興工，沿途軍警，隨時保謎，所經縣府，派警照料，而津浦各站，關於臨時置放材料，及斫伐樹枝等事，均熱誠協助，使工之前進，極少阻礙，斯實令工隊感謝者也。值得注意的收報地名問題  葆眞　　發報人將電報交給電局去拍發後，總希望該電能迅速送達收報人，但是有時因為收報地名發生疑問，電局往返查詢，不免被中途轉報局耽延。甚至因為收報局名誤會，竟將發致甲地之電報，拍至地名相同之另一地方，以致該電無法投遞，祇能通知原發報局，向發報人查詢淸楚後，再行更正重拍。如此轉輾查詢，該電勢必遭受耽延。究竟收報地名何以會發生雷同了，姑舉數例以證明之。　　查我國電報局名向係沿用舊稱，如常州，蘇州，重慶，西安之類，以致與現行行政區域名稱不符。交通部曾於上年十一月間查明各地電局局名與現行行政區域名稱及郵政局名不符者，一律飭令更正。例如常州改為武進，蘇州改為吳縣，重慶改為巴縣，西安改為長安等等。又有地名完全相同，而並不隸屬同一省區者，例如「太平」，一在安徽，一在廣西，又如「長安」，一在浙江，一在陝西。此外，還有羅馬字拚音完全相同之地名，如河北覇縣及四川巴縣，其羅馬字拚音均為Pahsien江西樟樹及江蘇常熟均拚為Changshu，浙江嵊縣，河南鄭應，及甘肅成縣均拚為Csenghsien。電局雖經規定對於羅馬字拚音完全相同之局名，均應加註簡拚省名，以示區別。惟發報人大都不很明瞭此項加註簡拚省名辦法，尤其是外僑或洋商拍發洋文電報。往返詢問，不免耗費時間，延誤電報速率。希望發報人對於收報地名，除了特別著名之大都市以外，最好於收報地名後，用括弧註明省別。例如長安（浙江），覇縣（河北），或Chenghsien　（Honan），Taiping（Anhwei），發報人祗須一舉手之勞，卽可避免錯誤。　　其次，說到乙種郵轉電報，往往因送報之郵局及其最近電局名稱錯誤，以致發生不能送妥或投遞延誤情事。綜其原因，不外（甲）第十三版郵政局所彙編內所刋最近電局名稱，不盡可靠：（乙）郵電局名彙編過於陳舊：（丙）最近數年內設裁之電報局處為數甚多；（丁）各省建築公路復交通便利，情形變更。例如甲地電局原離乙地郵局最近。現因自乙地至丙地已通行長途汽車，交通比較便利迅速，而丙地亦已設有電局。故遇有發寄乙地之郵轉電報自應改拍丙地地局交郵轉遞，以資迅速。交通部為補救上項缺點及减少錯誤起見，業經令飭各局轉知各收報員，嗣後對於乙種郵轉電報應照下開辦法辦理；　　（一）如發報人交發之乙種郵轉電雜，將收報地名書為丙地乙地，雖與第十三版郵政局所彙編所列之電局郵局名稱（假定為甲地乙地）不符，但丙地確巳設有電局，且距離乙地郵局甚近，收報員應即按照發報人所書收報地名收下後交報房照發，不必更改。如丙地並無電局，仍應查明距離最近之電局名稱，代為更正後，再行拍發，以免貽誤。　　（二）如發報人交發之乙種郵轉電報所列收報地名為中地乙地，與第十三版郵政局所彙編所列者相符。又經甲地電局查明該電，應由丙地電局交郵遞寄，更為近便時，甲地電局，除將該電立卽轉拍丙地電局交郵轉遞，以資迅捷外，應卽函知原發報局將該電之收報地名，改為丙地乙地。　　同時電局方面希望拍發乙種郵轉電報之人士，如確悉送報之郵局及美最近電局名稱，不妨對收報員詳細說明，以免誤會。一面電局可根據事實，將郵電局名彙編，加以校訂，以期正確完備。　　再說發寄有車站而無電局地方之鐵路經轉電報，其收報車站站名之後，最好亦須註明鐵路名稱，以便電局隨時於收報車站站名之後，加註簡拚路名。例如符離集應拚為Publichitpry方可不至誤交他處經轉。　　總之，收報地名，關係電報傳遞投送之迅速穩妥，極為重要，確有値得吾人之注意也。再告裝置收音機者  佑　　凡欲裝設廣播無綫電收音機者，無論其係購置或自行配成者，均應向交通部，或交通部國際電信局，或交通部所指定之登記處登記。塡具登記聲請書，領取登記證後方准使用。按交通部所頒佈之廣播無綫電收音機登記暫行辦法第二所規定，凡裝置收音機者，均有遵守該項辦法將收音機登記之義務，無須繳納登記費用。如果不經此項手續，則一經查出，須按照電條例第五條及第二十一條之規定，處以五元以上二百元以下之罰金。此項辦法，施行以來，業經數載。其間迭經交通當局廣為宣傳指導，故民衆之裝設收音機者漸多。惟亦有經當地電信機關之一再勸吿，而頑執不登記者。觀乎最近崇明立大祥綢緞莊所設三燈收音機未請登記被處罰金事伴，深旣其弁髦法令，不識事體，致引起糾紛而遭受不必要之處分也！　　先是，崇明無綫電亳經人密報，謂立大祥號內設有收報機一架，請為查辦，經該臺馳往調查，始知係收音機。遂勸令照章登記，渠該商頑執不從，崇臺為維持法令威信計，於是依法處理，送由當地公安局予以五元罰金之處分。此事原極簡單，該商如在當初設置收音機時，照章登記，决不致發生上述事實。卽使事後有人妄吿，崇毫祇須覆按登記證，便可證明。乃該商事前旣未照章登記，事後經崇臺勸告，仍複頑執不從，輕視法令，莫此為甚，至崇臺在依法處理之前，尙勸令履行登記手續，具見其寬待該商之苦心，辦理不謂不當也十　　夫廣播無綫電收音機之管理，各國均制有條例，人民之裝收音機者，莫不信守法令，照章登記，目繳納相當費用，深足表示其為有組織有秩序之國家。獨吾國則不然，人民對於國家法令往往漠視，卽以收音機一事覘之，大足證明國人法律觀念之薄弱。據調查所知，國內裝有收音機者，約數十萬戶，而遵令聲請登記者則殊寥寥，此數十萬收音機裝戶，大抵為生活較裕之智識階級，而竟亦弁髦法令若斯，是誠吾國民缺乏公民訓練之表現，民族前途之隱憂，社會秩序之不易安定，有由來焉！深望各裝戶自今以後，引立大祥事件為殷鑒，迅速向當地交通部電報局或無綫電臺自動登記，母再因循泄沓，致干法律之制裁，而自貽伊戚也！關於中日水綫無綫電報之統計  記者　　中日水綫電報與無綫電報字數之比例，約十分之一，已如上期「中日無綫電路成立周年紀念」文中所述。惟中日水綫分靑佐，川淡，日本滬崎，大北滬崎四綫竄路，除靑佐綫，係中日合辦，川淡綫係傳遞華南與台灣報務，與日本國無大關係外，日本滬崎綫係日本電務局所辦，大北滬崎綫，係大北公司所辦。其水綫報費，屬於靑佐綫者，歸中日兩國均平攤分。屬於日本滬崎者，歸日本所得。屬於大北滬崎者，歸大北公司所得。故中日無綫電路之開放對於靑佐綫，無經濟價値之可言。自可不論而對於日本滬崎與大北滬崎總共字數之比例，約三分之一，卽我國國際無綫電路對於中日報務之加增十二分之一也。試觀下表可以知之矣。　　中日無綫電與日本大北滬崎水綫字數表（二十三年六月起十二月止）　　月份　中日無綫電去報來報　日本滬崎去報來報　大北滬崎去報來報　　六月　二四、四八二　　二四、五一五　六四、四五○　五四、九○一　三四、三二九　四八、五○○　　七月　二二、五五七　二一、○一四　五五、四三二　五七、○四○　三五、七五二　三九、九二二　　八月　二二、三二五　一○、五○八　五八、六四七　五六、○一九　三一、八四七　四○、六九六　　九月　二四、一八八　三○、五三六　六二、二四二　五八、七八二　三一、二○一　三五、一九五　　十月　二八、二○六　二四、八三五　六四、四四九　五九、九六三　三六、一三九　三九、七五二　　十一月　二六、二六二　二三、七○五　五六、四○三　五五、五七○　二九、八八四　三四、三四七　　十二月　二八、○一六　二五、三六七　五五、四七○　五五、二三三　三○、五○六　三三、○八五世界電信發明家小傳  健　　十三，卡本股（Jules　Carpentier）　　卡本脫氏，法國無綫電專家也。一八五四年生於巴黎，一八七一年入工業專門學校肄業，一八七六年任里昻鐵路公司儲藏總工程師，從事研究電氣工程一。氏以電學上之發明於一八八一年得Chevalier大勳章，卡氏為法國先進無綫電專家，曾創辦（Compagnie　GeneraleRadiotelegrathique）,旋爲CompagnieGenerale　de　Telegraphie　Sans　Fil，羅致。氏係科學院之會員並歷任各種科學研究會之主席。　　十四，赫茲（Heinrich　Rudolph　Hetz,）　　赫茲氏，一八五七年生，一八九四年沒，德國之物理學家也，以發明電磁波著名，氏測知凡由一種簡單之工具曰振擺器者之火花所發生之電磁波，均可由一迴綫圈或四方形綫圈曰共振器者以檢收之，並示明電波之反射折射繞射及磁格等特性。此等偉大之發現，皆證實無綫電報之可能性。氏於眞空管亦頗多有價値之試騐。</p>

<p>申報業餘周刊業餘漫譚識字運動與中文拉丁化  佑輔　　中國有着百分之八十的文盲，不用說這是一個關係民族存亡的生死問題。特別在國難日深的今日，這個問題是越來越嚴重了。中國人要生存下去，就要全靠大家的智力，因此怎樣把文字交給一切人，使大家憑了文字能獲得必需的知識來共同挽救這民族的危機這一個問題，是值得我們用最大的關心來討論，並給以正當的解决的。　　最近上海市正積極進行識字運動，履行强制的敎育，準備在最短期中肅淸文盲。這是着實可喜的現象。我們希望這個運動能够很快地得到成功，好把目，前少數人獨佔的文字交還給大衆。而且，如果各地都能照上海的辦法，施行起識字運動來的話，不是文盲的掃除可以很快的完成了嗎？　　但是，為求這個運動獲得切實的，我們所希望的効果起見，除了下令各社團設立識字學校，廣收學生之外，我們不可漠視目前中國文字的改造運動。中國象形漢字的艱難，和不適於現代人的使用，它必需加以合理的科學的改革，這已是大家公認的事實了。所以中文的改造運動應該和識字運動相輔而行，這才能收掃除文盲之效。這兩者正如烏之兩翼，車之兩輪，缺一不成的。　　自去年以來，中國文字的改造問題，已引起各方的深切注意，並且還被提出了許多改革的主張，如手頭字的推行，別字的討論，敎育部的制定簡字，以及中國語書法拉丁化的提倡等等。其中尤以拉丁化的主張最値得我們的注意。拉丁化企圖把象形漢字改造成拚音文字，把艱難落後的文字改造成簡易合理的文字。中國文字的改革，無疑應該向拚音化這條路走的，這是自然的趨勢。　　漢字需要一塊塊地去記，眞是麻煩透頂的事，而拉丁化祇要認得二十幾個字母及十餘條書寫規則，就誰都可以看書作文了，這其間的難易是非常明白的。與其花費許多時間和精力在漢字的學習上，自然還不如把多餘的時間用在別的工作上，更來得有意義。拉丁化實行以後，就能節省許多人的無數的時間和精力來做其他有意義的社會的文化的工作了。　　拉丁化是應該得到更多人的注意，應該得到更高的評價的。靠了它才能解决中國的文字改造問題，才能掃除中國的文盲，使一切人都有讀書作文的機會。我們相信，目前正在急速推行的識字運動，如能採用拉丁化，把識字運動和拉丁化運動合流起來，一定能獲得比用漢字要大十倍幾十倍的效果，這是可以斷言的。科學業話現實天國  鶴　　宗敎家覺得我們這個塵土世界的地球，乃是最痛苦最齷齪的一個罪惡世界，所以他們爲我們想出一個天國，這天國在宇宙中要算是最幸福最快樂的世界。但是，近代科學發達的結果，凡稍有常識的人，都知道他們所想出來的天國是假的。雖然如此，但字宙中不是就沒有了天國，若科學地研究起來，眞正的幸福世界，而且是現實的並非空想的樂園與天國，恐怕就要算我們自己所住的地球罷。　　不錯，在廣大的字宙中，我們現時尙不能斷定別的星球就完全沒有適宜於繁殖生物的，不能斷定就沒有有生物的星球存在，但無論如何，就現今所能確知的一切星球而言，恐怕只能肯定地說地球才是最適宜於生物生存的一個世界罷。至少在太陽系諸星球中，可以斷言地球是最適宜於生物生存的一個處所。歷史上曾有過不少的科學家和思想家，都懷疑着金星與火星上有生物和人類存在，他們在觀察天體時，發現了金星的黑暗部分有光的斑點，而且是變化的，於是就懷疑這光點是由於那上面有居民，他們在每半世紀有一次大的聖節，燃着巨大的火，把光傳送到我們地球上來。大數學家高斯，他相信火星上有人類居住，並提議依畢達哥爾的三角形定理，在隱秘的森林中的麥田裏，畫些大的幾何圖形，讓火星上的人看見，作為彼此通信的公共語言。因為他以為這是純目然法則的記號，如果別的星球上的人同我們一樣聰明，他們當然也會懂得這一幾何定理，而回答我們的消息。當然，還有主張用顏色變換作為通信記號的，更有主張用光的變換作為試探消息的方法的，這裏不過略舉一例罷了。但是，不管用什麽方法，結果總沒有半點消息從那些星球上回達過來，眞令人掃興！　　太陽系諸行星誰是最適宜於生物生存的，這問題不能憑空懸想，應該根據科學原理去說明。這些科學原理，在天文學中已經吿訴了我們一部分，現在我們根據這些原理來看各大行星中誰才配得上成為生物的樂園罷。　　最近太陽的一個行星是水星，水星的自轉和繞太陽的公轉都是八十八日，他的一天就是一年。如此，則水星向太陽的一面是永遠向太陽，而背太陽的一面也永遠背太陽，所以在向太陽的一面熱度永在沸點以上，球面恐怕都會鎔解，如何會有生物呢？反之，在背太陽的一面則永在冰點下二三百度，也是不宜有生物的。加之生物不但必須賴有水，而且大氣也要有相當的密度，才能使生物生存，然而由水星掠過太陽時僅現黑點而不生光圈看來，知道它縱有大氣也很稀薄，所以雖由其呈現蒸氣粗黑綫足徵其大氣中有水，但仍不適宜於有生物的。其次是金星，金星的表面很糢糊，為雲霧所蔽，因此其反射日光率大於水星四倍，亦大於月球三倍，可知其空氣充足，或宜於有生物。但金星雖無表面標記可以確定測知其自轉週期如何，而許多天文學家却曾依種種方法計算，得有可靠的蹬據，證明其自轉和公轉亦具有水星的同樣形態，一面永久向日而他面永久背日。此說雖未敢作為定論，然亦缺乏可以决定其有生物的確定反證。再次為火星，天文家觀察火星表面所得的印象，謂火星上縱橫的條紋甚多，形長且細，斯恰帕勒稱之為運河，其兩極的白色頂蓋，陸彗爾認為係冰雪所成，入春融化流向赤道平原，不但條紋增闊，並且使其兩岸的綠色部增大，此綠色部份卽為植物，而條紋確似人工鑿成的運河。因此，火星上似有生物，如有生物則其人類必達到很高的進化程度，因為火星比地球尤小，其冷縮較早進化較快的緣故。但火星上很少見雲霧，卽有亦只偶爾間事，可知其大氣必甚為稀薄，溫度亦甚低，成為生物存在的絕大障礙，故其眞有生物人類與否，仍難斷定。更次為木星與土星，這兩顆行星情形大約相同，其表面雲霧水汽甚濃，顯現為蒸騰現象，特別是士星，是一個旋轉甚速的沸騰的金屬體質，流水不能凝聚，體熱甚高，皆不宜有生物。至於天王星，海王星，據天文學家推測，其熱度恐亦很高，不能有生物，論到地球的衛星月球，雖亦有人謂其有生物，如下等植物之類，但月球表面無空氣，已由其不起散折日光的作用，流星撞面無空氣傳聲，無磨擦閃爍之光等等事實得着證明。月球旣無空氣則已不能令生物生存，而且因無大氣折散和含蓄熱量，故可斷定其面太陽時溫度永在沸點之上，其背太陽時則永在冰點以下，生物亦絕難生存的。　　太陽系諸行星中，地球是特殊地適宜於生物生存的家屋。因在總的進化過程中，地球是正達到地殼凝固冷縮，便於繁殖生物的階段，並且它所具備的許多物理條件，都是適宜於生物生存的。地球的自轉速度，雖然在原始時代很快，可是到現今的階段，其和它的公轉相配合，恰使它的全表面都能普遍地經過向日與背日的變化，而且大體上大部分的地方都是半日向日半日背日，這就使它有吸收太陽的熱與放射其所吸收的熱的可能，而調劑其溫度不至過高亦不至過低。空氣層的存在，這是對於生物生存的必要條件，因為不但動物要借空氣中的氧氣而生活，就是植物也要借日光來行氧化作用，以遂其生長。而且地球在共冷縮過程中，存在得有大氣圈包圍它的外表，這氣圈中達到一定的時期，便形成充足的輕氧炭等等重要原質，生物才能賴以成立和生存。不但如此，大</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>氣的作用是調節地球上的氣候使之達於適當程度的重要條件。因為地球表面若無大氣，則對日時由於日光强烈而無空氣吸收和折散與反射等等，必令地面溫度高於沸點，甚至使地殼鎔化，生物如何能生存呢？反之，在背日時大地吸收之熱無空氣保障含蓄，完全迅速地放射無餘，則地面溫度立刻降到冰點以下，達到凍結酷寒的境地，生物也是不能存在的。當然，大地上的水和水汽的存在，也是同樣重要的。永的氣化液化等等變化，不但有吸收執量和放射熱量等等調劑溫度的作用，而且它有溶解物質的能力，其流動性亦具輸送物質使之互相接近的作用，因而才能造成地面衆多的化合物。生物的成立固然要靠它，卽其成立後的營養作用也要靠它。植物無水則死，動物亦要備水的溶解輸送能力，才能消化食物，將其養分送達於全身。空氣，水分的作用於生物如此其大，然而地球却都把它們具備得有，所以地球成為最滴宜於生物生存且有人類的一個星體。訓練與修養生命力  辰　　「人是一架機械，一架由水分的壓力，化學的綜合，伊洪，加魯列，反射動作，反腱骨等物組織成的機械。」這是對於二十世紀的人所下的定義。那末，人果眞是一架機械嗎？　　無疑地，人是自然界的物質之一。人是物質。但是，自從電子論發明後，物質的槪念已與前不同了。丁淘兒（Tyndall）與赫胥黎（Huxley）的物質觀是靜止的，不滅的，但新物理學中的物質觀是活動的，可滅的。物質是電子的「向外表現力」（Externality）底「勢能」（Energy），這種「勢能」是活動的，存在於有機體和無機體中。電子一與電接觸Charge）卽使原子分解離散，就後分子發生變化，再就後極微極微地使物質特性變更，消滅。故我們稱這活動和可滅為「物質的進化」與「物質的生命。」—「我們可以看出現在的物理學家和化學家皆在生物學的觀念之後暗中摸索；生物學的槪念向全宇宙擴充領土。」（見Ha）aana的機械，生命與人）這就是唯生主義。人是有生命力的，並不是機械。　　人旣有了生命力，那末，我們要不要持續它呢？我回答說要的。現在一般敏感的傷感的人所以厭惡生命，是有相當的理由的。因為他所處的世界是充滿了世紀末的病態：機械的呌囂，肉慾的放縱，藝術‘的頹廢，一切意志和自由的憧憬都被衝到黑暗層裏。結果，安神藥和避孕丹的銷路大旺。安神藥結束了「現在生命之維持」；避孕丹結束了「將來生命之延續」。這是人類的道德嗎？　　其實，人的生命格是二重的：第一為小我之維持，為二為大我之延續。這種持績關係是等量的：倘使不謀小我之維持，則沒有延績大我的可能性；倘使不謀大我之延續，則沒有維持小我的必要性。為什麼要小我之維持呢？因為先决條伴是達爾文主義（適者生存）。為什麽要大我之延績呢？因為先决條件是克魯泡特金主義（互助）。所以一個人應當持績他的生命力，為了小我之優生和大我之長生。有了這種人我同存的態度，我們應當偉大地運用着我們的生命力。　　人旣要持續生命力，那末，我們用什麽方法呢？現在且先申述維持小我的方法。　　照唯生哲學家的見解是「求食」。他們以為求食可攝取外來的生元，來推動自己的舊生元，來增加生存能力。我以為「健康」比「求食」重要。為什麽呢？我門且舉一個例來說明。　　這裏是一個孱弱的靑年，文縐縐的，手無縛雞之力，面色黃如蠟紙，在他面前放着一席佳餚，犬魚肥肉盛滿了一桌。但是，他的脾胃却不允許這些食物裝進去。他看着別人的狼吞虎嚥，微微地嘆口氣。那裏是一個精神飽滿的健康的靑年，在他面前放着一席靑菜，蘿匐乾和鹹黃魚。但是，他因為消化力很强，在前一點鐘玩了籃球，他的胃正空着，於是迅速地吃了四碗飯，愉快地吃完，又愉快地走到空地上去晒太陽了。　　健康的人不在乎食物的豐美：但孱弱的人就是有了豐美的食物也只好望洋興嘆。　　那未，健康到底能不能維持生命力呢？我說能的。健康是「正型性格」的特徵。有了健康，你能不覺痛苦地去工作，你能抵抗各種病菌，你受人欺時可興他决鬥而且克勝，你能得到美麗的妻子，你可以掮鎗到前方……一切快樂之源都從此而來。這樣，你决不會去買安神藥了，你小我的生命力的維持是成功了。　　倘使你因生理上或種缺陷而變了「負型性格」，那末，趕快脫了長褂子走到戶外去。別看別人跳啦，跑啦，擲啦，你自己參加去。攀山，競走，騎馬，游水，網球，拉力，那眞多得算不淸。或許受了生理上缺陷的刺載，你有超越的成功也說不定，祇要你肯努力。　　「物不用則朽，」我們快把肌肉活動活動，有了活動，我們便有了新的生元，生力，生機。　　但是，有了健康，有了小我維持的能力，就足够了嗎？我說不够，還有大我的延績這一層呢？它的方法，我以為是「智識」。　　倘使祇，有健康而無智識，那末，必將如慄悍的非洲人、其延續的運命一定很舛乖，而且遭人的揶揄。張飛式的勇而無謀或許不適合於我們這時代了。我們翻開歷史來一看，覺得我們所以能够延績至今，確是我們視先對智識上的努力。到了十八世紀以後，我們的智識是絕大地廣播着，尤其是關於科學的那方面。每一根水汀管的裝置，每架機器中的精細的零件，足使中世紀的帝王昨舌不下。在空中，在地面，在地底，在海面，在海底，都是智識的血。為什麽要這樣呢？這無非為了要使大我不斷的向光明一方面延績。給後代一種幸福是我們的道德。我們以健康遺傳給兒子，把智識應用到未來的社會，是善的倫理。　　記得愛迪生這樣說：「科學的必然趨勢是衛生。」喂！軍火科學家聽着吧！人類始終是兄弟，有理智的，愛和平的。我們應該發明怎樣使人類藉着科學的能力增加生力，保衛着生力，並且友誼地達到人類的烏託邦。　　健康的人們，當你從運動場回來，休息一下之後，可走到你的實騐室或書室，用功的無偏心的從事於衛生學，醫學的研究工作，做着一種不需人力的機械，或者寫些樂譜，詩歌，新宗敎，新政治理想。我們的時代期待着這種偉大的工作，偉大的知識。　　知識卽是道德，智識卽是權力。有智識的人不會去買避孕丹，因為他顧慮着他的後代。有智識的人才覺到他的偉大，因為他供給社會上的需求。惟獨智識，方能延績大我。　　人的生命力是向上的，我們應當持績它。有了健康，他會知道人生的快樂。‘有了智識，他會知道為什麽要發揮生存能力。近代的工廠，倘使略加佈置，不是就是家庭？寂靜的電氣動力，每個齒輪自己不差分毫的動着，就後帶出一大批產品。我們除了管理外，不必再動筋肉了。　　倘使你悲觀的話，往運動場裏一跑，他還給你愉快地歸來。我們不必一天到晚躱在小屋子裏，在白紙上寫着名詞動詞和形容詞，一天運動二點鐘，便可獲得二年的資料。　　生命的大敵是時間，但萬物都是過程，你應該為後代着想。你到了老年，見到你的後代是接受了你的心血，你便可吻吻他們的額說：「上帝，我巳盡責了！」於是你笑着瞑目。　　一對健康的夫妻，手推着孩車，太陽在他們前而，他倆討論着智識，更看看他們的肥胖的後代。啊，這綠草地七的三個影子，你們便是生命力的標識！業餘咖啡座畢業如出嫁  易人　　現在學校將放暑假，又有一大批的學生快要畢業了！因為我也曾經有過「畢業」那一回事，所以我知道畢業到底是怎樣的一種滋味。我的經騐吿訴我：畢業如出嫁。而且我們現在的出嫁還不是自由的戀愛，愛情的結合，一夫一妻的小家庭：而是舊式的婚姻，嫁到暮氣很深的舊家庭中去，上有思想陳腐的為姑，中有性情不很溫和的丈夫，下有搬嘴弄舌刻薄善妒的小姑。以一個向未離開過母親，撒嬌慣的，毫無處世經騐的小姑娘，一旦要去應付這多方面的環境，自然是非常艱難和困苦的。參考資料北方話拉丁化方案  原芙　　（一）北方話拉丁化方案中，一共有二十八個字母。用了這些字母，就可以寫出北方人的一切說話來。這二十八個字母是一A（啊）　B（不）C（此）Cb（痴）D得）　E（厄）F（夫）G（革）　J（意）　J（意）　K（克）　L（勒）M（沒）N（納）NgO（哦）　P（潑）R（而）Rb（日）S（四）Sb（是）T（脫）U（（烏）W（烏）X（黑）　Y（雨）Z（子）Zh（知）　　zh（知）　ch（痴）　sh（是）rh（日）四音，南方話裏沒有，南方人學時要特別注意ong的發音，詳見第四條。j,w跟i,u音同，理由見第十條。　　（二）二十八個字母中，a，e，i，o，u,y六個是母音，此外都是子音　　（三）北方話中有十五個複雜母音一ai（愛）　&gt;ao（襖）　，ei（允諾聲），ie（也），ra（呀），iao　（要），iou（有），iu（汕），ou（歐），ua（「挖」），uai（「外」），ui（「位」），uo（「我」），ye（日），yo（藥）。　　（四）北方話中有十五個帶鼻音（n或ng）的母音一、an（安），ang（盎），en（思），eng（鞥），in（因），ing（英），ian（烟），iang（牟），uan（「彎」），uang（「王」），un（「文」），ung（「翁」），yan（原）yn（雲），yng（用）。in和ing，en和eng很難辨別，寫時可以不必嚴格區別，此外幾組，如an和ang等等的分別是很明白的，不可混同。　　（五）g（革）k（克）x（黑）在母音i前面時，讀作一gi（幾），ki（欺），xi（希），在母音y前面時，讀作—gy（居）　，ky（區）　，　xy（許）。　　（六）子音和母音拚合起來就是音叚，此方b和a拚起來便是ba　，這ba便是一個音叚。好幾個音　凑起來就成詞兒，比方把兩個ba凑起來便是baba（爸爸），這baba便是一個詞兒。又如atinxua（拉丁化）這個詞兒，是由la,tin,xua三個音假構成的。　　（七）音叚通常雖然用子音和母音拚合而成，但是母音却可以單獨做音叚，比方xiay（下雨）的y便是個音叚oz,c,s,r/zh,ch,sh,rh這八個子音也能單獨做音叚，例如：zs（自私），，cr（詞兒）　，　zbsh（知識），rhz（日子），chfan（吃飯）。　　（八）表示一個完整概的詞兒，不問它有幾個音叚，都得連着寫。比方「無論如何」要寫作ulunrhuxo决不可寫作u　lun　rhuxo。　　（九）詞兒的結尾（詞尾）要跟詞兒連着寫，比方「皮球兒」（pikur），孩子們中」（xaizmn），「屋子裏」（uzli），「我的哥哥的書」（wodi　gogodi　shu），「來了」　（lailiao）「做不成」（zobucheng）等的「兒」，「們」，「裏」，「的」，「了」，「不成」，者要跟前面的詞兒連着寫。　　（十）兩個鄰接的音叚，發音易起混同時，就可用（，）這個符號，或者用jw，w這兩固字母來界開。這呌做界音法。比方「皮襖」寫作pi,ao（而piao乃是「飄」）「夜裏」寫作leli而「半夜」則寫作banje（i變為j，否則有人要念作banic）「因為」寫作inwei而「原因」要寫作yanjin加了個　，否則怕有人要讀作y-a-nin）。「務必」寫作ubi,而「義務」要寫作iwu（加了固w，否則怕有人運讀作iu由」去了）。　（十一）數目字的寫法，要照單，十，百，千，萬…的位數分開，比方「一萬二千三百四十五」，就寫作iwan　rcian　sanbai　sshu。　　（十二）表示次序的數目字，以及表示不確定的數目的時候，用短劃隔開。比方：「第一次」寫作di-ic；「四五天」寫作s-utian。　　（十三）對於常用的幾個同音的詞兒，要用母昔的重疊來區別，比方：「那兒」（nar）「哪兒」（naar）?gigo（幾固），giigo（幾個）？「賣」（mai），「買」（maai）　：「山西」（Shansi）「陝西」（Shaansi）：「他」（ta），taa（她）；「栗子」（liz），「李子」（lijz）。　　　（十四）成語可以連起來寫，而有些可分開的就在中間用短劃隔開。比方「總而言之」（zungrjanzh），「豈有此理」（kijoucli）；「時時刻刻」（shsh-keke），「無綠無故」（uyan-ugu）。　　（十五）過到國名，地名，人名等專門名詞的時候，這些詞兒的開頭第一個字母要大寫。比方「中國」（Zhungguo），「日本」（Rhben）,「上海」（Shangxai），「柏林」（Berlin），「托爾斯泰」（Tolstoj），「孔子」（Kungz）。　　（十六）每一句句子的卯頭第一個字母也要大寫，比方一　　Yanlai　taa　gang　shengxial　aidishxou,　t

<p>以往，從學校中嫁到社會去的學生，約可分為三類：第一類人，一嫁到社會，卽放棄了自己在學校時的理想，也消失了自己在學校時的勇氣。她彷彿世故很深的樣子，她會和不善良的丈夫同流合汚，也會和頑固冷酷的翁姑一鼻孔出氣。第二類人，一嫁到社會，什麽都看不慣，覺得這新的生活與自己的預料全然相反，然而她只是煩悶自苦，結果不是自毀，終至被毀。衆二類人，她在未到社會以前，已經胸有成竹，早已透視了丈夫家庭中的一切。她挾策以去，抱征服舊家庭駕馭丈夫的决心，有計劃有步驟的使丈夫不至壓迫自己，翁姑雖未能立時變革其舊態度，然假以時日，或不難因賢能媳婦的感化開導，而漸見開明。這三類人中，第一種人和第二種人我人可以名之曰腐化分子，第三種人則方可稱為新時代的新人物！　　　然而這一第三種人」也並不容易做之我們只要看「桃李刦」那一影片中的建平就可知道。建平不是泠有完成「人道」「正義」的夢嗎？建平的失敗，是可以表示出在這傳統社會中，一尺的「人道」，一寸的「正義」，還抵抗不了十丈一的魔高！　　一個人如果要過糜爛的生活或享樂的生活，那是非常容易的，只要你能妥協，能隨波逐流。如果你還想為人類留一點正義，為歷史創一份永久的產業，那就需要挺起胸膛，睜出眼珠，正視現實，分析現實，放開脚步去硬幹苦幹了！　　「今天是桃李芬芳，明天是社會棟樑」，我也這樣恭祝那些快要出嫁到社會的學生諾君。海外通訊網模特兒  鷗　　東京通訊　　商業愈是發達，廣吿術也就愈跟着進步。在從前沒有新聞紙發行的時期，一般商店為了要招徠主顧，或是要報吿新到貨品的消息，便祗得印行一種傳單式的廣吿僱人到處散發，或者是到各街衢的牆壁上張貼巨大的海報，廣吿技術可以說是簡單極了。後來有了新聞紙的發行和廣吿學的傳播，一般商人的頭腦也靈活起來，於是，我們便常常可以在報上看到長篇巨幅的廣吿刊佈出來。此後，廣告學的運用，其範圍愈來愈廣，方式也愈出愈奇；從利用「傳單，」海報，」報紙做廣吿，以至於現在馬路上，影戲院，火車，輪船，茶樓，酒館等處都成了運用廣吿學最好的塲所，廣吿術之隨商業而發達的情形，由此也就可以想見一斑了。不過，這上面所說的許多廣吿方式的運用，在歐洲和日本的商業上，似乎巳經有點感到陳舊，認為還不能十分收到廣吿上的效果，而不為一般大腹賈所歡迎，於是我這裏所要說的「模特兒」活動廣吿便出現了。　　「模特兒」廣吿在日本出現還是在昭和三年十一月「御大典」的時候，東京市有一家「丸菱吳服店」僱用了七位妙齡的女郎，穿着很時髦的時裝，像「蠟人」般的站在櫥窗裏，供給往來於街衢的羣衆飽餐一次眼福。果然，這種嶄新的廣吿方式採用了以後，「丸菱吳服店」做衣服的主顧便一天比一天多了起來；不用說，這一種活動廣吿在「生意眼」上是得到了相當的成功了。「模特兒」在廣吿士的價値，便為一般「着先鞭」的大腹賈所認識了，並且還認為是一種最富有刺激性的宣傳工具；於是，由吳服店而擴展到百貨公司，鞋店，以及化妝品公司，都拚命的倣效起來。從此，在日本婦女職業範疇內，又多了一條新的職業路徑了。　　這時，東京便有一家「丸之內美容院」的院主，呌山野千枝子女土，一眼看上了這種穩賺錢的職業，自然是不肯輕輕放過機會，因此在昭和四年間，便在「精養軒」創立一個「模特兒」的供給機關，名呌一日本模特兒俱樂部」，她便成為日本「模特兒」機關創辦人的開山鼻祖，自己還祖任了這俱樂部的部長。「模特兒」這項職業，經她來了這樣一種有機構的組織，從此便在日本形成了正式的女子職業之一；一般商店和百貨公司在需要「模特兒」做廣吿時，就祗須通知她這俱樂部一下，便立時可以辦到，不必再像以前那樣的，要僱用「模特兒」時還得想許多方法去找了。這俱樂部給與了各商店很多的便利，牠的營業之日趨於發達自不必說；不過往後因為商店需要這種活動廣告的一天比一天增多，一個供應機關常時感覺到治下的「模特兒一不够支配；由是，出現於東京市的「模特兒」供應機關，便像雨後春筍般很迅速的發達起來了。現在這種機關究竟有多少家，還沒有確實的統計，不過據我所知道的是有「銀座，」「雙葉，」「東京，」「不二，」和「淺草」六家。它們的組織情形和介紹的手績，大概和國內「荐頭行」沒有多大的差別；不過它們「取材」的嚴格，却不是國內的「荐頭行」所能比擬的。　　一個想做「模特兒」的女子，至少是要具備這幾種條件：一，容貌要長得嫵媚；二，身長要有五尺三寸左右：三，學識要有中學程度，思想要豐富，口齒要伶俐；四，性情要溫柔，態度要活潑大方；五，年齡要在十七歲至二十五歲之間；還要有健美的體格和舞蹈的技能。　　不過在這經濟不景氣的現狀下，要這種人材做「模特兒」自然還是嫌她太多；我們在東京所看到的「模特兒」，簡直可以說沒有一個不是畏得秀外慧中的。不過，這許多漂亮時髦的女子肯來充當「模特兒」的原因，一面自然是因了社會經濟的衰落，不容易找到出路；一面却也因為「模特兒」報酬所得，的確比一般的女子職業要豐富得多。一個「校特兒一的收入，在最初新興的時期，以每天工作八小時計，平均每天約可得二十元；但到了現在，因為從事此項職業的人太多了，所以報酬所入，也就比往日大大的打了一個折扣，平均每矢不過五元，半天三元，每月大概不過百多元。另外還有許多商店一年到頭都在用「模特兒」做廣吿宣傳，對於她們的待遇大都採用月給制；每月薪水的高下，就要看她的面貌，和曲線美長的怎樣而給予適當的數目，普通的標準，大槪每月都在五十元左右。還有一種到美術學校充當「模特見」的女子，她們所得的報酬大半要比商店裏的「模特兒」豐富一點；普通每天可有八元的收入，半天五元。不過做這種「模特兒」的工作却是簡單而無味；一般潔身自好的良家女子，誰也不願脫掉衣褲，坐在那裏像偶像般供人描繪的。所以做這種「模特兒」的女子，大都是賣淫的出身，甚至還有些女子一面在秘密賣淫，一面在空下來的時間裏就出來找點「外快。」如果是專門靠做「模特兒」過活的，那她們每天的工作就很緊張了，差不多從早到晚都在各學校裏幹着那種脫衣裳的勾當，一個學校的工作完了下來，又到另外一個學校裏去，彷彿和別種職業婦女上寫字間一樣的忙碌。　　在商場中充當「模特兒」最要緊的本領，是要有吸引顧主的魔力，能够推銷貨品，才能得到大腹賈的另眼相着和豐富的報酬。最近在東京商業上最活躍的「模特兒」，恐怕要算山田歌子一人了。她的面貌的秀麗，自是不用說，而且她那一種應付顧王的手腕，的確能使人一見銷魂，不得不去趁貿東西的機會和她親近。所以她無論走到那一家商店或者百貨公司，總有許多顧客就像做了她的隨員般的，跟着她的行踪所至，跑來跑去的在她手裏買一兩樣東西；甚至她所宣傳的東西，在你並不一定合用，你也會因了是她在宣傳，好像被磁石吸了去般的非買不可。因此，她的聲名大盛，身價也跟着高了；愈是迄樣，那願意被她吸引的顧客也就愈多。她有一天在「松屋吳服店」裏做「模特兒」，竟替它招攬到一百二十疋的棉布生意；在「佐佐木」化妝店，也推銷到五百元的化妝品，這在東京的「模特兒」界中，簡直可以說是奇蹟。因此，一般大腹賈為了推廣自己的貨品的銷路，大家好像都不顧死活的，拚命拿着最高的代價請她來做廣吿宣傳，而她每月的收入也就在這許多大老板的搶奪下，像寒暑表裏的水銀般的升高到出乎人們意想之外了。據說她做一天「模特兒」大槪可有四十元至五十元的代價，有時還不止這點。別的「模特兒」不一定天天都有人雇用，可是她却例外的一個月沒有一天空閒的時間，甚至有時要她做「模特兒」還要在前一兩天預定，由她排定日子，不然，也許當你正要她來工作，而她卻回答你一個沒有空呢。　　用「模特兒」做廣吿，在日本可詮是正在發展時期，尤其在東京要算是特別發達。在最初做「模特兒」的女子現在差不多都脫離這種生活下野了；可是後一輩的又補上了這個陣綫，繼續的在開拓這一新的女子職業的路途。因此，在東京　看到的僱用「模特兒」的商店，也比以前更加多了起來；甚至先期在報紙上大登廣告，報告用「模特兒」的消息來吸引顧客。在這點上，一方面固然是由於廣吿術的進步，但另一方面因商業下景氣而造成了這樣競爭的局面，也是無可諱言的事實！雜作「水滸傳」所表現的戀愛觀（下）  少問　　同時，「水滸傳」也描寫了兩個戀愛故事：一個是武松嫂嫂潘金蓮與西門慶戀愛，另一個則是楊雄的老婆潘巧雲　戀和尙裴如海。在描寫潘金蓮與西門慶的戀愛中，「水滸傳」的作者首先就告訴我們，潘金蓮原來是一個大戶人家的使女，嫁與武松哥哥武大為妻後，什麽都沒有問題，只是「愛偷漢子」。接着便是西門慶在一個偶然的機會得見了潘金蓮，經過了王婆的大說「風情」之後，他們便火一般的相戀了；後來甚至設計謀害武大，把他用藥鴆死了。但故事的結局，乃是武松登塲，他很沉着地把西門慶，潘金蓮與王婆一齊殺了，當着衆人祭奠他的哥哥武大。單就這個故事來看，也顯然是反對西門慶與潘金蓮的戀愛的；作者對於這故事的描寫）那更是抱着封建的戀愛觀念去對付的。由此所表現出來的潘金連不消說是一個淫蕩的女人，書中甚至稱她為「淫婦」；西門慶也是被描畫成為一個仗勢欺人的惡棍；王婆則是被小丑化了的貪鄙的媒婆；此外如武大，乃是表現成為一個忠厚的好人的；武松當然更是被作者描寫成為一個英勇可愛的人物了。——這樣，無論在故事的構成上，無論在作者的描寫的態度上，「水滸」中的潘金蓮與西門慶的戀愛的事情，都是這到了無情的攻擊，無情的否定的。至於潘巧雲之愛裴如海的事情，在「水滸」中也是如潘金速與西門慶的戀愛一樣，被毒罵被攻繫了的；潘巧　　以下接第五版</p>
<p>Page 25</p>
<p>雲興裴如海的命運，也與潘金蓮和西門慶的相同，是被殺害了的：在這裏出現的好漢是拚命三郎石秀，他是楊雄的結拜兄弟，其英勇氣慨，差不多可以說並不在武松之下。這樣，潘巧雲之愛和尙裴如海，和西門慶與潘金蓮的戀愛，在「水滸」中雖是兩件事情，但其所表現的思想却是一樣的：封建的地主農民的戀愛觀。　　此外，在「水滸」的最後，由於宋江吳用玩弄邪術，在石碣上出現了三十六天罡與七十二地煞的名字。如果就武藝來說，一丈靑扈三娘應列於天罡星之內，但事實上却把她放在七十二地煞中並將其名列於王英的之後了。這個原因，不消說是在她是矮脚虎王英的老婆一事上：王英無能，旣然歸入七十二地煞中了，依封建的定規，女人是隨夫賤隨夫貴的，所以一丈靑雖有本領，但因其是王英的老婆，便也不得不歸在七十二地煞之內並將其名列於王英的之下了。——所謂「重男輕女」的封建觀念於此可謂表現得非常十足！　　由於上面那些實際的分析，說「水滸」所表現的戀愛觀是禁慾主義，是地主農民的封建的戀愛觀，這想來是不會有什麼原則上的問題吧。（完）播音節目蘇曲新書　　楊知了「太平花」　　中西（〇四〇）上午十一時至三刻　　第一回　割鷄留客田舍夜談兵　　李守白夢中驚醒，披衣出見，見韓樂餘亦忽忽出來，三人計議同往莊前探聽消息，行至關王廟門前，衛兵以為間諜將守白拖人營部，韓樂餘見守白被逮，驚惶失措，喚老奴奔回家中，適小梅自閨中出來，見老奴趕回報信，驚魂無主，呆若木鷄，韓樂餘亦垂頭喪氣，踱回家中。特別節目　　晨鐘口琴隊　　華東（一三六〇）下午一時至一時半　　梅花一弄（二重奏）（秦泰來戴松泉）樁姬（特編拔粹曲）（李厚襄）珂伯伽行進曲（葛朝祉）希伯來月下（劉逸）沙爾登行進曲（陳惠康）卡爾王行進曲（三重奏）（李厚襄劉逸葛朝祉）　　大衆口琴會　　華東（一三六〇）下午一時半至二時　　口琴獨奏（德國大軍進行曲）（石人望）半音口琴合奏（甜夢圓舞曲）（葛朝祉高濬生）口琴二重奏（普天同慶）（石人望李厚襄）口琴叫部奏（熊的跳舞）（大衆會員）半音口琴獨奏（探戈舞曲）（德國口琴唱片）口琴隊合奏（都會進行曲）（大衆口琴隊）手風琴鋼琴口琴隊大合奏（探羅林進行曲）（大衆口琴隊全體）　　都會社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午二時至三時　　嫁給勇士吧（靜韻）和平歌（若蘭）妹妹我怪你（珍妮）農村之歌（孫曼）永別了弟弟（笙韻）春宵曲（虹瑛）我的愛人就是你（蕙姚綉韻）　　愛克隊　　大中華（一一六〇）下午三時至四時　　近乎我至（店志翔）三潭印月（二重奏）（黃興王志龍）美之菊城（郭錫洪）奮起救國（趙斌）阿根廷美女（二重奏）（王典·文華）小桃紅（丁新華）美國巡邏兵（王志龍）小弓圓舞曲（文華）長想思（周壽石）愛之古巢（文華）回憶巴黎（黃興）紅薔薇（周欽德）特別消息　　子夜樂會本星期日晚八至九時應李樹德堂電台之請播送特別節目，（一）還我河山，（二）我當初認識你，（三）離別了姑娘，（四）病中友，（五）縫窮婆，（六）雁兒太可憐，（七）路柳牆花，（八）孤樓憶昔八闋，除首尾二闋係全體國樂合奏，餘均請歌唱名媛江曼莉。汪澹澹、余靜分唱，並聞該會發刊之週歌第六期「回憶慈母曲」第七期「縫窮　」已出版云。華興電台（週率一二六〇）本星期日（十六日）上午九時至十時播送國畫演講特別節目一小時，主講者乃富春山人，聞富春山人在國畫界久負盛各，所畫稿件，尤稱儘貴，不久將開展覽會於西藏路寗波同鄉會，此次能得答允將歷年心得演播於無綫電中，實屬創舉，希諸愛好者能按時收聽也。　　上海「藝草社友社」自徵求社友以來，各祖均人才濟濟，現口零，話劇二組為整頓起見，故停止播音一月，又該社因文藝組同志尤多，為便利共同研究及提高興趣之宗旨，特每星期日於播音日報出版「雜草文藝」週刊，由吳雄劍，夏中漢編輯，聞本星期日出版第三期，歡迎各文藝同志賜敎，附郵一分，奉最近一期，如加入合作，社章備索，函索兩郵半分寄本埠城內西倉橋街華興里力十三號該社云。電影消息「慾海遺恨」將公映　　現在的電影，巳經趨於吏寫實的一途，所取題材，完全是「寫實主義」。但，以性病血為電影的，卻是未之前見。美國哥倫比亞影片公司，自從宣佈製片計劃，力趨第一流以來，所出各片，都有相當的號召能力，過去的，巳斑斑可考，母待贅言。而它的新片一慾海遺恨一，尤其是　齣獨特之作。　　「慾海遺恨」是世界銀壇上一種新的發現，以性病為題材，寫都市病底　性」的危險性。以一對靑年男女，代表都市民衆的一羣，演來曲折沉着，透切緊張，殊給予一般靑年有力的　惕。該片在美國紐約開映時，以內容關係，男女觀衆，分日招待，而絕對禁止十六歲以下之兒童參觀，即其內容之為都市民衆所不可不看，不能不看者，蓋可知矣。該片現已由新光大戲院取得在漱首次開映權，不日即可公開放映云。慾海遺恨的一幕卡爾勃烈蓀新作品「同心曲」將公映　　凡是看過「歌衫血痕」和「風流皇帝」的朋友，對於那主角卡爾勃烈蓀的歌喉和舞技，大槪都有着很深的印象吧。現在，他的新作品「同心曲「Two　Hearts　In　Waltz　Time」據說已經運滬，在最近的將來，又將與滬上影迷行相見禮了。這部片子，完全是利用「音」和「影」的權威，再拿藝術的手腕，把它發展到銀慕上去，使你混身沉浸在歡樂中，在一部九千餘尺的膠片上，自始至終，敢說找不出一尺令人厭倦的畫面來，卡爾勃烈蓀。更把他所有的技藝，一齊貫輸到這作品裏去，你不但可以看見他細膩的表情，聽見他悅耳的歌聲，並且還有機會欣賞他的新奇舞術，如果就勃烈蓀個人的成續說，實在比「風流皇帝」好得多了，致於劇情的曲折別緻，更為此片生色不少，諸位等着瞧吧。新刋介紹　　漫廬圖書公司出版之「電影漫畫」第三期今日出版，封面為叫色版，豔麗無比，內容計名貴照像百餘幅，漫畫五十餘幅，並增三色版，取材編排印刷裝幀，俱球上乘，每册二角。　　陳嘉震金燄任光安娥主編之「藝聲電影音樂」月刊，創刊號亦於今日出版，除特攝名貴照片外，並有胡蝶，陣燕燕，高占非夫婦等文字，及胡老江棟良萬古蟾之漫畫，每册二角。　　電聲四卷二十叫期及攝影畫報十一卷十七期均已出版，索閱附郵角五分寄南京路五十四號三和出版社，當即寄奉一册。　　千秋出版社春色半月刊十二期革新號出版，每冊八分，預定全年二元，另贈蔣芷芬女士書繪扇面，可加上欵，進直接向卡　路一五三弄四號本社為限。</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Toho News, the British government is paying close attention to the actions of the Japanese army in North China, believing it is inappropriate to stand idly by.

The matter of a large squadron of Japanese planes coming to Beiping for reconnaissance has been called off.

<p>— Ang</p>
<p>Since Stalin abandoned the policy of promoting world revolution in 1927, the entire Soviet Union has devoted itself to economic construction. This was a major turning point in the Soviet Union's national destiny and a crucial turning point in international politics. Today, the Soviet Union, both in Europe and Asia, is in a position of great importance, which is evident to all. Leaving aside the situation in the Far East for the moment, in Europe, British Lord Privy Seal Eden and French Foreign Minister Laval have successively visited Moscow. Czech Foreign Minister Beneš has recently completed his mission to Russia, and Romania is following in the footsteps of France and Czechoslovakia, negotiating a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union. This is a sign of Moscow's growing importance alongside Geneva in contemporary European international relations, and a significant stage in the history of the collective peace movement.</p>
<p>The collective security system is a new form of internationalism that emerged after the European War. The role of various countries in this system cannot be generalized. However, its ideal is to be different from the military alliances of confrontation that existed before the war. According to Eden, "The collective security system means that when it is completed, each nation will use its joint power to ensure security for all." Therefore, this new spirit in international relations, if adopted by all countries, will be different from the antagonism and conflict between the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy and the Triple Entente of Britain, France, and Russia before the war.</p>
<p>In its current state, the collective security system is based on the League of Nations. However, the major powers have different expectations of the League of Nations. Even Britain and France, whose foreign policies are based on the League of Nations, have different dreams. Britain sees the League of Nations as a peaceful mechanism for countries to consult and cooperate, ultimately aiming to create a center of world public opinion. France, on the other hand, wants the League of Nations to become a powerful organization for maintaining the status quo. Since the establishment of the League of Nations, Britain's proposals have been dominant. Therefore, the collective security movement has been influenced by the power of Britain and its colonies. For example, the new interpretations of Articles 10 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, and the failure of the 1922 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance and the 1924 Geneva Protocol, were all due to this. In recent times, the international situation has deteriorated, and Britain and France have both felt the urgent need to strengthen the collective security system. Therefore, France, with Britain's support, proposed the conclusion of an Eastern European Pact.</p>
<p>The Eastern European Pact currently planned is intended to combine with the 1926 Locarno Treaties to form the two major pillars of the European collective security system. The already concluded Franco-Russian and Czech-Russian treaties, as well as the upcoming Romanian-Russian treaty, are merely fragments of the entire Eastern European Pact. However, if we compare the 1926 Locarno Treaties with the Franco-Russian and Czech-Russian treaties, the latter is more advanced and powerful than the former. The Locarno Treaties in Western Europe were a compromise reached after the failure of the general security movement at the time. Its core was merely the joint guarantee by France, Germany, Belgium, Britain, and Italy of the 50-kilometer demilitarized zone on the left bank of the Rhine River, which still did not depart from the outline of traditional British policy. The reason why this treaty was so highly praised by various countries at the time and considered a major step forward was simply because it was the beginning of placing the victorious and defeated nations on an equal footing for joint guarantee. The treaty's adherence to Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant regarding military sanctions was clearly stipulated in the accompanying documents, accommodating the traditionally weak interpretation. The current Franco-Russian and Czech-Russian treaties are based entirely on the original spirit of the League of Nations, clearly stipulating the protection of the territories of the contracting states, with military sanctions as a backup. This is tantamount to reviving the dead Articles 10 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Treaties of this nature are currently limited to a corner of Europe. Only when they can be promoted globally can they be considered a success for the collective security system.</p>
<p>Some say that the mutual assistance pacts signed by France, Czechoslovakia, and Russia are essentially forming a chain against Germany. If we still view this with pre-war eyes, this argument has its reasons. Conversely, if we evaluate it with the new spirit of the post-war era, there may be some differences. If we examine the Franco-Russian and Czech-Russian treaties, the final clause of the protocol clearly stipulates that Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states are invited to join together to form the so-called Eastern European Locarno. Whether this provision reflects the true intentions of the contracting states is debatable. However, compared to the Franco-Russian alliance of 1894, which was exclusively aimed at Germany, the difference between rejection and welcome is significant.</p>
<p>From the current situation, the success or failure of the Eastern European Pact depends on Germany's attitude. This is obvious to anyone with intelligence. However, there are still 15 million Teutons living under foreign rule outside Germany's eastern border. With Germany's strength, it will not willingly bind itself. Therefore, the completion of the so-called collective security system, even in Europe, cannot be achieved overnight.</p>

<p>Prague: Local newspapers gladly discussed the sincere reception of Czech Foreign Minister Beneš by the Soviet Union, saying, "This kind of reception is a declaration of loyalty and love from one country to another." The Prague Daily News commented, "Soviet public opinion is a very mature political view, so the invitation to Beneš and the statements made in Moscow are both extremely important." The Sass Test-Slov News commented, "We and the Soviet Union have clearly realized that 'the most effective weapon for guaranteeing peace is the collective security system.' The recent military and regional division advocated by Germany is in direct contrast to this. Beneš's visit to Britain is the most obvious manifestation of the public's demand for peace."</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers expressed lively interest in Beneš's stay in Moscow. The "Nuvelli" newspaper commented, "We must be pleased with the results of this visit, as the firm will of the Czech and Soviet Union continues to work to remove all obstacles on the road to collective security."

(4) When calculating the tonnage held by Germany, obsolete ships should be deducted from British warships, with first-line ships as the standard.

The shipbuilding plan stipulates that the old ships to be scrapped range from battleships to small torpedo boats, and also stipulates a gradual increase in naval personnel. If the plan is finalized, not only will the five ships of the Queen Elizabeth fleet be scrapped, but also 25 cruisers and a large number of destroyers will be dismantled. Ballard also said that the plan cannot be completed in four years. (Fourteenth National Electric)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Anglo-German Naval Issue to be Formally Discussed Today, German Government Accepts British Conditions <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(London) Naval experts from Britain and Germany continued their talks this morning, and the official meeting of the two delegations is scheduled for Monday of next week. It is heard that the German government has accepted the conditions put forward by Britain, so the two delegations are now awaiting replies from France and Italy in order to establish the final agreement between Britain and Germany. As for the United States and Japan, they replied a few days ago. It is also heard that the German chief representative Ribbentrop brought from Berlin a detailed plan for German naval shipbuilding. Experts are now busy studying how to implement this plan in annual installments according to the Anglo-German naval ratio. It is heard that both sides have agreed that it will take at least six or seven years before the German navy can reach the 35% ratio, and this ratio refers not only to the total tonnage of the navy, but also to the various fleets and armaments on warships. (Fifteenth Havvas Electric)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the naval talks, the Daily Telegraph reported that if no unforeseen events occur, Britain and Germany could conclude an agreement in the middle of next week. Germany will be invited to the future naval conference, regardless of whether it attends or not. "This kind of negative attitude is dominated by the concept of prestige, and at the same time there is another reason, that is, Germany is eager to establish a rapprochement with Britain. Once the goal is achieved, the naval conference will no longer have any meaning in Germany's eyes, but the British do not agree with this view." (Fifteenth Havvas Electric)</p>
<p>(London) Naval experts from Britain and Germany met twice at the Admiralty today to discuss the technical aspects of the German naval ratio. It is heard that Britain is deeply afraid that after the completion of the German new fleet, British warships will be obsolete and unsuitable for use, so it advocates that a period of six years must be stipulated for the replacement of British old ships. Regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement, Britain has sent inquiries to various naval countries separately, so that this agreement can obtain the consent of these countries and have a universal nature. The United States and Japan replied a few days ago, and the replies from France and Italy can be expected soon. (Fourteenth Havvas Electric)</p>

<p>(Paris) According to an announcement here today, the Laval cabinet is drafting an austerity plan to protect the franc. The plan will probably be submitted to Parliament next week. (Fourteenth National Electric)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government today issued a serious warning to those who oppose the government's methods of maintaining the franc, saying that Prime Minister Laval will never allow any actions that hinder the government's maintenance of the franc, and that the power given to the government by Parliament is fully capable of dealing with this kind of situation. According to reliable sources, the cabinet will meet next week to pass several important measures, which will then be promulgated in the form of orders. (Fifteenth National Electric)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to "Capital Weekly," the government plans to issue substitute legal decrees authorized by Parliament starting on July 1. These decrees can be divided into the following items: (1) Reduce or cancel certain types of subsidies. (2) Cancel the pensions of veterans currently serving in the military. The above two items can save a total of 1.5 billion francs in government expenses. (3) Cancel secondary railway branch lines and reduce railway personnel, which can save 200 million francs. (4) Gradually eliminate redundant personnel, cancel concurrent positions and certain official expenses, and cancel overtime work bonuses. (5) Abolish certain administrative agencies. The above two items can save 100 million francs. (6) Revise the social insurance system, which can save 55 million francs. The total amount saved will reach 5 billion francs.

<p>(Paris) Recently, there have been many rumors circulating about the government's financial plan. The spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office therefore issued a statement saying, "Those who intend to sabotage the government's efforts to rescue the franc will be severely punished by the government and will not be tolerated. The full power granted to the government by the Senate and House of Representatives is sufficient to stop this kind of opposition to the government." (Fourteenth Havvas Electric)</p>

<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister Tedio is currently conducting a large-scale propaganda campaign against the parliamentary system in words and writing, which has attracted general attention. Tedio gave a public speech at the Academy of Social Sciences, advocating a thorough reform of the political system. However, this kind of reform cannot be initiated by Parliament, but should be initiated by the people. Tedio continued, "The people who elect parliamentarians are now dissatisfied with these people, and they are scolding and cursing them, so they should understand the reasons why the people are so distressed today." Tedio pointed out that only action can save the country, and only a strong government can cope with today's economic difficulties. Therefore, Tedio demanded that France be thoroughly reformed. Although this work cannot be accomplished in a day, it must still be worked towards diligently. (Fifteenth National Electric)</p>

In addition, 3,000 pounds are allocated annually to set up two Chinese language professors and two teaching assistants at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, London, and Manchester. However, the number of British students studying Chinese in Manchester has decreased slightly compared to before, because Lancashire Commercial Bank has temporarily stopped recruiting staff to be sent to the Far East. The Chinese College on Goer Street, which is run by the committee, now has more students and is a gathering place for Chinese students. (Fifteenth Reuters Electric)</p>

<p>Batavia: The Dutch East Indies government plans to levy an export tax on rubber planted by Europeans according to the local market price. The standards are as follows: no export tax is levied when the market price per half kilogram is below 17 cents; when the market price is 17 cents but does not exceed 18 cents, a tax of half a cent is levied per half kilogram; when the market price is 18 cents but does not exceed 20 cents, a tax of one cent is levied per half kilogram; and when the market price exceeds 20 cents, a tax of one-quarter of a cent is levied for every cent increase. The government will allocate a portion of the export tax from rubber planted by natives for public administration expenses. It is found that Dutch Prime Minister Colin has repeatedly expressed his opinion that he wants to increase the revenue from rubber taxes as much as possible when circumstances permit, and the current new tax method is based on the Dutch Prime Minister's opinion.

<p>(Geneva) This morning, during the International Labour Conference, the Chinese representative, Li Pingheng, delivered a speech, emphasizing the necessity of increasing the purchasing power of the people. Mr. Li stated that countries are currently erecting high tariff barriers for their own interests. In reality, world recovery requires international cooperation. The stability of the political situation is also an essential factor in increasing the purchasing power of the people. China has recently encountered many economic crises. Most recently, due to currency issues, it had to increase the silver export tax, leading to increased unemployment. However, on the other hand, it is working hard with the League of Nations to formulate economic plans and reorganize various industries, which are all worth mentioning. China is now focusing on rural revitalization, the establishment of rural banks, and the abolition of miscellaneous taxes, which has slightly delayed the progress of other construction. However, the legislation of various social welfare undertakings is still being vigorously formulated. New laws have been promulgated for cooperative businesses, life insurance, and so on. Finally, Mr. Li also asked the conference to assist the Chinese government in exercising factory inspection rights in concessions. (14th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

The unemployment situation has not improved, and some countries are dumping industrial products in China with similar quality but lower prices, which further exacerbates the unemployment problem. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers have suffered from this dumping policy. The International Labour Office must study the impact of the dumping policy on society, especially on workers. He hoped that Director Butler would visit China to inspect the situation. (14th Havas dispatch)</p>

Therefore, he advocates interracial marriage between whites and blacks. This statement has caused astonishment throughout Germany. However, Professor Gieke, the South African ambassador to Germany, is a famous race scholar and strongly disagrees with this view. He believes Shaw's statement is irresponsible playwright talk, as not only does the South African government have no such intention, but even the white people of South Africa do not want to maintain the purity of the race. He also believes that white people will be able to reproduce and continue in South Africa, and that white culture is European culture, which is a non-negotiable culture. (14th National Telegraph)</p>

After the ceasefire order was issued, the muddy soldiers left their trenches. They have endured three years of bloody battles, resulting in 50,000 deaths and 60,000 injuries. As a result of the war, the financial resources of both Bolivia and Paraguay have been exhausted, and Britain has also suffered, as Britain is the main market for Bolivian metals. Britain and the United States are both major investors in the country. The collapse of the Paraguayan economy directly affects Argentina more than any other country because Argentina is the largest consumer and transporter of Paraguayan exports, and the Argentine currency is closely related to the Paraguayan currency.

<p>Burbank, California Famous American aviator Captain Puchett took off today from here in his Winnie Mae aircraft, which has twice circled the world, flying through the stratosphere to New York. This is his fourth attempt. Wearing a specially designed pressurized suit, Puchett hopes to fly at an altitude of 33,000 feet and reach New York in seven or eight hours, whereas it usually takes eighteen hours. The purpose of this test, like the previous three, is to explore the possibility of using the stratosphere as a regular air transport medium for the world. His first attempt was on February 22nd, but he was forced to land 125 miles from Los Angeles due to a leaking oil pipe. The second attempt was on March 15th, but he was forced to land in Cleveland, Ohio, due to the oxygen supply running low. The third attempt was on April 14th, but he only flew to the Petty University airfield due to mechanical damage en route. If today's attempt is successful, Puchett will be the first person to fly across the North American continent through the stratosphere and will break the air speed record from Los Angeles to New York.

<p>(Nanjing) The Weihaiwei Fisheries Administration asked for clarification on the Fisheries Law. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce explained: (1) Although the Fisheries Law does not restrict people from applying to establish fishing grounds or aquaculture farms on a certain water surface, in order to avoid conflicts and overlaps with other people's fishing rights or prevent a few private individuals from monopolizing fisheries, the administrative authority may consider the local situation and the applicant's economic strength to reduce the area. (2) Fishing rights and mining rights are both regarded as special rights. However, the Mining Law stipulates that mineral rights are subject to the payment of area tax under the Land Tax Law, while the Fisheries Law has no explicit provision for taxation of exclusive water surface use. Moreover, the fish tax and fisheries tax have been explicitly exempted by the National Government, so it is inappropriate to collect taxes in violation of the law. (3) The meaning of Article 18, Paragraph 2 of the Fisheries Law is that private individuals are not allowed to exclusively use a water surface for fishing, so it stipulates that it cannot be approved without the application of the fisheries association. However, although the application is made by the fisheries association, the power of approval still belongs to the competent authority, as clearly stipulated in Paragraph 1 of this article. The statement in the letter that it "may open the door to interference in administration by people's organizations" is a misunderstanding and should be followed. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Special Dispatch from Japan</p>
<p>Due to the global economic recession, heavy taxes, and the unprecedented natural disasters of last year, Japan's rural economy is in extreme distress. Ordinary farmers are finding it difficult to make a living. According to surveys by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Home Affairs, the number of farm households in need of relief in the drought-stricken areas such as Kyushu, Ehime, and Kagawa is 226,181; in the areas affected by crop failures, such as Kagoshima, Miyagi, and Ishikawa, there are 119,941; and in the sericulture areas, such as Yamanashi, Gunma, Nagano, Saitama, Aichi, Mie, Gifu, Shiga, and Shimane, there are 412,926. In total, there are 759,048 households in need. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the government convened a special temporary meeting last year to discuss relief measures. In the regular Diet session this spring, a huge disaster relief budget was approved. In terms of social measures, efforts have been made in recent years to promote rural self-reliance movements. Although these measures cannot fundamentally relieve the rural areas, the trend in the rural economy has shifted towards self-sufficiency, commercialization, industrialization, rationalization, and communization.</p>
<p>The reason why Japanese farmers have become aware of economic exhaustion in recent years is because they have failed to maintain the principle of self-sufficiency and are being exploited by merchants and industrialists. Now, the rural areas are focusing on restoring a self-sufficient lifestyle, promoting self-sufficient handicrafts. In terms of clothing, everyone is using silk and cotton fabrics produced in the rural areas. In terms of food, everyone is using food produced within the village. Even things like wine and soy sauce are brewed by the farmers themselves, no longer relying on the supply of merchants. Regarding fertilizers, which are most relevant to the rural economy, under the leadership of the intellectual class in the rural areas, farmers are manufacturing and supplying them themselves. Just taking this one item as an example, in Gifu Prefecture alone, 3 million yen can be saved annually, because farmers have always purchased fertilizers on credit during the busy farming season, requiring heavy interest payments and passing through two or three commercial institutions. By the time it reaches the farmers, the price is already much higher. However, under the principle of self-sufficiency, there are also some contradictory phenomena, such as rural elementary school students abandoning wooden clogs and switching to rubber shoes. Rural consumers are considering ways to prevent industrialists and merchants from profiting from this situation.</p>
<p>According to the village affairs report of Aobe Village in Shizuoka Prefecture, from the Showa 2nd year to the 5th year, the entire village had to bear a debt of over 40,000 yen each year. Since the 6th year, a self-sufficient economic system has been implemented. All consumer goods, except for those that must be purchased outside the village, are supplied by the people within the village themselves. As a result, not only is there no debt, but there is also an average annual surplus of over 27,540 yen. Since then, many rural areas have followed the example of Aobe Village and are trending towards self-sufficiency. However, today's social life is very complex, and absolute self-sufficiency is impossible. Moreover, the surplus products from self-sufficiency must be transported to cities or other villages. Farmers want to eliminate intermediate retailers and wholesalers and sell directly to consumers, which is trending towards commercialization. However, to implement a self-sufficient production system, it is necessary to industrialize the rural areas, especially during the so-called "emergency times" when soldiers are busy preparing for war. To make the war last forever, it is necessary to first enrich rural industry, so the Ministry of the Army's military budget includes an item for "improving rural industry." The industrialization is most obvious in the rural areas of Nara, Osaka, and Kyoto. Threshing machines, rice milling machines, etc., are everywhere. Other side occupations are also being vigorously promoted.</p>
<p>Another notable trend is the rationalization of rural areas. This rationalization can be divided into three types: rationalization of production, rationalization of private life, and rationalization of public life. The rationalization of production is carried out by agricultural associations formulating regeneration plans and providing detailed guidance on the selection of varieties and the application of machinery. The rationalization of private life involves using empty houses as warehouses, promoting frugal weddings, and saving money. The rationalization of public life includes things like the merging of villages, the reorganization of elementary schools, and the promotion of extracurricular activities. Rural areas throughout Japan are implementing these measures. The fishing and farming villages in Hokkaido have been the most effective. Under the support and guidance of administrative personnel, farmers are implementing joint sales, joint purchases, joint transportation, joint silkworm rearing, joint debt repayment, joint operations, and so on. Many cooperatives have abandoned their business nature and become communized for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>As this new trend in rural economics unfolds, farmers' thinking may also have a tendency to become radical, which is what the Japanese political authorities are most worried about. (June 11th, Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Chinese and German Embassies Decide to Upgrade - The Issue of Relocating the Berlin Embassy <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Berlin Correspondence: The German Reichstag held a general meeting at 8 PM on May 21st. Hitler read out his thirteen major points of foreign policy, which lasted for about two hours. This speech, which was related to the safety of Europe, had no empty seats inside the venue, and the road outside the venue was also filled with onlookers. Even the entire Germany listened attentively through the radio, which aroused such great interest. The diplomatic corps also participated in its entirety that day. The ambassadors of Britain, the United States, Italy, and Japan, as well as the ministers of other countries, stood up one after another to congratulate Liu Chongjie, the Chinese envoy to Germany, which attracted the attention of the audience. The German government has formally announced that it will upgrade its envoy to China to an ambassador, and the Chinese government has replied agreeing and taking the same steps.</p>
<p>The idea of upgrading the ministers of the major powers stationed in China to ambassadors has been around for a long time. Because the Soviet Union was the first to take the lead, Italy followed suit, and Japan is now following suit. European countries, unwilling to lag behind, have a tendency to make a sharp turn. Germany, however, is following Britain's lead, agreeing to act together. Each has its own wonderful purpose. On the afternoon of May 17th, at 6:30 PM, the German Foreign Minister invited our country's Minister Liu to meet and informed him that the German government intended to upgrade its embassy in China to an embassy, ​​hoping that China would take the same steps and solicit consent for the new ambassador, Dr. Trautmann. The next day, Minister Liu informed the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that he had received an order from Nanjing that the Chinese government had decided to upgrade the Berlin legation to an embassy at the same time. On May 21st, Minister Liu visited the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs again and notified that the Chinese government had also replied by telegram agreeing to the new ambassador. The mutual respect between China and Germany has been clearly stated. After the announcement of this news, the local newspapers reported it in great detail. Major newspapers that pay attention to diplomacy have also commented on it. Excerpts from the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt are translated below:</p>
<p>Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung: The news that the German government has decided to upgrade its envoy to China to an ambassador will be welcomed by the majority of people in Germany. Other major countries will also send ambassadors to China at the same time as Germany. An ambassador is different from a minister and is the representative of the head of state. This common step taken by various countries is a proper expression of recognizing the remarkable achievements of the government of the Republic of China in recent years. In a difficult environment in terms of politics and economics, China has worked hard to build, revive everything, and create the Chinese nation, making remarkable progress.</p>
<p>After years of internal political disputes, China has now largely settled down. General Chiang Kai-shek has been working hard to quell the chaos of bandit suppression for more than a year, and has achieved success in recent months. At the same time, although China has been affected by the Manchurian Incident, the global economic panic, and the rise in silver prices, which have hindered its upward development, it has still been able to achieve such results without the financial assistance of foreign countries. Japan also participated in this move by the great powers. We secretly hope that this move by Japan is not only a superficial kindness, but also a starting point for the two countries to eliminate old grievances, which would be fortunate for the peace of the Far East.</p>
<p>Berliner Tageblatt: Italy, Britain, the United States, and Germany have successively upgraded their ministers stationed in China to ambassadors. Britain, the United States, and Germany all announced their decisions on the same day. Italy took the lead in advocating the above decision. Since the Washington Conference and the Nine-Power Treaty in 1930, the countries have mutually agreed that this matter should be acted upon jointly. Italy's actions in this regard were a step ahead and took the lead.</p>
<p>Italy's pioneering move was because Japan was trying to get closer to China and had already upgraded its minister stationed in Peiping to an ambassador in order to promote a friendly atmosphere, but the increasing consolidation of the political power of the Nanjing government also had a lot to do with it. At the same time, the so-called "One China Issue" - that is, how China's future relations with Europe, the United States, and Japan on the one hand will develop - although there is no sudden change, it has gradually reappeared on the stage of "world politics." Under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, the consolidation of the central government's position, as well as the economic development that will be associated with political centralization, and China's unpredictable position in the world political arena, have to some extent had the same effect on Italy and other countries and have become the cause of the upgrading of ministers. The Soviet Union has had an embassy in Peiping since 1924.</p>
<p>The interests of Germany in China and China in Germany are almost entirely economic and cultural in nature. At present, both sides are working hard to manage and develop in these two aspects.</p>
<p>The mutual upgrading of the legations of China and Germany to embassies is a foregone conclusion and does not need to be discussed. However, we cannot help but say that the Chinese legation in Berlin, purchased 30 years ago, is old, small, and indescribable. Formerly, the area was still a residential area, but now it has gradually become a bustling city. The legation is adjacent to shops, which is extremely noisy, and the surrounding area is full of restaurants and dance halls, which is a particularly bad environment. Therefore, the legation is often cramped and uneasy during social events. It is said that after Minister Liu took office, he requested a better location. Now that the legation has been upgraded to an embassy in order to enhance the system, the relocation of the embassy must be an urgent task along with the upgrade.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In early May, Fujian was hit by severe floods. The southwestern districts, Po Wei, and Changting counties, which were most severely flooded, as well as the villages along the Nanjian Mountains, have been completely destroyed, with crops washed away and no food or shelter. The county governments are currently sending personnel to investigate in order to provide relief. The counties of Nanping, Jian'ou, Songxi, and Zhenghe in northern Fujian, upstream of the Min River, have also been experiencing continuous heavy rains, with the river water rising by more than ten feet. The fields and crops along the river have been washed away and numerous houses have collapsed. The county governments have been telegraphing for relief for days. After the flood receded, due to the accumulation of filth and the hot weather, an epidemic broke out, spreading rapidly and causing successive deaths. The provincial government has ordered the Civil Affairs Department's Relief Committee, the New Life Movement Association, and the Doctors' Association to organize a provincial epidemic prevention committee, allocate 5,000 yuan to purchase vaccines and medicines, and send them to various counties to carry out injections and diagnoses. The county New Life Movement Associations have also launched epidemic prevention and hygiene campaigns, urging the people to catch rats and kill flies, and pay attention to clean eating, living, and hygiene in order to eliminate the source of the epidemic. At the same time, it has also ordered the provincial capital's water and land police agencies to establish quarantine teams to inspect ships arriving in the province from upstream at Hongshan Bridge in the West Port and Sanjiadao in the South Port. If there are any patients, they will be sent to isolation hospitals for treatment in order to prevent the epidemic from entering Fuzhou City. The most tragic case is Zhenghe County. After the flood, it was followed by the plague. The people were already in dire straits, but recently, the areas of Shitien, Wanchang, and Huangdun bordering Qingyuan were invaded by the remnant bandits led by Wen Shaoxiang, and the areas of Tungang, Guachang, and Huitien bordering Songxi were also invaded by Huang Ligui's bandits, who looted on a large scale. Liu [unclear] Ding and Zhang [unclear] Ji's troops are currently engaged in joint suppression. In addition, the roadbeds and bridges on the Pucheng to Yanping, Fuzhou to Mawei, Fuzhou to Dehua, Quanzhou to Zhangzhou, and Longyan to Tingzhou highways have also been washed away in many places. The Construction Department ordered the highway engineering office to repair them quickly in order to resume traffic. At the same time, it ordered the water conservancy engineering office to establish four water gauge stations at Yanping City, Youxikou, Shuikouguan, and Minjiangkou along the Min River between Yanping and Fuzhou to predict water levels in order to prevent flooding. However, according to water conservancy experts, although the Min River channel has been dredged below Taijiang in recent years by a special bureau, the water flow has been becoming smoother. However, the reason why flooding is still unavoidable is that the forests in the Min River's upstream watershed have been devastated by the Communist bandits over the years, and almost all have been cut down. As a result, the once lush mountains are now barren. Once heavy rain arrives, there is no obstruction at all, and in an instant, the water flows down in torrents. Although the flow increases, the river width remains the same, and the water level increases sharply, leading to a major disaster. (June 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Shandong's Deceased Coal Miners - The Process of Issuing Pensions - ...Families of Workers Receive With Tears... <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The issue of pensions for the families of the deceased workers in the Luda mine disaster, after donations from various parties and investment by the company, a total of more than 290,000 was raised, and was completely distributed at the Luda current factory office on the 13th. The families of each L[unclear] received the money with tears and dispersed. The details of the process are as follows:</p>
<p>After the Aftermath Committee stipulated that the pensions would be issued on the 12th, in order to ensure that this matter ended smoothly and without obstruction, a general committee was held at the Luda Club on the afternoon of the 12th to discuss a detailed plan. Due to the needs of the situation, four divisions were established to facilitate the process: (1) Supervision Division, responsible personnel are County Magistrate Zhang Yunzao and 64th Brigade Commander Ning Chun. (2) Review Division, responsible for reviewing whether the certificates held by the families of the deceased workers are forged, only then can they be effective in receiving the money. Gao Shoushan, Gu Chi, Zhou Yingdu, Japanese Nakamura, and Ma Yingfu were designated as five responsible personnel. (3) Payment Division, responsible personnel are Rong Zhu Zhong, Japanese Oyama, Wang Zhendong, Li Wencheng, and Meng Junsheng. (4) Security Division, established to prevent irregular behavior by family members at the time, or bad elements disturbing order. Deputy Battalion Commander Liu, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Guojun, Company Commander Zhang (Tianxiang), and Inspector Zhang were responsible. In addition to designating responsible personnel, relevant personnel were verbally invited to assist.</p>
<p>The Aftermath Committee, considering that the deceased family members receiving the pensions might arouse the covetousness of those with ulterior motives and lead to inappropriate thoughts, or even unexpected events affecting public security, has stipulated several measures, ordering them to temporarily store the money. After the meeting, County Magistrate Zhang Yunzao gave a sincere speech to the village chiefs of the related villages at the Luda Company's on-site office, saying that the unprecedented catastrophe that occurred at Luda was not only a misfortune for Luda Company itself, but also a great misfortune for the local people. The aftermath measures have been determined by Chairman Han and Consul General Nishida at the mine to determine the amount of the pension, giving 330 yuan to each person. It has been determined that it will be issued tomorrow. Considering that the family members of the deceased will inevitably arouse the covetousness of villains, leading to theft or robbery, or even endangering their lives, it is of great importance. In order to prevent this from happening, the Aftermath Committee has designated the Third Section of the County Government, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Post Office in the city as places for the family members of the deceased to store the pensions, which can be freely withdrawn afterwards. It is stable and safe, and it is guaranteed to be safe. I hope that you will relay to the family members of the deceased to implement it earnestly. The order of receiving the money for each village was also stipulated. On the 13th, the distribution will first be given to Pingdeng Village (i.e., the South Factory) and Ziyou Village (i.e., the Northeast and Northwest factories), as well as other villages attached to Yi. On the 14th, the distribution will be given to people from other villages who live in Pingdeng and Ziyou villages. On the 15th, the distribution will be given to foreigners who live in Pingdeng and Ziyou villages who have no property here. On the 15th, they are required to leave the country. I hope that you will all be jointly responsible for this incident so that it can be safely completed.</p>
<p>Gu Chi, the Standing Director of the Trade Union, and Wang Guojun, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, were afraid that the village chiefs still did not understand the significance of this, or ignored it and considered it unimportant. Therefore, at 7:00 PM on the 12th, they gathered the village chiefs again to speak at the Trade Union, reiterating the significance of what County Magistrate Zhang said, and stating that if the deceased family members and family members have disputes over the pensions they received, the village chiefs who are more aware of the situation can submit the details, together with their criticism, to the Aftermath Committee for reference, and can also order their family members to fully state their personal reasons in writing and submit them to the Trade Union or the Public Security Bureau to be forwarded to the Aftermath Committee for reference. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of this tragic incident, all parties related to the company and the political authorities have donated money to comfort the survivors. In addition to the donations received and distributed several times in the past few days, the company has recently received donations from the Qingdao General Company's mining office staff, totaling 1,134.88 yuan, which have been scheduled to be distributed together with the pensions on the 13th. It is said that the batch of donations included 1,000 yuan donated by Jin Yunpeng, 900 yuan donated by Japanese Ichikichi, 500 yuan donated by Gao Qingchang, and other Japanese staff members also donated their entire month's salary. However, Song Biru, the Chinese deputy director of the mining office, only donated 30 yuan, which is less than one-tenth of his monthly salary, so it is quite dissatisfied with by the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Anhui Province: Water Conservancy and Highway Construction; 42 Highway Lines Completed, Totaling 4,200 Kilometers <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Embankment Repairs Totaling 8,000 Kilometers; River Dredging Exceeding 2,000 Kilometers; Wuhu Communication: Anhui Construction Bureau Chief Liu Yiyan. Since the recovery of bandit areas in Jiangxi, various construction projects have advanced rapidly. As a model example, Liu traveled from Anhui to the capital at the beginning of the month, thoroughly inspecting various areas. After completing his business, he detoured to Zhejiang, passing through Hangzhou to reach Beijing.</p>
<p>He presented the past construction status and future plans of Anhui Province to the central government. On the 13th, he arrived in Wuhu from Beijing and met with the Wuhu Engineering Bureau Chief and the police chief, discussing implementation methods for construction in Wuhu. It is planned to first build roads along the docks, with funding either from public bonds or from the finance department, supplemented by local resources. A decision will be made upon his return to the province. Mr. Liu departed at 3 PM that afternoon, taking a fast boat back to Anqing. According to his statements before departure, the status of highway and water conservancy construction in Anhui Province is as follows:</p>
<p>Highways: Since September of the 21st year, Anhui Province has been rapidly constructing highways according to the main and branch lines decided in the Three Provinces and Seven Provinces Highway Conferences, as well as important routes designated by Anhui Province. As of the most recent count this year, 42 lines have been completed and opened to traffic, totaling 4,224 kilometers. Of these, 958 kilometers have paved surfaces and completed formal bridges. According to the routes determined by the Seven Provinces Highway Conference and the important routes designated by Anhui Province, there are over 6,000 kilometers in total. The proportion of currently completed and open lines accounts for 70% of the total. Currently under construction are six lines, including the Sheng-Yin Road (Anqing to Yin Jia Hui in Guichi) and the Shu-Liu Road (Shucheng to Liu'an), totaling 318 kilometers. Eleven routes, including Wu-Wu and Tai-Su, totaling 560 kilometers, have been surveyed or measured and are planned for construction soon. Eight routes, including Wu-Qing-Shou-He, totaling 917 kilometers, are in the planning stage. However, in Anhui Province, which has historically lacked road construction funds and has been plagued by frequent famines, the achievements so far have required tremendous effort. Further progress still relies on the assistance of the National Economic Commission to achieve complete success.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy: Anhui Province borders the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, making water conservancy extremely important. In the past, due to the laziness of the people and the neglect of annual repairs, coupled with the scarcity of public funds, the situation deteriorated daily. It was not until the great flood of the 20th year that people became aware of the need to both educate and supervise, formulating measures for phased advancement, learning from past mistakes, and preventing both floods and droughts. Implementation began in October of the 21st year and the first phase of work was completed in May of the 22nd year. The second phase was completed in September of the same year, and the third phase was completed in June of the 23rd year. The first two phases involved patching and emergency rescue and were not statistically detailed. Only the third phase had estimated and actual records. The work completed in the third phase included: (A) Repairing over 80 kilometers of embankments, adding over 46 million cubic meters of earth; (B) Dredging over 2,000 kilometers of rivers and ditches, removing over 20 million cubic meters of earth; (C) Increasing the volume of water storage ponds by over 3.7 million cubic meters. Starting in October of the 23rd year, the fourth phase of water conservancy projects continued to focus on both drought and flood prevention, with ongoing education and active implementation. Embankments in various areas are being repaired, and waterways are being dredged, including the major tributaries of the Huai River system, such as the West Fei River, Qian River, North Fei River, Yin River, Jie River, South and North Tuo Rivers, Bian River, and Shi Liang River, as well as other smaller rivers. As for the project funding, after much fundraising, only 80,000 yuan in cash and 6,500 shi of relief grain were obtained. These funds are being allocated to dredge the Chao Lake Shi Kou waterway and rivers within the Hua Yang water conservancy area, with construction scheduled for completion during this year's flood season.

<p>Due to the long drought, farmers and ordinary people alike were hoping for rain. However, every day was a scorching sun and dry wind sweeping the land. Although the mornings and evenings were cooler, the afternoons were unbearably hot. All living things felt parched, and people felt listless.

<p>Central News Agency reports that following the expulsion of overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies, a significant number of our compatriots were forced to return home. A previous telegram indicated that 216 overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies were aboard the Dutch vessel "Tsjisa Dani" bound for Hong Kong and Shanghai. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, and local overseas Chinese affairs agencies dispatched personnel to provide assistance. However, the expected refugees were not on board. After repeated inquiries, it was learned that these refugees were all from Guangdong and Fujian provinces and had disembarked in batches when the ship passed through those provinces to return to their native places.</p>
<h3 id="e100">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Take Over Inland River Shipping Today; Chen Wei-qing Appointed as Manager; Divided into Four Groups for Takeover of Various Vessels <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is scheduled to take over inland river shipping today. Yesterday, the general manager was appointed, and the methods for group takeover were determined. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>**Appointment of Staff**</p>
<p>Among the 25 shipping routes, 13 are leased out, while important trunk lines such as Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Lake, Shanghai-Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou, etc., are operated by the company itself. Several preparatory meetings have been held to discuss the operational directions for the self-operated routes. Chen Wei-qing, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Company, will concurrently serve as the manager of inland river shipping, and Xin Yao-xiang will be the director of the Zhenjiang Inland River Branch.</p>
<p>**Leased and Taken Over**</p>
<p>Chen, also the General Manager, has decided to take over the shipping routes operated by the company, and will immediately, together with the handover committee member sent by the Zhejiang Construction Department of Hangzhou, take over the ships, goods, and public property of the shipping company and its branches. It is currently planned to establish four groups for takeover. The first group will take over the ships, goods, wharves, and public property of the Shanghai Inland River Bureau first. The second group will take over the Zhenjiang Branch and its ships. The third group will take over the Hangzhou-Lake Branch and its ships. The fourth group will take over the branches, ships, and public property in various locations of Zhenjiang-Huai'an. After the four groups have completed the takeover, procedures for opening business will be carried out.</p>
<p>**Difficulty in Leasing**</p>
<p>Leasing is done through bidding, and the decision is made by the seven-member organizing committee. Several batches of people have bid in recent days, but the offered rents are too low and significantly differ from the company's proposed amounts, so no qualified bidders have been found. The bidders likely believe that since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is unwilling to operate these routes itself, there is no certainty in business, so they are unwilling to offer large rents, fearing future losses.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Joint Association of Various Groups in this City for Assisting Overseas Chinese in Siam, after the second standing committee meeting, decided to send Guangdong Fellow Association representative Zheng Ji-jie, Overseas Chinese Joint Association representative Huang Jian-zhong, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative Zhang Nan-yin, Chaozhou Fellow Association representative Guo Qi-ming, Ningbo Fellow Association representative Dong Xin-qin, and the Overseas Chinese Joint Association Secretary Chen Cheng-qin to Beijing on the 10 p.m. express train last night to petition the government. They will stay in Beijing for about four or five days and then return to Shanghai to proceed to Hong Kong and Guangdong to carry out the ban on Siamese rice. The petition of the delegation, the official letter to the Siam investigation delegation, and the telegrams from home and abroad are recorded below.</p>
<p>**Petition**</p>
<p>To: The Shanghai various groups assisting Siamese overseas Chinese joint association, for the Siamese government's arbitrary harsh example, oppressing the overseas Chinese, sincerely beg you to conduct serious negotiation, and swiftly establish a trade treaty with the country, in order to prevent the overseas Chinese in Siam from suffering at the hands of another race. We Chinese people do not hesitate to abandon our villages and leave our homes, venturing far across the seas, migrating to Indochina and the South Pacific islands. Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been people doing so, and since the opening of the seas, more and more Chinese people have gone abroad, especially to Siam. Statistics show that there are no less than three million of them. Historically speaking, Siam has long been a bulwark of our country, as close as lips and teeth. Geographically speaking, Siam's mountains and rivers mostly originate in our country, closely linked as one. Furthermore, in terms of race and religion, everything has a close relationship with our country. Not only that, but the contributions of our overseas Chinese to Siam are countless from ancient times to the present. People like Zheng Zhao, who led righteous soldiers to fight the Burmese in bloody battles, saving a country that was about to fall and establishing immortal achievements, and people in various industries such as commerce, industry, agriculture, and forestry, who were planned and operated by overseas Chinese, cutting through thorns and opening up paths, are the reason for today's prosperity. Otherwise, Siam would not have been able to survive like Vietnam, which was lost to France, and would have been destroyed by the British like Myanmar. Siam has been able to stand tall to this day. Even if the Siamese people do not regard our country as their suzerain, they should still treat overseas Chinese preferentially in every generation, remembering the source of their water. If they do not plan this way, they will become arrogant and forget the grace of re-creation and repay kindness with resentment. Harsh examples such as the import tax, residence tax, return tax, and literacy test that restrict overseas Chinese from entering the country were successively promulgated between 1928 and 1933, making it difficult for Chinese people to come to Siam, causing the number of immigrants to decrease sharply. Even for those who have already entered the country, they have implemented a sinicization policy, such as promulgating the Nationality Law, adopting the principle of birthright, recognizing that the children of overseas Chinese born in Siam are all Siamese and should be subject to military service obligations like the Siamese people, but not enjoy the same rights as the Siamese people. They have also cracked down on overseas Chinese education, closed Chinese schools, and recently forced overseas Chinese to specialize in Siamese literature and not be allowed to study Chinese. The schools established by overseas Chinese in Siam have no room to struggle. In other industries such as commerce and industry, there are also no restrictions. The viciousness of their methods is rarely seen in recent times. How can we bear to sit idly by and not save them? People from all walks of life in Shanghai are filled with righteous indignation and vow to back the overseas Chinese in Siam and force the Siamese government to abolish all kinds of harsh examples and improve the treatment of overseas Chinese. In addition to the organization of the joint association of various groups, the situation has been telegraphed to you in the past. Now, we recommend Huang Jian-zhong, representative of the Overseas Chinese United Association, Zhang Nan-yin, representative of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Zheng Ji-jie, representative of the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai, Dong Xin-qin, representative of the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai, and Guo Qi-ming, representative of the Chaozhou Fellow Association in Shanghai, to go to Beijing to petition. We beg you to forward the message to the National Government to send envoys to the Siamese government for serious negotiations and to swiftly establish a trade treaty with that country to protect the rights and interests of the overseas Chinese in Siam. The petition is urgently waiting for orders. The petitioner respectfully presents this petition.</p>
<p>**Letter to the Investigation Delegation**</p>
<p>Respectfully, we recently heard that your delegation has arrived, and our government, representing the people, has welcomed you. Our association, and the various groups affiliated with it, also express their utmost respect. In the midst of this festive atmosphere, our association is reluctant to raise other issues, forcing them upon your delegation, but in recent times, your country's mistreatment of overseas Chinese has intensified, making it unbearable, like a fishbone stuck in our throats that must be spat out. Therefore, on the day of your delegation's arrival in Nanjing, we specifically mention the close relationship between our two countries in the past and the disputes that have arisen now, for your delegation's review. Our country stands tall in East Asia, with a history of 5,000 years. Its past cultural development and the tolerance, endurance, and hard work of its national character have long been praised by the world. Therefore, in the past, when the country was strong, its prestige reached the small countries surrounding it, and they all paid tribute and sent envoys. Your country was also one of the vassal states. Although internal affairs were autonomous, the orders of the Chinese court reached far and wide. The relationship between our two countries can be seen in this. Since the eastward expansion of European powers, which eroded and swallowed up territories, many Asian countries have been destroyed by British, Russian, and French powers or have been reduced to semi-colonies. In this precarious situation, the only countries that have been able to maintain a precarious situation, strive for self-improvement, and still stand tall today are our two countries, as well as Japan, Persia, Afghanistan, Nepal, Turkey, and Arab countries. At a time when nationalism is prevailing in the world, imperialists are doing everything possible to invade, and weak countries are also trying to revive their nations to compete in the world. The situations of our two countries are similar. The Chinese people residing in your country not only sympathize with your country's efforts to strive for self-improvement but also bravely defend your country against foreign aggression, cutting through thorns and opening up paths. The reason for this is that our two countries have blood ties and are as close as brothers and sisters. Therefore, overseas Chinese have made great contributions to your country and are different from other countries' overseas residents. The Siamese should treat overseas Chinese with special preference, rewarding virtue and repaying kindness. How can they repay kindness with resentment? First, they promulgated immigration laws to restrict the entry of overseas Chinese, and then they forced education and closed Chinese schools. These harsh examples are not applied to overseas residents of other countries in Siam but only to overseas Chinese. How can this be considered fair? The intention of your country is nothing more than to assimilate our more than three million overseas Chinese to strengthen itself. It may be advantageous for its own purposes, but if we put ourselves in their shoes and your country's overseas residents are also subjected to heavy oppression by other countries, what would your country's officials and people think? Our association was shocked to hear about your country's destruction of overseas Chinese. At first, we were skeptical, and then we were heartbroken. If people of the same kind kill each other, our country will inevitably suffer losses, and your country may not have much benefit. For the sake of Sino-Siamese friendship and East Asian peace, instead of the snipe and clam fighting, only benefiting the fisherman, why not maintain the spirit of cooperation in the past, have a good beginning and a good ending, and coexist and prosper together? If our humble opinion is adopted, we hope that you will forward it to your government to abolish all kinds of harsh examples and improve the treatment of overseas Chinese as soon as possible, so that the feelings of the people of the two countries will not be broken. We would be very grateful. Respectfully, the Shanghai Various Groups Supporting Siamese Overseas Chinese Joint Association</p>
<p>**Telegram to All Circles**</p>
<p>Recently, a telegram was sent to the Central Party Department and the National Government, stating: "Since the news of the Siamese government's oppression of overseas Chinese has spread like wildfire, the people of the country are filled with righteous indignation. China and Siam are brotherly nations, and both are agricultural countries. Not only are the races and religions similar, but in terms of history and geography, they are as closely linked as the sides of a cart, sharing weal and woe. At a time when the world is turbulent and uneasy, in order to maintain East Asian peace, we weak nations should unite in spirit and help each other in the same boat. However, the Siamese government does not distinguish this and regards our overseas Chinese as easy to bully, promulgating all kinds of harsh examples and destroying them with all their might. Their ambitions are rampant, and they want to assimilate our three million overseas Chinese in Siam before they are satisfied. The severity of the situation is beyond anything else. Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution, as stated by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Although our country is now unified internally, the communists have not yet been completely wiped out, and unequal treaties have yet to be abolished. In the future, if we want to revitalize the nation, we will need overseas Chinese even more, so we must not ignore them. Moreover, the Siamese case is not a simple problem of the overseas Chinese themselves but is related to the survival of the entire country and nation. The various groups in Shanghai are alarmed by the warning of "treading on frost, hard ice," and dare not remain silent. Therefore, in the last month, they organized the Shanghai Various Groups Association for Assisting Overseas Chinese in Siam. Its only purpose is to promote the Siamese government's reflection and improve the treatment of overseas Chinese. It will not stop until it achieves its goal. In addition to further uniting compatriots at home and abroad to support the overseas Chinese in Siam, we should telegraph to you to quickly determine a policy, first to establish a formal international agreement with the Siamese government. If the authorities still have no sincerity, please consider the ban on Siamese rice imports, taking into account local conditions and consulting on appropriate measures, and implement them as soon as possible. Then the Siamese, who are arrogant and regard our country as a rice market, may eventually have the heart of regretting their mistakes, so that the overseas Chinese in Siam will not be trapped in anarchy and terror for a long time and be slaughtered by them. The future of the country and the people is very fortunate. The telegram is trembling and cannot bear to wait urgently for orders, etc. Before a trade treaty is established between China and Siam and the Siamese government improves the treatment of overseas Chinese, we should have a firm position, orderly steps, and jointly implement effective measures to resist Siamese goods to deal with them, hoping that the oppressed overseas Chinese can be relieved of their suffering. Since this matter is of great importance, it cannot be accomplished without the efforts of everyone. We hope that the party committees and governments of various provinces and cities will be responsible for guiding various groups at home and abroad to jointly support or quickly request the government to negotiate seriously, or awaken compatriots to deal with it in unison. This will not only save overseas Chinese from imminent danger but also benefit the future of the country and the nation. We hereby send this telegram, hoping that you will consider it."</p>

<h3 id="e108">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Others Presented a Petition Asking Not to Change the Dredging Plan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association jointly submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the National Economic Commission, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Department of Construction to implement the dredging plan to benefit the commercial port. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>**Dredging Plan Should Not Be Changed**</p>
<p>The petition is for the water of the Huangpu River, which is related to the national commercial economy. Now that the dredging plan is being implemented in order, it is not appropriate to discuss changes lightly. We humbly submit our views, hoping that you will examine and verify them, in order to attach importance to the commercial port and maintain water conservancy. It has been found that on May 3 of this year, the Shanghai newspapers reported that the Pudong Fellow Association submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, suggesting that the Huangpu waterway is gradually becoming shallow and narrow, which hinders commercial affairs and farmland, and requested the establishment of an organizing body, with four articles attached to the suggestion. According to the original text, the Huangpu River originates from Dianmao, with vast waves, and is the hub of national commerce and the lifeline of farmland in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. According to the old records of Songjiang Prefecture, the river surface is six or seven miles wide, but the report of the Qing Dynasty Dredging Bureau's actual measurement shows that Dongjiadu is 145 English feet wide. The land is close to the commercial port, and the land price is relatively high. People who seek profit fill it in the morning and occupy it in the evening. If it is not restricted, it will become like a ditch, and the fertile land of our Jiangsu and Zhejiang will become stony fields, and large ships will not be able to reach Huzhou and Hangzhou directly, which will make transportation inconvenient and reduce commercial activities, etc. After reading it, how can we not be suspicious? All four articles attached to the suggestion, except for one or two articles that are related to the Huangpu waterway, the other three or four articles belong to the scope of local administration. Although the association's suggestion is purely out of love for the hometown and for the sake of planning ahead and preventing trouble, it does not know that Shanghai is one of the four major commercial ports in the world, and the Huangpu waterway should be fully planned for international trade and ship transportation, considering it as the first commercial port in Southeast China. Although it is possible to take care of farmland in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and navigation in Huzhou and Hangzhou, the relative importance and urgency of the two should be compared. How can they be talked about in the same breath?</p>
<p>**The Dredging Project Has Significant Effects**</p>
<p>The Dredging Bureau was established in the first year of the Republic of China, and its affairs concern the Huangpu waterway and port affairs. Therefore, it first emphasized attracting specialized talents, which has become a past event and is especially obvious to everyone. Even in recent years, the most prominent thing is that since Director Song Ziliang took office, he has actively implemented improvements. The project of the existing waterway has been increasing the depth of the Huangpu River year by year. Giant ships with a draft of 30 English feet can now pass through without hindrance, and the progress of the dredging project has increased from 530,000 cubic feet per year to 1,070,000 cubic feet. The efficiency of the project has made rapid progress, and the accumulated deposits in the Bureau over the years have been transferred from foreign banks to the Central Bank, invisibly recovering great sovereignty. Moreover, the change in water conservancy is a specialized subject. In the distance, the Baihe River in Tianjin passes through Dagu. Although it has been dredged many times, costing no less than tens of millions, it is still suffering from siltation and has not achieved results to this day. The Yellow River has been called a disaster since ancient times, and the strategies for governing the river have been written into special books, filling countless books. The country spends huge sums of money every year, but breaches are still frequently heard. From this, it can be seen that governing rivers is not an easy task. It is important to be able to plan and implement a predetermined plan day by day and month by month in order to achieve success. How can it be changed easily? This is one reason. Moreover, the Dredging Bureau, in view of the increasing siltation of the Suzhou River waterway, which is related to the transportation of rice from the inland to Shanghai, also uses it for the transportation of garbage ships, etc. Once the ships are crowded, it is related to the people's food and hygiene. Song and the former Mayor Zhang, and the relevant agencies, planned to establish a dredging committee for the Wusong River and decided on a six-year plan, which is gradually being implemented this year. Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, the amount of sludge dug out has exceeded 300,000 cubic feet. The obvious effect of this can be seen here.</p>
<p>**No Need to Establish Another Organization**</p>
<p>In addition, the Bureau's construction of a large dredging ship has just been completed. Its efficiency and speed are excellent. Now that the shoal at the mouth of the Yangtze River has always been an obstacle to the navigation of import and export ships, the Bureau has decided to implement a dredging plan and is currently carrying out the work. This matter is of great importance. It is important to plan for the long term and seek a permanent solution for the commercial port. How can it be changed lightly? This is the second reason. Observing the above situation, although the annual fee of the Dredging Bureau is a huge sum of 460,000 taels, it is actually all used for the project. If one were to look at the Bureau's report, it is feared that the amount used is more than this, which is unknown to outsiders. Now, the Bureau is recruiting graduates from universities to train domestic water conservancy talents. Other water conservancy agencies, such as the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and the Taihu Water Conservancy Commission, often ask for dredging services, which shows the need. It is not appropriate to change the important Dredging Bureau, which has made great achievements, lightly because of the one-sided opinions of individual groups. Even if another organization is established, it may not be better than the current one. This is why the association believes that it is absolutely impossible. After the case was put forward for discussion, everyone agreed and unanimously decided to submit their views in writing, hoping that you will examine and verify them and not be moved by unfounded rumors, so as not to let the Dredging Bureau fail to complete its work, in order to attach importance to the commercial port and maintain water conservancy. The petitioner is eagerly waiting for orders. Respectfully submitted to the National Government Construction Office, the petitioners are Yu Zuoren, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and Yu Hede, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association.</p>
<h3 id="e109">National Association of Accountants Presents to the Ministry of Finance to Amend the Supervision and Liquidation Methods <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The liquidation period should still be six months according to the company law. Bank shareholders should not bear unlimited liability for the savings department.</p>
<p>Recently, in view of the decline in the market in this city and the closure of many silver and money businesses, the Ministry of Finance is deeply concerned that the progress will be hindered, and has promulgated six supervision and liquidation methods, and selected supervisors to supervise the progress. The National Association of Accountants believes that it is timely and important, but has some opinions on the second and fourth items, and has presented them to the Ministry of Finance. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>To: The petition is for the supervision and liquidation methods to be corrected according to law. On June 6, the newspaper reported that the Ministry of Finance issued instructions to the silver and money industries associations, stipulating six supervision and liquidation methods, and commissioned commissioners to supervise the liquidation of the recently closed firms and banks, so that the law can effectively protect the people, correct accumulated bad habits, and benefit merchants and people. The members of the association and the members of the affiliated associations are mostly accountants who perform their duties. They deeply feel that in the years since they have been carrying out liquidation cases, merchants and people have been used to accumulated bad habits and have not followed laws, and persuasion is ineffective, and difficulties arise during the process. Some members have also reported the difficulties to judicial and administrative officials, asking for supervision, but every time they are restricted by the fact that there is no precedent to refer to. Now that the Ministry of Finance has issued a new order for supervision and liquidation, they are deeply admired. However, the second item, which stipulates that the liquidation period is limited to three months, seems to be different from the provision in Article 61 of the Company Law that the liquidator should complete the liquidation within six months. According to the liquidation matters, the case involves hundreds of thousands of people. The Ministry of Finance sympathizes with the people's difficulties, so it is appropriate to order them to proceed as soon as possible, but the liquidation cases, procedures, and procedures are very detailed and prudent by law, and it takes a lot of time to proceed in order. For example, the Provisional Regulations for the Liquidation of Merchants' Debts stipulate that the period for reporting claims is 14 days to one month, and if there are branches and agents in remote places, the period may be extended. It also stipulates that the date of the creditors' meeting must be seven days to one month after the expiration of the claim reporting period. This only refers to the two items of reporting claims and convening a creditors' meeting, which already have a three-month limit. As for other matters, it will also take a considerable amount of time, not to mention the occurrence of various matters that hinder the processing in Article 16 of the Provisional Regulations for the Liquidation of Merchants' Debts. It is inevitable that there will be a delay in time. Instead of setting a limit that is difficult to implement, it is better to follow the provisions of the Company Law, so that it is consistent with the current legal system. In addition, Item 4 of the supervision and liquidation methods stipulates that if the assets are discounted and the debts cannot be fully offset, a bank organized as a joint-stock limited company should apply for bankruptcy according to law. The remaining banks or money houses organized as joint-stock limited companies that also operate savings business should impose joint and several unlimited liability on the managers, directors, supervisors, and shareholders according to law. According to Article 15 of the Savings Bank Law, if the assets of the savings bank are insufficient to repay the debts of the depositors, the directors and supervisors shall bear joint and several unlimited liability, and there is no provision for shareholders to bear joint and several unlimited liability. Although a bank organized as a joint-stock limited company also operates savings business, its shareholders should still be shareholders of a limited company. If the assets are insufficient to offset the debts due to the poor management of the savings department, the directors and supervisors are responsible to the shareholders. Therefore, their joint and several unlimited liability is only limited to the savings department. The shareholders of a bank organized as a joint-stock limited company that does not operate savings business should not be changed from limited to unlimited, nor should the directors and supervisors of a bank organized as a joint-stock limited company that does not operate savings business be liable for all debts of the bank. Therefore, it is proposed that the Ministry of Finance amend it according to law to "The remaining banks or money houses should impose joint and several unlimited liability on the managers, directors, supervisors, and shareholders according to law. Banks organized as joint-stock limited companies that also operate savings business should impose joint and several unlimited liability on the directors and supervisors for the debts of the savings department." The association has not received any clear instructions, but it is only based on newspaper reports, and it is not dare to speculate whether it is consistent with the original text. However, because the merchants and people of our country may not be familiar with the legal system, and if they see the words "joint and several unlimited liability", they are afraid that doubts will arise and the shadow will be great. We humbly offer our humble opinions, hoping that they will be adopted and revised, which will be a great blessing for merchants and people.</p>

<p>Hygiene Movement</p>
<p>The 14th Hygiene Movement Conference opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday at the Nanshi Public Stadium. The exhibition opened at 2:00 p.m. at New World. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>**Representatives from All Walks of Life**</p>
<p>Those who attended included Director of the Health Bureau Li Tingan, Director of the Public Security Bureau Cha Jingjun, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department Tong Xingbai, Boy Scout Council Luo Lie, General Labor Union Shao Xubai, Education Bureau Yuan Zengyu, Youth Association Ling Xitao, Municipal Education Association Li Guangteng, Mrs. Jin Longzhang, Mrs. Li Tingan, as well as student representatives and Boy Scouts from Peiben, Minli, Junyi, Wuben, Hean, and Wanzhu schools, totaling more than 500 people.</p>
<p>**Venue Arrangement**</p>
<p>The entire conference was held at the Daji Road Public Stadium. The Party and National flags and a white cloth banner with the words "Shanghai 14th Hygiene Movement Opening Ceremony" were hung at the entrance. A mat shed was set up in the center of the venue facing north as the rostrum. The Party and National flags and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen were hung in the center. Two couplets on the left and right read: "Ten years of teaching, hygiene is the most important" and "The people participate, watching the success of the movement". The military band was on the left side of the stage, and students and Boy Scouts were lined up on the left and right sides.</p>
<p>**Chairman's Report**</p>
<p>The presidium consisted of Li Tingan and his wife, Zhang Xingzhe, Cai Jingjun, Fu Changfu Sui Xubai, and Mrs. Jin Longzhang. After the formalities were completed, Chairman Li Tingan reported, "Distinguished guests, students, today is the opening ceremony of the 14th Shanghai Hygiene Movement Conference. I am very honored to have your enthusiastic participation. The purpose of the hygiene movement is to reduce the suffering of the people from diseases, increase the effectiveness of services, and enable citizens to have a healthy physique and prolong their lives. The average lifespan of Chinese people is only 30 years, which is almost half that of Europe and the United States. Regarding the preparation process for this year, it was initiated by the Health Bureau, and 25 groups including the Municipal Government Secretariat participated. All groups have economic assistance. Today, I would like to thank the Health Bureau on behalf of the Health Bureau. As for its organization, the preparatory committee is organized by the initiating groups. At the same time, a hygiene exhibition will be held at New World this afternoon. The exhibits include charts and models from the Central Health Department, the Seaport Quarantine Office, the Municipal Health Bureau, the Public Concession Health Office, and the French Concession Health Office. The difference between this hygiene movement and the previous ones is that (1) Boy Scouts and students take an oath, intending to make them work hard to promote hygiene, so as to achieve the same longevity, (2) Vigorously carry out smoking bans. According to President Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, three smoking cessation hospitals have been established in this city, (3) Prevent rabies, (4) Kitchen competition. All measures are to promote hygiene. I hope that all sectors will promote more so that it can achieve results."</p>
<p>**Tong Xingbai's Speech**</p>
<p>Lu Chu Tong Xingbai gave a speech, saying that the hygiene movement is very important to human life,</p>

<p>Special Issue for the Inaugural Meeting of the Chinese Children's Culture Association</p>
<p>Preparatory Process of the Association Lin Yin</p>
<p>(1) Motivation</p>
<p>When the association was initiated, there were only three of us, He Gongchao, Huang Jiping, and myself. We casually talked during our spare time. We felt that the output and quality of Chinese children's books were problematic. Although there was a large quantity, the quality was very poor. In particular, the content and form of general reading materials were only suitable for children to memorize and not for them to use actively. Therefore, we wanted to organize a group to connect authors of children's books and elementary school teachers to critique the existing children's books and newspapers, and on the one hand, create new books and newspapers. With this goal in mind, we drafted a preamble and a few simple articles of association to solicit opinions from our acquaintances. This was around July or August last year. By February of this year, more than twenty people had signed that opinion paper. Especially Dong Chuncai, Bai... they were very enthusiastic. At this time, Gongchao and I jointly issued a notice to hold the first initiators' meeting.</p>
<p>(2) Initiators' Meeting</p>
<p>Nineteen comrades attended this initiators' meeting. Everyone was very excited and expressed their opinions on the organization of the association. They believed that children's cultural work was not limited to books and newspapers. While the current issues with books and newspapers needed criticism and creation, other aspects of children's cultural work required our efforts even more. Moreover, this work could not be borne by a few of us alone. It was necessary to unite elementary school teachers, children's newspaper editors, illustrators, the publishing industry, and parents of children across the country to jointly shoulder the responsibility. Therefore, it was decided that the association would be named the Chinese Children's Culture Association, with the purpose of studying children's issues and promoting children's culture. More comrades would be sought to join as initiators to expand our scope of work and work together. Subsequently, Huang Jingwan, Hu Shuyi, Chen Jicheng, Xu Fengchang, Wei Bingxin, Ma Chonggan, and Sun Yucai all enthusiastically joined. We held the first initiators' meeting on March 24th. More than forty people attended. On the one hand, we proceeded with the organizational formalities, and on the other hand, we began to do a lot of practical work.</p>
<p>(3) Work During the Preparatory Period</p>
<p>Of course, this short three-month preparatory period was very rushed. Moreover, Children's Day was also within our preparatory period. At that time, although we had not yet received the approval document from the Municipal Party Department to organize, the work was already in front of us, and we had to do it. Therefore, we sent representatives to participate in celebrations in several places where gatherings were held, and distributed the association's views on current children's cultural work. We also invited Comrade Wei Bingxin to broadcast a speech on the radio at the Sino-Western Radio Station about Children's Day and family education. Soon, the approval document from the Municipal Party Department came down. We immediately organized a preparatory committee to speed up the establishment. We also edited a series of books titled "Children of Today," inviting educators and scholars with specialized research from across the country to contribute articles, with the intention of publishing them at the opening of Children's Year to serve as a reference for comrades serving in the children's ranks of Children's Year. To expand the association's foundation and strengthen its power, the initiators' meeting resolved that each initiator must solicit at least five members. In order to make the association's work practical, it was necessary to bridge the gap between adults and children. Therefore, it was decided to welcome children to join the association, with a membership fee of only two jiao per year, so that children would not have an excessive burden. At this time, Shanghai was also launching a campaign to eradicate illiteracy. We immediately felt that this was an opportunity for practical work. In this campaign, children should be the focus of practical experiments. We first specially invited the Huacun Public Basic School and the Yingye Elementary School to implement literacy service groups using the "little teacher" system, and appointed Huang Jingwan and Sun Yucai as instructors to guide the little teachers on how to participate in this important work in the community. Starting this month, we also regularly broadcast children's education issues and children's programs every week on the Xin Xin Radio Station. Although we only had a short three-month preparatory period, the current work has already forced us to not delay the establishment any longer. The enthusiasm for organizing branches everywhere and the many tasks that must be started after the establishment are all reasons why we decided to hold the inaugural meeting today. Of course, during the initial stage, many tasks cannot satisfy everyone's wishes. We only hope that after the establishment, all members can work faithfully. This is not only the glory of the association, but also the happiness of children across the country. My simple and intermittent report, of course, cannot avoid omissions. I hope the comrades will forgive me.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The World of Children Wei Bingxin <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>"The 20th century is the century of children," this sentence has been recognized worldwide. Indeed, to build a progressive society and create a world of great harmony, we can only hope for the next generation of children. The future world is the world of children, and modern children are the backbone of building society and creating the world in the future.</p>
<p>Look, the modern warlords and militarists around the world, who are addicted to war and vying for territory, only have the ambition to dominate and seize power. Where do they have the grand vision of creating a peaceful world?</p>
<p>Look, the modern politicians around the world, who abuse their authority and stir up trouble, only have the idea of becoming high officials and seeking profit. Where do they have plans to build a good society?</p>
<p>Look, the modern farmers and laborers around the world, who shed blood and sweat and sell their labor, can only seek food and clothing for themselves and avoid freezing and starvation. They lack the power to weave and shoulder the responsibility of building society and transforming the world.</p>
<p>Look, the modern scholars around the world, who study knowledge and sell it, can only sell their articles and seek a livelihood for themselves. They rarely shoulder the responsibility of building society and transforming the world.</p>
<p>However, although the lofty ideals of modern humanity have been hindered by human power and various environmental obstacles and cannot be realized, if we do not advocate, promote, and strive hard, in the next generation, we will surely be able to create a paradise for humanity, bloom bright flowers, and bear sweet fruits. All problems, whether personal, family, social, national, or worldwide, can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Especially in our country, which was once a colony in the international arena, to break away from the oppression of imperialism and obtain true independence and equality, it is necessary for the children to continue to work hard in the future in order to have the possibility of realization.</p>
<p>Therefore, the modern children's issue is really the key to all issues. It is the fundamental issue of all issues. In modern China, we must especially focus on the children's issue with all our strength and cultivate new Chinese children who can shoulder the responsibility of building a progressive society and creating a world of great harmony in the future.</p>
<p>The Chinese Children's Culture Association is shouldering this mission. However, this mission is indeed too great. I hope that people across the country who are engaged in children's cultural work will join our group and work together.</p>
<h3 id="e113">How Is Our Work? He Gongchao <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this association is to engage in various cultural activities within the scope of children (including literature, art, sports...). But don't think that as long as it is cultural work, it is beneficial to children. If we still tell children stories that end with becoming officials and getting rich, and teach children to sing songs like "Taohua Jiang," are we benefiting children or harming them? The work of this association should obviously be the opposite of these, or to put it more precisely, it should be:</p>
<p>Collective and aesthetic, not individualistic. We want to enable children to engage in activities as a group, so that they understand that within a group, everyone has the right to equal development and enjoyment, and oppose those activities that cultivate children's individualistic heroic thoughts and desires for leadership.</p>
<p>Striving, not enjoying. Even if we organize a children's trip, we will definitely not prepare a special train and invite the children to relax in those scenic spots. Instead, we should have the children take the train and visit on their own, like the children of a certain elementary school in Huai'an, so that they can experience the cold looks of the station staff and know the dangers on the road of life, and let them visit the Indian "Asan" and compatriots in the slums of Shanghai and know the pain of being slaves and becoming slaves.</p>
<p>For the majority, not for the minority. Our work should focus on the poor children who make up more than 90% of the country. Therefore, geographically speaking, we should not only circle in the residential areas of Shanghai, but should develop towards the countryside and factory areas. In terms of knowledge level, we should not only deal with school children, but should shake hands with illiterate children. In terms of wealth standards, we should not only know how to please the children of wealthy families, but should strive for those poor children who have no clothes or food.</p>
<p>Forward-looking, not backward-looking. The thoughts and concepts contained in all our work (such as a children's song, a story, a music broadcast) should be progressive, revolutionary, active, and optimistic, and should not be passive, pessimistic, or unrevolutionary. We also oppose superstitious legends, bizarre stories, the concept of cause and effect, and the idea of retreating from life, such as hermitage in the mountains and forests.</p>
<p>If the work of this association follows the path described above, it will be able to fulfill its necessary mission in this historical stage. Otherwise, it may fall into becoming an agency that merely decorates the era of peace.</p>

<p>The 20th century is a century in which the women's rights movement has led to the expansion of children's rights. Ellen Key simply called this "the century of children." The importance of children-centeredness has long been felt in various countries around the world, and deep attention has been paid to children's affairs, which are also developing. Soviet Russia is a socialist country. They not only widely establish nurseries to educate the children of ordinary workers, but also have many special organizations, such as children's science research institutes and children's art research institutes, to fully cultivate children's physical and mental development. Italy is a fascist country. Their training for young party members is divided into three stages. While exercising their physique, they also teach party ideology. They also believe that educating children is one of the most important undertakings of the country. After the war, Germany always had the determination to seek revenge and revive the country. While developing science and striving for construction, it also paid attention to children's education in order to cultivate the foundation of the country. Children are the future masters of the country. China's most basic and important work in seeking national rejuvenation and family prosperity is to pay attention to children's affairs. The Chinese Children's Culture Association is a new group that pays attention to children's cultural affairs. Here, we are all willing to seek welfare for children. To put it bluntly, it is also to work hard for the national rejuvenation movement.</p>

<p>Since the association published an advertisement last autumn to recruit football referees, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic. The football committee members He Chunhui, Chen Jixiang, and Shen Huichun strictly assessed the applicants through written, oral, and practical tests. Six people passed the preliminary test, and after a long period of testing, only Jiang Lianggui and Liang Denghai were officially selected as football referees.

<p>Women's World Idleness Bi Yao Often reported in newspapers: In many places in the country, this village has killed people, and the dogs in that village smell the blood and lose their guarding duties, vying to lick the heads and blood of people. The old men, seeing this abnormal behavior of animals, only think that the way of heaven has changed, and they are frightened and amazed.</p>
<p>In fact, there is nothing to be frightened about. Aren't the villages there all bare? Being a dog is also very boring, so naturally they go to places with trumpets and bloodshed to relieve their boredom. This is the norm of animal nature.</p>
<p>No matter what it is, when it gets too idle, it likes strange and novel tastes. The reason why patients want to eat this and that in bed is the same.</p>
<p>Over the years, the whole country has been desperately focused on women, is there really something big about women? It's just picking up this strange taste to cure their idleness. Therefore, all events involving young women will cause a city-wide uproar. Just look at the recent "Jinan Scandal," how sensational it is!</p>
<p>"(Jinan Express) The sensational Jinan Education Department instructor Zhou Guangyan, whose wife, a female normal school student Wang Zhixian, was seduced and eloped by Wang Chongfan, an employee of the arsenal, causing a scandal. All civil servants in the province were unanimously indignant and planned to ask Governor Han Fuqu to strictly pursue... Unexpectedly, Wang and others were arrested on the 4th of this month in Liuhe County, north of the capital of Jiangsu Province. After the news spread to Shandong, the once silent scandal became very active in society, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. All parties still unanimously advocate strict punishment.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also many letters from young students from various places to comfort Zhou Guangyan, and many people offer ideas on Zhou's behalf. Looking back since June 1st, no one in the Pingjin area has not been sweating from the summer heat; while in the Qilu area, it is warm and people are overturned for peach blossoms, indignant for peach blossoms, and tense for peach blossoms. With just a river separating them, the north and south are so different!</p>
<p>Does the combination or separation of a pair of men and women among the 400 million people have even a hair's worth of impact on others? But the social people, even the civil servants who have the responsibility to defend the territory and protect the people, are moved to public anger for this. It should be clear that they are "idle." Everyone suffers from idleness, arguing over private matters between men and women, how can the affairs of the country be not so impressive?</p>
<p>The source of idleness, some is stolen by oneself, some is given by others. Those who love themselves will certainly not steal idleness, but at the same time, they will not guard the idleness given by others. The dogs that run from the countryside to other villages to lick blood are given a deserted and idle place by the people in chaos; dogs are animals, unable to compete with humans, and they can be content with that position. If even the people in the sub-colonial territories who cannot steal idleness are still mired in "idleness" and cannot extricate themselves, then what kind of thing are they comparing themselves to?</p>
<p>We don't want to see women who are so idle that they fall into the web of love like drunkards, staging peach blossom incidents beyond reason like Liu Lu. We also don't want to see men suffering from "idleness," only knowing to sniff women with sharp noses, constantly playing peach blossom incidents or being nervous for others' peach blossom incidents. Because the current society is male-centered, they bear the majority of the responsibility for all the evils that cause society and the country to sink and perish. Women's Issues Lecture, Section 4: The French Revolution and Women Jun Hui</p>
<p>The current capitalist society is certainly not something that suddenly appeared. It has gone through various stages of development, and it must go through the firm struggle of the industrial and commercial citizens to be realized. This stage of development can be divided into three. Namely, the First Religious Revolution (1517), the Second English Revolution (1688), and the Third is the French Revolution in which the industrial and commercial citizens finally gained political power.</p>
<p>The French Revolution gave a great influence on the women's liberation movement and thought. This influence is most fully expressed in the famous Declaration of the Rights of Man. Under the feudal absolute monarchy, all common people completely lost their status as "humans," not to mention that women were destined to be slaves. A small number of feudal special people arbitrarily extracted the blood and sweat of the masses, doing whatever they wanted, living a life of paradise on earth, while the majority of people engaged in production, especially women, suffered the pain of hell in this world. Under this status quo, the bourgeoisie rose up! Holding up the flags of freedom, equality, and fraternity, they declared the rights of the people and attacked the feudal forces. Their flags and their claims were righteous and justified. Therefore, the workers and peasants who had suffered from oppression for years enthusiastically participated in the revolutionary ranks, and the most oppressed women bravely participated in the rebellion of the masses. As a result, the autocratic kingdom was overthrown, and the industrial and commercial citizens seized power and established a new government. However, the workers and peasants and women who directly shed blood did not get any rights. Instead, they suffered from the suppression and massacre of the new government! They only replaced the old oppressor with a new target of oppression.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the French Revolution marked an important stage of evolution in history. From then on, human material and spiritual civilization has not been subject to any restrictions and has developed rapidly, thus creating a brilliant modern culture.</p>
<p>The Declaration of the Rights of Man in the French Revolution and the American Declaration of Independence (1776) are epoch-making documents with profound significance in the history of human liberation. It not only expresses the demands of all oppressed people, but also gives a very profound and powerful hint to the masses of women who have long lost their human rights. The Declaration of Independence states: "All men are created equal, endowed with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Government is instituted to protect these rights, deriving its powers from the consent of the governed. The Declaration of the Rights of Man also contains the following claims: "Article 1: Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good. Article 2: The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man." Although it does not specifically point out the rights of women, since women are a part of humanity, they naturally have the right to obtain the same freedom and equality as men. Although bourgeois society did not give women any rights after the American War of Independence and the French Revolution, the above two declarations did indeed become the main opportunity for women to begin to demand all human rights.</p>
<p>At the time of the French Revolution, on the one hand, a large number of knowledgeable women who had fully absorbed modern liberal ideas had emerged among the industrial and commercial women. On the other hand, with the expansion of industrial production, the number of female workers in major cities, especially in Paris and Marseille, increased alarmingly. These two types of women formed the main combat force in the revolutionary rebellion. According to historical records, the female workers of Paris participated in the struggle to occupy the Bastille prison. The female workers were led by Rosa Lacombe, Madeleine Chabry, and Lénardoux, and organized the Versailles attack team. Of particular interest is the escort of Louis XVI to Paris by the Women's Guard.</p>
<p>There were two main female leaders in the French Revolution, one was Theroigne de Mericourt and the other was Lacombe. Theroigne de Mericourt had a passionate fighting character. She led the crowd to occupy the Bastille prison, so the National Assembly awarded her a sword of honor in recognition of her. On October 5th, the day of the attack on Versailles, she wore a red dress and rode a horse to attack Versailles in support of the revolutionary spirit of the women. On August 10th, in order to defend the Republican government, she gave speeches all night in the square, demanding the establishment of the true supreme power of the people.</p>
<p>Lacombe was also a woman who participated in the Versailles march. She was the true leader of the working women in the suburbs of Paris. She often lived with the lower-class women. She was a woman with outstanding organizational skills, beautiful voice, and appearance. She shouted from the auditorium of the Legislative Assembly: "Defend the revolution from the invasion of the Allied forces!" At the same time, she demanded "popularization of power." When attacking the palace on August 10th, her arm was injured. The National Assembly specially awarded her the glorious "Civic Crown." She founded the "Revolutionary Women's Club" to educate the masses of women with the spirit of revolution. She was a famous eloquent female Jacobin member. She not only advocated the rights of women, but also demanded the interests of the masses of women. She shouted:</p>
<p>"What benefits have women received under the Republican system!"</p>
<p>Editorial Office After Mr. Wang Xiaoying published "An Interpretation of the Principles Given to a Female Youth" in this journal, readers have sent in articles one after another, expressing their opinions. It can be seen that the women's movement is being cared for by people. It is planned to disclose the main points in the next issue for public discussion. Please pay special attention to readers. Girls Living a Mouse Life Qian Since being responsible in the small building on Street Mi and recognizing the deformed society in this area, there have been two sounds that knock on my eardrums and make me tremble uncontrollably. That is the sound of the patrol car's horn and the "beep" of the Western machine foot road car.</p>
<p>This street was a graveyard of ghosts eight years ago. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, it has begun to expand and develop until today. Its position of prosperity is about to catch up with the intersection of Annam Road and Hede Road. The morning vegetable market here is very bustling and noisy. The vegetable market is a temporary vegetable market where many vegetable vendors set up stalls along the street every morning. In addition to the stalls connected one after another in front of people's doors, there are countless vegetable vendors carrying one or two baskets or carrying two baskets selling while walking and shouting. Among these vegetable vendors, women, especially young girls, are the majority. Nine out of ten of them do not have public hawker permits.</p>
<p>We Chinese people, living in the concessions leased by imperialists, which should have been our own territory, cannot live in houses unless we pay house donations, and cars cannot pass through without paying car donations. If you want to do business, you can't even think about making a living without a business permit. These young girls selling vegetables have no license to do business in the concession, but they want to make a living in the concession, so their business situation is completely secretive, like mice. Every time they stop a customer, they always look around left and right, look forward and backward, to see if there is any danger of patrolmen coming. If they don't see any, they slowly haggle over the price of the vegetables (according to the general situation, the vegetables sold by these vendors are cheaper than those in the vegetable stalls), but if they catch sight of a patrolman from afar, they casually take some money and run to the attached alley or lane. In this situation, they often don't have time to collect the money, pick up the basket or shoulder the burden and run away. At this time, the customers who have already put the vegetables in their own baskets, those with cruel hearts, often take the opportunity to rob them, picking up the basket and leaving. After the patrolmen pass, those vegetable-selling girls who have suffered losses have to admit their bad luck.</p>
<p>This wonderful scene of the patrolmen chasing unlicensed vegetable vendors is the most fierce at nine or ten o'clock in the morning. At that time, the vegetable market is booming, and the streets are crowded with vegetable vendors and buyers. Looking up, you can see nothing but black heads, like a big river full of watermelons. Suddenly, without everyone knowing, a patrol car stopped from afar. Several Western and Chinese patrolmen got out of the car. Soon, there will be a big commotion in the vegetable market. Those vegetable vendors without permits are really scared and run around with their heads in their hands. As a result, the car always carries five or six unfortunate people away every morning. When the car drives away with its unique horn, my heart will sink in my body.</p>
<p>According to a vegetable-selling girl, the first time they go to the police station to register to sell vegetables, they need seven silver dollars, and then they need to pay two silver dollars every month to renew the permit. If they are taken to the police station without a permit, they will be fined five cents each time. If they have no money, they will be jailed for a day. As for their daily business, they can sell at most one thousand copper coins. In good times, they can earn three or four hundred cash. In bad times, two or three hundred or one or two hundred cash is uncertain. In this way, all their earnings for five or six days are not enough to pay for one penalty, let alone buy a permit. Besides, they have to buy something to survive every day. This is why they live a mouse life.</p>
<p>And this kind of vegetable-selling girl living such a life – a mouse life – there are also peddlers who sell snacks all day long on the streets. Recently, there are more and more such peddlers on the streets every day. They are all young girls who have not been in the city for long from the countryside. You can tell this just by looking at the red hair ropes on their upturned braids and the rural atmosphere all over them. The items they sell change with the seasons. When the weather is not hot, they sell chestnuts, and then gradually change to sugar plums, Shandong loquats. Now they are selling big sweet peaches. Although the police station does not have special cars to take them away in batches at noon and afternoon, Western patrolmen riding machine foot road cars and Chinese patrolmen riding ordinary bicycles come to patrol the streets every hour. When they chase, they chase in cars. Poor these yellow-haired girls have to train their vision and hearing to be as sharp as mice in order to live and save their lives. When they run, they really have to kick their hooves and fly.</p>
<p>One day, a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl peddler, carrying a basket of loquats, ran desperately into the alley next door. When I rushed down to see, she was lying crookedly next to the refuse bin like a dead rat, her face pale, and she was still muttering hysterically, "Oh, here they come! Oh, here they come!" At this time, my eyes immediately saw clearly that Zhao Liujia, the vegetable-selling girl who was chased and beaten to death by the Western patrolmen not long ago, was here. And I saw even more clearly that these poor girls who cannot afford permits but have to make a living in the tiger's mouth have the possibility of dying tragically like this every day.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Society's Girls' Association is discussing the health problems of girls in the parks of the foreign masters, asking girls to pay attention to exercise and swimming. I think the healthy and beautiful bodies of those girls in the greenhouse will not be used to escape the claws of the imperialists like these girls living a mouse life, will they? Mom's Days Yingzi He, the father of the child, he hates children the most. When the child was born, he was ready to send her to the nursery. I refused. In such a dangerous society, if a girl is abandoned, what will her future be like? I would rather throw her into the Huangpu River than let her be humiliated and suffer in the future. As long as we can barely survive, which mother would be willing to abandon her children? He often said: What do you want her for? We are still young, are we afraid of not having children in the future? I can't support her. I can't be a beast of burden for you and the child, ruin myself, sell myself. A person should plan for a career, for life, for our happiness, the only way is to send her away. Whenever the child cried, he would mutter this long speech.</p>
<p>"Crying is his language, don't you allow him to cry? Children always cry..."</p>
<p>"I hate crying, I can't support her, it's not a crime to send her away, right! You see, I'll send her to the nursery tomorrow. You're not allowed to make noise. If you love me, you have to listen to me..." He looked at me with stern eyes, as if a judge was waiting for a prisoner's answer.</p>
<p>"Okay; do as you please, please rest in peace! Don't make noise, there are many classes tomorrow." I answered him, suppressing the anger in my stomach,</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock the next day, he really sent the child to the nursery. After the child was taken away, I cried, crying very sadly. I have never been a person who cries and doesn't shed tears. This time, there were more tears than spring rain? Through the efforts of friends, after spending four dollars in handling fees, the child was still brought back. How happy I am! Before the child was brought back, my heart was always beating. I was always afraid of being taken away by others. I didn't even know why. It seems that as soon as a child is born, there is an indestructible emotion with the mother. I think maternal love is the purest and most sincere. Before I became a mother, I didn't feel that maternal love was so great. Before, when I saw many children being very fierce to their mothers, I thought to myself, why don't you kill such a son? Now I know that there is no mother who does not love her children, no matter how bad the children are to her, she will understand and still love them!</p>
<p>Mother, my mother far away across the mountains and rivers, when holding your grandson, I will think of how you raised us sisters in the past. I am very sad and ashamed, mother: you are already old, you have already entered the twilight years with disheveled white hair, and you still often worry about your daughter who is drifting far away. What comfort does she have for you?</p>
<p>May 23rd These few days, I have been very troubled in my heart. The child is noisy and crying, and I feel even more sad. I wish I could give her a good beating, but what does such a small child know?</p>
<p>Arguing with his father for the sake of the child has also become commonplace. When the child cries, he insists on sending her to someone else's house, saying that he can't support her,</p>
<p>"Go find a lady who doesn't have children: otherwise, you can be a monk," I was so angry with him, I felt he was too selfish. He saw that I liked the child and was afraid that I would be indifferent to him. I don't know if every young father is like this.</p>
<p>"I, I always want her to be able to live on her own,"</p>
<p>"Who doesn't want to live on their own, who wants to fall? When the child is weaned, I will go to work. I don't have knowledge, but I have a healthy body, so I can always work,"</p>
<p>"Isn't it good to send this foot-binding ghost away? Go exercise yourself, for your future"</p>
<p>"If you want to send her away, first discuss it with your father. If they all say to send her away, I will send her away"</p>
<p>"This is a matter between the two of us, why ask them? Will he support you for the rest of your life in the future?"</p>
<p>"My God, you don't understand me at all, who wants to rely on others..."</p>
<p>What's the use of arguing? It will only damage our feelings. Now I have changed my attitude. When he talks about these things, I will talk about something else. When the child is older, I will live my own life! Legal Q&amp;A Xing Yingming asks: I married Mr. Zhang in the first year of Xuantong. My father (who is still alive) has a lot of wealth: but he is stubborn and values ​​sons over daughters. I have twelve siblings in total. Now because the population is growing day by day, there is a proposal to divide the family. However, I was not included, which is very surprising. However, because I don't have legal knowledge, I have no confidence to negotiate with him. I have a few questions, and I hope Mr. can teach me: (1) Do I have the right to be divided? (2) Is it against the law if my father is unwilling to give it to me? And can I legally request a division? (3) If he currently owes some debts, will I be obligated to repay them if I receive property? (Answer) The inheritance of this case has not yet begun. (According to the inheritance, it begins when the deceased dies.) Your father is making a gift because the children are dividing the family, and he is legally free to do so. Also, because the inheritance has not yet begun, the lady has no obligation to repay the debts owed by your father. Because lifetime gifts are different from estate analysis.

<p>Special Telecommunications Edition Voice of the Telecommunications Industry Recent Major Reforms in the Telecommunications Administration Organization De The biggest shortcomings in my country's telecommunications administration organization are (1) Ununified business, (2) Ununified engineering. Regarding the problem of telegraph business, fortunately, our authorities have adhered to the spirit of courageously advancing and worked hard, and were able to merge the local bureaus and stations in order, and since April of this year, the Qingdao, Jinan, Xiamen, Wanxian, Fuzhou, Yantai, Changsha and other bureaus and stations have wireless telegraph rooms, and the work of relocation and merger in one place has been implemented. Not only is the management convenient, but also the transmission speed is increased. As for the telephone business problem, in the past, the long-distance telephones in each province were managed by the telephone operators of each line (for example, the telephone operators of long-distance telephones such as Jiqing, Jinghu, etc.) were responsible for the jurisdiction. Then it was renamed as the long-distance telephone operators of each province. It was not until April of this year that the Long-Distance Telephone Administration Bureau was merged into the Telecommunications Administration Bureau, and the original operators were still in charge of long-distance telephone affairs. Since then, the business of reporting and telephone in the entire region has been under the unified command of the Administration Bureau. Needless to say, it is helpful to the development of the telecommunications business. This is one of the major reforms in my country's telecommunications administration organization. Secondly, regarding the engineering problem: it is found that although the long-distance telephone business is under the jurisdiction of the Administration Bureau, the maintenance and maintenance of the trunk and branch lines are still the responsibility of the Trunk Line Engineering Office and the Engineering Section of the Administration Bureau respectively. Not only is it difficult to divide the duties of the chief engineer and the director of engineering, but also the organization inevitably has the drawbacks of overlapping beds and houses. Now the Ministry of Communications resolutely merges all the trunk line engineering offices into the Administration Bureau, and all duties are completely the responsibility of the Engineering Section of the Administration Bureau. And it is stipulated to be implemented from July 1st of this year. From then on, whether it is trunk line, engineering, or branch line engineering, it is under the unified control of the Administration Bureau, and the authority has been concentrated, and the expenses have been reduced. This is the second major reform in my telecommunications administration organization. What is more, recently, the telegraph and telephone bureaus in Wuxian and Zhenjiang have been merged. The importance of the language number is really no less than the above two reforms. The reporter hopes that our authorities will continue to implement their proposals and merge the local telephone bureaus and report bureaus in order to exert the highest efficiency in administration. The Relationship between the Gold Franc and International Telegraphs Yuncheng The telegrams between China and foreign countries are called international telegrams. The fees and various handling procedures for this kind of telegrams must be handled in accordance with the International Telecommunication Convention and the attached telegraph rules jointly established by more than 70 countries around the world. Article 32 of the Convention states that the price of international telegrams should be based on the gold franc. The so-called gold franc is a hypothetical currency with a total weight of 10/31 of a gram and a gold content of 900/1000. According to this calculation, its value is about five times that of the French franc currently in actual use. Before the gold price fell in mid-January of this year, one French franc was worth about two jiao of our country's silver dollars, so one gold franc was worth about one yuan of our country's silver dollars. Later, the gold price gradually fell, and the value of the French franc decreased from two jiao to one jiao nine fen, one jiao eight fen... All the values of the gold franc also decreased to nine jiao four fen, nine jiao... of silver dollars accordingly. From the above, we know that the price of international telegrams is based on the gold franc, not the national currency silver dollar. This is the big difference between international telegrams and domestic telegrams, and it is also the reason why international telegrams are expensive. To give an example, the price of sending a telegram from China to the United Kingdom in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic of China was 3.75 gold francs per word (one franc is equal to one hundred centimes), while the price in the spring of this year was 3.45 gold francs, which was 30 centimes lower than that of the year. However, the value of the gold franc in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic of China was five jiao of the national currency, so 3.75 francs only amounted to one yuan, eight jiao, seven fen and five li of the national currency, while the value of the gold franc in the spring of this year was one yuan of the national currency, so 3.45 francs must amount to two yuan, four jiao and five fen of the national currency, which is one yuan, five jiao and seven fen and five li higher than that of the spring of the 19th year. The situation of sending telegrams to other countries is also the same. In short, in recent years, although the Ministry of Communications has tried its best to lower the price of telegrams sent from my country to foreign countries, because of the relationship between gold price and exchange rate, the burden on the senders has increased instead of decreasing, which is really a helpless thing. Since January of this year, the silver price has been rising and the gold price has been falling. Although the pros and cons of this matter for my country's entire industry, commerce and finance are another issue, at least to a limited extent, the value of the gold franc has fallen accordingly. At the beginning of this year, the value of one gold franc was still one yuan of the national currency, but it was reduced to nine jiao and five fen on March 1st, and recently it was reduced to eight jiao and seven fen from June 1st, so the cost of international telegrams has been reduced by no less than 13% in half a year. This point is welcomed by the Ministry of Communications and the public who send international telegrams all over the country. Because on the one hand, the burden of telegram fees can be reduced for the senders of international telegrams, and on the other hand, although the telegram fee per word received by the Ministry of Communications for international telegrams has been reduced, it is hoped that the business will be more developed in the future. If the gold price continues to fall in the future, then the price of international telegrams can also be reduced! Silver Issues and Telecommunications Hao Since the United States raised the silver price, the drastic changes in the Sino-US exchange rate have been unprecedented. As a result, the silver price has skyrocketed and silver has flowed out, forming the tragic phenomenon of extreme financial panic at present. The recent cause is due to the increase in the silver price in the United States, and tracing the root cause should be attributed to the imbalance of international trade over the years. This can be seen in Mr. Ma Yinchu's recent article "Opinions on the Silver Problem." Mr. Ma said: "To protect the domestic silver, the only way is to balance international trade and solve the trade deficit. The trade deficit is the root cause of the current silver outflow, and the way to prevent the current silver outflow should be sought from this root cause, which has become a consensus of the whole country. Therefore, when it comes to China's silver problem, the conclusion must be transformed from the silver problem to the foreign trade problem." Mr. Ma's words are incisive and simple. Reducing imports and increasing exports is the only way to prevent the outflow of silver, and it is also the only way to fundamentally solve our country's economic panic. We deeply feel that the reason for the annual outflow of silver is that the purchase of telecommunications equipment and the sending of international telegrams are also considerable. Since the establishment of telecommunications, it has been more than 50 years, and all the main materials required have not yet been manufactured by ourselves, and we still have to rely on foreigners. According to the survey, the cost of purchasing this item by the Ministry of Communications is about 5 million yuan per year, and other expansion materials are not included. If the telecommunications equipment used in various provinces is included, the number is astonishing. As for the international telegram fees, because our country did not have self-operated and independent agencies for foreign communications in the past, all kinds of telegrams sent to foreign countries were transmitted by the water line company, so the international telegram fees in the whole country. About 8 million yuan per year fell into the hands of foreigners, and in the past 50 years, it has not been less than 400 million yuan. These two huge expenditures are nothing but good silver, and we watch it flow out without return, isn't it heartbreaking! Although, the telecommunications industry colleagues are not unable to manufacture various telecommunications equipment, but the strength is not enough, because the establishment of a telecommunications equipment factory requires a huge amount of money. Judging from the past telecommunications book revenue figures, it seems easy to handle this matter. However, the bulk of this number is occupied by the long-overdue military officer telegraph fees. Not to mention the remote ones, but from the military officer telegraph fees accumulated by the national military and political agencies since the establishment of the National Government to the end of the 23rd year, it has reached the huge amount of 22,106,510.0905 yuan. The telecommunications economy has been hit by this, and the plan to manufacture telecommunications equipment by itself cannot be put into practice! As a result, the principle of self-sufficiency has not been achieved, and the outflow of silver will never end. It is not an exaggeration to say that the military officer's telegraph arrears indirectly caused the outflow of silver in the telecommunications sector. As for the international lightning reports, since the Ministry of Communications established the International Radio Station in the 18th year, the leakage has gradually been recovered. Since this year, the internal equipment of the station has been expanded and improved, and the direct circuits have also been increased at the same time, so the business situation has progressed year by year. Recently, the monthly report fee income of the station has exceeded 400,000 yuan. In other words, the outflow of silver can be reduced by 5 million yuan per year. What are the disadvantages of silver outflow? There are serious and obvious facts presented before our eyes. We are suffering, it is really in deep water. Only by learning from the past and unifying from top to bottom can we try our best to find ways to prevent the outflow of silver from all aspects. At this time, we would like to sincerely point out two things we hope for: First, our telecommunications authorities and telecommunications colleagues are determined to seek self-sufficiency in telecommunications equipment, but because of economic difficulties, they are unable to do so, and the biggest reason for economic difficulties is due to the accumulation of military officer's telegraph fees. The military officer's telegraph fees are like a drop in the ocean compared to the entire military salary and political expenses, and the amount is extremely small. Mr. Zuo Jun has earnestly said in his article "The Future of Sichuan and Guizhou Telecommunications" in the 37th issue of this journal. We hope that our wise military and political authorities will understand the difficulties of telecommunications and strive to pay the report fees, then the telecommunications equipment in the future will have the possibility of being manufactured by ourselves, and the international situation is unpredictable. Once a war breaks out, the source of materials will be cut off, and the entire telecommunications traffic will inevitably be unable to maintain, which will have a huge impact on the future of national defense. Therefore, for the sake of national defense and transportation, we should plan for it early. And the way to plan is to enrich the telecommunications economy, and the way to enrich is to pay the military officer's telegraph fees. Second, although the international telegram fee has recovered about 400,000 yuan per month, the entire international telegram fee in the country is about 800,000 yuan to 900,000 yuan per month. The international radio station has only recovered half of it, and the other half is still obtained by foreigners. We sincerely hope that our patriotic people will be aware of the suffering imposed on us by the outflow of silver and deeply reflect on it. In the future, when sending international telegrams, they will unanimously specify that they be transmitted through wireless circuits that are fast, accurate, and economical, so as to protect national treasures and fulfill the national duty! A Message to the Highway Construction Authorities Hua Please Maintain the Telegraph Pole Lines The transmission of wired telecommunications must rely on the medium of conductors to reach from one end to the other. Therefore, any part of the conductor that has an obstacle will inevitably lead to the disruption of current and communication. The way to maintain it is to cooperate with each other. The maintenance and repair of the mechanical wiring installed indoors is certainly very easy. As for the overhead pole lines that stand in the wilderness, it is difficult to protect and maintain them due to the excessive distance. The Ministry of Communications has always made its greatest efforts to maintain the pole lines in order to avoid various man-made and natural infringements. For example, it has approved the Executive Yuan to formulate the rules for the maintenance of state-owned telegraph and telephone pole lines to prevent bandits from destroying them; it has banned the flying of kites near the power lines to avoid the entanglement of the power lines. It has sent workers to wipe the dust from the insulators to avoid leakage of the lines. All telecommunications bureaus that manage the lines must also conduct tests every morning to find out where the line problems are and know how to prevent them. If an obstacle occurs, workers will be sent immediately to repair it to minimize the time of communication disruption. However, this effort by the Ministry of Communications will be useless if any related party does not cooperate with it. The fact that telecommunications pole lines in various places have been damaged by road construction workers for no reason in recent years is one example. We all know that the opening of highways is generally very urgent. In order to speed up the construction, fires are often set to burn mountains and rocks, or explosives are used to blow them up. The telecommunications pole lines along the way will inevitably suffer. In addition, the workers who build highways are mostly recruited temporarily and have not been trained. They do not know how to maintain the pole lines along the way, and they often damage them for no reason during construction, considering it a common occurrence. If there is sufficient preparation in advance, it seems not difficult to find a way to solve it. When surveying the highway route, if the impact on the telecommunications pole lines along the way is taken into account, it can be moved and avoided immediately. If the road construction workers are given a little instruction in advance, they will not damage it for no reason and hinder communication. How can this be done by the highway authorities? The problem is extremely simple. Both telecommunications and highways are related to national defense. The close relationship between them is like the interdependence of lips and teeth. Without telecommunications equipment on highways, all construction progress and long-distance driving will experience great difficulties. Without the assistance of highways, it is difficult to survey and repair telecommunications pole lines. The Ministry of Communications has always supported the construction of highways in various provinces. For example, it has an agreement with the National Economic Commission on the cooperation of telephone on the Xilan Highway. It stipulates that when the long-distance car operating agency on the road uses long-distance telephones, it can pay half the usual fee. In order to facilitate the communication of long-distance cars in case of obstacles or temporary emergencies, anyone with a temporary telephone on the car can hook up and connect to the nearest station for communication in the middle. In order to facilitate the sending of telegrams by the engineering team, a telegraph operator is specially assigned to carry telegraph and telephone equipment and application materials to set up a temporary reporting room at the location of the engineering team. All of these are the actual manifestations of the Ministry of Communications' support for highway construction. We firmly believe that the highway authorities all over the country are committed to developing domestic transportation and must have the same view on the maintenance of telecommunications pole lines.

<h3 id="e154">Implementation of Industrial and Commercial Lending: Guarantee Loan Committee Established; Cai Zengji Elected Chairman; Direct Loans from Banks and Money Shops; Money Industry Loan Syndicate Approves Cash Collateral <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News reports: The Ministry of Finance, to implement the relief of industry and commerce, appointed Cai Zengji as chairman, Du Yuesheng and Wu Xingya as deputy chairmen, and Chen Guangfu and three others as committee members. Banks and money shops decided to maximize lending to relieve industry and commerce. Details as follows:</p>
<p>Guarantee Loan Committee Established</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance allocated 2,000 yuan in national treasury certificates, instructing Cai Zengji and others to receive and safeguard them, to serve as a secondary guarantee for banks and money shops to provide industrial and commercial relief loans according to the ten principles promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. On the afternoon of the 14th, at 1:00 PM, Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance, convened all committee members at the Zhong You Tian Restaurant on Sanma Road to discuss implementation matters. Those present included Vice Minister Xu, Cai Zengji, Wu Xingya, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Guangfu, Wang Yansong, Qin Runqing, Xi Demao, Zhang Peishen, Yu Zuoting, and Song Ziliang, totaling twelve people. Vice Minister Xu chaired the meeting, reporting that the purpose of this allocation of national treasury certificates was to provide relief loans to industry and commerce in the city, with banks and money shops directly providing the loans and the national treasury certificates serving as a secondary guarantee. The nature of this was purely a guarantee loan, not a loan account. After discussion, the following was decided: (1) Regarding the organization of the committee, there would be one chairman, two deputy chairmen, and four standing committee members. The above seven people would form the standing committee. (2) Cai Zengji was elected chairman, and Du Yuesheng and Wu Xingya were elected deputy chairmen. Chen Guangfu, Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, and Song Ziliang were elected standing committee members. (3) It was decided that on June 15th at 4:00 PM, a meeting would be held at the Bankers' Association to discuss the draft organizational charter prepared by the chairman. The meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting Discussed the Charter</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News reports: After the establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Relief Guarantee Loan Committee, a committee meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM at the Bankers' Club on Hong Kong Road. The committee members present included Cai Zengji, Wu Xingya, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Guangfu, Wang Yansong, Qin Runqing, Xi Demao, Zhang Peishen, Yu Zuoting, and Song Ziliang, totaling twelve people. Chairman Cai Zengji first reported on the proceedings of the first meeting on June 14th. Then, the draft charter of the Industrial and Commercial Relief Guarantee Loan Committee, prepared by the chairman, was discussed item by item, amended, and resolved. (1) After the chairman revises the draft, it will be submitted for approval at the meeting on June 17th at 2:00 PM. (2) The office will be temporarily located within the China National Goods Bank on Henan Road. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>National Goods Bank to Serve as Accountant</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from a committee member last night that the committee charter drafted by Chairman Cai Zengji is based on the ten principles promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. Factories manufacturing national goods and merchants selling national goods who wish to mortgage goods for loans may apply to the committee. After the committee reviews and approves the application, it will notify banks and money shops to provide the loans. The goods of the factories and merchants will serve as the first guarantee, and the national treasury certificates will serve as the second guarantee. All accounting matters will be handled by the China National Goods Bank.</p>
<p>Loan Syndicate Accepts Collateral</p>
<p>Xin Xin News reports: After the Ministry of Finance allocated the 24th year financial public bonds to relieve the money industry, money shops are submitting various deeds, public bonds, goods, and other collateral to the Money Industry Preparation Depository for review by the Money Industry Supervision Committee. According to Xin Xin News reporters, the supervision committee has completely reviewed all the collateral and calculated its value according to the prescribed pricing standards. Together with the previously reviewed 1,560,000 yuan, the total amounts to more than 24,460,000 yuan, which is only more than 240,000 yuan short of the 25 million yuan in financial public bonds. The various types of collateral approved by the Supervision Committee have also been approved by the Money Industry Loan Syndicate for acceptance as cash collateral.</p>
<p>Money Industry Loans Available for Withdrawal at Any Time</p>
<p>The more than 24,460,000 yuan in collateral from the money industry approved by the Supervision Committee has been accepted by the Money Industry Loan Syndicate as collateral for cash loans. As for the general loan methods, the Money Industry Joint Preparation Depository has notified all shops that they can withdraw funds from the syndicate at any time when needed. According to Xin Xin News reporters, as of 5:00 PM yesterday, only a small portion of the more than 24 million yuan in loans had been withdrawn. The banks and money shops are concentrating on centralized remittances. The results of daily settlements show that if a money shop needs to transfer funds to a bank, it will be deducted from the collateral.</p>
<p>Banks and Money Shops to Maximize Lending</p>
<p>The Shanghai money industry, due to the difficulties caused by remittance drawings, was relieved by the Ministry of Finance with the allocation of 25 million yuan in 24th year financial public bonds. After the implementation of centralized collection and resolution of remittance drafts between the two industries, the financial situation in southern Shanghai has stabilized. To maintain industry and commerce and revitalize the market, banks and money shops have now decided to maximize the provision of relief loans to industry and commerce. The Ministry of Finance has specifically allocated 20 million yuan in national treasury certificates as a secondary guarantee, while the collateral from factories and merchants serves as the first guarantee. Therefore, the repayment of principal is absolutely reliable, and both banks and money shops are happy to provide loans. As of the 15th, factories and merchants have submitted applications to the relevant National Goods Associations requesting loans amounting to more than 33 million yuan.</p>

<p>Huang Fu, Chairman of the Peiping Political Reorganization Committee, and Wang Kemin, the newly appointed Chief Advisor of the Tianjin Political Reorganization Committee and Mayor of Tianjin, are still in Shanghai and have no plans to return north. According to Xin Sheng News reporters, although both are staying in Shanghai, they continue to direct and handle North China political affairs through letters and telegrams, and there are frequent telecommunications between Tianjin, Beijing, and Chongqing. Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang telegraphed Huang Fu yesterday, reporting that peace and tranquility in Beiping is as usual and people are not afraid.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Today's Memorial: Premier's Guangzhou Assassination; Municipal Party Headquarters Meeting; Citywide Half-Mast Flag <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 13th anniversary of the Premier's assassination in Guangzhou. The Municipal Party Headquarters has designated 9:00 AM this morning to hold a memorial meeting at the Party Headquarters Auditorium on Fenglin Bridge, and has appointed Standing Committee member Wu Xingya as the chairman of the meeting. The Party Headquarters has also notified all agencies, schools, and organizations to send two representatives each to attend the meeting. The city will fly flags at half-mast. Military and police agencies have stepped up security for the day, as it coincides with the revolutionary memorial.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Impending Drought in Municipal and County Four Suburbs; Locust Nymphs Discovered in Pudong and Nanhui <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Da Gong News reports: The farmland in this city, including Shanghai South, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Pudong, Wusong, Zhenru, Guxing, Fahua, Pusong, Gaoxing, Yangsi, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, Yinxiang, Tangqiao, Caojing, Longhua, and other 17 districts, averages 40,000 mu per district, so the total farmland area of the city is approximately 680,000 mu. Among them, rice paddies account for 40%, cotton fields account for 50%, and other fields such as vegetable and fruit fields account for 10%. Cotton plants are growing unevenly due to the drought, with only about 30-40% growth per mu. Since sowing, the rice seedlings have been weak and fragile due to lack of rain. Although irrigated, the soil is cracked and withered under the scorching sun. The water in the ponds and swamps near the fields recedes several feet from the embankment during high tide and becomes shallow again after the tide recedes. If there is no heavy rainfall before the summer solstice, the disaster will be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Due to the prolonged drought in Pudong and Nanhui counties, the rice seedlings sown by farmers are growing on dry land. In addition, the hot weather has led to the discovery of locust nymphs densely populating the fields. After the farmers reported to the county government, they were instructed to order farmers in the four suburbs to dig trenches to drive the locust nymphs into the trenches and drown or burn them. According to the county government's investigation, the number of locust nymphs in each township reached more than 200 dan. Fortunately, they were discovered early, and the rice seedlings have not yet suffered a major attack.</p>
