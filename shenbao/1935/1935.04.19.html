<p>— 彥</p>
<p>自美國實施購銀政策。人爲的提高銀價以來。國際間之貨幣戰爭。益趨尖銳。而我國存銀乃源源流出。造成空前之白銀巨額出超。雖賴政府之實行白銀出口稅與平衡稅。得告遏北。第以存銀銳减。社會不無恐慌。信用收縮。銀根奇緊。至上屆大結束之前夕。恐慌之深刻。景象之悽慘。更爲民元以來所僅見。因是數月以來。銀錢兩業一致緊縮放。欵以保實力。而準備未來困難之應付。然而國貨工商業。旣飽受外貨貶價傾銷之影饗。至此復感周轉調劑之痛苦。市面頓告呆滯。商貨失其流通。而失業問題。亦加深其嚴重。如此不景氣象。當非國貨工業前途之福。本市國貨廠商及國貨各國體有鑒及此。特起共謀自救。組織聯合市塲。國貨大同盟。及市民國貨服用同盟等團體。進行互助自救運動。並從事於改良出品。及門市批發賣價之劃一。暨國外貿易之發展等各項問題之研究。其用心可謂良苦。惟以我人觀察。已往之提倡國貨。其方法似未臻完美。敢就愚見所及。一爲陳之。</p>
<p>我國之提倡國貨運動。由來已久。惟就巳往之情形觀察。旣乏通盤之計劃。又無一定之鵠的。一般意見。以爲凡屬國砟。皆當提倡。而國貨廠商亦不過利用機會。以推銷其出品。一旦風行。乃不惜偷工减料以圖厚利。而不顧國貨信用之墮失。因之提倡國貨之論調。雖已一再高唱。而語其成效。則尙微渺。竊以爲提倡國貨運動。不啻爲救中國之唯一良劑。用而得當。則可起死回生。否則其效果不過興奮於一時。而徒爲少數廠商製造機會而已。須知我國近年雖兢兢於提倡國貨。而洋貨進口銷行。反有增而無減。悲觀者流。乃歸罪於國貨運動之失敗。實則洋貨之進口。其種類已今昔不同。卽以布疋一項而論。民國初年進口。尙以粗布爲大宗。而近年則以社會風尙之轉變。與夫我國產品之通銷。已易組布而爲細布及毛紡織品之一類。由此觀之。我人若大聲疾呼於國產粗布之提倡。而不謀細布及毛紡織品大量進口之挽救。其成效之鮮。殆可臆測。是故提倡國貨。必需於洋貨之進口情形先有透澈之研究。而後擇其要者。分別緩急。逐一提倡。其已有代替品者。則宜計劃技術上之改善。謀成本之减輕。並協助其推銷。至其目前尙無代替品者。更應急起直迫。集全國才力。分工研究。以謀仿造。而引起投資之興趣。若本此方針。每年提倡數種。積以時日。則不特成效可觀。而國貨之基礎。亦可望鞏固。語云「百年樹人。」我以爲提倡國貨之完成。亦非有此特久之精神。殊不爲功也。</p>

<p>— 德國通訉</p>
<p>雙方談判未見效果　德法衝突尙難調解</p>
<p>為舉世所注目的英德談判、終於在三月二十四日實現了、英外相西門偕外次亞丁正式訪問柏林、這是國社黨人自從執政以後第一次得到英國紳士的賞識、要是在兩年以前、大不列巓外相以元首之禮謁見希特勒、而且進行兩國間的談判、一定會被認為奇聞、這情形彷彿等於十年前的慕索列尼、三年前的斯太林、世界眞變得太快了、使英國的政治家都不能不變更傳統的紳士態度、為什麼希特勒早晚時價不同呢、兩年前、不獨他被人家看做是一位丑角、最重要的、德國沒有實力的後盾、今天呢、希特勒固然仍是希特勒、但德國的軍備已經趕上法國了、我們知道、國際間並沒有什麼「正義」「公理」等等、有的就是「强權」、「强權」勝於一叨、</p>
<p>據英國官方公佈、西門等一行的任務、是根據二月三日的倫敦協定、討論的範圍也以這個協定為基礎、疏通德法間的意見、鞏固歐洲的和平、但經過三月十六日德國政府的實行徵兵制、公開重整軍備、這個「當心砲」的結果、法國的態度就轉而抱怨英國、接着西門就表示、他的訪問柏林、只含採詢德國政府的意見、作為將來解决整個歐洲問題的初步、並不是英國單獨對德行動、在英德間更不會有直接訂定條約的趨勢、這總算暫時緩和了法國的威嚇——「否則、我們（法國）到莫斯科去」的口號、</p>
<p>法國報紙、在西門行前、就表示「空走一趟何必」、西門自己也感到明知沒有什麼希望、不過為了「和平」、不得不走走看、可見德法雙方所提出的條件、都十分苛刻、要使某方面屈服、西門此日還沒有這種力量、經過先後兩日在柏林的直接談話、西門就按預定的行程回到倫敦去了、英德雙方的官方公告、都認為此次談判大有效果、可是什麼效果呢、據西門表示、他對於希特勒有一個極愉快的印像、另一方面對於德國的要求、已有充分的明瞭、這眞是第一流外交家的口吻、</p>
<p>許多人覺得德國有著名的軍人、沒有特出的外交家、這是對的、希特勒充滿着武夫氣槪、無外交家風度、這也是對的、但是德國有一點、恰同日本蘇俄一樣、不獨知道以武力作外交後盾、而且更懂得利用時機、譬如說、希特勒的說話與李維諾夫的說話、正是一個反比例、可是同樣的能够使英國人頭痛、就因為說話人的背後有着不可侮的實力、據說此次當希特勒西門談話到奧國獨立問題時、希特勒曾說、為什麼英國自已不來在這個「不干涉條約」上簽字呢、這種說話、自然違反外交上的慣例、可惜我們不知道西門如何回答、否則對照起來、一定更有趣、總之據外交界所傳出的消息、此次希特勒對於各種問題的態度，都說得十分堅决而痛快、把西門直截了當駁了一頓、為的大家互相舌戰的結果、公婆各自有道理、所以還是同沒有談判前一樣、雙方毫無接近的可能、西門所說的、他對於希特勒有個極愉快的印像、倘若是指此而言、那末、紳士的態度、到底不是我們常人所能够猜破的了、</p>
<p>此次談判的中心問題、有下列的幾種、（一）東歐協約、英國態度是根據倫敦協定、將各種條約、東歐·多瑙·航空·三協約連在一起、德國則主張分開、特別是對於東歐恊約、認為沒有簽約的可能、德國不願意同蘇俄連在這個條約中去、而束縛了自己、對於這點、德報更表示得十分堅决、認定德國在西部邊界上沒有問題、可是東部却不就這麼馬虎、一定要有一種公平的解决方法才行、（二）多瑙協約、德國雖不根本反對、但提出一個條件、就是對於「不干涉」須加個切實的定義、這就是說、德國不准干涉奧國、但別的國家（指意大利）也不准干涉、而且要英國在這上面做個保證人、（三）航空恊約、本是英國調停德法衝突、對德讓步的條約、德國自然贊成、不過德國仍有個附帶條伴、要求空軍的平等權、（四）回到國聯去、德國認為只要德國完全得到軍備平等權以後、就隨時都可以重歸日內瓦去、而英國却認為先回到日內瓦、然後大家再在國聯中去討論一種辦法、（五）取消徵兵制、英國希望德國政府先自動取消徵兵制、然後大家再共同商量一種切實裁軍的辦法、限制各國的兵額、德國對於此點、認為毫無妥協的餘地、（六）訂立條約問題、英國主張將各種條約合在一起、不應單獨分開、和平的基礎就建立在這上面、德國則主張要先個別訂立條約、並且希望英德間立卽成立一種英德協約、然後才旁及其他、（七）軍備問題、英國主張德國的軍備最少也要縮减到在法國現有的軍力以下、相反的、德國主張、德國的軍備須與蘇俄平等、</p>
<p>綜合上面的各種問題、我們就會看出英德雙方名人都固守自己的陣地、絲毫不肯讓步、一位瑞士記者說得好、英德談判有結果嗎、有的、假如沒有這一次談判、那末兩國的要人們、就無機會彼此聯絡友誼、互相暢談、此外、彼此也不能够利用餘暇於聚餐時坐在一起、要人們的友誼、不是很需要的麼、我們還能够有什麼要求、</p>
<p>其實、這一些問題、大部分都還是表面文章、所謂條約呀·國聯呀·軍縮呀·等等、無非是一種外交把戲、在我們外行人看來、他們大家鬧得有聲有色、所以很容易會被他們瞞過、以爲這一批先生眞的爲了「條約」在爭執、可惜事實上就不是這麼一回事、譬如說、東歐協約吧、那是法俄擺下陣勢、以法俄兩國的兵力做後盾、萬一德國向某一方面進攻時、兩國就「名正言順」地出兵前後夾攻、再如多瑙協約吧、就是法國承認意大利在奧國的特殊地位、倘若一旦德國勢力再侵入奧境時、大家就聯合起來、以武力制止、德國自然不情願自己套上了人家劃好的環套、給別人出兵來打自己的口實、於是鬧來鬧去、大家就在「條約」上大做文章、至於他們的本意、換一句話說、法國想維持現狀、因之用種種方法、去束縛德國、德國想打破現狀、於是就步步與法國的政策、針鋒相對、最後的一條路、自然大家只有用實力解决、</p>
<p>此次柏林談判的結果、英國顯然得不到什麽便宜、不單是德法間的矛盾無法調和、就反俄戰綫、也因法國的反對——法報曾於西門在柏林時發出警告的論調、法國堅决反對無論間接或直接反對蘇俄的計劃、並德國過大的要求似乎有希望的成分也不多、所以在英國的立塲上說來、眞是空走一趟、</p>
<p>至於德國的態度、仍是實事求是、一步步做下去的、自從西門來到柏林以後、德國反俄的空氣突然更加濃厚起來、各方都十分熱心地討論蘇俄的軍備、認為德國東部已是一個危險地帶、蘇俄强有力的紅軍、足以威嚇德國的安全、德國為自衛起見、有與蘇俄軍備平等的必要、這就是說、德國所要求的、巳不是只五十萬常備軍、與法國平等卽認為滿足、而是進一步準備擴充到百萬的數目、在實力上將要與蘇俄相等了、這不只法國嚇了一跳、就是老練的外交家如英外相西門、大約也不能不皺眉頭吧、</p>
<p>對於目前歐洲這種局面、焦急的人自然不是德國、德國兩年來已經有了充分的準備、他只靜待時局的發展而已、「反俄戰爭」、大約就沒有法國的反對、德國自己也得考慮一下、大軍深入蘇俄境內、而事先沒有將捷克波蘭兩國解决淸楚、事實上自然困難、另一方面、究竟波捷兩國對於德國有切身的利害、而且又是近隣、德國為什麼要舍近圖遠呢、此外德國國防軍幹部與蘇俄紅軍幹部歷來就有密切的合作、德國現任國防部部長勃龍堡將軍、所以得到部長這個位置、據說純粹因他與蘇俄紅軍有良好關係的緣故、假如我們撇開主義不談、那末在地理上、未來戰爭中德國還需要蘇俄的帮忙、而且聽說、歐戰時德名將魯登道夫將軍有任參謀總長的消息、那末反俄與聯俄在黨與軍隊之間、也許有不同的意見了、法國人看出這個危機、所以賴伐爾表示、無論德國加入與否、法國决定與蘇俄先進行東歐公約、這自然就等於法俄訂立軍事同盟、倘若這計劃眞的實現時、那德國在軍事上就處在兩面夾攻的形勢下、發展就不大容易的了、目下德國反俄的空氣、也許另有作用、否則、多年來德軍事專家所費的許多心血、恐怕不會有實現的機會了、因為法國强有力的助手、旣不是英國也不是意大利、而是蘇俄、蘇俄在未來戰爭中可以左右德法兩國、倘若反俄戰綫果然失敗、那末蘇俄在歐洲的政治地位將愈見重要了、</p>
<p>在四月十一日英法意三國外交家又决定會晤於北意斯特里薩地方、討論對德問題、照已往的經騐告訴我們、這個會議也不會有多大結果的、英法意各人的利害不同、又有什麼法子連成一氣呢、</p>
<p>在這中間、値得注意的、就是立陶宛在米美爾訟案中、居然判决了四位米美爾國社黨首頒以死刑、這曾引起德國劇烈的反對、論理、立陶宛是個小國、怎敢以、螳臂當車」、觸怒德國、他態度旣然敢這麼强硬、那末事情就不見得十分單純的了、此外小協約國並巴爾幹同盟、也準備在羅馬尼亞首都開會、他們的目的、自然在討論一種對付德國的辦法、</p>
<p>歐洲的戰雲日近、我們所不能够知道的、只是爆發的時日而已、（三月二十八日於德國）</p>

<p>嗣經行政院議决、令飭冀省府將該局長孫慶澤撤職查辦、並電令按照黃災會工賑組所擬四項救濟辦法、由冀河務局負責堵築、黃河水利會督同堵合、黃災會監視進行、當時以口門附近、均漫沒水中、爰自其來源貫台地方、先行堵塞、甫冀河務局擬訂計劃、　黃災會工賑組及黃河水利會核定、限河務局新局長滑德銘、於一個月堵合完工、此工賑組未移歸全國經濟委員會水利委員會以前情形也、</p>
<p>决口險恶情形</p>
<p>及本年二月、該組移浦水利委員會管轄後、當據報稱、截至上年十二月十八日、將七百八十一公尺口門、進占僅剩六十四公尺、當時水勢甚平、搶堵尙易、而該河務局滑局長德銘、託詞購運料物、未能依限齊集、只得停工以待、雖經工賑組竭力恊助、代為徵運料物、指示進堵方針、促其趕速進行、依限完成工事、乃催者言諄令切、而延者置若罔聽、遂將廢曆冬至節前·及本年新平廢曆年前、三次堵合良機、皆予誤過、且據冀建牕先後呈報、滑局長每日工作報告情形、僅有某掃占進加高若干公尺、並無潰蟄情報、及蒞工視察、始悉所報工程、一半屬於搶加、其疊經潰蟄情形、則迄禾據實明報、當准滑局長德銘辭職、另派齊壽安洽充、而斯時口門刷深、巳至二十九公尺、奪全河流量百分之八十、工情日趨危險、堵築愈感為難、此蓋冀省先後辦理河務工作人員玩忽廷誤、遂致工情險惡之情形也、</p>
<p>貫台合龍經過</p>
<p>經委會鑒於工情之險惡、堵築之艱難、爭權倘不統一、必致貽誤要工、以孔主任祥榕前在馮樓堵口、具有成績、就熟駕輕、仍令該主任依照工振組辦法、專負其責、辦理貫台補救工程、組下設工程處、以冀省河務局齊局長籌安為處長、並電飭從速邀集黃河水利委員會·冀魯豫三省建設廳長·河務局長·會務補救辦法、當經决定採用桃溜落淤方法、趕行堵合、一面商由財政部撥給工欵、以應急需復邀請中外專家多人、前赴工次實地考察、研究標本兼治之策、自孔主任負責主持以後、先後據報調遺人員、支配工作、運購柳石、徵集舟車、昕夕從公、始終不懈、物料方面、旣獲適應工需、工程方面、則於東西兩壩、預下柳石枕、並隨蟄隨廂、得以屢危復安、兼於上游及靠近口鬥、施做柳壩移溜落淤、在口門內下石枕護底、迨兩壩用石枕保護至相當穩固程度、即相機施以棗核枕壩堵辦法合龍、旋於本月文日、據電貫台口門慶於十一日辰合龍、計自該主任孔祥榕負責專辦貫台工程、共祇二十餘日、任勞任怨奮勇從公、竟將氣至二十九公尺之水口門、堵塞合龍、以上慰政軫念民瘼之至意、此該會竭力補救、幸獲合龍之情形也、</p>
<p>標本兼求預計</p>
<p>顧前者總合該會所派中外專家、前赴工次察勘報告、及各方所報情形、詳加研究、咸認為該項工程、能否堵合、殊難預料、蓋以黃河水勢、與一般河流不同、其害不獨流量過大、尤在合沙過多、隨處沉澱、遷徙靡常、下流河床、積年增高、以致宣洩不暢、决口因而愈頻、堵築益感困難、倘能於上游山谷築塌蓄水、下流低地另闢新道、一面培修金堤·及沿河三省大堤、以資防範、水患或可稍减、當又責令黃河水利委員會委員畏李儀祉、趕於大汛期前迅將金堤培修完固、一面鑒於冀魯豫三省大堤年丸失修、又曾分電黃河水利委員會冀魯豫三省省政府、對於三省大堤修防各端、務應及早籌計、會商妥辦、並仍邀集中外專家澈底研究、庶使歷來引爲巨患之黃災、得以减免、沿河各省數千萬肘產、俱獲保全、此黃河水災標本兼治之預計也、</p>
<p>共費四十五萬</p>
<p>近准監察院于院長所派監視委員電稱、貫台合龍情形甚佳、此後加高培厚、尙須努力、俾竟全功、此次合龍之迅速、實以經濟充足、事權統一、故能收事半功倍之效、至關於工程經費、　　主任祥榕接辦補救工程以後、共由祥熙撥發四十五萬元、工竣之後、當由該主任負責報銷、以重公帑、所有黃河貫台口門堵築合龍、曁種種經過困難情形、理合報請公鑒、（中央社）</p>

<p>京訊、中國美術會理事長張道藩、十四日晚在中央廣播臺播音演講、題爲「中國美術會與現代中國美術」、原詞如次、</p>
<p>「首都有一個中國美術會的設立、知道的人固然很多、恐怕較遠的地方同胞、沒有知道的還是不少、現在利用這最短的時間、給大家一個簡單的報告、</p>
<p>中國美術會是由南京·上海·北平·各地數十個美術家發起於民國二十二年總理誕辰的一天、在南京正式成立、到現在已經是有一年半的歷史了、成立以後、各地美術家入會者很踴躍、到現在已經有會員二百餘人、二十三年九月十五日、曾在南京舉行成立紀念展覽會、各地美術家出品者很多、本年內决定舉行春秋兩季展覽會、春季展覽會、巳定於本日（十四）舉行預展、明日（十五）正式開幕、現在簡單的報告此次籌備的情形、此次展覽會徵求作品、在二月內已登通告、原來定於本月五日截止收件、以後因為各省由郵局寄來參加的作品、因路途遙遠、不能按期到達、故特別延長至本月十一日截止、以致於一切佈置手續、均於十二三兩日趕辦守畢、故異常忙碌、關於佈置方面、雖較以往的展覽會有進步、但本會同仁、仍覺未能滿意、還望各界原諒、</p>
<p>總計此次收到書法國畫油畫金石雕塑等作品大小共一千多件、以出品地點論、有河南·上海·北平·天津·廣州·江蘇·浙江·福建·廣東·河北·江西·雲南·四川·陝西·山西·貴州·等十七八省市、以作家論、有陳樹人·高劍父·徐悲鴻·王祺·茹欲立·李毅公·諸聞韻·陳之佛·洪陸東·張書旗·劉小僧·汪東·張小樓·謝公展·趙少昂·汪亞塵·張　光·俞寄凡·許士騏·潘玉良·高樂宜·龍文·高希舜·章毅然·李金髮·周伯敏·潘天授·孫福熙·陳了淸·潘博山·管一得·楊瘦濤·柳子谷·黃少强·黃少收·姜丹靑·周珍蓀·楊縵華·蕭謙中·田桓·吳茀之·朱屺瞻·廬世候·梁鼎銘·楊寄虹·張　禹·王誠哉·王承齋·滕白也·黃鴻圖·蔣兆和·王臨乙·等等二百餘人、此次各地作家這樣踴躍的參加、實在是很好的現象、不過本會最抱歉的、就是竹都華僑招待所的會塲太小、不能全數陳列、所以檢擇的結果、只能陳列三百六十來件、其餘的作品、不能不忍痛割愛了、對這一件事、現在就便鄭重的聲明一句、就是說未能陳列的作品、不能說都是不及格落選的、受會塲太小的限制、不能多陳列、是一原因、來件到遲了、未能列入、又一原因、來件太大或過長或過小、不便張　或陳列、又一原因、未裝框子或未裱好、不便陳列、又一原因、大家知道這種情形、無論出品者本人或諸位觀衆、想必能够原諒本會了、</p>
<p>大家都知道美術的發展、於一國的文化、關係甚大、過去百餘年來中國美術、似乎一天一天的沒落下去、牠所占世界文化重要地位、幾乎已經動搖、這給我們現在注意文化愛好美術努力美術的人一個重大的警惕、推其原因、不外以往一般美術家無良好的組織、以資合作、政府或社會、未能盡量的提倡或扶助、本會之設、就是希望補以往無組織的缺憾、本會成立以後、各地美術家之踴躍參加、可以證明合作非不可能、在中央及政府方面、除已决定在南京建築中央博物院而外、上月並且巳經决定在首都建築一個美術陳列館、這是國家對美術重視提倡及扶助的證明、社會方面、近年來也增了不少的提倡和扶助的熱情、</p>
<p>這都是於中國美術前途很可慶幸的、本會現在最誠懇希望的、是（一）全國各地美術家共同努力精誠合作、（二）中央政府或地方政府、多多提倡扶助、（三）社會人士及愛好美術者、特別重視、特別贊助、使此後中國美術家的作品、得相當的出路、生活得着最低限度的維持、而增加各作家努力的勇氣、使中國美術、因此得於二十世紀中、造成偉大的成績、穩定中國美術在世界文化上所佔重要的地位、本會同仁、願竭其忠誠、盡其智能、在中央政府提倡之下、社會人士扶助之下、與全國美術家精誠合作努力前進、」</p>

<p>學生答詞</p>
<p>各代表演說畢、卽由大夏大學江念劬致答詞云、今日來此參加學生國貨年推行聯合會宣誓典禮、比聞各位先生訓話、不禁發生不少感想、回憶過去、吾人於生活中、自早至晚、不能與洋貨脫離關係、以致每年入超驚人、受列强經濟侵略、致國家元氣、日趨低落、設不卽起振足自救、國家前途、何堪設想、今日學生國貨年、在此舉行宣誓、凡吾學生、自卽日起、應積極提倡國貨、使家庭社會、完全國貨化、設能如此、國家方有希望、次由交通大學尹保泰演說云、在過去幾年中、提倡國貨的結果、每年入超、逐漸增加、這不能不歸過於提倡者的不力、與一般國人之不知自愛、須知提倡國貨、非僅開會·呼口號·貼標語·所能收效、提倡者必先以身作則、身體力行、不避毀譽、切實提倡、要知人家毀我、其用意為策勵我人繼續努力、不能謂為破壞、然而失敗是成功之母、吾人應本總理革命精神、再接再厲、百折不回、吾深信必能收效、今日在此宣誓、應依照宣誓的話、努力去幹、須知提倡國貨、為救國救民唯一方法、繼由民立女子中學楊麗珍答詞云、今日為學生宣誓禮、凡屬學生、應自今日起、致力國貨之提倡、方不負宣誓本意、末由鐵華小學代表陳亞儒演說云、吾國自與列强通高以來、舶來品年趨增加、其原因皆以國人喜新奇。愛摩登、以致國力日衰、設長此以往、國家將趨於滅亡、今年學生國貨年、學生應羣起實行、方可收取實效、切實提倡、以完成其使命、國計民生、實利賴之、</p>

<p>昨晨九時許、法租界顯煦路邁而西愛路轉角滬上最負盛名經理福特等汽車之美通汽車公司門口、發生一圖綁未遂案、被綁者卽係美通公司之機械師、當時幸肉栗之汽車夫及一外籍銅匠之機警、狂呼捕盜、結果來匪四人中被探捕追及、當塲擊斃一匪、三匪兎脫、肉票得機脫險、茲將詳情探錄如後、</p>
<p>家世職業</p>
<p>甬人史久榮、年三十二歲、前卒業於本埠聖約翰大學、曾留學美國、在米西根大學、得有機械科碩士學位、歸國後、卽在亞爾培路信通汽車公司任職、迄至今年、始由信通而轉入美通、史家住滬西愚園路二七五號、置有自備租界第九七六號啡色別克轎車以代步、雇用汽車夫名李阿林、</p>
<p>綁匪登車</p>
<p>史於昨晨起身後、略加盥洗進食後、時已九時、史以已屆辦公時間、乃命李阿林將車開出、史登入車內、直駛公司、詎車甫抵公司門口、汽車夫方將車煞停、史正俯身扭轉門鈕之際、突由車後躍上綁匪四人、兩着藍布短裝、兩御藍布長衫、先由三匪擁入史之車廂、分坐於史之左右、出槍示禁、</p>
<p>無法開車</p>
<p>另一匪卽坐入前面車廂、與車夫李阿林並坐、先將李　頰二下、令李將坐位讓開、該匪卽擬自行司機、當時李已見勢不妙、已事先將「暗開」扭閉、故待該匪擁上時、引擎已無法開啟、匪等正在手忙脚亂之際、適有公司門口之司閽印捕見史車駛到、當卽從容上前、欲代為扭開車門、蓋該捕當時尙不知車內有四匪失在也、</p>
<p>俄人大呼</p>
<p>但當時匪等見印捕走來、疑係拘捕、內中一匪卽出槍對準該捕轟擊一響、命中該捕左脛、槍聲一響、驚動站立咫尺之俄籍銅匠佛來克、見狀大驚、遂以華語大呼捉强盜、比時衆匪尙欲徼倖成功、且命李阿林迅速開車、但李徉作無法、匪等至此、知事難成、急一擁下車、分頭逃竄、</p>
<p>華捕追趕</p>
<p>兩匪自邁而西愛路向巨籟達路飛逃、另兩匪則自福煦路向亞爾培路奔逸、惟其時佛來克不肯輕捨、且追且呼一匪情急、返身連發二槍、幸均未命中、其時適有公共租界第二八二號華捕駕駛機器脚踏車經過該處、聞聲趕到、加入尾追、</p>
<p>一匪格斃</p>
<p>該捕等追抵西摩路亞爾培路附近、遙見一匪在前奔逃、乃　槍轟擊、同時法捕房第三四九號華捕、亦加入協捕、結果一匪後背命中兩彈、洞穿前胸、當塲身死、該匪身穿藍布長衫、內襯短棉襖黑布褲、手槍一支、尙緊執手中、隨由法捕房大批探捕趕到、先將死匪車送同仁輔元堂報候第二特院檢騐、一面偵緝同黨歸案訊辦、</p>
<p>素無資產</p>
<p>嗣據記者探悉、史君任職美通公司除任工程師外、僅以兜攬為業務、並無資產、亦無積蓄、平時待人接物、和藹誠摯、無結怨於人之處、此次事件之起因、想係出於誤會也、</p>

<p>— 陳立夫</p>
<p>—全國讀書運動大會之開幕詞—</p>
<p>中國文化建設協會於四月八日至二十一日、舉行全國讀書運動大會、該會理事長陳立夫先生請理事張道藩先生代表、於八日上午八時、在南京中央廣播電臺、播送全國讀書運動大會之開幕詞、其演講要點、係立夫先生所指示、事後其演詞經整理發表、全文如次、</p>
<p>諸君、今天是中國文化建設協會主辦的全國讀書運動大會的第一日、願將舉辦這全國讀書運動大會的重要意義、報告給全國親愛的同志同胞、我們現在大家都痛感民族地位的杌臲、國家情勢的危殆、以為在這千鈞一髮之時、民族復興運動實為現在每一個國民應有之自覺、應有之自信、應有之自奮、年來中央於軍事·政治·黨務·敎育·各方面的設施、都楚根基於民族復興運動這一個大前提而出發的、不過、我們更深信、一個民族的强弱盛衰、完全基於文化的是否昌盛、所以我們在民族復興運動的前夜、應該有一個轟轟烈烈的切切實實的文化復興運動、以文化復興運動、奠定民族復興運動深厚而堅固的基礎、而且唯有文化復興運動能成功、民族復興運動才能不徒託空言、才能如期實現、</p>
<p>我們要復興文化、先應該要有一個先决條件、這先决條件就是在如何恢復民族建設文化之自信始、假定一般人對於建設文化之自信力都沒有、那麼眞是所謂「哀莫大於心死」、還有什麼希望可言呢、所謂自信者、就是有諸己之謂也、更切實一點解釋、就是先須具有自知之明、中國人的老毛病、不妄自誇大、便妄自菲薄、這過與不及的毛病、就是使中國民族不能長進的最大原因、在文化方面說、妄自誇大的人、便主張極端復古、妄自菲薄的大、便主張全盤西化、這兩種各走極端的主張、不僅於中國文化、絕無裨益、反蓋足使我國走入更混亂更黑暗的境地、所以我我們復興民族文化之態度、應該不妄目誇、亦不妄自菲薄、而以自立自助之精神、取人之長、補己之短、建設一個世界上最健全的新文化、同時更須盡已之長、貢獻他人、以表揚我們民族固有的特性、</p>
<p>為了達到這上述的目的、我們對於過去現在和將來、都應該確定其應持之態度、我國在世界歷史上、其文化光芒尤丈、無與倫比、此爲絕對不能否認的事實、縱橫數萬里、上下數千年、有多少聖哲英豪發揮他的智能、建樹他的功業、為中國民族爭光榮、然而近百年來、因物質之不如人、缺乏自衛的力量、對外戰爭、屢告失敗、民族權益、日益喪失、於是一般人民都走上了頹廢喪氣的歧途、以為我們中國什麼都不如人、過去祖宗所流傳下來的遺產、什麼都不足留戀、其實、這眞是一個重大的謬誤、要知道我們的聰明才力並不在任何優秀民族之下、而歷史上種種學術制度之闡揚與創建、更非任何人所能抹煞、所以我們為建立民族嶄新而健全的文化計、對於過去的文化、决不宜純持厭棄的態度、應該積極的以科學方法、將吾族先民固有智能所積聚的一切文物、加以整理、取其所當取、捨其所當捨、固有文化經過科學方法整理之後、始能披沙揀金成為有用之物、光輝燦爛、用之不盡、</p>
<p>我國今日所以陷於次殖民地之地位、自有其歷史上之因緣、也由於　今一船人民心理上之自殺、因爲一種健全文化之建立、旣重於精神文化之發揚、亦重於物質文化之創造、我國過去之文化、偏重於精神方面、歐美之文化、偏重於物質方面、所以中西接觸以後、西洋的洋槍大砲衝毀了古老的長城、我國囚物質之不如人、於是喪權失地、恥痕斑斑、假定一般人民、能及早自覺、研究其失敗之點、奮發其自救之道、那麼近百年來的中國歷史、决不致至今日而猶瘡痍滿目、最可痛心的、就是自鴉片戰爭以後、中國的知識份子竟喪失了自信力、中國整個的民族、失却了自信力這一個立國的寳貝、於是時代的車輪前進不已、徒造成了我國每况愈下的局面、我國文化偏重於精神方面之發展、這個是歷史上之因緣、中國人民喪失了自信力之寳貝、却又是人民心理上之自殺、到了現在、中國的智識份子是怎樣呢、有沒有覺悟呢、許多人還是消極頹廢度着浪漫的生活、對於民族之盛衰、國家之存亡、竟把着冷觀的態度、不認淸國家民族的病根、不透視現代中國社會所需要奮鬥的途徑、如果人人如此、中國如何會有希望呢、所以我們决不能抱着消極的冷觀態度、應該恢復民族的自信力更應該認識缺乏物質文化之現代中國、是需要科學智識去充實、以提高社會文化的水準、</p>
<p>對於過去的文化、能切實加以整理、對於現在的需要、能切實加以充實、把垂危的民族從根救起來、但我們决不能以此為滿足、須知民挨的生命、我們不僅應盡維持之責、綿延其生命、尤應發揚光大、為全世界全人類而服務、我們要達到這偉大的目的、克盡這神聖的使命、我們便要以科學精神去發揚光大民族的生命、以科學方法整理過去的一切、以科學智識充實現在的一切、以科學精神創造將來的一切、這就是中文化復興運動中三大工作、也就是建設中國民族文化的三大路綫、我們要完成這檢討、（整理過去、把握（充實）現在、創造將來的工作、就應該從、（一）好學、（二）力行、（三）知恥、這三項做起、</p>
<p>好學者、以智識與人競爭也、現代的世界、是智力角逐的世界、智力强者勝、智力弱者敗、其間存亡之道、决無僥倖之可言、我們要以科學方法整理過去的一切、要以科學智識充實現在的一切、要以科學精神發揚將來的一切、在在須以極大的智能應付、智能訓練與培養、便在乎好學、力行者、以能力與人競爭也、我國人民受「知之匪艱行之維難」之毒、由來已久、百舉皆廢一事無成的原因、就在不能力行之故、所以我們應該本着孫中山先生知難行易的精神努力幹去、復興文化之道在乎此、復興民族之道也在乎此、知恥者、補足某知識能力之不足、以備雪恥之用也、語云、「知恥近乎勇」、我們有知恥的自覺、便應該有雪恥之準備、雪恥的準備、在於補足其智能之不足、所以能補足其智能之不足、便是知恥的明證、苟人人能好學、那麼外人所知者、我人無所不知、人人能力行、那麼外人所能行者、我人無所不能、人人知恥、則智能皆充、國恥隨時可雪、國靴隨時可蘇、個個人民、都能脚踏實地、切實從「好學」「力行」「知恥」這三項做去、我深信文化復興運動的成功、民族復興運動的成功、是指日可期的、</p>
<p>靑年是國家的靈魂、民族的中堅、國家的强弱、民族的盛衰、是決定於青年的意志及其努力的方向的、我們唯有希望現代在學的靑年、充分刺用在學的時間、業餘的靑年、充分利用業餘的時間、不僅靑年、其他幼年莊年、老年、都能向「好學」「力行」「知恥」三項做去、那麼中國民族的發揚光大、造成世界上第一等文明大國决不成問題的、中國文化建設協會舉辨的讀書競進會以後從今天起舉行的全國讀書運動大會的意義、就在乎、我們以最大的期望、最高的熱誠、希望全國同志同胞都來參加這讀書運動、達到把中國民挨「從根救起來迎頭幹上去」的目的、</p>
<p>鑒於國家地位之危殆、而空言救國、是沒有效力的、救國大業、不在空談、而在實行、更應該從自身做起、從自身做起為最切實也最容易、士宜加緊求學、農宜加緊生產、工宜增進技能、商宜提倡國貨、各從本位、努力做起、中國當然有無窮的希望、同時、我們更應該注意的、就是農工商之進步、均非由士之智識增進不為功、因為農村生產之增加、工業技能之進步、商人愛國心之發達、都是敎育上重要的目的、都是讀書運動最大的目標、</p>
<p>再舉一個最淺近的例證、大家都知道今後的戰爭是立體戰爭、空軍在今後的戰事上是估着决定勝負的地位的、因此年來舉國上下、都致力於航空救國、然而航空兩字的內容、是包括着多少的專門學識、以一架飛機之製造而言、就需要機械工程、電氣工程、礦冶工頭、化學工程、紡織工程等等、飛機場之建築及燈光設備而言、又非需要土木工程和理化專家的設計不可、航空救國、固然需要經濟、需要財力、然而更需要的是人力、是學力、難道祇向外國買了幾百架幾千架飛機、就能救得了國嗎、我們自己能製造飛機、駕駛飛機、方能談得到航空救國、我們希望能自己製造、便需要讀書、便需要研究科學、誰不知道中國農村的破產、誰不知道再不救濟農村、中國國亡無日、然而救濟農村也是空言所能了事的嗎、在在都需要眞實的舉問、所以我們在這千鈞一髮的時候、應該脚踏實地、切實做起、盡我們的天職、應國家民族的急需、</p>
<p>中國文化建設協會爲國防及生產之需要、主辦了讀書競進會、又舉行全國讀書運動大會、希望全國同志同胞、明暸這一個重要的意義、身體力行、要知道、充實自己的學力、即所以充實民族的力量、建設自身的智能、卽所以建設民族的文化、文化復興運動完成之時、也就是民族復興運動礎石奠定之日、完了、</p>

<h3 id="c169">張素民講　怎樣研究經濟學 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>昨為中國文化建說協會、主辦之全國讀書運動大會第十日、該會特請國立曁南大學銀行系主任張素民博士講演怎樣研究經濟學、茲錄演詞如下、</p>
<p>兄弟今天承中國文化建設協會、邀請講演「怎樣研究經濟學」一題、茲就管見所及、與諸君一談、</p>
<p>經濟學的重要　經濟生活佔人類生活的最大部份、所謂經濟生活、包括財富的生產分配交換和費等一切活動、農莊·工廠·商店·寫字間·運輸機關等、是生產和分配之所在、一切買賣是屬於交換、衣食住行等、是屬於消費、吾人鷄嗚而起、出外上工或辦公、即欲對生產服務、而分配一份、以便交換他物、滿足消費的慾望也、我雖不是一元的經濟史觀論者、然不能不承認經濟生活對於其他的生活的影響之大、儒家有先富後敎之說、管子有足衣食、實倉廩之論、可見吾國的先哲、巳早見及此、經濟學是研究經濟生活方面的科學、其重要可不言而喻、加以現代經濟情形日益複雜、欲明白瞭解之、更賴乎經濟學之研究、</p>
<p>經濟學的對象　從前學者以為經濟學只是研究人類取得財富與使用財富等活動的科學、認定經濟學的對象是財富等、現代學者以為經濟學是研究、由取得財富與使用財富等所發生之人的關係及如何可以增進人的幸福之科學、故認定經濟學的對象是幸福、例如吾人研究中國經濟、不僅注重發達生產事業與提高消費程度、而且應注重發達生產如何有益於平民及如何可以提高平民的消費程度及增進平民的幸福、</p>
<p>入門的方法　研究經濟學的入門方法可分兩種、一、為研究經濟學的基本原理、一、為研究實際經濟問題、欲研究基本原理、自應從敎科書入手、能讀西文的、可選一部「標準敎科書」、如伊利的「經濟學大綱」或拜雷蒙的「經濟學原理」、均無不可、如讀中文的、可選讀王建祖譯的「基特經濟學一、或陳家瓚譯的「津村秀松的、經濟學熱讀一部書、冉參看二三部書、對於基本原理、可知其大概、至於研究實際經濟問題、如關於世界的、可讀一部西文的一經濟問題」的書、此類書在西文頗多、可任選一部、如關於中國的此類書極少、據我所知、馬寅初先生的新著「中國經濟改造」、對於中國的各種重要經濟問題、皆有詳細的討論、可以稱為第一部「中國經濟問題」的書、中國銀行最近發刊的「二十三年營業報告」、對於去年經濟情形、言之頗明晰、此外吾人應留意中西報章雜誌所載關於經濟的新聞與論文、只要吾人留意、隨時隨地皆是研究少資料、</p>
<p>專門的研究　一部經濟學所包括的各項題目、皆可作為終身的專門研究、如貨幣·銀行·勞工·運輸·分配·消費·管理·及其他各項、皆可以畢生之力研究云、愛研究思想學說的、世界經濟思想史、亦是一個大題目、吾人可以本性之所好、擇定一題、作精深專門的研究、</p>
<p>學理的運用　吾人研究經濟學、不僅為「智力的運動」而巳、吾人應求解决問題、以前的學者分經臍學為「純正經濟學」與「應用經濟學」與「應用經濟學」以為前者是研究原理的、後者乃是解决問題的、實則此種分類、係募倣自然科學而來、就經濟學言、此種分類不甚妥當、經濟學的原理、即是討論問題的原理、原理不能解决問題、即失却原理的資格、吾人應於研究問題中、求發現新原理、所以吾人對於已有的一切原理、明白暸解之後、對於實際問題的解决、應斟酌環境、臨時擬出方案、所擬的方案的根據、或為舊有的原理、或為由舊有各原理融會貫通及依照問題的環境而定出的新原理、欲做到此層、非研究甚深、見解甚富不可云、</p>

<p>— （臥佛）</p>
<p>在社會上做人，的確是不容易的，不容易，當然是「難」了。分而別之，做人是有三種的難：一是「難做人」，一是「做難人」，一是「做人難。」</p>
<p>「難做人」，處在這樣生活程度日高的社會，特別是在不景氣下，旣挑了一副仰事俯蓄的重擔子，又要親戚朋友的酬酢。做這樣的人，試問難也不難？</p>
<p>「做難人」，你因為激於愛國的執沈，去做救國的運動，可是人家說你太激烈了，甚至說你反動；但你如把國家的興亡，置諸度外，沒有表示，人家又要說你沒有國家觀念。其他類此的正多着。做這樣的人，又試問難也不難？</p>
<p>「做人難」，做了人，該對社會趕些有益的事，該對國家有所貢獻。但這旣要學識，又要時機，沒有這種學識與時機，你這個人，就虛生一世，負了國家，負了社會，還負了自己。做這樣的人，又試問難也不難？</p>
<p>但是，拿破耑字典中沒有「難」字，我們也要打陂這個「難」字呀！</p>

<p>天氣這樣悶人幾幾乎要呌個個人睡覺，雖然春天是到來了，好似大家都到春野去活躍着，然而仔細一想，也不過只是睡覺運動放大一些而已。</p>
<p>「春眠不覺曉，處處聞啼鳥」，在大都市裏，是沒有像詩境那麼幽雅的睡眠，究竟每天侵晨，總是那麼鬧嚷嚷的，並且還要呌每個人到街上去嘗到糞的臭味，馬桶蕭蕭聲，也就像作着臭的歌曲的前奏。</p>
<p>更有那馬路上的塵灰，老是跟着電車，汽車打滾，滾到每個人的身上，滾到每個人的嘴裏，滾到每個人的眼睛裏，……中委褚民誼先生說過，在上海馬路上行走，千萬要記着把嘴巴鎖牢，開着便要吃灰，也許因此吃着各種傳染的病。</p>
<p>外表上都是好看，骨子裏是一團糟，看着許多人是在為着大衆謀福利，其實用顯微鏡去照一下，他們的出發點，都是在打算着多撈幾個錢。</p>
<p>一切專家都出風頭，他們的生意在此百般不景氣中，是特別來得興旺，胡鬧來這一套，胡鬧來那一套，把一些愚笨人弄得像熱鍋上的隻隻螞蟻，上了當也心願的。</p>

<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省　火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>年紀輕的人，總是喜歡年紀輕的人的。自從那次和北海相遇，月英就存一種感想，覺得這人不錯。今天赤身睡在人家被籠裏，偏偏是他到了，可說是巧極。立刻身上一陣熱氣由脚頂心直透到臉上來。王北海走進屋來，見帳子是放下來的。而房門又朝外虛搭着，似乎程先生不睡在床上，若睡在床上，豈有門在外面扣着之理。再看看床底下，也並沒有鞋子，這更可以明白，床上是空的。他一點也不猶豫，直向床邊走來，正待伸着手去掀帳子，月英在裏面是看得很淸楚，情不自禁的哇的一聲呌了出來。王北海猛可的一驚，嚇得將身子倒退了兩步。先怔了一怔，然後又退了兩步，心裏可就想着這分明是個女人的聲音。程先生那樣循規蹈矩的人，他的床上，會躺着女人，這可是奇事。他旣然不在屋子裏，我在這裏也不方便，還是出去，依然把門扣搭了，只當沒有進來，不要點破了這事，程先生怪難爲情的。他如此的想着，人向外走，剛出房門，就碰到了一個茶房，於是低聲笑道　程先坐屋子裏，怎麼有個女人睡在床上。那茶房恰是個多事的人，就把月英摔在泥水裏，暫時在這裏躱避，等候換衣服的經過，說了一遍。（一八六）</p>

<p>這些製鞋的藝工的生活，說來也是極單調的；伊們的內心上，似乎是永遠不會受到什麼刺激，連輕微的震動也很少。一年到頭，伊們只是專心致志的從事着做鳳鞋的工作：早上起身，白天工作，吃飯，晚來上床安息，每天做着這樣刻板的文章：我自己可說是萬萬受不住的，所以我想伊們旣然能終年的樂此不疲，必然也自有一種局外人所體味不出來的興趣在着。記得我曾經向那兩個處於領袖地位上的老處女問起過，伊們都表示很快活，唯一的原因乃是伊們對於這種繡作生活，天性特別的愛好：而這製鞋的一業，不但可以充分的發揮伊們的刺繡的才技，他如打鞋樣，配鞋底等等，也無不含有一種美的意味，足以鼓動一般愛好美術者的興趣。伊們的快樂，大槪就從這中間得來的。這倒是很合理的說法。因為我們無論敎那一個人做一件工作，工作本身的輕重，猶可不加計較，最要緊的是必須這件工作恰合這個人的性之所好；大凡性之所好的工作，　做起來必定起勁，一起勁便可做來特別的圓滿，而且還會久而不倦。現在這兩位老處女，便是這樣。至於伊們手下那八位年輕的姑娘呢？我雖未曾請敎過，但料想起來，情形也約略相同；因為凡有做不慣這項工作的，早就稱病告退了，所剩下的自然都是對此確具興趣的人了！（二九六）</p>

<p>「世上三行苦，撑船打鐵磨豆腐」。這是誰都知道的，但是在這三行之外，我却又發現一樣苦的工作，其苦的程度，並不下於以上三行。</p>
<p>我們每一次走入浴堂，總要看見幾個被水浸得白茫茫的擦背者，皮層連一點血色都沒有，他們每天皆是從上午十時起，到第二天上午二時止，這中間十六小時，他們總是被浸在水獄裏，一天兩天，一年二年，都是這樣生活著，卽或有一點變動，也不過是由這一處水獄，轉移到另一處水獄罷了，他們終年因為受水的浸潤，熱氣的蒸淘，皮膚便轉變成紙樣的白，全身的血液，也就被水與熱氣融成稀薄了，這還不算，他們除了受水與氣的浸蝕以外，還要做工作，每一個浴客，自頂至踵，總要從他們手中經過，擦背呀，去垢呀，替每一個人洗浴之後，他們便要出一身汗，汗本來是人人應當出的，但是他們的汗出得太多了，以致形成一個白茫茫的人，這樣的生活着，無論是怎樣一個强健的人，也要一天一天的衰弱下去，他們自己也知道，這種工作，是對於身體的戕賊，但是已經做了這種職業，為生活驅使着，明知是入地獄，然已無可挽救了。</p>
<p>撐船，打鐵，磨豆腐，固然是苦，我看浴堂裏的擦背者，的確是比他們更苦，我們每次沐浴，有時因為時間較久，還要頭暈，擦背者每天繼續要在浴堂中工作十六小時之久，這是多麼苦痛的一伴事啊！</p>

<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>青島本來是個荒野的半島，自從遜淸時租借給德國之後，德人漸漸的經營，造起了砲台和船塢，便成了我國良好的軍港，和避暑的勝境了。在一九一四年，歐洲大戰，日本乘着德國無暇東顧之時，把靑島爭奪到手，便視作自已的殖民地，努力經營，逐漸把靑島的風物同化，雖是經了華盛頓和會的交涉，收歸了主權的大半，只是島上巳滿佈着日本的色彩，尤其是到了春天，櫻花盛開的時節，充份地現出三島的風光，彷彿成了日本的半殖民地，就是日本政府，也何曾有一天忘掉靑島是自己的勢力可以達到的所在地。</p>
<p>一到了春季，靑島各地的櫻花，爛縵地開放，到處可以看見。櫻花是日本的國花，盛開的時候，日本舉國若狂，靑島在這時候，也有櫻花會的舉行，全島人民，終朝的遊玩，尤其是日本僑民，異常的快樂，在第一公園，神社，等櫻花遍植的所在，處處可以見到和聽到日本的情調。</p>
<p>靑島的神社，供奉着日本的神道，常見着許多日本人在那裏祝拜，我國千百年來相傳的釋道兩敎的寺院，却從沒有瞧見一次。</p>
<p>忠魂碑下葬的便是日本人的忠魂，奪靑島時戰死的日本軍士，建造的式樣，沒一處不是日本的建築和式樣，在日本國內，可以瞧到同樣的忠魂碑，尤其是日本軍士在碑下致敬的時候，使人有靑島是否是日本殖民地的感想。</p>
<p>島上各處的建築，除了高大洋房之外，大半是日本式的房屋，聊城路附近一帶，竟找不到一幢不是日本式的房屋。所住的僑民，又都是和服的日本人，開的商店，沒一家不是出售日本的貨品，就是最繁華的中山路，日本的商店，怕得佔有三份之二吧！小菜塲的菜肴，最多的便是日本的　魚和萊藤。</p>
<p>島上有日本的咖啡館，館內排列着日本的下女。有日本的劇塲，開演的是日本情調的歌舞劇。有日本的待合處和妓院，充滿着日本的賣淫婦。有日本的押所，有日本的料理館，和其餘種種日本人經營的商店，凡是日本國內所有的東西，在靑島沒一件缺乏，無怪日本人到了靑島，便可以視為自己的境地，因為靑島全區，完全是日本色彩了。</p>

<p>金市昨以銀價續跌、滙市趨緊、上塲頗能很作而漲、但因賣方趁高活動、不久復告下游、後市交易淸淡、缺乏維持、結果反跌、晨初以海外銀市一致下跌、大條脚地、又謂收市後在掛牌價〇六二五至一二五之下有成交、蒙得里遠期銀市升降不一、匯兌則縮、倫敦生金未更、塲外預備交易開出、升至二十元外、但人心未甚堅俏、開後因中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱縮、海關金單位漲一分一厘、標金標準價升爲八六六元七角、即告上升、雖有回挫、無奈銀行努力扒結、美滙內盤步緊、為狀殊形堅昂、銀行趁貴塞出先令、大戶紛紛售條而跌、此時因滙豐銀行掛脾揭曉、英縮一二五、美縮三一二五、匯市尙緊而多盤、白銀平衡稅揭曉勿動、亦無影響、入後廣帮有所塞出、內盤稍鬆、賣戶趨殷、而破二十元大關、逐步下游、惟大戶趁低奮進、銀行買胃尙健、以致沙避雖塞、低後尙易拉上、午刻呈盤旋狀態、後市上塲平穩、滙市頗形緊翁、其奈金市缺乏成交、離趨上游、雖有一度微漲、無如買氣至暫、晚手者極形殷勤、終於平定、印銀兩次均告微跌、此時尙有維持、大勢遂更無聊、迨後買方陡告旁觀、浮多紛紛了結、謠傳略起、激動賣風、假期關係、塲內更乏對手、以致供過於求、突告下跌、全日市况、因春假關係倍極淸平、今將一天市况誌後、</p>

<p>後市開盤八一七元九角、旋退為七元半、大通售予中國四月份美金已三七五、福興永恒餘進至八元九角、元昌永嘉潤惠祥脫手、退為七元六角、印銀初次下降一·二·一安那、餘慶永納條、升為八元八角、入後成交更稀、印銀二次雖小一·一·一安那、無甚影響、徘徊於八元光景者殊久、入後散多脫手、而漸不支、恒餘嘉潤福餘乾昌祥義豐永大德成大昌祥以及散戶紛紛脫售、塲內略有畢德門主張提高銀價之謠、逐漸跌至一元七角、大德成益成趁低維持、收盤為八一三元、收市後益成雖進、元茂永同泰昌順利大昌祥等紛粉售條而略挫、查一天間最高價八二五元、最低價八一一元七角、計有十三元三角起仆、結果蛟前收下跌六元、</p>

<h3 id="c217">雜論幽默 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>「幽默運動」之盛，在中國的文化運動上，也可以說「罕有其匹」吧。然而如果我們把紙老虎一戮穿，里面就是空無一物了。有的假幽默以自嗚淸高，賣弄一點不關痛癢的小諷刺，博得大家拍掌；有的以幽默來遺興寄懷，正如「寓沉痛於苦茶」一樣，坐在沙發裏，抽着吉士，啜香茗，唼唼嘴，嘆了一聲，「閒適」的氣，然後翻開二十世紀笑林廣記，講了幾句「發鬆的」半俏皮半正經的話。惹得大家作「會心的微笑」。於是乎「幽默」「幽默」，最後竟連戲台上的小丑底打餫也搬上來凑貨色了。</p>
<p>然而如果因此便說幽默運動只是一些野心家的登龍術，「無關天下與亡」的，那却是一個大大的不對。幽默運動之所以盛極一時，决不只是由於提倡者一手所造成，而是有其客觀的社會的根據的。許多人不滿於現實，於是以「謔而不虐」、的辭句，去諷刺他們所憎惡的對象，便成為他們底憤懣的惟一的發洩的方法了。由此我們可以說，幽默運動底產生，並不是偶然的，而是具有其合理的存在的理由的。澈底的猛烈的哄笑是必要的，一種柔和的，不諷刺的冷笑也是需要的。「幽默是刮刮叫的矯正者。故而幽默的喜劇是指摘出缺點且敎之以如何地除去這些缺點的柔和的諷刺的喜劇—牠是置於人們之前的鏡子，並不是一看見牠就驚慌到想找繩子或釘子的鏡子，而是一看了牠就感覺到有洗洗險刮刮鬍子的必要的鏡子」。</p>
<p>幽默底作用和力量，於此足見一斑。幽默雖然一不够盡情地暴露現實一，這是對的。然而說「牠往往可以將大衆奮鬥的决心熱情化作一陣輕烟，」「將屠戶的兇殘，化為輕烟似的一笑」，那倒未必。假如眞的這麼着，那是「幽默」的錯，而不是幽默底錯。問題在如何地從幽默中淸除去那些油腔滑調挿科打諢，「會心的微笑」，「預期的逆應」等等撈什子，而把牠轉化為敎育一般人，使一般人感覺到現實底醜相，而使他們自己感覺到有呌牠（現實）洗洗臉刮鬍子的必要的工具之一。幽默雖然「不够盡情地暴露現實」，然而牠却仍可以暴露現實（雖然不能「盡情地」）。針對現實底黑暗面底某些面相而與以諷刺的暴露，雖然不能「全面地」暴露而給我一條出路，然而在帮助一般人認識現實底面相而使他們感覺到有改革牠的必要這一點上，牠已經盡了牠底任務作用。</p>
<h3 id="c218">接受批評與駡 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 胡依凡</p>
<p>前幾時的「自由談」上，發表了唐弢先生一篇「接受批評」的文章，在那裏，談到了接受批評與駡的問題，我覺得這倒是値得注意一下的，</p>
<p>唐弢先生涉及這問題的那一叚上，他這樣說：</p>
<p>「但現在據說又是連眞理也在疼哭了，這是因為批評家駡倒了一切。</p>
<p>「事實上，駡也還有分別的。開口就是「媽的」的漫駡固然要不得；可是能够捉住破綻而細數之的疼駡，却仍舊可以接受。」</p>
<p>我不知道這裏所指出的「現在據說又是連眞理也在疼哭了」，是不是眞的是「這是因為批評家駡倒了一切」，我不想去深論它，是因為唐　先生的文章巳經答復了。而唐弢先生提出的意見，是相反的。所以他談到了駡，就讓步而又讓步地說：「事實上，駡也還有分別的」。於是他纔指出了批評上有：「要不得」的「漫駡」，和「却仍舊可以接受」的「能够捉住破綻而細數之的疼駡」。</p>
<p>他覺得據說的眞理也在疼哭，這是實在不能一筆抹殺了批評家的，就因為他相信批評家「也是人」，「他是懂得別人的作品的」。</p>
<p>我是贊同唐弢先生的說法的，但是我却還要補充點意見。</p>
<p>其實，要談到接受批評的問題，這是眞理的爭持的問題。批評家的態度是需要嚴肅，客觀，不能一味流於漫駡或武斷，以惹起被批評者——作家的反感，或甚至「置之不理」，這似乎是用不着第二句話了，誰都明白。但縱使你這樣做了，果如唐弢先生說的，「能够捉住破綻而細數之的疼駡，就眞的「却仍舊可以」呌人—那些被批評者的作家虛衷「接受」嗎？</p>
<p>沒有再明白如唐弢先生自己說的！因爲那些作家們早在「一齊置之不理了，而且，『却照例終有幾句話說。或者說：「這是台灣人呀！」或者說：「這是某系某派呀！」而比較澈底的，則是：「喂！你指着你自己的鼻子了！」在「非難批評」，「抵制批評」了！」</p>
<p>你就是再善意的，客觀的批評家，你又能盒這些人怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>這裏，就要使我們接觸到了作家主觀上的認識問題，和作家本身的藝術上的修養問題，加果當眞要談到批評和接受批評評</p>
<p>對於一個早已使人絕望了的作家，或者說，認識已完全走到向後轉的人，批評家之於他，雖有「却仍舊可以接受」的批評擺着——「能够捉住破綻而細數之的疼駡」，也是全然不濟的；因為他早已向着你說了：「喂！你是台灣人呀！你是某派某系呀！你指着你自已的鼻子了。」還能同他談到接受批評嗎？你的駡再有分別，你的斯文的疼駡還沒開口，他就早已一味「置之不理」，甚至老羞成怒，「含血噴人」了，這倒成了他一貫的態度。這時候，你除了無情地在露天之下剝出他的原形以外，能有更好的方法以優容他嗎，使他再來虛衷地接受批評？</p>
<p>有理論根據的善意的批評，能對於一個被批評者——作家發生批評上的作用的，是祗有認識糢糊，或世界觀確定而藝術上的修養不够的人。這種人是能够期望他虛衷地接受批評的。如果一個批評家能抓得住他們的弱點，你這時候，你就不客氣對他說：「你不能這樣偷懶取巧呀！」，或者說：「你這不是路呀，你鑽進了牛角尖！」或甚至說：「你這樣是倒做了敵人的夥伴了！」由你怎樣去細數去疼駡，他是不至於拒絕你的，祗要批評家自己的態度是眞摯而嚴肅。而且這疼駡已不復是駡，倒成了扶導，糾正和獎掖了。有自己的正確世界觀的，或願意向上的作家，對這樣的疼駡的批評，不祗是「却仍舊可以接受」，且一定是要由衷地樂意接受了。</p>
<p>但這樣，同時不要忘記了批評家自己：武者小路實篤的話：批評人「也是人」，這話是不錯的：說他們「不會根本地懂得別人的作品的」，這談却是大錯。但說相信個個批評家都能够「懂得別人的作品的」，就不見得。為什麼？因為批評家中，有祗會漫駡的批評家存在，也更有滿肚皮毒瘡的批評家的產生。對於這樣的批評家的任意的亂駡咬人，和胡說八道，你能理采他嗎？在這塲合，開明的作家對這種「絕對荒謬的批評家」的答復，就不復是「接受批評」，而必然是迎（！）頭疼擊。因之，就需要有一個固執的爭求眞理的健全的「批評家」的批評家出現了。</p>
<p>所以，我的意見是：講到批評與「接受批評」，事實上，也還有分別的駡，漫駡固然要不得；可是有「能够捉住破綻而細數之的疼駡」，理論上，也許「却仍舊可以接受」，事實上，却仍舊要看是）個怎樣的批評家，和怎樣的）個被批評者——作家。</p>
<h3 id="c219">黃毛尖 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 周啓</p>
<p>山頭兒的名字就呌「黃毛尖。」</p>
<p>黃毛尖拔陸幾多尺？還沒有測量隊到過，不大淸楚。不過照翻印日本人的。軍用地圖上看來，却是用密密的黑綫圈兒一套一套的畫成。我們上這黃毛尖，足足仰頭爬三天。</p>
<p>第三天爬到黃毛尖的頂，眼看遠近的羣山都低了頭，比這山頂兒更高的，祇有我們的「老天」。不過有時老天也低下頭來，撒下雲霧，和山尖兒親吻，或是說跟山尖兒戴一頂帽子。</p>
<p>我們到了黃毛尖，趕快搭起蓬帳兒，預備好生住三天。要是三天以內通不見匪踪兒，那麼就算摸得不准，接着到旁的山上去。反正一句話，在這半個月當中，怎麼也得在山裏穿，因為命令上是指定這夥見人在山裏搜索的。</p>
<p>正是春天了，山尖兒上長起了靑草，太陽很和暖，晒得那些穿着棉軍服的弟兄儘出汗，出汗總不暢，於是有些就把軍服裏的棉絮拖出來拉矢用，棉的權當夾的用。伕子們，眼看一連有幾天不挑担，望着天空見，有着閒空想起家兒來。無綫電的冲電機，在山坡兒上「拍拍」地呌。天空裏，多的是電波，那耳上夾着聽筒的人在電波裏找自己的信號。有時，他們還聽一曲從上海或是小呂宋播來的歌調…日子是平和地過去兩天了。</p>
<p>可是一件意外的事情竟在第二天的晚上發生了。因為大家已經睡在蓬帳裏，最初祇有各處的哨兵知道。</p>
<p>是掛着大月亮的天空，三更過後却佈起了雲陣，雲陣愈佈愈密，愈厚，終於把月亮掩遮得看不見了。從天角，括來了一陣風暴，不上幾分鐘，這風暴便狂天狂地的大作起來，終於把雲裏的雨點吹了下來，起先還小，可是愈吹愈大了，這時，山裏就起了一陣狂嘯。「嘩—嘩—，」像無數人在衝錄，在呌號。「拍」的無綫電的架綫竿折了，「嘩啦」，蓬帳給吹飛了，接着是一羣淋着驟雨人的慘號。伕子，那蓋着幾根禾草的伕子，急得在黑暗的山上亂跑。帶兵官，慌忙得起來查哨。風，愈括愈大了。雨，愈下愈暴了。氣候，急劇地變成寒冬。雨點立刻變成氷點。不多一會兒，哨兵跌倒了，伕子跌倒了，騾馬跌倒了，衣被箱籠被山洪冲下山去了：………風雨愈益大了，黃毛尖，這時的黃毛尖是一片擾騷，一片慘號。</p>
<p>第二天清早，忽然的，風雨都停了，地上不知被那個聰敏的匠人，儘半夜工夫，統統舖上厚玻璃了。樹枝上，靑草上，伕子的面上，槍桿上，全鑲上玻璃了。鬍子上，長髮上，騾馬的尾巴上，槍尾盤着的蘇頭上，全掛上玻璃的風鈴了。沒有吹去的蓬帳給冰固封了，活着的人的眉毛頭髮統變白了。號兵吹集合號，不能不集合下山了，可是號兵吹不響軍號了。軍號裏全塞着氷了。……山頂上依然是一片擾騷，一片慘號。</p>
<p>「下山，下山，不下山沒有命了。　」</p>
<p>大夥再也不能和寒冷抵抗，被自然的威力脅迫着，祗能下山了。可是所有的東西，全給氷封凍着，再也帶不走。有的人在坡上一滑交，粉身在陡壁下了。</p>
<p>下山的時候，依然是一片擾騷，一片慘號。</p>
<p>待走下坡去十幾里，好像變着戲法一樣，紅炎的太陽又復照着我們濕透的衣服，天空是一片晴朗了。我們知道這是老天跟我們開玩笑。不過回頭再看山尖見，山尖兒當在雲霧中，我們眞莫不清這時在清醒還是在夢中。</p>
<p>可是給遺留在山頂兒上的人呢，他們在沒有遇着敵人的時候便犧性了。</p>
<h3 id="c220">中國藝術國際展覽會出品過目記（三） <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>第四室第五室陳列宋明以來的瓷器，凡三百十四件。在這中國磁器沒落的時代，看看北宋定窰·鈞窰·汝窰·官窰·龍泉窰·哥窰·建陽窰·諸窰出品的精美，再看看南宋，吉州窰。明永樂窰，宣德窰，色彩體式的進步，不能不嘆息民族衰老，卽從這些日用品的制作已經顯示出來。景德鎭窰，自來以來，兼取諸窰的優點，所製器皿無所不備，現在也什麼都不如從前，也許中國磁器的光榮　將與景德鈸一同完結呢！塲中有許多、看了淸初康熙·雍正·乾隆三朝的　　，不獨鮮紅的動人心目，那些天靑的　黃的吹紫的更是鮮艷，相與嘖嘖稱美。但是他們的家常日用飲食器具，不是日本貨，便是西洋貨，幾乎忘記景德鎭的出品了呢！</p>
<p>第六室陳列古書·玉器·景泰藍·剔紅以及考古物品選例等等，古書部份還沒有到齊。刻本有南宋，金·元·淸各朝刻本，以刻本為主，我上文巳贊美編排人的卓識。洪武官刻本的華夷譯語，刻得極精。刻本外，有拜月亭傳奇·靈寳刀傳奇兩種鈔本，那眞工緻可愛極了。我們處在這粗製濫造的海派工藝圈子，看見了這手工業時代的精品，不禁有古今人不相及之嘆。我對於玉器，素來沒有什麼好感，除了器物本身的價値，在文化史上也沒有什麼了不得的意義。有許多太太們倒大為起勁，恨不得打碎玻璃把櫃中玉器來比比她臂上的玉鐲。乾隆年問的玉器，有幾伴雕刻得極精，更引動太太們的愛好。考古物品組，如石斧·石刀·骨簇·骨笄，銅戈·銅矛，等等，很多已在安陽發掘報告，東方文化之黎明那些書上看見過，看了實物，自然更感到興味。據我所知，中央研究院在河南　掘的成績，他們研究的範圍，比這樣廣大得多。我們希望將來河南會變成東方的彭皮。</p>
<p>當然，我應該告白我自己的立塲，我是以研究中國古代文化的意義去看那個展覽會的，也許有許多話觸犯了藝術家古董收藏家的尊嚴，罪過！罪過！（完）</p>

<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>接着試題提出來了，巨卿先生要請敎校長先生的就是「頭腦冬烘」這四個字。</p>
<p>校長先生並沒有回答這試題，臉上一陣陣變着顏色，每一根靑筋都在太陽穴上綻出來，拍着桌，大聲地駡罵着，終於和巨卿先生扭扭結結地攪在一起，巨卿先生被他們　推　擁地扭到街上，又扭向公安局去了。</p>
<p>靜靜的小街起了波瀾，看熱鬧的人像看賽會一樣多。</p>
<p>章校長和巨卿先生扭着在頭裏，左右簇擁着瘦長子和挂　毛的敎員；巨郷先生的十幾個學生跟在後面，還有許多男男女女看新聞的閑人，春水池塘的蝌蚪羣一樣地，挨挨擠擠在街上</p>
<p>「你們看啊，校長先生寫別字！」</p>
<p>一路走，石卿先生一路沙着喉嚨高聲喊：</p>
<p>「校長先生寫別字，多體面啊！」</p>
<p>可是到了公安局以後，巨卿先生卻連分說幾句的機會也沒有。他們連問一問誰是誰非也不需要，祇讓章校長慷慨激昂地向巡長陳說了一通，巨卿先生就被押起來了。</p>
<p>巨卿師母發了瘋樣的，哭哭啼啼滿街跑，鎭上幾位紳士先生的家裏，差不多跑遍了。</p>
<p>見着人就是叩頭，一把眼淚，一把鼻涕，懇求對方營救她的丈夫，她一生經歷過多少慘痛的際遇，却不曾闖過這樣的禍；恐怖和焦急支配着她的神經中樞，她變成倘完全失去了知覺的人。</p>
<p>一直跑到黃昏後，才拿到一張商會會長褚潤夫的名片；巨卿先生從公安局拘留所出來的時候，已經是晚上十一點，鎭上人全都睡盡了。</p>
<p>回到了家裏，巨卿先生始終不說一句話。雙眼更深深地陷進去，發着閃閃的光；面孔跟鐵鑄成一樣的無表情。問要喝茶不要，不出聲；說休息一下吧，不出聲。一個個不出聲。</p>
<p>萬靜中忽然猛的吼起來，聲音凄厲而高昂：</p>
<p>「我犯了什麼王法，坐拘留！」</p>
<p>一拳打在桌上，美孚油燈突的跳起來，隨着光綫暗得搖搖欲減。巨卿師母和她的媳婦，在旁邊駭得一陣陣的打哆嗦。</p>
<p>「我這條老命不要了，我跟你們拚命！」</p>
<p>朋！又是一拳，站起身來要闖出去，被婆媳倆拉住了，把他按倒在椅子上。</p>
<p>頹然無力地坐着，全身感得刻骨的疲倦。</p>
<p>以後怎麼樣呢？這書房，這孤　寡　的灰色的家？這掃盡斯文的侮辱？……</p>
<p>昏昏沉沉地，他看見幾百變勢利的眼睛亂箭般向他投射，幾百張冷嘲熱諷的面孔向他示威，他的眼前胡亂地舞動着幾千幾百顆的金星，他的腦門上有一塊天大的烏雲迅速地壓下來。</p>
<p>他的身體猛然從椅子上倒下地去，什麼也不知道了。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c222">學生服用國貨宣讀願詞禮 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 峰</p>
<p>今年是學生國貨年，昨天是學生服用國貸宣讀願詞日，此後學生便負起自，己服用國貨，和勸導親戚朋友服用國貨的兩大使命，此種責任，原是責無傍貸，義不容辭的。</p>
<p>但是要勸導人家服用國貨，第一自己先要服用國貨，比無待論，否則更無口可開，學生的國貨年，不是學生應該用國貨而非學生卽不必定用國貨，更不是學生應用國貨，而一出校門便不該用國貨，此意應該大家明白的，余意學生之中，尤其是大學生更宜服用國貨，因為大學生的通病，一做大學生，便趾高氣揚，開口外國，閉口外國，——出洋過的更不必說，——視國貨如草芥，一錢不値，不是西裝革履，便似失去大學生的體面人格，一種鄙夷國貨的觀念，滋然深種於心田，於是中學生羨慕大學生的神氣，亦往往西裝革履，而一切服用，亦惟舶來品是尙，此種心理的造成，若根本上的說，實足亡國滅種而有餘、。</p>
<p>因為大學生是中學生的模範，中學生是小學生的模範，若大學生能養成愛用國貨的習慣，則中小學生的習慣，亦自易養成，至於服用國貨，原是國民的天職，無論現在我國國家社會的經濟，已到了山窮水盡的絕境，更不該不用國貨，就是國家社會經濟比較充裕，也應該服用國貨，因為棄國用外，則結果必有山窮水盡的一日。</p>
<p>今天趁此要說的不但學生，我更勸有錢的人服用國貨，和比較無錢的人，更為要緊，因為富厚之家，汽車一輛，動輒幾千兩，沙發一只，動輒數十元，而貧乏之家，雖欲不用國貨，而亦無此購買能力，則有錢的人能用國貨，比較貧乏者關係更鉅，我更勸商人服用國貨，和非商人的服用國貨尤應注意，因為普通人家，對於國貨和非國貨的鑑別能力，異常薄弱，而有一般奸商，惟利是圖，往往以非國貨而冒充國貨，魚目混珠，所在皆是，此種商人，亦宜及早覺悟，痛自改革。非特免受傍人的警告，卽在自己天良所責備，亦恐沒世而不能忘。</p>
<h3 id="c223">通惠綢莊 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>第一祖魚販子挑過中市的時候，通惠綢莊門前有四五個工匠爬在高高的梯子上用五色的綠布紮着大减價的牌樓，經理周先生像一個猴子似的，從店堂跳到街心，街心跳回店堂，帮同整理布匹，額角上滲着細小的汗珠，那張皺縮的黃臉彷彿新塑的佛像一像地金光彩爛，每個細胞都蘊孕着希望的光彩，這是魚</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>販子二哥開春以來第一次瞧見周先生的一奮興底臉。</p>
<p>通惠綢莊是全縣最老的牌子店，牠們前兩幅抱對樣的金字招牌是全縣人所記得淸淸楚楚的，本店始創於光緒十二年，專門採辦各省綾羅綢緞。可是現在泥金斑剝，內層的草泥都暴露在木板上了；然而經理周先生正以此為榮，牌子店應該有這樣兩幅古老的金字招牌的！</p>
<p>周先生是當學徒出身的，在頭次革命以後纔爬上了經理的地位。他看得多，見得多，做生意要和氣生財是他第一信條，做學徒的不得越規矩一步，他自己就是這樣店東器重而升到現在經理的地位。每當一天歇業後，在晚餐的時候，他喝着酒，對學徒們講述他到這店要來十幾年的歷史。他每一件事都能够記得詳細年月，他某年進店，某年正式升店員，某年某學徒因慢客被歇，這樣的故事他每天鄭重其事要細述一遍，而且决不前後倒亂，或者偶然遺漏一件所以他接手以來，全縣大戶人家的生意都被他包辦了，他像極重要的人物似的，時常在那些鄉董晉紳之家出出進進。某府娶媳婦，嫁女見，他早已揀了最新式的貨樣送上門去，聽憑選擇，價錢又是比同業公道。通惠綢莊的名兒就一年響一年起來，而兩幅牌子店的招牌上的字跡是幾乎使人無從辨認了。</p>
<p>東市西市的綢緞莊同樣開設了好多家，沒有做得過通惠糊莊的，就是說在貨色，招待，價錢，都及不來周先生會做生意。全縣不提起綢緞業便罷，否則祇有我們周先生的通惠綢莊。</p>
<p>周先生現在已是五十開外的年紀了，他的一生可以說是為了通惠綢莊而做人的，他早起，遲眠像做學徒時一般模樣，除了晚膳他喝幾杯例外的老酒。但是……</p>
<p>鬼見怪的縣城站忽然通起長途汽車來，這徵募了各商店的經費來開闢的馬路，却帶來了不可挽救的致命傷。全鈸的風尙突變，就是個怪現像。通惠綢莊門前時常有洋鬼子的服飾閃進周先生的眼簾，女人家的衣服更是彷彿花蝴蝶似的打眼，以牌子店自豪的通惠綢莊，那些最新花色的綢緞一時間黯然無光起來；每天做不到幾種生意，然而開銷却相反的增加，這一條長途汽車路上就是什麼捐什麼捐地一連串呌不順口的名自，周先生眼見着這種不祥的現像發生，向店主辭職幾乎是每天一次的公事了。</p>
<p>東西市的寳康，祥泰相繼歇業了。幾家掙扎着最後一口氣的綢緞業，不得不學着這長途汽車另一終點的洋塲來，紮綵牌樓，舉行大减價，洋鼓的聲響終日搥着擂着。周先生知悉了這情形，更是搖頭嘆息，沒有生意上門，再加添出這許多糜費的開消來，「眞是自作孽！」當學徒們告訴他某號舉行大减價的時候，他破口大駡了。但是第二個消息傳來，盛福莊，乾大號都是人山人海，每天可以做上半千生意。周先生驚奇着矛盾的現狀，同時洞悉了將價碼抬高的辦法，「不規矩」他被這三個字痛苦着，於是每天晚餐時不見他喝酒了，他很快吃了飯到店東府上商量這辦法可否實行。</p>
<p>終於在這天早上通惠綢莊門口紮起綵牌樓來了，這是周先生最後的决心，「要是生意再沒有起色，」他說：「我不幹了，幾十年來我沒有見過這種市面！」</p>
<h3 id="c224">雨的憶懷 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>淸早起來，推開朝南的玻璃窗，心里就有點不大高興，黃梅雨還是浙淅瀝瀝地下着，絲絲的，長綫條似的，織成一幅水晶似的窗簾，老是掛在窗前。</p>
<p>天空里堆砌着灰色的雲塊，一層層的，密密地凝凍着，把天空堆得陰沉沉的低得像塌在人們的頭頂上。遠遠的一片新著上嫩綠的衣裳的叢林，給迷濛的雨遮蓋着，像披上一層薄薄的輕紗。村口往鈸上去的那條田塍曲折的小徑，已是泥濘不堪了，幾個村人默默地撑着雨具跟踉蹌蹌很吃力地走着。小窪里的汚水和豆漿似的十泥，把他們的衣袴都濺濕了。</p>
<p>「討厭的梅雨天，眞是悶死人啊！」嘆了一口長氣，心底里暗暗地響着。</p>
<p>雨，本來和我是極有綠分的。但我却喜歡那澎湃奔騰的驟雨，和潺潺滂沱的淫雨，而不歡喜這淅零零的，絲絲的，毛也似的江南的黃梅雨。然而，這萬馬奔騰的驟雨，在江南每年是很少次數可以讓我怡然的欣賞的。當每年的一度下着黃梅雨的時候，總把我困在窄狹得轉不過屁股來的斗室里，默默地發愁，對着窗外病態的雨絲，而懷念着南國—暹羅—豪放澎湃的驟雨來了。</p>
<p>那時我正逗留南國，就在那個時侯，我才深深地領略了雨的雅緻的滋味和雨種下了極愛好的緣分。</p>
<p>熱帶下酷熱的南國，每年也有一個下雨的季節，一直下了一兩個月的悠長的時間，宛如江南的黃梅雨天。可是牠並不像江南的梅雨，整天的絲絲地飄拂着，使人的情緒過分地感到悲傷和惆悵！當雨還沒有下降的時候，天空像的碧海般的蔚藍，太陽兇狠地放出熱力，灼辣辣地儘在人們的頭頂上背脊上死勁地晒着。這美麗睛明的天空，誰也不相信過了兩三刻鐘之後會降下着滂沱奔騰的驟雨來哩！然而，正在這一剎那的時間，這睛明美麗的藍天，却變了顏色了。黑雲一朵朵地從天邊的角落里伸張起來　迅速地瀰漫了整個的天空，太陽也收歛了牠的熱力，逃進雲縫里去了；風顚狂地刮着，越刮越有勁兒，把四野的靑葱葱的樹木，搖撼得像虎嘯般的呼呼的饗着，大有「山雨欲來」的氣槪，接　便是那傾盆似的滂沱大雨，瀟瀟的敲着亞答屋的屋頂，這聲音是多麼淸脆可愛，有詩意的呵！此時，倘使你在午睡初醒的時候，聽屋頂那淸脆的聲音，那你就會聯想到消夜在荷塘池畔靜聆那「雨聲滴碎荷聲」的詩景中去了。</p>
<p>過了一兩個鐘頭之後，風雨完全地停北了，雲開天朗，太陽依然嵌在碧玉似的藍天里霧出嬌媚的笑臉來窺人，這時候，大地上的一切更顯得格外的淸新平靜的。於是，你拖着木展，獨個兒踽踽地走向郊外去，到河溝邊去靜聆那淙淙的流水，和欣賞那靑葱葱的樹葉上的晶瑩的水珠，在日光底下閃着金光。這時，你忘掉了南國的天氣的酷熱，你的胸懷自然而然地會覺得無限的愉適怡快的呵！</p>
<p>當我每次瞧着窗外的討厭的梅雨，總使我依依地懷念起南國的偷快的雨的季節來，可是，在幾重壓迫底下的華僑，已失掉了他們昔時的光榮，世界已不是他們的了！</p>
<p>這南國的奔騰的驟雨，從此將永葬在我的心底深處的呵！</p>

<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>過去生活留在記憶上的只有一點淡淡的影子，像一幅一幅褪色的古畫。</p>
<p>這褪色畫面上的淡淡的影子，不是人影，花影，月影，而是笑影和淚痕。</p>
<p>人爬到最高峯（不管是幸福的高峯或苦痛的高峯）的時侯，總喜歡回頭瞧瞧留有自己足印的途程，在這就要落到生活高峯的彼面的此刻，讓我也來瞧瞧留在後邊的笑影和淚痕吧。</p>
<p>……廳堂上，廊檐下，掛滿了輝煌的紗燈，燭光透過紅色的薄紗，照着滿堂的筵席，照着中堂三星的畫幅，照着兩旁紅地金字的壽屏，照着鮮紅的柱對，照着三星頭上鮮紅的報單，照出報單上的扁體黑字：貴府少爺×××在本小學肄業期滿考查成績合格准予畢業…</p>
<p>『恭喜恭喜，過幾年又是洋舉人了！』</p>
<p>矮胖的父親領着新袍新褂的兒子出現在廳堂的時候，全堂臉孔紅紅的酒客一齊站起身來。</p>
<p>……公園綠蔭叢中的小茅享裏。我和英合捧着詩集GoldenTreasure，合哼着名家出色的情詩。微風吹拂着柔媚的柳條，噝　作響，像密語，又像歎息。陽光穿過濃蔭的縫隙，落在亭邊的假山上，忽兒溜到這里，忽又溜到那里，像在偷看我們的舉勤，偷聽我們的密語似的。</p>
<p>『英，看！這陽光好像是你父親和我母親合派的密探，密探我們的行動的。』</p>
<p>『你眞是個懦怯的動物，處處聯想到家庭的障礙。忘了剛才讀過的沙翁的詩句嗎？愛情是可以穿過岩石的？』</p>
<p>『我們的愛情也可以穿過岩石嗎？』</p>
<p>『問題在於你！』</p>
<p>轉過臉，眼睛正對着她的眼睛。一個頭兒慢慢低下來，另一個跟着近上去。</p>
<p>……天空密佈着迷朦的雨綱，地上點綴着小小的水潭，在黃昏的薄暗中，急忽忽地步行着英和我。</p>
<p>『你眞的離開我嗎？不顧兩年同居情誼嗎？</p>
<p>『不是我要離開你，生活要我離開你。』</p>
<p>『生活不是可以改造的嗎？』</p>
<p>『正因為要改造生活，所以離開你。』</p>
<p>『不可以共同改造嗎？』</p>
<p>『不可以。你要把我從飢餓綫拖到死亡綫的。』</p>
<p>『絕對不能挽回了嗎？這是我最後一聲了。』</p>
<p>『不能，這是我半年考慮的結果。』</p>
<p>站住脚，瞧着英的影子漸漸消失在朦矓中了中。　　做夢似的回到鴿籠般的亭子間裏，出箱底的文憑，撕成無數的小蝴蝶，飛在地板上。</p>
<p>……鐵柵門裏，鷄欄特有的惡臭。</p>
<p>我閉着眼睛，浸在默想中，想着生和死。</p>
<p>鐵柵門嘩啦一聲響，心一跳，睜開眼睛，一隻手遞過一個罩在透明的白光紙裏的花旗麵包，『一個女人送給你的</p>
<p>接過來一瞧：白光紙上貼着一小方白報紙，寫着：『祝你健康！英。』</p>
<p>五分鐘內重度了過去三年的生活。眼角，有點濕了。</p>
<p>淡淡的笑影和淚痕呀！從今以後，我要把你們埋葬在遺忘中了。</p>

<h3 id="c230">嘉寶的「畫幕」失敗後為米高梅公司進一言 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 密箴</p>
<p>三個月以前，美國一家大報紙的記者，曾預言過，葛萊泰嘉寳已經到了一生事業的歧路了。她在她藝術生涯之中，已到了一個極危亟的時候。她在影界站到住，站不住，不久，就可以分曉了。如果她的「繡幕」（ThePaintedVeil）；不够一般美國觀衆，所期望於她的程度，她就不得不採取急劇的手段，去爭回她原有的地位。</p>
<p>三個月以前，記者亦曾讀過「繡幕」的故事，而為她歎息着。「繡幕」的故事，是根據於白人在中國廣東傳道，所遇到的種種威脅與危險。那的的確確、是一張侮辱我國國體和民族的片子。那裏面描寫着廣東某縣的厲疫橫行，死亡載道、官吏但知向木偶祈禱，而疫菌滋生的一個大堆棧，則不許加以焚燒，而那位傳道醫生，怎樣的拾身成仁的將那堆棧焚燒了，以至為當地的官吏紳士們所威脅而陷於種種危險。寫來好似中國還在極黑暗的菲洲似的。</p>
<p>當時我看了這段電影的故事，就深深歎了一口氣。我歎氣的原因很多，當然不止為一個葛萊泰嘉寳歎氣。我并且為美國最大的影片公司，米高梅，歎氣。我為美國人對於外國的知識的淺薄歎氣。我且為中美的邦交歎氣。美國接二連三的製造辱華影片將於何日底止呢？他們對於我們的觀念，何日可以有進展呢？他們不知道呢還是故意的不要知道呢？</p>
<p>美國的大公司，為了要拍攝一張取景於外國的影片，不惜派遣了大隊的人馬，跑到倫敦或都勃林，將十八世紀的衣飾用品，以至於門紐，酒瓶等瑣碎的東西，都搜集了帶回好萊塢以求影片內容的眞切。難道他們就不可以派一兩個生眼睛的人，到中國內地來看看，有沒有人烟輻輳之地，這樣厲疫橫生，死傷載道，而官吏紳士惟知禱告木偶，而沒有一個醫生出現的呢？</p>
<p>三個月以前，我就知道這種片子不會到中國來的。我想它來了亦好像「不怕死」一樣我們可以有所表示了。它不來，我們反覺無從表示起來了。果然它沒有來。非但沒有來到中國，並且在美國亦大大的失敗了。它在「近代銀慕」的分表中數，在許許多五顆星的鉅片排列之中，僅得到了三顆星，而最少的却還有兩願星。那比最蹩脚的影片，所以多一顆星的道理，恐怕還是嘉寳的威名的原故。</p>
<p>老實說，嘉寳在我們中國，除去受了一些美國宣傳的餘波，時時有譯文發表於中國電影刋物之外，我們根本就沒有崇拜過。我們所愛看的，從前有珍尼蓋諾，後來有瑙瑪希拉，麗琳哈蕙，現在有克勞黛考爾白，茂娜樂埃，洛蘭泰楊，茂琳奧莎麗文等等。雖然嘉寳從前在奈何天」和「克烈絲丁娜」等片中，有動人的成績，但是瑕瑜不相掩，我們對於她，或者亦因為她那寡婦式的面容，始終並不怎樣熱烈過。</p>
<p>一顆影星的沒落，是可悼惜的，但是在演了一張侮辱我們國體種族的影片之後，我們亦不過是人類，依着大類的天性，是應當為之欣快的但是攝製這張「辱華片」的當局，米高梅公司，究竟應當負何等的責任？米高梅出品，在中國的銷塲極廣，他們在上海有駐在的專人，希望他們能够因為這篇文字，而促成他們本國公司當局的注意，不然，卽使所攝製的片子，不一定能在中國放映，但在我們設切尋求隣國友誼之中，卽使不來，我們亦會知道和引起激烈的反感的。</p>

<p>陳查禮探案眞是太多了。在那些影片中，華納夏能所扮裝的中國偵探，一貫是沒有文法的英國話，再加上滯鈍的動作，作為笑料的提供。這　不能說他是有意侮辱華人，然而像這一樣的個性，加在一個智警的偵探身上，總覺得是不大適宜吧。不過我也不能不承認華納夏能是有着表演的聰明，以美國人來化裝中國人，能够抓住典型的表現，使中國人看來也覺得很像，這確是不容易的事。所以陳查禮探案之類，在中國能够引起觀衆的興趣，華納夏能是可以居功的。在「法京血案」，中的他，大部份的表演和以前沒有什麼兩樣，其中有一次坐上汽車，很自然的將　的邊沿拉了幾下，這摹擬了中國老頭兒的姿態，確是典型的表演。</p>
<p>「法京血案」的內容，和以前的陳查禮偵探片或其他的偵探影片相似，無非是陰好的人們，謀財害命，經過陳查禮的偵探，結果惡人服法。同時其中也不會沒有少男少女的愛情。所不同者這裹是表現了銀行經理僞造公債券，作奸犯科者，乃上流社會中人。當經理的假面具被揭破之後，這使「正人君子」們不免為之不寒而慄的。</p>
<p>但是在表現着的形象來說，人們决不會何等恭維的。一般的說，導演是陳舊的學習了常用的偵探片特有的手法，並無特殊可取之處。有幾塲戲的空氣，還抓得很緊，如在地窖內的種種。不過這種影片，人們是看得太多了，因此，並不覺得何等的興趣，雖然影片本身並不怎樣失敗。</p>

<h3 id="c232">評「小牧師」 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>“The　Little　Minlster”</p>
<p>—大上海映</p>
<p>在「交藝電影」攝製潮中，被製片商視作搖錢樹的作家，除了狄更司之外，巴雷SirJamesMatthewBarrie）也是一個。不久以前曾經有過在南京映出的「香閨秘密」（WhatHveryWomanKonws），這兒又是一張「小牧師」。</p>
<p>由於幾本舞臺劇的巳被翻譯與介紹，所以講到巴雷，在中國劇壇上巳不是十分生疎的人物了。他在一八六〇年生於蘇格蘭的吉利茂爾（Kirriemuir），二十二歲上從愛丁堡大學畢業後，就開始寫稿子，一八八九年以濃厚的地方色彩，與豐富的幽默，幻想和人道主義的同情表現蘇格蘭農民生活的小說（AWindowinThrums）露頭角後，接着就產生了許多小說，其中以這「小牧師」學他的巨著之一，奠定了他文壇上的地位。</p>
<p>和高爾司華綏一樣，巴雷是以小說家兼劇作者的，在「小牧師」發行後的不久，從各種劇本的寫作起，到一九二二年為止，劇作有三十五個之多。其中最重要的有「可敬的克萊登」，「彼得潘」，「香閨秘密」，「十二個金鎊的身價」和被洪深先生讀作「第二夢」的DearBrutus等。「小牧師」也在一八九七年被改作成劇本。</p>
<p>巴雷的劇作，被」些和他差不多同型的戲劇批評家如BarrettH．ClarkˉWilliamLyonphelps授等評價得極高的。說他是總滙了同時代諭劇作家的特點，他有高爾斯華綏之聰穎的理解，瓊司之道德的眞摯，約翰沁孤之深沉的熱情，鄧三南之卓越的幻想，伊爾文之倫理邏輯，蕭伯納的過人智慧，以及平內羅的技術等。自然這些巴電的特點我們是得承認的。但是當我們在他的劇作中還想找點什麼的時候，就會覺得缺少什麼了。他沒有如高爾斯華綏的正義感，蕭伯納的疾惡如仇，憂枝與葛利高萊夫人的不平的呼聽。除了「十二金鎊的身價」之稍微關聯對夫婦問題外，最多就止於「可敬的克萊登」中烏托邦式的禮　了。</p>
<p>巴雷在」香閨秘密」中他接觸到當時隨着質本主義與起的小市民層向上爬的事實，可是他却强調在他們的男女關係上來表現；在「小牧師」中也是由當時展開的紡織工業勃興中被奸商勾結之邵主的兵士所屠殺的織工，與被地主逐走的老窮婦蘭利等生活面，移到牧師和一個女子的戀愛糾紛上去了的。一個被岐視的告下賽民族的女子，會被身為人師的牧師那麼犧牲一切來垂愛，甚至被他所寄生的封君允許了結婚這事，不太幻想嗎？</p>
<p>在立卻華雷斯導演下的這「小牧師」影片，技術方面是頗可觀的。在文藝電影的競賽製作中，工切攝製中要素，從演員的選配，背景以及服裝導具的仿眞的，都不是草率從事。</p>
<p>充滿着素樸的蘇格蘭鄉野的風味，吉卜賽女郎的熱情的眼淚，以及幽默的小　刺，是一首淸麗可誦的牧歌，一節抒情的短詩，一幀風景的素描，也是一張速寫的漫畫。</p>
<p>演員中各人的成績都很平均，演醉漢羅道亞的蘭海爾，醫生麥坤的獨南爾克立普，老貧夫蘭利的曼利戈登，以及更夫母親等的技術都不遜於兩位主角。嚴格地說，女主角凱你玲赫本尙能把吉卜賽女郎巴白娜應有的熱情潑刺的性格發揮得够。扮小牧師的約翰比爾也是莊嚴沉靜的態度有餘，熱情奔放的表演却嫌不足。</p>

<p>— 志</p>
<p>但是那一天她知道了。她聽見一個小孩子在祈禱百上哭着求她離開這塊地方，因為人家都知道她和小牧師的事，倘若她再不離開，小牧師就被村人驅逐出境了。她於是傷心流淚，答應了永遠的離開這裏。那天晚上，她留了一張字條在蘭莉那裏給覺民。回到古堡裏，她就催促着和公爵結婚。在這種愁慘的心情裏，她連蘭莉也忘記了。當她的侍女提醒她的時候，她就忙着帶了錢去見她。她忍不住要問問關於覺民的消息。蘭莉告訴她道：「這幾天聽說覺民和平常有些兩樣。全村的人都注意着他。聽說是為了一個女人呢。巴白娜小姐，這恐怕不會是你吧，他是一位好牧師啊。……他來了。」</p>
<p>巴白娜忙躲住屋內，在小窗裏偷偷地看他。他灰自的面色，使她感到她的殘忍。她聽得他說。：「我實在不知道她發生了些什麼不幸的事。」那時敎堂的鐘響了，他連忙要走的說道：「這是祈禱會，我從來不遲到的。」可是蘭莉却故意呌他把那紡紗機搬進房子裏去。這一來，躱在房子裏的巴白娜，簡直是沒有地方避躱了。覺民於是緊抱着她說道；「你為什麼這樣子離開我呢？你眞不知道我怎樣難過啊。」她唯有解釋着說：「有些事情我要告訴你的‘」「你告訴我你愛我吧，這就够了。」</p>
<p>起初巴白娜忍着心說，她祇是和他玩，是尋開心。沒有別的意思的。但當她望着覺民那種失意的情形，她就不得不伏下來哭着道：「哦！不是的。起先恐怕是的。後來我是眞的愛你了。這是我的錯處。我不應這樣的，我不應給你和你的母親失面子。」小牧師問道：「你眞的愛我，而不是愛凌多爾公爵嗎？」「你還這樣問我嗎？」「那麼我們去和公爵講就好了。他會恕過你。」巴白娜搖着頭說道：「這辦不到的。你不認識他。他很有勢力，他會令到全村的人都來反對你的。」「那我會替我自己辯護的。我們不是相愛着嗎？我不能放棄你的。」他說着就要帶她回去見他的母親。可是祈禱會的衆集，不得不使他趕着回去。他囑她先去見他的母親。</p>
<p>巴白娜來到了他的房子。開門給她的不是覺民夫人，卻是琪恩。琪恩看見了她，很　　的責問她，不應當為了她而使小牧師被逐於敎堂。巴白娜正在辯護的時候，覺民夫人從樓上下來了。她知道巴白娜是兒子的愛人之後，她非特不發怒，還且很歡迎她，愛她。但是她那裏知道其他的事情呢？</p>
<p>巴白娜聽見了門外嘈雜的人聲，知道不妙。立刻設法使覺民夫人上了樓。她自己就去開門給敎堂裏來的長老。她哀惋地求他們不要直接的見覺民夫人，至少也求他們是說給她聽。湯姆士恕着的喝道：你不要不承認他今晚是用手摟抱過你。我們都已知道了。」「不，你都不知道。」她可怒着的退後說着：「就是你們知道了，這也不是一件壞事。他是不會幹這種事的，難道你們也不知嗎？」（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) This morning at 10:00 a.m. on the 18th, the National Government held a ceremony commemorating the eighth anniversary of the founding of the capital in Nanjing. Those present included Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Diaoyuan, Chen Shaokuan, Bai Wenwei, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Qicai, Chen Shuren, Wang Yongbin, Chen Xunyong, Cao Haosen, Lin Xiang, Chu Minyi, Chen Daqi, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhuo, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and others, as well as senior officers from various ministries and commissions, totaling approximately 800 people. After music was played and rituals were performed, Chairman Lin delivered a speech, briefly stating that today marks the eighth anniversary of the founding of the capital in Nanjing. Nanjing was once prosperous, but after the devastating destruction by Hong and Yang, the fields were barren, and traces of this still remain. When we established the capital here, we had to make do with what we had. After eight years of arduous efforts, new buildings are now visible everywhere. Furthermore, the construction of affordable housing areas is also actively underway. Nanjing is the capital of our country and is of great international importance. Therefore, all construction should be magnificent and dignified, fully in line with Eastern culture, in order to show a positive image to foreigners. In terms of science, libraries, medical schools, and the like should be vigorously established in the capital. In addition, the scenic beauty of the Qinhuai River should be preserved in its natural state and utilized with artificial and scientific methods to create a scenic area for the residents. The population of Nanjing has already increased to 800,000, and the construction needed is truly vast. Sun Yat-sen advocated establishing the capital in Nanjing because Beiping was corrupt and outdated. He hopes that all comrades will uphold Sun Yat-sen's legacy, work together, and ensure that the new construction of the capital continues to progress. After the speech, music was played, and the ceremony concluded. The entire group went to the front courtyard inside the main gate for a group photo, after which refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned. The staff of the National Government's Civil Affairs, Accounting, and Military Affairs departments changed the gathering place and had lunch at various locations due to the rain to celebrate.

<p>Guiyang: Our army, the Sun Column, has been fiercely suppressing the bandit Pseudo-135th Army Corps in the Huangni Shao Guanyin Mountain area for several days, capturing many prisoners. Starting from the 10th, they have been tailing the fleeing remnants of the bandits, pursuing them fiercely towards the Dingfan and Tonggupo areas of Zhongbai. After many fierce battles, over 3,000 bandits were scattered along the way. The Sun Column recovered Dingfan city on the 11th and Guangshun city on the 13th. The remnants of the bandits fled towards Ziyun. It is estimated that the bandits suffered over 4,000 casualties, with over 2,000 captured.

<p>Guiyang: Regarding the death of bandit leader Zhu De, it has now been reconfirmed that Wang Zhengxiang, a local villager from Shuitian Shou Township in Guanyang County, was captured by bandits while going to Xinchang and was forced to carry corpses through places such as Kelong Yangbao and Baini. He clearly heard the bandits saying, "Mr. Zhu (the bandits' term for him) died in battle at Zhujie Mountain this time." At the time, a bandit in a sedan saw Mr. Zhu's death and cried loudly. After much persuasion from several bandit officers, he stopped and immediately ordered the corpse to be wrapped in red silk and sent many soldiers to protect it. Along the way, a foul odor was heard. According to the coolies who carried the corpse, whenever the Red bandits stopped to rest, they would offer food, burn incense, and pay their respects. They would also silently pray, "Committee Member Zhu, bless us to break through Guizhou and send you back." They personally saw the silk inside the head of the corpse, and because of the shaking during transport, the lower half of the right ear was rubbed off, revealing the beard of a man of Ren Dan (probably a man who has experience). The face was swollen, and it was impossible to tell whether he was fat or thin. When a Red bandit saw the corpse's ear exposed, he beat the coolies violently and tied them with ropes.

<p>(Nanjing) The Muli Jiusuo Tusi (chieftain) in Southern Sichuan is located at the junction of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang and has always been under the jurisdiction of Yanyuan County in Sichuan Province. Recently, due to the issue of the Longda Gold Mine in Muli, a dispute arose with the troops of Liu Wenhui. Therefore, three representatives were specially sent to Nanjing to petition: Yue Wuye Da (representative of the three major monasteries in Muli), Xi Luo Jixiang (monastery representative), and Song Nuo Jize (representative of the Jiusuo people). They arrived yesterday. According to the representatives, the Tusi areas of Jiusuo in Muli have been at peace for over 300 years since the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. The local people are law-abiding and loyal. However, after Liu Wenhui's troops retreated to Ya'an in the 21st year, Ningyuan's eight counties were placed under their garrison. Because the troops took over the Longda Gold Mine, the mining performance was poor, and disputes arose with the Tusi, eventually leading to the death of the Tusi, Xiang Ci Cheng Zha Ba, and the imprisonment of the young Tusi, Zha Ba Song Dian, who has not yet been released. The Jiusuo people made a special decision through a general meeting to send representatives to Nanjing to petition, traveling over 10,000 li via Shanghai to Nanjing. They will soon petition the Executive Yuan and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the National Government, requesting relief. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

The Beining and Jinpu Railway Bureaus had prepared vehicles, which were withdrawn from Yangcun and Cangxian on the night of the 17th. According to sources, the delay in the special police shift is still due to the unresolved issue of the security commander. Before the command authority is determined, it is difficult to provide aid for the time being. It is expected that after Yin Tong returns from Japan, the Clearing Committee will be reconvened to decide everything and a military ruling body will be organized, following the example of the administrative commissioners of Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces concurrently serving as security commanders.

The security and militia groups in the Ao-Yu area will implement a joint defense system. When any security team encounters bandit alarms, they will dispatch troops to block and suppress them, regardless of defense boundaries.

Liu visited Tao Shangming in Tangshan on the 17th from Ao to report on the recent situation of the team and discuss issues such as the exchange of defense and local security after the new security team enters. Liu, because the inspection commissioner of the War Zone Clearing Committee will soon arrive in Tangshan and will discuss summer defense issues with Zhao Lei, Feng Shoupeng, and others, will stay for three or four days before returning to Luan. Liu said that the issue of the new security team entering the war zone has been agreed upon by all parties, but there is no definite date yet.

<p>(Nanjing) The labor representative of our country attending the 19th International Labour Conference has been appointed as Wang Jinxia, a dock worker from Hankou. He arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on the 18th to prepare to go abroad at the end of the month. Wang said that the labor issue is a matter of equality for working people in terms of life and culture, as well as a matter of belief and responsibility to the country and nation. The needs of workers in our country today focus particularly on the awakening of national consciousness and the training of life skills. The International Labour Conference is a progressive way to promote international labor friendship. I plan to have two proposals. One is to prevent dumping policies to protect the lives of workers and the benefits they are entitled to. Dumping is enough to cause international moral problems and is unreasonable from a social point of view. Our country's industry and workers suffer the most from this impact, so I especially request discussion. The other case is still under consideration. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Since the United States implemented its silver purchasing policy, artificially raising silver prices, the international currency war has become increasingly acute. China's silver reserves have been flowing out, creating an unprecedented massive surplus of silver exports. Although the government has implemented silver export taxes and balancing taxes to curb this trend, the sharp decline in silver reserves has caused social panic, credit contraction, and tight money. On the eve of the conclusion of the last National Assembly, the depth of the panic and the bleakness of the situation were rarely seen since the founding of the Republic. As a result, for several months, both the banking and money industries have uniformly tightened lending to preserve their strength and prepare for future difficulties. However, national goods industries and businesses, already suffering from the impact of the devaluation and dumping of foreign goods, now feel the pain of capital turnover and adjustment. The market has become stagnant, commodities have lost their circulation, and the unemployment problem has worsened. Such a recession is not a blessing for the future of national goods industries. National goods manufacturers and various national goods organizations in this city, aware of this situation, have initiated mutual aid and self-help movements, organizing groups such as the Joint Market, National Goods Alliance, and Citizens' National Goods Consumption Alliance. They are studying issues such as improving products, standardizing retail and wholesale prices, and developing foreign trade. Their efforts are commendable. However, in my opinion, the past promotion of national goods has not been perfect. I dare to offer my humble opinions.</p>
<p>China's national goods promotion movement has a long history. However, based on past experiences, it lacked an overall plan and a clear objective. The general opinion was that all national products should be promoted, and national goods manufacturers merely took advantage of the opportunity to promote their products. Once popular, they did not hesitate to cut corners to seek huge profits, disregarding the loss of credibility of national goods. Therefore, although the call for promoting national goods has been repeatedly raised, the results have been minimal. I believe that the national goods promotion movement is the only effective remedy for saving China. If used properly, it can bring the dead back to life. Otherwise, its effect will only be temporary excitement, merely creating opportunities for a small number of manufacturers. It should be understood that although China has been diligently promoting national goods in recent years, the import and sale of foreign goods have increased rather than decreased. Pessimists attribute this to the failure of the national goods movement. In fact, the types of foreign goods imported today are different from those in the past. Taking textiles as an example, in the early years of the Republic, the import of coarse cloth was the main category. In recent years, due to changes in social customs and the widespread sales of our own products, it has shifted from coarse cloth to fine cloth and wool textiles. From this perspective, if we loudly advocate for the promotion of domestically produced coarse cloth without seeking to save the massive imports of fine cloth and wool textiles, the lack of effectiveness can be easily predicted. Therefore, promoting national goods requires a thorough study of the import situation of foreign goods first, and then selecting the key ones, distinguishing between urgency, and promoting them one by one. For those that already have substitutes, technical improvements should be planned to reduce costs and assist in their promotion. As for those that currently have no substitutes, we should immediately take action, gather national talents, and divide the work to study imitation and stimulate investment interest. If we follow this approach, promoting several types each year, over time, not only will the results be considerable, but the foundation of national goods can also be expected to be consolidated. As the saying goes, "It takes a hundred years to cultivate a person." I believe that the completion of national goods promotion also requires this particularly long-term spirit, otherwise it will not succeed.</p>

<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations Council passed the resolution proposed by France condemning Germany for violating the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, it immediately appointed representatives from Canada, Chile, Spain, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia to form a committee to consider plans to make the League of Nations Covenant more effective in the collective security organization and to ensure compliance with international instruments on which peace depends. Chu Nai announced the adjournment of the session. The next meeting is scheduled for May 20, and it is expected that the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia will be discussed at that time. British Foreign Secretary Simon has already left for Paris tonight and plans to fly back to London tomorrow morning. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government has protested against the attitude taken by the United Kingdom at the Stresa Conference and the League of Nations Council. British Ambassador to Germany Phipps was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last night. Since Foreign Minister Neurath was not in Berlin, he was received by Deputy Foreign Minister Bülow, who lodged an oral protest in the name of the German government regarding the British attitude. According to reports, the British and Italian ambassadors to Germany sent copies of the Stresa Conference communiqué to the German government yesterday, regarding the reaffirmation of the obligations of the Locarno Treaty by the United Kingdom and Italy. At that time, the German government requested a clear explanation of this communiqué, especially whether the United Kingdom and Italy would treat Germany the same as they would treat France if they fulfilled the provisions of the Locarno Treaty if France invaded Germany. British Ambassador Phipps and Italian Ambassador Cerruti immediately replied in person in accordance with the spirit of the Stresa Conference communiqué. No communiqué regarding this meeting was issued by Berlin. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since the League of Nations Council passed a resolution condemning Germany's rearmament, German newspapers have been unanimously indignant and protesting. German newspapers claim that the League of Nations has no legal basis for this move, and that the bridge between the League of Nations and Germany has been completely dismantled. The responsibility for rebuilding this bridge rests entirely with the League of Nations itself. As for Poland's attitude, Polish Foreign Minister Beck issued a declaration on Tuesday stating that Poland felt more stable today than ever before. However, when the League of Nations voted, Poland sided with the majority. It is unknown what changes in international relations occurred during this short period, but it is conceivable that it is related to Poland's unilateral declaration to abolish the minority treaties. Furthermore, according to German newspapers, the official declaration of the German government regarding the League of Nations' condemnation case will be decided after clarifying whether the voting countries have any auxiliary declarations. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political circles commented on the League of Nations Council's unanimous passage yesterday of the resolution proposed by France condemning Germany's reintroduction of military service, stating that Germany could not recognize the Council as an organization with the authority to judge events in which it was involved. Therefore, Germany does not regard the Council's judgment as generally valid. The action in Geneva is seen as prolonging tensions in Europe and making Germany's return to the League of Nations even more distant. One political commentator said that France has severed the line of European negotiations, just as it forced Germany to withdraw from the League of Nations. Germans were deeply surprised by Simon's attitude at the Council yesterday, as he had frankly discussed everything with Hitler in Berlin. The Germans are not very angry with Poland, believing that Poland was forced to agree. The news of the Council's passage of the resolution has been telegraphed to Hitler, who is currently in southern Germany. Before Hitler returns to Berlin on the 19th for his birthday, Germany will not make any decision on how to deal with it, or the parliament should hold a national referendum to show Germany's unity. Political circles do not think so, saying that Germany's unity has already been proven. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov held a meeting today to finalize the outline of the Franco-Soviet agreement. The wording of the agreement will be finalized after consulting with both governments. According to reports, the main points of the Franco-Soviet agreement stipulate that France and the Soviet Union will jointly request the League of Nations Council to submit a proposal to increase the effectiveness of Articles 10, 16, and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant. The principles of the agreement were discussed by Laval and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin a week ago, but some details remained unresolved. After the Laval-Litvinov meeting tonight, all difficulties have been eliminated. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Reports state that French Foreign Minister Laval and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov held an important meeting in Geneva yesterday afternoon, lasting four hours, to discuss the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, with legal experts from both countries participating. Laval returned to Paris today and will submit the draft agreement to the Cabinet meeting tomorrow for approval. It is also reported that the agreement will be initialed on Saturday. A telegram from the Geneva correspondent of the Morning Post confirms that Laval has successfully persuaded Litvinov to abandon the claim that the mutual assistance clause should take effect automatically. Therefore, if there is a need for assistance in the future, it should first be submitted to the League of Nations Council. The Council will convene a meeting within 24 hours if necessary, granting the countries concerned the freedom to act or reject it. (18th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The outline and details of the Franco-Soviet agreement have been agreed upon. The Morning Post reports that Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov originally intended for the mutual assistance system to be mechanically applied, but was persuaded by Foreign Minister Laval to abandon this idea. The Business Post reports that Poland is willing to continue its military alliance with France and amend the treaty to enable a completely mechanical application. Various newspapers commented on Turkey's request to abolish the military clauses of the Treaty of Lausanne. Le Journal stated, "Turkey's request to re-establish defensive works in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits is the most reasonable interpretation of the right to equal defense. Turkey has also clearly stated that free navigation will still be allowed after the straits are rearmed, which shows its goodwill." The Business Post stated, "Turkey's intention is that if the major powers can allow the Dardanelles Strait to be rearmed, the Balkan Entente countries can also agree to Bulgaria's rearmament, which is logical." (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü, and French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Léger all visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. The Romanian Foreign Minister hosted a banquet for Litvinov, which was attended by representatives of the Little Entente. Later, Litvinov visited French Foreign Minister Laval. (17th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) During the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council in Geneva to discuss the French protest and resolution, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov said, "This issue may seem different in form for the relations between the member states of the League of Nations, but in reality, it definitely requires the attention of the League of Nations. Not only did the Soviet Union not participate in the Treaty of Versailles, but in general, it does not approve of this treaty, including Germany's disarmament. The Soviet Union's formal attitude towards this issue is as follows: We are members of the League of Nations and the Council. Now, someone is still formally a member of the League of Nations, but they have brazenly violated international treaties, which is no different from violating the League of Nations Covenant. As a result, their obligations to other member states have also been violated, creating a threat to peace. The League of Nations Covenant must first pay attention to whether a certain country is complying with its international obligations. Although I do not emphasize the form of this issue at first, I want to emphasize its reality. All countries have equal rights, and all countries have the undeniable right to protect themselves and take various measures to ensure this security. However, we recognize that the equality of armaments rights is based on an assumption, that is, this type of armament is only used as a means to defend its existing borders and security. But if the concrete facts have raised questions about this assumption, then what shall we do? In other words, if the purpose of armament is not to protect borders, but to invade borders, to use violent means to implement its revenge ideas, to destroy the security of neighboring countries and distant lands, to destroy world peace, and to let its tragic consequences descend upon the world, then what shall we do? At the same time, if there is a country whose leaders openly declare that their foreign policy is not only aimed at revenge, but also at the unlimited conquest of other people's territories and the destruction of the independence of various countries, and at the same time this policy is not only not revoked, but even constantly propagated to indoctrinate its people, if this is the case, then what shall we do when it demands or even realizes the right to rearm itself? If there is a country that has the above-mentioned plans, and its leaders are unwilling to guarantee that their plans will not be realized, unwilling to guarantee the safety of their neighbors near and far, unwilling to provide other countries with the guarantees that they are prepared to provide (including countries that are not suspected of having aggressive ambitions), then what shall we do? Can we turn a blind eye to these facts? We must obviously have a special attitude towards these facts."</p>
<p>Litvinov, in order to fully explain, compared international life to a city. Someone in a certain city privately hides weapons and publicly kills residents in neighboring streets or distant streets. Then, he asks the municipal authorities, saying that he is willing to protect a part of the area, so that it will not be trampled on, but the rest of the area is allowed to use force freely. Is the municipal authority willing to consider his "allowance"? "What we require of the League of Nations is to defend international life in all parts of the world, and we must not let go of the factors that create threats to peace."</p>
<p>Litvinov finally stated that if the country concerned can also attend and participate in the Council's current meeting, and can listen to its formal statement, abolish its policy of violent revenge and conquering others, and declare its willingness to participate in a collective organization to protect the security of all countries (including itself), then it will be overjoyed, "But this kind of hope cannot be realized after all, which is a pity. We must draw our conclusions, and what determines our attitude towards this resolution is these conclusions, and not just its formal motives. This attitude is by no means that the Treaty of Versailles and its various clauses that have already been broken are reasonable. This expresses the efforts of our Soviet government to create an international order to make it difficult to break peace. Only in this way can we conclude such treaties." (18th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German semi-official agency German Foreign Policy Commentary has responded to the anti-German remarks made by Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov at the League of Nations Council, stating that "Soviet Russia has nothing to seek in Geneva, and this has reached its extreme due to Litvinov's declaration. Litvinov's declaration, at first glance, does not seem to be for the purpose of being announced in Geneva, but for the recent US General Assembly. In any case, Litvinov's remarks are more suitable for the Soviet Union's People's Representative Assembly than for the League of Nations, because the League of Nations still claims to be the supreme judicial organ of civilized countries in the world. Litvinov's communist speech, its ability to incite hatred against national socialist Germany, can be compared with various conspiracies brewed by Moscow in other countries. Because Soviet Russia intends to systematically harm any country, and in order to prevent this kind of harm, countries around the world must organize large teams of secret detectives to declare war on Moscow's disturbers of the peace. Litvinov is not unaware of this, so he shamelessly occupies the position of commenting on others, and his shamelessness is astonishing. Litvinov's slanders and insults against Germany did not cause any protests on the part of the League of Nations, which can prove the spirit of the resolution. Indeed, when the League of Nations submitted the resolution for a vote, it had already determined its identity. As for Germany, people all over the country are questioning whether Geneva's actions will be beneficial to future continued negotiations." (18th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e34">MacDonald's Speech Urges Germans to Compromise; The Existence of the League of Nations Depends on Peacemakers; To Maintain Peace, Great Sacrifices Must Be Prepared <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald gave a radio speech here tonight, describing the events of the Stresa Conference, and strongly urged the German people to contribute appropriately to the construction of mutual trust in coordination with other countries. MacDonald said that the German people should know how deeply their sympathetic friends felt pain when dealing with their worries recently. Britain did not bear any new responsibilities at the Stresa Conference. He dared to say that if the spirit of the Stresa Conference could be maintained and all its resolutions could be implemented, it would definitely be of great help in eliminating the haze and seeing the sun again. MacDonald then explained the difference between peace lovers and peacemakers, saying that the continued existence of the League of Nations and its success depend on peacemakers. Peacemakers must cater to the facts. He knew that loving peace and dreaming of peace were not enough. He deeply felt that for the sake of peace and for the sake of all great principles, he must be prepared to make sacrifices, and even great sacrifices, because he must deal with all the difficulties in the world. A large part of the world does not yet have an eager desire for peace. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Lower House opposition leader Lansbury requested Prime Minister MacDonald to report on the events in Stresa and Geneva. When answering, MacDonald expressed his approval of the League of Nations Council's resolution condemning Germany. MacDonald claimed that the League of Nations' action was a necessary measure after "Germany's attack on peace," and said that Germany's armament requirements and the way it announced these requirements greatly influenced the entire conversation, because "the reason we went to Stresa was to consider past policies and declarations in view of the decline in the status quo." MacDonald solemnly declared that Britain's only obligation was to be prepared to consult at any time when Austria's independence was in danger, and that Britain's policy was still based on the League of Nations Covenant. MacDonald concluded, "The representatives of the three countries participating in the Stresa Conference not only did not split due to various difficulties, but also united to find a peaceful solution to the current crisis."

<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations resolved yesterday to condemn Germany's rearmament and violation of the Treaty of Versailles, it has now fallen into a maze of countless international disputes. The League of Nations now needs to consider the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The plan supported by Britain, France, and Italy allows Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria to immediately double their armies and restore conscription.</p>
<p>(2) Yugoslavia and Romania, seeing that their neighbors have been allowed to lift treaty restrictions, will also demand increased armaments.</p>
<p>(3) The Soviet Union requires sanctions to be applied to the whole world, its purpose being in the Far East and Japan.</p>
<p>(4) Turkey may request to amend the Treaty of Neuilly, so that it can restore defense in the Tartar Strait.</p>
<p>(5) Reconciling the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The resolution passed by the League of Nations stipulates that a special committee will be formed to formulate "several most effective methods to establish a security organization in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant, and especially to plan economic and financial sanctions methods, so that they can be implemented in the future against any country that directly betrays treaties and endangers peace." The League of Nations' passage of this resolution this time is generally regarded as a great victory for France over Germany. Poland's participation in the vote is truly surprising. It is still remembered that a few days ago, Polish Army Minister Pilsudski declared that Poland was unwilling to sign any treaty that would harm its feelings with Russia and Germany. However, Pilsudski's remarks were informal expressions during his conversation with British Lord Privy Seal Eden. It is learned here that the Berlin newspapers are attacking the League of Nations resolution fiercely, and express that this act is nothing more than the League of Nations' consistent policy of discriminating against Germany. It is said that President Hitler and his advisors are preparing to submit a formal protest to the League of Nations Council next week. (18th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) The most sensational espionage case in France since the Great War concluded its trial today. Twenty-one individuals, including two American spouses named Switz, were found guilty of leaking military secrets. However, the Switz couple have been released due to the relatively minor nature of their offenses. A Russian national named Stahl, 48, believed to be a Russian spy, was sentenced to five years in prison. Several others received sentences ranging from one to five years. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Stahl and his thirty accomplices, accused of supplying military secrets to Soviet Russia, have been sentenced. Stahl received a five-year prison sentence, a fine of three thousand francs, and a five-year ban from residing in France. Former Colonel Mauling and Romanian Berkovec also received similar sentences, as they had been receiving monthly payments of four thousand francs for leaking blueprints of tanks and military telephone equipment. Stahl vehemently denied his guilt, claiming he only assisted a teacher named Mehmet in purchasing photographic equipment, resulting in a three-year sentence. An American couple named Switz received ninety-five thousand francs, but they were spared punishment due to a "Royal Certificate." Eleven individuals remain at large, including a translator for Naval Captain Martin. The remaining nine were sentenced to prison terms ranging from ten months to four years.

The investigation results of the commission have a close relationship to the future market of Japanese cotton textiles, so it is worthy of attention from the Japanese government.

Upon returning to Jinan, he stated that there are 24,477 fishing households, 15,122 fishing boats, and an annual fish production of 104,962,719,700 jin, valued at over 500 million. In recent years, production has been nearly halved due to the impact of Japanese fishing boats and insufficient fish salt supply. In the past, sales extended as far as Hong Kong and the Northeast. However, due to customs restrictions, ships under twenty tons are not allowed to export, resulting in a significant reduction. The annual demand for fish salt is over one million dan, but the Salt Transport Office only allows the release of 420,000 dan, which is insufficient for use. This is a major reason for the decline of the fishing industry. The Provincial Government has decided to comprehensively coordinate relief measures. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>— German Correspondence</p>
<p>Negotiations Show No Effect; German-French Conflicts Are Still Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>The Anglo-German negotiations, which have attracted worldwide attention, finally took place on March 24. British Foreign Secretary Simon, accompanied by Under-Secretary Eden, formally visited Berlin. This is the first time since the National Socialist Party came to power that they have been graced with the attention of a British gentleman. If it were two years ago, it would have been considered a strange tale for the British Foreign Secretary to pay a visit to Hitler with the honors due to a head of state and to conduct negotiations between the two countries. This situation is similar to that of Mussolini ten years ago and Stalin three years ago. The world has truly changed too quickly, forcing British politicians to change their traditional gentlemanly attitude. Why are Hitler's prices different morning and evening? Two years ago, not only was he seen as a buffoon, but more importantly, Germany did not have the backing of strength. Today, Hitler is still Hitler, but Germany's military preparations have caught up with France. We know that there is no "justice" or "reason" in the international arena. There is only "power," and "power" is better than everything.</p>
<p>According to the official British announcement, the mission of Simon and his party is to discuss the scope based on the London agreement of February 3, to unblock the opinions between Germany and France, and to consolidate peace in Europe. However, after the German government implemented conscription on March 16 and openly rearmed, the French attitude turned to complaining to Britain. Simon then stated that his visit to Berlin only contained the opinion of the German government as a preliminary step to resolving the entire European problem in the future, and that it was not a unilateral British action, and that there would be no tendency for Britain and Germany to directly conclude a treaty. This has temporarily eased France's threat -- the slogan "Otherwise, we (France) will go to Moscow".</p>
<p>French newspapers, before Simon's trip, said "Why bother with an empty trip." Simon himself also felt that he knew there was no hope, but for the sake of "peace", he had to go and see. It can be seen that the conditions put forward by both Germany and France are very harsh, and Simon does not have the power to make a certain aspect surrender. After two consecutive days of direct talks in Berlin, Simon returned to London according to the scheduled itinerary. The official announcements from both Britain and Germany believe that the negotiations were very effective. But what is the effect? According to Simon, he has an extremely pleasant impression of Hitler. On the other hand, he has a full understanding of Germany's demands. This is truly the tone of a first-class diplomat.</p>
<p>Many people feel that Germany has famous soldiers but no outstanding diplomats. This is correct. Hitler is full of the atmosphere of a warrior and has no diplomatic demeanor. This is also correct. However, Germany has one point that is the same as Japan and Soviet Russia. It not only knows how to use military force as a diplomatic backing but also understands how to take advantage of opportunities. For example, Hitler's words and Litvinov's words are in inverse proportion, but they can both cause headaches for the British because the speaker has an inviolable strength behind him. It is said that when Hitler and Simon talked about the issue of Austrian independence, Hitler said, "Why doesn't Britain come to sign this 'non-interference treaty' itself?" Such remarks naturally violate diplomatic conventions. Unfortunately, we do not know how Simon responded, otherwise, it would be more interesting to compare. In short, according to the news from the diplomatic community, Hitler's attitude towards various issues was very firm and straightforward, and he directly rebuked Simon. As a result of everyone's mutual verbal battle, both sides have their own reasons, so it is still the same as before the negotiations, and there is no possibility of convergence. What Simon said, he has an extremely pleasant impression of Hitler, if it refers to this, then, the attitude of a gentleman is not something that we ordinary people can guess.</p>
<p>The central issues of this negotiation are as follows: (1) Eastern European Pact. Britain's attitude is based on the London Agreement, linking various treaties, Eastern Europe, Danube, and Aviation, into three pacts. Germany advocates separation, especially for the Eastern European Pact, believing that there is no possibility of signing a treaty. Germany is unwilling to be bound by being connected with Soviet Russia in this treaty. The German newspapers have expressed this very firmly, recognizing that Germany has no problems on the western border, but the eastern part cannot be so careless and there must be a fair solution. (2) Danube Pact. Although Germany does not fundamentally oppose it, it proposes a condition, which is to add a practical definition to "non-interference". This means that Germany is not allowed to interfere in Austria, but other countries (referring to Italy) are also not allowed to interfere, and Britain must be a guarantor in this regard. (3) Aviation Pact. This was originally a treaty for Britain to mediate the conflict between Germany and France, and a concession to Germany. Germany naturally agrees, but Germany still has an attached condition, demanding equal rights for the air force. (4) Returning to the League of Nations. Germany believes that as long as Germany fully obtains equal rights in armaments, it can return to Geneva at any time. Britain, however, believes that it should return to Geneva first, and then everyone will discuss a solution in the League of Nations. (5) Abolishing conscription. Britain hopes that the German government will voluntarily abolish conscription first, and then everyone will jointly discuss a practical disarmament plan to limit the troop quotas of various countries. Germany believes that there is no room for compromise on this point. (6) Treaty issue. Britain advocates combining various treaties and not separating them individually, and the foundation of peace will be built on this. Germany advocates first concluding treaties individually and hopes that a Anglo-German treaty will be established immediately between Britain and Germany before extending to others. (7) Armaments issue. Britain advocates that Germany's armaments should be reduced to at least below France's current military strength. Conversely, Germany advocates that Germany's armaments must be equal to those of Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Combining the above issues, we will see that both British and German celebrities are firmly guarding their positions and are unwilling to compromise in the slightest. A Swiss reporter put it well, "Are there any results from the Anglo-German negotiations?" Yes, if there were no negotiations, the important people of the two countries would have no opportunity to contact each other, have friendly relations, and talk freely. In addition, they would not be able to use their spare time to sit together at dinners. Is the friendship of important people not necessary? What else can we ask for?</p>
<p>In fact, most of these issues are still superficial. The so-called treaties, the League of Nations, disarmament, etc., are nothing more than diplomatic tricks. In the eyes of us laymen, everyone is making a lot of noise, so it is easy to be deceived by them, thinking that these gentlemen are really arguing for the sake of "treaties". Unfortunately, the fact is not the case. For example, the Eastern European Pact is a front set up by France and Russia, with the military strength of France and Russia as the backing. If Germany attacks one side, the two countries will "justifiably" send troops to attack from the front and back. For example, the Danube Pact is France's recognition of Italy's special status in Austria. If Germany's power invades Austria again, everyone will unite and use force to stop it. Germany is naturally unwilling to put itself in a ring drawn by others, giving others an excuse to send troops to attack itself. Therefore, everyone makes a big fuss about "treaties". As for their original intention, in other words, France wants to maintain the status quo, so it uses various methods to bind Germany. Germany wants to break the status quo, so it confronts France's policies step by step. The last way is naturally for everyone to use strength to solve the problem.</p>
<p>As a result of the Berlin negotiations, Britain obviously did not get any advantage. Not only is the contradiction between Germany and France impossible to resolve, but also the anti-Russian front, because of France's opposition -- French newspapers issued a warning during Simon's stay in Berlin. France firmly opposes any plans that directly or indirectly oppose Soviet Russia, and there does not seem to be much hope for Germany's excessive demands. So, from Britain's standpoint, it was truly an empty trip.</p>
<p>As for Germany's attitude, it is still pragmatic and taking steps step by step. Since Simon came to Berlin, the anti-Russian atmosphere in Germany has suddenly become more intense. All parties are very enthusiastically discussing Soviet Russia's military preparations, believing that eastern Germany is already a dangerous zone, and Soviet Russia's powerful Red Army is enough to threaten Germany's safety. For the sake of self-defense, Germany has the need to equalize its military preparations with Soviet Russia. This means that what Germany is demanding is not only 500,000 standing troops, being equal to France is considered satisfactory, but a further preparation to expand to one million. In terms of strength, it will be equal to Soviet Russia. This not only shocked France, but even experienced diplomats such as British Foreign Secretary Simon probably cannot help but frown.</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation in Europe, the anxious person is naturally not Germany. Germany has made full preparations in the past two years and is only waiting for the development of the situation. The "anti-Russian war" is probably not opposed by France, and Germany itself has to consider it. It is naturally difficult for a large army to penetrate deep into Soviet Russia without first resolving the Czech Republic and Poland. On the other hand, after all, the Czech Republic and Poland have a direct and personal interest in Germany, and they are also close neighbors. Why should Germany abandon what is near and seek what is far away? In addition, the cadres of the German National Defense Forces and the cadres of the Soviet Russian Red Army have always had close cooperation. General von Blomberg, the current Minister of National Defense of Germany, is said to have been given the position of Minister purely because he has a good relationship with the Soviet Russian Red Army. If we put aside the doctrine, then geographically, Germany will need the help of Soviet Russia in future wars. Moreover, it is said that German General Ludendorff had the news of being appointed as Chief of Staff during the European War, so there may be different opinions between anti-Russian and pro-Russian factions in the party and the military. The French saw this crisis, so Laval expressed that regardless of whether Germany joins or not, France has decided to conduct the Eastern European Treaty with Soviet Russia first. This is naturally equivalent to France and Russia concluding a military alliance. If this plan is really realized, then Germany will be in a situation of being attacked from both sides militarily, and development will not be easy. At present, the anti-Russian atmosphere in Germany may have other functions, otherwise, the many efforts spent by German military experts over the years will probably not have the opportunity to be realized, because France's powerful assistant is neither Britain nor Italy, but Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia can influence Germany and France in future wars. If the anti-Russian front really fails, then Soviet Russia's political status in Europe will become more important.</p>
<p>On April 11, diplomats from Britain, France, and Italy decided to meet in Stresa, northern Italy, to discuss the German issue. Based on past experience, we are told that this conference will not have much result. Britain, France, and Italy have different interests, so how can they unite?</p>
<p>In the meantime, what is worth noting is that Lithuania actually sentenced four leaders of the Memel National Socialist Party to death in the Memel lawsuit. This caused fierce opposition from Germany. In theory, Lithuania is a small country, how dare it "try to stop a chariot with a mantis arm" and anger Germany. Since his attitude dares to be so strong, then things are not necessarily very simple. In addition, the Little Entente and the Balkan Alliance are also preparing to hold a meeting in the Romanian capital. Their purpose is naturally to discuss a way to deal with Germany.</p>
<p>The war clouds in Europe are getting closer, and what we cannot know is only the time of the outbreak. (March 28 in Germany)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Kong Xiangxi's Report: The Closing of the Guantai Breach – and a Plan to Address Both Symptoms and Root Causes – <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the National Economic Council's Water Conservancy Committee, reported to the Central Political Conference on the 17th regarding the closing of the Guantai breach in the Yellow River and a plan to address both symptoms and root causes. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the report on the closure of the Guantai breach in the Yellow River and the difficult circumstances of the embankment construction, I, Xiangxi, previously made a temporary report at the 447th meeting on March 6th regarding the critical situation of the Yellow River breach at Changyuan, and requested discussion of relief measures. The meeting resolved that the National Economic Council and the Ministry of Finance should jointly discuss relief measures and raise the necessary funds. Funds were promptly allocated to expedite the work and complete the project. Recently, Kong Xiangrong, Standing Committee Member and Director of the Relief Work Group of the National Economic Council's Water Conservancy Committee, telegraphed that the Guantai breach had been closed at Chenshi (7-9 AM) on the 11th of this month. The difficult circumstances of the process are detailed below:</p>
<p>Previous Embankment Construction</p>
<p>Investigations revealed that the Yellow River breach, directly impacting the Changyuan Jiugu Road area, had four openings. These were all dry-season breaches that Director Zhou Xiangshi of the former Engineering and Accounting Group assigned to Sun Qingze, Director of the Second District Engineering Office, for embankment construction. After Director Zhou resigned due to illness, Director Kong Xiangrong took over. In addition to closing the Fenglou water opening, which had already diverted the entire main current, he also used the remaining funds allocated for the project to reinforce and heighten the embankment in the Shitouzhuan area at the request of the Hebei Provincial Government, with large vehicles transporting materials. After the completion of the work, including the previous projects, the Executive Yuan and the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, together with representatives from the Hebei Provincial Government, inspected and handed over the embankment section by section. The Hebei Provincial Government instructed its departments to take over the management, and reported the matter to the Executive Yuan for record. This was the process of the vigorous embankment construction after the breach the year before last.</p>
<p>Reasons for Subsequent Breaches</p>
<p>After the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee's Relief Work Group completed the embankment project, preparations were made for its closure. The group telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government requesting it to select appropriate personnel to station at the work site for defense, and advised them to urgently construct culverts and protective dikes along the embankment for defense. The Hebei Provincial Government replied that the Hebei River Affairs Bureau would be responsible for the subsequent defense. However, by mid-August, the river water rose again, and the Hebei River Affairs Bureau and the Post-Disaster Engineering Office failed to implement the important tasks mentioned in the telegram, resulting in four more breaches. Water seeped in through the base of the old embankment, but the water level was still about two meters below the top of the embankment and the main current of the river had not yet directly impacted it. At that time, only one deputy section chief of the River Affairs Bureau was present on the embankment with six river soldiers and thirty boatmen. Without any other laborers, it was a complete joke to try to protect this 20-li (approx. 6.2 miles) embankment with just over thirty people, causing the embankment that had been painstakingly built over the year to collapse again. A request was submitted to the Executive Yuan for strict investigation and punishment. These were the reasons for the subsequent breaches after the Changyuan opening was closed last year.</p>
<p>Situation Before Transfer to the Water Conservancy Committee</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Executive Yuan resolved to order the Hebei Provincial Government to dismiss and investigate Sun Qingze, the bureau chief, and instructed the Hebei River Affairs Bureau to undertake the embankment construction under the supervision of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, in accordance with the four relief measures proposed by the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee's Relief Work Group. At that time, since the areas near the openings were all submerged, the blockage work started at Guantai. The Hebei River Affairs Bureau drafted a plan, which was reviewed and approved by the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee's Relief Work Group and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, and a deadline of one month was set for Hua Deming, the new director of the River Affairs Bureau, to complete the closure. This was the situation before the Relief Work Group was transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Economic Council's Water Conservancy Committee.</p>
<p>Perilous Situation of the Breach</p>
<p>After the group was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Water Conservancy Committee in February of this year, it was reported that as of December 18th of last year, only 64 meters of the 781-meter breach remained. At that time, the water was relatively calm and it was easier to block. However, Director Hua Deming of the River Affairs Bureau delayed the work under the pretext of purchasing and transporting materials, failing to gather them on time, and had to suspend the work to wait. Despite the Relief Work Group's best efforts to assist, transporting materials on his behalf, providing guidance on the blocking strategy, and urging him to expedite the work and complete the project on time, the more they urged, the more he ignored. As a result, he missed the three good opportunities to close the breach before the winter solstice in the old lunar calendar and before the new year in the old lunar calendar. Moreover, according to the successive reports from Ji Jianchuang of Hebei, the daily work reports of Director Hua only stated how many meters a certain dam had advanced and been raised, without any reports of breaches. Only after inspecting the work site did they learn that half of the reported work was just makeshift reinforcement and that the repeated breaches had not been truthfully reported. When Director Hua Deming's resignation was approved and Qi Shouan was appointed to replace him, the opening had already been scoured to a depth of 29 meters, diverting 80% of the river's flow, and the work situation became increasingly dangerous and the embankment construction became more difficult. This was the result of the negligence and delay of the Hebei provincial personnel in charge of river affairs.</p>
<p>The Closing of the Guantai Breach</p>
<p>Recognizing the perilous nature of the work and the difficulty of the embankment construction, and fearing that lack of unified authority would delay the important project, the committee, noting Director Kong Xiangrong's success in closing the Fenglou breach, reappointed him to take full responsibility for the Guantai remedial engineering project, following the Relief Work Group's method. An engineering office was established under the group, with Qi Chouan, Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, as the director. A telegram was sent to urgently convene the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, the Directors of Construction of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, and the Directors of River Affairs Bureaus to discuss remedial measures. It was decided to adopt the method of diverting the flow and using silt deposition to close the breach. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance was consulted to allocate funds to meet the urgent needs. Several Chinese and foreign experts were invited to conduct on-site inspections and study a plan to address both symptoms and root causes. After Director Kong took charge, he promptly deployed personnel, allocated tasks, transported willow and stone, and requisitioned boats and vehicles, working tirelessly from morning till night. On the material side, they were able to meet the needs of the project, and on the engineering side, they placed willow and stone mattresses on both the east and west dams, reinforcing them as breaches occurred, ensuring repeated safety. Willow dams were also built upstream and near the opening to divert the flow and promote silt deposition. Stone mattresses were laid inside the opening to protect the riverbed. When the two dams were adequately protected with stone mattresses, a date-kernel dam blocking method was implemented to close the breach. On the 11th of this month, it was reported that the Guantai breach was successfully closed at Chenshi (7-9 AM). It took Director Kong Xiangrong only twenty-odd days to take full responsibility for the Guantai project, working tirelessly and courageously to close the 29-meter deep water opening. This was to comfort the government's concern for the people's suffering and reflects the committee's best efforts at remediation and the successful closure.</p>
<p>A Plan to Address Both Symptoms and Root Causes</p>
<p>Based on the reports from the Chinese and foreign experts sent by the committee to inspect the work site, and after detailed study of the reports from various parties, it was generally believed that it was difficult to predict whether the project could be successfully closed. This is because the Yellow River's water flow is different from that of ordinary rivers. The problem is not only the excessive flow, but also the excessive sediment content, which causes deposition everywhere, resulting in constant shifts. The riverbed in the lower reaches has been rising over the years, making it difficult to discharge water smoothly, leading to more frequent breaches and making embankment construction more difficult. If reservoirs could be built in the mountain valleys upstream to store water, and new channels could be opened in the lowlands downstream, while reinforcing the Jin堤 (Jin Dike) and the dikes of the three provinces along the river for protection, the flood disaster might be slightly reduced. Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission member Li Yizhi was instructed to expedite the reinforcement of the Jin堤 before the flood season. Considering that the dikes of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces had been neglected and unrepaired for years, telegrams were sent to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the provincial governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, urging them to make early plans to repair and protect the dikes of the three provinces, discuss and implement them properly, and invite Chinese and foreign experts to conduct thorough research, so that the Yellow River disaster, which has historically been a major problem, could be reduced, and the tens of millions of acres of farmland along the river could be protected. This is the plan to address both the symptoms and root causes of the Yellow River flood disaster.</p>
<p>Total Cost of 450,000</p>
<p>Recently, a telegram was received from the supervisory committee members dispatched by President Yu of the Control Yuan, stating that the Guantai closure was progressing well and that continued efforts were needed to heighten and reinforce the embankment to achieve complete success. The swiftness of this closure was due to sufficient funding and unified authority, which enabled it to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Regarding the project funding, since Director Kong Xiangrong took over the remedial project, I, Xiangxi, allocated a total of 450,000 yuan. After the completion of the project, the director will be responsible for submitting the expense report to account for the public funds. All matters relating to the closure of the Yellow River Guantai breach and the various difficult circumstances are hereby reported for your consideration. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Chinese Art Association and Modern Chinese Art – A Speech by Zhang Daofan – <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Chinese Art Association, gave a radio speech on the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 14th, titled "The Chinese Art Association and Modern Chinese Art." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Many people know about the establishment of the Chinese Art Association in the capital, but I am afraid that many compatriots in more remote areas do not. Now, using this brief time, I will give everyone a simple report.</p>
<p>The Chinese Art Association was initiated by dozens of artists from Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and other places on the day of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday in 1933 and officially established in Nanjing. It has now been in existence for a year and a half. After its establishment, artists from various places enthusiastically joined the association, and it now has more than 200 members. On September 15, 1934, a founding anniversary exhibition was held in Nanjing, with many works submitted by artists from various places. It has been decided to hold spring and autumn exhibitions within this year. The spring exhibition is scheduled to open with a preview today (the 14th) and officially open tomorrow (the 15th). Now, I will briefly report on the preparation situation. The call for works for this exhibition was posted in February. The original deadline for submissions was the 5th of this month. Later, because the works sent by the post office from various provinces could not arrive on time due to the long distances, the deadline was extended to the 11th of this month. As a result, all the arrangement procedures were rushed to completion on the 12th and 13th, so it was extremely busy. Although there has been progress in the arrangement aspect compared to previous exhibitions, the colleagues of this association still feel that it is not satisfactory. I hope that all sectors will forgive us.</p>
<p>In total, more than 1,000 works of calligraphy, Chinese painting, oil painting, metalwork, sculpture, etc., were received. In terms of the location of submission, there were seventeen or eighteen provinces and cities including Henan, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hebei, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Guizhou. In terms of the artists, there were more than two hundred people including Chen Shuren, Gao Jianfu, Xu Beihong, Wang Qi, Ru Yuli, Li Yigong, Zhu Wenyun, Chen Zhifo, Hong Ludong, Zhang Shuqi, Liu Xiaoseng, Wang Dong, Zhang Xiaolou, Xie Gongzhan, Zhao Shaoang, Wang Yachen, Zhang Guang, Yu Jifan, Xu Shiqi, Pan Yuliang, Gao Leyi, Long Wen, Gao Xishun, Zhang Yiran, Li Jinfa, Zhou Bomin, Pan Tianshou, Sun Fuxi, Chen Liaoqing, Pan Boshan, Guan Yide, Yang Shoutao, Liu Zigu, Huang Shaoqiang, Huang Shaoshou, Jiang Danqing, Zhou Zhensun, Yang Manhua, Xiao Qianzhong, Tian Huan, Wu Fuzhi, Zhu Qizhan, Lu Shihou, Liang Dingming, Yang Jihong, Zhang Yu, Wang Chengzai, Wang Chengzhai, Teng Baibei, Huang Hongtu, Jiang Zhaohe, and Wang Linyi. This enthusiastic participation of artists from various places is really a good phenomenon. However, what this association regrets the most is that the venue of the Bamboo Capital Overseas Chinese Reception Center is too small to display all the works. Therefore, as a result of the selection, only about 360 pieces can be displayed. I cannot bear to part with the rest of the works. Regarding this matter, I would like to make a solemn statement now, which is that the works that cannot be displayed cannot be said to be all unqualified or unsuccessful. The limited venue size is one reason. Late arrival of submissions is another reason. Oversized, too long, or too small submissions that are inconvenient to hang or display are another reason. Lack of frames or improper mounting is another reason. Everyone knows this situation, and both the submitters and the audience will probably forgive this association.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the development of art is closely related to the culture of a country. In the past hundred years or so, Chinese art seems to have been declining day by day. Its important position in world culture has almost been shaken. This gives a major warning to us who are now paying attention to culture, loving art, and working hard in art. The reason for this is nothing more than the fact that in the past, artists generally lacked a good organization to cooperate with, and the government or society failed to fully promote or support it. The establishment of this association is to make up for the lack of organization in the past. The enthusiastic participation of artists from various places after the establishment of this association proves that cooperation is not impossible. In terms of the central and local governments, in addition to having decided to build a Central Museum in Nanjing, it has also recently decided to build an art exhibition hall in the capital. This is proof of the country's emphasis on promoting and supporting art. In terms of society, there has also been a lot of enthusiasm for promotion and support in recent years.</p>
<p>All of this is very gratifying for the future of Chinese art. What this association most sincerely hopes for now is: (1) That artists all over the country work together with sincerity and cooperation; (2) That the central or local governments promote and support art as much as possible; (3) That social figures and art lovers pay special attention to and support art, so that the works of Chinese artists will have considerable outlets in the future, maintain a minimum standard of living, and increase the courage of all artists to work hard, so that Chinese art can achieve great achievements in the 20th century and stabilize the important position of Chinese art in world culture. The colleagues of this association are willing to dedicate their loyalty and do their utmost to cooperate sincerely and move forward with the artists of the whole country under the promotion of the central government and the support of social figures."</p>

<p>Li Zufu, the chief of the first district of this county, recently petitioned the county government again, requesting to resign due to the concurrent handling of baojia (household registration system) and river dredging, and the recurrence of an old illness, making it difficult to manage both. The county government instructed in a document stating, "The report is noted. It is claimed that the old illness has recurred and it is difficult to manage both baojia and river dredging. The resignation is approved. Awaiting selection of a replacement. Before the selection and appointment, Assistant Lu Jingzi of the district will temporarily act as the district chief. In addition to separate orders, you must immediately comply." It is heard that Acting District Chief Lu will immediately report on the baojia and urge the river dredging after Li completes the handover.</p>

<p>Over the years, the provincial government has borrowed grain in the amount of 80,000 yuan from landowners in Wuxian for the land tax (calculated at 4.5 yuan per stone, approximately 0.45 yuan per mu). Although the landowners have repeatedly petitioned the provincial government to request its return, and the provincial government has considered repaying it in five years, it has not been repaid due to the tight provincial treasury. Recently, the Suzhou Finance Bureau has been rigorously pursuing outstanding taxes. Therefore, the landowners have requested the provincial government to offset the outstanding taxes with the borrowed grain. Because the procedures were not in order, the provincial government instructed them to supplement the procedures and then conduct a further review. Recently, local gentry Peng Zijia and others submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday (the 18th), fully explaining the situation of the borrowed grain and requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be ordered to return the borrowed grain in full to alleviate the suffering of the people of Suzhou.</p>

<p>This year's spring silkworm eggs, as stipulated by the Provincial Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee, are allowed to be freely traded by various farms, with a uniform selling price of 4 jiao (1 jiao is 1/10 of a yuan) per sheet of eggs. No underpricing or price gouging is allowed, otherwise, severe punishment will be imposed. However, since the start of sales, many eggs have been shipped to neighboring counties in other provinces, resulting in a situation where the supply of spring silkworm eggs in this county cannot meet the demand. In recent days, farmers in the rural areas have been very enthusiastic about buying eggs. Therefore, those who seek profit have privately raised prices, selling five sheets for 5 jiao, 5 jiao and 5 fen, or even 7 or 8 jiao. The Sericulture Model Zone has reported the above situation, and in addition to ordering immediate reporting for strict investigation and handling according to the law, it has also dispatched personnel to the rural areas to investigate and gather evidence.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng departed from the West Railway Station around 8:00 AM yesterday morning on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train for Hangzhou. According to those close to Wu, the Mayor's trip to Hangzhou is due to recent overwork and mental fatigue from intensive discussions and preparations for various important municipal policies. He is taking a short break for relaxation and has no official business to attend to. He will return to Shanghai to resume his duties in three or four days.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Minister Kong Arrives in Shanghai and Discusses: No Need to Panic About Silver Issues; No Need to Increase Balancing Tax Currently; Relief for Yellow River Disaster Area Under Investigation <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, who recently went to Nanjing to attend meetings of the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Council, left Nanjing by overnight train at 11:00 PM the night before and arrived at Zhenru Station at 7:10 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on Seymour Road for rest. Later, around 11:00 AM, he met with reporters and made remarks on the silver issue. At noon, he went to the Central Bank to handle important official matters. The following is a record of Minister Kong's remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Balancing Tax Rate: No Increase for Now <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to Minister Kong, there is currently no need to increase the silver export balancing tax. Since the United States raised the price of silver, the detriment to us has been the sharp outflow of silver. Currently, foreign banks in Shanghai have shown good intentions and are voluntarily no longer exporting silver. There is no need to panic about the silver issue. The government's levying of a silver export balancing tax is also aimed at stopping the export of silver. Now that foreign banks are voluntarily no longer exporting silver, there is no need to increase the balancing tax for the time being.</p>

<p>The military operations to suppress bandits in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces have been progressing smoothly recently. The temporary expenditures for bandit suppression are also quite limited. The confluence of the Yellow River's Guantai breach has been completed. The staff has worked hard.

<p>Central Committee Member Zhang Jingjiang recently went to Sichuan on official business. Having completed his tasks, he took the Minsheng Company's Minzu steamer eastward on the 9th of this month. After delays along the way, he arrived in Shanghai at 11:50 AM yesterday. More than a dozen people, including Central Committee Member Li Shizeng and Construction Committee Member Cheng Shifan, went to the dock to welcome him. After the ship docked, Li and others boarded the ship to welcome him. Zhang met with the press in turn and gave a speech.

<p>The new giant Douglas trimotor aircraft purchased by China National Aviation Corporation was transported to Shanghai last month and has undergone repeated test flights with satisfactory results. Starting at 10:00 AM yesterday, the company specially invited representatives from the Chinese and foreign press and various circles to ride the aircraft, with three flights, each lasting about 20 minutes, flying around the city. The company's General Manager, Dai Enji, personally hosted the event. The aircraft's equipment is more complete than the giant Ford aircraft. There are 14 passenger seats inside, and the head can accommodate one pilot and three radio operators. The seats are exceptionally spacious, and the soundproofing is excellent. There is no jarring noise of the engine during flight, and soft conversations can be held. The test rides were praised by all sectors. The aircraft was personally piloted by American pilot Mr. White, who came to Shanghai with the aircraft, so the flight felt particularly smooth. It is reported that the aircraft is scheduled to formally join the Shanghai-Peiping route within days and will carry passengers.</p>

<h3 id="e123">20 Million Relief Loans to Industry and Commerce: Decision to Implement Before the End of This Month; So That All Industries Can Obtain Funds to Cope With Year-End Settlement; Central, China, and Communications Banks Preside Over Preliminary Detailed Measures; Bankers Association to Convene Executive Committee Meeting for Discussion <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, as well as the Bankers Association of Shanghai, received instructions from the Ministry of Finance the night before, as well as ten principles for relief loans to industry and commerce. The Bankers Association has already coordinated with Standing Committee Members Ye Fuxiao, Bei Songsun, Tang Shoumin, and the Central, China, and Communications Banks to proceed. Since Bei and Tang are officials of the Central and Communications Banks, the negotiation is quite convenient. The association has now decided to wait for the three banks to negotiate and formulate a concrete plan before convening an executive committee meeting to discuss the implementation. The association's planned small credit loan of 1,885,000 yuan, which is to be recognized by various banks, has now been decided to be temporarily suspended and will be incorporated into the credit guarantee loan in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Three Banks Discuss Measures <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>A Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the relief loans to industry and commerce will be presided over by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Detailed measures will be formulated first, and then the Bankers Association will be jointly handled. It is understood that the three banks have begun consultations and discussions yesterday. As for the loan measures, whether the three banks will jointly form a committee similar to a banking syndicate with various banks, or follow the method of interbank lending before the year-end closing of accounts last year, or whether each bank will undertake borrowing within the specified loan amount, all need to wait for the three banks to formulate measures and negotiate with the Bankers Association to make a final decision.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Implementation Before the End of the Month <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to sources from the three banks, the implementation period of the 20 million yuan loan has been decided to start before the end of this month. The long-term loans borrowed by factories and shops in Shanghai from the Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) will all expire at the end of this month. Although the Qianzhuang Association has notified the Qianzhuang to be flexible within the possible range, it seems that the Qianzhuang cannot completely renew the loans due to their own circumstances. Therefore, all industries and businesses are hoping that the 20 million yuan loan will be implemented before the end of the month, so that industry and commerce can obtain funds, circulate turnover, and maintain the market.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Finance has long instructed the Bank of Communications to increase official shares by 10 million yuan and revised the original regulations. After receiving the order, the bank has scheduled to convene a standing committee meeting of the board of directors and a general meeting of shareholders today and tomorrow to discuss. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e131">Revised Regulations <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The original capital stock of the Bank of Communications was 10 million yuan, of which 2 million yuan was official shares and the rest was commercial shares. The Ministry of Finance believes that the social finance has been exhausted in recent years and the market turnover is difficult, and banks urgently need to invest huge amounts to adjust. However, the bank's funds are limited and it is feared that it will be difficult to cope with the situation. Therefore, it has been decided to invest 10 million yuan in official shares, which will be allocated from the 24th year of the Republic of China's financial bonds. An order has been received and the principles of the regulations have been revised.</p>

<p>After receiving the order, the bank has scheduled to convene a standing committee meeting of the board of directors at 2:00 PM today in the bank's conference room to discuss seven matters. It is heard that the revised regulations are the same as those of the Bank of China. The original fixed interest rate for both official and commercial shares was 7%, but now, in order to give preferential treatment to commercial shares, the annual interest rate for other shares has been reduced to 5%. The directors to be added after the increase in official shares will be announced today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>The general meeting of shareholders is scheduled to be held tomorrow (the 20th) in the afternoon. The board of directors will report the Ministry's order to increase capital stock and submit the revised regulations for discussion. Since the term of office of the original directors of the bank has not yet expired, there will be no changes except for the directors appointed by the Ministry. However, the supervisors have completed their term of office, so they will be re-elected.</p>

The second section described the differences between Chinese and European art, saying that Chinese painting deeply captures the interest of nature and is different from European painting, which focuses on artificiality. It also said that the invention of Chinese porcelain was 1,000 years earlier than that of Europe and was an important invention. The third section described the importance of the exhibition, briefly stating that the London exhibition has great significance internationally, which can make Chinese and European cultures communicate and make Europe more fully understand China. The fourth section described that the exhibits are sufficient to represent Chinese art, and are very different from the antiques previously sold by antique dealers into Europe, which only dazzled Europeans with novelty.

<h3 id="e150">Chamber of Commerce Calls on the Legislative Yuan: To Pass the Commercial Registration Law Quickly; To Remedy Article 681 of the Civil Code <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Legislative Yuan yesterday, saying, "We have just approved the Han口 Chamber of Commerce's telegraph stating that the provisions of Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code, which stipulates that partners are jointly and severally liable for partnership debts, are difficult to implement. We request that the Commercial Registration Law be revised to remedy this situation. The drafting has been jointly carried out by the Civil Code and Commercial Law Committees. Article 9 of the draft stipulates that the names, addresses, and types and amounts of investment of the partners, if they have been registered with the competent authority in the place of business by each person, shall be liable for sharing losses within the limits of their investment. The same applies when shares are transferred or changed. This provision is most in line with the requirements of businessmen. At the meeting and review on October 31 of last year, there were still strong objections, resulting in no decision being made. The Chamber believes that this case is of great importance to the future of commerce and has passed the original text of Article 9 of the draft law on November 15 of the same year to remedy the situation. It has been approved for reference by the Civil Code and Commercial Law Committees. Several months have passed without hearing any further discussion. If this is shelved for a long time, the disputes caused by Article 681 of the Civil Code to businessmen will not be resolved. At a time when commerce is declining and finance is bankrupt, the number of partnership stores is bound to decrease day by day, and the organization of the old commercial arena is really at risk of shaking its foundations. The Chamber represents all the merchants in Shanghai and regards this as a matter of vital interest. We are therefore telegraphing your hospital for verification. We implore you to convene a meeting for discussion as soon as possible and pass the original proposal to facilitate commercial transportation. We pray for this. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, bows respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Reply From the Ministry of Judicial Administration: Whether the Bond Provides a Guarantee Should Still Be Decided by the Court <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter from the Timber Industry Association, requesting that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice be forwarded to notify all courts that when litigants provide public bonds as collateral, they should not refuse them. The Chamber has now received a reply from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating: "The presentation has been acknowledged. Public bonds are one of the valuable securities. According to the provisions of Article 75, Paragraph 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, they should be allowed to be substituted for bail. However, they must be converted at the market price. This was instructed by the Judicial Yuan's Yuanzi No. 430 on February 5, 20th year to the Zhejiang High Court on record. The nature of treasury bills is the same as that of public bonds, and civil security deposits are similar to criminal bail. If litigants provide public bonds and treasury bills as civil security or pay criminal bail, and they are converted at the market price, the courts will naturally find it difficult not to accept them. However, Section 2 of Article 102 of the Code of Civil Procedure states that those who provide security shall deposit cash or valuable securities deemed appropriate by the court. Also, Section 2 of Article 75 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that bail may be substituted with valuable securities depending on the circumstances. Therefore, whether or not to allow it should still be decided by the court. The above-mentioned sections have been ordered to the Jiangsu High Court and the two High Courts, Second and Third Divisions, to submit their opinions and report them, and the Ministry of Finance has also been approved to send a letter to the Ministry to discuss the situation.

<p>The Student National Products Year Promotion Joint Association held a citywide student "Use National Products" oath ceremony at the City Hall yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, and exhibited domestically produced student supplies. The enthusiasm of the participating schools and the excitement of the student representatives were unprecedented. The details of the event are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The layout of the association's auditorium was extremely magnificent and solemn, surrounded by flowers and trees. At the same time, the Public Works Bureau and the Asia American Company installed loudspeakers, so all students in the venue could clearly hear the instructions from the mayor and representatives from various agencies and industries. The sound was very clear. The layout of the exhibition was overseen by Cao Zhigong of the association's factory group, together with artists Fang Xuegu and Liao Yiwen. The review of the exhibits was extremely strict, adhering to the principle of "rather have fewer but better items," but the variety was still very complete, gathering the exquisite products from various national product factories in one place, creating a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>Conference Staff</p>
<p>The presidium of the conference included Mayor Wu, Director Pan, Director Wu, Tong Xingbai, Yu Zuoting, Zhang Shouyong, and Huang Zaoxiong. The general commander was Li Dachao, the deputy general commander was Tao Guangchuan, the commander was Yang Weiyu, and the master of ceremonies was Xu Yefu.

<p>Aerial Propaganda</p>
<p>In order to expand publicity, the association not only arranged for various newspapers to publish special issues yesterday and invited Chen Dabeito host and Su Changjun to entertain at the Shanghai Radio Station, broadcasting various valuable, meaningful, and inspiring programs to promote the concept of using national products to the audience all day, but also invited the Eurasia Aviation Company to send airplanes to circle the city and distribute various promotional materials for the Student National Products Year printed and donated by the Commercial Press. As a result, paper butterflies were flying in the sky for a time, creating a spectacular sight. Citizens scrambled to get them, and cheers resounded, creating a magnificent moment.</p>
<p>Venue Order</p>
<p>The association invited the Boy Scout Council to send 500 boy scouts to various parts of the venue to maintain order. Schools arriving at the venue were given numbered flags and led by the boy scouts to line up in rows. The order was well-organized, which was rare in all gatherings.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony was performed as required, the chairman of the presidium, Pan Gongzhan, gave a report, saying, "Dear students, today is the day when the Student National Products Year Promotion Joint Association convenes representatives from large, medium, and small schools across the city to hold the "Use National Products" oath ceremony at the City Hall. This year, representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai have designated this year as the Student National Products Year because they feel that the national economic situation is declining year by year, with a staggering annual trade deficit of 700 million yuan. On average, every citizen buys two yuan worth of foreign goods. If we do not wake up again, we will perish without waiting for the military and political aggression of the great powers. Therefore, all parties have taken the initiative to promote national products, hoping that factories will improve their products, businesses will sell fewer foreign goods, and students, as outstanding members of society, with pure knowledge, will engage in promoting national products, so that people will have some understanding of national products. However, the Student National Products Year is not only for students to use national products, but also for non-students to bear the same responsibility. Students themselves should start with themselves in persuading people. In the early stages of our work, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort, we are holding this solemn and grand "Use National Products" oath ceremony here to give students a deep impression and encourage themselves. At the same time, we hope that after participating in the oath, students will earnestly persuade their families, schools, and society according to the oath."</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Tong Xingbai gave a speech, saying, "Representatives from all walks of life, dear students, we have heard the call to promote national products for a long time. However, the result is still nothing more than a five-minute burst of enthusiasm, forgotten after the expiration date, and all previous efforts are abandoned, which is a pity. The Student National Products Year, seeing the indifference of the people of the country to the psychology of national products, has specially convened students to hold an oath ceremony here. Representatives from all over the city enthusiastically participate, and the future hope for promoting national products is limitless. The purpose of the oath is to remedy the shortcomings of the five-minute enthusiasm. It cannot be taken lightly. It is closely related to personal character and integrity. If you still use foreign goods after taking the oath, although no one is watching, our character has been severely damaged. We have sworn publicly and violated the oath, which means we have no integrity. From now on, we should earnestly publicize and promote to families, relatives, friends, and society, and take the initiative to use national products in order to achieve the purpose of the oath. Our country is now in a state of economic panic, industrial depression, and worker unemployment, which has reached an extreme state of decline. The reason is that foreign goods are dumping, so that workers cannot survive, indirectly creating social unrest. If you want to remedy the current crisis, you can only seek development from the economy. The people of the country should happily use national products, so that domestic industries can prosper, and then the country can be restored. On the contrary, if foreign goods are rampant, how can workers live? Today's student oath is of great importance to the future of the country. Saving the country and saving the people is all in this one action. May you all practice it in person to achieve the goal, so that the country and society can be restored."</p>

<p>Shao Xubai's Speech</p>
<p>Shao Xubai, a representative of the General Labor Union, gave a speech, saying, "Today, I am here to participate in the Student National Products Year Promotion Joint Association. It is very gratifying that students from all over the city are taking an oath to use national products with such a good spirit. In the past, the voices of promoting national products have been enthusiastically shouted for several years, and the results have not satisfied all parties. Last year was the Women's National Products Year, and the imports of rouge, powder, perfume, etc. seen in the newspapers were all increasing. The facts tell us that customs imports are increasing. Is this the performance that should be had in the National Products Year? But this year, all sectors have publicly designated this year as the Student National Products Year. Please don't be discouraged and continue to work hard to promote it. Especially in the field of education, it is the vanguard of the nation. The school authorities use national products, and then the teachers and students promote them to the family, and then further promote them to all aspects. Now the country, in addition to expanding military preparations with political force, the most important thing is the economy. Therefore, all countries, in addition to expanding military preparations, pay great attention to the economy. The United States is raising the price of silver and inflating the currency to export goods as much as possible, which is also a matter of paying attention to economic problems. China is the number one consumer market in the eyes of all countries, but if you want to avoid this kind of economic aggression, you can only save yourself. The way to save yourself is to unite the whole country to promote national products. The rejuvenation of China is just around the corner. I hope everyone who takes the oath will keep it in mind and don't throw it out of the blue after it's over. This is the original intention of the speech. I hope you will all encourage each other." In addition, Zhang Shouyong, Lu Xingzhuang, and others also gave speeches, and the length of the speeches is omitted.</p>
<p>Student's Reply</p>
<p>After the representatives finished their speeches, Jiang Nianqu of Datong University gave a reply, saying, "Today I am here to participate in the oath ceremony of the Student National Products Year Promotion Joint Association, and after hearing the instructions from all the gentlemen, I can't help but have many thoughts. Recalling the past, we cannot separate ourselves from foreign goods in our lives, from morning to night, resulting in a staggering annual trade deficit and being subjected to economic aggression by the great powers, causing the national vitality to decline day by day. If we do not immediately rise up and save ourselves, what can we imagine for the future of the country? Today, the Student National Products Year is holding an oath here. All of us students should actively promote national products from today onwards, so that the family and society will be completely nationalized. If this can be done, the country will have hope." Then, Yin Baotai of Jiaotong University gave a speech, saying, "In the past few years, the result of promoting national products is that the annual trade deficit has gradually increased. This cannot but be attributed to the ineffectiveness of the promoters and the lack of self-love of the general public. It must be known that promoting national products is not only about holding meetings, shouting slogans, and posting slogans. The promoters must first set an example, practice it in person, and promote it earnestly without avoiding slander. It is important to know that people slander me, and their intention is to encourage us to continue to work hard, not to destroy us. However, failure is the mother of success. We should follow the Premier's revolutionary spirit, continue our efforts, and never give up. I firmly believe that it will be effective. Today, we take an oath here, and we should work hard according to the words of the oath. It must be known that promoting national products is the only way to save the country and save the people." Then, Yang Lizhen of Minli Women's Middle School replied, saying, "Today is the student oath ceremony. All students should devote themselves to the promotion of national products from today onwards, so as not to betray the original intention of the oath." Finally, Chen Yaru, a representative of Tiehua Elementary School, gave a speech, saying, "Since our country has been in contact with the great powers, the number of imported goods has been increasing year by year. The reason is that the people of the country like novelty and love modernity, which has led to the decline of national power day by day. If this continues, the country will be destroyed. This year is the Student National Products Year, and students should take action to achieve practical results, earnestly promote it, and complete their mission. National economy and people's livelihood rely on it."</p>
<p>Visit the Exhibition</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the students lined up according to the flag number and entered the City Hall auditorium to visit the National Products Student Supplies Exhibition. The layout of the venue was magnificent, and all the exhibits were set up in the air without using nails, so the students of each school could have a deep impression of the exhibits. After the visit, they came out one by one, so there was no phenomenon of rushing to get the gifts at the exit, which was enough to show the spirit of the new life.</p>
<p>Grand Event at the Venue</p>
<p>The Student National Products Use Oath Ceremony held by the association was attended by more than 10,000 students from more than 600 schools. According to the person in charge of the association, all parties cooperated very well in this gathering. For example, the Zhabei Bus Company had a joint reception office at the North Station and Tiantong'an Station, which provided low prices and order, and helped the teachers and students attending the meeting a lot. The Public Works Bureau and the Asia American Company installed loudspeakers, so it was clear even dozens of feet away, so there was no need to worry about the crowd. The Public Security Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Municipal Government Boy Scout Council, etc. gave a lot of help. The full band of the Public Security Bureau trained the students to sing the National Products Year song in advance and played at the meeting, which was especially commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Ministry of Industry to Enforce Membership Regulations for Fellow Traders; Since Fellow Traders Have No Freedom to Withdraw or Not Join, This Interpretation Should Be Included in the Implementation Rules <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Regarding the request for confirmation, on October 6 of last year, your ministry issued instruction No. 29209 regarding the association's request to confirm the sanctions for fellow traders who do not join the guild. The instruction stated: 'Both requests are noted. Regarding the case of fellow traders not joining the guild, we have recently received a letter from the Central People's Movement Committee and a consultation from the Hubei Provincial Government, forwarded by the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting a clear definition of measures to compel fellow traders to join the guild uniformly and to hold non-member businesses jointly responsible for all obligations of members. According to the legal intent of Articles 3, Section 2, 4, Section 1, and 7 of the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law, the members of the trade guild are the local companies and firms in the entire industry. All those who belong to the same industry should naturally join the guild, should fulfill the obligations of members, and should abide by the rules of the guild. Moreover, except for suspension of business, relocation, or expulsion, there is no freedom to withdraw or not join. The term "join the guild" in Article 4, Item 5, refers to the regulations for joining procedures. If a business is negligent in fulfilling these joining procedures, it still cannot be exempted from its obligations. The section of the association's proposal that non-member businesses should be held jointly responsible for all obligations of members is in accordance with the regulations. As for the main obligation of members, which is paying membership fees, for those who do not fulfill this obligation, the Interpretation No. 914 of the Judicial Yuan from May of last year can be used to file a lawsuit for payment according to law.' The above situation was submitted and instructed to be informed on file. According to the previous submission, it is urgent to instruct and inform on file." The association fully admires the ministry's intention to remedy the situation in a timely manner and weigh the situation fairly. The association has repeatedly engaged experts and committees to discuss the implementation plan, who all believe that the above instruction from the ministry is an elaboration on the legal intent of the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law, aiming to facilitate implementation and originally containing the nature of implementation rules. The above instruction, rather than being filed away, should be made into a provision, which is easier for the guild to comply with and easier for the court to adopt. It is proposed to add a new article after Article 9 of the current Implementation Rules of the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law, stating: 'Local companies and firms, except those who should be expelled according to the guild's rules and those who are rejected for membership, are all members of the trade guild, but must fulfill the joining procedures. Those who do not fulfill the joining procedures established by the guild shall fulfill the obligations of members and shall not be exempted under any pretext, and the guild may sue the government to urge them to fulfill the obligations, and may also suspend their rights and give them appropriate sanctions according to the rules.' With this provision, those who have not fulfilled the joining procedures and owe membership fees and violate industry regulations can be reported to the government with a basis for acceptance. This is what is proposed for your ministry to adopt and implement." "In addition, according to the above instruction from your ministry, all businesses that are negligent in fulfilling joining procedures and negligent in fulfilling membership obligations are in violation of the guild's rules. In addition to expulsion, the guild should specify other methods of punishment in the guild's rules. Therefore, in the future, to sanction members who violate these guild rules, each trade guild should urgently supplement specific articles in the current rules for compliance. It is proposed that after approval from your ministry, the municipal guilds will be notified to supplement two articles in the current rules: 'One is that all companies, firms, and stores in the city's area that are in the same industry, except those expelled by the guild's rules and those rejected for membership, are members of the guild, should abide by the guild's rules and industry regulations approved by the competent government, and should obey the guild's discipline and fulfill the guild's resolutions, but can only enjoy the rights of members after completing the following joining procedures.' The joining procedures are listed on the left: 'A. Introduction by two or more members of the guild, approved by a majority of the executive committee. B. Filling out a membership application form. C. Paying the membership fee.' 'The second is that all members who have the obligation to comply with the provisions of the guild's rules shall have the method of punishment decided by the executive committee according to the circumstances, as follows: 1. Warning. 2. Suspension of the rights granted by the guild's laws and regulations and other protections that the guild should have for the industry. 3. Reputational sanctions. 4. Monetary sanctions. 5. Expulsion. 6. All members break off relations with them.' The amount of item 4 above shall be decided by the executive committee and submitted to the competent government for approval and execution. Since this matter concerns a common case and is based on instruction No. 29209 from your ministry, we should request that the principles be approved first, so that each industry can draft articles accordingly, which will be more serious. At that time, it should be passed by the general assembly of each guild and submitted to the competent government for approval and implementation to comply with the procedures." "The above two requests are all elaborations and references to the instructions of your ministry, seeking to make the provisions more detailed. Experts have no objection, and it is also convenient for the business situation. We should prepare a document and submit it to your ministry for review and approval and implementation, which is convenient for the public. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<h3 id="e155">The First Special Court Prepares to Build a New Prison; Land Has Been Purchased on Qipei Road; A Committee Has Been Formed to Oversee Construction <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Women's Prison in the First Special District was originally reorganized from the Women's Detention Center in the era of the Mixed Court. The prison site is located in a corner of the First Special District Local Court of Gao Erfen. Although the prison is five stories high, the number of female criminals has been increasing in recent years. The female prisoners in the prison are full and cannot be accommodated. The local authorities have long planned to build a large new prison. In the past, they asked the local authorities to purchase land in the west of Shanghai to prepare for construction. However, due to some kind of problem, the plan could not be realized. They then rented several folk houses near Yuqing Lane on Shangpu Road as temporary prisons, specializing in imprisoning female criminals serving short sentences and detention, such as prostitutes and opium smokers, who were all transferred to them. The original prison was relieved of the burden of overcrowding. However, this is not a long-term solution. Therefore, the authorities of the two courts still believe that the construction of a prison is a matter that cannot be delayed. Last month, they surveyed a piece of land located on Qipei Road, opposite the Gao Erfen Court, which is very suitable for building a prison. They negotiated with the owner, Yi Shang, and it is said that they have already purchased it. The authorities of the two courts then appointed senior personnel with architectural knowledge and organized the "Special District New Prison Construction Committee Office" yesterday in the downstairs room of the Gao Erfen Court to be responsible for preparing for the construction of the prison. The staff of the association were very busy at the beginning of its establishment.</p>
<h3 id="e156">The Case of Red Breeze Drugged with Keerfang Elixir Continues; The Family Has Concluded the Interrogation and Set a Date for Sentencing <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The case of Wang Yuxian, known as Red Breeze and Old Nine, being drugged with Keerfang elixir and robbed of a gold bracelet and jade ring worth sixty yuan in room 523 of the Yangzi Hotel at 289 Yunnan Road was investigated by Chinese detective Yang Peisheng and detective eye Ruan Taibin of the Yulin Road Police Station, who arrested four suspects, the young men Ruan Zilin, Lu Jianying, Li Jianguang, and doctor Liu Jiaji, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent Ruan and others to the third criminal court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Engineering Bureau explained the process and said that when Ruan Zilin was arrested, he had two pawn tickets and a pistol hidden in a water tank at 280 Beijing Road. The detectives went and took them out, but there were no bullets. It was said that they belonged to a friend surnamed Xu. The pawn tickets were also his. The surname Xu was arrested by the local court for a robbery case and is currently being interrogated. Detectives have been sent to inquire and said that it has nothing to do with the crime committed by Ruan. It has now been found out that Doctor Liu Jiaji was actually framed by Ruan. The Keerfang elixir was borrowed from Guo Jingqing in Jiangwan. Now Guo has come to court to testify, so Doctor Liu should be declared innocent. The other three defendants are charged with robbery by three or more people in accordance with Article 348 of the Criminal Law and drug anesthesia crimes in accordance with Article 346. Please investigate. According to Guo Jingqing's statement, he lives at 11 Songjia Port, Jiangwan. He used to be a nurse and doctor in a hospital, but now he has resigned and practices medicine at home. The Keerfang elixir was because Ruan had neck problems, and I treated him. He knew the nature of the elixir. On the 6th of this month, he went to Xin Xin Hotel to open a room and borrowed the elixir. I thought it was too dangerous, so I asked for it back. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 8th, while I was out, he went home with two friends, Lu and Li, and secretly took a bottle of the elixir to do this illegal thing. I did not hear about it in advance. Questioning Ruan Zilin, he confessed that the Xin Xin Hotel was where Guo wanted to use the elixir to drug prostitutes, but the prostitute who was called was a substitute and could not start. Later, he changed to the Yangzi Hotel, but it was the same. This was the second time that I, Lu, and Li did this illegal thing, but the elixir was still given by Guo. The accusations against Doctor Liu are really false. The rest of the confession was evasive, and Lu Jianying confessed that he was completely harmed by Ruan. He hired two lawyers, Yan Fanggang and Jiang Baoli, to defend him, asking for a lenient sentence so that he could change his ways and start a new life. Li Jianguang confessed that he was also forced by Ruan. Liu Jiaji confessed that he knew nothing about the case. Ruan Zilin has not been to my place for a long time. Please take note. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered Liu Jiaji to be released on bail, and the rest were returned to prison. The judgment will be announced on the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Shi Jiurong Nearly Abducted by Bandits - Four Bandits Boarded the Vehicle but Could Not Start It Due to a Secret Switch - A Russian Yelled "Robbers!" and Chinese Police Pursued and Killed One Bandit - Shi Jiurong Has No Assets or Savings <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around nine o'clock, at the corner of Avenue Dubail and Avenue du Maréchal Joffre in the French Concession, in front of the American-owned Meitong Automobile Company, the most renowned dealer of Ford and other automobiles in Shanghai, an attempted kidnapping occurred. The intended victim was Shi Jiurong, a mechanic at Meitong. Fortunately, the alertness of his chauffeur, surnamed Rou, and a foreign coppersmith, who shouted for the police, led to the pursuit of the four bandits. One bandit was shot dead on the spot by the police, and the other three escaped. The intended victim managed to escape unharmed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Family Background and Occupation</p>
<p>Shi Jiurong, a native of Ningbo, is 32 years old. He graduated from St. John's University in Shanghai and studied in the United States, earning a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan. After returning to China, he worked at Xintong Automobile Company on Avenue d'Albert. This year, he transferred from Xintong to Meitong. Shi's family lives at 275 Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai and owns a coffee-colored Buick sedan with license plate number 976 in the International Settlement for transportation, employing a chauffeur named Li Alin.</p>
<p>Bandits Board the Car</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after getting up and washing and eating, it was already nine o'clock. Shi, considering it was time for work, ordered Li Alin to drive the car out. Shi got into the car, heading straight for the company. However, as soon as the car arrived at the company entrance and the chauffeur stopped the car, Shi was about to reach for the door handle when four bandits suddenly jumped onto the car from behind. Two were dressed in short blue outfits, and two wore long blue robes. Three bandits forced their way into Shi's car compartment, sitting on either side of him and brandishing guns to restrain him.</p>
<p>Unable to Start the Car</p>
<p>The other bandit sat in the front compartment with the chauffeur, Li Alin. He slapped Li twice in the face, ordering him to give up his seat. The bandit then attempted to drive the car himself. However, Li, sensing the danger, had secretly switched off the "hidden starter" beforehand. As a result, when the bandit tried to start the car, the engine could not be started. While the bandits were fumbling in confusion, the doorman-policeman at the company entrance saw Shi's car arrive and calmly approached to open the car door, unaware that there were four bandits inside.</p>
<p>Russian Shouts</p>
<p>But at that moment, when the bandits saw the doorman-policeman approaching, they suspected he was there to arrest them. One of the bandits drew a gun and fired at the policeman, hitting him in the left shin. The gunshot alarmed a Russian coppersmith, Folaike, who was standing nearby. Seeing what was happening, he shouted "Catch the robbers!" in Chinese. The bandits still hoped to succeed and ordered Li Alin to drive quickly, but Li pretended to be unable to. At this point, the bandits realized the situation was hopeless, jumped out of the car, and fled in different directions.</p>
<p>Chinese Police Pursuit</p>
<p>Two bandits fled from Avenue du Maréchal Joffre towards Avenue Joffre, while the other two escaped from Avenue Dubail towards Avenue d'Albert. However, Folaike refused to give up easily and continued to chase and shout. One bandit, in desperation, turned around and fired two shots, but fortunately, both missed. At that moment, a Chinese policeman number 282 from the Public Concession was passing by on a motorcycle. Hearing the shots, he rushed to the scene and joined the pursuit.</p>
<p>One Bandit Killed</p>
<p>The police chased the bandits to the vicinity of Seymour Road and Avenue d'Albert. They saw a bandit running ahead and opened fire. At the same time, Chinese policeman number 349 from the French Concession police also joined in the pursuit. As a result, one bandit was hit by two bullets in the back, which exited through his chest, killing him instantly. The bandit was wearing a long blue robe with a short cotton-padded jacket and black cloth trousers. He was still clutching a handgun tightly in his hand. A large number of detectives from the French Concession police arrived and transported the dead bandit to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await examination by the Second Special District Court. Meanwhile, they are investigating to bring his accomplices to justice.</p>
<p>No Assets</p>
<p>According to reporters, Mr. Shi's job at Meitong is mainly to solicit business, in addition to being an engineer. He has no assets or savings. He is usually kind and sincere in his dealings with people and has no enemies. The cause of this incident is probably due to a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Case of Cai Yangqi is Heard Again Yesterday - Lang Zuyin Still Absent <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Bao Detective Lang Zuyin of the Old Zha Criminal Police Station was sued last summer by Cai Fan, the wife of Cai Yangqi, for injuring her husband. Lang has consistently failed to appear in court. Despite appeals, the issue has not been resolved for nearly a year. As a result, the First Special District Court, which is handling the case, has repeatedly set hearing dates, but it has been impossible to conduct the trial.

<p>Around nine o'clock the night before last, the home of Bian Huairen, a native of Yangzhou, at 31 Xinjia Road in Zhabei, was broken into by thieves, who robbed him of gold and silver ornaments worth hundreds of dollars and fled. They escaped into the Jingwei Li neighborhood at 362 Wuzhou Road in the concession. Chinese officers Gao Chuanyi (7463), Zhu Kaijun (2221), Yu Qingjun (3261) and Japanese officer (167) , having heard the alarm, entered the alley to pursue. The thieves opened fire, injuring the Chinese and Japanese officers. As a result, the reserve team of Chinese and Western detectives helped apprehend five thieves from Jiangbei: Chen Weizhi, Chong Guoxi, Li Fuxin, Huang Yushan, and Sun Yanzhou. The details have been reported in this newspaper and were taken into the Jiading Road police station. The three Chinese officers were sent to the Police Hospital, and the Japanese officer was sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Chen and the other four thieves to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and requested detention. He said that the gunshot wounds of all the officers were in their arms and legs and were not life-threatening. A large string of stolen silver chains and locks were presented as evidence. After Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendants, he ordered that they be returned to custody and the case to be reinvestigated.</p>

<p>The Ningbo fishing boat Jin Liyuan recently loaded timber and paper goods in Fuzhou and set sail for Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, when sailing in the waters off Taizhou, it encountered a hurricane and anchored in the port on the south bank of Taizhou to take shelter from the storm. The next morning, the shipowner, Fang Mengrong, instructed the crew not to sail because there were pirates ahead. After the wind and waves subsided, they weighed anchor and sailed. They saw a large three-masted ship approaching. As it drew near, it fired two shots into the air. Fang's ship tried its best to sail, and bamboo bows were placed on both sides of the ship. Unexpectedly, another pirate ship blocked the way, preventing Jin Liyuan from escaping. At that time, four or five of Fang's crew members were injured by bullets. Seeing this, they had to lower the sails and stop. Two pirate ships surrounded them, and the pirates rushed aboard with guns, behaving very aggressively. When they saw the bamboo bows on either side, the pirates became furious and began to beat people indiscriminately and ransack everything. All the silver dollars, crew members' luggage, and bedding were stolen. The timber in the cargo hold was too heavy to steal. Before leaving, they abducted the accountant and fled east. After the pirates left, the owner of Fang's ship saw that most of the crew members were injured and the ship itself was damaged by bullets and could not sail. He hired a tugboat to tow it to Zhenhai, where he sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. Three crew members died from their injuries. Yesterday, Fang took the Xinjin Tianlun steamer to Shanghai and reported the incident to various cargo companies, pleading for the rescue of the abducted accountant.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Escape from Death - Still Unrepentant - Zhang Ziliang Was Once Sentenced to Death - Now Implicated in Another Theft Case <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Ziliang, also known as Ma Pi A Kang, a native of Ningbo, is now 41 years old. In 1914, he committed a major crime and was arrested, sent to the former Military Governor's Office, and sentenced to be shot. The sentence was never carried out because of the political upheaval at the time. However, shortly after his release, he was arrested again and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was imprisoned until March 8th, 1925, when he was released. It can be said that he escaped death and should have strived to be a good person. However, on the 19th of last month, the home of Xu Yuchun, who runs a money shop at 10, Lane 232, Qipu Road, was suddenly robbed by a group of armed bandits. Afterwards, Detective Shang Wu of the Huisibang Police Station arrested eleven bandits and seized four handguns. According to the bandits, Zhang Ziliang was also an accomplice and supplied them with firearms. Detective Shang immediately purchased a lead to arrest Zhang. On the night of the 17th, at 9 PM, he learned that Zhang was hiding in room 514 of the Dahua Hotel on Xizang Road. He rushed to the scene with detectives and captured Zhang. However, Zhang vehemently denied colluding with others to rob with weapons. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Zhang to the First Special District Court and brought the previously arrested bandits to court for questioning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that Zhang had not admitted to the robbery, and the police still needed to investigate, so they could not prosecute Zhang yet. He requested temporary detention and further investigation before prosecution. Judge Liu then questioned the bandit who claimed Zhang was an accomplice. The bandit suddenly said that he had previously borrowed money from Zhang but was rejected, so he made false accusations out of spite, and now he felt he should not have done so. Zhang still denied being a thief. The victim, Xu Yuchun, hired lawyer Ge Zhaoji to appear in court, requesting that the bandits be severely punished. Judge Liu ruled that the case still needed to be investigated, so he ordered that all parties be returned to custody and the hearing be rescheduled.</p>

<p>Dong Jianyuan, a native of Shandong, who lives at 271 Fuli Road in the French Concession, is 33 years old and works as mailman number 807 at the 18th Postal District branch in Shanghai. He used to be a mailman at the Harbin Post Office in the Northeast. After the Northeast fell, he was transferred to Tianjin and finally to Shanghai. He has been serving in the post office for five or six years. He earns 53 yuan a month, collecting mail from mailboxes on various roads. Recently, due to financial difficulties, he had a wild idea. When collecting mail from post boxes on various roads every day, he secretly took out several or dozens of letters. He would peel off the stamps on the letters and sell them for money, and then tear up and discard the letters from which the stamps had been removed, thinking that no one would know. However, recently, people have often come to the post office to inquire about undelivered letters, so the bureau ordered a secret investigation. At around 6 PM the other afternoon, investigator No. 2 found Dong collecting letters from the post box at Shengmuyuan Bridge on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. The investigator saw that Dong was hiding the letters he collected from the post box in his own pocket, so he stepped forward to question him. Dong's face turned red, and he was unable to answer. The investigator then found nearly 60 letters in his pocket and arrested Dong along with the stolen letters. Detective Zhang Daorong and Bao Detective Shen Jinshi took Dong to his home to search and found a large number of letters, which they brought back to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Qiu Huan-ying presided over the trial. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case and prosecuted him for dereliction of duty and theft. The plaintiff, the representative of the Postal Administration, and the witness, investigator So-and-so, stated the process of discovering and catching the defendant. When questioned, Dong admitted to stealing stamps and destroying letters. The court verified the confession and ruled that the case still needed to be investigated, so they ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for May 4th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

He called the Old Zha Criminal Police Station and a rescue vehicle was summoned to rush him to Renji Hospital. Efforts to save him were ineffective, and he soon died. The police station dispatched Chinese detectives to investigate. A suicide note was found near the deceased's body, addressed to the hotel, which read: "I am committing suicide in your hotel because I am suffering from a bad environment, mental confusion, and a lack of interest in life. I came to Shanghai this afternoon without saying goodbye to my family. I leave behind a watch and $1.60, which should be given to Mr. Yao." The police then took the body to the Pei Lun Road morgue.

They also arrested Bian Wuchang for the crime of harboring a criminal, and both were transferred to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. This was detailed in a previous report. It is now known that during the investigation, the detectives found that Wang Afu (age 21, from Suzhou), a vendor residing at No. 44, Jiuyuan Lane, Yalu Road, Hongkou, was Chen Jinlan's follower.

<h3 id="e182">Significant Progress in the Smallpox Vaccination Work of the Municipal Council's Health Department: Over 90,000 People Vaccinated in March <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Municipal Council's Health Department, the smallpox vaccination work in March of this year was unexpectedly successful. A total of 93,306 people were vaccinated throughout the month. On March 16th alone, the day of the Flower Festival, as many as 25,930 people were vaccinated. This year, cases of smallpox have been almost non-existent, and the public's enthusiasm for vaccination is a welcome phenomenon. The work on the Flower Festival day was largely due to the assistance of Chinese and foreign volunteers, which made it possible to create an unprecedented record. In the past, medical officers in the concession put a lot of effort into promoting vaccination. In 1870, the Municipal Council established free vaccination facilities, and the Shanghai Daotai also issued a notice prohibiting the old method of vaccination. In 1894, the Municipal Council established a smallpox vaccination branch, which was also greatly supported by the Chinese officials. However, because the method of compulsion relied only on persuasion, progress was very slow. As of 19--, only 4,600 people were vaccinated by the Health Department throughout the year. Compared with recent years, when over 200,000 people are vaccinated each year, the difference is significant.</p>
<p>Since 1910, a total of 1,435,000 people have been vaccinated with cowpox by the Health Department. A large amount of vaccine has also been distributed to various hospitals and charitable organizations. Therefore, it is estimated that over 2.5 million people have been protected from smallpox. However, given the high mobility of Shanghai's population, the risk of infection still exists at any time, so it is necessary to continue to work hard on vaccination.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Popularity of "The Death of Lingyu" <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The performance of "The Death of Lingyu" at the Gong Stage is a real-life drama that has caused a social sensation no less than the "Yan Ruisheng" case performed at the New Stage more than ten years ago. The play uses both gongs and drums and piano and phonograph, opening up a new path between Peking opera and spoken drama. In terms of scenery, places such as Kunshan Garden, Taikoo Wharf, Qinyuan Village, Great Light Cinema, Sino-Western Sanatorium, and International Funeral Home are as realistic as the real scenes. Moreover, the presence of cars and trams on stage is particularly novel and grand. Tong Yuejuan plays Zhang Zhiyun, Han Suqiu plays Ruan Lingyu, Chuan Xiaobo plays Tang Jishan, and Xia Yinpei plays Zhang Damin, all imitating their spirit and demeanor with eight or nine points of similarity. Therefore, since its premiere, it has been performed for half a month, and the popularity has not diminished. This shows the extent to which the play is welcomed by the public.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Sir, today your newspaper's news section carried an item about the British Commercial Kwong Company reducing rent. After investigation, our company has not reduced rent in the Pengpu Road area.

As for Hengfeng Lane on Wusong Road, it is not our company's property. We are afraid that there will be misunderstandings, so we have specially written to your newspaper to correct the matter and request that it be published in the Letters to the Editor section.

<p>— Chen Lifu</p>
<p>—Opening Address of the National Reading Movement Congress—</p>
<p>The Chinese Cultural Construction Association held the National Reading Movement Congress from April 8th to 21st. Mr. Chen Lifu, the chairman of the association, requested Mr. Zhang Daofan, a director, to broadcast the opening address of the National Reading Movement Congress at 8:00 AM on April 8th at the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station. The main points of his speech were instructed by Mr. Lifu. Afterwards, his speech was edited and published. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, today is the first day of the National Reading Movement Congress organized by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association. I would like to report the important significance of holding this National Reading Movement Congress to all the beloved comrades and compatriots across the country. We all deeply feel the precariousness of the nation's position and the perilousness of the national situation. We believe that at this critical moment, the national revival movement is the self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-striving that every citizen should possess. In recent years, the central government's measures in military affairs, politics, party affairs, and education have all stemmed from this major premise of the national revival movement. However, we firmly believe that the strength or weakness, prosperity or decline of a nation is entirely based on whether its culture is flourishing or not. Therefore, on the eve of the national revival movement, we should have a vigorous and practical cultural revival movement. We should use the cultural revival movement to lay a deep and solid foundation for the national revival movement. Moreover, only if the cultural revival movement succeeds can the national revival movement not be empty talk and can it be realized as scheduled.</p>
<p>If we want to revive our culture, we must first have a prerequisite. This prerequisite is how to restore the nation's confidence in building culture. If the general public does not have confidence in building culture, then it is truly the so-called "nothing is more sorrowful than a dead heart." What hope is there to speak of? The so-called self-confidence means having something within oneself. To explain it more practically, it means first having self-awareness. The old problem of the Chinese people is that they either exaggerate themselves or belittle themselves. This problem of excess and deficiency is the biggest reason why the Chinese nation cannot make progress. In terms of culture, those who exaggerate themselves advocate extreme restoration of the old, while those who belittle themselves advocate complete Westernization. These two extreme views not only do not benefit Chinese culture but are likely to lead our country into an even more chaotic and dark situation. Therefore, our attitude towards reviving national culture should be neither blindly exaggerating nor blindly belittling ourselves, but rather taking the spirit of self-reliance and self-help, learning from others' strengths, and making up for our own weaknesses to build a world's healthiest new culture. At the same time, we must do our best to contribute to others to demonstrate the inherent characteristics of our nation.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, we should determine our attitude towards the past, present, and future. In the history of the world, our country's cultural brilliance has been unparalleled. This is an undeniable fact. Stretching tens of thousands of miles and spanning thousands of years, there have been countless sages and heroes who have displayed their intelligence and built their careers, winning glory for the Chinese nation. However, in the past hundred years, due to material inferiority and lack of self-defense, we have repeatedly failed in foreign wars, and national rights and interests have been lost day by day. As a result, the general public has embarked on a path of decadence and discouragement, thinking that China is inferior to others in everything and that the legacy passed down by our ancestors is not worth cherishing. In fact, this is a major fallacy. We must know that our intelligence and ability are not inferior to any excellent nation, and the elaboration and creation of various academic systems in history cannot be erased by anyone. Therefore, for the sake of establishing a brand-new and healthy culture for the nation, we should not adopt a purely dismissive attitude towards the past culture. We should actively use scientific methods to sort out all the cultural relics accumulated by the inherent intelligence of our ancestors, taking what should be taken and discarding what should be discarded. Only after the inherent culture has been sorted out by scientific methods can it be sifted like gold from sand, becoming useful, radiant, and inexhaustible.</p>
<p>The reason why our country is in a semi-colonial position today has its historical causes and is also due to the psychological suicide of some of our people. Because the establishment of a sound culture emphasizes both the development of spiritual culture and the creation of material culture. Our past culture emphasized spiritual aspects, while European and American culture emphasized material aspects. Therefore, after the contact between China and the West, Western guns and cannons destroyed the ancient Great Wall. Our country suffered loss of power and territory due to material inferiority, and was marked by shame. Assuming that the general public could have realized this early, studied the points of failure, and strived for self-salvation, then the history of China in the past hundred years would not have been scarred to this day. The most heartbreaking thing is that since the Opium War, Chinese intellectuals have lost their self-confidence, and the entire Chinese nation has lost the treasure of self-confidence, which is the foundation of a nation. As a result, the wheels of time have moved forward relentlessly, only creating a situation where our country is getting worse and worse. Our culture's emphasis on the development of the spiritual aspect is a historical cause, but the Chinese people's loss of the treasure of self-confidence is a psychological suicide. What about Chinese intellectuals now? Are they aware? Many people are still living a romantic life in a passive and decadent way, taking a cold and detached attitude towards the rise and fall of the nation and the survival of the country. They do not recognize the root of the nation's and country's illness, nor do they see through the path that modern Chinese society needs to strive for. If everyone is like this, how can China have hope? Therefore, we must not hold a passive and detached attitude. We should restore national self-confidence and recognize that modern China, lacking material culture, needs scientific knowledge to enrich it and improve the level of social culture.</p>
<p>We can thoroughly sort out the past culture, and we can thoroughly enrich the current needs, saving the dying nation from the root, but we must not be satisfied with this. We must know that the life of the nation, we should not only fulfill the responsibility of maintaining it, and prolonging its life, but also promote and develop it for the sake of the whole world and all mankind. If we want to achieve this great goal and fulfill this sacred mission, we must use the scientific spirit to promote and develop the life of the nation, use scientific methods to sort out everything in the past, use scientific knowledge to enrich everything in the present, and use scientific spirit to create everything in the future. These are the three major tasks of the Chinese cultural revival movement, and the three major routes for building Chinese national culture. To complete this review, (organize the past, grasp (enrich) the present, and create the future, we should start from (1) being studious, (2) striving to act, and (3) knowing shame.</p>
<p>Being studious means competing with others in intelligence. The modern world is a world of intellectual competition. The intellectually strong win, and the intellectually weak lose. There is no luck in the way of survival. If we want to use scientific methods to sort out everything in the past, use scientific knowledge to enrich everything in the present, and use the scientific spirit to develop everything in the future, we must deal with it with great intelligence. Intelligence training and cultivation lie in being studious. Striving to act means competing with others in ability. The Chinese people have long been poisoned by the idea that "it is not difficult to know, but it is difficult to act." The reason why we have failed in everything and accomplished nothing is that we cannot strive to act. Therefore, we should strive to act with the spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen that it is easy to act and difficult to know. The way to revive culture lies in this, and the way to revive the nation also lies in this. Knowing shame means making up for the lack of knowledge and ability in order to prepare for avenging shame. As the saying goes, "Knowing shame is close to courage." If we have the self-awareness of knowing shame, we should have the preparation for avenging shame. The preparation for avenging shame lies in making up for the lack of intelligence. Therefore, being able to make up for the lack of intelligence is clear evidence of knowing shame. If everyone can be studious, then what foreigners know, we will all know. If everyone can strive to act, then what foreigners can do, we will all be able to do. If everyone knows shame, then their intelligence will be sufficient, national shame can be avenged at any time, and the national foundation can be revived at any time. If every person can be down-to-earth and earnestly do these three things: "being studious," "striving to act," and "knowing shame," I firmly believe that the success of the cultural revival movement and the success of the national revival movement are just around the corner.</p>
<p>Youth is the soul of the country and the backbone of the nation. The strength of the country and the prosperity or decline of the nation are determined by the will of the youth and the direction of their efforts. We only hope that the youth who are studying now will make full use of their time in school, and the youth who are working will make full use of their spare time. Not only youth, but also children, adults, and the elderly, can all strive to do these three things: "being studious," "striving to act," and "knowing shame." Then, there will be no problem in promoting and developing the Chinese nation and creating a first-class civilized country in the world. The significance of the Reading Progress Competition held by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association and the National Reading Movement Congress held from today onwards lies in our greatest hope and highest enthusiasm that all comrades and compatriots across the country will participate in this reading movement and achieve the goal of "saving the Chinese nation from the root and working hard to meet the challenge."</p>
<p>In view of the perilousness of the nation's position, empty talk of saving the country is ineffective. The great cause of saving the country does not lie in empty talk but in practice. Moreover, we should start from ourselves. Starting from ourselves is the most practical and easiest way. Scholars should intensify their studies, farmers should intensify production, workers should improve their skills, and businessmen should promote domestic goods. Each should start from their own position and work hard. China will certainly have infinite hope. At the same time, we should pay more attention to the fact that the progress of agriculture, industry, and commerce will not be successful without the increase of scholars' knowledge. Because the increase of rural production, the progress of industrial skills, and the development of businessmen's patriotism are all important goals of education and the greatest goals of the reading movement.</p>
<p>To give a simple example, everyone knows that future wars will be three-dimensional wars, and the air force will occupy a decisive position in future battles. Therefore, in recent years, the entire country has been committed to saving the country through aviation. However, the content of the two words "aviation" includes many specialized knowledge. Taking the manufacturing of an aircraft as an example, it requires mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mining and metallurgical engineering, chemical engineering, textile engineering, etc. The construction of the airport and the lighting equipment require the design of civil engineering and physics and chemistry experts. Saving the country through aviation certainly requires economy and financial resources, but what is even more needed is manpower and academic ability. Can we save the country by simply buying hundreds or thousands of aircraft from foreign countries? Only when we can manufacture and fly aircraft ourselves can we talk about saving the country through aviation. If we hope to manufacture it ourselves, we need to read books and study science. Who doesn't know the bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas? Who doesn't know that if we don't save the rural areas, China will perish soon? However, can saving the rural areas be done through empty talk? Everything requires real measures. Therefore, at this critical moment, we should be down-to-earth, earnestly do our work, and meet the urgent needs of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>For the needs of national defense and production, the Chinese Cultural Construction Association has organized a reading progress competition and held a National Reading Movement Congress, hoping that all comrades and compatriots across the country will understand this important significance, practice it personally, and know that enriching one's own academic ability is enriching the strength of the nation, and building one's own intelligence is building the culture of the nation. When the cultural revival movement is completed, it will be the day when the cornerstone of the national revival movement is laid. The end.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Zhang Sumin Speaks on How to Study Economics <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the tenth day of the National Reading Movement Congress organized by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association. The association specially invited Dr. Zhang Sumin, Director of the Banking Department of National Jinan University, to speak on how to study economics. The following is a transcript of the speech:</p>
<p>Today, I am honored to be invited by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association to speak on the topic of "How to Study Economics." I will share my humble views with you.</p>
<p>The Importance of Economics Economic life occupies the largest part of human life. The so-called economic life includes all activities such as the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of wealth. Farms, factories, shops, offices, transportation agencies, etc., are the locations of production and distribution. All buying and selling belong to exchange, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation, etc., belong to consumption. We rise at the crowing of the rooster and go out to work or office, wanting to serve production and distribute a portion so that we can exchange it for other things to satisfy the desire for consumption. Although I am not a proponent of the monistic economic history view, I cannot but admit the great influence of economic life on other aspects of life. The Confucians have the saying that one should enrich the people first and then teach them. Guanzi has the theory of sufficient clothing and food, and full granaries. It can be seen that our ancient sages had already seen this. Economics is the science of studying economic life, and its importance is self-evident. In addition, modern economic situations are becoming increasingly complex, and to understand them clearly, we rely more on the study of economics.</p>
<p>The Object of Economics In the past, scholars thought that economics was only the science of studying human activities such as acquiring wealth and using wealth. They recognized that the object of economics was wealth, etc. Modern scholars think that economics is the science of studying the relationship between people caused by activities such as acquiring wealth and using wealth and how to increase people's happiness. Therefore, they recognize that the object of economics is happiness. For example, when we study the Chinese economy, we should not only focus on developing production and raising the level of consumption, but also focus on how developing production can benefit the common people and how it can raise the level of consumption and increase the happiness of the common people.</p>
<p>Methods of Entry The methods of entry to study economics can be divided into two types: one is to study the basic principles of economics, and the other is to study practical economic problems. If you want to study the basic principles, you should start with textbooks. Those who can read Western texts can choose a "standard textbook," such as Ely's "Outlines of Economics" or Bye's "Principles of Economics." Those who read Chinese texts can choose to read Wang Jianzu's translation of "Kitt's Economics" or Chen Jiazan's translation of "Tsumura Hidematsu's Economics." After reading a book carefully and referring to two or three books, you can know the general outline of the basic principles. As for studying practical economic problems, such as those concerning the world, you can read a book on "Economic Problems" in Western languages. There are many books of this kind in Western languages, and you can choose one. As for those concerning China, there are very few books of this kind. As far as I know, Mr. Ma Yinchu's new book "The Reconstruction of the Chinese Economy" has detailed discussions on various important economic problems in China. It can be called the first book on "Chinese Economic Problems." The "Business Report of the 23rd Year" recently published by the Bank of China speaks clearly about the economic situation last year. In addition, we should pay attention to the economic news and essays published in Chinese and Western newspapers and magazines. As long as we pay attention, we can study less data anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>Specialized Research Each topic included in an economics book can be used as a lifelong specialized research, such as currency, banking, labor, transportation, distribution, consumption, management, and other items, all of which can be studied with a lifetime of effort. Those who love to study ideological theories can also make the history of world economic thought a major topic. We can choose a topic according to our own interests and do in-depth specialized research.</p>
<p>Application of Theory We study economics not only for "intellectual exercise." We should seek to solve problems. Former scholars divided economics into "pure economics" and "applied economics," thinking that the former is the study of principles and the latter is the solution of problems. In fact, this kind of classification is modeled on natural sciences. In terms of economics, this kind of classification is not very appropriate. The principle of economics is the principle of discussing problems. If the principle cannot solve the problem, it loses the qualification of the principle. We should seek to discover new principles in the study of problems. Therefore, after we have a clear understanding of all existing principles, we should consider the environment and temporarily propose a plan for the solution of practical problems. The basis of the proposed plan may be the old principles or the new principles determined by the integration of the old principles and according to the environment of the problem. To achieve this level, we must study deeply and have rich insights.</p>

<p>— (Reclining Buddha)</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy to be a person in society. Not easy, of course, means "difficult." Divided and classified, there are three types of difficulty in being a person: one is "difficult to be a person," one is "being a difficult person," and one is "being a person is difficult."</p>
<p>"Difficult to be a person" - living in such a society with an increasingly high standard of living, especially under the economic downturn, one must not only shoulder the heavy burden of supporting elders and raising children, but also deal with the social obligations of relatives and friends. For such a person, is it difficult or not?</p>
<p>"Being a difficult person" - you are motivated by patriotic enthusiasm to engage in national salvation movements, but people say you are too radical, even saying you are reactionary; but if you put the rise and fall of the country out of your mind and do not express yourself, people will say that you have no national concept. There are many other similar situations. For such a person, is it difficult or not?</p>
<p>"Being a person is difficult" - as a person, one should do some beneficial things for society and make some contributions to the country. But this requires both knowledge and opportunity. Without this knowledge and opportunity, your life is in vain, failing the country, failing society, and failing yourself. For such a person, is it difficult or not?</p>
<p>However, there is no "difficult" word in Napoleon's dictionary. We must also break through this "difficult" word!</p>

<p>— Zhou Yimin</p>
<p>The weather is so muggy that it almost makes everyone sleepy. Although spring has arrived, it seems that everyone is going to the countryside to be active. However, upon closer thought, it is just a magnification of sleeping.</p>
<p>"Spring sleep doesn't realize dawn, everywhere you hear birds chirping." In the big city, there is no such elegant sleep as in poetry. After all, every morning, it is always so noisy, and it also makes everyone go to the street to taste the smell of feces. The sound of the chamber pot rustling is like the prelude to a stinky song.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dust on the road is always rolling with the trams and cars, rolling onto everyone's body, rolling into everyone's mouth, rolling into everyone's eyes... Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, once said that when walking on the streets of Shanghai, you must remember to lock your mouth tightly. If you open it, you will eat dust, and maybe you will eat various infectious diseases.</p>
<p>On the outside, everything looks good, but at heart, it's a mess. You see many people are working for the welfare of the public, but if you look at them with a microscope, their starting point is all about making more money.</p>
<p>All kinds of experts are showing off. Their business is particularly prosperous in this otherwise depressed economy. They fool around with this and that, making some stupid people like ants on a hot pot. They are willing to be fooled.</p>
<p>Enough, enough, no need to write more. Let's write this article for self-praise and praise of others.</p>
<h3 id="e228">A Record of Viewing the Relics of the Pingquan Study <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Mr. Li Pingshu, whose name is recorded in the Party history, has been dead for many years. Mr. Li had an elegant temperament. All his salary was used to buy paintings and calligraphy of the past, which he enjoyed playing with in his bright window, taking it as a pleasure. At that time, the famous painter and calligrapher Mr. Wang Nianci participated in Mr. Li's literary circle, and there was hardly a day when he didn't identify and comment on the works. People in the country all knew that the collection of Pingquan Study was rich and abundant, and its accumulation was vast, making it unattainable. Pingquan Study was the name of Mr. Li's studio. Mr. Li's grandson, Xiangfu, loved paintings and calligraphy as much as his grandfather. He treasured them as precious objects. Recently, Mr. Wang Nianci has been setting up his studio on the top floor of Qiugu Zhai on Third Ma Road. The crystal windows are bright and clear, providing a great joy of painting and calligraphy. Mr. Xiangfu, for the convenience of airing the books, wished to display them in the studio for the public to view. Nianci was an old friend of mine, and he invited me to view the works. There were two or three hundred paintings and calligraphies. The most precious one was a huge landscape painting by Huang Gongwang, which had been transported to Tokyo in the past, and people in the East unanimously praised it. It won an award and returned. Looking at it, the spirit is mellow and appropriate, and the brush and ink are noble and pure, which is indeed something that people of the time could not dream of. It is truly a feast for the eyes! Emperor Huizong of Song's painting of an eagle, in its golden splendor, has a magnificent and vigorous atmosphere, making it an especially precious and rare item. The rarest ones are the calligraphy works of Wang Yuyang and Yuan Suiyuan. We usually recite their poems and essays, and once we see their genuine works, how can our longing hearts restrain themselves? In addition to calligraphy and painting, Nianci is also proficient in the art of physiognomy. Among the books on physiognomy, he considers the seven chapters of Bingjian to be the most refined and insightful. The name of the author of this book is not mentioned, making it a secret manual. Zeng Guofan of Xiangxiang highly praised this chapter, calling it the standard of physiognomy and a book that must be read. Nianci accidentally obtained a copy of it, but it was half-eaten by bookworms, so he personally proofread it and recorded the entire chapter, storing it in lithography to prevent it from being lost. He generously presented me with a copy. The so-called seven chapters are: one, spirit and bones; two, firmness and softness; three, appearance; four, emotion; five, eyebrows and beard; six, voice; and seven, complexion. Even in terms of literary expression, it is elegant and readable, washing away the vulgar habits. Kuai Tong looking at the back, Xunzi discussing the heart - a unique book, shared with like-minded people. Nianci's contribution cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Ashamed of Nakedness, Avoiding Guests Behind Curtains, Diligently Copying Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Young people always like young people. Ever since the encounter at Beihai, Yueying had a feeling that this man was good. Today, she was sleeping naked in someone else's quilt, and it just so happened that he arrived, which could be described as extremely coincidental. Immediately, a rush of heat rose from the soles of her feet straight to her face. Wang Beihai walked into the room and saw that the curtain was down. The door was also slightly ajar, as if Mr. Cheng wasn't sleeping in the bed. If he were sleeping in the bed, how could the door be ajar? Looking under the bed, there were no shoes either, which made it even clearer that the bed was empty. Without hesitation, he walked straight to the bedside, and just as he was about to reach out to lift the curtain, Yueying saw it very clearly and couldn't help but let out a startled cry. Wang Beihai was taken aback and took two steps back. He was stunned for a moment, then took two more steps back, thinking that it was clearly a woman's voice. How could a woman be lying in the bed of someone as proper as Mr. Cheng? This was strange. Since he wasn't in the room, it wasn't convenient for him to be here either. He should leave and close the door as if he hadn't entered, so as not to expose the matter and embarrass Mr. Cheng. Thinking this, he walked out, and just as he was leaving the room, he bumped into a tea server. He whispered with a smile, "There's a woman sleeping in Mr. Cheng's room. What's going on?" The tea server, who was a busybody, then explained how Yueying had fallen into the muddy water and was temporarily hiding here, waiting for clothes to change into. (186)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The lives of these shoe-making artisans are also extremely monotonous; their inner selves seem to never receive any stimulation, and even slight tremors are rare. Year after year, they are solely dedicated to making phoenix shoes: waking up in the morning, working during the day, eating, and going to bed at night, doing such monotonous work every day. I myself cannot endure it, so I think that since they can enjoy it year after year, they must have an interest that outsiders cannot appreciate. I remember once asking the two leading old maids, and they both said they were very happy, the only reason being that they had a special love for this embroidery life. This shoe-making industry not only allows them to fully develop their embroidery skills, but also contains a sense of beauty in making shoe patterns, matching soles, etc., which is enough to stimulate the interest of art lovers. Their happiness probably comes from this. This is a very reasonable statement. Because no matter whom we teach to do a job, the weight of the job itself may not be a concern, the most important thing is that the job must suit the person's nature; any job that suits one's nature will surely be done with enthusiasm, and with enthusiasm, it can be done especially well and will last without getting tired. Now these two old maids are like that. As for the eight young girls under their hands? Although I have not asked them, I think the situation is roughly the same; because anyone who is not used to this work has already taken sick leave, and the rest are naturally people who are genuinely interested in it!

<h3 id="e231">Water Prison <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— By Defu</p>
<p>"The three bitterest trades in the world are rowing boats, blacksmithing, and grinding tofu." Everyone knows this, but in addition to these three, I have discovered another bitter job, the degree of which is no less than the above three.</p>
<p>Every time we enter a bathhouse, we always see several back scrubbers soaked in water, their skin pale and devoid of blood. Every day, they are immersed in the water prison from 10:00 AM to 2:00 AM the next day, a total of sixteen hours. Day after day, year after year, they live like this. Even if there is a change, it is only a transfer from one water prison to another. All year round, because of the immersion in water and the steaming heat, their skin turns as white as paper, and the blood in their whole body is diluted by the water and heat. This is not all. They also have to work. Every bather, from head to toe, has to pass through their hands. After scrubbing backs, removing dirt, and bathing everyone, they sweat all over. Sweat is something everyone should have, but they sweat too much, resulting in a pale person. Living like this, no matter how strong a person is, they will weaken day by day. They themselves know that this job is harmful to the body, but they have already taken up this profession, driven by life, and they know they are entering hell, but there is no way to save it.</p>
<p>Rowing boats, blacksmithing, and grinding tofu are certainly bitter, but I think the back scrubbers in the bathhouse are indeed more bitter than them. Every time we bathe, we sometimes get dizzy because of the long time, but the back scrubbers have to continue working in the bathhouse for sixteen hours every day. What a painful thing this is!</p>
<p>I say they are sitting in a water prison, is that not an exaggeration!</p>

<h3 id="e233">Qingdao: A Japanese Hue <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— By Nangongsheng</p>
<p>Qingdao was originally a desolate peninsula. After being leased to Germany during the late Qing Dynasty, the Germans gradually developed it, building fortresses and docks, and it became a good military port and summer resort in our country. In 1914, during the European War, Japan seized Qingdao while Germany was unable to look east, and regarded it as its own colony, working hard to develop it and gradually assimilate the customs of Qingdao. Although the sovereignty of most of the island was returned after negotiations at the Washington Conference, the island was already full of Japanese colors, especially in the spring when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, fully revealing the scenery of the Japanese islands, as if it had become a Japanese semi-colony. Even the Japanese government has never forgotten that Qingdao is a place where its power can reach.</p>
<p>In spring, the cherry blossoms in various parts of Qingdao bloom in profusion, and can be seen everywhere. Cherry blossoms are the national flower of Japan, and when they are in full bloom, the whole country goes wild. At this time, Qingdao also holds cherry blossom festivals, and the people of the whole island play all day long, especially the Japanese residents, who are extremely happy. In the first park, shrines, and other places where cherry blossoms are planted everywhere, Japanese sentiments can be seen and heard everywhere.</p>
<p>Qingdao's shrines enshrine Japanese Shintoism, and many Japanese people are often seen worshiping there, but the temples of Buddhism and Taoism, which have been passed down in our country for thousands of years, have never been seen once.</p>
<p>Buried under the Loyal Souls Monument are the loyal souls of the Japanese soldiers who died in the battle to seize Qingdao. The style of construction is entirely Japanese in architecture and style. Similar Loyal Souls Monuments can be seen in Japan. Especially when Japanese soldiers salute at the monument, it makes people wonder if Qingdao is a Japanese colony.</p>
<p>The architecture on the island, apart from tall foreign houses, is mostly Japanese-style houses. In the area near Liaocheng Road, it is impossible to find a building that is not Japanese-style. The residents are all Japanese in kimonos. None of the shops sell anything but Japanese goods. Even on the most prosperous Zhongshan Road, Japanese shops are probably two-thirds of the total! The most common dishes in the small vegetable market are Japanese fish and seaweed.</p>
<p>There are Japanese cafes on the island, with Japanese maids arranged in the cafes. There are Japanese theaters, performing Japanese-style song and dance dramas. There are Japanese waiting places and brothels, full of Japanese prostitutes. There are Japanese police stations, Japanese restaurants, and all kinds of other shops run by Japanese people. Everything that exists in Japan is lacking in Qingdao. No wonder Japanese people can regard Qingdao as their own territory when they arrive, because the entire Qingdao area is completely Japanese in color.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Finance: Gold Speculation Initially Firm, Then Weak; Foreign Exchange Boosts Bullish Sentiment, Market Very Lively; Buyers Stand Aside, Prices Fall Back Six Yuan <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market rose due to the continued decline in silver prices and the tightening of the foreign exchange market, and the market was quite strong. However, because sellers were active at high prices, it soon fell back. Later trading was light and lacked support, and the result was a decline. In the early morning, overseas silver markets fell across the board. Speculators said that after the market closed, transactions were made below the listed price of 0.0625 to 0.125. Forward silver markets in Montgomery were mixed, exchange rates contracted, and London spot gold did not change. Off-market pre-market trading opened and rose to over 20 yuan, but sentiment was not very firm. After opening, the central bank's listed prices were announced, both British and American currencies contracted, and the customs gold unit rose by 1.1%, and the standard gold speculation price rose to 866.7 yuan, and then rose. Although there was a setback, the banks worked hard to consolidate, and the internal market for the US dollar was very tight, and the situation was particularly strong. The banks took advantage of the high price to release sterling, and large investors sold bars and the price fell. At this time, the HSBC bank's listed prices were announced, British currency contracted by 0.125, American currency contracted by 0.3125, the foreign exchange market was still tight and there were many orders, and the white silver balance tax was announced and did not move, and had no impact. Afterwards, the Guang Bang [Guangdong merchants' guild] released some, the internal market slightly loosened, sellers were eager, and broke through the 20 yuan mark, and gradually went downstream. However, large investors bravely entered at low prices, and the bank's buying appetite was still strong, so even though Sassoon released, it was easy to pull up after the low. At noon, it was in a hovering state, and the later market was stable. The foreign exchange market was quite tight, but the gold market lacked transactions, and left the upward trend. Although there was a slight increase at one point, the buying interest was temporary, and latecomers were extremely eager, and finally settled. Indian silver fell slightly twice, and at this time there was still maintenance, and the overall situation was even more boring. Afterwards, buyers suddenly stood aside, and many short positions were closed, and rumors arose, stimulating selling. Due to the holidays, there were even fewer opponents in the market, resulting in oversupply, and a sudden drop. The market situation for the whole day was extremely calm due to the Spring Festival holiday. Now I will record the market situation for the day,</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 820.2 yuan, an increase of 1.1 yuan compared to the previous close. The central bank's customs gold listing was announced to rise by 1.1%.

<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegrams, the near and far terms of the London bulk contract shrank by 0.1875. The market claimed that transactions were made below the listed price of 0.0625 to 0.125 after the market closed. The New York silver market shrank by 0.025, and the Montgomery silver price was mixed, with increases of 0.003 and decreases of 0.005, respectively. London spot gold did not move, British currency against American currency shrank by 0.0625, American currency against British currency was slightly less than half a point, and British currency against French currency fell by 2 pounds. American currency against French currency shrank by 0.075. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of one shilling seven pence 0.5625 and 0.625 against sterling, and the US dollar at 39.5625 yuan, compared to the previous close, the British currency was flat and the American currency was tight by 0.0625, due to the decline in exchange rates. The central bank's listed prices were announced, both British and American currencies shrank, and the customs gold unit rose by 1.1%. The standard gold speculation price rose to 866.7 yuan, but Chinese merchants still had an appetite to sell. Afterwards, the banks worked hard to consolidate, and the US dollar process was tight. The banks tended to produce sterling. The HSBC bank's listing was announced, British currency shrank by 0.125, American currency shrank by 0.3125, at this time the status was hovering, and after the white silver balance tax did not change, it also did not have much impact, but the Chinese merchants' psychology gradually became difficult to support, and in addition, some gangs slightly had an appetite to sell, and the process was hard. However, the banks were willing to maintain it, so even though Sassoon was blocked, the noon close was still hovering, and transactions were no longer strong. In the later market, the banks' appetite suddenly improved, and China consolidated the US dollar and tightened, but the Chinese merchants' psychology was not振, and the second drop in Indian silver shrank slightly by a total of 0.0232 anna, and the overall trend was still 盘, and there were not many transactions. Finally, the Chinese merchants supplied a lot due to the downstream of the gold market, and the banks lacked the appetite to accept, so they turned hard. The closing recent selling price was one shilling seven pence and a half, and the US dollar was 39.5 yuan, compared to the previous close, the British currency was tight by 0.09375 and the American currency was tight by 0.125.

<p>Yesterday's call money situation was more firm than the previous day, because starting today, foreign merchants will close for three days due to the foreign Qingming Festival, and it is inevitable that all parties will not have preliminary procedures, resulting in a phenomenon of more overdrafts and a lack of exchange heads. Although the saying of transferring accounts at the end of April has not been fully implemented, the situation is such that the majority is bound to remain, and the same industry's positions are therefore lacking, and the trend of倾轧is difficult to avoid.

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although it was gradually approaching settlement day, the market remained extremely stable. It was slightly loose at first, but then returned to firm. The overall environment was still dull as before, but the call loan interest rate had gradually increased. Whether this was affected by the end of the month depends on the trend of the call loan rate. The three banks' lending is about to be realized. The current difficulty in the money market can be overcome with effort. However, whether it can be active and prosperous in the future still depends on the authorities. The recent market situation is likely to be stimulated by fluctuations due to the imbalance of supply and demand of chips. This is also the usual practice of squeezing shorts and longs as settlement approaches, and mutual oppression is inevitable. Yesterday, the market was weak in the morning, with some longs swapping positions. In the afternoon, shorts swapped positions, and the market price rose slightly again, but it still did not escape the hovering situation. However, considering the large number of chips held in accounts, it is feared that this cannot continue indefinitely. As a result, the market price was slightly better by five cents to two dimes in most cases, with only a few cases of being slightly lower by five cents to one dime. The total turnover was 8,563,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are shown in the comparative table on the left. (Unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>A report from Sin Fung &amp; Co. stated that yesterday (the 17th) the New York stock market experienced loosening under the leadership of railroad stocks because the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway announced a two-month extension for the interest payment on its 4.75% bonds due in 1949. The exchange today reduced the call loan interest rate to 2.5%, which is a record low in history, but failed to stimulate the market and make it active. The bond market was also volatile due to the influence of railroad stocks. Small exchange stocks trended hotter downstream. The total turnover for the day was 850,000 shares.

<p>The yarn market is uniquely firm this month because sellers lack supply to deliver. A certain person has a large amount of yarn but is still unwilling to release it. Japanese merchants are buying up yarn for this month and selling forward months, still making swap moves. Therefore, this month is slowly rising, but the overall situation feels very bleak. However, yarn inventories are relatively dry.</p>
<p>Sellers Lack Chips for Delivery</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton market, all months showed a hovering trend. Because US cotton continued to fall, trading in the market was quite quiet, and the market sentiment felt scattered. However, this month, due to the approaching settlement date, sellers are not delivering much, and floating longs are only enough to offset shorts. The market is uniquely tight, and foreign firms are also offsetting positions, causing the price to rise by three dimes compared to the previous day's closing price. The forward month trend is more frustrated, falling by two or three dimes. The opening in the afternoon was still good, but after trading two or three times, the forward month showed a tired state again. However, the shorts for this month could not continue to offset, causing the price to rise by another two dimes compared to the morning closing price. The forward months fell by one, two, or three dimes. It was found that 200 bales were sold by Jifeng, 250 bales by Dafu, 300 bales by Renfeng, 300 bales by Shengyuan, 200 bales by Deji, 550 bales by Ruid, 550 bales by Changfeng, and 350 bales by Tonghe. 150 bales were bought by Jinchang, 200 bales by Zhenda, 750 bales by Gengfeng, 350 bales by Dafeng, 250 bales by Xinchang, and 550 bales by Hengchang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Increase/Decrease	Inventory</p>
<p>April	183.4	182.9	183.4	Up 0.50	29,050</p>

<p>680 Bales of Spot Yarn Sold to Customers</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were slightly clearer. It was found that a total of 680 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The amount bought by each group is as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market is calm because US cotton continues to fall and Indian cotton rises slightly. However, the gold price is high and exchange rates are slightly shrinking, so people's sentiment is still good. This month is very firm and expensive. According to the market, the cotton inspection office has not yet found any qualified goods by today's deadline, so floating shorts are actively covering. However, forward months are normal, it is said.</p>
<p>Near Zheng Biao [Cotton] [Is] Firm, Forward [Contracts] Flat</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton market, all months presented a stable situation, and the market conditions did not change much. However, US cotton continued to fall by more than ten pounds, and Indian cotton rose by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees. People's sentiment slightly tended to be bearish. Unexpectedly, the gold price rebounded and the exchange rate slightly shrank, and the situation for this month was uniquely tight. Because delivery is not strong, and the current spot cotton price is still stable recently, the result was that the closing price rose by two and a half dimes compared to the previous day. The bank sector did not make up for the selling of forward months, and the market situation was looser, falling by five cents. In the afternoon, there was very little change, but the near month was still hard, falling and then rising again. The result was the same as the previous day's closing price, with the forward months falling by five cents to one dime. It was found that 2,900 dan were sold by Jifeng, 1,600 dan by Dafu, 900 dan by Mingde, 1,300 dan by Senkang, 1,400 dan by Yichang, 2,300 dan by Shengyuan, 1,900 dan by Yongda, 900 dan by Xincheng, and 1,500 dan by Ruid. 1,300 dan were bought by Dafeng, 1,500 dan by Junchang, 1,100 dan by Renfeng, 2,700 dan by Runkang, 900 dan by Sihe, 2,100 dan by Yuanyuanchang, 1,600 dan by Chang, and 2,200 dan by Yi. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Increase/Decrease	Inventory</p>
<p>April	35.30	35.10	35.30	Up 0.25	67,500</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of US cotton, the market conditions were mixed, with each month rising or falling by one to several pounds. Then, with buyers watching, the market price gradually softened. In the afternoon, it was heard that the stock market was depressed, and longs successively liquidated, and the trend became even more unsustainable. The closing was flat. Spot goods fell by 15 pounds, and futures fell by 14 to 18 pounds. UK cotton spot goods rose by 1 point, and futures rose by 45. Indian cotton was firm at first due to public buying, then fell due to long liquidation, and finally rose again due to good spot sales and speculative longs buying. The fruit rain rose by 0.25 rupees, Olm La rose by 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, and White Law Creek rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 17th):</p>

<h3 id="e243">Food: Marked Flour Near Firm, Far Weak <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month was near stable and far weak. The price of foreign wheat fell back by 70 cents in Chicago and about 12 cents in Canada. After the opening, this month, because the current sales were still active and there were many long clients, the factories did not want to sell because of the price increase of current flour, so people's sentiment was good. For forward months, because of the fall in foreign wheat and the sunny weather again, fewer outside buyers, the market also fell. Until the afternoon opening, this month was still firm because of the tight spot goods, and the asking price was firmer. According to speculation in the industry, it may be necessary to reach the 50 cent mark. For the forward months, although the factories did not come out, many longs returned, and the market atmosphere was soft. As a result, this month was better by 1.25 cents, May was better by 7.5 cents, June was lower by 2.5 cents, July was lower by 2.5 cents, August was lower by half a cent, and September was lower by 7.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Forward Wheat Shorts Actively Covering <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the forward wheat market in the morning, each month generally presented a calm appearance. The price of foreign wheat fell by 70 cents in Chicago and about 12 cents in Canada. After the opening price, although foreign wheat fell, sellers in the market were unusually quiet. This was because the spring rain had been too long, which may affect wheat harvesting. Therefore, since there were few sellers, buyers were waiting for the opportunity to move. Until the afternoon opening, the asking price for the near term was still flat, and the forward term was popular due to active covering by shorts in the industry. People's sentiment was quite excited, the buying interest in each transaction was very strong, and the price was very expensive. As a result, July rose by 4 points, August rose by 6 points, and September rose by 7 points. The spot wheat market is still quite stable. Due to good sales of spot flour, the amount in stock is not very large, and the market price is stable. Kaishan Dongguide wheat is 4 yuan, and Luohe Xiping wheat is 3 yuan 97 cents. 500 bags were sold by Xinda, 1,000 bags by Fufeng, and 400 bags by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Overseas Chicago was closed on Friday, and foreign countries were closed for several days, so the selling wind must be strong. The situation in the southwest has not changed, and it is rumored that the early zone is gradually expanding.</p>

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from each gang was still only more than twenty numbers (the goods were nearly 4,000 piculs. This is because people's sentiment is bullish, and the market was tight from the beginning. Later, gangs from Baowei, Qingdao, and Yantai handled nearly 1,000 packages. The street also moved, and the market color gradually rose. The passenger's intention was noted, and the goods were raised differently. Until the closing, if Suzhou and Tong's early rice increased by jiao [10 cents] stones [unit of measure], Nanhang's early rice increased by 2 jiao, and each late rice rose by 1 or 2 jiao. If the shipment continues to be scarce in the future, there is hope for an increase. Original silver goods are also rare and rise by 2 or 3 jiao accordingly.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were only thirteen or fourteen numbers from the river. Each commodity in the market goes to the stomach, white glutinous rice is active, early is thin and neat, white silver continues to melt, and the rest also moves. Market price, white glutinous rice plus one or two jiao, thin rice rose sharply by three or four jiao due to scarce goods, early rice and white silver also rose by two jiao, and the rest also increased.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Foreign Customers and Early Rice Each Rise by 1 Jiao, 34,000 Packages Opened Throughout the Day <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign rice were very active for customers. In addition to the continued smooth handling in the mainland, there were also receptions in Jiujiang, Nanjing, Ningbo, and this street. Also, because the market price abroad rose, people's sentiment on the market was also optimistic, and hoarders insisted more forcefully. Only 250 tons of return futures were traded. 34,000 packages of spot foreign rice were opened. About 2,000 packages of early rice were also opened. Most of them were still going to the mainland, and the price was about 1 jiao higher than the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was slightly active. Because the factories had bean cake sales, the bean stomach was moved. The rest of this street, the mainland, and Tongzhou were also able to transfer and connect, and the market atmosphere improved. Yesterday, a total of 5,000 packages of Guidet beans were opened, priced at 3 yuan 85 jiao. Yingzhou three cars, also 3 yuan 75 jiao and 7 jiao. Bengbu beans two cars, priced at 3 yuan 45 jiao and 4 jiao. Quanhe beans two cars, priced at 38 jiao and 7 jiao 5. Haozhou beans one car, priced at 3 yuan 6 jiao 7. Zhengyangguan beans one car, priced at 3 yuan 5 jiao 7. Xuzhou beans more than 200 packages, priced at 3 yuan 7 jiao 4. Hankou Zhazha beans more than 700 packages, priced from 3 yuan 8 jiao 1 to 7 jiao 4. Hankou late beans more than 300 packages, priced at 3 yuan 5 jiao 5 and 4 jiao 3.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the bran market was loose and falling again. Foreign dealers were not moving, and the sales in the mainland were very quiet. In addition, the goods in the hands of brokers were all thinking of selling quickly, so the asking price was loose and chaotic, with a tendency to fall sharply. It was heard that the asking price of each stall had dropped to 2 yuan 378 fen, a drop of nearly jiao [10 cents] compared to the beginning of the week.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Dumping, Chinese Silk Exports to Europe Greatly Reduced <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Japanese silk is well known for its good quality, hard work in promoting sales, so it is familiar and clear about the situation in the world's raw silk market. Recently, the new silk has been on the market, and the time is near, and the inventory is not much, so the price is too high. The Yokohama market recently had a maximum of 647 yuan for spot goods. Unexpectedly, the US market saw its hidden prices and fell sharply, from a maximum of 1.38 yuan to only 1.325 yuan yesterday (the 18th), so the opening in Yokohama yesterday has returned to 612 yuan. Japan's overseas exports of silk in March were the highest record in recent years, with a total of 45,313 packages, valued at 28,546,500 Japanese yen, an increase of 7,338 packages and an increase in value of 3,986,060 yuan compared to February. It was found that the total amount of Chinese silk exported last month was 993 packages, accounting for only 2.18% of it.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Silver Prices High, Chinese Tea Foreign Sales Plunge <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the foreign tea market has been extremely sluggish. Dealers in England and France have been reluctant to buy existing goods on the market due to repeated increases in silver prices abroad, unless there is a demand from future telegrams. The market presents a plunging appearance. It was found that the current exchange rate between England and France is 20 to 30% higher than at the same time last year, and the tea price in Shanghai is implicitly reduced by 20 to 30 yuan per 100 yuan. In the autumn when new tea is launched, tea merchants from all over the world should reduce costs based on the principle of cost reduction, so as not to cause problems.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Oil Market: It's Peak Season, Asphalt May Be Difficult to Hope for Cheaply <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>The peak season for asphalt sales is just around the corner, because soap factories making soap and candle factories attacking candles are the only raw materials. The two are used in the market, especially soap making. However, the oil used in soap making only seeks cheap prices and specializes in inferior goods, while candle making does not. It is necessary to choose high-quality products and not dislike high prices, so the uses of the two are different. Tracing back to the past, due to the high price of Japanese wax, most soap factories have switched to using coconut oil, tallow, etc. as substitutes, which inevitably reduces the color of soap made with asphalt. However, the asphalt-producing areas in Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces have happened to have lean years, and the output has been greatly reduced. Therefore, although the soap is clear, there is no surplus accumulation in various producing areas. This spring, the active savings in the Han market are thin, and the sales are not very strong. Moreover, Zhejiang Province is also one of the asphalt-producing areas, and the drought last year was particularly severe. Although the year is owed, the sales field is even more owed. Most of the oil produced must be dumped to other provinces, so the market cannot be based on the Han market as usual and reduce prices on its own. In the past month, the Han market has not risen or fallen, but the Zhejiang road has fallen by about two yuan. This is because it has to reduce prices to seek distant sales in order to clear sales locally. Recently, Hanzhong and Jingmen still need 14 taels and 68 qian, Tianjin heavy 14 taels, and Macheng 14 taels and 2 qian. Because this port is close to Zhejiang Province, the sales market has been separated from the Han market for a long time. However, it will inevitably lose money if you buy it from the Han market, so those who purchase from the Han market have gradually become obsolete. Therefore, what the local dealers rely on is the Jingchi directly loaded from Yichang, which is cheaper than the Han market. However, the high and low grades of the loan products are different, so the selling price of the same Chongjing is more than two yuan higher or lower. The changes in production have reached their extreme. What can maintain the original state is only the local vehicle asphalt in Jiaxing, Western Zhejiang. It has been the same for decades and has never been high or low. Therefore, the oil sold in this port this spring seems to be more than in previous years, and it is specifically used to attack candles, because its goods are indeed welcomed by candle manufacturers, and its sales field is also increasing year by year. A month ago, it was sold for 26 yuan per load. Recently, it has fallen to 24 yuan. It is said that the active savings in the producing area are thin and there is no hope for a lower price.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Miscellaneous Discussions on Humor <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>The prevalence of "humor movements" can be described as "unparalleled" in the history of Chinese cultural movements. However, if we puncture this paper tiger, we find nothing inside. Some use false humor to feign superiority, making trivial and harmless satirical remarks to gain applause; others use humor to express their feelings and sentiments, like "hiding bitterness in bitter tea," sitting on a sofa, smoking a cigarette, sipping fragrant tea, smacking their lips, sighing with an air of "leisure," then opening a 20th-century joke book, saying a few "relaxed," half-witty and half-serious words, eliciting "knowing smiles" from everyone. Thus, "humor," "humor," eventually even the clown's antics on stage are brought in to add to the collection.</p>
<p>However, it would be a great mistake to say that the humor movement is merely a tool for ambitious people to climb the ladder, "irrelevant to the fate of the nation." The reason why the humor movement became so popular is not solely due to the promoters, but also has its objective social basis. Many people are dissatisfied with reality, so they use "jesting without malice" to satirize the objects they hate, which becomes the only way to vent their anger and resentment. From this, we can say that the emergence of the humor movement is not accidental, but has its rational reasons for existence. Thorough and fierce laughter is necessary, and a gentle, non-satirical sneer is also needed. "Humor is a wonderfully effective corrector. Therefore, humorous comedy is a gentle satirical comedy that points out shortcomings and teaches how to remove them—it is a mirror placed before people, not a mirror that makes them panic and want to find ropes or nails upon seeing it, but a mirror that makes them feel the need to wash their face and shave."</p>
<p>The function and power of humor are evident here. It is true that humor is "not thorough enough to expose reality." However, it is not necessarily the case that "it often turns the public's determination to fight into a wisp of smoke" or "turns the butcher's ferocity into a lighthearted smile." If that is really the case, it is the fault of "humor," not the fault of the humor movement. The problem lies in how to remove those glib, witty, and slapstick elements, "knowing smiles," "expected reversals," etc., from humor, and transform it into a tool to educate the general public, make them aware of the ugliness of reality, and make them feel the need to tell it (reality) to wash its face and shave. Although humor is "not thorough enough to expose reality," it can still expose reality (though not "thoroughly"). By satirically exposing certain aspects of the dark side of reality, even if it cannot "comprehensively" expose it and give us a way out, it has fulfilled its task and function by helping the general public recognize the aspects of reality and making them feel the need to reform it.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Accepting Criticism and Scolding <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yifan</p>
<p>In a recent issue of "Free Talk," Mr. Tang Tao published an article entitled "Accepting Criticism," in which he discussed the issue of accepting criticism and scolding. I think this is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>In the section where Mr. Tang Tao addressed this issue, he said:</p>
<p>"But now it is said that even truth is crying in pain, because critics have scolded everything to the ground.</p>
<p>"In fact, there are different kinds of scolding. Careless scolding that starts with 'damn it' is certainly unacceptable; but scathing scolding that can pinpoint the flaws and enumerate them in detail can still be accepted."</p>
<p>I don't know if the "now it is said that even truth is crying in pain" referred to here is really "because critics have scolded everything to the ground." I don't want to delve into it too deeply, because Mr. Tang's article has already answered it. And Mr. Tang Tao's opinion is the opposite. So when he talked about scolding, he conceded again and again and said, "In fact, there are different kinds of scolding." Then he pointed out that there are "unacceptable" "careless scolding" and "scathing scolding that can pinpoint the flaws and enumerate them in detail" in criticism, which "can still be accepted."</p>
<p>He feels that the alleged truth is crying in pain, which is really impossible to completely write off the critics, because he believes that critics "are also human beings" and "they understand other people's works."</p>
<p>I agree with Mr. Tang Tao's statement, but I still want to add some opinions.</p>
<p>In fact, to talk about the issue of accepting criticism is a matter of contending for truth. The attitude of critics needs to be serious and objective, and they cannot simply resort to careless scolding or dogmatism, so as to arouse the antipathy of the criticized—the writers, or even "ignore it." This seems to be unnecessary to say a second time, everyone understands. But even if you do this, as Mr. Tang Tao said, can "scathing scolding that can pinpoint the flaws and enumerate them in detail" really "still be able to" ask people—those criticized writers—to humbly "accept" it?</p>
<p>Nothing is clearer than what Mr. Tang Tao himself said! Because those writers had already "ignored it all together, and, 'as usual, there are always a few words to say. Or they say: "This is a Taiwanese!" Or they say: "This is a certain faction!" And the more thorough one is: "Hey! You're pointing at your own nose!" They are "denouncing criticism" and "resisting criticism!"'"</p>
<p>No matter how well-intentioned and objective a critic you are, what can you do with these people?</p>
<p>Here, we have to come into contact with the writer's subjective understanding and the writer's own artistic cultivation. If we really want to talk about criticism and accepting criticism.</p>
<p>For a writer who has long been despaired of, or, in other words, whose understanding has completely turned backwards, even if there is criticism that "can still be accepted"—"scathing scolding that can pinpoint the flaws and enumerate them in detail"—the critic is completely useless to him; because he has already said to you: "Hey! You are Taiwanese! You are a certain faction! You are pointing at your own nose." Can you still talk to him about accepting criticism? No matter how different your scolding is, before your civilized scathing scolding even begins, he has already "ignored it all together," or even become embarrassed and angry, "spitting blood on people." This has become his consistent attitude. At this time, can you have a better way to accommodate him than to ruthlessly expose his true colors in the open air, so that he can humbly accept criticism again?</p>
<p>Well-intentioned criticism with theoretical basis can have a critical effect on a criticized—a writer—only if the person's understanding is vague, or his worldview is certain but his artistic cultivation is not enough. It is possible to expect such a person to humbly accept criticism. If a critic can grasp their weaknesses, then at this time, you can bluntly say to him: "You can't be so lazy and opportunistic!" Or say: "This is not the way, you've gotten into a dead end!" Or even say: "You're doing the enemy's work!" No matter how you enumerate and scold, he will not refuse you, as long as the critic's own attitude is sincere and serious. And this scathing scolding is no longer scolding, but has become guidance, correction, and encouragement. A writer who has his own correct worldview or is willing to improve, will not only "still be able to accept" such scathing scolding criticism, but will definitely be willing to accept it from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>But at the same time, don't forget the critic himself: what Mushanokoji Saneatsu said: Critics "are also human beings," is true: saying that they "will not fundamentally understand other people's works" is a big mistake. But it is not necessarily true to believe that every critic can "understand other people's works." Why? Because among critics, there are critics who only know how to scold carelessly, and there are even critics who are full of poisonous sores. Can you pay attention to such critics' arbitrary scolding and biting, and nonsense? In this situation, the enlightened writer's response to this "absolutely absurd critic" is no longer "accepting criticism," but must be a head-on blow (!). Therefore, there needs to be a sound "critic" of critics who stubbornly seek the truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, my opinion is: when it comes to criticism and "accepting criticism," in fact, there are different kinds of scolding. Careless scolding is certainly unacceptable; but in theory, "scathing scolding that can pinpoint the flaws and enumerate them in detail" may "still be able to be accepted," but in fact, it still depends on what kind of critic it is, and what kind of) writer is being criticized.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Yellow Fur Peak <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Qi</p>
<p>The name of the mountain peak is "Yellow Fur Peak."</p>
<p>How many feet above sea level is Yellow Fur Peak? No surveying team has ever been there, so it's not very clear. However, according to the reprinted Japanese military maps, it is drawn with dense black lines in layers. We climbed this Yellow Fur Peak, looking up for three whole days.</p>
<p>On the third day, we climbed to the top of Yellow Fur Peak, and saw that the surrounding mountains had all lowered their heads. Higher than this mountain peak was only our "Old Heaven." However, sometimes Old Heaven also lowered its head, scattering clouds and mist, and kissing the mountain peak, or putting a hat on the mountain peak.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Yellow Fur Peak, we quickly set up our tents and prepared to live there for three days. If we didn't see any signs of bandits within three days, then we would consider our information inaccurate and move on to the next mountain. In any case, in these two weeks, we had to search in the mountains, because the order specified that this group of people should be searched for in the mountains.</p>
<p>It was spring, and green grass was growing on the mountain peak. The sun was very warm, and the brothers wearing cotton military uniforms were sweating profusely. Because they couldn't sweat comfortably, some of them pulled out the cotton padding from their military uniforms to use as toilet paper, using the cotton as toilet paper. The coolies, seeing that they hadn't been carrying loads for several days in a row, looked at the sky and thought of home in their spare time. The radio's charging machine was "clapping" on the hillside. There were many radio waves in the sky, and the person with the earphones clipped to his ears was looking for his own signal in the radio waves. Sometimes, they even heard a song from Shanghai or Little Luzon… The days passed peacefully for two days.</p>
<p>But an unexpected thing happened on the evening of the second day. Because everyone was already sleeping in their tents, only the sentries knew about it at first.</p>
<p>It was a sky with a big moon, but after midnight, clouds began to gather. The clouds became denser and thicker, and finally obscured the moon. From the corner of the sky, a storm came sweeping in. In a few minutes, the storm was raging wildly. Finally, it blew the raindrops down from the clouds. At first, it was small, but it became bigger and bigger. At this time, a roar arose in the mountains. "Whump—whump—," like countless people rushing, shouting. "Snap," the radio's antenna pole broke, "whump," the tent was blown away, followed by the miserable cries of a group of people drenched in the rain. The coolies, covered with a few stalks of straw, ran wildly in the dark mountains in a panic. The commanding officer, flustered, got up to check the sentries. The wind was blowing harder and harder. The rain was falling harder and harder. The climate changed drastically into winter. The raindrops immediately turned into freezing rain. Before long, the sentries fell, the coolies fell, the mules and horses fell, and clothes and boxes were washed down the mountain by the mountain torrents… The wind and rain became even greater. At this time, Yellow Fur Peak was a scene of turmoil and misery.</p>
<p>The next morning, suddenly, the wind and rain stopped. Someone clever, in the middle of the night, had paved the ground with thick glass. The branches, the green grass, the coolies' faces, the gun barrels, were all inlaid with glass. The beards, the long hair, the mules' and horses' tails, the tassels tied to the ends of the guns, were all hung with glass wind chimes. The tents that hadn't been blown away were frozen solid, and the eyebrows and hair of the living people had all turned white. The bugler blew the assembly call, but they had to assemble and go down the mountain, but the bugler couldn't blow the bugle. The bugle was completely filled with ice… The top of the mountain was still a scene of turmoil and misery.</p>
<p>"Go down the mountain, go down the mountain, if we don't go down the mountain, we'll die."</p>
<p>The group could no longer resist the cold. Coerced by the power of nature, they could only go down the mountain. But all the things were frozen solid and could no longer be taken away. Some people slipped on the slope and were smashed to pieces on the steep cliffs below.</p>
<p>When going down the mountain, it was still a scene of turmoil and misery.</p>
<p>After walking down the slope for more than a dozen miles, as if by magic, the red sun reappeared, shining on our soaked clothes, and the sky was clear. We knew that Old Heaven was playing a joke on us. But when we looked back at the mountain peak, the mountain peak was in the clouds and mist, and we really couldn't tell whether we were awake or dreaming.</p>
<p>But what about the people left on the mountain peak? They sacrificed themselves before they even encountered the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Notes on Examining the Exhibits of the Chinese Art International Exhibition (3) <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Rooms four and five display porcelain from the Song and Ming dynasties onward, totaling 314 pieces. In this era of decline of Chinese porcelain, looking at the exquisite products of the Northern Song Dynasty's Ding Kiln, Jun Kiln, Ru Kiln, Official Kiln, Longquan Kiln, Ge Kiln, Jianyang Kiln, and various other kilns, and then looking at the progress in color and style of the Southern Song Dynasty, Jizhou Kiln, Ming Yongle Kiln, and Xuande Kiln, one cannot help but sigh at the aging of the nation, which is already evident in the production of these daily necessities. Jingdezhen Kiln, since ancient times, has combined the advantages of various kilns, and the utensils made are all-encompassing, but now everything is not as good as before. Perhaps the glory of Chinese porcelain will end together with Jingdezhen! There are many people at the exhibition who, after seeing the , from the early Qing Dynasty, Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong reigns, not only are the bright reds moving, but the sky blues, yellows, and blown purples are even more vivid, and they praised them one after another. But their everyday household eating utensils are either Japanese or Western, and they have almost forgotten the products of Jingdezhen!</p>
<p>Room six displays ancient books, jade artifacts, cloisonné enamel, carved lacquer, and selected examples of archaeological items, etc. The ancient books section has not yet arrived completely. There are carved editions from the Southern Song, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties, mainly carved editions. I have already praised the compiler's insight in my previous article. The Sino-Barbarian Dictionary, an official carved edition from the Hongwu reign, is carved with extreme precision. In addition to the carved editions, there are two manuscript copies of the Legend of the Moon-Worshipping Pavilion and the Legend of the Spiritual Treasure Sword, which are truly exquisite and lovely. Living in this circle of crude and shoddy Shanghai-style crafts, seeing these fine products of the handicraft era, one cannot help but sigh that people of ancient and modern times are incomparable. I have never had any particular fondness for jade artifacts. Apart from the value of the objects themselves, they have no significant meaning in cultural history. Many ladies are very enthusiastic about them, wishing they could break the glass and compare the jade artifacts in the cabinet with the jade bracelets on their arms. Several jade artifacts from the Qianlong reign are carved with extreme precision, which further attracts the ladies' affections. The archaeological items group, such as stone axes, stone knives, bone arrowheads, bone hairpins, bronze ge, bronze spears, etc., many have already been seen in the Anyang excavation reports and in books such as The Dawn of Eastern Culture. Seeing the actual objects naturally makes one feel more interested. As far as I know, the achievements of the Academia Sinica in excavating in Henan and the scope of their research are much broader than this. We hope that in the future, Henan will become the Pompeii of the East.</p>
<p>Of course, I should declare my own position: I am looking at that exhibition with the significance of studying ancient Chinese culture. Perhaps many words have offended the dignity of artists and antique collectors. Forgive me! Forgive me! (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e256">Mr. Juqing (17) <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Then the test question was brought up. What Mr. Juqing wanted to ask Principal Zhang was the meaning of the four characters "stubborn and ignorant."</p>
<p>Principal Zhang did not answer the test question. His face changed color in waves, and every vein stood out on his temples. He slammed the table and cursed loudly, and finally got into a twisted brawl with Mr. Juqing. Mr. Juqing was pushed and shoved to the street, and then twisted towards the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>The quiet small street was rippled with excitement, and there were as many people watching the fun as there were watching a race.</p>
<p>Principal Zhang and Mr. Juqing were twisting and wrestling in the front, surrounded by the lanky man and the teacher with the neck hair; Mr. Juqing's dozen or so students followed behind, and there were also many men and women onlookers, like a group of tadpoles in a spring pond, crowding and squeezing in the street.</p>
<p>"Look, Principal Zhang wrote the wrong character!"</p>
<p>All the way, Mr. Shi Qing shouted loudly with a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Principal Zhang wrote the wrong character, what a disgrace!"</p>
<p>But after arriving at the Public Security Bureau, Mr. Juqing didn't even have a chance to say a few words. They didn't even need to ask who was right and who was wrong. They just let Principal Zhang passionately explain everything to the patrol captain, and Mr. Juqing was arrested.</p>
<p>Mrs. Juqing, in a frenzy, ran crying and sobbing through the streets, and almost ran through the homes of several gentlemen in the town.</p>
<p>She kowtowed to everyone she met, with tears and snot, begging them to rescue her husband. She had experienced so many tragic encounters in her life, but had never run into such a disaster; terror and anxiety dominated her central nervous system, and she became like someone who had completely lost consciousness.</p>
<p>It wasn't until after dusk that she got a business card from Chu Runfu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. When Mr. Juqing came out of the detention center of the Public Security Bureau, it was already 11 o'clock at night, and everyone in the town was asleep.</p>
<p>After returning home, Mr. Juqing didn't say a word from beginning to end. His eyes were even more deeply sunken in, emitting a shimmering light; his face was as expressionless as if it were cast in iron. When asked if he wanted to drink tea, he didn't say a word; when told to rest, he didn't say a word. All were silent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the silence, he roared fiercely, his voice shrill and high-pitched:</p>
<p>"What law did I break to be detained!"</p>
<p>He punched the table, and the Mei Foo oil lamp suddenly jumped up, and the light dimmed and flickered as if it were about to go out. Mrs. Juqing and her daughter-in-law were horrified beside her, shivering in waves.</p>
<p>"I don't want this old life anymore, I'll fight you!"</p>
<p>Bang! Another punch. He stood up to rush out, but was pulled back by his mother and daughter-in-law, and pressed back into the chair.</p>
<p>He sat down weakly, feeling an overwhelming fatigue all over his body.</p>
<p>What would happen next? This study, this lonely, gray home? This insult that swept away all dignity?…</p>
<p>In a daze, he saw hundreds of snobbish eyes shooting at him like random arrows, and hundreds of mocking faces demonstrating against him. Thousands and hundreds of golden stars were dancing wildly before his eyes, and a huge dark cloud was quickly pressing down on his forehead.</p>
<p>His body suddenly fell from the chair to the ground, and he knew nothing. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e257">Students Attend National Goods Pledge Ceremony <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>This year is the student national goods year, and yesterday was the day for students to take an oath to use national goods. From now on, students will bear the two major missions of using national goods themselves and persuading relatives and friends to use national goods. This kind of responsibility is inherently unshoulderable and obligatory.</p>
<p>But to persuade others to use national goods, one must first use national goods oneself. This goes without saying, otherwise one cannot even open one's mouth. The student national goods year does not mean that students should use national goods, but non-students do not necessarily have to use national goods, nor does it mean that students should use national goods, but should not use national goods as soon as they leave school. This meaning should be understood by everyone. In my opinion, students, especially university students, should use national goods even more, because the common problem of university students is that as soon as they become university students, they become arrogant and speak of foreign things, speak of foreign things all the time - not to mention those who have studied abroad - they regard national goods as worthless weeds. If they are not wearing Western suits and leather shoes, they seem to lose the dignity and personality of a university student. A kind of contempt for national goods is naturally deeply planted in their hearts. Therefore, middle school students admire the airs of university students and often wear Western suits and leather shoes, and all their products are imported goods. The formation of this kind of psychology, fundamentally speaking, is more than enough to destroy the country and exterminate the species.</p>
<p>Because university students are the role models for middle school students, and middle school students are the role models for elementary school students, if university students can develop the habit of using national goods, then the habits of middle and elementary school students will also be easily developed. As for using national goods, it is originally the national duty of every citizen. Whether our country's national and social economy has reached the end of its rope, we should not fail to use national goods, even if the national and social economy is relatively abundant, we should also use national goods, because abandoning national goods and using foreign goods will inevitably result in a day when we reach the end of our rope.</p>
<p>Today, I want to say that not only students, but I also urge the rich to use national goods, which is even more important than those who are relatively poor, because wealthy families spend thousands of taels on a car, and dozens of yuan on a sofa, while poor families, even if they want to use non-national goods, do not have the purchasing power. Therefore, it is more important for the rich to use national goods than for the poor. I also urge businessmen to use national goods, and non-businessmen should pay even more attention to using national goods, because ordinary people have an extremely weak ability to distinguish between national goods and non-national goods, and there are generally unscrupulous merchants who only seek profit and often pass off non-national goods as national goods, mixing fish eyes with pearls everywhere. Such merchants should also wake up early and thoroughly reform themselves. Not only will they avoid the warnings of bystanders, but they will also be condemned by their own conscience, which they may never forget.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Tonghui Silk Shop <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>When the first fish vendor passed through the central market, four or five craftsmen from Tonghui Silk Shop were on high ladders, decorating a grand sale archway with colorful green cloth. Manager Mr. Zhou, like a monkey, jumped from the shop to the street and back, helping to organize the fabrics. Tiny beads of sweat dotted his forehead, and his wrinkled yellow face shone as if it were a newly sculpted Buddha statue, every cell radiating with hope. This was the first time the fish</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>vendor's second brother had seen Mr. Zhou so energized since the beginning of spring.</p>
<p>Tonghui Silk Shop is the oldest brand name in the whole county. Everyone clearly remembers the gilded characters on the two plaques hanging on either side of the entrance. The shop was founded in the twelfth year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign, specializing in purchasing various provincial silks and satins. However, the gilt is now peeling, and the underlying mud is exposed on the wooden boards. Yet, Manager Mr. Zhou takes pride in this, believing that a brand-name shop should have such ancient gilded plaques!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou started as an apprentice and only rose to the position of manager after the first revolution. He has seen and learned much, and his primary creed is that business should be conducted with harmony to generate wealth. Apprentices must not deviate from the rules, and he himself was favored by the shop owner and promoted to his current position because of this. Every day after closing, during dinner, he would drink wine and recount his history of over a decade with the shop to the apprentices. He could remember the exact year and month of every event: the year he joined the shop, the year he was officially promoted to shop clerk, the year a certain apprentice was dismissed for being slow to serve a customer. He would solemnly recount these stories in detail every day, never mixing up the order or accidentally omitting anything. Therefore, since he took over, he has monopolized the business of all the wealthy families in the county. He frequented the homes of local gentry and dignitaries, appearing to be a very important person. When a family was marrying off a daughter or taking a bride, he would immediately bring the latest styles of goods to their door for them to choose from, and his prices were fairer than those of his competitors. Tonghui Silk Shop's reputation grew year by year, while the characters on the two plaques of the brand-name shop became almost unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Many silk and satin shops opened in the eastern and western markets, but none could surpass Tonghui. In terms of goods, service, and prices, no one could match Mr. Zhou's business acumen. When people spoke of the silk and satin industry in the county, they only mentioned our Mr. Zhou's Tonghui Silk Shop.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou is now over fifty years old. One could say that he has lived his life for Tonghui Silk Shop. He gets up early and goes to bed late, just like when he was an apprentice, except for the few glasses of old wine he drinks at dinner. However...</p>
<p>The ghost-like county bus station suddenly opened long-distance bus routes. The road, built with funds raised from various shops, brought an irreparable and fatal blow. The sudden change in fashion throughout the county was a strange phenomenon. Western-style clothing often flashed before Mr. Zhou's eyes in front of Tonghui Silk Shop, and women's dresses were especially eye-catching, like colorful butterflies. Tonghui Silk Shop, which prided itself on being a brand-name store, suddenly saw its latest silk and satin colors dim in comparison. It barely made any sales each day, while expenses increased in reverse proportion. This long-distance bus route brought a continuous stream of taxes and levies with names that were difficult to pronounce. Seeing this ominous phenomenon, Mr. Zhou resigned from his position to the shop owner almost daily.</p>
<p>Bao Kang and Xiang Tai in the eastern and western markets have successively closed down. Several silk and satin businesses, struggling to take their last breath, had to imitate the Western-style sales of the other end of the long-distance bus route, erecting colorful archways and holding grand sales with the sound of Western drums pounding all day long. When Mr. Zhou learned of this, he shook his head and sighed even more. No business was coming in, and now they had to add these extravagant expenses. "It's truly self-inflicted!" he exclaimed when the apprentices told him that a certain shop was holding a grand sale. But the second piece of news arrived: Sheng Fuzhuang and Qian Dahao were crowded with people, and they could make half a thousand in sales each day. Mr. Zhou was astonished by this contradictory situation and realized the method of raising prices. He was tormented by the words "unorthodox," so he stopped drinking wine at dinner and quickly ate his meal to discuss with the shop owner whether this method could be implemented.</p>
<p>Finally, on this morning, a colorful archway was erected in front of Tonghui Silk Shop. This was Mr. Zhou's final decision. "If business doesn't improve," he said, "I'm quitting. I haven't seen such a market in decades!"</p>
<h3 id="e259">Memories of Rain <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ni</p>
<p>Waking up early and pushing open the south-facing glass window, I felt a little unhappy. The plum rain was still falling, drizzling like silk threads, weaving into a crystal-like curtain hanging in front of the window.</p>
<p>The sky was piled with gray clouds, layer upon layer, densely frozen, making the sky gloomy and low, as if it were collapsing on people's heads. In the distance, a patch of jungle newly dressed in tender green clothes was obscured by the misty rain, like a thin veil. The winding path of the field ridge from the village entrance to the county town was already muddy, and several villagers silently held up their rain gear and walked along laboriously. The dirty water and soybean-milk-like mud in the small puddles splashed all over their clothes.</p>
<p>"Annoying plum rain season, it's truly suffocating!" I sighed deeply, murmuring in my heart.</p>
<p>Rain, in itself, is very closely related to me. But I like the surging, torrential rain and the gurgling, pouring incessant rain, and I don't like this drizzling, silky, hair-like plum rain of Jiangnan. However, this stampeding torrential rain is something I can enjoy contentedly very few times each year in Jiangnan. When the plum rain falls every year, it always confines me to a narrow room that is too small to turn around in, silently worrying, facing the morbid rain outside the window, and reminiscing about the unrestrained, surging rain of the South—Siam.</p>
<p>At that time, I was staying in the South, and it was then that I deeply understood the elegant taste of rain and formed an extremely fond connection with rain.</p>
<p>In the hot tropics of the South, there is also a rainy season every year, lasting for a long one or two months, just like the plum rain season in Jiangnan. But it is not like the plum rain in Jiangnan, which flutters silkily all day long, making people's emotions feel overly sad and melancholic! When the rain has not yet fallen, the sky is as blue as the blue sea, and the sun fiercely emits heat, scorching people's heads and backs with all its might. No one would believe that this beautiful, clear sky would bring a torrential rain in two or three quarters of an hour! However, at this very moment, this clear, beautiful blue sky changes color. Black clouds stretch out from the corners of the horizon and quickly fill the entire sky. The sun also retracts its heat and escapes into the gaps in the clouds. The wind blows madly, getting stronger and stronger, shaking the lush green trees in the fields, making them roar like a tiger, creating the atmosphere of "the mountain rain is about to come." Then comes the torrential downpour, pattering crisply on the roofs of the attap houses. How clear and lovely this sound is, how poetic! At this time, if you wake up from a nap and listen to the crisp sound on the roof, you will be reminded of the poetic scene of listening quietly to the "sound of rain breaking the lotus sound" by the lotus pond at night.</p>
<p>After an hour or two, the wind and rain completely stop. The clouds clear, and the sky is bright. The sun is still embedded in the jade-like blue sky, peeking at people with a charming smile. At this time, everything on the earth appears extraordinarily fresh and peaceful. Then you drag your wooden clogs and walk alone to the suburbs, to the river to listen quietly to the gurgling water and to admire the crystal-clear water droplets on the lush green leaves, shining with golden light under the sunlight. At this time, you forget the heat of the weather in the South, and your heart will naturally feel infinitely pleasant and comfortable!</p>
<p>Every time I look at the annoying plum rain outside the window, it always makes me miss the pleasant rainy season in the South. However, the overseas Chinese, under multiple oppressions, have lost their past glory, and the world is no longer theirs!</p>
<p>This surging torrential rain of the South will henceforth be eternally buried in the depths of my heart!</p>
<h3 id="e260">Burial <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>Past life leaves only faint shadows on memory, like faded ancient paintings.</p>
<p>The faint shadows on these faded paintings are not shadows of people, flowers, or the moon, but rather shadows of smiles and traces of tears.</p>
<p>When people climb to the highest peak (whether it is the peak of happiness or the peak of pain), they always like to look back at the path where they have left their footprints. At this moment, as I am about to fall to the other side of life's peak, let me also look at the shadows of smiles and traces of tears left behind.</p>
<p>…In the hall, under the eaves, hung brilliant gauze lanterns. Candlelight shone through the red gauze, illuminating the hall full of banquets, the painting of the three stars in the center of the hall, the congratulatory screens with red background and golden characters on both sides, the bright red pillar couplets, and the bright red report card above the three stars, revealing the flat black characters on the report card: Your son ××× has completed his studies at this elementary school and passed the examination with satisfactory results and is hereby granted graduation…</p>
<p>"Congratulations, congratulations, in a few years he will be a foreign scholar!"</p>
<p>The short, stout father led his son, dressed in a new robe and jacket, into the hall, and all the red-faced guests in the hall stood up together.</p>
<p>…In a small thatched cottage in the green shade of the park. Ying and I held the poetry collection Golden Treasure and hummed famous love poems. The breeze blew the soft willow branches, rustling like whispers, like sighs. Sunlight passed through the gaps in the dense shade and fell on the rockery beside the pavilion, sometimes slipping here, sometimes slipping there, as if secretly watching our behavior and eavesdropping on our secrets.</p>
<p>"Ying, look! This sunlight is like a secret agent jointly dispatched by your father and my mother, spying on our actions."</p>
<p>"You are truly a cowardly animal, always associating everything with family obstacles. Have you forgotten the Shakespearean lines we just read? Love can penetrate rocks?"</p>
<p>"Can our love also penetrate rocks?"</p>
<p>"The question lies with you!"</p>
<p>Turning my face, my eyes met hers. One head slowly lowered, and the other followed closer.</p>
<p>…The sky was densely covered with hazy rain curtains, and the ground was dotted with small puddles. In the twilight of dusk, Ying and I were walking hurriedly.</p>
<p>"Are you really leaving me? Not caring about our two years of cohabitation?"</p>
<p>"It's not that I want to leave you, it's that life wants me to leave you."</p>
<p>"Can't life be changed?"</p>
<p>"Precisely because I want to change life, I am leaving you."</p>
<p>"Can't we change it together?"</p>
<p>"No. You want to drag me from the line of hunger to the line of death."</p>
<p>"Is there absolutely no way to save it? This is my last cry."</p>
<p>"No, this is the result of my half-year of consideration."</p>
<p>Stopping, watching Ying's shadow gradually disappear into the haze. … Dreaming, I returned to the pigeon-cage-like pavilion, took out my diploma from the bottom of the box, and tore it into countless small butterflies, scattering them on the floor.</p>
<p>…Inside the iron gate, the unique stench of the chicken coop.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and immersed myself in meditation, thinking about life and death.</p>
<p>The iron gate clanged. My heart jumped. I opened my eyes. A hand handed me a Quaker bread wrapped in transparent white paper. "A woman sent it to you."</p>
<p>Taking it, I looked at it. On the white paper was a small square of white newspaper, which wrote: "I wish you good health! Ying."</p>
<p>In five minutes, I relived the past three years of my life. The corners of my eyes were a little wet.</p>
<p>Faint shadows of smiles and traces of tears! From now on, I will bury you in oblivion.</p>
<p>News Mr. Cui Wanqiu, after writing "New Road" and "Portraits of Women," has recently compiled his short stories from the years 1929 to 1934 and self-published a book titled "Red Dot," which includes ten stories: Duoga Zi, Red Dot, An Qi Sees It Disappear, The Drunkard's Intention, One Night at the Ballroom, The Cherry Blossoms are Gone, Song of the Migratory Birds, Drifting, and Disappointment.

The last three stories tell of the sorrow of middle-aged intellectuals, which are even more desolate and bleak. The first page includes a photograph of Duoga Zi, making it even more valuable. It is said that the general distribution is now handled by the Times Bookstore Company.</p>

(You didn't think) of the crying child who has no one to rely on. (Poor me) with tearful eyes, to whom can I tell the thoughts in my heart? I want to remarry. My whole heart can't let go of this old home. Crying sadly until my intestines are about to break. Coughing and kneeling next to the grave.

<h3 id="e265">An Opinion for MGM after Garbo's "The Painted Veil" Failure <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Mizhen</p>
<p>Three months ago, a reporter from a major American newspaper predicted that Greta Garbo had reached a crossroads in her career. She had arrived at a very critical moment in her artistic life. Whether she could hold her position in the film industry would soon be revealed. If her "The Painted Veil" did not meet the expectations of the general American audience, she would have to take drastic measures to regain her original status.</p>
<p>Three months ago, the reporter also read the story of "The Painted Veil" and sighed for her. The story of "The Painted Veil" is based on the various threats and dangers encountered by white missionaries in Guangdong, China. It is indeed a film that insults our national identity and people. It depicts a severe epidemic raging in a certain county in Guangdong, with deaths all over the roads. Officials only knew how to pray to wooden puppets, and a large warehouse where the plague germs bred was not allowed to be burned. The missionary doctor then sacrificed himself to burn the warehouse, which led to him being threatened by local officials and gentlemen and falling into various dangers. It was written as if China was still like the extremely dark Africa.</p>
<p>At that time, when I saw this movie story, I sighed deeply. There were many reasons for my sigh, and of course, it was not just for Greta Garbo. I also sighed for MGM, the largest film company in the United States. I sighed for the superficial knowledge of foreigners among Americans. I also sighed for the friendship between China and the United States. When will the endless stream of anti-China films made by the United States come to an end? When will their perception of us improve? Do they not know, or do they deliberately choose not to know?</p>
<p>In order to shoot a film that takes scenery from a foreign country, major American companies do not hesitate to send large teams of people to London or Dublin to collect eighteenth-century clothing, supplies, and even trivial things like menus and wine bottles, and bring them back to Hollywood to ensure the authenticity of the film's content. Can't they send one or two people with clear eyes to come to the Chinese mainland to see if there is a place with a dense population where such a severe epidemic is raging, with deaths all over the roads, and officials and gentlemen only know how to pray to wooden puppets, and not a single doctor appears?</p>
<p>Three months ago, I knew that this kind of film would not come to China. I thought that if it did, it would be like being "not afraid of death," and we could express ourselves. If it didn't come, we would feel that we had no way to express ourselves. As expected, it did not come. Not only did it not come to China, but it also failed greatly in the United States. In the "Modern Screen" rating table, among many five-star blockbusters, it only received three stars, while the lowest still had two stars. The reason why it had one more star than the worst film was probably because of Garbo's reputation.</p>
<p>To be honest, in China, apart from the residual effects of some American publicity and occasional translations published in Chinese film magazines, we have never really worshipped Garbo. What we loved to watch in the past were Janet Gaynor, Norma Shearer, Loretta Young, and now Claudette Colbert, Myrna Loy, Loretta Young, Maureen O'Sullivan, etc. Although Garbo had moving performances in films such as "Romance" and "Queen Christina," the flaws did not outweigh the merits. We, perhaps because of her widow-like face, never felt very enthusiastic about her.</p>
<p>The decline of a movie star is regrettable, but after acting in a film that insults our national identity and race, we are just human beings, and according to the nature of the human race, we should be happy about it. But what responsibility should MGM, the company that produced this "anti-China film," bear? MGM's products have a very wide market in China, and they have a resident representative in Shanghai. I hope they can use this article to promote the attention of their domestic company authorities. Otherwise, even if the films they produce are not necessarily shown in China, in our sincere search for friendship with neighboring countries, even if they do not come, we will know and arouse strong resentment.</p>

<h3 id="e266">Review of "Charlie Chan in Paris" <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Han</p>
<p>Charlie Chan in Paris</p>
<p>—— Grand Theater</p>
<p>There are really too many Charlie Chan cases. In those films, Warner Oland's portrayal of the Chinese detective consistently uses ungrammatical English and sluggish movements to provide laughter. This cannot be said to be intentionally insulting Chinese people, but it always feels inappropriate to put such a personality on an intelligent detective. However, I cannot deny that Warner Oland has performing intelligence. It is not easy for an American to dress up as a Chinese person and grasp the typical expressions so that Chinese people also find it very similar. Therefore, Warner Oland can take credit for Charlie Chan cases being able to arouse the interest of the audience in China. In "Charlie Chan in Paris," most of his performances are no different from before. Once, when he got into the car, he naturally pulled the edge of the hat a few times, which imitated the posture of an old Chinese man and was indeed a typical performance.</p>
<p>The content of "Charlie Chan in Paris" is similar to previous Charlie Chan detective films or other detective films. It is nothing more than shady people plotting to kill for money. After Charlie Chan's detective work, the evildoers are brought to justice. At the same time, there will be no shortage of love between young men and women. The difference is that it shows a bank manager forging government bonds. Those who commit crimes are people in the upper class. After the manager's mask is revealed, it cannot but make the "gentlemen" shudder.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the image being presented, people will not be very complimentary. Generally speaking, the director is old-fashioned in learning the unique techniques commonly used in detective films, and there is nothing particularly commendable. The atmosphere in a few scenes is still very tight, such as the various scenes in the cellar. However, people have seen too many of these films, so they do not feel very interested, although the film itself is not a failure.</p>

<h3 id="e267">Review of "The Little Minister" <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>“The Little Minister”</p>
<p>— Grand Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>In the tide of "literary and artistic films," in addition to Dickens, Barrie (Sir James Matthew Barrie) is also a writer regarded as a money tree by producers. Not long ago, "What Every Woman Knows" was shown in Nanjing, and here is another "The Little Minister."</p>
<p>Due to the translation and introduction of several stage plays, Barrie is no longer a completely unfamiliar figure in the Chinese theater scene. He was born in Kirriemuir, Scotland, in 1860. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh at the age of twenty-two, he began to write manuscripts. In 1889, he gained prominence with his novel "A Window in Thrums," which expressed the life of Scottish farmers with strong local color, rich humor, fantasy, and humanitarian sympathy. Subsequently, he produced many novels, among which "The Little Minister" became one of his masterpieces, establishing his position in the literary world.</p>
<p>Like Galsworthy, Barrie was a novelist and playwright. Shortly after the release of "The Little Minister," he began writing various scripts, and by 1922, he had written as many as thirty-five plays. Among the most important are "The Admirable Crichton," "Peter Pan," "What Every Woman Knows," "Twelve Pound Look," and Dear Brutus, which Mr. Hong Shen read as "Second Dream." "The Little Minister" was also adapted into a script in 1897.</p>
<p>Barrie's plays have been highly praised by some drama critics of similar types, such as Barrett H. Clark and William Lyon Phelps. It is said that he summarizes the characteristics of contemporary allegorical playwrights. He has Galsworthy's keen understanding, Jones's moral sincerity, John Synge's deep passion, Dunsany's outstanding fantasy, Irvine's ethical logic, Shaw's extraordinary wisdom, and Pinero's technique. Naturally, we must admit these characteristics of Barrie. But when we still want to find something in his plays, we will feel that something is missing. He does not have Galsworthy's sense of justice, Shaw's hatred of evil, or the unequal cries of Yeats and Lady Gregory. Except for "The Twelve Pound Look," which is slightly related to the issue of couples, at most, it only stops at the utopian etiquette in "The Admirable Crichton."</p>
<p>In "What Every Woman Knows," Barrie touches on the fact that the petty bourgeoisie is climbing upwards with capitalism, but he emphasizes the expression in their male-female relationship; in "The Little Minister," he also moves from the life of the weavers who were slaughtered by the soldiers of the villainous shopkeeper colluding with the landlord in the burgeoning textile industry and the old poor woman Langley who was driven away by the landlord to the love affair between the minister and a woman. Is it not too fantastical that a woman of a despised Gypsy race would be so loved by a minister who is a teacher, even to the point where the feudal lord on whom he depends allows them to marry?</p>
<p>This "The Little Minister" film directed by Richard Wallace is quite remarkable in terms of technique. In the competition for literary and artistic films, the essential elements of elaborate production, from the selection of actors, background, and the authenticity of costumes and props, are not taken lightly.</p>
<p>Full of the simple flavor of the Scottish countryside, the passionate tears of the Gypsy girl, and the humorous ridicule, it is a clear and readable pastoral song, a lyrical short poem, a landscape sketch, and a quick sketch cartoon.</p>
<p>The performances of everyone in the cast are very average. Landell, who plays the drunk Roddy, Donald Crisp, who plays the doctor McQueen, Manley Gordon, who plays the old poor Langley, and the mother of the janitor, etc., are no less skilled than the two leading actors. Strictly speaking, the leading actress Katharine Hepburn is still able to give full play to the passionate and unrestrained personality that the Gypsy girl Babbie should have. John Beal, who plays the little minister, also has more solemn and calm demeanor, but lacks passionate and unrestrained performance.</p>

<p>Since Diantong Company moved its factory and expanded its scale, it has not only strived for excellence in quality but also paid attention to mass production in quantity. In order to combat the trend of shoddy manufacturing on the one hand and save the current depression of the Chinese film industry on the other, it has now formed four directing teams and mobilized according to the entire plan. In addition to Xu Xingzhi's "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm," Situ Huimin's "Goddess of Freedom," and Yuan Muzhi's "Metropolitan Scenery," manager Ma Dejian, in order to strengthen his production plan, recently heard that Sun Shiyi had resigned from Lianhua, so he specially invited him to join. He has now been hired to serve as both director and chief screenwriter. In the future, he will focus on the production work of Diantong.</p>

<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>But she knew that day. She heard a child crying in the praying grounds, begging her to leave this place, because people knew about her and the little minister. If she didn't leave, the little minister would be banished from the village. She then tearfully agreed to leave here forever. That night, she left a note with Langley for Gavin. Back at the castle, she urged the duke to marry her. In this sad mood, she even forgot about Langley. When her maid reminded her, she rushed to see her with money. She couldn't help but ask about Gavin's news. Langley told her: "These few days, I heard that Gavin is a little different from usual. Everyone in the village is paying attention to him. I heard it's because of a woman. Miss Babbie, it probably wouldn't be you, would it? He is a good minister... He's coming."</p>
<p>Babbie hurriedly hid in the house, secretly watching him through the small window. His ashen face made her feel her cruelty. She heard him say: "I really don't know what unfortunate things happened to her." At that time, the church bell rang, and he hurriedly said he was leaving: "This is a prayer meeting, I'm never late." But Langley deliberately asked him to move the spinning wheel into the house. This time, Babbie, hiding in the house, simply had nowhere to hide. Gavin then hugged her tightly and said: "Why did you leave me like this? You really don't know how sad I am." She could only explain: "There are some things I want to tell you..." "Tell me you love me, that's enough."</p>
<p>At first, Babbie hardened her heart and said that she was just playing with him, looking for fun. There was no other meaning. But when she looked at Gavin's disappointed look, she had to cry and say: "Oh! No, at first I was afraid so. Later, I really loved you. This is my fault. I shouldn't have done this, I shouldn't have embarrassed you and your mother." The little minister asked: "Do you really love me, and not the Duke of Lindores?" "Do you still ask me that?" "Then we'll go and talk to the duke. He will forgive you." Babbie shook her head and said: "It can't be done. You don't know him. He is very powerful, he will make everyone in the village oppose you." "Then I will defend myself. Aren't we in love? I can't give you up." As he said that, he was about to take her back to see his mother. But the crowd at the prayer meeting had to make him hurry back. He told her to go see his mother first.</p>
<p>Babbie arrived at his house. The one who opened the door for her was not Mrs. Gavin, but Jeannie. When Jeannie saw her, she reproachfully asked her that she shouldn't have caused the little minister to be banished from the church because of her. While Babbie was defending herself, Mrs. Gavin came down from upstairs. After she knew that Babbie was her son's lover, she not only didn't get angry, but also welcomed her and loved her. But what else did she know?</p>
<p>Babbie heard the noisy voices outside the door and knew that something was wrong. She immediately tried to get Mrs. Gavin upstairs. She herself went to open the door for the elders from the church. She sorrowfully begged them not to see Mrs. Gavin directly, at least to ask them to say it to her. Thomas shouted angrily: "Don't deny that he embraced you with his arms tonight. We all know." "No, you don't know." She said angrily, retreating: "Even if you know, it's not a bad thing. He wouldn't do such a thing, don't you know?" (To be continued)</p>
