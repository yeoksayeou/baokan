<p>時評</p>
<h3>斐列賓首任總統之產生  宜</h3>
<p>美國在遠東方面之主要殖民地斐列賓。根據本年三月二十三日羅斯福總統所簽署。而五月十四日斐列賓公民投票所通過之共和邦新憲法。定十一月十五日成立自治政府。該島三十六省及馬尼刺市區舉行總統選舉之結果。參議院議長奎松及參議員奧斯米那以最多稟數當選自治政府第一任正副總統。斐島力爭多年之民族自主。至此已踏上確定的途徑。十年而後。獨立共和國之締造。庶幾可期。此過渡時代首任總統之產生。當爲同情於弱小民族解放運動者所樂聞歡。</p>
<p>然而吾人若對斐列賓獨立前途。加以較大之關心。則此次選舉。實有可注意者　點。其一。奎松在斐歷仟參議院議長。聲望素著。且美國會通過獨立法案。奎松奔走之功。亦不在小。此次當選總統。誠不出吾人意料。但奎松現有之政治勢力。是否植基於斐島多數民衆。尙屬疑問。其反對黨嘗謂彼乃華爾街之代言人。徒知秉承美國意旨。以榨取農民。觀於奎松歷來政治上之措施。以及上年六月間。斐律賓總選舉中。奎松在其原籍依援省所得票數。尙不及反對黨候選人丁摩。可知此等中傷之言。不爲無因。五月初。呂宋島四省農民在沙克拉黨領導之下。發生暴動。推原其故。亦可謂奎松黨高壓手段之反饗。革命政府固僅如曇花一現。而此輩不滿現狀之農民。現猶散處窮鄉僻壤。足爲今後新政府之隱患。奎松此次當選總統。上台以後。是否能一帆風順。尙　言也。其二斐島人口。據統計約近一千四百萬。五月間舉行新憲法投票。投票總數爲一百二十萬票弱。不及全體人口十分之一。其中投贊成票者佔一百十五萬七千九百有餘。此次總統選舉。則投票人數更少。卽當選總統之奎松。亦僅得四十九萬八千餘票。較之新憲法贊成票數相差猶遠。一般斐列賓人對於新憲法及今次選舉。似尙缺乏眞正的熱情。良以新憲法載有保留條項。「斐列賓須承認美國主權。其官員且須官誓效忠美國。」月餘以後所能實現之新的政制。因亦遠非醉心獨立之多數斐列賓人之理想耳。</p>
<p>民生精神之美國。對於斐列賓殖民地。久感鞭長莫及之苦。目前所以尙不願遽爾放棄宗主權者。實恐斐列賓脫離美國以後。或將投入日本帝國主義之懷抱耳。在此太平洋上英美日三國關係錯綜之情勢下。斐列賓人圖獲完全的獨立自主。今後自尙有待於相當的努力。非僅憑一紙憲法所能奏效也。</p>

<h3>日內瓦建議　意相表示難接受　阿洛錫返國欲行又止　使國聯發生痛苦印象</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）五國委員會之建議現靜待意阿兩國之答覆、雙方如能接受、以爲討論之根據則調解談判將繼續進行、何時召開國聯行政院會議之問題亦將擱置、如兩造中之一造拒絕接受此項建議、則國聯行政院將立卽開會、决定今後之步驟、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）意代表阿洛錫昨允法總理賴伐爾之請、將返羅馬親自努力勸墨索里尼接受五人委員會之建議、現悉阿洛錫已得羅馬消息、墨氏不欲接受日內瓦之任何勸吿、故今日已取銷羅馬之行、觀此則五人委員會之報吿書載有解决意阿爭議之和平辦法者、不日將爲意國所拒絕矣、阿洛錫比舉、已吏國聯發生痛苦印象、蓋覺意相終無改變其東菲作戰决心之意也、</p>
<h3>報告書內容分三部</h3>
<p>委員會報吿雖尙未發表、但據可恃方面云、內分導言議定書與扶助計劃三種、叙言爲追述前事之性質、言及一九二三年阿比西尼亞關於奴制及軍火貿易之擔任、並言及阿國代表請求國聯襄助阿國改善其金融經濟與政治地位事、議定書載阿國對於各項建議之一般承認　扶助計劃規定在國聯主持下、輔以歐人顧問、改革各種公共役務、其最重要者、爲憲兵警政與司法、外人顧問團之職務如、（一）取締奴制與私人軍火貿易保障外商等安全、防止掠奪及奴隸買賣、（二）鼓勵阿國利源之經濟上開拓、許外人有鑛產讓與權與開闢地利之機會、在工商業上謀取增多對外貿易之便利、並延聘外人專家襄助郵政公共工程及運輸與交通工具之發展、（三）嚴格管理財政修正稅則並研究與外債制度有關之專利可能性、（十九日路透電）。</p>
<h3>明日閣議最後取决</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意內閣昨日集讓、末有重要决定、因調查意阿爭議之國聯五人委員會報吿書尙未接到、故定星期六日復開內閣會議、據一般意見、五人委員會之建議决不能解决此項爭議、預料星期六日內閣集議時、不獨將拒絕五人委員會之建議、且將關閉接受日內瓦方面任何調解性質的建議之門、至於意國退出　聯之問題、與對阿開戰之日期、如何决定、則星期六日未必遽卽公佈、衆信意國非至其地位萬不可忍耐時、必不退出國聯、如國聯票决制裁或通過申斥案、如應付德國重置軍備事然、則意國將不能再留於國聯中矣　大約戰事之發作、不必由於正式宜戰但將以若干細事爲大戰爆發之導火綫、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>和平局勢岌岌可危</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）關於和戰問題、現當視羅馬方面如何决定以爲斷、自意國備戰以來、國聯會人士有爲和平局勢岌岌可危、英國自難置身事外、觀於意相墨索里尼所發表之談話、而由黃國每日郵報於本日晨間所發表者、足見意國接受五國小組委員會所提出之建議案、以之作爲談判基礎一層、殆已完全絕望、國聯會人士對於意國總代表阿洛錫並未接獲羅馬訓令一點、（卽令其歸國請訓之謂）似甚重視、小組委員會中某某國代表會一再要求阿洛錫務將日內瓦方面對於意國之輿論、向該國首相從實說明、此外主持國際外交各主要人物、現方竭力設法、務使意阿兩國在菲國所可發生之武裝衝突、不致在歐洲方面發生影響、英國不管部閣員艾登、今晨曾與法國總理兼外長賴伐爾相會談、歷一小時始畢、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>割讓瘠地跡近滑稽　墨索里尼表示不滿</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日每日郵報載意相墨索里尼對該報訪員而發之談片、謂國聯計畫、不獨不可接受、且亦滑稽、渠尙未接到五人特委會之報吿、但若報紙所猜測者、果屬眞確、則其提議似爲諷誚性質、殆以意國在東菲開拓之需要、不妨以一個鹹地與一個右地之一對不毛區域割與意國以應付之也、五人特委會豈以渠爲不毛地之收藏家乎云（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>法報勸意接受和解　不是則將起嚴重後里</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國報紙鑒於英國態度之强硬、傾向於警吿墨索里尼、勸其接受國聯之建議、而勿走極端、以免擾亂一股和平、巴黎迴聲報評論五國委員會建議稱、英國顯然祇許意國獲得經濟權利、而墨索里尼則要求軍事行動自由、但該報認　氏在原則—以接受日內瓦之建議爲有利、蓋英國海軍在地中海之行動業已表示如意國堅持遠征則有嚴重發展之慮、墨索里尼如能接受和解、則均於和平之功非淺、法國將盡力爲意國斡旋談判也云、至於英國海軍之行動使全部問題趨於複雜小巴黎人報之日內瓦訪員稱、大國如意大利　如能接受日內瓦方面出於意外之寬大建議當不致喪失其國家之地位、反之、接受後確能增加意國之聲望云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<h3>英法等國　考慮對意制裁　談判已至相當程度</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）今日得悉、英法等國現正考慮一種對意「漸進的」制裁、美聯社從消息靈通方面得悉、墨索里尼之拒絕國聯建議自在意中、採取制裁步　之談話現已至相當程度、其計盡如下、（一）國聯會員國一致自意國徹回大使公使、（二）實行財政及經濟抵制、（三）漸次禁止對意輸出、以達完全之經濟封鎖、並用各國海軍執行之茲悉五國委員會現正建議設立五人監督制、由其中每人分別統制阿比西尼亞之行政·警察·財政·司法·及衛生等五部、此項監督制則另由國聯代表爲總監、（十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>英工黨內部　對制裁意見歧異　彭森璧辭去工黨領袖　克里浦斯亦辭執委職</h3>
<p>（倫敦）工黨中人對於意阿問題之態度、不相融洽、故已發生嚴重分裂、上議院工黨領袖彭森璧勳爵今日已辭去工黨領袖之地位、未幾又聞工黨全國執行委員會克里浦斯亦辭職、因不贊成其他執委贊助政府外交政策之政策、且因不欲以自己之意見妨礙同黨工作也、彭森璧聲稱、渠對於外交重要事件、與同意見大相逕庭、工黨所抱對於國際艱難局百之態度、已使渠不能繼績爲黨服務、渠始終抱和平非武力所能致之主張云、衆料工黨隊伍中不久尙有意見分歧之發展、又黨執委會定明日舉行臨時緊急會議、以處理領袖諸人意見各異事、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿國政府現擬禁止外國僑民在阿國內地自由來往、但經阿皇覲自核准者則不在其內阿國京城居民態度頗爲鎭靜、一般人相信戰禍向不至立卽發作則以東菲洲一帶道路不適於行軍、意國軍隊未必能立卽攻召阿國也、官方人士則以爲意大利進攻阿國、軍事準備似尙未完畢、在十二月初以前、可望不至發生戰爭云、又此間人士聞地中海及印度洋英國海軍艦隊調動消息、則頗爲興奮（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>應付未來事變　英艦隊集中地中海　美考慮移穢大西洋　保護海上貿易自由</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日之地中海或將成爲歷史上空前之海戰塲所、以自英國本部開往與自中國及其他各處調回之英海軍、現皆向此古海集中、其中自魚雷小艦起、上室艨艟巨艦止、無不俱全、意國海軍或將衛護意大利半島之雙側、唯非洲與歐洲之沿海一帶則以重兵扼守、空軍則開始在天空示威、因地中海爲狹長之裏海、故海戰發生時、舉凡飛機之轟炸、海岸之砲擊、以及巡艦潛水艇等、皆將一應用、顧英意備戰雖亟、但土耳其·希臘·埃及亦亟謀自衛、美聯社記者探悉、意國潛水艇之通過，彝士運河者已有十二艘、（九月十八日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）海軍部長史璜生今日與新聞記者晤會時答記者之問話、謂一旦大西洋對岸發生戰事、則美國艦隊將有何爲、此層從未考慮及之、如艦隊一部份有調至大西洋之必要、則政府當考慮此問題、此舉志維護中立法律、以免航路受人干涉、美國希望戰事不致發生、但若意阿果起衝突、則美國海軍當爲將準備調太平洋之軍艦移至大西洋、以保護美國航業云、（十八日路透電）</p>

代那德里姆，成為加里玻璃，那末比較堅固，不容易破損，他如石英製的玻璃，雖然能耐高熱，然而大驗阿爾加里的。（四）電木製的食器，近來市上出品很多，可是電木一遇酸性的東西，就起化學作用，比鉛性中毒為尤甚。小西天  張恨水著　　第十九回　大員惜羽毛敲門有術新歡離骨肉探病無由　　藍太太道：你活見鬼？我那裏抖……一句話未曾說完，只聽得樓底下，有人大喝一聲。嚇得藍太太面如土色，立刻把話停住。其實倒並不涉及樓上什麼事，乃是樓底下的客人叫茶房。藍專員鼻子哼着，淡笑了一聲。裘則誠雖是很恭敬的站若，也是很忍不住笑意的樣子，微低了頭，將嘴唇皮咬着。等藍氏夫妻都不作聲了，這才低聲道：這事情，我們總應當作一個結束。現在那個姓張的，還在我屋子裏等着回信呢。他的意思，想得藍先生一句實在的話。就敢負責去作調人。藍專員道：什麼？難道還要向我提出什麼條件來不成？則誠道：那或者不至於．不過說幾句好話，把這風潮息了，却也未嘗不値。說時，依然挺立在專員面前，彷彿是等他的最後句話。藍專員把怒氣平息過來了，想到今晚上所作的事，實在有此說不過去，便默然的將雪茄用勁吸了兩下，才無精打彩的點了兩點頭道：那也好，就叫那個姓張的來，我當面問他兩句罷。則誠受了剛才一番驚恐，自己也是拿不出多大主意來，彷彿請張介夫去見藍專員，也是一個辦法。於是扭轉身來，出門就去找介夫。一掀門簾子，一個黑影子閃立門邊，眼前突然的有了障碍物，嚇得心裏猛可跳上兩下，那黑影子却說出話來道：是專員請我去嗎。（三二〇）御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　我便向一個正醒着的太監說道：　　「老佛爺有旨：許你們馬上趕到園裏邊去，立刻把那些管種花的人喚起來，胃着雨去把那些新長成的菊秧一起用蘆粥蓋好，不準讓大雨將它們打壤！」　　那太監聽了我的話，怎敢遲疑，便冒着雨沒命的奔出去了。　　隔了十分鐘梭樣，他又急急忙忙的奔回來了。　　「他們已早就用蘆蓆把那些菊秧全　着了！」這是他帶回來的一個很滿意的報吿。　　原來那些當着園丁職務的太監，也深知太后是非常愛惜　的花木的，而且憑着他們的經騐，更無需可嚀地已知道那些初長成的菊秧是萬萬經不起大雨的，所以不待通知，早就自動的給它們蓋上蘆蓆了。從這一伴事上看來，宮裏頭的太監能幹的委實很能幹，端的未可一槪鄙視！　　這一夜就此很平安地過去了，太后也就亳無掛念的翻過身去，重覓黃梁，待伊第二日好夢醒來，祇見窗紗上巳滿映着日光了；伊知道昨夜下的大雨已經停止，心上頓覺很歡暢，梳洗過後，便决意沐着晴和的陽光，走到園內去瞧瞧伊那些心愛的花卉，經過了一塲大雨之後，又是怎樣的景象（四二〇）</p>

<p>自由談「五四」的「實情」  羊棗　　曹聚仁先生因自由神影片「　　主義」地把五四學生運動中的學生寫做「新式的英雄，」肯為社會犧牲的人物，把那些人物所住的「第一等」「富麗『的小洋房改成了節陋狹小的較室，沒有忠實地描　他們所過的金迷紙醉的生活，和他們被收買，被利用的卑鄙齷齪的政客式的活動，於是在自由談輕蔑嘲駡地暴露出「當時的實情一，說那時的學生代表等於南宋周密齊東野語听記的南　游士：「多無檢束，羣居率以私喜怒軒　人。甚者以植黨撓官府之政，叩　攬　陟之權；或受賂覥詆朝紳，或設局騙脅民庶。一結尾，他以為我們應注意五四運動的時代意義，一而千萬不要看重那幾個滿身霉菌，時勢所造成的英雄！「顯然，曹先生是重視五四運動整個，而十分看不起那運動中的人物的。　　重視五四運動整個，我們沒有異議：但是一概抹段地駡得那運動中的人物的狗屎不如，似乎不見得就算眞認識了「當時的實情；而且，重視一運動而扔掉其中的人物，又豈能算眞　視了那運動的意義。　　「五四」時代，我不在杭州，不　得那邊的「實情」，但北方！尤其我所在的唐山—的「實情」，我是應該曉得一點的，因我也曾參加那運勁　一個小卒。　　我們沒有「第等小洋房一的會所，我們沒坐過　等車，沒住過「新新旅館」，沒吃過「聚豐園」，沒坐過「包申」。我們的「會所」是飯廳，「辦公室」是兩張床一張桌子的寢室：我們到豐潤，澳州，永平（盧體），遷安等地方去，除灤州坐三等火車外，其餘都是坐大車，騎驢了，最多時還是仗爺娘生的兩條腿聞步走，爬過沒有九溪十八澗，龍井，雲棲的荒山，涉過無橋無船沙河；住，除當地學校當局特別恩准時，只有馬　臭，人汗羶的大車店：吃，除盡地主之誼的學生們在他們的飯廳請客，只有麵條子，大餅和蒼蠅可滿的熟切肉。至於「英雄的對手」——「美人」，我們是影子也沒見過，因為那時北方的男校沒有女生，而我們裏　女校差不多都沒有。　　我們也曾在講台上閙過一慷慨激昂痛哭流涕的頑意兒」，但我敢發誓沒有人是在和「政客一樣穿了各種外套」在「扮演」。我們也曾「植黨撓官府之政」，「叩　　　陟之權」，但撫心自問决沒起過絲毫「設局　脅」的念頭。也許我們出的地方小，不够資格，但至少足以證明那運動中的人物還有和曹先生所說兩樣的。　　這樣，訴出我所知的「實情」，我决不是在暗示只有我們才是「新式的英雄」，「眞肯刻苦社會犧牲」的人物。正相反，我們不是「英雄」，只是憑了股熱氣在那兒胡鬧的一羣孩子。不用說怎樣才眞能　社會犧牲，把社會弄好」　不多　社會究竟是個什麼東西都不懂得、而且，我决不是在自諮我們羣中都是實心眼幹　的，我們裏而有的是祇想在會塲上出鋒頭，被舉什表拿同學捐出的錢到北京上海等大地方去開心。但達到月的去了回來，被大家在飯堂臭駡的情形，却也鮮明地還印在我腦裏。　　關於南方，尤其上海，北「實情」我們雖不深知，但根据我們的代表回來後報吿，我們也確曉得有此「英雄」是在坐「馬車」，跑「飯局」，軋　人」；但我們還知道另有更多的人是一天到晚在會所裏啃燒餅，睏地板，寫宣言，擬計畫，或邁着兩條腿四處拉人開會，站在馬路上演說……　　但凡一個運動，不，任什麼事物，用術語說就是「過程」，其內容和表觀决沒有淸一色的。一只生物在原細胞初成形的時候，其中已含了破壞他的「霉菌」。這生物的發展和成長，正是其健全的細胞與所含的一霉菌」奮鬥的歷史。五四運動是一個從霉爛透頂的舊社會裏爆發出來新生的胞胎，它那裏能不含遺傳下來的「霉菌」；別方面，它所含又豈只是「霉菌」而沒有一世健全的細胞？　　如果我們要看重五四運動的意義，我們一定得先認識它是一個在矛盾的社會裏爆發出來，因而必然含有一切矛盾成份的社會的，也就是人的運動。如此，假使我們要研究，描寫，那運動，我們怎能扔掉其中「人」的成份？誰都知道那運動有它的光明面，也有它的黑暗而，則它的「人」的成份豈又祇有黑暗面，而沒有光明面？　　旣說「五四運動顯示時代靑年的光明追求，顯示小市民的反抗意識一，却又說五四時代的學生代表全等於「受賂覥詆朝紳」，「設局騙脅民庶」的政客，我們真不知道那些學生代表是從什麼產出的，是不是從那時代追求光明的靑年，懊反抗意識的小市民？難道凡被舉為代表的都是「穿外套搬演」的政客，或一經被舉為代表就立刻都變得會「賣身投靠」嗎？如果它所有的代表全是如此卑鄙和黑暗，我們眞不知道五四運動怎樣會「顯示時代靑年的光明追求」和「小市民的反抗意識」。論事不論人，就個人或可以應用這種方法，對於一個廣大的，劃時代的社會運動，也那樣折衷地處理，恐怕永還不會看出「常時的實情」吧？　　我們不否認五四運動因它所處的時代和環境，必然要包含許多「霉菌」成份，而正因為一霉菌一太多了，五四運動不能有很大的成就，使我們到現在還聽到和看見無窮的「卑鄙手腕」。這種手腕在五四運動中確一早已具體而微的試用着」，决不是從五四運動起才聞始試用的啊—五四運動確含有電菌，然决不是它下的種子，而也是遺傳得來的啊！　　別方面，五四運動决不是除霉菌而外，就毫沒有健全的細胞的。細胞的力量過能是事實，正如前面所說，許多人連社會究是什麼東西都不大知道，因此，五四運動乃終於祇是五四運動。然而，也正因為五四運動有那些健全的細胞，以後才能發　起來形成其他運動。　　五四時代所種下的不是「霉菌」，是健全的發展着的細胞。　　我懂得曹先生的意恩，曹先生是　我們別上「自由神影片的當，不要以為現存的從五四學生運動出身的「英雄」是「眞肯為社食犧牲」的人物。這是一點也不錯的但曹先生過了火，走到另一極端去了，就忘記那　運動中，即在「代表」裏面，也還有優心眼眞幹的人，而五四運動的眞正代表不是的者，乃是後者。這樣，如果「自由神」把五四學生運動的人物單純地寫成了「新式的英雄」是理想主義，曹先生前統地駡倒他們則可，不過因為這而否定一切，那末曹先生就有些，因太通世故人情而流人無條件的輕蔑嘲駡的Sophi　ticism了。滙泉殘壘  劉明　　剛走進鐵棚門，沒人影的路岑寂地伸在面前；那些雖未枯萎但已失掉夏天鮮活氣的洋槐林，和林下蔓生的野草，就漸　包圍過來。偶在轉灣處，又忽然碰見伏在路邊强盜似的那些灰頹的小石屋，和帶着銹鐵柵門而且粘有蛛絲綱的暗黑地道，便使人不禁覺得此地不僅荒凉，且有些可　了。　　可是，一登上頂去，槐林蔭中，驀地閃出一座八角亭子，和一間賣汽水零食的精緻小屋，以及三兩個在秋陽中悠閒坐着等候遊客的職業照像家時，就立刻愜意地抒了一口氣，彷彿剛從可疑的地方逃出了那麼似的。雖然，同時在這里，四五尊戴着圓形鋼蓋子的德國大砲，正英武地從地下伸了出來，對着東南海面，做着　準的姿勢，但看起來却已經失掉了那一種嚇人的氣槪，和殘酷的氛圍。　　這是匯泉殘壘首次給我的印象，時候正値暑退之後的中秋。　　匯泉殘壘在伸入海中的匯泉岬上，與太平洋岬遙遙相對，凡欲進膠州灣的船隻，都須打這兒過去，實係靑島的第一個門戶。先前，德國人不惜十年工夫，億萬金錢，把此地築為砲壘，原非徒然的。但為了一時租借之地，覓建下百年大計的防禦工程，至今想來，仙們那　併呑目的之大，實在令人　畏。　　壘中尙留有鐵軌電燈的遺跡，以及寢室廚房藥庫等等，惜此行抱有方出世二月多的嬰兒，未能下去仔細觀瞧，到是歉然的事情。　　不過，站在亭上，從槐林疎處，俯視下去，差不多可說是四週都漏出了碧藍的海面，和聽着隱約送來的濤聲，卻也的確能繪出一種淸幽和怡悅的境界，使人感到滿意。　　賣汽水零食的小屋壁上，嵌有馬福祥的觀潤亭記，說是德國估領時代，華人不得登臨此地，約有二十年，則　們小百姓能在今日雍容遊息其上，把克虜伯廠製的兇蠻武器，看成木石，撫之唾之，一任己意，眞是難得，雖然，說起來這原是屬於使倖的　　然而，倘若，能在全世界一切的砲壘上面，像今大一般，同着妻兒，指點殘松斷壘，閒話往事，或則將孩子騎在大砲上面，以作嬉戲，則此也算人生最大娛樂之一了。鋼繩斷了  露野女士　　天剛剛亮，人聲就到處嘈雜着，沒有一處，甚至於每一個角隅，不是在談論着昨夜發生的意外的事件，也是礦塲近年來所未有的慘劇。人們都知道了在礦塲南面的礦井下是犧牲了二十三個工人。　　原因是這樣，在昨夜十點班礦工換班時，六點班的工人，從地底坐着上升的謙籠將要接近地面時，絞輸的鋼繩斷了，罐籠翻了十九個筋斗，碰着礦井的邊沿，士壤和石塊在落下去，所以這二十三個工人就因此而送命。　　這事在昨夜十一點鐘時　傳遍了全礦塲，以致死者的家屬，並且員司工人，都在連夜的忙動着。因此——　　只要東方稍稍的吐出了魚肚白，幾隻雀兒不耐煩的呌着，礦　的第次汽笛放出，火車的怪叫聲從遠處傳來，慢慢地在鐵軌上蠕動着的輪聲時，人們的論調，嚎啕，哭呌，也就隨着這一切洶湧起來；不但整佩的礦塲陷於不安，就是怒吼着的北風，也有些近於凄厲了。　　粉紅色的朝陽，照遍了大地，風從原野上刮來，在四圍山岳圍繞着的礦塲，是比別處更冷。　　工人們燃起了一堆堆的炭火取暖，一副副的面孔都特別顯得悽愴，本來，在這氛圍里是該舒服的，但是北風料峭，他們的手仍然是　腫的，緊硬的。他們有的連破棉衣都沒得穿，在狂風中，在蒼空下，在一堆堆的煤堆旁，有氣無力的顫動着，打著寒顫。　　此外，有着幾個無家可歸的乞兒，在工廠的附近，用了　詫的眼光傻望着烟囱，煤屑吹進了他們的眼睛，無意地擠出了幾顆瑩瑩的淚珠。那凜烈的北風斷續地襲來，從衣服的破綻中吹進去，兩肩高高的豎起，頸項縮了下去，齒縫間發出了競競的聲音，手上凍出了紫色的裂痕，淌着鮮紅的血。幾乎，在每年這個時節，他們都無法避免的。　　當火車又放出汽笛，輸運着黑得發亮的煤，由礦塲傲慢地輾過，機器震天的響動着，在礦塲二尤其是在廠里，除了緊張得有些忙亂外，一切都是森冷。　　這里，仍有你一時所數不淸的人在蠕動着。黑的煤屑和煤灰，在他們的衣服上，面孔上，頭頂上，甚至兩隻粗糙的大手上塗着。不過，在這里也有可以使得你注意的地方，例如站崗的警察的增多，使得礦塲在忙亂中更增加了些威嚴，好像是騷動將臨的前一刻。　　當然，只要是廠方的負責人牠們的工作都是緊張的，一點也不鬆懈，他們便成了機器。但是死者的遺骸在礦井下，是要防碍工作的進行，而且死者的家屬要來見屍體，所以在往日里罐籠升降的地方，現在沒有了罐籠的升降，而那絞輪宏大的鄉聲再也聽不到了。　　於是這里圍繞着一大羣人，除却了工作人員之外，有着不幸的比死者還要更慘痛的婦孺們，在沒有認到死者的屍體以前，眼淚包在她們的眼眶里，便焦灼着茫然無所措。孩子們更是不知其所以然的呆望着睜着圓圓的眼睛，滿塗着煤炭的面孔，十望着媽媽們，姐姐們，工人們；個個的，由側旁的人行道中去掏這此死者的遺骸。　　一個個的，她們都會在萬分的傷心中和焦灼中去我到。並且都會在不約而同的情境中放聲的痛哭起來。於是——　　這里除了將近嘶啞的哭呌聲，憤怒的叱駡聲，絕望的訴苦聲，之外，局外人另有着副憂愁和厭惡的面孔。在這一羣，不管他們是不幸的，或者是幸運的，低級的，或高級的人；在同一的時間中呈現出來的，在北風的怒吼中。太陽慘淡地昭着地面上，都是一樣悽絕的表情。　　那不同樣的聲音跟着北風吹來，順着工人們拾着的屍首，人羣蜂攤的通過了礦塲的機器廠，電氣台，水塔，……最後抬到了間大屋子裏。屋裏的嚎啕聲和外面的北風怒吼聲相配合；天是漸漸地黑了，裏面是陰沉沉的閃着幾閃掉着淚水的灼光。那零亂的屍體旁，人們的哭聲是模糊着。然而，哭不是個辦法，在這些發狂似的婦女們的哭聲由高而低而破啞，最後只能變成微細的呻吟了。——這是奇怪的，而且是任何人也想不到的好像這羣人已經沒有了氣息。　　當婦女們已經是疲倦到了極點的時候，另有一位老太太却打破了這沉寂的空氣，而要使人們感到十二萬分的淒慘　樣了，他們雖然也一樣用着破啞了嗓子哀呼，腫紅紅的眼睛夾着淚水，抖顫的帶着强烈的憒怒……　　夜慕漸漸的漸漸的垂着大地，幾顆星星閃耀着亮光，追隨　慘白了顏色的月亮。風仍是怒吼者在山岳平原，一直刮　了礦場的工廠中，樣器的響聲，火車的汽笛聲，伴著這恐怖的夜晚，人聲早已消失盡了。發燒的手  大保　　非常簡單地，　　朋友，你去了。　　大家省却了虛偽的酬——　　你給我一隻發燒的手，　　我給你一隻發燒的手，　　你的手吿訴我：　　我的手吿訴你：　　我們，沸騰的血流，　　定要掃蘯世間一切的敗類！　　非常簡單的，　　朋友，你去罷！　　末了，請記留這一回的握手，　　算是我們眞誠的送禮。寄宿舍（四）  J·喬易斯作立波譯　　他想著他是被騙了。他可以和想像他的朋友會談到這事，笑著。她是一個小小的俗人；有時的所做的事他不能决定到底要喜歡她昵還是鄙視她。自然他也做了。他的天性勸他自由自在，不要結婚。俗語說，你一結婚你就完了。　　當他穿着襯衫和畏褲無力地坐在牀緣的時候，她輕輕的叩着門，走進來了。她告訴他一切，吿訴他：她在她母親面前照直　陳了，她的母親那天呈上會要知他談話。她哭起來，她的手臂圍在他的頸上，說：　　「呵，白浦！白浦！我怎樣辦呢？我究竟怎樣辦呢？」　　她想了結自己，她說。　　他柔弱地撫慰她，呌她不　哭，事情會很如實的，不要怕。他的襯衫上覺到了她的胸的激動。　　這一切完全不是他的過錯。用獨　者的奇妙的緊忍的記憶力，他很清楚地記。她的衣裳，她的呼吸和她的丰指給他的最初的意外的愛撫。後來有一夜，夜已深了，他正要脫衣上床的時候，她膽怯地　叩仙的門。她要在他的燭上接燃她的燭，因為她的被風吹熄了。這是她入浴的夜。她穿了一件印花法蘭絨的鬆散寬大的梳洗短衣。她的白潔的脚背在毛皮的拖鞋口上發出光輝，她的香氣盈溢的皮膚裏，血熾熱地燒着。她燃了燭，扶好燭的時候，從她的手和腕上也發出微微的香氣。　　許多晚上，他回來很晚的時候，是她，熱好他的晚餐。他差不多不知道在吃什麼，她單獨地在他的旁邊，在晚上，在睡靜了的房孑裏。還有她的親戚！如果夜是有些寒冷，有些潮濕或多風的話，靠得住有一小杯調合甜酒給他準備　那裏。也許他們一道可以幸福罷。……</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言南京路減租糾紛事件  夢若　　本市减租運動，巳實行年餘，成績雖不算如何美滿，但一部分房主，迫於時勢，頗能體諒各房客的苦衷，均允按折照减。然大多數人，尙未肯退讓，仍堅持維持原租金。致此項要求，難以普及。此减租會所以不能不再接再厲，繼績努力，以期達到最後的目的，不意近日南京路哈同洋行房客，因要求减租，房主不允，遂致發生糾紛。綠三益綢緞局等，以市面蕭條，營業不振，曾行聯名請求，照其新租與人之房價比例，减低租金，以昭公允。詎該洋行竟始終推諉，堅持租約，不肯通融。房客方面不得已，暫停付租。由是該洋行最近遂派人帶同司閽捕，分向各商家，威嚇壓迫，幾至釀成事故。現三益綢緞局等，已致函納稅華人會，市民總會，减租委員會及各公團，籲請主持公道。聞减租會昨召開緊念會議，結果議决出力援助，藉資對付。　　查本市减租運動，巳為全市三百萬居民一致的要求。稍具見識的房主，應立卽自動减租，以輕房客的負担。今哈同洋行，竟不顧各商家的能力，堅持維持原租約，實在不知變通。且上海房租，以南京路一帶為最昻貴。若在繁榮時期，自不成問題。但近來市面的慘落日甚一日。南京路雖舊日為一商業中心點，現時市况，亦巳衰頹不堪，非往昔可比。幾間立得住足的商家，有的僅足維持，有的則皆屬勉强掙扎。今哈同洋行房客三益綢緞局等，向其要求按照新租與人之房價比例，减低租金，原甚公道。哈。同洋行卽使不願通融，亦儘可依法解决，何竟派人威脅，擾及營業耶。　　邇來本市百業停滯，淸理倒閉，時有所聞。此原因雖極複雜，然房租之昂貴，亦有以促成之。故一般人均主張復興市面，應以减低房租為前提。蓋房租為各商家一重大的負担，如能减低房租，實多少可以救濟商家之困。　　此减租運動所以得各方面的同情，而節節進行。且市面的發達與否，奧房產業者息息相關。市面發達，房產業者亦隨之面繁榮。反之，則房產業者亦必隨之而衰落。故我們甚願本市房主，能不貪圖一時之利，自動减租，以副房客之望，此正是一共存共榮之道也。金魚區巡禮  蒙胥　　近來的生活有點轉變，經不起開門七件事的威脅而戚到彷徨，想找等一點趣味的工作來排除苦悶，於是我開始學養金魚。　　住得房子並沒有天井，門前却有一個小小的草坪，拔去那些野草閑花，和的我弟弟兩人在烈日之下先築起魚池來了。魚池的面積並不大，但可以養上七八尾大金魚池之外，又有缸，成行地放上五隻注滿了淸水，巳經經過好幾日的太陽和夜露了，池底放下雨花臺石，池的一旁還栽着一點點睡蓮。缸呢，淸水巳經變成淡綠。於是，在一個大淸早就跑到閘北去選購金魚。　　我們在中山路大約走上了十多分鐘，便巳見到「良種。」是一位天津人辦</p>

<p>的魚塲，夾馬路分設兩部。好魚不少，但沽量價錢方面一定很有可觀，徘徊了一回，便沉默地走了。一走就走到「留春」「留春」的範圍，比良種大些，魚的數量也着實不少，五年的「紅龍」的顏色的確可愛，問起價錢來，老司務回說非八塊錢一對不可。其實應不貴，至少，他們已經費了五年工夫，祗有一塊六角錢一年的代價而己。然而，我是買不起的，祗好拉住弟弟又走了。　　我和弟弟商量：有招牌的魚塲是我們無從「問鼎」的，還是到較大的沒有招牌的魚塲去吧。弟弟也以爲然，便望共和新路拐到阿福的魚傷去，阿福是我弟弟熟識的一個魚熱。魚塲的規模倒不少，有三四畝地方，但顯然是衰落了。籬笆可以鑽進野狗，魚池已經七零八落，缸呢，算起來有二百左右，都是陳貨，養魚是最好不過的。　　我們在阿福的魚塲裏先看「五花洋龍，」一大池中約有三十來尾，看樣子是養上了兩年的了，色彩尙艷，但非佳種，我們蹲在池邊選了好一回，才選到了一對。要看「蛋種」「朝天龍，」魚的數量和「五花洋龍」差不多，可身體長得應不大好，也祗選了一對。「朝天龍」很別致，體若垂蛋，兩眼朝天，美國人呼牠爲「千里眼」，其實是極端近視。再看他的「水泡眼，」又看他的「翻腮」，「絨球」，和「高顯」（卽老虎頭，）每樣都選了一對。我們又看他的「龍種」，眼凸尾大，色紅無黃，的是佳種，便又選上一對。論價，要十塊錢，說了幾句笑話之後，就以五元成交。　　從阿福的魚塲裏出來，又到別的魚塲去玩了一回，買了一對「紫魚」一對「珍珠魚」和一對「洋蛋」。「紫魚」渾身紫色，「珍珠魚」的魚鱗反捲，顆顆如珠，「洋蛋」全體無鱗，肚腸可見，是東洋變出來的異種。我們把買來的魚統一給一個熟　的魚人，叫他送回家去，再和弟弟到處去溜，凡見到草棚的門豎上一隻撈紅蟲的網的便闖進去。然都是些小本經營的小規模魚塲，花上一百幾十塊錢，鑿一兩座泥浜，築三四座三和十的魚池，憑着一副擔子去養家活口，養的魚全是些小魚！普通的「龍」和「草種」，每魚的本錢祗花上幾厘，最多一分，挑到市上去賣個六七十錢或者一隻八開，這　　　　　地來維持　　　　　　飄雨的時候，他們是不會發市的，好在他們的草棚的周圍是瓜荳雜栽，薯芋並種，短時間可以不致餓到肚子。但城市居民，又那裏想到他們的生活是這般凄苦。　　金魚本來有很好的國內和國外的市塲，但國外市塲已經給人奪去了。原因國人飼養金魚是死守老法，一成不變；人家則探取最新方法，科學飼養，可以使種類繁多，魚身優秀，色彩艷麗。他們還能够染色，一經染上，可以保持六月之久。我國運銷美國的金魚市場，早就給他們換縱了。　　金魚業近來似乎頗惹起國人注意，中國國貨商塲，大出界及城內都有展覽，上海蓄植公司，冠生園農塲，金魚樂園也都在極力提倡。金魚業並不是不可爲的，利益也還優厚，但須得飼養得宜，經騐充足。據個中人說，天時氣候，都與的金魚健康有關，須得隨處當心，隨時留意，否則一魚得病，不亟於隔缸調治，則全體皆危了。養金魚也不花多大本錢，一畝地方，經常費年約三百，則已綽有裕餘，但不是經過都市生活的人所能做到的。野外  羅之華　　住在都市的人總是希望能够看見野外的景况，從鄉村來到都市的人，更是如此。每天每天地，生活在機器的燥音和塵沙的混合物里，聞着惡心的氣息，刺激的粉香，聽着那些討厭的聲音，誘人的霓虹燈張開網等待你眼睛的注意。每個人，沒有時間去旅行，甚至沒有時間去散步，沒有時間去呼吸；偶而想起了綠的草野，和高高的碧藍的天，心頭不禁曾泛起追思的滋味。　　這次南行，對於我，展開一種新的渴望與安慰。　　我生活在一個小城的鄕村里的人，來到都市以後，每天疲倦了的時候，抬頭看流過白色雲塊的天空：雲塊像被壓著，擠在樓房的屋頂上，天空就鐵葉似地覆蓋下來，好像壓住我的身體。　　當天快要亮的時候，平滬三〇一次車怒嚎著　在大平原上……　　也許是時候早的關係，外邊還黑濛濛的，鳥被驚起，喞喞喳喳地向四周飛。有的就跟要和火車賽跑似的，一大羣一大羣地向前鑽。沿路旁的洋槐樹，被帶著朝前倒？　　天漸漸　亮起來，陽光裏愛地撫模着我的臉子，當我　在　品的　　；　陽光，我多少日子沒能見着了呢？離開那災難緊緊地抓住了咽喉的故鄉到現在，我久沒有看見他從地平線上慢慢地檯起鮮艷的臉。我像接受一伴珍貴的贈禮，親切地溫存着他的光。低下頭，我希望見到寬闊的野外。但是，車正行過一段山路，淡綠的石塊擋住了面，車廂里也暗下來了！　　呵！謝謝天！我的眼前展開了，那樣廣大，那樣遠高的野地！　　不知道是歡欣，還是悲哀，想笑，還不好笑的情形中，轉過去多少里路了　　以前，住在鄕村里的時侯，在春天，在夏天，在秋天，在冬天，在任何一　個季節里，氣候的轉變很快地感受到了。從禾木的生長上，從水果的生熟上，從野外景色的變遝上，看到麥黃了，高粱紅了，看到梨白了，林禽紅了，看到任何一種東西，都會聯想到衣服的更易。來到都市，在冬天可以吃夏天的產物，在夏天可以吃冬天的產物，沒有四季的分別。更看不到野外景色的變遝。　　看到那些高高矮矮的麥子，眞有說不出的滋味。　　深深地吸一口氣。　　但是，鄉村的野外的確是浮蕩着一種土香的，這時怎樣也不會聞到。——全被煤烟掩沒了。　　看了一會，山谷又擁過來。　　我回過頭，車廂里的情形沒有大變更，空着的位子上添了兩個女學生裝的，都很樸素，正爭論着阮玲玉死的社會的意義。似乎都主張是社會把她殺害了，但是，有些地方還不對。我沒有理由參加她們的談論，也沒有必要。那兩個靑年呢，一個俯在　口用望遠鏡看山景，一個用攝影機偷偷地拍車廂角里坐着的女性的像。　　車向前走的很俊，山的回嚮，聒人耳朶。　　進來一個穿灰軍裝的護路隊，坐在「路警崗位」上。　　外面又是綠野了。秋窗絮語  赤子　　早上起來，看見籠子裏的叫哥哥向天翻若薑黃的肚皮，死了。是夏天，有個老者担了呌哥哥到弄裏來販賣家人買了一個懸在牆壁，說是牠的嗚聲孩子聽了可以「避驚」的。每天喂一點瓜花或毛登，牠就終天展翅而鳴。後來同居的都買了一個屋子里幾乎不絕地聽着牠的鳴，此唱彼和。那聲音的嘶長而啞的，但是聽慣了也不覺得刺耳。夏天，我每天寂得很遲，獨自挑燈在窗下讀書，在萬簌俱聲的午夜，牠忽然叫了起來，於是這邊一個那邊一個都相繼和唱着，倒覺別有一種情趣。聽着，聽着，自己往往會在椅子上睡去的；這或許是我的癖好，我是各種虫鳥的。最近幾天，那叫哥哥顯得衰老了。一天難得聽着牠展翅而鳴的時候，聲音亦更嘶啞；倦縮在籠子的一隅，懶得彈動。從前翠綠可愛的身體，漸漸地顯示淺黃色，最後喂的食物都留下來了，牠終於逃不過秋的降臨，死了。　　秋天，是個多虫的季節。蟋蟀，紡織娘，金鈴子，更有許多不知名的嗚虫。想起在　鄉，我的臥室面臨着院子，院子很寬大，二面砌了花牆，種着海棠花，是秋季開放的。翠綠的大葉，紫紅　　　　　的花朶，沿花　　延着。到了夜里，虫聲四起，你簡直辨不淸牠的種</p>
<p>Page 19</p>
<p>類，方向甚至有多少。然而傾耳辨之，　　紡織娘的鳴聲是髙亢而長的；一如牠的名稱，有些女兒氣，幽怨，文雅，有條不紊地；金鈴子的鳴聲則分辨不出來了許多秋虫都是那樣亂七八糟地叫着，而且聲音又細小。我是和　弟合一個臥室的，晚上，在燈下習課，煤油燈旁時常發現那些能飛的秋虫，牠們向着燈罩猛撲，自己投入燈心而送死的很多。但是那些飛進來的虫都不很好看，大的螻蛄，小的木鈴，叫起來咕咕咕地。我們喜歡紡織娘，牠美麗，活潑，又如牠的名稱一樣，雖然叫哥哥的形體和她相同，但不愧做哥哥，有一種丈夫氣的。我們每天晚上躡到花牆邊，用經騐的聽覺辨別紡織娘的所在。牠有六條腿：二對在前，短小，一對在後，有長者三四倍，在秋海棠葉上振翅而鳴的時候，我們祗要輕輕地用食指大指搯住牠的雙翅，牠的後腿雖能踢人，也無用武之地了。一晚之間，可以捕到很多，放在一個特製的大竹籠里，掛在帳鈎上聽它叫引爲趣樂的。到明天早上，我們又盡數釋放，讓牠恢復自由，那姑娘常關在籠子畢，恐怕沒有叫哥哥的壽長，幾天之內就要送命。　　講到捉蟋蟀，更好玩了。我們不知蟋蟀的好歹，是蟋蟀都捕了來豢養在盆里。放到雌雄一對的仍放在一個盆，（當初對於雌雄的分別，遝以爲三尾的是雄的呢）每天把捕來的蟋蟀，用淘汰制大打一番，戰敗的不論多少都關在一個盆里，讓牠們去自相殘殺。勝的一個就愛護備至，居以最精緻的大盆，貯以淸水，米粒，封爲常勝將軍，但是常勝將軍的命運也是很短促，因爲下一天又在捕來的一羣中再選出一個常勝將軍，再要一决雌雄，才榮任此席。有時一個常勝將軍，居然屢戰屢勝，那就要向鄰家的孩子們誇耀了，可是往往敗在他們手里，令人竟日不歡，現在想來不免孩子氣。　　在上海鬥蟋蟀不但賭錢，而且是作爲貨物一樣賣買的，走過西藏路一帶，席地皆是，但我從不注足一觀，現在覺得無閑顧及於此了。播音消息新歌介紹　　母親　天一聲片母親　　母親的光耀，好比燦爛的旭日，永遠地永遠地照着你的心；母親的慈愛，好比和煦的陽春，永遠地永遠地披着你的身。誰關心你的飢寒！誰督促你的學業？只有你偉大慈祥的母親！她永不感到疲倦，她始終打起精神，殷殷地期望你上進，爲了你嘗盡了人世的苦辛！她太疲勞了，你不見她的額上，巳刻上了一條條的皺紋！世界上惟有母親者，是最幸福的人。可是你怎樣報答母親的深恩？國學　　馮明權唐詩　　明遠（九六〇）上午七時半至八時半　　講題杜甫蜀相無名氏吟（題壁七律）劍江春水綠澐澐。五丈原頭日又嘿。舊業未能歸後主。大星光巳落前軍。南陽祠宇空秋革。西蜀關山隔暮雲。正統不慚垂萬古。莫將成敗論三分。　　陳瑞麟陳雲麟落金扇　　市音（一三四〇）下午五時半至六時一刻　　開篇「梁紅玉擊鼓戰金山」　　白茫茫。茫霧震江山。紅赤赤。赤光透天外。烟陣陣。陣烟壯秋色。　聲聲。聲　聞奏凱。姣滴滴。滴婈平康女。眉鎖鎖。鎖眉恨滿懷。義勇勇。勇義梁紅玉。氣昂昂。昂氣率軍隊。裝戎戎。戎裝如月字。弓彎彎。彎弓腰間佩。緊穿穿。穿緊魚鱗甲。戴束束。束戴鳳尾盔。密層層。層密旌旗幟。船點點。點船結速環。計謀謀。謀計金兀朮。恨悠悠。悠恨胡兒來。但見他步輕輕。輕步雲梯上。腰織織。織腰上髙桅。鼓鼕鼕。鼕鼓聲不絕。擊重重。重擊把兵摧。光閃閃。閃光耀秋波。俊俏俏。俏俊含碧翠。昏慘慘。慘昏迷天日。淅索索。索淅散飛灰。唿喇喇。喇飛如蝗箭。密鏘鏘。鏘鎯干戈揮。轟隆隆。白骨如山倒。谷轆轆。人頭滾過來。血濺濺。濺血黄天蕩。氣騰騰。騰氣敗胡番。舞急急。急舞雙鼓棒。汗淋淋。淋汗濕羅衫。勝似似。似勝木蘭女。梁紅玉擊鼓戰金山。靑更名標女英才。歌唱　　夜鶯藝社　　國華（一二〇〇）下午五時至六時　　餓馬搖鈴（前奏曲）永別了弟弟（曼琳）梅花接老爺（露茜）蘇武牧羊（奏茵）風雨歸舟（流朗）最後的安慰（曼琳）永遠在後台（曼琳）新婚燕爾（露茜）警鐘（秦茵）薔薇之蕊（曼娜）　　中華（一一四〇）下午七時一刻至八時　　Under　The　Moon（前奏曲）紅燒丈夫（曼娜）浣衣曲（露茜）小鸚哥（奏菌）人間仙子（流朗）採蓮歌（曼娜）女軍人歌（曼琳）梅花接老爺（露茜）　　安定（八六〇）下午九時至十時　　不自由的花（前奏曲）塞外村女（祭茵）銀色的凄凉（露茜）等一等吧（流朗）（秦茵），香處處開（曼娜）新鳳陽歌（曼琳）夜來香（茜）天倫之愛（曼娜）大地行軍曲（流朗）賣花詞（曼琳）　　飛音社　　中西（一〇四〇）下午六時至七時　　娥眉月（兪月明）我願意（姚瑤）我不能忘記你（姚莉）蘇武牧羊（佈德）好妹妹（兪月明）塞外村女（姚璇）新婚燕爾（姚莉）魚兒跳（佈德）</p>

<h3>The Economic Committee Plans Measures for Blocking and Restoring Dikes of Rivers; Quickly Draft Construction Plans and Funding Amounts; Dispatch Telegrams to Conscientiously Implement and Submit for Review by a Deadline</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Committee, considering the blocking and restoration of dikes along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers to be of utmost urgency, has formulated the following seven-point outline of measures: (1) For the dike-blocking and restoration projects of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the Economic Committee will first order the Yangtze River and Yellow River Water Conservancy Commissions to promptly survey and estimate, in conjunction with the provincial governments, and draft construction plans and funding amounts, which will be submitted to the Economic Committee for approval. (2) Of all construction expenses, the Economic Committee will allocate 50%, with the remaining amount to be the responsibility of the respective provinces to raise. (3) Once the construction plans are approved, the Economic Committee will, depending on the nature of the projects, either supervise the Yellow River Commission or the Yangtze River Commission to oversee the water conservancy agencies of the respective provinces to carry out the work. (4) For the sake of facilitating construction, construction offices may be established according to local conditions to be responsible for implementation. (5) Personnel for the construction offices should be drawn from the existing water conservancy agencies of the various provinces as much as possible to conserve resources. For all important projects, the central government will dispatch additional personnel to handle them. (6) The funds allocated by the Economic Committee will be disbursed in two installments upon commencement of work, with the remainder to be disbursed after periodic inspection and verification of the progress of the project. (7) After the completion of all projects, a report must be submitted to the Economic Committee for acceptance in conjunction with the provincial governments. In addition to submitting the above measures to the National Government and sending a letter to the Executive Yuan, the committee will also dispatch telegrams to the relevant provincial governments and the Yellow River and Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commissions, instructing them to conscientiously implement all measures and submit the construction plans for review by October 20th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Economic Committee telegraphed Han, instructing him to continue presiding over the dike-blocking efforts, and the central government will further raise one million yuan in construction funds, to be immediately allocated. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, Xi Dejiong, arrived on the morning of the 19th to pay respects to Standing Committee Member Kong and Secretary Qin, seeking instructions on dike-blocking and restoration, as well as plans for next year's routine maintenance. Previously, during his tenure as Director of the Engineering Office, Mr. Xi made remarkable contributions in repairing the Yangtze River dikes. This time, he has invited former staff members of the Engineering Office who made contributions to assist in all matters. Once arrangements are finalized, he will proceed to Wuhan to take office immediately. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Passes Through Xuzhou to the Grand Canal; Inspects the Disaster Situation in Pi County; Cheng Jingsheng and Dong Yaotang Accompany Him; Carries Funds for Emergency Relief in Pi and Su Counties; Returned to Xuzhou Last Night to Transfer South</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Xu Shiying arrived in Xuzhou at 6:00 AM this morning via the Jinpu Railway from Nanjing. Shao Hanyuan, Wang Gongyu, and Cheng Biao Jingsheng, who was in Xuzhou to investigate the disaster, were at the station to greet him. After Xu alighted, he met with Shao, Wang, Cheng, and others in the Jinpu Railway waiting room, inquiring about the details of the disaster in Xuzhou. Subsequently, at 9:00 AM, he took the Longhai Railway to the Grand Canal to inspect the disaster situation in Pi County, accompanied and hosted by Dong Yaotang, director of the Longhai Railway Office in Xuzhou. Cheng Jingsheng also went along. They planned to return to Xuzhou in the evening and head south. Xu commented that with the Yellow River breaching in western Shandong, Xuzhou's suffering from the disaster was inevitable, but the extent of the damage would depend on the effectiveness of human efforts in prevention. In the future, in addition to striving for relief, a thorough Yellow River management plan should be implemented as the fundamental solution. Yellow River management requires a dedicated agency and ten years of effort, and it is difficult to achieve results quickly. Whether this can be considered at present is uncertain. Xu carried 12,794 yuan in relief funds, allocating 4,000 to Tongshan, 1,000 to Pei County, and the remainder to Pi and Su counties for emergency relief. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Xu Shiying arrived at the Grand Canal station at noon today and inspected along the Grand Canal. The disaster situation in Dayushu was severe, with a breach of over 70 zhang. The village school was directly impacted, and the waters of the Grand Canal were overflowing. Xu advocated for urgently blocking the breach to allow disaster victims to return to cultivate their land and preserve village school culture. Pi County Magistrate Qin Jieren soon arrived to greet him. Xu immediately handed over 4,000 yuan in relief funds to Qin for emergency relief. At 7:00 PM, he returned to Xuzhou, and at 9:00 PM, he took the Jinpu Railway south with Cheng Jingsheng. Xu stated that the disaster in Xuzhou was extremely severe, and efforts should be made to provide relief. Blocking the breach in Pi County requires 10,000 yuan, which is manageable, but blocking the breach in western Shandong is even more urgent. He remarked that blocking the Yellow River breach and repairing the Yangtze River dikes can only restore the conditions of the previous year and cannot cure the current year's problems. If the breach is not blocked again, the consequences are unimaginable.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Election of the First President of the Philippines</h3>
<p>The Philippines, the United States' main colony in the Far East, is set to establish an autonomous government on November 15, according to the new Republican Constitution signed by President Roosevelt on March 23 this year and passed by a Philippine plebiscite on May 14. As a result of the presidential election held in the island's thirty-six provinces and the city of Manila, Senate President Quezon and Senator Osmena were elected as the first president and vice president of the autonomous government with the most votes. The Philippines' long-standing struggle for national autonomy has thus embarked on a definite path. The establishment of an independent republic after ten years is within reach. The election of the first president of this transitional period should be welcomed by those who sympathize with the liberation movement of small and weak nations.</p>
<p>However, if we pay closer attention to the future of the Philippines' independence, this election has some noteworthy points. First, Quezon has long enjoyed a reputation as the Speaker of the Philippine Senate, and his contribution to the passage of the Independence Act by the US Congress is not small. His election as president this time is indeed not unexpected. However, it is still questionable whether Quezon's current political power is based on the majority of the Philippine people. His opposition has accused him of being a spokesman for Wall Street, knowing only how to implement the will of the United States to exploit farmers. Looking at Quezon's past political measures and the number of votes Quezon received in his native province of Ayudha during the Philippine general election in June last year, which was less than that of opposition candidate Dimo, it can be seen that these slanders are not without cause. In early May, farmers in four provinces of Luzon, under the leadership of the Sakdal Party, staged a revolt. Tracing the cause, it can also be said to be a reaction to the high-handed tactics of the Quezon Party. The revolutionary government was only a flash in the pan, and these farmers who are dissatisfied with the status quo are still scattered in remote rural areas, posing a hidden danger for the new government in the future. Whether Quezon can have a smooth sailing after taking office as president this time is still difficult to say. Second, the Philippine population is estimated at nearly 14 million. The total number of votes cast in the new constitution vote in May was slightly less than 1.2 million, less than one-tenth of the total population. In this presidential election, the number of voters was even smaller. Even the elected president Quezon only received over 498,000 votes, which is far less than the number of votes in favor of the new constitution. The general Philippine people seem to lack true enthusiasm for the new constitution and this election. The reason is that the new constitution contains reserved clauses: "The Philippines must recognize US sovereignty, and its officials must swear allegiance to the United States." The new political system that can be realized in just over a month is also far from the ideal of most Filipinos who are obsessed with independence.</p>
<p>The United States, with its spirit of people's livelihood, has long felt the pain of being too far away to control the Philippine colony. The reason why it is still unwilling to abandon its sovereignty at this time is that it fears that the Philippines will fall into the arms of Japanese imperialism after leaving the United States. Under the intricate situation of the relationship between Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Pacific, the Philippines' quest for complete independence and autonomy still requires considerable effort in the future, and cannot be achieved by a mere constitution.</p>

<h3>Capital Power Plant Borrows Gengkuan Funds from Construction Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Power Plant is expanding and borrowing £26,000 from Gengkuan Funds. The Construction Committee sent personnel to Shanghai to explain the purpose, stating that the plant needs 4,300 kilowatts of electricity during the day and a maximum of 9,500 kilowatts at night. The main demand at night is for lighting, while the daytime demand is distributed among the Datong Flour Mill, the Waterworks, the Broadcasting Station, the Rice Mill, and other machinery. The plant currently supplies 10,000 kilowatts of electricity, which is barely enough. However, in order to supply 7,000 kilowatts of electricity to the Cement Plant and other places, expansion is necessary. The plant is also in negotiations to supply electricity to the Jiangnan Cement Plant. If this is successful, even with 20,000 kilowatts of power generation in the future, it will still not be enough. The plan is to further expand the equipment and continue to add a 10,000-kilowatt generator, which would have a total capacity of 30,000 kilowatts. At the same time, the electricity supply to Longjie, Tangshan, Jiangning County, and the four suburban districts of Nanjing will be improved. It will cost no less than £36,000. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Geneva Suggestion: Italian Prime Minister Expresses Difficulty in Accepting; Aloisi Returns Home, But Stops Again: Impressions of Pain for the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Power Committee's recommendations are now awaiting responses from Italy and Abyssinia. If both sides can accept them as a basis for discussion, then mediation negotiations will continue, and the question of when to convene a meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council will also be shelved. If one of the parties refuses to accept these recommendations, then the League of Nations Executive Council will meet immediately to decide on future steps. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian representative Aloisi yesterday agreed to French Prime Minister Laval's request to return to Rome to personally persuade Mussolini to accept the Five-Power Committee's recommendations. It is now learned that Aloisi has received news from Rome that Mussolini does not want to accept any advice from Geneva, so he has canceled his trip to Rome today. From this, it can be seen that the Five-Power Committee's report, which contains a peaceful solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, will soon be rejected by Italy. Aloisi's actions have caused a painful impression on the League of Nations, as it is felt that the Italian Prime Minister has no intention of changing his determination to wage war in East Africa.</p>
<h3>Report Content Divided into Three Parts</h3>
<p>Although the committee's report has not yet been released, according to reliable sources, it is divided into three parts: an introduction, a protocol, and a aid plan. The introduction is a review of past events, mentioning Abyssinia's responsibilities regarding the abolition of slavery and the arms trade in 1923, and mentioning the Abyssinian representative's request to the League of Nations to assist Abyssinia in improving its financial, economic, and political status. The protocol contains Abyssinia's general acceptance of various recommendations. The aid plan stipulates that under the auspices of the League of Nations, European advisors will assist in reforming various public services, the most important of which are the gendarmerie, police, and judiciary. The duties of the foreign advisory group include: (1) Eliminating slavery and private arms trade, ensuring the safety of foreign merchants, preventing looting and slave trading; (2) Encouraging the economic exploitation of Abyssinia's resources, allowing foreigners to have mining concessions and opportunities to develop land, seeking greater convenience for foreign trade in industry and commerce, and employing foreign experts to assist in the development of postal services, public works, and transportation and communications; (3) Strictly managing finances, revising tax laws, and studying the possibility of patents related to foreign debt systems.

<h3>Cabinet to Make Final Decision Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian cabinet met yesterday, but no major decisions were made because the report of the League of Nations Five-Power Committee investigating the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has not yet been received. Therefore, it is scheduled to reconvene the cabinet meeting on Saturday and Sunday. According to general opinion, the Five-Power Committee's recommendations cannot resolve this dispute. It is expected that when the cabinet meets on Saturday and Sunday, it will not only reject the Five-Power Committee's recommendations, but also close the door to accepting any mediation proposals from Geneva. As for the question of Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the date of the declaration of war against Abyssinia, how they will be decided may not be announced immediately on Saturday and Sunday. It is generally believed that Italy will not withdraw from the League of Nations unless its position is absolutely unbearable. If the League of Nations votes to impose sanctions or passes a censure motion, as it did in response to Germany's rearmament, then Italy will no longer be able to remain in the League of Nations. Approximately, the outbreak of war will not necessarily be due to a formal declaration of war, but some minor incidents will be the fuse for the outbreak of a major war. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Peaceful Situation Extremely Precarious</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The question of war and peace now depends on what Rome decides. Since Italy's preparations for war, League of Nations figures have felt that the peaceful situation is extremely precarious, and the United Kingdom cannot stand idly by. Looking at the talks published by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and published by the Huangguo Daily Mail this morning, it is clear that Italy's acceptance of the Five-Power Committee's proposal as a basis for negotiations is almost completely hopeless. League of Nations figures attach great importance to the fact that the Italian representative Aloisi has not received instructions from Rome (that is, to return home for instructions). Representatives of certain countries on the small group committee have repeatedly asked Aloisi to truthfully explain to the country's prime minister the public opinion of Geneva towards Italy. In addition, the main figures in charge of international diplomacy are now doing everything possible to ensure that the armed conflicts that may occur between Italy and Abyssinia do not have an impact on Europe. Eden, a member of the British cabinet, met with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval this morning, and the meeting lasted an hour. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ceding Barren Land Bordering on the Ridiculous: Mussolini Expresses Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>(London) Today's Daily Mail published excerpts from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's interview with a reporter from the newspaper, saying that the League of Nations plan is not only unacceptable but also ridiculous. He has not yet received the Five-Power Committee's report, but if what the newspapers are speculating is true, then the proposal seems to be satirical in nature, as if to say that Italy's need for development in East Africa can be met by ceding a pair of barren areas, a salty land and a right land, to Italy. Does the Five-Power Committee think he is a collector of barren land? (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Urge Italy to Accept Reconciliation, Otherwise Serious Consequences Will Result</h3>
<p>(Paris) In view of Britain's tough attitude, French newspapers tend to warn Mussolini, urging him to accept the League of Nations' proposals and not to go to extremes in order to avoid disrupting the peace. The Paris Echo commented on the Five-Power Committee's recommendations, saying that Britain clearly only allows Italy to obtain economic rights, while Mussolini demands freedom of military action. However, the newspaper believes that it is beneficial for Mr. to accept the Geneva proposals in principle, because the actions of the British navy in the Mediterranean have already indicated that if Italy insists on the expedition, there is a risk of serious development. If Mussolini can accept reconciliation, it will be a great contribution to peace, and France will do its best to mediate for Italy. As for the actions of the British Navy that have complicated the whole problem, a Parisien reporter in Geneva said that a great power such as Italy should not lose its national status if it can accept the unexpectedly generous proposals from Geneva. On the contrary, acceptance will definitely increase Italy's reputation. (19th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Britain, France, and Other Countries Considering Sanctions Against Italy; Negotiations Have Reached a Considerable Degree</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned today that Britain, France, and other countries are considering a type of "gradual" sanctions against Italy. The Associated Press learned from well-informed sources that Mussolini's rejection of the League of Nations' proposals is inevitable. Discussions on taking sanctions are now at a considerable level. The plan is as follows: (1) Member states of the League of Nations will unanimously withdraw their ambassadors and ministers from Italy; (2) Implement financial and economic boycotts; (3) Gradually prohibit exports to Italy to achieve a complete economic blockade and use the navies of various countries to enforce it. It is now learned that the Five-Power Committee is recommending the establishment of a five-person supervisory system, with each person controlling one of Abyssinia's five departments of administration, police, finance, justice, and health. This supervisory system will be overseen by a representative of the League of Nations as the director-general. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Internal Disagreements Within the British Labour Party on Sanctions; Ponsonby Resigns as Labour Leader; Cripps Also Resigns from Executive Committee</h3>
<p>(London) The attitudes of people in the Labour Party towards the Italian-Abyssinian issue are not compatible, so a serious split has occurred. Lord Ponsonby, the leader of the Labour Party in the House of Lords, resigned from his position as Labour leader today. Shortly after, it was reported that Sir Stafford Cripps of the Labour Party National Executive Committee also resigned because he disagreed with the policy of other executive committee members supporting the government's foreign policy, and because he did not want his own views to hinder the work of the party. Ponsonby stated that he had very different opinions from those on important foreign affairs, and the Labour Party's attitude towards the international difficult situation had made it impossible for him to continue to serve the party. He has always held the view that peace cannot be achieved by force. It is expected that there will soon be further developments in disagreements within the Labour Party, and the Party Executive Committee is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to deal with the differing opinions of the leaders.

<h3>Pessimistic Situation in Italy and Abyssinia; War Almost Inevitable; Abyssinia Actively Preparing for War; Men and Women Alike Share Common Enmity</h3>
<p>According to the Abyssinian government, diplomatic negotiations in Geneva will ultimately fail, and the outbreak of war is only a matter of days. The Italian army's advance from the Eritrean side will also take at most a few weeks. It is expected here that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will definitely reject the recommendations of the League of Nations Five-Power Committee, so even if Abyssinia is now willing to accept, it will not be able to avoid war. The second act of the League of Nations will be sanctions against Italy, but this action will inevitably be met with armed resistance from Italy. Abyssinia continues to carry out its war preparations. The small amount of military supplies transported by camel teams from Somalia, Kenya, Sudan, and the Belgian Congo is not enough for guerrilla warfare. The Abyssinian Emperor hopes that the ban on arms to Abyssinia will be lifted as soon as possible so that it can obtain sufficient military supplies before Italy and Abyssinia go to war. The Abyssinian Emperor is now asking foreign newspaper reporters to accompany his headquarters. The whereabouts of the Abyssinian Emperor are unknown, but it is likely that the Abyssinian Emperor will leave both capitals as soon as the war breaks out. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>The people of the ancient country of Abyssinia have shown a patriotic sincerity that is difficult to describe in words because the war is about to break out. Soldiers are prepared to sacrifice their lives on the battlefield, and women and children are doing their best for the country, second only to the soldiers. This morning, there were 50 children in the capital, the oldest of whom was a little over eight years old. Most of them were grandchildren of heroes of Aduwa (where the Abyssinian army defeated the Italian army in 1896). They wore yellow uniforms, carried small wooden rifles on their shoulders, and were led by a military band, marching in step through the city. The sight was awe-inspiring. When asked questions, the children said that their fathers had gone to the front line, and that they would take care of their mothers and sisters at home in their fathers' absence, waiting to grow up and join the army. Representatives of 1,500 female members of the Abyssinian Patriotic Association met with the Abyssinian Empress today and wished to use their savings to support 7,500 officers and soldiers. They have prepared a large amount of jerky rations to be transported to the army. The association's provincial branches have also prepared rations to supply the local troops. After the Empress accepted the representatives' contributions, she fulfilled her last appointment in the capital for a long time before tearfully saying goodbye to the King. The scene at the time was extremely tragic, because it was unknown when they would be able to meet again. The Empress then took her young son by special train to Bijofitu Town, two hours away from the capital, and temporarily resided in a quiet inn to observe the changes in the situation. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>The Abyssinian government is now planning to prohibit foreign residents from traveling freely in the interior of Abyssinia, except for those who have been approved by the Abyssinian Emperor. The residents of the Abyssinian capital are quite calm. The general public believes that the war will not break out immediately because the roads in East Africa are not suitable for military operations, and the Italian army may not be able to attack Abyssinia immediately. Official sources believe that Italy's military preparations for the invasion of Abyssinia do not seem to be complete, and it is hoped that the war will not occur before the beginning of December. Also, people here were quite excited to hear the news of the movements of the British naval fleets in the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans. (18th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>The Abyssinian government has now issued the necessary instructions to four Italian consuls stationed on the border to withdraw from Abyssinia. The instructions stated that the Italian consuls must follow the route designated by the Abyssinian government to come to the Abyssinian capital and must not go directly to Eritrea or Italian Somaliland. The Abyssinian government also announced that if war breaks out between Italy and Abyssinia, it cannot guarantee respect for the Italian consuls' homes. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Eleven former Belgian army officers recently arrived in the Abyssinian capital as a group and are serving in the Abyssinian army. Today, a spokesman for the group declared that they will fight for Abyssinia. They have retired from the Belgian army. If the Belgian authorities order them to return home, they will not comply. It is now believed that if Italy and Abyssinia actually go to war, the Belgian government military mission stationed in Abyssinia will leave Abyssinia and return home. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Coping with Future Emergencies: British Fleet Concentrates in Mediterranean; U.S. Considers Shifting to the Atlantic to Protect Freedom of Maritime Trade</h3>
<p>(London) Today's Mediterranean Sea may become a site for unprecedented naval battles in history. The British Navy, dispatched from its homeland and recalled from China and other locations, is now concentrating in this ancient sea. This includes everything from torpedo boats to large battleships. The Italian Navy may defend both sides of the Italian Peninsula, while heavily armed forces will guard the coastal areas of Africa and Europe. The air force has begun demonstrations in the sky. Because the Mediterranean is a long and narrow inland sea, bombing by aircraft, coastal artillery fire, and the use of cruisers and submarines will all be applied during naval battles. Although Britain and Italy are urgently preparing for war, Turkey, Greece, and Egypt are also urgently seeking self-defense. A reporter from the Associated Press has learned that twelve Italian submarines have already passed through the Suez Canal. (National Telegram, September 18)</p>
<p>(London) According to officials, the British fleet stationed in the Mediterranean is now stocked with enough food, fuel, and ammunition to last three months. If the Admiralty decides to completely evacuate the residents of Malta to avoid enemy bombing, the British Mediterranean Fleet will concentrate in the Egyptian port of Alexandria and the Palestinian port of Haifa. However, British newspapers barely mention a word about the British Navy's preparations. In addition, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced in Washington that he plans to transfer some warships from the U.S. Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic to protect freedom of trade in the event of war. Swanson's statement is likely to further complicate the current situation. (Havas Dispatch, September 18)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson, when meeting with reporters today, answered reporters' questions, saying that the actions of the American fleet in the event of war across the Atlantic have never been considered. If it is necessary to transfer part of the fleet to the Atlantic, the government will consider this issue to maintain neutrality and prevent interference with shipping lanes. The United States hopes that war will not occur, but if a conflict arises between Italy and Abyssinia, the U.S. Navy will prepare to move warships from the Pacific to the Atlantic to protect American shipping.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance to Establish Financial Attaché in China, Planned for Implementation Next Year, Preparing for Investment and Developing Trade</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, Sino-Japanese relations have improved, and the Chinese market occupies an important position in Japanese economic relations. However, all economic work related to China is carried out by diplomatic missions stationed in China. A representative organization to handle the most necessary financial issues in the future does not yet exist. To eliminate this inconvenience, the Ministry of Finance has decided to revive the system of financial attachés to China, which was abolished during the time of Finance Minister Inoue. It is expected to be implemented next year and is actively preparing. The mission of the former financial attaché to China was to recover loans to China, but now the situation has completely changed. Preparation for investment in China and the development of trade with China are essential. Therefore, the main purpose of establishing the new financial attaché is to carry out these missions.

<h3>Roosevelt Appoints MacArthur as Military Advisor to the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Army Chief of Staff MacArthur was instructed by President Roosevelt today to be appointed as a military advisor to the new government of the Philippines. MacArthur's acceptance of this position was expected. Leaders of the Philippines invited MacArthur to Manila a month ago to assist the Philippines in developing its army after the establishment of the autonomous government in mid-November. At that time, MacArthur did not immediately respond. It was not until after discussing the matter with the President last week that he decided to accept. However, the formal announcement will be made after the results of the Philippine general election are revealed. MacArthur served as commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines from 1903 to 1904 and was wounded twice during the European War. (National Telegram, September 18)</p>

<h3>Asia Unrepresented; League of Nations Political Council Structure Unsound</h3>
<p>Believing All Nations Recognize Our Demand as Reasonable and Will Take Steps to Realize It: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson's Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding China's request to join the League of Nations Council, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued the following statement on the 19th: "The Chinese government and people deeply believe that, based on the universality of the League of Nations, the request to specially establish a seat in the Council is extremely reasonable. The organization of League of Nations members and their various parts has never had regional boundaries, and its scope of action is global in nature. This universal characteristic is what binds the world together as a large organization to advance toward peace, justice, fidelity, and mutual understanding. But the most regrettable thing is that, according to the current facts, the largest continent on Earth has no representation in the Council. For most of the year, when the General Assembly is not in session, no Asian country participates in the world events discussed and handled by the League of Nations. Since the League of Nations' institutions lack universality, the solidity of its entire structure is also shaken. The Chinese government deeply believes that all member states of the League of Nations fully recognize the reasonableness of China's request for a seat in the Council and will take steps to ensure that the Far East can effectively participate in this international conference. This is not only for China's sake, but also for the sake of the League of Nations itself." (Central News Agency Dispatch, September 19)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Political Committee Meeting to Discuss Mandate Issues; Norwegian Representative Presents Work Report; Japan Decides to Send Ito to Attend, Explaining the Situation of Mandated Islands</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Political Committee convened a meeting today to discuss mandate issues. The Norwegian rapporteur reported on the progress of the Mandates Commission's work. The South African Union representative, De Waard, reaffirmed his declaration regarding the Mandates Commission, clarifying the South African government's attitude towards the proposal to incorporate the mandated territory of Southwest Africa into the South African Union, stating that the report of the special investigation committee has been submitted to the South African government and will be carefully studied by the South African government, but does not want to make any decision before the Mandates Commission approves the report. The representatives of France, Lithuania, Poland, and Switzerland suggested increasing the quota for Jewish immigration when debating the Palestine report, saying that the economic situation there allows for this higher quota. The British representative said that Britain must adopt an extremely reserved attitude towards this suggestion, because although the economic situation in Palestine is good, this issue is hindered by various difficulties. (National Telegram, September 18)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the Sixth Political Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly on the 18th, the Norwegian representative, Lange, mentioned the issue of Japan establishing ports in the South Pacific Islands, as well as the issue of discriminatory treatment of Japanese goods in the British and French mandated territories of Palestine and Syria, proposing to hear the opinions of the Japanese government and deciding to convene the Mandates Commission in mid-October, requesting Japanese representatives to attend and explain. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then decided to send Ito, the Minister to Poland, to Geneva to attend the committee. The Japanese government's response policy is as follows: (1) "South Pacific Islands Port Issue": The establishment of ports in the South Pacific Islands is entirely due to economic necessity, so it has no military nature. This point is detailed in the annual report on mandated territories submitted by the Japanese government to the League of Nations. (2) "Equal Treatment in Trade" (A) Japan is one of the major Allied and Associated Powers, and its authority over mandated territories is not lost due to its withdrawal from the League of Nations. However, even though Japan is not a member of the League of Nations, it should enjoy equal treatment in trade in other mandated territories. (B) Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant on mandated territories does not recognize discriminatory treatment for non-member countries, and the relationship between non-member countries and the mandated territories should be freely agreed upon between those two countries, without interference from the League of Nations. (C) If the League of Nations openly interferes with smooth international trade relations and recognizes discriminatory treatment for favored nations, it would be contrary to the spirit of the League of Nations.

China is currently carrying out large-scale construction work and urgently needs specialized technical personnel. An academic work advisory office has been established in Nanjing to introduce specialized personnel, which is very beneficial.

<h3>U.S. Treasury Secretary Travels to Europe, France Schedules Meeting, U.S. Conducts Reciprocal Trade Agreement Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is about to travel to Europe. French Finance Minister Liénart has requested that he schedule a meeting.

It is generally believed that signs of improved international trade relations can be seen in this move, and that various commercial obstacles may be lifted as a result. Regarding this, the speech given by French Minister of Commerce Ponley at the Finance and Economics Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly on the 17th of this month can be compared. Ponley advocated stabilizing international exchange rates and reducing tariff barriers between countries. (Havas Dispatch, September 18)</p>

President Roosevelt has formally announced that this deadline will be extended to December 31, and has instructed the Treasury Department to this effect. The President's move is to allow trade agreement negotiations to proceed smoothly. (Havas Dispatch, September 18)</p>

Recently, the China Industrial Federation sent Qian Chengxu and manufacturer representatives Gu Xinyi and Chen Ziyi to Cangzhou Hotel to meet with Central Committee member Huang Jilu, requesting mediation.

<p>Petitioning for Exemption of Stamp Duty on Checks</p>

However, in order to comply with the law, the Banking Association specially resolved at its last Executive Committee meeting to continue to affix stamps as required during the period when the petition has not been approved. Therefore, the stamp duty issue has not been resolved. The Banking Association recently held a meeting and decided to send Executive Committee member Wang Zhixin to Beijing to petition.

<p>China Industrial Foreign Trade Association</p>
<p>Held Banquet for Commissioner Hou the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Director Chen Gongbo Personally Attended to Give Instructions</p>
<p>Hou Ding Will Depart for the Netherlands Early Next Month</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Chinese expatriates in the Netherlands organized the "Special Committee for Promoting Sino-Dutch Trade by Overseas Chinese in the Netherlands Indies" to develop Sino-Dutch trade and telegraphed the ministry, requesting the selection and dispatch of experts to preside over it. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, based on the situation, appointed Hou Houji, a statistics commissioner from the International Trade Bureau, to go. The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, considering that Mr. Hou's trip is of great importance to the development of foreign trade, took advantage of a dinner party for members of the association and held a banquet at Jinlong Restaurant on Xizang Road at 7 p.m. the night before last. More than 40 people, including factory representatives of the association's members, attended. Chen Gongbo, the Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, personally attended to give instructions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>During the dinner, Zhang Huikang, the standing committee member and chairman of the association, reported, stating that today is a banquet for Commissioner Hou Houji, who has been specially dispatched to the Netherlands, and also the second dinner party for members of the association. We are very honored to have Director Chen, Director He, and all the guests present. The association has been established for more than three months. Although there have been no amazing achievements, we can still be content. In the future, we will follow the plan to seek the development of foreign trade. The biggest key to China's current poverty is the issue of trade deficits. The way to solve this problem can be divided into two aspects: one is to reduce imports, and the other is to increase exports. In the past, the association focused on reducing imports, but this is not a fundamental solution and is not easy to implement. In the future, the association will focus on increasing exports and opening up overseas markets to seek production and sales to promote the development of national goods. Director Chen is very concerned about national goods and industry. When he went to Nanyang last time, he conducted investigations for the national goods industry and negotiated everything to give overseas Chinese and foreigners a new understanding of national goods. This time, sending Commissioner Hou to the Netherlands will further promote the development of foreign trade.</p>
<p>Director's Instructions</p>
<p>Then, Director Chen gave instructions, stating that he is very grateful for the invitation to attend. Just now, the chairman reported that future work will focus on increasing exports. Reducing trade deficits and increasing exports have been my hope for many years. I have been planning for nothing else. However, reducing trade deficits should start with the development of domestic industries. The import of agricultural products accounts for a quarter of China's imports. It is a painful phenomenon that an agricultural country needs so many foreign agricultural products. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has formulated detailed plans for domestically needed agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and cotton, and is currently implementing them. It is expected that after a certain number of years, we will achieve self-sufficiency. Moreover, we not only hope to be self-sufficient, but also hope to use our strength to develop foreign trade. The development of domestic industry and the promotion of overseas markets will help alleviate the economic crisis. When I went to Nanyang last time, I had the mission of opening up markets for domestic industries. Although it was only two months in Nanyang, I gained a lot, and what is even more encouraging is the patriotism of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang, who are also working hard to promote national goods. I visited various national goods exhibition halls there. Although there were many exhibits, they were all old-fashioned goods from more than 20 years ago. When asked why they did not display the new industrial products made in China, they replied that they did not know what new products there were in China and that there was no reply to their letters. Therefore, they could not list them. This phenomenon is a great regret. The purpose of your association is to assist the government and develop foreign trade. In the future, you must pay attention to these places. In addition, I have three hopes for your association: (1) I hope that you will develop from an investigative and liaison organization to a unified executive body. Economic warfare is commodity warfare. If there is no organization with an overall structure and plan to seek control, then everyone will act on their own, the strength will be small, and the failure will be inevitable. Japan's foreign trade always has an overall organization, and there are banks such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui to back it up, so the progress is smooth and the development is rapid. China has neither such a great bank nor an organization, so it is lagging behind and failing everywhere. The reasons for the failure of overseas Chinese today are mostly similar. (2) I hope that the goods manufactured by your association's factories must be standardized as much as possible, so-called cheap and good quality. In recent years, Chinese manufacturers who have not developed their business have certainly cut corners, but those who have developed their business have cut corners even more, resulting in inferior goods, declining credibility, and the loss of the market. The decline of silk and tea can be a lesson. Therefore, standardizing goods is a prerequisite for China's industry to save itself. (3) I hope that when your association investigates the production and sales situation, it will also pay attention to the local national conditions and customs to seek adaptation. For example, the Philippines levies import duties on toothbrushes based on weight, regardless of the number of pieces. A certain number of pounds are taxed. Chinese toothbrush handles are very heavy, while Japanese toothbrushes are very light and skillful. If Chinese and Japanese toothbrushes are shipped to the area at the same time, China can import 1,000, while Japan can import 1,300. The cost is lighter, and the selling price is also different. Chinese goods cannot compete with Japanese goods. In addition, Filipinos like to wear new clothes, and the quality does not have to be very particular, but the patterns may as well be new. If manufacturers focus on durability and fine processing, it will not only be unprofitable, but also a failure. This is just an example and not entirely the case. I hope you will pay attention to improvements at all times.</p>
<p>Mr. Hou's Reply</p>
<p>After Director Chen finished his instructions, Commissioner Hou replied, stating that he has shallow knowledge and is very ashamed to be dispatched to the Netherlands Indies this time to preside over Sino-Dutch trade. However, he will never give up and will do his best to seek development for domestic industries, so that foreign nations can recognize the progress of China's new industries, so as not to fail his mission. At the same time, he hopes that the members of the association will give guidance and convenience, which will be greatly appreciated. When the Dagong News Agency reporter asked Mr. Hou about the date of departure for the Netherlands, he replied that it will take time to investigate the details of domestic industries and import and export businesses. Once the investigation is completed, he can leave as soon as he receives a telegram from the Netherlands Indies. The departure date is about early next month.</p>

I hope that all my fellow writers will follow suit, then literary disaster relief will also be a good story. (Below omitted) Cheng Xisen, August 31.</p>

<p>Flood Relief Association Person in Charge Talks</p>
<p>Joint Efforts from Government and Public to Save Disaster</p>
<p>Chief Investigator Zha Zhen Has Already Left</p>
<p>Funds from All Sides Will Be Distributed in a Unified Manner</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a reporter interviewed a person in charge of the Shanghai Fund-raising Disaster Relief Association yesterday to talk about the situation of joint efforts from the government and the public to provide relief for the floods in various provinces this year. The floods in various provinces this year are severe. Chairman Chiang, President Wang, Vice President Sun, and all the central officials are extremely concerned. All the measures for governance are being actively implemented. Vice President Kong and Chairman Xu of the Central Relief Committee have also personally visited the disaster areas to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the disaster situation. Currently, Chairman Xu will go to the Subei area to inspect yesterday (the 18th) and bring tens of thousands of yuan in relief funds for urgent distribution. The local authorities in various provinces are doing their best to prevent and rescue. Mayor Wu of this city and leaders from all walks of life, sympathizing with the disaster victims, have launched this association to raise funds for relief. It can be seen that the government and the public are of one mind to save this catastrophe, which is comforting to the disaster victims. Now, the disaster areas are in urgent need of relief, and rescue is essential. This association has borrowed 500,000 yuan in relief funds from the banking community and allocated them to the disaster areas of various provinces for relief. The details have been repeatedly recorded in various newspapers. Overseas Chinese, caring for their motherland and enthusiastically providing relief, have repeatedly remitted donations back to China, which are transferred by the Diplomatic Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Central Relief Committee for receipt and distribution. Because they are acting on orders from the Executive Yuan, all donations from overseas Chinese are handed over to the Central Relief Committee for unified distribution. After receiving the donations, the committee immediately allocates them to the governments of the affected provinces for distribution in the disaster areas. On the one hand, they are specially rewarded according to regulations, and on the other hand, they are announced at all levels for the record. Because the Relief Committee is the government's agency for coordinating national relief efforts. As for fund-raising, it is the responsibility of this association to coordinate relief efforts. The Central Relief Committee is a social disaster relief organization, and the government Relief Committee is a government relief agency. There is a difference in position and purpose, but the goals are the same. They work together in coordination. A news report in yesterday's newspaper stated that the Executive Yuan issued an order that all relief funds nationwide should be concentrated in the Shanghai Relief Association for distribution. This association has not received this order and has not heard of this proposal. It may be because the Executive Yuan has ordered that donations from overseas Chinese be handed over to the Central Relief Committee for distribution and this was misinterpreted.</p>
<p>It is also heard that Lu Bohong and other representatives sent by the Flood Relief Association to various provinces have already departed. All relief funds have also been remitted by the Shanghai Central Bank to the central branches of various provinces, specifying that they should be withdrawn and distributed by the chairmen of the provincial governments or the chairmen of the flood relief departments, together with the investigation and relief representatives sent by the association. The relief methods and the locations for urgent relief should be determined by joint meetings of the provincial government, provincial relief agencies, and local public organizations and gentry, and handled in accordance with the association's outline for investigation and urgent relief, ensuring that they are used for emergency relief, that funds are not wasted, and that the results are practical. At present, the weather is getting cooler, and the disaster areas have suffered from cold and famine, and epidemics are rampant. The association has prepared a large number of relief clothing and medicines to be transported to the investigation and relief personnel for distribution. As for the relief funds this time, in order to save money, the staff are all volunteers. Lu Bohong, the investigation and relief representative in Shandong, handled the investigation and distribution of relief funds, amounting to about 200,000 yuan, and only received 1,000 yuan from the association for office expenses. His dedication and hard work are commendable, and it also shows the association's prudence in handling public funds. The internal work of the association is extremely intense, and they work from morning to night every day without rest. Recently, due to the clothing, medicine, and printing of relief tickets, they often work overnight. It is said that the directors and secretaries of each group are purely volunteers, and the secretaries of each group have the qualifications and abilities of state officials and work more than ten hours a day. The living expenses they receive are very small, ranging from 30 to 20 yuan for most, and only 15 yuan for a few. They are all able to be diligent and cautious in public service, be practical and hardworking, serve the disaster victims, and have a spirit of sacrifice. It is appropriate that the association can be trusted by the society.</p>

<p>Due to the Turmoil in Italy and Abyssinia, Insurance Companies in This Port Have Increased War Risk Premiums</p>
<p>More Than 40 Companies, Including Yangtze, Have Implemented It</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the Italo-Abyssinian conflict is becoming increasingly serious, and the danger of sea vessels passing through the Mediterranean is extremely high. Insurance companies and Lloyd's of London resolved on the 16th to cancel the war risk clauses in all open contracts, sign new war risk contracts, and charge special fees (see Reuters report on the 16th). A Datong News Agency reporter learned yesterday morning that insurance companies in this port, including Yangtze, Baoding, Xinfu, Huaan, Zhaotai, New World, Renjihe, and more than 40 others, increased the war risk premium from 25 cents per 1,000 yuan of insurance premium from the day before yesterday. Since the day before yesterday, for goods insured that must pass through the Mediterranean, an additional 50 cents per 1,000 yuan has been charged. By yesterday morning, it had risen tenfold compared to normal, to 2.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Based on the international situation and the military actions of various countries in the Mediterranean, there will be extreme fluctuations.</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing Talks About the Reasons for High Flour Prices</p>
<p>Caused by Lack of Raw Materials</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the flour market in China has recently experienced high prices due to a shortage of raw materials, which has a significant impact on people's food supply. According to Rong Zongjing, a flour industry magnate, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the recent floods in various provinces have reduced the supply of wheat raw materials. Foreign raw materials are also too expensive, and the cost is too high, which is not cost-effective. In addition, the Italo-Abyssinian conflict in Europe is very tense, and no country is exporting goods. Therefore, the price of flour in China is rising step by step. The factory I operate will be completely shut down at the end of this month due to a lack of raw materials. Flour is an indispensable item in people's food supply.

<p>Moller Line's Mabel Moller Ran Aground in Japan and Sought Help</p>
<p>Extent of Damage Unknown</p>
<p>The Mabel Moller, 2,629 tons, of the Moller &amp; Co. in this port, is an oceangoing vessel without passenger accommodations. It was chartered to a Japanese company a month ago to operate the Vladivostok-Japan line, specializing in the transportation of goods between the two countries. After the ship was chartered, it was managed by the Japanese company and sailed directly between Japan and Vladivostok. The route did not go to Shanghai, so the shipping company could not know the details of its voyage.</p>
<p>Ran Aground in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>The Mabel Moller was carrying cargo from Vladivostok to Japan. At about 11 p.m. on the 18th of this month, the ship suddenly ran aground on a reef in the Soya Strait in Hokkaido, Japan. The impact was heavy, and the hull seemed to have entered the reef. The hull was broken, and seawater had entered all the cabins. The captain, Farfter, had no choice but to send an SOS wireless distress signal to await rescue.</p>
<p>Damage Unknown</p>
<p>A reporter asked the shipping company about everything. According to reports, the ship has now been chartered to a Japanese company, and everything related to the accident and rescue is handled by the Japanese. As for how to deal with this situation, it is up to them to decide. As for the damage to the cargo, the details are not yet known.</p>

<p>International Wireless Telephone to Open on New Year's Eve Midnight</p>
<p>China and Japan to Talk in Mid-November</p>
<p>Domestic Calls to Be Available on Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Ministry of Communications' International Telecommunications Bureau has completed the trial operation of the international and domestic wireless telephone stations. It is now continuing to transfer connections to the Zhabei and concession areas for trial operation. Other preparatory procedures have been largely completed, and contracts are being negotiated with various countries. In addition to the domestic part, which is scheduled to be officially opened on the Double Tenth Festival, the international part, China and Japan, will begin trial operation on November 1. The rest of the countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Italy, and the Philippines, are all scheduled to be opened at midnight on New Year's Eve this year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic Calls Scheduled for Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>In May of this year, the Ministry of Communications consulted with Guangdong Province and decided to cooperate in establishing long-distance wireless telephones between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan. The Shanghai project is being handled by the International Telecommunications Bureau. In addition to the Hankou line, which has been suspended due to the floods, the Shanghai Zhenru General Station has been completed and the equipment has been installed. The Guangdong project was also completed at the beginning of the month. The Guangdong Commissioner Deng Zongyao, who is responsible for handling the project, came to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Communications and discuss the call procedures. Deng has now returned to Guangdong, so Shanghai and Guangdong are scheduled to hold trial calls next Monday, and officially open calls at midnight on October 10. Depending on the results, it will be gradually extended to Qingdao, Tianjin, Peiping, and other cities.</p>
<p>China and Japan to Begin in November</p>
<p>The wireless telephones between China and Japan, after the representative of the Japanese Ministry of Communications, Arakawa, came to Shanghai to contact the International Telecommunications Bureau, were originally scheduled to open calls on September 15. However, due to insufficient preparation, it could not be realized as scheduled. Arakawa has now returned to Japan to report. According to Director Wen, speaking to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, calls can be opened on November 1. Regarding the call prices, the Ministry of Communications is now formulating fee standards, imitating the domestic long-distance telephone precedents. Each call is calculated by time, and the price must be higher than that of wireless telegraphs. It is expected that after the official opening of calls in the future, the transmission of political and diplomatic news between China and Japan will be faster.</p>
<p>United Kingdom, United States, and Other Countries to Open on New Year's Eve</p>
<p>As for the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Italy, the Philippines, and other countries, the results have been very good since the International Radio Station began trial operation. The trial operation has now been completed, and the bureau is now transferring connections to Zhabei and the concession areas for trial operation. In the future, it is also planned to gradually transfer connections to Nanjing, Peiping, Jiangxi, and other places. In the future, all parts of the country will be able to directly talk to various countries, so during the trial operation period, it is necessary to test them one by one to achieve perfection. As for the exact date of the calls, according to Director Wen, speaking to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the vice president of the Shanghai Telephone Company, Xue, has gone to the United States to contact and sign preliminary call contracts with the United States. The Philippines is directly negotiating with the bureau, while the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, and Germany are directly handled by the Ministry of Communications. It is expected that all will be opened at midnight on New Year's Eve this year.</p>

<p>The City Rent Reduction Committee Will Launch a General Rent Reduction Mobilization Tomorrow</p>
<p>Post Banners in Various Districts to Expand Publicity</p>
<p>Submit to Various Courts to Suspend Rent Enforcement</p>
<p>The City Rent Reduction Committee believes that the rent reduction issue has been delayed until now without a concrete solution. The committee's propaganda section has drafted expanded propaganda methods and decided to launch a general rent reduction mobilization from tomorrow to the end of the month to promote social attention. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Start Mobilization and Conduct District Propaganda</p>
<p>The citywide rent reduction movement will be launched tomorrow. The City Rent Reduction Committee will print a large number of propaganda slogans and post them in various districts. The First Self-Digging Graves Citizen United Association will notify its district branches to unite with various shops during this mobilization period to make a unified statement on the rent reduction movement. It is also scheduled that the City Rent Reduction Committee will convene a joint meeting of representatives from various district rent reduction branches in the city on the 25th of this month to discuss ways to promote rent reduction in order to revive the city and avert future crises. At the same time, a survey form will be printed and distributed to citizen branch committees and rent reduction branches in various districts for investigation to prepare for future negotiations.</p>
<p>Expand Petition and Clearly Define Rent Reduction</p>
<p>After the general mobilization begins, in order to request the Party and government agencies to clearly define rent reduction standards, it has been decided to hold an expanded petition to various agencies such as the City Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Council. When the Sixth Plenary Session opens, representatives will go to Beijing to petition the conference, the Central Party Department, the Central Political Council, the National Government Executive Yuan, and other agencies to request that they issue rent reduction measures in accordance with the capital Anqing and other places to determine rent reduction standards for compliance. The petition representatives will be selected at the district representatives' meeting on the 25th of this month. As for the travel expenses to Beijing, the representatives will find ways to raise funds themselves and will not solicit donations from outside.</p>
<p>Submit to Various Courts to Suspend Enforcement</p>
<p>The committee submitted to various courts in the city yesterday, stating that since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's vitality has been greatly damaged, industry and commerce have declined, and all industries have been in recession, becoming increasingly serious. Under the extreme pressure of this economic crisis, unemployed and homeless people are wandering on the streets, and shops are closing, which is visible everywhere. Although food and clothing are essential to life, they can be adjusted or reduced by individual ability due to falling prices. However, housing is a problem, as there is no way to reduce or relocate. The rent is extraordinarily high, far exceeding its value. Landlords oppress people, making life unbearable. Although the capital has explicitly ordered rent reduction, Shanghai has not yet implemented it. It is known that the rent reduction movement has spread throughout Shanghai, indicating that rent reduction has become the demand of all citizens. However, since the implementation, it has been more than a year. Some landlords who understand the overall situation have voluntarily reduced rent, but most landlords disregard the economy and people's livelihood, using the law as a shield. They also use false attachments and false executions as a tool to oppress rent reduction. According to Article 442 of the Civil Code, the parties may petition the court to increase or decrease the rent of leased property due to the increase or decrease in its value. Although there is no fixed method for calculating house prices, it is an undeniable fact that the market is currently sluggish, with empty houses in bustling areas and no one interested. Advertisements for rent reduction appear in newspapers every day, and real estate mortgages are reduced by banks and money shops to 60% to 70%, which is clear evidence of its declining value. Therefore, the current rent reduction request is based on facts and complies with legal principles. In addition, the essential elements for applying for false attachments and false executions in civil litigation are that the landlord fabricates accusations against the tenant for requesting rent reduction, which is intentional. However, the court is deceived by them and has repeatedly sent personnel to seal and evict tenants, causing citizens to suspect that the law is designed for landlords. When cash is provided and the seal is restored, they have suffered great losses. Before the rent dispute is resolved, if the tenant can provide evidence of rent deposit in the bank, it means that they are requesting rent reduction and not intentionally owing rent, that is, rejecting the landlord's request. For the declaration of false attachments, temporarily suspend it to prevent landlords from deceiving and oppressing, and let tenants have hope of recovery. The association will be grateful. Therefore, we specially submit this request, asking your court to examine and implement it. The utmost urgency is awaited. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court, the Each Special District Local Court, the First Special District Local Court.</p>

As Shanghai is the host city for this year's National Games, everything must be grand and beautiful. Therefore, we solicited design proposals from various stores. After reviewing the results, we found that the Standard Sports Equipment Company's samples, quality, color, and style were all suitable. It has now been decided to entrust the company with the manufacturing of the uniforms.</p>

<p>(Xiamen Correspondence) The opening ceremony of the Fifth Fujian Provincial Games of the 24th year of the Republic of China was held at 10:00 AM on September 11th at the Xiamen Zhongshan Park Stadium. Chairman Zheng Zhenwen presided over the ceremony, and Vice Chairman Wang Guipan reported on the preparations. Honorary Chairman Jiang Dingwen personally delivered a speech.

Nan'an arrived but did not participate. In total, there were 15 units and 356 athletes (male and female). Competitions began on the afternoon of September 11th and ended on the evening of the 14th. The closing ceremony was held on the 15th. In the men's division, Xiamen won championships in track events, all-around, soccer, basketball, tennis, baseball, and swimming, with a total score of 34, ranking first and winning the men's championship. Minhou won the volleyball championship, with a total score of 14, ranking second. Tongan's total score ranked third, and Putian won the field event championship, with a total score of 8, ranking fourth. In the women's division, Xiamen won five championships in basketball, volleyball, tennis, softball, and swimming, with a total score of 23, ranking first and winning the women's championship. Minhou's total score ranked second, Putian won the track and field championship, with a total score of 5, ranking third, and Jinjiang ranked fourth with 2 points. Xiamen won 12 championships in men's and women's events and won the overall championship of this year's games. In men's field events, Putian ranked first with 61 points, Xiamen ranked second with 54 points, Minhou ranked third with 28 points, and Tongan ranked fourth with 6 points. In track events, Xiamen ranked first with 88 points, while Minhou, Tongan, and Putian all had 23 points. The ranking was determined by the number of first, second, third, and fourth-place finishes, with Minhou second, Tongan third, and Putian fourth. In the all-around, Xiamen ranked first with 28 points, Putian second with 27 points, Minhou third with 14 points, and Jinjiang fourth with 6 points. In track and field individual scores, Wu Jinqi of Putian ranked first for men with 26 points, and Xu Meiying of Putian ranked first for women with 28 points. The focus of this year's games was on track and field, all-around, and men's and women's swimming. In ball sports, the women's volleyball competition between Xiamen and Minhou was extremely fierce, with Xiamen winning 2-1. Minhou's men's and women's volleyball teams are well-known nationally. They have held the provincial volleyball championship for many years, but this year they lost to Xiamen, which was unexpected. The fierce battle showed that they were evenly matched. Apart from this, the soccer, men's and women's basketball, and men's tennis skills of other counties were too poor, and Xiamen easily won. In women's tennis and softball, and men's baseball, no one responded to the challenge, and Xiamen won without competition. In the men's volleyball championship, Minhou defeated Xiamen in straight sets, and their skills were not too far apart. Minhou still maintained its strong presence in volleyball. The results of this year's track and field, all-around, and men's and women's swimming events and the comparison with provincial records are listed on the left.</p>

<p>In summary, except for two field events and four women's track events that broke records, the all-around track events have deteriorated. Men's swimming broke four records out of six events, and women's swimming broke all four records. However, among the fourteen records broken, Chen Cuifang and Tang Ruiyuan tied in the women's high jump with a score of 1.35, which is only 0.005 meters short of the national record of 1.355 meters. The remaining records are far from the national records. Chen Cuifang of Xiamen is the most promising athlete to be selected for the National Games in this provincial competition. According to Chen and teachers at Cizin Girls' School, Chen only practiced high jump for one week, and this result was unexpected. The next most promising athlete is Tang Ruiyuan of Putian, who achieved the same score. Xu Meiying of Putian, who won four championships in the 50-meter, 100-meter, 200-meter, and discus throw, is also a strong contender. Xu's previous provincial record of 7 seconds in the 50-meter is only 0.1 seconds short of the national record of 6.9 seconds. With diligent training, she still has hope. It should be noted that the first section of the track was mistakenly measured as 60 meters instead of 50 meters. The women's 50-meter race was held on the second day, and Xu Meiying finished first with a time of 8.9 seconds. Everyone was surprised, as Xu was known as the "female flying legs" in the province, and her previous record was 7 seconds. It was suspected that the track measurement was wrong. After re-measurement, the correct time was 7.3 seconds. The decline may have been due to the impact of re-running. In ball sports, Xiamen's women's basketball and Minhou's volleyball teams are strong and can participate in the National Games. The two swimming champions, Shi Huizhi (15 years old) and Yang Mali (13 years old), will also participate. The results of the women's martial arts competition are as follows: Haicheng won both the team and individual events, and Xiamen won both the women's team and individual events.

<p>Education News - Ministry of Education Issues Simplified Character Table</p>
<p>On August 21st, the Ministry of Education issued a decree announcing the Simplified Character Table, followed by nine articles on the implementation of the Ministry's promulgated script by educational administrative organs in various provinces and cities. The previous newspaper has already reported on this. The Ministry of Education has printed these announcements and measures into a booklet and issued it to all education bureaus nationwide for strict implementation. In addition to the measures and simplified characters that have already been published, there is also a section on the selection process. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Selection Process</p>
<p>The function and social needs of simplified characters have been seen in the Ministry's announcement and will not be repeated here. The selection process is described below. Although the Ministry has decided to adopt simplified characters to improve the efficiency of education, this script includes simplified strokes (i.e., shorthand), common characters, variant characters, running script, cursive script, etc. Since the Han Dynasty, there have been many of these characters. The most common ones should be selected and announced. In January of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the former National Language Unification Preparatory Committee proposed to collect existing and more suitable simplified characters and compile them into a simplified character spectrum. The general idea was: "Simplifying Chinese characters is not a fundamental reform of Chinese characters. If existing forms in cursive script, running script, variant forms, and simplified stroke characters are collected and selected, it will be easier to promote. If new forms are created independently, it will be easy to cause resistance because there is no historical habit, and the goal will be difficult to achieve. In fact, there are already many existing simplified characters. With the addition of radicals, the number of characters available for general use should not be lacking, and there is no need to create new forms independently." This statement is practical and feasible. However, the simplified character spectrum cannot be selected in a hurry. It was decided to first compile the simplified character table in batches and then compile the table into a spectrum based on the simplified character table in batches. This is easier to accomplish. Three measures for promoting simplified characters were drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and then to the Central Governing Conference for record. The three original measures are attached below: 1. The Ministry will hire experts to select and announce the simplified character table, following the principle of "narrating but not creating." Only existing characters will be selected. Characters that do not exist will not be created. 2. The simplified character table announced by the Ministry should be subject to phased revisions in order to adopt opinions from all parties and gradually expand the number of simplified characters. 3. The scope of mandatory application of simplified characters is temporarily limited to textbooks for popular schools, popular reading materials, and elementary school textbooks. The details will be determined by the Ministry. The above measures were approved by the Central Political Conference for record. The Ministry entrusted the former National Language Unification Preparatory Committee to carry out this preliminary character selection work. In mid-June of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the first draft was submitted to the Ministry. The Ministry then convened Li Jinxi, Han Yi, Zhao Yuanren, Pan Zunxing, Zhang Jiong, Zhong Lingxiu, Wu Yanin, Gu Liangjie, and others to hold a meeting at the Ministry to review each character in the original draft. The meeting began on June 20th and ended on the 22nd. The original draft was selected and compiled based on the principle of "narrating but not creating." It was originally divided into seventeen rhyme categories, with a total of more than 2,400 characters. This was the first draft. After the meeting, there were many additions and deletions. A total of more than 2,340 characters were selected. Among them, more than 1,200 characters were considered the most appropriate and easy to cast in steel molds. This was the second draft. The Minister and Vice Minister of the Ministry and other relevant departments thoroughly reviewed the second draft. The acceptable characters were circled out and sent to the Social Education Department for detailed study. After detailed review by the Department and consultation with Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxi, and Wang Yi of the former National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, the department convened relevant department heads and personnel from the National Translation and Compilation Bureau to conduct sorting and submit it for approval. This is the first batch of simplified character tables announced this year. According to the above, the first batch of simplified character tables has undergone multiple solemn reviews before being announced. However, the Ministry still believes that there are many characters that should be announced but have not been announced. It is still planned to solicit opinions from all parties and continue to select and review them. Once the promotion of simplified characters has reached a considerable level and the general perception of society has gradually eliminated the old prejudice against "traditional characters," the situation will be re-evaluated and announced in succession in order to complete this arduous task. In addition to casting the listed characters into copper molds for general adoption, the selection process is described as follows.</p>

<p>Category and direction, even how many. However, listening carefully, the song of the spinning maid is high-pitched and long; like its name, it has some girlishness, melancholy, elegance, and orderliness; the song of the gold bell is indistinguishable. Many autumn insects are chirping in a chaotic manner, and the sound is very small. I share a bedroom with my younger brother. At night, when I study under the lamp, I often find those flying autumn insects beside the kerosene lamp. They pounce on the lampshade and throw themselves into the lamp wick and die. But the insects that fly in are not very good-looking, big mole crickets, small wood bells, calling "Goo Goo Goo". We like spinning maids, they are beautiful, lively, and like their name, although the shape of the calling brother is the same as her, but he is worthy of being a brother, with a kind of husband's spirit. Every night we tiptoe to the flower wall, and use our experienced hearing to identify the location of the spinning maid. It has six legs: two pairs in the front, short and small, and one pair in the back, three or four times longer. When it is flapping its wings on the begonia leaves, we just need to gently pinch its wings with our index finger and thumb, and although its hind legs can kick people, it has no place to use them. In one night, we can catch a lot of them, put them in a specially made large bamboo cage, and hang them on the curtain hook to listen to its calls as a fun. The next morning, we release them all, so that they can restore their freedom. That girl is often locked in a cage, I am afraid that she will not live as long as the calling brother, and will die within a few days. Speaking of catching crickets, it is even more fun. We do not know the good or bad of the crickets, we catch all the crickets and keep them in pots. We put a pair of males and females in one pot (at first, we thought that the male had three tails). Every day, we use an elimination system to fight the crickets we catch. No matter how many lose, they are locked in one pot, letting them kill each other. The winner is loved very much, placed in the most exquisite large pot, filled with clear water and rice grains, and sealed as a victorious general, but the fate of the victorious general is also very short, because the next day, another victorious general will be selected from the group of crickets caught, and then a duel will be held before he can take this seat. Sometimes a victorious general actually wins every battle, then he will boast to the children next door, but often loses in their hands, making people unhappy all day long, now thinking about it, it is inevitable to be childish. In Shanghai, fighting crickets is not only gambling money, but also selling them as goods. Walking along Tibet Road, they are everywhere on the ground, but I never stop to watch, now I feel that I have no time to take care of this.

Lu Lu Cheng Bugao, who has already left Jida, resolves the love triangle. Another scene from "Night Fragrance". These days are bad, there are too many depressed people, especially young people. In the newspaper, we can see yellow news of poisoning, drowning, and various suicides every day. According to the suicide statistics in recent years, most of them are love disputes. In Cheng Bugao's "Night Fragrance", there is also a tragic scene of a love triangle. The protagonists are Hu Die, who recently returned from a European tour, Zhao Dan, who is good at playing sentimental roles, and Shu Xiuwen, who crossed from the stage to the screen. Hu Die plays a flower girl, and Zhao Dan, who works as a worker in a dairy farm, is very close to her. Apart from work hours, their figures can often be seen by the stream under the trees. In fact, at this time, Zhao Dan had already been spotted by the country girl Shu Xiuwen, but Zhao Dan did not take her to heart. However, a love triangle has formed. Later, Hu Die met Sun Min, and often accompanied Sun Min to play. This was just a kind of innocent behavior of Hu Die, but who knew that Shu Xiuwen knew about it, and she told Hu Die's father and Zhao Dan. As a result, Hu Die was driven out by her father, and Zhao Dan was also trapped in the whirlpool of frustration in love. Shu Xiuwen then tried her best to comfort Zhao Dan, and eventually got married. At this time, Hu Die had no choice but to throw herself into Sun Min's arms, so the love triangle turned into two pairs of happy (?) marriages. This credit cannot but be attributed to the director Cheng Bugao, who resolved this love triangle. Lu Fuyao's Wedding Celebration.

The introducer was the artist Chuan Benhan. The famous photographer Wang Weiqing produced a film on the spot. The enthusiastic scene was unprecedented, and the guests and hosts did not disperse until after 8:00 pm. Silver Miscellany. Diantong photographer Mr. Chen Yaoting has said he is leaving Diantong, the reason being the "Silver Gossip" of "New Shanghai". Because of Mr. Chen's forced resignation, we feel even more that the lives of small employees are not guaranteed, because Mr. Chen's resignation was caused by "paranoid suspicion". In fact, if you don't want people to know, unless you don't do it, pulling the arrow behind the door will eventually dawn; if you want "harmony to be true", it's better to do less "conspiracy" in the future! Wang Ying left for Beiping the other day, and will probably be back in the next few days. The purpose of the trip. It is said to be purely to appreciate "the autumn of the northern country". Judging from the current situation, everyone around Diantong can be laid off, only Yuan Muzhi and Zhao Bang can not be laid off. The reason? Magicians all know how to do tricks, but each has different skills. Publishing World. The first issue of "Film Art" pictorial, co-edited by Tang Yu and Ding Cong, will be published on September 21.

<h3>Southern Travel Impressions – Our Special Correspondent, Qian Hua</h3>
<p>(39) A Night in Liuzhou</p>
<p>Memorial to Fallen Soldiers in Liuzhou Park</p>
<p>The Independent Fish Peak of Liuzhou</p>
<p>After returning to Nanning from Longzhou, this reporter set off for Liuzhou on the morning of the 19th. The highway from Nanning to Liuzhou is 675 li (approximately 337.5 kilometers), a drive of about nine hours, including two ferry crossings for the car. The first was across the Hongshui (Red Water) River, which originates in Guizhou Province. The river carries red earth downstream, giving it a blood-like color, hence the name Hongshui. The section of highway between Yongning and Liuzhou is relatively flat with much traffic. Along the way, every few li or more than ten li, there are villages and towns, all with markets. Merchants, travelers, and local farmers carry loads back and forth, an endless stream. There is also relatively little wasteland. The scenery during the journey is reminiscent of the countryside of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, truly incomparable to the desolate conditions of the Yong-Long line. Generally speaking, in Guangxi Province, the north-south line is wide and sparsely populated with most plains left barren, while the east-west line is more densely populated with rich produce, forming the commercial and agricultural center of the province. When we arrived in Liuzhou, it was almost dusk. We stayed at the Lequn Society, a guesthouse of the provincial government. Newly built, it is very clean. Liuzhou's famous scenic spot, the Independent Fish Peak, is right to its left. In front of the peak is a huge cave named the Independent Fish Cave, which has now been developed into a park with newly built pavilions. Climbing the peak, one can see the entire city of Liuzhou.</p>
<p>Liuzhou is located in the center of Guangxi, in the middle reaches of the Liujiang River. To the southeast, it uses the Xiang and Xun Rivers to reach the West River; to the northwest, it traces the Honghe River to connect to Guizhou Province; to the south, it connects to Yonglong; and to the north, it exits to Guiquan. It truly has the geographical advantage of being the linchpin of the entire province. In the past, some people proposed making Liuzhou the provincial capital, but due to the importance of border defense and as an incentive for immigrants to the south, Nanning remained the capital. Institutions include the Air Force Department of the Fourth Army Group Headquarters, Guangxi Aviation School, provincial and county middle schools, the Liuzhou District Court, the County Government, and the Shatang Guangxi Rural Construction Experimental Zone, located forty or fifty li from Liuzhou. The Experimental Zone is the largest state-run farm in the province, covering an area of 2,100 mu (approximately 140 hectares). It includes various types of farms, newly built farmers' residences, water-retaining sluices, schools, offices, public stores, warehouses, treasuries, and more. State-run industrial organizations include mechanical factories, alcohol factories, and power plants. After the fire in Liuzhou City in 1928, there were plans to build a new urban and industrial area across the river from the old city area. However, due to the political changes of 1929, it could not be realized. In recent years, the authorities have been actively developing the surrounding wasteland within fifty li of Liuzhou, which has now been almost completely reclaimed. Businessmen are becoming increasingly prosperous. The Guangxi authorities plan to make Liuzhou the province's industrial center. Considering its geography and environment, the future development of its industry and commerce is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Because of the suddenness of the trip, it was expected that we would only stay in Liuzhou for one night. A gentleman from the reception office came to talk and kindly helped plan our sightseeing itinerary in Liuzhou. However, due to time constraints, we only arranged to visit the Shatang Rural Construction Experimental Zone the next morning, as we needed to reach Guilin that evening. After dinner at the Lequn Society, the gentleman accompanied us across the river for a night tour of the city area. The roads are wide, the buildings are magnificent, the electric lights are bright, and pedestrians throng the streets. The lively street scene is no less than that of Yongning or Wuzhou, which truly exceeded the expectations of someone visiting Guangxi Province for the first time. We walked in a winding path to Liuhou Park, which occupies a very large area and contains the Liuhou Temple, other relics of Liu Zongyuan, the Si Liu Pavilion, and a monument to the fallen soldiers of the Seventh Army. The authorities have preserved the ancient inscriptions and renovated the area. Other famous sites include the Liucheng Temple, which houses the stele inscription of Changli Han Yu, which is said to now be broken into three pieces, and the tomb of Liu Zongyuan. According to the county records, Zongyuan was originally buried in the old prefecture capital. Although his coffin was returned, the earthen mound still remains. At the end of the Song Dynasty, the people of Liuzhou moved to Longjiang and rebuilt the mound behind the temple to commemorate him. To the west of the city is the Ganzi Hall, where Liu Zongyuan used to plant yellow oranges and inscribe poems on stone tablets. In the nineteenth year of Qianlong's reign, the prefect Meng Duan built a pavilion on Luochi Pond and renamed it Xiangxiang. In the twenty-eighth year, the Youjiang Dao Wang Jin renovated it. South of the city, near the river, is Tianma Mountain, which rises above the other mountains and below which is the Yang Wenguang Cave, commonly known as Ma'an Mountain. North of the city is the Jiangtai Platform, traditionally believed to have been built by Di Qing of the Song Dynasty during his campaign against Nong Zhigao. It is deeply regrettable that we were unable to visit these places due to the late hour. Liuzhou is now a center for aviation and military affairs. A large airfield is located several dozen li from the Lequn Society, housing the Air Force Department of the Fourth Army Group Headquarters and the Guangxi Aviation School. The next morning, the sound of aircraft engines filled the sky as three to five planes practiced in formation. When this reporter arrived in Liuzhou, academic members Li Shirong, Hu Gangfu, Yao Wannian, and others were involved in a car accident en route from Liuzhou to Guilin. Li Shirong's right arm was broken, and Hu suffered minor injuries. They immediately turned back, and the local military hospital bandaged Li's arm. The next morning, he was flown to Nanning for treatment by military aircraft. It is now reported that Li's right arm has been amputated, tragically leaving him disabled. It truly was an unexpected disaster.</p>
<h3>Serious Flooding in Western Shandong – Highways Completely Destroyed – Plan to Use Disaster Victims to Repair Roadbeds</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River breached at Dongzhuang, Juancheng, on July 10th. In just over ten days, it submerged over a dozen counties in western Shandong. To this day, the breach has not been blocked, and the water source is still strong. Tens of thousands of square li in over a dozen counties remain occupied by the water demon, with no signs of receding. Houses have collapsed, and disaster victims have fled. The devastation is unprecedented. The province's highways have gradually been improved over the years. The Cao-Ji-Yun section, which lies within the flooded area and is divided into Ji-He, Ju-You, Ji-Cheng, and Ji-Dong branch lines, was gradually submerged after the flood, and bus service was suspended long ago. Travel to and from the counties is now by boat. The roadbeds of each line have either been used by the public to build dikes or have been destroyed by the flood. Only the Ji-Dong line suffered relatively minor damage and is currently undergoing repairs in preparation for restoring bus service. The remaining lines will have to wait until the water recedes to be repaired. Liu Xizhong, the director of the Provincial Highway Bureau, reported the damage situation to Li Xiang, the director of the Cao-Ji-Yun section, and requested that disaster victims be used to repair the roadbeds after the water recedes, restoring bus service through work-for-relief to benefit transportation. The Highway Bureau has now submitted this to the Construction Department for approval. The Highway Bureau's report is transcribed below: "According to the report submitted by Li Xiang, the director of the Cao-Ji-Yun section, the Yellow River has overflowed and most of the roadbeds in this section have been submerged. We have dispatched station managers and supervisors from each station to investigate and report. The findings are presented below: (1) On the Ji-He line, from Jixian to Balimiao, a distance of eight li, water is on both sides of the road, and the road has been altered and used as a dike by farmers in many places. From Balimiao to Jiaxiang, Juye, and Longgu, a distance of 142 li, the roadbed is completely submerged in water, with depths ranging from one or two chi to eight or nine chi or even a zhang. The area between Jiaxiang and Juye is the deepest. From Longgu to Shatu Market, there is water on both sides of the road, with breaches of seven or eight chi to one zhang three zhang to four zhang five zhang. From Shatu Market to Heze, although there is no water on the sides of the road, the breached parts of the road are the same as those from Longgu to Shatu Market. (2) On the Ju-Juan line, from Juye to Juancheng, a distance of 150 li, the roadbed is completely submerged in water, with depths ranging from two or three chi to eight or nine chi. The extent of damage to the roadbed is still unknown. (3) On the Ji-Cheng line, from Balimiao to Tangkou, a distance of 42 li, the roadbed is submerged, with depths ranging from two or three chi to five or six chi. From Tangkou to Jinxiang, a distance of 50 li, there are four or five breaches in the Hujichou area, each over two or three zhang long. From Jinxiang to Chengwu, a distance of 125 li, the Shahe River is about two chi deep and fourteen or fifteen zhang long. There are over ten horizontal ditches west of Gaozhuang, each five or six chi to over one zhang long. The roadbed at Zhaolin River is breached by over one zhang, with a water depth of two or three chi. There are many horizontal ditches south of Chengwu. (4) On the Ji-Dong line, from Jining to Wenshang, a distance of 90 li, there is water south of Shilipu for over ten zhang, with a depth of about one chi. There are many small ditches, but no major obstacles. From Wenshang to Dongping, a distance of 60 li, there are three or four breaches, each five or six chi wide, and dozens of horizontal ditches. Of all the lines mentioned above, only the Ji-Dong line suffered relatively minor damage. We have ordered engineers and supervisors to oversee the work and expedite repairs. As for the other breached lines, given the severity of the disaster in each county, we propose to request the Construction Department to adopt a work-for-relief approach after the water recedes, so as to restore the original conditions as soon as possible, which will benefit transportation."</p>
<h3>Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee – Sheltering Unemployed Returned Overseas Chinese – Issuing Free Boat Tickets and Guiding Them Back to Their Native Places – Sending Those Without Homes to Relief Centers</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, due to the worldwide economic depression, it has become difficult for overseas Chinese to make a living abroad. Those who work as laborers are returning home en masse, and even small business owners are being excluded by local people and cannot survive. Therefore, in recent years, countless overseas Chinese from the Americas, Mexico, and various parts of Southeast Asia have returned to China in search of food. Among them, those who return penniless, lack funds, and become displaced are in particularly dire situations. Since the establishment of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, its first priority has been to resettle unemployed returned overseas Chinese, so that they can have a place to belong when they return to their native places. The following measures have been formulated for sheltering and sending unemployed returned overseas Chinese: (A) Any unemployed overseas Chinese holding one of the following credentials, after review and verification by the Relief Affairs Office and the Secretariat, will be eligible for shelter: (1) Those holding repatriation certificates issued by the local government and the Chinese consulate; (2) Those holding exit permits, vouchers, or small portions; (3) Those holding free boat tickets issued by the local government or overseas Chinese organizations; (4) Those holding certifications from local party and government agencies or formal overseas Chinese organizations. All of the above credentials must have been issued within the last five months to be valid; otherwise, they will not be accepted. Upon acceptance of any person holding the above credentials, the credentials must be submitted and photocopied for filing. (B) The following unemployed overseas Chinese will not be accepted by this office under any circumstances: 1. Those with suspected communist affiliations who are wanted by overseas governments; 2. Those who have engaged in misconduct overseas and have been deported by local governments (except for those forced to leave due to promoting the Three Principles of the People); 3. Those who are wanted by the national government; 4. Those who have committed illegal acts and have been accused; 5. Those who have committed illegal acts and have been subject to legal judgment (except for those who have secretly entered the country and are being repatriated); 6. Those who are capable of supporting themselves after returning to the country; 7. Those who have been introduced to work by this office and have returned halfway, or those who are unwilling to go to work when selected; 8. Those who have been financially assisted by this office to return to their native places; 9. Those who have been sent to relief centers by this office. (C) All sheltered overseas Chinese should be sent away as soon as they are received, and efforts should be made to resettle them at any time. The stay within the accommodation is limited to one week. The measures for sending them away are as follows: (1) Regardless of age, those who wish to return to their hometowns will be given a free train or bus ticket, a certificate from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, and guidance to return to their native places; (2) Those who are homeless or disabled will be sent to relief centers for resettlement; (3) Those who are ill will be sent to convenience hospitals for treatment. Once recovered, they will still be sent away separately within the prescribed time limit; (4) Those sheltered overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to their native places but have long journeys, even with free boat or train tickets, but lack food along the way, may be given food allowances as appropriate after assessing their circumstances; (5) Food allowances are divided into four categories: four yuan, three yuan, two yuan, and one yuan, which are given according to the distance of their journey.

<h3>Fujian Province to Reform Local Administrative System – Abolishing Various Corrupt Administrative Districts – Implementing New County Organization</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The local administrative system in Fujian Province will undergo major changes starting October 1st, including the abolition of administrative inspection districts and the implementation of a new county organization, as well as the establishment of district offices. The details are as follows: (1) Fujian Province's administrative inspection districts are currently divided into ten districts, but the number of counties under their jurisdiction is not evenly distributed, with some having ten counties and others only one. Therefore, the provincial government has decided to abolish them and reorganize into seven districts, starting on October 1st. In this way, districts such as the first, second, and fourth will have ten counties, while the sixth district will have seven counties, and the remaining third, fifth, and seventh districts will have eight or nine counties. The administrative units will be more balanced, which will reduce administrative expenses by more than 100,000 yuan per year, which can be used to increase funding for public works. The provincial government will also be able to save two-thirds of its administrative efforts and increase its capacity for administrative reform by one-third. (2) Implementing New County Organization: The organization of county governments in Fujian Province currently lacks a standardized format. Personnel and funding are managed independently by each county, which hinders administrative efficiency. The provincial government has now formulated Provisional Regulations for the Organization of County Governments, instructing all counties to reorganize in accordance with the regulations starting on October 1st. All county governments will uniformly establish three sections: the first section manages civil affairs, the second section manages financial affairs, and the third section manages education and construction affairs. A secretariat and a guard team will also be established. The budget is 1,200 yuan per month for first-class counties, 1,900 yuan per month for second-class counties (Grade A), 1,600 yuan for second-class counties (Grade B), and 1,300 yuan per month for third-class counties. (3) Establishing District Offices: Each county in Fujian Province has district public offices, with some having more than ten districts and others having seven or eight. The district chiefs are appointed by the county government, and funding is raised locally. In general, the corrupt and unscrupulous would seek appointment, extort the people, and cause untold suffering. The provincial government, recognizing this, has decided to implement a fundamental reform by establishing a training class for district administrative personnel, recruiting over 100 students, and providing six months of training. After graduation, they will be sent to Jinjiang, Fuqing, and Lianjiang counties for two months of practical training in each district. This has now been completed. The counties have now been instructed to redraw the districts, with some having six districts and others having three. Each district will have a public office, and the district chiefs and district members will be selected by the county magistrate from the list of graduates and submitted to the provincial government for appointment. The district offices will be funded monthly by the county government. These district offices are to be organized and established by October 1st. The district chiefs of each county have now been appointed and are preparing to establish the district offices. According to observations by the authorities, after this reform of the local administrative system at all levels, politics will inevitably be put on the right track. (September 18)</p>

<p>Tax Police Harassing the Populace - A Petition</p>
<p>Since the tax police fought with salt smugglers at Wai'erzao, the tax police have been arresting innocent people and confiscating firearms from the watch posts, leading to unrest in Zhoulong Market. The local population states that the tax police have been searching homes day and night and wantonly beating people. The situation is worsening, with people afraid to go out to work during the day and hiding in the fields at night. This constant harassment is unbearable for the rural area. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 18th at 1 p.m., several hundred people spontaneously gathered to petition the city. The County Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order. After arriving in the city, they sought to meet with the County Magistrate, but due to the crowds, they sent five representatives. County Magistrate Yuan personally received them and then met with Chen Xizuo, the standing member of the County Party Headquarters. They then went to the County Government to discuss the matter with County Magistrate Yuan, and decided to send Lin Bin, the head of the First Section, to Wai'erzao to appease the people and immediately order the Xinchang Tax Police to release those who were wrongly arrested. After announcing this decision to the representatives, they were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall to Be Completed Soon</p>
<p>The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Nanhui County, located in front of the Chenghuang Temple in the city, began construction in May of this year. All the bricks, tiles, and round tiles were donated by the Da-Zhong brick and tile factory in the county. The construction funds were provided by the County Government, the County Party Headquarters, the Education Bureau, and local gentry. The hall is in the palace style, and the interior painting work is currently underway, managed by the county's Construction Section. It is scheduled to be completed before the Double Ten Festival.</p>
<p>Taicang – Kidnapping Case - Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Gu Zhongda, a villager from Liuhang Township in the third district of the county, was targeted by bandits due to his modest wealth. On the night of the 26th of last month, four burly men broke down his door, confined his family in one room, and forbade them from making any noise. They first looted over sixty yuan in cash. Before leaving, they kidnapped Gu Zhongda to a waiting bandit ship, which quickly sped away. Later, the bandits sent a letter demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan, arranging to meet in Lvsi, Nantong, to negotiate. After receiving the letter, Gu Hongxiang replied requesting a reduction in the ransom. The bandits then sent another letter, agreeing to reduce it to 11,000 yuan. While preparing to negotiate, the County Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Team arrested three suspects, including Zhao Fuxiang, at the Fuqiao estuary. They were sent to the County Public Security Bureau yesterday afternoon, where Director Dong interrogated them before sending them to the County Judiciary for processing.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Various Sectors Vigorously Fight Against High Long-Distance Call Rates</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications issued an order to change the method of charging for long-distance telephone calls, limiting each call to two minutes, the Wuxian Banking Association was the first to express its opposition. The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce also believes that this new regulation is very detrimental to merchants and has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications and the Executive Yuan, appealing for the revocation of the order or the establishment of a proper system to ensure that merchants are not harmed. The news media in Wuxian County received a circular from the Shanghai Newspaper Association the day before yesterday, unanimously expressing their support and deciding to temporarily suspend the payment of telephone fees from this month until a proper system is established. Other trade associations are also working to fight against it.</p>
<p>Male and Female Police Officers Commit Suicide One After Another</p>
<p>Yan Chao, a female household registration officer at the Public Security Bureau, only seventeen years old, committed suicide on the 18th by swallowing toilet water in the County Hospital ward due to marital problems. Fortunately, she was discovered early and immediately rescued, allowing her to recover. In addition, Guo Muyu, a police officer at the second precinct of the first branch of the Public Security Bureau, also shot himself in the chest with a rifle on the 18th due to the escape of his mistress and his dismissal by the head of the branch, which caused him great distress. The bullet hit a vital area and he died immediately. The local prosecutor's office sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that it was a suicide. The precinct prepared for the collection of the body.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Opposing the Establishment of a National Exhibition Venue in Wuxi</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Promotion Association recently planned to hold a National Products Movement Exhibition in Wuxi to promote national products. Qian Chengchu, a member of the association, came to Wuxi on the 14th of this month to negotiate with representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and local department stores, silk shops, and other businesses. However, due to the depressed market in Tianjin, there were proposals to cancel the exhibition in Wuxi. Now, the association has decided to officially open the exhibition in Wuxi on the 15th, with the exhibition lasting twenty days. The venue will be at the former site of the Gongbu Factory in Xin County, Huangnitu Bridge. Upon hearing this news, local department stores, silk shops, copper and tin shops, and other businesses expressed their opposition and submitted petitions to the County Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting a ban to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>County Anti-Smoking Association to Be Reorganized</p>
<p>The County Anti-Smoking Committee of this county has been ordered to be reorganized. All anti-smoking investigation and enforcement matters will be handled by the Third Section established by the County Government. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Wang immediately expedited the closure of the County Committee. Yesterday (the 19th), it was handed over to the Second Section of the County Government for reception. Yang Zhiquan was appointed as the head of the section, Zhou Zhenquan and Mao Yu as section members, and Gao Zongpan, Sun Liangfu, and Shao Jingru as clerks. All anti-smoking investigators will be temporarily suspended pending the finalization of the budget, in order to save money. Meanwhile, the reorganization will be reported to the provincial capital for filing.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>County Government Reorganizes County Anti-Smoking Association</p>
<p>County Magistrate Hou of Wujin County received an order from the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to reorganize the County Anti-Smoking Committee. In accordance with the regulations, committee members were appointed to organize the Anti-Smoking Section. On the 18th, Liu Chao was appointed as the head of the Fourth Section (i.e., the Anti-Smoking Section), Yao Chuanduo and Huang Bingzhong as section members, and Liu Qinshen and others as clerks.

<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Shatian Bureau - Reorganizing the Entire Province into Three Bureaus</p>
<p>The funding for each Shatian official property bureau in this province has never been regulated. The bureaus have relied entirely on the 30% commission from sales to maintain their operations, which has prevented them from operating effectively. In order to thoroughly rectify the situation, the Department of Finance, in addition to transferring the official property portion to the county governments for management, has also drafted a reorganization plan and organizational regulations for the Shatian Bureau, which have been approved by the provincial government. The original twelve bureaus will be abolished by the 10th of this month. They will be replaced by three bureaus. The First Bureau will be established in Zhenjiang, administering Jiangdu, Yizheng, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Jurong, Yangzhou, and Danyang, for a total of nine counties. The Second Bureau will be established in Changshu, administering Wujin, Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Taixing, Rugao, Nantong, and other seven counties. The Third Bureau will be established in Shanghai, administering Guan County, Nanhui, Chuansha, Fengxian, Jinshan, Songjiang, Qidong, Chongming, Haimen, and other ten counties. To facilitate operations, each bureau will establish an office. The office of the First Bureau will be in Nanjing, the office of the Second Bureau in Nantong, and the office of the Third Bureau in Qidong. The directors of the three bureaus have been appointed by the Department of Finance: Ouyang Guang for the First Bureau, Huang De for the Second Bureau, and Guo Fupei for the Third Bureau. The appointment of office staff will be selected by the directors of each bureau and submitted to the department for approval. The bureaus will be established on the 21st, starting with investigative work. Clearing up the Shatian issues will begin next year. The directors of each bureau are graduates of the Central Political School assigned to serve in this province.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Jointly Operated Tourist Train</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau and the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, in order to facilitate tourism, have jointly organized a tourist train to Yongkang Fangyan and Zhuji Wuxie. The train is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 22nd of this month. Those going to Fangyan will take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to Jiangbian to Yiwu, and then transfer to a bus to Fangyan. Those going to Wuxie will go from Zhuji Station to Wuxie Temple. Rickshaws and meals will be provided by the railway. The trip will be a round trip in the same day with no overnight stays.</p>
<p>Jiashan</p>
<p>Reorganizing Assets in Each District</p>
<p>The County Finance Committee has already been established and has dispatched personnel to receive assets in each district. Standing committee members Hu Weixin and Shen Jiren convened a special meeting to reorganize the assets in each district and decided on the reorganization plan and implementation measures. The reorganization period is set for two years. The steps include investigation, budgeting, collection, statistics, storage, payment methods, additional fundraising, supervision, and auditing. At the same time, it was decided to hire one clerk and one collector for each district.</p>
