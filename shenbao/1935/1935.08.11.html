<h3 id="c15">兒童年與兒童讀物 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 秉</p>
<p>兒童讀物。羣號爲「兒童精神之糧食。」此名取義至。當用字甚確。蓋所謂食品者。有珍錯之供。嗜好之味。是皆非恒人所易致。進之且未必有裨於營養。今云糧食。悉擯此類而專舉禾黍。禾黍爲養生所必需。無間貧富。日必資之。以喩兒童讀物。彌復相似。繼父母不盡購讀物以饗兒童。而窮鄉僻壤。苟有一塵之學校。卽見兒童讀物之蹤跡。兒童作息歌呼而。外展卷諷翫。智慧於焉開展。性習於焉型成。兒童讀物誠兒童之「糧食。」非糖果鮮橘水比也。</p>
<p>兒　年始於本月。出版家襄此盛舉。皆刋布廣吿。以廉値發　兒童讀物俾兒童獲沾便益。增進其精神之健康。斯意美善。良可讚歎。觀各家兒童讀物之目錄。又復叢書如林。卷數累百。兒童瞻眺其問。儘堪擇所愛好。放懷大嚼。祈願兒童前途佳勝者。亦可以欣然自慰矣。</p>
<p>顧諦察各家兒童讀物之實質。自慰者卽將轉而自失。蓋其時所發見者。是諸糧食未必有裨於營養也。彼禾黍之滋長本於大自然之潛徘。猶以人力之異施。而有品質之差。此所謂精神之糧食。者其長育無與於他力。品質高下一斷於耕耘之勤否。耕耘草草。斯成果庸庸矣。我嘗綜觀各家兒童讀物。舉其缺失約有數端皇帝公主。搖筆卽來。神仙鬼。怪運箱皆是。詭謀售欺。妄云智慧。行一小善。便致富貴以巽弱爲美德。視力作爲苦役。凡此之類。皆不適於當今之世。尤非所宜於我族此日之兒童。不幸兒童讀物中往往遇之。此意識不純之弊也。布局簡拙。觀篇首而揣知結尾。立言空泛。雖終卷而弗留印象。兒童愛活動。喜變化。厭接浮談。願親實蹟。兒童讀物不足以滿其志。遂顧而之他。街頭巷口累累陳列之連環圖書。敎育專家羣以鴆毒視之者。轉爲兒童之恩物。此技術不修之弊也。造語遺辭。或違於名理。集言成文或乖於語法。或雜鄉士俚言。非他方人所克解。或竟信　構句。非我國人所宿習。漫云倣效兒童口吻。實則兒童决無如此語言。兒童久而習之。語言思維遂趨歧途。不特語文敎學橫生阻障。各科敎學亦皆蒙其影響。此文字不當之弊。也其爲詩歌。亦多可指。往往詩趣毫無。印象莫覩。歌體操則曰「起得早。學體操。身體好。志氣高。」歌景物則曰「紅花開。蝴蝶來。好風景。眞可愛。」或則堆砌警誡之文。若嚴父之訓子。或則雜凑脣邊之語。若灘簧之登臺。徒求趁韻。不恤拗句。意在可解不可解之間。味在若有又若無之中其所與之觀感。將使兒童恍然有悟。以爲詩歌者。乃如是枯燥無聊之物。雖終其身而弗興爲緣。又復奚所憾惜。然則兒童詩歌非第。不足以陶冶性情。甚且爲　聰塞明之具矣。其爲圖畫。復少合作。往往僅具輪廓。　言妙肯。他且不論。專言人物。鉤勒不應乎解剖。神態胥陷於板滯。兒童悉呈獃相。工農皆成流氓。兒童愛觀圖畫。一編到手。惟此爲先。佳作莫逢。劣品亦復過癮。然於其體物寫生之能。正乃　抑不題。畫敎學至少成績。自有衆因。然未始不由於兒童讀物之揷圖荒陋也。以上舉其大者。若求詳備。恐十萬言猶未能罄。我非好爲苛論事實如是。掩飾何益。世不乏賢明之父母。良善之敎師。通達之敎育家苟一問兒童讀物之津。必且謂我見之未周。言之未盡矣。</p>
<p>於此卽有二問題。是堆積盈倉之精神糧食。實乃徒存形貌。品質逈殊。寬泛言。之固可以豐足自豪。嚴謹言。之豈不幾等於零耶。今値兒童年。而兒童精神之糧食幾等於零。堪以自失者。就復過。之更進一步而爲思維。是徒存形貌之精神糧食。因日日陳設於兒童之左右。俾隨時取而吞之。其爲害兒童之營養者幾何。其阻遏兒童之生機者幾。何雖有巧算。殆莫能驟答。今値兒童年。而兒童正濫吞品質迪殊之精神糧食。以阻遏其生機。豈非尤堪自失者乎。</p>
<p>一物之發生及存在。不離時空之關係。我族此日。而有徒存形貌品質逈殊之兒童讀物。自有種種之。因然著作家與出版家視之太輕。爲之太易。要不能辭其咎。兒童讀物固商品也。顧尋常商品。猶必期購者之適用。况兒童讀物爲兒童精神之糧食。能草草爲之「出門不認貨」。耶爲小學敎師未必易於設敎大學。卽可知編撰兒童讀物未必易於傳世之述作名山之事業。不幸此基本觀念爲著作家與出版家所忽視。若輩惟求產量之多。成貨之速。遂令花花綠綠。燦爛陳於書櫃者。實乃同於無物。甚且視無物尤有弊患。良可嘆也。</p>
<p>徒嘆損人興致。亦復無濟於。事所冀著作家與出版家及今覺悟。先立基本觀念。兒童讀物必需鄭重出。之凡上述諸弊。必避之若凂。勿以昔之積几盈架者自誇富足。宜平心靜。氣逐一審察。速汰其尤劣。者而習存其較可者。一方從頭做起。別製佳品。此自非倉卒間事。他日佳品漸多。則並今之較可者而亦汰之。庶幾兒童有品質純良之精神糧食。其性習智慧。可得適度之營養。明達之著作家與出版家其有意於此乎。自兒童年發軔。澈底改善兒童讀物。亦大有造於兒童之舉也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）負責方面相信英國政府派財政代表羅斯爵士赴中國調查、其主要使命、可分爲兩項、一則謀穩定中國之貨幣、二則使南京政府獲得國際借欵、由各外國政府予以担保、俾增强中國政府之地位、就第一項使命而論、負責方面相信中國貨幣可與英鎊發生聯繫、但如確定中國貨幣對英鎊之比價、則不特保障此稱比價、需欵過鉅、且足以危及金鎊集團、殊屬不易辦到、此外似可模倣阿根廷貨幣「貝沙」之辦法、以英鎊作爲表現中國貨幣漲落之尺度、卽作爲中國貨幣「標價基準」、如是則當屬可行、又此間金融界人士柑信、唯有中國經濟複興、中國鐵道借欵、方可恢復還償本息、如貸欵中國、用以付還積欠中國鐵道借欵持劵人之欵項、則殊爲失策、英國所以主張由國際借欵中國、以供建設費用、其故實在於此、惟此兩種計　、不免遭迅各項難關、一則爲日本政府之反對態度、此層羅斯爵士當力謀加以克復、彼將游說日本政府、俾瞭解英國此項計劃、絕無政治背景、其目的僅在改良中國之商業及財政地位、而日本對華貿易、則首蒙其利也、二則爲貨幣問題之困難、此層羅斯爵士將依上述方法、加以解决、三則國際借欵倘由外國政府担保、則各國國會、未必能加以核准、蓋目前多數國家、均苦預算負担過重、不　再增此電荷　、因此關係各國政府、分別派代表前往中國、其目的在調查中國現狀、及其經濟改良情形、起草報告書、提以交各本國政府、俾政府根據報吿書所述之理由、向國會提出法案、要求担保中國借欵、如是則當易得國會之核准也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>空前未有之天門水災</p>
<p>小舟淸晨由黃家橋划出、宛轉穿行於隴樹溝渠間、每過人家、舟子恒高問有人入城否、應聲而上者、先後共達十二人、聞因附近皆陸居、故舟划缺乏、每行應相呼約也、約行二里、卽到吳家長灣、棄舟踏泥而上、村大未淹斃流徙者、正從事補屋除泥諸工作、惟舉動遲滯、有氣無力、殊有不修葺固不可、修葺亦極無意味之神情、據談、村有人家六十餘戶、水至皆避登屋頂、議餓三日夜、始逐退水而得下、雞犬豬牛、均已淹斃、浮腫惡臭、情狀極慘、時城中哭聲震野、且時聞碰碰槍聲、當以爲保安隊射殺蛟怪、後始悉乃威脅微集民划、留以自用云云、</p>
<p>出村復涉積水、深可沒膝、內有枝條絆足、於近邊處見爲大豆、但僅餘糟枝、而無豆葉、有婦人遠立大罵、謂「大水後不應再踐踏其豆地、使欲求一薪恐亦不可得也、」走近婦旁、見尙抱一赤身幼孩、腹脹如鼓、骨瘦似柴、殊爲可憐、渡天門縣河、卽至護城堤街、仰觀屋頂沉澱之泥、知水位已退丈五左右、但襄河堤潰未阻、縣河流量猶甚猛遠、民十及民二十水位均甚高、但皆未上堤街、令年則高出堤街三尺、較民十最高水位、尙高五尺、爲禍之慘烈、可以想見、堤街乃百商會萃之區、亦天門精華之所在、商鋪櫛比、裝璜員公署水未退盡、暫假堤街一西藥店辦公、當訪專員兼縣長石幼平氏、承告天門水災槪况如次、</p>
<p>天門地勢低窪、襄河縣河、橫貫其間、民衆依堤爲命、七月七日、鍾祥縣屬襄堤三四工地段潰决、居高臨下、縣河流域、首當其衝、悉被俺沒、而縣屬第四區雙河塊、不幸亦經吿潰、七十二垸淪爲澤國、水勢異常汹猛、一日夜竟陡漲一丈九尺餘、災情之慘、空前未聞、初鍾祥七日决口、八日天門聞訊、電詢鍾祥京山兩縣縣長、均未得復、原因電桿冲壞、遂致交通斷絕、石氏卽於是日率同工務技士劉昇恒等、赴岳口一帶、督率防護、幸駐軍加入搶救、尙未發生意外、惟天門下午一時許、水頭到達、節節上漲、至九日晨八時、登時漫堤决口、搶險保安隊及民夫、曾冲沒十餘人、護城堤西段漫潰大小十三處、西門被重災者約三百餘家、全城除南北兩城樓及北門外古城堤巔外、餘無一片乾土、至晚全城瀰漫、一片救命之聲、不絕於耳、加以風濤作吼、山岳若爲震搖、人世鬼蜮、幾乎莫能辨詰、</p>
<p>查潰口地勢、較天門縣約高二丈有奇、（以吳淞水準計算）故水到天門、直冲湧瀉、爲害最烈、再天門以下、則爲漢川漢陽、蓋地勢更較天門爲低、故現在水勢雖退、漢川與漢陽、尙在波底、綜計天門全縣、除第三·六·七·三區地面較高、未被淹沒外、其餘各地、皆一片汪洋、災區面積、約六千三百餘里、占全縣八分之七、被災人口約十二萬四千餘戶、六十四萬三千餘口、占全縣人口十分之八、被淹農田、約一百四十餘萬欵、占全縣農田十分之八、房產、農作·衣物·家畜·等損失、不下二千五百萬元、淹斃人口、共約一萬二千餘口、公家損失、如電話經·縣道·區道·以及公共建築如公署·孔廟·各機關、各學校·新建碉樓、新修城墻·等等破壞·估計不下三十萬元、今春爲欲改進農村經濟生產、一請由經委會發給桑苗伴種八萬三千株、栽活曾長一尺餘、一請由省建廳發給精選棉種三千二百石、均已播種開花、今皆付諸東流矣、</p>
<p>善後辦法、（一）以工代振、趕築潰口、以免天漢等縣、仍受洪流威脅、（二）借貸耕種耕牛、俾得於水退之地、乘機耕種、（三）護城堤潰口十餘處、亟應修復、測估計需工振費五萬九千元、（一二兩項不在內）一切用費、端賴各方贊助、現所領到省府振欵及慰勞金共計一萬三千元、麪粉一千三百袋、蠶豆一千二百二十五包、杯水車薪、頗難濟事、丞盼源源救濟、俾得漸復生機、</p>
<p>嗣記者興辭、入城視察、石氏派副官匡濟楚爲嚮導、縣城地勢低下、故環築護城堤、長約卅二里、以防水患、縣河繞流其西南東三面、長約廿四里、故全城房產生靈、皆唯護城堤保險是恃、此次護城堤本身宣吿破產、先後冲潰大小三十餘口、致全城淪爲澤國、造成亘古未有之慘禍、沿堤街西行、至義水關周家巷、洪水漫堤、由巷一瀉而入、冲刷成阱、深陷數丈、屋宇倒塌、人口死傷、無異飛機所投巨彈之轟炸、西堤下街中街、均各有决口、情况同前、惟災創尤較慘烈、</p>
<p>乘舟入城、先過西塔寺、寺建自晋代、歷史頗古、今亦蕩析無存、僅賸老樹三株而已、迨抵城垣、水深尙封東北西三門洞、舟由西城塌口駛入、見中心小學（有十二班、辦理尙完善）土地淸丈辦事處等機關、水位高及門窗、而比較舊朽之民屋、更倒塌不堪、渡入專員公署、大堂前院、一婦以門扇爲筏、正划行其中、辦公室·會客室·及花庭等處地勢較高、水退而淤泥尺餘、掃除亦頗費工、出後門、登北城門樓、管押男女犯卅四人、南城樓亦押有八十人、均於大水時、由監獄移禁之、樓小人多、坐立已嫌擁擠、夜臥恐更無隙地、暑天侷促如此、殊爲可憐、守兵爲十六中隊、隊長趙霹、素能整飭軍紀、故聲譽尙佳、城內南北正街路已現出、北外仍係滔滔洪水、</p>
<p>從北城下乘原舟、繞西門、波擊門洞、欵欵作嚮、城牆上草棚甚多、難民臨城洗衣汲水、如居堤邊、西門一帶冲毀民屋一百餘家、無片瓦殘磚可見、惟當十三四日水退時、樹上冲掛死屍不少、由南門步行入城、南正街舖面已有開者、惟西部尙陰森如地獄、因倒屋壓人甚多、惡臭熏人、草敢近前問津也、</p>
<p>天門大水淹城之慘狀</p>
<p>歸辭石專員、堅承留餐、席次得聞石氏關於襄河水患、曾擬有治理計劃、略謂「襄河含泥量甚大、易淤河身、徒增堤高、防不勝防、且襄河原係沙底、疏濬亦屬匪易、應於陝境環山疊嶂中、建修大規模之蓄水池、幷將水位隨時報吿中下游、再於中游設法、保持河岸不變、下游多闢支流、以洩水勢、如此以言防水、庶可奏效」云云、按在上游建築節制水庫、報吿水位等計劃、誠爲根本要圖、主管水利之機關、想當已籌思之矣、</p>
<p>此外興天門災情有關之事、尙有三伴當述、一、當洪水上岸、冲破下堤街居民卅餘家時、保長楊倫記之父楊大振、見水勢奇險、亟以重價雇船二隻、裝載家人及街鄰鄭永盛·沈義興·章雲靑·陳永興二房等男女三十餘人、幷各携帶衣箱銀錢等物、停於沈義興後門、不料突有保安隊十五中隊士兵五人、（中有麻子傳令兵一人、手執盒子砲、來此勒令讓船一隻、否將開槍射擊、楊大振等遵命併坐一船、船逾重搖搖欲沉、另行呼救他船、所遺衣箱銀錢於前讓之船、未經取出、該士兵等卽迫船快去、而楊大振等所擠乘之船、旋被翻入水中、計淹死廿餘人、此外臨救逼財之事、亦曾發生數起、猶幸專員由岳口趕回尙早、在治安問題上、始化險爲夷、關於奪船淹死人民之慘案、聞死者家屬楊倫記等、當專員巡視堤險時、曾跪地「攔馬喊寃」、專員測然心動、爲之墜戾、</p>
<p>二、天門西鄉薪河、有一巾幗英雄汪李氏、當水頭奄至、人民高登屋頂、正哭聲震地、危急萬分時、汪李氏竟能奮不顧身、冒汹濤駭浪、往返搖櫓、救出災民二百餘人、且不受一錢報酬、日前省府視察團團長李書城氏、聞之深爲敬佩、特代表省府、獎汪李氏大洋四十元、此外尙有一自動救人數百之船夫楊苟、亦受獎二十元、</p>
<p>三、有所謂「茶會」之組織者、假施茶慈善爲名、募化公德、幷以「天崩地裂」、「紅雨大水」種種報應邪說、恐嚇民衆入會、迷信之者、除捐欵送禮外、甚有被神迫令變賣房產、以充會資者、謂如此俟遇大亂時、可騎新掃帚昇天、或穿新鞋飛身、或執刀矛閉目向北方亂殺、自有菩薩來救、是會創自民國十六七年、初無人注意、其徒衆至爛漫天門京山沔陽數縣、巨的原爲借神斂錢、但最近行動、頗有將成黃巾賊·白運敎·義和團·之趨勢、保安司令部拿獲首領數人、餘眾於大水灌城時、尙擬來城刼獄、猶幸防範得力、前途可保無虞</p>
<p>松灑</p>
<p>追查盜踪搜獲贓物</p>
<p>漕涇西獲塘鄉民蔣四根等兩家刦案、茲經該處九分駐所查悉、有鄉民姚阿八孫圓卿頗涉嫌疑、相率離去、旋據探悉、孫圓卿匿居妻父陸子民家、前晚該分所不動聲色、馳赴陸宅搜查、孫圓卿已聞風逃亡、於樓上獲衣箱兩只、內綢衣十餘件、均非農家應用之物、詰據陸子民供認係其婿孫圓卿携來等語、該分所遂將陸子民連同臟物申解縣公安局核辦</p>
<p>公務員狎妓被罰</p>
<p>土地局職員江陰人章幼瀾、年屆耳順、性好漁色、昨晚十一時許、該昌約同工役二人、在西外飲酒後、即在長橋街交通旅館闢四號房間、挾私娼陳秀寶消遣、詛爲二分駐所稽查房間所獲、認爲有妨風化、帶局訊罰洋五元、旋由某有力者保釋云、</p>

<p>此行歷四閱月</p>
<p>所經之地甚多、近東非洲英屬模里斯島、有華僑約八千人、法屬布旺島、有華僑約二千人、法屬馬達加斯加島、有華僑約三千人、近哥侖布英屬馬宜島、有華僑約二百人、葡屬東非洲羅連士麥、及卑拉、有華僑各約四百人、南非聯邦、有華僑約三千餘人、其餘印度洋中諸小鳥、有數百華僑者、有數十華僑者、亦有不滿十人者、如英屬之山詩巴島、及英屬東非之蒙巴殺等、所謂華僑足跡遍世界、信不虛也、上述各地僑胞深以距離祖國遙遠、消息異常隔膜爲憾、惟對於祖國所處之國際地位、及外交政策、都能諒解、而愛國心之熱烈、則與世界各地之華僑、如出一轍、惜文化低落、人才缺乏、</p>
<p>亟應設法補救</p>

<p>孔氏致詞</p>
<p>中央銀行總裁兼處長孔祥熙氏致開會詞謂、諸位、今天爲經濟研究處成立後第一次的全體會議、有幾位從遠趕來出席、使我們有共同討論和研究的機會、不勝榮幸之至、這次會議、本來應當在本處成立以後不久的時候、即行召集、但因有幾位聘任和特約專門委員、散處各地、到上海來開會、頗不容易、且本處尚在草創時期、一切工作的動向、正在計劃及調查上進行、故展延到現在、方能開第一次的全體會議、今天先將本處設立的目標和以後的希望、簡單的說明一下、鄙人最初主張設立本處的動機爲適應事實上的需要、照鄙人個人的經驗和觀察、人類的思想、常爲環境所影響、同時環境常爲思想所轉移、故歐美各國的經濟長足進展、雖爲十九世紀工業革命的結果、但他們一般學者、在數百年前、對於經濟問題的注意、實爲一種絕大的推動力、例如英國在貨幣經濟發達後十六世紀的時候、一般學者、即有重商主義Mercantiliam的主張、研究國外貿易和租稅政策、這便是經濟進爲科學的黎明時期、後來又有一種重農學派Physiacrats反對重商主義的主張、經濟問題、便脫離了道德政治與法律而獨立、對於生産交易分配消費的界說、有絕大的貢獻、這便是經濟學確進爲科學的第二時期、至於最後完成大功的便是斯密亞丹Adam　Smith、他的原富Wealth　of　Nation一書、乃綜集以前各家的學說、並且注意消費者的利益、所以他便成爲廣義經濟學的鼻祖、而完成第三時期的工作、自此以後、研究經濟的人、雖派別紛歧、不過因環境不同而主張各異、因爲歐美經濟學說、常常隨着經濟的發展、而有日新月異的現象、所以鄙人認爲思想常爲環境所影響、同時環境常爲思想所轉移、我們處在這經濟戰爭日趨劇烈的世界、對於經濟方面的一切問題、不得不隨時隨地、加以注意和研究、方能迎合潮流、成爲一個現代的國家、返觀我國、自通商以後、雖巳有數十年之久、而經濟事業的進展、常落於人後、最近數年的入超、最高達八六七·一九一·〇〇〇元、最低亦四九四·四五一·〇〇〇元、工商凋敝、農村破産、使全國的國民經濟、陷於枯窘的途徑、這種危險的現象、根本上乃因國人太不注意經濟問題的緣故、因爲我國雖有數千年的文明、僅有人生哲學觀念、而無純粹經濟觀念、例如大學曰、「德者本也財者末也」、又孟子曰、「亦有仁義而巳矣、何必曰利」、這種散漫而含混的人生哲學、與西文整取而分明的經濟思想相較、其對於人類行動的影響、自然有天淵之別、因爲歐美自斯密亞丹以後、一般經濟學者、莫不以「以最小犧牲得最大效用」的口號、爲談經濟學的共同原則、思想爲事實之母、我國的學者、既然忽視經濟問題、安能希望我國的經濟事業有長足的進展呢、因爲以上的原因、本人自主持本行以後、即主張設立經濟研究處、希望聚集全國的經濟學者、對於國內外的經濟狀況、隨時研究、替國內的經濟界、指示一條出路、來共同奮鬭、因爲中央銀行總握全國金融的樞紐、一切經濟事業、均待中央銀行領導各銀行去扶助、同時中央銀行爲全國的國庫、與政府的財政問題、亦有密切關係、所以本處成立時、將研究事務分設四組、所以本處成立時、將研究事物分設四組、即農業工業商業及金融、希望在這四組內下一番調查和研究的工夫、將所得的結果、作爲本行營業方針、及政府經濟政策的參考、總括一句話說、我國千瘡百痍的經濟病象、乃因以前太不注意衛生的緣故、現在已快達到危險的時期、希望聚集診治這經濟病的專門醫生、來切切實實的研究病原、同時開一個藥方、出來替這病人挽救一下、今天開會時、希望諸位多多的發表意見、俾本處有相當的成就、並希望在散會以後、各位聘任及特約委員、隨進與本處互通聲氣、俾在本處專門服務的同人、得以隨時取得工作的響導、</p>
<p>議決各案</p>
<p>孔氏致開會詞畢、由專門委員兼專務長傳汝霖報告兩年來該處工作情形後、旋即開始討論、議決案件、共十餘件、至下午一時、即告閉會、所議各案如下、（一）彭學沛·壽景偉·陶孟如·等提工作計劃案四件、（二）劉蔭茀提統制匯兌一件、及開採金銀礦案一件、（三）傳汝霖提請制定金貼現規則一件、（四）傳汝霖等提關於票據交換案二件、鄔志陶等提、關於統一銀行會計案二件、（五）祝世康等提、關於採用進口額限制案一件、（六）瞿荊洲提、關於設立農工不動産銀行案一件、當議決分別建議各主管機關、或送交該行經濟研究處辦理、</p>

<h3 id="c141">實施義務教育計畫　（下） <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— （雷震在中央無綫電台播音演講）</p>
<p>五、師資</p>
<p>關於師資訓練問題、約分以下各項、</p>
<p>（一）短期小學師資之養成　各省市在實施義務教育第一期開始以後、應由各省市立或縣立高級中學及師範學校內、廣設短期小學師資訓練班、招收相當初中畢業程度的學生、研究小學教材和教學法、訓練期滿、考試及格、給以證明、准其擔任、短期小學教員、</p>
<p>（二）一年制短期小學師資之養成　各省市在第一期內、招收文理通順、常識豐富、有志為短期小學教員的人員、經考試及格給以證明、准其充任一年制短期小學教員、在必要時可斟酌情形、令各公務人員為短期小學服務、</p>
<p>（三）改良私塾師資的養成　中縣市立初級中學或師範學校及大規模之縣立小學內、設塾師訓練班、招收私塾教師專授短期小學課程之教材及教學方法、經過短期訓練、考查及格予以證明、准其充當改良私塾教師、</p>
<p>（四）檢定小學教員　各省市按地方需要、推廣師範學校、簡易師範、簡易師範科等、培養小學師資、並設法使不合格之小學教員、有進修的機會、依照檢定規程使取得資格、</p>
<p>六、校舍設備</p>
<p>關於校舍設備、因義務教育經費不足、目下只能因陋就簡、但必須籌建正式校舍及設備經費、以為將來成立普通小學之用、茲將校舍設備之原則報告於次、</p>
<p>（一）校舍　各小學區　設之短期小學、得充分利用當地公所祠廟等房屋或租借民房、萬一無可租借、得暫建極簡單之棚舍應用、各學區應在十年內擇定相當地點籌備另建普通小學正式校舍、如無力建築、得由縣市政府協助之、</p>
<p>（二）設備　短期小學設備、參照普通小學設備辦理、各小學區應在十年內籌足設備經費、以備改短期小學為普通小學時一切設備之用、</p>
<p>七、辦理義務教育機關</p>
<p>義務教育之實施、中央由教育部主辦、各省市由省市主管教育行政機關主辦、各縣市由主管教育行政之科局主辦、各級主辦機關、均應組織委員會襄助辦理、</p>
<p>八、懲獎原則</p>
<p>（一）義教辦理之狀況、於地方行政人員考績時應視為特別注意事項、</p>
<p>（二）人民捐助辦理義務教育經費者、得照捐資興學獎勵辦法從優獎勵之、</p>
<p>（三）關於推行義務教育之懲獎辦法由教育部另定之、</p>
<p>關於實施義務教育的辦法、大致已經報告過、義務教育的目標、就是在改造環境、適應環境、增加人民的生活能力、所以教育要顧到社會的需要、像中國地大物博、交通不便、不僅一省有一省的風俗·習慣·語言、就是一縣一地方也各有各的風俗·習慣·語言、地域這樣隔閡、人民各各生活在不同的環境裹、所以總不易於團結、現在要靠用義務教育的力量、使社會風俗習慣齊一起來、大家從不同的生活環境裹有其共同的精神、而又能因時因地按所需發展其生產技能、提高生活興趣、不僅國內沒有文盲、且能使愚　變為聰穎、貧窮進為富有疾病轉為健全、罪惡　向光明、有整個的健全的國民來共同負起救國圖存的責任、何患國家不能強盛、民族不能復興、所以我認為義務教育就是救亡圖存復興民族最根本最有效的工作、還希望全國同胞、大家共同努力、襄助政府才好、（完）</p>

<p>因此，晚餐畢後，當童子們羣集到課室裹再去做些「熱鬧的玩意兒」的時候，裴夫人也姍姍來了，手裹拿一具提琴，和她的丈夫說了一句話後，就直到乃德的身邊，其時他坐在一個角裹，以濃厚興趣在留心看着。</p>
<p>「現在，我的孩子，給我們奏一齣曲。我們音樂隊裹剛需要一個提琴，我想你能彈得好好的。」</p>
<p>她想他或者要躊躇；但是他竟立時接過那具舊提琴，拿的這麼仔細，這麼愛護，這才分明可以見到音樂正是他的酷好呢。</p>
<p>他只說道：「師母，我總盡我的力；」就將弓觸着弦綫拉過去，好像是急切要重聽那久寂的微音。</p>
<p>房間裹正在有一番哈嚷，然而乃德對其餘一切只如充耳無聞，他只輕揄慢撚為他自己演奏，快樂之極，竟不知有其他了。他所奏的原不過一個黑人所唱的曲調，正是沿街奏樂的人所常演的，然而這立刻引起了童子們的注意，立使他們靜了下來，直到他們都佇立諦聽，不勝驚奇地嘆賞。他們逐漸圍攏了他，裴先生也走近來仔細觀察！因為乃德恍然如魚得水，只管彈去，盡失其羞澀之態，到後來雙目亮得發光，雙頰紅得如發火，他的幾個瘦小的指頭在弦上不絕往來跳舞，他緊抱着那個老舊的提琴，借了它以他所最愛用的語詞來直向眾人的心裹談話。</p>

<p>我國台杯選手許承基、昨日在不絕之掌聲中、以二比一擊敗去年上海單打冠軍卡爾生亦即我國台杯隊之管理、成績四比六、六比三、六比四、雙方表演、俱極為精彩動人之至、足堪稱為上海本季之精彩網球表演、許在技術擊法上俱有顯著之進步、無怪觀者讚不絕口掌聲雷動也、尚有單打一組、張定釗二對零勝羅孝建、最後雙打許林合組、勝卡爾生史規亞不費氣力、昨日上午天雨、迄午始已、故觀眾略為減少、今日下午四時起、許在原地戰邱飛海、以昨日表演觀來、得勝當爲易事也、昨日成績如下、</p>
<p>許承基　四比六　六比三　六比四　卡爾生</p>
<p>張定釗　六比二　六比二　羅孝建</p>
<p>許承基林寶華　六比二　六比四　卡爾生史規亞</p>
<p>技術上顯著之進步</p>
<p>許承基昨日不但表演佳妙、且動作姿勢之美、亦極為動人之至、發球重而有力、得分者甚多、變　誤已絕罕見、發球已極有把握、雙角之對抽、深而極遠、網上殺殺、處處佳妙、其反手之　而有力、為最顯著之進步、卡爾生既非弱者、許處處佔卡之上、第一盤已極應得勝、對敵林邱、亦當能得勝無疑、目前之許、實不在日本平井等之下也、</p>
<p>卡爾生先勝第一盤</p>
<p>許先開秋、連下二局、其邊綫秋之佳妙、使卡爾生無法應付、其次三局、許連連試攻卡之反手、結果反為卡勝、卡反以三比二超出、許二角深遠之對抽、及重力之發球、亦奪回二局、又以四比三居前、形勢極為平均之至、但因第九局許發球局之失敗、第一盤遂為卡以六比四先勝、</p>
<p>許承基克服卡爾生</p>
<p>許承基不慌不忙、鎮靜非凡、各勝發球局成二比二、卡破許之發球、以三比二居先、此時許突見振作、其對角斜球之佳、一時無二、一氣呵成、連下四局之多、遂以六比三奪回第二盤、第三盤許仍佔上風、聲勢極佳、四比二復成五比三、已成必勝之局面、卒以六比四再勝第三盤、</p>
<p>羅孝建不敵張定釗　羅孝建張定釗登場、空氣為之緩和不少、張定釗之底綫抽、及正手重壓、使羅孝建無法應付、且羅之發球、重重疊疊、雙錯誤不可計、僅僅第二盤第二局曾有一番劇戰、結果張以二個六比二得勝、</p>
<p>許林雙打珠聯璧合</p>
<p>雙打許林搭配可稱珠聯璧合、二人殺球皆兇、發球亦重、加之對方史規亞四人中最　弱、卡爾生獨力無濟於事、林寶華更集中球點、向史規亞擊去、第一盤六比二、第二盤六比四、皆未曾經過劇戰也、</p>
<p>今日秩序</p>
<p>許承基　對　邱飛海　單打　三點</p>
<p>許承基卡爾生　對　林寶華朋納維區　雙打　四點</p>

<p>— 魏冰心</p>
<p>熱烈偉大的兒童年已開幕了。社會國家，將爲全國的小朋友謀切實的幸福，無窮的利益。小朋友們自然很興奮，很歡欣，也很盼望，感謝.作者趁這個千載難逢的機會，代替全國的小朋友，提出自己生活上需要的十項要求：</p>
<p>第一，要有充實的兒童圖書館。——生活在複雜的社會，知識飢荒，不能發展；學問貧乏，難免淘汰。兒童圖書館，是我們吸收知識，研求學問的機關。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們充實的兒童圖書館。</p>
<p>第二，要有寬大的兒童遊樂園。——生活在熱閙的都市，人烟稠密，空氣混濁；身體疲勞，精神煩悶。兒童遊樂園，是我們休養身體，安慰精神的塲所。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們寬大的兒童遊樂園。</p>
<p>第三，要有完備的兒童博物館。——學校設備，未必完全；紙上知識，未必正確。兒童博物館中陳列的物品，可以供我們隨時觀摩，證騐，獲得切實的學問。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們完備的兒童博物館。</p>
<p>第四，要有適宜的兒童體育塲。——增進健康，須重運動；發展體格，須重鍜鍊。兒童體育塲中設置的器械，可以供我們隨時學習，比賽，磨練强壯的筋骨。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們適宜的兒童體育塲。</p>
<p>第五，要有普通的兒童動物園。——在自然科中研究各種動物，必須觀察實物，印象才能深刻。所以要有兒童動物園，飼養各種飛禽，走獸，昆蟲，魚介，供我們察看形態，研究習性，實騐畜養的方法。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們普通的兒童動物園。</p>
<p>第六，要有觀賞的兒童植物園。——在自然科中研究各種植物，也要觀察實物，觀念才不模糊。所以要有兒童植物園，種植各種好花，異草，珍木，奇樹，供我們欣賞形態，研究功用，實騐栽培的方法。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們觀賞的兒童植物園。</p>
<p>第七，要有簡單的兒童美術館。——美術，是人類的文化結晶。專供我們鑑賞的美術館，陳列普通的作品，足以引起愛美的情緒，藝術的思想。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們簡單的兒童美術館。</p>
<p>第八，要有高尙的兒童電影院。——電影，是普通的業餘娛樂。專供我們觀覽的電影院，開映敎育的影片，足以增進知識的開展，生活的興趣。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們高尙的兒童電影院。</p>
<p>第九，要有正當的兒童戲劇社。——戲劇，是活動的藝術，可以鼓動情戚，娛樂身心。我們的戲劇社，由我們自己活動，排演故事或歌舞，給小朋友們看。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們正當的兒童戲劇社。</p>
<p>第十，要有普遍的兒童播音團。——播音，是新興的藝術，可以傳授學術，報吿時事。我們的播音團，讓我們自己工作，播送歌唱或演講，給小朋友們聽。可愛的社會國家，給我們罷，快給我們普遍的兒童播音團。</p>
<p>這十項要求，倘若在這一年內，完全能够實現；而且，是要全國普遍的，全體享受的，不是偏於一地方的區域，也不是偏於一階級的獨佔。那才不辜負國家規定兒童年的用意；那才是眞正爲我們謀切實的幸福，無窮的利益。自然，我們也得努力地修養品性，提高知能，鍜鍊體格，個個成爲有作有爲的公民，報答社會，報答國家。</p>
<h3 id="c169">夏禹治水的故事（歷史） <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>長江和黃河同時發生大水災，某處决口，某處淹沒，種種不幸的消息，不斷地從報紙上傳來；於是防水救災的問題，便成了目前最迫切的間題。說到防水救災，就連想起四千多年前夏禹治水的一段故事，介紹給小朋友們：</p>
<p>唐堯時候，各地洪水爲患，水勢非常浩大，連山陵也有浸在水要的，平地上更不用說了。人民都巢居樹上，或攀登高山，挨餓受凍，生活困苦極了。於是唐堯便叫鯀去治水。他築堤防以禦大水，可是水勢猛烈，堤防那要能擋得住，隨築隨破，所以治了九年，中國的水患仍舊不能平息。到虞舜時，把鯀殺掉，叫他的兒子禹，繼續父親的職務，再去治水，他知道父親築堤禦水的錯誤，便改用疏導的方法，把黃河，長江，淮水，漢水等疏通，使匯流到海裏去。他涉水登山，東奔西走，一刻也沒有空閒，在外八年，三過家門而不入。他治水能這樣專心，洪水之患，終於給地弭平了。</p>
<h3 id="c170">救救孩子！（時事談話） <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>八月一日，各地舉行兒童年開幕禮，多熱鬧啊！多高與啊！但是就在那天的報紙上，我們看到一件悲慘的新聞：北方有一個徐姓小學敎師，因爲生了肺病，竟買了一個窮苦人家的孩子，活烹了吃下。</p>
<p>小朋友，我報吿你們這一伴事情，是要你們知道：（一）一方面有人在舉行兒童年，高叫「替孩子謀幸　」，一方面却有人拿孩子來活活烹死，這梱社會是充滿着「矛盾」的。（二）做一個小學敎師，總應該有一點知識；但是他竟以爲吃孩子可肉可以治愈肺病。醫學常識缺乏到如此地步！小學敎師尙且如此，許多不曾讀過書的民衆更不必說了。我們由此可以知道：這社會裏的大多數人依然是很「愚蠢」的。（三）因爲要治自己的病，竟把人家的孩子活活烹死；像這一種只知有己不顧別人的人，决不止這一個，像這一穩忍心害理的事，决不止這一件，我們由此可以知道：這社會裏的許多人是「自私」的，「殘忍」的。（四）自己親生的兒女，除非萬不得已决不願出賣給人，讓人活活烹死的，由此我們可以知道：我們許多民衆的生活，已經「窮苦」到了極點。</p>
<p>我們幼小無力的孩子，生在這矛盾的社會要，「愚蠢」，「自私」，「殘忍」，「窮苦」這四個兇狠的惡魔，隨時隨地在殺害我們；但是，誰是我們的救星呢？</p>
<p>我們要團結起來，組織起來，和那些從事於兒童事業的大人們共同做下列的工作。（一）振濟災區兒童，（二）救濟貧苦兒童，（三）設立勞働托兒所，育嬰院，敎養院，（四）參加識字運動，灌輸民衆常識。</p>
<p>小朋友，我們住在這地獄一般的社會裏，我們要喚起大人們救救孩子，我們更要喚起兒童們自己起來救救自己！</p>
<h3 id="c171">你 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>

<p>你的功成名就，全靠着你，</p>
<p>你得敎育你自已，</p>
<p>你雖然有師長敎你，然而領悟却是在你，</p>
<p>你得約束你自己的舌頭</p>
<p>你得選擇你所要說的語言，</p>
<p>你得看定你自己的目標</p>
<p>你得解决你自己的一切問題。</p>
<p>你是你人格的創造者，</p>
<p>你不侮辱自己，沒有人敢侮辱你，</p>
<p>你不能被人給你升高或降下，除非你自己。</p>
<p>你得决定你自己的志向</p>
<p>你該知道這「兒童年」的立義。</p>
<h3 id="c172">氷淇淋與熱水瓶（常識） <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>喂！　位吃過冰淇淋的小朋友們！可知道冰淇淋是怎樣製造成的？或許不知道吧！讓我來吿訴一下，大約用冰塊和食鹽，按照二與一的比例混合起，放在牛奶鷄蛋等混合物的溶液外面，這時，一面冰塊化爲水，一面食盥溶解入水，都要吸收相當的熱量，所以結果使周圍的溫度，降低到攝氏零度下二十二度，因此將牛奶等凍結成爲固體一——冰淇林。它是因爲冰溶化成水，要吸收大量的熱，所以利用泳的溶化，可以遣成相當低的溫度，造成的原因，就是利用這個道理。</p>
<p>前天我到上海去遊玩，就買了一些泳淇淋，放在熱水瓶裏帶回來，到家倒出來一看冰淇淋一些沒有溶化，小朋友，可知道道是什麽道理？我先來講熱水瓶怎樣可以保持瓶內的水溫呢？熱水瓶因爲是複壁的玻璃瓶，又是壁間抽盡空氣，複壁內外又鍍以銀；理由因玻璃是不良導體，足以防止傳導作用，壁間抽盡空氣，足以防止傳導及對流的作用，內外鍍以銀又足以紡織瓶內熱的外逸和冷氣的侵入，因此瓶內放了冷的冰淇淋，也可以使外面的熱氣不侵入和瓶內的冷氣不外逸，不信，可以去試騐一下，住在鄉下的小朋友，可以照我的方法，帶家去給家裏的人，嘗嘗泳淇淋的滋味，同時，更可長進許多常識。</p>
<h3 id="c173">耕 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<h3 id="c174">飛機 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 冲</p>
<p>小朋友！我現在要介紹你們做一個玩意見，就是國防必需的飛機，這種飛機做起來是很好玩的。它在天空中也能飛行，在地上也能行動，假使你們不信，不妨照下面的說明做做看，或者和你的同學一同做，各做一個，做好了作一個「飛行比賽」，看誰的飛得快，不是很有趣嗎？</p>
<p>工具和材料：竹桿數節，鐵絲（鉛絲也可代用），小方鉛片一塊，約半方吋，橡皮筋（橡皮帶）二條，綫三尺，輪盤是用舊玩具上的車輪，絹（大的文具店內出售）。剪刀，小刀，橡皮，筆，墨，硯等，預備好了，然後做起來，做起來時侯，第一要細心，第二不要做得它兩面有輕重，有了這兩個條件，就不怕他不成功了。</p>
<p>做法：照圖甲用竹削成在機頭轉動的葉子。圖乙也是用竹削成的，做兩面翅膀。圖丙；要做兩根，做機身用的。圖丁；做機身尾部橫檔用的，它的上面裝兩個舉頭螺絲，（五金店內有出售，要買最小的），圖成；是用細鐵絲做的邊圈，再貼上簿絹，還機身後面的兩個翅膀，也照圖戊一樣做法。圖己；已裝成後的樣子。圖庚；是機頭的樣子。圖辛：是機尾的樣子，它的最後面，用　絲在後面的橫檔上接出，是代後輸用的。</p>
<p>尺寸，照圖上所註明的，或者可以隨你放大，或縮小，不過放大起來一定都要放大，不可以機身放大，而翅膀不放大，這樣是不成功的，若要縮小則反之</p>
<p>玩法：先把它橡皮筋轉緊，不要放它鬆脫，然後放在光滑的地板上，把手一放，它就能在地上行走了。若然要使它飛行，也可以。先要把上面的手續做好，然後再拿到二層樓的陽台上，把它在空中一冲，它就能向前的飛行了。</p>
<h3 id="c175">兒童年的精神食糧 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 綠叢</p>
<p>—介紹給成人們和兒童們—</p>
<p>兒童年不是宣傳年，而是要切實工作的實施年。需要實施工作，無論是成人和兒童，首先要充實自己的力量。有健康的體魄，堅强的意志，正確的思想，科學的頭腦，勞働的身手，豐富的智識……道樣，才能担負起重大的責任。像一個飢餓得奄奄待斃的人，你叫他去參加賽跑，簡直是笑話，現在的兒童，成人，無論怎樣健康，都是表面的，精神上的貧乏，誰都不能否認，在如今兒童年開慕的時候，我誠懇的爲大家提出這個問題，並且介紹幾種可以充實我們精神的糧食。</p>
<p>兒童年中的一般敎育和科學敎育怎樣實施？兒童應讀怎樣的書報？怎樣引導兒童去研究科學？關於今日之小學敎科書的意見？兒童書報刋物應怎樣編輯？兒童報館怎樣創辦？怎樣才能使兒童身體健康？生活改善？一般流浪兒童怎樣處理？兒童一切的問題，在兒童年中都需要有確切的研究和認識。中國兒童文化協會敦請了四十餘位專籌　了五個月的時間，　成了一本十五萬言的「今日之兒童」，由生活書店經售，在八月廿五日可以出版了，現在去預約，還有特別折扣，在經濟不景氣的今日，我敢介紹給讀者們去賞識。</p>
<p>在七八年以前，葉紹鈎先生的「稻草人」，開闢了中國童話的新路徑，但是，以後，這一條路徑，却又被國王，公主，的莽草埋沒了。日本的　本楠郎曾經說過：「新的兒童，一定要給予新的作品，他向着變化不停的新世界裏，不斷的繁榮滋長的。」我想，在我們國裏，何嘗不如此。我們看國內目前出版的兒童讀物，數量眞不少，可是在質量方面，實在太微弱了。</p>
<p>蘇聯的童話，曾經有幾本介紹到中國來過，最近譯文社又有這一本「錶」童話出版了，這是値得推　於兒童的新兒童們之前的。魯迅先生在序文裏說到有兩點；第一，是要將道樣嶄新的童話，介紹給中國的兒童，和家長，師長，以及敎育家，童話作家作參考.第二，想不用什麼難字來供給十歲左右的兒童閱讀。魯迅先生的熱心，多麽使我們感謝。我胆敢說，這是兒童年極適合於兒童優良禮物。</p>
<p>最後，我願關心兒童的大人們，都能稍有機會讀道本書。</p>
<p>請小朋友們注意：</p>
<p>（一）中國兒童文化協會於今日十二時至一時假新新電台（週波七八〇）播音，由愛華小學小朋友歌唱。杜也牧先生講「賣報孩子一的故事。何公超先生報告兒童新聞。又該會編輯之「今日之兒童」業已付印，定價六角，預約者得打八折（預約期八月二十日截止）。（二）兒童文藝雜誌第一期定本日二十日出版，內容異常精采，且刊載小朋友們之作品極多，全年二十四冊，連郵僅收大洋一元在出版前定閱，不必先付錢，且有圖畫故事小偵探兩集可送。這是極好的兒童讀物，可致函塘山路逢源里四十四—四十六號該社預定。</p>

<h3 id="c176">小鼓手（二） <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>小鼓手跟他跑上樓去，入到一間破敗的頂樓中，他見老大佐手中執着紙和鉛筆，身子靠在窗檻上，而他脚邊的地板上，放着一根長長的繩子。</p>
<p>老大佐將那紙兒摺了起來，把他那雙嚴冷的灰褐色的眼珠，注在小鼓手臉上突然說道：「鼓手！」</p>
<p>小鼓手的手舉在帽邊行了一個敬禮。</p>
<p>老大佐說：『你可勇敢麽』？</p>
<p>小鼓手的眼睛亮了一亮，答道：『是的，大佐』！</p>
<p>老大佐同他走到窗前，說道：『你向那邊望下去，見那法朗加別墅近邊的地上，有許多刺刀，在閃閃地發亮。那邊便是我們的軍營。你取了紙兒，從這繩子縋下窗去，像閃電般穿過了小山，奔過了田野，趕到我們的軍營中把道紙兒交給你所遇見的第一位軍官。如今且把你的腰帶和背囊卸將下來」。</p>
<p>那小鼓手卸下了他的腰帶和背囊，將那紙兒藏在胸口的袋中；軍曹從窗檻上，拋出繩子去，握緊了繩的一頭；老大佐扶着小鼓手爬出窗外，他的背兒向着田野。</p>
<p>老大佐說：『小心些，這裏一分隊的得救，全靠着你的勇氣和你的兩條腿』。</p>
<p>「大佐，請你信任我」，小鼓手回答着。一而從繩子上瀉將下去。</p>
<p>大佐握緊着繩子，又道：「落下去時，你得低低的蹲在地上」。</p>
<p>『請放心，不用怕』。</p>
<p>『願上帝助你』！</p>
<p>不多一會，小小鼓手已踏到了地上，那軍曹收起了繩子，立時走開去了，而老大佐刦站在小窗跟前，眼瞧着小鼓手奔下小山去。他希望此去沒有給敵人瞧見，但甚立刻有五六陣小小的雲烟，從地上騰將起來，他就知道那孩子已被奧大利兵發見，而從山頂上放槍射擊下來。那雲烟就是檢彈打在地上而飛起的沙土。但那小鼓手不顧一切，還是拼命的向前奔跑。停了一會，老大佐警喊起來道：『哎喲，死了』！但他喊聲未絕，早見那小　手已爬了起來。</p>
<p>老大佐不由得吐了一口氣道：『呀，原來是跌了一交』！</p>
<p>小鼓手仍在向前的跑，但是一蹺一拐的很不自在。</p>
<p>『他挫傷了他的脚了」，老大佐喃喃地說。</p>

<h3 id="c177">賑災與消災 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 珍妮</p>
<p>本報五日南京專電：「首都婦女賑災會分電致成都青島蔣汪夫人云，湘鄂贛魯皖豫閩各省，水災慘重，本會五日發起賑災會，謹請擔任發起人，懇即籌募賑欵，以濟災黎，并請電示一切，該會並發表宣言，請全國婦女界，一致倡導…………於必要時，派員前往災區調查各地災情。」</p>
<p>在此「婦女回家」的呼聲，高唱入雲的當兒，首都婦女仍能顧到家外事，而發起賑災會，確是一椿值得欣喜的事。不過我們以為與其說「必要時，派員前往災區調查」不如決請黨國要人夫人，親率優游在安樂宮裏的太太奶奶們，前往災區看看，要知道上流社會的太太奶奶們，本來嬌生慣養，不知人間苦難，借此可使他們知道人間地獄，正是咫尺間事，這樣也許可使她們省出一點消閒裝飾的費用，救活出幾個喘息於洪流中的災民！</p>
<p>其次，賑災固然是目前迫切的工作，但究竟是消極的。積極的，還是要人人能認識這災情的根源·尤其是婦女界，大都迷信，以為這是災民的命乖，而來個什麽祈禱會，消災經懺，這些不但不能消災，且徒然是勞命傷財而已。</p>
<p>我們知道大旱洪水，固然都是自然災害，但盡可由人力消弭，現在的所以沒此種力量，來與天災鬥爭，由於我國的積弱，與政治社會制度不健全的緣故，所以我們要永弭天災，還得首先健全我們的社會的主觀力量。</p>
<h3 id="c178">「北平男女分校糾紛」 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 梧</p>
<p>幾年來國土日漸消滅了以後，風化問題才鬧着響起來的。誰都知道：「風化」不能和「航空」一樣；直接使人感着是救國工作，然而各地仍不能不鬧。鬧到起勁起來，竟從「卑賤」的娼妓，飄零的歌女，直到所謂「身家清白」的女學生上面；許多人為這鬧得唇枯舌爛，算他們的精力，有了地方發落。</p>
<p>北平最是個愁雲密鎖的地方，而又多「燕趙悲歌慷慨之士」和東北離喪之民，他們那欲沖斗牛的憤氣，多不容易勒住！而今卻古井生波，袁市長硬給牠一個中學男女分校的主張，鬧得那兒風雨滿城，令人忘卻了燕巢危幕的境況。那些女同學由商科，師範科，職業科中途併入普通科，損失固然不資，然而究竟是「女人們」的小事，只要於大事便當，小事是顧不了許多的。</p>
<p>而且做事也得適應環境。整個中國尚且如此，何況北平？北平要那些有專門知識技能的，或較高的科學知識和較高的世界知識的女學生何用？遲早是要她們回到屋角裏去學「孝敬」的呀！男子教育已經踏上了的那根水平线，一時既是改不過來，可是女子是容易處置，呌她搬了出去就得。搬出去以後你愛在賢妻良母主義的女學唸書也罷，不唸也罷，東四省就沒有很多的女學生，更沒有男女同學的中學生；所以他們到處的叛變，就很少女的加入。</p>
<p>國家如果是想伸長脖子見天日。那麼，男女在一切的學問技能上都能同樣受業，社會可以多一批各項的人才，未始不是一個幫助。可是剛才說過：北平最是濃雲密佈的地方，最好是大家的脖子縮得低一點兒，才顯見得是太平盛世。這事又不宜真爽爽提倡，祇有一步步渾混做去：先從弱者的女界上發作，是比較容易妥貼。一聲呌女學生回到暗慘的，拘束的，簡陋的新設的女學校去，不由她們不依，打出了防淫甚於防……的理由，許多人也覺得「這是對了！」提倡都畢竟是心竅多幾個的偉人。</p>
<p>然而北平私中的代表，卻還在開會力爭，欲以維持「北平固有之教育成績」。這看來只是學校繁榮的問題，所以爭的只是學校當局·但，真實地說，卻是女子教育的危機，是婦女界莫大的威脅。好端端費了多年的苦爭，才得敲開男子的校門，給女子擠了進去，使她們在閉塞的在賢妻良母，裁縫烹飪之外多聽一點正經東西；今卻以莫須有的防嫌，定教女子退回轉去。若北平的事還可當牠是一椿「國事」，起來力爭的該是全國的女人和想見天日的男人。</p>
<p>如今起來力爭的只是北平男女同學的中學校當局，顯然給牠大事化了小事；小事將來自可化為無事，北平男女中學的分校，便將成為定　。我們脖子縮低來的情形，自可由北平以及其餘：於是而濃雲會鎖住全國，鎖住全國的女人和男人。</p>

<h3 id="c180">阿比西尼亞的婦女 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 羅瓊</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞從十九世紀末葉以來，在英法意三國角逐之下，早巳淪為半殖民地；到目前已和其他半殖民地同樣，有漸由半殖民地進而為殖民地的傾向，意大利就是這傾向的推動者。現在意阿爭執巳達到劍拔弩張的形勢，阿比西尼亞既不甘屈伏，意國復決心以武力為終始；戰爭的爆發，似乎已經只是時間上的問題了。</p>
<p>阿國自從去冬爭執發生以後，初則盼望國聯的公斷和非戰公約的制裁。但是美國既聲明不願干涉，英法又復各自為謀，不能共同維持國聯的威信。在這國際情勢支配之下，阿國當局只有兩條路可走，第一是向意大利屈膝求和，無條件地接受意大利的全部要求。第二是不惜任何犧牲準備一個英勇的民族解放戰爭。最近阿王的演說和阿國外交官的對外聲明，都表示着「甯願戰死疆場，不願喪失寸土」的決心，可見，阿比西尼亞正在走着第二條道路。</p>
<p>在這戰爭的狂熱之中，特別值得注意的是阿國婦女的態度，據本報七月二十八日哈瓦斯電「阿國婦女協助軍隊委員會，於本日下午在阿京開會，各軍事領袖均參加會議，決議組織團體，於戰時救護患病及受傷士兵」。同月三十日路透電，阿國女子準備於男子出征時，代替男子職務云。阿國婦女能在此民族危機深化的時候，毅然參加民族戰爭；這正好為半殖民地婦女樹立了一個行動的指標。</p>
<p>其次倘使阿國當局採取了前述第一條道路，那末在忍辱偷生的「睦隣」外交之下，難免不產生開倒車的「婦女回家」運動，即以家庭勞動來困鎖婦女，麻醉她們奮鬥的意識。不但阻止了婦女的解放，有時更會間接幫助帝國主義，使它得以一帆順風地推行其侵略政策，然而阿國政府現在採的是第二條路线，阿國婦女也英勇地同走上了此第二條路线。這是值得我們作為　鑑並感佩的！</p>

<h3 id="c181">第八講　帝國主義時代的婦女 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>第一節　世界大戰與婦女</p>
<p>自從十八世紀末產業革命開始以來，約一世紀間，世界的資本主義，雖則有時逢到不可避免的恐慌，但一般看來，的確遂行了順調的向上發展。產業組織的完成，生產技術的發達以及商品及勞動市場的統制等等都表現出資本主義的高度發展的形態。這樣遂進入於所謂「資本主義最後階段」的帝國主義時代。</p>
<p>不過，歐洲先進諸國自從十五世紀以來，在世界各處先後強佔為商品市場的殖民地，到了這時代便不能不重新瓜分。於是乎，資本主義所固有的內在的矛盾日益尖銳化，世紀經濟的主人公英國和新興的德國，發生白熱的市場爭奪戰；由經濟的競爭發展到軍備競爭，遂爆發了空前未有的世界大戰。</p>
<p>大戰的結果是怎樣呢？死者一千萬，負傷者二千萬，軍事費總額四千億元，歐洲的人民掙扎在毒氣和血海裏面的整整五年！在過去的歷史中，這是最慘酷的一頁！</p>
<p>可是，我們僅僅羅列這可驚的數字，還不能夠表現戰爭當時的悲劇的實情。真正慘痛的悲劇，與其說是演在戰績，毋甯說是演在後方。因為跑上戰线的兵士們，在「為着祖國而死是光榮」的美名下，縱令是飲彈而死，也不過是瞬間的悲痛，至於在後方的那些兵士們的母親，妻子，兒女們從出戰當時的生離死別，以至接到死報為止，流過多少斷腸的血淚，發過多少虛幻的夢想！在欲哭無淚的悲苦中活着，所謂「祖國的光榮」，與她們何干！她們要的是她們的夫或子生還！然而，這祇是絕望的幻想！長期的悲劇而已！</p>
<p>很顯然的，這一空前的流血慘劇是各國的大資本家們為着獲得商品市場，為着獲得更多的利潤而督促政府去發動的東西，但是他們却也打起「為祖國，為正義」的旗子，鼓動兵士們跑上前方去當砲灰！鼓動婦女們留在後方守秩序！當然，「愛國最高正義」！誰敢反對這個「正義」，誰就是逆賊漢奸！，不過，無數可憐的兵士們，都成了這「正義」，「愛國」等旗子底下的犧牲品！世界大戰的殘酷性乃在此點！</p>
<p>戰爭是不僅奪去了婦女們的丈夫及兒子，同時破壞了她們生活根據地——家庭！在平日丈夫或兒子是她們的經濟的「扶養者」，家庭的「主人」。但到此時，她們便成為無從依歸的孤兒寡婦了！許多的無產婦女們，為了延長這悲苦的生命，不得不尋找生活的路线！她們或者參加軍事統制下的軍需工業部門，做無限制的製造殺人工具的勞動，藉以茍延殘喘，或者流為隨軍的賣淫婦，甚至投入匪窟，投入革命隊伍。</p>
<p>本來，各國資本家政府為着間接鼓動前方兵士們的士氣，提出保障他們的家屬生活的問題。就是說，規定對兵士的妻，寡婦及孤兒給與金錢上的補助或者給與其他免費住宿等部分的特典。但這是「口惠而實不至」的特典。參加後方工作的婦女，雖能支持她個人的生命，但她的子女及老親等的生活却無從維持，因此在戰爭期中嬰兒死亡率急激增加，這樣，戰爭不但奪去了她們的丈夫，並且奪去了她們的子女。</p>
<p>在這種情勢之下，婦女們不得不成為社會的反動份子了。一九一五年春天，柏林的勞動婦女們起來歡迎革命領袖加爾，李卜乃希，攻擊賽德曼政府，同時實行反政府的示威運動。參戰諸國的婦女們，對於物價暴漲及殘酷的戰爭，提出了強烈的反抗。一九一六年巴黎的婦女，再三去破壞市場，掠奪石炭倉庫。一九一六年六月，奧地利的婦女們為了反對戰爭和物價騰的繼續到「三日間」的叛亂。在意大利，宣戰布告開始動員的時候，婦女們不願把她們的丈夫兒子送到死线上去，便以身體在火車路上築成人體防柵，阻止火車的進行，在俄國自彼得堡至莫斯科甚至波及於各地方的一九一五年四月的叛亂，其主動者乃是兵士們的妻。尤其一九一七年三月八日彼得堡勞動婦女的蹶起，成了俄國大革命的導火线。資本家政府對她們鼓吹「愛國心」的時候，她們的回答是「要奪麵包來給我們的孩子」！</p>
<p>這樣，婦女在大戰中經驗了慘苦的生活，堅決的反對戰爭！可是二十年後的現在，所謂第二次世界大戰又不可免　　到我們頭上了！據一般的情勢看來，這次的戰場恐怕是太平洋上，首當其沖的當然是我們中國！　說這次戰爭比前次還要慘酷，還要廣汎！我們婦女凈如何應付這可怕的大毀滅的慘劇？這是要嚴重考慮的大問題。</p>

<p>（四）</p>
<p>雪下得很大，地上已經積了一寸多厚，許多的腳跡在同一條路上深深地印着。乞丐三四個，四五個地走去又走來，雪地上時常發出西沙西沙的聲音。修珍提了一條臟褲子出來到河岸頭洗浣，河面上却浮滿了長闊的窗戶和笨重的木廚。她抬頭朝對岸望望，黑漆的　台門洞開着，工人們還在那里一塊塊地搬出來丟在河裏。她仔細地打量，那是誰的家呢，幾年來，竟有些記不起，從前，這台門雖原是黑，却沒有黑得這樣新，屋頂上，瓦片巳理得整整齊齊，牆壁刷得雪白，屋旁邊又建添了幾所平房。可是除了這家之外，就沒有比他好的房子了，不是舊的更舊，就是倒塌成了廢墟，靠山腳下的那座草棚只剩了幾根棟樑，在那裏歪斜地橫直着。</p>
<p>修珍剛洗好褲子起身，太公的兒子們抬了一籮白米來洗淘，擦過她的身邊，幾乎把她衝倒。她知道這米是去做年糕的，竟回憶起年糕的味兒，又聽得間壁篷篷搗年糕的聲音，愈引起她食欲的需要，她竟忍不住轉了個彎，刮了一眼太公家裏剛蒸熱放在臼中搗着的雪白柔韌的糕團。</p>
<p>修珍披滿了雪花進家門來，腳還沒有跨進，就看見她的嫂嫂在喂小姪兒的奶；大姪兒走近他的母親身邊，呌着要吃東西。嫂嫂瞥了一眼修珍。高聲的罵起兒子來：</p>
<p>——小鬼！你又走攏來啦！我有什麽東西可給你吃的？我只有我一個人！你要吃「你們大大小小就把我吃掉好了！」大姪子哭，喊，嫂嫂罵得更兇，恨恨的打了一頓，又把孩子一摔摔到門外的雪地上。西北風狂刮着，雪加緊的落着，洒到陷在雪堆裏的大姪子面上身上，好像園子裏露着半片葉尖的芥菜一樣。</p>
<p>修珍站着呆若木雞。這時，母親捧了一升小米回來；她見到倒在雪堆裏的孫子，忙把他抱了進來；小米却在這慌張的當兒撒了滿地，她扶着孩兒，一邊一粒一粒地拾米，一邊喃喃的說：</p>
<p>——性子這樣燥，就是要打小孩，也只可輕輕的打幾下屁股，嚇嚇他；不能這樣把他丟到雪地上！小孩凍出病來，不是又要着急？」</p>
<p>終究是自己的兒子，嫂嫂拿了一塊手巾來給大兒子揩淚拭雪了。</p>
<p>——是不是呢，自己撒污，自己受。」母親這樣說了一句。</p>
<p>嫂嫂却發了火了，她立即牽動着嘴角：</p>
<p>——我要打罵，我要疼愛，都是我自己的兒子，誰敢來話我？你會養孩子，你會教孩子，你怎麼不教養出一個好兒子來呢？」</p>
<p>——我什麽地方教養得兒子壞了呢！喏！我倒要問你了！」</p>
<p>——一個錢也不帶回來，連信也沒有一封，這是你的兒子啊！這樣的一個兒子，是你教養出來的啊！」嫂嫂說一句跨一步，指頭點着母親的鼻子。</p>
<p>——我的兒子這樣，不是我的不好，是你的命長得不好啊！那你的命為什麽不好一點呢？那末你丈夫會賺銅錢給你用。」</p>
<p>——是我不好？你老東西的老悔氣把你的兒子的好運道蓋住啦，是你的老命不好哪！</p>
<p>母親氣得說不出一句話，抖動着嘴唇，兩手伸伸，想撕媳婦的嘴，若不是修珍上前勸解，差不多要動打場了。一動打場，當然是母親吃虧。</p>
<p>嫂嫂怒氣未消，還是不斷的罵着：</p>

<h3 id="c184">人力車的存廢問題 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 史庸</p>
<p>在不久以前上海公共租界有一種改進市政交通的計劃，說要在幾年之內分期把人力車的數量漸漸减少，第一期先减少百分之幾十，漸漸使之滅跡，俾便利交通，减少市聲，增進人民幸福。减少人力車的反面，就是要提倡坐汽車，利用機器以代人力。如果有一天，居然有福氣輪到我們這輩人也可以爬上汽車階級的地位，那眞是有「小民何幸生當盛世」之感了！</p>
<p>在二十世紀提倡科學，利用機器，若不是頭腦冬烘的人，當然無有不加贊同的。利用科學的收穫，就是增加人生的幸福，這幾是不易的定理，並且我們還希望能有這麼一天，把所有從科學姑娘處得來的幸福，能普通地爲一般平民所享用。譬如說電吧，不僅有錢人家裏可裝電燈置收音機，就是貧民窟裏，窮鄉僻壤中也都有輝煌的電光閃爍着，悅耳的音樂聲瀰漫着，使整個空間光明，使全地球環繞着幸福的謳歌，同樣的，我們也希望有一天每一個人都有一輛福特廠的汽車，以後不但可不必勞動玉趾，而且還能節省時間，我們試設想這世界將是多麼的幸福啊！</p>
<p>所以在這一方面，公共租界當局的盛意是値得感謝的。但科學姑娘始終是生有一副高傲脾氣和勢利眼光，她只會在王孫公子貴婦小姐之羣中低聲正氣，恭執賤役，逢到貧窮的人，不要說欲親芳澤而無從，反而往往要受到她的刻薄和欺凌。當一九三六年式的福特車風馳電製的在眼前閃過時，我們所享受到的科學幸福就是滿鼻子的灰塵和煤烟。又如在我的故鄉，鄉人要進城裏，本來依賴四毛錢一趟的人力車，有一年，開設了汽油船公司，將所有人力車生意完全侵奪，人力車夫在飢寒交迫下，他們把人力與機器力一樣低價賤賣，就是說搭坐汽油船費二毛，人力車也只兩毛，這樣總算在人力與機器的竭力抗爭下，暫得賴科學的餘唾以茍延生命，然而多數的人力車夫終於被擠入失業羣中去了。</p>
<p>我們無法否認，從人力走到科學的路上，必然會有許多悲劇發生，但我們將用何種方法去避免科學的殘酷呢？這是値得研究的問題。</p>
<p>上海市人力車數量之多確實足以妨礙交通，叫囂的市聲確實足以使十里洋塲上的高貴人們聞而厭煩，然而我們得想一想，爲什麼人力車會有這樣的多？爲什麼車夫會願意幹這牛馬般的最勞苦低賤的生活？這裏又接觸到了嚴重的社會問題，經濟恐慌，工商業凋敝，失業增加，這一大串的事實，我們實無法閉了眼睛將牠一筆抹殺。我們贊成提倡科學，所以我們也贊成廢用人力車（却並不如某種慈善家爲人道主義而不坐人力車），但同時我們却堅决的主張：要想廢用人力車，對於數萬人力車夫及其家屬的生活問題應予以妥善的甚至根本的解决。</p>
<p>公共租界新政計劃發表不久，法租界爲人力車登記事，竟發生越捕越界擊傷車夫數十人之多的驚人慘案，人力車夫的命運，難道眞的不能逃出科學的殘酷殺戮嗎？嗚呼！</p>
<p>職業婦女的自白</p>

<p>— 白虹女士談</p>
<p>在幼年時候，我就咿咿啞啞的歡喜哼兩聲歌；所以像我現在那樣的一天到晚浸潤在歌舞裏，自己倒頗認爲是一椿適合個性的職業生活，雖然在歌舞上並沒有什麼成就。</p>
<p>記得我開始跨進歌舞的園地，是在六年前的一個春天，那時我才滿十三歲。照一般的情形說來，這麼一點兒大的女孩兒家，是决沒有離開家庭而去遷就她的嗜好的機會；但出乎意外的，我却這樣的做了，而且還是從那封建意識非常濃厚的舊家庭裏脫身出來，這眞可算得我短短生命史上的一頁奇蹟了，無怪我至今還不願意把牠忘記的呢！</p>
<p>在這六年的悠悠歲月中，我所想學習的東西並沒有完全學得，固然有點感到美中不足，但從此却踏上了生活目給的征程，這是聊堪自慰的。</p>
<p>說到我的家庭狀况，我簡直連想都不願去想牠，雖然牠對於我並沒有什麼惡感；所以自從我來上海以後，對家庭的印象似乎已逐漸跟着消逝去的時日一同消滅了。現在我只記得我是一個屬於正黃旗（滿清皇室的一個支流）的旗人；靠着先人的武功征服了漢族的餘蔭，我們這一支流便也得着了享受貴族生活的優遇；但不曉得從那代祖先手裏，才從沙漠遍野的蒙古包中遷居到北平。</p>
<p>據說當時一班皇室宗親—當然我家裏人也在其內—的生活很是頹廢無聊，他們簡直是整天的遊手好閒，也可說是沒有事做。他們衹是追求各人的嗜好：逛胡同，養鳥雀，鬥雞，跑馬，年紀大一點兒的人就在家裏種花，着棋，或者約三兩個年紀相等的上茶館去品茗，吃酒，到書塲去聽書或到大戲館去聽戲。無窮盡的光陰便都消磨在這些上面，直到他們死時爲止，然而後一代的人却仍會承先人的遺志，繼續的努力。這樣，直到清祚告終時，他們生活的形態方跟着無情的環境有些異樣了。</p>
<p>我父親也是這班皇室宗親中一個頭腦裏充滿了封建意識</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的典型人物，一切什麼新的事物，在他看來都是像洪水猛獸似的可怕。雖然對我路進歌舞界沒有加以阻止，但這無非是因爲給不幸的命運支配了他的意識的緣故，不然，也許我這時還是「深閨獨處」哩！不過，一樁事的成功，有時也得要有客觀環境的凑合。譬如：若不是我們的家庭「家道式微」了，父親的思想决不會改變；再，如沒有母親的慫　，他也决不願放下他尊嚴的面孔，自動地，讓我去從事歌舞生活；而且明月歌舞社若不是在那時遠征到北平，我就是想從事歌舞也會「不得其門而入」的。</p>
<p>在北平和我同時報名加入明月社的有黎明健，英茵諸人，除了英茵比較年長一點，其餘都是十一二歲的女孩子。現在英茵已經脫離明月社而另有她的前程了，但我和黎明健還是繼續在一塊兒相親相愛的，我們彼此都認定歌舞是終身的事業，並希望明月社能在我們手裏發揚光大起來，如果不遭到意外的打擊的話。我們道一羣孩子自在北平加入以後，不久便隨着這類似「馬戲班」的集團離開北平轉往靑島去了。到靑島公演了一次，在那裏我開始了「處女」登裏，不過因爲不是重要的角色，所以當時也並不曾引起人們的注意。在靑島勾留沒有多時，這大隊的人馬便浩浩蕩蕩地投奔到上海來；從那時起才開始了上正軌的學習時期。</p>
<p>黎錦輝先生那時對我們這班在北平加入的新社員是懷着莫大的希望，所以一切的舞蹈差不多都是他親自敎授。他在敎授社員學習歌舞時，態度是非常的嚴厲，擺起一副道學者的面孔，像私　敎師般的督率般的社員練習她的功課：明月社第一個社員徐來女土，能在現代的影壇享有那樣的盛名，也是因爲受了他很多的影響。他對於社員的生活方面都能像對待自己的子女般的注意；他認黎明健做乾女兒，就是因爲怕她的生活會感到難受的孤寂的緣故。</p>
<p>我剛進明月社時的第一步的功課，便是要習簡單的歌唱；一天到晚喞　喳喳地哼着玩，也沒有人來加以禁止。六個月以後，才開始學習基本的舞　；敎員—錦輝先生—總是跟在一邊看着，有一點不對的地方他便起來糾正，而且自己還做些姿式出來。這門功課似乎比歌唱難點，當時我有這樣的感覺；原因是對於歌唱我在學校裏就習慣了，但舞蹈却沒有多的機會學習；所以到這裏來開始學習舞蹈，步子自然顯得生硬，加之敎員寸步不離地跟着督率，視覥的心理更助長了動作的慌亂。這樣受了好幾天的罪——我當時是這樣想—以後，週遭的環境似乎不同了，一切都變成了舊識，視覥的心理也風流雲散；從此每遇一個新的舞蹈出來，只要經過一兩次的指授，便心領神會了。</p>
<p>造就一個新的人才，也和一個石人雕刻一件器皿相彷彿，匠人固然是要有高深的技巧才可以表現他的藝術，然而這塊材料却也要能供得起匠人的琢磨；學歌舞就是這樣，看起來像是輕而易舉，淺薄無聊，可是敎起來和學起來却都不容易。我在這裏經過了一年多的學習，自己却仍不敢相信究竟能有好多的心得，雖然這時已經在學戲劇的演技和關於歌劇的理論的課程。</p>
<p>明月社以前是黎先生領導，現在也還是他在領導，不過現在更增加了幾位導師，如黎錦光先生等人，所以內部組織上和管理上比以前更要科學化一點。不過，在這裏値得說的，就是社裏的財政是公開的，生活是有紀律的；社員對社應盡純粹的義務，同時也有絕對的權利。譬如我們是黎先生敎導出來的，現在我們對後加入的社員就要盡同等的義務；因爲這樣，社裏才可以减少一筆請敎員的開支。現在這裏有新舊社員三十多人，每月經常的開支要好幾百元；我們的社團不是資本組合，也沒有經濟的背景，我們要維持這社團的長成，就祗有靠大家對外公演的收入來津貼社裏的開銷。所以我們在這裏是祗有生活，沒有酬報；社員的食宿都由社裏供給，社員轉來的錢—如電台播音的收入—也都算是社的進欵。如果每月開銷有點剩餘，大家才有錢可分；像上次在新光公演「花生米一，每人各分得了三塊多錢。</p>
<p>我們在這裏當社員的生活形態彷彿有點軍隊化—不，簡直是軍隊紀律化。可不是嗎？軍人在國家多事之秋，有時是沒有餉可拿而要在疆塲用命；我們當這歌壇沉寂的時期，也一樣是沒有錢可拏而還得爲歌舞努力的。早晨五點鐘起床，就要張開嗓子練習歌唱，這不也和軍人黎明起來上操是同樣的情形嗎？從五點鐘練習至八點錢，才吃早餐；九點鐘上課直到十二點鐘吃午飯，中間祗有半小時的休息；下午從一點至五點，又和上午一樣的「如法泡製」，晚上九點　吹了熄燈號，才得着了較長時的休息。不過要上電台播昔的，却是例外。</p>
<p>我的生活經騐並不很豐富，所以要想說，似乎又沒有什麽値得可說的了。不過在我跨進歌舞界的六年中，曾隨着明月社往南京，漢口，靑島，無錫，蘇州，等處公演，過着流浪式的生活，得到　不少好的批評，同時也受到過很多辛辣的諷刺。這些個人的毀　，本來是一個從事藝術的人所應該遭遇到，是不足揚懷的；但中國的歌舞界奮鬥了十多年，還祗能引起三數位批評家（？）的注意，却使我感到莫名的悵惘！像上次我們在新光戲院公演時，那些自命爲時代前鋒的批評家，却說我們是在　大　，用這種淺薄的眼光來解釋歌舞，眞要使我們簪歌舞界放聲大哭呢！</p>

<h3 id="c186">歐洲的海軍問題 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 可成</p>
<p>德國的宣言重整軍備不僅使法意大感不安，卽被稱爲海上覇王的英國也覺得形勢有些不妙。因爲照現狀看來，德國重整軍備的結果，其空軍勢力要駕凌於英國之上，這是不消說的了；同時就是英國海軍的傳統的所謂二個標準主義亦將有不能保存的危險。所以在德國宣言重整軍備之後，英國就不得不在海軍問題上多加思索，而很快地拿出適當的對策來。</p>
<p>本來，自拿破崙戰爭以後，掌握世界覇灌的英國到十九世紀之末業已採用了海軍的二國標準文義，即是英國必須保有世界最大的兩個海軍國所共有的海軍力量。一八九八年四月德國從事大的海軍建設，隨後又大加擴充，及至一九〇九年，德國的海軍力量幾乎可與英國的相等了。那時在野的英國保守黨首領包爾溫在議會中曾說英國海軍早已沒有了二國標準文義的資格，隨即英國便放棄二國標準主義，承認了十六對十的英德海軍比率。這便是英國海軍的二國標準文義所遭到的第一次的打擊。後來因爲世界大戰的結果，德國海軍全被摧燬，英國方慶其海上覇權於茲可以長期穩固。但是不幸的是美國勢力在大戰中發展了起來，以其巨大的財政力量來積極擴張海軍，使英國感到無能與其競爭的苦痛。於是在華盛頓會議中英國終於承認了英美海軍均等的條件。但在歐洲方面英國仍保有二國標準主義，卽英國仍具有歐洲最大的兩個海軍國法意所共有的海軍力量。現在，德國旣已宣言重整軍備，其勢必將繼續與列强在擴充軍備上競爭；英國有見於此，爲要保存其在歐洲的二國標準主義，所以便很快地與德國進行了海軍談判，結果是成立了英德海軍恊定。</p>
<p>在英德海軍協定中規定着德國海軍永遠保有對英的三成五的力量。這樣在德國方面便算是在實際上廢除了凡爾賽和約中的軍事條欵，獲得了重整軍備的權利；同時英國於此也得到了在海軍方面永遠對德國佔優勢的比率，而且保持了法德意的均勢，也就是保持了英國海軍在歐洲的二國標準主義。所以當英德海軍協定的消息傳出後，倫敦和柏林都一致宣傳其政策的勝利。但是法國和意大利對此却不甚開心，巴黎的政治家都一致宣稱英德海軍恊定是遠反凡爾賽和約與三月二日的倫敦宣言的。這種反對英德海軍協定的空氣，直到現在還保存着。</p>
<p>華盛頓會議亦决定法意對英美的海軍比率爲三成五，法人雖對此决定積極反對，但直到現在法意所共有的海軍勢力仍未能超出英國之上。現在法國的海軍勢力爲五十六萬噸，意大利則只有三十七萬噸。若依凡爾賽和約的規定，德國海軍的總噸數只能有十五萬餘噸。但是英德海軍協定成立後，德國海軍卽可增至四十二萬噸，馬上就可新造三十萬噸的新式軍艦。這麽一來，德國的海軍力量便可興法國的相等，若與意大利比較起來，則它更是佔着很大的優勢。由此可見法意之反對英德海軍協定確是有其重大原因的。就目前形勢看來，歐洲的海軍問題將會因英德海軍協定而引起更多的糾紛，在這糾紛中必然會使列强競爭擴充海軍走入最危險的境地。事實上法意已經正式表明了牠們不一定會遵守華府條約所規定的對英美的三成五的比率，茍活列强競擴海軍的趨勢於此巳明白表露出來了。</p>
<p>同時，法意在反對英德海軍恊定一點上雖有某種的一致，但在海軍問題中牠們仍是有很大的衝突的。事實上意大利是堅持法意海軍均等的主見。其理由是：意大利的人口比法國的多，其海岸綫亦比法國的長，其重要都調理都是臨近海岸的，非有强大的海軍不足以防衛；同時法國所需的鐵，石炭，石油等物都可從陸路運來，意大利則必須仰給於海外的供給，所以意大利的海軍必須與法國的均等。然而在法國看來，法國是世界第二的有廣大殖民地的國家，其本國也是臨近北海，大西洋，地中海的，沿海各地都有受敵國艦隊襲擊的危險，而且，一旦有事，法國還須從非洲招致黑人軍隊來；因此法國堅决反對法意海軍均等的主張。在過去華盛頓會議中，爲了法意海軍均等問題曾發生了許多爭論，這爭論直到現在還是繼續着，而且，就在今後的軍縮會議中，海軍會議中，這個均等問題亦將是無法解决的間題之一。</p>
<p>當華盛頓會議時，在歐洲方面主要的只有英法意三國的爭論，德國在當時還未準備重整軍備，在歐洲的海軍問題的爭論中德國可說還是局外人，但只是英法意三國的許多爭論，也已够使歐洲列强的政治家們頭痛了。如已經說過的，英國的所謂二國標準主義，意大利的與法國均等的主張，法國的反英反意的意見，便是相互衝突的；就在這相互衝突中，使歐洲的政治家費盡心血，鈎心鬥角的結果，也絲毫不能解决歐洲的海軍問題；徒使糾紛日多，形勢日益嚴重而已！現在，德國又毅然宣言重整軍備，英德海軍協定已經成立，不消說，今後德國必會成爲歐洲海軍問題中的主要爭論者之一，而問題之將會更加複雜，更加嚴重，也是我們所可斷言的。</p>

<p>— 紹韓</p>
<p>好月亮—剛在東邊露出半個臉兒，大地便覺光明了。她那美麗的品瑩的眼波移轉到中囪的北方，斜睨着彰德車站；那兒的一切動的，靜的，樂的，悲的，都一齊映入她的眼簾</p>
<p>豐衣足食的人們，在自家的天井裏，砲樓上，安置香花，菓品，歡迎一年一度上新裝　　　，剎那　燈燭輝煌，爆竹震天的響，於是歡迎的儀式完成了。一會兒又另換一個塲面：朱紅的圓棹上陳列着新鮮的茶點，展開了豐美的酒筵；在道家庭的太平席上，大人們的態度十分悠閒，孩子們的臉上湧着無限快樂。當他們舉杯望明月的時候，覺得人生是美滿的，家庭是甜蜜的。可是同在這皎潔的月光下，同在這快樂氣氛的環境中，却另有一一幕悲劇恰要開演。</p>
<p>緊傍着月臺的一家小小招商—胖子客店，半月前來了一對年靑夫婦，號簿上的姓名是：「李二，王六姐。」他倆不是行商，仕宦，也非江湖浪客，行動是組俗的，談話十足的泥土味。住店後，沒有親戚往還，沒有朋友照看，在這熱閙的人世間，他倆是孤零零的！</p>
<p>十幾天的過程中，六姐總是愁苦着臉，蜷伏在鴿範似的耳房裏，悄悄的流淚，短嘆！李二好像避免一樁禍事，每天都是打早的鑽出客店，有時直到黃香纔疲乏的拐了回來。今天又是一早出門，這時還不見他的影子！</p>
<p>六姐孤單單的坐在板床邊，睜着灰暗的眼睛，痴呆的望着微弱的煤油燈光。彷彿定了神，又像失掉了知覺。當外面的爆竹聲送進冷僻的耳房時，她纔　覺的轉過頭。剎那間，爆竹連二接三的響了起來，好像禁不住情感的衝動，她歇斯底里的走到門邊，掀開竹簾向外探望。這時月色分外明亮，天空沒有一片雲舉，眞是一個美麗的夜。後來爆竹的聲音　漸嘶啞，單調，終於兩聲一聲的消沉了。</p>
<p>大地是靜悄悄的，祗有遠處孩子們的歌聲，在沉靜的空氣中起了一點小小的波動。可是那歌聲似乎有傳染性，不久近處的孩子們也附和起來了，於是一字一句很淸晰的送進六姐的耳朶裏：</p>
<p>「月兒光，月兒圓，一</p>
<p>一家大小好團圓。</p>
<p>妹妹吃月餅，</p>
<p>弟弟學猜拳。</p>
<p>可憐隔壁王二嬸，</p>
<p>丈夫一去不復還！」</p>
<p>這平凡的歌，頑童們胡　的歌，竟使六姐的心弦的動，竟勾起她回億到悲慘的往事。</p>
<p>她想起，年關前，因着租，債的逼迫，生活的鞭笞，終於使她割開母子之愛。把那親生的，養了五歲的小牛子，換得了孫寡婦的五十元大龍洋！除了繳付租，債，還剩二十元。夫妻倆捧着這一傷心的數目，仍是披星戴月的玩着泥塊，也有時在家裏看着壁上積滿了塵埃的關王神像，希望田王多給他倆一點收穫，希望田土償還一切損失。可是，時間輪轉到今年的五六月間，蒼天沒有一滴雨酒在地面，眼見得麥穗乾枯了，玉黍焦黃了，夫妻倆的血汗依然白費，一切希望</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>都像泡沫一樣消失。到了七月稱租的時候，田裏顆粒無收，家裏顆粒無存，賣兒的錢早用完了，再沒有兒子可賣了！然而張大戶的租，夫妻倆以後的生活又將如何呢？結果只得逃出了世代遺傳下來的故鄉，跑到遠隔數百里的彰德來。……</p>
<p>悲慘的往事原就緊緊繫住六姐的心，更兼在這中秋佳節，見着別家的歡聚，聽着別的孩子那種活潑的歌聲，愈挑動起她痛子思家的心情，她禁不住全身酸痛，軟綿綿的倒在床上。</p>
<p>當她昏迷迷的將要走入夢境的時候，門板突然呀的一聲響了，她警覺的抬起頭，纔發現是自己的丈夫。於是勉強掙扎着僵硬的身軀，走到他的身邊：「幹嗎這時才回來？」</p>
<p>對方沒有回答，疲乏的坐在那隻跛脚凳上，憂鬱的臉色，失常的表情，使她大大的驚異。</p>
<p>「今天怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「沒有什麽，」李二勉強鎮靜的說，隨卽在身上摸出四個月餅，遞了三個給她，「今天是團圓佳節……」語音十分哽澀，終於咽住了。</p>
<p>六姐拿着月餅，仿彿失掉了知覺，眼睜睜望着丈夫，一眼也不　。</p>
<p>經過許久的沉默，李二纔輕輕的走到六姐身邊，左手搭在她的肩上，右手按住自己的胸口。</p>
<p>「六姐，咱們夫妻……」他神經質的哽咽起來，兩隻潮濕的眼睛，散出恐怖的光芒。</p>
<p>六姐霍地站了起來，驚疑的問：「幹嗎啦？你今天……」</p>
<p>李二遲疑了一陣，終於忍痛似的說：「六姐，我今晚要走了。……」他在身邊摸出一個紙包，「這三塊錢，你好好的收着。」</p>
<p>「到那兒。……」</p>
<p>「保定。——今天我跑到礦上守了一天，仍然沒有希望。前天還歇了幾個人，我想再等也沒辦法。」李二呼了一口長氣，「我想橫順是死，回來在路上碰着招兵的，我就補了名字……」</p>
<p>「你當真要去？我……」六姐突然「哇」的一聲哭了出來，兩手緊緊的捏着他的衣襟。</p>
<p>李二舉止失措的，一面扯起破布衫替她揩眼淚，同時自己的眼眶里也滾出一股一股的淚水來：「不要哭啦！有什麽辦法？難道咱們倆眼睜睜的餓死！你想，咱們跑到這兒來快要二十天了，天天都在找工作，什麽煤礦公司，麵粉廠，貨棧，都守候遍了。可是……」</p>
<p>六姐這時稍覺清醒，細想丈夫的話確也不錯：當兩人逃來彰德時，以為這兒有鐵路，煤礦，麵粉廠，祇要自己不好吃懶做，定能找得工作的；誰知一天，兩天，直到現在仍是雙雙的閒着；眼見得衣服賣盡了，店賬也欠了不少，難道真的一同餓死嗎？想到這兒，她同情他，原諒他。但是他倒乾脆的走了，剩下自己，怎麼結局？於是又感覺十分的悲哀，竟放聲大哭起來：「你倒走了，我又……怎麼……？」</p>
<p>李二的態度十分窘迫，心里好像有無數的針刺，許久許久繼迸出慘痛的聲音：「你嗎？……我已經同老胖商量了，他可以照顧你……」</p>
<p>六姐剛張開嘴巴，門外忽然響着一句生疏的呼喚：「李二。」跟卽掀開門簾，現出一個穿軍裝的漢子。他向六姐瞟了一眼，纔對着李二說：「十二點一刻，趕「七十二次」車，一定要到。」</p>
<p>「是。」李二機械的應着。</p>
<p>屋內馬上一陣淒慘的哭泣！</p>
<p>車站上的大鐘，長短針快要指着「Ⅻ」字了。天空的中央懸着一輪溜圓的皓月；宇宙沒有一絲　　，大地上一切隱秘都裸露在皎潔的光波里。這時胖子客店的門口站着一男一女；月亮的寒光下男人的臉色分外慘白，全身戰慄得像　痙攣，女人微倚在他的身上，彷彿已經失掉知覺，臉色是青的，身體是軟的。就這么站立了五分鐘。車站上的鈴聲響了，汽笛發出第一聲喊叫了，男人忽然一個警覺，倐的把女人掀開，嘴巴一張一合，胸口一張一弛，好像是要說話，又像是在呼吸，兩眼遲笨的凝視她，不知是愛是恨。這時矮門口立着一個中年胖子，兩手叉腰，頭部一搖一擺的，好像在看一件有趣味的事。男人忽然掉頭向那胖子，哀懇似的說：「老板，請你好好的照顧她，不要把她賣……」</p>
<p>「你放心。」胖子的聲音例外的溫和，「快去，快去！」</p>
<p>「嗚！嗚！……」火車發出一聲長的悲鳴，車站上祇見着人在擁擠。那男人突然抱住女的，吐出沙啞的聲音：</p>
<p>「六姐……」哽咽的不能成聲，祇是兩眼望着天空的圓月。</p>
<p>「叮鐺，叮鐺！」車站上響着最后的鈴聲，他忽然掙開女人的兩手，瘋狂般的往站上跑去，她踉蹌的跟在後面，不到三步便「哇」的一聲栽倒地下！</p>
<p>這時，對面煤礦公司的砲樓上正有人挾妓賞月，琴聲激昂中，一個姑娘哼出一句平貴別窑：「害得我……夫妻們……兩……離分……。」</p>

<p>— 逸</p>
<p>巴西桑彭羅通訊</p>
<p>巴西是南美的一個物產豐富地域廣大的國家，英美等國在此都有巨大的投資，所以現在巴西在名義上雖然還是獨立國，但在實際上其政治經濟是為英美等國所支配的。這里的居民共有四種：在柯倫布未發現美洲以前就住在這兒的印第安人，以後移殖來的歐洲人，由歐洲人當作勞力輸入來的非洲黑人，以及混血的雜種。現在，除住在偏僻地帶的未開化的印第安人外，這些不同的人種，都是在一個政府，一個語言，一個宗教（巴西是一個舊教國）之下統一着的。因此，要明白地指出其獨特的國民性，實很困難；但是，如果能注意考察，那在許多地方也是可以看出所謂巴西人的風俗習慣與人情的。</p>
<p>首先值得注意的，是巴西人對於他們的賓客和訪問者的厚情。假使你去訪問巴西人的話，那他們便要努力知道你喜歡什麽，從而更在各方面盡量使你感到舒適和樂趣。有一位到南美去過的法國人曾說：「我們無論是在阿根廷與智利或秘魯都備受歡迎，但在巴西所受的待遇比任何地方都好，簡直像是在自己家庭中一樣。」</p>
<p>巴西人是很熱情的。不僅在男女兩性的愛戀中，就是在一般同性朋友的友情中，他們的熱烈的情感表現，也有些異乎尋常。在巴西，假使有兩個相別了兩禮拜的朋友一旦見面時，那他們在情感上所表現出的驚喜，親切，便會比相別了十年的其他地方的人的朋友見面時所表現的還要超過；他們不僅要熱烈地握手，而且還要擁抱，歡躍。在這里的街頭上你可以常常看到兩個男子狂歡地擁抱在一團，但他們是僅僅別了兩禮拜未見面的普通朋友，並不是多年不見的關係深切的人。有人說「巴西人的性格是柔和溫厚，恐怖粗暴」：這在某一點上說來的確是正當的評論。</p>
<p>對於巴西的自然美與未開發的富源，巴西人也很愛好：第一個巴西的國民，都熱望着他們的國家日益發展，用自己的力量去開發其富源，使其國家在世界上佔優越的地位。但是——在英美等國的政治經濟勢力控制之下，如果在根本上不經過一次巨大的變動，他們的希望是不會成為現實的。近年來，由於客觀事實的刺激，有些比較進步的巴西人也看到了這一點，所以他們對於英美等國也就漸漸地不大「厚情」了。</p>
<p>但是，一般說來，巴西因為特產豐富，易於生活，所以巴西人的一般性情都較懶惰，缺少艱苦奮鬥，勤勉上進的意志。本來今天就可做完的事情，一般巴西人總是延到明日乃至後日再去做。巴西人中少有偉大的成家立業者，其主要原因當然在於巴西的文化落後，在於英美等帝國主義的侵略阻礙了牠的發展，但其國民的懶惰的惡習也是不無關係的。</p>
<p>比較起牠的廣大的土地來，巴西乃是一個人口稀少的國家。但是，由於資本主義的發展，巴西國內也有很大的城市，而且其繁華的程度並不在於歐美各國的城市之下。如約德卡勒，就有二百萬的人口，桑彭羅也有人口百多萬。在這樣的大城市中，也和在歐美的大城市一樣，有無綫電播音，有很大的飛船飛行於空中，有三十多層高的洋房，有成羣結隊的汽車，有電影，音樂，當然也有摩登男女，也有叭兒狗。</p>
<p>從桑彭羅乘車向北行，經過一些時長後，巴西的都市氣便消失了：在車的兩旁都是廣大的咖啡地；出現於眼前的房屋，也不是三十多層高的現代的建築物，而是粗陋的平房了；草原上有許多牧牛的男人，大都有幾十頭牛在其周圍。一到車站，那便更有趣了，在這裏你可以看到許多跨在騾馬背上的混血的半黑的女郎，特地來迎接她們的丈夫；待到她下了騾馬，接到從車上下來的丈夫時，必要發狂似的地與之作熱烈的悠長的擁抱。火車在這樣的地方開或停時，不是鳴汽笛為號，而是打鐘：當停車的鐘聲傳出，火車停止在一個車站時，乘客們除紛紛下來觀看這些地方的風色外，許多都要乘興飲一杯極黑濃味的咖啡。</p>
<p>假使你由巴西的大城市走到農村，那你定會驚奇地感到你是到了另一個世界。因為這里的農村不僅沒有高大的建築物，不僅在物質的設備上與城市的大不相同，而且在社會關係，生活情況方面，都要較城市的落後一兩個世紀。巴西的鄉人在農村中主要地是耕種咖啡，但咖啡地的所有主乃是封建時代的王侯。因此，巴西的城市雖已現代化了，但其農村還是停留在封建時代中。在這樣的農村中當然是封建的地主支配一切的，所謂法律，公理，在這兒都沒有存在的意義，一般人並不知道這些；被人承認的只是上帝和封建地主們的權威。</p>
<p>巴西人喜歡跳舞，每在他們耕作疲乏時卽行跳舞起來。有時候他們奏着悅耳的音樂，大肆歡跳。如果外國人到那裏去奏音樂時，更為他們所高興。在跳舞之際，這兒的婦女常愛把那從土耳其人處得來的美妙的織物披在頭上，與青年男子狂熱跳舞，有時甚至通夜沉醉於跳舞中，不去睡眠，待到天明，鸚鵡歌啼了，牝牛叫喚了，然後才終止其狂熱的跳舞。</p>
<p>賭博和酒也是巴西人所特別愛好的。無論在街頭，在一般廣場中，都可以看到巴西人在賭博；除此之外，在這兒還有許多大賭場，其建築與設施都是非常富麗堂皇的。至於他們好酒的程度，也與其愛賭的程度成正比例。他們可以一天不吃麵包，但却不能一天不飲酒。他們所飲的酒，多半是由甘蔗製出來的強烈的燒酒，這與他們的溫情的性格似乎有些不大相稱，但事實上確是如此的。不過，好酒的巴西人有種好處，就是他們與美國人俄國人乃至中國的酒徒不同，他們飲醉之後，卽安靜地去睡覺，不麻煩，不找人撕打，不在馬路上亂叫亂吵，不發酒瘋。</p>
<p>巴西政府也經營彩票，普通的共有兩種：一種是一週一次的小彩票；費去一元或二元錢買得這彩票一張，卽有得一萬元或二萬元的希望；另一種則是一年一次的，用百元錢買得這種彩票一張，卽有得到六七十萬元的希望。巴西人之愛買彩票，也不亞於他們的好賭好飲。幾乎每一個巴西人都是彩票的經常的購買者，無論是出去散步，會友，或飲咖啡，巴西人都是不會忘記買一張彩票歸來的。</p>

<p>專述</p>
<h3 id="c189">華僑在全世界（六） <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>明中葉之季，西班牙人佔領菲律賓島。其後對於在菲島華僑即大肆壓迫，一六零三年因華人與西班牙人在馬尼拉衝突。華人死者竟達二萬三千人之多；一六三八年西班牙人又殺害華僑三萬三千人；一六六零年鄭成功取台灣後，華僑因乘機起義，事敗，幾全部被西班牙人所慘殺。及至菲島歸美後，美政府又實行嚴禁華工來菲。所以，中國興菲律實雖然關係很深，但在菲華僑的人數反不如在暹羅越南等地的多。要不是十九世紀之初菲律賓對西班牙革命的失敗，西人傾全力去壓迫菲人，華人得以乘機紛紛來菲，恐怕菲律賓還不會有華人存在的。但直到而今，全菲島的華僑也只有十萬左右的人數。</p>
<p>但是，華僑在菲島的工商業方面却頗佔勢力。舉凡在該烏的可可，烟草，苧蔴，椰子，木料，疋頭，糖果等業都與華僑有深切的蘭係。呂宋中部的米業，據美政府調查，各處共有　米三十一家，而爲華僑所經營者竟佔二十八家之多。在許多華商中，我們可以舉出兩個頂有名的大商人來：一個是徐公平，一個是葉鐵可。前者以販賣米蔴等爲業，有自備船舶，在各大都市皆設有分店，公司內分設保險，航業，銀行各部；後者則是一個工人出身的華僑，其葉鐵可公司也是以買賣農產品爲主，在馬尼拉有三所大倉庫，其他各地亦設有支倉庫六所，在香港，上海，厦門，鎭江，寗波等地均設有分店，其內部亦設有航運，保險，銀行各部。——於此不僅可以看出徐葉二氏所經營的商業之規模的宏大，而且可以看到華僑在菲律賓的工商業中佔有了如何重要的地位。</p>
<p>菲島華僑對於文化和敎育事業也很努力。在這裏，不僅有華僑自辦的許多日報，而且還有各種刋物；在馬尼拉，由華僑設立的學校很多，而且辦法也很好，所以南洋各地的華僑學校都以此爲模仿對象。</p>
<p>但是，歐戰以後，非島華僑備受美政府的虐待。如輸船公司禁止華人投資，限制米價，强行歐文　記條例，都是在向華僑作無情的進攻；至於最近菲人的高唱「菲律賓人之菲律賓主義」，公開排斥華僑，與夫××人的竭力競爭，更給與了非島華僑以很大的打擊。</p>
<p>荷領東印度</p>
<p>荷領東印度亦名荷屬南洋，在亞洲之東南，澳洲之西北，是結合羣島而成的。在羣島中有五個主要的島：爪哇，馬渡拉，蘇門答臘，波羅洲，西里伯，新其內亞；除這五大島之外還有很多小島。如小巽他羣島，摩羅哥羣島是。總計荷領東印度之全面積，有二百萬平方基　　突，約佔歐洲全部（歐俄除外）之半數。</p>
<p>至於華人之來荷領東印度，其時當與其到南洋各地的時間差不多。不過，華僑之在這里日益發展的則情事是在十七世紀之初荷蘭佔有東印度之後。因爲東印度羣島雖然天然物產很豐富，但其居民乃是原始未開化的民族。愚頑也鬥，不能開發天然的富源。所以，荷人至後，想要開發天然富源，便設法招引勤苦耐勞的華工到該島去。</p>
<p>在香港，汕頭和厦門一帶，荷人曾招雇大批華工，以開拓非礦藏。此種華工名為「契約工人」，即是荷人的奴隸，終身為其工作，任其虐待，以至於死。所以廣東人把荷人招雇的華工呌猪仔。此外，荷蘭人因東印度急需大量勞力來開發礦藏，甚至採取極不正當的手段，掠奪華人至該地工作。</p>
<p>後來，因為東印度的工商業日益發展，華人來此開工廠和經營商業的也很多。所以，直到現在，荷領東印度的華僑竟有一百餘萬之多。</p>
<p>荷領南洋的主要產業爲製糖業，可說全操在荷蘭人和馬來人之手中。華人對此間的各種大企業的投資都較低徵；只是在商業方面華人是佔有極重要的地位的。土人的農產品之輸出，歐美及日本的商品之輸入，都必要經過華人之手。在這里的商業方面能與華人競爭的，可說只有亞拉伯人。</p>
<p>近年來東印度的華僑，也與其他各地的華僑一樣遭到了許多的打擊。最顯然的，如華人在此開設商店及販賣物品均須覓保，呈請當地政府機關批準後方能開始營業。營業後每年又須繳納所得稅，營業稅，衛生稅。家具稅等；如有到期不繳者，卽行加以逮捕。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Upon receiving news from the National Government that President Wang had telegraphed his resignation to Nanjing, the Secretariat immediately forwarded it to Chairman Lin via a special telegram. The Chairman replied directly to President Wang via telegram from Lushan, expressing reassurance and urging him to stay. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Ye Chucang arrived in Qingdao from Nanjing at 7:30 AM on the 10th. Shen Ge and Zeng Zhongming, among others, welcomed him at the station. Ye went to the Guest House to stay and attended a banquet hosted by Shen at noon. In the afternoon, he met with Wang, representing the Central Government to express condolences and inquire about his condition. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a source, Ye Chucang arrived in Qingdao on the morning of the 10th to visit Wang, representing the Central Government in earnestly urging him to stay and encouraging him to return to Nanjing as soon as possible. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding President Wang's resignation, the Central Government has not yet formally discussed it, but the general consensus is to reassure and retain him. It is understood that when Standing Committee member Ye Chucang left Nanjing for Qingdao, Wang's resignation telegram had not yet arrived in Nanjing, so he did not see it. Upon its arrival, Standing Committee member Ju Zheng immediately telegraphed Ye to relay the message and requested Ye to represent the Central Government in consoling Wang. Ye arrived in Qingdao on the morning of the 10th, and it is expected that Wang and Ye will have a sincere discussion on the resignation issue during their meeting. Cai Yuanpei departed from Shanghai for Qingdao on the 10th, bearing the mission of representing the Central Government to retain Wang. It is generally hoped that Ye and Cai can persuade Wang to withdraw his resignation. Ye will not be able to return to Nanjing until Tuesday or Wednesday of next week at the earliest. Around Thursday of next week's Central Standing Committee meeting, if Ye has returned, he will report on his trip and it will be discussed. Furthermore, after the National Government forwarded Wang's resignation telegram to Chairman Lin at Guling, there was still no reply received in Nanjing as of the 10th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) A reporter met with Zeng Zhongming at the career exhibition and inquired about President Wang's condition and the reason for his resignation. According to him, Wang's condition has indeed improved, but as he holds an important position in the government, his frail health makes it difficult for him to handle the responsibilities, so he telegraphed his resignation. However, Wang's determination to resign is firm and has not been dispelled. The reporter also went to the Guest House to visit Ye Chucang, but was unable to see him. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After returning to Nanjing, Jiang Zuobin paid separate visits to He Yingqin, Xu Mo, and Tang Youren, among others. On the morning of the 10th, he went to the Mausoleum to pay respects. Jiang was instructed by Wang's telegram to wait in Nanjing to meet him. Now that Wang has telegraphed his resignation to the Central National Government, it seems unlikely that he will return to Nanjing in the short term. Jiang may go to Qingdao to meet him soon, but according to those around him, he has no immediate plans to go. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Children's Year and Children's Literature <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Children's literature is often called "food for the spirit of children." This is a very appropriate name and the words used are very precise. The so-called "food" includes delicacies and flavors that are not easily accessible to ordinary people, and even if consumed, may not necessarily be nutritious. By using the term "food," we exclude such things and focus specifically on grains. Grains are essential for life, and are indispensable to people of all social classes. To use this as a metaphor for children's literature is even more appropriate. Even if parents do not buy all kinds of reading material for their children, even the most remote rural schools will contain traces of children's literature. Children sing and play outside of school, and inside they unroll books to read and enjoy. Their wisdom is developed and their character is shaped. Children's literature is truly "food" for children, not comparable to candy, fresh oranges, and water.</p>
<p>Children's Year began this month. Publishers are joining this grand event and are publishing advertisements to inexpensively issue children's literature so that children can benefit and improve their spiritual health. This intention is beautiful and commendable. Looking at the catalogs of children's literature from various publishers, there are collections like forests, with hundreds of volumes. Children looking at them can choose what they love and enjoy them greatly. Those who wish for a good future for children can also feel gratified.</p>
<p>However, after careful examination of the substance of the children's literature from various publishers, those who feel gratified will soon feel disappointed. This is because what they find is that this "food" may not be nutritious. The growth of grains depends on the hidden potential of nature, but even with human intervention, there are differences in quality. This so-called "food for the spirit" has its growth independent of other forces, and its quality depends entirely on the diligence of cultivation. Careless cultivation will result in mediocre results. I have often looked at the children's literature from various publishers and summarized several shortcomings: emperors and princesses appear at the drop of a hat; gods, immortals, ghosts, and strange boxes are everywhere. Cunning schemes and deception are falsely called wisdom. Performing a small good deed leads to wealth and nobility. Weakness is seen as a virtue and physical labor is seen as hard work. All of these things are inappropriate for the current era, especially for the children of our nation today. Unfortunately, we often encounter these things in children's literature. This is the fault of impure consciousness. The layout is simple and clumsy, and you can guess the ending from the beginning. The language is empty and vague, and you don't retain any impression even after finishing the volume. Children love activity, like change, and hate empty talk. They want to see real things. Children's literature is not enough to satisfy their wishes, so they turn to other things. The picture books lined up in the streets and alleys, which education experts see as poison, become treasures for children. This is the fault of unskilled technique. The language used either violates logic or deviates from grammar. Sometimes they mix in rural slang that people from other places cannot understand, or they simply believe in imitating sentences that our people are not accustomed to. They casually claim to imitate the tone of children, but in reality children would never speak like that. Children will get used to it over time, and their language and thinking will go astray. Not only will language teaching encounter obstacles, but teaching in other subjects will also be affected. This is the fault of inappropriate language. Their poems are also often objectionable. Often there is no poetic interest and no impression. Their songs for physical exercises say "Get up early, learn exercises, be healthy, have high aspirations." Songs about scenery say "Red flowers bloom, butterflies come, beautiful scenery, truly lovely." Or they pile up admonitory texts like a strict father scolding his son, or they mix in everyday language like a beach song on stage. They seek only to rhyme and do not care about awkward sentences. The meaning is between understandable and incomprehensible, and the flavor is between existing and non-existing. The feelings they give will make children suddenly realize that poetry is such a boring and tedious thing. Even if they never develop an interest in it in their entire lives, there is nothing to regret. Therefore, children's poetry is not only insufficient to cultivate character, but is even a tool to block intelligence. As for their drawings, they are even less collaborative. Often they only have outlines, and they lack any wonderful details. Not to mention anything else, just speaking of the characters, the outlines do not correspond to anatomy, and the expressions are all stiff. The children all look dull, and the workers and farmers all become ruffians. Children love to look at drawings. When a book arrives, this is the first thing they do. If they cannot find good works, they will also enjoy the inferior ones. However, their ability to perceive and depict things is being suppressed. The lack of achievements in drawing education has many reasons, but it is not due to the crudeness of illustrations in children's literature. The above are some of the major issues. If you want to describe them in detail, even 100,000 words may not be enough. I don't mean to be hypercritical, but the facts are as they are. What's the point of covering them up? The world is not lacking in wise parents, good teachers, and enlightened educators. If you ask them about children's literature, they will definitely say that my views are incomplete and my words are not exhaustive.</p>
<p>This raises two questions. Is the spiritual food that is piled up in warehouses just a facade with a completely different quality? Generally speaking, we can be proud of its abundance. Strictly speaking, isn't it almost equal to zero? Now, during Children's Year, the spiritual food of children is almost equal to zero. Those who can feel disappointed will go one step further to think about it. Because this spiritual food, which is just a facade, is displayed around children every day, allowing them to take it and swallow it at any time, how much does it harm the nutrition of children? How much does it hinder the vitality of children? Even if you have clever calculations, you probably can't answer it quickly. Now, during Children's Year, children are swallowing spiritual food of completely different quality to hinder their vitality. Isn't this even more disappointing?</p>
<p>The occurrence and existence of anything cannot be separated from the relationship of time and space. Today, our nation has children's literature that is just a facade with a completely different quality. There are various reasons for this, but writers and publishers take it too lightly and make it too easy. They cannot escape their responsibility. Children's literature is of course a commodity. However, even ordinary commodities must be suitable for the purchaser. Moreover, children's literature is food for the spirit of children. How can it be hastily produced so that "no one recognizes the goods once they leave the door"? It is not easier to teach in a university than to teach in elementary school. You can know that writing children's literature is not easier than writing works that will be passed down for generations. Unfortunately, this basic concept is ignored by writers and publishers. They only seek to produce more and make goods faster, which makes the colorful and dazzling things displayed in the bookshelves are actually the same as nothing. It is even worse to see it as harmful. It is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>It is useless to only sigh and spoil the fun. I hope that writers and publishers will wake up now and establish a basic concept first. Children's literature must be produced with caution. All the above-mentioned shortcomings must be avoided. Don't boast about the fact that you have piles of things from the past. You should examine them one by one with a calm mind. Quickly eliminate the worst ones and retain the better ones. On the one hand, start from scratch and create good works. This is of course not something that can be done in a hurry. In the future, when there are more good works, then even the better ones will be eliminated. Perhaps children will have spiritual food of pure quality, and their character and wisdom can get adequate nutrition. Are the enlightened writers and publishers interested in this? Starting from Children's Year, thoroughly improving children's literature is also a major step for children.</p>

Unexpectedly, about a hundred remnants of the bandit gang attempted to sneak back into the interior on the night of the 8th. Fortunately, the police and militia stationed at Yiyuankou were prepared and launched a fierce counterattack and encirclement. After a fierce battle lasting about two hours, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. Only about thirty people remained and fled into the territory of Rehe. (10th Daily Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Since British reporter Jones was abducted to a certain location in Fengning County, Rehe Province, negotiations between the responsible officials sent by the Chahar Provincial Government and the bandits have stalled due to the inability to cross the border, causing the rescue efforts to come to a standstill. Military Attaché Scator of the British Embassy in Beiping subsequently contacted Military Attaché Takahashi of the Japanese Embassy, who telegraphed Chengde to inquire about the truth. Last night, a reply confirmed that Jones was indeed in Rehe Province. Following the British request, Takahashi telegraphed Chengde that night, requesting an urgent rescue of Jones and escort to Beiping. As of tonight, Takahashi has not yet received a telegram confirming Jones' escape. It is generally believed that Jones will be able to escape from the bandit den within a few days. (10th Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to today's news, there are currently five groups of negotiators approaching the bandits separately, hoping that Jones can be released as soon as possible. Three of these groups were dispatched by the Chahar Provincial Government. Their efforts are expected to yield concrete results soon. According to a Japanese spokesperson, various parties in Rehe are looking for opportunities to rescue Jones and plan to pay the ransom first. The exact amount demanded by the bandits has not been determined, but the latest information indicates it is 90,000 yuan. It is reported that Jones was detained in the area where the Sino-Japanese conflict occurred in mid-January of this year. Although the conflict has been resolved, the border has not been clearly demarcated, which explains why the telegram from Zhangjiakou indicated that Jones was in Chahar Province, while the telegram from Chengde stated that he had entered Rehe Province, causing conflicting information. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It was once rumored that British reporter Jones had been released, but according to a reply telegram from Chengde received by Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Takahashi on the evening of the 9th, Jones was confirmed to be still in Rehe Province. Following the British request, Takahashi telegraphed Chengde that night, requesting an urgent rescue. Since Jones was abducted to Rehe Province, our rescue efforts have been quite difficult, and we are now seeking other methods to vigorously proceed. British Embassy Military Attaché Miller is still staying in Zhangjiakou, working with the Chahar Provincial Government to handle all matters. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Sir Otto Niemeyer, chief economic advisor to the British government, departed today with Mr. Paton of the Treasury and Mr. Rogers, an expert from the Bank of England, aboard the Empress of Britain for China. Before his departure, Sir Otto met with a Reuters reporter, declining to discuss the details of his mission to China. He stated that his primary objective was to investigate the current situation and report back to the government. He added that the government's decision to send him to China reflects the government's concern for China's financial and economic difficulties. The purpose of this trip is to determine whether cooperation with other relevant countries can produce recommendations to help China restore a stable and satisfactory situation, which will benefit China's export trade and foreign trade. He will take a broad view of the situation in the Far East and meet with Chinese authorities. He will, of course, adopt their views as much as possible. Sir Otto also hopes to make contact with important figures in the British business community in Shanghai, stating that he has already met with their representatives in London. Sir Otto denied rumors that he would go to Washington but said that he hopes to meet with several American representatives in Shanghai to cooperate. Sir Otto will spend two days in Toronto visiting relatives when he arrives in Canada and will stay in Tokyo for several days when he passes through Japan to meet with Japanese officials.

<h3 id="e42">Rumors About Sir Otto's Visit to China Are Unreliable; US Silver Purchases Have Decreased Significantly <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, the mission of British financial representative Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to China is solely to investigate China's monetary and economic situation and British investment interests in China. Various rumors that Britain and Japan are planning to divide the Chinese market, or that Sir Otto's visit to China has other missions, such as studying naval issues in preparation for convening a 1936 naval conference, are all inaccurate. Responsible sources also believe that Sir Otto's visit to Japan before going to China is intended to express Britain's hope that Japan will no longer oppose the dispatch of financial representatives to China by various countries. Initially, Britain proposed that representatives from Britain, the United States, France, Japan, or Italy go to Nanjing to hold a Chinese monetary conference, but it was abandoned due to Japan's firm opposition. Later, the method was changed, with each country sending financial representatives to China separately to submit reports to their respective governments, avoiding the form of a conference. Therefore, the British government appointed its chief treasury advisor, Sir Otto Niemeyer, and the French government appointed Mr. Renault-Sios, financial vice-counselor at its embassy in London, to visit China in the near future. However, the American financial representative has not yet been appointed. The mission of the British financial representative is to investigate China's financial situation, especially the monetary situation, to place Chinese currency on a stable foundation, but its importance is not limited to this. Many British investments in railways in China have failed to repay their debts on time. Studying the current situation of these railways is also one of Sir Otto Niemeyer's main missions. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Responsible sources believe that the British government's dispatch of financial representative Sir Otto Niemeyer to China for investigation has two main missions: one is to stabilize China's currency, and the other is to enable the Nanjing government to obtain international loans guaranteed by foreign governments, thereby strengthening the position of the Chinese government. Regarding the first mission, responsible sources believe that the Chinese currency can be linked to the pound sterling. However, setting a fixed exchange rate between the Chinese currency and the pound sterling would not only require excessive funds to protect this exchange rate but would also endanger the gold bloc, making it difficult to achieve. In addition, it seems possible to imitate the Argentine "Peso" method, using the pound sterling as a measure of the rise and fall of the Chinese currency, that is, as the "benchmark" of the Chinese currency. If so, it would be feasible. Financial figures here also believe that only with the economic recovery of China can Chinese railway loans be restored to repay principal and interest. It would be a mistake to lend money to China to repay the arrears owed to Chinese railway loan bondholders. This is why Britain advocates international loans to China for construction expenses. However, these two plans inevitably face various difficulties. One is the opposition of the Japanese government, which Sir Otto will try to overcome by persuading the Japanese government to understand that Britain's plan has no political background and that its purpose is only to improve China's commercial and financial position, from which Japan's trade with China will benefit first and foremost. The second is the difficulty of the monetary problem, which Sir Otto will solve using the above-mentioned method. The third is that if international loans are guaranteed by foreign governments, the parliaments of various countries may not be able to approve them, as most countries are currently suffering from excessive budget burdens and cannot bear this burden. Therefore, the purpose of the relevant governments sending representatives to China separately is to investigate China's current situation and its economic improvement, draft reports, and submit them to their respective governments so that the governments can propose legislation to their parliaments based on the reasons stated in the reports, requesting guarantees for Chinese loans, which would then be more likely to be approved by the parliaments. (10th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today from reliable sources here that the silver purchase plan will make it impossible for the United States to cooperate with Britain in sending a financial mission to China, and even informal consultations are not possible. This is because Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British government's chief economic advisor, is traveling to the Far East from London via Canada and is not going through the United States. On the eve of Sir Otto's departure, officials stated that there was no progress on this matter here. Responsible sources here also said that the US government still adheres to the policy of collective action to help China's economic prosperity, but it must continue to purchase silver based on congressional mandates. This makes it difficult for the United States to cooperate with Sir Otto, as the government fears that joining the cooperation will conflict with the congressional silver purchase law and put it in a difficult position. It is not yet known what attitude the United States will take towards China. For the time being, it will likely remain in a state of aloofness. (9th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today that a total of 3,180,503 yuan worth of silver was imported in the week ending August 2, the lowest number since June 21. The small amount of silver imported has led experts to believe that the United States has stopped buying silver and that silver prices will stabilize. Of the silver imported this time, 2,670,970 yuan came from Mexico, 551,695 yuan came from Canada, and Britain supplied only 31,000 yuan. The imported gold was worth a total of 7,884,950 yuan.

<p>(Washington) The silver imported into the United States in the week ending August 2 decreased significantly compared to the previous week, by approximately 3,079,000 yuan.

It is reported that the British approach to the conference was decided by Prime Minister Baldwin before he left for Aix-les-Bains for vacation on August 7th. However, this decision should not be regarded as a concrete British plan. Eden will return to London tomorrow to discuss certain points with diplomatic experts on Monday.

<p>Bellingzona, Switzerland Although Rome denies reports of Italian soldiers deserting due to fear of the expedition, it is widely believed that a large number of Italian soldiers have escaped into Ticino, the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland, in the past few days. Many of them were ordered to go to Northeast Africa. Italian border guards are now closely monitoring the border to prevent Italian soldiers from continuing to escape into Switzerland. Therefore, deserters have to cross the border into Switzerland through the deserted and uninhabited mountains. Once they arrive in Ticino, it is not difficult for them to blend in, as the residents of the region speak Italian and are mostly sympathetic to the deserters. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters dispatch from the Swiss capital, the Swiss Federal Council attaches great importance to a certain propaganda campaign currently underway in Ticino, advocating the annexation of the region into Italy, and has decided to charge one man and one woman arrested in Bellingzona with high treason and punish them according to law. All employees of Ticino who participate in the propaganda movement will be investigated. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa According to news from here today, if war breaks out, the Ethiopian King will confront the Italian army on the battlefield with seven armies of approximately 660,000 men. 250,000 of these men will be supplied with rifles by the government, while the rest will purchase their own weapons. The armies in the southeast, northwest, and south will be led by their respective princes, while the central army will maintain rear security and prepare to assist wherever needed most urgently. Each of the seven armies has fifty battalions, with each battalion consisting of three thousand men. Ethiopia has approximately 300,000 to 1,000,000 rifles and approximately 200 cannons, but their effectiveness is doubtful, as some of them are up to seventy years old. There are approximately 400 machine guns, and a similar number of quick-firing rifles. There are eight aircraft, but only six are able to take off. The Ethiopian military will adopt guerrilla warfare tactics. Therefore, the military authorities do not value modern weaponry, except for rifles and machine guns. The Ethiopian government is quite concerned about the lack of military supplies in Ethiopia, but hopes that Ethiopian soldiers can compensate for their lack of modern weaponry and organization with their endurance, courage, patriotism, and vitality. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Ethiopian Minister to France, Haile Woldie, stated in an interview published in Quotidien today that "to seek peace, one must be armed" remains an irrefutable truth. Therefore, Ethiopia's purchase of weapons from abroad is a result of circumstances. It is unfair for all countries to prohibit the import of weapons into Ethiopia, as this action only harms Ethiopia, while Italy, which has the ability to manufacture its own weapons, suffers no loss. According to the Ethiopian Minister, people from various countries have come to offer their services to the Ethiopian army in droves, but as the Ethiopian government has not yet issued instructions on this matter, it can only reject them. The Minister also stated that Belgian military instructors have been working in Ethiopia for many years. As for whether other foreign military experts are needed, the government has not yet made any indication of this. Finally, Haile Woldie stated that Ethiopia's trust in the work of the arbitration committee remains unshaken and that it also has admiration for the League of Nations. However, when all else fails, Ethiopians will defend their motherland, with or without weapons. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) British citizens who have volunteered to serve in the Ethiopian army have been rejected by the Ethiopian legation here due to nationality and travel expenses issues. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, the Ethiopian consulate there has received thousands of letters of application to serve in the Ethiopian army, and is still receiving hundreds of letters of application every day. In addition to England and Germany, a large number of military personnel from Poland, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and other countries have volunteered. Even from the Gold Coast, one person is willing to supply 10,000 soldiers to serve Ethiopia, but they have all been politely declined. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The "Paris Echo" correspondent in London discusses the reasons for Germany's conservative silence on the Italo-Ethiopian issue, stating that Germany has not expressed an attitude towards the development of the East African issue, apparently waiting for an opportunity to take action. Well-informed sources know that when former British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden visited Berlin this spring, the German government raised the issue of colonies. In this case, Germany will sooner or later raise demands for colonies. Germany will either demand the redistribution of colonies or demand that the major powers distribute the world's major industrial raw materials so that Germany can also get a piece of the pie. The presentation of this demand is only a matter of time and will ultimately be unavoidable. (Havas, 10th)</p>

According to reliable sources, in 1933, the percentage of exports to Ethiopia from various countries was as follows: French Somaliland 36%, Japan 36.6%, Belgium 10.1%, England 4.8%, India 5.6%, the United States 3.4%, Soviet Russia 2.6%, Italy 2.4%, Egypt 2.3%, France 2.3%, Germany 2%.

<p>(Moscow) The 15th World Physiological Congress opened in Leningrad on the 9th, with 1,500 representatives attending, as well as members and guests of the Soviet government. The opening speech was delivered by researcher Pavlov, followed by congratulatory speeches from government representatives Uglov, Secretary of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Karpinsky, President of the Academy of Sciences, and Kodatsky, Chairman of the Leningrad Soviet. In his speech, Pavlov emphasized the importance of the congress for educating new scientists and said that the Soviet government is very concerned about scientific work and young people who love science, and has allocated huge sums of money to assist them. Pavlov mentioned the war crisis, saying that it is a "cruel way to solve life's difficulties," and said, "Our powerful motherland is fighting for peace and never covets an inch of other people's land, which is very gratifying." At that time, the audience cheered loudly. Pavlov finally expressed his gratitude to the Soviet government for its assistance in the success of the congress. Subsequently, Ukolov, on behalf of the Soviet government, said that it was very gratifying that the congress could be held in the Soviet Union, because in the Soviet Union, physiology is progressing rapidly because the government pays close attention to scientific work, and the number of physiologists is in the thousands, no longer calculated by individuals. Amidst applause, Ukolov went on to recount Pavlov's great contributions to the development of Soviet physiology, and how the government and people admire Pavlov's work. "The Soviet working masses, with the help of scientific power, have completely transformed an illiterate country. Today, 500,000 young people in the Soviet Union are studying at universities, and there are more than 1,000 scientific research institutes and 41,000 scientific workers. The Soviet Union has become an advanced industrial country, with electrical stations all over the country. Its metal industry and machinery manufacturing production already account for the first place in Europe and the second place in the world. Its agricultural mechanization is the most extensive in the world. This great work is the realization of the immortal teachings of our mentor Lenin, and all of it is carried out under the leadership of his outstanding disciple Stalin." At that time, there was a loud burst of applause, lasting for quite some time. "All the victories of our country's science and technology are in raising the cultural level of the masses and maintaining international peace," Ukolov concluded, "The Soviet government hopes that this congress of the world's largest scientists will promote the development of physiology and benefit the working masses." Finally, Ukolov wished the representatives of the congress success in their work. After congratulatory speeches by Karpinsky and Kodatsky, Chairman of the Leningrad Soviet, the congress listened to a report by Professor Cannon, the American representative. The congress elected Pavlov, Professor Lapicque (France), and Hill (England) as members of the presidium. (TASS, 10th)</p>

<p>(Paris) At 3:30 PM today, the governors of all provinces were summoned by Prime Minister Laval to hold a meeting here. The Prime Minister gave detailed instructions on the implementation of the government's decrees, especially those on reducing the cost of living. It is reported that this is the first time that a meeting of national provincial governors has been convened since the establishment of the Third Republic. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, the Council of Ministers drafted a second batch of decrees, mainly aimed at undertaking public works to revive the economy, reducing the cost of living to equalize the people's burden, and stipulating measures to abolish import quotas for certain goods, including socks and other manufactured goods.

<p>(Paris) In the past few days, there have been strikes in Brest, Toulon, and Le Havre to protest against the 10% wage cut. Today, all three places passed quietly. Strikers in Toulon had a fierce fight with the police yesterday. Countless shop windows were smashed, resulting in two deaths and three injuries. Forty-four people were arrested. The shops are still closed, proving the severity of the riots. After the Champoillon set sail, the Columbia continued to raise anchor and set sail for the Baltic Sea. The Lafayette also set sail for Canada with 320 French veterans. The governors of all departments are now gathered in Paris to listen to Prime Minister Laval explain the new economic laws aimed at protecting the franc and restoring the country's economy. This is truly an unprecedented event in the history of the Third Republic of France, but two prefects, due to strikes in Toulon and Brest, were unable to be present. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Order has been restored in all French seaports today. Workers in the ports of Brest and Toulon have also gone to work in local shipyards and arsenals. Officials are closely examining the background of the revolutionary activities. The same is true for those arrested in the port of Toulon. Armed soldiers still guard the stations. Many people who have observed the scene of the incident are convinced that these disturbances cannot be regarded as a political demonstration. Socialist and Communist newspapers have condemned the right wing for inciting the riots, believing that the government has laid the groundwork for blatant intervention. Left-wing political groups have organized several committees to investigate the cause of the disturbances. Trade unions have also asked workers to maintain peace and return to work. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It has been learned here that the anti-government demonstrations and riots in various French seaports were planned by the Communist Party. This has been verified. Two Communist Party instructors immediately departed for the Communist Party branch in Brest after the outbreak of the riots to give final instructions. It is claimed that of the 85 people arrested in the Toulon riots, only 12 are over 20 years old. One of the 36 people currently detained has been confirmed to be a grammar school teacher.

<p>(London) The current British Parliament was elected in 1931 and is now scheduled to hold a general election in October. Various political parties are now engaged in large-scale activities to prepare for the election. The number of candidates who have been nominated is 1,473, including 490 belonging to the government party, 50 belonging to the Simon-led Liberal Party, and 28 belonging to the National Labour Party. The number of candidates belonging to the opposition party is 505 belonging to the Labour Party and 400 belonging to the Samuel-led Liberal Party. This number of candidates is not yet fixed, as the total number of candidates will increase, while the number of candidates from the Samuel-led Liberal Party may decrease. In addition, former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George may put forward candidates under the banner of a revival platform, but it is currently uncertain. As for the Conservative Party, it intends to find ways to increase the number of candidates from the Simon-led Liberal Party and the National Labour Party, and to have some Conservative candidates give up their candidacies so that the National Cabinet can win. Recently, Conservative Party leader Prime Minister Baldwin issued a declaration reaffirming the banner of the National Cabinet and asking voters to trust it. It can be seen that the Conservative Party does not intend to campaign alone, but wants to unite with the National Labour Party and the Simon-led Liberal Party to fight against the opposition party.

<p>(New York) 15,000 skilled workers today refused to work for the government's work relief plan, which may halt the project and leave another 105,000 workers unemployed. Green, the president of the American Federation of Labor, said that similar strikes may occur in Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Seattle. It is generally believed that this move will make the situation take a sharp turn for the worse. Whether union workers can force the government to pay union workers the wages they deserve can be determined by this move. Federal Relief Commissioner Hopkins criticized the matter in Washington, saying that work relief workers will never go on strike. If they do not want to work, they can go elsewhere. At the same time, New York Work Relief Commissioner General Johnson warned striking workers not to brew riots, but the striking workers paid no attention to it. New York General Federation of Labor Chairman Mounet sent a flight group to encourage non-union workers to join the strike, further complicating the situation. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Social Security Act, which the government submitted to Congress earlier, was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives in June, and then amended by a joint conference of the two houses. The Senate today passed the amended version of the bill. The bill provides for unemployment insurance and worker pension systems, and is the most important bill in the Congressional agenda. Its purpose is to enable the American people to rely on pensions paid by the federal and state governments, as well as national unemployment insurance and pension systems, without having to suffer the pain of unemployment, poverty, or old age. It is expected that President Roosevelt will sign it into law. The cost of this bill is approximately US$3 billion, of which only one-tenth is raised through taxation, and the rest is contributed by employers and employees each year. The fund for this contribution increases year by year, and it is estimated that the total amount will reach US$50 billion in 1980. At that time, men and women over the age of 65 will receive a government subsidy of up to US$85 per month in pensions. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Unprecedented Tianmen Flood Disaster</p>
<p>A small boat rowed out from Huangjia Bridge in the early morning, winding its way through the drainage ditches of Longshu. Every time it passed a house, the boatman would call out to ask if anyone was going to the city. Those who responded boarded, totaling twelve people. It was said that because everyone nearby lived on higher ground, boats were scarce, so they had to call out to make arrangements. After about two miles, they arrived at Wujia Changwan. They abandoned the boat and waded through the mud. The villagers who had not been drowned or displaced were engaged in repairing houses and removing mud, but their movements were slow and they lacked energy. It was clear that without repairs, the situation would be untenable, yet the repairs seemed utterly pointless. According to them, there were more than sixty households in the village. When the flood came, everyone climbed onto the roofs and went hungry for three days and nights before the water receded enough for them to come down. Chickens, dogs, pigs, and cattle had all drowned, their bloated corpses emitting a foul stench. The situation was extremely tragic. At that time, the sound of weeping filled the city, and there were occasional gunshots. It was initially thought that the security team was shooting at water monsters, but it later turned out they were intimidating and forcing the people to hand over their boats for their own use.</p>
<p>Leaving the village, they waded through accumulated water, which was knee-deep. There were branches that tripped them up. Near the edge, they saw soybeans, but only the stalks remained, without any leaves. A woman stood far away, shouting angrily, saying, "After the flood, you shouldn't trample on my soybean field again. I'm afraid it will be impossible to find even a bit of firewood." Approaching the woman, they saw she was holding a naked infant with a swollen belly and skeletal frame, which was very pitiful. Crossing the Tianmen County River, they arrived at the street along the city moat. Looking up at the mud deposited on the rooftops, they knew that the water level had receded about fifteen feet. However, the Xiang River embankment had collapsed without being blocked, and the flow of the county river was still very strong. The water levels of the 民十 and 民二十 were very high, but neither reached the street along the embankment. This year, however, the water rose three feet above the street along the embankment, five feet higher than the highest water level of 民十. The severity of the disaster can be imagined. The street along the embankment was a gathering place for hundreds of merchants, and the essence of Tianmen. Shops stood side by side, and the offices of government officials were not completely free of water. They were temporarily using a drugstore on the street along the embankment as an office. They then visited Commissioner and County Magistrate Shi Youping, who informed them of the general situation of the Tianmen flood as follows:</p>
<p>Tianmen has low-lying terrain, and the Xiang River and County River run through it. The people depend on the embankments for their lives. On July 7th, the Xiang River embankment in the Zhongxiang County area breached in three or four sections. From its high position, the area along the County River was the first to be impacted and was completely submerged. Unfortunately, the Shuanghe area in the fourth district of the county also suffered a breach, and seventy-two villages were turned into a watery expanse. The water rose exceptionally rapidly, rising more than nineteen feet in a day and night. The extent of the disaster was unprecedented. After the breach in Zhongxiang on the 7th, Tianmen heard the news on the 8th and telegraphed the county magistrates of Zhongxiang and Jingshan, but received no response because the telegraph poles had been destroyed, resulting in a disruption of communication. Shi immediately led engineer Liu Shengheng and others to Yuekou to supervise the protection. Fortunately, the stationed troops joined the rescue efforts, and no accidents occurred. However, the floodwaters reached Tianmen at about 1 p.m., steadily rising until 8 a.m. on the 9th, when they suddenly overflowed the embankment and breached it. More than a dozen members of the rescue security team and laborers were washed away. The western section of the moat embankment overflowed and breached in thirteen places, both large and small. About three hundred families in the Ximen area were severely affected. Except for the north and south city gate towers and the top of the ancient city embankment outside the north gate, there was no dry land left in the entire city. By evening, the entire city was submerged, filled with cries for help. In addition, the wind and waves roared, and the mountains seemed to shake. The human world and the realm of ghosts were almost indistinguishable.</p>
<p>It was found that the breached area was more than twenty feet higher than Tianmen County (calculated according to the Wusong Datum), so when the water reached Tianmen, it rushed and poured down, causing the most severe damage. Furthermore, the area below Tianmen, including Hanchuan and Hanyang, is even lower than Tianmen. Therefore, although the water level has now receded, Hanchuan and Hanyang are still submerged. In total, in Tianmen County, except for the third, sixth, and seventh districts, which are on higher ground and were not flooded, all other areas are a vast expanse of water. The disaster area is approximately 6,300 li, accounting for seven-eighths of the entire county. The affected population is approximately 124,000 households, or 643,000 people, accounting for eight-tenths of the entire county's population. Approximately 1.4 million mu of farmland were flooded, accounting for eight-tenths of the county's farmland. The loss of housing, crops, clothing, livestock, etc., is no less than 25 million yuan. The number of people drowned is approximately 12,000. Public losses, such as telephone lines, county roads, district roads, and public buildings such as government offices, Confucian temples, various agencies, schools, newly built碉樓, newly built city walls, etc., are estimated to be no less than 300,000 yuan. This spring, in order to improve the rural economy and production, 83,000 mulberry seedlings were requested from the Economic Commission, and they had grown more than a foot tall. Three thousand two hundred dan of selected cotton seeds were requested from the Provincial Construction Department, and they had been planted and were blooming. Now, all of this has been lost.</p>
<p>Relief measures include: (1) providing work as relief, urgently repairing the breached areas to prevent the cities of Tianmen and Hanyang from continuing to be threatened by floods; (2) providing loans for seeds and draught cattle to allow people to take advantage of the receding waters to plant crops; (3) the more than ten breaches in the moat embankment should be repaired immediately, estimated to require 59,000 yuan in labor relief costs (excluding items 1 and 2). All expenses depend on donations from all parties. Currently, the province has provided 13,000 yuan in relief funds and慰勞金, 1,300 bags of flour, and 1,225 packages of broad beans, which is a drop in the bucket and difficult to meet the needs. It is hoped that there will be a continuous flow of aid so that life can gradually return to normal.</p>
<p>After the reporter took his leave, he entered the city to inspect the situation. Shi sent his adjutant, Kuang Jichu, as a guide. The county seat is located on low-lying land, so a moat embankment about thirty-two li long was built to prevent floods. The county river flows around its southwest, east and north sides for about twenty-four li. Therefore, the lives and property of the entire city depended on the protection of the moat embankment. This time, the moat embankment itself went bankrupt, with more than thirty breaches of varying sizes, causing the entire city to be turned into a watery expanse and creating an unprecedented disaster. Walking west along the street along the embankment to Yishuiguan Zhoujia Lane, the floodwaters overflowed the embankment and poured into the lane, scouring it into a pit several dozen feet deep. Houses collapsed, and people were killed and injured, as if a huge bomb had been dropped by an airplane. Xidi Xia Street and Zhong Street also had breaches, with similar situations, but the devastation was even more severe.</p>
<p>Taking a boat into the city, they first passed the Xita Temple. The temple was built in the Jin Dynasty and had a long history, but now it has been completely destroyed, with only three old trees remaining. Arriving at the city wall, the water was still blocking the east, north, and west gate arches. The boat entered through a breach in the west city wall. They saw the Central Primary School (with twelve classes, well-run) and the Land Survey Office, with water levels reaching the doors and windows. The old and dilapidated houses of the common people were even more severely damaged. Entering the Commissioner's Office, a woman was paddling a door in the front yard. The offices, reception rooms, and flower gardens were on higher ground, and the receding water had left a foot of mud, making cleaning difficult. Leaving through the back door, they climbed the north city gate tower. Thirty-four male and female prisoners were being held there. Eighty prisoners were also being held in the south city gate tower. They had all been moved from the prison during the flood. The towers were small and crowded, and sitting and standing were already difficult. Sleeping at night must be even more cramped. Being confined in such a way in the hot weather was very pitiful. The guards were from the Sixteenth Company, and the captain, Zhao Pi, was known for maintaining military discipline, so his reputation was still good. The north and south main streets inside the city were visible, but the outside north was still a vast flood.</p>
<p>Taking the original boat from under the north city gate, they circled the west gate. Waves lapped against the gate arch, making a soft sound. There were many grass sheds on the city wall. Refugees were washing clothes and drawing water by the city, as if living by the embankment. More than a hundred civilian houses were destroyed in the Ximen area, with no tiles or bricks visible. However, when the water receded on the thirteenth and fourteenth, many corpses were hanging from the trees. Walking into the city from the south gate, some shops on South Main Street had opened, but the western part was still gloomy like hell. Because many people were crushed by collapsed houses, there was a foul stench, and they dared not go near to inquire.</p>
<p>The Terrible Situation of Tianmen Being Flooded</p>
<p>Returning to say goodbye to Commissioner Shi, he insisted on keeping them for a meal. During the meal, they learned that Shi had drafted a management plan for the Xiang River flood, which stated, "The Xiang River contains a large amount of sediment, which easily silts up the riverbed, making it futile to increase the height of the embankment. Prevention is impossible, and dredging the Xiang River, which has a sandy bottom, is also difficult. Large-scale reservoirs should be built in the mountainous areas of Shaanxi Province, and the water levels should be reported to the middle and lower reaches at any time. In the middle reaches, measures should be taken to maintain the riverbanks, and in the lower reaches, more tributaries should be opened to divert the water flow. In this way, flood prevention can be effective." Building reservoirs in the upper reaches and reporting water levels are fundamental plans, and the authorities in charge of water conservancy must already be considering them.</p>
<p>In addition, there are three other things related to the Tianmen disaster that should be mentioned. First, when the floodwaters came ashore and destroyed the homes of more than thirty residents on Lower Embankment Street, Yang Dazhen, the father of 保長 Yang Lunji, seeing the dangerous situation, urgently hired two boats at a high price to load his family and neighbors Zheng Yongsheng, Shen Yixing, Zhang Yunqing, and the two families of Chen Yongxing, totaling thirty men and women, and carried their clothes, chests, money, and other items. They stopped behind Shen Yixing's back door. Unexpectedly, five soldiers from the Fifteenth Company of the Security Team (including one pockmarked messenger carrying a box cannon) came and demanded one of the boats. If they refused, they would open fire. Yang Dazhen and others obeyed and crowded into one boat, which was rocking and about to sink. They called for help from another boat. The clothes and chests of money that had been handed over to the previous boat were not taken out. The soldiers forced the boat to leave quickly, and the boat crowded with Yang Dazhen and others capsized into the water, drowning more than twenty people. In addition, several cases of extorting money during the rescue occurred. Fortunately, Commissioner Shi returned from Yuekou early, and the security situation was turned from danger to safety. Regarding the tragic case of奪船 drowning people, it was reported that the family members of the deceased, Yang Lunji, knelt and "攔馬喊寃" when the commissioner inspected the embankment. The commissioner was moved and punished the offenders.</p>
<p>Second, in Xinhe, a township in the western part of Tianmen, there was a female hero, Wang Li, who, when the floodwaters suddenly arrived and people climbed onto the roofs, crying and in a desperate situation, Wang Li was able to bravely disregard her own safety and row back and forth, rescuing more than two hundred disaster victims without accepting a penny. Recently, Li Shucheng, the head of the provincial inspection team, heard about this and deeply admired her, and especially represented the provincial government to award Wang Li forty yuan. In addition, there was also a boatman, Yang Gou, who automatically rescued hundreds of people and was also awarded twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Third, there is an organization called "Tea Party" that uses the name of providing tea and doing charitable work to solicit donations and public virtue, and uses various retributional superstitions such as "heaven collapsing and earth cracking" and "red rain flood" to scare people into joining the association. Those who are superstitious, in addition to donating money and gifts, are even forced by the gods to sell their property to fill the association's funds. It is said that in this way, when a great disaster occurs, they can ride a new broom to heaven, or fly with new shoes, or hold knives and spears, close their eyes, and kill randomly to the north, and the Bodhisattva will come to save them. The association was founded in 1927 or 1928, and no one paid attention to it at first. Its followers spread throughout Tianmen, Jingshan, and Mianyang counties. The original intention was to borrow the gods to collect money, but recently their actions have shown a trend towards becoming the Yellow Turban Rebels, the White Lotus Sect, or the Boxers. The Security Headquarters arrested several leaders, and the remaining followers were still planning to come to the city to rob the prison when the flood inundated the city. Fortunately, the defenses were strong, and the future can be assured of safety.</p>

<p>Tracing Stolen Goods</p>
<p>The robbery case of Jiang Sigen and others in Caoking Xihuo Tangxiang has been investigated by the Ninth Sub-Precinct of that area. It has been discovered that villagers Yao Aba and Sun Yuanqing are suspected of being involved and have left the area together. It was later learned that Sun Yuanqing was hiding in the home of his father-in-law, Lu Zimin. The sub-precinct went to Lu's residence to search without making any noise. Sun Yuanqing had already escaped after hearing the news. Two chests were found upstairs, containing more than ten silk garments, which were not items used by farming families. Lu Zimin confessed that they were brought by his son-in-law, Sun Yuanqing. The sub-precinct then sent Lu Zimin and the stolen goods to the County Public Security Bureau for review and handling.</p>
<p>Public Official Fined for Visiting Prostitute</p>
<p>Zhang Youlan, a staff member of the Land Bureau from Jiangyin, is in his sixties and has a penchant for womanizing. Yesterday evening at about 11 p.m., he and two laborers went to the Jiaotong Inn on Changqiao Street after drinking in the western outskirts and hired a prostitute named Chen Xiubao in room number four. They were caught by inspectors from the Second Sub-Precinct, who considered it detrimental to public morals and took them to the bureau for questioning and fined them five yuan. It is said that someone with influence later bailed him out.</p>

<p>Lake Bandits Attempt to Rob Zhouxiang Town</p>
<p>At 8:30 p.m. on the 9th, several dozen lake bandits were discovered in the Sanchongwan area near the Wusong River in the Sixth District. They were armed with guns and were on eight bandit boats of various sizes, planning to rob Zhouxiang Town. The local villagers noticed and urgently reported to Wang Dasan, the chief of the Third Branch of the Zhangpu Town Public Security Bureau, and Xu Mengzeng, the leader of the First Squad of the Ninth Provincial Security Team stationed in Daci Town. They immediately led the police force to suppress and capture the bandits. By the time they arrived, the bandits had not yet landed. The police force immediately opened fire. Seeing that they were prepared, the bandits resisted slightly and jumped onto their boats, retreating into the Wusong River. The police force bravely pursued them, sinking six bandit boats and capturing six lake bandits, who were taken to the Third Branch for detention.</p>
<p>Private Trafficking of Opium Sentenced to Ten Years</p>
<p>Zhang Da, the head of the Anti-Smoking Investigation Section of the County Public Security Bureau, has spared no effort in investigating and suppressing private opium. Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., Zhang learned that Zhang Zaili in the Baziqiao area outside the North Gate was specializing in selling opium. He immediately ordered Fang Zheng, the head of the investigation team, to lead detectives to arrest Zhang. Thirty liang of Guo Yuanmao brand opium were found and taken to the County Anti-Smoking Committee. After questioning by the committee, it was confirmed that Zhang Zaili was indeed selling opium and was sentenced to ten years in prison as a warning.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Rising River Water Endangers Dike</p>
<p>Recently, there have been storms and rain here, coupled with the overflowing of the river tide. The autumn flood is particularly large, resulting in a 550-meter-long section of the dike along the Xu Liu Jing River in this county being found to be extremely dangerous by the patrol officer, requiring urgent repairs. The estimated cost is 18,000 yuan. The county government has reported this and initially allocated 2,000 yuan from the water conservancy fund to cover the cost. The remaining amount has been submitted to the province for review. An order has been received to first repair the most dangerous 130-odd zhang. The county has purchased 麻袋, wooden stakes, and stones and transported them to Xu Liu Jing for repairs.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Robbery Occurs at Lumberyard in Bustling City</p>
<p>At 0:30 p.m. yesterday (the 10th), two villagers and a carpenter arrived at the Shen Fengyu lumberyard in Pengxia Street outside Ximen to purchase two sets of coffin lumber. Wan Youkun, the manager of the lumberyard, and his partners Rong Kuifu greeted them. The price was agreed upon as 70 yuan. The villagers took out 55 yuan in paper money and 15 yuan in silver and handed it over to manager Wan Youkun to put in the drawer of the accounting table. However, a thief saw this and was tempted. He sneaked into the counter, grabbed the 70 yuan, and ran straight out. Fortunately, partner Rong Kuifu saw this and shouted, "Robbery!" He immediately led the crowd to chase after the thief. Seeing that the situation was not good, the thief threw all the money down and fled. Rong and the others saw that the thief had escaped and the money had been recovered, so they returned to the shop. The manager reported the information to the Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Drug Ring Fugitive Xiao Junfa Arrested</p>
<p>The Supervision Department of the Public Security Bureau of this county received a secret report a few days ago that Xiao Junfa (also known as Xiao Wuxi), a shareholder of drug king Wang Guiqing, had fled to Tianjin and Shanghai after Wang Guiqing's case was exposed. Now, hearing that the situation had calmed down, he had secretly returned to Wuxi and was hiding in the home of his concubine Chen Yueying at No. 14 Wang Lane, Guqiao. They requested an investigation. Chief Inspector Wang received the report and immediately dispatched inspector Ge Xinde to lead police officers to search. They arrested Xiao and found one and a half快上快 pills, 26 empty paper bags, 332 yuan in paper money, and an empty 太古 sugar tin box. They took him to the bureau for strict questioning. Xiao Junfa confessed that in February 1933, he and Wang Guiqing, Zheng Deliang, Su Guoliang (also known as Su Lanbao), and others each contributed more than 3,000 yuan to manufacture small gray Guo Fusheng毒嬌. After Wang Guiqing and the others' cases were exposed, he fled to Tianjin. Today, he returned to Wuxi to visit his concubine and was unfortunately arrested. He was transferred to the county government yesterday (the 10th) for investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Preventing Flooding from the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The Nantong riverbank has been collapsing rapidly recently, with many breaches along the riverbank, creating a dangerous situation. With the autumn floods approaching, the tide is overflowing, causing significant impact. Representatives from all sectors have urgently decided that in addition to the Construction Bureau preparing for prevention, they will immediately send a telegram to the provincial government, forwarding it to the central government and the flood prevention committee, and the Yangtze River Commission to send personnel to investigate. Chen Baochu has been appointed as a representative to petition the province and the central government separately.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Dike on North Bank of Yangtze River in Critical Condition</p>
<p>The easterly wind has been blowing strongly for days, and the river tide has suddenly risen, causing many dangerous sections along the north bank of the Yangtze River, such as the dikes in the Second District of this county from Longwang Temple east to Doutian Temple, to be repeatedly and violently scoured by the wind and waves. County Magistrate Ma Zhenbang and Director of the Construction Bureau Shu Guohua have been paying special attention to the riverside dike project due to the unusually strong wind. They have sent technician Zhang Hanqing to purchase materials and summon farmers from the villages where the dikes are located to carry out night-time repairs. However, one section of the old bank of Gongliuwei, 478 meters long from east to west, was finally completed after several attempts at prevention. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 8th, about 221 meters of the eastern section of the 圩 suddenly collapsed, and dozens of mu of farmland and several houses were washed away. Fortunately, it was during the day, and no one was injured. Currently, the remaining western section and the small堤 along the north and south banks are 330 meters long. Dozens of leaks have been found at the bottom of the western bank, which is 249 meters long, and the situation is critical. The farmers are being urged to do everything they can to repair the dikes. However, the wind and waves are becoming increasingly dangerous, and it is difficult to predict whether the situation can be resolved without problems. However, there is a large堤 in the 圩, about five or six meters wide, which is the dike body newly built in 1932. It is uncertain whether it can withstand the river tide. According to technician Zhang, in addition to doing everything possible to repair the missing sections, the currently un-collapsed but dangerous western section is being defended and guarded by gathering laborers to work overnight. Precautions are also being taken for the inner large堤, and they can only do their best and wait for the weather to improve. Today (the 10th), technician Zhang has submitted a report on the repairs to the Construction Bureau, which will be forwarded to the county government.</p>

<h3 id="e85">German-Austrian-Swiss Returned Students Association Hosts Farewell Tea for Ambassador Cheng at the International Hotel Yesterday <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Our country's first ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, upon receiving his orders, is scheduled to depart for his post within days. The Shanghai German-Austrian-Swiss Returned Students Association and the Tongji University Alumni Association, in particular, held a tea party at the International Hotel on Park Road yesterday afternoon at four o'clock to bid him farewell. Those in attendance included Ambassador Cheng and the embassy secretary Chen Zehua, German Consul General Bai Rende, German Chamber of Commerce President Bo Ersun, General Manager Fu Kaier, German Engineers Association President Tie Meng, German Overseas Chinese Association President Wei De, Manfulanfu China College Friendship Association Quan Congde, Far East Society Grande, and over fifty others. Chairman Weng Zilong gave a farewell speech, followed by a reply from Ambassador Cheng. Both speeches were translated into German by Shen Yi. The text of the two speeches is recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>During the session, Chairman Weng Zilong delivered a farewell speech, which briefly stated: "Today, the German-Austrian-Swiss Returned Students Association and the Tongji University Alumni Association in Shanghai are holding a grand farewell reception to bid farewell to Mr. Cheng Tianfang, our country's first ambassador to Germany. We are honored to have Mr. Cheng grace us with his presence, and also to have Chinese and German guests participate. Mr. Cheng is someone we have always admired. He is a leader of China's cultural movement and a leader in academic and educational circles. It is a great pleasure for us to be able to witness Mr. Cheng's brilliance at this farewell gathering. During the May Fourth Movement, Mr. Cheng led the movement in Shanghai and later studied in the United States and worked for the overseas party headquarters. After returning to China, he held important positions in the central government. In recent years, he has served in political positions in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces and presided over National Zhejiang University and the Central Political School, making many contributions to the country and society. Now that Mr. Cheng is appointed as our country's first ambassador to Germany, he will certainly be fully competent, which is beyond doubt. The cultures of various countries are different, but each has its own unique points. In recent years, Germans have conducted a lot of research on Chinese academic studies, and the number of Chinese people going to Germany to study science is also increasing daily. From this perspective, the communication of Chinese and German cultures is very important. With Mr. Cheng's past contributions to culture, the communication of Chinese and German cultures will certainly have greater development in the future, which is beyond doubt. We know that the special spirit of our Chinese nation is 'loving peace and emphasizing trustworthiness,' and the special spirit of the German nation is 'burying oneself in hard work and striving for construction.' We hope that Mr. Cheng can bring our spirit of emphasizing trustworthiness and loving peace to Germany and spread it throughout Europe to maintain lasting international peace. At the same time, we hope that he can bring back the German spirit of burying oneself in hard work and striving for construction as a good example for our construction of a new China."</p>
<p>Ambassador Cheng's Reply</p>
<p>After Chairman Weng Zilong finished his speech, Ambassador Cheng stood up and replied, briefly stating: "I am honored and ashamed to be invited to this gathering hosted by the Shanghai German-Austrian-Swiss Returned Students Association and the Tongji University Alumni Association. This time, the central government has appointed me as the ambassador to Germany. I am deeply aware that my talent and ability are insufficient and that I have failed to live up to the trust of the central government. The Chinese people, influenced by the thoughts of the ancient sages, have always regarded peace as the main purpose in dealing with foreign countries. China's current foreign policy, I dare to say, is to maintain friendship with all friendly countries in the world. However, the relationship between China and Germany is particularly different, precisely because the two countries have recently shared a similar history. The oppression and economic panic suffered by the Germans after the European War were no less than our current situation. In my opinion, the difficulties Germany faced at that time may have been even greater than China's current situation. Therefore, many people were worried about Germany and did not know what the outcome would be. However, because of the hard work and struggle of the German government and people, they were able to turn danger into safety and emerge from a difficult environment onto a bright path. All undertakings are thriving and admired by people all over the world. China has also recently encountered an extremely difficult environment, and the Chinese government and people are also working hard and striving to implement national recovery measures. Therefore, we see the achievements of Germany's struggle and increase our infinite courage. German friends, seeing the facts of our efforts, will certainly express infinite sympathy. Because of this reason, although China and Germany are of different races and cultures, their relationship is naturally particularly close. After the mutual dispatch of ambassadors this time, the relationship between the two countries will definitely become closer. I am also willing to do my best to promote this aspect. I will be leaving the country soon, and I hope you will continue to give me guidance in the future. I wish you all good health and the Sino-German cultural cause a bright future."</p>
<h3 id="e86">Cai and Ye Go to Qingdao to Persuade President Wang to Stay on Behalf of the Central Government; Cai Will Stay in Qingdao for Two Weeks and Return South at the Beginning of Next Month; Ye Received a Telegram from the Central Government Only After Leaving Beijing <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Central Committee member Cai Yuanpei took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiheng轮 steamer to Qingdao yesterday morning to persuade President Wang to stay on behalf of the Central Government. It is expected that he will arrive on the evening of the 11th. In addition, Central Committee member Ye Chucang also left Beijing for Qingdao at 7:00 p.m. on the 8th to express condolences for Wang's illness. After his departure, a telegram from Wang resigning his position arrived in Beijing. The Central Government then handed the original telegram to the telegraph bureau to be sent, searching for Ye along the way and instructing him to sincerely persuade Wang to stay. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Cai Took the Haiheng Steamer to Qingdao Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Central Committee member Cai Yuanpei, accompanied by his wife and one son and one daughter, took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiheng Steamer from Shanghai to Qingdao at 9:00 a.m. on the 10th. It is expected that he will arrive on the evening of the 11th. Before his departure, Cai met with reporters from various newspapers on board. According to him, his trip to Qingdao was a pre-arranged plan. He had originally planned to depart on the 27th of last month, but he postponed it to the 3rd of this month because he had not purchased a ticket. He also intended to take Taikoo's Shengjing Steamer, but it was temporarily cancelled because the tickets were sold out. Therefore, he was only able to make the trip today. This trip to Qingdao is for sightseeing, and he plans to stay in Qingdao for two weeks and return south at the beginning of next month because the first council meeting of the Academia Sinica is scheduled to be held in Beijing on September 7th, and he must rush back to attend. After learning that President Wang had submitted his resignation, the Central Government entrusted a friend who came to Shanghai from Beijing to convey the instruction to persuade Wang to stay. He thought that President Wang would be able to prioritize the party and the country and dismiss his intention to resign. If his health has not yet recovered, the Central Government can give him a considerable period of leave to recuperate. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is scheduled to be held in Beijing on September 20th, and the notice was issued on the 7th. The meeting will last about a week. The date of the Fifth National Congress will be proposed for discussion at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. As for the pre-determined date of November 12th for the meeting to be held in Beijing, it is not a fixed date and must be submitted to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee for approval before it can be determined.</p>
<p>Ye Had Not Yet Learned of It Before Leaving Beijing</p>
<p>Central Committee member Ye Chucang took the Jinpu train from Pukou to Jinan to Qingdao at 7:15 p.m. on the 8th. At that time, the telegram from President Wang resigning his position had not yet arrived in Beijing. Ye only carried the order to express condolences for his illness. After the telegram of Wang's resignation arrived in Beijing late at night on the 8th, the Central Government immediately handed the original telegram to the telegraph bureau to be sent, searching for Ye along the way and instructing him to sincerely persuade Wang to stay. It is thought that Wang's intention to resign may be dismissed after the Central Government's sincere persuasion.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Industrial and Commercial Loan Association Suggests Flexible Guarantee Methods; Credit Loan Shop Guarantees Changed to One; Two Cases Each Borrowing 200 Yuan Have Been Approved <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee held its seventh meeting recently and approved two small credit loan cases. The remaining 18 cases were rejected or notified to change the guarantee due to non-compliance with the procedures. Eleven cases are still under investigation. The association, considering that it is practically difficult for various factories and shops to find two shop guarantees, decided to suggest to the Ministry of Finance to change it to one. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Committee Approved Two Loan Cases</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 9th), the seventh meeting was held at the National Goods Bank. The committee members present were Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Song Ziliang, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Bei Songsun, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Peishen (replaced by Bei Songsun), Xi Demao, and Du Yuesheng (replaced by Wang Xiaolai), totaling ten people. In addition to the chairman Cai Zengji reporting on the daily affairs of the association, four loan applications that had been investigated and reviewed were submitted for discussion. It was decided that Guangming Battery Industrial Cooperative and Yongtai Candy Store would each be approved to borrow 200 yuan. Zhou Fuji Embroidery Store's request to borrow 5,000 yuan was approved to be reviewed again after changing to a proper guarantee. Senji Paper Mill's request to borrow 5,000 yuan was rejected because the guarantor was found to be ineligible. It is reported that the association had received a total of 21 applications for a total of 53,930 yuan as of the 9th. Among them, 16 cases were rejected because they did not comply with the principles of lending and the detailed rules of lending (such as not operating national goods and falsely filling out forms, and not having actual equity guarantees). The remaining 15 cases were investigated. After investigation, the above-mentioned four cases were decided by the meeting. The rest will be decided at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Suggest to the Ministry of Finance to Reduce Shop Guarantees</p>
<p>The Loan Committee, based on the ten principles of lending stipulated by the ministry, stipulates that credit loans must be guaranteed by two substantial commercial firms. Based on recent facts, the committee felt that it was difficult for the factories and shops applying for loans to find two shop guarantees in this economic downturn. In order to take care of industry and commerce and provide effective relief, it was reported that it had been decided to suggest to the Ministry of Finance to change the two shop guarantees specified in the ten principles to one shop guarantee. It must wait until the ministry's order is approved and implemented.</p>
<p>Noodle Company Industry Changes Procedures</p>
<p>In addition, the Noodle Company Association recently sent a letter to the Noodle Market Industry Association, requesting loans of 100 yuan, 50 yuan, and 30 yuan to the member stores of the association, and changing the guarantee procedures, proposing to use three-party joint guarantees certified by the association. The Loan Association was asked to review it. It was also decided at the meeting to allow the change, and the loan will be approved after consulting with the Ministry of Finance. The original letter reads: "Respectfully, according to a letter from the Noodle Company Industry Association on the 6th of this month, it was found that there are no less than hundreds of stores in the city run by members of the association, with capital ranging from several hundred yuan to over a thousand yuan. Before January 28th, there were over 500 stores. After the war, due to the economic downturn, most of them suffered losses and could not maintain their operations, and have closed down. Now there are only over 200 stores left. If we continue to sit idly by, they will all close down. Fortunately, your association has industrial and commercial credit small loans, which can truly give all members of the association hope for Chong Qing Lai Su. However, most member stores are small businesses, and can be divided into three grades. Grade A has capital of 1,000 yuan, Grade B has capital of 500 yuan, and Grade C has capital of over 300 yuan. It is proposed that Grade A borrow 100 yuan, Grade B borrow 50 yuan, and Grade C borrow 30 yuan. According to the methods promulgated by your association, there must be two substantial commercial firms as guarantors, but the members of the association are small businesses, so it is proposed to use three-party joint guarantees and be certified by the association to show credit, and to separately formulate a repayment plan. Is this feasible? We still ask for your approval so that we can start to implement it. It is a great convenience, etc." Upon receipt, it was found that it was not easy to find guarantees from two actual equity commercial firms for the small business of the industry. In order to implement the purpose of rescuing small industry and commerce, this provision should be changed accordingly. We hereby send a letter to your association to request your review and reply so that we can forward it. This is the most important thing. Respectfully to the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee."</p>

<h3 id="e91">Commissioner Liang's Talk on His Return from Inspecting South Africa: Studying the Causes of the Mistreatment of Overseas Chinese; Detailed Listing of the Shortcomings of Chinese Merchants That Should Be Remedied <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency reported that Liang Yugao, a commissioner sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to South Africa to inspect consulates and overseas Chinese affairs and to investigate commercial affairs, along with his secretary Xu Kuibo, departed from Shanghai on April 11th. After four months of inspection, they have completed their mission and returned home on the Dutch liner Swartenhondt. The ship docked at Wusongkou the night before last, and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. this morning. Friends and relatives of the two had received telegrams in advance and went to welcome them, which was very lively. The reporter, upon hearing the news, also drove to visit them. According to Liang's statement, as follows:</p>
<p>This Trip Lasted Four Months</p>
<p>He went to many places, including the Near East, Africa, the British island of Mauritius, where there are about 8,000 overseas Chinese; the French island of Reunion, where there are about 2,000 overseas Chinese; the French island of Madagascar, where there are about 3,000 overseas Chinese; the British island of Mayotte near Comoros, where there are about 200 overseas Chinese; the Portuguese East African cities of Lourenço Marques and Beira, where there are about 400 overseas Chinese each; the Union of South Africa, where there are about 3,000 overseas Chinese; and other small islands in the Indian Ocean, some with hundreds of overseas Chinese, some with dozens of overseas Chinese, and some with less than ten overseas Chinese, such as the British island of Sansibar and the British East African city of Mombasa. It is true that the footprints of overseas Chinese are all over the world. The overseas Chinese in the above-mentioned places deeply regret that they are far away from their motherland and that news is extremely isolated. However, they can all understand the international status and foreign policy of their motherland, and their patriotism is the same as that of overseas Chinese all over the world. It is a pity that their culture is low and they lack talent.</p>
<p>Efforts Should Be Made to Remedy It</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in the above-mentioned places are all from Guangdong and are mostly engaged in the grocery business, followed by carpentry and planting. Their economic situation is relatively good compared to overseas Chinese in the Union of South Africa. The others are not as good. The Union of South Africa is a gold-producing country, so it cannot avoid the impact of the economic downturn, but it is better than most countries in the world. However, the Union government imposes various unequal treatments on Asians and people of color in terms of law and society, which is unparalleled in any country in the world, such as immigration, rental, business, drinking, and transportation and entertainment. All the rights enjoyed by whites are absolutely not enjoyed by Asians and people of color (with some exceptions). Unfortunately, our Republic of China is located in Asia, and the Chinese nation is yellow, which has resulted in our overseas Chinese being subjected to double oppression, especially the more than 2,000 overseas Chinese living in Johannesburg (the gold-producing area) in the Transvaal province of the Union of South Africa and Pretoria, the capital of the Union of South Africa. We will report to the government in detail and find ways to negotiate the cancellation of it. We are studying</p>
<p>The Reasons Why the Union Mistreats Our Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>And the complex situation of the overseas Chinese in the Union, so we need to conduct various investigations, and guide the improvement of the consulate's affairs and the investigation of commercial affairs, so we spent more time in Johannesburg and Pretoria in the Union of South Africa, and the round trip also took 70 days. Therefore, we did not have time to go to Mumbai, Calcutta, and Yangon for inspection as originally planned. We received an urgent telegram from the government urging us to return to prepare for the Sino-Burmese border demarcation. As for international trade, there is great potential for development in the Union of South Africa, such as tea (Shanghai Wang Yutai's Qimen black tea sells very well), lace, silk embroidery, Lanzhou (Shandong Shangzhuang also has a good business), silk fabrics, clothing, porcelain, carpets, etc. can be promoted. Most of the Union of South Africa's imports are from Germany, but most of the import and export merchants are Jews, and the Jews strongly resist German goods, so although the Union government has a trade agreement with Germany, it cannot sell its goods. The Jews believe that the Japanese dumping policy is unfair, so they do not promote it. Moreover, the Union of South Africa does not welcome Japanese goods very much. It is common to see signs in front of stores that say "No Japanese goods sold here." Therefore, Chinese goods can be promoted in Africa. As for the wine and brandy in the Union of South Africa, although they are not as good as those produced in France, the price is very reasonable. The tobacco leaves are of good quality and the price is very cheap. We can also try to sell other products such as wool, raisins, fresh fruits, and salted fish. The politicians of the Union of South Africa have recently adopted a policy of gradually breaking away from the shackles of British rule and are eager to find new markets in the world. If our country can mutually sell goods with them, so that friendly relations can be enhanced, it is also a way to eliminate the mistreatment of our overseas Chinese. I have paid special attention to</p>
<p>Commercial Affairs on This Trip</p>
<p>Indeed, the number of our people overseas is increasing every year, and there is no way to reduce it. We have to seek the development of overseas trade in order to make up for it. Therefore, wherever I went, I talked to the general import and export merchants. They are all very willing to promote our country's goods, but they are very dissatisfied with our manufacturers. I will list them as follows, and I hope that if there is anything to be changed, change it, and if there is nothing to be commended, commend it. (1) They cannot pay attention to the credibility of the goods. Our country's goods are not without a market, but our manufacturers lack credibility. The goods sent are often not consistent with the samples, and when they write to inquire, there is no reply. In this case, there is only one transaction, and they dare not ask about it again. (2) The miscalculation of raising the price of goods. Some manufacturers, when they encounter overseas orders, think it is a good opportunity to make a fortune, and arbitrarily raise the price of goods. They do not know that the orderers are experienced and have a good understanding of the quality of goods and the level of prices. Therefore, there is no possibility of continued transactions. (3) The fallacy of gradually increasing the price of goods. When ordering goods from our country's manufacturers, the price of the same goods is different from the first batch, and the price of the second and third batches is different, often increasing batch by batch, which makes it very difficult for sellers. If they increase the price accordingly, they will be questioned by the buyers. If they do not increase the price, they will have no reason to sell at a loss, so they stop trading and no longer act as agents for promotion. (4) The samples are not exquisite and must be paid for. The reason why Japanese goods can sell well is entirely due to the power of giving away exquisite samples. Taking cloth as an example, one side shows the white cloth body, and the other side lists various colors, and the original price and shipping cost are clearly marked in detail. The English term is (C.J.F.jnStirling). The samples of Chinese goods are not only not as exquisite as Japanese goods, but some manufacturers do not allow them to be given away and must be paid for, which is a deterrent to those who argue for goods. (5) The packaging is too sloppy. Our country's manufacturers do not seem to pay much attention to the packaging of goods. Most of them think that the packaging is finished, and do not consider how to pack it so that it will not be lost, damaged, or damp. The orderers often suffer this loss, and the negotiation is ineffective, resulting in the cessation of transactions. (6) Prices should be converted into British currency (Stirling Quotation). Commerce in Africa is based on British shillings, and there are no exchange rate tables available for checking the conversion of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other currencies. When orderers write to inquire about the price of goods, our manufacturers do not know the reason and often reply with the price in national currency or Hong Kong currency, which makes it impossible to calculate. Even if they want to engage in purchasing, they have no way to start. In general, our manufacturers can easily improve the above-mentioned shortcomings, and my greatest impression on this trip is that Japanese goods are everywhere, and wherever there is traffic and densely populated places, such as train stations, there are Japanese goods on display, so that people unconsciously caress and visit. In Beira, East Africa, I heard that only one Japanese ship used to arrive every month, but now there are four or five ships, and Japanese goods are piled up like mountains, and the natives compete to buy them. I deeply sigh at their business methods, which are like mercury pouring on the ground, and there is no hole that they do not enter. We should imitate them. Our country's manufacturers suffer from the lack of large capital, so there are many shortcomings in the promotion methods, and it is difficult to compete with others. The plan for today is to hope that people who are enthusiastic about engaging in commercial affairs will gather strong capital and organize a</p>
<p>Large-Scale Company</p>
<p>Link up with various factories and act as the general agent for each factory, and work hard to develop overseas trade. Externally, (1) organize overseas national goods mobile exhibitions to promote them, (2) send overseas salesmen to widely solicit customers, as close as the Philippines, the British Malay Peninsula, and the Dutch East Indies, and as far as Africa and the islands in the Indian Ocean, round and round. Once commercial affairs are promoted, the international status can also be increased. Internally, study the conformity of goods and samples, the balance of prices, the improvement of samples and (C.L.F in Slirling) the detailed price list, the proper packaging, and the conversion of our country's currency system and the currency systems of various countries in the price, so that it is easy to calculate, and the company is absolutely responsible to the orderers. Other advertising promotions are also planned by the company, but all factories must obey the company's orders, and the company's profits are to extract certain commissions from the sales of certain factory's goods. With this method, it is expected that the results will be considerable. The key to doing business is to take the initiative to find people, not to wait for people to come to find us, and especially to win people's hearts, so that we can benefit step by step. It is heard that Mr. Liang will rest in Shanghai for one day before returning to Beijing to report on his mission.</p>
<h3 id="e92">New Initiatives in Shipping <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Hosted Press Yesterday</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, under orders to implement a new lifestyle movement on its ships, dispatched committee members from the Nanchang New Life Movement General Association to Shanghai for instructions. It was decided to start with training the stewards to gradually promote the movement and eradicate existing bad habits on the ships. Yesterday, Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the company, and Committee Member Yan, hosted a banquet for the press at the YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao Road. Over forty reporters from various newspapers attended. The two gentlemen reported on the progress of the initiative. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's Report</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's report stated, in brief, that since the New Life Movement was initiated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, it has been promoted in various regions. Last year, the General Association sent personnel to Shanghai to inspect the orderliness and cleanliness of the company's ships and docks. Many suggestions for reform were offered, and the current state of the stewards on the ships was deemed in urgent need of reform. The Ministry of Communications has repeatedly issued instructions for the company to rectify the stewards, but due to deeply ingrained habits, no results have been achieved. This April, the Ministry of Communications approved a telegram from the Military Affairs Commission Chairman’s Headquarters, forwarding the regulations for implementing the new shipping lifestyle movement to the company for implementation. In July, the General Association decided to first establish a New Life Training Class for stewards within the company, using the training of stewards as a starting point for promoting the new movement on all ships. Simultaneously, the General Association sent personnel to the company to discuss implementation. Currently, the preparations for the training class are largely complete. For the first class, one hundred and twenty stewards from the Xin Jiangtian ship will be selected to come ashore for training. Subsequently, other ships will be included in turn. The training period is two months. After the training, the company will assign them to positions accordingly. After receiving training, the stewards' service will undoubtedly be superior to before, directly satisfying passengers and indirectly providing a more secure guarantee for the stewards' livelihoods.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan's Speech</p>
<p>Following Mr. Liu, Mr. Yan delivered a speech, stating that since the New Life Movement was promoted by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in February of last year, it has been implemented in nineteen provincial capitals, the three major commercial ports of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, over eight hundred counties nationwide, and on various state-owned railways. However, shipping has been lacking. Chinese shipping has deeply ingrained bad habits, and if not improved, the future will be unimaginable. The General Association, recognizing this, first conducted an investigation and gathered opinions from various shipping companies. A plan for implementation was formulated, and he was dispatched to Shanghai to coordinate the effort. It has now been decided to start with steward training, and preparations are complete with the first training class about to begin. However, as this is a new initiative, there are bound to be misunderstandings from the outside, and the stewards on various ships may believe that there will be large-scale layoffs. However, the company is truly trying to improve the lives and income of each individual and provide them with valuable service skills. During his visit to Shanghai, he received assistance from all parties, which allowed the project to proceed smoothly, and he is deeply optimistic about the future of the New Life Movement. It is said that Mr. Yan will return to Jiangxi via Beijing within a few days to report on the progress.</p>

<p>Caused by Lounging on the Same Plank, Which Broke and Led to Drowning</p>
<p>A tragic drowning occurred yesterday afternoon at 1:40 under the New Rubbish Bridge in Suzhou Creek, claiming four lives. The Datong News Agency reporter has made a special effort to record the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Lounging on a Plank</p>
<p>There are many civilian boats docked along Suzhou Creek. These boats, commonly known as "Wudu boats," are inhabited by laborers who go ashore to work during the day and return to their boats to sleep at night. Their parents and families live on the boats, no different from a floating family. Yesterday afternoon at 1:40, under the north side of the New Rubbish Bridge in Suzhou Creek, which is where these boats congregate, planks were used to connect the boats for passage. At that time, the housewife of a Chen family boat (31 years old, from Yancheng) was relaxing on a plank with her 20-year-old eldest daughter and 4-year-old youngest daughter. Soon after, another housewife from a Zhang family boat (43 years old, same origin) also brought her 10+-year-old daughter to relax on the same plank.</p>
<p>Plank Breaks</p>
<p>Not long after, a boy named Wu Xiaogui (11 years old) from a boat (docked in front of the Bank of China warehouse) from Taizhou also walked onto the plank to relax. The plank, which was very thin and fragile, could not bear the weight of six people and suddenly broke, causing all six to fall into the water. The river in that area had recently been deepened by dredging ships sent by the Dredging Bureau, so after the six fell into the water, only the Zhang family boat housewife and the Chen family boat housewife's eldest daughter immediately resurfaced and were rescued. The other four sank deep into the water. Despite the best efforts of neighboring boats to rescue them, nothing was found until after 4 PM, when the crew members of the various boats finally retrieved them from under the boats. However, all four had already drowned.</p>
<p>Two Rescued</p>
<p>After the bodies were recovered, they were immediately transported by boat to the Neilu Jiaozui Water Patrol Station for reporting to the authorities for inspection. At the same time, the family members of the various boats were also summoned for questioning. When the Datong News Agency reporter went to the boats to investigate at around 7 PM last night, they had not yet been released.</p>

<p>Fan Xiaohouzi Confesses to Numerous Crimes - Public Security Bureau Telegrams Jiangsu Provincial Government to Take Custody. Fan Yizhi (51 years old), a notorious bandit leader from Qingjiang, also known as Fan Xiaohouzi, has been arrested. He commanded thousands of bandits and disciples, dominating over a dozen counties in Jiangbei, including Qingjiang, Funing, Huaian, and Xinghua, engaging in rape, robbery, murder, and arson for over a decade. Countless local people have suffered. The detective teams of various county public security bureaus have repeatedly arrested Fan's accomplices, including his third uncle Fan Chengyuan, second uncle Fan Youzhi, and several key members of his gang, and transferred them to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters. Simultaneously, a large reward was offered for the arrest of the fugitive bandit leader Fan Yizhi and his eldest son Fan Dingtang. However, Fan fled to Shanghai to evade punishment and has been at large for six years. The Shanghai Commander of the 9th District Bandit Suppression Headquarters dispatched detectives to Shanghai, but they were unable to apprehend him. Later, Ji Yuanpu, Chief of the Detective Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned that Fan was hiding at No. 33 Junwei Lane, Wuding Road, in the Public Concession and had recently been seen in teahouses near Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. Detective Squad Leader Chen Guangyan, Deputy Squad Leader Chen Fusheng, Yang Yufu, Xu Yaoting, and others were dispatched in disguise to investigate. As a result, at around noon yesterday, they collaborated with Police Officer Wang Dianjia from Post No. 7 of the Xundao Street Police Station and arrested him inside the Gongjin Teahouse at No. 203 Qiaojia Road in Nanshi. During interrogation, the bandit leader Fan Yizhi confessed that he was Fan Yizhi, 51 years old, also known as Fan Xiaohouzi. After his second uncle Fan Youzhi and third uncle Fan Chengyuan were arrested, he fled from his original home in Qingjiang to Shanghai with fellow villagers from Qingjiangpu six years ago and resided at No. 33 Junwei Lane, Wuding Road, in the Public Concession. He did not deny committing numerous crimes. He was ordered to be detained, and the confession was submitted to Director Cai for record. It is said that after Director Cai reviewed the confession, he telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the 9th District Bandit Suppression Headquarters to prepare documents to come to Shanghai to take custody of him and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Using a Hired Woman as a Puppet to Cheat Five Dou of Rice <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Zengtai Rice Shop Defrauded - Lin Changshi Granted Bail</p>
<p>Recently, the hearts of people in Shanghai have become increasingly treacherous, and the tricks of fraud have become even more bizarre. In front of the Zengtai Rice Shop at No. 130 Bailinan Road in Western Shanghai, a man wearing a silk shirt, about thirty years old, suddenly arrived with a simple-looking middle-aged female servant on the afternoon before yesterday. He claimed to be buying five dou of high-quality white rice, worth six yuan, and asked the old store clerk to deliver the rice and bring back the money. The shop then ordered Zhang Xingfu, an employee, to follow with the rice. When they reached near Zhaofeng Garden, the man suddenly said to Zhang, "This rice is being bought on behalf of a cohabitant, so I need to open a receipt. You put the rice down by the roadside temporarily, and I'll watch it here. Luckily, it's not far. You go quickly and open it. If you're worried, you can order the servant to go with you." Zhang believed that with the servant accompanying him, he could trust him, so he immediately took the woman back to the shop to get the receipt. However, when he returned, the man was nowhere to be seen. Zhang then twisted the woman back to the shop to report what happened. When questioned, the woman claimed that her name was Lin Changshi, 35 years old, from Wujiang. She had just arrived in Shanghai from her hometown. At noon today, the man, who claimed to be the master of the house, hired a female servant from the Hang hiring agency opposite the Gengxin Theater in Zhabei. He told me to follow him to his residence to help as a servant. He took a taxi, and I took a rickshaw. We went to Great British Road, then changed to a tram and came here to call for rice. I really don't know where the master went. His address is written on a note left at the hiring agency. The shop, believing that she was in cahoots to swindle the rice, immediately called the police to detain her at the Caojiadu Branch. After the officers questioned her separately, they ordered Detective Tu Yixin to go to the hiring agency to inquire. According to the agency, the man behaved generously and, after coming to select Lin Changshi, said that since her home was far away at No. 41 Donghan Bili Road in Hongkou, he wrote a note with the address and left it there, instructing her to follow him. The officer then went to Donghan Bili Road according to the address and found that the address was a pawnshop, indicating that the man's fraudulent scheme was extremely clever. He returned to the bureau to report. Since there was insufficient evidence to prove that the defendant woman was in cahoots, she was granted bail separately. It is hoped that all shops in Shanghai will pay attention and be cautious.</p>

<p>Gangster Yu Qirui Arrested and Sentenced to One Year and Six Months</p>
<p>Fang Qianyuan, owner of the Huamei Beef Shop at No. 371 Bazhi Road, received four threatening letters in the real name of Ying Si from the 30th of last month to the 9th of this month, demanding 20,000 yuan. The letters stated that a meeting would be arranged in front of a factory on Zhiyuan Road in Zhabei, otherwise there would be danger this month. Fang dispatched his younger brother Fang Qianxing to observe the situation at Qingyun Road Bridge. A Tongzhou child named Su Haitao, whose father was a rickshaw puller and lived on Tiantong Temple Road, claimed to be sent by Ying Si to collect the money. As a result, he was told to relay that there was no money and that this matter was not to be done. At noon on the 9th, another letter came, inserted through the back door of the meat shop, still requesting a talk at the Zhiyuan Road factory. Fang Qiang was then reported to the Hongkou Patrol Room, which dispatched Chinese Detective Chen Lianjing, Detectives Wang Ronghao and Wang Shubei, and reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau. Detective Li Feizhi No. 133 and A Lin knew that the incident was being carried out by Yu Qirui, a Ningbo native, who was waiting for news in a teahouse at No. 886 Zhejiang Road. They went secretly with Detective Chen and others to identify and arrest him, brought him to the patrol room, and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, described the previous situation in detail, presented the letters for examination, and stated that the defendant had admitted in the patrol room that he wrote all five letters and requested an investigation. Then Detective Chen reported on the arrest of the defendant. Fang Qian and Fang Qianyuan's son testified to everything. When questioned, the defendant stammered, saying that he actually had a grudge against Fang Qianyuan and did not want money, and begged for leniency. Judge Xiao Xiefen rendered a verdict in court, sentencing Yu Qirui to one year and six months in prison, and the threatening letters were confiscated.</p>

<p>Addicted to Gambling at the Age of 64 - Committed Suicide by Poisoning After Accumulating Debts</p>
<p>Jin Acai, a Ningbo native residing at No. 68 Burton Road, is 34 years old and works as a fishmonger. His father, Jin Huaiyou, is over 64 years old and addicted to gambling. He repeatedly lost battles, accumulating debts. Recently, unable to make amends, he developed a pessimistic outlook and secretly ingested poison to commit suicide the day before yesterday. When his son discovered him groaning in bed, he sent him to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Hongkou Patrol Room, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then transported to the Philip Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Song Genshan from the First Special District Local Court visited the morgue to examine the body. After questioning Jin Acai, he confirmed the previous situation. Mr. Song then ruled that the deceased Jin Huaiyou, male, had indeed died from ingesting poison during his lifetime. The body was allowed to be taken back by his son Jin Acai for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Shanghai Fraudulent Japanese Offender Arrested in Dalian <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>According to the Manchuria Daily News, in mid-April, Fujinuma Keijiro, who defrauded 40,000 yuan from No. OK14, Kunshan Road, Shanghai, secretly fled to Dalian. After receiving a report from the Shanghai Consulate, the Dalian Police Department searched everywhere. He was recently arrested at the home of his mistress, a prostitute named Tokiko, at No. 32 Saimacho in the city. The Shanghai Consulate was notified and will go to Dalian to take custody of him. After arriving in Dalian, the suspect hung a sign for the Greater Japan Imperial Way Supporting Association at No. 4 Kadamacho, installed his cohabitant Inoue Hidejiro as president, and hired several diplomats to distribute pamphlets promoting the imperial way in various directions. In reality, it was all a sham, with no actual work being done. Furthermore, the printing costs of the pamphlets were not paid, and fraud was the only goal. With this arrest, the number of people involved through their relationship with his mistress is very large, and the situation is likely to develop significantly.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Construction Project Meeting for the Fuyou Road Mosque <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Meeting to be Held Today at the Zhenxing Jade Market</p>
<p>The Fuyou Road Mosque in the city has been built for many years and is one of the most popular gathering places for Muslims at sea. Recently, it has fallen into disrepair. The former chairman of the mosque, Mr. Ha Shaofu, recognizing this, advocated for its reconstruction. Unfortunately, he passed away before realizing his ambition. Therefore, other directors have continued his will, preparing for many years, soliciting donations, and meticulously planning. Now they have started construction, renovating all but the three main halls. A five-bay, steel-framed concrete three-story building is being constructed. The first floor will house the reception room, funeral parlor, gas stove room, and toilet room. The entire second floor will be used as a bathing room. The third floor will be used as a library, conference room, lecture room, religious leader's room, and storage room. A moon-viewing tower will be built on the four-story platform for observing the moon. The facilities are quite comprehensive, and the project requires a considerable amount of funding. The mosque will hold a meeting at 10:00 AM on August 11th at the Zhenxing Jade Market on Houjia Road to discuss the entire construction project. It is expected that there will be a grand scene when members of the religion attend the meeting.</p>

<p>-Taxpayer Society Sends Letters to Four Groups-</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayer Society sent letters yesterday to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, and the French Concession Chinese Taxpayer Society, stating: We are writing to inform you that the Shanghai Telephone Company's bills often include a charge of five jiao or several jiao for users connected to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. Our association has often received protests regarding this matter. Therefore, on July 12th, we sent a letter to the Public Concession Public Works Department, instructing the company to record the following facts on the toll bills and not to be ambiguous or use trickery: (1) Date, (2) Time, (3) Telephone number called, (4) Connected or not connected, (5) Call duration. Such records would allow users to understand where their number is, and it would be easy to investigate whether they have any contact or familiarity with users of those numbers. For those who never used that type of call and have declared so in writing, the company should immediately remove the charge and, in the future, not connect their phone to users of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau who request such connections. In this way, users can avoid suffering illegal losses and make the company respect users' intentions and avoid the suspicion of illegal income. If the company's bills do not list these items clearly, then according to commercial practice, there should be a legal right to verify them. If the company continues to include these toll charges on the bill after the user has declared that they do not need this type of call, then it should be considered a separate act and cannot be recovered from innocent parties. Users should not suffer in silence because the amount is small and the negotiation is troublesome. Even small legal interests should not be lost. As this matter concerns the public interest, we are writing to your associations, requesting that you inform your members so that they may protect their legal rights and promote public welfare.</p>

<p>Ordered Assistance Society to Repay in Installments</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Binyan, a leader in the Zhabei business community, was sued by creditors for advancing money and using his private property as collateral during the Jiangzhe War in the Republic of China year 13. The Supreme Court ruled in the third instance, scheduling an auction for yesterday. All sectors of Zhabei believe that Mr. Wang has been burdened by public affairs and have jointly convened meetings to provide assistance. They organized the Zhabei Assistance Council for Wang Binyan, who suffered due to public affairs, and divided into groups to petition party and government agencies and public organizations in the city for relief. Therefore, the court did not auction Mr. Wang Binyan's private residence yesterday and temporarily suspended execution, ordering the Assistance Council for Wang Binyan to repay in installments.</p>

<p>Selling Prices Mostly Below Cost</p>
<p>The Daxin and Huahua Silk and Satin Stores, twin brands located at the intersection of Three Horse Road and Shilu Road, have been open for many years. Recently, the existing address was insufficient, and a new location was rented at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road to expand business. Before the relocation, over ten thousand items of inventory accumulated over the years, as well as various new and fashionable silks and satins, were reduced in price. The joint relocation grand sale was scheduled to take place at the original address, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the two stores have completed the arrangements after two days of closed-door preparation. The sale starts today. It is reported that the cheapest items are only 20-30% of the cost, which can be described as the most significant sacrifice in the city. It is expected that customers will be exceptionally crowded, and there may be unexpected excitement. The cheapest and highest-quality goods will be obtained by those who are quick on their feet. To prevent excessive squeezing, the store plans to temporarily close the iron gates when necessary to limit access.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Youth Jumps into the Sea from the Xin Ningshao Ship, Leaving Behind a 19-Year-Old Widow - Smiled at Her Before Dying - Family Devastated by the News - No Need for Suicide, Truly a Sin <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Athlete Zhu Qiming boarded the Xin Ningshao ship of the Ningshao Shipping Company's Shanghai-Ningbo line on the 5th of this month. While the ship was passing the Lizitongsha waters, the young man suddenly jumped into the sea and committed suicide. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The Datong News Agency reporter, to understand the cause of his death, went to No. 6 Songtong Lane, Qipu Road, to inquire about the details from his family. The information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Deceased's Family Background</p>
<p>The deceased was from Zhangxiang Village, Dongting East Mountain, Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. His family moved to Shanghai over 40 years ago. His parents are both alive. His father's name is Changrong. The deceased has four sisters and two brothers. The eldest sister is 18 years old, and the others are 9, 5, and 3 years old. The eldest brother is 15 years old, and the second brother is 13 years old. All are studying at the Municipal Feihong Elementary School. His wife, Yu, is 19 years old and has been married for only three years. She has not yet had any children.</p>

<p>Romantic Nature</p>
<p>The deceased graduated from the Municipal Feihong Senior Elementary School at the age of 16. Because he could not afford to continue his education, his father, who worked in the copper mold electroengraving department of the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company, introduced him to the Zhonghua Book Company as a trainee. In the year 21 of the Republic of China (when he was 19 years old), he and his father resigned from their positions at the Zhonghua Book Company. Afterwards, father and son accepted copper mold electroengraving jobs at home. Because the deceased was intelligent, he was very skilled in the trade. However, he had a romantic nature and loved making friends, so his expenses increased daily. He was unable to fulfill his wishes for the trade and complained about it. His father advised him that if he had a better occupation, he could change careers, but he remained depressed.</p>
<p>Fond of Sports</p>
<p>The deceased was very interested in sports during his lifetime. He was a member of the Zhonghua Amateur Team in the Yangshupu Hardware Factory. The team captain was Wang Pengfei, and he and the deceased were very close. All the team members respected him as their leader. A few days before his suicide, a member of the team, who had been unemployed for several years, told the deceased of his distress and said he would end his life. The deceased tried his best to comfort him and borrowed ten yuan from Team Captain Wang on his behalf. It was unexpected that his friend would live because of him, and he would resolutely commit suicide, truly beyond anyone's expectations. It is also said that Team Captain Wang Pengfei cried several times after hearing the news of the deceased's death.</p>
<p>Before Death</p>
<p>When the Datong News Agency reporter visited his family, the deceased's parents, brothers, and sisters were all in one room, looking very miserable. His wife, becoming a young widow so suddenly, was especially grief-stricken. Then the deceased's mother pointed to a portrait on the wall. The reporter looked at it and saw a note written by the deceased on the photo, "Ashamed, a youth of the times, late winter 1934." The reporter then obtained a four-inch photo from the family. He looked energetic and loving of nature. They also said that in the days before his death, the deceased's attitude was the same as usual. On the 5th of this month (the day of his suicide), at 1 PM, he stared at his wife for a long time, followed by a smile, and then wanted to go out. His wife asked where he was going. He replied that he was going to take a photo at the Datonghui Photo Studio. After saying that, he hurried to the Yangshupu Zhonghua Amateur Team to play ball for about an hour. He also drank a bowl of green bean soup and then left. The family, because he did not return that night, ran around asking and was anxiously distressed. On the 8th of this month, they were shocked by the news in the newspaper. They went to the Ningshao Shipping Company to collect his belongings and read his suicide note, which was confirmed to be the deceased's handwriting. The whole family was grief-stricken. As for his body, it has not yet been found.</p>
<h3 id="e105">City Chamber of Commerce Letter to the Bureau of Finance: Requesting Flexible Methods for Self-Payment of House Tax <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai and Wusong Are Forty to Fifty Li Apart; Time and Economic Losses Are Significant</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Finance yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, on the 9th of this month, according to a letter from our Wusong branch, it stated that our branch recently received a joint letter from various businesses, stating: 'Respectfully, we find that although the Wusong area is under the jurisdiction of Shanghai, it is quite far from the prosperous area of Shanghai. Therefore, various administrative agencies of the city have personnel stationed in Wusong to facilitate matters and care for the common people. The merchants and residents of Wusong praise this convenience. The same applies to the Bureau of Finance's collection of house tax. Collectors are stationed in Wusong year-round to collect taxes. However, this month, a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance suddenly ordered that, starting from the autumn term of the fourteenth year of the Republic, all those with a house tax of ten yuan or more must pay it themselves to the Shanghai Municipal Bank, and it is limited to be paid from the 1st of this month to the 10th of this month, with a 2% surcharge for late payments. After receiving the order, the merchants were shocked, as Shanghai and Wusong are forty to fifty li apart, and a round trip by boat or car takes no less than five or six hours. The time spent is already extremely uneconomical, and adding the travel expenses to the house tax is even less desirable for the merchants and residents. Furthermore, according to the Bureau of Finance, tax households with less than ten yuan are still being collected by collectors stationed in Wusong. This approach benefits neither the public nor the private sector, and only increases the travel expenses of the common people. Also, according to the original intention of the Bureau of Finance, perhaps it is to reduce the responsibility of the collectors and prevent corruption, so large households are ordered to pay directly to the bank. However, the Wusong area now also has a Xinhua Bank office, and money shops such as Long Mao Zhuang, all of which have outstanding credit and strong financial resources, can be entrusted to collect taxes on behalf of the bureau, just like the Farmers Bank of the Interior collects land taxes and sets up branches in rural areas. Therefore, the merchants and residents believe that the Bureau of Finance's self-payment of house tax is only feasible in areas close to the urban area, and is really inconvenient in the Wusong area. Therefore, they jointly request that your Chamber forward this request to the Bureau of Finance, allowing the old method of sending collectors to collect taxes to continue. If there is concern about collectors engaging in corruption, the bureau can entrust banks or money shops in the Wusong area to collect taxes after issuing notices, so that merchants and residents can pay nearby within the time limit. We look forward to your assistance.' Upon receiving this, we found that at a time when all industries are declining, enabling the common people to spend one less cent unexpectedly means maintaining their livelihood for a little longer. The matters stated by the merchants are true, and the method is also feasible. Accordingly, we hereby report the situation to your Chamber, hoping that you will quickly forward it to the Bureau of Finance and make changes to the collection of house tax in the Wusong area. We truly value our public friendship, etc." Upon receiving this, we found that our Chamber has received letters from the noodle industry and the lumber industry one after another, and has forwarded them to your bureau twice, requesting changes, but we have not received approval. However, in your bureau's reply to the lumber industry, No. 5858, on May 31st, it stated that "convenience will be provided to households paying house tax themselves." Our Chamber believes that in order to implement this principle thoroughly, the time and financial resources of the tax households should be taken into consideration. Now, Shanghai and Wusong are forty to fifty li apart, and a round trip by boat or car takes no less than five or six hours. The time spent is already wasted, and in addition to the house tax, the round-trip travel expenses cause even more economic losses. All of this is inconsistent with the Bureau's so-called principle of facilitating tax households. Moreover, with collectors stationed in Wusong and the self-payment method for tax households coexisting, the government is inevitably wasting salaries, and the collectors are almost like parasites accompanying meals. The so-called "no benefit to both the public and private sectors" by the branch office is indeed a valid argument. If your bureau believes that the Wusong area is relatively far away and the situation is different, canceling the self-payment method for tax households would be greatly appreciated by the merchants and residents of the town. Otherwise, before the Municipal Bank establishes branches in the Wusong area, entrusting other reliable firms to collect taxes nearby would also alleviate the difficulties. Since your bureau's principle for tax households is to facilitate procedures, we urge you to choose one of the two methods requested by our Chamber, reply, and implement it.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Telegram from the Laohekou Public Security Bureau Requesting Relief <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Duan Wengong, Director of the Public Security Bureau of Laohekou, Hubei, wrote: "To the Editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao: I have learned that Laohekou City was built in the middle of the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. It connects Qin and Long in the north, and Ba and Shu on the sides. It is located upstream of Jing and Xiang, and has long been known as a military town in northern Hubei. In addition, it borders the Han River, with convenient boat transportation, a gathering of products, and a convergence of merchants. The central and local tax revenues, as well as various financial institutions, are also numerous. In the 18th and 19th years of the Republic, the population reached over 100,000, and commerce reached its peak. Recently, it has been affected by the current situation, and the market is depressed, which is very different from the past. Unexpectedly, heaven has not been satisfied with the disaster, and fog and rain have caused calamity. From July 3rd to 7th, it lasted for five days and nights without ceasing. In addition, mountain torrents broke out, and the Han River suddenly poured into the city, turning the entire city into a swamp. The water depth ranged from three or four feet to more than ten feet. Countless houses in the city collapsed, and thousands of thatched houses outside the Huacheng Gate were washed away to the east, leaving only rubble. The flood victims inside and outside the city clung to the roofs and treetops, calling for help, which was unbearable to hear. The Bureau, together with the garrisoned troops, organized rescue teams to rush to rescue them in different ways. It is estimated that more than 9,000 men, women, old, and young have been rescued. They were then selected to be housed in higher places and gathered together. At the same time, gentry and merchants were convened to discuss relief measures, and it was decided to temporarily have the shops and residents with less severe disasters donate congee to barely sustain life. At the same time, letters were sent to various organizations and groups to rush to raise more than 2,000 yuan for emergency relief, which was distributed separately. However, the disaster is extremely serious, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. It is estimated that more than 200 zhang of the city walls were washed down by the flood, and all the wharves along the coast were swept into the torrent. More than 6,000 houses collapsed, and the number of flood victims who were displaced and cut off from their livelihoods reached more than 10,000, which is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. Now, to implement relief, it is not a work that can be done with a cartload of firewood and a cup of water. Moreover, to plan for the restoration of prosperity, there must be a comprehensive plan. I have long admired the gentlemen of your newspaper for their concern for the people and their compassion, and their enthusiasm for disaster relief in the past. I dare to ask you to have the spirit of treating the hunger of others as your own and the drowning of others as your own, and to fulfill the wish of loving our compatriots and helping them. Call out loudly, and the mountains will respond. The survivors of the disaster can entrust their lives, and the dying business community can be revived. The people will be fortunate, and the region will be fortunate. In addition to requesting the provincial government to quickly provide relief, I am sending thirty-seven photos of the flood with this letter, and I beg you to make plates and publish them daily to show the disaster situation, and I beg you to express your opinions and call for help to all parties. I respectfully lead more than 60,000 citizens to bow nine times to ask, and I respectfully wish you good writing. I hope you will understand. Sincerely, Duan Wengong, Director of the Public Security Bureau of Laohekou, Hubei, July 30th."</p>

<p>Departing Today on the Empress of Canada</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Maode, General Manager of the China Mainland Commercial Company, is departing overseas today on the Empress of Canada to discuss business in the United States, Canada, and other places. The company has been operating for seven years and has developed its business. It enjoys a high reputation among the import and export industries run by Chinese people. It was recently designed for the Ministry of Railways to manufacture medicine bridge piers, and it has been publicly tendered to undertake this large batch of wood.</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Maode expects that the railways in Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo will use this to expand branch lines. It is believed that China's railways' use of medicinal bridge timber is a pioneer. According to the records of various railways in the United States and Canada, the bridges built with medicinal timber are still in good condition after 50 years of use, and the cost is 40% lower than using iron and concrete. It is said that Mr. Cao's trip will also include an inspection of the forestry industry in Canada, and he is expected to return to China in three months, at which time he will contribute what he has learned to the Chinese people.</p>

<p>Puyi Cemetery was first initiated and created by Mr. Liu, a philanthropist in Shanghai. Since construction began last year, it has been completed. The cemetery is located on Zhenda Road, between Dachang and Zhenru. It can be reached directly by car from both the Shanghai-Tai Road and Jiaotong Road lines. The transportation is convenient. It covers a total area of more than 80 mu, with about 3,000 burial plots. The various designs are meticulous and complete, and the plots are spacious and the soil is high and dry, making them very suitable. The Puyi Shanzhuang Board of Directors is responsible for permanent management, which is different from the nature of business operations and is especially appropriate.

<h3 id="e119">New Soviet Trade Company Hosts New Pharmaceutical Industry <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The New Soviet Trade Company, entrusted by the British Merchants Assistance Company, is acting as an agent for Soviet medical chemical raw materials and medicines. The company's colleagues hosted leaders of the new pharmaceutical industry at the Jinlong Restaurant on the evening of the 9th. Among those who attended were managers from various pharmacies such as Sino-British, China-America, Sino-Western, Sino-French, Jihuatang, and Jicheng, such as Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Bangjun, Zhu Ruichen, Yuan Hesong, and Tu Kaizheng. Xu Guanqun chaired the meeting, reporting on the company's preparation process and purpose, generally saying that the market is sluggish and the purchasing power of the Chinese people is weak. Therefore, it is an urgent need to purchase cheap and high-quality Soviet products to replace expensive European and American goods of equal quality. For the sake of shared benefits, all new pharmaceutical industry patrons will be supplied at the lowest prices. Then, guest Xu Xiaochu gave a speech, generally saying that our country's raw material manufacturing is not completely independent and depends on foreign countries for a large amount. The raw materials are expensive, but the finished product prices cannot be raised due to market conditions. At this time of industrial decline, the pharmaceutical industry is not without its impact. Now, the New Soviet Company has come forward to shoulder the mission of solving the raw material problem, which is good news for the new pharmaceutical industry. Soviet products are cheap and high-quality, replacing European and American goods of the same quality but higher prices, reducing the burden on customers and greatly helping the national economy and people's livelihood. At that time, guests and hosts exchanged opinions and raised their glasses, which was quite prosperous at the time. At ten o'clock, the guests and hosts dispersed happily.</p>

<p>Mr. Shi Renwang, a broadcasting giant, is famous throughout the country for his harmonica and accordion playing skills.

<p>5. Teachers</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of teacher training, it is divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Training of Short-Term Primary School Teachers: After the start of the first phase of compulsory education in each province and city, short-term primary school teacher training classes should be widely established in senior middle schools and normal schools at the provincial, municipal, or county level. Students with a junior middle school education level should be recruited to study primary school teaching materials and teaching methods. After completing the training and passing the examination, they will be given a certificate allowing them to serve as teachers in short-term primary schools.</p>
<p>(2) Training of One-Year Short-Term Primary School Teachers: During the first phase, each province and city should recruit people with fluent writing skills, rich common sense, and a desire to become teachers in short-term primary schools. After passing the examination, they will be given a certificate allowing them to serve as one-year short-term primary school teachers. When necessary, civil servants may be ordered to serve in short-term primary schools.</p>
<p>(3) Training to Improve Private School Teachers: Junior middle schools or normal schools at the county or municipal level, as well as large-scale county primary schools, should establish training classes for private school teachers, recruiting private school teachers to specialize in teaching materials and teaching methods for short-term primary school courses. After short-term training and passing the examination, they will be given a certificate allowing them to serve as improved private school teachers.</p>
<p>(4) Qualification Examination for Primary School Teachers: Each province and city should promote normal schools, simple normal schools, and simple normal school departments according to local needs to cultivate primary school teachers. They should also find ways to provide unqualified primary school teachers with opportunities for further study and obtain qualifications in accordance with the qualification examination regulations.</p>
<p>6. School Buildings and Equipment</p>
<p>Regarding school buildings and equipment, due to insufficient funding for compulsory education, we can only make do with what we have for the time being. However, funds must be raised to build formal school buildings and equipment for the future establishment of ordinary primary schools. The principles of school buildings and equipment are reported below:</p>
<p>(1) School Buildings: Short-term primary schools set up in each primary school district should make full use of local government offices, ancestral halls, and other buildings, or rent private houses. If there is nothing to rent, simple sheds may be temporarily built for use. Each school district should select a suitable location and prepare to build formal school buildings for ordinary primary schools within ten years. If they are unable to build, they may be assisted by the county and municipal governments.</p>
<p>(2) Equipment: The equipment for short-term primary schools should be handled with reference to the equipment for ordinary primary schools. Each school district should raise sufficient equipment funds within ten years to prepare for the conversion of short-term primary schools into ordinary primary schools.</p>
<p>7. Agencies for Implementing Compulsory Education</p>
<p>The implementation of compulsory education is organized by the Ministry of Education at the central level, by the education administrative agencies of provinces and cities at the provincial and municipal levels, and by the education departments and bureaus at the county and municipal levels. Each level of organizing agency should form a committee to assist in the implementation.</p>
<p>8. Principles of Rewards and Punishments</p>
<p>(1) The state of compulsory education implementation should be regarded as a special consideration when evaluating the performance of local administrative personnel.</p>
<p>(2) People who donate funds to support compulsory education may be rewarded in accordance with the regulations on rewarding donations for education.</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry of Education will separately formulate regulations on rewards and punishments for promoting compulsory education.</p>
<p>The measures for implementing compulsory education have been largely reported. The goal of compulsory education is to transform the environment, adapt to the environment, and increase the people's ability to live. Therefore, education must take into account the needs of society. China is a vast country with abundant resources, but transportation is inconvenient. Not only does each province have its own customs, habits, and languages, but each county and each place also has its own customs, habits, and languages. With such regional separation, people live in different environments, making it difficult to unite. Now, we must rely on the power of compulsory education to unify social customs and habits, so that everyone can have a common spirit from different living environments, and develop their production skills and increase their interest in life according to the needs of the time and place. Not only will there be no illiteracy in the country, but foolishness will be transformed into intelligence, poverty will be transformed into wealth, disease will be transformed into health, and sin will be transformed into light. With a whole and healthy citizenry, we can jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and ensuring its survival. Why worry that the country cannot be strong and the nation cannot be revived? Therefore, I believe that compulsory education is the most fundamental and effective work for saving the country, ensuring its survival, and revitalizing the nation. I hope that all compatriots across the country will work together to assist the government. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e132">Fourth Meeting of the Literacy Education Committee <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday at the Municipal Government. All members of the committee attended, chaired by Mayor Wu, the chairman. (1) Reporting items: (1) The committee's previous survey of illiterate people has now been statistically analyzed. Excluding a portion of children who have already been surveyed by the Municipal Education Bureau and are no longer included, the remaining number is 434,452, including 208,161 men and 226,291 women. (2) The committee's publicity and survey work this time has achieved good results, thanks to the assistance of many parties. A type of certificate has now been produced to reward them, and 68 certificates have been issued. (3) The committee's training for teachers of literacy schools was completed on schedule on June 23. In addition to dismissing two who performed poorly, the rest were assigned to various districts as teachers. The selection of temporary duty officers in each district was also completed by the committee on June 24. (4) The committee's first phase of 220 literacy schools, with more than 1,300 classes, opened on schedule on July 1. After repeated inspections by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the committee, the results are satisfactory. The number of students who actually attended last month is currently being statistically analyzed. (5) The committee's experimental work in the Jiangwan Experimental District has been completed and it has been converted into an ordinary district. Mr. Jiang Wenbao, the original director of the Experimental District, has resigned and Mr. Wu Chuijiu, a municipal committee member of the district, has been appointed to succeed him. The details of the district's experiment have been detailed in the special issue of this issue of the Education Magazine, and will not be repeated here. (6) Because of the special nature of labor literacy education, the committee has added a labor education section to the Secretariat, and appointed Mr. Wang Gang, director of the labor welfare section of the Third Bureau of the Social Affairs Bureau, to concurrently serve as the director of the section. Single measures have now been established to investigate illiteracy and urge factories to set up labor literacy classes on schedule. (7) The second volume of the adult literacy textbook and the second volume of the children's literacy textbook were both published last month and have been distributed for use. (8) Although more than 500 sub-teams of the literacy education service team have been established, the work situation is difficult to be optimistic. It is probably because it is during the summer vacation, and it is planned to step up supervision from September. (9) The committee's epidemic prevention campaign for students in literacy schools has begun, and the Health Bureau has sent personnel to administer vaccinations. (10) Various important regulations previously passed by the committee have been approved for record by the Shanghai Municipal Government and forwarded to the Ministry of Education. 2. Discussion items: 1. The draft interim measures for civic training are hereby submitted for review. Approved by resolution. 2. The rules for the study group of literacy schools are hereby submitted for review. Approved by resolution. 3. The 50 new life items in the classroom of literacy schools are hereby submitted for review. Approved by resolution. 4. The committee plans to subsidize each district office 1 yuan per school per month for the civic training held in each district, totaling 220 yuan per month and 3,420 yuan per year (calculated in November). It is proposed to submit this to the Municipal Government for approval. Approved by resolution. (5) The committee hereby formulates measures for the academic performance examination of students in literacy schools for review. Resolution: Appoint three members, Tao Baichuan, Hong Kui, and Tong Hangbai, to review. (6) Should the committee's literacy school teachers' winter uniforms be manufactured and distributed for review? It was resolved not to manufacture and distribute them again. (7) The salary of the committee's literacy school teachers was originally calculated based on the number of classes and the number of people taught. Those with more than 40 people will be given a salary of 6 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen per class. However, how should the exact number of these 40 people be examined and verified, and how should the salary be paid for classes with less than 40 people in order to be fair? Please review the proposal. Resolution: It was decided to review and decide based on the roll call book of the literacy school. Those with less than 40 people will be paid generously in proportion. (8) Can the certificate of academic performance of students in private literacy schools under the guidance of the Municipal Party Department (that is, educational certificate) be issued by the committee for the Municipal Party Department to assess and forward, or should it still be forwarded by the district office? Please review the proposal. Resolution: It was decided to allow the Municipal Party Department to be responsible for the assessment and forwarding to the meeting for record. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Pudong Middle School</p>
<p>Pudong Middle School has made great improvements this semester, and the number of applicants is very enthusiastic.

<p>Junyi Middle School</p>
<p>The second phase of the Junyi Middle School's enrollment examination was originally scheduled for August 25. Later, because students from afar had already come to Shanghai to wait for the examination, the school, in order to facilitate these students, submitted a proposal to the Enrollment Committee, chaired by Li Qigang, for discussion and approval. All students who have registered are allowed to take a special examination on August 15. Because the number of new students has increased suddenly this year, fearing that the number of places will be insufficient, the original old students and the admitted new students are all limited to coming to the school to determine the number of places before August 25.</p>

<p>Therefore, after dinner, when the children gathered in the classroom to do some more "fun things," Mrs. Pei also came slowly, with a violin in her hand. After saying a word to her husband, she went straight to Naide's side, who was sitting in a corner, watching with great interest.</p>
<p>"Now, my child, play a piece for us. Our orchestra just needs a violin, and I think you can play it well."</p>
<p>She thought he might hesitate, but he immediately took the old violin, holding it so carefully and lovingly that it was clear that music was his passion.</p>
<p>He only said, "Madam, I will do my best," and then touched the string with the bow, as if eager to hear the faint sound that had been silent for a long time again.</p>
<p>There was a lot of noise in the room, but Naide was oblivious to everything else. He just played for himself, extremely happy, and unaware of anything else. What he played was just a tune sung by a black man, which was often performed by street musicians, but this immediately attracted the children's attention, making them quiet down until they all stood listening intently, admiring in amazement. They gradually gathered around him, and Mr. Pei also came closer to observe carefully! Because Naide suddenly felt like a fish in water, he just played, losing all his shyness. Later, his eyes shone brightly, and his cheeks were as red as fire.

<h3 id="e135">Wonderful Tennis Match Amid Continuous Applause, Xu Chengji Defeats Carlson, Xu's Technical Progress Show is Extremely Wonderful, Xu Lin Doubles Wins Carlson Shi Guiya, Xu Chengji vs. Qiu Feihai Today <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Our country's Davis Cup player Xu Chengji defeated Carlson, last year's Shanghai singles champion and manager of our country's Davis Cup team, in continuous applause yesterday by two to one, with scores of 4-6, 6-3, and 6-4. The performance of both sides was extremely exciting and moving, and can be called the most wonderful tennis performance in Shanghai this season. Xu has made significant progress in technical hitting, and it is no wonder that the audience praised him and applauded thunderously. There was also a singles match in which Zhang Dingzhao defeated Luo Xiaojian two to zero. In the final doubles match, Xu Lin teamed up to defeat Carlson Shi Guiya without much effort. It rained yesterday morning until noon, so the audience was slightly reduced. Today, starting at 4 pm, Xu will fight Qiu Feihai on the same ground. Judging from yesterday's performance, victory should be easy. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Chengji 4-6 6-3 6-4 Carlson</p>
<p>Zhang Dingzhao 6-2 6-2 Luo Xiaojian</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Lin Baohua 6-2 6-4 Carlson Shi Guiya</p>
<p>Significant Technical Progress</p>
<p>Xu Chengji not only performed wonderfully yesterday, but also his movements and postures were extremely moving. His serve was heavy and powerful, scoring many points. Mistakes are extremely rare. The serve is now very reliable. The cross-court exchanges are deep and extremely far, and the volleying at the net is wonderful everywhere. His backhand is powerful and is the most significant progress. Carlson is not a weak player, but Xu took the upper hand everywhere. He should have won the first set. He should also be able to win against Lin Qiu without a doubt. The current Xu is really not inferior to Japan's Hirai and others.</p>
<p>Carlson Wins the First Set First</p>
<p>Xu first opened the game, winning two consecutive games. The beauty of his sideline shots made Carlson unable to cope. In the next three games, Xu repeatedly tried to attack Carlson's backhand, but as a result, Carlson won instead, exceeding with a score of three to two. Xu's deep and distant cross-court exchanges and heavy serves also won back two games, and he was ahead with a score of four to three. The situation was extremely even, but because of the failure of Xu's service game in the ninth game, Carlson won the first set with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Overcomes Carlson</p>
<p>Xu Chengji was not flustered and was extraordinarily calm. Each won their service game to make the score two to two. Carlson broke Xu's serve and took the lead with a score of three to two. At this time, Xu suddenly saw a boost, and his diagonal cross-court shot was excellent, unmatched for a time. He completed it in one breath, winning four consecutive games and taking back the second set with a score of six to three. In the third set, Xu still had the upper hand, and his momentum was extremely good, four to two and then five to three, which had become a sure victory. He finally won the third set with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>Luo Xiaojian Cannot Defeat Zhang Dingzhao, the appearance of Luo Xiaojian Zhang Dingzhao eased the atmosphere a lot. Zhang Dingzhao's baseline shots and forehand heavy pressure made Luo Xiaojian unable to cope, and Luo's serves were heavy and overlapping, and double faults were uncountable. Only in the second game of the second set was there a fierce battle. As a result, Zhang won with two sets of six to two.</p>
<p>Xu Lin Doubles are a Perfect Match</p>
<p>The Xu Lin pairing in doubles can be called a perfect match. Both of them have fierce volleys and heavy serves. In addition, the opponent Shi Guiya is the weakest of the four. Carlson's efforts alone are of no avail. Lin Baohua even concentrated the ball point and hit Shi Guiya. The first set was six to two, and the second set was six to four, and neither had a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Today's Order</p>
<p>Xu Chengji vs. Qiu Feihai Singles 3 pm</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Carlson vs. Lin Baohua Peng Naweiqu Doubles 4 pm</p>

<h3 id="e146">Finance: Major Players Continue to Aggressively Sell; Bullion Margin Loosens; Briefly Breaking the 900 Yuan Barrier; Finally Rebounding Six Yuan Seven Jiao <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw a loosening of the floor as major players from the previous days continued to sell off significant amounts, with a slightly stronger selling sentiment, making it easier for downstream participants. Major players continued to aggressively sell and also dumped foreign exchange, briefly falling below the 900 yuan mark. The Kuo Hwa Bank came in to buy US dollars, and rumors spread of a certain bank entering the market, sparking a reaction. However, the price ultimately fell due to predictions of a rise in printed silver. In the early morning, overseas silver markets were stable in both the UK and the US, while forward silver prices in Monterrey fell by 0.5 to 1 li. Exchange rates were normal, and the London gold spot price fell by half a penny. Market sentiment had already fallen overnight in the gray market due to Minister Kong's denial of inflation. When pre-market trading opened yesterday morning, it immediately retreated to around ten yuan, and soon fell further to 89 yuan. The shorts slightly covered, rising to 11-12 yuan. However, due to the continued sell-off by major long positions, the situation was difficult to improve. The price broke the ten yuan barrier immediately after opening. The Central Bank's official rate remained unchanged, and the supply surged, causing a downward trend. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy in, resulting in some rebound, but failed to break through the ten yuan barrier. Later, although the HSBC official rate did not change, the domestic market strengthened due to the sale of foreign exchange by Cheng Lan Yong, and the price fell again. At this time, the price remained relatively stable due to the unremitting efforts of HSBC and others. However, it was ultimately unsustainable as Xingye took the opportunity to sell at a high price. After entering, the banks' appetite slowed down slightly, but the selling pressure increased, breaking through the 900 yuan barrier. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Kuo Hwa Bank continued to buy in, and the price soon rebounded. Despite many struggles along the way, the demand from the mainland Kuo Hwa Bank was very strong, the foreign exchange market tightened, and market sentiment reacted, with buying sentiment returning. Rumors spread of a certain bank entering the market, causing the shorts to be squeezed and rush to cover, breaking through the ten yuan mark. The longs continued to supply, and the price of printed silver was predicted to rise by four annas, leading to a decline. However, there was support at the low price. At noon, the market turned sideways, and the overall trend for the first half of the day remained volatile. Major players entered and exited abruptly, causing market sentiment to be uncertain and creating large price swings, making it difficult to predict the future. The market conditions for the first half of the day are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e147">Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Market as Chinese Merchants Sell While Banks Buy <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign cable reports, London's long and short positions were both flat. New York's silver market was unchanged. Forward silver prices in Monterrey decreased by 0.5 to 1 li. London's spot gold price decreased by half a penny. The British pound strengthened against the US dollar by 0.25, while the US dollar remained unchanged against the British pound. The British pound strengthened against the French franc by three pounds, while the US dollar remained unchanged against the French franc. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices, with the British pound at 1 shilling 5 pence 8125 and the US dollar at 16.875 yuan. Compared to the previous closing price, the British pound weakened by 0.0625, while the US dollar strengthened by 0.125. The Central Bank announced its official exchange rate, with the British pound flat and the US dollar strengthened by 0.0625. The customs gold unit price remained unchanged. After the opening, the psychological state of Chinese merchants remained weak, but it was relatively easy to support as banks took advantage of low prices to buy in. Subsequently, when banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices, the Chinese merchants, including large players like Cheng Lan Yong, resisted selling, revealing signs of loosening. However, at this time, since HSBC's official exchange rate remained flat for both the British pound and the US dollar, banks bought in when prices were low, maintaining a certain level of stability. Nevertheless, as Chinese merchants' banks continued to dump, they could not sustain, and the process became increasingly difficult due to a lack of buyers. Later, with banks taking advantage of low prices to buy in and the Kuo Hwa Bank coming in to purchase, the psychological state of Chinese merchants rebounded. Trying to buy in but finding it difficult, they immediately reacted, gradually tightening the market. Finally, the market turned slightly flat due to predictions of a 4-anna increase in the price of silver. The underlying trend was fluctuating. At the closing price, the recent selling price was 1 shilling 5 pence 8125 for the British pound and 36.875 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous closing price, the British pound weakened by 0.0625, while the US dollar strengthened by 0.125. The Chinese merchants' banks had mixed buying and selling, with a slight net selling. While Xingye sold, the mainland Kuo Hwa Bank, HSBC, and Maijia Li bought in. The transactions for the first half of the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>In the morning, the recent selling price for the British pound opened at 1 shilling 5 pence 8125. Holland sold to Youli 5625 for September. Maijia Li bought spot at 875. Datong sold 5625 for September, HSBC bought the same month at 5625 and 625 against the搭. Youli sold 5625 for September to Wah 比. Datong sold 比 to Shanghai, which sold 875 for August to HSBC.

<h3 id="e148">Weekend Finance Increasingly Bleak; Fluctuations of Fractional Currency Unpredictable <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>As early autumn enters its course, in previous years at this time, the import and export of various commercial goods would have generally commenced, and the adjustments and handling of financial procedures would naturally be complicated. However, this year, it is exactly the opposite. Up until now, not only is there no sign of prosperity, but it is even inferior to the peak season. The underlying reason is nothing more than the sluggish market, which cannot be harmonized or activated. Yesterday in the market, foreign exchange remained unchanged. The early and midday rates showed no activity whatsoever. Market prices were generally inactive. Although the Small Exchange Association had a small number of transactions with slightly higher rates, it was just a fleeting moment. In the interbank lending market, early market transfers amounted to over 2.8 million, with no new transactions initiated. Midday market had just 200,000 to 300,000 in transactions, and the Small Exchange Association had 400,000 to 500,000. Due to the scarcity of transactions in foreign exchange collateral loans, no new deals were made, so the amount recovered was also not significant, only over 600,000, while the amount lent out was even less, only over 200,000. The source of customer funds was hindered, with only 50,000 used for settlements. Banknote withdrawals were over 300,000, with over 400,000 in compensation vouchers issued and over 200,000 in circulating vouchers. Money shops cleared over 48.4 million in public foreign exchange bills, over 4.22 million in foreign exchange clearing funds, over 600,000 in remittances from various routes, and over 400,000 in cash clearings. Bank clearings: yesterday was the weekend, so clearings were slightly lower. Foreign banks cleared 1.8 to 1.9 million in bill funds, 2.8 to 2.9 million in various goods and remittance collateral miscellaneous funds, 400,000 to 500,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, over 500,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds, over 600,000 in special remittance funds, and 300,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks cleared 1.3 to 1.4 million in bill funds, 3.3 million in various goods and remittance tax collateral miscellaneous funds, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, over 400,000 in special remittance funds, over 700,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds, and 400,000 in warehouse entries. Japanese banks, due to recent high trade surpluses, had more clearings than others, with over 2.1 million in bill funds, 3.5 to 3.6 million in various goods and Shanghai miscellaneous funds, over 300,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds, over 800,000 in special remittance funds, over 700,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, and 500,000 in warehouse withdrawals. In summary, yesterday's clearings, except for the Japanese banks which seemed somewhat active, the remaining clearings were unusually quiet. Speaking of the Jiangnan small silver dollar, considering the current era of decline, the market naturally has little interest. However, although there is daily market activity, it ultimately feels bland. Even if there are fluctuations of several yuan, they quickly return to the old state. Yesterday's early market was 837 yuan, seemingly 1.5 yuan higher than the previous midday. The midday market then fell back 2 yuan to 835 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous midday. Trading volume: the early market saw 5,000 fractional units traded, while the midday market had no transactions, leaving an empty board. The Guangdong small silver dollar was still 735 yuan in the early market, on par with the previous day's midday market. The midday market was slightly lower by 0.1 yuan, at 734.9 yuan. Trading volume: the early market saw 115,000 fractional units traded, and the midday market saw 40,000. Copper coins added 1,000 cash, totaling 342,500 cash, with 41,100 strings traded, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in silver dollars. Furthermore, the total number of bill exchanges in the city was 14,277,914.75 silver dollars, including a total exchange of 3,700,542.18 silver dollars, remittance transfers of 6,039,272.35 silver dollars, a total collection from the money industry of 2,977,737.73 silver dollars, and other collections of 1,555,662.49 silver dollars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to sudden rumors of Director Wang's resignation, public sentiment suddenly turned soft. Although the "48" account released orders, they were sold in an orderly manner at reduced prices, without excessive selling. However, many people echoed the sentiment, causing market prices to decline. Generally, occasional imbalances in the supply and demand of chips cause market prices to fluctuate. The actions of "48" are significant, and the future situation may not undergo major changes in the short term. The summer suspension of afternoon trading has reached its expiration date, and it may be extended for one or two weeks due to weather conditions, with a decision to be made on Monday. Yesterday, the market initially opened slightly lower, but gradually strengthened due to strong demand from retail investors. This month's unified tax sharply increased by 0.4 yuan, but later weakened, declining by 0.2 yuan after the 22nd pass, with the trend becoming uncertain. In the second session, "48" released some orders, but not necessarily for selling, possibly to facilitate short selling. The price of gold sharply fell by more than 0.6 yuan, and the "96" government bonds no longer had the momentum to continue rising. "48" also sold some orders, weakening the surface sentiment. In summary, most market prices fell by 0.05 to 0.6 yuan, with a few slightly better by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The total trading volume was 8.6 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>According to a new foreign firm report, yesterday (the 9th) in the New York stock market, led by automobile stocks, advanced strongly, with trading volume exceeding 2 million shares. The activity was unprecedented since May 28th. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also created a new high since 1931. Blue-chip stocks, either due to recent dividend increases or exceptionally bright prospects, all set new records for this year or in recent years. Today's transactions were all paid in cash, purely investment-oriented. Small exchange stocks were also active. The bond market was mixed, with public utility and railroad bonds rising. The full-day trading volume was 2.19 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Rumors of Cotton Yarn Receiving, Yarn Market Already Inverted <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise due to rumors circulating in the market about certain aspects of this month's yarn futures, stating that there was a shortage of deliveries, with preparations to receive around 2,000 bales. Another rumor stated that there would be further price increases in August. Therefore, the market rallied. According to another perspective, the short squeeze by all the long positions will likely not materialize. However, most of the industry is in a long position, and any market dryness will increase the upward pressure. Nevertheless, there is still no activity in the spot yarn market. There are 200 bales of new yarn in the warehouse, which have already been unloaded.</p>
<p>This month's yarn is being squeezed higher.</p>
<p>The opening of the cotton yarn market was weak due to flat conditions in the foreign cotton market, but gold prices fluctuated, causing anxiety. There were few buyers in the market, and prices slightly fell by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan for each month. Near the close, it was heard that gold prices had fallen and rebounded, and a certain account in this month was purchasing again, preparing to receive goods, causing the market price to slowly rise. As a result, August and September both increased by 0.1 to 0.7 yuan compared to the previous day's close, with distant months increasing by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a sudden tightening of buying in this month, exciting the market. Rumors began to circulate again. The market still trended upward. However, near the close, prices slightly fell due to long positions being sold off, with prices dropping by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan for three-grade yarns. As a result, this month increased by 0.1 to 0.6 yuan, and distant months increased by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 yuan. It was found that Yida sold 900 bales, Gengfeng sold 1,100 bales, Ruidai sold 750 bales, Renfeng sold 1,200 bales, Yuanyi sold 550 bales, Changfeng sold 1,000 bales, Tonghe sold 650 bales, Dayun sold 400 bales, and Yudai sold 650 bales. Dafu bought 1,400 bales, Tongji bought 1,900 bales, Taichang bought 600 bales, Shengyuan bought 1,200 bales, Yongda bought 850 bales, Xincheng bought 650 bales, Mingde bought 800 bales, Daji bought 500 bales, and Runyong bought 500 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Yarn sales were only over 300 bales.</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. It was found that the total purchases by various groups throughout the day were 340 bales, with the prices similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 20, Shantou 20, Changsha 90, Wuhu 5,</p>
<p>Jiangxi 10, Henan 60, Colleagues 5,</p>
<p>Ningbo 5, Luzhou 5.</p>

<p>The cotton market remains firm, and the bullish sentiment is particularly strong. The bulls are unwilling to sell off the amount absorbed in August, causing the market to be particularly robust, pulling up distant months. As for the increase in American cotton production, the Indian cotton market was greatly shaken. Today's telegram showed a sudden drop of 6.7 rupees. However, Shanghai market speculators are tightly holding large quantities, so the cotton market is unlikely to fall, and rumors of rising prices are circulating.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao near month up, far month flat.</p>
<p>The opening of the cotton market saw Indian cotton down 6.7 rupees, and American cotton showing mixed ups and downs. Market sentiment was flat. However, the August contract bulls were unwilling to let go of their positions. Near the second and third sessions, the standard gold price broke the 900 yuan mark, causing the market price to slightly fall. However, near the close, the cotton yarn price rose, attracting more buyers, and the gold price returned outside the 900 yuan mark. As a result, prices for all months increased by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening followed the yarn market and rose, with a particularly strong increase in the second and third sessions. However, near the close, prices fell again as bulls sold off. As a result, this month fell by 0.1 yuan compared to the morning close, and distant months fell by 0.05 yuan. It was found that Dafu sold 4,100 dan, Hexing sold 2,300 dan, Ruidai sold 3,800 dan, and Yuanxingchang sold 3,000 dan. Yiyu bought 1,100 dan, Yudai bought 1,300 dan, Daji bought 1,700 dan, Yuanyi bought 3,400 dan, Yongda bought 4,300 dan, Tongji bought 1,400 dan, Xincheng bought 1,700 dan, and Mingde bought 1,400 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton sales are difficult to increase.</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption remains weak, with factories sluggish. Inbound cotton is estimated at 550 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e153">American Cotton Only Has Swap Transactions; Loan Issue Temporarily Expected to Fail <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a fall of 0.03 to 0.05 "suiyin" for each month. After the opening, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, brokers sold off, and the market price fell again as the weather continued to be favorable. However, demand from colleagues was very strong, and most of it was absorbed. Subsequently, short positions covered, and the government bought July, sold December to May, and spot merchants bought October and December, selling January. There was no report on the loan issue. It is generally believed that the market price will not sharply fall, and the loan will not be established. Later, long positions were liquidated, softening the market price. However, due to reports of excessive heat in the central and western regions, it rebounded again. Hyslop estimated this week's mill consumption at 158,000 bales. Liverpool stock was 174,000. Futures prices fell 0.01 to 0.05 pounds. English spot cotton fell 15 points, and futures fell 0.05 to 0.10 cents. Indian cotton initially weakened due to futures traders selling, but rebounded due to the firmness of July and August contracts, and European exporters covering short positions. Finally, it fell again due to speculative long positions selling, with "Pingguo'er" falling 4.25 rupees, "Aomula" falling 5 rupees, and "Bailuoxi" falling 6 to 7.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 9th).</p>

<h3 id="e154">Grains: Wheat Flour Market Universally Optimistic Inside and Out <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat flour market was stable in both near and far months. The price of imported wheat from Chicago was better by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Canadian wheat fluctuated. Market sentiment was stable due to the slight increase in imported wheat. Currently, spot imported wheat is temporarily inactive due to the low exchange rate, so sentiment has stabilized. Furthermore, the current demand for spot flour in Tianjin is quite active, so sentiment inside and outside the industry has become aligned again. However, domestic credit remains tight, and strength has not been restored, with little speculative activity. Therefore, while the situation is good, it is not easy to overstimulate. As a result, this month was better by 0.0075 yuan, September to December increased by 0.01 yuan, January increased by 0.0025 yuan, March increased by 0.01, and January increased by 0.0075 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Wheat Scarcity Trend Is Promising, Standard Market Rebounds <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed stable signs for each month after opening in the morning, because imported wheat was slightly better by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The domestic trend of spot wheat has become tight again. Due to the lack of coordination with foreign ports, the number of arrivals became increasingly scarce. It was heard that yesterday's source from various routes shipped about 1,800 bags, so there seemed to be more than enough stability for the inventory in the city, even if customers did not seek the best price. As a result, August was better by 0.02 yuan, September was better by 0.1 yuan, October was better by 0.04 yuan, and November was better by 0.03 yuan. The spot wheat market has also stabilized. Various grades shouted for 0.03 yuan more. Shandong wheat opened at 3.75 yuan, Daqiao wheat at 3.7 yuan, Gaoyou Dongtai Jiangyan wheat at 3.64 yuan, Wuhe wheat at 3.6 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 3.63 yuan, Baoying wheat at 3.62 yuan, Hankou wheat at 3.44 yuan, and Qingjiang wheat at 3.65 yuan, with Fuxin taking 3,000 bags and Fufeng taking 2,000 bags, similar to Zhonghua taking 500 bags.</p>

<h3 id="e156">New Ningbo Rice Continues to Arrive <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The rice market initially saw new Ningbo rice continue to arrive, with high-quality goods but prices similar to the previous market. A total of 143 bags arrived, priced at 9 yuan, 8.85 yuan, and then 8.73 yuan, all handled by this street. The rice market was therefore relatively flat. However, cargo owners believe that costs are high, and they are unwilling to sell at low prices. The appetite in this city remains strong, and merchants from Quanzhou, the northern ports, and the interior are all accommodating. The prices can still hold. The whole city opened with 1,800 bags of Saigon rice, 1,350 bags of "small pattern" rice, and approximately 2,000 of "Dangsu" and "Digao". The prices were similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of rice (South Shanghai) suddenly arrived from various groups for more than 10 shipments, (with a total of more than 8,000 "shi"), and the market situation felt more decadent, with the sales yard becoming increasingly inactive and settlements continuing to cease. Transactions on this street were also slightly lower. Most goods are unable to be sold, and the sales side once called for lower prices, but to no avail. Its momentum is quiet, and the market color is particularly low. As a result, the prices of various thick "Jing" varieties all saw another decrease of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. For the market going forward, unless there is continued heavy rain and a scarcity of arrivals, causing the demand for settlements to increase, there may be a turning point. East [unclear] continues to rely on the rain to stabilize. [Unclear] is generally flat due to the scarcity of goods. "Du Yangjian" has been out of stock for a long time and has seen recent arrivals, which is quite healthy, so the market price has become independent.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 40 to 50 shipments arrived from various river ports. The sales of various goods in the market, including "Bai Jing" and "Tian Gong Yin", were unstable. Only a few shops listed their goods, resulting in clear sales. The market fluctuates by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. "Zao Bo" [Early thin] continued to arrive in small batches, and sales were stagnant, with prices cut by 0.1 yuan. "Dong Xin Jing" [East New "Jing"] had few arrivals but active sales, so the price remained fixed. "Bai Yuan" [White Yuan] still had sluggish and small sales, and the price fell by 0.1 yuan. A new "Zao Jian" [Early Sharp] from Jiashan arrived today with ten "shi", and its quality is better than last year, with a price opening at 9.1 yuan. The prices of other goods varied slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Oil Market: Sesame Oil Sold at 680 <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The sesame oil market has recently improved. Yesterday, Runde Company in the bean market street sold [unclear] German goods at 680 dan, with a price of 17 yuan, and it was handled by this street. The price was 1 yuan higher than the previous market. Due to the rising production price of crude oil, market sentiment has strengthened. Recent arrivals have been scarce, and the city has a small accumulation of chips, so cargo owners are firm in their intention to sell, and the market is active. If sales continue steadily, the market situation will be difficult to assess from now on.</p>

<h3 id="e158">The Ten Demands of Children <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>The enthusiastic and great Children's Year has begun. The society and the nation will seek tangible happiness and infinite benefits for children across the country. Children are naturally excited, joyful, hopeful, and grateful. Taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the author, on behalf of children nationwide, presents ten demands for their lives:</p>
<p>First, there must be well-stocked children's libraries. -- Living in a complex society, we suffer from a knowledge famine and cannot develop; with a lack of learning, we are bound to be eliminated. Children's libraries are where we absorb knowledge and study. Dear society and nation, give us well-stocked children's libraries, quickly.</p>
<p>Second, there must be spacious children's playgrounds. -- Living in bustling cities, we are surrounded by dense populations and polluted air; our bodies are tired, and our spirits are stressed. Children's playgrounds are where we can rest our bodies and comfort our spirits. Dear society and nation, give us spacious children's playgrounds, quickly.</p>
<p>Third, there must be complete children's museums. -- School facilities may not be complete; knowledge on paper may not be correct. The objects displayed in children's museums can be observed, verified, and can provide practical knowledge at any time. Dear society and nation, give us complete children's museums, quickly.</p>
<p>Fourth, there must be suitable children's sports fields. -- To improve health, we must emphasize exercise; to develop physique, we must emphasize training. The equipment in children's sports fields can be used for us to learn, compete, and strengthen our muscles and bones at any time. Dear society and nation, give us suitable children's sports fields, quickly.</p>
<p>Fifth, there must be ordinary children's zoos. -- In the study of natural science, we must observe real objects to study various animals to create a deep impression. Therefore, there must be children's zoos, raising various birds, beasts, insects, and fish, for us to observe their forms, study their habits, and experiment with breeding methods. Dear society and nation, give us ordinary children's zoos, quickly.</p>
<p>Sixth, there must be scenic children's botanical gardens. -- In the study of natural science, we must also observe real objects to study various plants to avoid confusing concepts. Therefore, there must be children's botanical gardens, planting various beautiful flowers, exotic grasses, precious trees, and strange plants, for us to appreciate their forms, study their functions, and experiment with cultivation methods. Dear society and nation, give us scenic children's botanical gardens, quickly.</p>
<p>Seventh, there must be simple children's art museums. -- Art is the cultural crystallization of humanity. Art museums dedicated to our appreciation, displaying ordinary works, are enough to arouse a love of beauty, and artistic thoughts. Dear society and nation, give us simple children's art museums, quickly.</p>
<p>Eighth, there must be noble children's cinemas. -- Movies are ordinary leisure entertainment. Cinemas dedicated to our viewing, showing educational films, are enough to enhance the development of knowledge and interest in life. Dear society and nation, give us noble children's cinemas, quickly.</p>
<p>Ninth, there must be legitimate children's drama societies. -- Drama is an active art that can stir emotions and entertain the mind. Our drama societies, through our own activities, rehearse stories or songs and dances for children to watch. Dear society and nation, give us legitimate children's drama societies, quickly.</p>
<p>Tenth, there must be universal children's broadcasting groups. -- Broadcasting is an emerging art that can impart knowledge and report current events. Our broadcasting groups, allow us to work ourselves, broadcasting songs or speeches for children to listen to. Dear society and nation, give us universal children's broadcasting groups, quickly.</p>
<p>If these ten demands can be fully realized within this year, and if they are to be universal across the country and enjoyed by all, not limited to one area or class, then that will not betray the nation's intention in establishing Children's Year; that will truly be seeking tangible happiness and infinite benefits for us. Naturally, we must also strive to cultivate our character, improve our knowledge and abilities, and strengthen our physique, so that we can all become capable citizens who repay society and the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Story of Yu the Great Taming the Floods (History) <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>The Yangtze River and the Yellow River have simultaneously experienced major floods, with breaches and submergences in various places. Unfortunate news continues to come from newspapers. Thus, the issue of flood prevention and disaster relief has become the most urgent issue at present. Speaking of flood prevention and disaster relief, we are reminded of the story of Yu the Great taming the floods more than 4,000 years ago, which I will introduce to the children:</p>
<p>During the time of Emperor Yao, floods plagued various places. The floodwaters were extremely vast, even submerging hills and mountains, not to mention the plains. People lived in nests in trees or climbed high mountains, suffering from hunger and cold, and leading extremely difficult lives. Thus, Emperor Yao ordered Gun to tame the floods. He built dikes to defend against the floods, but the floodwaters were fierce, and the dikes could not withstand them, breaking as soon as they were built. So, after nine years of governance, the floods in China still could not be quelled. During the time of Emperor Shun, Gun was killed, and his son Yu was ordered to continue his father's duties and tame the floods again. Yu knew that his father's method of building dikes to resist the water was wrong, so he changed to a method of dredging and guiding the water, dredging the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, the Huai River, and the Han River, making them flow into the sea. He waded through water, climbed mountains, and travelled east and west, never taking a moment to rest. He passed his home three times in eight years without entering. Because he was so dedicated to taming the floods, the disaster of the floods was finally quelled.</p>

<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of Children's Year was held on August 1st in various places. How lively! How happy! However, in the newspapers of that day, we saw a tragic piece of news: A primary school teacher named Xu in the north, because he had lung disease, actually bought a child from a poor family and cooked him alive to eat.</p>
<p>Children, I am reporting this matter to you so that you know: (1) On the one hand, people are holding Children's Year, shouting "seek happiness for the children," while on the other hand, someone is taking a child to cook alive. This society is full of "contradictions." (2) As a primary school teacher, one should have a certain amount of knowledge; however, he actually thought that eating a child could cure lung disease. Medical knowledge is lacking to such an extent! If primary school teachers are like this, there is no need to mention the many people who have never read books. From this, we can know that most people in this society are still very "stupid." (3) In order to cure his own illness, he cooked someone else's child alive; people like this who only care about themselves and do not care about others are definitely not just one person, and incidents of this kind of heartlessness are definitely not just one. From this, we can know that many people in this society are "selfish" and "cruel." (4) Parents would never be willing to sell their own children to others unless it was absolutely necessary, let alone have them cooked alive. From this, we can know that the lives of many of our people are already "poor" to the extreme.</p>
<p>We are young and powerless children, born into a society full of contradictions, where the four fierce demons of "stupidity," "selfishness," "cruelty," and "poverty" are harming us at any time and in any place; but who is our savior?</p>
<p>We must unite, organize ourselves, and work together with the adults who are engaged in children's work to do the following: (1) help children in disaster areas, (2) help poor children, (3) establish labor nurseries, orphanages, and educational institutions, (4) participate in literacy campaigns, and instill common sense in the people.</p>
<p>Children, we live in this hellish society, we must awaken the adults to save the children, and we must awaken the children to save themselves!</p>

<h3 id="e162">Ice Cream and Thermoses (Common Sense) <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Junpeng</p>
<p>Hey! Little friends who have eaten ice cream! Do you know how ice cream is made? Perhaps not! Let me tell you, roughly, ice and salt are mixed in a ratio of two to one and placed outside a mixture of milk, eggs, and other ingredients. At this point, as the ice melts into water and the salt dissolves into the water, both absorb a considerable amount of heat. As a result, the surrounding temperature drops to minus twenty-two degrees Celsius, thus freezing the milk and other ingredients into a solid – ice cream. It is because ice melts into water, absorbing a large amount of heat, that the melting of ice can create a quite low temperature. The cause is based on this principle.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to Shanghai for fun and bought some ice cream, which I put in a thermos to bring back. When I got home and poured it out, the ice cream hadn't melted at all. Little friends, do you know why? Let me first explain how a thermos keeps the water inside warm. A thermos is a double-walled glass bottle with the air evacuated from between the walls, and the inner and outer surfaces of the double walls are silver-plated. The reason is that glass is a poor conductor, sufficient to prevent conduction; evacuating the air between the walls is sufficient to prevent conduction and convection; and silver-plating the inner and outer surfaces is sufficient to prevent heat from escaping and cold air from entering. Therefore, putting cold ice cream inside can prevent external heat from entering and internal cold air from escaping. If you don't believe it, you can try it. Little friends who live in the countryside can follow my method, take it home for your families to taste the flavor of ice cream, and at the same time, gain a lot of common sense.</p>

<p>— Chong</p>
<p>Little friends! Now I am going to introduce you to making a toy, which is the airplane necessary for national defense. Making this kind of airplane is very fun. It can fly in the sky and move on the ground. If you don't believe it, you might as well try making it according to the instructions below, or make it with your classmates. Make one each, and hold a "flying competition" to see whose flies faster. Isn't that very interesting?</p>
<p>Tools and materials: Several sections of bamboo poles, iron wire (lead wire can also be used as a substitute), a small square lead sheet, about half a square inch, two rubber bands (rubber bands), three feet of thread, wheels from old toys, silk (sold in large stationery stores). Scissors, a small knife, an eraser, a pen, ink, an inkstone, etc. Once these are prepared, then start making it. When making it, first, be careful; second, make sure that it is not heavier on one side than the other. With these two conditions, you won't have to worry about it not succeeding.</p>
<p>Method: According to Figure A, use bamboo to carve the leaves that rotate on the nose of the plane. Figure B is also carved from bamboo to make two wings. Figure C; you need to make two of these, for the fuselage. Figure D; is for the crossbar at the tail of the fuselage, with two eye bolts installed on it (sold in hardware stores, buy the smallest ones). Figure E; is a border made of thin iron wire, with thin silk pasted on it, and the two wings behind the fuselage are made in the same way as Figure E. Figure F; is what it looks like after it is assembled. Figure G; is what the nose looks like. Figure H; is what the tail looks like. At its very end, use wire to connect it to the rear crossbar to serve as a rear wheel.</p>
<p>Dimensions, as indicated in the diagram, or you can enlarge or reduce them as you like. However, if you enlarge it, you must enlarge everything proportionally; you cannot enlarge the fuselage and not enlarge the wings. That won't be successful. If you want to reduce it, do the opposite.</p>
<p>How to play: First, wind the rubber band tightly, and don't let it loosen. Then place it on a smooth floor, and when you release your hand, it will walk on the ground. If you want to make it fly, you can also do that. First, complete the steps above, then take it to the balcony on the second floor and toss it into the air, and it will fly forward.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Spiritual Food for Children's Year <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Cong</p>
<p>— Introduced to Adults and Children —</p>
<p>Children's Year is not a year for promotion, but a year for concrete work implementation. To implement work, both adults and children first need to strengthen their own strength. With a healthy body, strong will, correct thinking, scientific mind, hardworking hands, rich knowledge... only in this way can we shoulder heavy responsibilities. It's like asking a person who is starving and on the verge of death to participate in a race, which is simply a joke. The current children and adults, no matter how healthy they are, are only superficially so. Spiritual poverty is undeniable. Now, at the opening of Children's Year, I sincerely raise this question for everyone and introduce several kinds of food that can enrich our spirit.</p>
<p>How to implement general education and science education in Children's Year? What kind of books and newspapers should children read? How to guide children to study science? Opinions on today's elementary school textbooks? How should children's books, newspapers, and periodicals be edited? How should children's newspapers be founded? How can children's physical health be improved? How can their lives be improved? How should general vagrant children be handled? All children's issues need to be thoroughly researched and understood in Children's Year. The Chinese Children's Cultural Association has engaged more than forty specialists and spent five months preparing a 150,000-word book, "Children of Today," which will be sold by Living Bookstore and published on August 25th. If you pre-order now, you will get a special discount. In today's poor economic climate, I dare to recommend it to readers.</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago, Mr. Ye Shaojun's "The Scarecrow" opened up a new path for Chinese fairy tales, but afterwards, this path was buried by the weeds of kings and princesses. The Japanese writer Kenji Miyazawa once said: "New children must be given new works, which are constantly thriving and growing in the ever-changing new world." I think the same is true in our country. Looking at the children's books currently published in China, there are indeed many in quantity, but they are too weak in quality.</p>
<p>Several Soviet fairy tales have been introduced to China before. Recently, the Translation Society has published another fairy tale, "The Clock." This is worthy of recommendation to the new children. Mr. Lu Xun said two things in the preface: first, to introduce such brand-new fairy tales to Chinese children, parents, teachers, and educators, and fairy tale writers for reference. Second, he wanted to use simple words for children around ten years old to read. We are so grateful for Mr. Lu Xun's enthusiasm. I dare say that this is an excellent gift for children that is very suitable for Children's Year.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that all adults who care about children can have the opportunity to read this book.</p>
<p>Please pay attention, little friends:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese Children's Cultural Association will broadcast on Xinxin Radio (frequency 780) from 12:00 to 1:00 today, with children from Aihua Primary School singing. Mr. Du Yemou will talk about the story of "The Newspaper Boy." Mr. He Gongchao will report on children's news. Also, "Children of Today," edited by the association, has been sent to print and is priced at six cents. Pre-orders will receive a 20% discount (pre-order period ends on August 20). (2) The first issue of the "Children's Literature" magazine is scheduled to be published today, the 20th. The content is exceptionally exciting, and it contains many works by children. The annual subscription for 24 issues, including postage, is only one dollar. If you subscribe before publication, you don't have to pay in advance, and you will receive two collections of illustrated stories and short detective stories. This is excellent children's reading material. You can send a letter to the society at No. 44-46, Fengyuan Lane, Tangshan Road to pre-order.</p>
<p>Children's Novel</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Little Drummer Boy (II) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>The little drummer boy ran upstairs after him and entered a dilapidated top floor room. He saw the Major holding paper and a pencil, leaning against the window sill, with a long rope on the floor beside him.</p>
<p>The Major folded the paper, fixed his cold, gray-brown eyes on the little drummer boy's face, and suddenly said, "Drummer!"</p>
<p>The little drummer boy raised his hand to the brim of his hat and saluted.</p>
<p>The Major said: "Are you brave?"</p>
<p>The little drummer boy's eyes brightened, and he replied: "Yes, Major!"</p>
<p>The Major walked with him to the window and said: "Look down there, near the Faranga Villa, there are many bayonets glittering on the ground. That's our military camp. Take this paper, climb down the window with this rope, dash across the small mountain like lightning, run across the field, and deliver this paper to the first officer you meet in our military camp. Now, take off your belt and backpack."</p>
<p>The little drummer boy took off his belt and backpack and hid the paper in the pocket in his chest; the sergeant threw the rope out of the window sill and held the end of the rope tightly; the Major helped the little drummer boy climb out of the window, his back facing the field.</p>
<p>The Major said: "Be careful, the salvation of the first detachment here depends entirely on your courage and your two legs."</p>
<p>"Major, please trust me," the little drummer boy replied. And he slid down the rope.</p>
<p>The Major held the rope tightly and said: "When you land, you have to crouch low on the ground."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, there's nothing to be afraid of."</p>
<p>"May God help you!"</p>
<p>Before long, the little drummer boy had reached the ground. The sergeant retracted the rope and immediately walked away, while the Major stood by the small window, watching the little drummer boy run down the small mountain. He hoped that he would not be seen by the enemy, but soon five or six small puffs of smoke rose from the ground. He knew that the boy had been discovered by the Austrian soldiers, who were firing down from the top of the mountain. The puffs of smoke were the sand and soil kicked up by the bullets hitting the ground. But the little drummer boy ignored everything and ran forward desperately. After a while, the Major cried out: "Oh no, he's dead!" But before his cry was over, he saw the little drummer boy had gotten up.</p>
<p>The Major couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief and said, "Ah, he just fell!"</p>
<p>The little drummer boy was still running forward, but he was limping uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"He sprained his foot," the Major muttered.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Disaster Relief and Disaster Prevention <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Jenny</p>
<p>This newspaper's Nanjing special dispatch on the 5th: "The Capital Women's Disaster Relief Association telegraphed to Chengdu and Qingdao, to the wives of Chiang and Wang, stating that the water disasters in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Fujian were severe. The Association initiated a disaster relief association on the 5th and respectfully requests them to serve as initiators, and to solicit relief funds immediately to help the disaster victims. They also requested to be informed of everything by telegram. The Association also issued a declaration, asking women from all over the country to advocate together... and, if necessary, send personnel to the disaster areas to investigate the disaster situation in various places."</p>
<p>At this moment, when the cry of "Women Go Home" is sung to the clouds, it is indeed a joyous thing that the women of the capital can still take care of matters outside the home and initiate a disaster relief association. However, we believe that rather than saying "send personnel to the disaster areas to investigate if necessary," it would be better to definitively request the wives of important party and state figures to personally lead the wives and grandmothers leisurely enjoying life in their comfortable mansions to visit the disaster areas. They should know that the wives and grandmothers of the upper class are pampered and do not know the suffering of the world. This can make them aware that the hell on earth is just a short distance away. Perhaps this will allow them to save a little money from leisure and decoration expenses and save a few disaster victims gasping for breath in the flood!</p>
<p>Secondly, disaster relief is indeed the urgent task at present, but it is ultimately passive. The active thing is that everyone can recognize the root cause of this disaster. Especially the women's community, most of whom are superstitious, think that this is the victims' bad luck, and hold prayer meetings and disaster relief ceremonies. These not only cannot eliminate disasters, but are just a waste of life and money.</p>
<p>We know that droughts and floods are indeed natural disasters, but they can be eliminated by human effort. The reason why we do not have this kind of power to fight against natural disasters now is due to the weakness of our country and the unsoundness of the political and social system. Therefore, if we want to eliminate natural disasters forever, we must first strengthen the subjective strength of our society.</p>
<h3 id="e168">"Dispute Over Separate Schools for Boys and Girls in Beiping" <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Since the country has been gradually declining over the past few years, the issue of public morality has become louder and louder. Everyone knows that "public morality" cannot directly make people feel that it is a work of saving the country, like "aviation"; however, various places cannot help but make a fuss about it. When it gets exciting, it even spreads from "lowly" prostitutes and wandering singers to so-called "innocent" female students; many people are hoarse and exhausted from making a fuss about this, and their energy has found a place to be used.</p>
<p>Beiping is the most gloomy place, and there are many "generous people with sorrowful songs from Yan and Zhao" and people who have lost their homes in the Northeast. It is not easy to restrain their anger that wants to reach the stars! But now, the old well is stirring, and Mayor Yuan's insistence on separate schools for boys and girls in middle school has caused storms in the city, making people forget the situation of living in a precarious nest. It is true that the female students in the business, normal, and vocational departments who are merged into the general department will suffer losses, but after all, it is a small matter for "women". As long as it is convenient for the big things, the small things cannot be taken care of too much.</p>
<p>Moreover, doing things must adapt to the environment. The whole of China is like this, let alone Beiping? What is the use of those female students in Beiping who have specialized knowledge and skills, or higher scientific knowledge and higher world knowledge? Sooner or later, they will have to return to the corner of the house to learn "filial piety"! The horizontal line that men's education has already stepped on cannot be changed for a while, but women are easy to deal with. If you tell her to move out, she has to. After moving out, it doesn't matter whether you study in a women's school that promotes the doctrine of virtuous wives and good mothers or not. There are not many female students in the three northeastern provinces, and there are no middle schools with both male and female students; so there are very few girls who join their rebellions everywhere.</p>
<p>If the country wants to stretch its neck and see the light of day, then men and women can receive the same education in all kinds of knowledge and skills, and society can have more talents in various fields, which may be a help. But as I said just now: Beiping is the most cloudy place, and it is best for everyone to shrink their necks a little lower to show that it is a prosperous age. This matter should not be truly and frankly promoted, but should be done step by step: it is easier and more appropriate to start with the weaker female world. With a cry, the female students were told to return to the dim, restricted, and simple newly established girls' schools, and they had no choice but to obey. Using the reason that preventing adultery is better than preventing ..., many people also felt that "this is right!" Promotion is ultimately the work of great men with a few more tricks.</p>
<p>However, the representatives of private middle schools in Beiping are still holding meetings to strive to maintain "Beiping's inherent educational achievements." This seems to be just a matter of school prosperity, so what they are fighting for is just the school authorities. But, in reality, it is a crisis of women's education and a great threat to the women's community. After many years of hard struggle, they finally managed to knock on the door of men's schools and let women squeeze in, allowing them to hear more serious things besides being confined to being virtuous wives and good mothers, tailors and cooks; but now, under the false pretense of preventing suspicion, they are determined to make women retreat. If the matter in Beiping can still be regarded as a "national matter," it should be the women of the whole country and the men who want to see the light of day who should rise up and fight for it.</p>
<p>Now, it is only the middle school authorities of male and female students in Beiping who are rising up to fight for it, which is obviously turning a big matter into a small matter; and a small matter can be turned into nothing in the future. The separate schools for men and women in middle schools in Beiping will become a certainty. The situation of us shrinking our necks can be seen from Beiping and other places: Thus, dark clouds will lock the whole country, locking the women and men of the whole country.</p>

<p>— Luo Qiong</p>
<p>Since the end of the 19th century, Abyssinia has been reduced to a semi-colony under the competition of Britain, France, and Italy. At present, it is the same as other semi-colonies, and has a tendency to gradually move from a semi-colony to a colony. Italy is the promoter of this trend. Now the Italian-Ethiopian dispute has reached a tense situation, and Ethiopia is unwilling to submit, and Italy is determined to use force to the end; the outbreak of war seems to be only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Since the dispute arose last winter, Ethiopia initially hoped for the League of Nations' fair judgment and the sanctions of the Non-Aggression Pact. However, the United States has stated that it does not want to interfere, and Britain and France are again seeking their own interests and cannot jointly maintain the credibility of the League of Nations. Under the control of this international situation, the Ethiopian authorities have only two paths to take: first, to surrender to Italy and accept all of Italy's demands unconditionally. The second is to prepare for a heroic national liberation war at any cost. The recent speeches of the Ethiopian King and the foreign statements of Ethiopian diplomats all indicate the determination to "rather die on the battlefield than lose an inch of land," which shows that Abyssinia is taking the second path.</p>
<p>In this war frenzy, the attitude of Ethiopian women is particularly noteworthy. According to the Havas dispatch of July 28th, "The Ethiopian Women's Assistance Army Committee held a meeting in the Ethiopian capital this afternoon, with the participation of military leaders, and resolved to organize groups to care for sick and wounded soldiers during wartime." Reuter's dispatch on the 30th of the same month stated that Ethiopian women are preparing to replace men's duties when men go to war. Ethiopian women can resolutely participate in the national war at this time of deepening national crisis; this is a good example for women in semi-colonies to follow.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the Ethiopian authorities take the aforementioned first path, then under the humiliating "good neighbor" diplomacy, it is inevitable that a retrograde "women go home" movement will be generated, that is, using household labor to trap women and paralyze their fighting consciousness. Not only does it hinder the liberation of women, but it sometimes indirectly helps imperialism, allowing it to smoothly carry out its aggression policy. However, the Ethiopian government is now taking the second path, and Ethiopian women have also bravely embarked on this second path. This is something we should learn from and admire!</p>

<h3 id="e171">Lecture 8: Women in the Age of Imperialism <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>Section 1: World War and Women</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution began at the end of the 18th century, for about a century, the world's capitalism, although occasionally encountering inevitable panics, generally saw a smooth upward development. The completion of industrial organization, the development of production technology, and the control of commodity and labor markets all demonstrated the highly developed form of capitalism. This led to the so-called imperialist era, the "final stage of capitalism."</p>
<p>However, European advanced countries, since the 15th century, had successively seized colonies as commodity markets in various parts of the world, and by this era, they had to re-divide them. As a result, the inherent contradictions of capitalism became increasingly acute. The economic protagonist of the century, Britain, and the emerging Germany engaged in a heated battle for market share. The economic competition developed into an arms race, leading to the unprecedented World War.</p>
<p>What was the result of the war? Ten million dead, twenty million wounded, and a total military expenditure of 400 billion yuan! For five whole years, the people of Europe struggled in poisonous gas and a sea of blood! In past history, this was the most brutal page!</p>
<p>However, merely listing these alarming numbers is not enough to express the true tragedy of the war. The truly painful tragedy, rather than being played out on the battlefield, was played out in the rear. Because the soldiers who rushed to the front lines, under the beautiful name of "dying for the motherland is glorious," even if they died from bullets, it was only a moment of pain. As for the mothers, wives, sons, and daughters of those soldiers in the rear, from the life-and-death separation at the time of departure to the receipt of the death notice, how many heartbreaking tears were shed, and how many illusory dreams were made! Living in the unbearable grief of wanting to cry but having no tears, what did "the glory of the motherland" have to do with them! What they wanted was the return of their husband or son! However, this was only a desperate fantasy! A long-term tragedy!</p>
<p>Clearly, this unprecedented bloody tragedy was something that the big capitalists of various countries urged their governments to launch in order to obtain commodity markets and more profits, but they also raised the banner of "for the motherland, for justice," encouraging soldiers to rush to the front lines as cannon fodder! Encouraging women to stay in the rear to maintain order! Of course, "patriotism is the highest justice"! Whoever dares to oppose this "justice" is a traitor! However, countless poor soldiers became sacrifices under the banners of "justice" and "patriotism"! The cruelty of the World War lies in this!</p>
<p>War not only robbed women of their husbands and sons, but also destroyed their livelihood – the family! In ordinary times, the husband or son was their economic "supporter" and the "master" of the family. But at this time, they became orphans and widows with nowhere to turn! Many proletarian women, in order to prolong this miserable life, had to find a way to survive! They either participated in the military-controlled munitions industry, doing unlimited labor in manufacturing killing tools, in order to barely survive, or they became prostitutes accompanying the army, or even joined bandit dens or revolutionary ranks.</p>
<p>Originally, capitalist governments in various countries, in order to indirectly boost the morale of soldiers on the front lines, raised the issue of guaranteeing the lives of their family members. That is, they stipulated that the wives, widows, and orphans of soldiers should be given monetary subsidies or other preferential treatment such as free accommodation. But these were "empty promises." Although women participating in work in the rear could support their own lives, the lives of their children and elderly relatives could not be maintained. Therefore, the infant mortality rate increased sharply during the war. In this way, the war not only robbed them of their husbands, but also robbed them of their children.</p>
<p>In this situation, women had no choice but to become reactionary elements of society. In the spring of 1915, working women in Berlin rose up to welcome revolutionary leaders Karl Liebknecht, attacking the Scheidemann government, and at the same time carried out anti-government demonstrations. Women in the warring countries raised strong protests against soaring prices and the cruel war. In 1916, women in Paris repeatedly destroyed markets and looted coal warehouses. In June 1916, women in Austria rebelled for "three days" to oppose the war and rising prices. In Italy, when the declaration of war began mobilization, women, unwilling to send their husbands and sons to the death line, formed human barricades with their bodies on the railway tracks to prevent the train from proceeding. The rebellion in Russia from St. Petersburg to Moscow, even spreading to various places in April 1915, was initiated by the wives of soldiers. In particular, the uprising of working women in St. Petersburg on March 8, 1917, became the fuse of the Russian Revolution. When capitalist governments preached "patriotism" to them, their reply was "We want to seize bread for our children"!</p>
<p>In this way, women experienced miserable lives in the Great War and resolutely opposed the war! But twenty years later, the so-called Second World War is inevitable and upon us! Judging from the general situation, this time the battlefield is likely to be in the Pacific Ocean, and China will naturally bear the brunt! It is said that this war will be more cruel and more extensive than the previous one! How should we women cope with this terrible tragedy of great destruction? This is a major issue to be seriously considered.</p>

<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The snow was falling heavily, and the ground was already more than an inch thick. Many footprints were deeply imprinted on the same road. Beggars, in groups of three or four or four or five, walked back and forth, and the sound of "sisha, sisha" often came from the snow. Xiu Zhen carried a dirty pair of pants to the riverbank to wash. The river surface was covered with long, wide windows and heavy wooden cabinets. She looked up at the opposite bank. The black lacquered gate was wide open, and the workers were still carrying them out piece by piece and throwing them into the river. She carefully looked at it, whose home was that? Over the years, she had forgotten a bit. In the past, although the gate was black, it was not as newly black as it was now. On the roof, the tiles had been arranged neatly, the walls had been painted snow-white, and several bungalows had been added next to the house. But other than this house, there were no better houses. Either they were older and more dilapidated, or they had collapsed into ruins. The thatched shed at the foot of the mountain was left with only a few beams, lying there crookedly.</p>
<p>Xiu Zhen had just finished washing her pants and stood up when the sons of the Taigong carried a basket of white rice to wash. They brushed past her, almost knocking her down. She knew that the rice was for making New Year cakes, and she recalled the taste of New Year cakes. She also heard the sound of pounding New Year cakes next door, which aroused her appetite even more. She couldn't help but turned a corner and glanced at the snow-white, soft glutinous rice cakes that had just been steamed and were being pounded in the mortar in the Taigong's house.</p>
<p>Xiu Zhen, covered in snowflakes, entered the house. Before she could step inside, she saw her sister-in-law breastfeeding her young nephew. Her eldest nephew walked up to his mother and cried for something to eat. Her sister-in-law glanced at Xiu Zhen and loudly scolded her son:</p>
<p>"Little devil! You're coming over again! What do I have to give you to eat? I only have myself! You want to eat, 'you, big and small, might as well eat me up!'" The eldest nephew cried and shouted, and his sister-in-law scolded even more fiercely, giving him a severe beating and then throwing the child out into the snow outside the door. The northwest wind was blowing wildly, and the snow was falling harder, sprinkling on the face and body of the eldest nephew, who was stuck in the snow, like the tip of a mustard green peeking out of the garden.</p>
<p>Xiu Zhen stood there like a wooden chicken. At this time, her mother came back with a sheng of millet. When she saw her grandson lying in the snow, she quickly picked him up and brought him in. The millet was scattered all over the ground in the panic. She supported the child, picking up the rice one grain at a time, muttering:</p>
<p>"Being so impatient, even if you want to hit the child, you can only gently slap his buttocks a few times to scare him; you can't throw him in the snow like that! If the child gets sick from the cold, won't you be anxious again?"</p>
<p>After all, he was her own son. Her sister-in-law took a towel to wipe away the tears and snow from her eldest son.</p>
<p>"Isn't it true, what you scatter, you reap." The mother said.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law got angry, and she immediately twitched her lips:</p>
<p>"I want to hit him, I want to love him, he's my own son, who dares to talk to me? You know how to raise children, you know how to teach children, why didn't you raise a good son?"</p>
<p>"Where did I raise a bad son! Look! I want to ask you!"</p>
<p>"Not bringing back a single penny, not even a letter, this is your son! Such a son, is that what you raised?" The sister-in-law said, taking a step with each sentence, pointing her finger at her mother's nose.</p>
<p>"My son is like this, it's not my fault, it's your bad luck! Why isn't your luck a little better? Then your husband would earn money for you to use."</p>
<p>"It's my fault? You old hag's bad luck has covered up your son's good luck. It's your old life that's bad!"</p>
<p>The mother was so angry that she couldn't say a word, her lips trembling, her hands stretched out, wanting to tear her daughter-in-law's mouth, if Xiu Zhen hadn't stepped forward to dissuade her, they would have almost started a fight. If they had started a fight, of course, the mother would have suffered.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law's anger had not subsided, and she continued to scold:</p>

<p>(Question)</p>
<p>(1) My grandparents gave birth to my father and my uncle. They separated long ago. My grandfather died early. My grandmother is still healthy. My parents have no children, so they adopted me as their daughter because I am his niece and have blood relations. They plan to give me all the property and inheritance rights. Is this legally permissible? What kind of procedures should be followed?</p>
<p>(2) My uncle also had no children. My uncle also died. He adopted a nephew to inherit for both him and his wife. He had already given the customary "filial piety" payments. But after my aunt dies, can the remaining property belong to me?</p>
<p>(3) My grandmother also mentioned the property for living expenses. Because she is old, her livelihood is entirely provided by my family, and she has agreed to give me all of her possessions. What procedures should be followed?</p>
<p>(4) The reason why my parents did not adopt a nephew as their son is because their knowledge is very limited and, moreover, they are from a distant clan. If my parents die, and they want to argue, how should I resist? (Asked by Pin Fang)</p>
<p>(Answer)</p>
<p>(1) If the lady has been adopted by her aunt and uncle since childhood, or if a contract was signed at the time of adoption, then when the inheritance begins in the future, she can inherit the adoptive parents' estate according to law, without the need for other procedures.</p>
<p>(2) No.</p>
<p>(3) This is an act of donation. A donation occurs when one party expresses the intention to give his own property to the other party without compensation, and the donation becomes effective upon acceptance by the other party (see Article 406 of the Civil Code). However, if the donation involves property that cannot be transferred without registration (such as the transfer of real estate rights, which must be registered before it can be asserted against a third party), the donation does not take effect until the transfer registration has been completed (see Article 407 of the same law). Since the intentions expressed between the donor (your grandmother) and the donee (the lady) are consistent, in addition to paying attention to real estate registration, the donation is effective. It is also acceptable to draw up a written document if desired.</p>
<p>(4) The current law abolishes patriarchal inheritance. Unless the lady's adoptive parents voluntarily adopt a son from a distant clan, in the future, the son from a distant clan cannot claim inheritance based on patriarchal succession. If disputes arise in the future, the lady can defend herself according to the law.</p>

<h3 id="e174">The Issue of the Existence of Rickshaws <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yong</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Shanghai Public Concession had a plan to improve municipal transportation, saying that it would gradually reduce the number of rickshaws in stages within a few years, first reducing them by a few tens of percent, gradually making them disappear, to facilitate traffic, reduce city noise, and increase people's happiness. The reverse of reducing rickshaws is to promote the use of automobiles, using machines instead of human labor. If one day, we are fortunate enough to be able to climb to the position of the automobile class, it will truly be a feeling of "what good fortune for the common people to be born in a prosperous age"!</p>
<p>In the 20th century, advocating science and using machines, of course, no one with a brain would disagree. Using the fruits of science is to increase the happiness of life, which is an easy theorem to prove, and we also hope that there will be such a day when all the happiness derived from the science girl can be commonly enjoyed by the general public. For example, take electricity, not only can wealthy families install electric lights and radios, but also in slums and remote areas there is brilliant electric light flickering and pleasant music permeating, making the entire space bright and surrounding the entire earth with songs of happiness. Similarly, we also hope that one day everyone will have a Ford car. Not only will they no longer have to labor their jade toes, but they will also be able to save time. Let us imagine how happy this world will be!</p>
<p>Therefore, in this regard, the good intentions of the Public Concession authorities are worthy of gratitude. But the science girl always has an arrogant temper and snobbish eyes. She will only lower her voice and serve obediently among princes, nobles, and ladies. When she encounters poor people, not only is it impossible to get close to her, but she is often subjected to her meanness and bullying. When a 1936 Ford car whizzes past in front of us, the scientific happiness we enjoy is a nose full of dust and smoke. For example, in my hometown, when villagers want to go to the city, they originally relied on rickshaws costing four cents per trip. One year, a gasoline boat company was opened, completely seizing all the rickshaw business. Rickshaw pullers, faced with hunger and cold, sold their human power as cheaply as machine power. That is to say, the fare for taking a gasoline boat was two cents, and the rickshaw was also only two cents. In this way, under the rickshaw pullers' desperate struggle against the machine, they were able to temporarily survive by relying on the leftovers of science. However, most of the rickshaw pullers were finally squeezed into the ranks of the unemployed.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that many tragedies will inevitably occur on the road from human power to science, but what methods will we use to avoid the cruelty of science? This is a problem worth studying.</p>
<p>The large number of rickshaws in Shanghai does hinder traffic, and the noisy city sounds do annoy the noble people in the ten-mile foreign concession. However, we have to think about why there are so many rickshaws? Why are rickshaw pullers willing to do this most laborious and lowly life like cattle and horses? Here, we encounter a serious social problem. Economic panic, industrial and commercial decline, and increased unemployment are a series of facts that we cannot close our eyes and simply dismiss. We support advocating science, so we also support abolishing rickshaws (but not like some philanthropists who do not sit in rickshaws for humanitarian reasons), but at the same time, we firmly advocate that in order to abolish rickshaws, the livelihood problems of tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers and their families should be properly and even fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>Not long after the Public Concession announced its new policy plan, the French Concession registered rickshaws, and an alarming tragedy occurred in which dozens of rickshaw pullers were injured when they were arrested beyond the boundary. Is it really impossible for the fate of rickshaw pullers to escape the cruel slaughter of science? Alas!</p>
<p>The Confession of a Professional Woman</p>

<p>— Miss Bai Hong Speaks</p>
<p>When I was a child, I loved to hum songs in a babbling voice. Therefore, being immersed in singing and dancing all day long as I am now, I find it to be a career that suits my personality quite well, although I haven't achieved much in singing and dancing.</p>
<p>I remember starting to step into the realm of singing and dancing in the spring of six years ago, when I was just thirteen years old. Generally speaking, a girl of that age would never have the opportunity to leave her family to pursue her hobbies. However, unexpectedly, I did so, and even broke free from the old family with its very strong feudal consciousness. This can truly be considered a miracle in my short life history, no wonder I still don't want to forget it!</p>
<p>In these six long years, I haven't fully learned everything I wanted to learn, which is a bit of a disappointment. However, I have since embarked on a journey of self-sufficiency in life, which is somewhat comforting.</p>
<p>Speaking of my family situation, I simply don't want to think about it, although they don't have any ill feelings towards me. Therefore, since I came to Shanghai, the impression of my family seems to have gradually faded away with the passing of time. Now I only remember that I am a banner-man belonging to the Plain Yellow Banner (a branch of the Manchu Qing imperial family). Relying on the military achievements of our ancestors in conquering the Han people, our branch was able to enjoy the preferential treatment of aristocratic life. However, I don't know from which generation of ancestors we moved from the vast deserts of Mongolian yurts to Peiping (Beijing).</p>
<p>It is said that at that time, the life of a group of imperial relatives—including my family, of course—was very decadent and boring. They were simply idle all day long, or rather, they had nothing to do. They only pursued their individual hobbies: strolling through the hutongs (alleys), raising birds, cockfighting, horse racing. The older ones would grow flowers at home, play chess, or invite two or three peers to tea houses to enjoy tea and wine, or go to bookstores to listen to storytellers or to opera houses to listen to operas. Endless time was spent on these activities until they died. However, subsequent generations would still inherit the legacy of their ancestors and continue their efforts. Thus, until the end of the Qing Dynasty, their way of life only changed somewhat with the ruthless environment.</p>
<p>My father was also a typical figure among these imperial relatives, with a mind full of feudal consciousness.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Everything new, in his eyes, was as terrible as floods and fierce beasts. Although he didn't prevent me from entering the world of singing and dancing, this was only because an unfortunate fate dominated his consciousness. Otherwise, perhaps I would still be "living in seclusion in the boudoir"! However, the success of a thing sometimes requires the coincidence of objective circumstances. For example, if our family hadn't "declined," my father's thinking would never have changed. Furthermore, without my mother's encouragement, he would never have been willing to put down his dignified face and voluntarily let me engage in singing and dancing. Moreover, if the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe hadn't traveled to Peiping at that time, even if I wanted to engage in singing and dancing, I would have "no way to enter."</p>
<p>In Peiping, those who registered to join the Bright Moon Troupe at the same time as me included Li Mingjian and Ying Yin. Except for Ying Yin, who was a bit older, the rest were girls of eleven or twelve years old. Now Ying Yin has left the Bright Moon Troupe and has her own future, but Li Mingjian and I continue to be together, loving each other. We both believe that singing and dancing is a lifelong career, and hope that the Bright Moon Troupe can be carried forward and developed by us, if it doesn't encounter unexpected setbacks. After we, a group of children, joined in Peiping, we soon followed this "circus-like" group and left Peiping for Qingdao. We performed once in Qingdao, where I made my "virgin" debut. However, because it wasn't an important role, it didn't attract people's attention at the time. After staying in Qingdao for a short time, this large group of people marched grandly to Shanghai. From that time on, we began a period of learning on the right track.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jinhui placed great hope on us new members who joined in Peiping. Therefore, he personally taught almost all the dances. When teaching members to learn singing and dancing, his attitude was very strict, putting on the face of a moralist, like a private tutor supervising the members to practice their lessons. Xu Lai, the first female member of the Bright Moon Troupe, was able to enjoy such a great reputation in the modern film industry because she was greatly influenced by him. He paid attention to the members' lives as if they were his own children. He recognized Li Mingjian as his goddaughter because he was afraid that she would feel lonely and uncomfortable in her life.</p>
<p>The first step of my lesson when I first entered the Bright Moon Troupe was to learn simple singing. I hummed all day long, and no one forbade me from doing so. Six months later, I began to learn basic dance steps. The instructor—Mr. Jinhui—always watched by the side, and if there was anything wrong, he would come forward to correct it, and he would also make some gestures himself. This lesson seemed a little more difficult than singing at the time. The reason was that I was used to singing in school, but I didn't have many opportunities to learn dancing. Therefore, when I came here to start learning dancing, my steps naturally seemed stiff. In addition, the instructor supervised me closely, which further increased the panic of my movements. After suffering for several days—at least, that's what I thought at the time—the surrounding environment seemed different. Everything became familiar, and the feeling of timidity disappeared. From then on, whenever a new dance came out, I would understand it as soon as I was instructed once or twice.</p>
<p>Cultivating a new talent is similar to a stonemason carving a utensil. The craftsman must have advanced skills to express his art, but the material must also be able to withstand the craftsman's carving. Learning singing and dancing is like that. It seems easy and shallow, but it's not easy to teach or learn. I have been learning here for more than a year, but I still dare not believe how much I have learned, although I am already studying acting skills and opera theory.</p>
<p>The Bright Moon Troupe was led by Mr. Li before, and he is still leading it now. However, now there are several more instructors, such as Mr. Li Jinguang, so the internal organization and management are more scientific than before. However, what's worth mentioning here is that the finances of the troupe are public, and the life is disciplined. The members should fulfill their pure obligations to the troupe, and at the same time have absolute rights. For example, we were taught by Mr. Li, and now we must fulfill the same obligations to the members who joined later, because in this way, the troupe can reduce the expense of hiring teachers. Now there are more than thirty new and old members here, and the monthly regular expenses are several hundred yuan. Our group is not a capital combination, and it has no economic background. To maintain the growth of this group, we can only rely on everyone's income from external performances to subsidize the troupe's expenses. Therefore, we only have life here, not remuneration. The members' food and accommodation are provided by the troupe, and the money transferred by the members—such as the income from radio broadcasting—is also counted as the troupe's income. If there is a little surplus in monthly expenses, everyone can share the money. For example, last time at the New Light performance of "Peanuts," each person got more than three yuan.</p>
<p>Our life as members here is a bit like a military life—no, it's simply military discipline. Isn't that right? In times of national crisis, soldiers sometimes have no pay to take and have to fight on the battlefield. When the singing scene is silent, we are the same. We have no money to take and still have to work hard for singing and dancing. Getting up at five o'clock in the morning to practice singing is not the same as soldiers getting up at dawn to drill? We practice from five o'clock to eight o'clock before eating breakfast. We have classes from nine o'clock until twelve o'clock for lunch, with only half an hour of rest in between. In the afternoon, we "cook in the same way" from one o'clock to five o'clock. At nine o'clock in the evening, the lights are turned off, and we get a longer rest. However, those who have to broadcast on the radio are an exception.</p>
<p>My life experience is not very rich, so if I want to say something, it seems that there is nothing worth saying. However, in the six years that I have stepped into the world of singing and dancing, I have followed the Bright Moon Troupe to Nanjing, Hankou, Qingdao, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places for performances, living a nomadic life. I have received many good criticisms, and I have also been subjected to many sarcastic satires. These personal slanders are what a person engaged in art should encounter, and it is not worth worrying about. However, the Chinese singing and dancing scene has struggled for more than ten years, and it can only attract the attention of three or four critics (?), which makes me feel inexplicably disappointed! Like last time when we performed at the New Light Theater, those critics who claimed to be the vanguard of the times said that we were acting like clowns, using this superficial perspective to interpret singing and dancing, it really makes us in the singing and dancing scene want to cry out loud!</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Naval Question in Europe <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Cheng</p>
<p>Germany's declaration to rearm not only makes France and Italy feel uneasy, but even Britain, which is known as the king of the seas, feels that the situation is not good. Because, as it stands, the result of Germany's rearmament is that its air force will inevitably surpass Britain's, which goes without saying. At the same time, even Britain's traditional so-called two-power standard will be in danger of not being preserved. Therefore, after Germany declared its rearmament, Britain had to think more about the naval question and quickly come up with appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>Originally, since the Napoleonic Wars, Britain, which had mastered the world's hegemony, had adopted the two-power standard at the end of the nineteenth century, that is, Britain must maintain the naval power jointly possessed by the two largest naval powers in the world. In April 1898, Germany engaged in major naval construction, and then greatly expanded it. By 1909, Germany's naval power was almost equal to Britain's. At that time, Baldwin, the leader of the British Conservative Party in opposition, said in Parliament that the British Navy had long lost its two-power standard qualification. Immediately, Britain abandoned the two-power standard and recognized the 16:10 British-German naval ratio. This was the first blow that the British Navy's two-power standard encountered. Later, as a result of the World War, the German Navy was completely destroyed, and Britain celebrated its long-term consolidation of its maritime hegemony. But unfortunately, American power developed during the war, and it actively expanded its navy with its huge financial resources, causing Britain to feel the pain of being unable to compete with it. So, at the Washington Conference, Britain finally recognized the condition of equal British and American navies. But in Europe, Britain still maintained the two-power standard, that is, Britain still had the naval power jointly possessed by the two largest naval powers in Europe, France and Italy. Now that Germany has declared its rearmament, it will inevitably continue to compete with the major powers in expanding its armaments. Seeing this, in order to preserve its two-power standard in Europe, Britain quickly conducted naval negotiations with Germany, and the result was the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.</p>
<p>The Anglo-German Naval Agreement stipulates that the German Navy will always maintain 35% of the British Navy's power. In this way, Germany has actually abolished the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles and obtained the right to rearm. At the same time, Britain has also obtained a ratio that will always give it an advantage over Germany in naval matters, and it has maintained the balance of power between France, Germany, and Italy, that is, it has maintained the British Navy's two-power standard in Europe. Therefore, when the news of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement came out, London and Berlin both unanimously proclaimed the victory of their policies. But France and Italy were not very happy about this. Politicians in Paris unanimously declared that the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was a violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the London Declaration of March 2nd. This atmosphere of opposition to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is still maintained today.</p>
<p>The Washington Conference also decided that the French and Italian naval ratio to the British and American should be 35%. Although the French actively opposed this decision, the combined naval power of France and Italy has still failed to exceed that of Britain. Currently, France's naval power is 560,000 tons, while Italy's is only 370,000 tons. According to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, the total tonnage of the German Navy can only be more than 150,000 tons. But after the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was established, the German Navy could increase to 420,000 tons, and it could immediately build 300,000 tons of new-style warships. In this way, Germany's naval power would be equal to France's. Compared to Italy, it has a great advantage. From this, it can be seen that France and Italy's opposition to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement has a major reason. Judging from the current situation, the naval question in Europe will cause more disputes due to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. In this dispute, the major powers will inevitably compete to expand their navies and enter the most dangerous situation. In fact, France and Italy have formally stated that they will not necessarily abide by the 35% ratio to Britain and the United States stipulated in the Washington Treaty. The trend of the major powers competing to expand their navies has already been clearly revealed.</p>
<p>At the same time, although France and Italy have a certain degree of consensus on opposing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, they still have major conflicts on the naval question. In fact, Italy insists on the view that the French and Italian navies should be equal. The reason is that Italy has a larger population than France, its coastline is also longer than France's, and its important metropolises are all close to the coast, so a strong navy is needed to defend them. At the same time, France can transport the iron, coal, oil, and other materials it needs by land, while Italy must rely on overseas supply, so Italy's navy must be equal to France's. However, in France's view, France is the second largest country in the world with vast colonies, and its country is also adjacent to the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea. All coastal areas are in danger of being attacked by enemy fleets. Moreover, in the event of an emergency, France must also recruit black troops from Africa. Therefore, France resolutely opposes the French and Italian navies being equal. In the past, at the Washington Conference, there were many disputes over the question of French and Italian naval equality. This dispute is still continuing, and in the upcoming disarmament conference and naval conference, this question of equality will also be one of the problems that cannot be solved.</p>
<p>At the time of the Washington Conference, the main disputes in Europe were only between Britain, France, and Italy. Germany was not yet prepared to rearm at that time. In the disputes over the naval question in Europe, Germany can be said to have been an outsider. But just the many disputes between Britain, France, and Italy were enough to give European politicians a headache. As already mentioned, Britain's so-called two-power standard, Italy's claim to be equal to France, and France's anti-British and anti-Italian views are in conflict with each other. It is in this mutual conflict that European politicians have exhausted their efforts and schemed against each other, but they have not been able to solve the naval question in Europe at all. They have only made the disputes more and more numerous and the situation more and more serious! Now, Germany has resolutely declared its rearmament, and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement has been established. Needless to say, Germany will inevitably become one of the main disputants in the European naval question in the future, and the problem will become more complex and more serious, which we can also assert.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Before the Watchtower <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Han</p>
<p>A good moon—just showing half its face in the east, and the earth already felt brighter. Her beautiful, clear gaze shifted to the north of the chimney, looking askance at the Zhangde railway station; everything there, moving, still, joyful, sorrowful, was all reflected in her eyes.</p>
<p>Well-fed and well-clothed people, in their own courtyards and on the watchtowers, arranged incense, flowers, and fruits to welcome the New Year, a time for new clothes. In an instant, the lights and candles shone brightly, and firecrackers resounded through the sky, thus completing the welcoming ceremony. A moment later, the scene changed again: on a vermilion round table were displayed fresh tea and snacks, and a sumptuous feast was spread out. At the family's peaceful gathering, the adults were very relaxed, and the children's faces were filled with boundless joy. As they raised their glasses to the bright moon, they felt that life was beautiful and the family was sweet. But under the same bright moonlight, in the same atmosphere of joy, another tragedy was about to unfold.</p>
<p>Next to the platform, there was a small inn—Fatty's Inn. Half a month ago, a young couple came, their names on the register were: "Li Er, Wang Liujie." They were not merchants, officials, nor wandering vagabonds. Their actions were vulgar, and their speech was full of rustic flavor. After checking in, they had no relatives visiting, no friends to look after them. In this bustling world, they were all alone!</p>
<p>Over the past ten days or so, Liujie always wore a sorrowful face, huddled in the pigeon coop-like side room, quietly shedding tears and sighing softly! Li Er seemed to be avoiding a disaster, leaving the inn early every day, sometimes not returning wearily until dusk. Today, he left early again, and his shadow is still nowhere to be seen!</p>
<p>Liujie sat alone on the wooden bed, staring blankly with dull eyes at the dim kerosene lamp. She seemed to be in a daze, or perhaps she had lost consciousness. When the sound of firecrackers outside entered the secluded side room, she finally seemed to come to her senses and turned her head. In an instant, firecrackers went off one after another, as if unable to restrain emotional impulses. She hysterically went to the door and lifted the bamboo curtain to look out. At this moment, the moonlight was exceptionally bright, and there was not a single cloud in the sky. It was truly a beautiful night. Later, the sound of firecrackers gradually became hoarse, monotonous, and finally faded away with two or one crack at a time.</p>
<p>The earth was quiet, with only the children's songs in the distance causing a slight ripple in the still air. But the song seemed contagious, and soon the nearby children joined in, so that every word and every line was clearly transmitted into Liujie's ears:</p>
<p>"The moon is bright, the moon is round,</p>
<p>The whole family gathers around.</p>
<p>Little sister eats mooncakes,</p>
<p>Little brother learns to play finger-guessing games.</p>
<p>Poor Aunt Wang next door,</p>
<p>Her husband left and never returned!"</p>
<p>This ordinary song, this childish, nonsense song, actually stirred Liujie's heartstrings, evoking her memories of tragic past events.</p>
<p>She remembered that before the Lunar New Year, due to the pressure of rent and debts, and the scourge of life, she finally had to sever the love between mother and child. She exchanged her own five-year-old son, Xiao Niu Zi, for fifty silver dollars from Widow Sun! After paying the rent and debts, there were still twenty dollars left. The couple held this sorrowful sum and still toiled in the fields, playing with mud in the starlight and moonlight. Sometimes they looked at the Guan Wang deity statue covered with dust on the wall, hoping that the god of the fields would give them a better harvest, hoping that the land would repay all their losses. However, as time turned to May and June of this year, the heavens did not send a drop of rain to the ground. The wheat ears were withering, and the corn was turning yellow. The couple's blood and sweat were still in vain, and all hope</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>disappeared like bubbles. When it came time to pay the rent in July, there was no harvest in the fields, and no food left in the house. The money from selling the son was already spent, and there were no more sons to sell! But what about Zhang the landlord's rent and the couple's future life? In the end, they had no choice but to flee their ancestral home and run to Zhangde, hundreds of miles away...</p>
<p>The tragic past was already tightly bound to Liujie's heart. Moreover, during this Mid-Autumn Festival, seeing the reunions of other families and hearing the lively songs of other children, further stirred up her feelings of longing for her son and her home. She could not help but feel sore all over and collapsed softly on the bed.</p>
<p>As she was about to drift into a dream in a daze, the door panel suddenly creaked open. She raised her head alertly and realized it was her husband. She struggled to move her stiff body and went to his side: "Why are you back so late?"</p>
<p>He did not answer, but sat wearily on the lame stool. His melancholy face and abnormal expression greatly surprised her.</p>
<p>"How was today?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Li Er said, forcing himself to remain calm, and then took out four mooncakes from his pocket, handing three to her, "Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival..." His voice was very choked and finally stopped.</p>
<p>Liujie held the mooncakes, as if losing consciousness, staring blankly at her husband, without saying a word.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Li Er gently walked to Liujie's side, put his left hand on her shoulder, and pressed his right hand against his chest.</p>
<p>"Liujie, we, husband and wife..." He sobbed nervously, his moist eyes emitting a terrifying light.</p>
<p>Liujie stood up abruptly and asked in surprise, "What's wrong? What's wrong with you today..."</p>
<p>Li Er hesitated for a while and finally said painfully, "Liujie, I'm leaving tonight..." He took out a paper package from his pocket, "These three dollars, keep them safe."</p>
<p>"Where to..."</p>
<p>"Baoding. —Today I ran to the mine and waited all day, but still no hope. Several people were laid off the day before yesterday, and I think there's no point in waiting any longer." Li Er took a long breath, "I thought, sooner or later I'll die anyway, so on the way back I ran into recruiters, and I signed up..."</p>
<p>"Are you really going? I..." Liujie suddenly cried out "Wah" and tightly gripped his collar with both hands.</p>
<p>Li Er was at a loss, tearing off a piece of his ragged shirt to wipe her tears, while tears were also rolling down his own face: "Don't cry! What can we do? Are we just going to starve to death! Think about it, we've been here in Zhangde for almost twenty days, looking for work every day, at the coal mines, flour mills, and cargo yards, we've waited everywhere. But..."</p>
<p>Liujie was now a little more sober, thinking that her husband's words were indeed correct: when the two of them fled to Zhangde, they thought that there were railways, coal mines, and flour mills here, and as long as they were not lazy, they would definitely find work; who knew that one day, two days, until now, they were still both idle; seeing that their clothes were all sold, and they owed a lot of money to the inn, were they really going to starve to death together? Thinking of this, she sympathized with him and forgave him. But he was leaving so simply, leaving her behind, how would she end up? So she felt very sad again and burst into tears: "You're leaving, but I... what will happen to me...?"</p>
<p>Li Er's attitude was very awkward, and he felt as if countless needles were pricking his heart. After a long, long time, he burst out with a painful voice: "You?... I've already discussed it with Old Fatty, he can take care of you..."</p>
<p>Liujie had just opened her mouth when a strange call suddenly rang out outside the door: "Li Er." Immediately, the door curtain was lifted, and a man in military uniform appeared. He glanced at Liujie and then said to Li Er, "The '72' train leaves at 12:15, make sure to be there."</p>
<p>"Yes." Li Er responded mechanically.</p>
<p>Immediately, there was a burst of miserable crying in the room!</p>
<p>The hands of the clock at the station were about to point to "XII". A round, bright moon hung in the center of the sky; there was not a trace of dust in the universe, and all the secrets on the earth were exposed in the clear waves of light. At this moment, a man and a woman were standing at the entrance of Fatty's Inn; in the cold moonlight, the man's face was particularly pale, and his whole body was trembling as if in spasm. The woman leaned slightly on him, as if she had lost consciousness, her face was green, and her body was limp. They stood like this for five minutes. The bell at the station rang, and the whistle emitted its first cry. The man suddenly became alert, suddenly pushing the woman away. His mouth opened and closed, and his chest rose and fell, as if he wanted to speak, or as if he was breathing. His eyes stared sluggishly at her, not knowing whether it was love or hate. At this moment, a middle-aged fatty stood at the low doorway, his hands on his hips, his head swaying, as if he was watching something interesting. The man suddenly turned to the fatty and said pleadingly, "Boss, please take good care of her, don't sell her..."</p>
<p>"Don't worry." The fatty's voice was unusually gentle, "Go, go quickly!"</p>
<p>"Woo! Woo!..." The train let out a long, mournful cry, and all that could be seen at the station was people crowding around. The man suddenly hugged the woman and spat out a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Liujie..." He choked with sobs and could not utter a word, only looking at the round moon in the sky with both eyes.</p>
<p>"Ding-dong, ding-dong!" The last bell was ringing at the station. He suddenly broke free from the woman's hands and ran madly towards the station. She staggered after him, but fell to the ground with a "wah" after only three steps!</p>
<p>At this moment, someone on the watchtower of the coal mine company opposite was enjoying the moon with a prostitute. Amidst the excited music, a girl hummed a line from Pinggui Biedong: "It made us... husband and wife... part..."</p>

<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Correspondence from Santos, Brazil</p>
<p>Brazil is a country in South America that is rich in resources and vast in area. England, the United States, and other countries have huge investments here. Therefore, although Brazil is still nominally an independent country, in reality, its politics and economy are dominated by England, the United States, and other countries. There are four kinds of residents here: the Indians who lived here before Columbus discovered America, the Europeans who migrated later, the African blacks who were imported by the Europeans as labor, and the mixed-blood hybrids. Now, except for the uncivilized Indians living in remote areas, these different races are unified under one government, one language, and one religion (Brazil is a Catholic country). Therefore, it is very difficult to clearly point out its unique national character; however, if you pay attention to observation, you can see the customs and human sentiments of the so-called Brazilians in many places.</p>
<p>First of all, it is worth noting the Brazilians' hospitality towards their guests and visitors. If you visit Brazilians, they will make every effort to find out what you like, and then try their best to make you feel comfortable and happy in all aspects. A Frenchman who had been to South America once said: "We were very welcomed in Argentina, Chile, and Peru, but the treatment we received in Brazil was better than anywhere else, it was just like being in our own home."</p>
<p>Brazilians are very passionate. Not only in the love between men and women, but also in the friendship between general same-sex friends, their passionate emotional expressions are somewhat unusual. In Brazil, if two friends who have been separated for two weeks meet again, the surprise and cordiality they express emotionally will exceed that of friends in other places who have been separated for ten years; they will not only shake hands enthusiastically, but also hug and cheer. In the streets here, you can often see two men embracing each other frantically, but they are just ordinary friends who have only been separated for two weeks, not people with deep relationships who have not seen each other for many years. Someone said, "The character of Brazilians is gentle and kind, but also terrifyingly rough": this is indeed a fair comment in some respects.</p>
<p>Brazilians also love Brazil's natural beauty and undeveloped resources: the first Brazilians are eager for their country to develop day by day, to use their own strength to develop its resources, and to make their country occupy a superior position in the world. But—under the control of the political and economic forces of England, the United States, and other countries, their hopes will not become a reality unless there is a major change in the fundamentals. In recent years, due to the stimulation of objective facts, some more progressive Brazilians have also seen this point, so they have gradually become less "hospitable" to England, the United States, and other countries.</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, because Brazil is rich in special products and easy to live in, the general temperament of Brazilians is more lazy and lacks the will to work hard, struggle, and make progress. The average Brazilian always postpones things that can be done today until tomorrow or even the day after tomorrow. There are few great achievers in Brazil, and the main reason is of course that Brazil's culture is backward, and that the aggression of British, American, and other imperialisms has hindered its development, but the lazy bad habits of its people are also related.</p>
<p>Compared to its vast land, Brazil is a sparsely populated country. However, due to the development of capitalism, there are also very large cities in Brazil, and their degree of prosperity is no less than that of cities in Europe and the United States. Rio de Janeiro has a population of two million, and Sao Paulo also has a population of more than one million. In such large cities, as in large cities in Europe and the United States, there are radio broadcasts, large airships flying in the sky, more than thirty-story Western-style buildings, groups of cars, movies, music, and of course, modern men and women, as well as Pekingese dogs.</p>
<p>Driving north from Sao Paulo, after a while, the urban atmosphere of Brazil disappears: on both sides of the car are vast coffee plantations; the houses that appear in front of you are not modern buildings of more than thirty stories, but crude bungalows; there are many cattle-herding men on the grasslands, most of whom have dozens of cows around them. Once you arrive at the station, it's even more interesting. Here you can see many mixed-race, half-black girls riding on mules and horses, specially to greet their husbands; when she gets off the mule and horse and receives her husband who is coming down from the train, she must embrace him in a passionate and long embrace as if she were crazy. When the train stops or starts in such places, it does not sound the whistle as a signal, but rings a bell: when the bell rings for the train to stop and the train stops at a station, in addition to coming down one after another to watch the scenery of these places, many passengers will take the opportunity to drink a cup of extremely black and strong coffee.</p>
<p>If you go from a large city in Brazil to the countryside, you will be surprised to feel that you have arrived in another world. Because the countryside here not only lacks tall buildings, and not only is the material equipment very different from the cities, but also the social relations and living conditions are one or two centuries behind the cities. The villagers in Brazil mainly grow coffee in the countryside, but the owners of the coffee lands are feudal-era lords. Therefore, although Brazil's cities have been modernized, its countryside is still stuck in the feudal era. In such a rural area, of course, the feudal landlords dominate everything, and so-called law and justice have no meaning here, and the general public does not know these things; all that is recognized is the authority of God and the feudal landlords.</p>
<p>Brazilians like to dance, and they start dancing whenever they are tired from farming. Sometimes they play pleasant music and dance wildly. They are even more happy when foreigners go there to play music. During the dance, the women here often love to drape the beautiful fabrics they get from the Turks over their heads and dance wildly with the young men, sometimes even indulging in dancing all night without sleeping, until dawn, when the parrots sing and the cows moo, then they end their frenzied dancing.</p>
<p>Gambling and alcohol are also particularly loved by Brazilians. Whether on the streets or in general squares, you can see Brazilians gambling; in addition, there are many large casinos here, and their architecture and facilities are very luxurious. As for their love of alcohol, it is proportional to their love of gambling. They can go a day without eating bread, but they cannot go a day without drinking alcohol. The alcohol they drink is mostly a strong shochu made from sugarcane, which seems somewhat inconsistent with their warm temperament, but in fact it is so. However, the good thing about Brazilians who like alcohol is that they are different from American, Russian, and even Chinese drunkards. After they get drunk, they quietly go to sleep, without causing trouble, without looking for someone to fight, without shouting and making noise in the streets, and without going crazy.</p>
<p>The Brazilian government also runs lotteries. There are generally two types: one is a small lottery once a week; spending one or two yuan to buy a lottery ticket gives you the hope of winning ten thousand or twenty thousand yuan; the other is an annual lottery, buying a lottery ticket for one hundred yuan gives you the hope of winning six or seven hundred thousand yuan. Brazilians' love of buying lottery tickets is no less than their love of gambling and drinking. Almost every Brazilian is a regular buyer of lottery tickets. Whether they are going out for a walk, meeting friends, or drinking coffee, Brazilians will not forget to buy a lottery ticket to take home.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Overseas Chinese in the World (6) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>During the mid-Ming Dynasty, the Spanish occupied the Philippines. Subsequently, they greatly oppressed the overseas Chinese in the Philippines. In 1603, a conflict in Manila between Chinese and Spaniards resulted in the deaths of as many as 23,000 Chinese. In 1638, the Spanish killed another 33,000 overseas Chinese. In 1660, after Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) took Taiwan, overseas Chinese seized the opportunity to revolt. After the failure of the revolt, almost all were brutally massacred by the Spanish. When the Philippines came under American control, the American government strictly prohibited Chinese laborers from coming to the Philippines. Therefore, although China and the Philippines have deep ties, the number of overseas Chinese in the Philippines is not as large as in Siam (Thailand) and Vietnam. If not for the failure of the Philippine revolution against Spain in the early 19th century, when the Spanish devoted all their efforts to suppressing the Filipinos, allowing the Chinese to take the opportunity to come to the Philippines in droves, perhaps there would be no Chinese presence in the Philippines at all. But even today, the total number of overseas Chinese in the Philippines is only around 100,000.</p>
<p>However, overseas Chinese in the Philippines hold a significant position in industry and commerce. Industries such as cocoa, tobacco, ramie, coconuts, timber, textiles, and sugar are all deeply connected with overseas Chinese. According to an American government survey, there are thirty-one rice mills in central Luzon, of which twenty-eight are operated by overseas Chinese. Among the many Chinese merchants, we can name two of the most famous: Xu Gongping and Ye Tieke. The former trades in rice, hemp, and other commodities, owns ships, and has branches in major cities, with insurance, shipping, and banking departments within the company. The latter is an overseas Chinese who started as a worker. His Ye Tieke Company also mainly deals in agricultural products, with three large warehouses in Manila and six branches in other locations. Branches are also established in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Xiamen, Zhenjiang, Ningbo, and other places, with shipping, insurance, and banking departments internally as well. This not only shows the grand scale of the businesses run by Xu and Ye, but also how important a position overseas Chinese hold in the industry and commerce of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines are also very active in cultural and educational undertakings. Here, there are not only many Chinese-run daily newspapers, but also various publications. In Manila, there are many schools established by overseas Chinese, and they are well-managed, so Chinese schools in various parts of Southeast Asia use them as models.</p>
<p>However, since the European War, overseas Chinese in the Philippines have suffered greatly from the maltreatment of the American government. For example, the shipping companies are prohibited from Chinese investment, rice prices are restricted, and the compulsory implementation of the European and American accounting regulations are all ruthless attacks on overseas Chinese. Recently, the Filipinos' call for "The Philippines for Filipinos" and the open rejection of overseas Chinese, coupled with the fierce competition from ×× people, have dealt a major blow to overseas Chinese in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies, also known as the Dutch East Indies, is located in Southeast Asia, northwest of Australia, and is formed by a group of islands. Among the islands are five main islands: Java, Madura, Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes, and New Guinea. Besides these five major islands, there are many smaller islands, such as the Lesser Sunda Islands and the Moluccas. In total, the Dutch East Indies has an area of two million square kilometers, accounting for about half of all of Europe (excluding European Russia).</p>
<p>The time when Chinese people came to the Dutch East Indies was probably around the same time they arrived in other parts of Southeast Asia. However, the development of overseas Chinese here became more prominent after the Dutch occupied the East Indies in the early 17th century. Although the East Indies have abundant natural resources, their inhabitants are primitive and uncivilized. They are ignorant and stubborn, unable to develop the natural resources. Therefore, after the Dutch arrived, in order to develop the natural resources, they devised ways to attract hardworking and enduring Chinese laborers to the islands.</p>
<p>In the areas of Hong Kong, Shantou, and Xiamen, the Dutch recruited large numbers of Chinese laborers to exploit mineral deposits. These laborers were called "contract laborers," meaning they were slaves of the Dutch, working for them for life, subject to their abuse, even to the point of death. Therefore, people from Guangdong called the Chinese laborers recruited by the Dutch "piglets." In addition, because the East Indies urgently needed a large amount of labor to develop mineral resources, the Dutch even resorted to extremely improper means, plundering Chinese people to work there.</p>
<p>Later, as the industry and commerce of the East Indies developed, many Chinese came here to open factories and run businesses. Therefore, even now, there are more than one million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>The main industry in the Dutch East Indies is sugar production, which is almost entirely controlled by the Dutch and Malays. Chinese investment in various large enterprises here is relatively low; however, the Chinese hold a very important position in commerce. The export of native agricultural products and the import of European, American, and Japanese goods must all go through the hands of the Chinese. In the area of commerce here, the only ones who can compete with the Chinese are the Arabs.</p>
<p>In recent years, overseas Chinese in the East Indies, like overseas Chinese in other regions, have suffered many blows. Most obviously, Chinese people here must find a guarantor to open a shop and sell goods, and apply for approval from the local government before they can start business. After starting business, they must also pay income tax, business tax, sanitation tax, furniture tax, etc. every year. If they fail to pay on time, they will be arrested.</p>

<p>"The Children Went Crazy"</p>
<p>This is a tragic and painful true story set against the backdrop of a major flood. A beautiful hometown, a happy family. In an instant, they were shattered by the torrent. Mom drowned, Dad disappeared, and they (the children) and their old grandmother had to lie on a wooden board, letting the wind blow, letting the rain beat down, letting it drift along. Everywhere there was the sound of houses collapsing, everywhere there were cries for help. The old trees only showed their tops, the leather sheds only showed their roofs, there were corpses and cattle carcasses in the water, and the sky was a vast white expanse. Just when they were sighing in despair, they suddenly heard a burst of shouts and cries, and a glimmer of hope appeared. Unexpectedly, they found their relatives. After many hardships and difficulties, they finally arrived in the city, but the city was… (Presented by Mr. Xu Shaochang, with sound effects and vocals by Mr. Du Yemu and all members.)</p>

<h3 id="e180">"Hero of the Times" at the Night Garden <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yi Hua is a famous scenery company. Almost every movie has to allocate a large sum of money to build the scenery. It was like that in the past, and even more so now.</p>
<p>If you run into the Yi Hua company these two days, those who have been there will be confused about how Yi Hua changed its face, and those who have not been there will wonder how Yi Hua opened in a big garden. What is the reason? Because Yi Hua is building a large "Night Garden" scene these days.</p>
<p>The Night Garden is the scenery in "Hero of the Times." The area is really amazing. It is surrounded by lights, like a long snake winding around. When they are all turned on, the scene is magnificent beyond description, and in the garden, in addition to pavilions and towers, there is also a huge stage. The new actress Wen Qiu is performing "Si Lang Visits His Mother" on the stage. The gongs and drums are deafening. We think the scene of Jia Fei touring the Grand View Garden in "Dream of the Red Chamber" is probably just like this.</p>
<p>Only Yi Hua builds such a big scene, and only "Hero of the Times" has such a big scene.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Lianhua's Three Major Contributions to Children's Year <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>"With healthy children, there will be everything." Now at the beginning of Children's Year, Lianhua has decided to contribute three great children's films to the builders of the new China, the masters of the future: The first film is "Little Angel" directed by Wu Yonggang, which is about to be premiered at the Jincheng Grand Theater in Shanghai. It thoroughly explains how to create an ideal and healthy child in a social environment and feudal forces.</p>
<p>The second film is "Lost Lamb" which Cai Chusheng is about to start filming. It shows how some wandering children struggle desperately and fight hard in various difficult environments, raising a serious issue for the entire society.
