<h3 id="c18">美國銀價再提高之感想 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 彥</p>
<p>據十日美電稱。羅斯福總統頃决定國內新產白銀收買之價。應自每盎斯六角四分半加至七角一分。並於本日起實行。自此項消息發表以後。世界之白銀問題。即如響斯應。而有顯然之新發展。其漲價趨勢。自紐約大條掛牌由六角五分七五漲為六角六分後。倫敦方面。十一日大條銀現期。先由二十八便士九三七五。漲至二十九便士六八七五。遠期由二十九便士零六二五。漲至二十九便士八一二五。造成九年以來之最高紀錄。午後又因美國購入。銀價又漲二五。現價為二十九便士九三七五。遠期為三十便士零六二五。卽日本方面。亦於十二日發表將銀價提高一元八角。為七十一元七角六分四厘也。</p>
<p>世界銀市。旣隨美國之再度提高國內銀價而騰漲。回顧我國內情形雖標金已因之而狂跌。惟外匯之變動。殊見微弱卽平衡稅率依然為百分之六又四分之三。此種反常之現象實使我人大惑而不能解。據專家估計若以最近之倫敦銀價。與我國之對英匯價相比較。其差數約為百分之三。十而去秋之最高差數。僅為百分之二十。若於此時運銀出口除去出口稅平衡稅運費保險等一切用費。其凈得利益。約計為百分之十一二。卽每運出白銀價國幣一百萬元純益為十一二萬元。以與去年之純益百分之六七相較。其利益之優厚恐非任何人始料之所及。由此觀之。此後我國存銀設不預為防止。殆將有繼續减少之趨勢矣。</p>
<p>抑美國白銀收買案下所須收買之白銀。依現有黃金八、五九九、七四三、〇〇〇元之根據而計算。按金三銀一之比例。國庫應有價値二、八六六、五八〇、〇〇〇元之存銀。惟查美財部現有之存銀。僅値九一五、六一四、〇〇〇元。尙不及定數之三分之一。若美人堅持其定案之政策。繼續收買則恐囊括我華及印度之存銀。亦尙未敷。而我國之貨幣制度。則將遭受自有史以來之空前犧牲。殆可斷言。乃者美國再提高銀價之實行。已有兩日而我政府當局似尙有待於事件之發展。對策若何。尙未獲聞。卽平衡稅率亦未見相當之提高。以我人管見。在此嚴重情况之下。防止存銀繼續出口之有效辦法。亟須當機立斷。從速制定。設再遷延時日。恐影響所及。或將遠甚於曩昔耳。</p>

<p>斯特里薩　歐洲三大强之當軸、昨在此間開始舉行會議、討論與綏靖歐州事有關之各問題、昨日會議中曾切實聲明、關於法國因德國整軍備訴諸國聯一事、法意英三國同以已成之事實呈諸國聯、茲已不成問題、法國向國聯提出之申訴、純粹目為法國之公文、不復在會議中變更其方式云、</p>
<p>英代表發宣言　英代表麥唐納與西門昨曾以英國關於和平與安全問題之立塲、向法意代表詳細說明、並表示英國願就種種實際的方法、助同推進歐洲集團安全制、</p>
<p>路透訪員探悉、英代表所發表者、內有一種宣言、聲明英國願盡其力之所能、鞏固英法意三國間所議作之團結、英代表宣稱、今覺無一國當為其自己政策計、有所僭越、法意英三國對於足以鞏固歐洲和平之各事、不能分離、英代表又聲明英政府現正籌議一種限制軍備計劃、而願由國聯監督實行云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據泰唔士報特派員電、英首相麥唐納曾於昨日斯特里薩首次會議發表宣言、其警句稱、「法意英以保障歐洲和平為其共同目的、今謂三國於此努力過程中將任人離間、實屬不可思議者、據英國之政策、國聯實為國際談判以保持和平之適當塲所、英國準備作相當之貢獻、以促進集合安寗」云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>會議之第二日　斯特里薩　英法意三國會議、於今晨九點三十分續行開會、至正午十一點始畢、今晨會議中所討論者、係法國申請國聯會行政院所可發生之後果、及在將來萬一再行發生破壞條約情事時所應採行之適當步驟、會議畢後、某報記者訪問英相麥唐納、詢以倫敦方面所傳之英國政策是否屬實、麥唐納答謂、「君應知英國政府之合格代表、現在此間」云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>斯特里薩　英法意三國代表今晨集議時、以片面否認國際義務為討論之主要事件、聞討論之範圍頗廣、並不專重於德國、對法申訴國聯一事、考慮已畢、今將詳細研究二月三日倫敦公報中所含之建議、（卽英法皆同意於維持奧國獨立與完整之必要、並主邀德認眞合作、英法皆不以片面否認國際義務為然、歡迎締結歐洲互助公約、又建議以一種恊定代替凡爾賽條約中之軍事條文、德國復返國聯及締結天空公約）午後會議定三十分開始、議程中除倫敦公報外、且有東歐與中歐公約（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>希望德返國聯　斯特萊薩　英法意三國代表今晨九時三十分在波羅摩宮開二次會議、聞將透澈討論意國方面之意見、報界及與會代表方面昨日紛紛議論英國代表團之說帖、其內容遠較他國之意見書為富、其結論稱、英國參加斯特萊薩會議之主要目的、在促進德國復歸國聯、惟麥唐納首相亦稱、此時邀請德國參加斯特萊薩會議、實屬不智云、此項宣言、等於非正式否認將邀請德波及蘇俄舉行六國會議之說、綜合今日開會以前消息、三國似均希望德國重返國聯、惟英國表示較意法更為明顯耳、（十二日國民電）外間對於斯特里薩會議、雖有種種謠言、但確悉昨日之會議曾注重下列之三項、</p>
<p>（一）德國復返國聯之可能、（二）奧國之獨立、（三）使國聯盟約關於對付侵略者之條欵在遇有相關之情勢發生處從速見諸實施、藉以鞏固該盟約、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>前日討論主題　昨日會議中之時間、大半費於法國申訴國聯一事、並因以提及德國重返國聯問題、英方以為此不必附以條件、蓋如附條件或將無益而有害也、</p>
<p>東歐公約問題連同法俄最近之諒解、亦曾透澈硏究、聞未談及德國加入此公約之可能事、</p>
<p>談話空氣友善　昨日午後之討論、歷兩小時半之久據意方消息、空氣殊為友善云、此間一般英人之情感、覺會議已吿成好起點、三國間在原則上未露有意見參差處、會議或須延至星期六日，此間視此為討論已蹬明絕有價値之徵象、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>對德基本政策　三國意見一致　斯特萊薩　今日得悉、英法意三國已同意勿使任何事件、阻碍三國對德之共同行動、三國咸覺在基本政策上如有何不同之意見、卽將墮入德計中、故對於法國所致國聯要求澈底討論德國廢棄凡爾賽和約之牒文將無所修改、且自可靠方面得悉、德國波蘭及蘇俄三國亦將被邀遣派代表來此參加會議、而目前之談話、將為一種預備會議、聞英國因法意代表亟欲採取激烈手段對付德國、今晨已設法阻止、</p>
<p>會後發表公報　意國政府昨夜曾發出公報、報吿首次會議之情形、祇稱、「英首相麥唐納今晨曾略述英國之外交政策、其後英國外相西門曾報吿其遊歐情形、並述德國對於多瑙河公約·東歐公約·空防互助公約·及國聯之態度、午後後會議、法國代表則曾聲明其向國聯提出報吿之理由、並陳述其所希望採取之訐劃」云云、</p>
<p>法訴國聯理由　按三國會議係於昨晨十時三十分開幕、法國代表首先提出法國致送國聯之牒文、該項牒文大槪星期一可以發表、語氣殊為悲觀、文中雖未預言戰事、惟力稱此次危機之嚴重、而以為若能努力設法、猶能解决、該文係由法國外長賴伐爾提交意相墨索里尼及英相麥唐納、但未請彼等核准、因此係純粹法國之計劃、無須他國同意也、惟賴氏亦聲明彼甚願他國詳悉牒文中所載之理由、因德國之舉動、他國若競起效尤、結果卽將不堪設想云、嗣西門外相演說其遍游各國首都之結果、並答覆墨索里尼賴伐爾及法國總理佛蘭亭之詢問、法國代表繼稱、彼等對於會議之印象殊佳、</p>
<p>意法要求各點　其後三國代表卽詳細討論法國之牒文、並悉法意兩國曾要求英國抑阻德國、法意兩國之計劃、後有下列數點、</p>
<p>（一）法國要求、德國如再、反凡爾賽和約、應予以懲戒、</p>
<p>（二）法意堅持萊茵區之非武裝及奧國之獨立不能破壞、</p>
<p>（三）法意要求羅迦諾條約須擴大範圍、附加一種多瑙河條約、包括捷克·羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·奧大利·及匈牙利等國、</p>
<p>（四）法國要求國聯行政院斥責德國破壞條約、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>英官塲之聲明</p>
<p>（倫敦）官場恐外間對於英代表昨在斯特里薩所發表之意見、發生錯誤印象、故今日聲稱、自英代表起程赴斯特里薩後、英國並未有新决定、亦未發表正式新佈吿云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c20">英國所抱政策　大致可歸納為五點 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>（巴黎）據斯特里薩本社特派員電稱、英法意三國閣員、今晨舉行會議、大部份時間係由英國代表對於聘問德俄波捷各國之舉、提出報吿、西門外相並說明此行目的、係欲研究德國對於歐洲和平事業是否仍能合作云、至英國對於此次會議之態度、不外下開各節、（一）參加會議各國、有表現聯帶關係之義務、英國準備竭盡所能、以表現聯帶精神、（二）當在國聯會範圍之內、組織集體安全制度、英國願在種種切合實際之形式下、以眞實力量贊助之、（三）和平事業、須加以組織、組織之法、係將各國軍備比率、加以確定予以監察、（四）一九三三年七月十五日羅馬四强公約、英國仍願尊重、但在目前情形之下、應以英法意三國之聯帶關係、曁國聯會所具有之力量、作為行動之基礎、（五）英國願德國能重返國聯會、但在目前情形之下、未便無條件任其從新加入、以免造成極惡劣之先例、至是法國外交部長賴伐爾、乃將法國因德國重整軍備而向國聯會所提出之申請書、加以說明、聞英意兩國他日定當加以贊助、外傳本月十五日國聯會行政院非常會議結束之後、斯特里薩地方、又將舉行會議、並邀請德國參加、此說經法國方面負責人士加以否認、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c21">英首相不赴日內瓦 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）昨電首相麥唐納出席斯特里薩會議後、擬再赴日內瓦出席十五日舉行之國聯會行政院非常會議、頃據每日郵報駐斯特里薩外交訪員宣稱、首相已决定不赴日內瓦、至每日電聞報訪員則相信斯特里薩萊柴會議之英國代表團、現堅持國聯會行政院非常會議結束之後、他日舉行國際會議、則德國必須參加、每日民聲報亦以為德國現雖拒絕參加互助公約、但英國內閣相信該國對於此項態度、必可重加考慮、該報又謂、英國今後必將繼續努力、勸令德國就範、並探索德國政策眞實目的之所在、此外泰晤士報則提及昨日意大利民報所載一文、謂第二次國際會議之召集、與英法意俄德波六國公約之締訂、不無可能、（按昨日意大利民報載一文、謂最近將來、有邀請俄德波蘭三國與英法意三國舉行另一國際會議之可能云云）、又謂法國方面之願望、以為德國如再度違反凡爾賽和約、則當採取何項措置以資對付其性質又若何、自當完全表明、換言之、卽依照國聯會下接第九版</p>
<h3 id="c22">擴大會議範圍　邀請德波俄參加　英意諒解或有實現可能開會地點將在英京倫敦 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>斯特里薩　消息靈通各界、今日評論意國以為在最近之將來或尙有更廣大之國際會議、德國波蘭蘇俄均將被邀參加之意見、謂此僅為空中之音樂、且為悅耳之音樂云、今晨意國各報雖均視關於此事之任何切實决議為紙上空談、但據路透外交訪員聲稱、斯特里薩各方面皆覺此種會議不久或將實現、其開會地點或在倫敦、尤其因在最近二十四小時內意國與英顯然已有密切之諒解也、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　星期四意大利民報所著之評論發表後、各晚報均予轉載、據法西期太報稱、德波及蘇俄是否將被邀參加斯特萊薩會議、仍為疑問、雖法國對於德國表示反對、然英國固仍舉足重輕、至意首相墨索里尼所稱、意大利現有執戈之士六十萬人、且有最新式之武器、已足表示意國之立塲、故意國儘可靜侯國際之任何變化而不懼也云、（十二日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據負責方面所得消息、英國內閣現贊成訂結與法俄協定相類似之公約、並以為此種公約實係集體安全組織之良好基礎、惟在最後决定訂結此種公約之前、英國必須明瞭德國是否眞願參加集體安全制度、如種種努力後、英國仍不能使德國參加安全制度、則英國當不至反對訂結協定、以保護有關各國之安全、此外負責方面鄭重聲明、英國無論如何、不願在歐洲大陸、受何種新約束、但對於羅加諾條約皮二月七日倫敦宣言書所建議之互助公約、則英國必加以擁護云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>斯特萊薩　美聯社記者得悉、法國將在國聯方面堅持制裁德國破壞條約之片面行動、並將要求規定若干種制裁、法總理佛蘭亭及外長賴伐爾現正研究此項制裁辦法、惟聞此項制裁未必具軍事性質、但為一種經濟制裁國聯會員國、根據盟約第十六條之規定、可一致以此項制裁施諸德國、（十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）民主黨參議員畢德門今日在參院演說、謂財部增加國內銀價、係政府意欲實施購銀法之切實證據、畢氏為銀派領袖、以前曾任簽訂倫敦白銀恊定之美國代表、今日彼謂財部昨日之行動、實為羅斯福總統對於一般人信其將不致實施購銀法之答覆、並稱、據財部發表之數字、總統每月所購白銀達五千萬盎斯、故批評財部謂政府購銀程度業已退步者實無根據云、畢氏預料世界銀價不數月內卽可固定、而一切問題亦卽能解决云、此間以為財部之增加國內生銀價格、由六角四分半增至七角一分一厘一毫、非常重要、因此舉頗足表示政府將來之幣制政策、且有自由鼓鑄銀幣之可能、若干觀察者預料銀價升至每盎斯一元二角九分之時、自由鼓鑄銀幣卽將實行、且其時財部將不收鑄稅云、茲銀派領袖仍竭力設法抬高銀價、財長毛根韜曾發出警吿、擬使彼等勿以激烈之手段改變現行法、毛氏曾致函民主黨參議員麥卡倫、謂國會如擾亂行政方面對於金銀之權力、則國家幣制將受危害、至於毛氏此函孩子來源、係因麥氏曾提出廢止購銀法中授權政府節制或禁正現金交易及進出口之規定云、再參院銀派領袖湯默斯亦稱、銀派對於財部增加銀價雖甚欣慰、惟對於韋勒之提案、仍擬竭力奮鬥、今日參院農業委員會已通過該案、命令政府每月購銀五千萬盎斯、以至銀價成為對金十六比一之時為止、該案由農業委員會辦理、係因其目的為救濟農業及牲畜之故、其實亦為一種策略、因如此卽可免受較為保守之銀行及通貨委員會所阻礙也、至於韋勒案之內容、財部須以購進之銀全數發行之庫券、此種膨脹建議、實為政府所反對、財部今晨宣布、一年以來、已購進白銀四一三、五〇〇、〇〇〇盎斯、至三月二十七日為止、財部存銀總數為一、一〇四、五〇〇、〇〇〇盎斯、而去年五月二十五日、購銀法猶未通過之前、祇有六九一、四八二、〇八五盎斯、財部估計、所有銀塊及銀幣之總値為一、四五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元、其中半數係財部以二十萬萬元之平衡基金在世界白銀市塲秘密購進、迨去年政府以白銀收歸國有、復得一一二、五九四、一五五盎斯、而國內所產生銀亦達三二、六一一、〇〇〇盎斯、惟財部欲達庫存金三銀一之目的、則尙缺十萬萬盎斯也、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國會議員現密切注視白銀局勢、欲察知羅總統提高財部購銀價格行為將否阻遏抑促進此種運動、惟白銀運動現又興高采烈、其中最顯著者、為韋勒氏銀幣案、此案主張照金銀十六與一之比例鑄銀幣、此案今日已為參院農業委員會所贊成、但衆料參院必予以頑强之反對、該委員會之行為、及昨日之發展、已使國會白銀派愈形活動、雖參院領袖確信此案未能通過、但發起人韋勒則謂定可獲有較前更多之同意票、參議員畢特門今日聲稱、羅總統之佈吿已表明其刻正熱切履行倫敦白銀恊定與白銀收買案之條欵、參議員湯姆函致各著名經濟學家與財政家、預現現仍月金本位之國家不久將放棄金本位、此後世界通貨可在複幣基礎上立於安定地位、美國收存金銀愈多、則其左右安定世界幣價之地位愈佔優勢云、世界銀市現皆漲價、紐約大條掛牌為六角五分七五、旋漲為六角六分、西方礦業因津貼增多、異常欣悅、一般輿情以為白銀大都為礦業之副產、在銀產增多以前、其他金屬物之價格、勢必增高、彼等預料將來銀價必可為一元二角九分、惟最後所可有之價格、繫於華盛頓之最後决定、及種種因素、其主要者為遠東大部份窖銀能否為善價所吸引、而流入市塲、據貨幣專家之意見、目前發展尙未有特殊膨脹性質、但若積極進行此種程序、歷若干時期之久、則大有膨脹可能性、彼等預料國會白銀派抬高銀價之壓力、非至銀價將近一元二角九分時未必能减低也、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）若干方面謂羅總統恐白銀派提出更嚴峻之要求、為預先防衛計、故有提高銀價之舉、但垣街人士不以此說為然、謂財部縱不願意完全實現白銀程序、然白銀派確已成功、使當局注意於白銀收買案之條欵、但若財部黃金存積日多、而白銀之存數不能與之同增、則白銀程序將無實施之可能、據財部今日消息、財財部所存白銀、連大條銀幣及流通於外之銀幣、其貨幣上之價値為十四萬五千萬元、故欲成就金銀三對一之比例、則尙須購進白銀十四萬二千一百萬元、查財部最近報吿、其所存黃金現共値八十六萬一千四百萬元、（十一日路透電）</p>

<p>昨爲中國文化建設恊會主辦之全國讀書運動第五日、該會特請陶百川在中西電臺演講怎樣研究黨義、今日下午三時一刻至三刻、該會敦請國立曁南大學理學院長李熙謀在中西電聽演講怎樣研究自然科學、茲錄陶百川主講全文如下、</p>
<p>粗淺的硏究　各位今天中國文化建設協會邀請兄弟演講怎樣硏究黨　、所謂黨義、當然是中國公民黨的三民主義、那麼怎樣硏究黨義、就是如何硏究中國國民黨的三民主義、硏究中國國民黨的三民主義的方法有二種、一種是粗淺的硏究、一種是深入的硏究、現在先講粗淺硏究的方法、所謂三民主義的源源本本、就是民國十二年間孫中山先生在廣州中山大學的宴席稿、包括民族民權民生三種、民族主義有六講、民權主義有六講、民生主義有四講、在這十六篇演講詞中、就包括三民主義全部理諭的精義、這是研究三民主義必讀的一部書、不過一種完備的主義必須包括兩部份、一是理論的體系、二是實踐的方法、或有實踐的方法而無高深的理諭、或有高深的理論而無實踐的方法、都不是一種完備的主義、三民主義、有他高深的理論、當然也有他實踐的方法、</p>
<p>實踐的方法　三民主義的實踐的方法、便是建國方略、建國方略包括三種、第一是孫文學說、也就是心理建設、孫中山先生鑒於一般人受「知之非艱行之維艱一的毒太深、中國數千年來百廢莫舉、一事無成的原因、可說完全受了知之非艱、行之維艱之毒、因此他提倡知難行易、以糾正中國人民數千年來謬妄的心理、他提供了許多證據、說明了許多事理、證明知難行易的正確、第二是實業計劃、以中國之地大物博、貨藏於地、人民反艱難困苦、謀生乏衛、因此在實業計劃中間、他把中國的農業工業商業交通、以及人民之衣食住行等、都加以詳細的計劃、完成了一部偉大的實業計劃、第三是民權初步、中國號稱人民有四萬萬七千萬、然而一盤散沙、毫無團結、所謂各掃自己門前雪、莫管他家瓦上霜、團結的觀念一點沒有、集團的生活當然更談不到、於是孫先生在民權初步中、把集會結社的方去開會討論的次序、群爲規定、所以「孫文學說」是改造人民心理、「實業計劃」是建設國家的經濟、「民權初步」是指導人民合羣合作的方法、除掉建國方略以外、還有建國大綱、這部書雖僅寥二十五條、然而建國的目的、建國程序等、都詳簽訂民族民權民生之間題之如何解決、軍政訓政憲政三時期如何分期實行、在寥寥數百字中、完全提綱摘要的指示了我們、建國大可可以說完全是根據了三民主義建國方略而完成的一部國家建設、除了上述兩部書外、還有一本地方自治開始實行法、在這本書中孫先生把地方自治的重要性、以及施的方法、都有扼要說明、須知地方目治爲國家建設的基本工作、假定地方自治不能完成、其他各種建設當然談不上、所謂修身齊家治國平天下、一切事情都應該從大處着眼、小處入手、地方自治便是奠定一個國家之基礎的、那麼道本書我們當然不能忽略的、要研究三民主義的理論、非精讀孫先生三民主義的演講稿不可、要研究三民主義的方法、便非閱讀建國方略建國大綱地方自治開始實行法這三部書不可、</p>
<p>哲學的硏究　以上是組淺研究的方法、以下要談到深入的研究的方法了、深人的研究、有三種方法、第一從哲學方面研究、第二從歷史方面研究、第三比較的研究、所謂從哲學方面研究、便是研究三民主義的本體論、一種完備的主義、對於過去一定有他觀察的方法、對於現在一定有他改造的方案、對於將來一定他有理想的目標、中山先生他對於過去的歷史、一切社會的演變、他認定有一個根本的力量在支配一切、推動一切、我們從歷史上觀察、由漁獵社會　演進至游牧社會、由游牧社會演進之農業社會、以至工業社會、總之由野蠻而文明這期中間、有一個很大的力量在支配一切、推動一切、這力量就是民生、從哲學方面研究三民主義、就得研究孫先生的民生史觀、就是唯生史觀、哲學有兩大派、一是唯心論、二是唯物論、孫先生的哲學基礎、旣非唯心、亦非唯物、乃是唯生、致於唯生的精詳解釋、他之所以有別於唯心與唯物、以及他之所以高好於唯物與唯心、今日爲時間所限、容後再談、</p>
<p>時代的硏究　第二種研究的方法是從時代性方面着眼、也就是從歷史方面去研究、要知道一種主義、都有他的時代背景、决不是學者在寫字臺上或亭子間中的幻想、有民族問題的發生、才有民族主義的出現、有民權問題的發生、才有民權主義的出現、假定中國今日無民族民權民生問題、孫先生決不會提倡三民主義、唯有權民生問題、孫先生决不會提倡三民主義、唯有三民主義應時代的需要、所以他主義的本身、完全針對國情之需求、世界之潮流、根據主義而不定的種種政策政綱當然更是適應某個時間環境之要求而確立、也可以因某一個時間環境之變動而變一動、這是從歷史方面去着眼去研究三民主義的第二種方法、</p>
<p>比較的硏究　第三種研究三民主義的方法是從比較方而去入手、以今日而諭、在同一時間與空間中、排列了許多主義在我們前面、有國家主義、有共產主義、有無政府主義、有世界主義、有社會主義、其理論各不相同、其方法各不相同、我們如何信仰三民主義而不信仰其他主義、何以其他主義不適合於中國而獨三民主義適合、這種問題、我們精深地認識起見、都有深入硏究之必要、然後我們的信仰方能堅定、我們革命的路綫、才能固牢地把握、例如民族主義與國家主義之比較、民族主義與世界主義之比較、民權主義與無政府主義之比較、民權主義與民主主義之比較、民生主義與資本主義之比較、民生主義與共產主義之比較等、都值得精深的研究、而求得其正確的結論、確立我們正確的信仰、</p>

<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>文化在現代生活中講來，非常重要。而把我們的文化比之歐美，則十分落後。因此有急待努力的地方。這是人所共知的，無需乎多說。</p>
<p>從事文化之活動的，有敎育，有學術團體×等等，而出版事業尤為重要。一切文化活動，無論屬於思維的或實踐的，屬於提高的或普及的，都可從出版事業中看出。所以要明白我們的文化狀况，就須檢討出版事業。</p>
<p>我們的出版事業，有相當浩大的範圍。官府，學校，社團，書店，個人，都在參加。不用說，在這些參加者中間，書店是帶專門性質而為其中心的。</p>
<p>但不管你專從書店說也好，一般地說也好，我們的出版事業有種種缺點，是很顯然的。好處呢？似乎沒有甚麽。而且不說也無妨。重要的是指出缺點來，並從中找一個努力的方向，以推進我們的活動。</p>
<p>這樣，我就開始把出版事業的缺點，加以分析了。</p>
<p>從量方面說，拿我們一年出版的東西與日本，美國，及英法德意等國比，相差得很遠。依舒新城先生的推測，去年「全年計約為二一六〇冊，一七一六種，與一九三一年世界各國出版數目比較，僅多於瑞士而佔第十六位。若以人口比較，則每二一九，二三〇人方佔新出版物一冊，實在比任何國家為少。」（文化建設第一卷第三期一〇五頁）像這樣少的情形，還可以稱為文明國家嗎？</p>
<p>從質方面說，哲學，科學的著作很少，深刻的更談不上。比較地說，文學稍多一點。而最多的，則莫如古書的翻印。好些書店重重疊疊地出版，譬如二十四史，二十五史，二十六史卽是。另外就是競出各級學校敎科書。兒童用書亦成為近幾年出版活動的趨向。畫報不用說也特別發達。</p>
<p>從出版物的量和質兩方面看來，可以說目前應努力的方向，是這幾點：</p>
<p>第一要增加數量；</p>
<p>第二要多出哲學，科學書；</p>
<p>第三要注重高深的著作。</p>
<p>這自然與中國的需要有關係。而在過去出版物在量和質兩方面的貧困，也有原因。合起來說，就是生產不發達，農村破產，又値整個經濟不景氣的時代，敎育未曾發達，研究風尙沒有，不讀書和不買書的敎員，學生及一般人太多了。在這種情形中，欲出版物不貧困，是不可得的。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c181">我的讀書經騐 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 王新命</p>
<p>依我個人讀書的經騐來說，似乎讀書有三法：一是勤讀，二是熟讀，三是精讀。</p>
<p>現在先說勤讀。「業精於勤，荒於嬉，」這是千古不磨的定論，所以不論讀什麽書，總以勤讀為第一義。但我這裏所說的勤讀？幷不是主張營坐牢式的讀書生活，是說讀書的時候應該注意到讀書時間內的動讀；只要能專心，不要想到「鴻鵠之將至」，把外事來擾讀書的心，來分讀書的時，這便算是勤讀。關於這一點，我有相當的經騐。我在十四歲以前，並不了解勤讀的益處，老是好弄花木蟲鳥，身在書室，心在室外，口裏念着書，心裏記着含苞的玫瑰，發葉的揚柳，牆邊的媽蟻穴，樹上的喜鵲巢；結果，讀過的書，都等於沒有讀。到了十四歲，因為受了同學勤讀的刺激，知道非勤讀不能得到書中的要領，更不能有所發揮，於是改變了一面讀書一面馳心騁意在外物的態度；在讀書的時間內，充分利用這時間來讀，不在讀書的時間內，充分利用這時閒來玩；這一來便得了非常良好的結果。因為我最初在三十多個同學中，是年齡最幼稚學業最幼稚的一個，每屆考試，成績總是倒數第一，自經勤讀以後，我的智識便很快地趕上同學，到得年底居然能和年齡最長智識最多的同學爭考第一。</p>
<p>讀書僅是能勤還是不够的，勤之外還要能熟。什麽是熟讀呢？「學而時習之」，就是熟讀。「學而時習之」雖僅是温故，然不溫故，决不能知新，所以溫故在讀書上具有很大的意義。我小的時候，聽到溫故知新的話，總以為是沒有意義的，後來年齡漸長，記憶力漸衰，翻起從前讀而不熟的書，都像陌生的人面，這才知道讀書必須熟讀然後才能够歷久不忘，如果輕輕地放過了他，那就等於不讀。</p>
<p>勤讀和熟讀，固然是很重要，精讀也很重要。精讀有兩義，其一，是擇必讀的書來讀，不必求博，不必求多。其二是不要放過書中的要點，務使讀過的書，都不算枉讀。為什麽呢？因為求博和求多，會犯了「貪多惡得」的毛病，越是想做一個無書不通的人，其結果就越是一書不通，我們與其矜博炫多，不能精讀一書，那就無寗精選書中的菁華來讀，務使有用的時間不浪費在濫讀之下。記得我二十一二歲的時節，喜歡濫讀詩詞，總以為讀得越多自己做的詩詞就會越好，不料其結果竟是讀得愈多，自己的詩詞就越成了填砌的東西，後來，我在恍然大悟之後，做一年多唐詩的工夫，目不旁瞬，却得到意外的收穫，現在署名「漂泊王」的詩，所以居然也得到傳誦一時的光榮，就是一年多精讀唐詩，目不旁瞬的成績。</p>
<p>總之，在讀書這件事，必須合勤熟精的三法，才能够得到相當的效果，如果不用這三法來讀，其效果必然不會很大，從前的人所以有「皓首窮經」之嘆，就是只知勤讀熟讀，却不知精讀的緣故。不知精讀的結果是會皓首無成，那我們就應知舉一反三，連只知精讀而不知勤讀熟讀的結果也想到了。</p>
<h3 id="c182">周作人著中國新文學的源流 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 汪馥泉</p>
<p>北平人文書店印行　實價五角</p>
<p>周作人先生講校的「中國新文學的源流」，是近年來一部重要的著作。固然，周先生底文學的主張，是代表了一部分的學者的；而這部著作底重要，我以為並不在此，而在於「小品文」底提倡。高調公安派，竟陵派及其主張的，是這部書；對沈啓天選輯一近代散文鈔」作提倡式的介紹的，是這部書（「近代散文鈔」，早名為「冰雪小品巴而選輯了，見駱駝革）。當然，「小品文」底流行，自有其社會的根據，「幽默小品」（小品文不是一定內容幽默，此則小品文其文而幽默其內容者也。）甚至于「油腔滑調小品」也都自有其社會的根據；而在紙頭上去尋求，我們不能不追溯到這部著作。袁中郞，晚明十六家等死人之死文風行一世，——不，時髦一時（從銷路上來看，並不風行一世。），歸功歸罪，都得歸到這部著作上去。</p>
<p>周先生底文學的主張，我們可以說，自「人的文學」（此文見「新靑年」，是當時的一篇重要的論文，但注意到的人不多）以來，一直到這部著作，是吾道一以貫之的。歷史上的問題且不談；周先生是主張「言志」（周先生將「言志」與「載道」對立了起來。）的文學的。「言志」的文學（姑照周先生所說），其社會的根據很明白，是所謂「資本主義」及資本主義底產物，周先生本其五四以來的一貫的精神而主張「言志」的文學，這是千該萬該的；那末，「人的文學」中的人道主義的文學，那個「人道主義」不是「道」嗎，不是，不是，那正是五四時代中亦如言志也焉爾的「志」。</p>
<h3 id="c183">介紹倍根的「新工具」 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 杜若遺</p>
<p>辛墾書店出版　深因明譯</p>
<p>五四這動以來，我國學者介紹西洋文化，固然十分努力，但是無論那一門學藝的重要著作，原原本本的翻譯過來的，却是很少。馬克斯介紹了多少年，在思想界發生了很大的影響，然而資本論至今遼沒有譯全。文學家們一逕嘛着託爾斯泰，然而託翁的大作也沒有譯本。哲學家們談起來總離不了倍根，康德，但是倍根，康德的哲學著作品的譯本在那裏呢？所以，中國學者的介紹方法，實在使人有捕風捉影之感。</p>
<p>今日中國文化界的要事，第一是把中西文化的已有的成績拿眞貨給文化人看。孔子的學說如何，該承受麽？該拋棄麽？馬克思的主義如何，該贊成麽？該反對麽？總得有眞貨可看，看了之後方能决定。學者求學，必當研究專著，單讀一些介紹皮毛的雜誌論文，是不够的。但是首先該有專著可讀。學者未必個個懂得各外國文，懂外國文的也未必種種都懂得，所以各種專著，非有譯本不可。誰若能够多翻譯一部重要的學術名著過來，誰便是今日中國文化界的有功者。</p>
<p>現在我看到倍根的名著Novum　osganum日書一，巳有譯本，不覺很高興，要在這裏加以介紹。</p>
<p>弗蘭西斯·倍根（Froncis　Bacon）是英國的大哲學家，兼通法律，經濟家及天文學一五六一年生於倫敦。十三歲時入劍橋三二二學院肄業。三年後出院。一五八二年作律師。一六一六年被舉為國會代表。後來做過皇家律師，檢事總長，至一六一八年又做了法部大臣，時年五十七歲。一六二一年因收賄事件被捕下獄，數日後蒙國王特赦，從此專心研究著述。一六二六年去世。他反對亞里士多德的敎義，要把哲學從經院派繁瑣的爭論中救出，主張直接去經騐自然，以基於觀察和經騐的歸納法為認識自然之眞方法。他的學說對於近代科學影響甚鉅，故被稱為「近代科學之父」。所著有論文集，學問之進步，新工眞等書。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c185">讀書的嗜好 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 謝六逸</p>
<p>從前我讀過弗蘭西斯。貝洛琪的一首詩，內容是講讀書的，大意是：</p>
<p>我如酒徒愛酒似的愛書籍，</p>
<p>越是喝越是覺得其中有神，</p>
<p>我的靈魂歡天喜地，浸在愛裏，</p>
<p>重新舉杯，更覺得滋味不盡。</p>
<p>任身寄何方，書籍全是我的伴侶，</p>
<p>在寂寞時得到安慰，</p>
<p>在孤零時得到友情，</p>
<p>書籍啊！我的寳貝，</p>
<p>你是我頂親熱的友人</p>
<p>你的價値醇粹，</p>
<p>你的友誼眞誠。</p>
<p>因為你我能共前賢密語，</p>
<p>又能和現代的才人相親。</p>
<p>在裏面我看見許多悲歡喜笑，</p>
<p>那些悲歡喜笑戚動了我的心。</p>
<p>我讀過原詩之後，曾將它譯出寫在我的一冊心愛的書上。詩意是很好的，不過以酒徒喝酒的態度比喩書籍的嗜好，我不大贊同。</p>
<p>喝酒的人雖明知酒能麻醉人性，但酒徒們依然嗜酒，非到「爛醉如泥」的程度不止。假如讀書的人選擇了酒徒的態度，我想無論如何是不適宜的。多讀書誠然是好的，但是决不可讀得昏頭昏腦，如喝醉了酒一樣。喝酒的好方法是「微醺」而不至於酩酊大醉；讀書的好方法是越讀頭腦越淸晰，能活用書中的知識，不為書籍所束縛。受書籍的束縛跟被酒麻醉是相同的，結果成了書籍的「化石」。</p>
<p>讀什麽書好呢？除開自己專門研究的書籍，宜「漫續」或者「雜讀」。比如研究哲學的人，除哲學的書籍之外，不妨將涉獵的範圍擴張到園藝，養鳥等，從那些書籍裏面，發見跟哲學有關的知識，豈不有趣麽？（四月五日）</p>

<p>— （陳蘊素）</p>
<p>在每個靑年，差不多都喜歡回憶着過去，憧憬着未來，咒詛着現實。因爲過去好像一隻諫果，給人一種甜蜜的回味；未來好像一枝甘蔗，愈吃愈甜，愈到後來愈有滋味；祇有現實是可詛咒的，痛恨的，不曉得把握住現實，就是爲將來造快樂，過去作回憶的絕好資料。</p>
<p>在春姐姐沒有嫁給我們的時候，我們儘管害着單思病，覺得伊是如何的可愛，如何的美善！等到伊嫁給了我們，我們又把伊擱置在一邊，從不曾回到自然的懷抱中，綠的世界裏，和伊溫存一下，親熱一下，等到後來伊靑春消逝，紅顏老去，我們又立刻見諸筆墨，形諸辭色，來哀悼伊，惋歎伊，這不知是春姐姐辜負我們，還是我們辜負春姐姐哩！</p>

<p>— 適圜主人</p>
<p>在下滯跡抗垣，不覺已有三四春秋，對於人入自古艷稱的「西湖」，雖不敢說老馬識途，自信很有相當的認識，趁這烏語花香遊人如織的時候，特簡略地，客觀地幷且具體地談一談湖景，供給醉心西子湖景的仕女們萬一的參考。</p>
<p>西湖十景，是個個人心嚮往之的中心目標，其實這所謂十景也者，多半是乾隆皇帝弄的玄虛，每個景的所在，有塊「御碑」罷了，那十景當中，幾乎全是抽象的，空泛的，換句話說，不脫中國文人一向的「詩意」，「玄想」，是拿不出眞憑實據來的。十景中的「柳浪聞鶯」，柳旣少有，縱有鶯也無從棲北。「斷橋殘雪」，現在已成爲康莊大橋，汽車通行無阻。「蘇隄春曉」，不知何所指？「雙峰揷雲」是要就大範圍來看的，但揷雲者不只雙峰。「曲院風荷」，院很簡單，夏季偶有荷花點綴。「南屏晚鐘」。從名詞裏就可見出空泛。「雷峰夕照」呢，事實上倒有道理，可惜十前年塔已傾塌了。庶幾還是「三潭印月」，和「平湖秋月」，每到月夜，景緻確實幽雅。「花港觀魚」，你可不必上當，港不成港，花也很少，魚是難得有五寸長以上的幾尾。</p>
<p>以上所說並不是敗興之談，的確是實在情形，如果眞玩湖的話，倒是一些不知名不出名的所在，別有一番風味。還有比較出名的「洞」，如「黃龍洞」，「石屋洞」，「金鼓洞」，……很爲幽雅，可以一訪。幾個什麼「莊子」，也有相當意味。餘外「玉泉」的五色魚，「雲梄」「韜光」的竹子，都可玩玩，二個「天竺」，和「凈慈」……等什麼佛廟地方，名字的確是如雷貫耳，你如不是佛門子弟，大可不必去的。</p>
<h3 id="c200">鄉間的喜酒 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在上海普遍的人們？接得了親友一張喜帖，亳不留戀的向桌上一丟。經濟寬裕些的人，事前飭役送了一份厚禮；尷尬的朋友，臨吃臨送的也不少。到了喜期，交情够得到的，早上去道一聲喜；午後去看婚禮，晚上入席，飽吃一頓，便算完事。交情泛泛的，那末逢吃方到，酒呀菜呀，塞滿了肚子，抹抹嘴便走。在上海吃喜酒，眞覺得平常而又單調的事情。</p>
<p>鄉間的情形可大大的不對了，不但喜事的人家，殺豬宰鷄，忙個不了；便是吃喜酒的人，也是大魚大肉，吃個不休。在事前的一個月內，他們不是搖着船，便是拽紮起褲管，東也請親戚，西也呌鄰舍。他們的請帖，便是口頭的預約，難得有幾家是用紅紙寫就的帖子。親戚們先來，鄰舍們在正日的上一天來。他們送了二角或四角的禮，極少有二元的，扶老携幼，一家們都來；况且從早餐吃得夜飯。上一天的酒筵，總用生跳活蹤的大肉，半熟不酥的鮮魚，還有豬肚裏的五臟。屋子內，塲地上，密密的擺了好多桌；大杯的酒，大碗的飯，狼吞虎嚥，碗底朝天；吃得不够，客人們還可以自己拿了大碗，到廚房內去加添</p>
<p>正日的菜餚，稍爲細緻的了，雖然沒有甚麼魚翅燕窩等名貴東西，可是他們也會請鄉下的名貴上好廚司燒些熱炒，甚麼海參鷄片之類；點心也會有粗甜的八寶飯了；桌角上也會擺着些水果花生之類。這一席稱做正筵，鄉下人也斯文地請呀請呀的吃起來，不過結果總是皮骨不遺，湯汁俱乾。</p>
<p>晚上，男男女女老老少少，擠滿了一新房。新娘子端坐着像廟裏的土地奶奶，動也不敢一動，笑也不敢一笑。新郎面紅耳赤，給一羣酒灌飽肚子的賀客們打趣。笑着，鬧着，直到三更多天，主人拿出了花生瓜子荸薺甘蔗一類的東西，纔打發他們動身。</p>
<p>明天又像前一天吃喝一日，二天過去，喜酒纔算吃畢。主人家所費的錢，別的都有限，單就這吃喝一項而論，倒要佔支出的十分之六七。</p>

<p>那鞋面的本身十九是上好的貢緞，顏色却也各各不同；上面又用各色的絲線挑繡着許多的花樣。這種絲線便是那些製絲的藝工所製染好的，總算省却了一筆往外面去選購的錢。但這些絲線確是太細了，我們只要看了這些絲線，便可以不用解釋，立刻會相信挑繡鞋面的工程，委實是極傷目力的一件事了！</p>
<p>這個製鞋「廠」的重心就在中央的一列正殿上，裏面擺着許多應用的工具，五花八門的不知有多少，大部份是我所沒有寓目過的；後來我雖曾逐一的請問過那兩位領袖的老處女，只是名目極繁雜，此刻早記不起來了。我每次上伊們那裏去的時候，總得敎那兩位老處女取出幾頁新打的鞋樣來看看。這些鞋樣的確是很好看的！用近代人的口吻稱讚起來，眞可說是一種極工緻的圖案畫。往往會使我看得愛不忍釋，不知道那打出這些鞋樣來的姑娘們，當初是怎樣學會這種本領的？有幾幅畫得分外的齊整，看在人的眼睛裏，活像是一雙眞的鞋子，彷彿取下來就可以穿到脚上去；並且它們還不是一色的白描，竟是彩色畫，凡鞋料的顏色，花紋的顏色，無不早已渲染着。待到將來完全做好的時候，便與這紙上所繪的一般無二；儼然是近代那些時裝公司裏所備的一冊樣本。（二九二）</p>

<p>— 孝慈</p>
<p>無錫在全國縣份之中，可算最繁榮的地方，但看它全縣工業與敎育的實際情形，便可深信而不疑；無錫不僅是個模範縣，而且是東南名勝區之一，在過去，只聽得人家如此稱道，不禁悠然神往！此番四四兒童節，幸得專程往游，小駐三日，暢游而歸。這湖光山色的「錫景」，的確別有風味，值得欣賞，值得留運。</p>
<p>無錫的工業，我不會去考察，敎育也沒有參觀，在此怱促的時光，只游覽了幾虛風景而已。無錫的名勝，可以歸納爲四區：（一）惠山風景綫，（二）湖濱風景綫，（三）城區風景綫；（四）四鄉風景綫。我這次所欣賞的，着重在惠山湖濱兩區。雖說這四區各有各的意味，據我看，城區與四鄉倒也平凡無奇，惠山區古色古香，俗氣太濃，惟有湖濱區湖山萬頃，浩氣長存，最爲可觀。</p>
<p>湖濱區之所以引人入勝，因其羣山環拱，面臨太湖，憑這天然山水來佈局，再加人工的點綴，自比他區出奇制勝了。太湖爲我國第三淡水湖，白浪滾滾，島嶼點點，有著名的七十二峯，相傳面積三萬六千頃，氣象的雄偉，於此概見。黿頭渚爲湖濱勝蹟之首，山水園林，所在都是，左近有巴江廖綸摩崖書「橫雲」及「包孕吳越」數大字，形容太湖，頗爲得體。黿頭渚山上景色美麗，不在話下，山頂的太湖別墅，背山面湖，登高遙望，水天相接，這方淸靜地，倒使我興天上人間之感。</p>
<p>別了黿頭渚，循環湖馬路折而行，直達寶界山下新落成的寶界橋，橫跨湖面，全用士敏土砌造，橋汎六十三洞，長約三里，工費數十萬，聞由榮氏捐資搆築。離橋里許，便到了「　園」，臨五里湖濱，遠對廣長溪，形勢天然，景色如畫，園中佈置和格局，不讓江灣之「葉園」。由此至獨目山畔之梅園，穿過十餘里的羊腸曲徑，坐在人力車上，着實有些納悶，好在鄉村野景，够人一覽無遺，也是都市中人的賞心事。梅園係榮氏所造，自山坡至巔，廣植梅樹無量數，陣陣淸風，凉快無比。園內樓臺亭閣，色色俱全。山頂有念劬塔，宗敬別墅，及其讀書處，東有豁然洞，鑿山而成，最高處爲高而夫球塲，遠望太湖，風帆如鴉，別有奇趣。山腰有太湖飯店，專供遊客棲息，我這次也寄宿兩宵，山居平生還是第一遭咧。</p>
<p>無錫眞是人傑地匯的所在，雖說有天然的湖山美景，要不是榮（宗敬）楊（翰西）王（禹卿）三氏肯解囊捐輸，擘劃經營，那無錫禾必有如今日的繁榮吧！</p>

<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>無綫電機中的固定耗阻器，普通有三種，第一種是用耗阻綫繞製的，第二種是在絕綠物上塗炭質薄層，第三種就是所謂「炭質固定耗阻器」，是用炭質細粒滲和了一種絕綠物質的粉末做成的。這三種中，第一種凖確耐用，可惜價格太貴，第二種因製造上關係橫截面積太小，只合於通過小量電流之耗阻器，所以實際上第三種炭質因定耗阻器應用最多，亦最有發展的希望。但是目下市塲上的炭質固定耗阻器，耗阻率尚欠準確，又不甚耐用，未能十分滿意，此所以製造廠無日無時不在研究試騐中，以求出品的改進。</p>
<p>美國LynckMlfg．Co．現製成一種新式耗阻器，無諭在凖確上或耐用上，均能高出舊式炭質耗阻器之上。</p>
<p>據云：老式的所以不凖確而易於損壞，最大原因在於成份的未能一致。因爲做時是用炭質細粉拌和了一種絕綠物質而製成的。耗阻率的大小和炭粉的多少成反比，它的導電部份僅爲難於絕緣物質中的一些炭粉而已，所以一旦受外界的熱力或震撼，裏面炭粉的位置就易發生變動，而影響到耗阻率的準確。此種解說，並有實騐證明。實騐時，通以逾量的電流，而觀察其內部，就可以看見星星的火光；這種星星的火光，無疑地是逾量的電流通過炭粉，因熱而發生的。此外老式耗阻器部剖面，用顯微鏡放大八十倍而攝成的照片，我們可以很明顯的看到其表面是顆粒狀的，而且是多孔性的（Porus）一些不密致。當然表面不密致，就易受到潮氣的侵襲，而致改變其耗阻率。</p>
<p>根據了上面的結果，新式耗阻器的原料與製造步驟，完全經過改革。原料是用二種耗阻（Resistivity）不同的粉末混合而成，由這二種粉末的配合比例，來决定耗阻率的大小；因此導電的部份不如老式的僅限於炭粉了。製成時經過充份的搗拌，而後在極大的壓力下，型成條狀，務使其成份一致，表面緊密。在試騐時這樣的製品，雖然通以逾量的電流，亦不如老式的有星星之火發生；同時放大八十倍的剖面，比較上它的表面要密致得多。所以新式的製品，比老式的要好得多，雖不敢說已能到理想的標準，但亦相差無幾了。下面是幾面實騐上的比較，以窺一斑：</p>
<p>新式的受到二倍的規定電力，甚至四倍的，其耗阻率普通不過變動百份之一弱，最大的亦僅百份之二，又在沸水中亦不致損壞。另一試騐在華要一三五度的溫度下，荷以規定的電力至三五〇小時，其實在溫度曾升到一九三度（因I2R損失），亦不改其耗阻率；而在老式者，則已改變約百份之四至十矣。（餘略去，以節篇幅）又在陰極光試騐（CathodeRayTest）下。新式者在使用時。並不發出雜聲。此外新式耗阻器的本身和豕尾（PigTail）的接觸點，亦曾加以改良，故接觸較老式者更爲完美。</p>

<p>（六）綫路　當零件購齊，卽可開始裝配，從三回路再生式入手，取其接綫簡單，零件不多，效率殊佳。眞空管交流用三七或三八，直流用三零或三三。第二步加一級或二級低放，用變壓器或耗阻交連均可，耗阻交連，音量雖不及變壓器，但耗阻所佔地位經濟，放大勻均，兼無週率性，故常用之。俟裝配低放純熟，已得相當學識與經騐，於是第三步再加一級或二級高放，採用調凖高週率綫路（t．r．f．）此機完成後，其選擇性，靈敏度，及音量，在吾輩業餘家用之，確已綽綽有餘矣。</p>
<p>（七）裝配法　排零件，銲接綫，爲裝配收音機中之重要工作。每見初學伺志，接綫並無錯誤，因未錫銲而遭失敗者，比比皆是。高放與檢波綫圈，切不可置於同一磁塲之中，最佳互成直角，或用鋁罩隔離之。此外如繞製綫圈，須緊密均勻，屏柵二極，接綫須簡短，不可平行。木箱與底座，在裝配之初，可將擴充地位，二留出，以免將來更換，全部重裝。揚聲器裝入木箱與否，可以聽便。交流收音機之電源部份，鄙意另裝一木箱較佳，因並可供給其他試騐之用也。</p>
<p>（八）電源變壓器　業餘家所用之電源變壓器，以自製或向廠家定製爲佳，其次級輸出，乙電最好繞至五百弗打，一安培，加中心分綫，以備全波整流。甲電須分繞一五弗打，三五安培，五弗打，二安培，及六，三弗打，一·五安培三綫圈，俱接中心綫。至於綫圈圈數，號數，及鐵心橫截面等之設計方法，各報章雜誌，俱有記載，茲不贅述。半交流式所用之甲電變壓器，可購一電鈴變壓器之有六弗打次級綫圈者，但電鈴變壓器無中心綫，可以拆下改繞，或橫接一五十，至七十五歐姆之中心電阻亦可。</p>
<p>記者撰述至此，不得不提出最後一言，鄭重忠告於讚者之前日，方今廉價劣貨，充斥市塲，彼奸商固已昧盡天良，惟利是圖，我輩業餘家，萬不可再喪心病狂。貪圖便宜，以致被入譏笑爲五分鐘之熱度也。（完）</p>

<p>（二）電波之抑射角度　電波仰射至海氏層，經海氏層反射而還至地面；但各種仰射角度之電波，並非均可由海氏層折還。按之事實，某波長之仰射角超越某角度時，卽可直穿海氏層而永不折回。故每一波長在海氏層一定情况之下，僅有一最大仰射角度，逾此角度，電波消耗於海氏層外，不能折回。此最太仰射角，除近九十度外，所反射之電波均離發電臺甚遠，跳躍距離遂不能免。由圖一所示，仰射角度减小時，則跳躍距離增加，至爲明顯。波長愈短，最大仰射角度愈小，故跳躍距離亦卽愈長。據太爾民（Taylor）最大仰角度之報告：在春季一千英里之海氏層，四十公尺波長爲五十四度，二十公尺波長爲十八度；一在冬夜五百英里之海氏層，四十公尺爲五十二度，一一十公尺之波長則爲零度。</p>
<p>（三）海氏層之高度　海氏層之高度隨季候畫夜而降升，與電波之仰射角度略有影饗，而與波長之變化大有關係。冬季比夏季爲高：日間比夜間爲低：夏盡最低，約五〇至一百英里，而冬夜最高，三百至五百英里；夏夜爲一五〇至二二〇英里，冬日不過一〇〇至一七〇英里。海氏層升高，跳躍距離因亦隨之增長；由圖二所示，可見一斑。（完）</p>

<p>巴薄斯島婦女的運命，看起來是極其不幸的！不准離島他出，做人應有的自由行動，已被剝奪得乾乾淨淨了！即日常出遊，亦必以一黑布將面部幪蔽，只餘眼睛看物，這個直更不給人當作人看待呵！</p>
<p>然而畢竟也有例外，現在西人雲遮氏拿出十餘萬元的金錢來作保證金，政府便破例放出了二十幾個舞女去環遊世界了。財可通神，這話的確不是欺人之談！</p>
<p>不過該島政府，平日對於當地婦女，管束既這般嚴厲，故現在他們雖然把這二十幾位的舞女，放了岀去，他們還是不能安心。因為這些舞女，盡屬處女，當局為保全她們處女的尊嚴計，便想岀一個巧妙的方法，和那位西人訂立了一個條約，他日舞女返島時，須經醫生檢騐身體有無變化，方准將保證金領回。否則充公。這計策果然萬全，那位西人，為了顧及那十餘萬元的血本起見，特地就僱用了一個島婦和二個西婦，日夜嚴密監視，以防萬一。這無異代該島政府負起管束這二十多個處女的責任了。</p>
<p>但是我們真不解，這個已薄斯島的政府，為什麽對於一般婦女，要這樣束縛呢？對於處女，又看得這麽重呢？這為的是誰呵？自然是為了男子！不然，他們就不會如此措施了。</p>
<p>然而奇怪，處女可貴，金錢更是可貴呵！巴薄斯島的當局，雖然很看重處女，但只要有了金錢，處女也是可以出賣的了！否則充公四個字，這不是明白説，若這些舞女檢騐後，身體有了變化，把十餘萬元的保證金沒收了，便可了事嗎？</p>

<p>我讚美雨，凡是它留在記憶上什麼景象，都忘不掉，而且喜歡用著一種織細的感情加以追蹤。雨能夠有改移你的心境的潛力，同時更適宜於一個習慣孤單的生活的人的沈醉，它可以驅除你身界外所有的惡俗的紛擾，佈置一個靜寂到不能再靜寂的境界，使你幾乎除自己以外遺落了一切的存在。但它的多樣的幻美的圖飾和奧妙的意味，卻不是每個人都得能領略，它真像一首隱晦的詩篇，非細心眼兒是無從窮其底蘊的。也許是當在黃昏的時候，忽然天上出現一大朶暗雲，天漸漸地黑下來，大概雨就要來吧，低估正在那麼想著一邊兒雨已經微微地灑著，接著愈落愈大，於是一下子工夫，地上，屋瓦上，樹葉上，全濕淫</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>淫起來了。你倚在窗前凝視着，不久之問，那剛才明麗地呈映在眼底的遠處的景物，也被濃重的水氣籠罩着，隔一層烟霧似的糢糊了。便是在窗外的街中來往着人物的交織映像的姿態，也同樣湮歿在濛濛雨的里邊，差不多什麼東西都瞧不見。因爲窗格的玻璃是呌雨水包滿了。再接着天完全暗透了。只有漸漸瀝瀝的雨聲在饗着，成爲黃昏中唯一的獨奏曲。這樣一來，你的心情總不由的跟着起了狠快的變易吧。橡雨把外邊的自一然界變易了二樣，若是在雨未落之前，你是預備出門的，然而雨已然無端地滴答着，路是泥濘不堪了，誰高興再跑出去，另換個時間吧，頓然地你會打消了出門的念頭，而安心的坐下來，究底去不去呢，全用不着這樣的遲疑，雨是那末綿綿地降着，馬上不會停止的。在平常，却免不了於躊躇不决，此刻，是絕對不用顧慮到這些了。祇有一個心，不必去。縱使是有着要緊的事兒，但相約着的對方也許已猜凖你不會來的了，而或者已將等候的事拋棄，正爲你决定不必去那樣。雨是會無形中給你一些安閑的舒適，假如你是最欲靜的話，這時候是最靜沒有了，雨阻斷了將來造訪你的人的足步，因此你一點也不須担心有音外的煩擾發生，儘管一心一意想你所欲想的，以及做你所欲做的。</p>
<p>到了深夜，也許繼續着的雨更大些，你獨自坐在明亮的燈傍，周遭是無聲無闐的墓石一般的沈寂，包圍着你的就只有外邊滴滴篤篤的雨，你傾着耳朶聽那簷雨霤在一起一落的打奏。輕輕地，重重地，一下接着一下的更覺淸脆，鏘鏗，好像從你的心底深處穿了過去，連着你的靈魂都像浸到里邊去了。你的感覺感到一陣異樣的鬆軟，並且挺純美像一池澄明見底的湖水，而身子却像微塵不染的燕子般，揷着翅膀飛上了理想的國度去。隨着忘却了心中所有的愁憂繽紛的粗糙的人生之綱的制纏。雨眞是能給予你一種忘我的幻境，心靈上的枷鎖的解脫。而這種賜與是誰都可以去尋求，有雨，雨在落着，隨時隨地有的是。不過不能承受雨的眞正的美妙的意味的人，却不同，雨對於他反成爲一種可厭的東西，尤其是一連幾天老下個無休無止，除了屋子里之外沒有一片乾凈的地方，如何不惱煞，把日常生活的範圍縮小到賸下一個屋子里，好動好溜躂的人大多是咒詛雨吧，因爲雨會無情地打滅他們在外面一切的興緻。而其與雨不能有因綠也莫怪的了。</p>
<h3 id="c214">好好先生傳 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 江天</p>
<p>四面底亂草環繞着的破廟，雖然在從前也是一個香火最盛的地方，鎭上和遠近底村里，誰都在初一十五要到這兒來抽一條籤詩的，因爲這里的籤詩是頂靈的，十抽倒有九次中。因此香火就一日一日的盛起來。</p>
<p>可是只有二年，這里已經是完全變了樣了。不但遠近底村子里沒有人上廟，就連鎭上也沒來過一個人了。這原因，廟祝是明白的，不過他總是要傻想，爲什麼這樣會顯靈的聖神沒有人來拜呢？就是年成壞，天災人禍的弄得家破人亡，但求求神　　　是應該的，這些人眞不知怎麼想呢？</p>
<p>廟祝死死地守了二年，他希望會再與旺起來，就不如舊時的盛况，但最少也得有人上廟呀！可是廟祝的這個希望是一日一日的破滅，終於使他失望去了。他不能呆在這所已是二年沒修整過的破廟里餓着肚皮活下去了。他只好放棄他這發財的土地，走到另外的地方去謀生活了。</p>
<p>廟宇本來已經就是破舊了，自從廟祝走後，更是不堪了。四面底亂草，參差不齊地蓬勃起來，從前底香火繁盛的聖地，今日已是變成一所荒蕪的廢墟。</p>
<p>整整底幾個月沒有人住過，那亂草是長得把廟門都掩住去了。廟內是一股臭氣的濡濕着，蜘蛛的網會把那神座上佈得不透氣，座灰是已有寸來厚。</p>
<p>這所破廟，幾乎在人們的腦里被忘記了。這年頭，誰也不會再上廟來燒香了。可是，這却合了好好先生的胃口，他正可以亳不受人注目的住進這所破廟里來，到現在，他已住了一個多月了。</p>
<p>鎮上只有一所公立的小學合一個私家學校，私家學校是在二年前把門關起了。公立學校還算堅持得好，到了今年實在沒辦法才關起來。但門口却貼着一張通告，說是暫停一學期，可是誰還相信，這樣蕭條底市面，還有什麼人讀書，還有什麼人拿得出錢來捐給學校呢？店不關還是萬幸哩！</p>
<p>許先生是老實人，在鎭上已是敎了十幾年書了。他不是本地人，在十幾年前他是來這里做區所約書記的，那時他已是四十歲左右。區所里的書記做了幾年，他就給請在公立學校里敎書。因爲他的人老實合年紀也老些，所以學校的執事人如何變動，敎員年年更新，可是却只有他，從來就沒動過，還是一年一年的敎下來。誰不知道，鎮上算是他的學識最好，敎出來的學生，都是知書識理的。</p>
<p>許先生在鎭上漸漸地有名聲起來，學校里的學生們，也都因他敎得好而且老實，誰也都喜歡他。本來他就有一種沉默的性格，什麼事情他都很遲緩的，從沒看到他急什麼事。到現在，年紀是老了，那更是成爲一個老成持重百事和平的好好先生了。鎭上的人，幾乎是誰都知道他是一位好好先生。</p>
<p>可是，事往往不會從人願的，從二年前到現在，鎮上的不景氣是日甚一日了。不說是村里沒父母送兒子來讀書，就連鎭上除了幾家較爲有錢的人之外，誰也沒錢給兒子去上學了。漸漸地，學校就淸靜起來，到了今年，經費無着也就停下來了。</p>
<p>學校一停課，這位好好先生就亳無生活的辦法了。起初還可住在那所空洞洞地學校里，近來給人租去放貨，住的問題就使好好先生起了恐慌了。</p>
<p>幾日的找尋，他終於找到這所與着學校有着同一運命的破廟。</p>
<p>從此之後，他就住在這個爲人所忘記了的破廟里，但他還在想着：</p>
<p>「只要年成好些，學校一開辦，我又是一個敎書先生了。」</p>
<p>可是，這種希望，畢竟是不會來臨了。</p>

<h3 id="c215">湄南河畔之夜 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>太陽斜了西，浮在緋紅色的湄南河上，歛收了灼熱的火燄，大銅鑼般大，紅最的像鹹鴨蛋的蛋黃，靜悄悄地沉鑽到漣漪的水里去了。</p>
<p>此時，碧海似的藍天儘舖着片片鱗鱗的晚霞，映着湄南河上的萬道金波，宛如一條無邊際的長蛇，微微地蕩漾着。南國的傍晚綺麗幽靜的景色，是多麼美麗悅人的啊！</p>
<p>湄南河的兩岸的「梯頭」（梯頭比碼頭小一點，有着碼頭的用途，都是用柚木架成的。）人頭漸漸的多起來了，—些異邦漂泊的流浪者啊！他們做完了自天里的辛苦沉重的工作，吃過了晚飯，口里輕快地吹着富有誘惑力的南國情調的口哨，赤條條地提着鐵桶在河畔乘凉。自然，這時他們的談話的資料，又是在那些赤裸着上半身，露出兩隻新墳似的尖聳的乳峯的風騷美麗的「番邦」的妮子底身上了。</p>
<p>「秉興哥，我們乘好凉之後，一同到三角街上去飲杯冰咖啡，」小夥子余阿狗彎着身子從河里汲上一桶水來，在頭頂上沒頭沒腦沙沙地冲下去，轉過腦袋來對着口哨吹得多麼輕快有勁的秉興說。「然後一同上「天外天」去聽戲，那里新來了一個女旦，黑溜溜的眼睛時向檯下瞟，蠻漂亮的！我來做個東道，去不去？……」</p>
<p>那個呌做秉興哥的年靑的傢伙，却一聲也沒有回腔，儘管提起鐵桶來在河裏汲着水，淋淋地從頭頂上沒頭沒腦地澆着，口里吹起熱情奔放的哨訓子。</p>
<p>「怎麼啦？請你上「天外天」去聽戲去不去？……可不是棧房里的後面那個「番」妮子把你迷昏了！」余阿狗打着他的臂膊，裝着很生氣的樣子。</p>
<p>「哼，哼……阿狗哥，眞是對不住！我今晚還有點事情。」</p>
<p>同事們誰個不知道秉典是個最喜歡吊「番妮子的膀子和上戲園里去聽戲的傢伙，在平時，祇要太陽一鑽進湄南河的水里去的時候，他的靈魂就會被牠們攝去了。爲什麼今晚要他一同去逛逛，他就偏說有事情，這使余阿狗的心里有點落得不自在！然而，又不好意思再三免强他。於是，他在秉興的臉孔上端詳了一會，用鼻音笑了起來！</p>
<p>「哼，…你這傢伙，去你的吧！我曉得你今晚一定和那「番」妮子有了約會的。我曉得！哼…阿狗哥對他做了一會子鬼臉，隨後，就提了鐵桶篤篤地離開了「梯頭。」</p>
<p>秉興揩乾了身上潮濕的水氣，穿好了衣服，沿着河畔悠閒地緩步着，一直走到「皇家梯頭，」他才停了脚步，呆呆地向江心瞧着，出了一會神。「這時，她該是來了的時候了。」秉興低着腦袋地想。</p>
<p>「秉興哥，你一定等得心里很焦急吧？真眞對不住！」少女的聲音，輕微的，溫柔的，像一隻歌唱着的夜鶯。</p>
<p>頓時秉興的心就快活起來，臉孔像春天的玫瑰花似的。這時，他的心花也開放了！</p>
<p>「琍娜，怎麼這個時候才來呢？月亮已溜上椰林的樹梢頭上了！」</p>
<p>他們平着肩擠得緊緊地坐在「梯頭」上，望望如練靜謐的江水，親蜜蜜地喁語。</p>
<p>除了他們的纏綿軟柔的談話聲，尖銳的笑聲，和不時地有着魚躍出那平靜的水而而又落下去的脆的淸聲響之外，一切都靜寂寂地在月光下躺着。湄南河畔的夜，是多麼有詩意凉快靜穆的啊！</p>
<h3 id="c216">歸國的前後 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 重林</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在「大達娘」船上的第一夜，我困倦的躺在艙上，無聲的透了幾口長氣，好，動身前的一切忙亂已經結束了，人同行李已經平安地搬在船上了的如果我們的船不像「喬治菲理柏」那樣地在大洋中燒起來，那麼我們可以耐心地等待見着我們的上海罷。</p>
<p>可是一種新的瞳瞳，不安，擔心在我腦中起來，久夢中的中國，我就要見着牠了，這可是眞約？是眞的，自己禁不住笑起來了，但是自己的笑聲立刻引起了憂愁，於是還國這事，就變成了好似不得不然而做的。</p>
<p>抵新加坡的前夜，在甲板上乘凉，一種草的氣息——東方的草的氣息——從兩旁島上遠遠的吹來，陡然像一針麻醉藥中到我的腦子裏，引起我以深沉的鄉思。</p>
<p>新加坡的碼頭上，我見到一位來送行的時式的中國小姐——或太太——她的服裝是我多年來所意想不出的式樣：長的綢衫，下面開口在開到大腿邊，短袖，高而硬的領，她的頭髮是電燙了的，高跟鞋。然而我就近看她時，看她那縮緊的兩臂，俯着的不挺直的背，不禁爲她發生一種不舒服而不安的戚覺，我恨不得對她說：</p>
<p>「你挺起你的背來，爲什麼縮緊你的兩臂？自然一點！有精神一點！」</p>
<p>同船的一位學彫刻的王君，他不像平常中國式的藝術家，很有一點實際的思想，批判事物有時很與我們相近。他開始發戚慨</p>
<p>「中國人就愛那種肉麻，我見慣了裸體的人體，但並不覺得肉麻，中國女人現在的裝束，長衫開到大腿上眞呌人見了肉麻。」</p>
<p>「眞的，如果要把大腿露出來見太陽，那麼索性可以把衫做得短一點。」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c217">「煤」是植物麼？ <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在最近貴欄中，我觀見先生所述關於「石油的產生及其用途」的文字，簡明扼要，使我們這些亳無科學知識的店員，得到許多學識上的帮助，實在感佩得很。</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>由於「石油」，便　　我的藏在腦海　己經很久的問題，所以特寫信請問你。我想你對於石汕旣肯這樣詳細的解說，那末對於我的問題，大槪不致於拒絕　？</p>
<p>現在有一樣東西，爲用很廣，在工業　更是缺不了的東西，這就是人人所知道「煤」。對於「煤」，我們可以算是天天看到它，一塊一塊的黑色東西，本來是不小什麼希奇不過假使用學者的態度，去追究起來，却使我無法解答我的問題了。譬如：煤是像植物一樣由地下長出來的嗎？是什麼東西燒成功的嗎？還是另有原因嗎？因此我曾問過別人，別人也不能明確的解答這些問題。最後就不得不　麻煩你了。我想你一定能給我一個指導吧</p>
<p>還有：「石炭」和「煤」是不是兩種東西？敬請撰安楊愷聲敬上</p>
<p>編者按：「煤」然是一種很普通的物質，知道它如何生的人一定很多，並沒有什麼希奇：但根據一般人的知識程度而論，我們相信對於「煤」的認識很糢糊的人，一定也不少。所以便簡括的叙述如后。</p>
<p>「煤」就是「石炭」的俗稱。談到這些石炭的產生的原因，還是太古時候的事。在很古的時代，地球內部的熱度是比現在高得多了，那時的海水便爲高溫度所熱。這熱海使空氣中的溫度增高，露和水蒸氣充滿大氣裏面；同時大氣要所含的炭酸氣也比現在多，所以能使植物繁茂。現在的人便稱那個時代爲石炭世紀植物羊齒類繁茂的時代。那時植物生長的速度，决非我們所能想像得及。據說植物的種子，落在地上，卽時生芽，不多久卽長成大木，接着大木便倒下枯死，幼的植物相繼繁茂。地面被倒了的的植物的殘骸和種子覆沒以後，所生的植物每枯死，便又重在上面。這些植物的殘骸，次第重疊，達於數百英尺或數千英尺的厚度：此種厚植物殘骸的層後多沉於海底，泥和砂壓在上面，漸漸堆積起來，又厚達數千英尺。不知經過幾萬年，埋在那很深的土的底下的植物殘骸，漸變化，植物成分中的「氫」和「氧」漸漸失去，（　留蓄着　）　碳素質便變成今日這樣的石炭。</p>
<p>石炭有無　炭，黑炭，褐灰，泥炭的區別。無烟炭是錄上等的石炭，燃時不生煤烟。這種石炭的化學變化大抵已終了，幾乎全部是碳素的石炭。以下照黑炭，褐炭泥炭的順序，漸漸下等，尤以泥炭爲最。因爲泥炭的化學變化還沒有完，所含的「氫」相「氧」極多，燃時也不大會燃燒？出的烟也極多。</p>
<p>還有那由石炭乾　而成媒焦油，可以製作種種染料和藥也是工業上的重要材料。爲了篇幅所限，下次有機會再談它吧。</p>

<p>— 朱橫</p>
<p>電影商人在香艷肉感的大腿歌舞片，和緊張可怖的戰爭野獸片，不能再爲觀衆所歡迎的時候，他們的生意眼便轉移到文藝作品來。他們的生意眼的確不錯，他們的的確確是根據，「經濟學」來轉移他們的方針。可不是嗎？文藝作品之攝爲影片，其銷路當然是可靠的，因爲題材的內容早就給大家所熟悉了。有這樣的廣告基礎，一拍起雷影，當然可以轟動一時了。當然，製片商人亦有其動人聽聞的口頭禪，那就是提高觀衆的文學興趣和文學作品的欣賞罷了。</p>
<p>文藝作品之搬上銀幕者，已經不少了，名字大家都陸得，茲不再贅舉。而現在所要叙述的，就是迭更斯先生。我以爲這位先生可算是目前影片商們最賣貴的搖錢樹了。因爲他的小說已風行了幾十年，讀者的範圍最廣。他們根據這種理由，所以一下結論便齊聲附和地說「一定可以賺錢」的。</p>
<p>你看，他的作品已攝成影片而與滬人相見過的，有美國的童星狄基摩爾主演的「苦兒流浪記」，環球公司出品，菲立霍姆斯主演的「獄底餘生」和現在正在放映的「塊肉餘生」等。現在各公司正在開攝的，環球公司有神秘的「愛溫特魯」（TheMvsteryofEdwinDrood）。此片是由克勞特雷恩斯（ClaudeRains）主演，大部份演員都是英國人。迭更斯這部小說是充滿了緊張的空氣。據環球的人員說，將來此片成功，必定可以呌座，因爲此片是環球公司自朗却乃的「鐘樓怪人」以來的最偉大恐怖片也。</p>
<p>在英國的好萊塢——愛斯的里——攝製中的卽有「老古董店」（TheOldCuriosityShop）。此片的導演爲英國着名的迭更斯專家（ThomasBently)他在過去曾經有一個時候在英國舞台專門扮演迭更斯書中的人物，而博得美譽。</p>
<p>正在預備開拍的有的雙城記」（AtaleofTwoCities）和（PickeickPapers）兩部。這兩部小說英美各公司都在紛紛議論要開拍。據最近的消息傳來，華納公司决定攝（PickwiokPapers）而以偉大的個性演員蓋基比（GuyKibbll）飾（MrPickwick）英國亦已决定攝製此片。將來也許會比美國片先行應市，熟優熟劣，讓我們等着看罷。</p>
<p>英美影界今年可以說是「迭更斯年」罷。不過等到文藝電影再爲觀衆所厭惡的時候，影片商的生意眼未知又要轉向何處？</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c224">評「彩虹曲」 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Aunta　Sally—光陸映</p>
<p>滑稽歌舞片「彩虹曲」，誠如它的主題歌「春雲彩虹」這名兒一樣，而和雲霞虹霓似的東西，只是空幻，虛構，以及無理的偶然與巧合。</p>
<p>爲了便於指出這些欠妥之處，該先略叙它的情節：紐約夜總會大王凱利，爲了逃避當地流氓的騷擾，跑到倫敦開設了一個大規模的夜總會。他以「春雲彩虹」這歌舞節目爲開慕的號召，在幾百少女應招而來受訓練的時候，突然來了一位自認有表演天才的莎麗，似痴非痴地和他纏着要求加入表演。她在幾次被拒絕後，投身在凱利家中充當使女。他雖對她漸由厭惡而轉爲喜歡，但終未允她獻身歌舞的要求。</p>
<p>莎麗，胃充了法國著名的歌星莎莎來見凱利，果被錄用爲主角。在下塲演出前的化裝時，被從前那批流氓綁架走了。戲在流氓與凱利講斤頭，及莎麗的設法逃出匪窟這些方面緊張起來。結果是她逃回來趕演了主角戲，在表演中打死了謀殺凱利的匪徒而被他「感德」地娶爲夫人。自然，善有善報，惡人如流氓等當然也是應得其惡果地而落法網的。</p>
<p>這不但善惡報應，大團圓這類的尾巴是庸俗平凡，而它整個虛搆的故事也是如何的不合理呵！事實上，旣能博得夜俱樂部大王之稱如凱利者，照例應該是流氓中的大亨巨頭了，可是，這兒竟是個怯儒的弱者，而且竟能潔身自好，——如劇中的不願與流氓來往——，這是不合理者一。凱利對於那個似痴非痴，屢次煩擾了自己，而且朝夕相見的下女莎麗，竟因爲她化了裝，便不認識。而把她當做眞個是法國名歌星莎莎，給與她主角的位置，這是不合理者二。同樣的在所謂「跌撲舞」中作莎麗配角的人，臨時被匪徒喬裝上塲，居然能如劇中所演的那麼跌撲地演下去，而不爲凱利或前後台的主其事者識破，這是不合理者三。至於如莎麗被關在地屋中的逃脫，又剛剛有機器脚踏車被趕回，與化裝好了的配角恰巧到門口被匪徒打昏了刺服裝去喬裝等的偶然與巧合，更是不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>倒是倫敦與紐約同樣的是流氓橫行，會在大庭廣衆中綁票暗殺這一暴露：與今天是下女，明朝就可假充明星，居然功成名就這一諷刺，却是相當地流露了的。</p>
<p>LimWhelan有在導演上是爲仙自己所編的這劇本極爲努力的，不但以多　的，圖案的幾塲歌舞，如雲霞彩虹地使觀衆暫時忘卻現實的不滿，以及凱利在流氓的槍口下講斤頭，歌舞進行與莎麗逃脫這幾方面的緊張情緒中，剪接上乃是獲得了極大成功的。</p>
<p>號稱女卓別林的茜雪萊考德耐那種裝腔作勢的演技，却有些使人不敢恭維。自然，在假充莎麗後的兩重人格與名歌星的那一股子勁，也　她表演得出啊</p>

<p>— 彤雲</p>
<p>佐丹說話時候的態度，是很嚴厲的。他又繼續着說道：「我從前已經警告過好幾次，尤其是你對於我的朋友的態度。不過這次你却做得太過份了」。雪倫聽了佐丹訓斥着傑姆勃郎却，頭不覺抬得高高的，臉上露着非常得意之色。她對着佐丹道：「再會吧。我要走了。我的母親還在桑特海濱總會等着我哩」。她說着得意揚揚的走了出去，對傑姆理都不理。</p>
<p>傑姆等雪倫走了，就對着佐丹道：「你看着，你不用着急。我辭職好了」。他說了，就走了出來。巴爾和蓋伯聽見傑姆勃郎却辭職，他們亦要一同辭職，但是傑姆吩咐他們道：「你們要留在這裏，不能走的。你們一個人都不能走開。等我尋到了新聞，你們好馬上寫出來的。」他說完了，就離開了報館。</p>
<p>傑姆離開了報館，一直跑到桑特海濱總會，去尋雪倫。他尋到了她之後，態度是很謙卑的。他說他自己明白做錯了事，現在已經被解除了職務，不久就要回堪斯城去了。「但是頭一件事我要做的」，他說，「就是要向湯梅彭尼斯德道歉。但是他不肯和我在電話裏講話。所以我還得求你。你祇要說一句話，他就肯見我了」。</p>
<p>雪倫相信了他的話，就答應了他。等到他們坐上了汽車，一路往彭尼斯德家裏去的時候，雪倫已經不像先前那樣神氣了。她本來存了一個報復的心，要眼看着傑姆勃郎却自食其報的。但是到了現在，傑姆巳經將離開紐約而往堪薩斯去的時候，她忽然覺得一陣莫名其所以然的難受。他怎樣利用她的一切，她現在都忘記了。她覺得自己一顆心，爲他而降惜，雖然從事實上看來，他不見得有愛她的心。</p>
<p>等到他們到了彭尼斯得的門口，雪倫心中一陣難受，幾乎不能忍受了。可時傑姆走進了彭尼斯德的家裏，也亦不向彭尼斯德道歉。他東張西望的徘徊着。雪倫亦原諒他，知道向人家認罪，是一件多末失面子的事，所以他遲遲難以啓口，這個時候，彭尼斯德忽然問道問「雪倫，我並不是並粗魯，但是我要知道勃郎却先生來這裏做什麼的的」</p>
<p>雪倫對傑姆　了一眼，囁嚅着道。「唔……唉……事實是這樣的」勃郎卻向她瞪了一眼，好像是叫她不要說話的意思。他於是自己說道：「我來到府上，持爲要告訴你，我是多，聽見了外面的謠言，就信以爲眞了。就是有人說珠歷亞柏德森曾經代你付過銀行裏二十萬塊錢的借欵，我部相信了了。他假裝將手指敲着自己的頭道：「我眞是愚不可及了。</p>
<p>彭尼斯德微笑着。雪倫心裏漸漸疑惑起來，覺得傑姆的言語，不像認罪的樣子，而他的態度，已經不似以前那樣謙卑了。可是傑姆還嘮嘮叨叨的說道：「我還想……或者昨天晚上，你將珠麗亞柏德森，搖到她家裏去的。你不是有一隻小船嗎？不過這都是你自己不好，讓我這樣瞎猜瞎想。你爲什麼不告訴我，昨天晚上你到底在什麼地方的呢」？（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">After the Confluence at Guantai, the Water Level in Changyuan Gradually Recedes; the Hebei Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Aid Spring Plowing; River Workers are Rushing to Protect Various Embankments <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 12th, the Hebei Provincial Government received telegrams from Zhang Qinglu, the Magistrate of Changyuan County, and Qi Shou'an, the Director of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, reporting that the gap at Guantai had been closed after day and night efforts, and that it was completed on the 11th. Currently, they are engaged in reinforcement and emergency repair work. The Provincial Government replied, ordering them to expedite the remaining works on all sections to ensure complete success. Magistrate Zhang Qinglu telegraphed the province, stating that the water level outside Changyuan City was gradually receding due to the closure of the Guantai breach, and that some fields were exposed, making spring plowing possible soon. Upon receiving the telegram, the provincial government decided at a regular meeting on the 12th to allocate funds to aid spring plowing. It is reported that the Guantai breach was closed, which is indeed an unexpected success. River workers have been ordered to supervise the repair of various embankments, reinforcing and raising them, and to take precautions to ensure complete success. With the receding waters in Changyuan, spring plowing is possible, and the provincial government will allocate funds to provide assistance. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government decided at its regular meeting on the 12th to allocate 6,000 yuan in relief funds to Changyuan, 3,000 yuan to Puyang, and 1,000 yuan to Dongguang, to continue assisting disaster victims. The Hebei Civil Affairs Department sent a written message to Zhang Qinglu, the Magistrate of Changyuan County, Zhang Yinglin, the Magistrate of Puyang County, and Ye Zhenmin, the Civil Affairs Department's Disaster Relief Commissioner, instructing them to quickly investigate and report the area of arable land where the water has receded, the area where the water has not receded, whether the disaster victims in the villages where the water has receded can return to their villages to cultivate, the number of disaster victims still requiring relief, and to organize the repair of disaster victims' housing, purchase plowing oxen, farming tools, and seeds, and the amount of agricultural loans needed, and to solicit opinions from various counties on post-disaster recovery. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The Provincial Telephone Bureau, noting the unpredictable changes in the Yellow River's course and the frequent damage to the installed underwater cables, dispatched Zhang Zixiang, the Chief of the Engineering Section, on the 12th to Heigang to investigate and repair them. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Zhang Fang, Chang Zhizhen, Yan Zhuang, Duan Honggang, Chen Ruzhen, and others went to Guantai at 9:00 AM on the 12th to inspect the actual state of the confluence. They returned to Bian in the afternoon at 5:00 PM and reported that the breach could already be crossed by people, as the flow was being cut off. This unexpected success was due to the rise in water on March 22nd, coupled with strong northerly winds, which naturally exposed the diversion channel that was intended to be excavated at a cost of 300,000 yuan. The water in the disaster area has fallen sharply. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission received a telegram on the 11th from Kong Xiangrong, the Director of the Labor Relief Group of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association, stating that his group had been ordered to take charge of the Guantai breach plugging and remedial project, which was progressing rapidly and had been successfully plugged at Chenshi (around 7-9 am) on the 11th. The association has informed all parties accordingly to offer their congratulations. The project to repair the Huayang Embankment and the breaches along the Jiugu Road area should be handled by the Hebei Provincial Yellow River Affairs Bureau, as decided in the previous meeting of relevant agencies in Bian. The commission has telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government to instruct them to commence construction immediately and has already allocated a portion of the repair funds.

<h3 id="e6">Central Government Holds Eighth Anniversary Commemoration of the Purification of the Party; Ye Chucang Reports on Party Purification Work <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held an eighth-anniversary commemoration of the Purification of the Party this morning. Attending were Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Wang Maogong, Gu Zhenggang, Kexing'e, and representatives from various agencies and all staff members, totaling 600 people. Chairman Ju Zheng led the assembly in paying respects, after which Ye Chucang reported, stating that since the Purification of the Party, the Party has been working hard to suppress the communists. The soldiers at the front have never slacked off, and the communist army will be eliminated in the shortest possible time, which is no longer a problem. Therefore, our meeting today to commemorate the Purification of the Party and observe a moment of silence is to express our respect for the late Premier Sun Yat-Sen and the martyrs who died in previous anti-communist campaigns, as well as for the comrades who were killed in the anti-communist struggle. In my opinion, the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees should at this time offer condolences to the anti-communist soldiers at the front. At the same time, all comrades in the rear should actually work hard on the following three tasks in order to assist the soldiers at the front and jointly shoulder the responsibility of quickly eliminating the communist bandits: (1) Strive to revive the countryside, support industry and commerce, develop transportation, and manage water conservancy, in order to enrich the people's livelihood and consolidate the social and economic foundation; (2) Stabilize politics and fully develop the power of the government, so that it can get back on track; (3) Strive to ensure that the people of the whole country have a correct understanding of the party's principles, so that they will not be misled due to hunger and cold. I believe that only in this way can we cut off the communist bandits' future, and only then can the social foundation be consolidated. I offer this for the reference of my fellow comrades.

<p>(London) The Times praised Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist work in today's editorial, saying that it would be absurd to say that the communist bandits, who have held out for six years, would voluntarily give up their strongholds. They are merely breaking out of the encirclement to avoid being annihilated. The Chinese military staff has not yet learned how to use its victory, but for whatever reason, there are still gaps in the encirclement, and the communist bandits have been able to break through and flee into Guizhou Province. But whether they can escape the net is now in question. Chiang Kai-shek has shown his amazing ability to turn defeat into victory. His efforts to rescue 50 million people in Sichuan Province from corrupt bureaucrats and autocratic warlords have already had a significant effect. The consequences of his anti-communist work are not yet visible, but the fact that he travels by plane throughout the west and is welcomed everywhere is enough to show his courage.

Yan Daogang also delivered a speech on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, encouraging them to follow the doctor's instructions, abide by discipline, uphold ethics, and pay attention to cleanliness in order to maintain the highest moral standards and the glorious history of the wounded soldiers. Furthermore, as soon as their wounds heal slightly, they should practice crafts or study literature to find a way to support themselves in the future. The officers and soldiers were all very grateful. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) The Military Affairs Commission issued an instruction to the provincial governments of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi on the 12th, stating: "It has been found that recently, various banks have often used the pretext of granting loans to send personnel to various places to persuade farmers to organize cooperatives. Among them, most are aimed at transferring idle funds from urban areas to help rural areas. However, it is inevitable that some use the loan relationship to make advance agreements at low prices to purchase agricultural products and seize farmers' profits. Some even avoid the supervision of administrative agencies by not using the name of cooperation but creating other names to indiscriminately grant loans in order to manipulate good and weak farmers. If this is not cracked down on immediately, the future of rural cooperation will be difficult to develop in a healthy manner. The provincial governments are instructed to immediately issue a prohibition notice and inform all banks and other lending organizations that when handling loans to rural cooperatives, they should notify the rural cooperative committees of the provinces of the lending regulations and procedures in advance for the record, and report the names and total amounts lent and recovered to the cooperative committees for the record after the event."

<h3 id="e18">Reflections on the US's Further Increase in Silver Prices <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>According to a US telegram on the 10th, President Roosevelt has decided to increase the price of buying domestically produced silver from 64.5 cents per ounce to 71 cents, effective from today. Since the announcement of this news, the world's silver problem has responded accordingly and has seen obvious new developments. The price increase trend started with New York's benchmark price rising from 65.75 cents to 66 cents. In London, on the 11th, the benchmark silver price for immediate delivery rose from 28.9375 pence to 29.6875 pence, and the price for forward delivery rose from 29.0625 pence to 29.8125 pence, creating a nine-year high. In the afternoon, due to US purchases, the silver price rose another 0.25 pence, with the current price at 29.9375 pence and the price for forward delivery at 30.0625 pence. In Japan, the price will be raised by 1.80 yuan to 71.764 yuan.</p>
<p>Since the world's silver market has risen along with the US's further increase in domestic silver prices, looking back at the situation in our country, although the exchange rate has plummeted as a result, the changes in foreign exchange have been very weak, and the balancing tax rate remains at 6.75%. This abnormal phenomenon is puzzling to our people. According to experts, if the recent London silver price is compared with our country's exchange rate against the pound sterling, the difference is about 3.10%. The highest difference last autumn was only 20%. If silver is exported at this time, after deducting all expenses such as export tax, balancing tax, freight, and insurance, the net profit is estimated to be about 11-12%. That is, for every 1 million yuan of silver exported, the net profit is 110,000-120,000 yuan. Compared with last year's net profit of 6-7%, the excellent profit is probably beyond anyone's initial expectations. From this point of view, if our country's silver reserves are not prevented in advance, there will be a continuing trend of reduction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the US silver purchase plan, the silver that needs to be purchased should be based on the existing gold reserves of 8,599,743,000 yuan. Based on the ratio of gold to silver as 3:1, the treasury should have silver reserves worth 2,866,580,000 yuan. However, according to a check, the current silver reserves of the US Treasury are only worth 915,614,000 yuan, which is less than one-third of the set amount. If the Americans insist on their established policy and continue to buy silver, they may end up including our China and India's silver reserves, which may still be insufficient. Our country's monetary system will suffer unprecedented sacrifices in history. It can be said that the US's implementation of a further increase in silver prices has been going on for two days, and our government authorities seem to be still waiting for the development of events. We have not yet heard what countermeasures will be taken. Even the balancing tax rate has not been raised accordingly. In my humble opinion, under this serious situation, effective measures to prevent the continued export of silver reserves must be taken decisively and formulated as soon as possible. If the delay continues, the impact may be far greater than in the past.</p>

<p>Stresa – The leading figures of the three major European powers commenced a meeting here yesterday to discuss various issues related to pacifying Europe. It was firmly declared during yesterday's meeting that regarding France's appeal to the League of Nations concerning Germany's military buildup, the fact that France, Italy, and Britain have jointly presented this matter to the League is no longer in question. The French appeal to the League is solely for French documentation purposes and will not be altered in the meeting.</p>
<p>British Representative Issues Declaration – British representatives MacDonald and Simon yesterday explained to the French and Italian representatives the UK's stance on peace and security issues in detail, expressing Britain's willingness to assist in advancing the European group security system through various practical methods.</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter learned that the British representative issued a declaration stating that the UK is willing to do everything in its power to consolidate the unity agreed upon between Britain, France, and Italy. The British representative declared that no country should feel it is overstepping its bounds for the sake of its own policies. Britain, France, and Italy cannot be separated on matters that can strengthen European peace. The British representative also stated that the British government is currently preparing a disarmament plan and is willing to have it supervised by the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a special correspondent for the Times, British Prime Minister MacDonald made a declaration at the first Stresa meeting yesterday, with the catchphrase, "Britain, France, and Italy share the common goal of safeguarding European peace. It is inconceivable that the three countries would allow themselves to be divided in this endeavor. According to British policy, the League of Nations is the appropriate forum for international negotiations to maintain peace. Britain is prepared to make a substantial contribution to promote collective security." (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Second Day of the Meeting – Stresa – The meeting of Britain, France, and Italy continued this morning at 9:30 AM and concluded at 11:00 AM. The discussions this morning concerned the consequences that might arise from France's application to the League of Nations Council, and the appropriate steps to be taken in the future in the event of further breaches of treaties. After the meeting, a reporter interviewed British Prime Minister MacDonald, asking whether the reported British policy from London was accurate. MacDonald replied, "You should know that the qualified representatives of the British government are present here." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Stresa – When the representatives of Britain, France, and Italy gathered this morning, the primary subject of discussion was the unilateral denial of international obligations. It is heard that the scope of the discussion was quite broad, not solely focused on Germany. Consideration of the French appeal to the League of Nations has been completed, and the recommendations contained in the London communiqué of February 3 will now be studied in detail (i.e., Britain and France both agree on the necessity of maintaining Austria's independence and integrity, and advocate inviting Germany to genuinely cooperate; Britain and France do not regard the unilateral denial of international obligations as right, welcome the conclusion of a European mutual assistance pact, and suggest replacing the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles with an agreement, Germany returning to the League of Nations, and the conclusion of an air pact). The afternoon meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM. In addition to the London communiqué, the agenda also includes Eastern European and Central European pacts. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Hoping Germany Returns to the League of Nations – Stresa – The representatives of Britain, France, and Italy held their second meeting at the Palazzo Borromeo at 9:30 AM this morning. It is heard that they will thoroughly discuss Italy's views. Yesterday, the press and the representatives in attendance discussed the British delegation's memorandum, which was far richer in content than the opinions of other countries. Its conclusion stated that the main purpose of Britain's participation in the Stresa conference is to promote Germany's return to the League of Nations. However, Prime Minister MacDonald also stated that inviting Germany to participate in the Stresa conference at this time would be unwise. This declaration is tantamount to an informal denial of the suggestion to invite Germany, Poland, and Soviet Russia to a six-nation conference. Summarizing the news before today's meeting, all three countries seem to hope that Germany will return to the League of Nations, but Britain has expressed this more clearly than Italy and France. (National Telegram, 12th) Although there are various rumors circulating regarding the Stresa conference, it is confirmed that yesterday's meeting focused on the following three items:</p>
<p>(1) The possibility of Germany's return to the League of Nations; (2) The independence of Austria; (3) To ensure that the clauses of the League of Nations Covenant regarding dealing with aggressors are implemented promptly when relevant situations arise, thereby strengthening the Covenant. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Main Topics of Discussion the Day Before – The majority of the time during yesterday's meeting was spent on France's appeal to the League of Nations, and this led to the issue of Germany's return to the League of Nations being mentioned. The British side believes that this should not be conditional, as imposing conditions may be unhelpful and even harmful.</p>
<p>The issue of an Eastern European pact, along with France and Russia's recent understanding, was also thoroughly studied. It is heard that the possibility of Germany joining this pact was not discussed.</p>
<p>Friendly Atmosphere of the Talks – Yesterday afternoon's discussion lasted for two and a half hours. According to Italian sources, the atmosphere was very friendly. The general sentiment among the British here is that the meeting has made a good start, and there are no differences of opinion among the three countries in principle. The meeting may have to be extended to Saturday or Sunday, which is seen here as a sign that the discussions have revealed something of definite value. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Basic Policy Towards Germany – The Three Countries Agree – Stresa – It was learned today that Britain, France, and Italy have agreed not to allow any event to hinder the joint action of the three countries towards Germany. The three countries feel that if there are any differences of opinion on basic policy, they will fall into Germany's trap. Therefore, there will be no modification to the document that France sent to the League of Nations requesting a thorough discussion of Germany's abandonment of the Treaty of Versailles. Furthermore, it has been learned from reliable sources that Germany, Poland, and Soviet Russia will also be invited to send representatives to attend the meeting here, and the current talks will be a preparatory meeting. It is heard that Britain has managed to prevent France and Italy from taking drastic measures against Germany this morning.</p>
<p>Communique Issued After the Meeting – The Italian government issued a communiqué last night, reporting on the situation of the first meeting, stating only that, "British Prime Minister MacDonald briefly outlined Britain's foreign policy this morning. Afterwards, British Foreign Secretary Simon reported on his tour of Europe and described Germany's attitude towards the Danube Pact, the Eastern European Pact, the Air Defense Mutual Assistance Pact, and the League of Nations. In the afternoon meeting, the French representative explained the reasons for his report to the League of Nations and presented the plans he hoped to take."</p>
<p>Reasons for France's Appeal to the League of Nations – The three-country meeting opened at 10:30 AM yesterday morning. The French representative first presented France's document to the League of Nations. The document, which is likely to be released on Monday, is very pessimistic in tone. Although it does not predict war, it emphasizes the seriousness of the crisis and believes that it can still be resolved if efforts are made. The document was submitted by French Foreign Minister Laval to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Prime Minister MacDonald, but was not requested for their approval, and therefore is purely a French plan that does not require the consent of other countries. However, Laval also stated that he very much wanted other countries to know the reasons stated in the document, because if other countries followed Germany's actions, the results would be unimaginable. Subsequently, Foreign Secretary Simon spoke about the results of his tour of various countries' capitals and answered the questions of Mussolini, Laval, and French Prime Minister Flandin. The French representative continued, saying that their impression of the meeting was very good.</p>
<p>Points Demanded by Italy and France – Afterwards, the representatives of the three countries discussed the French document in detail and learned that France and Italy had asked Britain to restrain Germany. The plans of France and Italy include the following points:</p>
<p>(1) France demands that if Germany violates the Treaty of Versailles again, it should be punished.</p>
<p>(2) France and Italy insist that the demilitarization of the Rhineland and the independence of Austria must not be violated.</p>
<p>(3) France and Italy demand that the scope of the Locarno Treaty be expanded, with the addition of a Danube Treaty, including countries such as Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Austria, and Hungary.</p>
<p>(4) France demands that the League of Nations Council condemn Germany's violation of the treaty. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Statement from the British Government</p>
<p>(London) Officials fear that the outside world will have the wrong impression of the opinions expressed by the British representative in Stresa yesterday, so they stated today that since the British representative set off for Stresa, Britain has not made any new decisions or issued any formal new announcements.

<p>(Paris) According to a special correspondent for this agency in Stresa, the ministers of Britain, France, and Italy held a meeting this morning, most of the time was spent by the British representative presenting a report on the proposal to invite Germany, Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Foreign Secretary Simon also explained the purpose of this trip, which was to study whether Germany can still cooperate in the cause of European peace. As for Britain's attitude towards this meeting, it is nothing more than the following: (1) The countries participating in the meeting have an obligation to show a relationship of solidarity, and Britain is prepared to do everything in its power to show that spirit of solidarity; (2) Within the scope of the League of Nations, a collective security system should be organized, and Britain is willing to support it with real strength in various practical forms; (3) The cause of peace must be organized, and the method of organization is to determine and supervise the ratio of each country's armaments; (4) Britain is still willing to respect the Rome Four-Power Pact of July 15, 1933, but in the current situation, the relationship of solidarity between Britain, France, and Italy, and the power of the League of Nations should be taken as the basis for action; (5) Britain wishes Germany to return to the League of Nations, but in the current situation, it is not appropriate to allow it to rejoin unconditionally, so as not to create an extremely bad precedent. At this point, French Foreign Minister Laval explained France's application to the League of Nations for Germany's rearmament. It is heard that Britain and Italy will definitely support it in the future. It is rumored that after the end of the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council on the 15th of this month, a meeting will be held again in Stresa, and Germany will be invited to participate. This statement has been denied by French officials. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) Yesterday's telegram stated that Prime Minister MacDonald, after attending the Stresa conference, planned to go to Geneva to attend the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council to be held on the 15th. According to the Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent in Stresa, the Prime Minister has decided not to go to Geneva. The Daily News reporter believes that the British delegation to the Stresa meeting is now insisting that Germany must participate in any international conference held after the end of the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council. The Daily Herald also believes that although Germany is currently refusing to participate in the mutual assistance pact, the British cabinet believes that the country will definitely reconsider this attitude. The newspaper also said that Britain will continue to work hard to persuade Germany to comply and explore the true purpose of German policy. In addition, The Times mentioned an article published in the Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia yesterday, stating that it is not impossible to convene a second international conference and conclude a six-nation pact between Britain, France, Italy, Russia, Germany, and Poland. (According to an article published in the Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia yesterday, it stated that in the near future, it is possible to invite Russia, Germany, and Poland to hold another international conference with Britain, France, and Italy.) It also said that France's wish is to fully clarify what measures should be taken to deal with Germany if it violates the Treaty of Versailles again and what their nature should be. In other words, it would be in accordance with the League of Nations regulations on page 9.</p>

<p>Stresa – Well-informed circles today commented on Italy's opinion that there may be a larger international conference in the near future, in which Germany, Poland, and Soviet Russia will be invited to participate, saying that this is only music in the air, and pleasant music at that. Although all Italian newspapers this morning regarded any concrete decision on this matter as wishful thinking, according to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, all parties in Stresa feel that this kind of meeting may soon be realized, and the meeting place may be in London, especially because Italy and Britain have apparently had a close understanding in the last 24 hours. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Rome – After the commentary written by Il Popolo d'Italia on Thursday was published, all the evening newspapers reprinted it. According to the Fascist newspaper Il Tevere, it is still doubtful whether Germany, Poland, and Soviet Russia will be invited to participate in the Stresa conference. Although France has expressed opposition to Germany, Britain still has considerable influence. As for what Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said, Italy now has 600,000 soldiers wielding weapons and the latest weapons, which is enough to express Italy's position. Therefore, Italy can wait calmly for any changes in the international situation without fear. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) According to information obtained from responsible sources, the British cabinet now supports the conclusion of a pact similar to the French-Russian agreement, and believes that this kind of pact is a good foundation for a collective security organization. However, before the final decision is made to conclude this kind of pact, Britain must understand whether Germany is truly willing to participate in the collective security system. If, after various efforts, Britain is still unable to get Germany to participate in the security system, then Britain will not oppose the conclusion of an agreement to protect the security of the countries concerned. In addition, responsible sources solemnly stated that Britain, in any case, does not want to be subject to any new constraints on the European continent, but Britain will definitely support the Locarno Treaty and the mutual assistance pact proposed in the London Declaration of February 7.

<p>Stresa – An Associated Press reporter learned that France will insist within the League of Nations on sanctioning Germany's unilateral actions in violating the treaty, and will demand the stipulation of several kinds of sanctions. French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval are currently studying these sanction measures, but it is heard that these sanctions may not be military in nature, but rather an economic sanction that League of Nations member states can unanimously impose on Germany, according to the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French reporters now believe that French Prime Minister Flandin will take a tough stance against Germany at the Stresa conference. Le Matin now believes that the French representative will ask for a formal declaration that Germany has violated the treaty. Flandin intends to suggest that a common attitude be taken in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. If Germany continues to violate the Treaty of Versailles, Britain, France, and Italy should impose financial and economic sanctions on Germany. A reporter for Paris-Soir claims that the French and Italian representatives have already agreed on this course of action at the Stresa conference. According to the French account of the situation at the Stresa meeting today, French Foreign Minister Laval explained the reasons why France requested that the League of Nations Council convene a meeting because of Germany's decision to implement compulsory military service. It is said that the League of Nations Council's approval of the resolution endorsing France's appeal, without explicitly mentioning Germany or imposing any sanctions on Germany, is sufficient as a moral condemnation to be imposed on Germany. Because the general public was quite optimistic about the Stresa conference, the price of government bonds suddenly rebounded on the stock exchange today. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Paris) After the first day of work at the Stresa conference, all the newspapers expressed optimism about the future of the conference, believing that the solidarity between Britain, France, and Italy has been effectively demonstrated, and British Prime Minister MacDonald also believes that Germany's unconditional return to the League of Nations is a matter that can be considered. Le Petit Parisien reported, "All countries that love peace must establish a barrier to prevent Germany from violating the treaty again, such as economic and financial sanctions." Le Matin reported, "A country that violates a treaty should be regarded as an aggressor. Economic and financial sanctions suitable for aggressors are also applicable to countries that violate the treaty." L'Écho de Paris said, "The question we should pay attention to is whether France and Italy can conclude a treaty similar to the French-Russian agreement, so that France and Italy can reach an agreement on Central Europe with the countries of the Little Entente, and that it is tolerated by Britain." L'Intransigeant said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is heard to have proposed that France and Italy form a military agreement, and has also promised to form the same agreement with the countries of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente. Regarding this matter, the French government has authorized Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval to act as they see fit. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) By the evening of the 12th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received an official telegram regarding the progress of the Britain, France, and Italy meeting in Stresa, Italy. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to take a quiet observation policy. In the recent situation, Japan and the United States are paying attention to East Asia and the Americas. As for the problems of Europe, they should also be resolved between the European countries. If the situation in Europe, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Stresa conference, is gradually returning to the dangerous state before the Great War, then countries outside Europe should not participate, and the problem should be limited to Europe.

<p>(Geneva) The Ethiopian government sent a note to the Secretariat of the League of Nations on March 29 regarding the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, stating that direct negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia had broken down and requesting that the matter be submitted to arbitration. Today, the Italian government telegraphed the Secretariat of the League of Nations, refuting the Ethiopian note, saying that direct negotiations between the governments of Italy and Ethiopia are still ongoing. The allegations in the Ethiopian note are mostly inaccurate or harbor ulterior motives. However, Italy does not want to argue to avoid causing unnecessary controversy. Furthermore, on January 19 of this year, Italy and Ethiopia exchanged notes, agreeing that disputes between the two countries would be submitted to conciliation or arbitration in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Italian-Ethiopian treaty of August 2, 1928. However, after the Italian-Ethiopian treaty of 1928 was signed, the notes exchanged between the two countries stated that if a dispute arose that should be submitted to arbitration, then the governments of both countries should each appoint two arbitrators to arbitrate it. Therefore, the Italian government now intends to directly notify the Ethiopian government, expressing Italy's readiness to take the above-mentioned measures jointly with the Ethiopian government in order to achieve a final resolution to the dispute between the two countries.

<h3 id="e31">World Silver Price Could Stabilize in Months: Pittman's Speech to the U.S. Senate; Silver Movement in U.S. Congress Intensifies <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Pittman stated in a Senate speech today that the Treasury's increase in domestic silver prices is solid evidence of the government's intention to implement the silver purchase law. Pittman, a leader of the silver faction and former U.S. representative who signed the London Silver Agreement, said today that the Treasury's action yesterday was President Roosevelt's response to those who generally believed he would not implement the silver purchase law. He also stated that, according to figures released by the Treasury, the President purchased 50 million ounces of silver each month, so there is no basis for criticizing the Treasury for saying that the government's silver purchases have slowed down. Pittman predicted that the world silver price could stabilize in a few months, and all problems could be resolved. It is believed here that the Treasury's increase in the domestic silver price from 64.5 cents to 71.11 cents is very important, as this move is indicative of the government's future monetary policy and the possibility of free coinage of silver. Some observers predict that when the silver price rises to $1.29 per ounce, free coinage of silver will be implemented, and the Treasury will not charge coinage taxes at that time. The leaders of the silver faction are still trying to raise the silver price. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has issued a warning, intending to prevent them from changing the current law through radical means. Morgenthau sent a letter to Democratic Senator McCarran, saying that if Congress disrupts the executive branch's power over gold and silver, the national currency system will be endangered. As for the source of Morgenthau's letter, it was because McCarran had proposed abolishing the provision in the silver purchase law that authorized the government to control or prohibit cash transactions and imports and exports. In addition, Senator Thomas, a leader of the silver faction in the Senate, also stated that although the silver faction was very pleased with the Treasury's increase in the silver price, they still intended to fight hard for Wheeler's proposal. Today, the Senate Agriculture Committee passed the bill, ordering the government to purchase 50 million ounces of silver per month until the silver price became sixteen to one against gold. The case was handled by the Agriculture Committee because its purpose was to relieve agriculture and livestock. In fact, it was also a tactic, as this would avoid being blocked by the more conservative Banking and Currency Committee. As for the content of the Wheeler Act, the Treasury must issue warehouse receipts for all the silver purchased. This expansionary proposal is opposed by the government. The Treasury announced this morning that in the past year, it has purchased 413,500,000 ounces of silver. As of March 27, the total amount of silver held by the Treasury was 1,104,500,000 ounces, while before the Silver Purchase Act was passed on May 25 last year, it was only 691,482,085 ounces. The Treasury estimates that the total value of all silver ingots and silver coins is $1,450,000,000, half of which was secretly purchased by the Treasury in the world silver market with a balance fund of $200 million. When the government nationalized silver last year, it obtained another 112,594,155 ounces, and the silver produced domestically reached 32,611,000 ounces. However, the Treasury still lacks 100 million ounces to achieve the goal of gold to silver reserves of three to one. (National Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Members of Congress are now closely watching the silver situation, wanting to see whether President Roosevelt's action of raising the Treasury's silver purchase price will curb or promote this movement. However, the silver movement is now flourishing again. The most prominent is Wheeler's silver coin bill, which advocates minting silver coins at a ratio of sixteen to one with gold. This bill was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee today, but it is expected that the Senate will strongly oppose it. The actions of the committee and yesterday's developments have made the Congressional silver faction more active. Although the Senate leader is confident that the bill will not pass, the initiator, Wheeler, said that he will definitely get more votes of approval than before. Senator Pittman stated today that President Roosevelt's announcement has shown that he is eagerly fulfilling the terms of the London Silver Agreement and the Silver Purchase Act. Senator Tom has sent letters to prominent economists and financiers, predicting that countries still on the gold standard will soon abandon the gold standard, and then the world currency can be stabilized on a bimetallic basis. The more gold and silver the United States stores, the more dominant its position in controlling and stabilizing the world currency price will be. The world silver market is now rising in price. The New York large bar was listed at 65.75 cents, and then rose to 66 cents. Western mining is extremely happy due to increased subsidies. Public opinion generally believes that silver is mostly a by-product of mining. Before silver production increases, the price of other metals will inevitably increase. They predict that the future silver price will definitely be $1.29, but the final possible price depends on Washington's final decision and various factors, the main one being whether most of the silver hoarded in the Far East can be attracted to the market by a good price. According to currency experts, current developments do not have special inflationary properties, but if this procedure is actively carried out for a long period of time, there is a high possibility of inflation. They predict that the pressure from the Congressional silver faction to raise the silver price may not decrease until the silver price is close to $1.29. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Some sources say that President Roosevelt raised the silver price as a preemptive defense, fearing that the silver faction would make more severe demands. However, Wall Street people do not believe this statement, saying that even if the Treasury is unwilling to fully implement the silver program, the silver faction has indeed succeeded in making the authorities pay attention to the terms of the silver purchase act. However, if the Treasury's gold reserves increase day by day, and the amount of silver reserves cannot increase at the same rate, then the silver program will not be possible to implement. According to news from the Treasury today, the monetary value of the silver stored by the Treasury, including large bar silver coins and silver coins in circulation, is $145 million. Therefore, to achieve a gold to silver ratio of three to one, it is necessary to purchase another $142.1 million in silver. According to the Treasury's recent report, the gold it holds is currently worth $861.4 million. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

British knitwear industry workers have also made requests, but the government does not take restricting or prohibiting the import of goods as a policy.

<h3 id="e83">A Record of Inspection in the Northwest: The Livelihood of the People in Longde and the Strategic Importance of Sanguankou <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Leaving the eastern city of Jingning and winding through the Eastern Gorge, we arrived at Longde County, 38 kilometers away. The willows along the way, continuously in sight, were planted by Zuo Zongtang when he supervised Shaanxi twenty years ago. Commonly known as "Lord Zuo's Willows," they have a commemorative meaning. The trees are mostly more than one arm's length thick and two or three lengths tall, spaced three or four steps apart, forming rows along the road. In summer, the branches and leaves provide shade, benefiting travelers greatly. We passed forty or fifty refugees, men, women, old and young, hunching over, carrying and supporting each other, walking slowly on the muddy road. Upon inquiry, we learned that they were from Hejian and Xian County in Hebei Province. In recent years, the Hutuo River flooded, and the fields and houses were turned into a lake. They originally intended to go to the Northeast, but because it was difficult to leave the pass, they decided to go west to Jiayuguan to cultivate land and make a living. From their home to here, they have been walking for two months. The oldest is 68 years old, and the youngest is only four months old. They beg for food and assistance along the way, dividing it equally according to shares. Those over ten years old get a full share, and those under nine get half a share. They have the ancient tradition of sharing joys and sorrows and are as close as family. However, carrying the old and leading the young, they travel only twenty or thirty miles a day. Reaching their destination may be after the rainy season.</p>
<p>The city of Longde is backed by high mountains and is large and difficult to defend. From 1926 to 1931, bandits captured the city eleven times. The city walls collapsed, and the people's houses were desolate. Whenever there is a disturbance, few soldiers cannot defend it, and many soldiers cannot be supported. Relying on the city is also unreliable. The entire county covers about 9,000 square miles, divided into twenty-one forts, with a population of about 60,000. The annual miscellaneous silver is more than 3,400 yuan, and the grain is more than 700 dan. There are two higher primary schools, one with more than 160 students and one with more than 220 students. There is one model elementary school with 70+ students. There are twenty-six village elementary schools, totaling less than 300 students. Students have no cotton clothes in winter and must help with farm work in summer. In reality, the number of students attending class often differs from the enrollment. Teachers' annual salaries of 20 yuan are also quite meager. The people's livelihood is such that they commonly cook thin yellow millet porridge with the husks on, and stir-fried noodles made from oats and wheat. The price of goods is such that one yuan can buy two dou of yellow millet, or three dou of naked oats, three dou and five sheng of oats (each dou of wheat weighs 30 catties), six and a half catties of meat, and eight or nine catties of salt. Although it is said to be not expensive, they cannot afford it. About two-thirds of the people still wear single pants in winter. Many children of several years old are especially naked without pants, and babies are even held in their clothes. The clothes are tattered, and the babies' purple and red frozen legs are often exposed. In the night, it is difficult to find one family out of a hundred with bedding. Most people huddle around the stove and sleep on the kang (brick bed) to get through the night. I once asked several farmers if they had cotton quilts for warmth. One replied, "We don't even have chopsticks, how can we have quilts?" The words were sorrowful, and nothing could be more so. However, the reason why the farmers are so poor is not because they are lazy or the land is barren, but because military requisitions and miscellaneous taxes are too heavy, and they have already been completely exploited. For example, in the neighboring county of Gangu, there was no rain all year round last year, but the allocated requisitions still reached 200,000 yuan. With the amount exceeding the allocation for four years in one year, how can the farmers bear it? It is found that in the Qing Dynasty, Gansu relied entirely on subsidies from various provinces. Since the subsidies were cut off, the income and expenditure were far from sufficient. Those in charge of accounting and administration could not cope, so they used the requisition system for turnover. The authorities once considered abolishing the requisition system to unify finances, but due to the special circumstances, it has not been resolved. Moreover, the financial difficulties of the provinces are actually due to the excessive inter-provincial support of military expenditures. The heavy military expenditures in recent years, especially in eastern Gansu, often led to spending tomorrow's grain today, so that the requisitions in each county exceeded the allocated amount. If this trend continues, it will inevitably follow the example of Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>I stayed overnight in Longde. The next morning, I departed east and arrived at Yangjia Shop, 9 kilometers away, at the foot of Liupan Mountain. From here, I climbed up the mountain in twists and turns, with more than a dozen turns. The power lines run straight up the winding road. Although there are high poles to support them, the power lines are so low and sloped that they almost touch the mountain surface. The steepness of the mountain slope can be imagined. It took seven or eight kilometers (commonly known as fifteen li each up and down) to reach the top of the mountain. The grass is vigorous, the stone layers are scarlet, and the peaks are surrounded like stars surrounding the throne. However, the clouds and mist in the valley bottom make it impossible to look down. Han Qi of the Song Dynasty defeated Yuan Wu of the Western Xia Dynasty here. Emperor Genghis Khan of the Yuan Dynasty repeatedly avoided the summer heat on Liupan Mountain and is said to have died here on his way back west. He is buried in the mountain, and there is still a tomb without a stele in the territory of Guyuan. Descending the eastern foothills, the slopes wind left and right for more than twenty turns, six or seven kilometers long. Halfway up the mountain is a Guandi Temple, but there is no forest scenery at all. Lord Zuo's willows are planted on the west side and in the middle of the mountain, while on the east side, they end at the foot of the mountain. Down the mountain is a village called Monk Shop, the former site of He Shang Yuan, which was guarded by the Song envoy Wu Jie. A clear stream flows beside the village, which is one of the sources of the Jing River. The road follows the stream, and six kilometers to the Wating Post. When Kui Xiao of the Han Dynasty heard that Luoyang had fallen, he sent Niu Han to guard this place. He also set up a stronghold here when he came, named Wating Pass. The castle is towering and has a commanding position. From here, Lord Zuo's willows stretch continuously. The porcelain bowls of the power lines are occasionally nailed to them, which is very convenient. The water flow gradually increases, and the mountain cliffs on both banks are steep, dangerous, and strangely shaped. About eight or nine kilometers away, two peaks face each other, with a line running through the middle. The cliffs flank the water, which is about ten feet wide. The rushing torrents are abundant and heroic. A stone bridge is inscribed with the words "Second Pass," also known as Jinfo Gorge. There is a Guandi Temple beside the mountain, and there is also a statue of Yang Yanzhao, commonly known as the Sixth Son Temple. A few steps east of the bridge, there are three or four houses, and there is a "Former Residence of Dong Shao Bao" stele. After ascending a gentle slope, we arrived at HaoDian Town. From Wating to the town, the canyon is eleven and a half kilometers long. In ancient times, it was Danzheng Gorge. During the Tang Dynasty, it was the boundary with Tubo. Its importance for offense and defense can be imagined. East of Liupan Mountain, dozens of wild pheasants can be seen in groups, lying on the ground facing the sun. They are not startled by passing vehicles. HaoDian Town has more than a hundred residents. Seeing the Guyuan branch card of the Anti-Opium Rehabilitation Bureau, I knew that it was not the territory of Pingliang. Sixteen kilometers to Pingliang County City. The streets are wide and tidy, and the city is crowded, making it a large county in eastern Gansu. The inn where I stayed overnight was also more satisfactory than the previous stations, which did not even have doors and windows.</p>

<p>Correspondence from Hankou: The border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Anhui has been plagued by banditry for a long time, and the people have been displaced. Now that the bandits have been suppressed, but the people have not been settled, and the land lies barren, without anyone to cultivate it. The Garrison Headquarters of the Military Committee has repeatedly received reports from various parties, fearing that the spring plowing will be delayed and the people will become more displaced. The government of the three provinces has been strictly ordered to instruct the administrative heads of the border areas to properly enlist and pacify people to return to farming, and to consider the three aspects of preservation, nourishment and education. The order said, "It has been found that the border area of Henan, Hubei and Anhui has been plagued by bandits for a long time, with fields and gardens lying barren and houses in ruins. Since our army's advance to suppress them, the major bandit gangs have been suppressed, but the people in various places have either been threatened by the bandits and scattered to other places, or fear that the bandits will return after the troops leave, suffering another catastrophe, or are unable to move forward due to lack of food and clothing. As a result, only the old and weak remain in the recovered bandit areas, and the displaced people are everywhere, with no way to settle them. Thinking of the future, I cannot help but feel deeply saddened. The Garrison Headquarters has repeatedly received reports from various parties that the counties in the border area are devastated, with no one to cultivate the land and a famine looming. With spring plowing imminent, if preparations are not made early, how can we revitalize the countryside and pacify the people? Now that the major bandit gangs have been wiped out, there is no need to worry about the remnant bandits. In addition to ordering the garrison troops in the border area to thoroughly suppress the remnant bandits in conjunction with the military and civilians in accordance with the "Spiritual Transformation Plan for the Military and Civilians" promulgated by the former Nanchang Garrison Headquarters, the provincial governments should be ordered to immediately follow the "Plan for Reorganizing the Baojia and Suppressing Remnant Bandits in the Bandit Areas" and refer to the regulations of Jiangxi for revising and recruiting the displaced people in various counties, strictly instructing the administrative heads of the border areas to earnestly handle the matter. How to inform the people to return to farming, organize the people to defend themselves, settle the people to enjoy their work, support the people to produce, and guide the people to be virtuous, should all be carefully discussed and properly implemented, so as to consider the three aspects of preservation, nourishment and education, so that spring plowing will not be delayed and the people will not be displaced. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>In recent days, news of the military expedition against bandits in Sichuan and Guizhou has been frequently heard and has been very smooth. Xu bandits of Northern Sichuan are now in the area west of the Jialing River, engaged in fierce fighting with Deng Xihou's troops. Deng's troops won victories in the battles of Sanlei Dam and the upper reaches of the Baihe River at Chaba Meizi Dam, Guanyin Hall, Ganxi River, Phoenix Mountain, Maming Temple, Maling Temple, and Wushu Post. They are now in contact with Hu Zongnan's division to jointly block and suppress the bandits. The Fifth Route Army has recovered the two cities of Nanjiang and Tongjiang. The Third and Fourth Route Armies have also been ordered to sweep across the eastern bank of the Jialing River. There are currently no traces of bandits, and the remnant forces of Xu bandits are surrounded and can be expected to be eliminated. The Guizhou bandits who crossed the Wujiang River were also defeated by the National Army. According to Li Shizeng, who passed through Hankou the day before, the situation in that area is very smooth due to President Chiang's stationing and supervision. Chiang is determined to eliminate the remnant bandits and will not leave until the military affairs have come to an end. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Thirty-Three Counties in Jiangxi Have Been Lifted From Blockade, and the Provincial Government Has Issued an Order to Restore Free Trade. <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Nanchang: The blockade of various places in Jiangxi Province has been in effect for several years. The circulation and purchase of oil, salt, kerosene, and daily necessities have all been subject to unified control and restrictions. At this moment the bandits in various places have been put down gradually. Apart from new recovery areas and areas connected to new recovery areas, and remote complex regions where there are still remaining bandits that are yet to be pacified, the inland area has been entirely cleared up. The provincial government recently followed the orders of the Garrison Headquarters and lifted the blockade on thirty-three counties, including Jiujiang, Linchuan, Dongxiang, and Jinxian, restoring free trade. Previous public sales and salt purchase tickets have been abolished. However, salt shipments of more than 100 catties still require the issuance of mystery permits by the local government to prevent them from flowing into neighboring bandit areas, so as to show strict enforcement. The regions that have not been pacified will continue to tighten the blockade, such as Yudu, Huichang, Dexing, Hengfeng, Tonggu and other counties, where oil and salt are still sold publicly.

<h3 id="e86">Japanese Consuls in Xiamen and Fuzhou Crack Down on Illegal Activities by Taiwanese Residents, Limiting the Time for Gambling Dens to Close and Requiring Registration of Weapons <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Xiamen: Since November, Japan's policy towards Fujian has undergone some changes. The most obvious example is the crackdown by the Japanese consuls in Xiamen and Fuzhou on illegal activities by Taiwanese people. Previously, after the commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Foreign Dispatch Fleet, Hyakutake Gengo, visited Xiamen, the Japanese consul in Xiamen, Tsukamoto Takeshi, issued two orders: (1) Crack down on gambling dens set up by Taiwanese people in Xiamen, requiring them to close down completely by the end of April. From May 1st onwards, Taiwanese people are not allowed to operate any gambling dens. (2) Crack down on the possession of weapons by Taiwanese people, ordering them to register all weapons at the Japanese consulate for inspection before March 15th. At the same time, those carrying guns are required to register with the Xiamen Public Security Bureau. (3) Taiwanese people are not allowed to operate small pawnshops without the permission of the Japanese consulate or to receive any mortgages. The gambling dens have gradually been closed down in accordance with the order, but the result will be that several thousand Taiwanese vagrants who make a living in the gambling dens will lose their jobs. Someone suggested that after the gambling dens are closed, the four major clubs, namely the Paper Weaving and Four Major Clubs, should accommodate the unemployed Taiwanese people. The Japanese consul has not yet allowed it. The Japanese consulate has already implemented the registration of firearms, and the Public Security Bureau has also issued a notice limiting the time for registration. As for opium dens, since the Anti-Opium Bureau already has regulations, they only need to comply with them, so there is no order to close them down. In addition, regarding the investigation of bandits, in the past, it was necessary to conduct searches of Taiwanese residences in conjunction with Japanese police. Recently, due to the Haihou Maoji robbery case, the Public Security Bureau can directly execute searches of foreign firms and arrest Taiwanese people before extraditing them. These are the recent developments of the Japanese in Xiamen. In Fuzhou, the Japanese consul, Usami, has also recently taken similar steps to Xiamen. At the end of March, he ordered the Taiwanese Association of Fuzhou to instruct the gambling dens opened by Taiwanese people to close down completely from April 1st. Opium dens should follow the regulations promulgated by the Chinese authorities and obtain licenses from the Anti-Opium Bureau. The Taiwanese people also requested permission to keep four gambling dens, specializing in Pai Gow and Fan Tan, to make a living, but the Japanese consul did not allow it. April 1st was the date for the implementation of the closure. The Japanese consul specially dispatched Japanese police to inspect the gambling dens to see if they were complying with the order to close down. However, it is said that they have indeed stopped during the day, but there is still a lot of gambling at night. In Fuzhou and Xiamen, there are fewer Taiwanese people in Fuzhou than in Xiamen, only a few thousand, and their residence is limited to the Cangshan area, so it is easier to crack down. In Xiamen, there are many Taiwanese people, about 20,000, and they are scattered in various streets and lanes throughout the city, so it is more difficult to crack down. Although the Japanese consuls in Fuzhou and Xiamen have made this statement, the actual result of the implementation is still unpredictable. (April 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Fujian Province: Agricultural Relief Plan to be Handled with the Assistance of the Farmers Bank <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Previously, in order to provide relief to the rural villages in the counties that were afflicted by the bandits, the Fujian Provincial Government especially established the Rural Finance Relief Office. It collaborated with the Fuzhou branch of the Chinese Farmers Bank, and the relief office dispatched personnel to various counties to establish loan offices, guide farmers in various villages to organize mutual aid societies, and borrow money from the loan offices to lend to the members to buy farm implements, seeds, and fertilizer. The money released by the loan offices was borrowed from the Farmers Bank by the Relief Office. Since the implementation of the plan, it has had remarkable results. A total of 52 mutual aid societies were established in Minhou County, with loans of 20,000 yuan. In Fuqing County, 63 mutual aid societies were established, with loans of 20,000 yuan. In Shaowu County, 68 mutual aid societies were established, with loans of 15,000 yuan. In Changle County, 45 mutual aid societies were established, with loans of 15,000 yuan. In Chong'an County, 32 mutual aid societies were established, with loans of 10,000 yuan. In Shunchang County, 50 mutual aid societies were established, with loans of 10,000 yuan. In Pucheng County, 38 mutual aid societies were established, with loans of 10,000 yuan. The total amount of loans issued has reached 100,000 yuan. Now that the spring plowing is beginning, the farmers are in urgent need of money, and the amount of loans released by the Farmers Bank has been exhausted. Last month, the director of the Relief Office, Mr. Huo, and the manager of the branch, Mr. Shen, went to Hankou together to contact the head office for an increase in the loan amount and to promote the rural farmers' relief efforts. As a result, they were quite successful. It is now reported that the head office has agreed to expand the Fuzhou branch into a branch office, in order to raise its status and assist the pawn industry. A farmers' pledge office will be established, specializing in financial turnover institutions for farmers. Objects will be pledged at the lowest interest rate. At the same time, it will cooperate with the government to establish agricultural warehouses, allowing farmers to deposit grain in the warehouses after the harvest and redeem it at the original price when there is a shortage of grain. The above-mentioned aspects of rural economic relief are all passive aspects. The active aspects of improving farmers' technology and developing agricultural production are the responsibility of the Construction Bureau. The Construction Bureau is planning to establish a provincial agricultural test site in Quanzhou, and an electric irrigation bureau in Changle. The construction has already begun, and Xinghua has been designated as a sugar industry revival test area. A loan of 100,000 yuan has been obtained from the banking group to improve the variety of sugar cane and sugar production. A tea research institute will be established in Sandu to guide tea farmers in Fuding to improve tea planting and tea production. Meteorological observation stations will be established in Nanping, Pucheng, and Changting to be used for agricultural purposes. The Education Department will be consulted to move the provincial Fuzhou Advanced Agricultural School to Zhangzhou, the agricultural center of southern Fujian, in order to adapt to the environment and seek development.

<h3 id="e88">The New Life Movement Promotion Association Issues the Organizational Outline of the Labor Service Corps and the Preliminary Implementation Plan for the "Three Transformations" of Life <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Nanchang: The New Life Movement Promotion Association recently issued a notice to the New Life Movement Promotion Associations in various places, attaching the "Organizational Outline of the New Life Labor Service Corps" and the "Preliminary Implementation Plan for the Militarization, Industrialization, and Artification of Life." The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e89">Announcement <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Since its inception last year, the New Life Movement has primarily focused on "order" and "cleanliness" as the central tasks of its first phase. Fortunately, with the concerted efforts and enthusiastic promotion of various dignitaries and compatriots nationwide, the perception of this movement and the awareness of "order" and "cleanliness" have deeply penetrated people's hearts, gradually becoming a prevailing trend. With a solid foundation established, progress is promising. Future work should not only maintain and enrich past achievements but also further promote advancement. Now, to adapt to the needs of our nation and develop the vitality of our people, to realize the three major principles of militarization, productionization, and artification as outlined in the New Life Movement's guidelines within the daily lives of all compatriots nationwide, and to achieve the rationalization of national life, we have specially formulated preliminary implementation plans for the militarization, productionization, and artification of life. All kinds of New Life Movement work activity groups are uniformly reorganized into labor service corps. The central goal of this year's New Life Movement is to promote various tasks in the three-pronged plan with the spirit of labor service. The main tasks include: (1) implementing public training and organization, (2) promoting the organization of social cooperative enterprises, and (3) intensifying the popularization of various social educations. The organization of labor service corps should be based on public officials, school teachers and students, and leaders of various industries. They should engage in work utilizing spare time after official duties, classes, work, or during other holidays. Our association will formulate organizational outlines and send them out together with the preliminary implementation plan of the three-pronged approach. It is hoped that you will refer to and consider the local conditions, properly draft implementation plans and detailed implementation plans, as well as various organizational rules for the labor service corps, and submit them to the association for review. The overall goal is to be thorough, detailed, and practical for implementation, and then gradually promote them, so that this central movement can deeply penetrate the people, achieve remarkable results, and solidify the foundation of the country with the development of the New Life Movement. The future of the nation truly depends on it. President Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Organizational Outline of the New Life Labor Service Corps <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, our country has experienced natural disasters and man-made calamities, internal troubles and foreign invasions. Poverty and crises have reached an extreme. Everything is waiting to be revived, but cannot be revived. Everything is waiting to be started, but cannot be started. The reason is due to the declining national spirit, the dispirited morale, the love of ease and aversion to work, the greed for food and laziness, harming others for personal gain, abusing public office for private benefit, and a lack of the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. Those who can respect public morals, pay attention to group life, strive and sacrifice for the nation, and diligently serve the society and the people are rare. As a result, the 400 million people have become a pile of loose sand and have completely lost the power of independence and autonomy. All nations in the world today take the entire strength as the unit of competition for survival. However, our nation alone is living in a drunken dream and sleeping soundly in selfish individualism. How can we not be sacrificed by the power of the times? If we want to change the atmosphere and revive the nation as a plan to save the country and ourselves, we can only awaken the people, take labor as our duty, take service as our purpose, not spare our own sweat and blood, support our own country, not fear difficulties and dangers, not be afraid of hard work, and then organize the people, promote education, relieve unemployment, increase production, support the people's morale, transform society, and promote various constructions, in order to create the foundation of modern national obligatory labor. In order to realize the labor service movement, our association plans to uniformly reorganize all kinds of New Life Movement work activity groups into labor service corps. The military police, service personnel of party, government, and military agencies, school teachers and students, social groups, and leaders of various industries, based on the spirit of labor service, promote the three plans of militarization, productionization, and artification of life. Responsible personnel should be responsible for the organization, ensuring that the personnel under their command serve the society for one hour of labor service every day. The persons in charge of the New Life Movement in various places should especially follow the purpose of setting an example in person, engage in leadership, create a trend, make everyone regard labor service as valuable, and make them know that labor is the duty of life and service is the natural vocation of life. Then, together and unanimously, we will cooperate and unite into the entire strength of the nation to jointly devote ourselves to the great cause of national rejuvenation. The new life of our Republic of China lies in this. We specially formulate the outline as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to increase the efficiency of the New Life Movement, our association takes labor service as the center and promotes the "Preliminary Implementation Plan for the Militarization, Productionization, and Artification of Life," and organizes various labor service corps separately.</p>
<p>(2) The military police, faculty and students, party, government, and military agencies, various service personnel, women, and various social groups in various places may, in accordance with this outline and considering the local conditions, separately formulate simple organizational rules and establish labor service corps.</p>
<p>(3) Various labor service corps are organized by local or institutional groups. Their names may be determined according to the nature of the respective constituent elements and the names of the institutions. For example, "Nanchang City Women's New Life Labor Service Corps" "Pinghan Railway Employees' New Life Labor Service Corps," etc.</p>
<p>(4) Various labor service corps are directly subordinate to and guided by the local New Life Movement Promotion Association.</p>
<p>(5) Various labor service corps shall set up one director and one deputy director, who shall be filled by the responsible personnel of the constituent agencies or groups, or appointed by the local New Life Movement Association, or elected by the members. The group may be divided into teams and groups below the team, each team and group shall be set up a captain and a leader, which shall be appointed by the team leader. The detailed organization shall be the responsibility of the New Life Movement members in various places to formulate and implement themselves.</p>
<p>(6) The work of the labor service corps should be promoted separately in accordance with the "Preliminary Implementation Plan for the Militarization, Productionization, and Artification of Life" formulated by the General Association. In order to facilitate implementation, special regulations are made on the promotion plan as follows: 1. Punctuality Movement, 2. Public Literacy Movement, 3. Work-Study Movement (such as selling newspapers, selling books, writing letters, etc.) 4. Physical Exercise, 5. Group Education, 6. Social Hygiene Movement, 7. Promoting Cooperative Movement, 8. Promoting Baojia Movement, 9. Utilizing Waste Material Campaign, 10. Assisting in Household Investigation Campaign, 11. Assisting Police Investigation Campaign, 12. Canal Digging and Embankment Construction Movement, 13. Bridge Repair and Road Repair Movement, 14. Afforestation and Forest Collection Movement, 15. Promoting Savings and Insurance Movement, 16. Promoting the Use of Domestic Goods Movement, 17. Aiding the Old, Weak, Disabled, and Injured Movement, 18. Maintaining Decency and Aiding Those in Danger Movement, 19. Smoking and Gambling Cessation Movement, 20. Aviation and Air Defense Movement, 21. Promoting Scientific Movement.</p>
<p>(7) Each labor service corps may also select the work that is similar to its own nature from the various movements listed in the previous article and implement it in a practical way. They may also set a certain movement according to the season as the central work of each season (such as planting trees in spring, hygiene in summer, cooperation in autumn, road construction and relief in winter, etc.). The specific implementation plan and steps shall be drafted by the New Life Movement in various places and submitted for approval.</p>
<p>(8) Each member of the labor service corps must use their spare time after official duties, classes, and work to carry out labor service for at least one hour every day.</p>
<p>(9) Members of the labor service corps should receive training and obey the discipline of the group. The training methods and the discipline to be observed shall be stipulated by the General Association.</p>
<p>(10) The work situation of each labor service corps should be reported to the New Life Movement Promotion Association where it is located on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>(11) After the establishment of various labor service corps in various places, report to the local New Life Movement Promotion Association and forward it to our association for record. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Wuxi: Deed Tax Reduction Deadline at the End of the Month <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The county government announced that the deed tax rate for fields and houses in this province was originally 9.6%, but was reduced to 6.3% from May of the 23rd year. Initially, the limit was three months, but it was extended twice for three months each time. It will expire at the end of January this year. After deliberation by the 717th meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it was decided to extend the deadline for another three months due to the impact of last year's drought, which will end at the end of April. Those who continue to wait and see and conceal information will be mistaken. Once the extension expires, the collection will be strictly enforced. At that time, not only will the tax rate increase, but the penalties will also be heavier. A notice was issued yesterday, requiring all recent deeds and old deeds that have not been taxed to be taxed in full before the deadline at the end of April. District chiefs, township chiefs, and town chiefs should publicize this widely at any time and earnestly supervise and urge the payment.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Relief Committee Distributes Spring Relief <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Relief Committee is handling spring relief in this county. It was previously decided that, due to the extremely wide disaster area and the odd shortage of donations, the relief will only be distributed in the old Huaishang and Tianxia markets in the fifth and seventh districts, which are the most severely affected disaster areas. It was entrusted to district chiefs Zhao Hongbin and Du Xizhen for thorough investigation. As a result, there are more than 5,500 households in various townships in Huaishang and more than 2,500 households in Tianxia, totaling more than 8,000 households. It has now been decided to distribute 2.5 pecks of white rice per household, totaling more than 2,000 stones of rice. The foreign rice has also been purchased and the passport has been obtained in Shanghai. Zhao Du, the two district chiefs and township chief Jiang Ousun, etc., were notified by telegram yesterday to conduct a consultation, and the rice will be transported to the rural areas and distributed to households immediately.</p>

<p>Yan Chengqi, the patrol captain of the Public Security Bureau in Hetangqiao, District 5, went to the countryside to arrest soil dealer Ge Lao Si and others a few days ago. The villagers gathered to resist the arrest and robbed the soil dealer. Yan Chengqi returned to the bureau to report to Director Hao and requested a review from Magistrate Yan. In order to rectify the cunning behavior in the countryside, Yan ordered Deputy Zhang Pinquan of the 11th Security Brigade on the 10th to send team leader Wang of the first squadron to lead 40 team members to Hetangqiao to search for and arrest the main culprits and bring them to the city for legal processing.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate traffic in Jiaoxi Town in Wuyi County and prosper the markets along the road, the Wuyi County Government is building the Wujiao Road. Wang Baosu and others organized a long-distance bus company, submitted an application for a contract, and obtained approval from the Construction Department for the record. The people in Qishuyan, Hengshanqiao, Shiyan, and other places along the route were notified and asked the county government to start construction as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. The county government specially sent technician Shen Zhiyu at 7:00 or 8:00 am today (12th) to lead the surveyors to survey the route and implement the measurement, and set up wooden piles at any time. The road is 25 kilometers long and the measurement project is expected to be completed in one week. If the road construction project progresses smoothly, it can start within days.</p>

<p>The Provincial Anti-Smoking Association previously stipulated that counties that do not concurrently handle judicial affairs should set up special commissioners for handling opium cases, with the responsibility assigned to them. The method is for each county to select several people and submit them to the Provincial Association for qualification review and appointment. It is now learned that the review committee has been assumed by the three standing members of the Provincial Association, Yu Ye Xiang, and the President of the High Court, Zhu Shusheng. More than a dozen counties have already started reporting. In addition, the plan for the Crafts Institute for Opium Addicts, which the association is planning to set up in Nantong, has been drafted. The location is in Xiaohai Town, Nantong, with a budget of 15,000 yuan, which will be shared equally by the province and county.</p>

<p>Songfu Hospital at No. 59, Zhenming Road, Yongbu was founded by Rong Songfu from Cixi and has been in operation for more than ten years. The hospital building is a rented civilian house, with two courtyards in the front and back, a total of three buildings with upper story and three single-story buildings. Rong Songfu's wife, Ms. Feng, and her three daughters lived in the hospital. Recently, Songfu went to Shanghai for business, and his wife, Ms. Feng, went to the Daguangming Theater in Xinjie to watch a play with her daughters after dinner yesterday evening. Only the maid was left in the hospital to take care of it. Unexpectedly, around 11 o'clock, a fire suddenly broke out in the hospital. It took half an hour to put it out. All six hospital buildings were destroyed, and the loss was quite huge.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news item "Fire at Hangzhou Salt Affairs Audit Office" published on the local edition of your newspaper on April 9, which mentioned that the fire was caused by carelessness due to electrical leakage. After investigation by personnel dispatched by our factory, it was found that the electrical lighting equipment in the guard room that was burned in the fire was repaired last year, and there should be no electrical leakage. Before the true cause of the fire is found, it is difficult to make a guess. The report that the fire was caused by electrical leakage may be because the guards intended to shirk responsibility, so they made this excuse. After the dispatched personnel inspected the fire scene, there were only burnt pillars and tiles left, and the electrical wires had also been burned into black copper, making it impossible to prove that it was caused by electrical leakage. The details are written to you in a letter for correction. Please publish the truth to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hangzhou Electric Power Co., Ltd.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Qing Party Memorial Day: City Party Headquarters Held a General Meeting Yesterday, Attended by More Than 100 Representatives from All Walks of Life <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The City Party Headquarters held a Qing Party Memorial Day meeting in the auditorium of the City Party Headquarters at 9 am yesterday, gathering representatives from all walks of life. Secretary-General Jiang Huaisu presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the memorial. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: More than 100 people, including Kong Qingnan from the City Public Security Bureau, Ren Bin from the Toothbone Tool Industry Association, Qiu Wenming from the Land Bureau, Chen Jialiang from the Special First District Citizens' Federation, Zhu Yiyi from the Baoshan Fellow Association, Xi Meisheng from the First District Lumber Industry Association, Lin Kecong from the City Women's Association, Bao Jiasheng from the First District Paper Industry Association, representatives from various district party headquarters and branches, various schools, and various section and division staff members of the City Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the rituals, Chairman Jiang Huaisu first reported, saying that the General of our Party led the revolution and had a policy of accommodating the communists in the 13th year of the Republic of China. At that time, many revolutionaries were anesthetized by the Communist Party and joined the Communist Party. Among them, there were many who had ability. The General admitted communist members to participate in the National Revolution in order to make these able young people re-enter the right path. With the General's great personality, they were taught the Three People's Principles of the great revolution, knowing that they would definitely realize it and work hard for the Kuomintang. Later, many able people obeyed the General and struggled for the Three People's Principles. However, the Communist Party's conspiracy was rampant, and after the General's death, they occupied various places and wanted to usurp power. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, our Party had to implement the Qing Party for the sake of the party itself and for the future of the country. Since the Qing Party, the Communist Party has initially used its ability to divide and alienate, and then used the guerrilla-style to disturb the rural areas of the interior, and used its extremely despicable methods to deceive the ignorant peasants and workers to drive them. In recent years, all kinds of unprecedented cruel behaviors have caused China to suffer unprecedented catastrophes. Now that the Red Bandits have reached the end of their rope, we should unify our thoughts, unify our will, and show great strength. The National Revolution will definitely succeed one day.</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans: After the report, the slogans were shouted: (1) Eradicate the Red Bandits who deceive peasants and workers! (2) Eliminate the Red Bandits who destroy social order! (3) Suppress the remaining bandits in Sichuan and Guizhou! (4) Obey the party's discipline! (5) Strictly organize the party! (6) Vigorously carry out production and construction! (7) Practice the New Life Movement! (8) Long live the Three People's Principles! (9) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! (10) Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Military Police on Alert: The military and police agencies declared an alert on this day. The City Public Security Bureau added sentry police to all main thoroughfares and important roads. The Police Garrison Command also sent patrol teams to patrol the city, so the whole day was peaceful as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Li Liejun Returned to Shanghai Yesterday: Li Talked About Feng Yuxiang's Mountain Residence as Before, and the Military Discipline in Shandong Province is Strict and Construction is Progressing <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Member of the Central Committee Li Liejun went to Shandong last month to climb Mount Tai and meet with Feng Yuxiang. Then he went to Qingdao for a short stay. He took the China Merchants Bureau Haiyuan Wheel and left Qingdao to return to Shanghai a few days ago. He arrived here at 7 am yesterday morning and went straight to his private residence on Masingnan Road to rest. Li later received newspaper reporters in the morning and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Feng's Mountain Residence: According to Li, Mr. Feng reads and writes in the mountains as before. He eats simple meals and seems to be planning to spend his life there. When leaving Qingdao, there was a phone call from Jinan saying that Mr. Huanzhang intended to visit Laoshan. Seeing that he visited Jiaodong last year, it is likely that he will visit soon.</p>
<p>Situation in Shandong Province: Wherever I passed, the military and civilians of Shandong Province welcomed me on the way. The military discipline has always been strict. Recently, the generals have been engaged in reading and practicing calligraphy, seemingly cherishing the time to learn and act in a timely manner. In the past, the Shandong Provincial Government and the county governments had a slight suspicion of being chaotic and using heavy punishment and interfering in judicial affairs. Recently, they have been able to respect judicial independence. However, for some reason, cases of smoking, gambling, and gambling have been separated from the judicial organs, so the severity of the crime is slightly different from that recorded in the law, and the people are suffering from it. If this level is improved, and the people are given time to renew themselves, it will be completely in line with the rule of law. Shandong Province is inherently rich, and it is easy to use and guide it in construction. The provincial government is engaged in this, and there will be something to watch in the future. It is a pity that the local people have suffered the pain of oppression by the Beiyang warlords for many years, and only seek to fulfill their obligations as much as possible, and do not seek to enjoy their rights very much, which is a shortcoming. This is not only the case in Shandong Province, but it is also commonly seen in other provinces. If the provincial government and intellectuals can do their best to promote it, it may not be impossible.</p>
<p>Qingdao Construction: Qingdao has a small area and has been well-scaled since ancient times. Now that Shen Honglie is in charge, it is like Shiyuan governing Laiyang. Every village has schools, highway cooperatives, etc. Almost everything that the people need is available. In other words, food, clothing, housing and transportation are all solved. Therefore, the local government has a reputation for political clarity. The Children's Day Commemoration Conference is currently being held, and the whole city is dancing with joy, which can be seen as a glimpse. Han Fuqu and Shen Honglie both have their strengths. If they can both inherit their strengths, then Shandong Province should be above other provinces. There are many foreigners in Qingdao, but there are few reports of disturbances. Is it because the foreigners love themselves? It is the season when hundreds of flowers are blooming, and tourists are flocking. Due to the good climate, the Jiaoji Railway and the good management of the police, many houses have been rented out, and this summer's heat escape will be even more spectacular.</p>

<p>Member of the Central Committee Li Shizeng, accompanied by Zhang Jingjiang and Wu Zhihui, the two members of the Central Committee, was summoned to Sichuan by telegram from Chairman Jiang. Now that the official business is over, Li first flew from Chongqing to Wuhan, and then took the Taikoo Company Wusong to return east. He arrived in Beijing on the 11th and met with Wang Sun and other authorities. He took the night train to Shanghai that evening and arrived at the North Station at 7 am yesterday morning. He went straight back to his residence to rest. Yesterday afternoon, Li went to the Central Bank to visit Minister of Finance Kong. It is heard that Li intends to take the transportation south to Hong Kong and Guangdong within the week to meet with the members of the Central Committee in the southwest and visit Hu Hanmin's illness. Zhang Jingjiang took the Minxian Transportation directly from Chongqing to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port around the 15th. Wu Zhihui is still staying in Sichuan for sightseeing.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Credit Loans Should Be Discussed with the Three Banks: Ministry of Finance's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce, etc. <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, local associations, previously drafted a four-point outline for handling small industrial and commercial credit loans to revive the market. They submitted it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting an allocation of 2.5 million yuan to form a syndicate with the financial community to handle the loans. The Ministry of Finance replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating: We have received your submission. The situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai does indeed necessitate relief. We previously received your association's petition for relief, which has already been approved. Now, regarding the outline for handling small industrial and commercial credit loans you submitted, specifically the third item stipulating that the government would allocate 2.5 million yuan, and the Shanghai Banking Association's statement that they had discussed and agreed to raise funds for small loans, the Ministry, considering the overall situation, and to consolidate finance and facilitate the relief of industry and commerce, has already implemented measures to increase bank capital and strengthen their financial power. All loan matters have been delegated to the banks. The Ministry, as an administrative organ, cannot directly lend money. We have instructed the Shanghai Banking Association to directly discuss specific measures with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications (the "Three Banks"), and to implement loan disbursement according to banking regulations to provide relief. We have also sent separate letters of instruction. This is hereby notified. The Banking Association also received an instruction from the Ministry of Finance, Document No. 12703, stating: Regarding the Shanghai Local Association's resolution on the second article of the outline for handling small industrial and commercial credit loans, which stipulates that the government and the banking industry share the recognition of the total loan amount, please advise whether the Ministry should guide and form a syndicate with the banking industry, or devise other methods. We have received your submission, along with the submission from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association regarding the same matter. The situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai does indeed necessitate relief. The Ministry, considering the overall situation, and to consolidate finance and facilitate the relief of industry and commerce, has already implemented measures to increase bank capital and strengthen their financial power. All loan matters have been delegated to the banks. The Ministry, as an administrative organ, cannot directly lend money. We have sent separate letters to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, instructing them to directly discuss specific measures with the association, and to implement loan disbursement according to banking regulations to provide relief. In addition to the instructions issued, you are hereby ordered to comply and report accordingly.</p>
<p>The Three Banks Obey Orders to Handle Loans: The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have received orders from the Ministry of Finance to implement loan disbursement according to banking regulations to provide relief to industry and commerce. It is reported that all three banks have decided to adopt the same method as last year's year-end account settlement, specifically setting aside a large sum of money for interbank lending, to facilitate adjustment and indirectly relieve industry and commerce. Banks and money shops that apply can handle it according to the method used during last year's year-end account settlement. At the same time, they will consult with the Banking Association to discuss specific measures.</p>
<p>The Subcommittee Will Meet: The subcommittee organized by the Banking Association for small industrial and commercial credit loans, after raising 2.5 million yuan from member banks, originally planned to form a syndicate with the Central Bank after the Ministry of Finance allocated 2.5 million yuan. After the Ministry stated that it could not directly provide loans, it was decided to convene a meeting after Committee member Chen Guangfu returned to Shanghai from Beijing to discuss whether to form a syndicate solely by the banking industry, or to contact the Three Banks to discuss specific measures before making a decision. This will be put forward for discussion.</p>

<p>After the Banking Association passed six principles regarding acceptance drafts, in addition to submitting requests to the Ministry of Finance based on the second principle, requesting that these discounted notes be allowed to be used to offset the issuance guarantee reserve, and requesting the Central Bank to announce the discount rate daily and post it publicly based on the third principle, they also replied to the Chamber of Commerce, stating: Regarding your letter No. 1893 of March 22, stating that the Silk Industry Association discussed the handling of commercial acceptance drafts, and the Central Bank has agreed to handle rediscounting, but it is necessary to first agree on the discount method, and your council resolved to send letters to the Banking and Money Shop Associations to formulate methods, and recommend representatives to jointly discuss progress, we have reviewed your association's principles for handling acceptance draft discounting, and the subcommittee has drafted six principles, which are enclosed for your review. As for the representatives, we have nominated Jing Runshi of the Bank of China and Xue Yisheng of the Bank of Communications to attend and participate. We respectfully reply and hope for your consideration.</p>

<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, speaking to reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday afternoon, dismissed rumors of an impending currency conference in Beijing, saying, "That's just childish talk, not worth a laugh."

Finally, Mr. Kong told reporters that the Yellow River breach at Guantai had been blocked.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Banking Sector Deeply Hope the Authorities Calmly Cope with the US Raising Silver Prices, Take Advantage of Domestic Economic Strength to Be Self-Sufficient, Promptly and Properly Plan the Entire Strategy to Stabilize Finance <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that after US President Roosevelt implemented raising silver prices this Wednesday (the 10th), the impact caused world silver prices to rise unanimously. Although the local financial market has not yet felt any major impact, the banking sector is deeply concerned about the US government's continuous use of artificial methods to raise silver prices. According to general observation, although the government has taken various measures such as increasing silver export taxes and encouraging the import of foreign silver to stabilize domestic finance, if foreign countries continue to raise silver prices artificially, the continued outflow of domestic silver will be inevitable. Therefore, they deeply hope that the government can calmly cope with this period, take advantage of the domestic economic strength to be self-sufficient, and promptly and properly plan the entire strategy to stabilize finance, so that the foundation of the national economy may not be shaken by foreign threats.</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai preview exhibition of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art has been running for five days, from its opening until yesterday. Chinese and foreign individuals, because of the rare opportunity to publicly exhibit these rare collections, have been visiting in the thousands every day. Many arrive in the morning and visit on an empty stomach, and some do not leave until evening. There are also those who visit every day, which shows the greatness of art and the depth of Chinese and foreign people's love for art. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed the person in charge of the exhibition yesterday and learned the following:</p>
<p>Throne Furniture: The Qianlong imperial furniture, stationery, etc. selected by the Palace Museum for the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art have all arrived, including: (1) One rosewood desk, with inscriptions by Liu Yong, Weng Fanggang, etc. carved around the desk; (2) One cloisonné-inlaid throne with clouds and bats, with gilded lacquer footstool; (3) One cloisonné-inlaid screen with scenes of immortal mountains and pavilions, with base; (4) Two bone-tube small writing brushes; (5) One white jade carved pine penholder; (6) One Qianlong-style fish-shaped imperial ink cake; (7) One white jade ink bed, with wooden base; (8) One white jade octagonal ink paste box; (9) Three white jade seals, with wooden box, one engraved with the four characters "Qianlong Chen Han", one engraved with the four characters "Xun Yan Hua An", and one engraved with the five characters "Tu Shu Bi You Yuan"; (10) One Song Chengni stone canal inkstone, with inlaid jade wooden box; (11) One white jade five-sons pen rest, with wooden base; (12) One white jade melon-shaped water holder, with jade spoon; (13) One carved lacquer round box; (14) One Song Ge ware awl-handled bottle, with wooden base; (15) One white jade tube brush, with jade brush cap; (16) One boxwood carved plum blossom armrest, with Xuanzai inscription. The above sixteen items, totaling nineteen pieces, are being sorted and will be displayed publicly in the coming days.</p>
<p>British Community Reception: A group organized by the British community in this port, called the Rotary Club, recently hosted Mr. Hobson, one of the five British commissioners specially sent to China to select antiques. Mr. Hobson gave a long speech on ancient Chinese art, lamenting that it was an exhibition opportunity unseen in thirty years, and also said, "Westerners have a great love for Chinese art, but they are often deceived by clever antique dealers and fail to fully understand Chinese art. Now they can finally see the true face of Mount Lu." A large number of people attended that day, all upper-class British people in Shanghai, and the listeners were all deeply interested.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Groups: The association is offering preferential treatment to academic groups to allow them to glimpse our ancient Chinese art. They are currently formulating preferential treatment methods for academic groups, generally requiring a minimum of ten people and a maximum of twenty-five people per unit. A formal letter of request must be sent to the association, which will arrange the time and schedule for visits. Badges of the group must be worn upon entry. However, Saturdays and Sundays will likely be exceptions.</p>
<p>Famous Artists' Praise: In addition to those in this city, many Westerners have come from afar to visit the exhibition in recent days.

<p>The Shiye News Agency reports that the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, in order to unite forces and regulate finance, has initiated the organization of the Commercial Union Bank, with a fixed capital of 5 million yuan, and has appointed Standing Committee member Zhou Shouyu to raise shares in various places. Mr. Zhou arrived in Shanghai on the Haili steamboat the day before yesterday morning and contacted the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday. He is scheduled to go to Beijing tonight. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Comes to Shanghai to Raise Shares</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Shouyu, Standing Committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, at 3 pm yesterday to discuss the progress of raising shares for the Commercial Union Bank. Mr. Lin expressed approval in principle for the establishment of the Commercial Union Bank. However, he felt that setting the share price at five yuan was too fragmented and seemed inconsistent with banking regulations. Therefore, he suggested setting it at fifty yuan and that shareholders need not be limited to businesses. After Mr. Zhou left, he told a Shiye News Agency reporter, "In addition to raising shares for the Commercial Union Bank, I (Zhou referring to himself) also plan to contact journalists from various places to organize a National Journalists Association. I am scheduled to take the train to Beijing tomorrow night (tonight), stay in Beijing for one to four days, and then return to Shanghai. I am scheduled to take the President Coolidge liner to the United States on the 23rd of this month to inspect overseas Chinese businesses and encourage them to invest in the motherland and develop industries."</p>
<p>Guangdong Chamber of Commerce Requests Assistance</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday received a letter from Liu Buchi, Executive Committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, stating: "Dear Sir, it has been noted that our country's economy is declining daily, suffering from the invasion of foreign capital externally and the collapse of the countryside internally. Financial resources are depleted, which is not a matter of a day or two. Recently, due to the global recession and the impact of silver policies, it has suffered an even greater blow. At this critical juncture of survival, there is no way to save the situation without unity and concentration of strength. I have humbly drafted a plan for the Commercial Union Bank, which I have submitted to the Guangdong authorities and the gentlemen of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, who have adopted it and established a preparatory office to proceed. Its purpose is to unite shops throughout the province, gather strength from many sources, accumulate small amounts into large, in order to establish a powerful financial institution that specializes in the relief of rural areas. Each shop must subscribe to at least one share as a necessary condition, and more subscriptions are welcome. Each share is set at five yuan in national currency. This method is extremely ordinary and the organization is very simple, but its effectiveness can be well-suited to the requirements of the current situation. I respectfully present this to your association in detail. Our country has a vast territory and inconvenient transportation. In addition to large cities, many places have difficulty with remittance and financial activity cannot develop, and a hundred industries have no way to develop. If the Commercial Union Bank is established, then wherever there is a shop, there is the power of the bank. Various methods can be used to connect finance, even in remote areas. Just like the blood vessels of the human body, blood circulation makes the body naturally strong. This is one of its effects. Chinese businessmen have rarely been connected. The establishment of the Commercial Union Bank will unify the will of businessmen and be of great benefit to the future of commercial operations. Furthermore, it can achieve the effect of mutual cooperation and coordination. This is the second effect. The disorder of our country's currency system is known to all. Merchants find it troublesome to transfer funds and suffer intangible losses from repeated calculations. If the Commercial Union Bank is established, it can become a center of finance and a hub of the economy, and gradually improve. This is the third effect. It is undeniable that our country's economy has long been manipulated by the forces of foreign goods. Domestic banks mostly focus on cities, so the decline of the countryside is bound to worsen day by day. If the Commercial Union Bank is established, it will focus on the relief of the countryside, such as running agricultural warehouses and small loans for agricultural workers. The capital of the cities will inevitably return to the countryside, which can not only assist agricultural workers and increase production, but also gradually remove the shackles of foreign capital. This is the fourth effect. The above points are the effects after the establishment of the Commercial Union Bank. Today, the whole country is shaken by the bad environment of recession. All enlightened people regard cooperative business as the only strategy to save the current crisis. The organization of the Commercial Union Bank is a simple and easy way to cooperate in finance. Your association is the leader of chambers of commerce nationwide, and Shanghai is the economic center of the country. If you consider this matter feasible, please grasp the key points and call for a united, large-scale cooperation among the chambers of commerce of all provinces. On the one hand, request the government to grant substantial assistance in order to achieve rapid success. An ancient saying says, 'It is simple at the beginning, but great at the end.' I hope you will carefully consider and pay attention to it (rest omitted)."</p>
<p>National Chamber of Commerce Replies in Agreement</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Kanghou specially replied yesterday, saying: "Dear Sir, I have just received your letter requesting the joint organization of the National Commercial Union Bank. Your great plans are admirable. However, this matter is of great importance and must have a strict organizational law before it can proceed. Otherwise, it will be just empty words and will inevitably lead to failure. If you have any plans, please send them in advance for discussion. As for the subscription of shares, it seems to me that it cannot be based on shops, and five yuan per share is also too fragmented. The minimum should be fifty yuan. I don't know if you agree with my humble opinion. I hereby reply, hoping for your consideration."</p>

<p>The Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" of the 12th reported that the establishment of a consumer goods department in embassies and consulates has caused a major opposition movement among Japanese merchants in Shanghai. At 7 pm today, the Japanese Business and Industry Association held a meeting at the association's office on Wusong Road to determine specific countermeasures against the establishment of consumer goods departments in embassies and consulates. Among them, Japanese food and grocery merchants are particularly fierce. They are currently soliciting opinions from all shops in Hongkou, and first submit a specific proposal to the Business and Industry Association, requesting the Consulate-General to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or send two or three representatives to Tokyo to submit a petition. The development of this issue is not just a matter between a few shops and the embassies and consulates, but may develop into an entire issue for all shops in Hongkou. Therefore, on the one hand, Japanese merchants are working hard to eliminate this proposal, but on the other hand, the initiators of the establishment of the embassies and consulates are ignoring it for the sake of maintaining their own lives.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Northeast Disabled Soldiers Wang Yamin and Others Petitioned the Party Headquarters Yesterday for Relief; Party Headquarters Sent a Letter to the Public Security Bureau Requesting Repatriation <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Da Gong News Agency reports that Wang Yamin, Lin Jingbin, Li Yimin, and 21 other disabled soldiers of Ma Zhanshan's troops were injured and disabled in the Anti-Japanese War. After the war ended, they worked at the Heilongjiang Boji Factory to make a living. Unexpectedly, in March of this year, they were forcibly expelled by Zhang Zhizhu, commander of the puppet army in the area, and escorted to Yingkou, transferred to Tianjin, and disbanded. After arriving in Tianjin, the soldiers searched for their superiors without success. Hearing that Commander-in-Chief Ma Zhanshan had come to Shanghai, they transferred to Shanghai on the 30th of last month to visit and request relief.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Party Headquarters for Relief: After arriving in Shanghai for more than ten days, they found no news and became destitute in Shanghai, unable to maintain their livelihood. At 10 a.m. yesterday, they jointly submitted a document to the Fenglinqiao Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting repatriation. They were received by Yu Yaoqiu, an officer of the Investigation Section, who praised the soldiers' efforts for the country. After consulting the Secretary-General, he agreed to provide assistance with travel expenses and send a letter to the relief agencies for repatriation. The soldiers expressed their gratitude and then withdrew.</p>
<p>Sending a Letter to the Public Security Bureau for Repatriation: After receiving the petition from the disabled soldiers, the Municipal Party Headquarters sent a special letter to the Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting the issuance of boat tickets for repatriation. The original letter stated, "Dear Sir, we have received a petition from wounded soldiers Wang Yamin and others, stating that they came to Shanghai to visit Commander Ma Zhanshan but did not meet him, and lack funds to return home. Based on this, we have investigated and confirmed that these wounded soldiers are indeed northerners who previously worked hard for the country. This time, because they did not meet the commander, they are destitute in Shanghai, which is very pitiful. We propose that your bureau issue boat tickets at your discretion to assist them in returning home. We hereby send a special letter, hoping you will consider and handle it. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau." At the same time, they also sent a letter to the Charity Federation, requesting them to provide a subsidy to facilitate their departure.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Dredging the Wusong River: Yujiadun Dam Was Removed Yesterday, Ships Resumed Normal Traffic <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>After the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission dredged the Wusong River and dammed it at Yujiadun, Beishi rice boats had to detour through Nanhuhuangpu for transshipment. Yesterday, the dam was removed, and rice boats can still be transported to Shanghai via the original route. The price of rice in Beishi has shrunk by three corners in the past two days. As for the manure boats, they have also returned to normal. According to a rice boat merchant interviewed by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, when the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Association closed the dam on April 1st, there was still a route available, but the dredging workers had to charge each boat a transit fee of two yuan, so the boats all detoured. Now that the Water Conservancy Association has announced the resumption of traffic, the traffic of ships has returned to normal.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Chongqing Municipality Various Industries Business Declaration <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Business Association has sent a declaration from various merchants in Chongqing requesting the Sichuan Provincial Government to revise tax regulations. The declaration is recorded as follows: We in Sichuan have long suffered from exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. Officials extract marrow from bones, their desires are insatiable. The people endure the burden with pain, their sweat and blood exhausted. In the past, Sichuan was known as the "Land of Abundance," but now it has become a "Den of Demons." All industries are in decline, the people are struggling to survive, scars are everywhere, and suffering abounds. Fortunately, the Central Government is concerned about the people of Sichuan and has turned its attention westward. The Provincial Government has been reorganized, and administrative reforms are being carried out. At the beginning of its establishment, Chairman Fu Gong immediately announced the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies to our people, and established local tax bureaus to handle local tax affairs, planning comprehensive and perfect methods to thoroughly eliminate malpractices that harm businesses and the people. We were celebrating the renewal of the tax system, with the hope of seeing the dawn, without the worry of future oppression, and with the expectation of recovery. Unexpectedly, the "One Tax Collection System" issued by the Sichuan Provincial Local Tax Bureau, the content of its tax regulations, was initially kept secret and not clearly announced. Later, due to requests from various guilds, explanations were given to the chambers of commerce, stating that "the assessment standard is not based on customs, but must be based on market prices. Ordinary goods are subject to a 10% export tax and a 15% import tax. Special goods are subject to temporary determination, levied at customs value plus 30% or 20%, or special taxes, etc., in addition to the regular tax, an additional 10% anti-communist suppression fee is added, effective from March 21st." Examining the reduction of the people's burden, it is not about empty words of empathy for business difficulties, but about practice. If the soup is changed but not the medicine, how can the chronic illness gradually improve? Setting up clever names to engage in harsh levies, the pain of the people will inevitably be greater. The "One Tax Collection System" issued by the Local Tax Bureau is, in name, a unified tax system, but in reality, it is the embodiment of exorbitant taxes and levies, becoming more severe and several times greater than in the past. To put it bluntly, it is a tax on top of various exorbitant taxes and levies, plus a suppression fee. (Omitted excerpt)... For the sake of our own survival, for the sake of Chongqing's prosperity, and for the sake of the safety and security of Sichuan's future, we put forward reasonable demands based on conscience and present them to various authorities, requesting relief. For more than ten days, after several appeals, the Provincial Government has slightly changed the regulations for export goods, but the difficulties faced by the wholesale guilds remain the same, without any reduction. Until the end of last month, as a result of face-to-face negotiations between representatives of various guilds and Director Liu of the Finance Department, the following measures were obtained: (1) Each trade association will elect an evaluation committee, together with the local tax bureau, to assess the value of goods, and thereafter taxes will be levied based on the assessed value. (2) For goods already collected but not yet picked up by various guilds, from April 1st, various businesses are allowed to go to the tax bureau with a certificate of responsibility from the trade association to register and pick up the goods. After the price of the goods is assessed, taxes will be paid accordingly. Although the above measures do not provide any real benefits, representatives of various guilds, understanding the government's difficulties, spared no effort to persuade members of their respective associations to endure the pain temporarily. However, members of various guilds believe that this kind of measure has many practical difficulties and even greater invisible harms, and they generally oppose it and do not agree with it. There are thousands of varieties of goods in each guild, with varying prices, making the evaluation extremely difficult. If each item must be listed, the variety is too large. If a second evaluation is required, the procedures are too cumbersome. Moreover, even if members of various guilds follow Director Liu of the Finance Department's measures, and prepare certificates from trade associations and go to pick up goods according to procedures, the tax bureau also refuses to implement it with excuses, and still requires them to pay taxes according to regulations before allowing them to pick up goods. Their lack of sincerity is already imaginable. In our disappointment, we are bewildered, and therefore make the resolution to die, and make the following decisions: 1. The standard for levying taxes on imported goods transported by rotation shall be based on the customs tariff, and no increase shall be allowed. 2. For imported postal packages, the local post office shall collect taxes on behalf of the customs tariff. 3. The tax rate on imported goods shall not exceed 7.5% at most. 4. No additional taxes shall be levied in addition to the regular tax. The above four items are the painful cries we have issued out of necessity. It has been decided by the public that we will resolutely implement them from today onwards, and will not stop until the goal is achieved. This declaration is made by the Chongqing Municipality Cloth and Silk Trade Association, the Suzhou Goods Trade Association, the Dried Vegetables Trade Association, the Hardware and Sundries Trade Association, the Western Medicine Trade Association, the Paper and Printing Trade Association, the Books and Stationery Trade Association, and the Clothing Trade Association, issued on April 10th, Republic of China Year 24.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Cleaners in Hongkou District Initiated Another Strike Yesterday Morning, Resuming Work at Noon After Mediation by the Party Department <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Cleaners in Zhabei District went on strike the day before yesterday because the contractor Chen Shaofu had not paid their wages for a long time. At the same time, night soil collectors along Qiujiang Road also went on strike due to the same situation. After persuasion by the Party Department, they resumed work at noon. Unexpectedly, at around 5 a.m. yesterday, 116 night soil collectors in the Xingjia Muqiao area of Hongkou District went on strike again from 6 a.m. because the contractor Ma Leming's whereabouts were still unknown, and the middle-level staff hid and refused to meet them, without any guarantee for their unpaid wages. After hearing the news, the District Cleaners' Union sent personnel to dissuade them, but to no avail. They then sent Xu Xuecheng, Wu Zhilai, Guan Yian, and others to the Municipal Party Department to report and ask for instructions. The Municipal Party Department then sent Lu Yinchu to persuade them, and at the same time went to the Finance Bureau to discuss solutions with Section Chief Wang of the Bureau's Second Section, and staff member Ni. As a result, it was decided that the Finance Bureau would be responsible for recovering the arrears from the contractor's guarantor and paying them all within three days. All the workers were satisfied and resumed work at around 11 a.m.</p>

<p>The China Jisheng Association has been handling river work in Zhang Guo Village, Southern Nanjing, since last year, which has been ongoing for several months. More than one hundred people work every day. Now that spring is ending, there is a lot of rain, which hinders work. After repeated urging, the Association continues to proceed quickly to benefit agricultural production. It has remitted a certain amount of foreign currency from the Guohua Bank as the fourth batch of wages to assist. However, the wages are small and insufficient to solve the problem. It is hoped that fellow philanthropists at home and abroad will take advantage of this time of scarcity and severe disaster to provide relief and help to achieve complete success. In addition, the western area of Yangzhou is an extremely poverty-stricken disaster area, and the victims are starving and unable to survive. Mr. Liu Lingsheng previously pleaded with the Association to allocate disaster relief funds and work with local gentry to provide relief together. The Association has now publicly elected member Mr. Cheng Ruizhi to inspect and distribute aid. He departed by car on the 12th of this month. The Association previously ran a porridge factory in Yangzhou, and Mr. Cheng will also inspect and report on the connection.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association started the fundraising campaign, it has worked very hard. In order to widely solicit members and expand publicity, the Headquarters sent a letter to the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday, requesting that postal workers distribute various fundraising promotional materials each time they deliver letters, and solicit residents throughout the city to join the Aviation Association as members.

<h3 id="e121">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Presents to the Ministry, Striving for Hong Kong Passenger Permits <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The "Si Hai" ship, built with Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds, and the "Hai Yuan" ship employ foreigners as the chief and second mates, chief engineer, and chief and second assistant engineers. Therefore, Hong Kong granted passenger permits. However, the "Hai Heng," "Hai Li," and "Hai Zhen" ships were refused passenger permits because they employed Chinese crew members. Because of its status as a state-run company, the company was unwilling to compromise or hire all foreign crew members. Therefore, it abandoned Hong Kong passenger permits for the three ships and requested the Central Government to negotiate. However, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors asked the Ministry of Communications, as the three "Hai" ships did not carry Hong Kong passengers, causing significant business losses and not in line with the original agreement. The Ministry of Communications forwarded the inquiry to the company. As a result, it was found that abandoning Hong Kong passengers for the three ships caused an annual loss of more than 50,000 yuan. If foreign crew members were hired instead, the salary expenses would also increase by more than 20,000 yuan, resulting in an actual loss of only more than 20,000 yuan. However, this would cause significant damage to national prestige and sovereignty, which is difficult to compromise. Hong Kong and Kowloon are ceded territories, so it is not possible to ask the Hong Kong authorities to recognize our crew certificates. After discussion, the company has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that a special commissioner be dispatched to the UK to negotiate with the British government, striving for them to order the Hong Kong government to recognize the validity of our country's crew certificates and grant passenger permits to allow for the carrying of Hong Kong passengers. The submission was sent to Beijing yesterday.</p>

<p>At around 10 PM the night before last, a well-dressed young man and a woman in a gray silk cheongsam suddenly came to the Da Hu Hotel west of East Xinqiao on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. They opened room 220 on the second floor and paid a deposit of two yuan. On the registration book, they signed Chen Shanchang, 24 years old, from Guangdong, currently working at the Nanyang Tobacco Company, and Li Suqin, 17 years old, also from Guangdong. After entering the room, the two immediately closed the door and went to bed. Unexpectedly, at around 9 AM yesterday morning, the duty tea boy suddenly heard moaning sounds from the room, so he pushed open the door and entered. He saw the two hugging each other tightly, lying on their backs on the bed, their faces pale. He knew that they had taken poison and found a Snowflake Cream bottle on the table, containing a small amount of opium. He immediately reported it to the police station. The head of the police sent detectives to investigate, then sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. Two suicide notes were found beside the two. One was written by the man, addressed to Liu Tao at No. 147 Heping Lane, Baibolu Road, North Sichuan Road. The letter stated that he had committed suicide, please inform his mother, and don't be sad. He only asked that they be buried in the same grave after death. The letter was signed Zheng Jia at the end. The other letter was written by the woman, addressed to her widowed mother at No. 573 West Wuchang Road, Dean Grocery Store, stating that because of her unreasonable oppression and the destruction of the marriage, she had no choice but to die. However, after the doctors administered an enema, the two were out of danger. After further rest, they can recover their health.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Sunken Lin Xing Wheel Has Started Service Again, and the Body of the Captain Has Been Recovered <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The "Lin Xing" towed barge of the Songhu Maoxing Company was sunk by the "Xin Shuntai" small vessel outside Sanxia Shuikou at 10:30 PM on March 14th due to a dispute over business. The captain, Huang Helou, fell into the water with the ship and drowned. The Fourth Squad of the Water Patrol detained the two crew members of the "Xin Shuntai" who caused the accident and sent them to the Shanghai Local Court for questioning. The shipwreck's location was found by the Hydrographic Survey Bureau. The details have been reported repeatedly in this newspaper. It is learned that after Maoxing Company learned the location of the sunken ship, fearing it would obstruct the navigation route, it hired workers to salvage it at a cost of 350 yuan. After the ship was salvaged, Maoxing Company sent personnel to inspect and found that the hull of the "Lin Xing" was made of iron, so it was not severely damaged. The damaged parts were only the bridge and various equipment on the deck, which required repair costs of more than 2,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e134">Fire at Oil Shop on Wuzhen Road, Losses of 7-8,000 Yuan <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A fire broke out at the Ruitai Oil Shop at No. 15-17 Wuzhen Road Bridge in Zhabei at 10:45 AM yesterday. The shop happened to be located south of the Wuzhen Road Police Station of the Xinzha Branch Bureau, separated by only three storefronts, so Inspector Luo Siwei immediately called the Fire Brigade after hearing the alarm and sent a leather hose truck to the scene for rescue. On the one hand, he led the patrol police to maintain order. After the fire brigades made every effort to put out the fire, it was extinguished at 11:05 AM. It is estimated that two rooms of the shop's building were destroyed, and the roof was not penetrated. Afterwards, the police station arrested the arsonist, Gu Chengchu, 35 years old, from Jiading, who confessed that he was the accountant in the oil shop. The boss, Pan Ruifu, was not in the shop. The cause of the fire was that the old servant Cao Tonggen (from Tongzhou) was opening an oil barrel, and the screw had rusted. He hit it with an iron hammer, and sparks flew out and entered the oil, causing the disaster. Cao Tonggen has now fled, and the other apprentices are unknown. About 4-500 cans of kerosene, diesel, motor oil, machine oil, etc. were burned, with a total loss of 7-8,000 yuan including the shop's foundation, excluding the house. The shop did not have fire insurance. After verifying the confession, Inspector Luo sent him to the Xinzha Branch Bureau, and Bureau member Ouyang Liu, after clarifying the previous situation, ordered him to be sent to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>

<p>The kettle shop at No. 208 Longhua Road, Nanshi, was previously leased by Wang Zuoju from Anhui. Recently, the original owner took it back and leased it to Wang Wenyao (40 years old) from Nanjing to take over. Wang Zuoju suspected that Wang Wenyao was instigating and encroaching on his business, so they became feuding enemies. At 7 PM on March 21st, Wang Xiaoheshang, Wang Zhenbiao, Fei Dequan, Xu Dequan, Tang Xiaowuzi, etc. came to Wang Wenyao's house with knives, wooden sticks, and other weapons, dragged Wang Wenyao out, and slashed his head with a knife. At that time, blood flowed profusely, and he fell to the ground unconscious. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers immediately dispersed. Afterwards, Wang Wenyao's wife, Ms. Yang (30 years old), took the injured person by car to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. On the one hand, she reported the situation to the police station in charge and dispatched police to Julu Road, arrested Wang Zuoju, the uncle of Wang Xiaoheshang, and arrested Zhang (24 years old, from Tianjin), the wife of Wang Zhenbiao, and another accomplice, Fei Dequan (24 years old, from Anhui), at No. 198 Longhua Road. The three were arrested and sent to the Local Court. Wang Wenyao died due to his injuries the next day. Prosecutor Wu Deying went to the court to verify that he died from injuries. With confirmation by Prosecutor Wu, it went to criminal court. At 10 AM yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened the court for trial. First, the victim's wife, Wang Yang, testified as described above and requested redress. Next, Wang Zuoju, Fei Dequan, and Wang Zhang, etc., gave evasive statements. At this point, Prosecutor Wu Deying came to court to present his opinion, followed by the lawyer Hu Yuanjun, hired by the defendants, who defended them. The judge considered it concluded and scheduled the judgment for the 18th of this month. The three defendants were returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>Jin Jiulin, Inspector of the Special Agency of the French Concession Police Department, along with detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Bingcheng, etc., successively arrested renowned ringleader of kidnapping giant bandits and suspects Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, Liu Yimin, Wu Shaoting, Geng Huatang, Li Yueshan, Yu Yuanzhou, Chang Jianxi, Bian Zenghua, Wang Shikong, Fang Qingshan, and woman Zheng Chen (Zheng Tangsheng's concubine, formerly a prostitute) and other men and women, twelve in total, in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin and elsewhere on July 25, 1933. They were transferred to Shanghai, where it was discovered that they had successively kidnapped Huang Yuyi, Vice President of the Zhongnan Bank; Chen Yanghe, Assistant Manager of the Si Ming Bank; He Shaoting, owner of the Xin Sen Ji Construction Factory; Gu Zelin, son of Yunnan Division Commander, etc.; and wealthy timber merchant Huang Baohua, extorting huge sums as ransom in Tianjin and Shanghai. They were also involved in the murder of Xiaoshaoxing, a member of their gang, and the kidnapping of Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, Compradors of the Jardine Matheson Company in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Kidnapping and tearing up the tickets, burying corpses to destroy evidence and other major cases. They were handed over to the Second Special Court for public prosecution under the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. Because no criminal behavior was found on Zheng's concubine, Chen, she was not prosecuted and was first released. After investigation and trial, Zheng and the other eleven were sentenced on October 14 of the same year. Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, Liu Yimin, and Wu Shaoting were each sentenced to death and deprived of their public rights for life. Li Yueshan was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Yu Yuanzhou, Chang Jianxi, Bian Zenghua, Wang Shikong, and Fang Qingshan were declared innocent. Geng Huatang, because he feared punishment, committed suicide in the detention center of the police department during the period awaiting judgment.</p>
<p>The public prosecution was not accepted for review. Afterwards, Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu appealed against the original judgment and requested approval from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to have the case sent back for retrial. After repeated court sessions and investigations by Wang Gangxu, the Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, and investigations were conducted with various agencies, organizations and Putuo Mountain Baobentang temples, etc., and all details were sought. After a year and a half, twelve court sessions were held. Although the defendants overturned their original confessions, denied participation in the kidnapping, and hired lawyers to defend them, they were ultimately found guilty based on conclusive evidence, making it impossible to conceal the facts. The debate was declared concluded on the 7th of this month, and a date was set for announcing the verdicts, as reported in detail in previous reports. Yesterday was the date for the pronouncement of the verdicts. At around 10 AM, Judge Wang, accompanied by clerk Zheng Rong, arrived at Criminal Court One, ordered Zheng and the other four defendants to be brought before the court. After a brief inquiry into their ages and origins, he</p>
<p>Announced the Judgment: Except for Zheng, the original sentence was upheld. Shang, Liu, and Wu's original sentences were revoked, and the principal sentence was re-sentenced: Zheng Tangsheng was sentenced to death for repeatedly helping to kidnap and extort ransom, and deprived of his public rights for life; Receiving stolen goods (referring to the ransom money received) was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The death sentence was carried out and deprived of his public rights for life. Shang Zhen was sentenced to life imprisonment for continuing to help kidnap and extort ransom and deprived of his public rights for life. Liu Yimin and Wu Shaoting were each sentenced to life imprisonment for repeatedly helping to kidnap and extort ransom and deprived of their public rights for life; Conspiracy to commit murder was sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Each of them will be executed for life imprisonment, deprived of his public rights for life. When Zheng and others heard the verdict, they all bowed their heads silently. When the bailiff took them back to the prison, only Zheng's elderly father and his wife brought Zheng's eldest son (over ten years old) and four-year-old child, and Zheng's concubine, Chen, etc.</p>
<p>Wept in Silence While watching Zheng being taken back into custody. When they went to the detention center to visit and comfort him, Zheng shouted from inside the iron bars of the prison to his father, wives, concubines, and beloved sons, telling them not to be sad, and saying that everyone in the world inevitably dies, and since he had committed a crime, he had no regrets about dying, but he hoped that his relatives and friends would take care of his elderly father, wives, and concubines, seek a stable life, cultivate his two sons, and study hard so that they could serve the country in the future. A dying man's words are good, and a dying bird's song is sad, which made the bystanders feel sympathetic and compassionate. The major kidnapping case that shocked both Tianjin and Shanghai has also come to an end. It is also heard that Shang, Liu, and Wu also committed similar cases in the Public Concession. Because the Second Special Court had already sentenced them to death at that time, they did not request the transfer for trial. Now that the Second Special Court's retrial has resulted in the three defendants being sentenced to life imprisonment, it is feared that they will request the transfer for trial in the future.</p>

<p>Liang Su, a Cantonese man, aged forty, the head clerk of the Guang Yu Rong Customs Brokerage firm at 212 North Jiangxi Road, had been working for the firm for many years. The previous morning at 10:30 AM, manager Chen Tianzi instructed him to take a draft of four hundred and ten dollars from the Shanghai Bank Hongkou Branch and a draft of fifty dollars from the China Industrial Bank to collect cash, as the other employees of the firm were out conducting business. He first went to the Shanghai Bank and collected the money as requested. However, after obtaining this large sum of money, he suddenly had a wild idea and went to the gambling den at Sanduoli in the Chinese territory on North Sichuan Road to make a final gamble, hoping to get lucky. However, Heaven did not grant his wish, and he lost everything. In a moment of desperation, Liang decided to go all in and rushed to the Industrial Bank to collect another fifty dollars in Yuan coins, intending to launch another battle. However, the money was to be paid to Mr. Tong, a Hakka, who had insufficient deposits and was returned. Liang immediately fled to his home at No. 100 Siwenli on the Great World Bend Road, trying to figure out a solution. By noon, manager Chen realized that Liang had not returned and feared that something had happened, so he went to both banks to investigate and discovered the incident. He immediately reported it to the Hongkou Police Department, which dispatched detective Feng Qi to investigate. He secretly went to Liang's home and arrested him, taking him to the police station. He confessed that he had gambled everything away in Sanduoli. The police notified the Public Security Bureau, who dispatched detectives to arrest several people.

<p>Li Weici, a young woman residing in a village, 25 years old, recently filed a lawsuit in the local court against her birth mother, Li Qiao, accusing her of obstructing her inheritance, requesting a judgment to order an appropriate allocation. The gist of her lawsuit is as follows: "When my father, Li Luji, passed away, I was only eight years old, and I married at the age of twenty-three. My father, during his lifetime, had an affair with a woman named Xu from a iron shop in this town. My father was very fond of the plaintiff and sent her to school from an early age, giving her higher education, hoping that she would be no different from men. Before his death, he also instructed my birth mother to give me property, repeatedly urging her to give the plaintiff four tenths of the inheritance." After the court accepted the case, Judge Sun Jikang opened the court yesterday morning and summoned the parties for trial. The plaintiff, Li Weici, appeared in court with her lawyer, Wang Rumei. The defendant, Li Qiao, and Li Xu also appeared in court with their lawyer, Zhou Ziying, to present their defense. First, Li Weici testified to the previous events, followed by Li Qiao, who testified that she was 48 years old and that when her husband passed away, he did say that four tenths of the property should be given to the plaintiff, but if it were given all at once, it would affect our future lives. The official asked about the amount of property, and she replied that there were over 120 mu of land and four houses. The official asked how much each mu was worth, and she replied that it was about 50 yuan. Finally, Li Xu testified that she was 28 years old, was Li Luji's concubine, and had a son named Da Ren, who was seventeen years old. All of the late husband's inheritance should be inherited by my son. What evidence does the plaintiff have to request the distribution of the inheritance this time? I do not want to analyze it now, please investigate. The official received the testimony, instructing the plaintiff to pay the litigation fees and then schedule another joint hearing.</p>

<p>Ganpu, Zhejiang, suffered a severe drought last year. This spring, flowers, fruits, beans, and wheat were hit by frost, rain, and snow, making the people even more impoverished. Wu Xiahu of the town wrote a letter to his fellow villagers, saying: "Since our Ganpu suffered a rice pest infestation in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, years of famine have followed, and the burden is extremely heavy. The people have nothing to cover themselves with. Last year, we suffered the most severe drought, and the disaster situation was so tragic that it cannot be fully described in words or with pen and ink. Although Mr. Lu Bohong, Chen Jiongwen, Wu Linkun, Cheng Fupi, Chen Peiyuan, Zhou Xinbo, Bu Bosun, Wang Shenfu, Zhou Shuyuan, Zhao Wenxiang and others have worked together to provide disaster relief, it is still insufficient. Furthermore, the spring flowers that farmers were hoping for a bumper harvest have now been almost completely destroyed by frost. Now, the farmers have no strength to plant seeds, and more than 30,000 disaster victims are crying out for food. The rural and urban areas are closely related. Please, fellow villagers, quickly rise up to provide disaster relief!"</p>

They also requested a prompt reply from the Municipal Government. Mr. Yú expressed that the Mayor was already aware of the workers' suffering and had instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to handle the matter quickly, assuring that the Bureau was not being negligent. The Social Affairs Bureau had already submitted a document requesting the Mayor's approval, and it was hoped that the factory could be reopened. At most, a concrete response would be given in four days, and the representatives were asked to return and reassure the workers.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Rickshaw Puller Hangs Himself; Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association Investigates the Truth <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association, upon learning of the news report that a public rickshaw puller named Liú Diànyuán committed suicide due to a failed registration, dispatched investigators to ascertain the truth in order to provide relief to his family. It was learned that the rickshaw puller had previously pulled a public rickshaw for Zhāng Lìjì's rickshaw company three years ago. In the last three years, he had switched to pulling a private rickshaw for Mr. Sòng Wénxiáng, an employee of Tài Yǐ Malt Extract Company. On January 16 of this year, he applied for a private rickshaw registration at the Municipal Council Rickshaw Committee, application number 17364, registered under the name Liú Ā'èr (i.e., Dìyuán or Diànyuán). He went to the Xīnzha Road registration office, but due to poor eyesight, the registration office instructed him to return for a re-examination a week later. However, the next day (January 17), Liú instructed his brother-in-law, Wáng Zhèngxīng (also known as Āfú), to go to the Municipal Council Rickshaw Committee to collect private rickshaw application number 17384 and register it. He himself did not go for the re-examination. Recently, Liú Diànyuán, due to excessive debts accumulated over time and unable to cope, conceived a pessimistic thought and hanged himself in the middle of the night on April 1. After the Mutual Aid Association investigated the truth, it was determined that he was a private rickshaw puller and not a public rickshaw puller, and therefore not entitled to the Association's relief benefits.</p>

<p>In terms of occupational breakdown, there were 56 accidents in the machinery and metal industry, with no fatalities, but many electrical injuries. There were 20 accidents in the textile industry, with one fatality. There were 16 accidents in the clothing industry, with one fatality. There were 16 accidents in the chemical industry. There were 4 accidents in public utilities, with one fatality. There were 13 accidents in the transportation industry, with one fatality.

In addition, 31 accidents were caused by falling objects, and 25 accidents were caused by falls, with two fatalities.</p>
<p>Worker fatigue due to long hours was one of the causes of accidents. One worker, who had been in the factory since 6:00 PM, tripped over a machine part at 6:00 AM the next morning, resulting in a bone fracture. Another fourteen-year-old female worker, working until 2:00 AM, sat on a motor out of exhaustion. When the foreman called her, she mistakenly inserted her fingertip into the machine casing, causing it to be crushed.</p>
<p>The lack of protective devices on machinery makes it easy for clothing, sleeves, and hair to be caught and cause injury. Several factories have already begun protective work.</p>

The entire book is priced at 4 jiao and distributed by the Buddhist Bookstore on Jiāozhōu Road, Shanghai, and its branches in various locations.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Degree Conferral Law <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th) The Legislative Yuan held its 12th meeting on the morning of the 12th. 69 members, including Dai Xiujun, were present, with Sun Ke presiding and Liang Hancao as Secretary-General. The only item discussed was the "Degree Conferral Law," which was resolved to be passed with amendments according to the review report of the Legal System Committee. The draft Degree Regulations was resolved by the Yuan meeting on May 18, 1929 to be reviewed by members such as Dai Xiujun. Subsequently, at the Yuan meeting on July 16 of the same year, according to the review report of member Dai and others, it was submitted for discussion and resolved to be sent back to the original review committee for review. At the Yuan meeting on July 12, 1930, member Dai and others submitted the re-reviewed case and attached implementing regulations for review. The Yuan meeting then resolved to proceed with the review. At the Yuan meeting on November 8 of the same year, based on the proposal of Wei Tingsheng, the case was again submitted to the original review committee, along with members Jiao Yitang and Luo Ding, for review. By the time of the Yuan meeting on December 4 of the same year, member Dai and others submitted the re-reviewed case, changing the "Degree Conferral Law" to "Doctoral Degree Conferral Law," to the meeting. The Yuan then resolved to proceed with the review. In May 1933, the National Government sent a letter urging the speedy formulation of degree regulations, so it was again submitted to the Legal System Committee for review. Subsequently, the National Government issued the "Principles of the Degree Conferral Law" and the "Draft of the Degree Conferral Law" to the Yuan, which were submitted to the committee for review together. Now, the review has finally been completed and submitted to the meeting for passage. The case has lasted for six years, and can be said to be a difficult birth. At today's meeting, when deliberating on this case, Xi Chaojun and Dai Xiujun first reported on the review process separately. Then, the second reading began. Except for some debate among the members on Article 6, which stipulates that those with special contributions to scholarship may also be candidates for a doctoral degree, there were no other objections. Zhou Wei, Luo Yunyan, and others argued that the scope of the article, which stipulates that those with special writings or inventions in scholarship and those who have served as professors at universities or independent colleges for more than three years are eligible to be candidates for a doctoral degree, was too broad and could lead to abuse and harm the reputation of the nation. Cheng Zhonghang, Zhong Tianxin, Di Ying, and others argued that the provision was intended to encourage those with special contributions to scholarship, and that the current university organization law strictly limits the qualifications of professors, so there would be no abuse of the nation's reputation. Therefore, they firmly advocated maintaining the original proposal. The chairman then put it to a vote. Only five people supported the proposal of Zhou and Luo. As a result, the original proposal was passed. The meeting adjourned at 11 AM.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the National Reading Campaign, organized by the Chinese Cultural Reconstruction Association. The association specially invited Tao Baichuan to lecture on how to study Party Principles at Zhongxi Radio. Today, from 3:15 PM to 3:45 PM, the association has invited Li Ximou, Dean of the Science College of National Jinan University, to lecture on how to study natural science at Zhongxi Radio. The full text of Tao Baichuan's lecture is recorded below:</p>
<p>Superficial Research. Ladies and gentlemen, today the Chinese Cultural Reconstruction Association invited me to lecture on how to study Party Principles. The so-called Party Principles, of course, refer to the Three Principles of the People of the Chinese Kuomintang. So, how to study Party Principles is how to study the Three Principles of the People of the Chinese Kuomintang. There are two ways to study the Three Principles of the People of the Chinese Kuomintang: one is superficial research, and the other is in-depth research. Now, let's talk about the method of superficial research. The so-called origin of the Three Principles of the People is the draft of Sun Yat-sen's speeches at Guangzhou University in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, including the three aspects of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. There are six lectures on nationalism, six lectures on democracy, and four lectures on people's livelihood. These sixteen lectures contain the essence of the entire theory of the Three Principles of the People. This is a must-read book for studying the Three Principles of the People. However, a complete doctrine must include two parts: one is the theoretical system, and the other is the method of practice. A doctrine is not complete if it only has a method of practice without profound theories, or if it only has profound theories without a method of practice. The Three Principles of the People has its profound theories and, of course, its methods of practice.</p>
<p>Methods of Practice. The method of practice of the Three Principles of the People is the National Reconstruction Program, which includes three parts. The first is Sun Wen's Doctrine, which is psychological reconstruction. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in view of the fact that people generally suffer too deeply from the poison of "knowing is difficult, acting is easy," believed that the reason why China had failed in everything for thousands of years was entirely due to the poison of "knowing is difficult, acting is easy." Therefore, he advocated knowing is easy, acting is difficult, to correct the erroneous psychology of the Chinese people for thousands of years. He provided many pieces of evidence and explained many principles to prove the correctness of knowing is easy, acting is difficult. The second is the Industrial Plan. Given China's vast land and abundant resources, with wealth hidden in the earth, yet the people suffer hardship and lack means of livelihood, he provided detailed plans for China's agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation, and the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the Industrial Plan, completing a great industrial plan. The third is the Fundamentals of Democracy. China claims to have 470 million people, yet they are like a heap of loose sand, without unity. They only sweep the snow from their own doors and do not care about the frost on other people's roofs. There is no concept of unity at all, and group life is, of course, out of the question. Therefore, in the Fundamentals of Democracy, Mr. Sun stipulated the methods of assembly and association, the order of meetings and discussions, and so on. Therefore, "Sun Wen's Doctrine" is to transform the people's psychology, the "Industrial Plan" is to build the nation's economy, and the "Fundamentals of Democracy" is to guide the people in cooperation and collaboration. In addition to the National Reconstruction Program, there is also the Outline of National Reconstruction. Although this book has only 25 articles, it details the goals of national reconstruction, the procedures of national reconstruction, and how to solve the problems between nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. It also specifies how to implement the three stages of military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government. In just a few hundred words, it provides a complete outline and summary for us. It can be said that the Outline of National Reconstruction is entirely based on the Three Principles of the People and the National Reconstruction Program, and it is a complete national construction plan. In addition to the above two books, there is also the Method for Implementing Local Self-Government. In this book, Mr. Sun gave a concise explanation of the importance of local self-government and the methods of its implementation. It must be known that local self-government is the fundamental work of national construction. If local self-government cannot be completed, other constructions are out of the question. The saying "cultivate oneself, regulate one's family, govern the country, and pacify the world" means that everything should be approached with a broad perspective and start from small things. Local self-government is the foundation of a country, so we cannot neglect this book. To study the theory of the Three Principles of the People, one must read Mr. Sun's lectures on the Three Principles of the People carefully. To study the methods of the Three Principles of the People, one must read the National Reconstruction Program, the Outline of National Reconstruction, and the Method for Implementing Local Self-Government.</p>
<p>Philosophical Research. The above is the method of superficial research, and now I will talk about the method of in-depth research. There are three methods of in-depth research: first, research from a philosophical perspective; second, research from a historical perspective; and third, comparative research. The so-called research from a philosophical perspective is to study the ontology of the Three Principles of the People. A complete doctrine must have a method of observing the past, a plan for transforming the present, and an ideal goal for the future. Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that there was a fundamental force dominating and driving everything in the history of the past and the evolution of all societies. From a historical perspective, we can see that the evolution from hunting and gathering societies to nomadic societies, from nomadic societies to agricultural societies, and then to industrial societies, from barbarism to civilization, is all driven by a great force, which is people's livelihood. To study the Three Principles of the People from a philosophical perspective, one must study Mr. Sun's view of history based on people's livelihood, which is the historical view of vitality. There are two major schools of philosophy: idealism and materialism. Mr. Sun's philosophical foundation is neither idealism nor materialism, but vitality. As for the detailed explanation of vitality, how it differs from idealism and materialism, and why it is superior to materialism and idealism, I will discuss it later due to time constraints today.</p>
<p>Research from the Perspective of the Times. The second method of research is to focus on the perspective of the times, that is, to research from a historical perspective. It is important to know that every doctrine has its historical background, and it is by no means the fantasy of scholars at their desks or in their studies. Only when national problems arise does nationalism emerge. Only when democratic problems arise does democracy emerge. If China today had no problems of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood, Mr. Sun would never have advocated the Three Principles of the People. Because the Three Principles of the People meet the needs of the times, the doctrine itself is entirely aimed at the needs of the national conditions and the trend of the world. Various policies and programs based on the doctrine are, of course, established in response to the requirements of a certain time and environment, and can also change with changes in a certain time and environment. This is the second method of researching the Three Principles of the People from a historical perspective.</p>
<p>Comparative Research. The third method of researching the Three Principles of the People is to start from a comparative perspective. Today, at the same time and in the same space, many doctrines are presented before us, including nationalism, communism, anarchism, cosmopolitanism, and socialism. Their theories are different, and their methods are different. How can we believe in the Three Principles of the People and not believe in other doctrines? Why are other doctrines not suitable for China, while only the Three Principles of the People is suitable? To have a deep understanding of these issues, we must conduct in-depth research. Only then can our faith be firm, and our revolutionary path can be firmly grasped. For example, a comparison between nationalism and state-ism, a comparison between nationalism and cosmopolitanism, a comparison between democracy and anarchism, a comparison between democracy and democracy, a comparison between the principle of people's livelihood and capitalism, and a comparison between the principle of people's livelihood and communism are all worth studying in depth in order to arrive at correct conclusions and establish our correct faith.</p>
<p>Introduction to Research Books. The methods of studying the Three Principles of the People have been briefly described above. Now, I will introduce several research books to you. Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People, National Reconstruction Program, Outline of National Reconstruction, and Method for Implementing Local Self-Government are, of course, must-reads. I will now introduce some reference books to you. For superficial research, there is my Three Principles of the People: An Overview and Mr. Zhou Fohai's The Theoretical System of the Three Principles of the People. For in-depth research, Chen Lifu's The Vitalism can be used for philosophical research, and the world history and national history of the past century must be consulted for research from the perspective of the times. Hu Hanmin's The Operational Nature of the Three Principles of the People is also a reference book that we must read. That is all.</p>

He was instructed to immediately inform all staff of the bureau and the principals or academic directors of all public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, the principals of supplementary schools and mass education schools, and the responsible persons of the City Education Association and social education organizations to attend on time. It is understood that in addition to notifying all staff to attend on time, the Education Bureau also published a notice in the newspaper announcing that all public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, supplementary schools, mass education schools, and responsible persons of the City Education Association and social education organizations should attend. The City Government expects a large number of people to attend that day and fears that the Zhabei public buses will not be able to accommodate them, so it has arranged several special buses on Baoshan Road to pick them up. Therefore, in addition to taking public buses, attendees can also take the special buses. It is reported that the Education Bureau will also send staff to take care of things at the intersection of Baoshan Road.</p>

<p>In order to enable students to understand the situation of social organizations, the Shanghai College of Law and Politics has organized a graduation trip during the spring break of this semester, led by professors, to visit and observe various places in Beijing and Hangzhou. More than 80 students who went to Hangzhou a few days ago have already returned to Shanghai. It is said that in addition to visiting various institutions in Hangzhou, they were also honored by Chairman Huang Shaoxiong, who gave them a personal speech. The students who went to Beijing are also scheduled to return to school today. It is said that the expenses for this trip were all personally donated by President Zhang Shi and others of the college. This move is still a pioneering one in the college.</p>

<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>Culture is very important in modern life. Comparing our culture with that of Europe and the United States, we are very backward. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effort. This is well known and does not need to be said.</p>
<p>Those engaged in cultural activities include education, academic organizations, etc., but the publishing industry is particularly important. All cultural activities, whether related to thinking or practice, whether related to improvement or popularization, can be seen in the publishing industry. Therefore, to understand our cultural situation, we must review the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Our publishing industry has a considerable range. Government, schools, social groups, bookstores, and individuals are all participating. Needless to say, among these participants, bookstores are specialized and at the center.</p>
<p>But regardless of whether you speak specifically from the perspective of bookstores or generally, our publishing industry has various shortcomings, which are very obvious. Benefits? There seems to be nothing. And it doesn't matter if we don't talk about it. The important thing is to point out the shortcomings and find a direction for effort to promote our activities.</p>
<p>In this way, I will begin to analyze the shortcomings of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>In terms of quantity, compared with countries such as Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, the things we publish in a year are far behind. According to Mr. Shu Xincheng's estimate, last year, "the total for the whole year was about 2,160 volumes, 1,716 types, which, compared with the number of publications in various countries in the world in 1931, was only more than Switzerland and ranked 16th. If compared by population, each new publication only accounts for 219,230 people, which is indeed less than any other country." (Cultural Construction, Volume 1, Issue 3, Page 105) Can such a small situation still be called a civilized country?</p>
<p>In terms of quality, there are very few philosophical and scientific works, and profound ones are even rarer. Relatively speaking, there is a little more literature. And the most is the reprinting of ancient books. Some bookstores publish them repeatedly, such as the Twenty-Four Histories, the Twenty-Five Histories, and the Twenty-Six Histories. In addition, they compete to publish textbooks for various levels of schools. Children's books have also become a trend in publishing activities in recent years. Needless to say, pictorials are particularly developed.</p>
<p>From the perspective of both the quantity and quality of publications, it can be said that the current direction of efforts should be these points:</p>
<p>First, increase the quantity;</p>
<p>Second, publish more books on philosophy and science;</p>
<p>Third, pay attention to advanced works.</p>
<p>This is naturally related to China's needs. And there are also reasons for the poverty of past publications in terms of both quantity and quality. Taken together, it is the underdeveloped production, the bankruptcy of the countryside, and an era of overall economic recession, undeveloped education, and the lack of a research atmosphere. There are too many teachers, students, and ordinary people who do not read books and do not buy books. In this situation, it is impossible for publications not to be poor. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e181">My Reading Experience <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xinming</p>
<p>According to my personal reading experience, it seems that there are three methods of reading: first, diligent reading; second, thorough reading; and third, careful reading.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about diligent reading first. "Proficiency comes from diligence, and idleness leads to waste." This is an unchangeable conclusion throughout the ages. Therefore, no matter what books you read, diligent reading is always the first priority. But what I mean by diligent reading here is not advocating a prison-like reading life. It means that you should pay attention to active reading during the reading time; as long as you can concentrate, don't think about "the arrival of the swan," and don't let external affairs disturb your reading and divide your reading time. This is considered diligent reading. I have considerable experience in this regard. Before I was fourteen years old, I didn't understand the benefits of diligent reading. I always liked to play with flowers, trees, insects, and birds. I was in the study room, but my heart was outside the room. I was reciting books, but my heart was remembering the budding roses, the sprouting willows, the ant nests by the wall, and the magpie nests in the trees. As a result, the books I had read were equal to not reading. When I was fourteen years old, I was stimulated by the diligent reading of my classmates and realized that I could not grasp the essentials of the book or make any achievements without diligent reading. So, I changed my attitude of reading while indulging my imagination in external objects; during the reading time, I made full use of this time to read; when it was not reading time, I made full use of this free time to play. This resulted in very good results. Because I was originally the youngest and most academically immature among more than 30 classmates, and my grades were always the lowest in each exam. After diligent reading, my knowledge quickly caught up with my classmates, and by the end of the year, I was able to compete with the oldest and most knowledgeable classmates for first place.</p>
<p>It is not enough to be diligent in reading; in addition to diligence, you must also be thorough. What is thorough reading? "Learning and practicing it from time to time" is thorough reading. Although "learning and practicing it from time to time" is only reviewing the old, if you don't review the old, you can't know the new. Therefore, reviewing the old has great significance in reading. When I was young, when I heard the saying of reviewing the old and knowing the new, I always thought it was meaningless. Later, as I grew older and my memory declined, when I flipped through the books I had read but not thoroughly, they all looked like unfamiliar faces. Only then did I realize that I must read books thoroughly to be able to remember them for a long time. If I let them go lightly, it would be equivalent to not reading them.</p>
<p>Diligent reading and thorough reading are certainly very important, but careful reading is also very important. Careful reading has two meanings. First, it means choosing the books that must be read and not seeking breadth or quantity. Second, it means not letting go of the key points in the book, so that the books you have read are not read in vain. Why? Because seeking breadth and quantity will make the mistake of "coveting more and getting less." The more you want to be a person who knows all books, the more you will end up not knowing any book. Instead of boasting about breadth and quantity, and not being able to read a book carefully, it is better to carefully select the essence of the books to read and ensure that useful time is not wasted on indiscriminate reading. I remember when I was twenty-one or two years old, I liked to read poetry indiscriminately. I always thought that the more I read, the better my own poetry would be. Unexpectedly, the result was that the more I read, the more my own poetry became patchwork. Later, after I suddenly realized this, I spent more than a year studying Tang poetry carefully and without distraction, and I got unexpected gains. The poems signed "Wandering King" are now actually honored to be circulated for a while, which is the result of more than a year of careful study of Tang poetry without distraction.</p>
<p>In short, in the matter of reading, you must combine the three methods of diligence, thoroughness, and care to achieve considerable results. If you don't use these three methods to read, the effect will certainly not be great. The reason why people in the past sighed with "exhausting the classics with white hair" is that they only knew diligent reading and thorough reading, but did not know careful reading. Since the result of not knowing careful reading is that you will be unsuccessful even with white hair, then we should know to draw inferences from one instance and think of the result of only knowing careful reading but not knowing diligent reading and thorough reading.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Zhou Zuoren's "Origins of New Chinese Literature" <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Fuquan</p>
<p>Published by the Renwen Bookstore in Beiping, Actual Price Five Jiao</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren's "Origins of New Chinese Literature" is an important work in recent years. Of course, Mr. Zhou's literary views represent a part of the scholars; and I think the importance of this work does not lie in this, but in the advocacy of "belles-lettres". The high-profile Gong'an School and Jingling School and their advocates are in this book; the one that makes a promotional introduction to Shen Qitian's "A Selection of Modern Prose" is this book ("A Selection of Modern Prose" was previously named "Ice and Snow Sketches" and was selected by Ba'er, see "Camel Leather"). Of course, the popularity of "belles-lettres" has its own social basis, and even "humorous sketches" (belles-lettres are not necessarily humorous in content, this refers to those whose writing is belles-lettres and whose content is humorous) and even "sly and glib sketches" have their own social basis; and in seeking it on paper, we cannot but trace it back to this work. Yuan Zhonglang, the dead literary style of the Sixteen Masters of the Late Ming Dynasty is popular for a generation - no, fashionable for a while (judging from sales, it is not popular for a generation), all credit and blame must be attributed to this work.</p>
<p>We can say that Mr. Zhou's literary views, from "Literature of People" (this article appeared in "New Youth" and was an important essay at the time, but not many people noticed it) to this work, are consistently the same. Let's not talk about historical issues; Mr. Zhou advocates the literature of "expressing aspirations" (Mr. Zhou opposed "expressing aspirations" to "conveying the Way"). The social basis of the literature of "expressing aspirations" (as Mr. Zhou said) is very clear, which is the so-called "capitalism" and the products of capitalism. Mr. Zhou advocates the literature of "expressing aspirations" based on his consistent spirit since the May Fourth Movement, which is completely correct; then, is not the "humanitarianism" in the "Literature of People," that "humanitarianism," "the Way"? No, no, that is precisely the "aspiration" of the May Fourth era.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Introducing Bacon's "New Organon" <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Du Ruoyi</p>
<p>Published by Xinken Bookstore, Translated by Shen Yinming</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese scholars have been very active in introducing Western culture, but very few of the important works of any field of learning have been translated in their original form. Marx has been introduced for many years and has had a great influence in the ideological world, but "Das Kapital" has not been fully translated to this day. Writers have been talking about Tolstoy, but there is no translation of Tolstoy's great works. Philosophers always talk about Bacon and Kant, but where are the translations of Bacon and Kant's philosophical works? Therefore, the method of introduction by Chinese scholars really makes people feel like grasping at shadows.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the Chinese cultural world today is to show the existing achievements of Chinese and Western cultures to cultural people with genuine goods. What is Confucius's theory? Should it be inherited? Should it be abandoned? What is Marxism? Should it be supported? Should it be opposed? There must always be genuine goods to see, and only after seeing them can decisions be made. Scholars must study monographs when they seek knowledge. It is not enough to simply read some magazines and articles that introduce the superficial aspects. But first of all, there must be monographs to read. Not all scholars know foreign languages, and those who know foreign languages do not necessarily know everything. Therefore, various monographs must have translations. Whoever can translate an important academic masterpiece is a meritorious person in the Chinese cultural world today.</p>
<p>Now I see that Bacon's famous work, "Novum Organum," has a translation, and I am very happy and want to introduce it here.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon was a great British philosopher, proficient in law and economics, and also an astronomer. He was born in London in 1561. At the age of thirteen, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He left the college three years later. In 1582, he became a lawyer. In 1616, he was elected as a member of Parliament. Later, he served as Royal Counsel and Attorney General. In 1618, he became Lord Chancellor at the age of 57. In 1621, he was arrested and imprisoned for bribery. He was pardoned by the King a few days later and devoted himself to research and writing. He died in 1626. He opposed Aristotle's doctrines and wanted to rescue philosophy from the tedious disputes of scholasticism. He advocated directly experiencing nature and taking inductive methods based on observation and experience as the true method of understanding nature. His theories had a great influence on modern science, so he is known as the "father of modern science." His works include Essays, The Advancement of Learning, and New Organon. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Hobby of Reading <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Liuyi</p>
<p>I once read a poem by Francis. Beulloch, the content of which was about reading. The general idea is:</p>
<p>I love books as a drunkard loves wine,</p>
<p>The more I drink, the more I feel the spirit within,</p>
<p>My soul rejoices and is immersed in love,</p>
<p>Raising my glass again, I find the taste inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Wherever I am, books are my companions,</p>
<p>Bringing comfort in times of loneliness,</p>
<p>And friendship in times of solitude.</p>
<p>Books! My treasures,</p>
<p>You are my dearest friends.</p>
<p>Your value is pure,</p>
<p>Your friendship sincere.</p>
<p>Because of you, I can whisper with the sages of the past,</p>
<p>And be close to the talented people of today.</p>
<p>Within, I see much joy and sorrow,</p>
<p>Those joys and sorrows touch my heart.</p>
<p>After reading the original poem, I translated it and wrote it in one of my favorite books. The sentiment of the poem is good, but I do not quite agree with the analogy of the hobby of reading to the attitude of a drunkard towards drinking.</p>
<p>Although those who drink know that alcohol can numb human nature, drunkards still love to drink, not stopping until they are "dead drunk." If readers were to adopt the attitude of a drunkard, I think it would be unsuitable. Reading a lot is certainly good, but one must not read until one is dazed, like being drunk. The best way to drink is to be "slightly tipsy" without getting completely drunk; the best way to read is to become clearer-headed the more one reads, to be able to use the knowledge in the books actively, and not to be bound by the books. Being bound by books is the same as being numbed by alcohol, resulting in becoming a "fossil" of books.</p>
<p>What kind of books should one read? Apart from the books one specializes in, it is advisable to "meander" or "read widely." For example, a person who studies philosophy, in addition to books on philosophy, may wish to expand the scope of their reading to gardening, bird-keeping, etc., and discover knowledge related to philosophy from those books. Wouldn't that be interesting? (April 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Financial Bubble Burst, Gold Speculation Rebound Strong, Fluctuating by $23, Resulting in a Rebound of $8.30 <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was spared from rising and falling, elusive and confusing. The trend had started to reverse, and the speculation was quite fierce. There was a rebound of more than 20 yuan in the middle of the day. Follow-up and intervention by the Central Bank and Qiao Zhibu blocked the rise. A certain bank had silver transported out. After the high, it fell back. Indian silver continued to rise, but Sassoon aggressively covered. In the end, it hovered. Rumors of a silver ban are probably far from the truth. In the early morning, overseas silver markets rose across the board. It was said that after the market closed, the United States bought in at 1.5 additional units. The forward silver price in Monterrey soared by 2.1 cents. Exchange rates rose and fell only slightly. London gold rose by 5.5 pence. However, due to overseas observations that the US government is actively raising silver prices, the Chinese currency system will continue to be chaotic. The argument for China to change its currency system is quite high, which has touched people's hearts and eliminated the short side. Therefore, although pre-market trading opened lower at 42-43 yuan, buyers were eager to buy at low prices, and the price quickly rebounded, rising to over 7 yuan. The morning opening was slightly lower. After opening, due to the flat exchange market, the price rose as soon as it went on the market.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's posted exchange rates were announced, and both British and American currencies rose. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 2.7 points. The gold price standard was lowered to 881 yuan 80 cents. Bankers tended to be conservative and expected that the HSBC rate would not move. It then rose to over 50 yuan outside the customs. Later, due to the unchanged silver equalization tax, buyers were disappointed, and selling began. It fell back by more than 10 yuan. However, major players took the opportunity to cover at low prices. Sassoon also aggressively bought. The situation remained stable, gradually rebounding to over 50 yuan. The trend was firm. Later, rumors such as the prohibition of silver exports rose again. The buying sentiment was激越, and the surface 本涸. Suddenly, a short squeeze occurred, breaking through the 60 yuan mark. The increase was quite俏. Later, major players took advantage of the high price to sell. Qiao Zhibu and the Bank of China and others took advantage of the high price to unload. The exchange rate turned flat, and the price gradually fell back to within 60 yuan. The situation was still stable. At noon, the overall trend hovered around 60 yuan. After the close, the market was more rebellious. The Indian silver market suddenly rose by 1 rupee 5 anna, 1 rupee 3 anna, and 1 rupee 4 anna. The pre-market price immediately fell to 54 yuan and then stabilized slightly. After opening, the price fell due to Qiao Zhibu's unloading, but it soon rose again as Indian silver returned slightly by 7 anna. The Central Bank continued to unload. It was rumored that Datong Bank had 1 million yuan of silver being shipped for export. The domestic market hardened and fell again. However, Sassoon aggressively bought forward contracts, and people's hearts were still stable. It gradually rebounded. Indian silver rose three times by 6 anna. In the end, it presented a hovering situation. Now I will record the market situation in detail:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 846 yuan 80 cents, half a yuan lower than the previous closing. Yuan Mao, Yongchun, Yuanyuan, Yongfu, Yuheng, and Yu Jin immediately rose to 50 yuan. The Central Bank's Customs Gold Unit price announcement fell by 1.7%. Fuxing, Yongda, Yongsheng, Dadecheng sold, falling back to 46 yuan 80 cents. Fuyu, Jiarun, Yuanmao, Yongheng, Yuda, De, Cheng, Fuxing, and Yong still moved forward, rising to 52 yuan 20 cents. Huixiang and Changda took advantage of the high price to sell, falling to 49 yuan 60 cents. Huixiang, Shunmao, Hengyu, and Fuyu still moved forward. Huabi bought 5-month US dollars at 125, rising to 10 yuan 20 cents. Yuqing, Yongfu, Xingyong, Hengyu, Yuxin, and Xiang sold, falling to 5 cents. It was known that HSBC's posted exchange rate did not move, which excited people's hearts. Fuyu, Yingxiang, Hengyu, Dafa, Yongsheng, and Dalai rose to 4 yuan. HSBC came out with 6-month shillings at 6875. Huixiang, Yuqing, and Yong, Yongli, and Hengyu sold off, falling to within 2 yuan. The Central Bank unloaded, and Yingshe, Kang, Wanxing, and Yongli came to sell, breaking below 50 yuan. Huabi Magali offered 7-month shillings at 6875, falling to 48 yuan 30 cents. Yuqing, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yonghengchang, and Yong took advantage of the low price to advance to 51 yuan. Huixiang and Fuxingyong sold to 49 yuan 20 cents. Hengxing and Hengchangyong advanced to 50 yuan 90 cents. The Central Bank's silver equalization tax announcement did not move, causing a strong buying trend. Fuyu, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Richang, Yuanmao, Xiaoshen, Huixiang, Huiyuan and others sold off, falling to 43 and a half yuan. Hongxing, Yicheng, Dacheng, Hengchang, Yongyuanchang and Hengyu advanced to stabilize. Sassoon bought 7-month shillings for 75. Loumao, Dadecheng, Changda, Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, Tongyu, and Runfenfeng advanced, gradually rising to 50 yuan. After that, it once hovered around 9 yuan. Shanghai bought 6-month US dollars for 8125. People's hearts were still good. Yongfeng, Hengyu, Dafa, Yonghui, Xiangda, De, Cheng, Futai and Henglai advanced, rising to 54 yuan. Fuxingyong sold off, falling to 2 and a half yuan. Huiyuan, Hengyu, Dafa, Yongfuxingyong, and Yingxiang advanced, rising again to 7 and a half yuan. Fuxing, Yong, and Yongli took advantage of the high prices to sell off, falling to 5 yuan 30 cents. After entering, rumors of a ban on silver exports were mixed. Hengyu, Dafa, Yong, Yingxiang, Yuanmao, Yongsheng, Dahengxing, Zhentai, Tongtai, Chang, Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, Yifengshui and others bought up, and the rising trend was激越, rising to 66 and a half yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was exceptionally calm. Market prices were also extremely sluggish, and trading volume decreased significantly. The 1996 public bonds also appeared stable. Although bond number 35 continued to be sold off, retail investors showed considerable demand, which helped stabilize market prices. The sentiment within the exchange was mixed. Short sellers were wary of foreign loans, fearing that positive news might emerge, and were hesitant to take bold positions. Long position holders were concerned that credit conditions might remain tight. Given the unchanged US silver purchase policy and the rising silver prices, there was little hope for a recovery in commercial prospects. This situation was unlikely to change in the short term. Only when the defenses of both bulls and bears weaken will there be fluctuations in market prices. Yesterday's activity showed no clear trend. Prices varied across different trades and were not uniform. The price differences generally did not exceed five fen or one jiao (tenths of a yuan). At most, they were only two jiao. Many bonds showed no movement at all. Only the 1996 public bonds saw significant selling of bond number 35, but due to substantial retail support, prices were maintained and even slightly improved by five fen or one jiao. The total trading volume was 8.306 million yuan. The following is a table comparing the results of price changes: (Unit: yuan, Trading Unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending firmer, with a slight uptrend emerging. Market sentiment is somewhat positive, as American cotton and all three grades of cotton yarn are rising together, boosting confidence. However, an examination of overseas yarn conditions reveals that they are rising with silver prices, completely driven by silver. Foreign firms, however, are holding their short positions steady, it is said.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster (Yarn) Rises by Seven or Eight Jiao</p>
<p>Before the opening of the benchmark yarn market, some discussions suggested the possibility of an increase, as American cotton surged by 40 points per pound. Although silver prices rose sharply, gold prices did not fall. Therefore, at the opening, all months rose by three, four, or five jiao. However, when trading reached the second or third round, the situation suddenly loosened. There were few buyers in the market. Many said that certain yarns were being transported to inland areas and sold at discounted prices, which naturally constrained local yarns. Consequently, sentiment became flat and prices fell again. As a result, each month's closing price was up or down by one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, buying interest suddenly surged, and available supply in the market appeared scarce again. The gold market closed higher, and there were rumors that certain matters were being revisited. These rumors were all beneficial to buyers. The market became increasingly tight. As a result, each month rose by five, six, seven, or eight jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,000 bales from Suilong, 600 bales from Yida, 400 bales from Zhenda, 650 bales from Yichang, 1,100 bales from Shengyuan, 850 bales from Deji, 450 bales from Dafeng, and 450 bales from Dachangcheng. Purchases included 550 bales from Mingde, 650 bales from Hexing, 450 bales from Guda, 400 bales from Yuanyi, 1,000 bales from Changfeng, 1,200 bales from Runkang, 850 bales from Hengchang, and 400 bales from Changyu.

<p>Cotton Prices Have Fallen for Two Consecutive Days, But Today Suddenly Show Signs of Recovery. The Reason Is That American Cotton Has Soared by 40 Points Per Pound, and Indian Cotton Has Also Risen by Four Rupees. The Surge in Overseas Cotton Industries Is All Due to the Silver Issue. In the Afternoon, News of Higher Gold Prices Improved Confidence.</p>
<p>Zheng Benchmark (Cotton) Bulls Increase Their Positions</p>
<p>At the opening of the benchmark cotton market, prices for all months showed lively increases. American cotton rose sharply by 40 points per pound, and Indian cotton rose by two, three, or four rupees. This boosted confidence, and the market situation appeared somewhat tense. However, when trading reached the third closing, it turned weak again. One explanation was that even though American cotton had risen, the sharp rise in silver prices made it difficult for prices to rise significantly. The market therefore eased. As a result, prices for all months rose by one to two jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, prices suddenly tightened. The black market price of Indian cotton rose by three rupees. In addition to the Gold Standard (Jinzi) group purchasing 12,000 dan (a unit of weight), the equalization tax remained unchanged, and there were rumors of a ban on silver exports. This caused buying interest to surge, and bulls increased their positions frequently. The market became increasingly firm. As a result, prices for all months rose by two to two and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 5,600 dan from Dafu, 2,200 dan from Jifeng, 3,100 dan from Tongji, 1,500 dan from Suilong, 2,200 dan from Zhenda, 2,100 dan from Gengfeng, 1,200 dan from Yuanda, 2,600 dan from Tongxing, 4,800 dan from Xiacheng, and 3,500 dan from Shengyuan. Purchases included 2,100 dan from Jifeng, 2,600 dan from Hexing, 3,000 dan from Changyu, 12,000 dan from Runkang, 2,800 dan from Dachang, 3,600 dan from Tonghe, 2,600 dan from Xincheng, 3,500 dan from Changhe, and 2,900 dan from Changfeng. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market rose due to positive news from Liverpool. Broad buying led to increases of ten to twenty-six points in all months. Profit-taking by bulls in the middle of the session caused a slight weakening. In the afternoon, buoyant conditions in the cloth market improved confidence again, and the closing trend was firm. Spot prices rose by forty points, while futures rose by twenty-four to thirty-seven points. Spot English cotton rose by one point, and futures rose by fourteen to fifteen points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to selling of April and May contracts by European exporters, but later rose due to buying by speculators and positive telegrams from Liverpool. Pingguoer rose by 2.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 3.5 to 3.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 4.25 to 5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 11th):</p>

The spot situation is becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Grains: US Wheat Leads to Positive Futures for Flour and Wheat <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, showed initial stability followed by increases in prices for all months. Overseas wheat quotes showed gains of around three to six jiao in Chicago and eight fen to one jiao in Canada. At the opening, as the weather had cleared and conditions improved, some profit-taking bulls sold briskly, causing the market to stabilize slightly. After the second trade, strong buying by clients caused prices to rise again, gaining close to one fen for near-term contracts and three fen for longer-term contracts compared to the previous day's closing prices. However, manufacturers seized this opportunity to sell briskly. By the afternoon opening, as manufacturers continued to sell and buyer appetite weakened, all months saw price declines, with the highest drop being one fen. According to industry insiders, the current weather is unpredictable, and spot goods still need to be priced at five fen above the standard, so they do not expect prices to fall significantly in the short term. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 1 fen and 2.5 li, May rose by 1 fen, June rose by 1 fen and 2.5 li, July rose by 2 fen, August rose by 1 fen and 7.5 li, and September rose by 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the morning opening, showed initial stability followed by increases in prices for all months. Overseas wheat quotes showed gains of around three to six jiao in Chicago and eight fen to one jiao in Canada. At the opening, as overseas wheat showed mixed gains and losses and the weather was good, prices for all months showed little change compared to the previous day. After the second trade, strong buying interest from outside the industry and a rebound in the flour market caused prices to gain three to five fen. By the afternoon opening, trading remained lively for all months. As the weather was still difficult to predict, confidence continued. However, if the weather becomes warm and calm, confidence may weaken slightly. As a result, near-term contracts rose by 2 fen, July rose by 5 fen, August rose by 6 fen, and September rose by 6 fen. The spot wheat market remained tight. As arrivals were weak and inventories were low, asking prices were three to five fen higher. 1,000 bags of Shandong wheat opened at a price of 3.9 yuan, which was taken by Fuxin.</p>

<p>The wheat bran market has been trending downwards recently. Since overseas wheat arrivals have been brisk, all factories have seen significant output. Sales channels for overseas wheat have been quiet for a long time, with few inquiries. Inland demand is also sporadic. Therefore, wheat bran from all factories is exceptionally loose and cheap. It is said that prices have fallen to 2.5 yuan for Fuxin bran and 2.467 yuan for miscellaneous bran, which is more than one jiao lower than before.</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the source of various groups was still number 25 or 26 (a total of more than 7,000 shi). Sales in the local market were also flat. Therefore, the initial market trend was weak, and prices were frequently lowered. Later in the session, the Qingdao and Weihai groups suddenly purchased more than 1,000 packages, which gradually stabilized sentiment. As a result, the price of various thick japonica rice was reduced by several fen to about one jiao, depreciating by one to one and a half jiao. The trend is showing signs of becoming flat and weak.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, the source of various groups in Hexia was more than 20 numbers. Sales of various goods in the market were sluggish. In the afternoon, only white japonica rice became more active, and the market price of white japonica rice became more active, while the market price of white japonica rice increased by a small margin. The price in the afternoon turned stronger. The price of thin rice was slightly higher by seven or eight fen. The prices of other famous corners were still soft.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, the customerization of foreign rice remained active. Only mainland continued to run. In addition, there are also social interactions. Yangtze River and Beiyang gangs are paying for inventory, and no new transactions have been inquired about. Therefore, the market is slightly stable. However, local office is not light, and also welcome Saigon. Each rice, this street also has a high Xixiang inquiry, so Saigon. The rice continued to see an increase of 35 points, while the others remained stable. The total day opened 6,000 packs of Saigon rice, 1,000 packs of Small Chop, and more than 2,000 packs of  . Return futures 500 tons, Kecian 500 packs, Kecian Inland has faded, the market has also turned flat.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Longjing new tea has been on the market these days, but due to the cold weather, the production is not prosperous.

<p>The white tung oil market in Hankou has fallen and rebounded, and was carried in the previous issue of this newspaper. It is because the fall is too fast, and the reaction is easy. Yesterday, this port connected with three or four Han electricity, and the price soared, from 35 yuan to 36 yuan to 37 yuan 4 jiao to 39 yuan. In one day, it increased by four yuan, which is a new record that has never been seen before.

<p>Almost every young person likes to recall the past, yearn for the future, and curse the reality. Because the past is like a fruit of remonstrance, giving people a sweet aftertaste; the future is like a sugarcane, the more you eat, the sweeter it becomes, and the more flavorful it becomes later; only reality is worthy of being cursed, hated, not knowing how to grasp reality is to create happiness for the future and the best material for remembering the past.</p>
<p>When Sister Spring hasn't married us, we are despite suffering from unrequited love, and we think how lovely and how beautiful she is! When she marries us, we put her aside, never return to the embrace of nature, the green world, and caress her, and be affectionate with her. When her spring passes and her beauty fades, we immediately write about her and express her in words, to mourn her, and sigh for her. I don't know if it is Sister Spring who has failed us, or we have failed Sister Spring!</p>
<h3 id="e199">Talking About Touring the Lake <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Master Shiyuan</p>
<p>I have been staying in Kangyuan for three or four springs without realizing it. Although I dare not say that I am an old horse who knows the way for the "West Lake," which has been known for its beauty since ancient times, I am confident that I have a considerable understanding of it. Taking advantage of this time when the flowers are fragrant and tourists are woven, I will briefly, objectively, and concretely talk about the lake scenery, providing a reference for the ladies who are obsessed with the scenery of West Lake.</p>
<p>The Ten Scenes of West Lake are the central goals that everyone yearns for. In fact, these so-called ten scenes are mostly the mysteries that Emperor Qianlong made. There is a "Royal Monument" in each scene. Most of the ten scenes are abstract and empty. In other words, they do not escape the "poetic" and "fantasy" of Chinese literati, and they cannot come up with real evidence. In the "Willow Waves and Orioles" in the Ten Scenes, there are few willows, and even if there are, the orioles have nowhere to live. "Broken Bridge Remaining Snow" has now become a Kangzhuang Bridge, and cars pass without hindrance. "Su Causeway in the Spring Dawn", I don't know what it refers to? "Double Peaks Piercing the Clouds" must be viewed from a large area, but there are more than just double peaks that pierce the clouds. "Curved Courtyard with Lotus in the Breeze", the courtyard is very simple, and lotus flowers are occasionally decorated in summer. "Nanping Evening Bell". The emptiness can be seen from the noun. As for "Leifeng Pagoda in the Evening Glow", there is actually a reason, but unfortunately the tower collapsed ten years ago. It is almost always "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" and "Autumn Moon over the Peaceful Lake". Every moonlit night, the scenery is indeed elegant. "Viewing Fish at Flower Harbor", you don't have to be fooled. The harbor is not a harbor, there are few flowers, and it is rare to have a few fish more than five inches long.</p>
<p>What I said above is not to spoil the fun, it is indeed the real situation. If you really play on the lake, some unknown places have a special flavor. There are also some relatively famous "caves", such as "Huanglong Cave", "Stone House Cave", "Jingu Cave", etc., which are very quiet and elegant and can be visited. Several "Zhuangzi" also have considerable meaning. In addition, the five-colored fish in "Yuquan" and the bamboo in "Yunxi" and "Taoguang" can all be played. The two "Tianzhus" and the "Jingci"... and other Buddhist temple places, the names are indeed deafening, but if you are not a Buddhist disciple, you don't have to go.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Country Wedding Feast <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>In Shanghai, people who are popular? Receiving a wedding invitation from relatives and friends, they throw it on the table without nostalgia. People with more generous economies, beforehand, order the servants to send a generous gift; awkward friends, send it when they eat it. When the wedding day comes, those who have enough friendship, go to say congratulations in the morning; go to see the wedding in the afternoon, and enter the seat in the evening, and it is over after eating a full meal. Eating wedding wine in Shanghai, I really feel that it is a common and monotonous thing.</p>
<p>The situation in the countryside is very different. Not only are the people who have weddings killing pigs and chickens, and are busy; but also the people who eat wedding wine are also eating big fish and meat non-stop. Within a month before the event, they either rock the boat or pull up their pants, inviting relatives to the east and shouting neighbors to the west. Their invitation is a verbal appointment, and it is rare for a few families to use a red paper post. Relatives come first, and neighbors come the day before the official day. They sent a gift of two or four jiao, and very few have two yuan, supporting the old and carrying the young, the whole family came; moreover, they ate from breakfast to night meal. The wine feast on the previous day always uses fresh meat, half-cooked and non-crispy fresh fish, and the five internal organs in the pig's belly. Inside the house, on the ground, there are many tables densely arranged; large glasses of wine, large bowls of rice, gobbling, the bottom of the bowl facing the sky; not enough to eat, guests can also take a large bowl and add to the kitchen</p>
<p>The dishes on the official day are slightly more delicate. Although there are no valuable things such as shark fin and bird's nest, they will also invite famous and good chefs from the countryside to cook some stir-fries, such as sea cucumber chicken slices; there will also be coarse and sweet Babao rice for refreshments; some fruits and peanuts will also be placed on the corners of the table. This table is called the main banquet, and the people in the countryside also eat politely, but in the end, there is nothing left, and the soup is dry.</p>
<p>In the evening, men, women, old and young, crowded into a new house. The bride sits upright like the land grandmother in the temple, daring not to move or laugh. The bridegroom's face is red, and he is teased by a group of congratulatory guests who are full of wine. Laughing and making noise until three o'clock in the morning, the host took out things like peanuts, melon seeds, water chestnuts, and sugar cane to send them away.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, they will eat and drink all day like the day before. After two days, the wedding feast is over. The money spent by the host family is limited in other aspects, but just taking this food and drink as an example, it accounts for six or seven tenths of the expenditure.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The shoe uppers themselves were mostly made of the finest tribute satin, each in a different color. They were embroidered with various patterns using threads of different colors. These threads were dyed by the silk artisans, saving the expense of purchasing them from outside. However, the threads were so fine that simply by looking at them, one would immediately believe that the embroidery work on the shoe uppers was indeed extremely taxing on the eyes!</p>
<p>The heart of this shoe-making "factory" was the central main hall, filled with all sorts of tools, so many different kinds that I had never seen most of them before. Although I later asked the two old spinster leaders about each one, the names were so numerous and complex that I can't recall them all now. Every time I went there, I had to ask the two old spinsters to take out several pages of newly designed shoe patterns for me to look at. These shoe patterns were indeed very beautiful! To praise them in modern terms, they were truly exquisite drawings. I often admired them so much that I couldn't bear to put them down, wondering how the girls who created these patterns had learned such skills. Some of the drawings were exceptionally neat, looking like real shoes in the eyes of the viewer, as if one could simply take them down and wear them. Moreover, they weren't just monochrome sketches; they were colored drawings, with the colors of the shoe material and the patterns already rendered. When the shoes were eventually made, they would be exactly like the drawings on the paper, just like the sample books prepared by modern fashion companies. (292)</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, Drawing the Curtain to Avoid Guests; Laboring Diligently to Save Lamp Oil, Copying Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Cheng Zhiqian was a person with very modern ideas. However, having come to a place like Xi'an, there were many things he had to be cautious about. A girl like Zhu Yueying came from a feudal society, where it was impossible for women to talk to men under normal circumstances. Now, only because she was desperately poor did she have to come forward and interact with men. Therefore, although he sympathized with her greatly, considering her helplessness, he didn't want to get too close to her. He thought that she must be suffering inwardly while putting on a facade for people. Thinking this way, he consistently maintained this attitude towards Yueying. Seeing Yueying forced by the wind and rain to fall directly into the mud, Yang Huanhua and Hu Saozi only shouted anxiously, unable to bend down to help her. Zhiqian really couldn't bear it any longer, so he rushed forward, regardless of the mud and rain, and jumped directly in front of Yueying. He bent down, grabbed her under the arms, lifted her up, and, supporting and pushing her, led her to the corridor. He said seriously, "You'll catch a cold easily. Quickly go to my room, take off your wet clothes, and ask the tea server to go home and get some clothes for you to change into. I'll wait for you here in the corridor." Yueying had fallen head over heels, already feeling ashamed. Being lifted up and helped to the corridor made her feel like a child. Her face immediately turned as red as pig's blood. Yang Huanhua and Hu Saozi also came over, and seeing her dripping wet, they couldn't help but frown. (181)</p>

<h3 id="e205">Quick Sketch of a Trip to Wuxi <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoci</p>
<p>Among all the counties in the country, Wuxi can be considered the most prosperous. Just looking at the actual situation of its industry and education can deeply convince one of this. Wuxi is not only a model county but also one of the famous scenic spots in the southeast. In the past, I only heard people praising it in this way, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing! Fortunately, this time, during the April 4th Children's Day, I was able to make a special trip to visit, staying for three days and enjoying the scenery before returning. The "Wuxi scenery" of lakes and mountains is indeed unique and worth appreciating and remembering.</p>
<p>I didn't investigate Wuxi's industry, nor did I visit its educational institutions. During this hurried trip, I only toured a few scenic spots. Wuxi's famous scenic spots can be categorized into four areas: (1) the Huishan Scenic Line, (2) the Lakeside Scenic Line, (3) the Urban Scenic Line, and (4) the Rural Scenic Line. This time, I focused on the Huishan and Lakeside areas. Although each of these four areas has its own unique flavor, in my opinion, the urban and rural areas are quite ordinary. The Huishan area is antique but too commercial, while only the Lakeside area, with its vast lakes and mountains and enduring spirit, is truly worth seeing.</p>
<p>The Lakeside area is particularly attractive because it is surrounded by mountains and faces Tai Lake. By arranging the scenery based on this natural landscape and adding artificial embellishments, it outshines other areas. Tai Lake is the third largest freshwater lake in our country, with rolling white waves and scattered islands. It has the famous Seventy-Two Peaks and a reported area of 36,000 hectares, showcasing its magnificent atmosphere. Yuantouzhu is the top scenic spot on the lakeside, with mountains, water, and gardens everywhere. Nearby are Ba Jiang Liao Lun's cliff inscriptions "Horizontal Clouds" and "Embracing Wu and Yue," which aptly describe Tai Lake. The scenery on Yuantouzhu Mountain is beautiful, needless to say. The Tai Lake Villa on the mountaintop faces the lake, and looking out from the heights, one can see the water and sky merging. This tranquil place even gave me a sense of being in paradise.</p>
<p>Leaving Yuantouzhu, I followed the circular lakeside road, reaching the newly built Baojie Bridge at the foot of Baojie Mountain. It spans the lake surface, entirely built of cement, with sixty-three arches, about three miles long, and costing hundreds of thousands. It is said to have been built with donations from the Rong family. About a mile from the bridge is "Li Garden," facing the Wuli Lake and overlooking Guangchang Creek. Its natural terrain and picturesque scenery make the garden's layout and arrangement no less beautiful than the "Ye Garden" in Jiangwan. From here to Meiyuan next to Dumu Mountain, I passed through more than ten miles of winding mountain paths. Sitting in a rickshaw, I was indeed a bit bored. Fortunately, the rural scenery was enough to give one a panoramic view, which was also a pleasant experience for city dwellers. Meiyuan was built by the Rong family. From the hillside to the summit, countless plum trees were planted, and the gentle breeze was incomparably cool. The garden has all sorts of pavilions and towers. At the summit are the Nianqu Pagoda, the Zongjing Villa, and his study. To the east is the Huoran Cave, carved out of the mountain, and the highest point is the golf course. Looking out at Tai Lake, the sails are like crows, offering a unique interest. On the mountainside is the Tai Lake Hotel, exclusively for tourists to stay. I also stayed for two nights this time. Living in the mountains was a first for me.</p>
<p>Wuxi is truly a place where outstanding people gather. Although it has beautiful natural lakes and mountains, without the Rong (Zongjing), Yang (Hanxi), and Wang (Yuqing) families' willingness to donate and manage, Wuxi would not have today's prosperity!</p>

<h3 id="e208">New Type of Carbon Resistor <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>There are commonly three types of fixed resistors in radio equipment. The first type is made of resistance wire wound around a core, the second type is a thin layer of carbon material coated on an insulating substrate, and the third type is the so-called "carbon fixed resistor," made of fine carbon particles mixed with an insulating powder. Among these three types, the first type is accurate and durable, but unfortunately, it is too expensive. The second type, due to manufacturing reasons, has too small a cross-sectional area and is only suitable for resistors that pass a small amount of current. Therefore, in practice, the third type, the carbon fixed resistor, is used most often and has the most potential for development. However, the carbon fixed resistors on the market are not accurate enough in resistance and are not very durable, which is not entirely satisfactory. This is why manufacturers are constantly researching and experimenting to improve their products.</p>
<p>American Lynck Mfg. Co. has now produced a new type of resistor that surpasses the old carbon resistor in both accuracy and durability.</p>
<p>It is said that the biggest reason for the inaccuracy and ease of damage in the old type lies in the inconsistent composition. This is because it is made by mixing fine carbon powder with an insulating material. The resistance is inversely proportional to the amount of carbon powder. The conductive part is only some carbon powder in the difficult-to-insulate material, so once subjected to external heat or shock, the position of the carbon powder inside easily changes, affecting the accuracy of the resistance. This explanation is supported by experiments. In experiments, when an excessive amount of current is passed through, and the interior is observed, starry sparks can be seen. These starry sparks are undoubtedly caused by the excessive current passing through the carbon powder and generating heat. In addition, a cross-sectional photograph of an old-style resistor magnified eighty times under a microscope clearly shows that its surface is granular and porous. Of course, if the surface is not dense, it is easily attacked by moisture, which changes its resistance.</p>
<p>Based on the above results, the raw materials and manufacturing steps of the new type of resistor have been completely reformed. The raw material is made by mixing two kinds of powders with different resistivity. The ratio of these two powders determines the resistance. Therefore, the conductive part is no longer limited to carbon powder as in the old type. During manufacturing, it is thoroughly mixed and then formed into a strip under extreme pressure to ensure its uniform composition and dense surface. In tests, such products, even when subjected to an excessive amount of current, do not generate starry sparks like the old type. At the same time, a cross-section magnified eighty times shows that its surface is much denser. Therefore, the new type of product is much better than the old type. Although it cannot be said to have reached the ideal standard, it is not far off. The following are some comparisons from several experiments:</p>
<p>When the new type is subjected to twice the specified power, or even four times the specified power, its resistance usually changes by only slightly less than one percent, and the maximum is only two percent. It is also not damaged in boiling water. In another experiment, at a temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit, carrying the specified power for 350 hours, the resistance did not change, even when the actual temperature rose to 193 degrees (due to I2R loss). However, in the old type, it had changed by about 4 to 10 percent. (The rest is omitted to save space.) In addition, under the Cathode Ray Test, the new type does not emit noise during use. Furthermore, the contact point between the body of the new resistor and the pigtail has also been improved, so the contact is more perfect than the old type.</p>

<p>— Yang Xuelun</p>
<p>(6) Circuit: Once the components are purchased, assembly can begin. Start with a three-circuit regenerative receiver because it is simple to wire, has few components, and has excellent efficiency. Use 37 or 38 for vacuum tubes for AC, and 30 or 33 for DC. The second step is to add one or two stages of low-frequency amplification, using transformer or resistor coupling. Although the volume of resistor coupling is not as good as that of the transformer, the position occupied by the resistor is economical, the amplification is uniform, and there is no frequency dependence, so it is often used. After you have mastered the low-frequency amplification assembly, you will have gained considerable knowledge and experience. Then, the third step is to add one or two stages of high-frequency amplification, using a tuned radio frequency (t.r.f.) circuit. After this machine is completed, its selectivity, sensitivity, and volume are definitely more than enough for amateur home use.</p>
<p>(7) Assembly Method: Arranging components and soldering wires are important tasks in assembling a radio. It is common to see beginners whose wiring is correct but fail because they have not soldered the wires properly. The high-frequency and detection coils must not be placed in the same magnetic field. It is best to place them at right angles to each other or isolate them with an aluminum shield. In addition, when winding coils, they must be tight and uniform, and the wiring of the screen grids and diodes must be short and not parallel. At the beginning of assembling the wooden box and base, you can reserve space for expansion to avoid having to reassemble everything in the future. It is up to you whether to install the speaker in a wooden box or not. In my opinion, it is better to install the power supply part of the AC radio in a separate wooden box, because it can also be used for other experiments.</p>
<p>(8) Power Transformer: It is best for amateurs to make their own power transformers or have them custom-made by a manufacturer. The secondary output, B+, is best wound to 500 volts, 1 amp, with a center tap for full-wave rectification. A+ should be wound with 1.5 volts, 3.5 amps, 5 volts, 2 amps, and 6.3 volts, 1.5 amps, three coils, all connected to the center line. As for the design methods for the number of turns of the coils, the gauge of the wire, and the cross-sectional area of the iron core, they are all recorded in various newspapers and magazines, so I won't repeat them here. The A+ transformer used in semi-AC models can be purchased as a doorbell transformer with a 6-volt secondary coil, but the doorbell transformer does not have a center line. You can remove it and rewind it, or connect a 50 to 75 ohm center resistor in parallel.</p>
<p>Having written this, I must make a final statement and solemnly advise the readers that nowadays, cheap and inferior goods flood the market. Those unscrupulous merchants have exhausted their conscience and are only interested in profit. We amateurs must not be insane and greedy for cheapness, lest we be ridiculed for having a five-minute craze. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e210">Skip Distance of Shortwave Communication (Continued) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Chong Ling</p>
<p>(2) Elevation Angle of Radio Waves: Radio waves are radiated upwards to the Heaviside layer and reflected back to the ground. However, not all radio waves with various elevation angles can be reflected back by the Heaviside layer. In fact, when the elevation angle of a certain wavelength exceeds a certain angle, it can directly penetrate the Heaviside layer and never return. Therefore, for each wavelength, under certain conditions of the Heaviside layer, there is only a maximum elevation angle. Beyond this angle, the radio waves are consumed outside the Heaviside layer and cannot be reflected back. This maximum elevation angle, except for those close to ninety degrees, reflects radio waves that are very far from the transmitting station, so the skip distance is inevitable. As shown in Figure 1, it is clear that the skip distance increases as the elevation angle decreases. The shorter the wavelength, the smaller the maximum elevation angle, so the skip distance also increases. According to Taylor's report on the maximum elevation angle: in the spring, for the Heaviside layer at 1000 miles, the elevation angle is 54 degrees for a 40-meter wavelength and 18 degrees for a 20-meter wavelength. In the winter night, for the Heaviside layer at 500 miles, it is 52 degrees for 40 meters, and 0 degrees for a 10-meter wavelength.</p>
<p>(3) Height of the Heaviside Layer: The height of the Heaviside layer rises and falls with the seasons and day and night. It has a slight impact on the elevation angle of radio waves and has a large relationship with changes in wavelength. It is higher in winter than in summer, and lower during the day than at night. It is lowest in late summer, about 50 to 100 miles, and highest in winter nights, 300 to 500 miles. Summer nights are 150 to 220 miles, and winter days are only 100 to 170 miles. As the height of the Heaviside layer increases, the skip distance also increases accordingly. This can be seen from Figure 2. (End)</p>

<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Hong Kong News: In the islands of the Dutch East Indies in the South Seas, there is an island named Ba Boss, where women are not allowed to leave the island. Even when going out for a daily stroll, they must cover their faces with a black cloth, leaving only their eyes to see. Now, a Westerner named Mr. Yunzhe has deposited more than 100,000 yuan with the island's government as a security deposit to obtain permission to take more than 20 famous dancers from the area to travel the world and perform. They are scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at the end of next month. It is also said that these more than 20 dancers are all virgins. When they return to the island in the future, they must undergo a physical examination by a doctor to see if there have been any changes, before the security deposit can be reclaimed. Otherwise, it will be confiscated. Therefore, the Westerner has specially hired an island woman and two Western women to closely monitor them day and night to prevent any mishaps that could lead to a complete loss.</p>
<p>The fate of the women of Ba Boss Island seems extremely unfortunate! Not being allowed to leave the island deprives them of the freedom of movement that people should have! Even when going out for a daily stroll, they must cover their faces with a black cloth, leaving only their eyes to see. This is simply not treating them as human beings!</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions after all. Now, the Westerner Mr. Yunzhe has taken out more than 100,000 yuan as a security deposit, and the government has made an exception and released more than 20 dancers to travel the world. Money can make gods work, and this is indeed not a false statement!</p>
<p>However, the island's government, which usually controls local women so strictly, still cannot feel at ease even though they have released these more than 20 dancers. Because these dancers are all virgins, the authorities, to protect the dignity of their virginity, came up with a clever method and signed a treaty with the Westerner, stipulating that when the dancers return to the island in the future, they must undergo a physical examination by a doctor to see if there have been any changes before the security deposit can be reclaimed, otherwise, it will be confiscated. This strategy is indeed foolproof. The Westerner, in order to protect his more than 100,000 yuan investment, specially hired an island woman and two Western women to closely monitor them day and night to prevent any mishaps. This is tantamount to the island's government entrusting him with the responsibility of controlling these more than 20 virgins.</p>
<p>But we really don't understand why the government of this Ba Boss Island restricts ordinary women so much? Why does it value virgins so much? Who is this for? Naturally, it is for the men! Otherwise, they wouldn't take such measures.</p>
<p>However, it is strange that virgins are precious, but money is even more precious! Although the authorities of Ba Boss Island value virgins very much, as long as there is money, virgins can also be sold! Otherwise, doesn't the phrase "otherwise, it will be confiscated" clearly state that if these dancers' bodies have changed after the examination, the more than 100,000 yuan security deposit will be confiscated, and that's the end of it?</p>
<h3 id="e213">Rain <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>I praise the rain. I can't forget all the scenes it has left in my memory, and I like to trace them with a kind of delicate emotion. Rain has the potential to change your mood and is even more suitable for the indulgence of a person who is accustomed to a solitary life. It can drive away all the vulgar disturbances outside your world and create a quiet realm beyond compare, making you forget everything that exists except yourself. But its diverse, beautiful patterns and profound meanings are not something everyone can appreciate. It is truly like an obscure poem that cannot be fully understood without careful eyes. Perhaps it is when a large dark cloud suddenly appears in the sky at dusk, and the sky gradually darkens. You think that the rain is probably coming, and as you are thinking this, the rain is already drizzling lightly. Then, it falls harder and harder, and in an instant, the ground, the roof tiles, and the leaves are all wet.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Wettened. You lean on the window and stare. Before long, the distant scenery that was just brightly reflected in your eyes is also shrouded in a heavy mist, blurred like a layer of smoke. Even the intertwined images of people coming and going in the street outside the window are equally submerged in the misty rain, and almost nothing can be seen because the windowpanes are covered with raindrops. Then, the sky completely darkens. Only the gradually dripping rain can be heard, becoming the only solo piece in the dusk. In this way, your mood will inevitably change very quickly. Just as the rain changes the outside world, if you were planning to go out before the rain, but the rain is already dripping endlessly, and the road is muddy, who would be happy to run out again? Change the time. Suddenly, you will dispel the idea of going out and sit down peacefully. Whether to go or not is not something you need to hesitate about. The rain is falling so steadily that it won't stop immediately. Usually, you can't avoid being indecisive, but at this moment, you absolutely don't need to worry about these things. You have only one thought: don't go. Even if there is something important, the person you are supposed to meet may have already guessed that you won't come, or they may have given up waiting and are deciding for you that you don't need to go. Rain will invisibly give you some peace and comfort. If you want to be quiet the most, this is the quietest time. Rain prevents people from visiting you, so you don't have to worry about unexpected disturbances. Just focus on thinking what you want to think and doing what you want to do.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, perhaps the continuous rain is even heavier. You sit alone by the bright lamp, surrounded by the silent, tombstone-like stillness. All that surrounds you is the dripping rain outside. You listen attentively to the eaves of rain dripping together and falling one after another. Lightly, heavily, one after the other, it sounds even crisper and more clanging, as if it penetrates from the depths of your heart, and even your soul seems to be immersed in it. You feel a strange sense of softness and a kind of pure beauty, like a clear lake with a visible bottom, and your body is like a dust-free swallow, inserting its wings and flying to the ideal country. You forget all the sorrows in your heart and the constraints of the coarse fabric of life. Rain can truly give you a selfless illusion and the liberation of spiritual shackles. And this gift is something anyone can seek. There is rain, rain is falling, and it is always and everywhere available. However, people who cannot bear the true beauty of rain are different. For them, rain becomes a hateful thing, especially if it keeps raining for days without end. There is no clean place except for the house. How can they not be annoyed, reducing the scope of daily life to just one house? People who are good at moving and wandering mostly curse the rain, because rain will ruthlessly extinguish all their interests outside. And it's no wonder that they can't have a connection with rain.</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Story of Mr. Nice Guy <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Tian</p>
<p>The dilapidated temple, surrounded by weeds on all sides, used to be a place of great incense and popularity. People from the town and nearby villages would come to draw a fortune stick on the first and fifteenth of each month because the fortune sticks here were extremely accurate, with about nine out of ten being correct. Therefore, the incense became more and more prosperous day by day.</p>
<p>But in just two years, this place had completely changed. Not only did no one from the nearby villages come to the temple, but not even a single person from the town came. The temple keeper understood the reason for this, but he always wondered why this sacred deity, who used to be so efficacious, was no longer worshipped? Even if the harvest was bad, and natural and man-made disasters had led to family ruin and death, they should still pray to the gods. What were these people thinking?</p>
<p>The temple keeper stubbornly guarded the temple for two years, hoping that it would flourish again. Even if it couldn't return to its former glory, at least someone should come to the temple! But the temple keeper's hope was shattered day by day, finally leading to his disappointment. He couldn't stay in this dilapidated temple, which hadn't been repaired for two years, and live with an empty stomach. He had no choice but to abandon this land of opportunity and go elsewhere to seek a livelihood.</p>
<p>The temple was already dilapidated, but after the temple keeper left, it became even more desolate. Weeds grew wildly on all sides, uneven and rampant. The sacred place, once bustling with incense, had become a desolate ruin.</p>
<p>For several months, no one had lived there. The weeds grew so tall that they covered the temple gate. Inside the temple, a foul odor permeated the air, and spiderwebs covered the deity's seat, making it airtight. The ash on the seat was already an inch thick.</p>
<p>This dilapidated temple was almost forgotten in people's minds. In this era, no one would come to the temple to burn incense anymore. However, this suited Mr. Nice Guy perfectly. He could move into this dilapidated temple without attracting attention. He had been living here for over a month now.</p>
<p>There was only one public elementary school and one private school in the town. The private school had closed its doors two years ago. The public school had managed to persevere, but it finally had to close this year. However, a notice was posted at the entrance, saying that it was temporarily suspending classes for one semester. But who would believe that? In such a depressed market, who would still study, and who could afford to donate money to the school? It would be fortunate enough if the shops didn't close!</p>
<p>Mr. Xu was an honest man who had been teaching in the town for over a decade. He wasn't a local. He had come here over a decade ago to work as a secretary in the district office. At that time, he was around forty years old. After working as a secretary in the district office for a few years, he was invited to teach in the public school. Because he was honest and older, no matter how the school's administrators changed, and the teachers were renewed every year, only he had never been moved. He continued to teach year after year. Everyone knew that he was the most knowledgeable person in the town, and the students he taught were all knowledgeable and reasonable.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu gradually became famous in the town. The students in the school liked him because he taught well and was honest. He had a naturally quiet personality, and he was very slow to do things. No one had ever seen him in a hurry. Now that he was older, he had become an even more mature, prudent, and peaceful Mr. Nice Guy. Almost everyone in the town knew that he was a Mr. Nice Guy.</p>
<p>However, things often don't go as planned. From two years ago until now, the town's economy had been deteriorating day by day. Not to mention that parents from the villages didn't send their children to school, even in the town, except for a few wealthier families, no one had money to send their children to school. Gradually, the school became deserted. This year, it had to close due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p>Once the school closed, Mr. Nice Guy had no way to make a living. At first, he could still live in the empty school, but recently it had been rented out to store goods. The issue of housing caused Mr. Nice Guy to panic.</p>
<p>After searching for several days, he finally found this dilapidated temple, which shared the same fate as the school.</p>
<p>From then on, he lived in this forgotten temple, but he was still thinking:</p>
<p>"As long as the harvest is better, and the school reopens, I will be a teacher again."</p>
<p>However, this hope ultimately wouldn't come to pass.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Night on the Banks of the Chao Phraya River <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>The sun slants to the west, floating on the scarlet Chao Phraya River, collecting its scorching flames, as big as a copper gong, the reddest like the yolk of a salted duck egg, quietly sinking into the rippling water.</p>
<p>At this time, the azure blue sky is covered with shimmering evening clouds, reflecting thousands of golden waves on the Chao Phraya River, like an endless serpent, gently rippling. The beautiful and serene scenery of the southern country evening is so beautiful and pleasing!</p>
<p>On both banks of the Chao Phraya River, the "Ti Tou" (a "Ti Tou" is slightly smaller than a pier, serving the same purpose, and is made of teak wood) is gradually becoming more crowded with people - some foreign vagrants adrift! They have finished their hard and heavy work from the day, eaten dinner, and are whistling a seductive southern tune, carefree, carrying iron buckets bare-chested on the riverbank to enjoy the cool air. Naturally, the topic of their conversations at this time is those flirtatious and beautiful "foreign" girls with their bare upper bodies, exposing two sharp, towering breasts like newly built graves.</p>
<p>"Bingxing, after we cool off, let's go to Triangle Street together for an iced coffee," the young man Yu Agou, bending over, scoops a bucket of water from the river and pours it over his head in a flurry, turning his head to Bingxing, who is whistling so cheerfully. "Then let's go to 'Sky Beyond the Sky' to listen to the opera. A new female Dan (female role) has arrived. Her dark, sparkling eyes glance down the stage, quite pretty! I'll be the host, will you go?..."</p>
<p>The young fellow called Bingxing didn't respond, just kept scooping water from the river with his iron bucket, pouring it over his head in a torrent, whistling a passionate and unrestrained tune.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Are you going to 'Sky Beyond the Sky' to listen to the opera?... Or is that 'foreign' girl behind the hostel making you crazy!" Yu Agou hits his arm, pretending to be very angry.</p>
<p>"Humph, humph... Agou, I'm really sorry! I have something to do tonight."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Bingxing is the kind of guy who loves to hang out with "foreign girls" and go to the opera house. Usually, as soon as the sun sinks into the Chao Phraya River, his soul is taken by them. Why is it that tonight, when he is invited to go out, he insists he has something to do? This makes Yu Agou feel a little uncomfortable! However, he is too embarrassed to force him again. So, he examines Bingxing's face for a while and laughs nasally!</p>
<p>"Humph,... you rascal, go on your way! I know you have a date with that 'foreign' girl tonight. I know! Humph... Agou makes a face at him for a while, then, carrying the iron bucket, leaves the "Ti Tou" with a thud.</p>
<p>Bingxing dries the dampness from his body, puts on his clothes, and strolls leisurely along the riverbank until he reaches the "Royal Ti Tou," where he stops and stares blankly at the heart of the river, lost in thought. "She should be coming about now," Bingxing thinks, lowering his head.</p>
<p>"Bingxing, you must have been waiting anxiously, right? I'm really sorry!" The girl's voice is soft, gentle, like a singing nightingale.</p>
<p>Instantly, Bingxing's heart is happy, his face like a spring rose. At this moment, his heart blossoms!</p>
<p>"Lina, why are you so late? The moon has already crept up to the treetops of the coconut grove!"</p>
<p>They sit closely shoulder to shoulder on the "Ti Tou," looking at the quiet river water like silk, whispering intimately.</p>
<p>Apart from their tender, soft conversation, sharp laughter, and the crisp, clear sounds of fish leaping out of the calm water and then falling back in from time to time, everything lies silently under the moonlight. The night on the banks of the Chao Phraya River is so poetic, cool, and serene!</p>
<h3 id="e216">Before and After Returning Home <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Chong Lin</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>On the first night on the "Da Da Niang" ship, I lay wearily in the cabin, silently exhaling a few long breaths. Good, all the chaos before departure had ended, and both I and my luggage had been safely moved onto the ship. If our ship didn't catch fire in the ocean like the "George Philip," then we could patiently wait to see our Shanghai.</p>
<p>But a new uneasiness, anxiety, and worry arose in my mind. The China of my long-held dreams, I was about to see it. Could this be real? It was real. I couldn't help but laugh, but my laughter immediately brought sorrow. So the matter of returning home became something that seemed necessary but unwelcome.</p>
<p>The night before arriving in Singapore, I was enjoying the cool air on deck. A grassy scent—the scent of oriental grass—drifted from the islands on both sides, suddenly like a shot of anesthetic into my brain, stirring deep homesickness in me.</p>
<p>On the Singapore pier, I saw a fashionable Chinese Miss—or Madam—who had come to see someone off. Her clothes were in a style I hadn't imagined for years: a long silk dress, with slits up to her thighs, short sleeves, a high, stiff collar, and her hair was permed, with high heels. But as I looked at her closely, seeing her clenched arms and stooped, unstraight back, I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable and uneasy for her. I couldn't help but want to say to her:</p>
<p>"Straighten your back, why are you clenching your arms? Be more natural! Be more energetic!"</p>
<p>A Mr. Wang, who was studying sculpture on the same ship, was unlike the usual Chinese artist, had some practical thoughts, and his criticism of things was sometimes very close to ours. He began to sigh with emotion</p>
<p>"Chinese people just love that kind of affectation. I'm used to seeing naked human bodies, but I don't find it obscene. The way Chinese women dress now, with their long dresses slit up to their thighs, is really obscene."</p>
<p>"Really, if you want to expose your thighs to the sun, then you might as well make the dress shorter." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e217">Is "Coal" a Plant? <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>Recently, in your column, I saw your description of "The Production and Uses of Petroleum," which was concise and to the point, providing us shop assistants with no scientific knowledge with a lot of academic help. I am truly grateful.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>Due to "Petroleum," I am writing to ask you about a problem that has been hidden in my mind for a long time. I think that since you are willing to explain petroleum in such detail, you probably won't refuse my question, right?</p>
<p>There is something that is widely used, and it is an indispensable thing in industry, that is, "coal," which everyone knows. We can be said to see "coal" every day, black things one by one, which are not unusual at all. However, if you use a scholar's attitude to investigate, it makes me unable to answer my question. For example: is coal like a plant, growing out of the ground? What is it made of? Or is there another reason? Therefore, I have asked others, but others cannot clearly answer these questions. Finally, I have no choice but to trouble you. I think you will definitely give me some guidance.</p>
<p>Also: are "stone coal" and "coal" two different things? Yours respectfully, Yang Kaisheng</p>
<p>Editor's Note: "Coal" is indeed a very common substance, and there must be many people who know how it is produced, which is not surprising. But based on the general level of knowledge of the public, we believe that there must be many people whose understanding of "coal" is very vague. Therefore, we will briefly describe it as follows.</p>
<p>"Coal" is the common name for "stone coal." Speaking of the causes of these coals, it was a matter of ancient times. In very ancient times, the temperature inside the earth was much higher than it is now, and the seawater at that time was heated by the high temperature. This hot sea increased the temperature in the air, and dew and water vapor filled the atmosphere; at the same time, the carbon dioxide contained in the atmosphere was also more than it is now, so it could make plants flourish. People now call that era the Carboniferous Period, the era when ferns flourished. The speed at which plants grew at that time was beyond our imagination. It is said that the seeds of plants fell on the ground and sprouted immediately. Before long, they grew into large trees, and then the large trees fell and died. Young plants continued to flourish one after another. After the ground was covered with the remains and seeds of the fallen plants, the plants that grew each died and were piled on top of them again. These plant remains gradually overlapped, reaching hundreds or thousands of feet in thickness: after this thick layer of plant remains mostly sank to the bottom of the sea, mud and sand pressed on it, gradually accumulating, also reaching thousands of feet in thickness. After tens of thousands of years, the plant remains buried deep in the ground gradually changed. The "hydrogen" and "oxygen" in the plant components gradually disappeared, (leaving behind) carbonaceous matter, which became today's coal.</p>
<p>Coal has anthracite, bituminous coal, lignite, and peat. Anthracite is the highest-grade coal, which does not produce coal smoke when burned. The chemical changes of this coal have mostly ended, and it is almost entirely carbon coal. The following order of bituminous coal, lignite, and peat is gradually lower, especially peat. Because the chemical changes of peat have not yet been completed, it contains a lot of "hydrogen" and "oxygen", and it does not burn much when burned? It also produces a lot of smoke.</p>
<p>Also, that coal tar made from coal through dry distillation can be used to make various dyes and medicines and is also an important material in industry. Due to space limitations, let's talk about it next time if we have the opportunity.</p>

<p>Beautiful flowers and bright moon in the heart of heaven. An outstanding beauty is beyond the dust. To know the three treasures of the world. Beautiful flowers, bright moon, and a beauty. The flower is beautiful. The moon is bright. There is no beauty in ancient or modern times. All have the body of a flower. The spirit of the moon. Loving the moon and staying up late. Cherishing the flower and feeling the remnant spring. Beauty is the soul of the moon. The flower is the soul. Moon and flower are one. However, a good flower needs green leaves. The bright moon hates woven clouds. People want clothes and Buddha wants gold. Some say Lady Guo Guo received the emperor's grace. Riding into the palace gate in the morning. But嫌脂粉無顏色。 Lightly sweeping the eyebrows towards the supreme one. Do you know how many Ladies Guo Guo there have been in ancient and modern times. Princess Shouyang's plum blossom makeup on the forehead. The self-proclaimed palace maidens painted cinnabar lips. Chu Bao fine glue still makes a score. Tang Palace eyebrow patterns are new in paintings. Stars shimmer when the Luan mirror opens in the morning and evening. Want to change the tray杉兰麝薰. When idle, call the maid to grind snail ink. Powder white and rouge evenly on the face. Always want to feel the good daughter's nature from head to toe. Touching the head will be satisfactory. It is often said that a precious sword is given to a hero. Red powder is given to a beauty. Put rouge and emerald blue on the dressing table as treasures. A fifteen-year-old delicate maiden comes out gracefully. Walking slowly in front of the clogs in the corridor. Like a fairy descending to the dust. Wuling killed Zhao Shisun.</p>

<p>Qi, Zheng, and Wei Fight at Lang (Continued)</p>
<p>Alas, if a small country has merit and can step on top of a large country, then a minister has merit and can override his ruler, and a son has merit and can be proud of his father. I once saw Zheng Hu at the beginning when he defeated the Rong army, imprisoned the two commanders, displayed the captives, and presented them to Qi in triumph, his spirit swallowing the feudal lords, looking down on the nobility. At the time of the gift, he was temporarily taken by someone first, and when he mobilized the armies of the three countries to attack him, how magnificent it was. When he succeeded to the throne, he was weak and did not flourish. His exile, his return, repudiating his name and going to the feudal lords, and even slandering him as a cunning child, they did not treat him as a ruler at the meeting. Suffering such humiliation, where was the magnificence of the past? The reason is that Hu's personality is that when he is successful, his spirit is full, and he regards himself as not being able to bear its greatness. People slightly despise him, and he cannot calm down. When he is frustrated, his spirit dries up, and he regards himself as not being able to bear its smallness. People greatly despise him, but he cannot compare. In it, there is no master at the beginning, only looking at external objects as light or heavy, filling with things, drying up with things, becoming big with things, becoming small with things. Sometimes arrogant and sometimes discouraged, sometimes brave and sometimes timid, he cannot even know himself. If he cannot control himself, how can he master the country?</p>

<h3 id="e223">Literary Works are Sprouting Up, and Dickens Has Become a Cash Cow <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Heng</p>
<p>When film merchants find that glamorous, sensual song and dance films with big legs and frightening war beast films are no longer popular with audiences, their business eyes turn to literary works. Their business sense is indeed good, and they are indeed shifting their strategy based on "economics." Isn't it so? Filming literary works naturally ensures reliable sales, because the content of the subject matter is already familiar to everyone. With such an advertising foundation, filming will naturally create a sensation. Of course, film producers also have their captivating rhetoric, which is to enhance the audience's literary interest and appreciation of literary works.</p>
<p>There have been many literary works adapted for the screen, and everyone knows the names, so I won't list them again. What I want to describe now is Mr. Dickens. I think this gentleman can be considered the most valuable cash cow for film merchants today. Because his novels have been popular for decades, and the scope of readers is the widest. Based on this reason, they immediately concluded and echoed in unison, "It will definitely make money."</p>
<p>You see, his works that have been filmed and seen by people in Shanghai include "Oliver Twist," starring American child star Dickie Moore, "Great Expectations," produced by Universal Company and starring Phillip Holmes, and "A Tale of Two Cities," which is currently being screened. The Universal Company is currently filming the mysterious "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." This film stars Claude Rains, and most of the actors are British. Dickens's novel is full of suspense. According to Universal personnel, the success of this film in the future will definitely be a hit, because this film is Universal's greatest horror film since Lon Chaney's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."</p>
<p>"The Old Curiosity Shop" is being filmed in the British Hollywood—Elstree. The director of this film is the famous British Dickens expert Thomas Bentley. He once specialized in playing characters from Dickens's books on the British stage and won praise.</p>
<p>Two works are being prepared for filming: "A Tale of Two Cities" and "The Pickwick Papers." American and British companies are discussing filming these two novels. According to recent news, Warner Bros. has decided to film "The Pickwick Papers" with the great character actor Guy Kibbee playing Mr. Pickwick. Britain has also decided to produce this film. It may be on the market earlier than the American film. Let's wait and see which one is better.</p>
<p>This year can be said to be "Dickens Year" in the British and American film circles. However, when literary films are once again disliked by audiences, where will the film merchants' business eyes turn?</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e224">Review of "Rainbow Rhythm" <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Aunty Sally - Guang Lu Screening</p>
<p>The comedy song and dance film "Rainbow Rhythm" is just like its theme song "Spring Clouds and Rainbows," something like clouds, haze, rainbows, just illusory, fictional, and unreasonable coincidences.</p>
<p>In order to point out these shortcomings, I must first briefly describe its plot: Kelly, the king of a New York nightclub, ran to London to open a large-scale nightclub in order to escape the harassment of local gangsters. He used the song and dance program "Spring Clouds and Rainbows" as a gimmick for the opening ceremony. When hundreds of girls applied for training, Sally, who claimed to have performance talent, suddenly came and pestered him to join the performance in a seemingly crazy manner. After being rejected several times, she threw herself into Kelly's home and worked as a maid. Although he gradually changed from disliking her to liking her, he never agreed to her request to dedicate herself to song and dance.</p>
<p>Sally disguised herself as Sasha, a famous French singer, to see Kelly, and was indeed hired as the protagonist. During the makeup session before the performance, she was kidnapped by the previous gangsters. The play became tense in terms of the gangsters and Kelly bargaining, and Sally's attempts to escape from the bandit's den. As a result, she escaped back and rushed to perform the protagonist's play, and killed the bandit who murdered Kelly during the performance, and was "gratefully" married by him as his wife. Naturally, good is rewarded with good, and evil people such as gangsters will of course get their due evil results and fall into the clutches of the law.</p>
<p>Not only is the ending of good and evil being rewarded, and the happy ending is mediocre and ordinary, but the entire fictional story is so unreasonable! In fact, one who can win the title of king of nightclubs like Kelly should normally be a tycoon among gangsters, but here he is a cowardly weakling, and he can actually keep himself clean—as in the play, he is unwilling to associate with gangsters—this is unreasonable one. Kelly didn't recognize Sally, the maid who seemed crazy, repeatedly bothered him, and saw each other day and night, because she put on makeup. Instead, he regarded her as a real famous French singer Sasha, and gave her the position of protagonist, this is unreasonable two. Similarly, the person who played Sally's supporting role in the so-called "tumbling dance" was temporarily disguised by bandits and took the stage, and was able to perform the tumbling so well as shown in the play without being recognized by Kelly or the people in charge backstage, this is unreasonable three. As for the coincidences such as Sally escaping from the underground house, and a machine bicycle being driven back, and the costumed supporting actor happened to be knocked unconscious by the bandits at the door and stole his clothes to disguise himself, there are too many to enumerate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fact that London and New York are equally rampant with gangsters, and that kidnapping and assassinations can occur in public, is an exposure: and the satire that today is a maid, and tomorrow she can pretend to be a star, and actually achieve fame and success, is quite revealed.</p>
<p>Lim Whelan has worked extremely hard in directing this script written by Xian himself. Not only did he use many choreographic song and dance scenes, such as clouds and rainbows, to make the audience temporarily forget the dissatisfaction with reality, and Kelly's bargaining under the gangsters' guns, and the tense atmosphere of the song and dance performance and Sally's escape, the editing was extremely successful.</p>
<p>However, Xi Xuelei, known as the female Chaplin, has a kind of pretentious acting that makes people unable to compliment her. Of course, she also performed the two personalities after pretending to be Sally and the energy of a famous singer.</p>
<p>A scene from "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain": "The First Love of the Child; The Lover of the Mother!" Performed by Lu Jier Herson and Warren William - Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>"Rainbow Rhythm" is the latest song and dance blockbuster from the British Gaodui Company. Starring the female Chaplin, Xi Xuelei Zhedena, the whole film is full of humorous and funny atmosphere. Today, it will be screened at Guangyi Cinema.</p>
<p>Xi Rendailisi can perform Chinese drama and is known as the foreign Mei Lanfang. She will meet the people of Shanghai soon.</p>

<p>— Tong Yun</p>
<p>Jordan's attitude when speaking was very stern. He continued, "I have warned you several times before, especially about your attitude towards my friends. But this time you have gone too far." Sharon, hearing Jordan reprimanding Jim Brown, raised her head unconsciously, with a very triumphant look on her face. She said to Jordan, "Goodbye. I'm leaving. My mother is still waiting for me at the Sunter Seaside Club." She said triumphantly and walked out, ignoring Jim.</p>
<p>After Sharon left, Jim said to Jordan, "Look, don't worry. I'll just resign." He said and walked out. When Barr and Gabe heard that Jim Brown had resigned, they also wanted to resign together, but Jim told them, "You have to stay here, you can't leave. None of you can leave. When I find the news, you can write it down right away." After he finished speaking, he left the newspaper office.</p>
<p>Jim left the newspaper office and ran straight to the Sunter Seaside Club to find Sharon. When he found her, his attitude was very humble. He said that he knew he had done something wrong and had now been dismissed from his job, and would soon be returning to Kansas City. "But the first thing I want to do," he said, "is to apologize to Tom Penisteder. But he won't talk to me on the phone. So I have to ask you. You just need to say one word, and he will be willing to see me."</p>
<p>Sharon believed his words and agreed. When they got into the car and headed towards Penisteder's house, Sharon was no longer as arrogant as before. She originally had a revengeful heart, wanting to watch Jim Brown reap his own reward. But now that Jim was about to leave New York and go to Kansas, she suddenly felt an inexplicable discomfort. She had forgotten how he had used everything about her. She felt a pang of pity for him, although in fact, he didn't seem to have any love for her.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Penisteder's door, Sharon felt a pang of discomfort in her heart that she could hardly bear. But Jim walked into Penisteder's house and didn't apologize to Penisteder either. He wandered around looking around. Sharon also forgave him, knowing that admitting guilt to others was a very embarrassing thing, so he was slow to open his mouth. At this time, Penisteder suddenly asked, "Sharon, I'm not being rude, but I want to know what Mr. Brown is here for?"</p>
<p>Sharon glanced at Jim and murmured. "Um... Ah... The truth is like this..." Brown glared at her, as if telling her not to speak. So he said himself: "I came to your house because I wanted to tell you that I was too much, I heard the rumors outside, and I believed it was true. It's just that someone said that Zhuliya Boderson had paid 200,000 yuan in bank loans for you, but I believed it. He pretended to tap his head with his finger and said: "I am really foolish."</p>
<p>Penisteder smiled slightly. Sharon's heart gradually became suspicious, feeling that Jim's words didn't sound like an apology, and his attitude was no longer as humble as before. But Jim continued to ramble: "I also thought... maybe last night, you rocked Zhulia Boderson to her house. Don't you have a small boat? But this is all your fault, let me guess wildly like this. Why didn't you tell me where you were last night?" (To be continued)</p>
