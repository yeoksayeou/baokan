<p>時評</p>
<h3>中日事件與意阿事件  端</h3>
<p>近數年來國聯所處理之國際間之爭議事件。較可注意者有四。如（一）東三省事件。（二）大廈谷事件。（三）德之軍備平等事件。（四）之意阿事件國聯處理東三省事件。不可謂不盡力。然中國所得之結果。不過「一葉秋海棠」之形態在「地圖上」保持其完整而已。大廈谷事件。以雙方皆爲小國。勢均力敵。國聯之處置似尙覺順手。德之軍備平等問題。卽感棘手矣。德似出柙之虎。逆之恐攖其怒。從之無以自解。依違莫可。卒不能廻德國之駕。任其絕裾以去。今之意阿事件。與中日事件最爲相似。國聯對中日事件。固已以不了了之。意之於阿。雖同是一强一弱。但阿之後尙有强有力之援助。非中國可比。國聯其亦能以不了了之乎。</p>
<p>英國晨郵報記意相墨索里尼之言曰。「戰事將否發生。此其權不在意國。而在阿比西尼亞與國聯。」其意若曰。國聯如承認以阿比西尼亞全部爲总殖民地。而阿對意又不取反抗態度。則意可以不戰。然阿今日所以備戰者。亦以大軍壓境。與其不戰而亡母寧戰而亡。正所謂寧玉碎無瓦全之用意也。况戰則猶有倖存之望乎。</p>
<p>至於國聯。爲意阿爭端。可謂已盡委曲求全之能事矣。國聯所組織之五人特委會。已草有解决方案。根據八月間巴黎一國會議英法之提案。擬修正阿國與意國殖民地邊界。改組阿國警　。與由阿國聘有技術顧問。而仍尊重阿皇之主權。理事會內部對於此案雖已重行作議刪改。但大體上當不致有何變動。在先盛傳解决辦法。亦謂意之於阿。將如英之於伊拉克。否則或將阿之經濟利權讓於意。然而阿皇有言。如有侵犯其主權領土之完整者。必抵抗到底。此次國聯所擬之辦法。非侵犯阿之主權領十乎。阿之抵抗到底若不徒托空言。當不遽肯忍受此等條件。意則旣費去二十萬萬利拉。欲得此資源學富之士地。如不饜其慾。勢亦不能甘休。設兩國不幸而以兵戎相見。列强將仍如對於中日事件。取旁觀態度乎。抑積極出而干涉乎。此則當視阿國今後如何應付其國難矣。</p>

<h3>本市禁烟問題　汪大燧代蔡勁軍播音演講</h3>
<p>中央社云、本市敎育局、於昨日下午五時、邀請安局長蔡勁軍、假座中西廣橎電臺、演講本市禁烟問題、蔡氏臨時因公未能抽身、特派該局督察長在大燧代表播音演講如下、</p>
<p>追源禍始今天奉上海市公安局蔡局長之命、來講禁烟問題、蔡局長上月對於這問題、已經講過　次、今天再出鄙人補充　下、在沒有說到禁烟問題之先、我們首先要明白鴉片烟的來源、原來雅片烟是印度的出產、在前淸咸　之間　才運輸到中國來、當時全國的人民、不知這鴉片的害處、都把牠當消遺品來看待、認知道在這種狀况之下、造成了我　們許許多多的同胞們、解除不了的毒害、到了道光年間、烟不經意的流傳、便遍佈了全國、而鴉片煙的輸入、也一天一天的增加了、統計起來、當時輸入的鴉片、有三萬餘箱、値銀二千餘萬兩、然而在這烟毒流遍全國的時候、稍有眼光的人、都知道吸烟的禍害、到了道光十九年間、林則徐奉令到廣東、舉辦禁烟、緝捕烟商、沒收財產、因爲操之過激、所以功敗竽成、反引起了鴉片戰禍、自此以後、鴉片毒品的輸入、遂一年　年的增加了、流出的金錢、不可計數、利權的喪失、與國民經濟所受到的影響，非筆墨可以形容了、</p>
<p>流毒國內</p>
<p>同顧我國過去烟毒的狀况、凡到過四川·雲南·貴州·的人們、都知道這幾省的農田、旣十分之六七、栽種鴉片了、其他各省、在過去也有同樣的情形、不過沒有那麼厲害吧了、因此鴉片的產額多、米穀的產量少、同時閙饑荒的事實、也迭見了、我們知道、糧食的缺乏、烟民的增加、爲造成社會不安必然的現象、照這樣推斷下去、如果不從速禁烟的話、簡直把國家的命運、一天一天走向滅亡的道上去了、</p>
<p>烟犯日增</p>
<p>再從事實方面視察、從本市公安局查獲烟犯的統計、來作　個比較吧、二十一年緝獲　烟犯三千五百名、二十　年緝獲的烟犯、增至六千二百七十六名、一十二年緝獲的烟犯、又增加至六千九百五十六名、照這樣看起來、吸　鴉片的人犯、是一年多似一年了、消費者天的增加加、生產者一天一天的减少、同時這許多的同胞們、在吞雲吐霧醉生夢死裏過生活、自然要影響到全民族的健康、造成了經濟落後的社會狀態了、總而言之、在這百餘年來、舉凡國權的喪失·經濟的落後·民生的凋弊·農村的破產·一切的一切、莫不是爲了鴉片、也就是因爲鴉片毒物、造成了整個國家民族支離破碎的局面、</p>
<p>决心禁絕</p>
<p>銷有思想的人、都知道鴉片烟的流毒、足以亡我國家、滅我種族、自從林即徐實行禁烟失敗之後、不論淸廷也吧·北洋軍閥也吧繼續在舉辦禁烟、可是爲什麼禁烟禁烟、直到現在、還不能禁掉呢、細察其所以不能禁絕的原因有二、（一）政的對於禁烟、沒有澈底禁絕的决心，（二）政府對於禁烟、沒有切實的辦法、因爲過去的禁烟祗有吸合鴉片治罪的條文、沒有剷除烟苗分期禁種禁吸的根本辦法、所以鴉片的出產年年增加、吸烟人民也年年加多了、現在我們蔣季昌長、對於禁烟下最大决心、從根本着手、採用曩年國民會議議决的六年禁絕鴉片方案、决定自本年始、至二十九年止、爲禁絕期間、除嚴訂章程、分期禁種以外、關於禁止吸食鴉片、採用兩個最有效方法、就是一方面　倡新生活運動、來轉移社會風氣、鼓勵民衆·協助政府禁烟、一方面用科學的方法、在極和平與極有系統的原則之下、使烟民分期戒除烟癮、本市秉承政府禁惆的計劃、已經於七月底開始登記了、從七月起至九月底止、爲自動登記期、在這個期間內、准許人民自動投戒或領照、十月起至十月底止、爲强迫登記期、在這個期間內就開始拘捕私吸人犯、依法判處罰金、以後冉行勒令登記、</p>
<p>禁烟步驟</p>
<p>現在再將本市禁絕鴉片的步驟、給大家個報吿吧本　禁絕鴉片期限、遵照政府的計劃、定為六年、自本年起至　十九年止、六年分期禁絕、其步驟如次、（一）　十四年七月至十二月、辦理烟民登記、發給限期戒惆執照、（二）二十五年限期戒烟勃照、停止發給、所有已經登記的烟民、最少要有總數五分之　的戒絕、尙未戒絕的、換領新照、（三）二十六年已經登記領照的烟民、最少要有五分之二的戒絕、其尙未戒絕的、換領新照、（四）二十七年、已登記領照的烟民、最少要有五分之二的戒絕、其尙未戒絕的、換領新照、（五）二十八年已經登記領照的烟民、最少要有五分之四的戒絕、其尙未戒絕的、換領新照、（六）十九年、已經登記領照的煙民、應一律戒絕、戒惆執照繳銷、</p>
<p>登記手續</p>
<p>至於登記的手續、有請領普通戒烟執照的、應先塡具登記聲請書紙、本局即根據塡發執照、領貧民執照者、除塡聲請書以外、另外再呈保證書一紙、經本局派員調查以後、再發給貧民執照、請求戒烟的、也須照章塡具聲請書、保證書、經調查明白後、當即送往戒烟醫院、免費施戒、本局爲顧慮烟民覓保困難起見、所以規定保證人之資格、凡係烟民親友、有確實住址、正當職業的、都可充當、不定去尋覓舖保、領貧民戒烟執照的保證人、祗要保證烟民、並不冒充貧民、請求戒烟的保證人、祗要保證烟民於戒絕釋放後、將來本局定期傳送調騐時、烟民不故意逃避、並無共他的責任、所以充當烟民的保澄人、也不必多所顧忌了、</p>
<p>發給執照</p>
<p>在登記的時間、本局官警、全體爲烟民服役、烟民無論投赴本　、或本局所屬各分局、各警察所、各分駐所、隨處可以聲請登記、烟民凡有詢問、都詳細細的解答、理在規定本月份爲第一次發給戒烟執照的日期、各項手續、統已籌備完竣、即日就塡發執照、交警士按戶送達、總之、本局辦理登記的手續、務求簡便、種種辦法、統　烟民利益上着想、烟民請求登記領照、儘可勇往直前、不必多所懷疑了、</p>
<p>設院戒烟</p>
<p>至於本市辦理戒烟、經衛生局之努力籌備、現在先後成立的、計有滬北戒烟醫院、滬南戒烟醫院、人犯戒烟醫院、等　處、其中設備周全、待遇優厚、烟民戒烟、完全免費、戒絕日期、少則　餘日、多的五六十日、必至戒絕以後、方准出院、近來常有在其他各省市領照的烟民、慕名前夾本市、請求戒烟、本局亦准予送戒、至本市烟民、居住特區的、祗要登記手續完備、亦律送戒、但是現在登記期限有限、烟民有志戒烟的、不能再行遲妙了、</p>
<p>挨戶勸導</p>
<p>上海市公安局、自奉命辦理烟民登記以來、本局蔡局長、認此事關係民族復興前途重要、　决心、　澈底、確實奉行、曾於上月播音講明原委了、但登記可確定禁烟之前途、現下登記已經過一月又半的期限了、查出烟民、計一萬零十四人、其中已經登記的約二千人、所有未登記的烟民、本局已挨戶個別勸導、勸令自動前來登記、本局在此自動期內、無處不以寬大爲懷、以烟民利益爲前提、但是經本局調查的結果、烟民之中、仍有誤解法令、自甘舉棄的、經本局查出的烟民、有一部份不敢自動登記的、另有一部份不情願登記的、在烟民因循遷延、認爲已經苟安一時、但是無疑的、將來一　自蹈法網、後悔也來不及了、因爲禁烟計劃、全國一致、此次六個朋登記期限屆滿、全國停止登記、自從　　五年起、本局查獲烟犯、一律停發戒烟執照、於依法懲處以後、再行解送勸戒、本市如此、其他各省亦如此、吸食鴉片的人、假使不趁此機會、照章登記、將來就是走遍全國、也無安身之處了、</p>
<p>應速覺悟</p>
<p>吸食鴉片的人們、你們應知道鴉片爲害於個人民族國家的關係至大、如果不澈底戒除、不獨個人永久在　連困苦中過生活、把一生事業犧牲完了、就是國家民族、也直接間接的蒙受其害、更應知道戒烟能提高自己的地位、可以不受人們的輕視、可以恢復你們身體的健康、可以節省經濟、可以造福家庭、可以引你到光明幸福之路、　惆癮過深、不能馬上戒絕的人們、更應知道「登記」是政府「苦心孤詣」訂出來的仁至義的辦法、要切實遵行、不然、便會得到最厲害的懲處了、</p>
<p>改悔無及</p>
<p>現在自動登記的日期、快要完了、九月最後的天、便到强迫時期的開始了、也就是政府以法律的手段、來强制登記的時期到了、在此期內、本局就開始拘捕烟民、關於緝捕工作的淮行、本局當然與特區警務機關、取一致行動、萬其是在水陸交通口岸、嚴厲檢查行旅、吸食鴉片的人們、形態容貌、一望而知、即使不肯自認吸烟、一經調騐、就無從隱諱、决無法避免的、市民們、你們要根本認識淸禁、登記是千載難逢的機會、登記是向上、不登記是甘趨下流、登記是守法、不登記是自投法網、不吸烟的人們應一致恊助政府、勸導烟民、趕快登記、吸食鴉片的人們、應趕快到公安局去自動登記、尤其是房東一房東們、要勸導該戶內烟民、自動登記鄙人這次講的意義、就是希望全市民衆、要了解政府厲行禁烟、轉移社會風氣的苦衷、認識禁烟目前的嚴重性、一致起來協助政府、椎行禁政、復興中華民族、完了、書、業已抄送各會員、（二）工作方面、比較重要者、如招待前次來華之美國經濟考察團、雖非單獨之事、然本會實居發起人地位、招待處各項案卷、以及與美方交換意見紀錄、俱有本會保管會員中如需參考、可逕向本會索閱、此外聘請國外名譽代表、計有二十七人、分佈各國、此後各種貿易消息、均可直接互通聲氣、（三）出版方面、現有「一週間國際貿易消息」、按期分送各會員、雖材料有限、然一切皆得諸可靠方面、（四）上年度新會員團體及個人均有增加、</p>
<p>改選理事</p>
<p>最後卽改選理事、由各會員投票結果、張公權·陳光甫·郭秉文·林康侯·李馥蓀·貝淞蓀·徐新六·周作民·盧作孚·陳蔗靑。吳健陶·唐寳書·李法端·繆雲台·陳篳霖·曾養甫·黃江泉·等十七人票數最多當選爲本屆理事、次多數爲王延松·潘光迥</p>

<p>申報國貨周刊貢獻話歌頌新近之兩大發明  仰葊　　新近吾國貨界最值得欣幸的，無過於目前之兩大發明。一是木炭汽車，一是植物油燈，利用本國固有之材料，自給自足，無待外求，可算在中國發明史上，得到最有價値的地位，不僅舉國之光，且屬全民之幸。吾常常抱着一種杞憂心理，以爲世界戰爭，遲早必須爆發，意阿開其端，一旦牽動全局我東亞安能幸免。到那時候，汽油煤油，來源頓斷，試問全國數十萬輛之汽車，何從發動？舉國農村之媒油燈，更何從取光？一般享用的，還在如醉如痴瞢然不覺之中，但是有識的人，早已料到這點，不惜犧牲精血，以發明這種利國利民的兩大貢獻，這眞是値得我們歌頌的。　　木炭汽車，以向次濤君之中華煤氣車廠，湯仲明之仲明工廠爲最著。中間不知經過若干次之改進，二十餘種之式樣，纔能適合於社會之應用。向君等還認爲不滿足，天天在不斷研究之中。苟能完全優勝，推行無阻，則每年一千二百萬加倫之汽油，可以悉數挽回。而使用汽車者，年可减省百分之七十七的消費，有功於社會國家，豈在少數，這是値得歌頌之一。　　植物油燈爲鍾靈君三四年來研究上之結晶，鍾君鑒於煤油一物，幾占入口貨五分之一，他的消耗，可說都用在燃點燈火方而，萬一來源吿竭，內地必成黑暗世界，鍾君便發明許多壓力油燈，迪出煤油燈之上，一是價廉，二是省油，三是安全，四是衛生，五是光亮，凡我國的豆油花生油棉子油桐油蔴油等均可用作燃料，一經推銷，不惟可以杜塞每年一萬餘萬元之煤油進口，同時國內農村卽可增加製油的農產物一萬餘萬元，影響於國計民生，又豈少數，這又是値得歌頌之一。　　歌頌發明家，發明家是復興民族的寳貝，是中國起死回生的良醫。此而不歌頌，歌頌者誰？「九一八」紀念與國貨  張孟昭　　關外同胞，有「不堪回首故國秋風中」的感慨！韶華催人！「九一八」國難，已很快的滿四週年了！環顧世界大勢，再不容我們有優閒的餘地，　　從今天起，愛用國貨的，應永遠愛用，始終不渝！用舶來品的，應改過轉來，誓不再蹈覆轍！和决心戒烟一樣，大家母忘「九一八」卽應服用國貨，愛護，提倡，勸導，作爲日日應盡的天職，我相信要湔除「九一八」的國難，惟有人人心頭築起海關壁壘，杜寨漏巵！實現無形的經濟戰！人人翻開海關貿易册來，祇見國貨出超，外貨絕跡，到那功德圓滿時纔可以慶祝一番了！獎勵國貨發明人  汪瘦秋　　「外國貸是好的。」有很多的中國人，都抱着這種思想。當然，我們不敢說外國貨不好，因爲有很多的外國貨，它的質料；製造等項，都比我們中國貨來得精美，不過由我們國家的現狀看起來，我們運沒有資格享用這種精美的出品，因爲我們現在正是刻苦自勵的時代，誠如中委吳稚暉先生所言，必須省吃儉用，粗衣粗食，來度過這個經濟的難關，然後才能慢慢的走到錦衣玉食的那一條路上去。　　不過我們一方面應該刻苦自勵；一方面就要從工商業上去求發展。我們知道：發展工商業，除了提倡國貨；服用國貨以外，是沒有比較完善的辦法的。所以我們提倡國貨提倡了好幾年的宗旨，就在發展工商業。但楚不幸的很，經過了好幾年的努力，到現在還沒有什麼成績，這並不是提倡國貨與發展工商業沒有關係，而是沒有能雊萬衆一心，柑脚踏實地的提倡國貨工作。所以我們現在要想中國的强盛；工商業的發達，還得繼續努力！尤其是國貨商人們，更要在改良國貨；發明國貨上着手。但是我們的政府，對於國貨發明人也要予以相富的獎勵；社會上更要予以相當的援助。　　我們知道：在外國，無論是政府；是社會；對於某一樣出品的發明人，都給予非常的榮譽；和莫大的經濟上的帮助；所以外國的工商業能够一日千里。我國呢？一般人旣然因於經濟，不能雊孜孜研究，而且卽使發明一樣出品，政府和社會上也都漠然視之，於是就造成這種工業凋敝，商業衰落的現象。所以我以爲我們一方面應該提倡國貨；服用國貨；一方面應該改良國貨；發明國貨；而政府相社會上，對於國貨的發明人，更要給予　英大的帮助。這樣，國貨才有發展的希望。不知道政府當局和社會諸公以爲如何？開學聲中與國貨  喬耘飱　　流水般的韶華，忽忽是夏去秋來，現在已經從初秋爬上仲秋的時序；這兩天任何動盪的在潮，大槪都敵不過無形的開學聲浪，逆料本文和讀者相見之日，除掉有特殊情形的學校尙未正式上課以外，遠近的一片絃歌聲，已經繼續響亮了一二十日；在上月下旬，鄉鎭裏的少爺姑娘，伴着行篋向城池的道上走，求智於中學小學；城內的公子小姐，也準備向父兄要上躉批的花綠鈔票，負笈到都會，繳納預定方巾學士的代價；我們還記得「別矣××」的一夕，如今馬路上疾馳的汽車，只要看見行囊書篋纍纍，有呈現微笑的男女靑年安坐車廂，那麼你無用問得，準就是大衆日夕馨香期望的經世治國未來的主人翁；在這時學生諸君，應該醒覺到民族的危機，要負起昭蘇經濟的副責任，因爲你們的家長，和社會的大衆，能有這百業蕭條的巨濤中，維持繼績你們的學業，這是匪易的非常遭際！或問學生如何裕國？服用國貨，就是你們愛民族的天職；同時應該知道，今年是「學生國貨年」！何况這學生國貨年，已到殺尾的幾個月，常言道：「年怕中秋月怕半」，月過十五，自然未來的天數日少，現在由秋已去，二十四年的日曆是日漸單薄了；我們知道開學聲中，爲家長者是枯魚拮据時代，獨有學生是經濟常裕時代；經騐吿訴我們，讀書是智識進化的利器，但是每個學生消費在求學方面的究屬有限，大約僅佔百分之三十吧？其餘呢，物質文明的消費，倒要佔百分之七十咧；旣然如此，我們也無法節制你們的物質消費，只有盼望你們添一履一襪之微，一筆一墨之細，都有精良的純粹國產，期待諸君去選擇購買；一位學生痛下這個决心，就在富國道上拉進一分一釐，全國學生痛下這個决心，那麼民族經濟的發展，就不可以度量計了；學校訓敎導師們，在上紀今周講堂的餘暇，請你們用誠懇的態度，介紹你們信任的幾件學生國產用品；學生國貨年推行聯合會諸位先生，請你們在這開學聲中，多派幾位幹員，分赴各校去演講些推行國貨的方法，使學生知所適從；學生圑體主幹先生們，你們與其敎同學出任什麼國貨宣傳員，何如在這開學聲中，敎同學先從本身做起，免得錢用光了，到各處去空喊口號呀。提倡國貨與展覽  方正　　偶然翻閱機聯會刊，讀到有一篇展覽狂之日本，作者是潘仰葊先生。略謂：「日本產業之發達，不但注意量的方面，同時並注意於質的方面，吾嘗推究其致此之由，則政府之提倡，與社會之鼓勵，實爲最大力量，而原動力則在種種展覽會。幾至年年有會，月月有會，日日有會，處處有會，通商大埠有會，窮鄉僻壞有會……舉其要者，有提倡家具博展覽會，國產用品展覽會，子供用品展覽會，婦人用品展覽會，染織品展覽會，美術品展覽會，種類之多，難以僂指。而目的所在，無非本相觀而善之旨，相與比較參考，策勵精進，所謂由比較而競爭，由競爭而進步，日人確有此種現象。故每開一次展覽會，政府及地方機關必不惜巨資，竭力予以獎勵，而出品者之興趣必增多一次，其出品改進之機會，亦必添加一次。因果相循，於是日本人之出品，遂日以精進矣……」在這工業幼稚的我國，潘先生這一段話，的確値得注意的，茲把個人的意見，貢獻如下：　　組織展覽會—工廠家或同業公會應當聯合起來，組織展覽會，舉一家大工廠爲會長，每月由會長發起展覽一次，或是幾月展覽一次，展覽的時候，大家比較出品之劣優。日久自然得益非淺。　　各地展覽閱開展覽會，不限都市爲然，就是各鄉鎭，也得去展覽。因爲那些鄉民，何嘗不知道買國貨？但是沒有人吿訴他們，况且國貨又不是常給他們看見的，因此祇得走上「盲人騎瞎馬」的路途上去了；所以展覽會在鄉鎭一開，至少會使他們反省的，甚至下次就不會購買外貨了。這不是一舉兩得嗎？　　政府及社會應予以獎勵—日本人開展覽會一次，他們的政府及地方機關，必定給他們臍勵一次。我國政府及社會也應當倣傚，派員參觀及嚴格批評，劣者則勸其精細改良，優者則予以獎勵，能如是，則國貨前途，必有發展之希望。參觀中華煤氣車製造廠記　　—木炭汽車之發軔—　　（天然）　　木炭汽車，　諸衆口久矣，試用者不乏其人，讚美者已　各地，爲國家前途計，更値得提倡。良以年來吾國公路事業日就發達，全國月須消耗汽油在一百萬加侖以上，以後安通日發展，其汽油之需要，將十倍此數而未已。夫以本國不產之汽油，而日日仰給於各邦，一旦國際戰事爆發，汽油來源，頓吿斷絕，則全國數萬輛之汽車，必將悉成廢物。木炭爲中國最富之產物，就地取材，不假外求，大可利用以替代汽油，當然値得提倡者也。昨日記者承向君次濤王君總善之招，參觀其所經營之中華煤汽車製造廠，詳細參觀，極感心得，略記大槪，以紹介於邦人。　　是廠在華德路三〇九號，於民國二十二年一月設立，同年六月開工，民國二十三年十二月向實業部註冊，專以製造煤氣車媒氣船及煤氣發動機，（如打水機及發電機等之動力機械）並兼營貨物運輸部。向君爲總經理，王君爲恊理，總工程師爲向德君。當向君試騐之初，耗資甚巨，而蟬精竭慮，卒告成功。去年十二月向實業部註冊，獲有專利權，迄今已製成四百餘組，各公路長途汽車公司以其出品成續優良，無不樂予採用。現每日可製木炭汽車一組，各公路定貨已至本年十一月，每組現售四百五十元。採用者如蘇嘉路·江西公路，寧鎭慈路·蕭紹公路·錫澄公路·杭徽公路·觀曹公司·廣泗四路以及各公司之運貨汽車。最近各轉運公司採用之外，軍用汽車，亦已大批採用，總計該廠之銷路，已達鄂·湘·贛·皖·浙·蘇·閩·粵·蜀九省，最近冀·魯·滇·甘·桂，　等省，亦在接洽之中。其工廠設備，頗爲完善，各項機器亦應有盡有，細密工作，叉與中央研究院合作，尤爲美備。其運輸汽車，運費極廉，而效率與尋常汽車相等，一部分且與鐵路營業所合作，計有汽車八輛，均利用木炭。此項木炭，來自溫州蘭溪居多。目下該廠擬改爲有限公司，購地另建新廠，擬大量生產，由配造進而爲製造完全之木炭汽車，以期發揮媒氣之效率。並擬製造特種燃料，以求適合煤氣爐之用。復擬推廣煤氣發動機，俾應用於農村打水及發電等工作。據向王二君云：每木炭十市斤，卽可代替汽油一加侖，如本市汽油每加侖現値九角，木炭每百市斤値銀二元，卽以値二角之木炭，可抵値九角之汽油，可以省費百分之七十七，其功效之偉可知。該廠所有木炭車之模型，自創製迄今已有十餘型之多，最新者爲二十四年B式，其裝置圖樣，及各部分之名稱，則有發生器，除灰器，濾氣器，調氣器，催氣器，給水器，等，每次置足發生器之木炭後，可供八十華里至一百華里之用。目下並能停車過夜，第二日開車時，可以無須引火，尤爲便利。向王二君認此爲極有興趣之工作，孜孜不倦，以求隨時之改良，時時欿然不肯自滿，尤爲可敬。並謂各方如有不明之處，深願作義務指導，以貫澈其國產燃料不假外求之目的。其眼光與主義，尤可贊美。是日參觀計二小時半，向王二君，詳加導引，毫無倦容。並悉海上製造木炭汽車廠，是廠以外，尙有仲明華强二家，但最先得租界照會者，卽爲是廠。租界車務處，對此木炭汽車，初頗懷疑，列舉條件，如淸潔，衛生，溫度，加速，慢速，停車，開車，載重，障故發生與否，及其修理之法，加添燃料之手續，及燃料消耗等，均由向君等備車以供餒格的試騐，始予核發，更非易易　記者以此項事業極有研究價値，故鄭重記述以告邦人。仿製洋酒之先鋒  惟爲　　我國製酒多以米麥糯等穀類，而洋酒除用穀類外，多用葡萄，在我國以葡萄仿製洋酒之先鋒，則爲烟　張裕葡萄釀酒有限公司之創辦人張培士，然其動機則遠在遜淸光緒十七年（即一八九一年），當張氏在荷關時，宴於法國領事館，初次飲備萄　製之酒，覺其味甘芳可口，顧而樂之，遂立意在華仿製，後歸國，以烟臺氣候地土宜於葡萄，乃以三百萬元巨欵，購地數千畝，由歐洲著各產酒之區，運得葡萄多種，聘有澳洲製酒專家盬督試種，而採其最適合烟臺地土氣候之種，加工培植焉。　　一該公司除有廣大葡萄塲外，鑑於外國科學之進步，故在煙臺設有偉大化騐室，從事研究改良種植與出品，由此可見創辦者之締造，固非易易也，其次爲貯藏問題，因酒味之醉厚芬芳，越久越佳，故該公司以巨欵建有極大之地窖，其面積與法國之最大酒廠相伯仲，窖內滿列木桶，桶之大者能容酒一萬六千公升，貯藏相當時期後，方始出售，該公司尙未以爲足，力求進展，設有偉大蒸酒廠，出品精益求精，有一可雅酒者（俗稱白蘭地）其角香味皆與舶來品相埒，並有一華茂孚三紅酒一等類，亦足與外貨相頡頏，又聞該公司行將發售葡萄汁云。　　以上種種仿製洋酒，不獨質佳味美，日定價尤廉，不及舶來

<p>春秋點滴  （淸癯）　　昔時洪水滔天的當兒，據說：只有水而沒有地了：後來善於治水的，知道這個這理，不必去治水，而只消去治地，就可够了；於是第一區別地域，其次度地之宜，去地之梗，最後使地的高且峻者，定一個固定的地位，地治了而水也大治。　　現在降災的要算是天，而不曉得受這患難的是地，浩浩蕩蕩汜濫於中原的是水，其實奔逃無所，而不免葬於魚腹中的是人；然而惟原禍始，與其責備天，母髯怪怨人，因爲黃河决口，不是眼前這一回，而歷來常有的事；以前不至有這樣的出險，全仗河防人員平時的準備，倘禍到臨頭，靠着搶險築堤的力量，那還來得及麼？　　所以治水之法，相水之性爲要，合併的宜疏，沈滯的宜瀹，遲緩的宜扶，潺濁的宜排，然後水源的通塞，乃可明白了了，而水患可以平；你苦不是的話：行甩河伯作虐，永遠沒有波平浪靜的一天，而變爲水鄉澤域的地方，不止銅北一帶吧！唉—禹王不生，其魚之歡，也徒然了。花選中之二老  孫籌成　　此次本市各界籌賑水災游藝會，舉行花選時，內有二老，甚爲出力，可稱老當益壯。此二老者，雖非天下之大老，亦可稱上海之二老。論其年齡，均已古稀，言其聲望，全國皆知。一係我禾之沈淇老，（名衛，字淇泉，前淸太史公。）渠之筆墨，頗有根蒂，對於小品文字，用典古雅，久爲文壇所推崇。此次當選之花國總統，國務總理，參衆院長，以及才貌品性藝術各部總次長，與總統府顧問諮議，照例均給以證書，以資信守，頒賜區額，以昭激勸。證書之文，係淇老所撰，將各省水災奇重，亟須救濟，特發起花選，以籌振欵之用意，完全寫入，用四六文體，詞藻並美。匾額所題之句，確合當選者之職位身份，而含深意，如題術部總次長，曰「神乎技矣」，與「有勇知方」，眞語妙雙關，出神入化，苟非老手，曷克臻此？大總統就職之夕，洪老特率家人，親住參加，坐於台右，雖已蓄鬚，然一種瀟酒風流之態度，不减張緒當年。一卽人稱阿德哥之虞洽老，（名和德，字洽卿，前上海總商會會長）八日夜間舉行就職典禮時，渠親赴大總統雪飛之花邸，恭迎至會，小心翼翼，保護上樓，而入休憇室，敬茶送烟，意甚殷勤。幷於大總統登堂時，以手作勢，令來賓全體起立，以表敬意，而不隆重。當給予「見義勇爲」之獎章時，親自替其佩於胸際，散會後，因聞三十六個黨欲道喜而討賞錢，恐　動極峯，又躬送至總統私邸，如保鑣然，沿涂担任警備，謔者比之爲總統府侍從武官，洽老亦笑而承認云。賞月追記  吳蝶　　今年中秋，適大風雨，一日之間，炎凉懸殊，昔人所謂「一雨便成秋」，洵不我欺。隔昨冰仙電話，謂購冠生園「銀河秋月」月餅四圓，得有靑陽港賞月專車票兩紙，邀我陪游，已許之矣。至是，風雨無已，正憂犬不做美，而冰仙電話又至，郊行雨阻，權游竹林如何？因思良朋殷動，盛情難却，於是報可。隨喚街車，冒雨而去，迨宵深返寓，雨已止，而月娥仍匿其嬌面也。　　閱宿晨興，披覽申報，則冠生園廣吿在目，始知靑陽之遊，改期今宵舉行，比散値歸，家人吿：冰姑有電，重踐前約，申初北站相見，乃促家人拚擋晚餐，隨赴其地，晤泳，携手上車，車八節，可容千人，七時，車蠕蠕動，車窗遙矚天際，銀河如洗，廣寒仙子已不復如昨宵之靦觍矣。　　執事人以一賞月特輯」及糖果餅點進，殊周到，一時車停，適在靑陽港畔，客絡繹下，步鐵橋而止於鐵路飯店，沿途分懸五彩電燈，光映波面，水粼粼作魚鱗紋。港側停小艇三五，待客而動，時薄雲掩映，明星出沒，銀月隱現靡常，雋侶四百餘人，進屋後草坪，坪鋪一碧，面積廣坦，主人洗君，邀客席地坐。致謝辭，攝影畢，有口琴合奏，名歌星及票友會唱，皆大歡喜，旋各起參觀旅舍，鐘十一下，始乘原車歸。　　其間尙有一事足述者，當羣坐草地時，某夫人挾其男友飮於賓館酒排間，喁喁作軟語。忽一男子直入，夫人面頓頳，急趨避，不及，男子遽掌女頰，而男友已鼠竄去，意者，某夫人或中良人之計也。比車至，夫婦已和諧，同車而歸，亦賞月趣聞也。　　來函　主筆先生大鑒：敬啟者，敝人現從事於中國古代印刷術專集之編綦工作，本平日研討所得，知中國爲發明印刷術最早之國家，但關於始創者之歷史，殊鮮記述遺傳。例如生於紀元前一千年之活體字發明家畢辛（譯音）Pishing與死于紀元前九五四年之板型發明家馮道等，雖於斷簡殘篇，略有窺及，大抵語也不詳，毫無系統詳備之專籍。叉如用板印刷一術，考諸史籍，當中國之隋朝時代，已早產生，但欲於文字中求詳盡之記載，而足資參考者，竟不多覯。久仰貴報讀者不乏高明淹博之士，如有對於該項學術具有淵邃之歷史學識與參考材料各種紀錄等項，使敝人親炙聞命，賜予敎益，則感激無旣矣。請將敝人原函刊登貴報，至感至禱，此上敬頌，撰安愛多亞路一六〇號中華大學圖書公司經理裴士謹上，九，二。凌波仙子  涓隱九一八的諧音  （嚴芙孫）　　九一八的痛史，在人們的心絃上，劃着一道深刻的創痕，舉目河山，不堪回首。舊友瑯琊生，他最近從奉天法庫縣，道出申江，舊雨重逢，欣然道故。他說：他在法庫，小住三月，全縣的人民，受着暴力的脅迫，眞個生死兩難啼笑皆非。他們處這國破家亡的境地含着而淚，天天祈禱着我們去援救他，日復一日，年復一年，他們也就死心塌地了。瑯琊生問問他們，對於年年的九一八，作何感想？他們含着苦笑道：唉！可憐呵！九一八……救也罷！不救也罷！他們這悽厲的呼聲，竟把「九一八」，轉到「救也罷」的諧音。他們滿腔裏的憤鬱，却也難怪其然，唉！救也罷！不救也罷！這兩句沈痛的呻吟，眞可算是如怨如慕，如泣如訴，哀猿啼血，誰忍卒聽呢？小西天  張恨水著　　第十九回　大員惜羽毛敲門有術新歡離骨肉探病無由　　藍夫人一個翻身由床上坐了起來，問道：樓下人者散了嗎？我料着他們蚯蚓發蛟，也生不出多大的風浪來。則誠笑道：倒不能那樣說。據我打聽、這裏有一位縣長，有一位銀行經理，他們不答應，還要登報。藍專員道：是嗎—你何以知道？則誠道：就是那個姓張的，親自在樓下和他們接洽，我親眼看到的。我看這些旅客，不少是由南方來的，他們多少有些力量。眞是他們打起來了，我們不過吃一點眼前虧，那還沒有什麼要緊。若是他們把這消息傳到南京去了，對我們很有不便。我們原是調查民間疾苦來的，雖不必要老百姓歌頌我們的德政，可是走來西安，就這樣給我們反宣傳一下，就算中央不理，或者不相信，在西安也就不容易再作出體面事來了。藍夫人聽了這話，心裏又軟了半截，因道：我倒不想小西天這飯店裏，有這樣能搗亂的人。登報我也不怕，這地方的報紙，難道就不歸中央管嗎。若說歸中央管理，他們就不能駡中央來的大員。藍專員到了這時，紫色的臉子，可就不能再鎭定了，取下了嘴裏雪茄，速在烟缸子上敲了幾下灰，因道：哼！你怕什麼？倒下天來，有屋頂着呢，只是我可找誰去？你說報紙不能駡中央大員，他憑什麼不敢罵我？我能封西安的　館嗎？你　說大話救命，剛才那麼些人要打上樓來，你怎麼不出來？倒躺在床上抖顫。（三一九）御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　逢到國緻姨的時候，太后還歡喜親自挾着一柄小小的金剪刀，帶着我們一羣人，親自走入花圃中去學做園丁；當然拕泥挑水的工作伊是絕對不會嘗試的，伊只是相帮着捉捉蟲，澆澆水。偶爾瞧見有一枝花梗上蓓蕾長得太多了，爲恐花朶開得太小的緣故，便揀那些未長成的蓓蕾酌量剪掉些，這是太后本人也通曉一切園藝常識的表顯。此外伊便祇剩着利用那一柄金剪儘揀合意的花卉剪下來取回去的份兒了。　　我還記得有一天的深夜，時辰鐘大約已打過了三句鐘的樓樣，外面突然下起雨來，粗大的雨點，一陣緊似一陣的在各處宮殿的屋脊上跳着，響着，終於把太后在睡夢中驚醒了。　　「啊！不好了！我們那些才長成的菊花怎樣經得起如此大的雨呢？伊很急迫地在枕上喊着：「這雨一定要把他們一起打壞了！誰在這裏値夜？快去通知那些太監們……，」　　這一夜，恰好是輪到我在太后寢宮內値夜；每逢値夜的日子，我們照例都是不敢睡熟的，所以太后一說話，我就打地上站起來了。待伊的話才說完，我診來不及的趕將出去。那些値夜的太監却並不敢走進裏面來，都在外邊廊下站着，或蹲着，有的也像我們一般地直僵僵的靠在牆上打盹。（四一九）小食譜談月餅  南宮生　　在這桂子飄香天高氣爽的時間，正是月餅應時的時候。我國各地，月餅一品，部視爲中秋節必備之品。所以這一個時期，出售月餅的商店，不知有多少，還有特地設攤，製月餅應市的商人，沒一處不是利市三倍，可見月餅的在中秋，是家家不可缺少的東西。在廣東，有一句關於月餅的谷彥，「當了衣服乞月餅」，說尙是一所房屋，住着啦家人家，一家買了月餅，那一家當了衣服，也得買幾個月餅來應時，這般看來，月餅在廣東，竟特別的重視。　　月餅的出產地，差不多令國都有，著各的地方，要推到廣東，蘇州，北平，和浙江等各地。廣東月餅，式樣較大，種類亦多，有許多奇怪而風雅的名目，如銀河秋月，七星伴月等等，這都是因了月餅的餡不同而特題的名色。廣東月餅的餅餡，有種種不同，大概可分爲蓮蓉，奶油運蓉，蛋黃蓮蓉，都以蓮子爲主，和以奶油，鹽蛋黃，欖仁所製，棗蓉，豆沙，豆蓉，金腿，五仁，甜肉，鹹肉等餡，金腿，甜肉，鹹肉，都用瓜子仁欖仁杏仁等爲主，金腿加以火腿，甜鹹就在滋味上分別，同蘇式月餅火腿鮮肉等不同。蘇式月餅，扁而蛟小，餅餡有棗泥，夾沙，豆沙，金腿，鮮肉，三鮮，自糖，百菓，玫瑰，芝蔴，椒鹽等許多。兩種月餅，都有葷素之分，葷的和以猪油，素的便是素油。北平月餅，却與蘇廣不同，都是白色，高起似扁　，餅饀也與蘇式相同，不過只有棗泥，豆沙，山楂，玫瑰等甜的。其餘各地，大都似蘇式月餅，祇在形式上稍稍差別而已。　　潮州雖在廣東省內，月餅却有如蘇式月餅的一種，餅餡以豆沙和東瓜爲最好。蘇州周莊，陳墓等地的月餅，械爲著名，以豆沙的一種爲第一，入口而化，比了蘇廣等地的月餅，遠勝多多。月餅的短處，是在太甜而膩，周莊陳墓等地的月餅，可以避免這一種弊病。　　顧淸桂餅詩：寳鈿和露壓金英，爲趁秋光一日成，月殿有人留素影，花林無物稱佳名。所謂桂餅者，便是月餅。　　在上海一區，每年月餅的消耗，達一百萬元，聽了可使人昨舌不止，倘是把這月餅消耗的金錢，救濟了災民，豈不是功德無量，然而奢華的上海居民，那裏有這種慈悲的心腸呢？</p>

<p>自由談太平天國三字經  寒峰　　太平天國「三字經」的發現，在我可說是一回奇跡。因爲這樣一部啟蒙的書，於許多關於太平天國的書裏，好像始終不曾提到過。大槪抄錄者也是當時的一個「有心人」，他把太平天國刊行的許多小冊子，都輯抄在起，成了一厚本，並把每種都註明了出版的年代。其間的一種就是「三字經」。這抄本是很舊的、顯然是當時所錄。於「三字經」下，註有「太平天國癸好三年鐫刻」十字，可見此書係何時印行。而我們也可想見，在戎馬倉皇之中，太平天國是怎樣的在化着力量，從事於自己的文化建設，以及太平天國文化的宗敎的基礎爲何如。想不到此書沉沒了百年，竟無意的被發現了出來。是眞可寳，特錄之以吿關心太平天國文化者。至其內容，實有如基督敎之宣傳品。此不僅「三字經」一書爲然，其他種種，莫不如是也。「三字經」的全文如次：　　皇上帝　造天地　造山海　萬物備　　六日間　盡造成　人宰物　得光榮　　七日拜　報天恩　普天上　把心虔　　說當初　講番國　敬上帝　以色列　　十二子　徙麥西　帝眷顧　子孫齊　　後狂出　鬼入心　忌興旺　苦害侵　　命養女　莫養男　煩役苦　實難堪　　皇上帝　垂憫他　命摩西　還本家　　命亞倫　迎摩西　同啟奏　神蹟施　　狂硬心　不肯釋　上帝怒　降蜢虱　　降螳螂　及蟾蜍　匐進宮　逼入爐　　不准放　海化血　飮苦水　麥西國　　降瘡疥　及瘟蝗　降重雹　最難當　　終不放　殺長子　麥西狂　無法使　　乃釋放　出麥西　皇上帝　甚扶持　　日乘雲　夜火柱　皇上帝　親救苦　　狂硬心　帶兵追　上帝怒　發天威　　到紅海　水汪汪　以色列　實驚慌　　追兵判　上帝攔　親打戰　民無煩　　令紅海　水兩開　立如牆　可往來　　以色列　邁步行　如展旱　得全生　　追兵過　車脫輻　水復合　盡淹覆　　皇上帝　大威權　以色列　盡保全　　行至野　食無糧　皇上帝　諭莫慌　　降甜露　人一升　甜如蜜　飽其民　　民多欲　想食肉　鶉鴿降　千萬　　　西奈山　顯神蹟　合摩西　造碑石　　皇上帝　設天條　列十欵　罪不饒　　親繕寫　付摩西　天上法　無更移　　傳至後　暫不遵　中魔計　陷沉淪　　皇上帝　憫世人　造太子　降凡塵　　曰耶穌　救世主　代贖罪　眞受苦　　十字架　釘其身　流寳血　救凡人　　死三日　復番生　四十日　論天情　　臨昇天　命門徒　傳福音　宣詔書　　信得救　得上天　不信者　定罪先　　普天下　一上帝　大主宰　無有二　　中國初　帝眷顧　同番國　共條路　　盤古下　至三代　敬上帝　書冊載　　商有湯　周有文　敬上帝　最慇動　　湯盤銘　日日新　帝命湯　狂其身　　文翼翼　昭事帝　人歸心　三有二　　至秦政　惑神仙　中魔計　二千年　　漢武宜　皆效尤　武臨老　雖悔悟　　少壯時　旣錯路　漢明愚　迎佛法　　立寺觀　大遭刦　至宋徽　猶猖狂　　改上帝　稱玉皇　皇上帝　乃上主　　普天下　大天父　號尊崇　傳久載　　徽何人　敢亂改　宜宋徽　被金據　　同其子　漠北朽　自宋徵　到于今　　七百年　陷溺深　講上帝　人不識　　閻羅妖　作怪極　皇上帝　海底量　　魔害人　不成樣　上帝怒　遺已子　　命下凡　先讀史　丁酉歲　接上天　　天情事　指明先　皇上帝　親敎導　　授詩章　賦眞道　帝賜印　並刺劍　　交權能　戚難犯　命同兄　是耶穌　　逐妖魔　神使扶　紅眼睛　即閻羅　　最作怪　此蛇魔　皇上帝　手段高　　敎其子　制服妖　戰服他　不放寬　　紅眼睛　心胆寒　戰勝妖　復還天　　皇上帝　托大權　天母慈　最恩愛　　嬌貴極　不可賽　天嫂賢　最思量　　時勸兄　且悠揚　皇上帝　受世人　　仍命子　降凡塵　送下凡　囑莫慌　　有我在　作主張　戊申歲　子煩愁　　皇上帝　乃出頭　率耶穌　同下凡　　敎其子　勝負祖　帝立子　存永遠　　散邪魔　威權顯　審判世　分善惡　　地獄苦　天堂樂　天做事　天祖當　　普天下　盡來王　小孩子　拜上帝　　守天條　莫放肆　耍鍊正　要歪心　　皇上帝　時鑒臨　要鍊好　莫鍊歪　　自作孽　禍之階　愼厥終　惟其始　　美毫釐　失千里　謹其小　愼其微　　皇上帝　不可欺　小孩子　醒精神　　天七法　不饒情　善降祥　惡降殃　　順天存　逆天亡　皇上帝　乃神爺　　萬物件　依靠他　皇上帝　乃從父　　虔服事　獲祝嘏　順肉親　享遐齡　　能報本　福本應　勿奸淫　勿汚穢　　勿說謊　勿殺害　勿偷竊　勿貪懈　　皇上帝　法最嚴　遵天戒　享天福　　謝天恩　食天祿　天福善　禍淫人　　小孩子　正其身　正是人　邪是鬼　　小孩子　求不愧　帝愛正　最惡邪　　小孩子　愼莫差　皇上帝　眼恢恢　　欲享福　鍊正來。　（三字經終）　　據抄者所開目，尙有「幼學詩」一卷，惟現已不存，想係失去，殊爲可惜！此書開卷，蓋有二龍戲珠圍邊硃印，印文僅宋體「旨準」二宇，約四寸通方。叉記云：「外有出麥西國一傳一部，不知卷數若干，會見過第二卷一本，共計四十章。書言大不可解，大約多番語。其所叙地名人名，亦世所未經見，誠怪書也。」此當是「舊約」中「出埃及記」。好的理想  嚴以霖　　高爾基在秋夜中曾說過：　　「好的理想是不大到女人們的頭腦中來的，但是，你看，她們也一樣的不大去找好的理想！……我常常重視好的理想，而且常常勞力充分利用這些理想。」　　使我戚到額外有味的，是後尾的兩句；我想這位露西亞的巨人所以巍巍，是很可從這兩句意味深長的話里，悟山一些道理來。　　巴金君在他所譯的原故事的譯者序上有着如下的一段話：　　「據說，露西亞人是善於做夢的。他們眞是幸運兒！H．T．S．說過：世間最偉大最耐久的東西就是做夢的人底手工成績。不能做夢的行動的人便是毀壞世界者；他們是興敦堡一流的人物；這些野變的力量要想留點痕跡在時間之沙上面，除非先把時間之沙浸透了人血。只有像高爾基和托爾斯太那般善於做夢的人才能够從海洋與陸地底村料中建造出一個仙話，才能從專制與受苦之混亂中創造出一個自由人底國土來。」　　高爾基，曾以偉大的美麗的夢，或者說由於他努力利用他的「好的理想」，終於把輝煌的足跡，印在時間之沙的上面。這里有値得我們深思的一點：「好的理想」於人們是如何的重要。　　美國馬爾騰在，“Training　for　Efficiency”一書中，於一篇篇名夢想者中曾說：　　「凡是一切世界上使人生有價値，把人類從卑賤中釋放出來，把人類從凡庸醜惡中舉拔出來的東西，——人生之安舒幸福——我們都得感謝我們的夢——想者。」他又曾說：　　「人類最神聖的遺傳，就是那善於夢想的力量。只要你相信一個較好的明天會到來，則今天的痛苦對你不算什麼。對於那些眞善於夢想的人，甚至「鐵窗石壁也不是牢獄」。」　　當我們讀到那些珍珠似的語句，我們能不奮起麽？「好的理想」能使我們的「生存」變爲最有意義的。名（下）  周文　　「呵呵，想不到今天在這兒遇着您。」老王握着他的手掌大聲地說。「最近好嗎？太太怎麼沒有一塊兒出來玩？最近文章寫得多嗎？哈哈，最近你不是又有一篇文章發表嗎？」他說着，一面把眼光向着旁邊站住的六七個吃驚的臉嘴一掃，他的麻臉便點點發光，更加興奮起來了，覺得自己和米薔蝴先生都好像高高地站在人們的面前。米薔蝴先生也立刻很興奮了，也把眼光向那六七個吃驚的臉嘴一掃，也滿臉發光，鎭靜地說道：　　「呃呃，不多，不過篇把而已」自己也好像斗然特別高了起來·　　「哈哈，那很好，那很好的·」　　博士帽的小白臉遠遠看見老王笑喀嘻地動嘴唇，叉把那握着「紫色領帶的人」的右手上下地搖了兩搖。可是就在這時候老王那眼光却對直射過來了，「唉唉，不行了，走吧。」他伸手把袋子里的皮夾子摸一摸，撒開腿才踏出脚步去，老王的麻臉却已出現在面前了。　　「呵，老張，幾天不見啦！我剛才還看見你的愛人密斯劉剛回她家去呢。」　　「呵，哦哦……」博士帽的老張無可奈何站住，嘴角勉强露出微笑來。但覺得旣然碰面，只得應酬幾名：「呵，剛才你同那一個談話的是訛？」同時准備再說一聲「再會」，便跨開脚步·　　「他？是我的一個很要好的朋友·」老王伸出一雙手掌拍拍他的肩頭，說·「老米·就是那個爲「戀中戀」的老米。你不認識嗎？」　　「是米蔷蝴先生？」老張一下吃驚地把眼光射過雜誌攤去，却正碰着米舊蝴先生射過來的眼光。他趕快避開自己的眼光，收回來，深深地盯住老王的兩眼，似乎說，「哦，我眞沒有想到你居然有這樣的一個作家朋友！」　　「是他。」老王昂着發光的麻臉答道·「要會會他嗎？」「很好·」老張兩眼發光地，馬上跨出脚步道·「很好·」　　米薔蝴先生和老張，由老王站在中間伸出右手來介紹了之後，老張立刻兩頰紅噴噴地從袋子里摸出兩角錢來，喊醒那一個正在張着吃驚的嘴吧望着米薔蝴先生的店夥，把錢放在他伸出來的一隻手掌裏，自己便拿起一本「滿新雜誌」來，興奮地說道：　　「眞是久仰得很。我今天就是特地來這兒買這本雜誌去拜讀的。我們到一家酒館去隨便談談，好嗎？」他伸出右手去，五指伸直，加添道。「老王我們都是好朋友。」　　「呵呵，不必客氣，不必客氣。我馬上還有點要緊事要到別處去。」米薔蝴先生說着，但兩脚却沒有動。老王却伸出一隻手爪來，一把抓着他的左手臂說道：　　「走吧。都不是外人。我們的張兄早就是仰慕你這大作家的。」他掉過臉來，向着老張伸出一隻手掌道：「你有零塊的錢嗎？我去買一聽烟來。」　　「呵呵，有有。一老張運運點頭的答道；立刻伸手在袋子里摸出一張一元的紅色花紋的鈔票來，放在老王的手掌里，同時興奮地兩眼閃光地說道：　　「請你順便帮我給密斯劉打一個電話，好嗎？請呌她一定來，給她說，我們今天有米先生。」祖孫  天基母與子  江岳浪　　零落不堪的古亭裏，　　她坦開了胸，露出了臂，　　一身包骨的乾皮，　　孩子橫躺在她懷裏。　　破爛的被堆在角裏，　　陣陣的風透出臭氣，　　她短促的呼吸，　　支持着着一絲生氣。　　小孩身上只留着烏黑的皮，　　沒有動已似死去，　　黃叶兒打上她的頭頂，　　纔見小手在舉。　　她身經不起風吹，　　絲絲的氣息在着發抖，　　她的腰徐徐的彎了，　　瘦臉靠近孩子的頭。寄宿舍（三）  J.喬易斯作立波譯　　莫里太太從空想覺醒，聽到喬治敎堂的鐘聲停了，她立即本能地戶縣着壁爐上的鍍金時鐘。七點過十七分了：她要花很多的時間和多蘭先生澈底談判，然後到馬波羅街去用中飯·她信她會勝利。省先，一切社會的輿論的重量都在她這方面。她她是一個强力的母親。她讓他住在她的房子裏，想着他是一個體面的人，他却乾脆地糟踏了她的厚遇。他三十五歲了，因此，年輕不能作爲他的免罪的口實；而且因爲他曾見過世面，不知道法律，也不能作爲託辭。他完全利用了波利的年輕和沒有經騐：那是一目了然的。問題是：他應當怎樣償報？　　在這種塲合，償報是必要的，對男子倒很便當；他獲得了快樂的瞬間，可以若無其事地揚長而去。可是女孩子却不得不忍受一切。有些母親會以一筆金錢草草完事爲滿足；她曉得了許多這樣的例。可是她不要這樣。對於她只有一種償報可賠償她的女兒的名譽損失：結婚。　　她又斟酌了一次，然後差了馬利到多蘭先生的房裏去說她要和他談話。她確信她會勝利。他是一個嚴肅的靑年，不和旁人一樣輕浮或高聲。如果是雪利東先生或米德先生或利奧斯好鬥的矮子，她的工作要難多了。她並不想他應當公開。宿舍的一切住客都知道了一點；有些人還揑造了許多細節。此外，他在一位天主敎的大酒商的事務所服務了十三年，公開出來也許會使他失業。只要他同意了一切都好。整如，他的薪金很豐，她猜想他已經略有積蓄了。　　差不多半點鐘！她站起來，在穿衣鏡裏照照自己。她的大大的緋紅的面孔的决斷的表情使她滿意，她想起了她認識的許多不能嫁出她們的女兒的母親。　　多蘭先生這個禮拜天早上的確非常不安。他試了兩次想修修臉，但是他的手非常顫動，他祇得中止。三天的紅　鑲着他的下　，每過兩三分鐘，一層迷霧濛在他的眼鏡上，他不得不取了下來，用他的手帕揩拭。他昨夜的懺悔的回憶是他劇烈的苦痛的原因；牧師誘導他講出了每一個可笑的細節，後來又那樣將張了他的罪過，使他覺得只要有一個償報的出路就要感激得很。錯已鑄成，現在除了和她結婚或逃跑他還能雊做什麼呢？他不能厚顏處此。事情一定傳開了，他的老板一定已經聽到，都伯林是這樣一個小小的城市：一切的人都曉得別的一切的人的事。他感到他的心臟熱辣辣地跳到了喉頭。，在他的興奮的想像中他聽到了劉奧納得老先生嗄聲地叫着：『請喚多蘭君來。」　　他多年的服務全都化爲烏有！他的勤勉全都拋了！自然，年輕的時候，他曾任情揮霍；在酒店裏他曾向同伴們誇過他的自由思想，否認過上帝的存在。可是那一切都差不多過去了。他每個禮拜還要買一份雷洛德報，可以他却盡心宗敎，一年的十分之九度着規律的生活。他的錢很雊安家了。，那是不成問題的。但是家裏人會瞧不起她。首先她有一個不名譽的父　，其次，她的母親的寄宿舍有着某種名聲。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言義亞問題與中國人  吹　　前見天津大公報社評，題曰「義亞問題與中國人」，其結論曰，「中國不勞多問義亞之爭，應速自理中國之事，關心義亞，母寗關心中國，蓋中國非亞國可此云云，，信哉斯言，眞俗語所謂「養媳婦做媒人，自顧不周，且莫談他家婚事，」故該文論點的本身，無論何人，不敢加以非難和反詰。　　惟該文推想，謂「國人注意義亞問題之原因，殆慮義亞戰起，則影響歐洲，歐洲亂成，則中國更受危迫·」此種推測，不免不合邏緝，中國人旣想不到，看不見，擺在目前的危機互患，還想得到因歐洲亂成，連帶而及於吾國的危害，中國人的腦筋，恐不見得這種複雜麽？　　該文又謂，不過中國人，因義亞問題，亦得到重要的啟示，（一）列强之鈎心鬥角，各爲已謀，（二）時代的背景，有經濟上迫切的理由，（三）因亞國情形，更證明積弱無備之國家，其運命如何悲慘，此種啟示，原是人人所能見得到，看得出，然試問用何法去關心耶，用何法去解脫耶，願夫子明以吿我。　　中國人關心中國之事，除幾位醉生夢死，日沉湎於燈紅酒綠的花花公子外，對中國的事，自然極其關心，假定國家到此地步，火已燃眉，而仍漠然若不聞也者，則除非天然生成的奴隸動物，方能有此現象，否則何至凉血若此耶。　　現在一般人所以僅談義亞而不談中國，我想有兩種理由。（一）亞國處境的痛苦，無殊於吾國，不是爲意國所獨佔，便是爲列强所宰割，談亞國而我國之運命於此可見一斑，則所以謀自力更生之道，亦在於此。（二）所謂遠東問題，則問題不過及於遠東而止，而義亞戰爭，其勢必波及於全歐，或竟爲二次大戰的導火綫，亦未可知，觀於近日歐洲的新聞，不是說意國的軍隊，迫近埃及邊疆麼，不是說英國在地中海積極備戰麼，因爲英國對於菲洲的關係，固有其特殊情形，决不肯讓意國去獨佔亞國也。月夜山行  勞心　　當我决定了要離開故鄉的時候，已經是快要到中秋節了。於是朋友老麥，這個常常跟我一樣傻的傢伙，他約定了我在中秋節那一天晚上帶了鷄和酒到白雲山摩星嶺去飮，一來賞月，二來結束了我們其同的荒唐行動的一段落。本來白雲山我們已經跑得討厭了，不過晚上的還沒有嘗試過，而且老麥在荔枝灣那一天晚上對我說：假如我走了，他一個人沒有伴决不會再有這一種聊以發洩的舉動了，於是我只好答應了下來。到現在隔別了一年的孤零零地度過這樣的一個中秋節的晚上想起來，更加覺得那一次的舉動，雖然是荒唐，可是也足値得懹戀的。　　决定了的約，我們是决不會反悔的，於是到了中秋這一天便忙着辦理了一切手續。鷄買了一雙整的，老酒打了一玻璃瓶，並預備好了月餅，柚子，橄欖之類，等待吃完了那一頓過節夜飯便準備着出發了。起先，老麥家里的人都來勸止，說我們都是瘋子，才有這近乎瘋的舉動。我們沒有否認，但是我們除了神經質地處理我們的生活還有什麼方法。於是我們開始我們的步行了。　　天上的月亮可以作證，我們還是年靑人咧。我們背上了東西，把城市撇在了后頭，走出了到沙河去的兩旁都植着樹路上。我們有時吹着口翠，有時胡亂地縐幾句屬於雄壯調子的粗魯歌曲。除了姣美的月姐兒外，什麼人也看不到我們的狂態。　　然而，這才是一個活坐生的人啊，難道拘束而禮貌的紳士們會這樣地做一個「眞」的人嗎？　　山路是崎嶇的，不過憑了我們往日走的經騐，和天上的月亮的鼓勵，我們仍可以摸索前進。起先到了彌勒寺，果然給一些看守的兵阻着了，於是我們便决定了越山了。爬山的本領在野孩子的我們是看家本領的。於是我們象沒有困難地前進着。一會兒幾乎迷了途，而四面一些鳥嗚獸叫叉非常地龐什的聲音，使我們都變成了提防的步伐，慢慢地前進着。　　夜的山是非常美麗而雄壯的，尤其是加上了月亮的撫摩和反映。我們雖然在走着不可知的危險的滿堆着不穩的石底山路，可是心里是非常愉快的。忽然，老麥對我說：　　「我們走着的都是這樣的不可知的路啊，誰會想到前面是一條什麼的路咧？」　　「我要走的也是這樣的不可知的路啊！」　　我趕着回答的時侯，他忽然地失了一足，跟着一顆不穩的右頭滑了一脚下去。我一手扶了他，開玩笑地說：　　「不要說話，我們只要走！無論它通或不通·」　　這樣我們便更穩健地挺着了年靑人的勇氣，一步一步踏着崎嶇的羊腸小道向前走着。皎潔的月亮照着我們純潔的年靑的心，崎嶇的山路更穩健了我們的步伐。卒之，我們經過了白雲寺，到了摩星嶺了。我們佔着了那破藍的堡壘，我們用酒來溫暖我們的熱力，用肉來充塞我們的肚子，我們都不約而同地歡叫起來了：我們完了我們的希望。病與夢  沈塢　　永遠隨着時間之流駛，把生命從崎嶇的狹道上一天一天的縮短下來。是一個無從解釋的宇宙的謎，這個謎把人的生死隱隱地掩藏着了。在整整的一生中，沒有什麼比彌留之一剎那間更寳貴的了，無論是誰，只要你不是愴卒地死去，這一剎那之間一定有你非常可愛的回想的。只可惜這是在你整生之中底最後的一次了。　　我曾經這樣想過：難道不能有一次比這可怕的彌留之頃更費貴的回想麼　在奔逐着的歲月之中，事實上就好象吿訴了我：這個答復已是肯定的了。於是我不時沉着了腦子去回想，有時在夢裏也去追逐着那些可能給我再回味的往事。……終於，我不曾在在這之間找出了一些什麼寳貴的回想來。反而在夢裏把我的頭髮漸漸地花白了去。當我淸晨在鏡子裏照到我一根一根的頭髮，日漸地變成白色了時，我驟然想到我該距離那個可怕而又可貴的時間不遠了，我以極坦然的，悠閑的態度，去靜候着牠的到來。　　但是，—不知是誰在作弄着我呢？永恒的歲月是持續地奔流過去了，但這樣的日子卻老是不會到來，我雖則不會焦急，然而我卻不再相信會在畢生之中，只有這可寳貴之一瞬了。在一個冷寂的淸晨裏，我突的就從這樣沉湎的夢境裏突破出來。　　我望望周圍，一樣是先前的那樣孤寂，院落裏已經飄下了片片的落葉了。窗　凝住了一些蜘蛛網，我正要走到窗前在把窗子推了開來，突然，有一個人來阻住了我：　　「你不要把窗子開了哪，外面有風」！　　我頺然地把軟癱的脚拖回到床前，跌倒了。那個人立刻跑了過來，輕輕地把我摸撫着。隨後，我淸晣地看到他那一撮花白的鬍子，和那雙慈鮮的眼睛，我猛可地記起了他，原來就是服侍我的老僕，—阿韋。　　啊，多麼可怕的悠長的時間哪，我在這院子裏居然冷落地，昏迷地度過了一年的光景了。我在床上輾轉反側，一時淸醒，一時迷亂地睡了一個年頭兒。不是阿韋說，我幾乎不知道我倒底是爲了什麼來的，現在，我是明白了，我受了創傷，我曾經在這兒昏迷地垂危過不知多少回了。然而我爲什麽不能在垂危中之　去獲得一些兒寳貴的回想呢？…　　看看阿韋的臉，在額角上好象又比一年前增多了幾根皺紋，一簇鬍子長得更長了。摸摸自己的上巴，卻一根鬍也沒有。我想，也許我離開那個寳賣的一剎那間還遠吧？抬頭望望天際的雲　，望望遠山的景色，自己象是想鼓起脚步往外邊馳去了。</p>

<p>過嶺  耶戈　　初秋的夜是這麼的輕巧，排麗，天上掛着的滿月，好像是一個白衣少女在淡藍的天空欵步。　　我們這一羣：十三個，年靑而且男敢的土木工人，誰也沒言沒語的，讓沉重的包袱駄彎弓背脊，路着悶窒而且疲備了的步伐，默默的向山途行進。　　工頭珍老爹又大踏步從背後　　不，用他那　　的　喉嚨喊道：「上了嶺頂，咱們便停下歇息。」　　誰也沒去理會他，大家在默想着自己底心　哩。於是，他又祗得默默的撑在背後，嘴里喃喃的哼着山嶺路崎：「山嶺路崎遠，未知西天値一方，下去救母不管山高嶺路遠，樹林烏暗，看許林內障烏暗……」　　右誰在低聲的呢喃着，一會又大聲的哄笑起來。有人拍着手笑道：「老爹你人老，心還沒老哩。」　　珍老爹磕上嘴，又趕着跨開步跑到前頭來，使勁的笑道：「不快活又有什麼鳥用！咱不比你們年靑人……俗語說得好：老年人是風頭灼，說不到過學這麼一年半載，便要躲進棺材裏去哩。」　　「老爹也說的太過，誰人不知道你有吃了九十九歲的好運氣？……」有誰打趣的挿嘴說，逗的大家都笑了。　　「九十九歲咱們啃番薯根的可配不上，這只有叫大城裏那些吃洋參高麗的大富大貴人才配。老子今年算來也是上了五十的人，十二歲起跟人家出門當小工，忙這忙那的大年頭忙到大年尾，到現在又剩了個什麼鳥？可不是和三四十年前一樣啃番薯根，住破房子？幾十年來的苦工已苦的我够了再活上這麼一二十年那可連老子這兩根骨頭也要磨折哩……」　　珍老爹說罷話便感慨地大聲嘆息起來，他底眼睛變得灰暗了，人看來也變得更爲短小萎弱，好像是一條病虫在那兒慢步的爬着。　　大家爬上山坡，便沿着石砌一層一層的望嶺上爬去。　　四周沉悄悄的，舒暢的微風從田野上帶着穀香吹來，山坡下水田上的稻海縮瑟的低聲嘆息着，好像是一陣從草原上吹來低抑的田園交響樂。　　我們大聲的喘着，一步步地爬過石砌。上了嶺頂便歇息在土地廟前的一株萬年松下，大家卸了包袱，從肩膀上扯下汗巾揩去面上的汗漬，又掏出旱烟筒想抽，有幾個便轉到古松後去小便。　　突然一陣吃驚的慘叫把衆人愕住了大家驚慌還沒定時，那幾個轉到古松後去小便的人已大踏步跑出來，氣吁喘喘的，遍身顫慄，嘴裏吃驚的狂號着：「快走！快走！苦啊！……」　　大家沒來由的也嚇的從地下扯緊包袱，望嶺下跨開步便奔跑。珍老爹脚手本來已是遲鈍，又兼是新吃了驚嚇便遠遠的掉在背後，大聲苦苦的叫道：「你們，你們……要死大家在一起！！……」　　大家也忘的去理會他，一口氣奔下嶺來，好容易才在雨亭上停下喘氣。一會珍老爹也趕了下來，他氣喘地大聲喊道：「……你們，年靑人……要死大家在一起！……」　　進了雨亭他便拍起手坐在地下受了委曲似的元自嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來：「要死大家在一起！……」大家忙把他勸住，靜聽一個小夥子講話——　　「……你們想我怎不着急哩。我扯下褲一眼便看見他掛在松幹上，像吊桶似的一個大頭顱，眼睛微閉，嘴巴張開，露出兩排白牙齒得滿面血漬的，在斷到下頷下的那個頸子還在滴着血水哩。在他底光腦袋上便打着一個窟窿挿着一把紅旗子，上面寫着一些歪歪斜斜的大字，我沒有看淸楚他，便說的拚命跑出來……」　　大家緊張鬆了口氣，老爹却站着起來憤恨的拍着手道：　　「這樣算做後生家嗎？連一個死人頭也嚇的這樣……」　　沒人去理會他，大家歇息了一會，便又乘着初秋的月色跨着步望山坡下走了。孩子的奢侈  敬嘉　　為了業務的關係，自己常常弄到半夜才能安寢。自然囉，一盞電燈也得陪着我到半夜才能熄滅的。誰知這一來，却把那初生不久的孩子養成一種愛光亮的習慣了。他一定要看着電燈光才會安寗，才會熟睡。要是沒有電燈的話，他就呱呱地哭起來。孩子雖是一個很小的嬰兒，但哭聲却極大，非但在房中聒吵得不堪設想，就是住在樓上的房客也會因他的哭聲而感到不安的。　　自己原是一個性子很暴燥的人，但這暴燥的性子對於孩子却毫無用處。當他哭得響亮的時候，雖會引起我的憤怒，但是又不能打他，打他就更哭得響些，又不能駡他，駡他他還不是一個「不懂」！如果讓他哭下去吧。又對不住人，而且自己也不能安睡的，因此只好把電燈通宵達旦地亮着了！　　孩子滿足了，但自己却來了煩惱。因爲我知道這樣弄下去的話，電燈費一定很可觀的。　　「這還了得！該多少錢付電燈費！自己一個月能賺多少錢！」我向妻嘆苦。　　妻也只好在兩難之間默默地不開口。　　結果是不會出乎意料之外的，電燈公司的賬單寄來了，銀額此前兩個月多上二倍。要占我那活費的全部的十分之二呢！　　付過了錢，一個月約所得便毫無剩餘了。望着那酣睡着的孩子，我感到做父親的痛苦了。　　而且，這還是我第一次的感受倒做父親的痛苦呢！將來，那茫然無際的將來——　　我不敢望下想了。播音節目新歌介紹　　夜來香　　王乾白作詞　嚴工上作曲　　賣夜來香！賣夜來香！賣夜來香啊！花兒好，白又香，花香沒有好多時光；人怕老，珠伯黃，花兒也怕不久長，愛花的人兒快來賣，莫待明朝花不香！買花費不了你錢多少，賣花也好養爹娘，賣夜來香！賣夜來香！賣衣來香！歌唱　　夜鶯藝社　　國華（一二〇〇）下午五時至六時　　柳搖金（前奏曲）牧羊女（秦茵）嫁給與士吧（曼娜）休息五分鐘（曼琳）丁香（露茜）人間汕子（流朗）偉次的手（秦茵）四時吟（曼娜）花生米（露茜）　　中華（一一四〇）下午七時一刻至八時　　新戀（前奏曲）聲聲慢（曼娜）小姐我要你一切（露茜）我的愛人就楚你（曼琳）（流朗）新女性（曼娜）美麗的靑春（露茜）愛的花（秦茵）再見吧故鄉（流朗）　　美玲團　　航業（一一八〇）下午六時至七時　　新毛毛雨（前奏曲）母親（天一影片）（靜美愛的徬（雪麗）舟中曲（佩佩）夜深深（程瑩）吹泡（英英）定情歌（桃花扇）（賴玲）花弄影（雪麗）鐵蹄下的歌（佩佩）張家的莊子（程瑩）（英英）　　安定（八六〇）下午九時至十時　　跳舞救國（前奏曲）我們的皇后（最後）矣巴黎（浪浪）慈母搖籃曲（露茜）農村之歌（流朗）愛情如玫瑰（秦茵）薔薇花底（曼娜）燕隻飛（曼琳）夜月之歌（露茜）逃亡（秦茵）　　星星歌唱社　　新新（七八〇）下午六時至七時　　慢牛快馬（葉英）女軍人歌（朱琪）倚江樓（白燕）催眠曲（胡蒂）十六歲姑娘（葉英）寒衣曲（白燕）萬里　見　（王蝴）蝴蝶姑娘（朱琪）</p>

<h3>Dongzhuang Dam Project Funds: Central Government Approves Additional One Million Yuan Appropriation; Economic Committee Telegraphs Han That Project Should Proceed as Originally Planned</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Han Fuqu, citing economic difficulties in Shandong Province, telegraphed the Economic Committee regarding the Dongzhuang dam project, requesting that the Yellow River Committee oversee it. On the 18th, the Economic Committee replied as follows: "All aspects of the Dongzhuang dam project rely on administrative forces to supervise and carry it out. Your provincial government has already prepared and is actively proceeding with the dam project. We urge you to exert your utmost effort and continue to be responsible for handling it as originally planned. As for the needed funds, the central government has approved an additional one million yuan, which will be promptly allocated for use." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Kong Xiangxi telegraphed Han, stating that he deeply admired the thoroughness of the dam project plan and had instructed the Ministry of Railways to expedite the allocation of needed vehicles. Furthermore, the dam project committee, facing difficulties in transporting stone materials, decided to use brick made in Dongzhuang as a substitute. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>After Shuyang Breach, Chaimi River Also Overflows; Water Level of Liutang River Reaches Dike Crest; Yongfeng Dam Successfully Blocked</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Following the breach at Yangkou in Shuyang, the south bank of the Chaimi River overflowed again, causing severe disaster in the western part of the ninth district and the northern parts of the eighth and seventh districts, as well as the townships of Taiping, Luyou, Chainan, Jingnan, and Jiyi. County Magistrate Deng has telegraphed the provincial government's Construction Department to report the disaster situation and also telegraphed the Yishu River Tailwater Flood Prevention Office to report the water situation. Generally, the right bank of the Chaimi River has overflowed, and the left bank is nearing danger. The upper reaches of the Shu River have dropped by half a meter, while the lower reaches are still rising, but the people are still able to work hard to prevent further breaches. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) At noon on the 17th, the Yongfeng Dam north of Yangzhuang in Huaiyin was overflowed by rising water from the Yan River, and the head of the embankment poured directly into the fourth district of the county through the People's Convenience River. The county government, based on reports from the township chiefs, dispatched technician Jin Jufang to conscript laborers to block the breach. It was reported at 5:00 AM this morning that the work had been completed. It is understood that this dam is downstream from the mouth of the People's Convenience River, which flows into the Yan River, and leads directly to Liutang. If not for the tireless work of five thousand laborers throughout the night, the fourth and fifth districts would certainly have become a waterlogged area. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Se Xun: The water level of the Liutang River has reached the crest of the dike. Residents along the banks are mostly building village embankments for defense. In the Qijip area of Shuyang, the 80-kilometer dike and the more than 20-li dike on the north bank of the Chaimi River are all seeping water, creating an extremely dangerous situation. The river water is still rising incessantly. County Magistrate of Shu County urgently requested the provincial government to use blow-out dams to divert the water. Pi County telegraphs that the Yun embankment section of the Shanhekou section of Pi County has collapsed. Now the water is advancing north, inundating the Pi-Guan Highway, and rushing fiercely northward, causing a major disaster in northern Pi County. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Special Commissioner's Office received reports that the water level of the Hanzhuang Lake mouth rose by 7 centimeters, the Bulao River rose by 3 Chinese inches, and the water level of the Wei Lake also rose by 1 Chinese inch. It is believed that the water from the breach in western Shandong is continuing to flow downstream. However, the rise is still slow. The Special Commissioner's Office has issued orders to all counties to continue to strengthen their defenses. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Pi County telegraphs that the water has not yet receded. The county seat is currently still safe, but the worst-hit disaster area accounts for six administrative districts, seventy-six townships and towns, with 100,000 elderly and weak, 250,000 women and children, and 150,000 able-bodied men affected, resulting in losses of more than 3 million yuan, a situation of extreme misery. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Today, the Wei River rose by 4 centimeters, reaching 36.847 meters. The Yao River rose by 3 Chinese inches, reaching 262 Chinese inches. Suqing remains stable, but the Yan River is expected to rise. Liutang is flowing downward due to overflows and breaches in the Shuyang area. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Seepage at the Base of the Southern Gate Embankment in Yaowan</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Suqian News: Seepage has appeared at the base of the southern gate embankment in Yaowan Town in the county. It is said that the seeping part contains a lot of soil, and the sand is unusually loose. County Magistrate Zhang Naifan has reported the situation to the Grand Canal Flood Prevention Office, requesting measures to protect it, and has telegraphed the merchants and residents of Yaowan to prepare to relocate to a safe area. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The focus of flood prevention has recently shifted to Yaowan, so the east side of the river there is already in danger, and the west side is only remaining on the brink of one. If the Yun embankment between Huangdun Lake and the Central Canal is not protected, the lake and the river will become one, which would be detrimental to the downstream counties. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Wang Gongyu Returns to the City from the Disaster Area</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wang Gongyu returned to the city today from the Tongbei disaster area. According to him, the dikes that were repaired after the storm are now all complete. However, the people who built the dikes are exhausted, and the disaster caused by the water is extremely tragic. From now on, all efforts should be concentrated on relief work. After supervising the dike construction and flood prevention, Wang inspected the disaster area. The water situation and the disaster situation are unprecedented. Wang nearly died when the storm broke the dike. Yu Jingtang sent a telegram of condolence and representatives from the Provincial Committee in Xuzhou sent comfort.

<p>Preparations for Relief Efforts in All Sectors</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) As the weather turns cold, all sectors here are actively preparing to select relief supplies for flood-stricken areas for epidemic prevention and relief. The committee members of the National Government Relief Committee are eager to see Chairman Xu Shiying come north. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shao Hanyuan recently agreed with Zhu Yuwu, a member of the Finance Department, and Hao Ru, the president of the Agricultural Bank, on the establishment of food storage and pledge warehouses in the disaster area, and measures to protect draught cattle in the disaster area, which have been submitted to the province for approval and will be implemented soon. Shao has instructed all counties to prepare to start the work. The Yunlong Mountain Shelter has taken in many disaster victims. Pei, Feng, and Pi counties have also set up shelters to provide Chinese grain. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Leaves with Funds to Inspect Disaster in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shiying went to northern Jiangsu on the evening of the 18th to inspect the flood disaster, bringing with him more than 10,000 yuan to be handed over to the local authorities for relief. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 22nd to attend the Huai River conference. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Cheng Jingsheng, the relief director of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, recently came to Xuzhou with Qiao Baoyuan, an expert in humanitarian relief, and others to investigate the disaster. In recent days, they have set off separately to various counties to investigate. Because the disaster is so severe that a small amount of relief funds cannot solve the problem, he has telegraphed Kong Xiangxi, the president of the Shanghai Provincial Flood Relief Association, to report and request a large amount of funds. Cheng said that the disaster in Pi County is the most serious, requiring 300,000 yuan. Tong and Pei counties are slightly less serious, each requiring 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The breach at Dayushu in Pi County needs to be blocked, which is more urgent than relief. Cheng will meet with Xu Shiying and then return south to discuss relief measures with the provincial government. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Cheng Jingsheng inspected the disaster situation in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway today and went to Dayushu breach to investigate. He saw that the breach was 60 zhang wide and the flood was vast. No one has yet proposed blocking it, and the civil laborers are not reliable on their own. He telegraphed Kong Xiangxi, president of the Charity Relief Association, to urge the China International Famine Relief Commission to send personnel to Xuzhou to discuss work relief to block the breach, which can enable 500,000 mu of wheat to be planted and save the lives of 100,000 disaster victims. Work relief is estimated to require 10,000 yuan. Cheng believes that the opportunity cannot be missed and suggests quickly blocking the breach in western Shandong as a way to clear the source of the disaster. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Judicial Conference discussed a total of 15 review reports from the first group, 19 from the second group, and 8 from the third group at its third general meeting on the morning of the 18th. The most important item was the proposal submitted by the Judicial Yuan regarding the transitional measures for the judicial organs and judicial facilities to be funded by the state. The resolutions passed were: 1. Judicial funding should be implemented as soon as possible according to the resolution of the National Financial Conference, with the national treasury responsible for it; 2. The detailed rules should be negotiated by the Judicial Yuan and the financial authorities; 3. Income tax, inheritance tax, and other fixed tax revenues should be used as funds; 4. Before the national treasury fully assumes the responsibility, all judicial expenses should still be borne by the provinces. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Judicial Conference continued its third meeting at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th, chaired by Wang Yongbin. It discussed a total of 44 review reports from the third and fourth groups. Among them, the proposal that lawyers should be allowed to perform their duties in the court of a county magistrate concurrently handling judicial affairs was the most fiercely debated. After Shi Zhiquan explained the review opinions and the representatives spoke, it was decided to return it to the review committee for reconsideration. The meeting then reconsidered two proposals: (1) Trial implementation of the circuit court system, which was decided to be submitted to the Ministry of Justice for consideration and implementation; (2) Regarding the transitional measures for the judicial organs and judicial facilities to be funded by the state, the resolution of the morning meeting was revised to: 1. All judicial expenses of each province should still be borne by the provinces before the national treasury fully assumes the responsibility; 2. The national treasury should use income tax, inheritance tax, and other fixed tax revenues as funds, and the detailed rules should be negotiated by the Judicial Yuan and the central financial authorities. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The review committees held meetings at 8:00 PM in the evening, and the fourth general meeting will be held on the morning of the 19th, and the review committees will meet at 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An expert said that the National Judicial Conference has two major characteristics: (1) Except for the new Yunnan-Sichuan border area, which is inaccessible due to transportation, all other provinces and cities have sent representatives to attend. The unification of the judiciary can promote general unification. (2) In addition to the reform of judicial administration, the proposals all pay attention to whether the current laws are suitable for social conditions. This conference may be able to integrate law and society. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the reception hosted by the Minister of Judicial Administration for the experts of the Judicial Conference, expert Zhang Zhiben said in his speech that he had two points to make about this Judicial Conference: 1. To promote judicial progress, there must be precise planning and a legitimate organization; 2. The judiciary must have an independent spirit. Regarding the first point, it can be divided into two levels: A. The establishment of trial members is actually an illegal organization. Now that the Court Organization Law has been implemented, the trial member system is no longer permitted by the law; B. There should be a unified regulation for judicial funding. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Judicial Conference sent a telegram to comfort Chairman Chiang and the generals at the front: "The stubborn bandits are being punished, and the six divisions are marching westward. We admire your hard work in enduring the cold and heat. The encirclement is complete, the command is decisive, and the task of sweeping the nest is not far away. The public praises your efforts. The conference decided at its third general meeting today to express our sincerity and send this telegram of condolence. We look forward to your triumph and are eager to see it."

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops and Police in Yuguan Prevent Travelers from Leaving the Pass</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the 16th, the puppet police in Shanhaiguan have suddenly prevented people from leaving the pass. Travelers have been turned back to Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and other places. Even travelers who have purchased puppet exit permits are not valid. It is rumored that the plague has spread from Tongyuan in the Jin-Sui area outside the pass and is very rampant. The puppet authorities are preventing the spread of the epidemic, so they are prohibiting travelers from entering the country. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently in Yuguan, the autumn harvest in the counties of eastern Liaoning has passed, and more and more people are going out of the pass to make a living.

Since then, passengers have been stranded on the train for more than a thousand people each time the train arrived in Yuguan.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Incident and Italian-Ethiopian Incident</h3>
<p>In recent years, there have been four international disputes handled by the League of Nations that deserve more attention: (1) the Manchurian Incident; (2) the Chaco War; (3) Germany's rearmament; and (4) the Italian-Ethiopian Incident. The League of Nations cannot be said to have not done its best in handling the Manchurian Incident. However, the result that China obtained was nothing more than the "autumn crabapple leaf" form being maintained in its entirety "on the map." The Chaco War, because both sides were small countries and evenly matched, the League of Nations seemed to handle it more smoothly. The German rearmament issue was felt to be thorny. Germany was like a tiger escaping from its cage. To oppose it would be to incur its anger. To comply with it would be impossible to justify. It was impossible to turn Germany back. It was allowed to leave without regard for appearances. The Italian-Ethiopian Incident is the most similar to the Sino-Japanese Incident. The League of Nations had already dealt with the Sino-Japanese Incident inconclusively. Italy's relationship with Ethiopia, although they are also one strong and one weak, but behind Ethiopia is a strong and powerful assistance, which is not comparable to China. Will the League of Nations also be able to deal with it inconclusively?</p>
<p>The British Morning Post quoted Italian Prime Minister Mussolini as saying, "Whether the war will happen or not is not in the power of Italy, but in the power of Abyssinia and the League of Nations." His intention seemed to be that if the League of Nations recognized all of Abyssinia as an Italian colony, and Abyssinia did not take a resistant attitude towards Italy, then Italy could avoid war. However, the reason why Abyssinia is preparing for war today is also because a large army is pressing on the border. Rather than dying without a fight, it would rather die fighting. This is exactly the intention of preferring to be shattered like jade rather than surviving like a tile. Moreover, fighting still has the hope of survival.</p>
<p>As for the League of Nations, it can be said to have exhausted its ability to compromise in the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. The five-member special committee organized by the League of Nations has drafted a solution based on the Anglo-French proposal at the Paris conference in August, proposing to amend the border between Ethiopia and the Italian colony, reorganize the Ethiopian police force, and have technical advisers hired by Ethiopia, while still respecting the sovereignty of the Ethiopian Emperor. Although the Council has made revisions and deletions to this case, it is not likely to undergo any major changes in general. There were previous rumors that the solution would be that Italy's relationship with Ethiopia would be like England's relationship with Iraq, or that Ethiopia's economic rights would be given to Italy. However, the Ethiopian Emperor said that if anyone infringes on its sovereignty and territorial integrity, it will resist to the end. Does this current solution proposed by the League of Nations not infringe on Ethiopia's sovereignty and territory? If Ethiopia's resistance to the end is not just empty talk, it will not readily accept these conditions. Italy has already spent 200 million lire and wants to obtain this resource-rich land. If it does not satisfy its desires, it will not be able to give up. If the two countries unfortunately meet on the battlefield, will the great powers still take a bystander attitude as they did towards the Sino-Japanese Incident, or will they actively intervene? This depends on how Ethiopia handles its national crisis in the future.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Has Violated Common Principles of Universality; Representative Hu's Broadcast Speech in Geneva: China's Reasons for Requesting a Council Seat Are Sufficient</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Hu Shize, China's representative to the League of Nations, gave a broadcast speech at the League of Nations last night, clarifying the reasons why China is requesting to obtain a semi-permanent council seat in the League of Nations Administrative Council. He said, "China's request is completely in line with the universal principles of the League of Nations, so there is no reason for any country to oppose China's reasonable request. On the current council seats, there is no country that can represent Asia, given its size. China is not in the Administrative Council. Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations. Although Turkey is a member of the council, it is not sufficient to represent Asia in terms of culture and national conditions. The current composition of the Administrative Council is nothing less than a violation of the principle of common representation. Now, many in Chinese public opinion believe that the League of Nations has repeatedly failed in handling non-European events and will eventually only be able to advise on European events and protect European interests, without being able to reach events outside of Europe. China, with 450 million people, occupies most of the land in Asia, and its qualifications are fully qualified. If it is not able to obtain a seat on the Administrative Council, then why cooperate with the League of Nations? And there are those who doubt that China's support for the League of Nations and obedience to the League Covenant is useless. If the League of Nations can only protect countries with strong military forces, China, which has no military or preparations, has no need for the League of Nations and does not need to offer untimely loyalty to the League of Nations. This kind of unilateral theory does not represent the Chinese government, and even more cannot truly represent China's true interests, but more and more people believe it, and its potential power is terrifying. In order to eliminate this view, the Chinese government is requesting to rejoin the Administrative Council to show that the distribution of representatives in the Administrative Council does not violate the principle of universality. The Administrative Council recently suggested to China to consider adding a non-permanent seat if the Administrative Council could not add a permanent seat, which would make it difficult for China to join. Therefore, the method proposed at that time was to add a new seat. Negotiations between China and the League of Nations are still in progress, and it is hoped that China's expectations will be satisfied in the end. I have heard that representatives from some countries have not agreed in principle to the increase in the number of seats, and even if a seat is added, China may not be elected. I do not know why there have been several previous increases in the number of seats on the Administrative Council. Why is it not possible to add a seat this time? Moreover, Spain and Poland were re-elected after their terms expired, so why are they so stingy to China? Moreover, the importance of China obtaining a seat on the Administrative Council far exceeds that of other countries. At the 19th annual meeting of the World Federation of League of Nations Associations in Brussels, the British representative proposed to give China a seat, which was unanimously approved by the conference. The reasons given were the insufficient representation of Asia, the importance of China's position, the strength in construction, and the seriousness of the situation in the Far East. It can be seen that China's importance has been recognized by the whole world. China has made great progress in various constructions, especially in transportation, aviation, transportation, education, etc. Although there are natural and man-made disasters, it is still striving tirelessly. The future of creating a new China may be slightly delayed, but if it is pursued with unwavering sincerity, then the success of achieving unification through construction is not unknowable."

<h3>Five-Nation Committee Suggests Notifying Italian and Abyssinian Representatives; Laval Urges Aloisi to Return to Rome to Personally Seek Mussolini's Acceptance; Italian Side Believes Acceptance is Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Nation Special Committee's report on mediating the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has been finalized today. The suggestions within will be conveyed orally by the Special Committee Chairman Madariaga to the Italian and Abyssinian representatives. Replies from both countries are not expected to arrive here tonight. Members of the League of Nations are nervous pending receipt of the replies. However, various Italian circles here are not very optimistic. After learning the gist of the report, they all stated that, given the current approach, it would be extremely difficult for Italy to accept. It is said that the report's suggestions stipulate a grand plan for League of Nations trusteeship, implemented through ordinary advisors and provincial commissioners. However, the report, in its current form, does not reserve any positions for Italy. Many feel it is very difficult to force Italy to accept being a general advisor to Abyssinia. Any technical advisors will be appointed based on the Special Committee's recommendations, and the Abyssinian Emperor has full authority to bind these advisors. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, the suggestions clearly stipulate that there should be no military or political control by Italy over Abyssinia. It is also said that Abyssinia should announce its readiness to accept foreign assistance to develop and secure its territory. It has just been learned that French Prime Minister Laval strongly urged Italian Chief Representative Aloisi last night to return to Rome and personally implore Mussolini to accept the Five-Nation Special Committee's suggestions. It is said that Aloisi initially refused, as he was very unwilling to raise false hopes. It is now reported that Aloisi may comply with Laval's request. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to information obtained by our correspondent, Italian delegation members expressed disappointment when French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval discussed the outline of the resolution with Italian Representative Aloisi yesterday. It is therefore highly likely that the Italian government will explicitly reject this draft resolution. Although the draft resolution limits Abyssinian sovereignty, it still falls short of meeting Italy's demands. For example, the draft resolution advocates providing assistance to Abyssinia in administration, economy, and finance under the leadership of the League of Nations, and organizing an international police force within the country. Italy believes that the 1906 treaty granted it special rights, hoping to exercise a mandate in Abyssinia independently to pursue colonial endeavors. Italian sources also declared that the resolution formulated by the subcommittee is not only unacceptable to the Italian people but also sufficient to provoke their national sentiment. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Laval conferred with Italian Chief Representative Aloisi tonight, while British Under-Secretary Eden also met with the Abyssinian representative. Therefore, everything should become clear within 24 hours. After receiving replies from all parties, the committee will report to the Administrative Council. Then, the Administrative Council will convene a meeting to decide whether to proceed with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, i.e., whether to implement sanctions or whether there is still room for mediation. It is now believed that the report stipulates that a small corner of British Somaliland, up to the port of Zeila, and a corner of French Somaliland bordering it, be given to Abyssinia to compensate for Abyssinia's cession of land to Italy. However, this matter has not yet been definitively decided. The Anglo-French land concession will, of course, be conditional on Italy's acceptance of all the committee's suggestions. The committee, influenced by the speeches delivered during the League of Nations Assembly and the power of world opinion, seems to have strengthened its stance. It is said that the committee has secretly considered the countermeasures to be taken if Italy resists the League of Nations. Currently, there is only the issue of implementing economic sanctions, but how to make this measure most effective will also be carefully considered. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Laval is scheduled to return to Paris tomorrow. People here now believe that Laval's trip is to attend the crucial cabinet meeting on Saturday. At the same time, there are strong reasons to believe that Italian Chief Representative Aloisi has responded to Laval's request and will personally endeavor to persuade Mussolini to accept the Five-Nation Special Committee's suggestions. It is rumored that Aloisi may depart for Rome tomorrow. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It has been learned from the British side that the committee's report has already been drafted and will be submitted to the representatives of Italy and Abyssinia tomorrow so that the Administrative Council can discuss the report and the replies from Italy and Abyssinia on Thursday. French sources claim that the committee, after meeting today, inquired about the attitudes of several member states towards the report. It is said that Litvinov and the representatives of Turkey and Denmark solemnly stated that they could not endorse the suggestions because such suggestions are tantamount to undermining the sovereignty of another member state. (National, 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to sources close to the government, the Italian side believes that the suggestions submitted by the League of Nations Five-Nation Committee last night are unacceptable. Although their content has not been officially published, it is understood that they do not differ greatly from the suggestions made during the Paris Three-Power Conference. The Italian side also stated that it is ridiculous for Italy to be subjected to League of Nations tutelage. Mussolini is about to issue a new declaration to the cabinet and will simultaneously promulgate important military and economic decrees. (National, 18th)</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet Meeting Scheduled to Reconvene on Saturday; Important Decisions Expected at That Time</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italy remains unmoved by news of possible concessions from European powers, such as guarantees for the security of the Brenner Pass. The general situation is akin to a calm before a great storm. All hope is now focused on the Italian cabinet meeting today, where crucial decisions are expected. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's important cabinet meeting passed quietly, with a decision to reconvene on Saturday. It is widely anticipated that important decisions regarding the Abyssinian situation will be made at that time. A communique was issued after today's cabinet meeting, making no mention of the international situation, but announcing the issuance of new national bonds to cover the defense expenses of the East African territories. The amount of the debt was not specified, only an annual interest rate of 5% and a subscription price of 95 lire. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The communique issued after today's cabinet meeting, in addition to announcing the issuance of new national bonds, also stated that a small tax will be levied on commercial road transportation, and military pensions will be fixed under a fund to allow the government to compile a balanced budget for 1936-37. The communique also claimed that the number of unemployed has greatly decreased, that industry and commerce are very active, and that families have made progress in both harvests and prices. Therefore, the sacrifices that were considered burdensome to the economic situation a year ago can now be asked of the people. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After receiving the Five-Nation Subcommittee's suggestions for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Prime Minister Mussolini may convene a cabinet meeting tomorrow to discuss them. It is rumored that the cabinet meeting tomorrow will decide on various new economic measures to ensure that Italy's economy does not suffer in the event of war. The government has now implemented austerity measures, and various measures to import raw materials, such as kerosene, have increased prices. Strict control is being adopted for the construction industry, and the use of steel raw materials is being restricted. In addition, it is rumored that strict financial measures will be taken. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Well-informed Italian sources all say that the optimism in Geneva and London regarding the Five-Nation Special Committee's report should be encouraged. It is now believed here that, although the contents of the report are not yet fully known, some of its suggestions must embrace the opinions presented in the Italian memorandum, especially regarding the issue of slavery in Abyssinia. Italians regard the remaining points in the report as not very satisfactory. Italians do not currently hold out hope that the issue can be effectively resolved in Geneva. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Due to the urgent situation in the Mediterranean, the 30,000 troops previously prepared to sail to Eritrea have now been reassigned to Italian Libya. According to other sources, Italian troops are now concentrated on the Egyptian-Sudanese border, ready to attack Egypt in the event that Britain blockades the Suez Canal. (National, 18th)</p>
<h3>Sanctions Issue: Britain and France Still in Negotiations; British Reply to French Inquiry on Central European Issues Expected in Several Days</h3>
<p>(London) The French Ambassador, Corbin, previously inquired to the Foreign Office, stating, "Since Britain has adopted a resolute attitude in Geneva regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, will Britain adopt a similarly resolute stance in the future if Central Europe, especially Austria, is subjected to aggression?" Today, Foreign Secretary Hoare met with French Ambassador Corbin and indicated that the British government's response to the above question is not yet fully prepared, as he has not yet had time to consult with all cabinet members. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the question posed to the British government by the French government as to what attitude Britain will take if unprovoked acts of aggression occur in Europe in the future, it is now reported that the British Foreign Office will reply within a few days. The reply will likely be in writing and will adopt the policy expressed by British Foreign Secretary Hoare in his speech at the League of Nations Assembly, namely that Britain adheres to its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. The authorities have firmly stated that there is no misunderstanding between the British and French governments regarding the meaning of Britain's adherence to the Covenant. Therefore, people in British circles firmly believe that the British government's reply will satisfy the French government. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French observers, with regard to the Abyssinian question, are all focusing their attention on London, with Geneva or Rome taking a distant second place. The general public is eagerly awaiting the British response to the question posed by France as to whether Britain will be willing to implement sanctions against Germany in the future. It is hoped that the British reply will enable French Prime Minister Laval to reform the "Stresemann-Briand Pact." Therefore, the newspapers are still striving to engage in soothing persuasion towards Britain today. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The British cabinet will hold a full meeting next week to discuss the current international situation. At today's cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Baldwin first consulted with several cabinet members. The details of the meeting were not released. It is believed that Foreign Secretary Hoare presented a report on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Reuters has learned that Britain has not yet replied to France's question of whether Britain would be willing to impose sanctions on Germany if Germany invades Austria in the future. France is not currently pressing the British government to reply, as it believes that the matter has already been decided by Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in Geneva. Today's cabinet meeting lasted for one and a half hours. The ministers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Commerce departments all attended. After the meeting, Prime Minister Baldwin returned to Chequers. Unless there is an emergency, he will reside there until the end of this week. Foreign Secretary Hoare also went to Norfolk. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting this afternoon. The purpose of the meeting was not announced by the authorities.

<h3>Submarines Appear in the Mediterranean; Gibraltar Fortifies Defenses; British Warships Continue to Arrive; Aircraft Soar Overhead</h3>
<p>Madrid: The British battlecruiser Hood (42,000 tons) and Renown (32,000 tons) suddenly arrived in Gibraltar last night, followed closely by the armored cruisers Neptune, Valiant, Achilles, and Ajax, as well as fourteen destroyers. Furthermore, more battleships are about to arrive in succession. The north and south entrances to the military port have been closed, and the ships are raising steam, ready to depart. Military factories have been arranging decks and erecting cannons. According to sources from Tangier, a submarine of unknown nationality appeared in the Mediterranean. Upon hearing the news, the Gibraltar authorities immediately dispatched several light cruisers to pursue it. The submarine immediately submerged and disappeared without a trace. The ferries between Gibraltar and Tangier have now been equipped with four cannons. British aircraft are often seen soaring above the Strait of Gibraltar, and they are simulating attacks on warships near Algeciras. According to sources from Malaga, an Italian submarine will arrive there today. (National, 18th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: There are now fleets from more than a dozen countries in the Mediterranean, totaling over one million tons. Once the League of Nations sanctions order is issued, they will all be mobilized against Italy. The British fleet is certainly very busy with its movements. At the same time, Italy is densely laying mines in the Dodecanese and landing troops from ships. One British naval force is patrolling the Aegean Sea, while Italian submarines are also appearing off the coast of Alexandria. The British Navy currently has approximately 60 vessels near the Suez Canal, including the Courageous and Eagle, ready to be ordered to blockade the canal at any time. Furthermore, in southern England, there are 40,000 British troops, 300 tanks and artillery vehicles, and several squadrons of aircraft conducting joint exercises. (National, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to today's news, the British naval strength concentrated in the Mediterranean has created a new record since the European War. Part of the Home Fleet, which was originally scheduled to conduct exercises off the British coast, has actually sailed to the Mediterranean. The world's largest battleship, Hood, along with other battleships, Renown, Neptune, and the three Achilles, as well as eleven destroyers and one torpedo boat, have all arrived in the Strait of Gibraltar. The Greek Naval Department announced in Athens that around September 25, 26 British battleships, destroyers, and 45 other auxiliary ships will sail to Greek waters and be stationed in Corfu and Navarino. Ordinarily, the strength of the British Mediterranean Fleet is only 13 battleships and 20 destroyers. The current large increase in numbers is noteworthy. It is understood that Corfu is only 60 miles from the Italian border. Moreover, there have been secret deployments of warships from Singapore in recent days. At the same time, Italian warships are also unusually active in the Mediterranean. Today, six destroyers have arrived at the island of Leros, landing troops. Observers believe that the British naval activity may also have the assistance of the air force, as a squadron of aircraft has been conducting exercises in southern England. (National, 17th)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to the Al-Ahram newspaper, the British Navy currently has a total of 144 warships stationed in the Mediterranean, including 28 in Alexandria, Egypt, 20 in various ports in mandated Palestine, 6 in the Suez Canal, 20 in Aden, and 70, the largest number, in the Strait of Gibraltar. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Malta: Several hundred British women and children are now leaving here to return to Britain, many of whom are dependents of British troops stationed here. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Simla: During the Senate's discussion today about sending Indian troops to Abyssinia to protect the British Legation, General Chetwode, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, stated, "If we must fight, then let India be our shield." He also said that issues such as guarding Aden and protecting the oil supply in the Persian Gulf may require prompt decisions to be made on an ad hoc basis. However, if Britain is seriously drawn into the vortex of war, it should warn India early so that it can prepare calmly. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Britain's military precautionary plans in the Mediterranean have become the target of fierce attacks in the Tribune, which believes this defense plan is a preliminary sanction against barbarism and claims that Britain is no longer the protector of freedom of the seas but the jailer of the Mediterranean. The various military plans, especially those that Egypt has been forced to adopt, are driven by imperialist ideas. Therefore, Mussolini has every right to resist Britain. Although officials have denied it, newspapers here still claim that British and Egyptian authorities have approached the Senussi chieftain in Libya, advising him to rebel against Italy, and point out that British and Egyptian officials inspected the border between that territory and Egypt and Sudan several weeks ago in connection with this matter. The semi-official Italian newspaper, Giornale d'Italia, stated that the London Times expressed dissatisfaction with Italy's anti-British propaganda in the Near East, but that such actions are a defensive plan, actually necessary to explain Italian policy. (National, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources believe that the Admiralty will issue a communique this afternoon to explain the recent movements of its fleet, stating that they are purely routine actions in order to dispel any doubts held by the outside world. Officials declined to comment on rumors that a large part of the fleet will be sent to the Strait of Gibraltar, but said that the fleet will hold exercises in the Scottish waters, and the fleet currently stationed in the Strait of Gibraltar will also participate at that time. Under the current circumstances, the meaning of this move is particularly worthy of contemplation. (Havas, 18th)</p>

From then on, the effective period of the new Philippine political system will extend for ten years, at which time the United States will grant it full independence. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials here are extremely delighted that Philippine Senator Quezon and Osmeña have been elected president and vice president of the Philippine Republic. The general consensus is that this outcome will allow the Philippines to gradually progress from a semi-independent state to full independence in 1946. Because the senators have all departed, there is very little direct criticism of Philippine affairs here. However, the general public is very surprised by the small number of votes cast. (National, 17th)</p>

<h3>East Africa War Machine Pressing, Japanese Securities Market Active, Wartime Insurance Implemented at Sea, Seizing the Opportunity to Sell Straw Sandals</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Following the widespread news of the severe European political situation and the inevitable outbreak of the Italy-Abyssinia war, Japanese shipping companies and military industrial companies, regardless of their capital size or scale, are showing signs of activity. In particular, the securities market is reminiscent of the great boom of the past World War, and speculators are continuously placing orders, causing the Tokyo and Osaka exchanges to be in turmoil. This morning, the Tokyo market share price rose to 157.20 yen, the highest price since June of last year. (18th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A meeting organized by the heads of marine insurance departments of various insurance companies was held on the afternoon of the 18th. As a result of the discussion, due to the increasingly imminent crisis of the Italy-Abyssinia war, it was decided to formally apply wartime insurance premiums to goods transported to Europe, and to implement it immediately. For ships passing through the Red Sea, the rate for Japanese ships is one yen per 100 yen per day, and the rate for foreign ships is as high as 1.25 yen per day. (18th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>Osaka: As the Italy-Abyssinia dispute has reached a critical point, various parties are inquiring with the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry's trade section about which goods are suitable for export to Abyssinia. A speculative boom suddenly arose, and on the 18th, the section received an application stating that since the Abyssinian army is barefoot, there will be a need for shoes during the march. However, fearing that leather shoes would be uncomfortable to wear, it would be better to replace them with domestically produced straw sandals. The person hoping to sell this product is a Mr. from Fukui Dyeing and Weaving Company, and his wording is extremely serious. He strongly argued for the effectiveness of straw sandals for marching, providing lengthy and detailed explanations, and stated that if the Italian army spreads foot-burning chemicals on the ground, the Abyssinian army would inevitably welcome the benefit of straw sandals to protect their soles, which goes without saying. Furthermore, on the one hand, it would also contribute significantly to the revitalization of Japanese rural areas. He requested the Chamber of Commerce's cooperation, which would be greatly appreciated. The Chamber of Commerce believes that it is still unknown whether the Abyssinian soldiers, who boast of being barefoot, will actually adopt these troublesome straw sandals. Therefore, careful consideration is necessary before a response can be given. (18th, Japan United Press)</p>

At the same time, the permanent fund and social insurance measures will also be slightly changed to save 13 million guilders.

It is true that Germany's territory is small and needs to be expanded urgently, but it can wait for some time, perhaps even for several generations. However, work and raw materials are related to Germany's survival and cannot be delayed. In short, what Germany needs at this moment is colonies." (18th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Fu Bingchang's View on Debt</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiao Yitang proposed revisions to various articles of the Civil Code. Fu Bingchang held differing views, requesting that the principles for amending the Civil Code be based on the Party's ideology, emphasizing freedom and equality. The so-called right of women to inherit property is also a manifestation of the advocacy for gender equality. The article clearly stipulates that heirs are not responsible for repaying the debts of their fathers. If the father leaves an inheritance, the debts should be repaid first according to the law, and then the inheritance should be passed on. However, if the father leaves no inheritance but has heavy debts, ordering the heirs to repay them would trap them in debt for life, with no hope of ever being free. From a human perspective, why should they suffer this innocent fate? Therefore, this law resolutely breaks with that precedent. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jinan Communication Provincial Government Chairman Transferred and Replied To Han, formerly because of the Dongzhuang Yellow River closure breach, the central government funds allocated were few, the progress was difficult, technical personnel, especially extremely lacking, had telegraphed the Executive Yuan, please order the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to be responsible for the closure, Shandong Provincial Government is willing to assist with all its might, the Executive Yuan should approve and hand over to the National Economic Commission, the Economic Commission recently telegraphed Mr. Han, still order Shandong Provincial Government to be responsible for the closure, such as technical personnel lacking, can order the Yellow River Commission to assist, but Han because the province has 7 or 800,000 disaster victims, every day needing to eat, the weather is gradually getting cold, cotton clothing is still lacking, personally it is difficult to divide the mind, then ordered the Secretariat to draft a thunderous reply to the Economic Commission, please still assign the closure matter to the Water Conservancy Commission to be responsible, and also Han because the Yellow River breaks its banks every year, the fundamental reason, is because the riverbed siltation is too high, the fundamental method, should use the old Yellow River old channel, set up a sluice gate in the upper reaches, control the water volume, when the water is high lead the water to be discharged, has telegraphed Chengdu Chairman Chiang, requesting inspection and approval, the telegram said, "Chengdu Military Committee Chairman Chiang Junjian Jian, Dongzhuang breach, construction difficult cost huge, the industry is by this government organization closure engineering committee, actively preparing progress, after the autumn flood, it is possible to start construction, funds and materials are not lacking, the major work is easy to announce completion, I am mindful since I came to Shandong has exhausted cotton cloth, I only expect local security, may be quiet, this time suffering the Yellow River water catastrophe, disaster victims are no less than three million people, the disaster area has exceeded 5,000 square miles, and are all in the robust area of Western Shandong, displaced, appeasing and collating difficult, the territory and weather, drop by drop as an opportunity to create bandits, in the future bandit alarm, will be arbitrary, at that time even exhausting all the force or can collect the effect of appeasement, but the opportunity to create bandits is too much, at any time there is the possibility of bandit alarm, from then on the place is afraid that it will not be easy to have a peaceful day, this is not something that I am overly worried about, according to my humble opinion, the occurrence of the bandit disaster in Western Shandong, the yearly droughts and floods, are the biggest reason, the total vision is almost irresistible are the river disasters, the Yellow River entering Shandong increases suddenly in a narrow shape, frequent breaches, plus siltation, according to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission hydrological records, the Yellow River's rare flood volume over the years, can reach 23,000 cubic meters per second, the common water volume, 10,000 to 15,000 cubic meters per second, and the Shandong territory riverbed reaches 8,000 cubic meters per second, has entered a dangerous period, exceeding 10,000 cubic meters per second, it is difficult to avoid a breach, this year's Dongzhuang breach, the river water flowed south, flooding and seizing 70 to 80 percent of the main river, according to the Wangjialihang River water sediment content records, the Yellow River in August and September, the average sediment content is more than 6 percent, so the main river siltation is getting higher every day, the flow will necessarily decrease, after this closure work is completed, when the big flood comes next year, the river channel cannot accommodate, it will inevitably break its banks again, looking to the future, I shudder with fear, for the sake of the present, if we want to eliminate future river disasters, it is not easy to succeed unless we make the river water discharge, the water from the Dongzhuang breach this time, flows over the land, and there is no formal chute, to open a water diversion tributary river nearby, in fact there is no possibility, there is no other way, only to reorganize the old Yellow River channel, here are the proposed plans as follows, (1) to build a control gate on the right bank of the Yellow River in Lanfeng, Henan, to maintain the flow below Lanfeng, not to exceed 8,000 cubic meters per second, the remaining water to enter the Yellow Sea through the old channel, (2) to reorganize the old channel, so that the river channel capacity can flow at least 8,000 cubic meters per second, (3) to raise the levees on both sides of the Yellow River below Lanfeng, so that they can accommodate 8,000 cubic meters per second, check the old Yellow River channel, because the change and transfer has not been long, there are still many existing levees, with a little reorganization, it can be successful, building a gate and buying land, does not cost much, not only is the project easy to implement, but the terrain is even more favorable, eliminating the calamity and eliminating the bandit disaster, there is really no good plan, so I have telegraphed the local situation and the river conditions in summary, is there anything appropriate, please inspect and approve, official Han Fuqu remove knock seal,"</p>

If it only levies taxes on foreign goods as a barrier to domestic products, the Chinese people should be happy to support it. However, the actual agricultural products entering Guangdong, except for soybeans, which are mostly from Shandong Province, are all produced in Central China and North China. Since Guangdong Province began levying the agricultural product special tax, it originally came from Shandong Province, so the name specifically refers to imported goods. Gradually, even those from other provinces in the country are also levied together. We are all in the same Chinese territory, the same Chinese nation, yet we still strongly divide territories and use provinces as boundaries. If other provinces reciprocate, those from Guangdong will also be heavily taxed. Then, domestic products will not be able to be sold domestically, let alone compete with foreigners. In recent years, foreign countries have competed to build tariff barriers to maintain their own farmers and merchants. I have never heard of turning the spear inward and heavily taxing their own goods. It is even more unheard of to levy taxes on daily necessities. The Guangdong Province's special tax on raw oil initially levied 1.5 yuan per dan, increased to 3.5 yuan this summer, and then changed to 4.5 yuan shortly after, plus 30% small ocean to over 7 yuan. At a time when the Guangdong price of daily necessities was 17 to 18 yuan, the tax was levied to 7 yuan, exceeding 40 percent, exceeding the customs tax on foreign luxury goods. Such harsh levies and heavy taxes are unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Shandong Province's production has always been dominated by red oil, and most of it is sold to Guangdong Province. In recent years, it has suffered this blow, making the already bankrupt rural areas more desolate, and the ten industry merchants who rely on the prosperity of the province's cities are also dying. When I think about the future, I can't bear to imagine it. Now I hear that raw cake and soybean cake are being taxed again, with an additional surcharge for the construction of Zhongda, levying 2.5 cents of ocean per dan, plus 30% small ocean to 3.25 cents. Manufacturers and factory workers in various ports have already gone on strike and stopped transportation because they cannot bear the heavy burden of taxation. Raw soybean cake is needed by farmers for field materials. It is absurd to talk about relieving the rural areas while adding to the burden on farmers. Moreover, foreign goods are taxed equally, which is no different from encouraging the import of Shandong soybean cake and putting our country's manufacturers to death. The previous telegram called for help for this reason. Now, foreign merchants are using the pretext of commercial treaties, and disregarding other harsh taxes beyond customs duties, have begun to transport red oil soybean cake,装付(装付 seems to mean sending payment/shipment?) Shantou Guangdong to sell, without paying the special tax, rising up to seize the position of our country's merchants and replace them. And I heard that a certain foreigner in Shantou has shipped and sold more than 100,000 bags of foreign rice, all without paying taxes other than customs duties. Other open transportation and smuggling are too numerous to mention. Rice merchants have gone bankrupt one after another as a result. The establishment of the special tax is simply a protection tax for foreign merchants. It leads wolves into the house and drives fish into the abyss. Our country's merchants are doomed to die without being able to complain. The Guangdong Provincial Government can do nothing about it. The tax revenue is still without landing, only giving a certain merchant the opportunity to make a fortune. The weak are the prey of the strong, and our industry will have no place. Our interests are closely related. I dare to ask you to exert justice, telegraph and call for help, so that the dying farmers and merchants can be relieved of their predicament. I am immensely grateful. Qingdao Guangbang Shen Antang kowtows."</p>
<h3>Guangdong Bank: After the Suspension of Business of Head and Branch Offices</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Head Office Returns Safe Deposit Box Contents; Guangdong Branches’ Creditors Establish Offices; Taishan Branch Also Declares Closure</p>
<p>Following the announcements of closure of business by the Guangzhou Communications and Hong Kong-Guangdong Banks, the process of liquidation is now underway. A detailed account of the situation is provided below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Head Office</p>
<p>After the Hong Kong Guangdong Bank Head Office announced its closure on the fourth of this month, the bank’s board of directors submitted a request to the Hong Kong Court (as the bank is registered with the Hong Kong government) for the Hong Kong government to dispatch auditors to the bank to verify the accounts. The Hong Kong Chief Justice approved the request, sending Mr. Xue Fu on the fifth to supervise the proceedings. According to bank employees, the bank has substantial assets, including six branches located in San Francisco (USA), Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shantou, Taishan, and Siam. The premises of each branch are owned by the bank. The Hong Kong head office building is valued at over 1.2 million yuan, and the other five branch buildings are also of considerable value. The bank owns over sixty buildings in Hong Kong. In Guangzhou, there is a farm valued at over 600,000 yuan. Additionally, there are many mortgaged properties. However, these assets could not be readily converted into cash, leading to financial difficulties and the eventual closure. As of the end of last year, the liquid assets amounted to over 13 million yuan. However, since the beginning of this year, many overseas Chinese have become unemployed and returned to China. A large portion of the bank's deposits came from overseas Chinese. As these people returned home with nothing but themselves, they rushed to withdraw their savings. In the past six months, more than half of the bank's deposits have been withdrawn. The remaining funds were transferred by the bank to other investments, which are difficult to recover in the short term. As a result, the bank faced severe financial strain. After the closure on the fourth of this month, those handling the aftermath began returning the contents of safe deposit boxes on the fifth. The Hong Kong government appointed a special administrator to announce the hours for accessing the boxes, which were from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily. Due to the large crowds of people seeking access, it was decided to limit entry to groups of four, with each group having twenty minutes to retrieve their belongings. Police were stationed inside and outside to maintain order. Those retrieving items from the safe deposit boxes were required to bring their keys and sign for the items. The signatures and seals were checked against the records to ensure they matched. After completing all the procedures, bank staff escorted the customers into the vault to retrieve their stored items. The majority of the stored items were valuable jewelry, gemstones, and property deeds. The bank had a total of 1,300 safe deposit boxes rented out. On the first day, 214 people retrieved their stored items.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Branch</p>
<p>Following the closure of the Guangzhou branch, the remaining assets, excluding movables, include approximately 200,000 yuan in Guangdong provincial silver certificates, promissory notes worth approximately 110,000 yuan, and about 40,000 yuan in Hong Kong currency. The Finance Department, recognizing the impact of the branch's closure on the local financial market, immediately dispatched personnel to seal the bank's vaults and strongboxes. On the morning of the sixth, Mr. Chen, a special commissioner, was sent to the bank to oversee the custody of the assets, pending supervision and liquidation. Simultaneously, a senior official from the Public Security Bureau was stationed at the bank to assist with security matters. A notice from the Finance Department was posted in front of the branch, stating: "It was reported yesterday morning that the Guangdong Bank, located on Xidi, had collapsed. This department immediately dispatched Commissioners Zhao Zhuo, Liu Buchi, and Cheng Wanyang to the bank to supervise the liquidation. They reported back that they had notified the Taiping Public Security Bureau, and together with Bureau members Xu Tingzhang, Huang Peiran, and Yan Sheng, they inspected the bank. Upon arrival, they found the doors tightly closed, with armed police from the Taiping branch guarding the gates and a notice from the bank posted. Armed police were also guarding the back door. Bureau member Xu led them inside, where they found the building deserted. All the large and small warehouses and safes were locked. Zheng Guohua, the police officer on duty at the bank, stated that the bank had operated as usual yesterday and that only a junior employee had stayed overnight. No one had returned to the bank to open for business this morning. After consultation, they returned to the department to request seals for processing. In addition to sealing the three large and small warehouses and the two large and small safes with the issued seals, along with Taiping Branch member Huang Peiran, they submitted a report to the authorities for review. The Finance Department has deemed it necessary to dispatch personnel to guard all warehouses and assets of the bank, to ensure security. In addition to ordering the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Bureau to each dispatch a member to be stationed permanently at the bank to jointly guard the premises, and awaiting supervision and liquidation, this notice is hereby issued for public information." The Finance Department has also stipulated that the period from the sixth to the sixteenth of this month is designated as the registration period for creditors of the branch. The creditors have also hired lawyers to organize a creditors' office and have notified creditors to register at the temporary creditors' office at No. 414, Yide Road, 4th floor, to facilitate the handling of the case.</p>
<p>Taishan Branch</p>
<p>The Guangdong Bank Taishan branch was established in January of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). It built its premises on Xima Road in Taicheng, with the building valued at approximately 30,000 yuan. The manager was Li Pingzhai. The business was considered prosperous, with deposits of approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. However, starting this year, there have been numerous withdrawals. Upon receipt of instructions from the head office, it also announced its closure on the fourth of this month.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Another Robbery of a Jia Head in the Eighth District</p>
<p>Zhang Daosheng, the Jia Head (local administrative leader) of the fifth Jia in the fourth Bao of Hutang Township, Eighth District of this county, lived modestly and was able to make a living. Unexpectedly, on the night of the twelfth, thirteen bandits speaking with a local accent, each armed with pistols and rifles, broke through the bamboo curtain and ransacked the house. The robbery lasted for over an hour. The bandits then left the same way they came, with the leader ordering each bandit to stand in line and calling out their names before they fled. Their calm and unhurried manner was appalling. It is reported that over twenty yuan in silver and clothing and cloth were stolen. The case has been reported to the Fifth Sub-Precinct for investigation.</p>
<p>Nanhui</p>
<p>Tax Police Indiscriminately Arrest Merchants and Civilians, Leading to Disputes</p>
<p>The case of the salt vendors resisting arrest in Waizao has been previously reported in this newspaper. Further details are provided below. Zhao Jinmei, a salt vendor from Shipile, Eighth District, went to Panchunyuan in Waizao on the sixth to have tea. Tax police were present. Zhao quickly left but was spotted by tax police Zhang Chuanjin and others, who followed and tied Zhao up, intending to escort him to the team headquarters to the west. Zhao resisted, and others helped Zhao to escape. The tax police fought back but were outnumbered, and two rifles were seized and one broken. Both sides sustained injuries. The next day, a large number of tax police arrived and arrested five people at the home of Pan Alan, who were mud carriers and carpenters working for the Pan family. None of them were involved in the resistance. Subsequently, four more people, including Wu Jintao, were arrested. Except for the mother of Wu Xianglong, who was known to have dealings with salt vendors, the others were innocent. Most shockingly, the wife of Xu Jiajie, the township head of Shuyuan Township, was also arrested, and an old box cannon and one rifle belonging to the local watch were seized. For several days, people were arrested everywhere. Anyone with some wealth was implicated, and others temporarily fled. Given this situation, the merchants and civilians of Waierzhao and Lierzao Towns were living in fear, and a general strike was called. Upon receiving the report, the county government dispatched Zhang, the head of the First District, to Waierzhao on the seventeenth to appease the public. At the same time, an urgent telegram was sent to Xie, the head of the Seventh District, to work with Wen She, the head of the tax police district stationed in Xinchang, to return the firearms, release the villagers, and withdraw the troops from Waierzhao. The district assistant immediately dispatched personnel to stop the arrests.</p>

<p>Tang Guisheng's Ferry Boat Robbed</p>
<p>The Tang Guisheng ferry boat, which operates between Songjigang and Erjia Town, was robbed yesterday (the fifteenth) afternoon. As the boat was travelling from Songjigang to Erjia Town, near Qin Shangyi's tofu shop in Tongji Township, Second District, three bandits were waiting on the shore. They produced pistols and ordered the boat to stop and come alongside. The bandits jumped on board, ordering everyone to remain silent, and proceeded to rob the passengers of their silver and valuables. The total loss is estimated at over 500 yuan. Afterwards, the boat owner, Tang Guisheng, reported the incident to the Songjigang Public Security Police Station, which dispatched police to investigate. The bandits have disappeared.</p>
<p>Armed Conflict in Wangyang Village Intensifies</p>
<p>Sha Ruiqing, Niu Zhuqiao, Zhang Dianrong and other landowners of Tangtian No. 18, Wangyang Village, Sixth District, have been in a property dispute with Lu Yuren and others for many years, but it remains unresolved. Yesterday (the sixteenth), Zhang Dianrong led tenants Shi Guanrong, Cui Zhiyuan, and twenty others to pick cotton. Lu Yuren's wife, seeing this, gathered over one hundred thugs, including Huang Xiao and Guo Caiqi, each armed with knives and sticks, and rushed into the field, indiscriminately beating the tenants. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the tenants fled. Shi Guanrong and Cui Zhiyuan sustained severe knife wounds to their arms and other parts of their bodies. Zhang Dianrong was unable to escape and was abducted. On the morning of the seventeenth, Sha Ruiqing and others brought the injured tenants Shi Guanrong and Cui Zhiyuan to the county government for examination and requested that police be dispatched to rescue Zhang Dianrong.</p>

<p>Plans to Dredge Eight Major Rivers</p>
<p>This county has been ordered to conscript labor to dredge rivers. The Construction Bureau has finalized plans to prioritize the dredging of eight major rivers: Panjiagang, Henghe, Houshuhe, Zhangjingqiao Main River, Canhuahe, Sijinghe, Xuchongqiao Port, and Luquqiao West River. The total length to be dredged is over eleven kilometers. As it is already September, in accordance with the provincial implementation schedule, it is imperative to conduct surveys and commence preparations. On the eighteenth, the county government instructed each district head to promptly conduct a detailed survey of the rivers within their district that are silted up and hindering water conservancy and transportation, complete the forms, and submit them to the county for review, so that work can begin as soon as possible.</p>

The decision was unanimously approved. (2) How to appoint the managers of the collection and lease of various assets settled by this association.

<p>Silk Industry Bank Establishes Branch</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, recently in response to a letter from the Shanghai Silk Industry Association, recognized Shengze as an area of agriculture and industry, with numerous silkworm farmers and weaving households. It has always been a silk-producing area, but lacks financial institutions to balance surpluses and deficits. Those in the silk industry who come to the area to purchase products, as well as local businesses, deeply feel the lack of a specialized bank to provide financial support, hindering development. To meet these needs, the bank has established a branch in Shengze, in order to implement the bank's consistent purpose of supporting the silk industry. All preparations have reportedly been completed. The location has been determined to be the old site of Tiancheng Chang on Huayuan Street. The manager has been appointed by the head office as Mr. Shen Baocha. The opening is scheduled for September 26.</p>

While passing outside the West Gate, they were suddenly accosted by two bandits, one holding a pistol and the other empty-handed. They threatened them into silence, and all 500 yuan in silver was robbed. Zhou wanted to commit suicide by drowning, but was dissuaded by passers-by. He immediately reported the incident to the county government, requesting the arrest and prosecution of the bandits. Also, Ni, a boatman, transported over thirty piculs of wheat to You, which was sold on his behalf by Zhang Jiufeng Grain Store, earning 194 yuan in silver. On the morning of the fifteenth, he returned north. While passing near the Jiulong Temple, they suddenly encountered six bandits, who ordered them to stop and come ashore.

<p>The Situation of New Cotton Entering the Market in Tongzhou</p>
<p>The counties under Tongzhou and the coastal reclamation areas have had a bumper harvest of new cotton this year. The total production is estimated to be 1.5 million piculs of ginned cotton. It has now entered the market. Cotton merchants from both local and outside areas have set up shops in the countryside to purchase cotton. The financial sector is also showing signs of activity. The Finance Department, recognizing that the business tax on cotton in Tong is substantial, has specially appointed Wang Maoqing to be stationed in Tong to supervise the collection and has set up checkpoints on key waterways within the territory for inspection.</p>

The Public Security Bureau investigated and dismissed him, transferring him to the court for investigation. After investigation by the prosecutor, a public prosecution was initiated on the grounds of obstructing public morals. Subsequently, the criminal court judge repeatedly summoned witnesses and held hearings. Wang Huili consistently denied the rape and any indecent behavior. Judge Zhao, in order to conduct a detailed review, specially sent Wang Huili to the hospital for examination to determine if he had gonorrhea and then re-examined the case. On the eighteenth, the case was finally announced. Wang Huili was sentenced to two years and four months imprisonment in accordance with Article 124 of the Criminal Law for engaging in lewd acts with a girl under the age of fourteen. Upon the expiration of the appeal period, he will be sent to prison.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Levying a Surtax to Dredge the Oujiang River</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department, based on a report from the Yongjia County Magistrate, cited a letter from the Third Special District Zhun Ouhai Supervisory Office regarding the dredging of the Oujiang River. The fee of 1,600 yuan has been raised locally by the county. However, the dredging funds require approval from the Finance Department to levy a surtax on imported goods, following the example of Tianjin and Shanghai. Upon order, the Oujiang River is indeed blocked, and if it is necessary to levy a surtax through customs as dredging funds, a detailed plan for dredging the river and the total cost of expenses should be drafted. Estimate the amount of tax revenue in the near two years of the customs office and estimate which tax rate and how many months it will take to meet the expenses. The Water Conservancy Bureau has been ordered to conduct surveys and measurements as soon as possible. Before the completion, a preliminary budget of estimated expenses will be reviewed and transferred.</p>
<p>Improved Cotton Begins Harvesting</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department Agricultural Management Committee this year advanced and sold improved cotton on 150,000 mu of land. Harvesting has now begun everywhere. The price is between ten and eleven yuan per dan (unit of weight). In Hang County, it is purchased by Yi You Spinning Factory. In Xiao, it is purchased by the cooperative with loans from the Shanghai Commercial Bank. In Yuyao, it is purchased by the committee with loans from the Bank of Communications. In Haiyan, it is purchased with loans from the Zhejiang Local Bank. In Dinghai, Cixi, and Fenghua, it is purchased by He Feng Spinning Factory. In Zhenhai, it is purchased by cotton merchants. Contracts have been signed. The Construction Department has also sent Feng Zhaochuan, the deputy director of the Cotton Industry Office, to Shanghai to discuss matters related to selling the cotton. A sales office will be set up in Shanghai to facilitate sales. The location is attached to the Raw Silk Sales Association.</p>
<p>The Guanghua Factory Labor Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Guanghua Match Company, after merging with the Shanghai Dachunghua Company, experienced sluggish sales and reduced labor once. Recently, downsizing was implemented and another reduction in labor was planned, reducing each worker from 31 carts to 24 carts. The workers, due to livelihood concerns, went on strike on the sixteenth, with thousands of male and female workers demanding the restoration of the original state. (At 1:00 PM on the seventeenth, the Hangzhou Municipal Government convened representatives from both labor and management for mediation. After compromise by the mayor Zhou Xiangxian and the social section chief Wu, both parties made concessions, reducing from 32 carts to 28 carts, and a satisfactory resolution was reached. Work resumed as usual.</p>
<p>Weather Affects Fresh Cocoon Price Drop</p>
<p>The silkworms in the counties of Zhejiang Province have successively been put on the frames to spin cocoons. The 116 cocoon merchants have also started their business. However, due to the sudden cold weather in recent days, the cocoon bodies have inevitably been affected, and the price of fresh cocoons has decreased. The standard price is about 20 yuan. The Silk Association borrowed 600,000 yuan from the banking sector, and 200,000 yuan has been used to distribute to silk reeling factories in various districts to purchase fresh cocoons. Silk and cocoon merchants are raising funds to purchase cocoons.</p>

<h3>The City's Smoking Ban Issue - Wang Dasui Broadcasts a Speech on Behalf of Cai Jingjun</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Bureau of Education invited Police Chief Cai Jingjun yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM to deliver a speech on the city's smoking ban issue at the Sino-Western Broadcasting Station. As Cai was unable to attend due to official business, he specially dispatched Director Wang Dasui of the Bureau to represent him in broadcasting the following speech:</p>
<p>Tracing the Origin of the Disaster: Today, I am instructed by Chief Cai of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to speak on the issue of the smoking ban. Chief Cai has already spoken on this issue last month. Today, I will supplement it. Before discussing the smoking ban, we must first understand the origin of opium. Opium is originally produced in India. It was transported to China during the Xianfeng era of the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the people of the whole country did not know the harm of opium and regarded it as a form of recreation. This situation caused countless of our compatriots to suffer from an addiction they could not break. By the Daoguang era, opium had unintentionally spread throughout the country, and the import of opium increased day by day. Statistics show that more than 30,000 boxes of opium were imported at that time, worth more than 20 million taels of silver. However, when opium was spreading throughout the country, people with foresight knew the harm of smoking. In the nineteenth year of Daoguang, Lin Zexu was ordered to go to Guangdong to ban smoking, arrest opium merchants, and confiscate property. Because his actions were too drastic, he failed and triggered the Opium War. Since then, the import of opium has increased year by year, the outflow of money has been countless, and the loss of rights and the impact on the national economy are beyond description.</p>
<p>The Poison Spreads Domestically</p>
<p>Looking back at the situation of opium poisoning in our country in the past, anyone who has been to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou knows that six or seven tenths of the farmland in these provinces was used to grow opium. Other provinces also had similar situations in the past, but not as severe. As a result, the production of opium was high, the production of rice was low, and famines occurred frequently. We know that the lack of food and the increase of opium addicts are bound to create social unrest. If we continue like this and do not ban smoking as soon as possible, we will simply lead the country to its doom day by day.</p>
<p>The Number of Opium Offenders Increases Daily</p>
<p>Let's examine the facts. Let's make a comparison based on the statistics of opium offenders arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. In the 21st year, 3,500 opium offenders were arrested. In the 22nd year, the number of opium offenders increased to 6,276. In the 23rd year, the number of opium offenders increased again to 6,956. From this, it seems that the number of opium offenders is increasing year by year. The number of consumers is increasing day by day, and the number of producers is decreasing day by day. At the same time, so many of our compatriots are living in a state of intoxication and delusion, which will naturally affect the health of the entire nation and create a backward economic state. In short, in the past hundred years, all the loss of national rights, economic backwardness, the decline of people's livelihood, and the bankruptcy of rural areas were all caused by opium. Opium has caused the entire country and nation to fall apart.</p>
<p>Determination to Eradicate</p>
<p>People with vision know that the poison of opium is enough to destroy our country and exterminate our race. Since Lin Zexu's implementation of the smoking ban failed, whether it was the Qing government or the Northern Warlords, they continued to ban smoking. But why has the smoking ban not been eradicated until now? There are two main reasons why it cannot be eradicated: (1) The government does not have the determination to thoroughly eradicate smoking. (2) The government does not have practical methods to ban smoking. Because in the past, the smoking ban only had provisions for punishing opium addicts, but there were no fundamental methods to eradicate opium seedlings and ban planting and smoking in stages. Therefore, the production of opium has increased year by year, and the number of opium smokers has also increased year by year. Now, our Director Jiang Jichang is determined to ban smoking from the root and has adopted the six-year opium eradication plan resolved by the National Assembly in the past, deciding that from this year to the 29th year, the period for eradicating opium. In addition to strictly formulating regulations and banning planting in stages, two of the most effective methods are adopted to prohibit opium smoking, one is to promote the New Life Movement to change social customs, encourage the public, and assist the government in banning smoking, and the other is to use scientific methods, under the principles of extreme peace and extreme systematicness, to enable opium addicts to quit opium addiction in stages. The city has been following the government's smoking ban plan and has already started registration at the end of July. From July to the end of September is the voluntary registration period. During this period, people are allowed to voluntarily surrender to quit or obtain licenses. From October to the end of October is the compulsory registration period. During this period, arrests of private smokers will begin, and fines will be imposed according to law. After that, they will be ordered to register.</p>
<p>Steps to Ban Smoking</p>
<p>Now, I will report the steps to ban opium in the city to everyone. The city's opium eradication period follows the government's plan and is set at six years, from this year to the 29th year. The six years are divided into stages to ban smoking. The steps are as follows: (1) From July to December of the 24th year, register opium addicts and issue licenses for quitting opium within a time limit. (2) In the 25th year, licenses for quitting opium within a time limit will no longer be issued. All registered opium addicts must have at least one-fifth of the total number who have quit. Those who have not quit will be issued new licenses. (3) In the 26th year, registered opium addicts who have obtained licenses must have at least two-fifths of the total number who have quit. Those who have not quit will be issued new licenses. (4) In the 27th year, registered opium addicts who have obtained licenses must have at least two-fifths of the total number who have quit. Those who have not quit will be issued new licenses. (5) In the 28th year, registered opium addicts who have obtained licenses must have at least four-fifths of the total number who have quit. Those who have not quit will be issued new licenses. (6) In the 29th year, all registered opium addicts must quit, and the licenses for quitting will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Registration Procedures</p>
<p>As for the registration procedures, those applying for ordinary opium quitting licenses should first fill out a registration application form, and the bureau will issue licenses based on the form. Those applying for poor people's licenses, in addition to filling out the application form, should also submit a letter of guarantee, which will be investigated by the bureau before issuing the poor people's licenses. Those requesting to quit smoking must also fill out the application form and letter of guarantee according to the regulations. After investigation, they will be sent to the opium quitting hospital for free treatment. In consideration of the difficulty for opium addicts to find guarantors, the bureau stipulates that the qualifications of the guarantor should be any friend or relative of the opium addict with a confirmed address and a proper occupation. There is no need to seek a shop guarantor. The guarantor for obtaining a poor people's opium quitting license only needs to guarantee that the opium addict is not falsely claiming to be a poor person. The guarantor for requesting to quit opium only needs to guarantee that the opium addict will not deliberately evade when the bureau sends him for periodic verification after quitting and being released, and there is no other responsibility. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about acting as a guarantor for an opium addict.</p>
<p>Issuance of Licenses</p>
<p>During the registration period, all police officers of the bureau will serve opium addicts. Opium addicts can apply for registration at any time, whether they go to the bureau or any of its branches, police stations, or substations. Any questions from opium addicts will be answered in detail. It is now stipulated that this month is the date for the first issuance of opium quitting licenses. All procedures have been fully prepared, and licenses will be filled out and delivered by police officers to each household immediately. In short, the bureau's registration procedures are as simple as possible, and all measures are taken in the interests of opium addicts. Opium addicts can go ahead and apply for registration and do not need to have any doubts.</p>
<p>Establishment of Hospitals for Quitting Opium</p>
<p>As for the city's opium quitting program, thanks to the efforts of the Health Bureau, several hospitals have been established, including the Hubei Opium Quitting Hospital, the Hunan Opium Quitting Hospital, and the Criminal Opium Quitting Hospital. They are well-equipped and offer excellent treatment. Opium addicts can quit opium completely free of charge. The quitting period is at least twenty days, and up to fifty or sixty days. They will not be allowed to leave the hospital until they have quit. Recently, opium addicts who have obtained licenses in other provinces and cities have often come to the city to request to quit opium, and the bureau has allowed them to be sent for quitting. As for opium addicts in the city who reside in the Special Zone, as long as the registration procedures are complete, they will also be sent for quitting. However, the registration period is now limited, and opium addicts who are determined to quit cannot delay any longer.</p>
<p>House-to-House Persuasion</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to register opium addicts, Chief Cai of the bureau believes that this matter is important to the future of national revival and is determined to implement it thoroughly. He has already explained the reasons in a broadcast last month. Registration can determine the future of the smoking ban. Now the registration period has been over a month and a half. It has been found that there are 10,014 opium addicts, of which about 2,000 have already registered. The bureau has persuaded all unregistered opium addicts to come to register voluntarily from house to house. During this voluntary period, the bureau is always lenient and prioritizes the interests of opium addicts. However, according to the bureau's investigation, some opium addicts still misunderstand the law and voluntarily abandon themselves. Some opium addicts found by the bureau do not dare to register voluntarily, and others are unwilling to register. Opium addicts are delaying and thinking that they can get by for a while, but undoubtedly, they will eventually fall into the legal net and regret it too late. Because the smoking ban plan is consistent throughout the country, after the six-month registration period expires, registration will be stopped throughout the country. Since the 25th year, the bureau will stop issuing opium quitting licenses to opium offenders arrested and will send them for persuasion and quitting after punishing them according to law. This is the case in the city, and it is the same in other provinces. People who smoke opium, if they do not take this opportunity to register according to the regulations, will have no place to settle down even if they travel all over the country.</p>
<p>Should Awaken Quickly</p>
<p>People who smoke opium, you should know that opium is extremely harmful to individuals, nations, and countries. If you do not thoroughly quit, not only will you live in perpetual poverty and sacrifice your entire career, but the country and nation will also be directly and indirectly harmed. You should also know that quitting opium can improve your status, so that you are not looked down upon, you can restore your health, you can save money, you can benefit your family, and it can lead you to a bright and happy path. People who are too addicted to opium and cannot quit immediately should also know that "registration" is a kind and righteous measure devised by the government with "great effort" and should be strictly followed. Otherwise, you will be severely punished.</p>
<p>No Regret for Change</p>
<p>The date for voluntary registration is coming to an end. The last day of September will be the beginning of the compulsory period, which is the period when the government uses legal means to enforce registration. During this period, the bureau will begin to arrest opium addicts. Regarding the enforcement of arrest work, the bureau will of course take consistent action with the police agencies of the Special Zone. Especially at land and water traffic ports, travelers will be strictly inspected. People who smoke opium can be recognized at a glance from their appearance. Even if they refuse to admit that they smoke, they will not be able to hide it once they are investigated, and there is no way to avoid it. Citizens, you must fundamentally understand that the smoking ban and registration are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Registration is going upward, and not registering is voluntarily sinking downward. Registration is abiding by the law, and not registering is voluntarily falling into the legal net. People who do not smoke should unanimously assist the government, persuade opium addicts, and register as soon as possible. People who smoke opium should go to the Public Security Bureau to register voluntarily as soon as possible. In particular, landlords should persuade the opium addicts in their households to register voluntarily. The significance of my speech today is to hope that all citizens will understand the government's painstaking efforts to strictly ban smoking and change social customs, recognize the current seriousness of the smoking ban, and unite to assist the government in implementing the smoking ban and reviving the Chinese nation.

The section was announced yesterday to be established and Dai Lizhen was appointed as the section head. Under the section are four units: licensing, anti-smuggling, registration, and persuasion.

However, the disaster situation in Hunan is also extremely serious. Now, a report has been received from Gao Fengxiang, the Prefecture Apostolic of Yuezhou, which is transcribed as follows: (Omitted above) "The severity of the Hunan disaster is unprecedented. Alas, Yueyang, Pingjiang, Linxiang, and Huarong, four counties, have suffered from banditry, war, epidemics, and drought throughout the year. The people's crops have all been destroyed, and the government officials are helpless. Unexpectedly, this summer, there has been continuous rain and flooding, drowning countless people and livestock. The cries of sorrow are everywhere, and corpses line the roads. Under the overturned nests, the refugees are scattered and starving. Fengxiang and others, as missionaries in this land, are heartbroken by what they see and cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, they have raised donations, but they have already exhausted their strength and voice. However, urgent relief is not easy, and post-disaster recovery is even more difficult. Taking both into consideration, in addition to sending telegrams to appeal for help, we respectfully ask you to remember the Hunan disaster and provide extraordinary assistance to save the remaining people."</p>

<h3>Former Director of the Fujian Opium Suppression Office Accused of Seduction, Abandonment, Abuse, and Illegal Imprisonment; Yang Tianyu Sued by Ms. He Xiuwen; Defendant Admits to Prohibiting Plaintiff from Leaving Her Hometown—Trial Concluded Yesterday, Judgment Scheduled for the 20th</h3>
<p>Yang Tianyu, formerly the Director of the Fujian Opium Suppression Office, also known as Menglin, a native of Fujian, was recently sued by He Xiuwen, a 21-year-old woman from Wuhu, who hired lawyer Feng Shuhua to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing him of seduction, abandonment, abuse, and illegal imprisonment, and attaching a civil lawsuit demanding a judgment ordering him to pay alimony of 13,400 yuan, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui of the Eighth Criminal Division summoned the defendant Yang Tianyu, who also arrived in court with his defense attorney. The plaintiff, He Xiuwen, stated that in September of the previous year, when she was 19 years old, a woman named Li introduced her to the defendant under the pretext of visiting the French Park. Later, she was seduced and falsely told that he had no wife at home and wanted to marry her. However, she had already been betrothed to someone by her parents. But the defendant seduced her in every possible way, causing her to fall into his trap. She was repeatedly seduced to various hotels and had physical relations with him. In September, the defendant sent her back to her hometown to complete the divorce procedures with her fiancé. With relatives and friends as witnesses, she terminated the engagement, compensated the man for his losses, and signed a document. In November, the defendant went to Hankou to seek employment and sent someone to invite her to go to Hankou with him, staying at the Yangtze River Hotel for about two weeks. Because his employment failed, they returned to Shanghai together. In the spring of last year, they opened a Xinyuanzhai candy store at 143 Shanhai Pass Road. The defendant went to Fuzhou to work in the military. Later, because the candy store she opened suffered losses and closed down, and she had financial difficulties, she took a boat to Fuzhou to urge him to marry her. But the defendant kept prevaricating. Later, she found out that the defendant had a wife surnamed Ying and had recently taken a concubine surnamed Lin, and spent 7,000 foreign dollars to buy a house to hide her. At this point, she realized that she had been seduced by the defendant and had made a mistake that could not be undone. She tried to negotiate with him, but the defendant relied on his power to bully her and sent a servant named Yang Yulai to forcibly take her to the Baishui Temple in Xiamen, in the defendant's hometown. He sent Yang to guard her, prohibiting her from moving freely. The letters she received from her parents were also confiscated, and she was treated like a criminal. It was not until the 18th of last month that she was able to escape from her cage thanks to Yang Yulai's awakening of conscience and flee to Shanghai. But the defendant was still unwilling and intended to use his old tricks to trick her back to her hometown. Fortunately, she was not fooled. On the one hand, the defendant was angry with Yang Yulai and sent him a letter of severe reprimand, which was detrimental to Yang. The defendant's behavior has violated the criminal law, so she has filed this lawsuit and requests that he be punished. When questioned, the defendant Yang Tianyu testified that in the previous year, when he lived at 19 Hualun Lane, Hualun Road, in the French Concession, Li Xiaomei, the maid hired by a tenant, introduced him to a fellow villager (i.e., the plaintiff), saying that she was poor and willing to be a concubine, and was currently a maid in a certain family, earning four yuan a month. He asked Li Xiaomei to take him to meet the plaintiff, and they agreed to meet in the French Park the next day. They talked with each other and were quite congenial, so he took her as a concubine and gave her 800 yuan for her parents to open a candy store, living together at 143 Shanhai Pass Road. There was no secret rendezvous in any hotel beforehand. Later, because he had no job and the expenses in Shanghai were huge, he persuaded the plaintiff to return to his hometown to live with his family, Yang Yulai, while he went to Nanjing to seek employment. But the plaintiff soon wanted to leave her hometown. He repeatedly wrote to persuade her, but received no reply. He was so angry that he wrote to Yang Yulai, ordering him not to allow the plaintiff to leave her hometown, etc. Judge Liu verified the testimony and instructed the lawyers for both parties to argue. He then announced that the judgment in this case would be pronounced at 10:00 AM on the 20th. He adjourned the court, and it was already 12:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The Sun Shancheng Kidnapping Case: Continued Arrest of Key Mastermind, Along with Yu Tangshi and Wang Tangshi</h3>
<p>Sun Shancheng, the nine-year-old son of Sun Cailing, a Ningbo native and current manager of the Hankou Agricultural and Industrial Bank, residing at No. 50, Beilege Changxing Lane in the French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits who demanded a ransom of 500,000 yuan. The kidnapping was reported to the police and a request for arrest warrants was issued.  The French police discovered that the kidnappers were hiding in Hangzhou and dispatched detectives to Hangzhou, arresting the kidnapper, Wang Baorui, and bringing him back to Shanghai for investigation. Details of this were already published in this newspaper. It has now been learned that the idea for this case originated with Shi Xushi, a female servant in the victim's household, and her fellow villager, Yu Tangshi, who colluded with the bandits to seize the opportunity to kidnap Shancheng. The kidnapper, Wang Baorui, is Yu Tangshi's brother-in-law and was hiding on the upper floor of the Jinzhi Zima Lane No. 3 Hotel in Hangzhou. He was arrested along with them. Yu Tangshi's sister, Wang Tangshi, is currently being detained at the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, it is said.</p>
<p>Discovery of Unauthorized Passengers on the "Hai'an" Steamer... Head Seaman Dismissed... Crew Members Given Demerits</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's "Hai'an" is the only liner operating between Shanghai and Wenzhou, and passenger traffic and freight volumes are very high. The ship's stoker foreman had a long-standing bad habit of carrying "yellow fish" on board, meaning secretly selling tickets to passengers without the knowledge of the ship's owners. The China Merchants Bureau has been strictly cracking down on this type of embezzlement in recent years. Recently, the Bureau received a tip that the "Hai'an" ship's stoker foreman, a certain Che, was carrying unauthorized passengers on each voyage. General Manager Liu Hongsheng sent personnel to the ship to conduct a thorough investigation, and they discovered a secret passenger cabin set up by the stoker foreman, capable of accommodating four passengers. With clear evidence of this, the stoker foreman was immediately dismissed. The ship's officers were also at fault for failing to notice, and the chief mate, Fang Gencai, and the purser, Cao Xiaoqiu, were each given a demerit. At the same time, orders were issued to all ships to notify all crew members and stoker foremen to strictly observe the rules.</p>
<p>One Knife Stabbed a Person to Death: Xiao Yougen Died Tragically; Shen Taikui is on the Run</p>
<p>Xiao Yougen, also known as "Baldy," a native of Nantong, was 33 years old. He used to make a living rowing boats on the Huangpu River and was well-known among his peers. He had recently abandoned his trade and become a loafer for several years. Having Zhou, who has an official job, as his boss, he was naturally domineering and relied on his evil influence to bully his fellow tradesmen, thus creating many enemies. Recently, Shen Dakui, another member of the same group, who also has Fan as his boss, wanted to borrow two yuan from a certain Jia (these people call it "opening a credit line"). Xiao learned of this and stepped in to prevent it, preventing Jia from paying.  Shen, unable to get the money, harbored a grudge against Xiao and plotted revenge. On the 16th, at midnight, he hid a sharp knife and waited for Xiao on the Chinese territory across from Fujian Road, north of the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession. When Xiao passed by, he unexpectedly stabbed Xiao once in the left leg with the knife, causing profuse bleeding. The assailant immediately turned and fled. After being injured, Xiao dragged himself to the gate of No. 1 Minhang Road in the French Concession, but collapsed to the ground due to the pain. Patrolman No. 552 discovered him and reported it to the police station. Detectives rushed to investigate. Xiao identified the assailant and requested his arrest. The detectives then sent him to Guangci Hospital. Due to excessive blood loss, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 1:30 AM that night. The hospital notified the police station to move the body to the morgue. As there was no way to identify the body, only the witness, Qian Yougen, was summoned to the station. The next day, a report was submitted to the Special Second Court. Prosecutor Wang, accompanied by a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the morgue and confirmed that the deceased had died from a knife wound sustained before death. After questioning the witness, he ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for encoffining and burial, and instructed the police to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice for questioning.</p>
<p>Airlines Send Special Plane to Distribute Air Ticket Flyers</p>

It is learned that China National Aviation Corporation has specially dispatched a plane on September 19th to carry flyers and distribute them to various ports to arouse public attention.

<p>Liu Tiqing Accused of Ignoring Land Mortgage Payments Totaling Over 1.5 Million National Currency; Court Hearing Completed, Sentence to be Announced</p>
<p>The property in Hongren Lane on Nanjing Road has long been owned by the wealthy merchant Liu Tiqing. The land is located in the most prosperous area of the city and its value is unparalleled. The property covers 8 mu, 8 fen, 7 li, and 5 hao. In October of the 13th year of the Republic [1924], Liu mortgaged it to a wealthy British merchant, Resider, for 500,000 taels of silver for a term of three years, with an annual interest rate of 8.5 percent. Shortly after, Resider passed away, and all of Resider's assets in Shanghai were placed under the management of a custodial committee organized by British citizen Maurice and others, appointed by the British official stationed in Shanghai. When Liu's mortgage reached its repayment date in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], Liu was unable to repay it and negotiated an extension with Maurice. Not only was Liu unable to repay the loan, but he also increased the mortgage by 600,000 taels of silver with Maurice. At that time, real estate prices in Shanghai were still rising, and it was estimated that the collateral was worth 1.9 million taels, so Maurice agreed to Liu's request and increased the mortgage, combining the previous amount to 1.1 million taels, with an annual interest rate of 9 percent, and a repayment date of October of last year. Liu also had Lu Shaotang guarantee the timely payment of interest. Unexpectedly, when the deadline arrived, Liu did not fulfill his redemption agreement, and had been in arrears with interest payments since January of this year. However, the current value of real estate is gradually declining, which is inversely proportional to the situation a few years ago. According to real estate experts, Liu's property in Hongren Lane is still worth more than 1.7 million yuan, but it is not easy to find a buyer. Liu's debt to Maurice, recently converted to national currency, amounts to 1,538,461.54 yuan. Xu Shihao and Rong Zhenlong, two lawyers, have filed a lawsuit against Liu with the First Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to repay the mortgage, advanced land rent, and outstanding interest, and requesting confirmation that the plaintiff has a priority right to compensation from the collateral and its buildings. Before the defendant makes full payment, the plaintiff should be allowed to collect rent from the tenants at that location. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen opened the court to summon the defendant, who also retained lawyer Jiang Baoli for defense. After reviewing the mortgage contract and clarifying the facts of the mortgage, the court adjourned to schedule a sentencing date.</p>
<p>Key Suspect in the Scheme to Illegally Issue Promissory Notes, Ou Rengwu, Arrested; Police Hope Victims Will Report; Le Baochai and Others Released</p>
<p>The Zhenhua Silver Company, located at No. 444 Broadway, was opened by Zhang Zhengdao with a capital of over 4,000 yuan, but the amount of promissory notes issued reached over 50,000 yuan. These promissory notes were all handed over by Zhang to others to fraudulently obtain goods from various shops, which were then converted into cash for personal use. When the promissory notes matured, they could not be cashed. On the 6th of this month, Zhenhua declared bankruptcy. As a result, various creditors reported to the Hongkou Police Station. Hua detectives Bao Shuji and Mao Yunlong, and the bookkeeper, Zhu Shaoshan, and involved persons Le Baochai, Bai Yongsheng, Xu Kangling, Fang Yongtai, and others were successively arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Details of this were already published in this newspaper. During his court hearing, Zhang confessed that the scheme to defraud goods was entirely instigated by a certain Ou Rengwu, and that Ou had taken away promissory notes worth 2,240 yuan. The police then requested the court to issue a warrant for Ou's arrest. The day before yesterday, Zhang Zhengdao's wife brought Ou to the Hongkou Police Station, where he was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, all the defendants were sent to the Fifth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted Zhang Zhengdao, Zhu Shaoshan, and Ou Rengwu for the crime of habitual fraud under Article 340 of the Criminal Law. As for Le Baochai, Bai Yongsheng, Xu Kangling, Fang Yongtai, and others, there was no evidence of their involvement, and the police requested that they be released. Bao Shuji then submitted a report detailing the circumstances of the arrests, and stated that there were many plaintiffs in this case, many of whom had not yet reported to the police. For the sake of expediency, he requested that the news of this case be published in the newspapers, urging all victims to quickly report to the police station to facilitate the investigation. Zhang Zhengdao confessed that although he issued promissory notes for over 50,000 yuan, he had recovered more than 40,000 yuan. The bankruptcy was due to Ou Rengwu taking away the promissory notes, which had matured, but did not return the money, making it impossible to make payments. The method of exchanging promissory notes for goods was also suggested by Ou. Ou Rengwu stated that Chen Jinbao borrowed the Zhenhua promissory notes from him to pay for goods, so the use of the promissory notes was entirely Chen's doing and had nothing to do with him. One of the victims, the Japanese company Kobayashi Yoko, also retained a lawyer to file a civil suit. Police lawyer Qian requested permission for a further postponement, as there were many cases in this matter which were not yet thoroughly investigated, in order to clarify the case and file additional charges. Director Dai Rongduo reviewed the report and ordered that the case be postponed for one week, and that Le Baochai, Bai Yongsheng, Xu Kangling, and Wan Yongtai be released.</p>
<p>Wang Liang and Others Accused of Joint Fraud for Extorting 50 Yuan in an Opium Case</p>
<p>Li Jinqing, a Ningbo native and employee of the Yangtze Hotel, recently filed a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special Court against Wang Liang (a real estate agent residing at No. 16 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road), Tao Ziyuan (a Tianjin native residing at No. 5 Run'an Lane), and Gong Kuan (a Chongming native residing at No. 33 Shouxiang Lane, Fangbang Bridge, and a court bailiff) for the crime of joint fraud. His accusation was accepted, and they were summoned yesterday morning. According to the plaintiff Li Jinqing's accusation, on May 21st, his relatives Jia Yichuan, a bookkeeper at the Jinghua Shoe Store on Daxin Street, and Yin Zhaolin, residing at No. 258 Lujiabang Road, were arrested by the French police for smoking opium. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special Court. Jia and others denied smoking opium, and the court ordered a postponement to the 27th for Jia and others to be sent to the forensic doctor's office to be tested for opium addiction. At that time, a civilian and Yin Zhaolin's son, Bingsheng, were in the courtroom listening to the proceedings. After hearing the order, they left the courtroom and were suddenly met by Wang Liang and Tao Ziyuan, whom they knew. They asked what was happening, and Li told them the truth. Wang and others then claimed that they were acquainted with forensic doctor Jiang at the Prosecutor's Office and could ask bailiff Gong Kuan to intervene. Li then followed Wang and others to the bailiff's office at the court and begged Gong for help. Wang Liang then said that the matter required 50 yuan as entertainment expenses. Li only had 20 yuan with him at the time and handed it over to Wang and others. On the evening of the 26th, Wang and Tao came to the Yangtze Hotel and demanded another 30 yuan from Li. On the 27th, the court's review resulted in Jia and Yin being fined. Li believed that Wang and the other three were engaging in fraudulent behavior and repeatedly negotiated with them. Wang and Tao admitted responsibility for returning the money, so on June 13th, Tao Ziyuan wrote a promissory note for 50 yuan, with Wang Liang as guarantor, promising to pay the money on August 20th. When the due date arrived, Wang, Tao, and others deliberately delayed and refused to hand over the money. Li did not rush to sue in consideration of the court's reputation, so as not to stir up society. Now, unable to endure it any longer, he has filed a lawsuit. Last night, Wang Liang requested that Li withdraw the lawsuit in room 212 of the Yuanbu Hotel, and said that if he was sued, he would have the means to deal with it, and gave him a newspaper to show him (according to previous reports, Wang Liang filed a case for obstructing public morals, and as a result, the plaintiff was willing to withdraw the lawsuit, and the court ruled that it would not be accepted). Wang Liang claimed that Li's words were all castles in the air. On the 22nd, he and Tao Ziyuan went to the court to measure land. He met Li at the gate. Li asked him where the forensic doctor's office was. He then went to the bailiff's office and asked Gong Kuan (Gong had sent a ruling on another case to his home this spring and they had become acquainted). Gong replied that this was the civil affairs office, and the forensic doctor's office was outside, etc. At that time, he immediately left with Li and others and dispersed, and there was no matter of entrusting him to help the forensic doctor, and even less of receiving money. As for the promissory note written by Tao Ziyuan, it was for arrears for the company's room, etc. Tao Ziyuan's testimony was similar. The official ordered that the plaintiff's witness, Yin Bingsheng, be brought to the court, who stated that he had seen Wang, Tao, and Gong take money from Li, saying that they were friends with forensic doctor Jiang, and that if they wanted to avoid being prosecuted, they would have to spend some money, and if they didn't, they would say that they were smoking opium even if they weren't. Gong Kuan stated that on the 22nd, the plaintiff and Wang Liang came together and asked him where the forensic doctor's office was. He replied that this was the civil bailiff's office, and the forensic doctor's office was outside, and that he had not helped in any way, and was being wrongly accused. Judge Sun Pengham then ordered Wang Liang and Tao Ziyuan to each provide a guarantor who could be summoned at any time, and if they had no guarantor, they would be taken into custody. Gong Kuan was dismissed, and the case was postponed to September 25th for further questioning. Wang Liang was temporarily bailed out by his defense lawyer.</p>

<p>Lawyers Association Submits Request to the Second Special Court to Improve Payment of Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association has submitted a request to the President of the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court to improve the procedure for parties involved in lawsuits to receive funds from the court. The request states that members have suggested that litigants often spend two to three hours retrieving money owed to them by the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court. The court does not prepare checks in advance for funds to be distributed or store cash to be transferred by the execution office. Instead, checks are issued on an ad hoc basis, leading to delays and long waits for litigants, often taking one, two, or even three hours. This not only wastes the time of litigants but also disrupts the order of the court. Should the court take steps to improve the situation by preparing checks or storing cash for distribution before litigants claim funds, so that litigants can receive their money upon arrival, thus simplifying the procedure? The matter was discussed at the 207th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Association, and it was decided to forward the request to the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court for consideration and implementation for the convenience of the public.</p>
<p>Smuggling of Private Cigarettes Results in Over 9.6 Million Yuan in Annual Tax Evasion; Ministry of Finance Taking Measures to Prevent It</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency learned from a responsible person of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association that since the government banned gift promotions, the business of domestic cigarette manufacturers has gradually declined. In addition to the dumping of foreign cigarettes and the deprivation of private cigarettes, there is even greater panic. According to a recent investigation, private cigarettes are very prevalent in this city. The source of the tobacco leaf is mostly purchased from various tobacco leaf firms in the city, with monthly sales of about 500 packages of tobacco leaf, which can produce 10,000 cartons of cigarettes. Each year, about 6,000 packages are sold, producing 120,000 cartons of cigarettes. Each carton is subject to a tobacco tax of 80 yuan, totaling 9.6 million yuan. However, this portion of private cigarettes is not taxed, meaning that 9.6 million yuan in taxes are evaded each year. This is only the case for Shanghai. If the inland areas are added, the amount would be even greater. It is heard that the financial authorities are now taking measures to prevent this in order to stop tax evasion.</p>
<p>Opposition to Hidden Fee Increases: Fresh Meat Industry Holds Representative Conference Yesterday</p>
<p>Demand that Four Companies Reduce Company Tickets, Publicize Accounts, and Organizational Content</p>
<p>Over a thousand fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai Public Concession, due to opposition to the Ninghu, Ninghai, Suxi, and Renyuan Four Slaughterhouse Companies secretly increasing transportation costs, jointly petitioned the Municipal Party Department to stop it a few days ago. After receiving the petition, the Municipal Party Department convened a meeting of both parties on the 17th to mediate. As a result, because both parties' words were contradictory, it was not resolved. The fresh meat industry specifically convened a representative conference of the industry yesterday, with Chen Longhu, Huang Qixun, Li Weikui, Wang Liangbao, Lu Shaoquan, Ju Zuyin, Mao Yicheng, and more than 30 others attending. Chairman Chen Longhu first reported on the progress of the Municipal Party Department's mediation, and then resolved the following cases: (1) Wait for the Municipal Party Department to mediate the Four Companies' secret increase in transportation costs; (2) Our industry and the Four Companies are cooperative enterprises. In view of the current economic downturn and difficulties in business, we request the Municipal Party Department to order the Four Companies to reduce company tickets to reduce the burden; (3) We request the Municipal Party Department to make the Four Companies, which have not held an industry conference for many years, to clearly publicize all accounts and organizational content, which the industry does not know in detail. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Revising Freight Rates to be Announced Monthly; Ministry of Railways Orders Railway Bureaus to Comply</p>
<p>The Two-Roads Management Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that the revision of freight rates or the new setting of freight rates in the ordinary freight classification table has always been based on the requests of various roads, reviewed and approved by the Ministry from time to time, and announced from time to time. Not only are the procedures complicated, but they also lack uniformity. In the future, changes of freight rates or new settings of freight rates will be compiled into a monthly case list and announced once a month for ordinary events (not urgent matters). Except for urgent matters, they will no longer be published on a case-by-case basis. However, urgent matters are still included in the monthly announcements to ensure uniformity and save procedures. As for freight rate cases, if they are urgent, they should be stated by the relevant roads when submitting the request, so that they can be handled accordingly. This order should be complied with immediately. The Bureau has forwarded this order to the Vehicle Affairs Department for compliance.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Holds First Board Meeting After Reorganization</p>
<p>The Public Concession Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society held its first meeting of the new board of directors on the day before yesterday (Tuesday) since its reorganization. Six people attended: Tao Deman, Wang Zhiren, Mai Xiqiu Zitong, Han Yushan, and Zhu Maocheng. Because the legal quorum was met, the formal meeting was immediately held. Mai Xi was elected as the chairman of the board of directors for this year. After taking office, Mai made a brief speech, expressing his apologies for the absence of the two directors representing the rickshaw owners' association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Chinese ratepayer association. He hoped that all directors would be able to attend on time in the future, so that the progress of the association's affairs could be based on the consensus of all representatives. Then, the secretary-general presented a report on the progress of the association's affairs in the past. The directors felt that the report was a sign of sound progress and service needs of the association, which was very gratifying. According to the report for August, there were 13,983 patients treated, 2,694 attendees in various education classes, 8,750 people at lectures and movies, 48,086 people at teahouses, 23,678 people at reading rooms, 26,612 people at game rooms, 24,843 people at bathrooms, 6,581 people at hostels, 347 relief cases, 506 condolence visits, 1,759 attendees at the dining hall, and 396 people at the barbershop.

It can be implemented once the Board of Directors approves it.</p>
<p>Regulations on the Transportation of Electrolyte by Railway</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau stated that electrolyte is a solution made of distilled water and acid or salt, used to manufacture storage batteries, and contains hazardous properties. It was previously approved by the Ministry of Railways to be charged and transported as a dangerous good. However, in January of this year, the Ministry of Railways stipulated that it was not included in the list of dangerous goods that could be shipped starting from 50 kilograms. Freight merchants have repeatedly requested its inclusion in the list. After investigation, the goods are packaged in two ways: one is in glass bottles, packed in rattan baskets, with each bottle weighing about 50 kilograms; the other is in pottery jars, with two jars packed in a wooden box, with each box weighing about 120 kilograms. This packaging is considered safe, and it is proposed to allow a minimum shipment weight of 50 kilograms. The Ministry approved this with Order No. 2012, and allowed its inclusion in the list of dangerous goods with a minimum shipment weight of 90 kilograms, effective October 21st of this year.</p>
<p>Banning the Abuse of Car Horns; Additions to Traffic Regulations</p>
<p>Regarding how to ban the abuse of car horns, the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council passed several points that should be added to the traffic regulations, as suggested by the Traffic Committee, at its regular meeting yesterday for implementation. They are: (1) Each car shall not be equipped with more than two horns; (2) All multi-tone horns are absolutely prohibited; (3) When honking the horn, only very short sounds should be used; (4) Except for urgent necessities, car watchers are not allowed to honk the horn while the car is parked.</p>
<p>The Police and Works Departments of the Municipal Council had previously conducted a detailed study of the mechanical issues of car horns. Later, the acting chief of police suggested to the Traffic Committee that the following points be added to the original clauses of the traffic regulations: (1) Each car shall not be equipped with more than two horns, of which only one can be powered by electricity, and the other must be a rubber horn; (2) All multi-tone horns are absolutely prohibited; (3) When honking the horn, only very short sounds should be used, with each duration not exceeding half a second; (4) Except for urgent necessities (warning vehicles in motion), car watchers are not allowed to honk the horn while the car is parked; (5) Electric horns shall not be used between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM every night. Furthermore, electric horns shall be prohibited during the summer season from June 15th to September 15th each year. The above clauses 1, 2, 3, and 4 shall be implemented within two weeks after the announcement. However, Clause 5 may be extended by two months when rubber horns are out of stock. When the Traffic Committee discussed the added clauses proposed by the Police Department, the members were quite opposed to the section on using rubber horns. One reason was that rubber horns were outdated, and another was that cars were not usually equipped with rubber horns when they were purchased. Because rubber horns are easily stolen, there were many practical obstacles to installing rubber horns. In addition, limiting the duration of the horn to half a second each time was not necessary in practice. Finally, the Traffic Committee decided that the following points should be added to the traffic regulations: (1) Each car shall not be equipped with more than two horns; (2) All multi-tone horns are absolutely prohibited; (3) When honking the horn, only very short sounds should be used; (4) Except for urgent necessities (warning vehicles in motion), car watchers are not allowed to honk the horn while the car is parked. The above clauses were passed at yesterday's meeting of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council and will be implemented on a trial basis.</p>

<p>Yuxing Pawnshop Declared Liquidation Yesterday</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that Yuxing Pawnshop, originally opened near the Xinqiao of the Sampan Factory on McCornick Road, was doing good business. Last year, due to the reconstruction of the building, it moved to No. 201 Carter Road. The manager is Lin Shenzhi and the capital is 20,000 yuan. In recent years, due to the economic downturn and the sharp decline in prices, the capital has been greatly eroded. It has been entrusted to lawyer Chen Bingxing to declare liquidation on behalf of the pawnshop. Here is lawyer Chen's announcement: According to the manager of Yuxing Pawnshop, the pawnshop has been open for many years and has a good reputation. Now, due to the economic downturn and poor business, it is unable to make payments, and has entrusted the lawyer to liquidate on its behalf to close down. Therefore, the creditors of the pawnshop are hereby notified to bring their credentials to the lawyer's office for registration within 14 days from the date of this announcement in order to summarize and compensate. Late registration will be considered a waiver of rights. The debtors of the pawnshop are also asked to pay off their debts in full at the lawyer's office within the aforementioned deadline to avoid prosecution. Pawners who have not yet reached the due date must redeem their items as soon as possible. Please do not delay. This announcement is hereby given for the public's information.</p>
<p>The Bridge-Dunn Road in West Shanghai Will Soon Be Renamed Lujia Road</p>
<p>Bridge-Dunn Road in West Shanghai is located west of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. However, its pronunciation is similar to that of Gordon Road. Those who do not know often misunderstand. Letters and parcels addressed to Bridge-Dunn Road are often sent to the well-known Gordon Road. This has happened many times and is very inconvenient for transportation. In view of this, the Public Concession Municipal Council has decided to rename Bridge-Dunn Road as Lujia Road from November 1st to avoid confusion. The English name of Bridge-Dunn Road was originally Jordan Avenue, commemorating Sir John Jordan, a former British envoy to China. Now it is renamed Lujia Road, and the English name is Rockhill Avenue, to commemorate former American envoy to China, Mr. Rockhill. There are many Americans in the area and they will surely welcome this new name. The Municipal Council will use other methods to commemorate Mr. Jordan after the road is renamed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lung Sanitarium at No. 4 Avenue Haig is located in the western district, with fresh air and convenient transportation.

The cost of hospitalization and food is completely free for those who live in the third and fourth class wards and cannot afford it, and the cost of medicine and injections is also very low. Therefore, many people have come to the sanitarium for smoking cessation in recent days.</p>

<p>Commercial and Financial News: Although Large Investors are Bullish, the Gold Market Ultimately Shows No Change; The Foreign Exchange Market Hardens Again, Short Covering Nears Midpoint, Briefly Falling; Central Bank Opens Cash Window, Liquidity is Somewhat Tight, Ultimately Strengthening; Gold Market Sentiment Has Shifted to Neutral.</p>
<p>As such, although the foreign exchange market continued to harden yesterday, buyers became active at lower levels.

Early in the morning, the overseas silver market showed a decline in London and neutrality in the US. The forward silver price in Montreaux narrowed by 1.5% to varying degrees up to 5.7%. Exchange rates continued to decline. The spot price of gold in London rose by four pence, with the premium trending downward. Market sentiment remained uncertain.

Sales from Hong Kong also contributed to the easing of the foreign exchange market. Selling pressure in the market persisted. Large investors competed to sell, causing prices to decline steadily. However, due to neutral market sentiment and excessive short positions, there was no shortage of support after the declines. The Central Bank reopened its cash window, releasing 420 bars, stimulating buying interest and pushing the price above 70 yuan. It was predicted that the Indian silver market would narrow by one anna.

It was anticipated that HSBC would announce the pound as neutral and the dollar as narrowing by 0.0625. At this time, banks were still covering short positions in shillings, causing the market to fluctuate. Later, the Hong Kong market eased, and there was still retail selling from Hong Kong, contributing to the banks' selling pressure. Sassoon also sold. The process hardened again and again. However, Chinese merchants and Guangdong merchants still had buying appetite, allowing the market to be maintained. The Central Bank opened the spot market. Rumors spread that a certain bank was secretly covering aggressively, gradually tightening the market. It was predicted that the Indian silver market would narrow by one anna.

<h3>96 Bonds Stir Up More Trouble.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was quite uncertain. Due to rumors of contact between Italy and Abyssinia (Ethiopia), market sentiment was quite panicked. However, as the matter was unconfirmed, market sentiment recovered. However, the 96 public bonds stirred up trouble again. The rumor of the resumption of business by Huiye Bank was rekindled. 96 bonds were related to the bank, and market sentiment suddenly became excited. Various groups aggressively bought in, with the most purchases being made by numbers 4 and 48. It was faintly heard that the backgrounds were large investors or financial circles. Judging from the situation, they did not seem to have satisfied their desires and were about to break through the 10 yuan barrier. The base price of these public bonds was very low. It was generally recognized that going long was easy and going short was difficult. The upward trend was probably not yet over. In the morning opening, market sentiment was extremely weak when the initial bidding was missed. Various groups rushed to sell, and the momentum was like a torrential flood, falling by three jiao. However, the long-term trend quickly stabilized, which was still related to long covering. However, the military budget cut had already brought a small decrease of two jiao. Although the market was still slightly weak afterward, it had stabilized, with only a small decrease of one or two jiao. In the second round, the market rebounded by 15 fen to one jiao, and the situation was calm. In the afternoon opening, the military budget surged by four jiao, and the rest also improved by five fen to one or two jiao. The number of 96 bond buyers suddenly increased, and number 4 also made purchases, continuing to rise by a jiao. The closing prices of various bond markets showed mixed results, with fluctuations between five fen and one jiao. 96 bonds rose by another two jiao due to large-scale purchases by number 48. The future trend was uncertain due to the large number of long and short covers. The market price still had fluctuations. The initial upward trend in the chemical industry had not yet ended, and there was still potential for further gains. The future was still unpredictable. The market prices, except for the current month's 20-point discount of two jiao and the long-term unified tax discount of five fen, consistently increased by one or two jiao. 96 bonds rose by four jiao and five and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was 9,580,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>US military stocks performed well.</p>
<p>According to a report from Xinfeng Foreign Company, yesterday (the 17th), the New York stock market was consolidated and stagnant, with US military stocks performing relatively well. Among them, steel, mining, and chemicals were particularly outstanding. After the price of wheat rose, the stocks of various mail-order firms advanced. The small exchanges were uneven and small. Public bonds fell. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,330,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn and raw cotton prices rose again upon news from the three main areas of production.</p>
<p>The price increase of standard yarn became stronger.</p>
<p>Prices for all months rose by about one yuan.</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend became more intense. Due to the increasingly critical dispute between Italy and Abyssinia (Ethiopia), market rumors began to circulate. In addition to the soaring price of high-quality yarn from the three main areas of production by four yuan, market sentiment was boosted, and buying interest arose. The market price gradually increased, and the prices for all months broke through the 70 yuan barrier, reaching new highs recently.</p>
<p>The futures price also broke through the 70 yuan barrier.</p>
<p>The opening price of standard yarn futures in the morning consistently trended upward for all months, and the situation was favorable. Overseas cotton markets turned upward, further stabilizing market sentiment. At the second and third rounds of bidding, market rumors were rampant, stating that the situation in Italy and Abyssinia was urgent and that the price of high-quality yarn from Osaka had risen again by four yuan. The market was thus stimulated, and buying interest increased until the closing. The upward trend was particularly strong. As a result, the prices for all months rose by one, one and a half, five, and six jiao. The market remained strong in the afternoon opening, and many short sellers were covering their positions. In the afternoon, the news regarding the rising prices of yarn from the three main areas of production remained positive, so there were many in the market covering short positions. The prices for all months broke through the 70 yuan barrier. Changfeng largely covered 2,000 bags, and noodle merchants also made purchases. However, the short positions held by Japanese merchants had not yet moved. It was found that the sellers included Fu (1,850 bags), Tongji (450 bags), Shunji (400 bags), Hexing (2,800 bags), Gengfeng (300 bags), Yicheng (400 bags), Shengyuan (850 bags), Tonghe (300 bags), Xincheng (600 bags), and Tongfeng (1,000 bags).

<p>With concentrated advantageous factors, the price of cotton rose sharply by more than half a yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton market suddenly rose, and the upward trend became more intense. Due to the tense situation in East Africa, various rumors were rampant, all of which favored long positions. The price of cotton from the three main areas of Osaka increased sharply by seven jiao to one yuan and eight jiao, leading to increased excitement and a surge in buying interest. The prices for all months increased by five jiao to six and a half jiao.</p>
<p>Zheng standard long positions added more.</p>
<p>The market for standard cotton futures opened with both the US and Indian cotton markets turning upward. The yarn market was also strong. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and most long positions added more. However, the supply of cotton remained abundant, so the cotton market remained somewhat weak. However, by the closing, it was heard that the price of cotton from the three main areas of production had increased sharply by eight jiao to one yuan, leading to a sudden increase in market sentiment and a surge in buying interest. The prices for all months jumped higher. As a result, the prices for all months increased by four jiao to four and a half jiao compared to the closing prices of the previous day. The market remained flat in the afternoon opening. From the second to third rounds of bidding, the yarn market tightened, leading to a movement in the cotton market. As a result, the prices for all months increased by five fen to one jiao compared to the morning closing prices. It was found that the sellers included Dafu (3,700 dan), Jinchang (1,800 dan), Senkang (1,200 dan), Shenji (1,500 dan), Yuanxingchang (1,000 dan), Changhe (1,400 dan), Tongxing (1,000 dan), and Yuanyi (2,200 dan).

<p>American cotton merchants guarded against damage to Egyptian and Indian cotton.</p>
<p>When the American cotton market opened yesterday, prices for all months increased by 0.06 to 0.07. The news from Liverpool was good. Traders bought in. Local merchants covered short positions at lower prices. Liverpool merchants bought in large quantities, engaging in hedging. At the same time, Wall Street and brokers also bought in due to the strength of the wheat market. Moreover, due to the outbreak of war, it was expected that Egyptian and Indian cotton would be obstructed, leading to purchases. There was not much selling, and transactions were limited. Long positions locked in profits. The closing was firm. The spot price increased by 15 pounds, and the futures price increased by 15 to 21 pounds. The spot price of British cotton increased by one point, and the futures price increased by 13 points. Speculators bought and sold Indian cotton, and Japanese merchants also bought and sold, but the amount of selling was not large. It was calculated that Pingguoer increased by 0.5 Robbie, Aomula increased by 1.75 Robbie, and Bailuoxi increased by 1 Robbie. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 17th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 18th was 203 Robbie, a decrease of 4.5 compared to the previous day's closing. 3,500-plus bales of yarn were delivered to the yarn exchange.</p>
<p>At the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange, the amount of yarn stored in warehouses as of September 18 was 2,525 bales. The most was 1,500 bales of 17-count Fugui yarn, followed by 810 bales of 16-count Fugui yarn. The amounts and brands are recorded below. (Unit: bale)</p>

<p>Food: Flour and wheat prices rose sharply, and trading was very active.</p>
<p>The flour market rose sharply again. The tightness of the situation and the briskness of trading set a record for this year. European wheat flour was quoted higher due to the situation in East Africa, and US-Canadian quotations also saw a large increase, with Chicago up $1.23 and Canada up $1.00. Market sentiment, seeing the high prices of wheat in overseas markets, was mostly anxious. Therefore, after opening prices, customer merchants and non-industry individuals tried their best to buy in, leading to a sharp rise of 0.03 to 0.04. The turnover in various markets for the first half of the day was over 600,000 bags, and the tightness of the situation can be easily imagined. When the market opened in the afternoon, some manufacturers covered their short positions, and many in the market continued to buy in, leading to another sharp rise of 0.02 to 0.03. The prices for September to November had risen by more than 0.05, and the prices for December to February had risen to 0.06. According to industry insiders, if the overseas situation continued to tighten, it would not be surprising if the long-term prices broke through 0.07. The extent of the price increase is listed in the table below.</p>
<p>The wheat market saw a sharp rise again. In the morning, the prices of wheat in Europe and the United States were uniformly raised due to the serious situation in Italy and Abyssinia (Ethiopia). The impact on the local market during the new wheat season could be relatively relaxed. However, now that the wheat season was over, international prices would have a quick impact. Therefore, although trading was not active when prices opened, prices had already risen sharply by 0.06 to 0.08. When the market opened in the afternoon, the flour market rose sharply, and both industry and non-industry buyers also actively bought in, leading to another sharp rise in the near and long terms. The highest increase reached 0.14, showing that the situation could not be taken lightly. In the future, the situation could not be assessed based on ordinary circumstances due to the unpredictable changes in the international situation. The price of spot wheat also increased by 0.03 to 0.05 due to the sharp rise in standard wheat prices. Shandong wheat was at 3.9, Luohe wheat was at 3.87, Guandian wheat was at 3.82, Zhenjiang wheat was at</p>

It hates that its son mistakes orioles and flowers for affection. It abandons the domestic chicken to pity the wild duck. It startles the mandarin duck, not the duck, and causes right and wrong. Today, the mockingbird teaches its son. The cuckoo's heart breaks as it cries out. Son, do you know how the white-headed old man's family business was founded? It's like the swallow carrying mud, not easily achieved. Who knew that you, the owl, would destroy the house? You don't think of striving to win the peng bird's journey. You idle all day, indulging in poison. You start a clam fight with the Pan family. You shouldn't have mistakenly listened to the sweet words of the Wang woman. You shouldn't have made an agreement with Jiang Wanfeng. You shouldn't have turned day and night upside down to call for opium. You shouldn't have opened the honored wine and wasted gold like a parrot. You shouldn't have chartered a boat to watch the meeting. You shouldn't have imagined marrying a pheasant matchmaker. You shouldn't have forgotten the Guansui transformation in the boudoir. You shouldn't have abandoned the fledgling phoenix affection with your children. You shouldn't be like a kite with a broken string, unable to be retrieved. You shouldn't have made your mother suddenly suspicious and alarmed like a goshawk. Thinking of you, pigeon, you have no brothers since childhood. The magpie rises at the door, hoping you will carry on. You must put away your wild ambition like a swan. Inscribe your name on the Goose Pagoda with early reading. After this lecture, the embroidered-eye bird sadly supported itself with its dove cane, tears filling its eyes. Who knew that the painted-eyebrowed young man wouldn't listen to his mother's words, and only made good sounds like an oriole across the leaves in vain. He retorted that burning the zither and boiling the crane was tasteless. How could he know that the love of a pair of mandarin ducks and lovebirds pleased my heart? The dream in the partridge couplet is hard to wake.　　Cheng Fangzhou, Li Liansun, Mao Jia Shu　　Huamei (1060) 3:00 PM to 3:45 PM　　Opening Remarks: "Group Wedding of the Shanghai Municipal Government"　　Magnificent official residence rises with the sound of music.

Graceful ladies descend from the Jade Terrace. Auspicious scholars are full of joy. Today, on the same day, they become husband and wife. A group wedding is unprecedented. Red candles are lit high in the hall. The poem "Guan Sui" is hard to describe. A melody of "Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Coat" is played by Western music. The bride's apricot face is flushed. The perfect match is like a celestial couple. Everyone praises and envies them. The party and government organs sincerely instruct. The certificate is glorious and joyful.

Changing customs and habits complies with ancient rituals. Abstain from extravagance and advocate thrift, a new life. The record begins with no extravagance. Red silk binds the feet of the newlyweds.

Movie News: "Mrs. Pear Blossom" Opens Today　　The talkie film "Mrs. Pear Blossom," themed on the issue of women's prospects and how couples can seek eternal love, opens today at the Jincheng Grand Theater. Directed by Wang Junda, starring Wang Meiyu, with Wang Xueyan, Wang Jianxin, Wang Cilong, Wang Naidong, and Tang Jie (Mr. Wang) in thoughtful supporting roles. It is a great work that brings together first-class talents. A famous actress, abandoned by her lover, wanders the world, facing hardship and misery, bringing tears to the eyes of the audience. The tension makes the heartstrings tremble. There are three opera scenes in the film, performed by Wang Meiyu with great brilliance. The songs are written by Li Jinhui, and of course, they are extraordinary. This is the first production of Yucheng Film Company. The Avant-Garde Battle of Young China　　"Young China," which has been in promotion for three years, has recently been officially announced to begin filming by the Lianhua authorities. With Fei Mu as the director, there are more than ten people buried in the preparation for the battle. Fei Mu is keeping the production plan of "Young China" strictly confidential, and it will probably not be announced until the screenplay is completed. It is not yet known whether "Young China" will be a full talkie, a sound-accompanied singing film, or a purely silent film. However, it is said that Fei Mu has been having Li Keng study Mandarin and pronunciation techniques for eight months without interruption. The start date of "Young China" may be next month, but it is generally predicted that most of the scenes will be completed in a bitter battle in the dead of winter. "Young China" will mobilize a considerable number of actors, and some actors may seek new talents to take on the roles. From the beginning, the main female role of "Young China" has not been assigned, and the future trend may belong to a "newcomer," but this "newcomer" has not yet been found, and Fei Mu has not yet begun to look for her. The original author of the script was Mr. Tian Han, and later Mr. Xia Wancang began to divide it into scenes, but it was not completed. Last year, the Lianhua screenwriting department revised it once and submitted the story to the central government for preliminary review and approval. It was then handed over to Fei Mu, who remained cautious and instead filmed "Fragrant Snow Sea" and "Filial Piety" first. This time, the Lianhua authorities officially ordered the start of filming, and Fei Mu happily accepted, probably after a long period of research, he already has a plan in mind. It is rumored that Fei Mu's script for "Young China" has been changed until recently a new content was decided. Fei Mu once said that the four characters "Young China" are too lovely, and also said that this film requires close cooperation of talents in many aspects in production, and it is by no means possible for the director alone to be competent. Based on this speculation, this film should have a completely creative form to suit its content, which can be predicted in advance. Silver Jottings by Zhi Er　　After Double Ten Day, the colleagues of the Diantong Company will all perform a play "Resurrection" once. It is said that there are as many as four directors (the four of "New Year's Money"), and all the actors will also be mobilized. Someone said: This is an All Star Cast. Li Lingdi, who stimulates the temple friends, has had some connections with the film industry, and is indeed a seemingly non-existent person inside and outside the circle. Now she has joined the accounting department of the Youbang Bank. Her name has been changed to Li Yi, and her business card has also been specially entrusted to a stimulating friend ×× for printing. From Li Lingdi, I thought of Diao Banhua, and then of Hong Ying, and further I thought of Ai Ti and Ruan Lingyu. A person is finished when they die, while the living can "rise from the ashes" at any time and anywhere. In this case, how can people die! Recent News from Yihua by Qingyun　　Director Bu Wancang's talkie "Triumph" returned from filming on location in Hangzhou Zhuji and other places, and immediately began filming the greatest scene of the Dragon King Temple, working for five days and nights before finishing the shots that should be filmed. Now Bu is leading all the staff to Suzhou to take location shots, staying at the Suzhou Hotel, and is expected to return triumphantly in about a week. Director Yuan Congmei's talkie "Storm" was released at the Zhenguang Grand Theater in Suzhou on the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the business is very good, and it has been highly praised by local people in the industry. Ying Yunwei's talkie "Hero of the Hour" is about to be completed. Everyone who has seen the partial screenings has praised it, and the clarity of the recording is comparable to that of foreign films. (Author's note: This is not exaggerated publicity, the facts are indeed like this). "Storm" is about to be released publicly in Shanghai, and Bu Wancang's "Triumph" and Ying Yunwei's "Hero of the Hour" can follow closely behind. It is expected that soon the world will be the world of Yihua's new films. "Triumph" and "Humanity" of that year have the same effect through different approaches, but observing "Triumph" from the perspective of Director Bu's improved techniques and that "Triumph" is a talkie, it is of course far superior to "Humanity" without a doubt. Therefore, the audience who loved the film "Humanity" back then cannot give up the current "Triumph". Yihua has received many letters from fans urging the performance of "Storm," and the attention this film has attracted can be imagined. The Sales of Shirley Temple Photos The three-inch exquisite movie star photos issued by the movie star photo agency sold by Yong'an Company on Nanjing Road in Shanghai are selling extremely well, especially "Shirley Temple" is the most popular. The photos are all taken in Hollywood, which is not available elsewhere, and the style is delicate and exquisite, the clarity of the photos is eye-catching, and the price is extremely low. It is heard that Shirley Temple's small photos are divided into three sets: "Life," "Sadness," and "Half-Length," each set containing four photos of different poses, and sold for only one dime, so they have been sold out in the past few days. Now more prints are being made, and buyers are requested to hurry.</p>

<h3>First Special District Court: A Prisoner Seizes an Opportunity to Escape; Disappearing Without a Trace After Emptying a Spittoon; Guards on Duty Summoned for Questioning</h3>
<p>A Suzhou woman named Han Aizhen, thirty-three years old, was arrested by the Old Gate Police Station for a theft case. On the fourteenth of this month, she was escorted to the women's prison inside the First Special District Court. Since Han was an unconvicted prisoner, she was not wearing prison clothes. Yesterday morning, around five o'clock, when it was time to empty the chamber pots in the prison, the prison door was opened. Han was also instructed to empty a spittoon. Unexpectedly, Han took advantage of the guard's inattention and stealthily escaped. By the time her escape was discovered and pursuit began, she had vanished without a trace. In addition to the prison reporting the escape to the Old Gate Police Station, which had arrested Han, and ordering them to conduct a strict search, the prison warden also interrogated the guards on duty, Sun Guangtian and Wu Chixiang, about the details of the incident at the time, and reported the matter to his superiors for review and action.</p>
