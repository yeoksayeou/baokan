<h3 id="c25">論薩爾歸德 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>恒</p>
<p>據最近外電。薩爾公民投票。已以四七七·一一九之票數勝利屬於德國此固在我人意料之中。國聯統治薩爾。十有五載。種種措施。自大體言之。尙稱開明。如對於居民之集會結社敎育語言文字國籍宗敎等等自由。皆能始終予以相當之尊重以一受治於人之地域。而有如許之自由。自客觀的立塲言。不能不謂爲差强人意之統治也。然投票结果。此一區域終歸德國。地蓋爲民族情感高於一切之結果。世間任何民族。無不願獨立而自主。受制於人。無論若何開明。若何幸運。於民族意識中。終認爲一大恥辱。故薩爾之歸德乃爲必然之事實。毫不足怪也。</p>
<p>於此以前。研究國際問題者。以德國政局之關係推測薩。爾投票或將仍維現狀。亦未可知。其所持理由。以爲德自希特勒登臺而後。異黨分子。頗多亡命薩爾者。同時薩爾境内天主敎徒佔絕大多數。此輩與希氏感情。亦不相得。若相約而投維持現狀票。則大勢何若。殊未可必。不知此主張維持現狀之德國亡命者流。以及社會黨共產黨等。於居民數額中。究佔少數。此其。一再則天主敎徒。以屢經羅馬敎皇通知。不可以宗敎上之嫌怨。妨礙良心上之主張。故始終並未有任何反德之宣傳運動。同時天主敎徒。亦恐德國失敗之後。歸咎敎徒。採取報復手段。故益不欲爲反對德國派張目。天主敎徒。旣已放棄其維持現狀之態度。則薩爾之歸德。自無問題矣。</p>
<p>薩爾歸德。律手續。今已完畢。旣後所待解决者（一）爲如何籌欵收回該處之礦產。（二）爲如何保　留該地之主張現狀派。此二問題。按照去年十二月三日德法關於薩爾之恊定。已略有規定。前一問題。卽由德籌欵九萬萬佛郎。贖回礦產。唯德國能否於一年内交欵。殊爲疑問。後一問題。該恊定曾規定德國對於投票反對歸德者。應予生命之保障。然事實上國社黨對於此輩儘有特别處置之方法。故此種規定。能否不成具文。亦未可必。故此二問題。若不得切實之解决。則薩爾之歸德。短時間恐尙不能完全實現。卽歸德矣。而關於全部局部之種種條件何若。亦尙有待於國聯行政院之决定。故不能謂投票之後。萬事卽了也。</p>
<p>吾人再從德方觀察。據昨日路透露。謂德國人民對於今次薩爾投票。意殊淡漠。當局通令人民佩戴襟花。遵令者亦不及十一。懸旗慶祝者。更佔少數其狂熱程度。遠不若官塲方面云云。此種現象。由表面觀之。似甚可異。然一爲細察。其理由亦頗尋常。蓋薩爾歸德。按照和約。原須經過十五年。希特勒登臺之時。曾向法國直接交涉。提早交還薩爾。不必經過投票手續。經法方予以拒絕。故至今日而舉行投票。純爲十五年期满之結果。在時間上絕未有所提早。贖回礦產。亦未獲得絲毫便宜。一切皆遵和約以行。是以德人視此次薩爾投票之勝利。乃爲事實上應有之結果。絕無一絲一毫之僥存在。其所以未有若何狂熱之狀態者。原因或在乎是然據今日消息。德人聞投票勝利之信。皆如獲至　歡呼若狂。則又如父子兄弟之久别重逢。喜極而涕。亦爲一極尋常之事也。</p>

<p>（蘇敎廳長周佛海在省府紀念週報告）</p>
<p>第二是製訂各社敎標準工作、以往各社會敎育機關的工作、毫無標準、或避難就易、不計功效、或徒事舖張、眩人耳目、結果都毫無成績、欲補救這個弊端、只有規定各社會敎育機關的工作標準、所以就於二十一年度、製訂民衆敎育館和農民敎育館的標準工作、令各縣社敎機關切實遵行、並製訂記分表、令各縣局切實的調查、關於二十一年度標準工作實施的情形、和考查的結果、前已寫爲專文、在江蘇敎育上發表過了、二十二年度開始的時候、又將各社會敎育機關的標準加以修訂、另訂（各縣民衆敎育區中心機關普及民衆敎育辦法、規定各機關須將整個民衆敎育區盡分爲基本施敎區和推廣區、各機關須於二年内將標準工作、在基本施敎區内辦理普及、現在各機關盡基本施敎區、已經一年了、實施的情形尙好結果如何、明年總考查的時候、當再編爲詳細的報告、</p>
<p>第三時分區輔導各縣社會敎育、各縣社會敎育機關的設立和工作的標準、已經有了規定、但是實施的情形如何、那就要加以視察和指導、因此規定、各縣社會敎育機關、除省督學·縣督學·敎育委員按期視察外、並將全省畫爲六個民衆敎育區、由省立各社會敎育機關負責輔導各縣社會敎育機關、因爲省立社會敎育機關的設立、一方面是研究實騐社會敎育實施的方法、另一方面實負有輔導地方社會敎育的責任、這種辦法、自二十二年度開始實行、施行的結果、頗爲圓满、同時又規定各省立社會敎育機關、須召集各縣社會機關組織分區社會敎育研究會、更能增進社會敎育服務人員研究的興趣、</p>
<p>第四識字敎育生計敎育的積極推行、中國不識字的人、佔百分之十以上、以致民智低落民氣消沉、社會敎導的施實、自然要特别注意識字敎育、又中國生產落後、民生極爲凋弊、而農村經濟、更是怨慌、社會敎育的設施、對於生計敎育、自然也要有相當的注意、所以我們在製訂二十一年度標準工作的時候、就規定各社會敎育機關、要以識字敎育及生計敎育爲中心工作、同時又製訂各縣三年内推設民衆學校具體方案、和社會敎育機關推行生計敎育具體方案兩種、令飭遵行、關於三年内推設民衆學校具體方案、除少數縣份因經濟關侮、未能遵辦外、各縣大半都按照實施、各縣民衆學校數及學生數、比以前驟增、就是這個原因、至於生計敎育具體方案、因爲人才和經濟的關係、尙未能全部實施、以後還設法推進哩、</p>
<p>第五是注意社敎機關主任人員的考核與保障、社會敎育機關主任人員是社會敎育機關的領袖、社會敎育事業能否推進、標準工作能否切實實施、與主任人員是否得人、有很大的關係、如果主任人員得人、那事業的規畫與進行、必能事半功倍、否則就難免因循敷衍了、所以自經頒布標準工作以後、對於社會敎育機關主任人員的考核、也非常的注意、已到職的主任人員、固要嚴加考核即將到職或預備到職的人員、也預先加以一番嚴密的考核、凡各縣選薦社會敎育機關主任人員、都先令其來廳談話、以便考查、考查時、除注意其學識經騐以外、尤其注意其社會的經騐、敎育的理想、工作的興趣、處事的方法等、一定要對於社會有經騐、對敎育有理想、對工作有興趣、對於處事有方法、才能耐勞耐苦、深入民間去工作、否則是不能委任的、還有各縣縣長局長、往往以個人的意見不合、隨便的任免社敎機關主任人員、使社會敎育機關主任人員、不能久於其位、當然不能安心供職、所以又通令各縣、切實保障社會敎育機關主任人員、一切的任免乎續、都須呈准辦理、各縣不得擅自處理、使各社會敎育機關主任人員、都能安心供職、</p>

<p>第七回　　　　　　　　　　留心現請東段　　殷</p>
<p>這士　將手　　大腿，　站起身來·轉了半個圈子，微微的跌着脚道：你這話，眞是透澈之至呀。說到這裹，臉色一正，望了志前道：剛才程先生說明袁有爲，是不是財政廳長？程志前笑道：當然是他。若不是財政廳廳長，建設廳廳長，豈肯和他的兄弟接風呢？李士廉道：高廳長請袁廳長的兄弟吃飯，有程先生作陪客。這是不用說，想必程先生同兩方面都是很熟的。程志前微笑了一笑，並没有答復。李士廉看這樣子，就肯定了他們的交情，已是有了相當的程度，默默的坐在一邊，只想這事的究竟。他自已想着，也不知道靜默了有若干分鐘，及至醒過來向前，却見王北海捧着一本書向志前面前走去。他心裹明白，這是人家在補習功課。自已若是知趣，應當走了開去，不應當在這裹打攪人家。縱然有話，等這人學完了功課再說，這樣辦，才可以得人家的歡心呢。他想着這是對的，於是站起身來，向志前行了個半鞠躬禮，笑道：不要躭擱這位王先生補習功課，回頭見。說着，走向房門口。回頭看時，見志前也在身邊，於是彎着腰，抱着拳頭，連拱了幾下手。不敢猛然就回轉身來，只管把身子向後退着，退到志前在屋子裹所看不到的地方去。他只管向前看着，去對人客氣，不想後面退到廊沿邊下，和那廊柱，正好相撞，　通一下，脊梁骨差不多都震得麻酥了過去。所幸院子裹無人，忍住了眼涙水、自已呆站了一會。和他間壁住的張介夫，這時却伸出頭來，向他張望着。見他站着，以爲他是想什麽事想出了神。（一一三）</p>

<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>以一張花花綠綠的紙票，流行於社會，抓着流通金融的生命之源，鈔票的偉大，吾人得之則生，不得則死，耳濡目染，事實流傳，拉雜書之，以供茶餘酒後之談助。</p>
<p>鈔票之顏色,因發行銀行之不同，遂亦各有分别，據一般滑稽家談及，紅者代表勞工勞農之血汗，絳色者代表面目娟秀之女郎，綠色者代表中國旣以農立國，應實行綠化，灰色者代表一般苦力之面目。</p>
<p>亡友殷清光有詠鈔票句云：得來一紙原空洞，栗六紛爭爲彼忙，又句云：艶如美女穿紅綠、暮楚朝秦不惜身，語含深意，頗堪一誦。</p>
<p>曩年曾見某富公子臥室中，板壁上應糊之花紙，却以鈔票替代，彼之糊法，以白絹紙爲底，上貼鈔幣，不刷漿糊，却以别針黏之，鈔幣本身却不損分毫，花花綠綠，可稱大觀。但金銀氣逼人，究不及一書一畫點綴壁間爲雅觀。</p>
<p>予戚蔭培君曾告予一事。謂滬上某校有王生，一夕與其戀人賭賽，以鈔幣作紙吹，取火燃之以爲樂，頃刻盡數十紙，王固巨商子，視金錢若糞土，戀人雖加阻止，王却不以爲意。如此暴殄天物，冥冥中恐已折去不少福氣。</p>
<p>輔幣劵爲鈔幣之低級者，流通之廣尤帶有一種普遍色彩，因活種之勤，遂容易破壤，近來巿上流通之輔幣劵，多污敝不堪，一劵分成數塊，猶連綴應用，平民階級中人，多諧音稱爲破布劵，是誠滑稽之極。</p>
<p>冥鈔之形態，固與鈔票無稍異，江北内地一般不識字的鄉下佬，常常上他的窮當。故鄉下人用鈔票，一面怕其僞，一面怕其冥化，他們視鈔幣究没有大銀元來得親熱。</p>

<p>師友人人有，言行各不同，敢將予所知，介紹一二公。</p>
<p>某中學化學敎師某某先生，解釋Ｙeast爲酵母，然（酵）誤讀爲（孝），一時發孝母之聲大作，可謂逸趣橫生者矣。</p>
<p>同學朱君，丁憂在家，某日，致書其同座某君，探詢校中近况，署名爲朱制ＸＸ。及得其覆函，未及拆閱，不禁捧腹大笑，衆不解，索視之，則信封上書云：（朱制ＸＸ先生收）（事爲朱君親爲予言）。</p>
<p>某君口齒伶俐，舉止活潑，尤善交際，素有交際家之目。曾以極妙之客套詢予曰：（你的家父在何處任事？）爲之絕倒。</p>
<p>同學某君，回鄉完姻，三星期後始返滬，事爲予偵知，遂當衆宣佈。有楊君者，問余曰：（尊夫人帶出來否？）余當以未知作答，惟知其已弄巧成拙，鴛鴦亂點矣。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>打距離十多丈路的地方起，便有許多的竹桿，高高矮矮地直立着：最高的比一個人還高，最低的離地面只有半尺的模樣。而這些竹桿本身的細，也各不同····最粗的比人臂還粗，最細的却祇有大拇指那樣大小。它們的式樣，更是奇特到了極點：有的是筆直的，有的是彎曲的，有的是頂上削尖的，有的還結着一個圈兒，它們的距離，也是絕不一律，從十來丈遠近的地方起始，一直到最盡頭的那堵白牆邊止，遠遠近近的都有。我們看了，簡直莫名其妙，大家祇有瞪出了一雙眸子發呆的份兒，要問也不知從何問起！</p>
<p>（這便是箭道！那些豎立着的竹桿，都是練習射箭的人所用的箭靶。）於是太后自動給我們解說了。（歷朝的皇帝和隨侍他們行獵的近臣，都得常到這裏來練習，各人輪流着射，每次連射三箭；而每次又必各自認定一枝不同的竹桿做標的物。務求三箭都能射中。大槪這些竹桿之中，距離遠的，以及大高的，太矮的，或彎典的，便比數不容易射：必須先從近的，直的分不高不低的練起，由易而難，逐漸的進步。及至練習到無論那一支竹桿都可以接連射中三箭，這個人的箭術，便算已到絕頂了；時獵行的成績，無疑地是非常優良的了！而他的聲名，也必將傳遍一國，爲人所景仰。）</p>
<p>我們並没有走上那箭這上去，祇是站在門邊遠遠地張望着，而我們背後那兩個用繩子懸空地掛着的鐵環，和這兩扇門，大槪不過相距三四步路的地位，正對着這個門框的中央；太后便旋過身來，指着這兩個鐵環說道：（二二三）</p>

<h3 id="c247">荒歉後的菜價 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 蕉心</p>
<p>每年陰曆的十月十一月之間，是内地人家醃菜蔬的時候。今年各色菜蔬却特别便宜，青菜每担四五百文，雪裏紅每担一千文，蘿蔔每担八百文，大頭芥（卽大頭菜）每個大洋一分，這種便宜的價錢，據說打破了好多年來的紀錄。那末總是貧民的福音了吧，然而不然，正因爲菜蔬的特别便宜，更害了農民没有了生路。</p>
<p>今年旱魃爲災，農民所種的稻，旣都乾死，一時田中又不能種别的糧食，便大家來種菜蔬，因此便超過了往年的產量，於是供過於求，價錢便大跌特跌。據農民說：這樣便宜的價錢，連本錢都撈不到，到出售的時候，因爲人手少，並且要僱人帮同挑進城裏去求售，然而城裏人並不需要這多量的菜，不能像往年挑進城來便售去，於是祇得挑着到大街小巷去挨户兜攬，因此等到售去，已經時候不早，而所得的代價，在城裏吃一頓飯，所餘便無幾了，僱人的工價還不够，更何必說到撈本。</p>
<p>照理菜蔬這樣的便宜，城裏人當然比往年要多買些了：但是事實又不盡然，因爲近年來的鹽價一年大似一年，現在每巿斤竟要賣到四百多文，譬如醃一担青菜，便要用四五斤的鹽，合起錢來，就是二千文。今年大旱之後，商業因爲農村的破產隨之而格外蕭條，城巿裏的人，當然商人爲多，眼前所必需要的衣食猶虞不足，那有餘力再顧及將來，所以菜蔬由你便宜，又因鹽價的昂貴，也大都無力購賈了。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>（一）萬年青</p>
<p>萬年青，一名千年萬，爲多年生之常綠草。葉厚而大，由地下莖叢生，花莖生於葉叢之中央，長四五寸，花淺綠，結子殷紅可愛，亦有黃色者，經多不凋，故有此稱。</p>
<p>種法於春分秋分時，分裁盆内，性喜陰濕，</p>
<p>澆以殘冷之紅茶汁，最爲相宜。</p>
<p>吳俗人家，什九植萬年青於園庭，蓋以萬年青之茂悴，以覘家運之盛衰。且舉凡移徙行聘一切喜慶事，必備之以取祥瑞，即不得新鮮者，亦須翦綾裁絹，肖其形以代之。舊歷四月十四日，爲神仙誕。婦女往往於先一日之夜，　去老葉，散委巷陌，謂神仙游戲人間，偶然踐踏，主得吉兆，而新葉茁生，自然秀發云。</p>
<p>（二）吉祥草</p>
<p>莊子之言曰：虚空生白，吉祥止止。植物中襲取其名者，爲吉祥草，是草濕地自生，莖延貼地面，葉叢生其上，彷彿幽蘭，長尺餘，狹而尖，有平行脈，四時長青，葉叢之下，復生根鬚，夏開細花，内白外紫，人家庭院中往往與萬年青駢植，但花開殊罕見，見則主　。</p>
<p>雨後分裁，什九得活，以伴孤石靈芝，尤爲清逸。</p>
<p>（三）書帶草</p>
<p>我友大漠詩人嘗以僧鞋菊書帶草，喻予小品文字，書帶草，出山東淄川縣鄭康成讀書處，本爲我家之物，詩人此喻，可謂確切不移。</p>
<p>書帶草，一名秀墩草，又號麥門冬。葉如韭，長尺餘，柔軟叢生，鮮碧可愛，雖隆冬不枯，中央生短花莖，開淡紫色細花。植之庭砌，披拂四垂，堪供清玩。實圓而藍，更有根上結小白色之實者，若取而剖滌之，泡以沸水，可以代茶，厥味津津而甜，且性凉，有治喉症之功。</p>
<p>（四）冬青</p>
<p>冬青叢簇，四時不凋，加以剪裁，自成籬落。若種於山地、任其暢發，可高至丈許。葉作卵形，端光互生，質厚有光澤，夏初開小白花，雄花爲聚　花序，雌花各朶生於葉腋。實紅而小，如赤小豆，與女貞葉長而子黑者相别。壓地即生苗，移植易活，欲其茂盛，須用狗矢　之，有細葉者，甚樹皮可製　，用以捕鳥，謂之細葉冬青。</p>
<p>冬青一名萬年枝，宋徽宗試畫院諸生，以萬年枝上太平雀爲題，無一知者，蓋名甚僻也。明洪武時，杭州各巿街，此屋植冬青，以取吉祥之意。</p>
<p>塋墓栽列冬青，常例也。李尊客過　石湖南宋，　宫嬪處，有六陵風雨一冬青之句，爲士林所傳誦。</p>
<p>誌謝　逸梅小品，出版以來，風行一時，茲續集又復問世，昨蒙本埠霞飛路中孚書局蕙贈一册，内容較初集，更爲豐富，而文字之馨逸風華，洵屬不凡，（定價一元，特價六折）特此誌謝，兼爲介紹。</p>

<h3 id="c284">明末的反山人文學 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 再青</p>
<p>山人名士的繁榮，大槪都在季世。這時候，一部分智識階級，對時局雖也感到苦悶，但並没有做撲燈蛾的勇敢，而（怯弱者）的名義，在表面上又不願承當。於是做山人，做名士，便成了這一班人的出路。意思就是說，狂放不　高逸的山人名士，天生的就是做（山水主），而不管（人間世）的。由於季世的影響，遺民的無可奈何心情，每個朝代的前期，這種風氣也還會存生在。鄭板橋家書，說（满街都是名士），顯然就是這樣的結果。</p>
<p>明末清初山人名士的如（蚊），其原理就在此。唐俟先生曾經引用過蔣苕生駡陳眉公的詩，說眉公　妝點山林大架子，附庸風雅小名家。終南捷徑無心走，處士虚聲儘力誇，獺祭詩書充著作，蠅營鍾鼎潤香霞。翩然一隻雲間鶴，飛去飛來宰相衙。）這首詩的確是很刻毒的把山人名士的原形醜態，暴露盡了。在張宗子的（自爲墓誌銘）裏，也曾說到陳眉公。宗子十六歲的時候，他的大父帶他到武林去玩，遇到了眉公。眉公這時正做錢塘遊客。他出了一個（對子）給宗子對說（太白騎鯨，采石江邊撈夜月）宗子便即景的對道：（眉公跨鹿，錢塘縣裏打秋風。）眉公有苦說不出，祇好誇獎他一番　　所以，在（不是時候）的時候，一面是山人名士的繁榮，一面也是反山人名士的加緊。拿明季說，陳眉公的遭受是如此，其他的人一樣的被襲擊。王百榖是東南名士山人的權威，張鳳翼就首先做（山人歌）駡他　。這首歌先是直署百榖名，後經朋友反對，改爲沈嘉則，再反對的結果，是根本没有署山上人的名字。不久看到一部筆記，裏面也有一首諷刺百榖的詩，用菓物的楊梅來形射他身上的楊梅。袁石公在京師消沉的一階叚，從他的（旁人笑我昏瞶瞶）的話裏，也可看出當時反對者的姿態。江進之雖有一假令談者自談，當事者自當事，即清談何至亡國。顧晋人之談，要以超曠清虚爲宗，謂其能亡人國，非也，謂其無救於人國之風俗，即王夷甫諸公復生，無辭以解。故所貴談者，貴其有救風俗也）的較進步折衰的解說，然而事實上是並不能遏止當時的反山人名士的運動的。</p>
<p>薛岡有一篇（辭友稱山人書，）暴露山人醜態，形容備至。他說，（山人之號，不著于古，古有其人；盛行于今，今鮮其實；有志之士，咸恥斯名。）他列舉出山人的十種醜態：（身匪章縫，家起卑陋，難親顯貴，故盜美名，思溷衣冠，以徼盼睞，一也。旣盜美名，頓忘本相，未通章句，亦議風騷，詰其所學，茫無應聲，</p>
<p>二也。薄操一藝，雜處嘉賓，月席花筵，旅進旅退，揖讓做作，居之不疑，三也。一聞好客，百計求交，耽耽貴人，以爲奇貨，甫擅交歡，反謗介紹，四也。察其喜怒，委曲迎合，得其意旨，婉轉趨承，日事左右，以求譽言，五也。偶然邂逅，退即造門，懷刺遍投，惟日不足，執理足恭，從　人始，六也。年無老幼，刺總晚生，交無淺深，稱皆知已，沾沾向人，誇其道廣，七也。旣稱山人，略無野致，輕衣肥馬，廣夏侈庖，馳騁國門，以明得意，八也。貪借厥竉，舌可舐　，稍拂我情，口常駡座，自取貴人，署門免見，九也。其最甚者，交好陽密，陰伺隱微，满腔機械，不可端倪，持人短長，快我齒頰，十也。）最後且說，（山人此人，辱莫大焉），而改（山人）爲（山雜）。對於（山人）露骨的揭發，大槪没有比這更醜的吧。</p>
<p>這篇尺牘，鄭超宗曾註其後說：（余每遊山，不逢一人。通衢廣厦，聯袂而走。竊怪山人二字，不知着在何處，千仭此文，足爲山　吐氣，），首四語可謂幽默之至。不僅此也，朱荃宰也曾一度（說名士）。不過，在他的意思，並不是根本上反對（名士），而是反對（假名士。）所謂（假名士）者，他引王孝伯言，（名士不必奇才，但使常得無事痛飲酒，熟讀離騷，便可稱名士），作爲解釋。又引王太尉與眉子對白說，（王太尉問眉子，汝叔名士，何以不相推重？眉子曰，（何有名士，終日妄語，）並加註釋：（夫名士應接，勢必終日妄語，而何以謂終日妄語非名士也？）所謂名士本色者，如此而已。李卓吾，也是一個反山人名士的人，他的態度更加急激。在與焦弱侯的書裏，他寫着：（由此觀之，今之所謂聖人者，其與今之所謂山人者，一也，特有幸不幸之異耳。幸而能詩，則自稱曰山人；不幸而不能詩，則辭却山人，而以聖人名。幸而能講良知，則自稱曰聖人；不幸而不能講良知，則謝却聖人，而以山人稱。展轉反覆，以欺世獲利，名爲山人，而心同商賈，口談道德，而志在穿窬。）所謂（剥去面孔十層）（衛泳評薛岡人語），眞是此文最恰當的註脚。卓吾一生，始終以戰鬥而存在，一部（焚書），簡直是一部思想鬥爭史，就在這反山人名士的短章裏也是表現得充分。</p>
<p>在當時，反山人名士的文獻，當然還不止此。但僅就這些看去，也可以知道，在山人名士最活躍的時候，反山人名士的陣綫，是一樣開展的。這種反名士的運動，一直延長了下來。在板橋家書裹可以看到，在清前期的尺牘文集裏，一樣可以看到駡山人名士之章。雖說這些反山人名士的人，有些自已也未能完全脫盡山人名士的習氣，轉變過來，但不满與痛恨，是很明白的。現在時代雖然不同，新山人因着客觀環境繁榮，新名士掮起招牌而摇擺，却是彰彰在人耳目。有些還如（吾家博士），自稱之不足，還要搬出（歷史的證據），聲言（古已有之），可是（古已有之）的，不僅山人名士的一壁壘，也有反山人名士之羣。古人可以談，古文也可以談，問題是應該客觀，要拿陳死人來作自已的擋箭牌，這眞是起明末諸公於地下，也知其非的。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>客丨丨照你這樣說來，用詞糢糊籠統，也還是舊文人之過，不能責備現代青年。現在（成事不說，旣往不咎），以往種種譬如昨日死，從今以後，要使現代青年的語文程度格外進步起來，可有什麽積極的主張没有？</p>
<p>主丨丨有，有，有！從前章士釗辦甲寅雜志提倡邏輯文學的時候就有一個很好的主張。他說：（凡式之未慊於意者，勿著於篇；凡字之未明其用者，勿厠於句；力戒糢糊，鞭辟入裏。洞然有見於文境意境，是一是二；如觀游澗之魚，一清見底；如審當　之蛛，絲絡分明；庶乎近之。愚有志乎是，寧云已逮！然文中不著不了語，命意遣詞，所定腕下必遵之法令，不輕滑過；卒爾見質，意在而口不能言其故者甚罕。）（文論）後來胡適提倡文學革命，也說：（今之學者，胸中記得幾個文學的套語，便稱詩人。其所爲詩文處處是陳言爛調，流弊所至，遂令國中生出許多似是而非，貌似而實非之詩文。······吾所謂務去爛調套語者，别無他法，惟在人人以其耳目所親見親身閱歷之事物，一一自已鑄詞以形容描寫之；但求其不失眞，但求能逹其狀物寫意之目的，即是工夫。）（文學改良芻議）我們要替現代青年開闢活路，（以後種種，譬如今日生），惟有使青年和舊文人完全隔絕，不要讓青年傳染那些舊病菌。一面來從修詞造句方面做基本的工作：替青年編些簡便正確的辭書，（不要像辭源那樣雜亂）使青年們易於翻閱，替青年整理出完善的文法修辭書，使青年們有軌轍可尋；替青年做一部完善的詞辨，（詞辨决不是字辨）把相同的詞類聚起來，使他們可以活用，把形似的詞註解起來，使他們可以釋疑；替青年選一部活的文選，（不要韓柳歐蘇那些死文章）使他們可以有好的範本。假使留心語文的人，大家努力來做，十年二十年以後，就可見成效了！</p>
<p>客丨丨有人做這部分積極的工作嗎？</p>
<p>主丨丨還等誰來做呢？你，我，都是做中等以上的國文敎師的，不該努力一點嗎？（完）</p>
<h3 id="c286">關於（自傳） <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>我向來都愛看自傳或自傳式這類的書籍，盧梭的懺悔錄，列寗傳，墨索里尼與希特拉的自傳，我都看過，還有胡適的四十自述，沈從文的，記丁玲等等，我也看過。看人家的自傳，可以很微細的懂得人家的生活，性格，嗜好，以及人生觀等，因之我非常愛看這類的書籍。一部自傳，假如眞眞能够没有半點掩飾，忠實的把自已過去一生的遭遇寫出來，那是一部好作品，例如盧梭的懺悔錄。但是，有些人是不那樣的，想借寫自傳來出風頭，把自已寫得是一個天才，一個頂能幹的人，那些可恥的遭遇，馬鹿的行爲，全都瞒着不說了，以前我在某雜誌上看見了幾個人的自傳，眞是頭痛得很！</p>
<p>最近，我在友人處借了　一部鄧肯女士自傳，看完了覺得很满意，這也是一部好書。她不吹牛，不掩隙，大膽的寫出來，有許多地方眞寫得動人，使人下同情之涙，她寫她伴着她母親從農村中流到都巿時，在飢餓綫上掙扎的痛苦，和由紐約坐牛船到倫敦時，旅費完了，被旅館老板拒逐出來，在街道上過了三天三夜，後來又用欺騙的手段，住在一個頂闊氣的旅館裏，這些情緒的寫述，是極動人的，所以我說這是一部好書。</p>
<p>我主張，每個人都能够寫出一部自傳來。自傳這東西，不一定要名流，學者，文藝家才能寫得好，其實，如能忠實的寫，大膽的寫，一個黃包車夫，一個乞丐，一個伶人，一個妓女，一個抽大烟的人，一個街頭賣唱的人，寫出來或許更來得動人，只可惜他們都没有利用文字的技藝，不能寫出來，所以一切動人的故事，墮落的故事，都埋没在自已心中了。卽如我父親，他是一個農夫，又是一個小商人，他七八歲時就失了祖父，在各種欺凌，各種痛苦中生活着，生長着，一直到他自已能够做小販的時候止，他不知挨過多少風霜，與多少飢餓。他告訴我，有一個長時期，他伴着祖母，吃菜葉過日·吃山芋過日，也吃眼涙過日，在這種情形下，受敎育的機會是萬萬没有了。到了中年，他又在兩姓械鬥中，執着火礮在前綫做過勇敢的戰士，殺過人，也看過幾十個頭顱高掛在樹桿上，在樹桿下，聚着一羣人在講飲着，高歌着，光榮的看着那些戰勝品！其餘在自已鄉村裏，看剜人的眼睛，割人的耳朶，······那些慘無人道强房欺負弱房的舉動，他是看得不要看了，覺得太平常了。我相信，假如我父親能够寫出一部自傳來，定是很動人的，可惜他也不會寫，也許有一天我來替他寫，然而别人的感覺當然比不上他自已的了。</p>
<p>還有，我有一位女朋友，她常常在愛情圈裏打筋斛，在五年中她愛過十幾個人，愛過大學敎授，大學生，文學家，也愛過官僚，······這一類的人，然而，愛河裏的小風波不能使她灰心，到如今，她還是有那副勇氣，而且她還是一樣的年青美麗。三四百元一件大衣，二十塊錢的一雙絲襪，二十八塊錢的一雙手套，她都用過，可是，當愛河裏發生風波時，她祇吃油條大餅過日子，穿着不合時宜的破衣服，向人借一角二角錢的事也有過，我相信她如果寫出一部自傳來，也定很可觀的。所以我覺得寫自傳不一定要名流，學者，文藝家方能寫，任何人都可以寫，卽要是他或她的生活奇特，屈折，不平凡，就够寫自傳。</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>（朋友，怎麽儘走也走不到呢，是怎麽一回事？而且，總是走些黑路，你可是要把我領到什麽地方）？</p>
<p>耐不住了，我終於這麽說了出來，質問着和我同和的朋友：我的朋友，他原說是領我開風氣的，但在哈爾濱這地方，當眞開風氣就要往黑暗地方走麽？這可究竟是要開那一種的風氣呢？</p>
<p>他是一個上海體育學校畢業的學生，在哈爾濱作了六年小學體育敎員，我們的别離也正是六年。我這次在哈爾濱能够會見他，眞是意思不到的；六年以來，由於斷絕了通信關係，我的記憶早已給我忘去了這個朋友的身段和臉像。我兩個是在道裏花園遇見的。他穿了一身頗不合於夏季的黑西裝，不要說西裝上皺紋有了好些條，看來不甚美觀，而且還沾了些油漬。他右手拿着一枝遍體脫漆烏黑的細棍，頭戴一頂褪色草帽，站在公園電影院門前，在向着那火燒紅蓮寺廣告出神。我先看到他的背影，可是使我立時想起六年前以不修邊幅見稱於諸同鄉中的曹保華。果然我的猜想没有錯，當我走上他的面前認他時，他同時也認出來我。他先我開口道：</p>
<p>（未行麽？我們這是在人世麽？當眞是你回來了？咳！······）</p>
<p>咳了一聲他就說不下去了，但我可以說他說的話語裏，富有無限的悲傷與感慨。我猜到，他對於我這次歸來，認爲是錯誤的。</p>
<p>我没有即刻回答他的話，却把他拉到旁邊的飲冰室中，坐下身子，才跟他互道起六年來的生活遭際。</p>
<p>這以後，我們的來往很密切，每天至少也要在一起混上兩三個鐘頭。</p>
<p>這一天晚上我又走到他的家中，一進門，他就器着說：</p>
<p>（未行，今晚我領你開開風氣去。）</p>
<p>這，我是非常歡喜的，所以樂不迭地就問道：</p>
<p>（好極了，可是到什麽地方去呢）？</p>
<p>（你不用問，到地方就知道了）。</p>
<p>但他這句話是不能使我满足的　我到底又接着問道：</p>
<p>（上妓館麽）？</p>
<p>他揺摇頭。</p>
<p>（那麽，小飯館裏吃女招待）？</p>
<p>從我的朋友第二次的摇頭上，又證明出我是猜錯了，我裝作負氣樣子，大聲說道：</p>
<p>（想來哈爾濱未必有輪盤賭，要麽就是大烟館）！</p>
<p>（别問了，過一會你就知道了）。</p>
<p>過一會，我就跟他同路走了起來，跟他來尋求開風氣的地方。</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>凡欲利用事物，必先對於事物有充分之認識。充分認識也者，就俗語釋來，卽懂得其門檻。門檻不精，則一知半解，何能充分利用。</p>
<p>利用電報，以得雙方通信之迅捷，此固普通人所深知。但電報究竟如何迅捷？與夫如何繕拍？能使電報充分發揮其效能，而發報方面，如何可减省其費用？此在利用電報者，大有研究之價值。故徒知電報之便利，未必眞能認識電報，必也懂得發電的門檻，然後可。</p>
<p>曩者社會人士，對於發電之如何能經濟合算？往往不加研求，若局臺傳遞路由，亦多茫然不悉；但近年以來，情形丕變，發報者門檻精進不少，而發往某處電報，若干時間内，可以到逹，若干時間内可得回電，莫不瞭如指掌。間遇綫阻擁擠，略受稽延，常致電話紛來，舉號詢問。故電報業務之處理，在今日之局臺，大與從前不同，此因記者旅居津門，業務人員舉以相告，確屬經騐之談也。</p>
<p>其實此種現象，正見社會對於電報認識之進步，且亦爲局臺人員所厚望者，年來交部改良業務，不遺餘力；如增進傳遞速率，考核電文凖確，施設以來，成績甚著。其目的亦無非欲使一般均知電報之果然迅捷凖確，以企得營業之進展，謀社會通信之便利。國人未能充分認識電報，則事業前途，窒礙殊多，今也門檻旣精，而局臺辦理業務之情形，亦爲大衆所知曉，繼此以往，行見利用電報，日益普遍。凡事業之進步，常須恃各方之鞭策，電報何獨不然。</p>
<h3 id="c290">與各輪船公司談談船舶電報欠費事 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 芬</p>
<p>船舶電報，有交本國海岸電臺傳遞者，有交外國海岸電臺傳遞者，計分來報及去報二類，來報係由輪船發交海岸電臺投送，或輪船拍交海岸電臺轉發内地各局臺投送之電報，去報係海岸電臺直接發交輪船或内地局臺發交海岸電臺轉發輪船之電報。發往輪船電報，在發報人拍寄電報時，所有應繳之報費，海岸電臺或内地局臺，卽可當時收清。輪船發致陸地之電報，則因拍發電報時，正在海洋行駛，其報費自不能當時付訖，惟有暫行記賬，日後再由有關係之電政機關，向該輪船所屬之公司結算。經由本國海岸電臺發寄電報，賬欵向歸交通部每季（三個月）結算一次，由交通部開列來去報賬單送交各輪船公司查對撥付。經外國海岸電臺傳遞者，由各關係國電政機關開具賬單寄往交通部代向各輪船公司收取。按照國際無綫電報規章，輪船公司須於接到賬單後，六個星期内將欵付訖，如查有不符，必須於接到賬單後，六個月内，請求更正，否則卽作爲承認。如過六個月仍未將欵照付者，其欠欵卽按六釐起息，是以外國電報局臺或外國輪船經我國海岸電臺拍發電報結欠交通部之報費，每逢一季屈满，交通部向各國電政機關收取時，無不按期匯到，足見各國政府商人極重信用，服從國際規章，至其辦事迅速，猶屬餘事，在我國則不然。據聞我國輪船公司接到交通部所發船舶無綫電報賬單，照章繳付報費者固多，但積欠一部份，或全部不付者，亦復不少。其中拖欠時間，有積至數年者，積欠數目，自數百元至數千元不等。雖經交部迭次催索，迄未照付，此項賬欵，内有外國電政機關委託交部代收者，各該機關，不明華商輪船公司所以不付之理由，迭向交部嚴詞催索，以交部所處地位，實難置答。此種欠欵，於國際信用，關係非淺，爰詳述如次：</p>
<p>（一）輪船拍發電報，事勢上不得不暫行記賬，已如上述。然輪船所發之電報，一部份爲輪船本身所發，一部份爲搭客所發，搭客所發者，其報費早經輪船收訖，輪船公司祇須扣去其應得之船舶報費，其餘報費，均爲代收之欵，公司必須照章繳清。現今輪船公司，非但不將本身所欠之報費付清，且將代收搭客之報費，亦一併拖欠。因此，交部賬務上極感困難。</p>
<p>（二）交部向輪船公司收取報費時，公司方面，往往不能如期清償，其所持理由，不曰營業不振，經濟困難，卽曰賬目不符，尙須核對。查公司營業不振，係内部問題，暫置勿論，至賬目不符，儘可飭令其所轄輪船，檢出報底，詳加核對，或逕向交部請求覆核。且每季賬欵，不過十數元至數百元，如能按季付訖，負擔並不嫌鉅。况一季賬内，尙有代收搭客之報費，公司本身應付之欵，不過其中之一部份，是更微乎其微。乃公司一再拖欠，日積月累，於是欠欵愈積愈多，無法撥付，爲公司設想，殊非得計。</p>
<p>（三）查公司之主事者，爲董事經理等，均爲社會上重要份子，維持信用，猶恐不暇，當無存心拖欠之理，意者公司内一部份職員（如會計或司賬等）以爲此種賬欵，無異於普通商家來往之賬欵，可欠則欠，不知此項賬欵内，有一部份欠外國電政機關之報費，早經各該機關與交部來往賬上扣除，如公司久欠不付，交部將無法歸墊。公司負責當局，似應對於内部職員，詳爲曉諭，使此項欠欵，早日了結。</p>
<p>據聞交部方面，爲國際信用計，認爲此種賬欵，不能久懸不結，將擬具辦法，嚴厲取締，公司當局，均屬明逹之士，諒必能體念政府困難，早日清償也。</p>
<h3 id="c291">一年來之國際電台（續） <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 張承祜</p>
<p>(乙)發展業務</p>
<p>國際電台設備之擴充，旣如上述，辦理業務，亦當追隨並進，庶全部設備得充分利用，而營業可以蒸蒸日上，爰述該台一年來新興辦之業務事項如左：</p>
<p>開放新綫路　丨國際台在二十三年以前，通信綫路陸續開放者，有香港，馬尼拉，爪哇，西貢，舊金山，柏林。巴黎，日内瓦，莫斯科九處，惟以限於設備，未便再事增添。迨二十三年二月，裝置馬可尼機告成，卽開放倫敦直逹綫路，於是此世界政治經濟之中心都會，亦成爲國際台早夕相親之一地。厥後交通部又鑒於我國日本僑民之衆，電信往還繁夥，向恃水綫傳通，利權旁落，深滋惋惜，乃與日本政府商洽，於六月一日開放東京綫路，至是而東西洋各國名城巨鎭，俱可經國際台而通信於瞬息間矣。</p>
<p>專線接送電報　丨末埠各大銀行及商行之進出電報較多者，爲經濟時間計，由國際台代向上海電話公司租裝專線，自各商家直逹該台報房，並於兩端裝設電話機，或電傳打字機，以互遞電報。是項業務，亦於二十三年開始試辦，繼以金融股票各業商行裝用者日多，該台爲便於應付計，特設專線交換機，派尃員晝夜輪值管理之，又各商户如欲派員駐台，接送電報，亦可向該台租用隔音室，該室構造，可使音浪内外隔絕，室内亦裝設專線電話，直通該商行，在駐台人員用電話與本行接洽時，無洩　商業秘密之虞。</p>
<p>增加送報效能　丨國際台對於各地來報，除裝設專線者外，均由報差乘坐自由車送逹收報人。茲爲增進送報效能計，除原有報差以外，特於去年先後添雇二十餘名，俾電報隨到隨送。送報時一律每差每次尃遞一報，以免稽延，並劃分上海全埠爲若干區域，規定各區投送時間，嚴令報差遵限投到，逾限者罰，不及者賞，如有住址不詳而能設法探送者，亦予獎勵，故各報差，莫不踔礪奮發，投遞迅疾。</p>
<p>减免抄報錯誤　丨電報旣須迅捷，尤宜正確，况國際台經遞來去明密電報，多關商情，一字之錯，責難立至。故爲增進社會對該台之信譽計，當儘量設法避免錯誤。交通部於二十三年十月間，特准該台招雇遞報生三十名，訓練專任校對工作，無論來去電報，在收到或發出後，立卽校對一過，設有錯誤，不待關係人之查詢，立卽通知更正，以期社會人士絕對信仰國際台之可靠。</p>
<p>稽查業務　丨交通部辦理電報事業，務使用者满意，故調查徴詢，不厭求詳，特令全國各局台設置業務稽查員，專事探詢電報用户對於局台之意見，而於國際台經遞之國際電報，尤爲注意，如有辦理不善，及應興應革之處，可向各稽查員言揭發，該台無不虚衷採納，竭力改善。</p>
<p>分送小册　丨國際電台自二十三年起發行小册一種，月出一期，中英文兼備，按期刋載關於國際電台狀况及國際電報常識，以供拍報者之檢閱。本外埠各大商行，均按期郵贈，如有遺漏，可向該台函索，立卽寄奉，不取分文。</p>
<p>創辦遲緩新聞電　丨依國際電信公約附屬電報規則之規定，新聞電應較尋常電提前拍發，遲緩電則反是，惟新聞電取費僅及尋常電百分之二十至二十五，蓋新聞電往往字數甚多，爲便利新聞界起見，故予以特殊優待也。但有時新聞不甚重要，傳遞儘可稍緩，若依新聞電計值，仍嫌過費，或至靳而不拍。交通部爲提倡國際新聞起見，特創辦遲緩新聞電一種，計費較新聞電更廉，拍發程序在尋常電之後，遲緩電之前。現已商妥互通者暫僅美國及加拿大各地，於去年五月實行，其他各國，尙待接洽。</p>
<p>以上各點，爲一年間業務上新設施之犖犖大者，其他如增闢日信電通逹地點，辦理巿内電話收發電報，設立業務問訊處，整理掛號等等，事瑣不詳舉。至尚在辦理中之較爲重要者，有如下述：</p>
<p>無線電通話　丨交通部擬在國際電台添裝無線電話設備，已詳前述，該台在去年春夏二季，曾利用馬可尼機之廣播設備，作初步通話試騐，試通地點有倫敦，柏林，舊金山，日内瓦，馬尼拉等處。我國駐德劉公使崇傑，駐瑞胡公使世澤，美國駐滬總領事克寗漢夫婦，及滬上聞人劉鴻生黃江泉諸先生等，均曾一度參預談話，結果認爲有開放商用之可能。故刻已由交部分向各國接洽通話辦法矣。</p>
<p>中意通報　丨意京羅馬爲歐洲政治中心之一，去年曾數度要求與我國通報，當經共同試騐，先以意方發電較弱，未能暢利，後經迭次改良，已臻完善，一俟簽訂合同，卽可正式通報。</p>
<p>專員接取電報　丨自交通部實行郵電合作後，滬上各郵局均代收國際無綫電報，發報人可就近交拍，以免長途奔走之勞。惟上海巿區遼闊，有時仍感不便，乃有用電話通知國際台，派人在接電報者。此事向由報差辦理，惟報差不能計算報費，收取銀錢，故只得限於記賬商户。茲爲普及計，擬設專員數人辦理之，並由國際台購備機器自由車數輛，一遇電召，立卽駕車馳往接報，回台拍發，有如商店之電話購貨，顧客雖足不出户，亦可與國外隨時通信。</p>
<p>（丙）統計概要</p>
<p>國際電台在去年一年間，對於建設與營業雙方並進，不遣餘力，其效果如何，當爲閱者諸君所願悉，爰述統計槪要，以觀成績之一斑。</p>
<p>業務狀况　國際電台去年經遞之來去報，月逹五萬份，七十萬字，較之往歲，頗有進展，收入自亦隨之增高。茲將歷年字數份數及收入銀元數總額，繪製簡圖，以示消長。</p>
<p>遞報速度　丨拍發國際電報，除裝設專線者外，普通發報人持報至仁記路沙遜大厦國際台總收發室，交收電員計字付費，打印交拍時刻，立由氣壓遞送管送報房，經登記員登號碼，註明路由，遞交發報司機員拍發，是項手續，約費時四十五秒鐘。至拍發時均用自動快機，速度原可逹每分鐘三四百字，祇以對方各電台設備不同，辦法互異，故各地去報速率，頗有參差，具見下表。</p>
<p>通報　　每分鐘收發字數，（每字　　通報　　每分鐘收發字數　（每字　　地點　　以平均五個字母計算）　　　地點　　以平均五個字母計算）</p>
<p>舊金山　一六○　　　　　　　　　　倫敦　　三五○</p>
<p>柏林　　三○○　　　　　　　　　　巴黎　二○○</p>
<p>日内瓦　一五○　　　　　　　　　　東京　　一五○</p>
<p>莫斯科　八○　　　　　　　　　　　馬尼拉　一五○</p>
<p>巴逹維亞一二○　　　　　　　　　　香港　　一○○</p>
<p>西貢　八○</p>
<p>國外來報，其處理程序，適與上述相反。來報由自動波紋機紀錄，其速率亦約如前表。收報司機員用打字機抄錄後，由皮帶遞送器送逹登記員登記號碼，卽交派送員開具信封，再由氣壓遞送管遞至派報室，交報差立卽乘坐自由車出發，是項手續，費時約一分二十秒鐘。至報差送報時間，自視路途遠近而定，全滬各處，均有規定時限，報差不得中途逗留，時限表以冗長不錄。</p>
<p>錯誤記錄　丨錯誤字數，視管理疏密而升沉，並隨營業狀况爲消長。去年錯誤實數，雖較前年爲多，然以佔據來去報總字數百分率計之，實較往歲减少，茲列表比較如下：</p>
<p>年份　　　　　　　錯誤字數　　　　錯誤佔總字數百分率</p>
<p>民國二十年　　　　五二三　　　　　○·○一八％</p>
<p>民國廿一年　　　　七八九　　　　　○·○二二％</p>
<p>民國廿二年　　　　九八五　　　　　○·○二四％</p>
<p>民國廿三年　　　　一四二八　　　　○·○二○％</p>
<p>雜項統計</p>
<p>丨國際台之資產員額等等，據去年六月底年度結算時之調查，酌舉如下：</p>
<p>資產總額　　　　　　　一九四八五四八·七九元</p>
<p>基地面積　　　　　　　四九一·五七三五畝</p>
<p>房屋佔地面積　　　　　四六一·九二方丈</p>
<p>員工人數（六月份）　　三八五人</p>
<p>每月薪工（六月份）　　二五八四九元</p>
<p>記賬拍報商户　　　　　一二一○户</p>
<p>發報機　　　　　　　　九具</p>
<p>收報機　　　　　　　　十九具</p>
<p>收發報機上應用眞空管　七四九只</p>
<p>收發報定向天綫　　　　一六付</p>
<p>各種發電機組　　　　　三三組</p>
<p>國際電台草創四載，獲此成效，雖由於中央之護持獎掖，交通部之努力經營，但苟非我全國人民愛護國營事業，提倡挽回權利，其成績亦曷克臻此。言念艱難之創始，期修美備於方來，深望交通當局更拓成規，俾業務精晋，日新月異，則我國電政前途，庶有豸乎。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c293">免費查問電報 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 清華</p>
<p>記者在本刋創的時候，曾做了一篇（查問電報須知），登在本刋最初幾期上，後來交通部編印（電報省費新章摘要）小册時，把這篇（查問電報須知）也附刋在裏面，目的要使讀者知道怎樣查問電報，得到充分的便利。但是這本小册雖然印送五萬册，實際上得到這本小册的人，恐怕不到五萬個人，看到這小册内附刋的（查問電報須知）的人，恐怕更是少了！所以我有一天聽見某甲說：（我某日收到一張電報，電文裏有一個字似乎錯了，我看不懂，就打一電報去問我的朋友，後來得到覆電，果然這字錯了。我就向電局要求退還我們來往查問的兩電報費，但是電局不肯退還，祇肯退還錯誤一字的報費，這使我異常憤懑，因爲太不公允了！）以上這一段話，在普通人聽了，一定要說電局的不是，但是讓我來把章程解釋一下，就知道某甲因自已不懂章程，所以吃了虧，不能怪電局的不肯退費。</p>
<p>電局一天裏來來往往的電報，大局多至數千通，小局少亦數十通，每通平均以二十字計算，每天多則拍發十餘萬字，少則千餘字，並且要迅速拍發抄寫，事實上忙中之錯是避免不了的，一萬字中錯誤一二個字，也在情理之中，不能說電局工作人員的不盡職，旣然電報不免有時發生錯誤，所以電局特别規定一種補救辦法，就是收報人對於收到的電報，如認爲電文中有一字以至數字發生疑義，可立卽向電局查問，電局當立卽免費拍發公電向發報避查問，發報局接電後，卽與原底核對，如確係拍錯，當立卽回電更正，（如不錯，也有回電通知）收報局接到回電後，立卽通知收報人。如此一度查問，在收報人與發報人方面，都不須破費，並且比較自已發電查問，回電得的早，因爲自已發電查問，須由電局派差將查問的電報送交原發報人，再等他查明後，派人將覆電送到電局拍發，這一來一往之間，就至少費去一個多鐘頭，倘使由電局發公電查問，則公電到逹對方電局時，可以立卽查對回覆，省去兩道派人送電的時間，而且公電在傳遞時，比商電要快，回電當然得的快。有了這兩種便宜，我們又何必自已發電查問呢？</p>
<p>讀者看了上面這段解釋，就知道某甲是吃的不懂章程的虧，並非電局不講理！但是我們不能專怪某甲的不懂章程，還要怪我們服務電信界的同人，缺少業務上的宣傳，所以直到現在還有幾家銀行公司雖然天天發電，仍然不知免費查問電報的方法，以致常常發生要求退費的不快事件丨記者希望各大局的業務稽查員，特别注意到這一點，隨時多向各大商行宣傳解釋，並赠送省費新章小册，使得他們覺得電局報務的週到，增進利用電報的信心！</p>
<p>末了，我再奉告讀者：查問電報並不限於電文發生疑義，如對於來電電文脫落，發報地名錯誤，發報日期錯誤，以及其他疑問事項，都可隨時用電話或面詢，電局無不竭誠答復，如有傲慢或不卽答復者，儘可報告交通部查辦，定有满意的答復也。</p>
<h3 id="c294">怎樣利用電報 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 仲華</p>
<p>本刋前幾期有清華君的（拍發電報的小門檻）一文，他把怎樣使拍發電報得利（價廉物美）的門檻，很詳細的說明了！但是除了（價廉物美）之外，似乎還要研究（採購）的便利。原來拍發電報，還有很多便利的方法，我國發電民衆，還没有充分利用牠，所以我再來談談（怎樣利用電報），介紹給讀者。假使你住的地方祇有郵政局而無電報局，同時你有事要發一通電報到遠地親友的時候，你若是以爲不能拍發電報，那完全錯誤了！你可以用同樣的手續，付同樣的報費，到郵政局去打電報。郵政局會替你用最快的方法寄到最近的電報局拍發。反之。你要是拍發電報到没有電報局而祇有郵政局的地方，也是同樣情形；電報局會發到距離目的地最近一個電局郵寄。這種辦法，普通呌做（郵轉電報）</p>
<p>有人說：有郵政局而無電報局的地方，固然可以發郵轉電報，但是没有郵局和電局的地方，又是怎樣呢？這是很容易解决的；電報局會替你雇用臨時專差送去。專差的費用，歸收報人付或是你預先付去都行。不過在收報人姓名住址前要加（專送）或一個Ｅxpress字樣，均作爲一字計費。倘若你預付專力費，那末在收報人姓名住址前加一個ＸP字樣）就是（專力費已付）的意思），也作一字計費，這種方法，在電報術語中呌牠（專送電報）</p>
<p>兩個固定地方，互相拍發電報，上面已經說過，完全没有問題了。但是假使你的朋友正在邀游歐美或是游歷國内名山大川，行蹝没有一定的時候，你仍舊可以利用（跟送電報）和他或她通信。怎樣呌做（跟送電報）呢？就是各地電報局自動地替你拍到目的地，也就是電報局代你去找收報人，直到找到送妥爲止。這種電報，也要在收報人姓名住址前加一個ＦＳ字樣，作一字計費，發報人祇須先付一段行程的報費，其餘由電局向收報人收取。</p>
<p>還有一種（轉遞電報），和上面情形差不多，就是收報人因事他往，不能收到的時候，可以由關係人請求轉遞某處，不必另發電報，雖然報費仍須照算，但是這樣可以使收報人立刻知道電報的原委，省掉中間人轉述的語氣，並且發報人也可以得到比較迅速的回電。</p>

<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>我國走江湖術士之流，於天下紛亂時，爲投合人民消極企求承平心理，動輙愛來甚麽（否極泰來）或(天未厭亂在刧難逃）這十八套。卽士大夫之輩，亦喜歡（文王神課），侈談龜蓍：而婦孺咸知的諸葛孔明，就大大有（觀天象按地理通陰陽曉奇門）的本事，着實能够（袖裹乾坤）。這樣一來，小小細民的是生是死，或存或亡，就通統在命·命而外，再没有其他的道理。</p>
<p>時至而今，宇宙之内又喊着經濟恐慌·大戰危機，一般人民舊創未瘉，新傷復起，於恐佈之餘·未能自已找到消災免難之道，又相率於途，前來算命。因之除一些星相家生涯鼎盛之外，而中外咸宜的（科學靈乩）竟大行其世。這就是許多專家博士均得以施行政治催眠術的原因。而報載巴黎　建天文台台長莫理斯　於觀察日球月球後，謂太陽黑斑不時放射電力磁力，能使人心神不寧，性情暴躁，因之潛伏了一九三六與一九三七年之大戰危機，及招致其他禍害；並引歷史證實其說，謂世界得慶歌舞昇平之樂，人類致力於藝術文化，當在太陽靜止之時云云，便係這種（爐火純青）的議論。</p>
<p>以科學上天文的根據，來解釋人類歌舞昇平之難再，和世界大戰的必然來臨，其高明實在與封神榜上元始天尊等用（天意昭示）來說明人們難免的刧數一樣，但是莫理斯自稱其對於星相之說并不相信，我們就無妨名之爲超科學的卜卦。其所以超科學者，就在乎有下述的幾個意義。</p>
<p>（一）太陽黑斑放射的電力磁力，旣已使人類性情暴躁心神不安，因而潛伏了世界大戰危機，這就無異於說（科學上）業已註就了（天命）。因爲現在雖然有許多科學家在陞同温層，甚至幻想飛往其他星球，可是竟究還没有逹到怎樣能消滅太陽的黑斑，或者（偷天換日）。曉得大戰要來，而它的來却决定於我們人類力量所不能及的太陽，這不是很摩登的（天命）麽？</p>
<p>（二）旣然是天命了，那自然是說，不單是軍縮海縮和賴伐爾等的奔走和平徒勞，就是咱們想點甚麽方法來消弭戰爭，反抗戰爭也都是白費事。這樣一來，好，我們都聽天由命的走向戰爭罷！因爲要設法消弭戰爭，反抗戰爭，就無異違乎（科學）。</p>

<p>往昔的情懷死了，而今祗賸得一個初冬夜裏的朔風寥宵。</p>
<p>我不敢舉起沉重的頭兒張望那失去了光彩的都巿的月色，呵，我更不敢去暗算那蔚藍的天空底一顆顆的明星。</p>
<p>朔風吹着，夜這末寒凉，我們好像那野獸，像那原民的樣，赤祼裸地在那靜寂的，寒冷的荒郊圍圑着了火堆歡笑而舞蹈。</p>
<p>（啊，跳吧！我們不管那文明的人問把我們當作什麽的走獸。來來，我的人，請來跳一個天亮，跳到早晨！）</p>
<p>（但是哟，我可愛的人，我不會跳啦！）</p>
<p>（那可有什麽要緊！讓我們像野蠻一樣跳，不管那什麽節調！）</p>
<p>跳呀，跳哟！身體怎樣如此輕快，步伐怎麽如此整齊！二人的心也這樣互相交鳴打着了拍節。</p>
<p>（哦，你有什麽不快？都是如是憂愁满懷？我們學着野蠻的原民不痛快？）</p>

<p>（哎喲，使你痛苦的心交戰是誰喲？）</p>
<p>（哦，這是你可誇示的勝利麽？我的魔娘！）</p>
<p>（你這個小拆白，還不屈服在我的脚下？）</p>
<p>（我要你這個魔娘的好　眼睛緩　黑暗，把你血紅的嘴唇吃掉，挖取了你的心兒來作我清償痛心之債呀！我更要把你這個豐美的身體整個吞掉，不使你還得生存人間！）</p>

<p>— 櫻之</p>
<p>假定，這是一個關於美麗的小猪玀誕生的故事。</p>
<p>父親是年輕的，同樣母親亦是那末年輕的。</p>
<p>年輕的男人除了正念求上進外，他没有更多此外奢望，他克勤自已職務，希望能够逐漸升上職位，增加薪水。他能够維持比較寛裕的家庭生活！他孝敬長輩，他疼愛妻子。</p>
<p>妻子永遠可還是給他一種莫大的安慰，有刺激的鼓勵，她希望丈夫，有一天能如願地開展出偉大事業的花朶；</p>
<p>幸福的生活中，丈夫對體貼的妻子是特别疼愛得利害，妻子爲欲給丈夫一個更好的美妙的影象，他開始結得一個美麗的果子呐！</p>
<p>美麗的果實，有一次在美麗的樹子上被摘下了，跟着帶有美麗的根蒂兒來的，美麗的小猪玀誕生人間呐！</p>
<p>祖父第一個先拉着嘴，開口他的最年輕的笑！他覺得他的生命眞活得有意思極了。</p>
<p>他每天刻板抱一下不懂體貼的孫子，拉開嘴，不停地作笑着，鬍髭刺吻着軟嫩的小臉，他感着比呼多陣子板烟筒更痛快得有意味；</p>
<p>他須要兒子爲着自已的體面，替孫子設一個有塲面的湯餅宴，自然也還是給家庭爭光輝！</p>
<p>一個最近理淺就的要求，尤其還是新任父親的兒子所應盡的義務。</p>
<p>日子在祖父的鬍鬚邊飛過！明天，後天，孩子彌月呐。</p>
<p>前一天，年輕的父親打從公司裏出來，臉哭喪得像下雨不久的陰霾的天氣。</p>
<p>下一天，公司的大門，張貼着律師代表清理的閉門廣告。</p>
<p>他一天等在家没出去。他向妻子說，他特向公司請了假爲籌備孩子彌月酒的事情。妻子因之感激得什麽似的高興起來！更起勁張羅這樣調弄那樣，手足不停地忙着。</p>
<p>外婆送了一個十分精緻，小拳頭這麽大的金木魚給外孫做禮物。由電話中關照明天他早晨抽身來。</p>
<p>妻子快活得笑開了心窩！但是他又怪丈夫太不會辦事，酒菜怎麽還不定好，請客片怎麽又不早發出？她說她願意請幾位舊日要好的同學來看一下他們的小天使的小臉也好。馬上她寫就了請客片呌女傭挨次送去，無論如何請她們明天一定須賞光候約的！</p>
<p>寫過了請客片她又問丈夫需要不她爲他寫幾個秀麗的請客片子給女朋友們？</p>
<p>她對丈夫瞟着動人的眼子，她靜待着他有一個極暢快的回答。</p>
<p>但是丈夫的臉孔正頽喪得很！並不像因設湯餅的那麽得意神氣，她又有些不自然起來呐！</p>
<p>她跑到外邊走了一回，回進屋子裹時，丈夫不知在什麽時候跑出了家！</p>
<p>直到晚上才見他一步併三步的踱回家來，臉孔仍舊冷靜得像白的石膏型那末可怕。</p>
<p>她睹氣倒在床上不理睬他。</p>
<p>第二天彌月的正日。大清早丈母趕來呐，首先抱起了美麗的外孫吻着又吻，臉頰上儘管牽露出鷄皮的縐容，張開着嘴。他問女兒爲什麽不替孩子把金木魚帶上了讓她看了歡喜！</p>
<p>女兒很快的跑過去開了手飾箱，但是馬上（啊）的呌了起來！她急忙的嚴問着女傭有没有看見太太給小少爺的金木魚放在那裏？女傭被這一問，倒嚇寒了心：奶奶不是自已安放在手飾箱裏的嗎？</p>
<p>於是又問着丈夫可看見有換放了地方？丈夫說並没有看見過一下金木魚的影子。</p>
<p>她急得哭呐，錢總究還不才乎，但是至少這是不吉利的現象，對於孩子的以後整生的幸福！她哭得太利害了，母親反也不敢怎麽去多說她呐。丢下了一個木魚又怎麽哩，亦值得那般嗎？</p>
<p>客人絡續的到來呐，酒菜早在二個鐘頭前挑來了。</p>
<p>飯後客人盡興散出的時候，妻子不見了丈夫。起初以爲是陪送客人出外，但是後來一直等了不來。酒館的人也走了，問他們又說早拿得了錢呐！啊：那麽究竟跑到那裏去了哩？</p>
<p>第二天，第三天······丈夫没有回家來！</p>

<h3 id="c300">勘災 <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>雖是深秋的時候，但是天氣還是那麽的悶熱，天空中是給一塊灰褐色的雲片壓住着，彷彿像快要下雷雨的樣子。</p>
<p>（今天縣裏派了什麽勘災委員下鄕來勘災啦）！酒鬼阿根奔得满頭大汗的向着藥鑑生報告：（是鄉長吳大頭對我說的，他還呌我告訴你一聲······）</p>
<p>哦！我懂得啦）！他再想說什麽，却被藥鑑生把話頭截住了，將酒鬼阿根的一股興兒掃得乾乾凈凈。他自已却仍舊瞇着一雙鼠眼，不住的抽着板烟，呼得烟斗裏吱！吱！的作響，眼看着從嘴裏吐出來那灰白的烟圈在空中消失，神情好像在計畫什麽心事。</p>
<p>藥鑑生是這裏的著名鄉董，他自家兒就在這鎭上開了一片藥舖子，生意倒很好，所以現在他已成了一個小富之家了。更因他的手腕巧妙，因此他的名字在鄉裏居然很有些兒響亮，便是這裏的地方官廳也要去仰承他的鼻息的。他没有田，更不是田户，所以什麽災荒與他總毫不相干的，但是這些區長，鄉長，以及什麽長等，爲了見他畏懼的緣故，因此凡鄉里無論有了大小的事情，似乎總少不下他的參加。酒鬼阿根是他家的傭人，今天一番起勁，却去看了他主子一副冷面孔，他於是懊喪地咕嚕着踅了出去。</p>
<p>吳大頭眞是忙得不可開交，一面替那勘災委員佈置下塌處，一方面又要到各鄉董地方去通知，還有許多鄉民都要去懇求他帮帮忙，要他代向勘災委員面前說情，請他到縣裏把災情報得重一些，成數報得輕一些。</p>
<p>第二天，吳大頭陪着了勘災委員下鄉去實地視察，區公所米區長，藥鑑生，和幾位有財有勢的紳董，都在陪同之例。他們在出發的前夜，已經議定了個調查步驟，决定先由西灣起點，打從東村回轉，這樣巡視了一週，在塡起調查表來，及到縣裏報告的時候便有所根據了。</p>
<p>那位勘災委員，矮矮的身材，頎長的臉，鷹爪鼻下蓄着一叢卓别麟式的短鬚，年紀還不過三十歲左右，但已是那麽老氣横秋了。雖然他有一股兒威風在各人的面前擺着，可總掩蓋不住他那副烟容。他下鄉去實地調查，這是驅鬼的　他們一　兒坐了七頂轎子，從東到西，從西到東的像大出喪那麽遊行一回，還不是扮扮鬼戯，誰眞有心眼兒去踏勘災情，該苦的還不是轎夫們的腿倒霉。</p>
<p>這一天是由藥鑑生招待，就在他家裏吃了午膳，幾位鄉董及米區長當然是陪客，吳大頭却當了一名臨時跑腿。</p>
<p>晚上在區公所裏討論勘災的情形，到會的除了日間原班人馬之外，又加進了一位區公安局長；本來照勘災委員的主張，想要五成報縣的，後來經大家討論的結果，遂决定以四成報縣，於是勘災委員也似乎表示同意了。</p>
<p>但鄉民對於四成數目覺得太吃虧，大家都表示不满，可有什麽辦法？不過只在心裏不满，嘴上不满而已。</p>
<h3 id="c301">冬夜感 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>坐在圈椅上，讓柔和的燈光撫摩上自已的頭，自已的全身，再懶洋洋瀉到屋角裏去，聽聽外面風的怒吼，雨的低泣，心裏便引起一種百無聊賴的凄凉之感，雖燒着火爐，但心裏却是寒冷的，頽唐的，如一堆燒過盤香的殘燼。在這種時候，一切的過去未來的事，都穿着很誘惑很魅人的衣裳，纒附在自已身邊。這滋味也說不出的神秘。</p>
<p>凝視着那凄黯的失去血色的燈，想，僅僅在不久以前，隔着窗就可見見月的皎潔，星的熠耀，秋之澄凈的天宇給人帶來龍井茶或綠橄欖那樣清澀而又雋永之感，（轉瞬間，這些便都怱怱過去，剩下的是冷，冷，這冷就像隻螺旋，深銳地旋進你的心。春之艶冶，夏之榮華，秋之秀逸，花的放，鳥的歌，一草一木的萌動，日月星辰之流轉，都似乎和冬天漠不相關，環繞在自已前後左右的簡直是個漫漫無盡的長夜，這長夜使人寂寞得想哭了。</p>
<p>寂寞得要哭時，只緘默着，和那灰色的天宇一樣。拿一兩本無害於事的小書，點着一支和平的捲烟，靠近火爐，看那煤塊逐漸地消鎔，灰化，看那火舌逐漸地蕩摇，變幻，似乎這當前的一切，都象徴着生命之生長與奄化，不說話，在腦海中吐着思想，在唇際吐着繚繞的烟，趁没人理會之中，悄悄地將過去生活加以温理，這正如翻開古老的書籍，一頁一頁地諦視着前代人的智慧，剪數着憔悴的黃花，一瓣一瓣地懷念着消逝了的温馨，僅在這不費力的勞價中，都會帶來深郁的回味，等到爐火燒殘了，燈炧人倦，端起一盃濃茶來憑吊着被燈光映到墻上的自已孤獨的影子，這也能給自已帶來說不出的深沉的慰藉。</p>
<p>在我的經騐中，冬之夜是最宜於默想的時候，没有一個人來擾你，除了那風的聲，雨的聲，以及像是把時間切碎了的時鐘聲，和漸漸消沉下去了的巿聲，因爲冷，你决不會想到外面去玩，你只能在家坐守着，因爲冷，你又不能正式伏案去做一些繁重的工作，或者你是没有家人，或者是你有家人而他們都已睡着。那麽，我告訴你，這時候你所最適宜的事，就是悄悄地來做一次舒適的幻想了。我們每天爲了衣食或爲了生活上一些别的東西，奔忙，喧囂，爭執，追逐，這樣磨去我們的一去不返的歲月，如果有這樣一個機會，容你靜下心來，對生活加以眞摰的凝視，你默默地想着，默默地笑着，像歐文所說的那樣，這小室就是你一個人的王國，這圈椅就是你一個人的寳座，隨便你憤怒，你哀悼，你鼓舞，你歌唱，都没人來管你，這時候，你未被世俗汨没的靈性纔得到茁發與伸長，這生命中最自由的一刹那簡直可說是一刻千金！</p>
<p>等到你追憶，感慨，懐念，這一切都過去之後，夜已在不知不覺中溜走了一大段，天是黑的，人是靜的，那時你就可不費力地脫掉身上衣服的架鎖，用睡眠的舒適來抵償這一日的疲勞。</p>

<p>美國各大車廠，預計一九三五年的汽車需要，必較往年爲增加，所以對於本年的新車製造，都擴大生產計劃，使得產銷兩方，能够適合，美國的紐約車展，定期在一月上旬舉行，拿已往的經騐來講，一到汽車展覽會開過之後，新車的銷路，往往一躍上昇，因之在每年一月杪末，是各種新車暢銷的最高峯時期，不過在事實上，新車登塲的時間，各廠不同，或在冬末，或在春初，而最多數的，當推歲尾年頭，一到紐約舉行汽車展覽會，各廠家便不約而同的，將簇新的汽車，儘量往會塲裏陳列，給大衆考察鑒賞，一班要買汽車的主顧們，就各從其好，在目迷五色，落英繽紛的盛大汽車展覽會中，揀選他們所喜歡的車子，因之在這個時候，不但廠方在製造方面情勢十分緊張，就是各經售商，也鈎心鬭角，各顯所長，爲他們的新車殺開一條暢銷的血路，所謂車商的年初推銷競爭，卽係指此而言，現在且將美國大汽車製造廠中的兩大明星丨丨福特和通用丨丨的一九三五年生產計劃，分别紀在下面，我們看了之後，就可以曉得，汽車商目中的一九三五年，多少是樂觀而甜密的。</p>
<p>一九三五年的福特生產計劃，我們可以從他們預計的數目字上，想像其鉅大的數量，福特廠計劃在一九三五年中，製造一·○○○·○○○輛汽車，代價是四一五·○○○·○○○美金元，這個龐大的計數，將由美國的六·○○○行家爲之銷費，單以車身一項而說，完全由迪特羅各廠所製造的就要美金一○○·○○○·○○○元，鋼·鐵·和非鐵質金屬，在造車時所需要的，價值約須美金七五·○○○·○○○元，這種東西中的鋼一項，除了福特廠中月鍊的不計外，另外要拿美金五三·六○○·○○○元，向巿上去採購，此外美金六·六一八·○○○元採購可伸縮的鑄鐵，二·六八三·○○○元的鍊鐵，這是全球最鉅大的羅琪河福特鍊鍜廠中所特出的金屬品，木料價值三百萬美金。</p>
<p>橡皮在汽車製造中，消耗的分量很多，所以在一九三五年中，福特預計各橡皮廠售給他們的胎輪，價值要逹美金二二·五○○·○○○元，粗橡皮六·○○○·○○○元，關於製造和製飾車身兩項，需要美金三二·○○○·○○○元，其中一六·七二七·○○○元，用作座墊·布毯·皮·和裝飾物品之需要，一一·○○○·○○○元的玻璃，和四·三○○·○○○元的漆料。</p>
<p>講到製造方面，福特廠早已投資美金一四·○○○·○○○元，去擴充他的鋼廠和機力廠，廠中的機件裝置另外還要美金二·五○○·○○○元，福特在這一年中，因爲運輸上的關係，將付鐵路運輸費七四·○○○·○○○元，福特的迪特羅廠的員工薪資總數，也要六·八六一·○○○元，福特廠中今年夏末所僱的工人逹五三·○○○人，目下因爲在更改生產計劃，所以人數較减，如果照上面所講的計劃一一實行的時候，那末預計僱工數目就要八七·○○○人，從前福特廠中的工人，和迪特羅區中的機匠，都將被僱工作。</p>
<p>通用汽車公司的一九三五年產量，預計也是非常的龐大，不過公司當局的見解，以爲與其在歲尾年首有大量出產，而使工作方面極度的緊張，不如將這個生產高峯時期中的工作，平均支配在一年之中，免得財力和人力方面兩不適宜，因爲這個緣故，通用的一九三五年生產計劃，比之往昔稍有不同，他們雖然没有將新車的製造計劃正式宣佈，不過據說他們第一步要造的是寳塔克，次爲雪佛蘭，再次爲哇爾特司麻别爾，至於一九三五年的别克·拉薩爾·和卡迭拉克等，那末非再隔上幾個月，大衆是不爲知道他的内容和詳情的，通用廠爲什麽要如此預定他們的生產計劃，吾們　了下面的說明，就可以明白</p>
<p>據通用當局者的意思，他們所以要在一九三五年中採取上述計劃的緣故，唯一目的，是要使被僱的工人們，獲得繼續的工作，其方法就是拿一年中的工作程序，使能平均發展，將生產最高峯時期的龐大工作，適合支配於一年之中，所以將來通用新車的模型，不一定在春初可以看得到，也許在夏末或是初秋，方纔能和大衆相見，至於在目前呢，通用和其他各公司相仿，所有的新車，大多在歲尾或年頭，一二上巿，其他時候，新車是不常見得到的。</p>
<p>說起汽車銷售的節季關係，也是一件很有味而值得注意的，因爲汽車巿塲和其他巿塲相彷彿，一年之中有一個時期銷數最爲暢旺，成爲銷售上的最高峯，照通常的成例，一年中汽車最得暢銷的，要算每年開首的六個月丨丨從一月起至六月底止，這一時期中所銷出去的汽車，常佔全年銷數的百分之六十，一年中銷售最弱的節季，當推冬季的十一月和十二月兩個月，那時候因爲新車尙未登塲，購買者都觀望不前，所以成交的成數祗佔百分之七·五，四五兩月的銷數佔百分之二十四，從上面的計數看起來，我們可以知道一年中間的生產情况，是很不一定的，像春夏之交頓時的膨脹起來，可是清淡的時期，工人和工作都要减低，這樣的一進一出，對於管理及經濟上，都有太過和不及的兩種現象，在工作緊張的節季，工人們都要延長工作時間，擴充發展工作時的能力，可是一到冬季，因爲銷路呆滯，生產數量便要大爲裁减，工人們這樣的一曝十寒，實在是非常不合算的，所以通用當局便設法將工作均匀起來。免得像這樣的時而緊張，時而鬆懈共理甚明。</p>

<p>— 篔</p>
<p>一九三五年式地上飛與赫德森新車之最後道路測騐與試騐室測騐。茲已完全蔵事。此項車輛。卽將由赫德森廠裝配出廠。按施於此項新車之一切測騐工作。胥極精細嚴密之至。如僅以道路駕駛而言。綜計卽已逾五十萬英里。其中若干輛。出行於馬路之上。其所歷途程。並已不下十萬英里。又一九三五式引擎之一。近曾以最嚴格之工率計檢騐之。考此種檢騐。曩僅施於航空引擎者。彷彿似之耳。若汽車引擎。則其所受檢騐。從無若斯之嚴格者。</p>
<p>當此種工率計檢騐實施之際。引擎於裝儎足量之情形下。駛動逹九日之久。以由每小時七十六至八十四英里之車行速率。作二○八小時之駛動。至於拐軸。則於此檢騐中。計共作五千萬轉。每一活塞。行程約逹八千英里。火星塞則發火凡二千五百萬次。故如以末擋速度。作一整年之使用。或可與此試騐。約略相等。蓋於此試騐中。車行哩程。總數逹一萬七千英里也。廠方根據此種試騐室檢騐與道路檢騐之結果。從事於其出品之研究改良。精益求精。此地上飛與赫德森新車之動作效能。與堅强鞏固。所以較前尤爲進步。而彌見其出色當行。逈不可及也。</p>
<p>新車特色之一。厥爲鎔接而成之純鋼車頂。按自鋼質車身發明以來。此項車頂。卽已爲車身製造廠家所寤寐以求之者。今則赫德森廠。獨能解决一切難題。而首先採用之。洵難能而可貴矣。新車又一特色。卽汽車管理新方法之應用是也。按因採用新法。調排桿與手扳　車桿之前厢。因而完全廓清。關於此項新法之種種詳情。赫德森汽車廠刻尙保守秘密。惟此一特色。當必爲一九三五年式新車種種特色中之最爲汽車　人士所津津樂道者。蓋可斷言也。</p>
<p>按以外觀言之。新車之低長與寛大。均駕巿上流行式樣而上之。至其動作效能之精優卓絕。雖屢創空前紀錄之以前式樣。亦有所不逮。此則種種嚴格測騐。固已證明之者。</p>

<p>— 與青</p>
<p>今以余（夏鄭鵾自稱）親歷之經騐與鄙見總括言之。則木炭之應用於公路運輸。實屬急宜極力提倡之要舉。我人皆知木炭汽車。尙未全臻完美。是以未能普遍採取。顧以不產滴點汽油之我國。而欲談國防。而欲談挽回漏巵。則木炭汽車卽稍有不满之處。我人亦惟有暫忍</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>之。蓋在大體上。木炭車之在法日意等國。可謂已臻成功。卽以湘省之情形而論。亦確已足資應用之程度。故不欲談國防則已。如欲談國防也。除非立得石油巨礦不辦也。否則凡關於替代汽油之重要材料。如木炭·酒精等物。我人皆應全力赴之。雖今日之所謂木炭車者。不過加一煤氣爐而已。（除此以外完全仍爲汽油汽車之機械）實因限於整個車輛機械之未曾改造。不满之處。在勢難免。（最大之不满厥惟上坡無力）我人如願以鉅欵經營整個車輛之改造。則木炭汽車之更爲適宜。可立待也。</p>
<p>現在以湘省一省而言。利用木炭汽車（或稱煤汽車）就未普遍。僅省府指令長衡段（長沙至衡陽）爲試用木炭車之路綫。該段計長一八二公里。現有木炭車八九輛。行駛其間。（作爲普通長途汽車之用）但實際上長沙至衡陽之木炭車。寥寥無幾。當鵾等在湘之時。（二十三年二月底）該省之木炭汽車完全用於運輸者。祇有長沙至下攝司一段。該段里程不過五十七公里而已。以此可知該省之木炭汽車。亦尙在試用期中也。卽該省指定研究木炭汽車之向德工程師。亦稱該種車輛。多屬試騐性質云。（完）</p>

<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>好萊塢的預言家逹理歐氏，對於各大明星的將來，還有以下的預示：</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白（Ｃhanf　Ｅlle　Ｃolber）在今年春前，或秋後，將遭遇一種强暴行爲，或是無意的，或是故意的。她本年之内，將有兩次大變動，但是到了年終，她就要追踪嘉寳而自已隱秘起來了。她本年内將受一　風流案的牽涉。耐爾漢密頓（Ｎeil　Ｈamilton）如果要拍航空片子的話，他將遇到不測之禍。如果僱用替身的話，那替身亦一定喪失生命或受重傷。凱茀蘭茜絲（Ｋay　Ｆrancis）在本年内，將在感情上，受到空氣衝動，她將嫁一位世界大明星，但是結果極不佳，因他們的性情，本來是不宜於作夫婦的。她將在歐洲拍一張影片，但亦無所成就。</p>
<p>茂立斯希佛萊（Ｍaurice　Ｃhevalier）將和一位黑髮的電影明星結婚（按此即指凱茀蘭茜絲而言者），但結果不佳。他本年内，身體將受重傷，或將有折足之禍。一九三五年是平竟勞斯見（Ｂing　Ｃrotby）在影界没落之期。他不久將仍回到無綫電台上去，但他將到英國去拍一張片子。他的子女之一將得重病，但不至於死。茂琳霍金絲（Ｍiriam　Ｈopkina）在本年内將享盛名。她的戀愛生活，在以後三年之内，將繼續保持，但她仍舊不和他結婚。卡珞兒郎白Ｃarole　Ｌombard)傳聞和她的前夫重合但此終難成爲事實。她將嫁給一個影界以外的男子，結果很圓满，今年春天，她將進醫院住幾個星期。</p>
<p>琪恩哈羅本年内，在事業上將有極大的成就，但在情感上，却不很得意。本年春初，有影界鉅子一人喪妻，而向琪恩求婚。但她却愛着另外一個人，而那人又不能娶她。結果，她又嫁却一個電影明星　不是米高梅的。她的婚姻亦不是美满的。琪恩哈羅的終身，是没有美满姻緣的希望的。葛羅　亞史璜蓀（Ｇlaria　Ｓwancon）本年將有空前的成就。但在愛情上，她却將感受到無限的苦楚。再　是可能的，但是不一定。阿道爾夫孟郁（Ａaolphe　Ｍenjou）在本年夏秋之間，將得重病。他家裏亦將有病人，或其妻亦未可知，但家庭是和樂無間的。他將得一子。</p>
<p>薛爾維　雪妮（Ｓitria　Ｓtaoey）本年内將嫁人，但她是重視她的事業的，所以她婚後仍舊繼續工作於電影　到年終的時候，她將得神經極度衰弱之症。梅蕙絲（Ｍae　Ｗet）的電影生活，在本年之内將告一結束。以後她將重事於著作，或製造影片，或重登舞台，結果將享受無上的成功。她本年内没有結婚的事，但有人要綁她，或傷害她，因爲她得罪了一般下等社會的人。她在一九三六年，在舞台上將有大成功。</p>
<p>克拉克　博（Ｃlar　Ｇoble）在今年夏天將遭遇一種無妄之災。她將被一個婦人控告誘姦她的女兒。事情是　造的，但是一定要經過了許多無謂的宣傳，才能水落石出。在事業上，本年是他的成功之年，但在家庭方面，却將有病痛之厄。喬治賴甫德（Ｇeorge　Ｒaft）在事業上，已經到了最高的地位。在一九三五年中，他將低落下去。他想離婚而不離，因爲他的老婆，是堅决反對離異的。</p>
<p>巴巴拉史丹薇（Ｂaroara　Ｓtanwyck）本年内將和她的丈夫進行離婚訴訟，但結果完全調解，夫妻和好如初，她將抱養一個紅髮的螟蛤女。羅蘭妲楊（Ｌorctla　Ｙoung）自今年五月起，將一帆風順，享受三年的成功。她在事業上和愛情上，將有極大的糾紛。但她至少應當等候一九三六年，才可以結婚，因爲一九三六年以前的結合是不利的。珍妮蓋諾本年結婚之後，生活很美满。但她的電影生活，亦就此告終了。蕭麗鄧波兒（Ｓhirley　Ｔemple）本年將繼續高昇，但有舛人要綁她</p>
<p>曼麗璧克馥（Ｍary　Ｐicklord）和范朋克（Ｄougla　Ｆairbankb）的前途，是很危險的。他們永久没有恢復夫婦關係的可能的，但是他們的友誼仍可保存。曼麗以後將再不拍戲，但將從事於著作和導演。她在本年内將有極不快樂的事發生，因爲一個生於八月中的男子而生的。范朋克的電影事業，並没有什麽發展。小范朋反將留居英國，並在英國娶一女伶，但結果不甚美满。</p>
<p>却爾斯福雷（Ｃharles　Ｆarrell）的演員生活，即此告終，此後將作導演工作。安哈婷（Ａnh　Harding)本年將有一張至偉大的影片成功。琴妮麥唐納（Ｊeantfta　Ｍac　Ｄonall）本年將結婚。　將受虚　，珍飾被盗匪刼。其餘的預言，不勝　述，我們且就以上諸點，拭目以觀其後好了。（完）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＨisＧreatesr　Ｇamble</p>
<p>丨大上海</p>
<p>一個羅曼斯的故事，常常很能動人情感。這裏就是一部從羅曼蒂克的小說改編的電影，由於約翰羅伯孫（Ｊohn　Ｒobettson)優秀的導演手法，具體的用畫面表現出來，其感人的力量，確是很深刻動人的。</p>
<p>無疑的，這裏最好的是導演的手法。尤其是他對於情調與空氣的處理。他大部份都不用音樂帮助畫面，但是主要的塲合，却是音樂有力的助長了劇情，（不是外加的音樂，而是劇中應有的音響效果）費履甫逃獄出來，月夜訪女時的鋼琴聲，如費履甫使女兒和情人會面時的蓄音機，都是極好的表現。是的，導演對於劇的調子，把握得極好，自開始至結尾，他都在靜的氛圍中展開人生悒鬰的苦味，而費履甫逃獄的當時，那急促的雨聲中的緊急而敏捷的動作，如此描寫的力量，確是其他影片中不可多得的。</p>
<p>也許說假使主角李却迪克斯（ＲichardＤix）所飾的費履甫，做得太理智了，不够加厚劇的情感。對的，這未嘗不是這一影片的損失。但是這始終是没有現實性的羅曼斯，卽使說它很有情感，然而這對於一般要求電影現實表現的觀衆們，到底不免感覺空虚的。</p>
<h3 id="c316">評（神秘古鐘） <a href="#c316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>Ｂeiore　Ｍidnight丨南京映</p>
<p>在偵探影片上披着一件神秘的外衣丨如過去不久的（龍潭寳鑰）·（十三個女性）和現在這張（神秘古鐘）等，這種事實，除了說明那些逃避現實，和中國許多舊小說中的（山窮水盡，神仙搭救）·等荒唐無稽外，所不同的，只是一邊在（當塲出彩），一邊是先設下一個氛圍，故弄虚玄地開展下去。</p>
<p>想用所謂神秘來彌補不通的故事，這張（神秘古鐘），欲蓋彌彰，不通之處，依然很多。首先如作爲這影片中心的暗殺案件主要人物的關係上，就不近事實。是的，糜爛生活的人們，因着愛情或其他醜惡的糾紛，更姓改名，原是平常的事情，可是爲了恐怕自已的私生子女知道自已的醜事，而改换姓名，以致引起財產上的糾紛，演成這樣的慘案，却未免太牽强了。</p>
<p>自然，其中如在富商亞氏被殺後，作者使秘書，秘書之妻，養女琴綺，顧問醫生馬西，侍者日本人古諾，信用動摇之銀行家葛翰，甚至於女婢等，多蒙上有殺人的嫌疑，在關係與氛圍上，還擺佈得不太壞。其實要能在結構上更精密些，又何必定要用什麽神秘的古鐘來做　子呢？</p>
<p>在演出方面看來，導演Ｌambert　Ｈillyer雖然相當的用心。可是山於劇本本身的缺憾，終於未能脫却一般平庸偵探片的窠臼。其中作爲劇情展開上的重要疑雲，同時也是案件解决上的重要關鍵的戰塲，如富拉的老婆在黑夜中潛入亞氏臥室，滴遇律師施密士在竊取一個女子的日記，古諾在室外偷聽。古諾被偵探迫得正想吐露實情，忽爲飛刀所殺，以及秘書把那日記交給老婆時，偵探吊在窗外窺視等地方，製作者用極大的努力來拚命佈置緊張與恐怖的空氣，固然可以抓住觀衆片時的注意，可是較高明的觀衆自會知道這僅是一般偵探片中的俗套與老調兒。</p>
<p>全片光綫較暗，夜間的塲面特别多。這種利用攝影的技術以陰影，暗角，雨急，電閃等增加疑點與恐怖，也是偵探片慣用了的（看家法寳）。</p>
<p>演員中，飾偵探的Ｒalph　Ｂellamy，演得僅僅稱職，剛健還够，智謀沉着却嫌不足。演秘書富拉的Ｃlaude　Ｇillingwatei那種身爲殺人犯而苦無其事的態度頗够。Ｒetly　Ｂlyche的秘書之妻，也很好。</p>

<p>康妮本來是嚶嚶啜泣的，但是等到迭倫進了臥室，將門碰上了之後，她亦不哭了，肩膀亦不聳動起伏了。她的頭從她捧着的雙手之中，抬了起來，向着迭倫的臥房嫣然一笑，臉上一些涙痕都没有。她心想一不作，二不休主索興來裝作一下。她於是慢慢地在地板上躺　下去，將自已的衣裙在地上舖好了。她順手將檯上的一杯水打　了，使水從檯上流了下來。等到一切都佈置好了，她就伸出手來，將檯上的一隻檯燈，望自已身旁一拉。祇聽見花拉一聲，那座檯燈就摔在地上了。她閉着眼睛，躺在地板上，聽見　的一聲，臥房門開了······迭倫奔了出來，急速的走到她的身旁。她狠命地忍住了笑，咬緊了牙，伸直了她的迷人的嘴角············</p>
<p>到了明天早晨，歇伯和傑弗雷在飯店的房間醒了過來。他們覺得神經昏昏然。傑弗雷不久就蘇醒了過來。他猛然想起了昨天晚上的童男子的聚餐會。他又想起了迭倫竟没有到會。霍的一下子，他從床上跳了下來。這個時候，飯店裏的經理，副經理等正打着他們的房門，來和他們辦交涉，因爲他們在浴室裏，開了一晚上的水管子，以及洪水橫流，流到下面，兩層樓板都浸壞了，要他們賠償損失。</p>
<p>傑弗雷心想他那裏管得了這許多事，他還有比天還大的事情要做哩。曼麗今天下午要結婚的，現在已經鐘鳴十一下了。他下了床，立即走到電話跟前叫着一家花店的電話號碼。這是歇伯還躺在床上，宿醒未醒，眼睛半張半閻地問道：（你做什麽）？傑弗雷道：（從我們一點兒大起，曼麗鼎喜歡的，就是玉米花。今天是她結婚的日子，我至少應當送她些玉米花。他們有多少玉米花，我全都買了來，送給曼麗去······）。</p>
<p>到了下午，花店裏將許許多多的玉米花，都送到曼麗家裏去了。在她的修裝室裏，許多伴娘和葆拉等，都在曼麗的四週忙着。曼麗對着這許多玉米花，笑着說道；（迭倫眞有良心，送了這許多玉米花來。我在小時候，喜歡睡在玉米花裏面的······我曾說過，我將來結婚，亦要穿着玉米花的衣服結婚的。虧得迭倫好記心，他還想得起來。）</p>
<p>不錯，迭倫是有記心的。他什麽都記得，就是一樣，他忘記了到禮拜堂去。親戚朋友都到了。禮拜堂裏的座位，都坐满了。臺上的唱歌班，都唱了半天歌，喉嚨都要唱啞了。大家頸　子伸得都酸了望新郎來，但是新郎却不知那裏去了。賓客們坐着漸漸覺得詫異不安起來。傑弗雷奔了出去，到迭倫的寓所裏，去看看到底怎麽回事。不久，他回來了。曼麗苦笑着迎着他。傑弗雷的臉呈露着灰白色。他差不多不知道怎麽了好。他差不多話都說不出來了。他抓住了曼麗的臂膊說道：（曼麗······我······）。</p>
<p>曼麗知道事情有些蹊蹺，她的臉色亦嚇得變了。她連忙問道：（怎麽啦？他病了······他······）傑弗雷道：（曼麗······他已經結了婚了······）曼麗亦跟着道：（結了婚了？）葆拉在一旁插嘴道：（他和誰結婚了）？歇伯說道，（和康妮巴尼司！）大家於是都看着曼麗。她還勉强問着傑弗雷道：（你不是和我開玩笑吧。告訴我眞話······不要逗我了······）。（未完）</p>

After looting, the bandits forced over 70 men and women from the village to join their ranks to transport the stolen goods, driving them towards the Jieshangkou pass to escape. Upon receiving the report, Wang Buyuan, commander of the 1st Security Brigade, led his troops in pursuit. The bandits crossed the river and, taking advantage of the dense fog, looted Liuguan Village. On the morning of the 14th, they were caught up with by the security forces and engaged in a fierce battle for three hours outside the village. The bandits drove the male hostages ahead of them as a shield to break out, and then fled towards the pass. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>

He also stated regarding what the construction is being used for, “I have visited the site, but I am unsure.

If it is not maintained, the Yellow River will change course, creating a great danger. In addition, the telegram stated that the Guantai Dike plugging project is difficult. The breach is over 13 meters deep, and the flow rate is over 600 cubic meters per second. Despite round-the-clock efforts, the current is swift and the water is deep, and the supply of soil and materials is difficult, so the situation is deteriorating. Freezing is imminent, and if there is further ice accumulation, the impact and vibration will not only threaten to change the course of the Yellow River, but the entire city of Changyuan County will also be submerged. Please devise a plan to raise funds and allocate large amounts of relief money to save the victims. Resolved: Handed over to the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee.

<h3 id="e16">Hunanese Members of the Central Committee Propose Measures to Relieve the Hunan Disaster <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Qi, He Yaozu, Deng Feihuang, Xiao Zhongzhen, and other members of the Central Committee from Hunan proposed that the drought disaster in Hunan Province is extremely severe. Farmers are freezing to death and committing suicide everywhere. A total of 69 counties in southern Hunan have been affected by the disaster, with 31 counties being most severely affected, and over 13 million people have been affected. Losses include approximately 500,000 shi of rice and 8 million shi of miscellaneous grains. Moreover, over 100,000 fierce bandits have poured into southern Hunan from Jiangxi. With Xiao Ke ravaging the area before and Zhu and Mao causing chaos afterward, homes have been turned into ruins. Although the main force of the communist bandits has left southern Hunan, scattered bandits are still roaming throughout the area. The counties in western Hunan have recently suffered from bandit raids, and rice and salt have been looted. Drought and bandits have arrived at the same time. The old and weak are sitting and waiting to die, and the young and strong are taking risks. The bandit scourge is growing, and the military and financial resources expended will be ten or a hundred times greater than they are now, while the sacrifices of the local areas and the people will be unimaginable. For the sake of overall security and national defense, the central government must find ways to relieve the Hunanese victims and provide them with a stable life to avoid a major burden on the country. Therefore, they proposed three measures: (1) Request the central government to designate collateral to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds for Hunan disaster relief. If it is not easy to designate collateral temporarily, please use the central government's due repayment of over 7.44 million yuan in Hunan's rice and salt public shares as collateral to issue public bonds, which is easier to implement. (This public share is the fund for the construction of the Hunan-Hubei Railway, and the Hunan-Hubei section should be used as collateral.) (2) Request the central government to follow the precedent of the Xinhai water disaster and add a 20% surtax on customs duties for drought disaster relief. During the water disaster in various provinces in the year Xinhai, the central government lent American wheat for relief and added a surtax to customs duties for several years to repay the American wheat loan. The current drought disaster in Hunan is even more severe than the water disaster in the year Xinhai. Our country's customs duties are now autonomous, and we should follow the precedent of the Xinhai water disaster and add a 20% surtax for drought disaster relief to fund relief efforts. If the surtax period for the Xinhai water disaster has not yet expired, please extend it by one to three years to defer the repayment of the American wheat loan. (3) Request the central government to return the 7.44 million yuan in rice and salt public shares owed to Hunan. The rice and salt public shares were to be paid off by the central government over 24 years from 1916. In 1917, the shares were exchanged for Class B transportation certificates. The Beijing government repaid over 600,000 yuan in the middle, but as of the end of 1926, the principal and interest still amounted to 7,445,004.27 yuan. The Hunan provincial government has repeatedly requested repayment, but it has been delayed until now due to insufficient funds. Now that the Hunan-Hubei Railway has been open to traffic for a long time and the Zhushao section is about to be completed, the road rights have been nationalized, and the road shares should be returned to the people of Hunan following the precedent of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. This type of funds should be used to organize work relief. Representatives from Hunan, Liu Fucheng and Zhou Anhan, as well as Chuan Dingxiang, the representative who originally signed the contract with the Ministry of Transportation, have come to Nanjing one after another, describing the disaster situation. Therefore, the proposal is made to the congress to consider the huge disaster in Hunan, to quickly deliberate and select a method, and to hand it over to the Executive Yuan to allocate large amounts of funds to implement relief, or to create important factories and organize cooperative undertakings, and to ask the central government to send personnel to preside over and supervise the local gentry to handle the matter, so as to ensure that the victims receive real benefits, construction undertakings can be promoted, and the bandit scourge can be eliminated invisibly. The Central Political Council can submit it for discussion on the 16th. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Concerning the Saar Region's Return to Germany <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>By Heng</p>
<p>According to recent foreign dispatches, the Saar plebiscite has concluded with a victory for Germany, securing 477,119 votes. This outcome aligns with our expectations. The League of Nations has governed the Saar for fifteen years, and its measures, broadly speaking, have been quite enlightened. Freedoms such as assembly, association, education, language, writing, nationality, and religion have generally been respected. For a region governed by others, this level of freedom is, objectively speaking, a reasonably satisfactory form of governance. However, the voting results show that this region will ultimately return to Germany. This is primarily due to the paramount importance of national sentiment. Every nation in the world desires independence and autonomy. Being governed by others, no matter how enlightened or fortunate, is ultimately perceived as a great humiliation in the national consciousness. Therefore, the Saar's return to Germany is an inevitable fact and not surprising.</p>
<p>Previously, some international affairs analysts speculated that, given the German political situation, the Saar plebiscite might maintain the status quo. Their reasoning was based on the fact that since Hitler came to power in Germany, many dissidents had fled to the Saar. Furthermore, Catholics constituted a significant majority in the Saar, and their feelings towards Hitler were not amicable. If they collectively voted to maintain the status quo, the overall outcome would be uncertain. However, these German exiles advocating for maintaining the status quo, as well as the Socialists and Communists, constituted only a minority of the population. Secondly, the Catholic Church, through repeated notices from the Pope, instructed followers not to let religious grievances interfere with their conscientious choices. Therefore, there was no anti-German propaganda campaign. At the same time, Catholics feared that if Germany failed, they would be blamed and retaliated against, so they were even less inclined to support the anti-German faction. With Catholics abandoning their stance of maintaining the status quo, the Saar's return to Germany was never in question.</p>
<p>The Saar's return to Germany is now procedurally complete. The remaining issues to be resolved are: (1) How to raise funds to reclaim the mineral resources in the area; (2) How to protect those in the region who advocated for maintaining the status quo. These two issues were partially addressed in the Franco-German agreement of December 3rd of last year. The former issue involves Germany raising 900 million francs to redeem the mineral resources. However, whether Germany can pay within a year remains questionable. Regarding the latter issue, the agreement stipulated that Germany should ensure the safety of those who voted against returning to Germany. However, in reality, the National Socialist Party has special methods of dealing with such individuals. Therefore, whether this provision will be merely symbolic remains uncertain. If these two issues are not properly resolved, the Saar's return to Germany may not be fully realized in the short term. Even if it does return, the specific terms and conditions, both complete and partial, are still subject to the League of Nations Administrative Council's decision. Therefore, it cannot be said that everything is settled after the vote.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the German perspective, according to a Reuter's dispatch yesterday, the German people seemed rather indifferent to the Saar plebiscite. When the authorities ordered people to wear lapel flowers, less than one-tenth complied. Even fewer hung flags to celebrate. Their enthusiasm was far less than that of government officials. This phenomenon seems quite peculiar at first glance, but upon closer inspection, the reason is quite ordinary. According to the treaty, the Saar's return was originally supposed to occur after fifteen years. When Hitler came to power, he directly negotiated with France to return the Saar early, without requiring a plebiscite. This request was rejected by France. Therefore, today's plebiscite is purely the result of the fifteen-year term expiring. There was no acceleration in time, nor any concessions gained in redeeming the mineral resources. Everything was done according to the treaty. Therefore, the Germans view the victory of this Saar plebiscite as a matter of course, with not a trace of luck involved. The reason for the lack of overwhelming enthusiasm may be this. However, according to today's news, when the Germans heard the news of the plebiscite victory, they were overjoyed and shouted with joy, like fathers and sons, brothers reuniting after a long separation, filled with joyful tears, which is also a very normal thing.</p>

Rumors that Tianjin will be developed as a commercial city, expanding its municipal area, are unfounded. The Tianjin Municipal Government has established a health bureau to handle the city's health administration and directly collect health taxes. This is the prelude to establishing a health bureau. The original health office of the Municipal Government still exists but only handles design and construction matters. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>

<p>Pro-Return Votes Account for Ninety Percent; Fifteen Years of Lost Territory Recovered in One Day; German People Rejoice and the Whole Country is Ecstatic</p>
<p>The final results of the Saar plebiscite in Saarbrücken were officially announced this morning. The number of votes in favor of returning to Germany exceeded even the expectations of German leaders. The official final vote count is as follows: 477,119 votes in favor of returning to Germany, 46,513 votes in favor of maintaining the status quo, and 2,124 votes in favor of returning to France.</p>
<p>Calculated as a percentage of the total vote:</p>
<p>90.36% in favor of returning to Germany, 8.81% in favor of maintaining the status quo, and 0.40% in favor of returning to France.</p>
<p>Although voters were scattered far and wide, very few Saarlanders with voting rights abstained. The total number of registered voters was 539,541, of whom 528,005 actually voted, with only 11,536 abstaining.</p>
<p>After the official results were announced at the Warteberg Hall, the people of the Saar cast aside all the restrictions imposed during the voting period and celebrated the return of their lost territory to the motherland with a unanimous voice of joy. Tens of thousands of people came out to celebrate, and swastika flags could be seen fluttering everywhere in the freezing wind. Homes were brightly lit with candles, and the bells of churches rang throughout the region. Hundreds of residents along the border rushed into Germany to express their intention to return to their rightful owners. Although the minority was overshadowed by this universal celebration, they were unwilling to remain silent. Saar Social Democratic leader Blum also convened an anti-Hitler demonstration. According to the results of this vote, the rural areas almost unanimously favored returning to Germany, while the industrial areas favored maintaining the status quo. (Fifteenth National Telegraph Dispatch)</p>
<p>The German victory in the Saar plebiscite in Saarbrücken was expected, but the number of votes it received was surprising. It was generally believed that if the number of votes in favor of returning to Germany was less than 85 percent, it would be a blow to Hitlerism. Today's results indicate an undeniable victory for the National Socialist Party. There were many spectators in the Warteberg Hall during the vote counting, but not many people gathered outside because of the cold weather. (Fifteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>German Führer Hitler declared tonight that after the Saar's return to Germany, Germany will no longer have any territorial disputes with France. Hitler also said that people of the same race and culture expressed their judgment with one voice. There is no greater honor for us than this. Today, I represent all German people in expressing our gratitude. Today, I cannot help but say that we will never hinder the unity of all nations, and we are also determined to create equality for all nations. People of the Saar, you can be said to be worthy of being German. Tens of millions of Germans thank you and welcome you back to a unified Germany, and so on. (Fifteenth National Telegraph Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) All of Germany is celebrating the Saar's great victory today. National flags are flying throughout the city, and all private residences, trams, and automobiles are decorated with flags to celebrate. Workers in factories and employees in businesses gathered in front of radios to listen to the results of the plebiscite. They only started working after learning the results. Schools across the country also broadcast the good news by radio. After hearing the good news, German Führer Hitler issued a radio address, welcoming the people of the Saar back to Germany, saying that the shame of the past few years has now ended. The joy of the Saar's return is the joy of all German people. The people of the Saar have been strong and patient in the past fifteen years, which is commendable. He also hoped that they would continue to maintain discipline in the future. He also said that we are determined to safeguard world peace. Now that the Saar has returned, Germany no longer has any territorial demands on France. Although Germany seeks equality and security, it is also willing to facilitate the unity of all nations. After Hitler's speech, it was followed by a hymn praising God, then the Saar anthem, and finally the ringing of church bells throughout Germany. Churches were ordered by the Minister of the Interior to ring their bells for one hour from noon to 1:00 PM. (Fifteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Commissioner for Saar Affairs Josef Bürckel gave a speech when the results of the plebiscite were announced, congratulating Führer and Chancellor Hitler, saying that "The Saar people's vote in favor of returning to the motherland by 90.5 percent indicates that the people's desire to end the millennia-long unrest is self-evident. The Rhine River is not the border of Germany, but its inner river. The Saar people's desire to merge with the German motherland and their faith in Germany has been clearly demonstrated. Hitler, you are Germany, you are the protector of the children of the fatherland." After Bürckel's speech, Hitler gave a reply, saying that the injustice of the past fifteen years has now come to an end, and the suffering of our Saar compatriots has also come to an end. Today's joy of the Saar people is also the joy of the German people. Hitler then recounted the injustice of the Treaty of Versailles and praised the courage and loyalty of the Saar people. He then said, "The tension in Europe has now disappeared. The disputes in Europe for the past twenty years have been resolved in one fell swoop. Therefore, January 13th is a memorable day. Since the Saar people have made this decision, I dare to solemnly declare that after the Saar returns to Germany, we will no longer have any territorial demands on France. We want Germany to obtain equality of rights, but we also want to realize the solidarity of all nations." Then, Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech, saying, "Hundreds of thousands of people in the Saar, regardless of gender, class, or occupation, have shown their patriotic fervor, resulting in Germany's victory in the fifteen-year dispute. This is something that we German people should never forget for generations to come." On this day, all German schools and public institutions hung flags to celebrate. The Christian and Catholic authorities ordered all churches to ring their bells for one hour. In addition, the entire nation was asked to hang national flags, so that within half an hour, the entire country was covered in flags. German universities will hold celebrations, and there will be large-scale demonstrations in public places across the country, praising the patriotism and loyalty of the Saar people.

<p>(Paris) In light of the clear voting results, the French government today advocated returning the Saar to Germany immediately, but recognized that the rights of the anti-Hitler minority should still be protected.

From now on, the two countries can cooperate for peace in Europe, and so on. (Fifteenth National Telegraph Dispatch)</p>

It is gratifying that the plebiscite held in the Saar region has been conducted strictly in accordance with the treaty. The French people will not raise any objections to the voting results." Prime Minister Flandin then described the League of Nations' contribution to maintaining peace and said that he hoped that all issues that hinder the improvement of relations between France and Germany could be resolved quickly under the leadership of the League of Nations. The issue of relocating Saar residents to other countries is significant and closely related to the League of Nations, as the League of Nations should protect opponents of Hitler to prevent retaliation. Prime Minister Flandin, while deeply confident that the German government will respect the rights of minorities, still stated that the French government has paid attention to this matter and organized an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Minister without Portfolio Herriot to draft a plan.

The British government believes that the League of Nations Administrative Council no longer needs to discuss the status quo issue because the number of votes in favor of returning to Germany is so large.

<h3 id="e44">League of Nations Committee Meeting; Advocates Returning Sovereignty of the Saar Region to Germany; Awaiting Final Decision from Administrative Council Meeting <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations Saar Committee met, chaired by Italian Aloisi, and decided in principle to advocate returning the Saar to Germany. The full text of the resolution will be submitted to the League of Nations Administrative Council tomorrow. Although Germany's victory was expected by most people, the governments of European countries were all surprised by the majority that Germany obtained in the vote. People in League of Nations circles in Geneva were deeply relieved by the voting results because the number of anti-German votes was quite small, and the final obstacle to returning all the territory to Germany was no longer a concern. Initially, some people feared that if the number of votes against Germany was more than expected, the Saar might be divided. Now, they are all relieved. French newspapers have expressed their satisfaction with Germany's large majority in the vote, saying that it can avoid all kinds of terrible entanglements and hoping that the defeated minority will not put up any major resistance to oppose the will of the victorious majority.

<p>(Geneva) This morning, the League of Nations Administrative Council held a non-public meeting for a short time and immediately reviewed the results of the Saar plebiscite and decided to convene a three-person committee to meet in the afternoon to draft a report to be submitted on Thursday or Friday. Then, the Administrative Council will announce the transfer of sovereignty over the Saar region. League of Nations officials have adopted a calm attitude toward the voting results and mostly believe that the number of votes obtained by those who supported maintaining the status quo was less than expected. They believe that, objectively speaking, the results of this vote were similar to the plebiscites conducted by the German National Socialist government in the past two years. (Note: After Germany withdrew from the League of Nations in 1933, the National Socialist government held plebiscites on domestic and foreign policy to gauge public opinion. After the death of President Hindenburg last year, another plebiscite was held to gauge public support for Hitler's concurrent position as "Führer.") In short, the Saar people did not forget their motherland, and their vote in favor of returning to Germany was due to patriotic psychological reasons. As for whether the National Socialist government should be praised, it is not a matter of concern. However, although the fate of the Saar region has been decided, there are still several political, economic, and financial issues that need to be resolved by the Administrative Council. Specifically, (1) in reference to the resolution passed by the Administrative Council on December 5 of last year, specify the date of transfer of sovereignty over the Saar. According to this resolution, if the voting results decide to return to Germany, the transition period should be at least one month; (2) specify the expiration date of the terms of office of the plebiscite committee and the Saar Administrative Committee; (3) specify the date of withdrawal of international troops. Most of the decisions that the Administrative Council should take on the above matters will depend on the attitude of the Saar officials and people. As for financial and economic issues, the most important are (1) the French franc circulating in the Saar should be recovered with the mark; (2) the future management system of the Saar mines. Regarding these two aspects, the three-person committee specified the outline of the solution last year, and now it should be completed by the Administrative Council. The three-person committee will hold a meeting in a location in northern Italy in the near future, and these issues should be easily resolved. In addition, there is one more issue, namely, according to the Treaty of Versailles, the Saar region is within a demilitarized zone. The French government has not forgotten this, and the Administrative Council should also pay attention to it. (Fifteenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Politics and Economics: Hundreds of Matters Awaiting Governance <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>With the Saar plebiscite now concluded, one of the most significant chapters of the post-war era has come to an end. The Saar region's mining area, with the northern part being the most important, was largely destroyed during the European War. The Treaty of Versailles, as compensation to France, designated all mineral resources within the Saar as the property of the French state, without any restrictions. The Saar territory was placed under a special system, administered by an administrative committee organized by the League of Nations. French customs regulations were also implemented in the Saar. The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that fifteen years after the treaty came into effect, the people of the Saar would hold a vote to determine their desired sovereignty, namely (1) maintaining the status quo, (2) merging with France, or (3) returning to Germany. The plebiscite held on the 13th of this month was in implementation of this clause. However, as the Saar's mineral resources were owned by France, the treaty also stipulated how to proceed if the voting result was for the Saar territory to return to Germany: Germany would be required to redeem the mineral resources from the French government at a price. The League of Nations would be responsible for handling the agreements needed for the redemption of mineral resources and the transfer of local administrative power. The League of Nations appointed a three-person committee (chaired by Italian representative Aloisi) last year to prepare for the plebiscite and its associated issues. Regarding the various economic and legal issues arising after the Saar's return to Germany, French and German diplomatic representatives signed an agreement in Rome on December 3 of last year. The members of the three-person committee, chaired by Aloisi, were also present at the signing. This agreement stipulated that Germany should pay a total of 900,000,000 francs to redeem the French state-owned coal mines and three railways built by France. In addition to this, the coal mine concessionaire of Warndt should deliver coal to France. The Warndt mine wells are located within France, but the mineral resources are underground in the Saar territory. Regardless of who the operator is, the mine should deliver a certain amount of coal to France each year within five years after the Saar's return to Germany, not exceeding 2.2 million tons per year, totaling 11 million tons over five years. It is estimated that this coal is worth 45 million francs over five years, which is what the French government should receive in addition to the 900 million francs. The Rome agreement also stipulated the payment method: the German government should redeem French banknotes circulating in the Saar with marks, and most of the payment to France would be made with these redeemed banknotes. If there is any remaining balance after the initial five-year period, France will continue to extract coal from the Warndt mine, and the debt owed by Germany to France will be deducted accordingly. Regarding political issues, the German representative had previously stated to Aloisi, the chairman of the three-person committee, that if the Saar returned to Germany, the Third Reich's various laws regarding religion and race would not be implemented in the Saar region for at least one year. This statement was reiterated by the German representative in Rome. In addition, various measures were stipulated to allow Saar residents who wished to leave the Saar to freely exit with their property. Finally, we can briefly describe the quantity of Saar mineral resources: in 1934, Saar coal production reached 11.3 million tons. In 1913, under German administration, it had produced 13.2 million tons, which then gradually decreased, falling to 9 million tons by 1919. By 1924, it reached 14.032 million tons, which was the highest number. The French mining administration had adopted a method of extracting metallurgical coking coal from Saar coal, which was previously unsuitable for this purpose. This new invention was considered particularly beneficial in a place where the steel industry was especially developed and close to the iron mines of the French Lorraine province.

<p>The ballot counting work in Saarbrücken began at 5:10 PM yesterday. British soldiers from the international peacekeeping force guarded the inside and outside of the counting place. No one was allowed to enter without two special certificates and a passport. Before entering, they still had to be inspected. A French journalist was excluded for refusing inspection. In the hall of the counting place, sixty tables were set up, with six vote counters sitting at each table. In front of them was a ballot box. During the counting, the plebiscite commission had to sit under the arc lamps. Journalists sat in the audience seats on both sides and took photos of them. Among the guests were International Peacekeeping Force Commander Major General Brian and his staff. At the beginning of the counting, the chairman of the plebiscite commission, Lord, gave a brief speech to warn the vote counters that their responsibility was heavy, and then declared, "The counting can begin now." The vote counters then opened the ballot boxes in front of them, removed all the green-sealed ballots, and placed them on the tables in an orderly manner. The piles of ballots advocating the return of the territory to Germany piled up higher and higher on one table, while the piles of ballots advocating maintaining the status quo piled up on the table were far fewer than the former, but were also gradually increasing. The Saar people did not seem very concerned about the counting, as only about a hundred people gathered outside the counting place. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>The ballot counting was handled in the Wardburg Building, working overnight. By 5:20 AM, all the ballots had been completely counted. From 1 AM onwards, the Dutch member of the public voting commission issued a declaration by radio, saying that the committee could announce the voting results at the specified time and asked all radio listeners to listen to the radio report at 5 AM (German time). After midnight, the number of visitors to the counting place had decreased, but there were still some people who were working hard, maintaining order with the Swedish, Dutch, and British soldiers at the scene.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>At dawn, there were several other British soldiers in the next room, all with sleeves rolled up, playing cards together. Some were playing the accordion and singing. Only a few British soldiers could be seen at the scene, carrying ballot boxes and large stacks of stamped ballot papers, delivering them to the vote counters' desks. The foreign representatives sat around the stage, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious. However, some opponents of the Saar's annexation to Germany, seeing that the counting results were gradually in favor of Germany, could not help but feel uneasy. By dawn, the counting of ballots had been completed, but it still had to be reviewed once. The vote counters looked tired because they had not slept all night. Although it was extremely tense yesterday, it changed to tranquility at this time. Only the British soldiers on guard, because they had taken turns sleeping at night, paid attention to the progress of this major historical event all night without fatigue. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Before the results were announced this morning in the Saar, there was a sudden alarming rumor: after the commander of the Saar International Police and the local police chief went to the Walterburg barracks, it was rumored that some police officers with communist leanings were plotting a coup. But because the plot was revealed, the two masterminds had fled into France. Those who heard about it were shocked. However, after the police commander stated that his visit to the barracks was purely for the purpose of inspecting the barracks, people's minds were calmed. However, the possibility of disturbance has not completely ceased. In the afternoon, the police began to arrest communists, and 16 people have been arrested. It is reported that some weapons were found in their rooms. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Saarbrücken Yesterday night, an incident occurred in the police barracks of Saarbrücken City, Saarbrücken. Police officers who advocated maintaining the status quo, fearing that the plebiscite results might be unfavorable, caused disturbances, resulting in a conflict with police officers affiliated with the German Front Group. It was pacified by the intervention of the police chief. At that time, the police in the camp were temporarily disarmed, but the weapons were returned soon after. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the conflict that occurred in the Saar district police barracks last night, the German News Agency issued a special publication at 2:15 AM this morning, saying that the Saarbrücken City Police Department learned last night that a German fugitive named Machzi had gathered 120 people to organize a special team aimed at splitting the Saar region into two parts, one part belonging to Germany and the other part maintaining the status quo. The German News Agency used this as an excuse to launch a strong attack on Knox, the chairman of the Saar Administrative Committee, accusing him of deliberately condoning (fugitives) to serve as police officers, causing the incident last night.

<p>Considering the Lifting of Military Clauses in the Treaty, Britain, France, and Italy Will Strive to Find a Way. French Authorities Plan to Visit London at the End of This Month</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet held an important meeting last night to discuss the international situation. It is expected that there will be new developments in European political circles. Soon, Britain and other countries will contact Germany, aiming to have Germany rejoin the League of Nations and participate in a disarmament convention. It is believed that the British Cabinet expressed the opinion at the meeting that the current time is very good, and it is advisable to find a way to seek a general European disarmament agreement again. When French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval come to England at the end of next week to consult with the British Foreign Minister and others, they will review the entire issue. It is expected that Britain, France, and Italy will strive to find a way to mutually agree to abolish the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles that Germany is most dissatisfied with. However, this method must be attached to the following understandings: (1) Germany rejoins the League of Nations, (2) Germany joins an international convention restricting armaments. According to the phenomenon, the French government now has a more hopeful attitude towards security issues. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval are scheduled to travel from Paris to London on the 25th to consult with British government authorities on European peace work. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) How to get Germany to rejoin the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference is one of the main issues currently being considered by the British government. However, Britain is deeply willing to act only after obtaining France's close agreement. Therefore, British policy must wait until Foreign Minister Simon and French Foreign Minister Laval exchange views in London before making a final decision. The British Cabinet will hold a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday to learn about the results of the Saar plebiscite. If the Saar does indeed merge with Germany as a result of the plebiscite, Britain advocates immediately raising the issue of Germany rejoining Geneva without delay. Britain believes that Germany's return to Geneva is an element of European appeasement, and it is especially necessary after the signing of the Rome Agreement and the resolution of the Saar issue. Therefore, experts from the British Foreign Office suggested that the victorious countries of the last war return to the League of Nations the various military benefits obtained from the Treaty of Versailles. (According to their meaning, they refer to the abolition of the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles.) At the same time, the defeated countries are allowed to request the League of Nations to enjoy the benefits of abolishing these clauses, on the condition that the defeated country joins the League of Nations. The British Cabinet is paying close attention to this plan. However, regardless of the method used, if Germany returns to Geneva, Britain believes that negotiations should be held immediately on a convention restricting armaments. If so, the issue of restricting the use of bombers can be raised for re-discussion.</p>
<p>Discussion, and the Locarno Treaty can also be re-interpreted on the issue of sky safety. If the above issues are raised during the talks between Britain and France in London this month, Britain may express its sincerity in cooperating with the continental countries. However, this cooperation is still limited, because Britain cannot only sign new conventions in the continental area, but also reduce the scope of participation in various forms of international sanctions as much as possible.

<p>Claiming 90% Success</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo citizen Haruji Hatogahara has now completed the invention of a device to prevent the sound of aircraft propellers. The army plans to send General Watanabe and Major General Ishii of the Chemical Research Institute to attend the practical test at the Sozawa area in the afternoon of the 18th. It is said that Hatogahara has spent a lot of effort on this silencer since last year. The results of the test with an Apro 120 horsepower show that it can indeed prevent explosion sounds by up to 90%. It is now apparent that the army sound detectors, which were originally designed to listen to aircraft sounds to detect enemy aircraft attacks, have very limited function. This silencer can be said to be a landmark achievement in national defense, and the general public is paying close attention to it. According to Kajihara, the director of Sozawa Aviation Institute: If this machine is successful, sound detectors will be unnecessary, and it can be said to be the world's greatest invention. It is said that 90% success has been achieved so far. If we continue to work hard from now on, we can reach a perfect state, which is what we hope for. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>But Not Expelled from the Party</p>
<p>(Moscow) Since the assassination of Kirov, there has been a major purge here again. Former Communist Party leaders Kamenev and Zinoviev and many other lesser-known figures were exiled today. It is estimated that 15% to 20% of Communist Party members have been expelled from the party. However, although Kamenev and Zinoviev have been exiled, they have not been expelled from the party. According to the authorities, this purge is due to three needs: (1) to eliminate elements with counter-revolutionary tendencies, (2) to re-purge party members who have joined the opposition of Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Trotsky, and (3) to eliminate party members who express indifference to the Kirov assassination. In addition, Kolundo, vice chairman of the People's Committee of the Belarusian Republic and chairman of the Design Committee, was also expelled from the party. Izvestia reported on this matter, saying that an agency had been uncovered there, which was related to a foreign Pan-Faction and secretly preparing for foreign intervention. In addition, it was heard that the public organs of the two cities of Kiev and Kharkov have also become nests of counter-revolutionaries, but they have no influence in the public.

<h3 id="e55">US Silver Faction Activities <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, all parties in the Washington Congress are paying attention to the currency inflation conference convened by Democratic Senator Thomas, the leader of the inflation faction, to be held on Wednesday. It is said that Democratic Congressman Martin, the leader of the House of Representatives silver faction, also intends to draft his silver proposal after hearing the results of the conference. Congressman Fessinger may make slight modifications to the bill he proposed in the last House of Representatives Currency Committee and propose it again. The content of the proposal is that the government manipulates the purchase of silver to maintain the price balance of 1926. Although Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that the government has no intention of changing or abolishing the 1934 Silver Purchase Act, congressional silver faction leaders still said that the Treasury Secretary is not doing enough to purchase silver. Democratic Senator Wheeler told the Associated Press that the Senate Agriculture Committee will have a favorable report on his proposal to re-establish silver as the US dollar standard at a ratio of 16 to 1 with gold. This report can be submitted to the Senate as soon as there are no other political issues. Webster also said that the attitude of the Treasury Department has made them deeply feel the need to establish mandatory legislation on the silver issue, because the Treasury Department does not sympathize with the silver purchase plan. According to silver faction estimates, the Treasury Department still needs to purchase at least 1.1 billion ounces of silver to meet the legal silver reserve requirements. It is difficult for diplomatic circles to know for sure where the United States can purchase such a large amount of silver. Some diplomats expect that the Treasury Department will re-purchase from silver-producing countries when necessary, rather than starting from silver-using countries. Generally speaking, Mexico may be the best market. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The panic that the Supreme Court's ruling on the gold clause (test case) will be unfavorable to the government is even more serious today. It is learned that the judges have now begun to study the 1929 ruling of the International Court of Justice on the dispute over the gold clause in Brazilian public bonds. The ruling claimed that Brazilian securities must have a gold clause, and the gold component of the currency paid back must be equal to the component at the time of issuance of the securities. The judges probably attach great importance to this ruling, because the many copies in the Library of Congress have been completely collected, and they are not enough to use. There are no other collections across the country, and a telegram has now been sent to Europe to order them. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said today that the Treasury Department has begun to study the steps to be taken after an unfavorable ruling, but he is unwilling to discuss what the steps are. Speaker of the House of Representatives Bernes predicted that the Supreme Court will rule to abolish the gold clause, because its relationship to the country is too great, and even if the ruling is unfavorable, the legislative side can find ways to remedy it. However, generally expanding the number of judges and increasing the number of judges who sympathize with the New Deal is something that the country cannot agree to. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>New York: Factors favoring market conditions before the opening of the New York securities market were: (1) continued increase in steel mill activity; (2) the panic over the gold clause case is gradually subsiding. The market is showing signs of increased buying. Factors unfavorable to market conditions are that the securities market may tend to stagnate until the Supreme Court decides on the gold clause case. This morning, security prices opened mixed, but the trend was mostly upward. However, speculators are unwilling to take action before the Supreme Court rules on the gold clause case, so the market seems likely to remain quiet without much change. Prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Frequent personnel changes in negotiations, Sakai's real power surpasses everything</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Japan's diplomatic policy toward North China has always aimed at resolving the entire issue. Before reaching its final goal, it uses a flanking approach, advancing step by step. Minor issues are resolved one at a time, but new ones arise, leading to endless complications. It will not let go until its wishes are fulfilled. Since the establishment of the Tanggu Truce, many issues have been resolved. However, one wave subsides only for another to rise, just like the Northern saying, "endless, never done." Recently, several trivial issues have been resolved, some of which have been announced and some of which have not. However, the Japanese negotiators are still diligently traveling back and forth, pressing forward with increased intensity. This is because the ultimate goal has not been reached, so they continue to use flanking tactics to achieve their wishes. The real power in Japanese diplomacy toward North China lies not with the diplomatic personnel, but with the young military officers. The diplomatic personnel are merely nominal or can only talk but not act. This abnormal reality creates discord. Young military officers have strong desires and ambitions, and tend to advocate for rapid progress. They seem to lack patience with the twists and turns of diplomatic personnel, and accusations are inevitable. Diplomatic personnel have advocated the so-called "water bird diplomacy" as a shield, intending to show that the methods adopted may be different, but their spirit is no different from what the young military officers advocate. However, despite advocating this for a long time, it is still difficult to reduce the accusations. Therefore, some people have strongly advocated the "woodpecker diplomacy," the woodpecker pecking at wood, with both feet clinging to the tree, shaking its head and wagging its tail, being inwardly quiet and outwardly active, taking the meaning of having a master within while actively moving forward. It is advocated to adhere to a fixed diplomatic policy and actively advance. Recently, the Japanese side is still in the midst of disputes over this matter. It is difficult to predict what will happen. However, no matter what, Japan's diplomacy toward North China will become increasingly tighter, which has become an undeniable trend.</p>
<p>The most authoritative of the Japanese negotiators stationed in North China is Sakai, the Chief of Staff of the Tianjin North China Garrison Army. Shiba and Iga, who previously ran around and acted arbitrarily, were merely messengers. Shiba has been transferred back to his country for some reason and replaced by Takahashi, who is Sakai's confidant and will undoubtedly obey his orders. There have been recent rumors that Iga will also be transferred back to his country, but there is no news of his successor. Sakai visited Beijing once a month ago regarding a certain issue, stayed for a day or two, and then returned to Tianjin. The negotiations did not yield any results. In short, North China diplomacy is indeed tighter than before. (January 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Tight Business Conditions in Fuzhou <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>But the Minhou Tax Bureau Actually Increases Taxes</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Gregorian New Year has passed, and the Lunar New Year is approaching. The period for settling debts in the Fujian business community still uses the lunar calendar as the standard. This year, after the victory over bandits, it will definitely be more optimistic than last year's political change. According to those familiar with business conditions, the current business has not yet returned to its original state. The four major export commodities of the province, tea, paper, wood, and bamboo shoots, have all suffered losses due to falling prices and stagnation in foreign ports. The amount of money returned for the year-end settlements (i.e., the redemption of goods) is very small. Most of the money houses have not cleared the huge amounts of money owed by the pawnshops (it is estimated that the total amount owed by the pawnshops to the money houses last year was around one million yuan) and are all wary. Unlike last year, there was a flexible solution of rolling over the debt (transferring the loan debt to a promissory note). Therefore, the number of promissory notes issued for the New Year this year is extremely tight. Although many new banks have been established (it is estimated that four new banks have been established this year: Jiaotong, Shiye, Xingtai, and Nongmin), loans cannot be granted without collateral, which is different from the credit loans of money houses. Therefore, financial conditions are still tight this year and are still in a dangerous period. We must wait until the day of the final settlement to celebrate getting through the difficult situation. However, in order to reorganize tax revenues due to the shortfall in tax revenues last year, the Minhou Tax Bureau has specially increased the business tax of all industries by 20% starting this year, based on the original amount. The various trade associations believe that it is extremely difficult to increase the burden in the current business downturn and convened a meeting at the county chamber of commerce on the 11th, deciding to elect representatives to request the Finance Department of the Provincial Government to exempt them from the increase. It is unknown whether they will be approved. As for the city's grain, due to the poor harvests of both the early and late rice last year due to floods and droughts, unscrupulous merchants took advantage of the high rice prices in Shanghai and smuggled exports to seek huge profits, resulting in the price of high-quality rice reaching ten yuan per picul. Recently, because the selling price of rice produced in Luoluo Annam in Hong Kong is still low, most rice merchants have purchased and transported it to Fujian from Hong Kong to make adjustments. The cost of each picul is only about eight yuan. At the same time, a small amount of rice is also transported to the province from Shaowu and Guangze counties in northern Fujian. Therefore, it is hoped that rice prices will not continue to rise by the end of the lunar year. (January 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e101">This Year is Construction Year for Jiangxi Province <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Urgent Matters Being Implemented Step by Step</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: After the bandit scourge in Jiangxi Province, most of the territory is in ruins. Rural production has been completely destroyed. If we want to restore vitality and revitalize various aspects in the future, it cannot be achieved without active construction. Therefore, the provincial government has specifically designated this year as the "Construction Year," selecting simple and easy-to-implement tasks that are most urgently needed for rescuing the dying, healing the wounded, and recuperating, and implementing them step by step. The progress and plans for various aspects such as civil affairs, finance, construction, education, and disaster relief are briefly described below:</p>
<p>The goal of civil administration and political work is to follow the four words "Manage, Educate, Nurture, and Protect" as instructed by Chiang Kai-shek, integrating the four into one. The ongoing measures include: (1) Universally and strictly organizing and utilizing the Baojia system; (2) Vigorously implementing the "Qingxiang" (cleansing the countryside) in newly recovered areas, and completing the anti-communist volunteer corps in various bandit areas; (3) Reorganizing the county-level militia and police to strengthen self-defense; (4) Requiring labor in safe areas and implementing labor construction.</p>
<p>Conscription: Starting this year, conscription will be implemented. The first batch of recruits consists of 32 regiments of new soldiers, who all joined the army on New Year's Day. After that, there will be a batch every six months. The previously recruited regiments can all be transformed into compulsory military service. In a few years, all men aged 21 to 40 will be soldiers. Finance: The annual income and expenditure of the province's finances are both over 17 million yuan. Arbitrary levies have been eliminated by more than 4 million yuan. All counties and localities are also vigorously implementing budgets and final accounts. Starting this year, all expenses for local militias, Baojia, etc., will be centrally collected and disbursed to avoid arbitrary levies and waste.</p>
<p>Construction: (1) Highways: The total length of provincial and county roads in the province is over 9,000 li. This year, in addition to using all the business income of the Highway Bureau as expansion funds, it is also planned to complete the road fees in various places and southern Jiangxi to 3 million yuan. (2) Water Conservancy: To be completed in six years, with a planned annual labor conscription of 10 million and an estimated annual cost of materials of about 1 million yuan. The Fuchu River has already started conscripting labor for dredging. (3) Afforestation: Seedlings are cultivated in seven central areas. (4) The Agricultural Institute, which bears the responsibility of revitalizing Jiangxi, is making steady progress in improving agricultural technology and revitalizing the rural economy. (5) The Provincial Rural Cooperative Association and the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee have established more than 3,000 formal and preparatory cooperatives in the past two years. The Executive Yuan previously allocated 340,000 yuan in funds, and the committee later allocated another 500,000 yuan. If promoted effectively in the future, it can serve as the main force for rural revitalization. In addition, the revitalization of the porcelain industry, the centralized control of wolfram ore, the establishment of paper mills, and the Nanchang Hydropower Plant are also being planned and implemented.</p>
<p>Education: The Department of Education has decided on four major goals: (1) Universalize county education (i.e., realize Baojia-linked schools with Baojia as the hub); (2) Promote special education in newly recovered areas; (3) Expand and restore schools in various places that have been suspended due to banditry; (4) Vigorously implement rural education.</p>
<p>Hygiene: Since the establishment of the Provincial Health Department last year, the National Economic Commission has allocated 200,000 yuan to build a provincial hospital, which is scheduled to be completed this year. The establishment of clinics in bandit areas, county-level hospitals in various counties, the eradication of infectious diseases in various places, and the management of public health are still under development.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief: Although the 24th year of the Republic (1935) is the "Construction Year," bandit disasters, droughts, and floods have spread throughout the province, making disaster relief extremely important. The most important tasks in the future are: (1) Sending stranded refugees back to their hometowns; (2) Urgently assisting the various bandit areas that continue to be recovered; (3) Setting up refugee camps as the suppression progresses; (4) Coordinating drought relief; (5) Cooperating with rural associations to carry out agricultural relief and land reclamation in various places; (6) Organizing work relief; (7) Establishing winter relief associations to distribute porridge; (8) Distributing winter clothing, salt, and medicine.

<h3 id="e102">Establishment of the Cultural Relics Committee of the Former Capital <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>First Meeting Held at the Political Reorganization Committee, Appointing Weng Wenhao, Zhu Qiqian, and Others as Members</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: Since the issue of demarcating the boundaries of Hebei-Peiping Province and City was shelved, the so-called plan to expand Peiping City has turned into the reorganization of cultural relics of the former capital. Previously, when Yuan Liang arrived in Beijing to discuss the demarcation of provincial and municipal boundaries, he had various practical agreements with the central government regarding the methods of reorganizing cultural relics. The central government decided at that time that the first priority was the 3.09 million yuan of operating expenses, and the second was to entrust the Political Reorganization Committee with the overall power and assign the municipal government the responsibility of performing the work. Since Yuan Liang returned to Peiping, he has been preparing step by step in accordance with this method and decided to hold the inaugural meeting of the (Cultural Relics Reorganization Committee of the Former Capital) at 10:00 a.m. today (11th) at the Political Reorganization Committee. In addition to the representatives not sent by the Ministry of Education, the ex officio members include Mayor Yuan Liang, Hebei Chairman Yu Xuezhong, Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan, Internal Affairs Representative Luo Yaoshu, Finance Representative Ding Chungao, Railways Representative Yin Tong, Communications Representative Shen Jianshi, and Antiquities Preservation Committee and Palace Museum Representative Ma Heng. After the inaugural meeting, the first meeting was held in the conference hall on the fourth floor of the Political Reorganization Committee. In addition to the ex officio members, eight invited members with the nature of experts, scholars, and social celebrities were also appointed, including Zhu Qiqian, Weng Wenhao, Zhu Shen, Chen Hanti, Cheng Ke, Zhou Zuomin, Yuan Dunli, and Fang Juehui, etc. Zhou Zuomin, Yuan Dunli, and Fang Juehui had been appointed but were unable to attend. The secretaries were Xia Qingyi, secretary of the Political Reorganization Committee, and six others. Because the huge amount of 3.9 million yuan had been decided for operating expenses, there was no provision for administrative expenses. Therefore, all office matters were kept simple and frugal. Xia Qingyi and other staff members were borrowed from the Political Reorganization Committee and served concurrently without additional pay. At the meeting today, Chairman Huang Fu discussed and resolved three motions: one was the rules of procedure for the meeting, one was the procedures for implementing the reorganization of culture, and one was the establishment of a committee to manage funds, and Huang Fu, Zhou Zuomin, Ding Chungao, Yin Tong, Yuan Liang and other five people were nominated as the custodians. The meeting adjourned at 12:30. Huang hosted a banquet for all the attending members and important officials in the large reception room of the Political Reorganization Committee. After the meal, Xia Qingyi drafted a report to the central government and related parties on the establishment of the committee. From that day on, the official seal was put into use and office work began. (11th)</p>

<p>Connect Traffic on the Borders of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hubei, with the Entire Line Divided into Fifteen Sections for Construction</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that the Shishi-Baokang Highway in western Hubei is related to the traffic on the borders of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hubei. Currently, with the westward flight of Jiangxi bandits, Sichuan and Guizhou provinces have become the focus of military operations. It is urgent to complete the road to facilitate encirclement and suppression. He specially ordered the Hubei Construction Department to quickly plan and start construction. After receiving the order, the Construction Department immediately sent Chief Engineer Xu, leading a large number of engineering personnel, to take a boat west from Hankou. The entire line has been divided into fifteen sections for construction on a fixed date. The required funds will be drawn from the 6 million yuan of the 24th year construction public bonds. The starting and ending points and distances of each section are as follows: (1) Enlong Section: from Enshi Airport to Longfeng Dam, 27.5 kilometers long; (2) Longlu Section: from Longfeng Dam to Luzhou Dam, 36.5 kilometers long; (3) Lubai Section: from Luzhou Dam to Baiyangping, 25.0 kilometers long; (4) Baiwu Section: from Baiyangping to Wuyang Bridge, 23.5 kilometers long; (5) Wujian Section: from Wuyang Bridge to the South Gate Bridge of Jianshi, 14.5 kilometers long; (6) Jianxia Section: from the South Gate Bridge of Jianshi to Xiaba Guan, 22.0 kilometers long; (7) Xiayang Section: from Xiaba Guan to Yangpo, 8.0 kilometers long; (8) Yangda Section: from Yangpo to Damaotian, 23.0 kilometers long; (9) Dachao Section: from Damaotian to Chaoyangping, 46.0 kilometers long; (10) Chaolong Section: from Chaoyangping to Longtanping, 47.0 kilometers long; (11) Longzhong Section: from Longtanping to Zhong Sanyuanshi, 47.0 kilometers long; (12) Zhonglu Section: from Zhong Sanyuanshi to Lǜcongpo, 17.5 kilometers long; (13) Lucha Section: from Lǜcongpo to Chadianzi, 37.5 kilometers long; (14) Chashui Section: from Chadianzi to Shuitianba, 27.0 kilometers long; (15) Shuiwan Section: from Shuitianba to Wanhu Tuo, 32.0 kilometers long, totaling 454.0 kilometers.

<p>Yesterday evening at about 7:00 PM, more than a dozen robbers with guns and weapons suddenly entered the Zhu Hengfeng Rice Shop outside the South Gate of this city. They first threatened to silence everyone, and then opened the accounting room and looted all the silver dollars and cash.

After inspection, it was estimated that more than 2,000 yuan was robbed.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Suzhou Sets Deadline to Complete Sukun Road <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The road built by military engineers between Suzhou and Kunshan, although rugged and hastily constructed, is still an existing thoroughfare. The Provincial Construction Department believes that there is a need for a direct thoroughfare between Suzhou and Shanghai. In addition to the section east of Kunshan, which is being discussed by this department and the Shanghai Municipal Government, it has been decided that the Sukun section will be widened to seven meters based on the original military road. All bridges, estimated to be more than 40, must be rebuilt, and the road surface must also be refilled. The estimated cost of labor and materials is only 300,000 yuan. In order to complete it as soon as possible, the department has dispatched Liu Yeqiu and others to Suzhou to prepare for the project, and also dispatched engineer Xu Zhongming and others to Kunshan on the 15th to inspect the route. As soon as the survey is completed and the design is finished, construction must begin. It is also heard that the deadline is four full months, and the work must be completed and open to traffic by the end of May.</p>
<h3 id="e106">All Suzhou Vegetable Vendors Petition to Abolish Vegetable Tax <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>There are seventeen vegetable markets in Suzhou City. Currently, Wei Du is contracted by the county government to collect vegetable tax, paying 300 yuan per month. Wei then dispatches a large number of tax collectors to collect tax from various vegetable vendors, and even street vendors must pay tax, causing all kinds of harassment. The general petty vendors are full of complaints. The other day, Ji Xiaosong, supervisor of the County Chamber of Commerce, visited County Magistrate Wu to ask him to cancel Wei's contract in order to lighten the burden on petty vendors. Yesterday (15th), the vegetable vendors put forward representatives Yuan Jinsheng and 85 others to submit a petition to the county government, claiming that vegetable vendors have small businesses and cannot afford the monthly tax. They requested that the county government consider the hard-earned money of the poor people and exempt them from paying the摊捐 [tan juan, apportioned levies], in order to make a living.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Wujiang Vegetable Boat Detained in Minhang <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Due to the severe drought this year, the farmers in the Hubin area are extremely distressed. In winter, they mostly rely on transporting vegetables and other goods to Shanghai for sale in order to make a living. These vegetables were transported by the Zhenze Taihu Vegetable Transportation Company in previous years. This year, there are more shipments, and Zhou Maosheng of Damiaogang has initiated a new shipping company, which charges low fees and is developing very well. Unexpectedly, a shift on December 18th was suddenly detained in Minhang. Because the vegetables were left unattended, they are in danger of rotting, and the farmers dare not load them again. It is now heard that the new company has entrusted someone to intercede.</p>

<p>In recent months, the county has been experiencing continuous rain and warm weather, like a second spring, so plants are also exhibiting abnormal conditions. Vegetables and broad beans are blooming and bearing fruit one after another. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday (14th), a sudden north wind howled, and the climate suddenly turned cold. The thermometer dropped from over 50 degrees to below 35 degrees, suddenly becoming a severe winter scene. However, there was still drizzle. It was not until yesterday (15th) that it cleared up, and it was still severely cold.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Department of Finance believes that the provincial treasury is extremely short of funds, and the outstanding land taxes of various counties are very large. Therefore, it specially dispatched Commissioner Huang Shi to Wuxi to clear up and strictly pursue the taxes, as urgent as a starfire. Recently, Commissioner Huang and the county government of this county have jointly formulated measures to clear up the old taxes. It is stipulated that each collection office should check the records every day according to the registration of each map section. All those who owe more than one yuan should be extracted household by household, and then extracted in order down to one dime. The list of extractions extracted each day must be made in duplicate, one copy to be handed over to the tax collector for collection, and one copy to be posted on the notice board and issued to the picture chiefs for actual posting of the notice. If the tax is not paid within one month, the property will be confiscated for offset, and the district chiefs and village heads will effectively assist in publicizing.</p>

<p>Director Chen Zhongda of the Local Property Office, in order to deal with the arrears of expenses for various agencies and the inability of various creditors to cope with the imminent abolition of the lunar calendar at the end of the year, and because Public Security Bureau Chief Liu Hanzhen was ordered to be transferred to the province a few days ago, and the various chiefs and policemen of the Public Security Bureau were questioning the arrears of expenses for May and June during his tenure, Chen specially submitted a report to the county government on the 12th, requesting the Finance Department to check and indicate that the county taxes from the 17th to the 20th year of the Republic (1928-1931) would be used as collateral, and to temporarily borrow more than 15,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank to overcome the difficulties.</p>

<p>At the beginning of December last year, the Miscellaneous Tax Office of this county suddenly included the clothing industry in the category of shops and increased the collection of house tax. The workers in the industry, because of the high cost of rice and firewood in recent times, could not afford the burden, and repeatedly held meetings in the past month to petition the county government to demand the withdrawal of the tax increase order. It is now learned that County Magistrate Zhai, after consideration, in order to reduce the burden on workers, decided to exempt them from the tax.

<p>The Huaiyin Puhui Congee Factory distributes thin congee every year as usual to help the starving refugees from near and far. The manager of the factory, Ni Jiafu, has once again raised 10,000 yuan from various places this year, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government has subsidized 6,000 yuan, totaling more than 1,000 dan of rice purchased in the Gaoyou Shiying area. On the morning of the 9th, the rice was officially steamed and distributed. It is estimated that there were no fewer than 5,000 refugees who ate on this day, including local and foreign refugees. The amount of rice required was 20 dan, for a total of 24 pots. Compared with the past when the most congee was cooked, it was still less than four or five pots. However, this is only the beginning of the distribution, and all the refugees who eat from far away have not yet arrived. However, according to the average distribution of the prepared rice, it is only enough for more than a month. Therefore, Ni will continue to go to Beijing and Shanghai to raise funds in order to extend the period.</p>

Therefore, he raised 10,000 yuan and submitted a report to the Anti-Smoking Association, requesting permission to open an Opium Paste Company in the city. The association forwarded the report to the provincial government for review, and the provincial government has now approved the request.</p>

His family has repeatedly requested bail, and the authorities have agreed to release him on bail after finding a suitable guarantor. However, for the sake of prudence, there must be conditions attached in order to summon him for questioning at any time.

<p>Because the collection of grain tax in Xiaoshan County this year is very light, the superiors have been urging payment urgently. The county government has been sending personnel to the countryside to urge collection for days, but the local area is poor and the number of collections has not improved. In addition, the farmers are only willing to pay 30% of the rent, and even do not return a single grain. Landlords are unable to collect rent and do not pay grain tax, which has a significant impact on national tax revenue.</p>

Unexpectedly, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Ford plane landed at Longhua Airport at 1:25 p.m. There were only a few soldiers and police guarding the airport, and none of the welcoming personnel met him. After Chiang and his wife got off the plane, they transferred to a car and returned to their private residence on Jiaer Yelu Road to rest. In addition to Madam Chiang, Chiang Kai-shek's secretary Wang Rizhang, bodyguard He Yun, and two adjutants also came with him.</p>

Then, they turned from Baoshan Road into Jiangwan Road, and passed through Xiangyin Road to visit the city center. When Chairman Chiang and his wife passed the Municipal Government, they did not get out of the car due to the haste of time, and turned from Wuquan Road into Jungong Road.

<p>Both the Silver and Money Trades Can Safely Weather the Year-End</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, in order to prevent a tight money situation in Shanghai at the time of the final year-end settlement, entrusted the Central Bank to purchase 20 million yuan of silver from Hong Kong for shipment to Shanghai. The first batch has already arrived, and the second batch will arrive soon. However, due to the situation in the Hong Kong market, it is feared that the 20 million yuan cannot be shipped as scheduled before the final settlement. But they have tried their best to arrange for shipment to Shanghai, the more the better.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Financial Stability <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's finances were previously tight due to the autumn harvest in the mainland countryside and the export of silver. The Shanghai money market's overnight loan interest rate reached a peak of sixty cents per thousand. Since the silver and money trades have made every effort to adjust, and the Central, China, and Communications Banks have designated loans and discounts, and after the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee purchased silver and shipped it to Shanghai, it has become stable. The Shanghai money market's overnight loan interest rate has fallen to twenty cents per thousand yesterday, returning to normal, and is even lower than before the annual settlement. As for the loans and discounts made by the three banks, most have already been repaid.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Safely Weathering the Year-End <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Silver and Money Trades Association yesterday that in this time of rural decline and business depression, the silver and money trades are taking all lending matters very seriously. Banks only make loans with collateral, and money shops also focus on collateral loans. They are very cautious about credit loans. Therefore, it is predicted that the member banks and money shops of the two trade associations will be able to safely weather the final settlement period of the 23rd year.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Ministry of Finance Stipulates Procedures for Obtaining Permits to Transport Silver <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Ministry of Railways to Instruct Railway Bureaus to Comply</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Two Roads Administration received Instruction No. 21 from the Ministry of Railways, which stated: "With the approval of Document No. 11196, Qian Zi, dated December 26 of last year from the Ministry of Finance, it has been in practice for many years to require that a permit be obtained from this Ministry for the transport of silver. Recently, in order to prevent the transfer and smuggling of silver, we have ordered all customs offices to release silver only upon presentation of a permit and not to allow private transport without a permit. However, it is found that silver standard currency should still be freely circulated within the country. Now, at the time of the entry of local products into the market, transportation should be facilitated. The procedures for obtaining a permit are now stipulated as follows:"</p>
<h3 id="e137">Five Procedures <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>(1) When silver and money businesses and ordinary businesses in the capital and Shanghai areas apply for a permit to transport silver, they should still apply to this Ministry. However, banks must attach a guarantee from the Bankers Association, and money shops must attach a guarantee from the Money Traders Association. Businesses must attach a guarantee from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Foreign banks should apply through the Central Bank. (2) In areas outside the capital and Shanghai, customs supervisors are allowed to pre-receive blank silver transport permits from the Ministry and issue them locally. The destination and amount of silver transported should be listed and reported to the Ministry for verification on a monthly basis. The original permits should be returned to the Ministry for verification and cancellation after use. All permit fees and stamp duties should be handled in accordance with regulations. (3) When silver and money businesses and ordinary businesses apply for a permit to transport silver from the nearest customs supervisor, they must have a guarantee from the local Chamber of Commerce or Silver and Money Trades Association. The customs supervisor should verify the information and issue the permit. If there is any collusion to smuggle goods under the guise of this permit, once verified, the supervisor will be removed and punished, and the permit-issuing businesses and guarantors will be dealt with in accordance with the smuggling penalty measures. (4) In areas without customs offices, if the amount of silver coins transported is more than one thousand yuan, a certificate should be issued by the local Chamber of Commerce or Silver and Money Trades Association for presentation to checkpoints and military police along the way for inspection. (5) All guarantees should ensure that the transport is for legitimate domestic commercial purposes and that there is no transfer or smuggling. Violators will be held jointly responsible. The certificate should certify the amount, destination, and actual purpose of the transport and that there is no transfer or smuggling. Violators will be held jointly responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Trial Implementation Today <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The above five items have been modified to some extent based on current practices, so that laws, regulations, business conditions, and overall considerations are taken into account. They will be implemented on a trial basis starting today. If the amount of silver transported is more than one thousand yuan and the transporter does not have a permit from this Ministry or a certificate from the local Chamber of Commerce or Silver and Money Trades Association, the silver should be detained and referred to this Ministry for processing. In addition to separate consultations, the Ministry requests your department to investigate and instruct all road bureaus to comply, and to further instruct all stations to comply. This order has been forwarded by the Road Bureau to the Transportation Department for compliance.</p>
<p>Note: The execution of the fourth item has been temporarily suspended, as seen in the Ministry of Finance's order of the tenth day.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Xu Shiying Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, Talking About Receiving 300,000 in Relief Funds <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Another 250,000 Will Also Be Allocated Soon, and the Rural Loan Group Has Already Begun Organizing</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, went to Beijing on official business a few days ago. He completed his work the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai by river steamer, arriving at the port at about 2 p.m. yesterday. He returned to his residence to rest, and at about 4 p.m., he went to the Famine Relief Association for Various Provinces to review official documents. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Xu at the Association, who spoke about the situation of his trip to Beijing to negotiate various important matters as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e140">300,000 in Relief Funds Remitted to Shanghai <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu first stated, "The greatest task of my trip to Beijing was that the weather is now becoming increasingly cold, and the general disaster victims are suffering from both cold and hunger. The matter of providing relief is urgent and cannot be delayed. Therefore, when I went to Beijing, I had a thorough discussion with the authorities, and they immediately allocated 300,000 in cash, which was remitted to Shanghai. Our association has now received the funds and will immediately send personnel to various disaster areas to provide relief. Another 250,000 will also be allocated as soon as our association prepares the official procedures and submits them to the government. The timeframe should be no more than ten days. As for the association's plan to hire a Western consultant, because there is no need in fact, and it would only increase expenses, it has been temporarily postponed."</p>
<h3 id="e141">Revitalizing the Countryside by Forming a Loan Group <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu further told the Central News Agency reporter, "I (Mr. Xu referring to himself) went to Beijing this time because I felt that the bankruptcy of the countryside was becoming more and more acute, and it was necessary to provide relief as soon as possible. Therefore, I suggested to the government that a rural loan group be established. It is known to all that 85% of our country's population are farmers, and China is founded on agriculture. If we sit idly by and watch the bankruptcy of the countryside, how can the economy of the entire country and society be maintained? Although the financial authorities have stipulated that the banking sector should do its best to invest in the countryside, Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and most banks still neglect to invest in the countryside. Now, although the banking sector can pay attention to this, the results of my consultations with the authorities in Beijing this time are to jointly organize a rural loan group with the major banks in Shanghai. The capital is tentatively set at 10 million yuan, with the Central Bank responsible for 30% of the total, and the remaining 70% to be invested in the countryside by the major banks according to the size of their capital. After the capital is collected, a rural loan group will be organized. The group's operations will be planned by those with specialized knowledge of rural finance, and those with rich experience and knowledge of rural finance will be invited to serve as the head of the group. I will convene the heads of the major banks in Shanghai in the shortest possible time to discuss and implement active measures. I firmly believe that the rural economy can be revitalized in this way, which is the fundamental way to restore the national and social economy. Otherwise, if the 85% of farmers are in a state of deep distress and are not given effective relief, the remaining 15% of the people will also find it difficult to stabilize their lives."</p>

<p>Mr. Xu concluded, "Regarding the Huangshan construction project, I convened the committee members in Beijing this time to earnestly discuss the implementation plan. It was decided to carry it out in three years. This year is designated as the transportation construction year, next year as the production construction year, and the year after as the cultural construction year. Five years later, the Huangshan Administration Bureau will be established, and all local affairs will be the responsibility of the Bureau to promote, as a model for national autonomy. The committee is now proceeding diligently according to the established principles to see it through to completion."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mengtena Chu Rushed 8,000 Miles to Fulfill Her Civic Duty</p>
<p>In matters concerning the public, it is important for those involved to unite and bravely fulfill their responsibilities in order to succeed. Conversely, if there are difficulties and everyone shirks responsibility, there is no way to avoid failure. In this Saar plebiscite to determine the region's allegiance, judging from the general trend, the majority of the 540,000 votes will favor returning the land to Germany. Therefore, the German victory is certain. However, the Germans still do not rely on their certainty of victory and slack off. Those who were born in the Saar but live overseas do not mind the hardship of travel, trek long distances, and return to their homeland to fulfill their responsibilities. There are indeed many. Some returned from South America, some traveled far from Japan, and one German woman from Shanghai also rushed and traveled quickly for this matter, finally reaching her destination on the day of the vote and being the last person to vote. This spirit of unity and bravery in fulfilling one's responsibilities is worthy of our admiration and emulation. It is specially recorded as follows: After Germany's defeat in the European War, it suffered the humiliation of being forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which was heavily binding. Even today, Britain is proposing to abolish the military provisions of the treaty and treat Germany as an equal (see today's Reuters report). This is not without this spirit leading to it.</p>
<p>Three months ago, Mrs. Mengtena Chu, a German woman, heard that the Saar plebiscite was scheduled.</p>

<p>The time for collecting bills is extended, and interest is set to stop for four days starting on the 4th to sort everything out.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association decided to set February 3rd as the final settlement date for the 23rd year. Yesterday, it notified all member money shops to comply. The notification is recorded below: "To whom it may concern, with regard to the proposal of the 15th meeting of the 2nd membership representative conference, the handling of business before and after the final settlement of the 23rd year was discussed and resolved. February 3rd of the 24th year was set as the final settlement date for the 23rd year. From February 4th to the 7th, there will be a four-day holiday after the final settlement to sort everything out. This four-day period will be the dismissal period. The remaining three items, such as the interest issue before the final settlement, the bill collection period, and the overnight loan interest rate, will be fully decided by the standing committee entrusted by the representative conference. They are recorded in the minutes. At the 67th meeting of the 2nd standing committee on the 12th of this month, the following was resolved: (1) Regarding the interest issue before the final settlement, it was decided that from January 1st to the 15th, the deposit interest rate will be 11.95 yuan, and the overdue interest will be added as usual. The deposit interest rate from the 16th will be decided by the executive committee on the 25th and announced later. (2) Regarding the bill collection period, it was decided that it will be until 4 p.m. on January 29th. The return of bills will be extended by one hour as usual, and they will be settled as soon as they arrive on February 3rd.

This notification is hereby issued, and it is hoped that you will check and comply."</p>
<p>As the vote drew near, she went to the German Consulate General in Shanghai to apply for permission to return to the Saar to vote. After a long time, she did not receive a reply, and at first thought that she had lost her opportunity to fulfill her responsibilities. But on Christmas Day, she suddenly received a phone call from the consulate, saying that according to a telegram from the government, the matter could be carried out as requested, and asked if she could go to the consulate the next day to discuss it. Mrs. Chu was overjoyed to hear the news, and without waiting, she went to the consulate the next day and learned that the consulate not only approved her return home to vote, but also offered to buy her a boat ticket. This was on Wednesday, December 26th. The next day, Thursday, Mrs. Chu was busy all day, without taking a break, because her passport still needed to be signed by the Soviet and Polish consulates. On Friday, Mrs. Chu packed her luggage, and her husband withdrew travel and living expenses. At 9 a.m. on Saturday morning, she boarded a Japanese ship to Dalian, and then rushed to Harbin from that port. However, the Siberian rain and snow blocked the way for the train, and Mrs. Chu was extremely anxious, fearing that she would arrive in Saarbrücken after the voting period. When German Aviation Minister Göring heard that Mrs. Chu had returned from afar to fulfill her responsibilities, he worried that she would be late and disappointed, so he specially prepared a plane for Mrs. Chu to ride in. On one hand, he asked the Saar Committee to specially allow the plane to fly over the border. According to a Saarbrücken telegram from the National Society on the 13th (today, the last person to vote here was Mrs. Mengtena Chu. Because she rushed to vote, she traveled from Shanghai, taking a ship, train, and plane along the way, covering a total of 8,000 miles, so she was very tired when she arrived here. When she took a car to the polling station to vote, her face was filled with joy, as if to show that she had fulfilled her responsibilities). According to the report, Mrs. Chu first arrived in Shanghai from Germany and worked as a watch tester at the China Clock Company. In 1926, she married Mengtena Chu. Mr. Meng has a shop at No. 1163 Jing'an Temple Road. Mrs. Chu has a mother who is 77 years old and seven brothers and sisters, all living in Saarbrücken. According to her husband yesterday, Mrs. Chu will stay for a few months to enjoy the joy of family.</p>

<p>National News Agency, 本埠消息, The British Universities Association held a luncheon at the Kyoto Hotel yesterday afternoon, chaired by President Kim, and invited Howard, chief writer of the North China Daily News, to speak on India's new constitution. President Kim first thanked the Chinese members on behalf of the British members of the association for their hospitality at the International Sports Association last month. Then, he introduced Mr. Howard, saying that he had lived in India for many years, first as a journalist, then as a British official, and participated in the Simon Commission. Howard stood up and said that India's new constitution was neither a prelude to independence from Britain nor a conspiracy to squeeze out Gandhi. In fact, it was only the inevitable result of Britain's policy towards India since 1833. According to the British Parliament's Act of 1833, the East India Company was abolished, and the relationship between the Indian people and their government was also established. When the British House of Commons discussed the Indian Act, Lord Macaulay paid special attention to the future of the Indian Empire, because at that time he had foreseen that as a result of Europeanization, the Indians would inevitably demand a Western political system. A hundred years ago, this Scotsman foresaw today's new constitution for India by the British government, which is truly amazing. The secret behind the growth of Indian nationalism can be found in Panipat. Panipat is a small village between Delhi and Ambala. Three times, the fate of India was decided in this small village. Each battle was won by the invaders. The last battle took place in 1761, four years after the Battle of Plassey. Those who read British history know it well. As a result of this battle, the British power to rule India was established, and India no longer feared invasion, and the Indians became accustomed to living in peace, and nationalism grew and developed under British guidance. Nationalism is also the precursor to parliamentary government. The policy of allowing Indians to participate in politics only dealt with Indian representation until the Morley-Minto Reforms. Since the declaration of 1917 and the establishment of the current temporary constitution, the responsibility system has been partially introduced into the political system, and this responsibility system has a distinction of division. The so-called division is to retain certain powers of the government, and transfer the remaining powers to the Indian officials who are responsible to the provincial council. This system was set to be reviewed after ten years. Therefore, the Simon Investigation Committee was established. The chairman of the committee is the current Foreign Secretary Simon, and Edward Cadogan, the brother of the Minister to China Cadogan, is also a member. Edward Cadogan is the person who signed the Simon Report. The Simon Report advocated provincial autonomy in India, but with the establishment of an All-India Federation as the ultimate goal. The members of the committee believed that the past constitutional acts were specifically established for British India, and there would be no long-term solution if the various states of India were not considered together. Therefore, they advocated that such a plan could be implemented on a trial basis when the Indian princes volunteered to participate in the federation. Something unexpected happened. When the round table conference was first held, the Indian princes expressed their willingness to participate in the federation. This completely changed the situation, and the Indian constitutional reform plan had to stipulate the All-India Federal Political System in addition to stipulating provincial autonomy. There is only one prerequisite, that is, more than half of the Indian princes must participate. The Indian Federation has become a unique entity, with one part of its composition being the provinces of British India under civil rule and the other part being the Indian states ruled by princes. The risk of implementing such a constitution is great, but the risk of not doing it is also great. If the risk is not taken, the achievements that Britain has made in India in the past cannot be obtained. Any constitution has safeguards. The word safeguard causes misunderstanding, but its intention is to allow responsible government to be implemented. Without this safeguard, the entire plan may fail. India cannot have an organized and sound political party in Britain, and strong public opinion sufficient to cope with administrative problems. India cannot allow its two major groups of different religions and cultures to participate in politics side by side. Therefore, constituency elections are indispensable. Some people think this is an obstacle to responsible government, but the Simon Committee does not think so. It is already very difficult to transfer the responsibility for law and order in each province to the Indian officials. If it is not so, the so-called provincial autonomy is equal to empty talk. Moreover, the Indians have shown that they can take responsibility for law and order. Therefore, the Simon Committee's suggestion has been adopted by all parties. The so-called safeguards are that diplomacy and defense are still retained by the Governor-General of India and are not within the jurisdiction of the Federal Parliament. Regarding India's defense issues, this is indeed indispensable. There is also an important provision in the constitution, that is, the Indian railways are generally under the jurisdiction of a special railway authority to avoid interference from political forces, because the Indian railways are all state-owned, and they are very important to the national interests. The existing railways are a total of 79,000 miles long.</p>

<p>Hapag Sails on April 16, Norddeutscher Lloyd Sails on June 25</p>
<p>Messrs. Melchers &amp; Co., managers of Norddeutscher Lloyd and Hapag lines, are building high-speed new vessels to compete in the Europe-Asia trade, adding special express services to Central Europe. Norddeutscher Lloyd and Hapag are each adding two vessels. This matter was previously noted in this newspaper. Now, the first new vessel of Hapag is expected to arrive in China within five weeks on its maiden voyage. The first new vessel of Norddeutscher Lloyd is also expected to depart from Germany on May 8. It is expected that the Central Europe route will cause a great surge in express services. This matter is closely related to the Central Europe trade, and it is urgent to investigate and record it as follows.</p>

<p>Hapag and Norddeutscher Lloyd stand on the same front in the Far East trade, so this year they have increased the number of Central Europe express vessels, with each side opening two vessels. The first vessel of Hapag is the newly built mail steamer Cordillera. The Cordillera is 525 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 41 feet high, with a displacement of 16,000 tons. It uses an eight-cylinder diesel engine with 11,000 horsepower and travels at 17 nautical miles per hour. The first-class cabin has 149 rooms, the second-class cabin has 100 rooms, and the third-class cabin has 110 seats. All cabins are outside the deck corridor and are not subject to the heat of the engine room. All first, second, and third-class cabins have tea dance halls, grand halls, smoking rooms, library rooms, gyms, soda fountains, merchandise stores, barbershops, swimming pools, and so on. The glass hall can be opened and closed, and it can be called the world's most modern ship. The first voyage is scheduled to depart from Germany on February 20 and arrive in Shanghai on April 2.</p>

<p>Norddeutscher Lloyd's new Far East express vessel, the first vessel Scharnhorst, was launched on the 13th of last month and is now being processed to rush to install cabins. The vessel has a displacement of 17,000 tons and is 615 feet long. The cabins are divided into first and second class. The interior layout is based on the style of the Atlantic first-class giant mail steamers. Its luxury and grandeur are beyond the current Central European vessels. The swimming pool is located on the upper deck and is accessible to sunlight. Colored silk umbrellas are hung on the deck, and there are wine bars, soda fountains, and sports fields, so that passengers can rest after swimming, just like on the beach. Its various advantages are too numerous to mention. The speed is even stronger, and it can travel at 19 nautical miles per hour. It is limited to being completed by the end of April. The second vessel, Gneisenau, is the same size as its sister ship and is expected to arrive in Shanghai five months later.</p>

<p>The Hexpol Cardillera has been scheduled to depart next month, stopping at twelve ports en route to Shanghai, and also calling at Yokohama and Kobe in Japan. Therefore, its first maiden voyage to Shanghai has been set for April 16th, heading to Naples, Italy. As for the North German Lloyd's Xianghuosituo, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Germany on May 8th, stopping at fifteen ports along the way. Its first voyage will traverse various Mediterranean countries, so it is estimated to arrive in Shanghai around June 13th, also calling at Japan. The maiden voyage from Shanghai to Europe has been set for June 25th. The Hexpol's second ship, the Ribosidun, is larger than the Cardillera and has stronger horsepower. It only offers first and second class cabins, with greater luxury than the first ship. The departure date has not yet been determined. The North German Lloyd's second ship, the Rina Aesino, Gneisenan, has 152 first-class cabins and 142 second-class cabins and is expected to arrive in China at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Hexpol and North German Lloyd's express steamer routes not only shorten the voyage from Shanghai to Europe, but also connect to the Atlantic, linking with major European and American ships. The Hexpol Cardillera's route is from Shanghai to Naples, Italy, then to Marseille, via Barcelona, Spain, and then to Southampton, a major Atlantic postal hub. The North German Lloyd's Xianghuosituo and other two ships also go to Naples from Shanghai, via Hong Kong, Little Luzon, Singapore, Piraeus, Belawan Colombo, and Posey. It only takes 23 days to reach Italy, one day faster than the current Italian mail ships. Then it goes to Marseille via Spain, and then to Southampton. Shanghai mail ships directly reach Southampton, connecting to Atlantic mail ships, which is an innovation.</p>

<p>Jiangxi exhibition goods will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, has been open for two weeks since its opening. Although the weather has been unstable for days, there has been a considerable number of visitors and shoppers. It was originally scheduled to close today, but due to requests from most manufacturers to extend the exhibition, the association's committee has decided to extend the exhibition period by one week, closing on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month. The association's two-week statistics are excerpted as follows: (Business) Total of more than 69,730 yuan, (Visitors) Total of more than 97,430 people, with the most being people from Pudong and citizens, followed by representatives of groups, and the least being students from the Students' National Products Year.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi National Products Exhibition, previously organized by the association, had many twists and turns and almost became a stalemate. Later, the association made every effort to negotiate and finally held it. It has been closed for many days. Zhou Zhaolin, secretary of the association, and others returned to Shanghai from Jiangxi and reported on the process. According to them, the reason why people in Jiangxi suddenly expressed opposition to the National Products Exhibition was actually due to misunderstandings. Therefore, after I tried my best to explain to all parties in Jiangxi, the two sides did not break down in any way, that is, they understood each other. During the exhibition, there were crowds of people every day, and the results were also quite remarkable. After the closing, due to the handling of the return of exhibits and the completion of procedures with the tax bureau and customs, it was temporarily unable to be completed. All returned exhibits were originally planned to be loaded on the Sanbei Changxing wheel, but because the Changxing wheel did not dock at the Jiujiang wheel port, it was changed to the China Merchants Bureau Jing'an wheel, which sailed down from Jiujiang yesterday, and should arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Bicycle Manufacturers Association Requests the Finance Bureau to Improve License Fees <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bicycle Manufacturers Association submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, saying: This is a request. It says in the Municipal Public Works Bureau's Notice No. 226 that each bicycle should pay a license fee of 5 jiao, which is 3 yuan for the whole year, etc. Compared with the donation rate in previous years, it has increased by one yuan. After reading it, the members of the association all believed that in March last year, after the concession's Public Works Bureau announced an increase in bicycle license fees, they had explained the reasons and requested a quarterly reduction to show fairness. The concession's Public Works Bureau approved it, and from January 1, 1935, those who obtained a license would pay a full-year donation of 4 yuan, and those who obtained a license from July 1 would pay a donation of 2 yuan, which was reduced in installments. Now that the bicycle license donation in this city has also increased by one yuan, I don't know if the collection method is reduced in installments. Please present the previous situation, etc. According to this, the donation rate, whether large or small, should be based on the principle of equality. The license donation for any vehicle, whether collected quarterly or monthly, and there are regulations for returning the license and sending the donation for motor vehicle licenses, but it is unfair to collect the full year for bicycle license donations. Not only do passengers suffer the sacrifice of retroactivity, but the same industry association has more impact on sales in autumn and winter. Now that the bureau's increase in bicycle license donations is the same as that of the concession's Public Works Bureau, the collection method should not be different. Therefore, I would like to explain the previous situation and submit it to the bureau for review. I hope that the installments will be reduced in installments and quickly followed, which is convenient for the public. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e168">McNaughton Recounts His Encounter with Robbers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Robbers Were Skilled at Checking, Seemingly with Another Purpose, and Received Courteous Treatment from Chairman Huang and Others After Arriving in Hangzhou</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Bao, McNaughton, the Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Bureau, returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday (the 14th). He said that he was indeed robbed on the way to Hangzhou last Friday morning, but the incident was accidental and not unusual. Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong had entrusted the British Consul-General in Shanghai to arrange a meeting in Hangzhou, so he set off by car on Friday morning with a Chinese colleague. The journey was smooth, and at about 20 minutes past noon yesterday, he drove between Haining and Haiyan. He was tired and leaned against the corner of the car for a nap. Suddenly, he was awakened by a gunshot. At that time, the driver had slowed down the car, and then he saw a Chinese man with a pistol approaching the side of the car, so the car stopped. Then he saw another Chinese man with a pistol approaching from ten yards away. The first man ordered the driver to get out of the car and search his body and the front of the car. Then he touched McNaughton's outer clothing with his hand. According to McNaughton, the man seemed to be skilled at checking, and his purpose seemed to be something else, not just loose change. The searcher then asked the Chinese in the car for money. McNaughton carried two rolls of banknotes, one only about 40 yuan, and the other 100 yuan, so he took out the smaller one and handed it over. The man seemed satisfied and robbed the driver of 13 yuan and the Chinese in the car of 30 yuan. Although there were villagers watching from a distance, they did not come to help or catch the robbers. After the two robbers had finished robbing, they ordered the car to turn back and drove back about half a mile to a certain place, where they made a phone call to inform the stationmaster of Haining to warn other passengers arriving at the station. At that time, the Deputy Commissioner of Commerce of the Canadian Government and a friend happened to arrive at the station by car, and they were strongly urged not to move forward. McNaughton waited for about 20 minutes and decided to take the risk and continue to move forward. He finally arrived in Hangzhou at 2:30 pm, only one hour late. At that time, all police stations had received news of the robbery and were arresting the car. McNaughton then met with the chairman, mayor, etc., and received courteous treatment, and they were very concerned about McNaughton's experience on the way. When McNaughton left Hangzhou, the county magistrate personally sent him to the county boundary, with very thorough protection. It is suspected that the robbers must have received advance notice that opium or other valuables were passing through the area and mistakenly intercepted McNaughton's car, not intending to rob money.</p>
<h3 id="e169">International Trade Bureau Introduces New York's Need for Pig Bristles <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Exporters Can Contact the Bureau</p>
<p>Pig bristles are the hair that grows on the back of pigs, as hard as needles, about two to seven inches long. The quality depends on the origin and slaughter period, the length and color of the bristles. Generally, those produced in cold regions are better than those produced in temperate regions, and those obtained during the spring slaughter period are better than those obtained during the autumn slaughter period. Long and white ones are more expensive than short and black ones. Wild boar bristles are even more valuable than domestic pig bristles. Most of them are used to make brushes, and white bristles can also be used as raw materials for toothbrushes, hat brushes, etc. Every year, a large number of them are transported from Mongolia, Northeast China, North China, and provinces in the Yangtze River Basin to the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Tianjin, Chongqing, and Hankou are the export centers. The products produced in Sichuan are of excellent quality and are most welcome in the European market. Now, the West Duenus Import and Export Company in New York, USA, has sent a letter requesting pig bristles and rice ears for brush making. I hope that exporters will send a letter to the bureau's guidance office for introduction.</p>

Sixteen men and women, including the main criminal, Ge Xinglong (also known as Wu Xinlong, Ge Xingbang, and Ge Honggen) from Ningbo, were arrested. A large number of finished and unfinished red pills, as well as machinery and other items, were confiscated, along with Ge's own Peerka car, number 4482, and taken to the police station for separate detention. The two centers are now guarded by detectives. At 9:30 am yesterday, the police station escorted the criminals and the red pills to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special Court. Judge Wu Tingqi ascended the seat for interrogation and ordered the defendants to be detained separately until another hearing was scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Trial Situation <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The details are recorded below. First, the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that the police station is prosecuting the defendants in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Since the police station learned that the defendants had organized a large-scale red pill center, they immediately reported to the court and signed three search warrants numbered 1882, 1893, and 1894. At 12:15 pm yesterday, they first went to No. 10, Quanfu Lane, 301 Chengdu Road, to search and arrested the defendants Ge Xinglong, Wang Suozhen, Ma Zhuying, and Zhang Afu. Two boxes of morphine raw materials, one can of opium ash, and one bag of saccharin were confiscated. There was also a large cabinet containing seven bundles of cloth. Upon inspection, each cloth secretly contained seven large bags of red pills, each bag containing 10,000 pills, and the brand name was Xianma brand. There was a total of</p>
<h3 id="e172">700,000 Pills <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>According to Ge's statement at the time, these red pills were deposited by Xu Fengshan, who is on the run, and transported by his own car number 4482, driven by the driver Zhang Afu. Therefore, the car was also seized by the police station at the alleyway and is now detained. However, according to the driver Zhang Afu, the red pills were indeed entrusted to him by Xu Fengshan to be sent to Ge's place at 10:00 pm the night before. However, the house is where Wang Suzhen lives. It is found that Wang Suzhen was originally the head of the Mingfang Bookstore on Shantou Road. After becoming acquainted with Ge, she lived with him there. According to Wang, Ge did not know about the production of red pills, but this statement is not credible, because she wanted to destroy the evidence when the police station went to investigate. According to Ma Zhuying, he is Ge's cousin. Because he had been unemployed for two months, he depended on Ge for a living. The police station then went to No. 20, Cangzhou Villa, to search at 3:00 pm. They</p>
<h3 id="e173">Knocked on the Door and Entered <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>through the back door, opened by the defendant Ma Aqing. The Chinese and Western detectives rushed in and went straight to the third floor, where they arrested Ma Aqing, Chen Afang, Lin Xiaobao, Wang Rongsheng, Lu Wenhua, Hong Along, Hu Chengqing, Xiang Shunshan, the woman Zhang Xiaomei, Qiao Ahu, Wang Sanmei, Huang Dekun, and other twelve people. These people were manufacturing red pills. At that time, Lin Xiaobao and Qiao Ahu tried to jump out of the window and escape but were arrested. Wang Rongsheng had jumped to the next door at No. 19 and was arrested. Lu Wenhua was arrested in the toilet. It was found that the red pill center on the third floor was very large. There were two rooms, one of which was a manufacturing workshop, containing two wooden tables, one writing desk, three machines, one wooden stick for kneading red pills, one red pill board, three scales, one sieve, and another eight cans of red raw materials, seven plates, and a large basin containing about 100 pounds of red pill white raw materials, worth more than a thousand yuan. The other room was the</p>
<h3 id="e174">Drying Rack <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Room with two drying racks, each rack having twelve drawers, all containing red pill cloth nine pieces, three sieves, three bottles of spices. The police station weighed the confiscated red pills, weighing 25 pounds of dry and undyed ones, 7.5 pounds of wet ones, another pound of red pills, 8.5 pounds of morphine, 2 pounds of opium ash, and 7 large bags of packed ones, weighing 140 pounds. However, this type of red pill is smaller in shape and different from those on the market outside, so it is not known where it is sold. Finally, they went to No. 20, Lane 150, Baker Road to search, but found nothing. The house is where Ge's wife Wang Xiuying lives, but according to Wang, she has been separated from Ge for many years due to disagreements, and she knows nothing about the red pills. The police station released Wang. However, according to Ge, he once told the police station that the house at No. 20, Cangzhou Villa, was related to the Westerner Tang Gen, and he should be asked what nationality Tang Gen is, and he asked the court</p>
<h3 id="e175">To Go to the Site in Person <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>to clarify the truth. This case is requested to be rescheduled, because accomplices such as Xu Fengshan have not yet been arrested, etc. When asked, Ge Xinglong confessed that the cloth was entrusted to the driver Zhang Afu by Xu Fengshan and temporarily deposited at his place. He was not in the house at the time, so he did not know that it contained red pills. He had never been to No. 20, Cangzhou Road. At this time, the police lawyer said that the house on Cangzhou Road was owned by the real estate department of Yongheng Bank on Ningbo Road. Tang Gen from Shanxi, Ge Xinglong, Xu Fengshan, and the fugitive Hu Xiangfa, Zhao Mou, and other five people rented it. The doorman Huang Shuxiang proved that Ge</p>
<h3 id="e176">Went There Every Day <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>And a card with Ge's name Ge Xingbang, working at Masters and Company on Beijing Road, was confiscated. Ge then continued to say that he rented the house with the Englishman Tang Gen ten days ago. Because he was not good at Chinese, he went with him. He did not know about the red pills and had no huge capital, etc. The police lawyer Zhang also said that two check stubs were confiscated in Ge's house, which stated numbers such as 1,500 yuan, indicating that Ge had a large turnover and was wealthy, etc. Judge Wu also questioned the other defendants, such as Wang Suozhen, one by one. The confessions were mostly excuses. The court ordered that the case be retried on the 22nd, and the defendants were still detained separately. The confiscated items will be temporarily stored in the warehouse.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Salvation Association Denies Extension of Shelter Period <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Nine female and child beggars were sheltered the day before yesterday; seventeen women were also sheltered yesterday.</p>
<p>The Municipal Beggar Salvation Association, initiated and organized by Qian Xin-zhi, Wang Yi-ting, Lu Bo-hong, Liu Wang Li-ming, and others, began sheltering female and child beggars the day before yesterday. According to inquiries made by reporters to the association yesterday, reports in the newspaper that the association was extending the shelter period are inaccurate. More than two hundred people went to request shelter yesterday, mostly adult male beggars, with fewer women and children. Therefore, Cai Bing-jiu's wife, Cao Feng-xiang, Xie Feng-bao, Zhang Shi-lin, and others from the association's office explained to the beggars that the association planned to shelter female and child beggars for the first two years and could only shelter male beggars in the following two years. Most of the male beggars dispersed on their own after the explanation. Most of the female and child beggars sheltered the day before yesterday were begging for money and food and were unwilling to be sheltered for education, so only nine automatically agreed to be sent to various shelters. There were seventeen female and child beggars who went to request shelter yesterday, and the association sent them to the Jiangwan Women and Children Education Institute and the Zhabei Shelter from the Cold in two locations. Afterwards, every Monday, Tuesday, and Friday from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, they will continue to provide shelter. Furthermore, to expand the shelter, the association has scheduled a temporary meeting on the 18th of this month at 5:00 PM at the Banking Association to discuss expanding the shelter methods.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Hua Dong Bank Manager Pang Feng-zhi Accused <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Embezzlement Discovered After Closure, Lawsuit Filed by Chairman and Directors</p>
<p>The Ningbo Road Hua Dong Commercial Savings Bank, since its establishment, has been in operation for several years, with Pang Feng-zhi serving as manager. Last year, due to business losses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, it could not be maintained and was declared insolvent. The chairman, Sun Bo-sheng, and directors Wu Fu-kang, Lu Xu-dong, and others are in charge of the liquidation, with each shareholder bearing full responsibility for repaying the debts. At the same time, the debts owed to others are being recovered separately. Now, as a result of the liquidation by liquidators Sun Bo-sheng and others, it has been discovered that manager Pang Feng-zhi has engaged in embezzlement and breach of trust, with the amount of embezzlement reaching tens of thousands of dollars. Therefore, they have hired lawyer Chen Ting-rui to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Pang of violating Articles 357 and 356 of the Criminal Law, and including civil proceedings, demanding the return of US$49,670.56 plus agreed interest up to the date of repayment, and the return of a Ford car. The points of fraud and embezzlement listed total more than five, which are recorded separately below: (1) A person with the same name as the reporter deposited 50,000 yuan in face value of 19-year Customs Treasury Bonds for US$14,300 on January 27 of the 23rd year, owing principal and interest of US$15,386.02 by the end of November. It has now been discovered that the mortgaged Treasury Bonds have disappeared and have been replaced by 25,000 yuan in original public debt notes that do not repay principal or interest. It was also found that after obtaining the address of the person with the same name as the reporter, a letter was sent to inquire, but it was returned by the post office, indicating that this person with the same name as the reporter is actually Pang's alias. (2) On October 30 of the 20th year, Wang Fu-ji used 10,000 yuan in 20-year cigarette Treasury Bonds, 10,000 yuan in 20-year Customs Treasury Bonds, and 5,000 yuan in 19-year Rehabilitation Treasury Bonds as collateral for overdraft borrowing, with a term of three months, overdrawing US$7,000. Subsequently, on January 4, the Rehabilitation Treasury Bonds were taken away, and 10,000 yuan in 20-year Consolidated Tax Treasury Bonds were deposited. After the expiration date, it was extended for another six months, expiring on July 31 of the 23rd year. Now, checking the accounts, it is found that all the Treasury Bonds have been taken away, and two worthless papers of the Tian Dan have been deposited. When Wang Lin-ji was urged to pay, he ignored it. The defendant has neither cleared the debt to Wang Lin-ji nor allowed him to illegally take out the collateral. This is collusion by the defendant, which is difficult to deny. (3) A household named Pang Lu-ji, for credit overdraft, has no contract to check. As of the end of November last year, the debt was US$12,134.30. Now, a thorough search of the household's real name and address reveals that there is no such person, which is a fabrication of the defendant and is actually the defendant's alias. (4) Heng De household is also an overdraft with credit, without a contract for verification. By the end of November of the 23rd year, the outstanding principal and interest were US$7,493.46. The funds of this household are without basis and cannot be recovered to this day. (5) According to bank practice, there is no suspense account item, but it is now found that there is a suspense account item that reaches a huge amount of 8,300 yuan. The payment vouchers cannot be found, making it impossible to recover. (6) On August 10 of the 20th year, Hua Dong Bank purchased a Ford car from the Meitong Company, as stated in notes No. 4356 and No. 5731, for internal office use. Unexpectedly, after Pang Feng-zhi resigned, he did not return the car. Despite repeated requests, he ignored them. This case was heard in the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special Court by Judge Wu Ting-qi yesterday afternoon. The defendant, Pang Feng-zhi, did not attend due to illness, and lawyer Gao Jun-xiang attended the court and requested a postponement of the trial. After the court briefly questioned Sun Bo-sheng and the other two, lawyer Chen Ting-rui agreed to the defendant's request for an adjournment. Judge Wu then ordered that the case be adjourned for one week for another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Skull Gang Extorts Zhou Qian-kang <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Initially Demanding Five Thousand, Then Increasing to Eight Thousand, Visiting in Person, Finally Arrested</p>
<p>Zhou Qian-kang, manager of the Shanghai Brewery Company, lives at 159 Kang Nao Tuo Road in West Shanghai, and his family is quite wealthy. He usually employs Li Bao-sheng as a bodyguard and employs a Chinese constable No. 1941 as a watchman at home. Unexpectedly, at 5:30 PM on the 6th of this month, Zhou received a threatening letter signed by the Skull Gang, demanding US$5,000 and arranging for a Wu Tian-lin to go to collect the money on the 10th. Unexpectedly, on the 10th, Wu Tian-lin did not go to Zhou's house. Only at 4:00 PM that afternoon, a telephone call was received asking if Zhou was at home. After Zhou's wife told him that Zhou had gone out, the phone was disconnected. On the 11th at 2:00 PM, another letter was received, increasing the amount of extortion to US$8,000. The letter also arranged to make contact by phone at 10:00 AM on the 13th and send someone to collect the money at 2:00 PM that afternoon. On the 13th, there was no phone call, only a Sun Zu-de came to visit Zhou. Because Zhou had gone out, the watchman told him that he had gone out. Sun then took a business card and gave it to the constable, saying that he would come again at 11:00 AM tomorrow. Zhou reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, and Chinese detective Zhu Han-bo and detective Zhao Qing-kui went to Zhou's house to wait. On the 14th at 3:00 PM, Sun Zu-de again called Zhou's house to inquire about Zhou's whereabouts. Detective Zhu pretended to be Zhou Qian-kang and told him that the money should be paid, but the amount should be reduced, and asked him to come to collect it at 5:00 or 6:00 PM. The detectives wrapped white paper into the shape of banknotes, waiting for Sun to come and collect it. Before long, Sun actually came. The watchman handed the paper package to him. Just as he was unpacking it, the detectives stepped forward and arrested him, taking him back to the police station. Sun confessed that he was from Changshu. There was also a Sun Zhong-xin, 22 years old, who currently lives in Room 43 of the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road. He admitted that he wrote the threatening letters. Yesterday morning, the police station lawyer Zhang Tian-yin prosecuted him for extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Law. Because further investigation was needed, he requested a postponement. Sun Zu-de confessed, "I knew Zhou Qian-kang when I was in middle school. Now, because I have been unemployed for a long time and my livelihood is difficult, I did this illegal thing." Judge Wu Ting-qi verified the confession and then ordered the case to be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Corpse Dismemberment and Destruction Case: Body Sent for Examination, Head Missing <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Waiting for Examination by the Forensic Institute, No Head Found at the Burial Site Under the Bamboo Fence</p>
<p>Gong Shao-ting, owner of the Gong Hong-tai Construction Factory in Zhabei, colluded with his new concubine, Ms. Hou, out of infatuation with the new and disgust with the old. On the morning of the 21st day of the third month of the last lunar year, he invited his son-in-law, Shen Fu-fu, and others to strangle his old wife, Gu A-qiao, and destroy the corpse to eliminate the evidence. After the case was discovered, Zhou Pei-san, the squad leader of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau, and others arrested Gong Shao-ting, Gong Hou, and Zhou Bao-quan and Li Bao-sheng, male and female accomplices who helped move the body, and sent them to the local court for interrogation and detention. The headless body of A-qiao was found in the underground area behind the construction factory in Gongxing Bridge, Zhabei, and handed over to the local security guard Yan Liu-gen for safekeeping and waiting for instructions. This has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Inspector Lei Bin-zhang instructed police officer Xue Bing-zhang to take a letter and, together with the local security guard Qi Liu-gen, send the headless body to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for detailed examination. Also at 2:30 PM, police officers Xu Guo-guang and Shen Ting-fang, together with Zhou Pei-san, the squad leader of the Criminal Investigation Team, escorted the two prisoners, Zhou Bao-quan and Li Bao-sheng, in a car to the garden of a certain Cantonese person in Dongjiazhai, north of Gongxing Road, Zhabei (this place is the garden rented by the fugitive Liu Gui-sheng, which has now been taken back by the landlord). Upon arriving there, Li Bao-sheng pointed out that the head had previously been buried next to the bamboo fence, but it was unknown whether it was still there. Xu Guo-guang immediately ordered a worker to dig to a depth of three feet next to the bamboo fence, but no trace was found. Xu Guo-guang then questioned Li Bao-sheng again. Li replied that he had heard from the fugitive Liu Gui-sheng that he had moved the head to the Zhujiazhai public burial ground and buried it, with a willow tree as a marker, but he had not been to the site, so he could not point it out. Therefore, Xu Guo-guang and others escorted the two prisoners, walking for about a mile, to the Zhujiazhai public burial ground, but saw only desolate graves. Li could not point out the location. The police officers made a futile trip and returned empty-handed, and then took the two prisoners back to court. It was already dusk. The police officers reported the situation to Inspector Lei, who ordered that Zhou Bao-quan and Li Bao-sheng be returned to custody to await instructions.</p>

<p>Deceased's Wife Recounts the Situation, Heard a Shot and Returned to Find Him on the Ground</p>
<p>Russian Katov Blackhov (transliteration), 36 years old, lived at No. 27, Lane 696, Tangshan Road, and worked as a bodyguard at McCallie Bank. Recently, due to his income not covering his expenses, he was in severe financial straits. As a result, he was filled with resentment and suddenly had thoughts of world-weariness the day before yesterday. At around 11:00 AM, he returned to his apartment, took the handgun he was carrying, and fired a shot at his right temple, immediately bleeding and falling to the ground, unconscious. His cohabitant (Bitto Hoff), also Russian, discovered the incident and immediately reported it to the Huishan Police Station, ordering detectives to investigate and summoning an ambulance to rush him to the Public Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. He soon died, and the body was transported to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Tang, an inspector from the First Special District Court, visited the morgue to examine the body. According to the deceased's wife, Avuk Katov Shamut, the deceased had previously told her that he had suffered an unspeakable shock. Then, as I was about to leave him and walked into the stairwell, I suddenly heard my husband shout, "I am going to die!" Then I heard a gunshot, and I rushed back to see that he had been shot and fell to the ground. Now I am unable to bury my husband's body due to financial difficulties. Inspector Tang obtained the statement and then ordered that the deceased, Katov Blackhov, male, was indeed killed by a gunshot wound. The body was handed over to the Public Works Department for disposal.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Beikou Sand Ship Sunk by Western Steamer <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Sunk Midships, Sixteen People Missing</p>
<p>The Beikou sand ship You Zhenxing, recently loaded with more than a thousand salted pigs purchased by Shanghai merchants Yi Tai Yuan Ji Yong Cheng and others, as well as yellow sprouts and other goods, at Qingkou and Liangxiang in Shandong and was heading to Shanghai to unload. Because the goods were urgently needed for sale, the ship owner, Peng Rong, was instructed to sail quickly so that they could arrive in Shanghai and sell them as soon as possible. After the ship was loaded, Peng ordered the crew to raise anchor and sail with three-masted sails, traveling day and night. On the day before yesterday, when sailing to the ocean about ten miles east of Dongtai, there was fog, but the route could still be identified. Later, the fog gradually thickened, and the route became difficult to identify. The crew informed the ship owner, Peng, who came out of the cabin to inspect and instructed the helmsman to steer towards the coast and anchor to avoid the fog. Just as the helmsman was turning the rudder, a whistle was heard. The crew looked and saw a steamer approaching directly from a distance of more than ten feet. Not knowing which ship it was, they immediately turned the rudder to avoid it. However, the steamer was traveling fast and had already reached the bow of the ship, crashing violently into the You Zhenxing amidships, causing it to break apart, flood, and gradually sink. All the people on the ship fell into the water and called for help. After the steamer stopped, it lowered a sampan to rescue them. Twelve people were rescued and transported by the steamer to Dongtai Port. A small boat was hired to ferry the twelve rescued people ashore and given US$20. The steamer then sailed away. The rescued crew members reported the incident to Yi Tai and others in Shanghai yesterday on the Haimen steamer, requesting assistance and seeking negotiations with the steamer. According to the crew members, there were a total of twenty-eight people on the ship. Twelve of us were rescued by the offending steamer, but sixteen others, including the ship owner Peng and the accountant, are missing. It is not known if they have been rescued. In the afternoon, after the steamer rescued us, it sailed to Dongtai. At night, a small boat was hired to ferry us ashore, so we were unable to identify the type of ship. The companies are now asking people to investigate the ships that entered and exited that day in order to negotiate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charity Organization Federation's Hubei South Shelter from the Cold has been operating since December 1 of last year for one and a half months. It has sheltered more than 2,200 poor people at the Chaozhou Guild Hall in the South Railway Station and the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road. Yesterday, the weather turned sharply cold, and the cold wind was piercing to the bone. The poor people suffering from hunger and cold who came to the shelter were in a very miserable state. Zhang Heng-de from Fuyou Road in the city has always been righteous and brave. He is willing to use the money he saved last year to do good deeds. He specially made cotton clothes and pants to distribute to the poor and yesterday specially sent forty cotton quilts to Renji Tang on Six Ma Road, asking the association to transfer them to the poor people in the shelter from the cold. Mr. Zhang is also a charitable person. Wang Yi-ting, Huang Han-zhi, Gu Xin-yi, and others of the association believe that the city's industry and commerce are declining, and the number of unemployed and poor people is increasing day by day. The shelter from the cold has no fixed funds and relies entirely on fundraising for support. The relief work cannot be delayed. Therefore, at the joint meeting of the exchange yesterday, they distributed fundraising and were grateful that the exchanges were enthusiastic and agreed to donate, including 400 yuan from securities, 400 yuan from gold, 400 yuan from cloth, 200 yuan from flour, and 100 yuan from miscellaneous grains, which will be sent within a few days for poverty relief purposes. Zhang Zi-xin, the director of the shelter from the cold, presented a letter to Chairman Wen yesterday, stating (excerpt): "For the two shelters in this office that accommodate poor people, there are a total of 2,289 people. The weather has turned sharply cold, and the number of people being sheltered is increasing day by day. The expenses incurred, starting from the first day of this month, include 2,000 yuan for food rice, and 923 yuan, four jiao, two fen, and five li for vegetables, oil, salt, fuel, etc. for the remaining poor people. I am submitting the fourth ten-day report of income and expenditure for your inspection. The supply of cotton clothing and quilts is severely insufficient. I hope that all sectors will donate to benefit the poor."</p>

<h3 id="e187">Tong Cheng Steamer Collides with Lighter <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Company Investigating</p>
<p>The Tong Cheng steamer, Tong Cheng, owned by Tong Cheng Company on Jiangxi Road, with a load of 3,000 tons, arrived in Shanghai with coal on the 13th and was berthed at the Beipiao Wharf for unloading. Yesterday at around 2:00 PM, the unloading was completely finished, and the steamer left the wharf and headed to the No. 20 river cylinder on the Yangshupu River to anchor, preparing to load a large batch of flour for Tianjin. However, shortly after leaving the wharf and traveling north and east in the Huangpu River, a lighter carrying goods was traveling south in the Huangpu River. When approaching Tong Cheng, due to the strong wind and rapid tide, when it drove up to the steamer, the lighter was unable to avoid it, resulting in the ship being hit by the Tong Cheng steamer. The ship was damaged and about to sink. Fortunately, the boatmen inside the ship were rescued. The Tong Cheng still sailed to the No. 20 river cylinder and anchored. The shipowner reported to the company. The company then sent people on board to investigate the truth of the matter and examine the damage to the lighter to serve as a basis for handling negotiations.</p>

The Director of this office, as a matter of duty, must strictly enforce orders, but is unwilling to punish without prior education, and even more unwilling to have law-abiding residents and merchants unintentionally violate regulations and be fined. Therefore, I specially urge all shopkeepers and residents along the road to strictly abide by the following points regarding traffic and sanitation in the future in order to avoid detention. If there are deliberate violations, they will be punished immediately upon discovery, without any leniency." The matters that must be strictly observed are as follows: 1. All kinds of articles must not be piled outside the door or displayed along the road. 2. No work is allowed on the roadside or sidewalk. 3. No clothes are allowed to be dried on the street. 4. It is forbidden to arbitrarily pour sewage in front of the door and on the road. 5. It is forbidden to throw any debris in front of the door and on the road. 6. All kinds of vehicles are not allowed to be set up in violation of regulations. 7. The entrances of all shops and residents along the road must be swept and cleaned at any time every day. 8.

<h3 id="e196">Wei Haijiang Sues the Directors of the 儉德 Bank for Fraud, Embezzlement, and Malfeasance <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The alleged fraudulent activities total five points. The trial was transferred to the local court for hearing yesterday.</p>
<p>The 儉德 Bank has been bankrupt for over a month, and there is still no way to repay its debts. The bank's director and manager, Chai Chuangui, has already been sued by creditors, and the case has not yet been concluded. Now, Wei Haijiang, a creditor who suffered a loss of more than 100,000 gold yuan due to the bank's bankruptcy, has hired lawyers Gao Junxiang and Yang Linzhi to file a criminal self-suit with the First Special District Local Court against Chai Chuangui and the chairman and directors of the bank's board of directors, Yan Ziyu, Xie Keming, Chen Xifu, Ma Huanzhi, Tu Kaizheng, Chai Yousheng, and the supervisor, Li Jingwei, for fraud, embezzlement, malfeasance, and breach of trust. They request severe punishment according to the law and also file a civil suit to recover their losses. The allegations against the defendants include</p>
<h3 id="e197">Facts of the Fraud <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Totaling five points: (1) Chai Chuangui, knowing that Wei Haijiang had dealings with 儉德 Bank and was wealthy, instructed Gu Wensheng, the assistant manager of 儉德, to persuade Wei in June of last year, stating that the bank's capital was 1 million yuan, with 500,000 yuan already fully paid and registered, and that another 500,000 yuan was being raised, making the foundation solid and suitable for investment. Wei then paid 5,000 yuan on the 16th of that month. When the bank suspended operations on December 7th, Wei discovered that Gu's previous statements were entirely false. The bank's actual paid-up capital was only 100,000 yuan. Although it claimed to have raised 500,000 yuan when registering with the government, this was a fabrication, and there was no plan to increase capital. Gu's exaggeration was at Chai's instigation, hoping to</p>
<h3 id="e198">Induce Investment <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>(2) Wei had used American land deeds and three property title slips as collateral for overdrafts with the bank. In October of last year, Wei wanted to recover these slips, but they had already been pledged to 致祥莊 for 20,000 yuan. After Wei's negotiation, the bank redeemed them on December 3rd, but Chai pledged them again to the 四行儲蓄會 on the same day for 40,000 yuan, an additional 20,000 yuan more than the previous pledge, which has not yet been redeemed. (3) On October 23rd of last year, Chai, seeing that Wei Haijiang's trust in 儉德 had not waned, again sent Gu Wensheng to visit Wei, using the position of deputy manager as bait. Wei then met with Chai, who stated that he intended to develop the business and decided to hire Wei as deputy manager, requesting</p>
<h3 id="e199">Ways to Raise Funds <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Wei, at Chai's request, mortgaged a land deed for 110 mu to Shanghai Bank in early November, borrowing 60,000 yuan, with Xie Keming as guarantor. All the funds were lent to 儉德. After obtaining the funds, Chai did not issue the promised letter of appointment as deputy manager, nor did he issue a formal document for the borrowed land deed. After repeated urging, Chai and the bank's directors and supervisors issued a private document, but the name of the chairman was not included. Only after the bank's bankruptcy did Wei realize that the bank's regulations only allowed for one deputy manager position, and Chai had no authority to appoint another. (4) Wei had an agreement with the bank for</p>
<h3 id="e200">Overdraft of 10,000 <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yuan. If the overdraft did not exceed the agreed limit, the bank was required to honor Wei's checks without refusal. However, in late November, the bank repeatedly returned Wei's checks. Wei believes that his personal credit has suffered significant damage as a result, and the bank should be held liable for breach of trust. (5) Wei's purchase or acceptance of the company's shares as collateral is strictly prohibited by the company law, but the bank engaged in such actions in violation of Article 233 of the Company Law. In addition, the bank's false statements regarding</p>
<h3 id="e201">Discrepancies in Accounts <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Are too numerous to mention. According to the law, the defendants are subject to criminal penalties, etc. The conclusion states that the defendants exploited the public's trust in banks, using the bank as a fraudulent institution. In recent months, banks such as 五華 and 中國興業 have closed one after another, and the actions of 儉德 show obvious signs of malfeasance. If they are not severely punished, the financial stability of society will be impossible. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao presided over the hearing of the case. Only three defendants, Chai Chuangui, Xie Keming, and Li Jingwei, appeared in court. The other defendants hired lawyers to defend them. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Ye Shaoying, stated the reasons for the lawsuit. Then, Judge Ye briefly questioned the defendants Chai Chuangui and Xie Keming. Because this lawsuit does not fall within the jurisdiction of the primary court, he ordered it to be transferred to the local court for review.</p>

<p>Winning the West Qing Basketball Group B Championship</p>
<p>West Qing Basketball had two Group A games last night: (1) Jiangwan defeated Chizhi 56-27. West Qing defeated John 71-30. Jiangwan's coordination skills were excellent, and the qualifications of each player were more experienced than Chizhi, so the battle was relatively easy. West Qing was tall, and John was no match for them. However, in the first five minutes, due to underestimating the enemy, John repeatedly tied the score and scored more than ten points. Tonight, the Jewish team and the Tax Special will play the first finals in Group B, adopting a two-out-of-three game system.</p>

<p>In addition to prohibiting mixed bathing for men and women, the Guangdong provincial authorities are also promoting the reading of classics in primary and secondary schools. This case was passed by the Southwest Political Affairs Conference in July of last year and transferred to the Department of Education to formulate reading classics measures, which were distributed to primary and secondary schools in various counties and cities, and will be implemented uniformly starting next semester. Shantou primary schools have not yet taught the classics due to a lack of teachers. Recently, Chen Zhongyu, the head of the municipal education section, specifically followed the instructions of Director Huang of the Department of Education to first organize a research society for primary school teachers to study the classics to train teachers to teach the classics, so that they can teach separately. The society has now been established, with Chen, the head of the education section, serving as the president, Wen Danming as the director, and Chen Mengqing and Wu Zhuming as lecturers. More than fifty people have already signed up to participate in the research. The opening ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Provincial Commercial School on the afternoon of January 4th. It is expected that research will begin in a few days. The reading materials compiled by the society are as follows: 1. Classic of Filial Piety, 2. Tang Xuanzong's Analects Reader, 3. Zheng Yiqing's Compilation of Mencius Zhu Zi's Annotations. Other classics such as the Doctrine of the Mean and the Great Learning will also be taught in succession.

<p>Since He Bingsong, Sun Hanbing, and ten other scholars in the domestic academic community recently published the declaration of China-centered cultural construction, it has attracted the attention of people across the country. In order to understand the attitudes of leaders from all walks of life towards this declaration, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency specifically visited Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, yesterday. He was granted an audience and expressed his extremely earnest attitude and extremely interesting remarks. Mr. Wang said at the outset, "I very much agree with the views of these scholars. I have the following thoughts on their views. Yesterday, at a banquet, a friend surnamed Zhao raised a statement that seemed like a joke, but in fact contained a profound truth. He said that their ancestor Zhao Pu, five hundred years ago, used half of the Analects to govern the world. He wondered whether it referred to the first half or the second half. He had doubts for a long time, and finally found an answer. The word 'half' should refer to a part. It probably means removing the unsuitable parts from the Analects and adopting the suitable parts. I think this answer is really correct. According to his answer, the saying '(half) of the Analects governs the world' can become a profound truth. Generally speaking, there must be a reason why books and doctrines can last for a long time, but one time is different from another. If we blindly follow the words of the ancients, there will inevitably be conflicts with the present. The Analects was produced more than a thousand years before Zhao Pu. If Zhao Pu did not ask about the situation of the Song Dynasty, and completely based his governance on the Analects, I am afraid the world would not be governed. Zhao Pu understood this principle and Song-ified the Analects, so he could achieve results and give credit to the Analects. But only half of the Analects, in other words, only a part of the Analects that was suitable for the Song Dynasty environment could govern the Song Dynasty. If it were the entire Analects, it would not have such good results. Now, a thousand years have passed since the Song Dynasty. Those who cling to the past still take 'it has been in ancient times' as a lesson, while those who like the new take 'it has been in Europe and America' as their mantra. Their mistakes are actually the same. I think that the people who want to use the Analects to govern the country now, the half of the Analects they should adopt, or a part of the Analects, must not be the same as Zhao Pu's half of the Analects. For the same reason, if we want to adopt the precedents of Europe and America to govern the country or handle affairs, we can only learn from Zhao Pu's method, and adopt a part of it that is suitable for our country. Let me give another example before us. Many people attribute the rapid recovery of the Commercial Press after the robbery to the scientific management methods that I brought back to China from Europe and America a few years ago. In fact, the scientific management methods that I am now implementing at the Commercial Press can be said to be very different from those prevalent in Europe and America, because I never blindly follow the scientific management methods of Europe and America, and have already Sinified it, especially Commercial Press-ified it. If not, not only may it not be effective, but there may also be many obstacles. Even a small matter is already like this, let alone national affairs and the entire culture, especially those that should not be blindly followed," and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Election of Chairman <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>As a result, He Bingsong was elected. The chairman then stood up and gave a speech, briefly stating that the society had a very glorious history in the past, and now has nearly a thousand members, all of whom are well-educated people in the country. Bingsong felt honored to be able to work together for the Chinese cultural cause. Regarding the future affairs of the society, according to his humble opinion, the main contribution should be to conduct specialized academic research and edit specialized works in various subjects. If we want to achieve this goal, it seems that the following tasks should be actively carried out: (1) Expanding the library, (2) Sorting out the original publications of the society, (3) Actively editing various specialized series. In short, since the society is an academic organization, it should of course continue to strive for academic work based on the society's purpose as the primary goal. Whether it is appropriate or not, I still hope that all directors will not hesitate to give advice, and hope that all members will guide us at any time, in order to seek the promotion and development of the society's affairs. Then, the former chairman Chuan Shishuo, the director of the General Affairs Department Liu Baimin, and the director of the Editorial Department Zhang Menglin, etc., reported on the society's financial affairs and editing situation respectively. Due to the late hour, it was decided to continue the meeting the next day.</p>

<p>The general meeting of directors continued at 3:00 PM the next afternoon, discussing the implementation plan for various businesses this year. The more important resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) Enrich the library and aim to establish the Asian Library, the Chinese Library, the Japanese Library, the Members' Works Library, and the General Library, etc. (1) Sort out and carry out the editing of the National Renaissance Series, the Arts and Sciences Series, the Japanese Famous Works Series, the Arts and Sciences Compilation, and the compilation and printing of ancient books, etc. (2) Plan a plan for studying Chinese music (4) Establish a Natural Science Research Institute and a science experiment hall for middle schools, etc. At the same time, it was decided that Ma Zongrong, Pan Gongzhan, He Bingsong, and Chuan Shishuo would be responsible for presiding over the drafting of detailed plans for each case, and submit them to the next board of directors meeting for decision.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Appointment of Various Directors <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>

<p>Wang Jimei and Others Appointed as Enrollment Committee Members</p>
<p>The Private Pudong Middle School in this city has a long history and outstanding achievements. It is known for its mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The teachers hired for the major courses of Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the school are all full-time and have knowledge and experience. For the next semester's enrollment, Mr. Lin Zhongke, the principal of the school, acting in accordance with the wishes of the board of directors, advocated strictness and reducing the number of new students in order to improve the students' level and restore the glory of the school before the 16th year of the Republic. Yesterday, he specifically formed an enrollment committee, and hired Wang Jimei, Wei Lizhou, Lu Zulong, Chen Huanwen, Chen Boqing, Xia Chengfa, Dai Kaisheng, Song Chongjiu, Huang Qinxiang, Zhang Qianxiu, Jin Jun, Li Youxi, Zhu Jingqing, Wu Zhiping, Zheng Pianwu and fifteen other full-time teachers of the school as members of the committee to preside over the enrollment matters.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Expansion of Lixin Accounting School <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Lixin Accounting Tutorial School, located at 190 Ningbo Road in this city, was founded by accountant Dr. Pan Xulun, and its purpose is to cultivate accounting practical talents for the industrial and commercial circles. It has been established for seven and a half years, and has two departments: correspondence and night school. Most of the students in the correspondence department are from other cities and cannot attend face-to-face lectures. The number of admissions has reached more than 2,800. The editing of accounting lecture notes, the correction of course papers, and the answering of questions are all very serious, so there is no difference from the effectiveness of face-to-face teaching. The courses currently offered, in addition to the original bookkeeping and elementary accounting, advanced accounting, banking accounting, and company accounting, three new courses have recently been added: Auditing, Complete Cost Accounting (to be taken after completing advanced accounting), and Simplified Cost Accounting (to be taken after completing bookkeeping elementary accounting), to prepare for the study of internal audit by those from other cities who are interested in internal audit in various industrial and commercial institutions and cost accounting in various manufacturing plants. The department enrolls students all year round, and they can enroll at any time.</p>
<p>Also, the night school department makes use of evening leisure time, making it convenient for accounting staff who are already employed in this city and students of vocational schools who are still studying. The number of graduates from previous sessions has reached more than 3,200. Shanghai is the most developed area of accounting academics in China. In recent years, the demand for accounting talents from various industrial and commercial institutions has increased even more. As a result, the number of people who go to the school to apply for admission has also increased sharply year by year. Only because the school's address is limited and the classrooms are cramped, although it tries to enroll nearly 400 people each term, there are still no less than one or two hundred people who cannot be accommodated. It is reported that in order to remedy this shortcoming, the school has additionally opened several spacious classrooms on the upper floors of the Xinhua Bank at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Ningbo Road, and decided to add classes starting next term to accommodate them. In addition, the school's class time was originally from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every night. This time is quite inconvenient for those who have no duties after 5:00 PM. It is reported that starting next term, an early class will be added, with classes from 5:30 PM to 7:15 PM, so that scholars who finish their duties at various institutions early can go to school first and then return home to rest. The current term of the school is about to end, and the next term is scheduled to start on February 11th. In addition to the original elementary and intermediate Chinese and English bookkeeping accounting, advanced accounting, banking accounting, cost accounting and auditing, two new courses will be added: government accounting and company accounting. The textbooks used are all Lixin Accounting Series written by Pan Accounting and others and published by the Commercial Press. The content is very rich. It is reported that since the registration started the day before yesterday, there has been a very enthusiastic rush of people going to apply.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Jiangsu Social Education Facilities (2) <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>(Report by Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, at the Provincial Government Memorial Week)</p>
<p>Secondly, the work of formulating standards for social education: In the past, the work of various social education institutions lacked standards, either avoiding difficulties and seeking ease without considering effectiveness, or engaging in extravagant displays to dazzle the public. As a result, there were no achievements. To remedy this drawback, it was necessary to stipulate work standards for various social education institutions. Therefore, in the 21st year, standard work for public education centers and farmer education centers was formulated, ordering social education institutions in each county to earnestly comply and to formulate scoring sheets for each county bureau to earnestly investigate the implementation of standard work in the 21st year. The situation and results of the examination have been written as a special article and published in Jiangsu Education. At the beginning of the 22nd year, the standards of various social education institutions were revised, and (Measures for Popularizing Public Education by Central Institutions in Public Education Zones in Each County) were separately formulated, stipulating that each institution must divide the entire public education zone into basic education zones and promotion zones, and that each institution must popularize standard work within the basic education zone within two years. Now, each institution has been in the basic education zone for a year. The implementation is still good. The result will be compiled into a detailed report during the general examination next year.</p>
<p>Thirdly, social education in each county is to be divided into zones for guidance: The establishment and work standards of social education institutions in each county have already been stipulated, but how the implementation is going must be inspected and guided. Therefore, it is stipulated that in addition to provincial school inspectors and county school inspectors and education committee members inspecting social education institutions in each county on schedule, the entire province will be divided into six public education zones, with provincial social education institutions responsible for guiding social education institutions in each county. Because the establishment of provincial social education institutions is, on the one hand, to study and experiment with methods for implementing social education, and on the other hand, to assume the responsibility of guiding local social education. This method has been implemented since the 22nd year, and the results of the implementation have been quite satisfactory. At the same time, it is also stipulated that provincial social education institutions must convene regional social education research conferences organized by social institutions in each county to further enhance the research interest of social education service personnel.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the active promotion of literacy education and livelihood education: The number of illiterate people in China accounts for more than 10%, resulting in low public intelligence and a decline in public morale. The implementation of social guidance must naturally pay special attention to literacy education. In addition, China's production is backward, the people's livelihood is extremely dilapidated, and the rural economy is even more desolate. Social education facilities must naturally pay considerable attention to livelihood education. Therefore, when we formulated the standard work for the 21st year, we stipulated that social education institutions should focus on literacy education and livelihood education. At the same time, we also formulated two specific plans: a concrete plan for promoting public schools in each county within three years, and a concrete plan for social education institutions to promote livelihood education, and ordered them to be followed. Regarding the specific plan for promoting public schools in each county within three years, except for a few counties that failed to comply due to economic concerns, most counties implemented it accordingly. The number of public schools and students in each county has increased sharply compared to before, which is the reason. As for the specific plan for livelihood education, due to talent and economic factors, it has not yet been fully implemented and will be promoted in the future.</p>
<p>Fifthly, pay attention to the assessment and protection of the heads of social education institutions: The heads of social education institutions are the leaders of social education institutions. Whether social education can be promoted and whether standard work can be effectively implemented is closely related to whether the heads of institutions are competent. If the head of the institution is competent, the planning and execution of the cause will surely be twice the result with half the effort; otherwise, it will inevitably be perfunctory. Therefore, since the promulgation of the standard work, the assessment of the heads of social education institutions has also been given great attention. The heads of institutions who are already in office must be strictly assessed, and those who are about to take office or are preparing to take office must also be given a strict assessment in advance. All counties recommend the heads of social education institutions, and they are first ordered to come to the department for talks in order to examine them. During the examination, in addition to paying attention to their academic knowledge and experience, special attention is paid to their social experience, educational ideals, work interest, and methods of handling affairs. They must have experience in society, have ideals for education, have interest in work, and have methods for handling affairs in order to endure hardship and go deep into the people to work; otherwise, they cannot be appointed. In addition, the county magistrates and bureau chiefs in each county often arbitrarily appoint and dismiss the heads of social education institutions due to personal disagreements, so that the heads of social education institutions cannot stay in their positions for a long time and naturally cannot work with peace of mind. Therefore, each county is also notified to earnestly protect the heads of social education institutions, and all appointments and dismissals must be submitted for approval, and each county must not handle them without authorization, so that the heads of each social education institution can work with peace of mind.</p>

<p>Chapter Seven Carefully Inquiring About the Eastern Section</p>
<p>This scholar clapped his hands on his thigh, stood up, turned half a circle, and said with a slight stumble: Your words are truly thorough. Saying this, his face straightened, and he looked at Zhiqian and said: Just now, Mr. Cheng said that Yuan Youwei, is he the Director of the Department of Finance? Cheng Zhiqian smiled and said: Of course it is him. If he wasn't the Director of the Department of Finance, would the Director of the Department of Construction be willing to welcome his brother? Li Shilian said: Director Gao is inviting Director Yuan's brother to dinner, with Mr. Cheng as a guest. Needless to say, Mr. Cheng is very familiar with both sides. Cheng Zhiqian smiled slightly and did not reply. Seeing this, Li Shilian was certain that their friendship had reached a considerable degree, and sat silently on the side, thinking only about the truth of the matter. He was thinking to himself, and he didn't know how many minutes he had been silent. When he woke up and looked forward, he saw Wang Beihai holding a book and walking towards Zhiqian. He understood in his heart that this was someone tutoring. If he were sensible, he should leave and not disturb them here. Even if he had something to say, he should wait until this person had finished his homework before speaking. Doing so would win their favor. Thinking that this was right, he stood up, gave Zhiqian a half bow, and said with a smile: Don't delay Mr. Wang's tutoring. See you later. Saying that, he walked towards the door. Looking back, he saw that Zhiqian was also by his side, so he bent down, held his fists, and arched his hands several times. He didn't dare to suddenly turn around, but kept backing away, retreating to a place where Zhiqian couldn't see him in the house. He kept looking forward, being polite to people, not thinking that he was backing up to the edge of the corridor, and colliding with the corridor pillar. With a thud, his spine was almost numb. Fortunately, there was no one in the courtyard, and he held back his tears and stood there for a while. Zhang Jiefu, who lived next door to him, stuck his head out and looked at him. Seeing him standing there, he thought he was thinking about something and was lost in thought. (113)</p>

<h3 id="e245">Random Notes on Banknotes <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Using a colorful piece of paper circulating in society, grasping the source of circulating finance, the greatness of banknotes, we live if we get them, and die if we don't. What we hear and see, and the facts that are passed down, are recorded randomly for after-dinner conversation.</p>
<p>The color of banknotes varies depending on the issuing bank. According to some comedians, red represents the blood and sweat of laborers and farmers, crimson represents beautiful women, green represents China's agricultural foundation and the need for greening, and gray represents the faces of general coolies.</p>
<p>My deceased friend Yin Qingguang had a line about banknotes: "Coming from a piece of paper, originally empty, Kuriroku fiercely competes for it." Another line said: "Bright as a beauty in red and green, not caring about changing allegiances morning and night." The words contain deep meaning and are worth reading.</p>
<p>I once saw in the bedroom of a wealthy young man, the flower paper that should have been pasted on the wall was replaced with banknotes. His method of pasting was to use white silk paper as the base and paste banknotes on it. He did not brush paste, but used pins to stick them. The banknotes themselves were not damaged in the slightest. The colorful sight could be called spectacular. But the golden and silver air is overpowering, and it is not as elegant as a book and a painting adorning the wall.</p>
<p>My relative Yin Peijun once told me something. He said that a student Wang in a certain school in Shanghai, one night gambled with his lover, using banknotes as paper to blow, and setting fire to them for fun. In an instant, dozens of pieces were burned. Wang was the son of a wealthy merchant and regarded money as dirt. Although his lover tried to stop him, Wang didn't care. Such a waste of natural resources, I fear, has reduced a lot of good fortune in the dark.</p>
<p>Subsidiary currency notes are lower-grade banknotes, and their wide circulation carries a universal color. Because of the frequency of circulation, they are easily damaged. Recently, the subsidiary currency notes circulating in the market are mostly dirty and worn out. A note is divided into several pieces, but still used together. People in the common class often call them "broken cloth notes" in a homophonic pun, which is extremely funny.</p>
<p>The form of ghost money is indeed no different from that of banknotes. Illiterate countrymen in Jiangbei and inland areas are often fooled by it. Therefore, when countrymen use banknotes, they are both afraid of them being fake and afraid of them being ghost money. They do not regard banknotes as affectionately as silver dollars.</p>

<p>Teachers and friends are everywhere, but their words and deeds are different. I dare to introduce one or two of those I know.</p>
<p>A certain chemistry teacher at a certain middle school, Mr. So-and-so, explained Yeast as 酵母 (xiào mǔ), but (酵) was mistakenly read as (xiào), and the sound of "filial mother" (孝母) was heard everywhere, which can be said to be a source of great fun.</p>
<p>My classmate Mr. Zhu, being in mourning at home, one day wrote a letter to his classmate at the same desk, inquiring about the recent situation at school, signing his name as Zhu Zhi XX. When he received the reply, he couldn't help but burst out laughing before he had even opened it. The crowd didn't understand, and asked to see it. The envelope said: (Mr. Zhu Zhi XX Receives) (This matter was personally told to me by Mr. Zhu).</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so is eloquent, lively, and especially good at socializing, and is known as a socialite. He once asked me with extremely polite formalities: (Where does your father work?) I was stunned.</p>
<p>My classmate Mr. So-and-so, returned to his hometown to get married. He only returned to Shanghai three weeks later. After I found out about this, I announced it in public. Mr. Yang asked me: (Did you bring your wife out?) I answered as if I didn't know, but I knew that he had backfired and made a mess of things.</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Starting from a place more than ten zhang away, there were many bamboo poles, standing tall and short: the tallest was taller than a person, and the shortest was only half a foot from the ground. And the thickness of these bamboo poles themselves was also different... the thickest was thicker than a person's arm, and the thinnest was only the size of a thumb. Their styles were even more peculiar: some were straight, some were curved, some were pointed at the top, and some were tied with a ring. Their distances were also absolutely not uniform, starting from places ten or so zhang away, all the way to the edge of the white wall at the very end, both near and far. When we saw it, we were simply bewildered. We could only stare with our eyes wide open, and we didn't know where to start asking!</p>
<p>(This is the arrow range! Those standing bamboo poles are all targets used by people practicing archery.) So the Empress Dowager automatically explained to us. (The emperors of all dynasties and the close ministers who accompanied them on hunts often came here to practice. Each person took turns shooting, three arrows each time; and each time they had to identify a different bamboo pole as the target. They had to make sure that all three arrows hit the target. Generally speaking, among these bamboo poles, those that are far away, and those that are very tall, very short, or curved, are more difficult to hit. One must first practice from those that are near, straight, and neither too high nor too low, progressing gradually from easy to difficult. When one practices to the point where one can hit any bamboo pole with three arrows in a row, this person's archery skills can be considered to have reached the peak; the results of the seasonal hunt will undoubtedly be very good! And his fame will surely spread throughout the country and be admired by people.)</p>
<p>We did not walk onto the arrow range, but only stood at the door and looked from a distance. The two iron rings hanging in the air with ropes behind us, and these two doors, were probably only three or four steps away, directly opposite the center of this door frame. The Empress Dowager turned around and pointed to these two iron rings and said: (223)</p>

<h3 id="e249">Vegetable Prices After the Famine <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Jiaoxin</p>
<p>Every year between the tenth and eleventh months of the lunar calendar is when families in the mainland pickle vegetables. This year, the various vegetables are particularly cheap. Green vegetables are four to five hundred cash per dan, snow cabbage is one thousand cash per dan, radishes are eight hundred cash per dan, and large mustard greens (i.e., large mustard cabbage) are one cent of a dollar each. This cheap price is said to have broken the record for many years. Then it should be good news for the poor, but it is not. Precisely because the vegetables are particularly cheap, it is even more harmful to the farmers, leaving them with no way to make a living.</p>
<p>This year, the drought has caused disaster. The rice planted by the farmers has all dried up. For the time being, other grains cannot be planted in the fields, so everyone grows vegetables. Therefore, the yield has exceeded that of previous years, so supply exceeds demand, and prices have fallen sharply. According to the farmers, such cheap prices do not even cover the cost. When it comes to selling, because there are few people, and they have to hire people to help carry them into the city to sell, the city people do not need so many vegetables. They cannot sell them as soon as they are carried into the city as in previous years, so they have to carry them to the streets and alleys to solicit customers from door to door. Therefore, by the time they are sold, it is already late, and the price they get is barely enough to eat a meal in the city. There is little left, not even enough for the workers' wages, let alone making a profit.</p>
<p>Logically, with vegetables so cheap, city people should buy more than in previous years: but the facts are not entirely so. Because the price of salt in recent years has been increasing year by year, and now it costs more than four hundred cash per shi jin. For example, pickling one dan of green vegetables requires four or five jin of salt, which adds up to two thousand cash. After the great drought this year, commerce has become even more sluggish due to the bankruptcy of the countryside. City people, of course, are mostly merchants. Even if they are worried about the necessities of food and clothing, they have no spare capacity to consider the future. Therefore, no matter how cheap the vegetables are, and because of the high price of salt, most people are unable to afford them.</p>

The flower stems grow from the center of the leaf clusters, four or five inches long. The flowers are light green, and the fruits are crimson and lovely. There are also yellow ones that do not wither after a long time, hence the name.</p>
<p>It is planted in pots by cutting during the vernal equinox and autumnal equinox. It likes shade and moisture.</p>
<p>Watering with leftover cold black tea juice is most suitable.</p>
<p>In Wu customs, families plant Rohdea japonica in their gardens, mainly to observe the prosperity and decline of the Rohdea japonica, in order to predict the prosperity and decline of the family's fortune. Moreover, for all moving, betrothal, and all joyous events, it must be prepared to bring good luck. Even if fresh ones are not available, satin must be cut to resemble its shape to replace it. On the fourteenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, the birthday of the immortals. Women often go to remove old leaves on the night of the day before, and scatter them in the alleyways, saying that the immortals are playing in the world and accidentally trampling on them, which will bring good omens, and new leaves will sprout and naturally grow beautifully.</p>
<p>(2) Chlorophytum</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said: Emptiness generates white, and auspiciousness stops. The plant that takes its name from it is Chlorophytum. This grass grows naturally in wetlands. The stems extend close to the ground, and the leaves grow in clusters on it, resembling orchids. They are more than a foot long, narrow and pointed, with parallel veins, and are evergreen in all seasons. Under the clusters of leaves, roots and beards grow again. Fine flowers bloom in summer, white inside and purple outside. It is often planted together with Rohdea japonica in family gardens and courtyards, but it is rare to see it blooming, and seeing it brings good fortune.</p>
<p>It can be divided and cut after rain, and nine out of ten will survive. It is especially elegant to accompany solitary rocks and ganoderma.</p>
<p>(3) Liriope graminifolia</p>
<p>My friend, the desert poet, once compared monk shoes, chrysanthemums, and Liriope graminifolia to my essays. Liriope graminifolia comes from the place where Zheng Kangcheng read books in Zichuan County, Shandong Province. It was originally my family's thing. The poet's metaphor can be said to be accurate.</p>
<p>Liriope graminifolia, also known as Xiudun grass, is also known as Mai Dong. The leaves are like chives, more than a foot long, soft and clustered, fresh and lovely. It does not wither even in winter. Short flower stems grow in the center, blooming with light purple fine flowers. Planting it on the courtyard steps, it hangs down on all sides, suitable for clear play. The fruits are round and blue. There are also small white fruits on the roots. If you take it, wash it, and soak it in boiling water, you can use it as tea. It tastes delicious and sweet, and it is cool in nature, and has the effect of treating throat diseases.</p>
<p>(4) Ilex chinensis</p>
<p>Ilex chinensis is clustered, evergreen in all seasons, and can be trimmed to form hedges. If planted in mountainous areas, it can grow freely and can be as high as a zhang. The leaves are oval, light at the ends, alternate, thick and glossy. Small white flowers bloom in early summer. Male flowers are clustered inflorescences, and female flowers grow in the leaf axils. The fruits are red and small, like red beans, which are different from the long leaves and black fruits of Ligustrum lucidum. It grows from the ground as soon as it is pressed, and is easy to transplant and survive. If you want it to be lush, you must use dog feces to fertilize it. The bark of those with small leaves can be used to make glue to catch birds, called small-leaf Ilex chinensis.</p>
<p>Ilex chinensis is also known as evergreen branch. Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty tested the students of the Painting Academy, using "Peaceful Birds on Evergreen Branches" as the topic, but no one knew it, because the name was very unpopular. During the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, the houses on each street in Hangzhou planted Ilex chinensis to bring good luck.</p>
<p>Planting Ilex chinensis in cemeteries is a common practice. Li Zunkue passed by the ruined Shihu Southern Song Dynasty palace, and the line "Six Mausoleums, Wind and Rain, One Ilex chinensis" was widely recited by scholars.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Swap Advance Short Position Paid Seven Yuan or So <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was calm yesterday, the last day of February trading. Both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Although there were fluctuations depending on the swap spread throughout the day, transactions were dull and the situation was stagnant. In the early morning, overseas silver market saw British rise and American flat. The forward silver price rose and fell slightly. Exchange rates also plummeted. London spot gold rose three and a half pence. The off-exchange pre-market trading opened at around 63 yuan, and the situation was very stable. The Central Bank's posted exchange rate was announced, with British flat and American down by 0.125. The Customs Gold Unit rose by 0.04, and the standard price of assayed gold was 999 yuan, which also had little impact. It opened slightly lower, then rose again due to large traders buying back in. The February-to-March term had already started pre-trading. From the bullish side bidding up 5 or 6 yuan, the bearish side actually advanced to pay 7 yuan strongly. After the high, it immediately fell. Soon after, the swap spread became cheaper because bearish parties such as Yuan Mao Yong, Qian Chang, Xiang Yu Qing, Yong Da De Cheng, etc., were competing to pay. Foreign interbank lending also dropped to two jiao. Buyers in the market were enthusiastic, hovering and rising, but sources of supply were plentiful at the high, and remittance offices, etc., were releasing some, the exchange rate could not be consistent. In addition, the swap spread rose from six yuan to seven yuan, and then fell back. The silver equalization tax was announced unchanged, still levied at 6%. The British exchange rate was calculated at one shilling, five pence, six five six two five. At this point, trading was quiet, and the swap spread was also stable. The gold market hovered around four yuan for quite a while. Although there was a small increase after entry, unexpectedly, Duo Sen, Chang, Yong Zheng, and Chang, etc., took the lead in paying out, and the swap spread rose again, resulting in ample supply. The market was still tired at noon closing. The afternoon market opened steadily, and the swap spread remained firm. Recent shillings lacked buyers and fell slightly, but support was still strong after the low, and there was still a rebound. Indian silver initially reported a rise of one anna. There was a lack of transactions in the market. Although there were several declines, the market was extremely dull, and both buyers and sellers were lacking in spirit. After this, the market was as if dead. Even if there were differences, they were not worth recording. The closing market also presented a boring situation. The February-to-March term started yesterday. The overall trend for the whole day was that the bearish side paid in around 7 yuan, which was extremely stable. However, due to the end of the lunar year, there seemed to be some fear among the potential bullish forces. Here is a record of the market situation for the day:</p>

After struggling, the closing was 963 yuan and four jiao. The highest price during the day was 966 yuan and five jiao, and the lowest price was 961 yuan and seven jiao, a fluctuation of 4.8 jiao.

<p>The swap (February-to-March term) was generally stable. Pre-trading had already started before 9:30 in the morning. Initially, the bearish side bid up 6 yuan, lacking transactions.

Then Fu Yu Da, Lian Bang Qian, Chang Xiang Zhen, Tai Yuan Mao, Yong Zhao Feng, Chang Chun Yuan Yong, Yu Qing Yong Heng Yu, and Da De Cheng, etc., paid in one after another. Although Fu Xing Yong Heng Yu paid out some in the middle, the paid price still gradually went downstream, falling to around 6 yuan. At this time, there were quite a few people paying out on a limited basis, and it became stable. Not long after, Shun Mao Chang, Sheng Yong, Wan Xing, Yong Li Fu, Chang Zhao Feng, and Chang, etc., came to pay out again, rising to 6.9 yuan, because bearish parties continued to enter orders in each trade.

Unexpectedly, Sen Chang Yong Chang, Sheng Yong Fu Xing Yong, Zheng Chang, etc., fiercely came to pay out, and immediately rose. However, because the 7-yuan mark was limited by Guang Bang and Yu Qing Yong entering orders, it was difficult to break through, and it contended around 7 yuan. After closing, Bing Xing, etc., paid out and rose slightly, because the 7-yuan mark lacked bearish parties to pay in. In the afternoon market, the bullish side initially bid up 6.7 or 8 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange market was still sluggish, and prices were still tired and unable to rise. Foreign interbank lending fell to two jiao again. Floating short positions continued to be released on the market, and transactions were still not active. However, sentiment was still stable. Most people believed that there would be no major differences within the year. However, the number of floating short positions released for days was already large. The number of exchange deposits was decreasing day by day. Without changes in the environment, prices should not fall again, because although the large short positions had not been covered, the floating short positions had been greatly reduced. Afterwards, it may be maintained, or it may be hoped to arbitrage swaps, and prices may rise. Yesterday has passed. At the opening in the morning, the initial auction sentiment was still stable, and retail investors slightly increased their appetite. The leading prices were slightly better by one or two jiao. After entering, No. 47 slightly sold, and then turned tired again, so it fell back by one or two jiao. Since the trends before and after were different, the second round fell back across the board, but it was only one or two jiao. At the opening in the afternoon, sentiment was still very lazy, and transactions became more and more sluggish. Both buying and selling had the potential to be done or not done, so it could continue to fall by one or two jiao. At the closing, sporadic retail investors slightly arbitraged, and prices became uneven, but the difference was only about one jiao. After being tired for many days, prices should have a solid momentum. Yesterday's price results continued to be tired by 0.05-0.34 jiao. The total number of transactions was 8,147,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Had Clear Transactions</p>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (14th) the New York stock market was stable, with clear transactions. Traders were waiting for the Supreme Court's ruling on the gold coin clauses. The market opened steadily in the morning, and later became firm due to a decrease in short sales. A few short positions believed that the court would reveal some details in its judgment, and the judgment could be released today, so they started to cover. Furthermore, the short positions were quite pleased with the Hague's decision. The bond market varied. The small exchange market was idle, and the total number of transactions throughout the day was 550,000 shares. Here are the Dow Jones indices:</p>

<p>The yarn market was calm, and the situation turned loose again. The market transaction was clearer, so the rise and fall were even smaller. At the opening of the auction, both the bullish and bearish sides were inactive. Changes should be expected after the Lunar New Year. It is said that Wu still had news of continuing to receive goods this month, and the market rose slightly by 0.35 yuan.</p>

<p>At the opening of the benchmark yarn market, foreign cotton turned up, and the daily spot yarn sales were good. The market atmosphere in the market was slightly . However, no new buyers were seen , so the rising momentum was not great. As a result, each month rose by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 jiao. The afternoon market opened slightly up 0.1 and 0.2 jiao. When the auction reached the second or third round, the yarn transaction was not as high as the previous day, with over 600 bales traded. The situation turned and relaxed again. However, Wu's receiving tax for this month still rose by 0.1 or 0.2 jiao. The average monthly change was flat, with no rise or fall.

<p>The cotton market was stable, with both ups and downs. The market atmosphere was extremely scattered. However, most people's psychology was low, because the saying that yarn factories would stop early was particularly prevalent. Second, Shanghai's cotton inventory was sufficient. As for the buyers, the Indian cotton harvest was relatively poor, and the market price tended to rise. The price difference with Chinese cotton was very large, and the amount absorbed was tight, not released.</p>

<p>Before the market opened, cotton futures rose. Indian cotton rose again, increasing from 1.75 to 4.5 rupees per candy. American cotton also rose by 15, 6, and 7 points per pound. Gold prices were also stable. Buying interest in the market was slightly strong, but after the 23rd lot was auctioned, Changfeng sold the most. Another view was that Shanghai inventories were very high, factory demand was weak, and the market weakened again. As a result, prices rose by 5 cents to 1 dime. The afternoon session opened with a rise of 5 cents. It was heard that the off-market price of Indian cotton had risen again by 1.25 rupees per candy. Prices fell again after the 23rd lot was auctioned, but this month's prices were relatively high because there were not many deliveries. As of yesterday, only 800 piculs of goods had been approved by the Inspection Bureau. Distant months of Hankou coarse cotton rose or fell by 5 cents. A survey of sales showed Yuanda selling 1,200 piculs, Dafu 900 piculs, Changfeng 2,300 piculs, Runkang 2,800 piculs, Yongchang 1,700 piculs, Tongxing 2,200 piculs, Changhe 3,000 piculs, Yuanda 1,200 piculs, Dafeng 1,600 piculs, Jifeng 1,000 piculs, Dafu 1,200 piculs, Shengyuan 1,700 piculs, Huilong 1,000 piculs, and Mingde 900 piculs.

<p>(Hankou Correspondent) The cotton market in this city is flat and sales are sluggish. The listed buyers include Shenxin and Nissho Teian textile factories, Shanghai's Xinchun Anji, and Huang's Yusheng Cotton Firm, etc. However, due to unfavorable news from Shanghai, purchases from all parties have weakened. Only Shenxin Textile Factory, due to daily needs, made relatively large purchases, with a total transaction of 332 large bales, plus 194 medium bales, 200 small bales, and 507 pieces, equivalent to 2,926 piculs and 20 catties in the local market scale.

<p>Yesterday, when American cotton opened, prices rose by 1 to 4 points for each month. However, due to the issue of gold bar payments, business was slow, leading to a sluggish market. Later, the stock market was strong and bullish, with traders buying and short positions covering, leading to further price increases. At noon, a reaction occurred due to some long positions closing and large-scale selling from Bombay. However, due to purchases by traders and Japanese firms, market prices remained firm. At the close, prices softened slightly as long positions resold. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices rose by 1 to 7 points. The British cotton market was calm, with some purchases from Bombay and mainland merchants. Spot prices rose by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 3 to 4 points. Indian cotton futures traders bought heavily, while Japanese and European exporters sold. Phalgura rose by 2.25 rupees per two, Omra rose by 2 rupees, and Broach rose by 2.5 rupees.

<p>Rumors of Fixed Prices for Foreign Wheat Approach, Flour and Wheat Market Difficult to Break Free from Sluggishness</p>
<p>After the New Year opening of the flour market, the markets for various months have again shown signs of sluggishness and weakness. The quoted prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada have fallen by about 4.5 dimes or so. When the market opened, due to the continued decline in foreign wheat prices and the approaching settlement date, many outside speculators sold off their holdings, resulting in an unstable opening and a drop of nearly 1 cent. Later, as inflows and outflows balanced, prices fluctuated. By the afternoon opening, the current month's market was sluggish due to weak actual sales, while distant months were rumored to have continued offers of foreign wheat. Although no transactions occurred, prices were close to market sentiment. As a result, the near-term market fell due to speculator sell-offs, while the distant-term market was weakened by the foreign wheat situation. The situation is likely to remain uncertain. As a result, the current month fell by 2 cents the day before, February fell by 2.5 cents, March fell by 2.75 cents, and April to June fell by 2.25 cents.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the markets for various months showed signs of flatness and weakness. Quoted prices for foreign wheat were consistently about 4.5 dimes lower, resulting in a gloomy sentiment. The current month was stable due to a lack of selling, while distant months were more active, falling by 22 cents. By the afternoon opening, the flour market loosened, and the continuous hedging of foreign wheat weakened sentiment again, with near and distant months falling by 23 cents. Given the current situation, as the end of the year approaches, the market may inevitably experience fluctuations due to monetary conditions. As a result, the current month was down 4 dimes, February was down 7 dimes, and March and April were down 6 cents. The spot wheat market is declining steadily, factories are rejecting offers, and the entire market is closed.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat prices are extremely depressed due to the lack of improvement in Canadian wheat exports. The reflection in the Chicago market is the continued selling of long positions, causing the market to weaken again. Visible supplies this week are estimated to decrease by 3,072,000 bushels.</p>

<p>Rice Market Stabilizes After Initial Weakness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign long-grain rice was weak in the morning, continuing the weakness of recent days. Buyers tried to suppress prices, but sellers were unwilling to sell cheaply due to cost considerations, and speculators were also steadfast. As a result, fewer than 2,000 bags of long-grain rice were transacted, with market conditions similar to the previous day. Foreign rice continued to weaken by several cents in the morning. In the afternoon, foreign production prices rose, and speculators insisted on not selling, causing the market to stabilize. Local merchants believed that prices could not be further suppressed and began to inquire. As a result, the overall market offered 4,600 to 4,700 bags of Saigon rice. However, after speculators insisted on not selling forward foreign rice, foreign merchants dumped it again. The overall market saw Heyi and others sell 2,000 tons of Saigon rice for January to March, with the price not announced but said to be slightly lower than the previous market.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various groups was scarce due to wind conditions, with only about 20 boats arriving. However, inventories in the Pudong area have accumulated due to sluggish sales in recent days, and the market situation is further depressed by the change in weather, leading to a discouraged sentiment that is difficult to revive. Sales in the local market remained sluggish, relying only on the Qingdao group to purchase 1,200 to 1,300 bags. Late rice prices increased slightly by several cents to about 1 dime, but the prices of various thick japonica rice varieties fell by about 1 dime or so. However, looking at the trend of the future market, there is no hope of a turnaround in this unfavorable environment. Social Yangjian and Yinyuan, and other varieties are also facing declining prices due to the poor japonica rice market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) About 50 boats arrived in the past two days. Today, the weather is clear, and the white japonica rice market is stagnant, with only medium-grade and lower-grade rice being traded. Yinyuan thin rice is still selling well, while other varieties are average. The white japonica market is showing a downward trend, with early rice prices down by 1 to 2 dimes. Thin rice, Yang Du Bu Kejian, and other varieties are stable, while Yinyuan high grade is stable, and medium-grade and lower-grade rice are down several cents.</p>

<p>There has been no significant new progress in the sesame market recently. Foreign firms are showing weak trading interest, with only brokers covering short positions. As a result, the market is quiet. Yesterday, Sassoon Foreign Firm needed 400 tons of immediate delivery cargo, and the market opened at 9.80 yuan. The situation remained mediocre. Spot transactions were limited to inquiries from the Dongyang group, and the market remained normal. Yesterday, 500 bags of Haozhou sesame were offered at prices of 7.35 and 7.20 yuan. 300 bags of Shashi sesame were priced at 7.49 yuan, and 230 bags of Guide sesame were priced at 7.20 yuan. Soybean sales are gradually declining, and the market is quite flat and sluggish.</p>

<p>Another 2,000 Bags of Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Arrive</p>
<p>Sluggish Sales Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend stabilized, mainly because sales slightly decreased. The guild's clearing price for Grade 24 coarse white sugar was 18.90 yuan for spot goods and 19 yuan for warehouse goods, with few transactions. Transshipment goods and Dutch red sugar were not traded. Taikoo sugar and local refined white sugar prices remained unchanged. The market saw the Chaozhou group offer 100 bags of original Binhuaqing at a price of 14 yuan and Chaoqing (various grades) offered 100+ bags at prices of 11 to 10.20 yuan, with no fluctuations. It is said that Beihai Pianqing was offered at 10.5 yuan, but the trading firm did not make a counteroffer due to the high price. The first batch of domestically produced Guangdong coarse white sugar, amounting to 800 bags, has arrived, and another 2,000 bags in the recent second batch have also arrived. It is expected that trading can commence within a day.</p>

<p>Previously, due to sluggish sales of Jinshan round twigs, most of the goods from provincial groups had been released. As a result, ordinary goods had fallen to around 28 yuan. However, Hong Kong firms, considering the offered price to be too low, refused to sell except for a small amount of trading. Since entering the present period, sales from Jiangxi, Hunan, and Jin</p>
<p>Lanxi and other groups have been very active, and prices have turned around. In addition, trading firms with low inventories are also engaging in purchases. As a result, the market price has gradually rebounded by 2-3 yuan. According to industry insiders, it is predicted that the first market after the year-end closing will see high-grade round twigs priced above 40 yuan, as the total inventory in the Shanghai market is only about 20,000 boxes, and half of it is still being held by firms.</p>

<p>There have been many recent arrivals of Society Iron, so there is an exceptionally large amount circulating on the market. However, the standard grade is experiencing sluggish sales due to the abundant supply, resulting in very low offered prices. It is estimated to be 28.25 yuan per box, a decrease of 0.25 yuan compared to the previous price. It is said that the arrival of inferior goods is excessive, and the future market行情 may still face further declines.</p>

<h3 id="e286">The Demise of the Mountain Man Literature in Late Ming Dynasty <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Zai Qing</p>
<p>The flourishing of mountain men and celebrities mostly happens during times of societal decline. During these times, a segment of the intellectual class feels distressed about the current situation, but they don’t have the courage to be moths drawn to a flame, and they don’t want to bear the title of (coward) on the surface. So, becoming mountain men and celebrities becomes the way out for these people. The idea is that the uninhibited and highly recluse mountain men and celebrities are naturally meant to be (masters of mountains and waters), and they don't care about the (human world). Due to the influence of the declining era and the helpless mood of the surviving subjects, this trend will continue to exist in the early stages of each dynasty. Zheng Banqiao's family letters say (the streets are full of celebrities), which is obviously the result of this.</p>
<p>The reason why mountain men and celebrities were as numerous as (mosquitoes) in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties lies here. Mr. Tang Si once quoted Jiang Qiaosheng's poem scolding Chen Meigong, saying that Meigong (decorated the mountains and forests with a grand facade, and was a minor literary figure who flattered elegance. He had no intention of taking shortcuts to Zhongnan Mountain, but he exaggerated the false reputation of a recluse, and filled his works with borrowed knowledge, while his pursuits were to amass wealth and enjoy sensual pleasures. He was like a crane flying between the clouds, flying to and from the prime minister's office.) This poem is indeed a very harsh exposure of the true ugly state of mountain men and celebrities. Zhang Zongzi also mentioned Chen Meigong in his (self-written epitaph). When Zongzi was sixteen years old, his grandfather took him to Wulin to play, and he met Meigong. Meigong was a tourist in Qiantang at this time. He gave Zongzi a (couplet) to answer, saying (Taibai rides a whale, fishing for the night moon by the Caishi River). Zongzi immediately responded with the scene: (Meigong rides a deer, begging for favors in Qiantang County.) Meigong couldn't express his bitterness, so he had to praise him a lot. Therefore, in (inopportune) times, on one hand, there is the prosperity of mountain men and celebrities, and on the other hand, there is the intensification of opposition to mountain men and celebrities. Taking the late Ming Dynasty as an example, Chen Meigong suffered like this, and others were attacked in the same way. Wang Baigu was the authority of famous mountain men and celebrities in the Southeast, and Zhang Fengyi was the first to write (Song of the Mountain Man) to scold him. This song initially directly named Baigu, but after opposition from friends, it was changed to Shen Jiazhe, and as a result of further opposition, the name of the mountain man was not mentioned at all. Not long after, I saw a notebook with a poem satirizing Baigu, using the bayberry fruit to describe the skin disease on his body. Yuan Shigong's decadent stage in the capital, from his words (others laugh at me for being confused), can also be seen the attitude of the opponents at that time. Although Jiang Jinzhi has a (hypothetical statement that the speaker speaks for himself, and the person concerned does what he should do, so how can idle talk lead to the downfall of the country. But Jin people's talk should take transcendence and purity as its purpose, saying that it can ruin the country is wrong, saying that it cannot save the customs of the country, even if Wang Yifu and other gentlemen are resurrected, they cannot explain it. Therefore, what is valued in talk is its ability to save customs) this more progressive and compromising explanation, it could not stop the anti-mountain man and celebrity movement at that time.</p>
<p>Xue Gang has a (Letter of Resignation to Friends Claiming to be Mountain Men) which exposes the ugly state of mountain men to a great extent. He said, (The title of mountain man is not found in ancient times, but there were such people; it is prevalent today, but there is little reality; people with aspirations are ashamed of this name.) He lists ten ugly states of mountain men: (First, their bodies are not clothed in formal attire, their homes are humble and crude, they find it difficult to get close to prominent figures, so they steal beautiful names, thinking of mingling with officials and scholars, in order to gain favor. Second, after stealing a beautiful name, they immediately forget their true nature. Even if they have not mastered the rules of writing, they also discuss poetry and literature. If you ask them about their learning, they are at a loss for words. Third, they have a meager talent, and they mingle with honored guests. At moonlit feasts and flower banquets, they advance and retreat together, bowing and yielding and acting pretentiously, without any doubt. Fourth, as soon as they hear of a hospitable person, they try every means to make friends. They regard prominent people as rare commodities. As soon as they have the chance to socialize, they slander their introducers. Fifth, they observe their joy and anger, and cater to them in every possible way. They get their intentions and follow them closely, trying to win praise. Sixth, they meet by chance and immediately visit their homes. They carry name cards and deliver them everywhere, feeling that the day is not enough. They are respectful and humble, and follow others' lead from the beginning. Seventh, regardless of age, they always sign their name cards as younger, and regardless of the depth of their relationship, they all claim to be close friends. They are complacent when they boast to others about how widespread their connections are. Eighth, after claiming to be mountain men, they have no rustic charm at all. They wear light clothes and ride fat horses, live in spacious houses and eat luxurious food, and gallop through the capital to show off their success. Ninth, they greedily seek favor and their tongues can lick. If they slightly offend my feelings, they often scold people at the table. They ask the prominent person to exempt them from seeing guests at their gate. Tenth, and the worst of all, they have close and secretive friendships, and secretly pry into hidden details. Their minds are full of schemes, which are impossible to fathom. They hold people's shortcomings and use them to make themselves feel better.) Finally, he also said, (The shame is greatest for a mountain man), and changed (mountain man) to (mountain mix). There is probably no more ugly and blatant exposure of (mountain men) than this.</p>
<p>Zheng Chaozong once commented on this letter, saying: (Every time I travel in the mountains, I don't meet a single one. They walk arm in arm on thoroughfares and in mansions. I secretly wonder where the two words "mountain man" are attached. This article is enough to speak out for the mountains). The first four words can be described as extremely humorous. Not only that, Zhu Quanzai also once (spoke of celebrities). However, in his view, he was not fundamentally opposed to (celebrities), but rather opposed to (fake celebrities.) As for (fake celebrities), he quoted Wang Xiaobo's words, (A celebrity does not necessarily need to be a genius, but if he can often drink wine without doing anything and read the "Li Sao" thoroughly, he can be called a celebrity), as an explanation. He also quoted Wang Taiwei's dialogue with Meizi, (Wang Taiwei asked Meizi, "Your uncle is a celebrity, why don't you recommend him?" Meizi said, ("What is a celebrity? He utters nonsense all day long.") and added a footnote: (In order to socialize, a celebrity must utter nonsense all day long, so how can one say that uttering nonsense all day long is not a celebrity?) That is the true color of a celebrity. Li Zhuowu was also a person who opposed mountain men and celebrities, and his attitude was even more intense. In a letter to Jiao Ruohou, he wrote: (From this point of view, today's so-called sages are the same as today's so-called mountain men, but they differ in luck. If they are lucky enough to be able to write poetry, they call themselves mountain men; if they are unlucky and cannot write poetry, they reject the title of mountain man and use the name of sage. If they are lucky enough to be able to speak of innate knowledge, they call themselves sages; if they are unlucky and cannot speak of innate knowledge, they reject the title of sage and call themselves mountain men. They turn around and deceive the world to gain profit, called mountain men, but their hearts are the same as merchants, talking about morality, but their ambitions are to steal and cheat.) (Stripping off ten layers of the face) (Wei Yong's commentary on Xue Gang's words) is the most appropriate footnote to this article. Zhuowu's entire life existed in struggle. His book (Burning Book) is simply a history of ideological struggle, which is fully expressed in this short chapter of opposing mountain men and celebrities.</p>
<p>At that time, there were certainly more documents against mountain men and celebrities than just these. But just looking at these, we can also know that when mountain men and celebrities were most active, the front line against mountain men and celebrities was also developing. This anti-celebrity movement continued for a long time. In Banqiao's family letters, you can see chapters scolding mountain men and celebrities in the collection of letters from the early Qing Dynasty as well. Although some of these people who opposed mountain men and celebrities themselves failed to completely get rid of the habits of mountain men and celebrities and change, their dissatisfaction and hatred are very clear. Although the times are different now, new mountain men flourish due to objective circumstances, and new celebrities wave their banners, which is clearly visible to everyone. Some are even like (my family's doctor), not satisfied with calling themselves that, but also bring out (historical evidence), claiming that (it has existed since ancient times), but what (has existed since ancient times) is not only the camp of mountain men and celebrities, but also the group that opposes mountain men and celebrities. The ancients can be talked about, and ancient texts can also be talked about, but the question is whether it should be objective. Using dead people as your own shield is something that even the gentlemen of the late Ming Dynasty would know is wrong if they were alive today.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Guest: According to what you said, the use of vague and general words is still the fault of the old literati, and modern youth cannot be blamed. Now (don't talk about success, don't blame the past), all the past is like yesterday's death, from now on, to make the language level of modern youth particularly improved, is there any positive proposal?</p>
<p>Host: Yes, yes, yes! When Zhang Shizhao was running the Jiayin Magazine and advocating logical literature, he had a very good proposal. He said: (Do not write in the article if the form is not satisfactory; do not put the word in the sentence if its use is not clear; strive to avoid vagueness, and be incisive. Clearly see the artistic conception in the writing, and distinguish between right and wrong; like watching fish swimming in a stream, you can see the bottom clearly; like examining a spider on the spiderweb, the silk is clearly divided; this is almost it. I have the ambition to do this, but I dare not say I have achieved it! However, there are words that cannot be left out in the article, and the determination of meaning and the use of words must follow the laws set down in the mind, and should not be easily slipped over; if suddenly questioned, it is very rare that the meaning is there but the reason cannot be spoken.) (On Literature) Later, Hu Shi advocated the literary revolution, and also said: (Today's scholars, if they remember a few literary clichés in their minds, they call themselves poets. Their poems and essays are full of clichés and worn-out tunes. The bad result is that many poems and essays that are seemingly right but actually wrong, seemingly similar but actually not, are produced in the country... What I mean by going to clichés and worn-out tunes is that everyone should use their own eyes and ears to describe and depict the things they have seen and experienced in person; only seek to not lose the truth, only seek to be able to achieve the purpose of expressing things and writing intentions, that is the effort.) (Preliminary Proposals for Literary Improvement) We must open up a living path for modern youth, (everything in the future is like being born today), only by completely separating youth from the old literati, and not letting youth be infected with those old germs. On the one hand, we should do basic work in terms of rhetoric and sentence-making: compile some simple and accurate dictionaries for young people, (not as messy as the Ciyuan) so that young people can easily look them up, sort out perfect grammar and rhetoric books for young people, so that young people have rules to follow; make a perfect word differentiation book for young people, (word differentiation is definitely not word differentiation) put the same types of words together so that they can be used flexibly, annotate words that look similar so that they can dispel doubts; select a living anthology for young people, (not dead articles like Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi) so that they can have good role models. If people who care about language work hard to do this, in ten or twenty years, the results will be visible!</p>
<p>Guest: Are there people doing this part of the positive work?</p>
<p>Host: Who are we waiting for to do it? You and I are both Chinese teachers above the intermediate level, shouldn't we work harder? (End)</p>
<h3 id="e288">About (Autobiography) <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>I have always loved to read autobiographies or books of the autobiographical type. I have read Rousseau's Confessions, Lenin's biography, Mussolini's and Hitler's autobiographies, as well as Hu Shi's Forty Years of Self-Narrative, Shen Congwen's, and Record of Ding Ling. Reading other people's autobiographies allows you to understand their lives, personalities, hobbies, and worldviews in great detail. Therefore, I really like reading this kind of book. A good autobiography is one that can truthfully write out the experiences of one's past life without any concealment, such as Rousseau's Confessions. However, some people are not like that. They want to show off by writing an autobiography, writing themselves as a genius, a very capable person. They hide all the shameful experiences and foolish behaviors. I have seen some people's autobiographies in a certain magazine before, and they really gave me a headache!</p>
<p>Recently, I borrowed a copy of Duncan's autobiography from a friend, and I felt very satisfied after reading it. This is also a good book. She doesn't brag or hide her shortcomings, but writes boldly. There are many parts that are really touching, making people shed tears of sympathy. She writes about the pain of struggling on the line of starvation when she and her mother flowed from the countryside to the city, and the lack of travel expenses when she took a cattle boat from New York to London, being rejected by the hotel owner and spending three days and three nights on the street, and then using deception to stay in a very luxurious hotel. These emotional descriptions are extremely moving, so I say this is a good book.</p>
<p>I advocate that everyone can write an autobiography. Autobiographies don't necessarily have to be written well by celebrities, scholars, or artists. In fact, if they can write truthfully and boldly, a rickshaw puller, a beggar, an actor, a prostitute, a smoker, or a street singer might write even more moving stories. It's just a pity that they don't have the skills to use words and cannot write it out, so all the touching stories and depraved stories are buried in their own hearts. For example, my father, he was a farmer and a small businessman. He lost his grandfather when he was seven or eight years old, and lived and grew up in various forms of bullying and pain until he was able to be a peddler himself. He didn't know how much wind and frost he had endured and how much hunger he had suffered. He told me that for a long period of time, he and his grandmother ate vegetable leaves, sweet potatoes, and tears every day. In this situation, there was absolutely no opportunity for education. In his middle age, he also served as a brave soldier on the front line in a clan fight, holding a fire cannon, killing people, and seeing dozens of heads hung high on tree trunks. Under the tree trunks, a group of people gathered, drinking, singing, and gloriously looking at those spoils of war! In his own village, he watched people's eyes being gouged out, ears being cut off... He had seen too much of the inhuman acts of strong families bullying weak families, and he felt it was too common. I believe that if my father could write an autobiography, it would definitely be very moving. It's a pity that he can't write it either. Maybe one day I'll write it for him, but of course, other people's feelings can't compare to his own.</p>
<p>Also, I have a girlfriend who is often in love affairs. In five years, she has loved more than a dozen people, including university professors, college students, writers, and officials... These kinds of people, however, the small storms in the river of love cannot discourage her. To this day, she still has that courage, and she is still as young and beautiful as ever. She has used coats that cost three or four hundred yuan, silk stockings that cost twenty yuan a pair, and gloves that cost twenty-eight yuan a pair, but when storms occurred in the river of love, she only ate fried dough sticks and flatbread for a living, wore outdated clothes, and even borrowed ten or twenty cents from people. I believe that if she wrote an autobiography, it would also be very impressive. So I think that writing an autobiography doesn't necessarily have to be done by celebrities, scholars, or artists. Anyone can write it, as long as his or her life is unique, twisted, and extraordinary, it is enough to write an autobiography.</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>(Friend, why can't we get there no matter how far we walk, what's going on? Moreover, we're always walking on dark roads, where are you trying to lead me)?</p>
<p>I couldn't bear it any longer, and I finally said it out, questioning my friend who was walking with me: My friend, you originally said you were going to lead me to open up the social customs, but in Harbin, does opening up the social customs really mean going to dark places? What kind of social customs are we trying to open up?</p>
<p>He was a graduate of a Shanghai sports school, and had been an elementary school physical education teacher in Harbin for six years. Our separation was also exactly six years. I was really surprised to be able to meet him in Harbin this time. For six years, due to the interruption of communication, my memory had long forgotten my friend's figure and face. The two of us met in Daoli Garden. He was wearing a black suit that was quite unsuitable for summer. Not to mention that there were quite a few wrinkles on the suit, which didn't look very good, but it was also stained with some oil stains. He was holding a thin stick that was peeling paint and black all over in his right hand, and wearing a faded straw hat on his head. He was standing in front of the park cinema, staring intently at the advertisement for the Burning of the Red Lotus Temple. I first saw his back, but it immediately made me think of Cao Baohua, who was known among his fellow villagers for being unkempt six years ago. Sure enough, my guess was correct. When I walked up to him and recognized him, he also recognized me at the same time. He opened his mouth before me and said:</p>
<p>(Haven't left yet? Are we in the human world? Is it really you who came back? Sigh!...)</p>
<p>He sighed and couldn't continue speaking, but I could tell that his words were full of infinite sadness and emotion. I guessed that he thought it was a mistake for me to come back this time.</p>
<p>I didn't answer his words immediately, but pulled him to the ice cream parlor next door, sat down, and then talked to him about our lives in the past six years.</p>
<p>After that, we came and went very often, spending at least two or three hours together every day.</p>
<p>One night, I went to his house again. As soon as I entered the door, he said impatiently:</p>
<p>(Wei Hang, tonight I'll take you to open up the social customs.)</p>
<p>I was very happy about this, so I asked excitedly:</p>
<p>(That's great, but where are we going)?</p>
<p>(You don't need to ask, you'll know when we get there.)</p>
<p>But his words couldn't satisfy me. I still asked:</p>
<p>(Are we going to a brothel)?</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>(Then, are we going to a small restaurant with female waitresses)?</p>
<p>From my friend's second shake of his head, it proved that I was wrong again. I pretended to be angry and said loudly:</p>
<p>(I guess there's probably no roulette in Harbin, or maybe it's an opium den)!</p>
<p>(Don't ask, you'll know in a while.)</p>
<p>After a while, I walked with him on the road, following him to find a place to open up the social customs.</p>

<h3 id="e291">Understanding Telegraphs <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Lv Bing</p>
<p>If you want to make use of things, you must first have a full understanding of them. A full understanding, in layman's terms, means knowing the threshold. If you don't understand the threshold well, you will only have a superficial understanding, so how can you make full use of it?</p>
<p>Using the telegraph to obtain the speed of communication between the two parties is well known to ordinary people. But how fast is the telegraph exactly? And how to write and send it? How can the telegraph's efficiency be fully realized, and how can the sender reduce its expenses? This is of great value for those who use the telegraph to study. Therefore, simply knowing the convenience of the telegraph does not necessarily mean that you really understand the telegraph. You must understand the threshold of sending telegraphs before you can.</p>
<p>In the past, people in society often did not study how to send telegrams economically and cost-effectively. They were also mostly unaware of the transmission routes of the bureaus and stations. However, in recent years, the situation has changed greatly. Those who send telegrams have made a lot of progress in understanding the threshold. They know exactly how long it will take for a telegram sent to a certain place to arrive, and how long it will take to get a reply. Occasionally, if there is a line blockage or congestion, which causes a slight delay, they often call to ask for the number. Therefore, the handling of telegraph business in today's bureaus and stations is very different from the past. This is because the reporter lives in Tianjin and the business personnel told me about it, which is indeed a matter of experience.</p>
<p>In fact, this phenomenon shows the progress of society's understanding of the telegraph, and it is also what the bureau and station personnel expect. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has spared no effort in improving business, such as increasing the transmission speed and verifying the accuracy of telegrams. Since the implementation, the results have been remarkable. The purpose is nothing more than to make everyone know that the telegraph is indeed fast and accurate, in order to obtain the development of business and seek the convenience of social communication. If the people of the country cannot fully understand the telegraph, there will be many obstacles in the future of the business. Now that the threshold is well understood, and the public also knows the situation of the bureaus and stations handling business, in the future, the use of telegraphs will become more and more popular. The progress of all businesses often depends on the spur of all parties, and the telegraph is no exception.</p>
<h3 id="e292">Talking to Various Shipping Companies about the Unpaid Telegraph Fees for Ships <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Fen</p>
<p>Ship telegraphs are divided into two categories: incoming and outgoing. Some are transmitted through domestic coastal radio stations, and some are transmitted through foreign coastal radio stations. Incoming telegrams are sent by ships to coastal radio stations for delivery, or sent by ships to coastal radio stations for forwarding to various local bureaus for delivery. Outgoing telegrams are sent directly by coastal radio stations to ships, or sent by local bureaus to coastal radio stations for forwarding to ships. When sending telegrams to ships, the coastal radio stations or local bureaus can collect all the fees that should be paid at the time. Telegrams sent by ships to land cannot be paid at the time because they are being sent while sailing at sea. They can only be temporarily recorded and settled later by the relevant telecommunications authorities with the company to which the ship belongs. The accounts for telegrams sent through domestic coastal radio stations are settled by the Ministry of Communications every quarter (three months). The Ministry of Communications sends a statement of incoming and outgoing telegrams to each shipping company for verification and payment. Those transmitted through foreign coastal radio stations are sent by the telecommunications authorities of the countries concerned to the Ministry of Communications for collection from the shipping companies. According to the International Radio Telegraph Regulations, shipping companies must pay the fees within six weeks of receiving the statement. If there are any discrepancies, they must request correction within six months of receiving the statement, otherwise it will be considered as an acknowledgment. If the fees are not paid after six months, interest will be charged at 6% per annum. Therefore, when foreign telegraph bureaus or foreign ships send telegrams through our country's coastal radio stations and owe fees to the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Communications receives the money on time when it collects the money from the telecommunications authorities of various countries every quarter. This shows that the governments and merchants of various countries attach great importance to credit and obey international regulations. The speed of their handling is just a matter of course. However, this is not the case in our country. It is said that when our country's shipping companies receive the wireless telegraph statements issued by the Ministry of Communications, most of them pay the fees according to regulations, but there are also many who owe part or all of the fees. Some of them have been in arrears for several years, and the amount of arrears ranges from several hundred to several thousand yuan. Although the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly urged them to pay, they have not paid. This account includes those entrusted by foreign telecommunications authorities to the Ministry of Communications for collection. These authorities do not understand the reason why Chinese shipping companies do not pay, and have repeatedly urged the Ministry of Communications to pay in strict terms. The Ministry of Communications is in a difficult position to answer. This kind of arrears is not a small matter in terms of international credit, so I will explain it in detail as follows:</p>
<p>(1) As mentioned above, it is necessary to temporarily record the telegrams sent by ships due to the circumstances. However, some of the telegrams sent by ships are sent by the ships themselves, and some are sent by passengers. The fees for those sent by passengers have already been collected by the ships. The shipping companies only need to deduct the ship fees that they should get, and the remaining fees are all collected on behalf of the passengers. The companies must pay the fees according to regulations. At present, the shipping companies not only fail to pay the fees that they owe themselves, but also drag on the fees collected on behalf of the passengers. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has great difficulties in accounting.</p>
<p>(2) When the Ministry of Communications collects fees from shipping companies, the companies often fail to pay on time. The reasons they give are either that the business is not prosperous and the economy is difficult, or that the accounts do not match and need to be checked. If the company's business is not prosperous, it is an internal problem, so let's put it aside for the time being. As for the mismatch of accounts, the company can order the ships under its jurisdiction to check the telegram copies in detail, or directly request a review from the Ministry of Communications. Moreover, each quarterly account is only ten to several hundred yuan. If it can be paid quarterly, the burden is not too heavy. In addition, there are still the fees collected on behalf of passengers in a quarterly account. The fees that the company itself should pay are only a small part of it, which is even smaller. However, the company repeatedly delays payment, day after day, so the arrears become more and more, and it is impossible to pay them. It is not a good idea for the company.</p>
<p>(3) The persons in charge of the company, such as directors and managers, are all important figures in society. They are afraid that they will not have time to maintain their credit, so there is no reason to intentionally delay payment. Perhaps some employees in the company (such as accountants or bookkeepers) think that this kind of account is no different from the accounts of ordinary merchants, and they can owe it if they want to. They don't know that part of this account is the fees owed to foreign telecommunications authorities. These authorities have already deducted it from the accounts between them and the Ministry of Communications. If the company owes it for a long time, the Ministry of Communications will not be able to make up for it. The company's responsible authorities should inform the internal employees in detail so that these arrears can be settled as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is said that the Ministry of Communications believes that this kind of account cannot be suspended for a long time for the sake of international credit, and will formulate measures to severely crack down on it. The company's authorities are all enlightened people and will surely be able to appreciate the government's difficulties and pay off the debt as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e293">International Radio Station Over the Past Year (Continued) <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Chenghu</p>
<p>(B) Business Development</p>
<p>The expansion of the international radio station's facilities is as described above. Business operations should also follow suit, so that all equipment can be fully utilized and business can prosper. Here are the new business items undertaken by the station in the past year:</p>
<p>Opening of New Lines 丨 Before the 23rd year, the international radio station successively opened communication lines to Hong Kong, Manila, Java, Saigon, San Francisco, Berlin, Paris, Geneva, and Moscow. However, due to equipment limitations, it was inconvenient to add more. In February of the 23rd year, the Marconi machine was installed, and a direct line to London was opened. Thus, this central metropolis of world politics and economy also became a place closely connected with the international station day and night. Later, the Ministry of Communications, considering the large number of Japanese expatriates in China and the frequent telegraphic communications, which relied on submarine cables and resulted in the loss of rights, deeply regretted this. It negotiated with the Japanese government and opened a line to Tokyo on June 1st. By then, famous cities and towns in the East and West could communicate through the international radio station in an instant.</p>
<p>Dedicated Line for Receiving and Sending Telegrams 丨 For the convenience of large banks and businesses in Shanghai with a high volume of telegrams, the international radio station rented dedicated lines from the Shanghai Telephone Company, directly connecting these businesses to the station's telegraph room. Telephones or teletype machines were installed at both ends for exchanging telegrams. This service also began on a trial basis in the 23rd year. As more and more businesses in the finance and stock industries began to use it, the station set up a dedicated line exchange and assigned dedicated personnel to manage it day and night to facilitate operations. If businesses wished to send personnel to the station to receive and send telegrams, they could rent soundproof rooms from the station. The structure of these rooms allowed for sound isolation, and a dedicated telephone line connected directly to the business. When personnel stationed at the station contacted their companies by telephone, there was no risk of revealing commercial secrets.</p>
<p>Increasing Telegram Delivery Efficiency 丨 For telegrams arriving from various locations, except for those using dedicated lines, the international station delivered them to the recipients by messengers riding bicycles. To improve delivery efficiency, more than 20 new messengers were hired successively last year to ensure telegrams were delivered as soon as they arrived. Each messenger was required to deliver only one telegram per trip to avoid delays. Shanghai was divided into several zones, with specified delivery times for each zone. Messengers were strictly required to deliver within the time limit, with penalties for delays and rewards for timely delivery. Those who could find ways to deliver telegrams to unclear addresses were also rewarded. Therefore, all messengers strived to deliver quickly.</p>
<p>Reducing Telegram Copying Errors 丨 While speed is essential for telegrams, accuracy is even more important. Moreover, the international radio station handles a lot of commercial intelligence in its transmitted and received telegrams, and a single error can lead to significant liabilities. To enhance the station's reputation, every effort was made to avoid errors. In October of the 23rd year, the Ministry of Communications approved the recruitment of 30 telegram clerks to be trained as full-time proofreaders. All incoming and outgoing telegrams were proofread immediately after receipt or dispatch. If any errors were found, the parties concerned would be notified immediately for correction without waiting for inquiries, to ensure the public's absolute trust in the reliability of the international radio station.</p>
<p>Business Inspection 丨 The Ministry of Communications strives to satisfy users of telegram services. Therefore, it seeks detailed information through surveys and inquiries. It ordered all bureaus and stations across the country to establish business inspectors to specifically inquire about users' opinions on the bureaus and stations. Special attention was paid to international telegrams handled by the international radio station. Any deficiencies in operations and areas needing improvement or reform could be reported to the inspectors. The station would humbly adopt and strive to improve these suggestions.</p>
<p>Distribution of Booklets 丨 Since the 23rd year, the international radio station has been publishing a booklet issued monthly, in both Chinese and English, containing information about the international radio station and basic knowledge of international telegrams for users' reference. The booklet is mailed to major businesses in Shanghai and other cities on a regular basis. If any are missed, they can be requested from the station, and will be sent immediately free of charge.</p>
<p>Creation of Delayed News Telegrams 丨 According to the regulations attached to the International Telegraph Convention, news telegrams should be dispatched earlier than ordinary telegrams, while delayed telegrams are the opposite. However, the charge for news telegrams is only 20% to 25% of the ordinary rate, as news telegrams often contain many words and are given special treatment to facilitate the news industry. However, sometimes the news is not very important, and transmission can be slightly delayed. If charged at the news telegram rate, it would still be too expensive, or even prohibitive. To promote international news, the Ministry of Communications created a type of delayed news telegram with a lower rate than news telegrams, and the dispatch procedure is after ordinary telegrams but before delayed telegrams. Currently, agreements have been reached only with the United States and Canada, and it was implemented in May of last year. Negotiations are still ongoing with other countries.</p>
<p>The above points are the major new facilities in business over the past year. Other minor matters, such as expanding the locations reachable by the Japan line, handling the receipt and dispatch of telegrams by city telephones, establishing business inquiry offices, and organizing registration, are not detailed. More important matters that are still in progress are as follows:</p>
<p>Wireless Telephone Communication 丨 The Ministry of Communications plans to add wireless telephone equipment to the international radio station, as mentioned earlier. In the spring and summer of last year, the station used the Marconi machine's broadcast equipment to conduct preliminary telephone experiments. The locations tested included London, Berlin, San Francisco, Geneva, and Manila. Liu Chongjie, the Chinese ambassador to Germany, Hu Shize, the ambassador to Switzerland, Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham, the American consul-general in Shanghai, and prominent Shanghai figures such as Liu Hongsheng and Huang Jiangquan, participated in the conversations and concluded that it was possible to open commercial services. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications is currently negotiating communication methods with various countries.</p>
<p>China-Italy Communication 丨 Rome, the capital of Italy, is one of the political centers of Europe and has repeatedly requested communication with China last year. Joint experiments were conducted, but initially, the Italian side's transmission was weak and not smooth. After repeated improvements, it has become perfect. Once the contract is signed, official communication can begin.</p>
<p>Special Personnel to Pick Up Telegrams 丨 Since the Ministry of Communications implemented postal and telecommunications cooperation, post offices in Shanghai have been collecting international wireless telegrams on behalf of the station. Senders can submit telegrams at their nearest post office, saving the trouble of long journeys. However, Shanghai's urban area is vast, and sometimes it is still inconvenient. Therefore, people use telephones to notify the international radio station to send personnel to pick up telegrams. This was previously done by messengers, but messengers could not calculate fees or collect money, so it was limited to account-holding businesses. To make it more accessible, it is planned to assign several special personnel to handle it. The international radio station will purchase several motorized vehicles. Upon receiving a telephone call, they will immediately drive to pick up the telegram and return to the station to dispatch it, similar to telephone shopping in stores. Customers can communicate with foreign countries at any time without leaving their homes.</p>
<p>(C) Statistical Summary</p>
<p>The international radio station has made progress in both construction and business over the past year, sparing no effort. Readers are eager to know the effects of this. Here is a summary of statistics to show a glimpse of the results.</p>
<p>Business Status 丨 The international radio station transmitted and received 50,000 telegrams per month last year, totaling 700,000 words, which is a significant increase compared to previous years. Revenue has also increased accordingly. Here is a simple chart showing the total number of words, telegrams, and revenue in silver dollars over the years, to show the growth.</p>
<p>Telegram Transmission Speed 丨 For international telegrams, except for those using dedicated lines, ordinary senders bring their telegrams to the general receiving and dispatching office of the international radio station in the Sassoon House on Renji Road, where a telegram clerk calculates the number of words and the fee, prints the dispatch time, and sends the telegram to the telegraph room via pneumatic tube. The registering clerk logs the number, indicates the route, and passes it to the dispatch operator for transmission. This process takes about 45 seconds. The automatic high-speed machine is used for transmission, and the speed can reach 300 to 400 words per minute. However, due to differences in equipment and methods at the receiving stations, the transmission speed varies from location to location, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>Location　　Words sent and received per minute (Average 5 letters per word)　Location　　Words sent and received per minute (Average 5 letters per word)</p>
<p>San Francisco　160　　　　　　　　　　London　　350</p>
<p>Berlin　　300　　　　　　　　　　Paris　200</p>
<p>Geneva　150　　　　　　　　　　Tokyo　　150</p>
<p>Moscow　80　　　　　　　　　　　Manila　150</p>
<p>Batavia　120　　　　　　　　　　Hong Kong　　100</p>
<p>Saigon　80</p>
<p>The handling procedure for telegrams from abroad is the opposite of the above. Incoming telegrams are recorded by an automatic waveform machine, and the speed is about the same as shown in the previous table. After the receiving operator copies it using a typewriter, it is sent to the registering clerk via a belt conveyor for registration, and then it is assigned to the dispatcher, who prepares an envelope. Then, it is sent to the dispatch room via a pneumatic tube, and the messenger immediately sets off by bicycle. This process takes about one minute and twenty seconds. The delivery time for the messenger depends on the distance, and there are specified time limits for all locations in Shanghai. Messengers are not allowed to linger on the way. The time limit table is lengthy and not recorded.</p>
<p>Error Records 丨 The number of errors increases and decreases depending on the tightness of management and fluctuates with business conditions. Although the actual number of errors last year was higher than the previous year, it decreased compared to previous years when calculated as a percentage of the total number of words sent and received, as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Year　　　　　　　Number of Errors　　　　Percentage of Errors in Total Words</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 20　　　　523　　　　　0.018%</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 21　　　　789　　　　　0.022%</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 22　　　　985　　　　　0.024%</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 23　　　　1428　　　　0.020%</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Statistics</p>
<p>丨 The assets, personnel, etc. of the international radio station, based on the survey at the end of June last year, are listed below:</p>
<p>Total Assets　　　　　　　1,948,548.79 yuan</p>
<p>Land Area　　　　　　　491.5735 mu</p>
<p>Building Area　　　　　461.92 square zhang</p>
<p>Number of Employees (June)　　385 people</p>
<p>Monthly Salaries (June)　　25,849 yuan</p>
<p>Account-Holding Telegram Businesses　　1,210 households</p>
<p>Transmitting Machines　　　　　　　9 units</p>
<p>Receiving Machines　　　　　　　19 units</p>
<p>Vacuum Tubes Used on Transmitting and Receiving Machines　749 units</p>
<p>Directional Antennas for Transmitting and Receiving　　16 sets</p>
<p>Various Generator Sets　　　　　　　33 sets</p>
<p>The international radio station has achieved these results in the four years since its establishment. This is due to the support and encouragement from the central government and the efforts of the Ministry of Communications. However, without the love of our national people for state-owned enterprises and the promotion of reclaiming rights, these achievements would not have been possible. Thinking of the difficult beginnings, and looking forward to perfecting the future, we deeply hope that the communications authorities will further expand the existing rules so that business can improve and innovate day by day. Then, the future of China's telecommunications administration will be promising. (End)</p>

<p>Still Flourishing in Snowy and Frozen Lands　Progress in Business Despite Difficult Circumstances</p>
<h3 id="e295">Free Inquiry of Telegrams <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>When this publication was founded, I wrote an article titled "(Notes on Inquiring About Telegrams)," which was published in the first few issues of this publication. Later, when the Ministry of Communications compiled and printed the booklet "(Summary of New Regulations on Saving Telegram Fees)," it also included this "(Notes on Inquiring About Telegrams)" with the aim of enabling readers to know how to inquire about telegrams and obtain full convenience. However, although 50,000 copies of this booklet were printed and distributed, it is estimated that fewer than 50,000 people actually received it, and even fewer people saw the "(Notes on Inquiring About Telegrams)" included in it! That's why I once heard someone say: "(I received a telegram one day, and there seemed to be a mistake in one of the words in the telegram. I didn't understand it, so I sent a telegram to ask my friend. Later, I received a reply telegram, and sure enough, the word was wrong. I asked the telegraph office to refund the fees for the two telegrams we sent back and forth for inquiry, but the telegraph office refused to refund them. They only refunded the fee for the wrong word, which made me extremely indignant because it was too unfair!)" When ordinary people hear this, they will definitely say that the telegraph office is wrong, but let me explain the regulations, and you will know that someone suffered a loss because he didn't understand the regulations and can't blame the telegraph office for refusing to refund the fees.</p>
<p>The telegraph office receives and sends thousands of telegrams a day, and even small offices receive dozens. Each telegram averages 20 words, so more than 100,000 words are sent and received every day, and at least a thousand words. It is inevitable to make mistakes in the hustle and bustle. It is reasonable to have one or two errors in 10,000 words. We can't say that the telegraph office staff is not doing their job. Since telegrams are inevitably prone to errors, the telegraph office has specially stipulated a remedy, that is, if the recipient of a telegram believes that there is a doubt about a word or number in the telegram, they can immediately inquire with the telegraph office. The telegraph office will immediately send an official telegram to the sending office for inquiry free of charge. After receiving the telegram, the sending office will check it against the original. If it is indeed a transmission error, it will immediately send a reply telegram to correct it (if it is not wrong, it will also send a reply notification). After receiving the reply telegram, the receiving office will immediately notify the recipient. With such an inquiry, neither the recipient nor the sender needs to spend any money, and the reply can be obtained earlier than inquiring by sending a telegram themselves. Because inquiring by sending a telegram requires the telegraph office to send the inquiry telegram to the original sender, and then wait for him to verify it before sending someone to send the reply telegram to the telegraph office for transmission. This back-and-forth trip takes at least an hour. If the telegraph office sends an official telegram to inquire, the official telegram can be checked and replied to immediately when it reaches the other telegraph office, saving the time of sending the telegram twice, and the official telegram is faster than commercial telegrams in transmission, so the reply is of course obtained faster. With these two advantages, why should we send our own telegrams to inquire?</p>
<p>After reading the above explanation, readers will know that someone suffered a loss because he didn't understand the regulations, not because the telegraph office was unreasonable! However, we can't just blame someone for not understanding the regulations, but also blame our colleagues in the telecommunications industry for lacking publicity, so even now there are several banks and companies that still don't know the method of inquiring about telegrams for free, resulting in frequent unpleasant incidents of requesting refunds. I hope that the business inspectors of major offices will pay special attention to this point, publicize and explain more to major businesses at any time, and give them the booklet on saving fees, so that they feel the thoughtfulness of the telegraph office's telegraphic service and increase their confidence in using telegrams!</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to tell readers: Inquiring about telegrams is not limited to doubts about the wording of the telegram. If there are missing words, errors in the place of origin, errors in the date of transmission, or other questions, you can always inquire by telephone or in person. The telegraph office will answer sincerely. If there is arrogance or failure to answer immediately, you can report it to the Ministry of Communications for investigation, and you will receive a satisfactory answer.</p>
<h3 id="e296">How to Utilize Telegrams <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Zhonghua</p>
<p>In the previous issues of this publication, there was an article by Mr. Qinghua called (The Small Threshold for Sending Telegrams), in which he explained in detail how to make sending telegrams profitable (cheap and good)! However, in addition to (cheap and good), it seems that we also need to study the convenience of (procurement). It turns out that there are many convenient ways to send telegrams, but our Chinese telegram-sending public has not fully utilized them, so I will talk about (how to utilize telegrams) to introduce them to readers. If you live in a place that only has a post office and no telegraph office, and you need to send a telegram to relatives and friends in a distant place, it is completely wrong if you think that you cannot send a telegram! You can use the same procedure, pay the same fees, and send a telegram at the post office. The post office will use the fastest method to send it to the nearest telegraph office for transmission. Conversely. If you want to send a telegram to a place that has no telegraph office but only a post office, the situation is the same; the telegraph office will send it to the nearest telegraph office to the destination for mailing. This method is commonly called (postal telegram).</p>
<p>Someone said: It is true that you can send postal telegrams in places with post offices but no telegraph offices, but what about places with no post offices or telegraph offices? This is easy to solve; the telegraph office will hire a temporary messenger to send it to you. The messenger's fee will be paid by the recipient or you can pay it in advance. However, add (special delivery) or an Express character before the recipient's name and address, which will be counted as one word for the fee. If you pay the express fee in advance, add an XP character before the recipient's name and address (meaning (express fee paid)), which will also be counted as one word for the fee. In telegraphic terminology, this method is called (special delivery telegram).</p>
<p>It has already been said above that there is absolutely no problem for two fixed places to send telegrams to each other. But suppose your friend is traveling in Europe and America or traveling in famous mountains and rivers in the country, and there is no fixed itinerary, you can still use (follow-up telegram) to communicate with him or her. What is called (follow-up telegram)? That is, the telegraph offices in various places automatically send it to the destination for you, that is, the telegraph office will find the recipient for you until it is found and delivered properly. You also need to add an FS character before the recipient's name and address for this type of telegram, which will be counted as one word for the fee. The sender only needs to pay the fee for a section of the itinerary in advance, and the rest will be collected from the recipient by the telegraph office.</p>
<p>There is also a type of (transferred telegram), which is similar to the above situation, that is, when the recipient cannot receive it due to other matters, a related person can request it to be transferred to a certain place without having to send another telegram. Although the fee still needs to be calculated, this allows the recipient to immediately know the ins and outs of the telegram, saving the tone of the middleman's narration, and the sender can also get a relatively quick reply.</p>

<p>Current Status of Telegrams in Turkey Turkey currently has 631 telegraph offices, with a total line length of 66,580 kilometers and a number of 14,804,516 telegrams, of which 13,987,516 are domestic telegrams, 400,000 are international outgoing telegrams, 410,000 are international incoming telegrams, and 7,000 are transit telegrams. The telegraph income is approximately 1,574,562 Turkish pounds. (One Turkish pound is approximately six US dollars.) There are a total of 5,470 employees, of which 4,780 are engaged in telegraph work.</p>
<p>Change of Name of Czech Telegraph Office According to a notice from the Enban International Telegraph Association Office: The Czech Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has formulated a list of telegraph office names in the country written in Czech. From January 1 this year, telegrams sent to the Czech Republic whose recipient place names are not sent according to the list of office names above will be returned to the sender and handled as undeliverable. This rule only applies to international telegrams, and the list of office names compiled in German or Hungarian will still be used for domestic telegrams in the country. (The Ministry of Communications has also received this notice and has informed all offices in December last year.)</p>
<p>Connection of Japan-US Wireless Telephone Overseas telephone services in the United States have connected US telephone agencies with major cities in Japan (Tokyo, West Kyoto, Yokohama, Kobe) for direct calls since December 7 last year. There are nearly one million Japanese phones, making it the 60th country within the range of the American frequency, and it will become an important country in the world communications network. The United States is actually in a central position in this communications network. Of the countries that have not communicated with the United States and have 100,000 phones, only New Zealand, Soviet Russia, and China have that distinction.</p>

<h3 id="e298">Super-Scientific Divination <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Qiongsheng</p>
<p>When the world is in chaos, Chinese fortune-tellers often use phrases like "good fortune follows bad" or "Heaven is not tired of chaos, and it is inevitable" to cater to people's desire for peace. Even scholars like to talk about "King Wen's Divine Lesson" and brag about divination with tortoise shells and yarrow stalks. The well-known Zhuge Kongming was greatly skilled in "observing celestial phenomena, understanding geography, mastering yin and yang, and understanding numerology," and was truly able to "hold the universe in his sleeves." In this way, the life, death, survival, or destruction of ordinary people all depend on fate. There is no other reason besides fate.</p>
<p>Now, the universe is shouting about economic panic and the threat of war again. Ordinary people's old wounds have not yet healed, and new wounds have reappeared. In addition to being terrified, they cannot find a way to eliminate disasters and avoid calamities on their own, so they flock to fortune-tellers again. As a result, in addition to the thriving careers of some astrologers, the (scientific spirit medium), which is popular both at home and abroad, has become popular. This is why many experts and doctors are able to practice political hypnosis. The Paris Observatory Director Maurice's statement after observing the sun and moon, that sunspots constantly emit electric and magnetic forces that can make people feel uneasy and irritable, thus hiding the great war crisis of 1936 and 1937 and causing other disasters, and citing history to prove his point, saying that the world can enjoy peace and prosperity, and mankind can devote itself to art and culture, when the sun is still, is this kind of (pure) argument.</p>
<p>Using astronomical evidence in science to explain the difficulty of mankind's enjoyment of peace and prosperity and the inevitable arrival of world war is as brilliant as the explanations of the Heavenly Lord of the Primordial Beginning in the Investiture of the Gods, who used (divine will) to explain the inevitable calamities of people, but Maurice claims that he does not believe in astrology, so we might as well call it super-scientific divination. The reason why it is super-scientific is because it has the following meanings.</p>
<p>(1) Since the electric and magnetic forces emitted by sunspots have already made humans irritable and uneasy, thereby concealing the crisis of world war, this is tantamount to saying that (science) has already determined (fate). Because although many scientists are now ascending to the stratosphere and even fantasizing about flying to other planets, they have not yet reached the point where they can eliminate sunspots, or (steal the sky and replace the sun). Knowing that the war is coming, but its coming is determined by the sun, which is beyond the power of us humans, isn't this a very modern (fate)?</p>
<p>(2) Since it is fate, it naturally means that not only is the reduction of armaments and the running around for peace by Laval and others futile, but also that any methods we think of to eliminate war and resist war are useless. In that case, let's all listen to fate and head towards war! Because trying to eliminate war and resist war is no different from violating (science).</p>
<p>(3) Nowadays, heresies are rampant, saying that war is the initiative of a few people, and most people suffer, but since it has been decided by the sun, of course these nonsense are all ghost stories. We can only (unite as one) and head towards war. Saying that it is for the benefit of a few people, and even wanting people to rise up and resist, is too unscientific!</p>
<p>Now is the world of science, science is omnipotent, and countries are sparing no effort to promote science. Being able to achieve such effectiveness is not without reason.</p>

<p>— Xi Bai</p>
<p>The feelings of the past are dead, and now only remain the bleak, howling north winds of an early winter night.</p>
<p>I dare not raise my heavy head to gaze upon the lusterless moon of the city; ah, even less do I dare to surmise the countless stars beneath the azure sky.</p>
<p>The north wind blows, the night is so cold; we seem like wild beasts, like primitive people, stark naked in the silent, frigid wilderness, circling a bonfire, laughing and dancing.</p>
<p>(Ah, dance! We care not if civilized men regard us as beasts. Come, my people, let us dance until dawn, until the morning!)</p>
<p>(But alas, my beloved, I cannot dance!)</p>
<p>(What does that matter! Let us dance like savages, heedless of rhythm!)</p>
<p>Dance, dance! How light the body feels, how synchronized the steps! Our hearts, too, resonate, beating in time.</p>
<p>(Oh, what troubles you? Are you so filled with sorrow? Are we not joyous, like the savage primitives?)</p>
<p>(Joyous! This is boundless joy! But can the bitter love of the past be forgotten? Oh, do you remember how you broke my heart? Ah, when I look at you, you seem like a demoness!)</p>
<p>(Bah, when I look at you, you seem like a gigolo! Why do you incessantly declare war on me?)</p>
<p>(You enchanting demoness are more than a match!)</p>
<p>(Alas, who causes your heart to battle in pain?)</p>
<p>(Oh, is this a victory you can boast of? My demoness!)</p>
<p>(You little gigolo, will you not yield at my feet?)</p>
<p>(I want to gouge out the bright eyes of you demoness, dimming them with darkness, devour your blood-red lips, and pluck out your heart to repay the debt of my grief! I will swallow your voluptuous body whole, so that you may no longer live among men!)</p>
<p>(Alas, are we still quarreling? If it were still as it was, I would not obey you, oh oh, please listen! Listen to me repeatedly…you are willing to have me in… , …but I am not willing for you to be lonely!</p>
<p>Look to where the light is, look!</p>
<p>Look to where the light is, look!</p>
<p>There stand two towering graves.</p>
<p>There, epitaphs have already been written for us,</p>
<p>Please look… this is me pretending… respectful appearance…</p>
<p>In the grave will be buried a demoness and a gigolo.</p>
<p>Ah! Let us sing and dance, and skip there!)</p>
<p>(Alas, I want to chew up that clever tongue of you demoness first</p>
<p>Ah, said … the old … and now … a new appearance…</p>

<h3 id="e300">The Birth of a Beautiful Little Pig <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Sakura</p>
<p>Suppose, this is a story about the birth of a beautiful little pig.</p>
<p>The father is young, and likewise, the mother is so young.</p>
<p>The young man, apart from earnestly seeking to improve, has no other extravagant desires. He diligently performs his duties, hoping to gradually rise in position and increase his salary. He is able to maintain a relatively comfortable family life! He is filial to his elders, and he cherishes his wife.</p>
<p>The wife always gives him great comfort and stimulating encouragement. She hopes that one day, her husband will be able to fulfill his wishes and unfurl the blossoms of a great career.</p>
<p>In their happy life, the husband is especially fond of his considerate wife, and the wife, wishing to give her husband an even better, more wonderful image, begins to bear a beautiful fruit!</p>
<p>The beautiful fruit, one time, was plucked from a beautiful tree, and along with it came the beautiful roots, and the beautiful little pig was born into the world!</p>
<p>The grandfather was the first to purse his lips, revealing his most youthful smile! He felt that his life was truly worth living.</p>
<p>Every day he mechanically hugs his unfeeling grandson, opens his mouth, constantly smiling, his whiskers pricking the soft, tender little face. He feels more pleasure and meaning than from puffing on his long pipe for a long time.</p>
<p>He needs his son, for the sake of his own face, to host a grand soup and cake banquet for his grandson, which will naturally bring glory to the family!</p>
<p>A request that is not too demanding, and especially the duty that the newly appointed father, his son, should fulfill.</p>
<p>The days flew by the grandfather’s beard! Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the child will be one month old.</p>
<p>The day before, the young father came out from the company, his face as gloomy as the overcast sky after a rain.</p>
<p>The next day, the company's door was plastered with a lawyer's advertisement for a liquidation closure.</p>
<p>He stayed at home all day and did not go out. He told his wife that he had specially taken leave from the company to prepare for the child's one-month-old celebration. The wife was accordingly grateful and happy beyond measure! She even more enthusiastically busied herself preparing this and that, her hands and feet constantly busy.</p>
<p>The maternal grandmother sent a very exquisite, fist-sized golden wooden fish as a gift for her grandson. She made a phone call to let them know that she would take time out to come early the next morning.</p>
<p>The wife happily smiled from the bottom of her heart! But she also blamed her husband for being so inept, how could the wine and dishes not yet be finalized, and the invitation cards not yet sent out early? She said she was willing to invite a few good old classmates to come and see their little angel's little face. She immediately wrote out the invitation cards and asked the maid to deliver them one by one, urging them to definitely honor the appointment and come tomorrow!</p>
<p>After writing the invitation cards, she asked her husband if he needed her to write a few elegant invitation cards for his female friends?</p>
<p>She glanced at her husband with moving eyes, quietly waiting for him to give a very cheerful answer.</p>
<p>But the husband's face was very dejected! Not at all like he was so pleased with himself for hosting the banquet, and she became somewhat unnatural again!</p>
<p>She ran outside for a walk, and when she returned to the house, the husband had run out of the house at some unknown time!</p>
<p>It was not until the evening that she saw him coming home in great haste, his face still as cold as a white plaster cast, so frightening.</p>
<p>She sulkily lay down on the bed and ignored him.</p>
<p>The next day was the actual day of the one-month celebration. Early in the morning, the mother-in-law arrived, first hugging the beautiful grandson and kissing him again and again, her cheeks showing wrinkled chicken skin, and opening her mouth. He asked his daughter why she did not bring the golden wooden fish for the child to let her see it and be happy!</p>
<p>The daughter quickly ran over to open the jewelry box, but immediately cried out (ah)! She hurriedly sternly asked the maid if she had seen the golden wooden fish that Madam had put in the jewelry box for the young master? The maid was so frightened by this question that she felt cold in her heart: Didn't Madam put it in the jewelry box herself?</p>
<p>So she asked her husband again if he had seen it being moved to another place? The husband said that he had not seen the shadow of a golden wooden fish even once.</p>
<p>She was so anxious that she cried, money is not really important, but at least this is an ominous sign, for the child's entire future happiness! She cried so bitterly that the mother did not dare to say much to her. What does it matter if a wooden fish is lost, is it worth acting like that?</p>
<p>Guests arrived one after another, and the wine and dishes had been delivered two hours earlier.</p>
<p>When the guests left after enjoying themselves, the wife could not find her husband. At first, she thought that he was accompanying the guests outside, but later she waited and waited and he did not come back. The people from the restaurant had also left, and when she asked them, they said that they had already received the money! Ah: Then where exactly did he run off to?</p>
<p>The next day, the third day...the husband did not come home!</p>

<h3 id="e302">Disaster Survey <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Although it was late autumn, the weather was still so sultry. The sky was weighed down by a gray-brown cloud, as if a thunderstorm was about to break.</p>
<p>(Today, the county has sent a disaster survey committee to the countryside to survey the damage!) The drunkard A Gen ran over to Yao Jian Sheng, covered in sweat, and reported: (The village head, Wu Datou, told me, and he also asked me to tell you…)</p>
<p>Oh! I understand!) Before he could say anything else, Yao Jian Sheng cut him off, sweeping away the drunkard A Gen's enthusiasm. He himself still squinted his mouse-like eyes, constantly puffing on his long pipe, the pipe squeaking! squeaking! as he did so, watching the gray-white smoke rings he exhaled from his mouth disappear into the air, his expression as if he were planning something.</p>
<p>Yao Jian Sheng was a well-known local notable here. His family owned a pharmacy in this town, and business was very good, so now he had become a small wealthy family. Moreover, because of his skillful tactics, his name was actually quite well-known in the countryside, and even the local officials here had to seek his approval. He did not own any fields, nor was he a tenant farmer, so any disaster had nothing to do with him. However, these district chiefs, village heads, and whatnot, were afraid of him, so whenever anything big or small happened in the village, it seemed that his participation was always essential. The drunkard A Gen was a servant in his house, and today he had made such an effort, only to see his master's cold face, so he dejectedly grumbled and slunk away.</p>
<p>Wu Datou was really busy beyond measure, on the one hand arranging accommodation for the disaster survey committee, and on the other hand going to notify the various local notables. There were also many villagers who wanted to beg him for help, asking him to plead on their behalf before the disaster survey committee, asking him to report the disaster more severely to the county, and to report the percentage of damage more lightly.</p>
<p>The next day, Wu Datou accompanied the disaster survey committee to the countryside to inspect the situation on the ground. District Office Chief Mi, Yao Jian Sheng, and several wealthy and influential gentry were also among those accompanying them. The night before their departure, they had already agreed on a survey procedure, deciding to start from West Bay, return from East Village, and after surveying in this way for a week, they would have a basis when filling out the survey form and reporting to the county.</p>
<p>That disaster survey committee member was short in stature, with a long face, an eagle-like nose, and a Chaplin-style mustache under his nose. He was only around thirty years old, but he was already so old and serious. Although he had an air of authority in front of everyone, he could not hide his addiction to opium. He went to the countryside to investigate the situation on the ground, which was a ghost-driving charade. They sat in seven sedan chairs, going from east to west, from west to east, parading around like a great funeral procession. It was nothing more than putting on a ghost show, who really had the intention of surveying the disaster situation? It was not the sedan chair carriers' legs that suffered the misfortune.</p>
<p>This day was hosted by Yao Jian Sheng, and they had lunch at his house. Several local notables and District Chief Mi were of course guests, and Wu Datou acted as a temporary errand runner.</p>
<p>In the evening, the disaster survey situation was discussed in the district office. In addition to the original crew from the daytime, a district public security chief was added. Originally, according to the disaster survey committee member's proposal, they wanted to report 50% of the damage to the county. However, after everyone's discussion, it was decided to report 40% of the damage to the county, and the disaster survey committee member seemed to agree.</p>
<p>However, the villagers felt that the 40% figure was too unfavorable, and everyone expressed dissatisfaction, but what could they do? They were only dissatisfied in their hearts and dissatisfied in their mouths.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Winter Night Feelings <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Sitting on a circular chair, letting the soft lamplight caress my head, my whole body, and then lazily spilling into the corner of the room, listening to the howling of the wind outside, the low weeping of the rain, a feeling of utter boredom and desolation arises in my heart. Although the stove is burning, my heart is cold,颓唐的, like a pile of burnt incense ashes. At this time, all the past and future events, dressed in very seductive and charming clothes, cling to my side. This taste is also inexplicably mysterious.</p>
<p>Gazing at the dim, bloodless light, I think, only a short time ago, I could see the moon's brightness and the stars' brilliance through the window. The clear autumn sky brought a sense of Longjing tea or green olives, 清涩而又隽永之感. (In an instant, these have all passed quickly, leaving behind only cold, cold, this cold is like a spiral, deeply and sharply rotating into your heart. The艳冶 of spring, the 荣华 of summer, the 秀逸 of autumn, the blooming of flowers, the songs of birds, the sprouting of every plant and tree, the rotation of the sun, moon, and stars, all seem to have nothing to do with winter. What surrounds me is simply a漫漫无尽的 long night, this long night makes me lonely enough to want to cry.</p>
<p>When lonely enough to cry, just remain silent, like the gray sky. Take one or two harmless little books, light a peaceful cigarette, approach the stove, watch the coal gradually消鎔,灰化, watch the flames gradually蕩摇,變幻, it seems that all this before me symbolizes the growth and奄化 of life, say nothing,吐着思想 in your mind,吐着缭绕的 smoke at the corner of your lips, taking advantage of no one's attention, quietly 温理 the past life, this is just like flipping through old books,谛视着前代人的智慧 page by page,剪数着憔悴的 yellow flowers,怀念着消逝了的温馨瓣 by瓣, only in this unforced labor will it bring a深郁的回味, waiting until the stove fire burns out, the灯炧人倦, raise a cup of strong tea to凭吊着 yourself 孤獨的影子,映到墙上的, this can also bring you unspeakable deep comfort.</p>
<p>In my experience, winter nights are the most suitable for silent meditation. No one comes to disturb you, except for the sound of the wind, the sound of the rain, and the sound of the clock that seems to cut up time, and the city sound that is gradually消沉了下去的, because it is cold, you will never think of going out to play, you can only sit at home, because it is cold, you can not officially sit down to do some繁重的工作, or you have no family, or you have family and they are all asleep. Then, I tell you, the most suitable thing for you to do at this time is to quietly do a comfortable fantasy. Every day we are busy,喧嚣,争执,追逐, for food and clothing or for something else in life, thus磨去 us the years that will never return, if there is such an opportunity, allowing you to静下心来, take a真挚的凝视 at life, you silently thinking, silently laughing, as Owen said, this small room is your one person's kingdom, this circle chair is your one person's寶座,随你愤怒,你哀悼,你鼓舞,你歌唱, no one will管你, at this time, your spirit that has not been没世俗的得到茁发与伸长, this life 最自由的一刹那 is simply可说是一刻千金!</p>
<p>After you追忆,感慨,怀念, and all this has passed, the night has slipped away一大段不知不觉中, the sky is black, the people are quiet, then you can easily take off the shackles of the clothes on your body, and use the comfort of sleep to抵償 this day's fatigue.</p>

Yu Shuyan, beauty concealed within the mountain forests of his secluded abode. Li Jilui, auspicious energy lingers in his aging body. Yang Xiaolou, tall in stature and highly valued. Ma Lianliang, a fine talent cultivated into artistic excellence. Tan Fuying, heroic and handsome, inheriting the mantle. Yan Jupeng, his peers and confidants all esteem him. Zhao Ruquan, pure as spring water, genuinely incorruptible. Qilin Tong, famous even in his childhood. Gai Jiaotian, innately brave and skilled in short weaponry. Jin Shaoshan, his voice like a mountain wind shaking the peaks. Mei Lanfang, his magnificent mansion bestowed with a doctorate. Cheng Yanqiu, a return journey from overseas in the autumn wind. Shang Xiaoyun, light and graceful as mist and clouds. Gou Huisheng, naturally beautiful, as if a celestial being. Bai Yukun, standing alone on the Kunlun peaks. Li Wanchun, his talents declared like the Spring of Shen. Wang Yunfang, her fame rises like a magpie, standing at the Jiangyi stage. Lin Shusen, serious and upright, truly all-capable. Gao Baisui, his age brings artistic reinvigoration. Xue Yanqin, her lute hall rejoices in meeting a soulmate. Meng Xiaodong, already paired with Mei Lang at Dongling. Lu Lanchun, secluded in her spring boudoir, her voice unheard. Qian Jinfu and Hao Shouchun, an unparalleled pair with copper hammers. Think of how these individuals did not achieve fame easily. It was all through their own dedication, morning and night. I am now limited by time and cannot fully express myself. I will wait for leisure time to continue. I will still broadcast for you all to hear.</p>

<p>Opening (Young Wife Cries for Her Young Husband)</p>
<p>A round bright moon reflects before the window. The beautiful woman inside is not yet asleep. Dressed in mourning white, covered in filial attire. Sparkling tears hang on her red cheeks. She cries, saying that separation in life will eventually have a day of reunion, but how can death allow us to speak together again? My husband has left our child. We, a pair of orphans, are the most pitiable. That mother-in-law treats me so cruelly, using a leather whip to harshly beat me. She says you are a prodigal, ill-fated, and fated to kill your husband, scolding me as a jinx. Then there's that little sister-in-law, stirring things up, her sharp tongue too cunning. Having eaten all kinds of hardships, today, life is like a year. Thinking back to our first meeting at my uncle's house, our affections connected. Thinking back to the engagement, how joyful it was, calling each other brother and sister. Thinking back to holidays and Sundays, going out together, the sweetness of love in the cinema. Thinking back to that wedding night, how we rejoiced, harmonious as fish and water, our hearts intertwined. Thinking back to our honeymoon trip to Suzhou, the beautiful scenery of Tianping and Mudu. Thinking back to the Tangbing celebration, guests congratulating us, the whole family celebrating the joyous occasion. Thinking of last autumn when I was sick, you accompanied me morning and night by the bed. Thinking of the times we playfully joked in the boudoir, the times we meticulously studied academics together. The times we played Western music on the piano together, the times we sang a song and played the strings together. Four years have passed easily, never a quarrel, like ascending to immortality. So it was that we respected each other like honored guests, our love harmonious like zithers. We hoped to grow old together, living a hundred years. Who knew that a thunderbolt would strike from the clear sky, my husband struck down by typhoid fever and entered the Yellow Springs. How pitiful, half of the brocade quilt on the bed is now empty. What joy do I have in this world? My heart breaks into a thousand pieces. I cry out, "Husband!" and call to the heavens. My cries make the heavens sad and the earth miserable, even a heart of stone would shed tears. After crying for a while, she becomes dazed, wondering why the heavens are jealous of beauty. The newly widowed Wenjun finds it hard to endure.</p>

<h3 id="e309">1935 American Automobile Production Plan <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>丨丨Ford and General Motors Factories丨丨</p>
<p>Major American automobile factories anticipate that automobile demand in 1935 will increase compared to previous years, so they are expanding their production plans for the manufacture of new cars this year to ensure that production and sales are aligned. The New York Auto Show is scheduled to be held in early January. Based on past experience, after the auto show opens, new car sales tend to jump sharply. Consequently, the end of January is the peak sales period for various new cars. However, in reality, the timing of new car launches varies from factory to factory, some in late winter, others in early spring, but the majority occur at the end of the year. When the New York Auto Show is held, all factories simultaneously display their brand-new cars at the show venue for the public to inspect and appreciate. Customers who want to buy cars choose the cars they like from the dazzling and colorful auto show. Therefore, at this time, not only is the factory under great pressure in terms of manufacturing, but also each dealer is vying for customers and showing their strengths to clear a path for their new cars to sell well. This refers to the initial sales competition among car dealers at the beginning of the year. Now, the 1935 production plans of the two major stars among American automobile manufacturers, Ford and General Motors, are described separately below. After reading them, we can understand how optimistic and sweet the automobile dealers view 1935.</p>
<p>We can imagine the enormous scale of Ford's 1935 production plan from their projected figures. Ford plans to manufacture 1,000,000 cars in 1935, worth $415,000,000. This huge number will be sold by 6,000 dealers in the United States. Just in terms of car bodies, those manufactured entirely by Detroit factories will be worth $100,000,000. The steel, iron, and non-ferrous metals required for car manufacturing are worth approximately $75,000,000. In terms of steel alone, in addition to what is produced in Ford's own factories, another $53,600,000 will be spent on purchases from the market. In addition, $6,618,000 will be spent on purchasing malleable cast iron, and $2,683,000 on wrought iron. These are special metal products from the world's largest Rouge River Ford steel and forging factory. The value of wood is $3,000,000.</p>
<p>Rubber is consumed in large quantities in automobile manufacturing, so in 1935, Ford estimates that the tires sold to them by various rubber factories will be worth $22,500,000, and raw rubber $6,000,000. The cost of manufacturing and decorating car bodies is $32,000,000, of which $16,727,000 is used for the needs of cushions, carpets, leather, and decorative items, $11,000,000 for glass, and $4,300,000 for paint.</p>
<p>In terms of manufacturing, Ford has already invested $14,000,000 to expand its steel and power plants. The mechanical equipment in the factories will require another $2,500,000. Ford will pay $74,000,000 in railway transportation fees this year due to transportation needs. The total payroll for Ford's Detroit factory employees will also be $6,861,000. Ford's factories employed 53,000 workers at the end of this summer. Currently, the number has decreased due to changes in the production plan. If the above-mentioned plan is fully implemented, then the estimated number of employees will be 87,000. Former Ford factory workers and machinists in the Detroit area will be hired to work.</p>
<p>General Motors' 1935 production volume is also expected to be very large, but the company's management believes that it is better to distribute the work during the peak production period evenly throughout the year, rather than having a large output at the end of the year, which would cause extreme tension in terms of work. This avoids the unsuitability of both financial and human resources. For this reason, General Motors' 1935 production plan is slightly different from the past. Although they have not formally announced the new car manufacturing plan, it is said that they will first manufacture the Pontiac, then the Chevrolet, and then the Oldsmobile. As for the 1935 Buick, LaSalle, and Cadillac, the public will not know the details until a few months later. We can understand why General Motors wants to predetermine their production plan by reading the following explanation:</p>
<p>According to General Motors executives, the only purpose of adopting the above plan in 1935 is to enable the employed workers to obtain continuous work. The method is to enable the work process in a year to develop evenly, distributing the large amount of work during the peak production period evenly throughout the year. Therefore, the new General Motors car models may not necessarily be seen in early spring, perhaps they will be seen by the public in late summer or early autumn. As for the current situation, General Motors, like other companies, mostly launches all new cars at the end of the year. New cars are rarely seen at other times.</p>
<p>Speaking of the seasonal relationship of car sales, it is also a very interesting and noteworthy matter, because the car market is similar to other markets, with a period of the year when sales are most prosperous, becoming the peak of sales. According to conventional practice, the most popular period for car sales in a year is the first six months of each year, from January to the end of June. The cars sold during this period often account for 60% of the total annual sales. The weakest selling season in a year is the winter months of November and December. At that time, because new cars have not yet been launched, buyers are waiting and hesitant, so the number of transactions only accounts for 7.5%. Sales in April and May account for 24%. From the above figures, we can know that the production situation in the middle of the year is very uncertain. For example, it suddenly expands in the turn of spring and summer, but in the off-season, workers and work must be reduced. This back and forth has both excessive and insufficient phenomena in terms of management and economy. In the busy season, workers have to extend working hours and expand the capacity of work, but in winter, because of sluggish sales, the production volume has to be greatly reduced. The workers' on-again, off-again situation is really very uneconomical, so the General Motors authorities are trying to even out the work, avoiding such tension and slackness, which is very clear.</p>
<h3 id="e310">Rigorous Inspection and Various Features of the Hudson and Terraplane New Cars <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The final road tests and laboratory tests of the 1935 Terraplane and Hudson new cars have now been completely completed. These vehicles will soon be assembled and shipped from the Hudson factory. All the testing work applied to these new cars has been extremely detailed and rigorous. For road driving alone, the total distance has exceeded 500,000 miles. Some of these cars have been traveling on the road, and their mileage has not been less than 100,000 miles. One of the 1935 engines was recently tested with the most rigorous power meter. This type of testing was only applied to aircraft engines in the past, and no car engine has ever been subjected to such rigorous testing.</p>
<p>During the implementation of this power meter test, the engine was driven for as long as nine days under full load. It was driven for 208 hours at a car speed of 76 to 84 miles per hour. As for the crankshaft, it made a total of 50 million revolutions during this test. Each piston traveled approximately 8,000 miles. The spark plugs fired a total of 25 million times. Therefore, using it at the highest gear for a whole year may be roughly equivalent to this test. In this test, the total mileage of the car reached 17,000 miles. Based on the results of this laboratory test and road test, the factory is engaged in the research and improvement of its products, striving for perfection. The performance and robustness of these Terraplane and Hudson new cars are therefore more advanced than before, and their outstanding performance is unparalleled.</p>
<p>One of the features of the new car is the all-steel roof formed by fusion welding. Since the invention of the steel body, this roof has been the dream of body manufacturers. Now, the Hudson factory is uniquely able to solve all the problems and adopt it first. It is truly commendable and valuable. Another feature of the new car is the application of new car management methods. The adoption of new methods has completely cleared the front compartment of the shift lever and handbrake lever. The Hudson Motor Company is currently keeping the details of this new method secret. However, this feature will surely be the most talked about feature of the 1935 new car models by car enthusiasts. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance, the low, long, and wide body of the new car surpasses the popular styles on the market. As for the excellent and outstanding performance, even the previous styles that have repeatedly created unprecedented records are inferior. This has been proven by various rigorous tests.</p>

<p>Mr. Max Ferryman, the general manager of the China Motor Company, who is famous in the automobile industry for managing Dodge cars, returned to his home country last year. Now that he has completed his work, he has brought the 1935 Dodge new car and his wife and daughter, as well as the general manager of the Dodge factory, on the Hoover wheel to Shanghai. They arrived in port yesterday. In the picture of the car in the country, the majestic figure of the 1935 new Dodge is standing next to the car. From left to right are the general manager of Dodge, Mr. Ferryman's wife, Mr. Ferryman, and Mr. Ferryman's daughter.</p>

<p>The news that the Chrysler Airflow new car is about to be released has been widely spread in the automobile industry in Shanghai. Although the exact situation of the new car is still unknown, it is said that the new transmission and clutch assembled in the new car are unprecedented. Its spaciousness and horsepower are also doubled compared to the past. In addition, what is particularly commendable is that in terms of gasoline consumption, the economic efficiency of the new car is said to exceed the previous year's model by an average of 30%. If this is the case, then it can be asserted that people in the automobile industry in Shanghai are eagerly looking forward to this new car and want to see it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e313">Current Situation of Charcoal Cars in Hunan Province (Continued) <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>Now, summarizing my (Xia Zhengkun's self-proclaimed) personal experience and humble opinions, the application of charcoal in highway transportation is indeed an urgent and vigorously promoted key measure. We all know that charcoal cars are not yet perfect, so they have not been widely adopted. However, for our country that does not produce a drop of gasoline, if we want to talk about national defense and recovering leakage, then even if charcoal cars have some unsatisfactory aspects, we can only temporarily endure them.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, charcoal cars in countries such as France, Japan, and Italy can be said to have achieved success. Even in the case of Hunan Province, it has indeed reached the level of application. Therefore, we should not talk about national defense. If we want to talk about national defense, unless we establish a large oil mine, we should spare no effort in all important materials that can replace gasoline, such as charcoal and alcohol. Even the so-called charcoal cars of today are just adding a gas stove. (Except for this, the machinery is still completely gasoline car machinery) In fact, it is because of the limitation of the unremodeled vehicle machinery that unsatisfactory aspects are inevitable. (The biggest dissatisfaction is the lack of power uphill) If we are willing to invest heavily in the remodeling of the entire vehicle, then charcoal cars will be more suitable, which can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Now, taking Hunan Province as an example, the use of charcoal cars (or gas cars) is not yet widespread. Only the provincial government has instructed the Changheng section (Changsha to Hengyang) to be the route for the trial use of charcoal cars. The section is 182 kilometers long, and there are currently 89 charcoal cars running between them. (Used as ordinary long-distance buses) But in reality, there are very few charcoal cars from Changsha to Hengyang. When I and others were in Hunan (end of February 1934), the charcoal cars in the province were only used for transportation in the section from Changsha to Xia Shesi. The mileage of this section is only 57 kilometers. From this, it can be seen that charcoal cars in the province are still in the trial period. Even the engineer Xiang De, who was designated by the province to study charcoal cars, said that these vehicles are mostly experimental in nature. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e316">Hollywood Astrologer Dariès's Predictions for 1935 (Part 2) <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>The Hollywood prophet Dariès also has the following predictions for the future of major stars:</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert will encounter a form of violent act, whether unintentional or deliberate, before spring or after autumn this year. She will experience two major changes within the year, but by the end of the year, she will follow Garbo and hide herself away. She will be involved in a scandal this year. If Neil Hamilton wants to film an aviation movie, he will encounter an unexpected disaster. If he hires a stunt double, the stunt double will certainly lose his life or be seriously injured. Kay Francis will be emotionally moved by something this year. She will marry a world-famous star, but the result will be extremely poor, as their personalities are inherently unsuitable for marriage. She will film a movie in Europe, but it will not be successful either.</p>
<p>Maurice Chevalier will marry a dark-haired movie star (referring to Kay Francis), but the result will not be good. He will suffer serious injuries or a broken leg this year. 1935 is the period of Bing Crosby's decline in the film industry. He will soon return to radio, but he will go to England to film a movie. One of his children will become seriously ill, but not fatally. Miriam Hopkins will enjoy great fame this year. Her love life will continue for the next three years, but she will still not marry him. There are rumors that Carole Lombard will reunite with her ex-husband, but this will ultimately not come true. She will marry a man outside the film industry, with a very satisfactory result. She will be hospitalized for several weeks this spring.</p>
<p>Jean Harlow will have great achievements in her career this year, but will not be very happy emotionally. In early spring this year, a film mogul will lose his wife and propose to Jean. But she loves another person, who cannot marry her. As a result, she will marry another movie star, not from MGM. Her marriage will not be happy either. Jean Harlow has no hope of a happy marriage in her lifetime. Gloria Swanson will have unprecedented achievements this year, but she will experience infinite pain in love. Remarriage is possible, but not certain. Adolphe Menjou will become seriously ill between summer and autumn this year. There will also be illness in his family, perhaps his wife, but the family will be harmonious. He will have a son.</p>
<p>Sylvia Sidney will marry this year, but she values ​​her career, so she will continue to work in film after her marriage. By the end of the year, she will suffer from extreme neurasthenia. Mae West's film career will come to an end this year. Afterward, she will focus on writing, producing films, or returning to the stage, resulting in unparalleled success. She will not marry this year, but someone will kidnap or harm her because she has offended people in the lower classes of society. She will have great success on stage in 1936.</p>
<p>Clark Gable will encounter an unexpected disaster this summer. He will be accused by a woman of seducing her daughter. The matter is fabricated, but it will take a lot of unnecessary publicity before the truth comes out. In terms of career, this year will be a year of success for him, but in terms of family, there will be illness. George Raft has reached the highest position in his career. In 1935, he will decline. He wants a divorce but cannot get one, because his wife is firmly opposed to the divorce.</p>
<p>Barbara Stanwyck will file for divorce from her husband this year, but the result will be complete reconciliation, and the couple will be as good as new. She will adopt a red-haired adopted daughter. Loretta Young will have smooth sailing from May this year, enjoying three years of success. She will have great conflicts in her career and love. But she should at least wait until 1936 to get married, because a union before 1936 is unfavorable. After Jeanette Gaynor marries this year, her life will be very happy. But her film career will also come to an end. Shirley Temple will continue to rise this year, but some people want to kidnap her.</p>
<p>Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks's future is very dangerous. There is no possibility for them to restore their marital relationship permanently, but their friendship can still be preserved. Mary will no longer make movies, but will engage in writing and directing. She will have extremely unhappy things happen this year because of a man born in mid-August. Douglas Fairbanks's film career has not developed much. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. will stay in England and marry an actress in England, but the result will not be very happy.</p>
<p>Charles Farrell's acting career will come to an end, and he will work as a director from now on. Ann Harding will have a great film success this year. Jeanette MacDonald will get married this year. She will be deceived, and her jewelry will be stolen by bandits. The remaining predictions are too numerous to mention. Let's wait and see how the above points turn out. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e317">Review of "His Greatest Gamble" <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>His Greatest Gamble</p>
<p>丨 Da Shanghai</p>
<p>A romance story is often very touching. This is a movie adapted from a romantic novel. Thanks to John Robertson's excellent directing skills, it is concretely expressed in pictures, and its touching power is truly profound and moving.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the best thing here is the director's technique, especially his handling of mood and atmosphere. He mostly doesn't use music to help the picture, but in the main scenes, the music powerfully enhances the plot (not added music, but the sound effects that should be in the play). The piano sound when Feilipu escapes from prison and visits his daughter at night, such as the gramophone when Feilipu allows his daughter and lover to meet, are all excellent performances. Yes, the director grasps the tone of the play extremely well. From the beginning to the end, he unfolds the bitter taste of life in a quiet atmosphere, and the power of the urgent and agile movements in the rapid rain when Feilipu escapes from prison, such a description, is indeed rare in other films.</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be said that Richard Dix, who played Feilipu, was too rational, not enough to thicken the emotion of the play. Yes, this may not be a loss to this film. But this is ultimately an unrealistic romance. Even if it is said to be very emotional, it will inevitably feel empty to the general audience who demands a realistic expression of the movie.</p>
<h3 id="e318">Review of "Before Midnight" <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>Before Midnight 丨 Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>Covered with a mysterious coat on detective films 丨 such as the recent "Dragon Pool Key" and "Thirteen Women" and the current "Before Midnight", this fact, besides explaining those who escape reality, and many old Chinese novels (when the mountains and rivers are exhausted, the gods come to the rescue) · such absurdities, the only difference is that one side (performs brilliantly on the spot), and the other side first sets up an atmosphere and develops it in a deliberately mysterious way.</p>
<p>Wanting to use so-called mystery to make up for an unintelligible story, this "Before Midnight" is self-defeating, and there are still many unintelligible places. First of all, the relationship between the main characters in the assassination case that serves as the center of this film is not close to the facts. Yes, it is common for people who live a decadent life to change their names because of love or other ugly disputes, but it is too far-fetched to change their names in order to prevent their illegitimate children from knowing their own ugliness, which leads to property disputes and evolves into such a tragedy.</p>
<p>Naturally, after the rich merchant Mr. Ya was killed, the author made the secretary, the secretary's wife, the adopted daughter Qin Qi, the consulting doctor Massey, the waiter Japanese Kuno, the banker Ge Han, whose credit was shaken, and even the maid, all suspected of murder. In terms of relationship and atmosphere, the arrangement is not too bad. In fact, if it can be more precise in structure, why must you use some mysterious ancient clock as a gimmick?</p>
<p>From the perspective of performance, the director Lambert Hillyer is quite attentive. However, due to the shortcomings of the script itself, it finally failed to escape the cliché of ordinary detective films. Among them, the battlefield, which is an important cloud in the development of the plot and also the key to solving the case, such as Fula's wife sneaking into Mr. Ya's bedroom in the dark night, encountering lawyer Smith stealing a woman's diary, Kuno eavesdropping outside the room. Kuno was forced by the detective and was about to reveal the truth, but was suddenly killed by a flying knife, and when the secretary handed the diary to his wife, the detective was hanging outside the window peeking. The producers made great efforts to desperately create an atmosphere of tension and horror, which can certainly grab the audience's attention for a while, but the more sophisticated audience will know that this is just a cliché and old tune in ordinary detective films.</p>
<p>The whole film is darker, with particularly many night scenes. This kind of use of photography techniques such as shadows, dark corners, heavy rain, and lightning to increase doubts and horror is also a (family heirloom) commonly used by detective films.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Ralph Bellamy, who played the detective, performed only adequately, just enough to be strong and healthy, but lacking in intelligence and composure. Claude Gillingwateri, who played the secretary Fula, had a rather good attitude of being a murderer and having nothing to do with it. Retly Blyche's secretary's wife is also very good.</p>

<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Connie was originally sobbing, but after Dillon entered the bedroom and slammed the door, she stopped crying, and her shoulders stopped moving up and down. She raised her head from her cupped hands and smiled sweetly at Dillon's bedroom, with no tears on her face. She thought, "Might as well go all the way and pretend." So she slowly lay down on the floor, spreading her dress on the ground. She readily knocked over a glass of water on the table, causing the water to flow down from the table. After everything was arranged, she reached out and pulled a table lamp next to her. With a crash, the table lamp fell to the ground. She closed her eyes and lay on the floor, hearing the sound, the bedroom door opened······Dillon ran out and quickly walked to her side. She desperately held back her laughter, gritted her teeth, and straightened her charming corners of her mouth············</p>
<p>The next morning, Herbert and Geoffrey woke up in their hotel room. They felt groggy. Geoffrey soon woke up. He suddenly remembered the bachelor's dinner party last night. He also remembered that Dillon had not attended. He jumped out of bed in a flash. At this time, the manager and deputy manager of the hotel were knocking on their door to negotiate with them because they had opened the water pipe in the bathroom all night, and the flood had flowed down, damaging two floors, and they had to pay for the loss.</p>
<p>Geoffrey thought he couldn't manage so many things. He had things to do that were bigger than the sky. Mary was getting married this afternoon, and it was already eleven o'clock. He got out of bed and immediately went to the phone to call the phone number of a flower shop. This was when Herbert was still lying in bed, half-awake, with his eyes half-open and half-closed, asking, "What are you doing?" Geoffrey said, "From the time we were little, Mary loved cornflowers the most. Today is her wedding day, and I should at least send her some cornflowers. I'll buy all the cornflowers they have and send them to Mary······".</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the flower shop sent many, many cornflowers to Mary's house. In her dressing room, many bridesmaids and Paula were busy around Mary. Mary smiled at the many cornflowers and said, "Dillon has a good heart and sent so many cornflowers. When I was little, I liked to sleep in cornflowers······I once said that I would wear a cornflower dress when I got married. Fortunately, Dillon has a good memory, he still remembers it."</p>
<p>That's right, Dillon has a good memory. He remembers everything, except one thing, he forgot to go to the church. Relatives and friends have arrived. The seats in the church were full. The choir on the stage sang for a long time, and their throats were about to sing hoarse. Everyone stretched their necks and waited for the groom to come, but the groom didn't know where he had gone. The guests gradually felt surprised and uneasy. Geoffrey ran out and went to Dillon's apartment to see what was going on. Soon, he came back. Mary greeted him with a bitter smile. Geoffrey's face was ashen. He almost didn't know what to do. He almost couldn't speak. He grabbed Mary's arm and said, "Mary······I······".</p>
<p>Mary knew that something was wrong, and her face changed in fright. She quickly asked, "What's wrong? Is he sick······He······" Geoffrey said, "Mary······he's already married······" Mary followed suit, "Married?" Paula interjected, "Who did he marry?" Herbert said, "Connie Barnes!" Everyone then looked at Mary. She reluctantly asked Geoffrey, "You're not kidding me, are you? Tell me the truth······Don't tease me······". (To be continued)</p>
