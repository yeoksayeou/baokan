<p>— 恒</p>
<p>自德國宣布重整軍備而後。歐洲局勢。一時頓形嚴重。致使積極對阿備戰之意大利。不能不稍稍移其汴意於歐洲。因之意阿關係爲之鬆弛。唯至最近數日。歐洲方面因斯特里薩會議之結果。法俄恊定之成立危機稍戢。於是意之對阿。又有大刀闊斧放手做去之氣槪。意國當局一則曰。意政府對於阿國時局不能再予優容。再則曰。阿國並非一同一種族同一宗敎之國家。三則曰。意國對阿實有澄淸。大局之必要。同時墨索里尼又下令意兵準備戰事。窺其意旨。大有非對阿國幹一痛快不止之努。</p>
<p>自來對於阿國有利害關係之國家。爲美法意三國。於十九世紀之末。非洲士地。十九瓜分。唯阿國以地勢關係。屹然獨存。其時英恐此地爲法所得。故頗慫恿意大利圖之。於是引起法之猜忌。積極獲取阿國之友誼。爲阿訓練軍隊。供給軍火。一八九六年阿國所以能擊敗意大利圖阿之師者。以得法國之助也。自是而後。意人對阿之雄心雖爲稍戢。唯英人欲控制阿國之藏奈湖。藉握埃及尼羅河之水源。其志迄未稍沮。故於一九〇二年威脅阿王締結英阿條約。獲取藏奈湖建築水閘之權。同時仍煽意人圖阿。藉收漁利。唯法人此時則常以維持阿國之領上完整爲職志。故對英意之行動。每思所以阻止之。如一九〇六年由法方發動訂立之英法意三國對阿協定。卽爲保障阿國土地完整之其同約束。一九二三年阿國之加入國聯。亦出於法之介紹。一九二五年英之張伯倫謀與墨索里尼成立劃分勢力範圍之諒解。亦以法人反對而失敗故自十九世紀以來。最關心阿國之土地完整者。莫若法國至於英國。對阿雖無領土野心。然欲控制尼羅河上流之水源。對阿不能絕無所求。人情有所求而不得。則不免怨望。甚或樂借他人之力以快已意。此英人對於意之圖阿。所以往往優容也。</p>
<p>三國對阿旣有如是之錯綜關係。則今次意大利之對阿行動。苟非獲有英法兩國之諒解或默許。當難放手做去。其中尤以法國之諒解爲不可少。自去夏以來。因德國圖奧之急進。法意二國矛盾漸消。及至今春。遂有法意羅馬恊定之成立。觀於法國於此協定中許意人參預由阿京直達法屬索謀里蘭鐵路之管理權。可知法人今日實已放棄其助阿抗意之政策。蓋此路爲法國獨力所經營。亦爲阿國對外交涌之唯一路綫阿之對外貿易與軍火之輸入。胥賴此路爲溝通。意人今能參預此路之管理。則於軍火之檢查上當能予阿國以絕大之打擊。法國旣以此權與之意人。是其不再助阿之意已昭然若揭。復次。阿國對於國聯迭提申訴。始終未被列入行政院之議程中。法於國聯中號召之力甚大。若欲加以援助。其事何難。今乃熟視無覩。則其意旨所在又何待言。又在事實上。法國旣欲意國贊助其安定歐局之種種計劃。並欲意國不助奧匈以與小恊約爲難。自非對意爲極大之讓步不可。此所以不能不默視墨索里尼對阿之行動也。</p>
<p>意人今次對阿之行動。獲有英法非正式之諒斛。已成公開之秘密。唯墨氏是否對阿卽有用兵之决心。則尙難逆料。蓋一則阿國之十地完整。爲一九〇六年英法意之三國協定所承認。二則阿國現爲國聯之會員國。英法今皆欲以全力維護國聯而充實之。何能永久坐視阿國之被侵。且一九二八年意阿訂有仲裁條約又何能棄而不顧。二則依據一九二五年張伯倫向墨索里尼之建議。不過許意於阿境築一橫貫鐵路。過此以往。恐非英人所能許而阿國地處高原崇山峻嶺。遍於國內。易守難攻自昔爲然。益以阿人之慓悍善戰。意人雖有　利之軍火。究不能絕無戒心也。故揣墨氏之意。併吞阿國或無其心。特欲對阿示威。脅其就範耳。近年以來。意人因意阿界綫之不明。蠶食阿國領土頗多。爲欲保持此等侵地。亦非出以極强硬之態度不可。且爲應付二次大戰計。意國不能不積極喚起國民之戰爭情緒。而今茲之意阿糾紛。實爲培養此種情緒之絕好資料。以墨索里尼目光四射。對此足以鼓勵國民戰爭情緒之大好機會。自不肯輕易放過也。</p>

<p>拉氏述及前世記末葉之文件、卽於四十四年以前法蘭西共和國與帝俄談判同盟事、指明當時帝俄之情形、其言曰、「當時俄國須向法國訂購來福槍五十萬支、因　俄本國不能生產、同時彼以國庫貧乏、須向另一國家舉債償還、當時之俄國、在外交談判中不能得對等之地位、」</p>

<h3 id="c138">德意志的浪漫主義 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>浪漫主義因各個別國家底政治經濟及文學的條件底不同，在其產生上乃有快　之分，在其進步的性質上，也就有明顯或隱晦之別；另一方面，則出於各作家所屬的社會之不同，在本質上及表現為進步的（與曆史底發展法則相一致）和退化的（和曆史底發展法則相違背）兩種樣式。</p>
<p>退化的貴族的浪漫主義，以充溢於作品中之對於現實的回避耽於非合理化的幻想為其特徴：回顧的傾向——如專從沒落的封建貴族世界中汲取其形象和題材，回避英國的現代性而趨向於仍保留著自然，經濟組織的拜倫（Byron）及以中世生活為題材的施各脫（Scott）；向農村之逃遁——對都市取否定態度，以都市為污濁的萬惡之源而從獨立農民中見出道德上最健康的人民之威茨威斯（Wordsworth）。同樣，在十八世紀前後二三十年間的德意志，在浪漫主義文學上也現著兩種不同的姿態。雖然在這時期中，因一方面是貴族的構成及農奴制的崩潰，而另一方面新興市民，尚不曾掌握到政治經濟底指導的權力，故面那種回顧的幻想的色彩極濃烈地染上了兩種不同的浪漫主義的詩歌上，可是，即使在這一點上，我們也還可以看出不同的地方：退化的浪漫主義底回顧的幻想的性質，主要地是因為這一集團已經完成了它的歷史的使命和任務，失卻了對於現存社會的支配能力，這種在急劇轉變中的實現使他發生一種沒落感，因而不敢正視現實，回避它，而沉醉於其年青的繁榮時代底種種偉績底回憶，以這種回憶來充滿他自己的生活，安慰自己，同時也以之粉飾現實，把現實理想化，美化。如胡格（Friedrich　　Fouque）和亞爾尼門（Archim　　Von　　Arnim）便是這種藝術的表現者。</p>
<p>作為這時期向前的浪漫主義者之一人的霍夫曼（Amadeus　　Hoffmann），雖然在其作品中有時也表現出一種回顧的幻想的性質，然而他的幻想是從他所描寫的日常生活的現實中生長出來的，他所回顧的並不是騎士的牧歌的封建時代，而是中世紀末的德意志的都市（如在其「桶匠師傅馬爾丁及其學徒門」中之描寫中世紀末德意志都市中的手工業者的生活及其相互間的關系），這種幻想，是健康的，是感覺到初期的市民社會底狹窄，而向著更廣闊的世界的憧憬，是「在理想的詩國的形式上去描寫更有廣大意義的未來生活之文學」。他的幻想，可以說得是由於對新社會的未來抱著熱烈的希望和祈求而來的，這樣的幻想是現實的，是包含於現實本身中的必然性底形象化，因而獲得了最高的評價。</p>
<p>十九世紀四十年代的德意志，由於社會經濟的諸形態之變化，小工業底崩壞，機械時代與全生活商業化時代之興隆，於是在思想界突放異彩。</p>
<p>這時候，德意志已開始從半貴族的警察監督，從羅曼蒂克的夢想，從牧歌的睡眠，神學的形而上學的氛圍中解放出來。故而這時候浪漫主義文學底面相，乃更加多樣化複雜化起來。新的抒情詩底樣式——政治抒情詩，就是這時期底產物。政治抒情詩之最偉大的完成者是海涅（Heine）。急進的民主主義者的詩人海涅的全生涯，正橫於由封建社會的崩壞到資本主義社會的確立，他的生活即呼吸著變革的社會中。由此，他之確信未來的勝利，而又確信宗教的必要性；僧侶與帝王底猛烈的攻擊者，而另一方面卻又是謳歌愛，百合花，夜嗚鶯的抒情詩：是豐眼絕代的預言者，同時也是狹量的俗物。這種過渡期中智識份子底不安定性，在海涅底創作中以極明確的方法被表現了出來。</p>
<p>給與海涅底時事的，政治的抒情詩以顯著的特色者，是海涅在創作上所特有的方法，特殊的浪漫主義，他並不是在其元本的姿態上表現作為對象的現實，而乃是使現實變貌為空想的物而構成穿想的世界，布闡兌斯（Brandes）把這種方法稱為現實底浪漫的變形的方支，故而海涅底多數的詩（如德意志·冬之童話）中之「現實和影底交錯，正如他自己稱自己的詩篇為「政治的浪漫」一樣，是海涅底詩所特有的東西。</p>
<p>海涅以一種熱烈的感情和冷靜的機智織入於其抒情詩中，而予普魯士的王侯，僧侶尢其「法王至上論者」以痛罵和嘲弄，他底像尖刺似的諷刺和嘲笑底尖銳的音　，給與這些人物以強有力的打擊。</p>
<p>海涅雖然不曾獲得一個固定的徹底統一的世界觀，因而使他在認識現實上表現出相當的混亂；然而這種苦惱，正是那時代他的所有人們底苦惱，是時代底苦惱。</p>
<p>此外，和海涅同型的依姆麥曼（Immermann），在這裏只好簡略了。</p>

<h3 id="c140">作家的良心 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 佐木</p>
<p>「良心」這概念，通常是被抽象化和神秘化了；絕對的，一般的良心，事實上恐怕沒有。平常人們所謂「天良發現」，照弗羅伊特（Frued）的「精神分析學」的方法來加以探究，好像是相當於人類的「潛意識」那東西。可是這種解釋法結局也是鑽在「牛角尖」裏，因為就是人類的「潛意識」也吧，那根柢的基石，並不是弗羅伊特所說的libido，而是人類的社會境遇。不同的社會境遇，當然不能夠產生一般的普遍的「良心」。</p>
<p>這只是說人類「良心」之不同，並不是說人類根本沒有良心這東西。不，有「良心」的人，何時何地都存有的。</p>
<p>我們看紀德（Andre　　Gide）的一生，真是一出偉大的良心的悲劇。初時，他像「田園交響樂中的盲女熱露托留德一樣，充滿著響往於真理的憧憬：「地上的小鳥，真像所說的那麼美麗麼？為什麼人們一點也不將這事告訴我？」，現實所給與他的苦悶和殘酷，成為他探求真理的燃料。人們說他的生活改變，是由於柏格森哲學的影響；然而，事實上，這卻是現實的諸條件，給與一個有「良心」的作家之感動所致成的。盲女熱露托留德雙睛複明所說的話，好像是紀德在替現在的自己舒懷一樣：「我的眼睛被張開了，對著比想像更美麗的世界。是的，我實在沒有想到太陽是這樣的明亮，空氣是這樣地輝煌，天空是這樣的辽廣！」</p>
<p>在現實的烘爐中，作家的舊意識的廢料，有時會被燒脫了，這時候，他的「良心」越炼越精超，堅確。不斷地和現實的洪流，交互波動。</p>
<h3 id="c141">送阿寶出黃金時代 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 子愷</p>
<p>阿寶，我和你在世間相聚，至今已十四年了，在這五千多天內，我們差不多天天在一處，難得有分別的日子。我看你呱呱墜地，牙牙學語，看你由吃奶改為吃飯，由匍匐學成跨步。你的神態微微地逐漸地改進，沒有痕跡，使我全然不知不覺，以為你始終是我家的一個孩子，始終是我們這家庭裏的一種點綴，始終可做我和你母親的生活的慰安者。然而近年來，你的態度行為的變化，漸漸證明其不然。你已在我們的不知不覺之間長成了一個少女，快將變為成人了。古人講「父母之年不可不知也；一則以喜，一則以懼。」我現在反行了古人的話，在送你出黃金時工的時候，也覺得悲喜交集。</p>
<p>所喜者，近年來你的態度行為的變化，都是我將由孩子變成成人的表示。我的辛苦和我母親的劬勞似乎有了成績，私心慶慰。所悲者，你的黃金時代快要度盡，現實漸漸暴露，你將停止你的美麗的夢，而開始的生活的奮鬥了。同時在我們，仿佛喪失了一個從少偎傍在身邊的孩子，而另得了一個新交的朋友。「樂莫樂於新相知」：然而舊日天真爛漫的阿賓，從此永遠不得再見了？</p>
<p>記得去春有一天，我拉了你的手在路上走。落花的風把一陣柳絮吹在你的頭發上，臉孔上和嘴唇上，使你好像冒了雪，生了白鬍鬚。我笑著　住了你的肩，用手帕為你拂拭。你也笑著，仰起了頭衣在我的身旁。這在我們原是極尋常的事情：以前每天你吃過飯，是我給你洗臉的。然而路上的人向我們注視，到我們羁笑。其意思仿佛在說：「這樣大的姑娘兒，」　在路上教父親摟住了拭臉孔！我忽然看見你的身體似乎高大了，完全發育了，已由中性似的孩子變成十足的女性了。我忽然覺得，我與你之間似乎築起一堵很高、很堅、很厚的無形的牆。你在我的懷抱中長起來，在我的提携中大起來：但從今以後，我和你將永遠分居於兩個世輥了。一刹那我心中感到深痛的悲哀。我怪怨你何不永遠定要長大起來，我做一個孩子而定要長大起來，我怪怨人類中何必有男女之分。然而怪怨之後立刻破悲為笑。我們的阿賓已將長成一個大姑娘了，不是一件可喜的事麼？</p>
<p>記得有一天，我從上海回來。你們兄弟姊妹照例擁在我身旁，等候我從　箱中取出「好東西」來分。我欣然地取出一束巧格力來，分給你們每人一包。你的弟妹們到手了這五色金銀的巧格力，照例歡喜得大鬧一場，雀躍地拿去賞新了。你受持了這贈品也表示歡喜，跟著弟妹們去了。然而過了幾天，我偶然在樓窗中望下來，看見花台旁邊，你拿著一包新開的巧格力，正在分給弟妹二人。他們自自爭多嫌少，你忙著為他們均分。在一块缺角的巧格力上添了一張五色金銀的包紙派給小妹妹了，方才三面公平。他們歡喜地吃糖了，你也歡喜地看他們吃。這使我覺得驚奇。吃巧格力，向來是我家兒童們的一大樂事。因為鄉村裏只有箬葉包的糖　餅，草紙包的狀元糕，沒有這種五色金銀的糖果；只有甜煞的粽子糖，　煞的監青果，沒有這種異香異味的糖果。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c142">消閑 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 鳳子</p>
<p>農夫們最普通的消閑地方，是茶館。</p>
<p>鄉村的茶館非常簡陋，所以也無須化多少錢，只要有四五個銅板，就可以坐上半天了。而那地方實在適宜於互道心曲和打聽新聞。</p>
<p>我們的村子上有百多份人家，三兩　小店，茶館是沒有的。要互道心曲或打聽新聞，就得走三裏多路，這在勞農們並不希奇，他們壓根兒不知道世界上有汽車，電車，以及人拉人的黃包車。</p>
<p>我在年青的時候，也常到那些地方去坐坐，聽聽新聞。茶館裏來去的人我大都認得，唱新聞的呌做金昌，是一個瞎子。各鄉新發生的事情，只要十天以後，就可以在金昌的口裏詳詳細細的從頭聽到尾，有唱詞，有說白，也有插科。</p>
<p>這個瞎子常常給人們以歡笑，感叹，流淚。</p>
<p>我離開家鄉已經有十年了。而在這十年裏，我也曾經歡笑，感歎，流淚。不過大都感歎多過歡笑。每當悲憤的時候，竟沒有一點可以快意的插科，使我高興。因此我也常常想起金昌瞎子，他在悲劇裏知道插進笑話去，使大家不至於沉悶；而我是永遠沉悶的，我的悲劇裏從來不會有過歡笑的穿插。</p>
<p>也許是因為我要找尋歡笑吧！這番回家，我帶著一種訪舊的心情，重到那個茶館裏去。</p>
<p>門前還是那麼灰暗，破舊，一點也不能醒目：白底紅字的掛牌，經過風打雨蝕，那「得春茶館」的春字早已脫落。進得門來，　　上坐著個中年婦人，抱著孩子在哺乳。黑沉沉的屋子裏有著七八張方桌，坐著十來個人，或者閑談，或者打盹，或者擎著茶壺出神。但我卻一個也不認得。</p>
<p>我在靠左的一張桌子邊坐下了，一個十幾歲的孩子給我泡上一壺青茶。滿屋子的視線都向我射來。我呌住那個剛要回身的孩子，問：</p>
<p>「金昌瞎子幾點鍾來？」</p>
<p>「什麼金昌瞎子？」</p>
<p>「那個唱新聞的。」</p>
<p>「這兒沒有唱新聞的。」</p>
<p>我覺得沒有意思，不再問下去。但對面那個打盹的卻抬起頭來，對我望了望。</p>
<p>「好面熟！」</p>
<p>「真的，老伯伯貴姓？」</p>
<p>「我是賣豆腐的三寶，自少兒就沒有姓。」</p>
<p>我猛的記起來了，那個人正是每天早上沿村喊賣豆腐的三寶，頂會說話，我們都呌他三活頭，誰知……</p>
<p>「你先生是……」</p>
<p>「我是古塘村二房裏的××」</p>
<p>「呵！那裏還認得。怪不得，你剛才問起金昌瞎子，你是從少兒聽慣他唱新聞的。」</p>
<p>「是，就是因為從少兒聽慣，不知道現在為什麼不來了？」</p>
<p>「死了五六年了」。</p>
<p>我想問下去，然而終於沒有開口。</p>
<p>「現在那裏有從前熱鬧，人　管多，但生意卻清淡。」他說著回過頭去，「每天還做不到二千，是不是？阿生嫂！」</p>
<p>「是呀！昨晚上大毛爺說，要再這樣下去，我們得收場了。」　樓上那個婦人回答。</p>
<p>「鴻泰號今天已關了門。」那二個閑談的，忽然把喉嚨放高了，但接著又低下去，還叹著氣。</p>
<p>立刻，像傳染病似的，滿屋子都叹著氣。</p>
<p>「田上收不到半粒米，誰有閑錢賣東西」三寶說著搖了搖頭，又朝著我：「從前我們厭工作忙，想偷點閑兒，到這裏來喝杯茶；現在是竟天閑，那兒消去？茶是喝得連舌苔都厚了。」</p>
<p>「八十文，給賒一賒。」一個茶客跑出館去。</p>
<p>「付一半吧，五大叔！，我們……」　樓上的婦人說。</p>
<p>「今天沒帶錢。」那個人一溜烟走了。</p>
<p>「幾時會帶錢呢！」婦人咕嚕著。</p>
<p>三寶還是搖著頭。</p>
<p>有趣的揷科都給金昌帶走了，這裏剩下的，也是一出沒有歡笑的穿插的悲劇。</p>

<p>天籬等候著他們。長遠不見的娟子，不知已長得怎樣，想來一定標致得多了。一想到她的眼睛和嘴唇，他就全身沸騰，壓抑不住狂放的熱情。他從涼亭上可以看到娟子家裏的大門，他記得在年少無猜，那老太婆還不曾憎厭天籬的時候，他們不知曾在那個進出口的石階上跳躍過多少次。在村子後面的一個墳地裏，有她亡母的墳墓，每當春秋祭祀的日子，他們也不知會在那兒放過多少次爆竹，上過多少次香火。還有，更使他不能忘掉的，是那條在村左的石橋。他們那種一同伏在石欄杆上戲弄洗衣婦的情景，真是甜蜜得宛然如在目前！</p>
<p>時間很慢地過去，但他的心去跳躍得那麼的快。他感到煩躁。有時他也偶然的看看涼亭牆壁上的「漫畫」和匾額上的小字，但大部分時間卻是眼瞪瞪地看著娟子的家。景色是美的，風雨也是富於詩意的，可是這都不能打動天籬的心。他的心目中，只有娟子。他出神地凝視著，傾聽著，仿佛他能隱約地聽到娟子的笑聲。</p>
<p>四周沉默著，沒有一點兒動靜。嶺腰有幾顆松樹，卻也聽不見什麼聲音，只看見他們給風吹得搖搖擺擺的。一眼望去只是灰白色的雲和霧。有時也有幾個人忽忽地走過，可是那急促的「鞏音」一消失，「空谷」似乎尤其空虛而且冷清了。</p>
<p>雨淒其地，不斷地下着。</p>

<h3 id="c144">暹教部發荒謬聲明書　旅暹僑胞據理駁覆　干涉華僑敎育殊違國際慣例　藉詞封閉華校舉措尤屬狂妄 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>暹羅敎育部長柏山沙拉巴華氏自發表其荒謬絕倫之取絲華校聲明書後、旅暹華僑及我國朝野人士、莫不憤慨異常、旅暹僑胞敎育界、特於日前根據理由、逐條駁覆、以促暹羅齊當局之覺悟、實業社記者茲探得該駁複書原文錄之於次、</p>
<p>迫人暹校　違國際法</p>
<p>（一）查獨立國對於本國敎育、雖有共自主權、但國際慣例對於外國僑民在不違背其居留地法律之內、其僑民均享有敎育自由權、並得在居留地設立學校、專授其子女以祖國語言文字及公民常識、例如中國在歐美日本以至南洋各島、皆設有華橋小學、教授皆用中國文字、語言固無論實、即其課程編制、悉照中國國情之需要、實施多年、未聞任何居留地政府在強迫敎育法施行內、而必強迫華童入該國所設立之學校者、即就中國而論、雖年來進行收回敎育權、亦僅屬於外國教育與中國敎育合辦專校華童之校、外僑自設以授其僑民者、固未便幹涉、今主權之範圍、實有藐視國際慣例也、（二）暹國佛歷二四六一年民立學校條例、及二四六四年強迫敎育條例、僅係對邊羅國人民所設之學校而發、對於華僑、並無明文規定、此於國際慣例亦有未合也、</p>
<p>禁授黨義　何能寬待</p>
<p>（三）華校與暹校既有分別、則暹羅政府當不能一律看待、強予措施、故前貴所許辦法、時加干涉、與華校設立之本旨相差尚遠、憑能認為對華校給予特權、（四）依上所述暹政府不應強迫華校一律受該項條例限制、已甚明顯、現在乃連華校所設之強迫班、亦一律取消之、何論於課程、竟何有所謂寬待、（五）查華校初中、僅有二三校、其餘概係小學、其課程、悉依照中國敎育部所頒定者、僅有公民常識、並無所謂政治之書籍、日華校為適應環境、專實亦兼授暹國語文史地、此種設施、對於暹國法律及治安上、應無妨礙、今暹政府竟有時在校中查得一二本三民主義之書、便藉詞　敎授政治主義課本、封閉學校、豈近情理、</p>
<p>華暹人民等待遇懸殊</p>
<p>（六）在華校方面、前進會體諒暹政府之意、暫時勉行、暹政府備之兩種民主敎育條例並聘請暹人爲校長、遵照課授暹文之重點、其因難窒礙已難以形容、乃今則以達背法令、封閉學校、至數十家、並決將華校應有之教育權、完全取消、殊屬狂妄、（七）上而所述華校設立目的、僅課授祖國語言文安生活技能及公民常識、所謂課授政治主義、既無事懝在暹人自辦之學校、兼授華文一科、亦僅能出入華橋學校之權利、至襄助華人無論新來或久居暹地者、享與暹人同等之待遇、則又未盡然、其出實如下、（甲）華人受移民律之限制、且須納居留稅、而暹人有否、（乙）華人出境、須納同領護照費、及限定時期回暹、暹人則否、（丙）暹國選舉法、暹人有選舉權、華人則否、（丁）最近頒佈之漁業條例、限令漁人領取執照、人數暹得百分之七十五、華人僅百分之二十五、其他關於工商業經營之不平等待遇、難以枚舉、若律以有義務、應有權利之常理、則不平等莫甚於此、</p>
<p>侮辱華僑　昭然若揭</p>
<p>（八）暹教育部既否認華校設立之權利、違反華橋教育子女之目的、乃要使華僑盡其不應書之義務、正如漁人驅使鸬鹚、捉魚套其頭之技倆耳、質言之、即視華僑已如奴隸、其藐視我國、侮辱我僑胞之昭然若揭、強詞飾非、豈能掩盡天下人之耳目、</p>

<p>幼良勇森雙建功</p>
<p>葡隊打成二比二後、頻思出奇制勝、柯拉沙法凡卻屢屢引兵深入、咄咄咄逼人、幸中華防御過密、得免於難、入底、許竟成送出一球、義臣腳下擺渡、鍾勇森自右角撲入中華、遂以五比　告捷、</p>

<h3 id="c171">白銀問題 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 潘明珊</p>
<p>美國白銀政策，以財部現存金額價値八十六億元，而存銀僅九憶一千五百萬元，須繼續購白銀十九億五千萬元，始符金三銀一之比率，如此大量白銀，超過目前世界所能供給的總額以上，影響所及，我國白銀外流，事非偶然。截至目前止，我國現存之白銀，爲十五萬萬元，影響於我國國民經濟，尤非淺鮮。政府有鑒及此，在不能宣佈禁止白銀出口情形之下，財政部於去年十月十五日下令征收白　出口稅及平衡稅，同月十九日復成立外滙平市委員會，但利之所在，人多趨之，私運漏稅出口，爲數頗巨，財政部乃又下令各省市緝私，以爲防止。並又免征白銀復出口稅，以鼓勵白銀回流，政府之治標政策上，自有相當之成效。</p>
<p>美財長　數次表示，美國將繼續購銀至價達一元二角九分，或至財部存銀達金三銀一之比率，目前美財部所定購買銀價仍爲每盎斯七角七分又百分之五十七，是美之白銀政策，邁進無已，斷不能因一二國之抗議而改變其已定之方針。考美之厲行白銀政策，收集世界現銀，不外乎世界不景氣潮流之激　，各國關稅，壁壘森嚴，國內則失業情形嚴重，工商凋敝，爲救濟本國不景氣及繁榮國內工商業起見，以銀價高漲，則用銀國如我國墨西哥等國，貨物成本增貴，勢難運美銷售，卽日本因購用中國原料，無形中成本亦加高，對美輸出，間接亦受影響，美國際貿易可以好轉，民間仰給外國貨者，勢將改用本國貨，反之，美本國貨物，成本减輕，輸出暢旺，美可坐收其利，而復興工商業計劃，乃得完成，此其一。世界形勢險惡，自德不顧凡爾賽條約擴張軍備，風雲日亟，有　觸卽發之勢，是第次世界大戰，無法倖免，將來優勝之誰屬，以資金雄厚者佔優勢，在第一次世界大戰中已有明證，美國大量儲存金銀，自具有遠大計劃，且戰爭時經濟上必發生拮据，而白銀則易於分配，周轉當勝於黃金，故不顧一切，提高銀價，貫澈其白銀政策，企圖執世界上經濟之牛耳。我人爲應付此號軍局面計，惟有自謀謀路，至，如可應付，則當先明瞭白銀政策對於我國之影饗，茲略述　槪如下：</p>
<p>（一）金融市塲　我國以銀爲本位幣，而國際銀市漲落靡定，我國貨幣幣值，亦隨之而有高下，銀價驟漲，則白銀外流，市面上籌碼缺乏，通貨緊，信用縮，利息增離，金融界對於工商放欵，取愼重態度，遂釀成工商界之不安，而金融市塲無從穩定，我國去年金融界之恐慌與夫今年四底前之危機，即其明證。</p>
<p>（二）國際貿易，自金本位國放棄金本位，减低幣値，已國貨幣對外匯價跌落，使輸入之外貨　貴，銷售不易，同時本國之輸出品，價格低落，出口减少，爲支付此國際貿易差額，巨額白銀外流，一方我國出口貿易，須以外國貨幣計算幣値之高低，若外國貨幣價値低落，我國對外滙價高漲，我國出口商，在我國所得之外國貨幣，因匯欵歸國，而受折價過低之損失，出口愈形衰落，是以白銀流出，以貿易入超爲條件，而貿易入超，則必造成白銀外流，兩者爲連鎖性之關孫，我國因歷年入超，坐使白銀外流，無法退止矣。</p>
<p>（三）中央財政中央財政收入，以關稅爲大宗，而關稅　依照金單位征牧，如銀價高漲，則金幣折合銀幣額，勢必大减，因吒對於內債之償付及軍政費之籌措，自必感受因難。且進口稅中從量稅僅受金銀折算上之損失，而從價稅則須受物價低落及折合之雙　損失，中央財政之損失實巨。</p>
<p>（四）製造工業我國工業方在萌芽時代，經此打擊，不易立足，新興之橡膠火柴捲烟等工業，相率减工，甚至停工。而大規模之　絲業紡織業，則滿目凄凉，相率减產停工。昔日外商憑藉其雄厚之資本，我國廠商，已難抵抗，今白銀價漲，洋貨値賤，厲行傾銷，我國工業爲其摧毀，是在意中。</p>
<p>就應付方策方，自當從防止折銀外流，减少入超，提倡國貨，及促進生產四端着手進行。茲分述如左！</p>
<p>甲·防止白銀外流美購銀計劃，一再變本加厲，自每盎斯提高至七角七分五七之價格，並尙有繼續提高至一元二角九分之趨勢。據議會中白銀派有力分子之表示，彼等將再努力使銀價至元一角八分，果其企圖實現，世界金融市塲被其搗亂，將不堪設想。我國爲用銀國，自不能例外。白銀派爲完成其計劃，必繼續增高銀價，以便積極向外購銀，我國白銀，如水之就下，源源外流，實趨勢之使然。政府已有所防範，惟爲澈底防止白銀外流，應再由政府定價收買，本年一約間曾由中央中國交通三銀行拋出純金二萬餘條，向杳港購進現銀二千萬元，二月又由外匯平市委員會向倫敦市塲購進白銀三百萬元，此種購銀政策，如何邁進無已，當亦爲防止白銀外流之有效辦法。</p>
<p>乙·減少入超去年報關出口之白銀，共二憶六千萬元，其中百分之九十以上，係由洋商銀行流出，洋商銀行流出大量白銀，是爲支付歷年國際貿易之差額也。故求國際貿易之平衡，實爲防止白銀外流之最有效辦法。至如何求國際貿易平穩，减少入超，五月六日實業外交財政三部曾會商討論，以治本須維護國內工業，使生產堪以自給，並注竟其海外市塲，以廣銷路，並由各關係部會組織國際貿易委員會，研究辦法，是政府對於减少人超，其步廢已在積極進行中。至我國歷年入超，實由於外貨進口稅率過低，得以廉價傾銷，反之土貨出口减少，且以我國生產落後，未能滿足人民購買之欲望，因是外貨源源進口，有增無已，欲圖减少入超，應獎勵本國工業及减少出口稅。出口稅之减少，才政部正在擬具辦法，預備實施，不久即可實現。至獎勵本國工業，則對於外貨有可替代之國貨者，增加其進口稅率，抵制其進口，一方則實行傾銷稅，以防止外貨之傾銷，蔗幾有效也。</p>
<p>丙·提倡國貨農村破產，資金集中都市，巨額入超，大量白銀外流，究其極，不能吸用國貨實爲其厲階。數十年前入超之數，初不過數百萬，繼則數千萬，今則數萬萬元，如不亟謀　救，則我國　地大物博，國民經濟勢必崩潰，而趨終滅亡。或以我國入超，由來已久，而農村之破產，工商之凋敝，爲近數年來之病態，以爲兩者並無關係。殊不知前數年流出之資財，伊多在中國，成由於洋商銀行之貸欵，或由於外商之投資，故創傷猶得隱蔽，今則以美提高銀價，利之所在，白銀大量流出，所謂數年之積病，爆發於一旦。若能從早　倡國貨，减少漏巵，則農村何由破產，資金亦不爲集中都　，即集中都市，亦不至流於海外。我國以農立國，年洋米輸入，竟成爲進口貨中之大宗。他若洋布疋頭，深入農村，土布銷路呆滯，我國徒爲米洋布推銷之尾閭。此種現象，危險孰甚，爲挽救計，自當提倡國貨。　提倡國貨，政府倡之於上，人民奉行於下，何至今仍鮮成效，要言之，在不能　之有恒。我人惟有决心持久拒用外貨，不以進口貨賤而大量購買，外貨中有國貨可替代者。則設法謀其技術上之改良，　量推銷，其無替代品者，則由專家悉心研究，以謀倣造，埋頸苦幹，積以時日，則國貨之某礎固，更何由銀漲價賤而傾銷哉。　丁·促進生產發展一國之經濟，須先增高其國民購買力，美之白銀政策，亦以提高　東購買力爲口號，故對銀漲之治本方法，在確實增加我國人民之購買力，其法在促進生產。至促進生產，則（一）復興農村，我國國民百分之八十爲農民，歷年進口外貨，又爲農業之原料品，若米麥棉布竟占多數，目前集中都市之資金，應散布於農村，使其復興，即所以增加其購買力，而促進國貨廠商之發展，（一）開發交通，以利國產之推銷，調劑其盈虛，年來公路發展甚速，使貨物暢行無阻，物價自趨安定，而促進工業之發展，間接即所以杜白銀之外流也。</p>
<h3 id="c172">美國將提高銀價至若何程度 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>這兩年來美國在貨幣政策方面最努力的，恐怕是提高銀價這回事了。顯然地，提高銀價的動機，是有經濟的政治的作用，雖然在　義上，未免太對不起中國和南美諸國的地方，使他們痛苦深刻化。「不過美國將提高銀價到什麼程度？」誰都關心到這個問題呢，本文就想籌，個解答，縱使不是一個絕對正確的，—也許不會成爲徒勞無功的嘗試吧！</p>
<p>「前事不忘，後事之師，」讓我們回頭來看肴美國提高銀價的歷史。提高銀價的開端，是農業救濟法案裏的Thomas　Amendment。那裏面規定美國得收受白銀作爲戰債的償還，可是數額以二萬萬美元爲限，每盎斯作爲美元五角計算。歐洲各債務國，本來產銀很少，存銀紫也十分有限，所以美國雖有這種許可，而實踐上却沒有多大效力。其次是倫敦白銀恊定，其中有一項規定，美國每年應　進白銀二千四百四十萬盎斯，對於收買價格却沒有規定（恊定的本意是叫美國按照當時市價收買，沒有叫他高抬價格收買）。美國在同年（一九三三十二月二十一日議院通過該案時，决定購銀價格爲每盎斯六角四分二厘五毫。從這時起，銀價便逐漸提高。後來一九三四年六月十九日的購銀法案裏，則規定財部擁有的黃金和白銀應構成七五％與二五％的比例。那時如果以五角一盎斯計算（因爲當時市價並未漲至六角四分二厘五毫），那麼美國尙應購入十三萬萬盎斯。接着是八月九日的白銀國有法案，規定以五角零一毫收買國內白銀。在這兩種措施下，銀價狂漲；我國白銀流出，亦以這時最爲激烈。</p>
<p>上述許多步驟，在白宮當局已經費了九牛二虎之力之能推行。然而白銀價格的提高，在白銀派的議員看來，還像蝸牛走路。太過和迂緩了。所以畢德門·韋勒·湯穆士·懷德諸氏，時常發表言論，抨擊政府，說「購買白銀未能盡職」，直至去年年底，美國如果要把白銀數量增加到和黃金構成二五％與七五％的比例，還得購進十一萬萬盎斯，假定每年銀產額平均爲一千八百萬盎斯（根據Edward　Kann的佔說，見Finance　and　Commerce　I　May,　1935），又假定其他供給俱爲工業工　所吸收，那麼　國要花七年工夫才能够把這事辦妥。代表辦業主利益的白銀派議員的非難，倒也是很近乎　情的。叫他們眼巴巴等七個年頭—不是七個月呀！更足使人寒心的，明年又是總統改選的時期，誰也不敢擔保「佛蘭克林」連任下去。在野的前任胡佛總統，又常常在那裏發牢騷，宣言美國最好還是恢復金本位。一旦胡氏冉登臺，七年長期購銀計劃不是要翻案了嗎？一元二角九分一厘九毫的價格，不曉得有沒有實現的一天。於是銀派議員多方努力，要求政府對白銀政策的態度强硬些，而政府迫不得　於一九三五年四月十日把購銀價格提高到七角一分一厘一毫，同月二十四日又提高到七角七分五厘七毫，一時世界銀市，受其掀動，墨西哥秘魯政府先後禁銀出口，中國所受的痛苦更深，毋庸多說。據說在最近的將來（明天或者後天也說不定），購銀價格還要提高，這是很可能的。美國老早便安排好提高購銀價格的程序，而提高的單位是百分之五，試觀左表：</p>
<p>鑄造利益　購銀價格（單位爲分）</p>
<p>四五％　七七·一一</p>
<p>四〇％　七七·五七</p>
<p>三五％　八四·〇三</p>
<p>三〇％　九〇·五〇</p>
<p>二五％　九六·九六</p>
<p>二〇％　一〇三·四三</p>
<p>十五％　一一六·三六</p>
<p>五％　一二二·八二</p>
<p>〇　一二九·二九</p>
<p>這種逐漸减低鑄造利益（Seiiorage　Prolit）即提　銀價的稈序，已經實施到第二步了，其餘的步驟，遲早也總要見諸實行的。現在成爲爭辯的焦點的是：一步步按照原有計劃逐漸提高呢，抑或一舉而抬高至一元二角九分二厘　毫？關於這一點，祗有他們白銀派議員肚皮裏才知道，筆者難不欲瞎猜。我們却可預測，如果銀價眞個提高到一元二角九分二厘九毫之後，賺錢不嫌多的鑛業主，一定還有更高價格的要求。據最近的電傳，有些議員竟主張銀價應提高至每盎斯二元一角八分。他們的理由是：「財部現有存銀，以每盎斯一元二角九分計算，約値十四萬萬五千萬美元。如照二元一角八分計算，則爲二十四萬萬五千萬元。至是則財部僅須收買價値四萬萬一千五百萬之白銀，即可成立三對一之比率矣。一—本月三日申報。這種提議，也有被通過的可能，因爲一則鑛業主用不着等待漫長的七個年頭，馬上可以享受二元一角八分的高價；在他方面，「兩個醉酒鬼靠攏來走路」的複本位——用W.　Kammerer的口吻——就可以降臨在沙姆大叔家裏了。這樣看來，白銀派議昌倒像黑旋風一樣性念，還不得白銀價格馬上提高至一元一角九分，又至　元一角八分，又至……。</p>
<p>可是我們不得不懷疑的是，這樣以人工的方法提高銀價，鑛業主和投機家自然可以獲得相當利益，對於整個美國國民經濟都不見得有多大裨益。正像美國某貨幣事家所說，白銀實際的價格祗有二角五分，過度的提高，終免不了發生反動而跌落。這幾天紐約倫敦孟買銀市的回跌，不是很好的例證嗎？銀價越提高，反動便越利害，徒然便宜了投機家，我們不明白銀派議員和白宮當局爲什麼要做這樣的笨伯？</p>
<p>並且美國黃金也一天天在增加，（這是國爲FaVoable　Balance　of　Trade）和債務債還等關係），白銀很難趕得上他。二月底財部擁有的黃金，是七，五九三，七二一，〇〇〇美元，三月中旬又增至七，六〇〇，〇一〇，〇〇〇美元，三月底更增至七，六五四，〇三四，〇〇〇美元（根據Federal　Reserve　Bulletin,　Apr.　1935）。更據五月九日申報華盛頓電：「五月六日美國財部黃金竟增至八，七二五，三一三，七八八美金，而存銀祇有一，五〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元」。說不定美國因爲白銀增加太慢，而把他的價格提高到三元左右——這也是很可能的呀！</p>
<p>白銀價再度狂漲的威脅下，最吃虧的是中國，其次是墨西哥秘魯。墨西哥政府在上月月底已實施新幣制政策，禁止銀幣出口，並以紙幣代替各種銀幣。而且所有銀行皆已奉令停止營業一星期。他方面又將現銀牧歸國有，並將按索對美金的滙兌率，制定以三元五角合美金一元的新價格。墨西哥當軸者辦事手腕的靈活，真是値得佩服。關於秘魯情形，則五月五日上海每日新聞有這樣的記載：「秘魯政府本月爲防止銀幣之鎔鑄而禁止輸出故，政府已命令將國內產銀收歸國有，並採取白銀輸出准許制度（Export　licience　System）」云云。那麼看來，蕞爾小國在對付貨幣戰爭方面也是不甘落人後也。</p>
<p>我們中國呢？本來有着一個很好的武器一　平衡稅，然而並不能好好地利用，這幾天倫教銀價和上海銀價的差額約爲百分之三十六左右，然而平衡稅老是懶洋洋不動——六·七五％！短視的金融家理論家，以爲這除了外匯放長外，白銀輸出巳經沒有可能性了。上月十六日的中外銀行間的一紳士協定」，實在因爲外商銀行存銀空處，落得　弄風情，老實說，在上物暫時是不會有什麼變故的，而同時五月七日上海每日新聞也說。。「經朝鮮鐵道而從東三省流出銀，過去一週間共達三五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元之鉅，近H僞政府亦採用護照制度矣」。可以說是完金受美國這次提高銀價的賜予。這樣因循苟目下去，總不是辦法呵！</p>

<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>我國素以產絲聞名於世，惜無改進之圖，數十年來，製絲器械，仍然墨守舊法，以致此唯一足以抵　巨額入超之輸出品，盡被日人所奪，而爲絲經大用戶美國所擯棄，非一可痛事乎？乃者，此大夢初醒，努力復興，亡羊袖牢，要亦未晚；然際此國際產業經濟，競爭愈演愈烈，前途仍覺不寒而慄。去年美國生絲消用，已見增加，在表面上看來，東方產絲各國，似有復蘇之望，惟細察內容，容或未許樂觀也。</p>
<p>一九三四年美國生絲消用統計（單位句）</p>
<p>日絲　歐絲　華絲　共計</p>
<p>一月　三九、二九六　三三〇　一、三一六　四〇、九四二</p>

<p>總計　四四六、〇〇四　五、三八六　一〇、三一六　四六一、七〇六</p>
<p>依上列統計，美國生絲消用，已在進展之途，蓋以前年十二月份而論，條用二六，九五九包，去年消數實已增加不少；惟紐約絲價，常盤旋於美金一元餘至二角之間，直至十一月中旬，始呈一度高漲，繼用又疲，迄今仍在一元二角之關，此中啞謎盡在美日絲商力手，不難考得其詳。查美國去年度消用生絲，何以漸呈轉機之勢，雖以生絲商人，化費巨量金錢使用種種宣傳，表演純絲製品之特點，以及購買眞絲成品之如何經濟，喚起民衆注意，銷路以之暢達，而價廉亦爲原因之一。但其主要點仍爲人造絲生產忽而减少之故也。一九三四年全美人造絲產量計一九〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅，三三年爲二〇七，五八〇，〇〇〇磅，相差計减少一七，五八〇，〇〇〇磅；以之折合生絲約占十三萬餘包之多。美國絲織物銷路，可稱與日俱增，設無人造絲之當前大敵，生絲製造，正可無量發展也。考等國人造絲之何以短產，旣非原料不足，又無其他重要阻碍，然則其理安在：蓋近世商業競爭，各有甚巧妙　腕，人造絲商豈甘坐視生絲商對己之不利行爲而無動於中乎？科舉昌明之技術人才已代其資本家設置新式機械，俾其出品進步，成本减輕，且有人發明木漿原料，可省去百分之五十之原本云云。是以美國將來之能否繼續消納巨量生絲，尙有研究之價値也。</p>
<p>日絲以秋繭收成减折，橫濱人氣看漲，如在上年之前，去年日絲自可一帆風順，得滿意之償；茲以人造絲關係，不得不聽命於紐約市塲之趨向，未敢高抬其値，眞不愧爲世界商塲中善觀風色之士也。</p>
<p>日繭以絲　低廉，一般農民，莫不叫苦連天，雖受政府種種補助，仍屬無濟於事；去歲育蠶者之總收入爲日金一九七，二九〇，〇〇〇元，較前年度僅及三分之一，且爲農民從事育蠶以來一十年中最低收益之新紀錄。</p>
<p>美國消用日絲，占其全數百分之九十六，六，而日絲生產還是過剩，故世界各用絲國，莫不有其傾銷踪跡，即生產落後之印度與澳州，今亦已具成功而仲入彼方市塲矣。茲將其去年出口數量列表如下，以資參考：</p>
<p>一九三四年日絲出口數量統計</p>
<p>單位包數　價值（日元）</p>
<p>輸美　四三三、　三七　二四四、三七九、三六五</p>

<p>輸印　四、〇六六　一、七八九、〇三三</p>
<p>輸其他　八、九四三　六、〇五四、五三一</p>
<p>總計　五〇五、九九八　二八六、七九三、八七五</p>
<p>去年日絲售價，低廉非常，　濱市塲最高（以B格標準）爲二月中之六七五元，最低爲九月之四三七·五元；較前年最高一〇九〇，最低五二〇元，相去差値，實屬可驚，幸其對美滙兌，受政府統制之惠，常在二八·三至二八·五五之間，故其製絲事業，雖在非常困難之中，未生特殊影響，亦不幸中之好現象也。</p>
<p>日商於希望絲價高漲，始於去年十二月初，惟至今未能如其所願，然亦夫嘗忘情於此，故春來三個月中，美方每月消用統扯有四萬四千餘包，而日絲每月運美、僅僅三萬餘包，可知日人之意欲使紐約存貨减少，並以國內供給不足之空氣爲烟幕彈，俾償其渴望之宿願，亦近日海外市塲驟然活動之由來也。</p>

<p>是三年前的暮春，當我嚼着第一顆紅了的櫻桃的時候，母親病重的消息，也在這時帶了過來，但當我趕回家裏的時候，母親已靜靜地躺在木板上；除了伊最後的一顆晶瑩的淚珠，還掛在伊凹進去的眼腔裏，好像替代了安慰外：我再不能　到伊「振兒，回來了，肚子餓麼？」的一聲。</p>
<p>母親，確是一位賢母典型的女人，伊有精明強幹的毅力；在伊的瘦小的臉上，永遠地表現着一付慈愛的神精，雖然我們幼時父親爲了姨太太而丟棄了我們，但母親依舊十和諧地撫育着我們，更不使我們脆弱的無邪的童稚時代，蒙上一些悲悲哀的情調。</p>
<p>我還記得很淸楚，在每個晚上臨睡的時候，我們總是摔着母親的衣裙，要伊講一段古代孝子或英雄的軼事，當然伊是從沒有拒却過的，而且是這樣的打起精神來講着，使我們忘了一切的痛苦和疲勞。</p>
<p>有時姊姊和我，也會在母親悲壯的歌聲裏睡去，無疑的，這種勉強的歡笑中，是蘊藏着無數的淚珠。</p>
<p>「流水容易把人拋「又到了送春的季節，當市上第一顆的櫻桃，映進我的眼簾，我又想起了我唯一親愛的母親了：伊死了已三年了，在這短短的二年中，誰知你不長進的兒子，已被生活驅策成一付滿身創痛的殘骸呢？唉！母親啊！</p>

<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>「星移塲」是我們蘇州的一句俗語。夏天光的淸夜裏，納凉庭除，抬頭看銀河皎潔，繁星點點，有的簇聚在一處，有的散居在四方，光芒燭燭，煞是好看，忽兒會有一條線似的亮光，閃電般飛奔過去。定睛細看，原來一顆星之動移了位置。古老相傳，這就所謂的「星移塲一了。</p>
<p>如今我所談的並不是天上的「星移塲」，卻是海上明星影片公司遷移了廠址。　明星公司蒲石路的舊址，租期已滿，　欲遷地爲良，經多時的物色，纔　滬西楓林橋左近的斜徐路上找到了一處房地，恰與從前的市政府是比門而居，這裏有幽蒨的樹木，一碧的草萊，還建有高火洋房三座，佔地有三十多畝，計劃中的兩所攝影塲，正快要開始動工。</p>
<p>半個月之前，工役們早已就一卡車一卡車的把許多道具在搬移了。前天，雖則舉行了一個進屋揭幕典禮，可是，辦公廳還沒有搬勁。</p>
<p>進屋這天的下午，男女明星，全體職工，一共三百多人，坐了汽車排隊前進，抵達新公司的大門，十萬發的邊砲，高陞。劈劈拍拍，這響聲幾乎把耳鼓都要震聾，同人們進禮　參加典禮後，還巡視了一周，覺得此地要比舊址大上三倍哩，大家略進些茶點，就在溟烟四合中散歸。</p>

<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>山東曲阜，妃至聖先師孔子的鄉里。孔子是我國文學上的宗師，也就是發揚我國文化的至聖，他的鄉里，關於他在文化上的紀念古跡，自然是不可　數，所以到曲阜去的人，必定要去瞻仰此萬世文學宗師的遺跡，以廣見聞。自曲阜車站，到曲阜城，共有十八里的遙遠，這因了孔子的墳墓　孔林一，在離城三里，倘是車站過近，便得震動了一孔林一，這也是尊重先聖的表現，由曲阜車站，到城內「大成殿」孔廟听見的古跡，可以略記如下：</p>
<p>闕里…闕里是孔子在曲阜城內所居住的所在凡是讀過四書的人，都可以知道，是在現在孔廟門右邊的一條短巷，有一個木製的牌樓，橫在街中，上面寫着尺大的闕里兩字，使人一見，便可以知道已到孔子的故居了。</p>
<p>杏壇…孔子杏壇設教，弟子千人，，爲千古佳話，進了孔廟的門，先瞧見的便是杏壇，約有五六丈見方的大小，是一個似亭子般的房屋，不過　面空敞，沒有窗戶罷了，高也祇有尺餘，由石級而登，正中的頂上，有金色的杏壇直匾，壇中又豎了兩塊石碑，這個杏壇，相傳便是孔子授教之所。</p>
<p>孔子手植檜…是一枝孔子生時，親目手植的檜樹，可是如今，却只剩一段枯木，一個陳迹罷了。</p>
<p>大成殿…大成殿就是孔廟的正殿，亨祀孔子的大殿，殿外都是盤着龍的合抱石柱，十分莊跟，殿內正中，是孔子的塑像，有兩丈光景的高度，兩旁立着顏子，子思子，孟子，曾子四個塑像，便是配享的西聖，四聖的兩邊，又有子路，子貢等椒一弟子的塑像，都是金碧　煌，見了令人肅然起敬，殿的頂上。掛着歷代帝皇所賜的匾額。殿的高度，足有七八丈，看上面的匾。頭上戴的帽子，便得落地，可知殿的高度如何了。</p>
<p>孔奶奶殿…孔奶奶殿便是孔子夫人的享殿，切建　築和設備，都比較了大成殿爲次，只是殿外的石柱，也盤着金龍，殿內塑的，便是孔夫人的塑像。</p>
<p>聖跡殿…最後面的一殿，謂之聖跡殿，裏面藏着七十二幅名書岡，都是孔子的故事，自孔子生長，以致於死的一生事跡，”是著名的故事，都在裏面，看了之後，可以知道孔子的一生略歷，這神聖跡圖，在曲阜有整套的出售，除了聖跡圖七十二幅之外，還有孔子的石刻像一幅，也可以在曲　城內買到的。</p>
<p>張猛龍碑…寫北魏字的人，很多抱張猛龍碑作爲範本，這塊張猛龍碑的眞跡，也在孔廟之內，用硃漆的欄杆封住，每年有一個時期，由孔廟管理的人，開了封，命人將碑場下，售給外面，所以在曲　的張猛龍碑的碑帖，到處可以看到而買到，並不十分希罕。</p>
<p>以上所記的，不過是孔　古跡的　一而已，　餘如啓聖殿，供的是孔子五代祖先的神位，兩廊也供着七十二賢的神位，同了廟內到處　着兩二丈高的石碑，這都可以看見，惟有孔廟中的樂器，和祀孔所用的各物，在我國文化上也佔着十分重要的地位，却不在紀孔的時候，就難得看見了。</p>

<h3 id="c190">南京健康教育之現狀及應改良之處 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 云石</p>
<p>南京市教育是很發達。一般辦教育的人知道除了兒童的求智識發達以外，還更知道身體健全與教育是并重的。所以健康教育參加到兒童的生活裏去，影響兒童心身健全的將來的確是很有意思的。</p>
<p>市健康教育委員會的成立是担負學生身體健全的使命，這一種的工作是受社會歡迎，所以在南京初辦健康教育計二十一校，在三四年已經漸漸的增加到一百二十幾校，現在南京將一百十幾校有分做五區，其中有一區所謂學校衛生實騐處，以實騐方法來研究學校衛生工作，以便從速促進身體健康的使命。</p>
<p>現在南京受健康教育委員管理的有一百二十幾校，學生人數在三萬五千以上，所以工作爲分區的關係，按二十三年到二十四年的重新訂有新計劃。他的工作大概有以下五項：</p>
<p>（一）保健工作——新生健康檢查。缺點復查。缺　矯治。訓練衛生隊。整潔檢查等。</p>
<p>（二）環境衛生——視察，報告，改善二項。</p>
<p>（三）預備工作——種痘及疫苗試騐注射等。</p>
<p>（四）治療工作——診輕病及轉送傳染病。</p>
<p>（五）特殊工作——如學校衛生講習班，學生家庭聯絡，學生家庭衛生改良等（此等工作多在寒假或署假）</p>
<p>以上五項工作和時期大概都照衛生署規定的學校學生實施方案而行醫師工作概况：健康教育委員會主任是衛生署學校衛生系直轄的他的工作多數在乎行政方面。其餘的醫師大概是做健康檢查工作　治療疾病等。</p>
<p>學校衛生護士工作：每週有輪流的到學校去做缺點矯治　如砂眼皮膚病等），衛生演講，保健工作種痘檢察學生整潔問題，以及改良環境衛生。</p>
<p>學生活動：晨問整潔檢查，協助矯治缺點，急救工作等。</p>
<p>行政方面：</p>
<p>市政府　健康教育委員會（社會局）　衛生事務所　教育局　學校區　學校</p>
<p>經濟來源：</p>
<p>衛生事務所計七二〇〇元市政府計四二〇〇元學校衛生費計八六〇〇元元每人四角</p>
<p>設備方面：</p>
<p>現在南京的學校普通都有衛生室，可惜有的學校爲了房屋不多總算也有一只藥櫃，藥櫃很簡單，內中所藏的就是一些急救和消毒藥品。牆壁上懸的是衛生署出版的教育畫圖，有時也有幾張教育相片。其次就是各種的記錄。</p>
<p>以上的幾種大略是南京市學校衛生的現狀。</p>
<p>下面就是我所希望改良的兩點：</p>
<p>（一）就是勻均分配經濟勻均分配經濟是一件最緊要的事。我見現在南京的健康教育分配經濟太不平均。就是照實施方案所規定一項來看，例如旅費一項最多不得超出百分之十的，現在健康教育已經超出到百分之二十，按上面經濟來源計，健康教育委員會每年收入二萬元，在二十四年新計劃預備三千二百七十元作旅費。而且這一項欵多用護士方面，護士旅行時間一多工作的時間就除少，所以我個人是希望增加護士而除去旅費的交替方法；爲什麼呢？假使健康教育會請了六個護士也不過二千八百八十元（每人每月四十元計）其餘的四百元就做醫師的旅費：我想這樣一來將她們工作範　縮少了，同時人員加多，增長時間就可以增加工作效率。所以總覺得這樣的比較好些。</p>
<p>（二）與學校合作問題：南京的學校與健康教育會作合這是一件最緊要的問題。我希望這一件事能不至使學校與健康教育會有困難，雖然有時候因爲健康教育會工作分配不過來往往一個學校連一星期沒有一次缺點矯治或作其他工作，有時確是，能使學校悔心而引起到不合的問題。所以我個人是歡喜多用授課的方法，與校長學生接近，因爲有了多接近的，自然能夠有合作的機會。所以有許多人以爲這種主張是難的，其實兩個學校只出四十一元省去了兩種衛生教育費；實在還是值得的。就是將勻均分配經濟費對於合作問題都有很大關係的。</p>
<p>我對於改良的計劃略略只寫出這幾點，我希望研究學校衛生先生們指正。</p>

<p>日本之學校口腔衛生</p>
<p>日本自明治維新以來，科學振興，百業與日齊進，齒科醫學之發達，不但可稱東亞之冠，而比於歐美，亦未多讓。故對於口腔衛生運動，亦特加注意，尤以海陸軍之口腔衛生，比歐美各國更爲先進。在日俄戰役之際，已有齒科軍醫之委任。至於學校齒科，在明治三十五年，東京市麴町區，已委任齒科醫四名施行小學兒童之口腔診究，此可謂最先着鞭者矣。</p>
<p>至大正二年，學校口腔衛生運勁，更爲勃發。翌年二六新聞社開通俗衛生博覽會於東京上野不忍池畔，關於齒科應用之出品，亦極爲豐富，遂引起民衆之興趣。同年四月於東京府之第三高等女學校內，創辦學校齒科治療所，此殆爲東京市內中等學校有齒科治療所之　矢也。</p>
<p>大正九年，該校之治療所設備，更爲完善，並大加刷新，至今尚甚活動，此恐爲東京市學校齒科治療所之最有歷史者也。</p>
<p>大正六年四月，廣島市由市當局委任齒科醫六名，爲市內之學童口腔診　。七年六月大阪市齒科醫師會，以救護貧民爲目的，發行特別診療券，以惠貧民。當年八月Lion夏季“腔衛生講習會，招集全國各地學校教城員約二百餘名，開第一次集會於東京，以作口腔衛生宣傳，此後每年繼續進行。至八年三月，提出「關於小學兒童口腔衛生」之議案於議會，得政府委員贊成通過九年四月日本聯合齒科醫師會，開口腔衛生演講會，以作宣傳。十月內務省開兒童衛生展覽會於教育博物館，乘此機會，乃舉行「　齒豫防日」，以喚起民衆對於口腔衛生之注意。十年五月，東京有志之士，創立口腔衛生研究會。八月設立本鄉區齒科校醫會。九月小林氏開設見童齒科醫院。而其他如千葉岡山大阪等各市，對於學校齒科衛生運勁，亦十分熱烈。由此可知其時之對於兒童口腔衛生之如何注重矣。</p>
<p>大正十二年，日本聯合齒科醫師會，刊行口腔衛生資料」二卷。（第一卷遠藤氏第二卷川上氏執筆）自此年起，東京市內小學校，勵行齒科診查，甚爲發展。當年九月，遭遇關東大地震，齒科醫師團體，舊不顧身，糾　齒科救護班，爲社會　效。十一月Lion會社及俱樂部會社，組織巡廻齒科診療班，開始爲市內各小學兒童診療。</p>
<p>大正十四年三月，靑森縣開全國之先聲，由縣訓令頒布委任學校齒科醫之規定。其後各縣亦頒布規定。至昭和四年，二府二十五縣，俱依縣令之規定，逐成極有組織之口腔衛生運動。各縣均有學校齒科醫會之設立，學校齒科治療所之數，亦與年增加，以東京市一隅計，約有五十餘所，全國幾達二百有餘¥但其中市立者較少，祇有金澤小樽函館旭川數市而已。</p>
<p>昭和三年以來，日本齒科翳師會，得內務省及文部省之後援，規定每年六月四日，爲「　齒豫防日，每逢此日，全國踴躍，以學校學生工塲軍隊爲中心，大施宣傳，舉國同聲，施行定期的口腔衛生運動，世界各國，恐未有可與倫比者也。</p>

<p>神經痛　Neuralgia</p>
<p>神經痛是一種痛，由於腦綫受激刺或腦綫發炎。最常有的神經痛是面部的三叉腦綫，其次爲頭後下部與頸相接處的神經，肋骨間的神經，頸旁下部的神經，大腿上骨節與大腿後部的經。</p>
<p>面部三叉神經痛三叉神經是大腦內發出的第五對腦綫。這一對腦綫每一綫分爲三大分綫。第一分綫分布在眼之上部，額部直達頭皮頂。若是這一部分腦綫受激刺這一部分就要痛。第二分腦綫分布在上頜骨及面之前部鼻之旁邊。這一分腦綫受了激刺這一部分就要痛。第三分腦綫分布在下頜骨與頦部及面之旁。這一部分腦綫受激刺這一帶也要痛</p>
<p>三叉神經痛有以下幾種原因：（一）梅毒第三期（不是每一梅毒第三期就有三叉神經）。（二）瘧疾。（三）貧血。（四）慢性中毒，如糖尿症，痛風病，鉛中毒，飲酒過度習慣。（五）操勞過度。（六）婦女哺嬰太久。（七）腦綫受激刺，如　牙，倒長大牙，　內腔發炎。有止以上任何一種原因另外受寒，或忽易大氣壓力（如升高降低），或神經受激刺，或過於疲倦，或稍激刺腦綫分布的部分如嚼食物，談笑，欠伸，刷牙，洗臉等等，神經病就很容易一觸卽發，或一觸舊痛復發。</p>
<p>痛發作是一陣一陣的痛，並且疼痛也是非常厲害。病者常形容這種痛如刀刺，刀割，引裂，火燒一樣。每次發作要一陣一陣的痛好多回。發作的時間有　數分鐘，或數小時，或數日不等。痛過後病者恢復常態。這種毛病歷時越久痛的回數越多，痛也越烈。</p>
<p>治療這種痛以去掉病原爲上策。例如，治療老梅毒，治好鼻腔炎，爛牙，拔去倒長的末了大牙就很可以除根。</p>
<p>痛來時治標的辦法大約如下，內服止痛藥類如阿西坦尼利，安替排林，斐那昔汀，或同類藥有相目的價值。注意這些藥不能服太久，因太久效騐漸無並且還損壤身體。麻醉品勿嘗試因易成癮。水療法有很大的益處。其次鎮靜神經藥也有些好處。</p>
<p>骨節痛</p>
<p>骨節痛是一種複雜的毛病。有的是急性發炎痛，有的妃慢性發炎痛。慢性的多是逐年累月　綿。我國人有了這種毛病大多數祇知道在痛處貼膏藥，至於痛的原因完全不問。若是我們曉得了骨節痛的原因就可看出貼膏藥沒有什麼特值別價，並且也不是治療的正當途徑。茲略述骨節痛的原因於下以供讀者參考：急性的竹節炎大概的原因爲：（一）風濕病，細菌滋生在心內膜　　進入血液後侵入骨節起致骨節炎。（二）白濁病（與婦女花柳性白帶），淋菌由血侵人骨節。（三）由肺炎菌發炎。（四）骨節內生膿。（五）隨急性傳染病而來的，如，星紅熱骨節炎，心臟　膜炎骨節炎，傷寒症骨節炎，痢疾　節炎等（未完）</p>

<p>（四十七）急性中耳炎</p>
<p>急性中耳炎大都發生於急性熱性傳染病（譬如麻疹，猩紅熱，實扶的里，腸梯扶斯，流行性感冒，百日咳，痘瘡，肺炎，丹毒等等）及鼻腔，副鼻腔，鼻咽腔等等的急性炎症或慢性炎症。再者游泳，鼻腔洗滌，鼻內手術，鼓膜投傷等等。有時亦可引起急性中耳炎。釀成急性中耳炎的細菌。最多的，是連鎖狀球菌，肺炎球菌及葡萄狀球菌。有時爲綠膿菌，大腸菌，實扶的里菌，流行性感冒菌，腸梯扶斯菌及結核菌等。她最易感染的徑路。就是由歐氏管所侵入。臨床上可分急性中耳炎爲二。一爲急性單純性中耳炎。一爲急性穿孔性中耳炎。這兩種的病情。雖然各有不同。但是她們的原因。則並無相異之處。我現在再將她們的病情。分述如左。</p>
<p>一·急性單純性中耳炎</p>
<p>急性單純性中耳炎的主要症候。就是耳內疼痛。她的痛性。如刺如裂。多爲間歇性。耳痛能在夜問，咳嗽，噴嚏，嚥下運動等時增劇。難聽亦爲必發的症狀。同時常感覺耳內充塞，頭痛，及搏動性耳鳴。發熱祇在小兒。較爲劇烈。常超攝氏四十度。有時發生嘔吐，眩暈，譫語，昏朦及痙　等等類似腦膜炎的症狀。有時發生顏面神經麻痺及味覺障碍。我們若用耳鏡來檢查鼓膜。則見鼓膜潮紅腫脹。</p>
<p>本症經過良好的時候。大概二三日後。耳痛卽可緩解。同時鼓室內蓄積的滲出液。亦卽漸次吸收。再經二週左右。鼓膜的潮紅腫脹。卽能消散。恢復常態。但是如若遇着治療不當，虛弱，貧血，腺病性，結核性，糖尿病，及慢性鼻咽腔疾病患者。則經過遷延。甚至變爲急性穿孔性中耳炎。或慢性中耳加答兒。或者繼發乳嘴突起內瀦膿症。有時竟可續發腦膜炎，腦膿瘍，膿毒症等。而取致命的結果。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第十一章　肺結核的合併症</p>
<p>第一節　結核性腦膜炎（績）</p>
<p>結核性腦膜炎一症是怎樣構成的呢？第一是由於血管系統方面的進襲，這在急性粟粒結核一型式裏面已提過了！由淋巴腺系統的進展也是可能的：像結核性中耳炎，就是一條好途徑。此外像頸腺扁桃腺方面是否可能，在現今還沒有决定。講到時期一方面；他是大半發生於初期集合以後的，在以後種種完成性型式是比較鮮見的：對於成人之鮮患本症，這也可算得一個旁證了！</p>
<p>在第九章裏面曾經說過：急性粟粒結核係有腦膜炎性一型式，并且脊椎液中也可以證明結核菌的；那末，讀者或許要問：究竟其間有沒有區別呢？抑是完全一樣的呢？這當然不能僅憑臨床上症象而言的。我們要曉得，急性粟粒結核是全身病，故又有全身粟粒結核之名：不像結核性腦膜炎是完全局部的病症，祇是臨床上症象有時會偏重局部罷了！其二：急性粟粒結核完全是由血管系統方面的進襲而成，結核性腦膜炎則並非一定的。其三；急性栗粒結核溫度極高；結核性則溫度上昇並不甚高，近四十度是狠鮮見的。這是隨便舉的例，至於是否爲一症兩名一層，我想讀者們决不會不明白的。</p>
<p>第二節　胸膜炎</p>
<p>胸膜炎症，根據他的發生原因，從前係有初發性和次發性兩種分別的。初發性是直接從本身發生。次發性是由於接近處之進襲。或由其他傳染性病灶經內部的移轉而成的。但據最近的研究。這一種分類法，是不很妥當的的：因爲初發性的胸膜炎大半是帶有結核原因的。在事實上告訴我們的，就是；凡會患過一次胸膜炎的人們，後來大半會發生結核症的。此外，在滲出性胸膜炎一症中，他的滲出液有百分之五十妃可發現結核菌的。就是結核的初期病灶以及浸潤，都可以和胸膜發生密切關係的。尤以滲出性胸膜炎一症，他差不多佔百分之九十五係帶結核性原因的，根據這種種事實，所謂初發性胸膜炎，幾乎是沒有這一會事：至於和結核症雙方焦不離　的情形，那更加是昭然若揭的了</p>
<p>爲什麼肺結核症發生胸膜炎如此之易呢？我們要曉得，胸膜內板是被覆肺面的，假如肺表面有了結核性浸潤狀態，那未，就可直按向胸膜侵襲的。這樣情形，不特結核症如此，就是肺炎肺壞疽肺膿瘍等症，也無不如此的：祗是沒有結核症那樣衆多罷了！</p>

<h3 id="c196">國聯討議救濟上海俄婦 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>國聯不單是個國際政治的組織，同時好像也是個國際的慈善機關。牠在解决國際間的糾紛之餘，有時也順便做一些慈善的事業。二十九日日內瓦路透電：國聯現復注意上海白俄僑民問題，據討論販賣婦孺事業委員會之報告稱，上海一萬俄婦中，年在十六至四十五之間者，佔七千二百人，其中有百分之二十二分半，以賣淫糊口·國聯現議設立特別職業訓練處·廉費食肆·及寄宿舍·以收容此輩無告之婦女云。</p>
<p>自蘇俄革命成功以後，共產主義國家成立·一班帝制時代遺留下來的白俄·因爲思想主義的差異，不願生存於紅軍領袖的統治之下，便被迫離開祖國，到世界各處去漂流，過着無國籍的生涯。尤其是婦女們，其境遇更覺悽苦堪憐。據國聯調查所得，漂流在上海的俄國婦女，就有一萬之多。她們這些無告的婦女，身居異地，既無家產，又無職業，其境况之日見惡劣，固在意中事。其中首分之二十二分半的靑年或者中年的婦女·爲這惡劣的生活所驅迫，便不得不犧牲肉體去賣淫，以爲糊口之計。這實在十分值得我們的同情。</p>
<p>可是是細一想，這班漂流在外國的白俄婦女，以前她們之中，有的在帝俄未被推倒以前，不是過着很優閒的生活，享盡人間的幸福。她們今日的悲慘的遭際，說不定就是她們往時的驕奢淫逸的結果。這話並非過言。然而這是往事。我們對於這班被接於祖國，而漂流在異地的白俄婦女，過着流浪生活，的確值得人們的同情。故我們以爲現時國聯能注意到上海這一萬無告的俄國婦女，而想設法加以救濟，以甦其困，倒是一件非常使人滿意的事，其價值實不减於解决一個國際間的問題。</p>
<h3 id="c197">白姑娘及其他 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>一九三五年的開始，戲劇運動的空氣是相當濃厚的，但是到近來，這個熱鬧過一時的戲劇運動，又沉寂下去了，一直到現在，纔讓約翰劇社來破這個沉寂的空氣。</p>
<p>這次演出的戲，共是三個：「小偷」（獨幕劇），「白姑娘」（二幕劇）和「自由」（獨幕劇）；此外，還有些歌舞和國立音專的音樂。</p>
<p>我去的時候，因爲較遲了一些，所以南洋華僑參觀　的「歌舞」和獨幕劇「小偷」已做過了，所看到的便祇有「白姑娘　和「自由」這二個戲。現在，就讓我把這二個戲的觀戚，寫寄一些在下面：</p>
<p>「白姑娘」這劇本據說是歐陽予倩先生的作品，在上海還不曾演過，由應雲衛和唐納二位先生聯合導演。</p>
<p>「白姑娘裏是告訴我們些什麼來呢？說！有二個「小丑」，同時愛上了「白姑娘」，於是他們打賭，諸看不出誰的化裝，誰就　了「白姑娘」，讓那個贏的去「有情人終成眷屬」，但是結果呢，那個師兄雖然了，可是他瞧出了白姑娘愛她的師弟　在比愛他得多，於是他就　　　　的一　了之。</p>
<p>這是一個「喜劇」，是使人看了發笑的喜劇，但是，笑過之後，我們也就再找不出什麼更重大的意義來了，如果我們一定要找出他的意義來，那大概如說明書上所寫的那樣，　「在三角戀愛要打漩渦的人們」，去學學他那種「可欽可佩的精神」，免得「吃虧吃苦」。要是除此之外再想，找出意義來，那實在是找不到的。</p>
<p>在演出上，值得佩服的，是工作人員的認眞，努力，那種始終不懈，一絲不苟的精神，在演員方面，雖然是有過火的動作，或是不到的地方，但是那是舞台經騐缺乏的緣故，他們的那種認眞的，努力的精神我們還是可以瞧得出來的。</p>
<p>自由這個劇本的原作者是美國的約翰里特，由邱波先生譯成中文，刊在現代」的六卷第一期特大號上。但是很遺憾的，一直到現在，我還沒有讀過那個劇本。</p>
<p>戲是說有四個囚犯想越獄出去，這四個囚犯中，一個是冶鐵工人，一個是詩人，一個是「浪漫家」—說得更正確一些，我們不如說他是神經病患者來得好些吧—還有一個呢，是一個很有宗教信　的輕罪犯。</p>
<p>這四個囚犯，在打算越獄的時候，詩人的詩興大發了，他打算立刻寫一首歌頌自由的詩，輕囚犯因爲是年老了，或許是罪輕，或是給宗教所麻醉，所以半途上都不打算逃，而那個神經質的所謂「浪漫家」呢，當他發覺了費了三年工夫造成的銼刀和繩梯都沒有用處的時候，他也因爲太容易而不逃了，結果，祇有那個渴望着自由的工人要逃出去，但是，他立刻就給那三位「紳士」拖住了，因爲他逃了之後是會遺害他們的？</p>
<p>以作者的原意，或許是向紳士們諷刺，他知道「吼着的是工人，想出去的也只有工人」但是，把監獄作爲背景，而又把這四個不同的人物寫在一起，這多少總不免有使人感到一種想入非非之感，你想，一個從事三年的舉動，難道事先都不會瞭解對手的性格嗎，怎樣會在事機到來的時候纔來一個突變呢。</p>
<p>就是在劇情的發展上，也使人感到有一種是太「理想」的。</p>
<p>美國的牢獄是怎樣的我是不知道，但是早些時候，看了「亡命者」之後給我的印象，好像覺得也和中國的不見得會有多大的區別。這樣，在本劇中，我就發生了幾個疑問：（一）現在的牢獄中，似乎不會再有媒油燈和自來火，尤其是自來火，據說爲了防止獄犯的自殺，是被禁止使用的。雖說這要是輕囚室。（二）囚犯的手槍打那兒來的？（三）那個鐵柵窓，何以會竟然沒梢的呢，既用不到繩梯抓墻，又沒有哨兵，難道眞的不怕囚犯們逃走？</p>
<p>所以，卽使作者的原意是很不差，但是在劇情的發展和事物上，終究不免太「理想」了一點。</p>
<p>演出方面，努力，認眞的精神　是值得我們佩服的，但是因爲戲的進展太平，高潮沒有力量，所以並不能怎樣的抓住觀衆的感情。</p>
<h3 id="c198">生的滋味 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>他亦由奇異激動出莫名的憤怒，既然那樣，自己是自己，叔叔是叔叔，還有什麼話頭，於是他突然長着很大的勇氣，睜着眼睛，瞧着叔叔，忿忿的說道：</p>
<p>「隨便，算是這樣完了，以後我永遠再也一步不踏進你的門檻。」</p>
<p>說着，他咬着牙關一直冲門走出來了。</p>
<p>途在裝着爹爹的驅殼的棺材身上邊約墨油漆也許　沒有　哩，可是週遭的環境已經迅速地崩潰了，連着如自家人，那麼親信的叔叔也成陌路。</p>
<p>每當想到了這，想起那天跑到叔叔家里的情况，叔叔一付鐵板的陰酷的臉孔便霍然地浮現在他眼底，怒火隨卽胄穿腦蓋，牙齒碰磨得索索作響，他晃着拳頭手，像要揪打誰似的。</p>
<p>接着他便：吸，儘瞧我不起眼，別臭得意、就是窮得討飯過日，也决不求倚你，等着瞧吧，終有一日。</p>
<p>那麼神經錯誤般呢　自語着。</p>
<p>於是娘輕聲地站在他面前是勉勵也是勸慰地安撫着兒子：</p>
<p>—用不着動這些閒氣的，人總是如此的，不靠仗人就算，自己好生做起來，拿點本事給人們看。</p>
<p>娘所說的也正是心想着的話。</p>
<p>但他老欲記住早些日子的家的一切緊榮的景象：那時的家，不論夜也論是日，整天里一淸早起，客人便流水似的進進出出了？每個來客大都對於主人有着不同的而是相同的期望，因此每張臉全是笑嘻嘻地，格外親切的嚕囌這那樣，這樣，嘴巴子是異常甜滑，如逢着爹爹不在家，或者還沒起床的時分，小主人的他便代替爹爹招呼客人，而所有的客人亦以着一般濃冽的興緻合着他談笑。一屋子里便那麼自早及晚不斷地嘈雜着融融的笑聲，可是客人　笑聲，如今去到什麼地方呢？</p>
<p>是跟着爹爹同時消滅了。</p>
<p>曾經有一個期間給許多人的手重重地輕輕地敲着的兩隻　環，現在再也聽不見絲微的聲息，閒得差點長起銹來，客呢，更頓然的寥寂起來，讓無邊的空漠鎖住着，冷淸有如一座古寺，每天除了他自己偶然從外邊回來有過一兩次零落的敲門聲，此外是沒有些兒動靜。</p>
<p>人們都遠遠離隔着他各自去了，以及，叔叔。</p>
<p>從那客人的門前經過，而又知道這家人的往事，你會深深撩起一種疏闊的記憶嘆息着；</p>
<p>「現在却太寂寞了！」</p>
<h3 id="c199">樓居小品 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 夏蔭</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>像一隻無窩的幼鳥，飛出自由間的故巢生活的威力無時無地都逼我陷於顚沛困苦的窘境，在一個落在時序後頭不遠的化雪的日子，生活的風暴又打碎了我的美夢；於是提起一個小小的行囊和一個風塵滿漬的心，一夜列車的飛奔，把我送到這一角小樓裏—依棲於友們的溫情下二而今又是落花的季節了。</p>
<p>溢揚在這周遭的氣息，永遠是這麼平和恬靜，像一口秋日的碧潭，長在滿足的微笑裏得意着自己生命的安恬。每當淸晨，一聲鶏呌，喚醒依稀的夢境，迎着朝旭的光影，天是一片澄淨，一切田疇，菜草如茵，柳林裏炊烟依稀，有着鳥雀的歡笑，竹籬上薔薇初綻、花　　　，這時候、照例臨　而坐，一從白金的筆尖下榨着一點點生活的來源，文思倦了，白水一杯，仰望朝旭已不知在什麼時侯凌空而上，壯麗勇邁：便會悠然神往，歡慶光明的偉大與到來，反省使我痛心於消沉的可怕，我會摔開水筆，舊然而起，伸開雙臂對朝陽呼喊着。</p>
<p>「我要有個光明的奮躍的前途！」</p>
<p>是的，這樓居生活已恬靜得成爲消沉了這樣生活下去，對於自己的年靑的生命徒然是一套無可救藥的浪費　要像高爾基在鷹之歌里所描寫的嚮往於光明，爲光明搏戰而至於死的鷹，這終是值得歌讚的戰士的行徑啊。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>又是落花的季節了。</p>
<p>時光的飛逝是不由人不惋情年華的老去的。</p>
<p>—花落水流紅閑愁萬種。這古詩人詞客的感傷的句子，雖然不會在自己的筆下滑出，然而當棚架上的玫瑰撤下，一片片變了紫色的花片，可也使我威數着這麼年靑的力屈蟄在一角小樓里，又寂寂地消失了一個春天了。中心的隱痛與焦悶可就足夠一夜的失眠。</p>
<p>—究竟期待着什麼呢？</p>
<p>杜鵑雖然啼不住將要歸去的春，明歲，春天可會再來的；而去了的年華是不會再回來的呀！</p>
<p>黃梅雨的氣息將是更沉悶悒窒的。這以後，也就是炎炎的夏日了。</p>

<h3 id="c200">生涯 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>生涯是一塊石，沉沉的有着千鈞重壓在肩頭；生涯又是一條崎嶇的窄路，無窮盡的伸展在脚下，除非汝咽下最後一口氣倒下去，這條無盡窮的窄道是永遠走不完的。本來，一個人的生命是這麼薄弱，在嗟咄之間以一種便當殘慘的方法來切斷一口氣也不是怎樣艱難的事。不過，上帝對於人類的聰明的賜予是很慳吝的；愚庸傻氣到底編織着大部分人羣的腦子，目前的生涯雖然沉重艱難，可還不能就輕易倒下去：卽使生命的魄力消竭到不能不倒下的最後一剎那，也是還要來一個廻光返照的掙扎對世界作無可奈何的怨悒的戀留的。這是人類的悲哀的極峯，也就是人類之生的切望的堅強秉賦了。</p>
<p>這種說法假使卽是人生的解釋，那麼侯阿旺這一個人就是用這種愚傻的腦子來負荷沉重艱難的生涯的可憐人。</p>
<p>侯阿旺一切都與常人無異，一樣要飯吃，要衣穿；只是人生得倭些，這似乎就因爲倭，所以一生只能微裁縫。他父親本是種田的，因爲不願兒子再吃這口苦活，當兒子十二歲那年就把來送到城裏一間裁縫店裏做學徒。父親對於兒子的希望是很大的。由徒弟變師傅，師傅做老板，那以後自己就可放下鋤頭，啣着旱烟袋坐在店堂裏享享福了。不幸，兒子出師那年，他老人家可先抱恨倒下了，丟下候阿旺就成了個無依無靠的畸零人。</p>
<p>那時候阿旺剛交二十歲，雖然八年學徙生活已把他的年靑的銳氣磨折淨盡，在人們面前老是露出一副腼腆卑微的形相，但未來的美夢可還潛織在心底里，時時鼓舞他，誘掖他，使他還能相信自己的年靑不難把前途造就好；他懂得侯家的香火要全靠自己來延續的，因此，在針頭綫堆裏，他埋下頭，沉默地期待前途的展開，蝸牛一般的在生活綫上爬。</p>
<p>無盡的歲月又閃電一般飛過去了，皺跡已無情地抹在他的眉尾額角，鼻樑上架了一副老花眼鏡，嘴上也多了兩撇寒酸的老鼠鬚，希望的幻滅使他變得更沉默，卑微尷尬，他已是一個四十五歲的人了。可是，也就在那年春間，也許桃花運降臨到他身上了，他經過了三夜的猶豫，纔無條件地收養起一個又啞吧又踢脚的有身孕的女人，希望的光芒又在他心裏閃動起來，他似乎變得活廢了些，他已有了一個妻了。</p>
<p>半年過去，這個啞吧妻子果然給他生下一個猴見樣的小東西來，那時他可眞算舐嘗到了人生的樂趣，當天虔虔誠誠的在祖堂上碰了九個嚮頭，眼淚可不知怎麼就流下來了。</p>
<p>可是，他的體力究竟不濟了，他的老式的裁剪已不再受人賞識，人們已漸漸把他丟到腦後。他找不到之故，肩頭的負荷可比先前增重，自己一張口外，還有兩張待哺的肚子，他一下子就給陷落在泥窖裏。</p>
<p>於是，在一個夜裏侯阿旺偷山芋」的新聞傳遍全村以後，人們總不會忘記在他背後鼻孔哼一聲，譏駡着。</p>
<p>——自家都沒本事養活，也想養老婆，生兒子？哼，早死早贏哩，活來受罪？</p>

The projects to be governed do not seek quantity, but universality, not seeking quick results, but perseverance.

<p>(Nanjing) The water of the Qinhuai River is increasingly foul, and citizens have repeatedly telegraphed to request dredging. Song Xishang, director of the Public Works Bureau, said that the municipal government is in the process of planning the dredging of the Qinhuai River.

This machine can be used for both draining and pumping water, both draining the sewage from the Qinhuai River and pumping it into the Yangtze River to regulate it. It is expected to be transported and installed in three months. In the current situation, we can only wait for the water level of the Yangtze River to rise slightly, open Xiguan, and allow the Yangtze River to flow in to clean the turbid waters of the Qinhuai River.

<h3 id="e30">Italian-Abyssinian Relations Intensify Again <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since Germany announced its rearmament, the European situation has suddenly become serious, causing Italy, which was actively preparing for war against Abyssinia, to slightly shift its attention to Europe. As a result, Italian-Abyssinian relations eased. However, in recent days, due to the results of the Stresa Conference and the establishment of the Franco-Russian agreement, the crisis in Europe has subsided somewhat. Thus, Italy's attitude toward Abyssinia has taken on a bold and decisive air. Italian authorities stated that the Italian government can no longer tolerate the situation in Abyssinia, that Abyssinia is not a country of the same race or religion, and that Italy has a need to clarify the overall situation in Abyssinia. At the same time, Mussolini ordered Italian troops to prepare for war. Judging from his intentions, he seems determined to launch a decisive attack on Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Historically, the countries with interests in Abyssinia have been the United States, France, and Italy. In the late 19th century, Africa was divided among them, but Abyssinia remained independent due to its geographical advantages. At that time, Britain feared that the territory would fall into French hands, so it encouraged Italy to seize it. This aroused French suspicion, and France actively sought Abyssinia's friendship, training its troops and supplying it with arms. Abyssinia's ability to defeat the Italian invasion in 1896 was due to French assistance. After that, Italy's ambition toward Abyssinia was somewhat restrained. However, Britain's desire to control Lake Tsana in Abyssinia, to control the source of the Egyptian Nile, remained undiminished. Therefore, in 1902, it threatened the Abyssinian king to conclude the Anglo-Abyssinian Treaty, obtaining the right to build a dam on Lake Tsana. At the same time, it continued to incite the Italians to attack Abyssinia, hoping to profit from it. However, France at this time always regarded maintaining the territorial integrity of Abyssinia as its mission, and always sought to obstruct the actions of Britain and Italy. For example, the Tripartite Agreement on Abyssinia among Britain, France, and Italy, initiated by France in 1906, was a joint commitment to protect Abyssinia's territorial integrity. Abyssinia's accession to the League of Nations in 1923 was also due to French introduction. In 1925, Chamberlain of Britain attempted to reach an understanding with Mussolini to divide spheres of influence, but failed due to French opposition. Therefore, since the 19th century, the country most concerned about Abyssinia's territorial integrity has been France. As for Britain, although it has no territorial ambitions in Abyssinia, it cannot be without demands for controlling the source of the upper Nile. It is human nature to resent when one's demands are not met, and one may even be happy to use the power of others to satisfy one's own desires. This is why the British often tolerate Italy's plans for Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Given the complex relationship among the three countries regarding Abyssinia, Italy's current actions against Abyssinia would be difficult to carry out without the understanding or tacit consent of Britain and France. The understanding of France is especially essential. Since last summer, due to Germany's rapid expansion in Austria, the contradictions between France and Italy have gradually disappeared. And this spring, the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement was established. Considering that France, in this agreement, allowed the Italians to participate in the management of the railway from the Abyssinian capital directly to French Somaliland, it can be seen that France has actually abandoned its policy of assisting Abyssinia against Italy. This railway is operated solely by France and is the only route for Abyssinia to communicate with the outside world. Abyssinia's foreign trade and the import of arms depend on this route for communication. Now that the Italians can participate in the management of this route, they will be able to deal a great blow to Abyssinia in terms of arms inspection. France has already made its intention not to assist Abyssinia clear by granting this power to the Italians. Furthermore, Abyssinia's repeated appeals to the League of Nations have never been placed on the agenda of the Executive Council. France has great influence in the League of Nations. If it wanted to provide assistance, how difficult would it be? Now it turns a blind eye. What does it mean by that? Also, in fact, France wants Italy to support its various plans to stabilize the European situation, and wants Italy not to assist Austria-Hungary in making things difficult for the Little Entente. It must make great concessions to Italy. This is why it cannot but acquiesce in Mussolini's actions against Abyssinia.</p>
<p>That Italy's current actions against Abyssinia have obtained the unofficial understanding of Britain and France has become an open secret. However, it is still difficult to predict whether Mussolini is determined to use force against Abyssinia. First, the territorial integrity of Abyssinia is recognized by the Anglo-Franco-Italian Tripartite Agreement of 1906. Second, Abyssinia is currently a member of the League of Nations. Britain and France now want to fully maintain and strengthen the League of Nations. How can they permanently sit idly by while Abyssinia is being invaded? Furthermore, what about the Italo-Abyssinian arbitration treaty of 1928? How can they abandon it and ignore it? Third, according to Chamberlain's suggestion to Mussolini in 1925, Italy was only allowed to build a transverse railway in Abyssinia. Beyond this, Britain may not allow it. Moreover, Abyssinia is located in a high plateau with towering mountains and rugged terrain. It is easy to defend and difficult to attack. This has always been the case. In addition, the Abyssinians are brave and warlike. Although the Italians have sophisticated weapons, they cannot be without caution. Therefore, it is speculated that Mussolini may not intend to annex Abyssinia. He just wants to demonstrate force against Abyssinia and coerce it into submission. In recent years, due to the unclear Italo-Abyssinian border, the Italians have nibbled away at Abyssinian territory. In order to maintain these occupied territories, they must adopt a very tough attitude. Moreover, in preparation for a second world war, Italy must actively arouse the war sentiment of its people. The current Italo-Abyssinian dispute is an excellent source of material for cultivating this sentiment. Mussolini, with his penetrating vision, would not easily let go of this great opportunity to encourage national war sentiment.</p>

<p>(London) Today's news: The British and French governments are currently considering jointly requesting Italian Prime Minister Mussolini not to engage in combat in East Africa. The note may also indicate that Italy's actions are likely to provoke impeachment by the League of Nations' Executive Council. At the same time, news from East Africa suggests that a large-scale war between Italy and Abyssinia seems imminent. According to dispatches from the Abyssinian capital, a national mobilization plan has been completed. If Italy's military preparations do not stop, this plan will be implemented soon. (12th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) This newspaper is paying extraordinary attention to the increasingly tense Italo-Abyssinian relations. Because Italy and Abyssinia are both members of the League of Nations, if they resort to arms again, it will inevitably deal another blow to the already declining prestige of the League of Nations. Although officials remain silent on the development of this situation, various newspapers have devoted special space to publishing news from Abyssinia, Rome, and London. It was previously reported that the British and French governments will jointly intervene in Rome's actions to make it accept the arbitration methods suggested by the League of Nations. This news has been confirmed by the "Echo de Paris," which said that Britain opposes Italy's desire to resolve this dispute outside the League of Nations. The London correspondent of "Echo de Paris" also said that the British government firmly believes that Italy has decided to seize the provinces of Harar and Ogaden from Abyssinia. Once this happens, not only will the connection between the port of Djibouti in French Somaliland and the hinterland be severed by Italy, but also the source of the upper Nile River will be controlled by Italy. Therefore, the correspondent believes that the British government will not approve of this. (11th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British and French governments will, in the near future, make friendly representations to the Italian government to prevent the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia from becoming increasingly entangled. As for the Abyssinian government, Britain and France will not hesitate to make similar representations. The Abyssinian Emperor has recently sent a note to the Italian government, requesting that the Italo-Abyssinian dispute be submitted to arbitration as soon as possible. The purpose of Britain and France's representations to Italy is to urge Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to make the Abyssinian note produce results. In principle, the submission of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute to arbitration has already been accepted by both Italy and Abyssinia. What London hopes is that Italy will find a way to establish a mixed arbitration committee as soon as possible, so that the Italo-Abyssinian dispute can be eased, and Italy can devote its full strength to resolving the various problems in Europe. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The policies adopted by Italy towards Abyssinia have aroused concern at home and abroad. The "Observer" of London commented that it is impossible to know for sure what the Italian public's mood is like, as the news is divergent. Some believe that many soldiers in the Italian troops sent to Africa have deserted. However, people in Italy say that morale is very high, and more than 30,000 people have voluntarily enlisted in the Italian army. It is only necessary to draw 3% of the total number that can be mobilized in the country to conquer Abyssinia. As for military expenses, the funds for public works can be used, so there is no need to worry about a shortage. After the European War, the Treaty of Versailles entrusted some places to be ruled by the countries of Britain, France, Belgium, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa, but Italy did not get anything. This is a difficult matter. (12th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) After Gong, the Abyssinian police chief of Jijiga, led his subordinates to attack the Italian consulate in November last year, Italy lodged a protest and obtained a solution. Abyssinia also agreed to submit the police chief and others to the court for punishment. Now the Abyssinian government has suddenly released them. Italy believes that Abyssinia lacks sincerity, which is now evident. In addition, it has been confirmed that German reserve officer Stephen is now selling German Junkers aircraft in Abyssinia.

In form, they will meet at the Hibiya Tao Tao Pavilion on the 14th in the name of a current affairs discussion meeting to discuss future countermeasures. Yesterday, on the 11th, a notice was sent out, inviting more than 80 members, and various movements have already begun. However, the movements of the Minseitō and the Kokumin Dōmei, regarding the destruction of the Seiyukai's form of national unity and the organization of a new party, plan to wait for the public's fair judgment before deciding on a method, because there are many who advocate this self-respecting argument, and they may not be eager to establish a new party and withdraw from the party in large numbers at present. However, Watanabe Go, Kishida Masaji, and others from the Mochizuki faction, and Ito Kaizaburo and others from the Akita faction, are jointly opposed to the left-wing figures of the President faction such as Mukai Iwo, Kuramoto Yōichi, and Namba Kiyoto, and are expected to express their determination to leave the party in the middle of this month. However, the Tokonami remnants and the Hokkaido Federation will take a relatively self-respecting attitude and will not leave the party immediately, but will wait for the establishment of the new party. However, it is not known whether a small number of people will leave the party in the near future. (12th Rengo Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Osaka) The Spinning Federation held a reduction-in-operations committee at the Cotton Industry Hall yesterday to discuss everything. Because the major mills' argument against reduction and the small and medium-sized mills' argument for expansion were at odds, no decision was made. Then, after Chairman Kawabe's decision, the following was decided at 9 p.m.: Production adjustment from July 1 to October 31, increasing one day and night in July and August in addition to the current reduction rate, and increasing 6% from September 1 to the end of October in addition to the current rate. However, this resolution will be implemented only if it is approved by three-quarters of the total number of companies and three-quarters of the total number of spindles in the Federation. This reduction rate is equivalent to a 20% stoppage rate in July and August, and a 22.2% rate in September and October. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The first conference of the Soviet Heavy Industry Committee has opened, chaired by Ordzhonikidze, Chairman of the Heavy Industry Committee. Leaders of various companies and directors of various factories and scientific research institutions attended. The meeting first discussed the balance of the Soviet heavy industry in 1934. According to the report, due to the great improvement in technology, the increase in labor productivity, the reduction in production costs, and the emergence of new industries in the enterprises under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Heavy Industry Committee, the total balance as of January 1, 1935, was about 56 billion rubles (46.678 billion rubles on January 1, 1934). On January 1, 1924, the total balance of the entire Soviet industry (including heavy industry, light industry, timber, food, and other industries) was 4.661 billion rubles. The active results of the industry under the jurisdiction of the Heavy Industry Committee in the previous year were even greater in the increase in total production than in the increase in balance. The production station increased by 28.6%, while the balance increased by 19.3%. This point shows that the Soviet enterprises have made progress in the utilization of the value of machinery and materials. The balance of each part of the heavy industry shows the non-parallel development of the Soviet Union's extremely heavy industry. (11th TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) On the last day of the British King's Accession Week, London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Cardiff all had very lively celebrations. The King sent his sons to the provincial capitals as his representatives. Therefore, the Prince of Wales went to Cardiff, the Duke of York and his Duchess went to Edinburgh, and the Duke of Gloucester went to Belfast. There were extremely enthusiastic expressions of support for the King and the royal family everywhere. Each prince spoke in the provincial capitals, all mentioning the King's concern for the pain of unemployment. The highlight of the London celebrations was the large gathering of tens of thousands of schoolchildren. Thousands of children, led carefully by nannies and teachers, went to the stands on Constitution Hill. The area was designated by the King specifically for children's seating, so that they could see the King's majesty and so on. The London City Council, the Public Works Bureau, the police department, and the railways and streetcars pre-planned ways to transport the children, striving for their comfort. After the children entered the stands, they were entertained by military bands and wireless broadcasts. From Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch, the whole route was full of children, numbering no less than 15,000. When the King and others drove past, the children cheered continuously. The King and others enjoyed it. At night, the crowds outside the palace cheered for the King and Queen, who appeared on the balcony under the illumination of electric lights for the public to admire. They waved to the crowd for seven minutes. However, there were so many people coming and going outside the palace, estimated to be more than 250,000. When the King and others appeared, they squeezed each other, causing some to fall to the ground and others to faint. Therefore, the King announced that he would no longer appear on the balcony. After this week, the palace will stop burning colored lights, but many shops and private residences in London and the provinces will continue to celebrate with lights. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) At night, the King and Queen appeared on the palace balcony in response to the cheers of the people. At that time, the people competed to see them, like a tidal wave, causing more than 500 people to faint, and many were pushed to the ground. They were treated by temporary emergency medical stations set up next to the Victoria Memorial. Those who were more serious, including a woman with two broken ribs, were sent to the hospital. There were many people visiting the streets with lively lights, especially St. James's Park. The electric lights there were dazzling, and the flowers and trees were even more beautiful. Trafalgar Square became an open-air ballroom at midnight, with the crowd singing and dancing, led by a man standing on the head of a stone lion. They gradually dispersed after being driven away by the police. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) American famous humorist and movie star Rogers broadcast on the radio today, inviting the British King and Queen to visit the United States. Then he said to the British audience, the King and others may wish to visit this country. You should urge the Prince of Wales to persuade them. The Prince is a good person.

<p>(Moscow) Renowned Soviet political commentator LADDICK, in an article in IZVESTIA, stated that the Franco-Soviet pact is of utmost importance, not only as a weapon of peace but also because a capitalist country has unprecedentedly decided to conclude a mutual assistance pact with the first proletarian state that has achieved victory.</p>
<p>LADDICK mentioned documents from the late 19th century, specifically the negotiations between the French Republic and Imperial Russia for an alliance 44 years prior, pointing out the situation of Imperial Russia at the time. He said, "At that time, Russia had to order 500,000 rifles from France because Russia itself could not produce them. Simultaneously, due to the poverty of the national treasury, it had to borrow from another country to repay debts. Russia at that time could not attain an equal position in diplomatic negotiations."</p>
<p>LADDICK continued, "Today's Soviet Union has established industry and agriculture through the strength of its workers and peasants. In this industrialized and collectivized country, the Little Red Army's armaments are all supplied by domestic industry. This army will surely be able to defend its country against any number of enemies. The Soviet government's conclusion of a mutual assistance pact is not because it cannot obtain foreign aid or defend its country on its own but to demonstrate to those who love military adventures that any country wishing to consolidate peace must engage in collective self-defense actions to deal with them. The Soviet government is different from other countries; it has absolutely no aggressive intentions, nor does it wish to exclude any country. Precisely for this reason, the importance of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact is increasingly strengthened and not diminished." (TASS dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) "CAPITAL JOURNAL" recently published a commentary analyzing the relationship of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty to Britain, stating that "If Germany were to attack the Soviet Union, and France were to provide assistance to the Soviet Union in accordance with the mutual assistance treaty, would Britain then have an obligation to assist Germany in accordance with the Locarno Treaty? If we interpret the terms of the treaty, the Locarno Treaty does not actually have this kind of constraint, because France's assistance to the Soviet Union is based on the provisions of Article 16 and Article 15, Section 7 of the League of Nations Covenant. The Locarno Treaty itself already stipulates that sanctions actions stipulated by the League of Nations Covenant cannot be regarded as aggression against the territory of another country. Therefore, Britain would have no obligation to assist Germany," (Havas dispatch of the 12th)</p>

Beck immediately expressed his agreement. In addition, Laval did not express opposition to Poland maintaining friendly relations with Germany. Laval's trip to Warsaw did not change the general situation on the surface, but Poland has realized that the French government still treats Poland as an allied country, and Poland's position is actually equal to that of the Soviet Union." The National Socialist Party's organ, the People's Observer, stated, "Poland will continue to actively operate in Eastern Europe, because France and Russia are attempting to establish a security system, and Poland cannot remain indifferent, lest the country's current foreign policy be affected."

Relations between the two countries have indeed returned to a state of easing. French Foreign Minister Laval has proven to Colonel Beck that the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact does not conflict with the German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, the Russian-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, and the Franco-Polish Alliance. He also stated that Germany has always expressed its participation in consultative and non-aggression collective pacts, and France is now preparing to promote the establishment of this pact. Poland does not intend to reject this proposal, but on the condition that the country's special interests in the Baltic Sea coast are not despised. Poland also agreed to participate in the negotiations for the Danube River Non-Interference in Internal Affairs Pact and will take advantage of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting (on the 20th of this month) to go to Geneva to participate in preparatory talks. At that time, Laval will conduct negotiations with representatives from related countries, especially the Little Entente countries, so that the Rome Conference can be successfully concluded.

<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Jinan Station Investigation Team of the First Route of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway recently received a confidential report stating that Hu Yanyu, a luggage clerk of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, was privately carrying a large quantity of narcotics from Tianjin to Jinan for sale. He was on the 75th train, which was scheduled to arrive in Jinan at around 11:00 AM. Niu Zhensan, the investigation officer of the team, immediately notified the station the previous night (the 10th) at around 11:00 PM before the 75th train entered the station, requesting the station to dispatch the deputy station master and the section chief of the railway police department, as well as investigators from the team, ten soldiers with pistols, and Tianjin-Pukou Railway police to wait at the station in preparation for inspection. At 11:40 PM, the train entered the station. Niu Zhensan and others immediately went to the luggage car and strictly guarded both doors. Together with the deputy station master of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the railway police, they began the inspection. In addition to the luggage clerk Hu Yanyu, there were also Kang De, a dismissed Tianjin-Pukou Railway worker, and Tian Shuifa, a dismissed tea server, who were secretly transporting goods on the train. The car contained Hu Yanyu's leather suitcases and fresh goods, shoes, children's toys, and other items. The investigation team, together with the railway personnel, opened all the items and conducted a thorough inspection. Hu Yanyu, seeing the large number of soldiers and police and realizing the seriousness of the situation, immediately changed his expression, panicking and at a loss. The suspicion of the investigators grew, and the search became more stringent. As expected, 380 packets of heroin were found in Hu's suitcase. The narcotics were confiscated, and the suspect was arrested. Kang De and Tian Yongfa, who were on the same train, were also considered highly suspicious and were arrested as well. At around 1:00 AM this morning (the 11th), they were escorted to the military law department of the headquarters for interrogation. After receiving the case, the military law department, led by military judge Zhang Tieqiao, conducted a rigorous interrogation at around 9:00 AM this morning. Hu Yanyu was interrogated first. According to his confession, "I am 36 years old, from Yixian County, Hebei Province. I have been working at the Tianjin-Pukou Railway since 1919 and am currently a luggage clerk. I bought raw heroin twice in Tianjin last month, totaling 300 yuan. This time, I bought three and a half, weighing twelve taels, worth 200 yuan. The total value of the three purchases is about 500 yuan, of which 150 yuan belongs to Liu Baoqing and 300 yuan to Zhang himself. Kang De and Tian Yongfa do not own any of the heroin. The fresh goods, shoes, and other items are what they were selling. What I have confessed is the truth." Next, Kang De was interrogated. According to his confession, "I am 60 years old, from Shanhaiguan, and currently reside in Tianjin. I used to work on the railway but was dismissed. Because I know many people on the railway, I travel back and forth with the train to sell goods. This time, I bought some ice cream cones and children's toys from Tianjin to sell. I have never carried raw heroin. As for Mr. Hu's heroin, I know nothing about it. What I have confessed is the truth." Tian Yongfa also confessed, "I am 24 years old, from Shenxian County, Hebei Province. I used to work as a tea server on the railway but no longer do. Now, I follow the train to sell some fresh goods to earn some money. As for the heroin, I really don't know anything about it. What I have confessed is the truth." (11th)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Important Communist Bandit Leaders Qu Qiubai and Others Captured in Western Fujian, Along with Female Bandits Zhou Yuelin and Zhang Liang; Deng Zihui Escapes, He Shuheng Killed, Xiang Ying Reportedly Captured in Xingguo, Jiangxi <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Among the top Communist Party leaders, Qu Qiubai, the General Secretary of the pseudo-Central Party Headquarters, whose position was second only to Mao Zedong, a pseudo-Central Executive Committee member, and Chairman of the Education People's Committee of the pseudo-Central Soviet Government, was recently discovered to have been captured by the 14th Security Regiment at Lutan, five miles west of Shuikou, at the intersection of Changting and Shanghang. At the same time, Zhang Liang, the wife of pseudo-Central Government Vice Chairman Xiang Ying, and Zhou Yuelin, the wife of Liang Baitai, the pseudo-Central Government Minister of Internal Affairs and a pseudo-Central Committee member and Minister of Women's Affairs, were also captured. Zhong Shaokui, the commander of the 14th Regiment, escorted the two female bandits, Zhou and Zhang, to the Longyan Second District Pacification Headquarters for interrogation on the 7th. The following is a record of the capture of the Qu bandit and others:</p>
<p>When the Red bandits abandoned western Jiangxi and fled, Qu Qiubai was seriously ill, and Zhang Liang was pregnant and unable to follow. Both remained in Tangwu, Huichang. Later, due to the National Army's search and suppression, they could not establish a foothold. Therefore, the pseudo-Fujian Military Region (now eliminated) dispatched a company of pseudo-special agents to escort them back to the so-called rear area of Yongding and Longyan. In addition to Qu, Zhou, and Zhang, there were Deng Zihui, Chairman of the pseudo-Central Finance People's Committee, He Shuheng, a member of the pseudo-Central Executive Committee, another person from Yongding, a party of six, and the pseudo-special agent company. When they reached Lutan, five miles from Shuikou at the intersection of Ting and Hang, they crossed the river and advanced. The Zhong Regiment was originally stationed in Wuping County and the western district of Shanghang County, and happened to be patrolling near Shuikou. They received a report from the villagers that bandits were passing through. They led their troops to suppress and surround the bandits, seizing many guns, killing several bandits, and capturing several bandits. At that time, Zhang Liang falsely claimed to be Zhou Yulian, the wife of a mushroom merchant, who had been kidnapped and extorted by the Red bandits. Qu falsely claimed to be Lin Qixiang, a hospital doctor, and Zhou falsely claimed to be Chen Xiuying, a female nurse at the hospital. This happened at the end of March, and Dun Chu did not know that these three were the top bandits. Coincidentally, there was a conscript in the regiment who had been captured in the northern district of Wuping and had surrendered. One day, during the interrogation of Qu and others, the conscript happened to pass by the hall and was asked if he recognized the prisoners. The soldier had been to Ruijin. After being asked, he nodded and withdrew to another room, informing that one of the women was Zhang Liang. Zhong became very attentive to this. He interrogated Qu and others again, but Zhang still denied it. The soldier came out to confront her, and she finally confessed. However, Zhang still did not reveal Qu and Zhou. Later, the 36th Division of Changting obtained information from the captured Chairman of the pseudo-Zhaozheng County Soviet that Qu and others had been captured. At the same time, the Second District Pacification Department received a telegram from Tao, the commander of the 8th Division, stating that a captured bandit had confessed that Qu Qiubai and others had been captured by the National Army at Shuikou. They telegraphed Commander Zhong to investigate and reply. The captured bandit confessed that the special agent company escorted Qu and others, and each person had a Mauser pistol with them. And those seized that day were indeed Mauser pistols, so it was believed that Qu should have been captured. Song, the commander of the 36th Division, telegraphed to have Qu escorted to Changting so that the captured bandits could identify him. After Zhang confessed that she was Zhang Liang, the Zhong Regiment Headquarters treated Zhang and Zhou very favorably. Later, Zhou Yuelin, grateful for the preferential treatment, confessed everything. Only then did they know that the person named Lin Zuxiang was indeed Qu Qiubai. Therefore, Zhang and Zhou were escorted to Longyan, and sedans and horses were prepared for them to ride. After arriving in Longyan, the two female prisoners were interrogated by the military law department of the Second District Pacification Headquarters on the night of the 7th, and they confessed in detail. Only then did they learn that He Shuheng was killed on the spot, Deng Zihui had escaped, Deng was from Longyan, was more agile, and was familiar with the Hakka dialect of Longyan and Yongding, so he was able to slip through the net. Zhou and Zhang are currently detained in the cavalry company of the 10th Division in Longyan. Qu Qiubai will be escorted from Changting to Longyan. Qu was the leader of the pro-Russian faction of the Communist Party. After Chen Duxiu was expelled, Qu took his place as the Secretary of the pseudo-Central Party Headquarters and was known as the "Russian expert." The following are the confessions of Zhou and Zhang regarding their work in the Communist Party and their capture with Qu:</p>
<p>Zhou Yuelin Confesses</p>
<p>My surname is Zhou, my name is Yuelin. After being captured this time, I used the false name Chen Xiuying. I am 28 years old this year, from Ningbo, Zhejiang. I am the wife of Liang Baitai, the pseudo-Minister of Internal Affairs. When I was over ten years old, I was a female worker at the Dakang Yarn Factory opened by the Japanese in Shanghai. The May Thirtieth Massacre occurred in 1925, and all the factories went on strike. At that time, Li Lisan presided over the General Labor Union, and the workers of all factories were mostly under his command. In June of the same year, I was introduced to the Communist Party and assigned to work in the Second Office of the Labor Union. In 1926, the General Labor Union sent me and Gu Chengzhang and others to Russia. All travel expenses were provided by them. My level was very poor, so I stayed in Vladivostok to attend a primary Soviet school. What I learned was all basic subjects, such as arithmetic, Chinese, and Russian alphabet. Coincidentally, Liang Baitai was working in the Soviet Party Department in Vladivostok. I met and married him. Liang Baitai was sent to law school. In the winter of 1929, I went to Moscow alone, intending to enter a school if possible, otherwise I would return to Vladivostok. When I arrived in Moscow, I found the Chinese delegation and was introduced to the Lenin Academy for accommodation. At that time, there were no enrollments yet, and I had to wait until the summer of the following year to enter the school. The following year (1930), I officially entered the accelerated program of the Lenin Academy. The accelerated program was divided into Chinese, German, French, English, and other classes. I lived in a room with an English girl, a German girl, and an African girl. The English and African girls entered the English class, the German girl entered the German class, and I entered the Chinese class. The subjects I learned were deeper, including politics, economics, and society. Because of my weak health, I went to southern Russia to recuperate. Liang Baitai telegraphed from Vladivostok, instructing me to return to China with him. We stayed at the Zhejiang Hotel in Shanghai. The pseudo-Central Committee sent a liaison officer to the hotel to contact Liang to work in the bandit area. I asked to go with him and was allowed, but I suddenly fell ill, so Liang went first. A month later, after I recovered, I went from Shanghai to Hong Kong, via Shantou and Dabu, to the bandit area. It happened to be the first Soviet Congress, and Liang and I attended as observers. The pseudo-Central Committee, considering that Liang had studied law, ordered him to work in the pseudo-Ministry of Justice. Zhang Guotao, the pseudo-Minister of Justice, was not in Ruijin, so Liang was actually responsible for the ministry's affairs. Liang proposed that I be a Central Labor Inspector and also the Director of the Women's Improvement Committee, but both positions were empty shells with nothing to do. Later, Qin Bangxian and Zhang Wentian came from Shanghai and believed that the Women's Improvement Committee had no organization. At the same time, the pseudo-government did not yet have a Women's Department, so they established one and I became the Minister. The responsibility of the Women's Department was to inspect the results of women's movements in various places and review their reports. I was inherently not suited for this kind of work, and Liang also thought it was inappropriate. Coincidentally, Dean Fu of the National Hospital had a violent temper and did not care about the patients' opinions, so I was appointed Dean. At the Second Soviet Congress, I was elected as a member of the pseudo-Central Executive Committee, a member of the Presidium, and also a member of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Committee, but all of the above were only nominal, and there was actually no work to do. All kinds of powers were in the hands of Zhu, Mao, Xiang, and Zhang. Last October, the pseudo-Red China Daily suddenly published an editorial stating that the Fourth Front Army of Yu, E, and Wan, led by Xu Xiangqian, had entered Sichuan, and we should also respond, which aroused suspicion among many people. I worked in the hospital and knew nothing about the westward flight plan. Liang Baitai also did not know. When the bandits fled westward, it was called organizing a field army. Half a month after the field army set off, Xiang Ying suddenly issued a notice ordering the dissolution of the National Hospital and the return of the patients. At this time, Liang Baitai and Xiang Ying were in the same place. Liang told me, "Your body is not well, and you can't walk. You can pretend to be a member of the masses and hide." So he took a letter of introduction from the Organization Department and went to Tangwu Fujian Provincial Soviet. In Tangwu, I saw Chairman Liao (name unknown). He sent me to Jin Fang to live in the home of a Mr. Xie. The township Soviet received an order from the provincial Soviet to give me a dan of grain husks every two months. The first time, I was given four dan. Mr. Xie also did not know who I was, but only knew that I was a refugee. Life was extremely difficult, with no oil or salt to eat. The Fujian Provincial Soviet, because Jin Fang was oppressed by the National Army, instructed me to go to Tangwu to decide what to do. In the Tangwu Provincial Soviet, I met Qu Qiubai, He Shuheng, Deng Zihui, Zhang Liang, and another person from Yongding. The provincial Soviet wanted the six of us to go to Yongding to work with the masses, so as not to have nowhere to settle down. There were five soldiers with box cannons escorting us. At the end of March, we were discovered near Shuikou in Wuping and captured. I and Qu Qiubai and Zhang Liang were captured, Deng Zihui and others escaped, their whereabouts unknown. After arriving at the 14th Security Regiment, I heard the soldiers say that an old man was injured and refused to leave, so he was shot and killed. That old man was He Shuheng. Only then did I know that He had been killed. I gave the name Chen Xiuying at the regiment headquarters. After repeated inquiries, I was grateful for the preferential treatment, so I revealed the truth and was escorted to Longyan with Zhang Liang. Qu Qiubai was escorted to Tingzhou. I have not heard from Liang Bailiu since we separated. I still have two sons in Russia, one named Yisuoka and one named Weilin, now eight and seven years old. They were sent to a nursery as soon as they were born and raised. I have never communicated with them since I returned to China, and I don't know what they look like now. As for the letter of repentance, I will write and submit it separately."</p>
<p>Zhang Liang Confesses</p>
<p>My surname is Zhang, my name is Liang, my original name is Zhang Lianyu. I am from Luoshan, Sichuan, and I am 30 years old this year. When I was young, I married Guo Jian as my wife. Guo Jian's alias is Maoliang. He is from Jiading, Sichuan, and runs a salt well as a business. His family is quite wealthy. In 1925, Guo and I went to Shanghai. Guo wanted to find work, and I entered Qinyie Women's Normal School to study, but my level was low, and I could not pass the exam. So I entered the school as a tutor, working and studying part-time. Guo soon returned to Sichuan and did not come to Shanghai. I had no money to use, so I looked for my fellow villagers Zhang Zidou and Liu Jing. Zhang introduced me to work in his Zhonghua Industrial Factory. The May Thirtieth Massacre occurred, and the factories went on strike for three days. After the resumption of work, the labor union was established, and I joined the labor union. Guo Luzhen, a female graduate of Peking University, asked me if I wanted to study. I answered that I was willing. In 1926, the labor union sent me to Moscow to enter Oriental University. Because my level was too shallow, I only entered the literacy class to study Chinese. Soon after, I fell ill and returned to Shanghai to recuperate in 1927. At this time, my relationship with the Party had been interrupted. I had to find a fellow villager's home to recuperate. Soon after, the Zhabei riot occurred. After the failure, I found the Zhabei District Committee again and rejoined the Party. This was in June. I was sent to Wuhan to work in the labor union as an inspector. After the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, I returned to Shanghai and made a living by stringing pearl flowers. Three months later, I met an acquaintance and re-established contact with the Party. Ms. Wang Yazhang, who was originally the Minister of Women Workers of the Wuhan General Labor Union, introduced me to Xiang Ying. Soon after, we got married. Xiang was working in the Labor Union Federation. Soon after, Xiang was sent to the Soviet Union. I went back to work in the factory. Because I was pregnant, I rented a place in the General Labor Union with a subsidy of seven yuan per month. In 1929, Xiang returned from Russia, and I gave birth to a girl. The subsidy was increased by five yuan per month. Xiang was still working in the Labor Union Federation. In 1930, Xiang came to the bandit area. I was still in Shanghai. In 1932, I entered the bandit area via Hong Kong and Dabu, and I was assigned to be a labor inspector. At this time, I was pregnant again and could not work. So I went to the Party school to study for a month and a half. After leaving the school, I translated ordinary telegrams for the pseudo-Central Committee. In March 1932, I gave birth to a boy. Xiang Ying and I often quarreled. Xiang never talked to me about anything. He often said, "Do I have to tell my wife everything?" Last October, after the field army set off, the Central Government Rear Office was established, with Xiang as the director. There was a standing committee in the office, with Xiang, Deng Zihui, He Shuheng, Liang Baitai, and others as members. Qu Qiubai had severe lung disease and could not work and suffered from headaches. The office was first in Meikeng and later moved to Gaoweinao. I was pregnant and suffered greatly from the travel. The one-year-old boy I gave birth to last year died from illness due to traveling in the wind and snow. On January 10 this year, Xiang Ying told me to pretend to be a member of the masses and hide. I asked him where to go. He said he was also going to the field army. I and Qu Qiubai, He Shuheng, Deng Zihui, and others took letters of introduction to the Fujian Provincial Soviet in Tangwu. Deng Zihui handled everything. I heard that Chairman Liao of the Provincial Soviet sent us to Yongding. The next day, Zhou Yuelin came and we went together. We were captured by the 14th Security Regiment in Shuikou. Those captured were me, Qu Qiubai, and Zhou Yuelin. Deng Zihui and another person from Yongding had escaped. He Shuheng was heard to have been killed. After arriving at the regiment headquarters, I heard the soldiers say that an old man had been shot and killed, and it could be concluded that it was He. At the regiment headquarters, I gave the name Zhou Lianyu and was sent to the county government for custody. A merchant without a son heard that I was pregnant and guaranteed me to go out to give birth. The child born would be his. I was guaranteed to stay in his store. Because Zhou Yuelin had already told the truth, we were escorted here together. As for Xiang Ying's news, I have not heard from him for a long time. I will write a letter of repentance separately, but I am not good at writing and do not know many characters, so it is difficult for me to write. Can I dictate it to be written for me?"</p>
<p>According to news from Ganzhou from the Longyan area, Xiang Ying was besieged by the Fourth Division in Wantianshali, Ruijin, and fled to Guantian in Xingguo, where he was captured alive by the local militia in a desperate situation. Xiang Ying successively served as the Chairman of the pseudo-Military Commission and a member of the pseudo-Central Committee. When Zhu and Mao fled westward, Xiang presided over the remaining bandits. (May 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Hebei Special Police Enter the War Zone - 10,000 Troops to be Stationed in the War Zone; Liu and Zhao Security Teams to be Reorganized <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Negotiations on the rotation of security teams in the war zone have been going on for years. Only on the 10th of this month was an agreement finally reached. The newly organized First and Second Regiments of the Hebei Province Special Police began to move on the 10th. The First Regiment, led by Zhang Qingyu, marched from the Caicun defense area towards Tongxian, camping in Yanjiao that night. On the morning of the 11th, they entered the war zone, passing through Yutian, and then divided into Jixian, Shunyi, Sanhe, Huairou, and Miyun to take over defense. The regiment headquarters is located in Yutian County, with the First District Headquarters in Jixian and the Second District Headquarters in Shunyi. The First Regiment of the original security team stationed in the five counties of Ji, Huai, Zun, Mi, and Shun, led by Fan Yongxiang, will leave the war zone after handing over the defense. They will gather in Matou Village, Tongxian, and transfer to Pingnanyuan, where they will be disbanded and then head to northern Hubei, still under the command of Liu Duoquan's original division. The Third Security Regiment stationed in Yutian, led by Zhou Yuying, will move to Zunhua and Qian'an. Part of this team is also stationed in Funing, Qinhuangdao, Haiyangzhen, and Beidaihe. After the special police of Zhang Yantian's team take over the defense, they will also be transferred to Zun and Qian to be responsible for bandit suppression for a period of two months. After the banditry is eliminated, they will return to the war zone and return to their original divisions and brigades. This is the step-by-step movement of the new and old teams in the Ji-Mi area, which will take about a week to complete. The Second Regiment of the Special Police, led by Zhang Yantian, boarded the train from the Cangxian defense area at 5:00 PM on the 10th. Due to the lack of vehicles on the Tianjin-Pukou and Beining railways, only two trains were allocated, one with twenty open cars and the other with seventeen. The train carrying the first batch of troops was attached to the Tianjin-Pukou No. 402 slow train and departed at 6:30 PM. It passed through Tianjin at around 0:40 AM on the 11th, stopped briefly, and headed east, entering the war zone via Tangshan on the evening of the 11th. The second batch of troops departed at 9:00 PM on the 10th, passed through Tianjin at around 7:00 AM on the 11th, and headed east, entering the war zone that night. They got off along the designated defense area and went to Funing, Lulong, Haiyangzhen, Qinhuangdao, Fengrun, and other places to take over defense. At the same time, the Second Regiment of the old security team, led by Yang Yucheng, gathered at Liushouying, Changli, and took the vehicles transporting the special police, leaving the war zone that day and returning to their original defense area in Junliangcheng. The Second Regiment of the Special Police set up its headquarters in Liushouying, with the First District Headquarters in Qian'an and the Second District Headquarters in Funing. Changli and Leting defense areas - there was originally a proposal to have the First Regiment of the War Zone Security Force, led by Liu Zuozhou, fill the defense, but it has been decided not to station any troops there for the time being. The surplus of several hundred men from Liu Zuozhou's team will be reorganized after the new and old teams are rotated, and then a part will be sent to Changle. However, due to the difficulty in allocating vehicles, it will take more than ten days to complete the deployment of Zhang Yantian's team, which requires seven trains. The troop rotation in the Yu area is more complicated than that in the Su-Mi area. It is difficult to say whether there are still twists and turns in the middle. Da Mu, Ishii, and Douxie, staff officers of the Japanese Army Command in Tianjin, accompanied by Jiangtou, and accompanied by Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming, went to Tongxian and Tangshan early on the 9th to take an attitude of inspecting the special police entering the war zone to ensure that the number of people and guns met the agreed number.</p>
<p>After the special police enter, the troops stationed in the war zone in the future will include 5,000 men from Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian's teams, still called the First and Second Regiments of the Hebei Province Special Police, so as not to be limited to permanent stationing in the war zone and can be transferred to other counties at any time. Liu Zuozhou and Zhao Lei's teams each have 2,000 men, still called the First and Second Regiments of the Hebei Province War Zone Security Force, limited to stationing in the war zone to maintain local security. Li Yunsheng's team has 1,000 men, called the Hebei Province War Zone Security Supplementary Regiment, also limited to stationing in the war zone. However, the three teams of Liu, Zhao, and Li must be reorganized to meet the provincial regulations on the number of personnel. Zhou Yuying's team has 2,000 men, originally called the Third Regiment of the Hebei Province Security Force, with the same organization as the two teams of Fan Shuihe and Yang Yucheng, which were transferred out of the war zone. After Fan and Yang leave, Zhou will only temporarily remain in the war zone and will be transferred out in a short time. The actual statistics of the war zone troops total 10,000 men. As for the unification of the names and numbers of the teams, the province has no intention of doing so, because the special police under the two Zhangs are organized as one regiment, with two district teams under its jurisdiction, and three large teams under each district team. The two teams of Liu and Zhao have four large teams directly under each regiment, and Li Yunsheng's team has three large teams under one regiment. The number of people and organization are different, so it is also difficult to unify the numbers and names. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Remnant Bandits Roaming Through the Border Between Hubei and Anhui - The Main Force Has Been Pursued and Eliminated by Liang Guanying's Troops; Local Militias in Huangmei and Other Counties Blocked and Killed Bandit Leaders <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The remnant bandits in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have recently roamed through Susong and Taihu counties in Anhui, and Qichun and Huangmei counties in Hubei. They have been largely eliminated by Liang Guanying's troops. The local militias of various counties assisted in blocking and killing many bandit team leaders and followers, which was also quite effective. Previously, more than 1,000 remnant troops and guns of the pseudo-28th Army sneaked into Erlang River in Susong County, Anhui Province, in the middle of last month, with the intention of invading eastern Hubei. Huangmei County, only fifty miles away from the area, was particularly vulnerable. The people had long been disturbed by the bandits and were easily frightened, fleeing in droves. Wu Dehuai, the county magistrate of Huangmei, learned that the bandits would enter the territory and immediately mobilized the second battalion commander Chen Weizhen, the sixth company commander Cai Shie, the armed police captain Wu Huating, and the district chief Deng Fuchang to lead the local militia, police force, and volunteer team to Tingqianyi to prevent the bandits from entering. The bandits, after arriving near Tingqian, did not dare to attack lightly and detoured through Changxi Mountain in Susong into Maojiaju and Wang Yuchong in Qichun County. The third battalion commander Huang Liwu stationed in the county engaged in interception and suppression, and the troops of the 25th Route Army also followed and pursued. The bandits, with enemies on both sides, fled south to Tangjiashan and Wangjiashan at the junction of Qi and Huang, intending to continue south to Chengshengyi in northern Huangmei, or to Baiyangling via Jiandao, because the area is mountainous and suitable for occupying. At this time, the Tingqian militia stationed in Huangmei was transferred by the county magistrate's order to Chengshengyi and Baiyangling day and night to establish a strict defense. They announced that the Guangji County militia would come to support, and the people who had fled saw the arrival of the large forces and returned home one after another. The old and weak helped with guarding, and the able-bodied men participated in the blocking and suppression. The bandits, fearing being surrounded if they went deeper, changed their plan again. On the 20th, they turned northeast between Tangwang Mountain and fled back to Susong and Taihu. The three counties of Qichun, Huangmei, and Guangji in eastern Hubei were all spared from banditry. Now, the three counties of Qi, Huang, and Guang are carrying out large-scale cleanups at the same time. Except for Guangji, which has no bandits, there is a group of about 60 or 70 people hidden in Yanshouan on the border of Qi and Huang, and a group of about 50 or 60 people in Huangzhuguo. On the 21st, the county magistrate of Huangmei directed the local militia and volunteer team to search Yanshouan, killing a pseudo-team leader named Zhang Hu and more than ten bandits on the spot, and seizing a red flag, bandit hats, clothing, and other items. They then took advantage of the victory to search Huangzhuyuan, but the bandits had already fled and disappeared. At this point, there were no bandit traces in eastern Hubei. The bandits who fled back to the Anhui border were also caught up and severely damaged by Liang's army and have now been eliminated. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">JINAN AREA - DISCOVERY OF IRON ARTIFACTS FROM THE ZHOU DYNASTY - THE GREATEST FIND IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORY <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ancient Chinese implements initially consisted of stone and pottery. Bronze was first used during the Shang Dynasty. As for ironware, although it initially appeared in Guanzi's "Qingzhong Pian" (Essays on Economic Policy), there were only written records, and no actual artifacts have been seen. Wu Dacheng once obtained an iron coin mold from the Zhou Dynasty, which was already considered a rare treasure. Among other ironware discoveries, the earliest was the iron voucher from the Qin Dynasty. Ironware from before the Qin Dynasty is extremely difficult to obtain. When ironware was invented remains a major question for archaeologists due to a lack of supporting evidence. Unexpectedly, recently in Xiaonanying, 80 li (about 25 miles) southeast of Jinan City, four pieces of Zhou Dynasty ironware were discovered, representing an unprecedented major harvest in Chinese archaeological history. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Xiaonanying, 80 li southeast of Jinan City, was formerly named Panlong Village, and is now called Xiaonanying. Four li north of the village is Danan Village. According to local legend, the Song Dynasty general Yang Ye stationed his camp here, hence the name Xiaonanying Village. Some days ago, farmers in the village discovered an ancient tomb about half a li southwest of the village. After digging two meters deep, they found many human bones, including what appeared to be skull, rib, and shin bones, as well as numerous bronze artifacts, categorized and arranged: spears were placed together, and swords were placed together. Most remarkably, there were two spear-shaped weapons, which had never been seen before. Each had a handle, all made of bronze. Northwest of the bronze artifacts, about half a meter away, three or four hoe-shaped iron tools and one guillotine-shaped iron tool were found, extremely thick and large, with holes in the handle. There was also a stone implement, shaped like a teacup. The farmers, seeing that the iron was rusty and thinking it had no value, only brought the bronze artifacts to the provincial capital for sale. Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, purchased them and recognized them as Zhou Dynasty bronze artifacts. He repeatedly inquired if there were any other items. The farmers then revealed that there were also the aforementioned iron tools. Upon hearing this, Wang was overjoyed. He inquired further and learned it was an ancient tomb, as the villagers were initially afraid of being punished for digging up a tomb and were reluctant to speak. Wang immediately instructed the farmers to send the iron tools to the library for research. The farmers, thinking that a pile of scrap iron was worthless, readily agreed. The co-location of bronze and iron artifacts has not been found in Yin Ruins (near Anyang), making this the first such find. The presence of ironware from the Zhou Dynasty can be proven by the Zhou Dynasty bronze artifacts, making this an important discovery in Chinese archaeological history.</p>
<h3 id="e82">SONGJIANG - COUNTY GOVERNMENT STRICTLY PUNISHES SOIL PEDDLERS <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>In this county, the peddling of illicit soil has always been managed by a few northerners residing in Songjiang, whether they were veterans or residents from other places. They all made a living by peddling soil. Since this province implemented the ban on opium, these guest residents engaged in illicit soil peddling have not reduced their activities in the slightest, continuing to traffic it as before, causing the official opium dens' business to plummet, making it impossible to maintain. Previously, detectives apprehended Sha Baozhong, a well-known guest resident engaged in illicit soil peddling, seizing thirteen taels of illicit soil. He was handed over by the Anti-Opium Committee to the county government for interrogation. Yesterday (the 11th), Zhu Yiyi, the section chief of the county government, sentenced Sha Baozhong to ten years of imprisonment. As for the soil trafficker Liu Shuye who was apprehended, yesterday, Yao, the secretary of the County Anti-Opium Committee, Zhou Mian, the inspection section chief, and He Runzhang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, led a team to Liu Shuye's home and searched it again, finding another package of soil, weighing one tael. The house where the Liu family lived was originally sealed off with three seals, but after yesterday's inspection, only the main door was sealed. The county's determination to ban opium is evident from this.</p>
<h3 id="e83">WUXI - STARVING PEOPLE IN DISASTER AREAS DIG FOR SMILAX CHINA ROOT <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Last year's severe drought caused widespread suffering. The disaster was especially severe in the Anzhen Jiaoshan area of the seventh district of this county. The terrain there is relatively high, and last summer's severe drought left the fields barren, leading to a food shortage. The farmers' livelihood was almost exhausted, and they lacked grain to eat. Since the beginning of spring, the panic has worsened. Many farmers have gone to the foot of Jiaoshan Mountain to dig for Smilax china roots (also known as Guanyin vine, yellow in color and hard in texture). They wash off the mud, soak it in clean water to remove the red color, cut it into thin slices, and dry it in the sun. After it is dried, they grind it into powder, remove the rough outer skin, and make cakes to fill their stomachs. In the Dongfeng Huadafang Village area of the third district, farmers are also suffering from food shortages. Since the beginning of spring, they have eaten almost half of the rice seeds they had stored from last year for spring planting. Others grind soybean cakes and corn into flour and cook it to eat. The poorest people have to divide one soybean cake to eat over five or six days.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning (the 12th) at 1:15 AM, the southeast corner of the city was suddenly covered in dense black clouds and faint lightning, as if a thunderstorm was about to descend. Before long, a hurricane struck, flying sand and stones, like ten thousand horses galloping. Pedestrians on the road were nearly knocked over, many glass windows were shattered, streetlights were all extinguished, trees were broken and uprooted, creating extremely dangerous conditions. Electrical wires were broken, houses collapsed, and people were injured, causing very serious losses. Around 2:00 AM, the wind began to subside. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Outside the Guangfu Gate, at the Zikang Silk Factory at the base of the city wall, a large iron chimney, over ten zhang (about 100 feet) long, was suddenly blown down by the hurricane at 2:05 AM. The upper section fell inside the city, smashing through the roof beam of Xu Shunchang Coal Store at No. 25 Hongqiao Bridge. Xu Guiquan, the store owner, his wife, and their children all escaped in their sleep, but Xu's adopted daughter-in-law, Chen Cuie, who was sleeping in the attic, did not have time to escape and was crushed to death. The chimney is very heavy and cannot be removed immediately, so the body is still trapped in the house. Fresh blood can be seen dripping down from the attic, a truly tragic sight.</p>
<p>The intensity of this hurricane has not been seen in decades. Many houses in the city and countryside were blown down. Hundreds of telephone lines in the city were cut off. In the rural areas of Tangkou, Oudang Bridge, and Yanqiao, telephone service was also disrupted. Repairs are currently underway. Many power lines were also blown down, and in Lishe, two utility poles were toppled. At the Yuanhe Teahouse in Shitangwan, a chimney was blown down. Many trees were uprooted in Huishan and other places. The bean and wheat crops in the countryside were blown over. Fortunately, it did not rain, otherwise the losses would have been even greater. Many mulberry trees were also broken, and roofs were blown off. The wooden sign of the Provincial Education Institute on Tonghui Road and many advertisement boards at the railway station were blown down. Over a dozen cattle sheds were blown away at Xueyan Bridge. Some boats in the outer river capsized. All night boats in the villages stopped halfway to avoid danger.</p>
<p>At Qishuyan Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, an empty car, parked on a siding, was secured with an iron crowbar to prevent movement. Unexpectedly, the car was hit by the wind and began to move forward, causing the iron crowbar to break under the weight. The car derailed and overturned beside the track. At Lucheng Station, an empty car was blown all the way to near Benniu Station. The stations in Wuxi, Shitanwan, etc., did not suffer any losses; only various advertising signs, etc., near the stations were blown to the ground. In addition, the newly built awning of the Jiangnan Motor Company, valued at over 500 yuan, was also blown down. Fortunately, the twenty new cars inside the awning were not damaged. Furthermore, the long-distance telephone line from Zhenjiang to Nanjing was completely cut off, making it impossible to talk. Repairs are currently underway. That night, there was also intense lightning in the city, like a searchlight, which those who saw it called a wonder.</p>

<p>For several days, the temperature in this city has reached as high as 96 degrees, like the heat of summer. Yesterday at 11:30 PM, the weather suddenly changed, with flashes of lightning and distant loud noises coming from the northwest, like the clamor of thousands of troops. About five minutes later, the hurricane struck, with the force of overturning mountains and overturning seas. All things cried out together, and glass windows and roof tiles flew like paper scraps into the sky. The city's streetlights were immediately extinguished, and telephone and telegraph services were also cut off. Fires broke out in several places. The fire brigade, threatened by the wind, dispatched very few people. Countless boats along the riverfront lost their moorings and disappeared. Near the station, trees were uprooted and houses collapsed. Advertisement boards along the road to the station were all blown down onto the road, cutting off traffic. Night trains arriving at the station were delayed by two hours. Huts near the flour mill were all burned down. At 10:00 PM, thunder and lightning were intense, and heavy rain poured down. By 3:00 AM this morning, the wind and rain gradually subsided. Afterwards, in the dim night, the reporter took an electric torch and personally went to investigate the area along the riverfront. Along the way, collapsed walls and uprooted houses were seen everywhere. Countless utility poles and trees were broken by the wind. Electrical wires were strewn all over the ground. Countless boats, estimated to be over 170, sank from North Zhoushan to Xiaomatou River. Near the Pingzheng Bridge, piles of broken boat planks and wood were stacked almost like a small hill. At that time, the Tongyi Steamer, which was docked at the Hexing Wharf, was also sunk by the wind and waves. The anchor chain of the British inland river gunboat Sandpiper, which was docked in the center of the river, was also broken and ran aground on the riverbank. Other losses in various places are difficult to estimate at this time. A detailed report will be provided after further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e86">CITY PARTY HEADQUARTERS AND SOCIAL BUREAU ISSUE REGULATIONS FOR ESTABLISHING LITERACY SCHOOLS BY SOCIETIES - SCHOOLS MUST OPEN BEFORE JUNE 20TH <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Party Headquarters believes that it is responsible for assisting in the progress of the municipal government's literacy education campaign. Therefore, it has organized a Literacy Education Promotion Association, appointing Tong Xingbai as the executive director and Wang Yansong, Lin Meiyan, Lu Jingshi, and Li Suixian as directors to actively carry out the project. The public's enthusiasm has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Now, the City Party Headquarters believes that there are many societies in the city, and since these societies have the nature of serving society, they should bear the obligation of supporting public welfare. Therefore, it has specifically formulated regulations for establishing literacy schools by societies and implementation measures. Together with the City Social Bureau, these have been issued to various societies in the city, with a deadline of June 20th for opening the schools. The regulations for establishing schools have already been reported in this newspaper, so there is no need to repeat them. The instructions and implementation measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>JOINT INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>"Regarding the matter of joint instructions, literacy education is the most fundamental and essential method for promoting popular intelligence and cultural revitalization. All Chinese people should exhaust their resources and abilities to accomplish this great task. Now, when the government is actively promoting it, it is difficult to achieve the effect of joint and simultaneous prosperity without mobilizing the entire strength of society. Moreover, various societies have the nature of serving society and should bear the obligation of supporting public welfare. In view of this, the committee and bureau have jointly formulated two types of regulations: 'Regulations for Establishing Literacy Schools by Societies' and 'Implementation Measures.' In addition to issuing a general order to all subordinate societies to abide by them, attachments are being printed and issued to the association for compliance. Starting from the date of receipt of this document, preparations must be made within two weeks and reported at any time. The schools must open before June 20th, and a responsible representative must be dispatched to Shangwen Elementary School on Penglai Road at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month to listen to the report. This is essential. A copy of the 'Regulations for Establishing Literacy Schools by Societies' and a copy of the 'Implementation Measures' are enclosed."</p>
<p>IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES</p>
<p>"Implementation Measures for Establishing Literacy Schools by Societies" (Article 1) In addition to complying with the 'Regulations for Establishing Literacy Schools by Societies,' all societies establishing literacy schools shall implement this method (Article 2). Each society should establish at least one literacy school; more are better (Article 3). School sites shall be limited to the society's premises. Temples, shrines, residences, parlors, village teahouses, and ordinary school buildings may all be borrowed and used as annexes (Article 4). Students shall be limited to people in the same trade, regardless of gender or age. No tuition fees shall be charged. Two classes shall be established each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Each class must have at least 30 people; the more, the better (Article 5). The scale may be simple; it does not have to be in the form of a school. Ordinary household furniture may be used. However, a large blackboard must be provided for teaching (Article 6). Teaching time shall be determined according to the convenience of the students, and may be set in the morning, evening, or daytime. However, once it is set, it may not be changed. The teaching method may be determined at discretion, but the ultimate goal is to enable those who do not know how to read to learn to read (Article 7). In addition to teaching literacy, literacy schools must also provide common knowledge guidance and civic training, so that in addition to literacy, students can also receive intellectual enlightenment in thought and knowledge (Article 8). The teachers of literacy schools established by various societies must meet one of the following requirements: (1) Graduates of junior normal schools or junior middle schools with certificates to prove it; (2) those who have served as teachers in municipal or registered primary schools for more than one year with proof; (3) those who have been registered or tested and qualified by the Shanghai Literacy Education Association or the Literacy Education Committee; (4) those with teaching experience and approved by the Shanghai Literacy Education Association (Article 9). In addition to managing the literacy schools established by the various societies completely on their own, those who entrust the City Party Headquarters Literacy Education Promotion Association to handle them on their behalf shall pay the expenses to the City Party Headquarters Literacy Education Promotion Association at one time in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the 'Regulations for Literacy Schools of Various Groups' (Article 10). The City Party Headquarters shall send personnel to examine the performance of the literacy schools established by the various societies at any time. All schools that arrive shall be subject to the guidance of the visiting staff (Article 11). The rewards for those who have established literacy schools with excellent results are as follows: (1) Those who can establish two literacy schools, or hold two consecutive sessions, and have achieved results, will be given royal jelly (2) Those who can establish three or more literacy schools, or hold three or more consecutive sessions, and have achieved results, will be given a certificate in addition to a medal (Article 12). If the various societies are able to hold literacy schools, and the extension is still being established, the punitive measures are as follows: (1) From the date of the notice from the City Party Headquarters, two weeks later, if preparations have not yet been made, and reasons have not yet been presented, a warning shall be given (2) From the date of the warning, two weeks later, if there is still no indication of establishment, and they have not come to apply, they shall be dissolved (Article 13). This method shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the City Party Headquarters (Article 14). Matters not covered in this method shall be revised by the City Party Headquarters at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e87">CITY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SENDS OPINIONS ON THE BANKRUPTCY LAW - PRESENTS FOUR POINTS AND REQUESTS AN EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE - PUBLISHES THE ORIGINAL DRAFT IN THE "COMMERCIAL MONTHLY" <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, inquiring about opinions on the draft Bankruptcy Law. The Chamber's Industrial and Commercial Law Research Committee and Standing Committee discussed it in detail and decided to first present four points of opinion and request an extension of the deadline for soliciting opinions, which was originally set for the 10th of this month. This case is of great importance, and the deadline is too short. The Chamber requested that the deadline be extended and that the original text of the draft be published in the Chamber's "Commercial Monthly" to allow various industries to explore it. The letter of opinion is recorded below: (1) It is proposed to change "suspension of payment" in Article 1 to "total suspension of payment." (Reason) It is difficult to escape the responsibility of a debtor who is untrustworthy, delays payment, and disregards debts. However, the sequestration of assets affects all the debtor's abilities and actions. The extent to which bankruptcy should be declared should be carefully considered. This law takes the inability to pay as the cause of bankruptcy and the suspension of payment as the presumed cause of bankruptcy. From a legal point of view, a debtor's credit, property, and collateral must be lost before bankruptcy can be declared. The reason for setting the presumed cause in the law is to facilitate the determination of facts. However, the meaning of suspension of payment is too broad. It is proposed to add the two words "total" above suspension of payment to facilitate explanation and show restriction. (2) In the last two sentences of Article 2, "The court that can exercise jurisdiction in accordance with the preceding paragraph shall be the local court where the debtor or bankrupt's property is located," it is proposed to add the two words "main" before "property." (Reason) The debtor or bankrupt's property is often scattered in various places. If there is no residence or place of business, limiting the jurisdiction to the location of the main property can reduce difficulties in management. (3) It is proposed to delete the four words "unlimited liability" in Article 3, Paragraph 4. (Reason) The shareholders who execute the business of a limited partnership company are naturally unlimited liability shareholders, and this is consistent with the meaning of Paragraph 2 of the same article. (4) It is proposed to change Article 2, Paragraph 6 to "the legal representative, manager, or liquidator of the debtor or bankrupt." (Reason) According to the Company Law, the rights and obligations of the liquidator of a limited company are the same as those of the director and can naturally be regarded as the legal representative of the company. However, the law does not explicitly stipulate that the liquidator of a partnership or other type of company is the legal representative. Therefore, it is better to add the term "liquidator" to make it clearer. (5) According to the above provisions of Article 4, "For those established abroad or declared bankrupt abroad, it shall not be effective for the debtor's or bankrupt's property in China." If a Chinese merchant in Hong Kong has branches in both Guangdong and Shanghai, and the Hong Kong head office is unable to pay its debts, the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce may negotiate a settlement. However, because of the above restrictions, it will not be possible to dispose of the property in Guangdong and Shanghai. To protect their rights, creditors in Guangdong and Shanghai will inevitably seek reconciliation from the courts or chambers of commerce in the location. Therefore, one case is handled in several places, which is costly and does not benefit either creditors or debtors. It is proposed to set an exception clause in this article as follows: "However, if the location of the main business is abroad, and the local chamber of commerce has completed the reconciliation procedures, creditors in the Mainland may apply for a merged reconciliation (explanation)." The proviso shall also include court conciliation and bankruptcy declaration to prevent foreign courts from interfering with the property in the Mainland for enforcement issues. In addition, the Chamber still has something to contribute: This law does not list the order of priority for bankruptcy claims, except for setting separate provisions for secured claims and co-ownership rights and recognizing the existence of priority rights. For example, in the old draft Article 28, the medical expenses of physicians, pharmacists, midwives, and nurses used by the bankrupt within one year before the bankruptcy declaration, and the wages of workers and servants employed by the bankrupt within one year before the bankruptcy declaration, were listed prior to all other claims. From the perspective of social interest, should this law adopt this provision? Please consider this carefully by the legislative authorities.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, according to financial sources in this city, Fujian Province issued 8 million yuan in provincial public bonds, with 5 million yuan to be used to settle old debts and 3 million yuan to be used for local construction. The principal and interest repayment fund for the public bonds is guaranteed by the revenue from business tax and tobacco and alcohol tax throughout the province. The issuance has been approved by the central government. Last month, Xu Fu, the director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance, personally came to Shanghai to negotiate the underwriting and mortgage methods with the financial community in this city. After consultation, the syndicate in this city has agreed to mortgage half of the amount to meet the needs. According to a spokesperson for the Bank of Communications in this city, the Luoxingta Pagoda Wharf in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, is of great importance to the province's transportation. However, it has been in disrepair for years and is in a dangerous state, urgently requiring repairs. The Provincial Department of Construction has borrowed 210,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications to fund the repairs. A loan agreement has been signed, with the Provincial Dredging Bureau repaying 3,500 yuan per month, with the aim of repaying the loan in seven years.</p>
<h3 id="e89">RICE MERCHANTS RESIST SIAMESE RICE <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, since the incident of Siamese discrimination and mistreatment of overseas Chinese occurred, all sectors of the country have expressed indignation. Rice merchants have taken action to resist Siamese rice. According to a source in the rice industry in this city, the Mixed Grain Industry Association has announced its decision to resist Siamese rice and has telegraphed the central government to negotiate. Rice merchants deeply sympathize with this and will immediately implement a boycott of Siamese rice. Siam has a large trade surplus with China, with rice and grains accounting for the majority of its exports to China. A boycott of Siamese rice will be very effective. Due to last year's drought, rice merchants in this city ordered a large quantity of foreign rice, but it was all from Saigon and Xiaojiao. They then ordered over 700,000 bags of Siamese rice. Siamese rice is of superior quality but expensive, so its sales are not as smooth as Saigon and Xiaojiao rice. Recently, a batch of Dajiao rice arrived, and because of its low price, it met the needs of the time and was sold out in an instant. Siamese rice, on the other hand, is more sluggish. Therefore, rice merchants have no problem resisting Siamese rice. Now that the Mixed Grain Guild has made a decision, rice merchants will stop ordering Siamese rice from today. As for the over 700,000 bags of Siamese rice that were previously ordered, only over 400,000 bags have arrived in China. There is no plan yet for the 300,000 bags that are still arriving in China.</p>

<p>In order to encourage domestic products and seize the international market, the Ministry of Finance has decided to reduce export taxes to promote them. According to reliable sources from the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect domestic industry and commerce and prevent the dumping of foreign goods, the Ministry of Finance has decided to increase import taxes to compensate for the loss of reducing export taxes and exempting transit taxes. It is also rumored that the increase in import taxes will be implemented at the same time as the reduction in export taxes and the exemption of transit taxes. The tax rates are currently being revised and will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review in the coming days. If it is not implemented by June 1, it will be postponed to July 1.</p>
<h3 id="e92">JIANGSU PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PROCLAIMS - STRICTLY PROHIBITS FISHING BOATS FROM SMUGGLING - WU SONGKOU AND OTHER PLACES ARE THE INSPECTION LOCATIONS - LIU HE QI YA KOU AND OTHERS ARE THE RE-INSPECTION LOCATIONS <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued a proclamation, stating: "According to the Ministry of Finance, Supervision No. 10073, the Supervisory Office submitted a report stating that from Qingming onwards each year, it is the time to handle the yellow croaker fishing season. In previous years, it was ordered that Xiangjiang Port, Qigang Yu, Qidong's Yongchang Town, and Wusongkou be used as inspection locations, while Liuhe, Luyuan, Jiangyin, Fushan, Hupu, Fuqiao, and Liuhe's Qiyakou were used as re-inspection locations. The Tax Police Bureau should be instructed to follow the previous year's precedent and order each district team to comply with the new regulations and handle the matter carefully. At the same time, the Songjiang Branch shall select fishing gear inspectors to be stationed in various places to conduct strict inspections and strive for thoroughness. However, coastal fishing boats often smuggle contraband under the guise of salting, and some even collude with large groups of smugglers, relying on their numbers to resist inspection, causing trouble. This not only affects tax revenue but also hinders public security. If preventive measures are not taken in advance, applying for a proclamation following the case is insufficient to deter them. In addition to ordering the Tax Police Bureau to supervise the district team and fully take responsibility for handling the matter, we should prepare a document and request the Supervisory Office to follow the precedent and reissue the proclamation for posting to strictly prohibit smuggling, etc. Accordingly, a notice is hereby issued to all fishing boat personnel to be informed and comply with the regulations, wear the monitoring badge, and wait for inspection. Do not take the opportunity to smuggle or rely on the crowd to break through. If the aforementioned circumstances occur, strict investigation will be conducted according to the law, and there will be no leniency. Anti-smuggling officers and soldiers must also not take the opportunity to harass. They must all be respectful and not reach this point. This is essential."</p>

<h3 id="e100">The City Social Affairs Bureau Formulates a Plan for Agricultural Cooperative Experimentation, Which Has Been Approved by the Municipal Government, Significantly Aiding Rural Revitalization <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau noted that last year's drought caused agricultural disasters and poor harvests. However, the agricultural cooperative experiment zones in the city maintained their production performance. Records show that the production volume in these zones was higher than that of ordinary cultivation methods. If this can be promoted citywide, allowing all farmers to imitate the methods of the agricultural cooperative experiment zones, selecting improved varieties, and improving techniques, then the agricultural production in this city will certainly see remarkable progress. This will significantly aid rural revitalization. With the current spring plowing season, the agricultural cooperative experimentation should be carried out to achieve the full success of agricultural improvement. The bureau has formulated a plan for the agricultural cooperative experiment zones in the 24th year, following established precedents, and it has been approved by the municipal government. The plan and an overview of last year's agricultural cooperative experiment zones are recorded below:</p>
<p>Formulated Plan</p>
<p>(1) Locations: In addition to the ten districts of Lihang, Yangsi, Tangqiao, Caojing, Yinhang, Gaohang, Zhenru, Jiangwan, Pengpu, Fahua, Yangjing, Wusong, and Pusong, which should continue to be operated to achieve results, Gaohang and Yinxiang districts will also be added to expand coverage. (2) Organization: The bureau will entrust municipal committee members and agricultural associations in each district to select excellent local farmers and establish zones in suitable locations, with farmers responsible for management and subject to the guidance and supervision of the bureau, municipal committee members, and agricultural associations. A non-salaried instructor may be hired as needed. (3) Facilities: This year will still focus on cotton experimentation. Twelve zones will be set up in Lihang, Yinhang, Yangsi, Tangqiao, and Caojing, divided into two districts each, while the remaining ten districts will each have six zones, totaling one hundred and twenty zones. (4) Subsidies: Each zone will have a designated area of five mu (Chinese acres), with a subsidy of three yuan per mu for experimentation costs. Each district will receive 45 yuan for instructor travel expenses and 15 yuan for seed costs.</p>
<p>Last Year's Overview</p>
<p>Last year, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau designated thirteen districts, including Yangsi, Lihang, Yinhang, Fahua, Pusong, Jiangwan, Pengpu, Tangqiao, Zhenru, Gaohang, Yangjing, Caojing, and Wusong, as agricultural cooperative experiment zones. It ordered municipal committee members and agricultural associations in each district to select excellent farmers and instructors and proceed according to the agricultural cooperative plan set by the bureau. It also formulated a chart of cotton cultivation procedures and diary forms, which were issued to each district for compliance. The bureau sent personnel from time to time to inspect and urge the instructors and cooperative farmers in each district to carry out the plan diligently. After each district reported the experimental situation to the bureau, it was found that several zones were severely affected by drought due to the terrain, and the production results were slightly lower. However, the rest were diligent in irrigation, cultivated properly, and had abundant harvests, which were higher than those of ordinary cultivation methods, so they were deeply trusted by the farmers. The bureau selected and rewarded those with excellent results to show encouragement. The overview of the city's agricultural cooperative experiment zones in the 23rd year is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Production Situation</p>
<p>1.  Yangsi District: A total of 18 zones, covering 90 mu, planted Jiangyin White Seed Cotton and harvested 9,660 jin. 2. Lihang District: A total of 18 zones, covering 90 mu, planted Jiangyin White Seed Cotton and harvested 15,293 jin. 3.

<p>The Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway always transports a large volume of tea and cocoons when they come on the market each season. Therefore, the railway's traffic department pays close attention to this, reducing freight rates and assigning special personnel to each station to solicit business and provide care. The railway police department, fearing that the existing railway police force on each section would be insufficient, has ordered student police from the two railway training institutes to be dispatched to each section on a rotating basis to protect the merchants' goods. It has been learned that due to the weather, both this year's tea and spring cocoons have come on the market earlier. Hui Tong Transportation Company has been reporting daily shipments of tea to Shanghai from Zhakou Station, with over 4,000 boxes already transported. The first batch of spring cocoons, consisting of over 300 packages, also arrived yesterday from Gongchen and Chang'an stations in two shipments. They are currently being transported. Therefore, the railway bureau has been handling a large volume of imported goods such as tea and cocoons, as well as exported goods such as rice and materials such as railroad ties and steel rails for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Division of Municipal and County Public Property; Objections Arise Regarding Part of the Tianhou Palace; Evaluation Meeting Scheduled for May 16 <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The case of dividing the accumulated grain funds, properties, and original public suspected public properties between the Shanghai Municipality and Shanghai County has been submitted by both parties to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review based on the public property division method proposed by the Second Evaluation Committee (the division method was previously reported). The Municipal Finance Bureau has now received instructions from the Municipal Government, stating that the submitted reports and diagrams have been reviewed. The Tianhou Palace building base (i.e., the Municipal Shuji Elementary School) to be divided to the Municipal side was already handled in November of the 21st year by the Municipal Education Bureau and the Shanghai County Government based on the provisions regarding education in the fifth case of the meeting record of the Provincial and Municipal Division of Governing Authority Conference. A method was formulated, stating that it had been included in the previously established method. The first item stated that the County Education Bureau should transfer it to the Municipal Education Bureau along with the deed. When the County Education Bureau transferred the education properties in February of the 22nd year, it was also included in the transfer list (the list referred to it as a deedless base and a copy of the list was sent to the Finance Bureau for the record). Therefore, the property rights had long been determined, and it could no longer be included in the scope of the municipal and county division. The Tianhou Palace building base should be removed, and another division method should be proposed for review. The Municipal and County public property building base should be investigated for existing funds and reported accordingly. The bureau has scheduled a third evaluation committee meeting for 2:00 PM on May 16 to discuss the division plan. However, after receiving the Municipal Finance Bureau's letter, the County Government found that the former County Third Elementary School (i.e., the current Municipal Shuji Elementary School) borrowed a portion of the Tianhou Palace as a school building. The County Public Funds and Properties Management Office found that the County Education Bureau published an educational overview, stating that the Municipal and County Division of Education Properties declared that the Shanghai County Third Higher Elementary School, located at Tianhou Palace on Henan Road, covering 3.8 mu of land, had no deed and was transferred to the Municipal Education Bureau for receipt. The office believed that since the Shuji Elementary School was reorganized from the County Third Elementary School, the transfer of jurisdiction should be limited to educational administration, and the land should still belong to the original public property. The Education Bureau's transfer to the Municipal side should not be tacitly approved. In December of last year, it was found that the County Third Elementary School (i.e., the current Municipal Shuji Elementary School) borrowed the Tianhou Palace public property. The office sent a letter to the County Education Bureau to forward to the Municipal Education Bureau, stating its objection. Yesterday, letters were sent to county committee members Qin Yanqi, Wang Yunseng, Zhang Jingye, Zhu Changlin, Wang Chengyao, and Zhang Guangrong, requesting them to investigate and attend the meeting, and to unanimously advocate that the Tianhou Palace should still belong to the original public property according to the original case declared by the Funds and Properties Office last year and be divided accordingly.</p>

<p>The Temporary Preparatory Office for the Establishment of a Chiang Kai-shek Statue by All Circles in Shanghai has decided to build a Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall after accepting Mayor Wu's opinion. After negotiations with the Municipal Party Headquarters are finalized, a promoters' meeting will be scheduled. The office issued its third announcement yesterday, stating, "Regarding the announcement, the preparatory office has been in operation for three months, and has been enthusiastically supported by all circles to participate as promoters. As of the 11th of this month, there are 117 groups and 101 individuals, which demonstrates the will of the people. Now that the initial stage is complete, we should proceed vigorously, but we must be cautious to avoid any errors. After several meetings and letters with Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Yang of the National Government Military Affairs Committee Chairman's Headquarters, we sent responsible representatives on the 9th to discuss the final details with Mayor Wu. However, Mayor Wu suggested that it would be more appropriate to build a memorial hall instead of a bronze statue. The office decided to accept this suggestion and prepare to submit it to the promoters' meeting for formal approval to show solemnity. As for the date of the meeting, it has not yet been decided because it is still necessary to negotiate with the Party Headquarters and other parties. Once there is a date, it will be announced in the newspaper and notified by letter. The reasons for the delay in convening the meeting and a brief overview of the preparations are hereby announced to the promoting groups and promoters for their information. This announcement is made."</p>

<p>The group wedding organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was originally scheduled to be held on the first Wednesday of each month. The bureau has decided to change it to five times a year after considering the customs of civil weddings and the fact that few people get married in the hot summer months. A plan was drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and public announcement. The fourth group wedding this year has been changed to October. However, the revised method has caused those who wanted to participate in the fourth session to be unable to do so. Therefore, the registration for the second session has been extended to next Wednesday (the 15th). There are currently more than 40 participating couples. It is expected that the number of new couples participating will be enthusiastic due to the extension, and may exceed the first session. The grandeur of the ceremony will definitely be more advanced than the first two sessions. It is also heard that the bureau is scheduled to hold a wedding rehearsal on June 4.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Chuansha County Requests Prohibition; Foreigners in Shanghai Should Not Hunt; To Ensure Safety <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government approved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' response regarding Chuansha County's request to negotiate with foreign consulates in Shanghai to notify foreigners not to hunt or stay overnight in the coastal areas of the county to ensure safety. It specially instructed the administrative inspectors of each district and the county magistrates of each county, the director of the public security bureau of the provincial capital, etc., stating that the Chuansha County Magistrate Li Leng had previously requested that foreign consulates in Shanghai be negotiated with so that foreigners would not hunt or stay overnight in the coastal areas of the county to ensure safety. Because this matter concerned foreign affairs, instructions were issued and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was consulted for review. Now, the reply has been approved, stating that there are no provisions regarding hunting matters in the treaty, but hunting is not within the meaning of "travel" in the treaty. The former Prime Minister's Office had an explanation on record. Currently, foreigners hunting in China are handled according to the Hunting Law of the Third Year of the Republic and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Hunting Law of the Tenth Year of the Republic. According to Article 8 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Hunting Law of the Tenth Year of the Republic, when issuing a Class B hunting certificate, the local government of the hunting area should be consulted first to obtain their opinion, and the government should be notified after the certificate is issued for inspection. If the Chuansha area believes that it is necessary to ban foreigners from hunting, it may, according to the provisions of Article 8 of the aforementioned Detailed Rules for Implementation, state the reasons why it is not convenient to allow foreigners to hunt when the issuing authority solicits opinions in writing. Having approved the report, in addition to the Ministry informing the Ministry of Industry to order the competent authorities in each province and city to strictly follow the provisions of the Hunting Law of the Third Year of the Republic and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Hunting Law of the Tenth Year of the Republic when issuing hunting certificates to foreigners in the future, and to indicate the permitted hunting locations on the certificate. If the permitted location is in the interior, it should also be stated that the certificate holder must still apply for an inland travel passport when going to that location. After the reply arrives, it will be reported separately. Appropriate consultation and notification are required. This order is issued for notification.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Zhang Sumin Lectures on Modern Economic Thought <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Fudan University specially invited economist Dr. Zhang Sumin to lecture on "Modern Economic Thought." Professor Li Binghuan, head of the university's economics department, gave an introduction. Dr. Zhang then began his lecture, stating that the word "modern" has two meanings. One is narrow, referring to the most recent period, roughly from 1900 to the present. Economic thought during this period is so recent and diverse that it is difficult to categorize into schools. If forced, it could be divided into as many as ninety schools, such as the Price School, Happiness School, Quantity School, Mathematical School, Legal School, Socio-economic School, Experimental Economic School, Functional Economic School, Institutional Economic School, and Controlled Economic School. However, these schools are interconnected, and many individuals belong to several schools simultaneously. Therefore, recent economic thought can only be described in terms of trends, not schools. Thus, we can say that the trends of modern economic thought emphasize quantitative methods, experimental methods, price research, people's happiness, social stance, legal institutions, and government control. The second meaning of "modern" is broad, referring to the modern era in general, starting from the publication of Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations" in 1776. If we consider the period from 1776 to 1900 as one era, the schools of thought during this period, besides Socialism, include the Classical School, Nationalist School, Historical School, Optimist School, Austrian School, and Neo-classical School. If we group the Classical School, Optimist School, Austrian School, and Neo-classical School into the Liberal School, then the economic thought of this period includes the Liberal School, Socialist School, Nationalist School, and Historical School. If we summarize the economic thought since 1900 into two or three schools (such as the Mathematical School, Institutional School, and Controlled School), then there are perhaps six or seven major schools of economic thought from 1776 to the present. In short, the division of schools is somewhat arbitrary. However, some believe that besides the Socialist School, there is only the Liberal School in modern economic thought, which does not align with the facts. Moreover, liberalism (i.e., laissez-faire policy) died in fact in the mid-19th century and in thought at the beginning of this century, which is something we should pay particular attention to.</p>

(2) The 1934 profit distribution plan was approved. (3) On the capital expansion plan, the chairman first reported that the company, due to business development, plans to increase capital by one million yuan. The directors and supervisors have already committed to raising half of this amount, and the remaining 500,000 yuan will be offered to existing shareholders. If there is a shortfall, it will be raised from outside sources. A vote was then taken, and it was unanimously approved. The shareholders also proposed that all official dividends from 1934 be converted into capital stock first, and that all shareholders be encouraged to subscribe for shares enthusiastically. This was fully supported and approved. (4) The amendment of the articles of association was approved. The shareholders had no objections to changing the par value from 100 yuan to 10 yuan per share. However, there were slight opinions on the wording, which were discussed and revised one by one. Supervisors were then elected, and Zhu Yinjiang, Liang Ziyuan, and Zhang Rongpu were elected. Wang Xiaolai, Xu Xinliu, and Hao YunChu were the next three highest vote-getters. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The company distributed toys and other products as souvenirs to add to the enjoyment. The shareholders were quite excited about the company's thriving business and generous profits.</p>

<p>The famous Yantai Tiantian Cigarette Factory and Yantai Changyu Winery in North China both have a long history and reputation. They are the most well-equipped and produce the highest quality wines in the country. This year, they have hired the best winemaking technicians to refine their products. The color, aroma, and taste are all excellent, making them outstanding among domestic goods and even surpassing imported products. However, the beverage market in the southern provinces has always been dominated by foreign goods, with astonishing quantities. Therefore, the Shanghai Anshen Enterprise Company has been specially engaged to fully develop the South China business. All provinces along the Longhai Railway and south of it can order or negotiate distribution from the company. At the beginning of this summer, beer and brandy are essential sanitary beverage products. Now, Yantai beer and Changyu brandy, which are of good quality and low price, are rising to replace imported products. Patriotic compatriots will surely warmly welcome them. From now on, the South China beverage market will see the activity of these two Yantai Changyu wineries.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Gale in the City Yesterday Morning; Trees Uprooted in Zhenjiang, Delaying the Shanghai-Nanjing Train; Incoming Ships Delayed; Weather Turned Cool Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00 AM yesterday, when the city was still in the quiet of the night, a sudden gale swept in. People in Shanghai were sleeping soundly when their windows were blown open. The wind lasted for two hours before subsiding, causing delays for incoming ships yesterday morning. Telephone and telegraph lines were also slightly damaged. Many large trees at the Shanjingkou in Zhenjiang were uprooted and fell on the tracks, delaying the Shanghai-Nanjing train and the Shanghai-Pinghu train from Nanjing by two hours this morning. The weather also turned cooler yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation of the Gale Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The weather had been sultry for days, reaching ninety-one degrees at noon the day before yesterday. Although it cooled down slightly at night, it was still sultry. Many residents, unable to bear it, left their windows open when they went to sleep. However, at 2:00 AM (i.e., yesterday morning), the weather suddenly turned cold, like late autumn. At 3:00 AM, a gale roared in. Most people, at this late hour, were awakened from their sound sleep and felt the discomfort of the early morning cold. The wind subsided slightly at 5:00 AM. The lowest temperature last night was about seventy degrees.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing Train Delayed</p>
<p>The gale extended to the coast and along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The situation was particularly severe in Zhenjiang, where many large trees at Shanjingkou were uprooted and fell on the tracks, preventing the Shanghai-Nanjing train from Nanjing and the Shanghai-Pinghu train from passing. After railway workers removed the trees, traffic could resume, but the trains were delayed by two hours. The Shanghai-Nanjing train arrived at 9:30 AM (originally scheduled for 7:15 AM), and the Shanghai-Pinghu train arrived at 10:00 AM (originally scheduled for 8:00 AM). However, the train cars and passengers were not otherwise affected.</p>
<p>Incoming Ships Delayed</p>
<p>Due to the gale yesterday morning, many ships originally scheduled to arrive were delayed by several hours. These included ships from China Merchants and Taikoo. However, ships scheduled to depart yesterday, such as the Jiangxin from China Merchants, the Dayu from Dada, and the Hongda from Dalian, departed as scheduled. In addition, many of the city's telegraph and long-distance telephone lines were damaged by the wind, but they have now been repaired.</p>
<p>Weather Cooler Yesterday</p>
<p>The weather had been quite hot recently, reaching 94.5 degrees on the 10th and 91 degrees the day before yesterday. At 9:00 AM yesterday, it was 70 degrees, and at noon it was only 77 degrees, much cooler than the previous two days. However, the weather has been alternately cold and hot recently, which can easily lead to illness.</p>
<p>The gale passed through yesterday morning, and the telegraph and telephone lines along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway were also disrupted. At the Lucheng Station, a 21-ton flatcar parked on a siding was blown and moved automatically for more than one station. A locomotive was dispatched from Changzhou Station and towed the car back near the Xinzha Station. At the Qishuyan Station, a 30-ton flatcar from the Jinpu Railway parked on a siding was also blown and moved automatically, breaking the iron yoke, causing two wheels to derail. In addition, the 301 through train and the 5 night express from Nanjing the night before last were also delayed by two or three hours due to the hurricane.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Mother's Day Commemorated Yesterday; Wu Xingya Speaks at the Women's Temperance Society; the U.S. Navy YMCA Also Holds Celebrations <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was World Mother's Day. The Shanghai Chinese Women's Temperance Society held a commemorative meeting at its headquarters on Yuanmingyuan Road at 3:00 PM, attended by more than a hundred representatives from all walks of life, as well as mothers and children. An oath-taking ceremony was held. The U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai and the U.S. Navy YMCA also held celebrations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Representatives At 3:00 PM yesterday, the Women's Temperance Society held a Mother's Day commemorative meeting. Attendees included Social Bureau Director Wu Xingya, Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, and women's leaders Wu Laowei, Liu Wang Liming, Chen Lingyi, Yang Zhihao, as well as mothers and children, totaling more than one hundred people.</p>
<p>Oath-Taking Ceremony After the ceremony, Ms. Wu Laowei led the representatives in taking the oath. The oath read: "I hereby solemnly swear to abide by the precepts of the Chinese Women's Temperance Society, to honor our mothers, to promote maternal love, and to strive for social service." This oath was taken on May 12, 1935. There was also a three-minute moment of silence to recall the love of our mothers from childhood to adulthood and to show respect.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Wu Laowei then gave a speech, stating that World Mother's Day originated at the end of the European War and was initiated by Ms. Anna Jarvis of the United States. All countries in the world have also vigorously promoted it, and it has become Mother's Day for all nations and peoples. If people have no parents, how can they survive? Therefore, I hope you will not take it lightly. Although the site of this association is small and the ceremony is simple, its mission is extremely serious and upright. We are very honored to have you all present today. From now on, we should follow the oath we took today, promote maternal love, and strive for social service, so as not to fail the meaning of commemorating Mother's Day.</p>
<p>Wu Xingya's Speech Wu Xingya then gave a speech, stating that mothers are the greatest people in the world and the people who love us the most. From birth to now, I have never been separated from my mother. Mothers nurture me, guide me, and make us members of society. Therefore, we should commemorate mothers. As for making the country strong and the people healthy, we should first think about the mothers. Healthy mothers mean lively and innocent children. Therefore, mothers taking care of their bodies indirectly means taking care of their children. Now, Chinese women should first seek liberation so that the future little masters of our country can thrive day by day. Conversely, if women do not seek liberation, the children they bear will not be healthy. This point should be discussed. Furthermore, if we want to love the country, love society, and serve the people, we should first love our own mothers, because mothers can teach you to grow up, contribute to the country, serve society, and work for the people. These are all the meanings of commemorating Mother's Day. Please remember them well. Afterwards, the participating elementary school students performed songs and dances, which were quite wonderful. Finally, child representatives presented flowers and refreshments, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>American Celebrations The U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai and the U.S. Navy YMCA held separate commemorative ceremonies. The Marine Corps and others gathered at the Grand Theatre at 10:00 AM yesterday for the ceremony. A committee headed by Mrs. Pannell presented each participating sailor with a small bouquet of flowers. The person representing the mothers to accept the flowers from the sailors was Mrs. Pannell, the wife of Marine Corps Sergeant Pannell. During the ceremony, the band played music and sang, which was very moving. Finally, Reverend Forbes gave a speech on "Mother and Child." After the ceremony, two hundred American soldiers who participated in the ceremony were invited to various homes by American expatriates in Shanghai for a meal. Catholic members invited seventy-five sailors to their homes, with each family hosting about two to ten sailors. In the evening, fifty American women jointly hosted the American soldiers at the Navy YMCA.</p>
<p>Grand Teaching Scene Yesterday was Sunday. The Moore Memorial Church held a Mother's Day prayer service at 10:30 AM, led by Reverend Ye Fang. Students from the Moore Memorial Girls' School sang special hymns. The church presented each male and female guest who attended the service with a bouquet of flowers. White flowers were given to those whose parents had passed away, red flowers were given to those whose parents were alive, and one red and one white flower were given to those with one parent alive and one deceased. The flowers were beautiful and touching. The church also presented two Chinese and Western Mother's Day flower baskets to show respect.</p>
<p>Newspaper Commemorations Because yesterday was Mother's Day, all the newspapers in the city devoted space to publish commemorative articles. The International Council of Women, organized by sixteen women's groups representing fourteen countries, has been established for several years. The council held its annual general meeting at the American Women's Association on Jingan Temple Road yesterday, and discussions will continue today. The main proposal this time is "The Establishment of Vocational Education Institutions for Young Women in Shanghai."</p>

<h3 id="e117">International Telecommunications Bureau Calibrates International Call Equipment; Tests Lines and Sounding Accuracy; First Talking to the U.S. and the Philippines, Then Gradually Developing <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications' International Telecommunications Bureau began actively planning domestic and international wireless telephone services last year, the wireless telephone equipment at the radio station has been installed by the end of last month. Currently, engineers from the station are testing the lines to ensure they are correct and the sound is clear. Once the calibration is complete, test calls will first be made with various countries. If the results are good, formal calls will then begin on a regular basis with the United States and the Philippines, with whom agreements have already been reached. After telephone service with the U.S. and the Philippines is implemented, it will continue to work with Germany, France, Italy, and other countries. As for the call charges, in addition to the regulations of international call rates, connecting fees and other expenses will need to be determined separately. The Ministry of Communications is currently drafting these regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Japanese Oil Dumped at Low Prices; Sales Not Strong; 2,000 Boxes Remain in Storage for Sale; Several Thousand More Boxes to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Japanese Petroleum Corporation named the oil produced in Fushun, Northeast China, "Chengmen" brand and shipped the first batch of 5,000 boxes to Shanghai for trial sales. The Shanghai agency of the Japanese Petroleum Corporation, Yinghua Foreign Firm, was responsible for promoting the sales. Because this batch of goods was less efficient than British, American, and Russian oil, sales were not strong. Yinghua then dumped the oil at low prices to compete with British, American, and Russian oil merchants. The facts over the past half month have shown that this is impossible. According to inquiries, of the 5,000 boxes, only about 3,000 boxes were purchased or retailed by Japanese residents. There are still 2,000 boxes in storage for sale. Very few Chinese people have purchased the oil. According to Yinghua, several thousand more boxes will be shipped to Shanghai later this month.</p>

<p>The Industrial Materials Testing Institute, built by the Chinese Institute of Engineers in the city center, has been fully completed. All decoration and equipment will also be completed soon. The purpose of the institute's construction is to improve China's engineering industry and conduct detailed practical research. The current completion is the first phase of the plan. The building and equipment materials were mostly donated by various manufacturers. It is said that the opening ceremony will be held next month. The second and third phases of the plan will then be gradually implemented to achieve perfection.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Joint Committee, etc., Requests Investigation of Telephone Company's Accounts; If Expenses Are Not Covered, Efforts Should Be Made to Economize; Why Repeatedly Raise Prices and Increase the Burden on Users? <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since the British and French concessions approved the Shanghai Telephone Company's illegal price increase, all sectors of industry, commerce, and education in the city have expressed dissent due to the economic depression of all industries. The Joint Committee of Machine-Made National Goods Factories yesterday specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the government to thoroughly investigate the company's accounts. The original text reads: "Submitted regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's repeated increases in telephone fees, earnestly requesting negotiations to stop the increases in order to relieve the burden on users. Shanghai is a major trading port, and its prosperity in industry and commerce is the highest in the country. However, since the Shanghai War, foreign economic aggression has crowded out domestic industries, and last year's drought caused rural bankruptcy, causing the entire Shanghai market to be depressed. Bankruptcies are frequently heard. The telephone company previously increased prices in 1932, and soon after, proposed to calculate telephone fees by the number of calls. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department even proposed to increase prices by 12.5%. However, it is known that telephones are a public utility, and according to international practice, profits should be reduced. However, the company stubbornly insists on maintaining a certain profit, which is inappropriate. Moreover, in the two months before the price increase, according to surveys, 2,500 telephone lines had already been removed. If the fees are calculated by the number of calls, according to the statistics of a neighborhood association (published in Shen Xin and other newspapers on April 9), the charges would exceed the original charges by three to four times. How can users bear this burden? It is known that more people will remove their lines. In addition, the price of silver has risen sharply recently, and the exchange rate is low, reducing the company's import costs and invisibly increasing its profits. If expenses are not covered, efforts should be made to economize. It is not appropriate to repeatedly seek compensation from users. Otherwise, if the company disregards market conditions and insists on raising prices, the accounts of the public utility should be submitted to public examination by citizens in order to be fair. Therefore, we specially submit this request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to approve and negotiate a halt to the price increase, or send a letter to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to jointly investigate the accounts in order to clarify the facts and relieve the people's difficulties. This is for the public good."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Drainage Ditch in the French Concession Hinders Drinking Water for Chinese Residents; Representatives Elected to Petition and Negotiate <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The excavation of drainage ditches by the French at Tianyaoqiao and Puhuitangba West in Xuhui, Shanghai, hinders the drinking water of Chinese residents along dozens of miles of the canal. Representatives from the three counties of Shanghai, Songjiang, and Qingpu have repeatedly discussed relief measures. Recently, Yang Xinmin, Li Qixian, Wang Jingzhi, and others were elected to submit a document to the municipal government, requesting that they quickly negotiate with the French authorities to move the ditch east of the dam to achieve the purpose of relief. It is also heard that the representatives said that when the Puhuitang was dredged this year, Song Ziwen, chairman of the former Songhu War Zone Relief Association, was considerate of the people's suffering and allocated funds to supervise the dredging. Remembering the source of drinking water and not forgetting the virtue of eating, the residents of the area initiated a collection of funds to prepare for the construction of a pavilion and the erection of a monument for commemoration. They have been proceeding separately in recent days and have decided to select a site for construction in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Dental Association Holds Spring General Meeting Yesterday; Publishes Monthly Magazine with Standardized Dental Treatment Records; Standardizes Disease Tooth Names; Expands Hygiene Promotion Campaign <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dental Association held its spring general meeting yesterday (date omitted) at 3:00 PM on the ninth floor of the YMCA. The reporter from the *Shen Shi* newspaper will report on the details below:</p>
<p>Members present included Sun Xiamin, Shen Yinzhou, Huang Rende, Xu Yongfu, Tu Rongchu, Yan Dazhi, Shao Weichen, He Zhenyang, Zhang Xiaoqian, Wang Xiaochu, Xie Yingshen, [Name Omitted], Yan Dasheng, Qin Shao, Dong Zhaoliang, Mao Zhixiang, He Ruisheng, [Name Omitted] (representative from the Health Bureau), Shou Yun (representative from the Municipal Party Committee), Zhu Xietang, Le Xiuye, Chen Weiqing, and over twenty others. Mao Zhixiang presided over the meeting, with Yan Dazhi serving as the recording secretary. Formal procedures were followed.</p>
<p>The Chairman reported that since the establishment of the association at last year's general meeting, several tasks have been accomplished. The first matter involved the establishment of the Dental Academic Association which held a public lecture at the YMCA. Though the event lasted only one day, the effects were quite good. The second matter involved the creation of a monthly dental magazine, dedicated to collaborative research among our members and discussion of association affairs. Recently, a newspaper report mentioned Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's directive that all dental practitioners must undergo rigorous training and experience. This is a significant matter, bringing importance to the dental profession in society. In my opinion, all of our members, when using signage, whether or not using Western languages, should ensure their actual abilities and experience match. At the same time, the Medical Association has similar proposals and reforms. This is fortunate for the medical community.</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Committee representative, Mao Yun, delivered a speech, "I am exceptionally honored to participate in your association's general meeting. Your association is a free professional organization with direct or indirect major connections to the happiness of society and mankind. Your association can improve members' knowledge and strive for the safety of patients and is worthy of commendation. However, in my humble opinion, in addition to increasing knowledge and striving for the safety of patients, it is particularly necessary to strive for the progress of the entire nation's happiness. Since the revolution, in all undertakings, the government has focused on transformation and construction. However, in recent years, facing both internal and external problems, the government has exerted all its efforts to ensure the security and revival of the nation and its people, both domestically and internationally. I sincerely hope that your association will strive for hygiene campaigns. Disease can affect any person, regardless of poverty or wealth. To prevent the invasion of disease, it is necessary to prevent it in advance. As the old saying goes, 'Disease enters through the mouth.' Therefore, oral hygiene is a matter of utmost urgency. Hence, your association should make every effort to expand oral hygiene campaigns so that the entire population has basic oral hygiene knowledge, thereby reducing people's illnesses and improving the health of the nation. Indeed, only with a healthy body can there be a healthy career, and only with a healthy career can there be a healthy nation. Your association is the only dental association in the country. Especially in this early era of oral hygiene, the people have high hopes for your association. I hope your association regards the happiness of all mankind as its happiness, not just the happiness of individuals."</p>

<h3 id="e123">Gale Strikes Shanghai; House Collapses in Pudong, Injuring People; Decayed Houses Are No Match for Storms; Eight People Injured, None Seriously <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>A house collapse occurred on Yihua Road, Lanni Ferry, Pudong at approximately 8:30 AM yesterday. Nine buildings collapsed, injuring eight people of all ages. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Nine Buildings Collapsed: The collapsed houses are from No. 132 Yihua Road to No. 148, all even-numbered addresses, a total of nine buildings. These were built by the foreign firm Jardine Matheson during the late Qing Dynasty. After more than thirty years, the buildings are dilapidated. Most of the tenants are from Anhui and Hubei provinces. Last summer, because the firm did not intend to manage the properties, a negotiator persuaded the Hongsheng Zhan real estate department to purchase the land and buildings. The transfer was completed in November.</p>
<p>Refugees Occupy: After Hongsheng acquired the property rights, seeing that the houses were in dangerous condition, it notified the tenants to stop paying rent and vacate the premises to allow for reconstruction. While the tenants had not yet completely moved out, a fence was erected. Suddenly, a large number of refugees from other provinces fleeing famine arrived in Pudong. For a time, they had nowhere to live and lodged in the empty houses. At most, there were about 200 people. During the day, they relied on begging to survive. Because the refugees were not managed, most of them privately dug up wall bricks and column foundations to build houses elsewhere, gradually moving out. Until recently, there were over twenty injured refugees in the empty houses.</p>
<p>Hurricane Causes Collapse: After the empty houses were excavated by refugees, they gradually became shaky and on the verge of collapse. In addition, a hurricane suddenly struck Shanghai at about 2:00 AM yesterday morning. The houses were excessively shaken and became even more difficult to support. By 8:30 AM, with a series of crashing sounds, all nine buildings completely collapsed to the west in an instant. There were loud cries and wails. Those who could escape fled, and those who were crushed were trapped. The tragic cries for help were endless.</p>
<p>Eight People Injured: After the tragic incident occurred, the loud noise resonated far and wide. Nearby police officers immediately blew their whistles to call for help. Zhao Longsheng, the director of the Pudong Fire Brigade, led his entire staff to rescue the victims. Zhang, the director of the Pudong Public Security Bureau, also supervised Cai and Liu, officials, and patrol officers to assist in the rescue. Fortunately, there were many people available, and the collapsed houses were completely cleared within an hour. Eight injured people of all ages were rescued. Dr. Wang Xiongfei from Peidong Hospital arrived on the scene to provide treatment. Because the rescue was relatively quick, no one lost their lives.</p>
<p>Alternative Arrangements for Aftermath: The names, ages, origins, and injuries of the eight rescued people are as follows: (1) Wang Ping, female, 4 years old, from Hubei, lightly injured, discharged after bandaging. (2) Wu Gen, male, 28 years old, from Ningbo, lightly injured, discharged. (3) Zhao Alou, female, 21 years old, from Hubei, seriously injured in the left thigh, abdomen, and corner of the eye, unable to move. (4) Mrs. Chen Tong, 40 years old, from Liyang, injured in the right elbow. (5) Chen Ruiying, female, 8 years old, from Liyang, injured in the face, swollen back of the head. (6) Chen Xiaomao, male, 1 year old, from Liyang, seriously injured in the right face and internal organs, unable to breastfeed, in critical condition. (7) Mrs. Wang Peng, female, 44 years old, from Hubei, unable to move her right leg, multiple skin injuries, serious internal injuries. (8) Wang Xingzi, male, 11 years old, from Hubei, a large laceration on the right thigh, about the size of a palm, also injured in the right shoulder. Director Zhang reported the details of the tragic incident to the General Bureau for review. At the same time, alternative arrangements were made for the injured refugees to provide relief.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Balcony on Avenue Joffre Collapses, Injuring People; One Girl and One Western Woman Dead; Two Other Children Injured, Condition Still Critical <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The balcony in front of the building at No. 749 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession suddenly collapsed at around 3:00 PM on the 10th. It happened that two girls and one boy, three children of Yu Azhang, owner of the Aikeli leather shoe store at No. 723 on the same street, were passing by while out buying food. A Westerner was also injured. They were sent to the hospital for treatment in critical condition. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the two buildings, No. 749 and No. 751, belong to an old local woman, Zhu Gao. They are rented by a local man, Zhang Shaoquan. He lives on the upper floors and rents out parts of the building. He operates Yongtai Cigarette Shop on the ground floor of No. 751. The shop front at No. 749 is sublet to Zhou Ada (43 years old), who runs Fat Tai Fruit and Beef Shop. The building was originally a *shikumen*-style building without a balcony. It was installed by the second landlord, Zhang Shaoquan (46 years old), for temporary storage of goods. After many years, it had rotted from wind and rain and had become shaky. However, Zhang was stingy and did not hire workers to repair it. At 3:05 PM on the 10th, Fu Sheng (16 years old, from Shaoxing), an apprentice at Yongtai Cigarette Shop, went to the balcony at No. 749 to fetch a kerosene can. Due to the movement, the corroded balcony could not bear the weight and suddenly collapsed, causing a great disaster. The apprentice, Lu Fusheng, lost his balance and fell, but was not injured. However, the children, two girls and one boy, and a Westerner who were passing by were affected. After the incident, the French police were notified and immediately sent detectives to the scene. They first sent the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment and took the accountant of Yongtai Cigarette Shop, Zhang Puru (28 years old, from Nanxiang), and the apprentice, Lu Fusheng, as well as Zhou Ada, the owner of Fat Tai Fruit and Beef Shop, to the police station for investigation. Zhang Shaoquan, the owner of Yongtai Cigarette Shop, had fled. Detectives supervised the shop assistants of both stores to remove the fallen balcony wood and debris to clear the way for pedestrians. The six-year-old girl, Yu Sanbao, was the most seriously injured, with head injuries. She died at 5:53 PM that evening. The hospital notified the police to transport the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan autopsy center. The next day, the Second Special Court was notified. The chief prosecutor, Chen Beisan, along with forensic doctor Jiang and secretary Peng, arrived at the center at noon to verify that the deceased had died from head injuries caused by being crushed. He took the case and questioned the defendant Zhang Puru, Lu Fusheng, and witnesses Zhu Gao and Zhou Ada. He then ordered that the body be released to the family for burial after they had signed a statement, pending an investigation by the police department in accordance with the law. The Westerner, a Portuguese woman (name unknown), also died in the hospital at around 10:00 AM the next day due to her injuries. The condition of the other two injured children, Yu Sanbao's sister, Abao, 10 years old, and brother, Yinsong, 8 years old, is still critical. It is heard that the police will transfer the defendants to the Second Special Court today for questioning.</p>

<p>Tie Lisheng, a secretary in several departments, recently died in a horse riding accident. This was reported in a previous newspaper. The Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, Mingbao School, and friends from various quarters held a memorial service at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road, Fenglin Bridge, at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 12th) to express their condolences. Over five to six hundred people attended. Executive Yuan Vice President Kong Xiangxi and his wife, their sons and daughters, and Zheng Hongnian, Wu Jisun, and others attended. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue</p>
<p>A simple colored archway was erected at the entrance of the funeral home auditorium. The archway was surrounded by elegiac couplets, memorial banners, and fresh flower wreaths. The hall was decorated very solemnly. Simple candlesticks were placed on the spirit altar, with Tie's portrait in the middle. Incense smoke wafted, creating a solemn atmosphere. The four walls of the auditorium were also filled with elegiac couplets.</p>
<p>Funeral Procession</p>
<p>1. Playing of funeral music. 2. Singing hymns. 3. Prayers. 4. Reading the Bible. 5. Report on Tie's deeds. 6. Singing hymns. 7. Reading the eulogy. 8. Singing hymns. 9. Family thanks. 10. Blessings. 11. Playing of funeral music. After a classmate of Tie's reported on his deeds, Minister Kong stood up and briefly stated that Lisheng's character could be summarized in the four words "loyal, righteous, and courageous." He recounted Tie's time studying at Mingxian School and his service in various fields. His words and gestures moved everyone present. Finally, he encouraged alumni of Mingxian School in Shanghai to prioritize the welfare of the country and society in their work so that they would not be ashamed to have lived in this world. Next, Li Qingxuan delivered a eulogy, with tears in his voice, moving the entire assembly. In particular, the eulogy personally written by Tie's wife, Wang Qiwen, was the most sincere and touching. It was exceptionally mournful.</p>
<p>Eulogy</p>
<p>On the 12th day of May, the 24th year of the Republic of China, Li Yumei and others from the funeral committee, colleagues from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, classmates from Mingxian School, and friends from various quarters, respectfully open this memorial service for our deceased friend Tie Lisheng and announce it with this text. Alas, Lisheng, did you really die? Did you really meet such a tragic end by falling from a horse? I have shared feelings with you for over ten years, knowing you well. I heard your classmates say that when you studied at Mingxian, your excellent reputation spread, and everyone respected and loved you. After graduating from the Northwest Army Cadre School, you joined the military and were valued by Zhang Gongzi, being promoted as an outstanding rising military talent. Kong Gong recruited you as an assistant, managing affairs in an orderly manner. I thought that you not only had the talent to manage the army but also had ample ability to govern. I hoped that your future would be unlimited, but who knew that you would encounter this sudden change? I and other colleagues often only met once every few days, but I would talk and laugh with you morning and evening when working with Kong Gong. On the day of the accident, I was having dinner with you, but who knew that in half a day, we would be separated by life and death? Your straightforward and talented nature, your steadfast and simple demeanor, seemed to indicate that you could achieve great things and live a long life. But who knew that you would suddenly die in your prime? I know that the length of life is predetermined, but after ten years of sharing similar interests, someone with whom I have laughed and talked with suddenly passes away. How can I not feel pain in my heart? And you left behind your widowed wife and no hope for an orphan. Does this not make people feel even more disappointed and sigh without end? Regarding the matters after your death, Kong Gong paid close attention, entrusting me and your old friends to handle them in a proper and appropriate manner, hoping to comfort you in the afterlife. But the sorrow in my heart cannot be fully expressed. I hope you will appreciate this humble sentiment.</p>
<p>Wife's Eulogy</p>
<p>On the 12th day of May, the 24th year of the Republic of China, your wife, Wang Qiwen, cries and tells your spirit, my husband Lisheng: Alas, Lisheng, why did you leave me behind? The initial news brought hope that we would meet the next morning, but who would have thought that it would become a stream that would never return? Heartbreaking and soul-shattering, there is nothing comparable. Crying and wailing, I call out without knowing when to stop. I will no longer be with people in this world. Lying still in death, sleeping soundly, I want to follow you, but my heart and soul cannot reach you. The sky is dark, and I almost cannot distinguish the truth from falsehood in the world. Sometimes I believe it, sometimes I doubt it. Is it a dream? Have you really left me? I used to never let you leave my side, sharing every moment, every meal. But from now on, I will never have you again. How heartbreaking, how tragic! The so-called heaven is unpredictable, and the gods are incomprehensible. Even gods and humans cannot understand. Recalling the time from our marriage to today, it has only been six years, and half of that time was spent apart. How pitiful and sad! Could there be anything longer and more unbearable than this? Alas, I will no longer have you. The world will no longer see you. I used to not believe in the existence of gods, but today I must consult a sorcerer. Although, you have gone first and are not alone. My spirit will follow you. The reason why my body remains is that you were loyal and filial. I have an elderly grandmother of seventy and an old father of sixty. Can I not be filial? But the pain in my heart will never be erased. You have been gone for nine days. Do you know? Have you seen the sorrow and mourning of your superiors and friends, their busy and troubled minds? They dress you in brocade clothes, place you in a coffin, and bury you in a good place. Soon, I will see you again, leaving this evil world, escaping the vast sea of suffering. Blessed, blessed, why don't you take me with you quickly? Two months ago, you said that if I died, you would erect a monument to commemorate me. Unexpectedly, today I am here to cry for you, prepare you, and bury you. I can only disfigure my face, wear humble clothes, and long for a piece of land in Shanghai. How sad, how sad! I can no longer speak. If your spirit knows, please understand.</p>
<p>Summary of Elegiac Couplets</p>
<p>There were many elegiac couplets displayed at yesterday's meeting, too many to record individually. Here are some of the most notable ones: Kong Xiangxi: "We followed each other in our youth, originally hoping to spread our wings and fly, working together to serve the country. Our ambitions were not fulfilled. Who would have thought that you would die while riding a horse, causing your peers to lose a talent?" Zhang Zhijiang: "We were comrades-in-arms for a long time, recalling the revitalization of national arts. You helped me with numerous plans. Unexpected events arise. Those who are good riders often fall. I will no longer see you wielding your whip." Zheng Hongnian: "I remember working with you in the Ministry of Works. Your free spirit and heroic posture were something I always appreciated. The news of your fall from a horse was shocking. The sound of the carriage and your words still echo in my ears." Li Qingxuan: "Looking back on your life, you were especially heroic among our few friends. Recently, we traveled to Shanghai together, spending time together day and night. Who would have expected such grief to come so suddenly? The news of your fall from a horse arrived. On that day, the 5/3 National Humiliation Day, heaven was full of sorrow. How could I bear to lose another good friend? The sounds of music have disappeared. From now on, I can only increase my commemoration, learning from Hong Luyu's cries." Zou Lin: "Sighing that you fell halfway, I now know that the path of the world lacks strength and robustness." Li Tang: "Your extraordinary spirit suppressed Chen Lou. We both promoted the bearded Shen Can. You deserved to be chosen for your talent. A sad wind rises from the Huangpu River. Who would have thought that your travels south and north would end in a loss of control, causing the death of a hero?" Mingxian School Alumni Association: "Scratching our heads, we ask heaven, why do good people not live long? Grieving in the sunlight, our great ambitions have never been easily realized." Tie's wife: "After six years of marriage, you left behind a widowed swan and a solitary gull. I will live a peaceful life. How could your heart bear it? We will follow you to the nine heavens, only to support our parents and guard our ambitions. I will temporarily remain in this world. You know my intentions." Chen Xing: "I often sighed with you, allowing you to test your skills with the reins. Why did you die so quickly? I feel even more saddened by the loss of talent." Fan Guang and Fan Songfu: "You stirred the reins, determined to clarify the situation. Your swift feet once pierced Hebei. You wielded your whip bravely. A literary star fell in Jiangnan overnight." Zeng Kezhuan: "With great ambition, you awaited a swift steed, hoping to soar in the wind and clouds. It is painful that you fell and died in your prime. It is difficult to make a living with dew and lightning." Chen Duan: "Your talent surpassed others. I have long been ashamed of my own literary skills. Death is predetermined. I only lament that you fell from your horse and rode a whale." Yang Hu: "With the external threat of killing the enemy, it is a pity that we have lost a pillar of talent."</p>

<h3 id="e127">Fellow Townsmen from Lishui Protest the Death of Zhou Jiuyuan; What is Zhang Binnan's Responsibility? <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lishui Fellow Townsmen Association in South Shanghai reported that member Zhou Jiufu claimed that his brother, Zhou Jiuyuan, had been working at the North Piao Coal Mine Wharf in South Huangpu. On the 6th, he boarded a coal truck driven by Zhang Binnan, a driver for the North China Coal Mine Company, to go to the North City. While driving past No. 341 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, he lost his balance due to the swaying of the vehicle, fell, and injured his head. He immediately lost consciousness. At the time, the other workers on the truck, Li Xinxiang and Zhang Fuge, ordered Zhang Binnan to stop the vehicle to rescue him, but Zhang ignored them and continued to drive quickly. As a result, Jiuyuan did not receive medical treatment in time and died from his injuries. The body was transported by the car to the Tongren Fu Yuan autopsy center. Later, the French police summoned and questioned those involved. Zhang Binnan admitted in court that Jiuyuan died from falling off his swaying vehicle and volunteered to compensate for the costs of clothing and coffin. He then informed Jiufu to sign a statement to claim the body. However, after Zhang Binnan arrived in court, he shirks his responsibility and denied his previous statement. The deceased has a seventy-year-old mother and a wife and children. Their future livelihoods are in dire straits. Therefore, assistance is requested. Hearing this, all the fellow townsmen in the association felt indignant. They convened an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to send personnel to investigate. They also sent a letter to the director of the French Police Station in Chu Jia Wan, French Concession, and letters to various organizations requesting assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Dispute Arises Over Pig Transportation in Wusong; Almost Leads to a Strike <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Most of the fresh pork needed daily in Shanghai is supplied by pig farms in Wusong. Therefore, thousands of pigs are transported from Wusong to Shanghai every day. The Songhu United Transportation Company and other companies are contracted to handle the loading and transportation. Recently, the company's trucks were suddenly fined and suspended from operation for one day by the Wusong Office of the Municipal Health Bureau on some pretext. The company was very dissatisfied with the penalty because the Health Bureau has no direct authority to punish vehicle violations. Therefore, it filed an appeal, requesting an investigation. This was heard by Yu Dongmo, the director of the Wusong Office of the Health Bureau, who yesterday coerced various pig farms to provide written proof that the aforementioned situation had not occurred. The pig farms refused to comply. The director then refused to issue inspection slips, preventing the pigs from being transported, as a threat. As a result, pig trucks completely accumulated on the roads outside the port, causing traffic congestion. Hearing this, the pig farms were greatly angered and collectively went on strike. Fu Zhenbei, the director of the Wusong Police Station, learned of the situation and, fearing that the incident would escalate, immediately went to persuade them. The pig farms then convened an emergency meeting and decided to appoint several representatives to go to the municipal government on the 13th (today) to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>

<p>Li Jinfang, the magistrate of Jingjiang County, because *Jingjiang Daily* published an article on May 1 entitled "Injection Novel," considered it to be referring to his ambiguous relationship with a certain woman. In a fit of rage, he arrested Liu Jianfan, the editor of the newspaper, and armed the order for the newspaper to cease publication.

The reporter eagerly sought to experience it firsthand. Last night, upon receiving an invitation and reserved seating from a friend, I made my way there before 8:00 PM. At that time, the stage was presenting Sun Wukong's birth. The entire theater was filled with people, a sea of faces and fragrant clothing. The stage machinery and scenery were exquisitely chosen, and the casting was excellent. The entire play was full of highlights, especially Zhang Yipeng's performance in the Dragon Palace, where he wielded the whip with skill and ease, truly a unique talent. According to the playwright, the play, although based on the novel "Journey to the West," meticulously removed the dross and simplified the complexities. The scene where Sun Wukong avenges the snow and rescues the monkey tribe embodies the spirit of the nation, with profound implications. Other characters, such as Wu Zhongye's loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and kindness, the Little Dragon Girl's gratitude for kindness, and the King Yama's impartiality in enforcing the law, are all essential for criticizing society and promoting morality.</p>

<p>The "Legend of the White Snake" is a popular folk tale, and stage performances have become commonplace, often done carelessly and unremarkably. The Common Stage is re-arranging the play, sparing no expense, creating brand new, specially-made scenery, racking their brains to invent several scientific mechanisms, and hiring actors who fit the roles to give full performances. The magnificent scenery includes the birth of the White Snake, with lights that do not go out, transforming into human form on the spot. Also, the White and Green Snakes, each three or four zhang long, fight with magic in a room, and people are suspended in mid-air without the use of lead wires or ropes, hanging high in the air. Other scenes, such as the real scenery of West Lake, the Immortal Dao Gate, and the Kunlun Wonderland, change four times in quick succession, unexpected and surprising. It is currently being rushed day and night and will be ready for opening soon, especially suitable for responding to the capital during the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>

<h3 id="e138">German Romanticism <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>Romanticism varies in its emergence due to the differing political, economic, and literary conditions of individual countries. There are also clear or subtle differences in its progressive nature. On the other hand, it stems from the differences in the societies to which various writers belong. In essence, it manifests in two styles: progressive (consistent with the laws of historical development) and degenerate (contrary to the laws of historical development).</p>
<p>Degenerate aristocratic Romanticism is characterized by an avoidance of reality and an immersion in irrational fantasies. This includes a retrospective tendency—such as drawing images and themes exclusively from the declining world of the feudal aristocracy, avoiding the modernity of England and tending toward Byron (Byron), who still retained natural, economic organizations, and Scott (Scott), whose themes were based on medieval life; and a flight to the countryside—taking a negative attitude toward the city, viewing it as a dirty source of all evil, and seeing the morally healthiest people in independent farmers, as exemplified by Wordsworth (Wordsworth). Similarly, in Germany during the two or three decades before and after the eighteenth century, Romanticist literature also exhibited two distinct postures. Although during this period, the color of such retrospective fantasy was intensely dyed onto both different Romanticist poems because, on the one hand, the aristocracy was forming and the serf system was collapsing, and on the other hand, the emerging citizens had not yet grasped the power to guide politics and economy, we can still see the differences even in this aspect: The retrospective fantasy nature of degenerate Romanticism is mainly because this group has already completed its historical mission and task, has lost the ability to dominate the existing society, and this realization in rapid transition makes it feel a sense of decline, so it dares not face reality, avoids it, and indulges in the memories of its young and prosperous era, using this memory to fill its own life, comfort itself, and at the same time decorate reality with it, idealize and beautify it. Examples include Friedrich Fouque and Archim Von Arnim as representatives of this art.</p>
<p>As one of the forward-looking Romanticists of this period, Amadeus Hoffmann, although sometimes expressing a retrospective fantasy nature in his works, his fantasy grew out of the reality of the daily life he described. What he looked back on was not the pastoral feudal era of knights, but the cities of Germany at the end of the Middle Ages (such as his description of the life of craftsmen in German cities at the end of the Middle Ages and their relationships with each other in "Barrel Master Martin and His Apprentices"). This fantasy is healthy. It is a longing for a broader world, feeling the narrowness of early bourgeois society. It is "the literature that describes a more meaningful future life in the form of an ideal poetic country." His fantasy can be said to have come from a fervent hope and prayer for the future of the new society. Such fantasy is realistic, is the image of necessity contained in reality itself, and therefore has gained the highest evaluation.</p>
<p>In Germany during the 1840s, due to changes in the socio-economic forms, the collapse of small industry, and the rise of the mechanical age and the commercialization of all life, brilliant new ideas suddenly emerged in the intellectual world.</p>
<p>At this time, Germany began to liberate itself from semi-aristocratic police supervision, from Romantic dreams, from pastoral sleep, and from the atmosphere of theological metaphysics. Therefore, the face of Romanticist literature became more diverse and complex. The new style of lyric poetry—political lyric poetry—was the product of this period. The greatest completer of political lyric poetry was Heine (Heine). The entire life of the poet Heine, a radical democrat, straddled the collapse of feudal society and the establishment of capitalist society. His life breathed in a changing society. From this came his conviction of future victory, and also his conviction of the necessity of religion; a fierce attacker of monks and emperors, and on the other hand, a lyric poet who praised love, lilies, and nightingales: a prophet with abundant eyes, and also a petty vulgar person. This instability of the intellectual in the transitional period was expressed in Heine's creation in a very clear way.</p>
<p>What gave Heine's current affairs and political lyric poetry a distinctive feature was Heine's unique method in creation, a special kind of Romanticism. He did not express the reality as an object in its original form, but rather transformed reality into an object of fantasy and constructed a world of fantasy. Brandes (Brandes) called this method a means of the Romantic transformation of reality. Therefore, the "interweaving of reality and shadow" in most of Heine's poems (such as "Germany: A Winter's Tale"), just as he himself called his poems "political Romanticism," is unique to Heine's poetry.</p>
<p>Heine wove into his lyric poetry a warm emotion and a calm wit, and gave Prussian princes, monks, and especially "papists" scolding and ridicule. His thorn-like satire and the sharp sound of ridicule gave these figures a powerful blow.</p>
<p>Although Heine never obtained a fixed and completely unified worldview, which caused him to show considerable confusion in his understanding of reality; however, this suffering was the suffering of all his people in that era, the suffering of the era.</p>
<p>In addition, Immermann, who was the same type as Heine, can only be briefly mentioned here.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Writer's Conscience <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Mu</p>
<p>The concept of "conscience" is usually abstracted and mystified; there is probably no absolute, general conscience in fact. Usually, people say "discovery of conscience," which, if explored using Freud's method of "psychoanalysis," seems to correspond to the human "unconscious." However, this explanation ultimately delves into the "dead end," because even the human "unconscious" has the cornerstone rooted in human social circumstances rather than Freud's libido. Different social circumstances of course cannot produce a general, universal "conscience."</p>
<p>This only means that human "conscience" is different, not that humans have no conscience at all. No, people with a "conscience" exist at all times and in all places.</p>
<p>When we look at Andre Gide's life, it is truly a great tragedy of conscience. At first, like the blind girl Gertrude in "Pastoral Symphony," he was full of yearning for the truth: "Are the birds on the earth as beautiful as they say? Why don't people tell me this at all?" The distress and cruelty that reality gave him became the fuel for his quest for truth. People say that his life changed due to the influence of Bergson's philosophy; however, in fact, it was the various conditions of reality that caused the touch of a writer with a "conscience." The words spoken by the blind girl Gertrude when her eyes were opened again seem to be Gide unburdening himself for the present: "My eyes have been opened, to a world more beautiful than I imagined. Yes, I really didn't think the sun was so bright, the air was so brilliant, the sky was so vast!"</p>
<p>In the furnace of reality, the waste of the writer's old consciousness will sometimes be burned off. At this time, his "conscience" is refined more and more precisely and firmly. It constantly interacts and fluctuates with the torrent of reality.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Sending A-Bao Out of the Golden Age <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Zikai</p>
<p>A-Bao, you and I have been together in this world for fourteen years now. In these more than five thousand days, we have been together almost every day, with rarely a day of separation. I watched you come into the world with a cry, and learn to speak with your first words. I watched you change from breastfeeding to eating, from crawling to learning to walk. Your demeanor gradually changed, little by little, without any trace, so that I was completely unaware and thought that you were always a child of my family, always a kind of embellishment in our family, and always a consoler of the lives of me and your mother. However, in recent years, the changes in your attitude and behavior have gradually proved that this is not the case. You have grown into a young girl without our realizing it, and are about to become an adult. The ancients said, "The age of one's parents must be known; one is happy, and the other is fearful." Now I have gone against the words of the ancients, and when I send you out of the golden age, I also feel both sad and happy.</p>
<p>What is happy is that the changes in your attitude and behavior in recent years are all signs that you are about to change from a child to an adult. My hard work and my mother's labor seem to have been successful, and I am secretly gratified. What is sad is that your golden age is about to end, reality is gradually being exposed, you will stop your beautiful dreams and start the struggle of life. At the same time, in us, it is as if we have lost a child who has been snuggling by our side since childhood, and gained a new friend instead. "There is no joy greater than new acquaintances": But the innocent and carefree A-Bin of the past will never be seen again?</p>
<p>I remember one day last spring, I took your hand and walked on the road. The falling flowers and the wind blew a flurry of willow catkins onto your hair, face, and lips, making you look like you were covered in snow and had a white beard. I smiled, held your shoulder, and wiped it off for you with a handkerchief. You also smiled, raised your head and leaned against me. This was originally a very ordinary thing for us: Before, I used to wash your face for you every day after you ate. However, the people on the road were staring at us, even laughing at us. The meaning seemed to be saying: "Such a big girl," hugging her father on the road to wipe her face! I suddenly saw that your body seemed to be taller, fully developed, and had completely changed from a neutral child to a full-fledged woman. I suddenly felt that a very high, very firm, and very thick invisible wall seemed to have been built between you and me. You grew up in my arms, and grew up in my care: But from now on, you and I will forever live in two different worlds. In an instant, I felt a deep sadness in my heart. I blamed you for not wanting to grow up forever, I blamed myself for wanting to be a child and for wanting to grow up, and I blamed mankind for having a distinction between men and women. However, after blaming, I immediately turned grief into laughter. Our A-Bin is about to grow into a big girl, isn't that a happy thing?</p>
<p>I remember one day when I came back from Shanghai. Your brothers and sisters, as usual, crowded around me, waiting for me to take out the "goodies" from my suitcase to share. I gladly took out a bunch of chocolates and gave each of you a pack. Your younger siblings, upon receiving these colorful gold and silver chocolates, were as happy as usual, making a big fuss and joyfully taking them to enjoy. You accepted the gift and also expressed your joy, following your younger siblings. However, a few days later, I happened to look down from the upstairs window and saw you by the flower stand, holding a newly opened pack of chocolates and dividing them among your two younger siblings. They were arguing over who got more and who got less, and you were busy dividing them equally for them. On a piece of chocolate with a missing corner, you added a piece of colorful gold and silver wrapping paper and gave it to your younger sister, so that it was fair on all three sides. They were happy to eat the candy, and you were happy to watch them eat. This surprised me. Eating chocolate has always been a great pleasure for the children in my family. Because in the countryside, there are only candies wrapped in reed leaves and cakes wrapped in straw paper, and there are no such colorful gold and silver candies; there are only extremely sweet candied dates and extremely sweet preserved green fruits, and there are no such candies with exotic aromas and flavors. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e142">Leisure <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>Farmers' most common leisure place is the teahouse.</p>
<p>The teahouses in the countryside are very simple, so there is no need to spend much money. Just four or five copper coins will allow you to sit there for half a day. And that place is really suitable for sharing feelings and finding out news.</p>
<p>There are more than a hundred families in our village, but only three or four small shops. There is no teahouse. To share feelings or find out news, you have to walk more than three miles, which is not surprising for farm laborers. They have no idea that there are cars, trams, and rickshaws in the world.</p>
<p>When I was young, I often went to those places to sit and listen to the news. I knew most of the people who came and went to the teahouse. The news singer was called Jin Chang, and he was blind. Whatever new things happened in the various villages, as long as it was ten days later, you could hear the details from beginning to end in Jin Chang's mouth, with songs, dialogues, and jokes.</p>
<p>This blind man often gave people laughter, sighs, and tears.</p>
<p>I have been away from my hometown for ten years. And in these ten years, I have also had laughter, sighs, and tears. However, there are mostly sighs than laughter. Whenever I was sad and indignant, there was not a single pleasant joke to make me happy. Therefore, I often think of Jin Chang, the blind man. He knew how to insert jokes into tragedies to prevent everyone from being depressed; but I am always depressed, and my tragedies have never had any laughter inserted.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because I wanted to find laughter! This time, when I returned home, I brought with me a feeling of visiting old friends and returned to that teahouse.</p>
<p>The entrance was still so dim and dilapidated, not eye-catching at all: The white sign with red characters, after being beaten by wind and eroded by rain, had already lost the "spring" character from "De Chun Teahouse." Coming into the door, there was a middle-aged woman sitting on the counter, holding a child to breastfeed. In the dark house, there were seven or eight square tables, with ten or so people sitting, either chatting, dozing, or holding teapots in a daze. But I didn't recognize any of them.</p>
<p>I sat down at a table on the left, and a teenager poured me a pot of green tea. The eyes of the whole room were directed at me. I called to the boy who was about to turn away and asked:</p>
<p>"What time does the blind man Jin Chang come?"</p>
<p>"What blind man Jin Chang?"</p>
<p>"The one who sings the news."</p>
<p>"There's no one here who sings the news."</p>
<p>I felt it was pointless and didn't ask any further. But the one who was dozing across from me raised his head and looked at me.</p>
<p>"You look familiar!"</p>
<p>"Really? Old man, what's your name?"</p>
<p>"I'm Sanbao, the tofu seller. I haven't had a surname since I was a child."</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered that that person was exactly Sanbao, who shouted and sold tofu along the village every morning. He was great at talking, and we all called him San Huotou, who knew…</p>
<p>"Your husband is…"</p>
<p>"I'm the XX from the Erfang of Gutang Village."</p>
<p>"Ah! I recognize you. No wonder, you just asked about the blind man Jin Chang. You've been used to listening to him sing the news since you were a child."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's because I've been used to listening to him since I was a child. I don't know why he doesn't come now?"</p>
<p>"He died five or six years ago."</p>
<p>I wanted to ask more, but in the end I didn't open my mouth.</p>
<p>"It's not as lively as it used to be now. There are a lot of people, but business is slow." He said, turning his head, "We still can't make two thousand a day, can we, Sister Asheng!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Da Mao Ye said last night that if we continue like this, we'll have to close up." The woman upstairs replied.</p>
<p>"Hongtai Company has already closed its doors today." The two people who were chatting suddenly raised their voices, but then lowered them again and sighed.</p>
<p>Immediately, like a contagious disease, the whole room sighed.</p>
<p>"We can't harvest even half a grain of rice from the fields, who has spare money to sell things?" Sanbao said, shaking his head, and then turned to me: "We used to hate being busy with work and wanted to steal a little leisure and come here for a cup of tea; now we're idle all day long, where do we spend it? We drink tea until our tongues are thick."</p>
<p>"Eighty coins, can I get it on credit?" A tea customer ran out of the teahouse.</p>
<p>"Pay half, Uncle Wu!, we…" The woman upstairs said.</p>
<p>"I didn't bring any money today." That person ran away.</p>
<p>"When will you bring money!" the woman grumbled.</p>
<p>Sanbao was still shaking his head.</p>
<p>The interesting jokes were all taken away by Jin Chang. What's left here is also a tragedy without laughter inserted.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Rain (Two) <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— By What</p>
<p>He paced back and forth, his mind fixed on the village at the foot of the ridge, for Juanzi lived in that village.</p>
<p>It was a cluster of white houses, all old and sturdy, intertwined like fortresses. Juanzi's house, where she lived with her grandmother, was near the ridge corner, appearing particularly gray and gloomy.</p>
<p>The pavilion was dark and dilapidated, like a broken ferry. Not only were both front and back sides open, exposing it to fierce wind and rain, but the ground was also covered with filthy puddles. When one was tired of standing, even finding a relatively dry spot to squat was impossible.</p>
<p>Tianli waited for them. He wondered how Juanzi, whom he hadn't seen in so long, had grown. He imagined she must be much more beautiful now. The thought of her eyes and lips made his whole body seethe with an uncontrollable, fervent passion. From the pavilion, he could see the gate of Juanzi's house. He remembered how, in their innocent youth, before the old woman had come to dislike Tianli, they had jumped on those stone steps by the entrance countless times. In a cemetery behind the village was the grave of her deceased mother. He couldn't count how many firecrackers they had set off there and how much incense they had burned during the spring and autumn festivals. And, even more unforgettable for him, was the stone bridge on the left side of the village. The memory of them lying together on the stone railing, teasing the washing women, was so sweet it felt as if it were happening right now!</p>
<p>Time passed slowly, but his heart was beating so fast. He felt restless. Sometimes he would glance at the "cartoons" on the pavilion walls and the small characters on the plaques, but most of the time he stared blankly at Juanzi's house. The scenery was beautiful, and the wind and rain were full of poetic charm, but none of it could touch Tianli's heart. In his mind, there was only Juanzi. He stared intently, listening as if he could faintly hear Juanzi's laughter.</p>
<p>The surroundings were silent, without a single movement. There were a few pine trees on the hillside, but he couldn't hear any sound, only see them swaying in the wind. All he could see was gray and white clouds and mist. Occasionally, a few people hurried past, but as the hurried sounds faded away, the "empty valley" seemed even emptier and more desolate.</p>
<p>The rain fell sadly and incessantly.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Absurd Statement Issued by Siamese Ministry of Education: Overseas Chinese in Siam Refute with Reason; Interference in Overseas Chinese Education Violates International Norms; Closure of Chinese Schools under Pretext Is Especially Arrogant <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Since the Siamese Minister of Education, Mr. Paksan Sarapahuwa, issued his absurd statement about restricting Chinese schools, overseas Chinese in Siam and people from all walks of life in our country have been extremely indignant. The overseas Chinese education community in Siam recently refuted it point by point with reasons to awaken the Siamese authorities. Our reporter from the Industrial and Commercial News Agency obtained the original text of the rebuttal and transcribed it below:</p>
<p>Forcing Siamese Schools Violates International Law</p>
<p>(1) Although independent countries have autonomy over their own education, international practice holds that foreign nationals enjoy the right to education within the confines of the laws of their place of residence. These nationals may establish schools in their place of residence to teach their children their native language, script, and civic knowledge. For example, China has established overseas Chinese primary schools in Europe, America, Japan, and even the islands of Southeast Asia, where instruction is given in Chinese language and script. Even the curriculum is designed to meet the needs of the Chinese national situation and has been implemented for many years. It has never been heard of that any government in the place of residence has forced Chinese children to attend schools established by that country under the enforcement of compulsory education. Even in China, although the recovery of educational rights has been underway in recent years, it only applies to joint foreign and Chinese education schools and schools attended by overseas Chinese children. It is not appropriate to interfere with schools established by foreigners for their own nationals. The scope of sovereignty is, in fact, to despise international norms. (2) The Siamese Civil School Ordinance of 2461 B.E. and the Compulsory Education Ordinance of 2464 B.E. only apply to schools established for the people of Siam. There are no explicit provisions for overseas Chinese, which is also inconsistent with international practice.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Party Doctrine: How Can it Be Considered Lenient?</p>
<p>(3) Since Chinese schools and Siamese schools are different, the Siamese government should not treat them the same way or impose measures on them. Therefore, the previous methods permitted by your office, with frequent interference, are still far from the original purpose of establishing Chinese schools. How can this be considered giving special privileges to Chinese schools? (4) Based on the above, it is very clear that the Siamese government should not force Chinese schools to be uniformly restricted by these regulations. Now, even the compulsory classes established by Chinese schools are being canceled uniformly. How can one even speak of leniency in the curriculum? (5) Most of the Chinese schools are primary schools, with only two or three junior high schools. Their curriculum follows the standards set by the Chinese Ministry of Education, with only civic knowledge and no so-called political books. To adapt to the environment, Chinese schools also teach the Siamese language, literature, history, and geography. These arrangements should not hinder Siamese laws or security. Now, the Siamese government sometimes finds one or two books on the Three Principles of the People in schools and uses this as a pretext to close schools for teaching political doctrines. Is this reasonable?</p>
<p>Disparate Treatment of Chinese and Siamese People</p>
<p>(6) On the Chinese school side, the Progressive Association understands the Siamese government's intentions and勉力 proceeds, and the Siamese government prepares two kinds of democratic education regulations and hires Siamese people as principals, following the key points of teaching Siamese. The difficulties and obstacles are already difficult to describe. But now, schools are being closed on the grounds of violating laws and regulations, and the right to education that Chinese schools should have is being completely canceled. This is especially arrogant. (7) As mentioned above, the purpose of establishing Chinese schools is only to teach the motherland's language, script, life skills, and civic knowledge. There is no need to suspect the so-called teaching of political doctrines. The right to attend Chinese schools is also only for schools run by Siamese people that also teach Chinese as a subject, and also to assist Chinese people, whether newly arrived or long-term residents in Siam, to enjoy the same treatment as Siamese people, which is not entirely true. The differences are as follows: (A) Chinese people are subject to immigration laws and must pay residence taxes, while Siamese people do not. (B) Chinese people must pay for passports when leaving the country and are required to return to Siam within a limited period, while Siamese people do not. (C) In the Siamese election law, Siamese people have the right to vote, while Chinese people do not. (D) The recently promulgated fisheries regulations limit fishermen to obtaining licenses, with Siamese people accounting for 75% and Chinese people only 25%. Other unequal treatment in industrial and commercial operations is too numerous to mention. If we apply the principle that there should be rights where there are obligations, then nothing is more unequal than this.</p>
<p>Insulting Overseas Chinese Is Evident</p>
<p>(8) The Siamese Ministry of Education denies the right to establish Chinese schools and violates the purpose of overseas Chinese educating their children. It wants to force overseas Chinese to fulfill obligations they should not have to fulfill, just like fishermen use cormorants to catch fish and put a ring around their necks. In other words, it treats overseas Chinese as slaves. Its contempt for our country and insult to our compatriots is evident. Sophistry cannot cover the eyes and ears of the world.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Recent News from Zhejiang Provincial Library: Compiling and Printing General Catalog of Books... Open Day and Night Throughout the Year... Promoting Correspondence Lending... Holding Reading Campaigns <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Since Zhejiang Provincial Library opened the University Road branch in September of the 21st year and established the original location as a branch, library affairs have been developing daily. Educational groups from Shanghai and other places who travel to Hangzhou to visit often go to see its facilities. The situation is gradually attracting attention from people at home and abroad. Recent news is as follows: (1) Promoting Reading and Borrowing: Since September of last year, the library has implemented a year-round day and night opening system, canceling the previous Monday holiday. Except for New Year's and commemorative holidays, the library is open every day from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM, with no interruption during meal times. All sectors feel it is convenient. This year, the library is further promoting group borrowing services. By April, reading and borrowing had reached 27,750 people, an average of 975 people per day. The average number of books borrowed daily was 226. Recently, the library, in view of the small scale of libraries in various counties of the province, will formulate a correspondence lending method within the province, which will be implemented from May 1st. (2) Compiling and Printing a General Catalog of Books: The library's previous compilation and publication of the catalog was ten years ago, with incomplete content, no classification code, and unsuitable for current use. Therefore, since last year, the library has been compiling a book-style catalog that combines the old and new books that have been sorted out. The catalog contains about 100,000 books, listing the book name, author, and edition, using a self-ordered thousand-classification table. It is bound in two volumes using a five-six binding method. The first volume was published at the end of April. This is a necessity for the above two lending methods. In addition to exchanging with major libraries, the library sells pre-orders (the list price is six yuan, and the pre-order price is three yuan and six jiao). In addition, the catalog of rare books has also been compiled and is awaiting printing, and the catalog of Western books is still being compiled. (3) Holding Reading Campaigns: The library, in view of the failure to popularize the reading atmosphere, has long had the intention of holding reading campaigns. This time, the Zhejiang branch of the China Cultural Construction Association held a reading campaign at the end of April, and the library actively participated.</p>

<h3 id="e157">China-Portugal Football Cup Final: China Wins Again Against the Portuguese Team; 5-2 The Cup Has Been Permanently Preserved by China; Xu Jingcheng Was the Most Outstanding Player in Yesterday's Game <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>After winning the standard with one win and one draw in the China-Portugal Football Cup, China has shown its prominence and high morale. Yesterday, they met for the last time and gave Portugal a very fierce display of power. As a result, China won again by five to one. China's Xu Jingcheng is young and strong, good at running and grabbing. He is the real hero of China's victory. The situation of yesterday's game is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Portugal Takes the Lead</p>
<p>At the start of the game, the Portuguese team's forwards made a probing attack, which was rejected and retreated. China counterattacked with both sound and appearance. However, the enemy's defense was strict, and there was no opportunity to take advantage of it. After five minutes, China's offensive gradually weakened, and the Portuguese team attacked decisively. Colasa dribbled past people, and Gu Shangdong could not stop him. Zhang Rongcai jumped up to grab the ball and grabbed an empty space, so Luo Zican attacked and scored.</p>
<p>China Takes the Lead in the First Half</p>
<p>After losing a goal, China used its life and launched a major counterattack. Xu Juecheng ran around the field, which was quite laborious. When Li Yichen brought the ball forward, the enemy's defense committed a handball foul outside the penalty area line. Xu Jingcheng kicked hard, and it happened to hit C Huang Shanfu's hand, and a penalty was awarded. Sun Jinshun kicked it in. Five minutes later, Li Yichen cleverly scored a goal with the assistance of Liang Shutang. China's football luck turned for the better from then on. Zhong Jia contacted and advanced and passed the ball to the center from afar. Qian Jingyong saw the opportunity and rushed up, dodged the entanglement of Remidi, and was actually rushed in. In the first half, China took the lead with three to one.</p>
<p>Fafan Shoots Cleverly in the Gap</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, China's offensive was still very strong. Li Yichen had a chance in front of the goal but failed to kick it in. After the enemy escaped danger, they suddenly came to the fore. Colasa came from the middle, and Li Mi stopped him. The ball fell to the right, and Fafan waited early in the gap. Taking advantage of the situation, he lifted his foot and swept low, and goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai was caught off guard and lost the goal.</p>
<p>Youliang and Yongsheng Both Score</p>
<p>After the Portuguese team scored two to two, they frequently thought of winning by surprise. Colasa and Fafan repeatedly led troops deep into the area, pressing aggressively. Fortunately, China's defense was too tight to avoid difficulty. At the bottom, Xu Jingcheng sent out a ball, Yichen's feet shuttled, and Zhong Yongsheng rushed into China from the right corner, so China won by five to.</p>

<p>Jinan Dispatch: Our province's selection of athletes to participate in the National Games began on the 8th of this month with the opening of the preliminary selection meeting. The selection of male and female all-around track and field athletes was completed on the 9th, and the list has already been published in previous reports. The selection of national martial arts athletes was completed on the 10th. For the selection of various ball games, the preliminary selection meeting decided to prioritize quality over quantity this year. There will be no selection for volleyball, only for men's football and basketball, and women's basketball and softball teams, totaling four teams. The preliminary rounds began on the morning of the 9th, the semi-finals on the 10th, and today (the 11th) is the fourth day, with all finals being held. The selection method follows the precedent of the previous games, not focusing on team competitions, but emphasizing individual skills. Therefore, the selection process is extremely difficult, choosing only a dozen or so people from hundreds, resulting in a very well-rounded talent pool, capable of competing for national honors. The competition division of the selection committee held a meeting at the provincial stadium today. After reviewing the track and field all-around and various ball team athletes, a preliminary agreement was reached. After the swimming selection is held tomorrow, a comprehensive report will be submitted to the organizing committee for approval, and they will then be considered the official representative team.

<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education School in Jiangwan built a new school building four years ago and strived for perfect equipment. In order to enrich the students' skills in Shanghai, it later spent a lot of money to build a swimming pool for students and members of the public to learn swimming. Details have been published in previous newspapers. Now the pool was completed and opened last month. The design of the pool is perfect, and it was designed and drawn by Jianming Ye, the most prestigious architect in Shanghai. He has been doing his best for this project. All matters use the latest paving, which is firm, beautiful, and inside the construction industry. It is especially strong and can be guaranteed to be non-slip. The pool is 25 meters long and 10 meters wide. The dressing rooms, sanitary facilities, shower rooms, clothes racks and foot bath pools etc. were built by Guanghua Construction Company. The water and electricity project was contracted by Guangming Company. The pool is surrounded by electric breaks, which can be used for swimming at night.

<h3 id="e171">Silver Problem <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Mingshan</p>
<p>The United States' silver policy, with the current value of the Treasury's silver holdings at $8.6 billion, while the silver reserves are only $915 million, requires the continued purchase of $1.95 billion in silver to meet the gold-to-silver ratio of 3:1. Such a large amount of silver exceeds the current total global supply. Consequently, silver outflow from our country is no accident. As of now, China's existing silver reserves amount to 1.5 billion yuan, significantly impacting our national economy. In light of this, the government, unable to declare a ban on silver exports, ordered the collection of silver export duties and equalization taxes by the Ministry of Finance on October 15th of last year. On the 19th of the same month, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee was established. However, driven by profit, many people resort to smuggling and tax evasion. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance ordered all provinces and cities to combat smuggling in order to prevent this. Moreover, the re-export duty on silver was waived to encourage silver repatriation. The government's palliative policies have achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has repeatedly stated that the United States will continue to purchase silver until the price reaches $1.29 or the Treasury's silver reserves reach the gold-to-silver ratio of 3:1. Currently, the U.S. Treasury's fixed purchase price for silver is still 77 and 57/100 cents per ounce. The U.S.'s silver policy is relentless and will not change its established course due to the protests of one or two countries. Examining the U.S.'s vigorous implementation of the silver policy and its collection of global silver reserves, it is nothing more than a response to the global economic downturn. Countries have erected strict tariff barriers, and domestic unemployment is severe, with industry and commerce declining. To alleviate the domestic economic downturn and promote domestic industry and commerce, the rise in silver prices would increase the cost of goods in silver-using countries like China and Mexico, making it difficult to transport and sell them to the U.S. Even Japan, due to its purchase of Chinese raw materials, has seen its costs increase invisibly, indirectly affecting its exports to the U.S. This allows the United States to improve its international trade, and citizens who rely on foreign goods will switch to domestic products. Conversely, the cost of U.S. domestic goods will decrease, making exports more prosperous. The United States can then reap the benefits and complete its industrial and commercial revitalization plan. This is one reason. The global situation is precarious. Since Germany disregarded the Treaty of Versailles and expanded its military, the situation has become increasingly urgent, with a palpable sense of imminent conflict. The next world war seems unavoidable, and the country with the strongest financial resources will have an advantage, as evidenced by the First World War. The United States is storing large quantities of gold and silver with a far-reaching plan in mind. During wartime, economic hardship is inevitable, and silver is easier to distribute. Its turnover rate will be higher than gold. Therefore, the U.S. is raising silver prices at all costs, implementing its silver policy to attempt to control the world's economy. To cope with this complex situation, we can only find our own path. At the very least, we must first understand the impact of the silver policy on our country. A brief overview is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Financial Market: China uses silver as its standard currency, and fluctuations in international silver prices affect the value of our currency. A sudden rise in silver prices leads to an outflow of silver, a shortage of funds in the market, monetary tightening, credit contraction, and increased interest rates. The financial sector adopts a cautious attitude towards lending to industry and commerce, leading to instability in the industrial and commercial sectors. The financial market is thus unable to stabilize, as evidenced by the financial panic in China last year and the crisis before the end of April this year.</p>
<p>(2) International Trade: Since countries on the gold standard abandoned it and devalued their currencies, the exchange rate of foreign currencies has fallen, making imported foreign goods expensive and difficult to sell. At the same time, the prices of our country's exports have fallen, reducing exports. To pay for this international trade deficit, a large amount of silver flows out. On the one hand, our country's export trade must calculate the value of foreign currencies based on their high or low exchange rates. If the value of foreign currencies falls, our country's exchange rate rises, and our country's exporters suffer losses due to the low exchange rate when foreign currencies are converted back home. Exports become increasingly sluggish. Therefore, silver outflow is conditioned on a trade deficit, and a trade deficit inevitably leads to silver outflow. The two are interlinked. China's trade deficit over the years has caused silver to flow out uncontrollably.</p>
<p>(3) Central Finance: The largest source of central government revenue is customs duties, which are levied based on the gold standard. If silver prices rise sharply, the amount of gold coins converted into silver coins will inevitably decrease significantly. This will undoubtedly cause difficulties in repaying domestic debt and raising military and administrative expenses. Moreover, import taxes based on quantity are only subject to losses from the gold and silver conversion rate, while import taxes based on value are subject to both declining prices and conversion losses. The central government's losses are substantial.</p>
<p>(4) Manufacturing Industry: China's industry is still in its infancy. This blow makes it difficult to gain a foothold. Emerging industries such as rubber, matches, and cigarettes have reduced production or even stopped production altogether. Large-scale silk and textile industries are facing a bleak situation, with production reductions and shutdowns occurring across the board. In the past, foreign merchants relied on their strong capital, making it difficult for Chinese manufacturers to resist. Now, with rising silver prices and cheap foreign goods, aggressive dumping is destroying China's industry as expected.</p>
<p>Regarding countermeasures, we should start by preventing silver outflow, reducing trade deficits, promoting domestic goods, and boosting production. A detailed description is as follows:</p>
<p>A. Preventing Silver Outflow: The U.S.'s silver purchase plan has repeatedly intensified, increasing the price from every ounce to 77.57 cents, and there is still a trend to continue raising it to $1.29. According to statements by powerful members of the silver faction in Congress, they will make further efforts to raise the silver price to $2.18. If their attempt succeeds, the disruption to the world's financial market will be unimaginable. As a silver-using country, China is no exception. To complete their plan, the silver faction will continue to raise silver prices to actively purchase silver abroad. China's silver is flowing out like water downhill, which is an inevitable trend. The government has taken precautions, but to thoroughly prevent silver outflow, the government should set a price to purchase it. Around January of this year, the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications released more than 20,000 bars of pure gold and purchased 20 million yuan of silver from Hong Kong. In February, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee purchased 3 million yuan of silver from the London market. How this silver purchase policy should continue relentlessly should also be an effective way to prevent silver outflow.</p>
<p>B. Reducing Trade Deficits: Last year, the declared exports of silver totaled 260 million yuan, of which more than 90% was flowed out by foreign merchants and banks. The outflow of large amounts of silver by foreign merchants and banks is to pay for the international trade deficit over the years. Therefore, seeking a balance in international trade is the most effective way to prevent silver outflow. As for how to seek stable international trade and reduce trade deficits, the Ministries of Industry, Diplomacy, and Finance met on May 6th to discuss it. The fundamental solution is to maintain domestic industry so that production can be self-sufficient, and to pay attention to overseas markets to expand sales channels. An international trade committee should be organized by relevant ministries and commissions to study solutions. The government is actively taking steps to reduce the trade deficit. China's trade deficit over the years is due to the excessively low import tax rates on foreign goods, allowing them to be dumped at low prices. Conversely, the exports of domestic goods have decreased. Furthermore, due to China's backward production, it has failed to satisfy people's desire to purchase, so foreign goods are imported endlessly. To reduce the trade deficit, domestic industry should be encouraged and export taxes should be reduced. The Ministry of Finance is drafting measures to reduce export taxes and is preparing to implement them, which will be realized soon. To encourage domestic industry, import tax rates should be increased for foreign goods that can be replaced by domestic goods to resist their import. On the other hand, dumping taxes should be implemented to prevent the dumping of foreign goods, which would be very effective.</p>
<p>C. Promoting Domestic Goods: Rural bankruptcy, capital concentration in cities, huge trade deficits, and massive silver outflow—in the final analysis, the failure to purchase domestic goods is the root cause. Decades ago, the amount of the trade deficit was only several million, then tens of millions, and now tens of billions. If a rescue is not sought urgently, then China, with its vast territory and abundant resources, will inevitably see its national economy collapse and move towards ultimate demise. Some may believe that China's trade deficit has existed for a long time, while rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial decline are recent conditions, assuming that the two are not related. But in previous years, the assets that flowed out mostly remained in China, created by loans from foreign merchants and banks or investments from foreign merchants. Thus, the wounds could be concealed. Now, with the U.S. raising silver prices and the pursuit of profit, silver is flowing out in large quantities. The so-called accumulated illness of several years has erupted in one day. If domestic goods could be promoted early on and waste reduced, then how could rural areas go bankrupt, and how could capital be concentrated in cities, or even if it were concentrated in cities, it would not flow overseas. China is an agricultural country, but the annual import of foreign rice has become a major import. Other foreign textiles have penetrated rural areas, and the sales channels for domestic textiles have become sluggish. China has merely become the end of the line for the promotion of rice and foreign textiles. This phenomenon is extremely dangerous. To save the situation, domestic goods should be promoted. If the government promotes domestic goods from above and the people implement them from below, why is there still little effect to this day? In short, it is because there is a lack of perseverance. We must be determined to persistently refuse to use foreign goods and not purchase them in large quantities simply because they are cheap. If there are domestic goods that can replace foreign goods, then we should try to improve their technology and vigorously promote their sales. For those without substitutes, experts should carefully study them to imitate them, working hard and diligently over time. Then, the foundation of domestic goods will be solid. How can there be dumping due to silver prices rising and foreign goods becoming cheaper? D. Promoting Production: To develop a country's economy, it must first increase its citizens' purchasing power. The U.S.'s silver policy also uses raising the purchasing power of the East as its slogan. Therefore, the fundamental method for dealing with rising silver prices is to effectively increase the purchasing power of the Chinese people. The method is to promote production. To promote production: (1) Revitalize rural areas. 80% of China's population is farmers, and the raw materials imported from abroad over the years are mostly agricultural products. Rice, wheat, and cotton textiles account for the majority. The capital currently concentrated in cities should be distributed to rural areas to revitalize them, thereby increasing their purchasing power and promoting the development of domestic goods manufacturers. (2) Develop transportation to facilitate the promotion of domestic products and adjust their surpluses and deficits. The development of highways has been rapid in recent years, allowing goods to flow smoothly and stabilizing prices, which indirectly promotes the development of industry and thereby prevents the outflow of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e172">To What Extent Will the United States Raise Silver Prices? <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>In the past two years, the most active endeavor of the United States in monetary policy has probably been raising silver prices. Clearly, the motivation for raising silver prices has economic and political effects, although in justice, it is rather unfair to countries like China and South America, intensifying their suffering. "But to what extent will the United States raise silver prices?" Everyone is concerned about this question. This article aims to find an answer, even if it is not an absolutely correct one—perhaps it will not be a futile attempt!</p>
<p>"Remembering the past is a guide to the future." Let us look back at the history of the United States raising silver prices. The beginning of raising silver prices was the Thomas Amendment in the Agricultural Relief Act. It stipulated that the United States could accept silver as repayment of war debts, but the amount was limited to $200 million, with each ounce valued at 50 cents. European debtor nations originally produced very little silver, and their silver reserves were also very limited, so although the United States had this permission, it had little practical effect. The next was the London Silver Agreement, which stipulated that the United States should purchase 24.4 million ounces of silver annually, but there was no provision for the purchase price (the original intention of the agreement was to have the United States purchase at the then-current market price, not to raise the purchase price). When the United States passed the bill on December 21, 1933, it decided that the purchase price of silver would be 64.25 cents per ounce. From this time on, the price of silver gradually increased. Later, the Silver Purchase Act of June 19, 1934, stipulated that the Treasury's gold and silver holdings should constitute a ratio of 75% to 25%. At that time, if calculated at 50 cents per ounce (because the market price had not yet risen to 64.25 cents at the time), then the United States would still need to purchase 1.3 billion ounces. This was followed by the Silver Nationalization Act of August 9, which stipulated the purchase of domestic silver at 50.01 cents. Under these two measures, the price of silver skyrocketed; the outflow of silver from China was also most intense at this time.</p>
<p>The White House authorities have expended great effort to implement the aforementioned steps. However, the increase in silver prices, in the eyes of the silver faction in Congress, was like a snail's pace—too slow and circuitous. Therefore, Pittman, Wheeler, Thomas, White, and others often made speeches criticizing the government, saying that "the purchase of silver has not fulfilled its duty." Until the end of last year, if the United States wanted to increase its silver holdings to constitute a ratio of 25% to 75% with gold, it would still need to purchase 1.1 billion ounces. Assuming that the average annual silver production is 180 million ounces (according to Edward Kann's estimate, see Finance and Commerce I May, 1935), and assuming that other supplies are absorbed by industrial use, then the United States would have to spend seven years to complete this task. The criticism from the silver faction in Congress, which represents the interests of mine owners, is also quite reasonable. To make them wait seven long years—not seven months! What is even more disheartening is that next year is the period for the presidential election, and no one dares to guarantee that "Franklin" will be re-elected. The former President Hoover, who is in opposition, is often complaining and declaring that the United States should best restore the gold standard. Once Hoover takes the stage again, will the seven-year long-term silver purchase plan not be overturned? No one knows if the price of $1.2919 will ever be realized. Therefore, the silver faction in Congress made every effort to demand that the government take a stronger attitude towards the silver policy, and the government was forced to raise the silver purchase price to 71.11 cents on April 10, 1935, and again to 77.57 cents on April 24. For a time, the world silver market was stirred by it. The governments of Mexico and Peru successively banned silver exports, and the suffering of China was even deeper, needless to say. It is said that in the near future (tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, it may be said), the silver purchase price will be raised again, which is very likely. The United States has long arranged the procedure for raising the silver purchase price, and the unit of increase is 5%. Observe the table on the left:</p>
<p>Coinage Profit　Silver Purchase Price (Unit: Cents)</p>
<p>45%　77.11</p>
<p>40%　77.57</p>
<p>35%　84.03</p>
<p>30%　90.50</p>
<p>25%　96.96</p>
<p>20%　103.43</p>
<p>15%　116.36</p>
<p>5%　122.82</p>
<p>0　129.29</p>
<p>This procedure of gradually reducing coinage profit (Seigniorage Profit), which is the procedure for raising silver prices, has already been implemented to the second step. The remaining steps will eventually be put into practice sooner or later. The focus of the debate now is: should the price be gradually raised step by step according to the original plan, or should it be raised to $1.2929 in one fell swoop? Only the silver faction in Congress knows about this, and the author does not dare to guess blindly. However, we can predict that if the price of silver really rises to $1.2929, the mine owners, who never dislike making money, will definitely have demands for even higher prices. According to recent telegrams, some members of Congress even proposed that the price of silver should be raised to $2.18 per ounce. Their reasoning is: "The Treasury's existing silver holdings, calculated at $1.29 per ounce, are worth approximately $1.45 billion. If calculated at $2.18, it would be $2.45 billion. At that point, the Treasury would only need to purchase $415 million worth of silver to establish a ratio of 3:1.—Shen Bao, 3rd of this month. This proposal also has the possibility of being passed, because on the one hand, the mine owners do not have to wait for a long seven years and can immediately enjoy the high price of $2.18; on the other hand, the duplicate standard of "two drunkards walking close together"—to use W. Kammerer's words—can descend upon Uncle Sam's house. From this point of view, the silver faction in Congress is like a black whirlwind, wishing that the price of silver would immediately rise to $1.19, then to $2.18, and then to...</p>
<p>However, we must doubt that raising silver prices in such an artificial way will naturally allow mine owners and speculators to obtain considerable benefits, but it is not necessarily of much benefit to the entire U.S. national economy. As a certain U.S. monetary expert said, the actual price of silver is only 25 cents, and excessive increases will inevitably lead to a reaction and a fall. Isn't the recent decline in the silver markets in New York, London, and Bombay a good example? The higher the price of silver rises, the more severe the reaction will be, which only benefits speculators. We do not understand why the silver faction in Congress and the White House authorities are doing such a stupid thing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the United States' gold is also increasing day by day (this is due to the Favorable Balance of Trade and debt repayments, etc.), and silver is difficult to catch up with it. At the end of February, the Treasury's gold holdings were $7,593,721,000. In mid-March, they increased to $7,600,010,000. At the end of March, they increased further to $7,654,034,000 (according to the Federal Reserve Bulletin, Apr. 1935). Furthermore, according to the Shen Bao's Washington dispatch on May 9: "On May 6, the U.S. Treasury's gold holdings actually increased to $8,725,313,788, while silver holdings were only $1,500,000,000." Perhaps the United States will increase the price of silver to around $3 because the increase in silver is too slow—this is also very possible!</p>
<p>Under the threat of another sharp rise in silver prices, China suffers the most, followed by Mexico and Peru. At the end of last month, the Mexican government implemented a new monetary system policy, banning the export of silver coins and replacing various silver coins with paper money. All banks have been ordered to suspend business for a week. On the other hand, they have nationalized existing silver and will set a new exchange rate of three yuan and five jiao for one U.S. dollar. The Mexican authorities' flexibility in handling affairs is truly admirable. Regarding the situation in Peru, the Shanghai Daily News on May 5 had the following record: "The Peruvian government, in order to prevent the melting of silver coins, has banned exports this month. The government has ordered the nationalization of domestic silver production and has adopted a silver export license system." It seems that even small countries are unwilling to lag behind in dealing with currency wars.</p>
<p>What about our China? We originally had a good weapon—the equalization tax—but we have not been able to make good use of it. The difference between the London silver price and the Shanghai silver price these days is about 36%, but the equalization tax is always lazy and does not move—6.75%! Short-sighted financiers and theorists believe that besides extending foreign exchange, there is no possibility of silver export. The "Gentlemen's Agreement" between Chinese and foreign banks on the 16th of last month was really because foreign banks had no silver, so they had to flirt with each other. Honestly speaking, there will not be any changes in the short term. At the same time, the Shanghai Daily News also said on May 7. "Silver flowing out of Manchuria via the Korean Railway has reached a large sum of 35,000,000 yuan in the past week. The puppet government of Manchukuo has also adopted a passport system." It can be said that it is completely thanks to the United States for this increase in silver prices. Continuing to follow the old path without making progress is not a solution!</p>
<h3 id="e173">Prospects for Overseas Silk Markets <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>Our country has always been known throughout the world for its silk production. Unfortunately, there has been no attempt at improvement. For decades, silk-making machinery has stubbornly adhered to old methods. As a result, this only export capable of offsetting huge import surpluses has been seized by the Japanese and abandoned by the United States, a major user of silk. Isn't this a lamentable situation? Now, this great dream is beginning to awaken, and efforts are being made to revive the industry. It may not be too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. However, given the increasingly fierce competition in international industrial economics, the future still feels chilling. Last year, the consumption of raw silk in the United States saw an increase. On the surface, it seems that silk-producing countries in the East have a chance of recovery. However, a closer examination of the details may not warrant optimism.</p>
<p>U.S. Raw Silk Consumption Statistics for 1934 (Unit: bales)</p>
<p>Japanese Silk  European Silk Chinese Silk Total</p>
<p>January  39,296 330 1,316 40,942</p>
<p>February  37,991 98 932 39,021</p>
<p>March  41,815 615 650 44,080</p>
<p>April  36,324 434 634 37,392</p>
<p>May  37,919 352 469 38,740</p>
<p>June  32,162 395 512 32,079</p>
<p>July  29,418 1,063 1,540 32,021</p>
<p>August  34,907 546 794 36,147</p>
<p>September 31,399 111 1,089 31,599</p>
<p>October  47,687 625 794 49,106</p>
<p>November  36,528 367 653 37,548</p>
<p>December  39,558 450 933 40,941</p>
<p>Total  446,004 5,386 10,316 461,706</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, the consumption of raw silk in the United States is on the path to progress. Compared to December of the previous year, with 26,959 bales consumed, last year's consumption has indeed increased significantly. However, the price of silk in New York often fluctuates between $1.10 and $1.20 USD. It was not until mid-November that it showed a brief surge, followed by a decline, and it remains around $1.20. The mystery behind this lies in the manipulation by American and Japanese silk merchants, which is not difficult to investigate. The reason why the consumption of raw silk in the United States gradually turned around last year is due to silk merchants spending huge sums of money on various promotions, showcasing the features of pure silk products, and emphasizing the economic benefits of buying genuine silk products, which aroused public attention and boosted sales. Lower prices were also a contributing factor. However, the main reason is the sudden decrease in the production of rayon. In 1934, the total production of rayon in the United States was 190,000,000 pounds, compared to 207,580,000 pounds in 1933, a decrease of 17,580,000 pounds, which translates to approximately 130,000 bales of raw silk. The sales of silk fabrics in the United States can be said to be increasing daily. If not for the major threat of rayon, the production of raw silk could have unlimited development. The reason for the short production of rayon in other countries is neither a shortage of raw materials nor other significant obstacles. So, what is the reason? Modern commercial competition has very clever tricks. Would rayon merchants sit idly by and do nothing in the face of actions detrimental to them by silk merchants? Talented people versed in the mechanics are setting up new machinery for their capitalists, so that the products are improved, the cost is reduced, and some have invented wood pulp raw materials, which can save 50% of the original cost, and so on. Therefore, whether the United States will be able to continue to consume large amounts of raw silk in the future is still worth studying.</p>
<p>Japanese silk prices are expected to rise due to reduced autumn cocoon harvests and bullish sentiment in Yokohama. If it were before last year, Japanese silk could have sailed smoothly last year and obtained satisfactory returns. However, due to the relationship with rayon, they have to obey the trend of the New York market and dare not raise their prices too high. They truly deserve to be called experts in observing the situation in the world market.</p>
<p>Japanese cocoons and silk are so cheap that farmers are complaining endlessly. Although they receive various subsidies from the government, it is still of no avail. Last year, the total income of silkworm farmers was 197,290,000 Japanese yen, only one-third of the previous year's income, and the lowest new record in the past ten years since farmers engaged in silkworm farming.</p>
<p>The United States consumes 96.6% of Japan's total silk production, but Japan's silk production is still excessive. Therefore, all silk-consuming countries in the world have traces of dumping. Even India and Australia, which have backward production, have now successfully entered their markets. The following is a list of their export quantities last year for reference:</p>
<p>Japanese Silk Export Quantity Statistics for 1934</p>
<p>Unit: bales Value (Japanese Yen)</p>
<p>Exports to the US 433,437 244,379,365</p>
<p>Exports to France 36,574 20,333,890</p>
<p>Exports to the UK 23,878 14,237,056</p>
<p>Exports to India 4,066 1,789,033</p>
<p>Exports to Others 8,943 6,054,531</p>
<p>Total 505,998 286,793,875</p>
<p>Last year, the selling price of Japanese silk was very low. The highest price in the Yokohama market (based on the B grade standard) was 675 yen in mid-February, and the lowest was 437.5 yen in September. Compared with the previous year's highest price of 1,090 yen and the lowest price of 520 yen, the difference is indeed alarming. Fortunately, its exchange rate with the United States is controlled by the government and is often between 28.3 and 28.55, so its silk-making business, although in great difficulty, has not been particularly affected, which is also a good phenomenon in misfortune.</p>
<p>Japanese merchants began to hope for a rise in silk prices at the beginning of December last year, but they have not yet achieved their wishes. However, they have never forgotten this. Therefore, in the three months since spring, the United States has consumed more than 44,000 bales per month, while Japan's monthly shipments to the United States are only more than 30,000 bales. It can be seen that the Japanese intend to reduce New York's inventory and use the air of insufficient domestic supply as a smokescreen to compensate for their long-cherished wish. This is also the reason for the sudden activity in overseas markets recently.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, so most transactions were temporarily suspended. Only the money market had some activity. The foreign exchange lending rate in the market was the same as in recent days. The morning and afternoon rates were still 12 cents. The morning session saw over 3.3 million in transfer transactions and over 600,000 in new transactions. There were no transactions in the afternoon session. The Small General Association saw 400,000 in transactions. The total value of circulating banknotes issued was over 1.1 million, and the value of secretly marked banknotes was over 400,000. Money shops collected over 19 million in foreign public receipts. Other transactions, such as bank collections and clearinghouse transactions, were suspended as usual due to Sunday. Although there were slight changes in the subsidiary currency market, they were minimal. The opening prices for small silver coins from Jiangnan were both 833 yuan in the morning and afternoon, down 8 jiao from the previous session, with only 4,000 jiao transacted in the morning session and none in the afternoon session. Small silver coins from Guangdong opened at 734 yuan 3 jiao in the morning, up 3 jiao, but fell back 1 jiao in the afternoon to 734 yuan 2 jiao, resulting in a net increase of 2 jiao from the previous market.

<p>Last week, from May 6th to May 11th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only conducted five days of trading, excluding the May 9th Memorial Day market closure. The market conditions were generally lackluster. The stagnation of market prices and the light trading volume were unprecedented in recent years. Although the depressed environment was one reason for this situation, the lack of loans, the financial crisis, and the commercial depression did not reduce public anxiety. Many asset holders, given the volatility of the financial sector and the unpredictable changes in the future, are now shifting to purchasing public bonds. However, most investments are not enthusiastic due to the limited interest earned on holdings. Speculators also refrained from action due to the lack of opportunity. Under these market conditions, prices naturally tended towards stagnation, with no changes. As a result, trading volume also decreased sharply. However, this state of numbness has lasted for a long time, and once changes occur, they will be more intense. Last week, only the 96 Public Bonds were relatively active, and trading volume was also higher. In addition, various bonds were almost completely stagnant. The daily situation was the same, with price fluctuations never exceeding 2 jiao. The day with the least trading volume only had a little over 3 million. In general, the final market prices were slightly better by 5 fen, 1 jiao, or 2 jiao, while 96 bonds were slightly lower by about 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was 25,273,000 yuan, of which 96 bonds accounted for 10,520,000 yuan. The comparison table of the price changes is listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened lower due to selling by foreign merchants, especially those from Mainland China and Bombay. Bulls took profits, and prices for all months fell by 5 to 7 points. Subsequently, due to good local demand and government purchases of futures cotton to offset sales of stockpiled cotton, prices rebounded. The number of sellers gradually increased as prices approached 12 cents. At the same time, buyers were hesitant, fearing increased movements in the interior. Closing prices were firm. Spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 1 to 5 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures prices rose by 5 to 6 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by speculative buyers and rising silver prices, but later declined due to selling by Japanese merchants. Pingguo'er rose by 1.75 to 2.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 1 to 5.5 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1.2 to 1.5 rupees. The original telegram record is as follows (May 10th telegram):</p>

<p>The outflow of white tung oil from Hankou foreign firms continues unabated, and the market fluctuates constantly. This is because foreign firms' purchases fluctuate daily, causing prices to rise and fall frequently. At the end of last week, the situation looked weak, but after entering this week, it suddenly increased to over 40 yuan per dan, and the day before yesterday it fell back to 39 yuan 4 jiao, but last night's telegram showed it rising again to 40 yuan. Foreign trade is prone to rise and fall, so a fluctuation of one or two yuan is not surprising. As for the source of supply, foreign firms also purchase in the producing areas, and Sichuan tung oil is shipped directly from Wanxian to Shanghai for transshipment, bypassing Hankou for a long time. Therefore, most of the tung oil arriving in Hankou is inferior tung oil. Xiang tung oil from Changde also has foreign firms purchasing, and the prosperity of Hankou is no longer what it used to be. Even though the quantity of tung oil produced in various producing areas increases annually, Hankou's volume decreases year by year. This is because transportation has gradually reached the interior, and foreign merchants' purchases have also penetrated into the producing areas. Although Hankou is a native product market in our country, holding the north-south hub, with the rapid progress of transportation, the market is becoming increasingly scattered. It can be seen that market changes are rapid and change with transportation. In the future, it may transfer to Shanghai, which is also unknown. According to details in recent letters from Hankou, the opening price for Xiang tung oil from brokers is 23 taels to 23 taels 12 qian, and the quantity is also small. The tung oil exported from this port mainly comes from Zhejiang province. The quantity has increased sharply in the past two years, mainly due to sluggish domestic sales, forcing sales to foreign countries. However, the quality of the products produced last winter is insufficient, so selecting goods for export inevitably requires careful consideration.</p>

<p>Due to the softening of prices in Qingdao, buyers here are waiting and watching, hoping for a further decline. However, sellers, facing gradually declining inventories, insist on not lowering prices. Therefore, quoted prices are high, resulting in no transactions. According to insiders, all existing inventory may be difficult to replenish in the future.</p>

<p>The quantity of lead purchased by tea shops recently has not been large, so there have not been many transactions in the market. Paint companies and yellow dan factories have also reduced purchases due to sluggish sales. There were few transactions in the city, but more goods arrived from overseas, resulting in an increasingly saturated market. Standards therefore have no new developments, and the price remains around 14 yuan per dan for cash. For bulk transactions, the price may be cheaper by one or two jiao. It is said that only one or two hundred bars were sold in the market yesterday, all of which were purchased by small customers. Manufacturers only inquired about prices.</p>

<p>— (Xu Jie)</p>
<p>A person born into this world cannot be thorough in everything. To be thorough is to be unable to live as a person.</p>
<p>In water and air, there are countless microorganisms that can transmit diseases and kill people. If a person is thoroughly fastidious about hygiene, they would not dare to drink water or breathe air. How could they live as a person?</p>
<p>People from birth to youth, to adulthood, to old age, eventually die. Through decades of hot and cold, joys and sorrows, partings and reunions, birth, aging, sickness and death, it is truly like a dream. If you think about it thoroughly, would you still be willing to live as a person?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Clear water has no fish." To hate evil like an enemy, to be the only one sober in a drunken crowd, to seek perfection in everything in the current era, to be thorough in everything, will inevitably lead to running into walls everywhere. How could you live as a person?</p>
<p>Sugar tastes sweet, but saccharin becomes bitter. People should be "good," but "too good" people turn into "bad" people. Therefore, in life, one cannot be too thorough. Always go with the flow, and it is good to be "rarely confused"!</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Cherries Are Red <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— One Heart</p>
<p>— Written for Mother's Day, May 12th —</p>
<p>I happened to take a copy of Bai Xiangshan's Ci Poetry from the bookshelf and turned to a poem by Jiang Jie, "A piece of spring sorrow is poured with wine. The boat rocks on the river. The curtain招招 on the building. Qiu Niang is graceful and Tai Niang is charming. The wind is blowing, the rain is pouring. When will the cloud sail be unloaded at Pu Bridge? The silver-character zheng is tuned. The heart-character incense burns. Time easily throws people away. The cherries are red. The bananas are green." I couldn't help but feel a little gloomy.</p>
<p>It was in the late spring three years ago when I was eating the first red cherry that the news of my mother's serious illness came to me. But when I rushed home, my mother was already lying quietly on the wooden board. Besides her last crystal tear, which was still hanging in her sunken eye socket, as if to replace comfort, I could no longer hear her say, "Zhen'er, you're back. Are you hungry?"</p>
<p>My mother was indeed a typical virtuous mother. She had the willpower of a shrewd and capable person. On her thin face, there was always an expression of love. Although my father abandoned us for a mistress when we were young, my mother still harmoniously raised us and prevented our fragile and innocent childhood from being covered with some sorrowful tunes.</p>
<p>I still remember very clearly that every night before going to bed, we always tugged at my mother's skirt, asking her to tell us an anecdote about an ancient filial son or hero. Of course, she never refused, and she would tell us with such spirit, making us forget all our pain and fatigue.</p>
<p>Sometimes my sister and I would fall asleep in my mother's tragic singing. Undoubtedly, countless tears were hidden in this forced laughter.</p>
<p>"Time easily throws people away." The season of sending spring has come again. When the first cherry of the market reflects in my eyes, I think of my only dear mother again. She has been dead for three years. In these short two years, who knew that your unprogressive son has been driven by life into a wreck full of wounds? Alas, mother!</p>

<p>"Star Shift Field" is a common saying in Suzhou. On a clear summer night, we cool off in the courtyard and look up at the bright Milky Way, with its many stars scattered here and there. The light is bright and beautiful. Suddenly, a line of light flashes past like lightning. Looking closely, it turns out that a star has moved its position. According to ancient legend, this is the so-called "Star Shift Field."</p>
<p>What I am talking about now is not the "Star Shift Field" in the sky, but the migration of the Shanghai Star Film Company's factory site. The lease of the old site of the Star Company on Pushi Road has expired. They wanted to relocate to a better place. After a long search, they found a piece of land near Xujiahui Road near Fenglin Bridge in western Shanghai. It just so happened that it was next to the former municipal government. There are secluded trees and green grass, as well as three tall foreign-style houses, covering an area of ​​more than 30 acres. The two planned photography fields are about to start construction.</p>
<p>Half a month ago, the workers had already moved many props by truckload. The day before yesterday, although a housewarming ceremony was held, the office had not yet moved.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the housewarming day, more than 300 male and female stars and all employees took a car in a line to reach the gate of the new company. Ten thousand firecrackers and Gaosheng fireworks went off, and the sound almost deafened everyone. After the colleagues entered the ceremony hall to participate in the ceremony, they also inspected the area for a week and felt that the place was three times larger than the old site. Everyone enjoyed some refreshments and dispersed in the misty evening.</p>

<p>This isn't because the local authorities don't scrutinize teachers; fundamentally, it's because the inland areas lack such talent. If we don't use these people who remember old books, I'm afraid there will be no one to teach. Therefore, some young people in the area, planning for their own future and the literacy of the locals, don't make any grand plans. They run to the county elementary school, muddle through for two or three years, learn some geography, history, arithmetic, and writing, and then they can go to the countryside to lead those who are illiterate. This is unavoidable. I ask you, who, truly trained as an elementary school teacher, would be willing to go to the countryside to earn two dollars a month? So the difficulty of teacher resources is definitely not just a problem of one county. It depends on how the provincial education authorities come up with a complete plan to revitalize it, so that there is hope of getting on the right track.</p>
<p>In Xi'an city, they have already set up an elementary school teacher "training center." Perhaps in a year or two, these difficult situations can be gradually reduced. After listening, Zhiqian stood up and slapped himself on the head a couple of times, laughing: "Should be hit, should be hit! I've been a county magistrate in Shaanxi for half a year, but I didn't realize that lower-level education had such difficulties. This county magistrate of mine should have taken off his black gauze hat long ago, why wait until today to get a reprimand and resign?" Zhiqian laughed: "Let's not talk about it anymore, talking back and forth will only arouse County Magistrate Zhou's complaints again. Probably that Miss Zhu has changed into her fanciest clothes and left long ago. The door isn't locked, I should go back and take a look. Beihai, why don't you come to my room? Let me give you extra lessons." When Beihai heard this, he picked up his schoolbag and stood up. Zhou Yourong was talking with great enthusiasm, and their sudden departure was quite disappointing, but it was not appropriate to force them to stay and chat. (202)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because these dogs are all very small in size, they definitely cannot guard at night or do other work. They can only be cuddled in the arms or held in the hands as a small toy to play with. Later, after we entered the Pass, almost all Manchurian families kept this kind of dog, and we all lived in the capital. Therefore, when outsiders saw this kind of dog, they all called it the Pekingese. Now it is called by its name. 1</p>
<p>What was this imperial dog house like? Of course, it was not some deep palace hall—but its scale was vastly different from ordinary people's dog houses. Its format also imitated the palace, but was only a few times smaller. Its building materials were not wood or stone, but all made of bamboo heads. There were also four eunuchs managing these dogs, one was considered the leading chief, and the other three were his assistants. They also stayed in the palace all year round, not asking about other matters, only accompanying those puppies. Although they were ordered to manage these dogs, they could not really be said to "manage" them, but only to "serve" them. How dare they easily beat or scold them, they could only serve them carefully.</p>
<p>When our group was about to approach the dog house, an eunuch tending the dogs saw us and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"The Empress Dowager has arrived!" He shouted very loudly and slowly, almost one word at a time. (312)</p>
<h3 id="e188">Leftovers <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>

<p>Whether in the afternoon or evening, after the meal bell rings every day, there are always many people waiting at the gate of the neighboring school. Among those people, there are men, there are women, there are old, and there are young. They either carry broken baskets, or hold tile bowls, or take teacups, mostly dressed in incomplete coarse clothes, with sallow complexions and thin bodies; they are poor people living near that school.</p>
<p>After a while, a person from the school came out carrying a shoulder pole; behind him, there was another person following. The noisy situation began like this. When the shoulder pole carrier rested at the school gate, those people with dripping saliva swarmed forward. Some contribute one copper coin, some contribute three copper coins, some even contribute as much as six copper coins—this is probably the largest number. Then one person collects the money, announcing the numbers aloud; another person bends down, holding an iron scoop in hand, like Chen Ping dividing meat, distributing the leftovers in the pole to those poor people according to the amount of copper coins. Those who complain about too little, stretch out their dirty hands, and take one or two handfuls from the pole; the person guarding the pole does not stop them. There are also those who come late, carrying disappointed emotions, and returning empty-handed.</p>
<p>So what are those leftovers? There are meat bones, there are fish bones, there are vegetables, there is tofu. In short, they are leftover things; to put it nicely, you can call it a big mix. However, those who buy leftovers truly treat it as a big mix: if they occasionally get a piece of fish tail, they are very happy, saying that it can be used to cook noodles. After the leftovers are all bought up, the cook counts the copper coins, and sometimes frowns and says: "The capital for buying Chao cigarettes is not enough!"</p>
<p>After that time, what is parked at the door is a chartered car.</p>

<h3 id="e189">A Brief Account of the Historical Sites of the Confucius Temple in Qufu <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Nanggongsheng</p>
<p>Qufu in Shandong is the hometown of the Most Sage Teacher Confucius. Confucius is the master of literature in our country, that is, the most sacred person who promotes our culture. His hometown, the cultural memorial sites about him, are naturally countless. Therefore, people who go to Qufu must go to admire the relics of this eternal master of literature to broaden their knowledge. From Qufu Station to Qufu City, there is a distance of eighteen li. This is because Confucius' tomb, the Confucius Forest, is three li away from the city. If the station were too close, it would shake the Confucius Forest. This is also an expression of respect for the sage. From Qufu Station to the "Dacheng Hall" in the city, the historical sites I heard about at the Confucius Temple can be briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Queli... Queli is where Confucius lived in Qufu City. Everyone who has read the Four Books knows that it is a short alley on the right side of the current Confucius Temple gate. There is a wooden archway across the street with the two large characters "Queli" written on it, so that people can know that they have arrived at Confucius' former residence at first glance.</p>
<p>Apricot Altar... Confucius taught at the Apricot Altar, with a thousand disciples, which is a famous story throughout the ages. Entering the gate of the Confucius Temple, the first thing you see is the Apricot Altar, about five or six zhang in size. It is a pavilion-like house, but the front is open and there are no windows. It is only a little over a chi high, reached by stone steps. In the center of the top is a golden "Apricot Altar" horizontal plaque. Two stone tablets are erected in the altar. This Apricot Altar is said to be where Confucius taught.</p>
<p>Confucius' Hand-Planted Cypress... It is a cypress tree that Confucius himself planted with his own eyes when he was alive, but now, only a section of dead wood, a relic, remains.</p>
<p>Dacheng Hall... The Dacheng Hall is the main hall of the Confucius Temple, the main hall for worshiping Confucius. Outside the hall are stone pillars with dragons coiled around them, very solemn. In the center of the hall is a statue of Confucius, about two zhang in height. Standing on both sides are the statues of Yanzi, Zisi, Mencius, and Zengzi, which are the four sages who are paired for worship. On both sides of the four sages are the statues of disciples such as Zilu and Zigong, all gilded and dazzling, making people feel respectful. On the top of the hall are plaques bestowed by emperors of past dynasties. The height of the hall is as much as seven or eight zhang. Looking at the plaque above, the hat on your head has to fall to the ground, which shows how high the hall is.</p>
<p>Hall of Grandmother Kong... The Hall of Grandmother Kong is the hall for worshiping Confucius' wife. The buildings and facilities are all secondary to the Dacheng Hall. Only the stone pillars outside the hall are also coiled with golden dragons. Inside the hall is a statue of Confucius' wife.</p>
<p>Hall of Sacred Traces... The last hall is called the Hall of Sacred Traces. Inside are seventy-two famous paintings, all stories of Confucius, from Confucius' birth to his death. These famous stories of his life are all inside. After seeing them, you can know a brief history of Confucius' life. The sacred traces pictures are sold in complete sets in Qufu. In addition to the seventy-two sacred traces pictures, there is also a stone carving of Confucius, which can also be bought in Qufu city.</p>
<p>Zhang Menglong Stele... Many people who write the characters of the Northern Wei Dynasty take the Zhang Menglong Stele as a model. The original Zhang Menglong Stele is also in the Confucius Temple, sealed with vermilion railings. Once a year, the person in charge of the Confucius Temple opens the seal and orders people to take the stele down and sell it to the outside world. Therefore, rubbings of the Zhang Menglong Stele in Qufu can be seen and bought everywhere, and are not very rare.</p>
<p>The above records are just a glimpse of the historical sites of the Confucius Temple. The rest, such as the Qisheng Hall, which enshrines the spirit tablets of Confucius' five generations of ancestors, and the two corridors, which also enshrine the spirit tablets of the seventy-two sages, along with the two-zhang-high stone steles everywhere in the temple, can all be seen. Only the musical instruments in the Confucius Temple and the various objects used for worshiping Confucius occupy a very important position in our country's culture, but they are rarely seen when celebrating Confucius.</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Current Situation and Areas for Improvement in Health Education in Nanjing <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Yunshi</p>
<p>Education in Nanjing is very developed. People who run education generally know that in addition to the intellectual development of children, they also know that physical health and education are equally important. Therefore, the participation of health education in children's lives, affecting the physical and mental health of children in the future, is indeed very meaningful.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Municipal Health Education Committee is tasked with the mission of ensuring the physical health of students. This kind of work is welcomed by society. Therefore, when health education was first started in Nanjing, there were 21 schools. In three or four years, it has gradually increased to more than 120 schools. Now Nanjing has divided these 110+ schools into five districts, one of which is called the School Health Experiment Department, which uses experimental methods to study school health work in order to quickly promote the mission of physical health.</p>
<p>Currently, there are more than 120 schools under the management of the Health Education Committee in Nanjing, with a student population of more than 35,000. Therefore, due to the zonal nature of the work, a new plan has been re-established from the 23rd to the 24th year. His work roughly includes the following five items:</p>
<p>(1) Health Care Work—New student health checkups. Follow-up checks of deficiencies. Correction of deficiencies. Training of hygiene teams. Cleanliness inspections, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Environmental Hygiene—Inspection, reporting, and improvement of two items.</p>
<p>(3) Preparation Work—Vaccination and experimental vaccine injections, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Treatment Work—Diagnosis of minor illnesses and referral of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>(5) Special Work—Such as school health training courses, student family liaison, student family hygiene improvement, etc. (This kind of work is mostly during winter or summer vacation)</p>
<p>The above five work items and periods are generally carried out in accordance with the school student implementation plan stipulated by the Department of Health. The general situation of the doctor's work: the director of the Health Education Committee is directly under the School Health Department of the Department of Health. Most of his work is in administrative aspects. The remaining doctors are probably doing health checkups and treating diseases.</p>
<p>School Health Nurse Work: Every week, nurses take turns going to schools to correct deficiencies (such as trachoma, skin diseases, etc.), give hygiene lectures, do health care work, inspect student cleanliness issues, and improve environmental hygiene.</p>
<p>Student Activities: Morning cleanliness inspection, assisting in correcting deficiencies, first aid work, etc.</p>
<p>Administrative Aspects:</p>
<p>Municipal Government - Health Education Committee (Social Bureau) - Health Office - Education Bureau - School District - School</p>
<p>Economic Sources:</p>
<p>Health Office: 7,200 yuan, Municipal Government: 4,200 yuan, School health expenses: 8,600 yuan, four jiao per person</p>
<p>Equipment Aspects:</p>
<p>Now the schools in Nanjing generally have a health room. Unfortunately, some schools have few houses, so they have a medicine cabinet. The medicine cabinet is very simple, and what is stored inside are some first aid and disinfectant medicines. Hanging on the wall are educational picture books published by the Department of Health, and sometimes there are a few educational photos. The second thing is various records.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the current situation of school health in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Below are the two points I hope to improve:</p>
<p>(1) Even Distribution of Economy: Even distribution of economy is the most important thing. I see that the allocation of funds for health education in Nanjing is too uneven. Looking at one item stipulated in the implementation plan, for example, travel expenses should not exceed 10% at most, but now health education has exceeded 20%. According to the above economic sources, the Health Education Committee's annual income is 20,000 yuan, and in the new plan for the 24th year, 3,270 yuan is prepared for travel expenses. Moreover, most of this money is used for nurses. When nurses travel for a long time, their working hours are reduced. Therefore, I personally hope to increase the number of nurses and replace travel expenses. Why? Suppose the Health Education Association hires six nurses, it will only cost 2,880 yuan (calculated at 40 yuan per person per month), and the remaining 400 yuan will be used for the doctor's travel expenses. I think this will reduce their working range and increase the number of staff, and increasing the time can increase work efficiency. So I always feel that this is better.</p>
<p>(2) Cooperation with Schools: Cooperation between schools in Nanjing and the Health Education Association is a very important issue. I hope that this matter will not cause difficulties for schools and the Health Education Association. Although sometimes, because the Health Education Association's work is not allocated properly, often a school does not have a deficiency correction or other work even once a week, which sometimes can make the school regret it and cause problems of disagreement. Therefore, I personally like to use the method of teaching more, and get close to the principal and students, because with more closeness, there will naturally be opportunities for cooperation. Therefore, many people think that this kind of advocacy is difficult, but in fact, two schools only need to pay 41 yuan, saving two kinds of health education fees; it is still worthwhile. Even the even distribution of economic expenses has a great relationship with cooperation issues.</p>
<p>I have only written out these few points for the plan for improvement, and I hope that the school health teachers will correct me.</p>
<h3 id="e191">A Brief History of School Oral Hygiene in Various Countries (V) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>

<p>School Oral Hygiene in Japan</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, science has prospered, and all industries have advanced rapidly. The development of dental medicine is not only the best in East Asia, but also comparable to Europe and the United States. Therefore, special attention is paid to the oral hygiene movement, especially the oral hygiene of the army and navy, which is more advanced than that of European and American countries. At the time of the Russo-Japanese War, there was already the appointment of dental military doctors. As for school dentistry, in the 35th year of Meiji, the Kojimachi district of Tokyo City had already appointed four dentists to conduct oral examinations of elementary school children. This can be said to be the earliest start.</p>
<p>By the second year of Taisho, the school oral hygiene movement became more vigorous. The following year, the 26th Newspaper Company opened a popular hygiene exposition at Shinobazu Pond in Ueno, Tokyo. The products related to dental applications were also extremely rich, which aroused public interest. In April of the same year, a school dental treatment center was established in the Third Higher Girls' School of Tokyo Prefecture. This was probably the first dental treatment center in a secondary school in Tokyo City.</p>
<p>In the ninth year of Taisho, the equipment of the treatment center was further improved and greatly renovated. It is still very active today. This is probably the most historical school dental treatment center in Tokyo City.</p>
<p>In April of the sixth year of Taisho, Hiroshima City appointed six dentists from the city authorities to conduct oral examinations of schoolchildren in the city. In June of the seventh year, the Osaka City Dental Association issued special treatment coupons for the purpose of rescuing the poor. In August of the same year, the Lion summer "oral hygiene lecture" gathered about 200 school teachers from all over the country and held the first meeting in Tokyo to promote oral hygiene. Since then, it has been continuing every year. By March of the eighth year, a proposal on "oral hygiene for elementary school children" was submitted to the parliament, and the government committee approved it. In April of the ninth year, the Japan United Dental Association held an oral hygiene lecture to promote it. In October, the Ministry of Internal Affairs opened a children's hygiene exhibition at the Education Museum. Taking this opportunity, they held a "Tooth Prevention Day" to awaken public attention to oral hygiene. In May of the tenth year, people of insight in Tokyo established the Oral Hygiene Research Association. In August, the Hongo District Dental School Doctors Association was established. In September, Mr. Kobayashi opened a Children's Dental Hospital. And other cities such as Chiba, Okayama, and Osaka were also very enthusiastic about the school dental hygiene movement. From this, we can know how much attention was paid to children's oral hygiene at that time.</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of Taisho, the Japan United Dental Association published "Oral Hygiene Materials" in two volumes. (Volume 1 was written by Mr. Endo, and Volume 2 by Mr. Kawakami). Since this year, elementary schools in Tokyo City have been vigorously promoting dental examinations, which has developed greatly. In September of the same year, the Kanto Great Earthquake was encountered. The dental medical group ignored their own safety and organized a dental rescue team to serve the society. In November, Lion Company and Club Company organized a mobile dental clinic team and began to treat children in various elementary schools in the city.</p>
<p>In March of the 14th year of Taisho, Aomori Prefecture took the lead in the country and promulgated regulations for the appointment of school dental doctors by prefectural decree. After that, various prefectures also promulgated regulations. By the fourth year of Showa, two prefectures and twenty-five counties had followed the regulations of the prefectural decree, gradually forming a very organized oral hygiene movement. Each prefecture has a school dental doctor association, and the number of school dental treatment centers is also increasing year by year. Taking Tokyo City as an example, there are about fifty, and nearly two hundred throughout the country. However, there are fewer municipal ones, only a few cities such as Kanazawa, Otaru, Hakodate, and Asahikawa.</p>
<p>Since the third year of Showa, the Japan Dental Medical Association, with the support of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Education, has stipulated that June 4th every year is "Tooth Prevention Day." On this day, the whole country is enthusiastic, taking schools, students, factories, and the army as the center, carrying out extensive publicity. The whole country speaks with one voice and carries out regular oral hygiene movements. Countries around the world are probably not comparable.</p>

<p>Q: What other symptoms are there?</p>
<p>A: Others include mild fever, secondary anemia, abnormal menstruation, and proteinuria.</p>
<p>Q: How long does this osteomalacia last?</p>
<p>A: It usually lasts two to three years to five years, and sometimes ten years. Sometimes the disease stagnates temporarily, but it worsens during pregnancy and childbirth in early spring.</p>
<p>Q: What is the prognosis of this disease, good or bad?</p>
<p>A: If appropriate treatment is not given, death will result from high-grade weakness, cachexia, pneumonia, sepsis, etc.</p>
<p>Q: How to diagnose osteomalacia?</p>
<p>A: In women, attention should be paid to previous pregnancy and childbirth disorders. In men, pay attention to deformities of the chest and spine. If X-rays are used to diagnose bone shadows, it can be more accurate.</p>
<p>Q: What diseases should be differentiated?</p>
<p>A: It should be differentiated from bone cancer, war osteomalacia, and multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>Q: What is the treatment method for osteomalacia?</p>
<p>A: There are dietary therapy, physical therapy, and drug therapy.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Q: What is dietary therapy?</p>
<p>A: Patients should eat fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, cream, eggs, rice, vitamin D, fish liver oil, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What is physical therapy?</p>
<p>A: Patients should breathe fresh air, be exposed to sunlight, and be irradiated with artificial sun lamps. Take water baths every day, especially carbonic acid baths and mineral spring baths.</p>

<h3 id="e193">The Medicine of Pain Relief (14) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Neuralgia</p>
<p>Neuralgia is a type of pain caused by irritation or inflammation of nerve fibers. The most common neuralgia affects the trigeminal nerve in the face, followed by the nerves in the lower posterior part of the head where it connects to the neck, the intercostal nerves, the lower cervical nerves near the neck, and the nerves in the upper thigh joint and the back of the thigh.</p>
<p>Trigeminal Neuralgia The trigeminal nerve is the fifth cranial nerve that originates in the brain. Each of these paired nerves divides into three major branches. The first branch is distributed above the eye and in the forehead, extending to the top of the scalp. If this part of the nerve is stimulated, this area will experience pain. The second branch is distributed in the upper jaw and the front part of the face, next to the nose. If this branch of the nerve is stimulated, this area will experience pain. The third branch is distributed in the lower jaw, chin, and side of the face. If this part of the nerve is stimulated, this area will also experience pain.</p>
<p>There are several causes of trigeminal neuralgia: (1) Tertiary syphilis (not every case of tertiary syphilis causes trigeminal neuralgia). (2) Malaria. (3) Anemia. (4) Chronic poisoning, such as diabetes, gout, lead poisoning, and excessive drinking. (5) Overexertion. (6) Prolonged breastfeeding by women. (7) Nerve irritation, such as from teeth, impacted wisdom teeth, or inflammation in the nasal cavity. In addition to any of the above causes, exposure to cold, sudden changes in atmospheric pressure (such as ascending or descending in altitude), nerve stimulation, excessive fatigue, or slight irritation of the area where the nerve is distributed, such as chewing food, talking, yawning, brushing teeth, or washing the face, can easily trigger the nerve pain, or cause an old pain to recur.</p>
<p>The pain comes in waves and is extremely severe. Patients often describe the pain as stabbing, cutting, tearing, or burning. Each episode involves multiple waves of pain. The duration of the episodes can vary from several minutes to several hours, or even several days. After the pain subsides, the patient returns to normal. The longer this condition lasts, the more frequent and intense the pain episodes become.</p>
<p>The best approach to treating this type of pain is to eliminate the underlying cause. For example, treating late-stage syphilis, curing rhinitis, fixing decayed teeth, or extracting impacted wisdom teeth can often provide a permanent solution.</p>
<p>When the pain occurs, the palliative treatment methods are roughly as follows: Internally administered analgesics such as acetanilide, antipyrine, phenacetin, or similar drugs have comparable value. Note that these medications should not be taken for too long, as their effectiveness gradually diminishes and they can harm the body. Avoid using narcotics, as they are highly addictive. Hydrotherapy can be very beneficial. Additionally, nerve-calming medications can also provide some relief.</p>
<p>Arthralgia</p>
<p>Arthralgia is a complex condition. Some cases involve acute inflammatory pain, while others involve chronic inflammatory pain. Chronic cases often linger for years. Most Chinese people with this condition only know to apply plasters to the painful area, without ever inquiring about the cause of the pain. If we understand the cause of arthralgia, we can see that plasters have limited value and are not the proper course of treatment. I will briefly describe the causes of arthralgia below for readers' reference: The main causes of acute arthritis are: (1) Rheumatism, where bacteria multiply in the endocardium and enter the bloodstream, invading the joints and causing arthritis. (2) Gonorrhea (related to leucorrhea in women), where gonococci invade the joints via the blood. (3) Inflammation caused by pneumococci. (4) Pus formation within the joint. (5) Secondary to acute infectious diseases, such as scarlet fever arthritis, endocarditis arthritis, typhoid arthritis, dysentery arthritis, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e194">Common Knowledge on Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Hygiene <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(47) Acute Otitis Media</p>
<p>Acute otitis media mostly occurs during acute febrile infectious diseases (such as measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid fever, influenza, whooping cough, smallpox, pneumonia, erysipelas, etc.) and acute or chronic inflammation of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, etc. Furthermore, swimming, nasal lavage, intranasal surgery, tympanic membrane injury, etc., can sometimes also cause acute otitis media. The most common bacteria that cause acute otitis media are Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, and Staphylococcus. Sometimes, it is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Diphtheria bacillus, influenza bacillus, typhoid bacillus, and tubercle bacillus, etc. The easiest route of infection is through the Eustachian tube. Clinically, acute otitis media can be divided into two types: acute simple otitis media and acute perforating otitis media. Although these two types have different conditions, their causes are the same. I will now describe their conditions separately as follows:</p>
<p>1. Acute Simple Otitis Media</p>
<p>The main symptom of acute simple otitis media is pain inside the ear. The pain is stabbing and tearing. Mostly intermittent. The ear pain can worsen at night, during coughing, sneezing, swallowing movements, etc. Hearing loss is also a common symptom. At the same time, one often feels fullness in the ear, headache, and pulsating tinnitus. Fever is only more severe in children. Often exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Sometimes vomiting, dizziness, delirium, stupor, and spasms, etc., similar to the symptoms of meningitis, occur. Sometimes facial nerve palsy and taste disorders occur. If we use an otoscope to examine the tympanic membrane, we will see that the tympanic membrane is congested and swollen.</p>
<p>When this disease goes well, the ear pain can be relieved after about two or three days. At the same time, the exudate accumulated in the tympanic cavity will also gradually be absorbed. After about two weeks, the congestion and swelling of the tympanic membrane can subside and return to normal. However, if encountered with improper treatment, weakness, anemia, adenoid disease, tuberculosis, diabetes, and patients with chronic nasopharyngeal disease, the course of the disease will be prolonged. Even turning into acute perforating otitis media, or chronic catarrhal otitis media. Or secondary mastoiditis with pus. Sometimes it can even lead to meningitis, brain abscess, sepsis, etc., leading to fatal results.</p>
<h3 id="e195">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (51) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Complications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Section 1: Tuberculous Meningitis (Continued)</p>
<p>How is tuberculous meningitis formed? First, it is due to the invasion of the vascular system, which has been mentioned in the section on acute miliary tuberculosis! The progression through the lymphatic system is also possible: like tuberculous otitis media, which is a good route. In addition, whether the cervical lymph nodes and tonsils are possible is still undecided. In terms of the time of occurrence, it mostly occurs after the initial aggregation of lesions. It is relatively rare in later complete forms. The fact that adults rarely suffer from this disease can be considered as circumstantial evidence!</p>
<p>In Chapter 9, it was mentioned that acute miliary tuberculosis has a meningitic type, and tubercle bacilli can also be detected in the spinal fluid. Then, readers may ask: Is there any difference between them? Or are they completely the same? This cannot be determined solely based on clinical symptoms. We must know that acute miliary tuberculosis is a systemic disease, hence the name "systemic miliary tuberculosis." Unlike tuberculous meningitis, which is a completely localized disease, only the clinical symptoms may sometimes be more pronounced locally! Secondly, acute miliary tuberculosis is entirely formed by the invasion of the vascular system, while tuberculous meningitis is not necessarily. Thirdly, acute miliary tuberculosis has extremely high temperature; temperature rise in tuberculous meningitis is not very high, close to 40 degrees is rarely seen. These are just examples. As to whether they are one disease with two names, I think readers will definitely understand.</p>
<p>Section 2: Pleurisy</p>
<p>Pleurisy, based on its causes, used to be classified into primary and secondary types. Primary pleurisy arises directly from the body itself. Secondary pleurisy is caused by invasion from nearby areas or by the internal transfer of other infectious lesions. However, according to recent studies, this classification is not very appropriate because most cases of primary pleurisy are associated with tuberculous causes. In fact, it tells us that most people who have had pleurisy once will develop tuberculosis later. In addition, in exudative pleurisy, tubercle bacilli can be found in 50% of the exudate. Even the initial tuberculous lesions and infiltrations can have a close relationship with the pleura. Especially in exudative pleurisy, it accounts for almost 95% of cases with tuberculous causes. Based on these facts, so-called primary pleurisy hardly exists. As for the inseparable relationship between tuberculosis and pleurisy, it is even more obvious.</p>
<p>Why does pleurisy occur so easily in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis? We must know that the visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs. If there is tuberculous infiltration on the lung surface, it can directly invade the pleura. This is the case not only for tuberculosis, but also for pneumonia, pulmonary gangrene, lung abscess, etc. However, it is not as common as in tuberculosis!</p>

<h3 id="e196">League of Nations Discusses Relief for Russian Women in Shanghai <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The League of Nations is not only an international political organization, but also seems to be an international charity. In addition to resolving international disputes, it also does some charitable work. A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 29th: The League of Nations is now paying attention to the problem of Russian émigrés in Shanghai. According to a report from the Committee on the Traffic in Women and Children, among the 10,000 Russian women in Shanghai, those between the ages of 16 and 45 account for 7,200, of which 22.5% rely on prostitution for a living. The League of Nations is now considering establishing special vocational training centers, affordable restaurants, and hostels to accommodate these helpless women.</p>
<p>Since the success of the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the communist state, a group of White Russians, left over from the imperial era, were unwilling to live under the rule of the Red Army leaders due to differences in ideology. They were forced to leave their homeland and wander around the world, living a stateless existence. Especially for women, their situation is even more miserable and pitiful. According to the League of Nations' investigation, there are as many as 10,000 Russian women drifting in Shanghai. These helpless women, living in a foreign land, with no family property and no occupation, their situation is bound to deteriorate day by day. Among them, 22.5% of young or middle-aged women, driven by this dire life, have to sacrifice their bodies and resort to prostitution to make a living. This is indeed very worthy of our sympathy.</p>
<p>But on second thought, weren't some of these White Russian women drifting abroad enjoying a very leisurely life before the overthrow of imperial Russia, enjoying all the happiness in the world? Their tragic plight today may very well be the result of their past extravagance and licentiousness. This is not an overstatement. However, that is the past. We feel that these White Russian women who were abandoned by their homeland and drifting in a foreign land, living a wandering life, are indeed worthy of people's sympathy. Therefore, we believe that it is a very pleasing thing that the League of Nations is now paying attention to these 10,000 helpless Russian women in Shanghai and is trying to find ways to provide relief to alleviate their plight. Its value is no less than solving an international problem.</p>

<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1935, the atmosphere of the drama movement was quite strong, but recently, this drama movement, which was once lively, has become silent again. It was not until now that the John Drama Society broke this silent atmosphere.</p>
<p>The plays performed this time were three in total: "The Thief" (one-act play), "White Girl" (two-act play), and "Freedom" (one-act play); in addition, there were some songs and dances and music from the National Conservatory of Music.</p>
<p>When I went, because it was a little late, the "songs and dances" and the one-act play "The Thief" watched by the Nanyang overseas Chinese had already been performed, so I only saw the two plays "White Girl" and "Freedom". Now, let me write down some of my impressions of these two plays below:</p>
<p>It is said that the script of "White Girl" is the work of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian. It has not been performed in Shanghai before, and it was jointly directed by Mr. Ying Yunwei and Mr. Tang Na.</p>
<p>What does "White Girl" tell us? It says that there are two "clowns" who simultaneously fall in love with the "white girl". So they bet, whoever can't tell who is disguised, whoever wins the "white girl", let the winner "have a happy ending". But what is the result? Although the senior brother wins, he sees that the white girl loves his junior brother more than she loves him, so he ends it all with one stroke.</p>
<p>This is a "comedy", a comedy that makes people laugh, but after laughing, we can't find any more significant meaning. If we must find its meaning, it is probably as written in the instructions, let "people who are going to swirl in a love triangle" learn his "admirable spirit" to avoid "suffering losses". If you want to find meaning beyond that, you really can't find it.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, what is admirable is the earnestness and effort of the staff, the kind of persistent and meticulous spirit. In terms of the actors, although there are exaggerated movements or shortcomings, that is because of the lack of stage experience. We can still see their earnest and hardworking spirit.</p>
<p>The original author of the script "Freedom" is John Reed of the United States. It was translated into Chinese by Mr. Qiu Bo and published in the special issue of the sixth volume of "Modern". But unfortunately, until now, I have not read that script.</p>
<p>The play tells the story of four prisoners who want to break out of prison. Among these four prisoners, one is an ironworker, one is a poet, one is a "romantic"—to be more precise, we might as well say he is a mental patient—and the other is a minor offender with great religious faith.</p>
<p>When these four prisoners are planning to escape from prison, the poet is in high poetic spirits. He plans to immediately write a poem praising freedom. The minor offender, because he is old, perhaps because his crime is minor, or because he is anesthetized by religion, does not plan to escape halfway. And that neurotic so-called "romantic," when he discovers that the file and rope ladder made with three years of effort are useless, he also does not escape because it is too easy. As a result, only the worker who yearns for freedom wants to escape, but he is immediately held back by the three "gentlemen," because his escape will harm them?</p>
<p>According to the author's original intention, perhaps it is to satirize the gentlemen. He knows that "it is the worker who roars, and it is only the worker who wants to go out." However, using the prison as a background and writing these four different characters together, it is inevitable to make people feel a sense of fantasy. You think, an action that has been going on for three years, wouldn't you understand the opponent's character beforehand? How can there be a sudden change when the opportunity comes?</p>
<p>In terms of the development of the plot, it also makes people feel that it is too "ideal".</p>
<p>I don't know what the prisons in the United States are like, but after watching "The Fugitive" some time ago, my impression seems to be that it is not much different from China. In this way, I have several questions in this play: (1) In today's prisons, there seem to be no more kerosene lamps and tap lights, especially tap lights. It is said that they are prohibited to prevent prisoners from committing suicide. Although this is supposed to be a light prison cell. (2) Where did the prisoner's pistol come from? (3) Why is that iron-grille window suddenly unlatched? Since you don't need a rope ladder to grab the wall, and there are no sentries, are you really not afraid of the prisoners escaping?</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the author's original intention is not bad, in the development of the plot and things, it is ultimately too "ideal".</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the spirit of hard work and earnestness is worthy of our admiration, but because the progress of the play is too flat and the climax has no power, it cannot grasp the audience's emotions.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Taste of Life <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>He was also stirred by the strangeness to generate inexplicable anger. Since that was the case, he was himself, and his uncle was his uncle. What else was there to say? So he suddenly gathered great courage, opened his eyes, looked at his uncle, and said angrily:</p>
<p>"Whatever, consider it over like this. I will never set foot in your threshold again."</p>
<p>Saying this, he gritted his teeth and rushed out of the door.</p>
<p>On the way, the coffin containing his father's shell might not even have been painted with black ink, but the surrounding environment had rapidly collapsed, and even his uncle, who was so close like family, had become a stranger.</p>
<p>Whenever he thought of this, recalled the situation when he ran to his uncle's house that day, his uncle's iron-faced, gloomy face would suddenly appear in his mind's eye, and the fire of anger would immediately pierce through his brain, and his teeth would grind with a rustling sound. He shook his fist as if he wanted to grab someone.</p>
<p>Then he would say to himself: Hmph, just look down on me. Don't be so smug. Even if I'm so poor that I have to beg for food, I will never ask for your help. Just wait and see, someday.</p>
<p>Then he would mutter to himself like a neurological error.</p>
<p>So his mother would quietly stand in front of him, encouraging and comforting her son:</p>
<p>—There's no need to get angry about these things. People are always like this. It's okay not to rely on others. Just do your own thing and show people what you're capable of.</p>
<p>What his mother said was exactly what he was thinking.</p>
<p>But he always wanted to remember all the glorious scenes of his family in earlier days: At that time, whether it was night or day, guests would come and go like a stream from early in the morning? Every guest had different but the same expectations for the host, so every face was smiling and unusually kind, babbling about this and that. The mouths were unusually sweet and smooth. If they happened to meet the father not at home, or not up yet, he, the young master, would take the place of his father to greet the guests, and all the guests would chat and laugh with him with the same strong interest. The whole house would be constantly noisy with laughter from morning to night, but where have the guests and laughter gone now?</p>
<p>They disappeared at the same time as his father.</p>
<p>The two door knockers that had been heavily and lightly knocked by many people's hands, now can't hear the slightest sound, and are so idle that they almost start to rust. The guests have suddenly become so lonely, letting the boundless emptiness lock them up, as cold and quiet as an ancient temple. Except for himself occasionally coming back from outside, there have been one or two sporadic knocks on the door, otherwise, there is no movement at all.</p>
<p>People have all gone far away from him, including his uncle.</p>
<p>Passing in front of that guest's door, and knowing the past of this family, you will deeply evoke a kind of distant memory and sigh:</p>
<p>"Now it's too lonely!"</p>
<h3 id="e199">Small Pieces of Apartment Life <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Yin</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Like a fledgling bird without a nest, flying out of the old nest of freedom, the power of life is constantly and everywhere forcing me into a state of dilapidation and hardship. On a day when the snow melted not far behind the order of the seasons, the storm of life broke my dreams again; so I picked up a small travel bag and a heart full of worldly dust, and the night's speeding train took me to this corner of the building—relying on the warmth of friends, and now it is the season of falling flowers again.</p>
<p>The atmosphere overflowing around here is always so peaceful and quiet, like a blue pool in autumn, proud of the peace of its own life in a satisfied smile. Every morning, a cockcrow awakens the faint dream, facing the light and shadow of the morning sun, the sky is a clear blue, all the fields and vegetables are green, the smoke from the kitchen is faint in the willow forest, with the laughter of birds, and the roses on the bamboo fence are just beginning to bloom. At this time, I usually sit facing the window, squeezing a little bit of the source of life from the tip of the white gold pen. When I am tired of writing, I drink a glass of plain water, and look up at the morning sun, which has risen into the air majestically at some unknown time. I will leisurely yearn for it, celebrating the greatness and arrival of the light, and the reflection makes me feel heartbroken about the terrible state of depression. I will throw away the fountain pen, get up suddenly, and stretch out my arms to shout at the rising sun.</p>
<p>"I want a bright and vigorous future!"</p>
<p>Yes, this apartment life has become so quiet that it has become a state of depression. Living like this, for one's young life, is simply an incurable waste. One must be like the eagle described by Gorky in The Song of the Falcon, yearning for the light, fighting for the light to the point of death. This is ultimately a praiseworthy warrior's behavior.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>It is the season of falling flowers again.</p>
<p>The passage of time cannot help but make people regret the passing of youth.</p>
<p>—Flowers fall and water flows, red, a thousand kinds of idle sorrows. Although these sentimental sentences of ancient poets and lyricists will not slip from my own pen, when the roses on the trellis are removed, and the purple petals are one by one, it also makes me feel that such a young force is dormant in a corner of the building, and another spring has silently disappeared. The hidden pain and anxiety in the center are enough for a sleepless night.</p>
<p>—What are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Although the cuckoo can't stop the spring that is about to return, spring will come again next year; but the gone years will never come back!</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the plum rain season will be even more dull and suffocating. After this, it will be the scorching summer.</p>

<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Life is a stone, heavy with a thousand pounds weighing on your shoulders; life is also a rugged narrow road, stretching endlessly under your feet, unless you swallow your last breath and fall, this endless narrow road will never be finished. Originally, a person's life is so fragile, it is not difficult to cut off a breath in a snap with a convenient and tragic method. However, God's bestowal of intelligence to mankind is very stingy; foolishness ultimately weaves the brains of most people, and although the current life is heavy and difficult, one cannot easily fall: even at the last moment when the vigor of life is exhausted to the point of inevitable collapse, there is still a final struggle of fading glory, filled with helpless resentment and lingering affection for the world. This is the extreme peak of human sorrow, and also the strong endowment of human beings' desire for life.</p>
<p>If this statement is the explanation of life, then Hou Awang is a pitiful person who uses this foolish brain to bear a heavy and difficult life.</p>
<p>Hou Awang is no different from ordinary people, he needs to eat and wear clothes; it's just that he was born a bit short, and it seems because of this shortness, he can only be a petty tailor in his life. His father was originally a farmer, but because he didn't want his son to endure this hard life, he sent him to a tailor shop in the city as an apprentice when his son was twelve years old. The father had great hopes for his son. From apprentice to master, from master to boss, after that he could put down the hoe, hold his dry tobacco pipe and enjoy life in the shop. Unfortunately, the year his son finished his apprenticeship, his old man passed away with regret, leaving Hou Awang to become a helpless outcast.</p>
<p>At that time, Awang had just turned twenty. Although eight years of apprenticeship had worn away his youthful vigor, he always showed a shy and humble appearance in front of people, but beautiful dreams of the future were still woven in his heart, constantly encouraging him and guiding him, so that he could still believe that his youth could easily create a good future; he understood that the Hou family's ancestral line had to rely entirely on him to continue, so, in the pile of needles and threads, he buried his head, silently anticipating the unfolding of the future, crawling like a snail on the line of life.</p>
<p>Endless years passed like lightning, wrinkles had ruthlessly smeared the corners of his eyes and forehead, a pair of reading glasses was perched on the bridge of his nose, and two meager whiskers grew on his mouth, the disillusionment of hope made him more silent, humble, and awkward, he was already a forty-five-year-old man. However, it was also in the spring of that year, perhaps his peach blossom luck had arrived, that after three nights of hesitation, he unconditionally adopted a pregnant woman who was both mute and had a kicking leg, the light of hope flickered in his heart again, he seemed to become more alive, he had a wife.</p>
<p>Half a year passed, and this mute wife did indeed give him a monkey-like little thing. At that time, he could truly taste the joy of life, and that day he devoutly kowtowed nine times in the ancestral hall, and tears flowed down uncontrollably.</p>
<p>However, his physical strength was ultimately insufficient, his old-fashioned tailoring was no longer appreciated, and people gradually forgot about him. Because he couldn't find work, the burden on his shoulders became heavier than before, besides his own mouth, there were two more hungry bellies to feed, and he suddenly fell into a mud pit.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the news of "Hou Awang stealing sweet potatoes" spread throughout the village one night, people would never forget to snort behind his back, mocking him.</p>
<p>——He doesn't even have the ability to support himself, yet he wants to support a wife and have a son? Hmph, he'd be better off dying early, why live and suffer?</p>
