<h3>保護兒童與殘忍心之去除　恒</h3>
<p>丨因慈幼會請求制裁凌虐兒童有感丨</p>
<p>近來婦女凌虐兒童之事。報章時有所見。如本市舞女張愛珍之虐待六齡幼養女張小寳。與天津小姐陳湘君之虐待七齡婢女蓮喜。其最著者。此二幼女皆非張陳二人所出。凌虐玩弄供快私。意固不足異。最駭人聽聞者。卽不久以。前報章曾載某姓婦。人迷信其親生兒子。命中與己有所冲尅。竟生將其斬屍數段。棄之荒地。然此種不近人情之事。僅就其被人發覺者而言。其未被人發覺者。事實上當亦不少也。蓋虐婢之事舊社會。中殊爲習見而殺嬰之事於荒年饑饉之時所見尤多。其死於父母之迷信者。亦間有所聞故此種非人道之殘酷行爲見於報章者雖不多然其問題之嚴。重實不容我人輕易視之也據昨報所。載慈幼會對於以立法方法保護婢女一。事曾費相當努力最近新刑律之改。正亦甚着重於兒童保護之一點。可知社會對於此等問題已有相當之注意歐美各國。對於動物猶爲立法保護不容橫施虐待。矧於同類之人。而可任其嘗受慘酷之待。遇殘害其身心之發展哉。故慈幼會之努力。與立法當局之有見於此皆爲値得我人贊美之行動。</p>
<p>然以立法方法保護兒童。此僅治標之方法。欲求根本治療。似須更作進一步之行動。蓋虐待幼童之事爲殘忍心之表現。而殘忍心之表現。隨處可施。固不必觸犯刑律。而後始能加害於兒童也。故此處所需者。乃爲殘忍心之去除。至於殺嬰之事屬於天災之結果者。法律之力。更無所施可不具論其受迷信之害者。根治之法自在普及敎育之一途。亦無煩贅言。惟此殘忍心之去除。其道果何由耶。曰此在探究殘忍心所以形成之根源耳。</p>
<p>輓近以來。心理之學者。對於人類種種變態心理頗多闡明。其最著者爲奥國之佛洛特DSigmundFrdud阿特勒AltredAdler及瑞士之楊格CarlJung據佛洛特之所見以爲心理失常多由於性慾之受抑唯楊格以爲心理變態。不限性慾之受抑。其他一切慾望之受抑。皆足使人之性。格流於自私殘忍。今就張愛珍與陳湘君之實例而觀。此二人對於婢女之殘忍。似非性慾之不滿足所。致蓋此二人。皆屬舞女。故佛洛特之說。似乎不能適用。而楊格之。說亦語焉不詳。其最能解釋此二人之心理者就記。者觀之。莫過於阿特勒之說。阿氏以爲殘忍。偏狹。嫉忌。兇暴。猖狂。愛好破壞。幸災樂禍。等等心理。實出於自卑之感覺。而自卑之感覺。實以其所處之地位。與人相形見拙。不爲人所重視。因而自怨自艾。思所以取償之道。於是殘忍等等怪僻行。爲隨之而起。矣阿氏更謂此種心理所以婦人多於男子者。卽在今日社會地位。男子猶優於女子之故。。。英美心理學者之接踵而起者。所見亦多相同。皆謂凡人之種種慾望。久遭窒礙。鬱積積於中。必致精神失常而流於怪。僻明乎此。則張陳二人所以虐待婢女之原因。可以恍然卽二人之身世境遇。亦必不甚如意也。</p>
<p>原因旣明。則應付之道。自以去因爲。要蓋法律之爲。用有時而窮。且僅能施之已然。未能防之於未然。故可視爲治禁標之方法。而不能言治本也。就前述各心理學者之理論而觀。治本之。道似在求達人生慾望之滿足。而後能使變態者復其常態。然世間事物。自有限制。烏能盡人而得其滿足哉。故阿特勒氏。以爲莫如以敎育方法。培養愛他愛羣之心。理此種方法。自有相當價。値然欲求得速效恐亦甚難。蓋理智思想之支配人生。其力每不如信仰情感之大。故吾人以爲於此等地方。應有一種合於現代生活宗敎式之感化力。爲之調。劑然後自我之觀念可以稍去。愛他愛羣之心理可以增强。無謂之慾望。可以稍戢。如此則此等殘酷之事。及一切性情怪僻作奸犯科之行爲。。當可日就减少。而較之不敎而刑。者收效更宏矣。</p>

<h3>哈爾哈廟日蒙衝突（哈爾濱通信）</h3>
<p>三角地帶爲軍事要地</p>
<p>日蒙兩方已早有準備</p>
<p>不過此次或能和平了結</p>
<p>貝爾湖邊、東南角上有哈爾哈河流入、貫串呼倫湖與貝爾湖之間有烏爾順河、聯貫以上兩河流的還有一條小江、呌作查理茲河、界乎三條河流與貝爾湖之間的三角地帶、卽是哈爾哈廟所屬地域、這塊地自九一八事變以後、日本就非常注意、認爲不但是［滿］蒙間的要塞、並且在日蘇軍事關係上、有很重大的意義、所以在甘珠寺駐有經日本人所訓練的蒙古兵、這次哈爾哈爾廟事件的發生、是在一月中旬、日本軍事敎官本多少佐、率領士兵十餘名、與外蒙斥候隊相遇、衝突結果、日軍死傷數名、到一月三十、日方纔由海拉爾派一大隊兵去、奪取了哈爾哈廟、據日方的傳說、及僞方的宣傳、說哈爾哈廟應屬於［滿國］、习决不是外蒙地臷域、蒙軍不應强行入境、祇要把蒙軍趕出境外、他們不再向前進了、</p>
<p>但是庫方百傳來消息、如外蒙内閣總理兼外長軍丹所發表的聲明、又說、［哈爾哈廟及其附近一帶地域、自太古以來、卽屬於蒙古領地、從未經呼倫貝爾管轄、因此外蒙古共和國、决不能同意日［滿、軍隊之占領哈爾哈廟、並認定日［滿］兩軍侵犯國境之非法、一月二十四日哈爾哈廟事件以後、數日之間、平穩無事、及至一月三十一日、午前八時、貝爾湖附近國境、警備隊發現日［滿］軍之一部、以軍用汽車數輛、兵騎五十作梯隊陣形、自［滿］境圖越外蒙國境、該部隊旣占領科爾鄂博、復向蒙古境域前進、然外蒙國境警備軍、不願以兵戎相見、故略示後退、示以冷靜態度、爲避免衝突起見、並未開放一槍一砲、現僅在諾林湖畔構築防禦陣地、外蒙政府爲自國權益及恢復和平起見、已禁令國境警備隊、不得私擅開槍、將來並不惜和平交涉也］云云、</p>
<p>據上述聲明看、好像這件事情還不至於怎樣擴大、不過駐在中東沿綫的日軍、都是京都·名古屋·和廣島·等處開來的精銳部隊、其實數多少、雖不能確知、但據軍事家的觀測、以爲至少有兩個半師團、人數總在三萬以上、則是牽一髮而動全身、是很可能的、何况那一般青年軍官、個個都想一試身手、和赤軍見個高下、對方於這樣情形、也相當明瞭、自然不肯放鬆一步、在遠東方面新調集了五個師團的兵力、其主要部隊、都集結在［滿洲］西部國境綫一帶、</p>
<p>外蒙兵力、在庫倫有騎·砲·機關槍混合編成的隊伍、約計二萬人、大砲十門、高射砲八座、爆炸飛機二十一架、偵察機二十五架、此外在庫倫地方、還設立得有陸軍大學·士字學校·及科學兵器廠、那樣廣渶漠萬里的平原、有如此防禦力、恐怕外力是不易侵　進去罷、</p>
<p>克魯倫河左岸·車臣汗屬地、建築行有一所大飛機塲、那所飛機塲裏、藏着三十多架爆炸機、漢亨特地方、還駐紮着五百名騎兵·砲兵一隊·機關槍兵一隊·坦克車六架·軍用汽車若干、哈爾哈廟以西、烏爾順河上流、時常有騎兵斥候兵在那裏往來梭巡、並且有汽車不時飛馳、擔任特務聯絡、在貝爾湖西南的伊瓦布爾分廟、還駐有步兵一團、和騎兵一旅、防備可謂相當週密、所以日本軍、縱然有幾分醉翁之意、想乘機突進、但也不敢眞正去硬拚這早有凖備的外蒙、大約會乘外蒙和平的聲明、而收風轉舵、卽與交涉、也未可知、（二月一日）</p>
<h3>日人在汕佔築碼頭</h3>
<p>爲艦隊及運私貨之根據地</p>
<p>地盤竟伸入海中達十餘丈</p>
<p>汕頭通信、日本海軍、每年分四季輪流出巡我國南部各海岸、其艦隊從台灣馬公要港出帆、直駛上海·温州·福州·厦門·汕頭·香港、或深入廣州、間亦一到瓊崖、凡我國南部沿岸之一島·一山·一港·一石、其深淺度數、潮汐之時間與力量、無不洞悉無遺、其行駛華南商船之噸數、幾駕乎英哪威兩國商輪之上、日盤抵汕、歷來灣泊於崎碌海面、卽日本領事署前之沈趙路尾也、日本領事署、爲在汕各國領事館中最宏偉之建築物、内有警警署及監獄、該署地點、適居市之中央、在東區公署之前約三百步、且與東區公署遙遙相對、至日艦之泊崎碌、無虚一日、係互相瓜代之戌防性質、官兵人員登岸、係用小汽船或舢舨、儎到領署附近之沈趙路尾田野間起陸、一切秘密運輸之行動、均在此間、附近有台灣人開設之大東冰廠、佔地甚廣、日台人多集中此間、再前則爲東瀛學校·博愛醫院·日本人小學校、各佔地數畝、可作集會及駐軍之用、尤其在市府對面之日本小學校、築行異常堅固、儼如軍營、屋角上有瞭望臺種種的設備、可與艦上互通旂語及燈號、日僑散居崎碌一帶者、近年來驟增、不下四五百名、但從無七實之調查、因彼輩所營之事業、多屬於流動性質、</p>
<p>去年日本駐華南各領事官、被日本外務省召往台灣開一個對岸會議、發展汕頭、日本商務、亦爲該會議中重要問題之一、日貨欲在潮汕傾銷、早思在沿岸適中地點築一碼頭、以便商船及兵艦之灣泊、起運沉重之器械與貨物、因以前汕頭海面駁艇工友、一致團結、不肯爲日輪客貨起落、前年淞滬戰罷、日僑勢燄更張、而海面挿太有陽旂之小汽船及駁艇、乃得自由行動、工友團結局勢、無形解體、日貨由是暢入潮汕市面、而銷行於各縣、初由台灣人包運、最近與稅捐局所稽查、發生衝突多次、如海味一項、照章除納海關止税之外、仍須納海味京菒捐、但台灣人則不肯納、致演出毆打稽查查警長之事件、疉有所聞、而此間當局則抱定息事寗人爲宗旨、各案皆遷就了事、寗不可歎、日僑在汕之氣勢旣如此、所以其迫切需要之碼頭、遂於此時建築矣、</p>
<p>商業街口之海坦、原爲商業商業學校與福音醫院所有、業權固確定無疑、詎五年前、有日籍人羅炳章者、突與商業學校發生管業爭執、此案迄今、仍未了結、聞羅某係奉日人意旨、爲欲圖築碼頭之發動也、今日人又在沈趙路佔地建築碼頭、伸出海坦十餘丈以外、且由大東冰廠出面建築、事前並未向市府報告、顯海有意侵我領土主權、且違背市府定章、公安局據岡警報告、已向日方提出交涉矣、</p>
<p>查日人在汕之行動、近已引起當局之極大注意、如日人前在育善街組設一太陽跳舞臺、吸引意志薄弱份子、以便窺探市内各機關之秘密、又組東敎社、以所謂親善之語氣、招致下層階級之苦力·挑夫·艇夫·商店·小販人員、每人每月納少數會費、凡加入者、可藉外勢濫用權威、與稅吏稽查抵抗、并避免稅捐、其初頗風行一時、後因當局之注意防範、彼輩乃用别開生面方法、秘密活動、其最顯著者、爲沿海之走私電輪、去年潮海關、已迭經緝獲、但該電輪竟不顧一切、反連同關兵、儎往台灣商雄、我方提出交涉、迄無效果、次則爲私運貨特、不納稅餉、包辦運入内地之潮揭各縣行銷、設立貨棧、倘稽查將貨物留難、彼輩卽組毆打團以對付之、以前救國會在烏橋河面、截獲運儎海味魚翅之小艇、連人並貨拘入救國會、此毆打團竟從烏橋某工廠、集合出動、持武器手槍、大鬧救國會、將貨及人奪去、此等重大案件、亦不了了之、故毆打團之勢力日漲、稽查稅吏、竟非其對手、以是私運貨物日多、同時潮汕稅捐、十分奇重、正當商民、無法與私貨競銷、遂造成浪人走私之機會、又其私貨、多於夜間運至沈趙路尾大東冰廠中躉存、稽查均無過問、此又爲覇築碼頭之一原因也、（七日）</p>
<h3>津市商業凋敝</h3>
<p>銀錢業倒閉最多</p>
<p>天津通信、津市商業、由去春以來、卽呈畸形發達、租界與非租界各商店營業狀况、相差不可道里計、各大百貨店、非遷入租界、卽縮小範圍、另於租界内設立分號、從前最繁盛之東馬路·北大關·侯家后·除少數六七等以下商店外、二三等商號殆無一家存在、侯家后估衣街、爲大商店之集中區、去年春後、景象冷落、各商號門可羅雀、終日幾無顧客、其有二百餘年歷史之商店、向以批發莊支撑門面者、亦以外縣鎭經濟奇窘、商業凋敝、直接受不景氣影響、竹竿巷爲棉紗業總彙區、亦以受租界内各棉紗莊影響、呈不克支持之狀、由金鋼橋以北、大經路迄新車站、街道長凡五里、無一較大商店、蓋資本稍厚者、皆遷入租界以内、各商店在舊年内外、莫不大標减價傾銷、或逕書［年關削本拍賣字據］、卽藥店亦以九扣八扣相號招、但其吸引顧客效力仍甚微、故各商店倒閉歇業者累累、其中尤以銀錢業、以放欵不能如時收回、拖累甚多、倒閉者更夥、租界内商號、表面似乎繁榮、其實以捐稅過重、往往入不敷出、各商號不得不抱薄利主義、祇要不賠本、卽向外賣、故各商店雖然門庭如市、顧客擁擠、推其實際、亦悉外强中乾、苦况正不下於租界外者、在津市英法義日四租界中、比較瀪榮者爲法租界之梨棧、及二十六號路、日租界之旭街、但日租界因屢次發生變亂、且華北局勢不穩、稍有身份者、咸存戒心、裹足不前、商號遂亦受其影響、法租界梨棧各商店、都在汉日交界處、乃蔚爲全津沽商業中心、據社會局調查、租界以外十四等營業捐以上商號、前年約三萬二千餘家、去歲一年内倒閉者踵相接、現所餘不過二萬一千餘家、租界内商店統計亦在二萬家以上、去年雖續有增加、大多係由華街移往者、新開者則無多、目下廢歷年關總結賬期雖過、但尙不得視爲無何變化、恐行元宵節過後、租界内外尙有商店歇業也、（七日）</p>

<h3>社會建設中婚喪禮節問題</h3>
<p>丨吳市長大市府紀念週報告丨</p>
<p>現今禮節凌亂無序漫無標準</p>
<p>應加糾正使社會均有所適從</p>
<p>中央社云、上海市政府、於昨晨在市府大禮堂、舉行總理紀念週、到市府秘書處·及所屬各局職員·數面人、由市長吳鐵城領導行禮、並報告［社會建設中之婚喪禮節問題、］其原詞如下、</p>
<p>各位同志、上次聯合紀念週、我曾對於本市今年的施政方針、作了一個綜合的報告、并且說明、今年爲本市的社會建設年、希望全體同人、在今年民國二十四年内、本着社會建設的方針、努力從事於社會事業的建設、但是社會事業、需要建設者很多、我們時間·財力·人力·各方面都不許可我們在一二年或三四所内、可以完全辦竣、况且社會事業、是没有一天辦得完的、因爲社會是天天在進步着、我們自然也應當日新又新、自强不息的、跟着時代而邁進、所以現在我們祇能於我們時間財力人力所許可的範圍内、先擇定幾件目前最急要的社會事業、在今年内來做、但是除了我們上次所規定的幾件社會事業以外、另外還有一件有關社會風紀的事、要喚起我們市政府全體同人的注意與研究、同時也要喚起上海全市市民的注意與研究的、就是婚喪喜慶的事情、</p>
<p>這是我們任何人都認爲是一件終身很大很重要的事、但是現在社會上所流行的婚喪喜慶的禮節、大都是等於兒戲、簡直没有禮節可言、我國從前關於冠婚喪祭、都有一定的禮節、而且無論什麽人、都是一體尊重、這種舊禮節、固然是很繁琑、且不合近時代的精神、可是廢除了舊禮節以後、我們現在還没有新禮節定出來、現在社會上所流行的、都是不中不西、不古不今、一個人有一個人的樣子、今天與明天不同、明天又與後天不同、使社會幾幾乎成爲一個没有規則的社會、大家各自爲政、如此凌亂無序的社會、我們還有什麽方法來團結他呢、</p>
<p>我們知道、一個健全社會的生活、第一要能够團結、有紀律、要社會能團結、有紀律、就要使這個社會有一個共同的風俗習慣、使生存在全社會裏的各個份子、大家有一個共同遵守的標準、然後這個社會才能够團結、有紀律、這個社會的基礎、也才能穏固、可是我們中國現在的社會、却是一個不中不西、不今不古的社會、没有一定的禮節、使我們大家都無所適從、并且到處發生予盾的現象、我們看現在上海街上出喪的儀仗、有許多地方、眞與喜事一樣、而且儀仗、本來是用以表示莊嚴的、却由一般極不像樣的人充之、精神姿態、固都不整、穿的服裝、尤是無奇不有、軍樂隊所奏的音樂、往往喪事奏喜樂、喜事奏喪樂、十足的表現出我們社會的没有規則、與没有禮節、還有一回某化裝品公司舉行新廠落成典禮、請我去參加、那時的音樂隊、不應奏國樂的時候、忽然奏起國樂來、觀衆因此一齊站起來、而奏樂的人、却是坐着不立起來、且吹奏不齊、有二人、在奏至一半的時候、才跟着奏、諸如此類的事情、我們眞是舉不勝與、總之、無處不表現着社會的凌亂而已、還有關於婚禮、也是没有一定的規例、即如所謂文明結緍婚、也有幾點不妥、一是新郎新娘交換戒指、不親自交換、而是由男女儐相代表交換、二是結婚證書上蓋章、也不親自蓋章、而由男女儐相代表、三婚禮時的講演、大都是視同兒戲、甚至作許多穢褻之詞、毫不鄭重、因此凡有人請我證婚的時候、我必須要約法三章、第一、新郎新娘必須親自交換指戒、第二、必須親自蓋章、第三、還不許任何人在舉行婚禮的時候講笑話、作穢褻之詞、致失婚禮的莊嚴性、</p>
<p>婚禮喪禮、這是社會上兩件極大的事情、而這兩件社會上極大的事情、都表現出我們中國社會的没有規則、没有禮節、没有組織、祇是亂七八糟、如此情形、我們還有什麽方法、可以使社會團結、使社會興奮使社會動起來呢、制禮作樂、固然是中央的職權、但是現在社會上這樣漫無禮節、甚至謬絶倫的情形、我們也不能讓他長此遷延下去、所以我們也應該注意、加以糾正、日前我已命令社會局、取締營業軍樂隊的奇裝異服、並令他們喜事奏喜樂、喪事奏樂、須有一定的規則、同時又令公安局取締出喪儀仗、但是這樣消極的禁止、尙不足以收效、故此須定出一個一定的標準、使社會大家都有所適從、以期現在這種漫無標準凌亂無序的情形、不再出現於未來的上海社會、這也是市政府全體同人在今年民國二十四年努力於社會建設事業時、所應注意和努力的一件事、其次大家還要記着、新生活運動的週年、轉瞬即屈、我們尤應努力、從社會一般禮俗的改良上、來實現新生活運動的理想、</p>

<h3>觸礁經過</h3>
<p>此次民康於上月由滬載貨　　上駛、抵宜後、以川北剿匪軍事關係、故於本月五日、奉差遣由宜昌空船駛漢應差、詎八日午刻十二時、該輪駛抵距漢口三十里之沌口地方、因水淺流急、誤觸礁石、船腹受受創極鉅、隨卽下沉、當時船員預備搶救、已不及、船主急發求救信號、幸頼附近小輪、聞警馳往援救、且該輪除船員外、並未搭客載貨、故未有生命危險、現船已全部沉没、船員全體遇救、暫住漢口分公司、以待善後、</p>
<h3>損失一斑</h3>
<p>該輪雖已觸礁沉没、惟係空船、未裝物貨、當徐徐下駛時、所有船員行裝、亦駁上小輪、故損失祇船身與傢具耳失約十餘萬元、但船身曾向外商保有平安水險、預期不至有若何重大損失、於打撈與否、須由重慶總公司派員勘測後决定、關於出事詳情、因航空郵件誤班、上海分公司尙未接得函告、</p>
<p>又據另一消息該輪曾向北美洲保險行保險七萬元、現任船主爲袁長發云、</p>

<h3>對日的兩條綫（二續）林柏生</h3>
<p>·····讀徐道鄰［中日關係的檢討］書後···</p>
<p>末了，附帶說幾句。</p>
<p>徐文中有一段說話，述及二十一年一月間，蔣介石氏所發表的意見書，其對日外交的主張是［不絶交，不宣戰，不講和，不訂約］十二個字，徐君以爲雖然［並不是澈底的，］但［不能不說這個政策比較是無法之法，因爲國力兵力絶不相等的國家，只可用這個政策和戰略與之相周旋。［我以爲九一八以後汪精衛氏所提出［一面交涉一面抵抗［八個字，也正是這個意恩。當時他因爲見東北駐軍不抵抗，所以主張一面抵抗，因爲見舉國主張不交涉，所以主張一面交涉。兩乾相較，没有不同，所不同的，［不絶交，不宜戰，不講和，不訂約，］是從消極方面確定外交軍事方針的範圍，［一面交涉，一而抵抗［是從積極方面指出外交軍事方針的動向。爲什麽說是無辦法中的辦法？因爲這樣做法，誰都不敢說有什麽把握，可是，事實上，却不能不這樣的艱苦去做。</p>
<p>一二八以後，在政治負責當局與軍事負責當局汪莊兩氏領導之下，中國所走的完全是這一條路綫。</p>
<p>交涉與抵抗的意義，上面已經說過。所謂交涉，便是在極端忍讓之下，求得解决，所謂抵抗便是到了忍無可忍讓無可讓的時候，爲領土主權人民生命財產計，不能不奮起而爲正當的防衛。淞滬戰爭的時候，日本以武力相加，已至忍無可忍讓無可讓的境地了，所以盡力抵抗，抵抗失敗，便負責交涉，簽訂淞滬恊定，這是交涉與抵抗的經過。華北戰爭的時候，日本又以武力相加；也已至忍無可忍讓無可讓的境地了；所以盡力抵抗，抵抗失敗，又負責交涉，簽訂塘沽恊定，這也是交涉與抵抗的經過。至於訴請國聯，國聯調查團的來華，李頓報告書的製成，國聯的議决案認日晒爲侵略者，認僞組織爲傀儡，給予中國以一個公道的同情，也都是交涉的經過。自然，昔以不抵抗而失地，今以抵抗而失地，横豎要交涉，似乎當初不必抵抗，旣抵抗了，似乎後來不應交涉。事後來看，我們不能說這樣做法是澈底的，但一念及當日的情形，却不能不說這樣做法，是實逼處此的。以現有的國力，抵抗之必不能得到勝利，誰不知道，知之而猶抵抗，正是爲國家爭人格，爲民族求生存之堅决表示，成敗利鈍，非其斯計。　知道，抵抗與交涉，似乎相反，實則相成，有抵抗，然後有交涉，抵抗愈得力，交涉愈有希望，至於抵抗之後，内無後繼，外　　異援，總而交涉，誰也知道是出於不得已的。去年一月二十三日汪氏在中央執行委員會第四屈第四次全體會議作政治報告，曾做過一個譬喻，他說，一個村鄕，三更半夜，遇着土匪，攻入大門，第一着應該怎樣呢？自然是牢守二門，第二着便是鳴鑼求救，及至鑼聲響了，救兵不至，而大門已失，看看的連二門也保守不住了。那時候又應該怎樣呢？爲保守二門計，办能一面停了鑼聲，一面籌劃如何充實二門以内的防衛，如何緩和二門以餐的攻打了。自淞滬恊定以至塘沽恊定。其情形具如此，直到今日，中國所處的情形，也還是如此。</p>
<p>由此可見三年以來中國所走的正是我上面所說的第二條路綫。</p>
<p>三年之間，中國國脈，經了無數的危難，全國人民，受了無數的犧牲，府當局，嘗了無數的鞎艱辛，纔有今日。</p>
<p>今日以後中國還是守着三年以來終始不渝的汪蔣路綫呢？還是别有途徑呢？</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>冩到這裏，剛剛接到美聯社和路透社的東京電訊，大意是說，一月二十九日大阪每日新聞，載有該報政治特派員所著之長文，述日本對華政策之根本原則，預料日政府將以此項原則爲根據，希望中國放棄共舊日傳統的遠近攻交政策，並謂中外務省將注意下列要點，以定其對華新政策，即</p>
<p>（一）維持中國土地之完整，希望第一步爲勦滅共匪，掃盡一切排外運動。</p>
<p>（二）正式談判，以恢復中日兩國間常軌之關係。</p>
<p>（三）日政府對於中國内政仍將不加干涉，對於中國黨爭，亦守中立，但如中國有一個人願意血且力能擔負統治中國的完全責任者，則日本準備擴張對渠給予政治軍事經濟及其他助力。</p>
<p>（四）日本願與中國交換大使，並照日［滿］議定書締結中日恊約，惟中國須覺悟中日唇齒相依，並承認其所居地位，在遠東和平中實甚重要，而勿專以依賴歐美爲務。（五）日本關係遠東政治問題，願與中日另訂恊約，蓋日本不復承認多邊公約如九國公約之類容許第三方面參加者之原則也，（六）關於遠東軍事問題，日本願中國允諾勿再請援於國聯，即退出國聯，亦無不可，並以日本顧問氏歐美顧問。</p>
<p>（七）日本以爲組織中［滿］日集團，實屬至要之舉　，日本於此準備以擴大之財政助力給予中國。</p>
<p>（八）中國對於上述各節，如能表示其誠意，則日本準備將華北休戰恊定改爲永久條約，並在中國與［滿洲國］間設，中立區域（九）日本以爲關於可能的中日雙方條約，應在三月二十七日後六個月開始　當之談判，蓋日本退出國聯，將於是日發生效力也。</p>
<p>就這一段紀　與最近廣田外相在日本議會的演說比對來看，則日本所謂改變對華政策，其意義如何，不難窺見。　　得　對日本人補充說幾句話之必要。</p>
<p>日本果有放棄軍事侵略，更着申日局面，恢復外交常軌的誠意，這於日本自身，於東亞和平，以至於世界和平，都是有百利而無一弊的。我以爲中國方面，亦不宜優柔寡斷，應該根據旣定方針，予以考慮。其理由如下。</p>
<p>先就國際形勢來說，由本年年頭法意締結恊定，中經薩爾公民投票直至最近奥總理戈林親赴波蘭，英法共同宣言，一連串的轼際事行，處處反影着國際的危機，處處反影着歐洲各國在所謂武裝和平之下所過提心弔膽的生活，同時又處處表現出歐州各國人民厭惡戰爭的心理，處處表現出歐洲各國政府避免戰爭（或者至少可以說是延宕戰爭），維持和平的苦心和努力，歐洲局面總算有了暫時相安的可能。所最足爲世界和平之威脅的在東亞，而爲東亞和平最大之威脅的則是日本日。如果我們合指）算，日本退出國聯，至本年三月間，就要滿期，而華盛頓九國公約，海軍恊定又已於去年十二月間通告廢止，則我們可以明白今日的日本正是走着威脅世界和平的絶路（附記）。正所謂千鈞一髮，要掀起戰爭，在這個時候，要維持和平，也在這個時候。也是所謂懸崖勒馬，日本國民，自窮苦大衆，以至於重臣，學者，元老，軍人，都應該在這個時候，平心靜氣，替日本終極的利害，替東亞和平，替世界和平，再三再四，反復打算。此其一。</p>
<p>再就中日關係來說，那些同文同種的話，都不必提，單就經濟一點來講，日本是一個先進的工業國家，中國是一個廣大的農業國家，日本是一個海島國，中國是一個大陸國，在國際分業一個原則之下，中日兩國間的經濟關係中無可分離，無可割裂的，須知道，軍事侵略政治控制是十八九世紀軍國主義者所用的方式，這個時代已經過去了。國際間的分業與聯繫，是世界經濟活動發展必然的結果，尤其是集團經濟所必經的過程，在這種趨勢之下，一切畸形的結合，必然解體而代之以平等的，自然發展的分業與聯繫。在方式，其結果，一定是得不償失。只要算一算佔領東北所費的力量以及這兩三年來在東北所造成殖民地資本與帝國資本間的衝突就可以明白了。在中國方面，也應該知道，國際間的分業與聯繫，和經濟侵略，雖然相差甚微，但不是全無判别的。我們不能說中國没曾取得平等地位没有相當國九以前，在中國裏頭一個日金，一個英鎊，一個美元，不會包含侵略的意義，但我們也不能說一個英鎊到了紐約便侵略了美國，一個美元到了倫敦便侵略了英國，這種說法，似乎滑稽，其實也可以見得國際間的關係，好比微分積分，愈分愈微，愈積愈近，錯綜複雜，絶不是一個簡單的印板的加减乘除的算術公式所能解答的。而所謂平等的地位，所謂國力，旣不能一蹴即就，也决非口單拿那一件事便可以比較估量的，全視乎事態的發展以爲斷。所以我個人以爲在這個原則之下中日兩國間的經濟關係，有予以考慮之可能與必要。此其二。</p>
<p>於此有當注意的：</p>
<p>其一，所謂正式談判，以恢復中日常軌之關係，如果日本方面確有誠意，中國政府應限據旣定之方針，開誠相與，無所謂放棄政策，無所謂改變方針。</p>
<p>其二，不承認僞滿是中國政府與人民一致共守之鐵則，有與此鐵則相違背或犯有事實的或形式的承認僞國之嫌疑的，根本無談判之餘地。</p>
<p>其三，在自由平等的原則之下，中國政府對於中日兩國間的經濟關係，可予以適當的考慮，但這種考慮完全以中日兩國間經濟上地理上的關係爲基礎，所謂中「滿」日集團，可謂滑稽之尤。</p>
<p>其四，所謂考慮兩國間的經濟關係，旣以自由平等爲原則，即絶對不能含有任何獨佔的或排他的性質，在同一的原則之下，中國自有其與歐美各國的經濟關係，換言之，中國仍必堅守旣定之方針，不聯歐美以排日本，亦不聯日本以排歐美。</p>
<p>其五，所謂考慮兩國間的經濟關係，旣明明說是經濟，即絶對不能附有任何政治的或軍事的條件。大阪每日新開所稱如果中國有一個人願意而且力能擔負統洽中國的完全責任者，則日本準備擴張對渠給予政治經濟軍事及其他助力云云，完全是日本對華傳統思想之最大的錯誤，我敢正告日本人，中國國发黨統洽下之中國，再不會有袁世凱第一，以簽字於變相的二十一條欵，中國决不會做朝鮮第二，以簽字於變相的所謂「亡韓」議定書，日本亦不必再以此相誘。中國如需需要日本之恊助，無論其在那一方面，第　必由於中國之自主，第二必以中國全國國民之需要爲前提。</p>
<p>還是一句老話，日本如果有打開中日僵局的誠意，那是很好的，但從大阪每日新聞的紀載看來，日本人傳統的錯誤，觀念，還未掃除，實在是一個極大的遺憾。民國二十四年，二月一日於上海。</p>

<h3>點滳</h3>
<p>— （陳藴素）</p>
<p>我们現在所需要的文學，是能果腹充飢的大餅，不是專供裝飾的奢侈品。</p>
<p>幸福之神，是不會平空地隆臨到人們的頭上，所以購彩票，買獎券的人，都是天下第一等大傻瓜。</p>
<p>從前人做事，往往是先見貨色後論價，先撒網兒後數魚：現在人却先開盤子後論貨，先數魚兒後撒網。</p>
<p>現代的社會，像萬花筒一般，從高樓大厦的豪門巨閥，到蓬户饔牖的貧民窟；從朱門酒肉臭，到路有凍死骨；從科學化的洋博士，洋碩士，到神權式的和尙尼姑應有盡有。</p>
<h3>賠了夫又折指</h3>
<p>— 望雲</p>
<p>新會的賭風是很盛的，大小賭館，徧及城鄉各處，尤其在這歲首的幾天，一般有劉盤龍癖的，都已指癢難搔，躍躍欲試，管什麽傾家蕩產，都到賭館裏去解解他們的賭饞。</p>
<p>鄕農張某，他是賭神菩萨的忠實信徒，愈輸愈賭，愈賭愈輸，大有［不到黄河心不死［的模樣。他的渾家吳氏屢次的苦陳，不什的流那眼中的泉，然而他反渾家的話，只當做耳邊的風。一聽得某處有賭館，他便踴躍輸將，不惜典衣質物，去孝敬他的賭餉。</p>
<p>有一天，他又帶了三元有餘的賭銀，到沙路墟賭館中去賭博，賭到結東，不但囊内錢空，而且負下空頭片計洋十餘元，竟没法可以清償，賭徒大譁，把張某幽禁在暗室裏面，施以毒打。張某不勝苦痛，便央懇在三天内清償，又請相熟的賭友做了保證，才得釋放歸家。</p>
<p>過了兩天，張邀妻往小岡墟購物。吳氏不疑，携籃而去，誰知一到小岡墟，便有人把吳氏扣留，示以乃夫的筆據，才知乃夫爲了償賭的緣故，已把吳氏在三十元價値之十，賣與小岡李某做小老婆了。</p>
<p>張某得了身價銀，以往沙路墟，償債以外，還要背城借一。誰知手術不靈，連戰皆北，錢囊裏面，又變做一空空如也「，歸家後，精神異常頽喪，偶一抬頭，見吳氏的照片，兀自掛在壁上—他想到小影尙在，人已充做了賣品，一時悲從中來，心靈上受了重大的激剌，奔入廚房，把切菜刀　斷了自已的食指，一時血流如注，人已暈倒—旋經隣右知悉，救醒後，送往醫院中去。賭徒下塲，不是賠了夫人又折指麽？</p>
<h3>談鈔票</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>「黑眼烏珠瞧見白銀子」，這一句話，現在是落伍的了，因爲雪白的大洋錢，在現在這個市面上流通着的，已是很少。東手接來西手去的，十分之九，都是花花綠綠的鈔票了。</p>
<p>「鈔票」這東西，衛生家說，是最易傳染傳染病的，因爲鈔票經了患有傳染病者的手，細菌便會附着在鈔票上面，由鈔票的媒介，而傳染到没有傳染病者。但是說雖是這麽說，我却從没瞧見過任何衛生家，拒絶收用没曾消毒過的鈔票。而同時呢，我也從末在街上檢到過衛生家所丢掉的鈔票。</p>
<p>我有一位朋友，對於鈔票，感到了一個特别的興趣，凡是經過他手的鈔票，都在　角上印上一個小戳子，或簽一個字。他是一個薪給生活者，每月有一百元多些的收入，但是據他說，這麽蓋戳簽字了三年了，只人一張十元的，三張五元的，曾第二次經過他的手，其餘的，一經用掉，便没曾再會過。</p>
<p>在内地裏，在交通不很便利的所在，却還有專用××銀行鈔票的習慣，而拒用别家銀行鈔票的，雖然别家銀行，在上海，正和××银行一樣的可靠，但在内地，可就有些兒不同。這正和從前上海流行着的「外國銀行鈔票最吃香」，同樣的不可理解。</p>
<h3>唐小姐</h3>
<p>— 王錫鏗</p>
<p>凡是認識唐小姐的人，誰也要承認伊是個尤物，是個可人。</p>
<p>唐小姐是身材苗條　，不長不短，粗細均匀，穿着一身合式的時裝，走起路温文爾雅地一步三挪，表現着是一個十足的摩登女性；而且更配上一張微黄而帶有桃色的瓜子形的臉蛋，烏黑的頭髮，修彎的蛾黛，潤朗的秋波，紅薄的嘴唇，眞是非常俏麗，非常俏麗。</p>
<p>並且這還不算。唐小姐更有一種特别的好處；就是待人也非常和氣，總是未言先笑，對任何人都表示好感。本來像唐小姐那麽美黑的面龐，已經是很動人的；何况那麽水嫩紅潤的臉頰上，加上兩個淺淺的笑渦，紅薄的嘴唇略略上掀，露出兩排整齊的玉齒，是多麽令人銷魂的一幅笑臉啊。</p>
<p>眞的，凡是領略過唐小姐的笑的人，誰都覺得這笑的微妙，嫵媚和包藏着無限的深意，神秘。然而也就在伊這淺淺的笑渦裏，不知陶醉了多小青年，顚倒了多少志士呢！</p>
<p>可是話又說過來了，唐小姐舉動雖然是這樣地温柔，表情雖然是這樣地和靄；不過伊也有會厭惡人的地方。因爲不說别的，假使你講起話來蠻頭蠻腦不中伊的意時，伊就會縐起眉毛嬌聲繑氣的駡你一聲「死江北老」的。</p>
<h3>踐踏</h3>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>狗迷與狗</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>女人愛狗之迷</p>
<p>在歐美各國，每一個家庭之中，差不多每個婦人畜有一頭以上的愛犬，這些婦人，也許傭役滿室，平日的家事，什麽都不高興自己去操作的，然而對於狗的食物，狗的洗浴，等事，却什麽都親自當心。伊們愛狗之心，甚於愛夫，興之所至，抱着愛狗，來幾個接吻，而且和狗接吻的習慣，女人多於男人，那些青春少女，不肯隨便和男人接吻，而對於所畜的狗，却高興去吻個不止，這個啞謎，也是我們所猜不透的吧？</p>
<p>吻狗傳染腫病</p>
<p>英倫威斯明士區有一位醫生，曾經發現一個婦人，因爲時常和狗接吻而病亡，這個婦人，有一種習慣，每天餵狗的時候，總要吻個不止，結果有一次伊是患病而不救了，那個紅十字會醫院的醫生，把伊用愛克司光照騐的結果，伊的肚裏，有一種水腫病胞囊。這種胞囊是由狗體中小蟲的卵丸傳入人體而結成的，所以證明因爲伊時常和狗接吻而傳到這種病菌，而且同樣的狗主，伊们爲吻狗而腹内有水腫病胞囊的，還有不少呢！</p>
<p>狗主因狗被捕</p>
<p>有一次，一個人犯了罪，他是一個愛狗者，他所養的那頭狗，差不多每天是寸步不離的。一天，他和另一個朋友坐在火爐的旁邊，他的狗也在一起，偵探是來到了，但這個偵探祇知道他是養一頭狗的，而和他本人是不認得的，這兩人之中，究竟那一個是罪犯，一時倒無法證明。聰明的偵探，想了一下，計上心頭，便走去有意把那頭狗踢一脚，狗主看見愛狗被人踢了一脚，便立起來要和那個人講理，可是那偵探便立刻探出手槍捕獲了這要犯。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　僻地輕官遠來强項令華廰盛宴外有可憐蟲</p>
<p>其中有個笑聲最爲高大的，那就是周有容縣長了。只聽到他大聲道：旣不爲朝廷不甚愛惜之官，那也就不受鄕黨無足輕重之譽了。哈哈哈！他的臉正對了這窗户，只看他那額頭上汗珠直冒，也就想到他豪情大發。其實也不止是他，所有在座的那些人，誰又不是臉上紅紅的。這時，菜正上到了煎猪排，這西安市上的大餐，本來也就無異中菜西吃，這小西天的西餐部，並不曾預備那盛菜的大盤子，只是多把人手，將盛好了猪排的菜盤，一次兩盤，分别的向客座分送了去。大槪這猪排煎的是不十分的熟，吃的人都不免努力去切，所以一片刀叉和盤子相碰聲，叮叮噹，很是熱鬧。張介夫在　窗外看到，心裏也就想着，這樣的吃西餐，那眞也不過排塲而已。這樣講排塲的所在，總有高廳長在内，但不知那個是的。當他如此的想着，少不得伸長𩓐子，向裏面望着。就在　這時，有一陣飛沙，自屋檐上撲將下來。把他的𩓐子裏，滿滿的灑上子許多灰。他倒退了兩步，向天空看時，早是月黑無光，呼呼的風，在頭上飛掠而過。自已這也學得好笑，從東方來的人，竟會没有看過人吃西餐，在窗外站着，忘了一切，這不是笑話嗎？遙遙的向玻璃窗裏看着，吃大菜的人，正自熱鬧着。同時，却有一種奇異的聲音，送入了耳朶。但是這並非嘻笑之聲，乃是嚶嚶的哭聲，順了風吹來。這小西天裏，會有了哭聲，自是可注意的事，他不能不尋聲而往了。（一三一）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>譬如像此刻，伊老人家正在和我講論同治的事情，這時候伊所說的話眞好算是句句出自肺腑，而伊的態度更是無限的鄭重懇　，要是我並不用十分關切，十分感動的神情來傾聽着，或隨便做一些足以使伊不快的行動，那就不用想再望伊能饒恕我了！卽使我把我這一生的時間全用來贖罪，一刻不離的在伊的足跟下長跪着，伊也斷斷不肯寬放我的！如此說來，伊不就成了一個可怕的瘋人了嗎，不，不，　别人也許未能瞭解伊的眞性情，但我至少已在感覺上領會了伊的性格之所以如此特别的緣故，實在是有一種推動力的；這禾種推動力是什麽呢？這是可以用兩個字來解釋的，便是痛苦]。</p>
<p>誠然，伊的地位，伊的權勢，以及伊的一切物質上的享受可說是儘足以使伊快樂了，但伊的内心上的痛苦，怎樣補救呢？統計伊的一生中，差不多是充滿着種種的不如意，和艱難辛酸之事。當伊妙年的時候，正像一朶將開的鮮花一樣，很姘麗，很活潑，而且伊的一顆心已很滿足地傾注在榮祿的身上了，不料驀地竟被選進宮來，做了咸豐的妃子，硬生生地的把伊的心上人抛在　一邊，這已是很够傷心的了！再加咸豐又是一個非常昏庸粗魯的人，一些也不懂得向伊温存，老是抱着博愛的主義，見了略有幾分姿色的女子，便個個都要收幸，因此竟没有什麽時間來用在伊身上了；他所給予伊的安慰是什麽呢？祇有一個兒子，而這個兒子偏又在弱冠之年天折了。（二四一）</p>

<p>（庚）縫紉刺繡科成績</p>
<p>一·總評</p>
<p>各省市刺繡成績、就大體言、精工巧妙、神采逼肖者居多、惟應設法使之通俗·簡易·實用·俾民衆有購買能力、享用機會、縫紉·編織·白繡·抽絲等、製法精良、顏色美麗、但關於縫紉之裁剪圖樣、極少表現、嗣後學習縫紉、對於裁算方法、應多加注意、</p>
<p>二·分評</p>
<p>㈠浙江杭州市立初級女子家事商業職業學校、有幾幅油畫刺繡、其針法色彩及影綫之向背、人物之神氣均佳、繡法完全用細綫繡成、薄而且密、美麗非常、非研究有素者不能製成也、此外尙有縫紉、編織標本鏡框多種、亦可供研究藝術者之參考、</p>

<h3>四·中小學勞作科成績評判</h3>
<p>一　總評</p>
<p>㈠本届展覽會中、凡屬農村需要之出品、所佔種</p>
<p>類不多、分量亦少、但魯、冀、察各省之多數鄉師及小學、均能注意及此、其他省市亦有少數學校、能以當地所產之蒲草、黄草、稻草、麥稈、麻皮、蘆葦、　柳、山荆等農產副物編成籃、簍、包、墊、蓆、繩、素、箕、帚、鞋、鞋、帳等應用器物、蓋此類敎材、需要設備甚簡單、原料又可隨地採取、以之敎授兒童及鄉師學生、除勞作訓練之敎育價値外、尙可有助於家庭、故可爲鄉村小學中一部份適宜的工藴敎村、其他若紡紗、織布、捻蔴、繅、絲、簡易農具之修理製造、草棚　架之搭建、粗布衣服鞋襪之裁縫補染······未見有出品、其中紡紗織布等工作、或因於設備缺乏、然洗衣、補襪等工作、固無關於設備而亦忽之、實爲本届展覽會一大缺點、</p>

<p>注音漢字銅模開鑄</p>
<h3>全國敎科書將改觀</h3>
<p>黎談在滬調查鑄造銅模情况</p>
<p>簡體字由錢玄同主稿將公佈</p>
<p>京滬方面國語已不推而自行</p>
<p>（北平快訊）敎育部國語統一會委員黎錦熙·汪怡二氏、於上月二十二日應部長王世杰之請、由平赴京、二十六日在部開會討論注音漢字銅模、及簡體字問題、議决由黎汪二氏赴滬調查銅模鑄造事宜、已誌前報、昨（八日）黎汪已由京回平、記者特訪黎氏、談話如下、</p>
<h3>全國敎科書報紙將改觀</h3>
<p>此次敎部進行此兩事之動機、實因國難當前、全國大多數人民缺乏民族意識、國家觀念、公民常識、一日有事、物質上旣難於抵抗、精神上更恐終陷於淪亡、中央已决定撥欵從速興辦短期的義務敎育、縮短約爲二年、强迫人學、成人敎育則由各地民衆敎育機關照常進行、但短期施敎、必須將文字難識難寫之障碍破除、否則必無實效、故將來義敎及民敎之敎科書與一般讀物、决定在漢字旁一律注音、即用此次銅模所澆之鉛</p>
<p>字排印、蓋注音符號固定聯繫於漢字、則屬稿時旣省逐字注音之勞、排字者亦獲舉兩得之效、省費貶價、亦且美觀、各書店如不用此項鉛字排印者、一律不予審定、禁止發售、全國報紙、亦將由政府執行民國十九年之部令、至少須闢一專欗、用此項鉛字排印民衆讀物、</p>
<h3>在滬調查鑄造銅模槪况</h3>
<p>此項銅模、若精製則須購備最新［製毌模機］、刻鑄銅版、三年之内、可將三四五共三號鉛字製成應用、但需費在十萬元以上、因漢字須改長方形、佔鉛字三分之一、旁加注音、合成正方、使排印時不多佔行間、則篇幅不至增多、書價方與民衆之購買力相當也、故須整寫整刻、工程較大、若用木鉛刻或照相銅版等等舊法、費可較省、但不如毌模銅版之精細深入、且耐久、至於粗製、則取各家仿宋長體字之較優者、旁排注音、合成翻鑄、則銅模鉛字、年半可成、費亦最省、現因印刻急需、大約當採此辦法也、此項銅模鉛字、因欲推廣於全國出版界印刷界、故以不許專利爲原則、因之上海商家、皆不能無條件而承辦、政府方面、終須籌出相當的經費云、</p>

<p>昨値星期一、按理銀行開關、收解較繁、惟目前廢歷新年、金融界全體祇做半天市面、下午照例無事可做、故業務上氣象頗覺岑寂、兼之去蠟市百不佳、現下大部份抱緊縮主義、不肯儘量貿易、職是各方面市况、類率不動、市塲中洋拆價格雖在緊急之候、亦不致上漲、早市祇做六分、與前日相埒、劃頭加水、因無午市市面、故無市價、拆票交易、早市轉賬一百七十餘萬、新交易四十餘萬、客路來源、計寗錫兩處來財神洋十五萬、去胃毫無、洋押欵交易無聞、祇還押三十萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵九十餘萬、各種貨滙押墊雜欵收解二百八九十萬、收洋米欵一百四十餘萬、特滙欵四十餘萬、進倉十萬、華商銀行收解票欵一百零數萬、各種貨滙稅押墊雜諸欵收解二百六七十萬、解洋米欵一百二十餘萬、特匯欵五十餘萬、電滙欵四十餘萬、進出倉平、日商銀行收解票欵五六十萬、各種貨滙雜欵八九十萬、特匯欵四十餘萬、出倉二十萬、錢堅莊洋公單收解五百五六十萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百二十餘萬、各路洪滙欵二十餘萬、收現十餘萬、又本市票據交換所十一日交換總數、銀元五百八十三萬六千七百十九元九角六分、内計銀元四百零九萬四千一百四十九元零三分、滙劃銀元一百七十四萬二千五百七十元零九角三分、</p>
<h3>輔幣市價下跌</h3>
<p>昨日各種輔幣市價、大致下游、江南小洋、早市爲八百二十元、較前日改小十元、做出交易三千角、廣東小洋、呈市爲七百五十五元、較前日亦跌小三元八角、做出交易四萬五千角、銅元改長二千文、爲三百十九千文、交易五萬一千零四十串、合代價洋一萬六千元、午市各價一律停市、</p>
<p>證劵　債劵紛紛下跌中</p>
<h3>念三關獨漲四元</h3>
<p>公債市塲上之反常狀態</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、洋拆六分、略高四分、環境上安定如故、惟人心似較虚軟、各帮大都均係賣出於湧、獨對於廿三關奮勇吸收、不遺餘力、境在各種行市跌勢甚勁時、照其記賬價格、猛漲不已、竟在一盤中、漲逾四元而宣告停拍、此種極度反常之畸形狀態、先例甚少、市塲傳說紛紜、亦無確切有理消息、或謂财部擬將廿三關完全收回、收發廿四關二萬萬元、其還本照廿三關减半、此說似亦不能成立、因政府在廿四關未曾發出之前、先欲籌數百萬元、收回已在市面流通之廿三關近千萬元、且此種辦法、事前毫無所聞、或爲謠傳、未能確信、或謂因廿三關在市流通額甚少、資本家不難籠斷、則此種舉措、先例甚多、惟同時其他各債劵、亦必隨之而上漲、斷無背道而馳、相差如此之鉅、或謂有鑒於廿三關條例之優厚、金融界售出其他各種、收進廿三關、因此引起軋定、此理稍覺近似、刻下廿三關已至九折、三月份期貨市價、與票面餘額祇差九元、其中原因、究屬何如、一二日内、必可暸然、趨勢前途、或因廿三關之狂漲而趨上、昨日經過、市面極爲紊亂、開盤四號五　十一。等頗有賣出、各種債劵趨跌甚猛、廿二關跌七角半、拍廿三關時、塲内空氣驟緊、開價即漲二元二解、其時以十一·二十三·四十七及四十八號數家、買進最湧、市價跳漲甚狂、不旋種而漲逾四元、宣告停板、次盤市價、賣户仍甚踴躍、市價再小二三角至六七角、廿三關以追證關係、暫停、市價結果、除廿三關獨漲停板外、餘均趨跌、計小二三角至一元产不等、成交總數、計共一千六百四十萬一千元、茲將其漲跌結果、列表比較於左、（單位元成交單位面元）</p>

<h3>紗花　紗花受環境牽制</h3>
<p>紗市又轉疲弱、環境惡劣、上海金融狀况不安、人心仍無興奮氣象、但有一部分仍謠傳某種問題一旦實行、大利買方、所以拉緊之額、堅不吐放、惟二十支日紗價較華紗低廉十元光景、市面之壓迫可以想見、</p>
<h3>金鷄靜疲</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈平疲、因海外棉業微跌、上日謠傳某種問題仍屬不確、兼之現紗交易、不　上日之多、市塲愈顯冷淡、結果近平、遠跌二三·四角、午後開盤仍平靜、據調查所得通成公司對於二月期仍有交貨之說、因經濟太緊之故也、塲中成交極形寥落、拍開黑板尤多、足見商業之凋敝、查賣出大孚一千二百包、大豐六百包、賡豐四百五十包、元一三百五十包、合興二百五十包、買進明德三百包、潤康二百五十包、愼記二百五十包、長豐三百包、永昌　百包、潤康二百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>花市微軟、因海外印美棉市又露萎靡、而匯兌放長、金價趨跌、故上日一　　　挺之氣、又見消散、但通州帮及通濟公司之多額、關緊始終不放、然現棉消費極帶云、</p>
<h3>鄭標散漫</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月均見軟化、因印美棉市一致回跌、匯兌見長、塲中買者寥寥、市面殊覺渙散、毫無振作之象、各月微跌五分、午後開艦仍變遷、但金價回小七八元、而市上人心未受颢影響、實係多頭關緊不放、然環境不良、結果乃平、賣出同興八百担、仁豐八百担、潤康七百担担、長和一千二百担、遠大七百担、長豐六百担、買進賡豐一千二百担、生源一千九百担、源大九百担、吉豐八百担、長餘六百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>上週印棉獨見堅昂</h3>
<p>丨英國棉市結不少丨</p>
<p>孟買　週初因多頭了結、棉農套賣、需要不振、市價跌小、其後因傳言歐洲某大公司大買白羅溪花、上漲甚速、除空户抵補及投機買進四五月期外、尚有買進白羅溪、而在利物浦賣出者、亦有掉至七八月期者、同時塲中投機者復從事買進、故市况堅昂異常附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>利物浦上週現貨交易甚佳、期貨因等候金條欵案之解决、同業咸抱觀望態度、將至週末、老多頭紛紛了結、但爲零户所吸收、週末空户抵補、市况趨堅、埃及棉因美棉市况不定、多頭脫手、市價疲軟、</p>

<h3>糧食　津帮抽裝本月粉</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份大致穩俏、至洋麥無正式報告、據私人消息、則回漲三四五角不等、當開價時、本月份市氣、初尙平定、旋以天津帮抽裝、人心即步步良好、遠期因春雪續見、就歴年之經騐、未钢免與小麥年成、不無影響、故買氣頗盛、客帮亦略有買進、致市面亦逐步上升、廠方情形、聞祇阜豐略有套售、餘均未出、照目下情形、如北銷續辦、本月份尙有帶好之勢也、結果本月份回漲三分、三月份漲二分半、四五月份漲三分半、六月份漲二分、七月份漲一分半、</p>
<h3>麥市爲春雪帶好</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈良好之象、因洋麥無無報告、人心當少根據、不過春塞較甚、春雪續見、以習慣推測、麥市前途、或有此些微之影響、故開價後、市氣即見良好、各月份交易亦見活絡、喊價均漲上三分不等、迫至下午開盤、近期市面、仍見穩固、續好一分、遠期因買氣較寂、并略有洋麥套售、微見小弱、結果本月份漲四分、三月份漲三分、四月份漲二分、現麥因廠胃不動、又無做開云、</p>
<h3>雨霽米市續升角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）因舊曆新春紅盤初開之際、到船似乎見少、抵埠祇兩號、銷塲本街方机轉動　、景象續呈升色、蘇同帮粳價加起一角、南港早稻增數分近角、青角等帮晚稻雖客路包胃較前似覺遜色、祇青島帮辦三四百包、結果卒以到稀人心頗好、升上角砠、至亽杜洋尖及陰元等各花色、遂亦相隨並秀焉、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路到船上餘號、因前日新春開市、天雨斛出無幾、昨日統市斛出河廠貨約在七千石左右、市上各貨去胃平淡、本客變元市形看疲、嘉善早稻價短數分、中次北粳及薄稻價亦無鮮色、客尖價形挺定、其餘各色市上不多、價形均無上落、</p>
<h3>客秈步漲角許</h3>
<p>西貢存到兩多價小五分</p>
<p>昨洋米市况、本衛胃口　　、　洋米市上　底甚　、而到　亦　不絶、自本月初起到船已有六七號、市上存米更多、銷化祇紅盤第一天尙見莊暢、昨日西貢米祇開二千五百包、價乃壓小五分、還邏注存到較少、尙能挺站、惟客秈存到兩少、產價又爲報大、販運不劃、人心本在看好、昨日有南京帮試辦、内地本街亦有應酬、故各秈一律步升七八分至角外不等、全日開三千多包、盡係内地及南京辦去、</p>
<h3>黄豆續漲角外</h3>
<p>昨日黄豆行情、比週六除漢口豆因胃細市　定外、餘均續漲一角至角半、良以廠銷健潑、人心頗好、午後收市、客帮餅銷略懈、致市氣稍呈定局、昨統市計廠家辦去大運四平街豆十八車、價扯四元三角半、頴州豆八車、價扯四元、全河豆二車、價爲四元零四分、蚌埠豆一車、價爲三元九角、歸德豆千餘包、價扯四元零二分、内地及本街採取漢乍豆千餘包、價自三元七角七至六角八、福州帮及内地帮辦去漢遲豆七百餘包、價自三元七角半至六角六分、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮青續開三千餘包</h3>
<p>丨隆青地價升一角丨</p>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢穩定、公會划盤二四粗砂白叫原價未成、糖業合作公司續有標售、粤粗砂白批、計八面百三十包、價爲十七元角無上落、又　　轉口　粗砂白四百斤千凶、價　五元、比前　去　　、本廠綿白無變動、潮青　汕頭　訊下檔地價漲起一角、趨勞轉定、故各行進意尙濃、號方續有開出三千外包、提莊青十元五角、黄崗青十元二角、次者略减、半南青九元八角、隆港青九元六角、比前日無上落、</p>
<h3>南北貨　桂元枝乾略有成交</h3>
<p>桂圓茘枝行盤雖然議漲、但銷路未旺、僅有零星應酬交易而已、故行號間成交不多、且建帮因市稱折扣未决、無正式開盤、昨聞廣帮稍有開出、頂上瑞昌枝開至五十二元、京炮圓開二十四元、高京炮二十八元、建帮暗盤開亦有小數成交、生晒圓肉爲四十六元半、普通大粒圓三十元七角、比去臘升一元至半元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　平水珠茶歐銷略動</h3>
<p>昨茶市交易依然清淡、路莊珍眉綠茶、因上星期發出電報、杳無音訊、市面仍在沉悶中、惟平水珠茶、昨市錦隆天祥等行、略有進胃、全市共山公升永永興隆等茶棧、發出一百二十餘箱、定價爲五十二元、市盤較前數週仍無上落、</p>
<h3>五金　五金交易漸見進展</h3>
<p>五金交易、　日頗存進展、蓋天氣晴亮、客　方面、因運輸裝船、已無困難、所以零批採辦、已比前爲衆多、而各工廠方面、亦多開工、故添辦五金品已比前爲進步、茲將各種主要花色、分誌於下、</p>
<p>、會司鐵　昨日開出二三百箱、係青島烟台等客帮及本街製罐廠等購去、價每箱三十元、查新近此貨到乾不多、而定價又硬、所以市氣十分堅固、</p>
<p>英鋼板　長江路青烟津徐諸帮、昨市俱有收買、聞成交四五百塊、價二厘半開九元二角半、比紅盤小二角半、半分七厘半均　開七元、聞遠期抛貨則行情尙又低廉一二角云、</p>
<p>青鉛　紅盤開十四元七角、實際買賣、尙可低廉一角、聞交易三百餘辦擔、係油漆公司印書房等辦去、客帮及茶帮交易、因爲時尙早、無大成交、土鉛開十四元一二角、是以洋鉛行情尚要再小也、</p>
<p>小廣皮　祇有零數買賣、其價開十元零二角半、而實際成交則在十元光景、此外大廠皮除五張花色、因軍界有收辦外、其餘花色悉無成交云　　純銻　近日純銻行情祇開八百元、比紅盤小二十元、交易祇有另數、洋莊及鉛字房仍無發動、人心極軟、後市有看小可能云、</p>
<p>東白鐵　邇來生意仍少進步、市勢極疲、行情比紅盤各小二三分、昨漢口九江南京寗波福州諸帮尙有添辦外、别帮殊少指染者、其價六尺開九角四五分、七尺一元二角云、</p>

<p>浪漫主義問題的討論之重要性，在現實主義的口號鄭重地被注意的現在，是用不着我再在這裏贅述的了。有些人们，也許以爲單在理論上的討論，不當紙上談兵，無益於實際的。這話我並不想全部地加以否認；那些不顧具體的現實條件，囫圇呑棗地堆砌了許多外國作品的名字，用混亂的邏輯，人云也云地加以按說的文章，其在實際上的效果，恐怕不只於無益吧。反之，那種具體的切實的介紹和研究，則非但有益，而且是非常地必要的。</p>
<p>關於我們現在所需要的浪漫主義是怎樣的的問題，文壇上已有過相當的介紹；即在去年十一月十七日的本刋上，也有過企先生的「現實的與浪漫的」一文，作了簡要的提叙。不過這一問題，是相當複雜的。從來的文學吏家，對於浪漫主義的檢討，都感到無上的困難，或更因此而顯示出混亂。在文學理論進入於新的發展階段的今日，也還没關於這問題的正確而周備的見解，雖然主要的原則，多少是被確認了。</p>
<p>作爲一種嘗試，我在這裏重新把這問題提出來。首先，是想根據妥當的文學史上的成果，窺透出在過去的浪漫主義的文學中，顯然地存在着兩種本質的地全然不同的傾向來。因爲這末一來，也許當我們談到「我們的浪漫主義是什麽」這問題上時，更能得到有力的根據。</p>
<p>浪漫主義的發生之社會的原因，是因爲社會的變革所致起的。在社會變革的過程中，主要地分成了兩種不同的傾向：一個社會集團在直通歷史的墓塚的暗道上行走，另一個社會集團則在直通歷史的舞台的「生路」上邁進。在本質上，這是全然相反的兩種傾向；可是，谊兩種傾向都是經過同一的現象的。打個比方說，這「暗這」和「生路」，儘管它們的趨向是正反對的，但它們都必須經過社會變革期中的一段黑暗的隧這。這時候，不論是走在「暗道」上的人們或是走在「生路」上的人們，都在黑暗的包圍中；因此都發生了一種「空想」。更困爲社會的主觀的不同，使這「空想」也分成了正相板對的兩種：一種是雖然感到周圍的黑暗，但因其本身就是這黑暗的一部分，所以儘管他們的「空想」帶着種種的形態，在本質上却是對於黑暗的謳歌；另一種同樣地感到黑暗，然而他們却通過了黑暗的現實，對光明作熱烈的憧憬，向黑暗作酷厲的憎恨和反抗。在這兩種不同的基礎上，便產生了兩種不同的浪漫主義：退化的和進化的。</p>
<p>從過去的史實看來，更使上述的話，加上一層確信。十八世紀末葉到十九世紀初葉，西歐的社會經濟起了急激的轉變，贅本主義的生產樣式的確立與發展，使封建制度日趨没落。這時候，作爲封建制度的藝術形式的古典主義，便受到了浪漫主義的否定和批判。例如古典主義所具有的一般的合理的傾向，三一律等等，都被新興的浪漫主義所楊棄了；但這都是和古典主義對立的浪漫主義的標識，並不是浪漫主義的本質的特徵。倘若我們進一步地從各國的浪漫主義中找尋那本質的特　來，那末，兩種不同的浪漫主義就顯現在我們的面前了。在英國，施可特（Scott（，拜倫，）Byion）威茲威士(Wordiworth)的浪漫主義，是還化的；珂立紀(Coleiige)，索紀(Soulhey)，哥德文(Codwin)，雪萊(Shelley)的浪漫主義，却是進化的。同樣地在法國和德國的浪漫派文學中，也可以找出退化的及進化的兩種來。屬於前者的如法國的沙沱白里安(Chaloaubriaubriand)，亞關尼門(Vigne)，德國的胡格（F·Fouque），亞關尼門(A·Arnim)等等；屬於後者的如法國的　俄(V·Hugo)，桑特(HHeine)，德國的霍夫曼(AH)</p>
<p>offnann，海湼(HHeine）等等。退化的浪漫主義同情於貴族階級的没落，他們的「空想「不管貴族階級的送葬歌；進化的浪漫主義却以可怕的熱力，謳唱着資本主義的誕生曲。有些作家如桑特和海湼，則是這兩種浪漫主義的兼有者。我在這裏只能簡單地這樣歸納一下，因爲我不能在這篇小文章裏來作着文學史的研究。</p>
<p>凡歷史上的新派，因爲它的主觀要求跟歷史的客觀現實的發展相一致，所以它的藝術，是現實主義的。但是，照前面所叙，新派在抬頭的時候，却必然地具有「空想」的浪漫主義的表現，這在表面上看來，不是很衝突的見解麽？可是，事實上這見解却是不會衝突的。前面已經說過，進化的浪漫主義是從現實出發的，這些浪漫蒂克的「空想」，正如一個血氣方剛的青年所抱的反抗現實的浪漫的意意志似的，是現實的。因爲他旣對現實抱反抗之心，便和那種不敢正視現實，逃避現實的人們迴然異質。到這裏，我們可以得出一個結論：凡歷史上新興的文學，必然地是「現實的與浪漫的」。</p>
<p>也正是因此，鑨統地說浪漫主義的文學都是「以澈頭淯尾的主觀的觀念論的態度去對付現實的」這話，非加以相當的界限丨即那所說的浪漫主義是退化的一種丨便容易致起誤解的。因爲對於進化的浪漫主議，如雪萊，海湼等人，在哲學的意味上，我們毌寗說那是現實主義的。</p>
<h3>一隻熱鍋上的螞蟻</h3>
<p>— 林秋</p>
<p>失眠的深夜，死一般的靜寂，我用回憶的鏡子照五六年來的自已，這時顯現在鏡裏的，是一隻熱鍋上的螞蟻。</p>
<p>被一根無形的毒辣的鞭子從鄉村趕到都市，又從都市趕到鄉村：碰壁，蹉跌，傪痛，呼號，掙扎；身體一天一天地瘦了，靈魂也一天一天地瘦了，然而依然這樣兜着　子，無止息地，無例外地，正如一隻熱鍋上的螞蟻。</p>
<p>是的。現社會是一隻火熱的大鍋，我就是這熱鍋上的螞蟻。</p>
<p>一個悶熱的夏夜，我帶着一身淋漓的熱汗、逃出了火房似的亭子間，躺在曯台陰凉的水門汀地上，對着燦爤的星斗，默默地吐着在生活和氣的雙重壓迫下的問氣。一個迅雷一般的火警，使我在三分鐘内，忍痛地犧牲了自已全部的財產丨兩架零亂的舊書。</p>
<p>挾着一隻破舊的小皮箱，踏着躺在深宵的靜　中的　凉的馬路，經過長時間的思案，敲進異國同伴的房門。一間月租五元的小小的亭子間，没有電　，没有樣子，没有　，　有凉　，　　的　　上的　　　　紙，報紙上躺着三個赤膊的朝鮮青年。他們淡然問了幾句之後，又呼呼地睡去了。我哼了一聲沉重的歎息，在牆脚找到了自已的床位。</p>
<p>接着，照例被一根無形的毒辣的鞭子從都市趕到了鄉村，趕到鄉村的小學裏。半載以來，爲了適應惡劣的環境，我不得不在自已眞實的容顏上塗着虚僞的臉譜。對同事虚僞，對學生也虚僞，對外界的朋友更虚僞。戴着虚僞的假面，在十分無謂而又十分繁忙的工作的壓榨機下過着像泰山　樣沉重而又像眞空一樣空　的生活。</p>
<p>紀得一天星期六的夜晚，苦痛和無聊使我勇敢地喝了超過本來酒量四倍以上的黄酒，死人似地倒在桌下了。在完全失却了知覺的爤醉中，我像火山决口似地吐出數月來積壓在胸頭的眞話：嚴刻地批評了每個同呈的劣跡，第二天醒來，發覺自己已闖了大禍，可是來不及補救了。結果慘酷的命運，幾乎又落到我的身上來。</p>
<p>伴着一顆顫抖的心，好容易挨過了一學期，我下期不能而且不願在這裏了。像一隻熱鍋上的螞蟻，我又要從鄉村爬到都市去了。都市給與我的難堪的苦痛，已被深深地掩埋在這半年來所受的另一種痛苦中了。我此刻漢然地感覺到一種空前的幸福的生活在還還的都市　等待着我，正如我在離開都市對於鄉村的感覺一樣。</p>
<h3>貧梯江頭自綄紗</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>愁來碰人</h3>
<p>— 藏克家</p>
<p>「千家笑語漏遲遲，憂　潛從物外知。</p>
<p>獨立市橋人不識，一晨如月看多時。」</p>
<p>吃罷了親手治辦的年餃，四處的爆竹已經響成了炸豆，聰著深汀和從遠方來的一位友人在敲著棋子，在一盞燈光下我記起了黄仲則的這詩句來。</p>
<p>在封建時代，逢着鷄犬不驚的太平盛世，在鄉村裏度著年夜，那情味是再神秘没有的了。而我們的時人偏捨開團圓的家庭在這家家笑語漏遲遲的時分一個人跑到凄凉的橋頭去看一個星斗，這行動看來古怪，想來却並不古怪·中國以往的詩人，大半是善於尋愁覓恨的，「爲寫新詞强說愁」是「愛上層樓「的原因，那麽獨立市橋看星斗又何足怪呢？</p>
<p>在這天涯的年夜裏，守著一壁燈光，就讓心硬如鐵也免不了「憂愁潛從物内知」了。這一夜眞有些不同，你不想想什麽，而什魔偏紛紛的呌你非想不可。</p>
<p>在這活着大不易的中國，年關眞是個鬼門關。在都市裏只覺得錢包緊，看見一張張紅貼把一些商店的大門封死了，報不下歇業因而自焚的也儘有。經濟的繩索緊扣在每個人的頸上，多少性命就這樣被絞死了。鄉村本像一個瘦鬼，一聰見「年關」馬上筋銷肉化一變而爲骷髏。人人背上負着重僨，身上連件棉衣也做不上，每家大門前你會看見人和人爲着錢爭吵，厮打，凶惡的狗抱住要賬人的杆子。好人也會變成了「時下生心」的强盜，拿一柄菜刀躱在山溝裏候着財神。一匹布，一吊木會把你弄成個「路倒」。年關一近，人的膽好似頓然大了，而悲慘的新聞也新陳代謝的被大家講論着了。</p>
<p>前天一個住在鄉下的學生寫來了下面的信：「現在我的鄉村破產的不成個樣子，整日裏聽不見别的，只聽得這家賣宅，那家當土，因爲連年旱災，虫災弄的五殺不收，人民衣食不足，就我們本地說，每年每畝地應攤的官稅私稅不下一元多錢，你想衣食都不充足，這些錢向那裏去出？典地當土没有人要，有的把自己的女兒賣了，有的逃債不敢回家。有一個名詞不知老師知道不知道，就是「報鼓」。這是說負債還不起，把自己所有的一切全出賣凈，最後請債主們一桌客，還上清的也就算了。這「報鼓」的事我鄕下常有，快到年的這幾天更利害。再者，過年過不去窮人有的上了吊，有的花五六分利取錢。我家經濟破產，下學期爸爸不讓我再幹了，我一直哭了三天，也没法！老師你想想這是個什麽世界呀！」</p>
<p>今夜我想起了這個可憐的學生，我想起了破產的鄉村和都市，想到了天下的一切痛心的事情。我不跑到市橋上去看星斗，坐在這燈光下，憂愁在鞭炮聲中却來碰我的心了！</p>
<p>舊年夜</p>
<h3>洛口遊記（下）</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>㈡洛口一瞥</p>
<p>翻過一個戴雪的士隄，鐵橋修長的黑影和城牆灰黄的姿態，便在雪地裏惹眼地現了，這就是我們所要到的洛口鎭了。剛才走的還是較爲平整的汽車道路。至此，通到洛口的，却成爲高低不平全爲雪掩的爛路了。進城之後，路更壞得一堪，車常常陷在雪泥中，進退爲難，欲下車來，又無立足之地，這裏眞算是走到老中國了，只有由車夫息下車來，互相帮助，慢慢地將前面的車，前推後推地移過難關，然後再搬後面的車。這樣一來，使拉車的倍爲辛苦，坐車的也感到狼狽。本來想到較爲熱鬧的地方去看，也完全打消了，只揀靜僻的地方，直向黄河邊上走去。</p>
<p>洛口鎭的北面城牆，卽是黄河的隄梗·在街上走着時，就看見了好些帆檣的上端在隄頂露了出來。河水是亦如其名是黄的，現在還没有凝結，水上浮有無數的冰塊，都是房子那麽大的，緩緩地順流而下，很是好看。先前在電影裏面，看見春天解凍的伏爾加河，彷彿實際出現在我的眼前一樣。據說去年這些時候，河上早已凝着很厚的冰了，驢車馬車便在上面自由地走過哩。</p>
<p>如果没有三兩隻載貨的木船，在浮冰之間慢慢行駛，和載滿搭客的小船，緩緩渡到彼岸去，河上倒是很荒漠的，因爲河水旣不凈潔，冰塊出現出髒污的樣子，日光照着時，又全反射不出燦然的光輝來，丨也許是我們站在南岸，北月着了太陽的緣故吧。</p>
<p>河隄上有洛口車站，鐵軌分兩股，都臥在雪中。一股彎去和津浦路會合，一股則筆直伸着，經過黄河鐵橋下面，與津浦路剛好架成十字的形式。車站旁邊，有好些農村少年，裝扮成了各樣的男女角色，足下均綁以尺多高的木足，作着舊戲上的行路姿勢，旁邊則奏和着鑼鼓等樂器，宛如演劇一樣，看的人，却没有演的人多，大槪他們是趁此寂寞的雪天，作戲來娛樂自己吧。</p>
<p>㈢黄河鐵橋</p>
<p>看見鐵橋帶着鋼鐵的姿影，雄健地橫臥在黄河身上，覺得髒污的黄河，越發顯得衰弱可憐，如同給人用粗大的鍊子銷着一樣。同時恍忽覺得現在老中國的命運，也有些和這相像哩。</p>
<p>黄河鐵橋是德國工程師修的，橋頭上記的全是德文字。長千二百五十米達。</p>
<p>橋上，中間是津浦的鐵軌，兩旁則爲人行道，我們剛想上去走走，兩個在石屋前面晒着太陽看書的守兵，便說道：</p>
<p>「先生不要在上面走，只許在橋頭看看」。</p>
<p>聽說先前是可以行人的，現在却連遊人的佇立也禁止了，不知是爲了舉麽原因，但守兵的態度和語調，都很和靄的，不像從前的兵有了槍，就現出十分驕横目無老进姓的樣子。當我們在橋頭展望的時候，看書的兵，仍舊埋頭看他們的書，同時石壁屋裏又鑽出幾個光頭的守兵來，在路邊建立的槓架上，專心地綀習體操，他們那種誠樸的樣子，實在令人生敬。不知怎的在此時我對於這些守橋兵士叝感到很大的興味，把觀看河景的眼光，不時掉射在他們的身上。臨去，從那一心只在埋頭看書的兩個守兵身走過時，下細一看，才發見他們看的是精忠說岳傳哩。</p>
<h3>高空（一）</h3>
<p>— Henri　Barbusse著狄舟譯</p>
<p>第五時，我們在北非洲的内地補足糧食。我們降落在彩飾着電車·街路·都市的歐洲的色彩雜亂的文明當中。我們在道路上走着，上面，衝着飛機的鼻面發出臭氣的波動，落下來的聲音，可以聽到。</p>
<p>···某天早上，我們飛到嵌在非洲沿岸的綠色之中的白而大的棋盤後面。我們的飛機，靠近直布羅陀海峽，斜斜地飛過。在西班牙畫了切綫又飛走了。我们在歐洲空中的飛　，對於我們是在氣層的最上層試騐速力的期間呢。歐洲在我們底下，捲滅在旋風裏面。時速三百基羅米突的大緩慢飛行。大陸，島廠地出現的物體，由上方掁來五十基羅米突的視野。（一小時·兩千法郎的揮發油和煤油）。</p>
<p>苦惱和惡夢的夜，在地上的事物之間竪挿着。</p>
<p>偶然地，那無限波長的叨念裏，來了意料之外的無綫電話的呼唤，我看望住家在京都面悏嬰死的路易叔父去了。被親友們圍住，　着安　椅的叔父，還是依舊那麽莊嚴的。充滿温柔的愛嬌的面容，　進在穿着　院的便服的丨美麗的亞麻布袍衫和天鵝絨丨浪漫派詩人似的罩在苍的色的死的影了裏。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談集團結婚及其他</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>記得去年十二月日本家庭科學研究社，發表了一個世界略國結婚費用比較表，上面說空庭每年進益二千元者，其結婚費用年佔收入之分比，英國一，法國一，美二，意四，西班牙七，蘇聯八，日本二十至二十五，中國二十五至三十，而每年收入在一萬元者，則英國爲○八，法國一，美四二，意四，西班牙五，蘇聯八，日本十至二十，中國三十·</p>
<p>但是咱們樣樣落後，事事鬧窮，處處束手，惟在結婚費用的豪奢一點，幾乎考了第一。這也許是因爲咱們爲禮敎之邦，所以就把妇嫁男婚當作「終身大事」，平時各嗇促狹不要緊，惟在男婚女嫁的當兒到十分慷慨，甚至於拉扯借當變賣都在所不惜，何苦如此？原因就只有一個，講面子。講漂亮。</p>
<p>這樣一來，確把男女婚姻困難得成爲一件「終身大事」，試想想，要討一個老婆，從請媒十聘納采問名一直到迎娶，無事不須要從錢孔子裏鑽過，如伯件都依照舊有儀注實行起來，二萬萬男同胞有好幾個担當得起，敢於問鼎？就是出嫁一個妇兒，製嫁裝，趕陪奩，也一樣是一個靡費的虧累。所以有人說要一個女人，等於購買一部華美的汽車，價錢旣十二分的昻貴，事後的消耗開支也是駭人，這我想是一個親身體騐者的道理。</p>
<p>社會人士鑑此偏趨的現象，特爲提出婚姻的儉約運動，並從而倡導之，實行之，這一洞燭時弊的創舉，的確確大有裨益於社會。集團結婚卽是其中之一。聞北平市於去年曾决定徵求新夫婦五十對，缴結婚費十元，預定於今年元旦在中南海懷仁堂舉行婚禮，雖然下文如何不得面知，唯上海將於四月三日舉行第一屈集團結婚婚禮，則已實有其事。我想這對於將結婚看作買汽車一樣的人，總算是大開方便之門了。</p>
<h3>到家</h3>
<p>— 月山</p>
<p>到了家，覺得故鄉雖還是可愛的，但對故鄉的心懷，確乎不是離家時候的那樣了。亞第一，故鄉於我非常疏，第二，就說家裏，家裏也同前大不一樣了。</p>
<p>到家的第一天，來拜訪我的，孩子們當中，我認得的委少。一股悲哀之感，立卽衝上心來：我的小時的伴侶呢？我不覺要這樣喊！同時我又感到，不久之後，這一羣啼啼哭哭的伴侶們，大槪也會同我們一樣地感到失羣的悲哀了。</p>
<p>我的童伴，也像我一樣，被生活鞭到不可知的遠方去了，他們對於故鄉，大槪已没有什麽戀戀之感了吧？故鄕給他們的是什麽？是苦惱，是飢餓；故鄉並不能給他們以安慰，生活使他們不得不遠離鄉井，到另一個環境裏去掙扎！走過那個芭蕉園，那個黑色的大門裏，便就是我小時的一個同伴的家，如今那個家怎樣了呢？他父親病死在千里外的南洋，母親做了半世的孤孀，在青齒白眼的　境下也瞑目了。他，孑然一身，繼着踏父親的足跡，在南洋奔波：他的眼裏還有家嗎？啊！他的家！漏了屋脊了！太陽，月亮，風和雨，都可由那大棵的斷折處掃進去了，這就是他的家，故鄉在他的心裏，能給他以安慰嗎？</p>
<p>想到這個，我默然。怎樣故鄉變得這樣快呢？祠堂門前，還有昔日的南風在盜嗎？穿長衫，戴瓜皮帽，在高高的台階上敲着烟管話年成的秀才呢？一個社曾在没落着，我這樣想，祠堂便就是象徵了。</p>
<p>「祠堂的賬誰管？怎麽屋破得那樣？」我向我的哥哥問着。</p>
<p>「誰管？祠堂早没賬了！草蔓了一院子，誰管」祠堂是這樣的。我想起當年的春秋大祭，那和莊穆雍容的情景，猶在目前！而今日，才幾年？計算着，離家也不過六七年吧？怎樣變得這樣快？</p>
<p>「難堪啦！你不曉得！」哥哥幾乎是嘆氣似的。他也許還留戀着另一個社社會的景物。我有些可憐他，他原是讓生活壓得曲了脊梁的人呀！對於落没中的社會，他的留戀，在我也並不覺得可怪。我希望這個社會快些走到牠的没日，我將歡迎另一個新的，進步的，新的社會來臨。「舊的讓牠僵去，我們要努力，做新的。」我想這樣安慰我的哥哥，但我没有說出口來。我不可憐一個社會的没落，我可憐這個社會中人之老在留戀着舊社會的；更可憐着那些受着舊社會的殘害而不自知的人；他們心目中也有個明天，但這個明天　實在地過去了，而他們不知。</p>
<p>故鄉是變了，家也變了！父親帶哭地叙着母親的死况，他說：「母親望你振興家業的······」。我想哭。</p>
<h3>春雪</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>去歲大熱大旱，預料科季必大寒，然而適得其反，氣候温暖如春，四鄉麥已吐穗，荳亦開花，且有桃花怒放者。各地農民在大旱災之後，惟將希望付諸今年，望雪之殷，誠如大旱之望雲雨。蓋科天是虫類的蟄伏時期，在他們没有反抗能力的時候，降下臘雪，害稻之虫可以一網打盡，立春之後，虫類開始蠕動，然而編在立春之後降了兩次鬘雪，這在農事上是絶大的損失。</p>
<p>在人事上，一冬和暖，氣候乾燥，各處白喉，天花又爲害甚烈。這幾年做中國老百姓也够可憐，天災人禍，相繼而來，如今各地災民，流離失所，今歲再是個大荒年，眞是令人寒心！</p>
<p>不過對於住在三層洋房里的人們，臘雪都是無關，偶然高興挾美人兮遙望，賞玉宇兮瓊樓，或者作踏雪尋梅的壯舉，也是同樣偉大的！</p>
<h3>霜雪之晨</h3>
<p>— 羅姗</p>
<p>在那遠遠的沙漠附近，在那北方西山無太陽的山麓，在那西山積雪的晴天，發着銀樣光芒的時候，當淺紅色的晨曦在雪的西山上閃動的辰光，銀色的西山泛着耀眼的金色的彩霞。</p>
<p>山麓邊，那白楊搖曳着的深谷間，抖擻着一顆顆矮矮的樹影子，映在積雪的半山腰，耀着反映的奇蹟。</p>
<p>每晨，每晨，在霜露，在雪花之晨，那黑影子更顯著地在半山腰。</p>
<p>在虎獅般吼呌的西北風下，在尖銳若空氣無隙不乘的料峭的寒氣下，那耐寒的松樹竹枝以及黄色花朶的臘梅，昻頭在那里顧昐自雄。</p>
<p>山巓，尖頂的白色肺癆病養院孤獨地矗立着，霜雪覆蓋着，恍惚是座古希臘羅馬的廟宇，晚禱的鐘聲认古刹内傳出，凄絶地震碎着每個遊子的心靈。</p>
<p>吹嘯着悲怨調子的冬之風，盤桓於黄色花朶的臘梅下，在冬青樹旁，在竹枝頭頂。</p>
<p>害有孤獨癖的隱士。他自命「妻梅子鶴」的林和靖或是中古意大利著名畫家兼雕刻家的米契昻格羅，在風雪之晨，在那霜露的晨曦中，踽踽地躑躅於半山腰。</p>
<p>在雪花飄浮若浪花發有銀光的山凹間，呼嘯着一若鬼神號哭之抑楊的音節。</p>
<p>於他那深刻的臉之表情，心頭蓄藏着無盡的哀愁，世界已無致歡迎的藥材在。</p>
<p>在遠遠的沙漠之附近，在那無太陽的西山，在那積雪的晴天，那反襯有一幅圖畫似的閃動下，那兒，那兒躑躅着一個人間的精靈。</p>
<h3>掇拾與其他</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>據說可又是春天了啊。</p>
<p>走各和煖的郊外去丨是生長在田野裏的，也許想從春天的草上，能找到一些不完全的年青時代的笑，與明朗的意象吧？</p>
<p>那麽着，便靜靜地在泥路上走；把注意放到一朶野花，一簇小草，與一隻掠過水面的遊鳥上面去了。</p>
<p>記憶究竟是最痛苦的，還是最篚甜蜜的，那可誰都不知道：然而，記憶是無聊的，這我却相信。丨丨不是嗎？人在無聊的時候是没有理由的，也許呆坐着折斷一要要的火柴桿，也許走在野外隨便㧞取一兩根野草。</p>
<p>說是有閑的醜惡嗎？是的，這是無可否認的；但是也得明白：在病着的社會裏，「健康」是不存在的啊。</p>
<p>（有人唱起了遊島歌（Wandervogel），想：要是能聽到六弦琴的曲折的聲音呢？要是······）</p>
<p>意念像有一點兒抖動：這春野的掇拾啊，從這上面，我們將得到一點什麽呢？</p>
<p>然而這正像一個沈靜的謎，與眛的未來的命運，一點都不肯讓人預知的。</p>
<p>（自然現象並不是完全可愛的；你爲什麽祇去看淡青的花朶，與粉蝴蝶翅上的嫩黄呢？難道便那魔輕易地忘掉了雨天的小路的泥濘，與夜晚的荒郊的電雷了嗎？</p>
<p>一個駭濤，一陣狂風，在險惡的旅程上是不會缺少的：它們，也許像春野裏的一珦枝青花那樣地朦朧的啊。</p>
<p>走向春郊去掇拾的人，難道便忘掉了爲掇拾的獲得擔心了嗎？）</p>
<p>我是擔心着的，我怕啊。</p>
<p>也許有人曾把「活着」這件事。比過「探險」的吧？然而在我，却　總覺得用「郊外的掇拾」去比擬它適合得多。丨如果生活眞像探險那樣的，那我們眞該幸福得多了；我們總該能想像探險家的雄姿吧？充分的凖備，豐富的行裝，奮發的興趣，還有事實給他的昭示··前面是險惡，應該好好地凖備一下啊。</p>
<p>然而俳徊在生命的狹路上的人，難道也會有人給你那麽可貴的預示的嗎？</p>
<p>活着不也是那樣的嗎？徘徊像閑逸的春郊掇拾者，也許誰都想有一段明朗暢地漫步着，拾一點落下的成熟的果實，摘取一贱兩片青青的小草，欣賞着又吟味着，意念給載在一朶藍天的輕雲上，緩緩地飄開去了······</p>
<p>然而那樣的夢的實現是没有的啊。</p>
<p>走着污泥的小路，一失手，就會陷進地去了；不遠便打起了雷電，路是泥濘的：要是你打算掇拾一點的話，那便是枯萎了的樹枝，與絆足的小石塊了。</p>
<p>而那些乘着人們的不經意而襲來的寒冷的風雨呢？</p>
<p>一步步地走着黏濕的泥路，便勇敢地把那不偷快的枯枝與石塊檢起來了：人是應當有一個老年的：不錯，但是當老年的時候，除了豐滿地誇耀着一些過來的困陷之外·便還有什麽呢？丨說：那便是「生之經騐」啊。</p>
<p>我擔心了：春天難道也也會有和煦的氣候的嗎？難道也有人敢擔保春野拾掇者的收獲是可喜的嗎？</p>
<p>（可怕的是：季節的燥濕寒煖·與）</p>
<p>氣候的風雨晦明啊。</p>
<p>這年代，就運春都是不可靠的。記起了一名詩：</p>
<p>「一春晴日少·三月落花多！」</p>
<p>青春的郊原中的掇拾者是得擔心的呢。</p>

<h3>老聚的話</h3>
<p>— 伯翔</p>
<p>「過去一年裏給與你的是什麽呢？」倘然有人這末地問起老聚的話，那末，他可以爽直地回答你：「是一雙白鞋，一件灰布袍子」</p>
<p>「還有呢？」</p>
<p>「是幾千萬雙加倍輕蔑的眼晴。」</p>
<p>「還有呢？」</p>
<p>「是極度的失眠症，與强虺的神經衰弱。」</p>
<p>這就是他整整一年裏的全部收穫。</p>
<p>雖只給與他白鞋的第一分鐘他没在着，可是在失眼的長夜裏，他可以望着帳頂把家人告訴他的零碎片斷連接着幻想出來丨丨</p>
<p>是多麽悽慘那一幕啊！一個還没到噎氣年齡的人就這末迅速地噎了氣。</p>
<p>那是不該的。無論從那方面說，像他老人家的慈祥，忠實，是不該這麽迅速地總結他一生的；假使上帝有知的話，那末它該承認：這是安偶然的錯誤。</p>
<p>可是爲着這偶然的錯誤，就决定了老聚的命運。他的面上找不到笑，雖只在幾個給麺包他吃的人們面前，還得免强地練習一套：勉强把面上皮肉凑成的笑是痛苦的，和夜街頭裏出賣的女人的笑一樣，它裏面保藏着的：是淚，是悲哀。倘然你和他見面過的話，那末你可從他的衣着上猜出他的命運丨他是穿着給塵垢染成灰色的白鞋和沾滿污漬的布袍。頦下的鬍鬍黑葺葺的比他的歲數長上一倍，雖只是新年了，都不高興去修理它一下。</p>
<p>眞的，不幸的鐵帽緊緊箍信了他，連别人見到了都感到不幸似的。這話並没過份，有許多月友就這樣，尤其是快年底了，他們都恐怕老聚會開口向他們借錢丨他們是知道的，老聚的家境並没好丨一聽見他講起那個不幸的故事時丨這是他時常講起的丨他們都會像可憐似的，不，其實是輕蔑地瞧他一眼就走開了，他們都小看了老聚，他不過關不住心理的抑鬱對别人訴訴遭遇罷了。要他開口借，他不是這種人。他生就一種倔强的脾氣，情願自己緊一緊褲帶，不願弓着身子向人家開口。他是十分清白地支配自己用勞力換來的少數金錢，窮又何妨。</p>
<p>可是别人没理解他，他的人格給窮减了色。</p>
<p>（委屈地接受人家的輕蔑嗎？有些不甘心。怎麽辦呢？除非戳瞎了自己的眼睛！）</p>
<p>在四週寂靜的夜裏一個子獨醒着這末想。本來人家是輕蔑他的，現在加倍了。當然，這加倍的原因他知道的：和白鞋有關。於是那老人家噎氣的一幕又重複地在他的腦膜裏開映着。每夜，他總可以聽到明晨的第一小時。</p>
<p>越受人家輕蔑越這末想，越這末想越失眠，越失眠越神經衰弱：許多灰色細胞循環地在他的轿管裏奔騰着，他就這末灰色地過了上一年。</p>
<p>從今年起，他預備緊閉着嘴，不再和别人說起自己的遭遇。</p>

<h3>所必需具有的知識（下）</h3>
<p>— 細流</p>
<p>有些臨時演員，自己覺得他們不過是是些[空氣]，因此他們是無需乎背誦對的的。他們對於[空氣]的理想是不錯的。在默片時代，空氣本來是不說話的，但是自從片發明以來，觀衆們所希望的，作空氣或背境的，亦應該有聲音，所以，空氣到了聲片時代，亦一定要說話，笑和歌唱起來了。</p>
<p>譬方現在拍的，是一張上等社會的片子，那末攝影塲上的一切，都要能代表第五街的富麗堂皇，就是臨時演員，亦不能獨居例外。因爲導演隨時會叫攝影師掉過鏡頭來，向這處搖搖，向那處搖搖，收音機一時放在這裏，一時放在那裏，臨時演員們亦不知道，所以，就是他們不在鏡頭角度以内的時候，他們的談吐，亦應該小心些，一定要合乎上等社會的程度。現在不比默片時代了。在默片時代，一個演員開口說：[喂，啤酒在那裏？]譯成字幕，會變成：[寳貝，我愛你]的。因爲在　那時，嘴巴祇要能動而已。</p>
<p>還有在拍戲的時候，舉止態度一定要和你身上穿的衣服，嘴裏說的話相稱。一個演員一定要知道種人的習慣風俗，　如東部人吸紙烟，烟頭是往上橋的，西部人吸烟，烟頭是向下垂的等等。</p>
<p>許我片子之中，是夾雜着外國景幕的。在那些幕序中所用的臨時演員，就是法國人，意大利人，西班牙人等等。他們非但要形狀逼眞，并且要能說幾句外國語言，須懂得各該國的人情風俗，以及各該國的遊戲歌曲等等。才具寬泛的臨時演員，是可以扮演多少種類的角色的。就是先以美國式的角色而論，亦有無數種類可分。一個女子，今天扮演一位初入社交的小姐，明天做一個舞女，後天做一個别的東西。但是她一定須小心，不要將他們的個性態度混亂了。</p>
<p>對白聲音固然是臨時演員所必須綀習的、但是那還不够。現在　聲片時代，差不多每一張影片之中、總夾雜了一些音樂的，所以一個臨時演員，要是能唱幾支歌，彈幾種樂器，那是於他們的前途，很有帮助的。跳舞。，無論那一種，亦是很有用的，因爲在　影片之中，不一定用得着跳舞的步伐，但是一個能跳舞的人，他的身段，他的行走，一定是很活潑自然的。身段在影片中，亦佔着一個很重要的地位。隨便什麽導演，他們都承認身段是代表一個人的個性的，亦是和一個人的聲音，同樣的有表演的可能性的。</p>
<p>一個優良的臨時演員，他對於一切游戲，運動等等，無論室内或室外，都應當略諳門俓，雖然不必一定要有深造。攝影塲上每天要用許多鬥紙牌的人，打網球的人，打高而夫的人，騎馬游水的人。即使　了暫時没有用處，這些運動亦可以使你身體　活，腦筋敏捷。</p>
<p>除此之外，一個人在做臨時演員的時候，一定要自已有相當的收入，因爲做臨時演員；工作不見得天天有，收入是極有限的，但是同時除了日常費用之外，你一定還要添置衣物，聘用敎　師等等。做臨時演員，雖然不能當作一種職業，但却等於進一個職業學校，候補做明星。當然你不能希望學校裏來資助你。在十年八年以前做臨時演員，却可以當作一個職業，可以靠此生活。不過做臨時演員的人少，影片的塲面镸镸犬大用人多，演員容易做。不過現在一切都不同了，</p>
<p>你或者以爲那時演員容易做，所以從前的那班臨時演員，現在都做了明星了。那却不然。他們要是不知道學習，現在恐怕臨時演員的地位，都保不住了。所以，學習是不可忽略的。當有聲片剛發明的時候，一切影片都是歌舞片，一般演員除了照常日夜表演之外，還要留下功夫，同時學習談話，唱歌和跳舞。我記得愛麗絲懷德那時白天拍戲、晚上在家裏練習　　舞，唱歌，彈鋼琴，還要背誦明天的對白，往往弄到精疲力謁，欲罷不能。愛麗絲懷德如此，凡是做大明星的，亦都須經過這種階級。不然，他們就天然淘汰下去了。</p>
<p>但是這種辛勤工作的酬報是什麽？勝利，榮名！影戲事業一天存在着，就有千千萬萬的青年男女，爲那種稀世所無的酬報而奮鬥，而犧牲。你怎能怪那二十多個青年男女，逗留在好欺萊塢而不肯去呢？（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評[看護情史]</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>TheWhiteParade丨國泰映</p>
<p>從戲劇題旨，導演手到演員技術方面看來，這［看護情史］都不失爲一張可看的影片日。在　［婦女回到家庭去］的反進步的呼聲中，在一般天眞的少女動搖於［做嬌妻弱媳］抑［投身神聖的社會服務］這予盾中的現在　，我們得强調牠的意義來作爲推荐的。</p>
<p>這兒劇作者ＳouyaLevie與ErnelPagch在表現某看護訓練學校的學生生活中，顯示了一個女性的生存意義，並不在　男性的情懷里，而是在於爲廣大人羣服務的偉大與神聖的事業上。</p>
<p>故事起始於一羣活潑，甚至於是頑皮的少女們進看護女學校去，在管理嚴格與功課　重的生活中，她們感着疲倦，枯燥：同時學識的進步，事業的憧憬與團體的生活，又使她們感着無限的興趣，安慰。</p>
<p>製作者在這兒極細膩，熨貼與深刻地描寫了這羣少女們的各個性格，相互影響，團體活動，私人生活，以及嚴肅的敎師臉孔與頑皮的少女之心靈，相交接下的幽默等，都是生活與忠實的紀錄，也　是利與清新的發掘。</p>
<p>劇情展開來時，由集體的叙寫中側轉入個性的發展。開始就是鬰鬰寡歡的雪旦，竟演了自殺的慘劇。而生性活潑，和善與熱忱的瓊英，則因爲了勸慰雪旦，妄說報紙上載的富少年勞納是她的情人，被另一同學捉弄了而鬧成眞的戀愛。終於在一個男人的熱吻與衆多嬰兒的啼笑，病人的愁容中，由矛盾苦悶，到誠毅地走向爲社會服務，去完成人類至高的任務。</p>
<p>如上的故事是極單简的，由於製作者旁敲側擊，委生動的抒冩，把全片的畫面弄得極活潑，明快，而充份。</p>
<p>導演IrvingCumming最初用莊嚴靜穆的校門來顯隔校内外的情調。清敎徒精神的，瘦削的女監學，與心寬體胖，亦嚴亦慈的女管理：壯嚴的儀式中的燭光，實習室内的靜寂，咖啡座前的歡笑：對病人的小心翼翼，對同伴的嬉笑頑皮·······這些在情緖，氛圍，竹性格等，導演者都用了相當深的功夫，收得較好的效果的。特别在　對比與襯托方面。</p>
<p>但也不是完璧無庇的，在編劇方面雖是避出了一有情人終成眷屬］的俗套的結尾，但中間瓊英　說某人是她的情人，而居然會兩人眞的一見面就相愛了起來，這終究未脫着好萊塢型之愛的演出。在瓊英畢業之後，拒絶勞納之婚約的决定時，勞納已失望地走了，而劇作者再要一個醫生來勸慰她，這也太顯着說敎的痕跡。在導演方面再三出現着管理者嚴肅地背校規的塲合，增加重戲的空氣而換得觀衆的哄笑，却未嘗不是捐失。學校儀式中强調着敎會的禮節，而且一再地演出，這在戲劇效果上說，實在　是　［畫蛇添足］了。</p>
<p>由於(Cagt)的適當，演員們各不着良好的成績。女主角洛麗泰揚那種熱腸慈心的少女情態，是比之［蕩婦回頭］中的演出更得人好感的。出許是因爲這［看護情史］是女人的戲吧？男角約翰鮑爾斯只是平平而已。倒是一瘦一胖的學校當局有了恰到的好處。</p>
<h3>評［地獄的出路］</h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>ＨellＳHighway丨上海</p>
<p>馬文李樂埃的［亡命者］，震動了美國影壇，在這影響之下，雷電華的［地獄的出路］便出現了。雖然我們在這裏可以窺探出商業上的竸爭，可是它以揭發美國牢獄的黑暗爲出發點，正羲感的觀衆們是不嫌這相同的題材之重複使用的。</p>
<p>在戲的開頭，我們便讀了以下的字幕：「爲了揭發現代的中古世紀的黑暗而作」，這一課題的說明，很顯然的作者的企圖，乃是暴露美國法律對於囚徒的虐待，更進一步的代表苦痛的囚徒們向政府要求待遇的改善。我們一次又一次看到看守長和業路工程師對待囚犯們施以慘刑，皮鞭的抽打，關在出汗箱裏面以至於悶死，他們工作疲憊得暉倒，獄卒們却以爲他們懶怠，爲了失了，個湯匙便不給他們飯吃，極重的鐐銬永不離開他們的身體。另一方面，我們也看到看守長在清閒的拉提琴，工程師寫信給機器廠申謝汗箱製作的精巧。在這種種慘酷的待遇之下，於是我們看到囚犯們心中藴藏着極度的憤恨。他們大聲喊叫着：「不給飯吃便不做工」，他們在飯廰中喊着要湯匙，當失去了湯匙，看守長便命令不發湯匙的時候。他們不能再忍受這種慘醋的待遇，他們反抗，他們要拚了性命來奪取自由，於是我們看到那湯匙變成了殺看守長的利刃，他們奪取了獄卒的槍彈，他們有計劃，有組織的逃獄，在紅光滿天的喊聲中，他們的一羣無法無天的暴動起來了。自然，他们的抗爭到底是失敗了，在警察大批的包圍之下，他們是死傷枕枕籍。雖然我們看到他們失敗的悲哀，但是在這血花飛濺中却展開了勝利的前途。</p>
<p>當然，這裏也不是没有缺點的，由於導演没有雄渾的魄力，也由於劇本的結構不够嚴密，使我們學行不够緊張，不够剌戟，至少當我們看過「亡命者」之後，總覺得不够味兒。更主要的是内容方面多少還有非正確表現的地方。主角杜克在影片　是一個英雄。固然劇作者說明他是幾次的入獄，可是並不將他寫成十惡不赦的人。相反的，在慘酷的待遇之下，他自信確有越獄的必要，不過爲了他的弟弟的幸福，他是矛盾的一時中止了英勇的行動。與這一點相關聯的是最後政府大員將工程師逮捕，暗示着政府是有决心改善囚犯待遇的，而祇是獄官獄卒的擅作威福。改善囚徒生活待遇，本來是劇的要求，可惜的是這種希望在藝術家的眼前將必然的變爲泡影，當舊的制度還没有毁滅之前。</p>
<p>到底使我們覺着欣慰的便是劇作者，並没有歪曲結論，到怎樣要不得的程度。英雄杜克雖然背着弟弟自動回獄，並不將他偶然的蒙恩特赦，在鐵栅門中暗示着這一英雄之没落，假使他是完全貼服的話。而另一方面却是奴隸們起來了，囚犯們恥笑英雄杜克背叛同人的利益。在流血大慘劇中，說明今日的奴隷們是不能屈服在非人的待遇中生活下去的。</p>
<p>我們對於這一影片雖然不能十分滿意，但是到底値得人們的注意，在暴露的意義上它是有着較大之成就的了。</p>

<h3>肉餘生（David　Copperfield）（六）</h3>
<p>— 柳村</p>
<p>大衛雖然要想寬慰他自忆，說他所想像的，或者並不是事實，但是他明明看見，愛密柳每次看見司蒂爾福司的時候，眼睛裏就發生異樣的光彩。他看見漢姆的時候，就没有那種光彩，雖然漢姆是她將來的夫婿。所以到了後來，漢姆得到了恶消息的時候，大衛似乎早已得到了預兆了。漢姆將一封信交給了大衛，請他讀給大家聽的時候，他的喉都暗不成聲了。他亦不敢抬頭望那老漁，漢姆，密昔司根密支，和壁各德等人了。他一個字，一個字讀着那封信，上面寫的是：</p>
<p>「你逾份的愛份的愛我了。當你讀到這封信的時候，我已經舍你而遠去了。我將永遠不再回來，除非我已經做了貴婦，和他一同歸來。我辜負了你的盛情，請你們另覓一個可以上答你們摰愛的人，去愛着她。請你祇當我是從小夭折了，掩埋在一個不知所在的地方。並且請你告訴伯伯，我從來没有愛過他，像我現在一半的親切。」</p>
<p>大衛讀完了，那張紙亦從太衛的乎裏飄了下來。漢姆站了起來，似乎要想講什麽話，但是這個時候，大家都看着老漁。他做着一副狂暴可怖的樣子，運聲問着：「那人是誰？我要知道他的名字！那人是誰？「大衛想起了他和他的同學，從前說過的許多話，他就說道：「司蒂爾福司。」老漁聽了，立即掉過頭，走向大門去。他一面走，一面說道：「我去尋覓我的愛密柳去，任他天涯海角。我要去尋她回來。没有人能够阻擋我的。」當然没有人能够阻止他。於是他就出發去開始尋找，走遍了天涯海角，歷盡了歲月風霜。</p>
<p>大衛在老漁出後，亦就無法可想，祇可悄然離開了那昔時聚首歡娱之地，從新回到倫敦。他在倫敦，一個月一個的過去，雖然常爲鴉墨司的一般朋友憂心如搗，但是他自已的生命，已經充滿着重要的事項。他平日著作的志願，現在已經得到了一些報償，因爲他的一篇小說，已被月報登載了出來。但是這個勝利還不算什麽，因爲都拉已經答應了做他的夫人了。他於是立即跑到坎𢖼白雷，去禀告他的姑母貝測，和老師威克菲而，以及尼斯，都拉所給他的快樂。他實在太沉醉於自已的快樂了，他竟没有看出安尼司眼睛裏的幽怨和失望。</p>
<p>可憐的安尼司，自從大衛離開之後，她已是興味索然。他的父親已經將尤利亞喜迫引進了，做了他的事業上的股東。尤利亞對於威克菲而，似乎操縱自如。尤利亞睡在大衛從前睡的房間裏。威克菲而雖然自已說，他的汲引尤利亞，是他自已的志願，但是那句是没有人相信的。不過密考伯亦不能告訴大衛，到底尤利亞有什麽權，可以將威克菲而玩之於掌股之上，以至於使他胆大凶身，竟向威爾菲而要求，將安尼司嫁他妻起來。這才是威克菲爾多年以來，第一次的暴怒，這無知的喜迫，居然想和安尼悮匹配起來。就是尤利亞，卑微的尤利亞，事和後亦明知他做得過份了些。</p>
<p>大衛和都拉結婚之日到了。那時就是威克菲而家人。和威克菲而家中困難之事，大衛亦都一時置之腦後了。都拉，他的嬰兒之妻，是一位空有模樣，百事無能的女子。她連家中日常賬目，都記不清。她旣不懂烹調，更不會治理家務，管理奴僕。不久他的家中，已是綱紀蕩然。大衛書室之中，弄得雜亂無章，但是大衛對於都拉，却是一往情深，恩愛無二。（未完）</p>

<p>流光如駛，一年又這樣迅速的過去了。回首過去一年來上海的建築，雖然世界的經濟恐慌，仍是深刻的嚴重，國内的農村破產後，再遭逢空前的旱荒，愈見其尖鋭化，但上海的建築，仍然是非常的發達，這也許會使人懹疑，其實，在上海，帝國主羲根據地的上海，建築的發達，原是必然的現象，是値不得什麽懷疑的，正因是這樣，愈可促成上海建築的進展和發達，空言勝於雄辨，事實擺在眼前，崇樓大厦的落成，新建廳屋的完工，接連不斷地的出現：我們又可從户口上的觀察，也是天天增加的，姑就上年十一月份的統計人口總數爲三四四六四五二八人，較之同年十月份人口三·四四九·一五四人，增加至一五三七四人，這些不是證明上海的建築發達的原因麽？所以，上海建築的發達，是誰也不會否認的。現在，把八年來的建築總値，列表於下，也可以給我們明白上海的建築情形。</p>
<p>民國十六年　一五二六三五五二兩</p>
<p>民國十七年　三二三五六九八六兩</p>
<p>民國十八年　四五三八六六八二兩</p>
<p>民國十九年　七一五一一八一六兩</p>
<p>民國二十年　六二三五一二五○兩</p>
<p>民國廿一年　三五五四一○○九兩</p>
<p>民國廿二年　七二一七五○○○元</p>
<p>民國廿三年　五五八八○○○○元</p>
<p>在上面表裏，去年的建築總値，只係一月至十月底的共數，而十一月和十二月還未算進呢！倘使把假定十個月的總數來平均計算，那末，十一十二兩個月，當然還有一千一百萬元的可加，雖然相較二十二年是低下了若干價値，但在這裏，我們應該明白，去年建築材料價格的低落，和二十二年相比較，是鐵一般的事實，不但是建築材料，就是一切的物價，也較二十二年份要低落若干呢！所以，去年上海的建築，仍然是發達的。現在，把上海的建築，照現行的行政區域來說，可分爲公共租界，法租界，和市區，我們爲明白各區在去年的建築情形，那末，不得不分說在下面了，其實，這出値得研究的必要呢！</p>
<p>現在首先來述公共租界罷！公共租界在去年十個月裏的建築總額，爲二五·二一二·○○○元，佔全市建築總額百分之五十，本來，上海的建築，公共租界足可代表上海全市的建築。所以，他的建築費，歷年來總在半數以上，這出是環境使然的。在其上年六個月裏，新建築工程。値一千六百二十三萬三千元，佔全市總値百分之四十五，在這裏，中央區佔百分之三十一，滬西區佔百分之三十四，滬東區佔百分之三十，滬北區則祇佔百分之五；和二十二年同一時期内丰比較，减少了百分之十，在這一千六百二十三萬三千元的建築費裏，計發出營造執照二千○十三起，計中央區建築華式住房八八起，西式店面四四起，西式信宅一起，銀行大厦二起，寫字間一起，廠廳一起，汽車間三起：滬東區建築華式廳屋四六○起，西式住宅一起，職員宿舍四起，工廠一二起，紗廠一起，其他廠屋四六起，棧廳六起，寫字間一起；滬西區建築華式住房九三五起，西式店面九三起，西式住宅九七起，公寓二起，職員宿舍四起，工廠三起，其他廠屋三起，學校一起，棧廳三起，汽車間二七起：滬北區建築呢，華式信廳一六四起，西式店面七起，公寓一起，學校一起，汽車間一起，至於拆除造的廳屋，計有華式廳屋七百十三幢，西式廳屋四十五所，七月和八月這兩個月裏的建築價値五百○七萬五千元，其七月份爲二百○七萬九千元，而八月份較好於七月份，爲二百九十九萬六千元，滬西區的建築，佔兩月裏的總値百分之五十强，計華式廳屋一百五十三幢，西式住宅二十六所，旅館一所，學校三起，工廠三處：滬東區，建築華式住宅三百二十六幢，西式店面四十一間，工廠三所，其他工廠廳屋二十三起，棧廳四處；至於中央區建築値，爲六十四萬八千元，滬北區三十二萬五千元，雖然没有建築分類給我們明白，但也可知其建築上的一般了，九月份和十月份的建築，比較二十二年同時期内低落了若干，只三百九十萬五千元，而滬東區佔到大半數呢！計建築華式廳屋二百○六幢，寫字間五起，西式信宅十二宅，工業廠廳十八起：滬西區建築洋廳三十餘宅，中央區佔營造額百分之二十三，滬北區則祇佔百分之七，在這裏，公共租界建築的詳情是明瞭了。而得到結果，就是滬西區和滬東區的建築，是比較中央區來得發達。這因爲中央區地域裏建築物已是遍地，建無可建的情形，我們都是知道的。年以，不得不向東區和西區來建築，東區和西區，已無形中已成了上海的工廠區和住宅區，故其建築物的建築，也是工廠廳屋和住宅居大多數，在上面曾經說過，滬東區和滬西區，去年十個月裏的建築物，便可明白其建築物的趨勢。現在當局交涉的越界築路地方，就是公共租界的滬東區和滬西區，因爲這滬東區和滬西區，比之中央區，正可來得發展餘地，所以去年建築，也在這兩區爲多呢。</p>
<h3>鋼與其保護方法（上）</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>鋼之應用於建築上，由來已久，但其性質之重要與應用之便利，至近數十年來乃愈顯著。約計其優點有五：㈠不著燃燒，㈡無收縮性，㈢材料堅强，㈣不慮蟲蛀，㈤易製各種式樣。普通鋼骨之組織甚多，歷來爲建築家所發明與引用成功者，何止百餘種，而皆不出壓碾鋼型，鋼　，鋼片或鋼條之四種範圍之外。其應用或爲屋頂，或作璧骨，或爲窗框之材料，或供地板之敷設，等等不一而足。近時更有不銹鋼之發明，諸凡廚房，浴室等處，應用甚廣，其發殿似尙方興未艾也。</p>
<p>鋼之一物，其於建築上之地位旣如是之重要，而其應用又如是之廣泛，故我人若欲窮其物理，詳其利用，自非寥寥數語所能兼收而盡藏。此處所述不過爲薄質鋼料，僅包括鋼片與鋼條而方。雖然。此種鋼料實爲近代建築家方悉心研究其應用方法以謀建築之改良，然則我人擇此而論，當非偶然之舉也。</p>
<p>鋼片與鋼條，二者相同之處甚多，所不同者其長短闊狹而已。普通人又往往有一懷疑點，以爲鋼板與鋼片有何分别？關乎此點，我人若徒以其尺寸之厚薄作爲分界，確有令人糢糊之處。依美國之規定，鋼片之厚薄不得過於凖標十號銅線之粗細，大槪在六十四分之九吋以下，而同時鋼板之最薄限度爲十六分之三吋。然則此種規定已確定鋼片與鋼板之分别，而猶有更明晰之區别，卽視其材料之需要性質而異。鋼板之用，大都以其堅强力量與其柔韌性爲重，鋼片則更需要表面之完善，於製法上大有差别。</p>
<p>鋼片與鋼條·須具下列三要素：</p>
<p>㈠建築上之力量</p>
<p>㈡可以接合之性質及方法</p>
<p>㈢耐久性（未完）</p>
<h3>中世紀之建築（下）</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>哥西克式的建築方法並且是變化巧妙，不像羅馬式的這樣呆板，其變化往往因地位，規模，以及其他各種特殊的情形而異。我們看希臘人在雅典建造的愛克羅保列司廟，因欲適合於它的地位的關係，所以它的屋頂就不得不用低平的，可是哥西克式的廟宇，建在聖密區山峯之上的，不僅是依山而立，氣象雄壯，更足以爲山川生色，增自然界的美觀。這就是說人們的心理漸漸地愛那一種有冒險性的，神秘的，奇異的建築形式了。這幾點性質都需要人們勇敢的力量來表現出來，所以我們不必奇怪這哥西克建築方式的發源與進展，却在歐洲的北部，那地方是氣候寒冷，人民都强壯並富有冒險精神的。</p>
<p>哥西克式的興起是非常之迅速，而且某傳　於歐洲全部也是十分廣大，造成建築史上的一頁的不可毁滅的歷史，可是時代不息地進展着，人類的思想不息轉變着，世界的文化也不息地進步推廣着，因此這哥西克式的建築，在此後三百年後，終成爲不可避免的落伍者，它們以前的興盛，至此已不復存在了。其勇敢冒險的特性也被人所抛棄，而同時人們却有另一種觀念和野心在他們生生不息然歴程中滋長起來。</p>
<h3>新式信宅建築和衛生設計（續）</h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>燈光的關係整個身心的健康，比較的更重要，住宅的體積，和支光的配置，每一個工程師應該審愼地研究，過分强烈的烚燈光，會使你的神經剌激過度，强烈的燈光，會使你的神經剌激過度，而發生一種精神上異常的反響，過於暗弱的燈光，會使你的精神意外的消耗。這二種情形都是有礙健康的，牆壁反射作用的配置，在燈光上更屬重要，一切過认興奮的粉飾物，必須儘量避免，淡黄或鵝黄色的粉飾物，已證明有極好的反射作用。</p>
<p>衛生設計上第三個主要問題，是整個住宅的設備問題，便利的水和電的供給，都足以節省信主的精力，而增加不少的安慰。浴室是新式信宅建築上不可缺少的東西，常常看見一座很好的住宅，什麽設備都好，但是缺少日常最需要的浴室，而失去其價値，浴室内的設備不必十分富麗，「容易清潔」是浴室設計的最要問題。</p>
<p>其次適當大小的天井，是新式建築上必具的附件、主人可以利用牠作爲身心的遊息年所，或爲小規模的運動塲，歐美各國的新式住宅内，都設備着小小的草地或泥地的天井，在那裏，家人和孩子可以玩網球、小足球，和其他遊戲，不但可以增加人生的樂趣、並且可以漸漸的把整個家庭分子的體魄鍜練、這種優美的衛生設計，我國的工程師，不妨儘量地採用牠。．</p>
<p>以上所述的幾種不過是最大的幾點，而爲一般建築師所應嚴格注意的啊。</p>
<h3>來函照登</h3>
<p>編輯先生：最近因實業部對於工業技師登記法嚴厲執行以來，非有正式學校畢業證書者，幾難乎其爲技師：尤其對於建築工程方面人才，更感缺乏，於是國内各大學紛紛添設建築科，以應需要。一年來新出現之建築專科晚校，滬上一埠，已有數處之多。其中如圓明園路滬江大學建築專科夜校，及虹口李施德專科學校之建築工程夜校，二處，均尚設備周詳，科程完善，恫聘請國内建築專家業而苦無就學機會之青年，謀前途之光明。然藉之以爲投機事業，虚辭以招徠學生，藉外人以招搖，廣收學費，以誤青年者，亦頗不乏人。最近如江西路發現有某專科學校者，廣發傳單，謂傳授高等建築學科，每週授課祇四小時，而於半所畢業，並大言不慚，以向實業部登記技師爲餌，每月收費至數十元之巨，其欺詐行爲，不言可喻，尚祈吾建築界青年，勿爲所惑，而敎育當局，更應設法取締之也。以上情形，如承賜予刋登，不勝公感，此傾頌撰安。希求上</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng stated that the scope of today's discussions with the Japanese side regarding Sino-Japanese relations concerned the rotation of the special police force in the war zone, and a solution has been decided upon. The affairs in the Ji-Mi area have not been addressed, only the taking over of the Malanyu Eastern Mausoleums. The principles were decided long ago, and today the methods of implementation were discussed. He believes that the takeover can be carried out smoothly in the short term. He himself will return to Beiping tomorrow. (11th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming stated that the important matter discussed today with the Japanese side was the eastern deployment and rotation of the special police force, concerning firearms.

<h3>Increased Inspection of Mail After the Resumption of Postal Services in the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Beiping) News from outside the Pass: After the resumption of postal services in the Northeast, the Postal Bureau of the Japanese Kwantung Government in Shenyang immediately began to establish a postal police network to inspect mail sent from inside the Pass to various places outside the Pass. The Kwantung Government is now also formulating a communication inspection system, and all the necessary expenses for the inspection have been included in the special meeting budget of the Kwantung Government. Furthermore, special postal police training classes have been established in Dalian and Changchun to train specialized personnel for inspecting letters. The Japanese are very strict in inspecting letters from family members of personnel working in various places inside the Pass. In Shenyang, several cases have been discovered where letters with letterhead stationery were deemed by the Japanese to be anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese, and the recipients were arrested.

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Hosts a Banquet for Doihara Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Rumors Circulate That Someone Is Plotting to Assassinate Doihara</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong hosted a banquet at the provincial government yesterday afternoon for Doihara and invited Takahashi, Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, and Tao Shangming to attend. The meeting was very pleasant. The unfinished issues in the war zone were also discussed briefly because the responsible personnel from both China and Japan were currently in Tianjin. It is rumored that he is scheduled to travel south on the 12th to visit Nanjing and Shanghai. This morning, he paid a special visit to Mayor Zhang at the city government. Zhang also hosted a banquet at his private residence last night. (11th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Doihara visited Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e at 11:00 AM on the 11th and spoke for half an hour. Doihara questioned why salt from inside the Pass was not being transported to the Northeast. Zhang explained that it was because the price of salt outside the Pass was too low, and salt from inside the Pass could not be sold. Salt merchants were mostly voluntarily not transporting it, and there were no government prohibitions. At 7:00 PM tonight, Zhang Ting'e invited Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others to accompany him to a banquet for Doihara. Because Yin Tong hosted a banquet for Iga, the seating was delayed until 8:00 PM. (11th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Doihara, who is in Tianjin, is scheduled to take the Jinpu Railway express train tonight to Jinan, transfer to the Jiaoji Railway to Qingdao, stay there for one day, and then return to Jinan to take the Pinghu Railway express train to Shanghai. (11th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) When Major General Doihara arrived in Tianjin from Beiping on the 9th, a strange man was arrested on the train. He was a member of the Communist Party's right-wing suicide squad, claiming to be surnamed Xu, and his purpose was assassination. After a search, a bomb and a pistol loaded with bullets were found in his possession, as well as a photograph of Major General Doihara published in a certain Japanese newspaper. After a serious investigation, it was learned that he planned to assassinate the major general on the train but refused to reveal his accomplices. The culprit was discovered by Guo, the chief of the municipal party department in charge of suppressing the Communist assassination group, and several others, who happened to be on the same train. They immediately coordinated with the military police to arrest the criminal. They did not question him at the time of the discovery but immediately sent him to the Tianjin Station military police. Only later was the above-mentioned fact determined. (11th Day Dentsu Telegram)</p>

Therefore, the implementation of the party's doctrines and the promotion of party affairs must be actively pursued and not neglected. He believed that the first important thing is to recognize the foundation of the party's work in promoting party affairs in various counties and cities, which should start with the counties and cities. The second is how to increase the human and financial resources of the party in each county and coordinate with county administration, so that the party's power can be fully exerted and penetrate the people. The third is to establish the central work of local party affairs, focusing on training the people, enlightening their knowledge, so that everyone embraces the party's doctrines, understands the organization of the government, and accepts the leadership of the party. Only in this way can party affairs be developed and take on the heavy responsibilities of the present. He hoped that all comrades would study together. (11th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its memorial week on the morning of the 11th. Chen Gongbo, Wang Yongbin, Cao Haosen, Chen Xunyong, Chen Jiliang, Lin Xiang, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and over 500 staff members from various departments and committees attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Judicial Yuan President Ju Zheng delivered a report entitled "Sacrificing for Peace." He first stated that the national crisis has lasted for five years. Looking back on the national crisis, we have been subjected to military oppression and economic aggression from the outside, and internal destruction by the Red bandits, as well as water and drought disasters. The amount of material and spiritual losses sacrificed is difficult to estimate. Although the country is still going through difficult times, as long as we do not forget the late Premier's will to "struggle for peace to save China," the current sacrifices may not be future gains. Next, he said that the late Premier's will for peace and struggle is a continuous and hierarchical approach. The late Premier had a kind heart to save China and also realized that the country was weak and the people were poor, and the situation was perilous. He wanted to use the great righteousness of serving the public to influence those who were engaged in militarism and personal welfare, which were contrary to the Three People's Principles, so that they could reform themselves and automatically help the progress of the Three People's Principles. Therefore, there was the advocacy of peace. If they were stubborn and did not repent, then we would use struggle to resist them so that they would not continue to wreak havoc. From this point of view, the two approaches of peace and struggle are continuous and mutually reinforcing, not simply using peace and abandoning struggle. Knowing only peace and not struggle is cowardice. What is the point of revolution? Therefore, working for peace and struggling at the same time is the way to save China. He continued, "We think of today's unprecedented national crisis, where sacrifices are many but gains are few, precisely because we are in the process of sacrificing for peace and struggling for peace. Naturally, there is more suffering than joy. For the sake of sacrificing the present, preparing for the future, this principle of human progress, our future is filled with great brightness. As long as we can work hard and move forward, the whole country is united, thrift in our living, strive for production, and move forward bravely, then the current sacrifices are precisely the future gains. On the contrary, even countries with civilized histories, if they only seek immediate benefits, go their own way, and do not consider the future, only seeking momentary pleasure, their future is also not difficult to imagine." Finally, he said, "Our love of peace is not false, but reasonable, and is built on the foundation of humanitarianism, so even though we endure temporary sacrifices, being invaded and oppressed, we do not submit. Our goal is to rise up and defend ourselves, which is also the goal of our struggle and the great principle of sacrificing the present and preparing for the future. We hope that comrades in the Party and the people of the country will work together to unite within the Party, so that politics and economy can move on the path of progress, resist external aggression and oppression, and seek free, happy, and equal equality. The future gains are sure to be grasped." (11th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Protecting Children and Removing Cruelty - Heng</h3>
<p>丨Feelings Inspired by the Compassionate Children's Society's Request to Sanction Child Abuse丨</p>
<p>Recently, cases of women abusing children have been reported in newspapers from time to time. For example, the case of Zhang Aizhen, a dancer in this city, abusing her six-year-old adopted daughter, Zhang Xiaobao, and the case of Chen Xiangjun, a prostitute in Tianjin, abusing her seven-year-old maid, Lianxi, are the most prominent. These two young girls were not born to Zhang and Chen. It is not surprising that they are abused and played with for personal pleasure. The most shocking thing is the case reported in the newspapers not long ago of a woman with the surname of someone, who superstitiously believed that her own son was fated to be in conflict with her, actually dismembered him and abandoned him in the wilderness. However, this kind of inhumane event is only mentioned in terms of those who are discovered. In fact, there are probably many that are not discovered. After all, the abuse of maids was very common in the old society, and infanticide was even more common in years of famine. There are also occasional reports of deaths due to parents' superstition, so although there are not many such inhumane and cruel acts reported in newspapers, the seriousness of the problem should not be taken lightly. According to yesterday's report, the Compassionate Children's Society has put in considerable effort to protect maids through legislation, and the recent revision of the new criminal law also emphasizes child protection. It can be seen that society has paid considerable attention to these issues. European and American countries have even legislated to protect animals and do not allow them to be abused. How much more so should people not be subjected to cruel treatment and harmed in their physical and mental development? Therefore, the efforts of the Compassionate Children's Society and the vision of the legislative authorities are commendable actions.</p>
<p>However, protecting children through legislation is only a symptomatic treatment. To achieve a fundamental cure, further action seems necessary. The abuse of children is a manifestation of cruelty, and cruelty can be inflicted everywhere. It is not necessary to violate the criminal law before harming children. Therefore, what is needed here is the removal of cruelty. As for infanticide, which is the result of natural disasters, the power of the law is powerless, so there is no need to discuss it in detail. As for those who suffer from superstition, the fundamental solution lies in the popularization of education, which is also self-evident. However, what is the way to remove this cruelty? The answer is to explore the root causes of the formation of cruelty.</p>
<p>In recent years, psychologists have explained many abnormal human psychologies. The most prominent are Sigmund Freud of Austria, Altred Adler, and Carl Jung of Switzerland. According to Freud's view, psychological disorders are mostly due to the suppression of sexual desire, while Jung believes that psychological abnormalities are not limited to the suppression of sexual desire. The suppression of all other desires can lead to selfishness and cruelty. Now, looking at the real cases of Zhang Aizhen and Chen Xiangjun, the cruelty of these two to maids does not seem to be caused by the lack of sexual desire. After all, these two are dancers, so Freud's theory does not seem to apply. Jung's theory is also vague. From the reporter's point of view, Adler's theory is the most able to explain the psychology of these two people. Adler believes that cruelty, prejudice, jealousy, violence, frenzy, love of destruction, schadenfreude, and other psychologies stem from a feeling of inferiority. The feeling of inferiority is caused by the fact that one's position is inferior to others, and one is not valued, resulting in self-pity and resentment, and thinking about ways to take revenge. As a result, cruelty and other eccentric behaviors arise. Adler further said that the reason why this kind of psychology is more common in women than in men is that men still have a better social status than women in today's society. The views of the psychologists who have emerged in England and America are also mostly the same. They all say that all kinds of human desires, which have been obstructed for a long time, and accumulated in the heart, will inevitably lead to mental disorders and eccentricity. Knowing this, the reason why Zhang and Chen abuse maids can be suddenly understood. The background and circumstances of these two must also be unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Since the cause is clear, the way to deal with it is naturally to eliminate the cause. After all, the use of the law has its limits and can only be applied to what has already happened, not to prevent it from happening. Therefore, it can be regarded as a symptomatic treatment, but it cannot be said to be a fundamental cure. From the perspective of the theories of the aforementioned psychologists, the fundamental solution seems to lie in seeking the satisfaction of life's desires in order to restore those with abnormalities to their normal state. However, things in the world are limited, how can everyone be satisfied? Therefore, Adler believes that it is better to cultivate a heart of love for others and for the group through education. This method has considerable value, but it is probably very difficult to achieve quick results. After all, the power of reason and thought to dominate life is often not as great as that of faith and emotion. Therefore, we believe that in these places, there should be a kind of religious-style influence that is in line with modern life to reconcile them. Then, the concept of self can be slightly removed, the psychology of loving others and the group can be enhanced, and unnecessary desires can be slightly suppressed. In this way, these cruel acts and all eccentric, criminal behaviors can be reduced day by day, and the effect will be greater than not educating and punishing them.</p>
<h3>British Government Plans to Change the Organization of the Beijing Consulate</h3>
<p>(London) At today's House of Commons meeting, Conservative MP Davidson asked whether British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson had arrived in Nanjing or Shanghai after arriving in China. Foreign Secretary Simon responded that they were currently discussing changes to the British Consulate General in Nanjing so that the British Ambassador could go to Nanjing as needed. He believed that the changes to the Consulate had not yet been completed. (Eleventh, Reuters)</p>

<p>Japanese Policy, Pacific Crisis Latent</p>
<p>British-American Cooperation to Maintain Peace</p>
<p>Smuts' Remarks Gain American Sympathy</p>
<p>Japan Should Abandon Militarism</p>
<p>Lyttons Speech Resonates</p>
<p>(New York) South African Minister of Justice General Smuts gave a speech on February 9 in the capital of South Africa, discussing the Greater East Asiaism advocated by Japan, advocating that Britain and the United States should establish an agreement to protect Pacific security. According to the New York Times correspondent in Washington, the State Department is extremely satisfied with Smuts' proposal. According to some officials in the State Department, the United Kingdom and the United States have almost implemented cooperation on Far Eastern issues. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States is historically closer than it is now, but it is regrettable that the war debt issue has not been resolved. If the war debt issue is not resolved, the United States will inevitably feel slightly unhappy with the United Kingdom. (Eleventh, Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) Sir Lytton gave a speech in the United States today, saying that if Japan is unwilling to jointly maintain world peace, then the blood shed by millions of people in the previous war would be in vain. The only result obtained from the previous war was that the countries have promised future peace. Lytton advocated that the whole world should ask Japan to recognize this fact and ask it not to give people the bad impression of militarism. Lytton loudly said that unless Japan can calm down and look around the world's current situation and change its policy, the current peace system will inevitably collapse completely. Lytton admitted that Japan's handling of the Manchurian Incident should be given considerable forgiveness in terms of economic relations. Lytton believes that Japan regards Manchuria as a place to release its population and its lifeline. However, the United Kingdom and other countries in the world believe that the signing of the world peace treaty is the lifeline of international peace. Lytton further said that if all countries in the world unanimously ask Japan to join this fair agreement, then I have not seen that Japan can refuse to ignore it. If Japan can truly understand that the benefits of peace far outweigh those of war, then it will be happy to do so. Lytton continued that the League of Nations did not fail in its handling of the Manchurian Incident. The position of the League of Nations is to use criticism as a policy, and it does not use troops to implement its beliefs. Finally, Lytton believes that although Japan can develop Manchuria by peaceful means, the Japanese army must withdraw before it can maintain the goodwill of all countries in the world. (Eleventh, National)</p>
<p>(London) All London newspapers published in a prominent position the speech by South African Minister of Justice General Smuts, calling on the United Kingdom and the United States to cooperate to maintain the integrity of China. Today, Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito publicly condemned Russia's conspiracy in China in a speech at the Chicago Foreign Relations Society, saying that Japan's greatest fear is Russia's aggression. Japan's intervention in Manchuria and its current activities in China aim to reduce Russia's power in these two places. In the past eight years, Moscow has repeatedly sent propagandists, political commissars, and military leaders to China to plan revolutions. Japan cannot ignore this disaster. Japan's only wish for China is that China will be an independent country for a long time. Saito said that some people think that Japan's ambition is to control China. This view is really naive. Saito's words have aroused much comment. His words are obviously in stark contrast to those of General Smuts, who warned the public in Cape Town yesterday that because of Japan's policies, the Pacific is now harboring a huge crisis, and Russia, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom are all at risk of being caught in the whirlpool. All of the United Kingdom's autonomous territories are concerned about their own safety, so they want the United Kingdom and the United States to establish the closest possible cooperation.

<h3>Effective Blow to Japanese Delusions: Anglo-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>Comments from London Newspapers</p>
<p>(London) South African Union's former Prime Minister and current Minister of Justice, General Smuts, delivered a speech in the South African capital last Saturday, advocating for Anglo-American cooperation to safeguard the Pacific region. This morning, newspapers here have commented extensively on this significant speech. The Times stated that Japan's economic, political, and nationalistic ambitions are exacerbating the international situation, causing disturbances even more severe than those in Europe. Under these circumstances, Anglo-American cooperation is of paramount importance to world peace. Both countries adhere to the principles of individual freedom and advocate for the peaceful resolution of international disputes, rejecting war as an instrument of national policy. Given their shared stance, cooperation is essential. The [News Chronicle] stated that [Japan undoubtedly faces its own dangers and difficulties. It would be premature to assume that Japan will never accept sound and sympathetic diplomacy. However, observing recent events, it would be too late to assert that Japan will inevitably embrace sound and sympathetic diplomacy. Japan is currently pursuing a dream of a vast empire. The only effective way to awaken it is through strong Anglo-American cooperation.] The [Daily News] stated that [The whole world must keep a close eye on the rising tides on the Pacific coast. Those devoted to world peace, like General Smuts, should recognize that the most practical way to achieve peace is through direct negotiations, urging Japan to honor its recent pledges. What are these pledges? Namely, Japan's abandonment of the Washington Naval Treaty and its lack of intention to engage in a naval arms race.] (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian commented on General Smuts' speech, expressing strong support, stating that the League of Nations has already achieved significant results. The current priority should be to allow Germany equal status based on universal disarmament, enabling Germany to rejoin the League of Nations. Then, the League of Nations can devise solutions to more serious disputes. Regarding the future of the Pacific, the newspaper advocates for Anglo-American cooperation to maintain peace in the Far East and to gain the support of various Far Eastern countries through peaceful means.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to succeed, and so forth. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>US Alliances with Other Countries Not Permitted by Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Senator Borah's Statement</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Borah responded today to the proposal by South African Minister of Justice General Smuts in Cape Town, stating that the United States cannot enter into any alliances to maintain peace in the Pacific. According to Mr. Smuts, the clouds of war in the Pacific are perilous; therefore, he suggested Anglo-American cooperation for security. Borah criticized, "[General Smuts exaggerates the clouds of war in the Pacific. He suggests forming a military alliance with the United States, according to his own intentions. The United States faces difficulties in forming any alliances with other countries. General Smuts may not understand the public will of the American people, who generally disapprove of such alliances or special understandings. And the United States' foreign policy is ultimately shaped by public opinion.]" (National Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Yamamoto Returns Home to Advise Government</h3>
<p>The Arms Reduction Issue Regains Momentum</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Arms reduction delegate Yamamoto is scheduled to depart from Busan at 11:30 AM today and arrive in Tokyo at 3:30 PM tomorrow afternoon. Upon returning to Tokyo, he will provide significant advice to the government regarding arms reduction. The arms reduction issue, which had been in decline, will regain momentum after Delegate Yamamoto's return. The main points of Rear Admiral Yamamoto's significant advice are approximately as follows: 1) The opinions of the British government and the American representatives regarding Japan's notification of the abrogation of the Washington Treaty and its request for a conference; 2) The future attitude towards establishing arms equality rights; 3) Britain's attitude towards the complete abolition of offensive military forces and the basis of American opposition; 4) Concrete British arms reduction proposals obtained during private meetings with Delegate Nadolny; 5) The difficulties of reopening preliminary talks and convening the main conference, as well as the opinions of Britain and the United States.

It is said that Foreign Minister Hirota is scheduled to meet with Yokotake tomorrow. Foreign Minister Hirota's new policy towards China places particular emphasis on investment in China; therefore, the outcome of Yokotake's report is of particular interest.

<p>Kobe. The Japanese Consulate-General's Commercial Attaché in Shanghai, Heitaro Yokotake, arrived in Kobe at 9:00 PM yesterday aboard the Chichibu Maru to resume his duties. He told reporters that the causes of China's current economic difficulties lie in the increase in foreign payments. The only way to overcome this difficulty is through loans. It seems to be a fact that China is expecting economic assistance from Japan. Shanghai is currently facing financial pressure. He believes that without self-reliance, economic recovery cannot be achieved. However, there is a need to consider emergency measures. He hopes for large-scale assistance to China. Recently, Sino-Japanese relations have returned to normalcy, which is gratifying. (Dentsu News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Commercial Attaché Yokotake, who was summoned to return to China, spoke to reporters on the train, scheduled to arrive in Tokyo at 9:30 PM tonight, as follows:</p>
<p>The concrete measures for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation must first involve importing Japan's excellent technology into China, thereby improving the cultivation of Chinese cotton, wheat, rice, etc. If the import of expensive foreign goods is reduced and cheap and excellent Japanese goods are purchased, then Chinese trade can recover within a few years. The most important issue is loans. As a result, seven things will be considered, such as setting up loans. There are rumors that the National Government will adopt the gold standard and reduce parity, but the former is entirely out of the question, because silver is difficult to nationalize, then the latter is also hopeless. (Dentsu News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Commercial Attaché Yokotake in Shanghai advocates for increasing Sino-Japanese trade and sending agricultural and industrial experts to China to increase China's purchasing power. He concluded that Japan should be a major customer for Chinese cotton, and China is indeed a large market for Japanese goods. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>A Thousand Puppet Police Defect</h3>
<p>Angered by Japanese Brutality, Join the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to reliable sources, on the 5th of this month, a Japanese security commander in the puppet government of Huadian County, Jilin Province, had an argument with a puppet policeman. He then drew his sword and severed one arm of the Chinese puppet policeman, causing public outrage among the puppet police force. Approximately one thousand puppet police officers from the first brigade of the county immediately defected, killing the Japanese instructor, the county advisor (Japanese), and more than ten other Japanese puppet officials. Later, they planned to attack the city of Antu County, attempting to kill the enemy, and gathered at the border between Huadian and Antu counties. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army was panicked and heavily guarded. The puppet police joined forces with the volunteer army and entrenched themselves at the county border, with a strong presence. (Hua Lian Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Kwantung Army Establishes New Advisory Department</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) After abolishing the Special Affairs Department, the Kwantung Army has decided to establish a new Advisory Department at the Headquarters to enhance the function of developing Manchurian industries and assisting the military commander. Currently, the Army Central Department and the Kwantung Army Headquarters are considering the selection of six advisors. It is said that the Advisory Department will have six departments: legal system, finance, banking, industry, transportation, and forestry. (Nippon Dempo News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Installations in Kamchatka</h3>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency Osaka Correspondence. According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, the Soviet Union has recently been taking strict precautions on the coast of Kamchatka, and has already installed various military facilities. Foreign sailors are not allowed to land in the Dzhigastry Bay area. A naval base is being built in Avachinskaya Bay, and an army airfield is being built in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Eight submarines are stationed in Dzhigastry Bay, which belong to the Soviet Navy's Independent Far East Fleet. There is also a heavy artillery unit stationed on the coast of the bay.</p>
<h3>US-Russia Trade Stagnation Does Not Affect Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>(Washington) The current tense situation between the United States and Russia is only a transitional phenomenon. Ultimately, there will be a more practical solution to resolve the disputes between the two countries. This is the opinion expressed to the Associated Press reporter today by a general neutral diplomatic observer. The crux of the difficulty lies in trying to solve financial and commercial problems at the same time. The general opinion of observers is that US-Russian diplomatic relations, like French-Russian and British-Russian diplomatic relations, must undergo a long period of evolution. Furthermore, the recent stagnation of trade between the two countries reminds people of the dream of President Roosevelt after recognizing Soviet Russia, hoping for tens of millions of dollars in trade with Russia. In fact, in 1934, the United States' trade with Russia was only worth $14,866,000, and the year before it was $8,743,000. These figures are enough to prove the extent to which Americans hope to realize their dreams. However, the importance of this matter lies in its possible impact on the Far East. In other words, it is clearly unlikely that the United States and Russia will jointly deal with Japan. All of this has dispelled the predictions of the general public in 1934. Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared today that the expression of sympathy between the United States and the Soviet Union, or the ability to change a certain policy towards Japan, is not very relevant in the current stagnation. Regarding the reduction of staff at the Soviet Union's US embassy and the withdrawal of consulates, Borah said that this move would not have a serious impact and is purely an economic issue that should not be seen as having any other purpose. (National Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Judging from the phenomenon, Secretary of State Hull is currently conducting negotiations on reciprocal trade agreements, and there will soon be facts to show it. Hull has felt in recent days that the United States should show other governments that while the United States is a friendly and good neighbor, it is not a country to be bullied. The United States' withdrawal of the consulate in Ynsk and the reduction of staff at the Soviet Union's US embassy are expressions of this attitude. It is said that Hull firmly believes that if the United States does not provide Soviet Russia with cash loans, then Soviet Russia will refuse to repay its debts to the United States. The cash loan that Soviet Russia intends to borrow is 100 million US dollars.</p>
<p>If it can be achieved, Soviet Russia will naturally take advantage of this atmosphere to conduct loans to European countries, and then blackmail the United States to obtain preferential loan conditions. Hull saw through Soviet Russia's attitude, so today, after a five-minute meeting between Hull and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Troyanovsky, he cut off negotiations. Afterwards, Hull declared that he did not hope to trade much with Soviet Russia, at least not without financial assistance from the US government. (National Press Agency Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>French Radio Station Completed</h3>
<p>US-French Telegraph Communications Can Reach Directly</p>
<p>Saint-Nazaire, France. According to the Morning Post, France's most powerful radio station has been completed and will begin service on the 15th of this month. In the future, wireless telegraphs sent from France to ships sailing in the Atlantic can be received directly, and wireless communications between France and the United States will no longer need to be relayed through the United Kingdom. The main power station is located near Ceffelac and has three iron frames, each 100 meters high. Each frame has an electrical voltage of 10,000 volts. The radio station employs a total of 100 people, but only one person is needed to send and receive telegraphs. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Radio Transmits Images and Sounds</h3>
<p>Watching and Listening to Speeches While Sitting in a Small Room</p>
<p>Successful Experiment in Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>A Major Revolution in Telephone Communications</p>
<p>)Berlin (The popularization of wireless film machines has now taken another step forward. Scientists in Berlin have created a perfect machine that can use the cathode rays of electric current to directly capture people and broadcast them. Whenever individual speeches are given in public gathering places, if the scenery is not too complicated, it can be captured and transmitted by this machine. Before this machine was invented, the transmission of wireless images required first capturing the scenery into a sound film, and then broadcasting it in separate parts. Wireless film broadcasting agencies in Berlin have been established for more than a year, and their economic support is limited to the manufacturers of receiving machines. They are also conducting various observational experiments at the same time. However, the newly invented machine is much simpler, and the number of people who purchase receiving machines in the future will inevitably increase greatly. Image and sound reception can be installed in one machine, and public speeches can be watched and listened to quietly in individual homes. Furthermore, the installation of fax machines on telephones is technically possible today, but the cost is too high and it is difficult to popularize. In the future, the national wireless film and broadcasting industry may undergo a major revolution due to the use of wires for transmission. After the use of wires to transmit scenery becomes popular, the first to benefit will be ordinary telephone communications. This type of wire was tested yesterday by Dr. Banhuezer of the German Post Office at the German Scientific Society. This was the first practical test in the world. The installation of the wire has been completed today. One end is connected to the central office of the Post Office, and the other end is connected to the wireless film transmission machine in Weizleben. It can transmit 1.2 million electrical vibrations per second, allowing ordinary news photos to have a clear outline without any light or complex dynamics. As for ordinary telephone lines, they cannot yet be used to transmit scenery at the same time, but the wires that have been successfully tested can also be used as telephone lines for transmitting sound. Therefore, it is predicted that when wireless film becomes popular in the future, the wires in all parts of the world will be replaced with new types of wires for transmitting sound and images.

<p>Italy Mobilizes Two Army Divisions, Darkening War Clouds</p>
<p>(Rome) The border dispute between Italy and Ethiopia has intensified again. An official statement declared that [Ethiopian troops are constantly concentrating near Walwal, putting pressure on Italian troops. Recently, a group of Ethiopian soldiers attacked an Italian defense force in Afdub, resulting in mutual fire. Five Italian soldiers were killed and six were injured. The Ethiopian side suffered more casualties. The Italian embassy in Addis Ababa has been ordered to lodge a formal protest.] (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy today drafted three companies of reservists due to the risk of war on the Ethiopian border. Ethiopian troops attacked Italian indigenous troops stationed south of Walwal in Italian Somaliland in the early morning of January 29th. Five Italian regular soldiers were killed and six were injured. Many Ethiopians participating in the conflict were also killed. Diplomats have been instructed to notify Ethiopian officials that Italy has suffered greatly from this kind of harassment by unofficial troops. If the Ethiopian government cannot effectively prohibit it, the Italian government will take self-defense actions. According to the official report of the incident, the government only received it today, but the above-mentioned actions have been carried out immediately. It is said that attacks similar to this one have occurred frequently recently. Details of this incident are not yet known, but it is said that the number of Ethiopian casualties in the attack was higher than that of the Italian soldiers, and they were repulsed. It is currently difficult to predict what actions the Italian government intends to take in addition to protesting to Ethiopia. However, if military action is necessary, Italy will be able to immediately deploy troops trained with modern weapons to the Ethiopian border. (National Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the second clash between Italian and Ethiopian troops, Italy has mobilized two reserve divisions to prepare for reinforcement. According to a semi-official statement from the Stefani News Agency, the Italian government mobilized two reserve divisions on the 5th and 11th of this month to prevent any incident: the Berolitan Division, the 29th Division of the Province of Messina, and the Guvenaina Division, the 19th Division of the Province of Florence. Those mobilized were soldiers of the 1911 class, that is, adult soldiers born in 1911. The mobilization was quite successful. In addition, news about the Ethiopian border incident on January 29 has been issued in an official statement and published in today's newspapers to inform the public. However, the newspapers did not comment on it. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Since Italy officially announced the mobilization of two army divisions today, the clouds of war have suddenly become heavy. According to sources in official circles here, unless the Italian government receives a satisfactory reply, the Italian government will issue an ultimatum to the Ethiopian government. A spokesperson for the Italian government told a reporter from the National Press Agency that the Italian government had been waiting patiently for the Ethiopian government to control the situation, but such unfortunate events still occurred, which made the Italian government unbearable. The spokesperson continued that the Ethiopian government cannot fabricate facts to deceive the world. According to general observations, the Italian government will not issue a formal declaration of war against Ethiopia. The actions of the Italian government will likely follow Japan's methods in Manchuria and Britain's methods towards Sudan, punishing Ethiopia with military force, as Italy claims that its actions are out of self-defense against Ethiopian attacks. (National Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) An Italian Foreign Ministry spokesperson told a Reuters interviewer today that if relations between Italy and Ethiopia continue to change and become more tense than they are now, the Italian government may send a memorandum to the Ethiopian government. It is said that the currently mobilized army is a precautionary plan and will not leave Italy unless the situation becomes more serious. It is said that there are as many as 30,000 Ethiopian troops gathered at various points on the border. There are rumors outside that Italy is determined to invade Ethiopia, but judging from the current situation, it seems difficult to achieve, because Ethiopia has heavy rainfall every year from March to November, making it extremely difficult to march there.

<h3>Italian Public Opinion Is Exceptionally Excited</h3>
<p>(Rome) The clash between Italian and Ethiopian troops at Walwal on January 29 has greatly aroused Italian public opinion. The Italian government has mobilized two army divisions for preparedness, and reservists of the 1911 class who completed their training two years ago have also been called into service. It is said that this army will be concentrated in Bari and Florence. At the same time, there are rallies and parades throughout Italy to express indignation. One of the most prominent was in Milan, where students and unemployed people marched through the city, shouting [Down with the Ethiopians] [Long Live Mussolini]. The demonstrators all waved national flags and shouted war slogans. Although the number of people was large, they were orderly, so the police did not interfere.

<h3>Calls for a British Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Poor Handling of Unemployment Issues</p>
<p>The Labour Party Prepares to Propose an Impeachment Case</p>
<p>The Conservative Party Has Lost Its Ability to Manipulate</p>
<p>Wants to Recruit George into the Cabinet to Bolster Itself</p>
<p>)London (Labour Party leader Lansbury told a Reuters interviewer today that the British political situation will change. The opposition party will ask Parliament in the middle of next week to allow it to propose an impeachment case against the government for its ineffective handling of the unemployment problem. He hopes that the impeachment case can be debated on Thursday, and the time should be more than one day. The Labour Party does not want to allow the time of this session of Parliament to be completely devoted to the government's and its own members' discussion of the Indian issue. The people's livelihood situation in this country needs to be remedied urgently, and Parliament must be given time to discuss remedial measures. The Labour Party will request the establishment of a special Cabinet committee to deal with the difficult problems of national transformation. (Reuters Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>)London (The events of last week in Britain have greatly disadvantaged the government's future, and there are rumors in Parliament that events will occur again this week. The government party acknowledges that the breakdown of the unemployment benefit agency has given the opposition party the most powerful tool. Even those who support the government are now severely criticizing the unemployment financial conference for not having enough time to implement relief work, and say that the government's calculations were obviously wrong. At the same time, there are actions within the Conservative Party to oppose the current government. The number of those who criticize unemployment payments is very large, at least equal to the number of socialists. Observers who sympathize with the government are mostly concerned about the government's current instability, saying that the Conservative Party has lost its ability to manipulate. Although they are willing to support the government's Indian policy, they all have the feeling that the Conservative Party has lost its effectiveness. There are now people who advocate recruiting Lloyd George into the cabinet, and there are also those who advocate that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain should find a way to reconcile with the enemy party. At the same time, many people are demanding an immediate cabinet reshuffle, which should not be delayed until the autumn, in order to counter the advantage gained by the Labour Party last week. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The [Paris Echo] published a London dispatch, describing the rumor that Free Party leader Louis George would join the British Cabinet in a reshuffle. It is said that [Once Louis George joins the Cabinet, it will be difficult to coexist with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Simon. Recently, the Manchester Guardian revealed that the government had twice signaled to Simon, implying that he resign from the position of Foreign Secretary and transfer to other important positions, such as the Governor-General of India or in one of the two ministries of Justice and Internal Affairs, but this was rejected by Simon. Because of the two factions competing for the parliamentary vacancy election in the Huawilde area of ​​Lancashire County a few days ago, the Labour Party candidate was elected, so the position of the current government and the Conservative Party was quite shaken, and Louis George's prestige has always been remarkable, and his magic power to attract the masses has not diminished in the past. It is not surprising that the government wants to recruit Zheng into the cabinet to consolidate itself. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Life of the Current French Cabinet May Not Be Long</h3>
<p>(Paris) Although the Flandin government has achieved success in the diplomatic field since taking office, many in Congress say that its fate is not long. Now, those who oppose the government are not only the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, but even the Radical Socialist Party, which the government relies on as its mainstay, is expressing dissatisfaction. Since the London meeting, Hélério's control over his party members has been greatly reduced. After slightly observing this situation, Pleskin believes that Laval seems to be the most likely successor to Flandin. However, at present, it is feared that Lai will not replace Fu. As for Helio, who is now trying to support Flandin, he will not personally come forward. Although Darada is still ambitious, the tragedy of last February still leaves an unpleasant feeling, so even people in his own party expect that he will not be able to come out again. However, some newspapers speculate whether Fu will take the means of dissolving the House of Representatives. (National Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Russia-Romania Rail Through Traffic to Begin on August 1st</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union and Romania railway representatives have successfully concluded discussions on through traffic issues. Comrade Gilshanov, Director of the International Transportation Bureau of the People's Commissariat of Transportation, presided over the meeting. According to Comrade Gilshanov's statement to the TASS reporter, the agreement on through traffic for Soviet-Romanian passenger and freight trains is economically important, as it will not only develop transportation between the Soviet Union and Romania but also facilitate transportation between other countries via the Soviet Union and Romania. This agreement allows Soviet passenger and freight traffic to have a shortcut when heading south to Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Yugoslavia, Austria, Italy, and southern France. At the same time, European passenger and freight can reach Persia and Afghanistan via a shorter route. The Soviet-Romanian through traffic will be implemented from August 1st after the railway bridge over the Dnieper River at Boraspol is repaired. The aforementioned meeting also had a special understanding on the bridge repair. (Tenth TASS dispatch)</p>
<h3>Poland Develops Trade</h3>
<p>Polish Exhibition Ship to Arrive in China in April</p>
<p>[Warsaw Correspondence] Poland's foreign trade saw considerable progress last year. According to precise statistics, from January to October of last year, the largest buyer of Polish goods was the United Kingdom, accounting for 24%, followed by Germany at 19%. Purchases of Polish goods by other countries such as Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and Italy also increased significantly compared to 1933. In terms of overseas trade, the largest buyer was the United States, followed by Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, and others. It is also worth noting that Poland's overseas trade developed extensively last year. In 1933, almost all Polish goods were sold in European countries, accounting for 92.5%, while overseas trade only accounted for 7.5%. However, last year, shipments to Europe fell to 88.3%, and further to 80.3% in September, meaning that overseas trade accounted for 18.7% of the total in that month. Therefore, Poland's future business plan focuses on promoting overseas trade as much as possible while striving to improve Polish-British business relations. Trade between China and Poland also progressed last year, with Polish goods sold to China totaling approximately 2.1 million Customs Gold Units and Chinese goods sold to Poland totaling approximately 1.1 million Customs Gold Units. This is due to the success of the direct shipping route from Shanghai to Gdynia, Poland, with a special ship departing every three weeks. Furthermore, to promote the sale of Polish goods in China, the Dadalos exhibition ship plans to sail from Gdynia to Shanghai for a public exhibition, expected to arrive in Shanghai around April 20th, fully loaded with various Polish products.</p>

<h3>US Chief of Staff Requests Funds to Modernize Army Equipment</h3>
<p>Washington: Chief of Staff General MacArthur today requested an increase of 50,000 active-duty soldiers and 2,000 officers. General MacArthur also stated that the government will allocate $405,000,000 to increase the army's equipment and build 880 military aircraft. The government has repeatedly stated that its major plan is to strengthen the nation's defense projects, and what is being said now is merely a reaffirmation of previous statements. Although General MacArthur's request is not included in the budget, it does stipulate $900,000,000 in military expenses for the navy and army, to be used for building new ships, 1,000 aircraft, strengthening coastal defenses, and partially modernizing the army. In addition to recommending $11,000,000 for the Hawaiian Army Air Base, the Budget Committee is also studying plans to establish important bases in Panama and Alaska. (Tenth National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Conflict between Japan and Mongolia at the Halaha Temple (Harbin Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Triangular Area is a Military Stronghold</p>
<p>Both Japanese and Mongolian Sides Were Prepared</p>
<p>However, This Time It May Be Resolved Peacefully</p>
<p>The Halaha River flows into the southeastern corner of Lake Buir, and the Ulshun River connects Lake Hulun and Lake Buir. Another small river, called the Chaliz River, connects the above two rivers. The triangular area between the three rivers and Lake Buir is the territory belonging to the Halaha Temple. This area has been the focus of Japanese attention since the September 18th Incident, considering it not only a fortress between [Manchukuo] and Mongolia but also of great significance in Japanese-Soviet military relations. Therefore, Mongolian soldiers trained by the Japanese are stationed at the Ganzhu Temple. The Halaha Temple incident occurred in mid-January when Japanese military instructor Major Hontani led more than ten soldiers and encountered an Outer Mongolian scout team. As a result of the conflict, several Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. On January 30th, the Japanese side dispatched a large team of soldiers from Hailar to seize the Halaha Temple. According to the Japanese side's claims and the puppet regime's propaganda, the Halaha Temple should belong to [Manchukuo] and is definitely not Outer Mongolian territory, so the Mongolian army should not forcibly enter the territory. They claim that they will not advance any further once they have driven the Mongolian army out of the territory.</p>
<p>However, news from Kulun, such as the statement issued by the Outer Mongolian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Genden, stated that [the Halaha Temple and its surrounding area have belonged to Mongolian territory since ancient times and have never been under the jurisdiction of Hulunbuir. Therefore, the Outer Mongolian Republic can never agree to the occupation of the Halaha Temple by Japanese-[Manchukuo] troops and recognizes the illegal invasion of the national border by the Japanese-[Manchukuo] armies. After the Halaha Temple incident on January 24th, there was calm for several days until 8:00 AM on January 31st when the border guard team near Lake Buir discovered a unit of the Japanese-[Manchukuo] army, consisting of several military vehicles and fifty soldiers and cavalry in echelon formation, crossing the Outer Mongolian border from [Manchukuo] territory. The unit occupied Kor Obor and continued to advance into Mongolian territory. However, the Outer Mongolian border guard army, unwilling to engage in armed conflict, retreated slightly, demonstrating a calm attitude. To avoid conflict, they did not fire a single shot. They are now only building defensive positions on the shore of Lake Noring. The Outer Mongolian government, for the sake of its national rights and the restoration of peace, has forbidden the border guard army to open fire without authorization and will not hesitate to engage in peaceful negotiations in the future.]</p>
<p>Judging from the above statement, it seems that this matter will not escalate much. However, the Japanese troops stationed along the Middle East line are elite units from Kyoto, Nagoya, Hiroshima, and other places. Although the exact number cannot be determined, military observers believe that there are at least two and a half divisions, with a total of more than 30,000 soldiers. Therefore, it is very possible that this incident will escalate dramatically. Moreover, those young officers all want to test their skills and see who is superior to the Red Army. The other side is also quite clear about this situation and will naturally not relax their grip. They have newly mobilized five divisions of troops in the Far East, with the main units concentrated along the western border of [Manchuria].</p>
<p>Outer Mongolian troops in Kulun consist of mixed teams of cavalry, artillery, and machine guns, totaling approximately 20,000 soldiers, ten cannons, eight anti-aircraft guns, twenty-one bomber aircraft, and twenty-five reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, an army university, officer school, and scientific arms factory have been established in the Kulun area. With such defensive power in that vast and boundless plain, it is feared that it will not be easy for foreign forces to invade.</p>
<p>On the left bank of the Kherlen River, in the territory of the Chechen Khan, a large airfield has been built, hiding more than 30 bombers. In the Hentiy area, there are also 500 cavalry, an artillery team, a machine gun team, six tanks, and several military vehicles. West of the Halaha Temple, along the upper reaches of the Ulshun River, cavalry scouts frequently patrol back and forth, and automobiles often speed by, carrying out special liaison missions. In the Ikh Bulag Temple southwest of Lake Buir, there is also a regiment of infantry and a brigade of cavalry, providing considerable security. Therefore, even if the Japanese army has some ulterior motives and wants to take advantage of the situation to break in, they dare not truly engage in a head-on confrontation with the well-prepared Outer Mongolia. They will probably take advantage of Outer Mongolia's statement of peace and change course, perhaps even engaging in negotiations. (February 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Build Pier in Shantou</h3>
<p>As a Base for the Fleet and Smuggling</p>
<p>The Site Extends More Than Ten Zhang Into the Sea</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese Navy rotates its patrols of the southern coast of China every season. Its fleet sails from the strategic port of Magong in Taiwan, heading directly to Shanghai, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, or even Guangzhou, and occasionally to Hainan Island. Every island, mountain, port, and stone on the southern coast of China, its depth, and the time and strength of the tides are thoroughly understood. The tonnage of Japanese merchant ships sailing in South China almost surpasses that of British and Norwegian merchant ships. Japanese ships arriving in Shantou have always docked on the Qilu sea, that is, the Shen Zhao Road end in front of the Japanese Consulate. The Japanese Consulate is the most magnificent building among the consulates of various countries in Shantou, with a police station and prison inside. The consulate is located in the center of the city, about 300 steps in front of the Eastern District Office, and faces the Eastern District Office across the street. Japanese warships berth at Qilu almost every day, with a rotation of garrison personnel. Officers and soldiers disembark using small motorboats or sampans, landing in the fields at the end of Shen Zhao Road near the consulate. All secret transportation activities take place here. Nearby is the Datong Ice Factory, opened by Taiwanese people, which occupies a large area. Many Japanese and Taiwanese people are concentrated here. Further ahead are the Dongying School, Boai Hospital, and Japanese Elementary School, each occupying several acres of land and capable of being used for gatherings and garrisoning troops. In particular, the Japanese Elementary School across from the Municipal Government is unusually sturdy, resembling a military camp. There are observation posts and various facilities on the corners of the building, which can communicate with ships through flag signals and lights. The number of Japanese residents scattered around Qilu has increased sharply in recent years, numbering no less than four or five hundred, but there has never been a thorough investigation, because most of the businesses they operate are of a mobile nature.</p>
<p>Last year, Japanese consular officials stationed in South China were summoned by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Taiwan to hold a conference on the other side of the strait. Developing Japanese commerce in Shantou was also an important issue at the conference. Long ago, they had been considering building a pier at a suitable location along the coast to dump Japanese goods in the Chaoshan region, to facilitate the docking of merchant ships and warships and the transportation of heavy machinery and goods. Because the barge workers of the Shantou sea had been united in refusing to load and unload passengers and cargo for Japanese ships. After the Shanghai Incident of the previous year, the arrogance of Japanese residents increased, and small motorboats and barges with the Japanese flag were able to operate freely. The workers' union disintegrated invisibly, and Japanese goods were able to flow smoothly into the Chaoshan market and be sold in various counties. Initially, Taiwanese people contracted for transportation, but recently there have been many conflicts with the tax bureau's inspectors. For example, in the case of seafood, in addition to paying customs duties as required, it is also necessary to pay the seafood Kyoto donation, but Taiwanese people refuse to pay, resulting in incidents of assaulting inspectors and police chiefs. The local authorities here have adopted a policy of appeasement, and each case has been compromised, which is regrettable. The momentum of Japanese residents in Shantou is such that the pier they urgently need has now been built.</p>
<p>The Haitan at the mouth of Commercial Street was originally owned by the Commercial School and the Gospel Hospital, with undisputed ownership. However, five years ago, a Japanese national named Luo Bingzhang suddenly had a dispute over management with the Commercial School. This case remains unresolved to this day. It is said that Luo was acting on Japanese instructions, initiating the plan to build a pier. Today, Japanese people are again occupying land on Shen Zhao Road to build a pier, extending more than ten zhang beyond the Haitan into the sea, and the Datong Ice Factory is building it on the surface. They did not report to the Municipal Government beforehand, clearly intending to infringe on our territorial sovereignty and violating the regulations of the Municipal Government. The Public Security Bureau, based on a report from the Oka police, has lodged representations with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>An investigation into the actions of the Japanese in Shantou has recently attracted great attention from the authorities. For example, the Japanese previously established a Sun Dance Hall on Yushen Street, attracting people with weak wills to spy on the secrets of various agencies in the city. They also formed the Dongjiao Society, using so-called friendly language to recruit laborers, porters, boatmen, shops, and vendors from the lower classes. Each person paid a small membership fee each month. All members could use external influence to abuse their authority and resist tax collectors and inspectors, as well as avoid taxes. Initially, it was quite popular, but after the authorities paid attention to prevention, they used a different approach, operating secretly. The most obvious thing is the smuggling electric boats along the coast. Last year, the Chaozhou Customs had repeatedly seized them, but the electric boats ignored everything and even took the customs officers to Taiwan for business negotiations. We made representations, but to no effect. The next is the smuggling of goods, not paying taxes, contracting to transport them to Chaozhou and Jieyang counties in the interior for sale, and establishing warehouses. If the inspectors detained the goods, they would form an assault team to deal with them. Previously, the National Salvation Association intercepted a small boat carrying seafood and shark fins on the Wuchiao River and detained the people and goods at the National Salvation Association. The assault team even gathered from a factory in Wuchiao, carrying weapons and pistols, and made a big scene at the National Salvation Association, taking away the goods and people. Such major cases are also unresolved, so the power of the assault team has increased day by day, and the inspectors and tax collectors are no match for them. As a result, there is more and more smuggling, and at the same time, Chaozhou and Shantou taxes are very heavy, making it impossible for legitimate merchants to compete with smuggled goods, creating opportunities for smugglers. Moreover, their smuggled goods are mostly transported to the Datong Ice Factory at the end of Shen Zhao Road at night for wholesale storage, and the inspectors do not intervene. This is another reason for the forced construction of the pier. (7th)</p>
<h3>Commercial Depression in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Most Bankruptcies in the Silver and Money Industry</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since last spring, the commercial sector in Tianjin has experienced abnormal development, with a world of difference between the business conditions of stores in the concessions and those outside the concessions. The major department stores have either moved into the concessions or reduced their scope and established branches in the concessions. The once most prosperous Dongmalu, Beidaguan, and Houjiahou streets have almost no second- or third-class stores left, except for a few sixth- or seventh-class stores. Houjiahou's used clothing street, the concentration area of large stores, became desolate after last spring, with each store seeing few customers and hardly any customers all day long. Those stores with more than 200 years of history, which used to maintain their facade with wholesale dealers, were also directly affected by the extreme economic hardship and commercial depression in the outer counties and towns. Zhugang Alley, the main area for cotton yarn, was also unable to support itself due to the influence of cotton yarn dealers in the concessions. From the Jintang Bridge north to the new train station on Dajing Road, a street five miles long, there are no large stores. Those with slightly thicker capital have all moved into the concessions. In and around the past year, each store has prominently displayed reduced prices for clearance sales, or directly wrote [Year-end Sale at Cost], even pharmacies have used discounts of 20% or 12.5% to attract customers, but the effect of attracting customers is still very small. Therefore, many stores have closed down, especially in the silver and money industry, where many were unable to recover loans on time, causing a lot of trouble, and more went bankrupt. Stores in the concessions seem to be prosperous on the surface, but in fact, due to the heavy taxes, they often cannot make ends meet. Each store has no choice but to embrace the principle of small profits, selling outwards as long as they do not lose money. Therefore, although each store is crowded with customers, in reality, they are all strong on the outside but empty on the inside, and their plight is no less than that of those outside the concessions. Among the British, French, Italian, and Japanese concessions in Tianjin, the more prosperous ones are the Lixian in the French concession and Route 26, as well as the Asahi Street in the Japanese concession. However, the Japanese concession has repeatedly experienced disturbances, and due to the unstable situation in North China, those with any status are wary and hesitant to move forward, so the stores have also been affected. The stores in the French concession's Lixian are all located at the junction of Han and Japanese, and have become the commercial center of the whole Tianjin port. According to a survey by the Social Affairs Bureau, there were about 32,000 stores with a business tax of 14th grade or above outside the concessions in the year before last. Last year, the number of bankruptcies followed one after another, and now there are only more than 21,000 left. The number of stores in the concessions is also estimated to be more than 20,000. Although there have been continuous increases last year, most of them moved from Chinese streets, and there are not many newly opened ones. Although the period for the year-end closing of accounts has passed, it cannot yet be regarded as without any changes. It is feared that after the Lantern Festival, there will still be stores closing down inside and outside the concessions. (7th)</p>
<h3>8th Division Recovers Bandit Area of Ning Le</h3>
<p>Captures Pseudo-Central Committee Member Lou Mengxia, etc.</p>
<p>And Seizes Over 600 Long and Short Guns</p>
<p>Gan News: Since being ordered to suppress the remaining bandits between Ningdu and Lean, the 8th Division has spared no effort. Bandit nests in Luokou, Zhangguan, Xiaotian of Ningdu, and Yinshui, Dajinzhu, Zhongcun, etc. of Lean have all been successively recovered. Approximately 3,000-4,000 gun-wielding bandits, including the two independent regiments under the jurisdiction of the pseudo-Jiangxi Military Region, independent battalions of various counties, guerrilla units, advance teams, the pseudo-Jiangxi Provincial Government Guards, and the pseudo-Security Bureau, have been wiped out. In particular, in a battle near Zhongcun, the Liu Zhenshe Regiment of the 8th Division's Li Ying Brigade was especially valiant. In addition to killing many bandits on the spot, it successively captured pseudo-Central Executive Committee member and concurrently Director of the Jiangxi Security Bureau, Lou Mengxia (pseudo-Executive Minister Huo Tongguang committed suicide and his head has been severed), pseudo-Jiangxi Provincial Committee member Xiahou Yong, pseudo-Military Region Sabotage Minister Luo Chunmei, and more than 800 male and female bandits. They seized more than 500 rifles, 18 heavy machine guns, more than 20 submachine guns, more than 30 Mauser pistols, one silver seal of the pseudo-Jiangxi Provincial Government, manufacturing machines, lithographic printing machines, and multiple sewing machines. The remaining bandits in the area have been completely suppressed. Residents who had sought refuge elsewhere are all leading the old and carrying the young, returning to their homes that they had left several years ago.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Songjiang Branch of the Red Cross Society</p>
<p>Adds a Refugee Shelter</p>
<p>The Songjiang branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society established a Zhejiang drought refugee shelter. Due to the surge in the number of refugees being accommodated, they plan to borrow the Minglun Hall of the Confucius Temple to set up a second shelter. They have telegraphed the headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society for the record. Here is the reply telegram: "To the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Vegetables [蔬] for Jian [鑒], Fish [魚] for telegram understood. The report of the proposed addition of a second shelter, borrowing the Minglun Hall of the Confucius Temple to expand accommodation, shows great enthusiasm for relief. Approval for the record is granted. It is still hoped that it will be handled with care. Seal of the Chinese Red Cross Society." It is also heard that Geng Junji, a Songjiang gentleman and currently a secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Government, deeply appreciates the branch's handling of the Zhejiang refugee shelter this time and has joined the Red Cross Society as a full member. In addition to household expenses, he donates all the rent rice he collects to the shelter to benefit the refugees. He also plans to gather like-minded people to thoroughly repair the Minglun Hall of the Confucius Temple after the shelter is closed. He also intends to find ways to ensure that the Songjiang branch's funds are permanently available. It is noted that Mr. Geng has always enthusiastically promoted local public welfare undertakings, so the people of Songjiang admire him endlessly.</p>
<h3>Extension of the Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition jointly organized by the Changqiao Elementary School of Songjiang County and the Songfeng Painting and Calligraphy Society at the Xin Songjiang Society on Songwei Road since the Lunar New Year has gathered hundreds of masterpieces by famous painters and calligraphers from home and abroad. The exhibits are dazzling and beautiful beyond compare. It has been open for more than a week, and visitors have been flocking to it, with over a thousand people daily. There has also been enthusiastic purchasing of paintings and calligraphy. It is learned that many people from other places who purchased painting and calligraphy vouchers issued by the society in advance have been unable to come to the exhibition to collect their items due to the continuous rain in recent days, and have sent letters requesting an extension of the closing date. Therefore, the organizers of the society, to avoid disappointing art lovers, have decided to extend the exhibition until February 18th (the Lantern Festival on the Lunar Calendar). It is also learned that the pricing department of the society has new works arriving, such as landscapes by Ms. Yu Yinzhan, running script by Ms. Yu Luxue, the eight-part script and running script by the Liu sisters, daughters of Mr. Liu San, Liu Xiu and Liu [𦇢], landscapes and flowers by the couple Liu Zhixun and Yu Yunfang, and mountain flowers and plants by the Sang Bo Yi and Zhong Ming brothers. Those who wish to order should act quickly, lest they miss the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>High Court Moves to Zhenjiang, Sets Up Branch Court</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court, currently located on Daoqian Street in Suzhou, is reportedly being moved to Zhenjiang by a decision of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and preparations are actively underway. It is expected to be implemented around July or August this year. Another Jiangsu High Court Fifth Branch will be established in Suzhou to handle appeals from Wu County, Kunshan, Wujiang, Qingpu, Changshu, Wuxi, and other counties. The address will be the original site of the Jiangsu High Court. The local Lawyers Association specifically raised the issue of the High Court's move to Zhenjiang for study at yesterday's review meeting. They unanimously advocated postponing the move to Zhenjiang and appointed Lu Hongyi to draft a memorial. Other legal organizations will also make statements on this matter.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>The Puzzling Case of Forced Enlistment</h3>
<p>There is a new recruit transportation station located in the Sanguan Hall of Chong'an Temple in this city. The person in charge is Wang Xiaoxian (nicknamed Wang Datou). Outsiders are mostly unclear about its operation. On weekdays, he constantly lures ignorant people inside and detains them. The other day, Tang Laoting from Piaoyang, Ren Laowu, Hu Baosheng, Zhang Jinying, etc. from Yixing took advantage of the Lunar New Year to come to Wuxi to perform lion dances, hoping to earn a small profit. Unexpectedly, when passing in front of the Sanguan Hall, Zhao Laosan, a cook from the station, told Tang and the others that the station currently needed several cooks, with a monthly salary of 16 yuan. Why not give up the lion dance life and take it? When Tang and the others refused, Zhao used his skills and flowery words to forcibly drag Tang and the other four inside and detain them. Until last night, Zhu, the wife of Ren Laowu, searched everywhere because her husband had not returned and only learned that he had entered the military. She rushed to the Sanguan Hall to seek a meeting with her husband and persuade him to return home. However, she was blocked by the recruitment office there and not allowed to meet him. Zhu, helpless, burst into tears, extremely miserable. At that time, Hang Tianliang, an employee of the First District Office, happened to see it, inquired about the details, and reported it to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau on her behalf. The police dispatched officers to summon Wang Xiaoxian, his assistant Lu Luogao, and Yang Laoting, Ren Laowu, Hu Baosheng, Zhang Jinying, etc. to the bureau. After questioning by Bureau Member Fan in court, it was stated that Jiangnan counties had long banned recruitment, and Wang and others clearly had fraudulent behavior. They were ordered to be temporarily detained in the bureau, pending instructions from the General Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>A Retrospective of Last Year's Commerce</h3>
<p>Wuxi has always been known for its prosperous commerce among the counties in the interior of Jiangsu Province. However, since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, it has been affected by the depression. The silk cocoon industry has declined severely, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the market is extremely bleak. During this winding-up period, although all industries were able to weather the difficulties, they were stretched thin. This year, businesses unanimously advocated tightening their belts. The situation of each industry is summarized below to measure the rise and fall of commerce. (1) Banking Industry: Shanghai banks regard Wuxi as a region for using funds, so they have come to Wuxi to open branches one after another. There are currently ten banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, the Continental Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the Xingye Bank, and the Zhongnan Commercial Bank. In addition to operating remittances and mortgages, they also provide credit to shops, so their businesses are extremely developed. In the first half of last year, each bank had excess cash and competed to lend at low interest rates, with weekly interest rates dropping to below 7%. By October, they received a notice from the head office to stop lending, and interest rates gradually rose, rising to over 1%. At the end of the year, each bank had a slight surplus, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications having the most, each with a surplus of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The rest were average. (2) Money Shops: After the failure of the silk factories, they all suffered losses in conjunction. The number decreased from 18 to 9. Furthermore, affected by the competition from banks, it became increasingly difficult for their business to develop. Fortunately, they proceeded cautiously, so they were still able to make a small profit at the end of the year. The Fuyu and Yonghengfeng money shops each made a surplus of 10,000 yuan. The rest, such as Fuyuan, Ruichang, Run Shen, Yuyuan, and Fengyi, also had slight surpluses. Others, such as Yunyu, Fuchang, and Sheng, were just enough to cover expenses. However, the Yunyu money shop is not listed because the shareholders have no intention of operating it. (3) Cotton Mills: In the midst of this extreme depression, each factory paid attention to internal reforms, so their products became more refined. Last year's business was the best for Lixin, with a surplus of more than 100,000 yuan. Qingfeng and Shenxin also each had a surplus of tens of thousands of yuan. The next best, such as Guangqin, Zhenxin, Yukang, and Yeqin, could only cover expenses because their cotton yarn could not compare. (4) Wheat Flour Factories: The industry refused foreign wheat last year. Although the raw materials were slightly insufficient, they reduced production, allowing the market price to be averaged. During the summer, the price of flour gradually rose, and sales became smooth again. Each factory rushed to manufacture, but it was still not enough to sell. However, once past August, the market repeated its silence. Each factory's surplus was 150,000 yuan for Jiufeng and a total of 200,000 yuan for Maoxin 1 and 2 factories, and more than 70,000 yuan for Tailong. (5) Silk and Cloth Industry: Since the January 28th Incident, followed by the failure of the silk factories and the decline of the rural economy, the industry has been greatly affected. Therefore, they closed down one after another, from more than 50 to 38. Last year, those in the rotten industry united and reorganized industry regulations, so they were able to make a profit at the end of the year. Rixin, Shihe, and Shitaisheng were the best. In addition, Maolun, Jiuyu, Jiulun, and Tianlun were all able to cover expenses. The rest were average. (6) Dried Goods Industry: There are 26 major firms that have joined the industry association. Last year, affected by the drought and the market decline, business was only about 70% of the previous year. Wanda was the best, with a surplus of about 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. The rest were difficult to profit from. Taoyao Yanhe Zhi Ruhao, a shop with more than 20 years of history, closed down during the winding-up period due to poor business and is currently being liquidated.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Towns and Villages Robbed During the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, gambling is rampant in various villages and towns as usual, making it easy for thieves to hide. Song Zhongyang, a national doctor in the Langangqiao Town in the west countryside, has a thriving business. His son, Song Chushi, is currently the principal of Shuqin Girls' High School. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 9th, four thieves suddenly broke into the Song family's house. At the time, Song happened to be out visiting patients, and only the housewife and two servants were left at home, who were all tied up. After being robbed for about an hour, they packed up the soft goods and gold jewelry and left, with a loss of about 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Preparations for Dredging Huangtian Port are Underway</p>
<p>The issue of dredging Huangtian Port in this city has been repeatedly discussed and planned. The dredging has been approved by the Construction Department, with a budget of 160,000 yuan. The province provided 65,000 yuan, and the remaining 95,000 yuan will be drawn from the local construction fee item. The engineering office is attached to the Zhenwu Canal Dredging Engineering Office and is named [Zhenwu Canal Dredging Engineering No. 9 Section Office of Huangtian Port.] It is temporarily borrowing a portion of the County Party Headquarters' building for office space. The position of section chief is concurrently held by Lu Bingzhang, the section chief of the County Government's Third Section. One engineer and two engineering staff have not yet been determined. As for the dam construction and dredging machines, personnel have been dispatched to negotiate. On the 10th, the County Government convened a discussion meeting to discuss all the progress matters.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Director Yu Pays Attention to the Huangcao Bridge Homicide Case</p>
<p>Su [蘇] Provincial Civil Affairs Director Yu Jingtang recently learned from newspaper reports about the homicide case in Caoqiao Town in the Eighth District. Considering that it involved the killing of a person by the security team and that the circumstances were seriously suspicious, he specifically instructed Police Inspector Li Kaizhou to conduct an investigation when he departed for inspections in various counties. After arriving in Changzhou on the 9th, Inspector Li went to the County Government to meet with Secretary Yang Zhaoyun and inquired about the circumstances of the Caoqiao case. Secretary Yang replied that the County Government only had reports from the District Office, etc., and that the case was currently under investigation by the court's procuratorate and had not yet been clarified. Li then accompanied Yang to the court to meet with Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongyi and inquired in great detail. On the morning of the 10th, Li had not yet obtained the key points. Whether the security team leader Zhou Zhongsheng had any adulterous vendetta or if it was the accidental killing of a thief still needed further investigation. In addition to going to the County Government to review the case files, he also inquired about the basis of the newspaper reports. He then learned that the case was first disclosed by the Wuxi National Herald. Li then took a car to Wuxi in the afternoon to investigate before returning to the office to report.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Female Drug Trafficker Sent to the Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee sent personnel to Nantong and cracked down on a drug trafficking organization in the Baijiayuan area outside the South Gate. They seized seven packages of morphine and captured the principal offender, Zhu Chen. After questioning by the county government, she was transferred to the Nantong District Commissioner's Office for military law questioning.</p>
<h3>Relief for Coastal Fisheries</h3>
<p>The fisheries along the coast of Tong suffered from harassment by sea bandits last year, coupled with the drought in Jiangnan and other places, resulting in sluggish sales of marine products. The fisheries were severely hit. According to statistics, income was only 600,000 yuan, only 60% of the previous year. The Nantong Fisheries Association has applied to the provincial and county governments for the implementation of a relief plan.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Hengsheng Money Shop Closes Down</p>
<p>The Hengsheng Money Shop in front of the Chenghuang Temple in this city has been open for 35 years. Recently, due to poor business and years of losses, it was calculated that the deficit was over 80,000 yuan during this winding-up period. Shareholder Yu did not want to continue to subsidize it, so it was decided to close down and liquidate. Starting the other day (the 8th), registration of claims began, and debtors were urged to repay their debts as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Municipal News Participates in London Art Exhibition</p>
<h3>Yesterday Began Pre-Selection of Antiquities</h3>
<p>To Be Pre-Exhibited in Beijing and Shanghai Before Transport to England</p>
<p>The British London Chinese Art Exhibition has already leased the Billington Building in London as its venue and is scheduled to officially open in November of this year. The exhibition will fully introduce all Chinese antiquities and art from past dynasties to the international community. Its nature is quite important, so it seeks to be comprehensive in its collection of exhibits. From ancient times to 1800, precious Chinese antiquities from all dynasties are included in the collection. The Chinese government has also agreed to transport some of the rare treasures stored in Shanghai for display. Special commissioners from the British authorities have come to China to select them together with the Chinese government. In the future, the British government will be fully responsible for the protection of these antiquities during transportation to London.</p>
<h3>Selection of Antiquities</h3>
<p>For the sake of selecting antiquities, the Chinese government has now designated Chuan Yiwen, section chief of the Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior; Tan Keheng, staff member; Wang Rong, head of the managing section; and Zhang Jinheng of the Chinese Antiquities Preservation Committee, four people, who arrived in Shanghai the other day and contacted Ouyang Daoda, section chief of the Shanghai Office of the Palace Museum, to discuss everything. Yesterday morning, led by Section Chief Ouyang, they opened the warehouse on Zhutang Street and began the selection. A portion of the antiquities has already been selected. The selection will continue today. The antiquities that have already been selected will be sealed in another room in order to be sent to the China Bank pre-exhibition venue on Renji Road in time for arrangements. The antiquities selected by Section Chief Chuan and others from the Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior, etc., in Zhutang Street are the antiquities previously stored in that warehouse by the Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior and have nothing to do with the antiquities stored in Shanghai by the Palace Museum in Beijing. Section Chief Chuan and others were very careful when selecting yesterday, because this Chinese art exhibition in London is of great importance to the reputation of Chinese art. Therefore, the selected antiquities are all the most exquisite.</p>
<h3>Beijing and Shanghai Pre-Exhibitions</h3>
<p>After the Palace Museum's antiquities were freely transported to Shanghai, the Chinese authorities originally planned to hold a public exhibition. However, due to the large number of boxes and complicated procedures, as well as the lack of suitable locations, it was temporarily suspended and could not be realized. Now that the antiquities will be selected and transported to England for exhibition, it has been decided to take this opportunity to hold pre-exhibitions in Beijing and Shanghai before the antiquities are transported to England to publicly exhibit them so that the public can understand the exact number of antiquities. The exhibition location in Shanghai has now been found on the second floor of the China Bank on Renji Road on the Bund, because the bank has completely moved into its new location for office work. The venue will soon be arranged, and it is scheduled to open in early March. After the exhibition in Shanghai closes, it will be transported to Beijing for exhibition and then transported to England to participate in the Chinese Art Exhibition.</p>
<h3>Request for Protection</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Bureau, Chinese artworks will be transported to London, England, for exhibition. Before the shipment, the Preparatory Committee plans to hold a preliminary exhibition at the former site of the China Bank on the Bund and has requested the Public Works Bureau to provide special protection. According to the opinion of the Police Department, it is not necessary to charge a fee for specially dispatching police to provide protection, but it cannot assume responsibility for the safety of the items. Furthermore, the arrangement of the exhibition venue must be handled in accordance with the conditions of the Public Works and Fire Departments. The Public Works Bureau has replied to the committee with this intention. It is heard that the exhibition is scheduled to be held in mid-March.</p>
<h3>Commissioner Comes to China</h3>
<p>In order to select antiquities together with the Chinese government, the British government has now specially dispatched a team of five famous Chinese art collectors as commissioners to China for selection. They have already departed from England and are expected to arrive in Shanghai in early March. The list of commissioners is recorded below: (1) Omofopoulos, British art expert and collector, president of the Oriental Ceramic Society; (2) Hobson, British art expert, currently director of the Department of Ceramics and Ethnology at the British National Museum, author of "On Chinese Ceramics"; (3) Yeats, famous British artist; (4) David, member of the Executive Committee of the Oriental Ceramic Society, member of the Chinese Committee of the Universities of London; (5) Raffael, member of the Archaeological Society, honorary assistant of the Department of Oriental Antiquities of the British Museum, member of the Executive Committee of the Oriental Ceramic Society.</p>
<h3>Continued Verification</h3>
<p>Regarding the verification work of the antiquities stored in Shanghai by the Palace Museum in Beijing, it was temporarily suspended a few days ago because Shu Chushi left Shanghai for business. It is learned that Mr. Shu will return to Shanghai today, so the verification work can continue today. Since the beginning of the verification of all the antiquities stored in Shanghai by the Palace Museum, more than 500 boxes have been verified so far.</p>
<h3>Hunan Fellow Townsmen Gave Public Farewell Banquet to Minister He Yesterday</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Turkish Minister He Yaozu is about to leave the country to take up his new post. Fellow Hunan townsmen in this city gave a public farewell banquet for him at the Atlantic Western Restaurant at 12:00 noon yesterday. Over twenty people attended, including Zhou Daoyu, Qin Zhen, Cheng Qian, Zhang Shizhao, Ye Kaixin, Chen Jie, Liu Jingyin, Zhou Di, Nie Lusheng, Hong Ziyi, Sun Yongmou, Chen Queting, Shen Zuru, Zhang Bingwen, Li Wuyun, etc.</p>
<h3>Chen Jie Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Saying, "Today, fellow townsmen and colleagues are happily giving a farewell banquet to Minister He Guiyan. Personally, I have three congratulatory points: (1) Speaking of Minister He personally, he is a famous general of the party and the country and is taking on an important diplomatic mission. As Su Laoquan said, 'A man who cannot be a general can be an envoy, and settling matters with words is enough.' Now that Minister He is taking on a diplomatic mission as a famous general, his responsibility is not just settling matters with words. This is the first. (2) Speaking of fellow Hunan townsmen, after Zeng and Guo, there have been almost no one in diplomacy for fifty years. Now Minister He is rising to fame and succeeding, and his future achievements are immeasurable. This is the second. (3) Speaking of the Chinese nation, Turkey and China were both 'sick men of the East' in the imperial era. However, with more than ten years of struggle, political reform, diplomatic victory, judicial independence, and expansion of civil rights, it has become a strong Islamic country, which can be used as a reference for our country. Moreover, Chinese Muslims are found throughout Shaanxi and Xinjiang provinces and have a close historical relationship with Turkey. This time, Minister He will surely obtain a deep relationship between the two countries, both in national relations and in national sentiment.' and so on." Then,</p>
<h3>He's Reply</h3>
<p>Briefly saying, "Today, I am very grateful for the grand intentions of you all. This time, the government has appointed me as an envoy to Turkey to handle diplomacy. With my meager learning, I originally did not dare to rashly take on the responsibility. However, my request to decline was not granted. Furthermore, considering the current crisis of the country, which is in a critical moment, I could not refuse the responsibility of a commoner. I can only exhaust my meager strength in order to repay the country. I would like to state a few points to you all: (1) Turkey is a newly emerging independent and free country. Examining the elements of its strength, it is due to the soundness of its nation's inherent culture and the solidity of the country's organization, which have created today's glorious position. Looking back at our country, these elements are far inferior. Under this comparison, we cannot but imitate, strive, and make progress as soon as possible. (2) The direction of a country's diplomacy should be an extension of its internal affairs. Therefore, in order to achieve diplomatic results, the focus is on the progress of domestic politics. Although I am temporarily leaving the country, I am constantly praying for the unification and solidarity of the country and the construction and prosperity of the economy. If the country itself can make real progress, it will not only promote the determination of countries around the world to recognize China's desire for independence and freedom, but also make it impossible for strong countries to infringe. Turkey was able to gain the sympathy of countries around the world and achieve the effect of recovery because of this. This is also something that our country can learn from. (3) After I leave the country, I should report my findings at any time, but I hope that you all in the country will provide instructions and assistance at any time so that we can make contributions to the party and the country from both inside and outside." and so on.</p>

<h3>Social Construction: Issues of Marriage and Funeral Rites</h3>
<p>丨Mayor Wu's Report at the Municipal Government's Memorial Week丨</p>
<p>Current Rituals are Chaotic and Lack Standards</p>
<p>Corrections Should Be Made to Ensure Social Conformity</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Municipal Government held Premier's Memorial Week yesterday morning at the Municipal Government Auditorium. Several people, including staff from the Municipal Government Secretariat and various bureaus, attended. Mayor Wu Tiecheng led the ceremony and reported on [Issues of Marriage and Funeral Rites in Social Construction]. His original words are as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, at the last joint memorial week, I gave a comprehensive report on the municipal government's policy guidelines for this year and explained that this year is the "Social Construction Year" for this city. I hope that all colleagues will, within this year of the Republic of China's 24th year, work diligently on the construction of social undertakings, based on the principles of social construction. However, there are many social undertakings that need construction. Our time, financial resources, and manpower do not permit us to complete them all in one, two, three, or four years. Moreover, social undertakings are never completely finished in a single day because society is progressing every day. We should naturally also be innovative and strive tirelessly, keeping pace with the times. Therefore, we can only select a few of the most urgent social undertakings within the scope permitted by our time, financial resources, and manpower to undertake this year. However, in addition to the social undertakings we stipulated last time, there is another matter related to social morality that needs to arouse the attention and research of all colleagues in our municipal government, and also the attention and research of all citizens of Shanghai, which is matters of marriage, funerals, and celebrations.</p>
<p>This is something that we all consider a very important event in one's life. However, the marriage, funeral, and celebration rituals currently popular in society are mostly equivalent to child's play, simply without any rituals to speak of. In the past, our country had fixed rituals for coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, funerals, and sacrifices, and everyone respected them equally. These old rituals were certainly very cumbersome and did not conform to the spirit of the modern era. However, after abolishing the old rituals, we have not yet established new rituals. What is currently popular in society is neither Eastern nor Western, neither ancient nor modern. Each person has their own way, today is different from tomorrow, and tomorrow is different from the day after, making society almost a society without rules. Everyone does as they please. How can we unite such a chaotic and disorderly society?</p>
<p>We know that the first requirement for a healthy social life is to be able to unite and have discipline. To make society united and disciplined, we must give this society a common custom, so that all the individuals living in the whole society have a common standard to abide by. Only then can this society be united and disciplined, and the foundation of this society can be stable. However, Chinese society today is neither Eastern nor Western, neither modern nor ancient. There are no definite rituals, making us all at a loss and causing contradictions everywhere. We see that the funeral processions on the streets of Shanghai now are, in many ways, just like joyous events. Moreover, the ceremonial guards are originally intended to express solemnity, but they are filled by people who are extremely undignified. Their spirit and posture are not neat, and the clothing they wear is especially bizarre. The music played by the military band often plays happy music for funerals and funeral music for happy events, fully demonstrating that our society has no rules and no rituals. Once, a cosmetics company held a ceremony for the completion of a new factory and invited me to attend. At that time, the music team suddenly started playing national music when they shouldn't have. The audience all stood up, but the musicians were sitting and didn't stand up, and they didn't play in unison. Two of them only started playing halfway through the song. We can't list all the similar things. In short, there is disorder everywhere. There are also no definite rules for weddings. Even the so-called civilized weddings have several problems. First, the bride and groom exchange rings, but they don't exchange them personally; instead, the male and female attendants exchange them on their behalf. Second, they don't personally stamp the marriage certificate; instead, the male and female attendants represent them. Third, the speeches at the wedding are mostly treated as child's play, and many obscene words are even used, without any solemnity. Therefore, whenever someone asks me to officiate at a wedding, I must make three rules: First, the bride and groom must exchange rings personally; second, they must stamp the certificate personally; and third, no one is allowed to tell jokes or use obscene words during the wedding, lest they undermine the solemnity of the wedding.</p>
<p>Weddings and funerals are two extremely important events in society. These two extremely important events in society show that Chinese society has no rules, no rituals, and no organization; it is just a mess. In this situation, how can we unite society, make society excited, and make society move? Establishing rituals and making music are certainly the powers of the central government, but the situation of such a lack of rituals in society, even to the point of absurdity, cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. Therefore, we should also pay attention and make corrections. I have already ordered the Social Bureau to ban the bizarre costumes of commercial military bands and order them to play happy music for happy events and funeral music for funerals, with definite rules. At the same time, I have also ordered the Public Security Bureau to ban funeral processions. However, such passive prohibition is not enough to be effective. Therefore, a definite standard must be set so that everyone in society has something to follow, in order to prevent the current situation of lacking standards, disorder, and chaos from appearing in the future Shanghai society. This is also something that all colleagues in the municipal government should pay attention to and work hard on when working on social construction this year of the Republic of China's 24th year. Secondly, everyone must remember that the anniversary of the New Life Movement will soon arrive. We should work harder to realize the ideals of the New Life Movement by improving the general customs of society.</p>
<h3>The Minsheng Company's "Minkang" Ship Sinks</h3>
<p>At Duntou, 30 Miles from Hankou</p>
<p>All Crew Members Rescued; Losses Exceed 100,000</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: The "Minkang" ship of Sichuan's Minsheng Industrial Company sank at Duntou, 30 miles from Hankou, on the afternoon of the 8th due to shallow water and hitting a reef. Yesterday, the reporter inquired at the Henan Road branch in this port, and the information obtained is as follows:</p>
<h3>Minsheng's Operations</h3>
<p>The headquarters of Minsheng Industrial Company is located in Chongqing, with a branch in this port. The general manager is Mr. Lu Zuofu. The company has 27 river steamers and shallow-water vessels, exclusively sailing along the Yangtze River and the Jialing River and Qu River banks. The "Minkang" originally sailed on the Shanghai-Chongqing line. Recently, due to shallow water in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, it only sailed to Yichang. The ship was built in England and has a larger hull than other ships, with a gross tonnage of 618 tons and a net tonnage of only 262 tons. It has been sailing between Shanghai and Chongqing for five years.</p>
<h3>Details of the Reef Collision</h3>
<p>This time, the "Minkang" loaded cargo in Shanghai last month and sailed upstream. After arriving in Yichang, due to the military situation of bandit suppression in northern Sichuan, it was dispatched to Hankou empty on the 5th of this month. Unexpectedly, at 12 noon on the 8th, when the ship arrived at Duntou, 30 miles from Hankou, it mistakenly hit a reef due to shallow water and rapid currents. The hull suffered severe damage and sank immediately. At that time, the crew prepared to rescue the ship, but it was too late. The captain urgently sent a distress signal. Fortunately, a nearby small ship heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue. Moreover, the ship did not carry passengers or cargo besides the crew, so there was no danger to life. The ship has now completely sunk, and all crew members have been rescued and are temporarily staying at the Hankou branch, awaiting further arrangements.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Losses</h3>
<p>Although the ship has sunk after hitting a reef, it was an empty ship and not loaded with goods. When it slowly sank, all the crew members' belongings were also transferred to a small ship. Therefore, the only losses are the ship's hull and furniture, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan. However, the ship's hull was insured with a foreign company for marine insurance, so no significant losses are expected. Whether to salvage the ship or not will be decided after the Chongqing headquarters sends personnel to survey the situation. Due to a delay in airmail, the Shanghai branch has not yet received a written report on the details of the accident.</p>
<p>Another source reports that the ship was insured with a North American insurance company for 70,000 yuan. The current captain is Yuan Changfa, it is said.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Kunming Airline to Open Soon; Ford Aircraft Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Vessel Loaded in America is En Route</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in Late February</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: China National Aviation Corporation, to open the Shanghai-Kunming airline, which passes through the Yangtze River line to Kunming, Yunnan, conducted a test flight earlier with satisfactory results. Considering that the route, though not long, passes through continuous mountains and steep peaks, requiring a sturdy, large aircraft, it ordered a large Ford aircraft from the aircraft manufacturing department of the Ford Motor Company in America last October for this purpose. According to the Shen Shi News Agency's sources at China National Aviation Corporation, the aircraft was completed in America half a month ago and was shipped by the Maersk Line (Gertrude Maersk) a week ago. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in late February. This is a large, three-engine aircraft with 1,450 horsepower, a speed of 135 miles per hour, ten passenger seats, and two pilot seats, accommodating ten passengers in total. It is equipped with both land-to-air and air-to-land wireless radios, costing a total of 40,000 US dollars, or about 150,000 Chinese yuan. The company plans to install the aircraft as soon as it arrives in Shanghai to conduct a second test flight to Kunming in mid-March. If everything goes well, the direct Shanghai-Kunming airline should be open by the end of March or early April.</p>
<h3>Radio Communication Between Lhasa and Shanghai Now Open</h3>
<p>Officially Sending and Receiving Commercial Telegrams</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: The Shanghai Radio Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications previously proposed opening the radio station of Special Envoy Huang Musong in Lhasa, Tibet, for commercial use. After several test transmissions with good results, the circuit, which passes from Lhasa through Ganzi and Chengdu to Shanghai, is now officially open. The telegram fee is charged according to the Chengdu long-distance rate. Commercial telegrams from Tibet can be sent to the Radio Telegraph Bureau at No. 565 Lao Beimen starting today, it is said.</p>
<h3>Communication Between Shanghai and the Northeast</h3>
<p>Wireless Communication Has Not Been Interrupted</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: As the commercial hub, this port has maintained communication with the Northeast via wireless transmission through Harbin since the September 18th Incident, without interruption. Since the resumption of railway traffic, telegrams sent from this port to the Northeast have become even more frequent. As for the telegraph lines from this port to Dalian, they are directly connected via undersea cable, which was established by Japan and has never been interrupted. Now that land lines outside the customs have been opened, telegrams from this port to the Northeast, especially those to the South Manchuria area, may be forwarded through Tianjin. Telegrams to the North Manchuria area will still be transmitted wirelessly. Any telegrams containing the words "puppet organization" will not be transmitted, in accordance with postal regulations.</p>
<h3>Jianmu Industry Declining; Lumber Merchants Appeal for Relief</h3>
<p>Petition to Revoke Bankruptcies and Cancel Harsh Taxes: Details of the Situation</p>
<p>Fujian is one of China's leading timber-producing provinces, but has declined in recent years due to banditry and political upheavals. Recently, the delegation of petitioners from the Min River Upper Reaches Fir Timber Industry Association issued a notice detailing the bankruptcy of Jianben and the petition to cancel harsh taxes, as follows:</p>
<p>Our country is rich in timber resources, which not only supply domestic needs but also sell abroad in considerable quantities. Among the timber-producing areas, apart from the three northeastern provinces, Fujian is the most prominent. Hence, it is named Jianmu after the region. Among the Jianmu production areas, the four prefectures of Yanping, Jianning, Shaowu, and Tingzhou in northwestern Fujian are the most abundant. The livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in these prefectures depend heavily on this industry. Before the 11th year of the Republic, the annual output was 40,000 to 50,000 chains, worth over 10 million yuan. Recently, it has sharply declined, falling to no more than 10,000 chains this year, worth 3 to 4 million yuan. The reason for the decline lies in the disturbances of the Red disaster, which destroyed the rural areas, and the excessive taxation, which increased costs. The sales prices did not match, and businesses repeatedly failed. Timber merchants stopped operating one after another, mountain prices were affected and lowered, timber farmers intermittently planted trees, timber workers lost their jobs and took risks, and social unrest occurred. All of these are based on this. However, Jianmu has suffered such devastation that it is on the verge of bankruptcy. Foreign timber has seized the opportunity to invade the entire country at low prices, and the economy has overflowed outward. The future of national and people's livelihoods is extremely worrying. To save this predicament, we must eliminate the Red bandits, revive the rural areas, abolish harsh taxes, and protect domestic timber. (1) The Red disaster: The production of timber in northwestern Fujian is abundant, and the livelihoods of the people depend on it. However, since the 17th year of the Republic, the Communist bandits occupied western Fujian, and in the 19th year, they spread to northern Fujian. Wherever the bandits went, they burned, plundered, raped, and killed, making people unable to live. Fields were desolate, and rural areas were ruined. The timber industry was therefore abandoned. Fortunately, the central government's suppression was effective, and the Fujian bandits were pacified within a year. Unfortunately, the vitality was damaged, and recovery was not easy. Survivors after the disaster are heartbroken to speak of it. (2) Exploitation by harsh taxes: The procedures for purchasing fir timber, including cutting, digging, dragging, releasing, loading, and transporting, all have fixed times, requiring at least five or six months. In addition, the capital is very large, and the loading and transportation are heavy. Transporting along the river to Fuzhou is as long as eight or nine hundred miles, and recently it has exceeded two hundred miles. In addition, the Min River has rapid currents, and there are fixed stations for berthing. It is impossible to be fast. Corrupt local bullies, local ruffians, and bandits along the way are well aware of the above-mentioned relationships and know the inside story, arousing thoughts of coveting and extortion, resorting to any means to demand fees. As a result, the number of donation and tax items has exceeded 30. Although the government has repeatedly issued prohibitions, it is beyond reach. There is nothing that can be done. In addition, legitimate tax items are often inflated by corrupt officials. Timber merchants suffer from this exploitation and cannot bear it. (A) A brief history of the temporary housing assistance fee at Shuikou: Judging from the name, it is known that this levy is neither a tax nor a donation, but a temporary fee, which is meaningless. The period when this fee was established was in the 21st year of the Republic, when the central government clearly ordered the abolition of the escort donation collected by miscellaneous troops on the Min River. The 19th Route Army did not dare to violate the central government's order. On the one hand, it wanted to recover what it had already collected. At that time, it immediately gathered stream merchants and discussed the matter. It was claimed that the escort fee was cancelled by the order of the Ministry, but since Liu and Lu's troops had no way to raise funds, the temporary defense assistance fee was changed to be established at Shuikou, collecting 45 yuan for each chain of timber rafts with 13 or more bottoms, and 40 yuan for each chain with 15 or fewer bottoms. It was limited to six months and would not be extended. Adding to the burden of merchants and people, no matter what, they temporarily endured it with difficulty. At that time, there were thousands of chains of timber rafts accumulated at Shuikou. Timber merchants, due to capital relations and under the coercion of warlords, had little power to resist. They had to endure the levy, thinking that it was only temporary. Unexpectedly, it has been more than two years, and the warlord rebellion has been defeated. Liu and Lu's military pay has been issued by the central government. The Red disaster has gradually subsided, and the Fujian situation has been stabilized. However, the harsh donations created by the rebels to harm merchants and people still exist and have become even more serious. In the past, the reporting procedures and escort patrol boats were handled by members of our association who set up offices on behalf of customers. Recently, the office has also taken on patrol boats, soliciting protection fees, taking the opportunity to supplement reports, and doing whatever they want. Timber merchants suffer twice as much as before. Although they have repeatedly appealed to the office, it has been ineffective. (B) A brief history of the business tax in Zhuzhi: After the party center clearly ordered the abolition of lijin, the Fujian provincial authorities created a consumption tax due to a sharp decline in revenue, stipulating that 5% would be levied per 100, with producers and consumers sharing half each. The bureau was originally set up in Hongjiang Zhongzhou to collect taxes. During the tenure of Mr. He Gonggan as director of the Finance Department, it was moved to Zhuzhi. When the central government promulgated the business tax regulations, it was levied on the category of bamboo and wood sales, set at 2/1000. Merchants and people should pay the legitimate tax set by the central government. Unexpectedly, the tax bureau violated the order of the Ministry and forcibly collected 5%, paying taxes per chain, about 25 yuan. Even randomly increasing the levy to 6% or 7% when reporting, practicing the consumption tax in the name of the business tax. The principle of business tax is to levy taxes in the location where the business is located, but Zhuzhi is located in the hinterland of the Min River, not the business location of timber rafts. Setting up a bureau to collect taxes halfway is a clear violation of the regulations. Now that the rebel He has been defeated, the remnants of his evil deeds should have been corrected long ago under the rule of the pure and upright party, to comply with the orders of the Ministry and to alleviate the people's suffering. (C) Other harsh taxes: Public welfare, education, military service, culture, charity, and protection donation in Nanping County; schools, hospitals, and education donations in Gutian County; land protection, raft watching, and garrison wine fees at various stations along the way; debt allocation for the Minbei Highway; etc., are no more than 30 types, collecting from a few jiao to several yuan arbitrarily, leaving people with no choice. (3) Cost and sale price: Jianmu is assembled into chains, with many types, depending on the length and size of the wood. The names are also different, such as 9-bottom, 11-bottom, 13-bottom, 15-bottom, 18-bottom, and 21-bottom. (A) Cost: The mountain price per chain is about 156 yuan, the cost of cutting, dragging, and releasing is about 80 yuan, miscellaneous expenses and interest are about 30 yuan, the cost of loading and nailing is about 20 yuan, the cost of transportation and wages is about 90 yuan, and legitimate taxes and harsh taxes are about 80 to 90 yuan. The total cost per chain is about 400 yuan. (B) Sale price: Taking the 13-bottom timber as an estimate, each section sells for 3 yuan, the 15-bottom sells for 2 yuan, and the 18-bottom sells for 1 yuan. Then, each chain of timber rafts is only worth over 300 yuan. Comparing the cost and sale price, the loss is significant. The bankruptcy of Jianmu is undeniable. (4) The petition process and results: Timber merchants, due to excessive burdens and losses of capital, have stopped operating one after another. Jianmu is therefore bankrupt. The future of hundreds of thousands of people in more than 20 counties in northwestern Fujian is worrying. Therefore, timber merchants have repeatedly come to the association to voice their concerns. Examining the actual situation, the suffering is unbearable. Our association could not bear to sit idly by and has repeatedly submitted telegrams to the central government's competent authorities, seeking relief and requesting that harsh taxes be abolished and illegal tax rates be corrected. The instructions were received, "Order the Fujian provincial government to investigate and handle." It was then submitted to the Fujian provincial authorities, requesting that they be revoked and corrected. A reply was received, "Since this defense expenditure is a major local revenue, and the military is in urgent need of funds during the bandit suppression period, it is difficult to revoke it temporarily. As for the business tax on bamboo and wood, it is collected according to the old rate and has been in place for a long time, making it even more difficult to approve changes immediately." In this way, the timber merchants could not bear it. In December of the past year, the joint meeting of the three associations decided to nominate Chen Xinyuan and Xuan Yongsheng as representatives to go to Beijing to petition the central government's various ministries and commissions, requesting that they quickly order the revocation in order to alleviate the people's suffering and save the timber industry. The central government's various ministries and commissions were sympathetic to the merchants' difficulties. The Ministry of Finance telegraphed on the 18th of December, letter No. 1164, "The telegrams from December 23rd are noted. We have already telegraphed the Fujian provincial government to strictly order the swift revocation of the Shuikou defense fee and the correction of the business tax rate in Zhuzhi." After receiving the order, we immediately nominated comrades Huang and Liu to represent us in visiting the chairman of the Fujian provincial government and the director of the Finance Department. We submitted two reports, requesting that they be implemented separately in accordance with the orders of the Ministry. However, there was no reply, only a verbal answer that the finances were difficult and it was inconvenient to revoke them. Not getting the point, we sent Chen Xinyuan and others to Beijing for a second petition. We received another telegram from the Ministry of Finance on January 21st, letter No. 1801, "The report from January 22nd and the association's wireless telegram are noted. We have already telegraphed the Fujian provincial government again to follow the previous case and strictly order them to comply. You should be informed immediately." The Executive Yuan issued an instruction on January 31st, No. 46, "The report is noted. This case has been submitted to the Yuan for handling by the Central Government. It has been instructed to be submitted to the Fujian provincial government for handling together. You should be informed immediately." The instructions from the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the People's Movement Guidance Committee have been forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review. The Military Affairs Commission has also issued an instruction, "Send it to the Ministry of Finance for review." The representatives have repeatedly stated everything to the central competent authorities. They have also received instructions from various ministries and commissions, ordering the Fujian provincial government to strictly order the revocation of the Shuikou defense fee and the correction of the heavy business tax in Zhuzhi. We should wait quietly for the Fujian provincial authorities to comply with the orders of the Ministry and implement them separately. (5) Appeal to the public opinion circles for assistance: The petition to revoke the defense fee and correct the business tax on bamboo and wood has been clearly ordered by the central competent authorities to comply. This proves the central government's determination to abolish harsh taxes. However, the suffering of the timber merchants is difficult for the people of the country to hear everywhere. However, public opinion is the mouthpiece of the people. To make the whole country understand the decline of Jianmu, the invasion of foreign timber, and the reasons for the unemployment of the people of Fujian, we still need the assistance of the news media to arouse the attention of the people of the country and jointly save the crisis. Abolishing harsh taxes is to relieve Jianmu. Relieving Jianmu is to resist foreign timber, so that we can recover our rights and benefit the people. We have always admired you as leaders of the press and the eyes and ears of the people. Please provide assistance with correct public opinion, so that hundreds of thousands of timber people in Fujian can celebrate their rebirth. We will be infinitely grateful.</p>

<h3>Polish Envoy in China Informs the Chamber of Commerce Explaining the Reason for Heavy Taxes on Chinese Goods</h3>
<p>Due to Failure to Submit Proof of Origin</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from Wu Zemin, a merchant residing in Poland, stating that he had been living in Poland for many years and that the hand-woven grass baskets from our country were very popular with the Polish people. He entrusted Shanghai Xindali to purchase and transport them to Poland for sale. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the port, the customs officials of that country excessively raised tariffs. The cost was less than one Chinese dollar, but they demanded three times that amount. The tax levied on grass baskets transported from Czechoslovakia to Poland was less than 80% of the value. The difference was enormous. He requested the Chamber of Commerce to step forward and strongly protest. The Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the previous day, requesting them to negotiate based on reason and to strive to ensure that Chinese goods exported to Poland would not be hindered or stalled. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the Polish Legation in China sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce explaining the reasons for the heavy taxes on Chinese goods. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the esteemed members of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce,</p>
<p>In recent days, various Chinese newspapers in this city have published a letter from Mr. Wu, a Chinese merchant, addressed to your esteemed Chamber, stating that a number of grass baskets were transported to our country for sale, but were heavily taxed by our customs officials, while similar goods transported to Poland from other countries were taxed very lightly. Our Legation is aware that this complaint does not conform to the facts, and that the reasons for the heavy taxation have not been stated. We dare to inform you of a few things so that your esteemed Chamber can understand the details of this matter.</p>
<p>According to the Treaty of Commerce signed between our two countries on September 18, 1929, all Polish goods transported to China and Chinese goods transported to Poland for sale shall be granted most-favored-nation treatment. The volume of Chinese goods exported to our country each year is quite large. Our customs officials have always assessed them according to regulations, and we have never heard any complaints from Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>During the past ten months, the value of certificates of origin for commercial goods issued by our Legation and used by Chinese merchants going to Poland amounted to 1,117,0517 customs gold units. The types and prices of these goods are listed below:</p>
<p>㈠ Soybeans and sesame: 891.609</p>
<p>㈡ Peanuts: 328.13</p>
<p>㈢ Tea: 35.05</p>
<p>㈣ Cinnamon and other spices: 13.174</p>
<p>㈤ Pig bristles: 7.29</p>
<p>㈥ Albumin: 4.487</p>
<p>㈦ Egg yolk: 9.537</p>
<p>㈧ Antimony: 13.743</p>
<p>㈨ Bean cake: 7572</p>
<p>㈩ Tung oil: 3.646</p>
<p>㈩㈠ Mutton tallow and other fats: 3.086</p>
<p>㈩㈡ Other oils: 20.195</p>
<p>㈩㈢ Pig intestines: 28.540</p>
<p>Reviewing the above statistics, it is clear that there is such a large volume of trade between our two countries, and no disputes have ever occurred. Why would our customs officials apply differential treatment only to goods worth just over six gold pounds? Perhaps this is Mr. Wu's first time doing business in Poland, and therefore he has not followed the regulations. As a rule, when Chinese merchants transport goods to Poland, they must submit a certificate of origin to our Legation for verification and stamping. Our customs officials will then assess and release the goods based on this certificate. Mr. Wu only submitted a bill of lading to our Legation, without the certificate of origin issued by the Ministry of Industry of your country. After the goods arrived in our country, he did not present the stamped bill of lading for verification, claiming that the bill of lading had been lost en route. Therefore, our customs officials identified the type of goods according to the customs tax list. Also, because the raw materials of the grass baskets transported by Mr. Wu were not recognized by anyone in our country, and he could not present the certificate issued by the Commodity Inspection Bureau of your country, the customs officers considered these grass baskets to be made of a special type of grass, and levied the highest level of tax.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the gross weight of the grass baskets transported by Mr. Wu to our country was 243 kilograms, but the packaging accounted for 110 kilograms. Therefore, a large portion of the customs duties paid by Mr. Wu was consumed by the packaging.</p>
<p>Our Legation also has a similar experience. Last year, a certain exporter from our country transported some salted pork to this country for sale. Your country's customs officials considered it cured meat and levied a tax that was fifteen times higher than the tax on salted meat. The exporter paid a total of 250 Chinese dollars in taxes, and then sold the salted pork in Shanghai, actually earning 160 dollars, including the customs duties. Our Legation believed that the reason why the Polish merchant paid heavy taxes was that he could not present the certificate of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of our country certifying that it was salted meat, so there was no way to negotiate for him. Although the Polish merchant suffered a significant loss, he did not write to the press to complain about the injustice.</p>
<p>If your esteemed Chamber examines the above, you should be able to understand everything about the origin of this matter.</p>
<h3>Hong Mian, Investigator of Anhui Disaster, Reports on the Disaster Situation in Zhide County, Anhui</h3>
<p>Drafting Plans for Purchasing Grain to Save the Dying, Providing Agricultural Loans, and Assisting Livelihoods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Central Relief Committee recently received a telegram from Hong Mian, who investigated the disaster in Anhui, outlining plans for purchasing grain to save the dying, providing agricultural loans, and assisting livelihoods. The report on the situation in Zhide County was extremely concise and detailed, making it unbearable to read. It is hereby disclosed, hoping that benevolent people will work together to provide relief.</p>
<p>To Xu Jinglao of the Shanghai Renji Hall Relief Committee and all the great philanthropists in Shanghai,</p>
<p>I have heard that the righteousness of disaster relief is like putting out a fire, and the method of providing relief is even more important than saving the dying. Therefore, to save the disaster-stricken people who are on the verge of death, without precise planning and swift action, it is impossible to turn death into life and reverse the great catastrophe. I, Mian, was ordered to come to Anhui to investigate the disaster situation. According to statistics, the number of disaster-stricken counties has reached as many as forty-nine. Among them, Zhide is the most severely affected. Because Zhide borders Pengze, Fuliang, Poyang, and other counties in northern Jiangxi, it has little land and many mountains, and has always been known as a poor area. Since the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic, the communists have spread throughout the county, looting food and slaughtering even the village dogs. In the summer of the 23rd year of the Republic, they approached the county seat, and their momentum became even more rampant. After repeated suppression, they have not been eradicated. The people have fallen into displacement and suffered the most severely. Coupled with the rampant drought, the land is barren. Old reserves are exhausted, and new harvests are nonexistent. The young and strong have already taken risks, and the old and weak have filled the ditches. Some have been burned and looted by bandits and suffered from drought, resulting in the destruction of their houses. They have freed themselves to return, while others have suffered severely from drought and are on the verge of starvation, resulting in a continuous stream of people on the road, seeking food in other towns. All of them are barely clinging to life, on the verge of death. According to statistics, there are about 56,000 people in total. These large numbers of disaster-stricken people have already become starving corpses, exposed to the wind and dew. Observing their tragic situation, some are eating grass roots, tree bark, or Guanyin flour, resulting in poisoning and bloating to death. Some families are starving and cannot borrow money, resulting in mutual cannibalism. Some are selling their sons and daughters, with each child selling for only a few dollars, resulting in the separation of flesh and blood, and the sound of crying is miserable. And the elderly and sick, suffering from hunger and cold, are collapsing on the road, unable to be buried. The sights are too horrible to bear.</p>
<p>Such a combination of banditry and drought, with the disaster not yet over, is truly a rare disaster that has not been seen in recent decades. I believe that the future is long and the great difficulty is behind us. Those who are hungry are barely clinging to life, and those who are about to die will eventually not be willing to sit and die. It will be seen that when they can no longer bear it, they will rise up and join the bandits, which will inevitably lead to the tragedy of disaster-stricken people becoming bandits and bandits becoming disaster-stricken people. The year is already coming to an end, and collapse is to be feared. Next year's spring plowing will have no seeds, and the famine can be predicted. The current situation is so serious, and the hidden dangers are growing so deeply. The disaster machine will be triggered at any moment, like a prairie fire. Looking ahead, it is chilling and frightening. I am not trying to be alarmist. Therefore, under these circumstances, saving the dying is the most urgent priority, followed by assisting livelihoods. Saving the dying is nothing more than urgent relief, while assisting livelihoods is mainly agricultural loans. Urgent relief is a temporary solution, temporarily saving people from death, while agricultural loans are a fundamental solution, sufficient to support the livelihoods of the coming year. The so-called treatment of both the symptoms and the root cause is actually the way to eliminate bandits. Only when the bandits are eliminated can the people be at peace, and only when the people are at peace can the country be governed.</p>
<p>Although we have received relief from various parties, it is like a drop in the bucket, and it is difficult to expect relief. I deeply believe that financial resources are exhausted, and it is difficult to raise money. Without precise planning, how can we save such a widespread and extraordinary disaster? I have been thinking hard day and night, not even having time to eat or sleep. I plan to first raise funds in the short term to purchase grain and provide urgent relief to save the dying, and then, depending on the amount of additional funds raised, provide agricultural loans to assist livelihoods. The main point of urgent relief is to use funds wisely and for a long period of time, saving more people, so that it can be effective. I plan to follow this principle, starting from now until the wheat season in early summer next year, for a long-term relief period of three months, so that those who are barely clinging to life can continue to exist and not abandon spring plowing. The method is to distribute one catty of red grain per person per day, regardless of age. This amounts to 28,000 catties of grain per day, 840,000 catties of grain per month, and a total of 2.5 million catties of grain in three months. According to the market price of 6 yuan per shi of Bengbu rice, with each shi being 200 catties, this amounts to 140 shi of Bengbu rice per day, costing 840 yuan. Each month, this amounts to 4,200 shi of grain, costing 25,200 yuan. In three months, this amounts to 12,600 shi of grain, totaling 75,600 yuan. In this way, for a period of three months, more than 56,000 people can be saved, and the funds used are very small. On average, each person only receives a few yuan, which can save their lives. There is truly a wonderful effect of using minimal funds to achieve great results. There is no better plan than this. Once this plan is implemented, if donations are abundant, reaching more than 75,000 yuan, the remaining funds can be used to provide agricultural loans, so that they can purchase seeds, plowing cattle, and farm tools, and plant in time to support their livelihoods for a year, so as to avoid disaster on top of disaster, leading to a major change, to the point of being irreparable. As for the procedures for providing relief and the methods for agricultural loans, I will explain them in detail later. The matter is urgent and fleeting, and the opportunity to do good is nowhere to be found. I have always admired the great philanthropists for their willingness to provide relief to the masses, regardless of regional boundaries. Therefore, I dare to express my sincerity and appeal on behalf of the 56,000 disaster-stricken people, hoping that the great philanthropists will be moved by the current situation and worry about the future, and will definitely not give way to others, but will generously donate and widely solicit donations, gathering together to complete this concrete plan. Then, the field of blessings will be widely sown, and the merits will be boundless. Heaven's will can be reversed, and human disasters can be avoided. There will truly be an inconceivable feeling of summoning auspiciousness and harmony. I respectfully kowtow nine times on behalf of the 56,000 disaster-stricken people, and earnestly hope that you will show great compassion and help to make this happen. I cannot express my urgent hope enough.</p>
<p>Hong Mian kowtows.</p>

<p>Appeal of the Murderer in the Tang Jiapeng Case</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Judgment</h3>
<p>In Addition to Murder, an Additional Charge of Possession of Firearms</p>
<p>The Court Transferred a Document to Wuchang to Investigate the Facts of Wang's Crime</p>
<p>After Tang Jiapeng, also known as Ah Yu, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was assassinated in front of the Great World at around 1:00 AM on June 18 of the 22nd year of the Republic, Jin Jiujin, the detective superintendent of the French Concession Police, and detectives from a special agency arrested the murderers, Zhang Xiaosizi (i.e. Tinggui) from Funing and Zhao Guangfu from Yangzhou, one after another, and retrieved a pistol used by Zhao to kill Tang, and sent them to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for premeditated murder. After the trial concluded, Zhang Xiaosizi was sentenced to twenty years in prison and Zhao Guangfu was sentenced to life imprisonment, and each was deprived of public rights for life. The two criminals were dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. As a result, the appeal was rejected and the original judgment was upheld. Zhang then no longer appealed, the sentence was finalized, and he was sent to prison. However, Zhao was still unwilling to accept and appealed again to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire file and ruled that in addition to the original judgment on the murder, an additional charge of possession of firearms was added. The main text of the judgment stated that the original judgment regarding Zhao Guangfu's crime and sentence was revoked. Zhao Guangfu was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly premeditated murder and deprived of public rights. He was sentenced to one year in prison for intending to use the handgun for criminal purposes, and the sentence was to be served with life imprisonment. The handgun was confiscated. This judgment will be sent to the Second Branch of the High Court in the coming days for execution in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>In addition, based on Zhao's confession, the French Concession Police recently arrested Wang Xinggao, a major criminal from Funing who instigated the killing of Tang, and sent him to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Wang hired lawyers Yan Shen and Xingxia to defend him, denying that he had instigated the killing of Tang Jiapeng. At the time of the incident, he was the warden of the First Prison in Wuchang. The court has now transferred a document to the Wuchang Court for investigation. The trial will be held as soon as the Wuchang reply is received, and the date should not be far off.</p>
<h3>Woman Injured Suspiciously</h3>
<p>Refuses to Explain the Reason for the Injury</p>
<p>Some Say it was a Former Lover Seeking Revenge</p>
<p>Chen Heshang, a local man, is 34 years old and lives at 19 Dunheli, Latou Road, French Concession. His wife, Wang Lingli, from Ningbo, is 28 years old. Chen and Wang were originally living together. Chen Heshang was originally a chauffeur at the Huayang Automobile Company on Beidi Road, but is now unemployed. At 9:00 PM last night, Wang was holding a teapot and went to the Xingfa Teahouse at 298 Nongkou to brew tea. Wang put the teapot on the stove and went outside. The people in the teahouse saw that she was an acquaintance, so they did not ask any questions. Unexpectedly, Wang returned not long after, and they saw that her body was covered in blood stains and she was walking unsteadily. They were greatly surprised and asked her what had happened. She stammered and said that she had been stabbed in the gambling house. At this time, Chen Heshang also received the news and ran out of the house in a hurry. He saw that his wife's face was pale and she had lost all color. He questioned her about what had happened. She claimed that she had been stabbed in the gambling house. Chen reported to the police, who sent a car to take her to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's examination, it was found that she had four knife wounds, one on each breast and two on the upper back. The injuries were very serious. According to rumors, it is suspected that Wang's former lover came to seek revenge. The police are currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Two Charity Groups Invite Mei Lanfang to Perform Charity Plays</h3>
<p>Starting on the 14th at the Samsung Stage</p>
<p>Last summer's drought in Jiangsu and Zhejiang was extraordinarily severe, and relief was urgently needed. The Chinese Childhood Welfare Association also needed to raise funds for subsidies due to financial difficulties. Mei Lanfang happened to be passing through Shanghai on his way to Russia. The president of the association, Kong Xiangxi, and Zhang Renjie, Chu Minyi, Du Yuesheng, and others, requested Mei Lanfang to perform charity plays, and the proceeds from the tickets would be allocated to the two aforementioned charitable causes. It has been decided to hold the performances at the Samsung Stage for four consecutive evenings starting on February 14 (the eleventh day of the first lunar month). Famous amateur performers from Shanghai will also join in the performance. The selected plays are exceptionally wonderful. For example, on the first night, Mei Lanfang and Zhao Peixin will perform "Fen River Bay". On the second night, Chu Minyi will perform "Lamenting the Imperial Spirit" and Mei Lanfang will perform the full version of "The Dragon and Phoenix Bring Good Fortune". On the third night, Chu Minyi will perform "Assassinating the Liao" and Mei Lanfang will perform "Su San Released Under Escort". On the fourth night, Chu Minyi will perform "Caobiao Pass" and Mei Lanfang and Jin Shaoshan will perform "Farewell My Concubine". The ticket prices, excluding special seats, flower floors, and moon floors, are divided into four types: 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 2.5 yuan. Entertainment does not forget charity. At that time, the traffic will be busy and it will definitely be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>President Kong's Broadcast at the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>Celebration Meeting and Shanghai Infant Health Competition Held</p>
<p>The Children's Year will commence on April 4th of this year. The specific measures for holding the Children's Year have been carefully discussed and drafted by the Ministries of Education and Interior, and will soon be jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation nationwide. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Chinese National Child Welfare Association held a meeting of officers at noon yesterday (the 11th), and has assigned several specialists to earnestly prepare for the Association's own activities on the opening day of the Children's Year. In addition to participating in various activities of the Shanghai Children's Year Preparatory Committee together with various Shanghai institutions (Municipal Government, Education Bureau, Health Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Municipal Party Headquarters, Children's Welfare Association, etc.), the Association will also: (1) gather children from the Association's affiliated Tzu Yu Education Institute, Civilian Education Institute, and Tzu Yu Nursery on April 4th to hold a large-scale celebration meeting (to be prepared by Ms. Yao Shuwen and Ms. Wang Zhubao); (2) the Association's affiliated Tzu Yu Clinic will hold the Shanghai Infant Health Competition (to be prepared by Dr. Huang Huiguang, Dr. Liu Yide, Ms. Xia Shi, etc.); (3) on the eve of the opening day of the Children's Year, President Kong Xiangxi will deliver a speech at the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station [on the significance of holding the Children's Year]; (4) publish "A Message from the Chinese National Child Welfare Association to the National Compatriots on the Opening Day of the Children's Year" (to be drafted by Chen Zhengfan); (5) edit a "Children's Year Handbook" and suggest to the Central Children's Year Preparatory Committee that it be published jointly by the Chinese National Child Welfare Association and the Central Children's Year Preparatory Committee (to be edited by Chen Zhengfan); (6) be responsible for assisting Shanghai newspapers in editing a "Special Issue for the Opening of Children's Year and Children's Day Celebrations." In addition to the existing inscriptions and congratulatory messages received from various important figures in the National Government and prominent figures in society, it will continue to solicit essays, inscriptions, drawings, etc., from various important figures, celebrities, and scholars to achieve perfection and completeness (to be edited by Chen Zhengfan); (7) other unfinished matters will be planned by Chen Tiesheng, Wang Guanyi, Chen Zhengfan, etc. Furthermore, during the meeting of officers held by the Association on the 28th of last month, it was agreed in principle to make the following four suggestions to the National Government: (1) on the opening day of the Children's Year, the Chairman of the National Government should issue a declaration of the Children's Year to express the government's determination to protect children; (2) on the opening day of the Children's Year, the chief administrative officers of the capital and various parts of the country should hold ceremonies to inspect child welfare institutions, in order to show the importance attached to child welfare undertakings; (3) during the Children's Year, the government should specially allocate large sums of money (such as the Boxer Indemnity) to provide relief to homeless children throughout the country; (4) the Central Political Council should establish a Children's Welfare Committee (or add a Child Welfare Department to the Ministry of Interior) to guide, assist, and control child welfare undertakings throughout the country. However, because these four matters are of great importance and involve complex issues, it is still necessary to conduct research from a practical perspective. Therefore, the entire body elected Chen Tiesheng to consult with President Kong Xiangxi for a final decision. However, due to President Kong's recent minor illness, he has not yet been able to report the matter. It is expected that after President Kong's research and approval in the coming days, it will enter a stage of practical implementation.</p>

<p>The Original Site of the Bank of China on the Bund</p>
<h3>Changes in the Design of the New Building</h3>
<p>Reduction in the Number of Floors Due to Market Depression</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the original site of the Bank of China on Renji Road on the Bund is old and has been affected by the adjacent new construction projects, causing internal tilting. Therefore, the bank authorities planned to rebuild the tallest building in the Far East, a 28-story new building, and move entirely into the office at the intersection of Hankou Road and Sichuan Road during the Spring Festival holiday. A previous report stated that the bank, in view of the market downturn, was considering temporarily suspending construction. According to information obtained by reporters from reliable sources, the bank's new building was originally planned to be a 28-story building. However, due to the market depression, such a tall building is not needed, so the proposed design has been revised to reduce the number of floors to approximately ten. As for the construction project, it will not be suspended because the current office, which was moved to last year, is temporary and does not meet the needs.</p>
<h3>Second Day of the Shanghai Bank Agriculture Conference</h3>

<p>Lianyi Association of Vegetable Market Stallholders in the Second Special District</p>
<h3>Reply to the Letter from the French Concession Police Department</h3>
<p>Requesting Legal Protection of Members' Interests</p>
<p>Non-arbitrary Illegal Suppression or Deprivation</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Second Special District Vegetable Market Stallholders' Lianyi Association, its members have reported to the association that they have been repeatedly oppressed by contractors, who have illegally profited from them, resulting in insufficient income. There have been hundreds of cases of complaints. The association has been doing its best to legally protect the interests of its members. On the 28th of last month, it sent a letter to Mr. Chuan, the Director-General of the French Municipal Council, requesting the French authorities to crack down on contractors who illegally profit from them. However, no reply has been received. Recently, the French Concession Police Department suddenly sent a letter stating that the association was not allowed to be established, which was astonishing. The executive committee was immediately convened to hold an emergency meeting. They unanimously declared that a reply should be made to the letter. The letter is as follows: To the Director-General: On January 3rd and 30th of this year, we received your letters No. Ai and No. 1614, which stated: [After investigation, the establishment of the Second Special District Vegetable Market Stallholders' Lianyi Association in the French Concession is not permitted. The association's officers are prohibited from exerting pressure and extorting donations from stallholders in the French Concession.] After investigation, the purpose of our association's organization is to exchange knowledge between China and France. It was approved by the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Nationalist Party and reported to your office for the record. We are writing to raise three points for your detailed explanation: (1) The area of our association is within the scope of the Third Special District. Because the members have been repeatedly oppressed and defrauded of money by contractors, and in view of the organization of various groups such as the Citizens' Union in the French Concession, our association was legally established with the approval of the Party Department in order to seek protection. Now your letter states [the establishment is not permitted in the French Concession]. May we ask what legal basis is there for not permitting it? It seems that Chinese legal groups are allowed to establish themselves in the French Concession, while our association is an exception. This is doubt one. (2) [The association's officers are exerting pressure and extorting donations from stallholders in the French Concession.] Since its establishment, our association has not collected any donations. How can the association's officers be exerting pressure and extorting donations from stallholders who are not members in the French Concession? There is no evidence for this. It is all based on speculation. We think governments of all countries would not do this. This is doubt two. (3) The purpose of our association is to assist the French Municipal Council in facilitating the management of various vegetable market stalls and to protect the interests of the stallholders who are members, to crack down on illegal contractors, and to prevent oppression and illegal profits. Therefore, on the 28th of last month, we sent a letter to Mr. Chuan, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, requesting the crackdown on oppression and illegal profits by contractors. However, no reply has been received. All of our association's members are taxpayers in the French Concession. They are oppressed, and our association has certified that they have not received the obligation of taxpaying protection. Why should our association be ordered to be suppressed by your office? Upon checking the laws and regulations of the Republic of China, there is no such explicit provision. This is doubt three. We hope for an immediate clarification in order to dispel doubts and maintain public opinion. We are looking forward to it.</p>

<h3>Pihan Institute's Finances Are Critically Deficient</h3>
<p>Zhang Zixin, Director of the Pihan Institute in Southern Shanghai, reported to Wang Yiting and Huang Han'zhi, the chairmen of the Charity Groups Joint Association, yesterday, stating that the institute has been operating since December 1st of last year, and the number of people it shelters has been increasing day by day. There are now more than 2,900 people in the two institutes. Although efforts have been made to economize on expenses, the item of rice still requires about 25 stones at present. Including other expenses, the total is more than 18,000 yuan. Moreover, the spring cold is still severe, and it is difficult for the poor to leave the institute to seek a living on their own. If the end is delayed, such as extending it by one month, it will require 9,000 yuan. The current balance is only one million yuan, which is insufficient for the purpose, and the difference is very large. The income and expenditure semi-monthly report has been prepared and submitted for your review, and we earnestly request prompt relief to benefit the poor and do great deeds. It is reported that the two chairmen, Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi, have been raising funds from all sides in recent days.

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Two Lines of Approach to Japan (Continued) Lin Bosheng</h3>
<p>...After Reading Xu Daolin's [A Review of Sino-Japanese Relations]...</p>
<p>Finally, let me add a few words.</p>
<p>In one passage, Xu Wen mentions the opinion paper published by Chiang Kai-shek in January 1932, in which his diplomatic stance towards Japan was summarized in twelve characters: [No severance of relations, no declaration of war, no peace talks, no treaty signing]. Mr. Xu believes that although it is [not thorough], it [cannot be denied that this policy is a relatively unfeasible method, because countries with vastly unequal national power and military strength can only use this policy and strategy to deal with each other]. I believe that the eight characters [Negotiate on one hand, resist on the other] proposed by Wang Jingwei after the September 18th Incident also convey the same meaning. At the time, he advocated resisting on one hand because he saw that the Northeast garrison did not resist, and he advocated negotiating on one hand because he saw that the whole country advocated not negotiating. Compared side by side, there is no difference. The only difference is that [No severance of relations, no declaration of war, no peace talks, no treaty signing] establishes the scope of diplomatic and military policy from a passive perspective, while [Negotiate on one hand, resist on the other] points out the direction of diplomatic and military policy from a positive perspective. Why is it said to be a method among unfeasible methods? Because with this approach, no one dares to say that they have any certainty of success, but in fact, it has to be done arduously.</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, under the leadership of Wang Jingwei and Zhuang Wenjie, the political and military authorities, China has been following this path completely.</p>
<p>The meaning of negotiation and resistance has been mentioned above. Negotiation means seeking a solution under extreme tolerance, and resistance means that when tolerance is no longer possible and concessions cannot be made, for the sake of territorial sovereignty and the lives and property of the people, we must rise up for legitimate defense. During the Songhu War, Japan used force, which had reached the point where tolerance was no longer possible and concessions could not be made, so we tried our best to resist. After the resistance failed, we were responsible for negotiating and signing the Songhu Armistice Agreement. This is the process of negotiation and resistance. During the North China War, Japan used force again; it had also reached the point where tolerance was no longer possible and concessions could not be made; so we tried our best to resist. After the resistance failed, we were responsible for negotiating and signing the Tanggu Truce. This is also the process of negotiation and resistance. As for appealing to the League of Nations, the arrival of the League of Nations Investigation Team in China, the drafting of the Lytton Report, and the League of Nations resolution recognizing Japan as an aggressor and the puppet organization as a puppet, all of which gave China a fair sympathy, were also part of the negotiation process. Naturally, land was lost due to non-resistance in the past, and land is now lost due to resistance. Since negotiation is necessary anyway, it seems that there was no need to resist in the first place. Since we resisted, it seems that we should not have negotiated later. Looking back on the matter, we cannot say that this approach is thorough, but considering the circumstances of the day, we cannot deny that this approach was forced by circumstances. With the current national strength, resistance will inevitably fail, who doesn't know this? Knowing it and still resisting is precisely a firm expression of fighting for the country's personality and seeking the nation's survival. Success or failure is not its purpose. It is known that resistance and negotiation seem to be contradictory, but in fact, they are complementary. Resistance leads to negotiation, and the more effective the resistance, the more hopeful the negotiation. As for the resistance, there is no follow-up internally and no foreign aid externally. In the end, negotiation is known to be out of desperation. On January 23rd last year, Mr. Wang made a political report at the fourth plenary session of the fourth session of the Central Executive Committee, in which he made an analogy. He said, what should be the first step if a village encounters bandits who break into the gate in the middle of the night? Naturally, it is to hold the second gate firmly, and the second step is to beat the gong to call for help. When the gong rings and reinforcements do not arrive, and the gate has been lost, and it seems that even the second gate cannot be defended, what should be done at that time? In order to defend the second gate, it is necessary to stop the gong and plan how to strengthen the defense inside the second gate and how to ease the attack outside the second gate. From the Songhu Armistice Agreement to the Tanggu Truce, the situation is exactly like this. Until today, the situation in China is still like this.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that for the past three years, China has been following the second path I mentioned above.</p>
<p>During these three years, China's national lifeline has gone through countless crises, the people of the whole country have suffered countless sacrifices, and the government authorities have tasted countless hardships before reaching today.</p>
<p>After today, will China continue to adhere to the Wang-Chiang line that has remained unchanged for the past three years? Or will there be other paths?</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>As I was writing this, I just received Tokyo dispatches from the Associated Press and Reuters, which said that the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun published a long article by the newspaper's political correspondent on January 29, stating the fundamental principles of Japan's policy toward China. It is expected that the Japanese government will use these principles as the basis, hoping that China will abandon its old traditional policy of attacking and making friends from afar, and said that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will pay attention to the following points to determine its new policy toward China:</p>
<p>(1) Maintain the integrity of China's territory, hoping that the first step is to suppress the communist bandits and sweep away all anti-foreign movements.</p>
<p>(2) Formal negotiations to restore normal relations between China and Japan.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese government will continue not to interfere in China's internal affairs and will remain neutral in China's party struggles, but if there is one person in China who is willing and able to assume full responsibility for governing China, Japan is prepared to expand its political, military, economic and other assistance to him.</p>
<p>(4) Japan is willing to exchange ambassadors with China and conclude a Sino-Japanese agreement in accordance with the Japan-[Manchukuo] agreement, but China must realize that China and Japan are interdependent and recognize the importance of their position in the peace of the Far East, and not rely solely on Europe and the United States. (5) Japan is willing to conclude another agreement with China on Far Eastern political issues, because Japan no longer recognizes the principle of multilateral conventions such as the Nine-Power Treaty that allows third parties to participate. (6) Regarding Far Eastern military issues, Japan hopes that China will promise not to seek assistance from the League of Nations again, and it is not impossible to withdraw from the League of Nations, and to replace European and American advisors with Japanese advisors.</p>
<p>(7) Japan believes that the organization of a Sino-[Manchukuo]-Japanese group is an extremely important move, and Japan is prepared to provide China with expanded financial assistance for this.</p>
<p>(8) If China can express its sincerity regarding the above points, Japan is prepared to change the North China Armistice Agreement into a permanent treaty and establish a neutral zone between China and [Manchukuo]. (9) Japan believes that negotiations on a possible Sino-Japanese treaty should begin six months after March 27, when Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will take effect.</p>
<p>Comparing this record with Foreign Minister Hirota's recent speech in the Japanese parliament, it is not difficult to see what the meaning of Japan's so-called change in policy toward China is. It seems necessary to add a few words to the Japanese.</p>
<p>If Japan truly has the sincerity to abandon military aggression, open up a new Sino-Japanese situation, and restore normal diplomatic relations, it will have only benefits and no harm to Japan itself, to East Asian peace, and even to world peace. I believe that the Chinese side should also not be indecisive and should consider it in accordance with established policies. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>First, in terms of the international situation, from the agreement between France and Italy at the beginning of this year, through the Saar plebiscite to the recent visit of Austrian Prime Minister Goering to Poland and the joint declaration of Britain and France, a series of international events reflect the international crisis everywhere, reflect the life of anxiety that European countries are living under so-called armed peace, and at the same time show the psychology of European countries' people's aversion to war everywhere. Show the painstaking efforts and efforts of European governments to avoid war (or at least delay war) and maintain peace. The European situation can be said to have a temporary possibility of peace. What is most threatening to world peace is East Asia, and what is most threatening to East Asian peace is Japan. If we add it up, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will be completed in March of this year, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Naval Agreement have already been notified of their abolition in December of last year, then we can understand that today's Japan is taking a dead end that threatens world peace (Note). It is exactly the so-called crucial moment to start a war, and it is also the moment to maintain peace. It is also the so-called rein in at the edge of the cliff. The Japanese people, from the poor masses to the important ministers, scholars, elders, and soldiers, should all be calm and think carefully at this time for the ultimate interests of Japan, for the peace of East Asia, and for world peace. This is one.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of Sino-Japanese relations, there is no need to mention those words about being of the same race and the same culture. Just from an economic point of view, Japan is an advanced industrial country, and China is a vast agricultural country. Japan is an island country, and China is a continental country. Under the principle of international division of labor, the economic relations between China and Japan cannot be separated or divided. It must be known that military aggression and political control are the methods used by militarists in the 18th and 19th centuries. This era has passed. The division of labor and connection between countries is the inevitable result of the development of world economic activities, especially the inevitable process of group economies. Under this trend, all deformed combinations will inevitably disintegrate and be replaced by equal and naturally developed division of labor and connections. As a method, the result must be a loss outweighs the gains. Just calculate the strength spent in occupying the Northeast and the conflict between colonial capital and imperial capital created in the Northeast in the past two or three years to understand. On the Chinese side, it should also be known that although the division of labor and connection between countries and economic aggression are very similar, they are not completely indistinguishable. We cannot say that before China has achieved an equal status and a considerable national strength, a Japanese yen, a British pound, or a US dollar in China will not contain the meaning of aggression, but we cannot say that a British pound invades the United States when it arrives in New York, or a US dollar invades Britain when it arrives in London. This statement seems ridiculous, but it can also be seen that the relationship between countries is like differential and integral calculus, the more divided, the more subtle, the closer the integration, the complex, and it is by no means a simple printed arithmetic formula of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division that can be solved. The so-called equal status and the so-called national strength cannot be achieved overnight, nor can they be estimated by simply comparing that one thing. It all depends on the development of the situation to make a judgment. Therefore, I personally believe that under this principle, there is a possibility and necessity to consider the economic relations between China and Japan. This is two.</p>
<p>What should be paid attention to here:</p>
<p>First, as for the so-called formal negotiations to restore normal relations between China and Japan, if the Japanese side is indeed sincere, the Chinese government should be open and honest based on the established policy, without so-called abandoning policies or changing directions.</p>
<p>Second, non-recognition of the puppet Manchukuo is an iron rule that the Chinese government and people unanimously abide by. There is no room for negotiation at all for those who violate this iron rule or are suspected of factually or formally recognizing the puppet state.</p>
<p>Third, under the principle of freedom and equality, the Chinese government can give appropriate consideration to the economic relations between China and Japan, but this consideration is entirely based on the economic and geographical relations between China and Japan. The so-called Sino-"Manchukuo"-Japanese group can be said to be the most ridiculous.</p>
<p>Fourth, the so-called consideration of economic relations between the two countries is based on the principle of freedom and equality, which absolutely cannot contain any exclusive or exclusive nature. Under the same principle, China has its own economic relations with European and American countries. In other words, China must still adhere to the established policy of not uniting with Europe and the United States to exclude Japan, nor uniting with Japan to exclude Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Fifth, the so-called consideration of economic relations between the two countries clearly means economy, which absolutely cannot be attached to any political or military conditions. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun claimed that if there is one person in China who is willing and able to assume full responsibility for governing China, Japan is prepared to expand its political, economic, military and other assistance to him. This is completely the biggest mistake in Japan's traditional thinking toward China. I dare to tell the Japanese that China under the rule of the Kuomintang will never have Yuan Shikai first, to sign the 21 Articles in disguise, and China will never be the second Korea, to sign the so-called "annexation of Korea" agreement in disguise. Japan does not need to entice us with this again. If China needs the assistance of Japan, no matter in which aspect, it must be due to China's autonomy, and secondly, it must be based on the needs of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>In other words, it is very good if Japan has the sincerity to break the deadlock between China and Japan, but judging from the records of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, the traditional mistakes and ideas of the Japanese have not been eliminated, which is a great regret.

<p>The literature we need now is the bread that can fill our bellies, not luxuries solely for decoration.</p>

<p>Modern society is like a kaleidoscope, from the mansions of the rich and powerful to the slums of the poor; from the stench of wine and meat in the vermilion gates to the frozen bones on the road; from scientific foreign PhDs and masters to theocratic monks and nuns, everything is available.</p>
<h3>Lost Husband and Finger</h3>
<p>— Wang Yun</p>
<p>The gambling atmosphere in Xinhui is very strong, with gambling dens of all sizes spread throughout the cities and villages. Especially in these first few days of the year, those with a Liu Panlong addiction are already itching to try, regardless of whether they will lose their homes, they all go to the gambling dens to satisfy their gambling cravings.</p>
<p>A farmer named Zhang from the countryside is a loyal believer of the gambling god Bodhisattva, losing more as he gambles, and gambling more as he loses, with the appearance of "not giving up until reaching the Yellow River." His wife, Wu, repeatedly pleaded bitterly, shedding tears, but he treated his wife's words as wind passing by his ears. As soon as he heard there was a gambling den somewhere, he eagerly rushed to gamble, not hesitating to pawn clothes and belongings to pay homage to his gambling expenses.</p>
<p>One day, he took more than three yuan of gambling money to the Shalu Market gambling den to gamble. By the end of the gambling session, not only was his pocket empty, but he also owed more than ten yuan in bad debts. He had no way to pay it off. The gamblers were in an uproar and imprisoned Zhang in a dark room, inflicting severe beatings on him. Zhang, unable to bear the pain, begged to pay it off within three days and asked a familiar gambling friend to guarantee it before he was released and returned home.</p>
<p>Two days later, Zhang invited his wife to go to Xiaogang Market to shop. Wu did not suspect anything and went with a basket. Who knew that as soon as they arrived at Xiaogang Market, someone detained Wu and showed her her husband's note, only then did she realize that her husband had sold Wu to Li of Xiaogang as a concubine for a price of thirty yuan to repay his gambling debts.</p>
<p>Zhang obtained the money from the sale and went to Shalu Market, wanting to try his luck again after repaying his debts. Who knew that his luck was not good, and he lost every battle. The money in his pocket became "empty again." After returning home, he was unusually depressed. He accidentally looked up and saw Wu's photo still hanging on the wall—he thought that the small portrait was still there, but the person had already become a commodity. At that moment, grief arose from within, and his spirit suffered a major shock. He rushed into the kitchen and cut off his index finger with a kitchen knife. Blood flowed like a stream, and he fainted. Neighbors found out and, after waking him up, sent him to the hospital. Isn't the outcome of a gambler losing his wife and finger?</p>
<h3>Talking About Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>"Black eyes seeing silver," this saying is outdated now, because snow-white silver dollars are rarely circulating in the current market. Nine out of ten things that come from the east hand to the west hand are colorful banknotes.</p>
<p>Hygienists say that "banknotes" are the easiest things to spread infectious diseases, because when banknotes pass through the hands of those with infectious diseases, bacteria will attach to the banknotes and be transmitted to those without infectious diseases through the medium of banknotes. But even though that's what they say, I have never seen any hygienist refuse to accept unsterilized banknotes. And at the same time, I have never found any banknotes discarded by hygienists on the street.</p>
<p>I have a friend who has a special interest in banknotes. Every banknote that passes through his hands has a small stamp or signature on the corner. He is a salaried worker with a monthly income of a little over one hundred yuan, but according to him, after stamping and signing for three years, only one ten-yuan note and three five-yuan notes have passed through his hands a second time. The rest, once used, have never been seen again.</p>
<p>In the interior, in places where transportation is not very convenient, there is still a habit of using only ×× bank notes and refusing to use other bank notes, even though other banks are as reliable as ×× bank in Shanghai, but in the interior, it is somewhat different. This is just like the "foreign bank notes are most popular" that used to be popular in Shanghai, which is equally incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>Miss Tang</h3>
<p>— Wang Xikeng</p>
<p>Anyone who knows Miss Tang must admit that she is a stunner, a lovely person.</p>
<p>Miss Tang is slender, not too tall, not too short, with a well-proportioned figure, wearing a well-fitting fashion, walking gracefully with small steps, showing that she is a complete modern woman; and even more so, she has a slightly yellowish and peach-colored oval face, dark hair, trimmed moth eyebrows, moist and bright autumn waves, and thin red lips, which is truly very beautiful, very beautiful.</p>
<p>And that's not all. Miss Tang also has a special advantage; that is, she treats people very kindly, always smiling before speaking, and showing goodwill to everyone. Originally, Miss Tang's beautiful appearance was already very moving; what's more, on those tender and rosy cheeks, there are two shallow dimples, and her thin red lips are slightly upturned, revealing two rows of neat jade teeth, what a soul-stirring smiling face.</p>
<p>Really, anyone who has experienced Miss Tang's smile feels that this smile is subtle, charming, and contains infinite depth and mystery. However, it is also in her shallow dimples that I don't know how many young people have been intoxicated and how many patriots have been turned upside down!</p>
<p>But then again, although Miss Tang's actions are so gentle and her expression is so kind, she also has times when she dislikes people. Because, to say nothing else, if you speak bluntly and don't suit her, she will wrinkle her eyebrows and scold you in a delicate and coquettish voice, "You dead Jiangbei old man."</p>

<h3>Dog Obsession and Dogs</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The Mystery of Women's Love for Dogs</p>
<p>In European and American countries, almost every woman in every family has more than one pet dog. These women may have servants all over the house and are usually unwilling to do any housework themselves, but they personally take care of the dog's food, bathing, etc. Their love for dogs is greater than their love for their husbands. When they are in the mood, they hug their beloved dogs and give them a few kisses. Moreover, the habit of kissing dogs is more common among women than men. Those young girls are unwilling to kiss men casually, but they are happy to kiss the dogs they keep without stopping. Isn't this a riddle that we can't figure out?</p>
<p>Kissing Dogs Spreads Swelling Disease</p>
<p>A doctor in the Westminster district of England once discovered a woman who died from kissing dogs often. This woman had a habit of always kissing her dogs non-stop when she fed them. As a result, she fell ill and could not be saved. The doctor at the Red Cross Hospital, after examining her with X-rays, found that she had a hydatid cyst in her abdomen. This cyst is formed by the eggs of small worms from the dog's body entering the human body. Therefore, it proves that she contracted this germ because she often kissed dogs. Moreover, there are many dog owners who have hydatid cysts in their abdomens from kissing dogs!</p>
<p>Dog Owner Arrested Because of Dog</p>
<p>Once, a person committed a crime. He was a dog lover, and the dog he kept was almost inseparable from him every day. One day, he and another friend were sitting next to the stove, and his dog was also with them. The detectives arrived, but the detectives only knew that he had a dog and did not recognize him. It was impossible to prove which of the two was the criminal at the time. The clever detective thought for a moment and came up with a plan. He went over and deliberately kicked the dog. The dog owner, seeing his beloved dog being kicked, immediately stood up to reason with the person. However, the detective immediately pulled out a pistol and captured the wanted criminal.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Remote Place, Light Official, Distant Strong Commander; Hua Hall, Grand Banquet, Outside, a Pitiful Worm</p>
<p>Among them, the one with the loudest laughter was County Magistrate Zhou Yourong. I only heard him say loudly: Since I am not an official that the imperial court cherishes very much, then I will not accept the insignificant reputation of the local community. Hahaha! His face was facing the window, and just looking at the sweat dripping from his forehead, one could imagine his heroic feelings. In fact, it was not just him, all the people present had red faces. At this time, the dish being served was fried pork chops. This grand meal in Xi'an was originally no different from eating Chinese food in a Western style. The Western restaurant in Little Western Paradise did not prepare large plates for serving dishes, but rather increased the number of people to distribute the plates of pork chops to the guests, two plates at a time. Probably the pork chops were not fried very well, and the people eating them had to work hard to cut them, so the sound of knives and forks hitting the plates was very lively. Zhang Jiefu saw it from outside the window and thought to himself, eating Western food like this is really just showing off. Wherever there is such a show, Director Gao must be inside, but I don't know which one he is. As he was thinking this, he had to stretch his neck and look inside. Just at this moment, a gust of flying sand came down from the eaves, filling his neck with a lot of dust. He took two steps back and looked at the sky, but it was already dark and moonless, and the wind was whistling over his head. He also found it funny that a person from the East would never have seen people eating Western food, standing outside the window and forgetting everything. Isn't this a joke? Looking distantly into the glass window, the people eating the big meal were having a lively time. At the same time, a strange sound was heard in his ears. But this was not the sound of laughter, but the sound of sobbing, carried by the wind. There was a crying sound in this Little Western Paradise, which was naturally something to pay attention to, and he couldn't help but follow the sound. (131)</p>
<h3>Misty Records of Royal Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>For example, at this moment, Her Old Highness is discussing the affairs of Tongzhi with me. At this time, what she says can really be said to come from the bottom of her heart, and her attitude is even more infinitely solemn and earnest. If I don't listen with a very concerned and moved expression, or do anything that would make her unhappy, then don't even think about hoping that she can forgive me! Even if I spend my whole life atoning for my sins, kneeling under her feet without leaving for a moment, she will definitely not forgive me! In this way, doesn't she become a terrible madman? No, no, others may not be able to understand her true nature, but I have at least realized in my feelings the reason why her personality is so special, there is really a driving force; what is this driving force? This can be explained in two words, namely [pain].</p>
<p>Indeed, her position, her power, and all her material enjoyment can be said to be enough to make her happy, but how can her inner pain be remedied? Statistics show that her life is almost filled with all kinds of disappointments and hardships. When she was young, she was like a fresh flower about to bloom, very beautiful, very lively, and her heart was very satisfied to focus on Ronglu, but unexpectedly she was selected into the palace and became the concubine of Xianfeng, forcibly throwing her sweetheart aside, which was already very heartbreaking! In addition, Xianfeng was a very昏庸rough person who did not know how to be gentle with her. He always embraced the principle of 博愛and wanted to take advantage of every woman with a little beauty, so he did not have much time to spend on her; what comfort did he give her? Only one son, and this son died young at the age of weak crown. (241)</p>

<p>Education News: The Geng Indemnity Funds are Used to Launch New Educational Undertakings by the Ministry of Education</p>
<h3>Forming a Committee with Various Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations to Implement</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has Drafted Measures to Subsidize Volunteer Education, Vocational Education, and Establish National University Research Institutes</p>
<p>Nanjing Special Dispatch: According to reports, the third joint meeting of the Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations resolved to jointly launch new educational undertakings. Yesterday, according to the heads of the Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations, the content of this case differs slightly from the Beijing telegram reported on the 7th. The third joint meeting of the Geng Indemnity Fund resolved that the Sino-American, Sino-British, Sino-French, and Sino-Belgian Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations should jointly raise 1.1 million national currency annually, starting in the 24th year, for a period of three years, to launch the following educational undertakings: (1) 800,000 yuan will be used as subsidies to promote compulsory education. At the same time, the government should allocate a corresponding amount from the central financial budget for the 24th year as subsidies for compulsory education. (2) 150,000 yuan will be used to reward and assist vocational education throughout the country, and 150,000 yuan will be used to subsidize national universities in establishing research institutes. (3) The detailed measures for the above undertakings will be discussed and implemented by the Ministry of Education and the organizing committees of the various Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations in June of the 24th year. Before the establishment of the committee, the Ministry of Education will draft measures and notify the various Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations. Yesterday, the various Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations simultaneously received the three measures drafted by the Ministry of Education to promote compulsory education, vocational education, and establish university research institutes, requesting the various Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations to provide support, and stating that in the past, the funds from the Geng Indemnity Fund for educational and cultural undertakings were mostly used for higher education, while this time, except for a small part used for higher education, the majority will be used for compulsory education and vocational education. In the past, the Geng Indemnity Fund was mostly used to subsidize urban education undertakings in the interior, while this time, the subsidies will be extended to border education undertakings. As for the distribution of the burden of this fund among the four Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations of the United States, Britain, France, and Belgium, China and the United States will contribute 400,000 yuan, China and Britain 300,000 yuan, China and France 150,000 yuan, and China and Belgium 250,000 yuan, totaling 1.1 million yuan annually. The draft of the three measures proposed by the Ministry of Education is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Outline of Measures to Subsidize the Promotion of Compulsory Education: From the 24th year to the 26th year, the Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations will allocate a total of 800,000 yuan annually as subsidies for compulsory education, in order to subsidize the government's promotion of compulsory education. Select one or two provinces from the remote provinces and select one or two cities from the municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan as the areas for the implementation of compulsory education with the aforementioned Geng Indemnity Fund subsidies. (2) Outline of Measures to Reward and Assist Vocational Education Throughout the Country: From the 20th year to the 26th year, the Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations will allocate a total of 150,000 yuan annually for rewarding and assisting vocational education. This subsidy will be limited to public or registered private vocational schools with excellent performance and meeting local needs. The number of schools receiving this subsidy should not be too large, in order to ensure that this subsidy can truly support a few model vocational schools. (3) Outline of Measures to Subsidize National Universities in Establishing Research Institutes: From the 24th year to the 26th year, the Geng Indemnity Fund Organizations will allocate a total of 150,000 yuan annually to subsidize two or three national universities in establishing research institutes. The universities receiving this subsidy will be designated after reference to the original proposal of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>General Evaluation Report of the National Labor Exhibition (4)</h3>
<p>(G) Achievements in Sewing and Embroidery</p>
<p>1. General Evaluation</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the embroidery achievements from various provinces and cities are mostly exquisite, skillful, and lifelike. However, efforts should be made to make them popular, simple, and practical, so that the public has the ability to purchase and the opportunity to enjoy them. The manufacturing methods of sewing, weaving, white embroidery, and silk drawing are excellent, and the colors are beautiful, but there is very little expression in the cutting patterns for sewing. In the future, when learning to sew, more attention should be paid to cutting methods.</p>
<p>2. Detailed Evaluation</p>
<p>(1) Hangzhou Municipal Junior Girls' Vocational School of Home Economics and Commerce in Zhejiang Province has several oil painting embroideries with excellent needlework, color, and shadow lines, and the spirit of the characters is also good. The embroidery is completely done with fine threads, thin and dense, and very beautiful, and can only be made by those who have studied it thoroughly. In addition, there are also various sewing, weaving, and specimen picture frames, which can also be used for reference by those who study art.</p>
<p>(2) The random needle embroidery of Danyang Private Zhengze Girls' Vocational High School in Jiangsu Province is said to have been developed after more than ten years of research and is a different kind of needlework. The embroidered items are extremely exquisite, lifelike, and have elegant colors.</p>
<p>(3) The four cutting practice books of Nanjing Municipal Vocational Supplementary School contain very detailed cutting methods. Sewing in schools in various provinces pays attention to needlework but neglects cutting, because needlework is often easier than cutting. It should be known that learning to make clothes starts with sewing, but it is only considered complete after understanding the manufacturing method. Therefore, attention must be paid to cutting. The school's cutting practice book contains detailed clothing patterns and dimensions, showing that they usually pay great attention to cutting. The four cross-stitch embroideries of the Municipal No. 1 High School, although slightly rough, have a unique style with landscape colors like paintings. The embroidery method is also different from others, and other schools also use this embroidery method with commendable results.</p>
<p>(4) Shanghai Municipal Wuben Girls' High School exports a lot, among which the knitting method of children's woolen clothes is the most excellent, and the edging colors are also harmonious, with a lot of artistic significance.</p>
<p>(5) Qingdao has a large quantity and variety, among which the Municipal Girls' High School and Private Sheng Gong Girls' High School have better results.</p>
<p>(7) Fuzhou Vocational High School of Fujian Province has many kinds of embroidery, and the spirit, color, and light are also quite beautiful. Xiamen Vocational High School of Fujian Province has many sewing products, among which the girls' dress-like skirts and vest-like skirts have the most elegant colors and are also well-made, suitable for children. (8) The pinched cotton flower tiger of the Municipal No. 1 Girls' High School in Hankou, Hubei Province, has good spirit and color and has artistic value.</p>
<p>(9) Xiang embroidery has formed its own school in the embroidery world of our country and has been widely spread in recent years. At this exhibition, the female students of the province have the most achievements, and Xiang embroidery is especially characteristic. The embroidered portraits, landscapes, flowers, and calligraphy of famous artists are mostly delicate and lifelike and are quite commendable.</p>
<p>(10) Guangdong Private Guangdong Girls' Vocational School has a pair of cold embroidery picture frames, in which the flowers are made of down or cotton, with bright colors and lifelike leaves. The manufacturing method is simple and seems to be more labor-saving than embroidery, and it is also a novel aspect of artistic products.</p>
<p>(11) Chahar, Sichuan, Suiyuan, Qinghai, Ningxia, etc., do not have many excellent products in Chahar and Sichuan provinces. Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Ningxia have few products and their quality is inferior to other provinces.</p>
<h3>Four. Evaluation of the Achievements of Labor Courses in Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>1. General Evaluation</p>
<p>(1) In this exhibition, there are not many types and quantities of products needed in rural areas, but the majority of rural teachers and primary schools in Lu, Ji, and Cha provinces can pay attention to this. A small number of schools in other provinces and cities can also use local agricultural by-products such as cattails, yellow grass, rice straw, wheat straw, hemp skin, reeds, willows, and mountain hawthorn to weave baskets, boxes, bags, mats, mats, ropes, plain cloth, dustpans, brooms, shoes, shoes, accounts, and other applied objects. This kind of teaching material requires very simple equipment, and the raw materials can be collected locally. Teaching children and rural teachers and students with this material, in addition to the educational value of labor training, can also help the family. Therefore, it can be a suitable part of the labor village for rural primary schools. Other tasks such as spinning, weaving, twisting hemp, silk reeling, repairing and manufacturing simple agricultural tools, building grass sheds, tailoring and dyeing rough cloth clothes, socks, etc. are not seen in the exhibits. Among them, spinning and weaving may be due to a lack of equipment, but washing clothes and mending socks do not depend on equipment and are also neglected, which is a major shortcoming of this exhibition.</p>
<p>(2) According to the teaching rules of the labor course standard, the teaching materials should be selected to suit the local and current situation. The organization of teaching materials should be interconnected, and practice should enable children to "use both hands and brains" and "do" in "practice." Among all the exhibits, the ones that have the above-mentioned spirit are all the products of the Fujian Provincial No. 2 Primary School and the soybean research unit products of the Central University Experimental School of Nanjing City, and the large unit design products of Xingzhongmen Primary School going to the front line. All the products of the Fujian Provincial No. 2 Primary School are carried out consistently with the design of a large unit, so the level of its products is from shallow to deep, the process is natural, the raw materials of the products are selected in an orderly manner, and it can pay attention to local products. The structure of the export is quite intentional, and the degree of production required is very suitable for the physical and mental health of children. The work of the products includes things made by individuals and things made by the whole school, which is quite in line with the main points of the curriculum. Moreover, the exhibition is in order, and a detailed report of the process is attached, so that visitors can examine its educational value in addition to appreciation. Therefore, it can be said to be one of its representative products. The soybean research unit products of the Central University Experimental School start with the research of natural science, followed by the practice of agricultural affairs such as sowing, cultivation, intertillage, and harvesting, followed by the practice of household affairs such as smoking beans, making soy sauce, making tofu milk, and making tofu, and then followed by the craft practice of making soybean growth specimens, pod models, etc. All the processes, in addition to detailed written records, also have photographic records of step-by-step practice items, and the results of the practice clearly show the facility status of applied curriculum standards and teaching rules. Therefore, it can also be said to be one of the representative products. The model of going to the front line designed by Xingzhongmen Primary School in Nanjing City is from "strengthening the body and saving the country" - a small sports field, "enriching national power" - several factory prototypes, "expanding air defense" - an airport, - a grand array of soldiers and horses, "army, navy, and air force" - aircraft carriers and warships, etc., "return my rivers and mountains" - a map of the four northeastern provinces is covered, all the troops, horses, guns, vehicles, planes, fleets, trains, and all military equipment, light and heavy, and other naval and air force prototypes are numerous, or they are cut into outlines by 马口假and pasted with different outline paper with images of characters and horses, or made of thick paper, or made of this bar, or using waste. Originally unsystematic small pieces, but they can form a very meaningful design model, and various operations are also commensurate with the level of children. The national defense products displayed throughout the field are the best of their kind.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Formulates General Rules for Senior Nurse Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 11th: The Ministry of Education has formulated provisional general rules for senior nurse vocational schools, totaling 19 articles, and issued an order on the 11th to all provincial and municipal education bureaus to order their subordinates to comply with them.</p>

<p>Nanjing, November 11th: The Ministry of Education issued an order on the 11th to the education bureaus of all provinces and municipalities, requesting them to send the recently compiled educational statistics publications to the Ministry, and if there are newly compiled statistics in the future, they should also be submitted at any time for reference.</p>
<h3>American Professor Hullcon of Central University Lectures on the Habits of Great People</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, November 11th) On the 11th anniversary week of Central University, newly hired American professor Hullcon lectured on the habits of great people, elaborating in detail, moving the audience.</p>
<h3>Ding Wenjiang Leaves Beijing for Ping</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, November 21st) Ding Wenjiang left for Ping on the evening of the 11th to attend the annual meeting of the Geology Society. After the meeting, he and Weng Wenhao will investigate the geology of Shanxi.</p>
<h3>President Mościcki's Thirty Years of Scientific Contributions</h3>
<p>(Warsaw Correspondence) Since the renowned British chemist Crook issued a warning in 1889 that the Chilean nitrate deposits were nearing depletion, farmers and industrialists have been greatly alarmed. The only natural source of nitrogen needed for the chemical industry was potassium nitrate. If the source were cut off and artificial manufacturing were used instead, the cost would be too high, which would cause the economic situation of the industry to be difficult to salvage. Fortunately, the brilliant Ignacmojciki (the current President of Poland), while serving as an assistant in the Physics Department of Fuforog University, invented the use of high-voltage electricity to directly synthesize oxygen and nitrogen. At the same time, he modified the original condenser to be made of glass, so that the voltage could be increased from 10,000 volts to 50,000 volts to complete the high-voltage synthesis of nitrogen (the glass condenser was also used by the Eiffel Tower radio station). In 1903, a nitric acid company was established in Fuforog, and Mościcki's invention was the extraction of anhydrous nitric acid from the air. From experimentation, it entered the industrialization period for the first time. In 1904, the Cracovie Academy of Sciences published Mościcki's paper on electrical insulation, and his reputation as a scientist began to flourish. In 1912, he quickly returned to Poland to take over the position of professor of physics and electrochemistry at the Swow Institute of Technology. Subsequently, when the European War broke out, he had to work hard to improve the Polish petroleum industry. The Motiau Academy was also established at this time. He made many improvements to the methods of petroleum extraction and refining and obtained patents for the production of gasoline and gaseous carbohydrates, etc. This is only a small part of his chemical inventions. In 1922, part of High Silesia and the Golian plant were returned to Poland. Mościcki uniquely dispatched new methods to increase the annual production of the plant from 70,000 tons of diluted compounds to 170,000 tons. This progress in the chemical industry must be regarded as one of Mościcki's greatest successes. After being elected president in 1926, his heavy duties were enough to hinder the progress of his scientific work, but he was still able to take time to build a large-scale chemical factory, namely a diluted compound factory, in the city of Mościce. Poland relied on Mościcki's greatest efforts to complete the above two factories, so that the country was not only not excluded in the international diluted compound market, but instead jumped to become one of the countries with the most surplus. Furthermore, he built a device that, under physical and chemical conditions, regardless of cities and villages, allowed people in cities to breathe fresh air. With Mościcki's thirty years of continuous efforts and struggles, the results obtained are not only beneficial to Poland, but also to the whole world. Moreover, as the head of state who holds the highest position and the most burdensome duties in a country, he can still calmly devote himself to science, which is rare and valuable. This is a brief overview of Mościcki's contributions to science.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Central Inspection Group Arrives in Beijing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 11th (Telegraph) More than 30 members of the Guangdong Central Industrial Inspection Group, led by Professor Qiu Bingmin of the school, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the 8th. They will visit various central government agencies on the 11th, and will inspect various construction projects in the capital from the 12th to the 15th. After the inspection is completed, they will go to Ping to inspect.</p>
<p>Casting of Phonetic Chinese Character Copper Molds Begins</p>
<h3>National Textbooks to be Changed</h3>
<p>Li Tan Investigates the Situation of Copper Mold Casting in Shanghai</p>
<p>Simplified Characters Drafted by Qian Xuantong to be Published</p>
<p>Mandarin in Beijing and Shanghai Spreads Naturally without Promotion</p>
<p>(Beijing Express News) Li Jinxi and Wang Yi, members of the National Language Unification Committee of the Ministry of Education, went to Beijing from Ping on the 22nd of last month at the invitation of Minister Wang Shijie. On the 26th, a meeting was held in the ministry to discuss the copper molds for phonetic Chinese characters and the issue of simplified characters. It was decided that Li and Wang would go to Shanghai to investigate the casting of copper molds, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday (the 8th), Li and Wang returned to Ping from Beijing. The reporter specially interviewed Mr. Li, and the conversation is as follows:</p>
<h3>National Textbooks and Newspapers to be Changed</h3>
<p>The motive for the Ministry of Education to carry out these two matters this time is actually because the country is in danger, and the majority of the people lack national consciousness, national concepts, and common sense of citizenship. If something happens one day, it will be difficult to resist materially, and it is feared that they will eventually fall into ruin spiritually. The central government has decided to allocate funds to quickly implement short-term compulsory education, shortened to about two years, and force people to attend school. Adult education will be carried out as usual by local mass education institutions. However, short-term teaching must remove the obstacles of difficult-to-recognize and difficult-to-write characters, otherwise there will be no practical effect. Therefore, the textbooks and general readings for compulsory education and mass education in the future will uniformly annotate the Chinese characters with phonetic symbols, that is, use the lead</p>
<p>characters cast by this copper mold for typesetting. If the phonetic symbols are fixedly linked to the Chinese characters, the labor of annotating each character will be saved during drafting, and the typesetter will also get two benefits in one fell swoop. It saves money and is also beautiful. If bookstores do not use this lead character for typesetting, they will not be approved and will be prohibited from selling. Newspapers across the country will also be required by the government to implement the ministry order of the Republic of China's 19th year, and must at least open a special column to print mass readings with this lead character.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Copper Mold Casting Investigation in Shanghai</h3>
<p>If this copper mold is finely made, the latest [mother mold machine] must be purchased and the copper plate engraved. Within three years, the number 3, 4, and 5 lead characters can be made for application, but the cost will be more than 100,000 yuan. Because the Chinese characters must be changed to rectangular, occupying one-third of the lead character, and phonetic symbols are added next to it to form a square, so that the typesetting does not take up too much space between the lines, the length will not increase, and the book price will be commensurate with the purchasing power of the public. Therefore, it must be written and engraved as a whole, and the project is relatively large. If old methods such as wood lead engraving or photographic copper plate are used, the cost can be saved more, but it is not as fine and deep as the mother mold copper plate and is not durable. As for rough manufacturing, the better ones among the imitation Song long-body characters of various families are taken, and phonetic symbols are arranged next to them for combined casting. Then the copper mold lead characters can be completed in half a year, and the cost is the most economical. Now, because of the urgent need for printing and engraving, this method will probably be adopted. Because this copper mold lead character is to be promoted to the publishing and printing industries across the country, it is based on the principle of not allowing patents. Therefore, Shanghai merchants cannot undertake it unconditionally, and the government must raise considerable funds.</p>
<h3>Simplified Characters to be Announced in Two Batches during Spring and Summer Vacations</h3>
<p>If simplified characters also need to be cast into lead character copper molds, Shanghai merchants are willing to undertake them. Magazine circles, such as The Analects and Taibai, are also automatically casting them. Mr. Lin Yutang and I talked about the Hanwen Regular Script lead characters used in The World. The Shanliangyou Company is also selecting and casting simplified characters, but on the one hand, they all hope that the Ministry of Education will officially recognize them so that the application can be popularized without obstruction. Before returning to Ping, it was agreed with the ministry that the National Language Committee would compile a [Practical Simplified Character List] and publish the first batch during the spring vacation, which are commonly used characters for children and the public. The second batch of simplified characters that have been circulating will be published during the summer vacation, all drafted by Mr. Qian Xuantong, and the style will be determined. In the future, they can also be used as simplified character practice templates and lead character copper mold templates. After the simplified character list is published, the textbook textbooks can be directly used as the main text. If the traditional characters need to be recognized, they will be annotated next to the new word column. Students who use simplified characters in the student association examination and school entrance examination papers will not be crossed out. As for the use of official documents, it still needs to be passed by the Central Executive Council. After this table is completed, it will still be made into a [Simplified Character Spectrum] within a year and a half according to the resolution of the National Language Committee's standing meeting. In the future, a special committee may be formed by the Ministry of Education to make final supplementary decisions. Also, the name of simplified characters cannot be called [Simplified Characters]. Simplified Characters are a kind of character invented by Lao Naixuan at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Simplified characters are still Chinese characters, but only the strokes are reduced. The Shanghai publishing industry may call them [Handwritten Characters], which is also an example of the same reality with a different name.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Education in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuxi</h3>
<p>Mr. Li also talked about his impressions of this trip to the south. He said that Mr. Wang and I visited the experimental area of the Wuxi Provincial Education Institute. Laborers' huts (rickshaw drivers, female workers, and poor families) are all equipped with educational facilities, and they are working very hard. However, everywhere I feel that the writing tools are not good, and it is very difficult for them to read books and newspapers. There are many fishing families in Taihu Lake. Because they live in boats and have no fixed mooring, education has not yet been possible. Standard Mandarin is no longer a problem. Because of the natural trend of transportation, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou radio broadcasts, and sound machines are everywhere, what you hear is Mandarin. I have not traveled south for twelve years, and I only learned that Mandarin has been spreading naturally without promotion. However, the use of phonetic symbols is not very strong in various schools, because the teachers are not familiar with it. In short, to revitalize the nation, we must rationalize the writing tools. This is a major issue in education.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Education Stipulates Agricultural Busy Season Holidays to Facilitate Elementary School Students in Rural Areas</h3>
<p>From the Beginning of Summer to the Grain in Ear, and from the Autumn Equinox to the Frost's Descent</p>
<p>Schools May Grant Holidays Based on Circumstances</p>
<p>The municipal elementary schools in the rural areas of this city have submitted a request to the Bureau of Education to urgently respond to the agricultural busy season and change the holidays. The bureau believes that the crops in the rural areas of this city are mostly vegetables, cotton, and wheat, which are slightly different from those in general rural areas. Granting holidays during the agricultural busy season is not a universal need for all schools. Therefore, it was decided to convene a meeting of more than ten principals of elementary schools in the rural areas to discuss and decide that June in the first half of the year, that is, from the Beginning of Summer to the Grain in Ear, and October in the second half of the year, that is, from the Autumn Equinox to the Frost's Descent, are the agricultural busy season. Whether each school needs an agricultural busy season holiday is determined by each school based on its own circumstances. If a holiday is required, it should be submitted to the bureau for approval ten days in advance. The holiday should not exceed two weeks, and a make-up class plan must be submitted. It is said that all elementary schools in the rural areas will be notified to comply.</p>
<h3>This City Organizes the Preparatory Committee for This Year's Centralized Military Training</h3>
<p>First Preparatory Meeting Convened</p>
<p>Organizational Rules for the Preparatory Committee Passed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education stipulates that from this year onwards, military training students in the first year of senior high school in each province and city must receive three months of centralized training. This city has now organized a preparatory committee, which is jointly organized by representatives from the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Education, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Public Safety, the Bureau of Finance, the Bureau of Public Works, the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Security Office, the Security Committee, and the National Military Training Committee. The first preparatory committee was convened a few days ago and passed the organizational rules for the preparatory committee. Preparations are now actively underway. It is said that the centralized military training will begin on April 11th.</p>
<h3>The Full-Time Member of the National Military Training Association of This City is Replaced</h3>
<p>Li Yaxiong Assigned by the Training Supervision Department</p>
<p>Since the former full-time member of the National Military Training Committee of this city resigned, Ouyang Dingming, a Jiaotong University instructor, has been acting as the full-time member. Now, the Training Supervision Department has officially appointed Li Yaxiong to take over. It is said that Mr. Li has already come to Shanghai to take over the matter.</p>
<h3>Mr. Xue Guangqian Sets Sail Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Various Groups Held Enthusiastic Farewell Party Last Night</p>
<p>Before Departing, Encouraging Young People to Save the Country Through Self-Reliance</p>
<p>Since the news of Mr. Xue Guangqian's study in Italy spread, various groups in this city believed that Mr. Xue had been serving the community for many years with outstanding achievements. This time, he is going abroad for further studies, and everyone should congratulate him. Therefore, a group farewell party was held at Xinghualou last night to bid him farewell. Those who attended the meeting included Bureau Chief of the Municipal Bureau of Education Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yu Ming, Municipal Party Committee Member Tao Baichuan, Chen Kecheng of the Municipal Government, Zhu Xuefan of the General Labor Union, Huang Zhaoxiong of the Municipal Education Association, Kang Xuanyi of the University Education Association, Ren Xianqun of the University League, Chen Jicheng of the Secondary Education Association, Xu Zexiang, Sun Xiaolou of Soochow University, Du Gang of the Municipal Education Bureau, Wang Longzhang of the Modern Thought Society, and representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Federation, the Chinese General Assembly of Nari, the China Cultural Construction Association, the Chinese Stenography Association, the Private School Advancement Association, the Chongming Shanghai Students Association, and various schools and newspaper agencies, totaling more than 300 people. Director Pan was elected to give the farewell speech, with many words of encouragement. Subsequently, Tao Baichuan, Sun Xiaolou, Zhu Xuefan, Huang Zhaoxiong, Chen Jicheng, Du Gang, and others successively gave speeches. Finally, Mr. Xue gave a reply, stating that the problem of China lies in the lack of organization of the people and the inefficiency of politics, so that even if there are perfect doctrines and policies, they cannot achieve practical results through the function of organization. This time he went to Italy, he planned to investigate the spirit of nation-building in that country, as a reference for the revival of China. Mr. Xue also elaborated on the way to save the country, stating that young people are the lifeblood of the nation, holding the future of the country's destiny. If the nation and clan want to continue and prosper, it is not enough for the youth of the country to break through obstacles and strive for self-reliance to achieve this goal. It is said that Mr. Xue will set sail on the Contifudi ship and will board the ship at the New Customs Pier at 8:00 tonight and leave the port tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Lixin Accounting Evening School Opens</h3>
<p>Lixin Accounting School, located at 190 Ningbo Road, this city, was founded by accountant Dr. Pan Xulun. Since its establishment, it has been seven and a half years. It is divided into two departments: correspondence and evening school. The correspondence department enrolls students all year round and can enroll at any time. The evening school department is one session every six months. The fourteenth session has ended, and the fifteenth session will open on February 11th. The classes offered by the evening school include: 1. Introductory and elementary accounting courses, 2. Advanced accounting courses (the above two courses are taught in both Chinese and English groups), 3. Bank accounting course, 4. Cost accounting course, 5. Auditing course, 6. Company accounting course, 7. Government accounting course, etc. It is said that the school, in view of the large number of applicants for admission in previous sessions and the limited school site and narrow classrooms, although it has tried its best to accommodate nearly 400 people, there are still dozens of applicants who are not admitted. Therefore, in order to remedy this regret, several large classrooms have been newly opened on the New China Bank building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Ningbo Road, and more classes have been opened to accommodate them. In addition, the class time of the evening school was originally from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day. This time is quite inconvenient for students who have no duties after 5:00 pm. It is now heard that from this session onwards, an early class has been added, which starts at 5:30 pm and ends at 7:15 pm, so that students who have finished their duties in various agencies early can go to school first and then return home to rest. It is now heard that because the opening date of the school is approaching, the number of people who go to register for admission these days is very crowded, and the classes offered will soon be full.</p>

<h3>New Female Tennis Player</h3>
<p>Ms. Xia Lanzheng Passes Away</p>
<p>Ms. Xia Lanzheng, a new female tennis player, unfortunately passed away on the day of Lichun. There has often been a sigh of talent shortage in tennis in China, and there are even fewer women who engage in tennis and can achieve good results. With Ms. Xia's qualifications and efforts, if she had been given time, she would have been able to achieve great things. It is a pity that God did not grant her a long life, and she passed away. This is not only a major loss for the tennis world, but also a tragedy for the Chinese people. Ms. Xia was 19 years old and belonged to Siming. She lost her father early and had only her mother and two younger siblings. She was kind and approachable, extremely intelligent, excellent in character and learning, and always had a childish air about her. Because she had two small braids behind her, her friend Dong often jokingly called her the "Double-Braid Girl," which she never took offense to. While studying at the Chinese and Western Girls' School, she became very interested in tennis. At that time, she was invincible in the school, and teachers and friends all praised her as not being an ordinary person. Sure enough, she showed her strength as soon as she started, and served as the city's representative to participate in the National Games. Last year, she won the open singles championship. Ms. Xia was not satisfied with this and still practiced hard every day. For the convenience of practice, she transferred to the Public Concession Girls' School last autumn, and her practice became even more diligent.</p>
<p>Ms. Xia was a member of the Chinese Sports Association. She usually liked to play against men during practice, very much in the style of Helen Wills of the United States. In addition to hard practice, she often sought advice from Sun Linfang and Zhou Guanjun. Seeing her talent, Sun and others had high expectations for her, and guided her wholeheartedly, sparing no effort. Ms. Xia was extremely intelligent, and after basic training, she progressed very quickly. Her forehand and backhand strokes were fast and accurate, her posture was graceful, and she had a good foundation, which was beyond the reach of other female tennis players.</p>
<p>Dr. Tu Kaiyuan admired her character very much, and Ms. Xia often asked him for advice. When the open singles was held last year, Dr. Tu put in a lot of effort and insisted on her practicing every morning, and personally supervised and instructed her in every battle. As a result, she won the championship. Since then, the two have become more and more intimate. Last winter, Dr. Tu went to further his studies again. Before leaving, he was reluctant to leave, but in the end he thought it was just a short separation. How could he have expected that one separation would become eternal? The ocean is vast and the paths of life and death are different. When Dr. Tu heard the news, he must have regretted having made this trip. Fate is so tricky.</p>
<p>Ms. Xia's illness was not fatal, but she had a small boil on the back of her neck, which was accidentally infected by dirt during a haircut, causing blood poisoning and making it impossible to recover. She passed away on the day of the Spring Festival, when the earth was reviving, and in the sound of firecrackers, this promising young woman fell asleep forever. Alas!</p>
<h3>French Indoor Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Paris, 10th) The French Indoor Tennis Championship, including men's singles, women's singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles, was held today. Therefore, many people came to watch. French player Ms. Adamov and Swiss player Ms. Bayo first took the court for the women's singles final. The French player took the lead at the beginning and used forehand strokes to attack the opponent fiercely, winning the first set. However, in the middle of the second set, the Swiss player gradually gained the upper hand and eventually won the last two sets in a row, winning the championship. The score was 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. Then French veteran Borotra and German player Poland 出场比人 came out to compete. Poland committed repeated mistakes, causing Borotra to easily take two sets. The third set was very competitive. Although Poland's球渐人佳境 got better, it was not enough to save the situation. As a result, Borotra won the French Indoor Tennis Championship with a straight set score of 6-2, 6-4.</p>
<h3>Youth Football Team Leaves Hangzhou, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Provincial Public Sports Field Presents Shield, Date Set for Return Match in Hangzhou on the 16th and 17th</p>
<p>After the youth football team arrived in Hangzhou, the heavens were unkind. From morning till night, it rained and snowed. Although they managed a small match with the Communications team, it was only a performance in the muddy field. The match against the Aviation United Preparatory Team had to be postponed. Unexpectedly, the continuous rain and snow dampened the spirits of the team members. With no desire to linger, Mr. Wu Jincheng, the head of the Shanghai Association, and Mr. Yang Sen led the team back to Shanghai yesterday at 1:00 PM. The Hangzhou Provincial Public Sports Field presented them with a silver shield inscribed with "Superior Beyond Compare," and a rematch was scheduled for the 16th of this month against the Hangzhou Football League champion United team, and on the 17th against the Aviation School Aviation Team.</p>

<h3>Financial Swap Approaching a Massive Short Squeeze</h3>
<p>Gold Market's Floating Long Positions Collapse</p>
<p>丨Continuing Downward Slide of Eleven Yuan丨</p>
<p>The gold market is under the massive threat of a short squeeze. Buyers find it extremely difficult to rally. The swap is on the verge of expiring, and the long positions are even more fearful, causing floating long positions to collapse. The foreign exchange market fuels the selling pressure, and the downward trend is quite severe, gradually weakening. The large long positions are also shaken, and the price has fallen to a low of 41.7 yuan before slightly stabilizing. In the morning, the London and New York silver markets were flat, and the forward silver price remained almost unchanged. London spot gold rose by one penny. Reports indicate that the Silver Price Research Committee, jointly formed by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and Jinling University, announced that to save the declining industry and commerce, it is necessary to reform the currency system and devalue silver to the level of 1931 (note that the foreign exchange rate in that year was close to one shilling and one penny, and the US dollar was around 20 yuan). This news boosted confidence, and off-exchange trading opened higher, rising to around 55 yuan. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with the British pound flat and the US dollar rising. The customs gold unit also rose by one li, and the standard price for the gold standard was 965.1 yuan. The morning opened high, but the foreign exchange market remained strong, and large short sellers exerted pressure, causing the price to fall immediately. Upon learning that the HSBC's official exchange rate showed the British pound rising by 1.25 and the US dollar rising by 3.125, selling pressure surged, pushing the price to around 50 yuan. Bargain hunting activities eased the decline. However, the foreign exchange market became overly relaxed, and although the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, the short sellers continued to exert pressure, causing the long positions to collapse. Despite some struggles, the selling pressure intensified, and the 50 yuan mark could not be maintained. The trend was extremely weak, and the market slightly stabilized at noon. In the afternoon session, the price fell due to the liquidation of long positions by the large firm Fuchang, but the initial report of a decrease in Indian silver by four annas led to a rebound. Banks continued to offer positions, but the market remained loose and lacked support. Floating long positions took the opportunity to close out their positions and pushed the price down to 41.3 yuan. The domestic market of banks stabilized, and there was some support after the low, gradually rebounding. However, the second report of an increase in Indian silver by one anna caused the market to turn sideways. The trend is still difficult to revive, and with the swap approaching, the situation is extremely unfavorable for the long positions. Large firms continue to arbitrage, and the future is not optimistic. The daily market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 954.3 yuan, slightly higher than the previous close by 0.9 yuan. It then went to 954.7 yuan. Yuan Heng, Yu Li, Yong Li, Yu Qing, Yong Da, Da Heng, Yu Zhaofeng, Chang Qian, Chang Xiang, Da De Cheng, and Chang Da were all sellers, retreating to around 41 yuan. Tian Cheng Xiang, Yong Li, Fu Sheng, Yong Yuan, Mao Yong, and Lai Jin rose to 42.3 yuan. The foreign exchange market strengthened, with February U.S. dollars at 36.1875 and April at 34.625 being difficult to sell. February shillings were trading at 1s. 5 6875d. Upon hearing HSBC's quote of the British pound rising 1.25 and the U.S. dollar rising 3.125, the market weakened. Chang Da, Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Da Chang Xiang, Wan Chang, and Yong Fu Yu, Yi Yu, Zhen Tai, and Da Cheng all sold, falling to 50.01 yuan. Heng Yu, Da Fa, Yong Fu Yu, Da Yuan, Yi Min, and Yi Feng Yong took advantage of the low to buy bars, rising to 50.24 yuan. HSBC offered April shillings at 1s. 5 0625d, and Citibank offered March U.S. dollars at 36.3125. Da Fa, Yong Yuan Yi, Qian Chang Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, and Yi Feng Yong successively sold bars, gradually retreating to 48.5 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, Yu Qing, Yong Chun Yuan, Yong Yuan Tai Han, and Heng, etc. took advantage of the low to replenish positions, rising back to 50.03 yuan. However, Xin Feng offered March U.S. dollars at 36.3125, and April shillings at 1s. 5 0625d were difficult to sell. Zhao Chang, Yu Li, Fu Yu, Yuan Yi Tong, Yu Run, Fu Xing, and Yong Yuan Mao Yong sold to 47 yuan. Yi Feng Yong Sheng, Da Chang Da, and Heng Yu advanced to 48 yuan. Macgregor offered April U.S. dollars at 34.75. Yu Qing, Yong, Yong Li, and Da Fa Yong unwound positions, retreating again to 46.5 yuan. Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong Heng, Chang Yong Yuan Yi accepted bars, rising to 47.8 yuan. Floating long positions continued to sell, and Fu Xing Yong also sold. The noon closing was 946.9 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 945.9 yuan, then went to 946.1 yuan. Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, Tian Feng, Heng Yu, Heng Chang, Yong Zheng, Chang Qian, and Chang Xiang were all sellers. Banque Belge offered February U.S. dollars at 36.1875, retreating to 44.2 yuan. Retail investors tried to support the market. Da Fa Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Yu, and Da De Cheng Lai Jin. Mitsui bought March U.S. dollars at 35.4375, gradually rebounding. Although Yi Yu and Yuan Mao Yong sold, the price rose to 46.5 yuan due to a decrease of four annas in Indian silver. Heng Yu, Chang Da, Fu Xing Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Feng Ding Kang all advanced, and Zheng Jin bought March U.S. dollars at 35.375. Retail investors closed out their profits, and the market lacked support. Banque Belge offered March U.S. dollars at 35.375 and February at 36.1875. Fu Xing Yong Heng Chang, Yong Zhao Feng, Chang Yu Li, Qian Chang Xiang, and Tong Yu Run all sold, gradually falling to 41.3 yuan. Fu Yu and Heng Yu took advantage of the low to accept bars, rebounding to 42.7 yuan. Yuan Chang Yong, Fu Xing Yong, and Heng Chang Yong sold, retreating to 41.7 yuan. Fu Yu Yuan Mao Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Fu Xing Yong, and Heng Chang Yong still advanced at the low, and the foreign exchange market was also flat, rising to 43.4 yuan. Indian silver rose by one anna, and the market became stable. Fu Yu, etc. unwound positions, and the closing price retreated to 942.4 yuan. After the closing, although Heng Chang Yong advanced, the market remained weak due to the unwinding of floating long positions. The highest price for the day was 954.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 942.3 yuan, a fluctuation of 13.4 yuan. As a result, the price fell another 11 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard price for the gold standard, was 965.1 yuan. The closing price was suppressed by approximately 22 yuan, 11 yuan more than last Saturday. The March registration was 947 yuan, the morning water replenishment was 935 yuan, and the afternoon water replenishment was 930 yuan. The red gold price was estimated at 954.3 yuan. The spot market remained quiet. Tianjin goods were offered at a premium of 3.5 yuan over the term standard, but no transactions were made. The spot-term swap was generally offered by the long positions at around 7 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. Large short sellers continued to exert pressure, and the long positions collapsed. In summary, Fu Chang Heng Yu, Yuan Yi Yi Yu, Tong Yu Run Chang Da, Tong Tai Chang Yuan Heng Zhao Feng Chang Qian, and Chang Xiang were sellers. Yuan Mao Yong Fu Yu Yong Li, Da Da Yi Feng Yong Da Fa Yong, Yong De Chun Hui Xiang, and Da De Cheng Yi Yi Cheng Heng Chang Yong were buyers. Heng Chang Yong Hui Xiang Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Yi Da De Cheng first sold and then bought. Shun Mao Qing Fa Yong Yi Feng Yong Han Heng advanced and then sold.

Heng Xing advanced slightly. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,171 bars in the morning and 17,997 bars in the afternoon. The number of March futures contracts increased to 23,646. There were a total of 65 long firms and 42 short firms.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Continues to Loosen</h3>
<p>Situation More Peaceful Than Gold Market</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Sell U.S. Dollars and Buy British Pounds</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, London big bars were flat for both near and far terms. New York silver prices were unchanged. Monte Rio forward silver prices rose and fell slightly. London spot gold rose one penny. The British pound rose 1.25 against the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. dollar rose 6.25 against the British pound. The British pound fell 7 pounds against the French franc, and the U.S. dollar rose 1.625 against the French franc. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices, the British exchange rate at one shilling and five pence and seventy-five hundredths, and the U.S. exchange rate at 36 yuan and six hundred and twenty-five ten-thousandths, compared to last Saturday's noon closing, the British pound was flat and the U.S. dollar was tighter by six hundred and twenty-five ten-thousandths. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, the British pound was flat and the U.S. dollar rose by six hundred and twenty-five ten-thousandths, and the customs gold unit rose by one li, with no significant impact. The banks' appetite was not strong, and the Chinese merchants' intake was still weak, and the market loosened as soon as it opened. Upon learning of HSBC's official exchange rate announcement, the British pound rose by 1.25 and the U.S. dollar rose by 1.325. Although the banks did some hedging, the process was already tight. After entering the market, Sassoon and the banks mutually offered positions. The silver equalization tax was announced, and although it was not changed, due to a lack of support, the situation continued to loosen. Although the banks did some hedging, they were unable to sustain the market due to oversupply. In the afternoon session, banks offered near-term positions and bought far-term positions, and the initial report of a decrease in Indian silver by four annas made the situation more peaceful. Although the banks continued to supply, the Chinese merchants' psychology was extremely weak, and their intake was not strong, so the selling pressure was not intense, and the market was loose but not strong. The final situation was mediocre, and the recent selling price at the closing was 1s. 5 875d for the British exchange rate and 36.4375 yuan for the U.S. exchange rate. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound was firmer by 1.25 and the U.S. dollar was firmer by 3.125. Chinese merchants engaged in frequent buying and selling, and the market slightly bought U.S. dollars and sold gold standard, and slightly bought shillings. The daily transactions are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Financial Sector Remains Quiet After Reopening</h3>
<p>Reflecting This Year's Sluggish Market Sentiment</p>
<p>Yesterday was Monday. Normally, banks would be busy with opening and settling accounts. However, due to the Lunar New Year holiday, the financial sector only operated for half a day. In the afternoon, there was nothing to do as usual, so business was quite quiet. In addition, the money market was poor, and most firms adopted a contractionary policy and were unwilling to engage in extensive trade. Therefore, the market situation across various sectors remained largely unchanged. Although interbank lending rates were tight, they did not rise. The morning market rate was only 6%, similar to the previous day. The premium rate was added, and because there was no afternoon market, there was no market price. In terms of bill transactions, morning transfers amounted to over 1.7 million, with new transactions of over 400,000. The source of funds included 150,000 in silver from Ningbo and Tianjin, with no outflow. There was no lending activity against foreign goods, only 300,000 was repaid. In terms of bank settlements, foreign banks settled over 900,000 in bills, 2.8 to 2.9 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and miscellaneous loans, 1.4 million in rice loans, and over 400,000 in special remittances, with 100,000 going into warehouses. Chinese banks settled over 1 million in bills, 2.6 to 2.7 million in various goods, foreign exchange, taxes, and miscellaneous loans, over 1.2 million in rice loans, over 500,000 in special remittances, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, with inflows and outflows balanced. Japanese banks settled 500,000 to 600,000 in bills, 800,000 to 900,000 in various goods and miscellaneous loans, over 400,000 in special remittances, and 200,000 went out of warehouses. Money shops settled 5.5 to 5.6 million in foreign government bonds, over 1.2 million in premium loans, over 200,000 in inter-city remittances, and over 100,000 in cash. In addition, the total number of bills exchanged at the local clearing house on the 11th was 5,836,719.96 silver dollars, including 4,094,149.03 silver dollars and 1,742,570.93 silver dollars in remittances.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Coin Market Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market prices of various subsidiary coins generally declined. Jiangnan small silver coins were priced at 820 yuan in the morning, down 10 yuan from the previous day, with 3,000 units traded. Guangdong small silver coins were priced at 755 yuan, down 3.8 yuan from the previous day, with 45,000 units traded. Copper coins rose by 2,000 cash, to 319,000 cash, with 51,040 strings traded, equivalent to 16,000 silver dollars. All prices were suspended in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Securities and Bonds Fall Across the Board</p>
<h3>The 23rd Customs Bond Alone Rises by Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Abnormal State of the Government Bond Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was 6%, slightly higher by 4%. The environment was stable as before, but sentiment seemed softer. Most firms were selling, except for the 23rd Customs Bond, which was actively absorbed. At a time when various market prices were falling sharply, the 23rd Customs Bond soared according to its book value, rising by over four yuan in one session and then being suspended from trading. This extremely abnormal and distorted state was rare. There were various rumors in the market, but no confirmed information. Some said that the Ministry of Finance intended to completely redeem the 23rd Customs Bond and issue 20 million yuan of the 24th Customs Bond, with the principal repayment halved compared to the 23rd Customs Bond. This argument seemed unlikely, because the government would first need to raise several million yuan to redeem nearly 10 million yuan of the 23rd Customs Bond, which was already circulating in the market, before issuing the 24th Customs Bond. Moreover, there was no prior indication of this measure, so it was not credible. Others said that because the amount of the 23rd Customs Bond circulating in the market was very small, it was easy for capitalists to monopolize it. This measure has many precedents, but at the same time, other bonds should also rise, not diverge so greatly. Still others said that in view of the favorable terms of the 23rd Customs Bond, financial firms sold other bonds and bought the 23rd Customs Bond, thus causing a squeeze. This reasoning seemed more plausible. Currently, the 23rd Customs Bond is at 90%, and the March futures market price is only 9 yuan different from the par value. What is the underlying reason? It will be clear within a day or two. The trend and future direction may be upward due to the surge in the 23rd Customs Bond. Yesterday's market was extremely chaotic. When the market opened, numbers 4, 5, and 11, etc. were selling, and various bonds were falling sharply. When the 23rd Customs Bond was auctioned, the atmosphere in the market suddenly tightened. The opening price rose by 2 yuan. At that time, numbers 11, 23, 47, and 48 were the most active buyers. The market price jumped and rose sharply, and in an instant, it rose by more than 4 yuan and was suspended from trading. In the next session, sellers were still very active, and the market price fell slightly by 2 to 3, 6 to 7 corners. The 23rd Customs Bond was temporarily suspended due to tracking. As a result, except for the 23rd Customs Bond, which rose to the limit, the rest fell. The total transaction volume was 16,401,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: face value yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Subject to Environmental Constraints</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned weak again. The environment is poor, and the financial situation in Shanghai is uneasy. People's confidence remains low. However, some still spread rumors that once a certain issue is implemented, it will greatly benefit the buyers. Therefore, the tight positions are firmly held. However, the price of 20-count Japanese yarn is 10 yuan cheaper than Chinese yarn, which puts pressure on the market.</p>
<h3>Golden Chicken Quiet and Weak</h3>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard yarn showed flat and weak prices across all months. Overseas cotton prices fell slightly, and rumors about a certain issue the previous day remained unconfirmed. In addition, the transaction volume for spot yarn was less than the previous day, and the market became even more depressed. The results were mostly flat, with distant months falling by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan. The afternoon opening remained quiet. According to investigations, Tongcheng Company still intends to deliver February contracts due to the tight economic situation. The transaction volume in the market was extremely low, and there were many defaulted transactions, indicating the decline of commerce.

The current consumption of cotton is very limited.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Cotton Scattered</h3>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard cotton showed softening prices across all months. Indian and American cotton markets declined across the board, and exchange rates rose. There were few buyers in the market, and the market felt scattered and lacked momentum. Each month fell slightly by 0.05 yuan. The afternoon opening remained volatile, but gold prices rebounded by 7 to 8 yuan, and market sentiment was not affected. Bullish traders were holding tight to their positions.

<h3>Indian Cotton Alone Seen Firm This Past Week</h3>
<p>丨British Cotton Market Concludes Few丨</p>
<p>Bombay: At the beginning of the week, the market price fell slightly due to profit-taking by long positions, farmers selling short, and weak demand. Later, due to rumors that a major European company was buying large quantities of Bai Luo Creek cotton, the price rose rapidly. In addition to short covering and speculative buying in April and May, there were also buyers buying Bai Luo Creek and selling in Liverpool, with some rolling over to July and August. At the same time, speculators in the market resumed buying, so the market situation was extremely firm. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>
<p>1934 1935</p>
<p>Cumulative from September 1 921 933</p>

<p>Spot trading in Liverpool was very good last week. Futures prices were on hold, awaiting a resolution to the gold bullion loan case. Towards the end of the week, long positions took profits, but these were absorbed by retail investors. Short covering occurred at the weekend, and the market situation became firm. Egyptian cotton prices were weak due to the unstable American cotton market, and long positions unwound their positions.</p>

<h3>Grains Tianjin Guild Extracting This Month's Flour</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the prices for each month were generally stable and rising. There were no official reports on foreign wheat, but according to private sources, prices rebounded by 3, 4, or 5 jiao. When the prices opened, the market sentiment for this month was initially stable. Soon after, due to the Tianjin guild extracting [flour], people’s confidence gradually improved. Distant months [prices] rose due to continuous spring snow. Based on past experience, [people] worried that it might affect the wheat harvest. Therefore, buying sentiment was strong, and out-of-town merchants also made some purchases, causing the market to gradually rise. Regarding the factories, it was heard that only Fufeng sold some futures, while the rest did not sell. Given the current situation, if sales to the north continue, there is still a possibility of a favorable trend for this month. As a result, this month rebounded by 3 fen, March rose by 2.5 fen, April and May rose by 3.5 fen, June rose by 2 fen, and July rose by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Improved by Spring Snow</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after opening in the morning, showed a favorable trend for all months. Due to the absence of reports on foreign wheat, people lacked a basis for their sentiment. However, the spring drought was relatively severe, and continuous spring snow, based on customary speculation, might have some slight impact on the future of the wheat market. Therefore, after the opening price, the market sentiment immediately turned positive, and trading in all months became active. Bids increased by 3 fen. Approaching the afternoon opening, the near-term market remained stable, continuing to rise by 1 fen. The distant months saw a slight weakness due to weaker buying sentiment and some sales of foreign wheat futures. As a result, this month rose by 4 fen, March rose by 3 fen, and April rose by 2 fen. Spot wheat [market was flat] because factories’ appetite was unchanged, and there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to Rise by a Few Jiao After Rain</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Due to the initial opening of the market after the Lunar New Year, the arrival of ships seemed to be less, with only two ships arriving. The sales market in this street started to move, and the scene continued to show an upward trend. The price of Jiangsu and Tongzhou glutinous rice increased by 1 jiao, and the price of Nanhang early rice increased by several fen, approaching 1 jiao. Although the demand for late rice from Qingjiao and other districts seemed to be less than before, with only 300 to 400 packages purchased by Qingdao merchants, the final result was that people were optimistic due to the limited arrivals, and the price rose by 1 jiao. Consequently, various types of rice such as Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan also followed suit.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, more than the remaining ships from various routes arrived at the river. Due to the rain on the first day of the New Year opening, there were few sales. Yesterday, the total sales of goods from river factories in the market were about 7,000 dan. The market's appetite for various goods was flat, and local merchants' sentiment looked weak. The price of Jiashan early rice was down a few fen. The price of medium and lower-grade northern glutinous rice and thin rice also lacked vitality. The price of customer-specified top-grade rice remained stable. Other varieties were not abundant in the market, and prices remained unchanged.</p>

Yesterday, only 2,500 bags of Saigon rice were opened, and the price was lowered by 5 fen. However, glutinous rice, with fewer arrivals, was able to hold steady. Only customer Xian rice, with fewer arrivals and high production prices, made transportation unprofitable. People were originally optimistic, and yesterday some Nanjing merchants tried to purchase, and local merchants also responded. Therefore, all Xian rice uniformly rose by 7-8 fen to over 1 jiao. A total of more than 3,000 bags were opened throughout the day, all purchased by local and Nanjing merchants.</p>
<h3>Yellow Beans Continue to Rise by More Than 1 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yellow bean market, compared to Saturday, except for Hankou beans due to small appetite, the market was stable. The rest all continued to rise by 1 jiao to 1.5 jiao, mainly because factory sales were vigorous, and people were quite optimistic. In the afternoon closing, the demand for bean cakes from out-of-town merchants slightly weakened, causing the market to show a more stable situation. Yesterday, the total market saw factories buying 18 carloads of Dayun Siping Street beans, priced at 4 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen; 8 carloads of Yingzhou beans, priced at 4 yuan; 2 carloads of Quanhe beans, priced at 4 yuan and 4 fen; 1 carload of Bengbu beans, priced at 3 yuan 9 jiao; and more than 1,000 packages of Guide beans, priced at 4 yuan and 2 fen.

<h3>Two Different Kinds of Romanticism</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>The importance of discussing the issue of romanticism, now that the slogan of realism is being given serious attention, need not be elaborated upon here. Some people may think that theoretical discussions alone are just empty talk and do not benefit reality. I do not want to completely deny this. Those articles that ignore specific realistic conditions, indiscriminately pile up the names of many foreign works, and use confused logic to parrot others, probably do more than just no good in practice. On the contrary, specific and practical introductions and studies are not only beneficial but also very necessary.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of what kind of romanticism we need now, there has already been a considerable amount of introduction in literary circles. Even in the November 17th issue of this journal last year, Mr. Qi's article "Realistic and Romantic" gave a brief overview. However, this issue is quite complex. Literary historians have always found it extremely difficult to review romanticism, or even displayed confusion as a result. Even today, as literary theory enters a new stage of development, there is still no correct and comprehensive understanding of this issue, although the main principles have been confirmed to some extent.</p>
<p>As an attempt, I am raising this issue again here. First, I want to use the results of reliable literary history to discern that there are clearly two essentially different tendencies in past romantic literature. Because in this way, when we talk about the question of "what is our romanticism," we may be able to obtain a more powerful basis.</p>
<p>The social cause of the rise of romanticism was the social change that occurred. In the process of social change, it mainly divided into two different tendencies: one social group walked on a dark path leading directly to the tomb of history, and the other social group marched on a "path of life" leading directly to the stage of history. In essence, these are two completely opposite tendencies; however, these two tendencies both go through the same phenomenon. To give an example, this "dark path" and "path of life," although their trends are opposite, they must both go through a dark tunnel during the period of social change. At this time, whether it is people walking on the "dark path" or people walking on the "path of life," they are surrounded by darkness; therefore, a kind of "fantasy" arises. Furthermore, because of the subjective differences in society, this "fantasy" is also divided into two opposing types: one type, although feeling the darkness around them, is because they themselves are part of this darkness, so although their "fantasy" takes on various forms, in essence, it is a eulogy to darkness; the other type also feels the darkness, but they pass through the reality of darkness, ardently yearning for the light, and fiercely hating and resisting the darkness. On these two different foundations, two different romanticisms are produced: degenerative and progressive.</p>
<p>Looking at the historical facts of the past makes the above words even more convincing. From the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century, the socio-economy of Western Europe underwent rapid changes. The establishment and development of the capitalist mode of production led to the gradual decline of the feudal system. At this time, classicism, as the artistic form of the feudal system, was negated and criticized by romanticism. For example, the general rational tendency of classicism, the unities, etc., were all abandoned by the emerging romanticism; but these are all the symbols of romanticism that are opposed to classicism, not the essential characteristics of romanticism. If we further seek the essential characteristics from the romanticism of various countries, then two different romanticisms will appear before us. In England, the romanticism of Scott, Byron, and Wordsworth is degenerative; the romanticism of Coleridge, Southey, Godwin, and Shelley is progressive. Similarly, in the romantic literature of France and Germany, we can also find the two types of degenerative and progressive. Those belonging to the former include Chateaubriand and Vigny in France, Fouque and Arnim in Germany, etc.; those belonging to the latter include Victor Hugo and Heinrich Heine in France, and A.H. Hoffmann and Heinrich Heine in Germany. Degenerative romanticism sympathizes with the decline of the aristocratic class, and their "fantasy" is nothing more than a funeral song for the aristocratic class; progressive romanticism, however, sings the birth song of capitalism with terrible heat. Some writers, such as Sant and Heine, are both possessors of these two romanticisms. I can only briefly summarize it here because I cannot conduct literary history research in this short article.</p>
<p>All new schools in history, because their subjective requirements are consistent with the development of the objective reality of history, their art is realistic. However, as described above, when a new school rises, it inevitably has the expression of "fantasy" romanticism. Does this seem like a very conflicting view on the surface? However, in fact, this view will not conflict. As mentioned earlier, progressive romanticism starts from reality. These romantic "fantasies" are just like the romantic will of a high-spirited young man who rebels against reality. Because he already has a rebellious heart towards reality, he is fundamentally different from those who dare not face reality and escape reality. At this point, we can draw a conclusion: All emerging literature in history is necessarily "realistic and romantic."</p>
<p>It is also for this reason that it is easy to cause misunderstandings if we traditionally say that romantic literature is "dealing with reality with a thoroughly subjective idealistic attitude" without adding considerable limits, i.e., that the romanticism referred to is a degenerative one. Because for progressive romanticism, such as Shelley, Heine, etc., in a philosophical sense, we might as well say that it is realistic.</p>
<h3>An Ant on a Hot Pot</h3>
<p>— Lin Qiu</p>
<p>In the sleepless night, in the deathly silence, I used the mirror of memory to reflect on myself over the past five or six years. What appeared in the mirror at this time was an ant on a hot pot.</p>
<p>Driven from the countryside to the city by an invisible and vicious whip, and then from the city back to the countryside: hitting walls, stumbling, pain, shouting, struggling; the body became thinner day by day, and the soul became thinner day by day, but still circling like this, endlessly, without exception, just like an ant on a hot pot.</p>
<p>Yes. The present society is a hot pot, and I am the ant on this hot pot.</p>
<p>One sultry summer night, I escaped from the firehouse-like attic room with a body full of sweat, lying on the cool cement floor of the balcony, silently exhaling under the double oppression of life and anger, looking at the brilliant stars. A thunderbolt-like fire alarm made me painfully sacrifice all my property within three minutes – two shelves of messy old books.</p>
<p>Carrying a tattered small suitcase, stepping on the cool road in the deep silence of the night, after a long period of consideration, I knocked on the door of a foreign companion's room. A small attic room with a monthly rent of five yuan, without electricity, without a washbasin, without a stove, and without a cool breeze, old newspapers were pasted on the torn walls, and three shirtless Korean youths were lying on the newspapers. After they asked a few indifferent questions, they fell asleep snoring again. I hummed a heavy sigh and found my sleeping spot at the base of the wall.</p>
<p>Then, as usual, I was driven from the city to the countryside by an invisible and vicious whip, to a rural elementary school. For half a year, in order to adapt to the harsh environment, I had to paint a hypocritical mask on my true face. Hypocritical to colleagues, hypocritical to students, and even more hypocritical to friends outside. Wearing a hypocritical mask, I lived a life as heavy as Mount Tai and as empty as a vacuum under the exploitative machine of extremely meaningless and extremely busy work.</p>
<p>I remember one Saturday night, the pain and boredom made me bravely drink more than four times my usual amount of yellow wine and fell dead drunk under the table. In the completely unconscious state of drunkenness, I vomited out the truth that had been accumulated in my chest for months like a volcanic eruption: I severely criticized the inferior behavior of each colleague. When I woke up the next day, I realized that I had caused a great disaster, but it was too late to remedy it. As a result, the cruel fate almost fell on me again.</p>
<p>With a trembling heart, I barely got through one semester. I could not and did not want to be here next semester. Like an ant on a hot pot, I was about to crawl from the countryside to the city again. The unbearable pain that the city had given me had been deeply buried in another kind of pain I had suffered in the past half year. At this moment, I vaguely felt that an unprecedented happy life was waiting for me in the hazy city, just like my feeling about the countryside when I left the city.</p>
<h3>A Poor Woman Spins Yarn by the River</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Sorrow Comes to Bother People</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>"A thousand homes with laughter, slow to cease, anxieties creep in, known beyond things.</p>
<p>Standing alone on the city bridge, no one knows, Watching the star for a morning seems like moon time."</p>
<p>After eating the New Year dumplings prepared by myself, the firecrackers everywhere had already sounded like fried beans. While listening to Shen Ding and a friend from afar were playing chess, under a lamp, I remembered these lines of Huang Zhongze's poem.</p>
<p>In the feudal era, encountering a peaceful and prosperous age with no surprises, spending New Year's Eve in the countryside, that feeling was extremely mysterious. And our contemporaries insisted on leaving their reunited families. At this moment, when laughter slowly ceased in every home, they ran alone to the desolate bridgehead to look at a star. This action seemed strange, but it was not strange at all. Most of the poets in China in the past were good at seeking sorrow and finding hatred. "For writing new words, forcing to say sorrow" was the reason for "loving to go upstairs," so what was so strange about standing alone on the city bridge watching the stars?</p>
<p>In this New Year's Eve at the end of the world, guarding a wall of light, even a heart as hard as iron cannot avoid "anxieties creeping in, known beyond things." This night is really a bit different. You don't want to think about anything, but demons insist on making you think about them.</p>
<p>In this China where it is difficult to live, the end of the year is really a gateway to hell. In the city, I only feel that my wallet is tight, and I see red notices sealing the doors of some shops, and there are also those who cannot report a business closure and commit suicide by self-immolation. The economic rope is tightly fastened around everyone's neck, and so many lives are strangled to death. The countryside is originally like a thin ghost. At the first mention of the "end of the year," it immediately withers and transforms into a skeleton. Everyone carries heavy debts on their backs, and cannot even afford a cotton-padded coat on their bodies. In front of every house, you will see people arguing and fighting for money. Vicious dogs hug the sticks of debt collectors. Good people will also turn into "thieves with ulterior motives," hiding a kitchen knife in the mountain gully waiting for the God of Wealth. A bolt of cloth or a string of wood can turn you into a "person falling on the road." As the end of the year approaches, people's courage seems to suddenly increase, and tragic news is discussed and replaced by everyone.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a student living in the countryside wrote the following letter: "Now my village is bankrupt beyond recognition. All day long, I can't hear anything else, only hearing this family selling the house and that family pawning the land. Because of years of drought and insect plagues, there is no harvest at all. People lack food and clothing. In our local area, the official and private taxes that should be levied on each acre of land every year are no less than one yuan or more. If you think that food and clothing are not sufficient, where can this money come from? No one wants to pawn land. Some sell their daughters, and some run away from debt and dare not go home. There is a term. I don't know if the teacher knows it, which is "reporting the drum." This means that they cannot afford to repay the debt, and they sell all their possessions completely. Finally, they invite the creditors to a table of guests, and it is considered cleared. This "reporting the drum" happens often in my village. It is even more severe in the few days leading up to the New Year. Furthermore, the poor hang themselves because they cannot get through the New Year, and some borrow money at an interest rate of five or six cents. My family's finances are bankrupt. My dad won't let me continue next semester. I cried for three days, but there was nothing I could do! Teacher, think about what kind of world this is!"</p>
<p>Tonight, I thought of this poor student, I thought of the bankrupt villages and cities, and I thought of all the heartbreaking things in the world. I didn't run to the city bridge to watch the stars. Sitting under this light, sorrow came to bother my heart in the sound of firecrackers!</p>
<p>Old New Year's Eve</p>
<h3>A Trip to Luokou (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>㈡ A Glimpse of Luokou</p>
<p>Turning over a snow-covered embankment, the slender black shadows of the iron bridge and the gray-yellow posture of the city walls appeared eye-catchingly in the snow. This was the town of Luokou we were heading for. Just now, we were still walking on a relatively smooth motor road. Now, the road leading to Luokou has become a bumpy, snow-covered, dilapidated road. After entering the city, the road became even worse. The car often got stuck in the snow and mud, making it difficult to move forward or backward. If we wanted to get out of the car, there was no place to stand. This place really felt like old China. Only the coachmen could get out of the car and help each other, slowly pushing and pulling the cars in front to overcome the difficult situation, and then move the cars behind. In this way, the car pullers were more hard-pressed, and the passengers also felt embarrassed. Originally, we wanted to go to a more lively place, but we completely gave up the idea and chose a quiet place, heading straight to the Yellow River.</p>
<p>The north city wall of Luokou Town is the embankment of the Yellow River. Walking on the street, we saw the upper ends of many sails exposed above the embankment. The river water was as yellow as its name suggests. It has not yet frozen. Countless ice floes, as big as houses, floated on the water, slowly flowing downstream, which was very beautiful. It was as if the thawing Volga River in the spring, which I had seen in movies before, actually appeared before my eyes. It is said that at this time last year, the river had already been frozen with very thick ice, and donkey carts and horse carts could freely pass over it.</p>
<p>If there were not two or three wooden cargo ships slowly sailing between the ice floes, and small boats full of passengers slowly crossing to the other side, the river would be very desolate. Because the river water was not clean, the ice floes appeared dirty, and when the sunlight shone on them, they did not reflect any brilliant light. Perhaps it was because we were standing on the south bank, facing the sun in the north.</p>
<p>There is a Luokou Railway Station on the river embankment. The rails are divided into two tracks, both lying in the snow. One track curves to join the Jinpu Railway, and the other stretches straight, passing under the Yellow River Iron Bridge, forming a cross shape with the Jinpu Railway. Next to the station, there were many rural teenagers, dressed up in various male and female roles, with wooden feet more than a foot high tied to their feet, performing the walking postures of old operas. Beside them, there were musical instruments such as gongs and drums playing along, just like performing a play. However, there were fewer people watching than performing, probably because they were taking advantage of this lonely snowy day to perform plays to entertain themselves.</p>
<p>㈢ The Yellow River Iron Bridge</p>
<p>Seeing the iron bridge with its steel figure lying powerfully on the Yellow River, I felt that the dirty Yellow River became even more weak and pitiful, as if it was chained with thick chains. At the same time, I vaguely felt that the fate of old China was somewhat similar to this.</p>
<p>The Yellow River Iron Bridge was built by German engineers. The head of the bridge is covered with German words. It is 1,250 meters long.</p>
<p>On the bridge, the middle is the Jinpu Railway track, and the sides are sidewalks. Just as we were about to go up and take a walk, two soldiers guarding in front of the stone house, basking in the sun and reading books, said:</p>
<p>"Sir, don't walk on it. You can only look at the bridgehead."</p>
<p>It is said that pedestrians were allowed to walk on it before, but now even tourists are forbidden to stand on it. I don't know for what reason, but the attitude and tone of the guards were very kind, unlike the soldiers of the past who, when they had guns, showed a very arrogant and disrespectful attitude towards the common people. While we were looking at the bridgehead, the soldiers who were reading were still immersed in their books. At the same time, several bald-headed guards emerged from the stone wall house and concentrated on practicing gymnastics on the scaffolding built by the roadside. Their sincere appearance was really admirable. I don't know why, but at this time I felt a great interest in these bridge-guarding soldiers, and I constantly shifted my gaze from watching the river view to them. When we were about to leave, as we walked past the two guards who were focused on reading, I took a closer look and found that they were reading "The Story of Yue Fei."</p>
<h3>High Altitude (1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Henri Barbusse, Translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>At the fifth hour, we replenished our supplies in the interior of North Africa. We landed in the chaotic civilization of Europe, adorned with trams, streets, and cities. We walked on the road, and above, the sound of the waves of stench emitted from the nose of the plane could be heard.</p>
<p>··· One morning, we flew behind a large white chessboard embedded in the green coast of Africa. Our plane flew diagonally past the Strait of Gibraltar. It drew a tangent line in Spain and flew away. Our flight in the European sky was a period of testing speed in the uppermost layer of the atmosphere. Europe was under us, engulfed in a whirlwind. A slow flight at a speed of 300 kilometers per hour. The continent, the objects appearing on the island factory site, and the field of vision from 50 kilometers above. (One hour, 2,000 francs of volatile oil and kerosene).</p>
<p>Nights of distress and nightmares, erected between things on the ground.</p>
<p>Occasionally, in that infinitely long lament, came an unexpected wireless phone call. I went to visit Uncle Louis, who lived in Kyoto and had a pleasant face. Surrounded by relatives and friends, Uncle, sitting in an armchair, was still so solemn. A face full of gentle love, wearing a beautiful linen robe and velvet in the clothing court, like a romantic poet, was covered in the pale color of death.</p>

<p>Conversations</p>
<h3>On Group Weddings and Others</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>I remember that last December, the Japan Family Science Research Society published a comparison table of marriage expenses in various countries around the world. It said that for a family with an annual income of 2,000 yuan, the proportion of marriage expenses to annual income was: England 1, France 1, America 2, Italy 4, Spain 7, Soviet Union 8, Japan 20-25, China 25-30. For those with an annual income of 10,000 yuan, the proportions were: England 0.8, France 1, America 4.2, Italy 4, Spain 5, Soviet Union 8, Japan 10-20, China 30.</p>
<p>But we are behind in everything, poor in everything, and helpless in everything. Only in the extravagance of marriage expenses do we almost rank first. This may be because we are a country of etiquette, so we regard the marriage of women and men as a "lifelong event." Usually, we are stingy and narrow-minded, but when it comes to marriage, we are very generous, even pulling, borrowing, and selling are not hesitated. Why bother? There is only one reason: to save face. To look good.</p>
<p>In this way, it is indeed difficult to make marriage a "lifelong event." Just think, to marry a wife, from hiring a matchmaker to paying dowry, asking for a name, all the way to welcoming the bride, everything must be done through the eye of Confucius. If all items are implemented in accordance with the old etiquette, how many of the 200 million men can afford it and dare to ask for it? Even marrying off a daughter, making dowries, and rushing to prepare dowries are also a costly burden. Therefore, some people say that wanting a woman is equivalent to buying a beautiful car. The price is very expensive, and the subsequent consumption expenses are also appalling. I think this is the truth of someone who has experienced it firsthand.</p>
<p>Social figures have seen this biased phenomenon and specially proposed a frugal marriage movement, and promoted and implemented it. This pioneering move that sees through the evils of the times is indeed of great benefit to society. Group wedding is one of them. It is said that Beijing City decided last year to solicit 50 pairs of new couples, pay a marriage fee of ten yuan, and plan to hold the wedding ceremony in the Huiren Hall in Zhongnanhai on New Year's Day this year. Although I don't know how the following article is, the fact that Shanghai will hold the first group wedding ceremony on April 3 has already happened. I think this is a great convenience for those who regard marriage as buying a car.</p>

<p>Arriving home, I feel that my hometown is still lovely, but my feelings for my hometown are not the same as when I left home. Firstly, my hometown is very unfamiliar to me. Secondly, even at home, things are very different from before.</p>
<p>On the first day I arrived home, among the children who came to visit me, I recognized very few. A feeling of sadness immediately rushed to my heart: Where are my childhood companions? I couldn't help but shout! At the same time, I also felt that soon after, this group of crying companions would probably feel the sadness of losing their flock like us.</p>
<p>My childhood companions, like me, were whipped by life to unknown distant places. They probably don't have any lingering feelings for their hometown, do they? What does the hometown give them? It is distress, it is hunger; the hometown cannot give them comfort, life makes them have to leave their hometown and struggle in another environment! Passing through that banana garden, that black gate, is the home of one of my childhood companions. How is that home now? His father died of illness in Nanyang, thousands of miles away, and his mother became a widow for half her life, and closed her eyes under the circumstances of green teeth and white eyes. He, alone, continued to follow in his father's footsteps and wandered in Nanyang: Is there still a home in his eyes? Ah! His home! The roof is leaking! The sun, the moon, the wind, and the rain can all be swept in from that large broken place. This is his home. Can his hometown give him comfort in his heart?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I was silent. How did my hometown change so quickly? In front of the ancestral hall, is there still the south wind of the past stealing? The scholars wearing long gowns and melon-skin hats, knocking on their pipes and talking about the harvest on the high steps? A society is declining, I think, and the ancestral hall is a symbol of it.</p>
<p>"Who is in charge of the ancestral hall's account? Why is the house so broken?" I asked my brother.</p>
<p>"Who is in charge? The ancestral hall has no account long ago! The grass is overgrown in the yard, who is in charge?" The ancestral hall is like this. I recalled the grand sacrifices in spring and autumn, the solemn and graceful scenes, still in my mind! But today, how many years have passed? Counting, it has only been six or seven years since I left home, right? How did it change so quickly?</p>
<p>"It's embarrassing! You don't know!" My brother almost sighed. He may still be nostalgic for the scenery of another society. I feel a little pity for him. He was originally a person whose spine was bent by life! His nostalgia for the declining society does not seem strange to me. I hope this society will soon come to its end, and I will welcome the arrival of another new, progressive, new society. "Let the old one stiffen, we must work hard and create a new one." I wanted to comfort my brother like this, but I didn't say it. I don't pity the decline of a society, I pity those who are old in this society and are nostalgic for the old society; even more pity those who are harmed by the old society without realizing it; they also have a tomorrow in their minds, but this tomorrow has really passed, and they don't know it.</p>
<p>Hometown has changed, and home has also changed! My father tearfully narrated the death of my mother, he said: "Mother hopes you will revitalize the family business······". I want to cry.</p>
<h3>Spring Snow</h3>
<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>Last year was extremely hot and dry, and it was predicted that this year would be extremely cold. However, the opposite was true, and the climate was warm as spring. The wheat in the countryside has already sprouted, the beans have bloomed, and some peach blossoms are in full bloom. After the great drought, the farmers in various places only place their hopes on this year, and their hopes for snow are as eager as their hopes for clouds and rain in a great drought. The winter is the dormant period for insects. When they have no ability to resist, the snowfall can wipe out the insects that harm rice in one fell swoop. After the beginning of spring, the insects begin to squirm. However, there were two snowflakes after the beginning of spring, which is a great loss in agricultural affairs.</p>
<p>In terms of human affairs, the winter was warm, and the climate was dry. Diphtheria and smallpox were very harmful everywhere. These years, it is pitiful enough to be Chinese people. Natural disasters and man-made disasters have come one after another. Nowadays, the victims in various places are displaced, and this year will be another year of famine. It is really chilling!</p>
<p>However, for the people who live in three-story western-style buildings, snowflakes are irrelevant. Occasionally, they are happy to hold beautiful women and look into the distance, admiring the jade building and the jade palace, or making a grand move to step on the snow to find plum blossoms, which is also equally great!</p>
<h3>Frosty and Snowy Morning</h3>
<p>— Luo Shan</p>
<p>Near that distant desert, in the foothills of the sunless Western Mountains in the north, when the clear days of the snowy Western Mountains emit a silvery glow, when the light red dawn shines on the snowy Western Mountains, the silvery Western Mountains glow with dazzling golden rosy clouds.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountains, in the deep valleys where the poplars sway, the shadows of the short trees are shaken, reflected on the snowy hillside, shining with reflected miracles.</p>
<p>Every morning, every morning, in the frost and dew, in the snowy morning, the black shadows are more conspicuously on the hillside.</p>
<p>Under the tiger- and lion-like roaring northwest wind, under the sharp, unyielding cold air, the cold-resistant pine trees, bamboo branches, and yellow-flowered wintersweet are there, looking around and standing on their own.</p>
<p>On the top of the mountain, the white sanatorium for tuberculosis patients with pointed tops stands alone, covered with frost and snow, as if it were a temple of ancient Greece and Rome. The sound of evening prayer bells comes from the ancient temple, shattering the hearts of every traveler with desolation.</p>
<p>The winter wind, whistling a sad tune, lingers under the yellow-flowered wintersweet, beside the holly trees, and on top of the bamboo branches.</p>
<p>There is a hermit who suffers from loneliness. He calls himself Lin Hejing, the "wife of plum blossoms and son of cranes," or Michelangelo, a famous medieval Italian painter and sculptor, and he stumbles on the hillside on frosty and snowy mornings.</p>
<p>In the mountain depressions where snowflakes float like waves and emit silver light, there is a howling sound that is as suppressed as the crying of ghosts and gods.</p>
<p>On his deep face, there is endless sorrow hidden in his heart, and there is no medicine in the world to welcome him.</p>
<p>Near that distant desert, in that sunless Western Mountain, in that clear snowy day, under the reflection of a picture-like flicker, there, there stumbles a spirit of the world.</p>
<h3>Gleaning and Others</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>It is said that it is spring again.</p>
<p>Going to the warm suburbs, perhaps those who grow up in the fields want to find some incomplete smiles and bright images of their youth from the spring grass?</p>
<p>Then, walk quietly on the muddy road; pay attention to a wild flower, a cluster of small grass, and a wandering bird skimming over the water.</p>
<p>Whether memory is the most painful or the sweetest, no one knows: however, I believe that memory is boring. Isn't it? People have no reason when they are bored. Maybe they sit there and break matches one by one, or maybe they walk in the wild and pluck a couple of weeds at will.</p>
<p>Is there ugliness in leisure? Yes, this is undeniable; but we must also understand: in a sick society, "health" does not exist.</p>
<p>(Someone started singing the Wandervogel song, thinking: I wish I could hear the tortuous sound of a six-string guitar? I wish······)</p>
<p>The idea seems to be shaking a little: This spring field of gleaning, what will we get from this?</p>
<p>But this is just like a calm mystery, and the obscure future destiny, which does not allow people to predict at all.</p>
<p>(Natural phenomena are not completely lovely; why do you only look at the pale blue flowers and the tender yellow on the wings of pink butterflies? Is it so easy to forget the mud on the small road on rainy days, and the lightning and thunder in the desolate suburbs at night?</p>
<p>A turbulent wave, a gust of wind, will not be missing on the treacherous journey: they may be as hazy as a sprig of blue flower in the spring field.</p>
<p>Have those who go to the spring suburbs to glean forgotten to worry about the gains of gleaning?)</p>
<p>I am worried, I am afraid.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people have compared "living" to "adventure"? But for me, I always feel that it is more appropriate to compare it to "gleaning in the suburbs". If life is really like an adventure, then we should be much happier; we should always be able to imagine the heroic posture of the explorer, right? Full preparation, rich luggage, energetic interest, and the facts show him··· Ahead is treacherous, we should prepare well.</p>
<p>But will anyone give you such valuable foreshadowing for those who wander on the narrow road of life?</p>
<p>Isn't living like that? Wandering like a leisurely spring suburban gleaner, perhaps everyone wants to have a bright and smooth stroll, picking up some fallen ripe fruits, picking a few green weeds, admiring and savoring them, and their thoughts are carried on a light cloud in the blue sky, slowly drifting away······</p>
<p>But the realization of that dream is not there.</p>
<p>Walking on the muddy path, if you lose your footing, you will fall into the ground; lightning and thunder will strike not far away, and the road is muddy: if you plan to glean something, then it will be withered branches and stumbling pebbles.</p>
<p>And those cold winds and rains that come upon people's inadvertentness?</p>
<p>Walking step by step on the sticky mud road, bravely pick up the unhappy dry branches and stones: people should have an old age: that's right, but when they are old, besides boasting fully about some past plights, what else is there? To say: that is "life experience".</p>
<p>I am worried: Will there also be a warm climate in spring? Does anyone dare to guarantee that the harvest of the spring field gleaner is gratifying?</p>
<p>(What is terrible is: the dryness, wetness, coldness and warmth of the seasons and)</p>
<p>The wind, rain, darkness and brightness of the climate.</p>
<p>In this era, even spring is unreliable. I remembered a poem:</p>
<p>"Few sunny days in spring, many fallen flowers in March!"</p>
<p>The gleaners in the spring wilderness must worry.</p>

<h3>Old Ju's Words</h3>
<p>— Bo Xiang</p>
<p>"What did the past year give you?" If someone asked Old Ju this way, then he could frankly answer you: "A pair of white shoes, a gray cloth robe."</p>
<p>"What else?"</p>
<p>"Tens of millions of pairs of more contemptuous eyes."</p>
<p>"What else?"</p>
<p>"Extreme insomnia and severe neurasthenia."</p>
<p>This is all he has harvested throughout the year.</p>
<p>Although he was not present in the first minute that he was given white shoes, in the long nights of insomnia, he could look at the top of the account and connect the fragmented pieces told to him by his family to create a fantasy······</p>
<p>How tragic that scene was! A person who had not yet reached the age of choking choked so quickly.</p>
<p>That was not right. From whatever point of view, with his old man's kindness and loyalty, he should not have summed up his life so quickly; if God knew, then it should admit: This is an accidental mistake.</p>
<p>But because of this accidental mistake, Old Ju's fate was decided. There was no smile on his face. Even in front of the few people who gave him bread to eat, he had to reluctantly practice a set: the smile that was forced to be pieced together with the flesh on his face was painful, like the smile of a woman selling herself on the night street. What it preserves inside is: tears, is sorrow. If you have ever met him, then you can guess his fate from his clothes: he is wearing white shoes that have been dyed gray by dust and a cloth robe stained with stains. The beard under his chin is darker than his age by a factor of two, and even though it is the New Year, he is not happy to fix it.</p>
<p>Really, the unfortunate iron hat is tightly tied to him, and even others feel unfortunate when they see it. This is not an exaggeration. Many month friends are like this, especially near the end of the year. They are all afraid that Old Ju will ask them to borrow money. They know that Old Ju's family situation is not good. When they hear him talk about that unfortunate story, this is what he often talks about, they will look at him with pity, no, actually with contempt and walk away. They all underestimated Old Ju. He just couldn't close his psychological depression and told others about his experience. He is not the kind of person who asks to borrow. He is born with a stubborn temper, willing to tighten his belt, unwilling to bow his body and ask people to open his mouth. He clearly controls the few money he earns with his labor. What does it matter if he is poor?</p>
<p>But others did not understand him, and his personality was dimmed by poverty.</p>
<p>(Accepting people's contempt aggrievedly? Some are unwilling. What to do? Unless you poke out your own eyes!)</p>
<p>He thought so alone, waking up in the quiet night. People were originally contemptuous of him, but now it has doubled. Of course, he knows the reason for this doubling: it is related to white shoes. So the scene of the old man choking is repeatedly shown in his meninges. Every night, he can always hear the first hour of the morning.</p>
<p>The more he is despised by people, the more he thinks like this, the more he thinks like this, the more he suffers from insomnia, and the more he suffers from neurasthenia: many gray cells circulate and surge in his carotid arteries, and he has spent the past year so grayly.</p>
<p>From this year on, he is prepared to keep his mouth shut and not talk to others about his own experiences.</p>

<p>However, the common people are foolish and ignorant, easily confused and difficult to understand. If they see Your Majesty like this, they will think that you sincerely serve the Buddha. Everyone will say that the Emperor is a great sage and still reverently believes. Who are the common people? How can they not cherish their lives, burn the top of their heads, burn their fingers, hundreds and thousands in groups, undress and scatter money from morning till night, imitating each other, fearing to be late, old and young running around, abandoning their occupations. If you do not immediately prohibit it, and go through other things, there will be those who cut off their arms and hurt their bodies as offerings, damaging customs and spreading laughter in all directions, which is not a trivial matter. The Buddha was originally a barbarian, whose language was not understood in China, whose clothes were different, whose mouth did not speak the words of the former kings, whose body did not wear the clothes of the former kings, who did not know the nurturing of rulers and ministers, the affection of fathers and sons. If he were still alive today, obeying his country's orders, and came to the capital to pay tribute, Your Majesty would tolerate and receive him, but after one audience, one banquet, one gift of clothes, he would be escorted out of the border, not allowing him to confuse the public.</p>

<h3>Necessary Knowledge (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xi Liu</p>
<p>Some extras think that they are just [air], so they don't need to memorize lines. Their ideal of [air] is good. In the silent film era, air originally did not speak, but since the invention of sound films, audiences hope that even those who act as air or background should have a voice. Therefore, air in the sound film era must also speak, laugh, and sing.</p>
<p>For example, if you are shooting a film about high society, then everything on the set must represent the splendor of Fifth Avenue, and extras cannot be an exception. Because the director may turn the camera around at any time, panning here and there, and the microphone may be placed here or there at any time, the extras don't know, so even when they are not in the camera's angle, their speech should be careful and conform to the standards of high society. It's not like the silent film era anymore. In the silent film era, an actor could say: [Hey, where's the beer?] and the subtitle would become: [Baby, I love you]. Because at that time, all that mattered was that the mouth could move.</p>
<p>Also, when filming, your demeanor must match the clothes you are wearing and the words you are speaking. An actor must know the customs of different people, such as how Easterners smoke cigarettes with the tip pointing upwards, while Westerners smoke with the tip pointing downwards, and so on.</p>
<p>Some films also have foreign scenes. The extras used in those scenes are French, Italian, Spanish, etc. They not only have to look authentic, but also be able to speak a few foreign languages, understand the customs of each country, and the games and songs of each country, etc. A versatile extra can play many kinds of roles. Even if we only talk about American-style roles, there are countless types. A woman may play a debutante today, a dancer tomorrow, and something else the day after tomorrow. But she must be careful not to confuse their personalities.</p>
<p>Memorizing lines is certainly something extras need to practice, but that's not enough. In the sound film era, almost every film has some music, so it would be very helpful for extras to be able to sing a few songs and play a few instruments for their future. Dancing, no matter what kind, is also very useful, because you don't necessarily need to dance in a film, but a person who can dance will have a very lively and natural figure and gait. Body language also occupies a very important position in film. Any director will agree that body language represents a person's personality and has the same potential for expression as a person's voice.</p>
<p>A good extra should be familiar with all kinds of games and sports, both indoor and outdoor, although they don't necessarily need to have deep knowledge. Film sets need people to play cards, tennis, golf, ride horses, and swim every day. Even if they are not useful for the time being, these sports can keep your body active and your mind sharp.</p>
<p>In addition, a person must have a reasonable income when working as an extra, because extras don't necessarily have work every day, and the income is very limited. At the same time, in addition to daily expenses, you must also buy clothes, hire teachers, etc. Working as an extra can't be considered a profession, but it's like going to a vocational school to be a prospective star. Of course, you can't expect the school to support you. Ten or eight years ago, working as an extra could be considered a profession and you could live off of it. But there were fewer extras back then, and the film scenes were long and needed a lot of people, so it was easy to become an actor. But now everything is different.</p>
<p>You may think that it was easier to become an actor back then, so the extras from that time have all become stars now. But that's not the case. If they don't know how to learn, they probably wouldn't even be able to keep their positions as extras now. So, learning is essential. When sound films were first invented, all films were musicals, and actors had to set aside time to learn to speak, sing, and dance in addition to their usual day and night performances. I remember that Alice White used to film during the day and practice dancing, singing, and playing the piano at home at night, and had to memorize the lines for the next day, often to the point of exhaustion. Alice White was like this, and all the big stars had to go through this stage. Otherwise, they would be naturally eliminated.</p>
<p>But what is the reward for this hard work? Victory, fame! As long as the film industry exists, there will be millions of young men and women fighting and sacrificing for that unique reward. How can you blame those twenty-odd young men and women for staying in Hollywood and not leaving? (End)</p>

In the regressive call for [women to return to the home], and in the face of the general naivety of young girls wavering between [being a pampered wife and daughter-in-law] or [dedicating themselves to sacred social service], we must emphasize its significance as a recommendation.</p>
<p>Here, the playwrights Souya Levie and Ernel Pagch, in depicting the student life of a nursing training school, show that the meaning of a woman's existence does not lie in the affections of men, but in the great and sacred cause of serving the masses.</p>
<p>The story begins with a group of lively, even naughty, girls entering a nursing school. In a life of strict management and heavy workload, they feel tired and bored; at the same time, the progress of knowledge, the vision of their careers, and the life of the group give them infinite interest and comfort.</p>
<p>Here, the producers depicted the various personalities, mutual influences, group activities, and private lives of this group of girls, as well as the humor of the serious faces of the teachers and the playful hearts of the girls intersecting, with great delicacy, care, and depth. They are both realistic and faithful records, and fresh and insightful excavations.</p>
<p>As the plot unfolds, it shifts from a collective narrative to individual development. It begins with the melancholy Xuewei, who commits suicide in a tragic act. And Qiongying, who is lively, kind, and enthusiastic, is tricked by another classmate for falsely claiming that the wealthy young man Raona, who was reported in the newspaper, is her lover, which leads to a real romance. Finally, in a man's passionate kiss, the laughter of many babies, and the sorrowful faces of patients, she moves from contradiction and distress to an honest and resolute commitment to social service, to complete the highest task of humanity.</p>
<p>The above story is extremely simple, but the producers use indirect and vivid descriptions to make the film extremely lively, bright, and full.</p>
<p>Director Irving Cumming initially used the solemn and quiet school gate to show the atmosphere inside and outside the school. The Puritanical, thin female superintendent, and the broad-minded, both strict and kind female manager; the candlelight in the solemn ceremony, the silence in the practice room, the laughter in front of the cafe; the carefulness towards patients, the teasing and playfulness towards companions... In terms of emotions, atmosphere, and personality, the director has put in considerable effort and achieved good results. Especially in terms of contrast and highlighting.</p>
<p>But it is not without flaws. Although the screenwriter avoided the clichéd ending of [lovers finally getting married], the fact that Qiongying said someone was her lover and that they actually fell in love at first sight still did not escape the Hollywood-style love performance. After Qiongying graduated, when she refused Raona's marriage proposal, Raona had already left in disappointment, and the playwright had to have a doctor come to comfort her, which was too obviously preachy. In terms of directing, the repeated appearances of the manager seriously reciting the school rules added to the solemn atmosphere of the play and earned the audience's laughter, but this was not without loss. The emphasis on church etiquette in the school ceremony, and its repeated performance, is really [adding legs to a snake] in terms of dramatic effect.</p>
<p>Due to the appropriate (casting), the actors each achieved good results. The female lead Loretta Young's passionate and compassionate girl image is more pleasing than her performance in [The Prodigal]. Perhaps it is because this [Nurse's Story] is a woman's play? The male lead John Bowers is only average. On the other hand, the school authorities, one thin and one fat, have achieved just the right effect.</p>
<h3>Review of [Hell's Highway]</h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>HEllSHighway丨Shanghai</p>
<p>Mervyn LeRoy's [I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang] shocked the American film industry, and under this influence, RKO's [Hell's Highway] appeared. Although we can glimpse commercial competition here, its starting point is to expose the darkness of American prisons, and audiences with a sense of justice do not dislike the repeated use of the same subject matter.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the play, we read the following subtitles: "Made to expose the darkness of the modern Middle Ages." This explanation of the topic clearly shows the author's intention to expose the abuse of prisoners under American law, and to further represent the suffering prisoners in demanding improved treatment from the government. We repeatedly see the warden and the road construction engineer inflicting cruel punishments on the prisoners: flogging with whips, locking them in sweatboxes until they suffocate to death, and when they are too exhausted to work, the guards think they are lazy. For losing a spoon, they are not given food. Extremely heavy shackles never leave their bodies. On the other hand, we also see the warden leisurely playing the violin, and the engineer writing a letter to the machine factory thanking them for the exquisite sweatbox. Under such cruel treatment, we see the prisoners harboring extreme resentment in their hearts. They shout loudly, "No food, no work!" They demand spoons in the dining hall, and when a spoon is lost, the warden orders that no spoons be issued. They can no longer endure this cruel treatment, they resist, they are willing to risk their lives to seize freedom. We see that the spoon becomes a sharp blade to kill the warden, they seize the guards' guns, they have a planned and organized prison break. In a shout filled with red light, their group of lawless people riot. Naturally, their resistance ultimately fails, and they are killed and wounded under the massive encirclement of the police. Although we see the sadness of their failure, the prospect of victory unfolds in this spray of blood.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not without its shortcomings. Due to the director's lack of magnificent power, and also due to the script's lack of rigorous structure, we feel that the performance is not tense enough, not stimulating enough, at least after seeing [I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang], we always feel that it lacks flavor. More importantly, there are still some inaccuracies in the content. The protagonist Duke is a hero in the film. Although the playwright explains that he has been imprisoned several times, he does not write him as an unpardonable person. On the contrary, under the cruel treatment, he is confident that there is a need to break out of prison, but for the sake of his brother's happiness, he is contradictory and temporarily suspends his heroic actions. Related to this is the fact that the government official finally arrests the engineer, implying that the government is determined to improve the treatment of prisoners, but it is only the wardens and guards who are acting arbitrarily. Improving the living conditions of prisoners was originally a requirement of the play, but unfortunately this hope will inevitably turn into a bubble in the eyes of the artist before the old system is destroyed.</p>
<p>What makes us feel gratified in the end is that the playwright did not distort the conclusion to an unacceptable degree. Although the hero Duke voluntarily returns to prison carrying his brother on his back, he does not casually receive an amnesty. In the iron gate, it is implied that the hero has fallen, assuming that he is completely submissive. On the other hand, the slaves have risen up, and the prisoners ridicule Duke for betraying the interests of his fellows. In the bloody tragedy, it is explained that today's slaves cannot live in inhuman treatment.</p>
<p>Although we cannot be entirely satisfied with this film, it is ultimately worthy of people's attention, and it has achieved great success in terms of exposure.</p>

<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>David Copperfield (6)</h3>
<p>— Willow Village</p>
<p>Although David wanted to comfort himself by thinking that what he imagined might not be true, he clearly saw that every time Amy saw Steerforth, a strange light appeared in her eyes. She didn't have that light when she saw Ham, even though Ham was her future husband. So, later, when Ham received the bad news, David seemed to have foreseen it. When Ham handed David a letter and asked him to read it to everyone, his throat was hoarse. He didn't dare to look up at the old fisherman, Ham, Mr. Peggotty, and the others. He read the letter word by word. It said:</p>
<p>"You love me more than I deserve. By the time you read this letter, I will have left you. I will never return unless I have become a noble lady and return with him. I have failed your great kindness. Please find someone else who can return your sincere love, and love her. Please just think of me as having died young and buried in an unknown place. And please tell Uncle that I have never loved him as dearly as I do now."</p>
<p>David finished reading, and the paper fluttered from his hands. Ham stood up, as if he wanted to say something, but at this moment, everyone was looking at the old fisherman. He looked furious and terrifying, and asked in a trembling voice, "Who is he? I want to know his name! Who is he?" David remembered the many things he and his classmates had said before, so he said, "Steerforth." The old fisherman heard this, immediately turned around, and walked towards the door. As he walked, he said, "I'm going to find my Amy, no matter how far away. I will find her and bring her back. No one can stop me." Of course, no one could stop him. So he set off to start searching, traveled all over the world, and endured countless years of wind and frost.</p>
<p>After the old fisherman left, David couldn't think of anything else to do but quietly leave that place where they had once gathered and celebrated, and return to London. In London, month after month passed. Although he was often worried about his friends at Doctor's Commons, his own life was filled with important things. His usual writing aspirations had now received some reward, because one of his novels had been published in a monthly magazine. But this victory was nothing, because Dora had agreed to be his wife. So he immediately ran to Canterbury to tell his aunt, Betsey, and his teacher, Wickfield, and Agnes, about the happiness Dora had given him. He was so intoxicated with his own happiness that he didn't even notice the sorrow and disappointment in Agnes's eyes.</p>
<p>Poor Agnes, since David left, she had become uninterested in everything. Her father had brought Uriah Heep in as a partner in his business. Uriah seemed to manipulate Wickfield at will. Uriah slept in the room David used to sleep in. Although Wickfield himself said that his promotion of Uriah was his own wish, no one believed that. However, Micawber couldn't tell David what power Uriah had to play Wickfield in the palm of his hand, to the point where he was so bold and reckless as to ask Wickfield to marry Agnes to him. This was Wickfield's first outburst of anger in many years. This ignorant Heep actually wanted to be matched with Agnes. Even Uriah, the humble Uriah, knew afterwards that he had gone too far.</p>
<p>The day of David and Dora's wedding arrived. At that time, even Wickfield's family and the difficulties in Wickfield's home were temporarily put out of David's mind. Dora, his baby wife, was a woman with only looks and no ability to do anything. She couldn't even keep track of the daily household accounts. She didn't know how to cook, let alone manage household affairs or servants. Soon, his home was in complete disarray. David's study was a mess, but David was deeply in love with Dora and their affection was unwavering. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A General Overview of Shanghai Construction in the Past Year (1)</h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and another year has passed so quickly. Looking back at Shanghai's construction in the past year, although the world's economic panic is still deeply serious, and the domestic rural bankruptcy has been compounded by an unprecedented drought, making it even more acute, Shanghai's construction is still very developed. This may make people suspicious, but in Shanghai, the base of imperialism, the development of construction is a natural phenomenon, and there is nothing to doubt. Precisely because of this, it can further promote the progress and development of Shanghai's construction. Actions speak louder than words. The facts are before our eyes. The completion of tall buildings and the completion of new halls and houses appear one after another. We can also observe from the population that it is increasing every day. According to the population statistics for November of last year, the total number of people was 3,446,4528, an increase of 15,374 people compared to the 3,449,154 people in October of the same year. Do these not prove the reasons for the development of Shanghai's construction? Therefore, no one will deny the development of Shanghai's construction. Now, the total value of construction in the past eight years is listed below, which can also give us a clear understanding of Shanghai's construction situation.</p>
<p>1927: 15,263,552 taels</p>
<p>1928: 32,356,986 taels</p>
<p>1929: 45,386,682 taels</p>
<p>1930: 71,511,816 taels</p>
<p>1931: 62,351,250 taels</p>
<p>1932: 35,541,009 taels</p>
<p>1933: 72,175,000 yuan</p>
<p>1934: 55,880,000 yuan</p>
<p>In the table above, the total value of construction last year only includes the total from January to the end of October, and November and December have not yet been included! If we calculate the total number of months for ten months, then, of course, there will be another 11 million yuan to be added for November and December. Although it is slightly lower than the value in 1933, we should understand here that the decline in the price of building materials last year compared to 1933 is an ironclad fact. Not only building materials, but also the prices of everything, were also slightly lower than in 1933! Therefore, Shanghai's construction last year was still developing. Now, according to the current administrative divisions, Shanghai's construction can be divided into the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the city area. In order to understand the construction situation in each district last year, we have to discuss it separately below. In fact, this is worth studying.</p>
<p>Now, let's first talk about the Public Concession! The total construction amount in the Public Concession in the ten months of last year was 25,212,000 yuan, accounting for 50% of the total construction amount in the city. Originally, Shanghai's construction could be represented by the Public Concession alone. Therefore, its construction costs have always been more than half of the total over the years. This is due to the environment. In the first six months of last year, new construction projects were worth 16,233,000 yuan, accounting for 45% of the total value of the city. Among these, the central district accounted for 31%, the western Shanghai district accounted for 34%, the eastern Shanghai district accounted for 30%, and the northern Shanghai district accounted for only 5%. Compared with the same period in 1933, it decreased by 10%. In the construction cost of 16,233,000 yuan, a total of 2,013 construction licenses were issued, including 88 Chinese-style houses built in the central district, 44 Western-style shops, 1 Western-style residence, 2 bank buildings, 1 office, 1 factory, and 3 garages. In the eastern Shanghai district, 460 Chinese-style halls and houses, 1 Western-style residence, 4 staff dormitories, 12 factories, 1 yarn factory, 46 other factory buildings, 6 warehouses, and 1 office were built. In the western Shanghai district, 935 Chinese-style houses, 93 Western-style shops, 97 Western-style residences, 2 apartments, 4 staff dormitories, 3 factories, 3 other factory buildings, 1 school, 3 warehouses, and 27 garages were built. In the northern Shanghai district, 164 Chinese-style halls and houses, 7 Western-style shops, 1 apartment, 1 school, and 1 garage were built. As for the halls and houses demolished and rebuilt, there were 713 Chinese-style halls and houses and 45 Western-style halls and houses. The construction value in July and August was 5,075,000 yuan, with 2,079,000 yuan in July and 2,996,000 yuan in August, which was better than July. The construction in the western Shanghai district accounted for more than 50% of the total value in the two months, including 153 Chinese-style halls and houses, 26 Western-style residences, 1 hotel, 3 schools, and 3 factories. In the eastern Shanghai district, 326 Chinese-style residences, 41 Western-style shops, 3 factories, 23 other factory halls and houses, and 4 warehouses were built. As for the construction value in the central district, it was 648,000 yuan, and in the northern Shanghai district, it was 325,000 yuan. Although no construction classification is given to us clearly, we can also know the general situation of its construction. The construction in September and October was slightly lower than in the same period in 1933, only 3,905,000 yuan, and the eastern Shanghai district accounted for the majority! A total of 206 Chinese-style halls and houses, 5 offices, 12 Western-style residences, and 18 industrial factory halls were built. In the western Shanghai district, more than 30 Western-style halls and houses were built. The central district accounted for 23% of the construction amount, and the northern Shanghai district accounted for only 7%. Here, the details of the construction in the Public Concession are clear. And the result is that the construction in the western Shanghai district and the eastern Shanghai district is more developed than in the central district. This is because the buildings in the central district are already everywhere, and we all know that there is no room for construction. Therefore, we have to build in the eastern district and the western district. The eastern district and the western district have become the factory area and residential area of Shanghai, so the construction of their buildings is mostly factory halls and houses and residences. As mentioned above, the buildings in the eastern Shanghai district and the western Shanghai district in the ten months of last year can clearly show the trend of their buildings. Now, the out-of-bounds road construction area negotiated by the authorities is the eastern Shanghai district and the western Shanghai district of the Public Concession, because the eastern Shanghai district and the western Shanghai district have more room for development than the central district, so most of the construction last year was also in these two districts.</p>
<h3>Steel and Its Protection Methods (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Steel has long been used in construction, but its importance and ease of use have become more and more prominent in recent decades. Roughly speaking, its advantages are five: 1) non-combustible, 2) no shrinkage, 3) strong material, 4) no need to worry about worm infestation, 5) easy to make various styles. There are many common steel frame structures, and more than a hundred types have been invented and successfully used by architects over the years, but they all do not go beyond the four categories of rolled steel profiles, steel plates, steel sheets, or steel bars. Their application may be for roofs, or as wall frames, or as materials for window frames, or for the laying of floors, etc. There is also the invention of stainless steel in recent times, which is widely used in kitchens, bathrooms, and other places, and its development seems to be still in full swing.</p>
<p>Steel is so important in construction and so widely used, so if we want to explore its physics and understand its use in detail, it cannot be fully covered in a few words. What is described here is only thin steel material, including only steel sheets and steel bars. However. This kind of steel material is indeed the focus of modern architects' research on its application methods to improve construction, so it is no coincidence that we choose to discuss this.</p>
<p>Steel sheets and steel bars have many similarities, the only difference is their length, width, and narrowness. Ordinary people often have a doubt, what is the difference between steel plates and steel sheets? Regarding this point, if we only use their thickness as a boundary, it is indeed confusing. According to American regulations, the thickness of steel sheets should not exceed the thickness of standard No. 10 copper wire, which is roughly less than 9/64 inches, while the thinnest limit of steel plates is 3/16 inches. However, this regulation has determined the difference between steel sheets and steel plates, and there are even clearer distinctions, that is, depending on the required properties of the material. Steel plates are mostly used for their strength and toughness, while steel sheets require more surface perfection, and there are large differences in manufacturing methods.</p>
<p>Steel sheets and steel bars must have the following three elements:</p>
<p>1) Strength for construction</p>
<p>2) Connectability and methods</p>
<p>3) Durability (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Medieval Architecture (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The Gothic architectural method is also ingeniously varied, unlike the Romanesque style which is so rigid. Its variation often depends on the location, scale, and other special circumstances. When we see the Acropolis temple built by the Greeks in Athens, its roof had to be low and flat because it was meant to suit its position. However, Gothic temples, built on the peaks of mountains in sacred areas, not only stand on the mountain, with a magnificent atmosphere, but also add beauty to the mountains and rivers, enhancing the beauty of nature. This means that people's psychology is gradually loving a kind of adventurous, mysterious, and strange architectural form. These characteristics all require people to express them with courageous strength, so we should not be surprised that the origin and development of this Gothic architectural style is in the north of Europe, where the climate is cold, and the people are strong and full of adventurous spirit.</p>
<p>The rise of the Gothic style was very rapid, and its spread throughout Europe was also very extensive, creating an indelible page in the history of architecture. However, the times are constantly progressing, human thought is constantly changing, and the world's culture is constantly advancing and expanding. Therefore, this Gothic architecture, after three hundred years, eventually became an inevitable laggard. Their previous prosperity no longer exists. Its courageous and adventurous characteristics have also been abandoned, and at the same time, people have another kind of concept and ambition growing in their endless historical journey.</p>
<h3>New-Style Residential Architecture and Sanitary Design (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xi Hao</p>
<p>The relationship of lighting is even more important to the health of the whole body and mind. Every engineer should carefully study the volume of the residence and the configuration of the lighting. Excessively strong light will cause your nerves to be over-stimulated. Strong light will cause your nerves to be over-stimulated and produce an abnormal mental response. Too dim light will cause your spirit to be unexpectedly consumed. Both of these situations are harmful to health. The configuration of the wall's reflective effect is even more important in lighting. All excessively exciting decorations must be avoided as much as possible. Pale yellow or egg-yellow decorations have been proven to have excellent reflective effects.</p>
<p>The third major issue in sanitary design is the equipment of the entire residence. A convenient supply of water and electricity is sufficient to save the owner's energy and increase a lot of comfort. The bathroom is an indispensable thing in new-style residential architecture. It is often seen that a very good residence has good equipment, but lacks the most needed bathroom, and loses its value. The equipment in the bathroom does not have to be very luxurious, "easy to clean" is the most important issue in bathroom design.</p>
<p>Secondly, a suitably sized courtyard is a necessary accessory in new-style architecture. The owner can use it as a place for physical and mental recreation, or as a small-scale exercise yard. In new-style residences in Europe and the United States, small lawns or dirt courtyards are equipped, where family members and children can play tennis, small football, and other games, which not only increases the joy of life, but also gradually exercises the physique of the entire family. Our country's engineers may as well adopt this excellent sanitary design as much as possible.</p>
<p>The above are just the largest points, and are what general architects should strictly pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Recently, since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has strictly enforced the Industrial Technician Registration Law, it is almost difficult to become a technician without a formal school diploma. Especially for architectural engineering talents, there is a greater lack. Therefore, universities in the country have added architecture departments to meet the needs. In the past year, several new architectural specialty evening schools have appeared, even in Shanghai alone. Among them, such as the Shanghai University Architecture Specialty Evening School on Yuanmingyuan Road, and the Architectural Engineering Evening School of the Lester Institute in Hongkou, both have comprehensive equipment and complete courses, and invite domestic architectural experts to help young people who have no opportunity to study in order to seek a bright future. However, there are also quite a few people who use this as a speculative business, use false words to attract students, use foreigners to swagger and deceive, collect large amounts of tuition fees, and mislead young people. Recently, such as a certain vocational school found on Jiangxi Road, which widely distributes leaflets, saying that it teaches higher architectural subjects, with only four hours of instruction per week, and graduates in half a year, and shamelessly uses registration as a technician with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as bait, charging as much as dozens of yuan per month, its fraudulent behavior is self-evident. I hope that our architectural youth will not be deceived by it, and that the education authorities should also find ways to ban it. If you are kind enough to publish the above situation, I will be publicly grateful. I wish you peace. I humbly request above.</p>
