<p>時評</p>
<h3>監獄之疏通與改善</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>近年來我國農村破產。民生憔悴民。間作奸犯科之事。與日俱增各。地監獄。均患人滿而。設備比較完善之新式監獄。其收容人犯。亦多超過定額一倍以上夫。以容額有限之監獄收。禁激增不已之人。犯必至個別監房化。爲雜處工。塲敎室移。充宿舍。遑論感化政策。無從貫澈。卽管理給養。亦難得當。無知小民。偶罹法網。被處徒。刑因獄中人數過多。隔離困難。往往與惡性犯人相接。觸感受惡習。愈趨墮落。至因羣囚雜居。病菌蕃滋。致在獄中喪其生命。其情尤爲可憫。頃者司法院有鑒及此。擬具减刑辦法。呈候中央核准施行以。冀疏通監犯。此誠切要之圖也。</p>
<p>疏通監犯。本有緩刑與假釋等辦法。第以年來罪犯激增。新舊監獄均難容納。故二年前司法當局曾建議以減刑濟緩刑假釋之窮。後中政會決予緩議。此案迄未舉辦。但二年以來。罪犯遞增。尤甚於前。監獄更爲擁擠。司法當局乃於今年五六月間。擬具减刑辦法。重申前請當。經中政會交法制組與立法司法兩院及軍政海軍兩部。派員會同審査主。改减刑辦法爲假釋辦法。交立法院審議立。法院審査結果決。改假釋辦法爲疏通監獄暫行條例於。七月三日提出該院全體會議通過。行見明令公佈施行。各地監獄人滿之患。藉此當可可稍稍解除矣。</p>
<p>疏通監獄之外。監獄之改良在今日亦有必要我。國監獄。舊式者占百分之九十以上類。多湫溢污穢醫。藥設備更屬簡陋。依照科刑卽所以改善犯人之旨監。獄設備與。監犯待遇均。應積極改良使。司法之眞精神得以充分發揮。此所望於司法當局就。可能範圍以內。與疏通監獄同時並行者也。</p>
<p>雖然。監獄之疏通及改蕃。僅可謂爲治標的辦法。欲求社會方面罪惡成分之减少。尙須從根本方面着想。澄淸吏治安。定民生。消弭犯罪之動機。杜絕罪犯之來源。古人有方。『釜底抽薪勝於揚湯止沸』其此之謂　。</p>
<h3>霍爾外相宣佈　英國遠東政策　重申維持門戶開放　承認中國有自主權</h3>
<p>（倫敦）包爾溫所領導之舉國一致的政府成立未久、昨夜復在下院受第二次試騐、而獲顯著之勝利、蓋工黨動議减輕外交預算經費、卒爲二三六對四〇票所否决也、</p>
<p>自包爾溫秉政後、昨爲下院第一次辯論外交事件、外相霍爾曾發英國遠東政策之重要言論、霍氏謂政府深信中國趨向治安與安固之穩健的進步、欲予維持則唯有增進中日間之良好關係、及中日與其他有相同利益目的之各國間相互合作之一道耳、一言以蔽之、維持開放門戶之原則、充分承認中國有控制其自己運命之權，仍爲英國政策之廣大基礎、中國如須恢復在世界上其歷史的地位、則其需助於西方者、不减於東方、外相於是乃切實聲明英政府之注重中英關係、而舉駐華英使署昇格爲大使署、在南京設備較善之英大使駐紮所、及遣派經濟顧問主任羅斯爵士負重要經濟使命赴華諸事爲證、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>辯論外交政策　英下院大舌戰　工黨責政府處事一味遷就　使國聯威信掃地難辭其咎</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相霍爾於昨日午後在下議院發表關於外交政策之重要演說、對於英德海軍協定·歐洲安全組織·意阿爭端·英國與各國外交關係·以及遠東問題、靡不詳加闡述、此爲英國政府所作對外政策之重要宣言、茲摘述大意如下、</p>
<p>解釋英德恊定</p>
<p>霍爾外相首先說明英德海軍恊定、「謂英德海軍協定絕非自私自利之條約、任何恊定凡吾人視爲不利於其他海軍國者、吾人决不簽訂之、卽以法國而論、英德恊定之締結、實際上使法國海軍地位、較戰前大爲穩固、以法國現有之海軍實力與英德相較、則英德協定實使法國海軍永遠超越德國百分之四十三、而在戰前、則法國海軍僅及德國百分之七十、英德協定有利於法國、於此可見、抑重視理論者與重視實際經騐者、其所見往往不同、此層余亦深知之、但無論如何、英國政府所採取之實際政策、倘有助於和平、則對世界實已可吿無罪、友邦人士不加審察、對於吾國之實際主義政策或有所批評、則余願吿之曰、各友邦過去亦曾單獨締結國際協定、以謀維護本國安全及利益、此類協定旣無損於他國、故亦並未向他國徵詢意見、彼時英國政府對之、不惟不加批評、甚且竭誠贊助以促成之、此種精神、政府今日仍屬相同、且將永遠保持之也、」</p>
<p>贊助集體安全</p>
<p>外相旋述及集體安全組織問題、謂「英國政府今後對於歐洲各種紛擾、雖不願捲入漩渦、但苟有助於紛擾之解决、則斷不願置身事外、歐洲多數國家視中歐及東歐爲危險地點、此等國家吾人在此不必列舉其名、其中數國甚至抱有一種見解、以爲西歐國家如單獨訂立天空公約一類之協定、而不與其他各項和平問題同時解決、則結果將在東歐方面引起較目前尤爲凶險之危機、此種杞憂、余雖未敢苟同、但余並不否認、戰事如果一旦在東歐或中歐爆發、依吾人之經騐推測、未始不可牽動全局、　成巨刧、惟其如此、吾人今日正應急起直追、將足以引起危機之現存困難、力謀解决、英國政府盼望東歐及多瑙河各國互不侵犯條約儘速簽字、最爲迫切、然此則又當視德國元首希特勒能否眞誠參加和平事業以爲斷耳、希特勒苟能參加和平工作、則歐洲多數國家將消釋其種種之殷憂、不但在東歐及中歐方面爲然、卽在西歐諸國亦然、是故余將慫恿希特勒爲和平努力、且余意渠如出此、則不惟全歐沐惠、德國本身亦與有利也、所望希特勒於此時採取必要之手段、以促進東歐及多瑙河各國締結互不侵犯條約之談判、此於締結天空公約一舉、亦將有莫大之帮助、蓋余知天空公約實現、固爲希特勒所願望者也、抑奧國在歐洲所處之地位、不論在軍事上或經濟上均爲一重要樞紐、奧國地位如一旦發生任何變更、則歐洲和平之基礎、必將爲之動搖、因此凡奧國政府及人民爲維持並增强其獨立存在所作之一切努力、吾人當繼續以最同情最殷切之態度加以關切、多瑙河各國締結互不侵犯條約及相互不干涉內政公約之一事、英國政府所以切望其實現者、維持奧國地位實爲其理由之一也、要之欲保持「不干涉隣國內政之原則」、則必先使各國足以自保、且願自保而後可、吾人固當竭盡一切、以謀和平與建設、但徒託空言無濟於事、此必吾人有正當之防衛措置與防衛行動而後可、英國政府始終不忘現實主義之政策、苟其不然、則殊有虧於集體和平之責任矣、」（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>提及意阿問題</p>
<p>外相旋言及阿比西尼亞事、謂英國極欲保持國聯賴以成立之原則吾人無他目的、但欲和平解决耳、外傳吾人專以殖民地利益爲念、而駐重兵於毘連的英殖民地之說、完全未有根據、吾人了解意國海外開拓之願望、並承認其責備阿政府若干點之正當、但意國需要開拓之事實、及對於阿政府之責言、詎可爲開戰之充分理由乎、英政府現設法欲藉一九零六年條約與國聯、以挽回浩刦、至於英政府曾請法政府加入施諸意國之封鎖、及英國準備單獨行動威脅意國之說、悉屬謠言、絕非事實、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>增進各國友誼</p>
<p>外相後言及英國對於中國及法意美俄日之交誼、謂英俄關係現甚友好、爲蘇俄政府成立以來所未有云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>至於法國與吾人和衷同濟、已三十年於茲、英法友誼之歷久不變、有非出於偶然者、一則兩國均採取自由主義之政治學說、此層每爲一般人所忽略、二則兩國同爲西歐國家、唇齒相依休戚與共、三則一九一九年巴黎和會解決歐洲問題、英法實負共同之責任、今巴黎和會所建立解決歐洲問題之方案、已有改弦更張之必要、繫鈴解鈴是在英法共負其責職是之故、二月三日英法倫敦宣言書及斯德萊柴會議公報所確定之英法合作、必當予以保持、然所常聲明者、則吾人一方面固應顧及舊友、另一方面仍應不妨其另覓新交是也、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>工黨痛詆政府</p>
<p>（倫敦）昨夜下院會議之特點、爲議員瓊斯代表工黨卽反對黨結束辯論時所發痛詆政府辦事遲鈍之言論、及歐戰時英國首相勞合喬治所發政府已使國聯喪失威信之言論、瓊斯謂政府對華太晚、對德太晚、今對於阿比西尼亞幾亦太晚、政府對於弱小諸國、未嘗不奮勉而有確定之主張、但一旦有一狂噪之大威嚇者出現、則卽遁走、</p>
<p>艾登否認割地</p>
<p>至是不管部閣員艾登急起作答曰、任何人如以爲英國於覔求和解時、應割讓其自己之土地、此將爲今後英國政策之特點、余必切實否認此說、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>勞合大逞詞鋒</p>
<p>於是勞合喬治挿言曰、國聯整個機關之威信已墮地矣、日本曾違抗國聯、橫行中國、由一省而達他省、甚至巴拉圭與玻璃維亞亦蔑視國聯、互戰不已、終乃自休、德國嘗侮弄國聯、意國今亦效尤之矣、每次各國集於日內瓦、欲使國聯盟約見諸實施時、輒將其工作置諸傖夫手中、致合作喪失、德國海陸空軍依然存在、國聯始終在一堆廢紙上耳、郝爾與艾登應了解軍縮機關已完全消滅、而和解機關亦不復爲人信任之可悲的事實、必須另行設法使各國得團結一致、以保全文化免遭鉅刦云、</p>
<p>張伯倫答辯</p>
<p>前外相張伯倫繼起發言、與勞合喬治所言者適相反、致雙方大起舌戰、但喬治最後聲稱、張伯倫乃榘所最不願冒犯之人、於是爭論頓息、據張伯倫之意見、英國明顯的途徑、在立於日內瓦行政院議案前而聲明英國準備履行其義務、</p>
<p>當瓊斯起立爲反對黨作結束之辯論時、電燈忽熄、全塲漆黑、瓊斯在燭光黯淡之中對衆大言、氣不稍衰、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>英外相言論　羅馬歡迎巴黎滿意　國際陰霾一舉而廓淸　足啓未來談判新途徑</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外相赫爾昨在下院發言後、歐洲各國對此之反饗、大都美滿、其所發關於國聯之議論、已引起日瓦內多大之欣慰、蓋覺英國對於歐洲問題及集體安全制度之態度、現有切實美滿之變更也、外相言論已造成羅馬良好印象、但外相論調、意人雖認爲滿意、然意國報紙則謂英國新態度將有何種影饗、現尙未可逆覩、意國猶待其發展云、英外相所言意阿爭議一節、羅馬人士頗歡迎之、視爲英國態度之進步、而英國不允以軍火接濟阿比西尼亞之消息、亦爲意人所歡迎、惟羅馬民報則謂僅聲明英國未有社意、尙屬不足、必須以事實證明之云、法國報紙大都歡迎英外相之言、覺其議論頗可恢復英法尋常關係、外交方面亦對於英外相所發英法合作之有力主張、表示滿意、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>法意輿論良好印象</h3>
<p>（巴黎）外交界人士對於英國霍爾外相、在下議院所作宣言、甚表歡迎、並因霍爾述及天空公約時、曾謂「此項公約應由有關係之五國（指英法意德比）共同訂立、」可見英德不致訂立雙方條約、故尤表滿意、消息靈通人士以爲關於此事之談判、不日卽可進行、並說明英國繼續贊成用集體政策組織和平、觀於霍爾演說、可以瞭然云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國外相霍爾昨日午後在下議院發表重要演說、說明該國外交政策、此間各報頃發表評論、均認爲滿意、右派斐迦羅報載稱、「此項演說定可將國際陰霾、一舉廓淸、並可使歐洲各國所進行之談判、重行納於良善意識之中、換言之、卽眞正之集體意識、亦卽眞正之建設意識」社會黨人民報載稱、「英國下議院昨日開會時、若有一陣祥氣經過也者、定能將英國政策中之黴菌一掃而空、」共產黨機關報人道報載稱、「霍爾謂和平不可分割此言實有至理、特空言無補、須當以行爲證實之耳、」事業報載稱、「英人對於阿比西尼亞問題，希望能由英法意三國從速舉行談判、以謀解決、此旨實昭然若揭、要之、霍爾此次演詞、可謂國際間行將開始之外交談話作先容、自屬佳事、而此項談話、德國亦必積極參加」小巴黎人報謂、「霍爾演詞旣合現實主義而又高尙、足爲未來國際談判之良好朕兆、英國頃已返歸二月三日英法倫敦宣言書及斯德萊薩決議案所明定之範圍、一般人因而戚有暢快之印象、抑霍爾道及英法兩國友誼時詞意懇摯、直叩法人心弦、」晨報謂、一霍爾昨以明白之語、要求德國簽訂多瑙河公約東歐公約、此與法國政府見解適相契合、法國方面自亦樂於報可」云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意大利各報評論英國外相霍爾在下院之言論、一致注重英國承認意大利有擴展殆民地權利之一點、同時霍爾吾認將對意大利採取任何脅迫之聲明及其承認奧國獨立有維持之必要、皆使此間獲得充分之滿意、意大利民報聲稱、英外相之所言雖屬陳言、然其音調則爲全然之新音調、霍氏重申英意傳統友誼之言詞、及其對於斯特拉薩三國陣綫依然有效之聲明、已於意大利獲得良好之反應云、其中吹毛求疵者僅有一郵報、據該報之意、英國對於意阿問題之眞態度獨難捉摸、蓋今日英國之態度雖較爲穩健、然其仍欲袒護阿國之意、則殊爲明顯也、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>英報論調毀譽參半</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相霍爾昨在下院所發之言論、今晨各報加以評論、毀譽參半、泰晤士報稱、外相之言、已明白表示一二途徑沿此進行、可達到穩固公道與和平之目的云、晨郵報稱、此番辯論後、所謂集體安全者、或所謂國聯者、殆已靡有孑遺吾人唯一希望、厥爲本國有實際知覺、而消毀幻想耳、每日郵報稱、外相之言、令人心定、而不作國聯狂熱派之荒謬呼號、此輩固願英國採行針砭意國之政策、彙聞報稱、外相關於政府對國聯態度之一　論、未可反對、但外國應付現狀中眞正難題時、就國聯而言、其舉動殊形空泛、不若此宣言之直截了當也、每日捷報稱、外相聲明政府擁護國聯、但並未有何舉動以探詢他國是否準備參加集體的動作、外相承認意國海外開拓之需要、並言及一九零六年條約之運用據此條約、阿比西尼亞早將被分爲若干經濟勢力圈、此非所以保全和平之道、但爲鼓勵戰爭之策、現有保障和平之唯一機會、厥爲不獨在言語上、且須在行爲上矢忠於國聯耳云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>柏林方面暫無表示</h3>
<p>德元首希特勒將取英外相之言論作密切之研究、故暫時德國官塲不願表示任何意見、就一般輿論觀之、英外相之言論「造成良好印象、惟覺中歐公約過於複雜德國與聞其事是否安全、則柏林人士終不能無疑也、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德意志總匯報評論英國外相霍爾昨日在下議院所發表之演說、略謂霍爾演說之要點、乃在謀英法之合作、蓋英國將何以安慰法國、聯絡法國、說服法國、此固爲舉世所欲知者、今霍爾已明白言之矣、英國所以需要與法國合作、則以凡爾賽條約須加以修改故也、霍爾蓋深願英法合作、以從事修改條約云、柏林日報則謂、英國新任外相霍爾、已表示當重行採取法國之政策大綱、此則恰與英國政策之需要相適合、要之、英國政策有種種需要爲吾人所不當忘、吾人不當沉醉於英德海軍協定、以爲舍此以外、舉世更無其他問題云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國一諾和平可期</h3>
<p>維也納　英國外相霍爾在下院演說、主張必須維持奧國獨立、並應迅速訂結多瑙河公約、因此「維也納日報」對於霍爾演說所促成之歐洲國際局勢、頗抱樂觀、謂「英國外相已確定和平之途徑、今後全歐洲惟待希特勒一言以決」云、半官機關之聯邦郵報則謂、「英國外相業向希特勒明白指示、倘無多瑙河及東　公約、則天空羅加諾公約亦不克成立」云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<h3>匈報注意修約一點</h3>
<p>匈牙利京城　匈牙利輿論、對於英國外相霍爾之演說、認爲足以鼓勵修改和約政策、對於霍爾演說中所稱、變更一九一九年所造成之局面、以謀持久和平之一語、各報特加以注意、親德派之「匈牙利日報」謂「和約足使歐洲和平遭嚴重之損害、此層霍爾頗爲瞭解」云、超然派之「匈京日報」則謂、「德國對於奧國獨立問題態度曖昧不明、且自德國單方面廢止凡爾賽條約軍事條欵後、法對德、卽存疑忌、此兩事爲切實解決歐洲問題之最大障碍、今霍爾似將建議舉行國際政治談話以使希特勒明白表示態度」云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本不願遽加批評</h3>

<h3>豫省　偃師縣城陸沉　隴海西段山洪暴發偃師淹斃人命千餘</h3>
<p>徐州通信、隴海西段、陝中豫西一帶、先後大雨、山洪暴發、水勢甚大、潼關西安間之交通、自六日起阻斷、而偃師附近、又爲洪水沒軌、茲分紀詳情如次、</p>
<p>潼西路阻</p>
<p>西安初感亢旱、以接大雨連日、三晝夜不止、以致各河水漲、西安附近之　橋滻橋、均於橘角稍有損壞、雖不碍行車、惟該段路基、係屬新築、未免鬆而不實、而華陰以東至東華店之路基、雖塡築比較爲早、亦呈鬆動之象、路局爲保護行車安全計、通令延站只售至潼關爲止客票、車達潼關而後、以非正式之行車、尙可到達西安、頃據路方人談、潼西路基、幷無大損、只以新築士鬆之故、非天睛經烈日之照晒、不能修補堅實、刻慢車已達渭南、度一週以內、快車可以復達西安矣、</p>
<p>偃師淹沒</p>
<p>偃師城　在隴海路之南二里、伊洛兩水夾之、地勢極窪、前歲洛水漲溢、灌城一次、經一兩月之久、尙有積水、其低可知、八日之晨、嵩山一帶山洪暴發、下注洛水、洛水河道、本來欠浚、至是陡容巨量之水、乃出岸橫溢、偃師城本有護城大隄、無如水勢太猛、決隄而過、城內人民、初尙荷鉀奔出、擬集衆搶護大隄、詎山洪由高及下、洛水灌城、亦係由高及下、至當日午後、已浸隄而過、人民乃棄其家室器具、相率奔逃、或踞　隄、或蹲城頭、據傳八日之晚、水勢幾與城齊、車過偃師站時、但見一片茫茫、只露樹杪、城外關帝廟、亦僅能見及鴟吻、人民淹斃千餘、什物漂沒、觸目皆是、至損失之統計、刻尙無從調査、</p>
<p>涉水行車</p>
<p>洛水灌偃師而後由南向北橫流以至偃師站附近、水皆平軌、而在偃師車站迤東道牌八十號至八十四號之問、長約五六里、以路基稍低、水竟沒軌一尺、泛濫北流、所幸該段路基、係屬舊築飽經風吹日晒、雨蝕水浸、未有損壞基址亦固、路局因仍令涉水行車、以維交通、八九兩日、客車往來過偃師者、均以壓道車前導、徐經涉水而過、計度此一段水程、需三小時之久、故交通得未停止、是以徐站始終均售至潼關客票、外傳西車只通鄭州者、絕對不確、九日晚、水落六尺、路某已露出十一日西車、當可准時到站、</p>
<p>溢水入河</p>
<p>洛水本由偃師之南、向東北流、當水勢橫溢濫浸無歸之際、不分河道田野、但洛水水道、係流經鞏縣、因之泛水順流至鞏、大部瀉人黄河、路方正在修補路基、惟偃師城內之水、雖稍低落、但以地窪之故、不能外流、須用抽水機始能撤出、據一般判斷、隴海西段沿途、以鞏縣偃師兩縣城最低、鞏縣前經遷治、偃師似亦非遷治、不能防水患也、（十日）</p>

<p>精鹽通銷後　擬請鹽務增加銷額　以期產銷平衝維持營業　致引起粗鹽商激烈反對</p>
<p>實業社云、精監業通銷問題、早經財政部鹽務署核定產額與銷額、粗鹽商現在激烈反對、該精鹽業擬請鹽務署增加銷額、以資救濟、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>鹽務核定產銷數額</p>
<p>國內精鹽之發明、始於民國三年、全國製造廠商計有久大·通益·永裕通達·五和·民生·等六大公司、員工合計一萬二千餘人、當初僅能銷售通商口岸、銷數僅達產額百分之三十一、以致供過于求、營業難以維持、曾於去年迭推代表晋京請願、當蒙鹽務署核准救濟、准於本年一月一日起、通銷鄂·湘·西·皖·蘇·五口岸、轉銷各省內地、規定產額爲司馬秤二百二十四萬担、銷數爲一百三十萬担、</p>
<p>各粗鹽商激烈反對</p>
<p>我國沿海一帶、多屬產監區域、惟所製成者、悉係粗鹽、當精鹽發明時、因係僅銷通商口岸、故於粗鹽銷路、尙無多大影響、自經去年鹽務署核准精鹽通銷內地後、粗鹽商營業、遂受嚴重打擊、銷內地後、粗鹽商營業、遂受嚴重打擊、乃紛起反對、迭向監務署呈請收回成命未果、現精鹽業各公司、以署命在前、咸積極設立各該省內地分銷處、以期銷足核定數額、救濟營業、遂復引起該粗鹽商之激烈反對、請求鹽署减少精鹽銷量、據聞刻已在積極進行中、</p>
<p>精鹽業擬請加銷額</p>
<p>記者昨訪精鹽業總會張樾君、據云、同業請求鹽務署核定產銷數額、本屬萬不得已之事、去年問晋京請願、荷蒙署方體念商艱、當卽核定銷額、惟彼時各口岸內地尙未可通銷、去年故僅銷足九十萬担、當經署方核准補銷、併入今年銷數、詎粗鹽商不諒、反而紛起反對署方核定之年銷數一百三十萬担、緣該總鉗數、以六大公司分配、每家銷數無幾、如此各走極端、同業前途尤難樂觀、今年上半年銷數、亦僅有七八十萬餘担、其餘之數、年底决可銷足、現同業爲求產銷平衡起見、決定再度向鹽務署請求增加銷額、以維營業云、</p>

<p>恒豐紗廠停工二月</p>
<p>本市滬東華勝路恒豐紗廠係紗業鉅子聶潞生氏所手創、雇有工人二三千、累年慘淡經營、煞費苦心、年來因市面不景氣、以致銷路瀕絕、更因紗貴棉賤影饗、致成本提高、每包需虧損二元至四元、照此現狀、殊屬無法維持、故决定於昨日起暫行停工兩月、所有工人則分別發給川資、暫時遺散、俟秋凉時節、再行復工紡紗、</p>
<p>本市存紗十萬餘包</p>
<p>又據紗業中人語大公社記者、本市存紗、最近因受外紗侵軋、影上、售價約在三四十元之間、價格雖低、但以巿上需要極微、銷數仍極有限、故紗業前途、殊屬黯淡云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （劉椀公）</p>
<p>人以爲醜者，我未必不以爲美，故情人眼裏出西施，好惡隨心理而轉變，古之所謂美者，今或以爲醜，今之所謂美者，數載之後，未必不以爲醜，故舉世競尙摩登，好惡又隨時代而移易，甲地之所謂美者，乙地或以爲醜，乙地以爲醜，甲地或以爲美，故歐西好高鼻，黑人好闊嘴，好惡亦因習俗而差別，準是以觀：世之所謂是非善惡，豈有一定之標準耶？</p>
<p>是非善惡，本無定評，大丈夫做事，祇須問合算不合算，原不必計世俗之好惡。譬如枉殺一人而安千萬人，則逕殺之可耳，竊一金鼎而終身之名譽喪失，君子不爲也。</p>
<h3>爲人在客</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>我們廠裏工友們中新加入一位花柳同志，他的梅毒成功史很够給大衆辨味的。</p>
<p>這個廿二歲的靑年在本廠服務已近二年。我們知道他初進廠時恰正新婚纔過蜜月，他的新夫人和他老母住在無錫鄉間老家裏，他每月總從上海匯寄十塊八塊錢回去給他母親養家的。廠裏雖有星期日或其他例假，他難得回家，實因來回的槃費很不上算，他是一個節儉而能識艱難的工人。</p>
<p>前年近年底，他回家一次，新年裏回廠，他面上便常帶着沉默不悅之色。據一個和他相好的工人說出來：他的老母和他的新妻日常不大和睦，這次他回家，入門不見其妻，原來伊已去住在娘屋有多月了。在這邊不接那邊不送的僵局之下，他只得在表面上順從母命，暗地裏去岳家進妻，勸解帶着安慰了沒一回兒就作別的。這個家庭間的糾紛眞够他煩惱，他的工作精神漸漸减低，聯帶的少賺工錢了！</p>
<p>直到去年秋間，他的和顏悅色纔恢復原狀，原來他日夜計劃着的，瞞住他母親把他夫人携來上海同居，居然實現了。接着不久他會有了第一個孩子。奈何生計的壓迫把那母子倆驅回鄉間娘屋去，他享了沒幾個月勉强的小家庭的幸福，仍歸孤獨度日。</p>
<p>能說他有了妻子不能同居的過分的寂寞是不該的麽？他自己難却朋友們陪同解悶的美意，在今春每晚上出去走走，不免就走進花月塲中了。若說管仲設備女兌二百，爲旅人們解决性的煩悶是正當政策，那麽，他本是一個曠夫，他偶然去一暢他的與衆相同的男女之欲，不能算是達了天理人情。</p>
<p>可是他現在，花柳病發作，失業回家去了！此後他本人的墮落，和他家庭前途黑暗的更難挽回也不用提了！恐怕這個靑年工友，便要在大衆認爲自作孽的眼光下埋沒了！</p>
<h3>欲進先退</h3>
<p>— （妙神）</p>
<p>女孩兒的脾氣，大都沒有男子直爽，她們喜歡故佈疑陣，欲進先退，使你捉摸不定，沒有耐心和細心的男子實不能和這類的女子週旋的。</p>
<p>譬如說你邀約某女友於明天去觀看一張新到的影片，某女友明明是很喜歡看影片的，同時這張影片伊也很對胃口，但伊總先推三阻四說不去，可是在言談之中，又暗暗來探問這影片好不好的口氣，於是你可料定伊一定答應去了。但是當伊臨行的時候，伊又諄諄可囑明天不要等伊，伊未必能去的；不過到了明天，你去訪伊的時候，發覺伊早已化裝好而預備赴約了。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回　簾幕隠啼痕難逃冷眼衣冠誇幸運曾到權門</p>
<p>因之背了兩手，慢慢的走向那天棚底下，作個向大桌上找報看的樣子。始而走來，逕直奔那桌子，云拿桌上的報，偶然將頭回過來時，不由他不吃一驚，便是賈多才那屋子的窗戶，已是兩扇洞開。靠窗戶，本來是有一張桌子，兩把靠背椅子的。這就看到月英背對了窗戶外邊，面朝着要，用手撑在桌子上托住了自己的頭。志前覺得他是一個名花有主的人了，朋友的資格，在昨晚已經喪失，現在稱呼他是不妥當的。於是拿了一張報，就坐在對面，向這邊看了來。報紙雖然是捧着擋往了面孔，可是眼光還由報頭射過，直看到窗于裏面去。許久的時問，月英居然回轉頭向窗子外面看了來。他眼光四散，好像是被一種什麽聲音驚醒過來，這還正在找着呢。志前仔細看他的臉色，似乎帶些蒼白。尤其兩隻眼眶，帶了一片紅彙。這紅暈並不旦什麽平常喜色，乾燥而不發潤，配上那呆呆的眼神，那是可以看出來，他內心却是怎麽樣子難過的。在志前這樣打量他的時候，他也就發現到外面坐的一位看報人，正在向他打量。原來也只認爲是個看報的，經過了兩分鐘的注意，那就看出來了是誰，立刻臉上由芥白變到紫色，猛可的扭轉頭去。（二六四）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>那一次的事情我也還記得，似乎是有什麽人給太后送來了幾簇粉紅色的鮮花，盛在一個很精緻的瓷瓶裏，要我給伊捧進去，獻給太后：我因爲正在上値的時候，便立卽親自捧了進去。太后見了，却並不十分歡喜，便隨口說道；</p>
<p>「將它安在那邊去吧。！」</p>
<p>說的時候，伊還伸出一指，指着屋隅的一張小桌子，意思就是要我去把這花瓶安在桌子上。我先是依着伊做了，但伊對於這一個命令原不曾用過什麽心思，所以我一走近桌子，便發現「花地不宜」了；因爲在那桌子的後面，鑲着一行晝板，它的顏色是淺黄的，一瓶粉紅色的花安在那裏，幾乎是混成一片了，比較疏忽一些的人，就決不會看見它。我便立卽向伊建議道：</p>
<p>「請瞧瞧看！老佛爺，我能不能把這一瓶花安在另外的地方去？」</p>
<p>伊聽了我這話，臉上頓時就透出了很詫異的神氣；這在當時我原不曾注意到，及至事後才想起，幷且還知道伊確然是應該這樣詫異的！</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？」伊反問着我。（三六四）</p>

<p>眞的，「生之哀歌」裏喬傑說的很對：畢業就是失業，文憑値幾個子一片！</p>
<p>跨出了學校的大門，曲健夫滿望能够找到一個比較好一點的職業的，依他那樣的人材，依他那樣的學問；但碰壁，碰壁，到處碰壁的結果，殘酷的現實的威力，早把他那座希望的冰山溶化了呢。</p>
<p>同時，在所謂偉大的科學的發展下，他的家又給列强者的戰鬥機轟炸了。</p>
<p>於是，他做了一個孤獨的流浪漢，窮是他的本色。飄到東，飄到西，一隻沒有頭的蒼蠅似的，一朶秋風中的飛花似的，沒自主的飄着，飄着，飄到了上海來啦——一個裝了三百萬瘋狂的市民的被譽爲東方巴黎的大都會。</p>
<p>日子給輾在別克跑車的輪子下，用一種世界上最快的速度滑了過去，到上海已經三個足日了呢，然而曲健夫在每天早兒睜開眼珠子的時候總還是——「今天的生活到什麽地方去想法呢？」那麽地愁慮着，夜光珠似的淚水，就一顆一顆的滾了下來啦，滾向嘴角邊，滾向胸襟上，滾向鼻管裏，滾向心坎中，是一種浸過監水的梅子的淡酸味。</p>
<p>誰明白他的底總呢，然而他確實是一個十足大少爺派的大學生呵。</p>
<p>用四百文的代價，每天爬到小旅館的擱舖的被窩裏，好像是夢幻似的，他那兒睡得着呢？躺着，想着，把往事翻覆地拿來溫習，似乎一切過去的繁華都是他的小說中的題材。從前是夢，現在是夢，便——「我一輩子也想不通頭啦」的提起難以處置的問題，想到了天亮。爬下床的時候，他的頭髮想白了，他的鬍鬚想長了一分。</p>
<p>終於給他候着一個機會了，用一種一秒鐘等於一天的焦急心情獲到了一個職業，大學三年最頸痛的科學機械並沒有使他白費心力，做一個汽車夫就正用得着啦。</p>
<p>主人洪姓，一九三四年的新別克跑車顯出了他的富有，公館在滬西愚園路。</p>
<p>三餐白飯是不會使他感到滿足的，社會的洪爐已把他鍜鍊得成了一個十分沉着的人，他的沉着的目光中泛起憤懣，惱怒，和仇視社曾的波浪。每天，他駕駛着主人上大華舞塲，上揚子飯店，上羣玉坊，會樂里，上申園逸園，回力球塲，上夜總會。每天，他替主人上藥房購買人參再造丸，龍虎固腎丸，百齡機，紅色補片，以及北京路慶餘堂裏的所有的名貴的補品。主人，一個上了年紀的紳士，可是精神却很健，遠看正像是一個二十來歲的小夥子啦。有錢的人是不會老的，這話兒很有根據。</p>
<p>這麼地，他忘了自己一切的過去似的幹着，幹着，幹着」</p>
<p>主人很愛他的，說他聰明伶俐，可是主人並不知道他的聰明伶俐是有來歷的；主人說，那是誇讚他的話：如果你幼時能够進學校讀上兩三年書，或者比現在更要聰明伶俐些！</p>
<p>讀書？讀書有嗎用呢？十五年的寒窗下的光陰，也無非是換得一個供人呼叱的汽車夫的位置而已！一想到這僩，曲健夫滿上有一雙灰色的眼，有一顆凄凉的心了。</p>
<p>同樣是一個人呵：他有一個明期的前額，他有一雙英武的眉毛，他有兩顆熱情的眸子，他有一隻挺直的鼻子，他有一口溫柔的嘴辱，他有一付魁偉的體格，和可是他是一個窮漢。</p>
<p>同樣是大學畢業生呵：他精通三四國語文，他懂得政治終濟，他明白社會科學，他會奏一手動人的小提琴，他會繪手感人的美術畫，</p>
<p>可是，他只做了一個汽車夫。</p>
<p>畢業就是失業，文憑値幾個子一片。可憐的生之哀歌呵。</p>

<p>出版界</p>
<h3>怎樣發展出版事業</h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>文化與出版有密切的關係，要發展文化就須發展出版事業。自然，站在出版方面看，不景氣極了，連資本很雄厚的書店，都必靠預約和對折來吸收現金，維持原狀還不得，那裏談得上發展？但站在文化立塲，却有力謀發展的必要。</p>
<p>爲甚麽呢？事實很顯然的是中國文化落後。只要你在文化界上一展望，確實是見不到中國。這是除開從未理解世界文化的復古派和誇大狂外，沒有人不知道的。</p>
<p>那末怎樣發展出版呢？從量方面說，我覺得是要多多出書。</p>
<p>書店是出版的中心，自然要多出書。對於它，我覺得任從那方面說，都當予以扶助。即不能，最低限度，也得實行這種政策：Laissez-faire,Laissez-passer.這樣，它沒有損失，也就能够完盡其出版的機能了。</p>
<p>書店之外，我覺得有很多的機關和團體等，都當負一部份出版的責任。</p>
<p>首先我們談學會吧。學會以研究或鼓勵研究爲事，最宜努力於出版活動。中國的學會很多，大的小的，普通的專門的，幾於應有盡有。然而不盡皆有出版事業。。有出版事業的亦多迹近衍敷，不過撑撑門面而已。否則旣集合了很多學者專家，爲甚麽不努力於出版事業？今後，我覺得每個學會，均當以出版來表現成績。至少應該有一個機關雜誌，兩部叢書——以一部翻譯世界名著，以一部容納會員創作。</p>
<p>其次有致力於出版之責任的是研究院和編譯館一類組織。它是國家拿錢辦川以吸收研究人員專事研究和編譯的。研究的報吿，應該發表成書。中國也有研究院，也有編譯館，而且它們也有出版物。但從旣有的成績看來，似乎還不够。以後應該積極振作，在出版方面來努力。</p>
<p>再次可以在出版上負些責任的，是學校。允其大學，所謂最高學府者，是應該同學會一樣，有機關雜誌和出版譯著之叢書的。其敎授皆學者專家，並以研究爲事，自當發表其研究所得。並且要這樣，纔足以證明其所教人不是販賣知識。中國的大學，目前大多有出版事業，只是不普遍，不積極，成績很少。因此喚起它們用出版來完盡其最高學府的責任，是必要的</p>
<p>學會，研究院，編譯館和大學，若均能努力於出版，不讓書店單獨負責，那來出版事業的發展當可迅速。這樣，文化也就進步了。中國便可從落後狀態中走出來，不辜負其爲文化古國。要復興文化麼？我想當從發展出版事業起</p>
<p>至於從質方面說，我覺得應該力求進步。這裏，我把我的意見分成幾點來講。</p>
<p>第一不應該多出中國古書。中國古書在了解中國過去的種種進化上，自須專家去讀。然而爲　有限。若像現在的競出競銷，一方面與復古暗潮相呼應，一方面助長復古暗潮的擴大。實在不是辦法。出版界應該站在推動文化的立塲纔是。</p>
<p>而且現在的古書不止是量多，並且一書數出。在外親上，雖然花樣翻新，我看在這幾年中，有價値的，只有古今圖書集成。其它大概是架床疊屋，巧立名目來賣錢而已。這幾乎純粹是一種商業的方法，少有文化意味。</p>
<p>第二，我覺得倒應該多出外國歐洲各國古書。因爲它在研究上有充分的必要。我們對於外國的政治經濟之制度，應該『迎頭趕上去』，以新爲佳。只有對於哲學科學之理論，則一面應該『迎頭趕上去』，一面又應該隨後跟着走。所謂迎頭趕上去，即學習他們最新的東西，以好向前創造。但在這時，回顧從前，吸取他們的傳統以深厚我們的泉源，却非讀外國古書不可。這不僅爲歷史，實在於現實的研究有必要。</p>
<p>然而這在中國出版界中，却是非常稀少。很多哲學史和科學史上的名著，竟沒有出版。我很盼望現在專門的學會，每一個能够把它那一門的名著編輯兩部；一部古典的，一部現實的。中國過去雖自有其哲學科學，然而從近代的歐洲發展說來，它却是沒有哲學科學的傳統。以介紹西洋文化爲事的人，應該注意這點。</p>
<p>第三，應該多出哲學科學一類書籍。無論從理論上說和技術上說，這都十分需要。它對於我們的思想，行動乃至整個生活的現代化上，關係很大。這是發達文化和改造社會之一起點或要事。</p>
<p>在普通的和高深的兩方面，我覺得均需要。沒有普通的竹學科學之大量的出版，不能把多數人提高到現在世界的一般文化水準上來。沒有高深的哲學科學之大量的出版，不能把少數人提高到現在世界的專門家理論程度上來，使我們走進創造之門。所以普通和高深的兩種哲學科學著作，都是出版界致力的所在。</p>
<p>第四，因爲這樣，現在是需要專門的書店來分工並進，包括萬有，這樣也出，那樣也出，要大書店纔可以。小書店特別應該選擇一種學術門類，作出版方針，以造成它的特色。或者依思想性質來分，也是對的。過去的小書店，從一九二八年以後好幾年間，一面競出新思想著作，一面在文學和社會科學方面專任一門，確於中國文化有很大的貢獻。如果中國的文化運動，從思想性質上分，以「五四」爲一期，「一九二八」以後爲一期，那末這期的出力者就完全是小書店。一般大書店，太保守，全然沒有絲毫貢獻。它們從使營業不曾遭受任何壓迫，然而這一點確是它們的恥辱！</p>
<p>現在不然。很多小書店在近兩三年都競出教科書各兒童讀物。這是不應該的。就從營業上說，也競爭不過大書店。結果，一無所長。出版特色喪失之日，即文北任務終止之時。願今日尙存在的小書店，恢復其過去專攻一門的性質。</p>
<p>從質方面來謀出版事業的發展，我一時所想到的就是這些。</p>
<p>出版關於文化很大，所以無論量方面或質方面，都當有一個打算。從事文化的人，應該注意及此。並還須對出版事業採取批評的態度，以資糾正。否則原因造壞了，結果就難保其好，未來文化便會黑暗起來。</p>
<h3>關於書的定價</h3>
<p>— 冷峯</p>
<p>買書眞是買不起，雖然竭力的省吃儉用，打算每月買上三五本書，可是，收入無多，終感極大的困靴。翻開報紙，看着新書舊籍的廣吿，心裏饞得很，但是看看價目，再摸摸自己的錢囊，只好歏一口氣了事。讀者們有此同感的，想來一定不乏其人吧！</p>
<p>確實的，書的定價是太貴了，一本薄薄的書，定價就得八毛或一元，買一本書的錢，足够窮人吃幾天的飯，咱們不是有錢朋友，看了這樣高貴的書價，除了歎氣之外，還有什麽辦法</p>
<p>因爲書價高貴，大家不的而同的責駡書店老闆，說其只知賺錢，不管人家書買得起買不起，彷彿人家的錢是偷來的搶來的或是拾來的，多多送給他是應該的，他的心眞是黑如煤炭！大家應該揭去他「提倡文化」的假面具！</p>
<p>明白一些出版界實情的朋友，他們並不這麼的火氣重，對於書店老闆，有了相當的原諒。他們說，一本書的成本二角五分，書店老闆所以要定價一元，理由是著作人要抽百分之十至二十的版稅，就去了一二角；代售的書店來批發，打一個七折，就得去三角，這樣，兩角五分的成本，已經變爲七角五分了。再加上代售書店欠賬的利息，自己在報紙上所登廣吿的費用算他去了一角五分，那他成本兩角五分，賣你一元錢，他也不過賺了你一角。再加上舊書之損失，一角錢還賺不到。說書店老闆心黑如煤炭，眞是怨枉煞人！像現在不景氣的年頭，生意做不多，外面的欠賬收不到，就是收到還得來一個折扣，書店老闆那裏還有錢好賺，弄得不好，連自己的「血本」都賠蝕了上去，所以有不少的書舖，吃不起賠累而關門倒閉。我們不但不應該駡書店老闆心黑如煤炭，我們應該可憐他，給他一點同情才對呢！</p>
<p>當然啦，這話是不能算錯的。然而，二角五分的成本，要賣一元錢，這未免終覺得太貴一些。我們一面對書店老闆要加以原諒，而同時又確實感到書價太貴一些，那自然；我們只有駡那一班書商了。他們向出版界批發，自己居中竟要賺三角錢，眞是黑心達於極點！我們要可憐書店老闆，又要書價便；那只有打倒這班書商，實行讀者興書店老闆直接發生關係了！過去，有些書局的「讀書會」，他們廣徵會員的宣言，就是要打倒居中取利的書商而實行出版界與讀者直接發生關係——就是希望續者的直接函購。自然，這當中也含着吸收現金的用意。</p>
<p>不過許多書店老闆，他把二角五分的成本要賣人家一元錢，終也不能可憐他和原滅他。因爲，他批發給人家打一個七折再欠賬，那賣給讀者，爲什麽現錢的還要實價？如果他賣給讀者也和批發一樣的價錢，在讀者當然已感激不盡，而讀者與書店之合作也立刻實現了，那居中的書商，自然不打就倒了。現在他們願意七折批發而不肯七折售給讀者，則其不希望讀者與之合作而希望居中的書商賺錢，那是很明明白白的了。那麽，我們爲什麽要與以可憐，與以原諒呢？書店老闆正把讀者當着獃子，讀者竟還不自知！</p>
<p>然而究竟因爲不景氣，迫着他們不得不七折八扣甚至半價的出售，現在不是有許多書店在大賣廉價書嗎？我希望他們能從此轉過頭來，採取薄利多賣主義。</p>

<h3>各書局印象記（續）</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>二十三　上海雜誌公司</p>
<p>上海雜誌公司是雜誌年中應時的聰明的創造。它的主人張君本是有經騐的書業界前輩，而且以前也是「動筆頭」的人。資格最老，而現已倒閉的光華書局與他有關，「社會科學年」（仿雜誌年名）中以社會科學專門書店相標榜的聯合書店，也是他所創辦，以前想做文藝書托辣斯的現代書局，他也曾主持其事。以這樣書業的前輩，來經營雜誌年中第一家雜誌公司，其成功自在意中。</p>
<p>我們認爲，雜誌的普遍是出版界衰落的一種畸形發展。因爲第：一，一般讀者購買力的衰落，第二，「專門智識需要」的常識化，這樣，便造成了雜誌的空前發達，——然這還有些誇張，事實上，中國今日雜誌的發達，僅是圖畫雜志及幽默小品的發達，與專門的學術毫無關係。</p>
<p>正和文藝書之後是社會科學書，其後是敎科書，其後是雜誌一樣，雜誌在今口已快近强弩之末了。第一，有了地位的雜誌不能水久維持其地位，新出的雜誌太「粗濫」，均可减少讀者的信仰，如論語，總算是頂紅的列物之一，而現在已慢慢地使讀者厭倦。而且，火部份人看雜誌，本是爲了一些趣味或刺激，這種成分是很難持久的，雜誌營業衰落，自在意中。第二，就雜誌本身來說，實不是最好的營業，因爲雜誌的定價廉，常不到成本，以致很少雜誌是不虧本的，上海雜誌公司木來自己出版好幾種雜誌，現在都改爲經傳了，就是爲了這個原因。但僅靠經售取佣，其利至薄，上海雜誌公司主持者雖幹練，恐也難勝過客觀的困雖。</p>
<p>現在，北他的雜誌公司接連興起，如中華，如羣衆，固是「上海」的打擊，然打擊最大的還是各書局雜誌經售部的日趨完備，如生活，如，開明，其號召力自必更甚於單純經售雜誌者。</p>
<p>因此，我們對於雜誌年的前途，實難樂觀。</p>

<h3>三年來無綫電機件進口比較</h3>
<p>— 無儔</p>
<p>本年一月至五月進口二百二十餘萬元，日貨激增</p>
<p>年來國內無綫電事業之發達，有突飛猛進之勢。際此百業衰敝之中，而該業獨具蓬勃之象，此種矛盾狀態，殊非一般人所能料及也。</p>
<p>考我國無綫電事業之發達，始於民十八年後。截至今日止，本埠之播昔電台在國際電訊局登記者。有交通部上海電台，亞美，東方，中西，華美，永生，富星，李樹德堂，明遠，佛音，眉壽堂，華泰，大東，西華美，東陸，沈氏，華僑，同樂，快樂，建華，周恊記，亞東，新新，敦篤堂，敦本堂，勞白生，福音，安定，友聯，元昌，亞聲，中華，大中華，鴻康，國泰，利達，利利，華興，孫氏，市音，華東，新聲，惠盡，電聲，孔氏，恒森，鶴鳴，蓬萊，其美，華光，楊氏，等共五十二家。內除大東，勞白生，其美，西華美，四家爲外人經營外。四十七家係華商經營。現巿府又規劃設一大規模之廣播電台於市中心區。本埠無綫電台可稱盛極一時矣。至本埠收音機之裝置計約達十萬餘具。以全市民三百餘萬計之，平均約三十人卽有一架收音機。以此足徵人民對此新興事業之需要也。</p>
<p>我國無綫電事業。旣如上述之盛。而自製之國貨機伴則極少見。外貨源源而來，自爲意料中事。據海關發表，本年本市一月至五月之五個月中，輸入之無綫電機件及零伴共值關金二百二十二萬六千零五十二關金元，合同幣有二百二十萬一千九百八十九銀元。較去年同期之進口數九十五萬二千九百九十八關金元，以關金計之，增加百分之二十三。倘將二十二年間同期之進口數六十萬六千三百五十九關金元與今年比之，則三年來之進口數突增一倍有餘。再考輸入國別二十二年以美國爲首。英德次之。荷蘭再次之。日本僅輸入七千餘關金元，佔末位。但在去年同期之輸入數，則日本以八萬餘關金，躍過英荷等國佔第三位，較二十二年激增十二倍。而在今年日本又超過德國，佔第二位。輸入數爲二十七萬八千餘元。三年來日貨之輸入，突增三十八倍餘。呈飛騰之象。以後恐且有不下於美數之勢。此種現象而呈現於國貨年中，豈非矛盾。吾願國人亟起，自謀製造，塡此漏巵。茲列三年進口國別比較表及五月份表於下。以供參攷。</p>

<h3>反射短波電訊的電離層</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>短波電訊自發射機發出後，卽分爲天波與地波二種地波沿地面而行，約在五十英里至一百英里間，因受吸收而迷漸消滅。天波則因在高空受反射作用，而能完成遠程通訊之使命。我人欲求可靠之遠程通訊，則於反射短波電訊之電離層（Ionosphere），不得不略加注意也。</p>
<p>遠在一九〇二年開納萊及海味散得二氏（KennellyandHeaviside），不約而同提出一種假定，謂在高空中反射無綫電波之物，乃爲一層能傳電之物質。此種假定，現已有事實上之證明。而該層能傳電之物質。據最近試騐結果，乃高空中氣體受電離作用所致。</p>
<p>圍繞地球之大氣，可照第一圖分爲若干層，其中之「電離層」卽無綫電波受反射作用之所在也。</p>
<p>研究電離層之簡便方法，爲測量自地面發出之無綫電波至電離層間往返所需之最短時間，因電波之速度爲已知，則發射機與電波受反射作用之間的距離，不難間接算出也。但電波受市離層之反射，其情形與光綫之受鏡子之反射不同，故得到之電離層之高度，亦有「實高」與「偽高」之分。偽高爲電波銳直反射之高度，其速度始終不變；實高則爲電波所能實際達到之最大高度，如第二圖。由圖可知偽高頗易計算，而實高則情形複雜，甚難計算。但事實上，如量出之偽高，若不因電波週率之更變，而有急劇之更變時，則偽高之數約與實高相等。</p>
<p>若將電波之週率在極短之時間內，作急劇之更變，而同時測算其偽高，則可得類如第三圖之曲綫。由圇可見在某某數點曲綫有銳急之折斷，此種折斷處，據試騐者之解釋，乃電波適在穿透某一反射層，而速率減小所致。</p>
<p>根據此種試騐結果，已知電離層中反射電波之反射層，至少有五；其高度並不一定，隨時可有改變，各層之名稱及次序亦詳第一圖Er及Rr二層之反射能力，隨太陽而改變，以略過中午時爲最大。其餘賭層，則變化無定。F2層在冬季於一刻鐘乃至半句鐘間，有時可有百份之五十之變化；此層之反射能力，約以冬季之中午，及夏季日落時爲最大。M層則有時變化無定，有時與Er及Rrll二層相像。</p>
<p>此外，地球之磁塲亦有相當影響。因在地磁塲中，電波受影響而分爲二，而各在不同之點受反射作用，故同一電波可有二個不同之偽高，如第四圖中之虛綫及實綫所代表者。</p>
<h3>經濟交流放揚聲器單管機</h3>
<p>— 曹潤生</p>
<p>這裏來介紹一隻收音機，是確能稱爲用件最經濟；效力最良好而無愧的。作者可以担保試騐者决不會失敗，假使他能很細心地做去。</p>
<p>我試騐此機時環境不甚良好，但是已有八九電台能一一在揚聲器中很淸晰饗亮地放出來，所以假使有良好環境的話，那末它的成績一定是非常驚人的！</p>
<p>綫路是來復式的一種，但是讀者別以爲它是來復式而不敢下手。你們儘管放大胆子去做好了！因爲這種來復式和普通的不同，它是製造易而效力好。作者有數位初學朋友曾試過此綫路而無一失敗者。但是話雖如此說，劣貨另件終究不可用，做出來的成績一定不妙！</p>

<h3>三屏三極眞空管</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>眞空管的進步可說是永無止境的，像最近德國的十二脚的眞空管，美國奇異公司的全金屬眞空管，我們還沒有相當的認識；一本英國無綫電雜誌（PracticalandAmateurWirelese）上又發表一種新式的眞空管，就是名聞世界的Mazda製造廠出品的「三屏三極眞空管」。</p>
<p>這種三屏三極眞空管，是一個管中包含三個二極部份，和一個三極部份；除去燈絲和陰極是公用之外，其餘完全獨立，所以事實上無異使用三枚二極管，和一枚三極管，因此應用極　。例如用做二極檢波，雜聲鎭壓，自動音量控制，和三極式成音週率放大，如附圖。又如用二枚小屏做全波檢波，第三小屏則做自動音量控制。或以一小屏連接一份安培表做爲調節指示器（Tuningindicator），以助調節，餘二小屏則做檢波及自動音量控制等等。</p>
<p>此式眞空管的燈絲爲四弗打一安培，最大屏壓爲二五〇弗打，屏極廻阻一萬三千歐姆，二極檢波與三極成音週率放大的總放大係數爲三十五。</p>
<h3>鋁的銲接法</h3>
<p>— 思廉</p>
<p>金屬物的種類極多，而在無綫電的應用中，常常可以見到的是黃銅，紫銅，鐵，鋁等幾種，而黄銅與紫銅價値較廉導電率又大，故在無綫電收發音機最爲廣用，鋁則通常用作底板或变壓器之蓋，或用作低週變壓器之壳。</p>
<p>收發音機中的接綫，必須銲固，否則牠的效力與成績將受到影響，這是研究無綫電者都知道的，但是銲接金屬物質，亦有難易，譬如二條紫銅絲相銲接，祗需加上點松香再將錫按上，就易鐸牢，若此二條紫銅絲已氣化而生銅綠，則先用沙紙擦淨就好。同時黄銅雖較紫銅難銲，但是加上一種松香油，也並不困難，最難的是銲接鋁質的物質，無論你加了松香或松香油，或淡硫酸，總不濟事。那末有什麼方法呢？</p>
<p>據美國雜誌上所載，銲接鋁質的媒介物，是一種合金，此種合金製成之後，只能專用於銲接鋁質物品，別無他用，其配合之成份如下：</p>
<p>先將錫熔解，至相當程度，再以木炭末及松香（或用蠟），投入，不久卽和勻，這樣可以免避錫表面因接觸空氣而氣化。再預備鎂一小塊，用鉗夾入熔錫裏，同時須不停攪拌，待鎂質完全熔解後，則此合金已成，可用以銲接銲質的物件。</p>
<h3>業餘隨筆（一續）</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>靜電騷擾在收音機內，至今尙是一件無法完全避免的困難問題「雖研究者窮日夜之工，埋頭苦幹，預備探究出完善的根本解决方法，但目前尙未能達到功德圓滿的地步。</p>
<p>關於靜電騷擾，普通所謂種種避免法，實際僅是消極的補救而已，談不上講澈底的改革，不過「有勝於無」，其收效雖微，事實上仍値得我們一試。</p>
<p>靜電騷擾中，有一種係天空靜電因放電而產生的，通常稱爲天電干擾，除却减短收音機的天綫外，加裝音調控制器，也能使之减弱。</p>
<p>人爲的靜電騷擾，如電動機，醫用電療器等，因其發射電波所致。普遍補救的方法，應用隔離式或地下式天綫，這乃就收音機電能輸入部分而言，此法雖佳，然因物質及裝置種種方面關係恐不切實用，</p>
<p>若在就近產生騷擾的機械電源輸入處，加以濾波裝置，則其收效頗大，蓋大部分由電源綫傳播之騷擾皆可因而免除，但所感困難的，卽預先能否得物主的允許耳！</p>
<p>圖二A所示，卽是此濾波器裝置的綫路，L是高週率阻流圈，可用十四號雙紗包綫在一吋半直徑管上繞一百圈，C是八兆與法拉特固定電容器，（須耐壓七百五十弗打）Ｆ是保險絲，爲防止電容器C短路時發生意外危險用，</p>
<p>交流收音機往往也懸用上述的濾波器，以减少由電源傳入的雜聲交流聲，但此法頗具危險性，不如採用問接隔離較爲安全，見圖二B，所示的虛綫卽是，（法以金屬片如鉛紙等）隔拉電源變壓器初級與次級之問並通地，而此隔離應絕對與初次級絕緣優良：若不用金屬片，可也可繞二十八號綫一層，一端不　，一端引至地綫代之，</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>仇敵與良友</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>最近因為國際參戰軍人的携手，法德妥協的空氣，又漸呈濃厚。前日德國退伍軍人代表團蒞臨巴黎，大受德國退伍軍人的歡迎。德國代表團主席奧柏林鐸伯，曾語哈瓦斯社記者謂：「吾人昨日尙爲仇敵，今日已是同志，明日將成良友。」這句話說得很坦白。</p>
<p>法德二國，本爲世仇，故曰：昨日尙爲仇敵。現時兩國退伍軍人，爲促進二國之接近，在巴黎作首次的晤面，故曰：今日已是同志。今後兩國妥恊。果能實現，就可化仇爲友，故曰：明日將成良友。</p>
<p>國際關係，純以利害得失爲轉移。兩國利害得失相衝突，則視若仇敵。反之？兩國利害得失相調和，則交如良友。這其間並沒有什麽道義存在。目前世界各國之今日聯甲以制乙，明日合丙以抗丁，其所採的策略，莫不取决於利害得失呢。</p>
<p>舉例來說。今的國際形勢，是極錯綜複雜的，使人看不出誰是誰之友，誰是誰之敵。法俄不是兩個不相容的國家嗎？不久以前，却已訂立法俄恊定，結爲同志。德意二國，邇來有一個時期，不是很意氣相投的聯絡着嗎？近日却又各走各的路，不相問聞。至若法國和德國，其仇恨之深，自大戰而後，簡直是有增無减。但現在也在進行妥協，儼然要捐棄舊怨，締成良友。這是什麽原故呢？卽利害得失的關係。</p>
<p>法德妥恊，實爲我們所歡迎。這事果能實現，雖不能卽視爲世界和平的保障。但至少歐局的糾紛，可以解决一半。然國際關係，旣純以利害得失爲轉移。故今日因利害得失而接近的法德，難保明日不再因利害得失而破裂呢。</p>
<h3>雨</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>幾天的霪雨下得金家埠頭一帶的溝渠里全滿了，各處高低田里的秧也都放了靑，河里的水已經漲了幾尺，那些低的田里實在有些危險了。</p>
<p>永生爹這幾天又在發愁了，他恐怕避免了旱災，却逃不過水災，况且水災比旱災還要可怕！</p>
<p>雖然現在是七月的天氣，然而氣候還像是個暮春的季節；晚間睡在床上還要將棉被裏裹緊，但是睡到後半夜依舊有些兒怕寒冷，這現象决不是盛夏所有的。所以在每一個人的心里都憧憬到這就是發大水的預兆。</p>
<p>今天永生爹在天纔朦朦亮，望見瓦罅隙里鑽進幾縷灰白色的曙光來的時侯，他就一骨碌從鋪上爬了起來，想着昨夜倒了一整夜的大雨，現在一定有好些低田給淹沒，他自己種的陸家浜里的幾畝田也恐怕保不住。—於是他走下床來，從一間黑沉沉的房里踱了出來，看見幾處地方的屋漏已把堂屋里漏得像個小河，那些泥士低陷的地方已經積了寸許水。</p>
<p>「這房子太老了，再隔幾年不修葺是不能再住人啦！」他自言自語的嘆息着，揀沒有積水的泥塊上一脚一脚的踏過來，走到天井沿上，抬頭望望天，天是仍舊扳着陰鬱的面孔，不見它露出一些　色。才出門，恰巧碰着前村的王申法，他也是要去看自家的田的。</p>
<p>「永生爹，你老也起早啊！田里怎樣了？你的田大約是不要緊的吧！」永生爹今天的確起得特別早，但是誰知道他昨晚一個整夜沒有合過眼呢！他聽着滴滴嗒嗒的鬧聲，彷彿比了機關槍的聲音還要害怕！王申法因爲難得看見永生爹起這樣淸早的，所以便那麼地問他。</p>
<p>「不要緊？際！我看照這樣下去，不消十天半個月，誰的田都要緊的。你現在也要去看秧嗎？」永生爹回答。</p>
<p>「看看有什麼用？淹的已經淹了，天還是要下雨的，你看這天馬上就會晴麼？」王申法指着天空說。</p>
<p>「眼前還不要緊，倒底楚底水小，所以雖然低的地方、，還不至於完全淹沒，不過要是再下幾天雨那就完了！」</p>
<p>「一年旱荒，一年大水，我們鄉下人人只有死路一條！」</p>
<p>「嘿！旱的時候滴水不下，一下雨就是一個無休止……」</p>
<p>」別說吧！我昨天聽三爺說：漢口和還有許多地方，街里也可以撑船啦！」</p>
<p>「好！不是早死餓死，必是淹死，我們早晚總逃不了一個死！」永生爹說到這里，情緒奮怒得連額上的幾條靑筋里都幾乎暴出了血來。</p>
<p>兩個人一邊談一邊走，把脚步却放得特别的沉重：這時大家全懷着一顆隊</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>鬱的心，向着浜渚的堤岸上走去，他們兩個人的臉都是同樣棚得緊緊的，在他們兩張面孔上，差不多找不出一塊活的地方。</p>
<p>走到一顆樟木樹下，他們分別了：各自踏上了自家的田垠，看見別人家的田里也在淹滿了水，只差得寸許，禾苗的全部就將被浸在水里了。微風吹過，田片里也會興作很美麗的波浪，遠望極像一片河面，靑的秧稍很有秩序的躬着背伏在黄濁的水面上，織成了一張有規律的網。</p>
<p>永生爹站在自己的田畔，望着一個月來，巴望下了雨，才經過半個多月的辛苦所種成的田出神，想到自己一塊田里，但是如今看起來又有些靠不住的危險了！</p>
<p>天空中又洒起雨來了，雖不很大，可是也很像樣的：</p>
<p>「啊！又要下雨了！！！」在金家埠頭的每一個人的心中，都同樣的漾起了這樣一聲恐怖的呼號！</p>
<h3>爛腿張三</h3>
<p>— 培元</p>
<p>住在我們貼隣的張三，自從那年六月裏上山伐薪不幸被火蛇鍊咬傷了腿之後，整整的爛了三年，死了。</p>
<p>自從他的腿潰爛後，村裏的人便喊他「爛腿張三」了，他聽了雖不願意，但也無法阻止人不這樣喊他，可是當孩子們走過他面前，要是不喊他張大叔而也喊他「爛腿張三」的時候，他不聽見便罷，聽了被卽刻改變他的常態，怒氣沖冲的：「媽的皮，狗娘娘養的，老子爛腿和你們小畜生有什麼相干……沒有敎訓的小畜生，小王八蛋的……」什麼不入耳的話便會從他的嘴裏吐出來，但孩子們欺侮他不能追趕他們，接着還是駡他：「爛死了你這臭張三，明天就要爛死」，這才跑開他去。張三這有氣憤憤的望着他們，有時氣憤極了，便將兩根撑棍對他們擲去，但不僅不能擲中他們，撑棍往往反被他們拿去，結果：張三只有忍氣吞聲向他們說些好話，要求把撑棍還給他。</p>
<p>每天：張三總得受這般玩皮的孩子們的欺侮。</p>
<p>張三腿被蛇咬傷的那天，與他妻子結婚剛剛滿一個月，他的妻很年輕，很美麗，很風流，張三腿沒被蛇咬傷就不願跟他在一起，腿咬傷了之後，他的妻　借故他的腿　便與他分床了，而暗地裏去姘了張三的叔父張太爺，張三雖明知道妻子的行爲，但是自己腿傷了後，便不能伐薪到城巿裏去換錢來養活自己和妻子，一家的生活費用全賴自己叔父供給，所以他從不敢揭破他們的秘密。</p>
<p>張三爛腿爛了第三年的時候，妻子養了一個小孩，面貌與張太爺一色一樣，於是：這風聲一傳七，十傳百，——沒兩天，全村的人都知道了張三妻子養了一個活像張太爺的小孩子。</p>
<p>「爛腿張三，你的屬氣眞好，沒有費一點兒的氣力便有了孩子」</p>
<p>「爛腿張三，你的小孩面貌眞像你的叔太爺」。</p>
<p>每天，張三就會聽得這些諷笑他的話，他聽了，只是低着頭，不嚮一聲，臉紅紅的。</p>
<p>村子裏的玩皮孩子們現在也不喊張三是爛腿張三了，他們也改變了稱呼，喊他「爛腿烏龜」了，張三並不像從前那樣火氣很大的回罵他們，也是低着頭，不嚮一聲，臉紅紅的。</p>
<p>孩子滿月了，張太爺事前發了很多帖子請客，帖子上竟公然寫着是自己添的孩子，村裏人都懼張太爺有錢有勢，誰敢說一句話，到滿月這天，來賀張太爺喜的佔全村十分之九的人數，但，奇怪的是這天張三忽沒有一個人能够看見他，一般人料，也許張三含羞藏躱起來了。</p>
<p>第二天，兩個人從張三家裏抬出一口很薄的棺材，</p>
<p>——原來張三就在孩子滿月那天在自己睡的一間房子裏懸樑自縊而死了。</p>
<h3>白日夢語</h3>
<p>— 夏蔭</p>
<p>（一）我明白自己</p>
<p>誰能不爲自己的生涯嗟息？當世紀的黑手抓去了黄金的童年，與幸福的夢幻的時候，遺剩下來的日子，這一片灰色的朦朧，萎黄病患者似地，漸漸的腐蝕了生命中的一切雄圖壯志。對於這可怕的消沉，誰能不徐徐感到一股可怕的戰慄，牢牢戮在心上呢。</p>
<p>唉，對於眼前的生涯，我只能發一聲無可奈何的嗟息了。</p>
<p>我不信人生是一個謎樣的來西。對於自己，我都看得很明白；對於人，也很淸楚。日子雖然是一長串的來了又去；去了又來，永沒有行到盡頭的時侯；一個人的生命可是在跟隨日子的過去，向着衰老滅亡之途爬去的。彪炳　寶的功業，又算得什麽？世紀的黑手是隨時隨地都能把你抓去的哪。</p>
<p>自家有時也很驚異，何以年靑靑的人會走入這消極的僻地地——自暴自棄的慢性自殺哪。但是，我也會隨卽明白過來。以其說這是對人生的消極，就不如說是對眼前渺漠灰色的生涯，情操上所激發出來的反動爲確當呀。不是麼？在自家的生命裏，那一處地方會有衰老與暮氣的徵象的鑲鏤呢。</p>
<p>———一片出土的嫩芽，若果沒有陽光與雨露，給與溫熱與滋潤，它的生命是只有永遠嫩白，永遠脆弱的。</p>
<p>這句話，我澈底明白，澈底了解。我是明白自己的。</p>
<p>（二）只能對生涯嘆息</p>
<p>我曾經對着赤紅的朝日發過一個誓願，我說我要小心珍貴自己的年靑的生命，候它好好開出一朶鮮艷的花朶，在壯麗的陽光之下，使自己永遠浴在歡笑中打發日子。</p>
<p>自從許下這個誓願，心頭似乎就開朗了些，像一隻被擲於黑夜的海上的孤舟，突然在絕望里望見了彼岸的燈塔。我忍抑着一切幽憤，像一隻駱駝，紮穩自己的脚步，推着生命的輪軸，捱荷一切生涯的磨難，不嘆息，不呻吟，跋涉於風沙捲地的戈壁之中。是的，在這一切磨難下，我相信自家的忍耐，在期待自己年靑的生命，好好開出一朶鮮艷的花，在壯麗的陽光之下。</p>
<p>在那時候，我忘記了一切艱難？看不到人世一切的醜惡；不畏難於當前的風暴寒冷：酷日在雨。我只潛心於自己的忍耐，掙扎。於是，人們也不斷把一切讚獎的美詞，向我投來，善意的惡意的，我都一概含首接受。他們都說一個人的幸福是用汗血，忍耐，服從堆積起來的。</p>
<p>然而，一年一年過去了，時間增長，我的智慧；懷疑的覺　，使我漸漸把沉着的頭拍了起來，於是，我復看淸了周遭的一切，我明自了我過去一切忍耐的努力都是徒然浪費，撲向空虛去了；我看不到自己的生命開出的花朶；我開始對生涯嘆息起來；我原來用自己的誓願騙了自己！</p>
<p>雖然，我還年靑，有的是磅礴天地的熱情。只是現實的幻滅，使這受了創傷的心，已滲滲的流了不少鮮血了哪。</p>
<p>生命難道永遠開不出鮮艷的花朶麼？唉，而今我只能對生涯嘆息呀。</p>
<h3>生理解剖課</h3>
<p>— 陳田舍</p>
<p>星期一第一課是上Dr．吳的生理解剖，在醫校裏，這課程頗引起同學們的注意，而感到趣味化。在講胃黏液之作用的時候，能知道了汽水的製造法，這次講到血壓，我們又得到試驗血壓的機會了。</p>
<p>夏月的天氣，課堂裏散着八十五度的氣溫，顯現着浮躁的情况，拍紙簿，講義夾，手帕……都權充了臨時的扇子。可是課堂裏並沒有少一個人，要是上別的課，那還客氣嗎？準有三分之一的人溜到惠而康飲冰室去了，尤其是九位女生，在夏月，女生往往把冰洪淋當飯吃，眞疑心她們熱的感受力比較男子強？</p>
<p>Dr．吳今天穿了一套白帆布西裝，白襯衫，白領帶，襯出一個白晳的理智的額角，帶着溫和趣味的微笑，有次序地從他的皮包裏取出檢騐血壓的儀器，講義，掛圖說明，照例，胸脯一挺，扔了笑容。</p>
<p>「我們對於人體血液的流動及作用已經很明白的分述過了，血流和河流是同一個原理，發源處流得很急，漸漸下去，就减了速度，面到支流——毛細血管，更流得遲緩如一灣泉水……」</p>
<p>他邊說就在黑板上書出動脈系統圖，又不時抹着額上的汗，鼻子一喚一喚，他怕粉筆灰竄進鼻　的樣子。</p>
<p>「吳先生，粉筆灰與人體可有什麽妨碍？上次你說棉紗屑是有害肺部的。」第五排女生陶羨冰故意這樣鬧玩笑似的發問。全課堂的臉都被這問題挑露出一絲刻薄的笑容，四十三對眼睛釘着Dr吳的帶着三分可憐的面部。氣候在講台的週圍似乎凉陰了許多，他仍保持着原來的態度說：</p>
<p>「怎麽不有妨碍呢！無論與眼睛，腦門，肺部，礦質粉啊，可是……</p>
<p>下面沒有說得出來的——</p>
<p>「這是我的生活哪！」橫撓在喉嚨口，他凑到痰孟口吐了一口痰，不是痰，是酸辛的生活的液汁：涎沫。要是在一個月之前，他又將疑心吐血了，他嘗經患過吐血症，血壓超一六〇耗以外，自已施行了肺癆檢騐，在臂上種了肺癆反應的苗……是多麼衰弱的人呵。他在陌生人之前，不敢承認自己是個生理敎授的。在思慮沉鬱的一剎中……</p>
<p>「快給我們檢騐血壓吧……又想敷衍一課過去了嗎……」</p>
<p>雖是輕輕的幾句，却每個音韻都像針尖般，引刺着他心室的每一個瓣膜。他把粉筆放進馬口鐵盆子，移轉了慚愧的目光看着講台下而每一個健康的學生，每一張血色紅潤的臉，笑一笑說：</p>
<p>「我看諸位的血壓大的都沒有病態，要騐的，可以跑上來，嘿嘿……」</p>
<p>於是一支一支粗而又堅强的絡臂在他二百五十度蔡司朋克鏡片下流過去了，記錄冊上：李健rr5－65，王玲淸ro8－6。，胡中宇120－70……耗OK。</p>
<p>下課鐘響後，他才拍拍肩上的的的粉筆灰，拖着疲倦的身子蹩出現</p>

<p>情的一字最難云。說起來意義頗高深。天地無情不成化。日月無情不放明。物類無情難長養。人類無情怎生存。可惜那，世俗論情多不恰。只知道，兩性戀愛使爲情。所以，用情不廣大。偏嗔偏愛逞私心。要曉得，天地從無私覆載。日月從無私照臨。情湖虛空無缺漏。看來反覺似無情。所以說，慈悲無情情愈大。太上忘情情更深。古時有個唐堯帝。德大如天人莫名。那凡夫。總不能。只好就情中論厚薄。還要看情假與情眞。厚的是，春水一潭深不測。薄的是，秋雲一片素羅輕。眞的是，蹈火赴湯全不避。假的是，盟山誓海也虛文。還有那，情網投身眞可惜。情塲失意最傷心。拆開情侶成畏恨。發露情書出醜名。這種用情多不正。正的是，反而不關心。甚至於，骨肉相殘情何在。生身父母也傷情。雖不比，痛癢不知無情物。却多是，忘恩負義薄情人。邊說什麽，大同世界慶昇平。</p>

<h3>Yellow River Breach Reaches Yuncheng, Threatens to Flow Directly into Northern Jiangsu; Jiangsu Construction Department Orders Strict Precautions,徵集民夫趕修故堤; Han Fu-qu Repeatedly Telegraphs Requesting Funds; Luokou Water Level Exceeds Last Year's Highest Record</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The southern embankment of the Yellow River in Juancheng, Shandong Province, has breached, and the water has reached Juncheng, posing a threat to northern Jiangsu. Local residents have been mobilized to prepare for emergency repairs and expedite the restoration of the old Yellow River embankment to prevent flooding. It is reported that if the water flows directly into the Weishan Lake, both Pei and Feng counties will be in a critical situation. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River breach in Yunxian County, Shandong Province, has caused water to spread southeast of Juancheng. The Jiangsu Construction Department has telegraphed the Xunqu Special Commissioner's Office to take strict precautions. Special Commissioner Shao Hanyuan has issued twelve urgent orders to counties along the old Yellow River course, including Tongshan, Fengxian, Peixian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, and Picheng, to mobilize residents and implement appropriate preventive measures. The Tongshan County government has instructed each district along the river to gather five hundred residents to prepare for emergency repairs when the water arrives. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the Yellow River water continues to rise significantly. The water level at Luokou has reached 30.7 meters, exceeding last year's highest water level by 1.5 centimeters. The breached water accounts for 70% of the main current, and the Jiangsu dam has been completely submerged. The water has reached twenty li west of Yuncheng, then turned south, and then westward towards Heze, indicating a strong trend to follow the old course into Jiangsu. Han Fu-qu has decided to allocate one million yuan for disaster relief and plans to send people with 20,000 yuan as emergency relief funds on the 13th. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) It has been confirmed that there are two breaches in the Yellow River: (1) the Lizhengcun village embankment, where the water flows north and east from the breach, flooding Juancheng and Shouzhang; (2) the Linpuji main embankment, where the water flows south and east from the breach, dividing into two streams: one northward towards Yuncheng, and the other southward towards the border of Yuncheng and Juye. If these two streams flow eastward along the Zhu and Zhao Wang rivers into Nan Chang Lake or Nan Wang Lake, they will inevitably divert the canal into the Huai River. If they turn westward, they will flood Heze and flow south, following the old Yellow River course through Fengxian, Peixian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, and Xuzhou into the sea. The Jiangsu dam was built fifteen years ago with funds to prevent this, but now the dam base has been completely submerged, which is very dangerous. In addition, various works and embankments in the upper, middle, and lower reaches are either overflowing or collapsing, riddled with holes, and emergency repairs are underway. Today, Han Fu-qu telegraphed Lin Zai, Chiang Kai-shek, and Song Ziwen, as well as Li Yishe, requesting prompt allocation of funds to close the breaches, to prevent the breach from widening further, causing the entire river to flow downwards, diverting the canal into the Huai River, and leading to a change in the river's course. The provincial treasury is insufficient due to the reduction of excessive taxes and miscellaneous expenses. Even exhausting all available funds would not be enough. Engineering personnel can be responsible for recruitment. Today, the water in the middle and lower reaches continues to rise, with the Luokou water level at 30.73 meters. Han has telegraphed the central government, requesting to follow the Zhejiang-Jiangxi flood relief measures, deducting 2% of civil servants' salaries and not remitting income tax to the central government for emergency relief. Tonight there is heavy rain, and reports from the upper reaches indicate that flood victims are sleeping on the embankments, their cries echoing for dozens of miles. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han telegraphed Lin, Jiang, and Song, reporting on the Yellow River breach, stating that the people in the disaster areas of more than ten counties in western Shandong have suffered from drought this spring, resulting in a poor wheat harvest. Just as they were celebrating the recent rains, which offered hope for an autumn harvest, the late rice crop could not be planted due to the heavy rain and waterlogging. "Alas, how can our disaster victims survive? I am pacing around the room, my heart burning. I am responsible for comforting the people and must think of remedies urgently. However, the provincial treasury is depleted, like a drop in the bucket, and I deeply fear it will be ineffective. I respectfully request that Your Excellency consider the plight of the disaster victims, who are in imminent danger, and promptly allocate funds for emergency relief to save lives. The disaster this time is caused by the fierce flow of the Yellow River, but the relevant river management agencies cannot shirk their responsibility for inadequate protection. Fu-qu has failed to supervise and inspect, and he is also responsible. In addition to severely investigating and punishing the relevant chief and sub-section chiefs, I request that Fu-qu and Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, be severely punished to serve as a warning and maintain discipline. I am extremely fearful and await orders. " He also telegraphed the Ministry of Interior and the Relief Commission, urging them to quickly release emergency relief. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Government Cables the Capital with Detailed Disaster Report; Sixth District Commissioner Shi Yuling Fasts for Three Days</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The provincial government urgently telegraphed the central government on the 11th, providing a detailed disaster report. The most severely affected areas are Yichang and other counties, with over 100,000 disaster victims. After the collapse of the Shishou and Fuxing embankments, dozens of embankments on both main and tributary streams were breached. The government requested a large sum for disaster relief. Furthermore, Tianmen City was completely flooded, and the Sixth District Commissioner, Shi Yuling, has fasted for three days. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tongxi Transportation Restored; Still Water Inside Yanshi City</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, passed through Xuzhou from Zhengzhou on the 12th on his way to Beijing. According to him, the water level in the western section has receded, and transportation east of Tongguan has not been interrupted. Transportation west of Tongguan has also been restored. A fast train from Xuzhou to the west today can reach Xi'an. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Railway news: Transportation west of Tongguan has been restored, and the Xuzhou station has been ordered to sell passenger tickets to Xi'an. However, the Baqiao Bridge has not been repaired yet, and passengers must take a boat across the water when the train reaches Baqiao Bridge before transferring to a train to Xijing (Xi'an). Direct access should be available within a week. There is still water inside Yanshi City, and the county magistrate has returned to the city to handle the aftermath. The whereabouts of the county magistrate's wife are still unknown. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Railway news: After the Pinghan Railway traffic was disrupted, the railway authorities are instructing workers to repair the line in sections. Water is being pumped out, and the southbound express train on the 12th has been extended to Xuchang. Longhai Railway passenger tickets are also being sold as far as Weinan. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hebei River Bureau Director Sends Urgent Appeal; Shang Zhen Orders Allocation of Large Sums</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Qi Shou'an, Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the provincial government, stating that the Yellow River water level continues to rise unabated, and the Laoda Embankment area is in critical danger. Residents are being supervised to carry out emergency repairs day and night. He requested prompt allocation of large sums to purchase materials for emergency repairs. Shang Zhen has instructed Lu Xian, Director of the Construction Department, that in addition to transferring 30,000 yuan from the flood control funds for emergency construction expenses, additional large sums should be raised and remitted to the construction site for use. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ping Sui Railway Bureau Meeting; Discussing Prevention of Floods</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Chang returned to Beiping from Shanghai this morning. According to him, he met with Mr. Huang during his trip south, but had no special mission.

The railway authorities are now taking measures to prevent losses. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Chang convened a bureau affairs meeting this afternoon to discuss flood prevention matters. Key officials from various departments attended. In the afternoon, Shen met with Wang Kemin, Bao Wenwei, and Yuan Liang to convey the central government's intentions. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Qin Fen Telegraphs Reporting Conditions of Embankments Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jingwei Secretary-General Qin Fen telegraphed Jingwei from his travels, reporting on the conditions of embankments along the Yangtze River. The Mahua Embankment in Anhui Province, below Hankou on both sides of the Yangtze River, has breached. He has instructed Anhui Construction Department Director Liu to be responsible for repairing and fortifying it, and has allocated 30,000 yuan for assistance. The Tongren and Chugong embankments in Jiangxi Province are in danger, and 4,000 yuan has been allocated for emergency repairs. The Director of the Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau is responsible for protection. No other dangerous situations have occurred. In addition, many of the inner field weirs in Poyang have collapsed. He has telegraphed Construction Department Director Gong to pay close attention to emergency repairs. The Zhanggong Embankment in Hankou is being urgently repaired day and night by the local authorities, soldiers, and civilians, and it is expected that there will be no danger. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Anqing) The water level in Anqing at noon on the 12th was 12.36 meters, which is 0.83 meters lower than the flood level in 1931. It appears that there is a rising trend. Miao Peicheng, the Anhui-Jiangxi Inspector, plans to travel upstream to inspect the dikes within the next few days. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangrong Supervises Flood Prevention in Three Provinces</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) Kong Xiangrong has been dispatched by the Economic Committee to supervise flood prevention along the Yellow River in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Kong established an office in Bian (Kaifeng) on the 12th. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Li Yishe, Kong Xiangrong, and Zhang Hanying returned to Bian from Linpuji on the 12th. The telephone lines damaged by the floods in Henan Province, except for the section between Xuchang and Yancheng, where construction cannot be carried out due to high water levels, have all been repaired. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Han River Rose Sharply Again Yesterday; The Western Embankment of the Japanese Concession Collapsed; The Water Depth in Special District One Reached More Than One Foot; Zhang Xueliang Took the Opportunity to Inspect the Embankments</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Han River rose sharply again on the 12th. The Qiaokou area has become a marsh, and the Zhanggong Embankment is again on the verge of danger. Residents are extremely worried. According to the Jianghan Customs water level report, the water level in Hankou at 4:00 PM on the 12th was 50.6 inches, an increase of 1.3 feet compared to the 11th. Yichang's level was 302 inches, a decrease of 2.3 feet compared to the 11th. Changsha was at 27 feet 5 inches, a decrease of 4 inches compared to the 11th. Considering that the upstream water level is gradually receding, if the weather continues to be clear, Hankou may be able to safely overcome the crisis. (12th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The weather has recently cleared up, and the water level has gradually stabilized. Unexpectedly, it rose sharply again on the night of the 11th, reaching 50 feet 1 inch. If the emergency repairs on each dike are slightly neglected, danger may be imminent. In order to understand the water situation and emergency repair efforts, Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by Qian Dajun, took a plane from Nanhuy Airport on the 12th to inspect the area around Wuhan for a week. He paid particular attention to the Zhanggong and Wuhui Embankments. From the plane, he observed the emergency work of the repair personnel on each embankment. After about an hour, he landed at Nanhuy Airport and went to the Zhanggong Embankment, where he met Wu, the division commander in Hankou, and Chen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, who were in charge of the dike protection work in Beijing, and gave them further instructions before returning to the headquarters. (12th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) From 11:00 PM last night, the river water suddenly rose sharply, exceeding 50 meters by 3:00 AM this morning. At 5:00 AM, the dikes in various concessions were leaking water, and the Zhanggong Embankment surrounding Hankou was quite dangerous. Wu Guozhen, the mayor of Hankou, visited the consuls of various countries to request cooperation in flood prevention work. As a result, foreign residents decided to jointly implement flood prevention measures. At 7:00 AM this morning, a section of the dike in the German concession collapsed. Sandbags are being used to reinforce the dike. The Da'an Spinning Factory was flooded, and business will be difficult to open today. The entire Hanyang area was flooded, and residents climbed onto rooftops to take refuge. The situation is dire. The Japanese Consul General, Miura, invited the police chief and the directors of the civil defense corps at 3:00 AM to discuss countermeasures and issued a warning to all Japanese residents. (12th Dispatch from the Japanese United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Fortunately, the rising water in Danshuichi in the Japanese concession of this city was gradually contained by 2:00 PM, preventing its collapse. However, the water continues to rise in various places and remains in a dangerous state. Muddy currents are everywhere in the city, especially in Special District One, where the water depth reaches more than one foot. The area surrounding the Yangtze River dikes and the Pinghan Railway is crowded with thousands of refugees from nearby villages. The situation is very tragic. (12th Dispatch from the Japanese United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The western embankment of the Japanese concession collapsed, and the surrounding area has turned into a marsh. The river level was 50.8 feet at noon today. (12th Dispatch from the Japanese United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) (Sent at 11:45 AM) The water level is rising hourly and has now reached 50 feet 7 inches. It is expected to reach 50 feet by noon. According to the river patrol officers, the rise in water in Hankou is due to the large rise in the Han River, coupled with the rise in water in Yichang on July 5th. All residents of the city are making preparations. Machinery and various items on the lower floors have been moved to the upper floors. Properties in low-lying areas are flooded and cannot be moved. The Public Security Bureau prohibits residents from walking on the Jiangbin Road in the former German concession because the road is flooded and has loosened. Zhang Qun returned here by plane from Beijing yesterday, then inspected the dikes, and then convened a meeting to discuss emergency relief methods. According to reports from the Chinese side, Yichang was swept away by the flood. Residents who managed to escape are now lacking food. However, foreigners believe that this statement is exaggerated. It is also rumored that 500 Chinese soldiers drowned in a village near Yichang, and their bodies are now floating downstream. (12th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Hydrological Stations Being Hastily Set Up Along the Banks of Rivers in North China</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) As the flood season for various rivers has arrived, the North China Water Conservancy Commission is setting up hydrological stations along the banks of various rivers to prevent danger. Engineers and surveyors have departed to the work sites and are required to reach the sites by the 15th. The locations for setting up stations include Lugou Bridge in Wanping County to prevent flooding on the Yongding River; Shuangying Town in Yongqing County to prevent flooding on the Yongding River; within the county town of Tongxian County to prevent flooding on the North Canal and Wenyu River; Zhangjiaqiao in Xianxian County to prevent flooding on the Hutuo and Ziya Rivers; a station in Dingxian County to prevent flooding on the Xin Tang River and the Lao Tang River; Machang in Qingxian County to prevent flooding on the South Canal; and a station in Xinle County to prevent flooding on the Sha River. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Prepares to Inspect the Flood Situation Along the Yangtze River; Officials to Be Sent to Survey Yellow River Flooding</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After arriving in Beijing the day before yesterday, Xu Shiying visited various authorities to discuss relief funds. The results were satisfactory. He returned to Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 12th to prepare for his departure for inspection. Before leaving, he told reporters that the rising water levels in various places recently are truly alarming. The committee has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, reporting that the disaster situation is severe, similar to the situation in 1931. Under the supervision and instruction of all parties, the disaster has not been expanded. It is currently reported that 23 counties in Hunan, 12 counties in Hubei, 34 counties in Jiangxi, several counties in Anhui, and 17 counties in Zhejiang are affected by the disaster. I will go to Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan on the 15th for inspection and discuss relief with the authorities of each province. I will also urge the establishment of a disaster relief reserve fund as soon as possible, so that the central and local governments are prepared for any eventuality. The Yellow River water is rising sharply, and several counties have suffered. A disaster situation has been telegraphed to Beijing. Due to lack of time, I cannot visit all the areas. I will send officials to go. (12th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Government Held Disaster Relief Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) As floods have spread across half of the province, the Jiangxi Provincial Government held a disaster relief meeting on the 12th and decided to allocate 2,000 yuan for emergency relief.

<h3>The Huai River Conservancy Office Takes Precautions Along the Grand Canal</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Due to the Yellow River floods in Shandong and Henan, the Huai River Conservancy Office and the Canal Works Bureau are taking precautions along the Grand Canal to prevent the floodwaters from affecting northern Jiangsu. They have telegraphed the four counties of Pi, Su, Huai, and Si, instructing them to take full precautions. The Grand Canal is very low, and ships are congested between Mapengwan and Jieshou, and navigation has not yet resumed. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhou Lisheng Braved the Rain to Inspect the Yongding River Works</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Lisheng braved the rain on the 12th to inspect the important sections of the Yongding River, both upstream and downstream, for more than a hundred li, all on foot. According to him, the river dikes are still solid, and the water flow is slow. If there is no heavy rain upstream, there should be no problems in the short term. He has instructed the River Affairs Bureau to strengthen precautions. He will go to Changyuan, Puyang, and other places on the 13th to inspect the Yellow River dikes and return to Beiping in a week. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Lisheng went to Bao this morning to meet with merchants, then turned to southern Hebei to inspect the Yellow River situation. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dikes Along the Yangtze River Near Xiaguan Are Being Raised; Water Level Rose Slightly Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the records of the Public Works Bureau, the highest water level at Xiaguan on the 12th was 6.860 meters at 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, a rise of 0.03 meters. At 5:00 PM, it rose to 6.768 meters. The water level of the Qinhuai River in the city is about one foot lower than the water level of the Yangtze River. The dikes along the Yangtze River near Xiaguan have been heightened by one foot, so that there will be no danger even if the water level rises slightly in the future. The low-lying areas of Pukou are flooded. The Xiaguan Flood Control Committee and the flood control personnel of the Public Works Bureau are jointly handling emergency repairs and construction of dikes and weirs to effectively prevent flooding. The Shangxinhe, Hei Bridge, and Xiaohekou areas have been blocked by militiamen. The original dikes in the villages, totaling 2,600 meters, are now being completed in the first phase of flood prevention work by the flood control team in conjunction with the shantytown management office. Culverts have been completely blocked, and dikes have been thickened and heightened with burlap bags and soil to provide flood protection. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Revised Publication Law, Also Passes Bills for Issuing Sichuan Financial Treasury Bonds and Guangdong Construction Public Bonds</h3>

The agenda included: (1) Revising the Organization Law of the General Staff Headquarters; (2) Revising the Organization Law of the Army University. Resolutions: The above two cases were passed with revisions based on the Military Affairs Committee's review. (3) Convention on Improving Treatment of Sick and Wounded Personnel in the Field; (4) Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War during Wartime.

Article 37, regarding the qualifications of senior and investigating judges, adds a fifth clause: those who have served as legislators for more than three years.

Resolution: The above two cases were passed with the review of the Legal System Committee.

(16) Joining the International Load Line Convention. Resolution: Passed with the review of the Foreign Affairs, Commerce, and Law Committees, stating that China could join the convention because over thirty countries worldwide had already joined.

Resolution: Passed with the review of the Legal System Committee. In addition, four military, financial, and confidential cases were passed. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The main points of the revised Publication Law are as follows: (1) Newspapers and magazines must be registered and approved by the local competent authorities before they can be published. The local competent authorities should decide on this application within two weeks of receiving it. (2) The social bureaus of county and city governments and municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan are the local competent authorities for publication administration. (3) Those publishing advertisements, announcements, photos, and illustrations in publications are responsible for the restrictions stipulated in this law. (4) If the local competent authorities discover that a publication violates regulations, they may temporarily confiscate it. (5) The debate on prohibited public litigation cases should not be published, and no criticism should be made until after the judgment of the litigation case. (6) Matters concerning personal or family privacy shall not be published. (7) Those who violate the provisions of Articles 19 and 20 shall be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for not more than one year. (8) Publishers of books and other publications may voluntarily submit manuscripts for review before publication. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The revised Publication Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 12th. During the initial deliberation, Cheng Zhongxing, Lu Zhiyi, and others advocated that the revised draft be announced and opinions solicited, following the precedents of the Criminal Law and Bankruptcy Law, to avoid difficulties in future implementation and damage to the credibility of the legislature. Huang Youchang, Fu Bingchang, Chen Chang, Liu Guanxun, and others advocated that the case be re-submitted for review, and that legislators with considerable experience in the publishing industry be added to the review, to make it more thorough. However, they opposed announcing the revised draft and soliciting opinions, because the Publication Law is administrative in nature, not procedural or customary, and there seemed to be no need to solicit opinions. Liang Hancao, Chen Guyuan, Zhao Chen, and others advocated starting the second reading of the revised draft according to the agenda, because the revision of the Publication Law is urgently needed in the current environment. Re-submitting for review would delay the opportunity. The chairman, in addition to expressing his own views, put the opinions of all parties to a vote. The result was still to start discussion according to the agenda. During the second reading, Cheng Zhongxing spoke the most, but few seconded his motions. Except for Article 21, which states that matters concerning personal or family privacy unrelated to public interest shall not be published, there was some debate among the members. The result was only to delete the five characters "unrelated to public interest." Also, in Article 14, Section 2, "The position and size of the text of the correction or rebuttal should be equivalent to that of the original text" was amended to delete "and the size of the text" and the following five characters. All other chapters and articles were not modified, and the third reading was entirely omitted and passed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is now known that the Ministry of Finance's proposed method for reorganizing Sichuan's finances is to issue 30 million yuan in Sichuan Financial Reorganization Treasury Bonds for the 24th year. The reason is that the Ministry of Finance considers Sichuan's financial situation to be extremely chaotic. The local banks it has established have not been approved by the central government, and the banknotes they have issued amount to more than 33 million yuan, without any reserve funds, resulting in frequent runs on the banks. The exchange rate between Chongqing and Shanghai is also often affected. Legally speaking, the central government should not be reorganizing it on its behalf. Since the Red Bandits infiltrated Sichuan, the military situation has been tense, and the financial resources have been exhausted. Sichuan Province has been unable to reorganize itself, and the market is in a state of extreme panic, which hinders the bandit suppression efforts. Therefore, the Central Bank established a branch in Chongqing, stopped the local banks from issuing banknotes, and, at the request of the Sichuan Provincial Government, borrowed 25 million yuan from the Central Chongqing Bank to reorganize the local banknotes. The Sichuan Provincial Tax Bureau was designated to allocate 550,000 yuan per month as the fund for issuing 26.4 million yuan in treasury bills from the Chongqing branch of the National Treasury, which were handed over to the Central Chongqing Bank as security for the loan's principal and interest. The Sichuan Provincial Government will raise the remaining 2.3 million yuan in local banknotes and prepare to hand them over to the Central Chongqing Bank for reorganization. The Ministry of Finance now believes that the Central Chongqing Bank has undertaken a large amount of this loan for reorganizing local banknotes, and is deeply concerned that the Central Bank will be overwhelmed and have difficulty managing it. Therefore, Kong Xiangxi proposed to the Central Political Committee that the central government issue 30 million yuan in Sichuan Financial Reorganization Treasury Bonds, specifically to recover the local banknotes of Sichuan Province. The local banknotes can be recovered in a short period of time, which is also consistent with unified issuance. The Central Bank's burden will be lighter. The Central Political Committee submitted it to the Legislative Yuan, which passed the bill on the 12th, and it can be issued on August 1. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>The Relief and Improvement of Prisons</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In recent years, rural areas in our country have gone bankrupt. People's livelihoods are deteriorating. Crimes are increasing day by day. Prisons everywhere are overcrowded. Even the more well-equipped modern prisons are holding more than double their capacity. With the limited capacity of prisons, the number of inmates has been increasing dramatically. Individual cells have become shared spaces. Workshops and classrooms have been converted into dormitories. There is no way to implement correctional policies. Even management and supplies are difficult to handle properly. Ignorant common people, who have accidentally violated the law and been sentenced to imprisonment, are often exposed to evil habits by associating with vicious criminals due to overcrowding and difficulty in isolation. They become increasingly degenerate. Furthermore, because prisoners live in close quarters, germs breed, leading to death in prison. This situation is particularly pitiful. Recently, the Judicial Yuan, recognizing this, has drafted measures to reduce sentences, which have been submitted to the Central Government for approval and implementation, hoping to relieve overcrowding. This is indeed an essential plan.</p>
<p>There are already methods for relieving prison overcrowding, such as suspended sentences and parole. However, due to the dramatic increase in the number of criminals in recent years, both new and old prisons have difficulty accommodating them. Therefore, two years ago, the judicial authorities suggested reducing sentences to alleviate the problems of suspended sentences and parole. The Central Political Committee decided to postpone the discussion. This case has not yet been implemented. However, in the past two years, the number of criminals has increased even more than before, and prisons have become even more crowded. In May and June of this year, the judicial authorities drafted measures to reduce sentences, reiterating the previous request. The Central Political Committee handed the matter over to the Legal System Group, the Legislative and Judicial Yuans, and the military and naval departments to send personnel to jointly review and mainly change the measures to reduce sentences into parole measures, which were submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan decided to change the parole measures into the Provisional Regulations for Relieving Prison Overcrowding, which was submitted to the plenary session of the Yuan on July 3 and passed. It will soon be promulgated and implemented. The problem of overcrowding in prisons everywhere should be relieved by this.</p>
<p>In addition to relieving prison overcrowding, prison improvement is also necessary today. Old-style prisons account for more than 90% of prisons in our country. Most are squalid and filthy. Medical facilities are even more rudimentary. According to the principle that punishment should improve criminals, prison facilities and treatment of prisoners should be actively improved so that the true spirit of justice can be fully realized. This is what we hope the judicial authorities will do within the scope possible, concurrently with relieving prison overcrowding.</p>
<p>However, the relief and improvement of prisons can only be considered as stopgap measures. To reduce the criminal element in society, we must think about the root causes. We must clarify official corruption, stabilize people's livelihoods, eliminate the motives for crime, and cut off the source of criminals. The ancients had a saying: "Removing the firewood from under the pot is better than ladling soup to stop boiling." That is what this means.</p>
<h3>Foreign Secretary Hoare Announces Britain's Far East Policy, Reaffirming Maintenance of the Open Door Policy and Acknowledging China's Right to Self-Determination</h3>
<p>(London) The coalition government led by Baldwin, not long established, faced its second test in the House of Commons last night and achieved a significant victory. The Labour Party's motion to reduce the diplomatic budget was defeated by a vote of 236 to 40.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first time the House of Commons debated foreign affairs since Baldwin came to power. Foreign Secretary Hoare delivered an important speech on Britain's Far East policy. Hoare said that the government firmly believes that China is moving towards steady progress in security and stability. The only way to maintain this is to promote good relations between China and Japan, and mutual cooperation between China and Japan and other countries with similar interests and objectives. In short, maintaining the principle of the Open Door Policy and fully acknowledging China's right to control its own destiny remain the broad basis of British policy. If China needs to restore its historical position in the world, it needs help from the West no less than from the East. The Foreign Secretary then made a concrete statement on the importance of Sino-British relations to the British government, citing the upgrading of the British Legation in China to an Embassy, the establishment of a better British ambassador's residence in Nanjing, and the dispatch of Sir Ross, the chief economic advisor, to China on an important economic mission. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Debate on Foreign Policy, A Great Verbal Battle in the British House of Commons, Labour Party Accuses the Government of Always Making Concessions, Making the League of Nations Lose Credibility and Cannot Escape Blame</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare delivered an important speech on foreign policy in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon, elaborating on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the European Security Organization, the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, the diplomatic relations between Britain and other countries, and the Far East issue. This is an important declaration of foreign policy by the British government. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Explaining the Anglo-German Agreement</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Hoare first explained the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, saying, "The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is by no means a selfish treaty. We will never sign any agreement that we consider detrimental to other naval powers. Taking France as an example, the conclusion of the Anglo-German Agreement actually made the naval position of France much more stable than before the war. Compared with the naval strength of France now and that of Britain and Germany, the Anglo-German Agreement actually makes the French navy forever surpass Germany by 43 percent. Before the war, the French navy was only 70 percent of Germany's. It can be seen from this that the Anglo-German Agreement is beneficial to France. I also know that those who value theory and those who value practical experience often see things differently. But in any case, if the practical policy adopted by the British government is conducive to peace, then it is already innocent to the world. If friendly countries criticize our practical policy without careful consideration, then I would like to tell them that friendly countries have also independently concluded international agreements in the past to maintain their own security and interests. Such agreements did not harm other countries, so they did not seek the opinions of other countries. At that time, the British government not only did not criticize them, but even sincerely supported them to promote them. The government still maintains the same spirit today and will always maintain it."</p>
<p>Supporting Collective Security</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then talked about the issue of collective security organizations, saying, "Although the British government is unwilling to get involved in the vortex of various disturbances in Europe in the future, it will never stand aside if it can help resolve the disturbances. Most countries in Europe regard Central and Eastern Europe as dangerous places. We don't need to list their names here. Some of these countries even hold a view that if Western European countries sign agreements such as the Sky Pact alone, without solving other peace problems at the same time, the result will cause an even more dangerous crisis in Eastern Europe than it is now. Although I dare not agree with this kind of anxiety, I do not deny that if war breaks out in Eastern or Central Europe, according to our experience, it may not be possible to affect the overall situation and cause a huge disaster. Because of this, we should now urgently strive to solve the existing difficulties that can cause the crisis. The British government hopes that the non-aggression treaties between Eastern European and Danube countries will be signed as soon as possible, but this depends on whether German leader Hitler can sincerely participate in the cause of peace. If Hitler can participate in peace work, then most countries in Europe will eliminate their various anxieties, not only in Eastern and Central Europe, but also in Western European countries. Therefore, I will urge Hitler to work for peace, and I think if he does so, it will not only benefit the whole of Europe, but also be beneficial to Germany itself. It is hoped that Hitler will take the necessary measures at this time to promote the negotiations on the conclusion of non-aggression treaties between Eastern European and Danube countries, which will also be of great help to the conclusion of the Sky Pact, because I know that the realization of the Sky Pact is what Hitler desires. Furthermore, the position of Austria in Europe is an important hub, both militarily and economically. If any changes occur in Austria's position, the foundation of European peace will be shaken. Therefore, we should continue to be concerned with the most sympathetic and earnest attitude to all the efforts made by the Austrian government and people to maintain and strengthen their independent existence. The British government's eagerness to realize the conclusion of non-aggression treaties and mutual non-interference in internal affairs conventions between the Danube countries is because maintaining Austria's position is one of the reasons. In short, to maintain the "principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of neighboring countries", it is necessary to make each country sufficient to protect itself, and willing to protect itself, before it is possible. We should certainly do everything possible to seek peace and construction, but empty talk is useless. This must be done with proper defense measures and defense actions. The British government always remembers the policy of realism. Otherwise, it would be detrimental to the responsibility of collective peace." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Mentioning the Italian-Abyssinian Issue</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then spoke about the Abyssinian affair, saying that Britain is extremely eager to maintain the principles on which the League of Nations was founded. We have no other purpose but to resolve the issue peacefully. The rumor that we are only concerned with colonial interests and that we have stationed heavy troops in neighboring British colonies is completely unfounded. We understand Italy's desire to develop overseas and recognize the legitimacy of its accusations against the Abyssinian government on several points. But can Italy's need for development and its accusations against the Abyssinian government be sufficient reasons for starting a war? The British government is now trying to use the 1906 treaty and the League of Nations to salvage the catastrophe. As for the rumor that the British government has asked the French government to join the blockade imposed on Italy, and that Britain is preparing to take unilateral action to threaten Italy, all of them are rumors and not true. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Promoting Friendship with Other Countries</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then spoke of Britain's friendship with China, France, Italy, the United States, Russia, and Japan, saying that Anglo-Russian relations are now very friendly, which has never been the case since the establishment of the Soviet government. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>As for France, we have been in harmony for thirty years. The enduring friendship between Britain and France is not accidental. First, both countries have adopted liberal political doctrines, which is often overlooked by the general public. Second, both countries are Western European countries, and their fates are closely linked. Third, the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 resolved European problems, and Britain and France share a common responsibility. Now, the plan to solve European problems established by the Paris Peace Conference needs to be changed. It is up to Britain and France to take responsibility for this. Therefore, the Anglo-French cooperation determined by the Anglo-French London Declaration and the Stresa Conference Communiqué on February 3 must be maintained. However, what is often stated is that we should take care of old friends on the one hand, and on the other hand, we should not prevent them from seeking new friends. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Labour Party Bitterly Criticizes the Government</p>
<p>(London) The highlight of last night's meeting of the House of Commons was the bitter criticism of the government's slow handling of affairs by MP Jones, who represented the Labour Party, i.e., the opposition party, at the end of the debate, and the statement by former British Prime Minister Lloyd George during the European War that the government had caused the League of Nations to lose credibility. Jones said that the government was too late for China, too late for Germany, and now almost too late for Abyssinia. The government has always been striving and has definite views on small and weak countries, but once a large and noisy threat appears, it immediately flees.</p>
<p>Eden Denies Ceding Territory</p>
<p>At this time, Secretary of State Eden quickly responded, saying, "If anyone thinks that Britain should cede its own territory when seeking reconciliation, this will be a feature of Britain's policy in the future, I must firmly deny this statement." (Cheers from the crowd)</p>
<p>Lloyd George Showed off His Eloquence</p>
<p>Then Lloyd George interjected, saying, "The credibility of the entire organization of the League of Nations has fallen to the ground. Japan has defied the League of Nations and acted arbitrarily in China, from one province to another. Even Paraguay and Bolivia have despised the League of Nations and fought each other endlessly, and finally stopped on their own. Germany has insulted the League of Nations, and Italy is now following suit. Every time countries gather in Geneva, wanting to implement the League of Nations Covenant, they always put their work in the hands of fools, causing cooperation to be lost. The German army, navy, and air force still exist, and the League of Nations has always been on a pile of waste paper. Hoare and Eden should understand the sad fact that the disarmament mechanism has completely disappeared, and the reconciliation mechanism is no longer trusted. It is necessary to find another way to unite all countries to preserve culture from catastrophe."</p>
<p>Chamberlain Responds</p>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain then took the floor, saying the opposite of what Lloyd George said, causing a great verbal battle between the two sides. But George finally claimed that Chamberlain was the person he least wanted to offend, and the argument stopped. According to Chamberlain's opinion, the obvious way for Britain is to stand before the Geneva Executive Council's proposal and declare that Britain is prepared to fulfill its obligations.</p>
<p>When Jones stood up to give the closing argument for the opposition party, the lights suddenly went out, and the whole venue was pitch black. Jones spoke loudly to the crowd in the dim candlelight, without losing his momentum. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary's Speech: Rome Welcomes, Paris Satisfied; International Gloom Instantly Cleared, Promising New Avenues for Future Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) Following British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, the response from various European countries has been largely positive. His remarks regarding the League of Nations have elicited great satisfaction in Geneva, as they perceive a tangible and positive shift in Britain's attitude towards European issues and the collective security system. The Foreign Secretary's speech has made a favorable impression in Rome. While Italian figures consider his tone satisfactory, Italian newspapers suggest that the potential impact of Britain's new stance remains to be seen, and Italy awaits further developments. In Rome, Hoare's remarks on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute are generally welcomed as a sign of Britain's progressive attitude. The news that Britain will not supply arms to Abyssinia is also well-received. However, the Roman newspaper Il Popolo di Roma argues that merely stating Britain's lack of ill intent is insufficient and requires concrete proof. The French press largely welcomes the British Foreign Secretary's remarks, believing that they could restore the normal Anglo-French relationship. Diplomatic circles also express satisfaction with the Foreign Secretary's forceful advocacy of Anglo-French cooperation. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Favorable Impression on French and Italian Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Paris) Diplomatic circles greatly welcome British Foreign Secretary Hoare's statement in the House of Commons. They are particularly pleased that Hoare, when mentioning the Air Pact, stated that "this pact should be jointly established by the five relevant countries (referring to Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium)," indicating that Britain and Germany will not enter into a bilateral treaty. Well-informed sources believe that negotiations on this matter will commence soon and clarify that Britain continues to support the organization of peace through collective policies, as is evident from Hoare's speech. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The major newspapers here have published commentaries on British Foreign Secretary Hoare's important speech in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon, in which he outlined the country's foreign policy. All consider it satisfactory. The right-wing Le Figaro writes, "This speech will undoubtedly clear the international gloom in one fell swoop and bring the ongoing negotiations between European countries back to a state of goodwill, in other words, a genuine collective consciousness and a genuine constructive consciousness." The socialist Le Populaire writes, "If a breeze of auspiciousness could have passed through the British House of Commons during yesterday's session, it would have swept away the mold from British policy." The communist L'Humanité writes, "Hoare's statement that peace is indivisible is utterly correct, but empty words are useless; they must be substantiated by actions." L'Intransigeant writes, "The British hope that Britain, France, and Italy will promptly hold negotiations to resolve the Abyssinian issue; this intention is abundantly clear. In short, Hoare's speech can be seen as an introduction to the upcoming diplomatic talks between nations, which is certainly a good thing, and Germany will undoubtedly participate actively in these talks." Le Petit Parisien says, "Hoare's speech is both realistic and noble, a good omen for future international negotiations. Britain has now returned to the framework defined by the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3rd and the Stresa Accords, which gives people a sense of relief. Moreover, Hoare's words about the friendship between Britain and France are sincere and strike a chord in the hearts of the French." Le Journal states, "Hoare yesterday, in clear terms, asked Germany to sign the Danube Pact and the Eastern European Pact, which coincides with the views of the French government, and France will naturally be happy to respond." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian newspapers, in their commentaries on British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons, uniformly emphasize the point that Britain recognizes Italy's right to expand its colonial territories. At the same time, Hoare's statement that he does not intend to take any coercive measures against Italy and his recognition of the need to maintain Austria's independence have given ample satisfaction here. Il Popolo d'Italia claims that while what the British Foreign Secretary said is nothing new, the tone is entirely new. Hoare's reiteration of the traditional friendship between Britain and Italy and his statement that the Stresa Front is still valid have been well-received in Italy. The only one to nitpick is Il Messaggero, which suggests that Britain's true attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian issue is difficult to grasp. Although Britain's attitude is now more moderate, its intention to protect Ethiopia is still quite evident. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>Mixed Reviews in the British Press</h3>
<p>(London) The press this morning offered mixed reviews of Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons yesterday. The Times stated that the Foreign Secretary's words clearly indicate two paths that can be followed to achieve solid justice and peace. The Morning Post stated that, after this debate, the so-called collective security or the League of Nations has almost ceased to exist. Our only hope is that our country has a practical awareness and dispels illusions. The Daily Mail stated that the Foreign Secretary's words are reassuring and do not echo the absurd cries of League of Nations fanatics who want Britain to adopt policies that criticize Italy. The News Chronicle stated that the Foreign Secretary's remarks on the government's attitude towards the League of Nations are unobjectionable, but when foreign countries address the real difficulties of the current situation, their actions within the League of Nations are very vague, unlike the straightforwardness of this declaration. The Daily Express stated that the Foreign Secretary declared that the government supports the League of Nations, but there was no action to inquire whether other countries are prepared to participate in collective action. The Foreign Secretary acknowledged Italy's need for overseas expansion and mentioned the application of the 1906 treaty, according to which Abyssinia was already divided into several economic spheres of influence. This is not the way to preserve peace, but a strategy to encourage war. The only opportunity to secure peace now is to be loyal to the League of Nations not only in word but also in deed. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>No Immediate Response from Berlin</h3>
<p>German Chancellor Hitler will closely study the British Foreign Secretary's remarks, so for the time being, German officialdom is unwilling to express any opinion. In general public opinion, the British Foreign Secretary's remarks "made a good impression, but there is a feeling that the Central European Pact is too complicated, and Berlin remains doubtful about whether Germany's participation in it is safe." (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung commented on the speech given yesterday in the House of Commons by British Foreign Secretary Hoare, stating briefly that the crux of Hoare's speech was to seek cooperation between Britain and France. How Britain will comfort France, connect with France, and persuade France is certainly what the world wants to know, and Hoare has now made it clear. Britain needs to cooperate with France because the Treaty of Versailles needs to be amended. Hoare deeply desires Anglo-French cooperation to amend the treaty. The Berliner Tageblatt stated that the new British Foreign Secretary Hoare has indicated that he will again adopt the French policy outline, which is well-suited to the needs of British policy. In short, we must not forget that British policy has various needs. We should not be intoxicated with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, thinking that there are no other problems in the world. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>German Pledge: Peace is Expected</h3>
<p>Vienna The Wiener Zeitung is quite optimistic about the European international situation fostered by British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons, advocating that Austria's independence must be maintained and that the Danube Pact should be concluded quickly, saying, "The British Foreign Secretary has confirmed the path to peace, and now all of Europe awaits a word from Hitler to decide." The semi-official Bundeszeitung stated, "The British Foreign Secretary has clearly indicated to Hitler that the Locarno Air Pact cannot be established without the Danube and Eastern Pacts." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<h3>Hungarian Press Notes Treaty Revision</h3>
<p>Budapest, the Hungarian capital Hungarian public opinion believes that British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech is sufficient to encourage a policy of revising the treaties. The newspapers pay special attention to Hoare's statement in his speech about changing the situation created in 1919 in order to seek lasting peace. The pro-German Magyar Hírlap stated, "Hoare is well aware that the treaties have caused serious damage to European peace." The neutral Pesti Napló stated, "Germany's attitude towards the issue of Austrian independence is ambiguous, and since Germany unilaterally abolished the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, France has been suspicious of Germany. These two things are the biggest obstacles to a practical solution to European problems. Now Hoare seems to be suggesting that international political talks be held to make Hitler express his attitude clearly." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japan Unwilling to Criticize Hastily</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to criticize British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech yesterday, as he has not yet seen the full text of his speech, stating that the telegrams are brief and should not be used to judge such a formal and rich theory. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italo-Ethiopian Dispute: Glimmer of Peace Appears, U.S. Closely Monitors the Situation, Hull Meets with British and French Ambassadors</h3>
<p>(Washington) After the diplomatic negotiations of the great powers, the Italo-Ethiopian dispute has today shown a slight glimmer of peaceful resolution. Italian Ambassador to the U.S. Rosso visited Secretary of State Hull today and said that he would soon return to Italy for a short stay before returning to his post. It is reported that Hull immediately dictated the U.S.'s views in its recent reply to Abyssinia, suggesting that the two countries still entrust the dispute to the League of Nations for handling and hoping that the two countries will not resort to force. After the conversation between the two, Hull then met with reporters, saying that he had informed the Italian ambassador that the United States was very concerned about maintaining world peace and was also closely monitoring the dispute between the two countries. After Hull met with the Italian ambassador, he also made informal contacts with the diplomatic representatives of the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Paris and London have both reported that the British and French governments intend to convene a tripartite meeting of Britain, France, and Italy to discuss the Abyssinian issue, so Hull immediately invited British Ambassador Lindsay and French Ambassador Laboulaye to the State Department for separate meetings. It is reported that Hull has made every effort to advocate that the U.S., Britain, and France should exchange more information and not focus solely on the dispute between the two countries. It is generally believed that Hull's meeting with the ambassadors of the two countries is particularly noteworthy, as this move indicates that the United States' interest in this African incident has increased. As for Rome, the senior officialdom is reportedly very cold towards the mediation conference proposed by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. Prime Minister Mussolini has always despised international conferences. The Italian army will hold autumn maneuvers in mid-August, with 500,000 participants. Italy's move is to show that its expedition to East Africa does not reduce its strength in Europe. During the exercises, regular troops and the Fascist Party army will be concentrated throughout the country to show that the Italian army does not need to be limited to activities in a certain special area or to carry out a certain special tactic, but can mobilize quickly in any part of the country at any time. At the end of the exercises, 14 divisions will be concentrated on the Austrian border for exercises, which will be personally commanded by Mussolini. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Arbitration Committee: Hopes for Reopening, League of Nations Publishes Three Statements, Italy Expresses Willingness to Continue Work, Ethiopian Representative Urges League of Nations Intervention</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations today published a memorandum stating that the Italian representatives on the Conciliation Committee held in Scheveningen have expressed their willingness to continue discussions with the Ethiopian representatives on July 20th in order to resolve the African dispute. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the adjournment of the Italo-Ethiopian Conciliation Committee, three statements have now been drafted and published by the League of Nations, one of which was signed by two Italian representatives, and the other two were signed by two Ethiopian representatives. In addition, there is a letter from the Ethiopian representative urging the League of Nations Administrative Council to pay attention to the urgency of intervention. The Italian representative's statement declared that the Ethiopian representative's raising of the sovereignty issue of Walwal was beyond the scope and should be resolved by the governments of the countries concerned. They are now willing to continue the discussion within the jurisdiction of the committee and suggest holding a meeting at another location. If this proposal is not accepted, the points of contention should be handled by the two governments. The Ethiopian representative declared that the Ethiopian government did not ask the committee to delimit the border, but believed that the important circumstances for determining the responsibility of various events should be considered. Italy's claim to this event has always been that Walwal belongs to Italy, but we cannot assume that this fact is so clear that it does not need to be discussed further. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Italo-Ethiopian Mixed Arbitration Committee is deadlocked due to the divergent opinions of the representatives of the two countries and has suspended work since the 9th. The League of Nations Secretariat has just published the arbitral awards of the Italian and Ethiopian arbitrators. The Italian arbitrators' award stated that the opinions of the agents of the two governments were inconsistent and should be resolved by the governments concerned through negotiation. The Italian and Ethiopian representatives had previously agreed in Geneva that the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Committee should only be limited to considering the facts and responsibilities of the Walwal incident, which was stated in the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council on May 25th. The Italian arbitrators are now prepared to carry out the work of the committee in accordance with the powers stipulated in the resolution, and even if this proposal does not receive the consent of the Ethiopian arbitrators, they still intend to have the committee reconvene on July 20th to find a way for the two governments to reach an understanding on the jurisdiction of the committee. The arbitral award of the Ethiopian arbitrators stated, "If the issue of sovereignty over the Walwal territory raised by the Ethiopian agent, Professor Schief, cannot be discussed in the Arbitration Committee, the power of the committee will be greatly reduced," and "Since the representatives of the two countries each insist on their own opinions and cannot agree, it is time for the Administrative Council to convene a meeting and appoint a fifth arbitrator in accordance with the May 25th resolution of the Administrative Council." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Italy Protests to Ethiopia, Using Two Recent Incidents as Pretexts</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to a communique issued here, the Italian government has now lodged two protests with the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one for the incident in which the Italian consul in Harar was insulted by Ethiopian soldiers, and the other for the incident in which local residents in Harar attacked an Italian soldier.

<h3>Britain Has Not Banned the Supply of Arms to Ethiopia; There is No Justification for Refusing to Issue Passports</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph verifies that the transport of British arms to Ethiopia has not been banned. Rumors that the government has refused to issue passports for the transport of arms to Ethiopia are completely unfounded. Even in recent days, a private arms company has accepted orders from Ethiopia, so it can be said that there is no reason for the government to refuse to issue export passports. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Southern Regent Arrives in Rome; Austrian Independence is the Topic of Conversation</h3>

Prince Paul will likely return to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on Sunday to meet with Greek Deputy Prime Minister Kondylis, who is traveling to Rome to meet with Mussolini. Kondylis will pass through Yugoslavia on his way back home and will take the opportunity to meet with the Southern Regent. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Outline of the Peace Plan of the American Peace Organization: Advocates Cooperation with Other Countries to Stabilize Currency, Adopts a Non-Intervention Policy Towards the Far East</h3>
<p>(New York) Van Kirk, president of the American Peace Association, representing 28 types of American peace organizations, stated that the result of the meeting was a decision to adopt a peace plan that includes the following outlines: (1) The United States must cooperate with other countries to stabilize international currencies, remove trade barriers, and resolve war debt issues. (2) Defense plans should be based on defending American territory, and the management of the arms industry must be sought through national strength and international action. (3) The United States must revise its current neutrality policy. (4) Expand the Good Neighbor Policy and the non-intervention policy, especially regarding the Far East. (5) Abolish the American policy of racial discrimination on immigration issues. (6) The United States must promptly join the League of Nations in accordance with the resolution proposed by Borah. Although this association is composed of various American peace organizations, the well-known American Foreign Policy Association is also among them, so its resolutions should not be taken lightly.

<h3>Japanese Army Holds Three-Chiefs Conference; Thousands of Officers to Undergo Major Changes</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The army held a formal three-chiefs conference at the Army Minister's official residence at 1:00 p.m. on the 12th regarding the routine personnel transfers scheduled for next month. Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in, Army Minister Hayashi, and Director General of Education Masaki gathered to deliberate on the promotion and transfer of military councilors, division commanders, and other key personnel of the rank of officer. Because opinions were not consistent on some parts, they were reserved for reconsideration and the meeting adjourned at 3:00 p.m. It was decided that the meeting would be reopened on the 15th and 16th of this month to make a final decision. However, it is reported that several military councilor positions will be vacant this time, and the reshuffling of the army's leadership will result in the transfer of two or three division commanders and a large number of other important officers such as brigade commanders and regimental commanders. The total number of personnel transfers, such as the commander of the Eastern Defense Command, which will be implemented on August 1st, and the newly established flight school and the replacement of other school principals and captains to strengthen the aviation unit, will reach thousands of people, which can be described as a rare major change in recent years.

<h3>Kwantung Army and South Manchuria Railway Investigate North China's Economy; Control Organizations Established in Tianjin, Matsumoto Reports on Tour of China Results</h3>
<p>(Changchun) South Manchuria Railway Vice President Hatta visited the commander-in-chief and other leaders of the Kwantung Army on the morning of the 11th and exchanged views on the development of North China's economy. As a result, the following policies were decided:</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a cadre meeting at 9:30 this morning, attended by Vice Minister Shigemitsu and other bureau chiefs. Matsumoto, an official who had toured North and South China for 50 days to inspect the status of anti-Japanese activities and the reality of the Chinese financial community, reported on the results of his visit to China for three hours. Afterwards, they agreed on a future policy of economic cooperation with China. The Foreign Ministry is now drafting concrete policies based on the report of Matsumoto, an official who is participating in the process. Taking advantage of the fact that the North China problem, the Chahar problem, and the Sinsheng incident have been resolved, the Foreign Ministry has decided to actively engage in a fundamental policy of economic assistance. The contents of Matsumoto's report are as follows: The National Government's suppression of anti-Japanese activities is gradually progressing throughout the country, so the sincerity of the Chinese side can be recognized. As a result of this inspection, from an economic point of view, it is imperative to establish consulates in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, and Nanning, Guangxi Province. (East Asia News Agency, 12th)</p>

The public statement concluded, "'Manchukuo' is responsible for defending the border, just like the Soviet Union." (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Tragic Earthquake in Shimizu, Shizuoka, Japan: Confusion and Terror Abounded</h3>
<p>Shizuoka The earthquake in Shizuoka and Shimizu cities at 5:25 p.m. yesterday occurred during dinnertime, and the vertical and horizontal shaking lasted for about a minute. The force was extremely strong, and the citizens were panicked. During the violent shaking, walls and fences collapsed one after another, and the sounds were endless for a while, instantly turning into streets of confusion and terror. The dining hall of the Toyo Morris Factory in Higashi-Wakamatsu, Shizuoka, caught fire at this time, and the citizens still struggled to put out the fire in a panic, fortunately preventing a major disaster. However, part of the factory's buildings collapsed, and 28 female workers were seriously injured. Telegrams, telephones, and electric lights were cut off in the city, and failures continued. The Tokaido Line was also impassable due to the collapse of the iron bridge. Thanks to the desperate efforts of the electricity department in Shizuoka, the city began to light up at 9:00 p.m., but Shimizu City was unable to recover, and the citizens spent the night outdoors in darkness and terror. It is believed that the areas near the mouth of the Abe River and the coastline of Otani, Kuno, and Takamatsu, which are thought to be the source of the earthquake, suffered the most damage, with more than 20 deaths in the Takamatsu area.

<h3>Shandong: Breach in the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>The Incident Site is on the South Bank of the Yellow River; Floodwaters Flow Towards Yuncheng and Heze</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River defenses in Shandong Province have always been considered solid. In recent years, although Hebei and Henan have repeatedly experienced risks, Shandong has safely passed through. This year, when the Guan Tai Koumen closure project was urgent, and Shandong was doing its best to reinforce the embankments along the river, the Guan Tai Koumen was closed, and the Jin Embankment was completed one after another. The Shandong embankment reinforcement project was also about to be completed. Just as it was expected that the flood season could be safely passed and peace could be celebrated, the news of a breach on the south bank of the Yellow River in Juancheng, Shandong, suddenly spread last night (the 10th). The people of Jinan were shocked and terrified. They believed that the Yangtze River flood was still in full swing, and the Yellow River in Shandong had also suffered a catastrophe. Looking ahead, the prospects were worrying. The provincial government chairman Han Fuju and Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau Zhang Lianjia immediately ordered all counties to step up prevention to avoid expansion after receiving the report. The details of the breach and the telegrams issued by the Water Conservancy Bureau are recorded below:</p>
<p>Breach Location</p>
<p>The breach location is located between Linpu Village and Dongzhuang in the Juancheng County territory on the south bank of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, right at the easternmost end of the newly built Zhulin Embankment. This section of the embankment was reinforced with 110,000 yuan allocated by the central government from Zhukou to Linpu Village. At 8:00 PM on the 10th, due to the very high river water level, the small people's embankments on the south bank were first overflowed. Then, the embankment between Dongzhuang and Linpu Village was breached. At that time, the water force was extremely strong, and it was at night, so it was sudden and could not be prevented. The Yellow River immediately rushed eastward from the bank, flowing into Yuncheng County and Heze County within four hours. The speed of its flow can be imagined. According to the trend of the water flow, it is feared that it may flow into the Grand Canal. After receiving a report from a section chief in Juancheng late at night on the 8th, Governor Han Fuju immediately ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to notify and ordered the magistrates of Juancheng and Yuncheng Counties to supervise the civilians day and night to do their best to block the breach to prevent the expansion of the disaster area, and ordered the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau Zhang Lianjia and Chief of the General Affairs Section Zhao Luren to immediately go to the bureau to work that night. At the same time, he also issued a notice to the magistrates of Juancheng, Pingyin, Feicheng, and Dong'a Counties to personally lead civilians to the shore to strictly defend.</p>
<p>Process of No Increase</p>
<p>Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau Zhang Lianjia telegraphed the provincial government to report on the water increase. The various telegrams are as follows: (1) Shandong Provincial Government, Han Junjian, steamed afternoon telegram from Shaanxi Prefecture, from 8:00 PM on the 7th to 5:00 AM on the 8th, the river water suddenly increased by 2.5 meters, and the flow increased from 6qiang to 9,980 cubic meters per second. The flood was soaring, exceeding the water level that had not been seen for many years. In addition to telegraphing each section to defend properly, I hereby send a telegram to inform you, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau Zhang Shujia Kouding. (2) Urgent, Chairman Han Junjian, Steamed Afternoon, received a telegram from the Yellow River Commission, the river water in Shaanxi County increased by 2.5 meters, and I have already telegraphed to inform you. Recently, according to Du Shutian, the section chief of the first southern section, who urgently telegraphed, because the water in Li Sheng Tun in the upper reaches rose too sharply, a hole protruded from the seven-dam lower circle dike, and while it was being rushed to block, several leaks appeared in the people's embankment under the ten-dam dam. He immediately supervised the soldiers and civilians to try their best to rush to block, but the people's embankment has already overflowed, and the depth of the dike root is more than one meter, but the water rises too sharply, the dike is short and the water is high, the top of the dike is level everywhere, and it is impossible to rush to win. In addition to dispatching more civilians to fight desperately to overcome nature, I hereby send a telegram to inform you first, Director of the Shandong Water Conservancy Bureau Zhang Lianjia Kouding. (3) Limited to immediate arrival, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission in Kaifeng, Li Junjian, immediately submitted to Chairman Han Junjian. Check the small people's embankment in Li Sheng Tun on the south bank of the upper reaches, because the water rose and overflowed the dike root with a depth of more than three meters, the critical situation has already been telegraphed to inform you. Recently, according to Du Shutian, the section chief of the first southern section, in a steamed you urgent telegram, after the small people's embankment in Dongzhuang Linpu Village overflowed, the water was very strong and continued to soar. The height exceeded the top of the newly added dike. Although more soldiers and civilians were dispatched to protect it desperately, it was impossible to rush to win everywhere, and it overflowed between Dongzhuang Linpu Village. Check the dike body in that place, fearing that it would be difficult to resist the grand increase, and just added five feet of uneven height. This water rise was sudden, and it exceeded the top of the new dike, so it was difficult to apply manpower, and the sudden failure was really unexpected. I, Lianjia, have failed to perform my duties, and the blame cannot be shirked. I beg you to give me punishment to show warning, and I am extremely fearful and await orders, Director of the Shandong Water Conservancy Bureau Zhang Lianjia Kouding. (4) The Water Conservancy Bureau ordered the counties of He, Juan, Yun, Dong, Wen, and A to strictly prevent the water head telegram, to be handed over to Yun, urgent, magistrates of Heze, Juancheng, Yuncheng, Dongping, Wenshang, and Dong'a. Because the river water has been soaring, the water level has exceeded the number that has not been seen. The small people's embankment and the dike west of Linpu Village are all higher than the dike, and manpower cannot resist. It is impossible to rush to win. It overflowed between Linpu Dongzhuang on Steamed Wu. It is necessary to defend it properly, Zhang Lianjia Kouding.</p>
<p>Water Diversion</p>
<p>According to the Jinan long-distance telephone report, after the Yellow River breached between Dongzhuang and Linpu Village in the territory of Juancheng in the upper reaches, there were two breaches, one was more than forty zhang wide, and the other was more than fifty zhang wide. They flowed south over the levee, and the momentum was extremely turbulent. The water divided into two streams, one flowing towards Yuncheng and the other flowing towards Heze. The one flowing towards Yuncheng was divided into two streams, one flowing east and one flowing north, after reaching Huang'an. One stream flowed east towards the Zhao Wangzhu and Shui two rivers, and the other stream flowed north from Yuncheng, passing through Jiaxiang and heading straight for Nanyang Lake. After receiving the report, Wang Shaochang, the chief of the Shandong County Government Construction Experiment Area, reported to the provincial government by telephone and ordered the magistrate of Zoucheng County to rush to block it and ordered that a people's embankment be built east and west along the Yellow River Bank in the northern part of Heze, connecting Juye to the side, to prevent it. Juye and Heze counties have started construction and will be completed on the 11th or 12th. (11th)</p>

<h3>Henan Province: Yanshi County City Submerged; Mountain Torrent Erupts on Western Section of Longhai Railway, Over a Thousand People Drowned in Yanshi</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xuzhou reports that the western section of the Longhai Railway, including areas in central Shaanxi and western Henan, has experienced successive heavy rains, causing mountain torrents and substantial flooding. Traffic between Tongguan and Xi'an has been disrupted since the sixth. The area near Yanshi has also seen the railway tracks submerged. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tongxi Road Blocked</p>
<p>Xi'an initially experienced severe drought, followed by continuous heavy rain for three days and nights, causing rivers to swell. Bridges near Xi'an, including the Baqiao Bridge, sustained minor damage. While not impeding traffic, the newly constructed roadbed is loose and unstable. The roadbed east of Huayin to Donghuadian, though built earlier, also shows signs of loosening. To ensure travel safety, the railway bureau has instructed stations to only sell tickets to Tongguan. After reaching Tongguan, unofficial transport can still reach Xi'an. According to railway personnel, the Tongxi roadbed has not suffered major damage but is loose due to its new construction. Repairs cannot be properly completed until the weather clears and the sun dries it. The slow train has already reached Weinan, and it is expected that express trains can resume service to Xi'an within a week.</p>
<p>Yanshi Submerged</p>
<p>Yanshi City is located two miles south of the Longhai Railway, between the Yi and Luo Rivers, in a low-lying area. Last year, the Luo River flooded, inundating the city for one to two months. The low elevation is evident. On the morning of the eighth, mountain torrents erupted in the Songshan area, flowing into the Luo River. The Luo River channel, already inadequately dredged, could not contain the massive volume of water, causing it to overflow its banks. Yanshi City had a protective city wall, but the floodwaters were too powerful, breaching the wall. Residents initially tried to reinforce the wall, but the mountain torrents flowed from high to low, and the Luo River flooded the city from high to low. By the afternoon, the water had breached the wall. Residents abandoned their homes and belongings, fleeing to the wall or city towers. On the evening of the eighth, the water level was almost as high as the city. Passengers passing Yanshi Station saw only a vast expanse of water, with only the treetops visible. Only the roof decorations of the Guandi Temple outside the city were visible. Over a thousand people drowned, and countless possessions were swept away. Damage statistics are currently unavailable.</p>
<p>Wading Through Water</p>
<p>After flooding Yanshi, the Luo River flowed south to north, reaching the vicinity of Yanshi Station. The water level was even with the tracks, and between markers 80 and 84 east of Yanshi Station, for about five or six miles, the roadbed was slightly lower, and the water submerged the tracks by a foot, flooding northward. Fortunately, that section of the roadbed was older, hardened by wind, sun, rain, and water, and the foundation remained intact. The railway bureau continued to allow trains to pass through the water to maintain traffic. On the eighth and ninth, passenger trains passing through Yanshi were led by a pilot engine, slowly wading through the water. This section took three hours to traverse, so traffic was not suspended. Therefore, Xuzhou Station continued to sell tickets to Tongguan. Rumors that western trains only reached Zhengzhou are false. On the evening of the ninth, the water level dropped six feet. Railway officials were confident that the western train of the eleventh would arrive on time.</p>
<p>Overflowing into the River</p>
<p>The Luo River normally flows northeast south of Yanshi. With the floodwaters overflowing uncontrollably, they flowed regardless of river channels or fields. The Luo River channel flows through Gong County, so the floodwaters flowed to Gong, mostly draining into the Yellow River. Railway officials are repairing the roadbed. Although the water level in Yanshi City has dropped slightly, due to its low elevation, it cannot flow out and must be pumped out. Generally, Gong County and Yanshi are the lowest-lying cities along the western section of the Longhai Railway. Gong County has already been relocated, and Yanshi should also consider relocation to prevent flooding. (10th)</p>
<h3>The Xiang and Han Rivers Surge Again; Wuhan Dike Gates in Extreme Danger; Fancheng and Tianmen Suffer the Most Severe Disasters</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that after reaching 48 feet 9 inches on the ninth, the Han River water level stabilized slightly, easing concerns. However, on the eleventh, it surged again, reaching 49 feet 7 inches, only 3 feet 3 inches below the highest level recorded in 1931. Simultaneously, the Xiang River's headwaters arrived, causing water to overflow onto the banks near the Jianghan Customs and Qiaokou areas. The upstream disaster remains severe. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>On the eleventh, the Jiang and Xiang Rivers both surged, causing widespread panic. Water overflowed onto the banks in Qiaokou and near the Jianghan Customs. The Zhanggong Dike, Danshuichi, Fenjinlu, and Chenjiaji all show signs of danger. Leakage is especially severe at Chenjiaji. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is responsible for supervising the emergency repairs of the Zhanggong Dike. The Municipal Flood Prevention Committee, Municipal Government, and Jianghan Engineering Bureau are jointly responsible for the other dikes. All the above dikes are vital to protecting Wuhan. If one breaches, the city will be flooded. On the Wuchang side, the Wuhui Dike is the most dangerous. On the tenth and eleventh, there were over twenty leaks, with five or six dike bases bulging, spanning over twenty miles. The water level outside the dike is one to two *zhang* higher than inside. According to a report by Yang Shisheng, the Wuchang County Magistrate, the dike is in danger even without strong winds or rain and could breach at any moment. Zhoujiagang and Youjiazu, from Jinkou to Baiguan, are also in grave danger. On the Hanyang side, many sections of the dike have already breached. It was reported that on the tenth, some people dug through the Defeng Dike to release water. The military headquarters has ordered the provincial government to take strict precautions. Forty to fifty thousand disaster victims are being sheltered and provided relief. The military headquarters is also planning epidemic prevention measures for the victims.</p>
<p>The disaster situation is severe in all counties along the upper reaches of the Han River. Yichang, Shashi, and Jiangling have been flooded for days, with countless people drowned. Although there was some preparation beforehand, allowing some people to escape, Fancheng and Tianmen experienced a more sudden and severe disaster. According to a telegram from the Fancheng Flood Relief Committee, the floodwaters exceeded the city walls at around 2 AM on the seventh, inundating the urban area. Sixty percent of the city's houses collapsed, and seventy percent of the property was lost. The number of citizens drowned or dead accounted for more than one-third of the city's population. Surviving victims have been without food for three days due to the lack of stored grain. Furthermore, the Sangongdian Eleventh Labor Dike in Zhongxiang County, the only major dike of the Han River, is vital to the livelihood of over ten counties including Jingshan, Tianmen, Hanchuan, Yingcheng, Huangpi, and Xiaogan. It was built by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. On the late night of the eighth, due to the Han River's surge, it completely breached. Tianmen was hit first, and the floodwaters flowed directly over the city walls and into the city. The entire city was flooded. The Sixth District Administrative Commissioner's Office is located in the city, and boats can navigate to the roof of the office. All the villages outside the city suffered severe flooding. It is reported that over 100,000 people have drowned. The tragic scene is beyond description. (11th)</p>
<h3>Border Between Jiangxi and Anhui: The Mahua Dike Suddenly Breaches; Authorities in Charge are Engaged in Rescue Efforts; The Yigong Dike in Jiujiang Also Breaches</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang reports that the Yangtze River flood is comparable to the disaster of 1931. The Yangtze River water level in Jiujiang remained at 45 feet 6 inches on the eighth and ninth. In northern Jiangxi, the situation is extremely serious due to the combined pressure from the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. All the newly built dikes in Nanchang, Jiujiang, Hukou, and Pengze are only a few inches above the water level. Chief Engineer Qiu of the Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau, Chief Engineer Zhu of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, and Secretary-General Qin of the National Economic Commission have all successively arrived in the Yangtze River area in northern Jiangxi and southern Anhui to supervise emergency repairs. However, the Mahua Dike, which connects Pengze with Qiupu and Dongliu, faces difficulties in draining accumulated water, and is under fierce attack from the floodwaters. On the ninth, the Yujiabu section of the Mahua Dike suddenly breached as the water level slightly receded. Fields and villages within the dikes in both provinces were flooded, resulting in countless losses. Secretary-General Qin of the Economic Commission, Chairman Liu Zhenhua of Anhui Province, Deputy Director Zheng of the Water Conservancy Department, and Chairman Fu of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission have all arrived in Xunyang to inspect the dike and direct efforts to close the breach to prevent it from widening. Before the breach in the Mahua Dike, the Yigong Dike in the third district of Jiujiang County breached for more than ten *zhang* on the sixth. Over a hundred dikes have breached along Poyang Lake, the Yangtze River, and the lower reaches of the Gan River in Yongxiu and Poyang Lake. Over forty counties in this province have reported disasters. After receiving the reports, the provincial government decided to: (1) have the Relief Committee handle emergency relief in various locations; (2) have the Rural Cooperative Association provide autumn crop seeds to the disaster areas; (3) have the Water Conservancy Bureau repair the breached dikes; and (4) inform the central government of the disaster and request relief. These measures are already being implemented. (July 10th)</p>
<h3>Guo Shijin Launches Suppression Campaign in Daming; Fierce Battles with the Jinshengdao Bandits; Bandits Fleeing Toward Guangping</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin reports that the Jinshengdao bandits in Daming besieged the county seat and cut off traffic. The Hebei provincial government sent two investigators to assist Commander Guo Xipeng of the Fourth Cavalry Division and Daming County Magistrate Gan Tingheng in seeking a peaceful resolution. Local gentry were found to contact the brothers Zhao Dehuai, leaders of the Jinshengdao bandits, and propose four conditions: (1) Zhao Dehuai's brothers' past actions will not be investigated, allowing them to reform; (2) arrested Jinshengdao leaders will be handed over to the court, but not punished under the regulations for punishing bandits and harming the Republic; (3) the government will provide 3,000 yuan for the Zhao Dehuai brothers to disband the bandits; (4) the siege of Daming City will be lifted immediately, the bandits will withdraw from villages and towns, and captured police officers will be released. Initially, the Zhao brothers considered accepting the conditions, but after receiving assistance from bandits in western Shandong, their strength increased, and they suddenly rejected mediation. On the afternoon of the third, they surrounded and disarmed several hundred members of the Weixian militia. At this point, Commander Guo of Daming felt he could no longer tolerate the situation. He telegraphed the Beiping Military Branch, and at 11:00 AM on the fourth, fierce clashes erupted between the troops and the bandits at the border between Weixian and Daming. The two sides fought near Matou Village and Shawoji, 25 *li* west of Daming City. The bandits occupied Jin Tanji, Shuang Miaoji, and other villages north of Matou Village. The Third Regiment of the Fourth Cavalry Division surrounded Shawoji, blocking the bandits' path to attack the county seat. The First Regiment of cavalry was dispatched to Daming on the fifth to assist the military and police in defense. From the morning of the fifth to the afternoon, the two sides engaged in several more fierce battles. Over a hundred bandits were killed, and corpses littered the fields. Commander Guo's troops also suffered casualties. The fighting resumed for three hours at night. The bandits were routed and fled towards Guangping in the northeast. Commander Guo is pursuing them. The telephone and telegraph lines to Handan and Daming have been cut by the bandits. The Daming-Handan highway is also blocked. People from Yongnian, Daming, Feixiang, and Weixian are fleeing. The police and militia from four townships in Yongnian County have entered the city to assist in defense. There are still four to five thousand bandits on the run. Their main camps in Jin Tanji and Shuang Miaoji have been abandoned. Commander Guo is pursuing the bandits while also notifying neighboring provinces' troops to prevent the bandits from expanding their area of disturbance. Shandong has dispatched the Eighty-seventh Brigade and the Sixty-sixth Brigade to establish defenses at the border between Hebei and Shandong. Therefore, despite the large number of bandits, they will inevitably be trapped.</p>
<p>According to another report from Quzhou, Li Jiabin, the platoon leader of the Eighty-fourth Tax Police Team stationed in the area, led his team to seize six carts of saltpeter in Sifurenzhai Village. He was then surrounded by over six hundred saltpeter bandits and their society within Sifurenzhai Village, disarmed, and the prisoners were seized. Several tax police, including Zhang Yin, were killed. Over ten saltpeter bandits were captured. The two sides are still in a standoff. Furthermore, hundreds of saltpeter bandits similar to those in Daming have been discovered in Pingxiang. On the third of this month, they surrounded the Seventy-ninth Tax Police Team stationed in Jiegucun Village in Pingxiang, attempting to disarm them. Platoon Leader Yang led his team to resist. The fighting continued until dawn on the fourth, when Battalion Commander Cui of the Tax Police Armory Battalion stationed in the county seat led his troops to reinforce. The saltpeter bandits then retreated. With the outbreak of fighting between the bandits and the garrison troops in Daming, and due to the interconnectedness of the local saltpeter bandits and their long-standing grievances with the tax police, clashes are possible at any time.

<h3>Huang Detian, a Key Bandit in the Eastern River Region of Guangdong Province, Surrenders; Nanshan Bandit Nest Already Broken; Huang Had No Base of Operations and Therefore Surrendered</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou reports that Nanshan, at the junction of Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai in the eastern part of Guangdong province, had long been a haven for communist bandits and had been repeatedly besieged by the army. It was only in the previous month that the area was cleared. Huang Detian, a standing committee member of the Communist Party's Eastern River Special Committee, personally brought five guards, carrying guns, to the regiment headquarters of Wang Dequan in Huilai County, requesting permission to surrender. According to Huang, he was inducted into the Communist Party in the spring of 1927 by Huang Fu of the Huilai County Farmers' Association and served as an executive committee member in the local Farmers' Association. In April, the Huilai County Farmers' Self-Defense Army was summoned to Hailufeng and entered Hunan under the leadership of the Red Army's general team leader. At this time, Huang Detian also returned home to farm. In February 1928, Peng Pai and Huang Fu appointed Huang Detian as a member of the Huilai County government. He was then surrounded and suppressed by the National Army and retreated to Nanshan. In September of the same year, he went to Hong Kong. In January 1929, he returned home for several days and then went to Nanshan to visit Fang Guangqing, the county committee secretary, and was reappointed as a special commissioner for sixteen townships, including Dongyang. In the winter of the same year, a puppet district Soviet government was established, and Huang served as its chairman, as well as the deputy chairman of the county Soviet government. In the winter of 1930, the Chaozhou-Puning-Huilai three-county Soviet government was established, with Fang Guangqing as chairman and Huang promoted to deputy chairman. The Communist Party's land redistribution and rice confiscation laws were not perfect, and Huang strongly advocated for improvement. He was accused by his comrades of pursuing a "rich peasant policy," expelled from the party, and removed from his position. He was reassigned to work on mass movements in the White area of Kuitan. In the spring of 1931, due to a shortage of personnel to clear AB Groups, he was appointed as the chairman of the Kuitan District Soviet. In 1932, when Zhang Ruigui's division launched a suppression campaign, the internal work of the bandit area became tense. In June, he was reinstated as a member of the Communist Party and continued to work in Kuitan until January 1933, when he served as the acting chairman of the Chaozhou-Puning-Huilai County Soviet Government. In January 1934, the Nanshan Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Representative Conference was held, and he was elected as chairman. In September of the same year, the Eastern River Party Conference was convened, and he was again elected as one of the standing committee members of the Eastern River Special Committee. He was re-elected to the standing committee at a meeting in April of this year. The above is a brief account of his experiences joining the Communist Party. As for the situation of the bandit nest in Nanshan, tracing back to the purge of 1927, the Communist bandits reorganized the armed Farmers' Self-Defense Army of various counties into the Red Guerrilla. In 1928, the 47th Red Army Regiment was established, with He Shi as the commander. Each regiment had only 300 soldiers. The bandit Gu Dacun used five regiments of bandits to establish the 11th Army, with Gu himself as the puppet army commander. In the winter of 1929, the 47th Regiment was transferred to western Fujian, and Nanshan was changed to the Third Military Region, with Cai Duan from Haijue as the instructor. There were over 200 combatants in the unit. A county Soviet government political security team was also formed, with 30 Mauser pistols. In 1931, with the purge of AB Groups, the number of cadres decreased to one-third. Two Red Army regiments from Wuhua and Fengshun were transferred to Nanshan, greatly increasing their strength and attracting the attention of the government army. In 1932, Zhang Ruigui blockaded and suppressed the area, gradually reducing it. The troops were reorganized into smaller units, and they scattered throughout Chaozhou, Chenghai, and RaoPing counties, dispersing the government army's attention. Only one Red Army company remained in Nanshan, combined with the guerrillas, totaling over 200 guns. Since Commander Deng launched an attack and Wang's regiment entered the mountains to search and suppress, over 100 guns have been seized, and the remaining bandits have scattered to Pingyang and other places to hide, engaging in looting to survive. As for the policies implemented by the Communist bandits over the years, as far as he knows, from 1927 to 1930, it was the Li Lisan line. Because Li Lisan followed the principle of "rich peasant policy", advocating the seizure of various places, making poor farmers rich, and not confiscating the property of capitalists, only allowing the extortion of ransom tickets, with no fixed standard for ransom. Secondly, there was no establishment of cultural, educational, or economic construction. From 1930 to 1932, the policies of land distribution and anti-espionage were implemented. The so-called land distribution meant distributing fertile land to rich peasants and abundant land to middle peasants. The so-called anti-espionage meant clearing AB Groups, the Social Democratic Party, Trotskyists, Revisionists, and Reorganizationists. The Communist Party strictly enforced this at the time, regardless of whether it was voluntary or passive, and everyone was imprisoned or killed. After 1932, it became the international line, which was the main motivation for Zhu De and Mao Zedong's westward escape. All small organizations, from top to bottom, were absolutely under the command of the Third International. The banner of the Northern Anti-Japanese Workers' and Peasants' Army was raised from then on. At the same time, within the bandit area, civilian schools were established, land was redistributed, training classes for village committees were opened, and military cadres were trained. Arms repair factories were built, and the confiscation of capitalists' property was advocated. Huang realized that after working in the bandit area for eight years, the Communist Party's methods were all about deception, brutality, and using others as sacrificial tools, harming relatives and friends. It did not benefit himself, others, society, or the country in the slightest. For eight years, he had lived in caves, enduring a life of exposure to the elements and suffering inhuman conditions. He believed that continuing to work hard was useless. Preserving his remaining life would also lack the joy of living. The bandits of Nanshan will soon be suppressed, and he is willing to surrender and return home.</p>
<h3>Ten Prisoners Escape from Xiamen Prison; Tunnel Six Feet Deep and Over Ten Feet Long; Project Took Over Two Weeks</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xiamen reports that ten prisoners escaped from Xiamen Court Prison on the morning of the seventh through a pre-dug tunnel. When prison officials discovered the escape and notified the public security agencies to assist in the arrest, the prisoners were already gone. Xiamen Prison is extremely cramped, and the order is extremely chaotic. After prisoners exposed corruption by prison officials last month, the court authorities sent personnel to supervise, and the shackles of important prisoners were removed. He Chaofa, the guard on duty in the inner shift, went out to gamble after roll call at 8:00 AM. Jiang Junzhuang, the guard on duty in the outer shift, was also negligent in his patrol. At 4:00 AM on the morning of the seventh, when Zhang Shiliang, the duty officer in the inner shift, took over, he saw that only three of the original thirteen prisoners remained in cell number seven, and realized that ten had escaped. According to the three prisoners who remained in the cell, the ten escapees had escaped through a pre-dug tunnel during the heavy rain at 2:00 AM that night. A hole was found under the prisoners' beds, six feet deep and three feet in diameter, leading to a tunnel of the same diameter, over ten feet long, that reached a ditch outside the wall. They lifted a stone slab and escaped. The public security bureau dispatched a team to search, but the prisoners were already gone. The ten escapees are: (1) Chen Jincai, from Jinjiang, 29 years old, convicted of extortion, sentenced to life imprisonment; (2) Chen Xiangfa, from Hui'an, 27 years old, convicted of theft, sentenced to one year and six months, fined 100 yuan; (3) Chen Dan'gang, from Tongan, 21 years old, convicted of robbery, sentenced to four years; (4) Lin Bangjie, from Shima, convicted of robbery, sentenced to seven years; (5) Chen Taishan, from Anxi, 22 years old, charged with murder, awaiting judgment; the above five were held on behalf of the First Branch of the High Court; (6) Chen Shuiyu, from Tongan, 20 years old, convicted of abduction and flight, sentenced to two years; (7) Wang Yu, from Haicheng, 24 years old, convicted of theft, sentenced to six months; (8) Wang Fude, from Shandong, 37 years old, convicted of assault, sentenced to one year and six months; (9) Guo Ji, from Nan'an, 21 years old, convicted of robbery, sentenced to six months; (10) Li Feiren, from Guangdong, 28 years old, convicted of communism, sentenced to five years; the above five were held on behalf of the local court. The court inspected the tunnel and determined that it was dug using two wooden spikes, sharpened at the ends, to break the concrete surface, and then using wood and a cigarette tin to dig the soil. The excavated soil was stored in broken felt cloths and quilt covers, cut and sewn into bags, hidden under the beds, or used as pillows, totaling over fifty bags. Some of the bagged soil had already dried. Based on the width and length of the tunnel and the tools used, as well as the moisture content of the soil, it was estimated that the project took over two weeks. According to the three prisoners who remained in the cell, the escape was initiated by Chen Jincai and Li Feiren, and the work began twenty days ago. Every night at 9:00 PM, they took turns working, while one person told stories in the cell, speaking loudly to create noise and distract the guards. On the night of the sixth, the tunnel was completed. It rained that night, so they escaped. The three who did not escape were opium addict Xu Fu, whose sentence expired on July 12, Pan Pingshan, convicted of theft, whose sentence expired on the eighth, and Yang Yuqi, an opium addict, whose sentence expired on the seventh. The three were about to be released, so they did not want to escape. However, they were threatened and kept the secret beforehand, assisting in the work and promising to cover the bed boards afterwards in exchange for not being forced to escape. After this case occurred, the two guards, He and Jiang, have been detained, and responsible personnel below the warden are under surveillance pending investigation. (July 11th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Qingdao reports that the Fourth National Railway Product Exhibition, sponsored by the Ministry of Railways, opened at 3:00 PM on the tenth of this month at the Municipal Middle School on Wendeng Road. Attendees included Mayor Shen Honglie, Zhang Honglie representing Chairman Han, Ge Guangting, the director of the Jiaoji Railway, key officials and employees of the Jiaoji Railway, directors of bureaus and offices under the municipal government, consuls from various countries, and representatives from all sectors of society, totaling approximately one thousand people.

He delivered the opening remarks, explaining the significance of the railway product exhibition and the preparation process. Subsequently, Zhang Honglie, representing Chairman Han, and Shen Honglie, the Mayor of Qingdao, delivered speeches. The ceremony concluded at 4:00 PM, and the exhibition was opened to the public. Yu Yan and other key officials of the exhibition guided the guests, leading them to visit the exhibits in each hall in order. At each hall, the director of the hall welcomed them and provided detailed explanations of the exhibits. However, because the opening time was late (the visiting time was only one hour), although only five to six thousand people visited, each hall already felt extremely crowded, and many were unable to visit and left disappointed. The visiting hours for the exhibition are from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and it will also be open on Sundays.</p>
<p>The exhibition venue is located at the Municipal Middle School, with mountains behind and water in front, making for pleasant scenery. There is a wooden archway erected at each entrance and exit. The police sent by the temporary security office organized by the Jiaoji Railway Bureau are maintaining order inside and outside the venue. It is divided into two courtyards. In the first courtyard, the left side of the first floor is the Famous Products Hall, and the right side is the Jinpu Hall. On the second floor, the left side is the Jinghu and Huhu-Ningbo Hall, the center is the Zhej赣 Hall, and the right side is the Pinghan Hall. In the second courtyard, the left side of the first floor is the Beining Hall, the center is the Zhengtai Hall, and the right side is the Jiaoji Hall. On the second floor, the left side is the Pingsui Hall, the center is the Longhai Hall, and the right side is the Yuehan Hall. There is another Jiaoji Branch Hall behind the courtyard, which contains iron products made by the Sifang Locomotive Factory of the Jiaoji Railway.

Sound systems are installed in important locations in each hall, broadcasting music records at any time to entertain the audience. Movies are shown in the auditorium of the venue from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day, twice a day. Tickets cost ten cents. Those who purchase goods worth over five yuan in the sales booth can exchange their invoice for a free movie voucher. The films are mostly scenery along the railway lines. The sales booths are located on the east open space of the first courtyard, temporarily constructed with reed mats, lined up closely. There are a total of 568 sales merchants, plus 23 food and beverage stores. The sales booth area is bustling with people and quite crowded. (10th)</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Yichang and Two Other Silk Factories Close Down</p>
<p>The Taifu Silk Factory, located outside the South Gate of this county in Shangtang, was leased by Huang Fulin from Liyang, who renamed it Yichang. It had 320 silk reeling machines. It started operating last year. In the second month of this year, it continued to lease the Jintai Silk Factory under Kuatang Bridge (with 144 silk reeling machines, renamed Yichang Second Factory) and the Yu Lun Silk Factory under Tiechu Bridge (with 256 silk reeling machines, renamed Yichang Third Factory). These factories commenced operations one after another. When Huang started buying cocoons, he went to Liyang to collect them, only issuing promissory notes. Recently, various cocoon farmers repeatedly pursued the factory for payment but were unable to obtain it. Consequently, it suddenly closed down on the 12th. The key staff in the factory fled. Huang also absconded beforehand. All the stored silk and dried cocoons had been transported away early. Considering the situation, it seems to be a planned shutdown. A substantial amount of wages is owed. As there is no one responsible in the factory, there is no one to negotiate with. Currently, all relevant parties will jointly accuse Huang of fraud.</p>
<p>The County Government Plans to Establish a Plague Hospital</p>
<p>The County Government held its first epidemic prevention meeting on the afternoon of the 12th at 2:00 PM, chaired by Wang Binxuan. The resolutions were: 1. The county's epidemic prevention hospital will commence consultations starting on the 25th of the seventh month [July]. 2. The epidemic prevention expenses are temporarily set at 3,000 yuan, and the county will refer to the 21st-year index of industrial and commercial groups to find ways to solicit donations. 3. The hospital site will be located at the Yanshou Temple in the East Gate or the Xiyongxian Temple in the West Gate. The District Chief will be responsible for contacting and deciding on the location, and Wei Zhiwen will be hired as the hospital director.</p>
<p>Privately Made Soy Sauce is Punished Separately</p>
<p>In recent years, some people in the county have been using seasonings and waste residue to manufacture new-style seasoned soy sauce in empty houses in Huiquan Mountain, Heng Hongkou, Beitang, and other places, selling them at low prices. The quality varies. The Sixth District Department of the Tax Police stationed in Wuxi believes that the private production of soy sauce violates the regulations and has conducted separate investigations and searches. The shop owners were detained, either temporarily held in custody, reported to superiors, or released on bail pending review. A total of three cases have been investigated. Currently, District Chief Ling has received instructions from his superiors to impose separate penalties.</p>
<p>Compilation of Tragic Suicides</p>
<p>Sun, the 17-year-old child bride of Chen Guihe, a resident of Chen Alley, Tuohua, near Bashi Bridge in the fifth district of the county; Xu, the 17-year-old child bride of Chen Hongquan; and Jinmei, the 16-year-old daughter of Chen Renquan, suddenly committed suicide by swallowing opium at the same time the day before yesterday. Upon discovery, doctors were immediately called to provide treatment. Sun and Xu were out of danger, but Chen Jinmei died due to excessive poisoning. The cause of their suicide was attributed to the pressure of life. Furthermore, Chen Wende, a rickshaw puller in the thatched shed under Huinong Bridge, also committed suicide by swallowing opium because he found it difficult to support his family. He was sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment and survived. In addition, Wang, the wife of Chen Daqing, a thatched hut resident of the 12th household in the 17th Jia of the 10th Bao, Xijing Town, next to the Green Willow Nunnery outside the East Gate, felt that she did not have enough to eat and had a quarrel with her husband. In a fit of anger, she hanged herself last night. The head of the 584th *Tu*, Ma Guiji, reported the incident to the court for an inquest.</p>

<p>Police Station Squad Leader Dies from Electric Shock</p>
<p>Sun Zhongyun, the squad leader of the third squad of the Public Security Bureau's Police Training Institute in Xu Gong Temple in the county seat, a native of Anhui, over thirty years old, was taking a walk with several police officers on the parade ground at around 6:00 PM on the 10th. Unexpectedly, the overhead electric wire on the parade ground, due to long-term damage, suddenly broke and fell on his shoulder. He was instantly electrocuted and fell to the ground. The police officers on the scene saw this and quickly turned off the electric light, attempting to rescue him, but to no avail. He died shortly thereafter. On the morning of the 11th, the Public Security Bureau reported this to the County Government. After County Magistrate Chen went to conduct an inquest, he ordered the Public Security Bureau to prepare a coffin and notify the family to come and claim the body.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Reassessment of Business Tax Has Concluded</p>
<p>The work of reassessing business taxes in various counties has concluded at the end of June. The Department of Finance is currently compiling statistics. However, some have not been reported, so the total number has not yet been determined. The Department previously, due to the provincial treasury's deficit, continued to mortgage 1.5 million yuan of this year's provincial business tax revenue to the Shanghai banking community, which has now been used. The first installment of repayment will begin this month.</p>
<p>A Branch of the Loan Office is Established in Suzhou and Changzhou</p>
<p>The Small Loan Office in Jiangsu Province has been operating for six months and has achieved remarkable results. Previously, Wu County, Jiangdu, Wujin, and other two counties sent letters requesting the establishment of branches. After Director Yuan and the counties discussed it many times, the principle was determined. The funds and expenses of Wu County would be raised by the county itself, and the head office would send personnel to provide guidance. The funds for Wujin were set at 100,000 yuan, which would be allocated by the head office, and the operating expenses would be raised by the county itself. The Jiangdu branch would be temporarily delayed because the Jin Cheng Jiangsu Farmers' Bank and the Third Bank had not set up branches in the county, making it more difficult to operate.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Hangzhou is Extremely Hot, and Coolies Suffer from Heatstroke</p>
<p>The weather in Hangzhou has recently entered a period of extreme heat. On the 11th, the indoor temperature reached 93 degrees, and it was even worse on the 12th, continuing to rise to 96 degrees. Several rickshaw pullers and coolies have collapsed and died from heatstroke on the road. Business is sluggish, but the sales of cold drinks have increased tenfold. Many people are crowding the lakeside to cool off in the evenings, and there are many people sleeping in the streets and alleys. The situation is returning to the extreme heat conditions of last year. The Provincial Government and its affiliated agencies have changed office hours starting on the 12th, from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily, with office hours suspended in the afternoon. Necessary and urgent matters will still be handled by the responsible personnel at any time.</p>
<p>The Monk Zhaokong is Ordered to Leave the Country</p>
<p>The international monk Zhaokong, along with his disciples Daojing, Daoda, Daoping, Daoming, and others, a total of eight people, went to Huading Temple on Tiantai Mountain two months ago to practice Zen. His German female disciple Daoda was confined by Zhaokong for a minor reason and committed suicide by hanging herself in anger. Furthermore, Daojing and Daoming had gone on a hunger strike due to unbearable abuse. The county authorities learned of this and ordered them to leave the country. They have already gone to Ningbo and boarded a ship to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Six People Die from Eating Wild Mushrooms</p>
<p>Abbot Alin of Longshan Temple in the *Xi* Mountain Township of Wukang County, along with monks Shouqing and Gengsheng, and workers Zhu Lili and the young monk Wen Kui of the Zhu family, a total of six people, had no rice to cook and had been hungry for several days. The day before yesterday, wild mushrooms grew after the rain, so they picked a basket and cooked them in the temple. They tasted very delicious. Unexpectedly, by midnight, everyone had severe abdominal pain. Realizing that something was wrong, they fed the remaining mushrooms to the chickens, which died soon after. The six people were terrified and each swallowed a large bowl of feces to detoxify, but it was still ineffective, and they died one after another. The county government has sent officials to conduct an inquest.</p>

<h3>Kong States Central Government Will Use 2 Million for Disaster Relief, Which Has Already Been Allocated by the National Treasury for Application, Kong Decheng, and Others Arrive in Shanghai Last Night for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, left Nanjing by night train the night before last night at 11:00 PM and arrived at the Shanghai North Station at 7:10 AM yesterday morning. He immediately returned to his private residence on West End Avenue to rest. Shortly after 9:00 AM, he met with Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chu Minyi and listened to a report on President Wang's illness, talking for about half an hour before parting. Song Ziwen, a member of the National Economic Council Standing Committee and Chairman of the Bank of China, visited at around 9:40 AM, spoke briefly, and then left. Kong then met with Zhang Gongquan, Vice President of the Central Bank, at around 10:00 AM, and discussed financial issues, talking for about 40 minutes before he left. Kong went to the Central Bank to work until noon. According to Kong, the floods in various places are a disaster. In addition to sending Qin Fen and Chuan Rulin to inspect, he has also telegraphed the relevant authorities in various places to make efforts to rescue and reinforce embankments and to seek rapid relief. The central government has decided to use 2 million yuan for disaster relief, which has long been included in the budget and has been allocated by the National Treasury for application. The National Economic Council has no plans to convene a standing committee meeting recently. He is responsible for all matters related to water conservancy. President Wang's illness has gradually recovered and will require a considerable amount of time to recover. Kong Decheng and other businessmen from Qufu are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by night train last night (12th) for sightseeing.</p>
<h3>Wang's Condition is Good, Chu Minyi and Liu Ruiheng Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Visit, Gu Mengyu and His Wife Also Went to the Hospital to Express Condolences</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chu Minyi and Health Department Director Liu Ruiheng left Nanjing by night train at 11:00 PM the night before last night and arrived at the North Station at 7:15 AM this morning.

<h3>Siam Still Values Chinese While Prohibiting Shanghai Newspapers and Singaporean Commerce Declines, Overseas Chinese Fall into Hardship</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, various organizations in this city are scheduled to hold the sixth executive meeting of the United Association for Aiding Overseas Chinese in Siam at its headquarters at 2 PM today to discuss the selection of representatives to travel south to Fujian, Guangdong, and Hong Kong to jointly implement the boycott of Siamese rice, as well as matters such as funding and the publication of external propaganda materials. A concrete plan for organizing an inspection tour to Siam will also be discussed at today's meeting. It is learned that the association received two reports yesterday: one stating that the Siamese government has banned the import of newspapers from this city, and the other stating that the number of unemployed overseas Chinese in Singapore is increasing daily. The details of these reports are as follows:</p>
<p>Siam Bans Import of Newspapers from This City</p>
<p>Since the anti-Chinese incident in Siam, people in the country have been filled with righteous indignation and have jointly condemned it. The Siamese Ministry of Interior recently ordered a ban on the import of the Hong Kong Da Guang Bao because it heavily criticized the illegal actions of the Siamese government and extensively reported on the suffering of the overseas Chinese in an effort to awaken the people of the country. Not satisfied with this, it has now banned the import of newspapers from this city. According to a statement from the Siamese Propaganda Bureau, the Siamese Ministry of Interior has suddenly issued a proclamation stating that Chinese newspapers in Shanghai have expressed opinions hostile to the Siamese government and are prohibited from import. Currently, all Chinese newspapers are being detained and confiscated.</p>
<p>Increasing Number of Unemployed Overseas Chinese in Singapore</p>
<p>The association also received a report from overseas Chinese in Singapore stating that (the beginning is omitted) due to the recent global economic downturn and the impending bankruptcy of rural areas, compatriots are abandoning their homeland and flocking to Singapore in search of work to make a living. However, Singapore's commerce has remained extremely sluggish in recent years, and the number of unemployed people is increasing daily. Therefore, compatriots who arrive in port have no work to do and become destitute, which is truly pitiful. However, the compatriots who travel thousands of miles to work do so because the domestic industry and commerce are declining, making it difficult to find food and shelter, so they take the risk. Currently, the "water passengers" (those who arrange passage) on the ships profit from each passenger who boards the ship, and they will inevitably offer sweet words to induce people to raise the travel fare and go to Southeast Asia. After arriving, those who are fortunate enough to have relatives and friends doing business there can find ways to survive. However, those who have no relatives and rely solely on finding work in the air will either become beggars or die in a foreign land. Furthermore, women who are not careful may be deceived by the water passengers, thinking that they will immediately find work upon arrival in Singapore. However, after arriving in port, even if they find work, they can only stay in hostels, or several people share a room. When their funds are exhausted, they are often seduced by pimps to become prostitutes. The misery of their downfall is difficult to describe in detail. A special message is sent to all male and female compatriots planning to go to Singapore, advising them to be cautious and prudent beforehand.</p>

<h3>Cruiser Haishen and Haiqi Pass Shanghai Yesterday Morning on Way to Nanjing to Rejoin the Fleet Return to Shanghai in a Week for Major Overhaul</h3>
<p>The cruisers Haiqi and Haishen left Guangzhou on the 15th of last month and stopped in the waters of Cheung Chau, Hong Kong, requesting to return to the central government. The Ministry of the Navy sent Vice-Minister Chen Jiliang to negotiate. After Chen returned, Chen Ce, Chief of the Military Affairs Department, was sent to lead them back north. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency has learned the details from the headquarters of the Navy at Gaochang Temple, as follows:</p>
<p>Passed Wusong Yesterday Morning and Headed to Nanjing</p>
<p>The cruisers Haiqi and Haishen, led by Chen Ce, left Hong Kong on the 9th and passed Wusong at about 6 AM yesterday, heading directly to Nanjing. The naval circles in this city did not send personnel to contact the two ships because they had not received a telegram in advance. When the two ships passed Wusong, only the Hai Chou and Hai Rong were docked on the Wusong River, communicating with each other by flag signals.</p>
<p>To Return to Shanghai for Major Overhaul Next Week</p>
<p>It is heard that the Haiqi and Haishen will return to Shanghai to rejoin the fleet in Nanjing and will come to Jiangnan Shipyard for a major overhaul in about a week.

<p>According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, the Haiqi and Haishen have been commanded by Jiang Xiyuan and have been sailing south after departing from the Beiyang Fleet for two years. In these two years, they have not been overhauled due to the lack of suitable docks in Guangdong. When they left Guangdong this time, they also passed through the Battle of Humen Bay, and the ships were quite damaged. The internal gun positions also need to be re-examined, and the ships need to be repainted.</p>

However, due to the complexity of the accounts of the Beiping General Office, it was not easy to count them. In addition to the Central Bank headquarters telexing the Beiping Central Branch to send personnel nearby to handle the matter, Wang Yixian, the commissioner who took over the Shanghai branch, was sent to Beiping to assist in the process to complete it as soon as possible. The Shanghai branch and the branches in Hankou, Kaifeng, and other places have submitted a brief report on the assets and liabilities of the society. In the future, after the General Office has completed the takeover and all the accounts have been centralized, the Central Bank will combine the totals and prepare a general report to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for verification and record. Then, collection and remittance will be resumed simultaneously in various places, and the Trust Bureau will handle them as usual. It is heard that the method will not be changed, but it will not be for the purpose of making profits, but to provide considerable benefits to depositors.</p>
<h3>Foreign Hydraulic Engineering Expert Discusses Fundamental Ways to Prevent Floods Should Open Tributaries and Dredge Waterways</h3>
<p>In the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Yellow River, floods have erupted recently, and the water is surging. Several places have broken through the embankments, causing huge disasters. The government authorities are paying close attention to this and have sent personnel to inspect various sections and urge the hydraulic engineering agencies in various sections to strictly prevent and rescue. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited a foreign hydraulic engineering expert to ask about the fundamental ways to prevent floods on the Yangtze River and Yellow River. According to him, the Yellow River flood is more serious than the Yangtze River, but the water level of the Yangtze River has also been increasing year by year in recent years, and small and large floods have occurred frequently. The fundamental way to prevent floods is definitely not to increase the height of the embankments. This spring, the hydraulic engineering experts from the International League of Nations, Nie Yufu and others, came to China to inspect and believed that increasing the height of the embankments on both sides to prevent water overflow was not a good idea. If the embankments are constantly raised, the severity of the disaster once the water collapses is self-evident. The height of the Yellow River embankment exceeds the city walls in several places, so the water that collapses and flows horizontally is extremely devastating, and the disaster area is wide. Because the embankment is too high, it is difficult for the collapsed water to recede in a short time. Therefore, to prevent floods, attention should be paid to hydraulic engineering. In the past, foreign hydraulic engineering experts came to China to inspect water conservancy and advocated raising huge sums of money to purchase hydraulic engineering equipment to carry out the project. At a time when China's domestic social economy is panicking, how can huge sums of money be raised to purchase this hydraulic engineering equipment? I believe that the method of raising funds to purchase equipment for water control is not suitable for the present China, and I believe that China's hoes and ploughs and other agricultural tools can be used as good equipment for water control. Although the effectiveness of hoes and ploughs is not as sharp as that of equipment, if proper guidance can be given, I believe that the macro effect will not be greatly inferior to that of equipment. Moreover, there are many barren banks on both sides of the Yellow River (less on both sides of the Yangtze River), which is caused by the lack of tributaries on both sides and the difficulty of irrigation. If the authorities of the Chinese provinces can supervise the industrious and world-renowned Chinese people to use their omnipotent agricultural tools such as hoes and ploughs to open tributaries on both sides of the river, while the hydraulic engineering agencies abandon the work of increasing the height of the embankments and focus on dredging the waterways, then floods can be avoided and the river water can be diverted to irrigate the fields, achieving multiple benefits. The hydraulic engineering expert also said that he believes that the above opinions are sufficient for the Chinese hydraulic engineering authorities to study.</p>
<h3>Talent for Loan Management Loan Implementation Procedures Held Fifth Standing Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the fifth meeting of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee was held at 4 PM yesterday in the conference room of the China National Goods Bank to discuss the method of undertaking investigation expenses and to review the format of the loan application forms. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon. Cai Zengji, Chen Guangfu, Bei Songsun, Zhang Peishen, Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, (Qin Dai), Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaoji, Du Yuesheng, and others attended. Song Ziliang and Wu Xingya were absent. Cai Zengji chaired the meeting as usual and read out the previous proposal. Then the chairman and various committee members reported on: (1) the proposal to have the applicants bear the investigation expenses of the committee, in accordance with banking regulations; (Resolution) Passed; (2) the proposal to send investigation cases related to banks that cannot send personnel to assist in the investigation to be investigated; (Resolution) Passed; (3) how should the 15 million yuan mortgage loan be handled; (Resolution) Please submit a clear list of the banks and money shops that are responsible and the amount they are responsible for to the Ministry of Finance for review so that it can be carried out; (4) how many copies of the loan application form and various investigation forms should be printed for future use; (Resolution) Passed; Review of the loan application form and various form formats; (Resolution) Passed; (6) Review of the format of the national treasury voucher; (Resolution) Passed.</p>
<p>Loan Procedures</p>
<p>As for the 5 million yuan small credit loans, each bank and money shop had already assumed responsibility for them. A few days ago, the Ministry of Finance also ordered the two industries to inform the various banks and shops to remit the recognized amount to the National Goods Bank. According to Cai Zengji, the chairman of the committee, the funds for this borrowing have not yet been remitted. For the sake of simplifying the procedures, a letter will be sent to the banks and money shops to send a detailed list of the amount assumed by each bank and shop, and the funds will be stored separately by each bank and shop. When the loan is started in the future, the committee will notify the banks and shops to pay.</p>

<h3>The Public Safety Bureau Adheres to the New Household Registration Law and Implements a City-Wide Household Census</h3>
<p>A Temporary Budget of 15,000 Yuan is Approved; Relevant Departments are Instructed to Incorporate German Methods in Drafting a Plan</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the household census in this city, the various district offices of the Public Safety Bureau have diligently carried out the census, which has been very effective in maintaining local security. Now, the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, in accordance with the new household registration law promulgated by the central government, has decided to conduct another household census, with a temporary budget of 15,000 yuan. The relevant departments have been instructed to draft an implementation plan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Re-Implementation of the Census</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Su Luping, the chief secretary of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, told a reporter from the Dagong News Agency that the bureau is responsible for public safety and will strive to promote and improve police administration. The city-wide household census, which began several years ago, has been quite effective in maintaining local order. Now, in order to eliminate bandits and ensure that people can live and work in peace, the central government has promulgated a new household registration law to be implemented nationwide. As Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, with a mix of good and bad elements, police administration and security are particularly important compared to other cities. Therefore, it has been decided to conduct another city-wide household census in accordance with the new household registration law, with a temporary budget of 15,000 yuan. Once approved by the municipal government, it can be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Advantages of the New Law</p>
<p>The current household registration in this city is limited to changes in residents' addresses, the number of family members and friends of shop owners and residents moving in and out, and the investigation of marriages and funerals. However, the new household registration law includes the following in addition to the above: (1) Every citizen in the area, regardless of age or gender, will be issued a name card with their name, origin, age, occupation, address, and the number of family members or shop employees. Landlords and tenants in the place of residence must fulfill three joint guarantee obligations. (2) The police in each district must be familiar with the total population of the district, as well as the occupation and address of each citizen or shop. At the same time, they should be able to know the number of citizens moving in and out each day. These are the important points of the new law. The entire text is extremely complex, so the district police will receive special training. The plan to implement the household census has been instructed to the Household Registration Section of the Second Division to draft in detail. According to Secretary Su, although the new household registration law has complete articles, there are still some differences compared to the Berlin household census law in Germany. In recent years, Germany has attached great importance to household registration, and its methods are excellent, making it a world leader. The procedures are simple and appropriate, and citizens do not find it troublesome. Therefore, in addition to implementing the new law, this bureau will also refer to the methods of that country for reference. The Capital Police Department is already imitating and implementing them.</p>

<p>After the General Sale of Refined Salt, the Salt Administration is Requested to Increase Sales Quotas in Order to Balance Production and Sales and Maintain Operations, Leading to Fierce Opposition from Coarse Salt Merchants</p>
<p>The Industrial Society said that the issue of general sales of refined salt has long been approved by the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance in terms of production and sales quotas. Coarse salt merchants are now fiercely opposed. The refined salt industry plans to ask the Salt Administration to increase sales quotas to provide relief. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Salt Administration Approved Production and Sales Quotas</p>
<p>The invention of refined salt in China began in the third year of the Republic of China. There are six major manufacturing companies nationwide, including Jiuda, Tongyi, Yongyu Tongda, Wuhe, and Minsheng, with a total of more than 12,000 employees. Initially, they could only sell to treaty ports, and sales only reached 31% of production, resulting in supply exceeding demand and difficulty in maintaining operations. Last year, representatives were repeatedly sent to Beijing to petition, and the Salt Administration approved relief, allowing them to sell to the five ports of Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu from January 1 this year, and to resell to the inland areas of various provinces. The production quota was set at 2.24 million dan (a unit of weight), and sales were set at 1.3 million dan.</p>
<p>Fierce Opposition from Coarse Salt Merchants</p>
<p>Most of the coastal areas of China are salt-producing areas, but the salt produced is all coarse salt. When refined salt was invented, it only sold to treaty ports, so it did not have much impact on the sales of coarse salt. Since the Salt Administration approved the general sale of refined salt to the inland areas last year, the business of coarse salt merchants has been severely hit. They have repeatedly petitioned the Salt Administration to withdraw its decision without success. Now, the refined salt companies are actively setting up distribution points in the inland areas of various provinces in order to sell the approved quota and provide relief to their businesses, which has once again aroused fierce opposition from the coarse salt merchants, who are requesting the Salt Administration to reduce the sales volume of refined salt. It is said that they are actively pursuing this.</p>
<p>The Refined Salt Industry Plans to Request an Increase in Sales Quotas</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter interviewed Zhang Yuejun of the Refined Salt Industry Association, who said that it was a last resort for the industry to request the Salt Administration to approve production and sales quotas. Last year, they petitioned in Beijing, and the Administration, considering the difficulties of the merchants, immediately approved the sales quota. However, at that time, the inland areas of various ports were not yet accessible for sales, so only 900,000 dan were sold last year. The Administration approved the supplementary sale and included it in this year's sales volume. Unexpectedly, the coarse salt merchants did not understand and instead opposed the Administration's approved annual sales quota of 1.3 million dan. The Association divided the quota among the six major companies, and each company had only a few sales. If things continue to this extreme, the future of the industry is difficult to be optimistic about. Sales in the first half of this year were only over 700,000 to 800,000 dan, and the remaining amount can definitely be sold by the end of the year. Currently, in order to balance production and sales, the industry has decided to request the Salt Administration to increase the sales quota again in order to maintain operations.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education Instructs the Chamber of Commerce that Restrictions on the Dissolution of Trade Associations Require Members and Non-Members to Fulfill Their Obligations</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters instructed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that, in order to comply with the matter, according to the report of the Refined Practice Industry Trade Association, it was found that among the eight member companies of the association, three owed membership fees, and the remaining five were unwilling to pay on time. In the current economic downturn, members have disagreements due to business competition, and there is little sincerity in unity within the association. Some even think of avoiding the payment of membership fees and express that they do not need the existence of the association. Their lack of understanding of the meaning of collaboration and the spirit of mutual assistance is truly regrettable. Not only does this phenomenon exist in this association, but it is also common in other public organizations. It is believed that only the superior authorities with the highest authority can have remedial measures. It is requested that all legally registered public organizations be ordered not to have the freedom to dissolve at will, and those with loose organizations must also be reorganized. All members of the organization, whether members or non-members, should fulfill their obligations to pay membership fees, so that the organization can exist, and the development of social undertakings and the facilities for the welfare of the people will be of great benefit. It is hoped that you will approve this request. According to this, the procedures for the dissolution of a trade association have been stipulated in Article 15 of the Implementation Rules of the Trade Association Law. The dissolution and liquidation of an association shall be subject to the provisions of the Chamber of Commerce Law. Moreover, Article 32 of Chapter 7 of the Chamber of Commerce Law states that the dissolution of a chamber of commerce requires the attendance of more than three-quarters of the member representatives and the consent of more than two-thirds of the attending representatives before a resolution can be made. The resolution in the preceding paragraph shall not take effect without the approval of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Therefore, it has long been clearly stipulated by laws and regulations that an association cannot be dissolved arbitrarily. As for the fact that both members and non-members must abide by the articles of association and fulfill the obligations of members, the Ministry of Industry has already instructed the association to comply with it. Those who have not paid their membership fees in accordance with the regulations have also been notified by the Judicial Yuan that the trade association can, in the name of a legal person, follow the ordinary procedures of civil litigation or the procedure for expediting payment to recover the debts. In addition to the reply, it is urgently ordered that the association forward this order to all its affiliated industry associations, comply with the above-mentioned laws and regulations, and not violate them.</p>
<p>The Central Bank Establishes Issuing Branches; Interview with Li Zhilian, Director of the Issuing Bureau</p>
<p>Li Zhilian, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the bank's establishment of issuing branches, divided into the Southwest, Northwest, and Central China regions according to domestic conditions, was proposed by President Kong and submitted to the National Government for record. Issuing bureaus will be established in order of necessity, depending on the actual situation. The organizational law originally had provisions for setting up branches as needed. In the past, nationwide issuance was managed by the head office, which appointed issuing commissioners to reside in the locations of branch banks to be responsible for issuance matters. Now, due to the difficult transportation in Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places, it has been decided to establish an issuing branch in Chongqing. Wang Shixie, the issuing commissioner in that area, has been appointed to preside over the preparatory work. After President Kong appoints a director, the branch will be established immediately. The banknotes issued will circulate in the southwestern provinces, but there will be no geographical distinction, as the banknotes of the Central Bank are always valid throughout the country.</p>

<h3>Due to the Hot Weather, the Central Mint Will Suspend Work for One Month</h3>

It is expected that coining can resume around August 1.</p>
<h3>Hengfeng Yarn Factory Temporarily Suspends Work from Yesterday</h3>
<p>Work Will Resume After the Weather Cools; The Amount of Yarn Stocked in This City Has Increased Sharply</p>
<p>China's yarn industry has been affected by high cotton prices and low yarn prices, coupled with dwindling sales, and its business is extremely sluggish. Yarn factories across the country have generally reduced work to maintain the status quo. Yesterday, the Hengfeng Yarn Factory, founded by Nie Lushi, a major figure in the yarn industry in this city, also suspended work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hengfeng Yarn Factory Suspends Work for Two Months</p>
<p>The Hengfeng Yarn Factory on Huasheng Road in Pudong, this city, was founded by Nie Lushi, a major figure in the yarn industry. It employs two or three thousand workers and has been painstakingly managed for many years. In recent years, due to the economic downturn, sales have dwindled, and because of the impact of high yarn prices and low cotton prices, the cost has increased, and each package needs to lose two to four yuan. Under this status quo, it is impossible to maintain operations, so it has been decided to temporarily suspend work for two months from yesterday. All workers will be given travel expenses and temporarily dismissed, and spinning will resume when the weather cools in the autumn.</p>
<p>More Than 100,000 Packages of Yarn are Stocked in This City</p>
<p>According to people in the yarn industry who spoke to a reporter from the Dagong News Agency, the amount of yarn stocked in this city has recently been affected by foreign yarn, and the selling price is between 30 and 40 yuan. Although the price is low, the market demand is very low, and sales are still very limited. Therefore, the future of the yarn industry is very bleak.</p>

<h3>The Lake Society Pays Attention to Improving Agriculture</h3>
<p>The six counties under the jurisdiction of Lake are a wealthy area in western Zhejiang. The soil is fertile, the climate is mild, and agriculture has always been well-developed, especially sericulture, which is famous in the world. In the year when silkworms failed, agriculture and sericulture were in distress, and frequent water shortages made it difficult for people to live. The Lake Society in this city, in view of this, has taken measures to improve agriculture in order to restore the rural economy and enrich the people's food. Now, Mr. Chen Guofu, a member of the society, proposed five measures for improvement: (1) If sericulture fails in Huzhou, what kind of side business should be changed to? (2) Can mulberry land be planted more, or can fruit trees also be planted? (3) Can other miscellaneous grains be planted in mulberry land? (4) If sericulture is not practiced during the sericulture season, can an early rice crop be added, or can other aquatic products of high value be raised? (5) Are there any other remedial measures? Chairman Shen Tianxin of the executive committee of the society convened a meeting of the standing committees to discuss it, and then it was decided to send a letter to Zhang Zishan and other agricultural experts from the Lake region to prepare a plan, investigate the faculty and students of the agricultural sciences of various universities who are from the Lake region, and invite them to discuss the measures. Once talents are recruited and measures are sought, an agricultural improvement association will be organized to actively carry out the measures. Those from the Lake region who have agricultural knowledge or experience are especially welcome to prepare improvement opinions and implementation methods and send them to the society for reference.</p>

<h3>The French National Day; The Military Parade Ceremony Was Cancelled</h3>

<p>The French Concession authorities, in preparation for the country's National Day, had scheduled a military parade ceremony at the Sports Ground on Rafeide Road on the morning of the 14th, with the participation of the French garrison in Shanghai, the marine corps, the police and the volunteer corps.

<h3>The China Economic Society Will Hold Its Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Guangzhou Starting From August 28</p>
<p>The China Economic Society is one of the most famous academic research groups in China. Every year, it holds an annual meeting in major ports to gather its members, discuss together, and facilitate sightseeing. Now it is learned that this year's 12th annual meeting has been scheduled to be held in Guangzhou from August 11 to 31. In addition to the annual meeting preparatory committee holding several meetings to actively carry out the preparations, it is also heard that it has received welcome letters from all walks of life in Guangzhou, preparing to entertain the members. The scope of this year's papers has been set as "China's Economic Policy That Should Be Adopted in the Future." Since the members of the society are mostly domestic economists, discussing such an important issue should be able to express expert opinions and benefit the country. The grand occasion at that time can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Fire Department Main Office Moves to Original Site of Central Police Station</h3>
<p>The Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently suggested to the Board of Directors that the old Central Police Station site between Honan Road and Foochow Road, which had previously been decided to be demolished, should have the northern section of the building, which was built later, repaired and used. Therefore, it was proposed to move the Fire Department's main office there and convert the old Health Department building into residences for married staff and their families. This proposal has already been approved by the Board of Directors. Furthermore, according to the estimate of the Director of Public Works, repairing the former Vehicle Department building at the old Central Police Station site would cost approximately 8,000 yuan. However, the existing fire brigade building rental would save approximately 6,000 yuan per year. The repair cost of the old Health Department building would be approximately 13,000 yuan, but it is estimated to save approximately 5,000 yuan over three years.</p>
<h3>Minimal Loss of Cotton Production in Henan and Shandong Despite Yellow River Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>Cotton Control Association Receives Report Yesterday</p>
<p>The Industrial Society stated that the Cotton Control Association, in order to increase cotton production and achieve self-sufficiency, has devoted its full efforts in recent years to promoting cotton planting. Significant results were achieved last year, and this year, a large number of American cotton seeds were distributed to Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces, hoping to obtain good results. During the sowing season this year, it was affected by a prolonged drought, but it gradually recovered after receiving timely rainfall. Recently, due to the high Yellow River flood, dikes in various places within Henan and Shandong suddenly collapsed. The association was concerned that cotton production would be affected and paid close attention to the matter. A telegram was sent to the cotton production improvement institutes in the respective provinces to inquire about the situation. News was received yesterday stating that there was not much cotton planted in the disaster-stricken areas, and the losses were minimal. The main cotton-growing areas have not been affected yet, and the situation is very good. Therefore, the future prospects are not hindered.</p>

<h3>German Ph.D. Arrives in Shanghai: Desires to Understand a Country's Customs by Traveling in Steerage - One Must Observe from the Common People</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Bao reports that Dr. Hülsmann, a German Ph.D., arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 11th) from Yokohama on a Japanese cargo ship in third class. It is said that the fare was only 14 yen. According to the doctor, his choice to travel in third class was not entirely for the sake of saving money. Saving money is a good thing these days, but he has an even greater purpose in mind. To understand a country's customs, one cannot observe from the actions of its leaders alone; one must observe from the common people. Therefore, one must live and work with them to obtain the truth. This is why he travels among the common people. The doctor has been away from his country for over a year. Although he is in his twenties or thirties, his face is full of contemplation. He walked from Kobe to Yokohama, interacting with the common people and lodging wherever he could find a place for the night. His expenses were limited to what was necessary for a laborer's life. Before arriving in Japan, the doctor traveled in India and South China, where his daily food was similar to that of laborers. The doctor said that he sometimes found it difficult to swallow, but he persevered because he believed that the issue of food is related to the way of life of the people and is a most serious problem. He felt that he could not deeply understand this way without experiencing it himself. The doctor obtained a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Hamburg in 1931 and is also an anthropologist. However, he focuses on the current lives of the people, with their origins and ancient development being secondary. The doctor's trip to the Far East is for this reason. The doctor believes that to study human customs, one should start with one's own country and its neighbors. It is foolish to seek what is distant without understanding what is near. Therefore, before going to the Far East, the doctor spent a long time studying the various peoples of Europe. The doctor does not want to stay in Shanghai for long because of the hot weather and because Shanghai is too internationalized to be worthwhile for a long-term study. To understand the people's feelings, one must seek them in the interior. There is no other way. The doctor has not yet decided whether to go to North China and the provinces or return to his country in a few days. When he returns to Europe in the future, he plans to travel in steerage or the cheapest class. After returning to his country, he plans to write a book based on what he has seen along the way.</p>
<h3>This Year's Scorching Heat - Yesterday Was the First Day: 98.1 Degrees</h3>
<p>The climate in Shanghai this year was cool like autumn in early summer. However, in the past few days, it suddenly turned hot. The heat had already broken this year's record the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, yesterday was even hotter. By noon, the temperature had already exceeded 90 degrees. According to the report from the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, the highest temperature reached 98.1 degrees, and the lowest was 79.6 degrees. It can be said that yesterday was the first day of scorching heat since the beginning of summer this year.</p>
<h3>Telephone Company Overcharges for Calls - Taxpayers' Association Requests Correction</h3>
<p>Issue a method to prove actual usage in the next bill</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the International Settlement sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Sir, according to numerous telephone subscribers, 'The Shanghai Telephone Company's bills for calls to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications often do not match the actual facts. Those who have never called a Shanghai Telephone Bureau subscriber are also charged for these calls. Those who have made calls are often charged for more than the actual number of calls. A correction should be requested.' This association has repeatedly written to your bureau, requesting that the Shanghai Telephone Company be ordered to make corrections, but the company has not provided satisfactory responses, which is regrettable. This association now requests that your bureau order the company to record the following facts on the call bills to avoid ambiguity and trickery: (1) date, (2) time, (3) the number of the telephone called, (4) whether the call went through or not, (5) duration of the call. If these details are clearly recorded, it will allow subscribers to understand where the error is and easily investigate whether they have dealings with or are familiar with the subscriber of that number. If there is no such clear record, how can the actual number of calls used be calculated? It would be best to order the company to immediately implement a method: (1) separately record any declaration of not using this type of call, and (2) instruct that if there is a telephone number that is instructed to connect the number of a Shanghai Telephone Bureau subscriber, do not make the transfer.' This association believes that this is the responsibility of the Shanghai Telephone Company and that the lack of equipment should not be used as a reason for resistance. The cost of these calls should only be charged to those who actually use them. Correspondingly, we repeatedly request your bureau to promptly order the company to handle this matter and faithfully implement it on the next bill." This is addressed to the Acting Secretary-General Fei of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Telephone Price Increase in Areas Beyond the Settlement Roads Still Has Issues - Municipal Government Has Not Granted Permission and is Now Attempting to Correct</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's increase in telephone prices, because the sovereignty of the areas beyond the settlement roads in western and northern Shanghai belongs to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has sent a letter to the company stating that if the company wants to increase the price of telephones installed in these areas, it must first obtain permission from the Municipal Government; otherwise, the price of telephones in these areas must not be increased. The details have been reported in various newspapers. Considering the importance of this matter, reporters inquired with relevant parties and learned that the Shanghai Telephone Company stated that the telephone price increase was based on the contract signed between the company and the two concession municipal councils, and they did not agree to comply with the requirement to first obtain permission from the Shanghai Municipal Government. Yesterday, we again rushed to inquire at the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, and we were informed that the Shanghai Telephone Company had previously signed a temporary telephone contract with the Bureau of Public Utilities and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications for the installation and repair of telephones in the areas beyond the settlement roads in western and northern Shanghai. It is undoubtedly clear that the right for the company to operate in these areas belongs to the Municipal Government. Regarding the issue of telephone price increases in these areas, it is inappropriate for the company not to request permission from the Municipal Government. We are currently continuing to correct this. As for the contract signed between the company and the two concession municipal councils, it is clear that it cannot be applied to the areas beyond the settlement roads where sovereignty belongs to the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Homicide Case of Gatekeepers in Fuxuli, Tianjin Road - Two Gatekeepers, Known to Be Close, Suddenly Argued Last Night and Fired Shots - Sun Falian Died, Wang Tongchun Surrendered</h3>
<p>Sun Falian, a 35-year-old from Shandong, was Gatekeeper No. 1589 at Qingcheng Qianzhuang, No. 10, Fuxuli, Lane 170, Tianjin Road. He had previously served as a platoon leader in the military but retired and became a Chinese constable in the Public Concession due to misfortune and frustration. He was assigned to his current position by the police at the request of the Qianye Guild. He was usually quite amiable. Wang Tongchun, a 38-year-old from Haizhou, was Gatekeeper No. 35 at Hengjiu Qianzhuang, No. 16, in the same lane. They saw each other every day and belonged to the same profession, so they were very close. At around 10:40 last night, Wang was on duty, guarding the entrance of the lane, when Sun suddenly returned from outside. After they greeted each other as usual, they began to chat. Unexpectedly, after only a few words, the two began to argue. Wang Tongchun pulled out his service handgun and fired four shots at Sun Falian. Sun was caught off guard and was shot in the head. He fell to the ground and died. Although there were other people sitting and relaxing in the lane at the time, they were afraid of being harmed and did not dare to step forward. However, Wang did not flee the scene but walked to the Central Police Station to surrender. He was immediately detained. A rescue vehicle was dispatched to the scene to take Sun to Renji Hospital, where he was examined and the gunshot wound was confirmed. The body was then transferred to the autopsy office. The assailant Wang also had injuries on his right hand, which were bandaged at the hospital before he was taken back to the police station to await trial. However, he refused to reveal the reason for the murder. According to other gatekeepers in the lane, it was likely due to money, as the two had frequent financial transactions.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Great China Tragedy Unresolved - Thousands of Women Negotiated Yesterday, Armed with Chamber Pots, Scrubbing Brushes, and Door Bolts - Clashes Erupted with Detectives</h3>
<p>The Great China Celluloid Factory at No. 100, Lane 137, Yichang Road, Xiaoshadu Road, suffered a fire on the evening of the 28th of last month, injuring nearby poor people, some of whom died from their injuries. The families of the victims have repeatedly formed groups to demand compensation and arrangements for the aftermath from the factory, but the Great China Factory has not made any concrete expressions, leading to frequent negotiations between the poor people and the factory. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 yesterday morning, about a thousand women from Chongming and Jiangbei gathered in front of the factory and surrounded it, demanding direct negotiations with the factory regarding the aftermath. The women were armed with chamber pots, scrubbing brushes, door bolts, and other items, and their voices were so loud that they could not be stopped. They rushed into the factory, barging into the factory's offices and the second and third workshops. Without asking for reasons, they smashed the equipment and windows. The factory staff fled in panic, fearing other unexpected events. They urgently called the Putuo Road Police Station for assistance. After receiving the news, the police dispatched more than ten detectives to suppress the situation. However, the women were extremely unruly and attacked the detectives with scrubbing brushes. The detectives fought back, but they were outnumbered and unable to stop them. Two western constables, No. 117, and Chinese constable Liu Yonggui were injured. The detectives called the police station again, requesting the dispatch of the Shanghai East Reserve Brigade in armored vehicles. They managed to subdue and disperse the women. All those injured on both sides during the dispute were taken to the hospital. As they only suffered minor injuries, they were discharged after being bandaged. The chaos subsided by noon. The police are not only dispatching armed detectives to guard the factory but also believe that someone may be manipulating and instigating the situation, so they are investigating.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Manufacturing Den Broken Up at Mingdeli, Fuxu Road - Boss and Manufacturer at Large, Court Reschedules Interrogation for the 26th</h3>
<p>It was reported that someone was secretly and privately manufacturing red pills at No. 33 Mingdeli, Fuxu Road, French Concession. On the morning of the 11th, police detectives Li Liansheng, Zhou Ruzhang, and Chen Yishan went to the address to search and arrested a shop assistant named Zhang Aqing (26 years old, from Ningbo). The boss and the manufacturing workers had already fled after hearing the news. More than 3,000 red pills, 2,000 sheets of Dragon and Tiger brand trademark paper, raw materials, medicinal powders, saccharin, and manufacturing equipment were seized, along with six double-bottomed briefcases used for delivery. Zhang was taken back to the police station along with the evidence. A detective was assigned to guard the organ and arrest the remaining gang members. It was learned that the organ was rented by Qiao Jinlin, a Ningbo native with old connections, and had moved into the house less than a month ago. Therefore, the electricity had not yet been installed, and candles were burned every night to avoid attention. Deliveries were also made at night. The matter was discovered by the security guard of the lane, who often saw people carrying briefcases in and out of the house, looking flustered, which aroused suspicion. The guard reported the information to the rental agency, who secretly sent someone to check the house and found that both upstairs and downstairs were red pill manufacturing workshops. The security guard was then ordered to report to the police, who dispatched detectives to search and arrest. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Zhang to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special District Court. At noon, Judge Wang Gangxu interrogated him. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Affairs Department, presented the case and stated that the main suspects were at large and had not been apprehended. He requested a longer period to allow the police to arrest the accomplices and the main suspects to investigate the case before filing a lawsuit. He requested that the defendant be temporarily detained. Detective Chen Yishan reported on the process of solving the case. Zhang Aqing confessed that he had previously worked as a salesman in a sock factory. The house at No. 33 Mingdeli was rented by the boss, Qiao Jinlin, and Liu Bingsheng introduced him to take care of the house. It had been less than a month, and the boss had gone to the countryside to pick up his family to come to Shanghai. He did not know about the red pill manufacturing. After verifying the confessions, the court decided to reschedule the interrogation for the morning of the 26th, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Yao Fuzeng Sues to Confirm He is an Illegitimate Child - Claims He Was Born to Yao Shenqing, Therefore Sues Yao's Wife and Her Sons - Judge Advises Them to Settle Out of Court</h3>
<p>Yao Fuzeng, a 26-year-old from Wuxing, residing at No. 22 Xiudexincun, Chengdu Road, recently hired lawyer Huang Shaochang to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court against Yao Sunshi, the wife of the deceased Anli Foreign Firm comprador Yao Shenqing, and her sons Yao Boxiong and Yao Yanqing, requesting confirmation that he is Shenqing's illegitimate son. The reasons for the lawsuit are as follows: The plaintiff's mother, Wang Asi, was originally a servant in a brothel. She had a cohabiting relationship with Yao Shenqing, and when the plaintiff was born on September 15th of the Xuantong period, the defendant Yao Sunshi had no sons, only one daughter. Therefore, she treated the plaintiff as her own son. Later, Sunshi continued to have sons Boxiong, Yanqing, Zimin, Yingjun, and Zhijie. On September 12th of the Republic of China year 20, Shenqing suddenly forced the plaintiff to sign a blank document and gave him 2,400 yuan. At first, he did not know what kind of document it was, but later he learned that it was a termination of adoption agreement. Now that Shenqing has passed away, in order to restore his identity, he is filing this lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Peng Shi of the First Special District Court opened the Civil Court 4 and summoned the defendants, but they did not appear. Lawyer Cai Lucheng defended them, first stating that the plaintiff Yao Fuzeng claimed, "I am the biological son of Shenqing. My biological mother, Wang Asi, her current situation is unknown. In the Republic of China year 20, I was forced to sign a document. When I signed it, it was a blank paper, and later I learned that it was a separation agreement. At that time, I was given 2,400 yuan, but I actually only received 800 yuan, and the rest was embezzled by others. Recently, I have repeatedly gone to the defendants' house, but I have been driven out. The purpose of filing this lawsuit is to restore my identity." Lawyer Cai immediately stood up and argued, stating, "The defendant Yao Sunshi hired a wet nurse named Jin Ma from Changshu after giving birth to Boxiong because she did not have enough milk. The plaintiff Yao Fuzeng was the son of Jin Ma and was brought along. In the Republic of China year 3, Jin Ma returned to her hometown due to illness. Because she was poor and unable to raise him, the plaintiff asked Yao Shenqing to adopt him. Yao, driven by compassion, recognized him as his adopted son, and Jin died in her hometown soon after. In the Republic of China year 20, because the plaintiff wanted to marry into the Tang Jianyang family, Zhou Chao explained to Yao Shenqing that he wanted to terminate the adoption relationship. After discussion, the agreement was drawn up at this law firm, and the plaintiff also changed his name to Tang Jinfeng. Yao paid the plaintiff a bank draft for 2,400 yuan at that time. Because he needed cash, the adoptive father and son went to cash it together. The plaintiff's claim of being forced to sign is completely false." He presented the separation agreement and the marriage agreement to the court. The plaintiff's lawyer then submitted a list of witnesses, all of whom were relatives of Yao. The court believed that settlement was the best outcome for this case and advised them to settle out of court. The hearing was rescheduled, and if a settlement could not be reached, the trial would proceed.</p>
<h3>Various Tobacco and Alcohol Trade Associations Petition to be Exempted from Filling Out Business Status Forms</h3>
<p>Various trade associations in this city, including tobacco exchange, soy sauce and alcohol, soy sauce gardens, wine and restaurant, Fenjiu, Western tobacco, Shaoxing wine, and local yellow wine, are collecting autumn license fees for their members. The Finance Bureau was ordered to issue an order requiring them to fill out the summer business status forms, as well as the license number, address, name of the store owner and manager, and date of establishment. The various businesses in these industries found it difficult to fill out the forms and requested that they be exempted from filling them out as in previous cases. In addition to the representatives who presented the case to Director Cai in person on the 9th of this month, they jointly presented a document to Director Cai yesterday, stating: "We are submitting this document to clarify that the business status reporting forms for tobacco and alcohol merchants involve cumbersome procedures. In the past, they have always been exempted from filling them out. We respectfully request that you review and submit the matter to the Ministry for approval to exempt them from filling them out as in previous cases, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and avoid disputes. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, our members reported to the association that after paying the tobacco and alcohol license tax, they did not receive a license but only a printed form, ordering them to fill out the business status reporting form for the last quarter in order to obtain the license. The members stated that the license tax has been in place for more than 20 years, and they have never had to fill out the form. The procedures are cumbersome, and they requested the association to provide relief and forward the matter to the authorities for consideration, sympathizing with the merchants' difficulties and exempting them from filling out the form. After a joint meeting of the association, it was determined that this case does involve difficulties. The representatives presented the case to your office in person. We now list the difficulties in filling out the form below for your review: 1. In column 7 of the form, it is necessary to specify the quantity in kilograms, boxes, pieces, or dozens. The business of tobacco exchange involves soap, matches, straw paper, and goods from Beijing and Guangdong. Daily sales are scattered and mixed, mostly retail, and not recorded in detail in books. When there is a shortage of goods, they are purchased at any time. Monthly sales are roughly recorded by the number of tobacco sticks, which cannot be tracked. How can quarterly totals be calculated? Some say there is a purchase ledger that can be used for calculation. However, in 80-90% of cases, the store does not have a business ledger. How can they fill out the form? The business of soy sauce, alcohol, and soy sauce gardens involves oil, salt, soy sauce, colored wine, and other items. The daily sales situation is similar to that of tobacco exchange. Alcohol sold by the kilogram is not recorded, and even if there are ledgers, it is difficult to record. This is the reason for the difficulty in filling out the form. In other industries, although there is a record of purchases, sales are not recorded in detail because of moldy tobacco and sour wine, which are replaced and resold at any time. Only 10-20% of the stores in the city are wholesalers, and although the sales volume can be tracked, the quantity changes due to changes in the substance and the replacement of old with new, so it is not accurate. If they are forced to fill it out arbitrarily, it would be close to fabricating the report. Since there is no actual verification, it may cause unnecessary harassment. Therefore, when the license tax was handled by the Ministry in the past, it was not implemented due to various difficulties, even though there were regulations. Since the tax has different types and levels, the business is already well understood, so there is no need for a business status report. Checking the grade and verifying it is clear, and there is no doubt. Moreover, most of the merchants in these two industries are poor small merchants, either run by husband and wife or by a single person. They lack knowledge and have a large number of apprentices. To order them to fill out the form is to make them know without learning, how can that be possible? It is said that the authorities intend to rectify the situation and only need to strictly examine the grade. Merchants will not be able to obtain licenses by deception, and the tax will be prosperous. As representatives of the industry, we dare not remain silent about the difficulties of our colleagues. We respectfully submit this joint document, requesting that the Director review and submit the matter to the Ministry for approval to exempt them from filling out the form as in previous cases, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and avoid disputes. We are deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to Cai, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau."</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Agreement Expires and is Voided: Intense Competition Causes Freight Rates to Plunge, Returning to the Chaotic State Before July of Last Year</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company established a Shanghai-Tianjin shipping association with 20 private companies on July 1st of last year, with a stipulated validity period of one year, expiring on June 30th of this year. It has been decided to dissolve it. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Agreement Established</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and thirty shipping companies including the privately-owned Sanbei, Zhengji, Zhaoyu, Beifang, Yuhuo, Zhidong, Tianjin, Datongxing, Haichang, Yuanxing, Shou Kang, Yong'an, Hefengxinji, Huatong, Zhongda, Huaning, Funing, Shenquan, Shun'an, and Huitong established the Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Association on July 1st of last year. A freight rate agreement was established, with each paying a security deposit of 2,000 national currency. At the same time, the British companies Taikoo and Jardine also expressed their willingness to cooperate with the association and signed a contract with China Merchants, valid for one year.</p>
<p>Secret Competition After Implementation</p>
<p>Agreement freight rates: (A) Rice: Taikoo and Jardine 44 cents, China Merchants 42 cents, private companies 40 cents; (B) Flour: Taikoo and Jardine 20 cents, China Merchants 19 cents, private companies 18 cents. Rice freight rates include a commission for customs brokers discounted to 75%, then further discounted to 95%. Flour freight rates include a commission for customs brokers of 2 cents per dan. After implementation, all shipping companies initially complied, but then secretly competed with each other, especially the foreign companies. By June 30th of this year, after the one-year term expired, the shipping companies, recognizing the inability to prevent this competition, a portion of the members proposed dissolving the Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Association and the established agreement.</p>
<p>Dissolution of Association, Agreement Voided</p>
<p>The member shipping companies of the Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Association, as well as the British companies Taikoo and Jardine, have now passed a resolution to dissolve the association and void the agreement. The association, which was attached to the Shipping Industry Association on Guangdong Road, has ceased operations. Since the announcement of the dissolution, competition among the shipping companies has intensified, with freight rates for rice and flour from Shanghai to Tianjin falling further. In addition to the customs broker commission discount, further discounts are being offered, restoring the chaotic state that existed before July of last year.</p>
<h3>French Concession Rickshaw Pullers: Meeting to Oppose Rickshaw Puller Registration; Rickshaw Pullers Also Scheduled to Meet in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession Municipal Council announced the registration of rickshaw pullers starting on the 4th, the rickshaw pullers, finding the procedures too complicated and meaningless, have requested their rickshaw owners to lodge an objection. After a resolution by the Rickshaw Industry Association General Assembly to establish a special committee, the first meeting is scheduled for today. At the same time, the rickshaw pullers, in addition to refusing to register, are also scheduled to meet in the coming days to raise their concerns.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Artificial Silk Production in Various Countries: 1934 Production Breaks All Previous Records, United States Ranks First, Japan Second, United Kingdom Third</h3>
<p>According to a recent report from the Silk Section of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the world's artificial silk production has been increasing year by year. Since 1933, production has increased by approximately 100 million pounds annually, not only affecting the sales of raw silk, but also gradually reducing the position of cotton and wool fabrics. Last year's production totaled 775,010,000 pounds, an increase of 100,055,000 pounds compared to 1933. The United States produced 210,330,000 pounds, ranking first. Japan produced 153,100,000 pounds, ranking second. The United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, and France followed. Most noteworthy is the fact that Japan's artificial silk production increased by more than 55% in 1934 compared to 1933, making it likely to surpass the United States in the future. According to customs reports, the artificial silk imported into our country last year was valued at over 6 million yuan in national currency. The actual amount imported is impossible to verify. Artificial silk has become a necessity in our country. Our people should urgently rise up and strive for self-sufficiency.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Puller Registration: Deadline at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The registration of rickshaw pullers by the Municipal Council is now scheduled to end at the end of this month. The registration of rickshaw pullers began on November 19th of last year, with the Municipal Council establishing two registration offices to handle the matter. At that time, the Municipal Council decided that for each licensed rickshaw, the owner should recommend three people for registration. Starting in November, each license issued would be accompanied by a recommendation form, and rickshaw owners were asked to cooperate fully, ensuring that all recommended individuals were in good health and filling out all required details on the recommendation form. At the beginning of the registration process, the Municipal Council originally planned to register a total of 40,000 people. At that time, the total number of rickshaw licenses was approximately 10,000, so owners could recommend 30,000 rickshaw pullers, with the remaining 10,000 being registered directly by the Municipal Council. Later, it was decided that all 40,000 rickshaw pullers would be recommended by the owners. Recommendation forms were subsequently issued in batches, and according to regulations, all forms should have been submitted by the end of June of this year. However, this has not yet been done, so it has recently been decided that any recommendation forms issued in mid-June that have not yet been used will still be valid if used for registration this month, with July 31st as the deadline. As of today, 25,718 rickshaw pullers have been registered, with very few registrations in June. It was not until the end of the month that the Rickshaw Management Office notified the Rickshaw Owners Association to pay attention to the recommendation forms issued in June, 70% of which have not been used. They will still be valid if used this month, but registration procedures should be completed as soon as possible. Since June 30th, 723 more people have recently registered. The number of rickshaw pullers in this area seems to have reached its approximate total at this time of year.</p>

<h3>New Disputes Arise in the Fresh Meat Industry: Fellow Traders Convene a Representative Assembly Yesterday, Opposing Slaughterhouse Companies Secretly Increasing Transportation Fees</h3>
<p>Over a thousand fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai International Settlement, due to opposing the extra fees charged by the Wusong pig firms, had previously had a dispute. This was then mediated by mediators Lu Liankui, Zhou Xuexiang, etc., and as a result, the hill tribes reduced the extra fees by 30%, announcing a resolution. It is now known that the pigs handled by the industry in Wusong cost 20 cents each for loading fees, which were previously advanced by the firms. However, the transportation companies that loaded the pigs only received 15 cents per pig, with the remaining 5 cents being secretly subsidized by the transportation companies to the Ninghai, Renyuan, Suxi, and Hu Ning four slaughterhouse companies in this city as special expenses. Upon learning of this, all traders believed that the slaughterhouse companies had already been given slaughtering fees separately by the traders, but now they were secretly increasing the loading fees, disregarding the traders' suffering. Therefore, at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a general meeting of representatives from all the traders was specially convened at the Ninghai Slaughterhouse on Xinzha Road to discuss countermeasures. Representatives from Suxi, Ming, Shaoquan, Liji Wang Baotian, Ninghai Gang Xu Jinsheng, Chen Longhu, Huang Qidong, and more than a hundred others attended.

<h3>Socialite Abuses Adopted Daughter, Fined</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhen'er, a thirteen-year-old girl from Sichuan, was abducted from her hometown last year and sold to Fu Jingqing, also known as Wen Hao (formerly known as Ms. SS, a Shanghai socialite ten years ago, who played roles at the Shanghai Film Company), a woman from the same village at No. 29, Alberte Apartments, Alberte Road, French Concession, to be a maid. Because of her slow nature and unskillfulness in doing things, she was often abused by Fu Jingqing and subjected to beatings. On the morning of the 8th of this month, at 9:00 AM, the girl was beaten with a chicken feather duster by Fu because she did not wash the pillowcase cleanly, causing her to be covered in bruises. The girl could not bear the suffering and ran away. While wandering and crying on the road, she was found by Chinese Constable No. 759 and Annamite Constable No. 20 of the French Police Department, who took her to the police station and verified the injuries. The head constable sent Detective Zhang Bingcheng to arrest and deliver Fu Jingqing to the Second Special Court. The police department lawyer filed a public prosecution for the crime of injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Code. After the hearing, it was ordered that Fu pay a bail of 500 yuan and reschedule the hearing after the victim was sent to the forensic doctor for examination of the injuries. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Zhang has been examined by a forensic doctor and found to have thirteen injuries on her body, as well as three purple scars, which are obviously caused by beatings with a cane and twisting with hands. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Judge Shu Chang of the Second Special Court continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. When questioning the defendant's statement, Fu Jingqing continued to deny and evade responsibility for the injuries suffered by the victim. The court stated that the facts were clear, and then announced the start of the debate. After the French police department lawyer and the defendant's defender debated each other, Judge Shu announced the conclusion and immediately sentenced Fu Jingqing to a fine of 20 yuan for causing bodily harm, which could be commuted to one day of imprisonment for one yuan. During the appeal period, the defendant continued to pay the original bail. The victim, Zhang Zhen'er, will be sent to a charitable organization for foster care after receiving a letter.</p>
<h3>Wang Naixin Arrested for Impersonating a Section Chief of the Health Bureau</h3>
<p>The Health Bureau received a tip that a man named Wang Naixin was impersonating a section chief of the Health Bureau and extorting and fining tanneries in the Xinzhaqiao area. After the bureau sent personnel to secretly investigate, it was confirmed that this was the case. While investigating his exact address for arrest, it was unexpected that Wang Naixin had also impersonated a public security bureau official and extorted money. He was arrested by the West Gate Branch of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the headquarters. The Health Bureau has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to combine the cases for investigation and prosecution. A notice was issued to all tanneries requiring them to ask for employee identification from those who come to investigate. If a fine is to be imposed due to violations, it should be executed and receipt given by the Public Security Bureau in charge, and the investigator should not directly impose the penalty, in order to prevent impersonation.</p>
<h3>Fire at Yuque Harbor, Dapu Road</h3>
<p>At 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon, a thatch shed near Yuque Harbor on Dapu Road in the jurisdiction of the West Gate Branch of the South City Public Security Bureau suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. In an instant, it spread like wildfire. At that time, the wind was strong, and although the rescue teams from various districts heard of the incident and rushed to the rescue, the suppression of the fire was quite difficult. In addition, all the approximately 200 thatch houses were closely packed together, so once the fire started, it quickly spread to nearby areas. In less than an hour, a patch of thatch houses was turned to ashes. A total of approximately 100 houses were destroyed. Except for the ten or so houses located upwind, the rest were reduced to ashes. When the fire was raging, the residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, cried loudly, which was extremely tragic. Fortunately, there were no casualties because the fire was in the daytime. The company commander and all the policemen of the West Gate Branch Police Station of the jurisdiction were all at the scene to direct the rescue. Sun Guiwen, the fire starter (30 years old, a rickshaw puller from Jiancheng), was arrested and sent to the headquarters for disposal.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the report in your newspaper's "Local News" section regarding the robbery of the teller at the Hongchang Money Exchange and the fierce battle with police detectives, I find that many of the facts are incorrect. Upon investigation, the thief was pursued from Wuzhen Road by the Xinwen Branch, and when they passed Kulun, Officer Guo Ruiying of our station number four responded and followed closely behind. Passing the North Gongyi neighborhood, the robber fired two shots to resist arrest, but the officer skillfully dodged and returned fire, chasing him all the way. With the assistance of Officers Xiao Jinzhao of station five, Chen Junshan of station three (i.e., the officer at the Mongolia Road vegetable market), and Geng Zuxin of station six, who arrived from all sides, the thief continued to fire several shots in an attempt to resist. When they reached the intersection of Xinjiang Road and Bailu Road, Officer Zhong San of station ten blocked his path. Seeing that his situation was hopeless and there was no escape, Officer Di Yixin of the Xinwen police stepped forward and captured the thief, and Officer Chen Junshan also arrived and seized the thief's gun, finding one bullet still unfired. There were no stolen goods. Shortly after, all the officers arrived and took him to the station for registration. The thief's name is Yu Chuntao, 29 years old, from Gaoyou. He was sent to the Public Security Bureau early this morning under armed escort. This is the true account of the chase and capture of the thief. It is reported that the Xinwen Branch also captured a thief by hand, with 1,000 yuan in stolen goods, etc. We respectfully request that your editor verify and correct the report.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Mongolia Road Police Station, Xinwen Branch, Shanghai Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>July 12</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's newspaper, in the news article about the college students seducing young women, it has been verified that Sun Enpei and Zhou Shousong are not students of Datong University. This is hereby corrected.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Liu Wan Gong)</p>
<p>What people consider ugly, I may not necessarily consider ugly. Hence, beauty is in the eye of the beholder; likes and dislikes change with psychological disposition. What was considered beautiful in the past may now be considered ugly, and what is considered beautiful now may not necessarily be considered beautiful in a few years. Therefore, the world competes to admire modernity, and likes and dislikes change with the times. What is considered beautiful in one place may be considered ugly in another, and vice versa. Therefore, Europeans and Americans prefer high noses, while black people prefer wide mouths. Likes and dislikes also differ due to customs and habits. Based on this observation, is there really a fixed standard for what the world calls right and wrong, good and evil?</p>
<p>Right and wrong, good and evil, have no fixed evaluation. When a great man does things, he only needs to ask whether it is worthwhile or not, and does not need to consider the likes and dislikes of the world. For example, if killing one person can bring peace to ten million people, then it is permissible to kill him. A gentleman would not steal a golden tripod and lose his reputation for life.</p>
<h3>Being a Guest in Life</h3>
<p>— Zhen Lü</p>
<p>A new comrade named Hua Liu has joined the workers in our factory. His success story with syphilis is quite enough for the public to savor.</p>
<p>This twenty-two-year-old youth has been working in this factory for nearly two years. We know that when he first entered the factory, he had just passed his honeymoon. His new wife and his old mother lived in his old home in the countryside of Wuxi. He always remitted ten or eight yuan from Shanghai to his mother every month to support the family. Although the factory had Sundays or other holidays, he rarely went home, mainly because the round-trip expenses were not worth it. He was a frugal and discerning worker.</p>
<p>The year before last, near the end of the year, he went home once. When he returned to the factory in the new year, his face often carried a silent and unhappy expression. According to a worker who was close to him, his old mother and his new wife did not get along well daily. This time when he returned home, he did not see his wife upon entering the door. It turned out that she had been living in her parents' house for more than a month. In the stalemate of not welcoming here and not sending there, he had to outwardly obey his mother's orders and secretly go to his in-laws' house to pick up his wife, persuading and comforting her for a short time before leaving. This family dispute was enough to bother him, and his work spirit gradually decreased, leading to less earned wages!</p>
<p>It was not until the autumn of last year that his amiable appearance returned to normal. It turned out that he had been planning day and night to bring his wife to Shanghai to live with him, concealing it from his mother, and it actually came true. Soon after, he had his first child. However, the pressure of livelihood drove the mother and son back to the countryside to live with her parents, and he enjoyed only a few months of forced small family happiness, still living alone.</p>
<p>Can it be said that his excessive loneliness of not being able to live with his wife was unwarranted? He himself could not refuse the good intentions of friends who accompanied him to relieve boredom. This spring, he went out every night, and inevitably walked into the world of flowers and moon. If it is said that Guan Zhong's establishment of two hundred female entertainers to solve the sexual frustrations of travelers was a legitimate policy, then he was originally a bachelor, and his occasional enjoyment of his common male and female desires cannot be considered a violation of heavenly principles and human feelings.</p>
<p>But now, he has contracted venereal disease and has lost his job and gone home! From then on, his own degeneration and the darkness of his family's future are even more difficult to recover, and there is no need to mention them! I am afraid that this young worker will be buried under the public's view that he brought it upon himself!</p>
<h3>Retreat Before Advancing</h3>
<p>— (Miao Shen)</p>
<p>Girls' tempers are mostly not as straightforward as men's. They like to create deliberate confusion, retreating before advancing, making it difficult for you to figure them out. Men without patience and carefulness really cannot deal with this type of woman.</p>
<p>For example, you invite a certain girlfriend to see a newly arrived film tomorrow. The girlfriend clearly likes to see films, and this film is also to her liking, but she always makes excuses and refuses to go first. However, in the conversation, she secretly asks about the film's quality. Then you can be sure that she will definitely agree to go. But when she is about to leave, she earnestly tells you not to wait for her tomorrow, that she may not be able to go. However, when you visit her tomorrow, you find that she has already dressed up and is ready for the appointment.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Tears Hidden Behind the Curtain, Difficult to Escape Cold Eyes; Fortune Flaunted in Clothing, Once Reached the Gates of Power</p>
<p>Therefore, with his hands behind his back, he slowly walked towards the bottom of the canopy, acting as if he were looking for a newspaper to read on the large table. When he first came, he went straight to the table, claiming to take the newspaper on the table, but when he accidentally turned his head, he couldn't help but be surprised. The windows of Jia Duocai's room were wide open. There was originally a table and two armchairs by the window. He saw Yueying with her back to the outside of the window, facing Yao, supporting her head with her hand on the table. Zhiqian felt that he was a person who had a master of famous flowers, and the qualifications of a friend had been lost last night, and it was inappropriate to call him now. So he took a newspaper and sat opposite, looking over here. Although the newspaper was held up to block his face, his eyes still shot over the top of the newspaper, directly into the window. After a long time, Yueying actually turned her head and looked outside the window. Her eyes scattered, as if she had been awakened by some kind of sound, and she was still looking for it. Zhiqian carefully looked at her face, which seemed somewhat pale. Especially her eye sockets were covered with redness. This redness was not an ordinary happy color, dry and not moist, coupled with that dull look, it could be seen how sad she was inside. While Zhiqian was sizing her up, she also noticed a newspaper reader sitting outside, sizing her up. Originally, he only thought it was a newspaper reader, but after two minutes of attention, he could see who it was, and his face immediately changed from mustard white to purple, and he suddenly turned his head away.

<h3>Record of the Lingering Fragrance of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I still remember that incident. It seemed that someone had sent the Empress Dowager a few clusters of pink fresh flowers in a very delicate porcelain vase, and I was asked to bring them in and present them to the Empress Dowager. Because I was on duty at the time, I immediately brought them in myself. The Empress Dowager did not seem very happy when she saw them, and casually said:</p>
<p>"Put it over there!"</p>
<p>As she spoke, she also stretched out a finger, pointing to a small table in the corner of the room, meaning that I should put the vase on the table. I did as she said at first, but she had not put much thought into this command, so as soon as I approached the table, I discovered that the "flower land was not suitable"; because behind the table, there was a row of painted boards, its color was light yellow, and a bottle of pink flowers placed there was almost blended into one piece, and people who were more careless would never see it. So I immediately suggested to her:</p>
<p>"Please take a look! Old Buddha, can I put this bottle of flowers in another place?"</p>
<p>When she heard me say this, a very surprised look suddenly appeared on her face; I had not noticed this at the time, but after the fact, I remembered it, and also knew that she should indeed be so surprised!</p>
<p>"Why?" She asked me back. (364)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Elegy of Life</h3>
<p>— Lu Bai</p>
<p>It's the same person, he has a bright forehead, he has a pair of heroic eyebrows, he has two passionate eyes, he has a straight nose, he has a gentle lip, he has a majestic physique, and - but, he is a poor man.</p>
<p>It's the same college graduate, he is proficient in three or four foreign languages, he understands politics and economics, he understands social science, he can play a moving violin, he can paint a touching art painting, - but, he only made a person to call for the car.</p>
<p>Really, "Elegy of Life" Joe Jie said very right: graduation is unemployment, diploma worth a few cents!</p>
<p>Stepping out of the school gate, Qu Jianfu full of hope to find a better occupation, according to his talents, according to his learning; but hit the wall, hit the wall, the result of everywhere hit the wall, the power of the cruel reality, had already dissolved his iceberg of hope.</p>
<p>At the same time, under the development of the so-called great science, his home was bombed by the fighter planes of the great powers.</p>
<p>So, he became a lonely tramp, poor is his true color. Floating to the east, floating to the west, like a headless fly, like a flying flower in the autumn wind, aimlessly floating, floating, floating to Shanghai - a metropolis known as the Paris of the East, loaded with three million crazy citizens.</p>
<p>The days are rolled under the wheels of the Buick sports car, slipping by at the fastest speed in the world, it has been three full days since arriving in Shanghai, but when Qu Jianfu opens his eyes every morning, he always - "Where to go to think about today's life?" So worried, tears like night pearls, rolled down one by one, rolled to the corner of his mouth, rolled to his chest, rolled to his nose, rolled to his heart, it is a kind of light sour taste of plums soaked in salt water.</p>
<p>Who understands his bottom, but he is indeed a full-fledged young master sent to the university.</p>
<p>With the price of four hundred yuan, every day climbing into the bunk of a small hotel, as if it is a dream, how can he sleep there? Lying down, thinking, taking the past over and over to review, it seems that all the past prosperity is the subject of his novel. In the past it was a dream, now it is a dream, then - "I can't figure it out in my life" to raise the difficult to deal with the problem, thinking of dawn. When he climbed down the bed, his hair seemed to be white, and his beard seemed to be a point longer.</p>
<p>Finally, he waited for an opportunity, with a kind of anxiety that one second equals one day, he got an occupation, and the most painful scientific machinery of the university for three years did not make him waste his energy, and it was just right to be a coachman.</p>
<p>The owner's surname is Hong, and the 1934 new Buick sports car shows his wealth, and the mansion is on Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai.</p>
<p>Three meals of white rice will not make him feel satisfied, the furnace of society has trained him into a very calm person, his calm eyes filled with indignation, annoyance, and the waves of hatred of society. Every day, he drives the owner to the Dahua Dance Hall, the Yangtze Hotel, the Qunyufang, the Huileli, the Shenyuan Yiyuan, the Huili Ball Court, and the Nightclub. Every day, he buys ginseng regeneration pills, dragon tiger kidney pills, Bailingji, red patches, and all the famous precious tonics in Qingyutang on Beijing Road for the owner. The owner, an elderly gentleman, but the spirit is very strong, looking from afar is just like a young man in his twenties. People with money will not be old, this is very based.</p>
<p>So, he forgot all his past and worked, worked, worked.</p>
<p>The owner loves him very much, saying that he is clever, but the owner does not know that his cleverness has a source; the owner said, that is to praise him: if you could enter school to read for two or three years when you were young, you would be even more clever now!</p>
<p>Reading? Is reading useful? Fifteen years of studying under the cold window, but it is just to exchange for the position of a coachman who is called for! As soon as he thought of this, Qu Jianfu was full of gray eyes and a sad heart.</p>
<p>It's the same person, he has a bright forehead, he has a pair of heroic eyebrows, he has two passionate eyes, he has a straight nose, he has a gentle lip, he has a majestic physique, and - but he is a poor man.</p>
<p>It's the same college graduate, he is proficient in three or four foreign languages, he understands politics and economics, he understands social science, he can play a moving violin, he can paint a touching art painting,</p>
<p>But, he only made a coachman.</p>
<p>Graduation is unemployment, diploma worth a few cents. Poor elegy of life.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Museums Association Empowers and Appoints Liu Haisu as Founder</h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Haisu has finished his tour of Europe and already made two sentences, and these days he has been preparing reports and attending to public and private socializing, which has been extremely complex. Now, the Chinese Museums Association, initiated by Ma Heng, Yuan Tongli, and others in Peiping [Beijing], believes that Mr. Liu has spared no effort in advocating culture. During his painting exhibitions in various European countries, he also engaged in museum inspections, returning with a great reputation, admired by all. Therefore, they specially sent a letter inviting him to join as a founder. Mr. Liu believes that museums are indeed essential for the cultural construction of our country today, and he also replied in agreement. The two letters obtained are as follows: (1) Letter from the Chinese Museums Association to Mr. Liu: "Dear Mr. Liu, our association was formally established in Peiping on May 18th. We, the members, unanimously recommend that you, Mr. Liu, who are esteemed at home and abroad for your promotion of culture, join the ranks of the founders, in the hope that your call will be widely echoed. If you agree, please reply." (2) Mr. Liu's reply: "Dear Sirs, I have received your letter and the attached document. I am deeply moved by your enthusiasm in advocating culture and organizing the Chinese Museums Association to promote the construction of museum undertakings. The documents and plans are admirable. The literature and art of our country are indeed the essence of the nation and the treasure of the world. Foreign scholars treat even a small fragment as a priceless treasure, spending years studying it, while our own people view it casually. Over the years, destruction and theft for foreign export have caused huge losses. It is imperative to centralize them for scientific preservation and management. Haisu traveled to Europe in the winter of 1932. In addition to exhibiting paintings in various countries, he also engaged in museum inspections. Every capital city and remote town in Europe has museums established to collect artistic relics from ancient and modern times, as well as historical documents. This not only enhances the aesthetic sense of the general public but also provides resources for scholars and archaeologists to study. The collection and management of these items have become specialized fields of study. Therefore, arrangement, cataloging, binding, and storage are all carried out using precise methods, resulting in an orderly and magnificent display. In our country, apart from the Palace Museum in Peiping, the ancient relic preservation institutions in various places are all makeshift and incomplete. Now, with your far-sightedness, you have organized an association to take on the responsibility of promoting and implementing these efforts. In the future, development will be boundless. I am honored to be recommended as a founder and will certainly follow you all and do my best. Furthermore, I would like to suggest that your association establish a museum curator training institute to train talent and extend its reach to major cities, establishing branch associations in order. This will not only promote the spirit of the nation and benefit historical and archaeological researchers, but also bring glory to the country. This great undertaking, with your promotion, will surely achieve immediate results and soon establish a monument of unparalleled convenience and glory in the world of culture. As I have just unpacked and am busy with public and private matters, I cannot elaborate further."</p>

<p>Representing China's Christian Student Movement</p>

Since the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association School Association Group and the Young Women's Christian Association Student Department established contact with the federation several years ago, leaders of the federation such as Mr. Mott and Mr. Miller have visited China, offering much advice for the Christian student movement in our country. According to its regulations, the federation holds an executive committee meeting every three years. This year's meeting is scheduled to be held in the capital city of Bulgaria in August.

He is usually extremely interested in the Chinese student movement. This year, Mr. Li decided to go to the United States to study at Columbia University in order to further his education. Because he will be representing the Chinese student movement at the World Student Christian Federation Conference, he has decided to detour through Europe and visit Bulgaria first.

<h3>Finance: Swap Approaching, Gold Market Hovering</h3>
<p>Indian Silver Reportedly Rose Repeatedly Approaching the Thirty Yuan Mark; Large Dealers Dumping Purchases Resulting in a Recovery of One Yuan Six</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday rose because foreign silver prices were frequently rising. The market once broke into the thirty yuan range, with large dealers' buying enthusiasm aggressive, the Hong Kong market softened, and there was a sudden rise mid-way. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong market gradually became firmer again, and Indian silver rose again, breaking the thirty yuan mark. Large dealers' buying intention did not weaken, and as a result, it slightly recovered. Early morning, because overseas silver markets in Britain and the United States uniformly continued to rise, but the Jardine Matheson "foot" claimed that India sold after the market closed, the market situation was relatively soft, and the forward silver price in Montreux also rose by 7.5 li to between 0.014 yuan. London spot gold fell by 3 pence, and exchange rates fell slightly. Before the market opened, ready-made trading opened, immediately retreated to the thirty yuan range. Large dealers such as Fuxing, Yonghengchang, Yong, and others entered, and were immediately pulled up, rising to thirty-one yuan. The Central Bank's exchange rate announcement showed that the pound was flat and the dollar contracted. The Customs Gold Unit contracted by 3 li, and the standard gold price was posted at 867 yuan and 3 jiao, which greatly affected the yuan. After opening, demand exceeded supply, and the situation turned stable. The Central Bank released shillings, and there was still hovering. The bank still had a buying appetite, and large dealers such as Dadecheng and others continued to pour in, still appearing prosperous. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's exchange rate announcement revealed that both the pound and the dollar were flat, although they had risen, they were still hovering. Afterwards, the Hong Kong market reported softening, which led to a resurgence of buyers, and it rose again. However, because large dealers took advantage of the high prices to sell, it soon turned flat. The bank took the opportunity to release, and the Hong Kong market returned to firmness, and selling gradually became more active, gradually flowing downstream. When the Reuters telegram reported that Indian silver was predicted to rise by 8 annas, it once retreated into the thirty yuan range, but sellers took advantage of the low prices to replenish, and at noon, it turned mediocre. In the afternoon, Indian silver was reported to have risen by 12 annas, the foot became firmer, the Hong Kong market continued to loosen by 0.125, and the market broke into the thirty yuan range. Large dealers worked hard to maintain it, and it was rumored that the bank was also purchasing bars, and it was immediately pulled up after opening. The bank's appetite was still high, and the exchange market was loosening. Although there was selling, there was much hovering. Afterwards, Indian silver receded a second time, shrinking by 3 annas, and buyers poured in even more. In the end, the situation stabilized.

<p>According to foreign telegrams, the London market rose by 0.1875 in both the near and far terms.

The pound exchange rate was 1 shilling and 7 pence and 0.125, and the dollar exchange rate was 39.5 yuan, with the pound loosening by 0.0625 and the dollar firming by 0.125 compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's exchange rate announcement showed that the pound was flat and the dollar shrank by 0.0625, and the Customs Gold Unit fell by 3 li. People's minds were still calm. After opening, although the Central Bank was cautious, the bank still had reciprocal transactions and stabilized. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's exchange rate announcement revealed that both the pound and the dollar were flat, and the situation was hovering. After entering, the bank slightly bought, and the Hong Kong market reported tightening, and the situation was slightly tighter. The bank took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the Hong Kong market gradually returned to a firm 0.1875. Indian silver was predicted to rise by 8 annas, and the domestic market returned to loosen, but the overall trend was very flat. In the afternoon, because Indian silver initially reported an increase of 12 annas, and the British exchange rate in the Hong Kong market also firmed by 0.125, the market firmed immediately after opening. The bank also released, and the psychological state of Chinese merchants was quite good. All buys were able to support it.

<p>Careful Discounting of Bills, Slightly Lower Heading</p>
<p>In the financial industry these days, due to careful discounting of bills between peers, without indiscriminate practices, the bill market has been quietly peaceful, lacking the vigor of competitive expansion. As a result, the price of foreign drafts has been 0.2 jiao throughout the recent half-month, resembling a fixed-plate article. The heading has increased, and because the heading liners are mostly lacking, they are now all straightened out by the financial industry reserve treasury. Therefore, the changes in heading are decided by the treasury, and only transactions are conducted in the market. The heading increase to the treasury was slightly less than 2.6 million yuan yesterday, with more than 30 new transactions. In the noon market, the morning market transferred more than 2.6 million yuan, with more than 300,000 new transactions, and no transactions. In the small general association, transactions were more than 600,000, 900,000 in banknotes were withdrawn, and 600,000 in circulating tickets and secret tickets were issued. More than 200,000 yuan in foreign pledged money was redeemed, and 400,000 in new loans were made. Guest routes came and went with about 780,000. Bank receipts and payments: Foreign banks received and paid out over 2.1 million in bills, various goods, exchange mortgages, and miscellaneous payments of 3.56 million yuan, 900,000 in foreign exchange settlement, 400,000 in special exchange, 200,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese banks received and paid out 2.34 million in bills, 300,000 in special exchange, 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 3.9 million in various goods, exchange taxes, mortgages, and miscellaneous payments. 300,000 in warehouse exits. Japanese banks received and paid out 2.5 million in bills, 2.9 million in various goods and miscellaneous expenses, 500,000 in special exchange, 1 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 200,000 in warehouse entries. Foreign bank public bills received and paid out over 37 million, 5.45 million in foreign initial loans, over 800,000 in various exchange loans, and cash received and paid out. Because the current heading liners are straightened out by the reserve treasury, there are not many deficiencies to be counted. Yesterday, there were no transactions for Jiangnan small foreign currencies in the morning or afternoon, so the market price remained unchanged at 830 yuan, the same as the previous day. The inflow and outflow of Guangdong small foreign currencies were also rare, and trading was not as strong as in the past. The market price was slightly lower, with 734.5 yuan in the morning and a further decrease of 0.3 jiao in the afternoon, at 734.2 yuan. The morning transaction was 175,000 jiao, and the afternoon transaction was 40,000 jiao. Steel yuan was revised to a reduction of 1,000 wen, to 341,000 wen. Transactions were made for 33,418 strings, equivalent to 9,800 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<p>In addition, the total number of bill exchanges in this city was 8,797,694.53 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<p>The total number of exchanges was 4,426,141.41 yuan in silver dollars, 2,747,584.29 yuan in exchange transfers in silver dollars, 1,623,968.83 yuan in total collections by the financial industry, and 96 large households absorbed a dramatic rise of more than one yuan from outsiders.</p>
<h3>Securities Bullish Sentiment for Public Bonds Intensifies</h3>
<p>Large Investor Absorbs Bonds, Price Jumps Over One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the bullish sentiment was strong. The bearish side, due to excessively scattered chips, saw its lines waver. The market situation suddenly changed, and the rising trend became powerful. The long-dormant Ninety-Six Public Bonds were suddenly absorbed by large investors yesterday, and the market price suddenly rose sharply. This is because, during the current adjustment in Sino-Japanese relations, the bond is extremely susceptible to its stimulus. The trend suggests that with the absorption by large investors continuing, there may still be a rapid rise.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s trading started with the momentum from the previous day’s gains. The bearish side actively covered their positions. Large investors absorbed bonds at prices of 48.53, 48.16, and 48.14, further strengthening the rising trend. Unified Tax Bonds rose sharply by one yuan. Later trading was more moderate, as the previous market had risen too much, and the market price was slightly squeezed. In the second session, the earlier bonds remained flat, while the later bonds saw some selling around 54, and the trading floor seemed to be pushing prices down, causing a slight pullback. However, due to the enthusiastic atmosphere, the Twenty-Third Customs Bonds rebounded sharply by 0.40 yuan. The afternoon session saw a change in the primary market. Demobilization and troop reduction bonds fell slightly, while Unified Tax Bonds and others boosted confidence. The bearish side rushed to cover their positions, and prices for 53, 48.14 rose again by up to 0.50 yuan. Ninety-Six Public Bonds, due to large-scale absorption at 72, 69.4, surged by more than 0.50 yuan.</p>
<p>In summary, the market prices for the entire day rose uniformly from 0.30 to 0.50 yuan to around one yuan. Ninety-Six Public Bonds also rose by 0.40 to 0.50 yuan. The total trading volume was 22,216,300 yuan. The highest and lowest prices and results are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Declines Across the Board</p>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm, yesterday (July 11), the New York stock market saw profit-taking after gains. Additionally, the House of Representatives passed an amendment regarding the Tennessee Valley Authority, expanding the government's standard electricity fee plan, which led to a loosening in utility stocks. Consequently, the market situation also declined. However, trading was sluggish, and commercial reports were quite positive, so the decline was limited, with the largest being no more than two dollars. Stocks on the small exchange were dragged down by utility stocks. The bond market saw mixed ups and downs. The total trading volume for the day was one million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton  Yarn Prices Hover, Auctioned Yarn Improves Slightly</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, with the situation remaining normal. The economic situation is difficult to fully ease for the time being. Yarn sales in various regions are sluggish, but the base has bottomed out. The market rises and falls unpredictably, but in the overall trend, it does not deviate from a hovering situation.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Futures See Covering of Short Positions  In the early session of auctioned yarn, prices for all months declined uniformly, with the near-month contracts falling particularly sharply. With foreign cotton trending down, bullish positions were closed. The front-month contract broke through the 59 yuan level, reaching a recent new low. In the second and third sessions, due to short squeezes in raw cotton, the yarn market rallied, resulting in near-month contracts falling by 1.30 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while far-month contracts rose by 0.10 yuan. The afternoon session saw a slightly tighter market situation, with profit-takers covering short positions. Market prices rose step by step, but spot yarn trading remained quiet. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, and 0.90 yuan compared to the morning closing prices. It was found that Sui Lung sold 750 bales, Kit Fung 600 bales, Yi Da 950 bales, Ming Teh 550 bales, Jui Da 650 bales, Chang Yu 900 bales, Heng Chang 500 bales, and Keng Fung 700 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales are normal. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 401 bales throughout the day. Japanese yarn trading amounted to over 200 bales. Prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<h3>Auctioned Cotton Bulls Rumored to Be Organized</h3>
<p>There is talk in the cotton market that the bulls for the July and August contracts are organized companies preparing for a short squeeze. Therefore, the situation is particularly strong. In reality, there are too many short positions held by retail investors, so once there is a rebound, the market will rise even more. However, overseas cotton markets have turned down, yarn sales are not picking up, and cotton sales are also limited.</p>
<p>Near-Month Bulls Increase Positions</p>
<p>In the early session of auctioned cotton, although American and Indian cotton markets fell, there were still many buyers in the market. It is said that there are companies organized on the bullish side, buying and adding to their positions in the July and August contracts. Market prices were particularly firm. As a result, near-month contracts rose by 0.15 to 0.20 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while far-month contracts rose by 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon session, the bulls continued to enter the market, and prices gradually increased. Due to limited deliveries, the price of the current month contract rose by 0.30 yuan compared to the morning closing price, reaching a high point. The prices of far-month contracts were flat. It was found that Chang Ho sold 2,600 dan, Da Fu 2,400 dan, Ho Yu 2,700 dan, Tai Hsing 2,600 dan, Ming Hua 1,900 dan, Keng Fung 1,400 dan, Jen Fung 1,200 dan, Chang Fung 1,100 dan, Tai Chang 1,000 dan, and Yi Chang 2,300 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Brokers Turn to Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with poor news from Liverpool, favorable weather, Southern factories planning to continue reducing work in August, a weak grain market, and retail brokers turning to selling. Liverpool bankers were selling short. Prices for all months fell by 9 to 14 points. Spot merchants needed to be calmer. Traders absorbed cotton during the price drop. Most merchants are waiting for the development of the agricultural amendment. Textile demand turned brisk due to the price drop. Closing was relatively stable. Spot cotton fell 10 points, futures fell 9 to 11 points. British spot cotton rose one point, futures fell three to four points. Indian cotton initially rose due to covering short positions, but weakened due to prominent bulls selling. It then rose again due to the firmness of Broach cotton. As a result, Flatgor fell by 1 to 1.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 0.25 to 1.75 rupees, and Broach rose/fell by 0.25 to 1.25 rupees. Original telegram record below (July 11 telegram):</p>

<h3>Chinese Factories Reduce Production, Yarn Inventory Gradually Decreases</h3>
<p>--Total Inventory: Over 74,800 Bales--</p>
<p>According to a survey by a certain foreign firm, as of the end of June, the total quantity of Chinese and Japanese yarn in Shanghai was 74,816 bales, an increase of 3,984 bales compared to the end of May. Among them, Japanese yarn was 17,1305 bales, an increase of 4,463 bales compared to the previous month, and Chinese yarn was 57,511 bales, a decrease of 479 bales compared to the previous month. The quantity and counts of Chinese and Japanese yarn are listed below (unit: bales):</p>
<p>Count  Quantity  Count  Quantity</p>
<p>4-count  1,600  6-count  2,543</p>
<p>8-count  2,150  10-count  9,450</p>
<p>12-count  2,803  16-count  17,815</p>

<p>Total  74,816 bales</p>
<h3>Grains  Foreign Wheat Continues to Be Ordered, Flour and Wheat Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>The flour market remains flat and weak. Foreign wheat quotes in Chicago fell by around 3, 4, and 5 cents, while Canadian wheat fell by 1/4 to 1.0 cents. Market sentiment is even weaker due to the drop in foreign wheat prices. It is also rumored that factories have ordered two more ships of Australian wheat at a price of only 4.40 yuan. Although the hedging has not been sold, the sentiment both inside and outside the industry is softened, as purchasing power from various regions is weak, making hedging difficult. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was relatively active. Factory sales only slightly reduced near-term positions, while far-term positions remained unchanged. Therefore, in the midst of hovering, the market temporarily stabilized. Observing the situation going forward, if actual sales do not move, and factories continue to order foreign wheat, it will be difficult to maintain stability. As a result, the price for this month fell by 1 cent, the prices for August, September and October fell by 1.25 cents, and the price for November did not.</p>
<p>Wheat prices fell uniformly across all months after the morning and afternoon sessions. Initially, due to the sharp drop in foreign wheat prices, sentiment was naturally difficult to boost. However, factories stopped handling spot wheat for near-term months, and customers had to engage in hedging. For far-term months, traders had already ordered foreign wheat and could gradually sell it off. This type of trading is known in the industry as "insurance business." With the chips being very real, buyers are naturally more fearful. The small decline in the market is mainly due to this. The massive floods in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins prevent sentiment from rallying, and the power to dump goods far outweighs the domestic environment. As a result, the price for this month fell by 5 cents, the price for August fell by 4 cents, the price for September fell by 5 cents, and the price for October fell by 3 cents. The spot wheat market is again at a standstill. Factories are uniformly rejecting spot wheat due to weak flour sales and cheap foreign wheat. It is feared that selling at a loss is inevitable.</p>

<h3>Hot Weather Causes囤戶 to Eagerly Sell Off, Both Domestic and Foreign Rice Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Local rice (Shanghai South) source of goods from various groups yesterday was slightly scarce, totaling 16 or 17 sources, (goods total over 3,000 piculs) its fatigued market color remains lifeless. Sales market on this street is unusually sluggish, only customer channels have Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin and other groups handling 600-700 bags, so the situation once again declined. Prices for various thick japonica and thin indica rice fell by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, except for Transformation Yuan (变元), which also weakened without energy. (Shanghai North) sources goods totaled 18 or 19 sources, various goods were consumed, white japonica was weak, early japonica and thin indica rice were slightly better-selling. White Yuan sales remain lacking, white japonica early thin indica prices were a little over 0.20 yuan lower, white yuan was also a few cents to nearly 0.10 yuan lower. And with this weather, it is difficult to improve, without unexpected sales channels, there is absolutely no hope of rebounding.</p>
<p>Foreign rice market, the situation has once again changed, recently high-priced rice sold well and prices were firm, medium and low-grade rice were flat. Yesterday only because high-grade Saigon rice had new arrivals, sales became quiet, and medium and low-grade rice had consumption from various ports along the Yangtze River and Tianjin, Ningbo and other places, and the market was instead firm. But as the weather has gradually gotten hotter in recent days, those囤積 rice anxiously seek to sell, so even more river boats loaded with rice are lowering prices seeking to sell off, foreign rice is inevitably suppressed by it. Saigon No. 1 rice immediately fell by several cents to nearly 0.10 yuan, other grades of mid- and low-grade rice were still able to stabilize. The total daily exports include 7,500 bags of Saigon, 1,500 bags of Little Twisted, 3,000 bags of Siamese broken rice, Annam japonica rice and Songjiang rice and others 500 bags. Most of the sales went to various ports along the Yangtze River, and sales to the Ningbo group from the north were also active, local domestic sales were only slightly receptive.</p>
<h3>Why Bean Cakes Always Fall at This Time</h3>
<p>The bean cake market always experiences a period of weakness a few days before the French National Day, so those who trade in bean cakes generally copy this old pattern. Therefore, the market yesterday was already filled with a weak atmosphere. Fortunately, trading was not quiet. Prices for factory cakes remained stable due to a lack of spot goods. Customer cakes, upon arrival, inevitably crowded the market and were prone to falling. The total trading volume was 3,400 pieces of factory cakes and 8,700 pieces of customer cakes for spot and forward delivery. Please refer to the market price section for various prices.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market  Domestically Produced White and Red Sugar Sell Continuously</h3>
<p>The trend in the sugar market remained flat and weak yesterday. The Guild listed No. 24 coarse sugar for 16 yuan for spot goods and 4.80 yuan for transit goods, but neither was transacted. Taikoo sugar and domestically produced fine white sugar saw little fluctuation, with few buyers. The only listing was a batch of regular white and red sugar from the Chaozhou group, totaling over 200 bags, with the higher price being 11.30 yuan to 11.10 yuan, and the average being 11 yuan to 10.08 yuan. Eastern white (J) brand was 16.20 yuan, (N) brand was 16.05 yuan. The asking price for higher-quality Eastern red sugar tightened to 12 yuan, but no sale was made.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea  Both Red and Green Tea Trading is Brisk</h3>
<p>The shape of the foreign-operated tea market yesterday remained stable. British and French companies spared no effort in seeking out green teas from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other regions, such as Chunmee and Needle-Shaped teas. Trading volume of green teas from various regions totaled over 2,900 cases, and trading was quite active. Red teas from Yichang, Qimen, and other regions were also traded by firms such as Tung Fu, Hsieh Ho, and Chin Lung, with over 2,300 cases being traded. However, the red tea market has been sluggish for a long time, and prices have fallen by 7 or 8 yuan compared to previous weeks. Based on the current market situation, green tea still holds the advantage.</p>

<p>Publishing World</p>
<h3>How to Develop the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>Culture and publishing have a close relationship. To develop culture, it is necessary to develop the publishing industry. Naturally, from the perspective of publishing, the situation is extremely bleak. Even bookstores with strong capital must rely on pre-orders and 50% discounts to absorb cash. Just maintaining the status quo is difficult, let alone development? However, from a cultural standpoint, there is a need to vigorously seek development.</p>
<p>Why is this? The obvious fact is that Chinese culture is backward. As long as you look around in the cultural sphere, you truly don't see China. This is something everyone knows, except for the restorationists and megalomaniacs who have never understood world culture.</p>
<p>So, how do we develop publishing? In terms of quantity, I feel that we need to publish more books.</p>
<p>Bookstores are the center of publishing, so naturally they should publish more books. I feel that they should be supported in every way. If not, at the very least, this policy should be implemented: Laissez-faire, Laissez-passer. In this way, they will not suffer losses and will be able to fulfill their publishing function.</p>
<p>In addition to bookstores, I feel that many institutions and organizations should bear part of the responsibility for publishing.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about academic societies. Academic societies are concerned with research or encouraging research, so they should strive for publishing activities. There are many academic societies in China, large and small, general and specialized, almost everything that should be there. However, not all of them have publishing ventures. Those that do often seem perfunctory, just to put on a show. Otherwise, since they have gathered many scholars and experts, why don't they strive for publishing ventures? From now on, I feel that each academic society should use publishing to demonstrate its achievements. At the very least, there should be an organizational journal and two series of books—one for translating world classics and one for accommodating members' creations.</p>
<p>Secondly, organizations that should be committed to publishing are research institutes and translation bureaus. The state uses money to run them to absorb researchers to engage in research and translation. Research reports should be published as books. China also has research institutes and translation bureaus, and they also have publications. But judging from the existing achievements, it seems that it is not enough. In the future, they should actively invigorate themselves and strive in the publishing field.</p>
<p>Thirdly, schools can also bear some responsibility for publishing. Universities, the so-called highest institutions of learning, should, like academic societies, have organizational journals and published series of translations. Their professors are all scholars and experts and engage in research, so they should naturally publish their research findings. And only in this way can they prove that what they teach is not the sale of knowledge. Most universities in China currently have publishing ventures, but they are not widespread, not active, and have few achievements. Therefore, it is necessary to awaken them to fulfill their responsibility as the highest institutions of learning through publishing.</p>
<p>If academic societies, research institutes, translation bureaus, and universities can all strive for publishing and not let bookstores be solely responsible, then the development of the publishing industry can be rapid. In this way, culture will also progress. China can emerge from its backward state and live up to its reputation as an ancient cultural country. Do you want to revitalize culture? I think we should start with developing the publishing industry.</p>
<p>As for the quality aspect, I feel that we should strive for progress. Here, I will divide my opinions into several points to explain.</p>
<p>First, we should not publish too many ancient Chinese books. Ancient Chinese books must be read by experts to understand the various evolutions of China's past. However, their value is limited. If, like now, everyone competes to publish and sell them, on the one hand, it echoes the undercurrent of restoration, and on the other hand, it fuels the expansion of the undercurrent of restoration. This is really not a good way. The publishing industry should stand on the position of promoting culture.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are not only many ancient books now, but also many editions of the same book. Although the covers are renewed, I think that in these few years, the only one with value is the Gujin Tushu Jicheng (Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times). Most of the others are just superfluous and create clever names to sell money. This is almost purely a commercial method, with little cultural meaning.</p>
<p>Second, I feel that we should publish more ancient foreign books from various European countries. Because they are absolutely necessary for research. We should "catch up" with foreign political and economic systems and take the new as the best. Only for the theories of philosophy and science should we both "catch up" and follow behind. The so-called catching up means learning their latest things in order to create forward. But at this time, reviewing the past and absorbing their traditions to deepen our sources is impossible without reading ancient foreign books. This is not only for history but also necessary for current research.</p>
<p>However, this is very rare in the Chinese publishing industry. Many famous works in the history of philosophy and science have not been published. I hope that every specialized academic society can edit two books of famous works in their field; one classical and one realistic. Although China has its own philosophy and science in the past, it does not have the tradition of philosophy and science in terms of modern European development. People who introduce Western culture should pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>Third, we should publish more books on philosophy and science. This is very necessary both theoretically and technically. It has a great relationship to the modernization of our thinking, actions, and even our entire lives. This is a starting point or important matter for developing culture and transforming society.</p>
<p>I feel that both ordinary and profound aspects are needed. Without a large number of publications on ordinary philosophy and science, it is impossible to raise the majority of people to the general cultural level of the current world. Without a large number of publications on profound philosophy and science, it is impossible to raise a few people to the theoretical level of current world experts and allow us to enter the door of creation. Therefore, both ordinary and profound philosophical and scientific works are where the publishing industry should devote its efforts.</p>
<p>Fourth, because of this, it is now necessary for specialized bookstores to divide their work and advance together, including everything. Large bookstores can publish this and that. Small bookstores should especially choose an academic category as their publishing policy to create their characteristics. Or it is right to divide according to the nature of thought. In the past, small bookstores, from 1928 onwards, competed to publish new ideological works on the one hand, and specialized in one field in literature and social sciences on the other hand, which made great contributions to Chinese culture. If the Chinese cultural movement is divided from the nature of thought, with the "May Fourth Movement" as the first phase and the period after "1928" as the second phase, then the contributors in this phase are entirely small bookstores. General large bookstores are too conservative and have not made the slightest contribution. They have not suffered any oppression in their business, but this is indeed their shame!</p>
<p>Now it is different. Many small bookstores have been competing to publish textbooks and children's books in the past two or three years. This should not be the case. Even from a business perspective, they cannot compete with large bookstores. As a result, they have no strengths. The day the publishing characteristics are lost is the day the cultural mission ends. May the small bookstores that still exist today restore their past specialized nature.</p>
<p>These are the things I have thought of for the time being from the quality aspect to seek the development of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Publishing is very important to culture, so there should be a plan for both the quantitative and qualitative aspects. People engaged in culture should pay attention to this. And they must also adopt a critical attitude towards the publishing industry in order to correct it. Otherwise, if the cause is created badly, it will be difficult to guarantee a good result, and the future culture will become dark.</p>
<h3>About the Pricing of Books</h3>
<p>— Leng Feng</p>
<p>Buying books is really unaffordable. Although I try my best to save money, I plan to buy three or five books every month, but my income is small, and I feel extremely troubled. Opening the newspaper, looking at the advertisements for new books and old books, I am very greedy in my heart, but looking at the prices and touching my own purse, I have to sigh and let it go. There must be many readers who feel the same way!</p>
<p>Indeed, the price of books is too expensive. A thin book costs eight cents or one yuan. The money to buy a book is enough for a poor person to eat for a few days. We are not rich friends. After seeing such expensive book prices, what can we do except sigh?</p>
<p>Because book prices are expensive, everyone scolds the bookstore owner in unison, saying that he only knows how to make money and does not care whether people can afford to buy books, as if people's money is stolen, robbed, or picked up, and it is right to give it to him, and his heart is as black as coal! Everyone should tear off his mask of "promoting culture"!</p>
<p>Some friends who understand the real situation of the publishing industry are not so angry and have quite a bit of forgiveness for the bookstore owner. They said that the cost of a book is 25 cents, and the reason why the bookstore owner has to price it at one yuan is that the author has to draw a royalty of 10% to 20%, which takes away one or two cents; if the bookstore that sells on consignment wholesales it, it gets a 30% discount, which takes away three cents. In this way, the cost of 25 cents has become 75 cents. In addition, the interest on the accounts owed by the consignment bookstore and the cost of advertising in the newspaper take away 15 cents. Then his cost is 25 cents, and he sells it to you for one yuan, and he only earns one cent from you. In addition, the loss of old books, he can't even earn one cent. Saying that the bookstore owner's heart is as black as coal is really wrong! In these years of recession, the business is not much, and the debts owed outside cannot be collected. Even if they are collected, there will be a discount. How can the bookstore owner have money to earn? If he doesn't do well, he will lose even his own "capital", so many bookstores can't afford to lose money and close down. We should not only scold the bookstore owner's heart as black as coal, we should pity him and give him some sympathy!</p>
<p>Of course, this is not wrong. However, it still feels too expensive to sell a cost of 25 cents for one yuan. We want to forgive the bookstore owner on the one hand, and at the same time we really feel that the price of books is too expensive. Then naturally; we can only scold that group of book dealers. They wholesale to the publishing industry, and they actually want to earn 30 cents in the middle, which is extremely black-hearted! We want to pity the bookstore owner and want book prices to be cheaper; then we can only defeat this group of book dealers and implement the direct relationship between readers and bookstore owners! In the past, some bookstores' "reading clubs" declared when they widely recruited members that they wanted to defeat the book dealers who made profits in the middle and implement the direct relationship between the publishing industry and readers—that is, they hoped that the readers would directly order by mail. Of course, this also contains the intention of absorbing cash.</p>
<p>However, many bookstore owners cannot be pitied and forgiven for selling a cost of 25 cents for one yuan. Because he wholesales to others at a 30% discount and then owes money, why does he still charge the full price to readers who pay in cash? If he sells to readers at the same price as wholesale, the readers will of course be very grateful, and the cooperation between readers and bookstores will be realized immediately. Then the book dealers in the middle will naturally fall without being beaten. Now they are willing to wholesale at a 30% discount but are unwilling to sell to readers at a 30% discount, which means that they do not want readers to cooperate with them but want the book dealers in the middle to make money, which is very clear. So why should we pity and forgive him? The bookstore owner is treating the readers as fools, and the readers are still unaware!</p>
<p>However, after all, because of the recession, they are forced to sell at a 30% to 20% discount or even half price. Aren't there many bookstores selling cheap books now? I hope they can turn around from now on and adopt the principle of small profits but quick turnover.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Various Bookstores (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>23. Shanghai Magazine Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai Magazine Company is a timely and clever creation in the magazine year. Its owner, Mr. Zhang, is a senior in the book industry with experience, and he was also a "pen pusher" before. The oldest and now defunct Guanghua Bookstore is related to him, and the United Bookstore, which promoted itself as a social science bookstore in the "Social Science Year" (imitating the name of the magazine year), was also founded by him. He also presided over the Modern Bookstore, which previously wanted to create a literary book trust. With such a senior in the book industry managing the first magazine company in the magazine year, its success is naturally expected.</p>
<p>We believe that the prevalence of magazines is a deformed development of the publishing industry's decline. Because: First, the decline in the purchasing power of the general public; Second, the common sense of "specialized knowledge needs" has created the unprecedented development of magazines--but this is somewhat exaggerated. In fact, the development of magazines in China today is only the development of picture magazines and humorous sketches, and has nothing to do with specialized academics.</p>
<p>Just as literary books are followed by social science books, followed by textbooks, followed by magazines, magazines are now nearing the end of their strength. First, magazines that have a status cannot maintain their status permanently, and new magazines are too "crude and shoddy," which can reduce readers' faith. For example, the Analects can be regarded as one of the top red items, but now it is slowly making readers tired. Moreover, most people read magazines for some fun or stimulation, and this component is difficult to last. The decline in magazine business is naturally expected. Second, from the perspective of the magazine itself, it is not the best business, because the price of magazines is cheap, often less than the cost, so that few magazines are not losing money. The Shanghai Magazine Company used to publish several magazines itself, but now they have all been changed to classics, which is for this reason. But relying only on resale commissions, the profit is very low. Although the manager of the Shanghai Magazine Company is capable, I am afraid that he will not be able to overcome the objective difficulties.</p>
<p>Now, other magazine companies are rising one after another, such as Zhonghua and Qunzhong, which are of course a blow to "Shanghai," but the biggest blow is still the increasingly complete magazine distribution departments of various bookstores, such as Shenghuo and Kaiming, whose appeal will certainly be greater than that of those who simply sell magazines.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are not optimistic about the future of the magazine year.</p>

<h3>Comparison of Wireless Electrical Component Imports in the Last Three Years</h3>
<p>— Wu Chou</p>
<p>Imports from January to May this year exceeded 2.2 million yuan, and Japanese goods have increased sharply.</p>
<p>In recent years, the development of the domestic wireless radio industry has been rapid. At a time when all industries are declining, this industry alone has a booming appearance. This contradictory state is not what ordinary people can expect.</p>
<p>The development of China's wireless radio industry began after 1929. As of today, the broadcasting stations in this port registered with the International Telecommunications Bureau are: Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, Asia-America, Dongfang, Zhongxi, Huamei, Yongsheng, Fuxing, Li Shudetang, Mingyuan, Foyin, Meishoutang, Huatai, Dadong, Xihuamei, Donglu, Shenshi, Huaqiao, Tongle, Kuaile, Jianhua, Zhou Xieji, Yadong, Xinxin, Dundutang, Dunbentang, Laubaisheng, Fuyin, Anding, Youlian, Yuanchang, Yasheng, Zhonghua, Dazhonghua, Hongkang, Guotai, Lida, Lili, Huaxing, Sunshi, Shiyin, Huadong, Xinsheng, Huijin, Diansheng, Kongshi, Hengsen, Heming, Penglai, Qimei, Huaguang, Yangshi, etc., a total of 52 companies. Except for Dadong, Laubaisheng, Qimei, and Xihuamei, which are operated by foreigners. Forty-seven are operated by Chinese businessmen. Now the municipal government is planning to set up a large-scale broadcasting station in the city center. The wireless radio stations in this port can be called the most prosperous time. The installation of radios in this port is estimated to reach more than 100,000. With a total of more than 3 million citizens, an average of about 30 people has a radio. This shows the people's need for this emerging industry.</p>
<p>China's wireless radio industry. It is as prosperous as mentioned above. However, very few domestically produced machines are seen. Foreign goods are coming in continuously, which is expected. According to the Customs, in the five months from January to May of this year, the imported wireless electrical components and parts in this city were worth 2,226,052 yuan in customs gold, equivalent to 2,201,989 silver yuan. Compared with the import amount of 952,998 yuan in customs gold in the same period last year, calculated in customs gold, it increased by 23%. If we compare the import amount of 606,359 yuan in customs gold in the same period in 1933 with this year, the import amount in the last three years has suddenly increased by more than one time. Looking at the import countries in 1933, the United States was the first. Britain and Germany were second. The Netherlands was next. Japan only imported more than 7,000 yuan in customs gold, ranking last. However, in the import amount in the same period last year, Japan jumped over Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries with more than 80,000 yuan in customs gold, ranking third, an increase of 12 times compared with 1933. This year, Japan has surpassed Germany again, ranking second. The import amount is more than 278,000 yuan. In the last three years, the import of Japanese goods has suddenly increased by more than 38 times. It shows a soaring appearance. In the future, I am afraid that it will not be less than the number of the United States. Is this kind of phenomenon presented in the year of domestic goods a contradiction? I hope that the Chinese people will rise up quickly, seek manufacturing themselves, and fill this leak. The comparative table of import countries in the last three years and the table for May are listed below. For reference.</p>
<p>Country/Year January to May, 1933 January to May, 1934 January to May, 1935 May, 1935</p>
<p>Germany 56,285 92,506 43,405 10,887</p>
<p>Britain 91,383 29,656 154,301 6,419</p>
<p>Japan 7,337 82,567 278,573 102,171</p>
<p>Netherlands 12,928 37,640 4,405 519</p>
<p>United States 366,708 690,981 1,326,052 90,576</p>

<h3>The Ionosphere Reflecting Shortwave Telecommunications</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>After the shortwave telecommunication is emitted from the transmitter, it is divided into two types: sky wave and ground wave. The ground wave travels along the ground and gradually disappears due to absorption in about 50 miles to 100 miles. The sky wave can complete the mission of long-distance communication because it is reflected in the high altitude. If we want reliable long-distance communication, we must pay attention to the ionosphere (Ionosphere) that reflects shortwave telecommunications.</p>
<p>As early as 1902, Kennelly and Heaviside proposed a hypothesis at the same time that the object reflecting wireless radio waves in the high altitude is a layer of electricity-conducting material. This hypothesis has now been proved in fact. And the electricity-conducting material in that layer. According to the latest test results, it is caused by the ionization of gas in the high altitude.</p>
<p>The atmosphere surrounding the earth can be divided into several layers according to the first picture, among which the "ionosphere" is where the wireless radio waves are reflected.</p>
<p>The easiest way to study the ionosphere is to measure the shortest time required for the wireless radio wave emitted from the ground to travel back and forth between the ground and the ionosphere. Because the speed of the radio wave is known, the distance between the transmitter and the reflection of the radio wave can be indirectly calculated. However, the reflection of the radio wave by the city ionosphere is different from the reflection of the light ray by the mirror, so the height of the ionosphere obtained is also divided into "real height" and "pseudo height". The pseudo height is the height of the radio wave's sharp vertical reflection, and its speed remains unchanged; the real height is the maximum height that the radio wave can actually reach, as shown in the second picture. It can be seen from the figure that the pseudo height is easy to calculate, while the real height is complicated and difficult to calculate. However, in fact, if the measured pseudo height does not change sharply due to the change of the radio wave's week rate, then the number of the pseudo height is approximately equal to the real height.</p>
<p>If the week rate of the radio wave is sharply changed in a very short time, and the pseudo height is measured at the same time, a curve like the third figure can be obtained. It can be seen from the figure that the curve has a sharp break at a certain number of points. According to the explanation of the testers, this break is caused by the radio wave just penetrating a certain reflection layer and the rate is reduced.</p>
<p>According to this test result, it is known that there are at least five reflection layers in the ionosphere that reflect radio waves; their height is not fixed and can be changed at any time, and the names and order of each layer are also detailed in the first figure. The reflection ability of the Er and Rr layers changes with the sun, with the maximum at noon. The remaining gambling layers are uncertain. The F2 layer can sometimes change by 50% in one quarter of an hour or even half a sentence in winter; the reflection ability of this layer is the largest around noon in winter and sunset in summer. The M layer is sometimes uncertain, and sometimes similar to the Er and Rrll layers.</p>
<p>In addition, the earth's magnetic field also has a considerable impact. Because in the geomagnetic field, the radio wave is affected and divided into two, and each is reflected at different points, so the same radio wave can have two different pseudo heights, as represented by the dotted line and the solid line in the fourth figure.</p>
<h3>Economic Exchange Loudspeaker Single Tube Machine</h3>
<p>— Cao Runsheng</p>
<p>Here to introduce a radio, it can be called the most economical in parts; the effect is good and worthy. The author can guarantee that the testers will not fail, if he can do it very carefully.</p>
<p>The environment was not very good when I tested this machine, but eight or nine radio stations have been clearly and loudly released in the loudspeaker one by one, so if there is a good environment, then its results must be very amazing!</p>
<p>The circuit is a kind of regenerative, but readers should not think that it is regenerative and dare not do it. You can just be bold and do it! Because this kind of regenerative is different from the ordinary, it is easy to manufacture and has a good effect. The author has several novice friends who have tried this circuit without a single failure. But having said that, inferior parts are still not available, and the results will definitely be bad!</p>
<p>Parts list:</p>
<p>LLLrL2 three-loop coil. Use 26-gauge enameled wire to wind on the spider web board, L four turns; L1 seventy turns; L2 thirty turns.</p>
<p>C·〇〇〇35Μfd variable capacitor.</p>
<p>C1·〇〇1Mfd fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>C2·1Mfd (high voltage resistant to 500 volts).</p>
<p>C3 1Mfd</p>
<p>C4C5 two Mfd</p>
<p>C6·〇〇〇〇5Mfd (small 13 pieces.)</p>
<p>R 350 merhm 50 watt fixed consumption resistance.</p>
<p>Rr 1,000 ohm fixed consumption resistance.</p>
<p>T five to one low week rate transformer.</p>
<p>AFC 303H 25MA low week rate choke.</p>
<p>S switch.</p>
<p>Vacuum tube 12A7 (this vacuum tube is already sold in Shanghai, and the price is also cheap, only three or four yuan).</p>
<p>Although this machine is AC, DC power can also be used, so the worry of DC power in the mainland can also be used. But DC has positive and negative, and it will not work if inserted incorrectly. So if you encounter silence, just insert Plak back.</p>
<p>Because this machine uses ore for detection, this ore must be sensitive, and inferior goods sold for one or two cents should not be used.</p>
<h3>Three-Screen Triode Vacuum Tube</h3>
<p>— Bubble</p>
<p>The advancement of vacuum tubes can be said to be endless. We have not yet fully understood recent developments such as the twelve-pin vacuum tube from Germany and the all-metal vacuum tube from General Electric in the United States. Now, a new type of vacuum tube has been announced in a British radio magazine (Practical and Amateur Wireless), manufactured by the world-renowned Mazda factory: the "Three-Screen Triode Vacuum Tube."</p>
<p>This three-screen triode vacuum tube contains three diode sections and one triode section within a single tube. Except for the filament and cathode, which are shared, the rest are completely independent. Therefore, it is effectively like using three diodes and one triode, allowing for extremely versatile applications. For example, it can be used for diode detection, noise suppression, automatic volume control, and triode audio frequency amplification, as shown in the attached diagram. Alternatively, two small screens can be used for full-wave detection, while the third small screen is used for automatic volume control. Or, one small screen can be connected to an ammeter as a tuning indicator to aid in tuning, while the remaining two small screens are used for detection and automatic volume control, and so on.</p>
<p>The filament of this vacuum tube requires four volts at one ampere, with a maximum screen voltage of 250 volts and a screen resistance of 13,000 ohms. The total amplification factor for diode detection and triode audio frequency amplification is 35.</p>
<h3>Aluminum Welding Method</h3>
<p>— Si Lian</p>
<p>There are many types of metals, and those commonly seen in radio applications include brass, copper, iron, and aluminum. Brass and copper are cheaper and have higher conductivity, so they are widely used in radio transmitters and receivers. Aluminum is typically used for chassis or transformer covers, or for low-frequency transformer shells.</p>
<p>The wiring in transmitters and receivers must be firmly soldered, otherwise their effectiveness and performance will be affected. This is well known to those who study radio. However, soldering different metal materials varies in difficulty. For example, soldering two copper wires together only requires adding some rosin and pressing the solder onto them. If the two copper wires have oxidized and developed verdigris, they should first be cleaned with sandpaper. While brass is more difficult to solder than copper, it is not difficult with the addition of a rosin oil. The most difficult is soldering aluminum materials; adding rosin, rosin oil, or dilute sulfuric acid is ineffective. So, what is the method?</p>
<p>According to an American magazine, the medium for soldering aluminum is an alloy. Once this alloy is made, it can only be used for soldering aluminum items and has no other use. The composition is as follows:</p>
<p>First, melt tin to a certain extent, then add charcoal powder and rosin (or wax). Stir until well mixed to prevent the tin surface from oxidizing due to contact with air. Then, prepare a small piece of magnesium and use pliers to insert it into the molten tin. Continuously stir until the magnesium is completely melted. The alloy is then complete and can be used to solder aluminum objects.</p>
<h3>Amateur Notes (Continued 1)</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>Static interference in radios remains a difficult problem that is impossible to completely avoid. Although researchers work tirelessly day and night, burying themselves in their work, preparing to explore a perfect fundamental solution, they have not yet reached a state of complete success.</p>
<p>Regarding static interference, the various so-called avoidance methods are actually only passive remedies and do not constitute thorough reforms. However, "something is better than nothing." Although the effect is small, it is still worth trying.</p>
<p>One type of static interference is generated by atmospheric static electricity due to discharge, commonly known as atmospheric electrical interference. In addition to shortening the radio's antenna, adding a tone control can also weaken it.</p>
<p>Man-made static interference, such as from electric motors and medical electrotherapy devices, is caused by the radio waves they emit. A common remedy is to use an isolated or underground antenna. This applies to the radio's power input section. Although this method is good, it may not be practical due to material and installation considerations.</p>
<p>If a filter is added to the power input of the machine that generates the interference nearby, the effect will be significant, as most of the interference transmitted through the power line can be eliminated. However, the difficulty lies in whether permission can be obtained from the owner in advance!</p>
<p>Figure 2A shows the circuit for this filter. L is a high-frequency choke coil, which can be made by winding 100 turns of No. 14 double-yarn-wrapped wire on a one-and-a-half-inch diameter tube. C is an eight-microfarad fixed capacitor (which must withstand 750 volts). F is a fuse to prevent accidental danger in the event of a short circuit in capacitor C.</p>
<p>AC radios often also use the above filter to reduce noise and AC hum transmitted from the power supply. However, this method is quite dangerous. It is safer to use indirect isolation, as shown by the dotted line in Figure 2B. This involves separating the primary and secondary windings of the power transformer with a metal sheet (such as lead foil) and grounding it. This isolation must be absolutely well-insulated from the primary and secondary windings. If a metal sheet is not used, a layer of No. 28 wire can be wound, with one end unconnected and the other end connected to the ground wire instead.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Enemies and Good Friends</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Recently, due to the cooperation of international war veterans, the atmosphere of Franco-German compromise has gradually become stronger. The other day, a delegation of German veterans visited Paris and was warmly welcomed by French veterans. Oberlindober, the chairman of the German delegation, told a Havas News Agency reporter: "Yesterday we were enemies, today we are comrades, and tomorrow we will be good friends." This statement is very frank.</p>
<p>France and Germany have always been arch-enemies, hence the saying: Yesterday we were enemies. Now, veterans from both countries are meeting for the first time in Paris to promote closer ties, hence the saying: Today we are comrades. In the future, if a compromise between the two countries can be achieved, they can turn enemies into friends, hence the saying: Tomorrow we will be good friends.</p>
<p>International relations are purely based on the shifting of interests and gains. If the interests and gains of two countries conflict, they are regarded as enemies. Conversely, if the interests and gains of two countries are harmonized, they become close friends. There is no morality involved. The strategies adopted by various countries in the world today, such as allying with A to restrain B and uniting with C to resist D, are all determined by interests and gains.</p>
<p>For example, today's international situation is extremely complex, making it difficult to discern who is whose friend and who is whose enemy. Are France and Russia not two incompatible countries? Not long ago, however, they signed the Franco-Russian Agreement and became comrades. For a period of time, Germany and Italy were not very close and connected? Recently, however, they have gone their separate ways and do not interfere with each other. As for France and Germany, the depth of their hatred has only increased since the Great War. But now they are also in the process of compromising, seemingly abandoning old grievances and forming good friends. What is the reason for this? It is the relationship of interests and gains.</p>
<p>We welcome the Franco-German compromise. If this can be achieved, it cannot be immediately regarded as a guarantee of world peace. But at least the disputes in Europe can be resolved by half. However, since international relations are purely based on the shifting of interests and gains, it is difficult to guarantee that France and Germany, which are approaching each other today due to interests and gains, will not break up again tomorrow due to interests and gains.</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>The continuous rain of the past few days has filled the ditches in the Jinjiabu area, and the rice seedlings in the fields at various heights have all turned green. The water in the river has risen by several feet, and those low-lying fields are indeed in some danger.</p>
<p>Father Yongsheng has been worrying again these few days. He is afraid that he has avoided the drought but cannot escape the flood. Moreover, the flood is even more terrible than the drought!</p>
<p>Although it is now July, the weather still feels like a late spring season. At night, one must wrap oneself tightly in a quilt on the bed, but still feels a bit cold in the second half of the night. This phenomenon is definitely not something that occurs in the height of summer. Therefore, everyone anticipates in their hearts that this is a sign of a major flood.</p>
<p>Today, just as the sky was barely dawning, when Father Yongsheng saw a few strands of grayish-white dawn light seeping in through the cracks in the roof tiles, he jumped up from his bed. Thinking of the heavy rain that had fallen all night, he was certain that many low-lying fields must have been flooded, and he was afraid that the few mu of land he had planted in Lujiabang would not be spared. So, he got out of bed and walked out of a dark room, seeing that the leaking roof in several places had turned the main room into a small river. The low-lying areas of the mud floor had already accumulated several inches of water.</p>
<p>"This house is too old. In a few years, if it's not repaired, it won't be habitable anymore!" He sighed to himself, stepping on the dry patches of mud one by one, walked to the edge of the courtyard, looked up at the sky, and the sky still wore a gloomy face, without showing any trace of color. As soon as he went out, he happened to run into Wang Shenfa from the neighboring village, who was also going to check on his own fields.</p>
<p>"Father Yongsheng, you're up early too! How are the fields? Your fields should be alright, right!" Father Yongsheng had indeed gotten up particularly early today, but who knew that he hadn't closed his eyes all night! He was listening to the sound of dripping rain, which seemed even scarier than the sound of a machine gun! Wang Shenfa, because he rarely saw Father Yongsheng get up so early, asked him that question.</p>
<p>"Alright? Ha! I think if it goes on like this, in less than half a month, everyone's fields will be in trouble. Are you going to check on the seedlings now too?" Father Yongsheng replied.</p>
<p>"What's the use of looking? What's flooded is already flooded, and it's still going to rain. Do you think the sky will clear up soon?" Wang Shenfa said, pointing at the sky.</p>
<p>"It's not a problem yet, because the water in the Chu River is small, so although the low-lying areas are not completely flooded, if it rains for a few more days, we're finished!"</p>
<p>"One year of drought, one year of flood, we villagers only have one way to die!"</p>
<p>"Hey! When it's dry, not a drop falls, and when it rains, it's endless..."</p>
<p>"Stop talking! I heard San Ye say yesterday that in Hankou and many other places, you can even row boats in the streets!"</p>
<p>"Good! If we don't die early from starvation, we'll drown. We'll all escape death sooner or later!" As Father Yongsheng said this, his emotions were so enraged that the blue veins on his forehead almost burst out with blood.</p>
<p>The two of them walked and talked, their footsteps especially heavy. At this time, everyone was carrying a heart of</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>depression, walking towards the embankment of the riverbank. Both of their faces were equally tightly stretched, and it was almost impossible to find a lively spot on their faces.</p>
<p>When they reached a camphor tree, they parted ways. Each stepped onto the edge of their own fields, seeing that the fields of others were also flooded with water, just an inch or so away from completely submerging all the seedlings. A slight breeze blew, and very beautiful waves would rise in the fields, looking extremely like a river surface from a distance. The green seedlings bowed their backs in an orderly manner on the muddy yellow water surface, weaving a regular net.</p>
<p>Father Yongsheng stood on the bank of his own field, staring in a daze at the field that he had planted with so much hard work for more than half a month, after longing for rain for a month, thinking that his field was now somewhat unreliable and dangerous!</p>
<p>It started to rain again in the sky, not very hard, but still significant:</p>
<p>"Ah! It's going to rain again!!!" In the heart of everyone in Jinjiabu, the same terrifying cry echoed!</p>
<h3>Crippled Zhang San</h3>
<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>Zhang San, who lived next door to us, died after his leg unfortunately bitten by a venomous snake while cutting firewood on the mountain that June, and rotted for three whole years.</p>
<p>Ever since his leg ulcerated, the villagers called him "Crippled Zhang San." Although he didn't like it, he couldn't stop people from calling him that. But when the children passed in front of him and also called him "Crippled Zhang San" instead of Uncle Zhang, he wouldn't care if he didn't hear it, but if he did, he would immediately change his normal state, and furiously say: "Damn it, you son of a bitch, what does my rotten leg have to do with you little brats... you uneducated little brats, you little bastards..." Unpleasant words would spew out of his mouth. But the children, knowing that he couldn't chase them, would continue to scold him: "You'll rot to death, you stinky Zhang San, you'll rot to death tomorrow," and then run away from him. Zhang San would angrily watch them, and sometimes, when he was extremely angry, he would throw his two crutches at them, but not only could he not hit them, the crutches would often be taken away by them. As a result, Zhang San could only swallow his anger and say some nice words to them, asking them to return the crutches to him.</p>
<p>Every day, Zhang San would suffer from the bullying of these mischievous children.</p>
<p>The day Zhang San's leg was bitten by a snake, he had just been married to his wife for a month. His wife was very young, very beautiful, and very flirtatious. Before Zhang San's leg was bitten by a snake, his wife was unwilling to be with him, and after his leg was bitten, his wife used his leg as an excuse and separated from him in bed, secretly sleeping with Zhang San's uncle, Zhang Taiye. Although Zhang San knew his wife's behavior, after his leg was injured, he could no longer cut firewood and go to the city to exchange it for money to support himself and his wife. The family's living expenses all depended on his uncle's supply, so he never dared to expose their secret.</p>
<p>In the third year that Zhang San's leg rotted, his wife gave birth to a child who looked exactly like Zhang Taiye. As a result, the news spread like wildfire, and within two days, everyone in the village knew that Zhang San's wife had given birth to a child who looked just like Zhang Taiye.</p>
<p>"Crippled Zhang San, your luck is really good, you had a child without spending any effort."</p>
<p>"Crippled Zhang San, your child looks just like your great-uncle."</p>
<p>Every day, Zhang San would hear these mocking words. When he heard them, he would just lower his head, not make a sound, and his face would turn red.</p>
<p>The mischievous children in the village no longer called Zhang San "Crippled Zhang San" now. They had also changed their address and called him "Crippled Turtle." Zhang San no longer got as angry and cursed them as he used to. He also lowered his head, didn't make a sound, and his face turned red.</p>
<p>When the child turned one month old, Zhang Taiye sent out many invitations to guests in advance. The invitations openly stated that it was his own child being celebrated. Everyone in the village was afraid of Zhang Taiye's wealth and power, and no one dared to say a word. On the day of the full moon celebration, nine-tenths of the entire village came to congratulate Zhang Taiye. But, strangely, no one could see Zhang San that day. Most people guessed that Zhang San was hiding away in shame.</p>
<p>The next day, two people carried a very thin coffin out of Zhang San's house.</p>
<p>—It turned out that Zhang San had hanged himself in the room where he slept on the day of the child's full moon celebration.</p>
<h3>Daydreaming Words</h3>
<p>— Xia Yin</p>
<p>(1) I Understand Myself</p>
<p>Who can help but sigh for their own life? When the black hand of the century snatched away the golden childhood and the dreams of happiness, the remaining days, this gray haze, like a withered and sick patient, gradually eroded all the grand ambitions in life. Who can help but slowly feel a terrible tremor at this terrible depression, firmly piercing the heart?</p>
<p>Alas, for the life before me, I can only let out a helpless sigh.</p>
<p>I do not believe that life is a mysterious thing. I see myself very clearly; I am also very clear about people. Although the days are a long string of coming and going; going and coming again, there is never a time to reach the end; a person's life, however, is following the passing of the days, crawling towards the path of aging and destruction. What can brilliant and precious achievements be worth? The black hand of the century can grab you anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>I am sometimes very surprised, how can a young person enter this negative wasteland—a chronic suicide of self-abandonment. But, I also quickly understand. Rather than saying this is negativity towards life, it is more accurate to say that it is a reaction stimulated in the sentiment towards the vague and gray life before us. Isn't it? In my own life, where are there any signs of aging and dusk inlaid?</p>
<p>———A tender sprout that has just emerged from the soil, if there is no sunlight and rain to give it warmth and moisture, its life will only be forever pale and forever fragile.</p>
<p>I thoroughly understand this sentence, I thoroughly understand. I understand myself.</p>
<p>(2) Can Only Sigh at Life</p>
<p>I once made a vow facing the red sunrise, I said that I would carefully cherish my young life, waiting for it to bloom a bright flower, under the magnificent sunlight, so that I could forever bathe in laughter and spend my days.</p>
<p>Since making this vow, my heart seems to have brightened a bit, like a lone boat thrown into the sea at night, suddenly seeing the lighthouse on the other shore in despair. I suppressed all my resentment, like a camel, steadying my steps, pushing the axis of life, enduring all the hardships of life, not sighing, not groaning, trekking through the Gobi Desert where the wind and sand are rolling. Yes, under all these hardships, I believe in my own patience, waiting for my young life to bloom a bright flower under the magnificent sunlight.</p>
<p>At that time, I forgot all the difficulties? I couldn't see all the ugliness of the world; I wasn't afraid of the storms and cold in front of me: the scorching sun in the rain. I only focused on my own patience, struggling. Therefore, people constantly threw all the beautiful words of praise at me, kind and malicious, I accepted them all with a nod. They all said that a person's happiness is piled up with sweat and blood, patience, and obedience.</p>
<p>However, year after year passed, time increased my wisdom; the awakening of doubt made me gradually lift up my heavy head, and then I saw clearly everything around me, I understood that all my past efforts of patience were in vain, rushing towards emptiness; I could not see the flower blooming from my life; I began to sigh at life; I originally used my vow to deceive myself!</p>
<p>Although, I am still young, and I have the passion to shake the earth. It is just the disillusionment of reality that has caused this wounded heart to slowly shed a lot of blood.</p>
<p>Can life never bloom a bright flower? Alas, now I can only sigh at life.</p>
<h3>Physiology and Anatomy Class</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianshe</p>
<p>The first class on Monday is Dr. Wu's physiology and anatomy class. In medical school, this course attracts the attention of students and makes them feel interested. When discussing the function of gastric mucus, we learned about the manufacturing method of soda water. This time, when discussing blood pressure, we also got the opportunity to test blood pressure.</p>
<p>In the summer weather, the classroom is filled with a temperature of 85 degrees, showing a restless situation. Writing pads, lecture note folders, handkerchiefs… all serve as temporary fans. But not a single person is missing from the classroom. If it were another class, would we be polite? Surely a third of the people would have sneaked off to the Hui'erkang Ice Cream Parlor. Especially the nine female students. In the summer, female students often eat ice cream as a meal. Do I really suspect that their sensitivity to heat is stronger than that of men?</p>
<p>Dr. Wu wore a white canvas suit, a white shirt, and a white tie today, setting off a white and intelligent forehead, with a gentle and interesting smile, orderly taking out the instruments for checking blood pressure, lecture notes, and explanatory charts from his briefcase. As usual, he puffed out his chest and threw away his smile.</p>
<p>"We have already explained the movement and function of blood in the human body very clearly. Blood flow and river flow are the same principle. The flow at the source is very rapid. Gradually going down, the speed decreases. When it reaches the tributaries—the capillaries—it flows even more slowly, like a pool of spring water…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he drew a diagram of the arterial system on the blackboard, constantly wiping the sweat on his forehead, his nose twitching, as if he was afraid of chalk dust getting into his nostrils.</p>
<p>"Dr. Wu, is chalk dust harmful to the human body? You said last time that cotton lint is harmful to the lungs." Tao Xianbing, a female student in the fifth row, asked this question deliberately in a joking manner. The faces of the entire class were revealed with a hint of sarcasm by this question, and forty-three pairs of eyes were fixed on Dr. Wu's face, which was carrying three points of pity. The climate around the podium seemed to have cooled down a lot. He still maintained his original attitude and said:</p>
<p>"How can it not be harmful! Whether to the eyes, the forehead, the lungs, mineral powder, but…</p>
<p>What he couldn't say below—</p>
<p>"This is my life!" Stuck in his throat, he coughed up a mouthful of phlegm into the spittoon. It wasn't phlegm, it was the acidic and bitter liquid of life: saliva. If it had been a month ago, he would have suspected that he was spitting blood again. He had suffered from hemoptysis, with blood pressure exceeding 160. He had performed a tuberculosis test himself, planting the tuberculosis reaction vaccine on his arm… what a weak person he was. He dared not admit to strangers that he was a physiology professor. In a moment of deep thought…</p>
<p>"Hurry up and check our blood pressure… are you trying to muddle through another class again…"</p>
<p>Although they were just a few soft sentences, each tone was like a needle tip, pricking every valve in his ventricle. He put the chalk into the tinplate basin, shifted his ashamed gaze to look at the healthy students under the podium, every face with rosy cheeks, smiled and said:</p>
<p>"I see that everyone's blood pressure is generally not pathological. If you want to be tested, you can come up, hehe…"</p>
<p>So, one strong arm after another passed under his 250-degree Zeiss Punk lenses, and on the record book: Li Jian rr5-65, Wang Lingqing ro8-6., Hu Zhongyu 120-70… all OK.</p>
<p>After the bell rang for the end of class, he patted the chalk dust on his shoulders, dragging his tired body to walk out.</p>

<p>Radio Station: Eastern (1020) 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Emotion"</p>
<p>The word 'emotion' is the most difficult to express. Its meaning, when spoken of, is quite profound. Without emotion, Heaven and Earth could not create. Without emotion, the Sun and Moon would not shine brightly. Without emotion, things would not grow and flourish. Without emotion, how could mankind survive? It's a pity that the world generally discusses emotion inappropriately, only knowing that love between two sexes constitutes emotion. Therefore, the application of emotion is not broad. Favoritism and partiality indulged selfishly. One must understand that Heaven and Earth impartially cover and sustain, and the Sun and Moon impartially illuminate. The emotional lake is vast and without leaks, and thus seems emotionless. Therefore, it is said that compassion without affection is the greatest emotion, and transcending emotion is the deepest emotion. In ancient times, there was Emperor Yao of the Tang Dynasty, whose virtue was as great as Heaven, unfathomable to man. Those mortals are generally incapable, so they can only discuss the depth of emotion, and also must see if emotion is false or true. Deep emotion is like a pool of spring water, immeasurably profound. Shallow emotion is like a wisp of autumn cloud, a light silk. True emotion is where one treads fire and plunges into boiling water without hesitation. False emotion is where oaths on mountains and seas are merely empty words. It is truly a pity to throw oneself into the net of emotion. Losing in the arena of emotion is the most heartbreaking. Breaking apart lovers leads to resentment. Exposing love letters brings about shameful notoriety. Such uses of emotion are mostly improper. Proper emotion is something they instead don't care about. To the extent that, with flesh and blood relatives killing each other, where is the emotion? Even birth parents are hurt by emotion. Though not comparable to inanimate objects that feel no pain, they are mostly ungrateful and heartless people. And they still speak of a world of great harmony and celebrate peace.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Ouyang Yuqian Talks to a Newspaper Reporter</h3>
<p>Since Ouyang Yuqian directed "The Peach Blossom Fan," he goes to the Xinhua Studio on Xietu Road every day, working exceptionally diligently. A few days ago, he published a great discussion about "The Peach Blossom Fan," and every newspaper praised him. Yesterday, a reporter from a certain newspaper went to ask him questions and talked to him. He again published the following great discussion: "Although drama and film have many common and similar points, they are absolutely different arts. Therefore, directors each have their own techniques, each their own experiences and specializations. A drama director may not be able to direct films, and a film director may not be able to direct drama." He also said, "Whether it is drama or film, it is always necessary to pay attention to the unity and harmony of the entire piece, so rhythm and cadence are most important. Any work whose overall flow is not smooth is definitely incompletely organized, and it will never be unified. If it is not unified, it will never be harmonious. Conversely, if it is not harmonious, it will never be unified." He also said, "After the director has read the script, he should judge what effect he can achieve on the screen with his own strength. At the same time, he should carefully check whether the division of scenes is appropriate, whether there are contradictions before and after the division of shots, and correct them with keen eyes and experienced skills. Then, with an extremely fair mind, he should make a clear choice of actors." Using this theory to direct "The Peach Blossom Fan," that "The Peach Blossom Fan" will definitely have amazing results.</p>
<h3>Dentsu Highlights</h3>
<p>Dentsu recently acquired two dogs, one named Malai, a short-legged Pomeranian with the air of a small lion. The other, named Tona, is black and white, understands human speech, and has both been on camera.</p>
<p>Cartoonist Cai Ruohong has also been on camera in "City Scenery," and has been asked to drive a car. Currently, Dentsu's chauffeurs take turns instructing him morning and evening. The actions of starting and stopping the car, etc., are already very natural for him.</p>
<p>Set designer Zhang Yunqiao has many unique ideas for the sets at the studio. The exterior of the studio in "Peach and Plum Calamity" and "Children of the Storm" are both extremely realistic. Recently, in "City Scenery," he has delved even deeper into depicting the interior of the studio.</p>
<p>Since Dentsu Pictorial started offering prizes in its third issue, sales have greatly increased. The letters guessing the prizes arrive daily in the hundreds, keeping the staff of Dentsu Pictorial Society busy and overwhelmed.</p>
<h3>Dentsu's Standards for Recruiting Actors</h3>
<p>See the Fifth Issue of Dentsu Pictorial for Details</p>
<p>Shanghai Dentsu Film Studio, in order to recruit knowledgeable women who aspire to the screen and to select new talents, will publish a prescribed application form in the fifth issue of "Dentsu Bi-Monthly Pictorial," to be published on July 16th. The criteria and standards are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Height: 60 to 65 inches. (2) Language: Able to use accurate Mandarin or Peking dialect. (3) Pronunciation: No tracheal disease or hoarse voice. (4) Weight: From 105 to 125 pounds.

<h3>"Time of Blooming Youth" Public Screening</h3>
<p>"Time of Blooming Youth" is a masterpiece by the famous American female writer Jenore Crffee, comparable to Connie Hedder, author of "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain," who specializes in female psychology. The entire play is based on various phenomena in modern society, and it offers considerable clarification and inspiration regarding the maintenance of emotions between young couples, mutual comfort and assistance, the decline of public knowledge, the sorrow caused by vanity, and the distorted pathology of conflicts of interest and the battle between good and evil caused by the power of money. It also provides a profound dissection. The leading actors, such as Paul Rogar, Maggie Evans, Melo Robertson, Helen Vinson, David Jack Holt (a rising genius among child stars), and Ralph Forbes, are all excellent choices. It is currently being screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater. Below is Helen and David as mother and son.</p>
