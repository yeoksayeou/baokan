<p>（東京）海軍軍縮問題自去年十二月豫備會商决裂以後、完全停頓、而最近歐洲政局大動搖、英國主張邀請德俄參加軍縮會議、美國則希望延期開會、其情形漸次複雜、日海軍當局重視前途、査最近關於海軍軍縮會議之各種情形、大體如下、</p>
<p>（一）歐州各國海軍勢力之比較、</p>
<p>英國一百二十五萬噸、法國六十六萬噸、意大利四十二萬噸、蘇俄二十一萬噸、德國十一萬噸、</p>
<p>蘇俄雖比德國多一倍、然德國軍艦殆係新式、故勢力相等、</p>
<p>（二）德國欲獲得英國海軍備之三成五分、（卽四十四萬噸）然英國因恐北海方面勢力不及、擬加反對、但因空軍及其他關係、英國不能不承認德國獲得一成五分、</p>
<p>（三）法國最恐德國軍備之擴大、如英國承認德國保有二十餘萬噸、則法國亦擴張勢力、俾得對抗、</p>
<p>（四）英國邀請德俄參加會議之目的、似係打開其苦境、然其前途、對於歐洲政局有重大關係、並可支配軍縮會議命運、（二十九日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）德國再建海軍及於本屆軍縮正式會議之影響、日本海軍當局對此所抱見解如下、英國若承認德國對英三成五分四十四萬噸之要求、則將與英國勢力相等、故必拒絕其要求、此蓋英國最近漸由二國標準主義、轉換爲三國標凖主義之意、卽對德國若承認四十四萬噸、則合計法國之六十六萬噸、意大利之四十二萬噸、共達百五十二萬噸、勢將凌駕英國保有量之百二十五萬噸、而根本推翻三國標準、故三成五分必不肯與以承認、由此以觀、英國必反對减至現在之保有量以下、其事至明、故對日本政府之軍縮根本方針、所謂務必規定最大共通保有量而縮少保有量之舉、亦將陷於不能應允之地位也、法國向主張對德優勢、　歌華府條約狀態者、加以美國固持已說、故下屆軍縮會議照歐洲各國目下之狀勢、益無成功之望、（二十九日電通社電）</p>

<p>整理平漢粵漢兩路之進行　完成滬杭甬並興建蘇嘉路</p>
<p>中央社云、鐵道部次長曾仲鳴、於日前由京抵滬、與金融界接洽整理鐵部舊債事宜、中央社記者、昨晨訪之於其私寓、詢以關於鐵部修建各路事宜、承吿甚詳、分誌如次、</p>
<p>接洽整理舊債</p>
<p>曾氏首謂、此次來滬、係與上海金融界接洽整理鐵部　價、並籌集經費、以造新路、在滬尙有一二日之勾留、卽行返京、至於鐵道部長顧孟餘氏、因病請假療養、迄已數月、茲悉顧氏疾病、現已吿痊、在平再作一個月勾留、卽行南返、逕赴廬由暫住、蓋顧氏軀質素極孱弱也、</p>
<p>路股海外奇漲</p>
<p>全國各鐵路股票、銷售於海外市塲上甚夥、最近之年來、因各路業務之發展、信用日好、股票價格亦日漸上漲、目下股票價格、與三年前相較、竟有高漲至三四倍至五六倍者、例如前售二十六鎊之股票、現已漲至九十六鎊、三十鎊之股票、現已漲一百零一）鎊不等、</p>
<p>整理兩路計劃</p>
<p>曾氏次談整理平漢粵漢兩路計劃云、平漢路之整理、現已着手進行、鐵部以黄河鐵橋建築已久、故由鐵路專家、會同黄河水利委員會硏究辦法、而認該處河面較闊、地質較鬆、有另選地段建造之必要、據估價約需欵二三千萬元、至於粵漢鐵路、現已分段建造、約於明年十二月間可以通車、</p>
<p>完成滬杭甬路</p>
<p>滬杭甬鐵路之完成、亦已積極進行、錢塘江鐵橋、已由鐵道部與浙江建設廳動工興建、明年可以完工、第二步卽將與建曹娥江鐵橋、至於隴海鐵路延長路錢、其計劃亦已决定、先延長自西安至蘭州一段、蘇（蘇州）嘉（嘉興）鐵路之典建、亦爲鐵道部計劃興建新路之一也、</p>

<p>一　國內經濟好轉之曙光</p>
<p>國內經濟、受國外通貨膨脹之壓迫、與統制經濟之影饗、貨物則鉅額入超、白銀則鉅額出超、景象衰頽、旣如上述、然而一年之內、所以應付此環境而爲之防衛調節、曁所以從事於建設之內部工作者、公私經濟事業、亦略有好轉之可期、姑列數端如下、</p>
<p>（一）關於財政及建設之事項（甲）公偵庫券、前經整理者、本息均如期償付、本年發行者、連外幣曁各省在內、約共二萬二千萬元、地方債券、尤爲建設救災爲主、（乙）全國賦稅、均經整理、關鹽稅並經改訂、廢除之苛捐雜稅、巳達三千六百餘種、（丙）重要之建設事業、如導淮·治河·引渭。以及浦口輪波·錢塘江橋·等工程、或巳完成或已動工、機器酒精·硫酸錏·等工廠、均次第舉辦、鋼鐵及新聞紙廠、亦巳着手籌備、此致力於公私經濟之基礎工作者也、</p>
<p>（二）關於貨幣及匯兌之事項（甲）整理幣鈔、財政部有私幣私票之禁令、（乙）管理匯兌、有白銀出口稅及平衡稅之實施、又有平滙基金外滙平市及幣制等委員會之先後設立、此外又禁止標金投機、並改由中央銀行按日核定外滙揖牌行市、成效雖未大著、而貸幣統一及滙兌管理等辦法、固已肇其端矣、</p>
<p>（三）關於交通及運輸之事項（甲）鐵路工程、較重要者杭江延至南昌、隴海展至西安、株韶銜接粵漢、淮南築至合肥、京詔趕築京蕪一段、均在積極進行、足以聯絡都市內地之交通、便利貨物之運輸、（乙）公路工程、較重要者、七省聯絡公路、全長二萬二千餘公里、已通車者三千二百九十餘公里（經濟委員會公路處十二月份表報）西北三省公路、甘肅靑海共長一萬餘里、寗夏則南至　遠、北至臨河、或已完成、或在修築、此外如河北福建以及其他各省、自造公路、據調査亦在三萬公里以上、尤便於內地之交通、與土產之運銷、（關於電話之改進茲姑從略（丙）運輸事業、經改良者、京滬平浦隴海等路之貨物聯運、均已舉辦、負責運輸、亦巳實行、鐵路營　所之經售土產、尤爲土貨產銷、開、捷徑、比便於貨物之運輸者也、</p>
<p>（四）關於生產及運銷之事項（甲）國貨生產方面、廣東輕重工業、多已舉辦、棉布紙張等輕工業產品、輸人减少、此類國貨、不無抬頭之望、（乙）產銷統制工作、絲繭棉紗、均見統制委員會之組織、（丙）合作事業、據中央農業實騐所調查、全國共有合作社一四·六四九所、信用合作社、占百分之七六强、管營生產運銷者占百分之八·九、此其結果、通過碼頭雖不免衰落、中間商人亦失其利益、而於改良國貨之產銷、爲效匪細也、</p>
<p>（五）關於金融業務之事項（甲）儲蓄銀行法、業經頒布、儲欵準備、亦經規定（乙）各銀行增設之分支行、冬向內地推進、兼辦農業貸欵、資金漸向農村回流、（丙）都市錢莊多銀行化、內地銀行多向附近村鎭分設辦事處、人亦謂之銀行之錢莊化、（丁）各銀行共同合作事業、對政府之建設救災等借欵、全年將近一萬三千萬元、對同業之合作互助、除聯合準備及票據交換外、或協同貸欽、或合辦副業、均以齊一步調、防免競爭爲主義、此金融業務之改善者也、</p>
<p>此外如剿匪工作之勝利、陝豫局面之安定、江北河北西北等之豐收、固堪稱幸、而債券行市、大勢趨漲、終年無劇烈之波動、亦可見人心之日漸鎭定、說者謂關於統制管理金融、組織同業合作等改善事項、於今巳漸見端倪、即如抵柙制度之逐漸推行、生產事業之與運輸銷費相接近、未始非經濟界漸見好轉之現象焉、</p>
<p>如右所述、雖不過改善工作之起點、然實爲經濟界熹徵之曙光、譬諸積病之人、果能營衛得宜、大可期其好轉、以銀行之立塲、維持輔助。因勢利導·固宜各盡其相當之責任、而本行負有發展實業之使命、尤不能不努力圖之、過去一年中之工作、尙有相當成績、尤幸銀行同業、現已由各個競爭、轉向同一陣綫、共同合作、盡服務社會之職、此又同業間之一種好轉現象、未始不可樂觀者、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c170">粵中大高中反對會考　學生罷課形勢嚴重 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>鄒魯昨開校董會將首事學生除名　學生態度堅决教應決遵法令行事</p>
<p>（廣州訊）粵國立中山大學髙中二十四年級學生三百餘人、近因反對參加敎育廳髙中畢業會考、致自二十七日起釀成全體學生罷課風潮、而校方及廳方態度亦異常堅决、校方且於昨日（二十九）召集校董會議、擬開除爲首滋事學生、並限附中全體學生即日復課、風潮恐將愈擴愈大、茲將探得詳情、分　於下、</p>
<p>高中組織</p>
<p>中大附中原由該校預科改組而來、十九年停招預科生、改招髙中二年級生、二十年秋並將該校附中之髙中各級併入合辦、及添招一年生、遂成立髙中部已有四年歷史、髙中部學制係採取學年制、將普通課程分爲甲乙兩組、凡學生志願將來肄業大學文法兩科者、習甲組科程、其志願將來肄業理工醫農各科者、習乙組課程、且爲注重養成乙組人材起見、二十二年度錄取新生、甲組與乙組爲一與六之比、二十三年度則爲一與二之比、數年以來、該校因課程與性質較其他高中不同、且學生畢業後、又大多即升入本校大學部繼續深造、故對於政府歷屆舉辦之會考、均未參加、</p>
<p>風潮原因</p>
<p>近敎育部爲謀統一高中學生畢業會考起見、特通令各省敎廳及國立各大學、凡國省市立高中或附屬高中、均一律須參加該省最高敎宵行政機關主辦之畢業會考以昭劃一、粵敎應奉令後、當即轉函中山査照、並請將本年上學期之髙中學生名冊送廳、以便屆期編號、學校當局以此係政府命令、且中大附中因歷年不參加會考被外界攻擊爲學生程度低陋故不敢參加云云、爲遵行政府法令及表示學生能力計、學校當局决定於六月參加會考、</p>
<p>學生反對</p>
<p>中大附中學生得悉後、即十日舉行臨時會議、僉以髙中課程旣與各同、數年來從未參加、今突然有此舉動、無何决不參加、同時並擬定一辦法、因不參加畢業會考充其量不過不能升入其他大學但本校大學部、應准予升入、當以此種意見、請校校畏接納、迨校長鄒魯表示拒絕、乃全體學生三百餘人、自二十七日起發表宣言、實行罷課、</p>
<p>校長態度</p>
<p>校長鄒魯接得學生方面要求後、當即表示不能接受、因畢業會考係全國敎育之事係校外之事、非校內之事、惟會考期定六月、巳逼在眉睫校方惟有服從政府命令舉行、敎廳舉行高中學生會考時、各生參加與否、任彼等自由、設假定各生不參加會考僅在本校考試及格、能否直接升入大學校、現實不能决定、及學生議决罷課、鄒氏除將一切情形陳報西南政務委員會及校董會外、並定二十九日舉行校董會、商議應付之具體辦法、至於敎廳方面、表示惟依照政府命令、學生參加與否、聽其自然、决置不理云、</p>

<p>從前德國俾斯麥說；今所恃者，唯白鐵赤血而已。」這話說得何等雄壯和透澈，但野心者的殘忍政策，却巳暴露靡遺！</p>
<p>「失敗爲成功之母」，這是勗勉人們，在一件事物失敗後，更須勇往直前，始終不懈的繼續研究，自有達到成功之一日，倘然偶因失敗，就要灰心，那末「成功之母」一語，等於廢話！</p>

<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>家裏在蠶事尙未忙碌以前，茶葉是這時期的一種小小的出產，合家大小忙碌地採摘着烘乾了賣錢，一部份的家用全要持着賣掉了的錢來貼補這荒春三的季節的。</p>
<p>每處果木樹的園邊，都種植着枝葉鳥茂的茶樹，在村裏可說沒有人家比得上我家的那末茂盛，人站在裏邊採茶外面可看不不到人。這些，全是祖母幾十年來的心血呵，伊老人家總是經騐地關心着；一年一次的用柴灰下肥，跟樹枝老得怎麼年度須砍掉，而使根邊再生出繁密的芽苗來。</p>
<p>在孩子時於　　是感到滿高興的，因爲小手腳採得快捷的原故，總會比大人採得多，所以常會阻着到學校去上課，一連總是十幾天。</p>
<p>每天早上跟着祖母，母親合金姐們，頸邊都掛了竹絲籃，上山去採茶了，與奮地臉上堆着笑，拖着輕捷的步子，鞋襪上沾着春草上的露珠，聽着林裏和悅的鳥聲，邊走邊看着東方朝旭漸漸地髙升。</p>
<p>採茶時母親們總會談着家裏沒有聽見過的話，咱却獨個兒唱着不合調的山歌</p>
<p>這情景似是一刹那間的時分呵，現在咱已自兩個孩子的爸爸了。、祖母已在五年前去世了，金姐是會了採茶，樹上手指碰到了一條蛇而嚇得害了重病而死的，每年這茶市將落的時節，母親總是在金姐忌日的那天，眼珠子哭得腫腫的。</p>
<p>現在這些兒茂盛的茶樹，祗有母親獨個兒起早磨晚的採了，這邊園裏採完，那邊園裏的茶芽已放「槍」了，所以採下來的茶芽烘製好是比不上人家的細而賣不起錢。</p>
<h3 id="c198">鉋王瓜兒 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>鉋王瓜兒這是杭州人一句土語，上海人打話「敲竹槓」，北方人所說的「訛詐」是也。別地人一到杭州別句話兒都不懂，那「鉋王瓜」一語·總會學得的，而且也會領悟的。</p>
<p>「王瓜人人怕鉋」，可是外地人一到杭州，總免不得給他們鉋上一鉋。實在也無可怪的，杭州的市面一年全靠三春，倘使不在那些遊春的公子哥兒小姐太太們身上，或是那些身掛黄布袋口唸阿彌陀的善果信女身上，鉋它一鉋，呌他們喝西北風過活麼？</p>
<p>話又說回來了，近年來杭州劃爲我國的風景區、一切建設，在在顯著特殊的進步，這「鉋王瓜」的惡習，到底也革除了不少。從前遊杭的人，最容易當王瓜鉋的，便是雇船和坐車坐轎幾件事，現下杭州市政府規定了一定的價目，豎立在通衢，外地人一望而知，便也不再上當了。像呌划子盪湖，從前五六元一天也有，十元八元一天也有，現在却規定了一元五角一天，半天一元，每小時二角，人們却稱便了。還有吃的方面，爲着市面不景氣，各飯舖都備着經濟客飯，那又呆板而不會鉋王瓜的。至於住呢，旅館在這幾個月內是賣實價的，不過定價比上海便宜，小賬却又不亞於上海</p>
<p>到杭州去的人，總喜歡買些杭州士產，像張小全的剪刀，舒連記的扇子，汪裕泰的茶葉，那是牌子字號，不會十分抬高價値的，不過您去買那藕粉，榧子，橄欖等東西，一不留心，王瓜兒便鉋進了。</p>

<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>他聽說我是來參觀的，又看看我身上穿的，腳上穿的，他疑心我是省委考査成績來了，趕快進去報吿，把校長和敎員請了出來。在理，小學生都是偌大年紀，敎員應該是一個老頭子，對的。可是走出來了，又是意外，那校長不過二十多歲，敎員也相差無幾。我向他們說了來意，校長很謙遜，說是値不得一看。我又說，正是要把內地辦敎育困苦的情况、介紹到外面去，好得着國人一種帮助，他見我的態度，果然是很誠懇，才引了我進去。那一切組織的簡陋情形，那全不必去說了，及至坐下來一談，才知道全校裏裏外外，就是這校長和教員兩個人。另有一個工友，連門房同廚房，都包辦了。因爲這是一所古廟，敎室倒有三個。然而一批二十上下年紀的小學生，他們並不在課堂上上課，各人捧了一本錢裝書，有的在院子裏徘徊，有的在屋檐下十階上髙聲朗誦。或者念由不在髙，有仙則名。或者念孟子見梁惠王，王曰叟。還有兩個八九歲的孩子，帶走帶跳，大聲念着駱駝，大車。書包，馬，牛。原來在念幼稚園裏用的看圖識字。這便算他是改良私塾，也有些不對，决不能滿院子跑若念書，而這課堂又要他何用？周有容笑道：我做了陝西快一年的縣長，倒不知道內地敎育是這種情形。秩序是這個樣子壞，他那校長向你怎樣的表示呢？志前道：我想着，他們也許是習慣成自然，不怎麽以爲奇怪了。（一九三）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>無論那一項工藝，决不用一個新進的生手；每一個生手進來，必須先埋頭學習，待學滿了數年之後，才有被輪到工作的機會。至於那些領袖的藝工是更不容易了！伊們必須在未充領袖之前，先有了多年的超越的成績，才得升　起來；同時伊的助手們還得不斷的努力，以備將來升補爲領袖的預備。只要待原任領袖的人年紀稍大，似乎不能再有良好的工作表現的時候，新的領袖便在那一班修養了多年的助手挑選起來補充。所以伊們的工作技術，永遠是不會退化的，而且都有一貫的精神和秘訣，像祖傅父，父傳子的世傳職業一樣。雖然實際上，伊們都各有各的出身，彼此絕少血統或親戚的關係；然而精神上竟像一家人無異，這是和外間尤其不同的一點！</p>
<p>如今回想起來，宮內的一切費用端的是浩繁得不得了，單從這些工藝上講，已够人活活的嚇死，我在宮中住了那麽幾年，可說是沒有一天不見有新製就的鳳鞋，送到太后跟前來讓伊品評和察看的。一天工夫，至少必有一兩雙，多至五六雙；這樣一月一年的累積起來，數目自然是極大的了，而這筆費用之鉅，也可以想見了—這還不足爲奇，因爲鞋子畢竟還只能算是一種小東西：更奇的是那些大大件的宮袍和繡服，也是同樣濫費地生產着。（三〇三）</p>

<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>花是屬於陰性的。古今來的墨客騷人，作品裏往往把花來象徵女性，做女性的影子，因爲，凡是花，都是嬌媚的，柔弱的，經不起風吹雨打，就會落英滿地‘，任人踐蹈，花的開，花的落，最多不過幾天的風光，曇花一現，霎那卽逝，正和薄命紅顏的畢生遭遇相彷彿，所以，花，又成了香閨的知己，，女子畢竟是愛花的。</p>
<p>記得紅樓夢裏的林顰卿，看見落花滿地無人掃，就想到了身世之威，做了一首葬花詞，把自身來同離枝的落花並比，它還覺得人不如花咧。</p>
<p>「落花時節」，杜鵑啼血，這是一個都傷威的季節。</p>
<p>現在明星的一部新影片？取名就呌「落花時節」，這是一個含有詩意的名字，內容一定是非常悲惻。</p>
<p>「落花時節」是叙述一個傷春女子，受了人家的欺騙，頗想自拔，可是，在這男性中心社會裏，會得到處碰壁，非但沒有同情的援助，還有人來揶揄，玩弄—指摘—結果是含寃不白，抱病而折，這雖是一部搆思的影片，確實也是現社會的一種時常有得發現的事實，關於這一種改善社會的資任，誰是應該負起來的。</p>
<p>女子的命運，是不是永久像花一樣的柔弱，隨風可以沾泥，沉溺的呢。</p>

<p>— （爲元）</p>
<p>如果要將花帶到別處去，最好先把它們包在濕的報紙裏，而後再包在乾的報紙裏。在花梗的一端可捲得緊些，其他一端應當鬆些。這樣可以延長花的壽命。</p>
<p>花被帶到目的地後，就應當浸在水桶內，短梗的花應當放在碗內。</p>
<p>花瓶裏的水，只要換，不要加。在水內放少許食鹽，就會使花色鮮艷。</p>

<p>應時菜蔬春天各種植物，都剛在萌芽生長。食物中，祗好吃嫩芽的菜蔬，這時都上市供餐，像枸杞頭，馬蘭頭，香椿頭等等，都是素菜中的雋品，各擅異味。那太湖蓴菜在這淸明時節，摘着那細細的芽絲，和火腿，嫩笋，鶏絲等等，一同煮湯，那膩滑的鮮味，眞是獨擅勝塲，莫怪張季鷹先生要拋官不做，回家去吃蓴羹了。</p>
<p>魚羹　春季的塘裏魚，（蘇州俗名，形熊似土附魚）是煮羹最美的鮮魚，那鮮嫩的魚肉，尤其是魚頰上特有的兩朶活肉，約有豆瓣大小，更來得特別鮮美。煮湯的時候，先將魚皮揭去，再將魚的哥骨弄去，然後同嫩笋，火腿，在鶏湯中煮熟；一股鮮潔的滋味，眞是最開胃的佳肴。　魚在春季，魚肉也異常鮮嫩，和火腿嫩笋煮湯，也是鮮美異常；在魚湯中略加酸醋，更別有一種雋味。</p>
<p>甲魚　甲魚是　的俗名，春天的甲魚，都是小小的幼　，肉與裙邊，都是十分鮮嫩的，所以在菜花吐黄，牡丹著花的時候，甲魚是十分名貴的，喚做菜花甲魚，和牡丹甲魚，價錢是很貴的。燒甲魚的方法，先將甲魚殺死，（甲魚紅肚者有毒，應擇肚白者）用刀將腹剖開，在沸水中將外面的黑皮剝去，再在淸水中洗滌乾凈。甲魚紅燒，淸煮，都有妙味。不過甲角也和「着甲」一般，須和猪肉同煮，借猪肉的肥油，吃起來才膩膩的可口。燒甲魚的配味，須略略甜些，甲魚身上最好吃的，就是那週身的裙邊，、又肥又嫩，吃起來，眞津津有味。</p>
<p>鶏火鱔　淸燉鶏火鱔，也是春季當令的佳肴，將肥壯的黄鱔，殺死洗凈，切做小小的段頭，然後再將生鶏切成一塊塊的小塊，和着火腿嫩笋，一同在文火上慢慢淸煮，等到火候到家，那鶏鱔等的滋味，十分鮮美：尤其是那淸淸的湯，一泓見底，吃到嘴裏，眞比一切菜肴都鮮潔哩。</p>
<p>笋油　雨後春笋，多不勝數，笋在春天，原是最普遍的菜蔬，笋的長處，就是無論煮葷，煮素，和味，獨煮，都有他獨特的鮮味。笋除煮蔬菜外，還可用來熬油，笋油的煮法，先將笋去　切小，開着大量的油鍋，俟油煮熱，將笋傾入油中，慢慢煮熟，然後加入醬油，煮熟以後，盛在磁缸中，可以藏過夏天。那種笋油，又鮮又香，係素菜中的妙品。在吃麵的當兒，加入幾匙笋油，其鮮美眞不下於菌油哩！</p>

<h3 id="c224">不景氣的到來後的美國流行曲 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 森</p>
<p>一九二九年裏，美國開始了空前的不景氣，無數的工塲倒閉，成千成萬人失業，波士頓各個大橋，做了失業羣衆的露天旅館，紐約郊外請願的退伍軍人，在他們破舊的天幕外，詼諧地掛上支加哥大旅館的招牌。成羣的失業行列，向白宮伸着手要麵包。——這些痛苦，都反映在他們當時的流行曲裏，這些流行曲恰成了那苦難的襲擊的一面鏡子。</p>
<p>在這痛苦初初襲來的時候，快樂的「洋開」（Yankee美國人通稱。）開始感到不愉快，於是那些餓着肚皮的街頭詩人，也寫出無數不愉快的歌，當時頂流行的，是一首呌「自己撫慰罷！」（Give　Yourself　a　pat　on　the　back）的歌，這歌一出，無數市塲上失敗的人，個個口上都這樣唱：</p>
<p>「笑並且快樂呵！</p>
<p>爲了明天我們數不清的背約，</p>
<p>有抵押給他好了！」</p>
<p>這是那不景氣時代的一首强爲歡笑的陰鬱的歌，反面帶點樂觀氣分的，却有「讓我喝另一杯咖啡罷！」（Let's　haveanother　cup　of　coffee）</p>
<p>「虹現在天邊，</p>
<p>讓我喝另一杯咖啡罷！</p>
<p>讓我吃另一塊肉饅頭罷！」</p>
<p>一九三二年的不景氣更利害了，不景氣的流行曲，也更產生得多，最普遍的有「順境來了，觀樂起來（Good　timeare　coming　so　cheer　up）「快樂日又來了。」（Happy　days　are　herea　again）</p>
<p>這些正表現出「洋開兒（Yankee　boy）不示弱的氣慨，但不景氣實在太深刻了，到不能耐時，到底產生了赤裸裸的落魄者憂鬱的流行曲，最初出現的有「兄弟，你能省出一角錢嗎？（Brother,canyou　spare　a　dime)從這時起，街頭詩人都一致的向眞實寫去，那時美國正處處傳着地方銀行倒閉的消息，處處都聽見失業的歎息。流行曲中，有歌句說：</p>
<p>「是禮拜一了，</p>
<p>我仍只有一塊錢！」　　人人都被窮困和飢餓壓迫着，哼哼「我仍只有一槐錢。」確是最合胃口的感傷的歌句。</p>
<p>一九三二到三三年的中問，依然暗雲低迷，一時相當可生活的人，沒落了幾十萬，失業率更不住地加髙，這些街頭詩人暫時沈默後，總不容易等到可樂觀的時代到來，於是又產生了「熄了燈睡去罷！」這類陰鬱的曲子。</p>
<p>「沒有多的錢在銀行裏了！</p>
<p>沒有伶俐的幼兒讓我們打了！</p>
<p>到底做甚麽呢？</p>
<p>熄了燈睡去罷！」</p>
<p>這幾乎是帶着淚聲唱出的歌曲了。樂天的得天獨厚的黄金之國的人民，會遭遇着這樣的困難，並且會傷心到這種地步，確是一個奇異的現象呵！</p>
<p>但美國人不是宿侖論者，不會永遠這樣悲傷的。在經濟情形稍呈好轉，他們便又立刻樂觀起來。一九三三年尾上，又有「又有路了！」（The　road　is　openagain）快樂的行列。」（The　cheer　parade）這類歌曲出現。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統的復興計劃下，又產生了「集合進軍」（Marching　along　together）一類雄壯的流行曲。</p>
<p>「集合進軍，</p>
<p>分配那微笑與眼淚，</p>
<p>集合進軍，</p>
<p>吹着天要晴明的口笛。」這首歌中間，明明還留着些物質苦痛的痕跡。正如另一首情歌中：</p>
<p>「說呀，心肝，你積有一點錢嗎？</p>
<p>那一切是我要知道的。」</p>
<p>過於功利的戀人們的窮乏相，眞寫得詼諧而淋漓盡致了。</p>
<p>目前風靡了全美國，常做了政治家的演說和大新聞記事的引語，人人一唱他都要微笑的短歌，却是那首雄壯的「誰怕呢？」（Who's　afraid?）</p>
<p>「誰怕這巨大的不善的狼？</p>
<p>這巨大的不善的狼，</p>
<p>這巨大的不善的狼，</p>
<p>誰怕這……？」</p>
<p>目前美國，全國都唱着這戰歌一樣雄勁的流行曲，個個口裏都哼着他，像要由全亞美利加人民的歌聲，嚇走那可怕的不景氣的狼一樣。</p>
<p>把這些歌曲的內容，槪括地觀察一下，我們知道這中間表現的是多眞切的情感，中間有不示弱的Yankee有反宿命論的樂天主義，却又有絕望的嘆息。——這感情是多眞摯與坦白啊！</p>
<h3 id="c225">生活 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 何爲</p>
<p>近來自己的生活，的確已經糟透了。完全沒有把握的，今天不知明天會不會餓死。蹙住在一個洗浴間里，每天每天都想寫一點東西解决生活，但這希望卻是始終渺茫的，因爲一篇文章寫出去以後，從此就毫無消息，所謂「希望」也就此完了。</p>
<p>完全餓肚的經騐雖則很少，可是半餓肚的滋昧，却是每天在這兒嘗的。每頓吃着十二個銅子一碗的光麵，加上兩隻大餅，就馬馬虎虎的過去了，有時簡直就只吃兩隻大餅。</p>
<p>一天三分之二的時間都是化在借錢上面，不論是什麽天氣，不論是寒夏秋冬。有時在馬路上或江邊徘徊着，有時在三等電車車里擁擠着。天氣鷙起來了，却還拖着一件爛棉袍，人是完全給悶得糊糊塗塗的失了知覺，走起路來簡直像在半空飄蕩着似的。</p>
<p>一找點職業做做啊！」</p>
<p>朋友們親切地叮嚀涪，我自已也這樣想着，可是問題就在這點，因爲應得向那里去找職業，我是完全茫然的。各處都已人滿了，沒有站腳的餘地。我有時想弄個校對做做也好，但就是這個幾年以前鄙視的差使也是那樣艱難。</p>
<p>自己怎麽能够活到如今，的碗是奇怪的，照許多人推算，大約我是應該早巳死的了，甚至骨頭也應早已枯　了。可是我今天還能够活着，這一方而使許多朋友欣慰，一方也使許多朋友難堪。</p>
<p>「你不做事，也沒有文章發表，單靠挪借一點錢，是怎麽生活下去的呢？你本領眞大，眞正厲害！」</p>
<p>這些朋友大都是很驚奇的，他們仔細地考察我，盤問我，顯出懷疑的臉相，露着雪白的牙齒獰笑着。</p>
<p>『我不信，或者你受到什麽……』</p>
<p>因爲他們要跳舞，要看戲，要進大餐館，甚至還要賭博，像我這種生活當然是難了解的。不能了解，却偏會不要臉的亂造謠言，這侮辱我永遠不會忘掉。</p>
<p>更使人生氣的，是許多朋友　了我的窘况以後，彷彿我說謊似的反駁我說：</p>
<p>「可是你的衣服還穿得相當乾凈！」</p>
<p>這意義是說，如果我眞是窘得斑樣，那無疑地要像叫化子一樣　齪，一樣襤褸，我現在的穿着，似乎還太尊貴一點呢。</p>
<p>可是我親愛的朋友們！我究竟並不是乞丐啊……</p>
<h3 id="c226">甲必丹先生（上） <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>『孩子，吿訴你吧：要生活就非冒生死之險不可，你以爲沒有山豬就不再有危險麽？你錯了。人有時也會吃人的呀！』離開了家，坐在飄散着紅檳榔的氣味和象標香烟的白霧的三等車廂里，我，獨自一個人在回到那家洋服店去的途中牽記着父親的話。火車轆　地往一前走，車身微微搖盪不停。仲出腦袋去，窗格外邊的天地是廣闊的。</p>
<p>兩個多鐘頭以後我到達了那個我必須下車的小埠頭，跳下車，大包袱揹在我的背上，這里面有的是一個人的生活的必需品。我沒有錢坐馬車，走起路來至少也得費去三十分鐘模樣，才可以到目的地。</p>
<p>我走着。永遠是六月天的太陽照在腦袋上，兩股汗水從額上滾下來。咬緊牙根，我，是準備在人生的旅途上受一些苦難，而又回到這里了。</p>
<p>『啊，是你麼？怎麽又來了的？』老板迎上來，似乎有些出乎他的意料之外，這樣問着。</p>
<p>我放下包袱，氣喘喘地，「爸爸要我回來，所以—』我看着老板肥猪似的臉孔。他呼了一口氣，用手在唇上摸了一下，對我說：『你可以住在這里的。』於是，我重新把包袱揹上三層樓那陰暗而低塞的小房間去。剛想在硬牀板上坐下來休息一會兒，樓下却有人在叫着我的名字了。</p>
<p>是老板娘。她油亮的麻臉出現在樓梯。，這婦人又把菜籃遞到我的乎上，不待我問，便報數一樣地報出了她要買的東西；同時，給了我應當付到猪肉桌或者靑菜攤上去的錢，搖幌着屁股走開了。</p>
<p>生活回復到先前的樣子。收賬的夥計病好了，每天他還是踏了那架自由車出門去。『我倒高興遇到一次山猪，』有一次他那麼地向我說，『到現在不知走過多少園坵和荒野，都沒有能够看到牠們。』好像很爲失望似地，這傢伙搖搖腦袋。不曾曙受到生活的危險的人是不懂得艱難困苦的—晚上，當我做完了一切該做的事，而拖着一條疲憊的身體走上三層樓，躱到那暗角里去安息的時候，心里這麼想着。他如果眞的有一天遇見山猪了，一定會嚇得魂飛魄散的吧！</p>
<p>這其間，我的學徒生活是辛苦而且孤獨的。尤其是在晚上，裁縫們都一吃完飯便到外邊去了，誰都好像能够找到他們的着第。譬如那個收賬的伙計，他沒有一天夜里不是上後街的咖啡店去，跟那些海南人打在一起，天花亂墜地談到睡覺的鐘點才回來。我可不許走開去：並且不到九點半鐘也不許關上店門。所以，我常常呆坐在店門口，望着寂寞的街。對門理髮舖子里的爪哇人髙興起來就也坐在門口彈起日本人做的六弦琴來，或者唱着；聲音衝破了街頭的沉悶。追隨着這歌聲。不時有一個中年人會踏上我們家里來，永遠那麽瘦弱的身子坐在裁縫檯邊的椅子上，不大開口說話。他和老板的感情似乎很好，說上來也有不停地，直到關門的時候。</p>
<p>「甲必丹先生，」我回過嘴來對他說，我的厦門話不大高明，我用心說到他能聽懂的程度：「老板外邊去了。」我一邊指着外面的街，這時正有一輛馬車馳過。</p>

<p>— 胡緒</p>
<p>和我一樣，那個落魄在異鄉底朋友李，今天早上發來了一封信，吿訴我：「在昨天黄昏，我們底女兒從她媽媽底肚子裏，鮮血淋淋地出來到這昏亂的世界了！現在，大的小的都還平安；但因爲沒有錢，事前連孩子穿用的衣服也不曾準備，所以我們那苦命的孩子，直到我寫這封信底時候，還赤身露體裏在破被絮裏。你能不能替我設法一點錢，救救我們底孩子」！</p>
<p>錢麼，我摸摸衣袋裏還剩二十六個銅子，今天底飯錢呢。「這樣吧，」我在心上打着算盤，沒有錢的人，只好可憐相點了；「我去替他討幾件孩子衣服來」。</p>
<p>低着頭，走出了自己底住窠。霞飛路漫長而光滑，那個晦色的天壓在我頭上，風在週身扇着，但我底心却熱得幾乎是焦灼的。</p>
<p>在呂班路口，找到了同鄉蘇底寓所；蘇和他底妻正在精緻的臥室裏，嘻嘻着在替那偭二歲底小天使穿戴華麗的新裝，見了我，像要證實他們內心底歡樂似的招呼道：。</p>
<p>「來，看看我們底孩子阿漂亮」？</p>
<p>我茫然地點點頭，然後用了使他們吃驚的口氣說：</p>
<p>「我要向你們叨光一點」！</p>
<p>「你要什麼」？男的問。</p>
<p>「你們金剛誕生時穿的衣服，可不可給我幾件」？</p>
<p>「是不是你生了孩子」？女的打趣地跟了一句，使得那挺着疑竇的眼睛的同鄕蘇也哈哈笑了。</p>
<p>「並非」，我說：「是我底一個貧困的朋友」。</p>
<p>「可以」，男的慷慨地向他底妻；「你去我幾件出來」。</p>
<p>等着，紅紅綠綠的孩衣，從衣櫉裏，從女施主底手上遞過來，一件，二件……　　「這裏是十件」，女的說：「還是很新的，可是紅蛋不要忘了」。</p>
<p>眞是沒分寸的話，假如送得起紅蛋，還愁什麼孩子衣服！但我確乎認爲無須向他們解釋得；這樣已够我感恩不盡。我千謝萬謝地吿辭出來，人是輕鬆得多了！那個晦色的天離我遠遠地，風帶來了宜人的氣息，每一條街熙攘着快樂的人。</p>
<p>二里多路在我興奮的步子上過去；到了，朋友李住的窄陋的灶披間到了。李底背向着門，灣身向着躺在坑上底那個黄婆子！他底妻，像是商量些什。</p>
<p>「咦，老伍來了」！</p>
<p>首先看到我的，是女的底兩隻失神的眼睛，跟着朋友李底那張一向是抑悒的臉轉了過來</p>
<p>「阿伍」！</p>
<p>我們握着手，沸騰的熱血，在彼此手心上交流了。我底視綫從他底臉上移到坑上；</p>
<p>「康健麽？」</p>
<p>「還—好。」她說話遲鈍無力，接着一個委屈的笑，在她底貧血的嘴角上。</p>
<p>「孩子底衣服，我已經弄到了。」我打開衣包來；「一共十件，這是我底一個同鄕給我的，還有九成新呢」。</p>
<p>空氣在窄陋的灶披間裏流動了。</p>
<p>「拿來，放在被窩裏煖一下，就可以給她穿起來了。老伍，」她髙興了；「你來看看孩子！」</p>
<p>我看得　淸楚，在破被窩裏有着一隻剝皮的靑蛙！</p>
<p>「我要回去了，」我說：「過幾天我當設法幾個錢來。」</p>
<p>「最好在月底以前設法得來，因爲房錢，已經來要過四次了。」男的說，我們之間是沒有客氣的。</p>
<p>「好的。」</p>
<p>我氣急地答應着，拖着沉重的腳鐐似的離開了他們，晦色的天又壓在我底頭上了！……</p>

<p>太克司休養了好些時候，便加入其他各處的跳舞「馬拉松』，這變成他的職業了。他得了一份用希臘語譯出的「是呵，我們沒有香蕉，」把這首歌練習了一番，這首歌連同他的特種跳舞後來出名的很。愛好這種歌舞的聽衆逐漸多起來，他每天能够賺着十元到十五元的外快。即使有時候他在「馬拉松」塲上免不了中途退出，他退出的時候，袋子裏的錢也還是飽的。等到他在銀行裏有了大枇的存欵，他同有錢的美國人一樣心裏不由得起了回故鄉去的念頭。他現在是這個新世界裏一位名人了。他受着著名的希臘同鄕的宴待，他的照相甚至放到了希臘報上小品文章的上頭。</p>
<p>太克司一共參加了跳舞「馬特松十六次。有八次，他領到了頭獎，他還得了一千元的「超等馬拉松」的錦標，這次「馬拉松」只有別的一馬拉松」的優勝者才可以參加，而且跳舞期間沒有休息的時候。他現在有着五千元的積蓄，够他囘鄕去，於是他回希臘去了，然而歷次「馬拉松』的勞苦已經傷害了他的肺，他害着肺結核了。肺病療養院在他的希臘故鄉的山間，開設着好幾家等他回到希臘，他不得不做其中一家的病人，他帶着爛了的肺住在那兒，他在美國賺得的錢正好做着他的開銷呢。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c230">取締男女同學 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>男女同學這問題，在過去曾經是中國敎育上及整個社會上一個爭論的大問題。現在這問題似乎是已吿一結束了，但現在却又有人企圖在推翻這舊案。據報載，北平决於二十四年度起，實行中學男女分校，嚴厲取締男女同學。這問題現在顯然又被人從故紙堆中發掘出來而重新擺在我們眼前了。</p>
<p>關於男女同學的問題，其實內容是沒有什麼值得討論的。而在自負有維持風化之責者看來，這不過是呌女子們最後還得無聲地回到家庭中去—不，回到吃人禮敎的牢籠中去。這話一點也不刻薄，仔細推究自負維持風化人的心腸與頭腦，以爲男女同學是最足破壞社會風化的制度，使社會所謂秩序」更不容易維持（因爲除男子外又加了一批不安者），舊禮敎由此無人負責，這樣我們身負維持風化之責者，就不能不起來講究到男女同學這問題了。使女子離開社會，退回家庭，退回到舊禮敎墳墓中去，社會必定安謐得多。</p>
<p>環繞我們周圍的許許多多的痛苦和壓迫，應該討論的地方甚多，然而這些對於身負維持風化之責的人們是不會感到任何興趣的。社會經濟極端的尖銳化，對於他們絕對不覺得是一件很殘酷的事。他們現在似乎只在專心致力於所謂風化等等的問題。地獄中的呼聲，飛到他們耳邊是會立刻變成一陣淸風。反之，怎樣維持風化的苦心，在他們却一刻沒有放鬆的，眞是可敬之至。</p>

<p>朝暾初上，晨霧慚散；明月灣的許多人家的屋尖上，都已繞着一縷縷的炊烟，把這小小的漁村籠罩在烟霧中，整個村子僅剩了個糢糊的輪廓。村中除了喔喔的鶏啼聲外，還有那些小孩子的哭吵聲；於是沉寂的空氣頓時煩囂了起來。村前的河綿上全蹲滿了淘米洗菜的婦女們，談話和嬉笑聲，嘈雜地，就在這里交流成了一片</p>
<p>這時，黃鴨老四已習慣地從硬板床上溜了起來，打着沉重的咳　，拖了一支潮烟筒，走向屋後露坑上去如厠了。</p>
<p>回來，抹了一把臉，看見他老婆已經將昨夜的剩飯燒了粥，於是他就揀比較厚些的　了　大碗—</p>
<p>吃過早飯，照例地走到鴨棚前去，將門開了開來；一隻二隻三隻…的數着放出窠來的黃鴨，看看有沒有意外，也許可有傳染着病的？等到黃鴨完全出了棚，聚集在園里的曠地上，爭着吃梢里浸着的麥麩時，他便携着一隻篾籃，蹲到地下，把一隻手伸進熱呼呼的鴨棚里去，摸出一個個白壳的靑壳的鴨蛋出來，輕輕地放進了籃里，一股鴨屎臭直望着他的鼻　里鑽了進去，可是這在黃鴨老四是無法避免的。</p>
<p>一二三……十……十五……二十……三十……三十一；他數若籃里的蛋，倒有三十一個。他想：三十一個在早幾年洋價賤，蛋價貴的時候就值一塊錢：可是，可是，現在一分錢一個，一塊錢就得一百個，三十一個只直三毛淺，如果平均扯每一隻鴨子產蛋一百，那末一年只有一塊錢，以五十隻鴨子（要沒有發生任何意外的話）統計之，也祇有五十塊錢好收入，五十塊錢怎麼够我一家的生活呢？况且，鴨子還要吃啦！</p>
<p>他的老婆走過來，將蛋籃接了過去</p>
<p>「當心打碎；這里是三十一個」！他鄭重地將蛋籃遞給了她。</p>
<p>「現在家里又有一百多個蛋了，你還是拿去換些米來吧！米是早已完了，向三嬸娘借的二升米也該還她們啦」。她嘮哩嘮叨的對他說。</p>
<p>「哦！」他似乎滿不在意的答應了一聲，掮起一根趕竿向着河灘頭走去。那些黃鴨看見了那支竿梢上掛着一把破芭蕉扇的篙子，牠們也就從河灘邊爬到了河里，在水面上浮遊着。</p>
<p>小船漸慚地向角灣港口那邊過去：黃鴨老四橫着那根趕竿站在船頭上，一面指揮着鴨羣，一面點着塘岸。鴨羣是隨着趕竿的指揮而悠閒地在水面上划着，「　！　！　！」的就在河里找取小魚小蝦來充饑。</p>
<p>太陽慢慢兒的從偏東爬到了天中，河面上所有的捕魚船都一艘一艘地回去吃午飯了；鴨子的肚子大概都已裝飽，而黃鴨老四的饑腸却已有些咕嚕咕嚕地呌了起來，於是他也趕着一羣鴨子回去吃中飯了。到了下午再放牠們出來，直至太陽躱到山背後的時候，他便將一根趕竿攔着，讓鴨子從竿底下鐵過去；一隻二隻三隻……他就這樣地數着。</p>
<p>黃鴨老四趕了十多年的黃鴨，無論是春，夏，秋，冬，甚至是細雨霏霏的天氣，他的生活總是在河面上的：除了風雨冰雪的時候，他不得不把這一羣鴨　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十多斤豆渣或麩皮去供給牠們，這實在是不容易應付的。所以他一踫到這種天氣就要發起愁來。</p>
<h3 id="c232">過白浪灘 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>——南歸散記——</p>
<p>寓白浪灘約還有半里水程，船就靠堤停下來，舟人說要上灘了。堤上已先等着七八個拖纜夫，這些拖　夫都是白浪灘畔左近山村的人，終歲以拖纜爲業。沒有這些縴戶船是撑不過灘的。據舟人說，他們中也是分帮的。每一隻船都有一定的僱主，不能隨便紊僱別帮。平時水小，拖一次灘，船家只需給塊半或兩塊錢；若遇水大就要增至三四塊，都有一定行規。</p>
<p>白浪灘水勢險惡，驚濤駭浪中，暗埋着許多礁石，中間只有一條僅可通船的彎曲水道；，湄江舟人走到此地沒有不提心吊膽，目爲生死關頭。因此旅客們到此也多願捨舟登岸，一則可减輕載重；二則可避免萬一的危險。</p>
<p>時正當午，半日舟行老是委刎在小小的蓬艙里，心已煩膩極了，聽說船要上灘，就忽然想起趁機上岸去帮他們拖一程纜也許很有意思的；於是連忙在綢籃里翻出運動鞋，跨出船頭一邊穿鞋，一邊笑笑的對舟人說明要去帮大家拖纜。</p>
<p>—吃力得很哩，先生。橫豎船載得輕，汝先生就留在艙里也不見得什麽。而且太陽也辣哩。</p>
<p>舟人回給我一個善意的苦笑，意思是說我這個人實在連在太陽下跑一點路也不容易的。</p>
<p>—不要緊的！借一個笠　給我就得了。汝們可莫當我是軟脚蟹，我是鄉下大起來的　　！</p>
<p>他們高聲地笑了，隨卽抓過一個笠帽給我。拖纜的幷船夫合我共十二個，大家把纜索罩好後，就一步一步的拖着遠遠落在後面水上的船，向着驚濤駭浪的灘頭　進。</p>
<p>六月當午的太陽像一團火一樣炙灼在頭上，身上淋滿汗水。當拖到一個崗崖上，路陡地險窄起來；舟己行近灘頭，水勢轉急，濤聲怒號有如萬馬奔騰騰，肩頭的　索也勒得更緊了；脚，像浮在沙地上，老是踩不着實地般，步子漸漸堅鈍沉　下來。他們也許担怕我太吃力，就吁着氣喊起來。</p>
<p>—先生，汝放下罷，路又險：跌下去可不是玩的！</p>
<p>路，果然險窄，崖下就是驚濤駭浪的灘流！可是，我不怕，我的心已給一股悲壯興奮的血流冲激着！望着汹湧怒號的灘流，汗水流在面上，背上，手上！忘記了疲困，忘記了危險，像遺落了什麼，突然記起來似的，我想起影片上，伏爾加河來了。回頭看看彎腰屆背襤褸羣！這白浪灘頭的！戶與舟人，覺得他們都同樣具有着伏爾加船夫的窮菩的歲日興命運！心像給什麼膩着，頓興起無限愴惻：我於是喘若氣，放開喉嚨唱起那首情調悲壯蒼凉的船夫曲來。</p>
<p>這樣一來可惹起他們滑稽的笑聲來了。自然啦，他們是不會懂得我這時的心情與感想的；也不會懂這首歌是想着什麼意義的。一個舟人就問道。</p>
<p>—先生，辛苦啦，又拖又唱的。汝唱的什麽歌吓，怪好聽的。</p>
<p>—好聽嗎？哩？……。</p>
<p>太陽炙在他們頭上，汗水流在他們　　，　上，身上，　門　以董非董的、不發一言，喘着氣，一步一步拖起粗壯的腿。</p>

<p>— 施瑛</p>
<p>那天早晨，照例是陰沉沉的。我走到樓下，他們正談着輪埠跌死了一個旅客。輪埠離我那裏不遠，我反正沒事，自然願意去瞧一下。小鎭底街路，早晨是泥濘的；薄霧給河水籠上淡白的色彩。早班班的汽輪已開走了，可是輪埠還異常的熱鬧，一圈的人圍攏着，浮動着嘈雜的聲音。從人叢中，我瞧見一個中年的漢子，直挺挺地躺在濕冷的街石上，已經僵冷了，一柄紙傘，一個白包裏，落在旁邊，枯直的手臂，還像不捨地按扶着。木然如死灰的臉，彷彿還有的多要說的話；卽如他能够說，他說給誰聽呢？四圍盡是些好奇而幸災樂禍似的臉，偶而有一點薄情的太息，早給紛　的談笑跟打趣掩蓋了。袛有那個僵直的漢子，痛苦地躺着。一個蓬着頭髮的女人，像是看够了，同情似的向旁邊的人說：。「瞧模樣，還砥三十多歲呢，穿着絲綿的綢袍，也不像貧苦人家啊。這樣死在客地，連家中底大小也不知道。他　那裏人？」</p>
<p>賣早點心的老頭子，他是看見這悲劇的，他在那裏絮叨地吿訴別人說：一這漢子，是想乘德淸班輪船的。天剛亮的時候，他急促地挾着包裏，走出衖口，脚底怎樣一滑，便跌了倒去。—可是不是中風，這樣壯年的人會中風嗎？那時有人瞧見的，也有發個別的旅客，瞧他躺在地上掙扎着，臉色變得難看，氣息奄奄地；誰敢去扶他呢？沒姓名沒來歷的人，好意救扶了他到家，反而脫不了干係啊！如果死了，還說給你謀斃呢。瞧他在幾分鐘之內，痛苦地死了，可是沒有一個人肯扶他。這事情衹能讓地保去了結吧。……」—爲了免脫自己底干係，誰也不肯援手一個垂終的旅客，護他死倒在路上，這人間誰說有同情呢？</p>
<p>雖然大家儘是用薄情的談笑，擲給那躺着的屍體，可是終有熱心人，找出這漢子底來歷來了。在小市鎭上，嘴是最好的新聞傳佈者。一位皮毛行底老板，認出這漢子是他底顧客。這漢子姓夏，德淸人，做皮毛生意的，這次是來賈羊皮，得了百多塊錢：昨天晚上，還跟人家一起喝酒相打牌。今天早晨想回德着了，也許家中老少，盼望他帶了錢回丢，才回以度冬呢，誰料到死在路上！爲生活奔波的人，家裏底女人跟孩子，還帶着希望的笑容在等候他。難道沒有人去通知他们嗎？一個皮毛行底夥計。去搖長途電話了。四圍瞧熱鬧的人，更集攏得多了。有人去找了兩張蘆扉來，掩蓋了這漢子，免得礙事。</p>
<p>下午，家中底人來了，見了這悽慘的情景，女人是號啕大哭。哭聲更引動了許多人。一具白皮的棺木，放在旁邊。可是還不讓這屍體安靜地放進棺木。說是相帮看護的那些地保們，問她們要錢，具結。那個女人，袛好讓屍體躺在路上，含着眼淚，給逼着走了幾個地方去乞憐了！</p>

<p>多情却是總痴情。薄命紅顏自古云。堪嘆倩女離魂後。湞湘到處不生春。怡紅公子情難盡。哭吊　前表寸心。但見那草木凋零聲寂寂。凄凉滿目影沉沉。　鵡不知心緒事。喃喃詩誦葬花聲。見鞍自必當思馬。睹物焉能不想人。妹妹呼你絕世才容今已渺。空留遺物面前存。衹望與你常相伴。誰知那萬事由天不由人。可憐你自小多磨折。可憐你抱恨赴幽冥。想當初靑梅竹馬同遊戲。到今日耳　斯磨再不能。想當初玩月賞花聯詩句。到今日狂歌作賦冉不能。想當初兩心相印多親愛。到今日形影相隨再不能。想當初你一頻一笑無限好。到今日欲見音容再不能。我今靈前頻默訴。你在九泉可知聞。悲切切。淚紛紛。如醉如痴欲斷魂。這眞是富貴榮華如春夢。人生聚合等秋雲。到不知跳出煩惱地。從此割斷這不了情。做個逍遙世外人。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊</p>
<h3 id="c237">告別本刊讀者諸君 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 不敏</p>
<p>從明日，五月一日起，本刊將與本報讀者暫吿離隔。因此，我以編者的地位，不得不向本報讀者諸君，尤其是愛護本刊的朋友們，略說幾句吿別的話。</p>
<p>我所說的吿別的話，包含着許多有餘無盡之意。申報電影　刋現在雖然停頓，但袛可以說是吿一段落，而不能即說是停刊，因爲我們論事，不能專就形式而言，這所謂電影專刋的固定地位，在雷專報頭旁邊的一百二十方寸地位，雖然暫形消滅，但關於電影的文字，仍舊可在別的地位發表。是則形式雖亡，物質猶有存在之可能也。</p>
<p>至於電專所以要停頓的原因，此則關乎館方的行政，在此很雞以數語發表之。我在此可以說的，就是在此停頓期間，我們可以由此覘得社會人士，一般讀者，以及與電影事業藝術有關係的人們，他們覺得這像申報電影專刋似的刋物，是否確有其存在的需要，以及於他們是否有益。</p>
<p>當然，需要有明白表示出來的，有默認而無所表示的。我個人認爲如果電影專刊是需要的話，至多亦是屬於後一類的，因爲我們中國人，數千年來「安貧樂棄」的敎訓，早已吿訴我們，有得吃……吃吃……嘸不吃……也不搶來吃。這樣一來，即使申報電專確實係需要的話（在此我個人不作肯定的話），他們在停頓之中，我以爲亦未必覺得非讀不可的。</p>
<p>所以，本刊停頓的久暫，亦就視乎這種刊物的需要，是否十分顯明與急切。</p>
<p>申報電專自二十一年十一月發刊到現在，算起來己是兩年半的光陰。在此三十個月光陰之中，本刊在「不求有功，但求無過」的圭臬之下，總算盡了一些綿薄。在編者本人方面，我始終沒有敢以電影文化藝術倡導者的地位自居。我所已做到的，是給與讀者一個關乎電影藝術有趣味的刊物，同時使他們得到一些關乎電影藝術的普通知識，和一些由電影界人物生活經歷中所得來的人生敎訓。</p>
<p>不錯的，本刊亦時時有宣傳文字的發表，但是這都是些義務性質的宣傳，决不是受人利用，或有其個人的用意的。再則，這些宣傳的小品文字，亦以興趣和事實重爲。幷且這與編排方面，有很大手續上的便利。</p>
<p>至於編輯方面，在此兩年半之中，我深得許多位先生的臂助，尤其是凌鶴先生。他始終努力地向前幹著，直到今日。他是與申報電影專刊相始終的人。他的精神應得讀者諸君的欽佩的。本刊編者，今謹向凌君及其他助我之諸君表示感謝。</p>
<p>最後，我應向本報讀者及本刋愛護者道歉的，就是在這兩年半之中，我會接受過許多眞實朋友的來函，提供許多有益的意見。這些意見，有些已見諸實行，有些却沒有。但編者爲時開的原故，却未能隨即裁答，這點尚望諸君加以深諒。我但就我的管見所及，覺得如此可以　成一個有價值，有興趣，而不失其嚴正報格的刊物。</p>
<p>讀者諸君始終的愛護，不時的鞭策，不斷的鼓勵，我謹以編者之地位，向諸君致謝。</p>
<p>我望讀者諸君，以愛護本刊的熱忱，愛護本報的本身，我幷望本刊，無論在物質上，或連形式上，不久再與諸君相見。</p>

<h3 id="c238">評「江湖艷蹟」 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Carnival——大上海映——</p>
<p>「江湖艷蹟一的主題是寫一個演木人戲的江湖流浪漢，在老婆病死之後，爲了遺下國孤兒而演成的種種悲喜劇。是一個充滿着父子愛與人世味的戲。但可惜劇作者不曾圍繞着這個主題來作了好的發展，他只常常用配角的　頭，來代替了主湞者的若干內心表演。</p>
<p>一個以木人戲跑碼頭混飯吃的人的生活，本來就那潦倒的了風塵飄零，大都是悲多樂少，那堪冉遭受着患亡之痛呢？作者放過了栩戲劇性的地方，而先在劇中人志克身邊，安排下兩位摯友，著名的扒手麥克是他的琴師，少女黛　是提綫的助手。這樣，志克由麥克的帮助，把自己心愛的兒子從妻父送養育的醫院中偷了出來，逃往外埠去流浪。倘着就依這條綫索寫下去，一個單身流浪漢與幼小的兒子之間，並非無戲可做的。但是劇作者去在兩年之後讓志克帶了兒子回來，與黛茜等相遇，她也因受着志克血做了很好的保姆了。</p>
<p>自然，這樣下去，戲只從志克與黛茜間的戀愛方面發展，自不免太單調了，因此，劇作者就把戲拉人大血熱鬧的背景中去。世界百年紀念會開幕了，百戲雜陳的盛况中，有着兒童比賽會。山麥克小施技倆，把選舉票掉換，志克的孩子就居然得到了首獎。於是案破被捕，孩子失踪，遊樂塲失火等刺激的戲都一齊來了。結果是黛茜救了孩子，志克感恩地和她舉行了牢獄鴛鴦的婚禮，總是六個月刑滿後，他們就可以共同享受着兒子夫婦間的幸福了。</p>
<p>這樣零亂的戲是難免沉悶的，於是只有在輕鬆的噱頭與强烈的刺激上希冀調劑了。這兒有看護婦因和醫生情約，暗中吻錯了來偷小孩的麥克。麥克到處偷東西的滑稽，在遊戲塲中追逐女人吃耳光，以及肥婦，倭人有鬍子的女人等「賣野人頭」中的班底，火燒，捕捉的紛擾塲面。可惜熱閙與趣味畢究還掩不住內容的空虛。做作與巧合的痕跡，似乎是欲蓋彌彰的。</p>
<p>導演Walter　Lang的小總敏是頗爲可取的，只是未能以精鍊明快的剪接來補救拉雜的地方。幾個動亂的多人塲面倒處理得比人少戲多的塲合更好。</p>
<p>主角李脫拉賽那種急速的說話是慣會演動作多，調子快的戲的。在這個充滿了世味，需要內心表演的一江湖艷蹟」中，他是很努力的，只可惜沒有得到最好的成績。大鼻子吉克遜在這兒的成就倒不是在於逗人發笑的滑稽，而於對於麥克這個角色個性把握的相當周到與深刻</p>
<p>演黛茜的女角因爲劇中人的個性太糢糊，她爲什麽愛志克，又爲什麽無從表示這一點是不大淸楚的，因此她演來也就平平地沒有多大發展的。</p>

<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>派斯瓜聽了安東尼的話，知道他亦著了康嘉的迷。他覺得他應盡朋友的義務，他就將他自己和康嘉的關係，以及康嘉的行徑，盡情的吿訴了安東尼。安東尼聽完了他的話，不覺義憤填　的，向派斯瓜立誓，在見過她的一面，痛痛的折辱了她　番　後，即不再和她來往了。</p>
<p>但是康嘉的手段，是着實可以驚人的，安東尼和她一面之後，他已經深深墮入情網，牢不可拔，而胸中本來的憤怒，亦就烟消雲散了。但是很奇怪的，康嘉對於安東尼，亦發生了真情，亦是她生平第一遭。但是她的快樂，却是不能長久的，因爲派斯瓜不久已經知道他們二人愛好的情形。</p>
<p>他雖然痛恨康嘉，但他原有的地位，現在被別人佔去，是他不能忍受的。他雖明知康嘉手段的可惡，但他的愛心還沒有全死，反而被安東尼的新愛，煽動了起來，到了一個不可　止的程度。</p>
<p>他向安東尼要求决鬥，而他的要求亦被安東尼毅然地接受了。</p>
<p>那天晚上，康嘉哀求着安東尼，呌他逃出國境，帶了她同去。但是安東尼却說，他沒有護照，是不能跳過國境的。</p>
<p>到了明天早晨。派斯瓜和安東尼，如期的到了决鬥的地點。康嘉亦來了。她面色灰敗，身軀戰慄着。她不惜向派斯瓜曲身求饒。她吿訴他，她是眞心愛安東尼，求他不要决鬥。但是派斯瓜一言不發，而决鬥的籌備，照舊的進行着。當他手執着槍，在遠處一端，掉過頭來射擊的時候，他面上露着」種深不可測的慘笑。他扳着機鈕，但他却故意的向天開放了。</p>
<p>安東尼却認爲派斯瓜要打死他的，他瞄準派斯瓜的頭部開放了。派斯瓜並沒有死，但傷了眼睛而失明丁。同時警察來了。派斯瓜被拾到醫院裏，而安東尼亦被逮捕了，因爲他不　逃避，</p>
<p>康嘉為了安東尼的性命，憶在危險之中，她就是去求見總督巴斯吉篤。她用盡了狐媚的功夫，總設法呌他答應了釋放安東尼。時時，她又設法弄到了兩張護照，她告訴總督，那兩張護照，是她和一位表兄出國用的。總督亦信以爲眞，而不加以根究了。</p>
<p>不久，他們二人已經到了邊境。康嘉不覺一陣心酸起來。她緊緊挽住了安東尼的臂，而她的面色，慘白得像一張絨。安東尼一邊是興高彩烈的……他得到了自由，又博美人之愛，現在涉足異國，鶼鶼鰈蝶，其樂無比了。可是在火車震動了將開的時候，康嘉悄然地跳了下來，讓安東尼一個前往。</p>
<p>火車已開，安東尼拼命的呼喊着，但是康嘉祇指着手，搖著頭，她的眼睛充滿了淚水，而她的一顆芳心，亦將要破裂了。她知道她跟了安東尼出國之後，她不能一刻安心，不能一刻享受快樂的。她覺得那裹祇有一條唯一的道路：……那就是回到派斯瓜的身邊去。他需要她。她應向他懺悔她一切的罪過。她決定要將她未來的歲月，償報已往的錯誤。（完）</p>

<p>— 劉既漂</p>
<p>C（病人部）</p>
<p>病室分男。女兒童。產婦及新產小兒等室。此外又有公共病室及個人病室之分。</p>
<p>（一）公共病室—近代病室已小於昔日。每室約置床位八個至十二個。今更有减少四個至二個之趨勢。容八個床位者。可取二二呎×四二呎。容二床位者。可取一六呎×一六呎。皆因病室之大小。依每人應佔空間體積而定。卽每人至少應佔一〇〇〇立方呎。以每床位中心到中心八呎爲宜。牀之問可以屛隔之。平項高度以一〇呎六时爲宜。窗最好一呎寬。窗台離地板二呎六吋。上緣距平頂半呎走廊宽度可用八呎至一〇呎。</p>
<p>病室內射進之光綫。勿使直對病人之目。最好之方向。爲頭與兩窗所夾之牆能成乖直。</p>
<p>公共病室之外。尚須有小病室。以備有傳染病者住之，又設安靜室於其旁。以備怕人擾亂或具有能擾及其它病人之病者住之。其位置應近看護站。</p>
<p>（二）個人病室—個人病室之大小形狀。須使病人睹之不懨。可爲床位之外。留餘地以置桌椅。故以一〇呎×一六呎。一四呎×一六呎。或一二呎×一八呎爲宜。旁邊須設盥洗處及厠所。</p>
<p>（三）兒童病室—兒童病室之隔牆上部須裝有玻璃。以便易於照護。走廊之內亦須裝以玻璃。室內須漆以圖畫。以作裝飾。使兒童可有安慰。</p>
<p>（四）產婦病室—須有進門廳。而入接生室。（至少一二呎×一六呎）須述以消毒室及應用室。育嬰室之毘述。每日至少須有太陽一部。並須良好之自然通風。依面積言之。如產婦床位面積爲三〇。而每個小兒需要空間二〇〇至三〇〇立方呎時。則面積應以三×二三爲宜。溫度須保存八〇F。如爲防音起見以穿堂與走廊相隔爲佳。其附近須設膳室以備產婦及小兒之飲食。又須設小育嬰室。以備遇有傳染病之小見用之。</p>
<p>D（手術部）常位於高層。囚其光綫充足也。但亦有位於第一層者則應用大窗。手術部最重要部份爲主要手術室。約一八呎×二四呎。與次要手術室約一四呎×一六呎。平頂不可底於一二呎。以求空間之適合。窗之寬度以八呎爲宜。窗台高二呎六吋直抵平頂。窗上須有蔽光設備。因有時不准陽光之射入也。手術桌上設强電燈。其光綫之配置。須使無影之拋蔽。內部顏色最好用灰綠色之磁磗護牆。以上再以淡灰綠色漆之。地板貝以深灰綠色之磁磚舖之。但磚面不可太滑。近代手術室。多設有學生參觀處。其處在手術室之上層。距地板面僅七呎高。上有鞍坐一周。學生可由玻璃屛伏望手術桌上。其視綫正由身前之短牆緣射入。使下面人不致覺察。</p>
<p>每一手術室之旁當有消毒室。醫生洗濯室。此外附屬部份尚有麻醉室。看護婦工作室。小試騐室。醫生休息室。更衣室。厠所等等。麻醉室約一二呎×一六呎牆面應設以暖和之色。</p>

<p>— 朱枕木</p>
<p>（四）銅化——鎔解後所得之純銅，可放入銅化器中，加以少量之砂及生銅礦，用每英方吋十六磅之壓力，以空氣灌入液中。於是硫璜質乃化成二氧化硫，硫化鐵亦可成氧化鐵，而與砂合成浮渣。停止工作，取出浮渣。再吸空氣而提去硫化銅之硫質，於是可得純銅。</p>
<p>（五）凈鍊——雖銅化之後，已得純銅，而仍須加以净鍊，其法可用電力。電力净鍊，電極有並行及述貫之兩法排列，可任用一法。所用溶液爲硫酸銅，與少量硫酸之混合品。所用電力以大壓低爲宜，電量密度，以電極每平方英呎，得二十五安培爲度。電氣净鍊之後，陽極之銅塊，乃自氧化成Cu，過溶液而附上陰極，於是乃得眞正潔净之銅質。</p>
<p>第三節　銅之特性與効用</p>
<p>銅質軟而易展，色現微赤，其生銅之最高抵抗力爲每方英吋二萬五千磅。比例限度每方吋八千磅，伸長度達百分之七。其用快冷法者，最高抵抗力爲每方吋四萬磅，伸長度百分之三。　　銅之用度，其在建築界中，如電綫，窗飾，或製造各式合金，均有應用。</p>
<p>第七章　鋁</p>
<p>第一節　鋁之概述</p>
<p>考鋁之歷史，其當一八五〇年以前，尚屬稀少之金屬礦物，僅足供博物院之展覽，至一八八九年而方始有市塲買賣。其初次發現，係在一八二五年爲奧斯達突氏所檢定。當時值價甚昂，如磅達有一百二三十金元之譜，時至今每而祇需金洋一二角矣，蓋鋁之踪跡，滿佈地球各處據科學家所探測，全球地壳，約有百分之八爲鋁質，而鐵僅百分之五，故尚較生鐵之藏量爲富有也。惟鋁確無單純之礦苗，多與其他相雜，故亦必加冶練而方可得鋁，其最普通之礦苗，曰氧化鋁，西名曰Baurite，其所含雜質計有氧化鐵砂矽，等物，冶練時均宜提凈之。</p>
<p>第二節　鋁之鍊製</p>
<p>鋁之鍊製，因其爲適應大量之出產及供應，且求成本低降計，普通均用電力，而且非電力，不能使鋁質能純粹提得也。通常所慣用之鍊鋁方法，計有拜幼（Bayer）氏及霍爾（Hall）氏之兩法，茲分述如后，（未完）</p>

<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>關於築塲裏用</p>
<p>菉荳沙—大凡建築鋼骨水泥工程，其搆造方面是不可缺少水泥黃沙石子三者的成分。所以在近代建築事業日趨蓬勃的時候，對於水泥黃沙石子三者的產量，是佔有最重要的地位。但這菉荳沙（Grayel）究竟是什麽材料；它是一種較小的石片，性質和蒼蠅片略同。不過它的用途對於搗水泥大料和柱子等是不需要的，因爲它是不容易受到拉力和擠力的原因。可是它在搗窗盤（Windowsil）或烟囱帽子（Channel　Cap）等的地方是極爲倚重的。</p>
<p>晒步！一座扶梯的排法，有時因爲地位的關係，往往在中間成爲幾段的灣曲。在灣曲的地方。踏步板（Step）是難以鑲成整塊的。大概成功爲長三角形。這些長三角形的踏步板，就呌它晒步（Widing）</p>
<p>出風洞—出風洞是一種流通空氣的設備，大都在地籠墻靠外墻四周所留的四方形或長方形的小鐵橺。這就是出風洞（Ventilator）不過普通的街房之類是很少用出風洞的。在比較考究些的小洋房，其搆造上必有地籠，所以出風洞是免不掉的。</p>
<p>綫垂—（Plumb）一種可以觀察出墻身傾斜（卽「衝」「免」之謂）的東西。上面是用綫掛的形狀像猪的心肝。用法將綫垂牽綫的上端。用右手第一個大姆指和第二個指頭執牢，其餘三個指頭輕按在墻身上，綫垂本身是有重力的。至少離開墻身二三分，這時就用目光瞄準，在綫的直度上可以看出墻身的「衝「免」。所以這綫乖的用途，凡是築塲上至監工下至做手應該各人常備的。</p>
<p>做手！築塲裏不論泥水木匠，大凡在工作者，皆稱做手（WordMan）</p>
<p>督頭！石庫門的兩邊大頭（Lining）和墻身的外墻合角（Angle）大概在勒脚（Xurlin）的地位，另嵌一種蘇州石或其他石料，這種石呌督頭（Jamb）</p>
<p>山頭！墻的名稱甚多，大部份分（普通市房計算）砌在前面的呌前廊墻（或前詹墻，）砌在後面的呌後廊墻（成後詹墻，）砌在灶披間者呌做後披墻，還有一種前廊墻和後廊墻述帶的兩堵側墻，上端跟着屋面成二面坡度的就呌山頭（Jamb）其墻身就呌山墻。（Jamb　Wail）</p>

<p>Guiyang. Approximately 15,000 remnants of Zhu and Mao's communist bandits are fleeing towards Xun甸, appearing to be attempting to cross the Jinsha River. Chairman Chiang has ordered Liu Wenhui to deploy troops to intercept and suppress them. Xue Yue has already arrived in Pingyi. (Central News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Military News: (1) Hu Zongnan's division, on the afternoon of the 28th, breached the bandit positions at Motianling and are currently pursuing them towards Tangjiahe and Qingchuan. Furthermore, the right flank of the same unit, at Shen time on the 27th, attacked Pingwu and various nearby key passes. The bandits, unable to withstand the assault, retreated in disarray towards Qingchuan. (2) A large force of bandits has reinforced the area facing Dengjiadu in Mianyang. At 10 PM on the 27th, they attempted to construct five or six wooden rafts between Chuan渡口 and Luoquan Cliff to cover a forced crossing. However, our troops repelled them, killing over a dozen bandits. (Central News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Guiyang. Seeing that their path to flee west into Yunnan has been cut off by government forces, the communist bandits turned east towards Zhaoqing (transliteration) yesterday, where they were bombarded by government forces in the Baishui area. According to local authorities, over 300 bandits were killed, including a certain Yang, the political director of the Communist First Army. With their strength depleted, they fled north towards Qingyi (transliteration) and were attacked by other government forces, resulting in approximately 600 casualties. It is reported that the communist bandits have not received any news or orders from their Central Executive Committee since April 24th, leading to significant internal disarray. According to reports, government forces discovered members of the committee on a certain mountain path on April 24th. Local authorities now believe that all of them have been killed, including several Russians. Simultaneously, Chairman Chiang has approved the headquarters' suggestion to offer rewards for the capture of communist leaders. Yesterday, a member of the communist execution squad was executed at the headquarters here. This individual had been captured in recent battles and sentenced to death by a military tribunal. Chairman Chiang is currently in good health, and rumors of his illness are unfounded. Reports that Chiang flew to Yunnan are also inaccurate. (Reuters telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang, recognizing the fierce attacks by the First Route Army against the bandits in the Jiangzhong area, especially the courageous leadership of Gong, the brigade commander of that unit, who was seriously wounded while leading his troops, has not only provided 1,000 yuan for his medical expenses but also issued a circular telegram to all units, instructing them to take note of his bravery and encourage others. (Central News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Long Yun, the chairman of Yunnan, telegraphed the Beijing office on the 28th, stating that bandits who fled into the Yangjieying area on the 25th were attacked and killed, with four or five hundred dead, by our An brigade. The remnants scattered and fled in disarray. Qujing and Zhan益 are both peaceful, with no trace of bandits. (Special telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>Guiyang. Chairman Chiang visited Yangming Cave in Xiuwen on the afternoon of the 28th. In recent days, our forces have killed many bandits in the Zhan益 and Qujing areas. The two counties of Zhan and Qu are peaceful. (Central News Agency telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Guiyang. Wu Zhihui, Chen Bulei, Chen Cheng, and others arrived in Guiyang from Chongqing on the afternoon of the 28th. Due to Chairman Chiang's tour, they are waiting to pay their respects that evening or the next morning. (Central News Agency telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Guiyang. The rumors circulating in Shanghai about Chairman Chiang's ill health are now believed to be due to a misunderstanding caused by the illness of Tang, the deputy commander of the 93rd Division. Tang recently suffered from acute appendicitis, and Dr. Jin Telei, an American missionary doctor, came here from Chongqing on April 22nd to treat him. Outsiders mistakenly believed that he was treating Chiang. In fact, Chairman Chiang has been in excellent health recently. Since having several painful teeth extracted in Beijing in January, he has gained weight. Chen Cheng, Wu Zhihui, and Chen Bulei all arrived here today to confer with Chiang.

<p>(Nanchang) Military News: Mao Zetan, the pseudo division commander belonging to the pseudo Central Military Region (and younger brother of Mao Zedong), previously fled with his remnant troops to the northeastern mountains of Huangshankou, east of Ruijin, due to our military's active search and suppression efforts. On the 26th of this month, our Mao Bingwen unit's Tang regiment of the 24th division discovered him in that location. The bandit resisted arrest and was killed by our forces. At the same time, over a dozen pseudo political commissars and others were killed, over a dozen guns were seized, and many bandits were captured alive. According to their confessions, the bandit who resisted us and was killed was indeed Mao Zedong's corpse. It has now been carried into the city of Ruijin, to the joy of the people. Furthermore, it was learned that the Tang regiment of the 24th division, which killed the pseudo division commander Mao Zetan on the 26th, found photographs of the wives of the bandit leaders Zhu and Mao on his corpse, as well as tens of dollars in banknotes from the Central South Bank. The corpse was carried to Ruijin, greatly heartening the people. (Central News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 180th weekly memorial service at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Present were Central Committee members Ye Chu-cang, Deng Jia-yan, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Shi Ying, Li Zong-huang, Ji Liang, and all staff members, totaling approximately 600 people. Chairman Sun Ke, Deng Jia-yan reported on the proceedings of the memorial ceremony at the Huangdi Bridge Mausoleum, stating that he and Committee Member Shao, acting under the Central Government's orders, paid respects at the Huangdi Mausoleum. They arrived in Xi'an on the 3rd of this month and held the ceremony at Qiaoshan on the 7th, with solemn rituals. This was the first time since the founding of the Republic of China, so the general populace paid close attention and had a very good impression. After the Huangdi Mausoleum ceremony, they proceeded to the Zhou Mausoleum, Mao Mausoleum, Zhao Mausoleum, and other places to pay respects. Paying respects to the Huangdi Mausoleum is not a restoration of the past, because the Yellow Emperor is the ancestor of the nation and also a great creator, revolutionary, and hero who can pacify the country and resist foreign aggression. He has performed great deeds for the nation and the country, and later generations should worship and admire him as a warning. In addition to the government's annual cleaning and sweeping, it is especially important to (1) repair the Huangdi Mausoleum, (2) promote nearby production projects and roads, (3) reorganize the mausoleum's sacrificial fields, and (4) cultivate forests, among other things, to serve as a permanent memorial. After his speech, the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a weekly memorial service at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Present were Zhang Ji, 　 Yongjian, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Chen Daqi, Huang Musong, Ma Chaojun, Lin Xiang, Chen Zhuo, Chu Minyi, Lv Chao, Wei Huai and the seven regional supervisory envoys Ding Chaowu and other supervisory committee members Li Sicong, and staff members of various departments and commissions, totaling more than 600 people. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, the President of the Judicial Yuan reported, mainly stating that, after arduous efforts, the political situation in our country has now gotten on track, and progress is being made year by year. That is, the work of suppressing bandits has now reached the final stage of extermination. After military success, the construction of local politics is becoming more and more urgent, so the Control Yuan believes that the establishment of supervisory envoys in various regions is extremely important. The work of the Control Yuan is active, not passive. Political progress and strict supervision are particularly related to each other. It is hoped that the supervisory envoys in various regions, based on the meaning of establishing supervisory envoys and their tasks, from the perspective of the supervisory system and the actual political needs, will, when they depart and after arriving in various places, follow the teachings of the Generalissimo, promote the supervisory system, and work hard for the Party and the country. This is the most important work in building the Republic of China, and I hope that everyone will work hard to complete it, he said. (Central News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Seven Supervisory Envoys and One Supervisory Committee Member Jointly Sworn In; Zhang Ji of the Central Supervisory Committee Supervises Oath-Taking; Chairman Lin Bestows Seals of Office and Delivers Speech <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed seven regional supervisory envoys Ding Chaowu, Miao Peicheng, Chen Zhaoying, Gao Yihan, Fang Juehui, Zhou Lisheng, Dai Kuisheng, and Supervisory Committee member Li Sicong held a joint swearing-in ceremony on the morning of the 29th, after the National Government's weekly memorial service. Zhang Ji was sent by the Central Supervisory Committee to supervise the oath-taking. Important heads of various agencies attended the ceremony. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony and bestowed the seals of office, the oath-taking ceremony was held. Zhang Ji gave a speech, roughly stating that he was honored to participate in the joint swearing-in ceremony of the supervisory envoys and Committee Member Li, according to the order of the Central Supervisory Committee. The supervisory system has been in our country for thousands of years, and its organization was most complete in the Han and Ming dynasties. During the Han dynasty, there were thirteen provinces, each with a governor, as well as an inspector. The governor was in charge of the province's military and political power, while the inspector was in charge of investigating the political gains and losses, advantages and disadvantages, and the grievances and sufferings of the people. The governor's salary was 2,000 piculs, while the inspector's was 600 piculs, but the inspector's authority was not diminished because his salary was smaller. The establishment of discipline and the purification of politics in the Han and Ming dynasties were largely due to the competence of the inspectors and the touring censors. Although the Qing supervisory system was not perfect, the fact that the Qing dynasty's fate was able to continue to linger after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion was also due to the rectification of long-standing malpractices by the patrol envoys. Today, as the supervisory envoys are sworn in, I would like to cite the good regulations of the supervisory system in history to inform the supervisory envoys, so that they may have a standard. Finally, Zhang also said that the supervisory system is our country's inherent national essence and is also one of the five-power constitutions created by the Generalissimo. The supervisory envoys who have been ordered to take office this time are all important responsible comrades of our party. I hope that after taking office, they will establish discipline for the country and promote ideology for the party. Then, Chairman Lin gave a speech, roughly stating that the supervisory system is the only good system for maintaining national discipline and reducing the suffering of the people. It already exists in our country's history, and the Generalissimo has revitalized it. I hope that after taking office, the supervisory envoys will work hard to promote it with an iron-faced and selfless spirit, so that corrupt officials will hear the news and restrain their behavior, and the suffering of the people will gradually be reduced. At the end, he also hoped that the supervisory envoys would have a strict investigation of the candidates in various places, so that the superiors would not be implicated by their subordinates. The supervisory envoys pushed Ding Chaowu to respond, and in addition to expressing their respectful adherence to the oath and their commitment to carry out the instructions of Chairman Lin and the President of the Judicial Yuan, they also cited three things: to seek the people's hidden feelings, to not fear the powerful, and to encourage integrity, to encourage themselves and others. After the speech, they took a group photo and dispersed. (Central News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>

He made a statement to reporters, saying, "I have been in the north for more than two years and have long wanted to come to Shandong to inspect the province's construction. However, due to the cumbersome nature of the affairs, it has not been possible to fulfill this desire. Recently, the affairs have been simplified a little, so I have taken the time to come to Shandong to inspect, and I will also take the opportunity to inspect the troops stationed in Jinan. If time permits, I also plan to go to Qingdao to inspect the municipal situation. Chairman Han's achievements in governing Shandong are outstanding, and everyone knows it. Mayor Shen has also done a lot of construction in Qingdao. I believe that my trip to Shandong this time will definitely give me a very good impression. Chairman Chiang advocated the New Life Movement and the National Economic Construction Movement, which are necessary plans for modern countries. Chairman Han has always strongly advocated these two movements.

<h3 id="e16">The Sino-British Yunnan-Burma Boundary Demarcation Issue <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The issue of the Sino-British Yunnan-Burma border demarcation, which has been delayed for more than 30 years, has recently been resolved as a result of the exchange of notes between China and Britain. China and Britain will each send two commissioners, and the Administrative Council of the League of Nations will send a commissioner from a neutral country to serve as the chairman. Together, they will form the Yunnan-Burma Boundary Demarcation Commission to go to the undetermined boundary in the southern section to conduct a joint survey. Can the long-standing border dispute be resolved in part by this? Burma was originally a vassal state of our country, bordering Yunnan. In 1885, Britain annexed Burma. Not only was the Qing court unable to recover the territory, but it also concluded a treaty. Article 2 stipulated that "China agrees that Britain shall handle all political powers it currently holds in Burma at its convenience." Article 3 stipulated that "The Sino-Burmese border shall be jointly demarcated by commissioners sent by China and Britain." This not only handed Burma over to the British but also opened up the Yunnan-Burma border dispute, leading to foreign troubles within the domestic sphere. In 1898, China and Britain sent commissioners to jointly survey the Yunnan-Burma border. The section from the northernmost sharp mountain in Tengchong County, meandering south and east to the point where the Nanpa River in Zhenkang County flows into the Nanding River, has been determined. However, the area north of Jian Gaoshan has not been demarcated due to disputes between China and Britain. This is the undetermined boundary in the northern section. Jiangxinzha and Pianma are all within this section, which is vast in area and important in location. The section from the Nanding River south to the point where the Nanma River in Lancang County flows into the Maka River is the undetermined boundary in the southern section. Ban Hong, which China and Britain are paying attention to, is in this section. (See the local correspondence in the Shen Bao Monthly, Volume 3, Issue 10). The area is rich in mineral products and has long been coveted by the British. The recent joint survey to be conducted by China and Britain is this undetermined boundary in the southern section.</p>
<p>In 1899, according to Articles 3 and 4 of the Annex to the 1897 Sino-British Supplementary Agreement on Burma, our country sent Liu Wansheng, the magistrate of Tengyue, and Chen Can, the Daotai of Yunnan, to meet with the British representative Scott to jointly survey the undetermined boundary in the southern section. At that time, Xue Fucheng, our minister to Britain, had drawn a map and sent it to the Qing court, which was then issued by Liu Zhen and Chen Daotai to survey according to the map. From the Nanding River, following the mountain ridge and following Mount Gongming (also known as Mount Laiying) to the point where the Nanma River flows into the Nanka River, all the upper, middle, and lower Hulu tribes of Ban Hong were assigned to Yunnan, and all the areas belonging to Ban Kuang were assigned to Burma. However, Scott claimed that the latitude and longitude of the Xue map did not match the treaty and produced another map, running south and then east from the Nanding River, using Mount Kongming to allude to Mount Gongming, and assigning Ban Hong, Ximeng, Shao幸, Shao怕, and upper and lower Kunma (i.e., all the Hulu land) to Burma. The two sides argued and could not reach a decision, resulting in a pending case. As for the undetermined boundary in the northern section, Article 4 of the 1894 Sino-British Supplementary Treaty on Burmese Border Affairs stipulated that "After the situation in that area is clarified in more detail in the future, the two countries will demarcate the border again," so a joint survey has not yet been conducted. Under these circumstances, the frequent alarms over the past 30 years have been nothing more than the British invasion and occupation of Pianma, Jiangxinzha, and Ban Hong, Meng Dong, and Meng Jiao. If the Yunnan-Burma border is not resolved, our country's southwestern border will not have peace. The way to remedy this is to jointly survey and fairly demarcate the undetermined boundary so that both sides will forever abide by it to eliminate disputes.</p>
<p>Now that China and Britain have agreed to form a Boundary Demarcation Commission to demarcate the Yunnan-Burma border, the method is indeed commendable. However, only the undetermined boundary in the southern section will be demarcated this time, and the demarcation of the undetermined boundary in the northern section is not within the scope of the Commission's work. Therefore, at best, only the border dispute in the southern section of Yunnan-Burma will be resolved, and it will have nothing to do with the northern section. This is a major drawback. The situation in the undetermined boundary in the northern section is even more dangerous than the undetermined boundary in the southern section. Now that the Burma Railway has been extended to Myitkyina, and there is a road from Myitkyina directly to Pianma, and from Pianma directly to Kantilong, the British can use Jian Gaoshan to attack our Tengchong from the rear and then spy on our Xikang. This is something that our national defense must contend for. Therefore, we believe that while carrying out the demarcation of the undetermined boundary in the southern section, we should also request that the demarcation of the undetermined boundary in the northern section be carried out at the same time so that the Yunnan-Burma border issue, which has been pending for more than 30 years, can be completely resolved to strengthen our borders and eliminate future disputes.</p>

May 3rd is the official start date for the maneuvers, and the waters near Alaska will be the focus. There are also 460 aircraft participating in the maneuvers. (29th Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>San Diego, USA: The U.S. Navy is scheduled to hold grand maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean from May 3rd to June 10th, commanded by Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Leffers. A total of 164 warships and 450 aircraft will participate in the maneuvers. The maneuver program is kept secret, but it is expected to be a prolonged defense of the Aleutian Islands, with light fleets responsible for defense and main battleships attacking from the south. The naval fleet participating in the maneuvers is under orders not to sail within 3,200 kilometers of Japan. Finally, the fleet will maneuver in the waters off Honolulu before concluding. (29th Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) The U.S. fleet, consisting of 153 warships of various types, set sail from San Pedro tonight and will conduct six weeks of grand maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean. The ships followed the battleship Pennsylvania in single file, creating a magnificent military spectacle. The fleet is commanded by Admiral Leffers, with the Pennsylvania as the flagship. The maneuver area covers approximately five million square miles, starting from Alaska and ending at Midway Island. The main battleships are sailing towards the Hawaiian Islands, while some ships are heading to Puget Sound and the Aleutian Islands. After the main force arrives in Honolulu, it will be divided into two branches. One will continue to Midway Island to establish a temporary base for maritime aircraft, and the other will remain in Honolulu with about 50,000 personnel. Approximately 500 aircraft will participate in the maneuvers. These maneuvers will determine the U.S. Navy's ability to defend various key points. This is the first time that the U.S. Navy maneuvers have reached international borders. Midway Island, two small islands in the sea between North America and Asia, will be a key point in this strategy. Naval aircraft will use it as a fuel base. The aircraft may even fly near Wake Island, which is located to the southwest. President Luo placed this island under naval administration in his order. If aircraft fly from Midway Island to that location, warships will also follow. If so, it will be less than 500 miles from the Far Eastern territory of Japan, formerly belonging to Germany and now administered by Japan, the Marshall Islands. Midway Island is located between the Marshall Islands and the Hawaiian Islands. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e30">U.S. Navy Giant Aircraft Testing Combat Power <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Navy Department is maintaining strict secrecy regarding the testing of giant combat aircraft for first-line defense. One giant aircraft is currently undergoing its final test flight on the West Coast by naval officers to assess its combat effectiveness. Another will soon be test-flown in Norfolk. If the test flight results are satisfactory, the Navy Department may order 30 of these aircraft, costing $150,000 each, and it will take a year to build all of them. These aircraft can carry bombs and machine guns and are truly the most powerful weapons. Naval officials plan to organize a first-line defense air force with 30 of these aircraft to resist naval attacks. The aircraft being tested carries six machine guns and two tons of bombs, and can fly 3,000 miles in one go. According to current plans, after these aircraft are built, they will be distributed to the East and West Coasts, and some will be stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. These aircraft will certainly increase the United States' power to control the Pacific. Naval officers say that their initial intention was to develop these aircraft for reconnaissance and bombing. These aircraft should be able to fly 3,000 miles in one go. The aircraft being tested on the West Coast was manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Factory in Santa Monica, California. It has a wingspan of 100 feet, two 830-horsepower engines, and a fuselage that can accommodate eight people. The aircraft has already undergone preliminary testing. The aircraft was transported to the sea at dawn, and the surrounding area was heavily guarded, and onlookers were prohibited from taking photographs. It is said that the Navy Department will decide whether to proceed with its aircraft purchase plan after full testing in six days. All aircraft will not be delivered until the second half of 1936.

<p>(Washington) The bill for building six army aviation bases on the coasts of the American Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaska has been approved by the House Army Committee and reviewed by the Army Department. It is now learned that a clause must be added when the bill is finally passed, vaguely stipulating that a strong aviation base be built in the Great Lakes region of the United States bordering Canada. According to Deputy Chief of Staff Coalpoon, who recently declared to the House Army Committee, it is currently impossible to make people believe that it is necessary to fortify the Canadian border, but the Army Department believes that an airfield in the Great Lakes region is beneficial to the protection of border people.

<p>Ordering Twelve New Submarines; Possessing Long-Range Offensive Capabilities</p>
<p>(Paris) A London correspondent for the Morning Post claims that British officials expect the German government to deliver a note to the ambassadors of all signatory nations to the Treaty of Versailles in Germany today, announcing its naval shipbuilding program and stating that the German government has decided to immediately build twelve submarines, each with a displacement of 250 tons. (29th Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although local authorities refuse to comment on the rumor that Germany is violating the Treaty of Versailles and is currently engaged in building several submarines, according to reliable sources, the German government has ordered twelve submarines from the well-known Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg and the shipyards in Kiel and Stettin. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Express, the cabinet will soon discuss whether to protest to Germany over the construction of twelve submarines in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The Daily Telegraph's naval reporter, Belwarder, said that the submarines built by Germany are not purely defensive in nature, as the country claims, but actually possess long-range offensive capabilities, and their range of activity actually exceeds the Strait of Gibraltar. He also said that the 250-ton submarines currently being built by Germany may even have greater combat power than the submarines used in the European War. (29th Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) According to the diplomatic reporter of the Daily Telegraph, since learning that the British Air Force is far inferior to Germany's, great fear has arisen in British political circles. The cabinet is currently studying various plans to innovate the air force. The newspaper also said that the true meaning of Germany's efforts in aerial development lies in organizing an aircraft industry based on the entire country. The decline of the British aircraft industry is due to the inability to sell military aircraft and civilian long-distance aircraft. It is hoped that the British government will pay special attention to this matter. (29th Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Germany's recent active rearmament, especially in the air force and navy, is causing considerable fear here, as can be seen from the editorials in this morning's newspapers. The Times stated that the news of Germany building submarines surprised the cabinet. The British cabinet had already received news two weeks ago that Germany had completed the assembly of various submarine parts manufactured last winter according to the plan set last year, and now the government has ordered them to be completed immediately. As Britain and Germany will hold a naval conference at the beginning of next month, it is no wonder that the government is greatly surprised that Germany has suddenly announced the construction of submarines before the naval conference. In short, Hitler has always believed that the military clauses in Part V of the Treaty of Versailles can no longer bind Germany. This announcement of the construction of ships prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles is also to show that Germany is no longer bound by the military clauses of the treaty. The Daily Telegraph stated, "The situation created by Germany's implementation of naval rearmament will not change British foreign policy, but British defense plans must be modified. Because Germany has made this decision regardless of everything, Britain's efforts to seek European security solely through international agreements are insufficient, and it must seek other methods to guarantee peace." The Morning Post stated, "The German Ministry of Defense's denial of building a navy shows Hitler's efforts to seek the sympathy of Britain. Although the British people are indifferent to events on the European continent, they cannot ignore Germany's revival of its navy. This is well known to Hitler. Whether Britain can establish a naval agreement with Germany to replace the naval clauses in the treaty, so that Germany's rearmament of its navy becomes legitimate, must be decided. If Britain's purpose is to establish a naval agreement with Germany, other naval powers that signed the Washington and London naval treaties will inevitably oppose it, especially France; however, in short, if British politicians continue to propose such methods without increasing their own national defense, the British-German talks will not only be useless but also harmful."

<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull is unwilling to criticize the report from London that Germany's naval construction plans are tearing up the Treaty of Versailles. Hull said today that there is still no "official news," so it would be completely "inappropriate" for the United States to issue an official statement. General observers in the United States believe that this move by Germany has violated the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, so if the United States lodges a protest, it will be based on this. According to the Associated Press, a senior spokesman for the German Navy stated that Germany believes that the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles regarding land, sea, and air forces have long been invalid, so the German government's plan to rebuild the navy is to obtain the final "security." As for the London news, it is said that the Anglo-German naval talks will continue according to the original procedure. Today, according to reliable sources, the French Minister of the Navy will visit London at the beginning of next week. The government has also made an official announcement that the Minister of the Navy's daughter is getting married in London, hence this trip. However, the general public believes that the true purpose of this trip is related to the naval talks. (28th Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Observations of the Japanese Naval Authorities on the Future of the Naval Conference <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The naval disarmament issue has been completely stalled since the breakdown of the preparatory consultation in December last year. Recently, the European political situation has greatly changed. Britain advocates inviting Germany and Russia to participate in the disarmament conference, while the United States hopes to postpone the meeting. The situation is gradually becoming complicated. The Japanese naval authorities attach importance to the future. The various situations regarding the naval disarmament conference recently are generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Comparison of naval forces of European countries:</p>
<p>Britain: 1.25 million tons, France: 660,000 tons, Italy: 420,000 tons, Soviet Russia: 210,000 tons, Germany: 110,000 tons.</p>
<p>Although Soviet Russia has more than double the tonnage of Germany, Germany's warships are mostly new, so their forces are equal.</p>
<p>(2) Germany wants to obtain 35% of Britain's naval armament (i.e., 440,000 tons), but Britain intends to oppose it for fear of insufficient strength in the North Sea. However, due to air force and other factors, Britain cannot but recognize Germany's acquisition of 15%.</p>
<p>(3) France is most afraid of Germany's expansion of armaments. If Britain recognizes Germany's possession of more than 200,000 tons, then France will also expand its strength to be able to confront it.</p>
<p>(4) The purpose of Britain's invitation to Germany and Russia to participate in the conference seems to be to break through its predicament. However, its future has a significant relationship with the European political situation and can control the fate of the disarmament conference. (29th Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The impact of Germany's rearmament on the upcoming formal disarmament conference is viewed by the Japanese naval authorities as follows: If Britain recognizes Germany's demand for 35% of Britain's 440,000 tons, it will be equal to Britain's strength, so it will definitely reject its demand. This is because Britain has recently gradually shifted from the two-power standard to the three-power standard. That is, if Germany is recognized for 440,000 tons, then the combined 660,000 tons of France and 420,000 tons of Italy will reach 1.52 million tons, which will surpass Britain's possession of 1.25 million tons and fundamentally overturn the three-power standard, so it will definitely not agree to give it 35%. From this point of view, Britain will certainly oppose reducing its current possessions, and the Japanese government's fundamental disarmament policy, which calls for stipulating the maximum common holdings and reducing holdings, will also fall into a position of being unable to comply. France has always advocated maintaining the state of the Washington Treaty in terms of its superiority over Germany. Coupled with the fact that the United States insists on its own views, the next disarmament conference, given the current state of affairs in European countries, has even less hope of success.

It is also reported that the British cabinet is currently divided into three factions: one faction siding with Germany, one faction siding with France, and one faction remaining neutral. Even if the Anglo-German naval conference next week can reach a compromise, the discord in the British cabinet, the development of the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty, and the ill will of France and Italy towards Germany will all reduce Britain's chances of successful mediation.

<p>Changing the current military system is a prerequisite; the principle of revising the treaty should be maintained; Italy, Austria, and Hungary are scheduled to meet early next month for discussion</p>
<p>(Rome) The governments of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Tripartite Protocol of March 17 last year, will hold a meeting in Venice on May 4. The purpose is to discuss the position to be adopted at the nine-nation Danube Conference. This meeting of the three countries was initiated due to several questions raised by the Hungarian government. Hungary has proposed three demands regarding the Danube Convention:</p>
<p>(1) The principle of revising the treaty should be maintained. Any movement to revise the treaty should not be regarded as a violation of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.</p>
<p>(2) The rights of minorities should be defined. If minorities submit applications to protect their due rights, these applications should not be regarded as violations of the non-interference in internal affairs agreement.</p>
<p>(3) Hungary's signing of the non-interference in internal affairs agreement should be conditional on changing the current military system as a prerequisite. It is generally believed that the Italian government advocates that, before the opening of the nine-nation Danube Conference, Italy, Austria, and Hungary should first study the above-mentioned proposals by the Hungarian government in order to determine a common position for the three countries. In addition to signing the non-interference in internal affairs agreement, the nine-nation Danube Conference is also expected to have the nine countries mutually sign a bilateral mutual assistance agreement to ensure the implementation of the non-interference in internal affairs agreement. Regarding this, Hungary has indicated that it is feasible for Italy and Austria to sign a mutual assistance agreement, but Hungary intends to sign a relatively easier treaty with other related countries.

<p>(Paris) Mr. Barrère, a well-known diplomat who previously served as the Director of the Political Department of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs before the European War and is now retired, recently wrote an article published in the Revue des Deux Mondes. It states that when Campbell saw British Emperor George at Windsor Palace on February 1, 1913, the Emperor told him that Prince Henry of Prussia, the German Emperor's brother, had recently visited England on a diplomatic mission and subtly revealed that Austria and Russia might resort to arms, and Germany was determined to intervene militarily. Prince Henry then asked the Emperor whether Britain would participate. The Emperor replied that he would certainly participate in certain circumstances. Prince Henry was very surprised to hear this, saying that the possibility of a British-German war was something that Berlin never dreamed of. The British Emperor replied that, in order to respect honor, we must remain loyal to our allies. Barrère also said that in 1913, the French Commissioner in Cairo spoke with Lord Kitchener.

<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that there will be no change in the silver price of 77.57 cents before tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, senior officials from the United States and Mexican governments discussed the silver situation here for an hour. After the meeting, neither side was willing to announce the content of the talks, but said that another meeting would be held in the future. Representing the Mexican government were Mexican Undersecretary of Finance Lopez and Mexican Ambassador to the United States Roé. Representing the United States were Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Treasury Undersecretary Oliphant, and State Department Economic Advisor Feis. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently conferred with Roberto, an aide to the Mexican Treasury Secretary, on the silver issue. Discussions will continue thereafter. It is generally believed that Lopez has made a request to the United States government, saying that the United States' silver purchasing process should proceed slowly. Lopez came here by plane from Mexico, accompanied by Rockhill, the commercial counselor of the US Embassy, after the Mexican government announced the withdrawal of silver coins and the prohibition of silver coin exports, in order to confer with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on the silver issue. (Havas dispatch, 28th) Mexico officially announced today that the Bank of Mexico will reopen on Monday and will continue to sell drafts without restrictions at a rate of 3.60 pesos per US dollar. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) The London financial community is extremely concerned about the US silver purchasing policy and the repercussions it has caused. The recent decision of the Mexican government to completely withdraw silver coins circulating in the market and replace them with paper money proves that the US authorities' policy of raising silver prices is extremely dangerous for silver standard countries. The Mexican government is deeply afraid that after the silver price rises, the country's silver coins will flow out of the country, creating a temporary phenomenon of currency contraction. Therefore, it has no choice but to take measures to withdraw silver coins. China is in a position as serious as Mexico's. According to speculation in the London financial community, the Chinese government is now planning to strengthen control over Chinese commercial banks, so that they will store silver and issue paper money. In the future, it also plans to implement nationalization of silver. In short, the serious situation created by the US monetary miscalculation may force the Chinese government to change its banking and currency system, so that it can be centrally managed by the central government. Some people believe that this policy of the Chinese government can achieve the expected results. In the future, China will no longer borrow money from international or Japanese sources, and its finances can be easily managed. As for India, the situation is different. Although the rupee used in India is a silver coin, its price fluctuates with the pound sterling. After the silver price rises, the actual price of the rupee exceeds the face price. Therefore, those who hold rupees will sell the silver coins and buy pound sterling, causing the price of the pound sterling to rise. The British government's policy of suppressing the price of the pound sterling in order to develop foreign trade will be greatly affected as a result. In short, people in the London financial community believe that if this situation continues to develop, it will inevitably affect the monetary economy of most countries and produce serious consequences.

<p>Remarks by US Congressmen</p>
<p>(Washington) Congressman Day, one of the initiators of the silver purchase bill, discussed the current situation today, saying that the current silver policy of the authorities will eventually promote international currency stability. The United States' move to increase the value of domestic mined silver to 77.57 cents is now absorbing the liquid supply of silver in the world. Many countries have almost no gold, while the United States has half of the world's gold. It is difficult to manage a currency that is not based on precious metals well, and all countries in the world know this. Now that the United States has absorbed all the silver it can get, some other countries have to raise silver prices to prevent the outflow of silver. The US silver price will eventually be 1.29 dollars. Such competition is difficult to sustain, because some other countries need silver more urgently than the United States. If they currently allow the United States to purchase their silver, they will inevitably have to purchase silver back from the United States in the future. Therefore, they would rather pay a higher price to prevent the outflow of capital. This is inevitable. In the end, the entire matter will be resolved at the International Monetary Conference, which is what President Roosevelt wants. He personally believes that this conference will definitely reach an agreement to establish a global bimetallic system with a ratio of gold to silver of 16 to 1. Congressman Summers, Chairman of the House Currency Committee, said that the US silver price has increased too sharply, as can be seen from the current situation in Mexico. The silver price should be increased gradually so as not to disrupt the general financial situation too much. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and his staff are closely monitoring the world's reaction to the US policy and are prepared to continue discussions with Mexican Undersecretary of Finance Lopez. It is believed that the Mexican government will ask the United States to moderate its silver purchase policy. Lopez came here from Mexico in order to personally study everything. He told reporters today that the United States and Mexico have found a way to cooperate on this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Criticism from London Newspapers</p>
<p>(London) Today, newspapers here continue to criticize the US silver policy, all saying that the US authorities are embarrassed by the results of their own policy. People in the London financial community refer to this policy as chaotic behavior that does not consider future impacts. According to news from New York, the US silver policy aims to prevent the pound sterling from continuing to fall or to force the world to hold an international monetary conference in order to adopt a bimetallic system. London financial reporters do not believe that the US policy can achieve this goal. Moreover, the United States has not purchased silver on foreign markets in the past half month, so the inside story of the US government's policy is even more dubious. The Morning Post said that if there is a danger of a sharp drop in silver prices, the United States will enter the market for policy reasons and maintain it. The Times said that even if the US Treasury Department decides to reduce or temporarily moderate purchases on foreign markets, silver prices may not fall sharply, because speculators believe that the United States will continue its silver policy. A reaction of taking profits is bound to occur at any time. Permanent changes in the silver market can only occur after the United States completely changes its policy. The reaction of China to the US policy has not yet been heard. How things will turn out is of great concern. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Roosevelt Urges National Cooperation to Promote the Work Relief Plan and Says That the Atmosphere of Recovery is Strong <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) In a radio address from the White House, President Roosevelt asked the people of the country to ensure that this unprecedentedly large economic program in the world is truly successful, saying that the work relief responsibility he bears is the same for the American people, without allowing for partisan or political differences. However, it must be acknowledged that such large-scale undertakings, implemented in more than 3,000 towns across the country, may have inefficient management, mismanagement, or abuse of funds, and those who criticize it may use this to claim that the entire plan has failed. It should be known that any major undertaking is bound to have some shortcomings, and no class can guarantee that there will be no faultfinders. The most effective way to eliminate these abuses is for the American people themselves to take serious action. He asked the people of the country to cooperate with him to make this public undertaking, which is rare in the world, a model of efficiency and integrity. The government will do its best to use these funds to relieve unemployment. This is the nation's war to eliminate forced idleness, and it contains no other colors or discrimination. President Roosevelt also stated the legislative program he plans to implement during this congressional session, the main ones being the expansion of the National Recovery Administration, the elimination of non-essential public utility silver companies, the implementation of the new banking bill, and the passage of the economic security program. President Roosevelt elaborated on his idea of extending the work of the Recovery Administration, saying that we must continue to protect children, enforce minimum wage systems, prevent excessive working hours, and protect collective bargaining. President Roosevelt advocated for the speedy passage of improvements to the Federal Reserve System, saying that this system has proven its value in the past 20 years. President Roosevelt concluded by saying that the United States has gone through all kinds of hardships, and now still has the confidence to overcome the future. Panic is gradually decreasing, credit is gradually recovering, and there is now a definite atmosphere of recovery. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) Wall Street believes that President Roosevelt's radio address is the president's last force to promote the recovery movement. The financial community here believes that if there is no effect after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the work relief plan, uncontrollable inflation may be realized. Some sectors are quite disappointed that the president did not mention the gold and silver issue. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) In a radio address from the White House tonight, President Roosevelt stated the six basic principles for the distribution of 4.88 billion dollars in work relief funds as follows: (1) The projects to be undertaken must be beneficial; (2) The majority of these funds must be used for wages; (3) Part of the cost must benefit the central government in the future; (4) The funds for each project must be used in the next fiscal year; (5) The project plans must provide work for those awaiting relief; (6) Projects should be distributed in various places according to the number of workers awaiting relief.

<h3 id="e92">Japanese Immigration to Eastern Hebei; First Batch of 1,000 People to Immigrate by July; Aiming to Create a Mixed Sino-Japanese-Korean Area <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Japanese immigration to Eastern Hebei is currently being actively pursued. This matter is being handled by the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan and the Japanese Consulate-General in Tianjin, in accordance with the orders of its military headquarters, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A general immigration headquarters has been established in Shanhaiguan, with branch offices in Tangshan, Changli, Luanxian, Leting, and other places, each carrying out its responsibilities. The general and branch offices have hired the heads of local Japanese and Korean residents' associations, presidents of chambers of commerce, and presidents of veterans' associations to assist in the implementation of all plans. The first batch is scheduled to immigrate 1,000 people this year in July, designated to live along the railway line. Those who engage in industry and commerce will be introduced and guided by the Immigration Department. Three months after the first batch of immigrants, depending on the results and management, the second and third batches will be immigrated. The Japanese Consulate-General in Tianjin, in order to handle this matter, recently sent Consul An to inspect various places in Eastern Hebei. The Japanese consulates and police branches in Changli, Tangshan, Shanhaiguan, and Qinhuangdao, and the Japanese police branches in Leting, Miyun, and other places, have all increased personnel a week ago to carry out work, investigate the economy and commerce, and plan residential areas. For a time, the work was quite tense. Among the first batch of immigrants, it has been decided that 600 will be Japanese, mostly residents of Kyushu and Shikoku Islands, and 400 will be Koreans, from poor households in Hamgyong North and South Provinces and Gangwon Province. The purpose is to make Eastern Hebei an area of mixed Sino-Japanese-Korean residence in an invisible way. In reality, they want to make the area along the Beining Railway a continuation of the South Manchuria and Anfeng appendages, and connect it with the puppet state of Manchuria. In Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, we have no international organizations, and Japanese and Korean people come and go freely. Although Changli, Tangshan, and other places are not treaty ports, the Japanese have set up consulates and police stations. Local officials are afraid of trouble and allow them to carry out their wishes at will. Therefore, there is no way to stop this Japanese immigration to Eastern Hebei this time. This year, Japanese and Korean people have been entering Shanhaiguan, Qinhuangdao, Changli, Leting, Tangshan, and Tanggu in succession, and the number is uncountable. Even in Lulong, Zunhua, Yutian, Fengrun, Qian'an, and Jixian, which are the hinterland of the war zone, the number of Japanese and Korean households and population has also increased since the beginning of spring. Committing crimes and violating the law often makes it difficult for the security authorities to handle. If the Japanese implement their immigration plan within the war zone in July of this year, I do not know what it will be like. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Harbin; Rapid Development of Japanese Businesses <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Since the Illegal Transfer of the East China Railway; Japanese Population Soars to 30,000; Bankruptcies of Chinese Businesses Increase Proportionally</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the illegal transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the number of Japanese people in Harbin has greatly increased. At the end of last year, there were only 16,000 people, but now it has increased to 30,000. Due to the sharp increase in the Japanese population in Harbin, the business of Japanese stores has also become more prosperous. Therefore, the development of Japanese commerce in Harbin is quite astonishing. The turnover of small merchants has increased by about three times compared to the same period last year. This is due to the rapid development of Japanese commerce after the illegal transfer of the East China Railway. However, on the reverse side, Chinese commercial firms are gradually falling into distress, and have become increasingly depressed. In recent months, there has been an endless stream of closures and bankruptcies. Moreover, due to the increase in railway freight rates by the puppet organization, oil mills, water mills, and lumber merchants are all on the verge of bankruptcy. Further, the increase in the business tax by the puppet organization has caused many capitalists with large sums of money to withdraw their funds. Wealthy merchants from Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and other places in Harbin have mostly closed their businesses and transferred their capital to the interior. Therefore, the puppet organization has also strictly restricted the remittance of funds by wealthy merchants. These merchants really cannot bear the trampling of the Japanese puppets, and mostly wish to get rid of the harsh rule and return to their hometowns. However, the Japanese in Harbin have an unusually strong sense of patriotism. They all shop at Japanese stores and, except when unavoidable, never trade with Chinese merchants. The crisis of the complete annihilation of Chinese merchants in Harbin and the rapid development of Japanese commerce are directly and inversely proportional. The lifeline of our Chinese commerce will be seized and exhausted by the Japanese. (Northeast Press)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Fujian Province; Relief for Industry and Commerce; Chamber of Commerce Organizes Relief Financial Committee <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The commercial market in Fujian was previously affected by money houses recalling bills and stopping loans, resulting in a severe stagnation of funds. Therefore, the county chamber of commerce, banking groups, and the provincial government jointly discussed relief methods. It was agreed that the banking groups would release 1 million yuan in loans, and the chamber of commerce would organize a relief financial committee to accept loans from the banking groups and pass them on to reputable money houses for lending to the industrial and commercial sectors to facilitate turnover. Currently, the relief financial committee has been organized, with Luo Mianhou, Song Jingyan, Hong Fasui, Qiu Yisheng, Wan Jianru, Huang Rutaotao, and Liu Aiqi as members. Henghe and Commercial have also been designated as the two money houses for issuing loans, and 400,000 yuan from the Central Bank, 400,000 yuan from the Bank of China, and 200,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications have been allocated and submitted to the head office for approval. However, many days have passed and no approval from the head office has been received, so the funds cannot be released. At this time of year, the tea and timber industries are just beginning to harvest and transport, and industrial and commercial manufacturers are hoping for early implementation to facilitate market circulation. Yesterday, the county chamber of commerce again asked the provincial government to send a quick telegram to Finance Minister Kong to expedite the previous proposal and avoid prolonged waiting. The results of rural loans are still good. In the 23rd year, 100,000 yuan was allocated from the provincial treasury and 100,000 yuan was loaned by the Agricultural Bank of China. Currently, rural loans for the 24th year have begun to be processed, but the provincial treasury is short of funds and has no funds to allocate. Huo Er, Director of the Rural Financial Relief Office, went to Hankou to discuss with the general office of the Farmers' Bank and agreed to re-loan 300,000 yuan to the Rural Relief Office. According to the severity of the disaster in each county, they will be distributed based on the degree of urgency. Each county can receive more than 10,000 yuan or as little as several thousand yuan. Staff will be sent to the border counties in northwestern Fujian within days to guide farmers and organize mutual aid societies as borrowing institutions. Regarding the tea and timber production, which are most closely related to the province's economy, both have declined in recent years. Tea has decreased from 300,000 boxes to 200,000 boxes in the past three years, and pine timber has decreased from 12,000 linked units to over 7,000 in the past three years. The difference in amount is about one-third. Tea and timber merchants bear too heavy a tax burden, which is one of the reasons why trade cannot develop. A special request was submitted to the Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, requesting that the provincial government be consulted on whether to reduce or exempt the special business tax on the tea industry and the temporary defense donation for timber rafts to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The provincial government has approved a reduction of 30% of the timber raft defense donation, and the tea business tax is difficult to reduce temporarily until compensation can be arranged. Regarding the timber industry, sales of Fujian timber have been excellent recently due to very little timber from North China and the Northeast being transported into the interior, and prices have also risen slightly, which can provide some relief. As for the tea industry, since 50,000 boxes have been transported from northern and eastern Fujian to the province since the beginning of spring, domestic and foreign sales are sluggish, and most of them are piled up in warehouses in the Panfu area on the south bank of the Min River, the future is very pessimistic.

<h3 id="e95">Troops Stationed in Chaozhou and Meixian Cooperate to Suppress Scattered Bandits on the Fujian Border <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Li Mo'an, the pacification commander of the Second District of western Fujian, mobilized six regiments of elite troops to search for remnants of bandits in various counties in western Fujian. Wherever the army arrived, the remnant bandits were defeated at the mere sight of them. Zhang Dingcheng, the bandit leader, led the pseudo-Eighth and Ninth Regiments, as well as independent battalions and guerrillas, to flee to the Xianghu Mountains in Heping County on the Guangdong border, occasionally harassing Dachang and Xiaochang in Dapu County. Chen Shaowu's regiment, which was stationed in Dapu County, sent troops to guard Huliaozhangxi and other places. Now, the bandits are entrenched in Xiaobian, not far from Dachang, and there is a tendency to advance and disturb the Han River. The village chiefs of Dachang have jointly telegraphed the military commanders stationed in the area to send troops to be stationed there to pacify the area. Miao Peinan, the Chief of Staff of the First Army Group, took leave in mid-month to return to his hometown of Wuhua to visit relatives. He took the opportunity to go to Meixian to discuss with Huang Renhuan the method of suppressing the Min bandits, and will be able to go to Chao'an within days to discuss with Deng Longguang's division commander the military secrets of preventing and suppressing the Min bandits. Each army has been preparing to dispatch troops. The bandit nest in Baishui Lake, Phoenix Mountain, Raoping, was attacked by Zhang Guangquan's battalion stationed in Pengxi on the 15th, killing bandits. Knowing that they could no longer stay in Baishui Lake, more than 200 bandits fled to Zhao'an, Fujian, on the evening of the 18th. Currently, many remnant bandits from western Fujian have sneaked into the territory of Chaozhou, mostly gathering in Nanshan, Sangpu Mountain, and Beishan, and have secretly set up institutions in various cities, hoping to cause riots and disturbances. Li Peihua, the captain of the Chao'an County military team, discovered that the Chifen had secretly set up a pseudo-Chao-Cheng-Jie Revolutionary Committee in Dazhai Township, Seventh District. On the morning of the 22nd, he sent a team to encircle and search. When the bandit party saw that things were revealed, they threw bombs to resist arrest. After a fierce battle lasting three hours, the bandit organization was extinguished, and two female bandits, Cai Qiaoxiang and Chen Xixiang, and one male bandit, Liao Yijiao, were captured. Chen Atu, the pseudo-county committee member, was killed. A pseudo-revolutionary committee seal, Mauser pistols, bombs, and many reactionary propaganda items were seized from the bandit's nest. It is heard that bandits have secretly set up institutions in various counties. The Shantou Public Security Bureau conducts a household registration check once a month, and has now temporarily commissioned detective officials as special household registration inspectors. All households in various streets and alleys, if they are suspected households, can be inspected at any time, so that bandits have no way to stay. In order to suppress the remnants of bandits in various counties, long-distance telephones in various counties in the eastern district are limited to be erected and completed by the end of this month. The Meizhou telephone network is connected to Xingning, the Huizhou telephone network is connected to Heyuan, and the Chaozhou telephone network is connected to Chao'an. The General Headquarters sent technician Cai Dongpei to set up a general exchange in three places, and connect them to each other at the same time. Once a bandit police alarm or a Chifen action occurs, troops can be sent to block and intercept them at any time. It is necessary to search out all the remnant bandits in various counties within a short period of time.</p>

<p>Fan Lei (Xin Zhi), Director of the Fourth Public Security Branch, was accused by people in Xili in November of this year for failing to issue tickets for gambling cases. After receiving the order from the Civil Affairs Department to investigate, County Chief Yan immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and truthfully reported the case. Yesterday, the province ordered the county government to the effect that the branch director had detained the district secretary on suspicion of abusing his public office for private purposes, and that the presentation of criminal cases had been delayed for many days without reason, which was especially inappropriate. He was ordered to be dismissed first, and the vacant position was ordered to be filled by the bureau in accordance with the regulations. As for the fact that he privately collected gambling fines and did not issue tickets, it is not without real suspicion, and the case was sent to the court for investigation and legal action.</p>

<p>Zhang Jinfu, a villager from Zhangqiaotou in the third district of the county, made a good living by rowing boats, so he was coveted by bandits. At 2:00 AM the other night, more than forty bandits suddenly came, armed with guns, iron bars, and other weapons. They climbed over the wall and entered the bedroom, where they tied up Jin's wife, Shen, on the bed with ropes, forcing her to reveal the hiding place of the silver and forbidding her to make any noise. Then they rummaged through the boxes and arbitrarily searched, and after getting their loot, they opened the door and left with a roar. It is estimated that they were robbed of gold and silver jewelry, cash, clothes, etc., worth about 300 yuan.</p>

<p>The other night (the 26th), Wang's house in Zoujiawan, Beigou Township, was suddenly robbed by bandits. The bandits numbered about ten, mostly armed with sharp blades and other weapons, but no guns. After entering the house, the bandits used various vicious means to coerce the victims, but they were detected. The bandits had no guns, so the crowd was immediately gathered and surrounded the bandits, capturing seven bandits on the spot. The Gangkou Public Security Bureau was informed and sent police to take them back for questioning. They confessed to their names: Xu Baokang, Shao Zhongyuan, Chen Fengxiang, Wang Fuxiang, Wang Manquan, Cai Baozhong, Xie Yongbao, and confessed to robbing Xu's house in Daba Township on January 30th of this year, Zhang Qijing's house in He Zhang on February 1st, Song Chushi's house in Langang Bridge on February 12th, Liu Ji's house in Anzhuang Township on February 25th, the Li Taitang Temple in Langshi Bridge on March 17th, Xie Qi Ding Fuyun's house on April 1st, Xu Kanglin's house and Miao Xiaodi's house in Rangtang Township on April 15th, and Zhang Qi Guan's house in Zhang Qi Township on April 18th.

<p>This port is the salt sales center market for counties such as Jiading. The monthly sales are no less than several thousand piculs. Recently, due to the lack of vehicles, salt transportation has been slow, resulting in the sale of all salt in stock and an unprecedented salt famine. For the past month, salt prices have soared from eleven jin per yuan to five and a half jin. According to recent investigations, only a few dozen bags remain in retail stores throughout the city. Purchases are now limited to half a jin per person. If no more salt arrives within days, there is a danger of having to eat tasteless food.</p>

<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London gold prices today (29th) fell by 10.5 pence due to the high exchange rate of the pound, to 144 shillings and 5.5 pence.</p>
<p>The London silver market was very volatile this morning. At closing, the spot price was 34.0625 pence and the futures price was 34.1875 pence, both down 1.0625 pence. Speculators were both buying and selling.</p>
<p>Mount Lyell silver opened today with futures falling by 180 to 200 pounds, but trading was light. It then fell another 50 pounds.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The British-American London foreign exchange market was stable today. The British pound had an upward trend. The British-American exchange rate opened at $4.8325, higher by .125 than the US-UK closing rate on Saturday, and higher by 1.25 cents than the previous British-American price. At 11:00 it fell by .0625, then the price gradually rose. At 2:00 PM, the price was $4.833125, up .375 from the opening. Also, one US dollar equaled 4 shillings and 1.657 pence.</p>
<p>The British-French exchange rate opened at 73 francs and 12 centimes, higher by 21 points than the closing rate on Saturday. At 11:00 it fell by 5 points, after which the price recovered. At 2:00 PM, the price was 73 francs and 12 centimes, the same as the opening price.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>The New York cotton market opened today (29th) down 6 points. Within the first hour, it fell by 11 points. There was no significant trading activity. The decline in foreign cotton markets caused long positions here to be closed, thus affecting the market situation.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat saw rain in the drylands, and prices fell slightly, but the opening decline was not severe. Trading was limited, and the market was unexciting.</p>
<p>Liverpool wheat: Reports of rain in American wheat regions caused selling in the Liverpool wheat market today. At 1:00 PM, the July futures price was 5 shillings and 6.75 pence, down 1.125 pence from the Saturday closing.</p>

<p>New York opened today down 10 points, mainly due to the brewing labor unrest.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>The New York market opened in disarray this morning, with uncertain sentiment. President Roosevelt's broadcast address regarding legislation to manage public utility companies and abolish public utility holding companies failed to improve sentiment. Public utility stocks, therefore, opened lower and showed weakness. Industrial stocks saw some buying due to positive prospects, but the current uncertainty ultimately hampered the rise. However, the declines were insignificant. Silver mining stocks were the most active, but with the sharp drop in silver prices, sentiment was not very positive. Although some viewed President Roosevelt's broadcast address last night as favorable to long positions, the uncertainty in the silver market had a greater impact.

<p>Interbank Lending Indirectly Aids Industry and Commerce; Money Shops Permitted to Extend Loans with Increased Interest; National Products Groups and City Federation Representatives Petition</p>
<p>Today is the final day for the long-term loans related to the "Four Bottoms" deadline for the industrial and commercial sectors. Due to the major banks such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications providing interbank lending for assistance in recent days, and with the industrial and commercial sectors and money shops having made proper prior arrangements, extensions with increased interest have been granted. Therefore, yesterday's situation was very peaceful. Apart from the foreign interbank rate rising from 15% to 18%, there were no other unsettling conditions. Thus, according to sources in the banking and money shop sectors, this "Four Bottoms" deadline can hopefully be weathered safely.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Reaches Eight Million</p>
<p>The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks, in assisting with the "Four Bottoms" difficulty, have implemented interbank lending. Since the 23rd of this month, including old loans extended, the total has reached around eight million yuan. After adjustments by the three banks, the market has largely stabilized. Yesterday, on the eve of the "Four Bottoms" deadline, although there were several firms in this city requesting mortgage-backed lending, the amount was small, only two to three hundred thousand yuan. Other banks also made some sporadic small loans. According to sources at the Bank of Communications, the loan distribution method for the joint interbank lending by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, etc., was originally based on a 4-4-2 system. This year's lending has been changed to a 3-3-3 system, meaning that the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Bank of Communications share the responsibility equally. (Shen Shi News Agency)</p>
<p>Bankers Association Urges Discussion of Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association, based on the resolution of the 66th Executive Committee meeting on the 27th, sent a letter to the Central Bank yesterday, outlining the progress of handling small industrial and commercial credit loans and the amount raised. A subcommittee has been formed, hoping that the Central Bank will set a date to convene a meeting. The Bankers Association's subcommittee will nominate committee members Ye Fuxiao (Continental Bank) and Wang Yansong (Silk Industry Bank) to attend and participate in the discussions, so as to jointly discuss the organizational methods for the loan syndicate. (Guo Wen News Agency)</p>
<p>National Products Groups Petition for Implementation</p>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association, the Mechanized National Products Factories Association, the Shanghai National Products Factories Association, and the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products, etc., formed the National Products Grand Alliance Committee, and representative Gu Xiyuan went to the Central Bank at 11:00 AM yesterday to meet with Governor Kong Xiangxi. Secretary Tan Chonghuan met him on Kong's behalf. Gu requested that the 20 million yuan loan from the three banks to aid industry and commerce be implemented quickly. Tan replied that because the loan needed to be handled jointly with the Bankers Association, the procedures were slightly complicated.

<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation held its sixth executive committee meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included Hu Fengxiang, Shen Tianxin, Zhang Xianfang, Zhang Yichen, and Chen Jicheng. Shen Tianxin chaired, and Zhao Ziyun recorded. After the reports were given, they discussed the Ministry of Finance's order for the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank to jointly establish a mortgage-backed loan of 15 million yuan and a credit loan of 5 million yuan. They resolved to urge the quick implementation of these measures to alleviate the people's difficulties and appointed four committee members, Zhang Yichen, Hu Fengxiang, Shen Tianxin, and Zhang Xianfang, to separately visit Finance Minister Kong, Bank of China Chairman Song, and Bankers Association Chairman Chen to request immediate implementation.</p>
<p>Money Shops from Ningbo and Zhenhai Come to Settle Accounts</p>
<p>No fewer than seventy or eighty money shops in the Ningbo and Zhenhai areas have dealings with the money shops and industrial and commercial sectors of this city, with the Ningbo group being the most numerous. Every time the "Four Bottoms" and "Ten Bottoms" long-term settlement periods arrive, a large number of money shop representatives come to Shanghai to settle accounts. These representatives have now arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo and Zhenhai one after another. However, some are extending loans, while others are collecting debts, and not all are acting in unison. The actions of these money shop customers are also not carried out in groups, but rather individually or in small groups of two or three.</p>
<p>Increased Demand Causes Foreign Interbank Rate to Rise</p>
<p>The foreign interbank rate in the money market is gradually rising due to the "Four Bottoms" deadline. For example, it was 10% on the 25th of this month, 12% on the 26th, 15% on the 27th and 28th, and 18% yesterday (29th) both in the morning and afternoon. According to the money shop sector, this is a matter of supply and demand and is not a special phenomenon. Once the "Four Bottoms" deadline has passed, it should return to normal. In the future, when silk and tea are on the market and demand is even greater, a surprising peak in the foreign interbank rate will inevitably appear. (Above from Guo Wen News Agency)</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Lending is Extended, Equalization Tax Remains the Same</p>
<p>Following the continued rise in American silver prices, the Shanghai foreign exchange market has uniformly extended lending. Yesterday morning, the Central Bank announced today's (29th) telegraphic transfer selling prices as follows: London, one yuan in national currency equals one shilling and eight and a half pence; New York, one hundred yuan in national currency equals forty-one US dollars and twenty-five cents; Paris, one hundred yuan in national currency equals six hundred and twenty-two francs; Berlin, one hundred yuan in national currency equals one hundred and one and a half marks. As for the balancing tax rate announced by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee at 16:00 yesterday morning, it was calculated at 2 shillings and 1.125 pence, which is 6.75%, the same as in recent days.

<h3 id="e106">Ministry of Finance: Bans Money Shops from Halting Operations Under False Pretenses; Shareholders and Managers Should Be Held Responsible for Clearing Debts; Instructs the Money Shop Association to Investigate Halting Shops in Detail <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued an instruction to the Shanghai Money Shop Association yesterday, stating: "Since recent years, whenever there has been an emergency in the market, the Ministry has sent letters to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank to provide substantial loans to facilitate adjustments. Money shops, having received this assistance, should have developed their operations. However, recently there have still been cases of money shops going bankrupt or ceasing operations for liquidation. Upon closer inspection, the bankrupt and closed shops are not necessarily purely due to bad debts. There are often unscrupulous managers who abuse and embezzle funds or engage in corruption and fraud, using bankruptcy and closure as a means of concealing their crimes. Outsiders, unaware of the truth, often take the closure of money shops as a sign of financial distress, thereby shaking public confidence and affecting the market, which is deeply regrettable. The organizational structure of money shops is generally an unlimited company or partnership. Each shareholder or partner should bear unlimited liability for repayment. Managers and executives should also be held accountable. Money shops that go bankrupt or cease operations cannot evade responsibility until all debts are fully repaid by the managers and executives, along with the shareholders or partners, by simply entrusting a liquidator. Managers and executives who embezzle funds or engage in corruption and fraud should be severely punished according to the law and cannot be excused. Therefore, the association is instructed to promptly and thoroughly investigate the money shops that have recently gone bankrupt or ceased operations. If any of the above circumstances are found, the Ministry should be promptly informed with accurate facts so that legal action can be taken. All colleagues should be informed and must rectify their operations and not halt operations rashly, lest they cause disturbances. This is of utmost importance. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e108">Art Exhibition: Preview Day 21; Extended for Five Days at the Request of Various Sectors <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (29th) was the 21st day of the Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. The viewing was closed in the morning as usual, and reopened in the afternoon. The audience was extremely crowded, as the exhibition has been running for three weeks, and the number of viewers has been no less than tens of thousands. Everyone praised the preciousness of the antiquities, and the word spread, so more and more people have come to see them in recent days. The news obtained yesterday is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Extended for Five Days</p>
<p>The association's display of antiquities and public exhibition was originally scheduled to close today (30th), after which packing and shipping to England would take place. However, people from all walks of life believed that the exhibition of ancient artifacts and artworks from various dynasties in our country, held in Shanghai before going abroad, was for the appreciation and study of Chinese and foreign visitors. Given the size of Shanghai and the large population, this unprecedented exhibition was just when the people were paying attention. Closing it suddenly seemed too short a period. It was appropriate to extend the exhibition time and provide convenience for group visits to make it universal and increase people's understanding of their inherent culture, etc. In recent days, various groups have sent letters and telegrams with these reasons, requesting the association to extend the exhibition period. After several considerations, the association decided to extend the exhibition for five days, from May 1st to May 5th, after which no further extensions will be made. Groups that have sent letters requesting an extension, such as the China Art Education Society and the Hangzhou Youth Association, have been replied to individually, and the Shanghai Education Bureau has been notified that the preferential measures for schools and art academic groups will continue to be effective during the extended period. This is the last opportunity to view the association's display of antiquities, and people in Shanghai should not miss it.</p>
<p>Installation of Electric Fans</p>
<p>The number of people visiting the association's antiquities has been increasing every day. In order to improve public health and air circulation, the association has added electric fans to the exhibition hall. Therefore, the air inside the association venue has been very good lately.</p>
<p>Viewers' Notes</p>
<p>The exhibits at the London art exhibition preview are numerous and exquisite. Visitors truly have the impression of walking along the Shanyin Road, unable to take it all in. However, everyone's psychology is different, and the purpose of the visit is different, so what everyone pays attention to is also different. Even with regard to a certain exhibit, there are many different arguments. Those who study painting and calligraphy mostly stroll around the painting and calligraphy room. Those who study bronze and porcelain mostly linger in the bronze and porcelain room. The rest, those who study woodblock prints, those who are skilled in archaeology, and those who love to play with jade, all explore and study according to their preferences. Everyone has their own opinion, and it is not necessary to be the same in principle, nor is it possible to be the same in practice. Among them, the one that attracts the most attention is Qianlong's actual seat. This seat is rectangular, slightly like a sofa for two people, made of purple sandalwood inlaid with cloisonné, with extremely exquisite carvings and inlays, covered with a yellow dragon brocade cushion. Behind the seat is a screen, also made of purple sandalwood inlaid with cloisonné, with a landscape of mountains and pavilions. In front of the seat is a long sandalwood desk. This kind of table is very ordinary, but what is valuable is that the four sides and legs of the table are fully carved with inscriptions by famous people of the time, Liu Yong and Weng Fanggang, and paintings by Zheng Banqiao, Jin Nong, Jiang Nansha, Tang Tiufen, etc. It is said that this table was regarded as a historical treasure in the Qing Palace because of the above-mentioned famous carvings and because it was used by Qianlong. Later, the emperors of the Qing Dynasty did not easily use it. On the table are jade-handled brushes, brush rests, brush holders, ink beds, and water bowls, all made of mutton-fat jade, as well as jade seals, Duan inkstones, and imperial ink. It is said that these are all items used by Qianlong. The audience pays special attention to this and makes many comments. Some say that such a treasure seat and precious furnishings are truly solemn and brilliant, and one can imagine the dignity and wealth of the emperor. No wonder so many people want to be emperors. Some say that being an emperor is nothing more than this. Life is like acting, and the emperor is just a character on the stage. Still others say that the emperor has to sit on the real seat in a well-behaved and proper manner, with the left historian recording words and the right historian recording events, and everything that is said and done is recorded by someone, which is very restrictive. It is better to be a commoner like us and be free. Finally, a very funny lady said that if the association allowed visitors to sit on the real seat for one minute for one yuan, I would definitely spend one yuan to be a fake emperor for one minute. A female companion interjected and said, wouldn't that make you Wu Zetian? This made everyone laugh. Then the female companion said, Wu Zetian is indeed a heroine, and my words are not an insult. From these various conversations, I can see that everyone's psychology is very inconsistent. This treasure seat exhibition room can be used as a psychological testing room. The portraits of emperors in the painting and calligraphy exhibition room, such as the portrait of Emperor Taizu of Song, the portrait of Emperor Taizong of Song, and the portraits of emperors and empresses of the Yuan Dynasty, easily arouse the interest of the general audience, just like the aforementioned treasure seat. The portrait of Genghis Khan, a hero of the European nations, is even more noticeable to Chinese and foreigners for his heroic posture. Other works, such as the Red Hibiscus and White Goose Painting by Emperor Huizong of Song, the Long Scroll of Autumn Evening at the Pond, and the album pages written by him, Zhong Kui Painting by Emperor Shizu (Emperor Shunzhi) of Qing Dynasty, and Emperor Gaozong of Qing Dynasty (Emperor Qianlong)'s copy of Su Zizhan's book, the long scroll of Huang Zigiu's Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains, and the Yubo Fishing Boat Painting by Emperor Qianlong, Yuan Guan Daosheng (Zhao Ziang's wife)'s stone bamboo, Ming Xing Cijing (woman)'s painting of Buddha statue, etc., are all viewed by artists from the perspective of art itself, while ordinary viewers pay more attention to them because they are either works of emperors or works of famous ladies, and pay special attention to the identity of the author. They appreciate things beyond appearance. There were many visitors that day (29th), and the order was good, which shows that the national morality has greatly improved, which is very gratifying. In addition to visiting the art, I also got to observe the attitudes and psychology of various types of visitors, which was quite interesting. Although I dare not say that I understand the interesting things in the interesting, I can also be regarded as one who can get a taste of the taste outside the taste. Old Pen Notes.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Zeng Zhongming Discusses Railway Department's Construction of Various Lines <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Arrangements for the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways; Completion of the Huningyong Railway and Construction of the Sujia Railway</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago to negotiate with the financial community regarding the reorganization of the Railway Department's old debts. A Central News Agency reporter visited him at his private residence yesterday morning and inquired about the Railway Department's construction plans for various lines. Mr. Zeng provided detailed information, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiating the Reorganization of Old Debts</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng stated that his visit to Shanghai was to negotiate with the Shanghai financial community regarding the Railway Department's debts and to raise funds for new railway construction. He will remain in Shanghai for another day or two before returning to Nanjing. As for Gu Mengyu, the Minister of Railways, he has been on sick leave for several months. It is now learned that Mr. Gu's illness has subsided, and he will remain in Beiping for another month before returning south to temporarily reside in Lushan, as Mr. Gu's physical condition is inherently weak.</p>
<p>Remarkable Rise in Railway Stocks Overseas</p>
<p>A large number of railway stocks nationwide have been sold on overseas markets. In recent years, due to the development of various railway operations and improved credit, stock prices have been rising steadily. Currently, stock prices are three to four times, or even five to six times higher compared to three years ago. For example, stocks previously sold for £26 have now risen to £96, and stocks priced at £30 have risen to £101, and so on.</p>
<p>Plans for Reorganizing Two Railways</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng then discussed the plans for reorganizing the Pinghan and Yuehan railways. The reorganization of the Pinghan Railway is already underway. The Railway Department, considering the age of the Yellow River Railway Bridge, has consulted with railway experts and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to study solutions. They have determined that the river surface at that location is wider and the geological conditions are looser, making it necessary to select a new site for construction. The estimated cost is between 20 and 30 million yuan. As for the Yuehan Railway, construction is currently underway in sections and is expected to be open to traffic around December next year.</p>
<p>Completing the Huningyong Railway</p>
<p>The completion of the Huningyong Railway is also actively underway. The Qiantang River Railway Bridge is under construction by the Railway Department and the Zhejiang Construction Department and is expected to be completed next year. The second step will be the construction of the Cao'e River Railway Bridge. As for the extension of the Longhai Railway, the plan has also been decided, with the initial extension from Xi'an to Lanzhou. The Railway Department also plans to build the Su (Suzhou) Jia (Jiaxing) Railway as one of its new railway construction projects.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Overseas Chinese United Association Aids Overseas Chinese in Siam <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Adopting Boycott of Siamese Goods as a Passive Response</p>
<p>Sending Letters to Fujian and Guangdong Rice Merchants to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese United Association of this city, deeply angered by the recent harsh treatment of overseas Chinese by the Siamese government, has decided to assist the three million overseas Chinese in protecting their lives and property. In addition to convening a meeting of various sectors tomorrow to discuss response measures, the association sent letters to various chambers of commerce, rice merchant associations, and organizations in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Shantou, Shanghai, and other places yesterday, requesting unified assistance to achieve the goal of abolishing these harsh regulations as soon as possible. The original letter is reproduced below: To whom it may concern, according to the letters from the delegation of overseas Chinese petitioners in Siam, the Siamese government has promulgated compulsory education and immigration laws, as well as various regulations for the management of industry and commerce. On one hand, it is implementing its assimilation policy, and on the other hand, it is restricting our country's immigrants and destroying overseas Chinese industry and commerce. Its treachery and cruelty have reached their peak. If these policies are fully implemented, our three million overseas Chinese will become slaves of Siam. Currently, the industrial, commercial, and academic circles in Siam are extremely indignant at the Siamese government's absurd measures. Although representatives have been sent to the government to argue their case, the government has ignored them due to the lack of diplomatic relations between the two countries. As a last resort, representatives have been sent back to the country to petition the government and demand strict negotiations. However, this matter has a significant impact on the future of overseas Chinese and even the nation. We earnestly request your support so that we can draw the attention of both the authorities and the public to abolish these harsh regulations and establish friendly diplomatic relations between China and Siam. It is reported that there are tens of millions of overseas Chinese in our country, and the overseas Chinese in Siam account for one-third of them. Because there are no formal diplomatic relations between China and Siam, the Siamese government is allowed to destroy and oppress them and act arbitrarily. These new regulations are particularly fatal to overseas Chinese. If we sit idly by and do nothing, not only will three million overseas Chinese be reduced to foreigners, but other countries will also follow suit, and overseas Chinese will never be guaranteed peace and security, and our country will lose its dignity as an independent country. The Association, mindful of the past, is determined to do its best to assist the request made by the overseas Chinese representatives from Siam. However, this matter is of great importance. In order to gather ideas and benefit from collective wisdom, we are forwarding this matter to your association and ask for your cooperation and assistance and to propose response measures to awaken the public and promote strict government negotiations so as to achieve the goal.</p>

<p>Mr. Jinglun of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, in order to assist the refugee overseas Chinese who have been forced to return to China, has once requested instructions on solutions and inspected everything at the Qiaole Village. In addition to following the instructions of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing and introducing unemployed overseas Chinese to cultivate land in Qiaole Village in Anhui, he has also consulted with the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau of this city to discuss methods of assisting the refugee overseas Chinese. It is planned to temporarily establish a Relief Committee for Refugee Overseas Chinese Forced to Return to China. It is noted that the purpose of the bureau's establishment of the Relief Committee is based on the fact that the majority of refugee overseas Chinese who have been forced to return to China arrive at the border with nothing, have no place to stay, and are in a very pitiful situation. If they are not provided with assistance, they will inevitably go astray, which is not a blessing for the local community or the government's intention to care for overseas Chinese. The Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau of this city are also very concerned about this matter and have repeatedly sent personnel to discuss solutions with the overseas Chinese affairs authorities. It is learned that Director Jian of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau has decided to convene a joint meeting with the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau on May 4 to effectively implement the plan. The relief plan will be proposed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau for discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Kong Xiangrong Discusses; The Guantai Project is Extremely Consolidated; Yu Xuezhong Sends a Telegram of Gratitude <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Yellow River Guantai project has been completed, and the diversion of water has been successfully achieved. Director Kong Xiangrong came to Shanghai to report on the progress of the project. As reported in previous newspapers, a Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Kong yesterday morning to learn that the Engineering Relief Group paid unusual attention to the Guantai project. The east and west main dams, side dams, and earth retaining structures have all been built to the same height as the top of the dams. On the river side, in addition to willow and stone beds, stones have been thrown to form slopes. The earth embankments connecting the two dams have been heightened and thickened and have protective eaves. They are extremely consolidated. Furthermore, on the back river side of the joint, the east and west dams in Shandong have been rooted to build enclosures, which have been completed in three days and three nights. This is called a semi-dam in Western law, which balances the water level and uses the power of water to further consolidate the new blocking project. In addition, a levee of more than six li has been built near the Longmenkou, starting from the eastern dam, and protective eaves have been added, directly reaching the Huayang levee, connecting it as one to prevent changes in the water flow. At places where the tail of the eastern dam may have backflow erosion, and with a large number of existing materials, worth about 100,000, they are used for flood protection. It seems that such repair and prevention are both extremely thorough. It is the people's fortune. Furthermore, according to Director Kong, the large amount of stone materials used for this project was purchased by the Railway Bureau. Straw, willow branches, and blue bricks were purchased by various counties. Ships and vehicles were also hired by various counties, and the material prices and transportation costs were paid in cash without any delays. Lead wire and sack were either entrusted to the association or handled by the group, and all transactions were made in cash. The personnel handling the purchases and payments were all signed and sealed to clarify responsibilities. It has been reported that there have been delays in the payment of wages. This occurred during the Guantai project undertaken by the Hebei River Affairs Bureau before the group took over. When the group took over, it was announced that the various payments owed during Director Hua's tenure should be settled by himself. It has been reported to the association that this has nothing to do with the Engineering Relief Group. This is specifically stated to avoid misunderstandings. He also disclosed the telegram received by the Huangzai Association from Chairman Yu of Hebei yesterday. It can be seen that the group's handling of the project is extremely fast, and the payment of wages is especially clear, which is admirable and respectable. Attached is the telegram from Chairman Yu of Hebei. The Guantai blocking project has been successfully completed by the Engineering Relief Group of your association, and the water diversion has been achieved in time. This is a great achievement for the party and the country and a blessing for the people. I am extremely grateful. The purchase and transportation of materials and the collection of ships and vehicles by the government and counties are the responsibilities of local officials. I am even more awed by your praise. The flood season is approaching, and there are many things to be done to help the affected people. I am sincerely grateful. Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Silk Industry Association, in order to prepare for the maturity of the spring cocoons and to raise funds for purchasing and actively improving them, and to coordinate the development of overseas silk sales, held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Shanghai office in Zhulianli, Aven Road, at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss methods of collecting cocoons and making improvements.

After the ceremony, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that today's meeting is for private companies to elect six councilors to the Shipping Cooperative. This kind of organization is unprecedented in our country's shipping industry. Our country's shipping industry has historically been invaded by foreigners and has no room for development. Therefore, since the Ministry of Communications formulated the shipping cooperation plan, it has set up a preparatory office to proceed. Now that it is ready, it can be established the day after tomorrow (ie, tomorrow). From then on, our private shipping industry will work together with the state-owned sector in the spirit of coexistence and co-prosperity to promote Chinese shipping, eliminate competition, eliminate excess ships, and prevent the accumulation of goods. It will make a great contribution to the industrial, commercial, agricultural, and shipping industries. Then, Yang Youlong, director of the preparatory office, reported the preparation process.</p>
<p>Election Results Then the election began. The election was by signed ballot. As a result, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Bofen, Yang Guanbei, Lu Bohong, and Chen Ganqing received the most votes and were elected as the councilors of the private sector of the Shipping Cooperative.</p>
<p>Report to the Ministry of Communications The cooperative is scheduled to be formally established on May 1. The five councilors from the state-owned sector have reported to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The eleven councilors from the state-owned and private sectors should be reported to the Ministry of Communications for record, and the Ministry of Communications should be requested to send personnel to guide the founding meeting and supervise the swearing-in of the councilors and the election of standing councilors.</p>
<p>Shipping Line Distribution After the establishment of the cooperative, it will begin to organize joint business offices for the Yangtze River Line, the Coastal Line, and the Inner Harbor Line. The Yangtze River Line will be established first. Its ships will be allocated to shipping lines according to the company's usual routes and the suitability of the ships. The private companies currently belonging to the three shipping lines are the Yangtze River Line: Ningshao, Sanbei, Minsheng, Daxing; the Coastal Line: Zhengji, Beifang, Zhidong, Zhaoxing, Sanbei.

<h3 id="e122">The Brick and Ash Transportation Industry Periodically Levies an Aviation Patriotic Donation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Each Team Reports on the Enthusiastic Donation Results</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team Office of the China Aviation Association has passed a resolution to collect 20,000 yuan for aviation patriotic donations from brick and tile transportation industries. This resolution has been passed by the Executive Supervisory Committee of the Brick and Ash Industry Association. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the two industries held the first joint meeting at Tianchanlou on Xizang Road. The captain's office sent Zhang Yuliang to attend for guidance. Wu Mengsheng, Gu Jisheng, and Xue Jizhou of the brick and ash industry, and Sun Jinquan, Yang Hanzhang, Jia Zhican, Cao Guobing. Zhu Yuanji of the transportation tile industry etc. Chairman Gu Jisheng, recorded Zhou Baiqi, immediately resolved: (1) The name was set as the Shanghai Brick and Ash Industry Transportation Brick and Tile Industry Aviation Patriotic Donation Committee. (2) It was decided to start collecting on May 16. (3) A notice was issued in the name of the committee to all tea houses and all transport tile industries in the city, requiring them to register with the committee within one week. Those who fail to register within the time limit will be submitted to the China Aviation Association's Shanghai Solicitation Team Office for disposal. (4) The Brick and Ash Industry Association will notify all members in the city to collect donations on a regular basis. (5) Wu Mengsheng, Gu Jisheng, Sun Jinquan, Xue Jizhou, and Cheng Zhaowen were appointed as standing committee members to handle daily affairs. (6) It was decided to hold the second joint meeting on May 10 to determine the direction of progress. It can be seen that the two industries are enthusiastically supporting the aviation patriotic movement. I deeply hope that other industries will hear the news and work together for the national salvation cause. The leader of the 343 team, Ji Wu, is the principal of the Youth Middle School. He is working very hard to solicit donations. The school has about two or three hundred students. In the student aspect, more than 500 yuan has been raised. He has also hired a deputy captain to solicit donations. He also notified the family members of the students to give their full support. In addition, the deputy captain of the 242 team, Tang Zhenxian, reported that he has achieved more than 300 yuan. The deputy captain of the 75 team, Gao Tianqi, has raised 200 yuan. It can be seen that each team is working hard to carry out the solicitation work in general. Gu Zhuxuan, the captain of the 298 team, is always enthusiastic about social undertakings. He is particularly committed to supporting the aviation patriotic movement. He specially donated 500 yuan yesterday, which was submitted to the captain's office by Zhao Chasheng. It is reported that Captain Gu will continue to use other methods to carry out the solicitation.</p>

<h3 id="e124">What Was Heard About the Opening of the Shanghai-Xiang Intercity Train on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Xiang double track built by the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway has long been completed. However, due to the fact that various facilities such as signals are still being prepared, it is currently not possible to officially use it as a double track. The railway plans to temporarily use the newly added track from May 1 to test the opening of the Shanghai-Xiang intercity passenger train by steam locomotive, and added stops at Zhongshan Road and Jiangqiao Station. It was reported in the previous newspaper that the intercity train runs 12 times a day in each direction. In Shanghai, the first train departs at 5:10 a.m. After that, the train departs once every one hour and thirty minutes for the next three times. For the fifth and sixth times, the departure time is one hour and twenty-five minutes after the last departure. For the seventh to ninth times, the departure time is one hour and forty minutes after the last departure. For the tenth to twelfth times, the departure time is one hour and thirty minutes after the last departure. Therefore, people coming from Nanxiang can take the train back to Xiang at 10:00 p.m. In Nanxiang, the first train departs at 5:50 a.m. and the last one at 10:40 p.m. From now on, it is very convenient to travel between Shanghai and Xiang. The monthly ticket price is particularly low, regardless of grade. Except for Jiangqiao and Nanxiang, where the fare is one cent, each other station is only five cents. The fare for the entire distance between Shanghai and Nanxiang is only 25 cents. The ticket sales and boarding and alighting place in Shanghai is at the north end of Zaoqiao. However, passengers are not allowed to carry heavy luggage except for light items carried with them. (If there is heavy luggage, you can take other ordinary trains at Shangbei Main Station). Also, Shanghai-Xiang intercity trains do not issue through tickets. However, round-trip tickets and periodical tickets, i.e., monthly tickets, are all accepted.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Silk Industry Bank Promotes Acceptance Drafts <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Besides accepting discounting, it can also be used as collateral, facilitating commercial transactions and creating a new chapter.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association and the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank have vigorously promoted commercial acceptance drafts, all parties have agreed. As for the discounting aspect, it has also been resolved by the Bankers Association of Shanghai, and all banks in the association will handle it without any problems. As for the discounting procedures, in order to unify the banks, a sub-committee has been organized to discuss and formulate various documents. The Central Bank has also promised rediscounting. Various industries, such as electrical machinery silk weaving factories, equipment dyeing and weaving industries, cotton cloth industry, and egg industry, have all agreed to implement it. In terms of promotion, it can be said that it is gradually becoming concrete. It is learned that the Silk Industry Bank, which has been the most vigorous in promoting this type of draft, has accepted many discounting cases in recent days. The discount rate is very low, intending to make it gradually popular through promotion. The bank is also concerned that various industries may not be very clear about the style of acceptance drafts and discounting procedures, so it has printed a whole book of drafts for purchase by all sectors, and also printed "Discounting Guidelines" for free collection. Recently, in view of the needs of commercial transactions, it has newly created commercial deposits, which can entrust the bank to collect commercial acceptance drafts on its behalf. If the bank agrees, it can also be used as collateral. The bank's discounting guidelines and commercial deposit regulations are excerpted and attached below:</p>
<p>Discounting Guidelines</p>
<p>Discounting Guidelines for Commercial Acceptance Drafts: (1) Any merchant or manufacturer who holds an acceptance draft and intends to discount it at this bank should first fill out an application form. (2) If the bank considers it qualified, it will immediately notify the applicant to go through the discounting procedures. (3) The number of days for discounting bills shall not exceed a certain number of days at most. (4) The discount rate and the discount amount shall be negotiated by the applicant and the bank at any time. (5) The discounted bill shall be endorsed by the discounter and transferred to the bank. (6) The stamp duty to be affixed on the discounted bill shall be handled by the discounter. (7) If the bill is not paid upon maturity, the bank may exercise the right of recourse against any one of the drawer, endorser, and guarantor. (8) After the bill is paid upon maturity, the bank will immediately return the bill to the payer.</p>
<p>Deposit Regulations</p>
<p>(1) Any company or firm that opens a business in this city can apply to the bank to open an account with an initial deposit of one hundred yuan. Upon the bank's approval, a check will be issued for withdrawal. (2) The monthly interest rate is three percent. If the daily balance is above 500 yuan, an additional half percent will be given. If the daily balance is above 1,000 yuan, an additional one percent will be given. Compound interest will be calculated monthly and a statement will be sent. (3) If the bank is entrusted to collect commercial acceptance drafts, no handling fee will be charged. If the bank agrees, it can also be used as collateral.</p>

<p>Products that have passed the sanitation bureau's chemical tests are submitted to the two county governments for review.</p>
<p>The Candy Industry Association reported that many candy factories have reported to the association that it has been reported in recent days that peddlers selling candy in various villages and towns within the borders of the two counties of Chuansha and Baoshan have been using candy containing toxic substances to lure children. Many of those who eat it are poisoned to death. The rumor has spread and everyone is talking about it. The local public security bureau is strictly cracking down on it. The wind is blowing fiercely, and even shops selling candy are searched. Therefore, customers in the area have returned their goods one after another, fearing that the entire candy industry will be hit. The association believes that this matter is of great importance. Yesterday afternoon, it convened a meeting of candy group members to discuss protection measures. More than 20 candy factory representatives attended. As a result of the discussion, it was requested that the county governments of Chuansha and Baoshan order their respective public security bureaus to review the peddlers selling candy when cracking down on them, and also request that they not involve stores. A list of candy factories was attached to the presentation to assist in the investigation. It is learned that most of the candy factories in this city are members of the association, and all products have been sampled and tested by the Municipal Health Bureau and found to be qualified.</p>

<h3 id="e130">American Warship Collides with Pig Boat <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Sun Qiugen Drowns in the Huangpu River, All Pigs on Board Disappear</p>
<p>Wang Asan from Nanhui, along with his friends Cao Lansheng and Tao Langqing, recently collected 62 pigs raised by villagers in the Chenjiaqiao area of Pudong. 41 pigs were under the name of Wang Asan, 13 pigs were under the name of Cao Lansheng, and 8 pigs were under the name of Tao Langqing. They hired Sun Qiugen (26 years old, from Nanhui)'s barge to load them and planned to transport them to Jiangwan Town for delivery. At 4:18 am the day before yesterday (the 27th), Sun Qiugen's pig boat was sailing in the Huangpu River near Gaoqiao. The American warship "Finchi" (transliteration) was sailing into the port. The two ships were close together. Sun Qiugen saw it and wanted to avoid it, but the current was too fast and it was too late. At that time, the sky was not yet bright, and there was a drizzle and heavy fog. The warship was sailing extremely fast. In an instant, a tragedy occurred. The bow of the warship crashed into the stern of Sun Qiugen's boat. With a loud bang, Sun's boat was immediately shattered and capsized. Everyone on board fell into the water. Except for Wang Asan, Cao Lansheng, Tao Langqing, etc., who were rescued and survived, Sun Qiugen had already joined the wave god. All 62 pigs on board fell into the Huangpu River and disappeared. Afterwards, Wang Asan and others reported to the water patrol police station, requesting to salvage Sun Qiugen's body and demanding compensation for the damage from the warship. Yesterday morning, the salvage bureau's patrol boat salvaged Sun Qiugen's body in the Huangpu River south of Gaoqiao and brought it to Nantou Wharf for examination. A detective named Liang Shenqing was dispatched by the police chief to summon the deceased's wife, Sun Gu, and Wang Asan, Cao Lansheng, etc., to prepare a letter to be transferred to the local court. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Dian Binzhang conducted an interrogation and then led investigator Xuan Zhiming to the scene. After examining Sun Qiugen's body, it was confirmed that he had drowned.

<p>More Internal and External Guards Suspected, Jailbreak Inmate Demonstrates Jailbreak Truth</p>
<p>Murderer Chen Jinlan escaped from the Special Second District Court detention center on the morning of December 27 last year. The warden immediately transferred the guards of the upper and lower three shifts to the prosecutor's office. As a result of the investigation, it was found that the internal guard of the three to seven shifts, Fang Yuqi, and the external guard, Zhou Wenjin, were suspected of facilitating the escape. They were prosecuted and sentenced to imprisonment. The police station arrested Chen and sent him to the court. The prosecutor interrogated him and filed a public prosecution. The current acting warden, Sun Xiong, according to the escape time provided by Chen, transferred the internal guard Yang Xingcun and the external guard Yan Ling to the prosecutor's office. The Wang prosecutor opened a court hearing to investigate the situation the day before yesterday, which has been reported in the newspaper. It is learned that in order to clarify the detailed process of Chen's escape, the Wang prosecutor dispatched police officers to the police station at 3 pm yesterday to transfer Chen to the case and bring him to the detention center. A small section of fine lead wire was given to Chen to make a key on the spot and demonstrate the process of unlocking and escaping. Then, a court hearing was opened to interrogate Chen and Yang and Yan for a long time. An order was issued to return them to the detention center to await further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Lu Shaotang Flees, Huafeng Case Adjourned <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Xu Guannan is not a Huafeng shareholder and requests not to be liable for debt.</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang and others jointly opened the Huafeng Xingji Flour Company in 1929. In recent years, the business has declined, losses have accumulated, and it has been unable to maintain it, so it has closed down. The debts owed, just to the Qianye (money shops), have reached more than 277,200 yuan. The Da De and other 27 Qian Zhuang (money shops) have jointly filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against the shareholders of the factory, Lu Shaotang, Ye Shantao, Xu Guannan, etc. It has been reported in the previous newspapers. It is learned that after Xu Guannan received the court summons, he hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to submit a statement stating that he had withdrawn his shares and should no longer be liable for debt. According to his statement, when the factory was organized, Lu Shaotang attached 50% of the shares, and he and Ye Shantao each attached 25% of the shares. Later, because he was getting older and weaker, he did not intend to partner, and formally withdrew his shares in June 1931. At that time, Hua Fu was still self-sufficient, so more than 34,560 taels of capital silver were returned when he withdrew his shares. The money pursued by the original plaintiffs are all debts after he withdrew his shares, so there is no need to be jointly responsible. It is requested that the part of the lawsuit against him be dismissed. The case was heard again by Judge Peng the day before yesterday, but Lu Shaotang, who is actually responsible for Huafeng, has recently fled due to other cases, so it is still impossible to summon him. The court then ordered the hearing to be adjourned.</p>

<p>The home of Mrs. Tang Xu, a Ningbo woman, at No. 38, Lane 609, East Xihua Road, was invaded by four armed bandits at about 8 pm on March 9 this year. They took out their sleeves and intimidated the family, robbing them of more than 130 yuan worth of clothing and silver. They fled in separate directions. Before leaving, they tied the front and back doors with tangled silk threads to prevent them from going out to report to the police. After the neighbors removed the lead wire, Mrs. Tang reported the situation to the Yulin Road police station in charge, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest the bandits without success. The day before yesterday, Chinese detective Zhao Ziren learned that Li Siyuan, a Ningbo thief involved in the case, was hiding at No. 18, Xinhua Lane, Pingji Road. He reported to the police chief and went to the address with a Western detective to arrest him and bring him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Li Zhishan, stated the previous situation and said that the victim had not yet been summoned, and requested that the detention be postponed. Based on the report of the Chinese and Western detectives on the arrest of the defendant, the interrogation of Li Thief, who denied the charges, Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody and the matter to be investigated and verified at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Public Works Bureau Discusses the Organization of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>In August last year, the Public Works Bureau drafted a plan for the organization of the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association, which could be reconsidered after eight months. Recently, at the request of the rickshaw owners' association, a meeting was convened at the Public Works Bureau yesterday morning (the 29th). Five people, including Mr. Yin Zhiling, attended on behalf of the rickshaw owners. The Public Works Bureau was chaired by Director-General Faithunton. Attendees included the deputy director and three members of the rickshaw committee. The rickshaw owners' side made a statement regarding the monthly collection of 1.5 yuan for the mutual aid association fee. The chairman stated that this issue was not on the agenda for discussion, as the Public Works Bureau's established policy was that rickshaw owners must cooperate with the mutual aid association in order to be granted a rickshaw license. The organization issue was then discussed. The rickshaw owners' representatives proposed sending people to join the fund committee. The chairman of the rickshaw committee replied that this was not appropriate, as the fund committee members must be very enthusiastic about seeking welfare for the rickshaw pullers. If the rickshaw owners' association joins, it will inevitably cause obstacles. Moreover, the rickshaw owners already have two representatives in the board of directors. If the fund committee members do not act in accordance with the board of directors' policy, the board of directors can appeal to the Public Works Bureau. The rickshaw owners' representatives then proposed adjourning the meeting in order to discuss it with the executive committee of the association. The chairman of the rickshaw committee then asked whether the association was willing to continue to collect the rickshaw licenses for the next month according to the current method (that is, the 1.5 yuan fee will still be collected). The association representatives said that if there is no other agreement within the day, the rickshaw owners will continue to handle it as before in May. The meeting was then adjourned and will be continued after the rickshaw owners' side has reached a decision.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Record of the Shangchuan Company Shareholders' General Meeting <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>It was decided to extend the road line to Nanhui and add 600,000 preferred shares.</p>
<p>Shangchuan Transportation Company has been operating the long-distance tramcar business from Shanghai to Chuansha. The business has been developing well and the results have been remarkable in recent years. On the 28th of this month, the 11th Shareholders' General Meeting was held at the company's office in Qingning Temple to discuss important matters such as extending the Nanchuan Road line and increasing capital. By 1 pm, a total of 230 shareholders were present, with more than 11,000 shares, and the number of shareholders and shares both exceeded half. The meeting was convened immediately, and Chairman Qu Shaoyi was elected as the chairman. First, Manager Gu Baowei reported on the progress and business conditions of the past year, stating that the Nanchuan Road line has been urged by local people. After the board of directors was entrusted with the decision made at last year's shareholders' general meeting, the Nanchuan and Chuanqin road line contracts were signed with the Nanhui and Chuansha county governments respectively in May last year, and they were submitted to the provincial authorities for approval. The Chuanqin line, from Sizao Port outside the North Gate of Chuansha to the Nanhui border of Xiaoyingfang, has been paved and opened to traffic. The Nanchuan line has also been surveyed and mapped, and construction will begin soon. The operating income for the past year was 227,000 yuan. After deducting expenses and setting aside public reserves and depreciation, the net profit was more than 44,000 yuan. Next, Supervisor Lu Wenmei reported on the accounting. The shareholders approved it on the spot, and then discussed the proposals. 1. The dividend distribution proposal was decided to be distributed at the official rate of 1%, with more than 4,000 yuan remaining to be added to the public reserves. 2. The company's capital is 400,000 yuan. After experts estimated that the current fixed assets are worth more than 630,000 yuan, the original value of the company's assets since its establishment has been more than 900,000 yuan. After depreciation and reserves and preparation funds, the net profit is more than 100,000 yuan. Now, because of the extension of the road line, it is necessary to add capital. How should this surplus be handled? It was decided to distribute 100,000 yuan to the shareholders as new shares, and the directors and supervisors stated that in addition to the dividend for this year to ordinary shareholders, all directors and supervisors would use the dividends they should receive as new shares. 3. The extension of the Nanchuan Road line requires amending the articles of association and increasing capital. First, the chairman explained that extending the road line to Nanhui would cost more than 600,000 yuan. After detailed discussions among the shareholders, it was decided to continue to solicit 30,000 preferred shares, totaling 600,000 yuan. The preferred shares have the benefit of preferential distribution of official interest and preferential repayment of capital within six years. In addition to the previous surplus of 100,000 yuan, which is distributed to old shareholders according to the original share amount, there are still 25,000 shares. According to the regulations, old shareholders have the right to subscribe for shares first. However, there are many requests from all parties to subscribe for shares. For the sake of universality, 15,000 shares are specially made available for subscription by people other than old shareholders and in the area where the road line is extended. Next, supervisors were elected. As a result, Wei Yuping, Lu Wenmei, and Cai Guocai were elected with the most votes. The meeting ended at 6 pm. It is heard that the company's approach to doing things has always been steady and pragmatic, striving for truth from facts everywhere and striving to save on expenses. Therefore, although the recent recession has spread across the country, the company's business has been increasing year by year, making it rare for shareholders to still have 1% of the official interest. The experts who were hired to estimate the fixed assets of the accounting company were Mr. Li Qianruo, the dean of the School of Engineering of Jiaotong University, Mr. Wang Shengsan, the vice president of the Chinese Society of Civil Engineers and the director of the Investigation Section of the Four Banks Savings Association, and Mr. Shi Zhiren, the deputy director of the Machinery Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. They are all well-known engineering and mechanical experts. After on-site detailed estimation, they issued a certificate and were responsible for proving it. The company currently extends to Xiaoyingfang in Chuansha, which is only more than 40 li long. If it is extended to Datuan in Nanhui, it will increase by more than 50 li, so that people from Nanhui can reach Shanghai in less than four hours. Not only will it facilitate local transportation, but it can also be predicted that the business will be even more developed.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Thugs Make Strong Threats and Intimidate Securities Firm Owner: <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Demand Reduced from 20,000 to 15,000 Yuan. Detective Intervenes to Negotiate and Arrest a Thug.</p>
<p>Wei Chao Geng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 12 Shangwen Lane, Weihaiwei Road, operates the Dayuan Securities Firm at No. 11 Meiren Lane, Hankou Road. Since March 31st of this year, Wei and his Ningbo hometown have received five threatening letters from a gang identifying themselves as the "Guoye Zongshe," alleging that Wei inherited hundreds of thousands of yuan from his father's estate and requesting a contribution of 20,000 yuan to their operating expenses. The letters used strong and intimidating language. Wei ignored the letters. However, in the past two days, Wei's relative, He Wenhua (accountant at the Dazhongyang Shoes Factory, No. 241 Ningguo Road), also received two threatening letters from the same organization, asking him to forward them. The amount requested had been reduced from 20,000 to 15,000 yuan, and they arranged to meet at the roof garden entrance of the Sincere Company between 8:00 and 9:00 PM the night before. The person was instructed to hold a newspaper in one hand and carry a Madunhe hatbox in the other as a sign. Someone would approach them for negotiations, but they were strictly forbidden from bringing many followers. Failure to comply would result in "appropriate measures." Wei sent He Wenhua as his representative and reported the matter to the Chengdu Road Police Station at 6:30 AM the previous morning. Detective Xie Guisheng, Western Detective Harvard, and others were dispatched to keep watch. He Wenhua followed the instructions in the letter and arrived at the Sincere Company's main entrance, carrying a newspaper and hatbox. Soon after, Zhu Zhongwu, a Shaoxing native, approached He and confirmed that he was Wei's representative. They went up to the roof garden to have tea and discuss the matter. He stated that Wei did not have such a large sum of money and could only borrow ten or twenty yuan, or perhaps pay according to his means, but the difference in amount was too great to negotiate. He then removed his hat as prearranged, and the Chinese and Western detectives rushed in and arrested Zhu, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, charged him under Article 370 of the Criminal Code and stated that the case required further investigation of accomplices and verification of handwriting, requesting a postponement. Judge Yang Zhaoqi reviewed the confession and ordered Zhu to be remanded in custody, with the hearing postponed to next Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e145">French Police in Concession Arbitrarily Interfere with Store's Gong and Drum Music; Second Special District Fourth Branch Sends Letter to French Police Requesting Rectification <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Union, located near the Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, was holding a 15th-anniversary celebration for its member Gao Maoshengtang Chinese Medicine Store at Nos. 154 and 156 Rue Lafayette. A number of gong and drum players were hired to perform at the store to mark the occasion. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the 27th of this month, French Police Officer No. 96 and Chinese Police Officer No. 177 arrived to stop the performance and recorded the store's address to impose an arbitrary fine, leading the union to request intervention. After learning the details, the union sent a letter to the French Superintendent yesterday requesting a rectification. The original letter is transcribed below: To the esteemed Superintendent: According to a letter from Gao Maoshengtang Chinese Medicine Store, a member of this union located at Nos. 154 and 156 Rue Lafayette, the store is currently holding its 15th-anniversary celebration, offering special deals for one month, and has hired a number of gong and drum players to perform at the store to mark the occasion. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the 27th of this month, while the performers were playing at the store, French Police Officer No. 96 and Chinese Police Officer No. 177 arrived to stop the performance and asked if they had obtained a permit. The store immediately stated that they had never obtained a permit for anniversary celebrations and that there was no reason to pay a permit fee for performing inside the store. Despite their explanation, the Western police officer was unreasonable and ordered the performance to stop, also recording the store's address to impose a fine. The store's special anniversary sale does not violate any police regulations, and the Western police officer abused his authority by unreasonably obstructing business, making it difficult for merchants to operate. They immediately reported the matter to the responsible police station, which replied that a fine of two yuan was to be paid. However, they did not allow the store to explain the situation. It is clear that the police officer unreasonably interfered with the gong and drum music and is now falsely claiming it was a street obstruction, arbitrarily imposing a fine. Such unreasonable punishment is unacceptable, and we hereby request that your esteemed office intervene based on reason to ensure business is conducted peacefully. According to this, we have found that police officers have recently been creating unnecessary trouble by arbitrarily fining shops when recording their addresses. This has been happening daily, and this union has received reports from members repeatedly. In this case, the Western police officer's unreasonable harassment of merchants is particularly obvious. We respectfully request that your esteemed Superintendent investigate and correct this matter promptly.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Retired Military Officer Sued by Maid: <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Accused of Abandonment after Seduction and Stealing the Child; Lawsuit Seeks Alimony and Education Expenses</p>
<p>Deng Jianhao, a Hubei native and former military officer residing in a Western-style house at No. 589 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, had several concubines during his tenure as a division commander before 1930. Having already one wife and three concubines, he spent 5,000 yuan to take Mei Ying, a Haiment woman, as his fourth concubine, introduced by his servant Liu Xiangtai, who was from Haimen. Liu also arranged for his fellow villager, Cheng Di, whom he had previously purchased and adopted as a goddaughter, to serve as Mei Ying's dowry maid. In 1930, Deng was ordered to lead his troops to Jiangxi to suppress bandits, but unfortunately, he failed and was dismissed by his superiors, placed under supervision, and then sent to the Lu Army Prison in Nanjing to await investigation. At that time, Mei Ying also lived in Nanjing and often had Cheng Di visit the prison to deliver clothes and other items.</p>
<p>He Bribed Guards and Forcibly Defiled Her.</p>
<p>However, Deng saw that Cheng Di was young and beautiful, and he harbored improper thoughts. He bribed the prison guards and, when Cheng Di came to visit the prison, he forcibly defiled her in the reception room. Afterward, he promised her that after his release, he would take her as a concubine and told her to wait patiently. Soon after, Deng was released with the help of an important figure. However, after Deng was released, he broke his promise to Cheng Di. Cheng Di felt wronged and recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Deng Jianhao of abduction and rape, malicious abandonment, and Liu Xiangtai of abduction.</p>
<p>Interfering with a Family, and restricting her freedom.</p>
<p>Interfering with a family, interfering with freedom, and enslavement. She also filed a civil suit seeking alimony, the return of her child, and educational expenses, totaling 41,280 yuan. Her statement of claim states that the plaintiff lost her mother at a young age and was orphaned. She met Liu Xiangtai, the second defendant, a fellow villager, who tricked her into becoming his adopted daughter. In 1929, Liu Xiangtai sold another woman named Mei Ying to Deng Jianhao, the first defendant, as his fourth concubine for 5,000 yuan, and ordered the plaintiff to go with her as a maid. In 1930, the first defendant was accused of greed and illegal activities while suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and was detained in the Nanjing Lu Army Prison, in a solitary cell. The plaintiff, on Mei Ying's orders, often went to deliver items. Unexpectedly, the first defendant dared to</p>
<p>Bribe the Guards</p>
<p>to rape a girl under the age of sixteen and forbid her from speaking out. After his release, he made sweet promises, saying he would take her as a concubine in the future, while secretly monitoring her and preventing her from going out. The plaintiff, under his control, had no choice but to submit to his abuse. In December 1933, the plaintiff became pregnant. In May of the following year, she was heavily pregnant. At that time, the first defendant and his fourth concubine, Mei Ying, agreed that it was inconvenient to give birth at home and insisted that she return to her hometown of Haimen to await delivery, promising to come and pick her up after the birth. On October 16th of the following year, she</p>
<p>Gave Birth to a Son</p>
<p>At Chenshi, on the 26th, Deng's fourth concubine, Mei Ying, returned to Haimen and carried the child away. Because the child was not yet a month old, she was not allowed to take him. Later, Deng personally</p>
<p>Sent a Letter to Mei Ying</p>
<p>which contained the words, "Do as I say, no matter what, first bring the child back." The original letter is still in existence. On November 19th of the same year, Deng sent someone to Haimen again to forcibly take the child away, disregarding the plaintiff's life or death. Although she repeatedly sent letters requesting living expenses, the first defendant initially ignored them and then returned the original letters. Since then, there has been no news and no communication. The plaintiff claims that the first defendant was greedy and unlawful in office, and promiscuous in private. He raped a minor virgin and forcibly took away the child. Not only is the infant child separated from his mother, endangering his life, but his abandonment after seduction is</p>
<p>Inhumane and Cruel</p>
<p>beyond measure. His actions violate Article 240, Paragraph 1, and Article 309, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code, and the second defendant violates Article 257, Paragraph 1, and Article 313, Paragraph 1, of the same code. She is therefore filing a self-accusation and also a civil suit, requesting that the first defendant pay the plaintiff alimony of 50 yuan per month from the age of 21 to 60, totaling 24,000 yuan, and return the child, as well as pay for the child's educational expenses, averaging 60 yuan per month, up to 1935, totaling 17,280 yuan, for a total of 41,280 yuan, etc. When the court dispatched bailiffs to serve the summons at the defendant's residence, the family replied that the defendant</p>
<p>Had Gone to Hankou</p>
<p>and no one accepted the summons. Therefore, at the court hearing on the 9th of this month, the defendants failed to appear. The plaintiff's lawyer requested a warrant to be issued, which the plaintiff would serve. The court approved the request and scheduled a new hearing. Judge Zhang Chaozuo issued a summons and dispatched bailiffs to serve the summons at the defendant's address, but the defendant had moved away with his entire family and no one accepted the summons. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang held a hearing, but both defendants</p>
<p>Still Absent,</p>
<p>Only the plaintiff and her lawyer appeared in court. After the court inquired about the circumstances of the summons, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant was still in Shanghai, residing on Beile Road, and requested that an arrest warrant be issued under Article 50 of the Criminal Procedure Law, as the defendant was at risk of fleeing. The court said that an arrest warrant is not a search warrant, and it's not okay to go to people's homes to search. Now that the defendant has failed to appear twice, the court can only suspend the trial proceedings. In the future, there will be a ruling served, and after the plaintiff receives the ruling, she will know where the defendant is. She can then take the ruling to report to the police station and have them arrest him, or notify the court to bring him in for trial. There's no need to issue an arrest warrant to be served. After the argument, the court declared adjournment.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Changye Real Estate Company Sues Lu Xihou for Repayment of Mortgage Loan <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Verdict to be Announced on May 6th</p>
<p>All real estate of Guomin Hotel Nos. 26 and 28 at the intersection of Tianzhutang Street and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession belongs to Lu Xihou, the chairman of the bankrupt China Xingye Bank. Lu mortgaged this real estate to the British-owned Changye Real Estate Company for 250,000 taels of silver, equivalent to 349,650.35 yuan, with interest calculated at 8% per month. After the collapse of China Xingye Bank last year, the First Special District Court entrusted the Second Special District Court to attach this real estate. Now, the creditor Changye Real Estate Company, managed by a Westerner named Moore (transliteration), hired lawyer Chen Zhongyin to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Lu, seeking repayment of the loan and interest from last October until the end of the execution. The court accepted the case and yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu held a hearing in the Seventh Civil Court. Both plaintiffs and defendants, each accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. The plaintiff first stated the facts of the lawsuit and the object of the judgment. Then, the defendant Lu Xihou was questioned, and he admitted the mortgage and said he would find a way to repay it to redeem the property. He said that the litigation costs were huge and he could not afford them, requesting that the plaintiff be ordered to assume them. As for the interest, he would pay it up to December 18th of last year, but after that, due to the collapse of China Xingye Bank, he was placed under court custody and stopped paying interest. After the arguments of both lawyers, the court declared the hearing concluded and scheduled the verdict to be announced on May 6th.</p>

<p>Song Baoxian is Extremely Villainous</p>
<p>Chen Adong, a 22-year-old from Wuxing, recently came to Shanghai to negotiate a mountain goods business at the Xie Feng Tai Chang cargo companies in the Sixteenth Section. At 10:40 PM the night before, he was watching a play at the Fuan Amusement Park on Dongmen Road. Song Baoxian, a Tongzhou native and groom sitting next to him (22 years old, at the Chuanda Horse Carriage Company at No. 132 Zhaojiabang Road), accused Chen Adong of being a pickpocket and stealing his wallet, which contained 15 yuan in cash. As a result, Officer Zhao Ziling took them to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. Chief Liu questioned the plaintiff, Song Baoxian, who alleged that Chen had pickpocketed his wallet while watching the play, which contained 15 yuan in cash. When asked where the money came from, he claimed that he had collected it from the Ruidun Wireless Company in Xiaodongmen. Chen Adong stated that he had just come to Shanghai from Wuxing to negotiate business, and the Xie Feng Tai Chang cargo companies certified that he was a legitimate businessman. Chief Liu immediately investigated and found that there was no Ruidun Wireless Company in Xiaodongmen, and the Chuanda Horse Carriage Company had not authorized Song to collect accounts, proving that Song Baoxian was trying to swindle the villager Chen with false accusations. Therefore, the plaintiff became the defendant and was sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>I. A Glimmer of Economic Improvement in China</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, China's economy is suffering from the pressure of foreign inflation and the impact of controlled economies, resulting in massive trade deficits and silver outflows, creating a declining economic picture. However, in the past year, public and private economic enterprises have shown signs of improvement in their efforts to cope with this environment through defense and adjustment, as well as internal development. A few key points are outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Matters Related to Finance and Construction: (A) Public bonds and treasury bills that have been consolidated are being repaid on schedule with both principal and interest. Bonds issued this year, including foreign currency bonds and those issued by various provinces, total approximately 220 million yuan. Local bonds are mainly focused on construction and disaster relief. (B) National taxes have been consolidated, and customs and salt taxes have been revised. Over 3,600 kinds of arbitrary taxes and levies have been abolished. (C) Important construction projects, such as the diversion of the Huai River, the control of the Yellow River, the diversion of the Wei River, the port development of Pukou, and the Qiantang River Bridge, have either been completed or are under construction. Factories for manufacturing machine alcohol, ammonium sulfate, etc., are being established one after another. Steel and newspaper factories are also in the planning stages. These efforts are aimed at strengthening the foundations of both public and private economies.</p>
<p>(2) Matters Related to Currency and Exchange Rates: (A) Currency Consolidation: The Ministry of Finance has issued a ban on private currencies and banknotes. (B) Exchange Rate Management: Measures include the implementation of silver export duties and equalization taxes, as well as the successive establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Currency System Committee. In addition, speculative bidding has been prohibited, and the Central Bank is now responsible for setting the daily exchange rate. Although the effects are not yet significant, the unification of currency and the management of exchange rates have at least begun.</p>
<p>(3) Matters Related to Transportation: (A) Railway Projects: Major projects include the extension of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to Nanchang, the extension of the Longhai Railway to Xi'an, the connection of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the construction of the Huainan Railway to Hefei, and the construction of the Jingzhao section of the Beijing-Wuhu Railway. These projects are actively underway and will connect urban and inland areas, facilitating the transportation of goods. (B) Highway Projects: The Seven-Province Interconnection Highway, with a total length of over 22,000 kilometers, has 3,290 kilometers already open to traffic (according to the Economic Commission Highway Administration's December report). The highways in the three northwestern provinces, Gansu and Qinghai, total over 10,000 li. In Ningxia, highways extend south to Guyuan and north to Linhe, and are either completed or under construction. In addition, provinces such as Hebei and Fujian are building their own highways, which, according to surveys, total over 30,000 kilometers, further facilitating inland transportation and the marketing of local products. (Improvements in telephone services are omitted here for brevity.) (C) Improved Transportation Services: Joint freight transport on railways such as the Beijing-Shanghai, Pingpu, and Longhai lines has been implemented, and responsible transportation is also in effect. The sale of local products through railway business offices provides a convenient shortcut for the production and marketing of local goods, facilitating the transportation of goods.</p>
<p>(4) Matters Related to Production and Marketing: (A) In terms of domestic production, Guangdong's light and heavy industries have developed considerably. Imports of light industrial products such as cotton cloth and paper have decreased, indicating a potential resurgence of these domestic goods. (B) Product and marketing controls: Silk cocoons and cotton yarn are subject to the organization of control committees. (C) Cooperative enterprises: According to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, there are a total of 14,649 cooperatives nationwide. Credit cooperatives account for over 76%, while those managing production and marketing account for 8.9%. As a result, although wharves may decline and middlemen may lose their profits, these efforts are significantly effective in improving the production and marketing of domestic goods.</p>
<p>(5) Matters Related to Financial Services: (A) The Savings Bank Law has been promulgated, and regulations on savings reserves have been established. (B) Branches of various banks are being established and expanded, moving into the interior and providing agricultural loans, gradually channeling funds back into rural areas. (C) Urban money shops are becoming more like banks, and inland banks are establishing offices in nearby villages and towns, a trend some call the "bank-ification" of money shops. (D) In terms of cooperation among banks, loans to the government for construction and disaster relief total nearly 130 million yuan for the year. In terms of cooperation and mutual assistance among peers, in addition to joint reserves and bill exchanges, banks are collaborating on loans or jointly running secondary businesses, adhering to the principle of unified action to avoid competition. This is an improvement in financial services.</p>
<p>In addition, the victories in bandit suppression, the stability of the situation in Shaanxi and Henan, and the good harvests in Jiangbei, Hebei, and the Northwest are fortunate. The upward trend in bond prices, with no drastic fluctuations throughout the year, also shows a gradual stabilization of public sentiment. Some say that improvements in the management of finance, the organization of cooperative industries, etc., are now beginning to show results. The gradual implementation of the mortgage system and the closer proximity of production to transportation and consumption may also be signs of gradual improvement in the economy.</p>
<p>As described above, although these are just the starting points of improvement efforts, they are indeed a glimmer of hope for the economy. Just like a chronically ill person who receives proper care, a positive turnaround can be expected. Banks, with their position of maintaining and assisting, should do their best to fulfill their responsibilities, and our bank, with its mission to develop industry, must work hard to achieve this. The work of the past year has shown considerable results. Fortunately, banks are now shifting from individual competition to a united front, cooperating to serve society. This is another positive development among peers, which can be viewed with optimism. (To be continued)</p>

The ministry instructed the school to inform the student that graduation certificates issued by puppet organizations could not be recognized as valid. However, if the student wished to study in the mainland, they could apply to the Northeast Youth Education Relief Agency for screening and testing in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Northeast Students Entering and Transferring to Schools." According to Article 1 of the measures, students from areas relatively distant from the peace could be examined by the local educational administrative authority entrusted by the agency for the purpose of providing relief.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Students at Guangdong's Zhongda High School Oppose the Joint Examination, Leading to a Serious Strike <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Principal Zou Lu Held a School Board Meeting Yesterday and Expelled the Leading Students. The Students' Attitude is Firm, and the Education Department Decided to Comply with the Law.</p>
<p>(Guangzhou News) More than 300 students in the 24th grade of the Guangdong National Sun Yat-sen University High School have been on strike since the 27th due to their opposition to participating in the Education Department's high school graduation joint examination. The school and the Education Department have taken a very firm stance. The school held a school board meeting yesterday (29th) and planned to expel the leading troublemaking students and limit all students to resume classes. The strike situation may worsen. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>High School Organization</p>
<p>The high school affiliated with Sun Yat-sen University was originally reorganized from the university's preparatory course. In the 19th year, the preparatory course was discontinued and second-year high school students were recruited. In the autumn of the 20th year, all grades of the high school affiliated with the university were merged and co-organized, and first-year students were recruited, thus establishing a high school department with a four-year history. The high school department's school system adopts the academic year system, dividing the general curriculum into two groups, A and B. Students who wish to study liberal arts in the future take the Group A course, and those who wish to study science, engineering, medicine, or agriculture take the Group B course. In order to emphasize the cultivation of talents in Group B, the ratio of Group A to Group B in the recruitment of new students in the 22nd year was 1:6, and in the 23rd year, it was 1:2. Over the years, the school has not participated in the government's past joint examinations because its curriculum and nature are different from other high schools, and most of its students go on to study at the university.</p>
<p>Cause of the Strike</p>
<p>Recently, in order to unify the high school student graduation joint examination, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to the Education Departments of various provinces and national universities that all national, provincial, and municipal high schools or affiliated high schools must participate in the graduation joint examination organized by the highest education administrative agency in the province to show uniformity. The Guangdong Education Department, upon receiving the order, immediately forwarded it to Sun Yat-sen University for reference and requested that the list of high school students for the first semester of this year be sent to the department for numbering. The school authorities decided to participate in the joint examination in June in order to comply with government orders and to show the students' abilities, as the Sun Yat-sen University High School had been criticized by the outside world for its low student level for not participating in the joint examination in previous years.</p>
<p>Student Opposition</p>
<p>After learning about this, the students of Sun Yat-sen University High School held a temporary meeting on the 10th and agreed that since the high school curriculum was different from other schools and they had never participated in the joint examination in the past, they would never participate in this action. At the same time, a method was proposed: if they did not participate in the graduation joint examination, they could at most not enter other universities, but they should be allowed to enter the university department of this school. They asked the principal to accept this opinion. When Principal Zou Lu refused, all 300 students issued a declaration and went on strike on the 27th.</p>
<p>Principal's Attitude</p>
<p>After receiving the students' request, Principal Zou Lu immediately stated that he could not accept it because the graduation joint examination was a national education matter, a matter outside the school, not within the school. However, the joint examination was scheduled for June, which was imminent. The school had no choice but to obey the government's order to hold it. When the Education Department held the high school student joint examination, whether the students participated or not was up to them. He would not care. When the students decided to strike, Zou Lu reported everything to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the School Board and scheduled a School Board meeting for the 29th to discuss concrete measures to deal with the situation. As for the Education Department, it stated that it would only follow the government's orders and let the students participate or not participate, and it would not care.</p>

<p>(Xuzhou, 29th) Zhou Fohai has been inspecting provincial and county schools and social education institutions in Xuzhou for several days and is very satisfied. He took the Longhai train east yesterday morning to inspect the Yun Canal Normal School. On the 30th, he will transfer from the Yun Canal to Suqian for inspection.

<h3 id="e172">Science Exhibition at Soochow University <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The science department of Soochow University in Suzhou has complete equipment and has long been famous in the Southeast. In order to meet the needs of the times, Dr. Yang Yongqing, the president of the school, held a science exhibition two years ago, which won a lot of praise. The school held its second exhibition on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of this month, and a brief description is recorded as follows. The popularized science lectures and exhibition were held in the Science Museum and were divided into three parts: physics, chemistry, and biology. The route for visitors and the arrangement of instruments and specimens all complied with the scientific procedure. The heads of each department, such as Dean Pan Shenming of the Chemistry Department, Dr. Li Qingxian of the Physics Department, and Dr. Zhang Hecen of the Biology Department, together with senior students of all levels, were assigned to each department to conduct various experiments and lectures. All visitors who had questions were given repeated instructions until they understood.</p>
<p>Highlights of the Content</p>
<p>(1) Physics Department: Divided into eight rooms, all subjects such as acoustics, optics, mechanics, heat, and electricity were classified and detailed explanations and diagrams were attached. The teachers and students also gave enthusiastic explanations and experiments to make it clear to the visitors. Among them, the electrocardiograph, the huge astronomical telescope, the large vacuum tube for sending international telegrams, and the annual red lights in each room were especially eye-opening for the viewers. According to a receptionist, the school tried its best to purchase domestic products for all instruments and electrical materials, and it was said that the quality of domestic products was not only far superior to that of the eastern neighbors, but also inferior to that of Europe and the United States. (2) The Biology Department had even more categories, such as the animal and plant group, the embryonic inheritance group, the human anatomy group, the animal and plant preparation group, and the economic animal and plant group. The economic animal and plant group was especially interesting. The silkworm paper, oil fruits, and microorganisms for making soy sauce, as well as pathogenic bacteria related to human clothing, food, housing, etc., were all listed in their original form. Professor Liu Chengjian of the school collected more than 100 species of fish, reptiles, and amphibians in Wuxian County, which was especially interesting. Other things such as the evolution of various microscopes and human mechanical diagrams can all give people a general scientific knowledge. The school's attached biological materials office is divided into three parts: skeleton specimens, device specimens, and glass slide specimens. It supplies 50,000 to 60,000 pieces to domestic universities and middle schools every year. In recent years, Western schools have also purchased from the office several times a month. This is not only a meaningful contribution, but also a significant way to prevent leakage. (3) The Chemistry Department is divided into six departments, including physiological industry, organic and inorganic. The food nutrition specimens in the physiology department and the mechanical specimens of vitamin components are especially valuable to the public. Industrial chemistry, such as papermaking, pigments, soaps, distilled water, and gas, all have their manufacturing procedures and chemical steps analyzed in detail. The distilled water item is supplied to all hospitals in Suzhou and has received good reviews. Other things such as gas masks can also give viewers military common sense. The structure of this mask uses the absorption of charcoal. Because charcoal has the property of absorbing odors, toxic gas enters the nostrils through the charcoal tube, which filters and stores the gas, which is harmless to life. In addition, various special phenomena and anomalies in science are too many to describe in detail.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm of the Visitors: The exhibition period was three days. In the first two days, the number of visitors was no less than six or seven thousand. The school also held a calligraphy and painting and flower show at the same time. Although the visitors browsed separately, they were still shoulder to shoulder and overcrowded. The school organized all men and women in the city. All secondary schools suspended classes to visit. There were also people from other cities, such as people from military, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and other sectors, as well as parents of students from the school. From this, it can be seen that the interest of Chinese people in science has gradually increased.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Graduate Joint Examination Group of the Middle School Normal Education Research Association Continued Its Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>A Detailed Discussion on the Issues of the Graduation Joint Examination System. The Training and Military Group Meeting Will Continue This Afternoon.</p>
<p>The Graduate Joint Examination Group of the Middle School Normal Education Research Association of this city held its second research meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. The Training and Military Group meeting will continue at Lakeside Club at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Graduate Joint Examination Group</p>
<p>Present were Chen Jicheng, Shen Tilan, Feng Yixian, Wu Youxiao, Tao Guangchuan, Tang Naikang, Xu Renhan, Yang Daohong, Wang Zhongming, Jin Yuezhang, Qian Fugong of the Education Bureau, and Zhang Zhu. Chen Jicheng chaired the meeting and Shen Tilan recorded it. The research questions were: (1) The method of calculating and disclosing graduation grades. The result of the discussion was: A. Graduation grades are calculated by averaging the joint examination grades and school grades, each accounting for one-half. B. The method of disclosing graduation grades is based on the joint examination grades, but those who fail the joint examination but whose average with the school grades is passing should be noted. C. The standards for rewards and punishments for graduation grades are based on the joint examination grades, not the school grades. D. The current method of disclosing graduation grades should be revised as follows: (2) The ratio of students participating in the graduation joint examination to the number of graduation joint examinations and the number of omissions. Paper-based joint examination grades are counted without counting school grades. (3) The total average of the joint examination grades of students participating in the graduation joint examination in each school still follows the example of calculating the school joint examination grades and does not need to be calculated. (2) The temporary proposal submitted at the last meeting: whether the graduation joint examination system should continue to exist or be replaced by other methods. Shen Tilan advocated abolishing the joint examination system and replacing it with a random testing system. Xu Renhan advocated abolishing the joint examination system and replacing it with a national examination system. Jin Yuezhang advocated abolishing the joint examination system and seeking other methods to remedy it. (3) The date of the next meeting was set for 3:00 PM on May 8 at the Lakeside Club.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Chinese Cultural Construction Association Extends Registration Period for Reading Competition <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>To Avoid Disappointing Scholars, Extension to May 15th</p>
<p>After the Chinese Cultural Construction Association independently organized the National Reading Competition, registration offices were set up in the association's branches in various provinces and cities. Since the start of registration, participation has been very enthusiastic, with dozens to hundreds of people registering every day, demonstrating that many scholars in our country are eager to seek further studies in academic research. The association, considering that our country is vast and remote areas have significant transportation difficulties, and to avoid disappointing scholars, the original registration deadline was set for April 30th, but has been extended by half a month to May 15th. All branch registration offices have been notified to comply with this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the various reading lists and reference books for the university group and middle school group designated by the association have been specially discounted and sold by various bookstores, according to letters from various participating members, the prices of various books that need to be purchased for the university group are still considered too high. It seems that reference books can be purchased selectively, or a reading group can be formed by three or five members to read in turns. This method can also be considered for adoption.</p>

<p>This time, the Macau Tao Ying Ping Pong Team's expedition to Shanghai was enthusiastically promoted by Xu Tingzuo, General Manager of Yili Soda Company, who donated a silver cup to the winner, which was managed by the Chinese Ping Pong Association. As a result, the strong Postal Workers, Guangdong, and Meifeng teams in Shanghai defeated the Tao Ying team by a score of 4 to 3 each. The Joint Conference decided to produce a champion by the elimination system. After drawing lots, the first day was Postal Workers vs. Meifeng. Last night was the final between Postal Workers and Guangdong. Many visitors were very professional. The Joint Conference considered the importance of the competition and specially invited Wu Maoqing as the referee, Chen Linsheng as the inspector, and Ma Tingliang to write the record. When the bell rang at eight o'clock, the notary Hu Jia made a sound, and the battle began. You came and went, fighting fiercely, making the sky dark and the earth dim, shocking and alarming. The audience around was silent. After three hours of competition, the Postal Workers team took advantage of the remaining prestige of defeating Meifeng the night before, and relied on the fate of the generals, ruthlessly harvested the Guangdong team with a score of 5 to 2. At the end, Xu Duo, Chairman of the Mountain Joint Conference, gave congratulatory speeches and awards. This dazzling Macau-Shanghai Cup was laughingly taken away by Lu Xiuli, the captain of the Postal Workers team, amidst the cheers of the audience. The results of yesterday's competition are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>(Translated by Jiang Lianggui, not to be reproduced)</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Lianggui has a lot of research on sports science and is currently teaching at the East Asia Sports College. He recently translated "Track and Field Training Method Illustrations" written by Robertson and Saki, coaches of the American track and field team at the 10th World Games. The article provides detailed analysis and illustrations for the entry methods, practice points, and the application of mechanics for each track and field event, supplementing the lack of text and making it easy for readers to compare the text and illustrations at a glance. With the track and field season approaching, we will disclose it daily in this column. We hope readers will pay attention to it (Editor's Note).</p>
<p>(1) Javelin</p>
<p>The javelin is one of the ancient sports. In the past, people used it as a weapon in warfare. In modern times, it has become one of the sports. Athletes who want to practice this sport must have considerable speed and a developed and healthy upper body with sensitive neurological responses. Of course, the javelin is the same as other sports. Those with tall stature have considerable convenience, but they must also have superior speed and the ability to fully coordinate the muscles of various parts of the body to assist them. It is not enough to rely solely on physical strength.</p>
<p>There are two methods of throwing the javelin, depending on the gait.</p>
<p>(A) Crossover Step</p>
<p>(Figure 1) The above picture shows the posture of the javelin thrower when moving forward. Athletes can gain experience to determine whether the steps they take are appropriate. Each practice should be measured in advance to develop a habit of fixed steps, so as not to have the disadvantage of disordered steps during the competition.</p>

<p>— (Master of Qifeng Tower)</p>
<p>Bismarck of Germany once said; "What we rely on today is only white iron and red blood." How majestic and thorough these words are, but the cruel policy of ambitious people has been completely exposed!</p>
<p>"Failure is the mother of success." This is to encourage people to continue to study diligently after a failure in a matter, and continue to study tirelessly, and there will naturally be a day to achieve success. If they are discouraged by failure, then the saying "mother of success" is equal to nonsense!</p>
<p>What parents give is love, and what lovers give is love. If we compare it with fruits, then love is like a peach, and love is like a Buddha's hand. Peaches are the most delicious and edible, but they will rot after a while. Although Buddha's hands are for people to play with and smell, they become dry and fragrant and do not dissipate.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Tea Picking <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>Before the silkworm business is busy at home, tea leaves are a small product during this period. The whole family is busy picking, drying, and selling them for money. Part of the household expenses has to be subsidized by the money sold in this barren spring season.</p>
<p>Every garden of fruit trees is planted with lush tea trees. It can be said that no one in the village can compare with the lushness of my family's tea trees. People standing inside picking tea cannot be seen from the outside. These are all the hard work of my grandmother over the past few decades. She always cares with experience; fertilizing with firewood ash once a year, and how to cut off the old branches to make new buds sprout from the roots.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was very happy because my small hands and feet could pick quickly, and I could always pick more than adults, so I would often be prevented from going to school for more than ten days in a row.</p>
<p>Every morning, I would follow my grandmother, mother, and sister JIn, with bamboo baskets hanging around their necks, to the mountain to pick tea. We smiled happily, dragged our light steps, and the dew on the spring grass stained our shoes and socks. We listened to the pleasant birdsong in the forest, and watched the eastern morning sun gradually rise higher.</p>
<p>When picking tea, the mothers would always talk about things that I had never heard at home, but I would sing out-of-tune mountain songs alone.</p>
<p>This scene seems like a moment in time, and now I am already the father of two children. Grandmother passed away five years ago. Sister Jin could pick tea, but was frightened by a snake touching her fingers on the tree, and died of a serious illness. Every year when the tea market is about to fall, my mother always cries with swollen eyes on the day of Sister Jin's death anniversary.</p>
<p>Now, these lush tea trees can only be picked by my mother alone, getting up early and grinding late. After picking in this garden, the tea buds in that garden have already "fired", so the tea buds that are picked and dried are not as fine as those of others and cannot be sold for a good price.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Pickpocketing Like a King <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>"Pickpocketing Like a King" is a Hangzhou dialect phrase, equivalent to the Shanghai expression "knocking someone for a bamboo pole" and the Northern saying "extorting." People from other places may not understand other Hangzhou phrases, but they will always learn and comprehend the phrase "Pickpocketing Like a King."</p>
<p>"Everyone fears being pickpocketed like a king," but outsiders visiting Hangzhou inevitably get pickpocketed to some extent. It's understandable, as Hangzhou's economy relies on the three spring months. If they don't pickpocket those visiting playboys, young ladies, and wives, or those devout female believers wearing yellow cloth bags and chanting Amitabha, how would they survive drinking the northwest wind?</p>
<p>On the other hand, in recent years, Hangzhou has been designated as a national scenic area, and significant progress has been made in all aspects of construction. The bad habit of "pickpocketing like a king" has been reduced considerably. In the past, tourists in Hangzhou were most likely to be "pickpocketed like a king" when hiring boats, cars, and sedan chairs. Now, the Hangzhou government has set fixed prices and posted them in prominent places, allowing outsiders to know the rates at a glance and avoid being deceived. For example, renting a small boat to row on the lake used to cost five or six yuan, or even ten or eight yuan, per day. Now, the price is fixed at one yuan and fifty cents per day, one yuan for half a day, and two cents per hour, which is very convenient for people. As for food, due to the economic downturn, restaurants offer budget-friendly set meals, which are fixed and don't allow for pickpocketing. As for accommodation, hotels sell at fixed prices during these months, which are cheaper than Shanghai, but the extras can still be as expensive as in Shanghai.</p>
<p>People who go to Hangzhou always like to buy some local Hangzhou products, such as Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors, Shu Lianji's fans, and Wang Yutai's tea. These are brand-name products and won't be overpriced. However, if you buy lotus root powder, Chinese nutmeg, olives, etc., you need to be careful, or you might get "pickpocketed like a king."</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Ashamed of Being Unclothed, He Avoids Guests Behind a Curtain; Diligently Saves Lamp Oil, Transcribing Books at Dawn</p>
<p>He heard that I was there to visit and looked at what I was wearing from head to toe. He suspected I was an investigator from the provincial committee checking on their performance, so he quickly went inside to report, inviting the principal and teachers out. Logically, the students should all be old, and the teachers should be an old man, right? But what came out was another surprise. The principal was only in his twenties, and the teachers were not much older. I explained my intentions to them. The principal was very modest, saying there was nothing worth seeing. I said that I wanted to introduce the difficult situation of running education in the interior to the outside world to gain support from the people of the country. Seeing my sincere attitude, he led me inside. There is no need to describe the simplicity of the entire organization. Once we sat down to talk, I learned that the entire school, inside and out, consisted of only the principal and one teacher. There was also a handyman who took care of everything, including the gatekeeping and cooking. Because it was an ancient temple, there were three classrooms. However, a group of students around twenty years old were not in the classrooms attending class. Each held a copy of a thousand-character text, some wandering in the courtyard, some reciting aloud under the eaves. Some were reciting "It does not matter how high, as long as there is a fairy, it will be famous." Others were reciting "Mencius saw King Hui of Liang, and the king said, 'Old man.'" There were also two children of eight or nine years old, jumping and shouting, reciting "Camel, cart. Satchel, horse, cow." It turned out they were reciting picture recognition words used in kindergarten. Even if it was considered an improved private school, something was off. They shouldn't be running around the courtyard to read, so what was the point of the classrooms? Zhou Yourong laughed: "I've been a county magistrate in Shaanxi for almost a year, but I didn't know that education in the interior was like this." How bad was the order, and how did the principal react to you? Zhiqian said: "I think they are probably used to it and don't find it strange." (193)</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>No matter the craft, a novice is never used; every newcomer must first immerse themselves in learning, and only after years of study will they have the opportunity to work. As for the leading artisans, it is even more difficult! Before becoming leaders, they must have years of outstanding achievements before being promoted. At the same time, their assistants must constantly strive to prepare for future promotion to leadership. As long as the original leader is older and no longer capable of performing well, a new leader is selected from the group of assistants who have been trained for many years to fill the position. Therefore, their craftsmanship will never decline, and they all have a consistent spirit and secret, like a hereditary profession passed down from father to son. Although in reality, they all have different backgrounds, with little blood or kinship between them, their spirit is like that of a family, which is different from the outside world!</p>
<p>Looking back now, the expenses within the palace were indeed enormous. Just from these crafts alone, it was enough to scare people to death. I lived in the palace for so many years, and I can say that not a day went by without new phoenix shoes being made and sent to the Empress Dowager for her to evaluate and inspect. At least one or two pairs, and up to five or six pairs, were sent every day. The accumulated number over a month or a year was naturally very large, and the amount of this expense was imaginable—but this was not surprising, because shoes were still a small thing. What was even stranger was that those large palace robes and embroidered clothes were also produced just as wastefully. (303)</p>
<h3 id="e201">Fallen Petal Season <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Flowers belong to the feminine realm. Throughout history, scholars and poets have often used flowers to symbolize women, as a shadow of women, because all flowers are delicate, weak, and unable to withstand the wind and rain. Once they are blown off, they fall to the ground, to be trampled on. The blooming and falling of flowers is only a matter of a few days of glory, a flash in the pan, fleeting, just like the life encounters of ill-fated beauties. Therefore, flowers have become confidantes of boudoirs, and women ultimately love flowers.</p>
<p>I remember in "Dream of the Red Chamber," Lin Daiyu, seeing fallen petals all over the ground with no one to sweep them, thought of the fragility of life and wrote "The Burial of Flowers," comparing herself to fallen flowers separated from their branches. She even felt that people were inferior to flowers.</p>
<p>"Fallen Petal Season," when cuckoos cry blood, is a season of common sorrow.</p>
<p>Now, there is a new film from a star, named "Fallen Petal Season," which is a poetic title, and the content must be very sad.</p>
<p>"Fallen Petal Season" tells the story of a woman who is hurt by spring, deceived by others, and wants to free herself, but in this male-dominated society, she will be met with obstacles. Not only is there no sympathetic assistance, but there are also people who ridicule and play with her—criticizing her—the result is that she suffers injustice and dies of illness. Although this is a fictional film, it is indeed a common occurrence in today's society. Who should be responsible for improving this situation in society?</p>
<p>Is the fate of women always as weak as flowers, easily stained with mud by the wind, and sinking?</p>
<h3 id="e202">Flower Protection Method <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— (Wei Yuan)</p>
<p>If you want to take flowers to another place, it is best to wrap them in wet newspaper first, and then in dry newspaper. The end of the stem can be rolled tightly, and the other end should be looser. This can extend the life of the flowers.</p>
<p>After the flowers are brought to their destination, they should be immersed in a bucket of water, and short-stemmed flowers should be placed in a bowl.</p>
<p>Only change the water in the vase, don't add more. Adding a little salt to the water will keep the flowers bright.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Spring Cuisine <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yi</p>
<p>Seasonal Vegetables: In spring, all kinds of plants are just sprouting and growing. In terms of food, it is only good to eat the tender buds of vegetables. At this time, they are all on the market for meals, such as wolfberry shoots, aster scaber, toon shoots, etc., all of which are excellent vegetarian dishes, each with its own unique flavor. At this time of the Qingming Festival, the Taichi pond vegetables are picked for their fine buds and mixed with ham, tender bamboo shoots, shredded chicken, etc., and cooked into a soup. The greasy and fresh taste is truly unique. No wonder Mr. Zhang Jiying wanted to give up his official position and go home to eat pond vegetable soup.</p>
<p>Fish Soup: The pond fish in spring (Suzhou vulgar name, shape similar to the loach) is the most beautiful fresh fish for cooking soup. The fresh and tender fish meat, especially the two unique live pieces of meat on the fish cheeks, about the size of broad beans, are particularly delicious. When cooking the soup, first remove the fish skin, then remove the fish bones, and then cook with tender bamboo shoots and ham in chicken broth. The fresh and clean taste is truly the best appetizer. In spring, the fish meat is also unusually fresh and tender. Cooking soup with ham and tender bamboo shoots is also exceptionally delicious. Adding a little vinegar to the fish soup has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>Soft-shelled Turtle: Soft-shelled turtle is a common name. The soft-shelled turtles in spring are all small juveniles, and the meat and skirt are very tender. Therefore, when the cole flowers are yellow and the peonies are in bloom, soft-shelled turtles are very precious, called cole flower turtles and peony turtles, and the price is very expensive. To cook soft-shelled turtle, first kill the turtle (those with a red belly are poisonous, you should choose those with a white belly), cut the abdomen with a knife, peel off the black skin on the outside in boiling water, and then wash it clean in clear water. Braised or stewed soft-shelled turtle both have wonderful flavors. However, soft-shelled turtle, like "wearing armor," must be cooked with pork. Only by using the fat oil of pork will it be greasy and delicious to eat. The seasonings for braised soft-shelled turtle should be slightly sweet. The best part of the soft-shelled turtle is the skirt around the body, which is fat and tender. Eating it is truly delicious.</p>
<p>Chicken and Eel: Stewed chicken and eel is also a seasonal delicacy in spring. Kill and wash the fat yellow eel, cut it into small pieces, then cut the raw chicken into small pieces, and slowly stew them with ham and tender bamboo shoots over low heat. When the cooking is done, the taste of the chicken and eel is very delicious. Especially the clear soup, clear to the bottom, is more fresh and clean than any other dish.</p>
<p>Bamboo Shoot Oil: After the rain, there are countless spring bamboo shoots. Bamboo shoots are the most common vegetables in spring. The advantage of bamboo shoots is that whether they are cooked with meat, cooked vegetarian, seasoned, or cooked alone, they have their own unique flavor. In addition to cooking vegetables, bamboo shoots can also be used to make oil. To cook bamboo shoot oil, first cut the bamboo shoots into small pieces, heat a large pot of oil, and when the oil is hot, pour the bamboo shoots into the oil and slowly cook them until they are cooked. Then add soy sauce and cook until cooked. After that, put it in a ceramic jar and store it through the summer. This kind of bamboo shoot oil is fresh and fragrant and is a wonderful vegetarian product. Adding a few spoonfuls of bamboo shoot oil when eating noodles is truly no less delicious than mushroom oil!</p>

<p>From Rise to Fall… Drop of Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday, because the US bank's policy was not yet announced, people's hearts were relatively stable, and there was still an upward trend at the opening. Later, because the price of Indian silver fell and then rose again, foreign speculators continued to sell, and the central bank also put pressure on it, making it difficult for people's hearts to hold on. Large players fluctuated in many ways, lacking support, and another round of decline began, with a particularly sharp fall. The trend was difficult to grasp, and people's hearts were also extremely disturbed. Early in the morning, foreign telegrams reported a sudden fall in the price of British and American silver. The Mondelez forward silver market also narrowed by 8 basis points to 1.42 basis points, and the exchange rate lengthened slightly. The London gold price rose by 6.5 pence, and people's hearts seemed satisfied. It was reported that the US Treasury Department was gathering experts to discuss revising the silver purchase policy. Although it had been reported by foreign telegrams earlier, it was still able to generate some buying interest. The initial opening of off-market pre-trade rose to 68-69 yuan, lacking sellers. Large players such as Huixiang and others entered the market, and it rose to 75-76 yuan. Fuyu, Hengyu and others took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and it fell back to 71-72 yuan. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the pound unchanged and the US dollar rising. The customs gold unit rose by 6 basis points, and the gold standard price rose to 835.9 yuan and then rose again. The morning opened at a high, and after opening, the Central, China and other banks took advantage of the high price to sell sterling, boosting the selling pressure and falling into the 70 yuan range. However, because the bank's appetite was still healthy, there was a lot of struggle. The HSBC bank's listed prices were announced, with the pound unchanged and the US dollar rising by 0.0625. Sassoon suddenly sold, and it was weak for a while. Although it rose back to over 70 yuan due to the bank's efforts, Sassoon continued to sell, and it soon fell again. However, people's hearts were still stable, and buyers gathered after the low, and the bank's buying appetite was still healthy, so the overall trend was high. At noon, it turned into a rebound, but the situation was latent and disturbing. In the afternoon, the price of Indian silver was reported to have fallen by 18.16.14 Anna, and rose to 75-76 yuan. Large players took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and it fell slightly again. After the opening, the price fell because large players took advantage of the high price to sell. The price of Indian silver rose again by 14.12.10 Anna, and then turned weak. The Jewish merchant Joe Jifu suddenly sold sterling, and the exchange market eased, and sellers were active. The price fluctuated and fell, but it rose from time to time in the middle. Finally, because the central bank forcefully sold sterling, the price of Indian silver rose by 4 Anna again, breaking the 60 yuan range and closing the market quite weakly. The trading volume was quite active throughout the day, and the swap premium rose to 18 yuan. The day's market conditions will be recorded later,</p>

<h3 id="e206">Fourth Attempt to Pass Through the Threshold; Call Loan Rate Rises to 18% <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>For days, the silver market faced the difficult challenge of "four thresholds," severely impacting the money market. Although the major banks worked hard to maintain stability and avert crisis, it is undeniable that the vitality of the market has been significantly weakened. Yesterday, long-term rollovers faced challenges. Creditors wanted to collect, but debtors could not pay, resulting in further extensions. Both sides experienced considerable difficulty. Due to tight money conditions, the foreign call loan rate rose, reaching 18% in both morning and afternoon sessions, up 3% from the previous day. "Hua Tou Jia Shui" (premium for urgent transfers) also rose beyond 20%. Interbank call loan transactions were rare in the small clearing house, except for those with special relationships. Therefore, recent inflows and outflows were limited. Morning rollovers totaled over 2.8 million, with new transactions exceeding 400,000. Afternoon transactions exceeded 200,000. Transactions in the small clearing house amounted to 700,000. Foreign mortgage redemptions exceeded 500,000, with new short-term loans reaching 2.45 million. Customer deposits amounted to 400,000, and withdrawals were 300,000. Regarding banknote transactions, over 900,000 were collected, and 1.89 million were issued. Bank clearing operations showed foreign banks clearing over 3.34 million in banknotes, over 6.45 million in various goods and foreign exchange mortgages, over 780,000 in special remittances, over 1.22 million in foreign settlements, over 2 million in settlements, and 600,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese banks cleared over 3 million in banknotes, over 6.89 million in various loans and taxes, over 1.1 million in special remittances, over 1.56 million in foreign settlements, and 300,000 in warehouse entries. Japanese banks cleared over 2.23 million in banknotes, over 4.3 million in various goods and foreign exchange mortgages, over 1.56 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 900,000 in special remittances, and 800,000 in warehouse entries. Money shops cleared over 28 million in foreign public bills, over 5.8 million in foreign transfers, over 600,000 in various exchange bills, and over 1 million in cash conversions.</p>
<p>Since the financial crisis, little attention has been paid to the auxiliary currency market. Consequently, market prices have lacked intense competition, with only slight fluctuations. Yesterday, the Jiangjiao coin market appeared to decline slightly in the morning session, falling to 832 yuan per tael, but rebounded by 2.5 yuan in the afternoon to 834.5 yuan. Transactions in the morning session totaled 3,000 coins, and 6,000 coins in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver dollars were priced at 734.3 yuan in the morning session, dropping slightly by 0.8 yuan to 733.5 yuan in the afternoon. Transactions in the morning session totaled 215,000 coins, and 35,000 coins in the afternoon session. Copper coins remained unchanged at 337,000, with 43,040 strings traded, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Securities: Public Bonds Slightly Recover Due to Short Covering <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Gold Short Bonds Particularly Strong: Up 45 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a slight improvement due to a somewhat positive environment. There were expectations of changes in the U.S. silver purchase policy, the potential passage through the "four thresholds" crisis, closer relations between China and Japan, and no decline in Shanghai's silver reserves, but rather an increase. Confidence strengthened, and the market improved due to short covering. Market conditions revealed a substantial number of short positions, mostly held by large investors. Whether they needed to cover was uncertain. The market trend could be described as robust, with gold short bonds being the most sought-after. War bonds appeared weak in comparison. Previously, war bonds were 3-4 yuan higher than gold short bonds, but now gold short bonds are over 1 yuan higher than war bonds. This phenomenon clearly indicates that many are abandoning war bonds in favor of gold short bonds. This is because gold short bonds offer better terms than war bonds and have a shorter maturity. With a little research, the advantages and disadvantages are obvious. The trend is expected to gradually shift. If the environment remains unchanged, prices should rise. Yesterday, at the opening of the morning session, various factions gradually increased their buying interest, with No. 48 being particularly active in purchasing, while No. 52 sold significantly. Prices rose by 0.15-0.45 yuan. In the second session, the front rows continued to rise by 0.2-0.3 yuan, while the back rows were slightly weaker. At the opening of the afternoon session, prices were mostly stable, slightly improving by around 0.1 yuan. At the close, the bulls showed some profit-taking, with a slight decline of around 0.1 yuan, but this did not indicate a downward trend. Overall, prices rose, ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 yuan, with gold short bonds rising by 0.4-0.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was 6.47 million yuan. The table below shows the price changes: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<p>A report from Sin Fung Trading Co. yesterday (April 27th) stated that the New York stock market declined due to extensive profit-taking by bulls. The world silver price plunged, causing silver stocks to fall as well. However, traders anticipate good developments soon. Short covering occurred in railroad stocks, as the Supreme Court will rule on the Railroad Workers' Pension Act next Monday. It is widely speculated that the railroad authorities may win the case. The bond market remained firm, while stocks on the small exchange were mixed with a soft undertone. The half-day trading volume was 590,000 shares.

<p>Yarn Price at 182 Yuan...Volume 2,900 Bales; Cotton Price at 34.5 Yuan...Volume 4,000 Bales</p>
<p>The April Gold Rooster brand yarn contract, listed on November 1st of last year, opened at 183.6 yuan, slightly declining to 182.2 yuan. Subsequently, Mr. Wu and several other influential individuals took long positions, fueled by market rumors of potential inflationary policies in China. Sentiment soared, and buying interest was strong, reaching a peak of 189.6 yuan. However, the Shanghai financial crisis at the end of the lunar year caused significant panic, with bank closures and runs on money shops, creating an extremely serious situation that severely impacted commerce. At the beginning of the spring season, the market abruptly reversed. By March 12th, American cotton had plummeted over 100 points. Adding insult to injury, market conditions became even more difficult to sustain, breaking through the 180 yuan mark. Fortunately, local yarn was still in high season, with spring sales developing.</p>
<p>Customer demand was still strong, with purchases arriving from southern ports. Yarn inventories at various factories gradually decreased, from over 70,000 bales to over 60,000 bales. Therefore, despite the poor environment, the actual situation remained relatively stable. Mr. Wu insisted on taking delivery, causing prices to rebound above 180 yuan, reaching a high of 183.9 yuan. More recently, due to the money market panic at the end of April, along with deliveries from inland factories, the market suffered a severe blow, falling back to 180.3 yuan. However, the long positions prepared to buy, and the final session remained firm at 183 yuan. As a result, 2,900 bales remained, with only 550 bales of 16-count "Earth" brand yarn delivered. The rest were settled through self-delivery at a price of 182 yuan. The broker codes and bale quantities for both the receiving and delivering parties are listed below: (Unit: Bales)</p>

<p>The April marked cotton contract, listed on November 1st of last year, opened at 36.15 yuan, declining to 35.85 yuan. However, Tong Cheng Co. and some cotton merchants aggressively bought, driving up prices. At the same time, rumors of currency reform circulated in the market, boosting confidence and attracting buyers. While cotton stocks piled up in the Northwest, spot traders showed strong interest in hoarding, and banks invested heavily, anticipating a price increase in the coming spring, reaching a peak of 38.75 yuan. However, during the settlement period, the money market experienced a major panic, with bankruptcies occurring frequently and extremely tight credit conditions. At the beginning of spring, overseas silver prices rose sharply, while gold fell. Foreign cotton became cheaper to import, and prices declined sharply. Banks and cotton merchants, facing economic hardship and unstable yarn factories, rushed to sell, exacerbating the situation. Market sentiment was difficult to sustain, and on March 12th, American cotton plunged by over 100 points. The fragile cotton market suffered a further blow, falling into a slump. The lowest price reached 33.05 yuan, but the long position of Mr. Shao held firm, with a strong intention to buy, and prices rebounded to 35.4 yuan. More recently, deliveries were sufficient, but the sharp rise in silver prices caused a dramatic drop in gold, leading to a decline in market sentiment and a drop back to 34.30 yuan. As a result, 6,000 bales remained, including 4,000 bales of Shandong coarse cotton, Tianjin coarse cotton, and Yao cotton. The rest were settled through self-delivery at a price of 34.50 yuan, with Mr. Shao receiving the most. The broker codes and bale quantities for both the receiving and delivering parties are listed below: (Unit: Bales)</p>

<p>The yarn market remained calm, with spot yarn sales performing well. Market sentiment was stable. Overseas cotton prices declined slightly, while silver rebounded, and gold rose slightly. There were no significant changes in the market. Standard yarn and cotton trading was suspended for one day due to the month-end delivery process. Spot yarn trading saw various firms buying a total of 435 bales, with no significant price fluctuations. The purchase volume for each firm is as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha: 40 Nanjing: 2</p>
<p>Ningbo: 8 Guangdong: 215</p>
<p>Inland: 145 Xuzhou: 15</p>
<p>The cotton market saw no major price fluctuations. Although American and Indian cotton prices declined, silver also rebounded significantly, and gold rose slightly, offsetting the impact. Therefore, market sentiment was calm. Spot cotton factory demand was sluggish, but outward shipments of foreign cotton were improving last week.</p>
<p>Local Cotton: 41.10 yuan, Shenxin Factory imports 300 pieces, sent to factory.</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton: 41.75 yuan, Yongan Factory imports 135 pieces, sent to factory.</p>

<p>In mid-April, Shanghai's Hua Ri (Chinese-Japanese) yarn exports totaled 21,141 bales of Chinese yarn and 3,487 bales of Japanese yarn. Compared to the first ten days of April, Chinese yarn exports decreased by 9,360 bales, and Japanese yarn exports decreased by 633 bales. The decrease was due to a temporary slowdown in domestic customer purchases and the suspension of overseas exports due to unfavorable exchange rates. The mid-April export volumes are detailed below:</p>

<p>The Bombay cotton market was firm last week due to rising American cotton and silver prices. The main business for the week was the April-May Sipro-Creek new cotton contract. The price difference between new and old cotton has reached 17.5 rupees. News from the spot cotton sector is positive, with exporters being the major buyers. Mainland China, Japan, and Chinese carriers are paying close attention to Pingard and Olmra. Manufacturers are purchasing various standard grades. Yarn factory demand has decreased due to sluggish cloth sales. The weekly statistics are attached below: (Unit: Thousand Bales)</p>
<p>|  | 1934 | 1935 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Accumulation from September 1st | 1,796 | 1,807 |</p>
<p>| Weekend Inventory | 1,136 | 790 |</p>
<p>| Cumulative Exports since September 1st | 813 | 1,081 |</p>

<p>Liverpool's inquiries last week were good, but the required goods were scarce. The futures market was peaceful. Due to the decline in gold and the rise in silver, buying interest was not high. Egyptian cotton prices rose with American cotton, but transactions were limited.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Grains: Flour Market Skyrockets by Four Points This Month <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Forward Months Also Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the prices for all months initially appeared stable, then gradually rose. Foreign wheat quotations from both Chicago and Canada rebounded slightly by two to three points. After the opening, due to low foreign wheat quotations and clear weather, short positions were initially released, with the opening price at only 4.45 jiao. Subsequently, short covering became active. Customer firms did not show any signs of releasing their positions. However, with delivery approaching, short positions had to be covered. Furthermore, pre-arranged shipments for customer firms had already been loaded, but the required standards had not yet been purchased. These factors contributed to a squeeze. Subsequent opening prices rose steadily. As for the forward months, spring droughts in Shandong Province and sandstorms in Pingjin caused the price of wheat to increase by three points, leading to strong market sentiment. At the opening of the afternoon session, prices were initially stable, but the current month became increasingly squeezed, with short covering continuing without limit. The highest price reached 5.075 jiao (over 6 points higher than the morning opening). Forward months continued to rise due to the current month's situation and limited factory selling. Given this situation, half of the reason is the need to increase spot flour prices, and the other half is the drought situation in Hebei Province, which suggests that there is no hope for a price decline in the short term. As a result, the current month rose by 4 points, May rose by 3.25 points, June rose by 2.7 points, July rose by 3.2 points, August rose by 2.7 points, and September rose by 2.25 points. Old wheat arrivals continued.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Old Wheat Arrivals Continue; No Expectation of Excessive Price Increase <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat futures market yesterday, prices for all months remained stable. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago and Canada fell back by about three points. Although Pingjin faced sandstorms and Shandong Province reported early droughts, new wheat was expected to arrive in Jiangnan in about 20 days. Furthermore, old wheat from the Yangtze River, nearing its replacement, was arriving smoothly, with daily imports of around 10,000 bales. Due to the influx of spot goods, market sentiment remained calm, with gains of only two to three points, unlike the surge in the flour market. Transactions in the afternoon session were not very active, and prices fluctuated. In the long run, with old goods continuing to arrive, there is no reason for excessive price increases. As a result, July and August each rose by two points, while September rose by three points. The spot wheat market, due to abundant arrivals, saw stable high prices and weaker medium to low prices. Kaifeng Shandong Guiding wheat was priced at 3.95 yuan, Yingzhou Bengbu wheat at 3.93 yuan, Luohe wheat at 3.89 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 3.878 yuan. A total of 9,000 bales were handled by Che Feng.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Weather Clears Up; River Rice Falls While Foreign Rice Rises <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>River Rice</p>
<p>The source of supply of Shanghai's rice merchants is slightly more plentiful, with arrivals on the 26th and 27th (a total of over 5,000 stones). With the sudden clearing of the weather, market sentiment weakened, and sales on the street became sluggish. Furthermore, customer purchases were limited to only 500-600 bales from Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and other ports, causing the overall situation to soften. Prices for various grades of Hou Geng (glutinous rice) and late rice declined. Yin Bian (cloudy variation) was rare and remained stable. Regarding the arrivals of boats from the north river ports to Shanghai, the market for Qu Wei Bai Geng (white rice) was dull due to the weather turning hot, leading to slower trading. Prices for early thin rice and other grades were stagnant, with a slight price decline for higher grades. Lower grades and early rice saw declines ranging from a few fen to one jiao. Other grades also showed weakness. However, Yuan goods were rare, and delivery continued, with prices about one jiao higher.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Customer sales continued yesterday, but local sales were sluggish. Purchases were limited to higher grades of Saigon and Min Dang Xiaojiao. The Jiujiang, Hankou, and Nanjing markets were active again yesterday, but sales were also low. The demand from Jiangzhe and other inland regions was stronger, especially from Zhejiang Province. Overall, 27-28,000 bales of Saigon rice, 4,700 bales of Xiaojiao rice, and over 4,000 bales of Siamese rice were traded, mostly purchased by inland regions. Inland demand remained strong, so market sentiment remained positive. Trading was active yesterday, and prices have been rising by 3-5 fen. 客秈's (Customer Xian rice) trading was limited, and the market remained stable, but sellers were mostly optimistic and unwilling to easily sell their goods.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Stops Bidding <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw stable Guan Jin (Customs Gold Units), and the trend remained stable. The Public Association’s price range for 24 Coarse White Sugar was 16.7 yuan, but no deal was made. Higher-priced transit goods saw some transactions at 5.4 yuan. The Sugar Industry Cooperative held a bidding session yesterday. Due to unfavorable exchange rates, Guangdong Coarse White Sugar received a call from Guangdong to stop the bidding because the offer price was difficult to reconcile. The 2,000 bales of Dutch group's white sugar, with a bid price of 16.8 yuan, also did not trade. The local Zhenyu No. 1 cotton white sugar was priced at 16.1 yuan, with grades 2, 3, and 4 following suit. Only Chao Gang (潮帮) offered a few dozen bales of Huilai Qing goods, priced at 9.8 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Dried and Preserved Goods: Limited Arrivals of Tong'an Longan <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Due to high land prices, Tong'an longan has not been arriving for some time. It is also rumored that this year's new seedlings are in short supply, increasing customer optimism. A message was received that the highest grade must be close to 40 yuan, but it is difficult to arrive in Shanghai temporarily. A check of the Jinan ship imported from Xiamen yesterday showed a total of only 50 pieces, a very small number.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Stagnant, Factories Mostly Closed <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Unfavorable exchange rates and stagnant silk sales have led domestic silk shops to successively close due to economic conditions. Currently, only Meiya and two other companies are still operating, and even those are only working part-time. Demand for user silk is also declining. Few silk factories in Shanghai are still open (only Jiyu Maitai and two other silk factories). The silk industry is becoming increasingly pessimistic this spring. Today, 30 bales of Qilihuijing were imported by Kailiyanghang.</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Qimen, the price of raw tea has skyrocketed from 80 yuan to 105 yuan due to the large number of buyers. The cost of manufacturing and transporting it to Shanghai in the future will be over 200 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Local Estate's New Green Tea Now Available <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenmei green tea produced by local tea factories was released by Shenyuan Tea Shop. It is said that this new tea is from Zhuang tea in Shangyu, Zhejiang Province, and the quality is good. However, European tea companies are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the recent increase in overseas silver prices and the poor wheat harvest in Morocco this year, which has significantly reduced farmers' purchasing power. Only Xiehe Tianyu and other firms offered 60-70 yuan, which is 70% lower than last year's opening price and far from the cost of Chinese merchant arrivals, so no transactions were made.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Sui'an New Tea Rises Opportunistically <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Sui'an is a key tea-producing area in Zhejiang Province, producing approximately 8,000 dan annually. Its convenient transportation and relatively low manufacturing costs have attracted attention. In recent years, with the global economic downturn, foreign firms have favored cheaper teas, making Sui tea suitable for the needs of buyers. Therefore, while tea businesses in Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces have suffered significant losses in the past two years, Sui tea has been less affected. In the past, there were only nine tea firms in the county, but in the past four or five years, the number has increased to over twenty. Furthermore, tea firms in Shanghai and Hangzhou, which used to purchase Chun'an and Kaihua teas as raw materials, are now mostly switching to Sui tea, leading to increased sales. The new tea in the county has already sprouted. The mountain households in the southwest townships of Yaping, Dayuan, Xiyuan, Fenglin, and Fenkou, in order to produce high-quality tea and avoid price reductions from the firms, have started picking and processing tea earlier this year. In the past two days, many gardens have already opened. Tea firms are rushing to transport the new tea to Shanghai to be the first to market, and have sent staff to weigh and buy the tea. The future opening price is not expected to be lower than last year.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Advantage of Hunan Red Tea Remains Prominent <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Hunan has always been a region rich in tea production, especially with red tea accounting for the largest export volume. Although it has been hit by sluggish foreign sales in recent years, the market has narrowed. However, since the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the sales of Hunan tea to Russia have shown signs of recovery. In addition, the provincial authorities are working hard to revive the local tea industry, and the market is gradually improving. This year, new tea from Anhua, Xinhua, Taoyuan, Pingjiang, and Liuyang counties has already entered the market. Merchants from Jin, Yue, Hui, Han, and Shanghai, as well as local tea merchants, have flocked to the mountains to start their businesses. Money houses and tea firms in Hankou and Changsha are interested in investing and lending to tea companies, and the financial situation is quite flexible. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred foreign firms, tea firms, and tea companies this year. Junshan Guyu green tea and foreign firms' red tea Baihao have already been harvested one after another, and various companies are currently busy transporting funds and collecting tea. The market atmosphere is even more lively than last year.</p>

<p>Ninety-pound Italian double-linked iron: The market price rose by another twenty-five cents the day before yesterday, with each box priced at twenty-nine yuan and fifty cents. Only factories in this street are doing well, while merchants from other regions are just inquiring. According to investigations by foreign firms, very few goods have arrived recently, so the market still has a trend of further rise.</p>

<h3 id="e224">American Popular Songs After the Arrival of the Depression <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Sen</p>
<p>In 1929, the United States began an unprecedented depression. Countless factories closed down, and tens of thousands of people lost their jobs. The bridges of Boston became open-air hotels for the unemployed masses. The veterans petitioning outside New York City jokingly hung up the sign of a grand hotel in Chicago outside their dilapidated tents. Groups of unemployed people reached out to the White House for bread. - These sufferings were all reflected in their popular songs at the time, which became a mirror of the disaster of that suffering.</p>
<p>When this suffering first arrived, the happy "Yankees" (a common term for Americans) began to feel unhappy. So, the street poets who were starving also wrote countless unhappy songs. The most popular at the time was a song called "Give Yourself a pat on the back." As soon as this song came out, countless people who failed in the market sang like this:</p>
<p>"Smile and be happy!</p>
<p>For tomorrow we can't count the breaches of contract,</p>
<p>Let's mortgage it to him!"</p>
<p>This is a gloomy song of forced laughter in the era of depression. On the contrary, there is a bit of optimistic atmosphere in "Let's have another cup of coffee."</p>
<p>"The rainbow is now in the sky,</p>
<p>Let me have another cup of coffee!</p>
<p>Let me eat another meat bun!"</p>
<p>The depression of 1932 was even more severe, and more popular songs about the depression were produced. The most common were "Good times are coming so cheer up" and "Happy days are here again."</p>
<p>These are exactly a reflection of the "Yankee boy's" unyielding spirit, but the depression was too profound. When they couldn't bear it, they finally produced naked and desolate melancholic popular songs. The first to appear was "Brother, can you spare a dime?" From this time on, the street poets wrote truthfully and consistently. At that time, news of local bank closures was spreading everywhere in the United States, and sighs of unemployment were heard everywhere. In a popular song, there was a line that said:</p>
<p>"It's Monday,</p>
<p>I still only have a dime!" Everyone was oppressed by poverty and hunger, and humming "I still only have a dime" was indeed the most palatable sentimental line.</p>
<p>From 1932 to 1933, the dark clouds were still low. Hundreds of thousands of people who were once able to live a decent life fell into poverty, and the unemployment rate continued to rise. After these street poets were temporarily silent, they couldn't easily wait for an optimistic era to arrive, so they produced gloomy tunes like "Turn out the lights and go to sleep!"</p>
<p>"There's no more money in the bank!</p>
<p>There are no naughty children for us to spank!</p>
<p>What should we do after all?</p>
<p>Turn out the lights and go to sleep!"</p>
<p>This is almost a song sung with tears. It is indeed a strange phenomenon that the people of the optimistic, naturally blessed golden country would encounter such difficulties and be so heartbroken!</p>
<p>But Americans are not fatalists and will not always be so sad. As the economic situation improved slightly, they immediately became optimistic again. At the end of 1933, songs like "The road is open again" and "The cheer parade" appeared.</p>
<p>Under President Roosevelt's recovery plan, grand popular songs like "Marching along together" were produced.</p>
<p>"Marching along,</p>
<p>Sharing smiles and tears,</p>
<p>Marching along,</p>
<p>Whistling that the sky will be clear." In the middle of this song, there are clearly still traces of material pain. Just like in another love song:</p>
<p>"Say, darling, do you have some money saved up?</p>
<p>That's all I need to know."</p>
<p>The poverty of overly utilitarian lovers is truly written humorously and vividly.</p>
<p>The short song that is currently sweeping across the United States, often used as a quote in politicians' speeches and major news articles, and makes everyone smile when they sing it, is the majestic "Who's afraid?"</p>
<p>"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?</p>
<p>The big bad wolf,</p>
<p>The big bad wolf,</p>
<p>Who's afraid of this...?"</p>
<p>Currently, the entire United States is singing this song with the same majestic force as a battle song. Everyone is humming it in their mouths, as if they want to scare away the terrible wolf of depression with the singing of all the American people.</p>
<p>By observing the content of these songs in general, we know that what is expressed in them is very real emotion. In the middle, there is the unyielding Yankee, the anti-fatalistic optimism, but also the sigh of despair. - How sincere and frank these emotions are!</p>

<p>— He Wei</p>
<p>Recently, my life has indeed been terrible. I have no certainty at all. I don't know if I will starve to death tomorrow. Living in a bathroom, I think about writing something to solve my life every day, but this hope is always slim, because once an article is written and sent out, there is no news from then on, and the so-called "hope" is over.</p>
<p>Although I rarely experience complete starvation, I taste the flavor of semi-starvation every day here. I eat a bowl of plain noodles for twelve copper coins each meal, plus two sesame cakes, which barely gets me by. Sometimes I just eat two sesame cakes.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of my day is spent borrowing money, regardless of the weather, whether it is cold winter or hot summer. Sometimes I wander on the road or by the river, sometimes I squeeze into third-class streetcars. When the weather is hot, I still drag around a tattered cotton robe. I am completely dazed and have lost consciousness. When I walk, I feel like I am floating in the air.</p>
<p>"Find a job!"</p>
<p>Friends kindly urge me. I think so myself, but the problem is this, because I am completely clueless about where to find a job. Every place is already full, and there is no room to stand. Sometimes I think it would be good to be a proofreader, but even this job that I used to despise a few years ago is so difficult.</p>
<p>It is strange how I have been able to live until now. According to many people's calculations, I should have died long ago, and even my bones should have already withered. But I am still able to live today, which makes many friends happy on the one hand, and makes many friends embarrassed on the other.</p>
<p>"You don't work, and you don't have any articles published. How do you live by borrowing a little money? You are really capable, really amazing!"</p>
<p>Most of these friends are very surprised. They carefully examine me, interrogate me, show suspicious faces, and grin with their white teeth.</p>
<p>"I don't believe it, maybe you are being supported by someone..."</p>
<p>Because they want to dance, watch plays, go to fancy restaurants, and even gamble, they naturally cannot understand my kind of life. They can't understand, but they shamelessly spread rumors, which I will never forget.</p>
<p>What is even more infuriating is that after many friends learned about my predicament, they retorted me as if I were lying:</p>
<p>"But your clothes are still quite clean!"</p>
<p>The meaning is that if I were really as embarrassed as you say, then I would undoubtedly be as filthy and ragged as a beggar. My current clothes seem a bit too dignified.</p>
<p>But my dear friends! I am not a beggar after all...</p>
<h3 id="e226">Mr. Kapitan (Part 1) <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>"Child, let me tell you: to live, you must risk your life. Do you think there is no danger if there are no wild boars? You are wrong. People sometimes eat people!" Leaving home, sitting in the third-class carriage filled with the smell of red betel nuts and the white mist of Elephant brand cigarettes, I, alone, was on my way back to that Western-style clothing store, remembering my father's words. The train wheels rumbled forward, and the car body swayed slightly. Sticking my head out, the world outside the window was vast.</p>
<p>More than two hours later, I arrived at the small pier where I had to get off. I jumped off the train with a large package on my back, which contained the necessities for a person's life. I didn't have the money to take a carriage, and it would take at least thirty minutes to walk to my destination.</p>
<p>I walked. The sun, which is always June-like, shone on my head, and two streams of sweat rolled down my forehead. Clenching my teeth, I was prepared to suffer some hardships on the journey of life and return here again.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's you? Why are you back again?" The boss came up to me, seemingly surprised, and asked.</p>
<p>I put down my package, panting, "Dad wanted me to come back, so—" I looked at the boss's pig-like face. He took a breath, touched his lips with his hand, and said to me, "You can live here." So, I carried my package back up to the dark and cramped little room on the third floor. I was just about to sit down on the hard bed board to rest when someone downstairs called my name.</p>
<p>It was the boss's wife. Her oily pockmarked face appeared on the stairs. This woman handed the grocery basket to me and, without waiting for me to ask, rattled off what she wanted to buy; at the same time, she gave me the money that should be paid to the pork stall or the vegetable stand, and walked away swaying her hips.</p>
<p>Life returned to the way it was before. The clerk who collected accounts recovered from his illness, and he still went out every day on that bicycle. "I'd be happy to encounter a wild boar once," he once said to me, "I don't know how many gardens and wildernesses I've walked through, but I haven't been able to see them." As if very disappointed, this guy shook his head. People who have never felt the dangers of life do not understand hardship - In the evening, when I finished everything I had to do and dragged my tired body up to the third floor, hiding in that dark corner to rest, I thought to myself. If he really met a wild boar one day, he would definitely be scared out of his wits!</p>
<p>During this period, my apprenticeship was hard and lonely. Especially in the evenings, the tailors all went outside after dinner. Everyone seemed to be able to find their place. For example, the clerk who collected accounts went to the coffee shop on the back street every night, mingled with those Hainanese people, and talked wildly until it was time to sleep before coming back. I was not allowed to leave: and I was not allowed to close the store door until half past nine. So, I often sat blankly at the store door, looking at the lonely street. The Javanese in the barbershop across the street would sit at the door and play a Japanese-made six-stringed guitar when he was happy, or sing; the sound broke through the monotony of the street. Following this singing, from time to time, a middle-aged man would come to our house, always sitting on the chair next to the tailor's table with his thin body, not saying much. He seemed to have a good relationship with the boss, and they would talk non-stop until it was time to close the door.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kapitan," I turned my head and said to him. My Amoy dialect was not very good. I tried my best to speak to the extent that he could understand: "The boss has gone out." I pointed to the street outside, and at this moment a carriage was passing by.</p>

<p>Like a heavily loaded camel, traveling in the desert.</p>
<p>My heart longs for a green millet, but there is no mirage of an oasis in sight.</p>
<p>Like a sturdy whip, held in the hand of the Creator.</p>
<p>It whips my heart day and night, making my heart hurt and sad.</p>

<p>— Hu Xu</p>
<p>Like me, my friend Li, who is down on his luck in a foreign land, sent me a letter this morning, telling me: "Yesterday at dusk, our daughter came out of her mother's womb, covered in blood, into this chaotic world! Now, both the big and the small are safe; but because we have no money, we didn't even prepare clothes for the child beforehand, so our poor child is still lying naked in the tattered quilt as I write this letter. Can you find a way to get some money to save our child!"</p>
<p>Money, I felt in my pocket and there were only twenty-six copper coins left, which is the money for today's meal. "That's it," I calculated in my heart. People with no money have to be pathetic; "I'll go get some children's clothes for him."</p>
<p>I lowered my head and walked out of my own dwelling. Avenue Joffre was long and smooth, the dull sky pressed on my head, and the wind was fanning around me, but my heart was almost scorching with heat.</p>
<p>At the intersection of Rue Luber, I found the residence of my fellow villager Su. Su and his wife were happily dressing their two-year-old little angel in exquisite and gorgeous new clothes in the delicate bedroom. When they saw me, they greeted me as if to confirm the joy in their hearts.</p>
<p>"Come and see how beautiful our child is?"</p>
<p>I nodded blankly, and then said in a tone that surprised them:</p>
<p>"I want to ask you for a favor!"</p>
<p>"What do you want?" the man asked.</p>
<p>"Can you give me a few of the clothes that your child wore when he was first born?"</p>
<p>"Did you have a child?" the woman said jokingly, which made my fellow villager Su, who was staring with doubtful eyes, laugh too.</p>
<p>"No," I said, "It's a poor friend of mine."</p>
<p>"Sure," the man said generously to his wife; "Go get a few for me."</p>
<p>Waiting, red and green children's clothes were handed over from the wardrobe, from the hands of the female benefactor, one piece, two pieces... "Here are ten pieces," the woman said, "They are still very new, but don't forget the red eggs."</p>
<p>What senseless words. If I could afford to send red eggs, what would I be worried about children's clothes! But I certainly thought it was unnecessary to explain to them; this was enough for me to be grateful for. I said goodbye with a thousand thanks, and I felt much lighter! The dull sky was far away from me, the wind brought a pleasant breath, and every street was bustling with happy people.</p>
<p>Route Tenant de la Tour passed under my excited steps; I arrived, the narrow kitchen where my friend Li lived arrived. Li's back was to the door, bending over to the old woman lying on the pit! His wife seemed to be discussing something.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lao Wu is here!"</p>
<p>The first to see me were the woman's two absent-minded eyes, followed by my friend Li's face, which was always depressed, turning around.</p>
<p>"A Wu!"</p>
<p>We shook hands, and the boiling hot blood was exchanged in each other's palms. My sight shifted from his face to the pit;</p>
<p>"How is she?"</p>
<p>"Still - good." She spoke slowly and weakly, followed by a aggrieved smile on the corners of her anemic mouth.</p>
<p>"I've already got the child's clothes." I opened the clothing bag; "Ten pieces in total, a fellow villager of mine gave them to me, and they are still 90% new."</p>
<p>The air flowed in the narrow kitchen.</p>
<p>"Take it, put it in the quilt to warm it up, and then you can put it on her. Lao Wu," she was happy; "Come and see the child!"</p>
<p>I could see clearly that there was a skinned frog in the tattered quilt!</p>
<p>"I have to go back," I said, "I'll try to get some money in a few days."</p>
<p>"It's best to get it before the end of the month, because the rent has already been asked for four times." the man said, there was no politeness between us.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>I answered anxiously, dragging my heavy shackles as if I were leaving them, and the dull sky pressed on my head again! ...</p>
<h3 id="e229">Dance Marathon (7) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— (Written by American LT Earl) Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>After resting for some time, Tax joined other dance "Marathons," which became his profession. He obtained a translation of "Yes, We Have No Bananas" in Greek, and practiced the song. This song and his special dance later became very famous. The audience who liked this kind of song and dance gradually increased, and he could earn ten to fifteen dollars a day in extra money. Even if he had to withdraw from the "Marathon" on the field sometimes, when he withdrew, his pockets were still full of money. When he had a large batch of savings in the bank, he couldn't help but have the idea of returning to his hometown, just like a rich American. He is now a celebrity in this new world. He was entertained by famous Greek compatriots, and his photo was even placed on top of short articles in Greek newspapers.</p>
<p>Tax participated in a total of sixteen dance "Marathons." He received the top prize eight times, and he also won the "Super Marathon" trophy worth one thousand yuan. Only the winners of other "Marathons" could participate in this "Marathon," and there was no rest period during the dance. He now had five thousand yuan in savings, enough for him to return to his hometown, so he returned to Greece. However, the hard work of the previous "Marathons" had damaged his lungs, and he was suffering from tuberculosis. Several sanatoriums were opened in the mountains of his Greek hometown. When he returned to Greece, he had to become a patient in one of them. He lived there with rotten lungs, and the money he earned in the United States was just enough to cover his expenses. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e230">Banning Coeducation <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>The issue of coeducation was once a major issue of contention in Chinese education and in society as a whole. Now, this issue seems to have come to an end, but now some people are trying to overturn this old case. According to reports, Peiping has decided to implement single-sex schools for middle schools and strictly prohibit coeducation from the 24th year of the Republic onwards. This issue has now been excavated from the old papers and placed before us again.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of coeducation, there is actually nothing worth discussing in the content. In the eyes of those who consider themselves responsible for maintaining morality, this is nothing more than telling women that they must eventually return silently to the family - no, back to the cage of man-eating etiquette. This is not at all harsh. Upon careful examination of the hearts and minds of those who consider themselves responsible for maintaining morality, they believe that coeducation is the system that is most likely to destroy social morality and make the "order" of society even more difficult to maintain (because, in addition to men, a group of unsettled people has been added). As a result, no one is responsible for the old etiquette. In this way, we, who bear the responsibility of maintaining morality, cannot but rise up and pay attention to the issue of coeducation. Making women leave society, return to the family, and return to the tomb of old etiquette will surely make society much more peaceful.</p>
<p>There are many places around us where the many pains and oppressions should be discussed, but these will not be of any interest to those who bear the responsibility of maintaining morality. The extreme sharpening of social economy does not feel like a very cruel thing to them at all. They now seem to be focused on the issue of so-called morality. The cries from hell will immediately turn into a gentle breeze when they fly to their ears. On the contrary, they have not relaxed their efforts to maintain morality for a moment, which is truly admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Driving the Yellow Ducks <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>As the morning sun first rises, the morning mist shyly dissipates; wisps of smoke already curl above the rooftops of many homes in Bright Moon Bay, enveloping this small fishing village in a haze, leaving only a blurred outline of the entire village. Besides the crowing of roosters, there are also the cries and fussing of children in the village; thus, the quiet air is suddenly filled with noise and bustle. The riverbank in front of the village is completely crowded with women washing rice and vegetables, their conversations and laughter noisily blending into one.</p>
<p>At this time, Old Fourth Yellow Duck had habitually slipped off the hard plank bed, let out a heavy cough, and dragged a damp smoking pipe towards the outhouse in the open space behind the house to relieve himself.</p>
<p>Returning, he wiped his face and saw that his wife had already cooked the leftover rice from the previous night into porridge, so he picked out a thicker piece of rice crust and took a big bowl—</p>
<p>After eating breakfast, he routinely went to the duck shed, opened the door; one, two, three... he counted the yellow ducks coming out of their nests, checking for any accidents, or perhaps signs of disease? Once all the yellow ducks had left the shed and gathered in the open space in the yard, vying to eat the wheat bran soaked in water, he carried a bamboo basket, squatted down, and reached one hand into the warm duck shed, feeling for white-shelled and greenish-shelled duck eggs, gently placing them in the basket. A stench of duck droppings drilled straight into his nostrils, but this was unavoidable for Old Fourth Yellow Duck.</p>
<p>One, two, three... ten... fifteen... twenty... thirty... thirty-one; he counted the eggs in the basket, there were thirty-one. He thought: thirty-one would have been worth a dollar in the early years when foreign goods were cheap and eggs were expensive: but, but, now they are one cent each, you'd need a hundred for a dollar, so thirty-one are only worth thirty cents or so. If each duck lays an average of one hundred eggs, then each duck makes only a dollar a year. If you calculate with fifty ducks (assuming nothing unexpected happens), you only make fifty dollars of income. How can fifty dollars be enough to support my family? Besides, the ducks still need to eat!</p>
<p>His wife walked over and took the egg basket.</p>
<p>"Be careful not to break them; there are thirty-one here!" He solemnly handed her the egg basket.</p>
<p>"Now we have more than a hundred eggs at home. You should take them to exchange for some rice! The rice has long been used up, and we should return the two sheng of rice we borrowed from Auntie San." She nagged at him.</p>
<p>"Oh!" He seemed indifferent as he answered and shouldered a herding pole, heading towards the river beach. When those yellow ducks saw the pole with a broken banana leaf fan hanging on the end, they climbed from the riverbank into the river, floating on the water.</p>
<p>The small boat gradually moved towards the corner of the bay: Old Fourth Yellow Duck stood at the bow of the boat with the herding pole across his shoulders, directing the duck flock on one hand and checking the riverbank on the other. The duck flock leisurely paddled on the water, following the direction of the herding pole, "Quack! Quack!" as they searched for small fish and shrimp in the river to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>The sun slowly climbed from the east to the center of the sky, and all the fishing boats on the river returned one by one for lunch; the ducks' bellies were probably full, but Old Fourth Yellow Duck's stomach was rumbling, so he also herded the flock of ducks back for lunch. In the afternoon, he released them again until the sun hid behind the mountains, then he blocked their path with the herding pole, letting the ducks pass under the pole; one, two, three... he counted them like that.</p>
<p>Old Fourth Yellow Duck had been herding yellow ducks for more than ten years. Whether it was spring, summer, autumn, winter, or even on days with drizzling rain, his life was always on the river: except during wind, rain, ice, and snow, when he had to feed these ducks more than ten catties of bean dregs or bran, which was really difficult to manage. So he would start to worry whenever he encountered this kind of weather.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Crossing White Wave Shoal <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Qi</p>
<p>——Random Notes on Returning South——</p>
<p>About half a li of water remained to reach White Wave Shoal when the boat docked by the dike. The boatman said it was time to ascend the shoal. Seven or eight towline pullers were already waiting on the dike. These pullers were all from mountain villages near White Wave Shoal, and they made a living pulling towlines year-round. Without these towline haulers, boats could not pass the shoal. According to the boatman, they were also divided into gangs. Each boat had a fixed employer, and they could not arbitrarily hire from other gangs. Usually, when the water level was low, boatmen only needed to pay one and a half or two dollars to tow the boat across the shoal; if the water was high, the price would increase to three or four dollars, all according to established rules.</p>
<p>The water at White Wave Shoal was treacherous, with turbulent waves and many hidden reefs, with only a winding waterway in the middle that was barely passable for boats. Boatmen on the Meijiang River felt anxious and fearful when they reached this point, considering it a matter of life and death. Therefore, passengers often preferred to disembark here, both to reduce the load and to avoid any possible danger.</p>
<p>It was noon, and I had been cooped up in the small cabin for half a day's journey, feeling extremely bored. Hearing that the boat was about to ascend the shoal, I suddenly thought it would be interesting to take the opportunity to go ashore and help them pull the towline. So, I quickly rummaged through my silk basket for my sneakers, stepped out of the boat, and explained to the boatman with a smile that I was going to help everyone pull the towline.</p>
<p>—It's very strenuous, sir. Anyway, the boat is lightly loaded, so it doesn't matter if you stay in the cabin. And the sun is very strong.</p>
<p>The boatman gave me a kindly wry smile, implying that I was someone who wouldn't even find it easy to walk a little in the sun.</p>
<p>—It doesn't matter! Just lend me a bamboo hat. Don't think of me as a weakling, I grew up in the countryside!</p>
<p>They laughed loudly and immediately grabbed a bamboo hat for me. Including the towline pullers and boatmen, there were twelve of us in total. After securing the towline, we stepped forward one by one, dragging the boat far behind us on the water, advancing towards the turbulent waves of the shoal.</p>
<p>The midday sun in June was like a ball of fire scorching our heads, and our bodies were drenched in sweat. When we dragged the boat to a cliff, the path suddenly became steep and narrow; the boat was close to the head of the shoal, and the water was becoming more rapid. The roar of the waves was like ten thousand horses galloping, and the towline on our shoulders was pulled even tighter; our feet felt like they were floating on the sand, never quite finding solid ground, and our steps gradually became heavy and sluggish. Perhaps fearing that I was overexerting myself, they shouted while gasping for air.</p>
<p>—Sir, put it down, the road is dangerous: falling would be no joke!</p>
<p>The road was indeed narrow and dangerous, and below the cliff was the turbulent stream of the shoal! But I wasn't afraid, my heart was surged with a tragic and excited blood! Looking at the surging, roaring stream, sweat flowed on my face, back, and hands! Forgetting my exhaustion, forgetting the danger, as if I had forgotten something, I suddenly remembered the movie "Volga River Comes." Looking back at the bent backs and ragged clothes of the towline haulers and boatmen on White Wave Shoal, I felt that they all shared the same poor existence and fate as the Volga boatmen! My heart felt weighed down, and I felt an infinite sadness rise within me. So, I gasped for air and opened my throat to sing the tragic and desolate boatmen's song.</p>
<p>This caused them to laugh comically. Of course, they wouldn't understand my feelings and thoughts at this moment; nor would they understand the meaning of this song. One of the boatmen asked.</p>
<p>—Sir, you're working hard, both towing and singing. What song are you singing? It sounds quite good.</p>
<p>—Sounds good? Eh?…….</p>
<p>The sun scorched their heads, and sweat flowed on their faces, backs, and bodies. They, understanding or not, didn't say a word, panting for breath, step by step, dragging their thick legs.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Death on the Road <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>That morning, as usual, it was gloomy. I went downstairs, and they were talking about a passenger who had fallen to his death at the wharf. The wharf wasn't far from where I lived, and I had nothing to do anyway, so naturally I wanted to go take a look. The streets of the small town were muddy in the morning; a thin mist shrouded the river in a pale color. The early morning steamship had already departed, but the wharf was still unusually bustling, with a circle of people gathered, their voices floating with noise. From the crowd, I saw a middle-aged man lying stiffly on the cold, wet cobblestones. He was already stiff and cold. A paper umbrella and a white package lay beside him, and his withered, straight arm still seemed to be reluctantly clutching at them. His face, as wooden as dead ashes, seemed to have much more to say; even if he could speak, who would he tell? All around were faces filled with curiosity and gloating, and the occasional shallow sigh was quickly covered by the hubbub of conversation and banter. Only the stiff man lay there painfully. A woman with disheveled hair, as if she had seen enough, said sympathetically to the people next to her: "Judging by his appearance, he's still in his thirties, wearing a silk cotton robe, not like someone from a poor family. To die like this in a foreign land, not even his family knows. Where is he from?"</p>
<p>The old man who sold morning snacks had witnessed this tragedy. He was there, telling others in a rambling manner: "This man was trying to catch the Deqing ferry. Just as it was getting light, he hurried out of the alley with his package, and his foot slipped somehow, and he fell down. But it wasn't a stroke, how could a man so young have a stroke? Someone saw it at the time, and there were other passengers who saw him lying on the ground struggling, his face turning ugly, his breath fading; who dared to help him? Someone without a name or background, if you kindly helped him home and he ended up dying, you wouldn't be able to get out of it! If he died, they would say you murdered him. He died painfully within minutes, but no one was willing to help him. This matter can only be settled by the local bailiff..." - In order to avoid getting involved, no one was willing to lend a hand to a dying passenger, leaving him to die on the road. Who can say there is any compassion in this world?</p>
<p>Although everyone used shallow conversation and laughter to throw at the lying corpse, there were still some kind-hearted people who found out where this man came from. In a small town, the mouth is the best news spreader. A fur trader recognized this man as his customer. The man's surname was Xia, from Deqing, and he was in the fur business. This time, he came to purchase sheepskins and earned more than a hundred dollars. Last night, he was drinking and playing cards with others. This morning, he wanted to go back to Deqing. Perhaps his family, young and old, were hoping he would bring money back for the winter, but who would have thought he would die on the road! The woman and children at home, who are working for a living, are still waiting for him with hopeful smiles. Shouldn't someone go and notify them? A fur trader's assistant went to make a long-distance phone call. The crowd of onlookers gathered even more. Someone found two reed mats to cover the man, to avoid obstructing traffic.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the man's family came. Seeing this tragic scene, the woman burst into tears. The crying moved many people even more. A white-skinned coffin was placed beside him. But they still wouldn't let the body be quietly placed in the coffin. It was said that those bailiffs who were supposed to be helping to watch over the body were asking them for money to provide a written guarantee. The woman had no choice but to leave the body lying on the road, with tears in her eyes, and was forced to go to several places to beg for help!</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Baoyu Cries at the Spirit"</p>
<p>The most amorous is ultimately the most foolish. Ill-fated beauty has been said since ancient times. It is lamentable that after the beautiful girl's soul departs, spring never arrives at the Xiang River. The Prince of Joyful Red cannot exhaust his feelings, crying before the spirit to show his sincerity. Only see the grass and trees wither, the sound silent, a desolate scene everywhere. The parrot does not know the affairs of the heart, murmuring poems about burying flowers. Seeing the saddle, one must think of the horse. Seeing the object, how can one not think of the person? Sister, I call you peerless talent now has vanished. Empty left belongings before. Just want to accompany you often. Who knows all things are determined by heaven, not by man. Pitiful that you have suffered so much since childhood. Pitiful that you hold resentment and go to the underworld. Thinking back to when we played together as children. Today, ear temples worn can not. Thinking back to when we admired the moon and flowers together and wrote poetry. Today, singing wildly and writing can not. Thinking back to when our hearts were connected and we were so close. Today, shadows can not. Thinking back to you often laugh infinite good. Today, the desire to see look can not. I now often tell before the spirit. Do you know in the nether? Sorrowful. Tears falling. Like drunk like fool want soul break. This is really wealth and glory as spring dream. Life gathering and parting equal autumn cloud. To do not know jump out of trouble place. From now on cut off this unfulfilled feeling. Be a carefree worldly person.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shen Bao Local Edition, Film Special</p>
<h3 id="e237">Farewell to All Readers of This Publication <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Min</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, May 1st, this publication will temporarily separate from the readers of this newspaper. Therefore, in my position as editor, I must say a few words of farewell to all readers of this newspaper, especially to those friends who have supported this publication.</p>
<p>The farewell words I speak contain many endless meanings. Although the Shen Bao Film Special Publication is now suspended, it can only be said to be the end of a chapter, and cannot be said to be discontinued, because we cannot judge matters solely on the basis of form. This so-called fixed position of the Film Special Publication, the one hundred and twenty square inches next to the newspaper's masthead, although temporarily eliminated in form, texts about film can still be published in other locations. Therefore, although the form is gone, the substance may still exist.</p>
<p>As for the reasons why the Film Special Publication is being suspended, this concerns the administration of the newspaper office, which is difficult to express in a few words here. What I can say here is that during this suspension period, we can observe whether members of society, general readers, and those related to the film industry and art feel that a publication like the Shen Bao Film Special Publication is indeed needed and whether it is beneficial to them.</p>
<p>Of course, there are those who express their need explicitly, and those who tacitly approve without expressing it. I personally believe that if the Film Special Publication is needed, it mostly belongs to the latter category, because for thousands of years, the teaching of "contentment in poverty and happiness in abandonment" has long told us that if there is something to eat... we eat it... if there is nothing to eat... we don't snatch it. In this way, even if the Shen Bao Film Special Publication is indeed needed (I personally do not make a definite statement here), I believe that they may not feel it is a must-read during the suspension.</p>
<p>Therefore, the length of the publication's suspension also depends on whether the need for such a publication is very clear and urgent.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Film Special Publication has been published since November of the 21st year, which is now two and a half years. During these thirty months, this publication, under the guiding principle of "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault," has managed to contribute a little effort. On the part of the editor, I have never dared to assume the position of an advocate of film culture and art. What I have achieved is to provide readers with an interesting publication about film art, while at the same time giving them some general knowledge about film art and some life lessons learned from the lives and experiences of people in the film industry.</p>
<p>It is true that this publication has also published promotional texts from time to time, but these are all promotions of an obligatory nature, definitely not being used by others or having personal intentions. Furthermore, these short promotional texts are based on interest and facts. And this is very convenient in terms of editing and arrangement.</p>
<p>As for the editing aspect, I have received the assistance of many gentlemen during these two and a half years, especially Mr. Ling He. He has been working diligently until today. He is someone who has been with the Shen Bao Film Special Publication from beginning to end. His spirit deserves the admiration of all readers. The editor of this publication would like to express his gratitude to Mr. Ling and all the other gentlemen who have helped me.</p>
<p>Finally, I should apologize to the readers of this newspaper and the supporters of this publication, because during these two and a half years, I have received many letters from true friends, providing many useful suggestions. Some of these suggestions have been implemented, while others have not. But due to the editor's limited time, I have not been able to reply immediately, and I hope that everyone will understand this deeply. I have done my best to create a valuable, interesting, and just publication.</p>
<p>I would like to thank all of you readers for your constant support, constant encouragement.</p>
<p>I hope that you readers will support this newspaper with the same enthusiasm with which you support this publication, and I hope that this publication, whether in substance or even in form, will soon meet you again.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Review of "Adventures of a Wanderer" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Carnival——The Grand Shanghai's Reflection——</p>
<p>"Adventures of a Wanderer" is about a traveling puppeteer who faces various tragedies and comedies after his wife dies of illness, all for the sake of leaving behind his orphaned child. It's a play filled with paternal love and human warmth. However, it's a pity that the playwright didn't develop the story well around this theme, often using the subplots of supporting characters to replace some of the main character's inner performances.</p>
<p>The life of a person who makes a living performing puppet shows is already precarious and drifting, with more sadness than joy. How could he endure the pain of his wife's death? The author overlooked the dramatic aspects and instead arranged two close friends for the protagonist Zhike: the famous pickpocket Mike as his musician and the young Daisy as his puppeteering assistant. Thus, with Mike's help, Zhike steals his beloved son from the hospital where his wife's father had placed him for adoption and flees to another location to wander. If the story had continued along this path, there would have been plenty of drama to be made between a single wanderer and his young son. However, the playwright has Zhike return with his son two years later, where he meets Daisy and others, who have become a good nanny for Zhike's blood.</p>
<p>Naturally, if it continues this way, the play will only develop from the romantic aspect between Zhike and Daisy, which is inevitably too monotonous. Therefore, the playwright pulls the play into a lively background. The World Centennial Celebration has opened, and in the grand occasion of various performances, there is a children's competition. Mike uses a little trick to swap the election tickets, and Zhike's child actually wins the first prize. As a result, the case is solved, the child is lost, and a fire breaks out in the amusement park, all these exciting scenes come together. In the end, Daisy saves the child, and Zhike gratefully holds a prison-themed wedding with her. After serving six months, they can finally enjoy the happiness of being a son, husband, and wife.</p>
<p>Such a disorganized play is inevitably dull, so it can only hope to be adjusted with lighthearted gags and intense stimulation. Here, a nurse secretly kisses Mike, who came to steal a child, due to a romantic appointment with a doctor. Mike's humorous stealing everywhere, chasing women in the amusement park and getting slapped, as well as the troupe from "selling savage heads" including fat women, Japanese people, and women with beards, and the chaotic scenes of fire and capture. Unfortunately, the excitement and fun ultimately cannot cover up the emptiness of the content. The traces of artificiality and coincidence seem to be attempts to conceal the obvious.</p>
<p>Director Walter Lang's overall sensitivity is commendable, but he failed to use concise and clear editing to remedy the disorganized parts. Several turbulent multi-person scenes were handled better than scenes with fewer people but more drama.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Li Tuo, is used to acting in fast-paced dramas with lots of action. In this "Adventures of a Wanderer," which is full of worldly flavor and requires inner performance, he works very hard, but unfortunately, he did not achieve the best results. The big-nosed Jikesen's achievement here lies not in making people laugh with humor, but in grasping the personality of the character Mike in a fairly thorough and profound way.</p>
<p>The actress playing Daisy has a character that is too vague in the play. It is not clear why she loves Zhike and why she can't express this point, so her performance is flat and undeveloped.</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Pasqua listened to Antonio's words and knew that he was also fascinated by Kanga. He felt he should fulfill his duty as a friend, so he told Antonio everything about his relationship with Kanga, as well as Kanga's actions, to the fullest extent. After Antonio heard his words, he was filled with righteous indignation and vowed to Pasqua that after seeing her once, he would humiliate her thoroughly before ceasing all contact with her.</p>
<p>But Kanga's methods were truly amazing. After Antonio met her, he had already fallen deeply in love, irrevocably so, and the anger he originally felt in his heart had vanished like smoke. But strangely, Kanga also developed genuine feelings for Antonio, for the first time in her life. But her happiness was not long-lasting, because Pasqua soon learned about their affection for each other.</p>
<p>Although he hated Kanga, he could not bear the fact that his original position had now been taken by someone else. Although he knew Kanga's methods were despicable, his love had not completely died, but was instead stirred up by Antonio's new love, to an unstoppable degree.</p>
<p>He demanded a duel with Antonio, and his demand was resolutely accepted by Antonio.</p>
<p>That night, Kanga pleaded with Antonio, urging him to flee the country and take her with him. But Antonio said that he did not have a passport and could not cross the border.</p>
<p>The next morning, Pasqua and Antonio arrived at the dueling location as scheduled. Kanga also came. Her face was ashen and her body was trembling. She did not hesitate to beg Pasqua for mercy. She told him that she truly loved Antonio and begged him not to duel. But Pasqua did not say a word, and the preparations for the duel proceeded as before. When he held the gun, turned around to shoot from a distance, a kind of unfathomable, miserable smile appeared on his face. He pulled the trigger, but he deliberately fired into the sky.</p>
<p>Antonio, however, believed that Pasqua was going to kill him, so he aimed at Pasqua's head and fired. Pasqua did not die, but was injured in the eyes and went blind. At the same time, the police arrived. Pasqua was taken to the hospital, and Antonio was arrested because he did not escape.</p>
<p>Kanga, for the sake of Antonio's life, remembered to be in danger, so she went to see Governor Basquito. She used all her seductive skills to try to get him to agree to release Antonio. At the same time, she managed to get two passports, telling the governor that the two passports were for her and a cousin to go abroad. The governor also believed it to be true and did not investigate further.</p>
<p>Soon, the two of them had reached the border. Kanga couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. She tightly held Antonio's arm, and her face was as pale as velvet. Antonio, on the other hand, was elated... He had gained freedom and the love of a beautiful woman, and now he was setting foot in a foreign country, like lovebirds, their joy was unparalleled. But as the train shook and was about to depart, Kanga quietly jumped down, leaving Antonio to go alone.</p>
<p>The train had left, and Antonio was shouting desperately, but Kanga only pointed her hand, shaking her head, her eyes filled with tears, and her heart was about to break. She knew that if she followed Antonio abroad, she would not be able to have peace of mind for a moment, nor enjoy happiness for a moment. She felt that there was only one way: ...that was to return to Pasqua's side. He needed her. She should confess all her sins to him. She decided to devote her future years to repaying her past mistakes. (The End)</p>

<p>— Liu Jipiao</p>
<p>C. (Patient Department)</p>
<p>Wards are divided into men's, women's, children's, maternity, and newborn infant rooms. In addition, there are public wards and private wards.</p>
<p>(1) Public Wards - Modern wards are smaller than in the past. Each room accommodates approximately eight to twelve beds. There is now a trend to further reduce this to four to two beds. A room accommodating eight beds can measure 22 ft x 42 ft. A room accommodating two beds can measure 16 ft x 16 ft. The size of the ward is determined by the volume of space that each person should occupy, i.e., each person should occupy at least 1,000 cubic feet. A center-to-center distance of eight feet between beds is appropriate. The beds can be separated by screens. A ceiling height of 10 ft 6 in is suitable. The window should ideally be one foot wide. The windowsill should be two feet six inches from the floor, with the top edge half a foot from the ceiling. The corridor width can be eight to ten feet.</p>
<p>The light entering the ward should not directly face the patient's eyes. The best direction is for the head and the wall between the two windows to form a right angle.</p>
<p>In addition to public wards, there should also be small wards for patients with infectious diseases, and a quiet room should be set up next to them for patients who are afraid of being disturbed or who can disturb other patients. The location should be near the nursing station.</p>
<p>(2) Private Wards - The size and shape of private wards should be such that patients do not feel depressed when they see them. Space should be left for tables and chairs in addition to the bed, so 10 ft x 16 ft, 14 ft x 16 ft, or 12 ft x 18 ft are appropriate. A washroom and toilet should be provided nearby.</p>
<p>(3) Children's Wards - The upper part of the partitions in children's wards should be fitted with glass for easy supervision. The inside of the corridor should also be fitted with glass. The room should be painted with pictures for decoration to provide comfort to the children.</p>
<p>(4) Maternity Wards - There should be an entrance hall leading to the delivery room (at least 12 ft x 16 ft). There should be a sterilization room and a utility room. The nursery should have at least one hour of sunlight every day and good natural ventilation. In terms of area, if the maternity bed area is 30 and each child requires a space of 200 to 300 cubic feet, then the area should be 3 x 23. The temperature should be maintained at 80F. For soundproofing purposes, it is best to separate it from the corridor with a vestibule. A dining room should be set up nearby for the diet of the mothers and children. There should also be a small nursery for infants with infectious diseases.</p>
<p>D. (Operating Department) is usually located on the upper floors because of its abundant light. However, some are also located on the first floor, in which case large windows are used. The most important part of the operating department is the main operating room, approximately 18 ft x 24 ft, and the secondary operating room, approximately 14 ft x 16 ft. The ceiling should not be lower than 12 ft to ensure adequate space. The width of the window should be eight feet. The windowsill should be two feet six inches high, reaching directly to the ceiling. The window should have light-shielding equipment because sunlight is sometimes not allowed to enter. A strong electric light is installed on the operating table. The configuration of the light should be such that there are no shadows. The interior color is best to use gray-green ceramic tiles to protect the walls, which are then painted with light gray-green. The floor is paved with dark gray-green tiles, but the tile surface should not be too slippery. Modern operating rooms often have a student viewing area. This area is located on the upper floor of the operating room, only seven feet above the floor. There are saddles all around. Students can lean over the glass screen and look at the operating table. Their line of sight is directed in from the edge of the short wall in front of them so that people below will not notice.</p>
<p>Next to each operating room, there should be a sterilization room and a doctor's washroom. In addition, the attached parts include an anesthesia room, a nurses' work room, a small laboratory, a doctor's rest room, a changing room, a toilet, etc. The anesthesia room should be approximately 12 ft x 16 ft, and the walls should be set with warm colors.</p>

<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>(4) Copperization - The pure copper obtained after melting can be placed in a copperization device, with a small amount of sand and raw copper ore added, and air is injected into the liquid at a pressure of 16 pounds per square inch. Then the sulfurous substance is transformed into sulfur dioxide, and iron sulfide can also be transformed into iron oxide and combined with sand to form slag. Stop working and take out the slag. Then absorb air to remove the sulfur in the copper sulfide, and then pure copper can be obtained.</p>
<p>(5) Refining - Although pure copper has been obtained after copperization, it still needs to be refined. The method can use electricity. For electric refining, the electrodes can be arranged in parallel or in series. The solution used is copper sulfate and a small amount of sulfuric acid mixture. The electricity used should be low voltage and high current, and the current density should be 25 amperes per square foot of electrode. After electric refining, the copper block of the anode is oxidized into Cu, passes through the solution and adheres to the cathode, thus obtaining truly clean copper.</p>
<p>Section 3 Characteristics and Uses of Copper</p>
<p>Copper is soft and easy to stretch, and its color is slightly reddish. The maximum resistance of raw copper is 25,000 pounds per square inch. The proportional limit is 8,000 pounds per square inch, and the elongation reaches 7%. For those who use fast cooling, the maximum resistance is 40,000 pounds per square inch, and the elongation is 3%. The use of copper in the construction industry, such as electric wires, window decorations, or the manufacture of various alloys, is widely used.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 Aluminum</p>
<p>Section 1 Overview of Aluminum</p>
<p>Looking at the history of aluminum, before 1850, it was still a rare metal mineral, only enough for museum exhibitions. It was not until 1889 that there was a market for trading. It was first discovered in 1825 by Osterd. At that time, the value was very expensive, such as one hundred and twenty or thirty gold yuan per pound. Nowadays, it only costs one or two jiao of gold, because the traces of aluminum are all over the earth. According to scientists' exploration, about 8% of the earth's crust is aluminum, while iron is only 5%, so the reserves of aluminum are richer than those of pig iron. However, aluminum does not have a simple mineral vein, and is mostly mixed with other minerals, so it must be smelted to obtain aluminum. The most common mineral vein is aluminum oxide, called Bauxite in the West. The impurities it contains include iron oxide sand silicon, etc., which should be purified during smelting.</p>
<p>Section 2 Smelting of Aluminum</p>
<p>The smelting of aluminum is usually done with electricity in order to meet the needs of large-scale production and supply, and to reduce costs. Moreover, without electricity, aluminum cannot be extracted purely. The commonly used aluminum smelting methods include the Bayer method and the Hall method. They are described separately below. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>Regarding the usage on the construction site:</p>
<p>Green Bean Sand - In general, reinforced concrete construction projects, the components of cement, yellow sand, and gravel are indispensable. Therefore, in the era when the modern construction industry is booming, the output of cement, yellow sand, and gravel occupies the most important position. But what exactly is this green bean sand (Gravel)? It is a kind of small stone chip, with properties similar to fly ash. However, its use is not needed for mixing cement for large materials and pillars, etc., because it is not easily subjected to tensile and compressive forces. However, it is extremely important in places such as window sills or chimney caps (Channel Cap).</p>
<p>Sun Step! The arrangement of a staircase sometimes becomes several sections of curves in the middle due to the position. In the curved areas, the treads (Step) are difficult to inlay as a whole. They are probably made into long triangles. These long triangular treads are called sun steps (Winding).</p>
<p>Air Vent - An air vent is a kind of ventilation equipment, mostly small square or rectangular iron bars left around the outside wall of the floor joist wall. This is an air vent (Ventilator). However, ordinary street houses rarely use air vents. In more elaborate small foreign-style houses, there must be floor joists in their construction, so air vents are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Plumb Bob - (Plumb) A kind of thing that can be used to observe the inclination of the wall (that is, the so-called "rush" and "exemption"). The shape is like a pig's heart and liver, hanging from a line at the top. To use it, hold the upper end of the plumb line with the first thumb and second finger of your right hand, and gently press the remaining three fingers on the wall. The plumb bob itself has weight. It should be at least two or three points away from the wall. At this time, use your eyes to aim, and you can see the "rush" and "exemption" of the wall on the straightness of the line. Therefore, the use of this plumb bob should be commonly prepared by everyone on the construction site, from the supervisor to the worker.</p>
<p>Worker! In the construction site, whether it is a plasterer or a carpenter, all those who are working are called workers (WordMan).</p>
<p>Dutou! The large ends (Lining) on both sides of the Shikumen and the outer wall corners (Angle) are probably at the position of the Xurlin, and another kind of Suzhou stone or other stone is inlaid. This kind of stone is called Dutou (Jamb).</p>
<p>Mountain Head! There are many names for walls, most of which are divided (calculated as ordinary city houses). The one built in the front is called the front veranda wall (or front eaves wall), the one built in the back is called the back veranda wall (or back eaves wall), the one built in the stove shed is called the back shed wall, and there is also a kind of front veranda wall and back veranda wall connected to the two side walls. The upper end follows the roof to form a two-sided slope, which is called the mountain head (Jamb). Its wall body is called the gable wall (Jamb Wail).</p>
