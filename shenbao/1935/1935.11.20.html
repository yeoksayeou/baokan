<h3 id="c10">工業用銀成色問題 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>自科學發達。化學工業之用銀日盛。我國之銀。以工業幼稚。所費於此中者尙少。故大宗用途。係供器皿首飾之原料。然銀器非富厚之家不備。銀飾則農家婦女亦不能無一二。簪環手鐲指戒之屬。固大衆化之婦女裝飾品也。今者政府爲現銀集中。嚴防偸漏。而對銀製品用銀。加以管理。固應有之舉也。惟限制嗣後祇可用化學銀。其必須攙用純銀者。又不得過百分之三十。則與原有銀樓業用銀含純銀量百分之八十八。大相懸殊。宜其有「純銀减少則過硬而無法製造。質不潔白。勢必無法營業」之呼籲矣。</p>
<p>中國古代。當園法發生劇變之候。未嘗不禁蓄銅。甚至並禁用銅器。或加以限制。蓋銅爲唯一之幣材也。此風至淸代猶然。銀雖早用爲交易工具。但以產微而得不易。故當賦稅改用折色。時人尙起而詬病。此雖農業社會之一現象亦可見得銀之不易。明季遣中使四出求銀。騷擾殊甚。自與西洋通商。銀之來源漸盛。淸初嚴海禁。番舶久不至。銀用大窘。卽雅片一役動機。殆亦因雅片入口。加速白銀外流。引起朝野注意。乃有肅淸烟毒之大舉。中國既缺銀。而歷代幣制又時有破壞。物價靡定民生不安。於是民間藏銀與重視硬幣之習慣。自然養成矣。</p>
<p>今民間猶不能脫離此等舊觀念。自銀幣不準使用。無識之徒。已相駭疑。若進而並首飾亦不許用成色較高之白銀。則必更滋誤會。且政府無非恐民間之白銀有所漏洩耳。要知銀幣與銀器較。則銀幣之走漏易而銀器難。盍不稍寬用銀成色之禁。加密管理稽查之方。凡屬銀器概禁携帶出洋。嗣後除首飾外。不得製銀爲器。卽如鼎層框盾壺巵盃盒之層。祇准以化學銀（或含純銀百分之三十）製造之。而仍准銀樓業維持其原有之成色。製作首飾。僅加密其稽查之方法。如此則民間不以爲不便。而銀之消費於銀器者亦屬有限。財部公布之銀製品用銀管理規則。既有工業用銀。呈經財政部特准。得不受第二條及第六條百分之三十之限制」等語。則工業用銀成色之高低。似不無變通之餘地也。</p>

<h3 id="c92">桂遊觀感 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 錢華</p>
<p>記老前次乘六學術國體在廣西南寗開會之便、南遊觀光、七月三十日由滬乘柯立芝總統輪啟程、八月三十日從香港坐林肯總統輪返滬、行期恰爲一個月、來回經過香港·廣州·三水、不過勾留二三天、十分之八的旅程都消磨在廣西省內、從商業中心的梧州、到政治中心的南寗、再往龍州、視察邊防設備、出鎭南關、越國境至安南諒山、再返南寗、轉往柳州、最后到文化中心的桂林、中灕江南下、經過陽朔·平樂·昭平、折返梧州、舟行凡五天、循桂省公路車行凡六天、往返曲折奔馳達萬餘里、廣西全省八大區中、除百色·天保外、都已到過、人家說是走馬看花、記者却把走馬變成飛車、幢幢黑影、飛掠而過、更談不到什麼觀感、不過就當地民衆的口述、普遍一般的現象、把參觀遊覽所得拿來作參證、綜合個人觀感所及、拉雜寫了下來、作爲這次桂遊的結束、</p>
<p>第一、桂省的廉潔政治、是從最高當局做起、上行下效埋頭苦幹、確値得欽佩、中國的政洽本來是很簡單的、祇要文官不貪錢、武官不怕死、便能政治淸明、天下太平、廣西當局認淸這點、躬自力行、一方面復從根本上竭力提倡節儉、嚴禁公務人員賭博·宿娼、和其他種種不良奢侈習慣、上自總司令·副總司令·主席·廳長、以至辦事員都一律穿灰色土布制服·制帽、和普通已衆絲毫沒有分別、省主席黃旭初、時常看見他在街上跑路、總司令李宗仁單騎在城　附近馳騁、更是極普通的事情、此種灰布制服二元半錢一套、有一位美國顧問也脫去了筆挺的高等呢絨西裝、穿着灰布洋服、逢人便說、又便宜、又舒服、足證風俗可以移轉心理、公務昌旣屏絕了一切不良的嗜好、個人生活自然便極端的簡單化、每月有一二百元薪水收入、足够開銷、自不至再冒萬險去幹那貪汚的事情、所謂釜底抽薪的辦法、廣西全省的官吏除了本身俸給以外、不敢妄取一文、殆亦儉而後能　耳、</p>
<p>第二、桂省的訓練民團、是從下層農民做起、事事脚踏實地、不求形式、澈底消除軍民隔膜的弊病、幹的精神、在民團的訓練和組織上有最充份的表現、鄕村的民團爲組織的基礎、鄕村長任民團預備隊大小隊長、兼任國民基礎學校校長、把軍事·行政·敎育·打成一片、鄕村長爲中學以上畢業生、受過嚴格的訓練、都是頭腦新頴之有爲靑年、絕對沒有土棍惡霜、拿着民團幌子欺壓良民的事實、談吐和藹可親、處處以誠懇態度指導鄕民、所以都能十分用命、了解團體合作、和公衆利益的意義、懶惰的變成勤儉、兇狠的化爲和善、從自衛·自治·推行到自給政策、廣西民團的成功、在最顯著事實方面來講、便是全省土匪的消滅、乞丐的銳减、和公路三萬餘里的完成、現在全省民團自衛的力量日益增厚、廣西在全國省份中軍隊的數量爲最少、僅有五偭師、但據軍事專家觀察、全省自衛的力量比較任何省份爲大、可以抵抗五十萬最新式軍隊的侵略、去年竄桂的共匪迅速撲滅、完全是民團的力量、許多人跑到廣西去參觀回來、都說廣西民團辦得確實不錯、但是大部份咸有一種懷疑、便是廣西訓練民團的辦法是否可以推行到其他各省、尤其是舒服慣了的江浙幾省比較富庶的民衆、因爲廣西地瘠民貧、人民習於勞苦、絕對的能服從指揮、祇要有領導人才、便可嚴密組織起來、爲公家効命、江浙諸省呢、情形恰巧相反、假使實施刻苦的訓練、要農民黎明奔馳數十里、集台受訓、平時再担守望工作、還要抽出工夫來耕公家田地、修築公路、施行之初、必定怨聲載道、頂替流亡的弊病層出不窮、土豪劣紳冉出而阻撓、困難重重確較桂省爲甚、但記者個人意見、認爲祇要領袖有决心、處處能以身作則、要謀求事實的改進、不要祇求表面化、則天下本無難事、民團能成功於廣西、而不能推行於其他各省、實在於理不通、於事亦必無也、</p>
<p>第三、從建設工作方面來講、現在廣西全省每年祗有二千七百餘萬元的收入、其中十分之六七還是靠特種過境稅、所以當局量入爲出、十分讜愼、大規模的建設事業、可謂絕無倣有、你要拿大都市繫華的眼光跑到廣西去、要看什麼幾十百萬的工廠物質設備、絕對非失望不可、此點正和廣東情形恰巧相反、在廣東有的是幾百萬元新設的工廠、便是中山紀念堂和市政府等宮殿式的建築也就化去了幾百萬元、但是有一點値得我們讚美的、廣西用在建設方面的錢、數量雖少、却非常經濟、用去一元錢、一般民衆便能享受這一元錢的利益、就記者所參覜到的地方、如家畜保育所、農業試騐塲、桐油製煉廠、衛生試騐所、民衆博物館等、都能直接與民衆接觸、用費不多、功效實廣、足以矯正我國侈談建設、浪擲金錢的毛病、</p>
<p>第四、關於西南邊防的設備、記者曾到龍州去看了一次、萬山重疊、關隘峻險、確有一夫當關萬軍莫進的天然的形勢、其時邊防督辦李品仙氏、現任第四集團軍總參謀長、蒞任三年、頗能振興邊務、多所改進、軍事民團的訓練、均有朝氣、邊境各重要關口防務、雖在承平日久的今日、初未有絲毫廢弛現象、中法兩國邊境商民往來絆商、和雙方軍事外交官員的聯歡、均能根據絕對平等原則、受了被欺壓慣的人、跑到邊疆呼吸着平等自由空氣、眞感覺到有說不出的愉快、現在龍州交通日益便利、每禮拜有三次航空班、從廣州飛到梧州·南寗·至龍州、不過一天功夫便可到了、其他復有公路水道、從前視爲神秘區域的龍州、於今各業興盛、逈不同前了、西南邊防區域一帶、崇山峻嶺、人口稀少、向多瘴疫、每値春夏之交、疫癘盛行、死亡枕籍、以是居民日减、地多荒蕪、邊疆區域不能發達者、其故在此、目下桂當局竭力注意衛生行政、認爲瘴疫是一種熱帶病瘧疾、分頭派員到四鄉注射預防、巳有相當成效、以後可進一步注意移民問題、龍州風景殊不亞桂林、當局倘能注意收拾、前途發展、正未可限量、我國對於邊防、向少注意、民國十八年、記者一度到東三省視察、西北至海拉爾滿洲里等處、邊防腐敗情形、觸目驚心、自九一八後、始稍稍引起國人的注意、但是班洪班弄都不淸楚、鬧成絕大笑話、西北西南均爲我國重要門戶、尤希望桂當局能繼續苦幹的精神、不以現在情形爲滿足、盡量注意邊防的鞏固、和邊疆人民農村經濟的發展、使我國抵抗外敵獲得首次勝利有歷史上無上光榮價値的鎭南關、與我民挨、永垂不朽、</p>

<h3 id="c104">浙建廳秘書汪英賓談　浙省棉業推廣經過　本年推廣棉田十二萬零七十餘畝改良棉種成效顯著明年將更擴充 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>申時社云、浙江省建設廳、年來對於各種建設事業、推進不遺餘力、公路之建築、錢江大橋之興工、使交通賴以溝通、近年注重農村之建設、如合作桌業之提倡、絲業棉業之改良、關於棉業改良之工作、均由該廳棉業管理處主辦、其主要工作、爲推廣改良棉種、以適應本國舫織之用、浙江十棉品質旣劣、織維太短、每年所產、祇能供給家常日用、去年始由省府撥巨欵、推廣良種、茲値棉植收銷結束時期、而該省改良頗有成效、並逢該省建廳秘書兼棉業管理處長汪英賓氏、因公過滬時、記者特往訪詢、爲述經過詳情如次、</p>
<p>推廣期中困難甚多</p>
<p>據汪氏云、浙省棉業推廣、自去歲方始大規模舉行、所幸今年收穫、尙稱滿意總計推廣改良棉田、共達十一萬零零七十四畝、以浙省地面論，範圍不謂不大、工作經過頗費週折、棉業花行、因爲傳統觀念所束、對於改良棉業、不無懷疑反對抵抗之行動、惟省廳對於改良棉種、巳有長時期之試騐、目的旣爲棉農謀利益、爲國家增生產、管理處祇得以全力致之，除對於事前訓練指導昌五十餘人、分配各實騐區實行指示勸導外、並將改良棉之優點、及歴史來試騐之結果、用簡明文字編成小冊分送以資宣傳、而利推廣、結果雖佳誤會亦多、棉農糾衆搗毀實試處事務所有之、痛駡侮辱指導員繼而用武者有之、利用地方報以文字攻擊者有之、惟管理處旣負改良農村之使命、不得不用種　方法、猛力推進、</p>
<p>阻撓改良共三方面</p>
<p>棉農方面阻撓之原因、在缺乏常識、貪圖小利、往常收花數量、隨意虛報、可圖减付租金、旣經政府主辦、必須實報、以此不願改種、或以改良棉品質雖優、在政府指導之下、難免有捐稅之徵收、因此　持保守、不圖改良花行方面阻撓之原因、在不能再向農民發高利貸靑苗放欵、一般農民、因往時貪圖有錢可借、有米可賒、對於花行、往往負倩甚大、若農民接受改良、則花行勢必向彼等逼債、故一般農民經花行之指示、羣起反對改良、冉言棉田地主方面、其棉田均假手於當地之土豪、爲之經租而此類人、又多爲花行之經理、於是散佈政府統制收員不利於棉田地主等流　、凡此種種‘均爲棉植改良之阻碍、</p>
<p>略生波折勸導即平</p>
<p>本處關於各種阻碭、在過去均能解决者、在能得各縣縣長台作、會同下鄉、婉言勸導、復蒙每紳紳士如虞洽老等、　旁贊助示、而各棉農始安心領籽播　然巳煞費苦心矣、</p>
<p>採購種籽分發播種</p>
<p>本處推行改良棉種、除百萬棉種、由浙江棉塲供給外、所有馴化美棉種籽、均由本人分赴鄭州各地採購、分發各種區播陣、採購之價頗大、雖蒙　道部當局、改削運費每担價値價在四元之譜、農民以價値一元之土花種、易改良種、故省政府對於種子損失、巳屬不貲、</p>
<p>推廣畝數及棉種區</p>
<p>推廣區域共分實施區六處合作棉田兩處、其推廣畝數、共計十二萬零零七四畝、內分百萬棉六萬三千一百八十一畝、馴化等棉、五萬六千八百九十三畝、各區支配情形、可分表如下、</p>
<p>區別　棉田畝數　棉種別</p>
<p>蕭山棉業改良實施區　二四、二四八　百萬棉</p>
<p>餘姚棉業改良實施區二九、五〇二石堰百萬棉　二三、六七　二畝　新浦沿馴化美棉五八三〇畝</p>
<p>杭縣棉業改良實施區一五、二六一百萬棉</p>
<p>鎭海棉業改良實施區二六、五二四馴化美棉</p>
<p>慈谿棉業改良實施區一九、六七八馴化美棉</p>
<p>海鹽棉業改良實施區三、一五〇馴化美棉</p>
<p>鄞縣合作棉田　一、二〇九馴化美棉</p>
<p>定海合作棉田　五〇二馴化美棉</p>
<p>改良棉種高出土棉</p>
<p>各區改良工作、均由本處派定指導昌分發各區指導、所有種植經過、均須按時報舌、茲從其統計觀之、知百萬棉及馴化美棉產量比較土棉均屬高出、其每畝產量之高出者、平均可達七八十斤、最少者亦高出在二三十斤、價格之平均、百萬棉及馴化棉亦均高出於土棉、由此統計、足見所施改良種籽已收相　效果、棉農至此、當可無言矣、改良棉與土棉、每畝產量及價格之比較、詳見下表、改良棉每畝產量及價格　土棉每忘恩負義產量及價格縣別最高最低平均價格　最高　最低　平均價格</p>

<p>鄞縣　一一〇　一一〇　一三〇　九、　八九　四二　七七　九、〇〇</p>
<p>實騐棉區　均告豐收</p>
<p>江氏言至此、記者因見日前報載全經會棉業統制會所發表之全國棉業產量統計、據云、浙省今年收成、祇有二成、因以舉詢、據汪氏云、所謂浙省今年收成祇有二成之說、恐有錯誤、即就本處改良棉田實騐區而言、雖非豐收、所得豈止二成、杭縣區因施肥過度、以致枝葉格外茂盛、加以雨水過多、致產量較他處爲弱、但此係特殊情形、若比較同地土棉之產量、仍高出一二十斤以上、若以全省產量統計、改良棉之收成、至少在五六成之間、土棉亦在四五成之譜、</p>

<p>雙方各逞雄辯一塲舌戰　庭諭下星期二下午宣判</p>
<p>曾任臨時法院兼七訴院院長現充律師之盧興原、與現爲鹽務稽核所帮辦之史志南（即史元愷），被巳故掛名法國國籍厦門人王堯臣（即王有裕）之妻歐陽舜英委任丘漢平律師、向第一特區地方法院以刑事目訴與王妾杜瑞珍在盧之事務所僞造遺囑、冒充王堯臣簽字請求依法懲治、該案開審後、盧興原除聯合史　南對歐陽舜英提起反訴、請</p>
<p>治誣吿</p>
<p>罪外、盧復單獨對丘漢平律師提起誣吿·教唆誣吿·及妨害名譽·之刑訴、業經第一特院吳則韓推事一度傳盧到案審問、巳誌前報、昨日午後、中吳推事正式開庭、傳集原被兩造、曁證人到庭研訊、先將丘漢平之辯訴、並附帶對盧興原誣吿之反訴狀、當庭給盧收閱後、盧旋即陳述控丘</p>
<p>三項罪名</p>
<p>之起訴意旨、略謂、丘於九月三日以前、向靜安寺捕房報吿、以我與史志南杜瑞珍串同偽造王堯臣之遺囑、瓜分其遺產、請求起公訴、經捕房派中西探員查明、我昔曾任此間院長、及杜瑞珍出買貝當路地產之事實後、以毫無證據、不予受理、而丘逐代表歐陽舜英撰狀、向鈞院對我等提起自訴、丘之報吿捕房、雖云代表王歐陽氏、但該氏並未親去、而其自訴狀內、亦多</p>
<p>任意牽扯</p>
<p>自相矛盾之處、故丘之報捕爲誣吿、而代撰不盡不實之訴狀、則係敎唆誣吿、至洩漏其訴狀內容於報章、當屬公然侮辱、有意損壞我之名譽云、繼據被吿丘漢平供稱、我於九月二日、代表當事人王歐陽氏向捕房報吿、悉係秉承該氏之意旨、當本年　月間、該氏與杜瑞珍在厦門涉訟、已於上訴狀內提及遺囑</p>

<p>報紙登載此事、更與我絕無關係、盧雖指稿由我送、然其毫無證據、若我亦如彼之强詞奪理、則本案前次開庭、我並不知、而翌日各報均有登載、我亦可謂係盧洩漏、冉如主歐陽氏之國籍問題、該氏於九月二十四日因被史　南訴追債務一案、開審時、曾經當庭提及、其時盧興原爲史之代理人、在庭親耳所聞、而今忽謂該氏之提出國籍問題、係欲避面受</p>

<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>（二十四年十一月於上海）</p>
<p>——謹獻於中國國民黨、五次全國代表大會諸同志和好談政制改革的先生們—</p>
<p>（三）以　國幅員的遼闊，人民的衆多，國民黨然不能人人直接行使「政權」，憲法上的國民大會仍然是種代表行使「政權」代議機關。爲使國民黨在過渡時期領　國民行使「政權」起見，組織國民大會的國民代表的選舉，可考查俄，意，德三國的成規，再參照歷屆國民黨全國代表大會的選舉方法，於依據各縣市區人口比例規定其代表名額以後，在代表選舉法中應採用下列兩種方法的一種：（子）由國民黨　出各該市縣區加倍候選人，不限於黨員，聽選民投票决選之；（丑）由各該市縣區選民選出加倍候選人，當然也不限於黨員，交國民黨决定之。</p>
<p>（四）國民大會旣然仍是代議機關，應該在憲法中規定一國民大會代表國民全體總攪政權，以左列國民代表組織之」的一條，而牠所握有的選舉，罷免，創制，複决的政權，也自然應該有相當的規定。我以爲爲「政權「治權」劃分淸楚，行使治權的責任專一起見，國民大會的選舉權和罷免權只可適用於總統副總統，至於五院院長都可由總統提出人選徵得國民大會的伺意後任命之，對國民大會負其費任。而且國民大會的罷免總統，也祗能以總統有違法行爲時爲限，至於政策問題，國民大會祇能通過决議，請總統罷免行政院院長，以表示其不信任。當然，總統也自有罷免五院院長的權力。說到創制權，國民大會應該有權直接制定完整的法案，不過總統也應該有權可以交還複議。至於複决權，則除了國民大會自身對於立法院通過的法案可以有權複決外，總統或立法院也應該可以把立法院所通過或否認或不能成立的法案，提請國民大會複决。</p>
<p>（五）國民代表的任期規定四年，國民大會應每年召集一次，會期以一個月爲限，必要時得延長一個月。如總統認爲必要，或經國民代表三分之一以上認爲有必要時，得召集臨時國民大會。如此，則國民大會閉會期間，儘可不必設置「常設機關」來做他的代表。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c148">上海毛冷槪况業 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>（上海工商烽槪况之二）</p>
<p>一、上海毛冷業之兩大階段</p>
<p>國人衣着原料，素以棉絲蔴三種紡織品爲限；惟自有淸末葉以來，城鄕居民，於利用新舶來之呢絨織品外，且更知享受毛絨綫以自織衣襪手套之類。國人之生活內容固隨之豐富，但外商之勢力亦更得趁機滋長矣。</p>
<p>毛絨綫普通亦稱毛冷，主要係利用羊毛紡成，爲冬令衣着品之良好原料，國人初不知仿造，全由海外輸入。淸末民初之際，滬上經售是項舶來品者，尙爲一種販賣棉質或蔴質等繩之雜貨莊，規模狹小，不能成爲一業。嗣後毛冷織品，漸次風行內地，銷路日廣，獲利豐厚，滬上專營毛冷之商號遂勃然而興，演至今日，法租界之興聖街早已成爲毛冷街，爲該業之大本營，共有同業近十家，加入同業公會者二十家，大都門市與批發兼做？其中金源茂，隆興昌等數家，歷史較久，營業亦較發達。雖各百貨公司亦經售毛冷，然不若興聖街各號之集中而範圍廣大也。</p>
<p>毛冷爲舶來品，前已言之，其輸入最多者，首推英國，英倫博德運廠所產之蜜蜂牌毛冷，尤爲國人所最熟知，而銷用最多者，今將最近三年及本年爲首三季毛冷之輸入額列表如次，以供參考：</p>
<p>廿一年　廿二年　廿三年　廿四年爲首三季</p>
<p>英國　五、一六五、七七三　四、四二、四九七　四、四一八〇、四二一　未詳</p>
<p>其他各國　二、四三五、五三　二一、二〇六、八五三　二、三〇二、六〇二　未詳</p>
<p>合計　七、六〇一、二九五　六、六一八、三五〇　六、四八三、〇二三　一、一〇五、九八五</p>
<p>註：數字根據海關貿易報吿冊，單位海關金。</p>
<p>七年爲首三季之毛冷輸入，顯較去年同期大减，蓋係博德運廠實行在滬設立分廠之故，故按實質而言，英國仍爲毛冷進口商之泰斗。</p>
<p>上海爲全國工商業之重鎭，對於毛冷販賣一業自非例外。故輸入之毛冷，按關別而言，上海所佔比重甚大，試閱下表：</p>
<p>最近三年毛冷輸入關別比較表</p>
<p>廿一年　廿二年　廿三年</p>
<p>上海　五、二五六、三六七　五、一六九、五五六　五、三四一、五九九</p>
<p>其他各關　二、三四四、九二八　一、四四八、七九四　一、〇九六、四二四</p>

<p>上海定購毛冷期間，一般在將近舊曆年關之際，蓋是時本年銷，已完全定奪，一般商號可藉以測知來年之銷路，而爲定貨多少之目標也。商號定貨，十九皆委託洋行，如德記，寳華，祥臣，禮和等行，皆兼營業。過去蜜蜂牌毛冷未來製造時，大半皆由怡和，錦隆，中和三行代定。至到貨期間，一般皆在翌年之五六月，外地客銷，九月後卽吿落市。滬少毛冷客銷，可分珠江長江及華北三區，「九一八」前，東北亦　廣大之市塲，此爲上海一埠販銷毛冷之大槪情形。</p>
<p>今按上海毛冷一業，可分純粹販賣及製造兼販賣兩大階段。前者業已說明，茲再進而述共如何走入製造之階叚。</p>
<p>毛冷之爲物，原屬輕工業製品，仿造並不困難，其障碍實僅原料一端。近年　國人一方因鑒於西北羊毛之開發巳有相當成績，一方因毛冷長此由海外輸入，漏巵甚大，乃紛起設廠自製，以圖挽回已失之利益。在天津有東亞祥和兩家，在上海有振興章華（惟現已停止紡製毛冷）及上海裕民中國等五家，頗有繼績成長之氣象。此間所可慮者，卽英倫之博德運廠因吾國毛冷之課稅加重，去歲巳來滬設廠製造，逃過關稅之窒礙，且其資本雄厚，技術精良，對我方興之毛冷　族工業，實一莫大之壓力也。（未完）</p>

<p>該虫介乎高下兩等動物之間</p>
<p>此次採得海產動物一千餘罐</p>
<p>（北平特訊）國立北平研究動物研究所今春曾與靑島市政府合組「膠州灣海產動物採集團、五月一日曾赴靑島、作第一次採集、九月二十七日、復作第二次採集、工作已畢、所採得之物品、亦已運平、工作人員亦北返、記者訪該團團長張璽、據談如次、</p>
<p>採集範圍</p>
<p>此次赴膠州灣採集、爲敝團成立後之第二期工作、參加者爲北平研究院動物研究所同人顧光中、相矩里劉永彬、康樂天及本人、自九月二十七日赴靑島、至十一月二日工作完畢、共計三一十七日、除往返時間外、實際工作、不過月、採集區域仍以膠州灣及其附近之海岸爲範圍、因中國海產動物山東半島頗爲車要、爲工作便利計、故以靑島　研究中心、</p>
<p>新的發現</p>
<p>此次採得之海產動物約有一千餘罐、收獲上與第一次採集不同、因上次爲春季、此次爲秋季、海產動物因季節之不同、每有變異、故春秋兩季所獲得者、不能盡同、此次最大之收獲、爲覓得柱頭虫、異種柱頭虫等三種、此種柱頭虫在生物界、佔重要之地位、因介乎高下兩等動物之聞、但因此種動物多藏於海底沙石之間、殊難採得、此次竟獲得三種之多、甚爲欣喜、至於其他新的發現、須俟開箱一一加以研究、始能斷定、</p>
<p>明年採集</p>
<p>敝團因與靑島市政府合作關係、明年仍將前往採集、今年工作即以此爲結束、明年採集次數、至多爲三次、少則二次、是否於明年採集後、再行延長工作、此刻尙難預料、因靑島市政府規定二年內完成採集工作、（瑾）</p>

<p>「我倒也不介意的；但假如我是有些兒覺得不便　，我倒願意給你那些抽屜，因為我看重小孩們的寳物，覺得它們是應該受人敬重與孫惜的。唐恩，我現在願和你做個交易，我望你能够保着你的信用。這裏是十二個抽屜，每月一個，剛够一年之用，你如其能够盡你的一些小責任，那末你能够賺到幾個，那幾個就算是你的了。我相信某一類的酬賞特別是爲靑年人的；它們能幫助我們前進，我們初始勉於向善或是爲了酬報，但如用之得當，不久便樂於爲善而不計其他了。」</p>
<p>『你也有酬報嗎？』唐恩問道，看去彷彿以上一番話他是從未聽見過的。</p>
<p>「可不是嗎，我還非此不成。不過我的酬報，不是抽屜，或是禮品，或是多放幾天假，郤也是我所很愛好的，正如你愛好那些物事一般。我的童子們的優良品行和成功是我所心愛的酬報之一，我努力以求得它，芷如我要你努力去得到那個櫥。勉强做你所不喜歡的專，幷且要做得好，那末你可以得到兩種酬報—第一，是你目所見手所觸的獎品；其另一種則是因歡欣地盡了一樁責任而得到之愉快。你了解這點嗎？」</p>

<p>一些狐獨的人，處在舉目無親的寂寞環以下，爲欲得到相當的愛的寄托，便往往豢一頭猫，或一頭狗。而他或伊對於貓的愛，狗的愛，都是要比常人深刻的多；竟像對待自己的愛人和兒女一般，可見人類是都具有偉大的愛，這愛也就是人類唯一的美性。</p>
<p>靑年人固然不可缺少愛，因爲愛正是靑春的肥料，故當沒有得到理想的愛人時，往往像旅行在沙漠似的惝怳，枯寂，以至於病苦，及至得到了理想的愛人時，自然是如在極度的飢渴中得到了甘露，但你在這愛的美境中，不可認爲便是你的歸宿，這就是說：你不要忘了自己和社會的前途，要知一個眞正懂得愛而善用愛的人，須從狹處的愛擴大到人類中去。</p>
<p>在中國人的心中，最難找得的一種愛，就是愛國家的愛。這是中國人最大的一種短處，也是中國人吃苦的原因。這癥結就爲中國人祗知父母的慈善，而不知國家更慈愛，祗知愛人的美麗，而不知國家更美麗。</p>

<p>— 喬耘飱</p>
<p>西子湖邊的宋秦檜鐵像，那是懲惡鋤奸遺臭萬年的表示；反之，建立牌坊，留芳千古，是崇德報功的象徵；我們中華民族，本是禮，義，廉，恥，之邦，過去忠臣，孝子，節婦，貞女，怎樣旌彰伊們？常樹立一座石質牌坊，以爲後世的表率；這其間的孕育，就是今日當軸諸公耳提面命的忠，孝，仁，愛，信，義，和，平；科舉時代，功，名，利，祿，往往也在一座牌坊上面，顯出被表揚者的身分高下，譬如同是一名進士，殿廷選拔，第一賜進士及第，這座牌坊，是國家代你樹立，二名，三名，賜進士出身，同進士出身，就沒有名列第一的煊赫了；這些牌坊，大旨和現在銅像紀念堂是一樣的有悠久性；民國肇造以還，每有盛典，乃以牌坊易爲牌樓，大多拿松柏紮成，配些金碧輝煌的璧窠大字，這種歌舞昇平的點綴，可是五日京兆，就把它棄如敝屣了，頗合「築室三石米，拆屋一頓飯」的兩句成語；惟其「無邊光景一時新」，倒也視爲慣常，只爲竹匠花匠撈了一筆業餘外快罷了；現在時代進化了，這次第六屆全國運動大會，沿途所樹立的牌樓，面目全非今不比昔啊，已把竹匠花匠業餘外快打得粉碎，成了工程專家的設計，雖然它的軀幹是木質構造，觀衆的遠視，儼然立體水泥鋼骨的建築了；聽說一座的造價，要估値五百大元；它的命意，也不同向往的單純，不是大會自身增添的顏色，爲另一種團體歌頌這次壯舉的偉大，它的副作用，更是「廣告學」上「不列章二頁咧。」</p>

<p>— 石松山</p>
<p>僅僅是招考一位祇須能够寫幾個端正的字，稍微能够文字通暢一點的書記，應考的人竟有那麼的多；因爲有二十塊錢一月薪水的緣故。</p>
<p>我自從娘肚子鑽了出來，就不曾做過一會事，計算起來，快有三十年了，但是；我益不願意閒遊，實在沒得機會，總算還有些餘蔭，究竟坐吃山空，直到現在，不得不鑽頭覓縫找個職務，因爲我的生活不容我再糊塗過去。</p>
<p>有二十塊錢一個月的薪水，我巳非常的滿意，於是放大了膽子，准去應考。</p>
<p>霉氣星不曾退走，畢竟有些不大吉利，剛跑出門口，天空里忽的注下雨來，而且我沒有雨具，遲了鐘點恐怕趕不上應考時間，我决意冒雨而走。到了那里，好像浴過似的，全身是水，一件本來退了色的竹布長衫，這次定然又有許多斑點發現。</p>
<p>一位約莫五十歲光景，亮光光沒一根頭髮的老先生，也許就是校長，他是非常常的和藹，說起話來，嘴犄角兒浮着笑，也許他知道失業人的苦悶，所以這麼很誠意的對待我們。</p>
<p>考題五個，規定上午十一點四十分繳卷，我們許多人考試完畢之後，那位老先生忙含着笑臉招待我們到膳堂里去吃飯，而且這麼說；「請吃一餐苦飯，」我在想；畢竟年長的有經騐，始終沒有一點盛氣凌人的樣兒，如果是個洋裝的年靑人，恐怕另有一張嘴臉呢。</p>
<p>凡是應考的人，都在三天中聽訊，假使在規定日期內沒得音訊，也不必妄想了。我像是等待官判似的守着，但是：在許多人之中，挑選一個人，我的希望未見得樂觀，然而我還在等待音訊。</p>
<p>光陰很快的滑過去，三天早已去了，我已絕了這個思想。僅僅是招考一個書記，有這麼許多人應考，在這許多人之中揀一個人，自然儘挑，一定有這種人材，不過輪不到我罷了。</p>

<p>第二十一回　婉轉依人過庭憐月貌激昂訓壻隔室聽獅聲</p>
<p>志前聽他說過之後，背了兩手，只管在屋子裏溜來溜去。微笑點點頭道：恐怕你還不知道這裏面的詳細情形呢？人爲了錢，什麼都得屈服。就是那位姓賈的，你看他耀武揚威的端着架子，很了不得。可是有一日爲了錢的原故，人家要壓迫他的時候，他一般的得承受着。我舉一個例，說着，把聲音低了一低道：隔壁屋子裏，新搬來了一個小局長，也是個買辦之流的人物，在江南是非常之舒服的，爲了錢，他跑到甘肅去，就在一個很苦的地方，當了一年的稅捐局長。他去吃苦不要緊。在江南的一位摩登太太，打電報，把他叫到西安來，彼此會面。那局長先一日到了此地，昨天，太太也來了。晚上因爲沒有電燈，兩口子就吵了一塲。太太先說，要他解錢到西安來。局長說，來得忽忙，來不及籌欵，假使他要錢，可以同到甘肅去。太太預料着苦，還沒有答應呢。不過，我想着，他一定會去的。原因十分簡單，就因爲那個地方有錢。說着就笑了一笑。正在這時，就看到一個穿西服的少婦，高跟鞋踏着地面，得得的響了過去。他的上裝是粉紅色，外罩了靑色薄呢短大衣。下面寳藍色的裙子，走得飄飄蕩蕩的，風韻十分的好。西安剪髮的女子就不多，而他的頭髮呢，還是燙着彎彎曲曲的。雖不曾看到這個人的臉子，他是很漂亮的人，那是可以斷言的。立刻這就聽到那女子在隔壁屋子裏，生氣說話了。（三六四）</p>

<p>— 胡德先</p>
<p>我們常常看見穿西服的人，他們的袴子對着前後面，總歡喜燙一條很直的綫痕，爲了要保持這綫痕的長久不消，大多是以什麼嗶嘰或呢類作衣料，試問這綫痕怎樣來的，有何作用，我想，大家也必定要知道這回事吧！</p>
<p>據說這是十八世紀美國第一任大選統華盛頓在任的時候，有一次總統府舉行會議，議員都到了會塲，獨華氏未來，經幾次促駕華盛頓隨　換上新洗的衣服，來到會塲，衆見總統衣服綫痕整潔，後皆從之，此偶然之模仿，遂開後世西服皆燙成極顯明的綫痕的風氣。</p>
<p>像這類事，很多，又如最近上海摩登婦女的頰上塗黃，卽模仿一外國電影明星而來的，由此可見名人的一舉一動，關乎世風民俗何等地密切，更可從而推想到許多社會現象的不可窮源竟委，卽大多數是由此偶然模仿而來，所以輓近有許多不能解决的問題都歸到這個原則裏面去！</p>

<p>散花塢之勝，必至筆架峯之前面，左對三大佛，右對石筍矼，前見容城峯，然坐生花筆，而後奇境始顯，蓋始信峰所見之奇，散花塢皆能見之，而散花塢之奇，始信峰不能見也。然樵徑久塞，漫山荊棘，高與人等，山泥更滑不留趾。僕隨惟淸師上攀下瀉，隨跌帶滾，幸及其半，然猶未及散花庵舊址。佾言此路闢之，不過百元，然僕以爲此路宜分三道，一自夢筆生花而下者，可以觀瀑，一自下劉亭而下者，可以觀石筍；一自松谷庵而上者，可以觀龍潭；然後天地秘藏，似可盡顯，甚願與有心人共成之。</p>
<p>西海鬥氣像偉大，重厓疊嶂，萬戶千門，以僕定之，黃山第一。尤奇者，西海門上，松林岡，夜松萬株，莫不四株連枝共生，大皆合抱，與天都蓮花，逈然不同，杜鵑石楠，尤繁殖如海，若當春時，絢爛殆不可名狀，如斯奇境，黃山圖中，竟不著名，僕以爲若闢此地，以容新村建築，使家家倚連理之松，坐杜鵑花海，當於武陵挑源之外，更添佳話。</p>
<p>黃山興人，訓練者較少，故步履不甚整齊，山輿之製，自推泰山第一，而輿夫則以廬山爲獨步，凡黃山所認爲艱困者，若以廬山之輿人畀之，固綽然猶平地也。然廬山之輿，固以四人畀之，故一人仆，尙有六足，可以堅持，即前後二人仆，亦等於黃山輿耳。天目雖平易，亦以四人畀，此可取法。</p>
<p>黃山高七千餘尺，而觀日出惟光明頂，若文殊院則礙於玉屏峯，淸凉台則礙於容成峰，而光明頂上無一橡之庇，若宿獅林而往，寒極將不成步。予擬於玉屏峯闢一石蹬，以登玉屏之頂，則日出成咸池，適當天都之闕，必有奇觀；且近在文殊院後，此跋涉之勞，收登攬之偉績，佾心定云：其値亦不過百金耳。</p>
<p>黃山整理經費省而事功偉，但出於山僧募捐，易使遊者裹足，僕意各寺緣簿，竟可不設。但有風景需要佈置之處，口頭指點，使風雅之士，自行解囊，而建設圖樣，開闢地點，仍須得建設委員會之通過，不亦善乎？僕嘗計之，玉屏山闢一石級，則可以觀日，散花塢闢一山徑，則可盡見石筍矼始信峯諸奇：淸凉台之南，建石屋五間，則可以供遊客憇宿，而坐收雲海之觀。嘗與文殊僧心定師林僧惟淸計之，凡此計劃，大約法幣三千，亦可竣事。惟當此經濟衰落中，獨力亦難籌措，而全國水災，嗷嗷待賑者幾千萬人，亦未忍專事淸遊，不急之務。故擬盡一月之功，作畫五十幅，即以售畫所得，半數撥充水災賑濟。而以其半。移助黃山建設經費，未知大雅君子，能否助成此志耳？</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>告讀者</p>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>以小說的格局寫出前淸慈禧太后暮年的私生活的「御查縹渺錄」，終於在昨天刋完了。一共是刋了四百五十九天，因爲每天不能刋得怎樣多，以致苟延了這許多時候。</p>
<p>以我們研究小說的人的目光來看，這部書的確很有相當的價値，至少限度，趣味是極濃厚的；可是它却根本並不負着指示人生或代表某一階級呼籲底使命，所以是講不到什麼意識的。</p>
<p>譯者在從事譯述的時期內，屢承唐寳潮夫人，（卽容齡郡主）裕勛齡先生唐雲帆先生及家兄曾蔚等協助指導，並蒙讀者諸君時加匡正，實在非常感激：尤其凑巧的是滴逢原著者德齡公主來滬，又承伊自己也補正了幾點，使譯作不但悉符原著，並且還比原著格外圓滿些。</p>
<p>本報馬蔭良。周瘦鵑。黃寄萍三先生在一個三前就通知我說，為了讀者請求補報的很多，並使我一年半來所用的心血多一些着落起見，要我把全書重新整理一番，修改一番，補充一番，以便在最短時期內發行單行本。這自然是我所十分藥從的，於是復　二十餘日之力，澈底的加以檢閱補正，目下居然已完工了，書中挿圖也將一律放大，或加用彩色，大致下個月中一定可以出版了。</p>

<h3 id="c204">未老先衰 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>未老先衰，這是中國人的絕症之一。</p>
<p>「少年老成」，這是最好的誇獎之辭，說者是捋鬚微笑，聽者也面有得色，而被誇者呢，這時格外正襟危坐，「老成」得　以復加。</p>
<p>剛會走路的孩子，便給他穿上長袍短褂，孩子要頑吧，拉住了嚴加訓斥。</p>
<p>滿二十歲，便做起「壽」來；甚至，壽衣，壽材，壽域都在準備了。</p>
<p>「他們除了希望生活安定之外，什麼也不希望。他們之中的某種東西，例如「死是生的意味深長的瞬間」，同「在人類的後半生，正常的心理是死的準備的心理「。因爲這麼樣的斷言，對於死是照着原始的想法，而過了隱遁生活。（高爾基：戲曲論。）</p>
<p>在我們中國所謂「人類的後半生」，好像特別的來得早，因之，對於所謂「死的準備」，也就提早「準備」，也就「因爲這麼樣的斷言，對於死是照着原始的想法，而過了隱遁生活」。因之希望過「隱遁生活」也就格外提早，而由於希望提早過「隱遁生活」，因之「少年老成」便成了對年靑人的最好的「獎狀」。</p>
<p>中國人生是從下地來就準備死的。所謂「三歲備壽材，到老用得着」就是。</p>
<p>然而，這也眞是衰老的小市民們的瀕死的社會心理的結晶呀。</p>
<p>針對着這瀕死的社會心理的，我們可以看看秋田雨雀先生的話，他說：「你看，我才五十多歲，比起六十多歲的人，我還正是孩子呢。」</p>
<p>再來看「六十多歲」的紀德，高爾基，羅曼羅蘭們，他們又是怎樣的爲未來的人類努力着。</p>
<p>這些，與獎勵「少年老成」的未老先衰的人們，該是多麼好的對照，該是多麼好的教訓！</p>
<p>「我們根本就沒有思索到死的時候，我們從自己的手裏把握了生，更安靜地固守着。這是開張意志同理性的全力，看重不斷的英雄的緊張是極困難的工作」。</p>
<p>在暮氣沉沉，未老先衰的社會裏，這眞是最好的對症良藥，我們是祗有「從自己的手裏把握了生，更安靜地固守着」，纔能有在這社會裏生存下去的權利的。</p>
<p>然而，一我們的中間，還是有沒有埋葬的死人。他們也遝吃着，喝着，在街上散步，呼吸」。</p>
<p>並且，在這個未老先衰的社會沒有滅亡之前，他們還是要「吃着，喝着，在街上散步，呼吸」，散發腐敗了吳氣。</p>

<h3 id="c205">冬天 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>提起冬天來，有人會爲之發愁，也有人會感到十分高興，一年四個季節，原沒有固定的好或壞存在其間，愛憎的决定，全在他所處的環境，年齡與胸襟如何而巳。各個季節原係隨着大自然的軌程而推替循環，愛春，憎冬，也就只有耐住性子等待春之早來，冬之快去罷了。</p>
<p>現在登高獵游的九秋天氣到底已走完了它在季節里所佔有的軌程了。依照廢曆的算法，可正是十月的中旬，天氣縱使還沒有變得嚴冷，北風縱使還沒有把雪花吹下，照季節的推替來說，這無垠的大地之上，可經換上了一副冬天的外衣了。不久的將來，自然會漸漸顯出冬的嚴冷面目來的。</p>
<p>江南的小春十月，若果給北方人看來，也許會嫉恨大自然原來這樣偏私，獨厚彼而薄此，北地的冬天消息，古人已有『胡天十月卽飛雪』的紀詠，在季節的段落上，雖然還是小冬十月，可已失了初冬的名實了。不久以前，上海報紙曾有冬令桃花開放的紀述，這個消息若使也傳到北方去，定會使人驚奇不解，說不定還會迷信起來，說是年勢好的祥瑞徵兆。類此的故事，我們在史實里也可以找到許多紀載出來。十月之謂爲小陽春，名堂想係由此而來的。</p>
<p>在我的南方的故鄉，冬天是不會下雪的，一年四季，樹木常綠，所謂小陽春的十月，實更名副其實得多。有許多菜樹，如：桃，杏，枇杷，洋石榴等到了此時都會開花，不過很少結成果子。較常成實的只洋石榴一、種，但也不多，果子亦比夏天結熟的小，且帶澀味。然在初冬十月還可以得到這種夏季纔有的靑菓，自然要比平時看得珍貴。</p>
<p>冬天若是沒有雪景可觀，自然是很枯燥的，而冬天的可愛實又在此。下雪天，會使北風失了它的威嚴，鎭日立在朔風狂吼聲中的樹林，會把埋藏在枝頭的春天的夢做得更美麗更鮮甜。在一望無邊，白皚皚的景色裏，冬天的美麗的面目全襯托出來了，我們不會看見它的蒼凉威兇，只有無邊的雄魄與光耀。這樣的冬天，在我的南方的故鄉且不用談了，不過在那邊的孩子可也是一樣覺得冬天之來，是値得讚頌與歡迎，因爲緊接着冬天而來的仍然是更美妙的春天，和普天同慶，萬戶同歡的新年。雖沒有江南和北方的孩子幸福，在冬天有雪仗可打，（南方的民族從小也是好鬥的呢）但有新年的快樂之夢，時刻憧憬在小腦子裏，也就覺得冬天的日子並不如何難挨了。</p>
<p>中國的新年與外國的聖誕節，實都是屬於孩子們的。而且又都定在冬天。也實增加不少冬天的熟鬧和生動。一個寒冷可畏的冬天，有雪景和新年與聖誕節，難道還會寂寞麼？</p>
<p>近幾天來的天氣陡然轉冷起來了，彤雲密賴的天空倒像在做雪的樣子。在窗口外，梧桐葉子更顯得乾黃無力的等待落下，北風橫掃過橫空的電綫，發出呼呼的聲響，像聽到故人的步聲一般，心裏突然浮起一股莫名的慰藉和歡悅來了。冬天，我就是與牠有過一段交誼的，現在，我果然看着它含着熱親的笑容，輕輕的站在窗前。</p>
<p>是的，冬天已輕輕的含着親熱的笑容站在我的門前來了。夜裏，獨坐凝神之下，我聽見它用着我非常熟悉的調子節拍，叩我的門扉。可惜門上沒有裝上一隻門環，檐前也缺少一匹鐵馬，不然，它定會給我搖打出一支很動聽的樂曲來。</p>
<p>冬天來了，我相信我的夢會做得更切實，更美麗，更耀采。</p>
<h3 id="c206">鴉 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>這也許是自己的癖性，我不愛春鶯，不愛黃鸝，却愛梟，却愛鴉。鴉是不能討人歡喜的一種鳥，但所以爲我歡喜却就是在牠的不能討人歡喜。</p>
<p>然而幼時我確是憎恨着鴉的，我恨不能盡其類。我家屋後多榆樹及烏桕，其中有一株烏桕長在西北角的是最大，最雄偉，這上邊便有一個鴉巢。從我有記憶起，不論春夏秋冬這個鴉巢老是站在那株烏柏上。冬天，樹葉落完了，於是在二三里外就可見到聳立的烏柏上的鴉巢。設若有人到我家來，如不認識，於是問路人，路人會說：「哦，聞家嗎，就在那兒，就在那個高烏柏上有鴉巢的大樹園裏。」同時用手遙遙的指着。來客只要照着路人所說的去找就得了。</p>
<p>鴉，被人認爲不吉利的東西，所以我們孩子們一聽到鴉叫，平和一點時就以「大家好」（音近鴉叫的聲音）三字來和牠，不然就要說：「磨剪刀，殺老鴉！」「燒開水，泡老鴉！（老了爲我鄉鴉之俗稱。）來威嚇牠，牠若不飛開，我們便要用長竹竿去威嚇牠了。其實，我們孩子們並不懂得什麼，只是聽得長輩說，鴉叫是有凶兆，於是競相害怕着罷了。只要一聽到鴉叫，似乎就有什麼危險掉下來似的。我們拿「磨剪刀」一類話威嚇鴉，母親却常用鴉威嚇我們二譬如我們正玩得高興，母親會走　說：「一跳一跳的，好玩！剛剛有鴉叫，我知道你們都要遭打了！於是　們散開了，口裏不住的喊：烏鴉叫，晦氣到。」烏鴉叫，晦氣到。（晦氣，不幸之息。）有時一不小心打碎了什麼了，於是眞的遭打了，可是在含淚忍痛的時候，心想：這全害了烏鴉，我一定要殺死牠！」於是揑着拳頭，表示很有决心的樣子</p>
<p>幼時是一樣地憎恨着鴉的。年歲較大，長年飄泊在都市裏，漸漸忘却有鴉這種東西了。今夏返里，見到那株烏柏已沒有了，於是想起了那個鴉巢，問問年相若的兄妹輩，他們都說：不曉得，那株樹已伐去了好多年了。一他們大約早把童年的忘掉了。我也只淡淡的，不想再問什麼。</p>
<p>到這兒後，也不曾想起鴉。但畢竟是秋末冬初了，學校的前邊就是孔林，我的宿舍在孔廟後，廟後又有幾株很大的銀杏樹。於是傍晚出去散步時便見無數的鴉背途着夕陽在孔林裏亂噪。侵曉，又見老銀杏上的鴉塗着朝陽在亂噪。然而我不曾憎恨牠們，當然更沒有童心去說「磨剪刀」一類話。我只覺得一陣輕淡的悲哀襲擊着我，有時聽着，聽着，我幾乎疑惑鴉叫的聲音便是我自己的聲音了。</p>
<p>這幾天老是下着濛濛的雨，鴉也特別噪得厲害。我常常被牠噪得放下正在批改的課卷而到老銀杏底下去徘徊，低低的哼着納蘭性德的詞：「昏鴉盡，小立恨因誰？急雪乍翻香閣絮，輕風吹到膽瓶梅，心事已成灰！」默沉沉的，覺得自家眞的是鴉了。鴉，全身黑色，是極度的悲哀的象徵，牠的被人憎恨不是無因的。但此刻我有憎恨牠的理由嗎？</p>
<p>聽着冷北風裏的鴉聲——嘩——嘩——嘩——比諸讀一篇沉哀的詩何如？從此，我明白，春鶯，黃鸝的被人喜愛也不是無因的。鴉之被厭惡，實在不必替牠抱不平，因爲牠是應該被厭惡的。</p>

<p>好萊塢各大影片公司，因爲政府的訓令，在一九三五年中，攝製了不少的剿匪影片；已經在上海公映的，有華納公司的「一身是膽」，派拉蒙的「無名英雄」，米高梅的「剿匪偉績」，聯美的「皆曰可殺」等，從與論和賣座兩方面看起來，當然要算「一身是膽」最好了。現在，攝製「一身是膽」的華納公司，又復鼓其餘勇，懾成「特別偵探」Special　Agent一片，仍請威廉凱萊導演，主角則山蓓蒂黛維絲和喬治勃倫祖任。在「一身是膽」裏，是專用硬性的機關槍來對付强徒；但在「特別偵探」內，除却硬性的機關槍外，尙有軟性的女人在帮助着刺探消息，去揭穿匪窟內的一切黑幕，所以觀衆不但有激烈的械鬬看，並且還有女偵探和强徒的鬬智可看。這片子今日起在大光明公映。左爲該片之戰鬬塲面。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>日本的汽車事業。近年以來。無疑。已有長足的進展。他們的出品。數學上面。逐年在增加起來。不但在本國的汽車市塢。已確立其相當的地位。就是在海外市塲。先從東方諸國着手。也正在極力的推銷。因此。不久的將來。日本的汽車業。將有莫大的發展。我們是可以預料的。不過我們從另一面看來。日本的汽車工業。如果和英美相較。似乎還幼稚得很。出品方面。當然也不及英美。而月日本的汽車廠。目前所製者更以小型汽車爲限。祇因爲售價的特別低廉。還能向東方諸國推銷。否則便難在世界市塲競爭了。</p>
<p>美國汽車業的二巨頭　。通用和福特。在海外到處設有分廠。在日本。這兩大車廠。也早已有分廠的設立了。他們所以要在海外各國設立分廠。唯一的目的。當然在使出品方面。成本較低。在海外汽車市塲。比較容易推銷。而在同業之中。競爭也比較容易獲得勝利。因此。這種分廠的設立。對於自身方面。雖有莫大的利益而對於所在國。乾脆的說一句。無非是經濟侵略的一種罷了</p>
<p>在日本。前幾年固根本沒有所謂汽車事業。完全和目前的中國一樣。自製汽車。完全沒有。因此。對於通用和福特的設廠。並不十分注意。但近年以來。日本的汽車事業。是抬頭了。上面說過。日本的汽車工廠。近年來製造汽車。旣以小型車爲限。但通用的雪佛蘭。福特的V八。不是都是售價很低的小型車嗎。因此。通用和福特。在日本旣有分廠。其結果當然可使日本的汽車業受到相當的打擊和威脅。抬頭比較不甚容易吧。</p>
<p>對於這個問題。日本當然不會忽視。因此。政府方面。爲保護本國的汽車工業起見。制定了一種汽車工業法案。共中對於外國在日本設廠的限制。最重要的兩條便是。（一）從今而後。新設工廠。絕對禁止。就是已經設立的工廠。自本年八月九日以後。也不准擴張任何設備。（二）但如果公司的資本。過半數讓予日本國民。而以公司的支配權同時讓給日本人時。政府可允許其擴張或增設車塲。我們讀了上面的條文。已明白的可以看出日政府的用意。在限制國外汽工廠在日本設立分廠的活動。而不啻在通用和福特日本分廠的頭上。加上一副桎拷呢。據說一待下屆議會通過而後。馬上要實行的。</p>
<p>自日政府制定這種汽車工業法案而後。福特方面。表示反對。不過通用已表示有和日產公司合併經營之意見。日產在日本可算是一個規模最大的車廠。通用爲求種種便利起見。去年亦曾有過和日產合作之說。因此。這次汽車工業法案的制定。更使通用和日產有合併的可能。目前通用方面。已擬具兩種辦法。（一）把所有公司財產全部讓渡日產。（二）把百分之五十一的股票讓給日產。雙方重要職員。已經過多次的談判。不過目前還沒有决定。而且日產方面。更要受政府的指示。才可决定一切。想必通用和日產的合併。或許會成事實。不過時間問題而已。</p>

<p>美人計割壓倒甘氏紀錄自從英人甘勃爾爵士，獲得汽車速率每小時三百英里以來，世界上的車賽家都對他非常欽羨，現在美國南部有一個汽車跑駛名家仁金士，他已經在計劃着一輛新的跑駛車，預備壓倒甘勃爾的紀錄，仙願望中的速率爲每小時四百英里，比了甘氏要增加一百英里呢，賽車的地點預定在烏太蓬納維爾的鹽地上，時間約在明年秋天，仁金士現在方臥病在醫院裏。因爲新近在納許維爾地方跑車。受傷折骨。他是著名的跑車家。獲於三百多個競賽錦標。他所計劃中的新跑車具有二十四隻汽缸。意欲壓倒陸地上任何汽車速度紀錄。據他本人說這車的馬力爲三千六百匹。甘勃爾的引擎祇有二千四百匹馬力。由四輪機來推進。他又說那車子比了甘勃　的「藍烏」要格外的流綫化。每個車輪上裝有鰭狀　片。在車行速度最高的時候。仍能叫輪貼着地上。這種突片可以校正自如。因之無論那個車輪需要較多的力量。或在轉折時。那突片便能用力帮助它緊貼着地面。仁氏對於機力一層。他深信每一小時可達四百英里的速度。最低限度。也要到三百五十英里。再漸進而達四百英里。他又信這樣子可叫世界上的汽車最高速率紀率回返美國來。這車的輪距爲一百七十英寸。車子引擎的重量。據他佔計百八·〇〇〇磅至一〇·〇〇〇磅。至於蓬納維爾的跑駛塲。據說是世界上最完善的。所以他深信他的願望不致成爲泡影哩</p>
<p>九個月來美國汽車產量自從今年一月份起。到九月份止。美國汽車會會員廠所製造的汽車。一共是二·〇二九。四六輛。比較起去年同時期。計共增進了百份之十五。這個數目是包括了各種乘用汽車和運貨汽車。不過這裏要加以說明的。就是上面的總數之中。福特的出品是沒有計算在內的。除此之外。各大廠家差不多都已在內。今年各月份的汽車產額。要算九月份比較的頂少。這個緣故。據美國汽車會聲述。是由於各車廠在預備一九三六年式新車。新車是打算在十一月二日全國車展會時當塲的今年九月份的汽車產額。據該會最初報吿計共五七·八六〇輛。比起了八月份的一七九·九一八輛。計共减少百份之六十八。如果和一九三四年的九月份來比較。那末其低减爲百分之五十。因爲去年九月份的汽車產額數爲一一六·六四九輛。</p>
<p>卡迪拉克與拉薩爾新車一九三六年式的卡迪拉克和拉薩爾新車。於上月份起業已在美國各地陳列。這兩種車子現在的售價都比了從前爲低廉。卡迪拉新車計有第六十號組。卡迪拉弗理股和德組。和拉薩爾。它們的售價都大爲减削。其中的第六十號組已進入了低價車類。爲組車四缸之一九〇八年式以來最低廉的售價。在廠交貨的價格係美金一六四五元。據該廠職員稱。這種車子最專門爲一班需要卡迪拉克汽身的卓越。而又便於個人應用的式樣而造的。這車的唯一特點。就是易於停靠。對於婦人駕駛最爲相宜。卡迪拉弗理脫和德組計有V八。V十二。和V十六各種不同的引擎。車身的美觀。乘坐的舒適。和駕駛的平平穩。都是新車的特色。一九三六年式的拉薩爾車身修削優美。最爲悅目。走勢和速度咸稱完美畢異常。它的售價。廠中交貨爲美金一一七五元至一二五五元。卡迪拉克六十組新車裝有V八式馬達者。具有一百二十五匹馬力。機力非常的充實。</p>
<h3 id="c220">車胎壞了怎麼辦 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 盧雪</p>
<p>在現在的時候。車胎突然地不中用了的事情。發生的很少。照常情說。一個孔眼的罅隙很小。在氣球胎裏的氣。當然不會很快的洩完。有時駕駛者發覺車胎損壞之前。汽車已在車胎損壞之後駛過多理。</p>
<p>車胎雖有這種孔眼。汽車還是很容易駕駛。因爲氣洩出很慢。換句話說。就是警告的時期很長。如果駕駛者是留意車身的。在駕駛時他會覺得震動。這種震動是因了胎氣外洩的緣故。那時他在壓力完全洩去之前。可把車輪換好。</p>
<p>這裏有一點得特別聲明的。就是在換車輪之前。必須將汽車駛着離開了大路。我們常見人在狹而忙的路上換車輪。這不但妨礙交通。並且因別的車輛來往。他有被衝倒的危險。最好把車駛到離大路的小路或轉角上。當找這種小路或轉角的時候。只得駛得慢些。就是駛了里許。對於車胎也不會有傷害的，現在新式車有永久裝着的起重機。這在換輪時有很好的帮助。非但換輪能快。並且安全。</p>
<p>車胎突然壞了的事情也有的。不過這車胎一定本來是很奮的。或者胎套曾經不小心地施用。璧如。一輛汽車駛過一條銳利邊石的時候。車套內部索的組織就會損傷。如果這樣受傷之後。車胎仍舊施用。那時傷處很易擴大。有時竟而向外凸起。外面看着也很淸楚。如果車主那時還不把他的車胎察看一下。貽裏就會從不堅實的地方凸出。而且車胎立卽洩氣。</p>
<p>車胎除了上述爆裂之外。有時當汽車偶然駛過一個不易注意的障碍物。車胎裏的氣也會突然從裂縫中洩出。可是這種事情很少。所以。就常情論。只要我們好好地注意車胎。爆裂是不會發生的。</p>
<p>然而駕駛者却應當知道萬一車胎損壞時所應採取的方法。因了突然洩氣。車胎轉動的抵抗力會大大的增加。所以汽車很易逸出常軌。如果損壞的是前胎。越動的情形尤易發生。在潮濕的路上。並且還要滑。</p>
<p>駕駛者能把轉向輪穩穩地握住。卽使有轉向不定的情形。通常也可立刻校正。只要用力適度。轉向機　有震動。也不難使汽車向正當的路綫駛着。駕駛者有時把車駛得很快而僅把一只手指及姆指按在轉向輪的邊上。那時如果車胎突然損壞。就無法避免那轉向不定的危險。</p>
<p>在路上發生任何急要的事情。普通人總是先猛力地施用制動器。但是當車胎突然損壞的時候。這個方法切不可用。制動器的功用是在妨礙車輪的行動。所以當車胎爆裂時就用制動器。結果就會使胎套和胎環分離。這樣非但使車胎遭受那可免的損壞。而且金屬的胎環在路上磨擦後。使不正的轉向力加强。甚至把車輪摔毀。</p>
<p>有時當車胎損壞而處境有不得不把車緩駛的時候。譬如在山坡上。‘那末施用制動器也是愈輕緩愈妙。同時駕駛者須緊緊地握住轉向輪。</p>

<p>今後興築省道計劃</p>
<p>廣西已成公路雖達一萬二千餘里。然各區路綫未盡聯貫。水陸交通。未盡啣接出省幹綫。未全貫通今後興築省道計劃。對外應繼續完出省幹綫。對內應使各區路綫聯貫而接大河。所有應行繼續興築省道各綫經已預定計劃。分爲五年興築。以期逐步完成。</p>
<p>第一年度興築完成之綫</p>
<p>（一）促成邕欽路欽段此路由邕垣對河亭子圩起至吳村。與邕龍路分支。自此南行經大塘。那曉以達本省邊界之策匡奮墟。通入粵省經小董。以達欽城。爲西南各省公路出海最短捷最重要之路綫。此路在廣西界內計長二百二十里。現在雖已完全通車。但所餘欽縣界內崬匡至小董五十里尙未興築。年來迭經函電催促。幷一再派員協商。且願挪撥欵項協助。以期早日完成。但迄未就緒。本年秋間。當再派員前往妥商辦法。務期早成。俾西南各省公路。早通海口。以裕經濟而固國防。</p>
<p>（二）完成榴永路此路全長一百八十里。爲柳桂公路之支綫。亦卽柳桂路改綫後之中段。路成之後。柳桂交通較之現行之柳荔桂綫。短縮一百四十里。時間車費兩均减省。民十六以前。曾經一再踏勘。祇以溪河間阻。山嶺險峻。費鉅工難久未興築。最近因種種需要。急須完成。乃選定以榴江之長塘村邊大湖橋頭爲起點。經黃冕三里坡寨矮嶺而至永福。與桂永路啣接。本年二月間。派員測量。現在先由長三段開工。本年度全綫可以完成通車。</p>
<p>（三）興築百渡路。此路由百色經羅里田西。舊州而至八渡河岸。全長四百五十里。八渡渡河入黔之冊亨。過安龍，興義，卽可北達貴陽。西通昆明。此路聯貫以後。三省政治軍事文化諸端。固多賴以互助。而滇黔客貨。亦均可由此綫出入。關係之大。當在巳通車之丹池路。及將築之百羅路之上。蓋丹池百羅兩路均限於局部運輸。未能聯貫三省。至百渡入黔轉滇之綫。在廣西境內沿途。地較寬平。且多泥質。故路綫雖較百羅長逾兩倍以上。而所需欵比之百羅綫不過多出六十萬元左右。共餘八渡至昆明一段。工程分屬滇黔兩省。現在滇黔兩方路綫均經先後施工。目下巳粗具規模年內總可完成通車。至於百色經羅里，田西，舊州，至黔省安龍。興義入滇省羅平之綫。本爲欽渝鐵路。原定滇百段路綫。現以先築公路。則將來興築鐵路。工程進行尤爲便利。故本年度七月以後。卽加速進行。以期明年秋間完成通車。</p>

<h3 id="e4">After the Fourth Meeting of the Fifth Plenary Session, Chiang Kai-shek Gave a Speech on Foreign Relations; Elucidating the Essentials of Our Country's Self-Preservation and Friendship with Allied Nations; "With the Determination of Final Sacrifice, Make the Greatest Effort for Peace" <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Fourth General Assembly of the Fifth Plenary Session completed its discussion of proposals on the morning of the 19th, Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech on foreign relations. The original words are as follows: "Since the opening of this congress, all work has passed the halfway point. In recent days, comrades have been frankly discussing various proposals, and a spirit of sincere unity has permeated the entire congress, which is truly the most fortunate thing for the future of the country. Today, I would like to take this opportunity of the national representatives gathering together to frankly present the foreign relations of our country in recent years. I hope that the comrades will carefully review it and give practical instructions. Since the September 18th Incident, the Shanghai Incident and the North China Incident have followed one after another, and the whole country has been in a state of extreme vexation and pain. I, Chiang Kai-shek, have been entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the comrades of the whole party to serve as a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, and I feel that I am the one with the greatest responsibility and the deepest pain. However, after a long period of national disaster, we deeply believe that the whole country has gained a deep understanding. What is the understanding? It is the first meaning of the Three Principles of the People of our party, the so-called national movement, which is by no means a purely external movement. The national movement should have two sides, internal and external. The external movement is only a part of the national movement, and it is by no means enough to replace the entire national movement. In other words, externally, we should seek independence and equality for our nation in the international community; internally, we should seek self-reliance and self-strengthening for our country. According to the teachings of the Premier, he has already revealed to us. The Premier insisted on seeking freedom and equality for our nation externally, and insisted on abolishing all unequal treaties. At the same time, he vigorously advocated spiritual construction and material construction internally. Whenever we read the Premier's various posthumous works, such as the 'Outline of National Reconstruction' and the 'Strategy of National Reconstruction,' the Premier always asked our entire nation to fight together for the self-reliance and self-strengthening of the country. This is evident everywhere, and the fifth lecture on nationalism is even more obvious in telling us. Therefore, today we should earnestly reflect on how far our country has made efforts in all spiritual and material construction, the so-called self-reliance and self-strengthening in the past ten years. We should also understand that the two aspects of the national movement must be developed simultaneously and in a balanced manner to have any hope of success. If we only focus on one aspect, we will inevitably suffer unexpected setbacks. This is inevitable. This is the first thing I want to present today. Secondly, the relationship between countries and the relationship between individuals are completely different. There is absolutely no century-old hatred between countries. The diplomatic history of various European countries over the past century, whether they are united or separated, is clear proof of this. The relationship between countries is complex and broad, and it is not as simple as the relationship between individuals. There are always times when, observing an event from one aspect, it seems that countries A and B have no reason to unite, but observing from another event and another aspect, it seems that countries A and B have no reason to separate. There are many real-life examples of such situations between countries. Therefore, international relations are purely comparative and not absolute. In other words, the relationship between separation, union, friendship, and enmity between countries should be determined by the overall rise and fall of the country and the overall interests of the nation, and should not be based on temporary emotions and local interests. It is the norm that responsible politicians and revolutionaries should adhere to when weighing the priorities, comparing the weights, and making decisions. Whenever we are subjected to insults, we can only reflect on ourselves. The fifth chapter of the Doctrine of the People's Rights, which the Premier revealed to us, can be summarized as follows: There is more than one country that can destroy China, and this is what we cannot but take as a strong warning. Because this unprecedented national disaster has its own law of cause and effect and is by no means accidental. Mencius said that people must insult themselves before others insult them, and countries must attack themselves before others attack them. The Premier also often quoted this to tell us that if we abandon ourselves and cannot be self-reliant and self-strengthening, then today's allies will become tomorrow's enemies. Conversely, if we can truly be self-reliant and self-strengthening, then today's enemies may become tomorrow's friends. The ancients said that those who help themselves will be helped by others, and those who seek more blessings will be blessed. All these are the same principle. When we are in the midst of this national disaster, we can only work hard to help ourselves and seek for ourselves. This is the second thing I want to present today. In particular, the mission of the National Revolution of our party has not yet been fully accomplished. In the process of reform in a country, most of the internal and external measures will conflict or change with the old vested interests. Therefore, the resistance and slander are inevitable. At this time, there are two points that we should pay attention to: (1) We should take the completion of the "foundational work of the country" as an absolute, firm, and common creed, and should not haggle over temporary conflicts of interest. Confucius said that small impatience will disrupt big plans. The diplomacy in extraordinary times cannot be dealt with by the regular procedures used by ordinary countries. (2) International relations are constantly changing and unpredictable. Every incident has the ability to make a prompt decision, but in the end, because the whole country has a firm and common belief, and the responsible authorities have the power to respond promptly, they can turn danger into safety and stabilize the foundation of the country. This is the third thing I want to present today. Our nation accounts for one-fourth of the world's population. Its rise and fall have a profound impact on the peace of the world and the welfare of all mankind. The wise politicians of all friendly nations will be able to see this. Our eastern neighbor, Japan, must also be deeply concerned about the peace of East Asia and the welfare of both countries. What we are seeking today is only self-preservation for our country and co-existence with the international community. There is nothing else. If we can make sound and solid improvements internally and be frank and sincere in our dealings with all friendly nations, I am confident that there will be a day when we understand each other internally and externally. We can draw the following conclusions: Based on the above three points, if international evolution does not cut off the path of our country's survival and national rejuvenation, we should take the overall interests of the country and the nation as the main object. All trivial issues should be subject to the greatest patience. Furthermore, within the limits of not infringing on sovereignty, we should seek political coordination with all friendly nations with equality as the principle, and seek economic cooperation with all countries. Then, we should obey the final decision of the party and the country. I, Chiang Kai-shek, dare not be arrogant, nor do I dare to indulge myself. In short, we will never give up peace until the time of complete despair for peace, and we will not lightly talk about sacrifice until the last moment of sacrifice. The sacrifice of individuals is a small matter, the sacrifice of the country is a big matter, the life of individuals is limited, and the life of the nation is infinite. If we can have a limit to peace and a determination to sacrifice, and with the determination to make the final sacrifice, make the greatest effort for peace, and aim to lay the foundation for national rejuvenation, I firmly believe that this must be the only great policy of our party to save the country and build the country."

<h3 id="e10">The Problem of the Fineness of Silver for Industrial Use <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since the development of science, the use of silver in the chemical industry has become increasingly common. However, in China, due to the immaturity of our industries, the amount of silver used in this area is still small. Therefore, the main use of silver is as a raw material for utensils and jewelry. However, silver utensils are only available to wealthy families, while even rural women cannot do without one or two pieces of silver jewelry. Items such as hairpins, bracelets, and rings are indeed popular ornaments for women. Now, the government, in order to concentrate silver and strictly prevent leakage, has implemented management of the silver used in silver products. This is certainly a necessary measure. However, the restriction that only chemical silver can be used from now on, and that the amount of pure silver that must be mixed in cannot exceed 30 percent, is a significant departure from the 88 percent pure silver content previously used by silver shops. It is therefore understandable that there are calls that "reducing the purity of silver will make it too hard to manufacture and the quality will not be clean, making it impossible to operate."</p>
<p>In ancient China, when drastic changes occurred in the monetary system, the storage of copper was often prohibited, and even the use of copper utensils was banned or restricted, because copper was the sole material for coinage. This practice continued until the Qing Dynasty. Although silver was used as a medium of exchange earlier, it was difficult to obtain due to its limited production. Therefore, when taxes were converted to silver taels, people still protested. Although this is a phenomenon of an agricultural society, it also shows the difficulty of obtaining silver. During the late Ming Dynasty, envoys were sent to China to seek silver everywhere, causing great disturbances. Since trade with the West, the source of silver has gradually increased. In the early Qing Dynasty, strict maritime bans were imposed, and foreign ships did not arrive for a long time, causing a great shortage of silver. Even the motivation for the Opium War was probably because the import of opium accelerated the outflow of silver, attracting the attention of the government and the public, leading to a major campaign to eliminate opium addiction. Since China lacked silver, and the monetary system of past dynasties was often disrupted, causing unstable prices and insecurity for the people, the habit of hoarding silver and valuing hard currency naturally developed among the people.</p>
<p>Today, the people are still unable to break away from these old concepts. Since silver coins are not allowed to be used, ignorant people are already suspicious. If even jewelry is not allowed to be made with higher purity silver, it will inevitably lead to more misunderstandings. Moreover, the government is only concerned about the leakage of silver from the people. It should be noted that compared to silver coins, silver coins are easier to leak than silver utensils. Why not relax the ban on the purity of silver used and strengthen the management and inspection measures? All silver utensils should be prohibited from being taken abroad. In the future, except for jewelry, silver should not be made into utensils. Even items such as tripods, frames, shields, jugs, cups, and boxes should only be made of chemical silver (or containing 30% pure silver). However, silver shops should still be allowed to maintain their original purity for making jewelry, only strengthening the inspection methods. In this way, the people will not feel inconvenienced, and the consumption of silver in silver utensils will also be limited. The "Regulations on the Management of Silver Used in Silver Products" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance state that "industrial silver, upon special approval by the Ministry of Finance, shall not be subject to the restrictions of 30 percent in Articles 2 and 6." Therefore, it seems that there is room for flexibility in the purity of silver for industrial use.</p>

(1) In the past, the use of silver in our country caused currency inflation and deflation, which was often manipulated by world silver prices. Now, due to the implementation of the new currency system, a sound monetary foundation has been established, and the tension and relaxation of finance has been adjusted, enabling the rational development of a country's economy. (2) After the implementation of the new currency system, centralized reserves and unified issuance have concentrated resources. At the same time, the organization of the central bank and general banks has been improved, the rediscount system has been implemented, and capital activity has been increased and rationally utilized, creating a modern financial market. The foundation for domestic economic development has now been laid. (3) In the past, engaging in international trade required bearing the risk of price and gold and silver exchange rate fluctuations, causing international trade to deviate from the right track, turning into gambling and speculation, and rarely developing steadily. After the implementation of the new currency system, the exchange rate is stable, the risk is reduced, and international trade can naturally become more prosperous. At the same time, international capital can flow, and capital that previously fled to foreign countries may gradually return. (Nineteenth, Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the implementation of the new currency policy, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have received six parts of the reserve funds in cash.

(Nineteenth, Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The memorial ceremony for the completion of the National Revolutionary Army Martyrs' Cemetery will be held on the 20th. The memorial oration of the Central Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee has been drafted and will be officially read at the memorial ceremony on the morning of the 20th. The original text is as follows: On November 20, the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Central Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully offer sacrifices to the spirits of the martyrs of the National Revolutionary Army, alas! Since the rise of the National Revolutionary Army, they marched to the Lingnan Mountains, quickly established stability in Jiangnan, crossed the Huai and Han Rivers, and comforted the Central Plains. However, before the wounds of war could heal, tigers and leopards occupied the passes, rose up with swords, and shed blood like torrents. The integrity of Wang Yi's determination almost lost the foundation of the former cause. In these six or seven years, in hundreds of battles, large and small, millions of people were wounded or killed. Who does not have parents to cherish and raise? Who does not have a wife and children to rely on? Why do they abandon their lives and disregard their safety, and go to their deaths as if they were nothing? It must be that there is a heart that cannot bear to see suffering, and a spirit of righteousness, which is manifested in swiftness, courage, and resoluteness, like rescuing the drowning and relieving the hungry. Alas, our President has ascended to heaven for a long time, but his spirit is not far away. He has shown us the great aspiration of saving the world and saving people, and entrusted it to comrades who will succeed and achieve benevolence. When the alarm was sounded on the three borders, and thousands of troops roared in anger, flying bullets were like hail, and corpses piled up in trenches, they rose up again after being wounded and advanced as swiftly as wolves. The wind was sad and the sun was dark, and the suffering could not be described. They were already getting closer and closer to heaven, and further and further away from people. Their spirit and breath were connected to the President, and their lives and families were regarded as insignificant. Alas, life is finite, and the changes in the world are endless. By splitting wood with wedges, it can be passed on and forged. By guiding with chisels, it can be opened up if one does not give up. Recalling the past, we engrave it in our hearts. We rectify the stubborn and establish morality, rely on wisdom and exhaust loyalty, continue the previous efforts together, and strive to achieve complete success. Perhaps the ship of a great river can only be saved after danger, and the sacrifices of famous mountains will become more and more grand over time. May you enjoy the sacrifice!

<p>(Washington) At this morning's meeting of the American Merchant Marine Association, Secretary of Commerce Roper stated that if war were to occur, the United States would feel a lack of merchant ships. Although we are currently building ships to reach the strength permitted by the treaty, we have taken no action on new auxiliary ships. The Navy feels that there are not enough merchant ships to meet emergency needs, and merchant ships are particularly inadequate in terms of speed. It must be understood that merchant ships must receive financial and spiritual assistance from the government in the current situation of gradual progress. The United States would need 900 merchant ships, totaling 6 million tons, in the event of a major war. Currently, the United States only has 488 merchant ships engaged in overseas trade, totaling 3 million tons. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Fifty-Two Countries Sever Economic Relations with Italy, Rome Remains Calm, No Xenophobic Disturbances</p>
<p>(Geneva) The first day of the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy began at midnight today. In world history, this is an innovation in using bloodless methods to punish a militaristic country. A total of fifty-two countries are participating in the sanctions. The four other members of the League of Nations whose economic positions are not very important – Austria, Albania, and Paraguay – have refused to participate. France has stopped importing Italian silk, and Cuba has refused to import Italian fruits and olive oil. British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies have boycotted Italian rubber. Yugoslavia, Iran, and Egypt have refused to supply Italy with mules, camels, and food. Sweden and Russia have stopped selling raw materials such as nickel and magnesium to Italy. Banks around the world have also stopped lending to Italy. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Except for some student demonstrations in Burma against sanctioning countries which resulted in minor conflict, in the major cities of Italy, no foreign hatred happened today when the League of Nations members began implementing economic sanctions. The British Embassy and others in Rome were all protected by military forces, preventing incidents. There are now over 50 nations who are fulfilling their obligations in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations treaty, forbidding the shipping of goods to and from Italy. Although Egypt is not a member, they have notified the League of Nations that they are prepared to act in the same way. At the same time, the governments of Germany and the United States, who are not affiliated with the League of Nations, have also adopted measures to facilitate the actions of the member nations. According to dispatches from Geneva, Argentina has notified the League of Nations Secretariat that they are currently forbidding exports of major commodities such as petroleum and steel. Geneva insiders deem Argentina's decision as extremely important as this act will lead to member nations limiting exports to Italy, especially oil products, through concerted action. The British Treasury has issued orders pertaining to economic sanctions in the past few days, stipulating that debts owed to Italian exporters should be delivered to the newly appointed British-Italian debt administrator, and stipulating that any goods imported into the UK must be accompanied by a certificate of origin to prevent Italian goods from being mixed in. France has implemented sanctions against Italy through government orders, forbidding Italian goods from being imported into French territory, and banning the transportation of raw materials listed by the League of Nations Commission to Italy. French veterans have nominated representatives to visit Prime Minister Laval at the end of the week to protest against the implementation of sanctions. Laval replied that on the one hand, he advocates that France fulfills its obligations under the alliance agreement, and on the other hand, will continue to strive to promote a peaceful resolution as soon as possible. In addition, there has been no formal statement from France. The transportation of goods on Italian railways is currently very scarce. Many trains have now been suspended in order to save coal. Trading on the Rome Stock Exchange is also limited due to the uncertain situation. An Italian government spokesperson today asked journalists to publish in newspapers the situation of the Italian people remaining calm even in times of provocation. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Awaiting Military Progress in East Africa, Reconvening on the 18th of Next Month</p>
<p>(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party continued its meeting yesterday evening at 10:00, ending only at 1:00 this morning. According to the communique, "Prime Minister Mussolini presented a report on military and political affairs, lasting for more than two hours." Following the Prime Minister, the speakers were: Grandi, the Ambassador to the UK, reporting on the public opinion situation after the completion of the UK House of Commons elections; Air Force General Balbo, the Governor of Libya in Africa (Britain has requested the Italian government to recall him to his home country); Thaon di Revel, the Minister of Finance; Marconi, the Senator and radio inventor (who recently made an invention said to be astonishing regarding motorized warfare); Volpi, the President of the Senate; and Farinacci, the former Secretary of the Fascist Party. The current session of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party has ended and is scheduled to reconvene on the 18th of next month. It is said that the next month will be a period of "waiting." Regarding military affairs in Africa, the detachments commanded by Generals Maravigna and Pirzio Biroli are currently engaged in mopping-up operations in the Danakil Alps area and have not yet concluded the affair. The Italian army may not immediately engage in large-scale operations. Regarding diplomacy, there is currently no progress. Prime Minister Mussolini's recent discussions with British Ambassador Drummond concerned the Mediterranean issue and were unrelated to the Abyssinian incident. This conversation only achieved psychological progress. Italian sources believe that if a major military victory is achieved, a new environment will be created, and diplomatic work will naturally become more convenient. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>

(2) The payment for the goods has been paid in advance and has been remitted to an Italian bank. (3) Those who wish to export wool, cotton, silk, or other goods have obtained permission from the relevant specialized bureau for those goods.

<p>The United States St. Peter's, Pacific Maritime Union announced today that the union's seafarers will not agree to work on American ships loaded with military supplies bound for the Italian-Ethiopian war zone. This move has created a new development in the US attitude toward the Italian-Ethiopian conflict and the European crisis. The Department of Commerce had previously announced that trade with belligerent countries is against American policy and stated that American diplomacy does not protect maritime shipping in wartime. Now the union's spokesman then stated that after the ship sets sail, Britain and France may have already started war with Italy, so the union has made this resolution. As for the dockworkers along the Pacific coast, they do not intend to interfere with loading cargo onto foreign ships bound for the war zone. However, since the government does not protect American ships, why order American seafarers to take this risk? At the same time, the cargo ship Oregon, fully loaded with gasoline bound for Manila, Shanghai, and Singapore, has not yet set sail because the seafarers are unwilling to work on the ship before obtaining an affirmative reply from Secretary of State Hull that protection will be provided.

<p>Goodstein, The American International Trade Association convened a meeting today. Simpson announced the thesis of retired Rear Admiral Phelps, saying that if the US embargo on Italian goods were expanded to include raw materials, it would be an unfriendly gesture towards Italy. If Britain uses the name of sanctions to illegally blockade Italy, resulting in the interception of American goods at sea, then the American people will not submit. The chairman of the meeting was Frankel, the former chairman of US Steel. During today's meeting, those present had quite divergent opinions on the issue of trade with Italy and sanctions. Mr. Fei's thesis advocating the continued protection of transport by the United States, received unanimous approval in the meeting. Furthermore, Fei's discussion on the Far East issue, saying that the independence of the Philippines has caused complex situations on both sides of the Pacific and the Mediterranean, also received great attention from the audience. Fei said, "The United States is digging its own grave, and has allowed Britain's old friend, Japan, to confine the US Navy to one corner of the Pacific, weakening its national defense in the Atlantic direction, and leaving the gateway to the commercial routes of the Atlantic wide open. In fact, these commercial routes are more important to the American people's livelihood than Manchuria. If the League of Nations were to announce a blockade of Italy, then America's Atlantic commerce would be completely at the mercy of others." Former US Ambassador to Chile, Culbertson, opposed Mr. Fei's views, saying that the US should support the League of Nations' sanctions against aggressor nations. (18th National Telegram)</p>

It is heard that the wording of the reply is quite sharp, stating that the implementation of economic sanctions is the result of Italy disregarding the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant and refusing to consider collective opinions. As for the content of France's reply, it is largely the same as England's reply, but the wording is more moderate, only stating that if Italy continues its aggression against Abyssinia, the sanctions against Italy cannot be lifted.

<p>(Rome) The newly appointed High Commissioner to East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces, General Badoglio, together with his two sons (one an air force officer, one an artillery officer) and Deputy Governor of Eritrea, General Gusani, and others, recently arrived at the Port of Naples. They will board the "Sunnia" steamship tonight to take up their new posts in East Africa. (18th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The appointment of General Badoglio as Commander-in-Chief is seen as a sign that the Italian army will engage in offensive operations with a large-scale plan. Until now, the Italian army has been operating cautiously, so progress has been slow, and no major battles have been seen. Italy is clearly changing its strategy because various countries are now implementing sanctions against Italy. Its military leaders may have received instructions to conquer Abyssinia as quickly as possible in order to avoid prolonging the war, which would cause Italy to feel the impact of economic sanctions and be detrimental to the war effort.

<p>Abyssinian Capital: The Italian forces in East Africa are temporarily suspending their offensive until their new Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio arrives, while the Abyssinian army is actively preparing for its first real resistance. It is rumored in the Abyssinian capital that the Abyssinian King will soon personally go to the northern front to encourage the soldiers. Today, sixteen trucks left for the Taishi Abyssinian army base, twelve of which were fully loaded with the Abyssinian King's personal items. The remaining trucks were equipped as Red Cross ambulances and managed by an Austrian doctor. It is believed that the Abyssinian army is still holding the strongholds of Dagabu and Sasabani on the Worgaden Line. Reports regarding these two places are often conflicting. However, the fall of Gola Hai has been admitted by non-official sources. It is said that the Abyssinian army abandoned the town as a tactical maneuver to free up troops to defend against the Italian army advancing along the Tafan River. It is also heard that the Abyssinian army is preparing to fiercely defend against the Italian army attempting to occupy some freshwater wells southeast of Sasabani. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Bombs Fall Like Rain, Abyssinian Army Suffers Over a Thousand Casualties, Italian Prime Minister's Son-in-Law Directs Massacre</p>
<p>Asmara: Italian aircraft carried out the largest attack since the start of the war yesterday, fiercely attacking the Abyssinian army's defenses built in the Mewehafe and Memsestik valleys south of Magal, destroying many military supplies. Twenty heavy bombers participated in the operation, including Mussolini's son-in-law Count Ciano and Mussolini's two sons. The planes left Asmara early yesterday morning. Several hours later, they spotted the enemy, numbering about 15,000. At the signal, the planes descended to less than a hundred feet from the ground, dropping two-pound bombs and strafing with machine guns. The Abyssinian army immediately scattered, but at least hundreds were hit before they could run to shelter. The attack lasted for two hours. The Abyssinian army responded with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. Ciano, after returning from battle, reportedly told a Reuters reporter that his plane had been hit by anti-aircraft shells three times and by rifle and machine gun bullets thirty-six times. Other planes were hit an average of ten times. The fuel tank of his plane had been pierced by a bullet and he was forced to land in Magal. One of the pilots in his plane had his leg bone shattered by a bullet, but he still used his thumb to plug the bullet hole in the fuel tank, allowing the plane to continue flying. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Officials here announced today that in yesterday's large-scale Italian air attack on the Abyssinian army's defenses in the Mewehafe and Memsestik valleys south of Magal, only two Italians were injured. The planes dropped a total of six tons of bombs. According to unofficial estimates, no fewer than a thousand Abyssinian soldiers were killed. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Tigre Province Front: The correspondent of this newspaper traveling with the army, Bal News, reported that between the Anami-Xiaer City and the city east of Magal, and the Meiweixi River and Meiweili River, there were two thousand Abyssinian army troops. Italian air force units launched an unexpected attack, launching no less than six thousand kilograms of bombs. The Abyssinian army death and injury count is around six thousand. It was the most fierce aerial attack since the beginning of the war. The Abyssinian army defended themselves using rifles and machine guns, but did not shoot down a plane. Prime Minister Mussolini’s son-in-law also participated in the war personally. Midway through the flight, the engine of his plane started leaking oil. He was forced to land in Magal. The only one injured was a pilot named Billago. Mussolini’s two sons also engaged in the war by flying a plane. The machine guns they carried ran out of ammunition, therefore they shot at the Abyssinian forces using their rifles. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Tigray Front: Bal, a reporter of this newspaper traveling with the army, reports that the Italian army is now advancing eastward in two columns towards Danbian City. It is likely that the Abyssinian General Sai Xiong's heavy forces stationed there will resist the Italian army. The first column started from Magal City, and the second column started from Gangdi Mountain and has occupied the Akello Pass. It is reported that the Italian army previously sent outposts to reconnoiter in front of Danbian, but they encountered a large Abyssinian army, so they retreated immediately. In addition, a portion of the Second Army Group is searching for enemy troops in the Natir area. Another Blackshirt regiment is camped near Abakahan. According to air reconnaissance, there are large Abyssinian forces in the Meweharu and Attala areas, and an Abyssinian column is advancing north between Andami Xiaan and Buga City. It is also heard that the Italian authorities in Aduwa City have established a committee to adjudicate cases for the native people of Abyssinia. The committee is composed of local gentry and nobles.

<p>Cairo: Nahas, the leader of the Egyptian Nationalist Party, sent a telegram to the League of Nations Secretariat today, strongly opposing British actions in Egypt and requesting the League of Nations to act as a referee between independent countries and aggressor nations. The telegram stated that the Egyptian government had recently proposed concluding a mutual agreement with Britain to guarantee each other's interests, with Egypt joining the League of Nations as one of the conditions of the agreement. However, this proposal was rejected by Britain, which proves that Britain does not want Egypt to implement the 1923 constitution and benefit from it, or that it certainly does not want Egypt to enjoy real independence.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat received telegrams today from the Egyptian Nationalist Party and the Cairo Student Union, opposing the British government's attitude towards the Egyptian constitution. Both telegrams were informal in nature and were not published.

At the same time, the turbulent situation in Egypt seems to have hindered the negotiations between Britain and Italy regarding the Mediterranean. Although sanctions against Italy have been implemented, it is widely believed that both Britain and Italy feel that the Mediterranean issue should be resolved as soon as possible.

<p>(London) According to financial circles, the British and Soviet governments began negotiations today to have Britain grant commercial loans to the Soviet Union, so that trade relations between the two countries could be established on a solid foundation. Considering the general economic situation of the Soviet Union, there is a desire to see improvement, and the recent Soviet government order to stabilize the ruble price, stipulating that each ruble is equivalent to three French francs, further proves the success of the Soviet government's currency system reform. Therefore, trade relations between Britain and the Soviet Union will inevitably be smoother from now on. For several years, the British government has repeatedly taken various measures to promote British-Russian trade. This time, the two countries have begun negotiations again, hoping to borrow from Britain to purchase British goods for the Soviet Union. It is expected that the negotiations will have successful results. As for officials, they are unwilling to release detailed information, only saying that the purpose of today's negotiations is to extend loans to the Soviet government for the purpose of purchasing railway materials from Britain. This type of commercial loan has recently also been granted to the Soviet Union by Germany. In this negotiation, the government will inevitably take into account the interests of British bondholders of bonds issued during the Tsarist era. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Shen Baixian Reports on Flood Prevention Efforts in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>More than one million laborers mobilized in each county, Disaster area losses exceed 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News: Shen Baixian, Director of the Department of Construction, reported on the flood prevention efforts in Northern Jiangsu at the Joint Party-Government Memorial Week on the 18th, saying: "Since the Yellow River breached its banks on July 10th until now, it has been more than four months. According to statistics, in these four months, the number of people and civil servants in various counties who participated in flood prevention work has exceeded one million. The district-by-district report numbers are as follows: (1) Tongshan District (Tongshan, Peixian, Pizhou, Fengxian): A total of 390 kilometers of embankments were built, with 4,560,000 cubic meters of earthwork, mobilizing 480,000 laborers. (2) Counties along the Central Canal (Suqian, Siyang, Lianshui, Huaiyin): 300 kilometers of embankments were built, with 2,100,000 cubic meters of earthwork, mobilizing 300,000 laborers. (3) Counties along the Liutang River (Shuyang, Donghai, Guanyun): 250 kilometers of embankments were built, with 4,180,000 cubic meters of earthwork, mobilizing 280,000 laborers. A total of 940 kilometers of embankments were built in eleven counties, with 8,950,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and 1,060,000 people were mobilized. As for its effectiveness, the west embankment of Weishan Lake is 120 kilometers long, which is enough to prevent water from invading the west. The Henaan embankment is 100 kilometers long, which was built from the Huaiyin District, and is enough to prevent water from invading the south. The Liuyang-Donghai Dike is 100 kilometers long and is built along the highway, serving as a barrier to protect Donghai and Shuyang counties. This embankment project was extremely fast, taking no more than 15 days at most, and some were completed in just 10 days. Although the flood has subsided somewhat now, according to the past water levels at Hanzhuang, the highest was only 36.5 meters, but this year the highest reached 37.00 meters, and it is currently still between 36.4 and 36.5 meters. The breach has not been plugged, and the flow rate is still more than 2,000 cubic meters per second. Considering the evaporation in the middle and the capacity of Weishan Lake, at 1,000 cubic meters per second, the downstream flow exceeds the standards set by the Economic Commission by a large margin. If the breach plugging problem is solved, it can be completely retreated within two months. The counties affected by this disaster include Tongshan, Peixian, Pizhou, Fengxian, Suqian, Siyang, Lianshui, Shuyang, Guanyun, Donghai, etc., with a disaster area of ​​approximately more than 8 million mu. Comparing it with the situation in the 10th, 15th, and 20th years of the Republic of China, the period is longer and the disaster is more severe, but due to effective protection, the disaster area only accounts for one-fifth. Although autumn crops have been harvested, winter crops cannot be planted. 8 million mu of farmland have been flooded, and at 10 yuan per mu, the loss is 80 million yuan. Adding the loss of houses, etc., it should be more than 100 million yuan. Now, in addition to hoping to plug the breach as soon as possible, the post-disaster engineering and relief work are particularly urgent. Because the Huai River has little water this year and the Bengbu water level is only 15 meters, if the Huai River and Yellow River floods occur together next year, the situation in Northern Jiangsu may be more serious than it is today."</p>

<h3 id="e80">Zhangzhou-Sui Command Consultant Wu Zhi's Family Member Also Killed <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Wu Ci, the famous leader of the Tenth Army in Zhangzhou, was appointed as a consultant to the Sui Command after surrendering last year. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, Wu took a rickshaw from his private residence to visit friends on Dongmen Street. He suddenly realized that there were people following him in front and behind. Realizing that something was wrong, he hurriedly got out of the car and was about to rush into the Hongji Rice Shop, but four thugs had already approached and fired four shots with Mauser pistols. Wu was hit by one bullet and was about to draw his gun to fight back when he was shot several more times and collapsed on the steps, dying instantly. Seeing that Wu was dead, the four thugs and other thugs stopped a car, got in, and urged the driver to drive away quickly. The police on duty heard the sound and rushed to the scene, but it was too late. They immediately reported to the Third Resident Office by telephone and rushed to the scene of the murder to investigate. They saw that Wu had been shot five times and died, lying in a pool of blood. The Sui Command is strictly investigating the case, and the City Defense Department has ordered the Debt Collection Office and the 478th Regiment to strictly arrest the murderers. The 478th Regiment dispatched dozens of soldiers by car to Guokeng to investigate. Wu is survived by a wife, four concubines, and five sons, and was 41 years old. Three hours after the Wu case occurred, a passenger car No. 136 from Zhangnan drove from Punan to Zhangzhou. When the car arrived at Nankeng Shekou, three people shouted to stop the car, twisted two passengers off the car, and opened fire, shooting randomly until the two passengers fell to the ground, and the three thugs fled. After the thugs left, other passengers got off the car to check and saw that one person was dead and the other was seriously injured. They sent the injured person to a local hospital for treatment. According to the injured person, his name is Yu Shu. He received a telegram from the family of Wu (Ci), the consultant, saying that Wu had been assassinated and asked him to bring money to Zhangzhou. So he and Liu Shenyuan brought more than 800 yuan and came by car. Unexpectedly, they were attacked by a gun. Liu had been killed, and the money had been taken. In the evening, Yu also died of his injuries. The 478th Regiment also dispatched troops to Punan to investigate and arrest the murderers. (November 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Bandit Den Cracked Down in Qingdao <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Two bandits killed and five captured on the spot; patrol officer and three policemen also injured</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Because of the strict military and police defense in Qingdao and effective household registration inspections, the local area has always been peaceful. However, due to the recent economic panic and rural bankruptcy, villagers have no way to make a living and have resorted to desperate measures, resulting in frequent kidnapping cases in various places. Qingdao has also been affected. On the 31st of last month, two robbery cases occurred in Dongtaiping Village. Wang Shize, Director of the Public Security Bureau, believing that robberies had occurred during the winter defense period, issued a general order to all district teams to investigate. At about 5:00 PM on the 14th of this month, two bandits, Liu Shouwen and Wang Zongwen, were wandering back and forth on the road near the Dazhanshan Temple, intending to rob. It happened that two forest policemen from the Agricultural and Forestry Office were passing by and saw that the two bandits were acting suspiciously, so they stepped forward to question them. The bandit Wang Zongwen, seeing that the situation was not good, fired a shot at the forest policeman and fled in a hurry. Another bandit, Liu Shouwen, was unarmed and was arrested on the spot. After a brief interrogation by the Agricultural and Forestry Office, he was sent to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. However, the bandit Liu was extremely cunning and refused to tell the truth. Later, the Fourth Branch escorted him to Dongtaiping Village to be identified by the robbery victims. It turned out that he was the bandit who committed the robbery with a gun. The bandit, seeing that there were witnesses, had no way to deny it and confessed that he had an accomplice named Liu Yuegong, who currently lives at No. 18 Caoxian Road. So they went to the address to arrest him. The bandit Liu jumped out of the back window to escape but was also captured. According to Liu, he is from Shanxian County, 25 years old. Because the situation in his hometown was not good, he came to Qingdao to find work. On the evening of the 31st of last month, Wang Zongwen and others invited him to commit a crime, so he went to Dongtaiping Village. After the incident, he only received one yuan. Now, Wang Zongwen, Zhang Zigang, and five others are hiding at No. 27 Zhongjiawa, with three pistols, etc. After taking the confession, Ling Han, Director of the Fifth Branch, led patrol officer Meng Dexuan and chief police officer Hao Huajun, etc., to arrest them by police car at 11:00 PM on the 14th. It was late at night and the sky was dark. Patrol officer Meng Dexuan and police chief Dai Shouheng and others bravely climbed over the wall. At this time, the bandits in the house were already awake and opened fire from inside the house. At the same time, the police officers also returned fire. After a long battle, patrol officer Meng and policemen Zhang Dazhu and Pei Dengshan were all injured and fell to the ground. Director Ling still supervised the police to move forward bravely. Then, police officer Zhou Jijin risked breaking into the house and hugged the bandit Wang Zongwen, who was carrying a gun. At the same time, Director Ling also led the police to break in. The bandits were all captured, and the bandits Li Zikui and Liu Shenwu were killed on the spot (both of the above bandits were injured by gunfire). Zhou Zhenqing was also captured. The injured patrol officer Meng Dexuan was hit by three bullets, one bullet passed through his right arm, one bullet grazed his right breast, and one bullet passed through his left shoulder. Policemen Pei Dengshan's left wrist was pierced by one bullet, and Zhang Dazhu's right shoulder was pierced by one bullet. All were sent to Zhongwen Hospital for treatment. The robbery case in Dongtaiping Village was thus solved. (16th)</p>

<p>Another Suspect Apprehended in Car Robbery Case</p>
<p>In the case of the bandit robbery on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway near Yanggong Temple, the Water Patrol Team and the Security Team have jointly arrested and interrogated the principal offenders, Zhang Xiaobaogen and He Xiaoshang. The remaining bandits are still being hunted. Patrol officer Sun Zuoqing of the Caoging Ninth Resident Office learned that Lu Bojun, a resident of No. 11, Sixth Jia, Fourth Bao, Huqiao Township, was suspected of colluding with the car robbers. He led the police to arrest him for interrogation at the county bureau. According to the confession, he is 88 years old, from Shaba Tu, and has an elderly mother at home. He usually only gambles with He Xiaoshang and others at home. I did not participate in the car robbery. It was indeed done by someone and his apprentices Zhang Xiaobaogen and others. I did not get any of the stolen money. However, on the fourth day of the tenth lunar month this year, I took six or seven long and short guns with someone to rob the homes of Mei Daohang, Mei Xingting, and Gu Jisheng in Sunjiaqiao, Fengxian County, and divided three yuan, etc. The bureau feared that the suspect would evade the car robbery and downplay the seriousness of the crime, so it decided to detain him for further investigation.</p>

<p>College Student Arrested for Trafficking in Opium</p>
<p>Tao Zhaorong, a student from a university in Shanghai, from Jiangxi, 25 years old, came to Suzhou from Shanghai on the 18th, carrying a large amount of opium. He stayed at No. 58, Dongwu Hotel, Dama Road outside the Lvmen Gate. The matter was discovered by the police district in charge. At about 8:00 PM, inspector Cui led a team of police officers to arrest Tao Zhaorong. More than 100 taels of opium were found in his luggage and he was taken to the district and transferred to the general bureau. Later, on the 19th, he was sent to the County Anti-Smoking Association for further investigation. Zhao Ming, who was in contact to purchase the opium, escaped during the chaos and is now being hunted.</p>
<p>County Government Forms Field Rent Public Judgment Office</p>
<p>The landlords in Suzhou have successively opened warehouses to collect rent. However, it has been five days since the warehouses opened, and the harvest has not improved, and the total amount is less than 20%. The landlords, in order to show consideration for the tenants, extended the first payment deadline by ten days. In order to handle the disputes between landlords and tenants, the county government specially organized the Field Rent Public Judgment Office and hired local impartial people to serve as committee members. It will be established within a few days. In the future, all disputes between landlords and tenants will be handled by the office for public judgment. If there is any dissatisfaction, they can formally file a lawsuit with the court according to the law. However, matters concerning tenants' rent arrears will be decided by the county government through administrative adjudication and are not within the scope of public judgment to avoid conflicts with the law.</p>

(2) The Chengguan County is ordered to capture the wanted bandit Peng Shengrong and bring him to justice. (3) The local township Baoczhang should be severely punished as a warning to those who harbor bandits. The above decision will be ordered to be followed by the two counties.

<p>Township Security in Six Counties of Nantong</p>
<p>Banditry has been rampant in the township areas of the six counties of Nantong in recent days. Xu Zhen, the Nantong District Commissioner, believes that the crux of the banditry lies in the fact that the government has not planned for prevention, and the people lack the ability to organize self-defense, so that bandits and petty thieves take the opportunity to steal. He has formulated the Township Security Implementation Measures for each county, stipulating that household registration should be strictly enforced, the Baojia system should be used for investigation, and patrol teams should be organized with townships as units. On the one hand, the police of the Public Security Bureau and the Security Team should maintain close contact. The special commissioner will send officers to the townships of each county at any time to carry out random household registration checks and patrols.</p>

<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>I am recording the convenience of my previous trip with the Sixth Academic National Body conference in Nanning, Guangxi, for sightseeing in the South. On July 30th, I departed from Shanghai on the President Coolidge liner, and on August 30th, I returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the President Lincoln liner. The journey lasted exactly one month. The round trip passed through Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Sanshui, but I only stayed for two or three days. Eighty percent of the trip was spent in Guangxi Province, from the commercial center of Wuzhou to the political center of Nanning, then to Longzhou to inspect the border defense facilities, and out of Zhennanguan, across the border to Lang Son in Annam, then back to Nanning, then to Liuzhou, and finally to the cultural center of Guilin. I traveled south along the Li River, passing through Yangshuo, Pingle, and Zhaoping, and then returned to Wuzhou. I traveled by boat for five days and by car along the Guangxi Provincial Highway for six days, covering more than 10,000 li in winding and rushing routes. I have been to all eight districts of Guangxi Province, except for Baise and Tianbao. People say it's a fleeting glance, but the reporter turned the fleeting glance into a racing car. The shadowy black images flew past. There's no way to talk about any impressions, but based on the oral descriptions of the local people and the general phenomena, I have taken the sightseeing and visits as a reference to synthesize my personal impressions and write them down as the conclusion of this trip to Guangxi.</p>
<p>First, Guangxi's clean politics starts from the highest authorities. The top leads by example and works hard. It is truly admirable. Chinese politics is very simple. As long as civil officials are not greedy for money and military officers are not afraid of death, the government will be clean and the world will be peaceful. The Guangxi authorities recognize this point and practice it themselves. On the one hand, they strive to promote thrift from the root and strictly prohibit public officials from gambling, whoring, and other bad and luxurious habits. From the commander-in-chief, deputy commander-in-chief, chairman, and department heads to the clerks, all wear the same gray homespun uniforms and hats, with no difference from ordinary people. The provincial chairman, Huang Xuchu, is often seen running on the street, and the commander-in-chief, Li Zongren, riding alone near the city is very common. This kind of gray cloth uniform costs two and a half yuan a set. An American advisor also took off his stiff, high-grade woolen suit and wore a gray cloth Western-style suit, saying to everyone that it was cheap and comfortable. This proves that customs can change psychology. Since public officials have abandoned all bad habits, their personal lives are naturally extremely simplified. A monthly salary of one or two hundred yuan is enough to cover expenses, so they will not risk their lives to engage in corruption. The so-called radical measure is that all officials in Guangxi Province dare not take a penny other than their own salaries. It is also possible to be incorruptible only after being thrifty.</p>
<p>Second, Guangxi's militia training starts with the lower-level farmers, doing everything practically, not seeking form, and completely eliminating the drawbacks of military-civilian alienation. The spirit of dry work is most fully manifested in the training and organization of the militia. The village militia is the foundation of the organization. The village chief serves as the captain of the militia reserve team and the principal of the national elementary school, combining military, administrative, and educational affairs. The village chiefs are graduates of middle school or above, have received rigorous training, and are all promising young people with innovative minds. There is absolutely no fact of local bullies and evil gentry taking the militia's banner to bully good people. They speak kindly and guide the villagers with sincerity, so they are all very dedicated, understand the meaning of teamwork and public interest, the lazy become diligent and thrifty, and the fierce turn into kind. From self-defense and autonomy, it is promoted to a self-sufficiency policy. The success of the Guangxi militia, in the most obvious facts, is the elimination of bandits throughout the province, the sharp reduction of beggars, and the completion of more than 30,000 li of highways. Now the self-defense power of the militia throughout the province is increasing day by day. The number of troops in Guangxi is the smallest in the country, with only five divisions, but according to military experts, the self-defense power of the province is greater than any other province, and it can resist the invasion of 500,000 of the latest type of troops. The Communist bandits who窜桂 last year were quickly wiped out, entirely by the power of the militia. Many people who went to Guangxi to visit and returned said that the Guangxi militia was indeed well organized, but most people have a kind of doubt, that is, whether the Guangxi militia training method can be extended to other provinces, especially the more affluent people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces who are used to comfort. Because Guangxi is barren and the people are poor, the people are accustomed to hard work and are absolutely able to obey orders. As long as there are leaders, they can be tightly organized and serve the public. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the situation is exactly the opposite. If hard training is implemented, requiring farmers to run dozens of miles at dawn to gather for training, and also to take on guard duty at ordinary times, and also to take time to cultivate public fields and build roads, at the beginning of implementation, there will inevitably be complaints, and the drawbacks of substitution and exile will emerge endlessly, and local tyrants and evil gentry will emerge to obstruct it, and the difficulties will be greater than in Guangxi. But the reporter's personal opinion is that as long as the leader is determined and can lead by example everywhere, to seek factual improvement and not just seek superficiality, then there is nothing difficult in the world. It is unreasonable and impossible for the militia to be successful in Guangxi but not be able to be extended to other provinces.</p>
<p>Third, from the perspective of construction work, Guangxi Province now has only more than 27 million yuan in annual income, of which 60-70% still relies on special transit taxes, so the authorities act according to their income and are very cautious. Large-scale construction projects can be said to be absolutely non-existent. If you go to Guangxi with the eyes of a big city, you will be disappointed if you want to see factories and material equipment worth tens of millions. This is exactly the opposite of the situation in Guangdong. In Guangdong, there are newly established factories worth millions of yuan, and even palace-style buildings such as the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and the municipal government have cost millions of yuan. But one thing is worthy of our praise. Although the amount of money Guangxi spends on construction is small, it is very economical. When one yuan is spent, the general public can enjoy the benefit of that one yuan. According to the places the reporter has visited, such as the livestock breeding institute, the agricultural experiment field, the tung oil refinery, the health experiment institute, and the public museum, they can all directly contact the public. The cost is not much, but the effect is great. It is enough to correct our country's problem of talking about construction and wasting money.</p>
<p>Fourth, regarding the equipment of the southwest border defense, the reporter went to Longzhou to see it once. The mountains are overlapping, and the passes are steep and dangerous. There is indeed a natural situation where one man guards the pass and ten thousand men cannot enter. At that time, Li Pinxian, the border defense superintendent, who is now the chief of staff of the Fourth Army Group, had been in office for three years and was able to revitalize border affairs and make many improvements. The training of the military militia is full of vigor. Although the defense of various important passes on the border is in the peaceful days of today, there has been no phenomenon of slackening at all. The commercial exchanges between Chinese and French merchants on the border and the joint celebrations of military and diplomatic officials from both sides can all be based on the principle of absolute equality. People who have been accustomed to being bullied go to the border and breathe the air of equality and freedom, and they really feel an unspeakable pleasure. Now Longzhou's transportation is becoming more and more convenient. There are three air flights every week, flying from Guangzhou to Wuzhou, Nanning, and Longzhou. It only takes one day to get there. There are also highways and waterways. Longzhou, which was previously regarded as a mysterious area, is now thriving in all industries, which is very different from the past. The area of the southwest border defense is full of mountains and ridges, with a sparse population. There are many miasma epidemics. Every time it is the turn of spring and summer, epidemics are prevalent, and deaths are rampant. Therefore, the number of residents is decreasing day by day, and the land is mostly barren. The reason why the border area cannot be developed is here. Currently, the Guangxi authorities are making every effort to pay attention to health administration, believing that miasma is a tropical disease and malaria, and are sending personnel to the four townships to inject prevention. There have been considerable results. In the future, we can further pay attention to the issue of immigration. The scenery of Longzhou is not inferior to Guilin. If the authorities can pay attention to cleaning it up, the future development is unlimited. Our country has always paid little attention to border defense. In 1929, the reporter went to the three northeastern provinces to inspect. The corruption of border defense in the northwest to Hailar and Manchuria was shocking. Since the September 18th Incident, it has gradually aroused the attention of the people of the country, but Ban Hong and Ban Nong are not clear, which has become a great joke. The northwest and southwest are important gateways for our country. We especially hope that the Guangxi authorities can continue to work hard and not be satisfied with the current situation, and pay as much attention as possible to the consolidation of border defense and the development of the rural economy of the border people, so that our country can resist foreign enemies and gain the first victory, and the Zhennanguan, which has unparalleled glorious value in history, will last forever with our people.</p>

By 1932, it accounted for 22% of China's imports. Regarding imported goods, kerosene, steel, machinery, cotton, and wood are the main items. Exported goods include silk, preserved eggs, plants, and seeds. The import and export balance is quite uneven. In the future, I hope that the trade between the two sides will become more balanced, taking into account the mutual interests of the two countries and the changes in actual needs, so as to seek commercial interests and closely cooperate to enhance friendship." It is heard that Thomas of the American Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed from the United States to congratulate.</p>

He will arrive here on the 25th on the President Jefferson liner of the Dollar Steamship Company. Therefore, Ambassador Johnson came to Shanghai to join Consul General Kenningham and others in Shanghai to prepare for the welcoming arrangements. However, it is known that Ghana is anxious to return home and does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long. He has asked Kenningham to decline all receptions. Johnson and others will only hold a tea party to show their welcome.</p>

<p>Duan Qirui's Life in Shanghai</p>
<p>Entertaining Himself With Buddhist Scriptures and Weiqi Every Day</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Duan Qirui, who came to Shanghai as a recluse a few years ago, has a very leisurely attitude and spends his time entertaining himself with Buddhist scriptures and Weiqi. He suffered from foot disease before, but now he has fully recovered. Yesterday, the reporter visited his residence. Duan was playing Weiqi with Weiqi masters Gu Shuiru and Wang Yunfeng. Guo You'an, a subordinate, received the reporter on his behalf and asked about Duan's life. According to him, Duan has been living in the south and does not ask about any politics. His family in Tianjin has come south since Duan was ill before. There is no real estate in Tianjin and Gu, and there is only one house in Peiping. At present, only a few gatekeepers stay there to take care of the house. Duan's daily life is to get up at 6:00 in the morning, wash, and take a walk in the garden, and then have breakfast. Because he likes Buddhism all his life, he reads Buddhist scriptures for an hour after meals, and then plays Weiqi with his close friends. After lunch, he takes a nap to rest his mind, and then meets guests if there is anything to do, and plays Weiqi if there is nothing to do, which has become a routine. Even most of the visitors are rejected and not seen. As for his foot disease, it is rheumatism accumulated in the army when he was young, and it often occurs when he gets old. If he encounters abnormal weather, he will also suffer a little pain, but it is not a big deal. Duan Zihonggang was recently sent to Anqing to invigilate the examination. Duan is 71 years old this year. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek built a house in Huangshan and invited Duan to live there. At that time, it was just to use the beautiful scenery of Huangshan as a summer resort in the hot summer. However, the weather is cold now, and the house has not been completed yet, so he will never go to Anhui to live there.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Zhejiang Construction Department Secretary Wang Yingbin Discusses the Promotion of the Cotton Industry in Zhejiang Province: This Year, Over 120,070 Mu of Cotton Fields Were Promoted, and the Results of Improved Cotton Varieties Are Significant, with Further Expansion Planned for Next Year <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports: The Construction Department of Zhejiang Province has spared no effort in promoting various construction projects in recent years. The construction of highways and the commencement of the Qiantang River Bridge have facilitated transportation. In recent years, attention has been focused on rural construction, such as promoting cooperative farming, and improving the silk and cotton industries. The work related to cotton industry improvement is mainly handled by the Cotton Industry Management Office of the department. Its main task is to promote improved cotton varieties to meet the needs of domestic textile production. The quality of Zhejiang cotton is poor, and the fibers are too short. The annual production can only supply daily household use. Last year, the provincial government allocated a large sum to promote improved varieties. As the cotton planting and sales season comes to an end, the province's improvements have been quite effective. We met with Mr. Wang Yingbin, Secretary of the Zhejiang Construction Department and Director of the Cotton Industry Management Office, during his business trip to Shanghai. Our reporter paid a special visit to inquire about the details of the process, which are described as follows:</p>
<p>Many Difficulties During the Promotion Period</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, the large-scale promotion of the cotton industry in Zhejiang Province only began last year. Fortunately, this year's harvest is quite satisfactory. In total, the area of improved cotton fields reached 120,074 mu. Considering the land area of Zhejiang Province, the scope is not small. The work process was quite arduous. Cotton brokers, bound by traditional ideas, had doubts, opposition, and resistance to the improvement of the cotton industry. However, the provincial department had long-term trials of improved cotton varieties. The purpose was to seek benefits for cotton farmers and increase national production. The Management Office could only devote all its efforts to it. In addition to training and guiding more than 50 people before the event, and assigning them to various experimental areas to implement instructions and persuasion, the advantages of improved cotton and the results of historical experiments were compiled into small booklets in simple language and distributed for publicity to facilitate promotion. Although the results were good, there were also many misunderstandings. Some cotton farmers gathered crowds to destroy the offices of experimental stations, some scolded and insulted instructors, and some even resorted to violence. Some used local newspapers to attack in writing. However, the Management Office, bearing the mission of improving rural areas, had to use various methods to vigorously promote it.</p>
<p>Three Aspects Hindered Improvement</p>
<p>The reasons for the cotton farmers' obstruction were lack of common sense and greed for petty gains. In the past, the quantity of cotton harvested was arbitrarily falsely reported to reduce rental payments. Since the government was in charge, it was necessary to report truthfully, so they were unwilling to change varieties. Or they believed that although the quality of improved cotton was better, under the government's guidance, tax collection was inevitable, so they held conservative attitudes and did not seek improvement. The reasons for the obstruction by cotton brokers were that they could no longer issue high-interest loans to farmers. Generally, farmers, tempted by the availability of money to borrow and rice to buy on credit, often owed a lot to the cotton brokers. If farmers accepted improvements, the cotton brokers would inevitably force them to repay their debts. Therefore, the general farmers, under the instruction of the cotton brokers, rose up to oppose the improvements. As for the cotton field landlords, their cotton fields were usually managed by local bullies, who were often managers of cotton brokers. Thus, they spread rumors such as the government's unified collection of cotton was unfavorable to the cotton field landlords. All of these things hindered the improvement of cotton planting.</p>
<p>Slight Twists and Turns Were Smoothed Out by Persuasion</p>
<p>The reason why the office was able to solve various obstacles in the past was that it was able to obtain the cooperation of the county magistrates of various counties, who went to the countryside together for persuasive guidance. It was also fortunate to receive support from gentry and gentlemen such as Mr. Yu Qiaqing, so the cotton farmers were relieved to receive seeds and sow. However, it took a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Purchasing Seeds and Distributing for Planting</p>
<p>The office promoted improved cotton varieties. In addition to the million cotton seeds supplied by the Zhejiang Cotton Field, all the acclimatized American cotton seeds were purchased by me from Zhengzhou and other places and distributed to various planting areas. The purchase price was quite high. Although we were fortunate to have the Ministry of Railways reduce the freight charges to four yuan per dan, farmers used local cotton seeds worth one yuan to exchange for improved seeds, so the provincial government's loss on seeds was already considerable.</p>
<p>Number of Mu Promoted and Cotton Seed Areas</p>
<p>The promotion area is divided into six implementation areas and two cooperative cotton fields. The promoted area totals 120,074 mu, of which 63,181 mu are planted with million cotton, and 56,893 mu are planted with acclimatized cotton. The distribution of each area can be divided into the following table:</p>
<p>Area Cotton Field Area (Mu) Cotton Variety</p>
<p>Xiaoshan Cotton Industry Improvement Implementation Area 24,248 Million Cotton</p>
<p>Yuyao Cotton Industry Improvement Implementation Area 29,502 Stone Weir Million Cotton 23,672 Mu Xinpu Coast Acclimatized American Cotton 5,830 Mu</p>
<p>Hang County Cotton Industry Improvement Implementation Area 15,261 Million Cotton</p>
<p>Zhenhai Cotton Industry Improvement Implementation Area 26,524 Acclimatized American Cotton</p>
<p>Cixi Cotton Industry Improvement Implementation Area 19,678 Acclimatized American Cotton</p>
<p>Haiyan Cotton Industry Improvement Implementation Area 3,150 Acclimatized American Cotton</p>
<p>Yinxian Cooperative Cotton Field 1,209 Acclimatized American Cotton</p>
<p>Dinghai Cooperative Cotton Field 502 Acclimatized American Cotton</p>
<p>Improved Cotton Varieties Outperform Local Cotton</p>
<p>The improvement work in each area is guided by instructors appointed by the office. All planting processes must be reported in a timely manner. From the statistics, it is known that the yield of million cotton and acclimatized American cotton is generally higher than that of local cotton. The increase in yield per mu averages 70 to 80 jin, and the minimum increase is also 20 to 30 jin. The average price of million cotton and acclimatized cotton is also higher than that of local cotton. From these statistics, it can be seen that the improved seeds have achieved the desired effect. Cotton farmers should have nothing to say at this point. A comparison of the yield and price per mu of improved cotton and local cotton is detailed in the following table:</p>
<p>Improved Cotton Yield and Price per Mu Local Cotton Yield and Price County Highest Lowest Average Price Highest Lowest Average Price</p>
<p>Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin</p>
<p>Xiaoshan 125 80 101 9.50 35 17.3 28.2 8.80</p>
<p>Yuyao 150 100 120 1.00 21 30 70 8.90</p>

<p>Experimental Cotton Areas All Reported Bumper Harvests</p>
<p>When Mr. Jiang spoke to this point, the reporter asked because he had seen a report in the newspaper a few days ago about the national cotton production statistics released by the National Cotton Control Association, which said that Zhejiang Province's harvest this year was only 20%. According to Mr. Wang, the statement that Zhejiang Province's harvest this year was only 20% may be incorrect. Even in the experimental area of the improved cotton fields of the office, although it was not a bumper harvest, the gains were more than 20%. In the Hang County area, excessive fertilization led to particularly lush branches and leaves, coupled with excessive rainfall, resulting in a lower yield than in other areas. However, this is a special situation. Compared with the yield of local cotton in the same area, it is still 10 to 20 jin higher. If the entire province's production is statistically analyzed, the harvest of improved cotton is at least between 50% and 60%, and local cotton is also between 40% and 50%.</p>

<p>And invites him to return to China for a visit</p>

<p>Ministry of Communications Dispatches a Large Number of Trainees, Designating Them to Serve in the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Bureau is currently undergoing downsizing and austerity measures. Yesterday, it suddenly received an order from the ministry dispatching 18 trainees to the bureau, designating them to serve in various departments, branches, and on various ships. During the internship period, each person receives a monthly salary of 40 yuan. Upon completion of the internship, efforts will be made to employ them as a priority. Those with excellent performance will receive higher compensation. The allocation of positions and the names of the trainees are recorded below: Business Department: Xia Jixi, Shipbuilding Department: Ye Shiyi, South Branch: Geng Ying, Central Branch: Liu Xinyi, North Branch: Meng Chuming, China Branch: Chen Zhiyuan, New Branch: Yao Tie, Beijing Branch: Luo Shengyuan, Hankou Branch: Ma Zichao, Xie Haiquan, Wuhu Branch: Wang Liheng, Xunyang Branch: Xu Jun, Anhui Branch: Wu Junli, Jiang Jing, Gong Kuangsheng, Hai Yan, Zhang Chunsen, Xin Ming, Cheng Zhemian, Xinhe: Yang Heji, Xin Jiangtian, Ao Benkai.</p>
<p>The Ministry Approves Banks and Native Banks to Receive Legal Tender, Which Will Facilitate Turnover After Implementation</p>
<p>The method of receiving legal tender still follows the old precedent of 60% cash and 40% bonds. The two industry associations have notified members to comply.</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports: After the Ministry of Finance ordered the silver and native banks associations to receive legal tender in accordance with the original method of receiving notes, the banks and native banks have all proceeded in accordance with the regulations. The market has become more active. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Silver and Native Banks Receive Legal Tender</p>
<p>After the notes of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank were designated as legal tender, the secret notes of the three banks were gradually withdrawn, which greatly affected the business of small banks and native banks that used the secret notes to conduct important business. They had to change their business policies. Now, in order to invigorate the market and facilitate the business of various banks and native banks, the Ministry of Finance has approved the receipt of legal tender in accordance with the original method of receiving notes. The silver and native banks associations have notified members to comply and have posted public notices in the market to inform the public. The various banks and native banks have all complied with the order to receive legal tender from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The Market Becomes Active After Implementation</p>
<p>According to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, for example, Article 2 of the Regulations of the Preparation Inspection Committee for the Issuance of Bank of China Notes stipulates that Bank of China exchange notes are divided into three types: issued by the bank, received by joint banks, and received by various banks and native banks. All have sufficient cash reserves of 60%, with the remaining 40% in other forms. The receipt of notes by various banks and native banks remains the same as before. Now, when banks and native banks receive legal tender from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank, they still use 60% cash and 40% public bonds or treasury bills. The discounted price of public bonds and treasury bills is handled according to the previous regulations of the three banks. After implementation, the market has become more active.</p>
<h3 id="e105">National Oil Mills Decide to Resume Operations on the 25th, and Will Fully Resume Operations After the Bran Tax is Abolished. The Two-Month-Long Dispute Comes to a Temporary End. <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Da Gong News Agency reports: At 3:00 PM yesterday, grain and oil cake factory operators and merchants held a joint meeting with representatives in a restaurant on MinGuo Road. Attendees included She Bingwen, Chen Shide, Ye Tingfan, Chen Ziyi, Zheng Zenan, Cai Yukun, Liu Liugu, Zhang Shushu, Xu Shili, Guo Yousheng, Zhu Zixiang, Fu Changyu, Yan Xiaoquan (represented by Pan Zhenyu), Luo Rongzhou (represented by Wu Yifu), Chen Yunqing, He Quansheng, Chen Bingheng (Cao Xingeng, Qian Baoting, He Xianggu, and over twenty others). Gu Xinyi chaired the meeting, and Kong Rulin recorded the minutes.</p>
<p>Resume Operations First</p>
<p>First, the chairman reported the purpose of the joint meeting. Then, Chen Ziyi, a standing committee member of the oil mill association and representative of the petitioners, reported the process of petitioning the Fifth National Congress to abolish the bran tax (details omitted). The discussion then began, and it was resolved that the industry's sales in Guangdong were blocked before the bran tax was abolished, and it was impossible to resume operations based on the factual situation. However, the central government's intention should be highly respected. Therefore, it was decided that a portion of the industry would resume operations on the 25th of this month. Only after the authorities issued a clear order to abolish the tax could all operations be resumed. Detailed discussions were also held on all internal work related to the resumption of operations. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Notify All Factories</p>
<p>After the joint meeting of grain and oil cake factory operators and merchants resolved to resume operations on a specific date, the association immediately transcribed the resolution and notified the grain oil factories to implement it on schedule. According to the Da Gong News Agency reporter, the pressing machines in various oil pressing factories in the city have been idle for a long time and need to be repaired for three or four days before they can be put into operation. More than 7,000 oil workers returned to their hometowns after the shutdown. Now, each factory is separately trying to notify them to come to Shanghai to work.</p>

<p>The Nanyang Overseas Chinese General Chamber of Commerce previously held a national goods exhibition in the Singapore Great World, which has already closed. Wang Zhisheng, the representative sent by the Shanghai National Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and a delegation of more than ten manufacturers' representatives returned to China on the French postal ship Datnan. They entered the port at 8:00 PM last night and landed at the China Merchants Bureau Central Pier. It is reported that this national exhibition was well received in Singapore, and the samples of goods brought by various manufacturers were sold out, indicating that the sales of Chinese goods in the markets of various islands in Nanyang only need to be developed with effort, and the future is still unlimited.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Temporary Smoking Cessation Hospital is Scheduled to be Established for Three Months, and a Budget Proposal is Being Submitted to the Municipal Government for Approval <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The First Crackdown Achieved Significant Results by the Deadline</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau previously, in order to prevent citizens applying for self-smoking cessation from using the name of self-smoking cessation while still privately smoking opium, a practice with serious abuses, specially requested the Health Bureau to designate testing hospitals, including the Southeast Hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, and more than twenty other locations. It was stipulated that those who could afford to pay the fees should go to the designated hospitals for testing, provide a certificate, and submit a written guarantee not to smoke opium again for the record. Those who could not afford to pay the fees would be sent to the drug rehabilitation center for testing. It is reported that many citizens in the city who applied for self-smoking cessation followed the order and voluntarily went to the designated hospitals for testing. The Public Security Bureau also stipulated that if it was found that they were smoking again, they would be sent to the drug rehabilitation center for testing to prevent fraud.</p>
<p>The Smoking Cessation Hospital Will Be Established for Three Months</p>
<p>Regarding the temporary smoking cessation hospital, according to Dai Lizhen, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau, the matter has been discussed by the Public Security and Health Bureaus, and it has been decided to use the Gaoging Temple Memorial New Village as the hospital site. The establishment period is three months, and the Health Bureau is drafting a budget proposal, which will be jointly submitted by the two bureaus to the Municipal Government for instructions, and will be implemented after approval.</p>
<p>The First Crackdown Ends Today</p>
<p>The first crackdown on compulsory registration of smokers has been underway for several days since its commencement. The result of persuasion and registration is that a considerable number of smokers have realized their mistakes and surrendered voluntarily. Uncooperative and defiant bad elements who dared to deceive and evade have been arrested and severely punished. The Public Security Bureau officials in charge stated that the first crackdown on smoking offenders in the city will, on the one hand, give smokers who were originally good citizens but mistakenly went astray an opportunity to become aware of their mistakes and make renewed efforts, adding a useful person to society. On the other hand, the arrest of insidious and cunning troublemakers who evade registration will have a significant deterrent effect. Therefore, the first crackdown has achieved significant results. It is now scheduled to end today, and the second crackdown will be scheduled later.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Appeal Documents Should Be Submitted to the Court of First Instance <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Procuratorate of the First Special District Court Issues a Public Notice Explaining that They Should Not Be Submitted Directly to the Court of Appeal</p>
<p>The Procuratorate of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court issued a public notice yesterday, stating: For the purpose of public notice, the Shanghai Jiangsu High Court Second Branch Procuratorate issued Instruction Jian Zi No. 141, which forwarded the Supreme Court Procuratorate Instruction Ping Zi No. 2610, which stated: In cases of appeal to the Supreme Court, the appeal or reasoning documents should be submitted to the court of first instance in accordance with the law, and should not be mistakenly presented directly to the Supreme Court Procuratorate. The relevant legal provisions and points to be noted should be explained in detail and widely publicized. Therefore, after investigation, Article 342, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "To file an appeal, an appeal document shall be submitted to the court of first instance." The so-called court of first instance refers to the court of original judgment. When appealing to the High Court or its branch, the Local Court is the court of first instance. When appealing to the Supreme Court, the High Court or its branch is the court of first instance. Furthermore, Article 374, Paragraph 1 of the same law stipulates that "The appeal document shall state the reasons for the appeal. If the reasons are not stated, a written statement of reasons shall be submitted to the court of first instance within ten days after the appeal is filed." Since this article is stipulated in the chapter on the third instance of the same law, the so-called court of first instance specifically refers to the High Court or its branch. Furthermore, to file an appeal, the appeal document shall be submitted to the court of first instance within ten days after the service of the judgment, as stipulated in Articles 341 and 342 of the same law. If the appeal document for appeal to the third instance does not state the reasons, a written statement of reasons shall be submitted to the court of first instance within ten days after the appeal is filed, as clearly stipulated in Article 374 of the same law. All of these are the legal procedures regarding appeal. If the appeal document is not submitted within the statutory period, or the written statement of reasons is not submitted to the court of first instance, or even if it is submitted to the court of appeal within the statutory period, but not submitted to the court of first instance, resulting in a delay of the appeal period before it is submitted to the court of first instance, all of these violate the statutory procedures and will be subject to the court's ruling to dismiss the appeal, as clearly stipulated in Articles 376 and 387 of the Criminal Procedure Law. In accordance with the foregoing instruction, the above articles are hereby explained and publicized for general knowledge. The parties concerned must pay special attention to the above-mentioned statutory procedures in the future. When filing an appeal, the appeal document shall be submitted to the court of first instance and shall not be submitted directly to the court of appeal, in order to comply with the procedures and safeguard the right to sue. This is of utmost importance. This is a public notice.</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Ministry of Interior Consults with Provincial and Municipal Governments to Consider Pilot Programs for Female Police Officers <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior believes that training women as police officers has long been recognized as effective by the League of Nations Committee on Trafficking in Women and Children, which has advised member states to adopt it. It has also resolved to urge countries without female police officers to try pilot programs. In the past, there have been no such female police officers in China. In recent years, as social interactions between men and women have gradually become more open and social conditions have become increasingly complex, ignorant women in domestic commercial metropolises are inevitably exploited by others to commit crimes, thereby endangering public security. If the patrol depends solely on male police officers, it is difficult to be thorough. In order to cope with the social environment, it is necessary to establish female police officers. The Capital Police Department and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau have successively piloted female inspectors, which have already achieved remarkable results. Therefore, other provinces and cities should follow up and establish them to meet environmental needs and maintain social tranquility. The Police Administration Department has formulated concrete measures and sent them to provincial and municipal governments, instructing their subordinate police agencies at all levels to consider the situation in their respective jurisdictions and try to implement them.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The China Merchants Bureau's Newly Built Upstream Vessels Will Be Put Out to Tender, Each Vessel Costing Approximately 300,000 Yuan <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Bureau is using the balance of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to add a new Yangtze River vessel and two upstream fuel-powered motor engine vessels, each with a capacity of 500 tons. The hull materials must be purchased from the United Kingdom and transported to Shanghai, where they will be assembled by shipyards in Shanghai. The bureau will raise the remaining funds separately. The drawings and applied materials for these three vessels have been provided by the bureau and sent to shipyards in Shanghai for bidding. However, the current exchange rate of gold pounds has risen by 40% to 50% compared to the time of bidding, so the price of materials for the three vessels has also increased accordingly. It is now certain that the tenders for the two upstream motor vessels have been submitted by various shipyards to the bureau, where they will be examined by the New Vessel Committee and the Chief Shipowner's Shipbuilding Department. A decision on the winning shipyard will be made in about a week. The purchase of materials has also been ordered. The price of each vessel has increased by one-third compared to the original bidding price, costing approximately 300,000 yuan per vessel, totaling 600,000 gold yuan for the two vessels. The official bidding papers will be selected in one week and submitted to the ministry for approval. The construction will then be ordered. The bidding papers for the new Yangtze River vessel have been scheduled to be opened on January 15th of next year.</p>

<p>Designing and Installing Fire Hydrants</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that the Pudong jurisdiction is vast and densely populated, and special attention should be paid to the fire fighting equipment in the area. Before the Xingye Trust Company established the Pudong Waterworks, it was difficult to connect water pipes, so the installation of fire hydrants was quite hesitant. Now that the Pudong Waterworks has been established, the difficult problem of connecting water pipes has been resolved. The bureau is now ordering Dong, the fire fighting section chief, to work with the Pudong Fire Brigade to actively design and expedite the installation of fire hydrants and fire fighting equipment in the Pudong area, so that the installation can be completed in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the fire fighting equipment in Pudong will be more complete and thorough than before.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Head Chef of a Warship Arrested for Private Possession of Silver Coins <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance of the National Government promulgated the regulations prohibiting the export of silver currency, customs officers have repeatedly seized violators, but the amounts were only between 100 to 200 yuan and 300 to 400 yuan. However, last month, over 1,700 yuan in silver dollars were seized on a warship of a certain country. The person who privately carried the money was Tan Shiquan, the head chef of the warship (commonly known as the chief purser). On October 5th of this year, the warship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. After arriving at the port, customs officer Gu Renmin boarded the ship for inspection as usual and seized 1,300 Hong Kong silver coins from Tan. The captain of the ship proved that the money was for purchasing goods, so he was exempt from further investigation. On the morning of the 7th, customs officer Wang went to the ship for inspection again and seized 1,400 Chinese silver coins from Tan's bedroom. The silver coins were taken to the customs for confiscation. At the same time, the water police station dispatched detective Huang Songsheng to arrest Tan and send him to the local court's prosecutor's office for questioning. He was prosecuted in the criminal court for obstructing the national currency. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Wu Deying opened the court for interrogation. First, customs officer Gu Renmin and others stated the circumstances of the seizure. Tan Shiquan, who was in custody, stated that he was 16 years old and from Guangdong. The silver dollars were owed by the sailors of the warship for food and goods. After the ship arrived in Shanghai and received wages, the goods were repaid. He was intercepted by the customs officer and had no desire to profit. Moreover, the warship was ordered to be stationed in Shanghai and would not sail elsewhere. He asked for leniency. The judge ordered a second hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Following the city-wide scout fundraising mobilization for flood relief, which began on the 9th, with two days for external fundraising and a week for internal fundraising, concluding on the 17th, the collected donations have been successively submitted to the City Scout Council. Council staff have been working tirelessly, day and night, to count the submissions and verify the donation tickets, even during holidays.

Among the submitted donations, Minzhi Middle School stands out with 1,192 yuan and 73 cents, achieving the best results. Due to the complexity of calculating ratios and individual scores, it is difficult to compile statistics at this time. Once all group report cards and donations have been submitted, calculations will be combined and announced. It is reported that the Council has urged all groups that have not yet submitted to do so by 4 PM yesterday, along with their member performance reports, for final settlement. According to Council Secretary Luo Lie, the success of this scout fundraising effort has exceeded expectations. The amount of donations received, as of 5 PM the day before yesterday, has surpassed all previous public fundraising records. Although there were as many as 6,000 participants this time, to gather this amount in the current depressed market to help disaster victims is no easy feat. The generosity of people from all walks of life and their acts of kindness are truly unforgettable.</p>

<p>Zhang Mingqin, Chief of the Pudong Public Security Bureau, was ordered to prepare for winter defense matters in Pudong. He specially invited leaders of relevant local organizations and groups to a joint winter defense meeting in the bureau's hall at 7 PM the night before last. In addition to the bureau's entire staff, representatives from the Yangjing District Security Corps, Tangqiao District Security Corps, Gaochang Luchisi Various District Security Corps, Gaoqiao Sub-bureau, Machine Gun Company, Jijia Ferry, Tangqiao, Yangjing, Donggou, various police stations, as well as Pudong, Yangjing District, various fire brigades, the electric company, municipal ferry office, Public Works Bureau, telephone bureau, Pudong Hospital, and others, including Xu Ming, Pan Zhiwen, Zhang Shangzhen, Tang Jinghuan, Yang Zhongquan, Zhang Sheng, and dozens more, attended.

<p>The Health Bureau Strictly Prohibits Fraud</p>
<p>All municipal smoking cessation institutions in this city consistently provide free services to inpatients undergoing treatment, without charging any fees. However, a woman went to the Shanghai Municipal Hunan Smoking Cessation Hospital on the 8th of this month and claimed that "On the 7th of this month, an unfamiliar man came to her home, saying that her husband, Liu Ada, was undergoing smoking cessation treatment at the Nanshi Smoking Cessation Hospital and had now broken his addiction and would soon be discharged. He said that he was a former patient and that Liu Ada had asked him to collect four silver dollars from her home to send to the hospital so that Liu could use them for his discharge transportation and for expenses for the hospital staff. I believed him to be true and managed to pay a total of four dollars to him to send to my husband. Therefore, I came to the hospital today to inquire if my husband had received the money," etc. The hospital stated that it not only does not charge any fees according to regulations, but also that after investigation, there was no Liu Ada among the inpatients undergoing smoking cessation. In the midst of this city's strict ban on smoking, unscrupulous villains are actually taking advantage of the situation to commit fraud, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, the hospital reported the situation to the Health Bureau for strict investigation and prevention. After receiving the report, the bureau not only replied to the hospital but also made it a point to strictly prohibit such acts, so as to prevent future troubles.</p>

<p>Departed for Ningbo Last Night to Avoid Celebrations; Will Return to Shanghai Tomorrow Morning; Birthday Celebrations to Aid Disaster Relief Expected to Total Around 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Today is the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Lin Kanghou, a renowned banker in China. Some time ago, Mr. Lin's friends and colleagues asked to celebrate his birthday, but Mr. Lin, feeling that it was inappropriate to celebrate during this time of disaster when there were countless victims, declined modestly. As a result, Kong Xiangxi, Xu Shiying, and other prominent figures, a total of fifty-four people, jointly initiated a "Mr. Lin Kanghou's Sixtieth Birthday Celebration to Aid Disaster Relief." To avoid the celebrations on his birthday today, Mr. Lin specially took a boat to Ningbo last night for a short trip and will return to Shanghai tomorrow morning. A banquet will still be held at his residence on Shangwen Road to entertain guests. Mr. Lin's given name is Zujin, and he is from Shanghai. He is known for his loyalty, kindness, tranquility, and detachment, and his accomplishments and virtues are known throughout the country. The Bank Association on Hong Kong Road and the Yunnan Road Renji Hall Water Disaster Relief Association have already collected the first batch of congratulatory gifts, which were distributed to the disaster areas earlier this month, totaling approximately 3,000 yuan. The total is expected to be around 5,000 yuan.</p>

According to his will, his body will be cremated and his ashes mixed with flour and thrown into the sea. His eldest son, Mr. Qi Zaiyu, who works at the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, rushed to Suzhou upon hearing the news. On the 15th, he followed Buddhist rituals to enshrine the body in a coffin, and on the 16th, the coffin was taken to the body-offering kiln at Lingyan Mountain in Mutuo. The cremation is scheduled for half-past two tomorrow morning (the 21st). The general office of the Chinese Buddhist Association in this city decided at its 16th standing committee meeting the day before yesterday to hold a memorial service at Jueyuan on Hed Road at 10 AM tomorrow, with offerings and chanting throughout the day to commemorate him. His family will hold a family memorial service outside the South Gate of Jiaxing on the 4th of next month. It is also said that the master's former friends, considering the master's significant contributions to the Buddhist cause and his indelible merits, have proposed preserving his ashes and building a pagoda in the sacred land of West Lake to perpetuate his memory. The site selection and design are currently underway, and construction is expected to begin at the end of the year. A large-scale public burial ceremony will be held at that time, and a commemorative album will be published to pay tribute. According to records, the master's secular surname was Qi, his given name was Zezhou, and his Dharma name was Mingdao. He was from Jiaxing, Zhejiang. In the late Qing Dynasty, he studied at the Japanese Police Academy. After returning to China, he engaged in revolutionary activities with Chu Fucheng and others. He made great contributions to the restoration of Qing provinces. He served as the county magistrate of Tongxiang, Deqing, and Linhai in Zhejiang Province and Lingxiao County in Fujian Province. In middle age, he converted to Buddhism and specialized in the Pure Land Sect. He was tonsured in the fourteenth year of the Republic and served as a standing director of the National Buddhist Association, traveling extensively and tirelessly. He suffered from a liver ailment a month ago, which ultimately led to his death at the age of fifty-five. He had two sons and three daughters. During his lifetime, he studied Buddhism extensively and wrote many works, which are scattered in various places and have not been compiled. The Buddhist Association and his sons plan to collect the master's writings and compile them into a volume to commemorate him. If anyone has any of the master's writings, whether fragments or full pieces, they can be sent directly to the general office of the Chinese Buddhist Association on Hed Road in this city or to Qi Zaiyu at the Wuxiandian Radio Station on Minguo Road.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Junkang Small Money Exchange House Closed Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Promissory Notes Issued Will Be Returned to Original Issuer</p>
<p>Junkang Small Money Exchange House in the French Concession of Baxianqiao, with a capital of approximately 20,000 yuan, was forced to suspend operations and liquidate yesterday due to the impact of the poor market. Attorney Gong Tongyuan was entrusted to issue a notice stating, "According to Junkang Zhuang's manager, the exchange house has recently been affected by the poor market conditions, which has made it impossible to recover various outstanding loans in a timely manner, resulting in a financial crunch and making it difficult to maintain operations. Reluctantly, we have no choice but to entrust your law firm to issue a public notice stating that, from today, business will be temporarily suspended. All customer deposits have been gradually returned in the days leading up to the publication of this notice. As for the promissory notes issued by the exchange house, please return them to the previous holder for processing." Based on this, this lawyer is issuing this public notice on behalf of the exchange house. Your attention is appreciated. The law office is located at No. 7 Binchang Lane, Menghua Street, Laozhaimen.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Candle Industry Requests French Municipal Council to Correct Fines <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Candle Industry Trade Association of this city recently expressed outrage at the French Concession Municipal Council's unwarranted fines imposed on its member Zhizhonghe Store and unanimously requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to argue the case based on reason. The original letter is as follows: "Respectfully informing you, we have recently received a letter from our member Zhizhonghe Store on Jixiang Street, stating that on the 14th of this month, a Western police officer from the French Public Works Bureau, upon seeing firecrackers displayed in the store window, deemed them unsalable and ordered them to be stored away. Although our store knew that the concession authorities had not previously issued any such prohibition, we had no choice but to comply and immediately stored the firecrackers to avoid further trouble. However, the next day, the Public Works Bureau suddenly sent a patrolman to the store to demand a fine of one yuan, and issued a receipt. This was a strange and perplexing matter. Our store has been operating in the concession for many years. Even during martial law in previous years, firecrackers and other similar items were never prohibited from being displayed in the store. Even if such interference were permissible, our compliance in storing the firecrackers should have been sufficient. Why impose a fine in addition? Moreover, firecrackers are legitimate items used for celebrations during festivals. Except during periods of alert, there is no reason for a long-term ban. Now that there is no clear prohibition and the fine is unwarranted, how can law-abiding merchants feel secure in their businesses? Therefore, we respectfully write to your Chamber, requesting that you argue the case with the French Public Works Bureau, seeking a clear explanation and a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. This is deeply appreciated."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Municipal Federation Submits Request to Social Affairs Bureau to Restrict Silver Coin Exchange Rate <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced on the 4th of this month that the banknotes of the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications would be designated as legal tender, it immediately set the legal tender exchange rate, stipulating that each legal tender could be exchanged for 300 copper coins and 12 jiao coins. However, small money exchange houses and tobacco shops in this city, in addition to exchanging copper coins at a rate of 297-298 per yuan, are experiencing a great shortage of silver dollars on the market. Yesterday, the exchange rate was only 10 jiao and 27-28 copper coins for each legal tender. Each double dime was exchanged for 48-49 copper coins in the Shanghai West area, 49 or 50 copper coins in the British Concession area, and 52 copper coins in the French Concession area. Based on the lowest exchange rate, one yuan of legal tender would lose more than 300 copper coins when exchanged for jiao coins and copper coins.</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city submitted an urgent request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, asking them to crack down on the practice of merchants hoarding silver coins and to address the highly uneven exchange rates displayed in the market. The original request stated, "Regarding the urgent request, since the Ministry of Finance issued the announcement on the reform of the currency system on the 3rd of this month, there was a brief period of chaos in the market, but it was short-lived and quickly returned to normal. However, unscrupulous merchants have been engaging in greedy and despicable practices. Recently, there have been rumors of hoarding silver coins, resulting in highly uneven exchange rates displayed by tobacco and exchange businesses in the market, gradually decreasing from the stipulated price of 12 jiao to below 11 jiao, and sometimes even 10 jiao and 300 copper coins. The implementation of legal tender has initially stabilized the people's hearts, but unscrupulous merchants dare to create this chaotic market, disrupting people's minds. This must be cracked down on urgently. We hereby submit this request to your bureau, urging you to work with the Public Security Bureau to restrict market prices, stabilize people's minds, and severely crack down on criminals to get to the root of the problem. Whether this is appropriate or not is subject to your approval."</p>

<p>The Cypress Wax Industry Trade Association of this city convened a representative meeting the day before yesterday, with more than ten representatives, including He Yinsheng, in attendance. Mr. He was elected as the chairman. Mr. He began by reporting that the bills from Hankou dealers still used the old Baowen custom and added the names Daiping and Xiaoping, and that the Weng's office in Tianjin increased the weight of two catties of wood, making it difficult to bear. He asked for a public decision. After discussion, it was decided that the association would again write to the dealers, requesting that they eliminate the old practices. The original letter is as follows: "Respectfully informing you, we received your letter on the 10th of this month, stating that the intention of the seller is to cancel the weight of two catties of virtual wood, and that the stone is still measured according to the old custom, distinguishing between light and heavy. Your association convened its members some time ago and discussed the matter repeatedly. It was unanimously agreed that if the Hankou letter wants to use weights, it should uniformly use the nationally recognized market weights, and the weights of (Jing), (Jin), (Ma), and (Chai Gui) should all use market weights, and the silver standard should be immediately abolished and replaced with legal tender for calculation, in order to emphasize compliance with the law. The names Daiping and Xiaoping should also be abolished to avoid complications. Please reply separately. The record is on file. Based on the above reasons, we are sending this record for your information and request that you forward it to your members for deliberation and a reply." (Remainder omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e123">Domestic New Life Adhesive Plaster Introduced <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's decision to nationalize silver has been a great boon to domestic goods. Shanghai Fuli Lilu New Life Chemical Manufacturing Factory, seeing the sharp rise in gold prices and the increase in prices of imported goods, has urgently manufactured and launched its domestic adhesive plaster, which it has been painstakingly researching for over a year. Adhesive plaster is a necessary item in medicine, and even families need to keep it on hand. What is currently available on the market is all imported. Although some domestic manufacturers produced it in previous years, they ultimately failed due to poor quality. New Life has learned from this experience and has specially hired chemical experts to conduct thorough research. After more than a year of testing, it has been completely successful. It has been certified and recommended by prominent physicians such as Gu Yuqi, Zeng Xuanbi, Shen Shubao, and Jin Wenqi. Major pharmacies in Shanghai, such as Wuzhou, Sino-Western, Sino-French, and Jicheng, have offered to sell it. Its price is much cheaper than imported goods, which can save hospitals, military doctors, clinics, and others a considerable amount of money. In the midst of this national crisis, this is good news for the medical community. The factory also has a kind of five-color, low-priced rubber adhesive tape, specially designed for industrial use to seal bottles and cans. This kind of tape is not available on the market. The factory's product can not only isolate the contents of bottles and cans from the air, but also increase their aesthetics, which is a great contribution to the industrial community. It is reported that the factory's distribution center is currently located at No. 88 Nanjing Road.</p>

<p>The insurance industry is still in its infancy in our country. Many people in society are still unfamiliar with it, and there are even fewer specialized books available for those who are interested in exploring it.

<p>Respectfully informing you, upon reading the "Local News" column in your newspaper on November 19, regarding the conversation between the Shanghai Telephone Company's chief engineer and our bureau's chief engineer Yu, I found that it was inconsistent with the facts. I am sending this letter to you to check and correct it promptly to dispel public doubts. Sincerely, Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, Ministry of Communications, November 19. Respectfully informing you, I have checked the news report on the test flight of the Sino-French Joint Airline of China Aviation Co., Ltd. published in your newspaper on the 17th of this month. It was said to be a contribution from the Shanghai New Sound News Agency. After reading it, I was shocked. The reporter of the agency only inquired with the head of the business group of our company, Director Huang, about when the route would open. Unexpectedly, the reporter of the agency would arbitrarily exaggerate, resulting in the facts being completely inconsistent. I have sent a letter to the agency asking them to pay attention, and I am also writing to you to request a correction to avoid confusion. Sincerely, China Aviation Co., Ltd., 24.11.19</p>
<p>Respectfully informing you, I was surprised to read the news in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on November 19th about the opening of the Shanghai West National Products Exhibition organized by the National Products Manufacturers Association.

Sincerely, Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, November 19.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Li Changrong and Others Trafficking Narcotics with Five Locations <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Li and others escaped upon hearing the news; three offenders arrested and awaiting sentencing.</p>
<p>Wang Shidong, a Chinese detective of the Xinzha patrol, had previously received a tip from an informant and arrested Zhang Wangshi, a woman from Wuxi, for selling red pills. Several thousand red pills were seized on the spot. After rigorous interrogation at the police station, she confessed that the narcotics were entrusted to her by Li Changrong, Wang Shunfa, and others from No. 1 Sun Temple, Sun Lane, Zhabei, to be smuggled to No. 10 Gaozhao Lane, Xinzha Road, in the Public Concession, and handed over to Xu Guihe, Li Changrong's concubine, for resale. Upon receiving this information, the police immediately dispatched detectives to search No. 10 Gaozhao Lane, where they found only Xu Guihe's younger brother, Xu Jinfa, as Xu Guihe had gone out. Xu Jinfa was taken into custody and, after repeated questioning, confessed that his sister, Xu Guihe, was currently at Peide Lane, Xinzha Road. The detectives rushed to wait for her and soon spotted her at the intersection of Carter Road. They arrested Xu and took her back to the police station along with Xu Jinfa. An investigation revealed that Li Changrong and Wang Shunfa's narcotics operation was extensive, with a total of five locations. In addition to Sun Lane in Zhabei, there was also No. 48 Sande Lane, Avenue Messager, No. 167 Peide Lane, Xinzha Road, No. 74 Chengxin Lane, Hebei Road, and No. 10 Gaozhao Lane, Xinzha Road. This clearly demonstrated their disregard for the law and the deep harm they caused. However, since the main culprits, Li Changrong and Wang Shunfa, had already escaped upon hearing the news, the arrested Zhang Wangshi, Xu Guihe, and Xu Jinfa, along with the 9,100 red pills and drug paraphernalia seized, were handed over by the police to the First Special District Court yesterday morning in accordance with Article 257 of the Criminal Code for transporting opium substitutes. Judge Liu Yugui presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the case and requested that Zhang and others be punished accordingly. To further substantiate the case, Gao Zhushi, a female offender who had already been convicted of selling red pills, was brought from the Western Jail to testify. Gao Zhushi had previously confessed that she had obtained the red pills from Li Changrong at No. 10 Gaozhao Lane, Xinzha Road. After Judge Liu questioned her in detail, he determined that the case was clear and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody after the conclusion of the debate, pending official sentencing next Thursday. The police are currently investigating the escaped main culprits, Li Changrong and Wang Shunfa.</p>

<p>Each side presents a grand debate, a war of words; the court orders sentencing next Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Lu Xingyuan, who once served as the President of the Provisional Court and the Seventh Court and is now a lawyer, and Shi Zhinan (also known as Shi Yuankai), who is currently an assistant at the Salt Inspectorate, were accused by Ouyang Shunying, the wife of the deceased Wang Yaochen (also known as Wang Youyu), a nominal French national from Xiamen, and represented by lawyer Qiu Hanping, of criminally prosecuting Du Ruizhen, Wang's concubine, for forging Wang Yaochen's will in Lu's office and forging Wang Yaochen's signature in the First Special District Court, requesting legal punishment. After the case was opened, Lu Xingyuan, in addition to jointly filing a counterclaim against Ouyang Shunying with Shi Zhinan, requesting that she be punished for false accusation, Lu also filed a separate criminal lawsuit against lawyer Qiu Hanping for false accusation, instigation of false accusation, and defamation. Judge Wu Zehan of the First Special District Court had summoned Lu for questioning, as reported previously. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu formally opened the court, summoned both plaintiffs and defendants, as well as witnesses, to the court for investigation. First, Qiu Hanping's defense and the attached counterclaim against Lu Xingyuan for false accusation were given to Lu to read in court. Lu then immediately stated the intent of prosecuting Qiu for three charges, stating that before September 3, Qiu reported to the Jing'an Temple Police that he, Shi Zhinan, and Du Ruizhen had colluded to forge Wang Yaochen's will and divide his estate, requesting a public prosecution. After the police sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate and found out that he had previously served as the president of this court and that Du Ruizhen had sold the property on Avenue Petain, they did not accept the case due to lack of evidence. Qiu then drafted a complaint on behalf of Ouyang Shunying and filed a private prosecution against them with the court. Although Qiu claimed to have reported to the police on behalf of Wang Ouyang, Wang did not go in person, and there were many arbitrary exaggerations and contradictions in the complaint. Therefore, Qiu's report to the police was a false accusation, and drafting an untrue complaint was instigation of false accusation. Leaking the contents of the complaint to newspapers constituted public insult and was intended to damage his reputation. Defendant Qiu Hanping stated that he reported to the police on September 2 on behalf of his client, Wang Ouyang, based on her instructions. In the month of this year, Wang and Du Ruizhen were involved in a lawsuit in Xiamen, and it was mentioned in the appeal that the will was forged. She then sent her nephew to Shanghai to entrust him to handle the matter and successively sent documents. Later, the police requested the original will as evidence, but the original was in Du Ruizhen's hands, so they did not file a public prosecution. Wang Ouyang then came to Shanghai in person to conduct a private assessment. The case has been opened several times, and the plaintiff has repeatedly appeared in court to state her case. If there was indeed a suspicion of instigating private prosecution, he would have been reported by the judge hearing the case without waiting for Lu Xingyuan to file a lawsuit. He had nothing to do with the newspaper publishing the matter. Although Lu pointed out that the manuscript was sent by him, there was no evidence. If he were to use such strong words and unreasonable arguments, he could also say that he did not know about the previous hearing of the case, but all the newspapers published it the next day, so he could say that Lu leaked it. As for the issue of Ouyang's nationality, she had mentioned it in court during the hearing of Shi Zhinan's lawsuit against her for debt on September 24. Lu Xingyuan was Shi's agent at the time and heard it in court, but now he suddenly said that her raising the issue of nationality was to avoid being subjected to false accusations and that it was instigated by him, completely ignoring the facts and arbitrarily making a judgment, and should dismiss the lawsuit and punish him for false accusation. Wang Ouyang also testified in court, stating that she did not know about the will until Du Ruizhen and others requested registration at the Xiamen French Consulate on March 17. In July, after learning that the property on Avenue Petain had been sold, she sent her nephew to Shanghai to investigate and immediately entrusted lawyer Qiu to handle the matter. First she reported to the police and then filed a private prosecution, all of which came from her intentions, and this claim had been decided in Xiamen. Although she had never studied, she could recognize her husband's handwriting, and the signature on the will was definitely not signed by her husband. The court then handed over the replies from various newspapers to Lu for review and informed him that the newspapers' reports were based on reports from their own reporters. Lu claimed that Qiu had given the complaint to the reporters in the audience to copy, but Qiu pointed out that it was speculation. The court then ordered the debate to begin. Lu first debated at length, first describing his past history, then talking about Qiu's various bad behaviors on behalf of Wang Ouyang, with many curses, and finally requesting that Qiu be sentenced to up to seven years of imprisonment for false accusation, saying that he must have his hair shaved and be made a prisoner, and should not be lenient. Qiu then rebutted, ignoring Lu's village woman's street cursing attitude, and refuting the accusations one by one, and also requesting that Lu be punished for false accusation. After the debate, the court adjourned and announced that the sentence would be announced at 2:00 PM on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Eight Important Cases Passed; Wu Zhijian Speaks After Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>A National News Agency reporter met yesterday with Mr. Wu Zhijian, Secretary-General of the China Leprosy Relief Association, who gave a detailed account of the Second National Leprosy Conference held in Guangzhou. According to him, the conference was held on November 8th and 9th, following the closing of the National Medical Conference. The first day was for experts to review proposals, and the second day was for speeches by guests and officials from various fields, including Director Wen Taihua representing Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang, Section Chief Wei Lesi representing Civil Affairs Director Lin Yizhong, Guangzhou Health Bureau Director Dr. Deng Zhende, Mr. Ma Le of the Macau Health Bureau, and Hong Kong Health Bureau Director Dr. Weilin Deng, as well as representatives from various provinces, totaling more than a hundred people. A total of eight resolutions were passed at the conference, including: (1) Requesting the Central Health Department to select physicians to study the latest leprosy medicines abroad for them to return to the country and implement; (2) Requesting the Central Health Department to forward to the provincial and municipal governments of each province to provide financial assistance to established leprosy hospitals or clinics, half of the original funding, in order to provide subsidies; (3) Requesting the provincial and municipal governments of each province to instruct their subordinate leprosy hospitals to establish more clinics, stipulate dates, and notify leprosy patients to come to the clinics for diagnosis and treatment in order to popularize the service; (4) Requesting the conference to ask the National Medical Association to organize a medical committee in order to arouse the medical community's attention to the leprosy issue; (5) Requesting the conference to submit to the Central Government to instruct the Health Department to establish a leprosy specialty in the near future in order to study and deal with all issues related to leprosy and achieve unified leadership; (6) Requesting the Central Government to promptly promulgate the leprosy decree, for leprosy patients to be protected and not discriminated against from other patients; (7) Requesting the Ministry of Education to stipulate any day of each year as "Leprosy Day" to promote national awareness; (8) Submitting to the Ministry of Education to instruct all schools to add leprosy courses so that people can have a deeper understanding. Overall, the conference went extremely well. Mr. Wu also said that the Guangzhou Municipal Government is currently preparing a relatively large-scale leprosy hospital, limited to be established by the end of this year. The Provincial Government has allocated 50,000 yuan to cooperate with the Municipal Government to establish an even larger leprosy hospital that can accommodate 1,000 patients. This plan can also be realized next year, which shows that the government is determined to eradicate the leprosy problem. Finally, the reporter asked when the new leprosy sanatorium built by the association in Dachang Town, Shanghai, would open. According to him, they are actively arranging the interior and rushing to print invitations. Once the arrangements are in place, the opening ceremony will be held around the end of this month, and patients will be admitted at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Rent Receipts Split into Two; Illegal Reduction of Housing Tax <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Kuang Baoying and others accused; the tenant's whereabouts unknown.</p>
<p>The Kuang Baoying and Kuang Menghuai brothers from Wuxi have many properties in Shanghai and have set up the Kuang Zhongji Rental Accounting Office to manage them. On March 1 last year, the rental housing company signed a lease agreement with Zhao Jinbao, renting the house at No. 21 Meiren Lane, Hankou Road, to open the Yourixin Xieji Bathhouse for a term of three years at a monthly rent of 300 yuan. Zhao wanted to reduce the one-quarter housing tax paid to the Public Works Department. Since paying the tax based on the rent amount would require 42 yuan per month, he negotiated with the landlord. The rental accounting office split the 300 yuan monthly rent receipt into two, each stating a rent of 150 yuan. Zhao concealed one of the receipts and used the other as the tax payment standard, only paying 21 yuan per month. The Public Works Department Tax Office initially did not know about the cheating and had no objections. Only this autumn, Zhao Jinbao was unable to operate due to owing too much rent and was sued by the landlord. He transferred the bathhouse to Wang Fangyuan and others, renaming it Xinji. According to the rent receipts transferred by Zhao, they paid the landlord a rent of 150 yuan per month. The rental accounting office rejected this, demanding a monthly rent of 200 yuan. Wang complained that the rent was too high and demanded a rent reduction. The landlord told them that the rent receipts had been changed in the past, only half the rent amount was filled in, invisibly reducing the housing tax expenditure, which was enough to offset the rent reduction, and refused to reduce the rent further. This led to a dispute between the landlord and the tenant. Later, this secret behavior of illegally reducing housing tax was revealed. The Tax Office reported to the Chief Inspector's Office, which sent detective Chen Yonggui to investigate and confirm the facts. The Public Works Department filed a lawsuit against Kuang Baoying and Kuang Menghuai for helping Zhao Jinshi illegally reduce housing tax, requesting punishment according to Articles 339 and 30 of the Prohibitory Law. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court issued summonses. Zhao Jinbao had already disappeared. Kuang Baoying also failed to appear, so only Kuang Menghuai surrendered. The Public Works Department lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the process of the defendant helping the tenant illegally reduce the tax and presented the rent receipts issued by the Kuang Zhongji Rental Accounting Office and the judgment of the defendant suing Zhao Jinbao for rent arrears, proving that the rent of the house now leased by Wang Fangyuan was indeed 300 yuan per month. Judge Dai questioned the defendant Kuang Menghuai and ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>

<p>Qu Zhibu Hospital Performs Laparotomy</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Shi Zhizhi, a Ningbo native residing at the customs declaration office at No. 10 Penglai Road, Nanshi, works at the joint venture of the "Made in China Paper Plate" company on the Public Concession race course. In October of the sixth year of the Republic of China, he was introduced to marry Zhou Rongli (also known as Zhou), a woman from his hometown, who is now 36 years old. They have not had any children. It is learned that Mrs. Shi Zhou's abdomen gradually swelled in the eighth year of the Republic of China, but her diet, daily life, and monthly menstruation were normal. During the "January 28th Incident" in Shanghai, she requested treatment from the Qu Zhibu Hospital on Penglai Road. After examination by Dr. Ye Xincheng of the hospital, it was determined that surgery was necessary to cut open the abdomen and remove the growth. At that time, the situation was unstable, so the surgery was abandoned. It has been fifteen years since the onset of the disease, and now her abdomen is even larger, making daily life difficult. On the 14th of this month, she returned to Qu Zhibu Hospital for treatment. Hospital Director Qu Zhibu personally performed the laparotomy and completely removed the growth from the woman's abdomen. She is expected to be discharged from the hospital in about ten days. According to what the hospital director told the National News Agency reporter yesterday, the condition is called an ovarian cyst. The yellow-red greasy liquid weighed 87 pounds and was placed in a medicine tank for display and reference. Qu also said that although this condition has been found at the Hong Kong Road Red Cross Hospital and the Baker Road Chiang Hospital, the growths were only about 30 pounds. He has never seen one this large, which is truly rare.</p>

<p>Water Disaster Relief Association Telegrams Her Husband to Shanghai to Take Her Back; The Husband Arrives and She Commits Suicide in the Hospital</p>
<p>Yu Songshi, the 28-year-old wife of Yu Dingyuan from Wangdian, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, was suddenly abducted to Shanghai by a man named Zhang Mingshan (according to the woman) while visiting her mother's home. She was lodged in a local inn. Fearing that Zhang intended to sell her, she escaped a few days ago and sought help from the Yunann Road Renji Tang Water Disaster Relief Association. The association, after learning the facts, sent a telegram to her husband, Yu Dingyuan, to come to Shanghai to reunite with her, and sent the woman to the Haidongchun Hotel on Baixianqiao Road for temporary accommodation. However, the woman was so traumatized by the abduction that she committed suicide by hanging herself with a belt in the hotel that night. Fortunately, she was discovered and rescued by the tea attendant, and her life was saved. The hotel then reported the incident to the association by telephone. The association, upon receiving the report, took the woman back and sent her to the Aiwenniyi Road Mental Hospital with a letter and staff. Since the woman had attempted suicide, the hospital was instructed to pay special attention to her. Her husband, after receiving the telegram from the Water Disaster Relief Association, learned of his wife's whereabouts and came to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. He went to the association to take his wife back for a reunion. However, when her husband arrived at the association, the hospital suddenly telephoned, saying that the woman had committed suicide in the hospital. After receiving the call, the association instructed her husband to go to the hospital to arrange for the retrieval and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Lawsuit over Wet Nurse's Lack of Milk <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Failure to Return Wages After Leaving Without Permission; Employer Sues for Fraud and Breach of Trust</p>
<p>Zhu Jianren, a 34-year-old Cantonese woman residing at No. 517 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, is currently full-term pregnant. She was admitted to the Renhe Hospital at No. 36 Rue Moliere for delivery. On the 22nd of last month, she gave birth to a healthy baby girl, much to the family's delight. She entrusted Guo Tiaomei, a relative who is a lawyer, to hire a wet nurse from various matchmaking agencies to feed the baby. Guo Tiaomei first gathered more than ten wet nurses and had their milk, blood, and physique tested at the Renhe Hospital. The test results showed that only the young woman from Yangzhou, Wu, brought by the Jin matchmaking agency at No. 202 Avenue Joffre, was qualified in terms of milk, blood, and body. The rest were dismissed, and Wu was hired. After a three-day trial, the three parties, the employer, the wet nurse, and the matchmaking agency, agreed on a monthly salary of 7 yuan. The matchmaking agency issued a guarantee, and Wu was formally hired. However, Wu's milk suddenly stopped after feeding the baby for a week, and a dispute arose. Wu then left. Zhu Jianren, whose baby is not yet a month old, expressed dissatisfaction with the wet nurse Wu and the Jin matchmaking agency and entrusted lawyer Guo Tiaomei to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Special Court, accusing the Jin matchmaking agency and Wu of fraud and breach of trust, requesting an investigation and, as an ancillary civil lawsuit, seeking compensation for the paid wages, matchmaking fee, and hospital examination fee. Upon receiving the complaint, Judge Wang Wangxu of the Criminal Court summoned Zhou Nanshan (30 years old, from Suzhou), the owner of the Jin matchmaking agency, and Wu to the court yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated the intent of the prosecution, saying that after the plaintiff gave birth, she hired a wet nurse from more than ten candidates. She heard that Wu's milk was thick and qualified, and the matchmaking agency identified her on the spot and hired her at a monthly salary of 7 yuan. At that time, Wu claimed that her family was poor and requested to be paid several months' wages in advance to settle her family so that she could feed the baby with peace of mind. She asked to be paid five months' wages, and the plaintiff agreed to pay 35 yuan. However, after being hired for three or four days, Wu's milk suddenly stopped. When asked, Wu also requested to have eel, meat, dishes, and tonics to stimulate milk production. The employer agreed to provide them. However, the milk still did not increase much. The hospital's head nurse, Miss Liu, and others discovered that Wu was secretly throwing away the milk in the middle of the night. They negotiated with the matchmaking agency, but they shirked responsibility. They demanded that Wu return the wages and hire another wet nurse, but Wu refused to return the wages. They asked her to work as a nanny to offset the wages paid, but Wu also refused. Later, the matchmaking agency took Wu away. This shows that the defendants intended to commit fraud and breach of trust and should be punished according to the law. They requested that the ancillary civil lawsuit be approved and that the paid wages of five months, totaling 35 yuan, the doctor's examination fee of 6 yuan and 2 jiao, and the matchmaking fee of 5 yuan and 6 jiao, totaling 46 yuan and 8 jiao, be borne by the two defendants. They also presented the guarantee issued by the matchmaking agency as evidence. Zhou Nanshan, the owner of the Jin matchmaking agency, confessed that he had guaranteed the wet nurse. He only collected two months' wages at the time, which is the regulation set by various matchmaking agencies in Shanghai. He did not collect five months' wages. He said that Guo, the lawyer, came to hire the wet nurse, and his employee, surnamed Ge, sent Wu there. Later, due to the lack of milk, lawyer Guo came to negotiate with him. He replied that the matchmaking agency only guarantees against the wet nurse's escape or unexpected events. Lack of milk is not something he could say. He also told the employer that they wanted Wu to return the money, but Wu could not afford to return it. Lawyer Guo insisted on returning the money and pushed him and Wu out the door and closed the door. At that time, he thought the matter was over and Wu had returned to Yangzhou. Later, he received a summons and called Wu to Shanghai. Wu confessed that she only received one month's wages, which she used to pay the matchmaking fee and send her child home. The reason for the lack of milk was that it was not enough for the child to eat. She did not throw away the milk. The official showed Wu's guarantee, which stated that she had received five months' wages, 35 yuan, to Zhou Nanshan. After reading it, Zhou said that the numbers "five months, 35 yuan" were not written by his employee, surnamed Ge. He called his employee Ge Acheng, who was in the audience, to look at it. Ge also said that these numbers were not written by him, but the rest was written by him, and that the handwriting could be compared. The plaintiff's lawyer said that the guarantee was written by the defendant himself. The court then ordered the debate to begin and announced that the sentence would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 22nd.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-based state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Jiangtian steamer, sailing the Ningbo route, set sail from Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 16th. Shortly after leaving the third beacon, a middle-aged male passenger in a Western suit, looking utterly exhausted, was attended to by the steward Chen Zhiwen and given a berth to rest. During their conversation, it was learned that the passenger had not yet purchased a ticket and was waiting for a friend to do so. He was seen heading toward the first-class cabins and did not return for quite some time, which raised suspicion. A search was conducted, but he was nowhere to be found. Upon inspecting his berth, a gray fedora, a wine bottle, and a note were discovered. The note was filled with complaints and world-weary words, suggesting that he had jumped into the sea to commit suicide. The purser was immediately informed. The steamer returned to Shanghai yesterday and the belongings were handed over to the company to be claimed.</p>

<h3 id="e147">The Path to Political Reform (Continued) <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>(November 1935, Shanghai)</p>
<p>—Respectfully dedicated to the comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang and gentlemen who are interested in discussing political reform—</p>
<p>(3) Given the vast territory and large population of the country, it is impossible for all members of the Kuomintang to directly exercise "political power." The National Assembly as stipulated in the Constitution remains a representative and deliberative body for exercising "political power." To enable the Kuomintang to lead the people in exercising "political power" during the transitional period, the election of National Assembly representatives can draw on the established practices of Russia, Italy, and Germany.  Referring also to the election methods of previous Kuomintang National Congresses, the following two methods should be adopted in the representative election law after determining the number of representatives based on the population proportion of each county, city, and district: (a) The Kuomintang nominates twice the number of candidates in each city, county, and district, not limited to party members, and allows voters to elect them; (b) Voters in each city, county, and district elect twice the number of candidates, naturally also not limited to party members, and submits them to the Kuomintang for decision.</p>
<p>(4) Since the National Assembly is still a deliberative body, the Constitution should stipulate a clause stating, "The National Assembly represents all the people in collectively managing political power, organized by the following National Representatives." The powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum it holds should also be appropriately defined. I believe that to clearly delineate "political power" and "governing power" and to centralize the responsibility for exercising governing power, the National Assembly's electoral and recall powers should only apply to the President and Vice President. As for the heads of the five Yuan (branches of government), the President can nominate candidates and appoint them after obtaining the consent of the National Assembly, holding them responsible to the National Assembly. Furthermore, the National Assembly's power to impeach the President should be limited to cases of illegal conduct. Regarding policy issues, the National Assembly can only pass resolutions requesting the President to dismiss the Premier of the Executive Yuan to express its disapproval. Of course, the President also has the power to dismiss the heads of the five Yuan. Speaking of the power of initiative, the National Assembly should have the power to directly enact complete legislation, but the President should also have the power to return it for reconsideration. As for the power of referendum, in addition to the National Assembly itself having the power to hold a referendum on legislation passed by the Legislative Yuan, the President or the Legislative Yuan should also be able to submit legislation passed, rejected, or unable to be established by the Legislative Yuan to the National Assembly for a referendum.</p>
<p>(5) The term of office for National Representatives should be four years. The National Assembly should convene once a year, with a session limited to one month, which may be extended by one month if necessary. If the President deems it necessary, or if one-third or more of the National Representatives deem it necessary, a special session of the National Assembly may be convened. In this way, during the recess of the National Assembly, it is not necessary to establish a "standing committee" to act as its representative. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e148">An Overview of the Wool and Yarn Industry in Shanghai <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview, Part 2)</p>
<p>I. The Two Major Stages of the Wool and Yarn Industry in Shanghai</p>
<p>The raw materials for clothing in China have traditionally been limited to three types of textiles: cotton, silk, and hemp. However, since the late Qing Dynasty, urban and rural residents have not only utilized newly imported wool and woolen fabrics but have also learned to enjoy using wool yarn to knit clothing, socks, gloves, and the like. The content of people's lives has certainly become richer, but the power of foreign merchants has also grown as a result.</p>
<p>Wool yarn is commonly referred to as "mao leng" (毛冷). It is primarily made from spun wool and is a good raw material for winter clothing. Initially, the Chinese did not know how to imitate it, and it was entirely imported from overseas. During the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, those in Shanghai who sold these imported goods were mostly general stores that also sold cotton or hemp ropes. Their scale was small and they could not form an industry. Later, woolen knitwear gradually became popular inland, and sales grew daily, yielding substantial profits. Specialized wool yarn shops in Shanghai flourished, and today, Xingsheng Street in the French Concession has long become "Wool Yarn Street," the main base for the industry. There are nearly ten businesses of the same type there, and twenty businesses have joined the trade association, most of which combine retail and wholesale. Among them, Jin Yuanmao and Longxingchang have a longer history and more developed businesses. Although department stores also sell wool yarn, they are not as concentrated and extensive as the shops on Xingsheng Street.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, wool yarn is an imported product. The largest importer is the United Kingdom. The Bee brand wool yarn produced by Patons &amp; Baldwins in the UK is particularly well-known and widely used by the Chinese. Here is a table listing the import amounts for the most recent three years and the first three quarters of this year for reference:</p>
<p>|                      | 1932         | 1933         | 1934         | First Three Quarters of 1935 |</p>
<p>| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- |</p>
<p>| United Kingdom       | 5,165,773    | 4,42,497     | 4,4180,421   | Not Available                 |</p>
<p>| Other Countries      | 2,435,53    | 21,206,853   | 2,302,602    | Not Available                 |</p>
<p>| Total                | 7,601,295    | 6,618,350    | 6,483,023    | 1,105,985                     |</p>
<p>Note: Figures are based on customs trade reports, in customs gold units.</p>
<p>The import of wool yarn in the first three quarters of 1935 is significantly lower than in the same period last year, likely because Patons &amp; Baldwins has established a branch factory in Shanghai. Therefore, in essence, the UK remains the leading importer of wool yarn.</p>
<p>Shanghai is an important hub for industry and commerce nationwide, and the wool yarn trade is no exception. Therefore, in terms of customs districts, Shanghai accounts for a large proportion of wool yarn imports. See the table below:</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Wool Yarn Imports by Customs District for the Last Three Years</p>
<p>|                  | 1932        | 1933        | 1934        |</p>
<p>| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |</p>
<p>| Shanghai         | 5,256,367   | 5,169,556   | 5,341,599   |</p>
<p>| Other Customs Districts | 2,344,928   | 1,448,794   | 1,096,424   |</p>
<p>| Total            | 7,601,295   | 6,618,350   | 6,438,023   |</p>
<p>Note: Same as above.</p>
<p>The period for ordering wool yarn in Shanghai is generally around the Lunar New Year. At that time, the sales for the year are completely determined, and businesses can use this information to gauge sales for the coming year and set their order targets. Most businesses entrust their orders to foreign firms, such as Dete, Baohua, Xiangchen, and Lihe, all of which engage in the trade. In the past, most of the Bee brand wool yarn was ordered through the EWO, Jardine, and Zhonghe firms before manufacturing. The goods generally arrive in May or June of the following year. Sales to other regions end after September. Wool yarn sales from Shanghai can be divided into three regions: the Pearl River, the Yangtze River, and North China. Before the September 18th Incident, Northeast China was also a large market. This is a general overview of the wool yarn trade in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The wool yarn industry in Shanghai can be divided into two major stages: purely trading and manufacturing combined with trading. The former has already been described, and we will now proceed to discuss how it entered the manufacturing stage.</p>
<p>Wool yarn is essentially a light industrial product, and imitation is not difficult. The only real obstacle is the raw material. In recent years, Chinese people have recognized the substantial achievements in the development of wool in the Northwest region. Furthermore, because wool yarn has long been imported from overseas, resulting in significant losses, they have started setting up factories to manufacture it themselves in an attempt to recover the lost profits. There are two companies in Tianjin, Dongya and Xianghe, and five in Shanghai, including Zhenxing Zhanghua (which has now stopped spinning wool yarn) and Shanghai Yumin China. They show promising signs of continued growth. The concern is that Patons &amp; Baldwins of the UK, due to increased tariffs on wool yarn in China, established a factory in Shanghai last year to avoid customs barriers. With its strong capital and advanced technology, it poses a significant threat to the nascent wool yarn industry in China. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e151">Financial Committee of the China Education Foundation Decides to Allocate Funds for Compulsory Education in Detail <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>An amount of 37,500 yuan will be allocated every two months.</p>
<p>Sun Hongfen said that paying in installments would not be a major difficulty.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Board of Directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation, funded by the American Boxer Indemnity, previously resolved to subsidize compulsory education expenses nationwide with 300,000 yuan, to be allocated over two years at 150,000 yuan per year, in response to a request from the Ministry of Education regarding funding for compulsory education nationwide. However, the Foundation is experiencing financial difficulties and can only raise 70,000 yuan at present. The remaining amount will be discussed by the Finance Committee to determine fundraising methods. Xu Xinliu, Baker, and Hu Shi, members of the Finance Committee and Executive Committee stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, returned to Beijing immediately to convene a meeting. Due to business commitments, committee members Xu Xinliu and Baker were unable to come to Beijing. Executive Committee member Hu Shi arrived in Beiping this morning. The China Education Foundation convened a meeting of the Finance Committee at its meeting hall at 4:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Meeting Details</p>
<p>At the time, Director-General Sun Hongfen, former Director-General Ren Hongjun, accountants Zhou Yichun and Jin Shuchu, and Executive Committee representative Hu Shi, totaling five people, were present. Director-General Sun Hongfen chaired the meeting. The chairman first reported on the purpose of convening the meeting, stating that the Foundation's previous general meeting resolved to subsidize compulsory education expenses nationwide with 300,000 yuan. However, the Foundation is facing economic difficulties, and the issue of how to allocate these funds and how to raise the shortfall urgently needs to be resolved. Therefore, the Finance Committee was convened today to ask everyone to express their opinions. The discussion then began.</p>
<p>Funding Allocation Method</p>
<p>Regarding the method of allocating the 300,000 yuan subsidy for compulsory education expenses nationwide, after an exchange of opinions among the committee members, the following was decided: The subsidy of 300,000 yuan, as resolved by the previous general meeting, was to be allocated over two years. Now, due to economic difficulties, it was decided to adopt a method of allocating funds in installments, allocating the 300,000 yuan subsidy in eight installments, allocating 37,500 yuan every two months. A detailed consultation was also held on the Foundation's routine financial issues. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Sun Hongfen's Remarks</p>
<p>According to an interview with Director-General Sun Hongfen by a reporter: (1) The Foundation has decided to allocate the 300,000 yuan subsidy for compulsory education expenses nationwide in eight installments, allocating four times per year. This is a method devised to address the Foundation's financial difficulties. I anticipate that allocating the funds in this way, due to the small amount, may not cause major difficulties. The first batch of funds to be allocated may be disbursed by the end of this month or early next month. In short, since the Foundation has agreed to the Ministry of Education's subsidy for compulsory education expenses with 300,000 yuan, the Foundation will find a way to disburse the funds on schedule, no matter how difficult the finances are. (2) The Foundation advocates for specialized academic research and has established a "Cooperative Research Special Fund Committee" with Peking University. The Foundation and Peking University each contribute a portion of the funds annually, deposited in a bank. When either party needs funds, they can overdraw from this deposit. President Jiang (Menglin) serves as the chairman of the Cooperative Research Committee. This is the fifth year of the fund. This year, the China Education Foundation deposited 200,000 yuan and Peking University deposited 100,000 yuan. It is said that Peking University is currently distributing 7,500 yuan in student aid from the previous year to the various colleges, which will be overdrawn from this deposit, and the Foundation has been notified.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Marine Animal Collection Group of the Peiping Research Institute Discovers Cephalodiscus in Qingdao <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>This worm is intermediate between higher and lower animals.</p>
<p>Over 1,000 jars of marine animals were collected this time.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) The Zoology Institute of the National Peiping Research Institute, in cooperation with the Qingdao Municipal Government, formed the "Jiaozhou Bay Marine Animal Collection Group" this spring. They went to Qingdao on May 1 for the first collection and again on September 27 for the second collection. The work has been completed, and the collected items have been transported to Beiping. The staff has also returned to Beiping. According to an interview with Zhang Xi, the head of the group, as follows:</p>
<p>Collection Scope</p>
<p>This trip to Jiaozhou Bay for collection was the second phase of work since the establishment of our group. The participants included Gu Guangzhong, Xiang Juli, Liu Yongbin, Kang Letian, and myself, all from the Zoology Institute of the Peiping Research Institute. We went to Qingdao on September 27 and completed the work on November 2, totaling 37 days. Excluding travel time, the actual work was only one month. The collection area was still within Jiaozhou Bay and the nearby coast. Because the Shandong Peninsula is quite important for Chinese marine animals, we used Qingdao as a research center for work convenience.</p>
<p>New Discoveries</p>
<p>We collected approximately 1,000 jars of marine animals this time. The harvest was different from the first collection because the last time was in spring and this time was in autumn. Marine animals often vary due to different seasons, so what we obtained in spring and autumn cannot be completely the same. The biggest gain this time was finding three species of Cephalodiscus and different species of Cephalodiscus. This Cephalodiscus occupies an important position in the biological world because it is intermediate between higher and lower animals. However, because this type of animal is mostly hidden in the seabed sand and rocks, it is very difficult to collect. We were very pleased to have obtained so many as three species this time. As for other new discoveries, they will have to wait until we open the boxes and study them one by one before we can determine them.</p>
<p>Collection Next Year</p>
<p>Because our group has a cooperative relationship with the Qingdao Municipal Government, we will still go to collect next year. This year's work will end here. Next year, we will collect at most three times, and at least two times. Whether we will extend the work after collecting next year is difficult to predict at this moment because the Qingdao Municipal Government stipulates that the collection work be completed within two years.

<p>Issuing a First-Step Work Schedule for Compliance</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education yesterday issued instructions to the education bureaus of 60 counties, including Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Songjiang, and Baoshan, stating: "In order to promote health education, the Provincial Health Education Committee was specifically organized, and a work outline was formulated. The second meeting decided that the bureaus should be notified to handle the matter. Currently, it has been found that some counties have organized committees to handle health education matters, while others are directly handled by the bureaus. Some have organized health education committees or health education guidance committees. The responsibilities are not defined, and the names are also very diverse, which is an obstacle to the future of promotion. Based on the recommendation of the Jiangsu Provincial Health Education Committee, please order all counties to organize county health education committees immediately, with the health education instructors of each bureau as the center, and under the leadership of the educational authorities, to be responsible for handling all county health education promotion matters. All health education committees or health education guidance committees that have been organized but have different names should be uniformly corrected to be consistent. In addition, a seven-item table of first-step work has been drafted, and the recommendation of each council has been reviewed, all of which are essential and feasible. Compliance should be ordered. In addition to separate orders, urgently issue a seven-item table of first-step work, ordering the bureau chiefs to supervise the health education instructors and seriously handle the matter. The organization of the health education committees in each county should refer to the organization of the Provincial Health Education Committee, and the compliance should be reported at any time for inspection and review. The attached list of first-step work items for health education in each county is as follows: (1) Hold health lectures, (2) Show health education films, (3) Guide children's hygiene habits, (4) Examine children's physical condition, (5) Vaccinations, (6) First aid knowledge drills, (7) Hold health education talks for parents."</p>

<p>After consultation with the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Safety</p>
<p>And ordering all bookstores in the city to comply</p>
<p>The serial comic books published by various bookstores in this city are mostly works of gods, monsters, obscenity, etc. Since the Bureau of Education began rectification the year before last, various new pictures have been improved day by day, and gradual results have been achieved. However, since the Book and Magazine Review Committee of the Central Propaganda Committee stopped working, no one has been responsible for reviewing the drafts, causing the attitude of the bookstores to revive, competing to print pictures of gods, monsters and obscenities, almost abandoning all previous efforts, which is a pity. Therefore, after consultation between the Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Safety, it was decided that before the central review agency is reorganized and established, the Bureau of Education will still be responsible for presiding over the review work, and the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Safety will assist in handling it. This method has been reported to the municipal government and has been ordered to all bookstores to comply, it is said.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Department of Social Education of Great China University in 1920, the content of the curriculum has been enriched and systematized through the planning of the former director, Ma Zongrong. This year, a course on film education has been added. Recently, because the central government has paid great attention to broadcast education, in order to increase students' knowledge of mechanical aspects, Hu Ruding, director of the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant of the Construction Committee and director of the Department of Electrical Engineering of Zhejiang University, was specially invited to give a lecture on the mechanical installation of broadcast education at 5 pm this Monday. Two or three hundred students from the College of Education and the College of Science attended the lecture. Mr. Hu first described the 40-year brief history of radio development and its trend in our country, and pointed out its proper use. At present, there are more than 100 radio stations of all sizes in the country, with the Central Broadcasting Station being the largest with 75 kilowatts, ranking second in the world. Next, he described the structure and functions of the large-scale domestic radio receiver he brought from the factory. The evaluation of the radio receiver is based on the two most important conditions of selectivity and publicity or credibility. The trend of its structure does not necessarily determine the quality by the number of vacuum tubes and bulbs, but rather the improvement of other parts. He also distributed the instruction manual for the Jiandian No. 58 radio, which is specially designed for use in empty and remote places without power supply, and has the four major characteristics of long reception distance, power saving, accurate sound, and easy repair. Finally, the students asked questions and Mr. Hu answered them one by one, and everyone dispersed happily at 6 o'clock.</p>

He first described the development of mobile maps in China, and then described the history of automobile invention and its cooperation with books and the various benefits. The listeners were all very interested, it is said.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"I don't mind; but if I feel a little inconvenient, I would like to give you those drawers, because I value the treasures of children, and I think they should be respected and cherished. Don, I am now willing to make a deal with you. I hope you can keep your credit. Here are twelve drawers, one for each month, just enough for a year. If you can fulfill some of your little responsibilities, then you can earn a few, and those few will be yours. I believe that certain types of rewards are especially for young people; they can help us move forward. We initially try to be good for the sake of rewards, but if used properly, we will soon be happy to be good regardless of other things."</p>
<p>"Do you also have rewards?" Don asked, looking as if he had never heard the above words.</p>
<p>"Of course, I can't do without them. But my rewards are not drawers, or gifts, or more days off, but also what I love very much, just as you love those things. The good character and success of my students are one of my beloved rewards. I try to get it, just as I want you to work hard to get that cabinet. Forcing yourself to do what you don't like to do, and doing it well, then you can get two rewards—first, the prize that you can see and touch; the other is the joy of fulfilling a responsibility happily. Do you understand this?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>The gold market was initially strong but then weakened yesterday.

It was predicted that the price of silver in India would also remain stable, and no significant changes were expected thereafter. The afternoon market remained stable, with continued selling interest from banks, making it difficult for the market to rally.

<h3 id="e183">The Money Shops' Allocation of Head Quotas is Ineffective <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Recently, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank have issued head quotas in legal tender daily. Previously, these quotas were allocated to the money shops by these three banks. However, since legal tender issued downward can be used for payment without needing to be allocated from the money shops, the market has ample quotas, and there is no need to add water. The money shops, on the other hand, are suffering from the inability to allocate quotas. Even intra-industry allocations are proving difficult. The interbank call loan rate remains at one cent and three mils, unchanged from morning to afternoon. In the morning, over 3.2 million was transacted for account transfers, with over 400,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon, transactions amounted to 300,000. Transactions at the Smaller Banks Association totaled 600,000. Over 500,000 was used for the redemption of foreign pledges, with over 700,000 in new issuances. Banknotes issued totaled over 1.4 million locally and over 700,000 to other locations. Bank receipts and payments: Foreign banks received over 2.9 million in drafts, over 4.7 million in various goods and foreign exchange, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 600,000 in special transfers, and over 300,000 in settlement differences. Chinese banks received over 3.2 million in drafts, over 3.8 million in various goods and foreign exchange, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 400,000 in special transfers, and over 400,000 in settlement differences. Japanese banks received over 3.1 million in drafts, over 2.7 million in various goods and foreign exchange, over 300,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 500,000 in special transfers, and over 300,000 in settlement differences. Money shops received over 5.1 million in foreign public notes, over 420,000 in foreign head quota allocations, and over 600,000 in various remittance quotas. Subsidiary currency market: Small foreign silver coins are being bought up by certain parties daily, and smaller industry players are unwilling to sell, causing the black market price to steadily rise. Yesterday, it reached eleven cents and two and a half mils, but transactions remain scarce. In the Jiangjiao early market, 3,000 jiao were transacted. In the Guangdong early market, 30,000 jiao were transacted. The market was inactive. Copper coins remained at 3,000. A total of 20,400 strings were transacted, equivalent to 6,800 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Also, the total value of notes cleared at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 19th was 14,298,403.72 yuan in national currency, including 10,670,476.20 yuan in total clearings, 2,096,402.04 yuan in total collections for the money shops, and 1,531,525.48 yuan for others. Furthermore, the interest rate for interbank call loans backed by public notes from the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee was 1.5 mils per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate for public notes was 2 mils per thousand yuan per day.</p>

<p>Forward Government Bonds Series 6 Hits Limit Up Again</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities and Easy Exchange, the market suddenly experienced an extraordinary surge. Although buying from No. 46 was suspended, No. 54 suddenly had a large appetite, seemingly even more enthusiastic than No. 46. Market sentiment was boosted, and bullish speculators were very active. Retail shorts were particularly active in covering positions. The strength of the upward trend was such that it advanced unabated amidst all obstacles. The evening news made the situation even more serious. The reason for the rise was solely due to bullish speculators driving up prices. Those without goods to cover were almost extinct. The future is increasingly worrying. Yesterday's events: The market opened with a strong upward trend. Troop Reduction bonds rose by one yuan. Government Bonds Series 6 surged by over two yuan. Numbers 22, 43, 54, 78, etc., as well as retail investors, were buying actively. Among them, No. 54 had the strongest appetite. In the second session, the various groups were active in covering short positions. Troop Reduction bonds even surged by another 2.3 yuan, with the highest price being close to the limit-up price. Number 48 was the most aggressive in raising prices. Numbers 54 and 78, etc., continued to buy, but the upward trend was relatively weaker after entering. Government Bonds Series 6, nearing expiration, only rose by one yuan. The closing was delayed until 5:30 PM. The initial auction was stable, but then prices were driven up again, gradually trending higher. Forward Government Bonds Series 6 rose by over four yuan in one day, hitting the limit up. However, the black market already had a small number of mils. It was clear that speculators were creating a bullish situation. Therefore, they did not hesitate to sacrifice the last forward Government Bonds Series 6 to raise the limit-up price. As a result, market prices surged by over one yuan to as much as four yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 40 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>According to the report from Sin Fung &amp; Co., yesterday (18th), bullish sentiment emerged strongly in the New York stock market.

<p>--Long-Term Yarn Exceeds 200 Yuan Customs Clearance--</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firmer, and the upward momentum is becoming more intense. As news from the North improves, public sentiment is stabilized, buyers are active, and shorts are covering positions. Both sides are advancing simultaneously, and prices are rising directly. However, spot yarn sales remain quiet. In fact, cotton prices are firm and high, increasing costs. Given favorable conditions, buying interest is particularly strong. All months are up between 3.20 and 4.60 yuan. Long-term contracts have again exceeded the 200 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Jumps More Than Four Yuan</p>
<p>The opening of the branded yarn market in the morning showed a stable trend for all months. As overseas cotton conditions trended downstream and there were rumors that factories would deliver this month, market conditions deteriorated further. The opening prices for all months fell by 40-50 cents. The market remained calm until the second session. By the third closing, prices suddenly increased, and there were more buyers. All months jumped by more than one yuan. As a result, all months rose by 20 cents to 1.20 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market tightened suddenly at the afternoon opening. Trading was unusually brisk, and buying interest was extremely strong. All months jumped by 2-3 yuan. It was reported that the situation in North China had improved, and Western newspapers had recorded four facts. As a result, public sentiment was shaken, and buyers were eager. The market was tightening further with each session. All months rose by 3-3.6 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuan Da sold 1,100 bales, Sen Kang 550 bales, Yi Chang 1,950 bales, Da Fu 1,500 bales, Da Feng 1,050 bales, Rui Da 1,850 bales, Da Chang Cheng 950 bales, and Chang Feng 1,300 bales.

<p>Yarn and Thread Both Up Three to Four Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still sluggish. It was found that all groups bought a total of 478 bales for the day. Market prices for yarn rose by 2 yuan and thread by 4 yuan. The buying volume for each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Mainland 200 Ningbo 15 Peers 80</p>
<p>Nanjing 13 Shantou 30 Jiangxi 30</p>
<p>Xuzhou 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm, and the situation is very tight. As news of peace in the current situation spreads and rumors subside, the yarn market is rising and the cotton market is soaring. Bullish speculators were originally very bullish. With this good news as assistance, they are driving prices even higher. The long-term contracts have exceeded the peak since the Ministry of Finance revised the legal tender on November 4. Long-term contracts exceeded the 3 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rises Sharply in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of the branded cotton market in the morning, prices for all months were uniformly down. As the American and Indian cotton markets fell together, the market situation was flat. Unexpectedly, major players came to buy again at the third closing, and prices suddenly rose. Long-term contracts exceeded the 3 yuan mark, reaching a new high since November 4. As a result, near-term contracts remained unchanged, and long-term contracts rose by 30-40 cents. The market suddenly jumped sharply at the afternoon opening, with tremendous momentum. As the yarn market rose sharply, the cotton market entered a high state. However, Chang He sold 10,000 dan on behalf of a foreign firm, causing the market to loosen. The third closing prices fell back. As a result, all months rose by 10-50 cents compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Shen Ji sold 3,800 dan, Yuan Yi 3,600 dan, Heng Yi 1,200 dan, Run Kang 1,800 dan, Yi Kang 1,700 dan, Da Feng 1,500 dan, Chang Ji 1,500 dan, Chang Feng 6,700 dan, Xin Cheng 4,700 dan, and Chang He 13,300 dan.

<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange and the Branded Yarn and Cotton Market, in view of the wild fluctuations the other day, the Exchange, in order to maintain stability, increased the special margin for branded cotton yarn to avoid danger. Currently, due to the local authorities in Shanghai clearing up the rumors and people's minds settling down, the various markets are gradually returning to their previous state, and the market has gradually calmed down. From today (i.e., the 20th), the increase in the special margin is completely cancelled, and the previously increased funds will be returned.</p>

<p>Cotton Inventory at 15.244 Million Bales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with unstable conditions. Prices fell due to poor news from Liverpool, Egypt, and India, bullish speculators closing out positions, cotton farmers hedging sales, and improving weather. All months fell by 6-10 points. At the same time, there were rumors that cotton hoarders were selling, but this was not confirmed. Bullish speculators in December contracts slightly closed out and shifted to long-term contracts. Later, industry players bought and those shorting contracts covered their positions, leading to a slight reaction. Unfortunately, after a brief rebound, bullish speculators closed out positions again. The spot basis remains firm. According to a survey by the Cotton Exchange, as of the end of October, the total cotton inventory in the United States, including unpicked cotton and government-owned cotton, totaled 15,244,000 bales, compared to 14,633,000 bales in the same period last year. The market closed stable, with spot prices down 10 points and futures prices down 5-12 points. English cotton spot prices fell 4 points, and futures prices fell 4-5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to Japanese merchants buying, but later weakened due to bullish speculators closing out positions and futures traders selling. Pingguoer fell by 1.75-2 rupees, Aomla fell by 2.25-2.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 3 rupees. The original telegram records are below (dated the 18th):</p>

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, at the opening in the morning, prices for all months showed a trend of steadily rising. The quoted prices for foreign wheat, Chicago, had a small difference of 0.20 yuan, and Canada had a difference of 0.10 yuan. Market sentiment, due to reports of easing in the situation in North China, and the rumored increase in customs duties to 2.50 yuan soon, caused dormant sentiment to revive buying interest inside and outside the industry and regain momentum. All long-term months were shouting to rise by more than 0.20 yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was even more noble, because the situation in North China had been resolved. As a result, the recent flour with actual sales was quite brisk, and long-term buyers were even more active, and the rise was even sharper. After this, if the environment does not change, the time for foreign wheat has not come, and people's hearts will eventually be easily excited.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat market, prices in the morning were flat due to a slight increase in the quoted price of foreign wheat. Suddenly, the flour market rose sharply, and the northern situation was reportedly resolved. People inside and outside the industry, after extreme panic, naturally received comfort. Therefore, buyers were prosperous, and prices rose 5-6 points. At the opening in the afternoon, although there were few transactions this month, the prices held firm. Due to the small number of chips, buyers intended to take delivery. The distant futures were also firm because the compromise had been reached. Going forward, half of the situation will depend on leading up to 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Shandong wheat opened at 4.95 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 4.94 yuan, Hankou wheat at 4.77 yuan, and Danyang wheat at 4.92 yuan. From Xinda, 1,000 bags were handled.</p>

<p>—Ke Xian Rice Also Stagnant—</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were still more than 60 sources (totaling more than 12,000 shih) from each group. Retail sales remained sluggish, and the market was difficult to boost. If the price of Xin Jing rice such as Li Zao falls by 0.20-0.30 yuan, although Du Yang Jian rice is scarce, it also follows down by 0.10-0.11 yuan. Bo Dao sells 4,000 bags to Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other groups. There are also Guangdong helpers who buy 300-400 bags. However, because Kejia sees that retail sales are not digested, they all have the intention of not buying small quantities, so the plate is difficult to loosen and is cut by more than 0.20 yuan. Those who handle business in this street even shed more than 0.20 yuan. If the weather is clear, arrivals will continue to surge, and it seems difficult to establish a firm footing. Yin Bian Yuan also presents a soft trend, with a small price of 0.10-0.20 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each route under the river surged, about more than 60. There were 260-270 ships of Heji. Those who went to the market to kill the price of Bai Jing rice were piled up in front of the households, and retail transactions were still sluggish. The market price fell by another 0.20-0.30 yuan. The arrival of Yang Jian goods is still strong, and retail sales are also sluggish. The price is short by 0.20-0.30 feet. Bo Dao, Zao Jing, and Bai Yuan·Bu Jian·Ling Hua are also stagnant. The price of Bai Yuan is small by 0.20 yuan, and the price of Bo Dao is small by 0.20 yuan. The price of Zao Dao Bu Du Jian follows the small corner, and the price of the remaining goods is also small by 0.10-0.20 yuan.</p>
<p>(Ke Xian) The arrival is still active, but Ke Hua has turned stagnant. The Tianjin helpers are only loading rice in storage and have no new transactions. After the hoarders once handled business smoothly, they stopped yesterday and waited and watched. Therefore, the market wind of rice has been frustrated. However, the going to sell on this street is still alive. Chongming also has 140 bags of Hankou machine rice handled to sell. The market price can still stand. In addition to the sale of Hanki rice throughout the city, there are 800 bags of Gan rice, 800 bags of Han rough rice, 1,162 bags of Wen Yong rice, 200 bags of Minxian rice, and 330 bags of Anqing rice. All of them were handled for sale on this street. The import and export of Jinmi is bleak. Yesterday, this street sold 100 bags of Siam rice, because there was a lack of goods, it opened to 9.40 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Rapeseed Still Selling Well to the East <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Western rapeseed only sells to Japan, so there is no formal market. It is heard that there were 40,000 bags of transactions last week, and the market opened to 8.70 yuan. Yesterday, another 15,000 bags were transacted, and the price opened to 9 yuan. Yih Ho had a foreign dealer take 200 tons of Western sesame, and the price was 12 yuan per original plate. Another company once bid a telegram of 12.30 yuan, and whether it can be sold depends on today's reply. The factory's appetite for soybeans continues to increase, and this street's Shantou also has an appetite. A total of 6,500 bags of various beans were opened throughout the city, and the market rose by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market trended flat. The guild's planned plate, 24 crude white spot goods called 22.05 yuan, unchanged. Re-exported goods called 6.95 yuan, a small difference of 0.05 yuan, and the transaction did not take place. This factory's cotton white Zhen Ji No. 1 is still 21 yuan, and the rest of Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 are in arrears. Eastern red and eastern white have not risen or fallen much, but No. 9 YRO Mark is down slightly by 0.05 yuan, and no transaction has taken place. Numbered goods such as Xin Chao Zhi called 12 yuan, and sliced green called 10.50 yuan to 10 yuan are not consistent. Zhang Qing called 10.00 yuan, all of which have seen a fall, because the sales amount is less active and the industry's appetite is not satisfied, resulting in a lack of transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Northern and Southern Goods: Golden Needle Vegetable Number Plate Rises by 0.50 Yuan <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Golden needle vegetables have recently become active in sales. Numbered goods are firmly defended, and the trend is upward. Yesterday, Guangdong bought more than 100 bags of Big Yu vegetables, and the price was 18.5 yuan, followed by 18 yuan. Another number of town helpers opened dozens of bags of top village vegetables, with prices of 19.5 yuan, followed by 19.3 yuan, an increase of 0.50 yuan compared to the previous plate.</p>
<p>Sunflower Seeds Open Up 1 Yuan</p>
<p>Sunflower seeds from Tianjin are the best. Sales in previous years were not strong. Since last year until now, because the production of black melon seeds has declined, this product has risen to prominence and sales have become more prosperous this year, and prices have also increased. Recently, 400-500 bags have been opened, all of which are Tianjin goods, and the price is 12.5 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous plate.</p>

<p>Yesterday, New York silk market spot prices fell sharply by seven cents. Although domestic silk inventory is scarce, trading prices in Shanghai have decreased accordingly. Moreover, recent purchases from American firms have been very sluggish, with all transactions reportedly being made by firms in Lyon.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms' Tea Sales Increasingly Sluggish</p>
<p>The local foreign tea market has become increasingly sluggish recently. The inventory of fine grades of Mei and Pearl tea from the Lu Zhuang Ping Shui area is nearly exhausted. European firms' requests for top and middle grade tea are unmet due to lack of supply. Despite large numbers of sales offers of low-grade tea from French firms, there have been few responses. Yesterday, only firms such as Tongfu, Duddell, Tianyu, and Yongfa purchased about 240 boxes of low-grade Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei Needle, and Shrimp Eye green tea, with market prices remaining stable.</p>

<p>The recent factory transactions for 90-pound and 100-pound American double-strand rails have been very active, and export business is also thriving. The current estimated market price is 40 yuan per box (90-pound double-strand rails) and 48 yuan (100-pound double-strand rails), both up by 4 to 5 yuan compared to previous prices. In recent days, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson and Reiss &amp; Co. have also inquired about market conditions via telegram.</p>

<p>Some lonely people, living in desolate circumstances with no relatives or friends, often raise a cat or a dog in order to find some emotional support. Their love for the cat or dog is much deeper than that of ordinary people; it's almost like treating them as their own lover or children, showing that humans all possess great love, and this love is humanity's only beauty.</p>
<p>Young people certainly cannot lack love, because love is the fertilizer of youth. Therefore, when they have not found an ideal lover, they often feel disoriented and desolate, as if traveling in a desert, even to the point of suffering illness. When they finally find an ideal lover, it's naturally like receiving sweet dew in extreme hunger and thirst. But in this beautiful realm of love, you must not think that it is your final destination. That is to say, you must not forget your own and society's future. You must know that a person who truly understands love and uses it well must expand love from the narrow confines to all of humanity.</p>
<p>In the hearts of Chinese people, the hardest kind of love to find is love for the country. This is one of the greatest shortcomings of the Chinese people, and it is the reason why they suffer. The crux of the matter is that Chinese people only know the benevolence of their parents and do not know that the country is even more benevolent; they only know the beauty of their lover and do not know that the country is even more beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Memorial Arch <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Yunsi</p>
<p>The iron statue of Song Qin Hui by West Lake is a representation of punishing evil, rooting out treachery, and leaving behind a lasting infamy. Conversely, building a memorial archway to leave a fragrance for eternity is a symbol of honoring virtue and rewarding merit. Our Chinese nation is inherently a land of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. How did we used to honor loyal officials, filial sons, chaste widows, and virtuous women? We often erected stone memorial archways as models for later generations. The essence of this lies in the loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace that the current leaders emphasize. In the imperial examination era, fame, position, and wealth were often also displayed on a memorial archway, revealing the social status of the person being honored. For example, even if someone was a successful candidate in the imperial exam, the palace examination and selection would result in those in first place receiving the distinction of "Presented Scholar, Grade A" - this memorial archway would be erected on your behalf by the state. The second and third places, with the distinctions of "Presented Scholar" and "Of Presented Scholar Origin," would not have the same prominence as the first place. In general, these memorial archways were similar to today's bronze statues and memorial halls in that they had longevity. Since the founding of the Republic of China, for every grand celebration, memorial archways have been replaced with painted arches. Most of these are made of pine and cypress branches, adorned with gilded and resplendent large characters on decorative panels. This kind of embellishment for a time of peace and prosperity is treated like worn-out shoes after a short period in office, which is very much in line with the saying "building a house costs three stones of rice, demolishing a house costs one meal." However, because "the boundless scenery is all new at once," this is viewed as commonplace; it only allows bamboo craftsmen and florists to earn some extra income. Now that the times have evolved, the arches erected along the way for this 6th National Games are completely different from the past. They have already shattered the bamboo craftsmen and florists' side income, becoming the design of engineering experts. Although the framework is made of wood, the audience's perspective from afar makes it look like a three-dimensional building made of reinforced concrete. It is said that the cost of each is estimated at 500 yuan. Its purpose is also different from the simple aspirations of the past. It is not just adding color to the games themselves, but another group singing the greatness of this feat. Its side effect is even more "advertisement" on "page two."</p>
<h3 id="e199">Clerk <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Songshan</p>
<p>Just for the recruitment of a clerk who only needs to be able to write a few neat characters and have slightly fluent writing skills, there are so many applicants because of the monthly salary of twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Since I came out of my mother's womb, I have never held a job. Counting it, it's been almost thirty years, but I am increasingly unwilling to loaf around. I really don't have any opportunities. Fortunately, I still have some remaining assets, but eventually, sitting and eating empties the mountain, so I now have to seek a position by any means necessary because my life cannot allow me to continue drifting along.</p>
<p>I am very satisfied with a salary of twenty yuan a month, so I mustered my courage and decided to apply.</p>
<p>The unlucky star hadn't left yet, and it wasn't very auspicious. As soon as I ran out the door, rain suddenly poured down from the sky, and I didn't have any rain gear. I was afraid that I would be late and miss the application time, so I decided to brave the rain. When I arrived, I was soaking wet, as if I had taken a bath. My originally faded blue cloth gown would surely have many more stains this time.</p>
<p>An old gentleman, about fifty years old, with a shiny bald head, was probably the principal. He was very kind and spoke with a smile on the corner of his mouth, perhaps because he knew the distress of the unemployed, so he treated us so sincerely.</p>
<p>There were five test questions, and we were required to submit the papers by 11:40 AM. After many of us finished the exam, the old gentleman busily greeted us with a smile on his face and invited us to the dining hall to eat, saying, "Please have a meal of hardship." I thought, after all, the elders have experience and never act condescendingly. If it were a young man in Western clothes, he would probably have a different face.</p>
<p>All applicants will hear news within three days. If no news is received within the specified date, there is no need to have any illusions. I waited as if I were waiting for an official verdict, but with so many people, choosing one person, my hopes are not very optimistic, but I am still waiting for news.</p>
<p>Time slipped by quickly, and three days had already passed. I had already given up on this idea. Just for the recruitment of a clerk, there are so many applicants. Choosing one person from among so many, naturally the best will be chosen. There must be such talent, but it just wasn't my turn.</p>

<p>Chapter 21: Tender and Gentle, She Takes Pity on His Moonlike Face; With Passionate Zeal, He Trains His Son-in-Law, Listening to the Roar from the Next Room</p>
<p>After listening to him, Zhiqian put his hands behind his back and kept pacing back and forth in the room. Smiling and nodding, he said, "I'm afraid you don't know the details of this matter. People will submit to anything for money. Even that guy named Jia, you see him strutting around with his nose in the air, thinking he's a big deal. But one day, for the sake of money, when someone wants to oppress him, he will have to endure it. I'll give you an example," he said, lowering his voice, "a little bureau chief has just moved into the room next door, also a compradore-type figure. He was very comfortable in Jiangnan, but for the sake of money, he went to Gansu and served as the head of the tax bureau in a very difficult place for a year. It doesn't matter that he goes to suffer. His fashionable wife in Jiangnan sent a telegram, summoning him to Xi'an to meet. The bureau chief arrived here a day earlier, and yesterday, his wife also came. In the evening, because there were no electric lights, the couple had a quarrel. The wife first said that she wanted him to send money to Xi'an. The bureau chief said that he came in a hurry and didn't have time to raise funds. If she wants money, she can go to Gansu with him. The wife anticipated the hardship and hasn't agreed yet. However, I think she will definitely go. The reason is very simple, because there is money in that place." Saying this, he smiled. At this moment, he saw a young woman in a Western suit, her high heels clicking on the ground as she passed by. Her upper garment was pink, covered with a short, thin blue woolen coat. Below was a sapphire blue skirt, swaying as she walked, with great charm. There are not many women in Xi'an who have their hair cut short, and her hair is curled in waves. Although he didn't see the woman's face, he could say with certainty that she was very beautiful. Immediately, he heard the woman speaking angrily in the next room. (364)</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Straight Crease of Western Trousers <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Dexian</p>
<p>We often see people wearing Western suits, and they always like to have a very straight crease ironed on their trousers, facing the front and back. To maintain this crease for a long time, they mostly use serge or wool as the clothing material. I ask, how does this crease come about, and what is its purpose? I think everyone must want to know about this!</p>
<p>It is said that this was during the time when George Washington, the first elected President of the United States in the 18th century, was in office. Once, the presidential palace held a meeting, and all the congressmen arrived at the venue, but Washington had not yet arrived. After several reminders, Washington hurriedly changed into newly washed clothes and came to the venue. The crowd saw that the president's clothes had neat creases, and they all followed suit. This accidental imitation opened the way for the fashion of ironing very obvious creases on Western suits in later generations.</p>
<p>There are many such things. For example, recently, fashionable women in Shanghai paint their cheeks yellow, imitating a foreign movie star. From this, it can be seen how closely the actions of celebrities are related to social customs and folkways. It can also be inferred that many social phenomena are not exhaustively understood, but most are the result of this accidental imitation. Therefore, many problems that cannot be solved recently are attributed to this principle!</p>

<h3 id="e203">Improvised Notes on Mount Huang (Part 2) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaodie</p>
<p>The beauty of Sanhua Dock must be seen from in front of the Brush Rack Peak, facing the Three Great Buddhas on the left, the Stone Bamboo Shoot Ridge on the right, and Rongcheng Peak in front. Only by sitting and admiring the blooming brush can the magical scenery be truly revealed. The wonders seen from Beginning-to-Believe Peak can all be seen from Sanhua Dock, but the wonders of Sanhua Dock cannot be seen from Beginning-to-Believe Peak. However, the mountain path has been blocked for a long time, with brambles and thorns all over the mountain, as tall as people, and the mountain mud is slippery and offers no foothold. I followed Master Weiqing in climbing up and sliding down, falling and rolling. Fortunately, we reached halfway, but we still hadn't reached the old site of Sanhua Temple. Yi Yan said that opening this road would cost no more than a hundred yuan, but I think this road should be divided into three paths: one descending from the Blooming Dream Brush to view the waterfall, one descending from the Lower Liu Pavilion to view the stone bamboo shoots, and one ascending from Songgu Temple to view the Dragon Pool. Then the hidden treasures of heaven and earth can seem to be fully revealed. I sincerely hope to work with those who have the intention to accomplish this.</p>
<p>The imposing scenery of the West Sea is magnificent, with towering cliffs and countless doors. In my opinion, it is the best of Mount Huang. What is particularly striking is that on the West Sea Gate, in the Pine Forest Ridge, all ten thousand pine trees grow together, with four branches connecting each other, mostly as thick as a person can embrace, completely different from the Tian Du Lotus. Azaleas and rhododendrons are especially abundant like a sea. If it were springtime, the brilliance would be indescribable. Such a magical scene is not even mentioned in the Mount Huang map. I think that if this place were developed to accommodate new village construction, so that every family could lean on the pine trees with connecting branches and sit in the sea of azalea flowers, it would add another beautiful tale beyond the Peach Blossom Spring of Wuling.</p>
<p>Those who carry people up Mount Huang are not well-trained, so their gait is not very neat. The construction of mountain sedan chairs is best in Mount Tai, but the porters are unrivaled in Mount Lu. Those who are considered difficult on Mount Huang, if entrusted to the porters of Mount Lu, would be as effortless as walking on flat ground. However, the sedan chairs of Mount Lu are carried by four people, so if one person falls, there are still six feet to hold on. Even if two people in the front and back fall, it is the same as the sedan chair on Mount Huang. Mount Tianmu, though easy, is also carried by four people. This is worth learning from.</p>
<p>Mount Huang is more than 7,000 feet high, but the sunrise can only be viewed from Bright Summit. From Wen Shu Monastery, the view is blocked by Jade Screen Peak, and from Qingliang Terrace, the view is blocked by Rongcheng Peak. Moreover, there is no shelter from a single oak tree on Bright Summit, and if one stays overnight near Lion Grove, the cold will be unbearable. I propose building a stone staircase on Jade Screen Peak to reach the top of Jade Screen, so that the sunrise will become a "Salt Pond," properly located at the "Heavenly Capital" and surely offer spectacular views. Moreover, it is close behind Wen Shu Monastery, which reduces the hardship of the journey and yields a great achievement in sightseeing. Yi Xin is convinced that its value is no more than a hundred gold.</p>
<p>The Mount Huang renovation has been economical and has achieved great things, but it relies on donations from mountain monks, which easily makes tourists hesitant. I think the collection books in each temple can be abolished. But in places where scenery needs to be arranged, verbal guidance should be given to allow elegant gentlemen to voluntarily donate, and the construction drawings and development locations must still be approved by the Construction Committee. Wouldn't that be good? I once calculated that building a stone staircase on Jade Screen Mountain would allow people to view the sunrise, opening a mountain path on Sanhua Dock would allow people to fully see the wonders of Stone Bamboo Shoot Ridge and Beginning-to-Believe Peak, and building five stone houses south of Qingliang Terrace would allow tourists to rest and enjoy the sea of clouds. I discussed this with Monk Xin Ding of Wen Shu Monastery and Monk Weiqing of the forest, and the total cost of this plan would be about 3,000 yuan in legal tender, which could be completed. However, in this time of economic decline, it is difficult to raise funds independently, and tens of millions of people nationwide are waiting for disaster relief, so I am unwilling to focus solely on leisurely sightseeing, which is not urgent. Therefore, I intend to spend a month creating fifty paintings, and use half of the proceeds from the sale of the paintings to fund disaster relief, and use the other half to help fund the construction of Mount Huang. I wonder if you gentlemen of great refinement can help me achieve this goal?</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Reader's Note</p>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Records of Fragrant Mists of the Imperial Court," a novelistic account of the private life of Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty, finally finished its serialization yesterday. It was serialized for a total of 459 days, because not much could be published each day, which dragged it out for so long.</p>
<p>From the perspective of those of us who study novels, this book is indeed quite valuable. At the very least, it is very interesting. However, it fundamentally does not bear the mission of instructing life or representing the appeals of a certain class, so it cannot be said to have any consciousness.</p>
<p>During the period of translation, the translator received repeated assistance and guidance from Mrs. Tang Baochao (i.e., Princess Rong Ling), Mr. Yu Xunling, Mr. Tang Yunfan, and my brother Zeng Wei, and was also corrected from time to time by the readers, for which I am very grateful. What was especially fortunate was that the original author, Princess Der Ling, came to Shanghai and also corrected a few points herself, making the translation not only fully consistent with the original, but even more complete than the original.</p>
<p>Three months ago, Mr. Ma Yinliang, Mr. Zhou Shoujuan, and Mr. Huang Jiping of this newspaper informed me that because many readers were requesting reprints, and to give the effort I had put in over the past year and a half more purpose, they wanted me to reorganize, revise, and supplement the entire book so that a single-volume edition could be published in the shortest possible time. This was naturally something I was very happy to do, so I devoted more than twenty days to thoroughly reviewing and correcting it. Now it is finally finished. The illustrations in the book will also be enlarged or colorized. It is expected to be published next month.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Premature Aging <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zinan</p>
<p>Premature aging is one of the terminal illnesses of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>"Mature for his age" is the best compliment. The speaker strokes his beard and smiles, and the listener also has a pleased expression. And the person being praised, at this time, sits even more upright, becoming "mature" beyond measure.</p>
<p>A child who has just learned to walk is dressed in long robes and short jackets. When the child wants to play, he is pulled back and severely reprimanded.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the age of twenty, they begin to prepare for "longevity"; even longevity clothes, coffins, and burial grounds are being prepared.</p>
<p>"They hope for nothing but a stable life. Something in them, such as 'death is the meaningful moment of life,' and 'in the second half of human life, the normal psychology is the psychology of preparing for death.' Because of such assertions, death is regarded as a primitive idea, and they live a secluded life." (Gorky: On Drama.)</p>
<p>In China, the so-called "second half of human life" seems to come particularly early. Therefore, the so-called "preparation for death" is also "prepared" early, and "because of such assertions, death is regarded as a primitive idea, and they live a secluded life." Therefore, the desire to live a "secluded life" also comes particularly early, and because of the desire to live a "secluded life" early, "mature for his age" becomes the best "award" for young people.</p>
<p>Chinese people start preparing for death from the moment they are born. The so-called "prepare a coffin at the age of three, it will be useful when old" is exactly that.</p>
<p>However, this is truly the crystallization of the dying social psychology of aging petty citizens.</p>
<p>In response to this dying social psychology, we can look at Mr. Akita Ujaku's words: "Look, I am only in my fifties, compared to people in their sixties, I am still just a child."</p>
<p>Let's also look at Gide, Gorky, and Romain Rolland, who are "in their sixties," and how they are working hard for the future of humanity.</p>
<p>These are such good contrasts and such good lessons compared to the prematurely aging people who encourage "mature for his age"!</p>
<p>"We simply do not think about the time of death; we seize life from our own hands and guard it more quietly. It is extremely difficult work to fully open one's will and reason and value the constant heroic tension."</p>
<p>In a stagnant, prematurely aging society, this is truly the best remedy. We only have the right to survive in this society if we "seize life from our own hands and guard it more quietly."</p>
<p>However, "in our midst, there are still the unburied dead. They also eat, drink, walk on the streets, and breathe."</p>
<p>Moreover, before this prematurely aging society perishes, they will still "eat, drink, walk on the streets, and breathe," emitting a decaying miasma.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Winter <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Speaking of winter, some people will worry about it, while others will be very happy. The four seasons of the year do not inherently possess fixed advantages or disadvantages. The decision of love or hate depends entirely on one's environment, age, and breadth of mind. Each season follows the course of nature, alternating in cycles. To love spring and hate winter means enduring patiently, waiting for spring to arrive early and winter to pass quickly.</p>
<p>Now, the high-altitude hunting weather of the ninth month of autumn has finally completed its course in the seasons. According to the lunar calendar, it is the middle of October. Even if the weather hasn't become severely cold, and the north wind hasn't blown down snowflakes, according to the progression of the seasons, this boundless earth has already changed into a winter coat. In the near future, nature will gradually reveal winter's stern and cold face.</p>
<p>If the warm October weather in Jiangnan were seen by northerners, they might resent that nature is so partial, favoring one over the other. In the north, there is an ancient poem describing winter: "In the tenth month in barbarian lands, snow already flies." Though the seasonal segment is still early winter, October, it has lost the name and reality of early winter. Not long ago, Shanghai newspapers reported the blooming of winter peach blossoms. If this news were to reach the north, it would surely astonish and puzzle people, perhaps even leading to superstition, claiming it as an auspicious sign of a good year. Similar stories can be found in historical records. October is called Little Yangchun (Indian Summer), likely originating from this.</p>
<p>In my southern hometown, it doesn't snow in winter, and the trees remain evergreen throughout the year. The so-called Little Yangchun of October is much more deserving of the name. Many vegetable trees, such as peach, apricot, loquat, and pomegranate, will bloom at this time, but they rarely bear fruit. The only one that often bears fruit is the pomegranate, but not much, and the fruit is smaller and more astringent than those that ripen in summer. However, being able to obtain this summer fruit in early winter, October, naturally makes it seem more precious than usual.</p>
<p>If there is no snowy scenery to view in winter, it is naturally very dry, but the loveliness of winter lies precisely in this. A snowy day makes the north wind lose its majesty. The forest, standing all day in the howling northern wind, will dream more beautifully and sweetly of the spring buried in its branches. In the boundless, snow-white scenery, the beautiful face of winter is fully revealed. We do not see its desolation and ferocity, only boundless grandeur and radiance. Such a winter is out of the question in my southern hometown. However, the children there also feel that the arrival of winter is worth praising and welcoming, because what follows winter is still a more wonderful spring, and the universally celebrated, joyous New Year. Although they are not as fortunate as the children in Jiangnan and the North, who can have snowball fights in winter (the southern people are also warlike from a young age), they have dreams of New Year's joy constantly looming in their little minds, so they don't find the winter days too difficult to endure.</p>
<p>The Chinese New Year and the Western Christmas are both for children and are both set in winter, which greatly adds to the liveliness and vibrancy of winter. With snowy scenery, New Year, and Christmas in a cold and formidable winter, could one still be lonely?</p>
<p>The weather has suddenly turned cold in the past few days, and the sky filled with dense clouds looks like it's about to snow. Outside the window, the tung tree leaves appear even drier, more yellow, and weakly waiting to fall. The north wind sweeps across the overhead power lines, making a whooshing sound. Like hearing the footsteps of an old friend, a nameless comfort and joy suddenly rises in my heart. Winter, I have had an acquaintance with it. Now, I am indeed watching it stand gently before the window with a warm and affectionate smile.</p>
<p>Yes, winter has gently come to my door with an affectionate smile. At night, sitting alone in deep thought, I hear it knocking on my door with a very familiar tune and rhythm. It's a pity that there isn't a door knocker on the door, and there's a lack of an iron horse under the eaves. Otherwise, it would surely rock and beat out a very beautiful melody for me.</p>
<p>Winter has come. I believe my dreams will be more realistic, more beautiful, and more radiant.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Crow <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>Perhaps this is my own peculiarity. I don't love orioles, I don't love yellow birds, but I love owls, but I love crows. The crow is a kind of bird that cannot please people, but the reason why I like it is because it cannot please people.</p>
<p>However, when I was young, I really hated crows. I hated that I could not exterminate them all. Behind my house, there were many elm trees and Chinese tallow trees. Among them, the one growing in the northwest corner was the largest and most majestic. There was a crow's nest on it. From the time I had memories, this crow's nest was always standing on that Chinese tallow tree, no matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter. In winter, the leaves had all fallen, so the crow's nest on the towering Chinese tallow tree could be seen from two or three miles away. If someone came to my house, and if they did not know the way, then they would ask a passerby. The passerby would say, "Oh, the Wen family? It's right there, in that big orchard with the crow's nest on the tall Chinese tallow tree." At the same time, they would point remotely with their hand. The visitor only needed to look for it according to what the passerby said.</p>
<p>Crows are considered unlucky things, so when we children heard a crow call, we would respond with the three words "Da Jia Hao" (which sounds similar to the crow's call) in a calm manner, or we would say, "Sharpen the scissors, kill the old crow!" "Boil the water, soak the old crow!" (Old crows are commonly referred to in my hometown.) to intimidate it. If it did not fly away, we would use long bamboo poles to intimidate it. In fact, we children did not understand anything. We only heard the elders say that a crow's call was an ominous sign, so we competed to be afraid. As soon as we heard a crow call, it seemed as if some danger would fall. We used words like "Sharpen the scissors" to intimidate the crow, but our mother often used the crow to intimidate us. For example, if we were playing happily, our mother would come over and say, "Jumping and jumping, having fun! A crow just called. I know you're all going to get beaten!" Then we would disperse, shouting, "Crow call, bad luck comes." Crow call, bad luck comes. (Bad luck, unfortunate news.) Sometimes, if we accidentally broke something, then we would really get beaten, but while enduring the pain with tears, we thought, "It's all the crow's fault. I must kill it!" Then we would clench our fists, showing a very determined look.</p>
<p>When I was young, I hated crows the same way. As I grew older and drifted in the city for many years, I gradually forgot that there was such a thing as a crow. This summer, I returned to my hometown and saw that the Chinese tallow tree was gone. Then I thought of that crow's nest. I asked my siblings who were about the same age, and they all said, "I don't know. That tree was cut down many years ago." They had probably forgotten their childhood long ago. I was just indifferent and didn't want to ask anything more.</p>
<p>After arriving here, I didn't think about crows either. But after all, it's late autumn and early winter now. In front of the school is the Confucius Forest, and my dormitory is behind the Confucius Temple. There are also several very large ginkgo trees behind the temple. So when I went out for a walk in the evening, I saw countless crows, their backs stained with the sunset, squawking in the Confucius Forest. At dawn, I again saw crows on the old ginkgo trees, their backs stained with the morning sun, squawking. However, I did not hate them, and of course, I did not have the childishness to say words like "Sharpen the scissors." I just felt a faint sadness attacking me. Sometimes, as I listened, listened, I almost suspected that the crow's call was my own voice.</p>
<p>These days it has been raining lightly, and the crows are especially loud. I am often disturbed by their squawking and have to put down the test papers I am grading and wander under the old ginkgo tree, humming in a low voice Nalan Xingde's poem: "The crows are gone, standing alone, who is to blame? The sudden snow turns the incense pavilion into catkins, the gentle breeze blows the prunus in the vase, and my heart is already ashes!" In silence, I feel that I am truly a crow. The crow, black all over, is a symbol of extreme sadness. Its being hated is not without reason. But at this moment, do I have a reason to hate it?</p>
<p>Listening to the crow's voice in the cold north wind - caw - caw - caw - how is it compared to reading a sad poem? From this, I understand that the oriole's and the yellow bird's being loved is not without reason either. There is really no need to stand up for the crow's being disliked, because it should be disliked.</p>

<p>The Smiling Girl</p>
<p>In the dead of night, walking on the street, people come and go, flowing like water. In the dark alleys, a chorus of females, warbling like birds, giggling and chuckling, big and small, gaudy and green, beautiful and charming, pure and graceful, each adorned like a flower, with red sleeves. How hateful: the frivolous butterflies and mad bees, heartlessly ravaging, shamelessly insulting. The pain of ten months of pregnancy is in the mother's heart, so heartless and cruel, I advise you to reduce your cruelty. The people in the pit of fire, quickly save yourselves! Save yourselves! Save yourselves! Walk towards the bright path.</p>
<p>Dance halls and theaters, guesthouses and wine shops, crowded and bustling, carefree and unaware of sorrow. Graceful girls, considerate and gentle, exchanging glances, being intimate, tall and short, fat and thin, singing and dancing, swaying and twisting, each filled with boundless joy, hoarding it in their hearts. How pitiful: the bright flowers, heartlessly plucked, shamelessly caressed. The youthful years have long since flowed eastward, conscienceless and insane, I advise you to reduce your cruelty. The people in hell, quickly save yourselves! Save yourselves! Save yourselves! Walk towards the bright path.</p>

<p>In the bright spring, the most exciting thing is the peach blossoms. The bright and red color really makes people feel the preciousness of youth and the loveliness of nature. However, when the ruthless east wind blows, these poor peach blossoms wither. They drift aimlessly, allowing people to trample and play with them.</p>
<p>The scriptwriter of "Peach Blossoms After the Robbery" is the playwright Mr. Hong Shen, who studied in the United States. It was published in the "Literature" magazine in the past. Now, the Star Film Company is producing it into a film, directed by Zhang Shichuan, starring Hu Die and Gao Zhanfei. In "Peach Blossoms After the Robbery," the dream of the rise and fall of the homeland and the vicissitudes of personnel are all contained. As soon as the filming is completed, it can be presented to the audience. Wait for it!</p>

<p>——Screened at the Grand Cathay——</p>
<p>Because of government orders, major Hollywood film companies produced a lot of bandit suppression films in 1935. The ones that have already been screened in Shanghai include Warner's "G-Men", Paramount's "The Lives of a Bengal Lancer", MGM's "The Great God Gold", and United Artists' "The Prisoner of Shark Island". From the perspective of both public opinion and box office, "G-Men" is of course the best. Now, Warner, the company that produced "G-Men," is once again showing its courage and filming "Special Agent," still directed by William Keighley, starring Bette Davis and George Brent. In "G-Men," hard machine guns are used to deal with the gangsters, but in "Special Agent," in addition to the hard machine guns, there are also soft women helping to probe for information and expose all the dark secrets in the bandit den. Therefore, the audience not only has fierce gunfights to watch, but also the wit of the female detective and the gangsters. This film is being screened at the Grand Cathay starting today. The left is the battlefield scene of the film.</p>

<p>Set designer Liu Jin-san died, and the Chinese film circle lost another one.</p>
<p>Liu Jin-san's death, according to reports, was due to "overwork," which is a complete "martyrdom to art."</p>
<p>But, apart from the people in the circle mourning together, how many movie fans outside the circle can sigh for it?</p>
<p>Those who work in drama want to do front-of-house work, and those who work in film want to be stars, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>Chinese films will only have hope when set designers, photographers, and other people all become the objects of movie fans.</p>
<p>It is rumored that "Little Song Zi's" "Love Letter" has been "made public," saying that the first shot is Ye Qiuxin writing a "Love Letter."

As for the role originally played by Ye Qiuxin, it has been changed to Gu Lanjun.</p>

<p>— Shadowy Stalker</p>
<p>Japan's automobile industry. In recent years. Undoubtedly. Has made considerable progress. Their products. Numerically. Are increasing year by year. Not only in the domestic automobile market. Has it established a considerable position. Even in overseas markets. Starting with Eastern countries first. They are also vigorously promoting sales. Therefore. In the near future. Japan's automobile industry. Will have tremendous development. We can foresee this. However, from another perspective. Japan's automobile industry. Compared with Britain and the United States. Still seems very immature. In terms of products. It is certainly not as good as Britain and the United States. And the Japanese automobile factories. Currently only manufacture small cars. Only because the price is particularly low. Can they still be sold to Eastern countries. Otherwise, it would be difficult to compete in the world market.</p>
<p>The two giants of the American automobile industry. General Motors and Ford. Have branches everywhere overseas. In Japan. These two major car manufacturers. Also had branches established long ago. Their only purpose in establishing branches in various overseas countries. Is of course to reduce production costs. In overseas automobile markets. It is easier to promote sales. And among the same industry. Competition is also easier to win. Therefore. The establishment of this kind of branch. Although it has great benefits for oneself. For the host country. To put it bluntly. It is nothing more than a kind of economic aggression.</p>
<p>In Japan. A few years ago, there was basically no so-called automobile industry. Exactly the same as China at present. Completely no self-made cars. Therefore. Not much attention was paid to the establishment of factories by General Motors and Ford. But in recent years. Japan's automobile industry. Is rising. As mentioned above. Japanese automobile factories. In recent years, they have been limited to manufacturing small cars. But aren't Chevrolet from General Motors and V8 from Ford. Both low-priced small cars? Therefore. General Motors and Ford. Since there are branches in Japan. The result will certainly cause considerable impact and threat to the Japanese automobile industry. It will not be easy to rise.</p>
<p>Japan certainly will not ignore this issue. Therefore. The government. To protect the domestic automobile industry. Formulated a car industry bill. The most important two restrictions on foreign companies setting up factories in Japan are: (1) From now on. No new factories. Absolutely prohibited. Even factories that have already been established. After August 9 this year. No expansion of any equipment is allowed. (2) But if the company's capital. More than half is transferred to Japanese nationals. And the company's control is also transferred to the Japanese at the same time. The government may allow it to expand or add car plants. After reading the above clauses. We can clearly see the Japanese government's intention. To restrict the activities of foreign automobile factories establishing branches in Japan. It is tantamount to putting shackles on the heads of General Motors and Ford's Japanese branches. It is said that it will be implemented immediately after the next parliament passes it.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese government formulated this car industry bill. Ford. Expressed opposition. However, General Motors has expressed its willingness to merge with Nissan Motor Company. Nissan is considered to be one of the largest car factories in Japan. For the sake of various conveniences. General Motors also had talks with Nissan about cooperation last year. Therefore. The formulation of this car industry bill. Makes the merger of General Motors and Nissan even more possible. Currently, General Motors. Has drafted two solutions. (1) Transfer all company assets to Nissan. (2) Transfer 51% of the stock to Nissan. Important personnel from both sides. Have had many talks. But no decision has been made yet. And Nissan. Has to be instructed by the government. Only then can everything be decided. Presumably the merger of General Motors and Nissan. May become a reality. But it is only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Jenkins Plans to Break Campbell's Record. Since the Englishman Sir Malcolm Campbell achieved a car speed of 300 miles per hour, car racers around the world have admired him greatly. Now, there is a famous car racer named Jenkins in the southern United States. He is already planning a new racing car, preparing to break Campbell's record. His desired speed is 400 miles per hour, an increase of 100 miles compared to Campbell. The racing location is scheduled on the salt flats of Bonneville, Utah, around next autumn. Jenkins is currently in the hospital due to an injury and broken bones he sustained recently while racing in Nashville. He is a renowned racer, having won over 300 racing championships. The new racing car he is planning will have 24 cylinders, intending to surpass any land speed record. According to him, the car's horsepower is 3,600, while Campbell's engine only has 2,400 horsepower. It is propelled by four-wheel drive. He also said that the car is more streamlined than Campbell's "Bluebird." Each wheel is equipped with fin-like plates, ensuring that the wheels remain glued to the ground even at maximum speed. These plates can be adjusted, so whether a wheel needs more power or during turns, the plate can help it adhere tightly to the ground. Jenkins believes that the car can reach a speed of 400 miles per hour, or at least 350 miles per hour, gradually progressing to 400 miles per hour. He also believes that this will bring the world's highest car speed record back to the United States. The car's wheelbase is 170 inches. He estimates the engine's weight to be between 8,000 and 10,000 pounds. As for the Bonneville racing track, it is said to be the most perfect in the world, so he firmly believes that his wishes will not be in vain.</p>
<p>American Car Production in Nine Months. From January to September of this year, member factories of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association manufactured a total of 2,029,406 vehicles. This is a 15% increase compared to the same period last year. This number includes various passenger cars and trucks. However, it should be clarified that Ford's production is not included in the above total. Apart from that, almost all major manufacturers are included. The car production volume in September was relatively the lowest this year. According to the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, this is because car factories are preparing for the 1936 model cars. The new cars are planned to be unveiled at the National Automobile Show on November 2nd. According to the association's initial report, the car production volume in September was 57,860 vehicles, a 68% decrease compared to the 179,918 vehicles in August.

<h3 id="e221">What to Do When a Tire Goes Flat <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Xue</p>
<p>Nowadays. Flat tires occurring unexpectedly. Happen very rarely. Normally speaking, if a hole is small. The air inside a balloon tire. Will of course not leak out quickly. Sometimes the driver notices the tire damage. Only after the car has driven for quite a distance after the tire has been damaged.</p>
<p>Even if the tire has such a hole. The car is still easy to drive. Because the air leaks out very slowly. In other words, the warning period is very long. If the driver is paying attention to the car body. He will feel vibrations while driving. These vibrations are due to the air leaking from the tire. At that time, he can change the wheel before the pressure is completely released.</p>
<p>There is one thing that must be especially stated here. That is, before changing the wheel. The car must be driven off the main road. We often see people changing wheels on narrow and busy roads. This not only obstructs traffic. And because of other vehicles coming and going. He is in danger of being knocked down. It is best to drive the car to a small road or corner away from the main road. When looking for this kind of small road or corner, you have to drive slower. Even driving for a mile or so. It will not harm the tires. Now new cars have permanently installed jacks. This is a great help when changing wheels. Not only can the wheel be changed quickly. And safe.</p>
<p>Sudden tire blowouts also happen. However, this tire must have been very weak to begin with. Or the tire casing has been carelessly used. For example. When a car drives over a sharp curb. The structure of the cords inside the tire casing will be damaged. If the tire is still used after being injured like this. The injured area is easily enlarged. Sometimes it even bulges outward. It is also very clear to see from the outside. If the car owner does not check his tires at that time. The air will bulge out from the weak spot. And the tire will deflate immediately.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned blowouts. Sometimes when a car accidentally drives over an inconspicuous obstacle. The air in the tire will suddenly leak out from a crack. But this happens very rarely. Therefore. Generally speaking. As long as we pay good attention to the tires. Blowouts will not happen.</p>
<p>However, drivers should know what to do in case a tire is damaged. Due to the sudden deflation. The rolling resistance of the tire will greatly increase. So the car is very easy to deviate from its normal course. If the damaged one is the front tire. Deviation is even more likely to occur. On wet roads. And it will also slip.</p>
<p>If the driver can hold the steering wheel steady. Even if there is unstable steering. It can usually be corrected immediately. As long as you use the appropriate force. Even if the steering mechanism vibrates. It is not difficult to make the car drive in the correct direction. Drivers sometimes drive very fast and only put one finger and thumb on the edge of the steering wheel. At that time, if the tire suddenly breaks down. It is impossible to avoid the danger of unstable steering.</p>
<p>In any emergency on the road. Ordinary people always apply the brakes vigorously first. But when a tire suddenly breaks down. This method must not be used. The function of the brakes is to hinder the movement of the wheels. So when the tire blows out, use the brakes. The result will separate the tire casing from the tire ring. This not only causes avoidable damage to the tire. And the metal tire ring rubs on the road. Strengthening the incorrect steering force. Even wrecking the wheel.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the tire is damaged and the situation requires the car to be driven slowly. For example, on a hillside. Then applying the brakes should be as gentle as possible. At the same time, the driver must hold the steering wheel tightly.</p>
<h3 id="e222">General Overview of Guangxi Highways <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Future Plans for Constructing Provincial Roads</p>
<p>Although Guangxi has over 12,000 li of completed highways. The routes in various regions are not fully connected. Water and land transportation. Are not fully connected to the main lines out of the province. The main lines out of the province are not fully connected. Future plans for constructing provincial roads. Externally, the main lines out of the province should continue to be completed. Internally, the routes in various regions should be connected and connected to major rivers. All provincial roads that should continue to be constructed have been predetermined and planned. They will be constructed in five years. In order to gradually complete them.</p>
<p>Roads to be Completed in the First Year</p>
<p>(1) Expedite the Qin Section of the Yongqin Road. This road starts from Tingzixu on the opposite bank of the Yonghe River to Wucun. It branches off from the Yonglong Road. From here, it travels south through Datang and Naxiao to the border of the province, Cekuangkui Xu. It connects to Guangdong Province via Xiaodong. To reach Qinzhou. It is the shortest and most important route for highways in southwestern provinces to reach the sea. This road is 220 li long within Guangxi. Although it is now fully open to traffic. The remaining 50 li from Dongkuang to Xiaodong within Qinxian has not yet been constructed. Over the years, we have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams urging. And repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate. And willing to allocate funds to assist. In order to complete it as soon as possible. But it has not yet been settled. This autumn, we will send personnel again to discuss solutions. Strive to complete it as soon as possible. So that the highways of the southwestern provinces. Reach the seaport early. To enrich the economy and strengthen national defense.</p>
<p>(2) Complete the Liuyong Road. This road is 180 li long. It is a branch of the Liugui Highway. It is also the middle section of the Liugui Road after the realignment. After the road is completed, the Liugui transportation will be 140 li shorter than the current Liuligui route. Both time and car costs are reduced and saved. Before the 16th year of the Republic of China, it was repeatedly surveyed. Only because of the obstruction of streams and rivers. The mountains are steep. The cost is huge and construction has been delayed for a long time. Recently, due to various needs. It needs to be completed urgently. Therefore, Changtang Village on the Liujiang River and the bridgehead of Dabai Lake were selected as the starting point. It passes through Huangmian, Sanlipo Village, and Ailing to Yongfu. It connects with the Guiyong Road. In February of this year, personnel were sent to measure. Construction is now starting from Changsanduan first. The entire line can be completed and open to traffic this year.</p>
<p>(3) Construct the Baidu Road. This road starts from Baise, passes through Luoli, Tianxi, Jiuzhou, and reaches the bank of the Badu River. It is 450 li long. The Badu River crosses into Ceheng in Guizhou. Passing through Anlong and Xingyi, it can reach Guiyang in the north. It connects to Kunming in the west. After this road is connected. The three provinces' political, military, cultural, and other aspects. Rely heavily on mutual assistance. And passengers and goods from Yunnan and Guizhou. Can also enter and exit through this line. The importance of the relationship. Should be on the Danchi Road that has been opened to traffic. And the Bailuo Road that will be built. The Bailuo and Danchi roads are limited to local transportation. Unable to connect the three provinces. To the line from Baidu into Guizhou and then into Yunnan. Within Guangxi, the land is relatively wide and flat along the way. And mostly clay. Therefore, although the route is more than twice as long as the Bailuo line. The required funds are only about 600,000 yuan more than the Bailuo line. The remaining section from Badu to Kunming. The project belongs to Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. Currently, the routes in both Yunnan and Guizhou have been under construction. At present, it has a rough scale and can be completed and opened to traffic this year. As for the line from Baise through Luoli, Tianxi, Jiuzhou, to Anlong and Xingyi in Guizhou Province and into Luoping in Yunnan Province. This was originally the Dianyu Railway. The original planned route of the Dianbai section. Now build a highway first. Then the construction of the railway in the future. The project will be easier to carry out. Therefore, after July of this year. Speed up the progress immediately. In order to complete and open to traffic in the autumn of next year.</p>
