<h3 id="c14">英國大選揭曉 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>英國本屆大選結果業已揭曉。各黨所獲席數不出一般人之預測。國民政府於衆院多佔二百五十席左右。此種優勢。論者謂爲一八三一年大改革案以來所僅見。而選民之實行投票者逾七成。亦爲英人於世界多事之秋特別關懷國事之明證。鮑爾溫首相於選舉形勢確定之夕。將黽勉從事於國家復興及世界和平之二大志願。昭吿其國人工。黨領袖阿特里及莫利生輩對選舉結果之失望。亦已慨乎言之。是則今後五年中。英國之內政外交。將仍以新保守主義爲其指導精神矣。</p>
<p>今次選舉。表面上雖爲維持國民政府與回復政黨內閣之爭。實則不過保守黨與工黨二大主力之鬥爭。鮑爾溫以其個人之聲望。利用國際時局。突然宣布提早改選。個中作用一在藉外交以固政權。一在藉民衆之重新擁戴。以增强外交上戢止東菲戰爭之力量。內政外交息息呼應。固近代政治之原則也。</p>
<p>惟就工黨而言。在本屆實已陷於窘境。其下院領袖藍斯伯禮及上院領袖葛禮普施纔以反對制裁而辭職。工黨內部裂痕迄未復原。黨中頗難找得出任揆席之人物。此爲工黨策略上之一大弱點。况英國今日經濟狀况。富裕甲全歐。較之一九三一年時之貧乏。相差不可以道里計。工黨今次之不得勢。亦環境使然耳。</p>
<p>然本屆總選。工黨固早知無力攫取政權。惟尙有可爭者在。卽政府黨在衆院保持其極大多數。乃有關民治制度「矯正與均衡」原則之問題。足資反對黨藉口。以打動愛好民治之英人之心弦。故競選演說時勞合喬治曾云。「茍再見膨脹的多數出現。則危險孰甚。」史諾登亦云。「選舉結果若再任政府得一不可控制之多數。不僅爲國家之大患。亦且國際之禍害。」今觀選舉結果。保守黨已自四百七十一席降至三百八十三席。工黨亦自五十二席增至一百五十四席。可知反對黨實不得謂爲絕對失敗也。</p>
<p>吾人總觀全局。以地域論。大都市及鄉區多屬保守黨勢力。工業區大半屬工黨。惟亦有因保護關稅及軍需擴充有利於國內工商業之故。而傾向保守黨者。工黨本屆未能在成爾斯·蘇格蘭·及北方工業區域「收復失地。」實大威失望者也。更以人事論麥唐納之落選。與一九三一年勞合喬治所遭之命運。如出一轍。可謂又「了結」一政治巨頭矣。反政府自由黨領袖薩穆爾本屆完全失敗。隸屬政府之自由黨領袖西門雖仍當選。而其所得票數。一落千丈。於此可證自由主義在英國益趨沒落在另一方面號稱「工黨之强」之莫利生曾於一九三一年落選。今復入國會。可爲工黨再起之朕兆。而今後英國政治舞臺將保持兩黨制。亦益爲明顯。至於內閣之改組。爲必然之趨。勢聞內定以大海軍主義者溫斯敦邱吉爾繼任海相。另以國際外交界嶄然露頭角之艾登。調任陸相或殖民部大臣。是則充實國防與團結屬地。將爲今後英國政治之基調矣。</p>

<h3 id="c84">敎育實施敎育播音的經過 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 敎育部科長徐逸樵</p>
<p>一·今次教育播音的節目所講的是「教育部實施教育播音的經過，」因爲本部自雙十節開始教育播音以來，雖然已經連續的播送過二十多次，但是關於本部實施教育播音的意義和經過，還沒有對大家說過，所以認爲應該有一個機會和大家說一說的必要。</p>
<p>二·教育播音是一種歐戰以後產生的教育的新工具，他的意義，簡言之，就是利用電波傳送關於教育的智識，這種教育新工具，可以說是從印刷術發明以後傳達智識方法的大革命。因爲靠印刷品傳達智識，不但需時久而生效緩，同時印刷品本身也不輕易爲一般人所能够得到，至於教育播音，無異以播音機爲總講台，以設有收音機的塲所爲聽講席。每一收音機，少則有幾百人可以聽講，多則有幾千甚至幾萬人可以聽講，在現在收音機日趨廉價的時候，以費少許代價購得的收音機，使無數人接受播音機所播送的最新的智識，其對於教育影響之大，自然不難想見。所以說，這種教育播音的新工具是從印刷術發明以後，傳達智識方法的大革命。</p>
<p>歐美諸國利用電波播送教育智識，當以一九二零年英國馬節尼公司劍佛電台ChelmefordStation　Of　Marchoni　Company爲　矢。其後各國繼起倣效，日益發達，而計劃也日趨於系統化，組織化，到了現在，所謂播音教育，已經變成各國最重要的教育的新工具了。至於我國的播音電台，在過去當然也不乏關於教育播音的節目，但是和歐美各國相較，其利用的程度，自然相差還很遠。</p>
<p>三·本部這一次實施教育播音，一方面因爲鑒於民衆智識的幼稚，認爲應該有利用這種新工具，給他們以充分的新智識的必要，他方面，因爲國內廣播無綫電台之過去，因爲限於其他節目之設計，對於教育方面的智識，尙未能有系統的播送；所以在今年五月間，就和中央黨部方面，討論到如何利用中央廣播大電台，去進一步的推行這種教育新工具，這就是本部此次實施教育播音的開始。</p>
<p>本部在今年五月間，决定先着手對於全國中等學校學生及民衆的教育播音。因之就製頒全國中等學校及民衆教育館裝設無綫電收音機辦法大綱，令限未裝設收音機的中等學校及民衆教育館，自二十四年度起，分三學期裝竣，由各該主管教育行政權關分期規劃呈報本部，一面由本部向建設委員會預定收音機一千架，計分交流機，蓄電池機乾電池機一種，基於各省市教宵廳局預定分期規劃，分批發交裝設。以上分期裝設的預定表，各省市教育廳局大致巳經呈報到部，間有少數未報或報而不全的地方，經本部催促以後，最短期間內，當能呈報完全的。</p>
<p>其次要說的是本部訓練收音指導員的經過，本部因鑑於各省市中等學校和民衆教育館收音機技術人員的缺乏，認爲有特開專班從事訓練的必要，因之在本年七月二十日至八月二十日一個月中間，舉辦了一次全國中等學校及民衆教育館收音指導昌訓練班，學員是由教育廳局就本機關人員中選送的。這次的訓練班。雖然爲期只有一個月，但是因爲注重於收音機的實習，同時教師都是中央廣播無綫雷臺極有實際經驗的技術人員，所以畢業的學員，對於收音機的裝置修理和收音方法等等，都能够了解運用。現在他們都已畢業返原派遺機關服務了，他們的任務，在於巡迥指導各中等學校和民衆教育館關於收音機的裝置修理和收音方法，對於教育播音的推行，是負有重大的任務的。</p>
<p>第三點要說的是本部延聘教育播昔人員的辦法。本部因鑑於教育播音的重要，所以　聘的講師，俱係對於所任講題極有學騐的專家或政府機關的主管人員，同時因爲使教材系統化起見，對於如何使中等學校學生及一般民衆得到最新聞又適於需要的智識的問題，也是事前經過縝密的討論，爲使大家明瞭講題的內容起見，將每學期播音各項目及次數，列表如下：</p>
<p>以上關於中等學校學生及一般民衆所講的項目，係逐日播送的，每週二，四，六，下午四時三十分至五時，對於中等學生講，一，三，五，及星期日下午六時三十分至七時對一般民衆講。至於各項目詳細的題目，事前也已計劃擬定，並已將節目一覧分發於全國所有的中等學校及民衆敎育館，在此可以毋須詳述。</p>
<p>最後還有一點，就是本部實施播音教育，目的在使中等學校學生及一般民衆得到實際的補充智識，所以對於如何利用播音教育的問題，也已經製定了詳細的辦法，使各中等學校及民衆教育館得有所依據。道些辦法，現在已經頒佈的，有中等學校利用播音教育須知，及民衆敎育館利用播音敎育須知二種。其中關於中等學校省，學校當局，事前必須使學生明瞭每次播音的時間，講題，講師等，每次播音之時，必須召集所有學生聽講筆記，講畢以後，必須由教師加以扼要的說明，考試的時候，並須揷入與播音內容有關的題目，同時教育行政機關視察各校之時，對於播音教育的利用，也應作爲嚴格的考核工作之一。關於民衆教育館者，館長必須速絡當地熱心教育人士，共負使民衆利用教育播昔的責任，務使民衆能够按時來聽，聽講以後，能够摘要如以講解，並張貼適當塲所，使民衆獲得教育播音的實惠。</p>
<p>以上是本部實施教育播音的意義和經過的大概，因爲教育播音開始舉行不久，恐怕大家還不能十分明瞭過去的經過和實施的意義，所以今天特別利用這時問作一概括的報告。希望全國教育行政當局，學校及民衆教育館及其他社會教育機關，都起來注意這僩問題，共負推行的責任。（完）</p>

<p>國營招商局新海輪海元號、昨得電報、在廣東擱淺、正在駁儎拖救中、亟將詳情查誌如下、</p>
<p>擱淺原因</p>
<p>招商局海元輸、爲借用庚欵新建四海輪之第一艘、船價爲一百四十萬元、該輪行駛滬汕港粵綫、係招商局南華班之正式客輪、往來行駛、有一定期間、不稍延誤、今回自滬赴粵、先至汕港兩埠、卸去貨客、再往廣州、本月十七晨五時、該輪航至廣東黃埔地名Taishik　Borreer地方、其時港面發生重霧、海元輪擬往白鵝潭、詎爲霧阻、誤行航道、致擱淺灘、船體陷入淺沙泥中、</p>
<p>脫險有待</p>
<p>海元擱淺後、船主强漢納森、先開足馬力、擬向港中設法自行脫險、無如船儎尙重、船身之吃水頗深、又値潮水低落、實難為力、船主不得已始發電來滬報吿、時滴星期日、停止辦事、故昨晨始電令粵局拖救、期早脫險、</p>
<p>駁儎拖曳</p>
<p>探悉昨日總局急電廣東分局、大致命粵分局迅派駁船、趕往擱淺地Taishik　Borreer、先將海元船內之乘客、設法駁出送到白鵝潭上陸、以免乘客焦急、再令將船內貨物之笨重者駁去一部、以期减輕儎脚、於漲潮時浮出港面、然後施行拖救至粵、據局內負責人員言、海元擱淺處、已近廣東白鵝潭、一經將貨駁出、大約可望拖出也、惟總局扣至昨晚、尙未得出淺消息、故於保險公司方面、已去函通知矣、查該輪原定二十一日進口到滬、今既遭擱、能否如期趕到、尙難預卜云、</p>

<p>財政部昨訓令上海銀錢兩業同業公會云、自法幣施行以後、所有各發行銀行發行部份準備現金、以及各銀錢業營業部份現金、均經由部通令、一體封存在案、茲爲活潑市面起見、除發行部份現金、應全數交由中中交三行接收外、其營業部份已封存之現金、及兌換法幣收入之現金、均准由各該行莊、按照原有領券辦法、以現金六成加配政府債券四成、向中央中國交通二銀行換取法幣、或照章領用法幣、其領用法幣者、仍應訂立領券合同、以資遵守、除函知中央銀行外、合行令仰知照、並轉行各同業一體知照、此令、</p>

<p>滬上絲廠、因外銷激增、原料吿缺、將全部停工、同業公會方面歸咎于浙江省統制蠶絲之影饗、華東社記者、爲此特向浙江省生絲推銷委員會上海辦事處探問、經該處負責人員發表詳情如次、</p>
<p>本年收繭十九萬担</p>
<p>本年春秋二季、據蠶絲改良會調查報吿、江浙收繭量、共計乾繭合司馬秤十八萬一千担、加新繭前存貨一萬七千担、總計十九萬八千担、可成生絲四萬五千担、</p>
<p>生絲出口一千餘萬</p>
<p>自六月起至十月底五個月中、據商品檢騐局報吿、白廠經出口共計二二·九〇三担平均每個月四千六百担左右、本年內共出口生絲價值約一千八百四十餘萬、絲廠業獲利四百餘元、</p>
<p>目下存繭十一萬担</p>
<p>十月底江浙存繭、據蠶絲改良會調查報告、共存乾繭十一萬二千二百六十九担、可成生絲二四·九〇〇祖、照前五個月出口量、可維持至明年三月底止、至今夏開工以來、江浙兩省絲廠八十七家、絲車二萬三千一百九十七部、共繅去乾繭祇七萬六千祖、</p>
<p>政府工作適可而止</p>
<p>查本年絲價上漲、開工廠家加多、致原料不能接新、若絲價反道而行、則原料卽有餘剩、與浙省統制可云完全無關、至於浙省建廳收繭、起于二十三年秋、當時因絲繭無人顧問、而又值亢旱爲災、政府爲維持農民生活、故出而收買、至於本年建廳收買者、僅全省百分之二十、而所收之繭、均由江浙二省及上海市設備及工作較優之絲廠承繅、初未有省界之分、若絲市繼續能維持現價、明年農民廠商均可安居樂業、政府工作、可限於增加蠶種之製造、指導農民之育蠶、增進繅絲之技術、劃一生絲之推銷足矣、至於推銷處本年工作、用一律牌號、推銷歐美、自開辦以來售價由低轉高、悉隨市面爲轉移、從不過事抬抑、使生絲貿易、得以流通、至於如期解貨、品質頂眞、尤爲餘事、上海出口商、對於統制辦法及推銷工作、均認爲非常滿意、咸謂若華絲推銷、均能劃一而注重信用、則對外貿易、進步自可較速、總之、政府對於統制蠶絲、通盤籌劃、以大局爲前提、深望絲廠業、亦能羣策羣力、通同合作、則絲業前途、當有更光明之發展也、</p>
<p>明春增加蠶種製造</p>
<p>又擴蠶絲改良委員會上海辦事處方面息、全國經濟委員會、已計劃於明年春蠶時、擴大範圍、增加蠶種之製造、目下已有改良種二百萬張、將再增加購買五十萬張、於春蠶育殖時、分發各省應用、茲悉各蠶區農民、對改良種十分信仰、自晚秋蠶登塲後、已分向指導處登記、又各區栽培桑樹事宜、除各省區設模範蠶葉改良塲外、並與中國蠶桑改良委員會合作研究矣、</p>

<h3 id="c154">政制改革的途徑（續） <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>（二十四年十一月於上海）</p>
<p>——謹獻於中國國民黨第五次全國代表大會諸同志和好談政制改革的先生們—</p>
<p>（甲）關於憲法的施行者：</p>
<p>（一）憲法草案，由中國國民黨五全大會通過以後，應用各種方法盡量宣傳，同時明定限期，實成各省市縣普及民衆教育，完成地方自治，以爲實施憲政的準備，其限期得視各地方情形酌定，但至多應以一年爲度。在此期中，中央應嚴加督察，如各地方長官及高級黨部宣傳不力，或籌備不及，自應予以嚴厲的處分。</p>
<p>（二）憲法草案既經通過於五全大會，應即同時明定召集國民大會的時期，使各地方籌備自治的工作有一個最後的目標，同時使國民獲有相當參政的機會。其時期也極　應在民國二十六年度內召集。</p>
<p>（三）國民大會通過憲法，正式頒布以後，當然爲實施憲政時期，但憲法中的條文，爲顧到某種地方的環境，某種事實的限制，也仍可以分別規定發生效力的時間，不必强令全部條文同時全國施行。</p>
<p>（乙）關於憲法的內容者：</p>
<p>（一）憲法的名稱則一，而各國憲法的內容則不相同。元首制，內閣制，委員制，共和國，君主國，可是都可以有憲法的。英國式的不成文憲文，美國式的成文憲文，採取議會政治的多黨更迭制固然是一例；蘇俄，意大利，德意志的憲法，採取强化行政權力的一黨專政制也是一例。所以我們應該打破那些「談到憲法就脫不了議會政治的錯誤觀念，自己來斟酌國情，作一個根本上的决定。我以爲我國的憲法應該明文確定「中華民國爲三民主義共和國」，同時在精神上應該確認「中國國民黨爲建設三民主義的中華民國的惟一政黨」惟有如此，主權所屬的國民，一方面可以享有參政權，一方面是不許有違反三民主義的政黨組織，然後可以保障三民生義共和國的存在，故對於中華民國公民的資格，應有消極方面的限制。</p>
<p>（二）憲法應根據總理五權憲法的遺教，「權「能」區分的精義，把選舉，罷免，創制，複决四種「政權」，和行政，立法，司法，考試，監察五種「治權，明白劃分開來，「治權」全交政府，「政權」操於國民（在過渡時期，由國民黨領導國民行使。）以國民大會爲行使「政權」的機關，以中央政府（包含總統及五院）爲行使「治權」的機關。故立法院應被確認爲治權之下的一個組織，絕非與其他議會政治的國家裏的國會相等。換言之，憲法中應明白認定立法院不是用以對抗總統或行政院的監督機關，祇有國民大會纔有這個資格。（未完）</p>

<p>— （巴玲）</p>
<p>吃一行，怨一行：這是一般職業靑年的通病，但是，靑年們，我們須得想想；現在社上上失業的人，是如此這般的多，大學畢業生，找不到職業的，也是很多；我們能有一瞰飯之處，在失業者看來，已是天之騙子了；我們還怨恨什麼呢？照我看來，我們還是盡力找求職業上的興趣，而打倒這怨恨職業的劣根性吧；須知「江南望見江北好，」是人之常情，同時，也是我們人類的大敵！</p>
<p>曾文正公說：「凡人能退一步想，便能心安理得，」這句話，我覺得很有意思，我願一般怨恨現實職業的靑年們，大家念茲在茲，把曾文正公的話，細細的體味一番，我相信：一定能得到無限的好處，而增加自己對於職業生活的趣味。</p>

<p>人事之嬗遞蛻變，皆循進化之軌跡。今之視昔，寗不啞然；而後之視今，亦猶是也。浙東之辦學校，在光緒中葉，紹興之鑑湖，寧波之儲材，胥開全國風氣之先。吾邑，小縣也；學校之設亦甚早，姑勿論當時之課程，而全邑舉行之運動會，有足述者。</p>
<p>會塲爲××寺殿前之廣塲，各校師生羣集其中，既無開會儀式，亦無演說靜默，而秩序井然，無喧譁者，無田賽，徑賽之名，而有賽跑。賽跑又名競走，復有障碍競走，二人三足競足之分。跳有跳遠，跳高。不曰撑竿跳，而曰撑高跳，有足球而不知網球，籃球，，排球。又有算術競走，跳繩，棒跳下，槓子，柔軟體操，盲啞競走等節目，爲今日所未見者。</p>
<p>尤可笑者，則運動既畢，全體排長蛇之陣，出西門，入東門，人人口唱運動之歌，校旗前導，軍樂繼之，步武整齊，氣象軒昂，路旁觀者如堵，村農駭爲異事。所謂軍樂也者，一鼓，一喇叭，吹打不入耳之調，今日思之，不覺啞然</p>
<p>年光如駛，此幼穉運動會中之小運動員，至今有嶄然露頭角者，田舍翁襄邁無成，全運參觀之餘、，回憶當年，情景宛然，喞年光之不能倒流也！</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>前年，我的姑母家僱傭着一個婢女，（俗名大姐，）姿色也不過平常，但極愛修飾。因為伊本因不耐鄕間貧苦的生活，和老子娘鬧翻了出來的，所以所掙的錢，完全花費在衣服和化裝品上面，一個大錢也不寄回去。</p>
<p>住了半年，掙的錢是感到不够化了？於是偸偸地向一個米店裏的小伙計借錢化。那小伙計，本頗有意於這個婢女，所以倒有求必應。二個月後，這秘密給我姑母知道了，於是便藉故把伊辭歇。可是伊却就和那小伙計，租着屋子，同居着了。</p>
<p>但那小伙計，是月入有限的，怎裏負擔得起這麼一個把錢亂化亂使的老婆呢，所以接着便因手，脚不乾凈，被斥退了。那時恰巧他家有二個舞女同居着。閒着談談，便談出生路來了，那個婢女，便跟着舞女，學了幾天，羅雀掘鼠的置辦了一套衣裝，跟着那二位舞女，進舞塲去。</p>
<p>在最初一二個月中，還不過是做着夫妻二人的吃喝。從第三個月起，是逐漸地紅了，服裝也是三天一換，二天一易的了。他的丈夫，就是那個米店的小伙計，從去年年底起，雖然還是躱在家裏，守門煮飯，但出門時，也穿起西裝來了。咭咯咭咯的，倒挺神氣。有時有小孩子跟在他背後，叫做「拖車」，「烏龜」，他只當沒聽見。</p>
<p>因爲他家就住在我姑母家的後弄，所以我現在還時常見到伊，的確，現在是一位再也摩登不過的女性了。</p>

<p>志前笑道：北海爲什麼這樣子生氣？北海走到他面前，還不免喘了兩口氣，搖了頭道：到現在，我相信宇宙裏什麼事情，全是以物質為轉移，假如我有了政權在手，我首先要解决奴隷制度。這奴隷兩個字，不光是指着實行當奴才了頭的人來說的。還有那名義上不是奴隸，事實上他們是作了奴隸的，那也當加以解放。因爲他們作那無形的奴隸，比作那有形的奴隸，還要痛苦十分。他像游行演說一般，說着話，走進程志前屋子裏去，把書包重重的向桌上一放，打着很是響。接着他又用手在桌子上一拍，拍得很重很重。頭一偏道：哼！豈有此理！志前坐在一邊椅子上，右手指尖，微微模着臉腮，只是看了他微笑。直等他不作聲了，才問道：北海，你說誰豈有此理？是我得　了你嗎？北海這才醒悟過來，不由一笑了，因道：我怎麼敢說程先生的　。不過我說的是小西天裏面的高等旅客，程先生呢，總也是高等旅客之一，這一點，或者是我對不住程先生之處。他說着這話時，誰然，還帶了許多苦　，然而他的臉皮，依然還是紅紅的。志前見他是由前面來，而小西天的旅客，讓他不能滿意的，那程度由不能超過於賈多才，這就很可以知道他是什麼意思了。便笑道：我知道了，又有什麼新鮮消息嗎？北海站在屋子中間，把剛才的　，連比帶做，一齊說了出來。自然，那形容之問，是比實在情形，還要過分一些的。（三六三）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后這幾句話的深意，個初倒不會如何感動我，直到現在，我也在人生的過程中經歷了這麼許久的歲月之後，才知道伊的思想是的確很有至理的。</p>
<p>等不到中午時光，伊就急急的發出了一條很奇特而實際上無甚意義的命令；伊吩咐李蓮英親自去監督着那些充花匠的太監，把那一支突然開放的玉蘭花斫下來，碎成片片，埋入泥中去；伊並且還嚴令他們必須去埋在一處最僻靜的所在，不使什麼人可以踏到它，更不使它能受到半些陽光或雨露，免得它再復活過</p>
<p>這一件伊認爲最緊要的事情辦好之後，伊的臉色比較的好看一些了。接着伊又向我說道：</p>
<p>「一個負着過於重大底責任的人，最好是能够隨時忘掉他的責任，否則他的責任必將格外覺得重大了，甚至會使他嚇軟下去。現在決讓我門來來忘掉我們的責任吧！你不是說你能够唱那李太白的「淸平調」嗎？很好，你就給我唱一回吧</p>
<p>其時伊的憂慮雖然是已像寬解了許多，但臉上仍無一絲笑容，祇教李蓮英趕快出去召兩個樂工來，一個吹笛的，一個吹簫的，帶着他們的樂器進宮來侍候。這兩個人的技術很不錯，合奏得非常動聽，我也勉强裝着笑容，提高了嗓子，唱那李白的淸平調；當我在唱的時候，我晴暗偸看太后，但見伊臉上的許多皺紋已漸漸地鬆開了，兩個眸子裏也閃出了一種比較有活力的光芒，伊所需要的安慰居然是得到了。我希望伊從此就可以安靜下去了。</p>

<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>走俗抗塵，頗思得一淸境，以滌煩襟，適眞如黃氏畜植塲主人黃君岳淵，及名書家謝閒鷗兄來柬見邀，遂欣然命駕，予抵園絕早，客尙未集，主人爲談今年菊花不及曩歲之盛，且連日風雨，凌虐殊茶，花已垂垂而瘁脫再遲半月者，無復有寒花晚節可賞矣。且謂近晤某君，與之商榷藝菊法，頗多經驗之談，如云：「春宜爽，夏宜潤，秋宜濕，冬宜燥，春夏宜瘠，固其質而養其氣；秋冬宜肥，促其花而培其本。至於陰陽調節，尤費周章。偏重於陽，利於花葉，不利於根莖。偏重於陰，利於根莖，不利於花葉，觀此可證始則宜陰，終則宜陽，庶其有濟。「藝菊之秘，盡洩於此矣。客絡繹來，遂由黃公子導遊一周。菊萃於玻璃花房之側，十丈珠簾，細蕊披拂，下墜可咫尺。雪靑荷花，蒨豔似妙女，梨香菊一如常花，然手握之，鼻嚊作梨香。相傳爲大內之珍，淸季慈禧后分賜於張勳者，張之園丁，遂私鬻其種與人，於是普遍於大江南北。此小小掌故，殊有足述者也。既而主人宴客於竹屋中，傾葡萄之釀，啖栗子之雞，厥味津津，爲之醉飽，辭謝出園，與黃寄萍胡伯洲姚吉光丁君匋諸子，參觀加拿大種植塲。畦徑悉圍覆於玻璃屋中，計十有餘所，通以暖氣管，入之，和煦如春。所栽以番茄爲最充饒，藤葉上縈，結實殷紅有若霜秭，甚爲可喜，年得兩熟，食戶仰給焉。花菜生於北地，耐寒不畏霜雪，亦位置得當，以適其性。且設吸水機，以引窪地之水，雖旱魃不足爲患。如此經營，在國內尙屬創見，予固樂而附及之。深願加意擴充，則舉凡一切果蔬花木，俱沐科學之化澤？將來收效之宏，當十百倍於今日，可操左券也。</p>

<p>— 陳小蝶</p>
<p>僕以爲遊黃山，取經宜從苦竹溪而入，從湯口而出，尋勝探幽，事爲輕便。其勝有五：自苦竹溪至獅子林，皆爲坦途，可以籃輿直上，較湯口至文殊爲使一也。自苦竹溪上觀九龍瀑其勝順，自雲谷而下觀九龍瀑其勢逆二也。獅子林佳處在始信峯，散花塢，西海門，然遊始信峯，必須登石筍矼，遊散花塢，必須到散花菴，遊西海門，必須到松林岡頂，觀日出必須到光明頂，非有充分足力，不能濟勝，自苦竹溪來，至獅子林，一路坦送，未經跋涉，勇氣甚旺，凡茲幽險，皆可盡之。若自文殊來，足力已疲，不能對付。予問之惟淸儈，知游獅子林者，登始信僅到琴台，游西海門者，竟不知有松林岡，而散花塢游者，則在予之前，僅三人云。此凡限於時日者半，然限於足九者亦半，故自苦竹溪上，自爲較便，三也。湯池之浴，天下無雙，自湯口來者，必以先浴爲快，然一浴之後，即忽忽入山，跋涉既終，遊興已盡欲冉浴仙池，有不可得。自苦竹溪來，則以湯也之浴，爲其游山最後之酬庸，使其灌頂醍醐之際，迥想雲山，有顯然登仙之樂。且游山之願已了，若愛此仙漿，竟不妨隨日盤桓，竟解衣之樂，四也。黃山精華，在半山等至獅子林一帶，出雲谷不免少遊，自苦竹溪來，步步入勝，逾進　佳，殆至游興既闌，尙有湯池一浴，出乎塵表，實較雲谷而出者，使人興曲終人散，江上峰靑之歎者，爲勝五也。故僕以爲入山孔道，實宜移至太平，當黃山勝境之下，以符舊址，而桃花源裏人家，亦無車馬喧闃之擾。</p>

<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「我想你常愛和哈先生來往，竟把貝先生丢在一邊了」，蜀夫人故意詭譎地說道。</p>
<p>「是的，我確是有的；我恨煞當我可以出去和哈先生在森林寡巡視的時候，我偏要耕田去草。貝先生以爲那種事是無聊的並且說哈先生痴了，因爲他會躺着好幾個鐘頭，凝看河裏的一條魚或樹上的一隻烏。」</p>
<p>「是的，貝先生是一個本色的農夫，他不知道一個博物學者的工作和他自己相比，正是一樣有趣，也許是一樣有用。唐恩，假使你眞愛這些物事，我想你的確愛的，並且我歡喜看見這種情形的，你可以有時間去研究它們，並且還有書籍來帮助你；不過除此以外我還要你再做一樁事，並且要不懈地去做，否則你後來要懊悔，覺得你又要重新起頭來過了」。</p>
<p>「是的，師母」，唐恩和順地說着，然而面色上又顯出不免因蜀夫人最後數語的嚴重性而受驚恐，因爲他和書籍無緣，却又分明决心要去研究她所提起的任何事物。</p>
<p>「你看見那個有十二隻抽屜的橱子嗎」？是接着最想不到的又一個奇問。</p>
<p>唐恩確曾看見過二個高高舊式的櫥，各立在鋼琴的一邊；他很認識它們，並且常看見總，釘，栗殼紙以及相類的有用的物品從各個抽屜裏取出來。他點着頭又微笑着。蜀夫人又繼</p>
<p>「嘸，你想那些抽屜不是你置放鷄蛋，石子介殼和苔衣等的好去處嗎」？</p>
<p>「啊，眞好，可是你也不願見我的東西，像貝先生所說「堆來堆去」的不是嗎」？唐恩喊道，他忽然坐起，兩目發着光，一看那舊傢具。</p>

<p>— 章繼</p>
<p>十三日東京電：「最近日本小日本學生中近視眼者突然增加，全體學生之　　之五六十須帶眼鏡。文部省認爲教育上之重大問題，學校建築設備恊議會，十二日邀請東京帝國大學醫學部長永井博士。工學部教授大山博士。照明學會長商津博士、電影普及會伊藤博士。文部省體育課長岩原等至文部省，報吿日來在文理大學附屬大學校實騐之採光。桌子之位置。形態等，對於學生視力影響之結果。」</p>
<p>近視眼在今日光學昌明的時代，不難利用鏡片來補救，然而這畢竟是身體，上的缺陷。所以與其事後救補，莫若事前防範。日本文部省對於半數以上的小學生患近視眼，認爲教育上的重大問題，進而研究對策，這在健全國民體格一點，自有極重要的意義。因爲國民體格的健全與否，大半從童年時養成，尤其近視眼，都從童年時因不注意視力，積漸養成，所以防範未來國民患近視眼，最有效力的也就是從小學生注意起。</p>
<p>我國國民患近視眼的，沒有精確的統計，但從大體上看來，知識分子大都是近視眼的患者，至於勞動階級，則患者較少。我國近數十年來，學校教育，漸見發達，但對於敎室的光綫，學生坐位的視綫，因事實上的限制，都沒有注意到，這已足影響學生的視力，而方法未善的考試制度下開夜車的現象，尤為不可設想，但這嚴重問題，國人未注意及之。</p>
<p>日本文部省對於近視眼問題，已開始注意了。我以爲我國近視眼問題，比日本近視眼問題還要嚴重，需要適當的對策，也特別迫切，希望負責當局，當仁不讓，趕緊進行改善。</p>

<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>冬天的日子短了。孩子們被關在揪狹的茅屋裏，就是他們最高興的捉迷藏也懶得玩了。他們看見太陽的餘輝從對山凹裏反射到塲地上的時候，立刻抬起一對小眼睛向天空中搜視有沒有歸巢的烏鴉。他們被關了一整天，這時候可以向祖母那裏扯個謊：「我們到橋頭去望爸爸。」像一羣出棚的小鴨似的溜出去了。</p>
<p>天上是灰色的雲塊，烏鴉在樹頭上盤旋，叫聲彷彿深山中的厲鬼一樣，病人會意想到或許馬上有不幸的事情發生。孩子們跑上橋頭，注視着對山裏的落日，互相比較着各人眼光裏看見的太陽的大小——這是他們祖母講過一個中秋月亮的故事，說是假使看月亮和浴盒一般大小時，就是眞命天子。於是孩子們會喊着月亮和牛車輪一樣大小了。在同伴之間，也在小小的智慧中去搜索一個在日常見到的最巨大的東西來誇耀我是皇帝。後來把太陽也比做了月亮，祇要一有比較的機會，大家搶着皇帝做。</p>
<p>太陽已完全沒到山凹裏去了，祗有遠處的雲片上反映着幾道紫色的金光，這幾乎已成了習慣，這時候隣居老伯伯賣糖粥的梆聲有一下沒一下從官道上送來。擔子已倒了頭，把粥爐擔在後面，他的破氈帽抬在額角上，有時候唱着年輕時的私情山歌。看見孩子們在橋頭，遠遠地就喊着：「今天生意好，粥賣光了。明天留一點回來。」笑着在橘的下塘轉了灣，向孩子們招招手。</p>
<p>沒有糖粥吃，孩子們並沒有威到失望。仙們被關了一天，到橋頭來溜一溜，彷彿牽頭牛兒溜個野，看看太陽，做做皇帝，他們已是滿高興的了。而且賣糖粥伯伯回來之後，就可以接到他們的爸爸了。爸爸會做各式各樣的糖馬糖船，到城裏去賣，他擔上有個轉盤，有糖馬糖船的地方，是狹狹的一條線，一枚銅元轉一次，但是那些糖馬糖船每天擔出擔進沒有轉去。爸爸回來祇是做些零</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>碎的糖塊應下一大的市；這些零碎糖塊還是每天有多回來，孩子們就盼望這些。爸爸的擔子挑上橋頭，大家跳上去搶糖塊吃，爸爸雖然喊着：『慢！慢！回家去分。」到家却早已搶個乾凈了。</p>
<p>祖母聽見他們吵鬧，也支着拐杖到門前來探望。「生意好？」對兒子說子，就摸摸這個孩子，那個孩子的頭，微笑着說：「不要吵啊，爸爸累了！」</p>
<p>爸爸把糖擔停到屋裏，從腰圍裏抽出旱烟袋打火吸烟。孩子們就圍着糖担，到一隻布製的袋裏計算爸爸今天賺來的銅元。爸爸靠在竹椅上，對祖母說：「今天大總日，城裏喜事多哩。好運氣，做到不少生意啊！」</p>
<p>孩子們把錢袋交到祖母手裏，圍着爸爸吵鬧也要到城裏去玩。爸爸把最小的弟弟抱在懷裏，依次都圍在爸爸的膝前，爸爸摸一把那個臉袋，聞一個那個的嘴，笑着。祖母忙着到後屋預備後餐，孩子們自然又是一窩蜂似的湧到桌子上，見還是老樣子的幾碟菜登，最大的孩子說：</p>
<p>「爸做了好生意，明天買肉吃吧！」</p>
<p>祖母雖然對他橫了個白眼，爸爸却答應了，說明天帶肉回來。爸爸很快吃了晚飯，生了爐子，預備做零碎糖塊，孩子們就圍着祖母要講故事。這是每天晚上的功課，祖母肚裏已經沒有一個新鮮的故事了，但是孩子們不信祖母的話，有的搶了祖每的拐杖，有的爬上櫈去扯祖母的假髮髻。祖母輕輕地打了他們，幾下，終於又：</p>
<p>從前一家人家：生了個兒子……見月亮有車輪那樣大……後來做了皇帝……就是明太祖……</p>
<p>故事沒有講完，孩子們一個個靠着祖母膝前睡熟了。祖母抱着孩子們到後房去的時候，父親輕輕地說：「媽，你也睡罷，我做完幾板糖就來。」一邊仰起頭來向窗外望去，「今夜的月亮像浴盆那般大哩，可惜孩子都睡熟了……」</p>

<p>田家樂</p>
<p>田家快樂沒嗟吁，數橡茅屋儘我居，春養花蠶供衣服，冬春白米有贏餘。田家快樂正不俗，沉醉高歌自鼓腹。門前鷄犬亂紛紛，地上桑麻花碌碌，雖無拍葉珍珠酒，也有淸醪三五斗。雖無猪羊大葷餚，也有魚蝦堪適口，雖無圓眼與荔枝，也有荸薺　菱藕，雖無異供好蔬菜，也有烏松與嫩菲，雖無歌唱美女娘，也有村姬伴相府，米自春，酒自做，紡棉花，織大布。不顧小小貧，不顧大大富，沒頭船，儘可渡，半自有，不須雇。且吃葷，莫吃素，黃脚鷄，鍋內煤，添些鹽，用些醋，煨芋艿，煎豆腐，沉沉吃到日將暮。竹板床，軟草舖，且留宿到明朝，這般快樂眞千古。</p>

<p>連朝陰雨悶填胸。征人愁悵恨天公。我拿了，一卷開篇沙發坐。細細翻閱已朦朧。忽然是，我身恍在汪洋側。四周峭壁盡高峯。躍入小舟把船家作。不顧風浪向前衝。突來海島當前立。就此是，舍舟登陸趣無窮。因爲是，美麗的小鳥鳴聲樂。峨峨怪石水淙淙。兩旁樹木茂盛極。再有那玲瓏石洞奪天工。進洞愈深並愈狄，行來百步見天空。原來是，絕大平原康莊道。况且是，桃花滿地灼灼紅。極妍盡態如紅雨。搖曳多姿綘霞同。香風撲鼻來花國。神怡心曠樂融融。鷄犬相聞田舍接。行人來往禮謙恭。有幾個，玉立婷婷及筓女。嬋衣輕薄露酥胸。他們的，衣冠不類人間式。來了那，童顏鶴髮一仙翁。說道此地是，桃源仙島淸幽境。孺子到此眞喜相逢。我們是，明來淸初來避亂。遙隔塵寰路不通。同至他家將香茶飲。瓊漿玉露味相同。我問道，邦國顚危如累卵。有何高計挽頹風。仙翁道，弱肉强食從古說。惟有是，各持毅力去作英雄。人力能將天數轉。循環定理有窮通。淸淡片刻時光晚。我與他，相訂後會別忽忽。曲折蜿蜓桃源出。天昏地黑起狂風。衣杉單薄身寒冷。忙覓來舟駛海中。那知道，忽來海獸長且大。血盆巨口對舟衝。心膽俱寒柁漿落。不計生命閉雙瞳。後來是，一無音息張目看。原來獨自坐房中。窗外的雨聲仍未息。案頭香茗尙和融。方知道，海獸吼聲是隣兒突。南柯上夢記游踪。我只望，他日再得問津去。桃源洞裏訪仙翁。前度的劉郎興更濃。</p>

<p>國立中央博物館籌備處自擇定者都中山門內城旁地址，由建築委員會聘中華民國國籍之建築師十三人，參加圖案徵選，並由建委會另組審查委員會，執行審查，早經竣事，當首選者爲本埠興業建築事務所建築師徐敬直氏，當受聘任該院建築師，徐氏以建築圖案中，大部份已確定，尙有若干小建築須修改之處，徐氏最近已由平回滬，與中央博物院建委會工程顧問梁思成氏指導下，從事修改，年內或可動工，茲將其圖案徵選經過，及建築計劃詳錄於後。</p>
<p>圖案徵選經過</p>
<p>建築圖案章程，自本年六月五日發出，聘請名建築師十三人，參加計劃：（一）上海李宗侃（二）上海李錦沛（三）上海徐敬直（四）上海奚福泉（五）上海莊俊（六）廣州陳榮枝（七）上海陸謙受（八）上海童雋（九）天津過元熙（十）上海董大酉（十一）南京虞炳烈（十二）北平楊廷寳（十三）上海蘇夏軒除蘇夏軒外十二競選人均按章於八月二十日送達中央博物院籌備處，依次用天干編號，撥交審委審員五人，一爲建築委員會代表張道藩，二爲中英庚欵董事會代表杭立武，三爲建築師劉敏楨氏，四爲籌備主任李濟，五爲專門委員兼工程顧問梁思成，九月二三兩日，由審委員李濟，梁思成逐圖詳加檢討，其中午時圖案上有「人傑地靈」圖章爲識，與章程抵觸，失去受評資格，其餘十一競賽圖案，多估價超過預算，或面積不符應用，茲據下列各要點逐圖分析：</p>
<p>（一）總地圖之佈置（二）各館平面之佈置（三）館與館間之關係（四）面積之大小（五）將來擴充之可能性（六）各層間上下交通（七）光綫之分配（八）室內之高度（九）結構之繁簡難易（十）全部之立體佈局（十一）各立面布局（十二）建築各部詳細節目（十三）其他</p>
<p>徐敬直獲首獎</p>
<p>其中第一，二，三，五諸條，尤爲審查，用不記名法，一致選出已字圖案爲當選，茲錄審委會原評語如次。「在總平面之局上，作者對於不規則之「菜刀形」地址頗能超出其困難的限制而駕馭之；使狹長而與中山路通之刀把」部分，成爲主要入口，同時對於東西街亦用「轅門」，使成重要門道，顯示作者對於道路輕重，曾經予以思慮。前部園庭醒活，易於吸引觀衆。且不對稱之布局，乃三館之獨立性尤便於分期建築。至於全部建築對於地形高下之顧慮，為其他各圖所無，更為本圖之特點。在各個館上着眼：入門處公共大廳極為合用。大廳兩面引入各館陳列部分，而各館長及院長，又同在此廳四隅，聯絡至便。各館工作部份則在各館長室下之地面層，工作集中，而各館又不相擾；在工作上，其機構頗爲靈活。在平面面積上，惟本圖能與規定符合，且有超過之者。其陳列各廳大多數同在一層之上，可免觀衆上下樓梯，亦爲本圖之特長。</p>
<p>各圖工作部分上下交通方便，各陳列室除一小部分外，大都光綫充足，且　有高低，易於容納大小不同之陳列品　在外表上，三館及院行政部立體的勾鎖聯接，至爲適當，大殿與三館陳列廳與以極明顯之反襯，而能調和。三館各辦公室，陳列廳，及庫房，在外面均能充分表現，無虛矯遮匿之病，皆爲本圖案之特點。其在各部各件之上，尤能表示作者對於中國宮殿建築有深刻之認識，故當選。</p>
<p>作者卽為本埠興業建築事務所建築師徐敬直氏，徐氏為中國近年建築界後起之秀，南京總理陵園內之農事試騐所及最近竣工之上海魚市塲現則中選，得榮任此一百五十萬元浩大工程之中央博物館之建築師，</p>
<p>全院建築計劃</p>

<h3 id="c230">工廠建築之設計（上） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 伯屏</p>
<p>中國在這振興工業的呼號中，雖然是在不景氣，但是有許多工業與國防有重要的關係，所以也就逐漸的建設了，重要的關係，所以也就逐漸的建設了，我們設計一個工工廠，在現在至少要根據中央規定的工廠法來設計，對於工廠本身利益要顧到，對於工人的安全也要顧到，在上海這地方，有許多實業家，資本家？他們的工廠內部設計，是馬馬虎虎，以致鬧成絕大的災難，一個鍋爐的破裂，就是千百人的生命，這是多麼一個嚴重的問題呵，安全的工廠設計，是根據下列三原則而定的：</p>
<p>（一）建築堅固！如果建築不堅固，機器振動的結果，以至牆身傾斜。</p>
<p>（二）光綫充足，、光綫不充足，影響生產甚大，並且對於工人的健康、，也有絕大的影響。</p>
<p>（三）取材適宜—建築林料的選擇，是工廠設計中最要考慮的部分，如鋼骨混凝十是工廠最好的建築，木質的建築，不適宜於易於爆發的工廠。</p>
<p>（一）地點之選擇</p>
<p>地點之選擇爲設計上首先解决之問題，在學理上是以供給（Supply）製造（Manufacturing）與乎需要而定的，供給就是原料的問題，工廠應在原料出產地的附近，這是一個一定不移的公理，因爲距原料生產地太遠了，就要花一筆運輸費，成本上就增加了許多，這是不合經濟原則的，其他要注意的，就是原動力的問題，所謂原動力，就是煤，水和汽油，我們知道，無論那一個工廠都需要這三種東西，有時候我們預定的地方，有原料，有煤，但是水量不足或者水的成份不合需要，那麼我們也只得改變原來的計劃了，其次與地點選擇有關係的，就是製造，我們知道製造是利用機械，但是人工也是一樣的重要，我們要多量的人工，必需在城市，我們要低下的工資，必須在鄉下，這次要看情形而定，從長考慮，並沒有一定的原則的，需要就是販賣，消耗的成分，以城市爲最多，有些東西，鄉村反比城市更需要得急切，更需要得多，所以我們的工廠的地點的選擇，就是根據上列三原則。</p>
<p>（二）建築種類</p>
<p>工廠式的建築，在學理方面講來，有下列四種，各有各的畏處，各有各的短處，沒有一定的準則，要看工廠的性質而定，譬如以下列而論：</p>

<p>The Original Text of the Party Member Code Proposal</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth Plenary Session passed the Chinese Kuomintang Party Member Code proposal at the third general assembly on the morning of the 18th. The original text is as follows: The Premier established the great ambition of inheriting the past and ushering in the future, saving the country and the people, creating the grand plan of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, and leading the National Revolution to revive China and build the Republic. Today, all compatriots throughout the country are able to be of one mind and one heart and follow the Premier's teachings. This is the manifestation of the Premier's great wisdom, great benevolence, and great courage, and also the inspiration of the great Dao and great virtue of serving the world for the common good followed by the ancestors of China. Now that the foundation of the revolution has been firmly established and the revolutionary doctrines are widely practiced, the internal and external troubles are increasing simultaneously with the progress of the revolution. All our comrades should know that the responsibilities our Party bears to the ancestors of hundreds of millions of generations, to the descendants of hundreds of millions of generations, and to the national people and the human beings of the world are hundreds and thousands of times greater than in the past. Our Premier deeply knows that the country is the accumulation of people, and people are the tools of the heart. The governance and chaos of the country depend on the prosperity and filth of society, and the prosperity and filth of society depend on the vigor and languor of people's hearts. He also knows that the consistent Dao of the ancient sages of sincerity, rectification, cultivation, ordering the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world, and the unique supreme virtue of self-cultivation as the foundation, are the supreme essentials for saving the country and the people and relieving all of humanity. Therefore, he repeatedly and earnestly exhorted in his teachings. This assembly is awed by the greatness and profundity of the teachings and the severity of the national crisis, and further aware of the ongoing and unfinished disasters of the human beings of the world. We firmly believe that self-reliance is the basis for establishing people, and self-help is the beginning of helping others. Therefore, we have specially formulated twelve articles of the Party Member Code for the entire Party, and order all comrades to abide by them uniformly, striving for fathers to teach their sons, teachers to teach their younger brothers, superiors to teach their subordinates, and generals to teach their soldiers, to believe and practice together, to lament together, to be loving and sincere, and to be without interruption from beginning to end. Everyone can become a person who stands tall between heaven and earth in the world, so that the Republic of China can become a prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy country in the world. Then the Three Principles of the People will be implemented throughout the country and promoted to the world, and for thousands of years, it will forever leave boundless prosperity. Only our Party comrades, who bear the heavy responsibility of revolution and nation-building, shall abide by it together.</p>
<p>The Chinese Kuomintang Party Member Code: (1) Loyalty and courage are the foundation of patriotism; (2) Filial piety and obedience are the foundation of ordering the family; (3) Benevolence and love are the foundation of dealing with people; (4) Righteousness and trustworthiness are the foundation of establishing a career; (5) Peace is the foundation of conducting oneself in the world; (6) Etiquette is the foundation of managing affairs; (7) Obedience is the foundation of responsibility; (8) Diligence and thrift are the foundation of service; (9) Neatness and cleanliness are the foundation of strengthening the body; (10) Helping others is the foundation of happiness; (11) Knowledge is the foundation of aiding the world; (12) Perseverance is the foundation of success.

<p>The Plenary Session Held a Memorial Week Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth Plenary Session held a memorial week at 8:00 AM on the 18th in the assembly hall. All committee members, representatives, and staff of the General Assembly Secretariat participated. Chairman Zou Lu reported, and the ceremony ended at 8:40 AM. Then the third general assembly was held. Zou's original speech is as follows: Holding a memorial week during the Fifth National Congress, with comrades from home and abroad gathered together, fills me with feelings of both joy and fear. Since the Premier's passing, many of our Party comrades have had differences of opinion, leading to division within the Party, and the country and the people have suffered. This is an undeniable fact. Now, amidst complex personnel matters and divergent political views, with the slogan of overcoming national difficulties together, regardless of North or South, far or near, they are rushing to the assembly, striving to be the first and fearing to be the last. Moreover, continuous contact with comrades from all sides and the phenomena seen in the assembly hall all show that private opinions have been eliminated, and we are working together to plan national affairs. This spirit of sincere unity, knowing only the Party and the country, is not only the fortune of our Party but also the fortune of the nation and the people. This is the most gratifying thing. Because of this extreme joy, I am deeply worried. In the past few days, I have been unable to stop worrying, which makes me feel fearful. Because comrades from all sides, from all four directions, and from home and abroad have come together, it is neither for power nor for position, but entirely for overcoming national difficulties together and seeking sincere unity. However, this sincere unity must have measures for overcoming national difficulties together to enable comrades from all sides to work together to achieve it, and for the entire Party to unite to lead the entire country to overcome this serious difficulty and achieve the Premier's goal of saving the country with the Three Principles of the People. If there is only the slogan of sincere unity to overcome national difficulties together, but no measures for sincere unity to overcome national difficulties, I fear that these comrades, regardless of North or South, far or near, who came with great enthusiasm, will leave with dejection after a few days. If the central government does not have effective measures to save the country, comrades from all sides cannot but base their actions on their sincere responsibility to seek ways to save the country. Not only will opinions become more divergent, but I fear that people will continue to deceive, scare, and tear down. The Party will be in a dire state, and the country will be even worse. At this time, if we want to gather comrades with the slogan of sincere unity to overcome national difficulties, I fear that it will be difficult to have successors, learning from the mistakes of the past. Moreover, this meeting has been able to bring together comrades with extremely different political views, which should attract people's attention. Even with measures to respond, I am afraid that it may not be possible to alleviate this national crisis immediately. If there are no measures, it will only increase people's contempt and hasten the disaster of destruction. To go a step further, if there are measures to achieve the spirit of sincere unity, then we will unite to save the country; otherwise, people will induce each other in many ways, and there will be those who follow along. This is something that I cannot help but say with tears. Since our Party has been in power, the losses to the country up to today have not been small. This is something that all of us in the Party should take responsibility for, and not blame only a certain part of the comrades. Now that comrades from all sides are coming together, it is to work together to reverse this dangerous situation. In terms of the country, it is called washing away shame; in terms of the individual, it is called making up for mistakes. This is truly the most important opportunity and responsibility for us to the country and the people. Therefore, I deeply hope that all comrades will not let it go lightly. This is what I earnestly hope for from all the comrades present, and especially for the comrades in charge. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Results of the British General Election Announced <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The results of the British general election have been announced. The number of seats won by each party is not outside the expectations of the general public. The National Government holds approximately two hundred and fifty more seats in the House of Commons. Observers say that such an advantage has only been seen since the Great Reform Act of 1831. More than seventy percent of the electorate exercised their right to vote, which is clear evidence of the British people's special concern for national affairs during this tumultuous time in the world. Prime Minister Baldwin, on the evening when the election situation was determined, announced to his countrymen his two great aspirations: to work diligently for national revival and world peace. Party leaders Attlee and Morrison have also expressed their disappointment with the election results. Thus, in the next five years, the guiding spirit of British domestic and foreign policy will continue to be Neo-Conservatism.</p>
<p>This election, on the surface, was a struggle between maintaining the National Government and restoring a party cabinet, but in reality, it was merely a struggle between the two major forces of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. Baldwin, with his personal prestige, took advantage of the international situation and suddenly announced an early re-election. One purpose was to use diplomacy to consolidate political power, and the other was to enhance the power to curb the East African war through the renewed support of the people. The close interaction between domestic and foreign policy is the principle of modern politics.</p>
<p>However, as far as the Labour Party is concerned, it has already fallen into a difficult situation in this session. Its leaders in the House of Commons, Lansbury, and in the House of Lords, Clifford, resigned due to their opposition to sanctions. The internal divisions within the Labour Party have not yet been repaired. It is quite difficult to find a person in the party to serve as Prime Minister. This is a major weakness in the Labour Party's strategy. Moreover, the economic situation in Britain today is the wealthiest in Europe, and the difference compared to the poverty of 1931 cannot be measured. The Labour Party's failure to gain momentum this time is also due to the circumstances.</p>
<p>However, in this general election, the Labour Party knew early on that it was powerless to seize power. However, there was still something to compete for, namely, the issue of the principle of "correction and balance" in the democratic system, given that the ruling party maintained its overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. This provided an excuse for the opposition party to appeal to the hearts of the British people who love democracy. Therefore, during the election campaign, Lloyd George once said, "If we see an inflated majority again, the danger will be extreme." Snowden also said, "If the election results give the government an uncontrollable majority, it will not only be a great disaster for the country, but also a disaster for the world." Looking at the election results now, the Conservative Party has dropped from 471 seats to 383 seats, and the Labour Party has also increased from 52 seats to 154 seats. It can be seen that the opposition party cannot be said to have been an absolute failure.</p>
<p>Overall, if we look at the overall situation, in terms of region, large cities and rural areas are mostly the domain of the Conservative Party, and most industrial areas belong to the Labour Party. However, there are also those who lean towards the Conservative Party because the protectionist tariffs and the expansion of military demand are beneficial to domestic industry and commerce. The Labour Party failed to "recover lost ground" in Wales, Scotland, and the northern industrial areas in this session, which is a great disappointment. Furthermore, in terms of personnel, MacDonald's defeat is the same fate as Lloyd George's in 1931. It can be said that another political giant has "ended." The leader of the Anti-Government Liberal Party, Samuel, completely failed in this session. Although Simon, the leader of the Liberal Party affiliated with the government, was still elected, the number of votes he received plummeted. From this, it can be seen that liberalism is increasingly declining in Britain. On the other hand, Morrison, who is known as the "strength of the Labour Party," was defeated in 1931 and has now re-entered Parliament. This can be seen as a sign of the Labour Party's resurgence, and it is becoming increasingly clear that the British political stage will maintain a two-party system. As for the reorganization of the cabinet, it is an inevitable trend. It is rumored that the ardent navalist Winston Churchill is slated to succeed as First Lord of the Admiralty, and Eden, who has recently emerged in the international diplomatic arena, will be transferred to Minister of War or Colonial Secretary. Thus, strengthening national defense and uniting the colonies will be the basic tone of British politics in the future.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The midnight bell in Geneva rang loudly, signifying the beginning of the world's most peculiar economic war. Participating in this war on one side are the 52 member states of the League of Nations Sanctions Committee, and on the other side is Italy. This implementation of sanctions by the League of Nations member states is an unprecedented historical event in using collective economic and financial pressure to stop the carnage of war. The tolling of the bells signifies the concerted efforts of the entire world to implement this plan. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Various countries' sanctions against Italy have been implemented starting today. Italian people generally regard this day as "the most inglorious and unfair date in world history." National flags are hung throughout the country, and people are holding demonstrations everywhere. In the capital, flags are hung in the windows of all residences and shops. Students are parading in groups, singing patriotic songs to express their resistance to the sanctions. Troops are stationed in front of the embassies of the countries participating in the sanctions, especially the British and French embassies, to prevent incidents. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Two million students across the country held a grand demonstration today to protest the League of Nations' economic sanctions. Flags were displayed in every household, and shops were closed all day to show the spirit of national unity in Italy. In Rome, 20,000 students marched in front of the embassies of the countries participating in the sanctions, with especially blatant demonstrations in front of the British embassy. The various marching groups are scheduled to gather in front of the Palazzo Venezia at 10:00 p.m., at which time Mussolini will be presiding over the Supreme Council to determine major plans. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The member states of the League of Nations are scheduled to implement sanctions against Italy starting tomorrow. In a few hours, Italy will be almost cut off from the rest of the world economically. According to the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly, (1) member states must not transport weapons, ammunition, or military supplies to Italy, while Abyssinia, as a country recognized as having been invaded, may still purchase armaments to the best of its ability. All member states will comply with this measure. Only Switzerland, following the example of the United States, has simultaneously banned the shipment of armaments to both belligerent countries, Italy and Abyssinia. (2) Financial sanctions will also be implemented simultaneously. Fifty-two member states have pledged not to provide loans to the Italian government, corporations, or individuals in any form, except for charitable causes such as the Red Cross. These countries will not adopt a barter system with Italy. (3) All member states participating in the sanctions will prohibit the import of Italian goods in order to prevent Italy from finding foreign currency. (4) Participating countries will prohibit the export to Italy of many items necessary for war, such as trucks and various types of gases, starting tomorrow morning. As for coal, oil, and iron, they are not subject to the embargo because non-member countries such as the United States and Germany can continue to sell them to Italy. Of the 58 member states of the League of Nations, excluding the two parties involved, Italy and Abyssinia, 52 have accepted the above measures. However, Austria, Hungary, Albania, and Paraguay have refused to comply. As for the non-member United States, it has simultaneously banned the shipment of armaments to both parties involved, and Egypt has replied to the League of Nations that it will participate in the sanctions. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy's measures to resist sanctions will be implemented after midnight today. The government has strictly ordered customs authorities at all seaports and borders to comply. All goods from countries participating in the sanctions, even those already in transit, will not be allowed to enter Italy. However, in theory, these measures to resist sanctions do not completely block all foreign products. Raw materials and food may still be allowed to enter Italy with special permission from the authorities. Recently, various raw materials and food have been stockpiled in large quantities, enough to last for some time. Also, for certain secondary products produced by foreign countries, they may still enter the country only if the exporting country accepts Italian goods. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Since the League of Nations member states implemented sanctions against Italy, the living conditions in Italy have changed drastically. For example, to save electricity, businesses close at 4:30 p.m. The lunch break for employees has been reduced from two hours to half an hour. Public buses are running less frequently due to a shortage of gasoline. Most employees walk to their offices. Most homeowners do not use heating appliances to save coal. Stores have stopped selling foreign foods. The authorities are urging people to buy "domestic products." Many shopkeepers have been accused of raising prices to hoard goods.

<p>From the Tigray Province Front, regarding the government's appointment of Chief of the General Staff General Badoglio as High Commissioner of East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Forces, military figures here explain that Italy will now focus all its efforts on the Abyssinian issue. Various European events, such as the Brenner Pass incident (the border between Italy and Austria) and others, have been relegated to secondary importance. General Badoglio is Italy's foremost general, and his appointment as Commander-in-Chief is tantamount to devoting the nation's full strength to managing East Africa. From now on, the Abyssinian campaign will become a real war, not just a colonial conquest. (17th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Hu Shize, director of the Chinese delegation office at the League of Nations, recently sent a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating that the Chinese government is currently studying methods to implement the resolutions passed by the Sanctions Adjustment Committee. Once the implementation date is determined, the Secretariat will be notified. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the response from our government to the recommendations adopted by the League of Nations Adjustment Committee on sanctions against Italy, Article 3 prohibiting the import of Italian goods, Article 4 prohibiting the export of important raw materials to Italy and its territories, and Article 5 regarding mutual assistance measures, our country's permanent representative to the League of Nations delivered the response to the League of Nations Secretariat on the 29th of last month. The contents are as follows: The Chinese government accepts the recommendations adopted by the Adjustment Committee in Articles 3, 4, and 5 and is currently studying methods to implement them. To the extent possible, the government will implement the recommendations in Articles 3 and 4 on the date designated by the committee but must be notified in a timely manner so that these measures can be implemented on a mutually agreed date.

<p>(Paris) The Paris Echo's correspondent in London interviewed various important British figures, including Foreign Secretary Hoare, regarding the sanctions against Italy, which went into effect today. The results of the interviews proved that British public opinion strongly supports the League of Nations' implementation of sanctions. However, the general British public does not believe that the Italian-Abyssinian conflict can be resolved through various extreme methods, such as blockades and military sanctions. But they all hope that the League of Nations can pass a test. The British people are very angry about Italy's aggression. Therefore, even if the British government does not support participating in collective action, it has no choice but to do so due to public opinion. Another important figure said, "The British people are very angry at any provocation...</p>

<p>(London) Due to the sanctions against Italy to be implemented today, the British government has notified Germany, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, and Albania that all goods shipped to Britain from today onwards must be accompanied by a certificate of origin. The purpose is to prevent Italian goods from entering Britain by detour. Germany refused to comply. However, while the British authorities continued to discuss the matter with the German government, they ordered customs to require certificates for all German goods entering the country. It is reported that the British government does not believe that Germany's claim that this measure violates the Anglo-German commercial treaty is valid. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's announcement that the United States Navy and Army will no longer protect American merchants trading with the belligerent countries of Italy and Abyssinia is a reversal of the United States' traditional policy of the past 125 years and a major change in the application of American military force. The President's move also exceeds the legal powers granted by the recently passed Neutrality Laws by Congress. The American people now recognize this as a new "coercive policy," and its impact will extend to the Far East in the future. The key points of this policy are as follows: (1) Supporting the League of Nations' sanctions against aggressor nations within the scope of unilateral action; (2) If the British Navy wishes to implement sanctions, the United States guarantees that it will not conflict with it. This is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging the British Navy as the de facto power in the Mediterranean indefinitely; (3) Applying the same policy to other European countries.</p>

<p>(Rome) The new Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, General Badoglio, is scheduled to depart for Massawa today. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Asmara Sources believe that the new High Commissioner of East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces, General Badoglio, will soon change the strategy of the Italian forces on the northern front. The purpose is to proceed expeditiously, using light troops for rapid assaults, relying on new camel transport, supplemented by a systematic air force. The previous approach of advancing while constructing roads is no longer used. The slow advance was suitable but damaging to Italy's reputation. Currently, roads are being built behind the lines directly to the front lines. The policy of road construction before military advancement may be abandoned. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tigray Province Front Our Agency's military correspondent, Baer, reports that the newly appointed High Commissioner of East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces, General Badoglio, will depart from Naples around November 19 and arrive at the port of Massawa in East Africa on November 26 or 27. The former High Commissioner, General de Bono, will greet him at the port of Massawa. After General Badoglio arrives at the port, he will return to his country on the original ship. It is generally speculated that the war in the front will be temporarily calm before the arrival of the new commander. Judging from the speed of concentration of Abyssinian troops, the main battle on both sides will likely occur at the end of December. Currently, the Italian Second Army has repelled the Abyssinian troops defending along the Tekeze River. The clearing work in the Gheralta area is proceeding very rapidly, which proves that the number of Abyssinian troops from Aksum to Macalle is very small. In addition, all the aircraft of the Second Army are concentrated on the road from Aksum to Adwa to bomb the Abyssinian defense line attacking the Italian right flank. Also, the Italian army seized communications between Abyssinian General Seyoum and the Abyssinian Emperor in Aksum, proving that the Abyssinian army had to abandon Aksum because it could not stop the advance of Italian tanks. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tigray Province Front Military experts also believe that after General Badoglio arrives here, Italian military actions will be urged to progress rapidly. The Italian army will complete the connection between the Eritrean and Somaliland armies before the start of the next rainy season. Therefore, future marches will strive for speed. However, it is very difficult for General Graziani's southern army to capture the city of Harar because the area is in the midst of thousands of mountains and valleys, and it is impossible to encircle it without a large number of new weapons. The Graziani division still lacks this. Therefore, the northern army will focus all its efforts on attacking the city of Dessie. After Dessie is captured, the Eritrean army can be transferred to Somaliland to join forces with Graziani. It is generally believed that General Badoglio's first step after taking office will be to disregard the difficult terrain between Macalle and Dessie and rapidly advance towards the city of Gondar. In the past Libyan war, General Graziani was subordinate to General Badoglio, and the two had a very close relationship. (17th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harar Our Agency's correspondent, Lavua, reports that, according to Abyssinian military figures, the Italian army on the southern Wollega Province front is still 60 kilometers south of the Daggah Bur area. There has been heavy rain in the area recently, so the Italian army has been unable to advance. Prince Tesemma, the son-in-law of the Abyssinian Emperor, is actively replenishing military supplies in the Dolo area (at the intersection of Italian Somaliland, British Kenya, and the southern border of Abyssinia) to prepare to advance towards Daggah Bur. Thirteen wounded Abyssinian soldiers from the area have recently been transported here for treatment. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Our Agency's correspondent, Ochina, reports that Abyssinian troops appear and disappear unpredictably on the Tigray Province front, hindering Italian military operations. The Italian rear units are often harassed, which has recently been officially confirmed. According to well-informed sources, Abyssinian General Seyoum has bypassed the Italian right flank and reached the area west of the city of Adwa. However, his exact location is still unknown. General Ayalla's troops are now along the Setit River to support General Seyoum. Rumors that General Ayalla has entered Italian Eritrea have not been confirmed. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>

Now, to repay kindness with malice, who can believe it? What is Italy's crime? The crime is defending the colonial territories conquered at the cost of blood. The crime is spreading culture to dark, primitive tribes. Wherever the Italian flag goes, the light of Christianity is revived, and native tribes offer food and drink to welcome the king's army. But unexpectedly, this is how the League of Nations has been offended." (17th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>

The student riots of the past few days have resulted in the deaths of seven people and injuries to more than 200. This is only the prelude to the independence movement. Nahas denied that the movement was being directed by Italy behind the scenes and denied that Egypt was taking advantage of Britain's preoccupation with Italy to pursue its aims. Nahas said, "We want to be friends with Britain, but we do not want to be its dependency. The only demand of the Wafd Party is that Britain fulfill its promises and grant Egypt independence. We do not want to take advantage of others' difficulties, but we are equally opposed to British imperialism and Italian imperialism. Britain knows that the situation is serious, so it is prone to being oversensitive." Regarding British activities in Egypt after the start of the Italian-Abyssinian War, Nahas said, "We oppose the British fleet concentrating in Alexandria without our consent. This is tantamount to being regarded as a colony. We are willing to sign a treaty with Britain allowing the use of our naval ports in wartime, but we must sign the treaty as an independent country."

<p>Cairo Hearing that one of the students injured in the riots had died, 800 students rushed to the public hospital today to demand the body of their comrade. Police forcibly prevented the students from entering and fired warning shots into the crowd. Subsequently, British cavalry and local police arrived, rushing back and forth, swinging their sabers to disperse the crowd. The students shouted slogans such as "Down with British imperialism" and "Long live the Wafd Party" and dispersed. (18th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The Baldwin Cabinet has a total of three National Labour Party members: Lord President of the Council MacDonald, his son Colonial Secretary Malcolm, and Secretary of State for War Lord Halifax. MacDonald and his son failed in the election, and Lord Halifax has not yet decided on his position. All three are unlikely to remain in office. However, Prime Minister Baldwin believes that the National Cabinet style should still be maintained and should not be allowed to disintegrate. In addition, other cabinet members such as First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Bolton Eyres Monsell and Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister did not run for election. Among them, Monsell is likely to abandon political life, and Cunliffe-Lister will be ennobled and enter the House of Lords, remaining a cabinet member. Minister without Portfolio Anthony Eden will likely be transferred to another department. It is still unknown whether the League of Nations Affairs Department will be abolished before the end of the Italian-Abyssinian conflict. Winston Churchill, the leader of the Conservative Party's extremist faction and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, was recently re-elected as a member of Parliament in Epping. Baldwin is likely to invite him to join the cabinet. (18th Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Roosevelt Announces the Outline of the US-Canada Trade Agreement: Effective from January Next Year, for a Period of Three Years; Reciprocal Principles to Improve Trade Relations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt announced tonight that the US-Canada trade agreement, signed at the White House on Friday, will come into effect on January 1st of next year, with a fixed term of three years. After three years, either party can terminate the agreement at any time with six months' notice; otherwise, it will continue indefinitely. According to the provisions of the agreement, Canada will grant special preferential treatment to 767 types of American goods. These preferential measures are divided into four categories: (1) Direct tax reduction for 180 types of American goods; (2) From now on, American goods will be subject to the lowest tax rate paid by any non-British Empire country; (3) Canada may not freely assess the value of American goods when taxing them; (4) Canadian merchants and travelers returning from the United States will be allowed to bring in duty-free textiles, vegetables, fruits, fish, agricultural and industrial machinery, automobiles, steel, iron, groceries, electrical materials, railway materials, rubber goods, gasoline, chemicals, wooden and paper sundries, etc. The United States has also reduced duties on a wide range of Canadian goods, such as livestock, butter, lumber, etc., as well as many types of newspapers, fish products, mineral products, and furs, which can be imported duty-free. The agreement also includes a clause to safeguard free trade between the United States and its territories, and stipulates that even if the political status of the Philippines changes, the United States will still be able to grant it special conveniences. This clause is also included in the recently drafted US-Colombia trade agreement. The US-Canada treaty also recognizes Cuba's preferential status. Japan, due to the most-favored-nation clause in the US-Japan trade agreement, will naturally receive the same treatment as Canada. However, the goods of Japan and Canada do not generally compete in the US market, so this is not of great significance. Furthermore, the United States and Canada have agreed in the treaty that if either country implements exchange controls in the future, it should grant the other party a fair exchange rate. If the exchange rate difference between the two countries becomes too large, either country can propose revising the treaty. The agreement excludes the Philippine Islands, Samoa, and Guam.

<p>After the publication of the Ottawa US-Canada Reciprocal Trade Agreement today, there has been a reaction in Canada. It was learned today that after Parliament convenes, Conservative Party members will rise up in opposition. Generally, Conservative Party members say that Canada's concessions to the United States far exceed those of the United States to Canada, and Canada's interests will suffer greatly. However, this opposition movement will inevitably fail because the Liberal Party has a strong force in the Lower House, and Prime Minister King, who negotiated this agreement, is the leader of that party.

<p>US Businesses Feel Uneasy About the Removal of Tariff Barriers</p>
<p>(Washington) The rapid conclusion of the US-Canada trade agreement, and the government's disclosure of the strict terms of the agreement, indicate that American manufacturers and merchants are about to launch a strong protest because their tariff protections have now been removed or reduced. The government stated that it will explain to the country that it has little hope for the agreement, so there will be no opportunity to protest. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>British Government Satisfied, Public Expresses Concerns</p>
<p>(London) It was learned today that the British government attaches importance to the new trade agreement recently signed between the United States and Canada. Officials declare that the agreement is quite satisfactory. However, private individuals inevitably express some concerns. Many British people believe that the economic power of the United States has now deeply penetrated Canada, and Canada's affiliation with Britain will inevitably lose its meaning one day. Some British exporters and industrialists are deeply concerned about the impact of the new agreement on the Ottawa Imperial Trade Agreement. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">To Resolve Old Debts: British-Russian Negotiations in Progress; Progress in Financial Relations Between the Two Countries <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(London) The price of old Russian imperial bonds rose by more than 2% today, as rumors of negotiations making Soviet Russia recognize the bonds resurfaced. It is widely expected that the method proposed by Conservative Party member Sir Robert Horne may be a compromise to resolve the Russian debt issue. According to this method, Soviet Russia could raise loans in London with a treasury guarantee at an annual interest rate of 6-7%, and those who subscribe to these loans would only receive an annual interest rate of 3%, with the remaining interest used to clear old Russian pre-war debts. As for the funds raised, most of them would be used to purchase British goods, such as railway materials. According to Reuters, negotiations are currently underway to extend the existing credit facility to Russia when the bond matures in March next year. This shows that there has been progress in financial relations between Britain and Russia. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Ministry of Finance Explains Foreign Exchange and Commodity Price Questions <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the implementation of the new currency policy, the general public has doubts about whether foreign exchange and commodity prices can be stabilized, whether legal currency can be widely circulated, and whether reserves are adequate. The Ministry of Finance now explains as follows: (1) Foreign exchange stability issue: The three banks' unrestricted foreign exchange trading already has the function of regulating and controlling supply and demand. There is no problem with exchange rate stability. Since the implementation of the new system, the foreign exchange rates quoted by the central bank and foreign banks have not changed much. Compared with before the implementation, the exchange rate has not differed much. Foreign exchange is indeed trending towards stability, and the steps of various foreign banks can be consistent; (2) Commodity price stability issue: The commodity price increase at the beginning of the implementation of the new system was a temporary stimulus because of the misunderstanding that the new system was currency inflation. Now that the truth has been clarified, commodity prices are gradually falling. However, after a considerable period of time, due to the improvement of the issuance system and financial system, social currency has reasonable circulation, funds and credit have reasonable use, and foreign exchange is stable, international trade will fully develop, and commodity prices will naturally have a gradual upward trend. However, this is the result of national economic prosperity; (3) Universal circulation issue: Some say that Chinese people are accustomed to having silver coins and suddenly using legal currency, fearing that it cannot be widely circulated. In fact, in recent years, bank notes have already been circulating in the inland areas, which has cultivated people's habit of using banknotes, and the cash reserve ratio of our country's legal currency is higher than that of any other country, with solid credit, and universal circulation is not a problem; (4) Reserve adequacy issue: There is a misunderstanding that the cash reserves of various banks are empty, so the new system is promulgated to restrict it, and only legal currency can be used domestically. In fact, the issuance reserves of various banks are quite substantial. The current reserve ratio is above 60%. The issuance of legal currency is even more based on reserves as a representative, so the issuance reserves of legal currency will be more adequate in the future, and there is no problem. (Central News Agency Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance said that countries around the world, in view of the seriousness of financial and monetary issues, are all adopting self-defense policies. The methods are roughly as follows: England suspended the gold standard in 1931; the United States suspended the gold standard in 1933 and implemented foreign exchange control; Germany implemented foreign exchange control in 1931 and exempted from cash redemption obligations; Japan suspended the gold standard in 1931 and foreign exchange control in 1932; Italy implemented foreign exchange control in 1934; Austria implemented foreign exchange control in 1931 and suspended the gold standard in 1933; Argentina suspended the gold standard in 1929 and implemented foreign exchange control in 1931; Brazil implemented foreign exchange control in 1931; Canada, Finland, Mexico, and Norway all suspended the gold standard in 1931; Siam suspended the gold standard in 1932; the Czech Republic implemented foreign exchange control in 1931 and suspended the gold standard in 1934; Turkey implemented foreign exchange control in 1930. Our country has always been on the silver standard, which is unfavorable when exchanging currencies with gold standard countries, and the outflow of silver in recent years has greatly threatened the economic foundation. In view of this crisis, the Ministry of Finance had no choice but to decide to implement a monetary system that stabilizes finance and revives the economy. (Central News Agency Telegram, 18th)</p>

Therefore, it presented to the City Government, requesting permission to establish a fair market silver house, attached to the small loan shop, to maintain the zero-finding relief method before the issuance of silver dollar notes. All copper coins received by the tram company are to be handed over to the house for fair exchange. The city government has adopted this method. (Special Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang) Director of the Jiangsu Department of Construction Shen Baixian discussed the Yellow River flood control work in Jiangsu Province since April. The principle is to control and divert simultaneously. A total of eleven counties, including Tongshan, Pei, Pi, Feng, Huai, and Su, participated in the work, constructing 940 kilometers of levees with 11,895,000 cubic meters of earthwork, mobilizing 1,060,000 laborers. However, the Yellow River flow exceeded the controlled diversion capacity, resulting in disasters in ten counties, including Tongshan, Pei, Pi, Feng, Su, Si, Lian, Shu, and Huaidong, with an area of approximately 8,800,000 mu and losses exceeding 100 million yuan. Although the water level has stabilized somewhat, the breaches have not been closed, and the main flow remains strong, with 80% of the total flow. The downstream flow still exceeds the specified standard, remaining dangerous. Therefore, in addition to hoping for early closure of the breaches, the most important tasks are post-disaster reconstruction and relief work. Furthermore, Jiangsu Province is expediting the completion of the Huai River diversion project into the sea by April next year in preparation for potential simultaneous flooding of the Yellow and Huai Rivers.

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the adoption of the legal tender in this city, the financial situation has been relatively stable. Although prices once rose, they gradually fell afterwards. The public is quite optimistic about the future of the new monetary policy. However, from the 13th, the Southeastern Bank and Tianji Money Shop suddenly ran aground one after another. The Farmers' Bank, Xintai Bank, and other money shops such as Xiangkang, Jiuhe, and Zijue all experienced bank runs, creating a huge financial turmoil. The Southeastern Bank was established in the 18th year of the Republic and was jointly operated by naval circles and baojuan (tax farmers). It has a capital of 300,000 yuan and issues banknotes in denominations of ten yuan, five yuan, and one yuan. The military's payroll and tax payments mostly use it. Over the years, business has been relatively developed. The banknotes in circulation in northeastern Fujian are about 600,000 yuan, and those used in this city are about 300,000 yuan. The bank also manages real estate trading, and most of its loans are based on credit. The value of real estate pledged is more than 600,000 yuan, and credit loans are more than 300,000 yuan. Recently, due to the government's implementation of legal tender, there have been rumors in the market that the bank is unstable. Banknotes circulating in northeastern Fujian have gradually returned to Fuzhou, and many people have been cashing them out. On the 13th, the bank's cash reserves were only 60,000 yuan. It attempted to pledge real estate deeds to borrow 240,000 yuan from the banking community for turnover, but the banks were all tight on cash and could not reach an agreement. The bank had no choice but to cease operations temporarily and asked the Provincial Bank to dispatch a manager and two assistants to the bank to check the accounts. The market was greatly shocked to see the bank suddenly cease operations, and rumors arose. China Farmers' Bank and Shanghai Xintai Bank, both branches, were affected. Bank runs occurred on the afternoon of the 14th. Fortunately, both banks were able to cope adequately, and the turmoil subsided by evening. On the morning of the 15th, the Tianji, Xiangkang, Jiuhe, and Zifeng money shops also experienced bank runs. The Tianji Money Shop was unable to cope. The owner of the shop, Lin Qigui, and the manager, Zhou Peiqin, went to the Public Security Bureau to surrender and requested a seal. The shop had issued 110,000 yuan in tickets, and had 40,000 yuan in external deposits, while the recoverable accounts and real estate were valued at only 500,000 yuan, a huge difference. The other three money shops each paid out 20,000 to 50,000 yuan before the turmoil subsided. On the afternoon of the 15th, the Southeastern Bank held a temporary directors' meeting to discuss liquidation measures. However, the difference between the assets and cash reserves was too large, and the loans issued could not be immediately recovered, so no solution was reached. The bank's directors, Yang Shoutu, Yao Fuqian, Chen Jianjun, and Deputy Manager Chen Buyi are all being monitored within the head office. Since the turmoil began, market prices have increased again, and shops arbitrarily refuse to use banknotes from banks and money shops, and people's hearts are quite restless. The Provincial Government issued a proclamation prohibiting villains from spreading rumors and disrupting finance, and violators will be punished according to the Emergency Punishment Law. The Chamber of Commerce also held an emergency meeting on the evening of the 15th and resolved to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to order the Central Bank to allocate 1 million yuan to supply merchants, with real estate mortgaged to obtain cash to maintain commerce, but it is unknown whether this will be approved.

Recently, the market price of dry cocoons is 220 yuan per dan, but because the monetary situation is extremely tight, there are few transactions.</p>

<p>This year's Yellow River floods have caused disaster in northern Jiangsu. Regarding the prevention of the Grand Canal, the province designated Xu Dingkang, the director of the Northern Canal Works Bureau, to concurrently serve as director, and he has been stationed in Huaiyin for two days, directing and rigorously preventing with all his efforts. The counties along the river were fortunate enough to avoid major disasters. Now that the severe winter has arrived and the Yellow River floodwaters are gradually receding, flood control work is relatively alleviated. It is now reported that Xu has been approved by the Provincial Government to temporarily move the Flood Control Office into the Yangzhou Canal Works Bureau for joint operations. Technical personnel will remain stationed at work sites along the canal to monitor and prevent at any time. The remaining staff will be transferred to Yangzhou for office work.</p>

<h3 id="e84">The Process of Implementing Educational Broadcasting <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yiqiao, Section Chief of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>1.  Today's educational broadcast program is about "The Process of Implementing Educational Broadcasting by the Ministry of Education." Since the Ministry began educational broadcasting on Double Tenth Day, we have broadcast more than twenty times, but we haven't talked about the meaning and process of the Ministry's implementation of educational broadcasting. Therefore, we think it is necessary to have a chance to talk to everyone.</p>
<p>2.  Educational broadcasting is a new educational tool that emerged after the European War. In short, its meaning is to use radio waves to transmit knowledge about education. This new educational tool can be said to be a major revolution in the method of transmitting knowledge since the invention of printing. Because it takes a long time for knowledge to be transmitted through printed matter, and the effect is slow, and the printed matter itself is not easily obtained by the general public. As for educational broadcasting, it is tantamount to using the radio as a general lecture platform, and using places equipped with radios as lecture seats. Each radio can have hundreds of people listening, or thousands or even tens of thousands of people listening. Now that radios are becoming cheaper, people can buy a radio at a small cost to enable countless people to receive the latest knowledge broadcast by the radio. The impact on education is naturally easy to imagine. Therefore, this new tool of educational broadcasting is a major revolution in the method of transmitting knowledge since the invention of printing.</p>
<p>The use of radio waves to broadcast educational knowledge in European and American countries can be traced back to the Chelmeford Station of Marchoni Company in the UK in 1920. Since then, countries have followed suit and become increasingly developed, and the plans have become increasingly systematic and organized. Now, so-called broadcasting education has become the most important new educational tool in various countries. As for broadcasting stations in our country, there has certainly been no shortage of educational broadcasting programs in the past, but compared with European and American countries, the degree of utilization is naturally still very different.</p>
<p>3.  This time, the Ministry implemented educational broadcasting. On the one hand, it was because it recognized the immaturity of public knowledge and believed that it was necessary to use this new tool to give them sufficient new knowledge. On the other hand, because domestic broadcasting stations in the past were limited by the design of other programs, they had not been able to systematically broadcast knowledge in the field of education. Therefore, in May of this year, we discussed with the Central Party Headquarters how to use the Central Broadcasting Station to further promote this new educational tool. This is the beginning of the Ministry's implementation of educational broadcasting.</p>
<p>In May of this year, the Ministry decided to start educational broadcasting for students in secondary schools and the general public across the country. Therefore, we formulated and promulgated the General Outline for the Installation of Radio Receivers in Secondary Schools and Public Education Halls Across the Country, ordering secondary schools and public education halls that have not installed radio receivers to complete the installation in three semesters starting from the 24th year [of the Republic], and submit plans to the Ministry in stages by the relevant competent educational administrative authorities. At the same time, the Ministry pre-ordered 1,000 radio receivers from the Construction Committee, including AC machines, storage battery machines, and dry battery machines, based on the phased plans pre-ordered by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, and distributed them in batches for installation. The above-mentioned installation schedules have been largely submitted to the Ministry by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities. Some places that have not submitted or have not submitted completely will be able to submit them completely in the shortest possible time after being urged by the Ministry.</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about the Ministry's training of radio instructors. The Ministry, recognizing the lack of radio technicians in secondary schools and public education halls in various provinces and cities, believed that it was necessary to open a special class for training. Therefore, from July 20 to August 20 of this year, we held a National Training Class for Radio Instructors in Secondary Schools and Public Education Halls. The students were selected by the education departments and bureaus from their own staff. Although this training class lasted only one month, because it focused on radio practice and the teachers were all technicians with practical experience from the Central Broadcasting Station, the graduates were able to understand and apply the installation, repair, and reception methods of radios. Now they have all graduated and returned to their original dispatch agencies to serve. Their task is to guide the installation, repair, and reception methods of radios in various secondary schools and public education halls, and they have a major task in promoting educational broadcasting.</p>
<p>The third point to mention is the Ministry's method of hiring educational broadcasters. The Ministry, recognizing the importance of educational broadcasting, hired lecturers who are all experts with a great deal of experience in the topics they are lecturing on or the responsible personnel of government agencies. At the same time, in order to systematize the teaching materials, we also had thorough discussions in advance on how to enable secondary school students and the general public to obtain the latest and most needed knowledge. In order to make everyone clear about the content of the lectures, the items and times of each semester's broadcasts are listed below:</p>
<p>The items mentioned above for secondary school students and the general public are broadcast daily. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM, they are broadcast for secondary school students. Every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday afternoon, from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM, they are broadcast for the general public. As for the detailed topics of each item, they have also been planned and prepared in advance, and a list of programs has been distributed to all secondary schools and public education halls across the country, so there is no need to elaborate on them here.</p>
<p>Finally, one more point is that the Ministry implements broadcasting education with the purpose of enabling secondary school students and the general public to obtain practical supplementary knowledge. Therefore, detailed methods have been formulated on how to use broadcasting education so that various secondary schools and public education halls have a basis for their work. These methods, which have now been promulgated, include two types: Guidelines for the Use of Broadcasting Education in Secondary Schools and Guidelines for the Use of Broadcasting Education in Public Education Halls. Among them, regarding secondary schools, the school authorities must make students understand the time, topic, and lecturer of each broadcast in advance. Each time a broadcast is made, all students must be gathered to listen and take notes. After the lecture, the teacher must add a summary explanation. During examinations, questions related to the content of the broadcast must be inserted. At the same time, when educational administrative authorities inspect various schools, the use of broadcasting education should also be used as one of the strict assessment tasks. Regarding public education halls, the director of the hall must quickly contact local enthusiastic educators to share the responsibility of enabling the public to use educational broadcasting, and make sure that the public can come to listen on time, summarize and explain after listening, and post in appropriate places so that the public can obtain the practical benefits of educational broadcasting.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the meaning and process of the Ministry's implementation of educational broadcasting. Because educational broadcasting has only recently begun, I am afraid that everyone still cannot fully understand the past process and the meaning of implementation. Therefore, today I specifically used this time to make a general report. I hope that all educational administrative authorities, schools, public education halls, and other social education institutions across the country will pay attention to this issue and share the responsibility of promotion.

You gentlemen are either practically responsible for the administration of the Land Bureau, or rich in land administration experience, or legal technical experts. I deeply believe that the city's land problems can be simplified with your assistance, and everything can be solved easily.

In more prosperous areas, theodolite surveying was used. After the survey was completed, drawings were made, and certificates were exchanged within a limited time based on the scope of the old drawings. At present, 70% of the old Shanghai County has been surveyed, and 50% have been announced for certificate exchange. More than 100,000 land certificates have been issued.

<h3 id="e86">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Haiyuan Ship Run Aground in Guangdong, Now Planning to Transfer Passengers and Unload Cargo to Lighten Load and Escape Danger <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new Haiyuan ship ran aground in Guangdong yesterday, according to a telegram. It is currently transferring cargo to be rescued. The details are being investigated as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Running Aground</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan ship is the first of the new Sihai ships built with Gengkuan funds. The ship's price is 1.4 million yuan. The ship operates on the Shanghai-Shantou-Guangdong line and is the official passenger ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Nanhua fleet. It travels back and forth on a fixed schedule without any delay. This time, it went from Shanghai to Guangdong, first to Shantou and Hong Kong to unload cargo and passengers, and then to Guangzhou. At 5:00 AM on the 17th of this month, the ship sailed to Taishik Borreer in Huangpu, Guangdong. At that time, heavy fog occurred on the harbor. The Haiyuan ship planned to go to Bai'etan, but was blocked by the fog and mistakenly entered the channel, causing it to run aground on the shoal, and the hull sank into the shallow sand and mud.</p>
<p>Escape Awaits</p>
<p>After the Haiyuan ship ran aground, the captain, Strong Hannason, first applied full power to try to escape danger by himself in the harbor. However, the ship was still heavily loaded, the ship's draft was quite deep, and the tide was low, so it was really difficult. The captain had no choice but to send a telegram to Shanghai to report. It was Sunday, and business was suspended, so yesterday morning, an urgent telegram was sent to the Guangdong branch to be rescued as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Transfer and Towing</p>
<p>It is learned that the head office urgently telegraphed the Guangdong branch yesterday, roughly ordering the Guangdong branch to quickly send barges to the grounding site, Taishik Borreer, first to find a way to transfer the passengers on the Haiyuan ship to Bai'etan to disembark, so as to avoid passengers' anxiety, and then order a part of the heavy cargo on the ship to be transferred in order to reduce the load and float on the harbor surface at high tide, and then carry out towing rescue to Guangzhou. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the place where the Haiyuan ship ran aground is near Bai'etan in Guangdong. Once the goods are transferred, it is expected to be towed out. However, the head office withheld the news until last night, so the insurance company has been notified. It is noted that the ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 21st. Now that it has run aground, it is difficult to predict whether it will arrive on schedule.</p>

The inventories of various merchant banks are now only checked, recorded, and confirmed in number so that they can be handed over to the 三行 in exchange for legal currency in accordance with this standard in the future. According to reports from various parties to the Ministry of Finance, nearly 50 million yuan in silver coins have been received, and it is expected that 100 million yuan in silver coins will be concentrated within the year.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 17th anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Latvia. Latvian nationals in this port held a celebration, which was very exciting. Latvia is located on the shores of the Baltic Sea, 陀迦伐 A major transportation hub in Europe, and in ancient times, it was repeatedly at war with the Danes, Russians, Swedes, and Poles, becoming a famous battlefield. By the 18th century, it was completely destroyed and incorporated into the Russian territory. After the end of the European War, it gained independence. This was the first time in seven hundred years that its people had regained their freedom. Most of the people live by animal husbandry, farming, fishing, and hunting. After the country was destroyed, many of its people fled to various places, so there is probably no major city in the world today that does not have Latvians. There are currently 300 people living in Shanghai, most of whom are refugees from the European War. There are now about 2 million people in the country, who are of Indo-European descent. Their language still preserves ancient forms, which is a must-learn for researchers of philosophy. The level of education in the country is very high. The government spends about 20 million yuan in Shanghai currency on education each year. The University of Latvia has 11 subjects and about 7,000 students. English is a compulsory subject and Wibble also studies it. In 1933, there were 153 daily newspapers, 250 weekly and monthly magazines in the country. The current president is Mr. Korisis, and his prime minister and foreign minister, Mr. Upomanis, is highly respected by the people and is called "Uncle."</p>

The reporter of 華東 News Agency inquired about this from the Shanghai office of the Zhejiang Provincial Raw Silk Promotion Committee. The person in charge of the office announced the details as follows:</p>
<p>190,000担 of Cocoons Collected This Year</p>
<p>According to the survey reports of the Silk Improvement Association in spring and autumn this year, the amount of cocoons collected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is a total of 181,000 担 (Dry cocoons) measured by 司马秤, plus 17,000 担 of previous stocks of new cocoons, totaling 198,000 担, which can produce 45,000 担 of raw silk.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Exports Exceed 10 Million</p>
<p>From June to the end of October, according to the report of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, a total of 22,903 担 of white factory silk were exported, an average of about 4,600 担 per month. The value of raw silk exported this year is about 18,400,000, and silk factories have earned more than 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>110,000 担 of Cocoons Currently in Stock</p>
<p>At the end of October, according to the survey report of the Silk Improvement Association, there were a total of 112,269 担 of dried cocoons in stock in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which can produce 24,900 祖 of raw silk. According to the export volume in the previous five months, it can last until the end of March next year. Since the start of work this summer, 87 silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces with 23,197 silk reeling machines have reeled only 76,000 祖 of dried cocoons.</p>
<p>Government Work Should Stop Appropriately</p>
<p>The increase in silk prices this year and the increase in the number of factories starting work have resulted in the failure to receive new raw materials. If the silk prices go the other way, there will be a surplus of raw materials, which is completely unrelated to the Zhejiang Province's control. As for the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department's collection of cocoons, it started in the autumn of 1934. At that time, because no one cared about silk cocoons and it was also a year of severe drought, the government came out to buy them to maintain the lives of farmers. As for those purchased by the Construction Department this year, only 20% of the province's silk cocoons were purchased, and the cocoons collected were all reeled by silk factories with better equipment and work in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. There was no distinction between provincial boundaries from the beginning. If the silk market can continue to maintain its current price, farmers and manufacturers can live and work in peace next year. Government work can be limited to increasing the manufacture of silkworm eggs, guiding farmers in silkworm breeding, improving silk reeling technology, and uniformly promoting raw silk. As for the work of the promotion office this year, a uniform brand is used to promote sales in Europe and the United States. Since its opening, the selling price has changed from low to high, all following the market, and it has never been raised or suppressed, so that the raw silk trade can be circulated. It is also a trivial matter to deliver goods on schedule and ensure the quality. Shanghai exporters are very satisfied with the control measures and promotion work. They all say that if the promotion of Chinese silk can be unified and credit is emphasized, foreign trade can develop faster. In short, the government's overall planning for the control of raw silk is based on the overall situation. It is hoped that the silk factory industry can also pool their efforts and cooperate with each other, and the future of the silk industry will have a brighter future.</p>
<p>Increase Silkworm Egg Production Next Spring</p>
<p>Also, according to the Shanghai office of the Silk Improvement Committee, the National Economic Commission has planned to expand the scope and increase the manufacture of silkworm eggs during the spring silkworm season next year. There are currently 2 million improved species, and another 500,000 will be purchased to be distributed to various provinces for application during the spring silkworm breeding season. It is learned that farmers in various silkworm areas have great faith in improved varieties. Since the late autumn silkworms entered the market, they have registered with the guidance offices. In addition to setting up model silkworm leaf improvement farms in various provinces, the work of cultivating mulberry trees in various regions is also being carried out in cooperation with the China Silkworm Improvement Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The 150th Anniversary of Sino-US Commerce to be Grandly Celebrated Tonight <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>

<p>Recalling the Past</p>
<p>Sino-US trade, from its inception to the present, spans one hundred and fifty years. On this day in 1825, the American merchant ship "Empress of China" returned to New York from Guangzhou, taking six months. At that time, Britain was engaged in development in Africa, so Sino-US trade gradually developed from then on. Coupled with scientific advancements and rapid progress in various industries, celebrations are held annually on this day, partly to promote the development of trade between China and the United States, and partly to foster Sino-US diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Tonight's Celebration</p>
<p>Tonight's celebration will be on a grand scale. Prominent figures from both China and the United States, such as 孔祥熙, 孫哲生, 宋子文, 蔡元培, 吳鐵城, 顧維鈞, and representatives from various circles in this city, are all among the invited guests, totaling over two hundred people. The celebration schedule has been arranged. The chairman of the Sino-US Trade Association, 張嘉璈, and the president of the American Chamber of Commerce, 佛蘭克林, will preside.

Various recreational activities will be held in the evening to entertain the guests.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing, Shanghai, is a model prison with the most perfect facilities. It is large in scale, holding over three thousand prisoners. There are over twenty workshops for men and women, with over two thousand five hundred prisoners working daily. Therefore, although the prisoners are confined, they still have a monthly income due to their diligent work. Yesterday, it was learned that the number of criminals is increasing, affecting prisons in various places and causing overcrowding. The prison authorities, considering the overcrowding and the difficulties in hygiene, sustenance, and security, immediately followed the Ministry's orders and actively organized parole. The first batch of one hundred and twenty-four prisoners approved for parole has already been released for many days. The second and third batches, each with over one hundred prisoners, have been submitted to the High Court and the Garrison Headquarters respectively. The fourth and fifth batches, with over three hundred prisoners, have been selected, and the prison is working overnight to process the review procedures, which will be issued soon. During the implementation period of the prison streamlining regulations, the prison can parole as many as six to seven hundred prisoners. A parole ceremony will be held, during which the prison warden, 胡仁淸, will deliver a sincere speech to the prisoners, which will move them all.

<h3 id="e99">Spring Silkworm Egg Ordering Loan; China Communications Bank Agrees to Lend 200,000 <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Additional 100,000 Still Lacking; Decided to Use Surplus from Spring Cocoons</p>
<p>The World News Agency reports that the Sericulture Control Committee of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, in view of the booming overseas sales of Chinese silk and the increasing silk prices since the outbreak of the European Italian-Ethiopian War, intends to fundamentally improve Chinese silk products in order to enhance international trade and establish the reputation of Chinese silk. It is estimated that silkworm farmers throughout the province will need about 1.2 million sheets of improved spring silkworm eggs during the spring silkworm season next year. For advance preparation, special commissioners have been dispatched to silkworm egg production farms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to order one million sheets of improved eggs. The required funding for ordering eggs is estimated to be 300,000 yuan. Due to the province's financial constraints, it is difficult to allocate funds. The committee is contacting various banks, including the China Communications Bank, to negotiate loans for ordering eggs. According to banking circles, after several rounds of negotiations, the China and Communications Banks have agreed to lend 100,000 yuan each, using the spring silkworm eggs as collateral, with an annual interest rate of 1% and repayment of principal and interest within six months. A formal contract will be signed and payment will be made soon. The remaining 100,000 yuan will be used from the 100,000 yuan surplus from this year's spring cocoons by the Sericulture Control Committee. As for the spring cocoon loan to be repaid to the bank, it is planned to repay it with the proceeds from the sale of silk reeled from part of the autumn cocoons. The above transfer method has also been approved by the banking authorities, so there are no other problems.</p>

<p>Consultation with Chief Engineer Yu Yesterday Morning; Agreement to be Signed After Formulating Measures</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in response to users' requests to change the Chinese Concession to direct dialing, has repeatedly sent personnel to the Shanghai Telephone Company in the Concession to discuss revising the telephone contract in order to eliminate the manual handling of calls in the Chinese Concession. Negotiations have been ongoing for more than a year, but the telephone company has insisted that due to the differences in equipment between the two sides, the manual handling cannot be eliminated, and a solution has not been reached. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the chief engineer of the telephone company specially invited Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, to discuss the matter. It is reported that the telephone company has agreed in principle to eliminate manual handling. Once both parties have formulated measures and jointly signed a contract, Chinese Concession telephones can be directly dialed. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau has also requested instructions from the Ministry of Communications in advance in order to exchange views during the negotiations.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Flood Relief Association; Promoting the Sale of Soy Sauce to Contribute to Relief; Many People Have Been Enthusiastically Buying Goods in Recent Days <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Flood Relief Association of Various Provinces believes that the floods in various places this year are severe, exceeding those of the past. Moreover, winter is approaching, with howling north winds, and people are suffering from hunger and cold. If they do not starve to death, they will freeze to death. Therefore, this relief work cannot be delayed for even a moment. The Flood Relief Association, on behalf of the disaster victims, has appealed to all parties for donations and has held various activities to use all the income for relief. Since the start of fundraising, it has gained the sympathy of all walks of life and has received enthusiastic donations, resulting in significant results. The recent total mobilization of the Boy Scouts for fundraising is a clear example. The Chinese Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing Factory, which has been established in this city for many years, aims to promote rural products and consolidate the rural economy. Currently, its product is a type of "Three Fresh" soy sauce, which is manufactured using scientific principles and absolutely avoids oleic acid preservatives. The factory, in view of the severity of this year's disaster, is willing to sell 30,000 bottles of this soy sauce and contribute the proceeds to relief in order to save the disaster-stricken people. This measure has been implemented for many days. In addition to requesting the Boy Scouts to help with sales, the Flood Relief Association has sent letters to all sectors, requesting them to recognize and sell the soy sauce. Because soy sauce is a necessity for households, and the money is not wasted, this can both help the disaster victims and be practical. According to Mr. Shen of the factory, many people have been enthusiastically picking up the goods in recent days. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will purchase them as soon as possible to avoid missing out.</p>
<h3 id="e109">News from the Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association; The Number of Participants in Chain Relief is Increasing Daily <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association on Renji Road was reorganized in the Republic of China year 9 (1920) due to the severe drought in the five northern provinces and became a permanent charitable organization in Shanghai. It has achieved considerable success in relief and disaster prevention. It does not issue donation books to avoid abuse. Over the past decades, it has been trusted both at home and abroad. The donations directly sent to the association amount to no less than tens of millions. Each time relief is distributed, personnel are dispatched to supervise the distribution together with local Chinese and Western gentlemen. This summer, the rivers have once again experienced massive flooding, following a severe drought in the southeast. Moreover, the disaster area is spreading wider and wider. Relief efforts are now underway in provinces such as Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong, and relief funds and clothing amounting to more than 270,000 yuan have been allocated. However, the market is sluggish, and donations are extremely difficult. Chain relief has been repeatedly promoted by all sectors to gather strength and save the people suffering from the flood. Since the association complied with this, it has been praised by Chinese and foreign legal experts in Shanghai as a very legitimate method. Not only are there many sponsors, but the number of participants is also increasing daily, with monthly relief funds exceeding 1,000 yuan, and possibly doubling each month. During this tense period, it is truly a good strategy for raising relief funds. During the developmental stage, some who do not understand the content have pointed out that it is akin to gambling. However, they do not know that this method stipulates that each person donates 30 cents, of which 20 cents is for disaster relief, and 10 cents is for the chain. The rewards for those listed first in the letter are mostly not accepted but are entirely transferred to relief funds. Even those who are willing to enjoy the benefits will either use them for public welfare or help other charitable causes. There is no competitive nature. The so-called waste is small, and the preservation is great. The association has received frequent telephone calls in recent days. The matter concerns joint disaster relief, and it is hoped that all sectors will not interrupt it due to one statement, which will affect the disaster victims waiting to be fed.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Rent Reduction Movement in the Concessions <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Rongren Lane and Yuelaifang</p>
<p>Tenants of Rongren Lane and Yuelaifang on Xujiahui Road and Caishi Road in the French Concession felt that the market was sluggish and business was in decline. Rent reduction was necessary for prosperity. Therefore, they held an inaugural meeting in the lane the other day. Chen Jiufeng of the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee attended to provide guidance. Officer Hua of the Political Department of the French Concession Police monitored the meeting. Li Zhuxi, Chen Jueting, Huang Zhenming, Liu Jialin, Li Shoubai, and other five people were elected as the presidium to report on the progress of the initiative. More than half of the tenants have joined, so a formal establishment was held. The following resolutions were discussed and decided: (1) To determine the standard for rent reduction. According to the precedent of the Municipal Rent Reduction Association, rent will be paid at 60%, but the minimum limit is now set at 80%. (2) When should the rent reduction begin? It should start from September. In addition, the three months of rent owed during the Shanghai War should also be waived by the landlord. (3) How should the drinking water problem be solved? The well water used in the past was paid for within the rent. The landlords are trying to make extra profits and changed to salty well water without notice. Therefore, it was decided to restore the original state. (4) What should be done if the landlord does not agree to the request? If there is no rent reduction and no change of water, then rent payment will be stopped. The rent will be temporarily deposited in the bank for safekeeping. The designated bank and procedures will be announced separately. (5) How should members be protected? The association will hire a lawyer as a legal consultant. (6) How should litigation expenses be raised? It is generally recognized by each . After the above resolutions were passed by the entire body, they were submitted to higher authorities . In addition to the case, a letter was sent to the landlord, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Deceased Female Professor Zhang Duanzhen's Inheritance Dispute <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Duanzhen, a woman from Minhou, residing at No. 8 Changgning Lane, Jisi Feier Road, was deeply knowledgeable in literature and served as a professor at various universities. Unfortunately, she passed away on July 26th of this year after a sudden illness. Ms. Zhang's father (Zhang Zhuohou) passed away early in her childhood, and she had many siblings. Therefore, she strived to excel and studied diligently. Over the years, she accumulated savings, which, apart from generous donations to public welfare, were used to purchase stocks and government bonds, totaling over 10,000 yuan, deposited in the bank. After falling ill in Shanghai this time, she had already prepared a will on July 15th, stating that in case of any unforeseen events, all her inheritance would be managed entirely by her younger brother, Zhang Xifan. Xifan, who was studying in Shanghai, received the will of his deceased sister and, fearing opposition from others, engaged two lawyers, Yao Qiming and Cheng Xiuling, to file a lawsuit in the local court against his sisters, such as Zhang Meizhen, Lin Zhang Shuzhen, and Li Zhang Wanzhen, seeking confirmation of the will. After receiving the complaint, the court once summoned them for a hearing. However, Zhang Xifan did not appear due to illness, and the court ordered a new summons. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Pang Shurong specially opened the first court for the trial. The plaintiff, Zhang Xifan, accompanied by his engaged lawyers, Yao and Cheng, appeared in court. The defendants also engaged two lawyers, Chen Jinji and Da Jiaoxian, who subsequently arrived in court to present their defense. Zhang Xifan first recounted the previous events, followed by the testimony of witnesses Dong Zhao Yinxiang and He Zhang Lizhen, who described Zhang Duanzhen's illness in the hospital and the details of writing the will, which was very detailed. According to them, the wording of the will was based entirely on Duanzhen's dictation. Zhang Xifan further stated that he wished to use all the inheritance of his deceased sister for charitable causes, leaving a permanent memorial. When the judge questioned Zhang Meizhen and Zhang Wanzhen, they said that they also agreed to the transfer to charitable causes, but the issue of whether the will was forged should be resolved first. The judge said that they were siblings and should each make concessions, and then instructed the lawyers of both parties to conduct reconciliation outside the court before further adjudication.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Germany and the United States Restrict Trade in Military Supplies; Each Has Telegraphed Instructions to Their Shanghai Trading Houses; Transactions Not Allowed Without Government Permission <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The German trading houses in this port, including Zenchchen, Siemens, Lihe, Kongshi, Huadelong, and Qianxin, along with over thirty other major trading houses, have recently received telegrams from their headquarters in Germany stating that, according to orders from the German government, the large-scale export of military-use metal materials and other items will be temporarily suspended from the 16th of this month. All orders for such transactions must not be rashly signed without first consulting the government for permission. Additionally, major American trading houses such as Shenchang and Maosheng have also received telegrams from their headquarters stating that, starting this month, they are no longer allowed to place large orders for military supplies such as steel plates and bars, and transactions can only be completed with the permission of the American government. The telegrams did not explicitly state how to handle future transactions or when free trade would be allowed. The American side estimates that the order will not be lifted until January of next year at the earliest. Recalling the similar restrictions before the outbreak of the European War in 1914, one can imagine the situation in Europe and the turbulence in the Far East.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Ancient Vase Lawsuit <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Linsheng Must Appear in Court; Ancient Vase Temporarily Stored in Court</p>
<p>An ancient vase owned by real estate merchant Cheng Linsheng, named Guyuexuan and dating back to the Qianlong era, is now the subject of a lawsuit due to a mortgage dispute. Chi Yunfei from Fujian has engaged a lawyer to sue Jiang Yuting, the owner of Yuanzhang Jewelry Store at No. 99 Jiangxi Road, who is from Wuxi, for fraudulently obtaining the vase in the First Special District Court. The court has already summoned him and ordered him to bring Cheng Linsheng to court to testify and to bring the vase to court for further verification. This was reported in this newspaper on the 12th of this month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao of the First Special Court opened the fifth criminal court for further hearings. Cheng Linsheng did not appear due to illness, and lawyer Hu Jue appeared in court as his representative. Judge Ye stated that Cheng himself must appear in court for this case and cannot be represented. If Cheng does not appear next time, the court may arrest him. When questioned, Jiang Yuting stated that Cheng owed him 18,000 yuan in bill payments and mortgaged the Guyuexuan vase and two diamond rings to him. Cheng later took the vase away for more than a week and exchanged it for the calligraphy "Myriad Countries Come to Court," and then switched it back. He has already sued Cheng in the Second Special District Court, and because Cheng raised the issue of jurisdiction, the case was transferred to this court. The vase has been submitted as evidence. The vase is only about three inches long and about one inch in circumference. The mouth of the vase has two ears and is painted with colorful beauties. It is stored in a rosewood box, and the bottom of the box has a Qianlong imperial inscription. The plaintiff pointed out that one of the ears of the vase has a slight yellow tint. After careful inspection, Judge Ye ordered that Cheng Linsheng be summoned to court again at a later date for further questioning. The ancient vase is temporarily stored in this court.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Dancer Huang Aizhen Sues for Offense Against Morality <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Inducing Loss of Chastity, Cohabitation, and Abandonment; Dancer's Lawsuit Is Like This; Defendant Jiang Bifeng Is Absent</p>
<p>Huang Aizhen, a woman from Huzhou, is 28 years old, with a beautiful appearance, and works as a dancer in the New York Dance Hall on Zhubaoshan Road in the French Concession. In July of this year, while Huang was dancing at the Xiaoyao Dance Hall on Xizang Road, she was seduced and lost her chastity to a dance partner named Jiang Bifeng, who also swindled her out of her clothing and silver dollars. Therefore, recently, Huang's father, Huang Wenkui, acting as her legal guardian, engaged lawyer Hu Jue to file a lawsuit against Jiang Bifeng in the First Special District Court for offense against morality, requesting a summons and legal proceedings. It is noted that Huang Aizhen came to Shanghai from her hometown with her aunt, Ms. Feng, in the spring of this year to learn dancing skills in order to earn a living. In July and August, she entered the Xiaoyao Dance Hall on Xizang Road as a dancer. Because of her excellent appearance and skills, her career was flourishing, so she had some savings. Jiang Bifeng, seeing that Huang was young and beautiful, used seductive tactics. One evening, he falsely claimed to be hosting a banquet and led Huang to the Wugong Hotel on Fuzhou Road. Unexpectedly, upon entering the room, there was no one there. Huang wanted to leave, but Jiang refused, closing the door and raping her. At the time, Jiang claimed to be a shareholder in the Xiaoyao Dance Hall, wealthy, and unmarried, and firmly instructed Huang not to tell her parents about the rape. Later, he rented a house at No. 10 Chengqi Lane on Race Course Road and began cohabiting with her. However, less than two months later, their love suddenly ended. Recently, Jiang disappeared without a trace. Huang, feeling defiled and having been swindled out of 600 yuan in dance earnings and her clothing, was filled with anger and wanted to seek justice through the law. However, because Huang is only sixteen years old, she does not have the right to file a lawsuit independently under the law. Therefore, her father, Huang Wenkui, acted as her legal guardian and engaged a lawyer to file a lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the third criminal court for the hearing. The defendant, Jiang Bifeng, was absent. Huang Aizhen stated that she currently lives at No. 4 Yikang Lane on Meibeger Road, with a fellow townsman. Her father, Huang Wenkui, was unable to attend court due to illness. Judge Jiang ordered that the case be rescheduled for next Monday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Punishment for Retrieving Silver from Water <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Police Prosecute for Embezzlement; Luo San Fined Fifteen Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the legal tender policy, there have been many unscrupulous merchants who have taken the opportunity to buy silver dollars for outflow and profit. At 9:20 PM on the 10th of this month, Luo San, a man from Qingkou, suddenly heard the sound of something heavy being thrown into the Huangpu River at the Qinhuangdao Wharf in Yangshupu. He immediately went to investigate and managed to retrieve a hundred silver dollars wrapped in cloth. He intended to take them home, but he was intercepted by Hua Constable No. 3417, who questioned him about the situation and took him to the Huishan Police Station and then to the First Special District Local Court for temporary detention and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiepan presided over the third criminal court hearing. Gongbuju lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that it was impossible to find the principal offender during the investigation and prosecuted the defendant for embezzlement under Article 337 of the Criminal Law, requesting his prosecution. The defendant claimed that he only heard the sound of water and did not see any person or trace. Judge Xiao ruled that Luo San was guilty of embezzling lost property and fined him fifteen yuan. If he could not pay the fine, he would be sentenced to labor at a rate of two yuan per day. The one hundred silver dollars were confiscated.</p>

<p>Lin Chenghuan, a man from Ningbo, 37 years old, lived at No. 4 Shikang Lane, 975 Zhejiang Road, and ran a cloth shop at No. 37 Ningbo Road. Recently, due to poor business and significant losses, he faced extreme economic difficulties.

Upon investigation, the body was taken to the Philander Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Tang, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and recorder Wang Zuji, to conduct an examination of the body. After hearing the account from the deceased's wife, Lin Mengshi, Prosecutor Tang ruled that the deceased, Lin Chenghuan, male, had died from poisoning caused by tranquilizers taken before death. The body was handed over to his wife, Mengshi, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Chinese Christian Independent Church Held a Third Anniversary Memorial Ceremony for Yu Zongzhou Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National General Assembly of the Chinese Christian Independent Church held a third anniversary memorial ceremony for Mr. Yu Zongzhou. At the main entrance of the church on Xiangyin Road, a white cloth banner hung, reading "Third Anniversary Memorial of Mr. Yu Gong Zongzhou's Death," alongside the national flag of the Republic of China. The grand hall was filled with flowers, and a portrait of Mr. Yu was placed on the stage, creating a very solemn atmosphere. The meeting began promptly with the ringing of a bell to mark the mourning. Zhu Baoluo led the singing of hymns, Liu Yumei offered a prayer, Zhu Baoluo read scriptures, and then more hymns were sung. Wang Hong reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that thirty years ago, the Christian churches in our country were under the jurisdiction of Western missions, and everything was done according to the Western pastors. Chinese believers had no possibility of speaking out. However, Yu Gong Zongzhou, with the wisdom of a pioneer and the spirit of courage and perseverance, was able to form a completely Chinese Christian Independent Church. This not only opened a new era in Christianity in our country but also made a great contribution to the Chinese nation. His great achievements will be immortal. Religious affairs are essentially for the spiritual cultivation of individuals and should not be dominated by others. We used to be like newborns in our religious lives, relying on others for everything. Now that we have grown up, we should have autonomy and not blindly follow others. Yu Gong devoted himself to independence for more than thirty years. Today, Chinese churches have gradually achieved economic self-sufficiency and recovered the autonomy of church power. Looking back and looking forward, we should commemorate Mr. Yu's death every year. However, what is the significance of holding such a memorial meeting? Today, I will briefly present three points about Mr. Yu's achievements to encourage everyone: (1) Mr. Yu had a spirit of creation. One of the biggest problems of us Chinese people is that we like to imitate others in everything. We are so-called "fond of the new and tired of the old," "saying what others say," "running high and chasing the red," and "treading on the powerful." Seeing that others have some benefits, we rush to imitate them, resulting in both sides being injured, and we lack the spirit of creation and the ability to build. At that time, Mr. Yu's establishment of the Independent Church was something that others did not know and did not do. (2) Mr. Yu made friends and used people based on the principle of trust throughout his life, adhering to the principle of mutual trust and mutual establishment. He treated people with sincerity and had no suspicion or scruples. Therefore, later generations all have a positive evaluation of him. Mr. Yu did use some people improperly during his lifetime. However, we do not know that Mr. Yu had a righteous and upright mind, so he did not suspect others of having malicious intentions. He did not measure gentlemen with the hearts of petty people and adhered to the principle of "do not doubt people you use, and do not use people you doubt." This is an indispensable criterion for leaders. (3) Mr. Yu devoted his life to religious work for more than fifty years. His words and actions were completely consistent. Mr. Yu did so many great things that benefited society and relieved the suffering of individuals. Mr. Yu completely adhered to the principle of faith and practice, using faith as the warp and practice as the weft, and fully demonstrated the Christian spirit of love, sacrifice, and saving people, making everyone who heard and saw it feel convinced. Christianity has been introduced from the West for more than a hundred years, with more than 400,000 followers. Even from the establishment of this church to the present, it has been more than thirty years. However, it has not penetrated deeply into people's hearts because most people can talk but cannot act, so the work of the kingdom of heaven cannot be realized on earth, as it is in heaven. Glory belongs to the Lord. In the future, all our believers must bear this responsibility of practice, so that the original face of Christianity can be realized in the human world and make practical contributions to the country and the nation. This is the three-point significance of today's memorial meeting. After the report, the entire assembly stood up in silence for three minutes. Li Keyong led the recitation, Sun Delin reported on his life story, hymns were sung, and Reverend Lin Timothy preached. Then, You Lanjie and Hong Kunshan gave speeches, Mr. Yu's son, Zu Guang, delivered a speech, prayers were offered, and photographs were taken before the meeting adjourned. Each person was given a package of tea and snacks as a memorial.</p>

The auditorium has now been completely renovated and is about to hold an anti-drug movement conference, as well as a costume speaking performance with the theme "To Quit or Not to Quit."</p>

<p>According to reliable sources, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has begun rebuilding a steel-framed overhead bridge at Shanghai South Station since the 11th of this month to facilitate passengers. The top of the bridge will be covered with a galvanized iron canopy to provide shelter from wind and rain. However, during the construction period, all passengers boarding at the station must enter and exit through the front door. All passengers boarding and disembarking at the station should pay attention to this, otherwise, entering the station from the back door over the bridge will require backtracking and detours, which would be a waste of time. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Niece Sleeps with the Deceased for a Night Before Discovering It the Next Morning</p>
<p>Rui JiaChun, a 65-year-old from Nanjing, was a tinsmith. His wife had passed away early, and he had no children. He was an old man living alone and rented a bed in the home of Wang Dai Shi, the landlady, at No. 7 Rongyuan Lane, 225 Datong Road, Zhabei, for ten cents a month. In August, he moved to live with his cousin, Rui Chuandao, at No. 25 Jiqing Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei. Recently, due to his old age and inability to work, his life had become exceptionally difficult, so he often went to his niece, Zhu Fengqin, at No. 12 Taiheng Lane, West Gate, Nanshi. Zhu, 22 years old, was a local and worked in a sock factory on Lin Yin Road for a living. Sometimes her uncle would come to visit and give her one or two yuan. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday, Rui Jiachun went to Fengqin's place again, but Fengqin was out. Later, the landlady, Lin Yangshi, received him. Rui Jiachun went to his niece's bedroom in the pavilion. At about 11 o'clock at night, Zhu Fengqin returned home and did not know that her uncle was inside, so she went to bed to sleep. At about 9 o'clock the next morning, Fengqin got up and went behind the bed to relieve herself. She found that her uncle, Rui Jiachun, was hanging high on the bed frame and had hanged himself. Fengqin was shocked and called the landlady to come and see. She also reported the matter to the local policeman, who then reported it to the West Gate Branch to file a case, stating the above situation. The branch then ordered the local guarantor to report to the court for an inquest. In the afternoon at 5 o'clock, the court sent a prosecutor to conduct an examination on the spot, confirming that he had hanged himself. In addition to filling out the death certificate, he ordered the relatives to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>The Children's Welfare Association Commends Whistleblower Tan Guanman</p>
<h3 id="e138">Further News on the Guangdong Miss's Maid Abuse Case <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Children's Welfare Association Commends Whistleblower Tan Guanman</p>
<p>According to Huadong News, the case of Guangdong Miss Tan Huishu, residing at 47 Deren Lane, Xingjia Mu Bridge, Zhabei, abusing her maid, which was exposed by a righteous person in September of this year, has been publicly prosecuted by Prosecutor Tang of the local court since October. Zhang, the judge, has held two court sessions and, based on the fact that the charges were substantiated, sentenced Tan Huishu to one year and six months of imprisonment. The reporter notes that in November of last year, Huabei also had the case of Tianjin Miss Chen Xiangjun abusing her maid. After the Tianjin Local Court's trial, Chen Xiangjun was found guilty of repeatedly injuring the victim and was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Now, the Guangdong Miss Tan Huishu's maid abuse case is quite similar. The people are similar, the case is similar, and the punishment is similar. The reporter notes that this case was initially reported to the Public Security Bureau by the China Children's Welfare Association, which paid close attention to the progress of the case. According to the person in charge of the association, the reason why the association paid close attention to this case was entirely out of concern for the happiness of children and not out of any resentment towards Tan Huishu personally. Now that Miss Tan has been sentenced to imprisonment, it is hoped that through this lesson, she can reflect on her past actions and encourage herself in the future and never blame any individual. During the trial of this case, Patrol Officer Zuo Shaozeng of the Yongxing Road Police Station and Qi Baoqing, the gatekeeper of Deren Lane, all testified righteously without fear, which is truly admirable. As for Mr. Tan Guanman, a teacher at Qiming Elementary School, because of his reporting of this case, he was ambushed and injured by villains while walking on the road the other day. The association expresses its deep sympathy and, in addition to taking measures to assist in the arrest of the murderers, resolved at yesterday's meeting of directors to present Mr. Tan with a silver shield engraved with the words "Speak Righteously," as a memento to express its appreciation.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Continued Trial of Tang Akun's Murder Case <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly, a Man Claiming to be Akun's Uncle Appeared and Asked the Court to Seek Justice for the Deceased</p>
<p>Tang Akun, a local resident of 491 Kangnaotuo Road, Shanghai West, once served as the captain of the anti-smoking investigation team in Changzhou. After being dismissed, he remained unemployed at home. At about 8:00 AM on November 16 of last year, Tang Akun and Yan Shengquan were walking near Yan's House when Tang was hacked to death with an axe. Afterwards, Tang's wife, Tang Ji, accused Yan Shengquan, a local resident of Yan's House, of conspiring with Zhao A'er and two others to murder her husband and requested justice. After receiving the accusation, the court repeatedly ordered the arrest of the perpetrators without success. Recently, Yan secretly returned to Shanghai and was arrested by the police and sent to the local court. Prosecutor Xie Lian investigated and confirmed the facts and prosecuted him in the criminal court for the crime of joint murder. Judge Wu Deying has held several trials without a conclusion. The details have been repeatedly recorded in previous newspapers. It is now learned that this case was again heard by Judge Wu at 2:00 PM yesterday. The plaintiff, Tang Ji, appeared in court and recounted the previous events and requested the return of 7,600 yuan in private compensation. Another plaintiff, Tang A'gen, then testified, stating that he was 55 years old, from Jiading, and made a living by farming. Tang Akun was his nephew. He had three brothers, all of whom have passed away. Akun was the son of his elder brother and recognized him as his father, which was known throughout the hometown. In recent years, because he was old and weak, the family expenses were entirely supported by Akun. Since Akun was murdered by Yan Shengquan last winter, his livelihood has been cut off. Moreover, he was the only son in the third generation. He learned from his fellow villager Zhao Xiaomao that the murderer had been arrested, so he requested justice and the return of more than 10,000 yuan in private compensation. The judge was very surprised by the testimony and asked Tang Ji, "Do you know Tang A'gen?" Tang Ji replied, "Tang Akun and I have been living together for five or six years. I have never heard of this uncle in the countryside." Tang A'gen said, "I often go to her place (referring to Tang Ji). She is my child Akun's concubine." Tang Ji lowered her head and remained silent upon hearing this. The judge ordered Zhao Xiaomao to testify. He was 26 years old, from Jiading. On November 5, he was drinking tea and reading the newspaper at the Siyang Tea House in Caojiadu, reading aloud that the murderers of Tang Akun had been arrested and detained. He was overheard by this old man (pointing to Tang A'gen), who claimed to be the uncle of the deceased and inquired about the details reported in the newspaper. Unexpectedly, two other tea customers at another table, Li Wencai and Zhang Suilin, joined the conversation. Li and Zhang both said, "We used to work with Tang Akun. Tang had a feud with Yan because of selling opium, so Tang Akun was actually murdered by Yan. Today, I was invited to court by Tang A'gen to testify." Yan Shengquan, who was in custody, testified that he was 36 years old. After Tang Akun was hacked to death, he went to other ports to work as a car driver. He has now returned to Shanghai due to unemployment. It is a false accusation to accuse me of escaping. Please investigate." The judge said that the case was complicated and required further investigation and summoning of witnesses and adjourned the hearing. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Fang Shunxing Arrested for Privately Selling Guns <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Fang Shunyu (also known as Fang Zhenqing), a Ningbo native residing at 11 Yaohua Lane, Pingliang Road, was arrested for selling a handgun to Li Yunfei, who was working as a bodyguard for a doctor, for 110 yuan in the Yaojia Stone Bridge area of Nanshi in 1933. Xue Shilin, deputy captain of the Xinming Road Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, learned of his residence. At 7:10 PM the day before yesterday, he asked the Yulin Road Patrol House for assistance. Head detective Pan Yunlong was dispatched secretly and arrested Fang at his address. He was taken to the Patrol House and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the previous events and expressed his agreement to the transfer. When questioned, Fang Shunyu confessed that the gun belonged to a friend who used to be a river police officer in the Shanghai military camp. He only received 5 yuan for the travel expenses, and the rest he evaded. According to Captain Xue Shilin's report, Judge Xiao Xiebin ordered Fang Shunxing (Fang Zhenqing) to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Robbery on Miller Road - Suspect Detained Awaiting Further Interrogation <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>At 4:05 AM the day before yesterday, four robbers broke into the home of Ningbo woman Bin Leleshi at 21 Lane 303, Miller Road, and brandished a handgun to silence them. Lu Zhongliang, a child selling fresh fish who lived in the same house, took the opportunity to run out of the back door and reported to the two Chinese constables at 993 and 3371 nearby and shouted to catch the thieves. In desperation, the robbers forced their way out, firing a shot as a warning. As a result, a Ningbo man, Chen Afu, was apprehended, and a handgun, seven bullets, and one bullet casing discarded by the robbers were found in the lane. He was taken to the Hongkou Patrol House and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the previous events and requested a postponement to arrest the accomplices. The handgun and bullets were presented for inspection. Bao Leleshi, the victim, and witnesses Lu Zhongliang and Dai Fuchang, testified about the robbery. When questioned, Chen Afu confessed that he was invited by Zhou Changsheng, who was at large, to commit the robbery. The handgun was held by two strangers. He evaded the rest of the questions. Judge Xiao Bianbin ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Hu Nanshan Pharmacy Again Sued for Dispensing Wrong Medicine <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Ding Jinren, a carpenter from Yancheng residing at 54 Tan Family Residence, Liyuan Road, Shanghai South, suddenly fell ill with typhoid fever in late September. He invited Chinese medicine practitioner Ling Furen to diagnose and prescribe a prescription. He took the prescription to Hu Nanshan Pharmacy at 137 Kangti Road in the French Concession to have it filled. After taking the medicine home and decocting it, his illness worsened. Later, he found out that the original prescription had been changed to a prescription for a woman surnamed Ding to regulate her menstruation. He negotiated with Hu Nanshan Pharmacy but failed to resolve the matter. He then hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Hu Zhenxi, the owner of Hu Nanshan Pharmacy, Sun Longshui, an apprentice, and Dr. Ling Furen of negligence in their business and causing injury, requesting an investigation. The owner of Hu Nanshan Pharmacy also accused Ding Jinren's younger brother, Ding Jinrong, and the doctor of colluding in an organized extortion attempt and sued them in the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate. He hired a lawyer to defend against the charges in the Second Special District Court and filed a counterclaim for defamation. Judge Xiong Huicui of the Second Special District Court has held two hearings and summoned Ni Jinren, another doctor who had treated a woman surnamed Ding, to testify. Because the victim Ding Jinren's condition was not stable, he ordered a postponement for another hearing. The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate investigated the case of Hu Nanshan Pharmacy and others accusing Ding Jinrong, Ling Furen, and others of fraud and decided not to prosecute. The owners of Hu Nanshan Pharmacy and others were dissatisfied with this decision and filed a reason for reconsideration. Now, Ding Wangshi, the woman who mistakenly took Ding Jinren's typhoid fever prescription at the time (29 years old, from Dongtai, husband Ding Chenghua, 38 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at 100 Dakang Lane, Kangti Road), has now filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court with her husband Ding Chenghua, accusing Hu Xingqing (32 years old, from Yuyao), the junior manager of Hu Nanshan Pharmacy, Sun Longshui, and others of negligence causing injury and requesting a legal investigation. Upon receiving the complaint, Judge Xiong Huicui presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court at 4:00 PM yesterday. The plaintiffs, Ding Chenghua and Ding Wangshi, arrived on time, and the defendants, Hu Xingqing and Sun Longshui, also arrived with their defense lawyer, Yu Xiufang. The court first questioned the year and origin of both parties. After the plaintiff briefly stated the purpose of the lawsuit, the court ordered the court to request the investigation file from the local court. Because the file has been sent to the High Court, it has not yet been retrieved, so it was postponed for another hearing. A copy of the counterclaim filed by the defendant was given to the plaintiff in court, and the court was adjourned.</p>

<p>Harassing Women on the Street</p>
<p>Zhang Baisen, a local resident of 68 Xicheng Lane, Xidou Road, French Concession, was walking home with his wife, Ms. Ding, the night before last (17th) at around 11:00 PM. While walking near the Hengmao Lane area of the Ba Xian Qiao Mai Gao Bao Lu Road, Chen Haichun (23 years old, local, residing at 93 Xiafei Lane, Xiafei Road), a advertisement canvasser for a newspaper on Edward Road, hired a rickshaw and brushed past Zhang and Ms. Ding. Chen then reached out and touched Ms. Ding's face, intending to harass her. Zhang Baisen, who was standing nearby, witnessed this and asked his wife if she knew this person. Ms. Ding replied that she did not know him. Zhang believed that the man should not be acting irregularly on the road since he did not know them and went up to reason with him. Unexpectedly, Chen not only did not admit his fault but jumped out of the rickshaw and became violent, punching Zhang. The two wrestled together. Ms. Zhang Ding's attempts to stop them were ineffective. The patrol arrived and stopped them, taking Chen into the patrol house. Zhang also followed, reported that he had been assaulted and injured, and requested legal action. After questioning by the patrol head, Chen was ordered to be detained. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Officer Yuan Jiahuang of the Police Department explained the case, stating that the defendant was detained for injuring others and that the victim was currently being treated in the hospital, requesting a postponement. Investigator Chen Jiuxiang reported the results of the investigation. Zhang Ding also testified about the previous events. The defendant confessed to the assault, stating that it was due to temporary intoxication. The court verified the confession and ordered a postponement for another hearing on the 21st. The defendant was ordered to provide a 500-yuan store guarantee pending trial. Without a guarantee, he was detained.</p>

<p>The Three Cup brand cigarettes produced by De Xing Tobacco Company in Shanghai are made of golden, tender tobacco leaves with a mellow flavor and are sold at a low price, which sets them apart. Since its launch, it has been a favorite, and its popularity has remained unchanged for a long time. Last year, the factory sacrificed 500,000 yuan to pioneer the offering of gifts, which was especially welcomed by smokers. It has recently been heard that the first batch of sacrifices has been fully redeemed. It has recently decided to continue sacrificing 500,000 yuan to purchase a large number of exquisite daily-use gifts and entrusted the factory's general distribution office on Kaifeng Road to redeem them at will, allowing smokers to exchange empty boxes to increase interest. Also, since the central government issued the legal currency order, the prices of all goods have risen sharply. Due to cost factors, the factory also plans to raise prices soon. However, before the price increase, it will continue to supply as much as possible to the cigarette shops that sell them, so that customers who like to smoke Three Cup brand cigarettes can have the opportunity to buy cigarettes at a fair price. Therefore, the number of people purchasing wholesale recently is endless.</p>

<p>Respected Editor, in your esteemed newspaper’s fourteenth day's third page, local news section, under the headline "Fu Luli Road Cracked Down on Drug Manufacturing Facility," it was reported that at No. 8 Hequnfang, Fu Luli Road, someone had privately set up a morphine manufacturing facility. This is actually a mistake; the case was cracked at No. 5 Hequnfang. The facts were obvious to everyone on that day. Your newspaper mistakenly published No. 8, which greatly affects the reputation of the innocent residents of No. 8. Therefore, we truthfully report this matter and hope you will make a correction. Respectfully addressed to the Editor. From the Zhang Residence, No. 8 Hequnfang, Fu Luli Road. November 18, 24th year.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Ways of Political Reform (Continued) <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>(November, Republic of China Year 24, in Shanghai)</p>
<p>— Respectfully dedicated to the comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party and gentlemen who are interested in discussing political reform —</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the Implementers of the Constitution:</p>
<p>(1) After the draft constitution is passed by the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party, it should be extensively publicized using various methods. At the same time, a deadline should be set to effectively carry out universal public education in each province, city, and county, and to complete local self-government, as preparation for the implementation of constitutional government. The deadline may be determined according to the conditions of each locality, but should be no more than one year. During this period, the central government should strictly supervise. If local officials and senior party officials fail to promote or prepare adequately, they should be severely punished.</p>
<p>(2) Once the draft constitution has been passed by the Fifth National Congress, the date for convening the National Assembly should be set simultaneously, so that the work of preparing for self-government in each locality has a final goal, and at the same time, the people have a reasonable opportunity to participate in politics. The period should also be set within the year of the Republic of China's 26th year.</p>
<p>(3) After the National Assembly passes the Constitution and formally promulgates it, it will naturally be the period for the implementation of constitutional government. However, the provisions of the Constitution, in consideration of certain local circumstances and certain factual limitations, can still separately stipulate the time of effect, and it is not necessary to force all provisions to be implemented nationwide at the same time.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the Content of the Constitution:</p>
<p>(1) The name of the constitution is the same, but the content of the constitutions of various countries is different. Whether it is a presidential system, a cabinet system, a committee system, a republic, or a monarchy, there can be a constitution. The unwritten constitution of the British style, the written constitution of the American style, and the multi-party alternating system of parliamentary politics are of course examples; the constitutions of Soviet Russia, Italy, and Germany, which adopt a one-party dictatorship system that strengthens administrative power, are also examples. Therefore, we should break the "erroneous notion that whenever a constitution is mentioned, parliamentary politics cannot be avoided," and consider the national conditions ourselves and make a fundamental decision. I believe that our country's constitution should explicitly define "The Republic of China as a Republic of the Three Principles of the People," and at the same time, in spirit, should recognize "The Chinese Nationalist Party as the only party for building a Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People." Only in this way can the people, to whom sovereignty belongs, enjoy the right to participate in politics on the one hand, and on the other hand, organizations that violate the Three Principles of the People are not allowed to exist. Only then can the existence of the Republic of the Three Principles of the People be guaranteed. Therefore, there should be negative restrictions on the qualifications of citizens of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(2) The Constitution should be based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of the Five-Power Constitution, the essence of the "separation of power and ability," to clearly divide the four "political powers" of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, and the five "governing powers" of administration, legislation, judiciary, examination, and supervision. "Governing power" is entirely handed over to the government, and "political power" is controlled by the people (during the transition period, the Nationalist Party leads the people in exercising it). The National Assembly is the organ for exercising "political power," and the central government (including the president and the five yuan) is the organ for exercising "governing power." Therefore, the Legislative Yuan should be recognized as an organization under governing power, and is by no means equivalent to the national assembly in other countries with parliamentary politics. In other words, the Constitution should clearly recognize that the Legislative Yuan is not a supervisory body used to oppose the President or the Executive Yuan, and only the National Assembly has this qualification.

<p>— (Baling)</p>
<p>Hating the job you do: This is a common ailment among young professionals, but, young people, we need to think; there are so many unemployed people in society right now, and many college graduates cannot find jobs; having a place where we can earn a living is already a blessing in the eyes of the unemployed; what else do we have to complain about? In my opinion, we should try our best to find interest in our profession and overcome this bad habit of resenting our jobs; we must know that "the other side of the hill looks greener" is human nature, and at the same time, it is our greatest enemy!</p>
<p>Zeng Wenzhenggong said: "If people can take a step back and think, they can be at peace with themselves." I think this sentence is very meaningful. I hope that the young people who generally resent their current jobs will keep this in mind and carefully savor Zeng Wenzhenggong's words. I believe that they will definitely be able to gain infinite benefits and increase their interest in professional life.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Sports Meet Thirty Years Ago <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Pastoral Old Man</p>
<p>The evolution of personnel changes follows the trajectory of evolution. Isn’t it ridiculous to look at the past from today's perspective? And the future will also see today in the same way. The establishment of schools in eastern Zhejiang, in the middle of the Guangxu period, Jianhu in Shaoxing, and Chucai in Ningbo, all opened up the national atmosphere. My town is a small county; the establishment of schools was also very early. Regardless of the curriculum at that time, the sports meet held in the entire county is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The venue was the broad plaza in front of the ×× Temple Hall, where teachers and students from various schools gathered. There was no opening ceremony, no speeches or moments of silence, but the order was well maintained, and there was no noise. There were no events called field events or track events, but there were races. Races were also called walking races, and there were also obstacle races and two-person three-legged races. Jumping included long jump and high jump. It was not called pole vault, but high jump with a pole. There was soccer, but no knowledge of tennis, basketball, or volleyball. There were also arithmetic races, rope skipping, stick jumping, horizontal bar, calisthenics, and blind and mute races, which are not seen today.</p>
<p>What was even more laughable was that after the sports were over, the entire group formed a long snake formation, exited the west gate, and entered the east gate, with everyone singing sports songs, the school flag leading the way, and military music following. The steps were neat, and the atmosphere was high-spirited. Spectators lined the road, and villagers were shocked by the strange event. The so-called military music was one drum and one trumpet, blowing unbearable tunes. Thinking about it today, I can't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow. Some of the young athletes in this juvenile sports meet have now emerged as prominent figures. The pastoral old man has achieved nothing, and after visiting the National Games, recalling the past, the scene is still vivid. Sighing that time cannot flow backwards!</p>
<h3 id="e158">Record of a Certain Dancer <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuying</p>
<p>Two years ago, my aunt's family employed a maid (commonly known as Big Sister), whose appearance was only average, but she loved to dress up. Because she couldn't stand the poor life in the countryside, she had a falling out with her parents, so all the money she earned was spent on clothes and cosmetics, and not a single cent was sent back.</p>
<p>After living there for half a year, she felt that the money she earned was not enough to spend? So she secretly borrowed money from a shop assistant in a rice store. The shop assistant was quite interested in this maid, so he always granted her requests. Two months later, this secret was discovered by my aunt, so she dismissed her on the pretext. But she rented a house with the shop assistant and lived together.</p>
<p>However, the shop assistant's monthly income was limited, so how could he afford such a wife who spent money lavishly? So then, because his hands and feet were not clean, he was dismissed. At that time, it happened that there were two dancers living together in his house. Chatting idly, they talked about a way out. The maid followed the dancers, learned for a few days, and scraped together a set of clothes, and followed the two dancers into the dance hall.</p>
<p>In the first one or two months, she was only able to provide for the two of them to eat and drink. From the third month onwards, she gradually became popular, and her clothes were changed every three days, every two days. Her husband, the shop assistant from the rice store, although he still stayed at home, guarding the door and cooking, since the end of last year, he also started wearing a suit when he went out. Click-clack, he looked quite impressive. Sometimes children followed behind him, calling him "trailer" and "turtle," but he pretended not to hear.</p>
<p>Because his house is located in the back alley of my aunt's house, I still see her often now. Indeed, she is now a woman who is more modern than anyone else.</p>

<p>Zhiqian smiled and said: Why is Beihai so angry? Beihai walked up to him, still panting a little, shaking his head and saying: Now, I believe that everything in the universe is transferred by matter. If I had political power in my hands, I would first solve the slavery system. The word "slavery" does not only refer to those who are actually working as slaves. There are also those who are not slaves in name, but in fact, they are acting as slaves, and they should also be liberated. Because their suffering as intangible slaves is ten times greater than that of tangible slaves. He spoke like a traveling orator, walking into Cheng Zhiqian's room, and put his schoolbag heavily on the table, making a loud noise. Then he slapped the table with his hand, very hard. He turned his head and said: Humph! Unreasonable! Zhiqian sat on a chair on the side, gently stroking his cheek with his right fingertip, just looking at him and smiling. Only when he stopped speaking did he ask: Beihai, who are you saying is unreasonable? Am I offending you? Beihai then realized and couldn't help but laugh, saying: How dare I say that Mr. Cheng is offending me. But I'm talking about the high-class guests in Little Western Paradise. Mr. Cheng, you are also one of the high-class guests. This, perhaps, is where I am sorry to Mr. Cheng. As he said this, although he still had a lot of bitterness, his face was still red. Zhiqian saw that he was coming from the front, and the level of dissatisfaction with the guests in Little Western Paradise could not exceed that of Jia Duocai, so it was easy to know what he meant. He smiled and said: I understand, is there any new news? Beihai stood in the middle of the room, and said everything he had just seen and heard, with gestures. Naturally, the descriptions were more exaggerated than the actual situation. (363)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The deeper meaning of the Empress Dowager's words did not move me much at first. It was not until now, after experiencing so many years in the course of life, that I realized that her thoughts were indeed very reasonable.</p>
<p>Before noon, she hurriedly issued a very strange and actually meaningless order; she ordered Li Lianying to personally supervise the eunuchs who were in charge of flowers, to chop down the magnolia flower that had suddenly bloomed, break it into pieces, and bury it in the soil; she also strictly ordered them to bury it in a most secluded place, so that no one could step on it, and so that it would not receive any sunlight or rain, so as not to revive it.</p>
<p>After this matter, which she considered most important, was done, her face looked better. Then she said to me:</p>
<p>"A person who bears too heavy a responsibility, it is best to be able to forget his responsibility at any time, otherwise his responsibility will inevitably feel especially heavy, and may even make him weak. Now let us forget our responsibilities! Didn't you say that you can sing Li Bai's 'Qing Ping Diao'? Very good, sing it for me once."</p>
<p>At that time, although her worries had eased a lot, there was still no smile on her face. She only told Li Lianying to quickly call two musicians, one playing the flute and one playing the Xiao, and bring their instruments into the palace to serve. The skills of these two people were very good, and their ensemble was very moving. I also reluctantly put on a smile, raised my voice, and sang Li Bai's Qing Ping Diao; when I was singing, I secretly looked at the Empress Dowager, but saw that the many wrinkles on her face had gradually relaxed, and a more vibrant light had flashed in her eyes. The comfort she needed was actually obtained. I hope she can be quiet from now on.</p>
<p>My Qing Ping Diao was soon finished, and the clear and melodious sounds of the flute and Xiao also dissipated. The two musicians kowtowed and went out.</p>
<p>As these tall palace courtyards were immersed in the dark sky, we were once again shrouded in an atmosphere of serenity, peace, and solemnity! (459) (End of the book)</p>
<h3 id="e162">Record of Chrysanthemum Viewing at Zhenru Temple <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>Walking in the dust of the world, I quite long for a clean environment to wash away my worries. Just then, Mr. Huang Yueyuan, the owner of the Zhenru Huang's Nursery, and my friend, the famous calligrapher Xie Xianou, sent me an invitation. I gladly accepted and ordered a carriage. I arrived at the garden very early, and the guests had not yet gathered. The host told me that the chrysanthemums this year were not as prosperous as in previous years, and that continuous wind and rain had particularly abused the tea. The flowers were already drooping and wilting. If I had come half a month later, there would be no more cold flowers and late blooms to admire. He also said that he had recently met with a certain gentleman and discussed chrysanthemum cultivation methods with him, and there were many experienced talks, such as: "Spring should be refreshing, summer should be moist, autumn should be humid, and winter should be dry. Spring and summer should be lean, strengthening its quality and nourishing its energy; autumn and winter should be fertile, promoting its flowers and cultivating its roots. As for the adjustment of yin and yang, it takes even more effort. Overemphasis on yang is beneficial to flowers and leaves, but not to roots and stems. Overemphasis on yin is beneficial to roots and stems, but not to flowers and leaves. From this, it can be proved that it is appropriate to have yin at the beginning and yang at the end, so that it can be successful." The secrets of chrysanthemum cultivation are all revealed here. Guests came one after another, and then Mr. Huang led us on a tour around. The chrysanthemums were gathered next to the glass flower house. The ten-foot pearl curtain, with its delicate stamens fluttering, hung down to within a foot. The Xueqing lotus flowers were as beautiful as young women. The Lixiang chrysanthemum was like a regular flower, but when held in the hand and smelled, it had the fragrance of pears. It is said that it was a treasure of the inner court, and Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty distributed it to Zhang Xun. Zhang's gardener then privately sold its seeds to others, and thus it became widespread throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. This small anecdote is quite worth mentioning. Later, the host hosted a banquet for the guests in the bamboo house, pouring grape wine and eating chestnut chicken. The taste was delicious, and we were drunk and full. We said goodbye and left the garden, and with Huang Jiping, Hu Bozhou, Yao Jiguang, Ding Juntao and others, we visited the Canadian Plantation. The ridges and paths were all covered in glass houses, more than ten in total, connected by heating pipes. Entering them, it was as warm as spring. The most abundant plants were tomatoes, with vines rising and bearing fruit, red like frost, which was very pleasing. They ripened twice a year, and the food supply depended on them. Cabbage grows in the north and is cold-resistant and not afraid of frost and snow. It is also placed appropriately to suit its nature. A water suction machine is also set up to draw water from the low-lying areas, so drought is not a concern. Such operations are still an innovation in the country, and I am happy to include them. I deeply hope that they will expand their efforts, so that all kinds of fruits, vegetables, flowers and trees will be bathed in the civilization of science? The future benefits will be ten or a hundred times greater than today, and we can be sure of that.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Random Thoughts on Mount Huang (Middle) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaodie</p>
<p>I believe that to tour Mount Huang, the best route is to enter from Bitter Bamboo Creek and exit from Tangkou, so that seeking out scenic spots and exploring secluded places is easier. There are five advantages: From Bitter Bamboo Creek to Lion Forest, the road is flat, and you can go straight up in a sedan chair, which is easier than Tangkou to Manjusri. From Bitter Bamboo Creek, viewing the Nine Dragon Waterfall is advantageous, while from Yungu, viewing the Nine Dragon Waterfall is disadvantageous. Secondly, the beauty of Lion Forest lies in Starting-to-Believe Peak, Scattering Flowers Dock, and West Sea Gate. However, to tour Starting-to-Believe Peak, you must climb Stone Bamboo Shoot Ridge, to tour Scattering Flowers Dock, you must go to Scattering Flowers Convent, and to tour West Sea Gate, you must go to the top of Songlin Ridge. To watch the sunrise, you must go to Bright Top. Without sufficient stamina, you cannot fully enjoy the scenery. Coming from Bitter Bamboo Creek, you arrive at Lion Forest with a smooth journey, without any hardship, your courage is very strong, and you can explore all these secluded and dangerous places. If you come from Manjusri, your stamina is already exhausted and you cannot cope. I asked the only Qing monk, and he knew that those who toured Lion Forest only went to Qin Terrace when climbing Starting-to-Believe Peak, those who toured West Sea Gate did not even know there was Songlin Ridge, and those who toured Scattering Flowers Dock were only three people before me. This is half due to time constraints, but half is also due to stamina limitations. Therefore, coming from Bitter Bamboo Creek is more convenient, thirdly. The bath in Tangchi is unparalleled in the world. Those who come from Tangkou must first take a bath as a pleasure, but after one bath, they rush into the mountains, and after the hardship, their tour is over and they want to bathe in the fairy pool again, which is impossible. Coming from Bitter Bamboo Creek, the bath in Tangchi is the final reward for their mountain tour, so that when they are baptized with nectar, they can look back at the clouds and mountains, and have the obvious pleasure of ascending to heaven. Moreover, the wish to tour the mountain has been fulfilled. If you love this fairy nectar, you may as well linger every day and enjoy the pleasure of undressing, fourthly. The essence of Mount Huang lies in the area from Half Mountain to Lion Forest. Exiting from Yungu inevitably involves a little less touring. Coming from Bitter Bamboo Creek, you enter the scenery step by step, and the scenery becomes better as you advance. By the time your tour is over, there is still the bath in Tangchi to take, transcending the mundane world. Compared to those who exit from Yungu, it makes people feel the sigh of the end of the song and the dispersal of the people, and the green peaks on the river. Therefore, I believe that the entrance to the mountain should really be moved to Taiping, under the scenic spot of Mount Huang, in order to conform to the old site, and the people in Peach Blossom Spring will not be disturbed by the noise of vehicles and horses.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Excellent Academic Performance of New Chinese Boxer Indemnity Students Studying in the UK <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters News Agency, London) Mr. Silcock, Director of the Chinese Academic Society, recently returned from inspecting various northern universities and told a Reuters representative that the new Boxer Indemnity students have all settled into their studies smoothly. A total of twenty-four students arrived in the UK in September, including: one studying rayon manufacturing, one studying textile chemistry, one studying wool textiles, two studying aeronautics, two studying naval construction, one studying glass manufacturing, one studying electrical engineering, two studying industrial chemistry, two studying mathematics, two studying animal husbandry, one studying fruit science, one studying human geography, one studying geological geography, one studying tropical pathology, one studying physiology, one studying English, one studying Western history, and one studying law. Among them, fruit science is a new science of grafting fruit trees, which can make fruit trees bear abundant fruit for more than five years. After five years, they no longer bear fruit, but it is also easy to make them bear fruit again. In terms of social life, the students have made many friends. There are about forty students in Manchester. The Anglo-Chinese Association has recently been established, with Sir Stewart as the president and Mr. Mead, a professor of Chinese at the University of Manchester, as the secretary. Mrs. Bryson, who was famous in China, also entertains Chinese students there, and her residence is now a place for these young people to gather and chat. Professor Roxburgh of Liverpool University constantly guides Chinese students to engage in social activities and observe the UK, from which the students benefit greatly. There are fifty Chinese students in Edinburgh, and they have recently established a club in the university district. When Chinese students first arrive in the UK, they often suffer from language problems. According to Mr. Silcock, the English proficiency of this year's group of students is still considerable. He reiterated that Chinese students must improve their English before coming to the UK. Among the students who came to the UK in 1934, there are Mr. Zhang from Beiping and Mr. Zhu from Tianjin, who are studying at Manchester. They are young and eager to learn and have invented a very useful machine. They hope to use it to control the Yellow River flood. Each Boxer Indemnity student is given a fee of £288 per year. Those who enter Oxford or Cambridge University are given an additional £30. According to Mr. Silcock, although this amount is just enough for their needs, it must be spent very carefully, because students have various expenses during holidays, plus clothing and book fees. If they are not thrifty, they will be in financial straits. Mr. Silcock also said that if the China Boxer Indemnity Fund could take this into account and generously increase the allowance, it would be most welcome and certainly necessary, and the custodians can trust that this money will not be misused.</p>

<p>Intelligence testing is an invention of modern educational science, and its application in education is very extensive. Excellent schools in Western countries invariably use it as the sole tool for admission, grading, and examinations. In the past, our country had various educational standard tests compiled by the Chinese Educational Improvement Society, and there were also revised Binet intelligence tests. However, the procedures were complicated and not very suitable for kindergarten and lower grade elementary school children. In view of this, the Municipal Education Bureau adopted the Labyrinth Intelligence Test materials of Baudette in the United States in the previous year and went to various cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to test about 10,000 kindergarten and elementary school children. The materials were statistically organized and compiled into a non-verbal intelligence test suitable for our country. Now, the report is printed as a special issue in the second volume and eighth issue of the Great Shanghai Education Monthly published by the Bureau. The content is divided into seven chapters, listing the implementation of the test, the distribution of results, and the opinions on adaptation. It is said to be a new contribution to educational research in recent days. Subsequently, each primary school and kindergarten intelligence testing, this material is more appropriate, our city each primary school entrance examination or semester end, and may request the Bureau to send people to guide the testing.</p>

<p>— Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"I think you often love to associate with Mr. Ha, and you've thrown Mr. Bei aside," Mrs. Shu said deliberately and slyly.</p>
<p>"Yes, I certainly have; I hate when I can go out and patrol the forest with Mr. Ha, but I have to plow the fields and weed. Mr. Bei thinks that kind of thing is boring and says Mr. Ha is crazy, because he would lie for hours, staring at a fish in the river or a bird in the tree."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Bei is a farmer by nature, and he doesn't know that the work of a naturalist is just as interesting, and maybe just as useful, compared to his own. Don, if you really love these things, I think you really love them, and I like to see this situation, you can have time to study them, and there are also books to help you; but in addition to this, I want you to do one more thing, and to do it tirelessly, otherwise you will regret it later, and feel that you have to start all over again."</p>
<p>"Yes, teacher," Don said docilely, but his face showed that he was inevitably frightened by the seriousness of Mrs. Shu's last few words, because he had no connection with books, but he was clearly determined to study anything she mentioned.</p>
<p>"Do you see that cabinet with twelve drawers?" This was another unexpected question.</p>
<p>Don had indeed seen two tall, old-fashioned cabinets, each standing on one side of the piano; he knew them well, and often saw nails, chestnut paper, and similar useful items taken from the various drawers. He nodded and smiled slightly. Mrs. Shu continued,</p>
<p>"Well, don't you think those drawers are a good place for you to put eggs, pebbles, shells, and moss?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that's great, but you don't want to see my things, as Mr. Bei said, "piled up everywhere," do you?" Don exclaimed, suddenly sitting up, his eyes shining as he looked at the old furniture.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was affected by renewed rumors in North China that Japanese soldiers were increasing their forces in places such as Yuguan and Qindao.

Temporarily, a major drop in prices could be avoided. The 48th house, which was long on the market, was covered by the 46th house, and it was a rare opportunity. At present, the trend is temporarily small, or still upwards. However, the shift in the environment cannot be predicted. Yesterday morning, the market opened with a lot of volatility. Demobilization fell by about 1.5 yuan. Other shares also fell by 2-3 jiao to 7-8 jiao. Although the 46th house was trying to pull up the market, the anger of the public was difficult to overcome. Individual investors were very sensitive and followed the 46th house's buying and did more. In the second round, the 46th and 78th houses bought. It was not a small amount. Market prices rose. Demobilization rose by 1.3 yuan. Other shares rose by 3-5-6 jiao. In the afternoon, the market fluctuated slightly. The 46th house raised prices as soon as they fell. There were many short-term traders. The market price was able to stabilize because of the power of the 46th house. If the 46th house does not relent, it will be difficult to overcome the environment. Otherwise, the situation may collapse. In the end, most shares made 5 fen to 1 jiao. A small number of shares earned 3-5 jiao. Distant demobilization earned 1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 29,446,600 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

The indices for industrial, railway, and utility stocks all rose to new highs for the year. At the close, short sellers covered their positions in anticipation of the Canada tariff agreement being announced on the weekend, leading to more active trading. Commercial and mining stocks were particularly strong, automobile stocks were firm, the bond market rose slightly, and stocks on the small exchange also rose. Half-day trading volume was 1.64 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Indices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e203">Yarn and Cotton   Manufacturers Said to be Delivering Goods   Yarn Prices Fall by One Yuan This Month <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Distant Months Remain Firm Due to Reduced Yarn Inventory</p>
<p>The yarn market is stable, gradually showing signs of settling down. This is largely due to the calming of rumors about the current situation, and after the local authorities dispelled these rumors, market sentiment has become more peaceful and the market has returned to normal. However, due to the approaching delivery period this month, although buyers are preparing to take delivery, it is said in the market that manufacturers are also delivering goods. Therefore, near-term prices fell in the afternoon, but distant months remained firm due to the reduction in yarn inventory.</p>
<p>Gold Rooster Turns Downward in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, prices for all months were uniformly high. The market price for gold was good, and general unfounded rumors subsided, improving sentiment. There were few new sellers, and the first round of prices for each month rose by 7, 8, or 9 jiao. By the second and third rounds, it was heard that the cotton market was flat and spot yarn transactions were sluggish, resulting in a slight decline. As a result, the price for this month fell by 4 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day, while distant months rose by 1, 3, 4, or 5 jiao. The market turned softer at the afternoon opening as factories were reportedly delivering goods this month, and bullish speculators at Tongji also emerged, dampening sentiment slightly. However, most major bulls remained unmoved. As a result, the price for this month fell by 6 jiao, while distant months showed mixed gains and losses, ranging from 1, 2, or 3 jiao. Sold were 650 bales of Dafu, 1,000 bales of Tongji, 700 bales of Yuda, 450 bales of Yichang, 400 bales of Xincheng, 300 bales of Daji, and 300 bales of Tongfeng. Purchased were 400 bales of Yukang, 300 bales of Mingde, 1,100 bales of Hexing, 550 bales of Gengfeng, 700 bales of Shenji, 550 bales of Runkang, 450 bales of Changfeng, and 350 bales of Dachangcheng. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Still Slow</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are sluggish. According to statistics, a total of 421 bales were purchased by various merchants throughout the day. Prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>|       | Amount |         | Amount |     | Amount |</p>

<h3 id="e204">Large Batch of Cotton Passes Inspection   Cotton Market Becomes Loose <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly weaker, as American and Indian cotton, after rising for several consecutive days, had a correction yesterday, weakening sentiment. Bullish speculators at Xincheng also emerged, causing the market to become loose. However, bullish speculators at Tongji continued to buy aggressively. The amount of cotton that has passed inspection at the cotton inspection office this month has reached 40,000 dan. It is said that Japanese merchants are buying a lot of it.</p>
<p>Zheng Dan and Bullish Speculators at Cheng Emerged</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market, the market was strong due to the good cotton market. Prices for near-term months rose by 2 or 3 jiao to 1 jiao. However, as the market progressed to the consecutive months, Xincheng suddenly sold off, causing market sentiment to falter, falling by 5 fen to 1 jiao. By the second round, bullish speculators at Tongji returned to buy aggressively, supporting prices. As the market moved toward the close, the yarn market weakened, pulling down cotton prices. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5 fen to 2 jiao. At the afternoon opening, although there was ample news of deliveries this month, Dafu also covered their short positions and rebounded. As a result, the price for this month rose by 1 jiao and a half compared to the morning closing price, while distant months fell by 5 fen. Sold were 2,500 dan of Zhenda, 1,200 dan of Tongfeng, 9,000 dan of Xincheng, 1,500 dan of Yikang, 1,100 dan of Tongji, 1,000 dan of Yuanda, 1,000 dan of Shenji, and 1,000 dan of Yuan Yi. Purchased were 1,900 dan of Dafeng, 2,600 dan of Dafu, 5,500 dan of Tongji, 2,500 dan of Yuan Yi, 1,000 dan of Changfeng, 2,900 dan of Yuan Xingchang, 1,200 dan of Xincheng, and 1,300 dan of Guangfeng.

<p>Sales of Baled Cotton Are Not Bad</p>

<p>Last week, the cotton market trended strongly upward due to rising prices abroad. Although profit-taking bulls closed out positions, they were no match for new buying and short-covering by speculators. Exporters had some transactions to offset sales to Europe and Japan. China showed little interest. Japanese demand was disappointing. However, the most eye-catching event of the week was Indian exporters continuously purchasing Pingguol on behalf of Japanese merchants. The new cotton season is generally going smoothly, and movement is also quite good within some cotton gins. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the flour market, prices for all months were trending steadily. Due to favorable quotations for foreign wheat, although there were rumors of spot foreign wheat orders the week before, recent reports indicate they were inaccurate, so sentiment among outsiders has stabilized slightly. However, the unstable situation in the north has caused actual sales to stagnate as people wait and see. By the afternoon opening, the market was even more lifeless and transactions were extremely scarce, with only about 100,000 bags traded in half a day, a world of difference compared to the week before. Observers fear that if actual sales continue to stagnate, there may be a decline in the near future.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat market, prices for all months were generally stable. Due to fluctuations of about 1 jiao in Chicago and a rise of 1 jiao in Canada, market sentiment was stable as fluctuations in foreign wheat were minimal and both buying and selling activity decreased. Very little reaction. However, by the afternoon opening, transactions for all months were still scarce. Although buyers remained quiet, domestic wheat inventory was becoming increasingly scarce and spot foreign wheat was still uncertain, so prices remained slightly firm despite the quiet. Prices for all months were up by 3 fen. The spot wheat market saw active trading with stable prices. Shandong Suzhou and Bengbu wheat opened at 4 yuan, 9 jiao, and 4 fen, Shaoxing wheat at 4 yuan, 7 jiao, and 6 fen, Tiantai wheat at 4 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen (or 8 jiao for lower grades), Wuyi wheat at 4 yuan, 9 jiao, and Taizhou wheat at 4 yuan, 6 jiao, and 3 fen. Fuxin bought 1,000 bags, Shenda and Xinda bought 1,500 bags each, and Fufeng bought 300 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice saw brisk arrivals and sales. The market has an ample stock, and new arrivals keep coming. Rumors are also rampant. The market originally showed signs of leveling off, but the Tianjin merchants suddenly stepped up purchases, and local merchants and hoarders became active again. Therefore, after the opening price in the morning, all grades of higher-quality rice showed a promising trend. However, due to too many rumors in the market and the lack of activity from Ke hoarders, the market leveled off again in the afternoon. A total of 2,000 bags of Gan rice, 360 bags of Yong rice, more than 1,700 bags of Wen-Tai rice, and 250 bags of Fuzhou rice were sold throughout the day. Prices were similar to the previous day. Foreign rice was scarce and prices were firm. Yesterday, there were 200 bags of Siamese rice and 50 bags of No. 3 Saigon rice, with prices gradually increasing.</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources of various merchant groups were even more abundant, with more than 80 arrivals (totaling more than 16,000 shi). The local sales market has been generally flat, and it was even worse yesterday when two rice shops declared liquidation, causing great losses to merchants. Therefore, all merchants are wary, leading to even slower sales. As a result, the price of Hou-Zao and other Japonica rice fell by as much as 3 to 4 jiao. About 3,000 bags of Bao-Wei Thin Rice, from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, etc., were sold, and prices only decreased by 1 to 2 jiao. Beiyang Jian-Huo rice fell by a jiao or so. Yin-Bian rice also decreased by 2 to 3 chi.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were more than 60 arrivals from various routes in Hexia. Bai Japonica rice was sluggish and slow to sell, and prices fell by another 2 to 3 jiao. Bao-Wei Thin Rice sold slightly better, and prices decreased by about a jiao. Zao rice sold in small quantities and prices increased by a small jiao or so. Yangbu Jian rice prices were also reduced by 1 to 2 jiao, and Bai Yuan rice also decreased by a small 2 jiao. Du Jian rice was weak, with few inquiries, and other types of rice also decreased by a small jiao or so.</p>

<p>–––––Donations May Be Exempted</p>
<p>Since foreign merchants opened sesame trading at eleven yuan, the market situation has been firm, prices have been rising steadily. The total number of transactions last week was around 3,800 tons. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson sold at twelve yuan, but there was no response to the telegram. Yuanxing Foreign Company received a reply, so it immediately sold 300 tons at a price of twelve yuan for delivery in December. Therefore, the spot raw sesame market is popular. Yesterday, 2,300 to 2,400 bags of various sesames were opened. Because some felt that the Guangdong Province drama donation delegation had returned to Shanghai and claimed that exemptions could be obtained, factory sales of yellow beans resumed. Yesterday, a total of more than 7,000 bags of various beans were sold, and prices rose by three or four fen. There were also more than 1,400 bags bound for Shantou and Chuzhou. Therefore, the future situation has become stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained stable. The guild set the price for No. 24 coarse white sugar at 22 yuan and 5 fen. Re-exported goods were priced at 7 yuan, and transactions took place. Zhenji No. 1 fine white sugar from local factories was priced at 21 yuan, a decrease of 1 jiao. Prices for Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 remained unchanged.

<p>Tianjin red dates, due to a relatively abundant harvest, had been gradually decreasing in price. Yesterday, it was heard that some merchants were opening prices, which rebounded by four or five jiao compared to before. The trend has tightened and merchants are unwilling to sell at market prices.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Oil Market   New Asphalt Oil Is Already Popular <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>New Macheng Oil from Hankou Has Also Arrived</p>
<p>Asphalt oil is currently in the new production season. Because of good harvests everywhere, the production period is earlier than expected. Lan oil from Zhejiang is increasing in production daily. Various presses in the Jiaxing area of western Zhejiang have started pressing Ben Che oil, and new oil has arrived in Shanghai. The first batch of goods is selling for 18 yuan per dan to Shanghai, but there are not many transactions. Because the candle and incense shops in this port are doing very little business, the usage has decreased, so the sales of asphalt oil have not been strong. Moreover, the current situation is difficult and credit is tight, making promotion difficult. However, prices are already low, and it is feared that there is little hope of further price reductions. The market situation in Hankou is also very stable. Chongjing oil is priced at 13 liang, and some merchants are unwilling to sell. A small amount of new Macheng oil has already arrived in Hankou, and Chen oil is also priced at 12 liang and 5 qian. Fortunately, sales are not strong. If the sales market becomes more active, price increases will be inevitable, as the cost for merchants is high. Therefore, they will consider increasing prices as soon as they have a transaction. Local merchants in this port have very thin inventories. The agreed-upon selling price for Chongjing oil is 21 yuan and 2 jiao per dan, and Macheng oil is 19 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>Qimen black tea is a famous specialty of our country. It was previously heard that the government, in order to develop foreign trade, intended to bring Qimen tea under the unified trade of state-run cooperative organizations. Subsequently, the Qimen Tea Industry Association and the Shanghai Tea Industry Guild expressed the advantages and disadvantages of the plan and requested the abandonment of the previous proposal. It is now heard that the central government also considers this matter to be a form of competition with the people for profit. In consideration of the business operations of the majority of merchants, the matter will still be handled by merchants.</p>

<p>40-foot-long ribbed steel bars are seeing large-volume purchases from merchant groups and construction groups. The price is good, as industry colleagues who hold the goods have a firm mentality. The estimated price is 130 yuan per ton, and better-quality steel bars are priced at 135 yuan. It has been found that more than 200 tons of steel bars have been opened for sale in the market in the past two days, but the inventory is low, which has improved sentiment.</p>

<h3 id="e218">The Problem of Nearsightedness <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhang Ji</p>
<p>A Tokyo dispatch from the 13th: "Recently, the number of nearsighted students in Japan has suddenly increased. Fifty to sixty percent of all students need to wear glasses. The Ministry of Education considers this a major problem in education. The School Building and Equipment Council invited Dr. Nagai, Dean of the Medical Department of Tokyo Imperial University, Professor Oyama of the Engineering Department, Dr. Kamitsu, Chairman of the Illuminating Engineering Institute, Dr. Ito of the Film Promotion Association, and Mr. Iwahara, head of the Physical Education Division of the Ministry of Education, to the Ministry of Education on the 12th. They reported on the results of recent experiments conducted at the university-affiliated schools of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on the effects of lighting, desk placement, and shape on students' eyesight."</p>
<p>In today's era of advanced optics, nearsightedness is not difficult to correct with lenses. However, it is still a physical defect. Therefore, it is better to prevent it than to try to fix it after the fact. The Japanese Ministry of Education considers the fact that more than half of elementary school students are nearsighted to be a major educational problem and is studying countermeasures. This is of great significance for improving the health of the nation's citizens. Whether or not the nation's citizens are healthy is largely determined during childhood. Nearsightedness, in particular, often develops gradually during childhood due to a lack of attention to eyesight. Therefore, the most effective way to prevent future citizens from developing nearsightedness is to pay attention to elementary school students.</p>
<p>There are no accurate statistics on the number of nearsighted people in our country, but in general, most intellectuals are nearsighted, while fewer people in the working class are nearsighted. In recent decades, school education in our country has gradually developed, but due to practical limitations, little attention has been paid to classroom lighting and students' line of sight from their seats. This has already affected students' eyesight, and the phenomenon of burning the midnight oil under the test system is even more unimaginable. However, the people of our country have not paid attention to this serious problem.</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Education has begun to pay attention to the problem of nearsightedness. I believe that the problem of nearsightedness in our country is even more serious than in Japan and requires appropriate countermeasures. It is also particularly urgent, and I hope that the responsible authorities will not shirk their responsibility and will quickly take steps to improve the situation.</p>

<p>— Written by Jiang Mi</p>
<p>Northwest of the Kunlun Mountains, at the point where Buzhou Mountain is interrupted, steep cliffs stand upright, facing each other like city prices on the left and right, forming a natural gatehouse. Behind the gatehouse is a sea of water, vast and boundless, connected to the sky. In front of the gatehouse is a flat land, covered with lush green grass and many fallen fruits. The mountain is covered with strange trees, with leaves like jujubes, flowers the color of gold, and calyxes like agate. The flowers are as large as magnolias and have large, peach-shaped fruits. White clouds swirl on the top of the mountain, mingling with the color of the sky. (1)</p>
<h3 id="e220">Storytelling <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>The days in winter have grown shorter. Confined in their cramped thatched huts, the children are even too listless to play their favorite game of hide-and-seek. When they see the last rays of the sun reflecting from the opposite mountain valley onto the open ground, they immediately raise their small eyes and search the sky for crows returning to their nests. After being cooped up all day, they can now tell their grandmother a lie: "We're going to the bridge to look for Dad." And like a flock of ducklings leaving their coop, they slip away.</p>
<p>The sky is filled with gray clouds. Crows circle the treetops, their calls like the wails of ghosts in the deep mountains, leading the sick to suspect that some misfortune may soon occur. The children run onto the bridge, staring at the setting sun in the opposite mountains, comparing the size of the sun each sees – this is based on a Mid-Autumn Moon story their grandmother told, saying that if the moon appears as large as a bathing tub, it signifies the arrival of a true emperor. So the children will shout that the moon is as big as a cartwheel. Among their companions, in their small wisdom, they search for the most enormous thing they see in their daily lives to boast about being the emperor. Later, they compare the sun to the moon. As long as there's a chance to compare, everyone scrambles to be the emperor.</p>
<p>The sun has completely disappeared into the mountain valley. Only a few streaks of purple-gold light are reflected on the distant clouds, which has almost become a habit. At this time, the intermittent clanging of the bamboo clapper of the old neighbor selling sweet congee floats over from the official road. His carrying pole is reversed, with the congee stove carried behind him. He wears his tattered felt hat pushed back on his forehead, sometimes singing love songs from his youth. Seeing the children at the bridge, he calls out from afar: "Business was good today, all the congee is sold out. I'll save some for you tomorrow." He smiles, turns the corner by the orange grove below the pond, and waves to the children.</p>
<p>Without sweet congee to eat, the children are not disappointed. Having been confined for a day, they're happy to slip away to the bridge, like letting a tethered ox graze freely. They watch the sun, play emperor—they are already quite content. Moreover, after the sweet congee seller returns, they can meet their father. Their father can make all kinds of sugar horses and sugar boats to sell in the city. His carrying pole has a spinning wheel. The section with sugar horses and sugar boats is just a narrow line; it costs one copper coin to spin it once. But those sugar horses and sugar boats are carried in and out every day without ever being spun. Father only makes some odd</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>and ends of sugar pieces to fulfill a large market; these scraps are still left over every day, and the children look forward to them. When Father's carrying pole reaches the bridge, everyone jumps up to grab the sugar pieces to eat. Although Father shouts: "Slow down! Slow down! Go home and divide them," they are snatched up clean before they even get home.</p>
<p>Grandmother hears their noise and also supports herself with a cane to come to the door to see what's happening. "Was business good?" she says to her son, then touches this child's head, that child's head, and says with a smile, "Don't fight, your father is tired!"</p>
<p>Father puts the sugar pole down in the house and takes out his dry tobacco pipe from his waistband to light it and smoke. The children surround the sugar pole, counting the copper coins Father earned today from a cloth bag. Father leans back in his bamboo chair and says to Grandmother: "Today was a general market day; there were many happy events in the city. Good luck, I did a lot of business!"</p>
<p>The children hand the money bag to Grandmother and crowd around Father, clamoring to go to the city to play. Father holds the youngest brother in his arms, and one by one, they all gather around Father's knees. Father touches one's face, smells another's mouth, laughing. Grandmother is busy preparing dinner in the back room. Naturally, the children all swarm to the table again, seeing the same old dishes. The eldest child says:</p>
<p>"Dad did good business, let's eat meat tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Although Grandmother rolls her eyes at him, Father agrees, saying he'll bring meat back tomorrow. Father quickly eats dinner, lights the stove, and prepares to make scraps of sugar. The children surround Grandmother, wanting her to tell a story. This is the daily evening ritual. Grandmother has no fresh stories left, but the children don't believe her. Some grab Grandmother's cane, some climb onto stools to pull at Grandmother's false hair bun. Grandmother gently hits them a few times, and finally begins:</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there was a family that had a son... and the moon looked as big as a cartwheel... later he became the emperor... that was Emperor Taizu of Ming..."</p>
<p>Before the story is finished, the children, one by one, fall asleep leaning against Grandmother's knees. When Grandmother carries the children to the back room, Father says softly: "Mom, you should sleep too, I'll come when I finish a few sheets of sugar." He raises his head and looks out the window, "Tonight, the moon looks as big as a bathtub, but it's a pity the children are all asleep..."</p>

<p>The Joy of Rural Life</p>
<p>The joy of rural life is without sighs, my humble thatched cottage is all I need. In spring, I raise silkworms to provide clothes, in winter, the surplus is white rice. The joy of rural life is truly unrefined, drunk and singing loudly, patting my belly. Chickens and dogs bustle in front of the door, hemp and mulberry thrive on the ground. Although there is no pearl wine with palm fronds, there is clear wine in abundance. Although there are no pork or mutton delicacies, there are fish and shrimp to satisfy. Although there are no longans or lychees, there are water chestnuts and lotus roots. Although there are no exotic vegetables, there are "wu song" and tender "fei" sprouts. Although there are no singing beauties, there are village girls accompanying me. Rice I grow, wine I make, cotton I spin, coarse cloth I weave. I don't care about petty poverty, I don't care about great wealth. A leaky boat is still passable, half is my own, no need to hire. Just eat meat, don't be vegetarian, yellow-legged chicken, cook in a pot, add some salt, some vinegar, simmer taro, fry tofu, eating slowly until dusk approaches. Bamboo bed, soft straw mattress, just stay overnight until tomorrow, such joy is truly timeless.</p>

Suddenly, my body is on the side of a vast ocean. All around are steep cliffs. I jump into a small boat to be the boatman. Ignoring the wind and waves, rushing forward. Suddenly an island stands before me. I leave the boat and step onto the land, full of fun. Because of the beautiful birds singing joyfully. Towering strange rocks, water gurgling. Trees on both sides are extremely lush. There are also exquisite stone caves, taking the work of heaven. Entering the cave deeper and deeper, traveling a hundred steps to see the sky. Originally, it was a vast plain, a wide road. Moreover, peach blossoms cover the ground, brightly red. Extremely beautiful, like red rain. Swaying in various poses, like crimson clouds. The fragrant wind fills the flower country. Spiritually pleased, heart filled with joy. Chickens and dogs hear each other, rural neighbors connect. Travelers greet each other politely. There are several, graceful and slender young women. Light clothes revealing their chests. Their clothes are unlike those of humans. An old immortal with a child's face and crane's hair comes. Saying that this place is a Peach Blossom Island, a tranquil realm. Children, it is truly a joy to meet you here. We are, people who came here to avoid the chaos of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Remotely separated from the mortal world, the road is impassable. Coming to his home to drink fragrant tea. The taste is the same as jade nectar. I ask, the country is in danger. What high plans are there to save the declining situation. The immortal says, the weak are prey to the strong, it has been said since ancient times. Only hold on to perseverance and become heroes. Human power can turn the heavenly numbers around. The theorem of cycles has its end. After a short moment, the light fades. I and him, promise to meet again, hastily say farewell. Winding through the peach blossom spring. The sky is dark, a strong wind rises. The clothes are thin, the body cold. Busily searching for a boat to sail in the sea. Who knows, suddenly a sea monster, long and large. The bloody mouth faces the boat. Heart and gall tremble, oar falls. Ignoring life, closing both eyes. Later, I open my eyes and see nothing. Originally, I was sitting alone in the room. The sound of rain outside the window hasn't stopped. The fragrant tea on the table is still warm. Realizing, the roar of the sea monster was a neighbor's belch. A dream of Nanke. I only hope to visit the place again. To visit the immortals in Peach Blossom Spring. The lingering interest of Liu Lang is even stronger.</p>

<p>— Zhi'er</p>
<p>I saw a "antique new book—Mother" in the market. Looking closely, I realized that it was a special issue of Tianyi Company's new film "Mother".</p>
<p>The "Mother" special issue has a "Meng Teaching Son" picture in the "antique" yellow floral design.</p>
<p>According to those who have seen the test screening of "Mother", after reading the special issue, there is no need to watch the movie, because "Mother" is a "new" "Meng Mu Teaches Son" - this sentence has a problem, readers should focus on "Meng Mu Teaches Son", the so-called "new" is that she wears a cheongsam and a suit.</p>
<p>It is said that after the publication of the "Mother" special issue, Gao Tianxi made a small fortune. "The thing is this": Tianyi Company originally only planned to collect 200 yuan in advertising fees in the "Special Issue". Mr. Gao had "far-sightedness" and saw that there was a profit to be made in this, so he contracted it. As a result, the advertising fees reached a huge 400 yuan, and Mr. Gao pocketed 200 yuan in one go.</p>
<p>—It is predicted that Tianyi Company will release a "special issue" for each new product in the future. (Editor's note: There is a reason for this, but there is no evidence to check, so just note it and wait for correction.)</p>

<h3 id="e229">Architect Xu Jingzhi Selected for the Architecture of Tan Guoli's Central Museum <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Construction Cost 1.4 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The preparatory office of the National Central Museum, after selecting the address next to the Zhongshan Gate inside the city, engaged thirteen architects of Chinese nationality through the Construction Committee to participate in the design selection. The Construction Committee also formed a review committee to carry out the review, which was completed earlier. The first choice was architect Xu Jingzhi of Xingye Architectural Firm in this city, who was hired as the architect of the museum. Xu said that most of the architectural designs had been finalized, but there were still some minor architectural details that needed to be modified. Xu recently returned to Shanghai from Beiping to work on modifications under the guidance of Liang Sicheng, an engineering consultant to the Central Museum Construction Committee. Construction may begin within the year. The process of design selection and the detailed architectural plan are recorded below.</p>
<p>Design Selection Process</p>
<p>The architectural design regulations were issued on June 5th of this year, inviting thirteen renowned architects to participate in the project: (1) Li Zongkan of Shanghai, (2) Li Jinpei of Shanghai, (3) Xu Jingzhi of Shanghai, (4) Xi Fuquan of Shanghai, (5) Zhuang Jun of Shanghai, (6) Chen Rongzhi of Guangzhou, (7) Lu Qianshou of Shanghai, (8) Tong Jun of Shanghai, (9) Guo Yuanxi of Tianjin, (10) Dong Dayou of Shanghai, (11) Yu Binglei of Nanjing, (12) Yang Tingbao of Beiping, (13) Su Xiaxuan of Shanghai. All twelve contestants except Su Xiaxuan submitted their designs to the preparatory office of the Central Museum by August 20th, numbered in order using the Heavenly Stems, and handed over to the five review committee members for review. The members were: Zhang Daofan, representative of the Construction Committee; Hang Liwu, representative of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees; architect Liu Minzhen; Li Ji, director of the preparatory office; and Liang Sicheng, specialist committee member and engineering consultant. On September 2nd and 3rd, review committee members Li Ji and Liang Sicheng reviewed each design in detail. The design with the "Ren Jie Di Ling" (Outstanding People and Resourceful Land) seal was disqualified for violating the regulations. Most of the remaining eleven competitive designs exceeded the budget or the area did not meet the requirements. The following points were used to analyze each design:</p>
<p>(1) Overall site layout, (2) Layout of each hall, (3) Relationship between halls, (4) Size of the area, (5) Possibility of future expansion, (6) Vertical traffic between floors, (7) Light distribution, (8) Interior height, (9) Simplicity and ease of structure, (10) Overall three-dimensional layout, (11) Layout of each facade, (12) Detailed programs for each part of the building, (13) Other</p>
<p>Xu Jingzhi Wins First Prize</p>
<p>Among them, items 1, 2, 3, and 5 were especially scrutinized. Using a secret ballot, the "Yi" design was unanimously selected as the winner. The original comments of the review committee are recorded as follows: "In the overall layout, the author was able to overcome the difficult limitations of the irregular "cleaver-shaped" site and master it. The narrow "handle" part connecting to Zhongshan Road was made the main entrance, and the "Yuanmen" was used for the east-west streets to create important gateways, showing that the author had considered the importance of the roads. The front garden is lively and easy to attract visitors. The asymmetrical layout also facilitates the phased construction of the three halls independently. The overall building's consideration of the terrain height is unmatched by other designs and is a special feature of this design. Looking at each hall: the public hall at the entrance is extremely suitable. The hall leads to the exhibition areas of each hall on both sides, and the directors of each hall and the director of the museum are also located in the four corners of this hall, making communication convenient. The working areas of each hall are on the ground floor below the director's office, concentrating the work without interfering with each other. In terms of work, the organization is very flexible. In terms of floor area, only this design can meet the regulations and even exceed them. Most of the exhibition halls are on the same floor, which avoids visitors having to go up and down stairs, which is also a special feature of this design."</p>
<p>"The vertical traffic of the working area of each design is convenient. Most of the exhibition rooms are well-lit except for a small portion, and they are of varying heights, making it easy to accommodate exhibits of different sizes. On the exterior, the three-dimensional interlocking connection of the three halls and the museum's administrative department is very appropriate. The main hall and the exhibition halls of the three halls are in stark contrast and can be harmonized. The offices, exhibition halls, and storage rooms of the three halls are fully expressed on the outside, without the disease of false concealment, which are all features of this design. In each part and component, the author shows a deep understanding of Chinese palace architecture, so it was selected."</p>
<p>The author is architect Xu Jingzhi of Xingye Architectural Firm in this city. Xu is a rising star in the Chinese architectural world in recent years. The Agricultural Experiment Station in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing and the recently completed Shanghai Fish Market were selected. He is honored to be appointed as the architect of the Central Museum, a huge project worth 1.5 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e230">New Daxia Company Building to Be Completed Soon <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Ah Shou</p>
<p>On the Bund, another magnificent new-style building is about to appear. This new building belongs to a large department store company called Daxia, located at the corner of Nanjing and Xizang Roads. The building has nine floors, covering an area of approximately five acres, with an additional three acres for future expansion. The bottom four floors are purely for the company's business and sales, and the remaining five floors are planned to be developed into a recreational and entertainment center.</p>
<p>According to the architects Zhu and Yang who are responsible for the building, no other department store in Shanghai has a larger floor area than this emerging company. Each floor is approximately 4,000 square feet, and there is a basement sufficient for the needs of each sales department. The most attractive features of the new building are: (1) Escalators allow people to ascend as if walking on flat ground, automatically rising and descending; (2) Eight new-style, high-speed elevators are available for passengers; (3) The latest electric freight elevators have also been installed to facilitate the transportation, supply, and distribution of goods; (4) The air circulation throughout the building has also been considered. The ground floor and basement are equipped with hot and cold air conditioning control, so that customers and staff can enter the building as if nothing is happening, even in the heat of summer or the cold of winter; (5) The internal installation parts strive for simplicity and generate ten thousand times the efficiency, so that goods do not take up much space and customers can easily choose.</p>
<p>The fifth floor is planned to be developed into a tea room and restaurant, striving for a grand scale and making the most of the space. As for the other upper floors, the goal is to make them entertainment venues to entertain guests, or to specially open up a cool and refreshing place to escape the summer heat, and to provide Chinese theaters, Chinese and Western cinemas, stages, etc. In short, the upper floors will be made an area for entertainment and enjoyment as much as possible. No expense will be spared to make it magnificent and welcoming, a place where guests will never tire of visiting. The rooftop garden is planned to be arranged in a Chinese style, with pavilions, terraces, towers, temples, and peaks. During the summer, strolling among them, looking out at the racecourse in the distance, Nanjing Road nearby, and admiring the magnificent scenery of birds singing, flowers fragrant, pavilions, and terraces, feeling the cool breeze blowing, one's mind becomes clear and intoxicated in the realm of art, and the summer heat is completely dispelled.</p>
<p>The new building is not yet fully completed and is currently being decorated. Once the interior is arranged and the exterior is improved, a good day will be chosen for the opening. However, the upper-level entertainment venues cannot be arranged and decorated properly for a while, and a few months' delay is decided. Thus, after about a year of construction, a new page in the history of Shanghai architecture, a nine-story grand new building, the Far East New Department Store, is about to appear before our eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Design of Factory Buildings (Part 1) <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Ping</p>
<p>In the midst of the call for industrial revitalization in China, although there is an economic downturn, many industries are closely related to national defense and are therefore being gradually built. When we design a factory, we must at least design according to the factory laws stipulated by the central government, taking into account the interests of the factory itself and the safety of the workers. In Shanghai, there are many industrialists and capitalists? Their factory interior designs are so-so, leading to major disasters. The rupture of a boiler can mean the lives of hundreds or thousands of people. This is such a serious problem! A safe factory design is based on the following three principles:</p>
<p>(1) Solid Construction! If the construction is not solid, the vibration of the machinery will cause the walls to tilt.</p>
<p>(2) Sufficient Lighting! Insufficient lighting greatly affects production and has a huge impact on the health of workers.</p>
<p>(3) Appropriate Materials - The selection of building materials is the most important part of factory design. For example, steel-reinforced concrete is the best building for factories. Wooden buildings are not suitable for factories that are prone to explosions.</p>
<p>(1) Site Selection</p>
<p>Site selection is the first problem to be solved in design. In theory, it is determined by supply, manufacturing, and demand. Supply is the problem of raw materials. The factory should be near the raw material production area. This is a fixed axiom, because if it is too far from the raw material production area, it will cost a lot of transportation, which will increase the cost. This is not in line with economic principles. Other things to pay attention to are the problem of power. The so-called power is coal, water, and gasoline. We know that every factory needs these three things. Sometimes, the place we plan to use has raw materials and coal, but the water supply is insufficient or the water composition does not meet the requirements, so we have to change the original plan. Secondly, what is related to site selection is manufacturing. We know that manufacturing uses machinery, but manpower is equally important. If we want a large amount of manpower, we must be in the city. If we want low wages, we must be in the countryside. This depends on the situation and long-term considerations. There are no fixed principles. Demand is sales. The most consumption is in cities. Some things are needed more urgently and more in the countryside than in cities, so the location of our factory is based on the above three principles.</p>
<p>(2) Types of Buildings</p>
<p>The factory-style buildings, in terms of theory, have the following four types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. There is no fixed standard, and it depends on the nature of the factory. For example, consider the following:</p>
